WASHINGTON MAY HAVE
A WHIPPING POST.
PHO33CT m$m f^vor
SUGGESTED BY THE PRESIDENT
Special Dispatch to The CalL
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON. Dec. 25. â In conse
quence of a single passage in President
Roosevelt's annual message to Con-
GTcss a movement has been started
In the District of * Columbia which
may result in the establishment of a
whipping- post for wife-beaters in the
national capital. In his message the
President said:
"There are certain forms of brutal
ity and cruelty toward the weak
which need a special type of punish
ment- The wife-beater, for example,
is Inadequately punished by imprison
ment, for imprisonment may often
mean nothing to him, while lr may
cause hunger to the wife and children
who have been the victims of his
brutality. Probably some form of cor
poral punishment would be the most
adequate way cf meeting this kind of
crime."
Interviews with clergymen, police
officials. Judges and others who come
into touch with the criminal classes
show that there is a strong Eentlment
In favor of setting up a whipping post

Freeial rHsoatch to The CalL
CHICAGO, Dec. 25.â A fortune of
J20.000 and a sweetheart are the Christ
mas gifts which have been brought to
Mi*s Harriet Bwigert of Ablngdon, 111.
Miss Swicert made a heavy bid for
fame by throwing herself upon the
ehoulcer of Senator Cullom and kissing
him rapturously last Tuesday because
he had obtained the discharge of her
sweetheart, John Pierce, from the Hos
pital Corps of the United States Army
just as he was to be sent to the Philip
pines.
Pierce was planning to marry Miss
Bwigert during the holidays and had
applied for a discharge on that ac
count, but early in the week he learned
that he was to be sent across the Pa
cific and wired to his bride-elect to that
effect. Bhe immediately went to Wash
ington and prevailed upon Senator Cul
lom to obtain the young man's dis
cto&rsre from army duty.
At this time she knew nothing of the
fortune awaiting her, and only yester
day Ehe was advised that about $60,000
from the estate of her grandfather,
Daniel G- Burner, was to be divided
between her brother and herself.

BAZON, Russian Poland. Dec. 2Z.
After the midnight mass at the Roman

was killed.
The San Francisco Call.
Y. Satterlee, Bishop of Washington,
siid:
"By whipping only, I believe, can
this form of contemptible crime be
reached effectively- It is a matter of
grave concern, and the arguments
raised against the present system of
punishment, consisting of fines and
imprisonment that fall far more heavily
upon the wives and children of offend
ers than vi'On the offenders them
selves, are true. By whipping I do not
mean that the man who beats his wife
should be unmercifully flogged or
lashed ' into insensibility. I would
r?ther advocate for such a man a
whipping, which, while it might not
tear his skin and lacerate his body,
would cut with stinging force into his
ecnsibilites and shame him."
A great majority of clergymen in
Washington favor the whipping post.
Several preachers oppose the idea as
tending to brutality and Rev. Tunis
Shamlln says whipping would be as
unsuccessful as lynching.
The sentiment, however, is bo
strongly in favor of trying the experi
ment that it is likely a bill will be in
troduced in Congress when it reassem
bles after the holiday recess.

MILLIONS
FOR DEPOT
BUILDINGS
Preclal Dispatch to The Call
CHICAGO. Dec. 25,â Thirty million
dollars is the sum which the Pennsyl
vania Railroad Company is prepared
to spend in constructing a new rail
way station in Chicago. Twenty mil
lions of â¢ this sum will be used in ac
quiring land adjoining*, the present
Union Depot, to make the site com
mensurate with the enterprise, and
$10,000,000 will be expended on build
ings. When the work is completed
Chicago will have one of the largest
railway terminals in the world.
The site of the new terminal, as
planned by the architects and engineers
of the Pennsylvania Company, will oc
cupy seven square blocks of territory.
In this territory it is the intention of
the company to erect a group of sup
ply and storage warehouses and a
huge freight warehouse and passenger
depot. In its magnitude the plan of the
Pennsylvania company surpasses that
which has been carried out in the city
of Washington, where more than $25,
000,000 was expended.

CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, Dec. 25.â Conditions
bordering upon anarchy, caused by
President's Castro's despotic rule in
Venezuela; are known in detail to the
State Department. American interests
which have suffered have importuned
the department to take some radical
action to assure them protection. For
eign interests have been so outraged
that the use of force by one or more
European Governments in behalf of
their citizens depends only on whether
or not the United States is disposed to
act as policeman in Venezuela.
England, Italy and Germany, the
powers which formed a special alliance
to coerce Venezuela into the payment
of long-standing claims in 1902, are dis
gusted with the attitude of President
Castro. They have made it known, to
the. United State in no uncertain terms
that they would welcome action by the
United States in bringing pressure to
bear upon President Castro. . Y:'-
Eiihu Root's speech on the' Monroe
doctrine -and the "big 6tick" before-the,
New England Society in New York on
Thursday.-, was '.. regarded by; many. In
Washington as the forerunner of strong
action against President Castro, possi
bly in the shape of .warships in Vene
zuelan waters. . Root's speech was dou
bly >lgniflcant, as there-has been more
or less Inspired newspaper comment re
cently regarding the obligation of the
United States to keep turbulent repub
lics,in order, instead of permitting Eu
ropean Governments to, do it, at the
risk of violating the Monroe doctrine.
It is admitted that the situation in
Venezuela is extremely serious; that
European Governments are getting so
tired of wasting time and diplomacy
that they are almost willing to adopt
stronger means, but would prefer that
the United States should do it.
President Roosevelt has declared re
peatedly that he would rather take the
responsibility for making the South
American republics live up to their ob
ligations than see English, German,
Italian or French warships coming
across the seas to do it.

ST. PAUL, Dec 25.â On! the eve of the
convening of the State Legislature to

a candidate for re-election.' J. B. Gil

sensational Republican - Senator-elect
Frank Haskell says in ; a published
statement:
"I was offered $1000 to make a public

strongly advocates the enactment of
laws for the control of railroad freight
and . passenger t rates. Of his \ fight
against the merger he has nothing to
say except a recital of the. facts.
It was owing to, the fact that Senator
Clapp has failed to satisfactorily de
fine his position on tariff revision' and
Control of railroad rates and the belief
that he was the candidate favored by
the railroads that the spontaneous de

The Harold Dollar Brings
Account of War Between
Men and Beasts.
Inhabitants of One Settlement Rill
x 150 Animals in a Day and Ship
Their Pelts on Steamer.
Captain M. H. Thwing of the steamer
Harold Dollar, which returned yes
terday morning from the eastern coast
of Siberia with a very valuable cargo
of furs, tells of an invasion of the cities
and villages on the east coast of the
Kamchatkan Peninsula , by hundreds
of starving Siberian bears. The fero
cious animals, driven from the moun
tains by hunger, made their way to the
inhabited regions of the coast and for
days kei>t the natives in a state of
semi-seige. In Ustakamchatka, a
small town near the city of Petropau
lovski, one hundred and fifty of the
savage brutes were . shot in a single
day, as they roamed among the houses
in search of food.
During this day, which was the worst
of all, only one of the natives ventured
to leave his house, and he was attack
ed and killed by the bears. After the
brutes had 'been killed or driven from
the village, the body of this man was
found partly devoured near, his house.
The hungry animals "even tried to tear
their way into the houses and but for
the: fact i that the natives, who make
their living by . hunting* were well pro
vided with fire arms, many human lives
would have been- lost. â¢ -V -."-[' 'I " ; .
In Petropaulovskl. which- is a largo
sea' port on I A vatcha Bay on - the { the
southeast point â of the Peninsula of
Kamchatka*, f our- betrr^ were Â£ shot . in
the ; streets - in one. day ' and, a* young
cub, captured alive, .was brought to
San Francisco on -the Harold Dollar.
For '.days' there .was a veritable reign of
terror in;the .- city. / The i school'- was
closed, .and". women and children re
mained in their homes, while bands of
armed men patrolled the streets night
and: day hunting bears among the
houses. . - ' _; : â  ,
VMaiy.of the smaller, towns: and fish-
Ing villages along the coast were at
tacked by the starving . bears, but at
none of these places was the number
killed sq large as at. Ustakamchatka.
Captain ..Thwine at his home in Oak
land yesterday gave the,following-ac
count of the invasion 1 of the bears, the
skins of many of which are now packed
in the hold of the Harold Dollar, await
ing 'shipment to London:
"These bears live In the range of mountains
which runs through the center ot the peninsu
la X)l*- Kamchatka, and they live for the most
parn- J on salmon which they â¢ catch from . the
river* and streams. As nearly as I could learn,
the natives think the salmon did not run far
enough â¢ up the- rivers this year for the bears
to lay in their ueusl store provisions, and as
ihe .winter came on the animals were driven
by starvation to seek food on the sea coast.
..While the steamer ; was at Petropaulovjkl
the bears attacked a number of villages along
the coast, and at Ustakamchatka one hundred
and. fifty were shot in one day from the win
dows of houfieK. These bears weigh about 90o
or - 1000 pounds, and when . hungry are very
savage. The sUins of nearly all the bears that
were killed at Ustakamchatka were sold to thÂ«
company, and were among the cargo brought
to San Francisco on the Harold Dollar. . .
A rumor was started ' on the water
front yesterday that the Harold Dollar
had; been chased and fired upon by a
Japanese cruiser, on the homeward voy
age* but Captain Thwing ridiculed the
story. ; Ho said:..
< We left the â Siberian coast on December 10.
and did not even Â«eea ship of any kind until
we were : within sight: of. the Golden Gate. In
fact, v/e did not see any vessel whatever after
we , were two days out from Seattle on our
voyage toithe coast of Siberia.
. I have no idea where the story of our being
chased by, a Japanese cruiser originated, un
less it was told by some member ot the crew
as a Joke. Had any Japanese vessel chased
us we should have been â  captured, for the
Dollar is not a fast ship, and had we been
caught the f Japs' would have got a rich prize,
for our cargo of seal, sable and- sea otter furs
Is valued at about $SC0.CCO.

visit to thlscity.'-' Other "railroad mag
nates throughout the., country are ex
pee'ed to follow Hughitt's example.
Hughltt contended that not only wouKl
the railroads suffer through the legis
lation proposed by President Roosevelt;
but cities in all parts of the country
would be restricted in their growth, be
cause of Inability to reach out for trade
beyond "their own little garden plots."
In Hughitfs opinion, such legislation
as President Roosevelt proposed would
produce uniformity that would be a
death blow to competition.
Some of the railroad men are In
clined to accept Secretary Morton's In
vitation and assist In a settlement of
the question. There Is a firm belief
that the President is determined and
proposes sooner or later to have a new
law, but a large majority, it 1Â» said,
have held aloof, while many are act
ively fighting the proposition.
It was thought that when Secretary
Morton's plan was announced, includ
ing legalized pooling, together with
Government supervision of rates, the
railroad presidents would at least fall
in with this, but there has been a dis
tinct disappointment in administration
circles over this phase of the case.
and the President is actively preparing
his campaign, knowing that he will
face the almost united opposition of the
railroads

MOROCCO OFFERS FIELD .
FOR AMERICAN TRADE
Standard Oil the Only Industry of the
Country Doing Business
There.
NEW YORK, Dec. 25.â James Lang
'â rman, formerly United ' States Vice-
Consul General at Tangier, 'Morocco, is
in New York on his way to report to
the Sultan of Morocco, whose personal
reprcfrntative he was at the St. Louis
exposition. Speaking to-night of Mo
rocco and its desire for American
tradf. LanRcrman said:
"Never before was such an oppor
tunity presenttd to American industries
to secure a foothold in Morocco. , It
seems strange, but it is a fact, never
theless, that in this country, where
about -IjR,000,000 people live, there is but
one big American industry doing busi
ness, and that is the Standard Oil
Company. .:'â â¢ v â¦
"The -Sultan, and, in fact, all his
subjects, want to trade with Ameri
cans. They realize that the American
people in business will treat them fair
ly and will not try to seize the coun
try. I know personally that the Sultan
is one of the most ardent admirers of
President Roosevelt.
"It is impossible for French troops
tj make any progress in Morocco, es
pecially at this time of the year. They
have a difficult task before them. It
Is now the rainy season. It Is impos
sible for them to transport troops, as
there are no highways- Ferrying is
their most modern method of crossing
rivers. There is not a telegraph or
telephone line or railway in the coun
try." V-i
Langerman recently discussed the
Moroccan situation with the President,
but he refused to say whether he vis
ited President Roosevelt on any par
ticular mission.
Prosperity in New England.
Those people who are inclined to
look upon New England industries as
retrograding and think that our man
ufacturing industries are going to
other sections of the country will be
surprised to learn that within the last
thr?o years, without any increase of
mileage whatever, the Boston and
2Iaine Railroad has shown a gross in
crease in business of more than $4,
000.000. The "reaction" in, New Eng
land has been most unwarrantably ex
aggerated. There is a certain hesi
tancy on the part of local manufac
turers to increase their outputs during
a Presidential year and the volume of
merchandise transportation is affected
thereby, but on the whole men en
eacd in the transportation business
regard the 'conditions as normal, and
ther- seenip lo be no diminution in the
energy of the producers. Under such
conditions tho railroads, which are
Indices of general prosperity, are on
the whole doing very well. â Boston

KING DODO HAS
CHRISTMAS TREE
Jolly Old 3Ionarcli at the
.Tivoli Not Forgotten by
-Props," Stage Carpenter
NEW BILL AT OEPHEUM
"Shore Acres ' at the Califor
nia Is Well Played and
Pleases Large Audience
A realistic touch of Christmas in the
setting of a clever transfoi-mation scene
was an attraction worth waiting for
at the close of the performance of
"King Dodo" at the Tivoli matinee'yes
terday. There was a fair-sized audi
ence, considering the home allurements
of Yuietitie. The opera -.vas rendered
with customary excellence, and then
came the Christmas-tree arrangement.
The transformation opened with the
appearance of . Santa Glaus, who
stepped from a great wreath of holly
framing a winter scene. Old Kris
Kringle sar.g a song from the nursery
rhymes with new construction and
warned his hearers at the end of each
verse '"To be careful, very careful." A
tr-bleaux with two little girls, one rep
resenting wealth and the other poverty,
vas then presented. One little girl was
burdened with bundles and the other
looked wistfully in at a store window
where toys were stacked high. The
scer.i* changed to the humble fireplace
of a poor man's home with a child nod
ding and dreaming of the approaching
Christ day. Another change and the
rich man's home showed a contrasting
p'cture. The finale was when Santa
Claus selected from a well-ladened
Christmas tree presents for both the
rich and the poor, and the little daugh
ter of the rich hands her gift to
her less-fortunate companion.
The youngsters in the audience
seemed to be greatly pleased with the
Tivoli stage manager's clever concep
tion: . . â¢
The mueh-talked-about road *show
vap on the boards at the Orpheum last
night once again and a better bill never
was seen at the popular vaudeville
house. Each number is a stellar at
tract (on,, keeping the audience busy try
ing to .figure out which is 'the best
number on the bill. As usual. Mcln
tyre and Heath were greeted with
cheers, shouts and all kinds of applause
when they came on for their turn. They
handed out "The -Georgia Minstrels"
and did it as only they can. Clarice
Vance, the favorite singer of - coon
sonrs, had a collection that, was new
and several encore? were her lot. The
Latonas, Frank and Jen, are musical
artists that one does not see every day
fn vaudeville. Their reception last
night was a hearty one and well dfe
eervlng. Probst, the great imitator, en
tertained the audience for several min
utes with some of his latest and most
captivating imitation!?. The Four Mil
linery Maids made their bow to a San
Francisco audience, as did Spessardy
and his troupe of great trained bears
and ponies. This act is a marvelous
one. -illustrating what patience can do
with wild- beasts. Harry SmirL and
Rose Kessner are dancers and tum
blers well -worth going to. see, while
Albertina Melich and her trained -par
rots were as interesting aÂ« of yore, j â 
Christmas week began at the Califor
nia Theater. last night with the open
ing production of James A. Hearne's
famous New England seacoast drama
"Shore Acres." .The first performance
was to have been the matinee, but ow
ing to the late arrival of the scenery
car, the performance had to be post
poned. Last night, however, the Buah
street playhouse was filled with an au
dience that thoroughly enjoyed the pro
duction and tested the drawing capa
city of the quaint play.
James T. Galloway, as Nat Berry, the
part made famous by Herne. was. sur
prisingly good, as was Miss; Frances A.
Denson as Helen. Miss Denson gave a
forceful presentation of the character,
and at all times lcoked and acted the
part.
Atkins Lawrence, as the hard-hearted
brother, Martin, and Belle Theodore as
his wife Ann were canably portrayed.
The children of the companyâ Minnie
Cano. Little Valentine, and David Tay
lorâshow unusual talent. The remain
der of the cast consists. of "bits" that
were acceptably filled. "Shore Acres"
will run for the week. . , . .
Passport to Newport Society.
Spendthrift ancestors have left many
cf the nobility with vast establishments
which they are not able to maintain,
and it has become their ambition to
rent their country homes to rich Amer
icans. The number of the latter who
care to spend any long time in England
is limited and other means to extract
dollars from aspiring Americans have
been adopted. For example, the lease
of an Englishman's yacht may contain
the -provision that the nobleman and
certain of his titled friends shall visit
the vessel at stated times. This is the
simplest road of the parvenu million
aire to swell â¢ society. To have had as
hjs guests persons of title is a sure
passport to the best circles of Newport.

prospect of the Guatemalan Govern

San Francisco. CaLBLESSING OF PROSPERITY IS GOD'S CHRISTMAS GIFT
TO GRATEFUL PEOPLE
IMPRESSIVE HIGH MASS SU/1Q
Iffl ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCHES
POOR OF CITY FEAST
/ AND ARE MADE HAPPY
INSPIRING nUSIC SUNG BY GREAT CHOIRS
There is an old adage that says
"gratitude is a lively sense of favors
to come." Christmas eve found San
Francisco filled with Just this sort of
gratitude and Christmas day brought
with it all that God and nature have
to offer in warm sunshine and the
happy knowledge of the bountlfulness
of a year that has been manifold in its
blessings for all men of the prosperous
West.
Peace was on earth â the calm of the
perfect â winter day and the happy faces
of the good-natured, jostling Christmas
crowds proved this. Within the bright
ly lighted dining halls, in the quarters
of the rich and poor; in the long, un
decorated rooms of the city's charita
ble institutions, and even In the nar
row. Impoverished quarters of the Pest
house the light of human kindness en
tered and brought with it a Christmas
cheer that meant much td those who
have to depend for opportunity to for
tet their afflictions upon the unselfish
ness of the charitably inclined.
The Salvation Army has prepared to
feed thousands of homeless ones at its
dinners to-day, and great tables will
be loaded down with roast turkey and
good things to eat, of which California
is so prolific. The orphans were not
forgotten, and In every Catholic and
Protestant orphan asylum the little
waifs were treated to gifts of toys,
candy, fruits, nuts, and they ended
the happy day with feasts of turkey,
cranberry sauce and abundant sweets.
Special services were held in all of
the churches on this and the other side
of the bay. The musical programmes
in most of the places of worship were
extensive, and nearly every regular
'â¢hoir was augmented by choruses of
trained voices selected from among the
best-known vocalists.
High mass was celebrated at the
Cathedral and all of the Catholic
churches. There was an unusually
liirge attendance of the devotees of the
laith. Archbishop Montgomery deliv
ered the sermon at the 11 o'clock high
mass at the Cathedral. The Rev. David
Kvans delivered the sermon at
Grace Episcopal Church, the Rev. Wal
ter M. White at the West Side Chris
tian Church, the Rev. W. K. Guthrie
at the First Presbyterian Church, the
Rev. George C. Adams at the First
<'ongregational Church and the Rev.
L,. J. Sawyer at the Hamilton Baptist.
Special services were also held at the
Simpson Memorial, Swedish Lutheran,
California - street Methodist Episco
pal and Bethlehem Congregational
churches. Evening services were as
well attended as those of the morning.
Many of the Sunday-schools had
Christmas-tree gatherings, at which
informal receptions were held for the
old folks.
About the city the day was spent in
an unusually quiet manner. There was
a fairly large attendance at the beach
and Golden Gate Park, but travel
across the bay and to near-by towns
was very large. Few accidents were
rpported.
The garrisons of the Presidio, Fort
'Mason and the other military posts
about the bay were granted two holi
days, only sufficient men being detailed
*to maintain the guard lines. In many
of the company quarters the troops got
up elaborate Christmas dinners. The
pailor boys from the training ship Buf
falo. Mare Island navy yard and the
Terba Buena station were ashore in
large squads, and had a Jolly good
time on their "shore leave." A fine
meal was prepared for the tars at their
respective quarters.
To-day being a legal holiday many
persons will remain out of the city on
visits to friends and relatives in the
country. The sale of tickets for Inte
rior towns was large.
Homelife of Ration Is
Rector's Theme.
Rev. David Evans Lauds
Great S atesmen.
Th ere wa s the usual beautiful
Christmas music at Grace Church,
California and Stockton streets, and
wiihin the chancel rails the floral dec
ovations were most prettily and ef
fectivelv arranged.
The choir, under the direction of
William H. Holt, the organist and
choirmaster. rendered the sacred
music perfectly, among the numbers
b<-:ng Buck's "Te Deum" in E flat and
â¢Jubilate' (Gilchrist) in A flat and
for the offertory Homer Henley, solo
ist and the choir rendered "Come.
Gentles. Rise." the poem by David
Evans and music by Horatio W. Par
ker.
In his sermon the Rev. David
Evan?, the rector, said:
The home Is the unit of civilization, and the
love of country has its rise In family affec
tion, eo that the force* which tend to disinte
grate thÂ« homelife of a nation are a direct
tr.rnar* to the very life of that nation.
In nothing have America and England Â«Â«t a
betur example to the rest of the world than
in this that their representative men. their
prime rrinli'tprs and Presidents have for many
n Ion* yÂ«-ar been men who have reverenced
i !.< ir own homes, and realized the picture of
that perfect knight of Arthur's court, who
" loved one woman only, clove to her and wor
rhiiÂ«>d her with yeans of noble deeds until
df-ath parted them. For fifty yean Mr. Glad
rt(.ne el-.owed his countrymen the example ol
en idrid family. Hia great rival. Lord Bea
consfleld. was devoted to his wedded wife
IÂ»rd Salifbury'B perfect attachment to the
â¢ Ruth of nlÂ« fireside reads like an exquisite
Idyl. la the White House to-day the first
A rr.eriean haa enshrined an Ideal home while
the hallowed memory of his jrreat predecessor
will alwaye be associated with thÂ« affection
lavlsihed upon the invalid partner of his life
Yet, In eplte of these usining examples the
Kencral outlook to-day is of evil oraen for
the fan.l!y as en institution, and It does look
as though the rampant Bplrit of a sclf-wiUed
individualism were fated to destroy it. and
break up society Into discordant units. In
very few home* to-day is there any domestic
communion. Each member of the family acts
independently of the others. There Is no true
home life or Intercourse, and certainly nothing
that can be called religion* sympathy.
We hear the leading men of America, our
preachers, and ttatesgnen, and aortal reformers.
deploring the widespread spirit of lawlessness
that is abroad in the land. How shall you
wonder at it when the family is lawless, and
parent*, with no religious convictions of their
own. allow their children to make their own
environment and grow up anyhow.
It roust be understood that the weak and
pliant panÂ»nt who does not care or know how
to train up his children and govern his own
household is an enemy of the republic.
The message that comes at Christmas day
to every Christian parent is that which was
given to Boaz on the day when he took Ruth
the Moh bites* to wife:
â¢'Do thou worthily in Eppratah and be thou
famous in thy home life at Bethlehem."
Pro found Services At
the Cathedral.
Archbishop Montgomery
Gives Benediction.
At St. Mary's Cathedral the services
were observed with great solemnity.
The music in the morning was mag
nificently rendered and the sermon by
the Rev. Father Jerome B. Hannigan
was deeply impressive.
Archbishop Agius, the apostolio
delegate to Manila, sang the pontifical
mass and Archbishop Montgomery
grave the papal benediction. In the
evening the Rev. Father J. W. Sulli
van of Menlo Park delivered the ser
mon and said in part:
All this joy coming from the Savior who is
Christ the Lord is to those only who know
and foilow him. Unto us indeed, a child is
born. If we can say that he is our Savior,
who is Christ the Lord, then we have the Joy
that is given to all the people In its truest
form. The more completely you know him
and are like him the fuller will your happiness
become.
There has lived no great or pood man since
his cominr who has not been influenced by
his word and works. The nearer you approach
to him the nobler, the kinder, the greater you
are.
The decorations were exceedingly
handsome, the altars being ablaze
with numerous lights and the superb
poinsettia.
Takes Three Themes .
For His Sermon
Rev. Haterius Explains
the Celebration.
There were beautiful services at the
Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Ebe
nezer Church, Dolores street. The edi
fice was crowded and the sermon by
the Rev. C. J. E. Haterius, the pastor,
was deeply impressive-
At thÂ£ first service the theme was
"Why We Celebrate Christmas" and
the Rev. Mr. Haterius said:
ThÂ« whole world before and at the time of
the birth of Jesus was anxiously waltlnsr for
something, or some one, to come and teach
the truth and satisfy their spiritual hunger.
The pagans had discarded their gods, poly
theism was well-night dead, and the religious
vacuum in the hearts- and conscience of the
peoole cried for light and truth. Their many
and excellent philosophical systems could not
satisfy. They were light without warmth and
life, beautiful buildings that could not be oc
cupied, fountains and rivers that would not
yield a drop of water for weary and thirsty
souls. ,-â¢.- â¢ -
Christ came according to the promises, and
was born in Bethlehem, the Savior of the
world. And therefore we celebrate Christ
mas.
At the second service the theme was
"How Shall We Celebrate Christmas?"
and the Rev. Mr. Haterius gave the an
swer that we shall consider what we
are and what we need and what "we
want We are Blnners, he said, and we
need a Savior and we want to be saved.
The theme at the evening service was
"What Benefit Does the Right Celebra
tion of Christmas Confer?" to which
the pastor replied:
The benefits are spiritual contentedness and
hai>r>inÂ«ES. The spiritually contented and
har^y is always rich, get what ho needs day
br day, dees not need to worry, lays all care
and sorrow at the feet of his Savior, has a
bright future, a very large inheritance, a
beautiful home awaiting his arrival â only a
short Journey and he will be there.
Rev. I. Williams Sees
Truer Sympathy.
Believe? a Nobler Love
Will Cheer World.
Simpson Memorial Methodist Epis
copal Church was handsomely decorat
ed and the service was intensely Im
pressive. The Rev. James H. N. Wil
liams, the pastor, In ?- eloquent ser
mon said:
Tar back In the world's history â two thous
and years nowâ in the quiet little village of
Bethlehem, in the land of Palestine, there
occurred an event, which for significance and
far reaching importance has had no parallel,
and can have no, parallel In all ths affairs of
men. It was the birth of the world's redeem
er. Every multiplying decade and every in
creasing . century but adds to the world- wids
significance of that event; and in its far-ex
tending celebration this Christmas will witness
the widest interpretation of its true and es
sential meaning the world has ever seen.
Cnrist'a banners will float . from more hill
tops, Christmas carols will be eung in more
valleys, the gospel story will be repeated In
more villages than ever before since the dawn
of our era. A truer sympathy, a broader phll
anthrophy, a nobler love will cheer and warm
this old world of ours this Christmas tide than
erer before. â¢ / â¢ _ â 
This muet be true, since Chriet's plans to up
lift the world have not - and cannot â¢ fail ; ' and
â¢lncÂ« his truth, as a great moral and spiritual
force, silently, mightily â¢ and pervasively ex

The wilding star led those who followed it
to Eethlchcm, where they found an infant
in his mother's arms: but more than infant â
a King, King of the Jews, their King; King of
the world. Their hopes were met, and they
returned U> their own country satisfied with
the result of their long and perilous Journey.
They saw the star, but desired him â "where
is he?" The star was an Inspiration, a guide.
It led to Christ. All pilgrimages fail that do
not lead to him. Finding him we find the
world's great door of hope. He reveals man
to himself and God to us all. He is QoJ
manifest in the flesh. He is the son of Mary
â most honored of women; but he is also the
son of God. He is divine â the god-man. With
out him Christianity is foundationless. and has
no claim on our faith. With him it is a.miracu
lous system full of God; full of man; full of
love; full of life. He has found

Savior Is the World's
Greatest Leader.
Rev. G. HouQh Explains
Meaning of Day.
"Significance of Christmas" was the
subject of a profound sermon by the
Rev. George A. Hough at the Cali
fornia-street Methodist Episcopal
Church, who, in part, said:
Christmas commemorates the central fact of
historyâ the birth of a babe at Bethlehem.
An Insignificant event, you might have eaid
had you stood that day and looked into his
baby face. But his little hand came to hold
a scepter mightier than that of Alexander and
his childish lips spake words that shook the
world.
Christ was both son of God and son of man.
He brought God down and lifted man up so
that God and man met in him. He was an
ambassador from the city of the *kics on a
mission of mercy and love. He was an ad
vocate with the Father pleading .for a sinful
world. And thus his coming meant more to
humanity than wac realized on that first
Christmas or is realized by us nineteen cen
turies later. The angels knew, for they eang
'â¢Glory to God. on earth peace, good will
toward men." \
Humanity will never outgrow the old sweet
story. The babe of Bethlehem was' God's
greatest and best gift to man. Chriat -will
ever be the world's Ideal character, its in
comparable leader and man's perfect Savior
The , programme of civilization is but to work
out and realize the ideals , that . he brought' to
us. Christ in you the hope of glory is true of
the individual soul and of the race. - -
He catr.e to save; to make us God's chil
dren, brothers all; to drive selfishness up the
creaking steps of the gallows and to lead love
through the marble stairway to the golden
throne. This is the. spirit of Christ and of
Christmas â love regnant. â¢ In the dominance
not of law but of love, lies the hope of the
race. Then ring ye Christmas bells the chorus
of the Bkles: God Is my Father, Christ my
Savior, man my brother.
Message of Angels Is
Given Anew.
Dr. W. M. White Delivers
Profound Sermon.
"The Message of the Angels" was
the theme of the sermon delivered by
the Rev. Walter M. White, D. "D., at
the West Side Christian Church!
Dr. White said:
The birth of JesuÂ« was of universal mo
ment. All earth and heaven was challenged to
give glory to God on account of this, the
greatest of all events. The angels declare that
there is no part of the whole universe where
praises unto God are not to be rendered for
the gift of his son to save a lost and perish
inp world. On earth .there must be peace, for
the prince of peace 'has come â not peace in
the sense of cessation of war and strife be
tween man and man â no. for they shall con
tinue until the end of time. THÂ« American
revision of thÂ« New Testament says. Peace
unto menâ "men in whom, he is well
pleased."
The prime requisite of acceptance' with God
Is faith. They that believe in him will strive
to do his will, and to such is "the message
of the angels" â peace among men in â¢ whom
he is well pleased.
These angel messages! What welcome news
they have borne: To the oppressed they have
declared a deliverer at hand; to the despair-
Ing, hope: to the poor and neglected, the
promise of food, clothing and a home; to the
sinner, a savior, and .to the whole world thÂ«
message of a better time coming.
Poinsettia Gorgeous
Color Adornment.
Rev. Guthrie Preaches
'Mid Flowers.
The customary Christmas services
were held at the First Presbyterian
Church, .on Van Ness avenue. V The
handsome Gothic interior, with its nat
ural wood finish, was beautified by'dec^
orations of green fir boughs," to ' which
were added gorgeous dashes of color
from red Christmas berriesand the rich
red blooms of the poinsettia.
The ; service was mostly choral, the
chants and anthems of Christmas tide
being delightfully rendered by the
choir.
The Rev, William Kirk Guthrie took
as the theme of his sermon the story of
Jacob's dream at Bethel and brought
out with force and beauty the analogy
of the ladder of the dream and the liv
ing way by which air men may climb
from earth to heaven. â¢
â He said in Jesus Christ, whose birth
the whole world unites in celebrating
to-day, we have the ladder let down by
God from, heaven.to earth..; , Its.:, foot
rests on earth among men In Christ's
humanity and its top rests on>- the
throne of God in his divinity. -.5; v-- : *

GOTHAM UNDER SNOW MANTLE.
NEW YORK, Dec. 25.â New York City
was treated to a Christmas snowstorm,
accompanied by a high wind and a de
cided drop in the temperature.^ . Shortly
after noon the first flakes began to fall.
With the snow came a; gradual increase
in the velocity of | the -wind, which '-by,
10 o'clock to-night was ; blowing thirty
miles an â¢ hour. '. : At . that, time ; between
four and five inches of snow, had 'fallen,"
which brought the record for the mo'nth
up â¢ to . twenty-nine inches, the heaviest
snowfall for December recorded here in
many years.
In spite of the storm there was no
lack of ; interest in the celebration of
Christmas, throughput the city, al
though i the festivities were toned down
by â¢ Sunday solemnity and in some i in-"
stances were held in abeyance until to
morrow. Churches werejwell attended

The negroes had been standing on
the street corners yelling "Merry
Christmas!" at every one who passed
and demanding money to buy drinks.
Two policemen attempted to arrest the
gang and were knocked down and
beaten. They did not shoot for fear
of hUting onlookers. The firemen and
citizens joined in the battle, which
was waged for nearly half an hour.
When the negroes were about to be
taken to Jail there were cries from the
crowd of "Bring a rope!" and "Lynch
them!"
The policemen warned the more ex
cited citizens to keep away, but mem
bers of the crowd got close enough
to strike the negroes. A crowd stood
about the jail (for hours. All through
the day and in both Plainfleld and
North Plainfleld there were frequent
tilts between white men and negroes.

HARBOR BILL
TO BE PASSED
Knowland Thinks That the
Measure Will Go Through
' but It Will Be Cut Down
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Dec. 25.
Joseph R. Knowland, Congressional
Representative, from the Third Califor
â¢nia district, returned home from Wash
ington last evening. in 4ime td'epend
Christmas eve with his family in his
Alameda home. Mr. Knowland is. the
only member of the California delega

and his. outline, of the .popspects- of the

* The fnost important statement made
by Mr. Knowland was in regard to the
river and harbor bilL There have been
rumors Irom Washington that there
would be no such bill passed by Con-
KTtss this y*-ar because of a desire to
economize, .and these rumors have had
frequent expresion in telegraphic
ttories. Mr. Knowland thinks that such
.a bill will be passed, though there is a
decides effort ui>on the part of Chair
man Burton of the Committee on
Rivers and Harbors to keep such a bill
within limits. Mr. Knowland said:

HEBREW IDEA
OF CHRISTMAS
Rabbi 31. Fifedlander, Lea'd :
ing Jewish Divine of Oak
land, on Great Christian Day
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
101C Broadway, Dec 25.
The ideas, of a' Jewish rabbi UDon
Christinas at Christmas ume. Years
ago this would have seemed an impos
sibility, but Rabbi M. Friedlander of
the FirsJL Hebrew Congregation of Oak
land has come boldly forward and re
corded his opinions in an article that
has Just been given to the public. The
Rabbi has treated Christmas from the
point of view of his religion, and he
has treated it fearlessly, and as he sees
it. These ideas, as written and pre
pared by the rabbi himself, are of in
terest, and among the points he brings
out are the following:
- TVhetlxr Chrtatmaa is the birthday of Jesus
of Nazareth, aa Is believed by orthodox
churchmen, or it is a survival of the heathen
Sturcalia taken up and embellished with ad
ditional solemnity by the church, as is claimed
by the Inquiring student. aU enter heartily in
the celebration of the day as a festival of good
cheer and social enjoyment. People of ail f alt h.->,
and of no faith, equally Join In the merry ob
servance of the day in rlvlcs and receiving,
presents. Many among .the Jews, especially
among the Jewish children. Join in the general
festivities of CbriBtmas and exchange greetings
and glfta .with their Christian neighbors .and
friends out of a spirit of fellowship and friend
liness. Tear by year the religious significance
of the day is noticeably shifted farther to' the
background, and the social feature of It is' be
coming more prevalent. Most people, even
tbote of Christian parents and Christian train-
Ing, when asked why they observed Christmas
give as the answer, "Because every one else
did." A <Say on which ordinary vocation U
suspended, friendship exchanged, sumptuous
meals are prepared, the family assembled, and
the children are enjoying a merry good time,
should receive a general welcome especially
by a generation so busy and rushed as we are,
no' matter what Us eric In. . . .
In Russia., where the church' keeps the people
In darkness, Christmas is generally marked by
violence and bloodshed committed by ignorant
zealots upon those who do not belong to the
Greek church. What a glaring instance of
how the power of Christianity is crippled by
the discipline of the church.
And while ' i-uch - bigotry and the evil re
sulting therefrom as exists to this day in
Eastern Europe are impossible In our land of
enlightenment, yet . the government of the
American church (or shall I say, the policy of,
the clergy) IB not entirely free from criticism.
The church refuses to entirely rid itself of the
old asoteric .doctribe; it still rigidly enforces
the principal - cf exclustraieps â it does not ad
mit any "outsider" to ita pulpit whose theo
logical exposition and scriptural exegesis are
presupposed to have different ' coloring from
tbosft given by the religious guide of ita own
camp. We can see no harm ensuing from pre
senting the significance of religion and an ap
prehension of God from different. grounds. One
might regard his religion* better than that of
others, but be cannot reasonably regard the
reilgios of others a mental disease whose in
fection is to be feared, when that religion
teaches the belief in God, who is the slnglo
guiding Dower of the world and perfect in a
humanity which emulates his goodness and
reachaa out after his holiness. If religion Is to
Influence every phase of human life, then life
cannot be complete without a full and clear
knowledge of every phase of human reason
ing on which our apprehension of God is based.
It la here the insistence by the church to pre
clude from ~ Ita gates - an* - Interchange â  of
thought, that the secular press In this coun
try, by its quick detection of what institu
tions fall . short, and subtle Insight of * the
people's needs, has made itself an Indispensable
supplement to the church.' â¢, ' â

DEATH DREAM
CAUSES A ROW
AVife Slayer Energetically
Protests Against Prophe
cies From Hindoo Jailmate
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, E>ec.'25. *
Half a riot was caused to-day in
the Grand Jury corridor of the Coun
ty Jail when Lemuel D. Campbell,
awaiting trial on a. charge of murder
ing, his wife, Laura Campbell, tongue
lashed Ramlna Aramancha Singh,
self -styled Prince, of India, a fellow
prisoner who had been giving pub
licity to strange dreams which, he as
serted,, he had experienced and -in
which Campbell had figured as the
victim of the law's .severest punish
ment. : - Â»
home of Campbell's friends told the
prisoner that Singh had announced
he -saw in visions the accused wife
slayer headed for the- Styx. Camp
bell did not enjoy the prophecy. In
fact, he demonstrated his wrath so ve
hemently that Jailer 'Harry. Clark was
called to quell the disturbance in the
corner occupied by the pair.
â¢'I. give you notice now," declared
Campbell,, addressing his dusky jail
mate, "that I'll beat your head off if
you send out any more stuff like that."
The threat was enough to give
Singh food for reflection and the
"prince" transferred his confidences to
David Kiniry, who is also held on a
murder charge. â¢ â  \<, .-.â 
Singh's tales about trance manifes
tations of. gibbets, ghastly skeletons,
eerie ghosts and . such like uncanny
visions with Campbell, as the central
figure were heralded as an evidence
of the dark-hued prisoner's metaphys
ical endowments. Out of. the realm
of the shades this devotee of. the oc
cult pretended to have drawn a horo
scope, of Campbell's fate. He 'painted
In a conglomeration of words a pic
ture of awful disaster. It was a hodge
podge* of grewsome prophecy.. >" â :
All of this, Singh averred, portend
ed the death of Campbell. Naturally
the Hindoo's utterances- -were s not
soothing and Campbell took offense
and strenuously i objected to hearing
his fate thus foretold. After the ex
plosion, Singh decided to v try,his luck
with Kiniry. â  The results were better.
The pair got together, on a commercial
basis. Â» For valuable ' consideration,
coin. in amount not 'mentioned, KiÂ»iry
agreed' to sell 'and deliver "to Singh
Fuch of his personal effects as Kiniry
feels he will not need again. These
consist of ' weatlng apparel, silver
ware and trinkets.
."'..Two â â weeks hence Singh .will be re
leased, after serving a sentence' of six
months' imprisonment.-; for. , thieving.
The. Jailers suspect he has some
scheme in mind by which to .realize
handsomely upon Kiniry's possessions.
But they are not in the confidence t of
the "prince." . . , -
Singh's Christmas to-day
consisted of a .visit from Miss Nellie

SAY ANDERSON
IS DANGEROUS
Detectives Eegard Man Cap
tured by Patrolman Sherry
as a Desperate Prisoner
TRY TO TRACE RECORD
Suspected Footpad Refuses
to Tell Where His Abode Is
Located in San Francisco
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Dec. 25.
Andrew Anderson, the vicious ap
pearing longshoreman, arrested yes
terday morning by Policeman John
Sherry, who found an ugly loaded pis
tol and a mask of black cloth on his
prisoner, has become the object of no
little solicitude on the part of the Po
lice Department.
Though the detectives do not put
much faith in their ability to connect
Anderson with the murder of Police
man George W. Brown they are sat
isfied that their prisoner is a danger
ous man equal to such a Crime.
Anderson has been given a close ex
amination. He has denied that he
killed Brown..but his denials are cou
pled with admissions that he waa
ready to use his pistol in any murder
ous way that would gain him chance
to get away after committing a crime.
Anderson has also told the police
that he would not hesitate to do rob
bery. In fact he has very strongly
impressed his questioners with the
fact that he was desperate and
despondent enough to stop at nothing.
Detectives have been trying to find
Anderson's room in San Francisco. He
told the police he had some personal
effects stored at a friend's residence
and there he had stayed for a while.
But he will not tell the authorities
where his abode has been in San
Francisco.
Chief of Police Hodgkins has not
been able to find explanation for An
derson's significant remark: "Well,
we got one of you fellows the other
night, any way," said to Patrolman
Sherry when he arrested the man.
That assertion applied to Brown's
murder, the detectives think, but they
cannot connect their prisoner. Young
Hersey, who was robbed shortly be
fore the killing of Brown, will be
asked to look at Anderson to-morrow,
as will others who were victims of
footpads the week of the policeman's
death. Hodgkins said to-day he had
no hope that Anderson could be iden
tified as the robber.
"Nevertheless," said the chief, "this
man is in such a desperate frame of
mind that he would stop at nothing.
He is a murderer at heart and has
said so. I do not feel to-day that he
can be held as a highwayman unless
he should be wanted in San Francisco
or in some other city: .. "We shall see
that he is sent to jail for the limit on
the., charge of carrying a concealed
weapon. Meanwhile every effort will
be made to trace Anderson's move
ments for some time past. -

Policeman and Saloonman
Bag Thief .Who Had Been
Overcome by Strong Drink
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
: 1016 Broadway, Dec* 25.*
. Not satisfied with breaking into J.
Chigllotti's saloon, .5093 .Telegraph
avenue, and plundering the cash regis
ter, Edward Howltt, a molder, 24 years
old, drank deeply of* the liquors he
found at his disposal and fell into a
deep, drunken slumber, on the floor in
front of the coin box he had rifled.
There Howitt was found by Policeman
W. H. Smith and Chigliotti at 3:30
o'clock this morning and carted off to
jail on a charge of burglary.
Smith was passing the saloon on pa
trol when his attention * waa attracted
by the noise of. the cash register bell
sounding.' The policeman noticed that
the place was dark and . locked. He
summoned Chigliotti. â  Stationing the
proprietor at the front door,. Patrolman
Smith went to the rear." â¢ There he saw
the backyard - littered with whisky bot
tles. A window was open and showed
where â  it had been forced. Smith
crawled into the saloon, flashed a light
and saw a man's form. stretched out
on the floor. The sleeper was dead
drunk.
â¢ Chigliotti was called in, and a search
was made that brought to light in the
prisoner's pockets three dimes, nine
nickels and two twenty-flve-cent pieces.
The saloon register was open. Chig
liotti said he had left in the till. three
dimes, nine nickels and one two-bit
piece. Upon this showing the somno
lent criminal was arrested for burglary.
He came to himself sufficiently to give
his name at the city prison. The police
think Howitt helped himself liberally
to the liquor stock before he opened the
machine, because It was not long, alter
Smith heard the bell sound that he re
turned with Chigliotti.

Jamf>s Merry. 48 years, and George Me
Millin, 24 years, died in a trap made by
themselves. Against the wishes of
their boarding-house keeper, .the three
men took a quantity of whisky to their,
room. They placed one of the two beds
of their apartment against the door to
prevent interference by the landlady.
After the men had retired a lighted
candle fell from a mantel on to some
greasy working clc-thes. The clothing
was ignited and the room was soon
filled with thick smoke. ,
McMillin was awakened by the
smoke, but was unable to move the
bed from the door and fell to the floor
unconscious. The bc-arding-house keep-,
er discovered the- smoke, and when the
room was broken into McCusker and
Merry were found dead. McMillin died
soon after being removed to a hospital.
At 1136 Fairmount avenue Edward
Rathtine, aged 25 years, and believed to
be a resident of New Jersey, was suffo
cated. It is believed he set the bed
clothes on fire with a lighted cigar, and
in trying to leave the room crawled
into a closet, where he was found dead.

TACOMA, Dec. 25. â The Christmas
season on the Puget Sound was
marred by one murder and two at
tempted murders.
Near Chehalis yesterday Thomas

Ten days ago Hevlri and ' his wife
quarreled, following which she went to
Brower's. Hevlri followed her yester
day for the supposed purpose of ef
fecting a reconciliation. As dinner
was concluded Hevlri drew a revolver
from his hip pocket and shot his wife,
inflicting a* serious wound. Brower
and his wife overcame Hevlri, bound
him and sent for an officer.

Cleveland Sheriff Leaves
for New York to Arrest

WIFE'S TEARFUL PLEA
Queen of "Frenzied Finan
ciers" Asserts That Her
Husband Is Guiltless
CLEVELAND, Dec. 25.â Sheriff Bar-
left for Albany and New York to-
Viay, carrying with 1 him the papers for
the arrest of Dr. Leroy S. Chadwick,
who is exoected to land at New York
from the . steamship Pretoria on
".Wednesday.
This afternoon Mrs. Chadwick
showed unusual nervousness. ' She
finally sent for the Sheriff, with the
statement that she wanted to talk over
the trip to New York and the impend
ing arrest of her husbana. The Sheriff
spent almost an hour with the woman
in her cell, during which time she wept
convulsively. .
"I know you will treat my husband
as kindly as possible, under the circum
stances, but please remember that he
is innocent qf any wrong-doing," said
Mrs. Chadwick as the Sheriff entered
the jail. ' ;
During tree hour that the Sheriff was
talking with Mrs. Chadwick she' re
peatedly asked him, to be kind to Dr.
Chadwick. The woman said it was an
awful mistake- . .- ; . ' '
"This is the worst thing that has
happened during all the trouble of the
last few weeks,". said Mrs. Chadwick.
"I never thought my husband would be
dragged into this affair. It is so un
just, for if ever an honest man lived it
is my husband."
Mrs. Chadwick asked the^ Sheriff^ to
tell her in detail of all of his plans.
Several times she referred to the doc
tor's daughter' b>\ a former wife, who
is returning with, Dr. Chadwick to this
country. The woman especially asked
the Sheriff to do everything possible
to make- the situation easy for the
young girl. â  ' â¢ *" V
"Remember all I have told you,"
called Mrs. Chadwick, as Sheriff Bar
ry was leaving. "This is terrible. But
there is one satisfactionâ I will see my
husband soon." 'â -*' ".

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 25.â Frank J.
Share, general manager, of the Pom

Nev.. who is here for the Christmas
holidays, says:
Searchlight is to-day one of the
very best mining camps in the South

years old. The Santa Fe engineers
have surveyed a line for an extension
of the railroad to the camp and we
anticipate having direct rail communi
cation before long. The camp is now
eighteen miles' from the Santa Fe and
twenty-five miles from the Salt Lake.
. Searchlight is now, ;a. non-union camp
and the. open .shop policy prevails
everywhere." There are a few mem
bers of the union left, but they work
as the employers say or quit.. The la

EXCELLENT HOLIDAY CONDITIONS.
T AST week was not a very interesting one in trade. The holiday
J observances cut into business by reducing the attendance on the
exchanges and curtailing the wholesale and jobbing movement.
Christmas week is never very brisk in a wholesale way, as it is
given over almost exclusively'to the retailers. â¢ ' â¢ ,"'-/â ;
The holiday demand was expected to be good, but it has ex
ceeded expectations, taking the country as a whole. The liberal
Christmas purchases of the general public testify to the continued
prosperity of the nation. Prices for luxuries were higher than the
normal, but the public purchased just the same, and the bargain
counters were not as conspicuous as they used to be.
The staples showed no changes worthy of especial comment.
Wool was strong, with the raw product well cleaned up and in good
demand, and it is said that one-third of the 1905 clip has already
been Â«old in advance. The market for hides and leather continues in
good condition, the demand being still active and prices steady as
a rule. Iron and steel continue to send in excellent reports, which
indicate that the movement in both continues to expand, while both
crude and finished products show an advancing tendency.
Provisions show no particular change, but it is noticeable that
while the Western packers express themselves as opposed to much
of an advance at present they support the market on any marked
recessions. Lumber is steady and building operations continue
active. Railway traffic returns are favorable and ( show a steady in
crease, those thus far in December being 7.6 per cent above those
of the corresponding period last year. The foreign commerce exhibit
is also satisfactory, the returns for the port of New York showing
increased exports and imports over 1903.
The general distributive trade of the country, as indicated by
the bank clearings, shows a gain over last year of 29.2 per cent, and
of the first twenty-five cities on the list New Orleans is the only one
exhibiting a decrease. But this is probably due to the fluctuation
in cotton dealings there and hence does not really indicate any de
crease in actual 'business.' The failures for the week were 249,
against 239 for the corresponding week last year.
The feeling of optimism in Wall street will not down. All
financial interests express complete confidence in another lively year,
and while there is a bear element, as is always the case, it is in a
hopeless minority. All attempts to permanently break the stock
market signally fail. If the market breaks it immediately rallies,
showing the general feeling of confidence pervading the investing
interests.
The leading factors at present are the phenomenal abundance
of money, the excellent demand for all standard securities and the
promising business outlook. The large demand for bonds is illus
trated by the recent heavy offerings of new issues, which have
reached a total of about $200,000,000 in New York during the past
two months. The most important of these are the $30,000,000 in
Japanese bonds, S25.000.000 in New York bonds, $25,000,000 Rock
Inland. S40.000.000 Mexican and a number of smaller issues. In ad
dition the Atchison and Missouri Pacific each proposes an issue of
S50.000.000 in the near future. These railway issues are rendered
necessary by the current heavy demands upon the leading lines for
freight and passenger transportation, which is convincing testimony
to the current increase in railroad business. If trade were dull there
would be no such expansion in railroad traffic.
As mentioned last week the only reports of quietness in trade
come from some parts of the Pacific Coast ahd"the South. This is
explainable in our case by the fact that pretty much of our 1904
production has already passed out of first hands and been shipped
East and abroad, hence the condition is notreally adverse. Even as
it is our coast business has been increasing for the past six months,
as already pointed out, and the final returns for the year will prob
ably show that 1904 was a bettftr year even than 1903, excellent as
the latter was.
The rains of last week have dispelled any apprehensions as to the
condition of the crops, which at present promise an abundant pro
duction in 1905. As we are almost wholly dependent upon our crops
for our prosperity it will thus be seen that we are still in an era of
good times.
THE REGULATION OF FREIGHT RATES.
United States Steel Corporation has openly defied the
I power of the Interstate Commerce Commission by issuing a
circular order to all its constituent companies advising them to
ignore the recent ruling of the commission on the illegality of rate
division with industrial roads. To the end that by failing revenues
all the railroads may be forced to accede to the steel corporation's
demands, that organization has already announced its determination
to throw over to the lines of the only Western railroad refusing to
discontinue the illegal practice, the Wisconsin Central, all the pos
sible tonnage which can be routed over its system. In that way the
steel trust hopes to force the remaining railroads to a continuance of
practices which have fallen under the ban of the Interstate Com
merce Commission..
An interesting situation is thus developed by the action of the
United States Steel Corporation, and one which forces immediate
action if legislative attempts to nullify discrimination by the rail
roads in the matter of freight charges are to have" any measure of
success. In its recent report to Congress the commission calls at
tention to the fact that under the existing order the commission may
find that a rate complained against is in truth unreasonable, and it
may order the carrier to desist from charging that rate in the future,
but it cannot, by reason of the limitations of its powers, find and
order the reasonable rate to be substituted for the one adjudged ex
.cessive. As it is. any reduction from the original rate made by a
railroad at the behest of the commission, insufficient though it may
be. is in effect a technical compliance with the commission's orders
and frees the carrier from further legal obligation. Carriers may ig
nore the commission's orders altogether and await a trial of the
issue in a Circuit Court upon the initiative of that body. "
"The most important legislative act now needed," says Presi
dent Roosevelt in his last message to Congress, "as regards the regu
lation of corporations, is this act (the one recommended by the com
mission) to confer on the Interstate Commerce Commission the
power to revise rates and regulations, the revised rate to go at once
into effect and stay in effect unless and until the court of review re
verses it.'' Against this advised* legislative measure the corpora
tions make strenuous objection that the concentration of authority
such as that sought into the hands of five men would be dangerous to
their every interest, besides being an unwarranted usurpation of leg
islative authoritv.
The Federal regulation of interstate rates for common carriers
is not designed, however, to partake of a legislative or an execu
tive character. The proposed amendatory measures provide for a
complaint, a full hearing, a report and opinion, and an order â a pro
ceeding which is essentially judicial in character and effect. The
amendment sought by the commission but places a confirmation by
subsequent legislative action upon the powers given that body in
its corporative act of 1887. Thes*e powers were exercised in the
spirit of the law creating the commission until the Supreme Cotfvt
decreed in May. 1897, that no authorization for such prerogatives
â¢was embodied in the original creative act. ,

CONNECTION BETWEEN
LOVE AND FOOD AN
INTERESTING STUDY
By Dorothy Feotmore
THE close connection between
man's love and food is worthy of
R university monograph by a
specialist in domestic scence. Such a
work, if couched in noble language,
might revolutionize the higher educa
tion of woman by furnishing college
girls with mental pabulum' suited at
once to their intellectual needs and
their feminine aspirations.
To-day man is either less ethereal
or more ingenuous than Shakespeare
was, or Milton; he does not look upon
music or smiles as adequate food for
the affections. Dickens showed deep
insight it-.to the nature of his sex when
he made chops and tomato sauce an
important argument in a breach of
promise suit. And Dr. Andrew Wilson
exploded one favorite illusion of
youthful lovers about the cheap sim
plicity of love's dietary by declaring
that bread and cheese, while a good
enough meal for a farm laborer, would
prove indigestible to a city man. He
does not even hint that a modicum of
kisses would do the service of pepsin.
Good coking, it is generally agreed,
is the logical basis of domestic hap
piness 'Tis the married man's crite
rion of wifely ability. It is the bache
lor's dream of a happy home. The
easy chair and. a pair of slippers at a
cheerful fireside are out of date as a
lover's inspiration. The gas stove ha<Â»
come into fashion in their place. Nor
can the mandolin and light guitar
compare with the chafing dish as mys
tic spells to lure the masculine fancy.
No longer do women, like sirens on
the rock.", attract the heart of man by
songs. Like Hebe, rather, they charm
Olympus by the more substantial
magic of nectar and ambrosia.
Even women's clubs have taken the
matter up. In solmen convocation not
vf-ry long ago the Social Economics
Club of Illinois gave the cook stove
the place o.f honor among the three
essentials of a home. And an asso^
elation of young society ladies has
been formed in a fashionable suburb
of Philadelphia to learn the double
art of winning a husband and retain
ing his affections. ; "Feed him substan
tially" is the motto which they are
embroidering in golden thread on the
perforated cardboard of their maiden
dream?, with a view of using this wis
dom as a household adornment, just as
belore them their grandmothers
framed "Home, Sweet Home," to hang
over the mantelpiece.
Hetty Green, who has the reputation
of possessing the wisdom of the ser
pent, puts upon the poor housekeep
ing of the American woman full blame
for the prevalance of divorce. If she
is right â and. since I would not dare
to contradict her to her determined
face, I will not do so behind her equal
ly determined back â if our girls were
taught how to cook, the number of di
vorces In the United States, which the
last census estimated as 51,538, would
be. noticeably decreased. Possibly,
with this reform in the education of
American women, the bald-headed
eagle would in time come to be the
symbol of domestic as well as national
unity. m
Man's position in regard to the rela
tive importance of love and food is
not different to-day from what It was
in earlier eras. King Soloman's cry
was: "Stay me with flagons, comfort
me with apples, for I am sick of love."
Wordsworth put into gastronimic
terms his description of a feminine
phantom ot delight â
'â A creaf-Ve not too brlrht and rood
For human nature's dully food.
Some of you may remember Lord
Cholmondeley's lovesick wail of woe,
as it sounded to the lips of Sothern:
"Cahn't eat, cahn't sleep, cahn't
smoke." Certainly Owen Meredith,
that Myrtle Reed of a former genera
tion, was right in declaring that the
great imperative masculine nee<f isâ
food.
MR. CHADWICK'S CHECK
A man went to Bellevue Hospital last
\seek and announced thai he wanted
to see Acting- Superintendent Rickard
in a hurry on business. Y> hen he was
ushered into Mr. Rickard's private of
hee he exclaimed:
"Want any money?"
"Not Just now," said Rickard. "I've
just had my salary raised."
Then the visitor leaned way over and
whispered: "I'm Mr. Chadwick.
You've probably heard about my wife.
Here's a little something to tide you
over the winter."
Superintendent Rickard accepted a
piece of paper the man offered him and
found that ijrwas a check for $2,000,000,
000 on the Fifth National Bank, at
Twenty-third street and Third avenue.
He didn't lose any time in calling to a
policeman to escort the man over to
the psychopathic ward.
There the man was positive that hi?
name was Chadwick, until the doctors
rr.ade him own up that he was Rudolph
1-ung, a butcher of 553 East One Hun
dred and Thirty-sixth street.â New-

And makes the nose and eyes grow. red
And makes a man, wish he were, dead?

And runs up mighty doctors' bills?

church at P.rewster, ,N. Y. They we're
from Waterb'ury . and . wanted to get

with: "You may stop right there for

ADVICE TO YOUNG MEN.
We hear much about forging to the
front, taking time by the forelock,
seizing the bull by the horns,, and the
like, and also that the man wilh the
tail-hold is entirely ignored. Nine men
out of ten wisely follow, and succeed,
where one docs who charges around at
the front all the time. If you miss the
forelock, seize the tail. It is the hang
ing on more than the particular hold
that counts. The man will go Just as
fatt and nearly as far who has hold
of the tail as the one hanging onto the
horn; besides, he can hold on better,
and is in less danger. Young man,
don't be too anxious to get rapidly to
the front, but hang on to what you
have, and you will get ahead in the
world just as fast as you deserve.â

WIDOW MORIARTY'S GOAT
The Widow Moriarty erf Melrose until
Thursday had a pet goat, which was
the idol of her heart, says the Susque
hanna, Pa., correspondent of the New
York World. ' She had nothing else
upon which to lavish her great wealth
of affection. When asked by her
neighbors why she didn't marry, the
widow would invariably reply; "Sure,
an* Billy' is company enough, and he
don't smoke or drink, nor swear, and
he don't stay out nights."
; And the aromatic goat appeared to
enjoy the, affection, showered upon
him, and as he ambled along the Jef
ferson branch tracks, picking up" stray
door, scrapers, railroad, spikes and
couch springs, no happier animal
could be found. In an evil, moment
he found, a railroad torpedo and swal^

TEXAS COURT WILL
DECIDE THE YALUE
OF THE APPENDIX
HJ TOW now! What Is the value
I â I In the cold coin of the realm
A a of the vermiform appendix?
The courts must determine,"
j said the man. "and thereby hangs a
j tale of scientific meddling^ which may
i impose, in the end, a heavy penalty on
j men who have been trying to overthrow
I the old order of things. Out in Texas
! a suit has been instituted against a
j physician who operated for appendi
! citis-. The patient lost his vermiform
appendix in the operation and. recov
eripg. now alleges that he never had
'appendicitis; that the operation was
i unnecessary.' in fact, a surgical blon
der, and in a suit for damages seeks to
recover $900. which he fixed as the value
of tht aforesaid appendix. Was it
worth that amount? What is the value
of the vermiform appendix? These
questions must be answered by the
court in which the suit has been!
.brought, and no doubt the world will
be vastly enlightened by this judicial
inquiry. Up to recent years we never ;
knew we had a vermiform appendix. \
It was one of those curious things the
existence of 'which nature had care
fully concealed from' us until some
meddling scientist came alone: and |
save the thing away. Since that unholy !
hour we have been sorely troubled by j
the newly discovered member, Â«.nd we ;
have been paying out large, sums in j
physicians' fees and enduring an end- |
less amount of torture because we sud- ;
denly found out that we had a vermi- j
form appendix. Before we made. this,
discovery we suffered from an ailment \
which was not called by the high- \
sounding and dignified name of appen- !
dicitia. Of course, I know nothing of
the merits of the Texas case. But it .
will serve a good purpose if the inquiry I
throus more light on the function and
value of the vermiform appendix. Dif- !
ferent theories have been advanced as J
to the function of the â¢ appendix, one i
theory being that it is merely a rudi- !
ment which was perhaps of value in
some earlier stage of man's develop- 1
mer.t, but which ts of no value to man
in his present state. The Texas Inquiry ',
should settle this and other questions â

MANNERS AT WEDDINGS
Many a* prospective bride and groom
of to-day make plans for the ap
proaching wedding with as much se
crecy as if they were stealing chick
ens, says the Syracuse Post-Standard.
They long to slip into some little
church or parsonage "around the cor
ner" and have the knot tied with no
one but the#nselves and the minister
the wiser. They await the inevitable
hour with fear and trembling. What
is the reason for this? It is* the.fore
boding spectacle of the barbarism, ex
pression in foolish, clownish pranks,
played by "humorous friends," that
will follow the ceremony. Unless the
groom is shrewd enough to outwit the
tormentors, a difficult task, the cou
ple will be certain to be. humiliated
in many ways before the eyes of
amused strangers.

PARENTAL SCHOOL
IS A SUCCESS
I Superintendent Langdon's Report to Board of
Education Tells Its Own Tale.
â¢ BY LAURA BRIDE .POWERS.
i If there's anything nearer the hearts
I of San Francisco clubwomen than the
j Juvenile Court and Its precious ally, the
I Parental School (which in turn is the
j ally r-f the compulsory education law),
; I haven't met it- It was in the Calif or-
I nia Club, durirg Mrs. George Law
\ Smiths administration, that the seeds
1 of the great . humanitarian movement
; were sown. Carefully was the plant
nurtured In the nursery pf the club
until some good Samaritans, ~FaIrfax
I Wtoetlan, Judge sMoes, Judge Murasky
i and other unattached goc-d people ral
i lied to the support of the work in hand,
j and laws were enacted at the last Leg
islature making provision for Juvenile
in certain localities.
Then cameâ in its own good time, as
come most reforms â the Parental
School of San Francisco. It was found
ed in this city, experimentally, to han
dle boys that had overrun school and
parental discipline. Schools of this
type had been in puccessful operation
in the large cities of the East for some
years, but in the West the proposition
was a new one.
The fundamental basis of success
was to secure for the school a head who
wc-uld understand the mental mechan
isms of boys â the psychology of lads
who compose "de gangs" that infest
the densely populous parts of the city.
The Board of Education found in Rich
ard K. Faulkner, for twenty years prin
cipal of the Franklin Grammar School,
at Eighth and Harrison streets, the
leader needed. What he, abetted by
Superintendent Langdon and the Board
of Education, has done during the year
is best told in the following report sub
mitted by Mr. Langdon to the board on
Thursday last:
Gentlemen: I submit herewith a report on
the Ban Francisco Parental School organized
by this Board of Kducation July 27, 1904.
While there Is yet much to be deeired In tha
equipment and organization at the school and
in its environment a fair start has been made.
Already the good results of a school of thlÂ»
kind In the city have been made evident by tha
decrease of truancy In tha regular schools.
The course of study as followed In the oth
er schools of the city is carried out herÂ« and
to addition thereto the superintendent has di
rected the principal and teachers to devote
special attention to manual training, physical
culture and military drill, music and drawing.
Joseph Meyers, formerly a drill sergeant in
the National Guard, and now superintendent of
th<Â» children's play ground, h&s volunteered his
services to lnÂ«truct the boys of thÂ« Parental
School in military tactics, superintend their
physical training practice and direct their
games and sports at the public playground
during each noon hour. Already an improve
ment in \he physique and bearing of the boys
is noticeable. Frank Barthel. teacher of man
ual training in the Franklin School Center, has
kindly volunteered to give an hour's work in
manual training, after school hours; to the
Parental School boys. At the beginning of the
nest school year proper compensation should
be made to tbeso men.
At present there is no one In the Parental
School who can effectively supervise the music
and drawing. As these -subjects are especially
Important for boys of their type I respectfully
suggest that the next teacher assigned to the
school bÂ« qualified to supervise both thesa
ctudles for the entire school.
- On Monday. December 12. 1904; ths Honor
able Frank J. Murasky. Judge of the Juvenile
Court, and the Superintendent of the Schools,
acting upon the recommendation of the prin
cipal of the Parental School, paroled eight boys,
thrÂ«Â« of whom had been committed to the
school by the Juvenile Court and five throujh
ths superintendent's office. Seven of the boys
sÂ«em to flt Into regular school condition* satis
factorily and bid fair to give no further trouble.
One of the paroled boys played truant Im
mediately upon his return to a- regular school,
but was at once taken into custody and will
be disciplined by the Juvenile Court.
The present enrollment of the school aa
shown by the report of the principal. Is S3, thÂ«
rrades being represented from the first to the
sixth, inclusive. Thirty-one of ths boys in at
tendance at this school were committed to it
by the Juvenile Ccurt. the Judge of this court
and the Superintendent of Schools each having
the authority to send boys there.
In a word thÂ« school under tha direction oi
the faithful and efficient principal, Richard V
Faulkner, and its excellent and enthusiastic
corps of teachers may be deemed a decided
success and promises to become a means of
working out satisfactorily the compulsory edu
cation law.
Now, all thig is encouraging. It
stands for progress. It stands for the
first duty of government toward de
linquent childrenâ not only on the high
plane of duty, but of necessity.
Young lawbreakers become mature
criminals. Environment saves young
lawbreakers from developing into ma
ture criminals. Therefore let us extend
the environment for healthy develop
mentâmental and moralâ and the
means at hand for said growth consists
of the Parental School, the Detention
Home and the Juvenile Court, all col
laterals of . the compulsory education
law.
These potent factors of future good
citizenship are now conducted largely
from philanthropical contributions, the
women's clubs subscribing monthly to
the payment of probationary officers
that the work may be carried on.
Ye citizens of San Francisco who
were endowed at birth with the right to
vote pray remember that that which
makes for good citizenship Is not a
matter for philanthropy. The budget
for municipal housekeeping comes up
before the Supervisors in the spring.
Voters and friends of voters prepare to
do good urging where it becomes neces
sary.
This great humane work should be
borne by the Government, which will in
a decade reap, its fruitsâ not by Indi
viduals nor organizations.

BUSY SEASON OVER
TOR OLD KRIS
These busy days have been almost ;
entirely devoted to the cause of 'merry
old Kris Kringle. "All is fish that
cometh to his net," and the tendency
has been to swim, in hi3 direction. A
few partles.'club and home affairs have
intervened; Cupid ia really hibernating,
but waitâ he is gathering : force and
after another fortnight have a care,
for the sly culprit's quiver is rapidly
. 'engagements.'. , .
A reception was â  held Sunday.
December IS, at the residence of IMr.
and Mrs. LV Harris, 625 Ndtorna street,
in \ honor of the engagement "of ; their
daughter. Miss Rose Harris, and Harry
be held on the third Monday in Jan
uary.

\ Last Tuesday the California Club had
a bird day, Â«*)nd as merry a day as a
bird day ; <>ushl to be. The' programme
was devoted to birds ard bird day in
the schools. It was in charge of* the
club's department of . education, of
which Mnie. Emilia TojÂ«tti is the clever
chairman. A general invitation had
been extended to the teachefs? of San
Francisco to attend this meeting of the
club.
Miss Bertha Chapman save an inter
esting lecture on -Our Birds and the
N'eeds of Protective Legislation." She
used many bird skins to illustrate her
remarks. Miss Chapman. ' who has
charge of the nature study course in
the Oakland school, held the attention
of all the women present for nearly an
hour. She quoted marvelous statistics
proving that birds are of enormous
benefit to the farmers, as they destroy
the farmer's enemies, the Injurious in
sects and the seeds of noxious weeds.
She hopes that the boys who are now
in school may be taught the economic
value of birds, and that the next gen
eration of farmers will recognize them
as their best friends. Of eighty spe
cies of hawks only six are bad. and
through ignorance all hawks are called
bad. which is rather hard on the well
behaved hawks.
Two bulletins are about to be issued
by the Department of Agriculture In
Washington in regard to the food of
California birds, and investigations will
be continued next year in this State
by the same branch of the Govern
ment.
Mrs. Dean W. Park, the second
speaker, made a plea for an annual
bird day in the schools of California.
She quoted from official circulars of
the Department of Agriculture an ap
peal issued eight years ago to all thÂ»
schools of this country 'to set apart
such a day in the spring 1 of each year,
and teach the boys not to shoot blrd3
nor to collect eggs, and the girfs not
to wear feathers on their hats. She
gave a brief account of the work done
by the "bird-stomach man," so called,
in Identifying the insects and seeds
found in the crops of thirty-four thou
sand birds shot for the purpose, and
the overwhelming testimony in favor
of protecting birds.
Mrs. Park appealed to teachers and
club women to abandon plumage of all
kinds, except ostrich feathers. A large
amount of bird literature was distrib
uted among the club women.
Two Audubon societies have been
formed recently In this State, one in
Pasadena of 600 members and the new
one at Berkeley. The State Federation
of Clubs which meets at Los Angeles
In February will probably have bird
protection on its. programme.
Ah! But that's an awful wrench-
Just after every woman nas ordered
home her new' winter hat, and, of
course. It has a wing or a breast.. or an
aigrette on it. If it hasn't it lacks dis
tinction. Alas! Another, clash of theory
and practice, of. % fiction and reality.
However, after a few more bird days,
with such clever missionaries as Mrs.
Paul and Miss Chapman, we women
may so alter our tastes as to eschew
the glistening raven wine or the pea
cock's gaudy breast.
By the way, now that humanitarian
appeals are being made to women to
save birds by not buying their poor
Jittle dead bodies for millineryâ which
is, of course, a barbarous practice,
since it would be as sane to use fish
for the purpose^ â why doesn't some
voice cry out against the unspeakable
crime committed -for the purpose of
clothing some woman in broadtail?
Shame should kill the infamous traffic,
and I am of the belief that if women
knew that a dozen unborn lambs had
been slaughtered that their half-grown
skins could be used for a single coat oÂ£
fashion they wouldn't) want to wear
them- And with the vanishing of de
mand the little lambs would live to
fulfill the laws of life.
Let the clubs agitate the matter.
To-morrow at 12:20 tha California
Club will "set Itself down to breakfast
in the Pioneer Hall. "No speeches, no
papers, no bores" is the watchword.
The breakfast ought to be a ravishing
success.
The Susan B. Anthony Club met Mon
day, December 19, at 2 p. m., at the res
idence of Mrs. Ellen A. Sargent, 1690

ARROW MAKES
AN AERIAL TRIP
Baldwin's Airship Travels
Twenty Miles in a Flight
Over City of Los Angeles
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 25.â Captain
Baldwin's airship, "California Arrow,"
driven by Roy Knabenshue. who made
several successful flights in the same
machine from the World's Fair grounds
at St. Louis, was given its ' first trial
in California to-day and was entirely
successful, with the single exception
o* its failure to land at the starting
point. A landing was effected half a
mile away without damage to the ma
chine, and it was safely towed back to
its anchorage.
The Arrow started from Chutes Park
baseball grounds, in the southeastern
part of the city, at S:17 p. m,, sailed
v.ith the wind northeastward for a dis
tance of between eight and ten miles,
thence eastward for two miles and re
turned in the face of a twelve-mile
gale to a point directly above the start
ing place, but. owing to the supply of
gasoline running short, was unable to
effect a landing at exactly the desired
spot.
From the time the airship arose from
the baseball grounds until it w"as safe
ly anchored â  at Pico â  and Stanford
streets, it was in fltght.an hour and
thirteen minutes, and in that time
sailed a distance, of probablf twenty
miles. "When flying with the wind the
Arrow traveled at a speed of twenty
miles an hour, and in returning directly
in the face of the strong: southeastern
gale was able to make a rate of speed
reckoned at between six and eight
miles an hour.

TREMENDOUS WAVE HITS
STEAMER G. W. ELDER
Vessel Is Deluged With Water
MANY CABINS ARE FLOODED
The steamship George W. Elder,
which arrived In port yesterday, en
countered a terrible storm on her trip
down the coast from the Columbia
River. In the fury of the gale she was
struck by a terrific wave, which dashed
over her smokestack and almost sub
merged her. In all her many hundreds
of voyages during her last twenty-flve
years' service on this coast she has
never had anything like so tempestu
ous a passage.
She left Astoria on Friday morning.
The Columbia River bar v/as breaking
badly, and was a seething mass of tur
bulent waters at the time the Elder
crossed out. She had only gone fairly
out to sea when' she ran into a heavy
southwest gale. While she is known
all the world over as a famous roller,
this storm Bhowed*up her qualities to
the limit. She was tossed right and
left by the high seas and the strong
wind. She rolled over so far that it al
most seemed she would never right
herself.
At 11 o'clock Saturday morning, when
the storm was at its height, a tremen
dous wave struck- the steamship with
great violence, washing completely
over her and throwing tons of water
on her decks. The vessel trembled in
every flber, and the shock was so great
that many of the passengers thought
she had struck a rock. Stateroom doors
on the starboard side, where the wave
struck, were torn, away, and windows
were smashed in. Every room on the
upper deck was flooded. One of the
passengers was severely cut on the
nose by fragments j of flying glass.
Crockery was thrown from the tables
and scattered in all directions.
Assistant Cook Mahoney was thrown
completely across the galley by the
force of the shock and thrown against
a camp chair. He landed on his left
side, with the result that his left hand
is now rendered useless. It is badly
swollen and he fears it will be a long
time before he will have the use of it.
Volumes of water poured through
the skylights and landed in torrents
upon the kitchen ranges. As soon as
the vessel righted herself, the occupants
of the flooded rooms were removed to
other portions of the ship/ while the
drenched contents, of the rooms were
removed and taken" out to be dried.
The storm kept up with great fury un
til the vessel was about forty miles off
the harbor. John McMullen, one of the
passengers, said he had been a sea
going man all his life, but he had never
encountered such a storm.
He said that out of the sixty-five
passengers on board but six managed
to scramble down to the dining saloon
for their meals. At the time the big
wave approached the ship he was look
ing out of his stateroom window. It
looked to him like a great tidal wave,
and was fully 70 feet high. As it tow
ered up over the ship it looked like a
mountain. The higher the wave went
up, the lower the ship seemed to go
down. Suddenly the water came crash-
Ing down with a.roar like thunder. It
buried the vessel from stem to stern
and caused her to' shake like an aspen
leaf. Had she , not been . of powerful
construction she would have gone to
the bottom.
She reached port yesterday morning
at 10:30. As soon as she came along
side the dock she was gayly decked
with flags and Christmas trees, while
her damaged belongings were hauled,
ashore and hung up to dry on the dock.
Xcko Arrives.
The German steamship Neko arrived in port
yesterday, 120 days from Hamburg and nine
and a half days from Champerico.
She brings a miscellaneous cargo, the prin
cipal Items of which are 2500 barrels of Port
land cement from Hamburg and 18.S61 bags of
nitrate of soda from Caleta Buena. She is
consigned to J. 1). Spreckels &. Bros.. Com
pany.
Following is a list of the passengers: Fr.
von Llndemann, Robert Karl. Mrs. M. Karl,
MUs Adele Karl. Mies Laura Karl, Robert
Karl Jr. and CM. Emerson.
(Captain Rickman verifies the report that he
sent from Valparaiso on October 19 to the ef
fect that on October 12 he sighted a dfsman
tled steamer abandoned and partly submerged
In latitude 48 degrees south and Â«4 degrees
west. He said he believed the derelict to be
a danger to navigation.
Valuable Cargo of Furs.
The steamship Harold t>ol!ar arrived In port
yesterday with a cargo of furs of great value.
Amon* the lot were 8300 sealskins, 67 sea
otter skins and a miscellaneous assortment of
rare sable, bear and fox skins. She Is con
s!.Tied to Roth, Blum & Co. She was four
teen and a half days from Petropavlovski. via
Bertn~ Sea and Copper Islands. Captain
M H. Thwlng reports that on December 20
the steamer lost a blade of her propeller.
Tjoscs Anchor and Chain.

chor and twenty fathoms of her chain on Sat
urday night. She was lying off Melggs wharf,

Extending Use of Aluminum.
According to La Metallurgie, at a re
cqnt meetins of the. Socitie d'Encour
agement pour l'lndustrle. National, an
interesting paper was read on the sub
stitution of aluminum for wood in the
machinery of spinning mills. , In the
textile " industriesâ spinning, "dyeing,
and silk weaving, among othersâ a
wooden bobbin is generally used. This
is cheap and easily worked, but it has
many drawbacks. Being very hygro
metric,' it suffers from variations 1 of
temperature; this accounts for the fact
that in spinning factories where the
atmosphere is full of humidity the bob
bins revolve irregularly, causing Jerks
which slacken the speed and occasion
the threads â¢ to break. â¢ The result Is
waste of. stuff and loss of time, in Join
ing the threads again. It has. _, been
proposed .to > substitute aluminum for
.wood.'-. Bobbins made of [this, metal re
volve In ' any : temperature , and any de
gree \ of humidity; ; their ; relative . light
ness (five aluminum bobbins' weigh no
more than' two .wooden ones) [ allows
the ' machines carylng , them to ? move
more < quickly, ; or; an equal ; speed ; may
be 'obtained at "less expense' of -motive
power; - finally, the smaller ; volume of
tfhe'' bobbins "diminishes ...the â¢ cost of
.transport. % It was stated- that â¢ several
firms had adopted the use of aluminum
bobbins ' and ; had \ found Uhat \ they pos
sessed j\ many ; ad vantages.â New?" York

"KILLED" AT LAST
AKTER 3IAXT ESCAPES
Officer Many Times Struck In Battle
Blet Fate in Recent
Maneuvers. ' "
Army officers are not given to cal
culating their chances on the field of
battle except In the most cold-blooded
way. They have figured out for
themselves the percentage of men who
lose their lives on the field of battle as
compared with the number of rounds of
ammunition expended, and they go
about war as a purely business propo
sition. There are, however, sometimes,
peculiar Instances noted In the lives of
some officers that give those who pin
faith to that mysterious. power called
"fate" excellent argument In favor of
their particular creed.
It happens that in an Infantry regi
ment now stationed at one of the posts
in New York State there is a popular
major who enjoys the distinction of
having been wounded in almost every
engagement in which he participated,
at some time during its course. Thts
officer Is known as one of the bravest
and coolest of men on the battlefield,
and his mettle has been proven in In
dian campaigns, in Cuba, the Philip
pines and China. He has been wounded
repeatedly, some officers claim more
than any other officer in the army, but
is still a good, healthy, active speci
men of the kind of men the United
States has in its army. This officer, of
course, was compelled to take a good
deal of chaffing when . he started for
the recent maneuvers in Virginia. His
brother officers declared that he would
not get a chance to be wounded In
this campaign, and made him the butt
of several jokes of this character. It
happened, however, that the battalion
commanded by this major was thrown
into the thick of the fight in the course
of the solution of the second problem,
and with his usual ability the major
managed to secure information which
would enable him to take his command
through the enemy's lines. He made
a reconnoissance of the ground over
which he expected to make this move
with his battalion and was returning
to give the necessary orders when his
luck overtook and threw him.' He was
just about to give his orders when a
polite and efficient umpire rode up to
him and Informed him, with the. utmost
care not to injure his feelings, that he
had been "killed!" Being "dead." Jie
could not take the battalion where he
had planned, but the officer next in
rank. a. lieutenant, had, fortunately, es
caped slaughter, and, being acquainted
with the plans of his chief up to a cer
tain point, marched the battalion for
ward on his own responsibility and
made the contemplated movement. So
successful was the maneuver that it
practically won the battle for the army
to which it was attached.â Exchange.
A bov has to be mighty stupid not
to have his mother believing he Is al
most a genius.

TAKING TROLLEY RIDES
IN COAL MINES
A New Diversion Which People Have
Taken To in the State of
Missouri.
The trolley has, been put to a new
use. Out in Missouri, where there are
many coal mines, one of the
amusements of people is to ride
through the black diamond caves In
electric cars.
Incandescent lights are strung along
the entire distance, the roofs are high
arid well supported, the air is clean and
dry and there is no more cause for ap
prehension than; in taking a trolley
ride about a large city.
Missourians insist that bo far as min
ing matters are concerned they are in
advance of most of the Eastern States.
Five or six years ago most of the mines
were nothing but holes in the ground,
timbered and shored, with two streaks
of rust leading into them and now and
then a gaunt mule leading a car out
of them.
Now there are dozens of mines in the
State and a woman in a white Swiss
gown could Journey through for miles
without getting so much as a soot
mark on the hem of her garment.
Two reasons exist for the change.
One is that the State Legislature
adopted careful laws governing the op
eration of mines, an/1, the other is' that
the mine operators have found it cheap
to use electricity.
Some of the mines employ electricity
for power in hauling everything. A
few use it on the main entries and still
use the mules on the cross -and side
entries. - , .-.â¢.
These lines are built on the same
principle as the ordinary trolley; with
the rod running upon & wire strung
along the roof. Besides the cars used
for carrying coal to the dump each
mine has a passenger car. in which the
men are taken to and from their work
and in which excursionists are taken
through the drifts.
Formerly one current of' air was
thought .sufficient to maintain life and
health. A means was discovered by
which the currents could be split and
one carried over the other- Now every
large mine haÂ» from twelve to fifteen
currents constantly circulating through
it and the air is nearly as pure as on
top. T^HB
Invention has yet been unable- to find
a substitute for the pick and shovel.
These are still in use.â New -York Sun.

"HILDIE'S" FORM
AT A DISCOUNT
Season's Premier Jockey
Experiences a Slump and
Rides but Few AVinners
FOSSIL IS A FAVOKITE
The Fresno Gelding Is Fan
cied by the Talent for
the Hollywood Handicap
Special Dispatch to The Call
LOS* ANGELES, Dec. 25.â While
there were several startling reversals
of form at Ascot Park during the week
none has caused so much talk as the
slump of Jockey Hildebrand.
This is all the more remarkable to the
sports, as Hildebrand ranks as the best
jockey in the country and he has not
been on bad horses here.
Since coming to Los Angeles he has
broken the world's record for winning
mounts in any one year. While he is
riding in his present indifferent man
ner he is a constant menace to the bet
ing men who cannot play his mounts
with an assurance of winning, and yet
cannot afford to pass him by on ac
count of what he can eo when he Is
right. He had twenty-seven mounts
during the week, finished first three
times, second four times, third six
times and was fourteen times outside
of the money and generally on favor
ites.
The first of the big stakes of the As
cot Park meeting will be run to-mor
row in the Hollywood Handicap at one
and one-sixteenth miles. Ten of the
class horses here are provable starters.
It is not likely any of them will be
scratched. Fossil, with 116 pounds, and
Nitrate, with 95, are the only ones in
the race that have not been racing at
AÂ£cot. Some of the wise ones pick-Fos
sil to win the stake- The track should
be in fine condition and fast.
EMIGRATIOX FROM STATE
TO FOREIGX COUNTRIES
Brazil Get* Greatest Xumber With
United States Xext Then
Areentlua.
Very much interesting : information
is contained in the recent annual re
port of Italy's Commissioner General
of Emigration. It is slated that as a
result of the great current of emlgra
ticn the Italian population abroad is
constantly increasing. A calculation
of the number of Italians living in for
eign countries was made by the Min
istry of Foreign Affairs in 18 81 and
Ifc91, and in 1901 a similar calculation
was made by the Commissioner Gen
eral of Immigration from a study of
the last general census of the popula
tion of the kingdom. It has been
ascertained that there were 1,032,392
Italians living abroad in 1881, 1,983,
206 in 1891 and 3,439,014 in 1901. Of
the latter number 654,000 were scat
tered * over Europe; 168,000 were" in
Airica. (Tunis, 83,000; Algeria, 39.000;
Egypt, 38,t)00); 745,000 were in North
America, 729,000 in the United States
and 11,000 in Canada), and 1,852,000
were in South America . (618,000 in
Argentina and 1,100.000 in Brazil). â¢
According to the Italian law the de
parture of Italian emigrants from for
eign ports is in general prohibited.
Exception has, however, been made in
the case of the French Compagnie
Generate Trans-Atlantique, which car
ries Italian emigrants from Havre to
New York, for the reason that every
year 12.000 to 14,000 emigrants go
from Northern Italy to New York,
who, paying the same passage money,
including railroad fare, save live or six
days in the trip to New York by sail
ing from Havre instead of Genoa.
In his report the Italian Commis
sioner General of Immigration states
that emigration is a; necessity for
Italy, and if it were not for this safety
valve, this possibility of finding occu
pation elsewhere, grave disorders
would occur against the public peace,
for the reason that existing territory
and capital in Italy are not sufficient
to give occupation to the mass of the
people. There is no doubt, he says,
that economic progress is being made
in Italy in agricultural as well' as in
the industriesâ in some parts of the
country, in other parts less. Any one
who can give good security can always
find credit. Nevertheless, it is evi
dent that the supply of hands exceeds
the demand. It is necessary that pro
gress along- certain mental and moral
lines keep pace with increase in capi
tal, in orOer that industrial expan
sion may take place, and since the
spirit of enterprise and association,
professional instruction and good faith
in commerce cannot easily be spread
impromptu, it is sometimes necessary
t > export labor. ;
The Commissioner General's report
further states that from September,
1901. to March. . 1904. more than
162.000 emigrants left Italy for North
and South American ports with pre
paid tickets, that is. tickets received
from friends or relatives abroad. The
proportion of prepaid tickets Is one
quarter of the total number, and. in
the case of the Prince Line, for New
York, the proportion of prepaid tick
ets was nearly one-half the number of
tickets. â¢
The report records that the Banco
di Napoli. recognized by Italian law
as a suitable depository for emigrants'
money, bad. In 1903. established forty
four branches in the United States.
These banks received $1,436,252 of
such money in 1902 and $3,583,511 in
1903. â New York Commercial.

PEACE HOVERS
ABOUT NELSON
Fighter From Chicago and
His Boy 3Ianager Absorb
Spirit of Christ mastide
TO GO EAST TOGETHER
Dane Will Try Six-Round
Style \ of Competition on
the Atlantic Seaboard
The appearance of Manager Ted
Murphy on the scene seems to have
cooled Battling Nelson's ardor for re
venge. Peace is seemingly restored
once again and it looks as though the
pair will say good-by to San Francisco
and make a getaway to the windy city
of Chicago as soon as the legai part
of. the business can be arranged. .As
Kelson seems satisfied with the present
state of affairs there is every reason
to believe everything will be. quietly
adjusted.
Nelson has evidently been burdened
with too many advisers and incidental
ly has been having too good a time
along the line. He has at last come
to a realization of just how he stands
and will probably take Murphy's ad
vice and forsake the primrose path and
its gay charmers. Nelson and Murphy
partook of their Christinas dinner to
gether last night and this helped in a
great measure to bridge the yawning
gap that for a while made it look bad
for the boy manager.
The name of William A. Pierce, the
widely known sporting writer of Bos
ton, has been mentioned in connection
with Nelson as a possible successor to
Murphy as manager. The Dane says
he has never been approached by either
Pierce or by his friends in this particu
lar. Pierce says he is too high-priced
a manager for Nelson and never
thought of succeeding Murphy in di
recting the affairs of the man from
Heprewisch.
Nelson is anxious to try his mettle
irÂ« some six-round bouts on the Atlantic
seaboard. He draws the line at
Yanger, Mowatt and others who scoffed
at him a year ago. They are anxious
now to have a chance at the loser's
end with him, as he is a drawing card.
JOHXSOX AND HART MAY MEET,
Greggains Is Also Thinking: About
.Matthias: Attell anil Hyland.
Manager Alex Greggains of the San
Francisco Club is still In a quandary
about the men he will match to box in
January. It now looks as thqugh Jack
Johnson and Marvin Hart will be the
principals, though as yet Greggains
has not made up his mind. Both men
express themselves as, being willing,
but Greggains has not satisfied himself
as to how the pair will draw.
A match between Monte Attell and
Dick Hyland is also in view. Attell has
been doing some good work in the East
and Greggains thinks he will draw well
here, being a native .son. If the latter
pair is signed ,up, Greggains will also
bring Tommy Burns arid Dave Barry
together, thus making a double main
event for his show.
Sam Berger and "Twin" Sullivan
boxed four fast rounds at gheehan's
yesterday in the presence of a big crowd
of onlookers. Berger showed himself In
perfect form and surprised Sullivan
with his ability to block, duck and
counter. After the bout Sullivan pat
ted Berger on the' back and said he
would do.
FILIPINO -PEACE. OFFICERS
MAKE QUITE AN ARMY
Former Governor Taft Sees Peril
in^So Large an .Anned '
Korce.
The native constabulary in the Phil
ippines,' 6000 strong, which, together
with the native scouts, the United
States troops and the municipal police,
must maintain peace, in the islands, is
a .subject of distrust in certain quar
ters. There are complaints that the
Government is educating a lot of dan
gerous^ irresponsible natives to fight
against it should another revolution
occur. These critics find ground for
their apprehension in a recent .mutiny,
and also in the fact that many of the
privates were in . the army of Agui
naldo, and that after serving terms- of
two years and learning all there Is to
know they decline to re-enlist. .
It is true there was a mutiny,
or rather desertion, in the constabu
lary forces in Northern Luzon last
February. Ricarte, captain general
and supreme dictator of the democratic
republic of the Philippines,; whose
headquarters are in the bush, managed
to get into communication with a cor
poral and six men in charge of one of
the constabulary posts in the \ moun
tains. By appealing to their vanity
and craze for titles he persuaded them
to desert their posts and become â ma
jor: generals and brigadier generals In
his phantom army.
The Filipinos arc always dramatic,
and this corporal and si* men deserted
with as much ceremony, as might at
tend the organization- of an empire.
They were almost immediately-cap
tured, however. Two of them have
been sentenced to death, and cthe, : Test
i have gone to the penitentiary 'for. life.
These severe penalties were considered
not only , expedient, but necessary for
moral effect upon the remainder of the
corps, and to convince alF.whom it
might concern of the folly and :l danger
of trifling with the sovereignty, of the
United States.
This is the only instance in which
the ' constabulary have proved faith
less, and it Is known that they j have
been tempted many times. v
I In addition to the constabulary, there
is a corps of 5000 native scouts,* under
the direct command of the. fmilitary,
and the ordinary municipal / police
force*, which throughout the islands
aggregates ten; captains, 171" lieuten
ants, 6S8 sergeants, 1181 corporals: and
7873 ; privatesâ a grand total * of 9925
men. Thus, altogether, there are ln ; tho
neighborhood of ,20,000 . natives' '.under
arms for the purpose of preserving
peace and . order, and ; about . th<Â» . same
number of regular American, troops. â <
v Former Governor Taft, in his final re
port; alluded; indirectly to the appre
hensions that have been frequently ut
terod concerning the- peril.: of drilllne
and arming so many, natives,^ for they
alone would make \ a \ formidable force
Incase of another revolution. f '-- '

EIGHT TENNIS PLAYERS REMAIN
IN DOUBLES TOURNAMENT.
Competition Proyes a Marked Success
â  on Courts of tlie California CM)
To Be Concluded This Afternoon
The scratch doubles tennis tourna
ment played on the California Club
tennis courts yesterday proved a mark
ed success and was thoroughly enjoyed
by the contestants. In most instances
a good and a poor player drew together,
so.no team of the fourteen entered out
classed the rest. At- the call of time
late in the afternoon four teams were
left in the competition. They are Ray
Splivalo and Chester Smith, Harry
Rolfe and Paul Jones. Bradley Wallace
and Frank Mitchell, and George Janes
and Melville Long. â¢ The survivors will
meet to-day in the semi-finals.
Most of the matches were won hand
ily, only two requiring the full three
sets. By far the closest match of the
day occurred in the first round when
Paul Jones and Harry 1 Rolfe met and
defeated Dr. Younger and Grant Smith.
The latter won the first set as they
pleased and looked like sure winners..
In the second s/t they were constantly
aheaQ. until their opponents won by an
8-6 score. In the third set Younger and
Smith led at 4-2, but Rolfe and Janes
fought hard and put up a good up-hill
game. They took this set by a 7-5
score.
The preliminary round match be
tween Bradley Wallace and Frank
Mitchell and Spencer Grant and George
Cutter was also close. Cutter and
Evangelists in the Orient
We all know that, evangelists are
honest, well-meaning people, and we
respect them accordingly. They seri
ously believe that they serve the Savior
by invading the ancient civilizations of
Asia and endeavoring to persuade them
of their error. The notorious fact that
they have never yet "converted" a
single Buddhist or Mohammedan or
Confucian of fair intelligence and res
pectable position means much to the
philosophical observer, but . does not
disturb the unconquerable enthusiasm
of the missionaries. The fact remains,
nevertheless, that neither in India, nov
Asia, nor China, nor Japan hag our
theology made the slightest genuine
progress since the first launching of J)he
propaganda. That missionaries havk
caused trouble, aroused bitter animosi
ties and frequently ushered in a reac
tion to the worst forms of barbarism
is undeniable. But that they have
saved a soul, in my proper meaning of
the phrase, has never yet been proven.

Mistake of a Western Surgeon.
Clarence Douglass of Musgokee is
poking fun at at Clark Moore's radium
water and tells this story: Recently
a patient, while shaving himself, sliced
off the end of his nose, and very natur
ally dropped the razor, which in fall
ing cut off one of his big toes. A local
surgeon bandaged him- up, but in the
excitement of the moment bound the
end of the toe to the nose wound, and
put the nose where the toe ought to
be. The mistake was not .discovered
for three days, when the bandages were
removed, and by that time, thanks to
the wonderful curative powers of the
radium water, perfect union had taken
place and both wounds were found to
be completely healed. The only incon
venience the patient now experiences

Deserted by her husband, leftwith

Vith Christmas good cheer. Mrs. Eliz
abeth Brlttson, a nurse, who lives at
Â«<56 Minna street, yesterday decided
that her troubles were greater than
she could bear, and in a fit of
despondency swallowed poison.
Before doing so she wrote a short
note bequeathing to her landlady, Mrs.
X^ouise Gonyea, her clothing and her
few remaining trinkets.
By chance the landlady went to her
lodger's room and discovered her ap
parently dying. An ambulance was
hastily summoned and the unfortun
ate woman was taken to the Central
Emergency Hospital, where, after
hard work by the surgeons, she was
â¢pronounced out of danger.
Mrs. Brittson refused to say what
poison she had taken, but added that
she was despondent and heartsick and
that nobody in the world loved her or
aeemed to care if she lived or died.
It is believed the woman has a step

Eureka Benevolent Associa

Condition of Jewish Poor
SOCIETY JS -GB0WING
Organization's Membership
and Funds on Hand Show
an Encouraging Increase
The boaVd of trustees of the Eu
reka Benevolent Association for amel
iorating- the condition of the Jewish
poor held its annual meeting yes
terday morning at 436 O'Farrell
street, and the reports of the various
officers for the past year showed that
the association had been very success
ful.
Besides the regular business of the
meeting, the following officers were
elected to guide the work of the as
sociation for the coming year: Presi
dent, Charles Hirsch; vice president,
S. W. Heller; treasurer, Albert Mey
er; secretary, Meyer H. Levy, .. and
trustees. Simon Anspacher, Herman
L,evy, Simon Newman, Slg. Schwa
backer, Henry Sinsheimer and Isaac
Strasburger.
The following is in substance the re
port of the president on the work of
the Eureka Benevolent Association
for thÂ« vear: .
The question of finance being paAmount
above all others, a glance at our income and
expenditures for the past year will afford the
necessary Information as to what our prin
cipal needs are. The Income of the general
fund for the fiscal year juet closed amounted
to S20.243 '2ti. an increase of $6033 9-i over that
of the previous year.
Our expenditures have been for charity
?19,o7i 55 and sundry expenses $2782 82. We
have been called upon for an Increased ex
penditure for charity of $2545 05 more than
for the previous year, which has caused a
deficit from the general fund of the sum of
11325 OS. This is by far the smallest deficit
that we have had for quite a number of years,
principally due to the fact that our receipts
from donations and bequeats for the year Just
closed have bÂ«en unprecedently large.
The income for the widow and orphan fund
amounted t o $0135 46. The expenditures have
been on account of dispensations to widows
and orphans $4575 and expenses $1019 11, a
total expenditure of $0494 11/ making a gain
of $2641 35. * - , .
Legacies and donations received from friends
and benefactors amounted to $12,"S2 4t$. Of
this amount $11,202 47 was apportioned to
the general fund and $157U 09 to the widow
and orphan fund, and suitable Inscriptions
placed on our memorial tablets In memory of
those deceased benefactors.
In accordance with the report submitted by
the committee on the revision of the consti
tution and by-laws, which had been submitted
to our members at our last annual meeting as
per resolution passed at said annual meeting.
a special meeting of the members was held on
February 7. 1904.* and tho amendments sub
mitted by them were adopted. Quite a num
ber of material changes were made, the prin
cfpal feature being the amendment to aug
ment the income of the general fund by with
drawing from the widow and orphan fund the
proportion from membership dues and dona
tions and bequests which had previously been
allotted it. This increased the income of the
general fund with the sum of $3040 25. and
were it not for this wise provision we would
have been forced to report a ' greater deficit
for the general â  fund than we have.
Strenuous efforts were made by the members
of your buard of trustees during the past year
to increase our list of members, and as the re
sult of their efforts I am pleased in being
able to Btate that they have Â»ucceeded in en
rolling *8 new names upon Our roiter. We,
however, lost 27 through death, resignations
and stricken from the roll, which leaves a net
gain of 21 members.
The following is a synopsis of- the
report of the secretary relative to the
financial showing of the association:
Income â Membership dues, $0438; Interest

Three Men .Figure in Bitter
Quarrel Over a Woman in

AEEESTS SOON FOLLOW
Fruit Man, Two Assailants
and Landlord Land in Jail,
but Female Goes Free
An ardent Greek woer, an irate hus
band looking for blood, two sympathiz
ing friends, a pair of able-bodied .po
licemen, a stern landlord and a win
some woman played leading roles in a
Larkln-street quarrel about 1 Oo'clock
last'' night. 'When the fracas terminat
ed all hands, with the exception of the
policemen and" the woman, were cele
bating the . merry Yuletide in small
and sparsely furnished rooms, with
bars as the leading decorations.
,The fight was pulled off in the fruit
store ' of bne Stomatis Polamis, at Ful
ton and Larkin streets, and within a
stone's throw of the City Hall police
station. The classic Greek was enter
taining the wife of Harry Quigg with
out the husband's sanction. News of
the little conference was brought to the
ears of Quigg and straightway he hur
ried to the scene, accompanied by his
friend, Harry, Lacris-
The two men entered the Greek's
place of business" without ceremony. In
a moment the battle was on. The at
mosphere was full of fists, flying fruit
boxes, cabbages^ oranges and sauer
kraut. The trio was still busy mixing
It at a lively gait, with Mrs. Quigg or
dering the men to break clean and re
frain from hitting in the clinches, when
Patrolmen Dwyer and Graham charged
on the scene of > action.
The. sight of the bluecoats was like
a flag of truce. The battle stopped be
fore the round was ended and the per
formers sought to make a hasty geta
way. Quigg and his friend hot-footed
to the Fulton House, a few doors away,
with the police coming fast in their
wake and gaining ground at each
stride.
The pursued managed to reach the
house in safety, and then the troubles
of W. W. Ackerman, the landlord, be
gan. According to the story of the offi
cers he refused to allow them to cross
his threshold. The debate lasted but
a few minutes, â  when the bluecoats
gained entrance and emerged a moment
later with ,the two fighters and the
stubborn landlord.
The former were locked up on
charges of battery and the latter was
held on a charge of resisting an officer.
The Greek was bundled into -the prison
a few.-. moments afterwards and a
charge of battery was registered
agrainst him.
The wdman was the only one lucky
enough to keep out of ; jail. She was
overlooked in the hurry and allowed
to go her way. Her duties as referee
were not contrary to law, and thus she
is allowed to Â«o free, while the men
who were, fighting- for her were all
taken to jail-

FRUIT DEALER
KILLS SAILOR
Alyiso Turchetti Fatally
Shoots a Man Known as
"George" on Barbary Coast
SAYS HE-WAS ATTACKED
Declares That the Victim,
With Four Others, Made
Attempt to Assault Him
Alviso Turchetti, a fruit dealer, fa
tally sfiot a sailor known as "George"
on Pacific street, near Kearny, last
night. The victim's surname could not
be ascertained by the police. .
According to three witnesses who
saw the shooting, Turchetti fired be
cause "George" bumped Into him acci
dentally. Turchetti maintains that he
and his brother, Salvlno, were assault
ed by five men, among whom was
"George."
. "He hit my brother," says Tur
chetti. "I thought it was a hold-up, so
I pulled my gun and fired."
"George" was taken to the Central
Emergency Hospital, but he was dead
when he arrived. The bullet entered
the left breast near the heart and the
sailor died on the way to the hospital.
He lost' consciousness the instant the
shot was fired.
Turchetti was arrested by Policeman
Shain and taken to the City Prison.
"When the sailor's death was reported
the prisoner was booked on a charge
of murder. He declares that he acted
in self-defense.
He and Salvlno Turchetti had Just
seen another brother, off to Keswick,
he says. As they were walking along
Pacific street, near Kearny, they were
assaulted by five men. Fearing that
they were being held up Turchetti fired.
This statement is contradicted by
three of the men who were with the
