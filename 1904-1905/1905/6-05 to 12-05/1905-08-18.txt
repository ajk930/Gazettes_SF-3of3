WASHINGTON. Aug. 17.â Most unique
of all money-making schemes which have
been recently excluded ; from j the ;< use ?of
the mails is the "Love Candy" enterprise
of tlie linn of Baker- & Smith of Detroit,
Mich., against which a fraud order was
issued by. the Postofnce Department, 1 to
day. Lee I*. Baker. and Henry G. Smith,
who are twenty and . twenty-two * years
old respectively, succeeded in working up
a considerable clientele of youths who
loved but were .not': loved -In return. *' It
seems that a*- letter -which fell into the
hands of the txjstal authorities caused
a brisk demand for their^confectlonery."
The. letter .contained some details "of
the potency of the love candy. A 1A 1 post
office inspector, had an' lnterview with: the
youthful members ; of ; the firm. , He. put
them through" the third degree, and,dur
ing the ordeal 'â. they admitted *. thatv-no
especial formula was i-equired : for the
manufacture of .'the love candy.".-

Luis Torres, commander of the Mexican
mllitarj' forces against the Yaqui Indians,
\u25a0who went to^ Torin, State .of Sonora,
about ten days ago, for the purpose of
meeting a delegation of chiefs and head
men of the tribe with the view of ar
ranging terms of peace, is said to have
accomplished his purpose. It is stated
here that the War Department ' has re
ceived advices from General Torres that
the preliminary articles of peace have
been signed by the Indian chiefs on be
half of the tribe and by him as the repre
sentative of the Mexican Government. â¢
General Torres was' authorized to offer
to the Indians, as a settlement of the war,
a large tract of land which forms a part
of the original possessions' held- by the
tribe situated In the rich valley of the
Yaqui Jllver. and to protect them in their
rights to the land for all time : to come.
The chiefs made a counter proposition
that not only the .land :In ."'question:-', be
ceded-' them but that all . of. the . Yaqui
prisoners of war now, being held \ by the
Government, including: -the several thou
sand men, women and children of the
tribe who \rere captured by soldiers and
exiled to remote parts of the republic,'
be given their full freedom and returned
to their horneT " ' - "
It is understood that this counter prop
osition was accepted by General Torres,
subject to the approval of President Diaz.
The war now about to be * brought ; to
a close has lasted for five years..

was obeyed with alacrity. The robber
called to the driver to throw the mail

ORDKRS DIUVUK TO HALT.
REDWOOD CITY, Aug. 17.-Or.c of thÂ»
most daring stage robberies in the his
tory of the State and one without parallel
in this part of the country occurred this
morning three miles from San Mateo and
about twenty "miles from, San Francisco.
The* stage which operates* between San
Mateo and Halfmoon Bay was baited by
a ''lone' highwayman on the steep grade
near the OrJ^tal Springs dam and, at the
point of a revolver, the driver of the
stage and the affrighted passenger*
were forced to deliver their personal
valuables and to throw into the road the
.sjtrong boxes of Wells-Fargo & Co., and a
commercial firm of Halfmoon Bay.^Hfl|
The robber won but little of value for
his desperate deed and fortunately no
one was Injured, although. the highway
man fired. three shots at a passing driver
of a team who unwittingly interrupted
the knight of the road in his work.
The affair has created intense excite
ment throughout the county and two well
organized posses, lead by Sheriff Mans
field of this , city, are scouring the \u25a0 hills
for * the ' bandit Wells-Fargo detectives
are* on, the Bcene, but as a very poor de
scription *of the robber v bas been obtained
from the occupants of the stage the pros
pect of an ear'x capture is not brilliant.
. - The \u25a0 stage . had left -.. San Mateo at an
early, hour and . had â gone as , far as tiia
Crystal ; , Sp rin?3 -.-dam, FSV*_ pitssengera
and the ' driver,"*, Edward Campbell, com
prised the party. . On the seat with tha
driver , was O. Olsen, a traveling man Â«m
pioyed "by Langley & .Michaels of San
Francisco. On v the Inside ". of the coach
were Miss A. Johnsan and J. C. Santos
of '. Halfmoon Bay : and Peter Julie and
Ralph Rooden of San Francisco. In the
care of the driver were the money box
of Wells-Fargo & Co. and a private box
ot Levy ; Brothers of Halfmoon Bay.

PROVO. Utah, Aug. IT.â Ray Daniels
of Proro, Utah, was the first name
drawn from the box at the drawing
for homesteads la the Uintah reserva
tion, which began here to-day. The
â¢eoond name drawn was Noah M. Bal
bock of Angora, Colo.
Daniels and Balbock will be en
titled to the first and second selections
respectively of the Uintah Indian res
ervation lands to be. thrown open to
entry on August 28. The values of
these homesteads of 160 acres each
have been variously estimated, but
conservative persons who have been
over the land place the values of any
one of the best fifty claims at $5000 to
910.000, and state that $10,000 Is prob
ably a liberal valuation of the best
claim open to entry as a homestead. ..
Fully 3000 persons were present to
day when the drawing began, under the
personal direction of W. A. Richards.
Commissioner of the General Land
Office. The 37,650 envelopes containing
the names of the persons who regis
tered earlier In the month at Grand
Junction. Colo., and Vernal. Price and
Provo, Utah, were placed in a great
revolving box and given a thorough
shaking up. The envelopes were drawn
from the box by three boys and the
names of the winners were announced
to the expectant crowd.
About 2000 names will be drawn to
day, and the drawing will continue Fri-
Cay and Saturday. The entering of the
land will begin August 28. when 111
entries will be received, and on each of
the two days following an equal num
ber of entries will be recorded.
Of the first two hundred persons
whose names were drawn to-day 110
are residents of Utah. SO are residents
of Colorado, and 9 are residents of
other States. The nine from other
States include the following: No. 36 â

. senting more â¢ than two hundred agricultural,

the following declaration of principles:
. "Whetefcs, The agricultural, manufacturing
ana- other indurtrles of this conntry have ex-
Dantied to such an extent that they can no
longer depend upon the home market for th*
consumption of their entire product ;and
Whereas, The export trade has become a
vital support to many of our industries: and
\u25a0\Vheregs, The present commercial attitude of
the United States, largely owing to our lallure
to carry, into- effect the reciprocity trade pro
visions of section IV of the Dtneley taw. is
antagonizing . foreign nations, whose good will
we defire. and on whom we have hitherto de
pended es purchasers of our surplus products 1 ;
therefore be it- ' â¢ \u25a0 - '
Resolved, first. That thla convention, recog
nizing the principle of protection as the . es
tabl-jshed policy ot our country, advocates re
ciprocal concession* by. means of a. dual or
maximum : and minimum tariff as the most
adequate and practical method of relieving the
etrained situation with which we are now con-,
fronted. Second, that the question 'of the
schedules and items to be co'neidered in Rich"
reciprocal concessions preferably be suggetsted
by a permanent tariff commission to-be created
by Congress and appointed jby the -President,
which shall consist of economic, industrial and
commercial experts. Third, that it i 9 the
sense of this convention tiiat our present tariff
affords abundant opportunity for such- con
cos&ions without inury -to industry, trade cr

DEFENDS HIS PARTY.
Kdward Rosewater, editor of the
Omaha PÂ»ee. was introduced. He said
he was secretary of the committee on
resolutions of the Republican conven
tion* of 1900 a:id wished to contradict
the statement made in the reciprocity
convention that the Republican party,
in its platform of 1900 and in 1904, had
pledged itpolf W a revision of the tariff
and that it had violated .its pledge. He
said: " â¢ . â¢ â¢\u25a0'.â¢. * ;,v>
The Republican pany*s greatest pledge was
a continuance of prosperity, and we have got
it.- tAppleuse.) sÂ»ow,.the question is, are we
at the crossing of the roads, or are we not on
the upward trend to the highest degree of pros
perity this country is. capable of having?
But remember there are methods of reaching
the Republican Congress mat must be pursued
t>y you here to-day or y*i are- not going to ac
complish very much. Tou cannot . accomplish
it by denouncing the -tariff . as a graft. There
is graft In church and there is graft,^ln Ma
pcnry and .other, organizations, but
you could not denounce the church and Ma
nonry because men have oeen found In i the
ranks who are \u25a0 grafters. There is graft, of
X'ourÃe, -In connection with the tariff, but as a
principle the protective system has built up
the Industries of the country, and It is because
of the great Invasion of great. American Indus
try to fell parts of the world that you have had
trouble which you 'are- called together to con-"
elder. Tou never would have been here but fbr
the fact that $1,600,000,000 ot American prod
ucts have foaun'l their way into foreign cou|i
trles within th<i past year. I believe In ; car
rying out th; letter and the spirit of the con
stitution, that reaches these questions fey- re- ,
ciprocity. I do not believe you can do it -by I
a double standard. That is precisely what you
propoee here, the double standard^ of tariff
which means simply a minimum tariff and
nothing else.
Governor Cummins â¢of lowa was the
next speaker. lie said in part:
I for one have a deep and abiding confidence
in the "judgment of the plain, common people,
and I want to settle this question In' the good,
old-fathioned way appointed by three institu
tions lor the determination of public policies.
Let us fight- It out before the people. If we
lose let us -abandon the attempt and if wÂ« win
let those who are skulking in the shadows of
concealment retire to the places that are ap-.
propriate fo.r coward* and "traitors to the poli
cies of our Government. "1 . believe upon all'
hands we must meet It in one or two ways â i.
retaliation- or reciprocity. The "standpatters" 1
bave ral*Â»d the banner of the former and we
march to tile music of the latter.
GEXERAL LAW NEEDED. ,
Many people think this- question is confined
to trea-tlea with particular powers, but It is
not so. for It can be accomplltned through
, general tarifto as well .as through special ar
rangements. Indeed, - It: can 'be - truthfully said
that with us, if attained in the near future.
It must be attained ' through v, general ; law by
*â¢ revision vi . our, schedule, - for' It has been
made clear to the dullest mind, i that . no , trade
treaty, however advantageous to the people ct
this cojntry,- can command two-thlrdi of the
United States Senate. It Involves . always, :
Invariably whether .attained . In the one way or.
the ether, some change. in our import duties,
and herÂ« the - trouble . begins. The - protective
tariff ' was . not originally Intended ' to r exclude
competition, but rather to create competition,
which echeduJes arranged with any lair/ re
gard for. this definition of- protection, reciproc
ity would already be secured, and retaliation
would be, th* weapon with which ' to punish
any country - which refused ' to ' deal ., fairly

. Our present - schedules . however, are \u25a0In the

It is only - when, through combination i orient*

the eminent jurist, "it would be her po

derstand that she had accepted the

because she was desirous of an honor
able peace," but because her. power .had
been annihilated and she recognized
that It was impossible for her; to con

A very important conference occurred
in Mr. Witte's rooms shortly before
midnight. There were present . Baron
de Rosen, the other Russian : plenipo
tentiary, and Mr, tie Maartens, General
Yermoleff. ; Mr. Pokotoliff. Mr. Shlpoff
and Captain Boussin, the five Russian
delegates. It is the first time a full
meeting of plenipotentiaries had been
held clnce the conference - began. - The
preliminary. discussion of the Japanese
conditions is already virtually. 1 ended.
It is not improbable that the final re
port and recommendations of the Rus
sian plenipotentiaries was passed \u25a0\u25a0'.- on
and transmitted to-night to the. Em
peror at Peterhoff. :
It can be stated that the individual
views of the members of the^' Russian
mission differ, as to what points bad been
yielded if a compromise is. to be* offered.
Some favor., the surrender, of Saghalien.
others an Indemnity. None are ready, to
give up both points. :s: s ;
China has a^J least constructively be
come a party to the .negotiations. Article
7, relating to the transfer to China, of
the branch: of the .Chinese Eastern Rail-
Viad. running south- from,, Harbin, which
,G*s agreed to. by the peace plenipoten
tiarie* "in principle," yesterday, involved
perhaps in the final settlement prolonged
and complicated -'negotiations*.' between
China and Japan and the Peking Govern-
The Japanese view wai explained.
"We came only asking what we
wanted. Our terms were moderate.
The world thinks so. It looks badly. I
say so: I believe so. But the confer
ence may yet be saved from shipwreck.
.Mr. 'Witte has been gracious. He has
S*ine what he can. but he has a future
f.t home to consider."
IMPORTANT MEETING.
"That I cannot say."
The only chance now is compromiseâ
Russia to yield Saghalien and Japan In
demnity. ! Neither will yield both, and
perhaps Japan at the final show of
hands will yield neither. Mr. Witte.
under the imperial instructions given
him before he left St. Petersburg, can
agree neither to pay war tribute nor
cede a foot of Russian soiL St. Peters
burg, therefore, in the last resort re
mains to be heard from. Doubtless* this
Is the reason why he favors a postpone
ment to-morrow over Sunday.
Baron Komura probably â¢will welcome
an adjournment of two days In order
that he also may lay the situation be
fore his Government before its final
decision. The sudden revival of deep
pessimism to-night was induced by the
j|"spatches given out when the pleni
potentiaries returned to the hotel, that
no progress had been made to-day.
But to those in the inside that was not
surprising! Things have gone smooth
ly enough only the impasse had been
reached â there had been the glint of
cold steel in jÂ£he conference chamber.
And the few words Mr. Witte said: to
the foreign newspaper correspondents
were, as usual, not encouraging. He
looked tired and said nothing had been
accomplished.
"To-morrow," he said, "will finish
, article* 11 and 12."
"What then?" he was asked.
"Then we will go to dinner," he re
plied as he excused himself to go, to
dinner with Assistant Secretary Peirce.
No very great hope was vouchsafed in
the Japanese camp.
~We are not bluffers," said Mr. Sato,
and from an authoritative source the
correspondent received a distinctly Dad
lxnpreseion regarding the outlook. It
was coupled.' however, with an expres
sion cf the hope that if It- developed
that the conference was going to
pieces President Roosevelt might again
ctep in.
"We have heard that the President,
having brought us together, has washed
his hands of further responsibility.
But , he is resourceful. He might" do
something."
â¢:whatr*
But the darkest hour is just before
the dawn and there is still hope. Pre
dictions of a final rupture to-morrow
certainly will not be justified unless
Baron Komura figuratl\-ely picks up his
hat and announces that it is useless to
proceed further. Mr. Witte at least
will not be precipitate. At to-morroWs
session, after article 2 (the limitation
of Russia's naval power in the Far
East) end 'article 12 (fishing rights on
the Russian littoral) are disposed of.
he will favor an adjournment until
Monday to hear the last word from St.
The pessimism to-night is
based on the fact that no progress was
made to-day. The exchange of views at
the morning session on article 9 (remu
neration for the cost of the war) show
ed at once that the plenipotentiaries
were as far apart as the poles, and it
was passed over. Article 10 (the sur
render of the interned Russian war
ships) was also passed, not, in the opin
ion of one of the plenipotentiaries,
\u25a0when a correspondent 6aw him to-.
night, because it could not have been
â¢ arranged, but because within the
shadow of the two main points in dis
pute hanging over the conference both
sides were cautious and preferred to
postpone it to the end. Article 2 (limi
tation of sea power) Is also adjustable
after modification, and article 12 will
present no difficulties. So that to-night
the situation was practically where it
was when Mr. Witte last Saturday pre
sented the Russian reply with its non
possumus to articles 5 and 9 (indem
nity and Saghalien).
AEITHER WILL YIELD. !
PORTSMOUTH, N; H.. Aug. 17.â The

DAY AT UOS ANGELES.
Special Dispatch \u25a0 to'. Thn Call.
NEW YORK, Arfg: 17.â Passengers com
ing ashore from the; Deutschland. this
evening brought ; a'' story; of â¢< the; fate â¢' of
Louis Jansen, a common ', sailor, > who
was so severely ; : punished '; by > a * ship's
olficer that he committed suicide by < leap
ing overboard.' ', By * several >of the ' i pas

flogged, ' but this i was indignantly denied
by several of the: officers. "'-'.'- '.: -.''.',. :\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0-,;
They . stated . that : flogging is prohibited
by merchant marine laws of Germany,
and that the only, punishment that can be
administered to seamen Is solitary con-
f finement,, except in the case of an attack
upon an officer, when force may be used
iby the officer in ; self-defense." " .
! , Mrs. Henry Siegel, "-. wif e of a prominent
merchant; : ; Mme. , Schumann-Heink, - the
grand opera singer; , Ethel Barrymore,' and
Robert Edeson are among those, who,. told
about Louis : Jansen having ' been ? punish
ed by the ship's officers, and that in sheer
desperation he had leaped to -: his - death
into the sea. Mrs. Siegel saw the ; man
deliberately leap overboard.
The long dispatches sent by Baron Ke
mura to his Government on this subject
after yesterday's session which were not
all off until 6 o'clock this morning makes
this probable. '.Possibly- an answer from
China is essential to final agreement upon
article 7 and this may be the true rea
son for the postponement after "accord
in principle" had been reached. China's
wish, to be consulted concerning articles
of the treaty affecting her territory must
be respected in this particular at least.
China may not care to assume the finan
cial burden involved" in taking over the
xoad- She certainly could not raise the
money without hypothecating the prop
erty, tf Japan is convinced that the road
will eventually become a paying commer
cial venture she might, herself, advanoe
the money or it might be raised for China
by. an international syndicate and become
a part of the system of Chinese imperial
railroads.' If not. Japan may, jand prob
ably would for the present, step into Rus
sia's shoes, although ' she has solemnly
promised China to restore Manchuria' and
to retain the railroad would be to retain
strategical control of the province.
The amount Russia will realize is im
possible to estimate. It will undoubtedly
be only a comparatively Ismail fraction
of the sum poured into it. By the terms
of the concession China had the privilege
of taking ' over the road at the end of
thirty-six years apon the repayment of
capital, construction and deficit charges.
Japan recognized , that Russia was en
titled to some remuneration. But this
basis is not known. The Russian claim
was founded, on the principle of inter
national law, that a belligerent occupying
territory can exercise the right of
usufruct of private property during occu
pation, but cannot confiscate as a spoil
of war. Mr. Wltte. In whose .brain was
born the conception of the Chinese East
ern Railroad, was particularly competent
to defend the rights of the company,
wiiich Russia claims is distinctly a pri
vate corporation, although making no
concealment of the fact that it was back
ed by the Russian Government because
of political considerations. The original
concession obtained- in 1599 for the Chi
nese Eastern Railway, then simply the
"cut-off" through northern Manchuria,
was obtained by the late Mr. Rothstein,
director of the Russo-Chinese Bank, and
Prince Okutomsky, and the company was
formed for the construction of the road.
In 189 S. after the lease of Port Arthur
and Tallenwan (Dalny) was obtained
from China, the concession for the south
ern branch was negotiated. It provided
for a Chinese president of the rpad. and
Shlng Kuchln, who had been the Chinese
Minister in St. Petersburg, was presi
dent until he fell a victim to the anti
foreign Boxer uprising in 1900.
The bonds Issued with the Government
guarantee were sold like Government
four per cent rentes and are now In the
hands of the banks and general public
like regular Government obligations. 'Al
though â¢ the loss on operation has been
heavy, the Russo-Chinese Bank always
believed It would become a remunerative
concern. One of the blir.extraordlnary
Items of expense - was the necessity : of
maintaining railroad guards. The south
ern branch, which now goes to " China,
gave especial promise of. being very
profitable.
AWAITKVG ANSWER.
tnent and Russia. Russia has agreed to
surrender the road to China and. give up
her concession obtained in IS9S, but China
must assent, and assent means she must
â¢gree to remunerate the . Russian Gov
ernment which guaranteed the bonds for.
the building of the road, in an amount
hereafter to be determined. Japan also
has her claim for the rebuilding of the
road destroyed by the Russian army, the
reconstruction , of bridges and change of
gauge. The matter remains primarily to
be adjusted by Japan and China and it is
not unlikely that the Tokio Government

Several weeks ago Presiding Justice N.

Barrett predicted that the next year

China, The Chinese boycott he pro
nounces the culmination of years of
remonstrance at what the Chinese be
lieve is discrimination on the part of
this country toward their countrymen.
China is now In the process of awak
ening to a sense of her latent power,
he said. She is coming to a realiza
tion of the true value of her markets.
China as a Government can have no
cause to feel a resentment toward this
Government, but the people of the'hlgh
er classes (and Barrett emphasized the
fact that there Is no greater mistake
than to believe that China as Â«. nation
is composed exclusively of coolies) can
not understand why its people should
BARRETT TALKS OF CHINA.
An unfortunate incident occurred prior
to* adjournment to-day for the day which
materially marred the success of the
cession. After listening to a flood of ora
tory that had extended over nearly four
.hours, barring interruptions from the
resolutions committee, which was impa
tient to feet started in its work, the del
egates openly rebelled against the furth
er continuation of the programme, and a
Elight was cast upon two of the speakers,
\u25a0which though -unintended, nevertheless
caused keen feeling. An Injudicious mo
tion was- made after G. W. Dickie of San
Francisco had concluded his address,
that the remaining speeches, those of P. J.
Van Loben Sela and Benjamin C. Wright
of San Francisco, be read by title, placed
on the records of the congress and copies
furnished to the press. The chairman re
fused to entertain the motion, but "the
damage had been done and both speakers,
offended, at the conduct of the congress,
declined to speak. -A motion was hur
riedly made to adjourn and the session
.came to an abrupt end.
John W. Xoble. first vice president
of the congress, the chairman of the
' day, called to order the second day's
session of the congress. After a few
words .regarding the importance to the
.West, : and particularly the Pacific
Coast;' of the- topics to be considered
to-day. General Nohle said that _on the
subject of "The Columbia River." one
of the best posted men In the country
and one who had done much for its
benefit would address the congress.
General Noble then introduced Major
W. C. Langfitt, U. S. A. Major Lang
fltt fllscussed the engineering problems
presented by the river. .. Theodore Wil
cox was the next speaker. He was fol
lowed John Barrett of Portland, Or.,
United States Minister to Colombia,
who' spent almost a decade In the
.Orient and who from long association
is familiar with the customs and be
liefs of the higher classes of China.
PORTLAND, Aug. 17.â That the better
classes of Chinese are discriminated
against to an unwarranted extent, that -a
less stringent administration of the ex
clusioa law, or if necessary a limited
reconstruction is advisable, was urged
by the speakers on Oriental trade at the
eecocd Cay's session of the Trans-Missis
sippi â¢Commercial Congress to-day.
These ideas were brought out with
especial.. force by John Barrett, United
States Minister to Colombia, and by
Theodore B. Wllcox, president of the
congress. Wilcox asserted that It would
be better to even admit' a limited num
ber of Chinese laborer* Into the United
States to satisfy China. The Oriental
markets, be said, had "been developed at
the expense of almost a quarter of a cen
tury's labor by manufacturers, of the
Pacific Coast, whose efforts will be nulli
fied If the boycott against American prod
ucts Is successful.
"America Is in no position to act In an
independent manner, ac this country pro
duces nothing that the Chinese want
which cannot be obtained from other na
tions," 6aid Wilcox.
Barrett, during the course of his ad
dress, emphasized the point that It is not
to compel the introduction of coolie labor
that thÂ« Chinese are remonstrating,
but aultÂ« the contrary. The boy
cott is a remonstrance because the sons
of noblemen, refined and well educated
gentlemen, are held . In the detention
houses by unwise immigration officials
at our ports of entry for a period of
tea days at a time, and compelled to herd
â¢with tha lowest classes of their country
men during that time.

Van Loben \u25a0 Sels addressed a few words to

If; it were against their wishes, and sat
down: General Noble then introduced
Wright. -Wright made a brief statement;
to the same effect as* had. Van Loben
Sels, and like .him declined to deliver his
address. The congress then adjourned;
until to-morrjOw. c .
The congress j to-day remedied the con : j

water. ' and in deep .water .; we will, be much
safer in our own ships." â¢ - - â¢'. .Â» \u25a0â¢ -â¢:
When Thurber concluded, ithe order, of
business was changed and the introduc
tion of resolutions took place. Most Im
portant among these were those Indors
ing statehood for New Mexico, reclama
tion of arid lands, advocating a merchant
marine, and the establishing of a depart
ment of mines and mining. - The next
speaker .was George W. Dickie of . the
Union Iron Works, San Francisco. His
topic Was .the merchant marine. >
Dickie, while admitting that a naval
power, both . commercial and military, is
riot perhaps absolute necessity," main
tained that c the â¢ history j and progress gof
this country demonstrates that In certain
stages of. development it Is a desirable
thing.' He advocated Government aid to
>ship-building' and : concluded: ' * \u25a0/. ,
STATE AID FOR SHIPPING.
So far as the \u25a0 Japanese ure concerned,
he # believes that the demand, for* labor In
Japan, Korea, Manchuria. Saghalien and
Formosa, together with the loss , of able,
bodied "Japanese In'battle * will follow the
ending of the war. and. that for^years to
come there ..will Jje only an inconsiderable
proportion that will seek entrance into
the United States. 1 . '
â¢ As to the Chinese, he asserts, the num
ber of coolies who might wish to enter
our borders is controlled to a great ex
tent by powerful guilds) which are inter
ested in seeing that the eupply of cqol
les in America shall not exceed the legit
imate demand./ Furthermore, said- he,
with China's increased development there
will be demand at home for laborers and
the Chinese known preference for his own
land will help to limit emigration' to this
country. '
. WAXTS YELLOW OPPORTUNITY.
Another aspect of the Oriental subject
was treated by. F. B. .Thurber of New
York City, president of the United States
Export; Association, who spoke on "Fu
ture Markets in the Orient." In part he
said:
Our foreign policy should favor "the â¢ open
door" aiid to get this .we. should make reason
able concessions Sn our tariff policy, through
reciprocity or otherwise. . :
Afi a minor means to this end systematize
our consular service on a basis of permanency,
promotion and adequate compensation. We
have superior .talent in our consular service
as a whole, but it is dwarfed and discouraged
by tlÂ»Â« lack of these prime requisites.' ...
Revise our treaties .with Oriental countries
Â» that while protecting American â¢ labor
against "the yÂ«Uow peril" it will give both
American labor and American capital the
"yellow- opportunity" to (supply 890,000,000 of
Asiatics with what they* want to buy and
what we want to sell. In other, words, don't
let the unreasoning fears of American trades
unionism insult the educated Asiatics who
come to trade with us or study wi th . uÂ», even
If a ftw "coolies'." do get in under false pre
tenses. I belle\-e' in the dignity of peaceful
American labor and that American -capital
should assist In maintaining It, but 1 also be
lieve that "yellow Journalism." which'seeks
to play upon the prejudices and fears of or
ganized labor, is a greater peril than either
Eastern or Western . immigration. ' '
.In support of this assertion he called
attention to the' fact that along with
Japan's development she has become a
greater , purchasing nation.' ."Since
China' has commenced to foster her own
Interests at the treaty ,ports t her trade
with the tJnited . States has * grown to
a value of $92,000,000 per annum, triple
what i,t was a decade ago.
It is 'illogical, Barrett said, in view of.
the example" of Japan, to predict ' that
with the material, social ; arid political
awakening of ' China, she will iecome
threatening to the welfare and happiness
of the wcrld at large; -The crying need
in the development of trade with China
is the increase of her purchasing capa
city. Her international resources, and
the country gridironed with railways pro
vide the Chinese masses with money and
they will purchase correspondingly. '
China's foreign trade amounts now to
less than one dollar per capita, Japan's
to seven dollars, although barely twenty
years' ago it was no more than Is China's,
If China's trade is developed' to: five dol
lars per capita, we would' then have a
trade of ?2,000,000,000 per annum. To pre
pare the way for winning our share of
this increase is surely worth our best ef
forts. Marvelous growth, of the Oriental
and Pacific trade of this ; country, now
amounting to $350,000,000, was pointed out.
particular stress being laid upon the fact
that our exports to China are double our
imports. The speaker advised his hear
ers that harsh measures may. tend to in
jure such a mighty traffic. Barrett did
not discuss the merits or demerits of. the'
Chinese exclusion law. â¢: .
be treated differently from correspond
ing- classes of other nations.
The higher classes of China, accord-
Ing: to the speaker, are. proud of .their
own peculiar civilization, of their phil
osophy and philosophers, of their
rivaled antiquity as an independent na
tion, of their customs, characteristics,
social fabric, homogeneity, vast popu
lation and great potential wealth; and
that fhey have not made the same ad
vancement as has Japan in the world's
political, development is no' sign that it
will not come. He predicts that it is
only a question' of time, however, be
fore China, like Japan, will startle the
world with her onward movement.
Barrett deprecated*^ the spirit of
patronage, the "holier. than thou" atti
tude with which foreigners are wont to
treat the Chinese, instead of sympa
thetic co-operation: This spirit among
traders, travelers, soldiers and sailors
has had a cumulative influence which
has added strength 1 to such movements
as the Chinese boycott. The speaker
minimized the so-called "yellow peril,"
terming it .a "bogie," and thinks the
day will dome when it may become' a
"yellow blessing.".*- . â¢

riage took place with 'Chartotta Newman,
her sister, it was bigamous and void, and
Collins could not be I guilty \u25a0of perjury in

WASHINGTON, Aug. j 17.â One ; of . the
first important tasks awaiting Mr. Shonts,
when he assumes .the. presidency' of : the
Isthmian Canal Commission, -Is the
conservation, of .the ; balance remaining of
the appropriation of $3,000,000 so as- to
guard against a stoppage . of the work
of canal building': ! Calling to : : his aid
several expert accountants, the exact
state of the finances of the commission
was ascertained ' and iit- wu found that
the work could be â¢ steadily j prosecuted
until Congress at, the next regular ses
sion should have ample opportunity to
provide ' more funds. Therefore the { bal
ance on hand was .divided -into, monthly
allotments which have soT far been closely
adhered Ito save in vone'vcase,"^ where an
unexpected, demand- arose' for Â° additional
transportation facilities. Thus the com
mission has, â¢! It believes, avoided the
necessity .of availing { itself of. the priv
ilege â¢ granted by Congress \of issuing
bonds to meet expenditures. "-â¢ .; \u25a0
,The commission to-day issued the fol
lowing statement on this point: : .
It 'wai â¢ officially : . atatad ''\u25a0 it' thÂ» IÂ«thmlan
Canal OommlÃslon to-day- that off the appro
priation by Congress of $10,000,000 for the con
struction, of. the canal, there was- on April 1
1903. the date on which the present commli
slon took hold, an available balance to' the
credit of this appropriation of '17, 426,568.
-During: the month of April the expenditures
from this appropriation agrgreg-ated $475,000
during:- May $500,000; .during- Juno *. $659 000
during- July $770,000. for wages, salaries, ma^
t'rlals. supplies and equipment. ." .: .
During July there was an umuru&T expendi
ture for the purchase of two ihlps at JC50.000
each, not Included . In the estimated July ex
penditures. ">;\u25a0 \u25a0 ;. ' ,
During the month -of-- August, up â¢to and
Including the 16th, $250,000 had beÂ«n expend
ed. This left to the balance of the appropria
tion on Auruit 18. $2,816,713, In addition to
which each of the two . disbursing , of fleers hail
on hand $500,000 on that date. . .
It will . be . seen from the f ocegolng that thÂ«
average expenditure -per month, \u25a0 leaving out of
consideration the purchase at th- \u25a0 two ships,
was in the neighborhood . of $650,000, and at
that rate of expenditure thÂ« $2,816,713 will
last until early int January. \u25a0 which' Is accord
ing to the schedule fixed ,by \u25a0 Mr. Shonts on

The new church building is designed
In the early Gothic style, with a tower

year if the. convention goes < to 'the
coast. California has more than- 300
votes that will go the way the steering
committee, of which Jerome Bassity is
chairman," decides is best for San Fran
cisco's chances.
With the .Californians it . is "every
thing for Frisco" and the office seek
ers are without their own delegations
to use as a leverage to land the plums
sought. So much trading is being done,
votes for ; the next convention place
being exchanged for votes for presi
dential candidates, that predictions are
unreliable, at best. Many of the Cali

.were in tallyhos and brakes with Jap
anese sunshades and banners boosting

Shot Full
of Holes.
"I am 65 years old, and have
Seen a great sufferer from
headache all my life. One of
Dr. Miles' circulars was left
at my door, and what it con-
tained about headache inter-
ested me, so that. l determined
to invest a dollar in their make
of shot, and go gunning ; for
that headache. The first charge
brought it down, but I contin-
ued to shoot until the thing
was shot so full of holes that
I believe it will never come to
life again, I consider â¢it the
work of a "good Samaritan,"
to spread the knowledge of
what Dr. Miles' Anti-Pain Pills
will do." I. F. MOORE,

There Is no reason for not eoing to
hear the Royal Hawaiian' Band at the
Alhambra this week, not even the usual
one of being musical. The person acidly
particular about his ensemble may just
ao well stay away, however, although for
thatâ the Hawaiian kind of ensemble^-"
the novelty and piquancy, of the pro-,
gramme largely atone. It Is something
to see, too, this Royal Hawaiian Band of
khaki clad, lei-garlanded, chocolate-col
ored natives. Captain H. Berger con
ducts, and it Is something also to see this
veteran leader get on his toes and then
pull himself down by hi 3 coat tails. In
short, there are all sorts of entertainment
thrown in with the Royal Hawaiian
Band, not the least of which Is the ex
tremely Interesting and taking native
music.
| There n are thlrty-p.dd. men J?and;;
WeJl^equlppetT as â¢to'instrum^nts' and^moro
modestly as to technique. But they play
In a spirited, happy-go-lucky, and entirely*
engaging fashion; everything -'. from the-
Sousa "Stars and Stripes' *â¢' march *to an.
"II Trovatore," .evidently/, arranged* oni
Hawaiian' linesâat least- we haven" t r: time
here to listen to them that long. One
thing, the band plays. In tune
throughout."^ i The time, .well; thay have
evidently,^ been pretty well ( used ': to tak
ing, their own. If you want their antithe
sis, the Kilties, "with their rigid and unco
quid rhythms, will well serve.
The organization brings its own vocal
ist, Madame Nane Alapal, who sings na
tive songs with considerable charm. She
brings more than a spice of humor to the
work, when it comes to -the singing of
the "hula hula" songs, four or live of
which she gave. Her voice Is sweet and
has a peculiar oboe-like note, excellently
suited to the native music. Madame Ala
pal wore the native holoku (anglice
wrapper) and around her neck a. feather
lei, more valued by the Hawaiian belle
than diamonds by a show girl.. The audi
ence was extravagant in its enthusiasm
over her songs, and the singer gracious
in response.
Several attractive numbers were also
given by the Hawaiian Glee Club, who
accompanied themselves on guitars, vio
lins and native Instruments. One home
sick Hawaiian . yelled, â¢ "irakal," (good)
from the gallery at the favorite "Tom!
Tomi," and the club waved back to him.
It was a delightfully friendly affair all
round, and Captain .Berger is to be.'con
gratulated on interesting exhibit. The
band will ] play here this and to-morrow
afternoons /and this and to-morrow even
ings. I think every one should enjoy It.

The citizens of San Bruno attended thÂ©

trustees to order the construction of a
school at San Bruno Park. Complaint js
made that the children ot San Bruno
must travel too great a distance to
South San Francises and to remedy this
disadvantage a school site has already
been donated. It Is at the discretion, of
the school trustees, however, whether or
not the new bulldlns: \ will be allowed.
The matter has been taken under advise
ment- .
At, the public session of citizens called
by. the school trustees to determine the
question, R. 'K. Patchell was chosen
chairman. After an animated discus
sion It was decided not to purchase a
new site but to enlarge the present
grounds to accommodate the new build
ing. This arrangement seems to be sat
isfactory to everybody concerned, as the
Increased grounds will be large enough
and the t place will be centrally located
for many years to come.

consisting principally of broken glass
and a few shattered brick walls at the

was caused by the explosion of ' the
dynamite-house, which blew up two
hours after the nitro-glycerin house
was destroyed, was due to care taken
by the company's officials. Superin
tendent Nielsen was particularly active
in his warnings and a large force of
men g-uarded danger points from in
trusion. Neither Superintendent Niel

uncovered any facts that would tend
to explain the nitro-glycerin house ex

that her. interest in the estate was to

The possibilities that a man of Mr.
Damrosch's intelligence is able to see
In the position of musical master at a
great State University, adjacent to a
great city, are understood to have ap
pealed, to him, .as they might to any
savant who appreciates a commanding
position in a great field.
Damrosch doubtless understands that
his place as head of the university's
music department would be merely the
beginning of activities which could In*
cltr*e the.-.conductlngr'^f symphony or
chestras in San Francisco, the lectur^
ing on musical subjects in various coast
cities, ttie expounding lot Wagnefian
and oth6r muslCgin such ways as the
master might see fit to engage in. All
of .these possibilities, with others that
are perhaps known only to the parties
most" directly interested, may be con
sidered to have influenced Damrosch
to give favorable ear to the university
authorities' proposal. . \u25a0\u25a0 .- > . c li

Little James Cox, scarcely able to
toddle, was left alone in the ward of
the Infants' Shelter a moment late yes
terday afternoon, while his nurse, Miss
do H.-irper, went to get some carbolic
acid. The. nurse was bathing a wound
on one of the children with a phenol
solution. She believed she had not
enough of the poison in the bottle so
left it standing on a low table while
she .went for more. The bottle
contained an ounce or two of acid.
As soon -as Miss de Harper was
gone little James Cox toddled over
to the table and swallowed the con
j tents of the bottled With a cry of pain
the babe fell unconscious.
The poisoned child was hurriedly
taken to the Central Emergency Hos
pital, where everything possible was
done by Dr. Pinkham. The babe never
regained consciousness and at a late
hour was in a critical condition.
Miss de Harper denied strenuously
that she left much acid in tluÂ» bottle.
The child's - parents are said to be
separated. The father, who supports the
child, is -a miner at Grass Valley.
Should the baby, die Coroner Leland will
conduct a rigid investigation into what
appears to have been gross careless
ness. The Infants 1 Shelter people were
loth to discuss the. affair and desired
to convey, the idea that the baby was
responsible for its own poisoning.
The baby lips and. mouth are seared
with the fire of carbolic acid and tho
unconscious child gasps for - breath.

believes it will ' die. Miles away in

enhanced J by ! an - Interesting experiment.
theT- result of "which -has, been to insure
their.: future* as .much as. any .other cause
that has yet been discovered.'
"For a thorough diagnosis of a
malarial case, one must have a micro
scopic examination of the blood cor
puscles. I think this a good point to
remember for most any case â and then
one dpes not have to depend on the
outward' symptoms entirely."
The speaker - told^tiow important it
was to know the use of the micro
scope â the instrument by which he
made his fame â and how there was- a
dearth of this Jsnowledge among the
medical men of. England. He suggested
this latter point as the reason forgiv
ing the explanation of . the process of
preparing plates for examination.
In this case the matter to be ex
amined was blood, and Sir Patrick told
his method of spreading the blood on
a glass, previously labeled, using a
needle to open the skin: and -drawing
the needle through the blood to spread
it on the glass. He said this method
would scatter the blood over a great
area and expose the corpuscles- to* f the
view'ofthe lens.
"Trypauosomiasls" ' was the subject
of the. morning lecture, the speaker
talking , also on the "leishman" para
site and the kala azar, a species of
ravaging disease that was called the
"Black Death." .The latter ; germs are
said to be found in' Africa. China, India,
Mexico and ! possibly the United ' States.
The leishman and { trypanosom , are i said
to be related In species and produce the
sleeping sickness.
The lectures by the English knight
are to continue the remainder of tnis
week, when he will spend a few weeks
at the seashore. The audience has
taken on a professional air-
Medical men from all points have
been drawn to hear the master of bac
teriology relate his valuable experi
ences. It Is said physicians have ar
ranged their practice for the afternoons
so as to have their mornings free to
attend the lecture, and again in the
evening they assemble at I.ane Hall,
Cooper Medical College, for the night
address on tropical diseases.
The subject of the evening lecture
was malaria and the determination of
the effects and. symptoms. Sir Patrick
gave the results of many of his experi
ments and diagnoses of the cafes that
were considered baffling by the Lon
don medical experts. "It doesn't fol
low that because a patient has one
disease he hasn't got any other,"
averred the pathologist, "and if there
is a complication of diseases accom
panying the malaria, special care must
be taken lest the less dangerous sick
ness overcomes one. When sick a good
cure to remember is to look for other
symptoms along with' the ones under
investigation and if another disease is
found, get rid of it also, and the patient
has a far better chance for recovery.
"Although a person may have many
kinds of ailments, one will always pre
dispose the other. In this way a care
ful study of the symptoms with a trial
of various treatments will lead to good
results.

That fire did not destroy many build
ings south of Market street Wednesday
night was not the fault of a fire fiend
who applied a torch in several places,
and who is supposed to have been re
sponsible for one disastrous blaze on
Harrison street. Yesterday the police dls
rovered that an attcmyt was made to
burn the premises at 7G2 Harrison street,
and also that a blaze was started in a
building on Folsom street between Third
and Fourth streets.
Captain Burnett of the detective force
and Captain Spillane of the southern dis
trict were informed of the attempt to
destroy the Harrison-street property
t>arly > esterday morning. A lire had been
"kindled ir. an alleyway beneath a num
ber of flats, and it was due to the alert
ness cf neighbors that it was extin
g-uij-hed before any great damage or loss
of life was the result. The police are
now of the opinion that the r.res at 747
and %O Harrison street were started by
an incendiary ar.d the investigation will
be continued until the guilty party is
found.
Shortly after 10 o'clock the. family of
Charles Zimmermann. at 762 Harrison
street, detected the odor of smoke on
the premises. A search was made and
es a result flr3 was found in the base
ment. The flames had gained some head
way and it recuired the assistance of
several neighbors before the danger was
past. When Miss Zimmermann located
the fire she called Harry Sheehan. who
lives in the flat above, 762 A Harri
son street. Sheehan worked on the blaze
and dragged the debris that had been
Ignited into the street.
When Sheehan had extinguished the
f;n? and was preparing to return to his
home the fire across the street at 747
and 749 Harrison street broke out. The :
flames were breaking from the roofs of
the buildings and had evidently started
from the rear. It was with difficulty that
tevoral of the occupants of these prem
ises were saved.
When the poltce started the Investiga
tion yesterday it was found that a de
liberate attempt had * been made to set
-fire to the flats across the street. In
a narrow alleyway a teap of paper and
debris had been collected and Ignited. The
hr<? burned merrily until it was discov
frcC by the Zimmermann family. The
fire across the street started in a wash
room, which has its entrance from the
\u25a0treet, and the police are of the opinion
that the firebug operated in the same
manner as he did on the opposite side
of Harrison street. While the detec
tives were working on this case word
rÂ«arhed the southern police station, of
another fire that had been started on
Folsom street between Third and Fourth
erects. It would appear as if an at
umpt had been made to destroy all the
property in the vicinity and it is likely j
that the guilty party will soon be ar- i
rested. i

minx is often a bewitching being, and
she may quite easily be married. She
need not be pert, as the world knows
pertness, a quality that shows Itself In
poked-out chin and that sort of remark
that is half flippancy, half disrespect,
and wholly displeasing to serious
judges of human conduct.
Pertness, moreover, infers ill-breed
ing, and many of my. minxes (other
people's, too) have been well-bred.
Take Bijou, that queen of minxes.
You may not know her. If not, you
can make her acquaintance in the novel
of the name by Gyp. The Comtesse de
Martel has depicted her with all the
charm that is indispensable to the true
minx. Every one loves her, from her
grandmother, whom she secretly rules,
to the children whom she allows to run
over the fuchsia beds. Not a man in
the book but is her slave. Her methods.
â but read the book! It is not exactly
edifying, but it is intensely clever.
Bijou's good breeding is unimpeachable.
That Is the point I wish to make.
When I heard the other day that a
theater manager had . received . a tele
gram: "Please reserve two stalls close
together and one some distance from
them," I immediately concluded that a
minx had been at work on that mes
sage. One can" picture' her, arriving at
the theater and expressing her sorrow,
that one of the party of three has un
fortunately to be seated a long way
from the other two.
WHAT is a minx? The dictionary
replies: A pert young girl. But
this is a very meager and even
Another minx I knew was the most
deliciously impudent person I ever
met. ; She was born without the
smallest grain of reverence. What,
then, was the surprise of our com
munity when it was asked by this very
girlâ this laughing piece of irrespon
sibility â for subscriptions to a world
known charity! There was not much
hypocrisy or false pretense about the
matter. Some laughed and gave.
Others laughed and did not give. But
all with. one accord remarked, "What,
you?" Eventually, the subscribers
were all invited to a grand toffee-mak
ing and got their moneys worth in
the form of very excellent toffee made
with the best white sugar and covered
so bountifully with almonds that when
you broke It^ pieces flew.
Now was she^a minx?, Or was she
merely brimming -with * fun? Asked
about the charity,- She sald-J'-T collected
so little that^ it wasn't worth sending."
I can hear a pragmatical voice 1 ob
serve: "She broke the "law, that girl."
But she was a much nicer minx (that
toffee was delicious!) than the next on
my list. This was one of those girls,
fortunately rare, who are utterly un
scrupulous,^ think' nothing of reading
other people's private letters and are
never so happy as when making,mis
chief. One such girl is enough to set
a whole village by the ears. 'She is
always telling some one something
nasty that (she says) some one else
has said. This often turns out to be
what she herself has said to the per
son she pretends to quote! She is, per
haps, too wicked to be included in my
portrait gallery of mere minxes.
Was it a minx, who, having been
made the confidante of a' love affair by
another girl, got, possession of the
When the inevitable discovery came,
the consequence was that her father
said: "Get thee to a nunnery," and the
world said: "Serve her right." But a
minx and a nunnery are incompatible

down with a man as frivolous as her
self, and they trod the world gayly.

that the others were out of the way,
waiting for her at a safe distance.
young man's .letters and sent them to
his father? No. She, too. was more
than minx, and it would be an insult
to thie feline race to call her cat.
That is almost the worst of a minx.
She so easily develops claws. But as a
rule she walks the ways well pleased
and careless; intent upon her bit of
fun. Like the boys and the frogs she
pursues her, pastime regardless of the
feelings other victims.
One of my minxes, .seeing a promis
ing flirtation, and wishing to put a stop
to it, spread a damaging report about
the young man, whom she herself ad
mired. Then she told him that she be
lieved in him and would not give up
his friendship, etc., etc. The little plot
had every prospect of success, when
owing to an accident he discovered that
his boycott had .been originated by
Miss Minx.,
My pet minx is Ann in Bernard
Shaw's "Man- and Superman." There
is almost sublimity about some of her
methods, and though she is walking
over people's necks and telling shock-
Ing fibs there is much fascination about
her. One would give something to
know what Rhoda. her younger sister,
thought of her. If you suspect any girl
of being a minx, the surest way to,
find out- if you are right is ,to study
the, manner of her young brothers and
sisters to her.
Cruel?. Yes. The minx, is cruel in
her play,' like many other pretty things
in nature; cat with mouse, kitten with
butterfly, brother .with sister.
I have reserved for" the last my minx
who, having kept a nice young man
dangling at her heels for a "couple of
years, answered his appeal for a de
cided answer as follows: "I do not love
you now, but if^you will go on taking
me to the theater and on the river, and
dining me at restaurants, I shall per
haps like you better." > .
With one or. two admirers of this
kind, Miss Jlinx may have a very good
time. But Nemesis, though j lame of
foot, is always to be reckoned with.
That limp of hers disappears surpris
ingly at. times, and more particularly
when "settling, day" arrives and
naughty girls have to pay up. .

AN UNANNOUNCED TRAGEDY.
WHY should a man insist that Heav
en Is his home, and then pay large
fees to a' physician to keep him
away from home a while longer?
If mind really does rule matter always
and everywhere, does the death of a
mental healer merely prove that he was
afflicted with a lack of Intellect?
If the set really is "smart," why doesn't
it occasionally, prove it by doing some
thing worth while?
If "ignorance of the law excuses' no
man,", does it excuse a supreme court
when it reverses a decision theretofore
made by It?
-Any way, why is life so full of these
problems? And what Is the person who
would like to find the warp of truth run
ning through the fabric to do about
them? ."

FROM Chicago recently came the news that women make bar
barians of men. Now from Chicago comes the information
that women are crowding men to the wall in all of the indus
tries and activities of life in this country. This somber announce
ment was made by Mr. Bodie, whose forebodings are of the most
cheerless character. He sees .woman in a conspiracy against man.
With the most admirable, if alarming, subtlety, women begin
this undermining of men by managing to be born in greater num
bers. No one can beat such strategy. Man not being born, natur
ally cannot resent the invasion of his industrial reservation by.
women whose prudent forethought caused them to be born women.
Mr. Bodie says that "Man, like the Indian, is dying out and being
driven out.*' Serves him right for not being born to fight for his
rights. Not only are more women born, but fewer of them die.
The crop grows and stays and sticks to it. At the same time fewer
men are born and more of them die.
It is enough to lower the pride of a policeman to see how man
is going down hill. In a few years the last man may be expected
to gaze dejectedly upon a feminine world, from which he has been
violently expelled, driven out to die. It is evident that women are
in a great conspiracy to down man. That is why they make a bar
barian of him every chance they get. They can handle a barbarian
easier, and dispose of him quicker. Really, from the Chicago point
of view the hostilities have reached a stage that warrants the inter
ference of the President. Why not address an "identical note" to
the two sexes advising them to consider terms of peace and appoint
commissioners for a pourparler?
Something should be done and before it is too late. Mr. Bodie
pays that man will very soon be driven to the soil and to struggle
for existence in those callings where his physical endurance can
support the drudgery of unskilled labor. It is plain, then, that if
the conspiracy of woman take from him his physical endurance he
will have no recourse, and must jump off the earth.
MAN GOING TO THE WALL.
If this commercial war affected our trade with Germany alone
we could perhaps afford to lose the $100,000,000 annually of trade
that it will take away from us. But Germany is in commercial al
liance, offensive and defensive, with a half score of other nations,
with which we have trade. Senator Cullom says that we will meet
the situation with a differential tariff, and not by reciprocity. There
fore California should begin to study differentials.
This deprives us of the favored nation privilege, and it is
said will deprive us of $i00,c00,000 of trade annually with Ger
many alone. The new German tariff, which becomes effective
next' March, affects 75 per cent of our exports to that country. On
cereals it increases the rate against us from 120 to 250 per cent; on
dried and canned goods from 50 to 360 per. cent ; on manufactures
and machinery from 60 to no per cent. Some of these differentials
will interest our readers. The duty on hops per- 100 kilogrammes,
220 pounds, is, maximum $16 66, minimum $4 76.
That is to say, American hops must pay the higher rate and
favored nation hops the lower. On meats the maximum is
Sio 71, minimum $8 33, which, of course, excludes ,our cured
meats. Our wood alcohol must pay a duty of $4 76, while that of
favored nations is admitted free. The determination of Germany
to hit us hard is shown in another way. The lumber differential
is not oppressive on rough lumber and there is none at all on
dressed. But to shut our lumber out a higher freight rate is
charged on American lumber by the German railways, which are
all owned by the Government.
rnHE CALL, has raised a. warning against the intrusion of pre
| judice or passion into the discussion of the proposed changes
* in our tariff, alleged to be necessary in the interest of our ex
port trade. The proponents of change by reciprocity met this week
in Chicago, and news dispatches were sent out from that city an
nouncing that the expenses of the conference were paid by the
meat and machinery trusts. Of course this was done for the pur
pose of enlisting anti-trust prejudice on the side of anti-reciprocity.
Upon the general question involved the East is against the
Middle West, with California apparently in alliance with the ex
treme East. The Chicago conference was not a one-sided -affair,
but seems to have furnished a free forum for discussion, in that
respect following the example of the California State Board of
Trade, which first took up the subject on this Coast. As a result of
free discussion at Chicago the reciprocity plan- is abandoned. At
best it is a cumbersome method and slow to move. A national pol
icy that makes reciprocity treaties desirable, because expedient >at
the time, may so change as to make them undesirable, and their
abrogation disturbs trade, which requires stability of policy for its
extension and its profits. \u2666 ; \u25a0': â¢ /
The conference decided a dual tariff to be the preferable in
strument for meeting the discriminating tariffs of continental
Europe. The only criticism of this was that in adopting it we
would be merely imitating our commercial enemies.* This, if an
argument, was set at rest by the speech of Senator Cullom of
Illinois, chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.
He said :
"But if we cannot secure the ratification of reciprocity treaties,
there is one other method that was seriously considered by the
Committee on Foreign Relations more than two years ago, when
it became apparent that the reciprocity treaties could not be ratified,
and that is the adoption of a maximum and a minimum tariff. Have
a minimum tariff, applicable to all nations which give our products
the most favored nation treatment, and a maximum tariff, say 25 per
cent higher, to apply to nations which discriminate against our
products/
It will be seen from this that American, statesmen discussed the
differential tariff two years before Germany professed to discover
the principle and induced its adoption by her allies in the commer
cial war against us. Our trade with Germany has been up to this
time regulated by the old treaty of 1828, entered into with Prussia
and the towns of* the Hanseatic League, Bremen, Lubeck, etc. That
treaty contained the favored nation clause. Now Germany has
made treaties based on a differential tariff with Russia, Austria,
Italy, Switzerland, Roumaniaj Belgium, Servia and several South
American states, in renewal of former treaties, but, it is said, with
the secret understanding that she is to denounce and abrogate the
treaty of 1828.

THE GIRL'S STORY.
IT was the first time the stenographer
had told a story and all the boarders
came in oft the front steps to hear it.
"When I came to this city a year
ago." she said, "I needed JluO extra to
take me through college and set me up
In business. I borrowed it from a man
whose folks had lived in our town and
were acquainted with my folks. '.
"After a few months I got my position,
and in driblets I paid back the $100. On
Tuesday of this week I stint him the last
installment of $5. : I inclosed it in the very
nicest kind of a letter I knew how to
write. I was truly grateful for the man's
assistance, and I told him so. Thursday
morning I got my letter back. The enve
lope was addressed in his writing:. Not a
i word did it contain, besides my letter.
; The money had been taken out, but there
; was not a word in acknowledgment of its
receipt. I was puzzled and worried. At
lunch time I went up to his office to find
out what It meant. The man was very
frank.
" The fact is,* he said, *my wiXÂ» haÂ»
found out that I loaned you COO. It made
hex furious, and in order to keep peace I
made several promises which she exacted.
Among other thmgs I promised that iS I
ever - heard from you again I would re
turn the letter unopened. .That was. not
exactly possible, because I had opened
this before I knew whom It was from,
but I did return It unread/
".'But you kept the money?* I said. *
" ,'Yes,' said he, 'I will giva you a re
ceipt if you like.' V
"But I was too hurt and humiliated to
wait for It. That may be a man's Me*
of honor, but it seems to me- â **
"Honor r* interrupted tho top floor rh*L
"Way, that man is worse than a brute.
If he was. going to send the letter back
he ought, in. all justice, to have sent tha
money, too."
"Not at all," exclaimed the threa mar

him. His duty to bis fanu>y required him
to take it, yet he was bound by his prom

"But you'll be one Just this once for me, won't you,
dear?" '/ '
'.'Yes, I suppose so, but you needn't think you can bam
boozle me by 'dearing' me."
And so G. Algernon Knickerbocker turned in, secure
in the thought that he would catch the train. But he was
rather lonely: in this respect, for a few thousand, other
sleepy New Yorkers failed to get hold of so amiably dlsr
posed a "Hello Girl," says the New York World.
Urftil recently it has been the custom of the telephone
company to permit its subscribers to* use the central sta
tion girls for early morning alarm clocks. They would
take the number on a slip Indicating the time the sleeper
wanted to be called and the girl , would jingle his bell.
But in a short time the company found, that this was
about the. largest^ part of its business, and decided that it
would have to be* stopped. .
The only way. to get round the ukase against making
the "Hello Girl" haul- you back to. consciousness ' in the
early morning hour 3 now is to promise her an automobile
or a pint of diamonds. . j

"Yes. I'm awake and hear you. What Is It you want to
say?"
"Why, I have to catch an early train out. of town; in
the morning and- 1 want you to ring, me up not a minute
later than ten before 6. Don't be a minute late about it,
or I shall not have time to catch the train. Wouldn't
ask you to do this for me, but my family are all out of
town and I'm all alone here. .-..-.
"You won't forget me, will you, dear, for I'm a perfect
sleepy head, and I know I shall never get awake if I'm
not called. Just turn on my telephone bell and keep it
Jingling till you hear from me, that's a good girl, and
then I'll not forget you the next time Christmas rolls
around. Got my phone lashed right alongside of the head

It will bring me up standing. Will you?"
"Oh, yes. I suppose I can call you," but you mustfnot^say

me of one of .the first minxes I ever

she was forever introducing to her

Another feature will be the magnifi
cent display of horses. Among these will
be the 300 head purchased by James A.
Bailey, the manager of the show, during
the oast winter in the New York live
stock market, which the New York Her
ald, in its market report, said was the
largest order ever placed In any horse
market In the world. The cost of these
horses In this one order was $100,500, or
an average of $335 each. In addition to
these 300 horses, there are some 200 more,
which include the horses used in the
arena, thoroughbreds of almost every
epecies. A list of star circus celebrities
fills the enormous programme. Any one
of them might be selected for Individual
mention and be well worthy of it. Per
haps the most unique performances given
In the world are the several thrilling
Parisian death-defying acts, In which the
fearless experts tempt fate twice daily
in a manner which shows that they hold
life at a trifling value, no matter how
much money they may receive for the
act. Of all the well-nigh miraculous
performances given on a bicycle, those
of these artists thoroughly surpass in
daring, ' danger, dexterity, strength and
skill. One, the Dip of Death, consists in
looping the loop in an automobile, a thrill,
ing act performed by a young lady; an
other flies through the air on a bicycle
and makes a ftight over two chasms
while speeding down an incline, thus
doubly defying death twice daily.

to September 10, at Mission Park, Eight
eenth and Dolores 6treets. *
There is a general expectation that the
Barnum & Bailey Show will, in the mat
ter of size, more than ever merit its title
"The Greatest Show on Earth." The fact
that it requires at least double the num
ber of cars ever used before by any show
for its transportation substantiates the
statement, but aside from Its bigness, it
will exhibit an enormous number of new
and exclusive features. So numerous are
these features that it is impossible in any
limited space to name them all, but a
few of them are of such striking excel
lence that they may be mentioned. Among
them is the great spectacle prelude,
with which the performance begins,
which Is said, without the employment of
extravagant language, to be the richest
and most costly spectacle ever presented
to the American public. It employs the
greatest number of people ever seen In
a display of that sort, who are garbed
In the most costly attire ever used, either
upon a stage or In the' arena. It is a
duplication of the great Durbar in In
dia.
Wonderful Repertoire of
Strange and Heroic
Features.
BAKNIDI & BAILEY'S
CIRCUS IS COMING
ACTTRESS WHO HAS BEEN EN
GAGED FOR LEADING LADT BT
DEXIS O'SULLIVAN.
In securing the services of Lillian
Alb<>rtson for his leading woman, Denis
O'Sullivan. who opens Sunday after
noon at the Grand Opera-house in
' Arrah N'a Pogue."' has been exceeding
ly fortunate. Miss Albertson's rise in
the theatrical profession has be<?n mar
velous and to-day she is regarded as
one of the cleverest leading women in
the country.
She is ca?t in the role of Arrah Na
Pogue. which gives her unusual oppor
tunities to display her merit, as the
character is one of action. Miss Albert
fcon is a San Francisco girl and studied
on tho stages of this city. She made
her dpbut at the Alcazar and from that
time hr<r ability has been recognized
and shÂ«Â» has ripen rapidly. O"Sulllvan
â¢will handle the roJ-e or Shaun, the Post,
in nrhldi he has scored many successes.
Several Eastern theatrical managers
had beÂ«Mi endeavoring to secure Miss
Albertson's services, and Liebler, one
of the bigr moguls of the managerial
r.<*ld. finally succeeded in getting her.
At the conclusion of her engagement
with O'Sullivan Miss Albertson will go
East and play a leading part with Wil
liam T. Hodge in a new piece, called
"Eighteen Miles From Home."
Bills for indigent books and portable
schoolhouses aggregating $7000 were ap
proved.
Leaves of absence were granted to M.
E. Mower. C. A. Maxwell, L. A. Ramas,
teachers In the department.
Numerous residents of Ingleslde peti
tioned that a schoolhouse be erected In
the district and the petition was taken
under advisement.
Mrs. Thomas Brennan was appointed
janitress of the Crocker school vice Mrs.
C. J. Lawton resigned, and Mrs. M. Mo-
Cullouerh was made assistant Janitress of
the Everett school . >' "
The board at j the meeting yesterday
authorized Director Boyle to rent four
rooms In connection with the Colum
bia Grammar - School, one room in con
nection with the Hearst Grammar school,
and to erect portable school houses to
be used for the accommodation of the
pupils attending the following named
schools: Lafayette Primary, 1; Spring
Valley Grammar, 1; Fremont Grammar,
1; Fairmount Grammar, 2; Washington
Grammar, 1; Garfleld Primary, 1; Rich
mond Grammar, 1; Dudley Stone Pri
mary, 1; Sutro Primary, 2.
Teachers' certificates were granted to
Misses Fannie Reed, Laura Perry, Kath
arine M. Hayes, Virginia Ryder, J. J.
Groom, Maude Whlgham, Retta Haynes,
Genevieve Nicholson, Tunil Aune, Jessie
B. Smith, Renee Scanlan, Grace Lyons,
Mary Galvln and Mary H. Mayberry.
The board assigned Misses Emily Grant,
Bonnie Wheeler and Margaret Strachan
from the substitute list to the Washing
ton, Dudley Stone and Columbia schools
respectively.
Roncovierl further said that there
was need of four new school r.ooms
in the Visitacion Valley District for
the John W. Taylor School, and that
a site should be purchased for the
same. Four rooms are also needed In
the Noe Valley District adjacent to
the James Lick School. The board rec
ommended a new site for â¢ the new
school at Twenty-seventh and Church
streets, which would be convenient for
the smaller children to attend.
Roncovieri figured that the total re
quirements to meet the overflow aggre
gate fifty-six new class rooms.'- Of
these forty-eight have already . been
provided, but thirty of these will. need
desks, blackboards and other school
equipment at an additional cost of $500
per room. The sum of $15,000 will have
to be expended for that purpose and
the board assured the Mayor that
everything would. be done to meet the
emergency, although the funds at com
mand are rather low. Roncovierl
agreed to submit a statement of the
financial condition of the school depart
ment. In the event that the emer
gency expenditures cannot be met with
the current funds an appeal will be
made to the Board of Supervisors to
provide for the deficiency.
The Mayor visited Spring Valley
School, where he found fifty-five pupils
being taught In the yard. In the
Fairmount School there were 100 chil
dren In one class, eighty-five in an
other and ninety pupils were being
taught in the yard.
INCREASING ACCOMMODATIONS. '
The Board of Education has announced
that the following school rooms will soon
be ready for occupancy: Ocean Side Pri
mary 1, completed; Washington Gram
mar 13. in course of erection; Crocker
Grammar 13. completed; Chinese School
2, completed.
President Roncovleri of the board in
formed the Mayor that the money for
the additional portable schools is be
ing taken "out of the general school
fund, as no separate appropriation had
been made by the Supervisors for fifty
portable school houses as requested by
the Board of Education. Roncovleri
stated that the current expenses would
be reduced to a' minimum In order to
afford facilities for pupils, as the State
apportionment depends on the number
of pupils in average daily attendance.
The Mayor' said he favored portable
school houses rather than rented rooms.
MORE ROOMS NEEDED.
Mayor Schmitz yesterday held a con
ference with the members of the Board
of Education relative to the steps be
ing taken to provide for the overflow
ing attendance of pupils in most of the
public schools. It was stated at the
outset that the conditions are the same
as prevail at the opening of every
school term, but heightened somewhat
by the rigid enforcement of the com
pulsory education law. The fact that
thirteen outside class rooms had .to be
provided for the Crocker Grammar
School pupils pending the building of
six additional rooms to the school on
Page street has rather confused mat
ters, although Principal Mark reported
that all pupils were, being cared for
in the rented auarters.
The Board of Education submitted a
list of portable schools that have been
erected and are in the course of com
pletion since the opening of the school
term on August 14. The list follows:
Lafayette . Primary 2, Monroe Pri
mary 1, Burnett Grammar 1, Park Pri
mary 2, Sutro Primary 2, Laguna Hon
da Primary 1, Bernal Grammar 1, Fre
mont Grammar 1. Fairmount Grammar
2, Spring 'Valley Grammer 1, Rich
mond Grammar 1, Lafayette Primary 1,
Columbia Grammar 1; Dudley Stone

Thousands of Women

Success of Lydia E. Pinkhara's Vegetable
Compeuad Rests Upon the Fact that It
Really Does Make Sick Women Wei!
- Thousands upon thousands of Ameri-
can women hare beep restored to
health by Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegeta-
ble Compound. Their letters are on file
In Mrs. Pinkham's office, and prove this
statement to be a fact and not a mere
boast.
Overshadowing indeed is the success
of this gTeat medicine, and compared
with it all other medicines and treat-
ment for women are experiments.
Why has Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound accomplished its wide-
tpread results for good ?
Why has it lived and thrived and
done its glorious work for a quarter of
a century ?
Simply and 6urely because of ita ster-
ling worth. The reason no other med-
icine has even approached its success
is plainly and positively because there
Is no other medicine in the world so
pood for women's ilia. â¢; - :-
The wonderful power of Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound over
the diseases of womankind is notbe-
canse it is a stimulant â not becauseit is
a palliative, but simply because it is
the most wonderful tonic and recon-
structor ever discovered to act directiy
upon the uterine Bystem. positively
cctbiko disease and displacements and
restoring health and vigor.
Marvelous cures are reported from
all parts of the country by women who
have been cured, trained nurses who
have witnessed cures, and physicians
who have recognized the virtue in
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound, and are fair enough to give
credit where it is due. If physicians
dared to be frank and open, hundreds
of them would acknowledge that they
constantly prescribe Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound in severe
cases of female ills, as they, know by
experience that it will effect a cure.
Women who are troubled with painful
or irregular menstruation, backache,
bloating (or flatulence), leucorrhoea,
falling, inflammation or ulceration of
the uterus, ovarian troubles, that
"bearing-down* feeling, dizziness,
faintness. indigestion, nervous pros-
tration, or the blues, should take im-
mediate action to ward off the serious
consequences and be restored to health
and strength by taking Lydia E.^Pink-

SEATTLE, Aug. 17.â The best played
game seen here this' season was .won
to-day by Los Angeles. Charley Hall
and Dolly Gray' both pitched gilt-edged
ball and there was nothing doing In
the scoring line until the eighth ; in
ning. With one" man down, Bernard
hit safely and. Flood beat out an
field â¢ tap to MoHale, which" a regular
second baseman would have converted
into an out. Smith drove a hard liner
to left that Houtz; could not catch, but
he blocked it and threw home to catch
the flying Bernard. The throw was
true, but the wet, grass held the ball j
back just enough to let Bernard slide J
over the plate.
With two men out in-jbhe seventh and
two men on the bases r Gray, purposely
walked Russ Hall to get Charley Hall
! up. Charley, had made a -fine hit" in
the third, ; but with a* chance.' to win
his own game he was too anxious and
struck out. Both teams . played -great
ball In the field, Russ Hall leading with
nine chances, j handled; perfectly. -Gray
was effective against the Jeft-handed j
hitters, striking Hart out three times.

PORTLAND, Aug. 17.â Hitt had control
of a bunch of curves , that were mysti
fying to the Giants yesterday. Although
the home team managed. to get two runs
they were . gifts from the Seals, as the
best the Giants could do with the stick
was two scratch hits.' Errors were fre
quent on both sides, but the Portlanders'
faults were costly and lost them the
game. Atz made the first run for j Port

Fully 1000 persons witnessed the unsuc
cessful attempts at aerial j navigation.
With the fifth trial Hamilton was car
ried into the air 100 feet. The machine
remained up for two or three minutes
and then began to turn from side to side.
The crowd looked with horror as they
saw the aeronaut attempting to right the
machine. Then of a sudden the big thing
careened with the wind and fell. As the
crowd rushed over, Hamilton pulled him
self out of the wreckage. He was unin
jured. . '
NEW* YORK, Aug. 17.â Israel Ludlow,
a lawyer, made five attempts to-day to
fly his dirigible, man-carrying kite. The
tests almost resulted in a tragedy.
Charles Hamilton, a Texas aeronaut,
whose father was killed in a similar ac
cident a number of years ago, .fell 100
feet with the big kite and emerged from
the wreckage beside the Hudson River
Railroad tracks unscathed.
"That was certainly a close call," said
Hamilton. '

TACOMA.
Hogan was getting: better as the con
teat was growing, while Thomas
seemed to have no effectiveness, and
Oakland was always getting men on
bases. They clinched the game a little
tighter .in the sixth by,, getting an
other run. They, made lt.a farce by
getting four: more in the' next round.
Cap Hogan and Graham seemed to have
paralysis of the hands in this ' round.
They felt all over themselves In trying:
to field a few. innocent bunts. The
bases were full with no one down when
the Red Dog kicked through with a
single; then Tacoma took an aerial as
cent, and before the parachute was cut
loose tho Commuters had four over the
pan. The score:
Oakland opened up their half of the
opening round with a rush, and before
the spectators had seated themselves
comfortably two runs were over the
pan. .Thomas allowed. Van Haltren, a
pass, and Kruger sampled one for a
two-sacker that skimmed along- the
kalsomlne line near third cushion. A
little Infield out brought in the "old
man." Kruger -followed Van's foot
steps when Kelly registered a safety.'
There was no more scoring until the
fourth, when Tacoma made its only
tally on three hits. It seemed Tacoma
might do something right there, but
Nordyke spoiled things by being
caught asleep on the midway station.
McLaughlin, who was at the'bat, would
have scored him as he found Hogan
for a single.' The following man died
easily.
Mike's men showed the fans they
can boot as well as other teams, and in
the seventh inning they gavo a high
class performance of how baseball
should not be played. A couple of er
rors and a few dinky infield' hits,
which should have been eaten up with a
little fast fielding, broke up the con
test.- ' ' ' ':'-.: \u25a0
- It was a sloppy exhibition of base
ball tlie Tigers dished out to the public
at Recreation Park yesterday, and Oak
land won an easy victory, notwith
lngr their patched up team. Bill
Thomas, who was on the firing, line
for Tacoma; was an easy'mark for'the
suburbanites, and they hit him at
pleasure. The score: Oakland,. 7; Ta

"Additional zrst is added to this fight,
as many people seem to think I will tire
before the end of the journey. I have
tested myself and I know just what 1
can do. Nelson is only human and If I
hit him on the nose it will bleed. If 1
hit him on the jaw he will go out like
any other man. 1 am his master and
1 am not settling down to training
trembling over what the outcome will be.
No fighter who depends entirely on brute
strength can beat me. I outclass Nelson
in every department of the game and 1
know I outclass him in gameness. I will
cut le-ose this time arul show the public
something they have never seen before.
I have been winning in the past by what
1 had 10, not by what I could. Some
people think I was forced into this
match. There was only one thing that
forced me into it and .that was the coin
I know I will win by beating Nelson."
Britt went across the bay with Nat
Goodwin, who went East sorrowfully. He
opens his season in New York on Sep
tember 6 and cays he would gladly give
up the receipts of the biggest week of
his engagement to see the fight.
Britt wasted no time In settling down
to work. He had a swim at the Olympic
Jiuimy Britt arrived from Truckee yes
terday morning, accompanied by Tiv
Kreliiig and 6am Berger. He was look
ing the best condition of his life. He said
t:e weighed about 142 pounds, which is a
desirable weight for him to enter upon
his three weeks' training. He was simply
bubbling ' over with confidence In his
ability to take the measure of Nelson
when" they meet in the ring.
Discussing the coming battle he said:
"The public has given me many tasks to
perform, each one apparently harder than
the other. The latest is this forty-five
round proposition with Nelson. I expect
to pass this safely and I hope they don't
want me to take on Jim Jeffries next.
There will be no trouble about a referee,
es any man Buitable to the general pub
lic will be acceptable to me. Every man I
ever fought picked tne referee. I have
no objection to an Eastern man, but he
must be impartial. There are a number
of writers in the East who have been
roasting me and I would not want one
of them to act on this occasion. The
fight will really referee Itself. This is to
be a battle to me death and I have su
preme confidence In my ability to defeat
Nelson.
CALIFORNIA* IS CONFIDENT.
W. H. Almon and James Casey pre
sented the Colma petition. After it had
been passed around for some time the
attention of Manager Coffroth was called
to the names of Theodore Koosevelt and
other distinguished men which appeared
en the list. He was asked if they were
registered voters of Colma. At first h<?
was at a lofs to reply until he found that
President Gallagher was the penman who
had slyly added the names.
BRITT ARRIVES IX TOW.V.
The Sacramento committee was made
up of AY. H. Hanlon, \V. J. Weisman and
T J. O'Brien. With them were Grand
President James Gallagher, Senator Kel
eon and W. J. Hynes.
The Supervisors are scattered through
out the Station their vacations and It
will require considerable effort to se
cure the signatures of the ten required
before the permit can be granted. The
proposition to hold the fight in this
city is an attractive one to the pro
moter, as it is estimated it would draw
possibly $15,000 more in this city than
it would across the county line. The
largest attendance ever recorded -at a
prizefight was that of the Jeffries-Cor
bett contest in Mechanics' * Paevllion,
which was witnessed by 10,000 spec
tators. (Sixty-two thousand dollars was
taken at the gate on this occasion. The
forthcoming fight is considered a bet
ter attraction and should draw a larger
attendance. The result of to-day's con
ference will be awaited with interest.
Manager Coffrcth was the center of
diplomatic negotiations yesterday. While
he was listening to the special representa
tives sent here by tne Native Sons at
Sacramento, the committee representing
Colma was ushered in. The representa
tives of the two localities were introduced
and later on discussfd the situation re
garding the postponement of the fight.
WOULD IIR.VW MOBE HERE.
The representatives of Sacramento
undertook to secure a permit from the
Supervisors of this city â the under
standing being that the fight be post
poned to some night during the week
following September !>. The only
money Manager Coffroth has spent up
to the present time on "the Colma fight
has been for plans of the arena, so he
would be out but little money on that
end of the affair. With the permit for
a fig-ht in this city he would be in a
particularly strong position.
He has Mechanics' Pavilion under
lease and he has paid into the city
treasury the $1200 license fee exacted
lor it light permit. He would have to
make no change in the number of
rounds of the fight, as the manager of
another fighting club, who looked into
the matter, announced recently that
it would be possible to pro
mote contests of more than
twenty rounds in this city. The
various angles of the question will be
thrashed out this morning at 11 o'clock
in the office of Mayor Schmitz. The
meeting i,s held at the request of the
Native Sons. Manager Coffroth not put
tins himself in the position of a sup
plicant for favors at the" hands of the
city fathers.
With the coming of the special com
mittee appointed by the Native Sons at
Sacramento to secure the postponement
of the proposed Britt-Xelson fight came
a sudden and a sensational turn yes
terday in the negotiations which have
been in progress for some days between
Manager James Coffroth and represen
tatives of the State order. The repre
sentatives of Sacramento did not come
with empty liands to plead for favors
from the fight promoter. They had a
proposition to offer which would in
sure him greater returns from the af
fair which he is about to promote, and,
if the plans do not miscarry, a triumph
over his enemies who have been suf
ficiently powerful to keep him out of
the game in this city since the first of
the year.

SARATOGA, Aug. 17.â 1t. was the usual
mid-week card to-day with the exception
of the Saratoga Derby.
Cairngorm won the Derby, but it was
only by a narrow margin. Glen Echo
giving him an \u25a0argument in the final run.
Cairngorm ' was much the best Â»orse, as
he bolted twice during the running.
He first went out on the. paddock turn
and carried Glen Echo and Merry Lark
with him. This let Yon Tromp into the
lead, for a moment, but he was soon
joined by Cairngorm and the two ran
locked for the next half mile. At the
turn for home Cairngorm ran out again
and let Glen Echo on the inside. The
latter gaining about four lengths on the
favorite. Cairngorm ' was much the
stronger in the run home and managed to
\u25a0win by a head. Summary:

RESULTS OF GAMES.
Special Dispatch lo ThÂ» CalL
BUFFALO, â¢N. T., Aug. 17.â At least
two horses that did not win at Fort Erie
to-day should have won. One was Birm
ingham in the second race and the other
was Cheripe in the third. Jockey Shea
had the mount on Birmingham in the
second and it was . owing to his stupid
ity that the^ colt did not win, as he was
the best engaged (in the race.
"When the field broke for the start he
took his ' mount up and was practically
left. He woke up too late and hustled
him along and managed to land In sec
ond place. â¢
In the third race it looked as if Cheripe
was a sure winner. As ttoe field neared
the turn for home and coming Into the
stretch he held a lead, but was carried
wide -, by Annie Alone, ridden by Obert.
Scalper took advantage of the circum
stance and won by half a length. Obert

FIGHT MAY TAKE PLACE IN THIS CITY
EDITED BY
R. A. SMYTH
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,; FRIDAY. AUGUST 18; 1905.
The public which follows boxing has set task after task for
me to perform, and I have not failed up to the present
time. lam now asked to go forty-five rounds, and when
I prove I am Nelson's master at this game I hope I will
be accorded the credit due me. I will show the public
something this time. In the past I have been winning by
what I had to and not by what I could, and there are but
few people who know the measure of my ability. Nelson
is only flesh and blood, like any other human being, and he
can be hurt. No fighter whose entire stock in trade is
brute strength can ever defeat me. I know I outclass
Nelson as a boxer and a defensive fighter, and I outclass
him in sheer gameness. , The fact that the fight is scheduled
to go forty-five rounds has added zest to the affair, asthere

CRUISER CHICAGO ON REEF OFF ANGEL, ISLAND. THE ILL-FATED BEN
NINGTON. WHICH THE CRUISER WAS TOWING TO MARE ISLAND AT THE
TIME.. AND TUG FORTUNE, WHICH HAULED THE WARSHIPS OFF ROCKS.
The Bennington looked little the worse
for the terrible experience she had been
through in San Diego. Her hull was
painted a bright white, and her decks
looked as clean as pumice stone could
make them. On board were the surviving
members of her crew. They were grouped
about the deck, and seemed to be tnank
ful that they had been spared the awful
fate of bo many of their companions.
As soon as the Chicago had steamed
away the tug Fortune attached a long
chain to the bow of the Bennington, and
the tug Sotoyome made fast to the Ben
nington's starboard side and began to
tow her through the Raccoon straits up
the bay to Mare Island.
Captain Moore reports that the trip up
the coast was uneventful. The weather
was pleasant up to Wednesday, when
they ran into a heavy fog. The Chicago
steamed eight miles an hour on the
trip up. . ' : *
An immediate response was received
from Yerba Buena that the tugs would
be sent. In the meantime the Fortune
had stretched a long hawser to the Ch.
cago, and, as the tide was rising, under
her own steam and with the Fortune's
assistance the Chicago was easily pulled
off the reef. As she slid away the heavy
breeze and the strong current carried her
up against the prow of the Bennington,
with the result that a seam . was started
in the Chicago's starboard side, letting
the water into one of her compartments
\u25a0which contained ship's stores. A collision
mat was thrown over the damaged plate,
and the flow of water stopped. In the
meantime the Chicago had been pulled
out into the stream, and under her own
steam proceeded to her anchorage.
The damaged plates will be adjusted the
first thing this morning by the crew on
the ship. Later in the day she will go
up to Mare Island, where she will be
docked to see if there is any damage to
her keel. In response to Captain Moore's
appeal for assistance the tugs Defiance.
Relief and Slocum went to the scene, but
they arrived after the Chicago was pulled
off.
The Chicago arrived off this port early
yesterday morning, but as there was a
heavy fog off the bar she waited until 11
t'clock before she passed in. With her
tow and convoy, the Chicago steamed
fclowiy through the Golden Gate, and
passed up the bay between Alcatraz and
Angel islands on her way through Rac
coon straits to Mare Island. When the
Chicago was nearing Point Xnox, Cap
tain E. K. Moore orderea the vessel
stopped, so a boat could be lowered to
take dispatches and letters ashore for
Washington, D. C. At this time there
was a heavy wind, and a strong flood
tide was running which had been slowly
carrying the Chicago and the Bennington
toward the west shore of Angel Island.
After the boat had been lowered, Captain
Moore ordered the Chicago ahead under
slow steam. She had only got under way
when the suddenly stopped, having run on
a projecting reef. She was at this time
about 500 yards from the shore. As soon
as she hit the reef the engines were
stopped. The Bennington crew saw the
plight the Chicago was in, and at once
uropped anchor. Captain Moore signaled
the Fortune to come alongside and make
fast to a line from, the Chicago's stem.
At the same time he sent a wireless tele
graph to Yerba Buena, asking the depart
ment there to send two powerful tugs to
the Chicago's assistance.
The United States cruiser Chicago, flag
ship of the Pacific squadron and about
the only war vessel on this station that
â¢v.-as not suffering tome morÂ» or Jess seri
ous disability, yesterday joined the ranks
of the candidates lor the repair shop.
She first poked her nose into a corral
of rocks on the Angel Island beach, and
when, an hour later, she was pulled into
deep water by the navy tug Fortune, she
collided with the Benaington. The Chi
cago is thought to have escaped serious
carnage from tht rocks, but in the col
lision one of her plates was started and
H was with her forward bulkheads closed
and a mat over the dent in her side
that the leaking rlagship came to an an
chor off Clay-street wharf.
The Chicago had been ordered to San
Diego to bring up to Mare Island Navy
Yard the ill-fated Bennington. With the
Benuington in tow, the Cnicago left San
Diego Monday afttrnoon. The tug For
tune acted as convoy.
T. J. Ford, superintendent of mails,
places the blame upon the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company for sending the
steamship Siberia away last Wednesday
without waiting for 250 pieces of mall that
were left behind. Mr. Ford reported to
Postmaster Flsk yesterday that by the
terms of the contract existing between
the United States and the steamship com
pany it is the duty of the company to
call for the mail at the door of the post
offlce and to convey it thence to their
ships. He says that the mall was all
ready for delivery at~lo a. m.. but that
the steamship company did not send
enough wagons to take It away In time,
the two last wagons sent for the remain
ing 230 pieces leaving . the postofflce at
12:57 p. m. and 1:07 p. m.
The Siberia took away 426 packages of
mail. Of the 250 packages left behind ami
returned to the postofflce, 42 pouches and
41 sacks were destined for Manila, 39
pouches and 10 sacks for Honolulu. 21
sacks for United States warships of the
Asiatic fleet and 97 sacks for China and
Japan, making a total or 8l pouches and
169 sacks. Most of the local registered
mail was left behind. The 428 pieces sent
on were unaccompanied by letter bills,
and the bills of lading for 8000 tons of
cargo were also left behind. Section 1G27
of the Revised Statutes declares it to be
a misdemeanor for any mall contractor to
refuse or. neglect to perform service un
der the contract, and prescribes a punish
ment of a fine, of not exceeding $5000. or
imprisonment not exceeding 12 months.

CRUISER CHICAGO GOES ASHORE OFF ANGEL ISLAND
WRECKERS FIND
SECRET PASSAGE
FORD BLAMES
THE COMPANY
THE SAN â¢ FRANCISCO CAT X, FRIDAY. AUGUST â¢ IS, 1905.
NEW YORK. Aug. 17. â Subterranean
passages, leading from a secret stair
case to stone-vaulted chambers beneath
the old Tilden mansion in Gramercy
Park have been brought to light by the
contractors engaged in tearing out and
remodeling the structure, which is now
under course of transformation into a
home for the National Arts Club. Many
other peculiarities exist in the mansion,
which must have been the conception
of Samuel J.'Tilden himself, and which
have remained' undiscovered up to this
day. although tne famous old dwelling
has housed many tenants since his re
moval to Greystone in 1879, where he
died in August. 1886.
There is a legend among the old
time residents of the neighborhood that
Tilden, who roused a host of enemies
by the part he took in the exposure of
the Tweed ring, had a fear of secret
assassination, and builded his house
accordingly.
The interior of the mansion was a
work of art in its day, and is scarcely
erqualed In some respects even now by
the palaces of Upper Fifth avenue. In
the work of remodeling now under way
the secret staircases and underground
passages were discovered. As the
builders, like Tilde.n, long since joined
their fathers, no explanation can be
given for the mysterious passages
other than that mentioned by old
neighbors. , :
It, was found that the building had
three roofs instead of one. and that a
tiny staircase led to a secret passage
from the second floor. Entrance to it
was, gained by pressing 'a knob on . a
beautltully carved walnut panel.
In the cellar a puzzling .^labyrinth of
vaults and passages was found leading
to a bricked tunnel, the walls of which
are covered with mold, but which was
otherwise perfectly dry. The tunnel.
as: far as it could be explored, led
straight south from the mansion, but
its terminus had been closed for many
years and the air was found so bad
that the wreckers had not ventured
more than twenty-five feet into .the
passage.
STEWARD THROWS HER
JEWELRY OVERBOARD
Omaha Woman Loses Valu
able Kings on the
Ocean.
Mrs. L. Macmahon~of Omaha, Nebraska,
had a very fine collection of jewelry when
she left Portland on the steamer Colum
bia for this city. The Columbia arrived
yesterday. Mrs. MacMahon was on
beard, but without her jewelry, which by
this time is probably distributed among
Neptune's favorite mermaids.
-To the harbor police Mrs. [MacMahon
explained that she had lert her rings and
other jewelry wrapped in tissue paper, in
the porthole of her stateroom. "On the
window-sill." s.ie called it. John Wills, a
bedroom steward, put the "stateroom in
order. When he went to dust off the
porthole, he grabbed- the bundle of tissue
paper on the ledge and threw it over
board. Wills was arrested, but told a
story so reasonable and with such appar
ent sincerity tnat even the police believed
him. ;
On the chance that some fish might
swallow a ring- or two and later bring the
treasure to this market, Mrs. MacMahon,
who left for Los Angeles on the morning
train, gave the police a description of
what she had lost. They were all pres
ents, she said and she Is unable to esti
mate their value. The tissue paper held:
One pin. set with four diamonds and five
turquoises; four diamond rings, one tur
quoise ring, with eight diamonds' in it:
one solitaire ring: one ring with three
diamonds set across: one ring set with
a dark blue stone and one diamond, and
one amber ring.

NEW YORK, Aug. 17. â On weak cables the
market started easy. Trading was active, the
bears being: aggressive sellers on the call.
On the other hand there was heavy buying
of a very good character and all offerings wero
well absorbed. Shorts became frightened and
ran to cover and urices rushed up some 22
points. There was a report that a bull pool
had been formed and was buying cotton. It
is only a question of time when supply and
demand will govern prices,., regardless â¢ of
manipulation. The market i-s heavily over
soli with an enormous short interest in the
Lands of a few operators. Crop conditions
are ' the most * unfavorable for the season, if

NEW YORK. Aug. 17â Nearly hall a mil
lion shares or stocks were said to-daj- In the
tiret hour's dealings on the Stock Exchange.
The transactions of the first hour are the most
significant of the day and are the crucial test
of the tone of the market in the majority of
cases. The extreme animation during that
period of to-day was convincing evidence of
the growth of speculative Interest. Large
orders came from various quarters. Every de
vice was used to make the opening prioes high
for the benefit of those -who desired to realize
profits with the advantage of the growing out
side demand. The accumulated buying de
mand was fed steadily during the whole of the
first hour in the process of realizing profits.
The result was a growing tendency to yield
which became more marked as the accumu
lated buying orders were worked off. But
when this condition of affairs began to be
evident there was a discontinuance of the
pressure to spII which threw the market of the
middle portion of the day Into dullness. The
absorptive power demonstrated while the sell-
Jr.g- was active served to encourage professional
speculative sentiment to Â«uch an extent that
<-ffcrts were resumed later In the day to get
prices up again, advantage thus being secured
also for the renewal of profit talcing sales with
the next day's accumulation of new buying
ordure. This has been Â«.bout the course of the
market for. several days with some variations
:n the effect relatively in the profit taking
Rale* and the new buying orders. Immediate
new events were of little consequence in the
market and nothing important occurred. In
'act. to change the general conditions existing.
Each day's news adds to the confidence in the
prosperous outcome of the grain crops, and
the grain carriers held their conspicuous place
in the day's market. Stocks of Eastern rail
roads were notably held back by the pressure
to reaiiie. Reading being the conspicuous ex
ample, although that stock touched a new high
record during its period of strength. So did
th* .Erie, which was the etrong exception In
the group. Union Pacific was again very con
spicuous and was the subject of the most
taifcf-d of deals and mysterious developments.
These rumors have taken the form of some
important development regarding Great North
â¢y preferred, from which it is said the ex
"Â£> ted benefit to Union Pacific will accrue, by
nrsjon of it? large holdings of Great Northern.
The enthusiastic forecast* of the corn crop
helped Missouri Pacific to an additional ad
vance. A special farter In the Southern group
was the belief that the yellow fever epidemic
in New Orleans has come under control. The
j-*ace conference at Portsmouth wu the sub
ject of attentive consideration under the belief
that -the critical stage of the negotiations had
arrived. All- signs continued to point to. a
fc-elir.g of confidence !n the financial world and
a peaceful outcome of the conference and pcs-
Fimistie utterances from diplomatic quarters
K^RifS to "have no power to alter this feeling.
The favorable condition reported by the trade
authority In the iron and steel industry had
.'ts effect 'on the stock of ..companies connected
with various branches of that industry. There
\u25a0was some epÂ»ciai activity in the Republic
Pteel Ftocks Induced by discussion of the pos
sible resumption *>f dividends -on the preferred
stock. The extra dividend on United States
Reduction and Refining explained the advanced
stocks of that company. Reports that the oft
projected lead merger was again abandoned
depressed National l*aA and had come effect
als"} on American Smelting. The money mar
ket continued easy and therefore received at
tÂ»r.tlcn la tbÂ« stock market. The digestive
process continued up to the cloee. which was
made Irregular by the beavy profit talcing In
forÂ» stock* and the late rise of about a point
in the United States Steel stocks and some
others.

struction and operation of the municipal rail
road on' Geary, street."- -we would say that at
the time the 'budget waa under consideration
the . members of the ' Finance Committee gave
the most \u25a0 serious and earnest attention to , all
matfys relating to the actual construction of
the Geary-street â¢ road and the procedures nec
essary "that â¢ the construction 'under municipal
ownership 'might conform to the requirements
Of the law. The members of this committee
studied ' carefully- .the reports -of the â¢ former
City Engineer, C. E. Grunsky, and questioned
.the; well-known engineer, Mr. Stut, in refer
ence to all details of construction - and opera
tion.' - This : Investigation - showed that ' the
present roadbed is : In good condition. - The
; rails are similar to those on, Turk street, upon
which .' now - run ' the - heavy cars of > the Turk
and ..Eddy street' line. . Mr. , Stut emphasized
the fact : that In the exercise of a reasonable
economy ..the present rails should' be continued
for; four 'or -five years and 'could then be re
placed -by - a grooved rail of . a pattern which
has been devised especially for roads on which
the", motive power Is changed . from,; cable 'to

'design and has: been generally used In Eastern

tric, and Is of such depth that It can be
placed upon . : the present ties.
\u25a0If the opinions of Mr. : Grunsky. and Mr. Stut
are* -of." any. value the: Finance Committee -is
Justified :In believing i that \u25a0 a first-class road
can ; be constructed >If â¢_ the \u25a0 plans heretofore

FILE OBJECTION
TO NEW PLANS
Mrs. 'W. W. Btephenson, whose hus-
6o as Joseph Gerson he was registered,
Â»nd when his case was assigned to Judge
Conlan's department of the Police Court
that appellation was entered on the cal
endar. But with evaporation of the al
coholic Influence that led to his incar
ceration there faded remembrance of his
norn de bastile. and his mind was mani
festly perturbed as he sat among the
prisoners awaiting the magistrate's ar
rival. His visible attire consisted of a
soiled green sweater, dun-colored over
alls and ramshackle Bhoes of similar hue,
j although originally black. Upon his
knees rested his elbows, and his bands
supported a heavily-stubbled chin. His
shock hair and thick eyebrows were fiery
red, and from the caverns under the lat
ter glinted ferrety eyes.
Now "Joseph Gerson" was No. 7 on the
morning calendar, but as each name pre
ceding it was called in turn the man in
the green sweater glanced eagerly at his
fellow-mlserables. and If cne of them
did not instantly respond he shouted,
"Here!" leaped to his feet and stood ready
to be Ud forth for trlaL Thrice had he
repeated the performance, and thrice had
another misdemeanant turned out to be
the genuine owner of the name called,
when he was placed before the bench as
"Frank Nealon," accused of peace dis
turbance.
â¢That ain't the man I arrested." said
the uniformed captor of Frank Nealon,
and the green sweater was thrust back
Into the cage and the real Frank Nealon
rebuked for his tardiness in acknowledg
ing the bailiff's summons.
Then the man In the green sweater
evidently decided to let fate have its
fling, for he did not again shout "Here!"
not even when "Joseph Gerson" was
called, and the court was in confusion,
logically Imagining that a prisoner had
escaped, when the policeman who had
escorted the green sweater to Jail pointed
at its wearer and said he was the man
who had registered as Joseph Gerson. So
the emerald body garment was again
Jerked from the cage and set before his
Honor.
'"What do you mean by giving us all ,
this trouble?" was the magisterial in- 1
Qulry, sharply delivered.
The defendant explained how his mem
ory bad played him false, and added that
not for untold wealth would ho disclose
the name bestowed upon him by his fore
bears, because he was a "remittance
roan** of English birth, and why should
he bring shame upon his proud relatives,
to say nothing of provoking a stoppage of
hit pecuniary income?
"TPlth such a sturdy spirit to sustain
jroTi," remarked the Judge, "the sixty
days which you are to spend in prison
will- hardly seem like punishment."
But the man In the green sweater did
net- appear to relish his sentence.
He was arrested for being drunk In a
public placeâ the same being the Inter
section of Sacramento and Kearny streets
âand he hiccoughed "Joseph Oerson" In
response to the booking sergeant's re
quest for his name.
"Are you sure of that?" the wise officer
Queried- - ' -'\u25a0 \u25a0 ' * <"-;' '
"Bure'B yer (hlc) bom." was the re-
Ply.
Now the man ' who . manages the cafe
plumes himself on his ability to serve
oysters and clams and crabs and shrimps
In a way that no rival has yet succeeded
in emulating, ana he makes no secret of
the fact that his 'success In that respect
is chiefly attributable to his retention of
life in the bivalves and crustaceans until
they are subjected to culinary treatment.
Thus it happened that when' Bernard
Smith's arm entered the window his hand
followed it and his thumb was 'instantly
seized between the nippers' of a gigantic
crab with much vitality and .tenacity of
purpose. It evidently accepted Mr.
Smith's thumb a? a .tid-bit providentially
provided," for all the strength of Its be
ing was cast into the grip. and his efforts
Bernard Smith was in mirthful mood,
superinduced by alcoholic absorption,
when he met a soldier in front of a cafe
on Powell street, close to O'Farrell, and
slapped his khaki-covered shoulder with
a spatulous hand and told him . to cheer
up, as though the; cherry, season had
lapsed, "prunes are ripe" and apples will
soon be fit for market," Not being ac
auainted with Mr. Smith, and resenting
his show of familiarity as unwarranted,
the soldier pushed him away and one of
his (Mr. Smith's) arms crashed through
the cafe window.
It was just after he had vainly en
deavored to coax his wife from the in
fluence of the Hitchcocks that Mr. New
bert was arrested for battering the
complainant. She and Mrs. Newbert
were walking on Valencia street when
Mr.. Newbert accosted them, and he
says that Mrs. Hitchcock struck him
with a heovy scantling, while Mrs.
Hitchcock swears that, he struck her
down without having received provoca
tion or given warning.
Mrs. Newbert was in court and might
have disclosed whether it was her hus
band or Mrs. Hitchcock who prevari
cated, but as a wife is not permitted by
law to testify against her husband, the
young woman was not called to the
stand and without hearing any further
testimony Judge Fritz pronounced Mr.
Newbert guilty of battery and re
manded him for sentence to-morrow,
with bail fixed at $500.
Several ladles who had waited sev
eral hours in . expectation of being
summoned to testify were deeply dis
appointed, and one of them, a buxom
matron, dressed in blue, urged Mrs.
Hitchcock to get the case reopened,
which Mrs. \u25a0 Hitchcock futilely en
deavored to do. When the bench's final
decision was announced the lady in
blue waxed volubly indignant and
with nose In the air swept from the
tribunal, followed by the other ladies,
who had been deprived, of opportunity
to tell the Judge what they thought of
Mr. Newbert's conduct.
After denying Mrs. Louise Hitch
cock's charge that he had blackened
her left eye by deliberately punching
it with his right first, Frank Newbert
declared she certainly was deserving of
punishment at his bands, inasumch as
she had aided and abetted her son In
persuading his (Mr. Newbert's) young
wife to desert and remain away from
him. Mrs. Hitchcock's son, Mr. New
bert asseverated, was madly in love
with Mrs. Newbert.

mour, Chlllion Bowen, .was released on
her own recognizance to appear when
wanted to testify at the slayer's trial.
She told Judge Fritz that she did not in
tend to leave San Francisco, and Attor
ney Walter Gallagher said he would be
\u25a0responsible for her appearance at any
time on two hours' notice.
â¢ Judge Fritz . continued for. two weeks
the case of W." F. Hopkins, charged with
having attempted to murder. James - Mc-
Glnley by stabbing him repeatedly . with
a- knife. McGlnley's slashed; and : blood
stalned clothes were introduced as evi
dence of the felony.- The continuance
was ordered to' afford the -prosecution
opportunity to present the testimony.of

"What did he get. the thirty days for?
Oh,", while my sister was being -married
he stood on the street and threw rocks
through the parlor windows and' scared
the wedding party awfully. ' 'â¢< . .
"What started him \ to breaking the
furniture after he got out of. jail? Oh,
we had some friends to dinner and
when he came home- drunk he said he
was not good, enough to mix .with our
company. ' Then he upset the table 'and
smashed all the dishes and \u25a0 grabbed a
water pitcher and skipped behind \u25a0 the
door, so that he could hit' me with the
pitcher if I attempted tog o outto call
the police. I eluded him, however, and
when he found I was gone he was so
mad that . he Just started to break
everything in the parlor.
"Whafdid he break? Oh, he smashed
an exquisite piano and he broke some
grand vases and he shattered a splen
did, mirror and he just ruined*.every
thing he could lay his hands on.''
As his daughter Inventoried the dam
age done by Mr., Solomon he ; smiled
fatuously arid then told the court -of
the. good time afforded him by'accom
plishing- the demolition. ' -\u25a0 l "

added, "and go to Portland, for they tell
me that the fair is worth traveling ' the
distance to see." , â¢ â '. .
"After you have served six months for
malicious mischief," was the Judge's re
sponse, "you will be brought before ' me
again and sentenced for "haying " threat
ened your â¢ daughter's life." â¢ : '
Whereupon the daughter and- her moth
er began weeping and the defendant smil
ingly returned to the cage.. He is a deal

Just before he was sentenced to six
months' . imprisonment . for . \ haying
smashed furniture and ornaments in
his home on Twenty-ninth street,' lsaac
Solomon declared , he; was "having the
time of his life" when a policeman in
considerately stayed his .vandal hand
and placed him under arrest. His good
looking daughter. Florence", '. on whose
complaint the arrest was made, also in
formed Judge Conlan thatr her -father's
destructive exercise was evident en
joyed by him, as he howled delightfully
during his performance.
"He had served a thirty days' sen
tence given him by JudgeJMogan," Miss
Florence testified, "and *no ' sooner did
he get out j of jail than he resumed
drinking and making our lives-miser
able. , '
It may not be amiss to add, that the
soldier who pushed Mr. Smith against
the window ungallantly disappeared when
the crab began . to gnaw the thumb.
JJr. \u25a0 Smith was , yelling frantically, â¢ with
the .crab dangling from his thumb, | when
Patrolman Harry Hook heard the outcry
and went to j the rescue. \u25a0 I He \u25a0" succeeded
In parting . the ] nippers and releasing the
thumb, which was. considerably .lacerated,
and then, on complaint of the^ indignant
restaurateur, who fondled the- recovered
crab, arrested Mr." Smith and booked him
for committing malicious mischief. When
the circumstances, were explained'/ to
Judge Fritz, however, and Mr. Smith had
promised to pay for- the broken window,
the case was dismissed. ' '
to shake it loose were unavailing.

Harry B. Kernan, who is under ar
rest in Oakland on three charges .of
burglary," has: confessed to Detectives
Bunner and Freer of this city that he
was the burglar who has been operat
ing in private hotels and apartment
houses here fprsome months past. ' He
had been living at the Lochearn House,
712 Van Ness avenue, with Miss Frances
Birch, who : passed as his wife. On his
cards he calls himself a sketch artist
and' vocalist. He had a room 'also at
the Pierpont, 450 Ellis street. : :'
'\u25a0.. Bunner. and Freel- visited the room
occupied 'by. Miss Birch at the Lochearn
and she admitted that Kernan had given
her . many ; presents of jewelry. ,\ In his
room at the Pierpont they '\u25a0 found sev
eral; revolvers, cartridges, a dark lan
tern, skeleton keys and a large quan-'
tity of broken jewelry, worka .of
watches, manicure sets and .brushes
with, the silver backs torn off and a
gold match j box.
Kernan began operations here about
six month* ago. The" first place he vis
ited, was che Kenilworth at* 698 Bush
street. ' He paid a second visit to the
Kenilworth on August 9 and stole a
quantity/ of jewelry from the room of
R. H. .Winston. On the same day he
visited . the Chesterfield at 637 Bush
street and - stole a large quantity of
jewelry from the room of R. S*' Smith.'
A ; revolver,; and a watch, which were
among the articles stolen from Smith,
were found in -Kernan's room. !
Among.other places? visited- by, Ker
nan â¢ as far as -he could recollect were
the Holland, 1007 Bush street; the Ains-.
worth. Post â¢ and Polk streets; the St.
Cecile, 115 Fell street; the St. Kathryn,'
Ellis and . Leavenworth' streets; an
apartment-blouse at 607 Turk' street and
another in the 300 block on Ellis
street. These .were all he icould. re
member, but he thought -there -were
others. , :/â:
.Kernan. has a previous record. He
started out as a bicycle thief while em
ployed in the Cleveland Cyclery and
on February 18, 1901, was sentenced
to serve four months in the County
Jail for petty larceny. On March 2,
1902, & was sentenced to serve nine
months! being three months on each
of thre*e charges of petty larceny.
. A letter was found in his pocket
which he - hadÂ» written to Miss Birch
after his arrest in Oakland. He begged
her forgiveness and implored her to be
true to him no matter what the conse
quences might be. It was for love of
her that. he. had become "a burglar, &t>
he I wanted to provide,: her with every
comfort,' he said.
