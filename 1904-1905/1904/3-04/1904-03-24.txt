IX THE SIXGLETOX CASE
The defendant and his wife, are the
principal remaining witnesses for the
defense. The prosecution claims to
have a strong case in rebuttal.
Stephens swore that he was sitting
in the seat with Armstrong when the
latter was shot by Gostlin. Warner
testified that the location of the hom
icide was in -T'acer County. L. L.
Chamberlain for the defense made a
lengthy statement, in which he said
his side would prove that the act was
due to temporary insanity superin
duced by family troubles and mining
litigation.
During the afternoon Miss Gostlin
was put on the stand and swore that
Armstrong, had made insulting re
marks to her. Her testimony was not
shaken by' the cross-examination.
Many witnesses throughout the county
testified to Gostlin's good character.
AUBURN, March 23. â The trial of

LOSS OF LIFE IMPROBABLE.
Communication with the island di

available since the Napa City left, hut
at midnight or thereabout the regular
river steamers are scheduled to pass.
It is not thought that any lives were
lost, us the island is so large that even
with a ri'.-er pouring In it would fill
slowly. This island contains the cele
brated asparagus canneries and fields,
and it is not likely that much of the
crop v.ill be saved, as the draining of
the island will be very slow.
The pressure came from the Mokel
umn<? tide, and the break would nat
urally occur there. The strain along
the San Joaquin has not been heavy.
but the levels there may be taken in
the rear, and the amount of damage
possible can only be conjectured at this
time.

On a recent Sunday an excursion
eteamer went down along the Island
to show a party of citizens the sub
merged country just across the river
from the Bouldin levees. The launches
that were moving: uÂ» and down
along the levees were at once alert,
â¢ -a one ran out with a warning to the
pilot to keep on the other side of the
river lest the waves from the paddle
wheel run in against the levees and
wash their tops. A constant guard
was maintained on water and on land,
but the great torrent escaping from
the Sacramento ttirough the Edwards
break and the rising of the river have
proved too much, and the fight of
ve*ks has been lost.
The fight to save Bouldin Island has
been one of the most remarkable in
the history cf the reclaimed lands.
"When the water came down at the
first of the month it rose steadily until
it lapped the topmost rims of the
levees. Hundreds of guards patrolled
the embankments day and night and
not a move of aggression did the wa

resistance and check.
FAILURE ENDS LONG VIGIL.
The first authentic and confirmatory
rews that the island was gone reached
here this evening from Woodard, a
Santa Fe station on Middle River, at
which place the steamer Napa City ar

about 4 o'clock this afternoon, bringing
away considerable produce pgid. a num

telephone this evening he told The Call

RIVERSIDE.March 23.â The affairs
of the Orange Growers' National Bank
were taken in charge this morning by
National Bank Examiner J. W. Wj*t
son, who was appointed receiver by
the Comptroller of Currency. He inti
mated that no statement would be
given out until a thorough examina
tion of all books can be made. The
directors state positively that the bank
is perfectly solvent. Hays' defalca
tions have already been made up by
the stockholders, and are said to have
amounted to about $100,000. . -
At 4 o'clock this morning Hays ap
peared at the Country Club and knocked
for admission. He was. drenched with
rain and spattered with mud from head
to foot. He told the attendant that he
had been to Elsinore on a hunting trip.
He called for the daily papers, and af
ter glancing through them said that
this was the first he knew that a search
was being made for him by officers of
the law and that he would immediately
surrender. . Hays then went to bed.
and upon awakening later in the day
caused a telephone message to be sent
to Sheriff Coburn announcing his will
ingness to submit to arrest.
Judge Noyes' courtroom was crowded
to-night, when Hays was arraigned.
Political, social and business friends
of-the defendant were there in force,
and the dramatic feature of the scene
was that practically all of the court
officers, from bench to bailiff, were per
sonal friends of the accused.
RIVERSIDE. March 23.â H. T.
Hays, politician, and former cashier
of the Orange Growers' National Bank
of Riverside, is no longer a fugitive
from justice. This afternoon by tele
phone he notified Sheriff Coburn of
Riverside County of his presence in
Riverside and at 8:30 o'clock this even
ing he quietly submitted to arrest at
the Country Club in this city.
The warrant on which Hays was
taken into custody charges felony em
bezzlement. There are /our -charges
as follows: Embezzlement on October
3, 1903, of J5000; embezzlement on Oc
tober 9, 1902, of $3000; embezzlement on
October 8, 1902, of $3000 and embezzle
ment on August 4, 1903, of $5000. The
prisoner is charged with having, on
each of the mentioned dates, raised
the bank's total checks for the day and
abstracted in cash sufficient to balance
the peculations.
Hays expressed a desire for an im
mediate hearing and to-night he was
taken before Judge Noyes of the Su
perior Court and arraigned. He plead
ed not guilty. M. J. Twogood. who suc
ceeded Hays as cashier of the Orange
Growers'- National Bank, was placed oh
the stand by the prosecution and tea-;
tifled in .support of the four. counts.
The defendant was offered the stand,
but declined to give testimony In his
own defense, at this time. . -
Judge Noyes said that the evidence
appearing to Justify the presumption of
guilt, he would hold Hays in the sum
of $10,000. on each count, or $40,000 bail
in total, and intimated that proper bond
in the sum of $80,000 would be accepted
for Hays f freedom.
Since then Shakir Pasha, with a large
force, has been parleying with the rev
olutionists, under instructions from the
Porte, which is desirous of settling the
Albanian movement eo as/ to avoid
complications while negotiating with
Bulgaria and in face of the continued
troubles in Macedonia. The. dilatory
tactics of Shakir Pasha are reported to
haveiemboldened the Albanian revolu
tionises, who, according to information
contafced in the dispatches, have been
massing at various points, and it would
appear from the Salonica dispatch re
ceived to-day, which was the first re
port of any considerable assembling of
the insurrectionists, that Shakir Pasha
is continuing the negotiations looking
to a settlement, and that the dispatch
of reinforcements may be intended as
a demonstration in force, with the ob
ject of securing a final acceptance of
his terms. Â» , --
LONDON, March 23.â The announce
ment from Salonica on March 3 that
the Albanian revolt had been sup
pressed was, it appears, somewhat pre
mature. It originated from Turkish
sources, where it was believed that the
acceptance of the offer of the exemp
tion from the cattle tax at Ipk, Alba
nia, would satisfy the Albanians. New
evfdences of a determined revolution
ary movement were reported from
Mitrovitza on March 4 and March 9,
and it was announced at Constantinople
that the Albanians had increased their
demands, refusing to recognize the re
form scheme of the powers and de
manding the withdrawal of the new
taxes, the abolition of the new civil
tribunals, exemption from military ser
vice outside of their own provinces and
the pardon of Hassan Bey, the revolu
tionist, who was exiled in 1903.
SALONICA, Macedonia, March 23.â
Twelve battalions of Turkish troops,
commanded by Shakir Pasha, have sur
rounded 10,000 Albanians at Babatepe.
Shakir Pasha has asked for reinforce
ments. Ten additional battalions will
be sent to him. Pending their arrival
Shakir Pasha is negotiating with the
Albanians.

"About 11:15 the first Japanese shellâ
a twelve-inch one â dropped among the
Russian battleshiDs right off the en

about one-third, of a mile away' from
us. The torpedo-boats, tho training

and went Into the harbor, while those
on the b5c ships continued washing
their chains and trying to get their an

the meantime beginning to thicken. We
started to weigh, having for pleasant
companions a three-funneled- battle-
BOMBARDMENT BEGINS.
"At 10:50 a. m. we were cleared from
quarantine, and at the same time one
of the cruisers returned at great epeed,
firing heavily astern, the others having
returned previously. We were then or
dered to shift our berth for the training
ship, but were not assigned to any spe
cial position. We started to weigh an
chor and moved to the westward, close
to the steamer Ningoota, which had
only Just got in, having slipped in close
In Â¦ 6hore round the promontory from
the westward. At 10:55. or just as we
took up our berth, we saw the Japanese
fleet, sixteen ships in number, coming
up full speed from the eastward. The
battleEhips were leading, then came the
armored cruisers, with the remaining
cruisers in the rear, all in single file.
The Russian fleet was weighing anchor
slowly, washing their chains and try
ing .to cet their great wooden-stocked
mooring anchors fished, instead of slip
ping them and getting their ships un
der command. It was greatly amazing,
the Japanese fleet being almost on top
of them.
"At 7:55 I saw distinctly with the
telescope that the Rising Sun of
Japan was flying from their mastheads
and gaffs. It was like an electric
shock to us Â¦ and we- understood at
once the meaning of the night ma
neuvers, though we had been looking
on for nearly two hours, thinking that,
as the Chinese on board said, there
had been a bad collision among the
fleet the night before. The whole Rus
sian fleet was now weighing slowly and
clumsily and by 8:20 were under way
and steaming after the Japanese
cruisers, but farther inshore, toward
Dalny. . In a few minutes the'Jap
anese were out of sight to the south
eastward and at 9:15 a. m. the Rus
sian fleet returned to anchor, actually
dropping the same great mooring
anchors, although it had taken them
so long to get them up before. They
were perfectly certain, and said so
openly, that . the Japs would never
dare to attack Port Arthur. After
ward they sent a couple of cruisers out
scouting in the direction in which the
enemy'* cruisers had disappeared.
"Turning round and looking sea
ward we saw outside the fleet Â«a ring
of torpedo-boats and farther. out we
saw some of the Russian cruisers that
we knew to the westward, while^sev

were three two-funneled cruisers) and
lay In line, stern on, about six or seven
miles off. Then we noticed numbers
of men on the forts overhead, looking
out- to eea, while the decks of the
stranded cruiser were crowded with
men all looking in the same direction.
About 7:45 a. m. the three cruisers
turred and slowly steamed across the
front of the Russian fleet, to the east

off.: Â¦'-Â¦;. -
WARSHIPS AT SEA.
"Betwetn half-past 12 and 1 o'clock
the two Russian battleships passed in
and took up a position right across the
narrow entrance, while . one of the
larger cruisers took up a position close
to the entrance under the lighthouse.
It geemed to us a strange maneuver
for such" large ships at night time, so
we stayed on deck to watch further de
velopments. As it was cold, . however,
and things became a trifle slow, we
turned in about 2 a. m. At 2:35 a. m.
we were called out again as two very
excited naval officers boarded us and
in a mixture of French and English
asked our names, etc. We got no news
from them, as they left in about a min
ute. At 5:30 a. m. another naval officer
boarded us and we learned that the
Viceroy had ordered that no ship was
to leave or enter the harbor until fur
ther notice. After that I remained on
deck with one passenger, and at day
light we made out that one of the bat
tleships was all down by the head and
another by the stern, while the big
c-ruiser had a heavy list to port, all of
them having, we learned later, been
torpedoed and now lying aground.
The following account of the Japan

as given by an eye-witness, an officer
â¢of a merchant ship lytnK iq-the- outer
harbor <>f Port' Arthur at the time, is
taken from the North China. Daily
News, published at Shanghai. ' It is
euecinct and circumstantial to a de
gree not attained . by any account by
cable or letter yet published and for
that reason Is here given in full:
"On the Sth instant, at 11:30 p. m., we
were lying in quarantine outside of the
entrance. The Russian . fleet was lying
Jn three lines outride us. and on the
eastern side of the entrance there w<;-re
also a fow shipf, gunboats, training
chips and torpedo-boats cruising in the
same line with' ourselves, making a
fourth line. Suddenly we felt a heavy
Bubmarine explosion, with two more in
<4Uick succession. The Russian fleet
then began firing from the outer line
with light "puns, their. drums beating to
Quarters?, while . the searchlights of
every s=hiy .vÂ«re turned on. Steam
launches - and torpedo-boats began
rushing about, buTt in a few minutes
The firing died down and we thought It
v.as only some night maneuver. We
were about to turn in again when the
firing broke out afresh.
"It was principally owing to the
cruiser Novik that we came in for such
a hot time, as the battleship returned
to the rest of the fleet shortly after
the fight began, and they never went
out any distance, but floundered about,
it seemed very much in each other's
way, under the guns of their heavy
forts. The commander of the Novik,
on the contrary, handled his ship very
pluckily, having advanced far outside
the others to the westward along our
line of retreat. He kept dodging at
great' speed backward and forward,
while his guns were served well and
quickly. I am afraid, however, they
were too light to have much effect on
the battleships they were opposed to,
and at that end of the line, toward the
finish, he drew such a concentrated
fire from the heavy ships that he had
to retire amid a regular storm of shell,
one of which burst right at the stern,
but without apparently hitting the
Novik directly.
"It was lucky for us that the range
was long and the lighter guns little
used, or we could never have gone
through it. At 11:43 we cleared the
fire zone and by 11:45 the action had
practically ceased, as the Japanese
fleet had turned shortly before, every
ship in her own place, and steamed
across the Russian front, the cruisers
then leading, with the armored cruisers
next and the battleships bringing up
the rear.
"It was impossible to see w?iat Â«'am
age the Japanese suffered. ,'.t should,
of course, have been much heavier thi'.n
that of the Russians, seeing that they
were under the flre of so many heavy
forts, as well as of the Russian fleet.
Yet we saw nothing to lead us to sup
pose that they were badly damaged,
and they left in the same perfect order
as they came. Nor was any ship of
the Russian fleet sunk during the time
that jve were present, though several
sustained considerable damage. For
the Japanese had failed to draw them
from under, the guns of the. forts and
the assistance that the stranded ships
were able to give with their heavy
guns.
"The Russians had engaged: Five
battleships, five cruisers and one vol
unteer cruiser, and they also had the
two battleships and one large cruiser
aground. The Japanese fleet consisted
of sixteen ships, rating unknown, but
I think there were four battleships,
: three armored cruisers and nine
cruisers."
"All this time we were racing along
the beach to the westward, while the
shells were falling thickly around us,
but fortunately bursting in the water.
One heavy shell that burst after cover
ed our stern with smoke and spray, so
that looking from forward I thought
our stern was blown away. A second
later one burst under our bows and
sent a shower up forward, and so
things went on, the concussion taking
away our breath and shaking the ship
like a leaf. Looking ahead and astern,
you could see the shells plainly going
for the' forts. â¢ One. large shell that
passed close over us must have been
nearly spent, as it zig-zagged from
side to side, changing its course as it
went; but when it struck the base of
the hill and exploded it shifted a pile
of sand and stones.
NOVIK DOES GOOD WORK.
ship and the small cruiser Novik. The
former, abreast of us, distant about 300
yards, was throwing beds and bedding
and lumber of all sorts through her
amldship gun ports as she got her
headway on, j while we. raced close in
shore away to the westward. At iirst
this battleship also hauled to the west
ward abreast of up, but about a mile
farther out, with the ..Novik a little
ahead of her. while the forts were over
our head. Thus, being directly in the
line of fire, the shells fell thick In the
water around us, on the beach, the
hillside and over the forts.
'â¢Looking i back the . fleet were
bunched together and fairly helpless,
as until then,: with the exception of our
three-funneled friend, only the cruisers
had got properly under way, though
they were" all firing their heavy guns
as -they were- able. A Russian volun
teer ship, armed as a cruiser, got under
way as soon as any of them, and pass
ing/out through the battleships and
half a mile beyond, found things so hot
that she turned and passed back ir.
side them again, though how she-es
caped, while broadside on, is a marvel.
"Just then I saw a shell burst right
at the stern of a battleship, when they
wore still washing the anchor and some
twenty men were trying to drag a
heavy fish-hook forward to the anchor.
It. blotted out everything in dense,
black smoke, and before the smoke
cleared away she was shut in by the
next in line advancing, so we could
not see the damage done. Then an
other battleship was struck broadside,
abreast of her forward funnel, and then
another on her port quarter, and the
cruiser Askold had her after funnel
and main topmast carried away. These
were all heavy shells bursting on the
outside and were plainly noticeable
from the volumes of black smoke which
they sent up. Of course we could not
see those which penetrated and burst
inside, though doubtless many that
struck the water alongside must have
hit the vessels as well. The cruisers,
strange to say, fought most of the time
outside the battleships and on the wing,
but retired on them toward the end of
the action.

J. R. Burton of Kansas in the District
Court. Chief Postofflce Inspector W.

explained the procedure of handling
complaints made to the department &nd
the issuance of fraud orders.
The most important witness of the
forenoon session was Ernest W. Kas
tor, a member of a St. Louis adver
tising firm. He testified that he had
introduced Senator Burton to Presi
dent H. C. Dennis of the Rialto com
pany and to Judge Thomas B. Har

that he could not act in any capacity
before the Postofflce Department for
the company. Burton suggested that
the $2500 be paid to him in monthly in

TOKIO,- March 23.â The House of
Representatives to-day appointed a
committee of eighteen members to in
vestigate the charge that Teisuke Aki
yama," a member of Parliament, is in
the employ of the Russian Government.
Akiyama is the publisher of the Niro
kushltbun, a Tokio paper which has
been bitterly assailing the Gov
ernment, particularly upon its financial
policy. It has charged the Government
with having forced capitalists to sub
scribe to the war bonds recently issued,
and. has predicted that a second loan
will prove a failure.. A local prosecu
tion, which was Instituted resulted in a
decision yesterday ordering the perma
nent suppression of the publication and
the imprisonment of the editor for four
months. The case was subsequently
appealed, and both Akiyama and his
friends vigorously deny thp/iharge that
he is a spy. The hearing oefore the
committee and the later discussion of
the question in the House promise to
be exceedingly bitter.
The special session of the Diet to-day
entered upon the business for which It
was called. . President Katsura and
Minister of Foreign Affairs Komura
addressed the House. The Premier said
that the Diet had been summoned at
an. unparalleled moment in the annals
of the country. He counted it a great
honor to share with the members the
duty of upholding the noble policy of
the Emperor. The maintenance of the
permanent peace of the Orient by re
specting the legitimate rights of the
powers, he said, was the established
national policy of Japan. Continuing,
he said:
"Russia not only failed to meet the
Japanese proposals, but defiantly re
sorted to action calculated to injure the
national rights of Japan. Japan* was
'compelled, in self-defense, to terminate
negotiations and to take independent
action."
He was confident the world would
recognize the justice and patience uni
formly exercised by Japan in carrying
forward the negotiations. He was anx
iously desirous of peace, mindful of
the .woeful consequences which war
brought to mankind.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Komura
placed before the House the full text
of the diplomatic correspondence with
Russia, commencing with the opening
of negotiations last July and ending
with Instructions to Minister Kurino to
withdraw from St. Petersburg. The
substance of the correspondence has al
ready been made public.
â¢ No mention was made in the House
of the threatened tobacco bribery scan
dal, and possibly no mention will be
made, as all parties have resolved to
support : a three-year . compensation
plan, thus defeating any project to have
the amount of compensation to be paid :
to manufacturers calculated on a four
year basis.
The statement that Captain Irkorff
of .. the, M.anchurian , commissariat ser
vice was recenjtly ' summarily court
martialed and shot as a spy Is Incor
rect. The War Office discovered that
he had sold information In connection
with the quaratermaster's department
to Lieutenant Colonel Akashl, military
attache of the Japanese legation here,
and he was dismissed from the army.
He has now been arrested and Is await-,
ing trial by court-martial. The infor
mation sold by Irkorff is officially pro
nounced unimportant.
The dispatch of troops to the Far
East is proceeding with increased
vigor. A rifle battalion left St. Peters
burg to-day and three others will fol
low this week, the largest draft going
from the Moscow district. The Em
peror has decided not to go to Moscow.
He will remain at thq Winter Palace
until the end of April and will go to
Tsarkoye-Selo, where he may stop all
summer.
Private telegrams received at the
Admiralty here say that immediately
following the Port Arthur bombard
ment yesterday the Japanese again
spread .reports among the Chinese that
the Russians had abandoned the tbwn.
The authorities express the greatest
satisfaction with the internal situation
of the empire. The hearty patriotism
manifested in all pants of Russia has
profoundly impressed the- authorities.
All of the reports received by the Min
istry of the Interior indicate that the
critics of the Government, instead of
profiting by the war, have been almost
completely disarmed. Two attempts at
anti-Government demonstrations in
Kieff and Odessa, according to the3e
rtports, found the temper of the people
violently opposed to them. Within the
past fortnight only a single incident
occurred which could be construed as
an. evidence of dissatisfaction. This
was the throwing of a bomb at a chapel
In Vilna, the capital of the Lithuanian
Government in Western Russia, a few
days ago. Up to date the author and
the purpose of the outrage have not
been discovered. Â«
According to private advices from
Vladivostok the Russian squadron is
still there. ' :^'
ST. PETERSBURG, March 23.â The
reports printed in Europe and the
United States to the effect that a state
of siege has been proclaimed in Siberia
and in Saratoff province, Southeastern
Russia (through which the Siberian
Railroad runs) and will be extended
to the whole of European Russia is
officially declared to be absolutely
false. No such measure has even been
contemplated, it being 'considered quite
unnecessary. ' :
BERLIN, March 23. .â The 'semi
official Post to-night published a com
munication from a well-known diplo
mat in Paris, who says that in the
French capital a very pessimistic view
is taken # of the tension which undoubt
edly has' set in between Russia and
China, and adds that all fears regard
ing the attitude of China toward the
war seem to be approaching realiza
tion. Dispatches have been received
at Qua! d'Orsai from Peking stating
that the Chinese Government still de
nies that it has any intention. of aban
doning its attitude of neutrality, but
everything goes to' show that it is
really only waiting for a favorable
opportunity to take part in the hos
tilities. The Russian government has
received similar reports from its Min
ister in Peking and is taking measures
in consequence. /
In the last day or two an exchange
of views of an exhaustive character
has taken place between the French
and" Russian Governments as to China's
intervention in the war, .but no deci
sion has yet been reached as to the
lines of action to be adopted by France
in this eventuality. The answer of the
Chinese Government to the threaten
ing dispatches sent in by Russia is
awaited with anxiety.
In view of the relations which the
Post maintains with the Foreign Office
here a statement of this kind in its
columns Is important.

Interesting details of the Japanese advance townrd the Yalu are contained in a series of dispatches

Servillano Aquino, an Insurgent Fili

ing of five American prisoners, three
of whom died. The Secretary reviews
the case at considerable length and
says that Aquino, who has now been
confined for three years, should re
ceive a full pardon. In closing: hia re
view of the case Secretary Taft says:
"I cannot read the record without
feeling that there Is very gTave doubt
of Aquino's guilt. He is not shown
at any time . to have been cruel or
harsh In his treatment of the prison
ers. On the contrary, so far aa the
prisoners* own evidence goes, he was
considerate with them and Interfered
to aid them."
LOOM1S, Neb., March 23.â A prairie
fire is raging throughout this section
of the State and already three deaths
are reported, while a number of farm
ers are ' missing. \ Houses and stock
running far toward $100,000 in valua
tion have already been lost, and the
fire continues with unabated fury.
August Olsen, an aged farmer, is
known to have be/n burned to death
and two of his employes are missing.
James Lewis and William Anderson,
ranchmen, are also dead. A number of
cowboys are reported missing from dif
ferent directions.
The flames are past all hope of con
trol and are leaping across the prairie
Â»t race horse speed, burning everything
in their path. The Burlington Railroad
has sent a special train with fire fight
ers from Holdredge to assist the ranch
men in saving the small towns in the
path of the flames.
From Loomis to the Platte River, fif
teen miles, the whole country will un
doubtedly be swept clear by the fire.
Farther to the west, toward which the
blaze, is sweeping, the prairie country
extends for. nearly 200 miles. There
are no streams of note along this coun
try and the fire may sweep to the bÂ«nd
of the Platte River in that direction.

NAPA, March 23. â State Veterinar
ian Charles H. Blemer has finished his
investigation into the condition of the
band of cattle recently imported Into
Napa County and Lake County by the
Pacific Improvement Company. He
will file written report with the Super
visors of Napa County in a few days.
Dr. Blemer went by way of Middle
town into Jerusalem Valley, where
about 570 of the herd were located on
the Lake County side of Putah Creek.
He found nearly all. the cattle had
ticks on them, but not Texas fever
ticks. He is convinced that the cattle
are not infected with^ny disease. This
means that no quarantine will be es
tablished and no further action taken
by State or county as to the disposi
tion of cattle. Ticks on cattle, import
ed are much like Texas ticks in ap
pearance except as to shape and size
of head and general method of work
ing on the cattle.

One of Ihe effects of the series of
storms in the Great Salt Lake Valley
this winter, which have resulted in the
heaviest precipitation for years, has
been a rapid rise in Great Salt Lake.
The great lako since the first of the
year has been rising at the rate of six
inches a month.
SALT LAKE CITY. March 23. â The
storm which yesterday and last nifiht
raged along the Pacific Coast extends
to-day all over the intermountain
region, from Central Arizona and New
Mexiro to Central Montana. Rain or
snow is reported all over the wide des
ort stretches of Arizona, New Mexico,
Nevada and Southern Utah, and the
ranges in those States are receiving a
sorely needed soaking. In Salt Lake
City the rain, which turned to a blind
ing snowstorm this afternoon, was
accompanied by a wind that reached
the velocity of fifty miles an hour, and
some damage to trees and outbuildings
resulted. Tho storm resulted in al
most complete prostration of telegraph
service all over the West and North
west for the greater part of the day,
and accompanying snowslides and
landslides resulted in more or less de

J. G. Martine, a resident of Sacra
mento and commissioner to the St.
Louis Exposition representing the city
and county of Sacramento and the
Chamber of Commerce there, arrived
in this city last evening. Regarding the
flood situation he said:
"The people of San Francisco are
mistaken if they believe that Sacra
mento and the cities along the rover
were greatly damaged by the late flood
Ipnd heavy rains. They have been told
that the northern part of the country
is one great waste of water and that it
will be many years before the damage
can be repaired. To the contrary, Te
hama. Redding, Red Bluff and Sacra
mento are perfectly safe from any
great damage and have been through
out the entire season. In Sacramento
more than 160 houses are now under
construction, and there is no reason
why within a few years the capital's
population should not be doubled. With
the advent of the Santa Fe and Central
Pacific railways into Sacramento the
city itself and surrounding towns will
flourish, and already laborers from all
parts of the State are hurrying to the
Sacramento Valley, for they know that
their services will be accepted there.
"But as for California suffering from
the great rains and floodsâ this is the
mast prosperous year in the history of
the State, and Califomians are to be
congratulated."

Lieutenant General Nelson A. Miles a i
reply to his recent letter to Miles in j
reference to holding a national conven

tion from the Prohibition party, is the

Efforts have been made within the

Democratic party to get General Miles
to announce himself as a candidate.
The only reply rrade came In the form
of a request to postpone any announce
ment for the time being. Meanwhile
General Miles has accepted an invita
tion to be the principal speaker at
the Jefferson day banquet of the Iro
quois Club, Chicago, one of the prom
inent Democratic organizations of the
West, and he "will respond to the toast
"Our Country." It is believed here to
night that at that time he will be
hailed as a candidate for the Demo

Special Disratch to The Cill
SACRAMENTO, March 23.â Mayor
Hassett presided at a meeting in Sier

the purpose of hearing 1 an address by
P. H. Scullin, who advocates arbitra
tion in settlement of the present la
bor troubles between mechanics af
filiated with the Building Trades
Council and their employers. Only
about forty-five men were present.
Scullin, in accounting for this, de
clared that N the meeting was boycotted
by the union men.
"This will do them no good, as it
shows that they do not want fair
play,"' said Scullin.
Scullin made an earnest address, ad
vocating resort to arbitration in ad
justing such difficulties. He was lis
tened to with great attention by the
persons present and his views appear
ed to be received with approval, as
he was applauded at the conclusion of
his address.
Mayor Hassett said he would wel
come and favor any movement that
would tend to a settlement of the dis

The town of Telluride is reported to
be quiet to-night. 'Information from
Ouray, a neighboring mining camp,
where the deported Telluride men
sought refuge, tells of a joint meeting
held there to-night between the unions
of Silverton and Ouray, which was at
tended by President Moyer of the West
ern Federation of Miners and the de
ported Telluride unionists. It was de
cided to start some of the evicted men
back to Telluride to-morrow to test
the situation. This will be done under
the injunction issued by Judge Stevens
of Ouray yesterday. If the men are
interfered with a stand will be made
first on the powers of the injunction.
Should this prove unavailing, President
Moyer says that proceedings for dam
ages will be commenced In the Federal
courts against all concerned in the de
portation of the Telluride unionists.
HIT also said that charges of kidnap
ing may be brought against them under
the Federal laws. .
TRINIDAD, Colo., March 23.â A spe
cial train bearing 3S0 members of the
National Guard ' arrived here at noon
to-day. The coming of the troops
caused absolutely no excitement.
Camp was established in this city and
detachments were sent out to the var
ious coal camps to relieve the mine
guards employed by the coal companies
at $5 per diem. Immediately upon ar
rival of the militiamen Major Hill read
his first general order placing the en
tire county under martial law and or
dering all saloon3, dance halls and
other resorts of a questionable charac
ter to close at 9 p. m. daily. All citi
zens having firearms in their posses
sion are ordered to register them im
mediately with the military authori
ties, and the sale of firearms and am
munition in the county is absolutely
forbidden.
The mine owners have insisted for
months past that they could not get
men to operate their properties because
non-unionists were afraid to go to
work unless afforded military protec
tion. Sheriff Clark was finally induced
to join the request for troops on the
ground that he could no longer con
trol the situation.
Good order prevails throughout the
county so far as reported.
DENVER. March 23.â After ten days
of civil control, San Miguel County is
again under martial law. According
to news from Telluride, the principal
town of the San Juan mining district,
which includes San Miguel County, a
proclamation Issued by Governor Pea
body was read there to-night declaring
the county to be in a state of", insur
rection and rebellion and ordering Cap
tain Wells of the local troop to assume
control of the affairs of the county.
In the proclamation it is stated that
certain armed bands within and with
out the county are preparing to join
forces for the purpose of resisting the
law and destroying property. Another
reason given for placing the military
in control is that- crimes have been
committed and threats are being made
by alleged disordeiiy persons.
The primary cause for the placing of
San Miguel under the .control of the
military again is the trouble between
the union miners and the Citizens'
Alliance, which resulted in the deport
ing of a number of union men several
days ago. The action of the Governor
was consequent upon an appeal from
the Sheriff of the county, who stated
that affairs had reached such a state
that he could no longer enforce the
law.
SAN JOSE, March 23.â Unless some
thing out of the ordinary occur, Santa
Clara Valley should reap a golden har
vest this year. Not for years has the
county received such a soaking as it
has during the months of February
and March. During the month of Feb
ruary 3.43 inches of rain fell, and so
far this month there have been 3.43
inches of rain. This makes a total ot
10.93 inches for the season, against
12.29 inches to the same date last year.
Last year the rains 'came earlier. For
the twenty-four hours ending this
morning .40 of an inch fell. This after
noon it is clear and it is believed the
storm is over.
Few seasons have been more pro
pitious than this one for big crops.
The late' rains and warm weather will
cause everything to grow. Prune trees
are beginning to bud, and in another
month the orchards will be in full
bloom. Hay and grain are looking
fine, and there is now plenty of moist
ure in the ground to assure fine crops.
BALLARD, March 23. â The storm
which has been gathering for several
days resulted in a little over half an
inch of rain last night. Although the
wind changed and a north gale is
blowing, yet appearances indicate
more rain. The rainfall for the season
is 5.60 Inches. .
RIVERSIDE, March 23. â A furious
rain kept up all night here until this
morning. The precipitation was 1.82
inches. The rain was general over the
county, although It was heaviest In the
mountain 'and foothill regions.
BISHOP, March 23. â The rain here
during last night was 1.19 inches, bring
ing the total of March up to 2.22. The
total precipitation since September 1 is
a half an Inch above the normal. The
mountains are better covered with
snow than usual, insuring an ample
supply of water for summer irrigation.
SANTA ANA, March 23. â The
heaviest rain of the season fell here
last night, with a recorded precipita
tion of 1.91 inches, making the season's
total 5.10 inches. In' the mountains and
the â¢grain-producing country east of
here 2% inches fell, bringing the total
up to more than 8 inches and insuring
hay crops, ample mountain pasture and
a fair honey crop,' which". were hereto-
Xore la doubt. ,
HANFORD. March 23.â The storm
that has been coming down the -valley
for several days reached here Tues
day afternoon and a good, steady rain
continued through most of the after
noon and night, with a total precipi
tation of one inch, which makes a to
tal for the season of 5.15 inches. Tills
last rain is the heaviest one of the
season and although the cold wind
of to-day dried it up considerably, yet
the prospects are very encouraging for
a good year in every line of Industry.
The storms in the mountains hav-i
caused the water in Kings Rivur to
rise seven and a half feet and this
looks encouraging to those who have
to Irrigate. There is some indication
of frost to-night, and if it is a heavy
one the fruit crop will be damaged
materially, but the light frosts of late
have done no harm. The high wind
here last night did some damage. The
storm at Coalinga amounted to l.'o.
which is an exceedingly heavy rain
for that section.
JOY W SANTA CLARA COUNTY.
There has been much damage in all
parts of the county and while San Ra
fael has received the sxeatest precip
itation, yet the damage is not as great
as in other portions of the countv.
Generally Sausalito and Mill Valley
both record a greater amount of rain.
This year is an exception. Sausalito
has had 28.35 for this season, while
up to the same time last year it had
45.53 inches. Great damage has been
done to vegetable and fruit farms,
while the overflowing: of streams has
caused havoc with property. Many
elegant residences i-ri Ross Valley and
San Anselmo have^been injured, \vhlle
reports from up country points stat^
that hundreds of acres of land are
inundated.

SAN RAFAEL, March 23.â Marin
County has had more rain up to the
present time this season than for any
previous entire year since 1889, and
with two exceptions since 1875. The
precipitation for this immediate vicin
ity thus far this season has been 43.39.
In the last four days the downpour
has been registered at 2.53 inches, be
ing over one inch in the last twenty
four hours. In one storm last month
eleven inches fell in three days. Last
season's entire rainfall at San Rafael
was 36.4 6.
DAMAGE IX MARIX.
SAN DIEGO, March 2 3.<â The best
rain that has fallen in San Diego
County this year was the one which
began in showers last night and came
down in little less than torrents at
about 5 o'clock this morning. Back
country reports show the mountain
streams running and the fall has done
an immense amount of good. The
farmers throughout the county are
now practically certain of a hay crop
and if a little more rain falls and the
weather is favorable during April] and
May, that is, without any exceedingly
dry and burning weather, some of
them will harvest grain crops. The
fall of last night to 5 o'clock this
morning was .38 of an inch and di
rectly after that hour the fall was
sufficiently heavy to mark .81 upon
the gauge. The heaviest rain came to
the back country, or rather to the
foothills this side of the mountains.
Julian reported full three inches of
rain and all the streams running.
Cuyamaca reported 2.96 and, water
flowed into the reservoir. Upper Otay
reported .89 of an inch and the two
streams running into the reservoir.
The rain was t accompanied by heavy
winds.
TRUCKEE, March 22.â Freight train
No. 217, the second section of which
left here with two battleship locomo
tives at 11:40 last night, ran into a
snowslide which destroyed snowsheds
at Cisco at 1 o'clock this morning. Both
engines and five cars were buried un
der the enow, ranging from ten to
twenty feet in depth. The engineers
and firemen of the locomotives were
Imprisoned. Engineer Deming and his
fireman were released with little trou
ble, but Engineer Gray and his fireman
were held captive In the cab for sev
eral hours until released by big crews
of men sent from Truckee and other
near-by points. None of the crew was
injured. The men could be heard talk
ing under the snow, but the train crew
could make no headway against the
continual sliding avalanche from the
mountain side.
About 500 feet of snowsheds were de
stroyed and traffic was tied up all day.
Trains were held at both sides of the
wreck. Wrecking trains from Truckee
and Sacramento and all the available
snow shovelers were at work. A second
slide of 300 feet occurred just beyond
Cisco and added to the difficulty of
clearing the track. It Is thought
probable that one or more tramps who
were beating their way on the burled

and water came down the roadbed in
large quantities and fifty feet of track
on the main line were washed out.
Seven hours were occupied in making
repairs, and all trains were delayed.

SACRAMENTO, March 23. â The
high water situation is still giving the
river residents much concern. The
situation south of the city of Sacra
mento is not reassuring. After the
Edwards break occurred the trustees
of Reclamation District 535 con
tracted with Darby Laydon of San
Francisco to stop further erosion at
the ends with piling of a certain
length. This piling has' washed away
and with it nearly 200 feet of levee
heretofore sound. The trustees claim
Laydon violated his contract by driv
ing shorter piles than those bargained
for and they -will refuse to pay his
claim. The contract for closing the
Edwards break Itself was let to Clark
& Henery of Stockton for about
$24,000 and the work should have
been completed yesterday. The action
of the high water and the destruction
of the Laydon work and new portions
of the levee have combined to keep
the break open and water % is still
coursing through it. The river itself
is not at a danger point at Sacramento,
but the backwater from the Edwards
break has attained an average depth
of five feet upon 10,000 acres below the
city and only the Y-street levee, a bar
rier which lias thus far proved very
effective, keeps it from coming into
the lower part of the city.

Democratic members of the Senate to.
air their demands for an investigation'
by Congress of the Postofflce Depart
ment. Notice to that effect was served
upon the Senate Committee on Post
offices and Post Roads to-day by the
Democratic members when the commit
tee again put off the requests of Sen
ators Gorman and Clay that one of the
resolutions now pending in committee
looking to Congressional investigation
be reported to the Senate. The Demo
cratic Senators have persistently urged
that any one of the resolutions be re
ported, but the demands have been
combated by the Republicans on : the
ground . that there is no necessity for
an investigation that has not been
made or that cannot be made by the
Postofflce Department. ' v
The plan of the De.mocra.tks Senators
is now to offer a new resolution calling
attention to former resolutions and to
the fact that they have been' permitted
to sleep in committee. , This ; would

"Mr. Cleveland was not re-elected,
however; but when Congress con

closes with this sad arid terrifying an
nouncement: ' Corporations, which
should be carefully restrained creatures
of the law and servants of the people,
are fast becoming the people's mas

suggests no possible way of escape."
"He recommends no relief and sug

statement of fact was submitted and a
majority of the members of which be

appointed a commission to investigate
the subject. The purpose of the com

that if Mr. Cleveland were re-elected
some remedial legislation would fol

PROVIDENCE, R. I., March 23.âLes
lie M. Shaw. Secretary of the' Treas
ury, delivered an attack to-night upon
the policy of Grover Cleveland in rela
tion to the trusts while Cleveland was
President. The occasion was the ban
quet given by the Young Men's Repub
lican ClUb of this city in opening the
Rhode Island campaign in the interest
of President Roosevelt's candidacy for
the Republican nomination and also in
behalf of the candidacy of Senator Nel
son W. Aldrich for re-election. Secre
tary Shaw said, in part:
"Former President Cleveland does
not claim' to have recommended any
antf-trust legislation during either of
bis : administrations. He does not
claim that any anti-trust legislation
was passed during either of his ad
minlstrationsr He does not claim the
credit for any litigation ever instituted
to suppress any trust or combination
during either of his administrations.
"He simply seeks to explain why
nothing was done, and places the re
sponsibility therefor upon the courts
and constitution and upon the fact that
the Northern Securities Company was
not organized during his administra
tion.
"Mr. Cleveland was first inaugurated
President on March 4, 1885. Neither in
his inaugural address nor in any mes
sage does he mention the subject- of
trusts until immediately preceding the
election of 188S. In his last message
preceding that campaign he refers to
the existence of 'combinations frequent
ly called trusts,' and closes with this
conclusion: 'The people can hardly
hope for any consideration in the op
eration of these selfish schemes.'

The provision exempting farmers at
Indian agencies from, the requirement
to undergo a civil service examination
was reverted to and the general civil
service discussed. Gorman reiterated
his opinion that the civil service regu
lations should not be legislated upon
piecemeal and said that inasmuch as
the President has entire control of the
matter it should be left to him. He
Quoted from the instructions of the
President to the Isthmian Canal Com
mission as tending to show that the
thief executive has receded from his
advanced position on the general ap
plication of the civil service principles.
No one had ever supposed originally.
he said, that the principle would be
applied to minor places as it had been.
Hoar said the supplying of ' em
ployes for canal work was a different
thing from filling places in the execu
tive departments and expressed the
opinion that places connected with
the canal should be filled on the rec
ommendation of public men, regard
less of politics. Otherwise the selec
tions might be as unsatisfactory as are
those made under present systems in
vogue in filling Federal places in the
Southern States.
The amendment exempting Indian
agency farmers from the civil service
requirement was agreed to, and, with
out concluding consideration of the
bill, the Senate at 5:34 p. m. went into
executive session and at 5:36 p. m. ad
journed.
The old controversy over Choctaw
Indian leases was revived by a motion
by Kean to amend the committee
amendment for the payment of $50,000
out of the Choctaw funds to J. H.
Sj-pher for services rendered the In
dians in connection with the leases.
Plan supported the claim as valid, but
in reviewing its origin said that
$802,000 had been paid to lobbyists in
connection with this claim. Several
Senators spoke on the merits of Spyh
ers claim, all agreeing that his ser
vices to the Indians had been that of
en attorney and entirely legal and
legitimate. On motion of Patterson
the amount to be paid to Sypher was
reduced to $25,000. and the amend
ment as thus modified, after three
hours of debate, was defeated by a
vote of 23 to 25.
WASHINGTON. March 23. â The
Senate again spent the greater part of
the day considering the Indian ap
propriation bill. Three hours of time
was given to discussion of a claim of
$50,000 for "services rendered the
Choctaw Indians. It finally was elimi
nated from the Indian bill. The civil
service debate was renewed and there
was a discussion of the policy to be
pursued in securing employes for work
on the Panama Canal.
The department,, pointed out to the
Peking authorities through Minister
Conger that it was probable that so far
from bettering conditions relating to
the admission : of Chinese into the
United States any new treaty would
fail of approval 'by. the Senate. The
Chinese would thus be exposed in the
absence of a sheltering treaty to the
full rigor of the Geary and Heinz law,
and exclusion would be much more
complete than at present.
.WASHINGTON, March 23.â The. State
Department has received formal notice
from the Chinese Government denounc
ing the Chinese exclusion treaty, so the
present convention will expire .Decem
ber 27 next unless It is replaced by an
other treaty by. that date. Under its
terms six months before the expiration
of a period of ten years from December
27, 1894, if either power be dissatisfied
with the treaty, if Is "required to de
nounce it, and this Is the action which
China has taken in spite of the strong
est efforts to the contrary on. the part
of the State Department. Had the no
tice not been served the treaty would
have continued in force for. another ten
years from December 27, 1904.
"Mrs. Cody tried to poison me three
years ago." the colonel testified. "She
had frequently threatened to do it.
We were visiting, in Rochester, N. Y.,
during the. holidays of 1900, and the
day after Christmas I was ill. I sup
posed the turkey and plum pudding
did not .'agree with me. She said she
would, fix me up and pretended to give
me medicine. . It was poison. It al
most finished me, for I was uncon
scious for some time. I think it must
have been an overdose, for it made
me vomit, and I suppose this is what
saved my life."
In hisjestimony to-day Colonel Cody
relaterfrnany instances of his wife
having humiliated him at his "former
home" in North Platte by her conduct
toward his guests. "She drove my
friends away," he said. "When they
were no longer welcome in the hand
some residence I built and elaborately
furnished, it was no longer my home."
The witness then went into deta'Is
and recited many specific instances of
his wife's discourtesy to his guests.
Mrs. Cody's counsel inquired Into
the character of the guests to whom
she objected and ,lnto their conduct
while at her home. The purpose of
the inquiry was to show that the men
whom he brought to the house be
longed to a fast and riotous set and be
haved in such a manner that she had
a right to object to them.
DENVER, March 23.â Colonel Wil
liam F. Cody ("Buffalo Bill") made a
deposition before a notary in this city
to-day. In the action for divorce which
he has brought in Big Horn County,
Wyo. Colonel Cody will sail for Eu
rope shortly, and -will be absent from
the country when his suit is tried.' In
the proceedings to-day Colonel Cody
was interrogated by his own attorney
and was , subjected to cross-examina
tion by counsel for Mrs. Cody. .
PARIS, Marqh 23.â The belief steadily
grows that the Combes Ministry may
not be able to weather the recent minor
reverses and it is even said in high
quarters that the culmination of the
crisis is likely to come next Friday
with the retirement of Marine Minister
Pelletan and probably all other mem
bers of the present Ministry. ThÂ«
committee having In charge the inquiry
into the status of the navy is expected
to make its. report on Friday and this
probably will arouse a heated contro
versy and bring on a decisive issue as
to the strength of Pelletan and the
Ministry as a whole.
PARIS, March 23.â In the Chamber
of Deputies to-day opposition by the
Clerical party practically stopped pro
gress on the religious education bill,
the Clericals resorting to every possible
form of obstruction. Eventually the
sitting was adjourned until 9 p. m.,
owing to. the lack of a quorum.
Previous to this Premier Combes dis
cussed the effect of the amendment re
cently adopted authorizing novitiates
intended to be trained as teachers for
service in the colonies. The Premie",
who frequently showed much Irritation,
contested the theory that .the majority
which passed the amendment intended
to give the teaching congregations a
new lease of life. IÂ£_he thought that
such was the intention, he said, he
Avould ask the Chamber to pronounce
positively for or against the suppres
sion of the congregations. He pointed
out that the congregations were dis
solved by the first clause of the bill
and that consequently the effect of the
amendment was to create a- new con
gregation with a specific action rt
stricted to the colonies.
Moon of Tennessee moved to strike
out the entire provision appropriating
1142,728 for speciasl mail facilities on
trunk lines from "Washington to At
lanta and New Orleans, but it was lost,
80 to 88. An amendment by Robinson
of Indiana to strike out the provision
of $2S,000 for special facilities on trunk
lines from Kansas City to Newton,
Kans.. also was lost, 65 to 69.
At 5: JO p. m. the House adjourned.
Smith's amendment was lost, 43 to 71.
Hughes then withdrew his former
amendment regarding the making or
repairing of mail bags in prisons and
offered- a substitute, which wag agreed
to, providing, "that hereafter no con
tract shall be entered into by the Post
office, Department for the purchase of
material or supplies to be manufac
tured by convict labor."
An amendment by Snapp of Illinois
providing that out of the appropriation
of $1,200,000 for mall messenger service
$100,000 shall be allotted to the under
ground tunnel system in Chicago was
agreed to after considerable debate.
Representative Hughes of New Jer
sey offered an amendment limiting the
appropriation for mail bags so that it
shall not be available for the purchase
or repair of mail bags made in prisons
or by convicts. Gardner of New Jersey
declared the - situation ridiculous.
United States mail bags, he said, were
being made in New Jersey State pris
ons. At the same time those prisons
contained United States prisoners, who,
under the law, are forbidden to work
on Government supplies. Side by side
with these Federal prisoners were State
prisoners, and these were making mail
bags for the Government. He believed
the amendment to prohibit this should
go in the bill. By unanimous consent
the sectron of the bill and the amend
ment temporarily were passed over.
Cowherd of. Missouri called attention
to the report of the postal commission
which, he said, had expressed the opin
ion that the rates paid the railroads
for carrying the "mails should not be
reduced, and he made an extended
argument In support of this view. He
was Interrupted by i Baker of New York
who, with some passion, inquired "if
the gentleman maintains that men who
have railroad passes in their pockets
are not prejudiced in favor of The rail
roads?"
Cowherd replied, amid applaus*. that
he would leave it to the House whether
he had been so informed.
Baker excitedly declared that there
were some members who have been in
formed, which called for a rebuke from
the chair, who said that Baker had
transgressed the rules of orderly pro
cedure In the House.
WASHINGTON. March 23.â When
the Hbuse^adjourned to-day some-pro
gress had been made, in the reading
of the postofflce appropriation bill for
amendment, but only six pages were
disposed of. The appropriation for the
railway mail service was carefully
scrutinized, and in- the case of jnland
mail transportation' by star routes the
appropriation was scaled down from
$8,100,000 to' $7,850,000. The question as
to the length of time a postal car may
be used before it becomes unfit, for
service was settled by the House when
an amendment- by Tawney of Minne
sota was adopted providing that no
part of the appropriation shall be used
for the rental of cars which have been
in service for more than fifteen years.
An unsuccessful fight was made
against the appropriations for special
mail facilities over trunk lines south
from Washington and west from Kan
sas City. I
To the provision in the bill appro
priating $5,736,000 for railway postal car
service Tawney of Minnesota offered
an amendment providing that no part
of the sum shall be expended for use
of cars In the railway mail service that
have been used in said service more
than fifteen years. The amendment
was agreed to by a vote of 61 to 59.
Furuseth reviewed the religious and
social development of the world from
the Roman empire to the present time/
He said that the opponents of the bill
held that the product of labor, was a
property right. This right had been
admitted in every injunction that had
been issued against labor, but it wa?
a f .i entirely erroneous assumption.
Gompers challenged many of the
statements of the opponents of the
measure. He declared that the use, of
the injunction against labor was of
comparatively recent origin and en
tirely unjustified, and in speaking of
the extent to which labor is organized
he said:
"I agree that we do not represent a
majority of the workingmen of the
country, but I venture to say that we
represent the most intelligent, the most
skillful and the most manly of the
v.orkingmen of the country, and this,
too. without any reflection upon the
ccn-union men."
WASHINGTON'. March 23.â The
House Judiciary Committee to-day con
tinued the hearing on the anti-injunc
tion bill. Senator Matson of Indiana
spoke in opposition to it and said thÂ«*
labor unions', policy, was to intimidate
and coerce. He characterized John
Mitchell as v the most conservative labor
leader in this country, but said no man
ever uttered a greater untruth than
Mitchell when he declared "Once a
worklngman, always a workingman."
J. C. McCloskey of Pittsburg detailed
to the committee the beneficial effects
of the Injunction in labor troubles in
Pittsburg.
The afternoon session of the hearing
was devoted to arguments in favor of
the bill. H. R. FulJer. representing the
Railway Trainmen's organization; An
drew Furuseth, representing the Amer
ican Seamen's Union, and President
Gompers of the American Federation of
LaÂ£or were heard. The hearing ended
with Gompers' testimony. .
Fuller declared the opponents of the
bill had acknowledged that they were
practically in favor of government by
injunction, which would abolish trial
by jury and all the rights that labor
holds sacred. If the bill was uncon
stitutional; as its opponents have
claimed, then an amendment should be
made to the constitution. He criticized
Representative Hogg of Colorado for
coming before the committee and re
citing the reign of crime in his State,
saying Mr. Hogg should have been con
tent to oppose the bill on the floor, and
that murder and crime were questions
entirely outside of its scope, as the bill
legalized neither. t <

William McKown and William Glo
vannonl are boss teamsters and for some
time there has been a feeling of jeal
ous rivalry between them. Yesterday
morning shortly before 9 o'clock they
met In front of McDonough & Runyon's
commission house -at 416 Davis street
and Glovannoni fired at shot at Mc-
Kown, the bullet missing him. Glo
vannoni drove to Main street wharf,
where he was arrested on a charge of
assault to murder. He was released on
$500 cash bail accepted by Police Judge
Conlan.
Giovannonl used \ to work for Mc-
Kown, but left him about a year ago
and went to Alaska. After his return
he alleges that McKown insulted and
threatened him and when he entered
into partnership with Milton Gale in
the teaming business McKown abused
him every time he met him. Yesterday
morning Giovannonl alleges that Mc-
Kown wanted to fight, and being afraid
that McKown; who is much the taller
and bigger of the two, would do him.

of h!s pocket to scare him. McKown
seized a shovel and Giovannoni fired
the shot, not intending to hit him. Gio
vannoni is 22 years of age and his
father has a produce store at Sansome

Forty-five estates, ranging in value
from $27 to $928, which passed
through the hands of Former Public
Administrator John A. Drlnkhouse,
and which should have escheated to
the State because no heirs were found,
were the subject of an inquiry, in
Judge Coffey's Court yesterday. They
came up on an attempt of the attor
neys for Drlnkhouse to obtain a fee
for services they claimed they had
rendered In searching for heirs. Judge
Coffey took no pains to hide the fact
that he did not like the proceedings
and desired a further investigation. In
accordance with his expressed views
he set the matter for hearing on
April 6. â¢Â¦'? /â¢
The total value of the estates .is
$3245. According to an oft-expressed
opinion of the judiciary, estates of
this kind, for which no heirs have
been found, should escheat to the State
after a certain period. "The Public
Administrator," said Coffey, "is not in
the business of searphing for heirs,
and therefore his attorneys should
not be allowed any extra fees .for
making. a search." A representative of
the Attorney General of the State was
present during the proceedings, for

It was announced by the represent
atives of the freight department of the
Southern Pacific Company yesterday
that the long pending differences be
tween the transcontinental roads and
the Southeastern Traffic Association
are nearlng a settlement and that in
the near future shippers from both
West and East will be furnished a
printed tariff of rates between the
points within the territory of dispute
and this coast. The trouble with the
Southeastern railroads and the trans
continental lines grew out of the de
mand of the former for a greater ap
portionment of* the through rate,
which was denied them. Then the
Southeastern roads refused to co-op
erate with the transcontinental lines
and for months the relations have
been such as to cause no end of'an
noyance and uneasiness to shippers.
The fact that an agreement has final
ly been reached will be pleasing news
to the dried and canned fruit men of
California and the furniture manufac
turers of the East. It was stated yes
terday that while there will be no ma
terial change in the new East and
West bound tariff sheets that are soon
to be Issued, a supplemental tariff, of
a reciprocal character, will follow,
covering all the territory of the South
east and the Southwest. The South
eastern territory will, under the agree
ment, be divided into eight terminal
groups, and while the rates under this
tariff will not be as low as on the
regular transcontinental tariff, they
wiil be much lower than at present.
It is also purposed to make them per
manent, so that the shipper may care
fully reckon just â¢> how he stands in
matters of trade in the Southeastern
territory. . I
Long Pending Differences With the
Transcontinental Companies Will
Soon Be Settled.

According to the Herald the Juris

pany is to be considerably greater than
that of his predecessor, A. L. Mohler.
AH of the Southern Pacific system in
Oregon, north of Ashland, Is to be un
der his control. This means an addi
tion of 341 miles. The line between
Ashland and Portland is owned by the
Oregon and California Company, but is
leased by the Southern Pacific.
The various pystems comprised in the
Harriman lines will retain their pres
ent identity as regards the mainte

operating and traiSc scheme great
.changes will be made. Thus the ope
rating of trains on the Union and
Fouthem Pacific railroads from Reno,
Nev., to Greenriver, Utah, Including
the new Lucin cutoff, will come under
the operating department of the Ore
pon Short Line. This placing of this
preat stretch of road under Bancroft's
jurisdiction will, it is expected, result
in a great saving of time and expense.
In connection with this change, the
Dcsoret News states that Senator W.
A. Clark's road, the San Pedro, for
merly a part of the Oregon Short Line
and now being extended to Southern
California, will possibly within two
months be included in the new Short

John P. Killilea, a carpenter resid

grand larceny. A. A. Martin, a spe
cial officer for the telephone company,
and Policeman R. R. O'Brien took
Killilea into custody.
Killilea was arrested at his home
as he was eating supper. The
cause for his taking is the alleged
theft late yesterday afternoon of a
load of lumber belonging to the city.
Killilea was employed by the Elec
tion Commissioners in the razing of
voting booths. Yesterday afternoon
he was to have removed a load of
lumber from demolished booths from
the corner of Scott and Haight streets.
Instead of taking it to the corporation
yard Killilea, it is claimed, removed
the lumber, which was valued at $100.

Martin has su?pected Killilea for
some time of robbing telephone boxes.
For this reason he has been shadow
ing Killilea. Martin alleges he saw
Killilea haul the lumber to 305 Devis

proof of telephone burglaries commit
ted by Killilea.

also because this Is best for society. We need
all the intelligence, all the trained minds we
can have. There is never a surplus of wisdom
and true learning. There Is often a surplus
of peelantrj .
We need to put the higher education within
the reach of the poor because we cannot af
ford to endow the rich alone with the tremen
dous power of trained and cultivated minds.
To do this might form an aristocracy of for
midable strength. So long as the poor have
anything like equal chance with the rich of
developing their Intellectual power we % have
little to fear from an aristocracy of wealth;
but let wealth alone have the hlgheat Intellect
ual training, let the poor as a class be shut
out from the schools of generous culture, and
we must either consign the control of all in
tellectual and political life to the hands of the
rich or olst have a constant scene of turbu
lence between the. ignorant many and the en
lightened few. Bitter class hatred would be
inevitable. There can be no etable equilibrium.
It is in itse'f fiulnz and in a certain fÂ»nsc
it fa due to children as human beings that
the poorest child should have proper facilities
for obtaining by reasonable effort the b?3t
develorn-.ent of his talent and character. I
think 1 may apoeal to the common jenae :md
thf ter.eral feeling of civilized men '.n recog
nition of this truth. One of the highest -'id-J
of society is to help men 'make the most of
themselves. True, as I shall soon show, 'his
is partly because it is for the interest of all,
of society at large. But beyend that we in
utinctlvely recognize it as a duty to do wr.at
we can. both Individually and through the c r
ganlzcd action of society, to open to overy
childâ and for the .child's own sakeâ =a lair
chance for the- best start in life for. which
his talent fits him. I know that we often
Justify our Drovldine a free common school
education simply by showing the necessity of
BUch an education as a preparation for citizen

there is a profound satisfaction, and often an
impelling motive to our action. In the con
viction thet we are doing Mmply what Is Just,
what Is du* to every child a* a human beins,
in giving him an opportunity to kindle into
a flam* nny divine spark of Intelligence within
him. Is It loo much to say that the infant

possibility â has a right to claim a tolerable

amount of talent, self-denial and energy? For
the moment I am not considering whether his
claim should be met by lesislatlon or by vol

society In some way I think will be generally
conceded.

When we consider that the total cost of this
university to the treasury of the State from
Its foundation to this day hes been only a lit
tle more than $3.U00,0u0, which is less than
the cost of a first-class battleship; when we
remember that It has sent out over 5000 grad
uates, and that as many more have spent some
time under He roof, and. that these 10,000 men
and won<en are filling useful positions in all
honorable callings and enriching and strength
enlr; the life of the 8tate In innumerable
ways; when we remind ourselves that the
names and works of Its professors are honored
wherever In the world letters and arts and sci
ences and philosophy are honored; when we
recall the fact that by general consent of
scholars the university rank* with the first In
the land, and that It has made the name of
California known and respected not only
throuzh this ration, but beyond the seas, we
rr.ay well render our grateful tribute of praise
to the broad-minded and far-sighted men who
have bo wisely laid the foundations and begun
to rear the walls of this institution.
In all this vast audience, nay, within the
boundaries of this great* commonwealth, can
any cne be found to rise up and declare thi-.t
the builders of this unlverylty made a mlb
take in adopting so generous and comprehen
sive a policy for securing the best type of
liigher education tor the sons and daughters
of California? Still In this country, where
unlicensed freedom of speech sometimes leads
persons of eccentric temperament and of self
satisfied r>rlde of otrfnlon to rejoice In defend
ing paradoxes and in questioning the validity
of the fundamental principles of republican
government, it may not be altogether super
fluous or unprofitable for us on occasions like
this to consider the proposl:ion that I prot>i-,e
to d'Â»fÂ»sf>. That proposition is this, tha*. i;
Ik <if v'tal tmtjortance In a republic like ours
that the higher education as well as common
While we in the East have beheld with won
der anil admiration the phenomenal develop
ment of your State, we have rejoiced to see
that the erowth of the' university has even
outstripped that of the State. It is to the
great credit of this young commonwealth that
while it has, like all new States, had to bear
the heavy burden of establishing all the insti
tutions, charitable, penal, reformatory and ed
ucational, which our humane civilization de
mands, .It has ever kept in the forefront the
needs of this university and has ministered
to its wants with so generous a hand. When
older and richer States were lagging In the
support of their universities, Calltornla set the
ptlmulatlng example of establishing the 1 cent
tax, and afterward raised this to the 2 cent
tax for the maintenance of this institution. We
in the Kast gratefully acknowledge the help
which this wine act afforded as i:i {securing aid
In the same manner, even If on a less gener
ous scale. It was refreshing to us to see your
Legislature rise to the Aristotelian view of the
function of the State to seek every high and
noble end which It can secure better than the
citizen. This Idea of rherlshinj the higher
education and bringing It within the reach of
every bey and jcirl in the commonwealth has
been Inconxirated Into the very fiber and life
of the State.
President Angell addressed himself to
"The Type of the State University,"
eaying in part:
"And this is a Brown day," said
President Wheeler in closing. "I have
my brother here from Brown, my own
dear old alma mater, and I wish to
present him to you. President Angell,
born of the old college, now president
of a great State university, the Nestor
of us all."
Responding to this glowing estimate
of himself and the applause from a
multitude of hands, President Angell
expressed his pleasure th'at'bn this fes
tal day he had been permitted to bring
the salutations of the University of
Michigan to the University of Califor
nia â the greetings of the elder institu
tion to that of the younger. Referring
to the eight Michigan alumni num
bered among the faculties of the Uni
versity (of California, he said It was
with Justifiable pride that he observed
the song of Michigan so honored and
sharing in the glory of the achieve
ments of California.
TYPES OF UNIVERSITIES.
more research Is being done in the
State universities than elsewhere."
in Introducing President Angell,
President Wheeler referred to the fine
spirit of sacrifice and devotion of the
older and smaller colleges of the coun
try'. They had ideals, he said, higher
than mere bread and butter. They
trained men to be, rather than to get.
Of such are Amherst and Brown and
Williams.
Some of the students raptured were
told to pack their trunks after being
epprehejided. This was understood to
mean that the Students' Affairs Com
mitue intends to expel them. Cory
himself said to-day thai at least eight
men would be dismissed, but since
th*n other statements have been made
that such harsh measures would not
be adopted. It all depends whether
the authorities construe the presence
of the students on- the streets to be a
violation of the-' spirit of the recent
manifesto forbiddirg rushing. As most
of the rtudents were in old clothes the
authorities are rather inclined to be
lieve that they would have rushed if
they could. That they did not rush
was no fault of theirs.
The patrol carried on this system of
espionage all night. Wherever a stu
dent was caught lie was closely ex
amined before being ordered home.
Cory ordered one student handcuffed,
then searched. He was released on
promising to go home.
"Don't run. boys: dc-a't be cowards."
But some would not be pacified. They
kept on running. Out of this crowd
the patrol captured four belligerents.
They were compelled to reveal their
identity under penalty of arrest, though
neither Cory nor police had authority
to arrest any one.
As the crowd passed up Bancroft
Â¦way the !ight flashed full upon it. thus
betraying it to Cory's minions. The
crowd was not aware of the efficiency
of the organization. It stood under a
lot of trees and sent out pickets. But
before the pickets could give "the lay"
Cory and his policemen were upon
them. Some ran, some did not. Corv
said:
Some time after midnight the sopho
mores screwed up courage enough to
go out into the night. They marched
toward the university grounds. There
they were advised to make a round
about circuit. This seemed to be good
advice as the searchlight had just be
gun to put its peering eyes every
where.
The Tvhoi<Â» thing was so effectually
handled that the students didn't get
even a ebsne* . to rush. They were
kept moving all eight long. The soph
omores and the freshmen, the tra
ditional enemies on Charter day eve,
taw nothing of <-ach other. The search
light ferreted them out of every cor
ner, exposed them, betrayed them.
â¢ The sophomores made the only show
at organization. They assembled at
Ehattuck Hall early in the evening,
though there was never more than
forty of them ther^. but they were
ready for fight. Every one of them
wore sweaters and old clothes. There
Â»\as k lot of talk, but an apparent lack
cf action. The rumors that a dozen
uniform**! police from Oakland were
patrolling the campus had a demoral
izing effect upon the nerves.
Of the freshmen, there was not a
sign the whole night. Some said they
were at the Berkeley High School, but
it was as dark as Egypt all evening
down there. Others said the "fresh
ies" were fortifying themselves in Oak
land. Others told stories about seeing
them upon Charter Hill, planting the
ciass number. '07.
It r^quirpd ju*t this last solar plexus
blow to send the tottering form of the
anoient Charter day tradition to its
quietus-. It has been putting up a
game tight these last few years, des
perately clinging to the hope that the
tide might turn. But now the thing is
as dead a? Ram^sis III. Professor Cory
iÂ« the man of the hour.
There was no rush on Charter day
eve at the University of California for
the first time since the tradition was
established. Professor C. L- Cory,
chairman of the Students' Affairs Com
mittee, and his imported policemen
from Oakland and elsewhere, aided by
an innovation in the way of a high
poÂ«>r searchlight, succeeded in
FQuekhiris what threatened to be a
lush, in its inoipiency. The casualties
are eight students who may be de
prived of the pleasure of basking more
in the intellectual sunshine of the uni
versity.

"The fact is that the cost of higher
fducation is going far beyond the fig
ures that were formerly talked about.
D. O. Mills said to me recently that the
extent to which the universities are
financed on eo little is remarkable. The
truth about it Is that higher education
means research and nothing else. It
is a quest for new truths. Science
keeps putting out its pickets. It wants
men to go beyond the picket line. I And
"It sounds large â $700,000," said Presi
dent Wheeler, "but it is not anywhere
near what a great State ought to pay
for this great uplifting force. Why,
enough money was saved in one recent
intervention by the agriculturists of
this university, working in the orchards
of Placer County, to more than support
the university for one year. Something
iike $5000 was lately spent to establish
a poultry station at Petaluma, and yet
in fifteen days that amount, and much
more, was saved the State by the stif
ling of an epidemic that threatened the
poultry interest of the State. -' : .
MONEY SAVED FOR PEOPLE.
The] gift erf $600,000 for. a new library
building. President Wheeler said,- will
give a substantial structure, but before
many generations the university â¢ will
need a library worth $2,000,000. The sum
of $Â£50,000 will be available for the uni
versity this year, and of this amount
$150,000 constitutes a portion Â¦ of the
State appropriation for California Hall,
the 'remaining $700,000 being for other
purposes.
As to the needs of the university.
President Wheeler said there is certain
ly need for more fellowship funds to
help students on for two w three
years uninterrupted study after gradu
ation. There is need for a new medical
school and a hospital, for. the proper
clinical study cannot be. obtained with
out them. There is need of a schcrol of
forestry, for the State deserves it, and
more people should be stimulated in the
study of forestry. A school of naval
architecture Is necessary, a new agri
cultural building, a geology building, a
new botany building and a hall of lan
guages. .
A deep silence fell over the throng
while the Rev. Edward Lambe Par
dons, rector of St. Mark's Episcopal
Churrh. delivered the invocation. This
was followed by an address by Presi
dent Wheeler and then the introduction
of President AngHl.
President Wheeler's address -was de
voted to a review of the benefactions
of the past to the university, the pres
ent financial footing and the plans for
the future. In the course of this re
view a lBTsr.f amount of ground was
covered. All the more substantial gifts
to the university were mentioned. Most
interesting was the announcement that
Mrs. Phoebe Hearst's benefactions to
the university have been between $800,
000 or $300,000, the exact figure. Presi
dent Wheeler confessed, he could* not
tell. The expenditures upon the ,uni
verr'ty since its birth have been some
thing like $3,000,000, a sum the speaker
considered very insignificant consider
ing the benefit to humanity in a spirit
ual and material way.
LIBERAL BENEFACTIONS.
Instead of the long line of dignitaries
in somber cap and gown, with gay fac
ing?, there was a hurried formation
this morning in the armory of the gym
nasium and a straggling mounting of
steps into **ie hall above. Professor
Frank Soule, president of the day. came
first, and then President Wheeler and
President James B. Angell of the Uni
versity of Michigan, the charter day
epeaker. the other faculties and guests
and students following on.
From the stage in the gymnasium the
distinguished people looked out upon
an immense audience. Floor and gal
lery and aisles were thronging with life.
The place was becomingly decorated
with blue and gold and now and again
a motto or emblem discovered itself
among the folds of bunting. The col
ors of the nation were distinguishable,
too, in places where they contrasted
with the more somber colorings.
BERKELEY, March 23.â Charter day
at the University of California was
robbed of one cf its most imposing
spectacles â the stately procession of
men of learning in academic regalia.
The picturesque and profound feature
that has baen the conspicuous thing
on other charter days was lost to this
one, and all because the clouds wept
upon the campus. President Wheeler
hoped against fate yesterday for a sun
that would be courageous enough to
shine, but at last despair came and
he sent forth the word that the exer
cises would be entirely within doors,
and so gloomy Harmon gymnasium,
not the ciassic Greek Theater, sheltered
the hosts that came to honor the uni
versity on Its birthday.
The alumni are planning to hold an
elaborate reception In San Francisco
on the evening before Charter day of
each year. It is proposed to have the
Charter day speaker address the alumni
at that gathering.
The scheme proposed by President
Wheeler to bring the alumni into a
close organization is one that was first
successfully inaugurated at Harvard.
The Plan is^to have a permanent secre
tary for each class, and these secre
taries are to form a body in themselves.
Among^ those who discussed this new
plan at to-day's meeting were Charles
Butters. Frank Otis. William H. Waste,
George Edwards, W. H. Van Orden and,
J. M. Goss.

BERKELEY, March 23.â The Alumni
Association of California held a meet
ing this afternoon in the Philosophy
building, at which new methods for in
creasing the utility of the alumni or
ganization were freely discussed. In
stead of making a formal address Pres
ident Wheeler talked the matter over
with the graduates who were present.
In answer to their questions he. point
ed out means whereby the aiumni may
help in the matter of university legis
lation.
The exercises closed with the singing
of "America" by the audience and the
pronouncing of the benediction by the
Rev. Mr. Parsons. The university or
chestra rendered three selections dur
ing the exercises.
President Angell was the guest of
honor at a luncheon given this after
noon by President and Mrs. Wheeler
at their home. A number of distin
guished visitors were present, among:
them members of the Board of .Regents.

Leslie Falkenberg is in a fair way of
having it proved to his entire satisfac

gerous to trifle with. He appeared be
fore Judge Slogan yesterday morning
as a complaining witness, and soon
found himself a prisoner for contempt
of court, with charges of perjury and
maliciously procuring a warrant being
prepared against him. And in addition
to all that unenviable fortune he re
ceived a scathing lecture from the
bench and scorching looks from every
respectable person in the tribunal. For
j the fellow had been forced to confess
! himself thoroughly despicable. To ob
i tain revenge after a quarrel with the
mother of his two Illegitimate children
he had the woman arrested on a charge
of cruelty to the youngest of them,
and to bolster his accusation he delib
| erately lied while under oath.
Mamie Garrlty. a petite and frail
â¢ creature, who resides at 577 Natoma
, street, was the victim of Falkenbergs
| prevarication. To secure her arrest he
I represented that she was the mistress
of his brother George, a seaman, and
that although she was left sufficient
money to support herself and her 10
months-old child she cruelly neglected
the latter, and on last Sunday after
noon lefi the babe on ttiÂ« doorstep of
Â¦ the Falkenberg home, 545 Jessie street.
In court yesterday the woman swore
there was no such person as brother
George, that the complainant was the
father of heT two children and that he
contributed nothing to their support.
j Sharp questioning by Judge Mogan
compelled Falkenberg to acknowledge
that the woman told the truth, and
then he was immediately placed under
arrest for contempt and the prosecut
j ing attorney instructed to prepare
j charges of vagrancy and malicious
prosecution against him.
The woman denied that she had
abandoned her infant upon the Falk
enberg doorstep, and explained that the
j father had sent a request that she let
j him see the little one. She complied to
i the extent of taking it to his home and
! placing it in charge of his younger
j brother, saying she would call for it
! after the father had seen it. This state
j mc-nt was corroborated, and the Judge
! ordered the woman's release.
Falkenberg is about 21 years of ape

of the tenements is the position of the
grandmother, and every tenement
mother looks forward to that position," j
said Mrs. Alexander Ewing, at one of :
the monthly conferences of the Charity j
Organization Society, held yesterday J
morning in the Assembly Hall of the
United Charities Building.
"If you try to encourage a tenement !
mother by saying that her children will [
soon be grown up and able to help I
her," proceeded Mrs. Ewlng, "she # will '
tell you that when her children are ,
grown up they will not want to be
bothered with her. As an almost in
variable rule, the children do not want
the old people around. They are too
cranky, thev say. and the life of an;
aged grandmother In a tenement home
Is so Intolerable that she Is ready to
do anything to escape from it. The '
people of the tenements seldom make
any provision for their old age, but I

FRANCE UNDER THE SWORD.
FROM out the mysterious south there comes a tale
of* treasure trove more dazzling than any of the
Thousand and One Nights. A party of British and
American engineerf, while engaged, in the prosaic occu
pation of driving stakes for a survey in the mountains
of Bolivia, suddenly struck the usual "hard object which
gave forth a hollow sound," dug it .up and found that
they had uncovered $16,000,000, the buried treasure of
the Incas. For 370 years this mass of glittering wealth
had lain undiscovered, though the pot at the end of
many a treasure-seeker's rainbow, and now it goes to a
few men who happened to have luck.
Besides uncovering a comfortable store for the old
gr.ay. stocking, these engineers also unearthed a golden
truth, these many times exhumed: How cheerless and
to what little profit is the lot of the professionartreasure
seeker. With all their willow wands, their divinations
and their occult whisperings, hapless wights have been
seeking this buried treasure of the Incas for three cen
turies, wearing away their lives in an effort to find the
golden secret of^ the Andes; when along come mere en
gineers with their wooden stakes and they plump right
into Jhe Midas store with not so much as an effort.
What count the tears and the sweat of three hundred
years before the blind, clumsy luck of these fortunate
For the rnan who puts his all into the Andes or South
Sea treasure hunt, who is willing to back with his last
penny some hoary-headed old sinner of a sea-dog who
has a mysterious chart up his sleeve, the little text un
earthed with the Inca treasure should have an appealing
sound. Captain Kidd may have buried irigots like a tur
tle buries her eggs, but they are not for some small
tradesman or householder of this year' of grace to find.
The South Seas may have richness greater than that of
India's coral strand, but the race for it is not to the swift.
Let the past be keeper of its secrets. Fortune hunters
should remember the old fable .of the seve'n sons who
dug diligently the length and breadth of their orchard
for gold and found their treasure hanging from the laden
boughs oflhe trees. * i ' : â¢

T A Leap Year Conspiracy.
A prominent member of a publish

ing initiated into some of their ways
in leap year matters. It appears that
the gentleman Is not entirely unlovely
in the eyes of a very charming young
lady of San Francisco, who knows her
rights and Intends to exact them. For
some time past he has been receiving
from many of the silk houses in town
samples of very expensive silk. Think
ing it was intended for his sister, 'Tie
paid little attention to the matter. The
samples continuing, he finally asked
his sister why she didn't have her
things addressed in her own name. His
sister, who is a c^ose friend of the first
young lady spoken of, then confessed
to a dark and deep laid conspiracy.
She told her brother that If he were
at all observant he wcmld realize that
It is leap year, and that all girls have
an unwritten law that If a man re
fuses a proposal he must send as balm
to the rejected one a silk dress; also
that her girl friend had him under
serious consideration and ordered the
samples sent so that the penalty would
be ready for selection if he refused.
The victim gasped, but not to be out
done said that he, too, had a little con
spiracy and it was that before he would
be mulcted for the dress h,e would ac
cept the proposal. The samples are
still coming, so evidently the end is not
yet.
Niagara in 181 2.
How many of the thousands of
visitors who stand in awe beside the
roar of Niagara's cataract are aware
that the ground upon which they walk
was the scene of some of the bloodiest
fighting which befell in that brief and
stubborn conflict known to history a3
the War of 1S12? The Niagara fron
tier was debatable land all through,
that struggle and hardly a foot of ter
ritory on either side, from the brink
of the falls to the limits of Lewis
ton, is free from a record of patriotism
and valor.
There were many fights along this
narrow strips of gorges and rapids, but
the dark and bitter struggle at Lundy'a
Lane shows up the reddest. Both sides
claimed the victory after silence had
fallen upon the field. The tall shaft
which Canada has erected to the mem
ory of the men who fell there as
sumes the palm for England without
reserve. Historians, however, are in
doubt, and when the element of pa
triotic pride is eliminated, the battle
is written down as a drawn engage
ment. â Four-Track News.
POSTOFFICE HISTORY.
NO compilation has been made-of the history of the
* General Postoffice of the United States. That
branch of the public service is just now so much
in the focus of attention that some enterprising pub
lisher might benefit himself and the public by giving a
history of the origin, rise and progress of that depart
ment of the Government, with a sketch of the scandals
which have made it notorious.
William Penn established the first post routes ajid pos
tal facilities in this country, and the Pennsylvania legis
lative assembly authorized his postoffice in Philadelphia
in 1700. It is interesting .hat this was eleven years be
fore the- British postoffice was created by act of Parlia
ment in the reign of Queej; Anne. Soon after this Colo
nel John Hamilton securiii a royal patent to establish,
for his own profit, a geij.ral postoffice for all British
America. /This patent he! afterward sold to the Grown
and a postmaster for NorMi America was appointed. ''
In 1753 Benjamin FrankSin was appointed to this office;
and was given a deputy, a^d a salary of Â£600 was given
the two, "if they could glet it." Instead of getting it,
Franklin got into debt Â£900 in keeping up the service
and giving fast mails. He boasted that when he took
charge the round trip from Philadelphia to Boston took
six weeks and he reduced it to three. He was removed
from office by the Ministry, and was reappointed by the
Continental Congress in 1775, with a salary of $1000 per
annum, and held the place until he was sent as embassa
dor to France. He refused shin-plaster money for post
age, and asked Congress to order that only specie be
taken and this was done. Letter postage then ranged
from 11 ctnts for sixty miles t<5 33 cents for 600 miles.
In these days of graft and corruption incident to the
administration of this essentially business department of
the Government, it is interesting to read the report of
Isaac Briggs. In the' early organization of the postoffice
a class of officers called surveyors general was employed,
apparently for the purpose of surveying mail routes in
order to determine the mileage charge for carrying the
mail. Isaac Briggs,, a Quaker, was one of these survey
ors and was sent by Jefferson to survey the route to New
Orleans. The work occupied him and an assistant four
months. He reported that it was just nine hundred and
seventy-nine and five-tenths miles from the President's
house to New Orleans, and he made a map of the road.
In his final report Isaac deplored the enormous cost of
the survey, which included medical treatment, for him
self and assistant through an attack of yellow fever, and
the whole expense was $300! They had to swim all the
streams, and sleep in the night dews, and often wait for
storms to pass in order to get solar observations to fix
latitude and longitude, and it all cost $300! If the depart
ment were managed on that basis now it would pay a
large profit.
In 1839 the total roster of persons employed in the
General Postoffice, including the Postmaster General,
was only 113. In 1831 Return Jonathan Meigs, Postmaster
General, was investigated by Congress and found delin
quent for two years in payment of funds into the treas
ury. This investigation was brought about by the de
tention of a letter mailed by a member of Congress, but
which he forgot to frank. It made him angry and in his
wrath he went for the Postmaster General.. That inci
dent reminds one of current events and seems to affirm
the unchangeability of human nature. " .
The department's history shows the difficulty of gov
ernment carrying on a business, and instead of the scan
dals common to it being wonderful it is a wonder there
are no* more and worse.
Neil's of the Book World.
How many of the literary lights of
days gone by have left behind them
only some faint, lingering shadow of
thomselve* â the name of a character
or a bonmot from a book of theirs,
j/erhapa. William Combe, the creator
of "Dr. Syntax," is one of these. Pome
mterprisftjg'. bookvrorm on the Lon
don Spectator has dug down into the
X>sst and presented to present day
readers a lively sketch of this quondam
friend of Laurence Sterne: '
William Combe was born in London
in the year 1741. His parents were
wealthy people, of dubious character
(according to one account), who took
little interest in their boy. but sent
him in due course to be thrashed at
Kton, and thence, with seme rudi
ment? of Greek and Latin, to the Uni
versity of Oxford- At college he dis
tinguished himself by his vicious
habits, at a time when vice was too
common at Oxford to draw much
obloquy upon its followers. With wine
and cards and rousing the night owl in
tatthes he seems to have passed some
eighteen months at Oxford with szrtis
faction to himself, though his sudden
leaving of the college, in 1761, points
at eome unrecorded prompting from
Those in authority. He left England
for some years at this juncture to
travel in France and Italy, where he
made water-color sketches (all brown
paint and bitumen, according to the
fashion of the time), and met Laur
ence Sterne, then upon his "Senti
mental Journey."
On his return he set up as a man of
fashion, for he had a certain sum of
money in his purse, and, xve read of
him. in Bath as one of the most ex
quisite of the bloods there, going ele
gantly in flowered silk. He was tall
nnd of extreme beauty, a dark, hard
some fellow of a commanding pres
ence. He was a brilliant talker and
at all points "the fine gentleman." He
kept always two carriages and a host
of footmen. His sword, no doubt, was
a dainty thing in steel and silver. His
manner was the Rape of the Lock in
human terms.
Dice and the giving of bouquets, wine
and th<? paying of the reckoning, at last
sent his laces to pawn and the gilt es
tablishment to auction. There was
nothing else to be done. The' money
was gone. And the fine friends, no
â¢loubt, with the scented perukes drop
ping powder upon the silken coats,
< rept away upon tiptoe, with thin lips
curved in a sneer, glad that the golden
guineas had come to them from one so
spendthrift, so wasteful, as William
Combe had been. Kvidence shows that
the smash was like the" breaking of
porcelain, complete and final, and
Combe's conduct appears to have been
l<randed with several ugly termsâ
â¢fraudulent," "dishonorable," "dastard
ly." etc We see a very frightened and
frowsy William Combe dodging down
the hedgerows toward the sea, toward
sorae Calais packet, out of reach
cf clutching catchpolls, out of reach of
the grim haunts known as the Fleet,
the King's Bench,, the Marshal sea.
There was to be no more scent and silk
and delicacy for many years. Nothing

ranks, in a red coati with floured hair

Whether he tired of glory, as glory
showed to a private soldier shortly be
fore the- Revolution, we do not know;
but be found means to lay aside his
Fhare of it and to become a waiter in a
tavern. This proved to be a step to
vard promotion as a cook, and as a
cook he wqrked for several months,
finally returning .to London, to spend
various years In prison for debt. We do
not know when he began to write as a
journalist, though no doubt it was be
fore the end of the century. It was in
1*12 that his writing began to be
known, for in that year Ackermann,
the print and book seller, bought a se
ries cf plates from Rowlandson repre
senting the travels of a quaint clergy
nan . through various parts of the
country. Ackermann cast about for
â¢tome one? to write a tale in verse to fit
ihese plates and hit upon Combe, who

The success of the book was imme

*<i these were illustrated by the coarse,
living pictures of Rowlandson. and all
sold well, though npne so well as the
first book of the series.
The scries came to an end fn 1821.

THE country will be gratified by the brief and
pointed instructions given by the President to the
Canal CommjssKrfners. Their work is the greatest
that man has undertaken, and its prompt and proper per
formance is to be the test of American capacity and en
ergy. We were the . pioneers in difficult railroad con
struction. Our first transcontinental line preceded the
Russian project for the Siberian road by thirty-six years.
The Hoosac tunnel was finished before the Alpine tun
nels to connect France and Italy, and these got their
spiral form for overcoming tirade from the Tehachapi
loop on the Southern Pacific. In all that branch of en
gineering and construction that concerns railways we
led the world, and accomplished what had been held to
be impossible.
All great canal construction heretofore accomplished
has been easy compared with that to be, done on the
isthmus. Some of it has been conspicuously slow. The
Corinth canal was begun b / efore the Chn .tian era, and
was finished in the last 'five years. The Suez canal was
an easy construction, and its principal difficulty was
political, rather than in its engineering. The nations
concerned had to make sure that all interests, in war and
peace, were' balanced. The isthmian canal which we now
undertake has been the victim, of politics. One hundred
and forty-two years ago the King of Spain instructed his
colonial governor on the isthmus to rigidly exclude all
Englishmen from that territory, lest they see the vast
advantages that would follow . the digging of a canal.
That was a political reason, and from that time until the
Panama revolution put isthmian politics on the side of a
canal international politics has been an obstruction.
The downfall of the French project was due to the
domestic politics of that republic. De Lesseps had to
bribe and buy his way through the antagonism of parties
and officials, and lost in these corrupt subsidies the cap
ital intended for the completion of the work. Our posi
tion is happily different from his, and we have taken all
the preliminary steps in cleanness and propriety. Not
withstanding ill-advised attempts to rob one party of
honorable participation in the matters introductory to
the great work, nearly half of its Senators broke away
from faulty leadership, and took for themselves and their
constituency a due share of the honor. The enterprise is
launched in the name of the American people, and every
citizen has a right to feel his proper share of the re
sponsibility.
The President's instructions to the commission dis
miss partisanship utterly from the work. The Commis
sioners were selected without seeking knowledge as to
their partisan bias, but only for their fitness for the work.
No men were ever left'a freer rein in a great work than
they. Only the President can remove them, and he told
them that they are to be judged solely by their work, and
if any fail he will be removed no matter what political in
fluence he may bring to bear. He admonished them to
follow the same rule in selecting their subordinates that
had guided him in selecting them, and to make unfitness
the sole cause for removal. This gives a free hand to the
commission. â¢
The President's instructions will bear many readings.
They form a business document that should be posted
in every executive office in the Union, whether it be the
office of a Governor or of the president or manager of a
corporation or a great business enterprise. The docu
ment will enhance the reputation of the President as a
man of business and of action. It has a moral feature
that is impressive. Instead of lecturing the Commis
sioners on the need of honesty in the work, he said that
if any of them needed such admonition he would not
have been appointed. That is a very high expression and
opens a new thought applicable to tlte discipline of those
who hold trusts. Perhaps many lapses are due to harp
ing upon honesty, that would not occur if men holding
trusts were told that they had been chosen because they
needed no admonition to be honest.
Now the work begins in the plans which will be under
way while the Government is completing the acquisition
of the rights of the French company, and is settling the
subsidy payment with Panama. When these financial
arrangements are -finished the commission will have its
plans, in condition for disclosure to the country. We are
not aware that any decision is made as to whether the
canal shall operate with locks or be a tide level water
way. If it can be majde the latter we are sure that the
people will be better satisfied.' Locking delays the tran
sit of ships and adds to the cost of administration. A
sea level ditch will cost more and take more time' in con
struction, but it will save more than its cost. It will be
more satisfactory to ship owners and masters, and will
better serve the purposes of commerce.
The Magic Word.
An insane person Is hard to handle,
particularly when the poor creature
happens to be violent. To subdue one
whose mfnd is gone is sometimes a
dangerous task and one th/t often re
quires the combined strength of three
or four men. Quite frequently, how
ever, one mentally deranged can be
quieted by a single person who has a
slight knowledge of the mania of ths
unfortunate.
This- was exemplified the other day
at the hospital for the insane at the
City Hall. In one of the cells was a
young English sailor. He was, to use
a common expresion, "as crazy as a
loon." He yelled and yelled, and the
stewards could not make him keep
quiet, though they tried every means
within their knowledge. Even when
they strapped his arms and legs and
threw a blanket over his head he
yelled. :
Finally, when every one about the
place was worn out. Deputy Sheriff
Tom Whelan, who has been handling
maniacs of every description for years,
came in.
"Why don't you make that fellow
stop yelling?" he asked the stewards.
"We cannot," they replied.
"Who is he?" asked Tom.
"A young English sailor," was the
response.
With only this slight knowledge
Tom walked into the seaman's cell.
He stood over the cot occupied by the
unfortunate, raised his hand in a
threatening manner, and in a voice
that would have done credit to the
biggest bully on a windjammer shout
ed:
"Shut up, blast you, or I'll crack
your skull with a handspike."
At the word handspike the loud
yells erf the young sailor ceased. He
whimpered and with a very subdued
"Aye, aye, sir," turned his face to the
wall. For hours after he did not ut
ter a sound and when late in the af
ternpon he coramepced yelling again a
repetition of the deputy sheriff's
threat caused him to become quiet
immediately.
thought of its readers. And, by for
tune, It is most admirably illustrated.
J. M. Barrie of "Little Minister"
fame; took occasion to give his views
on the modern drama at the annual
dinner of the Playgoers' Club recently.
He said that there was no reason why
ths more ignoble and mean side of man
should not be treated on the stage as
well as any other. There was hardly
any subject unfitted for treatment on
the stage. It all depended how it was
done. But it so happened that near'y
all the recent plays which had been
performed had been plays that treated
or man from that point of view, and
the result had been that all the im
itators that had sprung up had been
serious from that point of view also,
and that serious plays had come to
mean Jn the minds of many persons
plays dealing with rather unpleasant
subjects. One might also come to think
that a man would be rather uninterest
ing if he did not give way to passion,
and that a woman would not be very
charming If she had retained much
modesty. It seemed a pity. He was
not at all sure that when the really
big dramatist . for whom they were
waiting appeared, he would not find
and show to them that people were not,
perhaps, quite so badâ even serious
peopleâ as they seemed to be when
represented on the stage.
In issuing the second six volumes of
bis edition known as "The Stage
Shakespeare," Austin Brereton, the
London man of letters, reminds us that
"there Is always room at the top."
Crowded as the booksellers of the world
may be with editions of the poet-dra
matiet, whose vogue is an eternal one,
and whose sacro-sanctity is secure
from higher criticism and from illiter
ate neglect, there is good cause and
reason for adding to the existing sup
ply so handy and attractive an edition
as this one. The text, which is clearly
printed," is taken by permission of
Messrs. Macmillan & Co., from the
Globe edition of 1900. But Mr. Brereton
has approached the plays from a stand
point that is of very actual interest.
In the introductions, marked by charm
and scholarship, for which he is re
sponsible, Mr. Brereton lays most stress
on the stage history of the plays. He
deals with the characters fully and
with excellent judgment, and gives ex
tracts from many sources of Shakes
pearean criticisms, while the stage his
tory of each play is treated with carÂ»
and liberality. But perhaps the mo3t
interesting feature of this edition is
the series of Illustrations. These are
taken, for the mo6t part, from photo
graphs of those who have appeared in
the plays on the modern stage. But
the older actors are not left out of it
altogether, and reproductions of well
known pictures give the necessary
variety. The present set, complete in
a handy little case, comprises "King
Henry V," "King Henry "VIII,"
"Twelfth Night," "The Winter's Tale."
"Othello" and "Much Ado About Noth
ing." A warm welcome .should be as
sured for these and the remaining vol
umes. They are not to be despised by
the student and they will attract thos,Â»
who do not claim so high a distinction.
The Book Monthly is of the opinion
that the growth of the custom of liv
ing in flats is a blow to the book trade.
Its reasoning is as follows: There is
no room in the average 'flat for book
cases. Consequently people who live
in flats cannot keep any large num
ber of books. They therefore cease
to buy books and depend for their
reading on the circulating libraries.
This may be true, -but surely there
are not enough people living in flats
in all England seriously to affect the
book trade. Besides, if it be true that
there is not room m flats for libraries,
why should not the flat dwellers buy
pocket editions that will take up very
little room? Perhaps*, now that we
think of it, the recent multiplicity of
pocket editions is due to the exigen
cies of flat life. The pocket edition
is, of course, a misnomer. No man
carries books in his pocket, for the
sufficient reason that books so car
ried utterly spoil one's pockets. More
over, no man wants to have a book
always at hand, so that. he can read It
while he is waiting on the corner for
a bus. or having his boots blacked on
the sidewalk. , Pocket editions must
be published either in the interest of
oculists and opticians, who reap a har
vest from the owners of eyes that have
been injured by reading fine print, or
they must be designed for people who
live in flats. It really looks as if the
latter were the case.

The split infinitive has always had
its sturdy advocates, but the weight
of opinion has been against it, and
proofreaders and editors have generally
had their way when it came to ex
cising' it from manuscripts and proofs.
Professor Lounsbury of Yale has taken
up the cudgels, in behalf of the prac
tice. He declares that it has survived
the. assaults ot five centuries, more
or less, and he Is confident that It will
prevail. In an article in the April Har

that the split infinitive adds both clear

to bolster up Russia by force of arms, for when the con
vention was consummated such a need on the part of
Russia entered not at all ,in the calculations; but the
spirit of the alliance certainly does convey the note of
moral obligation on the part of France if only for the
sake of expediency. Should* the affairs of the Muscovite
reach a dangerous crisis in the present war and France
be tardy in her offer of aid, as surely as the ice pack
moves down the Neva would France find herself be
tween^the channel and Alsace-Lorraine, utterly alone.
With ', this serious problem to face, it is certain the
government of M. Loubet will move with great caution.
A misstep in either direction might mean war. The
third republic has never had the test of war save that
which gave it baptism. With the Bonapartists and the
Bourbons hovering about in the near foreground, the
republic might not have the strength to withstand the
shock of conflict.

TRESPASSâ C. "W. A.. Novato, Cal.
It does not follow that in order to b<Â»
guilty of trespass on the property of
another the Individual trespassing com
mtt an act that damages the property.
The mere entering upon the land of
another without permission of the
owner is a trespass. If an Individual

stream that runs through the? land
without the permission of the owner,
that Is trespass.
PERSISTENT press reports concerning thecjfectof
the present war in the Far East upon the diplo
matic balance of Europe credit France with a
strong desire to co-operate with Great Britain in the offer
to patch up the broil in the Orient. While the German
Emperor seems to be* feeling the itch of the war bug
with every report of a Russian defeat, Russia's ally is do
ing everything in- its power to get Russia safely out of
the war even if honor alone remains. "Continued strife
in the East, no matter upon which side the scale of vic
tory be turned, is a grave menace to the welfare of
France.
With the forces of the Cxar in retreat, as they seem
to be at present, and with the Japanese fleet supreme in
the China Sea, France is brought to, face a peril perhaps
greater than^any she has had to cope with since the
Treaty of Versailles. For France is at the present mo
ment endeavoring to perform the difficult feat of carry
ing water on both shoulders. By the articles of the
dual alliance with Russia, France is bound to see to it
that Russia does not have to oppose Japan and England
combined. On the other hand, the growing entente
cordialc between herself and her neighbors across the
channel, a circumstance which has allowed France "an
easier feeling than she has had for many a year, makes
it almost imperative upon . her that she preserve the
present comfortable status. France's Russian. alliance is
indispensable, since, as Sydney Brooks says in the cur
rent Atlantic, the bond gives France "security" among
the powers. The arbitration treaty between France and
Great Britain is too manifest a tolcen of good will to
permit of any doubt of the desires of both governments.
The tide of victory which has carried Japan into an
almost undisputed possession of Korea would seem to
guarantee tljat Great Britain will not be called upon to
become an active ally in the field. The ietter of. the dual
alliance does not stipulate that France is in > duty- bound

day Lenten services In the rooms of

merce, under the auspices of thf*
Brotherhood of St. Andrew* of the Epis
copal church, increase in popularity,
as is evidenced by the attendance. Th<j
nature of the addresses and the prom
inence of the speakers has in a meas
ure been responsible for the great in
terest manifested by the business com
munity and it can be said that th<*
passion week services this year have
been the most successful since the in
auguration of the custom. There will
be three more of the noon services â
Dr. David Starr Jordan, president of
Leland Stanford Jr. University, speak
ing to-day on "Righteous Citizenship in
Public Spirit"; General N. P. Chipman,
Supreme Court Commissioner, giving
his views to-morrow on "Righteous
Citizenship in the Vote," and the Right
Rev. W. P. Nichols, D.D., Bishop of
California, delivering the last address
of the week Saturday on "Righteous
Citizenship in the Church."
The services yesterday were similar
to the preceding: ones and the attend
ance was large. Rev. Frederick W.
Clampett, rector of Trinity Church, had
been assigned the subject of "Righteous
Citizenship in the Home" and delivered
a most forceful and stirring address.
In his opening remarks he said a mod
ern writer had designated as the two
sweetest words in the English tongue
'home" and "mother." No matter how
robust a man may be, no word appealed
so strongly to him as the one that
brings associations of mother. "Horn*
is the sweetest spot on earth," said the
speaker, "and it should be the treasury
of man, his wife and family. If a man's
character is to be tested it should nqt
be done in the church or the stock ex
change, but under his own roof, where
he lives day by day. The citizen who
is true in citizenship must be true in
the hot^ff."
Dr. Clampett then maintained that
the churches were not alive to-day as
they should be to the phases of home
1 life and cited the lack of filial respect
and regard in the growing generation.
The subject of divorce received a scath
ing rebuke at the hands of the learned
divine. He said:
It Is a most serloui consequence that the
church anJ Â«tate are In conflict over thlÂ«
question of niarriece and divorce, and still
; pr?atÂ«Â»r that thÂ« churches are In conflict amonR

in court, yet these who art? sent from my

"We knew that Mr. Thompson, our
neighbor', had been acting queerly for
some time, but we did not think he
was dangerous. His actions gave ua
all a pretty good scare."
Thompson has been living at the
home place with his mother and sister.
The warrant for Thompson's arrest
was given to Officer Forgle, Who had
considerable trouble in landing the
man at the Receiving Hospital. On his
arrival at Thompson's home he was
encountered by Lucy Thompson, who
gave him a hard fight, at ihe same
time yelling to her brother to make
his escape. .Thompson ran, but was
overtaken by the officer, who, after a
short struggle, handcuffed the man
and took him to the detention ward of
the Receiving Hospital, where he will
be held pending an examination.
Then the unexpected caller departed,
but Instead of crossing the street to
his home attempted to scale a fence
and to enter a house next door to the
Carlton place. Dr. Carlton succeeded
at last In calming his visitor sufficient
ly to induce him to leave the place and
go home.
Thompson got to the window â¢ by
crawling up a step ladder he had placed
beneath it.
Miss McWalter said:
Dr. Carlton, by coolness and tact,
managed to handle Thompson and to
get his unwelcome visitor ont of the
house without serious consequences.
" Thompson is deemed erratic. Chief
of Police Hodgkins said the pioneer
Oaklander's eon had once been examin
ed in San Francisco for Insanity, but
had been discharged.
Mary McWalter, the domestic, was
awakened by the rattling of the win
dow shutters in her room. She saw a
man climbing into the room, and with
a scream of fright fled, pursued by
Thompson, who was stopped by Dr.
Carlton and Mrs. Carlton, both of
whom rushed into a hallway after be
ing aroused by the girl's cries. Recog

he persisted so emphatically that the
aroused householder accompanied him
through the residence.

Mrs. Kart has been busily engaged in
Seattle and other northern cities talk
ing about the Alaskan exhibit and in
giving information about Alaska. She
will remain in this city several days as
a gruest of Mrs. Madge Morris Wagner
at t'j% Noe street.
The Alaska, building at St. Louis will
be in the colonial style of architecture.
Flanking this building will be Alaskan
houses, exact reproductions of those
that aie common In Alaska. A choice
collection of large and elaborately
carved totem poles will serve two pur
poses. One leading object is to have
them attract attention to the Alaskan
exhibit, which they are likely to do In
view of the fact that they will be not
far from a main entrance to the expo
sition grounds, and their height will
make them loom up in full view from the
"Pike," which is the Midway of the St.
Louis show. The second object In hav
ing the totem poles Is to reproduce an
Alaskan vista as nearly as possible.
Amid the totem poles the bulbs gath
ered by the children of Alaskan schools
will be planted, and with due care in
the proper season they will blossom
payly for the credit of the land that is
their habitat.
Mrs. Mary E. Hart, lady manager for
the Alsakan exhibit at the St. Louis
Exposition, returned from Puget Sound
yesterday. She says arrangements have
keen made to reproduce at St. Louis a
scene illustrative of the vegetation of
Alaska. To accomplish this the teach
ers of Alaskan schools will instruct
their pupils to gather slips and bulbs.
and these will be so cared for that they
i\ m bear transportation to St. Louis. It
is expected that a very large percent
age of them will thrive and so aid In
the creation of a characteristic Alaskan
garden scene.
It is an open question whether there

not file a petition and that the dele
gates elected to the State' convention
will resolve themselves Into a Con
gressional district convention. Superior
Judge A. G. Burnett of Sonoma and W.
P. Hammon of Butte .will probably be
chosen as delegates from the district
to the Chicago convention.
In affairs pertaining to the Third
Congressional District the leading Re
publicans of Alameda'and Solano coun
ties usually come together and make
up a Elate without recognizing the ex
istence of Contra Costa County. The
last-named county is becoming too im
portant to be longer Ignored. Richmond
is growing with marvelons rapidity.
All along the bay south and west from
Martinez to the county line population
Is increasing. Before many years roll
by somebody from Contra Costa County
may go to Congress.
There is gossip In 'the Republican
camp of the Third District that George
Only one of the two Congressional
committees in the Fourth District can
be recognized by the Secretary of State
as the governing body of the Republi
can party in the district. The petitions,
if not already filed at Sacramento, will
be filed, to-day.
District conventions to elect delegates
to the National Republican Convention
at Chicago will be held in the Fourth
and Fifth Congressional districts of this
State. The district delegates will be
chosen at the primary election May 3.
Initial steps for yie filing of the neces
sary petitions have been taken by the
Congressional committee of each dis
trict. These district conventions will, be
entirely separate from the Republican
State Convention, which has been
called to meet in Sacramento May 18
for the purpose of electing four dele
gates at large and four alternates to
the national convention of the party.
Very likely- many of the delegates to a
Congressional district convention may
be chosen to represent their respective
Assembly districts in the State conven
tion. '
Word comes from the north that
Charles Clinch of Grass Valley and J.
C. Bull of Eureka will .be chosen: to
represent the First Congressional Dis
trict. It is common gossip that the
Congressional committee in the First
will not issue a call for a district con
vention. Therefore under the call is
sued by the Republican State Central
Committee, acting in harmony with the
directions of the Republican National
Committee, the delegates elected to the
State convention from the, counties
comprising the First Congressional Dis
trict will elect the delegates from said
district to the national convention.

On motion of J. D. Brown the chair
man and secretary were authorized to
file the necessary petitions with the
Secretary of State.
RECOGXIZMS PRIMARY jLAW.
The call for the district convention
adopted by the committee recognizes
the primary election law and provides
that delegates to the convention shall
be chosen at the primary election on
Tuesday, May 3. The temporary roll
of delegates will be made up by the
chairman and secretary of the Con
gressional District Committee.
The Fourth Congressional District
Committee, of which Louis EL Ander
son is chairman and Martin Kelly sec
retarj-, has issued a call for the conven
tion to meet in San Francisco on Wed
nesday, May 18, at 8 p. m. It is pro
vided that the convention shall consist
of 230 delegates, under a flat appor
tionment of twenty-five delegates to
each of the ten Assembly districts. The
delegates are to be elected under the
provisions of the primary election law
on Tuesday, May 3.
The following significant paragraph
is contained in the call for the Kelly
Congressional District Convention:
; "That the delegates elected or select
ed to the Republican State Convention
to be held in Sacramento on the 18th
day of May, 1904, to elect delegates to
the National Republican Convention at
Chicago, shall not be eligible nor per
mitted to sit or act as delegates in the
conventiorf*to be held under this call,
and such delegates from said Fourth
Congressional District to said Repub
lican State Convention shall not be em
powered or authorized to elect or select
district delegates from said Fourth
Congressional District to said Repub
lican National Convention."
A meeting of the Republican Con
gressional Committee, Fourth District,
was held at 16 Geary street last even
ing. The members of the committee
in attendance were Leon Samuelp,
Twenty-ninth Assembly District; L. A.
Devoto, Thirtieth District; Maurice L.
Asher, Fortieth; Robert Grier, Forty
second; Philip Haskinss, Forty-third;
Ed Buckley, Forty-fifth, and J. D.
Brown, Charles M. Fisher and Luther
Elkins, committeemen at large.
On motion of J. D. Brown, M. L.
Asher was called to the chair. Phil
Haskins was authorized to act as sec
retary. After considerable discussion
the committee adopted a call for a Re
publican Congressional Dfstrict Con
vention to select two delegates and
two alternate delegates to the National
Republican Convention at Chicago. It
is provided in the call that the district
convention shall be held in San Fran
cisco at 8 p. rn., Friday, May 20, 190-1.
The convention will consist of sixty
eight delegates, apportioned to Assem
bly districts as follows: â¢

cursions on the electric . railroads to

" BERKELEY, March 23. â In a game
replete with clever fielding and heavy
batting the University of California
baseball team succeeded in defeating
the alumni team to-day by a score of
3 to l.^The varsity showed great im
provement over its performances of
last week. West of the dental col
lege was tried out in the box for the
first time, pitching four innings. He
held the alumni down to five hits. At
that point Heitmuller, the -regular
varsity pitcher, replaced him and fin
ished the game. His work for a
while was a little wild, but he soon
steadied down 'and pitched good ball.
Bliss' place behind the bat was taken
by Strub, anotrier dental college man.
Four former captains of varsity
nines played on the alumni . team.
They were Goslinsky, Elston, Hoag
and Hamlln. Parker, a former Stan

Interest among devotees of the old Iiish

Egan recently went to Ireland and de
feated Twcrhill, the greatest player in

the past year and during his stay he
has shown his skill by defeating Al
Hampton, Collins, Jimmy White, Midgy
Maguire, Henry Corey, Jack Bonnet,

Tim McGrath. v.hu was a passenger
in the car, said he was glad he was
not the man who had posted Corbett's
J2500 forfeit guaranteeing his appear
ance in the ring. The champion is &
daring chauffeur and the way he drove
that car was startling. It seems a
safety valve for his surplus energy and
gives him some exciting recreation.
The betting seemed to reach its level
yesterday when the odds settled at 10
to 6, with Corbett favorite. This was
the prevailing price throughout the
afternoon and evening and some of the
authorities on betting believe these
figures will remain unchanged. There
is more Corbett money than Britt
money in sight, but the men who want
to wager it refuse to accept less than
6 to 10. It is the opinion of many ex
perts that the latter is a false price'
and that the legitimate odds should be
S to 10.
Each boxer is betting on himself,
Biitt sending in a larger commission
The utmost secrecy is still maintained
about his weight, but, like Jimmy Britt,
he expects to retire to-night at weight.
This means both boxers brill take but
gentle exercise to-morrow to keep them
at the required figure.
Corbett expected to meet Harry Pol
lock, his manager, who was due from
New York last night. The train was
twenty hours late, thus making him
duo here this afternoon. After Corbett
finished his work yesterday he dressed
himself warmly and came into town in
hiR automobile.
BETTING SETTLES DOWN.
Corbett looked better yesterday than
at any time since he first appeared on
this coast. He seemed fairly bursting
with health and with good nature. His
eyes were sparkling and his flesh had a
ruddy glow. He went at his work with
a vim, having lost the lackadaisical air
vrlth which he was accustomed to per
form his gymnasium work when train-
Ing for other fights.
He apparently feels his future is
Flaked on this fight, and he is leaving
nothing undone to fit himself for what
appears the hardest battle of his career.
A big crowd visited Corbett's quar
ters at the beach yesterday. In the
morning Corbett went the entire length
of the park and return, a distance of
about ten mn>s. He alternated his pace
between jogging and sprinting and fin
ished in good shape. From the way he
bundled himself up for his gymnasium
Â¦work in the afternoon it was evident
he wanted to take off some weight. He
also had the stove in the gymnasium
contributing toward the warmth of the
occasion.
COUBETT'S VISITORS
Jimmy Britt and Young Corbett each
put in a good day's work yesterday and
pleased their admirers with the man
ner In which they went throuch their
paces.
It is the consensus of opinion among
men well Qualified to judge that no
two athletes ever approached a ring con
test In better condition than these two
boye are in. Britt's friends do not try
to conceal their delight in his condi
tion. He seems to be getting down to
the reauired weight without sacrificing
any of his strength, but rather build-
Ing up in hitting power and activity.
If nothing goes amiss with him until
he appears et Woodward's Pavilion to
morrow nicht he will have no excuses
to offer in case of defeat. He was never
in such condition before. He Is hover
ing close to the ISO-pound mark, and
could easily reach it within a few
hours if necessary. His spirits are of
the best, and with the battle of his
career but forty-eight hours awav he
if as confident as ever he wa* when
ready for his past encounters. His
work yesterday was practically the
same as thÂ» programme he has pursued
during the week â a run on the road In
the morning and several hours of light
exercise in the gymnasium in the after
noon, followed by a rub down and a
star chamber lecture from Spider
Kelly, Jimmy's head trainer. An air
of hopefulness pervades the Britt
camp, and all of those who have as
sisted and watched Jimmy in his train
ing course say he will etep into the
ring to-morrow night prepared to bat
tle any man of his weight to a finish.

post a good second, and Ilanna arrived
with third honors. In the final of the
220-yard hurdle Frel was winning by a
block, but fell down at the last hurdle.
Hume and Meany then passed him
without any difficulty.
Trainer Walter Christie was well sat
isfied with the showing made by the
men. They have had little or no prac
tice, as the track has been covered with
water most of the time. Some promis
ing youngsters were brought out. and It
is expected many of them will perform
in good style when the Intercollegiate
meet is held. Summary:
A large field waa entered In the two
mile race. The finish of this event was
a hot one, Tibbitts and Hackley running
a dead heat, with Wheeler third by sev
eral lengths. Johnston and Zacharlaa
also tied for first place in the third heat
of the 220-yard dash, which was finally
won by Snedigar. with Zacharlas sec
ond and Johnston third.
The college championship field day at
the University of California track yes
terday afternoon was not a brilliant
event by many lengths. The cinder
path was slow and mushy and the ath
letes had a hard time In getting over
the ground, so there was not a chance
of breaking any running records.
A fairly good crowd was In attend
ance, and the favorites were cheered
when they came home first In any of
the various events. A large number of
men were entered, and some of the fin
ishes were close and exciting. The only
notable performance of the day was
that of Sperry. who put the shot 43 feet
and 2 inches, breaking the college rec
ord.
Homage, at 3 to 1, won the first racÂ«
from Innsbruck, with Little Secret
third.
The two-year-old event furnished a
surprise, Speaker Fontana winning
easily from Devon B, and Sinicado, the
7 to 10 favorite, was third.
Eugenie B, favorite for the third race
over the Slauson course, led all the way
and won by a nose from Barrington,
with Foncasta third.
The fourth race was the best of the
day, every horse receiving support from
the talent. Labor was heavily played
at 11' to 5 and Best Man at 2 to 1. Many
fancied Straggler at 5 to 1, while Dur
bar arid Buccleuth were not without
backers at sixes. Straggler went to the
front at the start and won all the way.
Buccleuth, from a poor start, ran a
good race \ and finished second, ahead
of Best Man.
Redan stepped the Slauson course in
1:11% in the fifth race, winning handily
from Agnes Mack at 50 to 1, with Pri
vateer, the favorite, third.
Merwan took the last event, leading
all the way and beating Erie and Mr.
Robinson in the order named. Merwan
was 4 to J in the betting.

LOS ANGELES, March 23.âNotwith
standing a rainfall amounting to two
and a half inches last night, the Ascot
track was in fine shape this afternoon,
and the time made under the conditions
was remarkably fast. A good pro
gramme furnished a fine day's sport
and. the talent was successful In most
cases. Favorites were not generally suc
cessful; but there was a strong play on
the liberal priced second and third
choices.
As usual, the remarkable Rube
Waddell is in trouble. He evidently
forgets he has signed up with Portland
and no one knows his whereabouts.
But nevertheless Rube cannot play
hall â¢ elsewhere. He will probably
make a_Jively move within the next
I few days, for he has been in eclipse
I for a lone time.
The Oakland grounds will not be
ready for two weeks yet, so the games
next Sunday morning and Tuesday
afternoon will be played on the old
field at Golden Gate. Umpire Colgan
is ill and did not report, so Jack Mc-
Carthy has kindly consented to act
in his stead. He will judge the initial
game this afternoon. The teams will
line ud as follows:
San Francisco. Positions. Seattle.
Leahy Catcher Blankenship
Whalen or Hughes. Barber
Yerkes Pitchers or Williams
llassey Finst base Brasher
Andersen Second base Mohler
Irwin Third base Delehanty
Schmeer ;. ShortEtop Hall
Hlldebrand IWt field Frisk
'Waldron Center fiold Van Haltren
Meany Right field Smith
WADDELL. IX TROUBLE.
The balance of the team* is fairly
i well known. Second Baseman Andy
Anderson and Shortstop Claude
Schmeer performed for Portland last
year and everybody knows them. Hil
debrand learned how to play the
game under the watchful eye of
Hank and has returned unto the fold
after straying away. Waldron, Yerkes
and Bert Jones are the strangers, but
I Uncle assures us they will not be
j strangers long, for each man is cap
able of doing what is right In his re
spective line.
Manager Morley of the Los Angeles
I team will not be allowed to play Dil-
I Ion to-day. President Bert notified
I him last night that he could not use
j the big first baseman unless he could
; show the latter had been released by
I Hanlon of Brooklyn. Manager Harris
notified President Ferrall of the Na
tional Association that his claim on
Grauchnaur still held and therefore
the latter will not be permitted to play
ball any place but in San Francisco.
There are a few members of the
j home team who will be well and fa
j vorably remembered. For instance,
; Tommy Leahy, who played the best
1 ball of any backstop in the league last
Â¦ year. Then there are Captain Char
i ley Irwin, silent Pat Meany, the mild
} mannered Jimmy Whalen and â¢*" cute
j Winnie Cutter. These men are looked
upon as top liners and much will de
1 pend on their work during the season.
Everything looks right for a good
and a prosperous ball season. The
teams appear evenly matched and the
race gives promise of developing into
an exciting affair. San Francisco made
good against the mighty Chicago Na
tional Leaguers last Monday and if
they are able to keep up a stride like
that there may be danger of the pen
nant landing here.
Seattle is represented by a team of
sluggers. Each man on the team,
with a couple of exceptions. Is noted
for his ability to line 'em out, and if
the home pitchers do not look wise
there is every likelihood of big do
ings to-day.
OLD-TIME FAVORITES.
There will be no parade, but simply
a ball game, and the management
"fcays it will be a dream. James Wha
len or Stanley Yerkes are carded to
twist 'em for Uncle, and either Jimmy
Hughes, Xick Williams or "Bay Rum"
Barber will perform for Park Wilson's
colts.
The merry music of the base hit
and the zing of the ball against the
mitt will be in order to-day at the
Eighth-street ball park, after an ab
sence of four months, an absence that
has made the heart of the faithful fan
grow fonder. S:Cn Francisco will line
up against Seattle and the game will
be called at 3 o'clock, if the rain does
not Interfere.

G. A. Wahlgreen, secretary of the

Derby will be a big event this year and
Toledo will be among the starters.
ENTRIES FOR TO-DAY.
Charley McCafferty*s Mr. Farnum
failed to make it three straight, losing
the mile and a furlong event to
Byronerdale. The former horse open
ed up favorite,^ but the play on Byron
erdale was such a steady one that the
Crane entry had the call around post
time. As usual Mr. Farnum went out
in front and stayed there until the
paddock was approached, when Trav
ers, on the favorite, drew up danger
ously close and Smith on the pace
maker drew his whip. Byronerdale
then won out in a reck finish. The
Fretter took the show after "much ill
racing luck.
Henrj^ Spencer, the original "Ice
man," did the books an unintentional
favor by getting beaten astride the
7 to 10 favorite, Celebrant, in the clos
ing Futurity cpurse sprint. Henry
plainly displayed a lack' of practice,
riding a poor race. He let his mount
drop back going the first 100 yards.
In the run to the wire he was unable
to overhaul the 10 to 1 outsider, Gate
way, ridden by Crosswaite, and, finish-,
Ing down in the trench # next the out
side fence, was defeated by more than
a length. Eight lengths farther back
Atwood dropped into the show.
XOTES OF THE TRACK.
Four favorites tied up at their moor
ings first, and until the downfall of
Celebrant the books were all far be
hind financially. The handicap attract
ed a large attendance. ;
Foxy Grandpa at 7 to 10 was the first
favorite to step over the plate in front.
The black colt seemingly outclassed his
company, but was well hustled
throughout by Travers, finally beating
Inspector Munro half a length. Ho
meric, at odds of 30 to 1, ran third.
Jack Little ran a poor race under Bon
ner's guiding hand.
Following this came the very easy
win of Sol I,ichtenstein. The black
gelding is a heavy headed individual,
and as it was thought that Holbrook
might prove too light to manage him
the odds went from 7 to 5 to 12 to 5.
Sol had the lead before the stretch
was reached and won under reefed sails
from Educate. Pure Dale again dis
played a lack of staying qualities, los
ing the show to Adirondack. Otis was
thrown from the back of My Surprise
at the start, escaping without injury.
No doubt the presence in the saddle
of Jack Martin caused Muresca to be
installed an 8 to 5 favorite for the third,
a six-furlong selling sprint. The mare
shines on a sloppy track, but the
go-Ing yesterday was too heavy and
holding, with a result that C. Smith on
Quiz II, the second choice, scored an
easy first. Florestan finished third,
more than three lengths behind the
first choice. Wolhurst went to the post
for the first time in many moons, look
ing big and high. He could not scare
up a gallop.
JIK. FARXUM FAILS.
FOUR FAVORITES liAXD.
"Big BJH" Knapp, seated on the back
of Puerl Wilkerson'8 Warte Nicht, cap
tured the $1000 handicap, over one and
a sixteenth miles, decided yesterday at
Oakland track. Warte Nicht carried 10G
pounds, and as he was always partial
to heavy going and the footing was
holding enough to pull the plates from
the horses' hoofs the son of Fonso ruled
the favorite.
P. Ryan brought Ben MacDhui out of
retirement, and he had the second call.
Horatius and Keynote were also well
bet on. Grafter for a third of the route
cut out the running. Then Knapp urged
the favorite to the front, and, though
Ben MacDhui looked dangerous when
Martin moved with him in tne stretch,
the favorite stood a drive, passing* the
wire in front by three parts of a length;
MacDhui ran second, about the same
distance ahead of Grafter. Horatius re
ceived a severe bump at the first turn
and never showed to any advantage.

Attorney Lewis asked the court for
a continuance of two weeks in order
that his client might procure some im

the charges preferred against Lieuten
ant Frederii-k B. Neilson and Lieuten
ant Georpe S. Richards convened yes
terday morning at 10 o'clock in the li
brary at the Presidio. All the officers
were of superior rank to the defend
ants. The full court was in attend
ance, all in full-dress uniform and
jrloved in white. Promptly at the ap
pointed hour Lieutenant Colonel Wil
liam L. Pitcher called the court to
order.
It sat at a long table covered with
legal papers, with Colonel Pitcher at
one end and Captain Clarence E. Dent
ler at the other. At a Email side table
sat Lieutenant Nielson with his two at
torneys, David Lewis and Henry E.
Pillsbury.
Neilson is charged with discounting
one month's pay account to Judah Boas
<f this city and collecting salary from
the. Government for the same month.
Practically the only evidence intro
duced was the testimony of Money
lender Boas, who stated that he had
loaned money to Lieutenant Neilson
upon his pay certificate, and that Neil
ton had promised to redeem the cer
tificate in two months' time. Boas
stated that the two months' time went
by and no money was forthcoming, and
that he thon wrote to the paymaster
in Manila, who replied there must be
fome mistake in the matter. He ad
mitted, however, that the amount of
the face of the note had been paid to
him later, and that at the present mo
ir.ent he held no claims against Lieu
tenant Neilson.
When questioned by the court as to
Â¦what interest or commission the lieu-
Leouxt agreed to pay to him. Boas
was unable to state. Perhaps it was 2
P<rr cent a month, but he was not sure.
The rourt wanted to know what was
the local rate of interest he was allow

as there are no usury State laws he
<ould charge what he wanted to. He
An early snowfall was a great benefit
to the people on Dexter and other
creeks. Many who had been unable
before the snow to run their thawers
or hoists started up under favorable
conditions. At the Sugar claim the
Pioneer Company sank a shaft 233 feet
deep and ran two levels. This was
the first time that this system was
brought into use In that locality. Two
distinct pay streaks were reported to
have been uncovered by the Pioneer
Company, and a pay streak was found
where the Bowery claim* joins the Su
gar claim.
On the Dry Creek divide Duggan,
Beach & Connolly have had a force of
men working. Pay dirt, Is, reported to

The Nome News of December 25 re

were, at that date, engaged in active
operations. Mining men on Nikkala

"spotted," but they expect results in
the long run. . fc
A large amount of # work has been
performed on Hastings Creek. The ope
rators think that they have discovered
the old channel. A considerable amount
of new ground has been opened up.
Old mining locations have been taken
possession of again and assessment
work has followed.
Assessment work on the Irish Hill
properties has been pushed, the amount
not being limited to $100 to the claim.
Those who have property in this local
ity have confidence in the ground and
say they will open it up to the extent
of their means.
The Solomon River has been the
scene of much winter work. Cabins
dot the river bank3, each cabin being
a landmark of winter mining, with
promises of good results. Operations
on Peluk Creek have been pushed vig
orously and the operators have reported
that they will show better results than
they obtained last year. The installa
tion-of plants will lessen the cost pre

Miners on the Inmachuk are meet

"It was never the intention of Con
gress to establish a method of removal
All the lawyers for the defense then
took turns in hammering Heney. Mc-
Enerney asserted that he and his as
sociates had discussed the possibility
of such a course on the part of the
opposition, but had decided that the
Federal attorneys would.be above such
a snap proceeding. â¢Â¦ Knight demanded
that if the defense w : s forced to put
on their witnesses first, then the Gov
ernment, when its turn came, should
.be held down to strict rebuttal, and
not permitted to make a new case after
the defendants' witnesses had knocked
out the indictment ,
SHOT FOR GOVERNMENT.
"Objection overruled and the indict
ment admitted," said Commissioner
Heacock tersely. Then came the tug
of-war. Garret W. McEnerney of
Hyde's counsel was telling the Com
missioner that he had a long string
of objections to his ruling and he de
sired time to discuss them. Heney in
terrupted him, saying:
"Mr. McEnerney's objections will
come up right away, for the Govern
ment rests Its case on the evidence now
before the court." j
The Commissioner indicated that he
should rrefer to hear the testimony
rather than have to pass on the merits
of the case solely upon the indictment.
But Heney refused to budge.
"The statute," he declared, "makes
the indictment sufficient to establish
a case unless it is contradicted by evi
dence. It was the intention of Con
gress to provide a summary method
of. removal, and we intend to stand on
our rights as defined by the act."
The opening play in yesterday's con
test was made by Francis J. Heney,
chief counsel to the Government. "We
offer a certified copy of the indictment
in this case," was all he said.
"We object," said Attorney Bert
Schlesinger of counsel for Hyde, "on
the' ground that on its face the indict
ment shows the; Government was not
defrauded by any act of the defend
ants there alleged, and also because
the indictment fails to show that any
offense against the laws of the United
States has been committed."
The same distinguished array of at
torneys for and against the Govern
ment were in the United States Circuit
Court room yesterday as appeared on
Tuesday morning, when the case was
put over for a day. In addition to the
lawyers came the defendants, Hyde
and Dimond, while in one of the back
rows of chairs gat John A. Benson,
jointly indicted with them, who is un
der bail to appear for examination be
fore Commissioner Shields on March 29
in New York, where he was arrested.
Three of the Government's most im
portant witnesses were also present â
Woodford D. Harlan, former chief of
the forestry division of the General
Land Office; William E. Valk, chief ex
aminer in the division of contests In the
same department, and F. C. Fimple,
who is supposed to know a great deal
about the Hyde-Benson land opera
tions.
These were all the witnesses the Gov
ernment lawyers deemed it necessary
to have at hand. Even if the Commis
sioner had compelled them to" proceed
with testimony, it would take several
days to examine Harlan and Valk. This
would give the Government ample time
to bring up its small army of witnesses
from Oregon and the mountain counties;
of California. It was said yesterday
that these witnesses include men who
will testify that they received money
from Hyde and Benson or their agents
for the use of their names in land en
tries that were illegal, not being made
in good faith for their own use and oc
cupation, i
HENEY OPENS FIGHT.
The counsel for the defendants were
on their feet in an instant, fighting like
tigers. They claimed not only that they
had been, taken by surprise, but that
the fundamental rights of their clients
aÂ« American citizens were imperiled.
The indictment was but secondary evi
dence at best, they argued, and the
Government was bound to call the wit
nesses on whose testimony the Grand
Jury had acted. The only consolation,
however, that Commissioner Heacock
could give them was an adjournment
until Monday morning, when they will
have to produce their own witnesses if
they wish to traverse the prima facie
case established by the indictment.
It was a clever game and well played,
but it by no means indicates that the
Government will win out in the end.
The tactical advantage won yesterday,
important as it Is, merely relieves the
prosecution of the necessity of disclos
ing its evidence until it shall appear
whether the defendants elect to make
their first stand before the Commis
sioner or before the jury at Washing
ton. Otherwise a fortnight might be
spent in taking testimony of the lead
ing Federal witnesses, and at the end
of it all the defense might say, "We
Fhall offer no evidence here." Thus
the defendants would get possession of
the Government's case at no cost to
themselves and would then at their
leisure prepare to meet it on the trial.
Commissioner Heacock's ruling indi
cates that each side will have to show
its hand before it decides whether he
shall send Hyde and Dimond to the
Federal capital. This means a long and
bitter contest. The examination will
probably consume the better part of a
month.
SOME WITNESSES PRESENT.
"The Government rests."
Uncle Sam's attorneys made a shrewd
move yesterday morning in the fierce
legal battle they have begun before
l r nited States Commissioner E. H. Hea
cock to hold Frederick A. Hyde and
Henry P. Dimond for trial in the Su
preme Court of the District of Colum
bia. On the opening of the preliminary
examination in the land fraud case
they introduced in evidence the indjet
ment found by the Federal Grand Jury
on February i7 against Hyde, Dimond,
John A. Benson and Joost H. Schneider.
Then, like a clap- of thunder in a clear
Eky, came this announcement:
Each of the first thirty-four counts
of the indictment sets up a specific
charge of conspiracy to obtain Govern
ment lands by unlawful means. These
charges are buried in a vast deal of
legal verbiage, which is much. the same
in every count. Stripped of this, the
essence of each count is the allegation
that Hyde, Benson, Dimond and
Schneider, "by means of the false and
fraudulent practice described ia . the
â¢ The process of having the school
lands of the defendants included in
forest reserves is described as having
been carried out with the help of per
sons employed in the Interior Depart
ment's General Land Office. Harlan
and Valk. the witnesses named above,
are alleged to have been bribed to fur
nish the defendants with advance
copies of the private reports of the
forestry agents, recommending areas
for Inclusion in the reserves, thus en
abling Hyde and Benson, it. is said, to
get possession of these lands before
the public announcement of their
withdrawal was made. Benjamin F.
Allen and Grant I. Taggart, forest su
perintendent and forest supervisor, re
spectively, are charged with having
accepted money to furnish the de
fendants with all the information
gathered by them regarding desirable
areas for withdrawal and to recom
mend the withdrawal of or non-with
drawal of such areas as Hyde and
Benson might dictate. The names of
all four of these "former Government
employes appear on the indictment as
witnesses before the Grand Jury, and
it is understood that they made a
clean breast of their connection with
the 'defendants on a promise of immu
nity from prosecution.
Having got possession of the school
lands and having succeeded in getting
these lands included in the reserves,
the next step was to take out lieu
scrip entitling the holders to select
equal areas of unoccupied lands any
where else !n the United States. Thus,
it is charged, Hyde and Benson lo
cated much of the finest land remain
ing open to settlement in the West.
CHARGES IX DETAIL.
The indictment put in evidence yes
terday is one of the longest seen in a
San Francisco court in many a day.
It covers eighty-six pages and em
braces forty-two counts. The first of
these contains the most material alle
gations and is referred to in each of
the later counts. The first count sets
forth the methods by which Hyde and
Benson, with the aid of their alleged
accessories, Dimond and Schneider,
are said to have got possession ille
gally and fraudulently of hundreds of
thousands of acres of valuable West
ern lands. Only a portion of these
tracts are referred to in the indict
ment. The period covered is from
October 4, 1901, to February 1, 1904.
The gist of the indictment is that
the defendants entered into a con
spiracy to defraud the Government of
public lands â first, by illegal means,
getting possession of State school
lands in California and Oregon, which
lands they then procured to be includ
ed in forest reserves. The title to the
school lands, it is charged, was ob
tained by the employment of dum
mies, who were Induced to take up
these lands as for actual settlement,
when, in fact, they intended to trans
fer them to Hyde and Benson, or by
the use of false names and forged af
fidavits.
"One of the grievances complained
of in the declaration of independence
was that King George had a bad habit
of transporting his American subjects
across the water for trial in England.
You are following in his footsteps in
dragging our clients across the con
tinent for trial, 3000 miles away from
their homes."
"Let me correct my friend's misap
prehension," retorted Heney. "A man
Indicted in Xew York or at Washing
ton is not entitled to trial in Califor
nia or some other remote corner of
the United States. The Federal Gov
ernment has jurisdiction in every part
of the country. These men have been
indicted for acts committed in four
or five States. The offense charged is
one of which the Supreme Court of
the District of Columbia has jurisdic
tion and it must be presumed that the
indictment was found upon sufficient
evidence. The writs of the Federal
courts run in all corners of the United
States. The trouble about which my
friend complains â the removal of ac
cused persons to distant points for
trial â has existed ever since the peo
ple decided to adopt the constitution.
It is a feature of our Government."
"My suggestion a moment ago,"
Commissioner Heacock said, "was not
made because I doubted the sufficiency
of the indictment as ground for hold
ing the defendants, but because I saw
the Government's witnesses here and
believed, in view of the declarations of
the defense, that it would be neces
sary for us to go into the testimony.
The Government has a right to rest on
the indictment. Now let the defense
proceed."
The attorneys for the accused then
renewed their request for adjourn
ment and the Government making rio
objection the Commissioner granted
it. The case will be resumed at 10
o'clock Monday morning.
INDICTMENT IS LONG.
KING GEORGE'S GHOST.
that va.-uld violate the elementary prin
ciples of law and the Tights of citi
zens," was the text of a clear cut argu
ment by Charles S. Wheeler, another
of Dimond's attorneys. "The law pre
sumes innocence until guilt is proven.
You cannot destroy this' presumption
by the poorest evidence available. You
are asking his Honor to accept the
statement of a Grand Jury in prefer
ence to the testimony of the ver> wit
nesses who were before the Grana Jury,
and who are now here in this court
room. Let the best evidence be pro
duced before we are called to prove our
innocence."
But Heney was within his rights
and the able lawyers for the defense
admitted it. "We cannot control the
Government." was McEnerney's con
cession, as he asked that the Commis
sioner adjourn the hearing until Mon
day morning to enable him and his
associates to get their case in shape.
He added this little fling at his oppo
nent:
The forest reserve holdings which were !
surrendered for the lieu land scrip were
located chiefly in this State and Ore
gon, the Cascade Range reserve of the
latter and the Sierra, the San Jacinto
and the Pine Mountain and Zaca Lake
reserves of the latter being the chief
fields of operation. The lands selected
place of these parcels are scattered 'Â¦
over many States, ranging as far east
as Wisconsin and Oklahoma, but lying
chiefly in California, Oregon and Wash
ington. The several land districts in
which the 'operators located their lieu
lands and the areas of the several par
cels covered by the thirty-four counts
of the indictment are here summarized:

Total 20,791.65
This total of 20,791.65 acres, it was said
yesterday by one of the Federal repre
sentatives, covers but a small fraction
of the operations of Benson and Hyde
regarding which the Government has
evidence. These parcels were included
in the indictment, the same informant
continued, because the evidence regard
ing the transactions involving them
was deemed most conclusive.
BRIBERY IS CHARGED.
first 'count," did "unlawfully conspire,
combine, confederate and agree togeth
er, and with other persons to the grand
jurors unknown, knowingly, wickedly
and corruptly to defraud the United
States out of divers large tracts of the
public lands open and to be open to se
lection In lieu of State school lands in
cluded and to be included within the
limits of forest. reserves in the States
of California and Oregon," the title to
which lieu lands had been previously
obtained by means of the fraudulent
practices also charged in the opening
count. The location and area of the
lands selected are then given, together
with the same particulars concerning
the school lands for which they were
exchanged. The name of the person- for
whom the location was made is given,
and then each count closes wlthÂ»copies
of the letters addressed by Attorney
Dimond to the Commissioner of the
General Land Office at Washington
asking approval of the selection.
Of the thirty-four locations described
in the indictment sixteen were made in
the name of F. A. Hyde and fifteen in
that of Crawford W. Clarke, the Sacra :
mento capitalist, ,who admits that he
advanced money for Benson's opera
tions, requiring that the lands be taken
out in his (Clarke's) name in order, to
secure his loans. The" other three selec
tions were made in the names of A. S.
Baldwin, Elizabeth Dimond and Isaac
Liebes, but all the thirty-four are al
leged to have been made in the Joint
interest of Hyde and Benson. \

The Pacific Mail Company'.s steamship Sibe
ria Bailed yesterday for the Orient. Owing to
the fact that the Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner sails to-day, the Siberia's list of Honolulu
passengers was smaller than usual. For Chi
nese and Japanese ports, however, she had
many passengers. A number of Japanese, re
turning to Join the Mikado's military forces,
sailed on the Siberia, and their going away
was accompanied by the usual energetic oratory
and the tuneless music of a daring band which
fell down at "Auld Lang Syne." but tackled
without fear cr hesitation a series of what the
cheering little brown men declared to be "Ken
ulne Japanese tunes." The band escaped from
the wharf while the crowds of "not-Japanese"
were busy waving good-by to friends on the de
parting liner.
The Siberia carried about 8000 tons of cargo
which included a large shipment of canned sal
mon for Japan. Her paesengers included the
following named: , â¢ .

Lynn Austin, the genial clerk of the
Palace and for many years connected
with other fashionable hostelries of
California, has resigned his position
and will go to Santa Cruz April 1 to
accept the management of what is
commonly known as the "tented city,"
an adjunct of the seaside town re
cently created by a corporation of the
citizens of that place for the purpose
of booming new Santa Cruz.' Austin,
during his employment at the Palace
and his previous connection with the
California Hotel, ingratiated himself
into the favor of the traveling public
by his courteous treatment of guests
and his marked ability as a hotel
clerk. It was his popularity that
brought him to the attention of the
citizens of Santa Cruz when they first
conceived the idea of securing an ex
perienced manager for their new en
terprise and negotiations resulted in
the acceptance by Austin of his new
position, which carries with it a good
salary and assurance of reward in the
event of success of the big undertak
ing. His resignation has befen in the
hands of Manager John C. 'Kirkpat
rick of the Palace for several days,
but will not be effective until the clos
ing days of the month, by which time
hJs successor behind the hotel desk
will have been selected. *

A Cargo for Honolulu.
Although so badly Scarred . the
Queen sustained no vital damage.
After the fire was extinguished she
weathered a full gale and in spite of
storm and fire landed all but sixty
tons of her cargo in good condition.
She brought a cargo from Seattle to
this port. After discharging it she will
go to the Union Iron "Works to be re
paired.
"The newspapers told the story exact
ly as it happened." he said yesterday,
"but they gave me too much of the
credit. Every man, woman and child
aboard that boat contributed ma
terially to the happy result of our ef
forts. Had the women and children
not been game, had they "become
panic-stricken, we would have had to
detail more men to look after them.
Had we had a man less we could not
have mastered the flames. If the en
gineer and his crew had not stayed at
their posts and kept up the steam to
operate the pumps, all the efforts of
the deck force would have been futile;
,It was a case of everybody doing his
beat and each is entitled to an equal
share of the- credit for saving the
ship."
The Queen's dining saloon is gutted
to the -iron skin of the hull. Aft of the
saloon little woodwork is left and the
gnarled tangle of the iron beams and
frames bears dramatic testimony to
the intensity of the heat. The Queen's
stern looks like a Japanese description
of the condition of the Russian navy,
only more so.
The steamship Queen, .which on the
morning of February 27 so narrowly
escaped destruction by fire at sea, ar
rived here yesterday from Seattle. She
has come to her home port to be re
paired, and, judging by her flame
scarred hull, the jot> will be a big one.
Captain Cousins, whose conduct in the
time of grave danger was no surprise
to those acquainted with his worth as
a man and as a seaman, speaks mod
estly of his share in that gallant fight
agrainst an enemy that seemed in
vincible.

Rennle, Chief Engineer A. B. Brolly and Third
Officer J. R. Clarkaon have all resigned their
positions, which will he filled by a general
moving- up of those now below them In their
respective departments. It is understood that
the three officers who have resigned will be
appointed to the big liner Mongolia, which, in
command of Captain Rlnder, formerly of the
Coptic, is now thirty-three days out from
Norfolk for this Port and which takes her
place on the trans-Pacific run May 7..

Messrs. Harrold, Foley and Galla
gher were appointed a committee to
wait on the Mayor to ask him to de
clare the day of launching a holiday in
this city.
It was decided to have each parlor
send to the executive committee the
number of members who will want to
go on the boats..
The secretary was instructed to
notify all parlors in the State to send
representatives to the launching.
It is probable that the eldest daugh- j
ter of Governor Pardee will christen
the vessel.
} Members of the order bearing a spe- j
cial badge will be admitted to the \
Union Iron Works to' witness the
launching:.
April 28, the date set for the launch- j
ing, comes within the time that the j
Grand Parlor will be in session in Val- !
lejo, and it was suggested that the i
Grand Parlor be asked to transact its |
business in three days and on the !
fourth day take part in the launching I
ceremonies. '
T. P. Martin reported that Mr. Scott j
of the Union Iron Works had agreed I
to have 5000 invitations printed, the j
same to have upon them what the com
mittee desires. He stated further that
two boats have been secured and that
a third one-whl be engaged. I
The parlors of San Jose were per
mitted to have representatives on the
general committee.
The executive committee, through R.
D. IJarton, the secretary, said that it
had been decided to procure 5000 sou
venir badges, to secure the Woodward
Pavilion for literary exercises during
the evening of the launching, also to
have two bands at the launching.
The committee of the Native Sons of
the Golden West that is to have
charge ,of the ceremonies attending:
the launching of the cruiser Caltfornia
held a meeting: in Native Sons' Hall
last night. M. H. Squires of South San
Francisco Parlor presided.
A request from the cruiser commit
tee of the Native Daughters, that they
be permitted to present to the cruiser a
seal of the State, of California, was
granted.

The local millers are quoting a very weak
market for Bran, Middlings, etc., owing to the
rapidiy Increasing ereen feed. Hay is also
easy, though, as there is not more than enough
to ca'ry the market through to the new crop,
there is no pressure to sell on the part of
holders.
The Hay circular of Somers & Co. says:
"There has been a decided lessening In re
ceipts of Hay for the week ending to-day, for
the total shows bat 2100 tons in comparison
with 2500 tons for last wesk and 2600 tons for
the week precedinc that. Continued stormy
wenthT has Interfered with the market right
along, although yeeterday, which was clear,
ihowej a rather gtronu and fairly active mar
kei in spite of the heaviest arrivals for several
weeks pat>t. As we have reported before many
consumers have been buying from hand to
mouth, expecting much lower prices because of
the bountiful rains. They are beginning to
realise now that they will find no relief in' this
connection until the new crop is ready for
market, and many of them are now prepared
to buy in their regular manner. The foreign
Inquiry continues, but thus far no orders of
any consequence nave been placed In this mar
ket. The United Suites Government baa Just
purchased a nmail order of Hay for immediate
shipment, but will not open bids for the new
25Â»>0-ton order until the 15th Of April. In all
probability this Utter order will be placed in
this market, and, with our already depleted
stocks ct Hay. there is no reason why the pres
ent range of prices should not be maintained
until the new crop begins to be marketed in
good quantities. .â

The cold, sharp weather following so closely

murkci and traae throughout the day was 01 a
light Jobbing character.. Receipts were mod

to reduce thtlr stocks. The steamer Sonoma,
sailing to-Jay, will take out several larg* ship

in the auction rooms was qu'.et, the bulk of
the oirennss being bought back by the man

hauling off of the steam schooners are keeping
back shipments from the country.

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. March 2T. â Brilliant vernal
weather caused during the greater part of the
day a general liipp^sition to sell wheat. The
tendency was emphasized by lower Liverpool
rabies, although the weakness abroad was due
largely to bearish American advices. Commis
sion hcuses and pH traders were alike eager
sellers. Buyers were hard to find. In conse
quence the market gradually became weak?r.
The execution of a. number of stop-loss orders
was a fresh clement of weakness. Minneapo
lis reported four flour mills closed. Further
more receipts frcm the Northwest showed an
increase. Suddenly a*, the last hour a radical
charge became apparent. In a rush to protect
themselves the shorts force-1 prices up rapidly.
Reports from Indiana claiming much damage
by drouth in that State were mainly responsi
ble for the late buying. July closed with a
lofs of Sift^c at K5 7 *c. May closed with a
net less of '4c at 02c.
Liquidation of the May delivery caused weak
ness in corn during the first part of the session.
The close was stronjr. with May a shade lower
at 52 cent?. July closed at 49-%$M9Â»4e.
Oats suffered during the early part of the
session from the weakening Influence of other
grains. July closed at 37%c. May clcsed
lower at 39 Se.
In spite of decreased receipts of hogs and
higher prices at the yards, there was general
selling of provisions. Commission houses were
the principal sellers an<! the buying waa largely
by packers. Eariy weakness in grains was the
main cause of the Belling pressure. A better
demand developed late In the day and some re
covery was made. The close was steady, with
May pork 12^Â»c lower at |12 92',i; May lard
was off 7Vic and ribs were 2^Q5c lower.

CANDY GIRLS TESTIFY.
The cross - examination tardily ;
brought out the fact that the arsenic !
purchased from Grey was powdered |
and not in lump form, which is an.im
portant point, inasmuch as all the tes
timony so far Introduced by the prose
cution is to the effect that the poison
in. the candy was lump arsenic.
Professor Thomas Price, the well
known local chemist, who has been en
gaged in the profession for forty-two
years in this city, was next. called. He
had taken seven pieces of the candy
from the* box presented to him by Chief
of Police Lees and Detective McVey,
together with some powdered residue
at the bottom of the box. When asked
the results of his analyses Knight in
terposed an objection on the ground
that /it had not been sufficiently shown
by the "prosecution that the box from
which Professor Price had taken the
candy was the same as that received
by. MrsJ Dunning in Dover. Judge Cook
reserved his decision until he could
have an opportunity of having some of
the testimony read to him and 'could
examine authorities. He had not reach
ed a determination at the time of ad
journment yesterday afternoon. The
witness was withdrawn temporarily
pending the ruling. . . .'
state positively that the defendant was
the purchaser of the poison.
"I am not absolutely certain," was
tho answer, "but it was she to the best
of my knowledge and belief."
Owing to the Importance of the po
sition action willnot be taken by the
Board of Education until next May or
June. Mayor Schmitz will be a large
factor in the selection of the man, as
School Directors Roncovleri, "Walsh and
Boyle would no doubt be guided therein
by the one to whom they owe their own
political advancement.
Among other candidates for the prin
cipalship are Charles H. Ham. head
of English and history in the Poly
technic High School; J: J. Gallagher,
head of classics in the Lowell High
School: Principal Scott of. the Alameda
High School; W. N. Bush, principal of
the Polytechnic High School; Albert
M.. Armstrong, head of classics in "the
Mission High School. In all likelihood
the crop of candidates will be largely
Increased before the appointment is
made.

candidates for the, place and believes
himself well qualified for It from an
executive point of view. Mark is of
the opinion that his colleagues will
vote fur him, but he has. a strong com

DOVER, Del., March 23^â County
officials are alarmed over the. mysteri
ous disappearance of the death certifi
cate of Mrs. John . P. Dunning, for
whose. murder Mrs. Cordelia Botkin is
now; being tried in California. Addi
tional search; made; to-day; disclosed
the fact 'that the 'certificate of Mrs.
Joshua b.^Deane's death, a 'sister of
Mrs. Dunning, who was also. killed^ by
the poisoned candy,- was "missing" from
the county archives." "The disappear
ance of the certificate, of -Mrs. Deane
has baffled the corps of. lawyers who
have been .searching â¢' the for
the two /certificates. ..The^ certificate, it
is alleged, would refute -the^testimony
bf.Coroner W. J. .Walls/who is said to
be a. star. witness for- Mrs. Botkin.
The disappearance of .the death cer

David B. Green, who was employed
in 1898 p.s pharmacist at the Star 1
drujj store, 1002" Market street, was
the last witness of the day._ He testi
fied that on June 1 -of that' year he
sold to aWoman^two' ounces of lump
arsenic and that Mrs/ Botkin .re
sembled generally â¢ in jj appearance
the- one who- had.' purchased
the poison. He explained that he
sold her lump .arsenic because that
was the only kind in stock, although
as ' a general rule pulverized arsenic
was the form of the poison retailed.
An objection was irtade'tO'his detail-
Ing the conversation 'between him and
his ' customer and Judge Cook ruled
that it would be improper.
District A ttorney, .\ Byington stated
that ihe examina,tion.:Of the. next wit

it was after ,4 o'clock, an adjournment

large stock of general knowledge, de
rived no benefit from the long cross

S. Grey when he sold a woman an
swering Mrs. Botkin's description two
ounces of arsenic on the same date.
Bernard J. McVey, who at the time" of
the murder of Mrs. Dunning and Mrs.
Deane was State Detective of Delaware
and who Â¦ brought from Dover to San
FrancisCo the remaining pieces of poi
soned . candy, together with the box,
wrapper, note and handkerchief con
tained in the box. was the first witness
of the day, having been recalled by the
prosecution. - He made a positive identi
fication of the candy, stating that five
years ago he was . perfectly familiar
with every piece in the box. Between
that time and this, he said, the candy
had shrunk some, but its . geneVal ap
pearance'was so' far .unSkUered as to al
low him to state positively that it was
the same he had turned over to Chief
of Police Lees In this city.
KNIGHT ATTACKS LEES.
"Don't you know of your own knowl
edge,", roared Knight, "that Chief of
Police Lees bought candy from Haas &
Son and doped it with arsenic for the
purpose of convicting this defendant?"
"I do not," was the quiet answer.
"Is it not a fact." continued Knight,
still in thunder, tones, "that you- and
Lees stuffed candy, with arsenic and
turned some of it over to Chemist
Price in a conspiracy . . to hang the
charge of murder on Mrs. Botkin?"
"It is not," McVey- answered.
When Knight had ''finished Byington
had a question or two.
"Did Chief of Police Lees ever inform
you that he had. intercepted Dr. Bishop
when he was on hte way from Dover to
Newark, Delaware, with the poisoned
candy in his^possession, had taken the
candy away from * him and stuffed- it
full of .arsenic?" â¢-'."". ' :
"No, 'sir,-" said .the witness. ;/ , ,
"Did Chief of Police Lees ever tell
you that he journeyed to 'Newark 'and
Induced Dr. Wolfe, the State chemist,
the day after, the funeral of Mrs.-Dun
ning and Mrs.. Deane, to make a report
that the candy' in question contained
large quantities of arsenic?".
"He "did not," said. McVey.
Knight was on his feet again, roaring
like a lion." - " ;'Â¦
"Did 'you ever hear that Dr. Bishop
paid, /My. God, -I'm -up' against it! X've
poisoned â¢ tjvo 'women, and " I' must pre
pare some kind of a % defense'?" '
"No,. sir," said the w'itness.,
"Dld- you '.ever hear 'that. Dr. Bishop
did riot ' know' . the | dj ff orence between

from his seat. Mrs. Botkin stood side
