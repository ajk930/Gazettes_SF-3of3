Leon Claranario this afternoon made
a full confession to Constable John
Kett and others in which he states that
he committed the murder of Aruju,
alone and unassisted. Mrs. Aruju was
present at the time they quarreled and
she afterward assisted him in disposing
of the body. The fugitive tells the full
story of his flight from Tehachapi to
Cameron on Wednesday after the crime
was committed, from there to Mojave,
where he remained three days. He was
unable to get work and went from there
to Los Angeles, concealed himself there
for a while and then went to San
Diego, where he was arrested.

April 17 was a public holiday in
celebration of the raising of the flag
in 1900. Athletic sports were held
during the day. A national salute was
fired by the man of war at midday and
the native brass band played at inter
vals during the sports.
TUTUILA. May 3.â Regret was ex
pressed here when ths news was re
ceived that the U. S. S. Adams was
ordered to relieve the U. S. S. Wheel
ing as the station ship in Tutuila and
that consequently there would be a
change of officers who have been con
nected with the island Government.
Captain Underwood, the commandant,
has made himself very popular. He
ha? established a Samoan newspaper
and a native school. Assistant Pay
master Goodhue. U. S. X.. has held the
position of island treasurer for nearly
three years, and Ensign Lackey, U. S.
N., has been chief custom officer for
the last six months.

Finally, however, a telegram bearing
the signature of no less a personage
than Thomas McCaffery, an official of
the Southern Pacific, with headquar
ters at Los Angeles, and a prominent
politician, was in the hands of Samuel
Schiller, a leader of the delegation
from San Diego. This telegram in pos
itive tones demanded that the San
Diego delegation vote solidly in the in
terests of Hearst and his candidate for
chairman. This left no doubt as to the
power that was behind the author of
the telegram. That it had its full Â°f

tions of "those that have* watched the

entire convention to dateâ and it has
been a convention replete with sur
prisesâcame to-day when the hand of
the Southern Pacific Company loomed
up in the fight in favor of Hearst, who
has poured the vials of his wrath upon
the heads of the directors of this cor
poration in the past.
When San Diego County cast its
votp solid, for the pro-instructionists'
programme, a murmur of surprise
swept through the convention and
gave the first' hint that some Influence
had been operating to swerve what
was believed to be this delegation's
fealty to the Gould candidacy for
the chairmanship from its intended
course. The shrewd politicians that
have been handling the fight to down
the programme for instruction forth
with began to make an investigation.
The conditions that had brought about
this change in the , San Diegans was
hard to uncover. ' â¢
And this may also account for the
number of passes upon which delegates
from the southern part of the State
enjoyed the journey to the convention
city and upon which they will return
to their homes to explain to those that
sent them here why It was that they
bolted the anti-instruction forces in a
body. . .
The feeling is so intense over the
contest that Is inevitable to-morrow
when an effort will be made by the
Hearst forces to put through an In
struction resolution that the great ma
jority of the delegates who stood. loyally
by Gould to-day in his fight for chair
man will call upon Gavin McNab and
demand that he do not recede one iota
from the position he. has taken. They
fear that in the interests of harmony
McNab will yield too much to the oppo
sition. They have been loyal to him In
his fight, fhey say, and now they in
sist that he lead them through until
the last gun is fired, even though it
split the party wide open on the ques
tion of the virtues of Hearst.

FORECAST OF DELEGATES TO NATIONAL SESSION
Bishop Grant, chairman of the Gen
eral Conference Commission, presided
and introduced the speaker. The peo
ple gave the Governor an ovation when
he arose to deliver his address. He
said in part:
"It is, in my opinion, high time for
the colored people of this country to
cease looking upon themselves as a
problem. Such conception of the race
problem is simply a sum of problems
confronting every black man, as they
do every white man, and which every
man must solve for himself.
"Brooding over wrongs, however real;
revolting against conditions, however
harsh: crying out against discrimina
tion, however apparent â this in itself
will not accomplish anything for the
colored people of the country. If there
is a race question In this country, there
is just one way in which each indi
vidual colored man may contribute to
its certain solution, and that is by re
solving that he shall fight bravely on
ward toward a higher ideal of living
and thinking."
CHICAGO, May 16.â Quinn Chapel
was thrown Into a panic to-night dur
ing an address by Governor Durbin of
Indiana, when a crank rushed down
the middle aisle with his hand extended
threateningly toward the Governor and
exclaiming, "I will kill any man who
disputes the word of Father Abraham."
The venerable bishops of church, min
isters and laymen rushed upon the man
before he could reach the platform.
Others placed themselves as guards be
tween Indiana's executive and the
struggling lunatic.
Fifteen hundred people in attendance
at the quadrennial conference were ter
ror-stricken when they saw the man
running toward the Governor. He
waited quietly until order had been
restored and then proceeded with his
speech.
The man was ejected from the build
ing. It is believed he is insane. No
one knew him. The crank's appearance
was first noted when he cried out: "I
will kill any one who disputes the word
of Abraham, the father of our nation.
I am in the world to see that it is not
done." 'Â¦} ;~ â¢Â¦â¢"
ing that they -will throw a larger vote
for instruction to-morrow than they
cast for Jeter to-day and hints are
made that accessions of strength will
come from the San Francisco delega
tion. All indications point to a spirit

of the anti-Hearst delegates are mind
ed to sneak their sentiments in a di
rect manner.

Ycnng Chief of the Department of
Commerce and Labor Is to Work
The point discussed to-night is wheth
er McNab can hold an equal number
of men in line to-morrow when Tarpey
advances the resolution to instruct for
Hearst. Rumors are flying thick and
fast to the effect that Tarpey's follow
ing \vill be increased by the arrival of
delegates who were absent to-day.
Ugly hints are thrown out that Colonel
Mazuma has arrived with timely rein
forcements. Leading Democrats, who
hold that a great victory for true par
ty principles was more in the election
of Frank H. Gould, express apprehen
sion as to the outcome of to-morrow's
combat.
The oratory in the convention to-day
was several degrees below the grade of
brilliancy. Judge Raker of Modoc eas
ily carried off the honors In the nom
inating line. Many of the delegates
expected to hear from Ed Lcake of
Yolo. Thomas Geary of Sonoma, Frank
lin K. Lane and James H. Barry of
San Francisco, Isadore B. Dockweiler of
Los Angeles and E. C. Farnsworth of
Visalia. Leake of Yolo would have
gone to the front in the style that made
him conspicuous as an anti-Hearst man
at the meeting of the Democratic State
Central Committee, but his voice is so
impaired that He can scarcely speak
above a whisper.
The leaders of the Hearst forces ac
count for their defeat in to-day's en
gagement bv unexpected desertions in
the Los Angeles and Alameda delega
tions.
To-nlffht tbo Hearst men are claim-.
Tarpey openly avows his purpose to
present the resolution to instruct for
Hearst. He will not accept the com
promise of a Hearst delegation unin
structed. There Is much more at
stake than the simple adopting of a
resolution to govern the course of the
California delegation to the Demo
cracic National Convention. McNab
Is placed In a position where he is
bound to fight In order to maintain his
leadership of the Democratic party of
the State.
Regarding the election of Gould on
the alignment accepted by both fac
tions as an indorsement of the record
and purposes of the organization,
McNab's management of the San
Francisco division enlisted the admir
ation of the interior delegates. For
style in the art of high bossing the re
sourceful Gavin gave his fellow Dem
ocrats an object lesson. His person
ality was not in any sense concealed.
He was on the floor of the convention
among the delegates of the several As
sembly districts of the metropolis and
surely made good his pledge to the
inland supporters of non-instruction
that he would hold San Francisco in
line. Only eight of the 168 of the city
contingent fell down and the deser
tions were ascribed to booze rather
than boodle.
PROPHETS ARE BUSY.
SANTA CRUZ, May 18.â The day's
battle Is over and the Hearst band
wagon is In use as an ambulance to
carry off the wounded. In what
seemed to be an open, fair contest on
the question at issue, the forces op
posed to instruction for Hearst won
the victory, bot Tarpey propose*; t >' re
new the engagement to-morrow and
force the adoption of a resolution to
instruct. .
Gavin McXab is not boasting of the
triumph achieved in the election of
Frank H. Gould to the chairmanship
of the convention, and is not inclined
to underestimate the strength of Tar
pey in the next conflict. Tarpey to
day was astounded when the strength
of the McNab column was disclosed
and its discipline put to the test. Mc-
Nab was also surprised at the vitality
and strength of the Hearst following,
hence both sides are reorganizing for
another struggle.
STRIFE WAXES BITTER.
SANTA BARBARA. May 15.â A sÂ«rl
ous automobile accident. In which sev
eral prominent Los Angeles people
: were badly injured, occurred on the
San Marcos Pass, a mountain grade on
which motor cars are,, not allowed.
News of the catastrophe reached Santa
Barbara this afternoon and created no
little excitement here.
Owing to & broken brake a heavy
machine, owned by Andrew Jung of
Los Angeles and carrying Jung, his
wife and Charles Miller, his chauffeur.
, dashed down the steepest part of the
grade and turned turtle, dangerously
injuring Mrs. Jung and pinning Jung
under the car. Miller escaped without
serious hurt.
The Jung party in one car, Mr. and
Mrs. Tom Viges in another and Frank
Hu/Json and wife in a third, were tour-
Ing from Los Angeles to Niles. Al
though it is against tfcs law for motors
to cross the San Marcos Pass on ac
count of the danger to traffic, the three
machines took this route and Hudson
and Viges made the descent in safety
and waited at the foot of the grade for
Jung. His failure to arrive caused ths
others great alarm and they were
about to return when Miller ran up and
dropped in a faint before he could ex
plain what had happened.
After reviving. Miller stated that
shortly after leaving the Cold Springs
Hotel the brake broke and the machine
dashed down the grade at a terrtflc
pace. After making several perilous
turns Miller ran the car into the bank,
where It turned completely over. Mrs.
Jung was thrown to the ground with
frightful force, sustaining a deep scalp
wound and a cut in the cheek, Jung
being pinned under the machine.
When the rescue party arrived on
the scene Mrs. Jung was still uncon
scious. At the sight of the wreck Mil
ler fainted again and it was some time
before he revived. After great trouble
Jung was taken out and the entire par
ty was conveyed to Kelley's bee ranch,
a short distance away.

SANTA CRUZ, May 16. â The die has been cast and Hearst has lost at least the moral support of the Democracy of California. A majority of the delegates to the Democratic convention here in session â a majority sufficient
ly large to leave no question as to the temper of the greater number of Democrats of California â voted to place in the chair to lead them in further deliberations Frank H. Gould of San Francisco. Mr. Gould was the opponent of former
Lieutenant Governor William T. Jeter, a resident of this city, who was selected by M. F. Tarpey and other directors of the Hearst forces to lead them in the fight for a delegation to the national convention instructed to vote first and last
for Hearst, a candidate for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. "The issue was a plain one, and with the defeat of Jeter came the defeat in California of the aspirations of Hearst. Another point in the selec
tion of Gould is settled beyond a dispute. It established beyond question the domination in California, so far as the Democracy is concerned, of the McNab-Lane organization. The work of to-day's sessions practically ended with the elec
tion of Gould. Committees were appointed, and they labored until late in the night.

The San Francisco CallWASHINGTON, May 16.â The Japa
nese legation has received the following
cablegram from Tokio:
"Admiral Kataoka reports that on
May 14 our torpedo-boat flotilla con
tinued sea-sweeping operations under
cover of the fleet. The enemy con
structed temporary batteries on the
promontory at Kerr Bay, Talienwan,
mounting six field guns, besides a hast
ily constructed fort, and with one com
pany of soldiers stubbornly resisted our
attack. Our torpedo flotilla, defying the
enemy's fire, carried out the operations
and destroyed five mines laid by the
enemy. Unfortunately, one* of the mines
exploded and sunk our cruiser Miyako.
In this accident six men were killed,
besides the two who were wounded in
the fight."
The news of the loss of the Miyako
has been sorrowfully received in Tokio.
The dangerous character of the work
in which the Miyako was engaged Is
generally appreciated, but it was
thought that the loss of torpedo-boat
No. 48, under, similar circumstances
Thursday last, would serve as a warn
ing to those engaged In the work to ex
ercise the greatest care. .
Admiral Kataoka reports that the
Russians withdrew Robinson
Point, northeast of Kerr Bay, which
adjoins Talienwan Bay, May 12, but
they erected a temporary fort on a
height northeast of Taku Mountain,
where they mounted six guns and con
structed protecting trenches. The ves
sels of Admiral Kataoka's squadron
shelled the Russians throughout Sun
day, but the latter stubbornly retained
their position. i
The Japanese flotillas while sweeping
the bay were exposed to- the Russian
fire all day, but continued their work
uninjured.

operation of removing the mines in
Kerr Bay was continued by the tor

bardment by the fleet. There is no
change in the enemy's defense, except
the addition of two or three field guns
to their position, which had the effect

CZAR VISITS MOSCOW.
Greeted on His Journey Enthusiasti
cally Tjy Soldiers and Civilians.
MOSCOW, May 16.â In the ancient
capital of the empire Emperor Nicholas
to-day received an enthusiastic wel
come. His stay was brief, lasting only
thirty-five minutes, because of his wish
to hasten to Kharkoff to begin bidding
farewell to the troops under orders for
the Far- East, but it was sufficient to
enable all classes of the public to show
their loyalty to the throne in this trying
time of war.
His Majesty's trip to Moscow was de
void of incident and was uninteresting
perhaps to himself and to the members
of his staff, but to a stranger in the
empire It was filled with picturesque
color. At every hundred yards along
the line there was stationed a soldier in^
the regulation uniform, who brought.
his gun to the salute as soon as the lo
comotive of the imperial train reached
him. Thus the royal party swept along
for hundreds of miles past saluting sen
tries.
The first intimation the imperial par
ty had that the Moscow stage of the
Journey was nearing an end was at
Klin, where the railroad enters Moscow.
Governor Christ of Moscow and the lo
cal authorities were waiting on the
platform and as soon as the train
stopped the Governor proceeded to the
car occupied by the emperor and wel
comed him to the province The train
then continued on to Moscow, where
preparations had been in progress for
several days for the imperial visitor.
Among those assembled at the station
at Moscow were Grand Duke Sergius,
Governor General of Moscow, accom
panied by Grand Duchess Elizabeth:
the son of Grand Duke Paul, Grand
Duke Dimitri, a young boy, and his sis
ter. Grand Duchess Marie.
The vast kalancheff square, just out
side the station, was packed by thou
sands of standing persons, who had
hopes of getting a glimpse of their sov

m.âThe Japanese evidently are deter
rr.ired that there shall not be any fur

ficial advices received to-day by the
general staff say the Japanese have
destroyed fifty miles of the railroad
north of Kinchou. No. resistance was

ally* abandoning iu On the Japanese
epproach Â¦ Colonel Spirdorof of the
Amur Railroad Battalion is seeking to
render the railroad as useless as pos
sible by removing the switches and
otherwise disabling the road. Th?
Russians are retiring because of the
approach of the Japanese column sent
westward by General Kuroki immedi
ately after the occupation of Feng
vangcheng.
Experts who discussed the military
situation to-day expressed the opinion
that General Kuropatkin will not re
main at Liaoyang. Their view seems
. to be borne out by reports from Liao
yang announcing the departure of Rup
eian families from that point. It is
said rhat General Kuropatkin is not at
a!l discouraged by the advance of the
Japanese. Telegrams received here to
day from Liaoyang report him as be
5r.g "perfectly satisfied" with the out
look.
It was announced to-day* that the
Tenth and Seventeenth army corps
will leave May IS for Manchuria. This
force includes the Orenburg division
of Cossacks and artillery armed with

It appears that Captain William B.

Admiralty Believes That Launch With
Tori>edo Crippled Japanese
Cruiser.
ST. PETERSBURG, May ,17, 2:20
a. m. â Owing to the interruption of
communication with Port Arthur, the
Admiralty has no information of the
blowing up of the Japanese cruiser
Miyako on May 15 or the torpedoing
and crippling of an armored Japanese
cruiser in Taliemvan Bay May 10 by a
launch in command of a young Russian
naval officer. The Admiralty officers
read with interest the account of the
former and point out that' by no
chance could the two happenings be
Identical, since the Miyako was struck
ln daylight and the other event is re
ported as happening at night.
The Admiralty, while awaiting news
of either incident, points out the fea
sibility of the launch exploit, since the
equipment for sending torpedoes from
small boats is an invention of the late
Vice Admiral Makaroff, which he
utilized in the Russo-Turkish war.
Where one or two Japanese ships
have been crippled, satisfaction is ex
pressed by the Admiralty that/There
has been some equivalent for the dis
asters to the Port Arthur fleet. â¢
Vice Admiral Rojestvnsky Â¦ of the
Baltic fleet said that there would be no
hurry for the voyage to the Far East
and that he does not expect now to
arrive in the Pacific until September
1 next at the earliest.
A resolution was adopted declaring
that the war was not connected with
racial or religious questions, but was
being carried on to insure the security
of the empire of \Japan and permanent
peace in the East It was further as
serted that this was distinctly in the
Interest of Justice and the civilization
of the world.

CHINA 15 XEUTRAIj.
Officials Declare That Government
Has Maintained a Strictly Proper
Attitude.
ST. PETERSBURG, May 16, 2 p. m.â
In order, to allay Russian apprehension
as to the attitude of China, the Chinese
Minister here has given Foreign Min
ister Lamsdorff fresh assurances of the
purpose of his Government not to vio
late its neutrality and to preserve
tranquility throughout the empire.
These assurances, which are based on
dispatches received from the Chinese
Foreign Office and Viceroy -Yuan Shi
Kai. commander in chief of the Chinese
forces, set forth in the most positive
terms that there is absolutely no
ground to believe that China will de
part from her proclaimed -attitude.
"While there has not been the slight
est fear that the peace of the empire
will be disturbed or that my Govern
ment would intervene in the war/*, said
the- Chinese Minister to the correspond
ent of the Associated Press, "it was
Etill deemed wise to communicate â¢ to
Peking and Viceroy Yuan Shi Kai the
sensational rumors circulating- in Eu
rope." ..:;:.
The Chinese Foreign Offlce telegraph
ically reiterated that China -is deter
mined to continue to- observe the strict
est neutrality, giving' < its support
neither to Russia nor toMapan. â¢
"Viceroy Yuan Shi Kai telegraphed
that the rumors of impending uprisings
were without foundation- and assured
me that. a repetition of the Boxer re
volt of 1900 was impossible." 'Â¦Â¦
The Minister was not advised of the
attack of the Governor of "Cheefow on
the coal mines at Port Adams. He
thinks the circumstances are most
misunderstood and that it will be
found that there was no intention to
commit an act of hostility against Rus
sia. Neither was the Minister Inform
ed of the reported Chinese attacks on
Russian troops in Manchuria,.' \ for
which, even if they occurred, China
could, not be .held responsible, as the
region is comprised in the theater of
war, which is specifically exempted
from Chinese Jurisdiction.
Heavy Battle Is Imminent.
WASHINGTON, May 16.â An inti
mation has reached the officials here
to the effect that, a great battle is im
minent in the vicinity of the Liaoyang,

make a stand. 'The rumor* cannot be
traced to its source. .
Transports Sighted and
Troops Supposed to
Be Landed.
The military occupation of Chinnampo
is' mostly in the European concession,
which lies on the right bank of the
Taidong River. Back of the conces
sion lies a considerable Korean village.
Swarms of ugly Koreans were hanging
about the narrow, dirty streets all day,
their principal interest seeming to cen
ter ln the various devices for gambling,
of which there were scores. . Most of
these were on the plan of the Chinese
game of dice from which the American
game . of chuck-luck was taken. An
other favorite Korean" game is more
utilitarian. Above a tray of little cakes
swings a small arrow, ; pivoted * in the
middle.- The "/ hungry gambler puts
down his coin and gives the * arrow a
spin. If it stops over a pile of cakes
be grabs, them and begins his meal. on
the spotl M If *it misses, aa'mdBt . of ten
This afternoon gangs of coolies were
busily piling up the boxes of Red Cross
supplies that formed a large part of the
cargo of the Suminoye Maru. A bat
tery of howitzers with their caissons
stands next to a line of pontoons and
between them sentries stand guard
over a great heap of ammunition.
Farther in there are some batteries of
field artillery, each carefully guarded,
with warning signs scattered about for T
bidding any one to touch the guns.
Still farther in there is an artillery
park, where all sorts of artillery sup
plies are stored.
All about the place lie heaps of huge
timbers ready to be worked up into
the . Bizea needed, and swarms of
Korean sawmen are busy_ at each pile,
slowly cutting the timbers into boards.
The method Is as primitive as it is
tedious. One end of a timber is raised
over a sawhorse to a height of several
feet. Two men work each saw. One
stands on top of the timber and the
other. sits on the ground underneath.
One stroke to the * half-minute, or
thereabouts, they draw the heavy saw
back and forth between them. When
the cut reaches the sawhorse the saw
is taken out and a new cut begun. A
piece of rope tied around the timber
keeps the board ends fastened together,
and when one end has been sawd up
the timber is reversed and the other
end cut. . By this means about one'and
a half timbers are cut into boards in a
day. . N
'M GAMBLING THE SPORT.
The seawall flanks a broad road well
built ud above the surrounding coun
try. Along this road a track has been
laid on which small cars may be run
by. hand to assist in getting stores and
supplies up from the beach. Where the
pier leads down to the water a hill
rises sharply from the beach, so that
there is only a narr*ow roadway, but a
little farther on the road opens on a
broad flat stretch aqd^ there the first
of many storehouses have been erected.
It has been the work of but a few days
to put up these storehouses, and al
ready some of them are well filled.
They are roughly constructed of thin
board sides, but roofed with corrugated
iron. , Along the roadway from the
landing are scattered piles of different
kinds of stores.
All the men immediately signified
their intention of traveling by " the
transport, and a small ship was char
tered by the canteen contractor to take
the Interpreters and baggage alflng.
We were instructed to take the Gov
ernment ship at Moji, and there we
went from Kobe In the little Nagata
Maru that does seven knots when wind,
tide and everything else favor and ties
up in some safe shelter when anything
goes the least. bit wrong.
At Moji the transport people prompt
ly told us that they expected to take
interpreters and all on the Suminoye
Maru. This decided change of attitude
was the first real indication that we
were getting^ forward and was an omen
that the beaurocratic tight rein that
had been held on us so long ln Tokio
would be eased off as as we reached
the scene of practical activities.
This was a good omen and to-day's
experience has borne It out. To be!
sure there has not been such a great
lot to see to-day that they will let
one describe. The town lies for the
most part in a little cleft between
steep hills covered with scrub pine.
It was low tide when our ship dropped
anchor and along th^shores stretched
broad flats of mud that ended in a
stout stone seawall. Along the wall
lay'dozens of sampans, nearly all new,
each numbered and marked to show
its capacity ln men or horses. Half a
dozen transports lay at anchor In the
river, and beyond them a small gun
boat. A pier made of large flat stones
laid on th-> mud leads down from the
seawall to the water, so that at low tide
the sampans may come In and dis
charge their cargo.
FILLING THE STOREHOUSES.
CHINNAMPO, Korea, Sunday, April
10, 1904â This begins to look as if we
were really getting toward the front.
I had begun , to suspect that there was
no such place in fact, but that Itv was
only a myth," but this' morning when
the Suminoye.Maru dropped her anchor
in the river here and I saw the hills that
fringe the place dotted with the camps
of soldiers and the valleys between
them filled with new warehouses I be-,
gan to think that there might be ' a
front after Â¦ all, and that we were, on
the track of it. , Then when we got
ashore and the polite officer at head
quarters said we were at liberty to.^go
on as soon as our baggage got up it
seemed" quite convincing, for surely ' If
there were no place to which to go
how could we go to it?
We had been since Wednesday, the
6th, getting up from Mojl., There an
unexpected and pleasant surprise was
given to us. AH '^inquiries In Tokio
had elicited the same reply, which was
that when the men who were assigned
to the first army were finally permit.
ted to go- forward they would have to
find their own tranaporatlon to the
place of debarkation. The Government
offered, indeed, to take the men them
selves on a Government transport, but
without their interpreters and on'con
dition that they supply their own food
for the voyage.
TRAVEL OX TRANSPORT.
this morr.ins comment on what is be
lieved to W the precarious position cf
General Kuiopatkin, who is menaced
by the possibility, of the Chinese rebels
cutting his communications, as well as
by the difficulty of divining the Japa
nese plan of campaign.
The Standard, which is rather in
clined to be pro-Russian in its views,
admits that Kuropatkin has at his dis
posal almost 300,000 troops of inferior
quality, only 7D.000 of whom are avail
able for active operations, while Gen
eral Kuroki has 140.000 first-class
troops, the equal of those in European
armies.
"Under such conditions," the Stand
ard says, "the issue of the battle is
very seldom doubtful."
The Constantinople correspondent of
the Daily. Hail rends a report to the
effect that Kussla has suggested to
Turkey some scheme for capitalization
of the indemnity due by the latter for
Immediate payment to Russia as a
means of increasing the revenue for
>var purposes. %
On the hills to the westward of the
European concession the Japanese have
established several camps. Two or
three are of artillery, one is of trans
portation corps men, and one is of men
engaged in training animals for use in
the transportation service. The fine,
new schoolhouse, half way up the hill,
has been taken for a hospital, but is
not yet occupied.
It is in their horses that the Japa
nese are weakest. They are for the
most part thin, leggy little beasts, bad
tempered and ugly. A good many of
those here have already developed some
ailment or other. This afternoon I saw
a dozen or fifteen at one time brought
up to the veterinary for treatment. In
camp the horses are tied to picket lines
as in our army, but they stand near
enough to one another 'to make fighting
easy, and as they afe not heel-roped,
that is the main occupation. It is al
ways possible to see a couple of them
Industriously hammering away at eath
other with their heels. Farriers seem
to be plenty, and their field. outfit is
handy to carry. A bellows is Just a
wooden box about the size of an oil
case. A charcoal fire on the ground
serves for a forge, and the tools the
smith carries in his hands or pockets.
The weather is still cold, and across
the river there are plainly to be seen
mountain peaks covered with snow.
The frost is pretty well out of the
ground and soon the roads, which are
well-nigh impassible until the spring
thaw is over, will be settled. Then we
shall see. x
happens, he can only try again or j
philosophically go without.
Scores of curious little shops line the
streets. Many of them are kept by
Japanese, but a few of them are purely
Korean. -. They all keep a strange as
sortment of articles for sale, principally
cigarettes, of which each shop has mil
lions. They, are mostly of American
manufacture and Judging from the la
bels the tobacco trust must have work
ed off all its surplus stock for the last
â¢forty years upon the unsuspecting Ko
reans. Cigarettes are about the only
thing in <he tobacco line that these
shops do keep. Once in a while one
comes across a little plug or smok
ing tobacco, but the most .diligent
search failed to discover a single ci
gar.
The only evidences of willingness to
work that I saw on the part of the Ko
reans were given by a few men' fitfully
struggling with a clay bank Just, back
of the house where we are quartered,
and by the pack coolies who hung
about the landing place and wandered
through the streets. A Korean packer
is almost as good a load carrier as a
six-foot Mi&sourl mule. He rigs him
self out with a sort of pack saddle
fashioned of two sticks about three
feet long. These are bound together at
the top by a crosspiece lashed on with
flimsy cord made of twisted grass.
About a foot from the bottom another
crosepiece is similarly bound,- so that
the frame looks something like a let
ter H that has been knocked together
at the top. At right angles to the lower
crosspiece two arms are lashed, stand
ing out straight from the back of the
wearer. On these the load is lashed
fast by means of a line that runs from
the lower crosspiece up to the top one.
On one of these contrivances a '.husky
Korean will pack from 80 to 100 pounds
and tote it about comfortably all day.

On the night of the 19th Governor

Mrs. Hart is preparing a circular let

Alaska at the fair. The most serious of
these is that discrimination is used In
distributing literature of transportation
companies. Mrs. Hart says literature
of every legitimate company will be
distributed without especial favor to
any. The statement made in a St.

has shaken Alaska from Sitka to the

cost of erecting all the twenty- two

even less had the Esquimaux here be

President Wheeler decided he wanted
space and an energetic movement was
begun to secure it. Fortune seems to
favor California here and besides the
fair officials, knowing her reputation
for making handsome displays, are
quite willing to encourage her. Even
at the late date the university secured
one of the best spaces to be had. It
is the vestibule, 40x40 feet in dimen
sions. In the northeast corner of the
building, and is one of the main en
trances. Visitors passing through it
are confronted by the State's main
educational display, so the two are
thus fortunately made contiguous.
The material for the display pos
sessed by the university is said to be
of a superior quality and of sufficient

"Mr. Filcher has been coming down
here and 'butting in' by giving the
men orders when I am not around.
Many things done under his orders I
have had to undo. He should always
have spoken to me as chief of the de
partment. The commissioners should
follow the plans of generals in the
army and not give orders over the
heads of their department chief.
"Bad weather and railroad delay
made much of the material late in ar
riving. Filcher told Nevada County,

on its exhibit and I would make room
for it.
"The borax exhibit, which Is com

I expect it by the 20th. We will have
a fine mining display and it will be
ready as soon as most of the others."
Commissioner Filcher sticks to his
statement that Aubury should have
been here early and says the mineral
ogist is not a success at installation.
"Everything has been topsy turvy
in the mining department," he said,
"and I thotight we never would get a
mining display. I've had to spend a
lot of my time there and I can't be

rank I think I am a little bit higher
in our State than Mr. Filcher. Ever
since the commission has been ap

"When I demanded an explanation
of Mr. Filcher he simply said, 'You

Theodore J. Richardson, the Alaska

the first.
AUBURY MAKES REPLY.
In th* space ret apart for the Sacramento
VaJley counties there are four or five carloads
of case*, etc.. but net a lick has been struck
toward the Installation. Buck, Green and Will*
are here and promise to bÂ»gin work to-morrow,
but they won't, because it requires a day or
two to E?t out lumber, nails, etc., to work with.
Cut if they etart !n vigorously to-morrow the
best that can be said Is that they are a good
month behind. Since before I left California,
four weeks ago, we have been trying to push
them Into action, but from causes not clear
they have been slow in getting started. I have
been giving some of my time helping to plan
their Installation, and if not cramped for means
to put it up properly they have some good ma
terial and can yet make a good showing. The
delay of the counties has worried the commis
sion a good deal, as California has the reputa
tion of generally being ready; but in this case
the Indifference of some of the counties which
the sommlMioner* can't control Is 'going to re
flect on the State's good name and Is going to
hurt us In the matter of awards, as all mate
rial not in place on the opening day will lore
points In the final summing up of merit.
We are also behind In our mining exhibit.
Mr. Aubury knows \"ery little about installation
work and the commissioner* have been so much
In demand In the different departments thot
they couJd r.ot until the last week rive him as
ir.uch time as he needed. The work Is now
going on more eatiffactcrlly and will be rushed
MS rapidly as possible.- We ar* tupposed to
have the goods and we have tho space â more
than any other State â and If we can get a sat
isfactory mining Installation we will yet make
a showing in this department equal to our
merJU. If wo don't, it will not be the fault
of the coramitsion. as we are allowing Mr. Au
bury more money for the mining exhibit â con
siderably moreâ than will be expended in any
other department.
Finally. Mr. Kdltor. ear to Â«J1 the other ed
itor: not to come here before the latter part of
May. There are lots of exhibitors further be
hind than California, and if you come on thÂ«
13;h. as suggested, you will see very little for
your money. J. A. FILCHER.
GREEN IS CKITICIZED.
In general embellishments Mi?Â»ouri takes the
lead, as she had a million dollars of State
money and has epent it liberally In decorative
installation. Her facaue* alone in the agricult
ural building cost $2s.000. while California 1 *
facades around a much larger space in the
feame building cost about $3000. and yet the
difference !a rot discreditable to our State.
There is something In knowing how to do these
things so as to get the. best results with the
least outlay. I rejrpet to say that we will not
nearly be ready In the agricultural building on
the opening day. It Is here the counties are
located, and some of them seem almost crimi
nally Indifferent. N*ar!y all the southern
counties have their exhibits in plate, and San
Joaquin County Is practically complete. Santa
Clara is next with Its work, and then in order
come Alameda. Contra Cr.na. Fresno, Kings,
San Luis Obispo and Monterey.
Ed. Herald: If this reaches you in time, and
I presume It will, you can publish it in your
lssuÂ» of the rame date of the formal opening
of this the bi(?gesi exposition ever held In the
world. To tell your readers of the situation in
detail would be more than I can undertake,
but I can give you some idt-a of the position of
California and how it is Iiktly to show up oa
the opening day.
The State building is practically completed.
The furniture is htre and it will be put In
place in time to open the building to the public
on the day of the opening of the fair. Owing
to the risk of bringing tender plants here too
early, ours are just arriving and some of them
will no doubt have to be set out after the fair
oi^ns. OtherwlM- cur walks are made and our
grounds are in fairly good hhape.
Our forestry- exhibit will be practically com
pleted when Roosevelt touches the button that
will start the machinery for the fair next Sat
urday, or about the time your readers will be
perusing this letter. The Eame is true of our
educational exhibit and of our horticultural ex
hibit. These three are State features and un
der the personal direction of the commission.
No effort has been spared to have them ready.
I can say also that in each of these depart
ments California Is roing to make a very
creditable showing. IVe have reached that
ttace now in which comparisons can be made,
and the comparison of California's showing In
the departments named with what others have
thus far exposed brings no blush to the proud
and exacting Californian.

offices- in San Francisco, but is
now. president of the Grand Trunk road
of Montreal, is visiting the fair. In
company with T. S. Cunningham, the
telegraph superintendent. Mr. Hays
visited the California display. He was
genuinely pleased with it and took
the same pride in the display that a
Califcrrnian would. "The State has a
great future," he said, "and her devel
opment will be rapid from this on. It
Is toward California that Eastern mon
ey and Eastern farmers who want new
homes, are looking largely now. The ex
hibits made at this fair will be of great
benefit to California, for they, are of a
nature that educate and impress."
Mr. Cunningham is one of the Cali
fornians who is doing the State : good
here. He Is of genial and accommodat
ing disposition and an intelligent con
versationalist and meets - many people
of: influence and wealth, to whom he
Commissioner Harris made a tour of
inspection and found that the corn
grown in other States, even including j
Kansas and Missouri, is no better than
that of the Golden State, and that few
equal California in the smaller cereals.
"Many of the farmers*on the Eastern
prairies who look to corn and the other
cereals to bring them wealth," said
Mr. Harris, "may admire our beautiful |
fruits and even think longingly of the
land where they are grown, but are
likely to say, 'I don't know anything
about growing fruit, and besides I
can't wait for something to come in
while the trees .ire maturing; 1 guess
I'd better stay here where I know there I
is money in alfalfa and corn and hogs.'
We in California know that all the ce
reals can be grown there in the great
est quantities, but that it pays better to
use a great deal of the land for more
valuable crops. The Eastern farmer
who may desire to go to California
should be taught that he can grow al
falfa and corn and raise cattle and
hogs there better than he can In the
East and that he can have a steady in
come from these while gradually ac
quiring orchards and vineyards if he de
sires to grow the more valuable pro
ducts. Oranges and grapes will not al
ways appeal to the farmer who is
aware that his knowledge is greatest
about corn and livestock. All settlers
can embark in any line of farming they
desire in California, and I think it is
wisdom to teach them this. Many
Easterners have been greatly surprised
at seeing the corn Kings County grows
and have said they didn't know such
could be raised successfully In the
State." )Â¦
The State Commissioners hoped to
make a cereal display, but found no
room for it. They may yet make such
an exhibit.
W. N. Harris, the Kings County
Commissioner, believes in showing the
practical Eastern farmers something of
the agricultural products which have
been their stay and backbone, just to
illustrate to them that those things
grow as abundantly in California as
they do elsewhere. His is the only
county making a special display of
corn and grains, and as Kings stands
near the center of the California space,
this display serves for the whole State.
In it are shown dent and milling corn,
wheat, barlty, rye oats and broom and
Egyptian corn. These are arranged in
square columns and on the upper part of
the central structure of the Kings dis
play. Corn fourteen feet high stands
against the columns and ears fourteen

There is $5000 on hand for installation.

its installation will be superintended
by Professor Galen Howard, the uni

assisted by several of the students.
The central figure will be a relief map
of the university grounds.
The exhibit should be very handsome,
if installed in conformity with the spa

Minnie Lee Collins of Tennessee says Peruna cured her of female trouble
after the best physicians had failed.
Mrs. Minnie Lee Collins, grandniece ot the late President James K. Polk,
writes from 912 High Street, Nashville. Tenn.:
"for several years I experienced a severe attack of female trouble. The best
physicians prescribed for me. but without avail. Two years ago I began to take Pe-
runa at the advice of a friend. I noticed a perceptible improvement at once; after
taking several bottles I was cured. I hold Peruna in high esteem and am always
ready to say a good word lor it."â U INN IE LEE COLLINS.

did no sight-seeing. A gentle spring
rain, which began this morning after
a long spell of balmy sunshiny weath

and besides the members of the party
were tired after the trip.
The Californians were met at the
Union station by Commissioner Filcher
and George'C. Roeding. The train was
due at 7:30, but did not arrive until
1:30. Secretary Fletcher had wired
ahead for rooms and the members of

of the Californians already here and
made to feel at home. "V.vX-

PRESIDENTS .MESSAGE. -
The following telegram from Presi
dent Roosevelt was read amid great
enthusiasm and the reading was fol
lowed by three cheers, in which all
the delgates joined standing:
"WASHINGTON, May 16.â Aldcn
Anderson^ President State League o'
Republican Clubs, Sacramento, Cal.:
Permit me through you to extend to
the members of the State League of
Clubs my hearty greetings and cor
dial good wishes for n successful meet
ing. THEODORE ROOSEVELT."
Major Andrew G. Meyers of Siski
you, vice president of the league, took
the chair while Anderson retired to
prepare the committee lists. He called
Attorney General U. S. Webb to the
platform for a short address. Webb
said in part:
There never was a time when the people of
this country found so much In our party's
record to approve as they do now, or when
our opponents could find so little to condemn.
Never has a party approached a presidential
election with so slight reason for asking a
chan-e of administration as does the opposi
tion to-day. All classes of our citizens are
better employed and better paid than has ever
been the case in any other age in any country
under the sun.
Under Republican policies our country has
fought out the Spanish War, given liberty to
Cuba, achieved good government in Porto Rico
and the Philippines and placed Itself at the
head of the column of nations In the march
of progress. Under the leadership of the be
loved McKinley and the matchless Roosevelt
(cheers) the United States has been redeemed
from financial prostration and placed on a
pinnacle of prosperity. The people of our
country do not want to go back to the day of
Democratic misrule and misery. (Applause.)
CATOR 3IAKES SPEECH.
Thomas V. Cator of San Francisco
was listened to with interest while he
declared that the old fight of States'
rights versus national supremacy was
being raised bv the Democrats from
the grave as a forlorn hope for the
coming campaign. In part he said:
The recent decision of th; Supreme Court in
the mercer case was dissented from by the
Democratic Justices, who aligned themselves
on the extreme State's rights position, and
Democratic leaders are already planning to
obtain the support' of the trusts r on a promise
to reverse ,the great Republican doctrine that
Congress has authority of interstate commerce
and over corporations operating throughout
the country. But while the Democracy is
flirting with the trusts. In the hope of gaining
control of the Government, the people of this
country will support the Republican party In
enforcing the constitutional powers of Con
gress over ail corporations that affect the In
terests of the whole people.
Judge H. A. Pierce of Los Angeles
followed with a telling and humorous
arraignment of the Democracy for its
inability to formulate a constructive
policy' or to follow intelligent leader
ship.
though he is, he won the applause of
his Republican hearers by his ref
erence of patriotism to the gathering.
His address of welcome to the dele
gates was as follows:
In the name of the- city of Sacramento and
in response to the courteous request of the
president of the league the pleasant task falls
upon me to welcome the delegates of the Cali
fornia State League of Republican Clubs, and
in extending that welcome there goes with it
the gi-nerous hospitality of our people and the
freedom of their city. Notwithstanding that
this convention is wholly partisan in its make
up, we know that its deliberations will be
marked by patriotic Impulse and sentiment,
and it is in the knowledge of this fact that all
of our citizens, irrespective of their political
alliances, the more deeply appreciate the honor
pf having the capital city of the State chosen
as the place for the holding of these conven
tions'.
Sacramento enjoys the reputation of being
the ideal convention city of the State and we
arc satisfied that the committee of arrange
ments, in providing for the comfort and en
tertainment of the city'* guests, has lrft noth
ing undone that will in any measure detract
from that well-deserved reputation. We want
to feel that when the delegates and visitors
to tills convention return to their respective
homes they will bear with them only kindly
remembrances of time well spent and pleas
antly enjoyed.
In conclusion Mr. President, I will now
leave the convention in the hands of Its pre
siding officer and the city of Sacramento In
the hands of the California State League of
Republican Clubs. Gentlemen of the conven
tion, the city is your?.
On behalf of the Republican clubs
of Sacramento, Senator Robert T. Dev
lin then welcomed the delegates, say
ing in part:
Throughout the United States and in every
land where men are free government Is car
ried on by agency of parties. Organization is
necessary for crystallization of principles Into
policies and their enforcement in administra
tion. When all of us shall have parsed away
the deeds of the Republican party will live
as long as there Is a poet to sins: the epic of
its great achievements. Americans will not
permit the flag planted under Republican aus
pices to be hauled down.
Our friends, the enemy, are distracted by
their effort to find a candidate behind whom
they can march during the coming campaign
with some pretense of harmony. No such
trouble afflicts us. All Republicans nre united
in proclaiming their allegiance to that splendid,
incorruptible! statesman, the hero of El CanÂ»-y,
the presrnt worthy occupant of the White
House. (Cheers.) It Is under favoring skies,
therefore and with high hopes of a groat tri
umph, that the club* of this city welcome you
hero to-day.
ANDERSON MAKES ANSWER.
President Anderson in response said,
among other things:
It is one of the highest functions Â»t citizen
ship to participate in political action. Only
by using this right can we insure good gov
ernment As partisans we have come here be
cause we believe this country can best thrlvÂ»
under Republican policies and because we
deem those policies in consonance with the
principles of sound constitutional government.
After these brief addresses the con
vention got down to business at once.
Colonel George H. Pippy, president of
the San Francisco Union League,
moved that the chair appoint a com
mittee on' credentials consisting of one
delegate at large, and three from each
Congressional district. The motion
prevailed. Committees on order of
SACRAMENTO, May 15.â Ferdinand
K. Rule of Los Angeles will be presi
dent of the State League of Republican
Clubs during the next two years. It
has been conceded for several days that
the southern part of the State was en
titled to the honor and would get it if
the southern delegates could unite on
a candidate. The, friends of Senator
M. L. Ward of San Diego were per
sistent in demanding the office for their
man and until a late hour to-night
Ward seemed to have the lead. After
the convention adjourned this evening,
however, a conference of the friends
of Ward and Rule was held and the
situation fully discussed. Shortly be
fore midnight Ward announced that he
had withdrawn in favor of Rule and
would place him in nomination to
morrow.
This action in favor of harmony
makes certain Rule's election as presi
dent of the league. It is said also to
make Ward's nomination as Congress
man in the Eighth District equally cer
tain, that being one of the matters dis
cussed in to-night's conference.
Rule Is a well-known Los Angeles
capitalist, being one of the directors of
Senator Clark's new San Pedro, Los
Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad. Two
years ago he was the delegate-at-large
from California to the convention of
the National League of Republican
Clubs at Chicago and then obtained a
pledge that the meeting of that or
ganization in 1906 will be held at Los
Angeles.
The California Republican campaign
of 1904 was opened here this afternoon
when Lieutenant Governor Alden An
derson, president of the State League
of Republican Clubs, called the fourth
biennial convention of that organiza
tion to order. Party enthusiasm and
loyalty to the principles and policies
of Republicanism had brought to
gether a host of delegates from every
section of the State. Others are ar
riving in large numbers on this even
ing's trains and at to-morrow's ses
sion at least 1000 representatives of
the seventy clubs in the league will
be here.
The assembly chamber at the Capi
tol had been magnificently decorated
with California flowers, palms and
ferns for the convention by a local
committee, and the speaker's desk was
flanked by portraits of McKinley and
Roosevelt framed in golden poppies.
About the room were hung portraits
of the other ReuubJican Presidents.
The afternoon session was chiefly
devoted to organization, but a number
of rattling Bpeeches were delivered,
and delegates showed their temper by
prolonged cheers for every mentton of
the names of McKinley and Roosevelt.

The evening session of the conven
tion was a great mass-meeting, at
which a large audience of Republicans
listened to well-known State leaders
and pledged anew their support to the
party In the fall campaign. Lieutenant
Governor Anderson was again in the
chair.- The best speech of the evening
was made by Governor Pardee. The
Governor was greeted with prolonged
cheers and spoke to the subject, "Why
California Should Stand In the Repub

things:
EVENING SESSION.
Senator E. I. Wolfe of San Francisco
came up to the Capital City armed
with a resolution favoring the San
Francisco sea wall bond issue. This
resolution he will ask the club league
convention to include in its platform
and this will doubtlessly be done. The
same resolution, which is backed both
by the San Francisco Chamber of
Commerce and by the California Pro
motion Committee, Â¦ will be introduced
in the Republican and Democratic
State Conventions, as it is wholly a
non-partisan matter. Wolfe's resolu
tion is as follows:
We favor tho adoption of the proposal sub
mitted by the Legislature to the people of this
State to issue State bonds to the amount of
$2,000,000 for the improvement of the San Fran
cisco water front by the completion of Its sea
wall, known as the San Francisco seawall art,
because the increasing commerce of the Pacific
imperatively demands better harbor accommo
dations on the coast. If San Francisco does
not furnish them the ports of other States will,
to the injury of the trade of San Francisco and
fÂ»till more to the detriment of the people of
the great interior who are served by that port.

SOME) OF THE PROMINENT MEN "WHO TOOK PART IN THE CONVENTION OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEAGUE OF RE
PUBLICAN CLUBS FROM AMONG WHOM MOST OF THE IMPORTANT OFFICERS OF THE ORGANIZATION WILL BE
CHOSEN WHEN BALLOTING BEGINS.
M. F. Tarpey, director in California
of the Hearst campaign, is a hard
loser, and the members of the Alameda
County delegation, which he chose- to
call "my delegation," felt the lash of
his tongue upon the adjournment of
the afternoon session to-day. In re
turn Mr. Tarpey also felt the lash of
invective. When the motion for ad
journment had been carried Mr. Tar
pey turned to the Alameda delegation
and said:
"All of you that voted for Mr. Jeter
to-day are my friends and I invite you
to partake of my hospitality in my
private headquarters. AH of you that
did not vote for Mr. Jeter I consider
are not my friends and I do not want
to have anything to do with you."
S. Bachrach of the Forty-ninth As
sembly District, Alameda County,
called Tarpey to account in very plain
language and when he dropped the
matter W. C. Donnelly of the Forty
seventh took up the roast of Hearst's
manager. Thomas J. Thompson of
the Fiftieth District next took a fling
at Tarpey, but he was not to be beaten
out; he was angry clear through.
"Well, what I said stands." he re
plied to the grilling he had received,
"and those of you that didn't stand
for me to-day can get out."
With the assertion that they would
stay long as any man In the conven
tion his opponents went out and
Tarpey walked away with his ad
herents.
defeated Franklin K. Lane for the Gov
ernorship by a narrow majority; and,
"Whereas, His gross and malicious
exaggeration of the few sporadic cases
of bubonic plague in California, leading
to the quarantining of the exports of.
the State, and his attractively lurid
accounts of crime and vice in Califor
nia, are but fair samples of his settled
policy of coining newspaer circulation
out of the alleged misfortunes of his
native State; and.
"Whereas, He has besmirched the
fair reputation of California manhood
by the publication under his own signa
ture of pages of grossly immodest
praise of his own virtues and grossly
dishonest representations of promised
support in his candidacy for the Presi
dency;
"Now, therefore, we. the Democratic
Convention of the State of California,
denounce William Randolph Hearst as
a betrayer of the Democratic party and
a traitor to the State of his birth, and
we further Instruct our delegates to
present the above resolution to the Na
tional Convention in St. Louis."
There is gossip to the effect that
another resolution similar to the fore
going will be presented to the com
mittee.
At the regular meeting of the Asso
ciated Veterans of the Mexican War
the following resolution was adopted:
"Resolved. By the Associated Vet
erans of the Mexican War, that this
association, whose officers and many
of its members are familiar with the
affairs and management of the Vet
erans' Home of California hereby cor
dially join with the Grand Army of the
Republic in its expressions of con
fidence in the management of the
home by the present board of direc
tors, and also In Its conduct of the
canteen, which was established at the
home many years ago for good and
sufficient reasons, more especially as
an absolute necessity as a preventive
against saloons outside and for the
health and discipline of the members.
There are many veterans of the Mex
ican War cared for at this home, and
this association is proud of the in
stitution, which It has helped to estab
lish and which it assists in manage
ment through Its representatives."
Veterans Express Confidence.
J. J. Gosper of Los Angeles told the
delegates of "Illustrious Names on Re
publican Party Rolls," and enthusiastic
applause greeted his reference to great
leaders of the party, past and present.
T. H. Selvage of Eureka, the last
speaker of the evening, talked of "The
Young Man in Politics." Selvage de
clared that the worst enemy of the
United States was the indifference of
young men to political duty.
It Is announced this evening that the
deadlock in the First Congressional
District over the delegation to the Chi
cago National Convention has been
broken! sufllcient votes having been se
cured by John C. Bull Jr. and C. E.
Clinch to elect them. Senator Voorhies
of Amador, wno made a good fight for
the honor, will be consoled with a place
upon the Republican ticket for Presi
dential Elector in California.
The Republican party has beÂ°n the rarty of
industrial advance. Our country owes to it
the fostering rare which has made the United
States the first Industrial nation in the world.
The Republican party stands for that system
of tariff which says to the foreign manu
facturer: "We propose to protect our working
mi's by differential duties In favor of our
home Industry." Cleveland said: â¢"Your tariff
system has failed because we have 1,000,000
unemployed nun walking our streets." But a
few years of Cleveland gave us 4. 000,000 of
unemployed, rtarving men, and It was not
until that matchless leader of men. William
McKinley. was placed in the White House
that American working mÂ»n a pain saw pros
perity. To-day European countries are won
dering 1 how they can meet our competition.
The Russo-Japanese war la being: fought
with American ships and American guns. We
have 7.000,000 w(,rk?rs in this country under
Republican protective policies. The number
has doubled s>lnce ISOfl. This is the more
reason the Republican party should be kept
i npower. in order that we may hold the mar
kets of the world and preserve the American
working man in his ability to earn good wages.
WARD FOR PRESIDENT.
"The Republican Party and the
Wage-earnCr'.' was the subject of the
next address, by Duncan McKinlay of
Santa Rosa. He said in part:
Secretary of State Charles F. Curry
made a forceful speech on "Organiza

the Republican party was pre-eminent

and that its pathway was free from

all. with no captain to command It and no

.Chairman Ruef then called for a vote
ind the four gentlemen whose names
â¢'had been proposed were selected as the
â¢ choice of the local delegation for dele
gates at large and the delegates
'.yledgrd themselves to promote the
randidacy of the four at the Sacra
mento convention and to give them all
possible support.
'It was then suggested that an ar
rangement be made by which the San
Franrisco delegation go to the capital
cUj in a body. The matter was dis
cussed for some time, but it %vas found
.that the convenience of all could not

< d and carried that an many of the del
*f;ntes as possible leave on the 3:30
train this afternoon. The entire dele-
Ratiofl was instructed to meet at the
Golden Eagle Hotel in Sacramento on
Wednesday at 1 o'clock in the after
noon. This being all the business on
Â«>hand. a motion to adjourn was put and
carried.
Chairman Ruef then stated the ap
portionment of delegates to the Na
tional Convention, both for Congres
p-iona! districts and at large, and called
for opinions on the proposition of the
San Francisco delegation expressing
itself in favor of certain delegates at
large. Sentiment in favor of this
seemed to prevail and the name of Ruef
was first offered. Ruef declined the
'commission and A. K. Daggett placed
the name of George C. Pardee be
fore the assemblage. Colonel George
Stone said he believed Southern Cali
.foriria should be accorded some recog
nition, as that section of the State did
much toward promoting the interests of
the Republican party, and offered as
his selection Judge J. W. McKinley of
Los Angeles. The name of George A.
Knight was next proposed, after which
Charles G. Clinch proposed the name of
John D. Spreckels.
SELECT DELEGATES AT LARGE.
Immediately afterward W. W. San
derson offered the following, which was
ulsv adopted:
â¢Resolved, That the committee on
platform and resolutions of the Repub
lican State Convention be requested to
insert in its report a strong recommen
dation and indorsement of the econom
ical, business-like and able administra
tion "of the State government by Hon.
<?eorge C. Pardee, Governor of Califor
nia."
After Ruef had taken his seat,
; Charles G. Clinch proposed the name
" of Maxwell McNutt for secretary and
thai gentleman found no opposition
for the place. The roll call was dis
rw-nsed with and Colonel George Stone
offered the following resolution, which
jvas adopted by a rising vote:
â¢"Resolved, That the San Francisco
deleg-ates unanimously urge instruc
tion by the State Republican Conven
â¢tion of its delegates to the National
Republican Convention In favor of the
nomination as candidate for the Re
publican party as President of the
United States of that illustrious sol
dier, statesman and citizen, Theodore
Roosevelt."
Tom Riordan occupied the chair
nnd called the meeting to order. He
Ftated its purposes and requested the
election of a permanent chairman and
Fecretary. D. W. Burchard arose and
nominated Ruef. In doing bo he said
he was proposing the name of a man
loyal to party and friends and
one in whom the delegation might
j.lace its trust. Ruef was chosen by
acclamation and was escorted to the
chair. Ruef then thanked the dele
gates for the honor they had conferred
upo'rf him and made a brief address,
in wh^ch he urged independence on
â¢the part of each district representa
tive and a rebuke to the custom of go
ing into conventions without a choice
or a candidate and following in a path
l^iat has been marked out by others.
"Let us have some preference," said
the epeaker. "Let us gro prepared to
whom we wish and to speak for
ourselves."

Car No. 568 of the Eddy street elec
tric line, white running at a high rate
of speed down the hill between Octavia
and Lagruna streets about 6 o'clock last
night crashed into a Tight wagon
driven by H. A. Blaettler of the Mon
terey Dairy. The driver was thrown
from his seat and dragged some dis
tance. The horse was knocked down
by tha force of the collision and he
rolled nearly fifty feet. Both were
painfully Injured. Many of the pas
sengers jumped from the car, but only
one, W. Bliss, suffered injury.
The car was in charge of Conductor
Green. The motorman refused to give
his name to the Injured people, saying
it was a matter of no Importance.
Blaettler asserts that no warning bell
was rung and that be did not have
time to stop his horse at the crossing
after he saw the car rushing down
upon him. The motorman cays he rang
the bell, but the driver of the milk
wagon Is positive that he did not. The
carmen sought the names of passen
gers who were witnesses to the acci
dent and then attempted to get the
driver to sign a card exonerating
them from responsibility for the colli
sion, but upon the advice of passengers
he refused to subscribe his name.
Blaettler Was badly bruised and suf
fered from severe shock.' Bliss was cut
about the face. The horse was batter
ed up and both wagon and car were
smashed. All the front windows in
the latter were shattered and frag
ments of glass showered upon passen
gers who were riding on the "dummy."
A report of the accident was made at
the company's headquarters and an In
vestigation for the purpose of ascer
taining who was to blame will be com
menced at once.

SANTA CRUZ. May 16. â A delegate
who represents an interior county said
to a Call representative to-night:
"Mr. Tarpey made a blunder to-day
when he insisted on making a vote on
the chairmanship a test of the
strength of the Hearst sentiment in
the convention.'
"Two motions introduced by him
and intended to give Hearst a dis
tinct advantage were also defeated.
He chose his own battleground and

for the anti-Hearst delegates, the in

There were four deaths during the

sergeant of the Twenty-ninth Infantry,
fell out of 'his bunk while the ship was
pitching in a heavy sea and broke his
The transport Sherman arrived in
port yesterday from Manila and drop
ped anchor at quarantine station at 2:45
p. m., but it was nearly 8 o'clock be
fore her passengers were landed at the
transport dock. The delay was caused
by the rush of work the quarantine of
ficers had on hand yesterday, and also
by the temporary breaking down of the
i tug Steinberg, which is used by the
quarantine officers in making their
rounds.
The Sherman brought her full com
plement of officers and enlisted men.
This included the .Twenty-ninth In
fantry from Manila and the Sixty-sixth
and Sixty-seventh companies Coast
Artillery from Honolulu. v
Quartermaster Captain Taggart re
ports the voyage uneventful. The un
usually long run from Nagasaki to
Honolulu was occasioned by the poor
quality of -coal. The trooper was de
layed a day at Honolulu awaiting the
arrival of the Thomas from this port
with the Twenty-eighth and Ninety
second companies Coast Artillery,
bound to Honolulu. The moment the
Thomas hove in sight the Sherman
got under steam for this port.
Among the passengers was Captain
John F. Madden, whose name has been
prominently drawn before the public
by his divorce suit now pending. He
was greeted by his father and mother
and his little three-year-old son, John,
who'|Weht out on the tugr Slocum to
welcome him. Captain Madden stated
thathe had absolutely nothing to say
for publication. He was in the hands
of his attorney, who would prepare a
statement for use at the proper time.
He had returned with his regiment and
would be with them at the Presidio for
the next few days. He could not say
whether he would go on with his regi
ment to its new station, or whether
he would remain here, to be present
at the divorce proceedings, which will
begin on June 6.
Colonel Benjamin C. Lockwood,
commander of the Twenty-ninth In
fantry, when asked about matters in
the Philippines, and whether he had
anything of interest to tell concerning
his regiment, put both hands over his
lips, turned his back on his question- '
ers and walked away without uttering
a word.
Passing Conferedate bills in San
Francisco is getting to be as easy as
taking candy from a baby or buying
laud from Indians for a handful of
beads and .a bunch of feathers.
One of the most remarkable cases of
thf Confederate bill swindle, involving
a clever police catch also, arose on
Sunday afternoon, when Policeman
Charles \V. Brown arrested John M.
Connell. alias John Xoble, for forg
ing and passing a fictitious check and
for passing a quantity of old Confed
erate bills.
Connell put up such a strong story
and bore such an Innocent look that
Acting Lieutenant Donovan, Corporal
McGee, who put the prisoner through
a severe fire of questions, and the ar
resting policeman were inclined to be
lieve the old crook's story.
A LAVISH SPENDER.
Connell passed Confederate bills to
the amount of $40 on Richard Ramac
c Ixitti. a wine dealer at 615 Commercial
street, on Saturday and Sunday after
noons. When the licuor dealer ques
tioned the genuineness of the bills
Conntll wrote him a check on the
"Bank of San Jose for the sum of $68
and left it as security.
Connell. spent his money so freely
that Ramacciotti called in Policeman
Brown and the arrest followed.
. Brown learned that Connell had
bought $150 worth of Confederate bills
from a pawn shop on Saturday after
noon. The possessor of the bills went
to Ramacc'otti's wine house and after
; working off his worthless paper on .the
unsophisticated liquor dealer, got glor
'iously drunk and for six hours Ramac
ciotti did the biggest business of his
life. He ser\-ed drinks to Connell and
every old bum that happened along.
â¢3ie did not know that it was his treat,
and as the bibulous crowd sapped up
the wine and whisky they gazed on
Connell with admiration.
The spender was welcomed as a good
angel that had come to relieve the
ihirsty wanderers of Commercial
street. Those that staked freely and
Flaked often ran forth in search of
friends with parched tongues and the
Bacchanalian revel was a holiday and
Â» memory. . The Italian barkeep's busi
ness grew, accompanied by a suspicion
that all was not well.
WITT GOODS RUN LOW.
By the time Policeman Brown ar
*rived Ramacciotti's wet goods were
runjiing low and his till was bulging
with rebel bills. Connell was at once
. taken before Detective Sergeant Bain
bVjdge, the man of marvelous memory.
The moment "Tim," the old identifier,
eaw Connell. he said: 'Hello, John,"
and remembered that Connell had
\ served five terms for passing checks
and Confederate bills. Bainbridge had
not seen Connell for seventeen years,
but he identified him immediately,
donnell wae booked for violating sec
tion 648 of the penal code, which re
fers to the uttering of a bogus check.
When confronted with the record of
his crimes the prisoner took the dis
covery good naturedly and said: "Well,
I never did get into trouble until I got
drunk."
Connell. who is 57 years of age, has
â¢fpent twenty-three years of his life'
behind the walls of California's peni- 'Â¦
tentiaries. He was sent up for five
' years from Merced; nine years on two
different charges from San Francisco;
four years from Napa County, where
"he treated all of the Napa County po
lice on the change from Confederate
rotes- before his arrest, and five years |
from San Francisco, when Judge Saw
yer sat on the bench in the Circuit
Court. Each sentence Connell received j
was for passing fictitious checks and !
Confederate bills. The last time he
served was from Napa County. He j
Â¦was released from San Quentin on De- '
cember 24 of Jast year.

The meeting was called to order by
Major F; S. Rice, who introduced
Chancellor H. S. Dumble of Bakers
field Lodge, who gave an address of
welcome. He was followed by H. A.
Jasttro on behalf of the citizens and
thc responses were eloquently made by
Grand Chancellor B. V. Sargent, Chief
Mrs. :.:nude Berry Sheehan of the
Rathbom- Sisters and Brigadier Gen
eral McGlashen for the uniform rank.
The speakers all devoted much atten
tion to the principles of fraternal or
ders in general and the Knights in par
ticular, laying stress upon the fact that
it is a distinctively American order. *
To-morrow night at Armory Hall the
secret work will be exemplified by Sun
set Temple of the Rathbone Sisters,
after which there will be a social ses
sion for the public.
Following is a list of the delegates
and alternates: .

Among those in attendance are many
of the leading business and profes
sional men and officials of the State. A
more representative gathering it would
be difficult to find than that which will
be called to order by Grand Chancellor
Sargent to-morrow morning. Armory
Hall, the largest place of assembly in
Bakersfield, to-night presented a lively
scene. The interior was a mass of
flags and bunting. Every seat on the
floor and gallery was taken and prob
ably not less than 1500 people were
crowded into the building, many stand
ing at the door unable to obtain a seat
in spite of the preparations made for
their convenience. On the platform
were the members of the uniform rank,
the officers of the Knights and
the Rathbones. the officers of the local
Knights, the City Trustees and County
Supervisors.
MANY NOTABLES ATTEND.
About one thousand strangers are in
the city to-night. They have been
coming in on every train from both
north and south; but the major part
of them were on the special from San
Francisco which arrived at 5:30 this
evening.
When the Knights come to select
their meeting place for next year it is
expected that there will be several
towns to contest for the honor. San
Luis Obispo has already announced its
candidacy. Delegate E. C. Frye of that
place has declared his intention of cap
turing the meeting for his home and
is now conducting an active canvass
among the delegates. There will also
be an interesting contest for the office
of grand prelate. This is regarded as
a certain stepping stone to the office of
Grand chancellor. It being the custom
to promote the incumbents of the sev
eral offices above the rank of prelate
in rotation each year.
One candidate who is already here
and who has announced his intention
to stand for election is Dr. Bagley of
Santa Maria. Last year the doctor
was a candidate and had a large fol
lowing. This year he comes backed
by strong support in the south and
the coast country. Others are expect
ed to announce themselves shortly.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal.. May 16.â
Never before in the history of Bakers
field has the city presented such a
scene of brilliancy as that here to
night. With 1800 lights, scores of
Pythian standards and hundreds of
flags and streamers of buntingn cover
ing some ten blocks of the city beneath
the huge pyramid, the sight is inspir
ing. The military band discourses mu
sic to hundreds of people who block
the streets on both sides, the hotels
and lodging-houses are crowded with
visiting Knights and their families and
everywhere are seen the signs of wel
come to the visitors.

WHEN the volcanic eruptions in Guatemala last
year covered the coffee fincas, it was believed
that the industry was ruined and that Guatemala
had received a blow from which recovery would be slow,
as coffee is her leading product for export. When the
volcanic ash fell last year's crop had been already se
cured, amounting to 500,000 quintals. Many planters
abandoned their ash covered plantations and believed
themselves ruined. But the activity of the volcanoes
was followed by heavy and long continued rains, which
washed away a great deal of the ashes and incorporated
more of them with the soil. The rain also seemed to leach
the ashes and extract from it a liquid fertilizer which
proved of great benefit to the coffee trees. The result is
a great improvement in the fincas that were supposed to
be ruined, and a large increase in the crop, so that this
year the export will be 700,000 quintals.
In some respects the much feared deposits of ashes
proved of as great benefit as an overflow of the Nile to
the land which it inundates. The fertility distributed by
volcanic action is seen in Hawaii, where the volcanic
sand makes the best sugar cane land, and in the valley of
the Snake River in Idaho, where exactly the same kind of
sand proves the most valuable soil for sugar beets. Much
of the fertility of the white ash soils. of the San Joaquin
Valley, in this State, is due to its percentage of volcanic
ash deposited when the valley was an inland sea. In
turn this ash is a constituent of the alluvium carried by
the streams to the tule and delta lands of the Sacramento
and San Joaquin rivers, which are believed to be the rich
est soils in the world.
Hereafter when the volcanoes of Guatemala erupt and
spout ashes the only unfortunate. coffee planters will be
those* whose fincas are outside of the showers. The
users of the coffee. will be interested in knowing whether
the quality of the berry has been improved with the quan
tity.!

Not Trustzvorthy.
A good story is going the rounds
about a well-known newspaper artist
and a prominent business man. It ap
pears that some two years ago the
artist was in financial straits and made
a borrow of his friend, who was the
head of a prosperous firm. The sum
loaned the artist was Â§2000 and he
agreed to repay it within two years.
The business man happened to be
flush at the time, so the prospect of
waiting two years for his money did
not bother him much.
The two years passed by and the
artist had not made even a partial
payment. He did not 'Â¦even call upon
the busines man to explain his dere
liction, in fact though he met his
friend almost daily he did not even
mention the fact that he was duly
grateful or in any way make an
acknowledgment of the kindness. Six
month3 after the debt became due the
business man met with reverses and
he found himself very much in need
of the $2000. Accordingly he wrote to
the artist and asked him to try to find
him a little money. His letter brought
back the answer: "Sorry, old man, but
it is impossible."
A-month went by and the business
man found himself more in need of
the money than ever. He determined
to make a personal appeal to the
artist and sent for him. When the
latter appeared the business man lost
no time and informed the artist that
he must have the money. Its a case of
ruin unless part of it Is forthcoming
almost immediately," he said. "Just
make an effort and see if you cannot
raise $500. I'll tell you what I'll do.
Get 5 500 'for me to-morrow and inside
of two weeks I'll let you have it back."
"That's a very decent proposition,"
said the artist, rumlnatively, "and. old
man. 1,'d take it. but I'm afraid I can
not trust you."

Heigh-ho!â it's an age ago.
And yet. it was yesterday
You stood hero in the blossoms.
And the world was singing. "May!"
And you laughed to see those blossom*
with the frolic wind at play!
Don't you remember â the children
Were playing in the street.
And clapped their hands as the breezes
tossed
The violets at your feet?
And came, and asked to kiss you â those
lips so red and sweet!
And you said, of a bird's glad singing.
There â in the bloom and light;
"He sings, 'Love says, good morning.
And never knows Rood night!' "
(O, the skies were blue as the eyes of
you. and the clouds were fast in
flight!)
The seasons are brief dreamers!^
River, and field, and plain
Laugh ir. the light of morning;
Dear, it is May again!
And the bird that sang of the love yotk
dreamed, sings of that love in
vain !
And I see the rosy children
There â in the dear old street.
And I wonder if they are dreaming
Of a vanished face and sweet â
If the lips they kissed are mourned â ar*
missed â if they long those lips to
meet?
I would kiss their rosy faces â
Fair as Rowers i' the dew;
But the bird up there Is singing.
And my kisses went with you!
And tfie rain of the years; â love's bitte?

Success.
THE stablemen's strike in this city has proceeded
on the usual lines of picket and boycott, of which
the community is tolerant while they are peaceably
pursued. .But the peace has been repeatedly broken and
the breach has been condoned by the officers of the law
until the expected has happened- Gathering courage
from immunity the violent men, who deny to others the
rights claimed for themselves, have resorted to violent
assaults, carried out in the most cowardly way.
On Sunday four men under the leadership of one who
has enjoyed official leniency until he seems to have as
sumed that he carries a license to violence, set upon a
peaceable citizen working inoffensively at his vocation
under the protection of the laws of his country, and
dragging him from his wagon proceeded to attempt al
most his murder. The four ruffians jumped on him while
prostrate, beat and kicked him in his face and body, and
the leader, with a pitchfork for a weapon, struck the tines
in his face and beat him with it, fracturing his skull.
This is not the first deadly assault led or committed by
this fellow. He was arrested a few days ago while lead
ing an attack on a defenseless and unoffending citizen.
It was proved that he carried as a deadly weapon a
piece of gas p'PC- When brought to trial he was ac
quitted. As a result of that acquittal we have the assault
of Sunday and probably the death of its victim-
Police magistrates and the law officers of this city
may as well understand now as later on that the people
of San Francisco demand that this lawlessness and
murder cease. The day has gone by when personal as
saults and mob murder are to be overlooked because they
occur in a labor dispute and are punished when they
occur in some other kind of dispute. Men have the right
to work and the right to quit work. No man has the
right to compel another to quit work by murdering him
if he refuse. Business men have the right to peacefully
transact their business with their peace undisturbed by
insults addressed cither to them or their patrons. These
r<ghts are primordial.
Much excitement lias been caused here by the propo
sition to prohibit public meetings on the streets on the
ground that they impair the use of the public thorough
fare. Those who demand the right to use the streets for
meeting put their demand on the ground of free speech.
The right to peaceably use the streets while engaged
in a peaceable industry is just as sacred as the right of
free speech and is more important. Those who want to
speak can resort to a hall. An American laboring man
cannot hire a hall in which to earn his living or in which
to travel to and from his work- The unobstructed use
of the streets for such purposes is his imprescriptible
right, and a Government that will not protect him in it
is unworthy his allegiance.
All that the people of San Francisco ask is the en
forcement of the law against all who violate it and that
those who have sworn to enforce it be impeached if
they continue to encourage violence and mob murder.
VIOLENCE MUST STOP.
D. H. Burnham, the distinguished architect, who has
been giving us visions of sweetness and light in town
beauty, has accepted the task of submitting a compre
hensive plan for the adornment of San Francisco. Let us
hope that charity and good will .will possess him and that
in necessity he may not suggest that we move out, tear
down and begin all over again under the inspiration of
reason and common sense in civic architecture.

it "demeaning" himself to prosecute a

The Russian servants will talk about
fellow-servants, but never about their
employers. Even when they quit one
place and take service in another fam
ily they never * mention anything
about their former masters. This dis
cretion goes so far that even the law
considers it. In Russia the law ex

not suspected of having taken part in
the crime.â London Mail.

Pay for tlve Solons.
It says much for the unselfish pa
triotism of the Briton that he is the
only man in the world who is willing
to put his hand into his pocket and
pay on an average something like Â£500
a year, counting his election expenses,
for the privilege of giving his time
and labor to the making of his coun
try's laws; and one cannot wonder
that now and then a member of Par
liament, when he sees how. differently
things are arranged in other countries,
is anxlouB to have matters put on a
different footing.
The American lawmaker^ so far from
allowing his patriotism to deplete his
purse, thinks that he has well earned
the Â£1000 a year \yhich Congress pays
him for his legislative services; and
when this little income is supplemented
by manv convenient perquisites, such
as an allowance of Â£2 odd for station
ery and a dollar for every five miles
of traveling, he pockets his pride and
accepts them as only his fair due. The
French Deputy does not fare quite so
well; but at any rate he can always
rely on drawing his 625 francs a month
for his Parliamentary services, and he
never thinks of paying his own travel
ing expenses to and from Paris.
The colonies are so far from follow
ing the maternal example of making
their legislators pay for the privilege
of working, that In Victoria and New
South Wales each member of the Leg
islature receives an income of Â£300 a
year. South Australia pays her M. P.'s
a hundred a year less, and Queensland
an annual Â£150, to which Is added a
right to travel anywhere in the whole
continent of Australia free of cost. The
Canadian Senate and House of Com
mons alike pay their members a sal
ary of Â£200 a year, and 5d for every
mile they travel to and from Ottawa.
The members of the Legislative As
sembly of Quebec receive Â£200 a year
each, of Ontario Â£120, Nova Scotia
Â£100, Manitoba Â£110, British Columbia
Â£8ft. and New Brunswick as little as
Â£60. It cannot be said that such pay
monts err on the side of extravagance,
but thev are at any rate some recog
nition of good services ungrudgingly
rendered. In the Legislative Assembly
of Cape Colony a sliding scale is ob
served, the average remuneration of
members being about a guinea for each
day of attendance, with an extra al
lowance for traveling to members who
live some distance from Cape Town.
Norway looks after her legislators
with almost maternal solicitude. If
they fall ill she provides a doctor to
attend to them; she keeps them in
health by providing baths and a gymna
sium for their use, and even retains a
dentist to stop or extract a troublesome
molar. In addition to all these small
attentions she pays them a little more
than the equivalent of ll v shillings a
day for every day they devote to her
service, and not only pays their railway
fares, but allows them a daily 11 shill
ings for traveling and subsistence. It
is little wonder that legislation is pop
ular in the land of the Norsemen. Swe
den, however, is not nearly as consid
erate a mother, for she does not insult
her "House of Lords" by offering any
payment for its sen-ices, and she thinks
the equivalent of 6 shillings a day am
ple for each member of the lower
chamber: and if he is inconsiderate
enough to absent himself she fines him
nearly double the amount of his day's
wages. Denmark, not content with pay
ing her legislators a lawyer's fee of
six and eightpenee a day. together with
actual out-of-pocket expenses when
traveling, provides them with a free
seat at the Theater Royal whenever
they seek relaxation from work â an ex
ample which other countries might per
haps do well to follow.
Germany does not place a very high
value on the labors of her men of Par
liament, but if she pays them salaries
at which an average city elerk might
turn up his nose, she does not ask them
to pay a pfennig for their traveling,
whether on pleasure or duty bent. The
German legislative salaries range from
7 shillings a day in Saxe-Coburg to a
daily 12 shillings in Baden; but to this
small emolument must be abided free
traveling in Baden, and second-class
fares and three shillings a day for
"sundries" in Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.
The Bavarian M. P. who does not live
in Munich receives 10 shillings a day
for his attendance, with, as nearly as
possible, tenpence a mile for his travel
ing. Hungary looks after her legislators
of the lower house, who number 453, to
the extent of paying them Â£200 a year
and allowing them to travel at cheap
rates, while, as a crowning considera
tion, che allows each member nearly
Â£70 a year for house rent.â The Hour

A Morning Comedy.
Those belated individuals who are
on the streets in the wee sma* hours of
the morning have ears attuned to the
milk wagon's rattle and the rumble of
the vegetable wagons coming in from
the wilds of Ocean View and Colma.
Every dawning there comes down
Market street a long line of these
creaking vans of hardy cabbages, fes
tive radishes and delicate squashes
for the delectation of sleeping San
Francisco. At Montgomery street
they turn and pass down to the mar
kets along "Washington and Sansome
streets. So accustomed have the
horses become to the way that the^
drivers have only to give them their*
heads and then they sleep all the way
from the truck gardens over back of
the hills down to the stalls where they
unload.
Not many mornings ago when the
rumble of the presses told that the
weary newspaper men were released
for the night a little party of them
were crossing Market street, when
their way was blocked by the proces
sion of vegetable wagons, one behind
the'other. The drivers were all nod
ding on their seats and the foremost
team was leading the way for the
caravan. One of the irresponsible
newspaper scribes gravely stepped to
the heads of the first team, seized
their bridles, and, giving them a wide
turn, set their faces back up Market
OAKLAND, Berkeley and Alameda have enthusi
'astically and appropriately celebrated the arrival
of a train at the Oakland terminus of the Santa
Fe line. Remotely the event now celebrated took form
when the San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Rail
road was organized, began work on its line between
Stockton and Bakersfield, and put in what far-seeing
men understood would be one day a link in a transcon
tinental system.
That road, in its original ownership, was projected
from Stockton to San Francisco Bay, finding a terminal
on deep water at Point Richmond, where ship and car
come together and where already an important and per
manent population has Been planted, thriving upon the
activities that have been brought into being by trans
portation facilities. But in Berkelej-, Oakland and Ala
meda is a population of 125,000, to be served by an Oak
land terminal, especially for passenger business.
It was evident that after acquiring the San Francisco
and San Joaquin Valley line the Santa Fe could not long
overlook that large and growing population. Therefore
only the expected has happened in the opening of the
new terminal. By it Point Richmond becomes a suburb
of Oakland, tributary to its commerce and the adopted
child of its enterprise.
Seen from the bay there is a continuous city from
Berkeley to Alameda. Looking upon it one feels that
the aspiration of Mayor Olney for embracing it all in one
city and county organization is soon to be realized. Such
a population under one government and governed wisely
will soon show on that side of the bay a great city, not
the rival but the companion of San Francisco, with a
combined energy and enterprise capable of- the greatest
achievements. More than that, it needs no clairvoyance
to see Point Richmond extending southward until there
is a contact population from the point 'clear to Alameda.
These desirable steps forward come as the legitimate
result of new transportation facilities, under which use
and benefit expand. It is capable of proof that the com
ing of the Santa Fe from Bakersfield north has not
abridged the business of the Southern Pacific. It simply
created new business, so that both lines are taxed to
their capacity. This development is due entirely to the
new line, and should teach the people the stimulating
elfect of new facilities. The old arc not crippled nor in
jured, but the community is thrilled by a mighty im
pulse under which actually new additions are made to its
producing and consuming power.
Probably Oakland was the most obdurate of all com
munities to the reception of this great commercial truth.
It had the habit of opposition to railroads, arising in his
toric antagonism to the Central Pacific. Whatever
ground that opposition had was fancifully expanded by
politicians until the people settled down to the convic
tion that the Central Pacific had them shut in, that an
other line was impossible, and all they could do was
fight like spiders in a bottle. Of course there was no
validity in this view. Any line could condemn a right of
way across the Central Pacific track as readily as across
any other property, and the plain duty of the city for
protective purposes was to withdraw its energies from
lighting the road it had into securing another. But the
habit of opposition was so fixed that when Senator Fair
sought an outlet from his Fourteenth-street terminus, in
order to do with his narrow gauge line just what is now
accomplished through the San Francisco and San Joa
quin Valley line, Oakland hammered him to a standstill
and compelled him in despair to sell out to the Southern
Pacific.
All this is changed now. We refer to it at all only by
comparison to mark the high change that has come over
the east side of the bay. The railroad the people fought
so long is now at peace with them â a real peace, not an
armed truce. The new one that has come to them in
spite of the old and evil traditions which so long in
fluenced them against their own progress, is in touch with
every interest of the three cities concerned, and they
have made a holiday to give it jocund welcome
and a glad greeting. It is a new start from
a new base line entirely. In no part .of the
United States is an event as significant scored for
the opening year. Around this bay is destined to be
planted the most dense and enterprising and prosperous
population to be found on the planet. All that is needed
is to fellowship the factors that make it possible to real
ize all that is in the physical conditions and the commer
cial geography of the location.
Enterprise will ceaselessly act and react upon and be
tween the east and west sides of the bay. Their devel
opment will call for more facilities, more ferries, more
railroads, until in a future that is even now carmining the
horizon it will seem like one vast assemblage of busy
people. The ferries will be merely the extension of busi
ness streets, and there will be a panorama of homes and
manufactories and business buildings the most alluring

A picturesque scene was enacted on
the campus this morning, when the
members of the senior class made their
"pilgrimage" to all the college halls to
bid good-by after an acquaintance of |
four undergraduate years. The mem- j
bers of the graduating class, some 300 '
in number â the men in their battered i
senior plugs and duck trousers, and the j
women with red parasols and snowy |
white dressesâ made the slow circuit of
the campus, stopping long enough at
each of the buildings to listen to one
of their number say the last .word in
behalf of the department which the
building represented. /
One new feature was added to the
pilgrimage, of this year, and that was
the unveiling of the bronze tablet to the
memory of Professors Joseph and John
Le Conte. . The ceremony took place
under the shade of the venerable Le
Conte oak on the lower campus. On
this day six years ago the tablet was ]
placed in the fork of the oak by the
class of '9S as a mark of respect. With
in the last few months it was found
that the tablet placed in the tree was
endangering Its life, and it was decided
to place it on a granite pedestal along
side the <J?kkl A brief dedication speech
was made by Richard O'Connor, a
member of the graduating class.
Scott Hendrlcks, president of the se
nior class, was the first speaker of the
pilgrimage. He devoted his remarks to
a discussion of college loyalty and the
matter of permanently organizing the
class. His forceful remarks were re
ceived with enthusiasm. Max Thelen
was the speaker at South Hall and J.
E. Roadhouse at the agricultural build-
Ing. MIbs Tallulah Le Conte, in behalf
of her classmates, bade gqod-by to

building Fletcher Hamilton made a
short speech: The pilgrimage closed at

of the lasting quality of the friendships
formed at college, and especially on

WASHINGTON, May 16.â The second
quarterly report of Professor William
Alexander Sutherland, in charge of the
Filipino students in the United States,
has been received by the Bureau of In
sular Affairs of the War Department.
Professor Sutherland speaks of the ex
cellent health of the students who
spent their first winter in Southern
California, and also of the satisfactory
progress made in their school work.
i The present plan is to collect the stu
dents at some suitable place after the
school year is over and glvÂ«' them a
special summer course along the lines
where special work is needed, and then,
after a short visit to the St. Louis
Fair, to place them in schools and col
leges In the Central States.
The students, as far as they have ex
pressed themselves, desire to pursue a
variety of callings upon their return to
their island homes. One-quarter of
them expect to become teachers. Some
desire to be civil englners, others de
sire to pursue a commercial course, a
few wish to study medicine, two are
eager to enter the Naval Academy at
Annapolis and then find employment in
the coastwise service of the Philip
pines.
A few desire to study scientific agri
culture and it is suggested that they
be placed in some Southern agricul
tural college in order, to secure practi
cal training in the cultivation of rice,
sugar and cotton, as well as acquaint
ance with modern agricultural instru
ments. V

BERKELEY, Mav 16.â There was
recompense for four years of toil for
the graduating class of the University
of California this afternoon. It came
in the joy and frolic of an extravagant
extravaganza that called out the his
tronlc talent of th,e whole senior class.
In "Anyman Can't Graduate" two stu
dent authors crowded together the
humors and tragedies of a year, par
odying all of them. They dipped into
the' grim tale of "Everyman" and they
stole the thunder of '"The Birds of
Aristophanes." Even the classic
"Phedre" searched for her wad' of
gum beneath the plush of her throne.
The faculty suffered, too, for its sins.
Professors Bernard Moses and Charles
Mills Gayley, the co-ed haters, and
Recorder Sutton, the iconoclast of the
university, met deserving fates.
Of "Anyman," the authors of the ex
travaganza, Carleton H. Parker apd
Arthur L. Price, found a youth who
could really graduate from the country
school. His fellows who dreamed of
other things . wanted to graduate, too,
but Recorder Sutton was there and he
wouldn't let them. Thus "Anyman"
incurs the ill-will of the unfortunate
ones and "Death" condemns him to
the grave. The kindly offices of Miss
California save him, however, at the
critical moment and his life is saved,
though he can't graduate.
"Death," in the person of Philip
Carey, carried a shudder to everybody
in the audience. Fletqher Hamilton,
as Anyman, was at first defiance and
then penitence personified. Carleton
Parker and Miss Tallulah Le Conte as
the "Bad Boy" and the "Bad Girl,"
were as mischievous as the offspring
of the famous Mr. Peck. Miss Edu
arda Howard, as Miss California,
looked fetching in a gown of blue and
gold and led a chorus of pretty girls
representing California poppies. Paul
Ligda's Recorder Sutton might not
have been told apart from the original
Recorder Sutton, so faithful was the
impersonation.
CAST AXD CHORUSES.
All of yesterday's session of the Unit
ed States District Qourt was taken up
by W. H. H. Hart and A. R. Cotton,
attorneys for George W. Rumble, in
attempting to show that the Old Glory
mine, in Butte County, had produced
sufficient gold under Rumble's manage
ment to pay 2 per cent monthly divi
dends to the . numerous stockholders
east of the Rocky Mountains.
Ira Pease,, president of the Sunset
Mining Company, said he had been
present at numerous weekly "clean
ups" in the Old Glory and that
he had seen aa many r.s 300 ounces of
gold taken from the sluice boxes at one
time. The smallest weekly output of
gf-ld that hÂ«- could remember was four
teen cr fifteen ounces, and such small
clean-ups were not frequent.
Henry Gutches and John Bull Jr.,
New York brokers, who had sold sev
eral thousand shares of stock for Rum
ble on commission, swore that the for
mer had seen a clean-up of $3050 and
Mr. Bull a clean-up of ninety-six
ounces, Mr. Rumble being present at
both golden accouchements.
Hart A. Hardinge, a legal luminary
from Los Gatos. told how he had been
introduced by Rumble in March or
April of last year to "a Mr. Chapman,"
who was cashier of the fake Alliance
Bank of Rumble's, and who has never
been seen or heard, of since.
Several Old Glory miners, employes
of Rumble, testified that it was no un
common event to pick up nuggets val
ued at $25 or $30 each. '
Ben L. McKinley. counsel for the
prosecution, will ask Judge de Haven
this morning to require Rumble to fur
nish new bonds. The prosecution has
learned that the Union, Surety and
Guaranty Company of Philadelphia,
which furnished the $3000 bond for
Rumble, has been adjudged a bank
rupt.

It has long been the custom of the
club to annually bestow upon a chosen
member of the California or Stanford
university a scholarship in Harvard,
and following this precedent those
present at last evening's affair con
ferred this honor on Student Blanchard
of Berkeley, he having received the
unanimous indorsement of the faculty
of that institution. "Last year a stu
dent of Stanford was the fortunate re
cipient of the scholarship.
part it takes in the affairs of the coun
try.
â¢Professor James Barr Ames, dean of
the Harvard Law School, who came to
the coast several days ago for the pur
pose of delivering a lecture at Stanford
University, was a guest of honor at the
quarterly dinner of the Harvard Club
last evening, given at Delraonico's.
T*he function was attended by about
six&y former graduates of Harvard, In
cluding several of the Federal and
Stable judiciary, prominent members of
the. bar and medical professions, repre
sentatives cf the faculties of the Cali
fornia and Stanford universities.
An incident of the gathering most
pleasing to Professor Ames was the
fact that seated near him at the dinner
v.iyo throe graduates of the first class
he taught at Harvard, John B. Carson,
Jesse W. Lilienthal end William
Thomaa. eminent in the legal profes
sion of this city. Fairfax H. Whelan,
president cf the club, acted as toast
mister of the occasion, of which the
principal speakers were Professor
Ames, Dr. E. R. Taylor, Judge Hunt,
John McNaught, Judge Sloss and
Judge Davis. The general theme of the
speakers was the university and the
teachers who have had from one to
four years' experience. In other
words, all teachers who have had such
experience, whether it be one or four
years, will begin to earn $60 from the
date of their appointment.
The graduated increase will begin
after one year's service in the depart
ment, when $2 50 additional will be
allowed. An ascending Bcale will then
be granted until the teachers of pri
mary grades will have received a
maximum of $76 and those of gram
mar grades $83 per month. It will
take eight years for a teacher to reach
the maximum salary under the revised
schedule.
The board ascertained that It will
require about $7000 yearly to put the
change into effect and some 300 teach
ers will be affected at once thereby.
The board to-day will inspect and
adopt the plans for the enlargement
of the Dudley Stone and Richmond
schools. The plans were prepared by
the Board of Public Works.

The Board of Public Worka again
met the Finance Committee of the
Board of Supervisors yesterday morn
ing for the purpose of explaining the
Board of Works' financial necessities
for the following year.
Schmitz and the rest of the board
showed no bashfulness In asking for
what they wanted, but when the fig
ures became too high Supervisor
Brandenstein objected.
"You shouldn't ask for what you
think we can give you or what you
think we can afford to give," he said;
"you should ask -for what you' need
and then we can cut the cloth accord
ingly.
Supervisor d'Ancona suggested the
advisability of extending Market street
through the Twin Peaks and on to the
ocean beach,' but when Michael Casey
and others explained that the prelim
inary plans and specifications for work
would cost in the neighborhood of $5000
the subject was dropped.
Schmitz explained that much more
money Is needed than Is deemed suf
ficient by the Finance Committee. He
explained that while Brandenstein is
figuring on the bond issue going
through, there are manv streets not
included therein that are in need of
immediate repairs. In the course of
the investigation the subject of civil
service was brought up. Schmitz said
that although the Merchants' Asso
ciation of this city recently adopted a
resolution / to the effect that all tjie
street sweeping be done by the city,
arid that none but civil service men
be employed to do the work, such a
method would be impracticable. He
claims that In most departments of the
civil service lists the men are far too
old to do the work arid that in the,
street sweeping department the eli
gible list consists of. men from 70 to 80
years of age.
WOULD FIX AGE LEHIT.
Brandenstein expressed his Inability
to see why there should not be an age
limit fixed bv the Civil Service Com
missioners and promised that he would
bring the question up before them
when they appear before the Finance
Committee to-morrow morning.
The Board of Public Works asked
that an appropriation of $38,000 be made
to be expended on the City Hall and
the Hall of Justice.
Mrs. W. F. " Merrill appeared before
the Finance Committee yesterday
morning on behalf of the San Francisco
Benevolent Association asking that an
appropriation be set aside for the asso
ciation. Mrs. Merrill averred that there
are thousands of worthy ' poor In . the
city who are not looked after bv other
societies, and that $5000 could be put to
good use for their welfare.
CHARTER BARS CHARITIES.
Brandenstein explained that the char
ter adopted a year ago prevents the
granting of her request, as it positively
states that no city money shall be
given to charities other than municipal
organizations.
Mrs. Merrill next asked that the City
and County Hospital's appropriation of
last year shall not be decreased this
year, as all the money possible is need
ed in giving proper treatment to the in
mates. The matter was assigned to Dr.
d'Ancona, who will make an investiga
tion. *
Miss Katherine Felton appeared be
fore the committee to suggest the
maintenance of a detention ward for
children awaiting trials in the Juvenile
court. She says that a piece of prop
erty three blocks from the City Hall

wife placed in charge at the expense of
but $3500 to the city per annum. The
matter will be Investigated by the
board.

The Board of Supervisors yesterday
Indefinitely postponed the proposed or
dinance for regulating meetings on the
public streets. Many protests were filed
In which vigorous objection was made
to the restriction of free speech, and
the board took a similar point of view.
Supervisor Brandenstein explained
that the ordinance had not been rec
ommended by Chief of Police Witt
man, as commonly believed, but had
been Introduced at the request of
Grant-avenue retail merchants, who
Â¦were entitled to relief from the meet
ings held nightly on the thoroughfare,
and he suggested that eome regulation
thereon be adopted.
A resolution was adopted granting
J..P. Fraser, chairman of the commit

etreet, from California to Market;

The City Attorney was directed to
dismiss an action instituted by the
Board of Works against Charles and
Harry Bush to compel the removal of
Fteps projecting over the sidewalk at
Eddy and Franklin streets, as the per
mission to erect the steps was regu
larly granted by the board on April 2,
1900.
The Police Commissioners petitioned
the board to appropriate $500 to defray
the expenses of Chief Wittman, who
vas recently granted a leave of ab
sence to attend the conference of
Chiefs of Police to be held in St. Louis
at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition,
on June 6. The petition recites that as
"Wittman is making the trip solely in
the public Interest It would not be im
rroper for the city to defray the cost of
the Journey." The conference is to be
an international affair and will have a
most important bearing on police mat
ters. The petition was referred to the
Finance Committee.
The flg*t between Police Commis
sioner Hutton to obtain a legal mods
of entering the premises at 1129 Du
pont street and Attorney George D.
Collins, representing Jean Pon, to
prevent it. goes on with unfailing reg
ularity and becomes more and more
complicated.
Hutton and Chief Wiitman were cited
to appear before Judge Cook yesterday
for an alleged violation of the injunc
tion restraining the police from inter
fering with Pon's restaurant business
in procuring from Police Judge Ca
baniss warrants for the arrest of
forty-two inmates of the premises in
the rear of the restaurant on a mis
demeanor charge.
INTERPOSE DEMURRERS.
When the case was called demur
rers were Interposed on behalf of Hut
ton and Wittman. They deny the alle
gations In the affidavit of Pon. It
was argued by Attorney Monroe and
Assistant District Attorney Harris that
as no overt act was charged against
the respondents they could not be ac
cused of violating the injunction. The
mere fact of , procuring warrants
could not constitute an overt act.
Collins argued that the warrants
were not to be used for the purpose
of arresting the women, but only as a. j
subterfuge to obtain an entry to the
premises and ruin the business of the j
petitioner. He contended that there j
was a violation of the injunction.
The Judge said that there was such
a thins as a threatened violation of
an injunction and if so it was within
the province of the court to 1 issue an
other restraining order. It seemed to
him that no step had been taken to
carry the threat into execution. He
wanted to know whether there had
been anything more than a threat.
If the petitioner had no authorities to
combat the point raised by the re
spondents he would consider it well
taken. He continued the case until
Friday to give both sides time to sub
mit authorities.
PROCEEDINGS DISMISSED.
The contempt proceedings against
Policemen Davids and Barry for vio
lating the Injunction in arresting Beu
lah Williams after she had left the
restaurant were dismissed without
prejudice. Collins Insinuated that the
police were keeping, the woman out of
the way. This was denied by Asslst
! ant District Attorney Harris, who ex
| pressed his anxiety to hear her tes
timony. The habeas corpus proceed
ings for the felease of Rosle Smith,
charged with vagrancy, and Rosie
Miller, charged with perjury, were
continued till May 23.
Commissioner Hutton brought up
the question of the writ of certiorari
which had been assigned by Presiding
Judge Kerrigan to Judge Sloss* court
and Judge Cook said he would bow
I to the opinion of the presiding Judge.
I Collins argued that Judge Cook was
j within his rights in making the writ
returnable to his own court and said
I he had authorities to the point. It
I was affreed that the matter in dispute
i should be argued before Judge Sloss
j this morning.
The board Dassed to print an ordin
ance granting the Southern Pacific
Company the right to construct twen
ty-seven spur tracks near the county

pany agrees to keep the roadways in
good repair.
The Outdoor Art League called the
attention of the board In a communi
cation to the fact that city ordin
ance No. 1081. limiting the height of

streets. The league petitions that the
board cause the ordinance to be en
forced.
The Board of "Works recommended
that Kearny street between California
and Clay be bituminized at an estimat
ed cost of $5300.
The petitioners claim that the traffic
has been diverted from Geary street
to the detriment of business thereon
and 'the Geary Street Company can not
be expected to modernize Its road so as
to meet the demands of travel owing
to the fact that Its franchise ha3 ex
pired. The petition was referred to the
Public Utilities Committee.
The Point Lobos Improvement -Club
and Progressive Geary Street Improve
ment Club Jointly petitioned the Board
of Supervisors yesterday that steps be
taken to award a new franchise to the
highest bidder for the operation of the
Geary street and Point Loboa avenue
roads.
The petition states that the proposi
tion for the city to acquire the road
has been twice submitted to the peo
ple and has been both times defeated,
thus demonstrating that the people do
not care to operate a road on these
streets in the name of the municipal
ity.

Despondent by reason of illness. Mrs.
Gus Clark of 220 Fell street attempted
her life last evening by swallowing the
contents of a bottle containing lysol,
and it was only due to the skill and
hard work of Dr. Rueben Chandler Hill

"We are filling vacancies as rapidly as

strike is purely a sympathetic one, al
though it is said by those implicated
in " it that it is not. Reports from

In the revision committee this after
noon an effort was made to abrogate
certain rules relating to the personal
conduct of ministerial and lay mem
bers which were originally promulgat
ed by John Wesley and have been a
part of the church discipline ever since.
It was urged that the church had out
grown these rules and that they were
not applicable to modern times. The
proposition was voted down, however,
by the committee on the ground that
they should be retained for the proper
guidance of and good example for un
christianized peoples.

1 REV JAMES ROSCOE DAT. WHO
| PROBABLY WILL, BE CHOSEN
' BISHOP.
J The committee on itineracy, by a
vote of 63 to 50 this afternoon decided
against recommending .any change in
the pastoral time . limit and the com
mittee report will be presented to the
conference to-morrow morning. A mi
nority report which will be submitted
as an amendment to the majority re
port will recommend the restoration
of the five year limit with a special
proviso tqr exceptional cases. In which
It Is stipulated that a Bishop may
In reference to the report that the
Methodist ministers of Philadelphia had
protested against the retirement of
Bishop Foss, an authority high in the
councils of the present conference
stated that such protest could not be
considered, as the rules of the confer
ence did not permit of a consideration
of the vote on the matter. Bishop Foss
when seen would not discuss the sub
ject. "There is no doubt, however," he
stated, "about my retirement. The vote
of the conference last Saturday was 500
in favor of my being placed on the su
perannuated list."
In connection with the retirement of
the five Bishops the conference this
morning passed a resolution presented
by Dr. G. H. Forbes of Minneapolis,
Minn., providing for six months' full
pay for the Bishops from the date of
their retirement. The regular annual
salary pt an active Bishop In the
Methodist church is $5000, while each
retired Bishop receives $2500 a year
during lifetime.
The amusement question also came
up for further discussion at this morn-
Ing's session. Dr. Elliott of Detroit
presented a resolution setting forth
that there was a doubt in the minds
of many of the delegates as to the
constitutionality of paragraph 258 of
the discipline, and asking that the
matter be referred to the judiciary
committee for a report upon the sub
ject. After considerable debate, in
which the charge of unconstitutionality
against the amusement clause was
characterized bv Dr. J. M. Buckley,
Judge C. Z. Lincoln of New York and
others as an attempt to sidetrack the
question to avoid a direct vote on its
merits, the resolution was voted down.
PASTORAL LIMIT UNCHANGED.
LOS ANGELES, May 16.â Contrary to
expectations, the result of the secret
ballot taken last Saturday by the
Methodist General Conference on the
subject of the retirement of Bishops
Andrews. Mallalieu. Vincent, Walden
and Foss was not made public at to
day's session of the conference. Instead
the result was ordered to be announced
by publication in to-morrow morning's
Issue of the Christian Advocate, the
official organ of the conference. There
is no doubt, however, according to the
most reliable authority, that all of the
five Bishops have been retired by the
vote of an overwhelming majority of
the delegates.
From the following list of Methodist
leaders the eight new American Bish
ops will be chosen. It is almost safe
to positively assert that the first eight
named will be made Bishops on
Wednesday morning, when the elec
tions will be held:
Dr. W. F. McDowell, secretary of the
board of education.
Dr. J. F. Berry, editor of the Epworth
Herald.
Dr. Henry Spellmeyer, the Newark
preacher.
Dr. J. R. Day, chancellor of Syracuse
University.
Dr. J. W. Bashford, president of Ohio
Wesleyan Seminary.
Dr. G. F. Bovard, president of the
University of Southern California.
Dr. H. C. Jennings, agent of the West
ern Book Concern.
Dr. George P. Eckman, the New York
pastor.
Dr. David G. Downey, the Brooklyn
pastor. /
Dr. J. W. E. Bowen, the colored.edu
cator of Atlanta, Ga
it is thought that a constitutional
provision will prevent the election of a
colored Bishop, otherwise Dr. Bowen
would be quite sure to win.

TACOMA, Wash., May 16.â At Rose

of burning pitch over his six-year-old
David. The child was dreadfully
burned and died while being brought
this morning to a hospital in Tacoma.
David noticed that the pitch in the
can had taken fire while boiling on the
kitchen stove. His father told the boy
to leave the house while he placed the
two-year-old baby in the wood box for
safety. Seizing: a wet cloth Mclntyre
lifted the can to throw it into the yard.
David was opening a small gate lead
ing off the porch when his father ex
citedly threw the contents of the can
into the air. The burning pitch came
down over the boy, searing his face
and legs and setting his clothing on
fire.
Mclntyre ran after the agonized
child and brushed out the fire on his
clothing with his hands. The usual
remedies for burns were applied to the
l<ttle fellow and a local physician at
tended him. Almost completely cov- 1
ered with bandages he was this morn
ing driven four miles to Big Harbor,
where a steamer was taken for Ta
coma. On reaching the hospital it was
found that the little sufferer was dead.

vehicles were passing along and the
passengers assisted the unfortunates.
Mrs. Sawyer was badly cut about the

SPOKANE, May 16. â Eight prison
ers in the county jails at North Ya
kima and Ellensburg. Wash., made
their way to liberty last night and
officers believe the affair was planned
Jointly.
The counties adjoin, though the
cities are eighty miles apart. Officers
of both counties always extend help
to their neighbors in running down
prisoners, and for this reason it is
believed the escape was Jointly
planned.
From the North Yakima jail four
men got out by digging through a
brick wall, two men confined in a
dark cell making a hole, securing an
ax and returning to break the Iock3
on the cells and liberate two pals.
Two of the gang are alleged highway
robbers.
With a piece of gasplpe four Ellens
burg prisoners dug through a brick
wall into the pounty vault. They un
screwed the lock with a knife blade,
walked into the County Treasurer's
office and were easily at liberty. But
the escape was soon discovered and a
posse rounded up the four men. The
Â¦North Yakima escapes are still at
large.

MAJOn GEORGE D. WORSWICK OF
SAX JOSE WHO HAS BEEN RE
ELECTED BY LARGE MAJORITY.
Clerk's office in three minutes after the
polls closed, and then nearly every min
ute thereafter at Millard's bulletin
board complete returns of precincts
were posted three minutes after the
polls closed.
Many voters lost their votes by not
knowing how to manipulate the ma
chines. There was a smaller vote to
day than in 1902, and it is believed it
was caused by many of the old voters
staying away, as they were afraid they
could not master the machines.
To-night; the Worswick followers are
parading the streets several hundred
strong with a brass band, and are
cheering over their victory. Mayor
Worswick was serenaded at his home
and he addressed the multitude.
The vote cast for the head of the
ticket to-day was 429S. Two years ago
it was 4700.

SAN JOSE, May 16. â Mayor George
D. Worswick and the administration
ticket; with the exception of City Clerk
Bellolli, were re-elected to-day. The
opposition's only successful candidate
is Roy. Walter, a newspaper man, and
he had but a narrow margin of eight
votes. Worswick's majority is 364.
H. D. Matthews is elected Treasurer
by G57 votes jind John F. Carey Coun
cilman in Second "Ward by 369 and W.
L.^Pieper Councilman in the Third
Ward by 686 votes. The vote was as
follows: Mayor â George D. Wors

Carey 2295; Councilman Third Ward
â Wesley L. Pieper 2421, D. J. Me-
Ginley 1725.
The issue was the old fight between
the Hayes and Mackenzne factions and
the Hayes faction scored a victory.
Two years ago the Hayes wing scored
their first victory, when they elected
their entire ticket with the exception
of City Treasurer. Since then they
have had full control of the city gov
ernment. Two months ago they se
cured the Treasurer's office through
a defalcation of City Treasurer Mc-
Geoghegari.
Deprived of all city patronage, John
D. Mackenzie has been at work build-
Ing up his machine for the past two
years. To-day's result showed that he
has been able to keep his forces well
In line, but. was unable to make gains
from the other side sufficient to carry
the city. The Hayes people made their
campaign on , Worswick's record for
the last' two years through their two
daily papers.
Last evening three arrests for illegal
registration were made and to-day a
man named Lawrence was arrested for
illegal voting at the request of Police
Commissioner McCarthy. C. D. Acree.
who was one of those arrested last
night, was arrested again to-day on a
bench warrant Issued from Justice Ben
son's court. He was released last night
on bail and failed to show up In court
this morning.
Both . factions worked hard at the
polls to-day. r The Worswick ticket had
the most active workers, but the Mac
kenzieites were not idle. The Harbor
Commissioner was about the city di
recting the fight in the various pre
cincts.
San Jose used the voting machines
for the" first- time to-day. These at
tracted: a great, deal' of attention, not
only here but N from about the State.
This is the first time the machines
have been used in any large city of
the "West. â¢ Election Commissioners
Voorsanger, and Roberts of San Fran
cisco were present, as was also Frank
H. Jordan, Clerk of the Supreme Court
and the State representative of the
United States Standard Voting Ma
chines. The voting machines were a
success. Within fifteen minutes after
the polls were closed the result of the
vote in all the precincts was known in
the City Hall," with the , exception of
one precinct. This one was the Ninth,
and: there the election officials did not
know how to open the back of the ma
chine. This return was received thirty
minutes after the polls closed.

The ceremonies ended with the pre
sentation of a pennant to Captain Pay
son on behalf of the school children of
Berkeley. The presentation was made
by little Ernest Sadler, who was dress
ed as a Bailor in white duck. Master
Sadler was so overcome by the pres
ence of the* great personages around
him that he forgot his speech, but the
words of greeting on the streamer
were a sufficient message. The words
were: "School, children's greetings,
Berkeley, May 16, 1904."
In the meantime the band played Its
liveliest aira and "the 6Chool children
decorated- the engine and cars with
streamers of flowers. The streamers
were hung from the windows and
bunches of flowers were tied on the
guard and stanchions and wherever
there was a prong of any sort. The
depot had already been decorated with
flags and bunting and pennants and a
big blue and gold sign of welcome
hung over the tracks. Beneath this
the train passed when at last it pulled
out for Oakland.
"It was part of* my duty to ask of
you and the other members of the
Board of Trustees for the franchises
for the Santa Fe road a couple of years
ago and I assure you it is a pleasure
to be here to thank you now. You re
member we had some little discussion
then over the conditions of the fran
chises, but we have fulfilled our prom
ises and our relations I hope will al
ways be perfectly amicable.
"There is no doubt about the signifi
cance of this event. The placing of a
town of this size on a transcontinental
railway certainly is of great signifi
cance. Now you have the first com
peting transcontinental railroad in the
West. We will, I think, have your co
operation always. You cannot get
along without us very well and we
can not get along without you. I hope
that there shall be nothing In our fu
ture relations that will mar the mem
ory of the celebration that has marked
this occasion."
not behind Southern California in the
production of floral display. We trust,
sir, that this day will mark an epoch
in the history of Berkeley and wish
you all the success for the future."
Responding Captain Payson said that
he had never had any doubt about Ber
keley and these roses were sufficient
indication of the beauty of the town.
And then turning to Mr. Rickard he
said:
At Oakland a fiatcar had been deco
rated - for the use of the - reception
committee.. On this car were United
States, Senator George,; C. Perkins,
Mayor Warren Olney of Oakland, vari
ous members of the Oakland City
Council, the Alameda County j Board
of Supervisors, the Town ' Trustees of
Berkeley and '.President
H." C. Capwell of the Oakland Board
Oaklanders were determined to
make the day memorable in the his
tory of the town and they succeeded
beyond the expectations of the most
ardent "Booster."
There was a regular programme,
carried out with greater fidelity than is
usual with such events. The various
committeemen and Grand Marshal
Bates and his aids all seemed to feel
that they were working on railroad
time, and that while ordinary par
adesi might fail to start on time, when
they were working to meet an overland
train that was to arrive at a particular
moment they would have to be
prompt. And so it was that. when the
Santa Fe train swept around the curve
in front of the new depot on San
Pablo avenue the Oakland parade was
crossing the avenue and had to be
halted to give the train the right of
way.
There were two trains that reached
Oakland at the time set for the open
ing and the crowd * that gathered to.
give the welcome became confused.
The first train was the regular, known
on the timecards as. No. .41, and. in
order not to interfere with the reg
ular travel of the road, it was decided
to send this train through on ; schedule
time. A second train .was made up
and run as a special, carrying ex
cursionists from Martinez, Point Rich
mond and even as far as Stockton. On
the rear of this was the directors' car
of the Santa Fe Company, carrying all
of the general -officials of the. com
pany who were on the coast at the
time. This train made stops' at vari
ous places along the road .and ar
rived in Oakland shortly after 11
o'clock, where the big demonstration
was held.
X * FLATCAR FOR COMMITTEE.
Schools and stores were closed and
the people rejoiced. The music of
many bands filled the air with har
mony and flower-bedecked carriages
made the parade one of rare beauty.
Bicycles and automobiles were numer
ous and youth and beauty joined with
stern age to welcome the pioneer
Santa Fe train from New Orleans.
Bunting decorated 'buildings, flags
fluttered from poles and wires, and at
no town where the rails of the Santa
Fe system touch was ever such a royal
welcome given the first train that
came within its precincts. Even the
committees that arranged the event
were surprised at the outpouring and
the officials of the railroad were
stunned when they saw the crowds
that had gathered to do them honor.
The Santa Fe officials were the most
surprised of all and they repeatedly
said that had they known what Oak
land was doing by way of a welcome
they would have gone further than
they did to decorate the train.
OAKLAND, May 16. â Santa Fe day
will be remembered aa a holiday, even
though it is not marked on the calen
dars.
This is a day of great promise for Oakland.
The nrst train over a new transcontinental line
hat hardly come to a standstill, and yet we
are this early : tasting the frultsu of com
petltion-and may the cup never be drained.
H.C Capwell, president of the Oak
land Board of Trade, had this to' say:
I am glad to be here to-day, but I appear
only as a prosy. I came to tell you that the
Governor of this State, the Hon. George C.
Pardee your townsman, cannot attend because
of official duties that keep him at the Capitol.
But I am glad to tell you how much this roail
means to the people of the State .and the
people of Oakland. This is a great State.
There are to-day but nine people to each
square mil* of Its surface. We i could make
that ten times that number and still, give
every person a farm that -would support a
family I hardly believe . that cttiiens ap
preciate - the State'* resources. New sources
of wealth are being discovered each day and
our future Is practically unlimited. But
while we are thanking the people who made
this road possible we must remember the men
who did the work. . the engineers, firemen and
conductors who handle these great trains, and
to them I wish to lift my hat as a mark of
respect. :Â¦ ' . v
GOVERNOR'S PROXY SPEAKS.
United States Senator Gorge C.
Perkins spoke for Governor George C.
Pardee, who could not attend. The
Senator told them the Governor Was
detained, at Sacramento and. then
added his words of. welcome, saying:
The Santa Fe officials "boarded the
car, where the Oakland committee
stood ready to receive them, and were
Introduced by Edwin Stearns, secre
tary of; the Oakland Board of Trade.
M. J. Keller, treasurer of the Oakland
Board of Trade, had a few words to
say as chairman of the general com
mittee. He spoke briefly a welcome
to the new road and told how for
years Oakland had desired a compet
ing railroad. He then introduced
Mayor Warren Olney of Oakland, who
delivered the address of welcome on
behalf of the municipal communities
on this side of the bay, saying:
Oakland Is jclad to greet another trans
continental road, and extends to you, gentle
men as representing that road, the heartiest
of welcomes. Every man, woman and child in
Oakland Is glad to see you here. In the olden
times when men and nations were not so well
acquainted with one another." they fought and
battled as If they were wild animals. , If I
were asked to-day what was the greatest aid
to the civilization and uniting of humanity I.
would say in one word, railroads. With this
aid we are learning to know each other better.
Therefore, we of Oakland rejoice that another
transcontinental line has reaghed our limits.
We welcome you for the material benefit* you
bring. A single road Is better than none, but
two more than double the blessing. We have
never been so badly off here as were the people
of the south before you came, but we lock
for great good to Oakland because of your
coming.
of Trade, President A. Jonas of the
Oakland Merchants' Exchange and
committeemen from the different im
provement organizations of Oakland,

OAKLAND, May 16. â The proces
sion that -welcomed the first Santa Fe
train was characteristic of the city.
It was essentially a floral display. No
vehicle of any sort was allowed in the
parade that did not carry flowers as
Its special feature. Lilies, red roses,
geraniums and every flower -that
grows were lavishly used and the out
lines of the carriages were lost in
myriads of colored blooms.
The procession was directed by
Charles D. Bates Jr. as grand mar
shal, aided by J. W. Mathews, Ray
Baker, Oscar Luning, Harold Havens,
A. B. Fately, Dr. W. L. Dunn, Dr.
Shannon, Dr. W. J. Smytne, A. Gard,
Fred E. Blanchard and Joseph Ede

The division for single horse car
riages was two blocks long and con-,
tained many of the prettiest displays
in buggy decorating. . It was directed
by Marshal D. H. McLaughlin and
Aids Fred T. Delckmann and Charles
T. Pugh. Citizen vied with citizen to
make ordinary buggies pretty, and
some -unique effects were obtained.
Mrs. Dr. Mehrmann drove a carriage
completely covered with calla lilies
and greens. Several rigs of "boosters"
created enthusiasm by continued
cheering for Greater .Oakland. Fol
lowing is the list of carriages entered
in the procession: Henry A- Butter*

The officials were then lunched at
the clubhouse of the California Jockey
Club at the Oakland track.
At the time our franchises were granted I
was not able to promise a new ferry, but
this facility baa now been given to you. and
while I am adverse to prophecy, I fully be
lieve that the time will soon come Â¦ when the
cities on the cast side of the bay, from Ala
meda to Richmond, will ba linked into ona
great municipality.
Ladles and Gentlemen of Oakland: I wish
I were better fitted to eloquently reply to the
kind words that have been said. I wish now
to thank you for the generous manner in
which my company was treated at the time
our franchise was secured. 1 also wish to
thank the landowners for their liberality and
also the citizens who materially assisted us.
Captain A. H. Payson on behalf of
the officials of the Santa Fe replied to
the congratulations offered by the
citizens, saying:
Gentlemen of the Santa Fe, I wish to extend
to you a hearty greeting on behair of the
merchants. Not only has this new road linked
us more closely with the EaÂ«t. but It will
also assist in forming Richmond, Oakland,
Berkeley and Alameda into one grreat city.
And now, gentlemen, on behalf of the Oakland
Hoard of Trade and the 1GO.000 people who
live upon this slda of the bay, we bid you.
welcome â a welcome born of long desire and
exi>ectatlon.
A. Jonas, president of the Mer
chants' Exchange, had this to say:

and Mayor Olney Speaks for Oakland.
The fire started at 10:30 and the
caused is unknown, as there had not
been any fire in the building. The
value of the'building was $3000. The
total loss will amount to about $5000.
The foundry and smelting works of
the California Smelting Company, lo
cated at Fourth and Fallon streets,
were totally destroyed to-night by a
fire which started in the rear of the
building. The building had . been
erected by the Oakland Dock and
Warehouse Company and had just
been leased for five years to Harmon
& Wright, the proprietors of the Cal
ifornia Smelting Company. The build
ing was to have been used for the
manufacture of a composition metal
and the necessary machinery had just
been installed, but the plant had not
been put into operation.

J3ERKELEY. May 16.â The Santa Fe
train got its first welcome from Berke
ley. A big engine puffed into the little
Mission etation, dragging eight cars
behind It, and puffed away again with
the shouts of the populace ringing in
us ears. It came bare and colorless
and went clothed in garlands of flow
ers, set by the deft hands of a thou
hsand little school children. Words of
greeting were exchanged between the
newcomers and the official represen
tatives of the town and the first few
minutes of a new epoch had been
Btruck off.
The train drew into the station twen
ty minutes late, that is to say, it ar
rived at 10:00 o'clock instead of 10:30
o'clock, as schedule^ A local train
heralded the cfficialMxain and nearly
everybody mistook it for the other.
The passengers were regaled with
flowers by the school children until
they discovered that they were dec
orating the wrong outfit. The official
train announced itself a little later by
a long, screeching whistle that came
in half a mile ahead of the engine. It
betrayed itself by the puffs of white
and black smoke that shot up from
behind a hill in the distance. Then it
marched slowly into the station, with
the thundering airs of a giant and dis
dainful of the shouts of welcome from
a multitude, and came to a stop.
There was a pause and then Captain
Parson appeared upon the rear plat
form of the rear car. A shout went up
and the Santa Fe's official bowed. An
other pause and then Thomas Rickard,
President of the Board of Trustees,
arose in the decorated baggy he oc
cupied alongside the track to make the
Welcoming address. Mr. Hickard's
epeech was timely and to the point and
he said:
"We are come to congratulate you
upon the consummation of this great
achievement and to wish you prosper
ity. All Berkeley Joins in the welcom
ing and. well- wishing to the Santa Fe
Railroad. We are going to co-operate
with you in all your endeavors in the di
rection of improvement and thank you
again in anticipation of the benefits
that are to come to us."
Then, just to show one side of the
productiveness of Berkeley and her
possibilities, a big bunch of red roses
was presented to Captain Payson. The
presentation speech was made by Red
mond C. Staats of the Board of Trus
tees in behalf of two representative
women of Berkeley. Mr. Staats said:
Mr. Payson: "On behalf of Mrs. A.
G. Freeman and Mrs. A. J. Ralston of
Berkeley I present you with this bo
quet of roses. And we trust that it
will be an Indication that Berkeley is
After passing the Santa Fe depot

Â»of the organization; F. Bruzzone, secre
tary, and R. Brown, treasurer, rode in
the front rank.
There were several elaborately got up
floats to bring up the rear of the
floral parade. The Oakland Board of
Trade had a large wooden likeness of
a locomotive completely covered with
red roses. The Boosters' Club, more
than sixty strong, rode in a specially
constructed barge. During the proces
sion they cheered for greater Oakland.

covered with flowers that only i the

background on both side's. The men
who rode in the machine were. L.ud

Mr. and Mrs. W. F. Kelley of the

machine decorated with flags upon
which was inscribed, "Welcome, Santa
Fe."
As. soon as the case was called this
'. p.fternoon Attorney Charles E. Snook,
representing Howe, made objection to
the form of the affidavit, giving as his
reason thPt the charges were made by
a person who, so far as he knew, was
irresponsible and that if Rowe was
obliged to answer the charges under
the present action it left him -without
recauree against his accuser in case it
was .decided that the charges lacked
foundation and had been falsely and
yialiclously made,
â¢Twenty-seven separate charges of
overcharge were made, aggregating
$3S 50, and It was attempted to throw
Kwve out of office on these grounds.
The" Supervisor filed an answer in
â¢which each of these items was ex
plained, but under Judge Greene's rul
*ing the explanation was not necessary.
The accusation brought against Su
pervisor H. D. Jlowe of having over
charged the county in his mileage bills
Â¦was thrown out of court this afterndon
by Judge W. E. Greene, who held that
Ji"lie proper steps had not been taken to
bring the natter before him. The
t h arses -were made by one J. E. Guil
hault, who alleged on Information and
belief that the facts he swore to were
true. Judge Greene held that the
t-tmrge should have been brought in the
name of the people and should have
been investigated either by a^Justice
of the Peace or a Grand Jury.

Albert M. Hauser, the dishonest
Mint employe, who confessed that he
stole gold from the Mint, was held for
trial by United States Commissioner
Heacock yesterday. His bail was fixed
at $1000. The credit of his detection
is due to United States Secret Service
Agents George W. Hazen and Thomas
B. Foster, who discovered last Jan
uary that fine gold, containing an al
loy of coin silver, was being sold In
this city. They watched the "fence"
for several weeks and their vigilance
was rewarded by seeing a womanen
ter the place and sell to the proprietor
an Ingot valued at 5200. They fol
lowed her to 1279 Union street and
discovered that she was Hauser's wife
and that Hauser was In the melting
department of the Mint. Secret Ser
vice Agent Burns joined in the inves
tigation and arrested Hauser. Tn*e
prisoner made a full confession and
asked that his wife should not be
prosecuted.
Hauser worked in Shreve's for four
teen years.

Prosecution He Makes Full Con
fession of Crime.
MINT THIEF HAUSER
IS HELD FOR TRIAL
One of the articles of agreement
provides that neither of the principals
shall engage in a fistic encounter with
any one before the date of the ar
ranged fight.
The match was arranged by Willie
Britt, brother and manager of the
champion featherweight of yie world,
and Harry Pollok, who tends to the
financial arrangements In- "Young Cor
bett's" , fighting career. The match
was made after many stormy inter
views, during one of which Corbett
claimed he had been robbed by the
decision of Referee Eddie Graney at
the lastÂ£flght in San Francisco. The
conversation occurred in a well known
saloon and Britt spilt out a handful of
gold and greenbacks from his pocket
and said to Corbett:
"I can lick you in an ash barrel,
and if I can't all this money is yours."
Manager Willie Britt interfered and
hostilities were avoided. Both Cor
bett and Pollok are pleased over the
agreement made for the forthcoming
fight and believe that Britt will go
down to 1 defeat. On the other hand,
the champion says that he can "make
a monkey" out of the Denver boy at
their next meeting, and his brother Js
equally positive of the result.
NEW YORK, May 16. â An agree
ment was entered into here to-day be
tween James Britt and "Young Cor
bett" for a twenty-round battle in San
Francisco at some date before Decem
ber 31 of this year, the date to be set
by mutual agreement of the fighters.
The fight is to take place under the
auspices of the athletic club offering
the best inducements.

Customs Inspectors Hustle.
Seldom in the history of the port has the
customs force been confronted with a day's
Â¦work such as was disposed of yesterday.
There is usually plenty to do for every In
spector of every grade and when a big rush
comes occasion arises for a skillful disposition
of the little army of inspectors. The handling
of the force falls to the deputy surveyor of
the port and yesterday Chauncey M. St. John
shewed that he understood his business and
was prepared for any kind of an emergency.
The Umatilla was the first arrival and she
brought a large number of passengers, then
came the Sonoma, followed by the transport
Sherman and the liner Peru. In the midst
of all this the passengers from the Kosmos
liner Serapis were released from quarantine
and landed at Union-street wharf. With such
Judgment did Mr. St. John handle his men
tr-at. wherever a passenger landed, and about
1000 came ashore from all the vessels, there
was an inspector to examine the baggage, and
those that landed at the Mail dock at 7 o'clock
last evening were treated with the same
prompt and courteous attention as was ac
corded those who landed twelve hours earlier
In t^e day from the Umatilla.

TOPEKA, Kans.. May 16.â To-day the
division superintendents of the Santa
Fe Railway system are meeting hqre
and at La Junta to work out the new
time card. The superintendents of tha
gulf lines and the coast lines hold sep
arate meetings from those of the Santa
Fe proper. It is said that few changes
of importance are contemplated. It is
nearing the season of the year when
the California limited train is changed
from daily service to a semi-weekly
service.
Toes Crushed by a Wagon.
The toes of the right foot of George
Mertens, an employe of the Enterprise
Brewery, were crushed yesterday
afternoon. A wagon that was, being
backed through a narrow passage way
caught him in such 'a position that he
could not retreat and one of the
wheels passed over his foot. He was
removed to the Central Emergency
Hospital, . where his injuries were
treated by Dr. Stephen.
Jack Lane will act as master of cere
monies and Jim McDevitt will be of
ficial referee.
The first attraction of the evening's
programme is a little bout between
Willie Sheper of the Hayes Valley Club
and Charles Hlppley of the same insti
tution. They will fight at 120 pounds.
Harry Baker of the Bay City Club and
Harry Williams of the Hayes Valley
will furnish the second bout. Willie
Ingham of the Hayes Valley and John
Kirchen of the Lincoln Club will fight
at 140 pounds. Jim Kane and Charlie
Dunn will next try conclusions at 125
pounds, after which a special event, in
which Jack Moran of the Hayes Valley
Club and Lew Powell of the Hawthorne
Club will mix at ISO pounds. Teddy
Wolff and "Rough House" McDonald,
looked upon as California's best welter
weights, will furnish the first main
event, after which the performance will
be drawn to a close with a grand finale
in the form of a battle royal between
Joe Thomas and George Peterson.
The preliminaries, between Jim Hay
ward, the New York lightweight, and
Henry Lewis, and the one between
Frank Rafael and George Herbert,
promise to be good ones. Each bout is
slated to go ten rounds.
Morris Levy has everything in readi
ness for his little performance to-night,
and as each of the amateurs scheduled
to appear has put a good piece of for
feit money up to guarantee his good
faith there should be no disappoint
ments for the fans at the last moment.
Jim Connolley, manager for Martin
Canole, and Teddy Murphy, who looks
after the pugilistic business affairs of
Battling Nelson, met last night at
Alex Greggalns' cafe on Ellis street
and discussed the referee question for
their contest next Friday night at
Woodward's Pavilion. The men talked
the matter over for more than an hour*
but came to no conclusion as to who
would referee the bout. The names of
Phil Wand, Eddie Graney, Arthur Eck
art, Jack Welch and Billy Roach were
mentioned and it was thought one of
these men will be selected to officiate.
Canole has succeeded in reducing
himself to within one pound of the
weight limit and from now on he will
do but light work. The little vacation
he took from his training quarters the
other day shot up* his weight to 134
pounds, but he will soon get rid of
that by the drylng-up route. Canole's
manager has given it out that he will
bet $1000 on his man at even money.
Connolley lost considerable money on
Canole when the latter fought Britt
at Colma. "I will positively not give
any odds on this fight, Tor I think it is
an even money bet," remarked Con
nolley. "Canole is in great condition
and I will make this one bet of (1000,
but If I have to give odds I will stay
off."
Teddy Murphy Is JuBt as confident
that Nelson will win and he has said
he would make a good bet on Nelson,
but he is waiting to get as good as 10
to 8 for his money.
Canole never looked better and his
trainers are well pleased with his fine
condition and they say by Friday night,
when he meets Battling Nelson, he will
be fit to fight for a championship. The
Massachusetts lad has worked hard
and faithfully the last two weeks and
he is glad the training routine is near
the end. Canole has little to say re
garding his coming contest with Nel
son, but intimates that he is familiar
with the fact that the Chicago man is
a tough nut to crack, that he ex
pects a hard fight and that he is not
underrating him in the least; but that
he will be at his very best, and he also
intimated that he was full of confi
dence and expected to win the deci
sion.
Nelson is as sure of winning from
Canole as he is that he is alive, and
he is planning his future accordingly.
He says Canole's punches will not
bother him in the least, and he feels
that he is bound to catch him at some
stage of the many terrific rushes he
will uncork on the clever Canole.
OAKLAND. May 16.â "Rube" Smith
, of Denver tasted defeat at the hands of
Billy Otts In a scheduled fifteen-round
battle at the Reliance Club in this city
to-nlpht. The battle terminated in
ihe seventh period by a knockout ad
ministered by the local fighter in a
fierce and gory rally.
Up to the sixth round the contest was
*ven. Then began Smith's Waterloo.
He opened the sixth round by scoring
several lefts to Otts' head and then
etopped with his Jaw a terrific wallop
from Billy's right that caused the au
burn-haired Denverite to rock on his
pics and shake his head. Otts. scent-
Ing victory, went viciously after his
man. but Rube fought back like a tiger,

rtar.tly- on coming out for the seventh
round and beat Rube down with a
bombardment of rights and lefts to
the head. Smith took another eight
*<?Â£onds on the canvas and on rising
was sent to the floor for Keeps.
Smith exhibited cleverness with both
hands during the first five rounds and
was generally on the aggressive. He
landed many heavy punches that Otts
*et?slmllated without much apparent
.damage.

MORRIS PARK. May 16.â Hurst Park
won the Claremont handicap to-day
under an impost of 130 pounds, defeat-
Ing by a head Lux Casta, which,- had
she run straight after getting off last,
might have been the winner.
It was Hurst Park's third consecu
tive victory, he having previously won
the Toboggan and Crotona handicaps.
To-day's success was most meritorious
because, in addition to the weight he
carried, the horse was handicapped by
having hit himself in his preliminary,
and it was necessary to usp a simple
remedy to minimize the effect- of the
accident.
Much was expected k from Gay Boy
and Castalian, but both disappointed
their admirers. As v for Lux Casta, she
displayed her usual bad temper at the
barrier and was last away, but went
up fast from her outside position, made
a wide turn into the stretch, came down
the Incline diagonally and then swerved
badly. All this time Hurst Park was
being ridden with great patience by
George Odom, who did not make a bid
until the last furlong. He ran straight
and true and Odom was not required to
resort to the whip. A head was the
verdict in his favor. Two lengths away
was Gay Boy.
The track was "dead" and was at
least a second to the mile slower than
under normal conditions. Summary:

CHICAGO, May 16.â The Worth track
was fast, the weather cloudy and cold

English Lad, the Derby favorite, which
won the fifth race and was a heavily
backed favorite.
Toscan at 11 to 2, backed from 6 to 1,
won the feature event of the card, a
six-furlong handicap, easily from the
extreme outsider Bondage, which was
backed from 75 to 50 to 1. Don JDomo
led after the first half-mile, closely at
tended by Toscan and Schwalbe. Tos
can passed his field easily when called
upon and won as he pleased. Bondage
closed with' a wild rush and beat Don
Domo three lengths Â¦ for the place.

other at 7:15 p. m., and an extra train'
to the same point on all days except
Saturdays and Sundays at 5:15 p. m.
Six more trains are placed on the runs

Albert M. Hauser, the dishonest
Mint employe, who confessed that he
stole gold from the Mint, was held for
trial by United States Commissioner
Heacock yesterday. His bail was fixed
at $1000. The credit of his detection
is due to United States Secret Service
Agents George W. Hazen and Thomas
B. Foster, who discovered last Jan
uary that fine gold, containing an al
loy of coin silver, was being sold In
this city. They watched the "fence"
for several weeks and their vigilance
was rewarded by seeing a womanen
ter the place and sell to the proprietor
an Ingot valued at 5200. They fol
lowed her to 1279 Union street and
discovered that she was Hauser's wife
and that Hauser was In the melting
department of the Mint. Secret Ser
vice Agent Burns joined in the inves
tigation and arrested Hauser. Tn*e
prisoner made a full confession and
asked that his wife should not be
prosecuted.
Hauser worked in Shreve's for four
teen years.

Prosecution He Makes Full Con

MINT THIEF HAUSER
IS HELD FOR TRIAL
One of the articles of agreement
provides that neither of the principals
shall engage in a fistic encounter with
any one before the date of the ar
ranged fight.
The match was arranged by Willie
Britt, brother and manager of the
champion featherweight of yie world,
and Harry Pollok, who tends to the
financial arrangements In- "Young Cor
bett's" , fighting career. The match
was made after many stormy inter
views, during one of which Corbett
claimed he had been robbed by the
decision of Referee Eddie Graney at
the lastÂ£flght in San Francisco. The
conversation occurred in a well known
saloon and Britt spilt out a handful of
gold and greenbacks from his pocket
and said to Corbett:
"I can lick you in an ash barrel,
and if I can't all this money is yours."
Manager Willie Britt interfered and
hostilities were avoided. Both Cor
bett and Pollok are pleased over the
agreement made for the forthcoming
fight and believe that Britt will go
down to 1 defeat. On the other hand,
the champion says that he can "make
a monkey" out of the Denver boy at
their next meeting, and his brother Js
equally positive of the result.
NEW YORK, May 16. â An agree
ment was entered into here to-day be
tween James Britt and "Young Cor
bett" for a twenty-round battle in San
Francisco at some date before Decem
ber 31 of this year, the date to be set
by mutual agreement of the fighters.
The fight is to take place under the
auspices of the athletic club offering

Customs Inspectors Hustle.
Seldom in the history of the port has the
customs force been confronted with a day's
Â¦work such as was disposed of yesterday.
There is usually plenty to do for every In
spector of every grade and when a big rush
comes occasion arises for a skillful disposition
of the little army of inspectors. The handling
of the force falls to the deputy surveyor of
the port and yesterday Chauncey M. St. John
shewed that he understood his business and
was prepared for any kind of an emergency.
The Umatilla was the first arrival and she
brought a large number of passengers, then
came the Sonoma, followed by the transport
Sherman and the liner Peru. In the midst
of all this the passengers from the Kosmos
liner Serapis were released from quarantine
and landed at Union-street wharf. With such
Judgment did Mr. St. John handle his men
tr-at. wherever a passenger landed, and about
1000 came ashore from all the vessels, there
was an inspector to examine the baggage, and
those that landed at the Mail dock at 7 o'clock
last evening were treated with the same
prompt and courteous attention as was ac
corded those who landed twelve hours earlier
In t^e day from the Umatilla.

TOPEKA, Kans.. May 16.â To-day the
division superintendents of the Santa
Fe Railway system are meeting hqre
and at La Junta to work out the new
time card. The superintendents of tha
gulf lines and the coast lines hold sep
arate meetings from those of the Santa
Fe proper. It is said that few changes
of importance are contemplated. It is
nearing the season of the year when
the California limited train is changed
from daily service to a semi-weekly
service.
Toes Crushed by a Wagon.
The toes of the right foot of George
Mertens, an employe of the Enterprise
Brewery, were crushed yesterday
afternoon. A wagon that was, being
backed through a narrow passage way
caught him in such 'a position that he
could not retreat and one of the
wheels passed over his foot. He was
removed to the Central Emergency
Hospital, . where his injuries were
treated by Dr. Stephen.
Jack Lane will act as master of cere
monies and Jim McDevitt will be of
ficial referee.
The first attraction of the evening's
programme is a little bout between
Willie Sheper of the Hayes Valley Club
and Charles Hlppley of the same insti
tution. They will fight at 120 pounds.
Harry Baker of the Bay City Club and
Harry Williams of the Hayes Valley
will furnish the second bout. Willie
Ingham of the Hayes Valley and John
Kirchen of the Lincoln Club will fight
at 140 pounds. Jim Kane and Charlie
Dunn will next try conclusions at 125
pounds, after which a special event, in
which Jack Moran of the Hayes Valley
Club and Lew Powell of the Hawthorne
Club will mix at ISO pounds. Teddy
Wolff and "Rough House" McDonald,
looked upon as California's best welter
weights, will furnish the first main
event, after which the performance will
be drawn to a close with a grand finale
in the form of a battle royal between
Joe Thomas and George Peterson.
The preliminaries, between Jim Hay
ward, the New York lightweight, and
Henry Lewis, and the one between
Frank Rafael and George Herbert,
promise to be good ones. Each bout is
slated to go ten rounds.
Morris Levy has everything in readi
ness for his little performance to-night,
and as each of the amateurs scheduled
to appear has put a good piece of for
feit money up to guarantee his good
faith there should be no disappoint
ments for the fans at the last moment.
Jim Connolley, manager for Martin
Canole, and Teddy Murphy, who looks
after the pugilistic business affairs of
Battling Nelson, met last night at
Alex Greggalns' cafe on Ellis street
and discussed the referee question for
their contest next Friday night at
Woodward's Pavilion. The men talked
the matter over for more than an hour*
but came to no conclusion as to who
would referee the bout. The names of
Phil Wand, Eddie Graney, Arthur Eck
art, Jack Welch and Billy Roach were
mentioned and it was thought one of
these men will be selected to officiate.
Canole has succeeded in reducing
himself to within one pound of the
weight limit and from now on he will
do but light work. The little vacation
he took from his training quarters the
other day shot up* his weight to 134
pounds, but he will soon get rid of
that by the drylng-up route. Canole's
manager has given it out that he will
bet $1000 on his man at even money.
Connolley lost considerable money on
Canole when the latter fought Britt
at Colma. "I will positively not give
any odds on this fight, Tor I think it is
an even money bet," remarked Con
nolley. "Canole is in great condition
and I will make this one bet of (1000,
but If I have to give odds I will stay
off."
Teddy Murphy Is JuBt as confident
that Nelson will win and he has said
he would make a good bet on Nelson,
but he is waiting to get as good as 10
to 8 for his money.
Canole never looked better and his
trainers are well pleased with his fine
condition and they say by Friday night,
when he meets Battling Nelson, he will
be fit to fight for a championship. The
Massachusetts lad has worked hard
and faithfully the last two weeks and
he is glad the training routine is near
the end. Canole has little to say re
garding his coming contest with Nel
son, but intimates that he is familiar
with the fact that the Chicago man is
a tough nut to crack, that he ex
pects a hard fight and that he is not
underrating him in the least; but that
he will be at his very best, and he also
intimated that he was full of confi
dence and expected to win the deci
sion.
Nelson is as sure of winning from
Canole as he is that he is alive, and
he is planning his future accordingly.
He says Canole's punches will not
bother him in the least, and he feels
that he is bound to catch him at some
stage of the many terrific rushes he
will uncork on the clever Canole.
OAKLAND. May 16.â "Rube" Smith
, of Denver tasted defeat at the hands of
Billy Otts In a scheduled fifteen-round
battle at the Reliance Club in this city
to-nlpht. The battle terminated in
ihe seventh period by a knockout ad
ministered by the local fighter in a
fierce and gory rally.
Up to the sixth round the contest was
*ven. Then began Smith's Waterloo.
He opened the sixth round by scoring
several lefts to Otts' head and then
etopped with his Jaw a terrific wallop
from Billy's right that caused the au
burn-haired Denverite to rock on his
pics and shake his head. Otts. scent-
Ing victory, went viciously after his
man. but Rube fought back like a tiger,

-count of eight he revived and had Otts

rtar.tly- on coming out for the seventh
round and beat Rube down with a
bombardment of rights and lefts to
the head. Smith took another eight
*<?Â£onds on the canvas and on rising
was sent to the floor for Keeps.
Smith exhibited cleverness with both
hands during the first five rounds and
was generally on the aggressive. He
landed many heavy punches that Otts
*et?slmllated without much apparent
.damage.

MORRIS PARK. May 16.â Hurst Park
won the Claremont handicap to-day
under an impost of 130 pounds, defeat-
Ing by a head Lux Casta, which,- had
she run straight after getting off last,
might have been the winner.
It was Hurst Park's third consecu
tive victory, he having previously won
the Toboggan and Crotona handicaps.
To-day's success was most meritorious
because, in addition to the weight he
carried, the horse was handicapped by
having hit himself in his preliminary,
and it was necessary to usp a simple
remedy to minimize the effect- of the
accident.
Much was expected k from Gay Boy
and Castalian, but both disappointed
their admirers. As v for Lux Casta, she
displayed her usual bad temper at the
barrier and was last away, but went
up fast from her outside position, made
a wide turn into the stretch, came down
the Incline diagonally and then swerved
badly. All this time Hurst Park was
being ridden with great patience by
George Odom, who did not make a bid
until the last furlong. He ran straight
and true and Odom was not required to
resort to the whip. A head was the
verdict in his favor. Two lengths away
was Gay Boy.
The track was "dead" and was at
least a second to the mile slower than
under normal conditions. Summary:

CHICAGO, May 16.â The Worth track
was fast, the weather cloudy and cold

English Lad, the Derby favorite, which
won the fifth race and was a heavily
backed favorite.
Toscan at 11 to 2, backed from 6 to 1,
won the feature event of the card, a
six-furlong handicap, easily from the
extreme outsider Bondage, which was
backed from 75 to 50 to 1. Don JDomo
led after the first half-mile, closely at
tended by Toscan and Schwalbe. Tos
can passed his field easily when called
upon and won as he pleased. Bondage
closed with' a wild rush and beat Don

Purely Mansfield is "Ivan the Terrl
â¢ble." a tragedy by Count Alexis Tolstoi,
" produced fpr the first time "out West"
by Richard Mansfield last night at the
'Cojumbia, and purely a triumph at
fhat. With but one other figure of
. p/nchable flesh in the piece, Boris Godu
â¢ noff, Mansfield carries the play's five
acts â scenes perdie â upon his own
Shoulders. And one laments only the
Â¦Â¦ moments when his grotesquely fasci-
V.ating figure is absent. Plus Mansfield
"Ivan the Terrible" is a picture of vic
torious power; without him â or an Irr
ingâlt were pitifully ineffective.
A TItfOlPlf FOR 51 AXSFIEL.D.
But Manyfleld there was last night,
and the night was his. It is nine years
ago eince tbe greatest American actor
rkade his last bow to a San Francisco
audience. They gave him nine years'
Â° interest on their greeting last night.
The conventional first night audienceâ
everybodyâ was there, but the applause
was worthy of the Central. It failed to
c draw the expected speech. They want
ed it after the first act. Then after the
second. Then the third, and after the
fourth they whistled, stamped and cat
called after the regal figure had made
c ius curt little bow right through with
fbe music until the last act.
That' means things at the Columbia,
a c nd the particular effsuion meant the
triumph of a personality.
A play, in the accepted sense of the
word, "Ivan the Terrible" is not. It
ig a series of episodes in the last year
of the life of that Ivan, Czar of Rus
sia, nicknamed "The Terrible." Writ
ten t*iirty years ago, the play was
. outlawed in Russia for political rea
sons until three years ago. It is pre
sented by Mr. Mansfield exactly as
given then at the Alexandre Theater.
tfL Petersburg.
MUST BE UNDERSTOOD.
Undoubtedly the drama, as a drama,
loses weight in its Western environ
. ment. A tyrrany to which a Russian
audience may still bring a sympathetic
shudder we can here bring only a dif
ficult credulity. And Mr. Mansfield
.has much more to surmount than this.
By the grace of a programme footnote
one is given to understand the causes
in the inculted. cramped and de
graded childhood of Ivan, of his raon
etrous later development. So some
sympathy for and comprehension of
the character are possible. The play
tells naught of this. The climax finds
the senile tyrant exactly what the
first act finds him, an overshadowing
terror, debauched with ape-like van
ity, rotten with superstition and pois
oned with the exercise of absolute, ir
responsible power.
But Mr. Mansfield is magnificently
sufficient herein. He is an unforget
table picture, regal, terrible, animal
throughout, splendidly convincing.
The actor is excellently supported by
Arthur Forrest as Godunoft in partic
ular, and Ida Conquest as the Czarina.
Nothing since Irving has equaled the
"scenic setting in magnificence, and the
costumes and every accessory ehow
lavish caxe and generosity. To
night "Old Heidelberg" will be pre
sented. BLANCHE PARTIXGTON.
Alcazar.
. The Alcazar players gave a highly
Creditable production last night of
"Colinette," a clever comedv adapted
â¢ from the French. The play tells the
tale of how Colinette, enacted by Adele
I JBIock, saves her husband from death
' for- having conspired against King
lxjuis XVIII in the interest of Bona
parte. The best art In the piece is
the last, wherein the King, having
tired of the numerous conspiracies
against himself, suggests to Colinette
the manner of consummating her hus
band's escape. Butler, who played the
King, probably did the best work of
all and, barring a disposition to utilize
all the strong tones of his stentorian
voice, is all that can be desired in the
part. Adele Block played Colinette
with grace and will undoubtedly im
prove with successive performances.
James Durkin was splendid as Adrien.
Colinette'e husband, and Luke Conness
was more natural than he ever has
been as D'Albarede. John Maher gavÂ«
a capital impersonation of Puygiron
and his identity was positively lost
in his make-up. George Oeboume
was irresistible as the Duke Rivecourt
and Harry Hilliaxd was painstaking
as Collieres, one of the plotters against
the King. Walter Belasco was good as
â¢Aristlde and Frances Starr was dainty
in the small part of the dressmaker.

The *">ntra! Th*-atÂ«T followed up its

scenes to the echo. The play is on the
order of "Shore Acres." One of the

""Well, you can't expect to find a
Paderew6ki punching the ivories in a
tenderloin saloon," said his Honor. "But
I will consider the provocation more
fully and sentence you to-morrow."
Two negro instrumentalists were per
forming in a Turk-street saloon last
Saturday evening when Private John
Russell, Company L, Twentieth United
States Infantry, told them his sense of
melody was shocked and if they .did not
cease their creation of discord he would
compel them to do so. They ignored
his protest and were hammering and
strumming out something that bore re
mote resemblance to "Mary Ann Mc-
Cann" when he pounced upon them,
disabled a banjo and severely crippled
a piano. Then he resisted interference
by the proprietor of the place, Frank
Christiansen, and was arrested and
charged with battery.
In response to an interrogative glance
from Judge Mogan the defendant sa
luted the bench a la militaire, stood
rigidly at attention and pleaded that
his disorderly conduct was provoked
by the colored men's inartistic manipu
lation of the instruments. . "The pianist
was the worst," he plaintively added.

their specialty; the three Millards,

LO9 ANGELES, May 16. â An explo
sion of a Santa Fe freight engine oc
curred near Bagdad, San Bernardino
County, last night, in which Engineer
Ebbutt was killed and Fireman Sho
walter slightly hurt.
According to the information re
ceived at the Santa Fe headquarters in
this city the engine was a "pusher"
on a westbound freight train. The ex
plosion occurred when the train was
on a heavy upgrade, but the exact
cause of the accident has not been
ascertained. The engine was badly
demolished, but the track was not in
jured nor traffic delayed.
It was officially denied at the office
of the Santa Fe general manager here
that the present labor difficulties of
the company are in any way respon
sible for the accident.
The fact was pointed out that the
boiler-makers, whose work would
have largely to do with the condition
of the engine when it left the shops,
are not on strike in the Arizona di
vision, from which this engine was
cent out.
Engineer A. S. Ebbutt died while
being brought to this city and his
body arrived here this morning.

most beautiful scenes is that of the
illuminated cathedral on the sands,
while the mechanical and electrical ef
fects of a midnight storm at sea were

makes a thrilling close to the storm
scene. James Montgomery, the new
member of the Central stock company,
handled with effect the exacting role of
the young village parson, whose heart
and mind are at war, as In a battle be
tween love and duty. Eugenie Thais
Lawton, as the parson's betrothed
wife, shone to advantage in a highly
emotional part. Henry Shumer, as the
gentleman villain, gave a strong im
personation, and Elmer Booth, in a He
brew character part, made a decided
hit. George Xicholls, Ernest Howell and
George Webster have good character
parts, and Edna Ellsmere was pleasing
as a maiden bent on spreading the gos
pel of happiness. Baby Frances, in a
pretty child part, gave evidence of rare
cleverness.

BATON ROUGE, La., May 16.â In
the presence of a multitude gathered
in the grounds of the State Capitol to
day, Newton C. Blanchard was inaug
urated as Governor. In his inaugural
address Governor 'Blanchard said:
"Mob law in contravention and de
fiance of law will not be tolerated.
Lynchings will not be permitted under
any circumstances. The negro is here.
He is a man and a citizen. He is use
ful and valuable in his sphere. Within
that sphere he must be guaranteed the
equal protection of the law and his
education and proper lines â mainly
agricultural and industrialâ is at once
a duty and a necessity. He must be
protected in his right to live peace
ably and quietly, in his right to labor
and enjoy the fruits of his labor. He
must be encouraged to industry and
taught habits of thrift.
"No approach toward social equality
or social recognition will be ever :oler
ated in Louisiana. Separate schools,
separate churches, separate cars, sep
arate places of entertainment will be en
forced. Racial distinction and integ
rity must be preserved. But there is
room enough in this broad southland,
with proper lines of limitation and de
marcation, for the two races to live
on terms of mutual trust, mutual help,
good understanding and concord. The
South asserts its ability to handle and
solve the negro questionÂ«on humani
tarian linesâ those of justice and of
right. We brook no Interference from
without."

. ST. PAUL, Minn., May 16.â Reports
received here at the Northern Pacific
offices from division headquarters in
the West tell how Mrs. A. J. Barlow,
v/ife of a section foreman in the State
of Washington, saved the life of a tel
egraph operator, who was shot by a
bandit, and then telegraphed the news
to headquarters, resulting in the cap
ture of the outlaw.
C. J. Ingraham, station agent at
Snoqualamle, Wash., was about to
lock up the safe and leave the office
for the night, when a bandit thrust a
heavy revolver through a pane of glass
and shot him. He then entered and de
manded Ingraham's keys, but the
agent refused to deliver them. The
bandit shot him again and then rifled
the safe and money drawers and es
caped, leaving the agent lying in a
pool of blood on the floor desperately
wounded.
Mrs. Barlow, wife of the section fore
man, heard the shots, and, although
alone and unarmed, rushed from the
section-house to the station, and.
Instantly realizing that Ingraham
must have medical aid, sat down at
the telegraph key and sent an account
of the shooting to an adjacent station
and to division headquarters. She then
carried the wounded man to a bench,
and, tearing her skirt into bandages,
dressed his "wounds. When help came
she had stopped the blood and rendered
all the skill first aid could have ac
complished. Ingraham was put under
a surgeon's care and then sent to a
hospital.
The man under arrest has been
identified as one Bridges, and is on
his way to jail at Seattle.

For they were professional mystics
from the cut-rate revelation factory at
406 Geary street, and it was there that
"Dr." Rlchsteln, it Is alleged, com
mitted the offense charged against him.
His wife was the stellar palmist of the
establishment and her five companions
were witnesses summoned by the
prosecution. They expressed willing
ness to testify to the defendant's guilt,
and the court assumed that they would
be equally willing to contribute their
pyschological talents to his capture.
The assumption was not unwisely ven
tured, for in the chase the officer is ac
companied by enough clairvoyancy
and other eerie agencies to unearth
Dunham or locate the Rio. .
There Is nothing original about Mrs.
Richsteln's latest complaint against
her husband. It was preceded almost
word for word about two months ago,
Half-a-dozen middle-aged women,
somberly clad and thickly veiled, sat
in Judge Mogan's courtroom yester
day morning and vainly awaited the
coming of "Dr." John J. Rlchsteln, ac
cused of threatening to kill his wife.
When the hour of adjournment arrived
a bench warrant was issued for the
defendant's arrest and the policeman
to whom service of the document was
entrusted received a hint from the
bench that the six ladies in black
might be able to lend occult aid to his
quest.
George Rocco and George Manicuto
disturbed the Sabbath peace of China
town by driving their horses and wag-
Harry. Clark, a University of Califor
nia student, was pronounced guilty of
disturbing the peace by annoying two
respectable young women on Sacra
mento street, near Fillmore, at 1:30
o'clock one morning last week, and will
be sentenced to-day. The complainants
testified that after he had accosted
them and been repulsed he insisted on
walking with them. and did walk with
them until they gave him Into custody.
A youth who was with Clark escaped.
Earl E. Waterman's wife appeared
with an infant in her arms and in
formed Judge Mogan that she had de
cided to withdraw her request that her
husband be sent to jail for ill-treating
her.
"I expected as much,"<sald his Honor
to the woman. Then, sternly, to the
man. "If you come up here again for
neglecting your family I'll refuse to
consider your wife's forgiveness. Go
home,"
Bailiff Hickey's words were audible
only to Clerk Grey, but even the pris
oners in the cage heard the whispered
response, "Of course, it's a bluff."
For the third time B. Ghaeffoli,
blacksmith, stood accused of blocking
Oregon street, between Front and Da
vis, by allowing nine wagons to stand
in the roadway over night. The previ
ous offenses were condoned by Judge
Mogan, but the third one provoked a
$20 fine.
"Drel dimes an' ouid, eh, what?" said
the defendant, facetiously.
"That's what," was the pleasant re
sponse from the bench. "And your next
violation of the ordinance may mean
four* times and in."
There was joy in. the City Prison
when an order from Judge Mogan re
leased fifteen snakes of various kinds
which had been held there since Sat
urday night as evidence against Carl
S. Davis, charged with stealing them
from an itinerant showman by whom
he had been employed as advance
agent. Davis failed to appear for trial,
and the serpents were turned over to
the custody of the complaining wit
ness.
It wasn't fear of their effect upon
the mind3 of the human prisoners that
made the snakes abnoxlous to the jail
ors, because most of the cell Inmates
were inured to imagined association
with rattlers and garters and other
menagerie curios and could not be
frightened Â«by night of real varmints.
It was the visiting policemen whose
nerves were in danger of being upset
by sqoing snakes and not knowing they
were genuine.
â¢ * â¢
There was no surplus adipose attach
ed to any of the "hop-heads" who ap
peared before Judge Mogan in con
nection with the case of William
Wheatley, charged with holding up a
Chinese opium den and robbing four
male inmates one night last week.
Wheatley himself looked as if his
earthly tenure is limited, and the vic
tims of his alleged raid bore unmis
takable symptoms of familiarity with
the life-shortening delights of the
"long draw." One of them was a full
blood negro, but the fumes of the poppy
juice had lightened his complexion to
an ashen gray.
The story published at the time of the
holdup was repeated in court and no
new details were brought out. When
the defense asked for time to prove
an alibi the Judge continued the hear
ing till next Thursday.
"Bill" Higglns has been a confirmed
opium fiend for twenty consecutive
years, yet he tipped the bean at 187
pounds as he stood before Judge Fritz
and denied he was a vagrant.
"I hit de dope, all right," said Wil
liam, "but I work fer de dough to buy
it wid. A gÂ«nt hez a puffet right ter
do wot he likes wld his own dough,
hesn't he?"
"How do you manage to retain your
flesh?" the Judge inquired.
"Aw, dis ain't flesh â dis is jest bone
an' mussel," answered "Bill," display
ing a bared and brawny arm.
"What a man you'd be if you did not
use opium," was the aamiring com
ment of the Judge, who is something
of an athlete himself.
"An' wot a lot uv comfort I'd miss,"
was "Bill's" rejoinder.
Then he was dismissed.
. . .A
when the defendant was dismissed with
a reprimÂ£md after he had promised to
let the woman pursue in peace her
chosen calling of reading human hands
at 10 cents per perusal. It was to em
bark as a professional palmist that she
left his bed and board, and he seemed
satisfied with single harness until he
ascertained that she was literally mak
ing money hand over fist. Then he
haunted her chamber of mystery and
threatened to kill her if she did not
either return to him or divide her
earnings. That's the story she told
in court and he failed to controvert it.
After his dismissal and warning the
"doctor" resumed visiting the Geary
street shop and pestering the women
therein engaged, but not until 7:30
o'clock last Sunday evening did he se
riously fracture the peace. Then, en
raged by his wife's obduracy to his
pleadings for reconciliation, he started
to "clean out" the place and had
worked sad and irreparable havoc ere
his destructive hand was stayed by the
arresting policeman. The property de
stroyed by him includes a number of
palm imprints of prominent persons
and a sheaf of horoscopes In process
of construction. But more damaging
than any material vandalism was the
effect of his berserk behavior upon the
minds of the seeresses. He utterly
routed the mental tranquillity that is
so absolutely essential to surveying
the future, inspecting current hap
penings at the other side of the uni
verse or communing with the shades
of folk gone before, and some of the
women fear that their departed equa
nimity will not be fully restored until
he is permanently removed from their
thoughts.
All these considerations "will be de
liberately weighed when the Judge has
the elusive defendant before him in the
flesh.
Woman Accuses Him of Threatening to Kill Her
and Other Feminine Professors of the Occult
Charge Him With Destroying Valuable Property
HUSBAND OF SEERESS FAILS
TO ANSWER SERIOUS CHARGE
Threa vagrants were given twenty
four hours apiece by Judge Mogan
after they had pleaded as follows:
Abe Raymond â "Was waiting to see
the sun rise when a policeman arrested
him at midnight on Sacramento street.
Thomas Ahearn â Going to work \rhen
he was arrested at 3 o'clock a. m. on
Kearny street. He had been arrested
several times previously just as he was
proceeding to work after a long period
of Idleness.
John Mariner 1 â Was going to release a
coat which he had pledged for drinks
when an unreasonable patrolman took
him In. Could not remember exactly
where he had pledged the coat.
Joseph ILgan. a striking stableman.
was arraigned before Judge Mogan for
drunkenness and assault with a deadly
weapon on J. W. Fuller, a non-union
stableman, and the case will be heard
next Thursday.
H. L. Cochran, also a hostler on
strike, was fined $20 by Judge Fritz for
carrying a revolver. He was arrested
at the ferry station and failed to show
necessity for having the deadly weapon
in his possession.
â¢ * â¢
"I scratched his face and then he just
shoved mine a little," said Mabel Wil
liams, but Judge Mogan pronounced M.
Griffin, an Eddy-street saloon-keeper,
guilty of battery, just the same as if
Mabel had not tried to lighten his of
fense.
"Your story might bring intended re
sult," said his Honor to the woman, "if
you had not deliberately tried to avoid
appearing in this court after you had
complained that this paramour of
yours had blackened your eyes and cut
your lip with his fist. I will sentence
him to-morrow."
one at breakneck speed through the
most crowded thoroughfares of that
quarter, and Judge Fritz fined them
$2 60 apiece.
As the policeman described the dash-
Ing pace at which the horses were go
ing the Judge glanced at the swart
faces of the young defendants and said
something about the blood that surged
in- the veins of a multitude when Ben
Hur guided his steeds to victory
against the Roman charioteer.

WHEATâ Broomhall ' cabled from Liverpool
that that market was depressed by fine weath
er, large world's shipments and partial relief
of the drought in Roumanla. Tha world's
shipments for the week wera as follows, in
quarters: Russian, 404,000; Danublan, CO, 000;
Argentine. 871,000; Indian, 138,000; Australian.
43,000. The American visible supply decreased
1,64.1,000 bushels.
Chicago advanced 2%c and this market for
futures was also higher In sympathy. The
cash grain was likewise firm, with sales of
extra choice. California Club at $1 35.
Wheat and Other Grains.
Despite the Increased competition and lower
prices of deciduous fruits and berries, trade In
the Orange market continued active and prices
of all grades were maintained with a marked
degree of firmness. Smalt and medium sizes
of â¢ Navels." particularly Â¦ 176s and . 216s, "were
eagerly sought after and. some lota commin'Ied
a premium. The large sizes were plentiful,- but
moved, - off freely. Â» Tbe â¢ auction sale drew | a
large attendance I of . Jobber*.! who. bought Â» on
size rather than quality. 'Desirable lots were
keenly ' competed for and , In some . Instances'
choice Navels brought as much as fancy.
Twelve cars* were sold as follows: Fancy. $2Â®
2 25 :' choice, fl 20^2 $1 10Â©l 7fJ.
The other Citrus fruits were unchanged. There
were 3354' bunches of Bananas and 220 crates
, Receipts of Strawberries continued large, ag
gregating about 1100 chests, and the market
ruled weak at lower prices, as the bulk of the
receipts showed the effects of the hot weather,
being more or less sunburnt, and retailers did
not care to purchase any more than absolutely
necessary to satisfy their, regular trade. The
ruling prices for the large varieties were $2??3
per chest. I the minimum quotation representing
the price obtained I for - surplus stocks on tha
clean-up. . Dewberries from Los Angeles sold
at 8@10c per basket and Raspberries from tho
same section brought 10@15c. Some of tbe lat
ter came to hand in very poor condition. Small
common Gooseberries were offering again and
sales were reported -at * 50c per 10-lb drawer.
Offerings of Apricots I consisted chiefly of car
rled-over lots and prices ranged lower. Cher
ries-arrived freely, and sold at a wide 'range
as to variety and color. - .

Northern Wheat Market.
In spite of the continued he^vy receipts of
Butter there is no serious accumulation of
stock, as the local consumptive demand is very
fair, and in addition there are large Alaskan
orders, which are j keeping the surplus down.
Furthermore, the usual small packing orders,
taken in the aggregate, make a very respect
able quantity, so all around the market Is
absorbing the liberal receipts. Stocks - are
ample, however, and ths martlet is rather easy
than otherwise. â¢
Cheese is lower, as supplies have again sur
passed tho demand. Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ '
Eggs continue weak and are coming in from
a' number of outside sources. Three or four
can) of Eastern ' have -arrived within as many
days, and Fresno, which has been shipping to
Los Angeles, la now shipping to this market.

SEW YORK. May 16. â The stock marke'

gravitated to a lower level In an Irregular
way. without much resistance. The depressing:
causes were Uw quite general dlstruet and
hesitation reflected in the business v.-ortd and
the rapid changes taking place In the resources
i>: ihe money market l.y reason of the heavy
pold eutgu. A special aggravating cause was
the n-newal of the liquidation in the Erie
Ftccks, with the acute weakness resulting.
The special Wfakr.e** rather more than offset
the sustaining influence of the firmer tone for
Initfj States h-teel prererred. The BUi>port

Â« arly and haul a cheering effect uinjn the gen
eral market. The weakness became fairiy
general in the mids<?5sion trading, the grain
and cotton carriers being especially, affected.
Ite selling Of these stocks was bused on the
weather conditions in the crop regions. The
of goM already made for ex
port, were added to hy onry $7rÂ»0.0<K>. of which
$500,0<JO waÂ» for Thursday. But this limita
tion Â»Â»! <JUe to the exhaustion of the FUb

l-oiipr.-ier.l of ?2.r^;,!AiO of the shipment in
tended for Tuesday until Thursday wan due
to the time cause. The tone of the foreign
exchange market shoved no tlgnc of relaxa
tion. Railroad earnings, reports of traffic of
fiiials and a reduction in the price of copper
failc-d to offer any help to the *tock market.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
Crop prospects are about the only feature
at present. It is generally admitted that the
Almond yield will be small this year, probably
not over a third of a crop, owing to heavy
rains while the trees were in bloom, though
this shortage will be more or less offset by the
very fair crop promlsÂ«d in Europe. Peaches
are expected to run- about the same as last
year. Ajrlcots will be a light crop, rather
more than last year. These, of course, are
merely estimates based on reports thus far
received and may be modified later on.

The opening in July was a shade lower to %#
%c higher at 83?ic to 84V*c. . There was an
urgent demand from shorts during the entire
day. There was also active buying to replenish
long lines. Offerings were comparatively light.
In order to secure any considerable amount of
wheat It was necessary to bid up prices rapid
ly. A matter which attracted much attention
from speculative traders was the fancy prices
paid here for cash wheat, a sale of 10,000 bush
els of No. 1 Northern being reported at l%e
over the May price. The strength In the cash
situation in outside markets was an additional
bull factor. A semi-official Russian crop . re
port was quite bullish, declaring that unfavor
able weather had greatly retarded the growing '
plant. The visible supply showed a greater de- }
crease than had been expected â a decrease of
1.C33.O0O ."bushels â and this fact added to the j
strength. The demand continued active through- j
out the session, but offerings were at no time :
large. The market closed almost at the top
price of the day. closing figures on July being
at SS^c. May sold between 91*ic and 93%c .
and closed at the high price. i
An advancing tendency. In line with the \
strength in wheat, was experienced In the corn
market A strong fpeling prevailed at the
clo^e. July opened %@vic to 1 /4'9%e higher at :
47^ic to 47%c, advanced to 48%c and closed
at 48c.
Oats shared in the strength of the other
grains, ruling firm. After opening a shade
lower to a shade higher at 3SV4e to S8%c July
sold up to 3S*i@3STÂ£e and closed at 38%c.
Notwithstanding a decline of 10c in hogs, the
provisions market was firm, due mainly to the j
strength of grains. Offerings were restricted ,
and were eagerly taken by shorts. July pork
closed with a gain of 10c, final figures being ,
at 111 27Vi- Lard was up 15c and ribs closed
5#7%c higher. '

The Tavern of Tamalpais will receive
its patrons by the new time schedule of
the Tamalpais Railway, which goes Into
effect to-day, as advertised in the rail
way columns. This most delightful of
all mountain rides in the world is the de
light of globe trotters and tourists gen
erally. Besides meriting the appellation
of the crookedest railroad in the world,
it affords kaleidoscopic views of'moun
tain, sea and valley unequaled anywhere.
â¢ Every weekday morning a gravity car
leaves the hotel to accommodate early

the longest stretch of straight track, one's
neck becomes twisted much like a cork

CONFERENCE OF CHURCHES.
Dr. A. C. Bothe, City Chemist, was
the first witness examined in the^ trial,
which was not opened until afternoon
because of the amount of testimony in
troduced in the Hutton contempt pro
ceedings at the morning session. Bothe
testified to the contents of Blaise's
stomach when it was received from the
Coroner's office. He said he found in
dications that in addition to the meal
taken In the restaurant deceased had
eaten crab or some character of shell
fish. General Salomon made, the most
of this point as tending to show that
Blaise partook of food not furnished
at the Mexican restaurant, where he
and Soeder* ate their last dinner.
Following him came Miss Clothilde
Vallarta, who testified to the dinner
which ' Blaise and Soeder took at the
restaurant on the* evening of January
10. She asked for an interpreter.; , The
vital . points of her testimony \ related
merely to what was served .to the, two
men and the tim*>of their departure;
.which she placed at between 6 o'clock
She was 'the one attractive feature
in the courtroom. A hat laden with
violets and surmounted by a beautiful
white ostrich plume decked a face that
was peculiarly remindful of Anna Held
except for the eyes. Her sister was
more plainly dressed, but both were
laughingly proud of the notoriety.
At the end of the hearing Soeder
was asked If Miss Marie ValLarta was
in love with him. "No sabe nada," said
the defendant, which In Spanish means
that he knew nothing. Even un
der the promptings of his chief
counsel, General Salomon, he refused
to answer any questions regarding
Miss Marie Vallarta. Afterward, in
the jaii, he stated that hie knew her
only as he would know ! any other
woman waiting on table in a res
taurant where he was In the habit of
taking his meals, and that she had
told the full truth regarding his vis
its to the restaurant.
The two Vallarta girls have been
counted upon by the prosecution as an
important link in the testimony con
necting Soeder with the murder of
Blaise. Both were on the stand yes
terday and their testimony leaned to
ward the defendant. When Miss Marie
Vallarta was called to the stand she
smiled on everybody she had ever seen
In connection with the case, and among
those she recognized was Leon Soeder.
She showed her white teeth to him
with a bow, and he smited back awk
wardly.
LOOKS LIKE AXXA HELD.
It had been proved by the prosecu
tion that the cause of Blaise's death
was a stab wound in the carotid artery.
It had been shown that Soeder secured
Insurance on his brother-in-law's life
to the extent of $13,000. Except a $3000
accident policy, all of the insurance
was made payable to Blaise's wife, who
is Boeder's sister.
One of the main witnesses for the
prosecution in the trial of Leon Soeder
for the murder of his brother-in-law,
Joseph Blaise, on the night of January
10 of this year, has fallen down. She is
Miss Marie Vallarta, one of the two
sisters who were proprietors of the res
taurant at 721 Broadway, where Blaise
and Soeder ate dinner on the night of
January 10. On the following morning
Blaise was found below a retaining
wall on Taylor street, between Green
and Vallcjo, with his throat cut and
the marks of a blunt instrument on
the back of his head.
Chinese Watchmen Dismissed.
Walter S. Bates and T. T. Brown,
watchmen at the detention ehed on the
Mail dock in the service of the Unit
ed States Immigration Bureau, were
summarily dismissed from their po
sitions yesterday by order of the De
partment of Commerce and Labor.
They had been recently the complain
ants against Chinese Inspector M. R.
Blackburn, watchman in charsre, and
the department found that there was
no foundation for the charges and
that the work of the bureau would bÂ»*
done better and more speedily without
the two watchmen named.
Soeder has recovered his good hu
mor and was happy over the showing
of the prosecution. General Salomon
is confident of an acquittal and the
defense is generally satisfied that the
accusation against. Soeder will fall.
Vague promises are held out by the
prosecution that a sensation will be
sprung before the trial is ended, but
no definite line can be secured as to
what this will be outside of an al
leged confession of Soeder to a cell
mate of his in the County Jail.
E. Kistler. clerk at the United States
Hotel on Eddy street;. Dennis Collins,
assistant division superintendent of the
Union-street line, and Bernard Bolin, a
watchman at the Union-street barn,
gave unimportant testimony for the
prosecution. . ' ,
Her sister followed, and said that
Blaise and Soeder were patrons of the
restaurant three or four times a week.
Soeder always paid the bill, but be
yond a greeting he never entered into
conversation with her. On the night
of January 11 he took dinner there
alone, and appeared sad. She asked
what was the matter and he told her
that Blaise had been killed and show
ed her an afternoon paper containing
the account of the prime. Soeder stated
that his brother-in-law must have been
robbed and n^irdered, as he had about
$00 in his pockets.
Charles Vose, the gripman on the
Union-street line, who was riding on a
car' on the night of January 10 and
who is supposed to have seen Blaise
board the same car and dismount at
Taylor street, where he was met by
Boeder, proved considerable of a dis
appointment as an identification wit
ness. He stated that the man stand
ing at the lamp post on Taylor and
Union streets was facing the hill and
he could only get a "three-quarters"
view of him as the car went by. To
the, best of his knowledge and belief,
he said, the man under the lamp post
was the defendant, but when asked
on cross-examination if he was willing
to swear to this statement he said
"No."
SOEDER APPEARED SAD.
and 6:15 on the evening of January 10.

Louis II. Eaton gave his twenty

Mr. Eaton was assisted by Miss Mil

Rosekrans. tenor, who rendered Barn
by's "The Soft Summer Breeze," from
"Rebekah." in a voice of rare quality
and flexibility, and Samuel Savannah,
violinigt, who played Max Bruch's ro
manze. op. 42, and Philip Scharwen
ka's "Legends" with superb effect, the
organ accompaniment- by Louis Eaton
being in the organist's finished style.
One of the gems of the recital was
Eaton's masterful and shading inter
pretation of William Faulkes' theme,
varied, in G major. His playing of !
Johann Sebastian Bach's fantasie and
fugue, in G minor, the first number on
the programme, prepared the assem
blage for the great things that were
to follow. Louis Boellmann's "Priere
a Notre Dame," from "Suite Goth
ique," was splendidly played. All the
numbers were given with fine effect.
Mr. Eaton received many congratula
tions at the close of the recital.

When the detectives called at 1309
Broadway Mrs. Strinkorb wa,s not in \
her room. They waited till she re
turned, carrying in her hand a suit
case. She had pawned her Jewelry and j
was attired in a complete new outfit, {
the clothes she had worn when leaving
her husband's house being found in a
closet in her room. She was brought
across the bay to police headquarters, |
and when questioned by Captain Mar- |
tin she said that the soldier she had j
loved before meeting her husband had j
died, but she declined to say when or !
where. She said she lived unhappily j
with her husband and had the inten
tion of committing suicide when she
left her home, but she met Parsons on
his car and he advised her against it.
He provided a room for her in a re
spectable house on Friday night and
on Saturday went with her to Oakland. )
She had obtained a good job there and i
would not return to her husband. Her
only regret was at leaving her baby.
Mrs. Nettie Strinkorb, wife of Fred
Strinkorb, beer bottler, 3936 Sacramento
street, who left her home on Friday
night after penning pathetic notes tell
ing o* her intention to commit suicide
by jumping off the rocks at Bakers
Beach, was found in Oakland j-esterday
afternoon. The supposition that James
Parsons, motorman on the Eddy street
line, knew of the woman's whereabouts
proved correct. The police learned that
she and Parsons went across the bay
Saturday morning and engaged a room
in a lodging-house at 1309 Broadway.
P&rsons explained to the landlady that
Mrs. Strinkorb was his sister-in-law,
and she reglstred under the name of
Nettie Parsons. On Saturday afternoon
she obtained employment in a restau
rant at 1227 Broadway and remained
there till 8 o'clock that night.
Great Interest Is attached to the pro
ceedings of the river convention that
â¢will, be held in this city May 23. This
ha* been etimulated largely by publi
cations in the papers of the mountain
counties and in the Sacramento Valley
tn which the agency of mining is fill
ing up the river beds has been discuss
ed Tilth more or less vigor.
An impression has been created, at
le&Et In some quarters, that there will
b# something said on the floor of the
convention concerning gold mining by
th* dredger process. As a result of
this a committee that embraced a large
chare cf the more influential members
cf the California Miners* Association
paid a visit last week to Oroville and
made a personal inspection of the oper
ations of the dredgers and also of lands
above and below the places where the
.'dredgers are used. The committee was
accompanied by Colonel Heuer of the
California Debris Commission.
The California Miners* Association
â¢rill be represented on the floor of the
river convention, so declares Secretary
Benjamin, by a delegation numbering
twenty. In the call for the convention
ell crganizatk-ns of a semi-public sort
were invited to take part. The Cali
fornia Miners' Asocintlon addressed a
letter to the Sacramento Chamber of
Commerce and set forth that the asso
ciation had taken a leading part In
having work done on the Tuba River
for the purpose of restraining the de
bris from flowing down the stream. I
In return a letter was received from
the Sacramento Chamber of Commerce
In which the miners' association was
requested to send representatives to
the convention. If nothing is said about
tnining on the floor of the convention
the miners will have no presentation
\-j make. But a report has been pre
pared as a result of the visit of the
committee of the association to Oro
viUe and vicinity and this will be
ready if any question is publicly raised
' concerning the effect of dredging for
gold in streams that flow into the Sac
ramento River.
â¢ The committee on invitation and ar
rangements has invited each reclama
tion district to send two delegates to
the river convention. These delegates
will be admitted to the convention upon
presentation of a certificate signed by
the president and secretary of the re
clamation district. All intending dele
gates are requested to send notice to
Edward P. Antron, secretary of the
committee on invitations and arrange
ments.
Academy of Sciences Hall was
crowded to the doors last night 'by a
representative gathering of the leading
dentists of the State at the first of the
evening sessions of the State Dental
Association. Owing to the absence of
Dr. D. D. Smith of Philadelphia the
reading of his paper on "Alveolar
Pyorrhea; Its Cause, Sequela and
Cure" was deferred until this even
ing.
Leander Van Orden, M. D., president
of the State association, delivered a
most interesting address on the his
tory of dentistry In California for the
last thirty years. He paid a tribute
to Dr. Smith's great work in perfect
ing a system of polishing teeth to such
a degree that decay can be reduced to
a minimum. He explained that by Dr.
Smith's system teeth were given a
polish impervious to the action of
starchy foods. Dr. C. L. Goddard
spoke on ; dental education, and Jo
seph D. Hodgen, D. D. S., gave a most
interesting talk on radium, illustrating
his remarks with $600 worth of the
wonderful metal.
The clinics will be continued to-day
in the surgical room In the Donohue
building and this evening the second
of the evening sessions will be held in
the Academy of Sciences Hall.

much attention. A manufacturers*
department was set apart and pre
sided over by both Eastern and West
ern dentists. ,
Members of the California State
Dental Association and the Alumni
Association of the dental department
of the University of California, who
have joined in arranging the con
clave, say that it has started under
more favorable auspices than has any
clinic previously held here.
The Union Clinic, held in connec
tion with the thirty-third annual ses
sion of the California State Dental As
sociation, opened yesterday morning at
the infirmary of the dental department
of the University of California in the
Donohoft building. At 9 o'clock the
rooms were thronged with visitors
and shortly afterward the clinics com
menced. The operators were all
men of high standing in their profes
sion and the interest manifested was
Intense.
"The Incarnation," a review of the
sixth chapter of Dr. Orr's "Christian
View of God In the World." was pre
sented by the Rev. Robert Whltaker
before the Baptist Ministers* Associa
tion yesterday.
An interesting hour was passed by
the members of the Christian Church
Ministers' 'Association yesterday after
noon when they listened to Professor
J. G. Rodger of the University Union
of California, which is situated at Los
Angeles. ,â¢
Professor Rodger said the university
had been founded to carry on religious
educational work from a scientific
viewpoint and to help students to see
that the great fundamental truths of
science, instead of conflicting with the
great fundamental truths of religion,
are in harmony with them, as Her
bert Spencer contends.
Dr. James A. Chamberlain of the
First Congregational Church, Bacra
mento, delivered an address of a tech
nical character, entitled "The Social
Atonement," before the Congregational
Ministers* Association yesterday morn
ing.
The speaker held that the law of
suffering is the handmaid of progress.
He held that sensitiveness and suf
fering are essential to society's salva
tion and that the problems of the in
dustrial strife of to-day will be solved
when men become sensitive to every
injustice.
UNIVERSITY UNION.
The pupils come and go. Some are
seafaring men, others are travelers.
There are those who remain long
enough to get a grounding in thÂ« most
essential parts of an English educa
tion and the foreign pupils represent
almost every . nationality of the world.
The night school turns out youths
and men who become proficient in the
professions, said Professor MacDonald,
and he gave an account of those who
embrace the study of architectural and
mechanical drawing.
Then the ministers were informed of
the demand for those who study at the
night school, the employers of the city
believing that in them must be the
sort of material that makes the man
when they are willing to give up their
spare moments to receive an educa
tion.
Since July 1 last the number of
pupils enrolled on the Lincoln Evening
School books is 3300.
PROFICIENT STUDENTS.
When the professor made the state
ment that the ages of scholars attend
ing the evening schools range from 14
to 60 years of age there was surprise.
Not alone are elderly men eager to
improve themselves, but women of
years are known to drop in and seek
knowledge.
In one instance given by Professor
MacDonald, a gentle, elderly lady, de
sirous of knowing how to read and
write that she might herself peruse
and reply to letters from her grand
daughter instead of depending longer
upon her neighbors to 'perform thosÂ»
offices for her, came to a night school
and studied until she was able to read
and write of her own account.
"Night Schools" was the subject of
an address by Professor A. H. Mac-
Donald, principal of the Lincoln Even
ing School, before the Presbyterian
Ministers* Association yesterday morn
ing.
Professor MacDonald gave Informa
tion which most of the ministers ad
mitted was new to them, consequently
they were greatly interested to learn
of the benefits that accrue not alone
to the youths of the city but to adults
as well.
