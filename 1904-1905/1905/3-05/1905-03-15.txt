LONDON. March
14. â The death of
the Marquis of
Anglesey is much
regretted at Ban

despite his idio

gTeatly liked. The

closed as a mark

deceased.
In the short

ran through a
magnificent prop

in addition to his

the family estates.
Last summer the
crash came and it
â was found that the
Marquis' unsecur

over . J1, 250, 000. The Marquis had
since been living on the Continent on
an allowance made by his creditors.
His short career has furnished a suc
cession of sensations in society, in
cluding his extraordinary costly col
lection of jewels and clothes, his mar
riage to his cousin, the daughter of
Sir George Cbetwynd; their subse

for private theatricals and the enor

auctions at hiÂ« private theater for the
delectation of a few house parties,
and finally .the revelations j regarding
his extravagances. When the credi

The contents of one unlocked drawer
were alone valued at 235,000, while
among the crockery in the pantry was
found a rock crystal ewer recently
sold at auction for $21,000.

Noted Ohioan Is Perfecting an Inven
tion to Do Away With
Wheels and Ties,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CLEVELAND. Ohio, March U.â
Mayor Tom L. Johnson to-night told
of rapid transit in the future, as he
believed it would be, to members of
the Cleveland Civil Engineer Club at
their annual banquet. He predicted a
trip from Chicago to New York over
a sort of toboggan slide electric road in
two hours.
It has long been an open secret that
Johnson has been ambitious to perfect
a device for annihilating time in rapid
transit. For several years he has been
working on the hobby along strictly
original lines, until at last he has
reached a point in his plans where he
ventures to hint as to the method of
the invention.
'The engineer's work," the Mayor
said, "is one of the essentials of mod
ern life. For instance, do you think
we will be satisfied with a twenty-hour
schedule between New York and Chi
cago? By no means. Although wheels
and tracks will not allow a speed of
more than 200 miles an hour, I believe
that many of you in this room will
see the time -when two hours and bet
ter between the two cities will be com
monplace. That will be less than half
the speed of a cannonball. It can and
will be done much quicker th,an you
think.
"If we can control electricity and
make It do the work along a straight
line that it does now in a circle, when
used in what is known as a motor, we
will have the problem solved. And it
is far easier than we have heretofore
thought. Then people would be shot
across the continent in a sort of shuf
fle on slide rails, something like a
toboggan slide drawn by magnets. It
is an early event of the future."

DOMINICAN
CONVENTION
IS DOOMED
Democrats to Vote
Solidly Against
Treaty.
Necessary Two-Thirds Ma
jority Cannot Be Ob
tained in Senate.
President's Plan for a Financial Pro
tectorate Over the Island
Republic Fails.
WASHINGTON, March 14.â The dis
cussion of the Dominican treaty in
executive session of the Senate to-day
resulted in the drawing of party lines.
The Democrats who have been reported
as likely to support the treaty will re
turn -to the fold, it is said, and on both
sides of the chamber it is admitted
there is little prospect that the con
vention will be ratified.
The Republicans have, been depend
ing on sonje Democratic support and
have c"otmT?<J- as Â«_'ertaln the votes of
Senatore .McEnery and Foster of I-ouls
iana and Clarke of Arkansas. Sen
ator Gorman, the minority leader, gave
notice to-day that these Senators are
now pledged against the treaty, and it
was stated that Senator McEnery to
morrow will recall his telegram author
izing Senator Cullom to pair him for
the convention.
The depletion of the Republican
ranks by reason of the vacancies in
Missouri and Delaware, the absence of
Senator La Follette, who has not taken
the oath of office, and Senators Al
drich and Knox is felt greatly by the
Republicans who are striving for fa
vorable action on the treaty. A can
vass of the Senate has not developed
the two-thirds affirmative votes neces
sary, even counting all Republicans as
present or paired.
The affirmative and negative on the
treaty took on a decided partisan bias
to-day. Senators Morgan, Teller and
other Democratic Senators criticized
the administration severely. Fault was
found particularly with Commander
Dillingham for his action in taking
control of the port of Monte Crlsti.
So harsh was the criticism of the ad
ministration that Senator Spooner de
voted nearly a half-hour to a general
defense of the course of the Depart
ment of State.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA. Neb.. March 14.â Captain
George W. Kirkman of the Twenty
fifth Infantry, who was prominently
connected with the recent Chandler
scandal, is face to face with a crisis
unless, as is now rumored, he is ab,le
to bring potent influences to bear I
cure the acceptance of his resignation
from the array.
It appears to be the d^terminatiun at
the army authorities to 'give him no
chance to escape. A few days ago the
decision of Secretary Taft refusing ac
ceptance of his resignation was an
nounced. To-day an order was tssuM
for a new court-martial in his case,
which is to convene on March 21, when
a new set of charges arising out of the
recent scandal wiU.be filed against
him. This will mean the possible dis
solution of the former court-martial,
which was continued to May 10 r
der to allow Kirkman time to obtain
material depositions from the Philip
pines in support of his contention that
he Is insane. Among other things
Kirkman is accused of having left Fort
Niobrara, although under arrest and
entered a gambling-house at Vale- ne,
the post town.
Although the relations of KlrKnan
and Mrs. Chandler only date back to
last summer, more details of the scan
dal have been leaking out since the wtf
cide of the unfortunate woman. Cap
tain Ktrkman followed Mrs. Chandler
from the fort last autumn to Omaha
and New York, where, it is alleged, he
left her to pay a big hotel bill. He
was subsequently brought back to Fort
Niobrara under arrest. aftÂ«r having
undergone an examination as to his
sanity at Fort Jay, Brooklyn. Charges
were then filed against him and Mrs.
Chandler came to F<~vrt Niobrara as a
witness.
THRASHED BY CHANDLER.
J During her stay, it , is charged, his
relations with her were so flagrant .. a*
! to f attract attention from every onÂ©
there. A,, personal altercation occurred
between I/iÂ»utenpnt. Chandler and
Kirkman. in wh*eh Kirkman was

Bulkeley is expected to withdraw
from all the fraternities of 'which he
is a member, including the Golden
Bear, an * honor society to which he
was elected last term, for his services

The Bulkeley case received notice
from various professors to-day, who
referred to it in their classrooms, draw
ing the natural moral that is involved
in the affair. Â . ,
Professor Lewis of the physics de
partment said to his < lass that if the

electing worthy leaders, and less to
building .big "C*i," things would be in
better shape at the university. He re
ferred to the leadership of "Locomo

left college under a cloud, as another .

7EDERAL DISTRICT COURT
DECLARED TO HAVE ERRED
Supreme Court Decision Involving
Arrest of French Sailor in
San Francisco.
WASHINGTON, March 14. â The
Supreme Court, in an opinion handed
down yesterday, decided a case involv
lrg the commercial treaty of 1863 be
tween the United States and France, ,
and establishing the duration of the I
term of imprisonment of French sail- ,
orÂ« arrested in the United Spates on I
charges of insubordination aboard
their vessels.
Jean Francois Maisan was arrested
at San Francisco in 1903, at there- j
Quest of the French Consul General.
He was released from prison on a writ
cf habeas corpus, the district court
holding that he should be set free with
the departure of the vessel.
The Supreme Court reverses this
ruling and holds that the District
Court erred in discharging the defend- j
ant before the expiration of the two I
months provided for in the act of
Congress, and against the protest of
the French Consul General.
lIATE OF INAUGURATION

Argument Against Fourth

WASHINGTON, March 14. â It is
j expected that the next session of Con
gress will really take action on the
matter of holding the inaugurations of
Presidents at a later date than March
4. This subject is always broached
after inaugurations, but as frequently
dropped after a few months.
The chief argument for changing
fhe date Is the bad weather that usu
j ally sweeps down on the city on March
j4. Scarcely an inaugural passes that
| some man. of prominence does not die
from exposure at the ceremonies.

Burg, wife of Bartlett Burg, a million- \
aire realty broker of Chicago, arrived |
ln Denver on Friday with her daugh
ter Stella, 16 years of age, the latter
having been forced to come to Colorado
because of lung trouble. Shortly after ;
her arrival Mrs. Burg became insane
and her condition was such that she ;
was removed to the County Hospital.
She grew worse and had to be bound
in retention sheets.
The arrival of her husband to-day
revealed the story. Within a short
time recently Mrs. Burg lost her father,
mother and one child and the train of
afflictions, coupled with her daughter's
illness, proved too much for her. It is
hoped that a return to familiar sur
roundings will effect a cure.
Mrs. Burg is a member of Chicago's
exclusive set and a woman noted for
her beauty. Her husband, besides own
ing much realty in Chicago, has an ex- ;
tenEive brokerage business. The Burgs
live in the exclusive West Side district.
Should Mrs. Burg be no better after
reaching Chicago she will be placed in
a sanitarium.

KIRKMAN'S NEW YORK VISIT.
NEW YOR.K, March 14.â Captain
George W. Kirkman of the United
States army was a gruest at the
Grand Hotel in this city last Septem
ber. He was often seen In the dining
room with a handsome woman, fash
ionably dressed, answering the descrip
tion of Mrs. Bessie Chandler. They al
ways left the hotel together, and al
though Kirkman was on an extended
spree, the woman seemed devoted and
careful of her escort.
Manager L.angton of the Grand said
that he did not know Mrs. Chandler.
He said she did not register with Cap
tain Kirkman at the hotel last Septem
ber.
"Captain Kirkman still owes us mon
ey," aaid Manager Langton, "and he
did not settle any woman's bill."
The address given by Captain Kirk
man at the time of his arrest as his
residence in Brooklyn. 30 Flatbush ave

SEVEN YEARS
IN A TRANCE
Man in Honolulu Claims to
Be Victim of Experiment
of San Francisco Hypnotist
LEAVES FOR MAINLAND
After Consulting Doctor at
Island Port the Awakened
sleeper Takes Departure
Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, March 7.â Dr. Walter
Hoffman of this city was consulted the
other day by a middle-aged man, who
said hie name was David Charters and
that he had just awakened from a
sa*ren years' trance. He told the medico
the following yarn:
My name l 9l 9 David Charters and seven years
ayo a doctor in San Francisco who was prac
ticing hypnotism persuaded me to allow him
to use me as a subject. 1 foolishly acqutesced
being hard up at the time and desirous ol
earning a little money, and from time to time
was practiced on as a medium. The doctor
rapidly became expert ln the hypnotic art and
1 made an ideal medium. One clay he put me
under the influence of his power and I went
to sleep. Then a terrible thing happened. I
was never awakened. What became of the
doctor I do not know. Whether sudden death
prevented him from restoring me to my nor
mal condition or whether he purposely failed
to break the spell for the purpose of conduct-
Ing a frightrul scientific experiment I have no
means whatever of knowing. Perhaps he has
been watching my progress and noting it dur
ing the seven years in which I have walked
the world in a trance.
I have not been altogether asleep but have
been waking and sleeping, to put it that way.
Still I knew and felt that I wa* asleep all the
time. My mfmorji of events previous to seven
years ago entirely failed me. Yet I trans
acted business and married twice and raisod
two families ln my hypnotic state. In fact 1
lived, walked and had my bqlng in a trance.
I came to Honolulu early ln February and
stopped at the California House. One day I
met Dr. Hahns Brooks, the magnetic healer.
He told me I was asleep, and after working
on me for three or four days succeeded In
rousing me from my lethargy. My memory
has been completely restored to me and I feel
a new man and called on you to ascertain if,
in your opinion, the cure will be permanent.
After hearing the man's story and
being somewhat impressed with it. Dr.
Hoffman told Charters that if he would
call in the afternoon and bring a friend
with him he would make an examina
tion. The sleeper failed to put in an
appearance at vhe stipulated time, how
ever, and to-day Dr. Hoffman is
puzzling over the strangest case or the
biggest faker he has met with in his
professional career.
Since visiting Dr. Hoffman Charters
has taken his departure for the main
land, leaving the mystery of his al
leged trance unsolved. At the Cali
fornia House his fellow boarders
thought him a trifle "queer."

GOES HUNDRED
MILES AN HOUR
Southern Pacific Orders New
Locomotive That Will Rev
olutionize Transportation
BURNS LIQUID KIEL
Engine Can Travel 3000
Miles Without a Stop
and Is Very Economical
CHICAGO, March 14.â Three thou
sand miles without a stop and at the
rate of 100 miles or more an hour is
the capacity of a new type of locomo
tive which has been ordered by the
Southern Pacific Railroad. If it does
all that its makers promise for it, this
locomotive, which is a revision of the
L>issel engine, will revolutionize trans
portation.
The locomotive, or really power
house on wheels, is entirely different
from anything in use. The cost of op
erating it will be less than one-haif
of the cost of operating the present
type of steam engine. Fuel oil coating
but 3 or a cents a gallon is the only
fuel that has to be purchased and there
is no necessity for erecting and main
taining expensive water tanks or coal
chutes.
The machine is what is known as the
four-stroke cycle. There is a com
pressed air reservoir, from which the
power is obtained for starting. This
gives the piston its first stroke, when
it takes Â«in the air alone at atmos
pheric pressure and temperature. The
second stroke compresses this air and
raises it to a temperature of about
1000 degrees Fahrenheit. The third
stroke is what is known as the work
ing stroke. The oil is sprayed into the
hot air, the amount being regulated by
governors. During the first part of
this stroke the combustion of this oil
Is carried on at a constant pressure
for a period that is regulated by the
amount of oil sprayed. The second
part of the stroke is practically an ex
pansion, with transference of heat, and
the fourth stroke exhausts the gases.
PRICES OF LINOLEUM
ARE TO BE ADVANCED
Manufacturers Say That Increased
Cost of Jute Compels Them to
Ask More Money.
NEW YORK. March 14. â Leading
manufacturers of linoleum have
agreed, says the Journal of Commerce,
to advance all inlaid goods 10 per cent
end all printed goods 20 per cent, the
increase to take effect on all goods
manufactured from to-day. Present
stocks will be sold at the old prices
between now and May 1, after which
nothing will be sold except at the new
figures. This action has been prompt
ed, the manufacturers explained, by
radical advances in the cost of raw
material. Ju'.?, which, in the form of
burlap, forma the principal lngre
i dient in the manufacture of linoleum,
I is at the highest price in over a de
; cade.
MYSTERIOUS DEATH IS

The dead man, who was 60 years
old, was senior member of the firm of

NEW YORK, March 14â A young

who says she came to thi3 city from a
Connecticut town a year ago. has been
found dying of starvation in a amail
room of a Harlem tenement-house.
With her was a baby. S months old.
Quick consumption has seized the
young mother and she can live only a
few days, but she refuses to tell the
name of her parents.
Neighbors notified the police when
they learned of her pitiful state. < >n- ,
who did not know that she was in
such dire need, had daily left a carl of
condensed milk for the baby. The girl
says that she shared this and that was
all the nourishment she had in twenty
days. The infant was emaciated and
weak, but it is believed it can be saved.
The girl would only say she came hers
and fell in with bad companions. Un
able to work she had pawned every
thing of value and finally became too
ill to leave her bed. An effort Is being
made to locate her parents in New
England.

TIE PASS, March 14.â As after the
battle of Liaoyang. the advance of the
Japanese army against me new posi
tions of the Russians at Tie Pass is
vtry slow. The leading columns are
eight or ten miles southward and in
touch with the Russian van posts, but
the operations at present are not seri
ous. Field Marshal Oyama shows
slight intention of pressing his ad
vantage in an immediate attack on
Tie Pass. It is possible, however, that
a vide turning movement, of which
reports are current, is in progress. In
puch operations the Japanese have the
immense advantage of several bases
and lines of supplies, to which is now
added the Sinmintin road, while the
Russian army necessarily is dependent
on one base and one line at communi
cation and therefore may easily be
outranked. t'"~-*3*
In ttie Grand army order is being
brought out of chaos with remarkable
celerity. The plain in front of Tie

a nest of ants with the dense and co-n

All of the newspaper correspondents,
; with the exception of - three or four,
' have left for the north, because there
i are here no accommodations and noth

of the Russian officers are in a surly
mood, and much of their grudgingly
i given Information is colored with Jeal
! ousy and the rampant spirit of cabal.
It is, however, possible now to give a
I general view of the battle, the con
nected story emerging out of the con
fusion incident to the evacuation of
Mukden and the forced retreat to Tie
i Pass.
STORY OF THE BATTLE.
On February 24 all was ready for an
attack on the westward. Various por
tions of the army had been disposed
for an advance on the right flank. Sud
denly, In the evening of that day, the
order to advance was canceled and a
second order was given for the transfer
of General Reunenkampff's First Si
berian Corps and several other organ
izations to tho left flank, which was
being pressed heavily by a large force
of Japar."se.
From that time forward the Japan
ese, who were well informed as to all
the Russian movements, began heavy
attacks along the whole front. The
Russians generally held their ground,
doinjr well until February 2?, when an
unexpected attack developed in the
southwest, before which the Russian
right, weakened by the withdrawal of
almost two corps, yielded.
By March 1, it became evident that
the Japanese were moving around the
Russian right in five heavy columns,
and it became imperative to withdraw
the thin line from the southwest and
form a new line from the bridge across
the Shakhe River, parallel with the
railway. The change of front was ac
,she<l with remarkable celerity,
but the various organizations becanie
badly mixed.
The Russians on March 4 occupied'
their former positions on the Shakhe
River as far as the bridge, thence to
Madyapu, on the Hun River, and
thence parallel with the railway, six
miles distant, the right resting on the
Sinmintin road. The Japanese on
March 5 beginning to turn even this
position with a view to cutting off
the retreat, the Russian right was ex
tended eastward from the Sinmintin
road to the railway.
On March 7, both sides began most
vigorous offensive operations, the Jap
anese attacking with energy the forces
of General Tserpitsky, which were
holding the position from Madyapu as
far as the heights east of Mukden sta
tion, while the Russians under Genera!
Gerngross began an attack in the di
rection of Tatchekiao and on the north
ern front General Launitz's command
beat back all Japanese attack?.
RUSSIAN CAPTURE GINS.
On the whole the outcome of the
fighting on March 7 was favorable t.>
the Russians, who repulsed several at
tacks on their southern front and as
iumed the defensive <>n the left, where
General Linevitch's army, occupying
eastern hill positions, repulsed numer
ous attacks and took several hundred
prisoners and several machine guns.
The continued extension, however, of
the Japanese lines northward and the
concentration which their superiority
;n numbers enabled them to effect
against the northern and northwestern
fronts rendered advisable a contraction
of the Prussian lir.es, and withdrawal
from the Shakhe River to positions on
the Hun River was determined upon.
This- was in no sense the beginning of
tho general retreat and Kuropatkin
and the generals commanding the
armies were far from regarding the
battle as lost.
The first army to retire from the for
tified positions east and southeast of
Mukden was the Third Army, which
Mtck to positions similarly fortified
in advance on the north bank of the
Hun River. The burning of abandoned
stores, provisions and forage disclosed
the Russian retirement, and the Jap
anese followed closely. A confusion in
orders and retirement in impenetrable
darkness across the country were re
sponsible for the failure of some or
ganizations to occupy the positions to
which they had been assigned and a
remarkable duststorm the following
day made it impossible to verify the
alignment and fill the breaches, which
the Japanese, however, were lucky
enough to find and skillful enough to
turn to their advantage.
KUROPATKIN LEADS ATTACK.
The Russian positions now formed a
boot, the toe at Madyapu and the heel
â  -p. the Hun River at Fushun, about
five miles wide; and to meet the ap
: areiu danger that the Japanese might
i'lug the top of the boot, Kuropatkin
sent thither forty battalions from the
command of General Miloff, which
were rendered available by the short
ening of the line.
The Russians began to slowly force
the Japanese back at this critical
point, but the Japanese in turn were
reinforced on their extreme right, and
General Kuropatkin, seeing all appar
ently going well at the other positions
and determining to stake all on a de
cisive blow, collected the remainder of
the strategic reserves, strengthened by
several other units, and led them per
sonally on March 9 to the north front
and threw them on the flank of the
Japanese, who were attacking San
taitze and endeavoring to cut the rail
way.
The scale of weight was on the Rus
sian side. The Japanese then retired,
abandoning a battery of eight guns,
sue/ess apparently crowning the Rus
sian arms.
At this moment two sets of reports
were received, the first that a column
of Japanese was moving farther north
around the right flank and the second
that the Japanese on the Hun River
had taken advantage of the storm
which was blowing the dust in the
Russians' faces, and of the breaches
in the positions on the Hun to thrust
a column through at Fu Pass and
Kyouzan, on the instep of the boot.
Here the fords were defended by only
three companies of the Barnaul Regi
ment and a company of the Irkutsk
Regiment, which were forced to retire
before Japanese cavalry and four
mountain guns.
With the entire Russian strategic re
serves already engaged, it became im
possible to meet the danger in these

two sources, which was imminent and
critical, and at S o'c'.ock in the eveninir
the order to retire to Tie Pass war.
given.
Thrr ugh the narrow boot-leg passage
scarcely five miles wide, a densely
packed mass of transports pressed
northward, coming under the fire of a
small squadron of Japanese cavalry
and four mountain guns, which earlier
in tae battle had managed to dart
across the Russian line of communica
tion and conceal themselves in the
mountains to the eastward. The force
of General Tr-erpkzky began an orderly
retirement from the boot toe and dur
ing March 10 General Kuropatkin suc
cessfully held at bay the Japanese who
were trying to reach the railroad.
On the night of March 9 Mukden
station presented a remarkable scene.
Shortly after it o'clock came the order
to complete the evacuation of the
station and city, with directions that
movements of trains northward must
be completed by 5 o'clock in the morn
ing. The enormous task was com
pleted in nine hours, including the
hasty embarkation of the wounded
who crowded the station and occupied
the hospitals. Many had already left in
the morning when the private trains of
Kurcpatkin, Kaulbars, Sakharoff, Bil
derling and Zabclin departed, but
thousands remained.
At i'.iO p. m. the first string of eight
trains was dispatched ana a call was
sent to Tie Pass for thirteen locomo
tives. The forwarding of these loco
motives without interrupting the
northward movement of trains was a
delicate piece of train dispatching, but
the overworked railroid staff accom
plished it successfully. At 3 a. m. the
second string was started northward,
and at 9:45 a. m. the last train of the
third string of sixteen departed. All
the trains had fifty-two to fifty-five
cars. ,
ARTILLERY SHIPPED OUT.
Three trains contained the ammuni
tion of the park of artillery which had
been dispatched the evening before in
540 cars: another train carried warm
clothing; one was coal-laden; one was
loaded with Red Cross supplies; one
with engineers' depot supplies; three
with commissariat freights and the re
mainder with wounded. The last train
out was the service train, with all the
employes of the railway, property and
station papers. Â»
The skill, exertion and devotion of
this little band of civilians rendered
service the importance of which can
not be overestimated for the future of
the Russian army. It saved thousands
of wounded soldiers, an immense
amount of ammunition and millions
of dollars' worth of property and cash.
'It must be remembered that five
miles north of Mukden an unceasing
fight was in progress. Trains earlier
had been bombarded with shimose
shells, and the railroad was twice
damaged. The trains traveled unlight
ed and without whistling, under eight
miles headway. All about fires blazed
in a gigantic ring of burning straw,
coal, wood, corn and biscuits. Occa
sionally boxes of cartridges exploded
with a disagreeable dry rattle, or
rockets rose and burst into clusters of
stars. The flames had plenty of ma
terial, as there were over 3600 carloads
of corn and biscuit and over 323.000
cubic feet of coal, straw and millet.
This was the only reserve commissariat
and other stores that were destroyed.
The wounded crowded the station,
filled every vacant place in the cars
and the brakebeams, buffers and roofs
were occupied, whiJe others were hang
ing to the steps.
The last train pulled out as General
Tserpitsky's troops began to pass the
station, shortly before the explosion
which wrecked the Hun River bridge.
On the platform remained eight tele
graphers who had volunteered to stay
at their keys until the arrival of the
Japanese.
In the hospitals of the Livonian Di
vision of the Red Cross and medical
fetaff were 1050 severely wounded. In
cluding- 364 Japanese, the Chinese
Governor of Mukden giving his word
to defend them until Mukden was oc
cupied by the Japanese. How many
wounded reached the station after its
evacuation is not known.

ST. PETERSBURG, March 15. â
The war council held at Tsarskoe-
Selo yesterday, at which War Minis
ter Sakharoff, General Dragomlroff
and others were present, is understood
to have decided affirmatively the ques
tion of continuing the war. Ways and
means were discussed, but decision on
some points, it is understood, was re
served.
A semi-official denial was given out
to-day of the reported recall of the
Russian second Pacinc squadron.
A bold way out of the perplexities
of the present situation has been sug
gested, namely, that Emperor Nicholas
travel in state to the ancient capital of
â¢ Moscow, summon the nobles and lead
j ing members of the Zemstvos around
him in the sacred precincts of the
Kremlin, frankly lay the situation be
! fore them, publicly pledge his word for
the execution of the projected reforms
and make a stirring personal appeal
through them to the people to loyally
rally to the support of ihe Russian
arms and co-operate in prosccu r ing the
war to a successful ternfma' ' -n
Such a personal appeal from toe sov
ereign undoubtedly would have a pow
erful effect throughout the country and
for the dynasty would have aa ad
vantage over the plan of submitting
the question of "peace Jr war to the
Zemsky Sebor which some of Ihe news

ity and trie increasing boldness of the

some of which are threatening ami
others even malting attempts at
armed uprising, as in Georgia.
Finland, the Xovoe Vremya de
clares, is arming; Jews everywhere
are fanning the flames of revolution,
and the danger of the agrarian move
ment is increasing.
Criticism on the conduct of the war
has been apparent in the newspapers
and has been aggravated by General
Kuropatkln's defeat and is now of the
most 'outspoken character.

WHERE IS KAWAMURA?
Question That Is Yet Puzzling the
Russian General Stutf.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 14.âAc
cording to the informa.tion received by
the War Office the remnants of General
Kuropatkin's army have made good
their retreat, and are now out o-f the
immediate danger of a new turning
movement north of Tie Pass. The
Japanese are reported to be completely
exhausted by their long, hard nght
and are compelled to rest and under
take the tasks of burying their dead
and looking after their wounded, pris
oners and plunder.
The War Office admits, however, that
Kuropatkin has not supplied specific
information as to the whereabouts of
General Kawamura, who is reported
to be northeast of Tie Pass, or the
Japanese columns, reported to be push
ing northward by forced marches west
of the railroad.
Kuropatkin also has left the War
Office in the dark in regard to the num
ber of prisoners captured by the Japa
nese, having m?de no detailed report
about the separate units. Therefore,
the general staff is in no position to
contradict the Tckio dispatch detailing
the Russian losses.
While Kuropatkin has assumed full
responsibility for accepting a battle at
Mukden, he has complained to the
Emperor that his plans miscarried
miserably through the failure, of two
generals, whose names cannot be
learned, to execute his orders. He also
throws blame on some of the troops,
which failed to respond properly at the
critical moment.
ARE NOT GOOD MARKSMEN.
Neither Russian Nor Japanese Expert
With the Rifle.
WASHINGTON, March 14. â Au
thentic advices received in Washing
ton by observers of the campaign in
Manchuria indicate that the small
arms fire of both armies is poor. The
artillery Â«fire on both sides 13 good,
but better with the Japanese than
with the Russians, although the lat
ter have the better ordnance. The
frequent hand-to-hand fighting, ne
cessitating the use of the bayonet, is
attributed to the inaccuracy of the
small arms fire and to the practice of
the Japanese of attacking at night.
The famed bayonet facility of the
British ?oldier had no chance In the
youth African war because the Boers
were such deadly marksmen.
Army officers interested in the de
velopment of marksmanship, not only
in the Unite* states regulars, but in
the ifiilitia and among the great body
of civilians who in time of war would
have to supply the bulwark of the na
tional defense, have taken pains to
ascertain something about the marks
manship of the Japanese and Russian
soldiers'.
Artillery firing is much more of a
mathematical problem than small
tfrms firing, the range being deter
mined by thÂ° mechanical contrivance,
while the rifle is solely dependent upon
the good eye and steady hand of the
individual soldier.
MANY ARE SURRENDERING.

ceived to-day from headquarters in the

"In the direction of Singching our

Tpon the Payment of
an Enormous Indemnity
PARIS, March 14. â Inquiry to-day
at three banks principally interested
In the new Russian loan broufht thÂ»
response that it had been decided to
postpone the issue. A represent
of one of the banks said the post
ponement was for such an indefinite
period that it was unlikely the issue
could occur for some time to come.
The postponement was attributed to
the uncertainties of the war situation.
The Tern as says:
It was quite natural that the Paris ban tars
should refuse to sign a contract In vi#w of
the conditions !n Manchuria and the Ignorance
of the financiers concerning the realities of
the Russian Government.
The paper declares the postpone
ment will continue until Russia's in
tentions become clear.
The Journal dcs Debats. In Its fin
ancial article, says:
Many people attribute the postponement to
the evidence that Russia haa reached the end
of her resources.
LONDON, March 15.â A revolt of the
French bankers is considered by the
London newspapers as the moat hope
ful and important news of the day,
promising an early conclusion of peats
between Russia and Japan. Apparent
ly the proposed loan nas not been ab
solutely refused, but only "postponed."'
This, however, is regarded here aa be
ing tantamount to a refusal, and is ex
pected to speak louder to the Russian
war party even than Kuropatkin's re
verse at Mukden. It is the general
belief that by the death of Germain,
the late Governor of the Credit Lyon
nais, Russia lost her strongest finan
cial friend in France, and that had
he been still alive no difficulty would
have been experienced. Wtth the
American and English markets closed
to her it is thought that Russia can
only turn to Germany, which is not
likely to be much more responsive than
(vance. and the only alternative would
seem to be to make peace.
Reports are current here that Japan
will now demand an indemnltv of be
tween $500,000,000 and $750,000,00Â©.

GETS A REPORT
FROM REYNOLDS
Attitude of Burnett Toward
Stanford Mystery Is Not
Changed by Information
MEX STILL AT WORK
Captain of Detectives Has
by No Means Abandoned
the Theory of- Poisoning
Captain Burnett received five cable
grams from Honolulu yesterday from
Detective Reynolds, and although he
would not divulge their^ contents he had
no change to make in his opinion as to
the probability that Mrs. Stanford was
poisoned. The cabled press reports are
conflicting concerning the develop
ments since Detectives Reynolds and
Callundan began their investigations, it
being msde to appear that the verdict
<f murder the Coroner's jury, arrived at
was becoming discredited.
The head of the city's detective de
pertment does not seem to have under
gone any change of mind, however,
Â«fter receipt <Â»f the official report from
hi* subordinate yesterday. He has
nothing to say in criticism of the police
department of Honolulu nor of the
Coroner's jury that sent to the world
.- definite conclusion that Mrs. Stan
ford had been p<riÃoned.
In any event," said captain Burnott,
it certainly look? that an attempt at
leaet was made to take the life of Mrs.
Stanford, both at Honolulu and in this
Whether or not we shall feel able

nolds and Oallundan return from the

Testimony and evidence.'
The captain makes careful study of
all dispatches in the public prints in his
hunt for information, but no policy is
to be shaped, he saysÂ«. except on the
official report? Hp receives. He an
nounced last night that he regarded
the investigations at a standstill fir
thÂ« time being at thfp end.
"We have covered the field thor
<-Â»ughly in the iipht of all the informa
tion in our possession." he said.
Every person who could possibly shed

TUCSON, Ariz., March 14.â A party
<>f three hundred mon gathered
hastily by Filomeno Vasquez, mu
nicipal president of Suaqiii Grande on
the Yaqji River, from the residents
and ranchers about that town, has suc
ceeded in doing what a force of Mexi

A band of Yaqui Indians raiding
ranches in the neighborhood of Tecori
pa. Oobache and surrounding towns,
and carrying off their plunder to their
hiding plate in the mountains, has
been tracked to their lair and utterly
routed. Meager reports of the fight
have reached Hermosillo according to
auvices from that city.
The raiders have been carrying on
their nefarious work for nearly a
month, dodging every force sent out
against them. The Suaqut Grande
party surrounded them at daybreak
last .Saturday. having advanced
stealthily on their camp during the
night. The battle was short. The

complished. Detective Reynolds says
it is unlikely that any definite con
clusion will be reached here as the in
dications are very strong that the de
tectives' work is tending v* a result en
tirely different fro?.i that arrived at by
the Coroner's inquest.
That Mrs. Stanford died a natural
death probably will be the conclusion
of those who are now investigating
the oast. President Jordan of Stan
ford I'niversity emphatically expresses
the opinion that Mrs. Stanford's death
was not due to strychnine poisoning.
He says that when he became familiar
with her symptoms he reached that
conclusion. He is a doctor of medi
cine and says that since he has learned
that the amount of strychnine taken
by Mrs. Stanford was not beyond a
medical dose, he is more sure than
ever that she was not poisoned. Dr.
Jordar has been assisting the detec
tives to the extent of suggesting ques
tions', an a physician, during their
Inquiries regarding her symptoms and
the results of the autopsy.
The Territorial Senate to-day decid
ed to adjourn at 2 o'clock to-morrow,
and the Senators will attend the fu
neral of Mrs. Stanford in a body.
In the House Representative Coel
ho offered a resolution that the House,
following the lead of the Senate,
should adjourn out of respect to the
memory of Mrs. Stanford and that the
Representatives should attend the fu
neral in a body. Representative Hol
stein objected. He said that while all
due respect should be paid to the me
mory of the great benefactress the
House had much work before it, and he
proposed a substitute resolution that
a committee of three members should
be appointed to attend the funeral
ceremonies.
Representative Coelho declined to al
low his resolution to be the subject
of dtecusston and withdrew it.
J. F. Hackfeld, who now represents

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 15, 19U5.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
SACRAMENTO, MarWh 14.â ThÂ«
Tuesday Literary Club, made up of
nearly 400 of the best-known women in
Baxrantento, is divided, and many un
kind things are being said on both
sides. The differences arose over the
election of U president to succeed Mrs.
H. B. Brackenfeld, who declined to
serve In that capacity for another term.
At the last meeting of the club, at
which nominations were in order, Mrs.
U. A. Lindley and Mrs. G. H. Mc-
Laughlin received the highest number
of votes and were therefore declared
candidates for the office of president
at the election to be held Tuesday next.
Mrs. Mclaughlin declined to run and
the point was raised in the case of Mrs.
.Lindley that she had not been a mem
ber of the club one year, as required by
the by-laws. Mrs. Breckenfeld, the
president, ruled, however, that Mrs.
Lindley had previously been affiliated
with the club for the. required period,
although she had subsequently re
signed, and she was declared eligible
for election.
This decision did not give general
satisfaction, and it soon became ap
parent the women were arraying
themselves on one side and the other.
Those who favored Mrs. McLaughlin's
candidacy nominated Mrs. C. N. Post,
wife of the Deputy Attorney General,
for president.
The meeting at which this was ac
complished was rather a stormy one
for a literary club and not a few per
sonalities were indulged in. It was
even said that a fight was being waged
by those who favored turning the
management over to the society ele
ment and subordinating those who did
not care for pink teas and dances. On
the other hand, it was alleged that an
effort was being made by those who
favored building a' new clubhouse
even though literature was given a
back seat, to oppose the will of the
more- conservative ones who thought
the club should stick to Shakespeare
and Milton and let the clubhouse proj
ect go.
Another meeting was held in secret
late this afternoon and it was not
more pacific than the others. It de
veloped that some of the women had
appealed to Superior Judges J. W.
Hughes and c. C. Hart with reference
to the eligibility of Mrs. Lindley as a
candidate. Others had laid their case
before Clinton L. White, a prominent
attorney, while the wife of C. H.
Dunn, a weir known lawyer and pres
ident of the Law and Order League,
was armed with no end of legal au
thorities. The two Judges held that
Mrs. Lindley was eligible, while the
lawyers disagreed. It was finally de
cided that Mrs. Lindley and Mrs. Post
should remain candidates for presi
dent.
It was late when the women went
home to cook their husbands' dinners
and the dove of peace could scarcely
have been said to have spread its
wings over the rival factions.

Horror of Slocum Disaster Is
Repeated in Yesterday's De

ed Gotham Tenement House
MANY EOASTED ALIVE
SEEKING SAFETY
Rescuers Take Thrilling
Chances in Daring Efforts
to Save Panic-Stricken Oc
cupants From Awful Death
NEW YORK, March 14.â Nineteen
persons dead, twoscore Injured, some
so seriously that they may die, and
nearly 200 persons temporarily home
less, 1b In brief the story of New York's
latest fire horror. The victims of the
disaster were typical EaÂ«t Side people.
The scene, a typical tenement, and thÂ«
sceneÃ attendant on it were scenes com.
mon to that cosmopolitan quarter. To
apparently reckless heroism shown by
firemen, policemen and volunteer res
cuers alone is due the fact that the
number of dead is not greater.
The identified dead:
Sarah Kline, aged 60; Bella Zeidler,
aged 30: Harry Zeidler, aged 11; Rachel
Solomon, aged 46; Jacob Solomon, aged
16; Isaac Bolomon, aged 18; Jessie
Cohen, aged 15; Rose Weiner, aged 23;
Sander Weiner, aged 4; Ida Muskowita.
aged 10; Harry Kaufman, aged 10;
Rose Miller, aged 4; Morris Miller, aged
5 months; Oarson Fusehs, aged 30;
Rachel Zeidler, aged 12; Harris Zeidler,
aged 40.
Two hundred persons herded in the
big five-story double-decker tenement
house were sleeping, when flames from
an overturned or exploding kerosene
lamp in the basement spread through
out the structure and wrapped the en
tire building in flames almost before
an alarm had been sounded* Even
when the sleepers awoke, at the first
cry, it was almost too late, but hardly
more than* a moment was necessary to
show them that their troubles had
scarcely begun. The long, narrow iron
fire escapes which ran down the build
ing on each* of its exposed sides had
been made receptacles for rubbish of
all descriptions, and m many cases
they were little better than useless.
FIRE ESCAPES BLOCKED.
It was found also that every fire
escape platform on the building had
in It a "blind" or a square piece of
board which fits into the opening
through which the ladder passes in the
grated floor. The result of these ob
structed escapes was evident when it
was found that nearly all the dead
found on the top floor of the building
were roasted before they were able to
reach the ground. Another case of
negligence which was responsible for
the loss of some lives was an immov
able skylight at the head of a ladder
leading to the roof. Battened securely
and partially covered with Ice, this
skylight resisted all efforts to force it,
and a pile of bodies lay under it when
the horror was over.
The scenes about the building after
the fire and when the search for the
dead was begun, were heart-rending.
Nothing so pitiful of such propor
tions has been seen in New York city
since the Slocum disaster, in which a
thousand persons, nearly all of them
women and children, lost their lives.
The fire started in the basement oc- !
cupied by Isaac Davis, his wife and j
three children. Davis had been out :
last night and returned home early \
this morning, went into his store on '.
the same floor just in time to see a
kerosene lamp in the rear explode. He
awoke his wife and both tried to put
out the flaming lamp, but without sue- j
cess, and then gave all their attention
to getting their children out of the
burning building. A policeman who
heard the cry of alarm rushed to the !
scene, and every effort was made to (
arouse the sleeping persona in the !
house.
Lieutenant Bonner. son of a fdrmer |
fire chief, ascended a red hot fire |
escape five times. Four times he came
down with a woman or a child in his
arms. The fifth time he was making
for the street with an unconscious !
woman when his strength gave out. |
He staggered and would have fallen
to death had not a comrade come to I
his assistance.
As Bonner reached a fourth-story |
window on one of his ascents and
dragged a little girl from a window,
where she" stood surrounded by flames,
she pleaded with him to let her escape
and go in after her little brother, :
whom she had carried to the window.
He had fallen unconscious and was \
roasting, she said. Bonner jumped
through the window and it seemed to
those below as if he was going into a
furnace. He found the little boy just
Inside the window and carried him out. '
FLINGS BABE FROM WINDOW.
A baby was flung Into the arms of
a policeman below by its fear-crazed
mother. Just as the policeman caught
the child the mother dived to the
ground. Her body struck the police
man on the head and he fell uncon
scious. The woman escaped injury by
the fall, but she had been badly
burned. The baby was unhurt.
The desperate resourcefulness of
some mother, In her effort to save th#
lives of her children, wan shown when
a bundle was seen to fall from a high
window In the burning, and light gent
ly upon a heap of snow. In the center
of the bundle, wrapped around by sev
eral thicknesses of blankets and com
forters was found a 4-year-old boy,
who suffered not at all from his un
usual experience. The fate of the
mother is not known.
Nearly all the bodies taken fnom the
building were so badly burned as to be
almost unrecognizable.
Fire Chief Edward F. Crocker said
the loss of life was mainly due to de
lay in giving the alarm. Eight min
utes, he said, elapsed after the fire
started before the alarm was sounded.
He added that the fire-escapes were
shamefully clogged and that It was the
duty of the Tenement-house Commis
sion and the Police Department to see
that the law against fire-escapes' ob
struction was enforced.

RETREAT
OF CZAR'S
ARMIES
Continued From Pace 3, Column 4.
Of the military railroad all but 125
miles was abandoned and the wagon
ettes destroyed. Tens of thousands of
boxes of ammunition were abandoned,
but most important of all, from a ma
terial point of view, is the loss of the
Fushun coal mines which supplied the
ioad with coal.
The trans were heavily bombarded,
but came through safely.
The retirement of the wagon trans
port was twice imperiled by panic on
the morning of March 10. A Japanese
squadron and guns concealed in tile
mountains opened fire and the drivers,
who were undisciplined peasants, un
accustomed to the sound of shimose
shells, began to desert their carts and
wagons, cutting loose the horses or
throwing the stores from the wagons.
Confusion became rampant and spread
to terror-stricken civilians and even
gunners, and was communicated to
some infantry troops. The gray clad
crowd, without information, hidden by
dust, surged on. The Japanese, how
ever, soon ceased firing and order was
restored. Troops following the wagons
carried off two cannons, but were un
able to gather the abandoned property.
Soldiers broke open officers' boxes and
portmanteaus and ransacked them for
valuables.
Just before dark another panic oc
curred at the station of Santalse,
where an enormous collection of carts
had halted for the night. A column of
Russians advancing was taken for Jap
anese and the cry "Japanese cavalry!"
was raised. The unarmed drivers com
menced to flee, while those with rifles
fired in every direction. The cooler
heads quieted thÂ« panic-stricken mass,
but a number of lives were lost and
additional property was sacrificed.
The retirement of the central and
western armies was effected by four
roads and over the fields between.

by the fear that his wife had lost all
love for him, William Trebllcox, a
well-known miner, shot his wife at the
doorstep of their home in this city
to-day and wounded her cousin,
Charles Allen. Trebilcox told a friend
he * as going home to kill his wife and
anyone else who attempted to stop
h.m. He carried out his threat to the
letter.
Trebilcox had not lived at home for
several weeks. He had been drink
ing. It is said that he dragged his
wife around the house by the hair and
flic told him never to come into the
house again, that she never wanted to
see him again. Trebilcox took a trip
to San Francisco, and upon his re
turn he went to his home, but his
I wife turned a deaf ear to his appeals.
j H^r cousin, who was boarding with
them, also told Trebilcox that he was
not wanted at the house any longer.
Trebilcox left determined not to go
near the house again. The green
eyed monster got the better of him
tc-day. however, and taking 'several
drinks, he went to the house and de
manded admission. The cousin met
him at the door and asked him what
he wanted.
Trebilcox replied, "This is my house.
"Who is running this place anyway?"
Allen retorted, "I am." At this
Trebilcox drew a pistol as did Allen.
Mrs. Trebilcox rushed between the
men as Trebilcox fired. The bullet
.Firuck the woman in the face under
th* light eye, coming out at the base
of the skull. Allen ran as he saw the
woman fall, and Trebilcox fired two
fhws at rhe fleeing form. One took
* effect In the right thigh, severing one
of the large veins.
Stooping over and kissing his wife's
mangled and bloody face Trebilcox
looked around, then arose and strode
into town, the rmoking weapon in his
hand. ' Through the principal busi
ness street he went. People shrank
from him as he passed, the news of
â¢ the tragedy having preceded him in
to town.

nrrest and locked him in the city jail.
Hearing that a crowd of citizens was
about to march on the jail to lynch
thr murderer, the Marshal took Treb-
Jlcox around the back streets and
placed him on a car for Nevada City.
.He is now in the county jail.
When seen after the murder the
prisoner gave the details of the whole
â¢ affair. He stated that Allen had sup

SAYS KINIRY
LED SON AWAY
3fothers of Youths Charged
With Murder of Officer J.
H. Smith Face Each Other
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 14.
Intereet In the Kiniry murder trial
centered this afternoon on a scene en
acted by the mothers of the two youthÂ«
who are charged with being responsible
for the death of Policeman James
Hume Smith, whom they shot when
he placed them under arrest on sus
picion of iheir being burglars. For the
first time since the beginning of thÂ«
trial Mrs. J. L. Watson, the mother
of Kiniry, took her seat this afternoon
beside her son, now on trial for his
life. It chanced that Mrs. Kate Grein
er of Lop Angeles, the mother of Joe
Goldstein. Kiniry's pal, who was shot
and killed by the policeman, was called
as a witness, and the two women faced
each other, but a few feet separating
them.
The women stared at each other and
during her testimony Mrs. Greiner said,
pointing her finger at Kiniry, "He Is
responsible for the death of my son.
He led him astray and I ordered him
never to visit my houÂ«e any more."
The witness relatrd the circumstance
of her visiting Kiniry in the Los An
geles jail, and said, "I asked him why
he had phot the policeman and caused
my boy to be killed, and he never
looked at me." In the recital of her
story the witness became very much
agitated and broke down and cried and
for some time was unable to go on
with her testimony.
Mrs. Watson, Kiniry's mother, sat
rigid and resolute and held herself un
der control while she heard her son ac
cused before the juror 6 having his life
in their hands. She is a pronounced
blonde and under other circumstances
would be pleasant looking. She was
dressed in black to-day and wore a
thin biack veil. Those who sat close
to her say they heard her sigh and
that she did not trust herself to look
t<> the right nor left during the entire
ordeal.
Mrs. Greiner said her son and Kiniry
had associated together a great deal
while at Los Angeles and that she al
ways thought Kiniry's influence was
bad. When her son left her she laid
it at Kinirj-'s door and when he was
killed her fears were only proved to
have been too well grounded.
Mrs. Watson has not seen her son
in some years. He began to work for
himself when he was 11 years of age
and she married a second time and
went with her husband to Ohio, while
the boy was left in San Francisco,
where he entered upon a career of
crim*.
Captain J. H. Bradish. Detective Paul
E. Flammer and Policeman John S.
Hendrickson of Los Angeles told their
etories of the capture of Kiniry there
and were excuse^, and with Mrs. Grpin
er, will return to the southern city
to-night.
THINK MURDER
WAS COMMITTED
Coroner to Hold Inquest on
Remains of Woman Found
in the Ashes of Her Home
MARYPVILLE, March 14.â Coroner
Kelly will hold an inquest to-morrow
to determine the cause of the death of
Mrs. Joseph Nance, whose body was
found among the ashes of her home
Monday morning. While the belief Is
general that the woman was murdered
by her husband and that Nance set fire
to the house to hide his crime, there
is no absolute evidence to prove that
he committed the crime.
One witness has been found who
claims to have heard shots from the
direction of the Napce residence be
tween eleven and twelve o'clock Sun
day night. Others are willing to testify
that they have heard Nance make
threats to burn his wife to death. Mrs.
Petrte, a sister of Mrs. Nance, says
Nance, came to her house about eleven
o'clock Sunday night and asked for
matches, which were given him. The
next morning she says he appeared
from beneath the Petrle house, where
he had been asleep. Nance. It is said,
drove the Petrle children away from
his home Sunday evening when they
went there to visit their aunt.

OBDEBS RECEIVED

Breaking* of Their Paroles
by Several Officers of the
Ship Believed to Have
Caused Executive's Action
Special Dispatch to Tb* ; CalL
VALLEJO. March 14.â The plan* of
the Russian Government to have the
Russian cruiser Lena, which has been
lying at the Mare Island navy yard for
many months, repaired at thÂ« Union
Iron Works, San Francisco, have been
abandoned, as President Roosevelt
would not give the desired permission.
The work will be done at Mare Island
by the regular yard employes. This
news leaked out this evening and has
caused a great deal of comment here
and amonif the naval officers attached
to the yard.
The boilers of the Lena are to be
retubed, and the pumps repaired and
there is a great deal of other work. Two
months' time will be required to com
plete the repairs. A survey of the ship
has already been made and it Is ex
pected that the work will be com
menced at once and not at the end of
the war as was first thought.
It is believed here that the breaking
of their paroles by several of the of
ficers of the Lena has led the
dent to adopt this course, It being the
opinion of the Washington authorities
that it would be a risky and expensive
task to guard the several hundred men
who comprise the cruiser's crew at the
Union Iron Works.

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
PEOPLE ASKING WHAT WILL BE DONE FOR CITY
That Is Question at
Front After Bal
lot Count.
FUTURE DISCUSSED
Mayor - Elect Ex
pects the Help of
Every Citizen
OAKLAND. March 14.â The people of
Oakland have almost ceased to talk
about or speculate over the vote that
was caet at the municipal election yes
terday, and are turning their atten
tion to the question of what the Incom
ing administration will do for the city.
The people want something done, but
v. hat it shall be or how it is to be done
â¢ are Questions being passed up to the
new officials. It is only the future that
Is being discussed now, and what little
of election bitterness there was has al
ready been forgotten, so that the new
officers will enter upon their duties
with the best wishes of the public at
large.
The completion* of the count shortly
before daylight did not change the re
eults announced -this morning. Mayor
Frank K. Mott was given the hand
some -.vote of 5459, or nearly a* many
as all of his opponents combined, with
a. plurality over John L. Davie of 2260.
Mott carried every ward in the city of
Oakland and every voting precinct ex
cept four, two in the First Ward and
one each in the Second and Third
wards. This vote was a splendid tes
timonial of the standing of Mr. Mott
In the community. But the vote that
was given Mr. Davie in a single-hand
ed fight shows that he still has a hold
Upon a large number of voters.
A complete count of the votes for
City Attorney shows that J. E. McEl
roy was elected over Abe P. Leach by
a plurality of 591. This was largely
Cue to the fact that Mi McElroy had
made an excellent record during his
last term and the voters did not want
to change. . Both are young men and
both stand well in the community.
MOTT SELF-MADE.
Frank K. Matt is a self-made man.
He was born in San Francisco on Jan
uary 21. 1866. His family moved to
West Oakland, where he attended
school until he was 13 years of age.
hen. his father dying:, he decided to
gx> to work. He was first a messenger
iboy for the Western Union Telegraph
Company, and later became a clerk in
the office. He then entered the employ
of a hardware firm, in which employ
ment he went from the lowest to the
high- place. With a desire to be
come an employer he secured an in
terest in the hardware firm of E. A.
Howard & Co. in 1897 he purchased
the entire cusiness, changed the name
to the Frank K. Mott Company, and
Is to-day one of the most prosperous
and substantial business men of Oak
land. He has always taken an Inter
est in politics, and when Henry P. Dal
ton was elected Assessor, Mr. Mott
wae appointed to succeed him in the
Council by the then Mayor, George C.
Pardee. Twice after that Mr. Mott
was elected from his ward. His only
other political fight has . been the one
yesterday.
Mr. Mott is modest about what he
hopes to accomplish during his term
of office, and this is" what he says:
1 have made but one promise during my
campaign â that I will give the people the
ben that I have. This I shall do, but I
ehall also need the as?ictancÂ» of ?very rr.tn;
ber of the incoming administration. More than
that I shall need the help of every citizen or
this city, and I hope that it will be given me
.freely. I am interested in this city personally.
All the interests that 1 have are located right
here, and whatever \t done will affect m

EBELL ENJOYS
GOOD MUSIC
AT LUNCHEON
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE
O.AKLAND. March While the Ebell la
<:!<:Â« and their guests- stood about in little
groups at the conclusion of the programme to
; day. discussing the various numbers, I- over
heard one very critical woman say: .""Really 'it
was one of the beet programmes we've had,"
and her companions agreed enthusiastically.
The remark in iuÂ«lf was riot unusual, but the
ring of truth in it was. â  Ebell has been spoiled,
for artist.* who' had to give. ' have . givni their
btst to thie popular club and it must be 'some
thing very good that holds the satiated atten
tion of its members. Dr. Todd"s young daugh
ter, and son. with the assistance of Miss Beth
Howard, gave two surprisingly good violin
numbers. Miss Madeleine is somewhere in the
neighborhood of sweet sixteen,, and though
Master James is said to be thirteen, lie certain
ly doesn't look it. but these two talented young
people j played with a sureness of tone and a
reeling that I have oftrn looked for in vain in
older and more experienced musicians. The
Bach concerto called forth an encore, in â¢ re
sponse to which a waltz by Puchs was given.
Mrs. Olive Ke<-d Cushman's rich, beautiful
voice was beard in only two selections. Met
cait's exquisite little ballad "Until You Came"
and "The Slumber Boat," by Gaynor.
Mrs. Oscar Cushing" of San Francisco, bet
ter known to Oakland ers as Ina Griffin, con
tributed very materially to the musical pleas
ure of the afternoon. The entire programme.
was as follows:
Largo, ma non tanto, from concerto for two
violins (Bach;, Miss Madeleine Todd, Master
Jamet- Hamilton Todd, Miss Beth Howard,
pianist; ia) "Until You came" (Metcalf). <b)
"The Slumber Boat" (Jessie L.. Gaynor.. Mr?.
' ' i-hmÂ«n, Mrs. Arthur \V. MÂ«x)r*.
Â«nmt; i Â»\ Impromptu. <i flat (Cbof>tn);
:gs without word* (Mendelssohn); <c)
â¢ly. op T9, No. 2 (Brahms), Mrs. ns ar
K. Cu*l.mg.
The progrpmn-.e was under the supervision of
Mrs. J. Hamilton Todd.
One of the delightful features of the aftVr
noon was the talk on "Household Economics"
by Mr*.. Charles Woodbury â a dry subject, you
would nay. but in the hands of Mrs. Wood
bury, sparkling .with wit, scintillating with
satire ond clothed in beautiful language. She
Krasps her subject with masculine force and
handles it with feminine delicacy.
Mrs. Paul LÂ«ohse â who. by the way. seems

WINS THE DAY
University President's Wife
Successful in Preventing;
the Co-Eds' Trip Abroad
Berkeley Otfice San Francisco Call,
214S Center Street, March 14.
Mrs. Benjamin Ide Wheeler scored a
victory to-day when, in deference to
her opinion that it is not well for thirty
university co-eds" to travel abroad
giving theater performances, the â wo
men students in college decided to give
up their proposed trip to Bacramento.
A meeting of representative "co-eds"
and other prominent women connected
with the university had beer, called for
this morning in North Hall. Miss i^thel
lurhardson, head of the . Associated
Women Students, presided. Mrs.
Wheeler was present and spoke, as did
others, of the possible ills that might
result from a journey to Sacramento
by the "co-edf." such as was contem
plated to produce the "Mikado"' there.
There could be no mistaking tho sin
cerity and strength "f the university
president's wife's feelings regarding
the matter, and this was so evident to
the women students that the abandon
ment of the enterprise was at once
agreed to.
The entire question was supposed to
hinge upon the matter of c-haperones
for the "cvÂ»-*ds ' vhile on their journey,
but the women students made it plain
in resolutions they adopted that it ia
sol lack of chaperoneK but regard for
Mrs. Wheeler's feelings and opinion
that induced ihem'to forego the tiip
to the capital cit > .
The resolutions adopted were as fol

BILLIARD GAME
THEIR UNDOING
Hi<iii School Youths Suffer
Because of Infatuation
for Fascinating Pastime
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
-14s ("enter Street. March 14.
Three of the moat prominent mem
bers of the senior class of the Berke
ley High School have been suspended
by Principal James, pending action by
Superintendent of Schools Waterman.
which may take the foim of expulsion
for the trinity of offending pupils. The
students are Harold Parmenter. Scott
Martin and Elmo Steele. They were
caught by Principal James In a local
sporting resort last Friday, playing
games that are forbidden to school
boys, at certain periods of the day.
The fascinating game of billiards
proved the undoing of Parmenter,
Steele and Martin. They have become
infatuated with the pastime, it ap
pears, and for months have spent the
time that the school authorities declare
should bo utilized for study and recita
tion purposes Â«t the sporting resort in
question, where billiards and other
games are played. The lads were be
coming expei t at the game, and the
fondness each exhibited for the pas
time was bo marked as to attract the
attention of fellow school pupils.
The report was brought to the High
EtpfaooJ authorities during study hours
last Friday that the boys in question
OOUld be found then at the billiard
tables and Principal James promptly
descended upon the sporting enthus
iasts. He found the pupils as indi
cated and was left no choice but to
accuse thorn of violating a High School
rule, calculated to preserve discipline,
and promptly put them under the ban.
Their cases are now in the hands of
Superintendent Waterman.
Steele is right-end on the school foot
ball team, and prominent in other
ways. Parmenter mri Martin have
he^n interrpt<i<3 in school activities, so
that they are- among the best known
members of the school, and all are
rated as perhaps the most influential
trinity in the institution. Their suspen
sion created a sensation which has not
yet subsided.

BIG "C" STIRS
UP DISCUSSION
Poet Charles Keeler Thinks
Lovely Berkeley Needs No
Symbol on the Hills
STL DENTS IGNORE TALK
Plans for Building Great
Letter of Cement Go For
ward Despite Opposition
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2118 ("enter street, March 14.
People of the college town and all
the folk who have their habitat on the
university campu? are rapidly aligning
themselves in sections that stand in
favor of or are opposed to the build
ing of a gigantic "C" on Charter Hill,
back of the university. The sopoho
mores and freshmen are to build the
big. "C" out of cement. It is intended
to be a landmark, a college symbol,
the foundation of a Charter day tradi
tion, and in other ways it appeals to
the college man's love of an outward
and visible sign of his university life.
The poet, Charles Keeier, however,
and a small host of university pro
fessors and others, are strongly against
the big "C." Poet Keeler has long
stood for the "beautiful in Berkeley."
He issued a formal statement of his
opinions in this big "C" matter to-day,
following the example of Professors
Whitney and Gayley, who yesterday
besought the students to refrain from
"desecrating " Charter Hill with an
enormous university symbol.
Poet Keeler writes of the matter as
follows:
POKT HEELER'S PROTEST.
It is th* oruer ul the day thai < nnipetiticn
should be succeeded by combination, and so
it lM nut surprising thai we nnu the freshman
and sophomore students of the university plan
nine to supplant thÂ« time-honored Charter day
rush on the hills with a peaceab c Joint effort
at !>uDiiMiy. The novel plan, we are told,
is to place an immense cement "C on the
hillside, where it will be @een for miles around
and may stand as a symbol of conciliation
between freshmen and sophomores of Califor
nia, or more appropriately or plain Cement.
This brilliam .inception of a joint " t. ' has
been proposed in an effort to perpetuate a
tradition, while eliminating its proscribed
feature of rushing. Comparatively few of the
present day freshmen and sophomt>res who are
H eager to continue this tradition in amended
farm have any clear notion either of its mean
ing in the past or of the utter absence of
meaning in its present continuance.
In the good old days of Berkeley it wÂ«
customary to celebrate Charter day by an ad
dress from a representatl\e of each of the
three upper classes. It was assumed that no
freshman could be sufHcier.tly mature to par
ticipate in such a dignified programme, and so
the freshman class was each year officially
snubbed The unwisdom of this plan was
shown by the Tact that the young m.-n re
sented their omission and determined that If
they could no., be represented in a dignified
way they would force themselves upon the at
tention of the university authorities and the
public generally by some means of offensive
publicity. To thlf end various devices were
tried by enterprising freshmen leaders, but
none proved so successful as the class number
formed in lime upon the eteep hillside. TniÃ
was a challenge for a combat, which no so
phomore with the proper spirit of class loyalty
could ignore, and a rough-and-tumble fight in
the hills could be safely depended upon as
a result.
When the plan of h*ving sophomore, junior
and senior addresses at the Charter day ex
ercises was very wisely abandoned by the
university authorities, and instead some dis
tinguished speaker was invited to make an
important address on that occasion the excuse
for this display of class partisanship no longer
existed but the "tradition" had been estab
lished and must not be allowed to die out. So
It was that year after year the fre#hnv n held
the fort and sophomores went forth to battle
In defiance of prohibitions and threa:s from
the students' affairs committee.
NOT ORNAMENTAL.
But if the meaning was lost in putting the
freshman class number upon the hills when
the system of student speaker* at Charter day
was abandoned how doubly meaningless la the
prcaent plan of freshmen and sophomores com
bining to put up a great "C" on the spot?
It is not. an exhibition of spirit nor of univer
sity spiii*; it is neither useful noi ornamental.
On th*Â» contrary. If it is done the "C '
will be a permanent blot on the landscape,
a permanent witness to the bad taste of stu
dents, a public exhibition of misdirected
energy.
Now. If the students of the two low&r classes
wish to perpetuate the tradition of a freshman
Charter day representation, why not make the
occasion significant and a proof of their de
votion to the university? The senior class has
established an admirable tradition of lcav ns
some class day token that will permanently
enrich the grounds. Why should not the two
lower classes, or the freshman cla*s alone,
elevate the Charter day tradition into some
thing of this sort 0 There are numberless tem
porary wooden bridges across the creeks in the
univrrMty grounds'. Suppose the cement, in
stead of being used for a meaningless ' C" on
the hilltop should be worked into a small
(.client bridce In the hollow. Or It niicht be
put Into the form of a drinking fountain, or a
bench, with a tablet inserted giving the cla-Â«s
which did the work and the occasion.
Frank Todd. a prominent university
alumnus, graduate of "94. has written
to the college publications the fallow
ing paragraphs on the subject:
The big "C may reasonable be expected to
He cut '.pon the soft bosom of the hill* aÂ»
iong M the hill* have one: how long, nobody
knows. It may survive our civilization. It
may challenge the attention and excite the
n-nndcrs of voyager* through the Golden Gate
when the alphabet of which it is a part has
perished from thÂ« memory of men. For we are
the ancients of a later, day; and unhappily,
moet of our workj are. in the view of time
and history, hardly more permanent than the
bloom on a Dlum.
My only fear in regard to it is that the
thing may not be done well enough. Koxty
tons of cement Is good. A hundred would
be better. I hop^the under classmen wtU en
gage the co-operaTlon of the best engineers in
the undergraduate body, select the most prom
ising site, and base the big "C" on founda
tions that reach to the core of the world.
Recorder James Sutton of the uni
versity says:
While I should emphatically favor almost
any structure that would be a monument to
the birth of the larger university spirit, I
should regard the concrete "C" as an objec
tionable feature in the landscape, esthetically
considered. I have at present nothing better
to suggest. On the whole. I should prefer the
"C" to claÂ«Â» number*, with their annual ac
companiment of disorder.
SOME OTHER OPINION'S.
Professor Irving Stringham speaks
thus of the big "C" episode:
I sympathise with Professor Whitney in his
hnpe that our beautiful hills may not be dis
figured with unsightly objects, and if the big
â¢â¢C" io to bÂ« so conspicuous as to make it a
dominant feature of the landscape I should
urge that a more suitable site for It be chosen.
I suggest that a place at the base of the hills
not far fr"m thÂ» university buildings could
bÂ« found for it, where an annual ceremonial
of an appropriate and interesting character
could be presented and be partietuated In by
the entire body of students of the two lower
classes. Such an occasion could easily be
made of far greater Interest to the college
community that a class rush, which has al
ready died a natural death In many of our
older Institutions.
The college boys are going steadily
ahead with their plan to construct the
big "C," despite opposition of "lovers
of the beautiful." The work of con
struction will be done next Saturday,
with the co-operation of John Galen
Howard, architect of the university.
The student body's feeling is repre
sented by an editorial in the Daily CaU
fornian to-day, from the pen of Editor
J. P. Loeb, who writes thus:
It ;u: hard to believe that to little, a thine

CONFESSES HIS
UNIQUE FRAUD
University Student Admit*
Having Fonred Name of
Principal to a Document
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
214s Center Street. March 14.
Confession of fraud, exercised while
he sought entrance to the University of
California, was made to-day by H. F.
Freuler, a member of the freshman
class, and he was promptly expelled
from the college, where he haa been a
student. Freuler forged the nam* of
Principal Morris C. James at
Berkeley High School to a cerrtflcat-
which purported to show that F
: had passed a satisfactory examination
: In physics at the High School and was
qualified to enter the University of
California as a freshman.
Freuler is a resident of Berkeley.
! h!s home being on Ridge road. At thÂ«
university he has been prominent in
his class affairs, particularly In
athletics. He was on the varsity base
ball team as a pitcher and was expect
ed to prove a tower of strength to the
! team, because of his skill. It Is un
usual for a freshman to make a vaxsity
team of any sort, and. Freuler's feat
n-as accordingly the more notable. H-Â»
graduated from the Berkeley High
School last term.
The fraud of which he w*Â« fuiltv,
in forging Professor James' name H
an examination paper, was not dla
i covered until a few days ago, when
i the circumstance accidentally became
known to a member of the faculty
Freuler was summoned to explain and
! soon broke down, confessing? his gruiit.
The Academic Council this afternoon
recommended his expulsion, and the
faculty of the College of Mechanic*
took action accordingly, later giving
out the following official announce
ment:
"For confessed fraud committed at
the time of his entrance to the Univer
sity of Cattfornia in August. 1904. H. F
j Freuler of the freshman class ha* been
1 expelled from the University of Cali

during effects of indiscreet indulgence
in "vino" his unseemly conduct last
Sunday afternoon in Golden Gate
Park. '"Vino," he explained to Police
Judge Fritz, is the standard tipple of
the natives of the Philippines, and it
was while serving Uncle Sam in the
islands that he imprudently imbibed
th* tuff to excess, it being cheaper
snd much easier to obtain than his
favorite beverage, which is beer. While
the Filipinos did not seem to be af
fected in an extraordinary way by
drinking "vino." its influence upon the
mentality of the American soldier was
both disturbing and lasting. Although
he has not tasted the liquor since he
left Manila, several months ago, its
dregs apparently lurk in his system,
for niÂ» sooner does he drink a glass of
beer than his mind becomes deranged
and he does things that he subse
quently blushes for.
Park Policeman Mann testified that

Remarkable Curative Properties of a
Remedy for Indigestion and
Stomach Weakness.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, a prepa-
ration for the cure of dyspepsia and
the various forms of indigestion and
â tomach trouble, owes Its great suc-
cess as a cure for these troubles to
the fact that It is prepared for disease
and weakness of the stomach and di-
restlve organs onlj% and la not recom-
mended or advised for any other dis-
ease.
It is not a cure all, but for any stom-
ach trouble it is undoubtedly the saf-
est, most sensible remedy that can be !
advised with the prospect of a per- I
manent cure. It is prepared in tablet
form, pleasant to taste, composed of
vegetable and fruit essences, pure pep-
sin and Golden Seal, every one of which
act effectively in digesting the food
eaten, thereby resting and invigorat-
ing the weak stomach; rest is nature's
cure for any disease, but you cannot
rest the stomach unless you put into it
something that will do its, work or as-
sist in the digestion of food.
That is exactly what Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets do, one grain of the di-
gestive principle contained in them will
digest 3000 grains of meat, eggs or
â¢ similar (Wholesome foods; they will di-
gest the food whether the stomach is
Ja working order or not, thereby nour-
ishing the body and resting the stom-
ach at the same time, and rest and
nourishment Is nature's cure ? for any

S petite these tablets build up the

they digest : flesh-forming food, which

Miss Mamie Jensen, whose slim fig
ure was effectively topped by a widely
spreading mass of spring millinery,
declared that the treatment she re
ceived just prior to her attack on Pa-
Irpiman Dave Murphy was so unjust
: s to justify what she did with a hat
r.iii â i. c.. puncture his neck and head
in several places. Was it not enough
to rout the equanimity of any lady,
she asked, to have persons butt in and
attempt to entice away her masculine
osrort while 3lumming? That was
v.-hat provoked her to disturb the
peace, and U was the policeman's
s=^<-ming approval of the provocation
that led to the hatpin-play and the
additional charge of battery.
"With a gentleman recently arrived
from Tonopah, Miss Jensen explained,
she visited an O'Farrell-Htreet concert
hal at 2:30 o'clock yesterday morn-
Ins and no sooner were they seated
than one of the managers of the place
Invited her companion to Inspect the
green-room, whatever that might be.
Miss Jensen protested against being
Ml alone, whereupon the manager
c-nlled her a "knocker," and insisted
on depriving her of the society of the
man from the mines, until her pru
dence gave way to anger and she dis
turbed the peace. It was while await
ing the arrival of the patrol wagon
summoned by her custodian that she
Jabbed him with the pin taken from
her coiffure, and she supposed she was
driven to frenzy by realization of the
humiliating position In which she
found herself. If the Court ques
tioned her plea that she was a victim
cf gross injustice,, she would call its,
attention to thÂ» fact that a lady who'
happened to be passing by at the time
of the arrest pronounced It an out
rage and was also run In for disturb- ,
nnce of the peace.
The lady alluded to was Miss Helen
Williams, buxom and self-reliant, who
informed the court that she was en
route from a candy store managed by
her to her home when she witnessed
and protected against the rough man
ner in which the policeman was
handling Miss Jensen, who was a to
tal stranger to her, and that the po
liceman made her a prisoner also.
"I must find both defendants guilty
as charged," said Police Judge Mo
gan.
"That." quoth Miss Jensen, with a
withering glance at the bench, "is what
a lady gets for refusing to take the
double-cross from a bum music hall
manager."
"After my arrest," murmured Miss
Williams, shrugging her plump shoul
ders, "I suppose I would be foolish
to be surprised at anything the cops

AGAINST RAIL
G. Ducarpe Says That Indi
vidual Was Beaten Because
He Insulted Miss McHenry
TELLS OF ONE INCIDENT
Contradictory Stories as
to Withdrawal of Prosecu
tion Against Lady in Case
The trial of the damage suit brought
by Garfield Rayl against Roland Mul
dock, Frank Hancock, Sol l^andsburg
and John Daly for an alleged assault
was resumed yesterday in Justice of
the Peace Van Nqstrand's court. The
attorney for the defendants endeav
ored to show that the assault on Rayl
was the result of his continued insults
to Miss Theresa McHenry, who testi
fied at the last hearing that she had
been a party to the plot of the defend
ants and had lured Rayl to the pro
posed scene of attack on Davis street
bj a story concocted for the occasion.
The fact that Rayl had tressed his
unwelcome attentions upon Miss M< -
Henry was strongly brought out by one
witness, George Ducarpe, formerly pro
prietor of the Larchmont House, where
Miss McHenry kept herself hidden
after the attack on Ray! to keep away
Irom newspaper reporters.
"Mica McHenry told me about the
fight after it happened," said Ducarpe.
She ae-emed to be proud Of the part she
bock in the scheme and happy over
the faot that she had lured Kayl to
the vicinity of Sunguinetti's restaurant
by the tale that she had won $25 at
the races and. wanted him to take her
home. Sho said the four men wanted
to b^at Rayl because he had insulted
her. She went into the details of the
insult, but it was needless, as 1 had
witnessed it. The incident occurred in
room 31 of the Edgmere Hotel, and
when I appeared Rayl ceased to annoy
Miss McHenry, who told the defend
ants In the case about her trouble."
Rayl's attorney asked Ducarpe if it
was not a fact that it was agreed to
concoct the story that Rayl had at
tacked Miss McHenry, but it was un
decided whether to fix the incident at
the Edgmere or the Angelus Hotel.
Ducarpe answered that a similar in
cident happened at the Angelus in the
room of Hancock, who also witnessed
the second affair, but he (Ducarpe)
knew personally about the Edgmere
occurrence only.
Sol Landsburg, one of the defend
ants, was a voluble witness, alleging
that Ravi's reputation was not good
and that Rayl owed him money.
"Rayl had often boasted he could
whip Brltt," said Landsburg, "and I
went down just to see the fight on
Davis street, but did not know that
Murdock, Daly and Hancock were go
ing to attack him. Miss McHenry told
me that her brother-in-law, M. Haas,
and Rayl's attorney had agreed with
her that she would not be prosecuted
civilly or criminally if she would tes
tify that she had been intimidated by
Hancock into being a confederate in
the plot to beat Rayl. She said she
did not want to testify to such a lie
and Hancock had advised her to tell
the truth."
Landsburg's* testimony was in direct
conflict with that of Miss McHenry,
who previously testified that she feared
the defendants would do her bodily
harm if she did not Join the conspir
acy. The case was then continued un
til Sr week from Friday.
Left Her Room Door Unlocked.
Mrs. Sorensen, who room* at Van
Ncsa avenue and McAllister street,
when on a visit to her mother on last
Monday inadvertently left her rooms
unlocked. When she returned after
her visit she found that her $300 seal
skin coat had been taken from its ac
customed place in her clothes closet.
Nothing else was taken by the person
who removed the coat. A description
of the garment was furnished to Cap
tain Mooney of the City Hall police

to give Mary Ann Hamilton, chronic

as they believed her reformation Is
still a possibility.
â¢If I let you go," said his Honor to
Mary Ann, "will you do as these la
dies want you to do?"
"Well," was the answer, "I'm tired
of jail and I guess I might as well
take a whirl at salvation."
She was given opportunity to take
the whirl.
Miss Florence Thompson, young
and comely and neatly groomed, re
quested that she be given time to ca
ble to her opulent friends in London
the news of her predicament ere she
be tried on the charge of pilfering a
case of cheap jewelry from the Em
porium. She recently moved in the
upper circles of London society, she
informed Judge Mogan, and if- af
forded opportunity to communicate
with some of her former associates in
the haut ton this little matter of her
arrest would surely be arranged to the
satisfaction of all concerned. His
Honor gave her a week in which to
work the cable.
The policeman who arrested Miss
Thompson averred that in apart
ment at 621 OFarrell street he found
a silver flask which, he believed, had
been stolen by her.
"My dear man,' 'she said, "If you
only knew where and how to search
you might find more things which I
did not steal." With which crushing
remark she returned to durance.
Li Shue, who killed Leong Nooey at
her home, 637 Jackson street, on
February 10, was sent to the Superior
Court by Judge Mogan, who denied to
fix bail. Leong Nooey was a married
vvorrfan, and because she refused tbi
elope with LI Shue he hacked her to
death with a cleaver.

Coins So Poorly Imitated
That So One Could Ever Be
Deceived Into Taking Any
For ten years a slave to the use of
morphine. Walter Horn of 1620 Laguna
street essayed to obtain money for the
purpose of satisfying his craving for
the drug by making counterfeit coins.
He occupied the second story of a small
buOdlÃg in rear of No. 1620, his brother
Joseph, an industrious electrician, oc
cupying rooms in the house in front.
United States Secret Service Agents
Hazen, Moffitt and Foster learned sev
eral weeks ago that he had been buy
ing lead, copiier, antimony, tin and
plaster of parts, and the sleuths shad
owed him. They found that he was
not attempting to pass counterfeit
money, and it was decided that they
should seize his plant and put an end
to his and their midnight vigils, so at a
late hour on Monday night the three
sleuths, armed w-ith electric dark lan
terns of the latest and most approved
'pattern, tiptoed up stairs, holding their
breath meanwhile. Arrived at the
landing fchey found the door unlocked
and they bolted into the room. The
counterfeiter was sitting near the bed,
shaving himself. Hazen took the razor
away from the amateur barber for fear
that he might cut himself,- and placed
Horn under arrest. On a table in the
same room lay a complete counterfeit
ing plant, consisting of a gasoline fur
nace, several crucibles and melting
pots, a pair of gold scales, a large col
lection of plaster molds for quarters,
halves and dollars; a large quantity of
metal and plaster and a small bag
full of counterfeit coins. The coins
are so poorly made, however, that the
secret service men have doubts whether
any person would accept them for
good money. The prisoner admitted
his guilt. He said that because he
had not been able to find any one to
give him instructions In the art of
coining he had not been able to do as
good work as he should.
The prisoner is an ex-convict, having
served a term in ths penitentiary fo.
burglary.
John Rivas, a driver for the Board
of Health, brought to Agent Hazen's
office yesterday four plaster molds for
the manufacture of counterfeit dollars
and one coin, all of which he had
found in an ash can on Stockton street,
between Sutter and Post.

Grand Festival n f Oranges
===== 5 Vrf^f I V â¬11 VI \*l ClJi^Cr Jr
i How many San Franciscans have ever had the opportunity to see orange trees in full bearing? '.,?
Comparatively few, we know. That's the reason we have sent 'way down South and secured 5 a
number of beautiful orange and lemon treesâ some: standing fifteen feet in height.
Orange growing is one of California's greatest and grandest industries and this unique
exhibit, the first ever arranged in this city, will be an object lesson to both young and old.
A veritable orange â¢ grove has been arranged on our fourth floor, with the sweet-scented, ,
luscious fruit hanging from every branch. -. Bring the children to see the magnificent display.
One of the primary reasons for the grand orange festival is to acquaint our customers
with the value and different ; uses of this fruit, as well as to help along the industry. We
: have : secured an immense quantity of the famous Washington Navel Oranges and will offer
them ;at a price which will barely cover the cost. The .same oranges cannot be bought for
Â£ less than 35c dozen. Our price, beginning This Morning and for the remainder of the week,
: will be 20c dozen. ; ';V - ; ; ;;

STATE SHOULD

A meeting of the River Improve

California was held last night. Those
present were Rufus P. Jennings, pres

L. Shinn, John W. Ferris, P. J. Van

The committee appointed by the
San Francisco Chamber of Commerce
to report on the building of a bridge
across Carquinez Straits listened to
the views of the executive committee
of the River Improvement and Drain
age Association. Mr. Jennings stated
that the question at issue was the
building of a bridge that would be
helpful to all interests and that the
association would not be opposed to
the construction of a bridge if it were
not detrimental to navigation or the
carrying* of the waters of the river?
to the sea. He thought that skilled
and unbiased opinion should be ob
tained, and recommended that the
Secretary of War be memorialized in

Resolved, by the River Improvement and

requesting him to Instruct the commission of
engineers appointed In pursuance of the act
of Congress as a part of thÂ«4r duties to ex
amine Into and report as to the best means
by which the Strait* of Carqutnez. In said
State of California, can be crossed by a rail
road bridge, allowing the needful development
of railroad traffic without adversely affecting
the Interests of navigation, reclamation or the
free outflow of the flood waters of the San
Joaquin and Sacramento rivers to the sea;
and to request him that pending such Investi
gation no permission be granted for the con
struction of a bridge across said straits.
Captain W. H. Matson expressed
himself as in favor of a similar report
from the committee appointed by -the
San Francisco Chamber of Commerce
to that chamber.
William R. Wheeler of the Chamber
of Commerce committee stated that
from what he had learned from ship
pers and engineers he was opposed to
the building of a trestle bridge across
Carquinez Straits. He did not favor
the owning of a bridge by individual In
terests, but thought it should be owned
by the State so that transportation
companies of all classes, railroads,
trolley lines, vehicles and foot pas
sengers might come across. Mr. Wheel
er stated that It was particularly evi
denced from Mr. Schwerin's talk that
a trestle bridge was undesirable. The
necessity for a tug to be provided by
the railroad company, buoys, dredges
and other contrivances argued that a
trestle bridge was an obstruction to
navigation. He thought the raatter of
a bridge to be built by the State should
be agitated with the view to action by
the ne*t Legislature.
C. D. Clarke of Stockton said that
no corporation would ever be granted
the privilege of a bridge across the
Hudson River; he did not see why an
exclusive? bridge should be made M
the Carquinex Straits.
Ferris and Van Loben Sels were of
the op;i ion that no trestle bri Ise could
be built without causing a raise in the
river bed
The work of the River Improvement
Association, Â»said Mr. Jennings, has
just begun. The pas-sage of the drain
age district bill is a great step, because
the land owners now have repiescnta
tion.
The opinion of the executive commit
tee is ihst now that individual ques
tiens have beeen settled there will be

THE OAKLAND ELECTION.
WE have already called attention to the example furnished by
the political methods pursued in Oakland. The campaign,
which was then on. ended with the election on Monday.
One suggestion stands nut large in the result. The indorsement of
the Municipal League was a stronger influence than a partisan nom
ination. Through that indorsement it is believed that the city has
secured a fairly strong city government.- well equipped at least for
the legitimate purposes of a municipal administration.
â¢vernment is a political concern, and its administration is a
political trust, distinct in its character from a merely partisan exer
cise of authority. The custom is old which permits parties to select
candidates for the trusteeship of government. When a custom pre
>ng as to seem a prescriptive right, it riiay be subject to
abuse. This causes the necessity for some rationalizing process
which can protect the people and their political government from
partisan abuses. The authority which can put that process in force
must be personally disinterested and of such personnel and character
aÂ« will inspire confidence in it. When it gets in action and is
clothed in popular confidence, it is of necessity the strongest influence
in the reformation and uplift of party operations. This stage has
been reached in Oakland, with the Municipal League as the agent of
the progress that has been made since the old days of mere partisan
control. â 
We must consider government in the light of its capacity to do
thr things that properly belong to it. It is not pretended that a mu
nicipal administration can at once overcome the inertia and neglect
that are written all over the field of its authority. The best of men,
â¢elected by the severest examination, may not all at once weed out
the habits and customs of municipal administration. But each suc
ceeding officiary of a city, held up to its work by the influence of a
rationalizing authority, may make some progress, with the result
that finally a new scries of precedents and of new habits will replace
trie old. and the whole administration will finally rise to a plane from
which its dislodgment will be more difficult than was the displace
ment of the less exalted system which preceded it.
All large cities, and San Francisco among them, need this ra
tionalizing process. It will stand over parties like conscience over
the conduct of men. It makes a double appeal. It calls upon the
pride of parties, and the ambition of individual politicians to succeed.
It stands inflexibly in the way of the success of the unworthy, and
unworthy cea^e to try and leave the field to those who bear
the disinterested scrutiny of the guardians of public rights and official
virtue. On the other hand, such an authority makes a perpetual ap
peal to public spirit ami civic righteousness. It is the still small
voice, crying by day and by night its warning and admonition.
It is entirely within the power of even a small body of public
spirited citizens in thi* city, ambitious only for the good govern
ment and fair fame of San Francisco, to compel the choice of a city
administration that is above reproach. It can gentle and make clean
and proper every part bf the government. It can curb greed, make
ilr. purify the ballot-box, economize expenses, lift bur
dtns from the taxpayers, make every citizen safe in his business and
roper enterprise from illegal oppression and exaction, and can
make this a city set upon a hill, a light shining afar, for the encour
agement of others who are under the hard heel of misdirected par
tisan government, that has no bit in its mouth and no spur in its
flank to make it do better.
For years this city has been' subject to criticism directed at its
â¢lmental methods. Xo one party and no single administration
ipomibir for this odium. It is inherent in a system and habit
that are the rule in American cities. One party ousts the other by
Tig to its faults and promising reform. But when the "outs"
have become the "ins" they set their feet in the beaten path of
practice and habit, and for. every old and well known abuse they
correct there is substituted a new one, of which the people are una
ware because it is new. When these new abuses become cognizable
and arc known the process is repeated. The people have forgotten
the old and smart under the new. They have no recourse but to re
turn to the party that was ousted, and so the weary round is tramped
over again and again. To what can the people turn except to a ra
tionalizing force that can compel administrations not only to pro
gressively correct indirections and abuses in government, but also
without replacing them with others which in time become equally
galling?-
The heroic action of the Merchants' Association in detecting
and following to punishment the corruption of the ballot-box at the
last primary is in line with the system needed to rationalize the city
government. The results have shown that the courts and the people
need only to be furnished the opportunity and they will correct
abuses of that kind. Give the people the guidance necessary and they
will project that correction into all the abuses of government. We
invite the present attention of the people to this subject. If they
wait until the party file closers and truncheon swingers and the push
fiave done their work, it will be too late.
THE ST. LOUIS AWARDS.
THE Utah Commissioner at the St. Louis Exposition was badly
tangled in his accounts, and a committee of the Legislature went
st Louis to investigate him. On its return this committee
heports that honors and medals are on sale. The text of the report
listeadtflg impression. At first glance it would appear
that these sold and fraudulent insignia are the official awards made
by the various juries that sat on exhihits. This is not so. Un
scrupulous parties, aware of the commercial value and the advertis
er importance of the exposition awards, are engaged in the manu
facture and sale of fraudulent insignia, to equally unscrupulous busi
men. who use them for advertising purposes.
These fraudulent and criminal practices have nothing to do
with the official awards. They are counterfeit and false. Of course
their issue and use dilute the value of the bona fide awards, but we
are not aware that any but a moral law is violated by the per
nicious practice. If this be so. and the perpetrators and beneficiaries
of these fraud> cannot be legally punished, the suggestion is obvious.
In future expositions, here or elsewhere, there should be legal pro
tection of the official awards against frauds and counterfeits. Honest
exhibitors who, at great cost, display their wares and get awards
and honors are entitled to such protection. So, too. the officers and
official juries are entitled to the protection of their honor from such
;<;n as is thrown upon it by such proceedings.
is sort of fraud is to follow every great exposition, those
events will cease to be. Instead of illustrating the world's industrial
and civic progress, they will serve the purpose only of grafters, coun
terfeiters and frauds.

Knight of the Middle Ages
TROY ALLISON
"Eight o'clock/' he said in sur
prise.
, s f~^v ONT you think we are going
I l rather fast?" Her eyes
i 3 were opened to their utmost
*-^ limit and she kept a furtive
grip on the seat.
Crawford guided the automobile
over the last cobblestone street that
led to the country road.
"Just poking," he said, staccato.
"But this is my first trip in one â
my country blood is feeling con
gealed," she gasped as the machine
leaped from the last layers of cobble
stones and went whizzing along the
dirt road.
He put on more speed and they
rushed on madly, Crawford gazing in
tently before him.
She remembered stories of people
who had suddenly been struck with
insanity, and little cold chills crept
up and down her spine.
"Aren't we running away?" she
quavered.
"That's exactly what we're doing."
he said calmly; "in fact, we're elop
ing."
"Of all things:" Her exclamation
now expressed the settled conviction
that he was a victim of insanity.
"It's this way, Elizabeth." he ex
plained with the calmness, she
thought, that precedes an insane out
burst, "you have refused me twelve
times, and I have my own supersti
tions about trying the thirteenth."
She looked at him somewhat hope
fully â at least his memory was not
entirely gone.
"I heard you last week at the Rich
ley dinner party," he continued,
"saying that you liked the strength of
purpose of the men of the middle
ages, that men of to-day were apa
thetic creatures without a proper sup
ply of backbone. You went so far
as to say you would prefer being kid
naped by a man of that type to be
ing" begged and teased and implored
by the men of to-day. Now, my
child" â he turned toward her, smil
ing broadly â "you will have the good
ness to behold your fairy godmother,"
patting his chest that she might locate
the said godmother. "I am giving
you jour wish â you are being abduct
ed in the style of the middle ages."
"You're a brute!" she said conclu
sively.
"Oh. not quite so bad as that," ex
tenuatingly. "Of courses I could not
furnish the absolutely proper stage
settings. You will observe that I had
to omit the white palfrey. I didn't
pian this in time to advertise for a
white palfrey, and I thought I might
not be able to handle you as tenderly,
charging along upon me. I'll admit
that the up-to-dateness of this ma
chine introduces a false chronological
note" â sorrowfully â "but v.on't you
admit that you are more comforta
ble?"
"I hate you," she responded icily.
"That's no obstacle to a determined
knight of the middle ages." He w<^
exceedingly cheerful. "In fact diffi
culty lends charm to an adventure."
NO WONDER!
Heâ And what character do you represent?
Dollyâ Oh, I'm Queen of the Moon.
Heâ By Jove, no wonder there's a man In It I
âAlly Sloper-
"You'll take me home this very min
| ute," she commanded imperiously.
"Not so were the Sabine women
j obeyed." He was tragically firm.
"I'll got out and walk."
"You might if I slowed up the ma-
I ohine." ' He ,jut on more speed delib
! erately. "But jumping out just at
[this stage of the game would be a
somewhat dangerous feat."
She dropped into her seat resent
! fully. "I have heard of a proverb,
Mr. John Crawford" â the sarcasm in
her voice was intense â "that has prob
ably never been entertained by your
benighted mind. Possibly you have
heerd that there is a difficulty in get
ting: a horse to drink, even after you
have led him to water."
"My dear girl, your positive and
strenuous knight of the middle ages
would have staked that horse right
there until he got so thirsty he would
have neighed fnr water."
She sat in silence for the next half
hour.
"I'm almost frozen," she said petu
lantly. .'Perhaps it's part of your
flan that I get my fingers and nose
frostbitten."
"It's too bad," politely, "but when
ever you are ready to marry me we
rill head this machine for the near
est minister."
"Then we will wear this automobile
to a frazzle. I hope you have a per
petual motion motive power and don't
depend entirely upon gasoline."
Crawford gave her a startled glance
fre-m the corner of his eye, surprised
that she knew the machine weuld not
keep on indefinitely.
"Oh, that's all right," cheerfully.
She relapsed into her sulky silence,
and for the next hour Crawford went
steadily ahead, whistling occasionally
to relieve the monotony.
He turned the machine into a lone
ly road branching off from the main
road. They passed over a swampy
spot that the automobile almost re
fused to take. He drove farther into
the neglected wildness and the auto
mobile suddenly stopped with a snort.
"Suffering saints!" he exclaimed
disgustedly, hastily jumping out; "fif
teen miles from anywhere or anybody
and the power giv&n out."
She didn't say a word, but reached
down and appropriated all the robes,
wrapping them around her snugly.
He took out a cigar, lit it and tramp
ed up and down meditatively.
"No use trying to fix it, " he in
formed her dolefully; "it's a. hopeless
case."
The short winter afternoon was
drawing to a close and the gray of
early twilight settled dismally over
the gloomy pines.
"I'm hungry, too," she said with
the suspicion of a sob.
"If you would only consent to be
Mrs. John Crawford to-night, we
would try to find a house somewhere
where we could have a jolly supper
and a lire."
"You'd make a nice lovable hus
band, wouuldn't you?" she said in in
dignant scorn. "What woman would
want to marry a brute capable of
starving and freezing her to death?"
"My child, those are cultivated
characteristics, cultivated merely to
win your admiration and undying re
gaid. My real disposition is so gen
tle as to make a lamb seem stern and
unrelenting. But I couldn't afford to
follow the dictates of my tender
heart â you would say 1 was lacking
in will power. I am ruling you with
an iron rod. O Ladye fair, and you
sit right there until you promise to
marry me."
An hour later he wondered if she
were asleep, the bundle of rugs had
remained r silent heap while he
tramped the road.
He took out his watch and struck
a. match.
"Eight o'clock," he said in surprise.
"It's really not proper for you to stay
here all night. I don't think Craw
ford is a particularly undesirable
name to bear."
"I'll â I'll m-marry you," came in
quavering tones from the bundle of
rugs.
"At the very first opportunity?" he
asked eagerly.
"Yes â better get a disagreeable thing
over with as soon as possible." deject
edly.
He jumped quickly into the auto
mobile.
"Don't touch me," she said. "I hate
you, hate you, hate you, and I'm go
ing to make you as miserable as I
possibly can."
He laughed happily. "I'll look out
for my personal safety-"
He put his hand on the lever and
the machine shot forward energetic
ally. He drove forward a quarter of
a mile, and turning suddenly, came In
sight of a house, brilliantly lighted.

AMONG the noted business wo

Elizabeth Hewitt. In compiling
her family history, which takes
in several prominent business
men in Camden and former Governor
Vansant of Minnesota, Mrs. Hewitt
recently found that the figure "9" has
played a prominent part in her life,

ONE-SIDED MEN.
Faculties must be exercised or they
will not grow. Nature is too good an
economist to allow us to keep any
faculty or function which we do not
employ. We can have just what we
ust , and that will constantly increase;
everything else will be gradually taken
away from us. Man becomes strong
and powerful and broad just in propor
tion to the extent and healthfulness of
the activity of his faculties; and it
must not â¢ ohe-sided, not an exercise
of one or two faculties, or one set of
faculties, or the man will topple over.
Balance in life comes from the' health
ful exercise of all the faculties. One
reason why we have so many one-sided
men in this country, says O. S. Marden
in "Success Magazine." is because they
pursue one idea, exercise one side of
their nature, and. of course, they can
not retain their balance. This is one
of the curses of specialties^ They are
a good thing for the race/ but death
to the individual who pursues his

PAPER BLANKETS.
Paper, as is well known, is one of the
best non-conductors of heat, and were
It not for its perishable character it
would doubtless be more frequently
employed as a heat insulator. The
proposal therefore to manufacture
paper blankets is really a rational
proposition. Used In conjunction with
the usual sheets and a woolen blanket
or two, paper blankets would make an
agreeable substitute for the counter
pane or cotton-lined comfortable. Their
light weight is also a very desirable
feature.

GOVERNMENT WHITEWASHâ .
N. J. N., Del Paso, California. The
method of making whitewash as uaei
by the Treasury Department of th*
United States is as follows: Slack
half a bushel of unslacked lime with
boiling water, keeping it covered
during the procese. Strain it. and
add a peck of salt, dissolved in warm
water; 3 pounds of ground rice, put
in boiling water and boil to a thin
paste; half pound powdered Spanish
whiting and a pound of clear glu-*
solved in warm water. Mix these
well together and let the mixture
stand for several days. Keep the
wash thus prepared in a kettle or por
table furnace, and when used, put it
on as hot as possible, with a painter's
or whitewash brush. This has been
found, by experience, to answer on
wood, brick and stone nearly as well
as oil oaint and it is much cheaper.
JAYHAWKERâ W. R, Fairbanks,
Mendocino County, Cal. Jayhawker is
a word which was appfled in 1866 to
bushrangers and guerrillas during the
Kansas trouble. It was perpetuated
during the Civil War and wai subse
quently applied to political maraud s
and pillagers. The term is doubtle-9
derived from jayhawk, a ferocious bird
that delights 1- killing for the love
thereof. The word came originally
from Australia, where It was coined
to mean a. thief by nature, who could
also, according to the occasion, be a
pillager and a murderer. James 'air
land, in his dictionary of slang, says:
"Jayhawker is an irregular (very ir
regular) cavalryman who performed
for the Southern Confederacy service
very similar to that rendered by the
'Bummers' to the Union forces during
the Civil War. The Jayhawker was a
guerrilla by nature, a thief by practice
and often a murderer and a pillager."
Bartlett, in his work on Americanisms,
says that Jayhawker is a cant term in
the Western States for a lawless '>r
other soldier not enlisted, a freeboot
ing armed man. a guerrilla, and adda
the following from the New York
World of IMS: "Tile Leavenworth Con
servative says the term was first ap
plied to Colonel Jennison of New York,
and being a jovial, festive and livÂ»;v
cuss, his comrades always spoke of him,
as a "gay New Yorker.' This expres
sion was afterward used to designate
his men and in Its various travels
underwent many changes until at last
it crystallized Into Jayhawker." Gen
eral Sheridan once wrote to the people
of New Orleans: " 'Jayhawker* could
not be applied to the White Leaguer*,
a secret armed body organized In
Louisiana, for the White Leaguers were
not plunderers and robbers."

CHIPMAN MAKES
ANNUAL REPORT
Board of Trade Listens to
Pleasing Story of the
Progress of California
General N. P. Chipman of the Califor
nia State Bnard of Trade yesterday sub- [
mitted an annual report of more than
common interest. Therein he covered
in detail at a length of many news
paper columns the conditions attending
California in a material way, the whole
making an exhaustive and convincing
rÂ«view.
Prior to making his review General
Chipman called attention to the fact
that the State Board of Trade, or
ganized in 1877, has lived to witness in
large measure the fulfillment of its
hopes and desires in the direction of
State growth, in which the California
State Board of Trade has been large
ly instrumental. He also alluded to
the fact that the board hap maintained
a permanent exhibit for fifteen years
and that 1,000.000 i>ersons at least have
viewed the exhibit, as many as 10,000
attending on special days.
The growth of the industries of the
Ftatp was also indicated by a general
statement, which was in part as fol
lows :
In 1*77 our State made but little impression
upon the fruit â  market outside of the State.
In 1800 the shipments had reached 16.000 car
loads of ten tons each. In 1904 the shipment
of products of the orchards, vineyards and
rardene to points beyond the State reached
nearly lOO.'iOO carloads.
There Is every evidence that the year 1906
will witness the largest influx of people to
the State ever known In history, and the time
is opportune for their coming. The State it>
in a highly prosperous condition and every
indication v at this moment forecasts a period
of great productiveness In all ' directions of
Etate development.
. ral Chipman reviewed the dis
tributi'ii "f fruit production in Cali
fornia and said in part:
The distribution, of acreage remains practl- I
rally unchanged. Of the 7308 carloads of ten <
tens each of green deciduous fruit, 84 car- |
loads were from th* southern part of ' the .
State. Of the 15,87Â« carloads of dried fruit, |
847 went from the south. Of 38,674 carload? of :
cltrue fruit, 3(5.358 were from the southern '
portion of the State and 2216 from the north-:
crn tnd central portions. Of the Ml carloads
of nut* 158 went from the north. Of 10.148
carloads of wine and brandy 9667 were from
the north. Of 4787 carloads of vegetables 2381 1
were from the north. ' â ' â 
Substantially all green, dried and canned
deciduous truit and wine and . brandy goes j
from the northern and central regions. . and
also raisins, while only about 6 per cent of ;
the citrus fruits are shipped from this region, j
The most of the walnuts are produced in the
south. Of nuts the north produces almonds
principally. The shipments of vegetables are
about equal fjom the two regions, i
Arthur R. Briggs, manager and sec
retary of the board, reported the work
of the past year. The receipts were
increased to $14,673 73. as compared
with $10,2^4' 93 the preceding year. One
hundred thousand visitors saw the per- |
manent exhibit of the board in the '
ferry building in 1904. The board con
ducted excursions to Modesto, two to
St. Louis and one to the Big Basin.
Among the measures that were sup
ported were receding the Yosemite Val
ley and Mariposa Big Tree grove
to the Federal Government; the im
provement in cereal culture in Cali
fornia; the project of a Pacific Ocean
Exposition on the completion of the
Panama canal; the bond issue to im- ;
prove the water front of San Fran- '
Cisco: the Improvement of Oakland
harbor; making a California exhibit at
the LewUs and Clark Exposition; the
reclamation of swamp and overflowed
lands along the Sacramento and San
Joaquin rivers. The board was repre
sented in the Trans-Mississippi Con
gress at St. Louis. The National Re
tail Grocers' Association was enter- j
tamed.
On motion of John P. Irish it was
voted to make excursions to the Lu
ther Burbank^xperimental farms: aIBO
to the national plant gardens at Chico
and to Stanford University and the
Mt. Hamilton Observatory. George A.
rtennisnn was granted leave of absence
to serve as secretary of the California
commission to Portland until the close
of the Portland Exposition. It was
voted to have pictures made of Cali
fornia valleys to be displayed at Port
land. The old boards of directors anti
officers were re-elected.

LETOLA WINS A CLEVER RACE
Hainault Is Beaten
by Andrew Mack
in a Gallop
Revolt, With Jones
Up, Disposes of
Albemarle.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
If Walter Jennings' mare Letola
I could not win the seven furlong handi
cap # at Oakland yesterday with only
one hundred pounds of baggage to
handle, it seemed there was no re
demption for her. Well, she did. Fol
lowers of the Jennings colors were
forced to accept a scant quotation, 7 to
10 being about the best exposed.
"Big Bill " Knapp sat on the favor
ite's back and he had her under re
straint to the stretch, Jones astride
Princess Tltania mapping out the
route. When given her head Letola
gradually forged to the front, scoring
cleverly by two lengths. Never partial
to heavy going, Princess Titania tired
approaching the wire, and lost the
' place to Gateway. Bombardier re
ceived backing, but found the clip too
breezy.
The books could not have laid away
anything, for four heavily played
choices arrived at the wire on schedule
time. Threatening weather kept the
attendance down somewhat.
KBEL THATCHER WINS HANDILY.
Travers landed the two-year-old dash
lat five furlongs with Ebel Thatcher, a
7 to 5 choice in the ring. Iron Watson
nas accorded considerable support, but
floundered about in the heavy going.
The favorite won handily by a length.
Carrick ran an ordinary third.
Revolt, from the stable of Vie Gil
bert, drew the fire of every sharp
shooter on the range when speculating
en the Futurity course run next de
cided began. The mare's odds were
played down from 6 to 1 to IS to 5
\ . favoritism. Ridden by Jakie Jones, she
went out and won ell the way. It
could be called a lucky win, for Albe
marle. which was beaten only half a
length, would have finished first with
a. better send off. Sol Liechtenstein
loc-k the show. Olympian gave it up,
after being the contender for most of
the route.
To W. Davis solely belongs the
â  redit of placing Bob Ragon over the
S plate winner of the three-quarter mile
run tor 3-year-olds. The colt was sore,
as he usually is, but Davis simply
would not let him lag: behind. Over
taking Gallant GssMle at the paddock,
he outrode McÃride, earning a head de
cision. The winner opened, an 8 to 5
choice, but when a wise play cut th"
price about Gallant Cassie from 2 to i
17 to 10. Ragon's odds lengthened to 13
to 5. The show went to Baker.
' ' DAVIS LANDS ANDREW MACK.
There was nothing to the mile selling
. number but Andrew Mack, the . favor
ite. Billy Cabin's horse met with some
Interference at the first turn, though
. it cut little figure in the ultimate re
sult. Under Davis' tutelage he col
lared Hainault, the pacemaker, at the
head of the stretch, winning in hollow
fashion at the wire. Red Cross Nurse
ran third, more than a length behind
Hainault.
â¢'.' .With riders reversed old Modicum
could have beaten Dusty Miller for the
mile and a furlong selling affair. The
former had first call in the betting and
displayed a spark of his former speed.
But Lloyd Fountain took matters too
leisurely out in front with the veteran
* and when Knapp came at him with a
rush in the stretch on Dusty Miller
Fountain found himself outfinished and
beaten nearly a length. The winner
was played for a good thing, his price
falling from 6 and 7 to 4 to 1. . Mr.
Dingle, ridden by Perrine, collected
show money.
TRACK XOTES.
â  m Revolt, winner of the second race,
"was bid up from 5500 to $SOO by Ab.
Stemler. Vie Gilbert retained the
mare.
The stewards suspended Johnny
Sullivan, the steeplechase rider, for 60
days yesterday. He was charged with
. ; enticing his brother apprentice Frank
Sullivan from his employers, Blanchi
&. McGovern, and encouraging him
to go to Los Angeles.
W. Davis and 'Big Bill" Knapp di
' vided the saddle honors, each piloting
two winners.
The attention of owners is called to

Sues Battling Nelson.
A writ of attachment was served
yesterday on funds In the Western

Nelson. The attachment was sued
out by F. M. Ludwig, one of Nelson's
trainer*, who has brought suit against
the pugilist for $37, alleged to be

Chicago Defeats Tacoma.
FRESNO, March 14.â In a listless
gamÂ», devoid of features, the Chicago
National Club defeated Tacoma here
to-day by a 0 to 2 score. Mike Fisher
had three pitchers in the box, two of
them youngsters who are being tried
out. One was Hastings, who pitched a
few games for Portland at the begin
ning of the season last year, and the
other Brown, who was on Mike's
Sacramento staff for a short time a
few years ago. Neither man was ef
fective. The two allowed fifteen hits.
Thomas* went in for three innings, but
did poor work. The rest of Mike's
men stood up well. Sheehan batted in
good form and did some star fielding.
Pfoffer, Chicago's twirler, pitched a
good game. The game lasted more
than two hours.

ATHLETES SHOW
MARKED SKILL
Perform in Various Sports
and Pastimes for Bene
fit of Women's Club
The popularity of the San Francisco
Women's Athletic Association was
shown last night by the attendance at
the benefit given at the Mechanics'
Pavilion. More than 2000 people gath
ered in the spacious building to witness
the long and varied programme of
athletics and drills given by the dif
ferent clubs and athletic organizations
of this city. The following contributed
to the programme: Olympic " Club,
Young Men's Hebrew Association,
Polytechnic School, Columbia Park
Boys' Club, Eintracht Turn Verein,
members of San Francisco Women's
Association, Occid"-^al Club and Re
liance Club of Oakland. Music was
furnished by Professor Graeber's Man
dolin, Banjo and Guitar Orchestra and
by the Columbia Park Boys' Club band.
The basket-ball game between the
Young Men's Hebrew Association ieam
and Polytechnic team opened the pro
gramme. It was won by the latter by
a score of 8 to 1. Sidney S. Peixotto
was next on the floor with the Colum
bia Park Boys' Club and the young sol
diers went through some clever drills.
The Olympic Club sent a delegation of
versatile athletes, who furnished
wrestling, boxing and other gymnastic
acts to the delight of the spectators.
The Oakland boy.s from the Reliance
Club did much for the success of the
affair. The basket-ball game between
the Olympic Club and the Occidental
Club was called off before the end on
account of lack of time. The Occi
dental Club was in the lead. The

TURF MAGNATES
IN CONFERENCE
Corrisran Says He Wants to
Elevate Baring in the
West to a High Plane
STARTERS ARE ENGAGED
Dick Dwyer and Jake Holt
man Will Preside at the
Barrier for Association
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO. March 14.â Members of
the new American Turf Association
met here to-day. They assigned dates
to various tracks of the association,
adopted a code of rules, issued licenses
to trainers and jockeys, refused appli
cations for licenses to others,
appointed an official timer to
act at the various tracks of the asso
ciation and discussed in general the
ways and means to elevate racing in
the West to as high a plane as possi
ble. The request of the Butter broth
ers, owners of Empire City Track of
New York, to be taken under the wing
of the new organization was refused.
They were Informed that, geograph
ically, it was out of the question for
the new association to embrace the
Empire track and that besides it was
net the policy of the American Turf
Association to mix up in any way with
the racing affairs of the East. It was
pointed out to the Easterners it would
do them no good if their track was in
the new Western circuit, as tracks in
New York are licensed by the State
Racing Board, of which August Bel
mont is chairman.
The Butlers stated they had talked
with Belmont and that he assured
them their track would be licensed if
granted dates by the new Western as
sociation. Corrigan, however, assured
them his associates would not consid
er the plan and the Butlers gave up
hope and went home.
It was announced that Jake Holtman
and Dick Dwyer, the greatest starters
in the West, would officiate at the
tracks of the American Turf Associa
tion. The fact that Dwyer and Holt
man have contracted to Join the new
association is a hard blow to the West
ern Jockey Club, which, consistent with
its recent ruling, will brand them out
laws.
Tod Sloan was granted a license, as
were eighteen other Jockeys and fifty
four trainers who had made applica
tion.
Although standard rules were fol
lowed closely. several important
changes were made. Chief among these
was one calling for six thoroughbred
crosses In the breeding of a horse be
fore it is eligible for registration.
STORM LEAVES
PATH OF RUIN
Damage Done by Wind and
Rain in South Is Estimated
at 3lore Than $500,000
LOS ANGELES, March 14.â T0-day
dawned clear and cool in Los Angeles
and it is apparent that the great storm
that raged almost incessantly along
the southern coast during the last
forty-eight hours is over. It has been
the most disastrous storm experienced
in this region in a decade. As far as
has been learned but one life has been
lost as a result of the storm, that of
a laborer, who was drowned in the
flood waters along the Santa Fe Rail
road near Cajon Pass.
The total damage, scattered over a
wide 1 stretch of territory, is conserva
tively estimated at an amount in ex
cess of half a million dollars. This
includes the damage to streets, build
ings, bridges and other property in this
city, the loss to the steam and electric
railroads and the damage to wharves,
piers and shipping all along the coast.
The damage from the flood waters
to the city's streets alone is estimated
by the Superintendent of Streets to be
more than $50,000.
Both the Southern Pacific and Santa
Fe railroads were victims of extensive
washouts that tied up all traffic in both
directions for more than thirty-six
hours. The Southern Pacific coast line
to San Franci^o was washed out in
three or four places in long stretches
and at least one large trestle carried
out. The worst damage suffered was
at Cajon Pass, where a landslide oc
curred that buried the roadbed beneath
tons of earth from the mountainside.
At the various seacoast towns the
damage from wind and waves will foot
up in the neighborhood of $300.000 i San
ta Monica appears to have been the
worst sufferer. Here the loss is esti
mated at $200,000. Wreckage is strewn
along the coast for a mile and a half.
At Long Beach several boats were
pulled from their moorings, driven
ashore and completely wrecked. The
new pier, built of steel and concrete,
was also damaged. The loss at this
port is estimated at $20,000. At San
Pedro the Government breakwater, in
course of construction, was damaged
to the extent of $12,000. The wireless
telegraph station at this point was
blown down and damaged to the ex
tent of several hundred%ollars.
The towns in the Interior suffered but
little, according to reports that have
been received. In this city lightning
struck the steeple of the Boyle Heights
Methodist Church, which was damaged
to the extent of $3000.

BAKERSFIELD, March 14.â At 2:30
p. m. the main line as far as Mojave
was reported clear and the first east

Several other delayed Santa Fe over

SANTA BARBARA. March 14.â ThÂ«
railroad communications south of th.s
city are still cut off by the washouts
between this cfty and Ventura, and at
Oxnard and Burbank. No trains have
gone south since Sunday morning.
One thousand tourists that have ar
rived in the city from the North ara
delayed here and are impatiently
waiting for the first train south. ThÂ«
railroad is doing everything possible
to bridge the breaks, but is working
under difficulties as all the streams
are flowing bank full, and the hillsides
are so wet that it is difficult to maks
the repairs permanent.
One of the washouts was repaired
yesterday, but a landslide in the night
carried away the crack again and work
was further delayed. This morning J.
H. Wallace, chief engineer of the main

with the hope of clearing up the road

SHIFTS BLAME
TO THE BOARD
Refuses to Be Held Respon
sible in Case a Theater
Catastrophe Should Occur
HOLDS A CONFERENCE
Special Committee and Pub
lic Works Commissioners
Confer About Changes
The Grand Jury yesterday practi
cally shifted responsibility for any
theater accident that may occur, from
its shoulders to those of the Board of
Public Works. Commissioners Mae
stretti, Egan and Aigeltinger appeared
before the Committee of the Grand
Jury, Andrews, Bowes and Davis, and
in a short conference were told of the
various defects that exist in the pres
ent theater buildings and were point
eoiiy informed that Is was "up to
them" to correct existing evils.
The committee had a list of the
theaters of the city, some twenty
eight, and a long statement from Ar
chitect Shea pointed out the defects in
construction of each. According to
the architect's statement there is not
one theater ?n the city in which
changes are not necessary.
The Commissioners were furnished
with the lists and were told that the
Grand Jury* considered their duty at
an end, in so far as the correction of
the evils Is concerned. The Commis
sioners were urged to see the import
ance of acting at once on the sugges
tions of the architect and were told
tnat should a great catastrophe occur
the jury could not consider itself re
sponsible.
Grand Juryman Davis suggested
that the Board of Works should com
municate with the managers of the
various theaters and hold conferences
with them regarding the proper
changes. The idea seemed to meet with,
thi Commissioners' approval and no
doubt such conferences will be held
within the next few days.
In case the board fails to take the
advice and hint of the Grand Jury,
Foreman Andrews said that all that
could be done was to appeal to the
Mayor. This, continued Mr. Andrews,
will not be necessary as the Commis
sioners appeared to acquiesce in the
plans and will no doubt do their duty.
Foreman Andrews In his interview
with the members of the Board of
Works presented a letter he had sent
to Judge Hebbard asking for an Inter
pretation of the injunction issued by
the Judge in regard to 620 Jackson
street. In this letter it was asked
whether the intention was to bar such
a body as the Board of Public Works
from inspecting buildings of that char
acter. ,
Andrews explained to the board that
the Judge had sent a communication in
reply, stating that it was not the pur
poses of the injunction to interfere
with an official in the performance of
his duty.
The board asked for a copy of Judge
Hebbard's letter and informed the
Grand Jury that it would take the mat
ter under oonsideration.
RIGNEY DEMANDS THA^ ,
BOYCOTTERS BE RESTRAINED
Sues for Injunction Against Building
Trades Council and Its
Officers.
Thomas F. Rigney, dealer in tiles
and mantels at 641 Mission street,
has sued the Building Trades Council
of San Francisco and its officers. P.
H. McCarthy, O. A. Tveitmoe and J.
J. Swanson. to restrain them from
carrying on the boycott they have de
clared against the plaintiff.
Rigney alleges that in January,
1904. he was fined $250 by the coun
cil for alleged violations of its rules
and that on January 30 last he was
declared "unfair" by the council and
its agerdts. He further alleges that
the defendants have maintained pick
ets at his establishment for the pur
pose of injuring his business and that
walking delegates have gone to the
owners of buildings in course of con
struction and informed them that if
they purchased material from the
plaintiff they would call a strike of
the men working on such buildings.
Rigney asks that the defendants not
only be restrained from interfering
with his business, but that they be en
joined from claiming that he is '"un
fair."

Editor's Motive in New
York Gas Rate Agitation
CASE OF GETTING EVEN
Says Disappointed Aspirant
for Presiffential Nomina
tion Is Seeking Revenge
ALBANY, N. V., March 14.â The agi
tation in New York City for a lower
gas rate in the city, together with al
legations against the gas companies of
extortionate rates and of maintaining
false meters, resulted to-day in the
adoption by the Senate of a joint reso
lution providing for a joint investiga
tion of the New York gas and electric
lighting situation. The resolution was
not passed, however, until a long and
rather acrimonious debate in which
Senator Grady of New York City, the
Democratic leader and principal repre
sentative of Tammany Hall in the
upper branch of the General Assem
bly, took a conspicuous part. Senator
Grady led the opposition to the resolu
tion, charging that its motive was
purely partisan and directing a par
ticularly bitter attack against William
R. Hearst, who, he said, had joined
hands with Republican State Chair
man Odell to accomplish his purposes.
Said Grady:
I will tell you what the origin of this gas
agitation was. Mr. Hearst was a candidate
for the Presidential nomination. Disappointed
because he did not have the support of Tam
many Hall In that ambition he has since,
through his newspapers, been heaping foul
abuse on the Mayor and on Tammany Hall.
That was the beginning of this gas agitation.
Hearst is the real author of this resolution.
The "whole thing is a miserable political deal.
A bargain was made by the Republicans and
Mr. Hearst by which it was agreed that if this
resolution should pass Hearst would put a
third ticket in the field, in the municipal cam
paign in New York this. fall. This whole thing
is a miserable deal, with nothing but a parti
san object.

SEAMEN ADJUST
THEIR TROUBLES
â¦
Misunderstanding Between
Owners and the Sailors' 1
Tiiion Will Be Settled
â¢
NO STKIKE EXPECTED !
"â â¦â â â - ,'â  â ;
Carmen ; Declare Positively !
That Farley's Arrival ;
Does Not Disturb Them !
â *â - 'â¢; ' â¢ .. â â ' ;â â  *.:.-. !
Though there has been some friction
between the Sailors' Union and the
Steam Schooners' Association of late
over the shipment of sailors, it is not
expected that any serious trouble will
result.
At present the Steam Schooners' As
sociation must get men through the
Sailors' Union. Formerly it shipped its
men through water front boarding
house keepers. Of late there have been
several attempts on the part of the
owners of steam schooners to get men
through the boarding-house people.
This naturally roused the antagonism
of the union.
The Sailors' Union is firm on the
point and it is thought that the Steam
Schooners' Association will yield to it.
The men themselves do not want the
old boarding-house system brought
back.
The Carmen's Union and the man
agers of the United Railroads have no
uneasiness over the announcement of
the early arrival of Mr. Farley in San
Francisco, who is reported to be a
strike breaker. The present conditions
existing between the employes of the
United Railroads and the management
are settled on and under the most
friendly terms for the next two years.
Consequently the arrival of any man
boasting of power to disrupt these ex
isting conditions goes as drivel. Both
managers and employes are perfectly
well satisfied with the conditions now â¢
existing.
The Lumber Clerks' Union held a
high jinks and smoker at the Building
Trades Council Hall last night to cel
ebrate the second anniversary of the
organization. Short addresses were
made by several members of the union,
also by President P. H. McCarthy and
O. A. Tveitmoe of the Building Trades
Council. The management of the even-
Ing's entertainment was intrusted to j
R. Lang, D. Simpson, R. GalvJn, E. j
Cramer and E. Pallas.
Great satisfaction was expressed by !
the members of the Gas Workers' j
Union at the meeting last night when
the announcement was made that
there was a renewal of the old agree
ment between the directors and their
employes for one more year. There was
a nervous strain on the men, as also
on the board of directors, while the
submitted agreement stood in abey
ance. Now that this is settled the
strain is over and the utmost good will
exists along the line of industrial
peace and harmony for one more year.
GROCERS ADOPT RESOLUTIONS.
Association Brands the Communica
tion as a Gross Injustice.
At a directors' meeting of the San
Francisco Retail Grocers held on
Monday, March 13, the following res
olutions, which were unanimously
passed, was introduced by Director J.
P. McGuire:
Whereas, The following statement appeared
In a San Francisco dally paper of March 2
in a letter addressed to the Joint executive
council. International Brotherhood of Teams
ters:
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 28, 1905.
To the Joint Executive Council, International
Brotherhood of Teamsters â Dear Sirs and
Brothers : In reply to your communication of
February 20 we are Instructed by our union,
to say that one year ago Division 205 was
face to face with serious difficulties. The
Citizens' Alliance, then in the floodtide of
its Influence, the Retail Grocers' Association,
as a part of that infamous organization, held
a meeting with the Wholesale Grocers' Asso
ciation and decided, in pursuance of their
policy of union crushing, that all credit should
be withdrawn from every member of the Car
men's Union as soon as a strike was declared,
and that further supplies would be refused
r.ny retailer who disregarded this rule. Mer
chants who had fattened for years upon out
trade were thus lined against us. Very re
spectfully yours,
DIVISION NO. 205. AMALGAMATED ASSO

F. G. Shallenberg. W. H. Ewing. W. J.
Davidson and A. Anderson, committee.
Whereas. The foregoing is grossly and
maliciously untrue In so far as the San Fran
cisco Retail Grocers are concerned; and
Whereas, The statements referred to ara>
calculated to Injure the business of some of
our members; be It
Resolved. That our secretary be InÂ«tructel
to write to the San Francisco daily papers
contradicting the falsehoods referred to and
that, a copy of these resolutions be sent the
joint executive council. International Brother

WALTER KKIjLY ELECTED
MAJOR OF THE FIRST
Succeeds to Command of Battalion
Recently Relinquished by
George Fllmer.
At a meeting of the officers of the
First Infantry Regiment, N. G. C. at
the Pagre-street armory last evening.
Captain Walter >J. Kelly was elected
major of the Second Battalion of the"
organization by a unanimous vote.
Major Curzon, by orders from Second.
Brigade headquarters, convened the
meeting and presided at the election,
which was unique in the history of
the regiment by reason of the fact
that perfect harmony prevailed.
Major Kelly, as the vote plainly sug
gested last evening, is exceedingly
popular among the 'officers and men
of the First. He succeeds George Fil
mer, who was recently elected colonel.

D'ALBERT'S ART
GIVES RISE TO
VARYING VIEWS
"Glorious!"
"He's got to show me."
"Did you ever hear such Beethoven?"
"If that's Schumann I don't know
it when I see it."
"Don't care if I never hear any une
I else."
"No poetry."
So what is a poor critic to do! These
â  are a few of the things I heard coming
i down the steps of the Alhambra The- j
ater last night after the first DAlbert
recital, and I heard more at the foot
of them, where excited knots of mu
sicians were hammer and tonging it
about the pianist. No such strong lik
1 ing and disliking rÂ»erhar>s has been
I aroused by any single pianistic perfor- j
mance given here for years. The wise \
ones, those who have heard this small ;
: titan before here, in Paris, in Berlin, ;
say "Wait." They say: "Wait until j
Thursday, if this gigantic small person \
does not then feel wholly in Schumann ;
or Chopin mood, wait until Saturday. ;
j Meantime be grateful for some slices j
of the biggest yianism you are likely i
to get. Remember, too, that of views i
there are others than yours; that a big j
man's conception of a big thing may '
possibly be as valuable as yours, and
that he certainly has a right to it."
After all, all criticism resolves itselft
into simply as some one has said: "I
like it. . I do not like it." And the more :
individual the staff criticized the more â 
diverse the opinions. Even D' Albert's â 
Beethoven, in which metier he has been j
long accepted master, was fought over. |
The storm center was the andante, read
BOt in the usual placid fashion, but (
with resounding echoes of the storm |
and stress of the preceding movement. ]
It was wholly logical but entirely un- ;
usual. So, no one else has played it in j
my small experience. Logical again ia
Us usual reading as a churchly moment i
of calm between the emotional wilds j
of the first and last movements. It's j
as you like it, and I enjoyed the D'Al
bert edition. The pianist's reading of j
the allegro I found intensely, brilliantly j
dramatic; the royal tneme royally de- i
livered, the orchestral bass orchestrally
treated, and the whole thing technically !
unimpeachable. The finale M. d' Albert !
took somewhat more slowly in the be- !
ginning than one is accustomed to, but ;
ended up in a sweeping climax of j
pcrwer and speed.
Somehow one does not think of D'AJ- :
berts virtuosity until you get him
among the Lizst fireworks, but it is of
the massive, compelling, Rosenthal ,
kind. A gentle, smiling little gentle- ,
man, five feet, nothing much, he has '
the power of several De Pachmanns.
I don't remember anywhere a more
glittering thrill than in the Rubinstein
. "Barcarolle," nor octaves so heroically
i sure as those in the "big" Chopin
i "Polonaise." Peculiarly delicious again
! is D' Albert's light, yet clinging non
j legato, and he has all the .dynamic
range at his command. With those
i Chopin octaves (op. 53) the polonaise ;
became a new "Ride of the Valkyries."
The nocturne, op. 9, No. 3, the other
I Chopin example, was charmingly I
played In virile, straightaway fash-
I ion, not poetically, but sanely and !
j finely.
And then came the Schumann "Car
neral." It was for this that Mr. d'Al
bert's admirers had to pour forth their
most ardent apologies. Essentially ro
i mance, its essential spirit was lack
' ing. It was hasty, breathless, wanting 1
;in finesse and elegance. Its accents !
j were sometimes even savage â though j
J for M. d'Albert's impeccable rhythms j
I one Is greatly grateful. Its basses, too,
i frequently overpowered its treble mcl- ,
' odies, and its general effect was of a
mood ajee with the composer's. Tet
I those in the know swear by D'Albert's
! Schumann. The movement was, how
1 ever, encored in a fashion as compell
; ing as D'Albert's own, and a charm
! lngly tranquil Chopin "Berceuse" fol
i lowed.
Mr. d'Albert's own scherao proved
i delightful in every way and a Liszt j
scherzo and march closed the pro- j
gramme. The house throughout, !
though not as large as it should have
been, outdid a Tivoli house in noise,
' and the D' Albert fight is on. The next
; recital is to-morrow night.

change. Much attention Is given in conse
quence to the discussion at measures of oppo- I
Fition. The consideration of the subject held ,
its part in causing the railing- oft of activity;
in the trading. The $50,000,000 bond issue by ,
the Pennsylvania Railroad was just half as ,
much as speculative' rumor had pointed to. and !
the movement of the stock Indicated that this :
moderation was a disappointment to the hold- !
ers- of the security. The changes were, . still
running on the varying rumors of mergers,
combinations and dividend increases, especially
affecting the Yanderbllt group. .Smelting

in some of the closely held high-priced stocks. '
I^ackawanna rising on trivial buying- to 4<<O
Ontario and Western's movement was renewed c
strongly in the late dealing without further '
new developments and helped to break the ef
fect of the active profit taking in progress
which .made the closing irregular. National â 
banks will pay to-morrow the 15 per cent in
stallment of Government deposits held by
them, thus completing the r*eent call, but the
money mark*? was fairly undisturbed by this ;
preparation.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
â  CHICAGO, March 14â the opening ssnti
ment in the wheat pit was somewhat divid
ed, â¢ the- May . option being firm. " while distant
deliveries were rather weak. Opening quota
tions on May were %c lower to 1% higher at
SI 12% to $1 14%. July was oft a shade to
Vi@U<s at 92% cto 93c. Rain and snow '
throughout the West- and Southwest formed |
the basis of the weakness of > the >> July option. ;
Reports from the winter wheat " section mdi- I
cate that the crop is in excellent condition, j
advices from Oklahoma being that prospects
are the best in six years. May was in demand !
at the start from scattered buyers, .but with
pit traders persistent sellers of July the May
option soon : lost its firmness, - declining â¢ along 1
with July. A ; factor that brought â  out some !
additional selling was an increase of 2,000,000 ,
bushels in the world's visible supply as shown I
by Bradstreet's. The lowest point for May j
was reached at $1 12%. July sold off to 92 % -'â 
Late in' the day the market developed consid- i
erable firmness, the strength of corn being thÂ© |
main . reason .for the. improved ' demand, , al
though news from the Northwest was I consid- i
ered bullish. May closed at $1 13% : and July 1
at !>3Vi@e3%c. ; . . ; - â  ' / Jf
Sentiment in the corn pit was decidedly ;
bullish and prices of all deliveries ; made . good ,
gains May closed at 49?4@49%0. V ' ?
The strength of corn held â¢ the oat market I
firm, but trading was extremely light. They j
closed up H@%c at 32%@32Kc :> <
Provisions were strong on an active demand j
from ehorts. At . the close May pork waa up
17.c . : lard was up 10c, and ribs were 7%c ,
higher. --..'-: â 'â -,;-â *" .â â :; :>;']

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
There was no further decline in Butter,
though a large quantity^ delayed by the recent
storm, came in. There are still northern or
i ders on the market and they are absorbing
I what the local trade does not take, so ther?
lis no accumulation of stock. Cheese is fairly
I steady at last week's decline.
Eggs were also unchanged. Some dealers
â  considered that the market had reached Its
limit for the present and became weak sellers,
while others continued to ask full prices.
Some continued to buy in the interior for stor
age, while others called off their buyers and
withdrew from the field. So It will be seen
that different houses regarded the situation in
different light*. It was purely a mattsr of
judgment. Receipts were very large, as they
Included liberal lines delayed by thÂ« rscent
storm.
Receipts were 115.900 lbs Butter. 2294 cases
. Eggs and 16.100 lbs Cheese.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Aside from the special auction sale of six
carload's of Oranges which wer* delayj in
tr*isit by the recent storm, the fruit market
was devoid of feature and generally weak.
Stocks of Oranges consisted chiefly of large
sized Navels, which were being pressed for sals
at Irregular rates, while the small aises were
closely cleaned up and firm. Offerings" in the
auction room included a straight carload of
extra fancy stock from Redlands and the prices
were as follows: Fancy $1 40@2 05; .choice,
TseiiJl 40; Htandarus. Oo'cS'l. The top price
for fancy fruit was obtained only for one
small lot of desirable sizes. Stocks of Apples
were liberal and there was continued dullness
In the lower grades.

Hidc>s, Tallow, Wool and Hops.
The new Wool clip is coming In very slowly
and not In sufficient quantity tr> establish quo
tations. Buyers are holding off and the mar
ket accordingly remains nominal.
Hops are lower, but are showing more ac
tivity at the decline. Late mail advices from
New York say:
"Owing to action of English growers 1a
pooling their Hops Inquiries were being re
ceived from exporters by New York growers
for the submission of samples on their re
maining Blacks. This development had a fa
vorable influence upon growers up the State,
and they were holding their remaining supplies
more firmly. Coast advices reported light of
ferings of Hops and a steady market. The de
mand from brewers continued to be reported
as light.
"According to advices received from the
coast, hop yards are being plowed and put In
shape for spring work. Growers report their
yards in good condition, especially those that
were set out last year and the year before. If
the season is a good one Oregon's Hop crop, it
is reported, will be a record-breaker."
Xo further variations In Hides appear. Dry
stoi k is firm and moving off well, while salt
ed is easy.

FOUR FISHING VESSELS
ESCAPE BY A MIRACLE
Trawling Tugs Are Buffeted by the Storm
W;th the wind blowing nearly a hun
dred miles an hcrur and the sea boiling
like a maelstrom four fishing tuge were
tossed and battered in Drakes Bay dur
ijig the etorm of Sunday night. The
little vessels that escaped destruction
by a mira< i<- art-: The Henrietta, the
X". 6. Grant, the Farragut and the
Columbia.
The Grant had the narrowest escape.
When thL hurricane struck her the
6mall boats were torn from their fas
tenings. Scrme of them were swept
overboard. One of the life boats was
jammed against 'he wheel of the Grant,
disabling the steering gear and leav
ing the little tup and its crew at the
â¢he elements.
the Henrietta were four who had
come for pleasure, guests of Captain
Nelson. One of them Emil Schneider,
a steward at the Marine Hospital, was
cashed against the mast by a heavy
wave. One of his ribs was broken.
While the storm howled and the little
: was tossed like a bit of drift
wood he clung to a ringbolt with the
grasp of a drowni..g man.
neidei's three companions were
Â«. harlep A. Stowell. of the Marine Hos
pital; Paul E. Squires, a pharmacist,
and Julius Beryes. All four agree that
have been nearer death than they
ever were before. They went out with
the fishing fleet for a sensation and ex
that they do not care
to have repeated.
The four tugs started out before
dawn on Sunday. They began to travel
toward Drakes Bay. Shortly before
noon the skies took on an angry
aspect. The old fishermen became
dubious.
Suudenly the storm burst in earnest.
The little tugs were at one moment on
th> summit of a mountain of water â
at the next they were in a gulf, from
vhith it seemed they never would
emerge.
All through the afternoon the little
boats were tossed about in the angry
waters. All tried to make for Drakes
Bay. They reached the haven almost
at dusk. It was then that a heavy
vav e djsabled the Grant's steering
gear. The helpless vessei was rapidly
being carried into the surf. Her anchor
was dropped, but the little boat con
tinued to drift to what seemed certain
destru' I
One of her masts fell with a rash
that chilled the hearts of the crew.
With white laces they clung to any
thing that would give them a hold,
wondering when the end would come.
The booming of the surf became louder
and louder every moment.
Suddenly the vessel lurched. The
r had at last fastened
the bottom, and it clung
tens. Pbe Grant was saved.
Through the night the little fleet

SELBY ASSERTS HE DID
NOT HAVE FAIR TRIAL
Man Who Shot at Judge Hebbard
Sentenced to Serve Seven Years
in San Quentin.
Isaac Selby, convicted by a jury in
Judge Lawlor's court on a charge of
assault to murder for taking a shot at
Judge J. C. B. Hebbard on November
28, was sentenced yesterday to serve
seven years in San Quentin. His re
quest to be deported to Australia to
serve his time there had previously
been denied.
When Selby was asked if he had
any legal reason why sentence should
not be passed upon him he said: "I
did not receive a fair trial. I was de
nied my constitutional rights to de
fend myself. A plea of insanity was
introduced without my consent. I am
not morally guilty of the crime
charged against me. I did not intend
to kill the Judge. I had a different
idea in my mind and that was to pre
serve the unity of my family."
After the Judge had passed sen
tence upon him Selby said: "I ap
peal from your judgment and will
take an exception." The exception
was noted and Selby asked for a stay
of ten days to consult an attorney,
which was granted.

LACK OF SPACE
FOR THE INSANE
Lunacy Commission Clashes
With the Managers of
the Agnews State Asylum
THEIK OPINIONS DIFFER
Medical Superintendent Says
Furnishing of New Cottage
Will Relieve the Crowding
Sheriffs are advised by Dr. Stocking,
medical Â«euperintendent of the Agnews
State Hospital, that the institution in
Santa Clara County is so crowded with
patients that women are sleeping on
the floors. The superintendent sug
gests that no more lunatics be sent at
the present time to Agnews. Contrary
orders, it is reported, are given by Dr.
Hatch c-f the State Commission in Lun
acy, who advises the Sheriffs to pay
no attention to the suggestions of Dr.
Stocking. It is remarked by business
men and medical experts that the
asylums in California for the care of
the insane are governed in a peculiar
fashion. Each institution has a board
of managers, and the managers cannot
do anything without consulting the
Commission of Lunacy, and the com
mission cannot do much withoutw ithout con
sulting the State Board of Charities,
and Corrections. It is the judgment of
many capable observers that the old
system of making the managers or
directors of an institution immediately
responsible to the Governor of the
State is much better than the present
plan.
It is acknowledged that the Agnews
Asylum under a board of managers, of
which Isaac Upham of San Francisco
is president, is one of the best managed
institutions of the State. Mr. Upham's
associates on the board o^ management
are J. R. Wilson of San Francisco, O.
A. Hale and Adolph Greeninger of San
Jose and Edward White of Watsonville.
There is some friction between the
board and certain officers of the Lun
acy Commission. The co-ttage system
of caring for patients has been ex
tended. Savings of money brought
about by an economical administration
of affairs and sums received for the
care of "pay patients" have enabled
the board to construct and equip four
cottages. The board favors the plan
of furnishing the cottages in a style
comfortable and attractive but not
luxurious. The Lunacy Commission
wants nothing but the cheapest and
most ordinary equipment. The argu
ment is advanced by the advocates
of comfort that the State is not called
on to pay for the furnishing. The ex
pense is met by the kinsfolk of the
patients, and they insist that the furni
ture of the rooms shall be comfortable
and to some degree attractive and
restful.
NAPA HAMPERED.
The State Commission in LujÂ»acy
consists of the Governor, Secretary of
State, Attorney General, secretary of
the State Board of Health and F. W.
Hatch, General Superintendent of State
Hospitals. The last named receives a
salary of $4000 per annum. The em
ployes of the commission are C. L. Par
dee, Eureka, secretary, $2400 per an
num; J. W. Stetson, attorney, $2400;
Charles F. Waymire, assistant secre
tary, $1800; E. E. Maxwell, clerk. $1000;
L. W. Kevane, clerk, $1000; Howard
Cook, porter, $480. In the absence of
the Governor from Sacramento the
Secretary of the State Board of Health
acts in his place. When the Attorney
General is absent the Assistant At
torney General acts in his place. No
provision is made for representing the
Secretary of State in the absence Â©f
that officer.
According to the Blue Book the State
Board of Charities and Corrections con
sists of Professor E. C. Moore, Andrew
M. Davis, Oscar K. Gushing and Rev.
Charles A. Ramm, San Francisco:
Rev. John K. McLean, Berkeley, and
W. C. Patterson, Los Angeles.
Reports come from Napa that the
trustees of the State Hospital for the
Insane in that county are constantly
hampered^ by the Commission in
Lunacy. It was remarked recently by
one of the managers: "We cannot
spend a dollar for the betterment of
the institution without the consent of
the Lunacy Commission. The man
agers are simply figureheads, having
no authority in the premises."
STOCKING'S STATEMENT.
Isaac Upham, president of the board
of managers of the Agnews State
Hospital, was asked yesterday con
cerning the reports of overcrowding
at Agnews. He advised that inquiries
should be addressed to Dr. Stocking,
the medical superintendent.
Subsequently the correspondent of
The Call at San Jose obtained the su
perintendent's version. The dispatch
from theie follows:
SAN JOSE March 14. â There are 1072 pa
tients at the Agnews Insane Asylum, of which
42*.Â» are women, and besides these there are
about twenty on leave of absence, who ara
liabl# to return at any tirn*. This is by far
thr largest number ever In the asylum. In
speaking of the crowded condition of the asy
lum to-day Dr. Stocking, the medical director,
said: "Yee. we are crowded, especially with
women patients, but this will be relieved with
in a month. About forty of the female pa
tients sleep yon the floor, but their beds are
comfortable and soft. Mattresses are under
them. A new cottage that will accommodate
one hundred women patients has Just been
completed and was accepted at the last meet-
Ing of the board of manaeers. We are nrw
furnishing the cottage and as soon aa pos
sible the patients will be moved into It. When
those that are now occupying 1 the Improvised
beds are provided for we will have about
eixty beds still left for women patients.
"I have been misquoted In regard to ship
ping back patients to San . Francisco. Last
month we received thirty-four women patients,
and for months they have been coming in
larger numbers than usual. San Francisco
and other counties in the central part of the
State have been sending large numbers here.
I told the San Francisco authorities that I
did not know just what I was going to do
with all the women and that I did not know
but that I would have to return to the counties
where they belonged the harmless and chronic
insane. The law provides for this returning
of that class of patients, which can be kept
in almshouses and hospitals. We have done
that before.
"All the hospitals for the Insane are full,
but I understand that there is room for soma
patients at the Ukiah Hospital. Agnews being
*" clone to San Francisco gets more than its
share of patients and consequently we are
always pretty full. The best of care is always
Riven the patients, and while we have hid
this temporary crowded condition none of the
insane has suffered for care and attention."

CHIEF WITTMAN
ON THE STAND
Tells Straightforward Story
of His Efforts to Stop
Gambling in Chinatown
TRIAL IS NEARLY ENDED
Two More Witnesses to Tes
tify for Defense and Case
Will Go to Commissioners
George W. Wittman, Sail Francisco's
suspended Chief of Police, was given
an opportunity last night to testify In
his own behalf before the Police Com
missioners and to deny in full the
charges brought against him of incom
petency and neglect of duty. The Chief
told a straightforward story of the
many attempts made by him to sup
press gambling in Chinatown and
maintained that it could not be done
except with the constant use of a large
force of men.
The questions of Wittman s attorney.
Congressman Kahn, brought iitn suc
cessively the record* made by Witt
man in the force, his efforts to im
prove the department and his un
tiring zeal for its welfare. When asked
by Kahn almost at the conclusion of
his testimony whether he had ever re
ceived a dollar from any source for
allowing police protection in China
town, the accused Chief solemnly an
swered: "I have never received a dol
lar from any man, white, brown or
yellow, for such purpose, nor have I
ever received a dishonest dollar, and
God knows I speak the truth."
When asked by Commissioner Rea
gan why he did not place more men in
Chinatown if the suppression of gam
bling required it, Wittman said that it
was but justice to the white taxpay
ers of the city that they should receive
police protection. "This department is
not large enough by three hundred men
to properly police the city and I did
not think it right to leave citizens and
homes unprotected in order to correct
the gambling propensities of Chinese."
Wittman also denied that he had
ever agreed to make any certain
number of arrests in a given raid, and
in response to a question told the Com
missioners that he last spoke with
Chan Cheung in 1901. Chan- Cheung
was virtually named as go-between for
the Chief in the testimony given in
the trial.
Detective Sergeant Thomas L. Ryan
told of his being ordered by Chief
Wittman to report on the gambling in
Chinatown in April, 1903, and took the
stand to explain his report made at
that time. He was corroborated by
Detective Charles H. Taylor, who ac
companied Ryan at the time. Detec
tive Sergeant George McMahon testi
fied to posting the Chief's proclamation
warning Chinese against paying prcf
tection mony. Two more witnesses
will be calleu by the defense and the
hearing will go on to-night at 9 o'clock.
WITTMAX'S TESTIMONY.
The accused Chief, called to the
stand for the first time to testify in his
own behalf, when asked by Kahn as to
his business, replied quickly, "Chief of
Police, under suspension at present."
Chief Wittman told of his appointment
to the force as patrolman in 1883; pro
motion to sergeant in 1888 and succes
sively lieutenant and captain in 1895
and elected Chief of Police in Novem
ber. 1901. 1 i-Q
During this time Wittman visited all
the cities of the United States equal to
or larger in size than San Francisco
and made a special study of police
methods. The witness said he knew
that San Francisco was better policed
than many larger cities in the Union.
The men are cleaner, neater, larger
and better disciplined than those in a
great many cities.
The Chief then went on to tell of the
purpose of his answer to the injunc
tion restraining the police from raid
ing gambling clubs in Chinatown. He
said that he used every possible means
to overcome the injunction and con
tinue the raids. One place was over
looked in the injunction and was im
mediately raided. The following day

a new injunction was issued to cover
the excepted place.
Chief Wittman then told of his de
tailing different sergeants to China
town in the vain endeavor to suppress
the gambling evil, and said that all,
with the exception of Sergeant Cook,
who spoke Chinese, were to a great ex
tent unsuccessful. Sergeant Cook
asked for his relief from duty, saying
that if he was compelled to stay he
would end in the hospital. The other
sergeants in turn were either relegated
for failure to suppress gambling or re
lieved after repeated request to the
Chief for transfer. Sergeant Cook,
wba is at present stationed in China
town, is the only sergeant to have been
assigned to the irksome detail a second
time.
APPOINTS SERGEANTS.
The first sergeant appointed by Witt
man on becoming Chief was Campbell.
|He was followed by Sergeant Cook.
j who practically received his police and
Chinatown /schooling under Wittman
I at a time when Wittman was a ser
geant in charge of the Chinatown
t squad.
After staying in Chinatown until al
most a wreck. Cook was relieved and
Sergeant Coogan appointed. Coogan
had been on the onerous detail barely
a month before he applied for relief
and got it. Sergeant Blank was the
next appointee and Chief Wittman told
of the circumstances connected with
his appointment. According to Chief
Wittman, Coogan and Blank have
been and are bitter enemies, and when
Coogan was relieved Wittman placed
Blank there, confident that the latter
would find out and report any delin
quencies of his predecessor.
MAYOR INVESTIGATES.
At this time the Mayor was making
an investigation and could find no evi
dence connecting the police with ac
cepting hush money. He suggested,
however, that a notice warning Chi
nese against paying money to any one
under promises of protection from
raiding be posted. This suggestion was
carried out and notices in Chinese and
English were posted under the super
vision of Detective Sergeant McMahon.
Sergeant Sylvester followed Blank in
Chinatown and was succeeded by
Christiansen, and soon afterward the
injunction, which lasted nine months,
was granted. Sergeant Ellis, who had
been twice promoted for bravery, and
had no stain on his record, was next
made Chinatown sergeant and received,
the Chief's fullest confidence. Ellis
was removed after Hutton made his
famous raid and Cook was reinstated.
Wittman testified that the Chinatown
quarter had always been a source of
anxiety to the heads of the department
and that Chiefs Crowley and Sullivan
had spent many a sleepless night over
its affairs. He then went on to tell of
the decrease in the number of gam
bling clubs and his own visits to
Chinatown in endeavoring to catch
gamblers unawares. After short cross
questioning by Reagan and Drinkhouse
the Chief was allowed to leave the
stand and an adjournment was taken
until 9 o'clock to-night.
Protests Against Sale.
Reba E. Wells, widow of the late
Asa R. Wells, has filed a protest in
the Superior Court against the peti
tion of Henry R. Root, executor, and
Susie H. Wells, executrix of the will
of the deceased, for leave to sell the
residence belonging to decedent's es
tate. In her protest Mrs. Wells says
that the debts of the estate only
amount to $22,868 57 and that this
sum can be paid through the sale of
the personalty if care is exercised.
She asks that a homestead in her fa
vor be decared on the residence prop
erty and that it be not sold to liqui
date the debts.
