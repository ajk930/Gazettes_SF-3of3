"When the car left the park terminus,

impossible for any more to get aboard.
All went well. until the vehicle reached
SWINGS AROUND CURVE.
Car No. 1017 of the Eddy street line,
heavily laden with passengers, struck
a curve at. the corner of Eighth avenue
and Clement street while running at a
high rate of speed yesterday afternoon.
Frederick Fendsen, a bartender, was
almost instantly killed; Sergeant Harry
Curran, a soldier stationed at Fort
Mason, was so badly hurt that he died
in a few hours, and a score more pas
sengers were injured by being hurled
to the pavement and agrainst another
car coming from an opposite direction
on an adjacent track. Several who
were injured are in a precarious con
dition and have been removed to hos
pitals.
The motorman, L. G. Reed, offers as
an excuse for the accident failure of
the brakes to work. Stories told by
many who were aboard the vehicle or
on the street near by are to the effect
that the carman applied his brakes too
late. They also say that the quick
time policy, which <â¢ is especially, in.
vogue on this branch of the* United
Railroads, is accountable for the affair.
Several â¢ accidents of a similar nature
have recently occurred in this section
of the city. Motormen on cars that run
to the park and cliff say that their time
schedules are constantly being short
ened, and surprise v is expressed that
more fatalities are not the result. Of
ficials of the company are. reticent as
to details, and their agents 'were quick
ly on the scene cautioning employes
not to talk. An investigation will be
made to-day and the responsibility
fixed. 1 *
As soon as the hews of the accident
reached; the Park, Police: Station Cap

scene and 'sent air available policemen
The wounded, some of them uncon-'.

after he was picked up. His skull was
fractured "and Â¦ he never' regained '< con
sciousness, n Sergeant Harry Ciirran
also suffered from a fracture of -the.
skull andrinternal 1 injuries. Despite the
care of ' physicians ' he died four hours
afterward at the. French Hospital..
Clement street, on Eighth avenue. The
speed ,- was exceedingly high and the
passengers. were, unaware of the dan
ger that awaited them until the car
suddenly swung around the curve, keel
ing over to one side for a moment and
scraping another car that was running
slowly from the opposite direction.
The scene instantly became one of
wild. commotion. The momentum of the
car caused people to be thrown about
in. every direction, and nearly every
one on the left side of the car was
hurledinto the street The, southbound
car was traveling very slowly, and was
about at the side of the other j when
most of the people were, thrown off.
In the- little space between the two

LIST OF DEAD AND INJURED.
The force with which the old lady's
head struck the car crushed it. Dr.
Abrams. into whose drug store the old
Â¦woman was taken, says that she was
instantly killed.
Mrs. Dellwig was a resident of the
German Old Ladies' Home at FruitvaJe.
She was over 65 years of age and feeble
in health- She had been visiting Mrs.
Dellwig and the two started out to visit
another old lady whom they had known
as girls.
Albert Rhine, a boy, says the car was
moving Elowly when the two old la
dies tried to cross. Mrs. â¢ Dellwig
clutched Mrs. Bertram by the arm, he
says. Then the latter staggered and
fell, her head striking forcibly against
the car. This Etory is corroborated by
others.
Bewildered by clanging bells and pass
ing cars at the corner of Fillmore and
McAllister streets last night. Mrs. Dora
Bertram, an eged German, fell in front
of a 'west-bound McAllister Etreet car
and was almost instantly killed.
Mrs. Bertram, who was over 65 years
cf age, was visiting in company with
a companion of about the same age,
Mrs. Nina Dellwig of 270 Ninth avenue.
The two old ladies dismounted from a
Fillmore street car at about 6:30 o'clock
and hurried to catch a McAllister street
car.
The cable car was crowded with peo
ple bound for the Chutes, and the aged
pair Etarted to cross before it in hope
of finding room on the other side. "When
they were directly in front a bell sig
naled "go ahead," and the old ladies
became bewildered.
Mrs. Dellwig seized Mrs. Bertram
by the arm and attempted to drag her
from the track. Mrs. Bertram seemed
Â©vercojne by fright and her limbs
gave way. She fell and her head
etruck against the car just as Grip
man Elmer Simmons brought it to a
lull stop.
Mrs. Bertram was quickly carried
to the drug store of C. J. Abrams at
the corner of Fillmore and McAllister
streets. Life was extinct before she
reached the place.
Her companion. Mrs. Dellwig, who
has suffered for many years from
heart failure, became hysterical. "For
fifty years I have known her." she
moaned. "Oh. she is not badly hurt,
is Ehe?" Fearing for her reason the
old woman was assured that Mrs.
Bertram was only slightly, injured..
Mrs. Dellwig was taken. to the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital, where she re
mained until quieted . by assurances
that her old friend was only slightly
Injured.
Though there were four crowded
cars at the crossing at the time" of the
accident, and though many people were
on the comers, stories of the accident
axe conflicting. Some maintain that
the car against which Mrs. Bertram
Jell was not In motion at the time.
Elmer Simmons, the motorman, says
he did not see the old woman try to
cross, but maintains that his car. was
stationary when the shouts, arose that
told him of the accident. He was ar
rested last night and booked at the
City Prison on a charge of manslaugh
ter.

While hopes are still entertained that
Port Arthur may be able to hold out
until the appearance of the Baltic fleet,
the question of, the fall of that strong

The only thing expected of the Port

harbor and inflict as much damage as
possible upon Admiral Togo's fleet.
Such ships as escape are expected tc
make their way to Vladivostok, where
the repairs on the cruiser Bogatyr are
understood to have been practically
completed and those on the Rossia and
Gromoboi are nearing completion.
The question of the war in the Fax

St. PETERSBURG. Oct. 3, 2 a. m.â
Announcement is made that Emperor
Nicholas will visit Reval on Tuesday
to bid farewell to the Baltic squadron.
After months of preparation and sev
eral false starts it is believed that the
squadron is at last on the eve of it3
departure upon its long journey. A di
vision in the Admiralty has existed
throughout the period of preparation
regarding the advisability of sending
out the squadron, but with the decision
to double the size of the Manchurian
army and press the war with vigor thÂ«
logic" of those who for months have in
sisted that every available ship should
be dispatched to the Far East has final
ly prevailed. The argument that no
complete victory over the Japanese is
possible unless the command of the sea
is wrested from them could not be
overcome, and though much valuable
time has been lost and the moment
seems inauspicious, it is officially inti
mated that an Irrevocable decision has
been taken to dispatch the Baltic fleet,
even if the Port Arthur squadron
should be annihilated before It3 arrival
there.
It is realized that the squadron, which
on "paper Is about equal in fighting
strength to that of the Japanese fleet.
will be much better able to encounter
them now than in the spring, after the
Japanese ships have had all winter to
clean, repair and refit.

RUSSIANS AGGRESSIVE.
Make Attempt to Capture Heavy Guns
at Pigeon Bay.
CHEFU, Oct. 2.â Severe fighting, , the
Russians being the aggressors, occurred
September 28 and 29 on the, west shore
of Liaoti Promontory, near Pigeon Bay,
according* to a report brought by Chi
nese who left Port Arthur September
30. The Russians were apparently at
tempting to capture the heavy guns
which the Japanese have mounted in
that vicinity. The Russians were in
considerable force and they made sev
eral sorties, dragging field artillery with
them. They were unsuccessful, how
ever.
Three junks with 160 coolies arrived
here to-day. They left Port Arthur be
cause they were forced to carry the
wounded and bury the dead. They were
also afraid that eventually they would
have no food, although rice is plentiful
now according to their story. They fur
ther say that the Russians lost heavily
during the attacks of September 19 and
23, but the Japanese loss was much
heavier. One of the coolies, who had
been a water carrier, showed a wound
ed hand that he received September 22.
He and four companions went to a well
in the center of the town. A shell burst
and killed three of his companions and
wounded the fourth one. The Russian
ships were silent during the battle, and
the hitherto unused merchant ships
were as a result of the fight turned into
hospitals.
Several of the Chinese who were em
ployed in carrying the dead say that
the dead were so numerous that "they
were unable to form anything like an
estimate of the number who fell in at
tacking and defending the supplement
ary forts n#ar Itzshan. Since,the bat
tle both sides continue to shell at in
tervals daily. The Russians make many
small sorties against the Japanese
trenches. Small positions frequently
change hands. The Chinese say they
were compelled to bury the dead by
stealth at night, for the reason that the
Japanese would fire on them.
DAILY SKIRMISHES OCCUR.
Russians Make Efforts to
Regain Old Positions.
TOKIO, Oct. 2. â The Russians are
reported to be desperately endeavor
ing to retake their lost positions, in
cluding Fort Kuropatkin, in the hope
of restoring the water supply of Port
Arthur. They are said to have re
peatedly assaulted the Japanese after
shelling from neighboring forts and
batteries. The Japanese continue to
hold the positions. Both sides are
said to have suffered severely.
The newly mounted heavy Japanese
guns are said to command the. entire
harbor. The position of the remnant
of the Russian Port Arthur fleet is
said to be precarious and it is believed
that the vessels must soon emerge or
be destroyed.
Advices from Manchuria are to the
effect that the Japanese and Russian
outposts and scouts continue in close
contact south, southeast and east â¢ of
Mukden. Skirmishes are occurring
dally and an aggressive general action
is expected soon.
It is believed that the general en
gagement will take place near t Tie
Pass and that General Kuropatkin is
holding Mukden and positions along
the Hun River merely to temporarily
check the Japanese advance.
Snow has fallen in the mountains

Motorman Reed was taken into cus
tody on instructions \ from Captain
Gleason and taken to the Hall of Jus
tice, where he was charged with man
slaughter. Reed says his car was not
going along Eighth avenue at any more
than an ordinary rate of speed and
when it approached Clement street he
says he applied the brakes, but for
some reason they refused to work and
before he could do anything the car
had reached the curve and swung
around it at an extraordinary rate of
speed.
SOLDIER TELLS HIS STORY.
Charles Stutz, a private in Company
27, Coast Artillery, stationed at the
Presidio, was a passenger on the ill
fated car and had a good view of the
accident from where he was standing
on the outside of the vehicle. Stutz
declares that the car on which he was
riding collided with the side of the ap
proaching vehicle at the curve where
the accident occurred. Stutz said :
"I was returning from the ball
grounds in the park in company with
Rollander and Sergeant Curren. The
car was loaded with people and It was
with difficulty that we managed to
cling on. As It neared the corner of
Clement street, the motorman put on
his breaks, but failed to check the
speed. It was going at a fearful rate,
abont forty-five miles an hour, I should
Judge.
"The passengers did not seem to real
ire their danger, and all of a sudden
the car gave 'a lunge as it neared the
corner and swung to one side. Another
car was coming slowly around the
curve in the opposite direction and our
car bumped into its side. People were
hurled in every direction; but, strange
to say, I was not thrown from my po
sition.
"There w r ere cries of pain and agony
from the wounded as they lay on the
street- All the passengers on the car
seemed panic stricken and a wild rush
was made to get off as quickly as pos
sible. I did the best I could to aid the
Injured and then ran to the telephone
to ring up the Emergency Hospital.
TELEPHONE SERVICE SLOW.
"I could not get the line for several
minutes. The girl demanded a nickel,
which I did not have, my money being
in my coat, which I left with one of
the passengers. I vainly pleaded .with
the woman to give me the line, telling
her that it was a case of life and death,
but she turned a deaf ear to my plead
ings and I 'could not get the line till
a man came to my rescue with a nickel.
"The passengers were given no warn
ing before the accident happened. It
came very suddenly and no one knew
what had occurred till it was all over.
A number of our baseball team tried
to catch this car, but It was so crowded
that they -could not board it and there
fore I think many lives were saved, as
all these men would have had to cling
on to the platforms and some at them
would surely have been killed or in
jured."
John Clark. 502 Stockton street, was
also riding on the platform of the car
at the time of the accident. He says
the car was going at a high rate of
speed and that the motorman was un
able to bring it to a standstill. Clark
is not sure about the collision, but
thinks there was none. Clark said:
"I. was riding on the outer right
hand platform and thereby escaped in-

were deprived of milk, complained bit

Only about thirty people were ar

Two hundred had announced their in

GUmr IS ADMITTED.
As an immediate and very important result
of the investigation this gigantic combination
and conspiracy has been Â¦ broken up and its
power for evil-doing in the future utterly de
stroyed. As further and ultimate results, the
fraudulent selections will alf-'be cancelled and
the lands covered thereby restored to the pub
lic domain, and it is the confident belief of
the Secretary of the Interior and of the offi
cials having charge of the prosecution growing
out of the investigation that the guilty parties
will be convicted and such punishment meted
out to them as will not only be commensurate
with the magnitude of their crimes, but will
serve as a warning to evil-doers In the fu
ture. â¢.-.'. Â¦ Â¦ Â¦
The defendants in these 1 indictments were
immediately arrested, one, John A. Benson, in
the State of New York; two, Frederick A. Hyde
and Henry P. Dimond, In the State of Cali
fornia, and the fourth, Joost H. Schneider, in
the District of Columbia. The last named is
now held under heavy ball for his appearance
for trial. Proceedings under section 1014 of
the revised statutes were at once instituted
In the States of California and New York to
eecure the removal of the defendants arrested
in those State* to the District of Columbia for
trial. These proceedings have been diligently
prosecuted, and 'in California have resulted in
decisions by both the United States District
and Circuit Courts for the Northern District of
California sustaining the conspiracy Indictment
and ordering the defendants, Hyde and Dimond,
removed to the District of Columbia for trial.
They have appealed to the Supreme Court of
the United States, and it is the purpose of the
Government to secure in that court an ad
vancement of the case on the docket and a
hearing of the appeals at the earliest possible
date. The defendants are under heavy ball -to
answer the . decision of the Supreme Court
when finally rendered. Upon the indictment
for bribery, John A. Benson has also been held
for removal to the District - of I Columbia for
trial and has appealed to the Supreme Court.
Upon the conspiracy indictment, removal pro
ceedings are still pending against said Benson
in Ni-w York, with the expectation that they
will be concluded at an early date with like
favorable '.result. The action of the Secretary
of the Interior in suspending the ' selections
and entries of the public lands involved in the
conspiracy, and . in refusing to/fssue further
patents upon such selections and entries, is
fully sustained by the decisions of both the
District -.. and -. Circuit courts of the UnlteS
States for the Northern District of California,
above referred -to.
DEFENDANTS ARRESTED.
While hundreds of thousands of public lands
were involved in the scheme, only a small
portion thereof â less than 40,000 acres â had
been patented at the time of the discovery of
the fraud by the Secretary of the Interior.
By the Secretary's direction the further issuing
of patents upon the selections and entries in
volved was immediately stopped and all such
selections and entries were suspended, which
suspension still remains in force. The Govern.
rnent Is, therefore, in no danger of | further
loss of its public lands through the said scheme.
The fraudulent business of the conspirators
has been completely broken up, and their ne
farious practices are now at an end.-
1. .The indictment, in February, 1903, in
the District of Columbia of Frederick A. Hyde,
John A. Benson and Henry P. Dimond of San
Francisco and Jooee H. Schneider of Tucson,
Ariz., under section 6440 of the Revised Stat
tues, for conspiracy to defraud the United
States of large quantities of its public lands,
and the indictment in December, 1002, in the
District of Columbia, of John A. Benson for
bribery of public officials In connection with
such conspiracy. The leading spirits in this
conspiracy are Hyde and Benson and their
scheme to defraud the Government was of gi
gantic proportions. -It involved an attempt to
secure titles to' hundreds of thousands' of acres
of . the public | lands . of I the United States in
the. various public lands' States and the Terri
tories of Arizona and New Mexico under the
provision of the act of Congress approved
Juno 4, 1697, in exchange for State school
lands lying within the limits of United States
forest res-erven established in . the States of
California and Oregon.
The titles to these school lands were ac
quired by and on behalf of Hyde and Benson,
in violation of the laws of said States relating
to the disposal of school lands and in a grossly
illegal and fraudulent manner, by means of
false and forged applications, affidavits and
other documents required by the laws of those
States to be executed and filed in connection
with the . purchase of school lands, thereby
rendering such titles falee, fraudulent and
worthless and by making and securing to be
made false forced relinquishments to the United
States of such said false, fraudulent and worth
less titles, and by selecting other lands be
longing to the United States outside of forest
reserves in exchange for the titles thus frau
dulently obtained and relinquished to the
United States.
The act referred to provides, among other
things, that the owner of the lands within a
forest reserve may relinquish the same to the
United States and select other lands in lteu
thereof outside of forest reserves. Briefly stated,
the object of the conelpracy was to obtain good
titles from the .United States for its public
lands outside of forest reserves. In exchange
for false, fraudulent and worthless titles to
school lands secured by the conspirators from
eald States within forest reserves.
CONSPIRACY IS CHARGED.
These difficulties have been successfully met
and overcome and the tactics resorted to by
the parties criminally involved and by their
friends have been circumvented and defeated
at all points. The determination of the Sec
retary of the Interior has been from the be
ginning that the investigation should be thor
ough and complete, and nothing has been left
undone to accomplish such result. The fraud
ulent operations have been carried on chiefly
in the States of California and Oregon, but
have not been confined to those States. â¢ In
many instances the conspirators have reached
out into other States. Their schemes were
broadly and deeply laid and the task of un
earthinc them has been one of great diffi
culty.
While only about elehteen months have
elapsed since the investigation was commenced,
the practical results thus far attained are both
gratifying and encouraging. They may be
summed up aa follows:
These charges are utterly without foundation
in fact. The investigation has been in the
hands of competent officers of the Government
from the beginning and has been conducted,
under the direction of the Secretary of the In
terior, with the utmost possible speed consist
ent with thoroughness; the prosecutions, where
Indictments have been found, have been and
are being vigorously pressed, and at no time
has there been any attempt to deprive the
public of the fullest information as to the
progress or status of such prosecutions, or as
to any matter in connection therewith.
The leading* spirits in the fraudulent trans
actions brought to light are mostly 'men who
have occupied positions of Influence and high
standing, both socially and politically, and
many of them are men of large wealth. They
have thrown many obstacles in the way, which
have required time, patience, constant effort,
determination and courage on the part of those
ha v Hi a; charge of the investigation to over
come. They have diligently sought, in season
and out of season, to thwart the purpose of
the Investigation and to control its result ta
forable to themselves.
Charges are being made and freely circu
lated by thv opponents of the administration
to the effect that the Investigation ol the
land frauds by the Interior Department is not
being seriously and diligently conducted; that
criminal prosecutions connected with the in
vestigation are not being pressed with such
vigor aa to manifest a determination to bring
the guilty parties to speedy Justice; and that
an air of secrecy pervades the' department,
making it difficult to obtain information as
to the progress and present status of tha
work. '. Â«Â¦
WASHINGTON. Oct. 2.â Secretary of
the Interior Hitchcock to-night gave

the programme outlined above. Ac
cording to this information the Baltic
fleet will be started for the Far East,
but the continuation of the voyage to
its destination will depend primarily
upon how the ships' themselves stand
the test of actual sailing, and, secondly,
upon developments in â¢ the Far Bast.
Should all go well with the squadron
or. the voyage and Rear Admiral Wlren
be able to strike a telling blow at Ad
miral Togo, even if half his ships go
to the bottom,- the Baltic squadron will
be hurried; on with all speed possible.
If defects develop in the vessels or if
Wiren fails utterly, the squadron can
at the worst return and await the com
pletion of other ships 1 now building.
Nothing, it is argued, will be lost and
much may be gained by the mere de
parture of the squadron; and the fact
that it may have to be reckoned with
later may make Admiral Togo "wary
about risking his ships when the time
comes for Rear Admiral "Wiren's sortie,
and thus give the latter a better op
portunity to escape. .

Albert Mueller, a cloak manufacturer
on Mission street, lies in a precarious
condition at the German Hospital.

for his heroic effort to save the life
of his five-year-old son Lester.
Mueller and the child were seated on
the outside of the .car and when the

turned his thoughts to his son. He
caught the youngster and tried to Jump
from the car when it was still going.
He was hemmed In by the crowd, how
ever, and could not get out Mueller
still held on to his frightened son and
botn* were hurled to the pavement.
Father and son were picked up in
an unconscious condition and taken to
a nearby store. The child recovered
consciousness first and when the father
regained his senses the ambulance ar
rived from the Park Emergency Hos
pital. Mueller insisted on being taken
to his home, but finally agreed to go to
the German hospital.
The child was badly shaken up and
suffered a slight concussion of the
brain. Some of his relatives arrived
soon after the accident and removed
the little one to his home, 1424 Devis
adero street, where he is being treated
by a doctor.
Mueller is in a serious condition. He
is suffering from a number of bruises
about the head and body and Internal
injuries that are likely to be serious.
His wife is prostrated by the sudden

Mueller will recover, but his injuries
will not be cured soon.

"The passengers made a rush to get
off when the crash came, and it is
miraculous that more of them were not

than one hundred persons on our car
at the time. It looked to me as if the
brakes of the car . were defective, for
the motorman saw the danger when
he was a half a block away from the
curve and kept pulling and tugging at
the brakes in a frantic effort to bring
the car to a standstill, but instead of
stopping, it gained speed at every
revolution of the wheels."
Frank Kenny, a lad residing at 2717
Pine street, was another eye-witness of
the tragedy. Kenny was standing at
the southwest corner of Clement street
and Eighth avenue and had a clear
view of the accident. According to his
story, the ill-fated car was approach

in a good position to view the accident
and is positive in his statements.
Other eye-witnesses are divided as to

with the line at Liaoyang. Its com

on the indecision displayed In the Jap

around Mukden has been abandoned
and that they are awaiting reinforce

There are signs of weakness. The Jap

The Chronicle's Liaotung correspond

Thousands of the buttons had been

Nebraska and other Western States,
while the gold faced buttons were re
called and distributed elsewhere.
CHICAGO, Oct. 2.â A blunder has
caused the Democratic National Com

TACOMA, Oct. 2. â A whimsical
case of suicide was that of Captain
John C. Foley, whose body was found
to-day. Several days ago he obtained
his discharge from the Soldiers' Home
at Orting and started for San Fran
cisco. At Tacoma he visited a resort,
where all his money was stolen.
Though 70 years old he refused all
help and bravely walked back to
Orting. Â»
The trip nearly killed the old man.
Upon arriving he found he had $15
tied around his neck in a tobacco
pouch. The recollection of the des
perate hardship of traveling as he did
when he might have ridden on the
train maddened him so that he bought
a revolver with the money and shot
himself.
Foley has excited much attention
among the medical fraternity through
the fact that he was shot in the head
during the war and the bullet re*
mained inbedded in his brain to the
day of his death without occasioning
any Inconvenience or destroying the
functional power.

RENO, Nev.. Oct. 2. â George Sax
ton, a very prominent young man of
Reno and a graduate of the University
of Nevada, Is reported to be stricken
with pneumonia on the Amargosa
Desert, about eighty miles south of
Goldfleld. .His condition is so serious
that he cannot be moved, although he
is on one of the bleakest parts of the
great Nevada Desert. A messenger
brought the word to Goldfleld early
this morning. A- relief party was Im
mediately organized by Carl Stoddard,
an old friend of Saxton's, and sent to
the sick man. On account of the re
cetn storms In that section it will be
dicult to render aid. The country also
is very rough and it may take a week
before he can be moved. If he still
lives, to Goldfleld.
Several weeks ago Saxton and a
party of young men left to prospect
the Amargosa Desert. This is the
first word received since they left.

President Roosevelt is an exceedingly Inter
esting, picturesque and forcible character, who
would have found a most congenial and glorious
field of action at the time of the Crusades, but
sometimes strangely fails to appreciate the
higher moral alms of modern civilization.
There are two Roosevelts in the- field â the
Ideal and the legendary Roosevelt, as he once
appeared, and as many people Imagine him
still to be; and the real Roosevelt, as he has
since developed!
It has become the advocate and servant of
a combination of pecuniary Interests, la main
taining a high protective tariff going far
beyond its orofessed objects, despoiling the
many for the benefit ol a few, and striving
to keerÂ» Itself In power by a system of cor
ruption organized on a national scale. It has
by a policy of adventure, conquest and arbi
trary rule over subject nations set aside *t ho
fundamental principles upon which this repub
lic was founded, and thus dangerously weak
ened In our democracy the highest conserva
tive influence â the popular adherence to our
traditional doctrines and Ideals. It has robbed
the American people of the inestimable priv
ilege of being exempt from, the burden of
enormous armaments under which other na
tions are groaning, by imposing, without the
slightest necessity, 'similar burdens on our
banks. It has thereby not only ceased to
countenance and Inspire the efforts made in
favor of direction of general disarmament,
but disQu!Â«tlng other cowers by our building
a great war fleet quite superfluous except for
aggre&slve purposes; It is Inciting them to fol
low suit, thus speeding the ruinous raoe and
ranging the American republic among the In
stigators of a retrogressive tendency hostile- to
true civilization.
BOLTON LANDING, Oct.\ 2.â Carl
Schurz, in a letter to the general sec
retary of the Parker Independent clubs,
made public to-day, writes at length on
the issues of the campaign. "There
never was," he says, "a political party
in a Democracy, however virtuous It
may have been at the start, that was
not by long possession of power more
or less corrupted and made arrogant
and arbitrary." The Government of
this republic, he said, must be a Gov
ernment not permanently controlled
by one political party, but by different
parties alternating in the possession
of power. Criticizing the Republican
party, Schurz says:..

ABUSES OF TIIE TRUSTS.
Our Federal constitution has appropriated to
the ex'-lufclve use of the general Government
the rower of indirect taxation, coverad by the.
popular designation of "tariff duties." In ex
cluding the States from this domain of taxa
tion there is an implied and wise partition of
the taxing power between the Statea and the
Federal Government. Kxcept in the exigencie*
of war the taxing power has been exercised by
Congress largely in the dlttrcUon of the im
po*>ulon of duties upon import*. Xo one ex
pects to change this arrangement, which has
proven so convenient to the general Govern
ment and so conducive to the interests of the
htatec whose resort to other sources of revenue
Is left untrammeled. Indirect taxation, how
ever convenient, needs, by reason of indirect
ness to be watchfully guarded, lest abuses
Fhould attach themselves unknown by the peo
ple. Th*t many of the existing tariff rates
are exoesslve and enable powerful combina
tions to extort unjust and oppressive trib
ute from the people cannot be controverted.
The tariff is indubitably too high on euch ar
ti<->ji as Â«iable the manufacturer to sell his
products abroad cheerier than at home. SteoJ
rails are a conspicuous example In this re
epert. It Is admitted that they are being
made for f!5 a ton. A few years ago they
â¢new freely sold In this country at $17 a ton
Tli-y are now selling at the mil!* here for home
consumption at $28 a ton. and for the foreign
market at from $1S to $22 a ton. This unjust
discrimination againrt our people is made pos
*ibie only by a tariff that on this article is
entirely too hi*h.
WOULD MODIFY THE TARIFF.
These and many other unwarranted things,
that bclonr more to an empire than to a re
public, have occurred unÂ£er the administration
and brought deep concern and alarm to
thoughtful and patriotic minds. They must
be regarded as the first fruits of imperialism
and show how fast we are drifting toward
absolutism and centralized power. The effect
of the imperialistic policy of the Republican
party on our foreign affairs is in oppoeitlon
to the teachings of the founder* of the re
public, and so imposed was Washington with
thÂ» importance of keeping aloof from the af
fairs of other nations that in his farewell ad
dreys he warned his countrymen especially
agair.st foreign entanglements.
Imi*rialls,m Is hurtful and abhorrent In a
free government and subversive of free in
stitutions. The policy of imperialismâ If it
can be raid to have a policy â is always <lan
perous to liberty. Its powers are first exer
cised in far-off territory and on conquered
Peoples, but once adopted for acquired and
dUtar.t posfv-fcEionp it becomes, soonor or
later, the rule of the home government. Lib
erty and free government have always been

history teaches us that both can be easily loit

dent has paid that the number of soldiers now
Is r.o greater per capita than in former times.
Eut an army then was necesi-ary to protect
settlers from the Indians and to do other police
duty in the unsettled portions of the country â
conditions which do not now exist. The army,
however, has greatly increased in cost, much
last^r relatively than it has> In numbers. The
f xpenditures were: l.'nder Buchanan, in 1860,
$1<" r.U'.'XiO; under Hayes, in 1XKO. $3S,CO0,00u;
ur.der Roosevelt, in 1904. $115,000,000.
We a'.l hail as the harbinger of the new
tra in the commerce of the world the incep
tion of the great work of building the canal
that is to join the two great oceans, but we
dtprecate the action of the present adminin
tration which Inflicted a wound upon our na
tional honcr by Us disregard of the rights of
a wtaker nation in order to gain a doubtful
credit for energy in forwarding that great
enterprise. The territory of a neighboring re
public, with which ive are at peace. waÂ« seized
by a baud of revolutionists, protected by the
nun? of the United States navy, and erected
into a state over night, which the President
jTomptly recognized be an independent na
tionâa gross offense against a friendly re
public, which it was helplese to resent.
INCREASE IX COST OF ARMY.
The expenditure* per capita, of the Govern
ment are inctx-asicc at an alarming rate.
VThen the present administration went into
power there was a large surplus, but. notwith
standing the enormous taxation, the revenues
therefrom are not now adequate to meet the
demands made by recklew appropriations. The
revenues fell short during the last fiscal year
over $40,000,000. During the first sixty days of
this fiscal year the expenditures exceeded the
receipts by $24,000,000, and If this rate of ex
cess should continua the deficit for the present
fiscal year would be in the neighborhood of
$140,000,000. Tills needless deficit is due to the
extravagance of the administration and can
only be met by Imposing additional taxes or
â¢>el!ing bonds, thereby increasing the interest
bearing debt of the Government. Which course
will the Republicans adopt? The cost of gov
ernment during the fiscal year was $7 14 per
capita, which means that the average tax paid
!n some form or another by every family of
five persons toward the support of the national
adnr.nistratton of public affairs was over $25,
which, in the rase of wage earners, is a con
siderable percentage of the entire earnings for
the year. No more money should be taken
from the people by taxation, direct or indirect.

Dear Sirs: In accordance with custom, and
my premise when notined by your committee
at White Puijrhur Springs, on August 17, of my
nomination tor the office of Vice President, I
EU'amu the following observations upon some
of the questions before the country:
The times are propitious for the reinstate
ment of the Democratic party in control of the
Government. The public mind Is being disil
lusioned ot the i>rÂ«'l<?nÂ»ion of the Republican
party, so leng and to arrogantly male, that
;ne material prcyperity of the country depends
vij>on its own ascendency. Thoughtful and pa
triotic people are becoming more and more dis
trustful Â«f the heady and personal elements of
the present administration and are more than
VtniBS to see it replaced by one that better
rÂ«cogr.:res countltutional and other lawful re
ptralnts. They demand that the present waste
ful fiLtravagance in the expenditure of th*
money, drawn by taxation from the industry
of the 5*-cpl<\ Fhall cease, and that economy
and honesty in the public service shall be again
regarded as virtue* In the high places of the
Government.
ELKLNS, W. Va.. Oct. 2. â H. G.
Davis" letter to John Sharp Williams,
in which he accepts the nomination of
Vice President on the Democratic
ticket, was made public to-day. It
is as follcnvs:
ELKINS. W. Va.. Oct. 3. 1901.â Hon. John
Sharp Wii'iami-. Chairman, and Other Mem
bens of the Committee â
Peculation and fraud In the public service
under the present administration, especially
tn the Postofnce and Land departments,
reached 6uch proportions that knowledge of
the evils practiced became public property.
Prosecutions naturally followed, but a thorough
and impartial Investigation by Congress, pro
posed and urged by the Democratic minority,
was refused by the Republicans at the man
date. It is believed, of the administration, Con
erees adjourned earlier than at any long ses
sion for many years, for the purpose. It is be
lieved, of preventing further agitation of the
question and in an effort to curtail expenses.
Offices are created and filled in pursuance of
law to carry on the Government and not to fur
ther party ambitions and the self-purpose of
any citizen. Many of the hundred thousand
Federal officeholders, servants of all the people
while under salary, are now vigorously some
covertly and openly, working and contributing
in thÂ« present campaign to secure the success
of the Republican party in defiant violation
of the civil service laws, rules and regula
tions. Heveral members of the Cabinet and
other offlciais of the Government, forsaking
their duties and the departments at Wash
ington, are spending their time in making
speeches and using all the influence and power
of their official positions to elect their chief.
The late Democratic convention and its can
didate for President have given signal exhi
bition of a mutual respect and confidence al
most unprecedented in our political history,
and our party has received new inspiration
and hope in its appeal to the people, who
always appreciate and admire courage char
acter and discretion in their leaders. Our can
didate has these qualities, and can be de
pended upon at all times to observe that self
control In speech and action which is so neces
sary to safe reasoning and sound Judgment.
With unabated trust in the efficiency of the
cardinal principles of our great party, when
applied to the practical administration of Gov
ernment, to realize the blessings of peace and
prosperity for all, and believing that the peo
ple will correct the present abuses of admin
istration by a change of party In power I
await with confidence the result of their Judg
ment at the polls. Very truly yours,
H. G. DAVIS,
FRAUD IX PUBLIC SERVICE.
The declaration in the St. Louis platform In
favor of arbitration Is one that appeals to
any Fense of fairness. Nations and States
have employed to advantage this method of
settling disputed questions. States have invoked
its aid with Kood results, and Individuals fre
quently have resorted to it in adjusting ques
tions of differenoe. The Hague tribunal, repre
senting the sentiment of conciliation, is the
highest practical expression of Intelligent
thought on this subject. The principles of
arbitration are the same, whether governing
in the great court of nations or applied in the
affairs of individual life. Its permanent estab
lishment as * part of the Industrial system
ot the country upon a basis of mutual con
sent of all parties to a controversy would In
sure more friendly relations between employer
and employed, for the interest of the working
man and the employer Is identical. It affords
a safe and equitable method of determining
differences that may arise, ana nas been called
"a reasonable and natural mode" of settling
such disputes. The splgtt of arbitration is
kindred to tiie love of law and order. It Is
the arbiter of peace Instead of war and make*
for happiness instead of sorrow.
All lovers of their country must deprecate
the rehabilitation by the Republican party of
a disappearing race issue at a time when every
effort should be made to promote, rather than
retard, the progress which was being made In
the States where slavery had existed toward
kindlier relations between the two races. The
revival of this Issue with all its attendant evils
must of necessity retard the development of
the Southern States, whose people are strug
gling manfully with conditions left by the war
and seriously interferes with the industrial
progress of both races.
MSXEFITS OF ARBITRATION".
Local self-government that came to us, not
as the cift of the national Government, but
us the legitimate outcome of the reserve
powers of the States and of the people. Is the
very cornerstone' of our political structure and
the best assurance of liberty regulated by law.
It can only be maintained by strict observance
and limitations of the Federal constitution.
The Democratic party has always resisted and
will continue to resist the encroachment by Its
enemies upon the fundamental right of the
people of the several States. All power conies
from the people and should be surrendered only
In th" Interests of the people, and whenever
this power is used for sollish interests it la
not only an iibu.se, but usurpation.
known as trusts," which have grown up In the
last few years, under Republican rule. Pome
of them are zo cuiidurted as to be jxrnicioue
and harmful to the general interest.. \VU!i the
power th*y are able to exert, they can lÂ»?EPn
competition, control prices and rt-KUlate to their
own advantage the law of supply and de
mand. Individual effort 13 helpless against
srjeh strong rivals, and the natural right of
all persons to barter and trade is unnaturally
restricted. The efforts of these trusts is to
control cr monoiiolize and these monopolies,
when unrestrained, seem to produce conditions
which bring about strikes and disorders and
disturb the business affairs of the country.

Our office has received an unusually large

they want. The principal demand Is for home*
ranging in value from $2,100 to $5000.
Our renting department ts also very bufcy at

of suitable houses for rent. There ts absolute

President Forderer said:
Professor Mead devotes some space
to a description of irrigation in New-
Jersey, where experiments are being
made with asparagus, blackberries,
raspberries?, gooseberries, currants and
strawberries.
9 â Tlie main drawbacks are. the lack of
knowledge regarding the practical handling
of wat*>r In the field and too lavish application,
especially If soon followed by rain.
10â During the last seven or eight years
very little advancement has been niaiV in irri
gation farming, but at present farmers are
arrantlnj? their wells with reference, to prob
able future use. and when the necessity again
arises rrmny will be prepared ahd will make
use of tiu-lr supply. In general, those -who
have not waited for the necessity to arise, but
have practiced irrigation as a part of improved
and intensified farming-, have found It proflt
abte. own under the present favorable natural
conditions
7 â Tlie crops are always of superior quality,
grading No. 1 when unirrigated crops grade
No. 3, or are even rejected. Â¦>
fi â A food two-Inch well supplemented by a
reservoir will furnish water for half a sec
tion of land.
? â The talts In the water and thoÂ«e drawn
from the land have not thus far had any
detrimental effect, nor do they plve Indication*
that they will have In the future. All cases
of deterioration of the soil are directly trace
able to an over supply of water.
5 â L'nder irrigation the farmer is practically
sure of a rfoi> each year.
Â«â In ordinary or extra dry years the crop
Is increased two. and sometimes three fold.
1 â Irrigation can be practiced to advantage
during: most of the years, though there Is
â¢ccasjonally a year when the moisture is suf
ficient and properly distributed.
2 â The wells are not called upon to furnish
all the water needed for crops, but merely to
supplement rainfall.
Â¦'4â Care must M taken that the ROlt does
not become too wet.
Professor Mead summarizes his con
clusions drawn from the investigations
carried on In the humid sections in
the following manner:
As chief of the irrigation investiga
tion of the United States Department
of Agriculture Professor Elwood Mead,
who is now on his way to California
to take up his duties as professor of
irrigation at the University of Califor
nia, has Just published a report on the
irrigation investigation in the humid
sections of the United States during
1S93 that will be valuable to all men
interested in agricultural pursuits. The
report deals almost exclusively with
the irrigation of market-garden crops
and the deduction he draws is that
such crops cannot be profitably grown
except that farmers irrigate intelli
gently. Irrigation as fln assurance
against drv farming has proved very
profitable to the Eastern farmers who
had the wisdom not to rely on the rain
that they could not ordinarily expect.
He gaid:
Therr is <>v*ry reason to bpllev* that, as
population inrrÂ»* Â»Â«â¢* and land becomes morp
valusbl", the rone In which irrigation can tw
profitably emjiloyed Will be extended In thin
country, as it nan been In Europe. With
lilphr priced croim and more extrnslve cul
tivation. Irrigation will Inevitably take Its pUce
a* an important agency In the agricultural and
horticultural portions of the Eastern hair of
the United States.

It is claimed by the officials of the

cured from Campbell, paralleling the
Southern Paclfit; tracks to Almaden. A
dispute arose with one of the owners,
who, 'It is said, went back on his
agreement. As & result the gang was
sent to lay the tracks before it will
be possible for the owner to procure
a writ of injunction. The newly laid
rflils will be carefully guarded to-day.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 2. â A bold move
was made by the San Jose and Los
Gatos Railway Company last night,
when a gang of 4 00 men was put to
work to lay a mile or track through
a prune and peach orchard located be
tween Campbells and Almaden. The
train bearing the men left San Fran
cisco early last night. Besides the
workmen there was also a plentiful
supply of ties, rails and other material
necessary for the laying of a track.
At about 11 o'clock active operations
were begun and it is expected that by
morning the track will be laid. A
gang of men with axes first started In
and in a few moments had cut a wide
swath through the orchard. Prune
and peach trees fell right and left and
were hurled aside like so much brush.
The party was well organized and one
gang of men followed .closely on the
heels of another, rapidly completing
the work of destruction arid construc
tion.

ADAMS. Mass.. Oct. 2. â While Right
Rev. Thomas D. Beauen, Roman Cath
olic Bishop of Springfield, was laying
the cornerstone of St. Stanislaus Polish
Church here this afternoon a floor col
lapsed, precipitating 150 persons into
the basement. A dozen persons were
Injured. several seriously. Bishop
Beauen and several priests assisting
him were slightly hurt.
The siost seriously Injured: Grodek
Mischleski, aged 16 years, critical; Miss
Belle Turner, legs fractured; Rev. L. O.
Triggane, injured on head and face;
Rev. I. T. Rodier, contusions; Rev. M.
F. Kopytkiewcz, legs Injured, contu
sions on forehead; Mrs. Michael Mc-
Andres, leg fractured; Right Rev.
Tbomas D. Beauen, bruised slightly

stock. Injured about head. Several oth
ers were also slightly hurt.
Some 7000 persons attended the cere
mony and about 200 were seated or
standing on the floor, which covered
the newly made basement. Just as the
Bishop was a.bout to lay the stone a
eection of the flooring about forty feet
square collapsed, dropping twelve feet
and carrying with it the Bishop, the
clergy and about 140 others. In the con
fusion that followed .many were tram
pled upon and half-suffocated.
Bishop Beauen was caught in the
crush, but was able to save himself
from serious injury. He was bruised
about the body and had his hands
scratched.
These are among the conditions which we
are called upon to face â not to wring our

Money may talk, but most people

In no surroundings which I have ever known;
in no city which I have ever s*en in any of the
world's continents, have life's activities seemed
to whirl and buzz so restlessly aa here. The
output of human energy is at the full. The
man who comes hither irom quieter, older, per
haps sleepier, regions, is apt to be a little be
wildered, a little dazed, even, while he won
ders and admires. And then this thought comes.
How easily in all the tossing of these rapids
m.ust the weaker tsort of folk be submerged
and go out of sight and out of thought. Â¦
We know bo much about all that is going on
that we come to care less. Nothing happens
anywhere but some hurried account must, in
an hour or two, be sped throughout the workl.
The account may be inaccurate â half fact, half

But bores in the P. C. W. Press Asso

any, they seem to have dropped out.
Tea brewed after the Forum formula
stimulated a busy chatterâ your par
don, ladiesâ for a pleasant hour. On
Wednesday next Mrs. Charles Goodall
will see that the ladies hear all about
the expositionâ and undoubtedly the se
ductive, alluring Pike.
This closed the solo work and Mme.
Seminario conluded the programme
with the "Stabat Mater," assisted by a
chorus of mixed voices. The Forum
Club, which holds high rank for Intel
lectual activities, is as well a patron of
the artistry of life.

The course comprises ten lectures,
and at a cost of $2 50, beginning
Wednesday morning at 10:30 o'clock.
They will embrace live topics, with
which every intelligent member of
society should be on speaking terms.
In the language of the announcement,
they will embrace American and for
eign political changes, economic ques
tions and social matters of moment,
the proceedings of Congress, reports
on Inventions and the discoveries of
science, reviews of notable books, run
ning comments of a literary character
and short selected readings, poems,
etc. A partial digest of some of these
affairs would give us something else
to talk about besides dress, diseases
and domestics.
Wednesday at 10:30 a. m. â First
Unitarian parlors. The Forum Club,
Mrs. Frank Fredericks, president, host
âor is the hostess? â at a musicale
given by the Howe Club, last Wednes
day afternoon. James Hamilton Howe,
one of the pioneer musicians of this
Western burg, both in technical
knowledge ,and experience, directed
the programme which proved to be a
source of joy.
Mme. Tdade Seminario sang Meyer
beer's "Prayer" and barcarolle from
"Star of the North"â dramatically clas
sic, and well suited to Mme. Semina
rio's compass and quality. The follow
ing compositions were all Howe lyrics,
and were interpreted by the following
singers:
Those Charming Auxiliary- lectures
at the First Unitarian Church par
lors by Mrs. Louise Benson promise
much to the appreciated folk who will
hear them â a privilege that every
able-bodied and able-minded woman
of leisure should accept â and forth
with.
And, says Dr. Moore's booklet, "the
work stands in need of an enlightened
public opinion."
Men and women of San Francisco,
are you willing to give this splendid
work your moral support? Men of
San Francisco, are you willing to sup
port measures at the polls for the
furtherance of this civic and Christian
duty?
At a decade's end. the seeds sown in
the California Club three years ago
will bear golden fruit, and our city
will be cleaner, happier and infinitely
safer for you and me.
It needs stronger laws concerning
child labor, and the enforcement of
those now lying inert on the statute
books.
Among the list of crimes charged to
these children axe grand larceny, petty
larceny, battery, malicious mischief,
vagrancy, manslaughter, drunkenness,
violation of 8 o'clock ordinance, build
ing â¢ fires In public places, burglary,
shooting craps, robbery, playing ball In
streets, truancy and obstructing street
cars.
Of these 1282 cases tried by Judge
Muraskyâ and blessings on him for his
humane care! â 843 were discharged, 41
returned to parents, 274 committed to
institutions and 122 placed on probation
â the latter reporting to the Judge at
regular intervals and to the probation
officers. Miss Londa L. Stebbins and
William H. Hutton.
Now, this court for the salvation of
children needs the strict enforcement
of the compulsory education law, with
its parental school and its detention
home as auxiliaries.
Should the California Club be sud
denly haled before St. Peter for an ac
counting of its deedsâ and dare I say
Its misdeeds?â the part it has played in
behalf of children would draw from the
astute guardian of the keys a benison.
For it was In the California Club that
the seeds of the Juvenile court were
first sown, and that institution is prov
ing more effective In the saving of
erring or mismanaged children than all
the churches and Sabbath-schools in
the city. And this is no idle assertion,
but borne out by facts, many of which
are given publicity in a booklet com
piled by Dr. Dorothea Moore, chairman
of the California Club section of the
Juvenile court commission.
Between May 8, 1903, and June 17,
1904, 12S2 boy and girl offenders have
been under arrest. Under the old con
ditions these erring children would have
been huddled into cells with adult of
fenders marked by physical and moral
filth. Under the new law they were
placed apart and were visited by the
probation officers, who looked into the
conditions that led to their troubles.
And it's not uninteresting to learn that
stepmothers stand at the head of the
list of causes, with stepfathers a close
second. When the father is deadâphy
sically or morallyâ and the mother the
wage-earner, is another prolific cause,
with drunkenness circling somewhere
about most cases.
BY LAURA BRIDE POWERS.
The ball of festivity, set in motion
during the last fortnight, \ is steadily
gaining in speed. Urged here and. there
by the impatient, soon the momentum
will be such as to brook no interference
until the Lenten days shoot forth their
shadows â not of sadness, but of serious
ness. Till then the prospect pleases. A
few wanderers are lingering, but more
are home-coming, while the marriages
promised are so numerous that we shall
be regaled with a veritable set of wed
ding chimes between now and holiday
time. So the schedule speaks, and in
the meantime there are raiments of
glorious' and varied hue 1 ready to burst
forth when cause demands.

Now that the winter season has
opened there*, is much activity at the
Jefferson Square Club, and several high
alley scores have been made by both
men and women. Mrs. May Lee sur
prised the members the other day by
making a score of 243. and Fred Kro
nenberg showed his skill by making a
record of 279. A series of handsome
prjzas have been placed on exhibition
to oe offered during the month of Octo
ber for the highest scores and the best
average scores made in thirty frames.
The fact of these prizes being offered
has already created considerable inter
est among the members, and they are
now practicing with a vim in order to
get In trim for competing for these tro
phies. ' Bowling in the East has for
some time past proven itself to be the
most popular of sports, and it- Is being
taken up with avidity, in San Francis
co. The management of the club has
added four additional bowling alleys,
making twelve in alL' A' number of pri
vate clubs have v been formed, and the
management will during the coming
season have six alleys which can be re
served for orivate clubs. This will be
very agreeable to a great many, , who
last season, could not reserve alleys on
account of the limited number.
A mighty interesting convention will
be that of the suffragists on the 6th and
7th in the southland. And who knows
what may be the outgrowth of this ag
gregation of intelligent women seeking
their rights? With President Roosevelt
as a strong ally their cause looks bright
âanother Rooseveltian sin, say his an
tagonists, but the wome:i of the na
tion acclaim it his highest virtue. The
Susan B. Anthony Club at its last
meeting elected the following delegates
to the convention: Mrs. Nellie Hol
brook-Blinn. Mrs. Clara Foltz. Mrs. E.
J. Northon, Mrs. N. Fletcher, Mrs. Aus
tin Sperry, Mrs. G. W. Pringle, Mrs.

The Forty-first- District Political

ident, held a vigorous meeting on
Thursday afternoon at Dr. Kibbe's
residence.
Delegates to the California Equal
Suffrage Convention, to be held at Los
Angeles on the 6th and 7th, were bal
loted for and Mrs. Lillian Coffin, Mrs.
Margaret Wheelan and Mrs. Claire O.
Southard were fleeted. During the
meeting a letter was read from Mrs.
Bidwell of Chico. asking that the ladies
interest themselves in the matter of
shade protection along country roads,
directing attention to the fact that
beautiful trees are ruthlessly sacrificed
in the building of new roads. These,
if left undisturbed, would yield shel

Capital idea!
The Papyrus Club, Mrs. S. Mason
Kinne president, begins its club year
with its usual ebullition of good fel
lowship â of which there is a woeful
dearth among women â taken collect
ively.
The club held its first social meet
ing of the year on September 22 at its
clubrooms, Utopia Hall. It is the in
tention to use no talent this year that
is not supplied" by club members, ex
cepting possibly some charming gentle
men who may be good enough to give
their services. The entertainment com
mittee has been enlarged and divided
into three sections, musical (chairman
Miss Ella V. McCloskey), operatic
(chairman Mme. Caro Roma) and dra
matic (chairman Jenne Morrow-Long).
There has also been a committee ap
pointed on humor and humorists, Mrs.
Kathryn Boyns chairman. The pro
gramme was under the charge of Mrs.
W. W. Briggs and consisted of the fol
lowing: Two violin selections by Miss
Anna Hadsell, contralto solo by Mrs.
Blanche King Arnold, a bass solo by
Carl Bundschu, two soprano solos by
Mrs. W. W. Briggs, Miss Helen Earl
Millberry, the Papyrus Club accom
panist, at the piano, and a most de
lightful rendition of "Aux Italians" by
Jenne Morrow-Long. The members re
turned from their vacation with many
new and bright stories, which were ex
ceedingly enjoyed. The club entertained
as its guest Mrs. E. L. Pilsbury, wife
of E. L. Pilsbury of Massachusetts,
grand guardian of the Sovereign Grand
Lodge of the I. O. O. F. Mrs. Pilsbury
is a member of a Boston club and is a
musician of high standing, having sung
for a number of years with Madame
Emma Eames in a church choir. A
delightful afternoon was spent after
the programme in chatting with the
guest of the day â and with each other
â while partaking of light refresh
ments. The lack of formality and the
prevailing "bonhomie" in the club is
its distinctive fpature.
At the meeting of the Outdoor Art
League on Thursday last it wes decided
to give an entertainment on October
17, the proceeds to be devoted to the
work of the league in furthering sev
eral important municipal improvements
and other projects of city and State
interest. One of the chief objects in
view is a renewal of the attempt to
improve Telegraph Hill by the issuance
of municipal bonds. The contest for
the preservation of tne Calaveras big
trees will also be renewed as soon as
Congress convenes, and for these pur
poses there will necessarily be some ex
pense. The Majestic Theater has agreed
to give the league a liberal percentage
of the receipts on the date selected. The
play will be "The American Citizen."
Educational leaflets on window garden
ing will also be printed for general dis
distribution.
speak on irrigation at the Contem
porary's meeting next meeting.
Inasmuch as fullv a dozen members,
stanSh and true, were present at last
Wednesday's meeting, wouldn't it be
well for the members "to hustle a lit
tle" and present a worthy .showing,
when a busy man like Professor Mead
takes time to talk to them? And it
won't be a dry talk.
The Laurel Hall Club has been hug
ging itself since its last meeting â and
Fmall wonderâ for on that day was it
treated to a feast histrionic.
The programme announced various
readings by Mrs. Newton J. Tharo and
some illustrative dances bv Miss
Jean Logan.
If there was a vagrant thought in
the clubroom during /Mrs. Tharp's
readings, no face betrayed it. Simple,
coy and winsome in "Jennie" she was
strong, convincing and appealing in
the court scene of Richard VIIIâ a
part, by the way, prepared for the tal
ented little woman by Professor Walter
Bradley Tripp of Boston.
Then, Jean Logan, exponent of
artistry in posing and dancing, gowned
first as Gretchen and then as a Greek
maiden, presented some exquisite
dances, and with recitative accompani
ments.
And thus over the teacups was there
much of beauty to. discuss.

many of the laws translated from the

as to safeguard the purity of the ar

CRAZE FOR CRYSTALS
WORD comes from Berlin that the presence of Uncle Sam's
great Mediterranean fleet in German waters has had a dis
turbing effect upon naval tacticians of William's empire.
iThe German Navy League's next issue will declare that with the
present fleet and the ships a-building the United States could blow
the imperial navy out of the water without any great effort, and the
publication will attribute this superiority to the preponderance of
high-power guns on our warships.
After the constant experimental investigation of years our
naval constructors have hit upon the long range gun as the chief
offensive arm of the modern battleship's equipment. In the Con
necticut, just launched, and which represents the type for the con
structiQn of all vessels of her class ordered by Congress, the main
battery consists of four 12-inch guns of the latest type and eight
8-inch guns; the secondary battery comprises a full complement of
rapid-firing guns, both of heavy and light type. With the great
guns of this Connecticut type shells can be thrown as far and with
greater accuracy than those projected by the old 13-inch rifles of
the Oregon and Massachusetts, and their effectiveness is equal. " The
Connecticut's main battery represents a terrible potency in actual
combat.
Naval observers of every land recognize one clear fact that
stands forth from the bloody nebula of the sea fights in the present
war, and that is that the long distance gun is the decisive "factor
in modern naval warfare. In the last sortie of the Russian fleet from
Port Arthur, as well as in the engagement between Admiral Kami
mura and the Vladivostok fleet, fighting was engaged in when the
opposing ships were almost Hull-down to each other's vision. Miles
and not yards was the measurement of distances between the con
testants. In both instances the more effective armament of- the
Japanese fleets in the matter of high-power guns threw the weight
of great superiority on their side of the balance.

r T^HROUGH a pamphlet designed as a part of the Denver ex-
I hibit of juvenile court work at the World's Fair and aptly
A entitled "The Problem of the Children," those interested in
the question of the treatment of delinquent and incorrigible chil
dren at the hands of the law will find a report the most cheering.
In this resume of the fourth year of the juvenile court's jurisdic
tion in Colorado's capital city, written largely out of the personal
experience of the presiding magistrate, the Hon. Ben B. Lindsey,
will be found detailed account of the progress made by those de
voted to the regeneration of wayward children under Colorado's
well-advised laws.
Judge Lindsey gives the spirit of the juvenile court's aim in
a nutshell, when he says that its efforts are not so much toward
reforming as to forming of childish character. It is for the young
incorrigible and not against him that all efforts are directed and
this fact is early impressed upon his understanding. The Judge
himself doffs the stern majesty of the law in dealing with juvenile
cases and brings himself down to the social level of "Boyville" by
entering into the story of each offender's special wrongdoing with
every show of personal interest and by giving advice rather than
grave admonition. To combat the negative influence of so many
homes â too often the real cause for youthful delinquency â the
Denver Juvenile Court has as adjunct special libraries and baths for
all boys who care to take advantage of them; an allied private
society obtains summer labor in the country for the probationaries ;
offenders under arrest cannot be taken to a jail, but are temporarily
lodged in a home-like detention house, provided by law.
Colorado has taken a long step in the right direction by plac
ing responsibility for the delinquency in the child upon the parents
and the home. By statute it has been enacted that parents and
guardians against whom neglect or immoral influence displayed
toward children can be proven are themselves amenable to the
law's punishments. Had we such a law in California our own ex
cellent juvenile court would find its labors lightened.

MY LADY'S 'KERCHIEF
THE last quarter of the year, upon which we have now entered,
bids fair to be the best of tho year, which, according to the esti
mates of financiers ami posted business men, will probably end
better than it began. As already mentioned, there has been a gradual
expansion in trade during the' past month or two, which has ex
tended all over the country. This is due to the decreased production
of many commodities, which has allowed the demand to again
overtake the supply, the settlement of several important labor dis
turbances, good crop prospects, continued abundance of money, a
gratifying absence of the usual apprehensions preceding a Presi
dential election, a belief that there will be no deleterious changes
in financial and tariff conditions for a year at least, and an increasing
demand for all sorts of merchandise throughout the country. These
encouraging conditions are reflected in a larger volume of bank
clearings, improved collections in many parts of the country, a visible
expansion in the jobbing and retail trades, increasing railway earn
ings, an upward tendency in railway and industrial stocks in New
York, 1 and in numerous minor ways, which cannot be fully enume
rated here. But the improvement is with us and is perceptible to
everybody conversant with the trade situation.
The great staples are especially exhibiting marked improve
ment. There is a heavy demand for wheat all over the country to
satisfy a largely increased demand for flour. The millers are buying
wheat everywhere. They have even entered the two Northern
Pacific States as heavy buyers, have already purchasd 10,000,000 or
12,000,000 bushels and would now be taking a great deal more were
they not compelled to pause by the inability of the overland rail
roads to haul the grain East as fast as it is bought. This demand
has caused advances in wheat and flour all over the country, though
wheat has shown some recessions from the high prices at Chicago
during the past several days. These are golden times for the wheat
farmers. Provisions are also showing more firmness. The corn
and cotton crops are still a matter of some uncertainty, but large
crops of both seem reasonably assured. Wool continues firm and
active at all important centers. The buying of hops has been un
precedented, and though the 1904 yield is not yet fully prepared for
market, all but a small fraction of it has already passed out^ of
growers' hands and, what is especially gratifying, at extremely high
prices. More activity in pig iron is reported, and those conversant
with the trade are predicting better times in this industry. Large
purchases of hides in Western markets have strengthened prices
there. So it will be seen that the country's great staples are in most
excellent condition, and this alone almost assures another year of
prosperity.
Thus far the movement of the crops, now commencing, has
produced no appreciable effect on the money market. Rates are
naturally a little firmer, but no advance of any consequence has oc
curred and no future stringency is expected.
Our local situation remains about as before. A week ago it was
feared that widespread damage had been caused by the severe Sep
tember rains, and, indeed, the dry feed has been seriously damaged.
But fortunately the storm was followed by a hot, drying north wind,
which did much to modify the effects of the storm. Grapes, hay,
beans, tomatoes and some grain on river banks have been injured,
but the ground has received such a thorough wetting that unusually
earl}* plowing" can be begun, so that the rain was not such an un
mixed evil after all. What we want now is showers enough to keep
the new feed growing until the regular winter rains set in, and if
we get them we may consider ourselves fairly embarked upon an
other year of agricultural and commercial prosperity.
TRADE STILL IMPROVING.
The filmy, delicate millinery crea
tions of summer must now give -way to
something a little more substantial.
Hats made of straw braids, and also
those of tulle and lace, are seasonable
as to the shapes. Among the au
tumn rogues are many ' variations of
the trlcorne and the turban with pro
jecting front. But there are also any
number of small-brim hats tilted for
ward and turried up sharply at the
back. >'. '
The IMrectolre hat, with its sweep
ing bird of paradise feather, has re
turned to favor, and certainly there la
no more appropriate accompaniment
to the fashionable gown of the pe
riod than this picturesque model.
Fruit trimmings will adorn the lat*
summer hat. and among these there
is none more effective than berries,
which are frequently seen in many
shades of light blue, mauve and green
clustered together upon one hat.
Gooseberries are in high favor, and
Immense bunches of grapes depend
from the back of some of the most
attractive hats. Flowers, too, will
trim the between season hat. Espe
cially smart are the roses and other
blossoms that shade from the deep
brown through tans, orange and yel
low.
These axe used on brown, green
and burnt straw, as well as tulle hats
In the same colors. Ostrich, plumes
In white, black and green and in
shaded effects are a popular though
expensive trimming for the dressy hat.
while for the severe or tailored head
gear there are quilts, wings and cock
ades to be used In association with
ribbon or velvet.

Alamedans have never been spiritless. They
have had plenty of spirit, of a certain kind â
a good kind. It has been of a kind to make

tions have again assumed a serious
phase at Zeigler. and what seemed to
be a complete victory for Joseph Leiter
has turned almost into defeat. Emissa
ries of the Miners' Union have succeed
ed in inducing a large number of Leit
er's men to strike, and Saturday forty
five of them went out by way of Chris
toj5her.
The exodus continued yesterday, and
it Is claimed that In twenty-four hours
not more than sixty miners will be left.
The cause of the present conditions, as
claimed by the men who have left, is
that sufficient wages cannot be earned
and also that too high prices are
charged for board and clothing.

The greatest interest will attend the
statements that the Nevada County
Promotion Committee makes in refer
ence to and in support of its claim
that Nevada County is the leading
gold mining 'county in the State of
California. It is nroudly said that
"since 1849 it has stood first in the
production of gold and for a contin
uous period of more than fifty-four
years its mines have been in opera
tion and are to-day producing their
millions of dollars annually, with un
explored territory to warrant their
operation for the next century."
Some large figures of production by
individual mines are instanced to il
lustrate the county's claim to the ban
ner. The . total output of the Empire
mine at Grass Valley, the oldest quartz
mine in California, is given as more
than $11,000,000. The North Star mines
of Grass Valley are credited with a
total production to date of $20,000,000,
of which, according to an official state
ment by the directors of the company,
$736,087 was produced in gold bullion
in the year 1903. The Maryland-Idaho
group in the same lo;a:ity h^3 a rec
ord of $20,000,000. In the Nevada City
group the Champion mines are reported
to have had an output of more than
$15,000,000. Many other mines in the
district have yielded more than $1,000,
000 each.
In the county are the Bloomfield,
Eureka, Washington and Meadow Lake
districts. "All through the different
parts of ihe county," says the County
Promotion Committee, "the continuous
roar of hundreds of stamps, crushing
countless tons of ore, is heard year in
and year out. Many newer properties,
developed and equipped within the last
few years, are rapidly proving their
worth and sustaining the reputation
of the county."
The largest hydraulic mine in the
world is in Nevada County. This is
the Malakoff. One brick produced from
a Nevada . County hydraulic mine, the
result of one month of running, was
worth $114,000. The hydraulic mines
and the drift mines show that many
miles of ancient river channels exist
in the county, underlying lava capped
ridges, awaiting development by the
drift process to yield up their treas
ures. The product of the Nevada Coun
ty mines is in Itself legal tender. It
is a commodity that has no competitor
and requires, as the committee truth
fully says, no drummer to sell It, In
addition to Its resources in gold . the
county has a copper belt that passes
Taking another view, the Nevada
County Promotion Committee truth
fully says that "this county, In addi
tion to being a producer of gold and
other metals, is also a land of pleasant
homes, with a genial" and diversified
climate, good soil that produces fruit
and all kinds of crops in abundance,

business at home."
THE BANNER COUNTY.
The Nevada County Promotion Com
mittee has issued a descriptive work
in which the fact is made duly prom
inent that Nevada is the banner gold
county of California. In support of
this claim several allegations of more
than common interest are made. As a
preamble, it Is asserted, on the
title page, that Nevada is the
the most prosperous mining coun
ty in the United States and that
its good mines are found where there
is a perfect climate and all the com
forts of civilization, two facts that
cannot fail to attract the attention of
miners in all parts of the world .in
whose knowledge mining ordinarily
means more than common hardships
and many privations.
"The history of Nevada County,"
says the Nevada County Promotion
Committee, "began in the year 18ft,
when thousands of gold seekers who
came to California thronged its rivers,
ravines, canyons and river banks and
enriched themselves to a far greater
extent than any of the recent explorers
of the Klondike. Since that period
it has held its own and is annually
producing millions of dollars and has
added more than $200,000,000 to the
wealth of th3 world."
The committee does not fail to call
attention to the great water supply
in Nevada County. The eastern part
of the county Is crossed by the Sierra
Nevada Mountains, with peaks from
8000 to 9000 feet in height. The annual
snowfall in the mountains is from ten
to twenty feet. From the snow clad
mountains flow the Bear, South Yuba
and Middle Yuba rivers, traversing and
bounding the county. The average
rainfall in the county is from 45 Inches
in the lower lands to 75 inches on the
higher elevations. Years ago, princi
pally for hydraulic mining purposes,
large and expensive!; systems of canals
were constructed, which have since
been greatly extended and have been
made to cover all sections and supply
water for power, mining and irriga
tion.
During the dry season the water sup
ply is kept up by the use of large res
ervoirs that have been constructed in
the mountains, having an average ca
pacity, on the western slopes of the
Sierras, of forty billion gallons. The
large and reliable supply of water, be
ing used for power under high pres
sure, has assisted to make mining prof
itable and has been a great factor In
the development of deep mining.
The eastern portion of Nevada Coun
ty is crossed by the Truckee River, the
outlet of Lake Tahoe. The water from
this river supplies power for lumbering,
manufacturing and mining.
The lands of Nevada County are fer
tile. The diversities of its climate are
due principally to the differences In
elevation. The snow capped Sierra
borders its eastern part and the west
ern county line runs well to the Sacra
mento Valley.
Cereals, common to all California,
flourish well on the farming lands. The
foothills and mountaines contain some
of the finest grazing lands in the State.
The finest supply of apples and Bart
lett pears are produced up to an ele
vation of 3500 feet above the sea level.
Grapes, pruns, figs, olives and oranges
grow at lower elevations. One of the
best known creameries in the State is
in the Penn Valley. Settlers of mod
ern means can procure farming lands,
possessing a variety of soil, at $5 to
$20 an acre. Thousands of acres of land
ere used for pasture that need only
to be cleared of brush to become the
equal of any producing lands in Cali
fornia. Water can be had for irriga
tion at a reasonable price. There are
thousands of acres of timber land that
arc to be bought at from $20 to $50
an acre.
The county has large lumbering in
terests and there are other industries
of importance. The county is well
equipped with schools and churches.
through its western portion, in the
Fpenceville and French Coral districts.
GREAT WATER SUPPLY.
And so Alamedans are waking with the new
thought. If their city were located south of
Tehachapl it would to-day be the most beau
tiful spot In California. It would be the show
place> of show places, and its charms would
have been advertised far and wide. Alamedans
are Just waking up to all this. They have
organized two Improvement clubsâ the Alameda
Advancement Association and the West End
Alameda Improvement Club. These bodies are
In the midst of a campaign of education. They
are rapidly Inoculating- the residents of Ala
meda with enthusiasm.
Not that they are neglecting the lines of
city Improvement which have so long been
followed. No; they are working on thos-5 lines
just the same. In addition thereto,' they are
advertising their advantages to the outside
world. They am Issuing literature. A folder
just published by the Alarneda Advancement
Association contains a fine map of the city,
drawn to a scale, showing the location of the
City Hall, the Public Urjsry. the seven school
houses and the fourteen churches, all the city
streets and the water ;<41es surrounding the
Island It also contain an epitomized de
scription of the city. Us <itlmate, healthfulness,
ease of access, school, thurch and other ad
vantages.
The president of this organization Is George
"W. Scott of Scott & Van Arsdale; 4he vice
president is PhilllD S. Teller of Norton, Teller
A Roden; the others of the board of directors
are B. R- Anthony. Charles B. Neal, George H.
Mastlck, F. W. d'Evelyn. M. D.. and Elmer
a JohMon; Bralnard C. Brown la secretary.
ALAMEDANS ORGANIZE.
For instance, a beautiful strip of land bor
dering the edge of the tidal canaj and belong
ing to the city could be beautified, or a drive
way could be made around the shore of the
whole inland, or the sandy beach on the south
side could be Improved until It afforded a
bathing place of charming attractiveness, or
little Darks could be laid out here and there,
or a spacious auditorium could be erected to
accommodate public gatherings, or a children's
playground with gymnasium facilities could
be provided. In short, thÂ« tight little isle,
already beautiful, could be transformed Into
a gem of delight.
But a change has come over him. He sees
that there are advantages which can be gained,
only by broader co-operation. He sÂ«es that?
with the vacant lots built upon and occupied
by first-class families there will be more tax
money available. Not that his taxes have
ever been burdensome, but there are many
desirable things that a little more money can
do.
Take, for instance, his own home. In years
past be had bought a lot 50 by 150 feet and
had paid, say, $15C0 therefor. He had built
him a house costing, say, $4000. He had spent,
say, *50O in beautifying his grounds. What
benefit would It be to him if property values
should double? To-day that has been his
home for fifteen years. He does not want to
sell. But during those fifteen years he has
seen to it that whatever would make for the
value of his home life and that of his neigh
bors has been attended to.
And so Alameda has drifted along all these
years, happy in its own advantages assured
that for every dollar of taxes spent it re
ceived more than a dollar In return benefits
What did it matter to Alamedans that prop
erty values did not advance? The average
Alamedan had nothing to sell. If speculators
In former years had been foolish enough to
load up with vacant blocks If large tracts
were held intact by estates of deceased per
sons, what cared the Alamedan if the holders
had to hold indefinitely?
During- all these years the average Alamedan
would not turn his hand over to call the atten
tion of outsiders to his own beautiful gem of
a home city. If one by chance had his atten
tion called to what the world at large knew
not of and took up his abode In the favored
suburb, well and good. He was welcomed aa
a man of keen perception, who knew a good
thing when he saw it. Probably he bad origi
nally come to view the place by the solicita
tion of some Alameda friend. If so, he was
made doubly welcome, for that friend stood
sponsor for his acceptability. At any rate, he
was now an Alamedan, and as such wa3 en
titled to all the righu and privileges of fel
lowship.
The average Alamedan has for years been
content In the satisfaction that his little city
was the place of all places In the world for
a pleasant home; the place of all places for
the raising of a family. If the outside world
knew not of t)*e advantages which he enjoyed,
so much the worst for the world. If the lot
next to his own beautiful residence was va
cant, so much the better. He got all the more
sun thereby; his children had all the more
playground thereby.
SPIRIT OP CONTEXT.
low as they could have been under careful
private management. They have had the spirit
to rut a high license on saloons and to deter
mine that no saloon should be opened in resi
dence localities, the number of saloons in the
city aggregating but twenty-three. They have
known o f the mildness of their climate; of the
soft modulation of their ocean breezes; of the
cheap and quick ferry system, with boats
every fifteen minutes, making trips In forty
minutes; of their pure water supply from
deep artesian wells. Â¦ They have recognized
the .value of all these things. Whether other*
recognized that value they have cared not.
The harbor police officers stationed at the
union ferry building have begun a work that
will earn them the gratitude of every traveler
who enters San Francisco by the transbay
route A swarm of transfer agents Infest the
arcades of the great structure and make life
miserable for the stranger who comes into the
city. They gather around him and snatch at
his grip or suit case and if he looks gullible he
will be promised a free ride to any part of
the city, providing the agent gets the transfer
of the baggage. Of course, no eucn promise
is ever kept and the victim is bled for what
ever sum he may be made pay.
Officer John Dower arrested O. E. Miller, a
transfer man Saturday for violating the city
hack ordinance and disturbing the peace.
Miller met Henry Darby, a stranger, at
Third and Townsend streets, and to get the
transfer of the traveler's suit case agreed to
haul him to the union ferry free of charge.
On arrival at the foot of Market street Mil
ler demanded jl for the fare, which Darby
refused to pay. The altercation attracted
Dower, and Miller threatened to whip both
Darby and the officer. Dower promptly ar
rested the warlike transfer man on the charges
mentioned.

CHICAGO, Oct. 2.â Following Judge
Kersten's decision yesterday to permit
the defense in the Iroquois Theater
case to- pursue its motion for a change
of venue to another county, Assistant
Stat's Attorney Barnes has tentatively
decided to abandon for the present the
prosecution of Business Manager
Noonan and Stage Carpenter Cum
mlngs, and. to place Will J. Davis on
trial alone. He will take no definite
steps to this end, however, until he has
conferred with State's Attorney
Deneen and other officials. .
In order to combat the motion for a
change of venue, the State will have
to present many thousands of affida
vits to controvert those submitted by
the defense and the expense attendant
upon such a procedure would be enor
mous, it is said. If the county offi
cials suggest to Barnes that the cost
of the proceeding: should be taken into
consideration, and Deneen does not ob
ject, Noonan and Cummings will be
put in the background and the prose
cution's attention devoted entirely to
Davis.
"If we cannot convict Davis," said
Barnes, "then there will be no use to
try Noonan and Cummings."

Failure, to Convict .Would
Show Futility of Proceed

ACTION IN ABEYANCE
A sample of what a large vessel can
do when she gets off her course and
runs amuck was demonstrated yester
day morning -when the ferry steamer
Encinal from Alameda tried to make
a landing in her slip on this side of
the bay. A fog obscured all objects
in the vicinity and in trying to feel
her way in the boat was caught by
the tide. She drifted south to the next
dock which is. Mission No. 1. The
way the ferry ' steamer mixed it up
with the end of that pier was start
ling. She jammed her sharp prow into
the corner of the wharf and the big
timbers became splinters. Piles were
pushed aside or broken by the impact
and the whole structure that received
the blow was wrecked. The boat con
tinued on and struck the corner of the
wharf shed, smashing the planking of
the partition into : fragments. A small
building near/ by was completely
wrecked and at employe of the wharf
who happened to be within escaped se
rious Injury by Jumping out through
the open door when he saw the steam
er's sharp stem cutting into the struc
ture. Fortunately no person was in
jured, as at that early hour the' wharf
was almost deserted, and the Encinal
backed away and made her landing un
damaged.

The object of these entertainments is
to aid in completing the permanent
fund of the Teachers' Annuity and Re
tirement Association. The teachers are
engaged in a labor of love in behalf of
those of their number whose long years
of service and devotion as teachers have
earned the right to retire honorably
from the service; or who have been
compelled through failing health to lay
aside the activities of teaching.
In the early history of this organiza
tion the annuitants received a larger
sum than it is now possible to pay.
The number of retired teachers main
tained by the annuity fund has grad
ually increased and in consequence of
this fact the fund devoted to their
maintenance has been greatly dimin
ished.
The vaudeville shows to be produced
upon the stage of the Chutes Theater
and in the Chutes Pavilion promise
to bring out children of unusual tal
ent who have volunteered their services
for this worthy cause. On the Rie!to
there will be booths galore, where all
kinds of refreshments can be obtained
at nominal prices. Teachers from dif
ferent schools will serve" all patrons
and look out for the t wants of the
youngsters. Miss S. M. Wilson will
have charge of the refreshment booths.
Miss Alice Stlncen. Mrs. Brogan, Miss
Phillips and Miss Kervan, with assist
ants, will superintend the other booths.
The doll booth of the Denman School,
under the command of Mrs. Love, will
be a feature. Eight hundred beautiful
dolls will be sold cheaply.
Among the features of the pro
gramme are the following: Bothwell
Browne's pupils in "The Princess Fan
Tan"; "The Queen of Beauty," under
the direction of Miss Elizabeth Mcln
tosh; Chinese children, gorgeous' in
colored gowns; the Columbia Park
Boys' Club; pupils of ' Professor
O'Brien's dancing school; a one-legged
dance by Mrs. Saidee Bugbee.
Final arrangements for the benefit to
be griven at the Chutes this week for
the San Francisco Teachers' Annuity
fund are practically completed. Every
thing is in readiness for the opening
to-day. It will be a week of pleasure
for the children. The last rehearsal in
the children's vaudeville show took
place Saturday.

All of the best players from both
sides of the bay are in the tournament
and the spectators will be treated to
some hlgrh-class tennis when the
champions come together. The bij?
surprise yesterday was the defeat of
Will Collier at the hands of George
Janes. Collier has played but little
of late and was hardly at his best.
Clarence Griffin -beat Neil Baker
three sets out of four. The loser did
not do as well as was expected.
George Busch, the ex-champion of
Montana, played an excellent-game in
the first set of his match with Allen.
He tired after this and Allen won as
he . pleased. The first set went to
14-12, with Busch almost constantly
in the lead.
Drummond MacGavln won two sets
from Carl Gardner and stopped when
the score stood 5-4 and 40-30 in his
favor in the third set. If MacGavin is
unable to play next Sunday the match
will go to Gardner by default. If
MacGavin is able to play Gardner will
default to him.
R. N. Whitney, Percy Murdock and
Grant Smith won their matches
handily. Murdock and Whitney will
come together next Sunday. A sum
mary of the tournament follows: - **
Yesterday was an ideal day for
tennis until the foe came in late in
the afternoon. Both ttie park and the
club courts were crowded all day long.
On the public courts play was re
sumed in the first annual tournament
for the Lloyd cud and for the cham
pionship .of the bay counties.
Loser Shows Lack of Practice and
Cannot Stand the Severe
Pace.

G. Lacy Crawford, the young St.

Hooker and Agile Spurt the most
promising of this season's greyhounds.

another young hound, was runner-up.

the view of the spectators during the
afternoon. The dogs could not be seen
after they left the slips, so heavy was
the haze Full Moon beat some cracks
in the champion stake and won the de
ciding course from T. J. Cronin's Fair
Tralee after a snappy course.
Tralee Maid was fortunate in captur
ing the class stake. She was to meet
Galveston in the final. Galveston was
running in strong form and drew a bye
in the fifth round. He was slipped to a
strong hare that gave him a course
lasting more than two minutes. He was
then withdrawn.
The talent were given a big upset
when Fair Tralee defeated Tom King
in the third round, as they laid 3 to 1
against Cronin's dog. Vandal succeeded
in lowering: the colors of Smiler at 3 to

Model Yachts in Drifting Race.
The model yacht races for the Todd
cup, held yesterday on Spreckela Lake.
Golden Gate Park, were little more
than drifting: matches. The wind was
light all day and many of the races
had to be declared off. as the boats did
not finish within the time limit of
six minutes thirty seconds. Three
boats qualified for the finals and one
final race was held. In It the Apache
beat the Santee and Piute. The win
ner's time was 6:16, which is remark
ably slow. The Apache. Santee and
Piute. which are owned respectively
by "William Roeckner, Todd & Adams

NEW YORK. Oct. 2. â Morris Park's
fall meeting of twelve days will begin
to-morrow at the great race course in
Westchester. Racing in Westchester
may never be seen again, at any rate
not under its present management, and
with this as a strong likelihood many
will make it a point to visit the fam
ous course. Considering the fact that
the meeting falls directly upon the
close of that at Gravesend, the fields
to-morrow are satisfactorily large.
The two divisions of the Matron stakes
have good-sized entries to each, while
the other four events are so well filled
that selection of winners will be no
easy task.
No American turfman has made
nominations to the St. Leger of 1906,
which closed three weeks ago. The
total number of nominations was 197.-
This shows a decided falling oft in
number, which Is ascribed to the pol
icy of the management of the Don
caster meeting in adding no money
whatever to the great stake.
The Grand. Prix of Paris, which
closed about the same time and which
is a guaranteed stake of great value,
received 443 entries. These include a
large number from England and a
round dozen from William K. Vander
bllt, the latter's youngsters being prac
ticafly the produce of the American
stallion Halma, by Hanover.
At 12 noon, the appointed starting
time, so few of the boats were on hand
that the firing of the preparatory gun
wu postponed till 12:65 o'clock p. m.
At 1 o'clock p. m. the starting gun was
flred from C. J. Vogel's launch Teal.
The yachts crossed the starting line
aa follows: Sloop Pollywog, 1:00:50 p.
m.; sloop Shamrock III, sailed single
handed by Howard Pratt, at 1:01:00 p.
m.; yawl Iola, sailed by Robert Vin
cent, at 1:01:10: sloop Mist, sailed by
F. F. du Brutz, at 1:01:15; yawl Pil
grim, sailed by J. Altendorf, at 1:03:15;
sloop Flirt, sailed by F. J. Ward, at
1:03:25. The yawl Iola rounded the
stakeboat oft! the mole for the first time
at 2:51:05 p. m.; the sloop Pollywog at
3:06:30; the sloop Shamrock III at 3:09;
the sloop Mist at 3:14:10, and the yawl
Pilgrim at 3:25:05. The yawl Pilgrim
and the sloops Flirt and Shamrock III
did not finish. The yawl Iola crossed
the finishing line at 4:27:15 p. m., her
elapsed and corrected time (she being
scratch boat) being 3 hours 27 minutes
15 seconds. The sloop Pollywog fin
ished at 4:47:20, in an elapsed time of
3:47:20, and a corrected time (after de
ducting her allowance of 25 minutes) of
3:22:20, beating Iola by 4 minutes 55
seconds. The sloop Mist finished at
5:21:20. in an elapsed time of 4:21:20, or
a corrected time (after deducting her
allowance of 45 minutes) of 3:36:20. C.
J. Vogel and A. G. Byxbee acted as
regatta committee. The water was
smooth and there was a moderate
southwesterly breeze. Commodore
George M. Shaw's yawl Idler cruised
about in the bay, but did not take part
in the race. No light sails were used.
The skipjack Pollywog, sailed by
GÂ«orge Tyler, won the Vincent Handi

A special musical programme was

which has been recently installed in
St. Mary's. The congregation was much
Impressed with the beautiful Instru
ment and experts pronounced it to be
one of the best organs In the city.
The sermon was preached by the
Rev. Father Superior Henry H. Wy
man, who said in part:
A priest is a divinely appointed intermediary
between God and mankind. The dutlea of his
office are two-foldâ one toward God, the other
toward mankind.
The character and power of the priesthood
emanate from Jesus Christ, who was both God
and man and the one mediator by whom man
is reconciled to God.
By the sacrament of holy orders Jesus Christ
Imparted to his apostles and their successors
for all time the power to offer himself upon
our altars. Besides th!? power he also con
ferred upon his priests the power of reconciling
penitent sinners to God and the commission to
preach the gospel of salvation.
The priest of God lives only to carry out the
divine work which has been intrusted to him.
Mr. and Mrs. Louis Friedman cele

wedding yesterday at their home, 1222
Eddy street. The house was beauti
fully decorated and the happy couple
Â¦were the recipients of numerous hand-'

their family and from their friends.
Visitors came from early morning un

hearty felicitations.
Mr. and Mrs. Friedman were mar

the same year came to New York.
In 1862 they journeyed to San Fran

Early yesterday morning Philosanos
Torres, a Porto Rican, objected to a
woman named Lena dancing with
Thomas Garrett, a colored man, and
showed his displeasure by . slashing
Garrett on the right arm with a razor.
Garrett was taken to the Harbor Hos
pital and Torres was arrested on a
charge of assault' wiWv- .a deadly
weapon. *
On Saturday night Dillard got into
a fight over the same woman and was
stabbed twice in the back. He was
taken to the Harbor Emergency Hos
pital. The police are looking for the
man who stabbed him.
The saloon of Dan Lopez, 408 Pa
cific street, is becoming notorious for
its stabbing affrays. On Friday night
Thomas Dillard and Rector Adams,
colored, quarreled over one of the
women who frequent the place and
dance with the patrons. Dillard
stabbed Adams and was arrested for
assault with a deadly weapon.

There was an electrical display at
Washington and Kearny streets for
about half an hour yesterday, but no
one was injured. A car had started
down Washington street about noon,
when one of the guide wires at the
corner was broken. One end dropped
to the track, the other rested on the
trolley wire and came in contact with
the rail. The wire on the track burned,
brightly and made a hole in the
asphalt. ' .
No one had the hardihood to at
tempt to disentangle the wires and a
telephone message was sent to the car
house. Inspector H. H. Oellig came
and got on top of a car. With a pair
of nippers he soon cut the wires. One
of the pieces in falling hit the brake of
the car and there was a report as if a
cannon had been fired. While Oellig
was working he was surrounded by
flashes of electricity a,nd the front of
his coat was burned.

The grocery of C. M. Duer at
2763 Mission street was entered by
burglars some time yesterday morning
Â¦between midnierht and 6 o'clock. The
thieves forced open a window on
Twenty-fourth street. The cash reg
i5ter was broken open and J25 taken
from the drawer. When the thieves
were ready to leave, after helping
themselves to what liquor they
wanted, they carried away 500 cigars.
Their exit was made by opening the
side door and walking out. The Mis
sion police were notified and Captain
Anderson detailed Detectives Graham
and Fitzgerald on the case.

Mr. Vance says American wine
growers have a common interest and
they should combine for mutual
benefit. He is the father of the Amer
ican Winegrowers' Association, the
purpose of which is to cement the in
terests of winegrowers in all the
States.
It is to be regretted that Frenchmen and
other foreigmers predominated on the wine Jury,
but California fared as well aa could be ex
pected under all the circumstances. Some of
your exhibitor* were careless, and the brands
they e*-nt were not worthy, of notice. In fact,
the great trouble out here is the lack of marked
individual brands, made and kept up to a fixed
EtanOard. Time alone will remedy these evils.
I look for marked improvement In the future.
IHiringr my stay I shall visit your wine grow
ing: areas.
Lee J. Vance, editor of the Ameri
can Wine Press of New York and
leading American juror at the Paris
Exposition, also at the St. Louis Fair,
is at the Grand, accompanied by his
sister. Though a New Yorker, Mr.
Vance is a strong friend of California
and her wine industry. When he ar
rived at St. Louis he declined to serve
as a juror until a Californian was
appointed, and through his efforts
Henry Lachman became a juror.
Speaking of the St. Louis Exposition
last night, he said:

So far as the employes are concerned
the action of the exchange will not af
fect them financially. The same work
ing hours will be observed and there
will be no alteration in the scale of
wages. The employers will simply re
serve the right to hire and discharge
men at will, regardless of their connec
tion with the union. As a prominent
dealer expressed it last night, "the mea
working for me can belong to a dozen
unions if they choose, or they need not
belong to any. All I look for is their
competency. I think I stand in the
same position as all the owners of meat
markets in this city when I say that I
will not discharge a man because he is
a member of a union, and I will not re
fuse employment to a competent man
because he is not a member. If they
choose to pay their dues to the union
it is none of my affair."
If the union men object to the â¢ new
order a test case will be made in one
of the larger markets. In case the men
employed the,re walk out the doors of
all the butcher shops in the city will be
closed until a settlement is reached.
The wholesalers are working with the
retailers, and it is said that retailers
who will not abide by the open shop
decision will have difficulty in procur
ing supplies from Baden and Butcher
town.
The Butchers' Exchange, an organi
zation composed of proprietors of retail
butcher shops throughout the city, yes
terday afternoon declared positively for
the "open shop." The new order goes
into effect this morning.
The meeting was called for the pur
pose of considering the question of un
ionism or non-unionism in the trade,
and is an outcome of the strike of the
sheep butchers at Butchertown. Any
man may work in a meat market with
or without a cardâ at least the owners
of the market say so. Just what action
the Journeymen Butchers' Union may
take on the matter remains to be seen,
as not sufficient time has elapsed for
official notification to be given that
body and action taken.
The trip was made without accident,
and all the children were delivered
Fa My to the consignees. John M.
Knight, the veteran excursion aeent.
was in charge of the party, which, he
pays, kept him busier than any other
carload of Western homeseekers he
ever handled.
A carload of New York babies came
West last week as part of the Southern
Pacific's overland limited, which, after
distributing this novel cargo at points
on the main line, arrived here yester
day morning.
There were fifty-seven little tots in
the party, ranging in age from one year
to four. They came out in charge of
several sisters of charity and trained
nurses. All the youngsters were in
mates of one of the great foundling
asylums in New York City and the in
stitution's agents in the West had
found homos in which the little people
would be adopted and carefully reared.
Eight of the children were left at
Houston. Texas, and the remaining
forty-nine were brought as far as
Clifton, Ariz., where the Pullman car
In which they had traveled from New
York was dropped from the train and
the young folks were taken in hand
by good people of that neighborhood.
The journey out West was a Kreat
event for the "kids." The spectacle of
a car in which every window displayed
a gmup of staring baby faces aroused
a vast dt>al of curiosity at all the sta
tions, and won for the young travelers
attentions often more generous than
Judicious. At every station where the
train's stay was long enough the chil
dren were bundled out of the car for a
bit of sunshine 'and fresh air. This
meant trouble for the nurses in round
inp up their charpes when the conduc
tor shouted "All aboard!" At nieht the
baliies were put to bed in bunches.
thrÂ«*e or four crosswise in each berth.
with their heads toward the window.
Policeman de Guire ran to the scene.
A large crowd had gathered and it was
some time before he could force his
way to the car. Meantime the mar
shal of the parade, followed by a dozen
members wearing badges, appeared
and fought the crowd back. It all
happened in a minute or two, which
was fortunate for Briggs, as he was
being roughly handled. He was pulled
away from his assailants and a space
was cleared, enabling him to start
the car, which went gliding down the
hill at a rattling speed, followed by a
number of the fishermen. They gave
up the chase when the car crossed
Montgomery street.
No arrests were made, as De Guire
was not able to pick out the men who
assaulted Briggs. Threats were made
that Briggs' conduct would be made a
subject for investigation by the Trades
and Labor Council, as he is a mem
ber of the Carmen's Union. He is an
ex-policeman.
There was an incipient riot at Sac
ramento and Kearny streets shortly be
fore 11 o'clock yesterday morning and
Andy Briggs, a gripmau on the Sac
ramento-street line, was for a time in
serious trouble.
The Fishermen's Union, to the num
ber of about 800, held a parade yes
terday morning. While crossing Sac
ramento street at Kearny Brings
drove his car through them and it was
said that two or three were knocked
aside. In an instant the car was
swarming with angry fishermen and a
combined attack was , made upon
Briggs. He was struck on the face
and thrown down. The car was
crowded with shrieking women. One
woman ran to the rear of the car and
shouted "Police, police! Help, mur
der!"
"York State Folks" entered upon the
second week of its run before. a large
audience at the Grand Opera-house last
night.- ,- ,
Ben Greet and his company of Eng
lish players will give their beautiful
production of the . morality .. play,
"Everyman," at Lyric Hall to-night
and all the week. There will be mat
inees Wednesday and Saturday. For
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday
nights and Wednesday and Saturday
matinees of next week . "Much Ado
About Nothing" will be the programme;
with Constance Crawley \ as Beatrice
and Ben Greet as Benedict. Thurs
day, Friday ar.d Saturday nights and
Friday afternoon of next week
"Twelfth Night" will be produced,
with Mrs. Crawley as Viola and | Mr.
Greet as Malvolio. There will be no
Sunday night performances.
The Majestic Theater stock company
last evening opened the week with
Bronson Howard's four-act comedy,
"The Henrietta," and the pretty white
and pink playhouse was crowded below
and above. The play is a story of
stocks, humor, love and villainy. An
old Napoleon of Wall street who pays
court to a handsome widow in the
short intervals he is not tossing the
bears, his older son who fleeces his
father, another son who is a somewhat
overdone Imitator of his fool of a titled
brother-in-law, and four pretty female
characters are the play people. J. H.
Gilmour is "safe," to use a stock term,
as "Old Nick" Vanalstyne, and his ex
cellent handling of the role bears out
all the good words that have been said
of him. Miss Grace Reals, as the
widow, was charming in person and
performance and very amusing, seem
ingly without trying to be so. Miss
Eleanor Gordon and Miss Vera Me-
Cofds were entertaining in their \ re
spective roles.' Henry Stoc'kbride, as
Bertie Vanalstyne, the , lamb, plays
the not-so-foolish-as-he-looks character
excellently and slips gracefully into
the- hero role . when there is â an un
worthy brother to sacrifice for winning
a full-house applause. The play will
continue all the week.
To San Franciscans,- who enjoy well
staged musical comedy, pretty girls
and well-conducted music a visit to
the California Theater this week and
next will prove of interest. "The Ten
derfoot" is playinR there and the catchy
tunes that have been whistled for the
last year may be heard with their ac>
companiment of fancy dances and in
tricate ensembles.
As for the cast, there is but little to
say. The company from the "Tender
foot" down is well worthy of the at
tractive play. The interest of the
rather intangible plot centers in Phil
Riley, as the tenderfoot. His imper
sonation is ludicrous without being
asinine, although a donkey was one of
his chief aids. Riley's good work is
evidenced by the fact that many of
the puns that would otnerwise fall flat
are delivered by him with unction that
pleases. Miss Mary Carrington, the
prima donna, has a fine voice and
pleasing personality. Tom K. Richey
in the lead captured the. feminine por
tion of the audience. He possesses
â¢what is so seldom seen in leading men
now-a-daysâ a manly appearance. His
singing was excellent, aa was that of
all the others in the cast. The four
Texas rangers, who supply a fair share
of the comedy, were good.
Teddy Webb of the Tivoli shouldn't
forget to ; take in Ted E. Box. "Mr.
Box, who is also from Lunnon, gives
a rank imitation of our Teddy. He
whistles well, but London could have
kept him for me. John P. Kennedy
and Carrie Reynolds dance again and
again well, and T. Trovollo still ven
triloquizes, tosthe delight of every one.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Hoey and Lee, Hebrew humorists at
the Orpheum this week, are extrava
gant, . Half their voice would go round,
andâ for meâ half their songs. Still,. the^
audience found them amusing. The
songs are the usual atrociously rhymed
and scanned affairs, set to anything
frc-m "Auld Lang Syne" to "Bedelia."
One is not particular about one's
Orpheum verse, but the galled ear
winces at "Cohan" rhymed to "mother
in-law." And one gets just that. Above
the, average again are the Hoey and
Lee jokes, and there is more in their
Hebraism than the big hat and flat
feet. It is by no means all caricature,
and in a good sketch they should be
able to entertain largely. As it is; the
audience whistled themselves hoarse.
Others new are Felix and the Barry
sisters, in a sketch by Edward Burton,
"The Bay From Next Door." Miss
Lydia Barry remarks, after a lightly
applauded imitation of Fay Temple
ton. "One of us must ba bad." It
wasn't Miss Templeton. Miss Barry's
imitation of a No. 9 eel in a No. 7 skin
was, however, quite convincing. The
sketch, with the Â¦ assistance of Mr.
Felix's very laughable appearance as
the boy from next door, evoked the
easy hysterics. Mr. Felix's nonchalant
fashion of walking off a chair on top
of a table to the floor helps vastly. A
light heel, about four and a half feet
of slim white satined prettlness and a
soft, fresh little pipe, are lent by Miss
Emily Barry. Miss Lydia furnishes
robust fun and any amount of snap.
Mme. Avery Strakosch is prima don- I
na of the bill. She has diamonds galore
to show for it, a gesture and a fair
voice, rather worn. Mme. Strakosch's
selections hit the popular taste and,
she was twice encored. She gave
"Beautiful Home of Paradise" and
Mabel McKinley's latest melange, "Ka
ra ma." The "Annie Laurie" and "Dix
ie" that followed were sung with
some taste and spirit.
But by much the best thing on the
bill is still Urbani's and his son's ac
robatics. This turn alone is worth go
ing for. The youngster Is the clever
est infant tumbler ever seen here. He
supports his father on his hands â hand
to handâ that colossal gentleman
swinging between the uplifted fists!
Last week's Two Pucks are other clev
er youngsters. They, the girl particu
larly, are already accomplished come
dians.
The dead man was" unmarried and
had no relatives in this city. At the
hotel where he made his home he -was
very popular and many expressions of
regret at his untimely death were
heard last evening. â¢
"Word was sent to the life saving sta
tion, but the efforts of the crew that
went out were of no avail. Although
careful search was made along the
beach the swimmer's body could not be
found.
W. P. Goldie was drowned at the
Ocean Beach shortly after noon yes
terday, while his friends, who. at first
thought he was playing a joke on them
but afterward realized that he was in
distress, were making, frenzied efforts
to save him. .
Goldie was an electrical engineer and
about 27 years of age. He came here
from, the East two years ago and for
several months, has been, staying at
The Johnston, O'Farrell and Leaven
worth streets. He was fond of outdoor
exercise and particularly of sea bath
ing. In company with R. C. Bossert
he left the hotel at abont 11 o'clock yes
terday morning. The two went to the
beach and at a point about a mile be
low the Cliff House disrobed and joined
two other salt water enthusiasts.
Goldie was the most venturesome of
the four and went out farther than the
others. Suddenly he threw up his
hands and began to call lustily for
help, saying he was drowning. His
companions thought at first that he
was only Joking, but later, when they
noticed that he was rapidly drifting
farther from shore despite his efforts
to come in, they realized that some
thing was wrong and started to his as
sistance. *Â¦
The men waded out until the water
was up to their necks, but found the
undertow so strong that they dared
not venture farther. At the same time
Goldie sank beneath the water with a
last despairing cry and was seen no
more.
