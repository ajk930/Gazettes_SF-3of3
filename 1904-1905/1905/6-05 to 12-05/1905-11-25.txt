SENSATION IN TRIAL
OF MERIWETHER.
Admiral McCormick, a Member of the
Court, Challe?iged as Case Near s End.
Ep*cUl Dispatch to Tbe CalL
AKXAPOIJS. Md., Nov. riâ One of tlie
most remarkable incidents in the history
of naval courts-martiaL-In this cojuntry
marked to-das-'s session of the court
\u25a0which is tryinp Midshipman Minor Meri
w-ether Jr. in connection with the fight
between himself and Midfhipman James
H. Branch. Rear Admiral Alexander H.
ilcCormick. next in point of rank of the
members of the court to Admiral Ram
sey, its president, was challenged by
Judge Advocate Marix after the whole
testimony for the prosecution had been j
submitted. " /
The grounds for the challenge appeared
after the beginning of the trial, and were,
first, that Admiral McCormick had con
sulted with a high medical authority
(Medical Director Walton, U. S. N., re
tired) In relation to the case; second, that
he had by his repeated and continued
cross-examination of the prosecution's
witness practically taken the place of the
counsel for the accused, and, third, that
he had evinced the possession of a theory
in the case which was co deeply rooted
that It would be impossible to mbye it by
the evidence^ â¢ , â¢
"I have had a conversation with Medi
cal Inspector Thomas C. Walton," said
Admiral McCormick. "I did this in order
that I might, ask guch questions of the
witnesses brought before the court as
would affirm or negative the possibility
of Branch's! death having occurred In
the manner charged. I am fully aware
thai in the end I- must reach my conchi
eions upon the testimony of the witnesses
before this court and in that manner
only."
The court was then cleared and upon
Its | being reopened Admiral Ramsey an
nounced that the challenge against Ad
rr.iral McCormick had not been sustained.
Only second In point of interest to the
challenge entered against Admiral . Mc-
Cormick was the court's determination to
request the Secretary of the Navy to or
der that the body of the late Midshipman
Branch be exhumed and an autopsy held.
It is not certain how much can he re
vealed by an autopsy upon the remains of
Midshipman Branch, whose death oc
curred three weeks aco. but it is believed
that almost absolute information . can be
obtained as to the existence of any pre
vious diseased . condition of _â¢_ the heart,
brain or other organs, such as would have
made death possible at the . time from
any other cause than the blows received
in the fight. . ;
Tbe defense offered two witnesses dur
ing the forenoon session. They were Mld
thipman Herbert B. Labhart. a classmate
and former roommate of Meriwether, and
Midshipman Norman Smith, a first class
man. â -'^'
Labhart was called to show that Branch
had done things to Meriwether calculated
to make good his assertion that he
"would make life not worth living for
him," but his testimony was not particu
larly strong.
During the course of Midshipman
Smith's testimony, .nlted States District
Attorney Ros* of Baltimore; who is as
sociated In the prosecution with Judge
Advocate Marlx, took a keen Interest in
tbe evidence given that flgnting had in
creased since hazing was "knocked out"
at t^e academy. He brought out . very
clearly by hi? qutÃtiona that the midship
men were still compelled to do various
fillip things and obey ridiculous orders, the
Impelling force being the fact that if
they do not prove tractable, they must
Â£ght, whereas, they were formerly com
pelled to do the same thing by the.im
position of phyEical cruelty In the shape
of hazing:.
NASHVILLE, Term., Nov. 24.â The ven
erable Mrs. G. M. Goodlett of this "city.

tial in connection with his encounter with
Branch: ".' '

TRIES TO ROB
STRONG BOX
AT NAVY-YARD
Thtef Pays Visit to
Paymaster's Office
on Mare Island. ;
"VAL.LEJO,' Nov. 24.â A bold attempt
was | made to rob Uncle 'Sam of Â£ $75,000
to-night on Mare Island.' But for the
vigilance of. a marine sentry named Ew
ing it is probable that the -attempt would
have been . successful. As Ewlng was
patrolling his beat in the neighborhood
of - the .Administration- building he
thought he noticed- some one in. the office
of the paymaster of the yard, which is
on the ground floor of the r big building.
He quickly made his way to the office
and entered. ,
As he stepped- inside the door he was
struck a stunning blow oh the head. The
blow dazed him, but he . quickly turned
and grappled with ,'a'- man he 'saw try
ing to dart out ttie door. \u25a0
For several, minutes the" intruder and
the plucky marine struggled. Finally the
guard was knocked ' to the; floor and the
would-be thief rushed from the building.
The marine followed as quickly. as he
could, picking up his gun as he ran.
He caught sight of the fleeing 'figure
of his, late opponent and fired at him,
but evidently without success as the
\u25a0man" did not .stop, . but continued run
ning until lost to view in the darkness.
The shots aroused the entire yard and
within a very few minutes armed ma
rines were searching for th% stranger. Up
to a late hour they found no trace of
him. .. â¢
Had the thief succeeded in opening the
paymaster's safe 'he would have secured
$75,000. brought to the yard to-day to pay
off the employes of Uncle Sam to-morrow.'

that there was' any "trouble between

nlcM an official of the organization
stated unqualifiedly - that ,, : Beaver's
shortage, sm \u25a0: far \u25a0as discovered. Is
910,000 and may exceed 920,000.:
'\u25a0 Beaver came. here, some ycarsago-from
San Bernardino, and was -appointed to
his: present "position 'after the assocja-"
tion had disco vered; that it had ;been
robbed of more than $100,000" by a gang

case of'&rthird is* pending on appeal. :>â¢."â¢?
After,'- Beav er. T v took" charge 'things
went well /for a time and the associa- J
tion*^ business -prospered. The" death
of 'his wife, seemed^ to 'unnerve Beaver
and caused, him to "cast aside restraint.
During the past several months he has
Imbibed much more than is good for
him' and his associations, havenot at all
times, been with the best people..
By merest accident a discrepancy of
$1300 was, discovered in , his accounts
and this opened the way to other dis
closures which revealed a surprising
state of 'affairs. ', 'dissipation' and un
profitable realty speculations 'had
made Beaver careless and he is al
leged to have -so tangled up his ac
counts with the association that it will,
require much time -to straighten them.
Among other things he -is alleged to
have ' negotiated Joans for people'here,
and after receiving the money convert
ed it to his own usa and reported to
the association that tne loan had been
refused. It is 'also alleged that in the
sales of property belonglng^to the.com
pany he has so juggled â¢ deeds ;' and
mortgages as to' be able to make money
for .himself out' of both:, . An^ofncial
of the company said to-night: . .
"He has been going a swift pace and
we have given him bis choice between
settling and I going' to jail. 4 I do 'not
nee how he can settle. Mr. ,, Corbin,
manager of the company, will be here
to-morrow and then' some definite steps
will be taken. It 1* probable that; a
criminal complaint will be issued to
morrow. There ; is one feature of this
serious vase which is. amusing In the
light of past events. When charged
with the. shortage and threatened with
arrest . Beaver , became "very angry and

WASHINGTON 1 . Not. 21.â Senator For
aker to-day presented to the Senate Com
mittee on Interstate Commerce the draft
of his bill to amend the Interstate Com
merce law. The Senator stated that he
had tried' to meet the complaints against
present railroad conditions and -at tRe
same time avoid conferring upon the
Interstate Commerce Commission or any
similar body the power over . railroad
rates. M*y*p"V^B
The Foraker bill, however, provides for
enjoining the publishing and charging of
excessive rates and for enjoining any
discriminations forbidden by law, wheth
er as between shippers, places, commodi
ties or otherwise, and whether affected
by means cf rates, rebates, classifications,
private â¢ cars, preferentlals, "or in any
other manner whatever." While this
does not confer upon the court the power
to fix a rate It does authorize the court
to say what is an unlawful rate and how
much is unlawful, and to enjoin the car
rier from charging 'more than is found to
be lawful. The bill also is designed to
prohibit" the (giving of passes, to allow
free access to railroad documents and to
meet complaints as to rail rates, and as to
export \ and-' lmpqrt freight. J The . import-.,
ant provisions of the Foraker bill -are
contained in a section which amends sec

th,ls i morning for . Port Leavenworth,
Kans, on a special train conveying sev
Â«nty-one Federal prisoners, who are being
transferred from, the Missouri State Peni
tentiary to the Government prison at Fort
Ixavenworth. It ie believed that this fact
had much to do with the outbreak to
day, as it ia surmised the convicts had
counted largely upon Warden Hall's- ab
eence, in their premeditated attempt to
escape.
GATEMA.\ SHOT DOW.V.
There was not the slightest premonition
of any trouble within the prison walls.
Suddenly Convicts Harry Vaughn, Charles
Raymond, Hiram Blake, George Ryan
and Eli Zelgler, who were working in
proximity to the prison gate inside
the inclosure, as If by a given signal
made a ruth for the gate. From their
pockets they drew pistols and it is pre
eumed that at least one of them carried
a bottle of nitro-giycerin. Where these
ueapons and the explosive were obtained
ha? not yet been discovered. â¢
Rushing past the gate, they entered
Deputy Warden So^'e offlce and shot him
as be sat in his chair. He sank back and
was enable to resist them. Instantly
they returned to ihe gate and met Gate
man John Clay, who had been alarmed by
the shots. Before he could raise his
\u25a0weapon he was shot dead. Then, as if
to signal the convicts generally that the
attempt to escape had been started, the
convicts seized ti.e Ltll rope hanging by
the gate and rang the bell.
Guard E. Allison, who was attracted by
tbe shooting, was their next victim. He
was shot ti.rough the head and died al
most instantly.
Galeman Clay had left the wagon gate
ajar. When he attempted to close it he
was shot Â«]cid. The convicts rushed
through, dragging his body with them,
slammed the gate chut and fastened It on
the inside. Thsy weie then in the wagon
entrance to the penitentiary, this en
trance being about forty feet long by fif
teen feet wide, and leading to the public
street through another double gate of
steel. This outside gate was locked, but
the desperadoes were, deterred but for a
moment. Placing their nitro-glycerin un
der the outside gate, they blew an open-
Ing through the massive steel doors and
before the smoke had cleared from the
opening they had dashed through past a
number of "trusty" convicts working In
the Â«treet, and ran madly for twelve
blocks. Zeigler. it was found, had failed
to leave the penitentiary walls.
Almost before the four escaping con
victs had covered the distance of one
block the prteon officials Ijeavily armed,
vrere In pursuit, shooting- as they ran.
Pedestrians jumped behind trees, ran into
houses and crouched down behind any ob
stacle that presented refuge. Those liv
ing In houses along the. line, of flight,
al&rmcd by the shooting, rushed out to
ascertain the cause.. Women screamed
and fled, while tbe majority of the men

EMPLOYERS STAXD FIRM.
Decline to Confer .\Vtth Striken Until
the National Assembly* Act*.
ST. PETERSBURG.* Nov. Â«.--^The,em
ployers of St. Petersbure'have taken the'
lead In resistance to the workmen, whose
constant strikes alternately on political
and economic grounds have utterly de
moralized the business of the country and
are bringing ruin and bankruptcy to all
branches of industry. They have formed
an association, with Herr" Nobel at its
head, and have mutually pledged them
selves not only., to refuse strike pay, but
absolutely to decline to treat with their
employes on questions of wages. or hours
of work until the National Assembly acts.
Count Witte, In behalf of the' Gover
nment, has seconded the employers *by' di
recting that identical action be taken at
the Government works, and both the
Government and the private" workmen
have been given ontil Monday to -return
to work or be locked out indefinitely.
The men are already suffering from ex
cessive privations, and unless they :yield
they will soon be driven to desperation
by hunger. The employers . do not; enter
tain a doubt that In face of their united
front the men will surrender. The Gov
ernment probably will sustain - the . em
ployers at Moscow and elsewhere" in a
similar fashion. â¢ -' \u25a0 " - . - â¢â¢'
The workmen are thoroughly saturated
with Socialist and revolutionary j doc
trines. At their meetings the orators tell
them, as the creators of all wealth, the
factories belong to the workmen and the
land to the peasants. A deputation of
workmen actually went to. an English
owner proposing to take charge of his
mill. The. only concession-- they would
make was to elect him manager. They
marched to the ' Westinghouse factory
with red flags and threatened ' to batter
down the doors unless they â¢ were ad
mitted to hold a meeting. . Twenty-three
private establishments, employing 25,000
men, will be affected if a lockout Is de
clared. .. - \u25a0 \u25a0 .

found much ice as they! proceeded west, but

ment before the committee: - \u0084 ;
The result* desired by me President -should
be accomplished,- but If they can be- secured
without conferring the ratemakinjc power on
the Interstate * Ccynmef-ce Commission or any
other Government, agency a. number of very
troublesome legal -questions will be avoided,
such as tha -.constitutional prohibition about
giving preforence- to the ports k>l one State
over, those ef another;, the.- right to delegate
legislative power, and all questions as to the
power ' of the courts to review the legislative
act cf making. rates except in cases that are
conflscatory,. etc. ' : .'-\u25a0â¢.â¢. '\u25a0\u25a0â¢\u25a0 * â¢
1 -.WILL STOP- DISCRIMINATION.
The great evil to be .reached and dealt with
is dlrcrlmln.il. This takes ihe form of dis
crimination > between j localities and individuals.
It ' is practiced under numerous devices, such
an terminal charges, elevator charges, refrig
erator charges, private par line charges, classi
fication, false weights, ' refusal ' to " supply ' cars
equally to shippers v and in numerous other
ways. . \u25a0 w- .â¢\u25a0\u25a0:...â¢; .-'. - '\u25a0\u25a0.-".\u25a0â¢â¢â¢ -\u25a0 - -,â¢Â»-.
- The basis of the, most Important feature of
the bill I have presented is the third section
of the Elklris act.' I have sought to amend it
so aa to make. it< applicable not only to every
form of 'discrimination - that -.can arise, \u25a0 but
also to excessive rates as well as rebates, and
I have' sought to make the law available to
the humblest shipper In the land and to make
it â¢; immediately respected whenever he may
fee the necessity to invoke It. - - ;
â¢ Tho proposition of .the bill is that upon com
plaint and. the showing of cause the bill shall
be heard- on: Its merit* in we first instance in
the court, where full relict can be granted.
This is not -a delay to the shipper, because
it will take nÂ» longer,; statins It conservatively/
to try .the case .before, the court,:ln^the flrst
InBtanio. thaii it would to^ iry.lt before the In
terstate/Cdmmsrce. Commission;- and.-the -prob
abilitios are 'that any Judge of the Circuit
Court of the United States accustomed to hear
ing : witnesses, applying tne law and dlspoaing
of legal questions. Bitting m equity, would try
the cane In much less time than the : Interstate
Commerce Commission or any other associate
body would require. . ' â¢ '\u25a0
The propriety 61 going In the first instance
to tho court where a remedy can be adminis
tered is manifest: when it U remeraberea that
every - case . must.vif the partieSi to it are so
disposed .go to the court anyhow before âit
Is ** ended, for" it is the constitutional right of
every one to have his- day in court and that
right cannot t* taken away by Congress even
if , there were . a . disposition to do so.
PROHIBITS GIVING OF PASSES.
Another" feature of the bill proi-ides for the
appointment- of expert examiners, who, under
the direction of the Interstate Commerce Com
mission can make an examination at any time
of ' all books, 'documents and papers of any
railroad * that relate to Interstate transporta
tion of commerce. -This 'will -enable the com
mission, to ascertain, tbe. facts and secure evi
dence. Another . provision of the bill I* de
signed to prohibit the givfng of passes. This
provision needs no comm*it.
Another provision prohibits the carrying of
freight that-ia to bÂ£ exported or freight, that
has been imported On' through rates less as. to
rail ' portion r . charge than Is exacted for the
carrying of similar domestic shipments between
the same points - J unless the carriage be in
ships of American â¢ registry. The amount \u25a0of
freight, carried an these lower through rates
Is constantly 'increasing and" there is a con
stantly" growing complaint from manufacturers
on thls.adcount. ,- This* provision will not be la
conflict with any of our reciprocal treaties and
It Is hot without precedent, for = practically the
saint- kind of measures tiave been resorted ' to
by r both Russia and- Germany and probably
also'by -othf* countries. , I i* >f ;

three times. / "l brlugr him back to life. We pray." â Mrs. De Paoli.
est!hour of yesterday morning compelled
the husband to commit fearful murder.-
Believing m his heart tnat his sister
in-law, Mrs. Catherine de Paoli, who was
trj-lng to. help .the crazed family ;at the
time, had cast' a speil over himself, his
young wife and their three little ones,
and tnat they were all about to cue be
cause of her mystic witchery, Louis de
Paoli . seized a heavy oaken chair and
struck her on the head with it. Once
he struck and she fell to the lloor sense
less. Again he crashed the heavy wooden
chair across her prostrate form. , It broke
into a dozen pieces from the force .of the
blow. Then, demonlike In his ferocity, he
reached for a great block of wood that
was lying -by the kitchen stove. Stand
ing over her quivering body he struck and
struck until the head was crushed be
yond recognition and the woman lay still
in death.
PR A VS. TO EVIL SPIRIT
TO REMOVE THE CPEL.I<
Then the man fell upon his knees and
prayed. Not to God In heaven, but to the
spirit .of the evil one. - He prayed to an
unknown power, the power'which she be
lieved had begun to rule his life and haii
made him do murucr. Xot once did he ask
forgiveness for his crime.'. He 'believed
that he had done no wrong. He prayed
with all the fervor* of his ./soul that the
spirit of death surrounding, his family be
removed and that he be allowed to be
once more a free nian." . ; ' /
At his side was being enacted an
other tragedy, not of death, but of liv
ing fanaticism. The â¢ young; -mother,
believing that she was acting. under a
message from an unseen -power, was
whipping the three little children >to
keep them from falling 7 asleep,'/ "the
spirit of death, she thoug*i. /UntilVthe
break of day she whippw .them- and
then at times ceased the whipping; for a
moment while she prayed to Godto def
liver them from the power of 'the".*evii
one. Motherlike. she cried rln grief
when the little , ones ' screamed . In agony
from the lashes of the whip, but fa
natic that she was, she would hot cease
for fear that they would fall asleep
and.be lost, to her forever. ' - â¢
Then. came the dawn. Seven o'clock!
and the praying and whipping. had not j
ceased. . Shortly after Antonio de Paoli,
brother of the man who had' committed
the murder during the; night and .hus-i
band of the 'murdered woman, came to
the door* to see why -his wife had not
come home, to cook the breakfast.
Louis met; him at the door 'and told '
him that his wife was dead. Antonio ran
to got help.,
/ 'A little later two saloon. men of the
neighborhoodâ D. Brasottl and Joseph
Lecari â were attracted by the screams j
of the children. They peered through
: the kitchen' window and saw the man ; ;
' and his wife on their, knees : praying-/ !
On the floor a* few feet away., lay .the \
bloody . : corpse " ; of n Mrs. [ Catherine 'i "de !
Paoli. It had not been, moved' from the ;
spot nor .had any attempt : been. made |
toconceal it. .- Horror-stricken; at:>thÂ« j

took them. \u25a0 .
That night the, spirit of the evil one
talked, to Mrs." Louis dePacli. It said
to her: "Do not let any one in your house
hold sleep on the eighth night from this.
If sleep comes to any one you will all
die." ~ . .
She told the message: to her husband
and 1 they worried over it. . They believed'
that the pellets which 'they had taken
were possessed of the* devil and that they
were under the spell. .
The eighth day was Thursday and the
eighth night Thursday, night. AH day
Thursday De Paoli and his wife prayed
in their house, sometimes- to; God, some
times to the saints, . and: in \u25a0 moments of
fanatic, insanity to the devil. That even
ing they went over to the house of the
brother, Antonio. Antonjp asked them ;
what was the matter, an<T they told him -\
that they were not well and asked him
to come to the. church with them to pray.
Antonio would not go. but: allowed his
wife, Catherine/ to accompany, them. ;

CATHERINE ATTKMPTS TO

Catherine laughed at their folly, as she
thought,. and went on. undressing the,lit
tle ones. She soon saw that. the parents
were in earnest and. desisted. ', Meanwhile,
as the family^sat there, "the thought -be
gun to grow that Catherine was trying to
kill them all. -"Had she not \u25a0 tried to
bring on ' sleep?" was the question that
troubled Louis and his wife.
The little ones: could hardly bo kept

The mother, grave | them Ito make

eral hundred yards along the side of the

had her throat cut open and a particle
of food which had lodged there re
moved. The operation was performed
on the train between Sparks and Reno

It was not necessary to stop the train.
The unfortunate young lady was given
an anesthetic and placed on a hastily
constructed operating table in a Pull
man car. A sliver tube was inserted in
her throat In order that she might
breathe while the operation was being
performed. The operation was quite
successful and the young woman will

due the fact that the troublesome par

The fifty-year franchise referred to was
recently applied for by 'the new owners
of the Santa Clara street road, which is
at present operated under a franchise
having eighteen years yet>to run. Many
of the members of the Federated and
Building Trades Councils "; maintain that
the , extension of time should not "be
'granted unless the new owners give defl
/nite* assurances that \u0084 they will broad
gauge the and make the equipment
up to date.iand for this reason a hearing
before the Council was desired. . /â¢
The Santa Clara street road was bought
three weeks* ago by a-toterie of capital

The ; Nevada County, newspapers take a
cheerful view; of ..mining in 'California.
The Grass. Valley Union, foX instance,
editorially, says: '- . ' '
. California has "a greater variety of mineral
products than any other State in the Unlan.
Gold stands at the head of the lint." No accu
rate record of the â¢ gold production I has ( ever
been kept,' owing to the reticence of mine own-,
ers and the difficulty of tracing the output of
their properties but up to the end of 1904 It Is
officially estimated that the State's total out
put â¢of gold approximates ? 1,400, 000. 000 and
that the annual production is about $18,000,000.
While the, bulk of the shallower < auriferous
ground which yielded such enormous, wealth in
the earlier - years of gold mining b/as long
since been worked out. placer mining Is by no
means at an end. The auriferous, gravels " in
the State ' will give profitable ; employment to
the -miner for decadea to come. New gold
bearing deposits are discovered every - year ana
no limitation can be put on the life of placer
mining in the State.: Dredge mining develop
ment Is now being prosecuted in many, sections
and most satisfactory returns are received.
The perpetuity of gold mjnlng in California,
however, depends more on: Its gold : bearing
ledges than on > its auriferous fields. ; Quartz
mining is Increasing with wonderful rapidity.
The permanency of the veins ? and \u25a0 their \u25a0 con
tinued productlvenees at increasing depths have
established their value. The methods of" ex
traction and reduction and i the 1 cheapness cf
power have greatly reduced I the . cost of opera
tion in, late years. Ore bodies carrying- but
small values are worked at a good profit. . T Low
grade ores are treated by the same processes in
use in the Transvaal and at lower cost. " '
- Not in many years have the prospects of the
mining industry in ". California been as bright
:as at the present 'time. â¢ ;

portunities for. the mining industry in this
country::, ;"
. The time is here in this country where co- N
operation, not competition, is the potent force
in: getting things done. The bankers co-operate;
transportation lines ; co-operate. . Their co
operation is legitimate when based on honesty
of. purpose, and is the greatest method yet dis
covered to prevent waste and financial and In
dustrial J disaster. Those forces which.* when
wisely directed, are most potent for good, may
when ignorantly or dishonestly directed, be
most destructive to the - welfare of a - people.
The wholesome uncovering of vicious methods
of | directing the great i financial affairs of our
country twiU point the way \to better methods
mi this co-operative ; tendency In the \u25a0 field of
business and -finance.;-.: We as yet little realize
what a I mighty influence .. on business tenden
cies may 1 be exercised by an organization *enr
erously supDorted by mining men and periodi
cals, thoroughly representative of the mining
Industry.*; and with honesty and wisdom ruling
Its councils..-. ..;,;,:,....â¢\u25a0
It; is believed by many that the co-operation
of: our Government with the miner, aÂ» It now
co-operates with the farmer, through a De
partment; of Mines: and, Mining of equal dig
nity with the Department of Agriculture, would
be of incalculable benefit to the mining Indus
try;: that, for, Instance, our prospectors, miners
and mlninsr- Inventors are entitled to the most
careful governmental investigation of mineral
districts and formations.- and the best wayg'of
treating the Infinite variety of ores in which
this country abounds, and that they have the
same right to official information on these mat
ters that the farmer has to official information
in â¢ regard to , crop . culture which is so effec
tively supplied to him by the Agricultural De
partment. It also seems to them that. foreign
markets . for \u25a0 some of t our s - mineral , products
might be Increased by proper governmental ac
tion., in much ' the same way that such co
operation has developed s markets : for certain
agricultural products - abroad: -- ; If : the question
be : considered one simply of dollars and cents,
they, are Inclined to believe that 1 In - the ways
indicated a Department l of Mines arid Mining
would pay . for itself many times over In direct
benefits to the. mining and affiliated industries.
It appears ' to them that mining and farming
stand on an equal footing as the great primary

MANSFIELD IS
UN EQUALED
No memory of "A Parisian . Romance".
ffems Quite bo classically ; loathsome as
the original vrfeea Mr. .Mansfield Is the
}-'aron Chevrial of thÂ« cast. It may not
l-e so. but last night the ; actor seemed
to have added new shock to the horrors
of the portrait. . More exquisitely com
pete in Its detail it seemed, more hor
ridly, creepily truthful In its suggestion.
J^ast year Mr. Mansfield precluded his
Ohevrial with a Prince Karl in "Old Hel
delberr." It was another, kind, but no
treat strldÂ« from his crookback Richard
of the olstit before last to last night's
Chevrial. The other night a master
piece of medieval villainy; last nl^ht a
masterpiece of modern corruption. And
co Mansfield season would be complete
without "A Parisian Romance." which as
vltallr as "Beau Brummel" leans upon
the Mansfield Individuality. A large au
<s!er.cÂ«, on a grim titter tit the grim
humor of the Baron the night through,
welcomed the play.
One could wish it followed by a
"Ghosts," with a Mansfield as the Os
wald. And why not? Or by a "Mrs. War
ren's Profession," a trilogy of transgres
sion. Certainly "Mrs. Warren's Profes
sion" Is no more "unpleasant." as Mr.
Bhaw puts It, than the Baron ChevriaTÂ«.
It is difficult to imagine anything more
\u25a0unpleasant than Mansfield's Chevrial.
The make-up ia wonderful as ever. It
lias become historic â the pasty cheek with
iis dull. hÂ«ctio epot, the fishy eye. the
loose, lapping lips, the sagging neck,
hollow chest, shambling legs, foul to the
bona thÂ« man seems. It was as grimly
amusing as ever where this wreck aeks
for hla dumbbells, advises his doctor that
were he a saint he would have no need oi
his services and the rest. So, too. the
death ecene holds Its old thrill, and more.
It is all great In its way as anything that
Mansfield does, and done as could no one
else do it.
The supporting cast is expectedly happy
In Leslie Kenyon's De Targy. a manly
and most likable figure, distinguished in
manner and most spirited in action. Miss
Florence Rockwell is the Marcelle and
much more fortunate here than she has
bo far been in her opportunities. She
presents the role 'with grace and convic
tion. Eleanor Barry, too. Is a sweet and
appealing figure 'as the mother. Here
endeth the good fortunes of the cast, the
Rosa Ouerin, in spite of her wicked scar
let gown, being an unsuitably lakylike
person as Irene Prahar sees her. Chev
rlals wife Is played with as little con
viction by Adelaide Xovak.
The banquet scene was, as usual, splen
did, the play produced throughout in the
handsomest fashion.
This afternoon Mansfield will appear
ftgain as Shylock, one of his most ad
mirable achievements, and to-night in
the Schiller play "Don. Carlos." another.
BLANCHE PARTIXGTON.
BALFOUR WILL
RETAIN OFFICE
LONDON. Nov. 24. â To-day's Cabinet
Council, which, although not originally
summoned for that purpose, had to de
cide the question of resignation or tem
porary prolongation of the retention of
office by the Balfour Ministry, was at
tended by all the members with the
exception of the Marquis of Salisbury,
president of the Board of Trade. Only
a few score of people gathered in the
vicinity of Downing street to witness
th^ assembling of the Ministers and
there was no demonstration.
It is understood that the proposal for
tfcÂ«e collective resignation of the Cabi
net was rejected and that the Minis
ters arrived at the decision that It
would be better to . dissolve Parlia
ment themselves and appeal to the
electorate. Should this, course be fol
lowed It would be due largely to the
well-grounded belief that the Liberals
would decline to form a Cabinet before
a general election places them in the
possession of an adequate Parliamen
tary majority to carry out the Liberal
programme.
All doubt as to whether or not the
Marquis of Londonderry had consented
to remain In the Cabinet was dispelled
later by a statement from the Minis
ter himself to the effect that he had
not resigned. It is officially intimated
that no statement regarding the dcci-
Bion of the Cabinet will be issued by
the Ministers, but the fact that Bal
fcur.left London to-night until Mon
day and the additional fact that he is
rot going to Sandringnam to see the
King is taken as confirmation of the
understanding that the Premier and
his colleagues have decided against
precipitate resignation.

""I began to use It 4 years; ago. For
several years prior to that time I was a
great sufferer from stomach and heart
trouble and headache. I consulted the
best medical talent, but medicine did
me no good, and ray condition seemed
to grow - worse instead of improving,
till I was practically given over as a
confirmed invalid. SmSVwBI
"Finally a doctor suggested that I
stop coffee drinking, and although I
was loth to do so, I compiled. I was
visiting my son-in-law. In Ottawa, at
the time. He wee a Postum drinker,
and,at his urgent recommendation I be-
pan its use. It did not appeal to me at
first, but I found that this was because
it was not boiled long enough. When
it was made right I relished it. : .
"In due time, after the coffee effects
had passed out of my system so that
Postum could do its work. I began to
get better in every symptom. My stom-

became normal. My heart action was
restored to a healthy status, the head-

Forty Thousand Paid
to Partner of J. P. Morgan
by New York Life Company
BIG SU3I FOR HAMILTON
More Sensational Testimony
Given in the Insurance
Investigation in Gotham
NEW YORK, Nov. 24.â Startling devel
opments were brought out at .to-day's
session of the Armstrong committee on
Insurance investigation In the course of
a searching inquiry by Mr. Hughes, coun
sel for the committee, into the syndicate
transactions participated in by the New
York Life Insurance Company. The most
important witness of the day was Milton
M. Madison, a bookkeeper of the New
York Life Insurance Company. During
Madison's examination It was brought
out that in the case of the United States
Steel Corporation syndicate, the managers
of which were J. P. Morgan & Co., there
appeared In one Instance a profit due to
the New York Life of $87,185, from which
was deducted, no reason being given
therefor, the sum of. $59,810 paid to An
drew Hamilton, who has been described
In the course of the Investigation as the
"Insurance legislative generalissimo."
It appeared from records produced by
Hughes that an account of J. P. Morgan
& Co. with Hamilton showed that in De
cember, 1901, that firm â¢ had advanced to
Hamilton the sum of $56,720; that on Oc
tober L 1902. this amounted with interest
to $59,310, and that it was then canceled by
the entry of that amount to Hamilton's
credit. The entry of this amount in the
account of the New York Life read "as
per statement and arrangement with Mr.
G. W. Perkins." It was also developed
that the participation in the syndicate of
the New York Life was effected through
the New York Security and Trust Com
pany, by which -one-fourth of the profits
of the former company were retained.
BIG SUM FOR PERKINS.
Pressed by Hughes to .tell whether he
knew of any other instance of money due
to the New York Life being paid to a
third party, as in the Hamilton case.
Madison recalled the payment In 1904 of
$40,000 to George W. Perkins, representing
the profit on a loan of $930,000 to the Bos
ton firm of Kidder, Peabody & Co. The
profit, the witness said, came in the form
of a check on the First National Bank,
which he cashed, giving the money to
Perkins.
What the latter did with It the witness
did not know. No entry of. the transac
tion w^a made on the books of the New
York Life. â¢ Other witnesses examined
during the day w^re George T. Wilson,
fourth vice president of the Equitable:
francls "W. Jackson, auditor; and Gerald
R. Brown, in charge of the bond depart
ment of the Equitable-
Gerald R. Brown of the Equitable Life
Assurance Society was the first witness
called by the insurance investigating
committee to-day. Brown, in reply to
questions, said that the King model houses
in 13Sth street. New York, were taken by
the Equitable Society under a foreclosure,
sold to D. H. King Jr., and that the
Equitable Society supplied $3,100,000 for
construction and improvements. Mean
time the society held a mortgage on the
houses, and when completed King deeded
them back to the society. Brown said he
supposed King "was there" to make a
profit in sub-letting the contracts.
"The Equitable put up all the money
and King took all the profits?" asked
Hughes.
"Yes, if you want to put it that way,"
said Brown.
"What officers were responsible for this
transaction?"
"The executive committee," said
Brown, who lidded that Henry B. Hyde
had the matter in charge.
FINANCIER WILL EXPLAIN.
Milton M. Madison, a bookkeeper in
the offices of the New York Life Com
pany, testified that the New York Se
curity and Trust Company participated in
the United States Steel Corporation .syn
dicate to the extent of $2,325,000.
Hughes produced a blotter . showing
that the New York Life Insurance Com
pany received from the Security and
Trust Company $52,417 as a three-quarters
profit of the account. Madison* said the
New York , Life Insurance Company did
not pay any money on that account, but
had deposited $2,325,000 with the Security
and Trust Company. George W. . Per
kins, vice president of the New York
Life Insurance Company, had charge of
the transaction and J. P. Morgan & Co.
were the syndicate managers.
The committee adjourned until Monday
morning.
. George W. Perkins, of the firm of J.
P. Morgan & Co., to-night gave out, the
following statement in regard to the tes
timony brought out in the insurance.in
vestigation to-day: v ./. ,C.\>v^ v
"The transactions referred to before
the investigating committee to-day \u25a0, were
the proper ones. If the natural course
of the inquiry does not make this clear,
I am sure the committee will ,. give ;me
an opportunity to offer further testi
mony in the matter."
BOSTON. Nov. 24.â A member of the
firm of Kidder, Peabody & Co., of this
city, on being shown a copy of the testi
mony of Bookkeeper Madison of the New
York Life Insurance Company at the in
surance investigation to-day with refer
ence to an alleged loan of $920,000 to the
Boston firm, said:
"There never was any such transaction.
The statement is either a mistake or a
misstatement." ,

tor : J. Ralph Burton of, Kansas, charged
with violating a; Federal statute by,prac
ticing before the . Postofflce | Department
as an attorney, must be submitted to the
jury to-morrow. Judge Vandevanter said
that he had : no ; wish to ; curtail { . the time
of counsel . for argument, , but that as ; to-,
morrow was the last j day of thew week he
thought that the case should be con-
eluded in time to give the jury all of Sun
day, if necessary, to consider the' evi
dence. ' j-;*~ '..'\u25a0,: ...
The attention of J the. "court was occu
pied to-day with the^closing of t the | de
fense, ' '; .which began * yeSrferflay \nobn, and
the first argument* for the prosecution,'
delivered by Assistant United States At

remain 'the argximents* for' the '-defense,
.which will be made by Attorney Lehmann
>of St. Lous and Attorney Haynes ; of Chi
cago, and the final argument for the Gov
ernment by District Attorney Dyer. '
Senator Burton took the stand to-day, in
"his own defense. Instead of excusing
him Immediately upon the conclusion of
his direct - testlmany, as \ was j done at \u25a0 his
former trial. District" Attorney Dyer to
day subjected . the Senator to the severest
cross-examination : auring - the ' present
hearing;; } â¢-\u25a0-\u25a0' \u25a0 \u25a0-. '- ; -â --\u25a0 -. '.
The only other witnesses introduced
by the 'defense, { with : exception \u25a0of

corroborated part of : the Senator's testi
mony, and former Judge \u25a0 ; Chester. l H.
Krum, who had charge \u0084of Senator Bur

HC QUESTION OF JURISDICTION.
Senator Burton's testimony in . the be
ginning followed closely that given in the'
former . trial, with the exception that 'in
describing hl3 conversation \with Thomas
B.: Harlan in regard to . what . the lat^
ter. has already, testified. Senator,; Bu
rton laid special stress upon the fact that
before the conversation relating to his
employment by . the Rialto Company was
started the train In which they were en
route from St. Louis to Chicago :.â¢' had
crossed the Mississippi and was In Illi
nois, outside the jurisdiction .of; the court
before which the case is being. tried. : :
Senator Burton testified that during his
conversation with Harlan, who 'was ; ; the
representative of the Rialto Company," he
used the- following words in" connection
with his proposed employment: *..
" 'Now, Mr. Harlan, let . me understand
you. lam a Senator.' â¢Â» This /"company is
using the malls extensively.' 1 . Is. it con
templated^n'Any;_way^hat I am. expected

very emphatic. --' He- said: ( 'No, .Senator;

In referring' ta the "compensation offered I
by the Rialto Company in connection with
his employment as counsel â¢to appear in .
the defense of its president, Major Den
nis, Senator Burton \ said: I;
"I told him that I did j not want to en
ter a casa of that kind as counsel for a
rich firm for a nominal f ee'of J4OO or $500^
and suggested a contract of $500 a month
for five months." '-.: , . \
STRONG DENIAL BY SENATOR.
The eyes of all in. court were fastened
on Burton as 'his counsel ; asked him
whether or not", he remembered the con
versation relative .to his ! employment by
the National Securities Company as re
lated yesterday by. Charles H. Brooks,
witness for. the prosecution. :j â¢
"No," almost shouted Burton, intently
leaning forward as if .to ' emphasize his
answer. .: , ;..;'.: " '/, .'
In rebuttal W. J. "Vlckery and W. E.

that the following -statement â¢/ was not

"I (Senator Burton) cannot be employed

NEWS OF THE COUNTIES ABOUT THE BAY
LIFE IMPRISONMENT FOR
FRUITVALE MURDERER.
Young Blaker Is Sen
tenced by Oakland
Judge.
Trial of His Boy Ab
complices Is Now
in Progress.
OAKLAND. Nov. 24.â T0 spend the re- |
malnder of his life at San Quentin was i
the -sentence imposed this morning by
Judge AlfclYin titl Georgre W. Blaker, a
3&->var-old youlh. for complicity in the
murder of Thomas W. Cook at Frultvale
last July.
A hush fell over the courtroom when
tlie ftr.al words of Judge Melvin an
nounced the term of punishment, but
ihrre was no bcÂ«?:ios Within the rail sat (
Captain Charles Blukcr.nhe lad's father. ,
Â«n<l he Pl<le him his daughter, Mrs. Jen- i
nic Gotte. The face of the father was
trar sta'.ncd, the result of an interview
bÂ« fore tho court srene, but his emotions
wÂ« re controlled, and the audience that
had filled the courtroom with life and
noire before the sentence had been pro
nounced left the room quietly.
FIRST TO BE SENTENCED.
BlaUcr is the first of the three youths
charged with the murder of Cook to feel
the heavy hand of the law. Waiting in
another department was Percy Pembroke,
and as soon as District Attorney Allen
fcad hoard the sentence imposed on
Blafcer he went into Department 1 and
took up the trial of Pembroke, which is
now under way. Blaker was also
brougrht into the ttial of the case, and
it Is stated will take the stand and tell
the story of the crime.
John Schneider was there also, and the
three youths, not one of whom has yet
reached his eighteenth year, were con
fronted with each other and with the
crime, for the commission of which two
have yet to be tried. Schneider took the
stand and told practically the same story
he had told on the stand at Blaker' s
triaL He admits having been with the
others, but says that he ran when the
others attacked their victim.
PEMBROKE'S CONFESSION.
Â« In a confession made before the trial
Pembroke told Sheriff Barnet that he
was the one who ran, and a witness who
partially corroborates Pembroke's state
ment took the stand to-day in the per
son of Mrs. Amanda Blackson, who was
In a ter.t not far from the scene of the
crime, and out of her window saw one
of the three youths who came running
by close to her. She says that whoever
It was wore light clothes and a black
hat. Schneider says that he was the
cne who ran away, but also admits that
he lost his cap near where Cook was at-r
tacked, and was therefore bareheaded
\u25a0when he went by Mrs. Blackson.
From the cross examination of Schnei
der to-day by Attorney Lin Church it is
evident that he is going to make the
most of this point and .will endeavor to
show that his client was the one who
ran away, and was therefore not Impli
cated in the actual striking down of the
defenseless Cook and the taking of his
money. At adjournment this evening the
case went over until next week.
PASSENGER STEAMER
STKIKES ON SHOAL
Persons Aboard the Wrecked
Vessel Are Rescued by
Life Savers.
HOLLAND. Mich.. Nov. 24.â The pas
ecnger steamer Argo, the Graham & Mor
gan line vessel, which left Chicago last
night for this city, struck a shoal early
this morning trying to make the harbor
during a 50-mlle gale and was smashed
against the north pier. Helpless and
partly wrecked, the steamer with its load
of passengers was tossed about by the
tremendous sea, finally stranding 500 feet
from Bhore. Twenty-five passengers and
thirteen of the crew were rescued by the
heroism of Robert Smith, a member of
the life-saving crew, who was pulled
throusrh the waves to the steamer by a
lifeline and succeeded in rigging a
breeches buoy. Captain John Stewart and
a few picked members of the craw refused
to desert the ship and to-nieht they are
ptill on board, although the breeches buoy
Is being kept in readiness In case the ves
sel should show signs of going to pieces.
During the day the Argo was gradually
driven northward along the beach and to
night lies ISOO feet north of the pier and
within 200 feet of the shore.
The ArÃo is a steel vessel, 173 feet long,
valued at $40,000. It will probably cost
125.000 to $30,000 to refloat and repair her.

BALL'S SCALP
IS DEMANDED
Prominent^ Merchants Say
Fire Chief ; Is Not Compe
tent to Hold His Pqsition
CHAKGES .^RE GRAVE
Allegations of Neglect of
Duty Are Denied \yy
Head of the Department
OAKLAND. . Nov. - 24. â Charges of in
competence | were riled* against Chief
Engineer N. A. Ball, of the Oakland Fire
Department this morning-, in a 1a 1 petition
tiled with the Board of Police and ' Fire
Commissioners : by Frank Mathews,
president of the r Ãay City Iron Works,'
in which^the signers, of the: document,
fifty-three in number," ask that; the
Chief be. remove<JÂ«from his position," oh
the ..ground \^S\' inefficiency in j^the
handling of the recent fire in the" manu
facturing- district at Third and Clay
streets. â¢ V â¢
.In his reply t(r the charges, Chief
Ball," who .has always been rated as
a thoroughly competent officer, declares
that. the. allegations .are- absolutely
false/ and are either the resul t of mis
information, .or are caused by. personal
or political animosity.:. ,-'" ..
The ; Chief says - that, so far as the
charges themselves are concerned, he
will have no difficulty in : disproving all
of them, and that' he courts a full in
vestigation by the Commissioners.
The petition, which, Chief: Ball says,
was circulated at- the instance of Presi
dent 1 Mathews of ; the Bay City Iron
Works, which w^re badly damaged in
the fire referred/ to, ".[ charges, "among
other things/that Chief Ball did not
turn in a' general alarm on his arrival
at the fire, and that he took .time \to
carefullyremoVe his coat and vest, -and
fold them on the seat of his buggy be
fore turning In a second alarm. !
. CHARGES ARE GRAVE.
The Chief is also charged .with
having refused to allow the firemen to
turn a stream of water -on the.Burn
ham Standef ord-Company's mill, on the
south side of Second street, and that
employes of the mill forcibly took- "a
line of hose from the firemen, and used
it to extinguish - the lire which had
spread to the lumber piled in front of
the company's mill on S*econd street.
Charges are also made that when '-a
representative of the Burnham-Stande
ford Company asked for assistunce to
prevent the spread of the flames, Chief
Ball was abusive and profane in his
refusal.
The'records of the Fire Department
show that n general alarm was turned
in from box 65 on the day of . the fire
which destroyed the buildings In the
block-bounded by Second' and Third
and Washington^and Qlay. streets," and
that seven of the eight.'engines of the
city : were used on that date in fighting
the fire. In response to the charge ,that
he lost time in sending^ in^a'; second
and third alarm' Chie- Ball says he can
prove that the secoridalarrh was' turned
in the. moment he: reachedHhe' fire,; and
the third as soon'; as-/ the \u25a0 second
had ceased 'to sound. -Regarding the
charge 111 1 hat he took .time to carefully
remove and fold his coat and vest,. the
Chief says that a dozen people can
it; false. \u25a0 , . \u25a0;< '\u25a0*;'
*- The charge is also made that the
hose couplings on the battery ,of â¢ the
Fifteenth street hose wagon, called in
the petition" the/ water tower, 'were
missing, and that a messenger had to
be sent to the engine house to get them
before the battery- could put- into
action.' This charge proves itself false,
for the couplirtgs of the battery>are / a
part of the apparatus, and to remove
and replace them would take an hour's
work by the machinist. /,
CHIEF KEELS CONFIDENT.
* Chief Ball said to-day that ran officer
in the San 'Francisco'; Fire Department
present at the. fire in question made an
observation /as to* the .'number of
engines which would" have been used
to -subdue "a blaze of the same magni
tude in San Francisco,, and
upon the excellent' work ..done by the
local 'department in. 'preventing;: the
spread of the fire from the block in
which . it originated. .The Chief also
says that it can:be:'provedib'y^disinter
ested' persons that the entire center; of
the block was in the grip of the flames
before the alarm, was. turned in. Â»\u25a0â¢;:
Among the signers' of the petition
for the 'removal of Chief Ball is W. J.
Emrlck, who some time â¢'."\u25a0 ago; was
awarded a contract for ;, repairing one
of the city's fire engines. ..When the

On the minute bock of the State Harbor
Ouramixsien Is a blank page left vacant for
the copying- thereca of a letter from the South
ern Pacific Railroad Company. The new A!a
neda mole and d<"s>ot were threatened a few
\u25a0weeks ago with destruction by fire. Flames
cesiroyed the old depot and mole. After long
delay the construction of a new mole and de
pot was becun and after months of most de
liberate work the new structure was completed.
In spite of the fact that the old -mole and
the buildings thereon, as well as much valu
able rolling stock, were destroyed by lire, the
railroad engineers who did the rebuilding over
looked the matter of fire fighting equipment
and en the new mole one' little faucet supplies
til thÂ« available water. The only other liquid
in the vicinity of the depot Is fuel oil. two big
tanks of which stand a fathom or two from
i!.e biy wooden structure. When the mole took
fire a few weeks ago the first effective stream
of water poured on the blaze was from the
nozzle of one of the State fire tuffs, which
had crossed frcrn this s!de of thÂ« bay at first
eiblt cf the etneke and flarae*. In the course
of time the railroad company brought from
Oakland an engine which pumped water on the
fiames, but if It had not been for the prompt
ei-pearance en the ecene of the Stal* fire tug
the new Alameda mole would have chared the
fate of its predecessor. The blank page on the

SATGENT'S WIFE
GROWS ANXIOUS
Detectives Ryan and ODea intended to
have preferred several .charges of srand
larceny yesterday against Francis T.
Sargent, the Point Richmond jeweler.. but
concluded to wait till to-day in the hope
that new developments might arise. They i
are inclined now to doubt that Sargent j
had an accomplice. Sargent told them;
that he knew his accomplice -as . "Joe.''
Hethought his other name was, Dorsch.
but was not quite : sure. 7 "Joe", he . said ;
used to work at ;Pinole and -was noted j
for his red hair.* -He; met him accidental- j
ly and "Joe" at once fell in with the
proposition.
: Sargent's wife and his stepson /called
at. the City; Prison yesterday afternoon.
She promised the 'prisoner that she would
employ an . attorney to look j after his in
terests. It was her first visit to the
prison i since her husband's arrest, and
the detectives say that it was prompted
by , the statements In yesterday % morn
ing's papers that 'she might be arrested
as . an . accomplice. The .detectives say
that none of the " wholesale jewlers and
others who were victimized by\Sargeht
will agree to prosecute" Mrs. Sargent on
theÂ»uncorroborated statement of her hus
biÂ»id. Besides, any action would have to
be taken against ' her in Contra Costa
County. \u25a0
Sargent told Ryan and ODea that he
was sure there would be a rupture soon
between him and' his wife, and that was
why - he' was taking some of the stolen
jewelry out of the store and hiding it
so that â¢ when he and \ his wife separated
he would have something to fall back
upon. He toldthem that his wife knew
about' his stealings all the time and en
couraged him ' to . go ahead.

THE MINERS' CONVENTION.
has a larger variety of great and profitable m
( dustries than any other part of the world. Most of them are
organized, but none, is better "organized than, mining. . The
Miners' Association was later in formation than many others, but it
has -made that up by its compactness and energy. It came into be
ing as a protest against the opinion that gold production in this
State was no longer an industry worthy of investment and enter
prise. Gold mining was being overshadowed by other of the great
. productions of California. Many causes contributed to its decline.
The lack of means of getting the power needed in the working of
mines caused many camps to be deserted. Others were obsoletcd
for lack of cheaper processes for the working of low grade ores, or
for the reduction of ores that were refractory. The State was with
out a school of mines. It had no metallurgical center in which base
ores could be profitably smelted. The industry was not only un
organized, it was demoralized.
Upon this scene of chaotic decay appeared the Miners' Associa
tion, headed by strong and skilled miners who were confident that
the State's mineral resources were only slightly developed, and that
mining, reinforced by art and science, could be made a business as
certain in its results as manufacturing. The results have justified
this confidence. While many men and -much capital have been di
verted by the more gaudy prospects of Alaska and the bonanza dis
coveries in Nevada, mining for gold in California has steadily ad
vanced. Not only has it been stimulated, but the genius and experi
ence of the organized industry have gone into the mining of other
metals and minerals, until the total value of the State's output of
metals and minerals has risen to $44,000,000 a year, of which gold
supplies $19,000,000.
This has come about in the face of strong negative and affirm
ative opposition to many things necessary to successful mining.
Other policies, good and necessary in themselves, have been for a.
long time so administered as to hamper the miners. The national
parks and forest reservations of the State made the use of wood
for fuel to raise power impossible. The means of transportation to
the mines were cut off by denial of right of way for wagon or electric
roads. Electric power could not be substituted for steam because
the streams that could produce it by hydraulic energy without deple
tion or other injury to their waters were within the Government
reservations, and permission to use water power, even when the
stream was in private riparian ownership, was refused by the Gov
ernment. The right of way for wires to carry electric power over
the great reservations was refused at \\ r ashington on the ground
that the poles and wires marred the scenery of landscapes that no
one ever journeyed to see. The mineral prospector and the agri
cultural pre-emptor and timber land buyer were not given equal
treatment and equality of rights.
Against this sea of troubles the Miners' Association took up
?.rms and has so far overcome it that mining in California is on a
better basis than ever, though much remains to be done for it. Under
the circumstances is it any wonder that the miners have demanded
and still demand that their industry shall have in the Cabinet of the
President, a Department of Mines, as the farmers have a Depart
ment of Agriculture? *,v*vy
Now they have to appeal to the Interior Department or to some
other, that is void of sympathy for them and lacking in knowledge
of their needs. As a rule when they so appeal they strike the offi
cial opinion that a miner is a bad man, that he is destructive of
everything he touches, and that it is best that he be kept out every
where that his access can be prevented*. Yet the United States is*
the greatest mining country in , the world. Its metals and minerals'
are the most widely distributed, and more people live by their pro
duction than in any other country. Stop mining of all kinds by un
friendly legislation or executive indifference and the progress of the
country would stop.
As an example of the effect of mining upon the rise and progress
of a country, witness the views of the more intelligent and progres
sive Chinese in China. There the Government has not only frowned
upon mining but has prohibited it. It is the opinion of Chinese who
know the world, and have clear conception of the origin of the wealth
of nations, that the modernizing of China and the uplifting of her
people to a higher plane of earning and living must, begin with the
opening of her mines of gold, silver, copper and coal.
The Miners' Association, feeling thoroughly the energy of or
ganization, has met at one of the State's oldest mining centers, in
Nevada County, where were dug out of the ground fortunes that
have gone into the trade and upbuilding of San Francisco, fts
convention has been the guest of the mountain miners who work
ledges that have been steady- dividend payers for a quarter of a
century. Business has been ! relieved by the hospitality of a real
highland welcome. The policy of the association will be strongly
uttered and its demands will embody the hopes of the miners of < the'
United States, and should receive the respectful attention of the
Government.
ROCKEFELLER. TO TESTIFY. .
IT must be the cause of much mortification â¢ to Mr. Rockefeller
that one of his former managers swears that false gauging was
one of the means used to break down competitors of the Stand
ard Oil Trust, when underselling did not accomplish their exter
mination. Mr. Rockefeller is a "professor," as good old ladies used
to call an, earnest church member, and if he is as familiar with'jhis
Bible as a "professor" should be he will remember that it has a
great deal to say about the fate of those who use false weights and
false measures. It is strongly intimated in that book that such men
go to hell, and what happens to them there is pictured by Dante
and Milton, and was stated by Jonathan Edwards in.his sermon oh
4< The Judgment," which drove into hysterics old ladies who' had
done no worse than put an infrequent addled egg into -the lot that
went to market.
According to the orthodox standard Mr.^Rockefeller, will get
fnto a hammam bath of brimstone that will open his pores unless
he can prove that his employes and underlings have been led on and
instigated by the devil and not by himself, to the use of false gauges
in the oil business. He. is to testify in the same case in the court at
St. Louis, and we really hope that he will be able to flee from the
wrath to come, under oath. -Vj ;
Lawson and Miss Tarbell have worked him. out as a magazine
sensation, and he has been th,e subject of much picturesque abuse,
some of it, let us hope, undeserved. But none of his critics got on
to this false gauge business. It comes just at the turn of the tide.
It is always possible to popularize an unpopular" man by abusing
him, and Mr. Rockefeller seemed to be just emerging from the pile
of missiles thrown at him, and, resplendent in a new,, wig," .was about
to qualify himself for a place in the Hall of Fame, wHen he is struck
by this false gauge. . The. country will listen to his testimony', with
keen interest. MSB '.V . "'"

TO BUY LAND
Supervisors Solicit Offers for
the Property as a Site for
the Lowell High School
PLAYGROUNDS SELECTED
Home Telephone Company
Renews Petition for Early
Hearing on a, -Franchise
The Supervisors' Joint committee on
finance and public utilities yesterday
considered the selection of several sites
offered fur the proposed Lowell High
School building to be built under the bond
Issue. The sites offered include the Bell
property on Octavia street, between
Bush and Sutter; a half-square block
on Hayes street, between Steiner and
A'UTce. opposite Alamo Square; a half
"yei are block on Laguna street, between
Turk and Eddy; opposite Jefferson
BQiiarc; a lot at the northwest corner of
Pest and Vaa Ness avenue; another at
the southeast corner of Sutter and Gough
iiiid a block bounded by Hayes, Fell,
Baker and Lyon.
President Roncovicri of the Board of
Education said a let Tib by 275 feet would
be ample for the purpose, as the building
would be 200 by 150 feet. He took occa
sion to criticize a. statement made l>y
Principal Morton of the Lowell High
Bchool that a lot 175 feet square would be
Eutncient, saying "Morton did not know
what he was talking about."
The committee rather favored the Bell
Eite. but as the lot offered for $176,500 is
cot cf sufficient *ize it was decided to
have A. M. Speck submit offers for three
parcels, including one of 275 by 275 feet,
275 by 250 feet and 275 by 212& feet in the
' block on Octavia street between Sutter
&ud Bush.
WAJVTS BOARD TO ACT.
. J. G. North, attorney for the Home
Telephone Company, appeared before the
bupervisors' public utilities committee
yesterday and urged that the petition of
the company fcr the sale of a telephone
franchise be taken up at once. North ex
plained that the time for the present
board to act on the franchise is short,
In view cf the fact that it will \u25a0 retire
from office next January. Supervisor
Boxton stated that a meeting had been
called for next Friday to consider the
franchise and objected to taking it up
,Vi;mediately. Supervisor Connor suggest-
Af^! that North present his statement next
CTld&y. D'Ancona said the company is
t va:;. d to the earliest possible hearing
In order that the board could take action
EfSrmative or negative before its term
expires. Connor said the other side should
be heard and the Pacific States Company
be given an opportunity to present its
case. The committee figured that if the
iranchise was acted upon favorably next
Monday b!ds couid be received by Jan
uary & if (subsequent action is expeditious.
North held that the reception of bids is
purely ministerial and if this board or
dered the franchise Bold the incoming
board would be compelled to invite bids.
North disagreed with Brandenstein that
the board would have the right to reject
any cr all bids, claiming that under the
Broughton act the highest bid would
have to be accepted. It was finally de
cided to confer with Chairman Braun
hart. who is ill, and if he will call a
meeting before next Friday, the day orig
inally set, the committee will consider
the petition.
OFFERS ARE ACCGPTED.
The committee accepted the offer of
owners to 6ell lots adjoining the Whittier
fcchool, on Harrison Btreet, for 57050.
The offers of owners to sell land on
Seventh street between Bryant and Har
rison streets as a site for a children's
jjlaygrouad were accepted.
The offer to sell to the city for ,$60,000
two fifty-vara lots in block 177, the cite
selected for a children's playground at
North Beach, was denied and the owner
\u25a0was offered Jt-0.000 for the property or
condemnation proceedings will be in
stituted.
A number of offers of laxid for the Park
rt':d Presidio and Park extension were ac-
pied, as tbe prices are within the ap
j>raistd values.

Many Tournaments Are Up
for Decision During the
Thanksgiving Holidays
WRIGHT WILL -BE GUEST
American Champion Tennis
Player to Be Entertained
at an Elaborate Banquet
Several tennis tournaments Trill be
played on the courts during the next
few daye. Each of the clubs will hold
a Thanksgiving day tourney. The
finals of the Clareraont event will also
be played neit Thursday. . Besides t he.-;-i
tournaments the Golden Gate and ths
California clubs have- events to finish.
Both stitYted a tournament last Sunday
â¢and as much as possible of them will
be completed to-morrow.
The Thanksgiving" day tournament of
the Golden Gate Club will be started
to-day. It will be a mixed doubles
event in which all of the experts of
the public courts will participate. The
final rounds will be played next Thurs
day. It will -probably be the most in
cresting mixed doubles event . ever
played in 'his city. Besides the clever
young ladle* of the park. Miss Hazel
Hoichkiss, State champion, "and Miss
Ethel Ratcliffe. formerly holder of the
same title, will compete.
Miss Hotclikiss will have for a part
ner Clarence Griffin, one of the cleverest
young- players in this part of tho Stale.
Miss Ratcliffe will also have a strong
partner. She will play with Charles
Dunlap. The latter is a clever doubles
player and with Miss Ratcliffe will
make about as strong a* combination
a* Miss Hotchkiss. and Griffin.
Coast Champion Janes will have as
partner Miss Golda Meyer, the most
promising player in the city. They will
make an excellent team, but could
hardly be expected to beat the two
teams just mentioned.
Other strong teams that have already
entered are Miss Vera Crocker and
George Â» Baker, Miss Ida Mearns and
Charles Foley, Miss A. Greenberg and
Guy Lytton and Miss A. Vodden and R.
X. Whitney. The drawing will be held
this afternoon.
Tlie class singles tournament com
menced in the California Club courts
last Sunday will be completed to-mor
row. The third class will probably be
reopened and several players allowed
to enter. The event was arranged in
too great a hurry to have a large entry
Hst.
In the first class H. Schmidt, the cup
holder, defaulted to M. Long in the pre
liminary round. In the first round
Long met H. Gabriel, but the match
was not completed. Long won the first
set 6-2 and led at 2-0 in the second.
H. Long and G. Busch will meet in
the preliminary round, the winner will
then play George Janes. M. Long and
Janes will probably come together in
tlie finals.
In ihe second class Kenyon and Mills
will come together In the preliminary
round and the winner will play G.
Fuller. Dr. Lovegrove and Cutter will
meet in the first round.
In the fourth class Blaisdell beat
Krskine in the first round and is in the
linals. Murphy and Dr. Noble will come
together in the preliminary round and
the winner will jjlay Webster.
The handicap doubles tournament set
for last Sunday will be played to-mor
row on the park courts. The entry
list is comparatively small, but the
handicaps are large and the matches
should be close.
The Thanksgiving day tournament at
the California Club will be a scratch
doubles tournament. First and fourth
class players will draw fp r partners as
will second and third.
The finals of the Claremont Country
Club scratch doubles tournament will
bring together two clever teams. They
are the Baker brothers and H. Schmidt
and H. Rolfe. The match will be played
next Thursday afternoon at 2:30
o'clock.

BIRDS SCATTER
BEFORE STORM
Sportsmen Expect Good Duck
and Quail Shooting on
the Preserves To-Morro w
What is pronounced the greatest
flight Of ducks ever seen on the fa
mous Suisun marsh was that stirred
up by Thursday's storm. Unfortunately,
for the clubmen owning preserves
there it came on an off day. the mid
week shooting being limited /. to
Wednesday by common consent.' , *^'"Â»,v
The storm demonstrated to the sat
isfaction of the sportsmen that the
ducks are here In countless thousands
and that all that is reauired is suit
able weather to make the shooting, of
the highest class. The - prospects are
considered excellent for sport to-mor
row. \u25a0 '
The rain' has also brought joy to the
men who enjoy a day on the upland
after quail. These; great game birds
will now come out of the heavy brush
into the open, where they \u25a0will test .the
skill of the gunmen by their ", ..rapid
flight. .'./ ; - \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0'-.
There will be unusually heavy tides
on the* bay to-day,' . to-morrow - and
Monday. This water will get over the
low levees and will form much needed
ponds on some of the preserves. *
The preserve of' -the Empire Gun
Club In Monterey pounty is affording
excellent sport." "Last Sunday 170
ducks were bagged by < five members
on one slough. Floyd S. Judah was
one of the fortunate ones to secure, the
limit allowed by, law. , J. B. Haver di
vided .his time between the ducks and
the quail, securing twenty-three of the
former and twenty-two. of the latter.

As shown by the foregoing table, the
defense of the Oakland Hornets and
of the Independents is strong, only ono
goal having been scored again3t the
Litter and none against the former. In
attack, however, the Independents are
stronger than the Hornets, the former
having* put the ball into their op
ponents' net eighteen times and the
latter having pierced It only nine times.
The defense of the Vampires has al
ways been excellent, and has been fur
ther strengthened by the addition of
Schmitt, who played on a good Swiss
team.~-|Ja!2fÂ§sEsgfe
Three of the eight teams, viz.: San
Francisco. Sacramento and Santa Cruz.
: have not scored a point, but each of
them includes some good players.
Kraoskopf. a native of Ontario*'' Can
ada, and a lacrosse player, is one of thÂ»
â¢active spirits of the San Francisco
team, which is made up principally of
jnen who played last season for the
Pickwicks.. Macartney, center 'forward
and captain of the Sacramento eleven,
and Gillchrest. fullback, were enrolled
last season with the Hornets. Both are
stronsr playera. as Is also Morgran. On
the opening: day of the season the Sac
ramento team met the Independents,
and on "the 12th inst. they played
against the Albion Rovers, and, these
being two of the strongest teams in
the league, the visitors naturally suf
fered defeat. On the 19th they had no
match, but will " doubtless make mat
ters Interesting' for the Eagles at Aln
meda to-morrow. The Santa Cruz team
has two good fullbacks in Owens and
McNamara, while Richardson at half-"*
back and Jenkins and Duvies In the*
forward line play well.
On Thanksgiving day of last year
three friendly matches were played â
two at Freeman's Park and one at Ala

Writing In the Illustrated Outdoor
News of tbe association football match
played between the English Pilgrims
nnd a New tforlc eleven. C. Q. Turner
says:
The new football Is tke real football; sMft.
clean, exhilarating and scientific. Though the
play was ceaseless and intense for an hour
and a half, not one of the players retired, and
only twice, for the fragment of | a mlnu t â¢. I was
the same delayed, while a player on each side
rubbed ,a. sltehtly strained knee- or muscle.
Nor was this a singular experience-; the vlsttln^
> team has only one extra man. who has never
through all their . matches, been called upon
and In no single case has any member of thÂ»
somewhat raw teams they have met, been put"
out of commission. Â»Tet no one can say that
the came Is not strenuous; not for a single

MARVELOUS SKILL OF BOXERS
Mike (Twin) Sullivan of Boston clever
ly outpointed Jimmy Gardner, a neigh
bor of his In the Bay State, in their
twenty-round fight before the Hayes
.Valley Club last night at Woodward's
Pavilion. In every department of the
\u25a0boxing game, except In the ability to hit
fcard, Sullivan had a decided lead, over
>.is opponent. He did the major part of
the leading, proved the cleverer \ hitter j
rfr.A easily scored the most points. When i
' fcfea fight was over, Gardner was between j
p.cferee Welch and Sullivan, and the of- I
f.cial was seen to shake his head as he I
Sind to make his way around Gardner to
;vrhere Builivan was standing- to declare
khe latter the winner. - ',
The fight was remarkable for the clev- i
erness shown by both boxers In block
ing. Their arms and gloves went -up in
etinctively to ward off blows which would I
have done terrible execution had they
Janfled. Sullivan put up a steady, ag-
ETeeslvÂ© fight from 6tart to finish, while
Gardner displayed his aggressiveness
only in flashes. Each tlm* he turned
aoose, however, he punished Sullivan se
verely. Â«
SulllT&n baa a very open style, which
j^ves him the appearano* of being eaey
ao bit, but this seemed deceptive, as
many of Gardner's blo^rs fell short . or
Â«lsÂ« went wl<sa of their mark. Gardner
developed, a wholesome reepect for Sulli
van's choppy blows with tight and left
fearlr In thÂ© fight. In the third round
jhe commenced to complain about Sulll
â¢van hitting In the clinches, but later on
ih* was the chief offender in any rough
-fc-ork that was used. There were but few
periods during the eonteÃt In which Sul
livan held on, and then only for brief
epcllÃ. Gardner showed an Inclination to
do this at different stages of the fight,
but It did him little good, as whenever
6ullivan found him in that position he
juppercut him hard.
BETTCirO ODDS FAI^SE.
The outcome of tbe fight shows how
;&ise were the betting odds. At one time
Gardner ruled a 4 to 10 choice, but these
odds were forced up by the admirers of
Sullivan till at one stage of the betting
/t was 8 to 10. Gardner's admirers also
fhowed an Inclination to bet that he
would win inside of fifteen rounds. Both
t.oxers were badly cut up in the face.
Gardner's nose was puffed up to unusual
proportions and he was also badly cut
on the top of the head during a. sharp
encounter In the twelfth round. The
blood ran down in a stream over his left
ear. giving the impression that that or
gan had been badly damaged. Sulli
van's nose began to bleed in the fifth
round, and Gardner kept peppering it for
the remainder of the fight. For the last;
Three rounds Gardner cast all his boxing
FkiU to the winds and seemed" intent on
landing a big rich swing to his oppo
nent's jaw. Sullivan maintained his cool
ness under the heaviest fire and used his
feet effectively. He Jabbed Gardner re
jKatedly, sending the head of the. Lowell
baser back with a f=nap.
When the men were sent together In
the first round, Sullivan went right after
and bustled him about the ring.
Hardner was the first to score, however,
n i:h a right to the body. Sullivan came
hack with another, but with no force.
rc-ar the end of the round Sullivan
forced GaTdner to the ropes and landed
right and left, Gardner covering up. and
f.rotecting himself. Just before the bell
Gardner tried with right and left to the
law, but missed both of them. Sullivan
\u25baid most Â«f the work In the second round,
cppr.lng proceedings with a left to the
head and landing a right to the body in
t sharp mixup in the center of the ring.
Pullivan mlesed a hard right to the body
tncJ got a left in return. Gardner tried a
right to the head, but failed to connect
tnd Sullivan landed two hard right upper
tuts to the body.
BOTH MEX BUSY. -
Both landed lefts to the body and Sul
livan was forcing Gardner as the rounds
tlosed. Sullivan did all the fighting in
the third round. Gardner missed two
leads for the body and blocked a 'hard
right and left from Sullivan. Sullivan
rushed Gardner and drove him into his
rwn corner. Sullivan got In at- close
l-ange and punished his man severely.
trhey exchanged lefts to the heaS^and
then Sullivan landed on head and body
repeatedly. Sullivan sent a straight to
the head after Gardner fell short with
cue sâ¬ his leads. Gardner had not awak
ened to the fact that he was in a fight in
the fourth round and he -was still taking
ha&tters easy. Sullivan sent a left to the
Jiead and tried again with his left, but It
was blocked.
Sullivan sent a hard left to the face
ftr.d followed with a right uppercut. He
then popped In three rights to the jaw
" without a return. He rushed Gardner to
the ropes and hit him at will on head

G.\nil.M-:it PLUGS HARD.
Gardner pepped In a hard right to.the'
loft as they were breaking out of a clinch.
Sullivan went after him and landed,
rlsrht and left to the head, while Gard
ner countered hard with a right to the
body. Near the close of the round 1 Gard
ner was fighting like a wild man, but he
was not effective. They had barely come
together in the seventh round when Gard
ner went down to the mat, partly from
8 hard Irf t to the head and partly from
the fact that he was overbalanced at the
time. Gardner was fighting desperately
as socn as he reached his feet. He sent
a rifrht to the head which landed back
of Sullivan's ear and seemed to daze him
for a moment. Gardner tried to follqw
up bis advantage, but Sullivan came back
fighting and sent in a right to the head
that Just landed on its ; intended mark.
There was r.o damage done in the eighth
round, but Sullivan forced Gardner 'to
clinch repeatedly. Gardner missed two
terrific right swings which went'whist
ling through the air and which would
have done terrible execution .had they
landed. Near the end of the. round there
was considerable. infighting and Gardner
Bent one left to the body which hurt Sul
livan. Sullivan did all the' forcing In - the
[ ninth round, the spectators hissing Gard-
X2*r for his clinch! ne tactics. This - was
Sullivan's round all the way. The .tenth
was the most exciting round -up to this
point. The men 6tood up within , short
range and Just slugged, each hoping
land a decisive blow. '
When tte gong sounded the opening of 1
the eleventh round Gardner rushed across
the ring and met Sullivan before. the lat
ter was fairly .out. of = his L corner. V, He
landed a terrlflo left to the body, which
hurt Sullivan noticeably. . The latter, came
back fighting, * however, . and nearly,, put
Gardner down. with,. a* right to Jhe head.
Gardner's face looked terribly drawn ; arid
showed the great strain under which '-he
was laboring.' Gardner sent" a right to
the body and got a; right upper cut which
did him no" good. \ ; \u25a0 ". '\"
SULLIVAN HITS ZVOSE.
In the twelfth round Sullivan contented
himself for some time "with peppering
Gardner's puffed nose with his ; left. Near
the end of the --round; Sullivan ;beat nis
opponent badly, .at one time forcing him
outside the upper rope of the ring. The
thirteenth was Gardner's- round, as he
had Sullivan groggy after, falling short on
a wild swing. Sullivan . was bleeding
badly at nose 'and mouth and It seemed
ho could not suivlve the fusillade of bto^s
Gardner rained^ojt him.: Gardner meas
ured his man carefully and landed three
hard rights to' the. head, Without a
turn. Sullivan hung* on and Gardner
forced him on the ropes, in" an. effort to
get a straight punch at /Jils' ja\r. It
seemed Sullivan could, hardly stay the
round out, but the bell saveta him. Gard
ner foolishly rested In thene'st round and
gave Sullivan a much need^. chance to
recuperate. This was .his" worst part of
the tight, as he improved ' steadily jafter
that
The men fought all o.ver the ring in the
fifteenth round, but neither seemed able
to reach the .vital' spot. '"Gardner seemed
Intent on finishing Sullivan again in the
sixteenth round, but his efforts proved
futile. He" missed' one "right, then landed
a right and left, but Sullivan', was too
firm on his feet to go down. Gardner
then tried Xor | the ' body; but while ehe
hurt Sullivan he could' not bring "him
down. Sullivan then turned on Gardner
and Jabbed him often to the head,^wind
ing up the round by sending his left. to
the jaw three times withduf a return.
Gardner tried many times. for a. right to
the head in the seventeenth round,, while
Sullivan contented himself, with Jabbing
Gardner's nope. Gardner used his elbow
on Sullivan In the eighteenth round and
was hissed for his foul tactics. This was
Sullivan's re and by a big margin. -He
shot in one right to the jaw near the
end of the round, which just missed its
mark, and then he : resumed his jabbing

was between Fred Gordon and Young

special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL V BUREAU "' POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, Nov. 24. â Radical
changes .in ; the immigration '". law* of -the
United \ States . will be made during â¢ next
year ~- if the ; suggestions of Commissioner
General of Immigration Sargent . are put
into i effect. - - The ; report of J the Commis
sioner General ; lg # : now,, nearly completed.
It can be said on good authority, that Sar
gent |ia anxious Ito j have ; the -ports' of the
United States closed to certain classes of
foreigners who are allowed^to land under,
the present laws. His idea of .needed re-^
strictions Is that â¢ limits should be placed
on immigrants, . and persons ' who are
either.'too young or too old; to support
themselves should : not \u25a0be t permitted Â» to
disembark.- 1 . This | applies, however, jj only
to -people- who have no prospect of being
properly cared for after their arrival
here and not to those jean furnish
guarantees that they are on their way to
relatives who will look .alter their wel-
fare.
Sargent is also' desirous that the United
States "take the 'initiative"; in: calling a
conference of the officials of the countries
from which immigration is directed here
to provide a : form of legislation agree
able to all governments ; . which will pre
vent persons . not qualified to enter the
United \u25a0 States .: from embarking on -the
ocean journey only to be refused admit
tance rafter their arrival. '. In the; past
year no less than 11,000 immigrants were
deported from the United States because
of their unntness to land here as provided
by the laws. â¢ ,
Sargent \ believes that by an arrange
ment with foreign governments this use
less; trafllCi could \u25a0be . stopped. \u25a0 Before an
immigrant *la permitted to take passage
on an- ocean liner bound for America jhe
should | undergo an examination at . the
point of embarking, according to Sargent's
plan, and-?lf found unqualified^to land
here should be ' restrained from making
the long journey. Sargerit' thinks 'that it
is unfair to immigrants themselves to
permit them to make the trans-oceanic
.trip only to be refused admittance here.

TRADE OUTLOOK
IS ENCOURAGING
Holiday Orders Are Stead
ily" increasing and the
Situation Is Satisfactory
ML MAEKET STEONG
Money Is Active Throughout
Country and Mercantile
Collections Are Improving
NEW YOKK. Nov. 24.â Dun's weekly
review of trade to-morrow will say:
- Fundamental conditions are un
changed, although higher temperatures
at many points again checked retail
sales of, heavy-weight wearing apparel
and other seasonable merchandise. La
bor conditions in the building trades
have not improved, and another serious
struggle may occur, which would be
most unfortunate in View of the largo
operations under way and contem
plated. Otherwise the situation is sat
isfactory and the outlook bright, with
mercantile collections stes^lily improv
ing. Holiday trade gathers impetus aa
the ' season advances. Comparisons
with last year's figures continue favor
able,- this 5 week's gains being swelled
by the holiday a year ago, but equilib
rium in this respect will be restored
next week. Leading industrial under
takings report little idle machinery,
and there is lees -complaint regarding
car shortage.
Hallway earnings thus far available
for November exceed last year's by
6.4 per cent, j Foreign commerce at this
port for the last week showed a loss
of J1, 089,032 .in exports and a gain of
$53,177 in imports, as compared with
the same week last year.
Quiet conditions in the market for
packer hides, chiefly because orders
covered delivered so far Into the future
that Hellers are indifferent regarding
new business.
.Failures . this week numbered 228 in
the United States, against 250 last year,
and 34 in Canada, compared with 39 a
year ago. . .
Bradstreet's to-morrow will say:
Mild, open weather favors in a high
degree the unprecedented activity In
all industrial lines, but unfavorably af
fects retail trade In wearing apparel
and retards collections, which also feel
the adverse influence -of country-wide
freight congestion. Perhaps the most
marked evidence of confidence in th*Â»
future is found in the metal, markets,
which display a strength of demand
and of prices not usual at this season.
Copper is particularly strong, the situ
ation in this market being still further
illustrated by the fact that this week
has seen export trade fall off and actual
imports of Spanish and Chilean bars.
Silver is at the highest price for years.
Export trade in food products does not
expand as hoped for earlier, owing to
large Russian and Argentina shipments.
Prices are steady at close. Money -Is
active the country over. Railway earn
ings show further expansion, the gain
for the*. first half of November being
about 9 per cent. Net returns for nine
months show a gain of 7, per cent.
The wool market is rather quieter.
"Wheat i (including flour) "exports for
the week 'ending: November 28 are
3, 363, 05S : bushels, against 4,720,211 last
week and 1,332,336 this week last year.
From July 1 to date the exports are
44,871,585 bushels, against 25.015.447 last
year and 68.727.795 in 1903.
: Business failures for the week end
ing November 23 number 22 S. against
19S last week and 193Mn the like week
Of 1904.
In Canada failures for the week num
ber 40. as against 41 last week and 41
in. this week a year ago.

; NEW j YORK, Nov. 21.â Tbe activity of
tricÂ«>s tt>-day was ir.ore confused and irregu
iar than is of ten s?Â«>n on the {?:<x-k ExchaTiee.
Ihe action of some stocks bcram** so erratic
c? to un.-cttle sjieculative sentiment and lead
to pentral felling late in the Cay. The mar-
it a result of doubts aroused waÂ« ihrown
|Bto o>cided dullness far a considerable time.
RocfEt ppeculative favorttpg Wtim the centers
of thÂ«Â« movement. The trading rhowed them
un>y imrswre Of th? san-.e cliararter as on
V**.^"*Â» Â»y. . Vigorous FUppcrt ran them up to
fÂ£Mt- t*!aÂ« over last nicht's level, but this
â¢ajj ~ ~'. ,â¢ agraln was followed by constant and
viotent Sictuations, b^th up and down. The
\u25a0BevzxqeÃt in Union' Pacific alyo was calou
.latad to rusxle obserwrs. After yrsterday's
\u25a0ndtal rise this stock was almost Immovable
MntU the gpnersl brÂ«Â»ak at the last, any effort
* to rise a!Â«ivÂ« !c*t nlght'f sevpl meeting such
fcfavy orerir.Ss as io Siive it back. These
cfleriniri;. however, quickly decreased the de
cirhÂ» In the prioe? and evidences of support
lor the ttock devtloped. -TblsWou'd point
to a jroces* of profit-taking on the wide ad
vance of yesterday. ..Then* were 'Jx-sldt* vari
ous rew r-o'nis of Btr^ngth throughout the
â¢ market.' while tome stock* suffered from con
, tlnupd weakness. United States Steel pre
ferred v.as the most prominent substitute for
yesterday's leadership of the market by Union
I^aciflc. Baltimore and. Ohio also erjflyed . a
twnod of strength and there was a current
euppoFition that large speculative accounts
\u25a0were belnr shifted from Reading Into Union
Pacific and Baltimore and Ohio. Amalgamate!
Corp^r had the advantage of apcther ad%-ance
iv the market price of the metal, and in Lon
don there was a pudden rii?e in the price of
- copper fwturee, which a!m<*t cioÂ»Â»d the g*V
Â«xirtlng for some time between the 2>rlce of
futures and spot copiwr .in that market. There
\u25a0were.a xurcber of developments of interest to
*hÂ» Tfiarkpt, but not all of them were reflected
in any consistent, way in tbe action oJ the
\u25a0 market. Uas*uied affairs abroad were re
sponsible for the general decline In. the eariy
dealir.ps. the attitude of Turkey toward the
imvters and the British Ministerial crisis In
. de^icicjr some selling here for foreign account.
Thp g^ripral weakri^^s late in the day seemed
tÂ» I"? due to the suspicion engendered of the
wholesale profit-taking on the part of the large
leaders of the market. The esti
.:.:.:'- of the week's currency movement, based
on sts.ten3Â»>nts from bankers, indicated a gain
in cash by the bask* to be reflected In to
* morrow" g bank statement. There have been
heavy receipts by Â«xpr*Â«s from various poicts
Â»f the interior. Yrjsterday'e transfer to San
Francisco nf $003,000 deposited at the ?Ã¼b
' tr*>2Ft:ry turned the earlier gain by the banks
from that institution into* a loss of several
>ur*dre3 thousand donars, and an additional
<epoÂ»;!t to-dsy of tSOO.OOO for transfer to the
rani*- point promised to increase these figures,
b'J'jt; 1 * receipts by express were estimated to
bÂ«â¢,.:fleient U> afford a net gain of at least
js3.nuO.o(iO. Discounts in London yielded to
below the bank rate to-day and foreign . ex
chanp* here waÂ» weak. Some very large
evjms offend In the call loan market at the
*tock Exchentre were reported to be the prÂ»
â¢ceei:Â» of- sales of finance bills in the ex
â¢ change market by foreign banking houses.
* Reports were circulated of threats of labor
.\roubies on the part of the leaders among the
coal miners but these were subsequently de
nied aod were not of much apparent influence.
The market clored under the influence of a
â¢'rood celling movement, with the tone weak
and prices at the lowest of the day.
\u2666 Bonds were easier. Total sales, par value.

opened weak, initial quotations in May being off

cline.was dvÂ» chiefly to weakness in-.the mar

seemed, to local traders to indicate, that for
eigners did not entertain : serious fears concern
ing ' the Argentine - crop situation, and I conse
quently traders here were inclined to dismiss
the idea that the Argentine crop had been se
verely damaged by frost. "As a result the price
of May declined to 80% @86%c The fact that
rain had last night fallen over the greater por

SPIEL MARKES
NOT BAD COINS
I TTiat a "spiel marke" is not a counter
feit of a United States or of any foreign
coin was the decision rendered yesterday
by United States Commissioner Heacock
in the case of the Government vs. Albert
Collins and John McGowan, accused of
having passed a spiel marke upon Jacob
Butler, a Jewish fruit peddler, last Sun
day afternoon. He accepted it as a twen
ty-dollar piece.
Assistant United States EHetrict At
torney Ben L>. McKlnley argued that as
the piece of gilded x>rass was round,
milled and reeded bore, a fac simile of the
head of the Goddess of Liberty on the
one eifie and tbe eagle with the rays on
the other, it was a counterfeit of a twen
ty-dollar gold piece of the United States.
Bert Schlesinger, who appeared for Col
lins and Harry V..' Storehouse, who rep
resented McGowan; argued that the piece
did not purport to be a coin at all of any
country, but that It did purport to be
\u25a0what It wasâ a' play piece, or a game
counterâ and that it would not deceive
any j>erson of ordinary prudence, \u25a0
Judge Heacock said that the piece ap
peared to him to be of the same status
as a Confederate' note, which had been
decided by Federal courts not to -be a
counterfeit of any Government obllgu-

Under circumstances which strongly
point to suicide the '^body of .Thomas

morning: , In a room' on the third floor
of the Auditorium lodging-house at 117
Turk ' street. Several â¢, bottles were
found , on a bureau in the room, one
of which was -partly filled with perox
ide of hydrosen.V '
A Japanese , servant found the body
stretched on the floor. '\u25a0 Reeves had his
trousers and shoes on. and, an- over
coat covered him. , He; left a note on
which the following: could" be .deciph
ered: ,"Rather'.than"gO;'to' prison I am
going to try andâ -"-The- sentence ended
here and though; it; can only >be sur
mised what he Intended. to state itMs

he had ended his 'own ;life.
The dead, man r had Ã¼ been in this city
about two weeks, | during which time
he lived at this place. ' He drank heav
ily and many who knew: him\ says he
had been ' acting^very \u25a0 strangely of late.
He had a wife living, in this city, but
it is alleged that th'e'yy had. domestic
troubles and had not. been living to
gether for some time. ' \ , : .
Of late friends -had heard him fre
quently utter about going to prison,
but they thought;. he.--; was losing his
reason and. paid: no {attention to him.
It Is said that a few days ago he Is
sued a check on a "commercial bank to
a cigar clerk ;on Market street and
when the holder presented it for pay
ment he was informed, by, the cashier
that Reeves j had \u25a0 no funds ( there. ; That

IN TROUBLE.
Vladimir Buttinsky has Just come
from Russia. Buttinsky had a hard
time of it there. He waa '\u25a0' hot-footed
around the Kremlin by | and
has been : for" months dodging bullets. .
g They, told Buttinsky that there were
no Cossacks In; this country, but,Buttin
sky was "from Mlssourisky.^ He wasn't
taking any chances. -: "When he .set out
down \ Mission street : Thursday I morning
he brought along a- horse pistol .in case
he ran: into an- early; revolution.'
When Policeman Butler saw a \ halrj'
foreigner . with' a revolver jutting out of
.his hip pocket " he naturally thought hÂ«
had an anarchist. Buttinsky was stored
in the j City ; Prison for. safe keeping. -

B. Casson, : a j market * dealer - charged
with having drowned' ducks in his pos
session, was : almost tearful when he ap
peared before Judge Cabaniss yesterday.
. "Mon Dleu,". he exclaimed, . "how can I
tell how the ducks have died? I ; cannot

is enough for me that the ducks are
dead." '. ' \u25a0 \u25a0 ' \u25a0'. : -\u25a0'.â¢\u25a0," .
"But the law says that' you m.ust not

"Mon Dieu, I will have electrocuted
ducks, ; guillotined ducks, any kind of
ducks : that It j is possible to get. I Never
again ! will I sell a , duck until Dr. Baci
galupi j and Dr. Leland have inquired as
to how It has died." .; \u25a0
"That is not necessary," .said Judge
Cabaniss. "A hasty inquest in the mar

ducks and make sure that they have been
shot." â¢\u0084-"â¢".-..- ' .'â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0-. . -',', .- ; y:_.' C-% .':\u25a0\u25a0

HOSPITAL CASE
IS COMPLICATED
V Phillip Murphy, about 35 years . of age,"
concerning whom little \u25a0- is known, died
yesterday, morning: at"< the City and
County of a fractured skuU.
Just r how ;â¢ Murphy received the Injury
that resulted in his death is not known,
and Detective ;Edward Gibson has been
detailed by, the 'police : to> investigate.
Complications rln . the case have arisen
due ! to the fact that the police â¢ were not
told of , the patient's condition when .he
.was .received at the hospital. One of the
internes at the institution says that Mur
phy stated he . had been struck on the
head some time before ' his â¢ death, but
acting > 'Wardeh i McQualde is emphatic in
denying r.that : anything was known even
of i the fractured skull until an autopsy
had been performed. '
The ; hospital ' people assert ' that Mur
phy, was first treated at the Harbor Hos
pital on s November : IS, then' at the Cen
tral Emergency, i after, which he was re
ceived 'by them. \u25a0â¢ He .was in a dazed con
dition and was supposed .to be suffering
from.; some Internal complaint. He grad
.uallycv lost consciousness and expired
about 1 8 ? o'clock yesterday, morning. Be
lieving J the ' case to be one .of natural
causes, the body was turned over to stu
dents, and Dr. Blumer, pathologist of the
University of^' California,* performed â¢an
autopsy. â¢ The; result \was that the'frac
tured - skull -was \u25a0 discovered and the
Morgue officials were notified. ..;
y Dr.] G. C. /Albee/; the .Interne,'- says thai
when v MurpÂ»y ; came - r for > treatment he
told - of ' how ; h* ' had been struck on the
head.':" McQualde denies thla, and the de
tectives * started \ the 'work of , lnvestlga
tion.t" ThÂ« ( inquiry/is somewhat hampered,
as the \u25a0-. ofÃcers^are ' : unable to ascertain
where the man came from and they have
not - the 'benefit of a dying: statement.
.The; people at both? the Harbor Hospital
and^the> Central i Emergency.^ arp positive
'they;: never 1 had j Murphy ; for.: a i patient,
but â¢ McQualde ; is ' equally sure they . had.
â¢To-day the work of tracing hospital rec
ords and of learning something as to the
man's residence and affairs * will be re
sumed.: >_ â¢
