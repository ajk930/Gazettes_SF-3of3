\The drink he took was large enough
to .astonish even a Kansas Democrat.
In refusing the glas3 of water offered
afterward the Missourlan* added to hl3
standing and the Kansas Democracy is
now under his command.
Governor Folk is an inveterate
smoker and his Intimates say he take*
a drink whenever he feels so disposed.
Other members of the party agreed
and the Governor, who may be a Presi
dential possibility, was called to the
smoking-room to settle his standing
with the Kansas Democracy.
"We're about to take a drink." said
Dillard, "and we wondered If you
drank. We've heard so many conflict
ing stories that we thought the best
way would be to ask you."
"Where's the bottler' asked the Mi3
sourian.
Now they know. The discovery was
Incidental to the Dodge City reunion,
which was attended by Governor Folk.
A number of leading Democrats were
gathered in the smoking-room of a car
on the return trip.- when Senator "Joe"
Dolly of Wabaunaea brought up the
oft-discussed subject and turned to
Judge'Dillard for Information.
"I don't know," was the answer. "I
have - heard that he did and heard it
denied. As a good Kansas Democrat.
I would like to know. Suppose wo
send the porter after him and tell him
we want to see him."
This discovery was made by no less
a personage than Judga P. Dillard of

his own observation, it is said. Ever

The examination of these, witnesses
ended the morning session. Brace Is
the only witness left, but it,, is not be
lieved < that he will take the stand in
the light of the confessions of Coombs
and Mulford. , . \u25a0 -
Mulford's testimony differed very lit
tle from that of, Coombs'. In Mulford's
case Coombs acted as a go-between.
Mulfojd was offered and paid $50 â¢ to
make a location and was told by
Coombs that Brace was the man behind.
He admitted that he testified falsely as
to his own claim. He was a member
of a large party which had been taken
to the hills by Coombs as the agent of
Brace. He was out nothing, nor were
any of the rest. Brace paid all the
bills and put up all the. other money
that was necessary. . , ....
Denying nothing. Coombs went upon
the stand and laid the dealings be
tween Brace and himself bare to the
bone. He told briefly how he had been
induced to locate on lands by Brace
The latter put up the Government
price for the land and induced him to
swear falsely as to. the location and in
return paid him the sum of $50. Coombs
was then induced to get others to locate
paying each $50 at the instance of
Brace, who in every case, he said, fur
nished the money and gave Coombs his
Instructions. In every case the entry
man made false affidavits. Deals were
conducted openly, Brace putting up the
money on the day the lands were to be
proved up, often in the Land Office it
self.
The action of Coombs, as well as the
testimony of Mulford. came as a sur
prise to everybody in the courtroom of
United States Commissioner Ford
where the case came up for hearing'
The attorneys for Coombs and Brace, as
well, were completely taken off their
feet. The only calm man in the room
was Special Agent Wade, who in all
probablitiy aad an intimation of what
was coming, for it is the general be
lief that Coombs and Mulford were both
promised immunity by the Government
officials.
: EUREKA. Aug. B.â A sensation in
the Georg e w . ; Brace, timber fraud case
was early forthcoming Uhis '[ morning.'
Hugh ii: Coombs, who was arrested re
cently with Brace in connection with
the alleged fraudulent location of pine
lands In Trinity County, took the stand
and turned State's evidence. He said
that Brace employed him to testify
falsely on many locations and also to
persuade others to adopt the same
course for the sum of $50. No less
damaging was the testimony given by
Ola Mulford, one of many, it is al
leged, who has located on lands
through the instrumentality of Brace
and his go-between.
George W. Brace Said to Have
Been the Principal
Operator..-,'
It is somewhat remarkable that. the syndicate writers for the
inland Republican press never gave a premonition of Rnef's de
' feat. The hammer was in constant use in hammering the San
Francisco Republican League. Several would-be party leaders and
more than one aspirant for Governor who came, to town to burn
incense at the shrine of Ruef will go hence with the incense intact.
The leaders and loyal workers of the Republican League* re
joice in the victory, but in the rejoicing reflect that another hard
battle must be fought and won to redeem the city fron?: the sway
of graft, loot and uncleanliness. At league iieadquarters last
night the district leaders exchanged greeting over the outcome of
the preliminary struggle at the polls. Special delight was mani
fested over the achievements in the Forty-second and Forty-third
Assembly districts, where the apostles of graft resorted to every
known sort of political misrepresentation to gain success.
In the Fortieth District Henry Ach was beaten out of sight.
He evidently suspected disaster when he declined to accept Jesse'
Marks' proffered wager of $1000 on the eve of election.
In the Forty-third District General Warfield is down and out.
Yesterday's result clearly foreshadows the defeat of Ruef and
Schmitz at the election in November. The Ruef Republican vote
and the labor union vote combined in yesterday'^ election repre
sents very nearly the whole voting strength of * Schmitz in San
Francisco. . * \u25a0 .
Forces of good citizenship, fighting under the standard of
the San Francisco Republican Leagxie, have achieved initial suc
cess in the contest with grafters, and now hold the advantage of
position for the great battle in November.
The victory- won at the primary election yesterday will in
spire citizens with renewed courage for the final struggle. That
the Ruef-Schmitr army of- grafters and looters, will in the final
conflict be driven from the field of power is almost certain.
The grafters in the primary engagement put. up powerful
and insolent resistance. They trampled the law under foot and de
fied the challengers who interposed to prevent the acceptance of
fraudulent votes. Reckless rounders in the service of Ruef com
manded labor union men in the voting booths and in the pres
ence of the police and election officers to vote the Ruef Republi
can ticket.
Inmates of the Almshouse and patients in the City and County
Hospital were led to the polls like sheep to the shambles and
forced to vote the Ruef ticket. Very nearly the entire labor union
vote of the town was thrown in the battle to reinforce the boss
of the Schmitz administration, but the courageous citizenship of
San Francisco broke the column of grafters and captured the
works.
The Republican League wins the Thirty-fourth, Thirty-fifth,
Thirty-sixth. Thirty-seventh, Thirty-eighth, Fortieth, Forty-first,
Forty-second and Forty-third Assembly districts, securing 231 of
the 399 delegates.
The Ruefters win the Twenty-ninth, Thirtieth, Thirty-first,
Thirty-second, Thirty-third, Thirty-ninth, Forty-fourth and Forty
fifth districts â 153 delegates.
Contention is vigorously made that the successful ticket in the
Twenty-eighth Assembly District, while not fighting under the
colors of the Republican League, is strictly anti-Ruef, and will not
at any stage take the Ruef programme. The district is represented
by 15 delegates.
The alignment in the convention will give the Republican
League 246 delegates, against 153 for Ruef, or a majority of 93.
â¢ The convention will be in position to repudiate and reject the Ruef
delegations from the Thirty-second and Thirty-ninth Assembly
districts, where fraud in the interest of the grafters was open and
notorious.

KANSAS CITY, Mo.. Aug. 8.-A Pull
man conductor on a train that/ came
from St. Louis had a surprise early this
morning. About one o'clock he was
aroused from sleep by a large,
powerfully built man in pajamas,
who suddenly stepped out in front of
him, and, pointing his linger, said earn
estly:
"I am sorry, but there's no vacancy.";
A moment of silence and again the man
spoke, gesticulating this timej Â£\u25a0 ' "
"I tell you." he s=aid. "there is no va
cancy. I saw the adjutant general and
he tells me the man is not dead." '
The train lurched and threw the' pas
senger against the side of a berth across
the aisle hard enough to awaken him.
"What was I saying?" the passenger
asked, when -he had righted himself and
opened his eyes. \u25a0
"I beg pardon," he added, "but I have
talked in my sleep and walked :in my
sleep for years." - \u25a0 â¢ .-. ' ' ;
Then the passenger went back to his
berth and the conductor wondered where
he had seen the man and heard the voice
before. He remembered, finally, that the
lace and voice were those of William
Warner, United States Senator from Mis
souri,' on his way back, from Washington.
Major Warner has always been some
thing of a somnambulist, but he' has
heretofore denied that Missouri's appli
cants for Senatorial favors have been
so numerous as to give him serious
trouble. . .
The men of the H and G companies
found the shell on, the range used last
night by the Thirteenth Field Artillery
and taking it to camp, they attempted to
open it. First they hammered it with
stones, then a monkey wrench was
brought Into play. Finally. Private Beggs
seized the projectile, slammed it down on
a rock between his legs. A loud report
followed and the air was filled with the
arms and legs of Beggs, flying dirt and
pieces of the shattered steel shell. -
When the smoke cleared away no trace
of the shell was to be found. The bleed
ing soldiers lay stunned and unconscious
on the ground. The seriously hurt were
removed to the hospital, where Beggs
died. Becker, Survant and Robinson
were brought to Fort Russell, where
Becker was operated on late to-night.
Surgeon Keffer says Becker will die be
fore morning. Survant. Robinson and
Dutted will recover.
CHEYENNE, Wyo.. Aug. B.â A three

it by the Emperor or his Ministers. It
will have the power to force the with

500 members, chosen by a system of indi

road between St. Petersburg and Moscow

The Judge said the defendant was
entitled to a speedy trial and in view
of his admission as to Mamie Schnled
er's testimony he would set the case for
trial on August 22 and meantime the

When the case was called yesterday
Attorney Murphy, for the defendant,
said he was ready for trial and would
admit in open court that If Mamie
Schneider was present she would tes
tify the same as at the preliminary
examination of- the - defendant. He
argued that the District Attorney had
not made a sufficient showing for a
continuance. There was nothing to
show that Norine Schneider Kelly
would ever be able to appear as a wit
ness. He was willing, in view of her
delicate condition, that her deposition
be taken either here or at Hollister,
where she was living.
District Attorney Bylngton argued
that a sufficient showing for a con

The defendant was now under sentence

EAST AT LOW RATE.
VICTORIA, B. C-, Aug. g.â News was
received by the steamship Kanagawa
Mara, which arrived from the Orient to
day, of a desperate plot for the running
of guns and ammunition to the rebels In
the Philippines, which was unearthed by
the detective department at Hongkong.
The plan was projected by a syndicate
which has previously been suspected of
gun running to various countries in the
Far East, and It was financed by men
who have ample funds at their command.
During the first week In July a foreign
er, who is not altogether unknown in
Shanghai, arrived in Hongkong. He met
some outside brokers, to whom he dis
closed his intention of running a big car
go of arm* and ammunition Into the
Philippines. The order had come, he
hint*d, through the revolutionary bands
in Samar and the other unsettled portions
of the Philippines. It was the first that
had been received and It was carried
out successfully and the rifles and am
munition landed secretly and handed over
to the guerrilla bands which continue to
haraEs the Americana, further orders
would be given.
He cecurcd 10.0W rifles and 1.000,000
rounds of. ammunition, which were se^
creted at Hongkong when the steamship
sailed. The enterprising foreigner want
ed a good dtal nigre than'lo,ooo rifles, but
for a first attempt that number would
do. The scheme seemed to be going on
famously, and there was little to do be
yond placing the arms and ammunition
aboard a vessel, which the leader of the
expedition was said to have In readiness,
when a cloud arose- There was some dis
sension among the filibusters. The au
thorities were Informed and the scheme
was nipped in the bud.

Injured while trying to break into a
house where there was â known to be a
case of yellow fever. Gregson was called
on to assist the authorities. So stubborn
was the opposition of the people at a
house on Charles street against invasion
by the . inspectors that it became neces
sary to break in, with the result that a
heavy , oaken ' door fell on Gregson and
crushed him. He was removed to the hos
pital. - -
Funerals of yellow fever patients and

LIVERPOOL, Aug. B.â Sir Alfred Jones,
president of the Liverpool School of
Tropical Medicine, has received | a cable
gram from Mayor Behrman in New Or
leans accepting an offer made yesterday
by Sir Alfred of the services of the
school durinar the .prevalence of yellow
fever. .Major Surgeon Donald Ross, pro
fessor of tropical medicine, and Dr. Rob
ert Boyce, professor of -pathology and
dean of the school, will 3 sail . for New
York on the steamship Campania next
Saturday and on : arrival will proceed at
once to New. Orleans.
Wednesday Is the day set for the gen
eral Etreet cleaning movement. There
will be a pretty general suspension of
business, all of the merchants volunteer
ing to lend their carts and wagons and
employes to assist In the work. Mayor
Behrman said the City "Hall would be
closed during the day. Meantime the city
Is arranging to continue the large forces,
of special men it put to work on Monday
during the rest of the week.
POLICEMAN INJURED.
Practically all doubt of the raising of
the fund of a quarter of=a million dol
lars desired' by the Government was re
moved to-day when both the State and
city moved to assist the citizens of New
Orleans. Governor Blanchard, whom
Chairman Janvier of the Citizens' Com
mittee has asked to advance $100,000,
wired Janvier that he would make the
loan as soon as he heard from a sufii
clent number of the members of the
Leflslature If they will support an ap
propriation of $100,000. Affirmative an
swers are being received. In addition
to this action of the Governor, the city
took steps to swell the fund. With $70.
000 originally In the hands of the Citi
zens' Committee, $220,000 is in sight.
Surgeon White put in a hard half-day's
work here and in the afternoon took a
train for Lafayette, La., to attend a con
ference of various health boards in that
section of the State, called with a view
to securing an amelioration of quarantine
regulations. Dr. White expects that by
to-morrow night all of the additional
health officers which the Governor has
ordered to New Orleans will be here and
ready to begin work.' It is considered not
improbable that.^he. marine hospital ser
vice will open a, supply depot at New Or
leans, where medicines and medical sup
plies may be furnished to those who are
in distress.
The Federal authorities have deter
mined to treat every case presenting
any symptoms of "^yellow fever as actu
ally yellow fever, preferring to take no
risk of failing through want of vigi
lance. -,-
It is announced that no more illegal
restrictions on travel or commerce will
be tolerated*. It is understood that the
action taken by the Board of Health has
the full sympathy of Governor Blanch
ard and that as a result, at least in
Louisiana, there will be a modification
of the present onerous quarantines. Be
cause of the large number of cases re
ported, the fever situation did not have
so favorable an aspect to-day, but It is
expected that' the increase is the result
of the investigation of a number of sus
picious cases of sickness, some ofwhich
the health authorities -were unable to
inquire into yesterday. The inspectors
of the Marine Hospital Service spent
much of the day in their investigation,
and their reports showed an increase In
the number of cases from noon to 3
o'clock.
ILLEGAL RESTRICTIONS.
The proclamation prohibits any town,

proclamation issued to-day, the "State

ILLEGAL RESTRAINT *
OF TRAVEL TO .STOP
BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Augr. B.â While
traveling at a speed of nearly forty
miles an hour, the recently launched
Herreshoff motor boat Den broka the
bronze rod of her steering gear, and,
swerving wildly, capsized, throwing out
her inventor, Charles F. Herreshoff, and
his machinist, S. Bases, and
doing considerable damage to the frail
craft. The men were rescued by RicliÂ»
ard Howell, editor of the Bridgeport
Herald; who was in a launch near by
taking photographs of the boat. Neither
man was injured.
The Den, since she was launched, baa
been; given daily speed trials on the
sound. While returning from a trip
this morning ehe struck the floating
stage of the Park City Yacht Club,
from which starts are made, disarrang
ing her steering gear. That was tem
porarily repaired and this afternoon the
boat, with Mr. Herreshoff at tte wheel
and his machinist watching the en
gine, started for another trial.
On her return the little ' craft was
sent along at top speed. Her progress
was shown only by a long streak of
foam, the boat hersftlf being almost In
visible.
Suddenly the Den swung sharply,
heeled over to starboard until the
whole line of her keel was visible, the
rapid concussions of the engine explos
slons stopped and the boat turned com
pletely over. Bage3 was thrown Into
the water, but Mr. Herreshoff became
entangled and went under the boat,
hanging downward in the water. The
leg of his trousers caught in the
sparking mechanism.
Kicking himself free, Mr. Herreshoff,
who is a good swimmer, reached the
surface and looked around for his ma
chinist Bages was struggling in the
water nearly twenty-five feet away.
"Can you swim?" shouted Herreshoff.
"No; hurry up and get to me. It's
hard to keep aSoatA wa3 the response.
Mr. Herreshoff swam rapidly to the
struggling man.
"Keep still when I reach you and
don"t grab me. If you keep cool I'll
have you over to the launch in no
time." was the advice of the inventor.
Bages obeyed instructions and/ Mr.
Herreshoff. easily towed him ashore-
PEKING, Aug. S. â The correspondent
of the Associated - Press is informed
that there is no foundation for - the
statement circulated' in the United
States that Wu Ting- Fang, former Min
ister at Washington, is responsible for
the Chinese anti-American boycott. Tho
agitation against dealing in American
goods and shipping on American steam
ers is spreading.
At the labor convention which will
meet at Toronto in a few days the real
right against exclusion will beyin and
steps will be taken to have Congress
petitioned to prevent any further modi
fications of the exclusion law.
CHICAGO, Aug. 8. â The Daily News
to-day, says:/
Disclosures made in connection with
frequent meetings held at secret ren
dezvous in this city have brought to
light that Chicago has played an in
itial part in Instituting the boycott now
raging in China against American
manufactures. Chin Pak Sun, a leading
Chinese merchant, outlined the situa
tion to-day. Rigid enforcement of the
provisions of the exclusion act stirred
the Chinese to dabbling In economic
studies. Three Chicago Chinese of
vrealth were barred from bringing
their wives into the United States.
These examples and others incensed
the Chinese, and. it now develops,
made possible the rapid growth and
successful development of the associa
tion that is now coaching- Chinese all
over the world.
President Roosevelt, in response to
this boycott, has directed .that more
liberal treatment be accorded the Chi
nese students and merchants who visit
the United States, and that as a result
of this order, Jt is declared, Chinese not
entitled to enter are pouring in at the
port of San Francisco by the hundred.
Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor, will
take personal charge of the fight
against any further letting down of
the bars, and will visit the various la
bor centers of the country for the pur
pose of arousing labor organizations to
action.
WASHINGTON*, Aug. Sâ Labor lead
ers have charged that a gigantic con
spiracy has beeÂ» entered into by the
enemies of organized labor to break
down the barriers against Chinese im
migration and undesirable immigration
of other classes for the purpose of
weakening: labor organizations in this
country. It is charged by labor. lead
ers that certain Chinese officials and a
number of American capitalists who are
opposed to organized labor have .: en
tered into a conspiracy to inaugurate
a Chinese boycott of American goods,
so that discrimination against Ameri
can eouds can be used -as a pretext -for
relaxing the rigor with which the Chi
nese exclusion laws have been admin
istered, particularly those sections re
lating- to the admission of merchants
and students.

J. Lucian Gleaveg, the temporary chair
man, pleaded for harmony and asked for
a "square deal" at the polls. Every men
tion of President Roosevelt's narna was
wildly cheered. Committees were ap
pointed and a recess was taken until S
o'clock this evening:.
Congressman Campbell Slemp, the onry
Republican Congressman from Virginia,
was introduced to the convention to
night and ha in turn introduced Secre
tary of the Treasury Leslie iL Shaw,
who had been invited to come to RoÂ»
noke to' address the convention. Mr.
Shaw was greeted with a stona Of
cheers. He spoke in part as follows:
The solrlt of the last half century w *Â» Re
publican. It was progressive. The spirit of
the twentieth century will te Republican. It
will be progressive. Judging tte future by
the pasf there is reason to doubt that the com
munities' most In harmony with the spirit of
the century will gather mostly a rich harvest
of progress. I come to preach the gospel of
American progress and to teach these prin
ciples and spirits which hayÂ« made us what
â¢wa are. and which will carry us to yet higher
planes and grander achievements whenever,
under God. the brain of the Srcth and the
brain 'of the North, the brain of the East asd 1
the brain of the West shall be allied for af
firmative acclamation and no portion of oar
common country shall be longer held to Its
negative traditions, which tend only to retard.
And now my friends, what are these prin
ciples that "divide parties? The parties sepa
rate primarily on question* of political econ
omy. Every Industrious citizen Is both a pro
ducer and a consumer. The dominant party
appeal* to the producer. It tells him that
the question of greatest Importance to him Is
the price at which he disposes of his products,
whether those products be labor or the results
of labor. The opposing party promises the
American consumer the best market In thÂ»
world In which to buy. The Republican party
promises the producer the best market In the
world In which to sell. ~
Gentlemen, we cannot have both. Our pwlt
lcal opponents may promise high-priced labor
and cheap products, high-priced wheat and
cheap bread, high-prloed cattle and cheap
meat but they make these promises without
possibility of fulfillment. Whenever they have
put their policies In operation we have had the
cheap products of labor, for tSe products of
cheaper foreign labor have found our markets
In superabundance. But cheap products of la
bor mean cheap labor. The cheap factory
product carries as a concomitant curse low
wages for the artisan, and low wages for the
artisan mean 3 curtailed consumption of farm
products and result* in & reduction in the
price thereof, while a reduction in price means
loss to the producer at clothes, of furniture, of
cars, of building materials aad every other
article of rural consumption. All this Is but
a came fcr stagnation and panic which have
marked every exi>eriment with tariff for reve
nue only from the beginning of our history
until now.' , " . , _. .
At the conclusion of Mr. Shaw s ad
dre's. the convention adjourned until to
morrow, when the committee on resolu
tions will report.

WAS THE
REAL THING
A wholesale firy goods man of Kansas
City wrote Captain Thornaa Holdsworth
of this city that he hud heard of his re-
covery from Brigfct's Disease and de-
aired to axk if it was a genuine case of
Eright's Disease. Following was the
captain's reply:
EAN FRAXCISCO. July 31. 1905.
John R. TowEeend. Esq.. Srr.ith-McCord-
Townsecd Co.. Kassas City. 3do. â Dear Sir: I
have ycurs of the 19th. I had a definite case
of Bright' s Disease, sad treated with the
best specialists In this city. I doctored for
â¢.bout two years before J heard of Fulton's
Conipocna. Several told me about it before
I treated the matter eerKrosly.
Tbe treatment got very little results at first.
twt ahout the sixth week I commenced to feel
the results. I think about the end of the
second dozes I ccncidescd myself practically
well. That was all of thre* years ago. and
I have now no symptoms of the disease to
rpealc of. although -once in a while I take
a, little of the icedieine.
I have told a rood rr.ary about it. result-
Ins; in many recoveries. I unhesitatingly re-
commend it to you. but will suggest patience,
fcr it takes months where the cases are stub-
born and it Is sot an ucccmsion thing for pa-
tients here to have to take it from six months
to a year. My belief !s that yoa /will almost
certainly recover, but you must take It' right;
In other words, live to the directions and con-
tinue the treatment without a break.
Very truly yours.

storm of fury by a strong wind which
began blowing at 10 o'clock on Monday
night, the waves of the mysterious Salton
sea dashed against the main line tracks
of the Southern Pacific, submerging three
miles more east of Salton and causing
extensive washouts in two places not pro
tected by the eleven miles of shoo-fly
trackage already built. As a result traf
fic over the main line was tied up from
Monday at midnight until the middle of
this afternoon. The Golden State Limit
ed and two sections of the Sunset Limit
ed arrived just before midnight, ten hours
behind time, bringing several hundred
passengers from points east, many of
whom went north on trains that were in
waiting.
The wind that swept the great body of
water subsided to-day and by arduous
work the tracks were repaired barely
enough to permit trains to creep across,
but the line will not be safe until the
shoo-fly Is completed from Salton to Der
mld. Then the entire threatened stretch
of fifteen miles will be safeguarded by a.

of Hoeye. The debt was not paid the
following' week, as promised, and bad
blood resulted. More than a score of
years passed, with no communication be
tween the men. Then Hoeye, finding him
self ill and penniless in the Tonopah dis
trict, wrote, asking his former friend for
the $3 and as much more as he could
spare. Maybell felt insulted, and when
the two accidentally met to-day In Fres
no Maybell leaped upon Hayes and pum
me!ed him with bis fists. Both men were
arrested.
FRESNO, Aug. B.â George Maybell and
Ira Hoeye, one time friends and partners
In business, met to-day for the first time

they engaged in a 6treet fight on account
of a little loan of $3 which one had made

"Daniel" hails from the Willamette
Valley. He came here In the straw
berry picking time, two of .his disciples
being with him at that time. One of
his followers was his son. They picked
berries and proselyted.
PORTLAND, Aug. 8. â Driven from
Hood River after prophesying that "the
town and valley would be destroyed by
a terrible outburst from Mount Hood
some time between July 27 and August
10, the "Second Daniel," as he terms
himself, has taken his .flock to the
White Salmon Bluff across the river.
Here, high above the Columbia, the
long-bearded patriarch and his follow
ers are hurrying the construction of an
ark to save themselves from being
overwhelmed by a great flood of water,
which, the patriarch says, is to follow
hard upon the volcanic outburst of
Mount Hood. There are not very many
in the band who believe In the "Second
Daniel," but they are working with
tremendous energy on the craft that Is
to save them.
No reception will be given to the Stock
ton visitors before next Thursday, which
is Oakland andÂ« Alameda day. At that
time a reception will be given to the peo
ple of all three cities in the California
building.
At 2 o'clock In the afternoon an Illus
trated lecture on Stockton and the Son
Joaquln Valley In the California lecture
rooms was given by Brown. At the con
clusion of the lecture no other formal ex
ercises were held, and the Stockton con
tingent started out to see the Fair, not
forgetting to "hit the trail," In true Cal
ifornia style.
PORTLAND, Aug. B.â Yellow ribbons
were very much In evidence to-day at the
Lewis and Clark Fair grounds. It was
Stockton day and the representatives of
that city arrived early and stayed all
day.
Exercises were held at the California
State Building at eleven o'clock this morn,
ing. De Caprlo's Administration Band
furnished the music and C. M. Mclsaac
for the exposition, Commissioner Filcher
for California and Calvin B. Brown for
Stockton furnished the oratory. All
who were presented with a hand
leather souvenir brought from Stock

SAX DIEGO, Aug. 8. â The slxty-elxttt
cuse has been added to the death roll
as a result of the explosion on the gun
boat Bennington in San Diega harbor
on July 21. Frederick J. Mueller die<l
this morning at the Barracks Hospital,
where a score of his comrades ara still
confined as a result of their lnluries.
Mueller was SI years old. was ohiei
sallniaker's mate and enlisted at San
Francisco. He was terribly burned
ebout the head, neck, arms and hands,
but though his wounds have been heal
ing satisfactorily, little hope of vi*
recovery has been entertained at any
time. His death was directly due to
\u25a0ulcer of the stomach, a secondary com
plication. All day yesterday he grÂ«iw
worse and a surgeon and nurse were
with him constantly last night.
It Is believed no further deaths will
occur among the victims. Arrange
ments are being made for transferring
the rest of the injured to Mare Island
Hospital, where skin grafting will be
performed upon several of them.
The board of inquiry has finished
taking testimony and Is now engaged
In hearing the opinions of experts as
to how the explosion occurred. The
findings of the board will probably l-e
handed to Admiral Goodrich within
two or three days.
The work is the most extensive of
the kind ever undertaken In this sec
tion of California. It Is estimated that
nearly a million tons of rock and 2000
cords of brush will be required to place
the river banks in satisfactory condi
tion. The work will be paid for out of
the funds voted by the last Legislature
and by private donations on the part
of the Eel River dairymen and farm
ers, .who have been contributing liber
ally. In the end thousands of dollars
will be annually saved the people of
the county. The principal work will be
done in the vicinity of Fortuna. There
is a big bend in the river at that point,
which has been a source of danger for
years. With Rolley Crossing, about a
mile distant, it has been considered the
key to the entire Eel River situation.
This work in a measure will be ex
perimental and if successful will be fol
lowed up by larger appropriations un
til the stream has been rendered as
safe from damaging overflows as pos
sible. It is believed that this work will
serve to demonstrate whether the wa
ters of the Eel River can be sufficiently
confined during the winter season,
when many acres of valuable dairy
land are washed away. Several local
contractors, who will bid on the work,
left for Sacramento this morning.
EUREKA, Augr. 8. â Forty thousand
dollars will be expended within the
next three months in protecting the
banks of the Eel River and adjacent
lands from the devastating: floods of
winter. Contracts for. the work will
be let by State Highway Commissioner
Nathaniel Ellery at his office in Sacra
mento on Thursday at noon. If the
successful bidder Is to complete the
task within the specified time it will
be necessary to begin work almost Im
mediately, for the specifications call
for the completion of the contract not
later than October 25 of the present
year.

Women who suffer with disorders peco-

and receive tree the advice of a physician
of over forty years' experienceâ -a skilled
and Enooessiui specialist in the diseases
of women. Every letter has the most
careful consideration and is regarded a*
$acredly confidential. Many sensitively
modest woraen wrfte fully to Dr. Pierce
what they would shrink from telling to
their local physician. The local physician
is pretty sure to say that he cannot do
anything without " an examination." Dr.
Pierce holds that these distasteful exam-
inations are generally needleas, and that
no woman, except in rare cases, should
submit to them.

an Italian. Peyton made a lunge at
Barrl and stab>ed h!;n in the breast,
inflicting a womid a foot long.
Fortonatrty the blow . had lost Its
force by the time the knife cut through

arrested and taken to Martinez, where
he was charged witn assault to murder.

OAKLAND, Aug. S. â Company A of
the Fifth Regiment of the National
Guard, which company has the honor
of having once been commanded by
Governor p Pardee â¢ and by Adjutant
General J. B. Lauck, is facing a new
armory and a new set of officers to
dedicate the new home of war and
peace. The new armory is well under
way and will be "completed in about
thirty days, but from indications it
will be more than thirty days before
the company gets its new set of officers,
owing to the red-tape that has to be
gone through in the various elections.

The total amount of the subscriptions
so far received for the aid. of the Fe'r

this considerable clothing and a number
of articles of household furniture havo
been donated. The petititon which was
circulated asking aid fot the family vas
prepared by Manuel Rapose and nis wife
on the day after the fire, and since then
the former has spent the greater part of
his time in securing subscriptions.
This amount, modest as it is, repre
sents more. than 100 subscribers. Mo^t of
them are poor people, who gave what
little tiiey could afford.. Few subscrip

Not a single person to who m the list was
presented refused to contribute to the ani
of the unfortunate family, even the chil
dren coming forward with their \u25a0Mniea.
One of the first to offer aid was Mrs. W.
J. Culligan, the wife of a well known
Oakland furniture dealer, who gave a
kitchen stove, two tables, at bed and
mattresses, a dresser and several chairs,
and other household articles to Mrs. Fer

ALAMBDA COUNTY HUMS
FLA3IES THREATEN
HELPLESS WOMAN
OAKLAND. Aug. B.â Sheriff Carnet has
been working carefully in his investiga
tion of the offenses charged against the
"Jim Crow gang." Some are being proved
against the youngsters, who are now in
his custody. Biaker, Scbiielder and Pem
broke will be arraigned before Justice
Geary in East Oakland to-day. To-day â¢
James Crow hurst was charged witb rob- j
bery fcr the hold-up of Ed Stanley in
East Oakland. Elmer Crowhurst, the
younger of the two Crowhuret boys and
the j-oungest of the gang, has not yet
been charged, and Sheriff Baraet is going
to try to have him sent to a reform j
school instead of blasting his life with a j
State's prison record.
Sheriff Barnet has been working upon \u25a0
a theory that these boys shot Policeman >
George Brown last winter. He has que*--- ,
tioned the boys upon this point, but has !
b^en met with denials .up to the present. \
. This shooting occurred at the very time :
the i>oys admit that they were operating J
nearly every night in and around Oak- j
land. * Sheriff Barnet believe* that one or
more of the members of the sang we:e
held up by Brown, and v.hen they
tnought that they were about to be ar
rested with booty upon them thsy shot
rather than be captured, having as few
â¢ compunctions of conscience, over a po
liceman as they did over young Cook.
WERE AFTER PRATHKB.
It is thought that the boys had planned
to hold up Thomas Prather, president of
the Union National Bank. This is caused
by statements of the younger Crowhurst
and Pembroke. The last named was
working on Mr. Prathers house and tried
to get Crowhurst a job repairing a lawn
mower. Crowhurst came to the house
end was refused the work. He then told
Crowhurst that he wanted help in a few
nights holding up a banker who had a
benk on Hie corner of Twelfth street and
Broadway. This would apply to Mr. j
Prather. whose bank is on that corner, j
The elder Crowhurst make? a denial of
this, the denial, however, not being be
lieved by Sheriff Barnet.
Pembroke and Crowhurst each say that
Blaker told them he had once killed a
Chinaman by throwing a rock at him and
fracturing his skull. There is no record
of any such a killing, and Sheriff Barnet
believes that Blaker merely wished to
pose before the others as a bad man,
and told this story to increase his hold
Â«n the others. . .'
SISPECTED OF HOLDUPS.
The two Crowhurs t boys once followed
Justice Geary, before whom they will
hay? to appear to-morrow, and tried to j
find an opportunity to hold him up.~l^ater
Juetice Geary employed the younger
Crowhurst, who is a good musician, to
play the piano for an evening's entertain- j
tnent for him. The younger Crowhurst |
Is authority for this story.
f There is a multitude of small hold-ups
that it is believed could be traced to
these boys. At the time they were oper
ating last winter dozens of small rob
beries took place, all of the same general
character as those already confessed to j
by the boys, and it is a practical cer- J
talnty that they did the majority of j
them. Â« -.-. -â¢':..;
Sheriff Barnet has done excellent work
on this case and in two weeks has land
ed most of the members of the gang, se
cured fuil confessions from them, recov
ered the money and secured enough evi
dence to absolutely convict the three who j
participated in the murder.
James Crowhurct to-night confessed
to having robbed, a year ago last June,
the store of the man they afterward j
murdered. CrowhurEt says that Blaker,
Pembroke and himself entered the
store and got a little over $5 in coin
and groceries worth 5.150.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Aug. 8-~
The Stanford student, E. G. Dudley 06.
who made the ascent of Mount Rainier
with G. R. Glasscock U. C. '08 by way of
the southeastern spur, arrived here to
day. . The feats of daring performed by
the ambitious collegians in climbing the
mountain by the route which had foiled
all aspirants has filled old mountaineers
with awe. > : Â«^V.-f Â«â¢ ,' .
Dudley and Glasscock originally in
tended to make the ascent in the accus
tomed manner. With this, idea they
joined the Sierra Club and journeyed
to. the base of the mountain. At this
point the ascent by the forbidding side
appealed to the young men and they ac
cordingly altered their plans. leaving
their friends to ascend by the regular
\rail on the western side.
The start was made at six In the morn
ng and it was not until fourteen hours
ater that they reached the crater at the
summit. In traversing the snow belt,
they were often obliged to proceed with
the aid of a life line. -The young men
upon reaching their goal sought shelter
in a crevice where they were found the
following morning by their friends of the
Sierra Club.
Both young men are well known "at
their respective colleges. Dudley played
right field on the Stanford Varsity
baseball team. G. R. Glasscock did not
return, but remained to* further fulfill his.
desire to climb to high altitudes, by
'scaling Mount Baker.
Speculation is rife as to who will be
appointed by Governor Pardee to the
vacancy created, and among those men
tioned are District Attorney T.IW. Har
ris, ex-Judge John Yule and Attorney
John Stetson. The latter, however,
states that he is not a- candidate. The
names of other attorneys have been
mentioned, but have not had the sanc
tion of tht l men themselves. As a rep
resentative of Washington, Murray and
Plcasanton townships, it is believed
that Harris has a strong political back

AFRICAN TKIBESHEX
MASSACRE WHITES
The young Sultan came to the throne
with little knowledge of the world be
yond the walls of his harem, but he had
sense enough to recognize that Kaid
Maclean was the strong and safe man on
whom he should lean for support. As the
power behind the throne the influence of
the Scotchman became greater than ever.
In 1901 a knighthood was conferred upon
him for his assistance to British diplo
macy in Moroccb. The strenuous lighting
lifeâ fighting barbaric tribesmen, fighting
the cholera scourge, fighting the wiles of
European diplomacyâ has agreed well
with him. Though his' beard- and mus
tache are white and his hair frosted, at
57 he is still as hard as nails and far
more agile than most men at 40., A few
years ago on one of his visits to England
he bought for the young Sultan, who
takes a child-like delight in a : new toy,
an up-to-date hansom. It was duly landed
at the coast,' and then came the problem
of getting it across to Fez. To the Moors
it seemed impossible. But the Kaid, who
had overcome so many difficulties, made
light of this one. He mounted the box,
cracked his whin and started off on a
drive of 120 miles across a country inno
cent of roads. And he reached Fez as
fresh as though he- had merely taken a
spin up Piccadilly.
Many are the stories told of his won-,
derful powers of endurance. He has often
been In the saddle nineteen hours out of
the twenty-four. He has indomitable
pluck and perseverance. After he had
lost the sight of 'his right eye he made
himself a dead shot from the left
shoulder, and his one good eye has
proved better than any two ordinary op
tics. He Has not fared badly at the hands
of.. the two Sultans whom he has served
so faithfully. He has a magnificent resi
dence In Morocco City and another fine
house at Fez. He invariably dresses when
at court in the picturesque native cos
tume, as shown in the accompanying
photograph, plus cavalry riding boots. As
a memento' of the land of his ancestors
he keeps a fine set of- Scotch pipes, on
â¢which he is no mean performer. The mu
sic:that he gets out, of them is of a kind
that the natives appreciate much more
than that of modern instruments. It re
sembles their own. ; .
The one mistake of his career Was his
marriage to the Spanish beauty, Whose
Intrigue with | Lieutenant : Mortimer, sev
eral years younger than herself,; brought
the Kaid to ' London to seek a divorce.
Tne Sultan told \ him he could . show him
a trick worth two of that, but," of course,
he refused to iadopt the Moorish method
of getting ;,rld of : an" unfaithrul; spouse
and settling accounts with the "co-re-
LONDON. Aug. B.â Kaid Sir Harry
Maclean, chief military adviser to the
Sultan of' Morocco, whose suit for di
vorce has furnished London with ltd
latest sensational scandal, is one of the
most picturesque characters that this
prosaic generation has furnished.
Something less than thirty years ago
he was an inconspicuous subaltern In a
British regiment stationed at Gibraltar,
with small prospects of ever achieving
distinction, when his Sherlfian Majesty
across the straits conceived the idea
that it would be a good thing to have
his army instructed in the art of war
by the infidel. He confined his ambi
tion to the late Sir John Drummond
Hay, then British Minister at the Sul
tan's court, and as a result young Mac
lean was. offered the post of musketry
instructor to the Moorish army. Being
a Scotsman and therefore far-seeing he
jumped at the chance.
He taught the Moors how to shoot,
but he did more than that â he grained
the confidence of his imperial master,
"the King, of the Age, the Prince of
Believers, my Lord El Hassan," and a
few years found him standing next to
the throne Itself, as Its chief diplomatic
as well as military adviser. Without
changing his faith or ceasing to be a
canny Scot, Kaid Maclean became to all
intents and purposes a Moor. He
roamed the wild country with the no
madic court and was often the only
link between El Hassan and the Min
isters of the powers.- who sat with
folded hands at Tangier. \u25a0\u25a0 Of course his
influence with the Sultan excited much
Jealousy and there were, many who
watched his career with the green eyes
of envy. A "military mission" from
France was placed "at his Majesty's
disposal," but all efforts to undermine
Kaid Maclean's influence and authority
proved futile. He accompanied the Sul
tan on many expeditions against re
bellious tribes and was with him on
that last dread march from Marrakesh
to Rabat when the "Son of Mahomet,"
a weary and broken old man, suc
cumbed to the hardships of a forced
passage across the Atlas ! Mountains
against a people in revolt. \u0084It was im
perative that the death of the Sultan
should be concealed until his favorite
son had been proclaimed his successor
lest some usurper should grab the
vacant throne. So, with Kaid Maclean
marching by the side of it, the body
was borne on a state litter, and the
sheikhs and khalifas paid homage to
the poor clay under its trappings of
green and gold just as though it were
their royal master alive and powerful.
In secret the body was carried into
Rabat at dead of night through a hole
in the wall. . , . .â¢

without a scratch. He assisted In re

boring store.
"It all appened in a minute," said he,
"I was engaged in getting my stock in
shape and there were not a half-dozen
customers in the store at that time. I
heard a roaring and tearing sound, and
then the crash came. The shrieks that
followed drowned out every other
sound. ' Many of the girls sank behind
their counters and had to be dragged
out in a fainting- condition."
The work of rescue was soon begun.
Firemen and laborers worked with
v partly by the company and partly by the
estate of the late David Orr. The loss to
the company id estimated at between $2 ( W,-
OuQ and $3tw,<AK). The was a very
oid one, but until now was consid*red
perfectly safe.
The names of the dead thus far re

Fitzgerald. Frank Leonard, Miss Minnie
Mallard, Miss Alice L. Sharp, juiss Min

The fatally injured: Miss Helen Don

The list oi" injured, us compiled to
night, shows that thiny-six employes of
the company were injured, three seri
ously. Besides these, nve shoppers were
injured.

\u25a0was the crash and I caw him no more."
TI2L.L.S HOW IT HAl'l'EXiiD.
The pillars which gave way supported
ihe ends of two giant girders and when
they fell the main support of the central
part of the building was gone. With a
noise that could be heard blocks away
and which shook the adjoining buildings
nearly half the great structure from the
cellar to tiie roof and extending from one
sidewalk ,to the other came gtinding down.
IVhen the lire department arrived there
wat plenty to do m rescuing those who
wcie ;.:.:.\u25a0\u25a0: under the lop wreckage.
In j. short time the city's entire hospital
and ambulance lorce was on the scene,
aided by half a hundred doctors from all
parts of the city. The volunteer rescuers
and Bremen continued the work until
\u2666^nausted. when their places were taken
by . n \u25a0 Â«-rÂ«ci(his force numbering 300 men
trom the New Vcik Central and Dela
waie and Hudson railroads. These delved
in the rums all night, "but the work of res
cue proceeded slowly. When darkness
came it was estimated that nearly fifty
persons still remained in the ruins and
that nut more than half of those could
survive the weight pressing upon them.
Fortunately the wreckage did not take
lire. Sonn; 100 persons are still unaccount
ed for, but fifty of these are cash boys
of which the n'rm has no record, and tne
loss of the pay roll makes It difficult to
Â«ot ajiything like a complete list of
many others. In all the company has iw
tmyloyes, but fifty of these are away

down with it over 100 persons. Caught in
a chao~ of brick, plaster and wooden
b"ams, between twenty and thirty men,
worrt-n and cnildrcn met death. Twelve
hours' frantic work on the part of an
a: my cf rescuers disentangled tifty per
tor.s, six uf them dead and many of the
rest badly injured. Three bodies were
ir: s:^ht :it a late hour to-night, but many
hours' work will be tequjred to get them
out. An> thing like a complete list of the
killed and injured will be unobtainable
until the workers have made their way
Jo the very bottom of the mass of -wreck
age. With few exceptions, those caught
in the i uin were employes, a large ma
jority of them being girls. The collapse
occurred shortly after the opening hour
when barely a score of shoppers were in
the ttore. A clock found in the debris
had stopped at twelve minutes before 9
o'clock, showing when the crash came.
The best account ,cf the event that
probably caused the ruin is given by the
head of the crockery, glass and drug
department, which occupies the basement.
"The workmen were sawing at a wood
en btam." eaid he, "which runs under the
northern end of the pillars in the middle
ot the- store. Excavation for the cellar
was j;oing on about the base of the pil
lat and I believe that jarring of the beam

Apropos of the fact that the usual re

use of water from the John Brown spring
or of Kansas crude oil in christening the

There are few hostesses in official life
left in the national capital and there
will be still fewer during the early part
of August. After that an influx to town
of many of those I , who departed in the

not due to foreign control of the line.

"China wants to purchase the rail

It was at first thought that the man

but it was later learned, after the wound
was examined and the doctor talked with
the patient, that the wound was not re

Governor MeGh's'Prettu Daughter
I to Christen the Big Battleship
Kansas at Camden Saturday
rTpHE United States battleship
I Kansas, to be launched at the
â¢\u25a0\u25a0 yards of the New York Shipbuild
ing Company, Camden, on the TÂ£th,
will be the largest battleship that has
ever glided into the Delaware and will
be christened by Miss Anna Hoch,
daughter of Governor Hoch of Kansas.
Miss Hoch is looked upon by the poli
ticians of her State as one of the
strongest gubernatorial influences, says
the Philadelphia Inquirer. Although
she is only just past her majority she
is close to her father in all of his ad
ministrative duties and it is said that
he consults her almost daily. The po
litical leaders in Kansas have not been
slow in making the discovery that Gov
ernor Hoch is a great respecter of his
daughter's opinion, jm& many of them
are wont to "carry^thelr woes to her
first and "beg her to intercede for them
with the Governor.
MISS ANNA HOCH.
THE deplorable disaster on the United
States warship Bennington could not
have occurred on any merchant
steamer; It would not have occurred
had the navy system In regard to the
care and operation of ships' machinery
been half as good as that which obtains
in any merchant service; it would not
have been conceivable had a similar sys
tem in regard to engineers in charge on
naval ships been in force as is maintained
in every merchant line. It may be furth
er remarked that had the condition of the
Bennington's boilers, as reported, been
known to exist on any merchant steamer
no crew could have been got to stay on
board of her. says the American Syren
and Shipping.
It is certainly extraordinary that a
Government which imposes all sorts of
stringent inspection requirements upon
merchant vessels does not in its depart
ment of the navy exact similar efficiency.
One not infrequently hears of a merchant
steamer putting back to port when a day
or so out because some flaw has been
discovered in the engines or machinery
and repairs have become necessary to
insure safety, but one never hears in
this generation of a boiler explosion.
One nften finds in ocean steamers boil
ers that are sixteen, eighteen or twenty
years old and still in active service, but
one never hears of boilers in active sea
service with reduced pressure because
they were unfit to stand the - strain, as
was'the case in the Bennington. A mer
chant steamship's boilers are required
to be competent to do the work for which
they were designed; they must do it, or
the ship cannot perform her service, so
when - necessary new boilers are installed.
So inconceivable was the occurrence on
the Bennington to practical marine engi
neers and official inspectors in this city
that they at first refused to believe it.
imagining that a magazine of ammuni
tion had more likely exploded. An ex
planation that the safety valve might
have stuck seems almost incredible in
these days, though possible a generation
ago; consequently the competent critics
have been puzzling their brains to com
prehend the cause.
It seems possible that through careless
ness a sudden forte from other boilers
was turned into this weak one, thus caus
ing the disaster, but this should not have
been the case with skilled men in charge.
Furnaces usually become wasted in ths
line of the fire bars, or, to use a common
phrase, between the line of the heat and
the cooler line of the ash pit. That is
generally the place where the first weak
ness sets in. It is also possible that the
boilers may not have been as clean as
they might be, and shortness of water
might likewise have occurred. Whatever
may have been the cause, however, ia
practically immaterial now.
Secretary Bonaparte will find that- in
merchant steamers engines and boilers
are continuously and repeatedly inspected
by the surveyors to Lloyd's and kindred
institutions m order to maintain their
class, whereas the navy Is a law unto
itself' in regard to Inspection.. It. will also
be found that the merchant services
which are most efficiently managed are
likewise most economically managed, both
in' regard to machinery and iren; the
regular limited staff of the engine-room
consequently know every smallest part
of their machinery, and there is no dan
ger of "too many cooks spoiling the
broth" as there is with a large crew in
a warship. Indeed, so excellent has the
policy been found of carrying a minimum
of an efficient crew in a steamer, that
it may be well worthy of consideration
whether it might not be advisable to
adopt in the navy somewhat the system
of a merchant line, having a permanent
minimum force for each ship, the men
of which shall be entrusted absolutely
with the care, maintenance and operation
of the vessel, and not to be interfered
with by the members of any auxiliary
force carried for fighting purposes. Until
some such' thorough reforms are effected
we cannot be said to possess a satis
factory and reliable navy.

that I will not blight your faith in the
least when I call your attention to the
fact that the man who broke the bank
displayed much energy, and even more
skillâ yet he is reposing in a peniten
tiary at the present time. Possibly it
depends more or less on how the en

,rnHE cotton growers, well organized, have determined to make*
I the Wall street speculators pay 12 cents for cotton or be
*â¢ squeezed out. The season's crop is estimated at 9,000,000
bales. The foreign demand is heavy, the old crop is nearly ex
hausted, qjid it looks as though the growers are "it,". provided they
can hold on long enough. While everybody will rejoice to see;
the producer get what is coming to him, it must not be forgotten
that when he holds beyond the marketable stage of his crop he be
comes himself a speculator in prices.
From another standpoint, holding the crop out of the market
for a raise increases the energy of such cotton manufacturing coun
tries as England and Germany in developing new cotton raising
rji.^tricts. in order to release them from dependence on American
raw cotton. England has been making great exertions in Egypt
and India to produce cotton, and it is possible that new fields may
be found in the Congo basin and other parts of Africa. So far, it
has seemed that our Southern States have almost a monopoly of the
physical conditions best adapted to the production of cotton. But
the cotton growers may well answer that the cotton lands may be
switched to other forms of production.
This is true, but it may be doubted that any other crop will be
found as profitable. Formerly it was supposed that Louisiana, the
first part of the South that was exploited.- in agriculture, could only
produce indigo, and the French planters found that a very profitable
crop, until some disease or insect enemy beset the indigo and its
production became impossible, and Louisiana switched to sugar
cine, of which she has remained the principal American producer.
But, after us the deluge, and the fight between the planters and the
speculators will be watched with keen interest, and the sympathy,
if not the betting, will be on the side of the planters.
It is not generally remembered but it is a fact that California
has been proved to have as good cotton lands as those of the Gulf
States. The fiber was once grown quite extensively in Kern
Count}' and the cotton' mills in Oakland found it to be a fine prod
uct, v.ith good staple and gloss, capable of being worked into as
good fabric as any grown anywhere.
It is not impossible that we may yet see a large cotton produc
tion in the San Joaquin Valley and profitable hemp or ramie farm
ing in the Sacramento Valley. The tendency here is to increase the
variety of our crops, to carry all our eggs in one basket less than we
have been doing, and clothing and rope fiber is every year in greater
demand.

OUT OF THE MOUTHS OF BABES
CHAUFFEUR DEATH had got out
of his automobile and was about
to carry the lately released soul to
the Highest Court of Appeals.
The lately released soul stood in
the automobile for a scant moment,
and then suddenly and wildly made a
convulsive grasp at the empty space
above its ethereal head.
"Here!" the great chauffeur cried,
"What are you doing?"
The soul looked vaguely about it,
grasped the situation and gasped, "Iâ â¢-
.1 â er^â well â excuse me-" <
The soul stood quietly for v very
brief period; then a dazed expression
stolo over its phantom countenance,
and it again madly clutched* at the
ether above it.
"Say, stop that, can't you?" the,
chauffeur cried. "You make me ner
vous. What are you trying to do, any
way?"
"I â T â well, to state the fact, I have
been in the habit of riding home from
the office on a. street car, and I can't
get over the feeling that I ought to
grab a strap."
The great chauffeur smiled pitying
ly, "Well, do the best you can,".. he
said. "Nobody has to hang to straps
on this side of the river."
The lately released soul sighed, but
the sigh was one of ineffable content.
"Drivo on," }t said; "drive on where
you will. Wherever you take me it is
evident that there .will' be at least one
heavenly characteristic connected with
it."
As they rode on the soul was smiling
blithely.
THE FORCE OF HABIT.
NEITHER improving nor retrograding is the questionable coi>
dition of the country in regard to railroad accidents as shown
by the latest bulletin issued by the Interstate Commerce
Commission and covering the reports for the first three months of
ihis year. If we ask whether to congratulate ourselves upon thus
holding our own, or to regret that the experiences and opportuni
ties of a whole year have not resulted in our being more- careful
and clever in avoiding those railroad disasters which are in the
United States immensely more frequent than in Great Britain, there
is nothing in the bulletin of accidents that makes reply.
The totals of the tables of fatalities, injuries and destruction of
3>roperty are not much different from the reports covering the same
quarter of last year. The latest report shows collisions and derail
ments for three* months were 3108, or over 1000 per month. The
property damage wss $2,449,245. There were 909 people, killed
and 14,397 injured. Some of the worst of these accidents are in no
way the fault of the railroad management, but resulted from defects
of personality in the workmen which probably could not have been
foreseen by their superiors except in a calculation on general aver
ages, which could estimate the percentage of derelictions but could
not name the particular individuals who were going to fail.
The report, then, seems mainly useful as a study of personali
ties of workers â their habits of mind which mislead them so as to
cause grievous mistakes. A little consideration of the causes of
these accidents would be not only a warning to employes who are
intrusted with the care of many human lives besides their own, but
by analogy might assist the minds of all workers to be more securely
careful at their tasks.
Most of these personal causes of disasters have been often pon
dered upon, such as inattention, sleepiness from 1 overfatigue, drunk
enness, etc. ; but the one which may most need a comment that will
tend to fix it in the memory is the peculiar trick of the mind in
getting an impression, or imagining it has got an impression, when
there is no real reason or excuse for this impression. In the case
of one collision the surviving engineman of the disaster had "got an
impression" in his mind that the meeting order specified another
station five miles beyond the place where the colliding meeting took
place. ,
He had not come by this impression in any rightful way, and
could not even explain it himself. It was allowed to intrude into
his head in some irregular way. The result of that baseless impres
sion was four dead, six injured and over $15,000 damages. It is
plain from this that the attention involving large responsibility re
quires a double mental effort of not only heeding the impressions
on which we are to act but of remembering back to the authority
for the impression. This may not be always possible, but, like
other habits of mind, is probably susceptible to improvement by
cultivation.
In many instances it might be a practical rule of thought and
conduct when recollection failed to distinguish clearly what was the
base or authority of the impression to seek promptly for some bet
ter reason for action than a vague impression of unrevealed par
entage. " '
The most gratifying feature of the report is that only one of
the accidents was caused by drunkenness. As long as men will stay
sober so that intelligence can reign the other defects of personality
are likely. to be mastered, and the country is certainly improving in
the insistence that its workers must not get under the influence of
liquor. '

LONDON, Aug. B.â American tourists
when ' they "do" the .Thames cannot fail
to.be/ impressed by the stately Jacobean
mansion which overlooks the river as It
sweeps by Richmond. It has the most
prosaic of namesâ Hani House, the origin
of which nobody, knowsâ but it Is full of
historic and romantic associations. The
vandal hand'bf the modern renovator and
restorer has never been laid, upon it. It
stands as it has stood since' it was built
in J6lO. The visitor for whom -the iron
gates of its beautiful grounds swing open
has a rare privilege, and it is small won
der that the garden â¢ party held there the
other day for the- benefit of ,the Church
Army attracted a brilliant throng.
The grounds of Ham House boast noble
elms and bay trees, together with tall
Scotch firs, the first ever planted on Eng
lish soil. There are roses, irises and lilies
in profusion, while clematis and honey
suckle climb the garden walls and the
lawns are ablaze. with the brilliant color
ing of rhododendrons and azaleas. To
turn from the old world gardens to the
old house itself completes the transporta
tion from the twentieth century to the
seventeenth. Under its stimulus one can
easily imagine hinaself in the gay period
of the cavaliers, when life had- not lost
its spice and the spirit of adventure ran
in most men's breasts and the jest flew
lightly from lip to lip.
" It is this that constitutes the magic of
the house j which Charles I gave to his
favorite companion, William Murray,
whom he afterward created first Earl of
Dysart. It allows one with ease to travel
back athwart the centuries to the bygone
years when English history was so active
and stirring. Even the statue of the
water god that seems to guard the des
tinies of the river helps the transition.
One can shut .one's eyes for a moment
and then opening them seem to see the
beautiful women and gallant men step
out of their frames In the hall and stalk
forth into existence again.
: Here comes my lovely lady who-mar
ried the Duke of Lauderdale. She has the
cleverest intellect in Lqndon and loves
money, and is not at all scrupulous how
she acquires it. It is better to bribe her
than to incur her enmity. And there goes
the traitor Duke! He is making for the
room where sits the famous "cabal" min
istry of Charles llâ of the five rogues
none more unprincipled than himself.
_Jl curious hush seems to fall on the
senses in the presence of the old family
portraits of Earls and Countesses long
since departed, but whose lineaments
have been preserved by the genius of
Kneller, Lely, Hoppner. Janssen and Sir
Joshua Reynolds. Could .they speak
some' of . : themâ how tame would appear
even Macaulay's annals in contrast with
the narratives they could unfold.
The historic treasures of Ham House
would take a long catalogue to
enumerate. In a little box In a small
cabinet is a lock of hair that once grew
on the head of Robert pevereux. Earl
of EÂ§sex, the ill-starred favorite of
Elizabeth. Appropriately enough, close,
by are two miniatures of that great
Queen, one of which was painted when
she was a girl, and is absolutely
unique. It is very small, but it would
â¢sell for enough to render a person of
moderate tastes independent for ; the
rest of his days. The old house con
tains many relics Qf the past that are
equally -valuable. All the furniture is
antique and nearly every piece has its
associations. In the spacious Genoese,
velvet-covered chairs most of the
Stuart Kings have lolled. There are
tables on which they played cards with
people who did not always play a
square game. One thing only does the
place lack to complete its attractions â
a ghost. None of the historic cham
bers la haunted. No mysterious visit
ant paces the corridors at midnight. It
is said the specters all decamped when
the electric lights were Introduced. No
self- respecting spook will submit to
that* sort of lllumtnant In his favorite
lair.

OYSTER BAY. Aug. B.â President
Roosevelt has been informed through
the Department of State that the Fed
eral Court of Venezuela has rendered,
a decision against the Bermudez As

the so-called Hamilton concession, an
nulling the concession.
What action may be taken by this
Government regarding the matter can
not be announced at this time; in fact,
so far as can be ascertained here, no
determination of the question has been
reached. It is quite probable that
nothing will be done until Secretary
Root, who is now on a vacation In Lab
rador, shall have rteurned to the
United States and considered the sub
ject with the President in the light of
the report which Will be made by Judge
Calhoun of his Investigation of the

the abolishing of the Tulare experi
mental agricultural station, the peti
tioner* claiming that the proposed cen

In the rear, is the city residence of
John D. Rockefeller and near by are
the residences of William Rockefeller,
H. McK. Twombley. Colonel J. J. Mc-

Church was practically the center, The
fire was confined to the church. De
fective electric wiring is supposed to

home was in danger. Fireman, who
stood with their hose lines in the win

Rheumatism
â¢ ; Like Neuralgia, is now known
fo be a nervous disease. The
kidneys become weak through .
lack of nerve energy, and fail
to filter the uric acid from the
blood; this acid attacks and
burns the nerves and muscles,
and consumes the oil in the
joints, producing inflammation,
fever, swellingrâpainu
To cure Rheumatism, then,
you must restore the kidney
nerves and muscles, and neu-
tralize the effect of the acid
upon the joints and tissues
with Dr. Miles' Restorative
Nervine, a nerve medicine,
-which has made many cures of
this painful disease. Nervine
strengthens the kidney nerves
and increases the circulation,
and relief is assured..
â¢'Before I took Dr. Miles' Nervine.
I had bÂ»en looking for a cure for
nheumatism for 25 years.- The last
tJaie I wai laid tip for several months,
could not get out of bed or set foot
on the floor. I tried remedies to rub
in. to drink, doctors' prescriptions.
etr...- but nonÂ« of them had any effect.
One <iay-. I read about Dr. Miles'
Nervine and got a bottle. After the
f.rrt dose I had a sood nlphfs rest,
an<l after taking half a bottle the
pains disappears, and I went out and
wailed all around the town. In a week
I went to work, and waa perfectly
curod. but continued to take the
medicine for a time, to make sure the
pain* would not come^acJc'-^^

SEATTLE.
SEATTLE, Aug. S.â When the fifth
inning opened this afternoon the Seals
gave every indication of pocketing, the
ball game with ease. But at that stage
the home team took heart and began to
pound Hitt. They drove him from the
slab with four straight safe pokes in
the fifth and then Jimmy Whalen, the
life saver, was sent in. Jimmy was
given his bumps, too, and the locals fin
ished with runs to spare.
Joe Nealon bumped the ball out of the
lot in the second inning, tying up the
score. The visitors scored three runs in
the third because Walters lost a fly in
the sun and Kane hit Irwin on the back
with the ball while trying to catch him
at the plate after making a swell stop.
The Seals could not hit Charley Hall,
but with so much loose play they piled
up five runs with only four hits. When
the locals began to hit the visitors went
to pieces and all the errors helped. With
two men down in the sixth and the
Seals still one run to the, good, Hart
was walked purposely by Whalen, fill-
Ing the bases and bringing Frick up. He
shot the ball to right field at a mile a
minute gait, putting the locals one to
the good. Score:

TO-L>AYÂ»S GAMES.
. As the high schools of this city are
opening: later than usual this year, the
season will be late. The Alameda High
School has already opened and the
team will have twa.weeJss' start of the
other eleven. McFadden will coach the
team. Ten of last year's team are back
at school. Twenty-one players turned
out for light practice on Monday and
much enthusiasm was shown.
Seven of the Berkeley men who play
ed In the early stages of the Inter
collegiate game last year are back la
college. Five other men who played at
one time or another in the big game
are also back in college.
Stanford has only three of last year's
eleven enrolled this season. This will
not count against the Cardinal as much
as might be supposed owing to the sys
tem employed successfully by Coach
Lanagan last year. In every game play
ed he changed the team's line-up re
peatedly, thus giving every man on the
squad valuable practice. He seemed In
different whether he won the prelimin
ary games or not. When substitutes
were put In they worked as smoothly
as any part of the great machine.
Berkeley, on the other hand, had Its
team selected early in the season and
the Qnly chance a substitute had for
practice was \u25a0when some one was in
jured.
Manager "Pete" Smith, upon whoss
team the college rely for the bulk oC
their practice, will have a strong eleven
this year. Mcl'adden. the former Stan
ford tackle, will probably captain the
team. Kavanaugh and Smock will ba
absentees, although the latter may be
here late in the season.
For quarterback there are two men
available â Monahan, a Southern man,
now at Stanford, and Goshen. Shouchuk,
the Eskimo who played center for the
Carlisle Indians, will coach the Lowell
High School team and Manager Smith
will try to secure him for his team.
Abies, Ktegan and Larry O'Toole will
be available for the guard positions.
Martin, who has played tackle for
two years, will be in his old place.
Long and Elsemun. last year's ends,
will be in the line-up again. Bishop,
the fullback, and Lemon, the halfback,
will also be In the line-up.
Kerns, the University of California
halfback, will play with the team If he
does not return to college. Four men
from the Mare Island Navy Yard, in
cluding a fullback, two halfbacks and
an end will be with the team.
The football players are commencing:
to gird on their armor and practice will
3oon be In full swing On countless grid-
Irons. The arrival of the Eastern
coaches at Berkeley to-morrow will bo
an event. In a short time they will
have their men lined up so that they
may judge the material upon which
they will have to work to develop a
winning team.
The rival fight promoters have taken a
fresh hold and seem determined to land
Britt and Nelson in the ring before the
end of September. Morris .Levy entered
the lists in earnest last night, and an
nounced he had Britt's signature to a
contract to fight before the Hayes Valley
Club.
He sent a representative to Nolan, who
represents Nelson, to discuss a match.
Nolan demanded that an offer equal to
that of $30,000, made by Manager Jim
Coffroth, be made before he would enter
tain the proposition. Levy did not see
his way clear to make sucri a guarantee,
which probably puts him out of the com
petition.
Nolan also Insisted that If the fight be
held in this city that Mechanics' Pavil
ion be the scene, as that is the only build
ing In which a large gate is assured. In
case the Western Athletic Club secured
the fight it was to be held there.
Jimmy Britt Is still at Lake Tahoe,
while Willie Britt is at Santa Cruz. Sam
Berger told Nolan yesterday that Britt
will insist on a $10,000 side bet. Nolan
said he would gladly put up that or a
larger amount if a forty-tlve round fight
is arranged. He said he would not bet It
on a twenty-round affair.
Manager Coffroth signed Buddy Ryan
and Jimmy Gardner to fight twenty-five
rounds at Colma on the night of the 25th
inst. for a $3500 purse. This will be di
vided 75 and 25 per cent. The men are to
weigh 1-12 pounds at 3 p. in. on the day
of the. fight.
The backers of Sister Colette lost a
lot of money in the 2:24 l trot. She sold

feature of the Grand Circuit card at
Kenllworth Park this afternoon, easily
In three straight heats. Sadie Mac was
a $50 to $10 favorite In the pooling.
Four races, were, witnessed by the larg
est crowd which has gathered at a har
ness meeting: here since the old days of
the Hamlin Driving Park.
BUFFALO. Aug. B.â The handicap at
seven furlongs with Pirate Polly, Mrs.
Frank Foster, Oapit'ano and Pipe as the
contenders, was the best race of the day
at Fort Erie. Mrs. Frank Foster as
usual went to the front Immediately and
set the pace for the first six furlongs and
then began to weaken. It looked at the
head of the stretch that Capitano was
coming fast enough to get first money
but Pipe, the outsider in the betting,
came along in the last furlong and won
by half a length from Capitano, with
Pirate Polly third. Summary:

DEPOSITORS STAET
"KM" UPON BANK
DENVER, Aug. S. â Following-dissen
sions 'among the stockholders and ru
mors* arising therefrom, a "run" was
made on the Denver Savings Bank to
day by depositors, who hoped to with
draw their money. After the first
fifteen minutes of business, Vice Presi
dent F. P. Jones, who was in charge
of the bank, announced that the de
positors could withdraw at once j only
10 per cent of their deposits, this rule
being permitted by the law. Jones
said the bank was in good condition
and the 10 per cent rule was put Into
force for the protection of the public.
J. A. Hill, president of the bank, and
L. "A. Imboden. the heaviest stockhold
er, were said to be In Kansas City to
day.
Four times in the last year changes
have been made in the official staff of
thr'bank and it is believed that the de
positors* loss of confidence in the In
stitution is partly due to these fre
quent changes. The last statement of
the condition of the bank, made on
July 3, showed "deposits of $2,034,9a5,
cash on hand and in other banks $586,
344, time loans and discounts $1, 185.695,
bonds and stocks $320,232, and demand
loans $199,501. \u25a0 >'\u25a0â¢;: \

NEW YORK. Aug. 8. â Through the
arrest of Captain Romaldo de Paravlch
of an Austrian line steamship, charged
with bringing over 6SO steerage pas
'sÂ«ngrers for whom there were not regu
lation accommodations. It has develop
ed that ten secret service agents are
traveling for a time In the steerage of
Incoming steamers. Captain Paravlch
was held In cash ball before a United
States* Commissioner.
It appears that the secret service
agents have been going on board at
quarantine and eating the food served
to the steerage passengers, sleeping: in x
the Quarters provided for them and
sharing their* lot in all ways until they
are discharged on Ellis Island. The in
spection is being made under orders of
Nevada N. Stranahan. Collector of the
Port of New York. -This inspection is
in addition to the regular inspection of
the ships which is done by uniformed
officials who board the ships at the end
of each voyage and formally report in
detail the conditions they find to the
collector. j Â£4iÂ£Jgg
Customs Inspector Longstreet alleges
that the ship cammanded by Captain
Paravich was deficient in the accom
modations for eating: for the Immi
grants; that there were no tables as the
laws require. If this is proved the cap
tain may not only be fined $500, but be
imprisoned for six months..
The police learned that Waeber had
tried to get' the check cashed at several
groceries on Friday evening, and had also
asked two men employed at the carhouse
of the California street road at Hyde
street to Indorse it for him so that he
could get it cashed. When searched at
the prison a letter was. found upon him
which he had written to his father. Ru
dolph Waeber, banker, Zurich, Switzer
land, Informing him that he had got Into
trouble over $50 and was to leave the
city for Dutch Guiana., He would profit
by the lesson. Another letter addressed
to "Ernest Rutto. Walsenburg. C 01.,"
was also found in his pockets. ; In It he
wrote that he had lost his Job. after a
terrible quarrel 'with his "boss" and ask
ing Rutto to look out -for a Job for him
as draughtsman.
. Waeber was employed as a draughts
man in the office of H. Barth. architect,
510 Montgomery street. He boarded at
the Hotel Concord, 925 Hyde street, and
owed.?s2 for two months' board. On Sat
urday evening" he gave Mrs. Rose P. Tur
ner, the proprietress of the hotel, a check
for $100 in payment of . his board and re
ceived $45 in change. Thft check bore the
signature of "H. Barth" and was drawn
on the \u25a0 Scandinavian- American Bank.
Waeber left the hotel that night.
' On Monday it was discovered that the
name of H. Barth had been forged to the
check, and the police were notified. When
arrested Waeber admitted that while
Barth was at lunch on Friday he had.
taken a blank check from Barth's desk
and had filled it in for $100,, signing
Barth's name to it but making no at
tempt to imitate Barth's signature. He
had written to his uncle in New York,
who is a ' silk manufacturer, asking for
a -loan of $150, and he was expecting a
reply daily. It was with the intention of
squaring himself with the hotel people
that he gave them the check. He ex
pected to receive the $150 from hig "ancle
before "tha check was . presented at the
bank.
Max Waeber, 22 years of age, the son
of a banker in Zurich, Switzerland, Is In
the City Prison and a charge of forgery
will probably be booked against him. He
was arrested yesterday morning â¢on
Kearny street by Detectives Freel and
Bunner. ,
'"We have found among a. number of un
called-for packages & box containing a suit
of clothes. From a memorandum In one of
tte pockets we beliei-e tne euit belongs to
you. By the terms of the agreement printed
OB the check issued at the- lime this package
â¢wÂ»s left, the charges on eald package now
amounts to f72 60. As the package is In our
wav, however, and as there evidently has
r.een come oversight, you can have the clothes
if you will only call qnlclcly and take them
away."
Captain Dan Thompson of the tug Sea
Rover, two year* ago, bought a suit of
clothes. He selected the cloth with care and
rupsrlÃteaded its construction with watch
ful eye. Trying It oa for the last time be
agreed with the tailor that It was a perfect
it.
v "Shall I meat it bcraer* asked the tailor.
X -Wrap It tip and Ml take it with me,"
- taid Dan, and *he tailor followed instructions.
Captain Thompson carried th* suit to the
tow-boat office and would have taken It home
that evening two years ago, but woe unex
pectedly ordered en a long tow. A friend
dropped In Curing the fiay.
"Her*," saad Dan to the friend, "make
yourself ÃBeful. I don't want to have this
rult kicking about while I'm away. Take It
to the terry news-etand, check it and mail
me the check and I can get the euit when I
com* back." â¢ '
The check nerver came. The friend did not
return. The day after Dan's return he heard
that hie friend bad left for Alaska. Dan ex
rreesed himself, eallor-fzshlon. about the man
who would steitl a fcuit of clothes, ordered
another euit end forgot the affair except at
fuch time as the "friend's" name wat men
" tlormd by come common acquaintance.
"J know him all right. 1 bought him the
suit of clothes he ever had." Dan has
commented more than once during the last
two years.
A few days ago Dan received a letter from
Fettr & O'Rt&er. who manage the parcel
repository at the ferry news stand. Tne let
ter. In (tubstar.ee. was as follows:
Tne rock ana nine iaaen barge from
which the Point Bonita life-saving crew
took its sok occupant late Monday
night was what used to be the river
Eteamer San Lorenzo. The "sole oc
cupant" was Peter Larsen. whose baby
was drowned a few weeks ago when
LarsÂ«n tried to transfer his wife and
family from another barge which he
supposed was foundering in Carqulnez
Straits.
On Monday at dusk the San Lorenzo
with Peter Larsen at the wheel and in
the hold and on deck seventy-live bar
rels of lime and seventy-five tons of
rock, left San Pablo for Fort Baker in
tow of the launch Sybil. The Sybil be
longs to Mrs. Emily Peterson. As
launches go the Sybil is a powerful boat,
but when it came to towing the heavy
laden San Lorenzo it was a case of
sending a boy on a man's errand, a
launch to do work that only a towfeoat
could have accomplished witu any de
fc'ree of safety.
There are two versions of how the
barge got adrift. Larsen's story is as
follows:
U> werv ia m!<l-stream about 9:SO. There
was a strong ebb tide and the wind was blow

bent on aaotht-r and in a few minute* it also
i'ftried. I went forward, got a heavier line
arid toid the launch to stand by to catch :t.

The boj in the launch rÂ«rfu*ed to lake the
"To bell with the barce," he said, and the
;.--.-:\u25a0 *t*rtÂ»-d away.
\u25a0'Take me off then." I asked him.
"To heli wkh you, too. Drop your anchor
and lock out lor yourself. l"m going home."
I h*A only a 30V-pcxmd anchor and oven if
ui&t w^u!a have held the line I had wouldn't,
an'i unyhcw. where he left me I could nut
have found bottom with all -the line there was
un the be:Â«ir. The tide carried the barge out
to tea. 1 could hear \cices a.c we paesed
Lirrse I'cint and I jelled my loudest. When
Â«c got â¢utÂ£idÂ» the barge relied fearfully and
I had tc crawl on my hands and knees "when
I wanted -to Â«et about. I was alraid ibe

The barge was picked up by the tug
fee.a Queen about 1:30 yesterday morn
ing and towed to Green-street wharf,
wjiere she will be held pending the set
tlement of the towboat company's sal
vage claim.
The other version of the abandon
ment is given by H. Tleman, manager
for' Mrs. Peterson. Tieman says:
Larsen Is a common drunk and Rasmussen.
who owns the t.argi". knows It and will make
no claim agminet us. Will O'Brien was in
charge of tte Sybil and he had two gaeoMne
engineer* with him. Wltatever L&rsen says
la Urwn alone. We have three witnesses to
offset any taie he maj- teiJ. We towed the
tÂ»rs* t>Â» Fort Baker. It was fogrgy and the
bay wa* very rough Am thÂ« Sybil was round
ing Uie barge to the line parted. Another
line was bent on and with that the barge was
towed into a sheltered cove where O'Brien
left fcer securely anchored. Larsen was alone
en the barge. There Ehould liave been eight
men on her. Larsen was drunk the time of
U.ex other accident and his being drunk thtn
was responsible for the- drowning of his baby
and the narrow escape of his wife and other
children. We have warned Rassmu6sen that
unless he got rid of Larcen we would refuse
to do his towing, as we could not afford to
take chaaces- with a man like Lerten in
charge of the barge. Larsea was drunk !a*t
r.ight and wu altogether responsible for what
ever happened after the Sybil went away.
Dan Thompson's Old New Suit,
Resolved. That the California State Board
of Trade now declares It to be Us policy to be
hereafter followed and adhered to that It will
not consider matters that are not, directly ger
mane to Its purposes and .itÃ -work, via: of
maintaining an exhibit of , the products of the
State: of collecting data and statistics and dis
tributing tsame for the purpose of informing
homeeeekers and investor*; to conduct a bureau
of free Information for the benefit of all who
seek knowledge of California, and generally to
encourage desirable Immigration and to pro
mote agricultural and mineral development,
manufacturing and all industrial enterprises
that contribute to the upbuilding of the State.
Resolved, further. That this board has been
in the past and is still opposed to any modi
fication of the impost duties upon the pro
tected Industries of California, whether by
way of reciprocity or of legislation..-.
GREAT WINE INDUSTRY. â¢-..;.;;
The Southern California . delegation
consisted of' General S. P. Jennison,
representing the Los Angeles Chamber
of Commerce; P." J. Dreher, representing
the Chamber of Commerce of Pomona,
T. Q. Storey of the Southern California
Fruit Exchange, and W. G. Fraser. of
the Arlington Heights Fruit Exchange
of Riverside. Each and every one .of
these gentlemen spoke emphatically
against giving any sanction to recipro
city because. In their opinion, such
sanction would give to the public the
idea that California is not decided in
its views in favor of protection and be
cause reciprocity, if it should result In
admitting foreign products to compete
with the products of this State, would
be of great detriment to California
industries, which stood to lose heavily
Jf^they had any less protection than is
now given.
Percy TV Morgan, speaking for the
winemakers of California, was equally
emphatic. He said* that $80,000,000 is
invested in "the wine industry of the
State. If foreign wines, by reason of
reciprocity, should be allowed to enter
the United States freely, it would. only
be a short time when, the vineyards of
California would be torn up as un
profitable and a great industry would
be destroyed.
General N. P.- Chipmah, John P.
Irish, E. W. Maslin, Arthur Briggs and
others spoke. Finally "the resolutions
submitted by Briggs were adopted.
Then board adopted resolutions in
memory of Will S. Green of Colusa.
The following were appointed dele
gates to the Irrigation Congress at
Portland: H. D. Loveland, C. M. Woos
ter, J. A. Fllclier, George AJ Dennlson,
. Frank Wiggins and J. S. Emery.
' A banquet will' be given in honor of
Luther Burbank by the board and a
committee was appointed to take that
matter In hand. *\u25a0 ''
"In relation to the proceedings of
the. last meeting of the board in rela
tion to reciprocity with other nations
I. wish to make- a brief statement.
When the report of the committee ap
pointed at the last meeting was handed
to me in the form of a resolution it was
given to the press as a matter of pub
lic interest, but with the distinct state
ment that It would come before the
meeting to-day for consideration. Since
then the committee has withdrawn Its
report and we have now no report to
consider."
The resolutions Introduced by Man
ager Briggs were as follows: .-\u25a0-
Whereas.. The California ' State' Board of
Trade, which was established and has persist
ently been maintained for State development
and not for the purpose or considering general
matters that are only remotely connected with
its special Interest; and, . ...
Whereas. This organization Is. being . con
stantly solicited to. consider matter* of many
kinds that call for opinions on subjects of na
tional character and to participate in move
ments that involve both time and money that
in no wise contribute to thÂ» special work of
the board. It is
At the beginning of the proceedings
Arthur R. Briggs, manager of the State
Board of Trade, introduced the resolu
tions, which were finally adopted wjth
out change, and also made a statement.
Mr. Briggs said:
NO REPORT TO CONSIDER.
Reciprocity between the United States
and European countries found discus
sion yesterday before two commercial
organizations in this cityâ the Califor
nia State Board of Trade and the Cham
ber of Commerce of San Francisco.
The former declared in resolutions
"that this board has been in the past
and is still opposed to any modifica
tion -of the impost duties upon the
products of California Whether by the
way of reciprocity or of legislation."
Tho trustees of the Chamber of Com
merce did not reach any final conclu
sion, but tabled the matter. â¢
Some time ago the California State
Board of Trade gave notice that, it
would to-day consider reciprocity. â¢ A
draft of resolutions that had been sug
gested, was given to the press to at
tract attention and to bring in all. who
were concerned to talk about the mat
ter. That there was a great deal of
interest in the subject was manifested
by the attendance of a delegation from
Southern California cities and also by
the presence of Percy T. Morgan, rep
resenting the wine' interest of the
State. \u25a0 Â» â¢

WACO. Texas. Aug. S.â Mounted
citizens numbering about 600 surround
ed the courthouse and jail at 2 o'clock
this morning, and. after making pris
oners of Shfriff Tilley. the jailer and
all the Deputy Sheriffs, broke open
the Jail. The mob took Sank Majors,
a negro, and, after hearing his confes
sion, hanged him from the new bridge.
Majors had recently been convicted
of criminal assault upon a white
woman and given the death penalty,
but was granted a new trial by Judge
Surratt. in order that there might be
no opportunity for the court of crim
inal appeals to reverse the sentence on
a technicality.

a . wait sharp reactions as well where the

Â«u"gÂ«ting the inference that- the market nad
overrun itself. Nevertheless the character of
trading w*s not sensationally changed from
thft recently prtvailing. There was the same [
* preference for conspicuous specialties as j
against th* standard -railroad etocke. and the
same ecroirigiy obstinate determination on the
T-Art "f holder* to retain these specialties on
nr In prices. To-day's Blight reactions
in ' fact were tromptiy followed by profound
dullness. There was no change in the nature

in the outlook for values heard In the neigh

Â«rwks rose during the <3ay to the highest J
price* in their hiMory and thfe average level j
of the ma.rket usually computed made progress '
toward Us record level, which it Is Mil! consid- j

existing level has much to do with the caution ;

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Aug. 8. â Weakness in the wheat
pit followed a firm opening. . The September
option started unchanged to_.a .shade higher at
SSU@SS%c. Improved .â¢ prices at..- Min
neapolis formed 'the : main source of strength
here. Another factor was rather bullish "for
eign news. Private advices from Paris gave
an unfavorable impression regarding the wheat
crop of France. Reports ' from India claimed
that the wheat crop there was suffering from
lack of moisture. On a rair demand from
commission houses the price of September ad
vanced to 83% c. Free telling by pit traders,
however, caused a reaction soon to about the
opening figures. ' Weather conditions in tho
Northwest were against the bulls, clear
weather prevailing throughout the Dakotas and
Minnesota. For a time the market .remained
fiuiet and steady, but during the last hour pricÂ»-e
yielded to heavy liquidation, sentiment becom
ing distinctly bearish. The principal cause cf
the selling was the report of the weekly crop
bureau at "Washington. Regarding the sprliv
crop th<? bulletin said:
'â¢While rust in spring wheat is more or 1'
prevalent In the Dakotas and to a slight extent
in Nebraska, lowa and Minnesota. repou's
generally indicate that the crop has not aTb
lained serious injury-" /
For September the lowest point of the day
was reached at 52%@82%c. The market closed
weak, with September -Vi@%c_ lower at WUc.
Corn was strong during most of the dax-
September closed %c up at 53% c. '
A firm tone prevailed In tne oats market.
September closed %c up at 26% c. J

had finished my work Coke telephoned
me and told me: that he wished to see
me in my office. I had a patient in the
chair, John Sales, and I asked him to
go into the next room and listen to the
conversation that passed.' 'â¢" ! '
"Coke came in and I spoke to him.
Then Sales apparently went out. but
only Into the next room. ' ! A"~ ' -
"Dr. Dunn told my brother that I should
see Dr. Coke. I didn't see what good it
would do me to see Dr. Coke, for I knew
that he was not a member of the State
board, but I was determined to let no
chance slip by in my endeavor to get a
license, so I went to his office to see him.
"Inmcinf my MurpHae when he told
me thnl he could fix It up for me no
that I could set a llcenite â¢from the
board for $250. 'Why,* I 'said, .'I haven't
that much. la It neceÂ«sary for. me to
pay that ram of money to get the li
cense? Can 1 not paeis the' examina
tions without itr . '
" 'Well, try it and see/ .was Dft
Coke's answer. .
DUXX SAYS, "GO TO COKE."
"Then I went to. Dr. -Dunn. He told
me that -there' was nothing for me to do
but to take the examination in Decem
ber. He offered to help me in any way
that he could. I went away, but sent my
brother, who is an old friend of Dr.
Dunn, to see if the matter . could not
be fixed up in that. way. You see, I had
been out of college for some time and 1
was a little rusty on technical names.
The examinations were only a few days
off.
"Then I wanted to get a license. The
first member of the board that I ap
proached was Dr. Cool, who advised me
to go to each member of the board sep
arately and explain my case 'to them.
meantime I had been practicing without
a license from the State, for I knew 1
was a good operator, although not offi
cially recognized, and I was arrested for
it last winter.
R. H. Farmer, a horseman and broth
er of Dr. Farmer, stated that. he. had
gone to the office/ of Dr Dunn to in
tervene for his brother and that': Dr.
Dunn l&d told him to go and "see Dr.
Coke about it. Coke told him, that the
brother would have to put up $250. ''I
told him that that was pretty â¢, high,"
said Farmer, "arid disked him to give us
professional rates. I did not think at
the time, however, that the money was
to go to Dr. Dunn.". '
The testimony of R. H. Farmer ended
the testimony along, this line. A little
time was taken up by Dr. Fletcher, who
conducts a quiz class for applicants for
a license through the State examina
tions. He said that many of-the.ques
tions in anatomy could be guessed in
advance because' the subject . .' was a
limited one, and that he had guessed
all but three of them in .1902. ; This
testimony seems to; relieve Dr.-May
hew of the suspicion that he gave out
the questions in advance.
The session will be 1 " resumed at 9
o'clock this morning. The testimony
promises to be sensational, as Dr. Coke*
will be called upon to explain his con
nection with the Dental Board.
The next witness was the patient
who is alleged to have overheard the
conversation. This was John* Sales and
he verified the testimony that', -was
given by Farmer concerning the inter
view in the latter's office with Dr.
Coke. Sales swore that Coke told Dr.
Farmer that he had heard" froni, Drs.
Dunn and Cool and that they had said
that Farmer had passed a very: low
examination. He also' swore that: Coke
said that Farmer would better pay the
$250 if he wanted to get. a license. v
BKOTHER VERIFIES TESTIMONY.
clared Dr. Dunn had said thai "the
other would be the surest way" that
member of the board jumped up from
his seat, as though he would strike the
witness. Then he began to play nerv
ously with his hands, and .at length
took to pacing up and down the back
of the room.
MEMBER OF A MARKET-STREET DENTAL FIRM AND A MEMBER OF THE STATE BOARD OF DENTAL EXAMINERS,. "WHO
. ARE ACCUSED BY DR. GEORGE*! FARMER BEFORE THE INVESTIGATING COMMISSION OF- MAKING A PROPOSITION
TO SECURE A LICENSE FOR HIM FOX ?230. '-,/.:-.:' .. -\u0084-;...-.::. â¢
"I am a graduate of the College of Phy
eicians and Surgeons in this city," stated
Dr. Farmer, "and when I finished in 1839
it was not then necessary to pass a State
beard examination. All that was required
was the payment of $10 and the registra
tion of the graduating diploma. I did
not understand the law then, and as I
was sick at the time I went away and did
not return for some months. In this way
I neglected to have my diploma regis
tered, and the first thing that I knew
the law was changed and I was required
to take the State examination to avoid
being an illegal practitioner. In the
FAILED TO REGISTER DIPLOMA.
Dr. Farmer was among the first wit
nesses called at the morning session. The
commissicn was prepared to hear some
startling testimony, for Dr. Cosad had
Siven out the hint on Monday afternoon
and had caused Dr. Farmer to be sub
penaed. Every one pressed forward
eagerly as the unlicensed dentist took
the chair and began to tell his story.
The stability of this accusing evidence
will be tested this morning, when Dr.
Coke will take the stand. He will be
asked to tell his entire connection with
the Dental Board. Following the outside
witnesses, the members of the board will
be asked to testify and Dr. Dunn will be
Â£iven an opportunity to refute the cir
cumstantial evidence piled up against
him. At the present time he firmly de
nies all knowledge of the dishonest pro
posal to sell a license, and says that he
can bring a thousand witnesses who will
twear that Dr. Farmer is telling un
truths.
The first reaJ bomb In the Investigation
of the irregularities alleged to exist in
the conduct of the State Board of Dental
Examiners was exploded suddenly yester
day morning by the faction of the board
known as the "solid live." Dr. George C.
Farmer, a dentist practicing at this time
in San Francisco without a license, swore
to circumstantial evidence which accuses
Dr. J. M. Dunn of complicity In a. pro
posed arrangement to sell him a license
to practice dentistry in California for a
cish consideration of $250. The evidence
also points to Dr. Cool, another member
of the board, as having knowledge of the
affair. .
The offer to sell the license was made
through a third party. Dr. P. S. Coke, a
member of a Market street dental firm,
who has figured prominently through
out the Investigation as one closely con
versant with the affairs of the board,
according to the allegations of the wit
nesses yesterday. Dr. Farmer bolstered
up his statements with testimony by John
Baits, a patient, who heard Coke make
the proposal, and by h.s brother, R. H.
Farmer, who tried to have the price re
duced.
