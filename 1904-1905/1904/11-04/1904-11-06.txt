a great difference between 1 bein* alone

the most lonely .lives, an'i, it makes

a great big family, where all the folks

if that ain't the loneliest place in : all
the 'world- for that one I : miss - my

" "An old maid Is any livin* thing,

pig, or chicken, that's so finicky, so
p'ticular about some one little thing
that don't really amount to much, that
he don't pay no attention to some of
the really important things of life.
Take thu.t cat out there on the fence. I
always call her cy "old maid" cat.
She'll set an' wash her face by the
hour while her five kittens is as thin
an* hunsry-lookin* as rails. If she'd
cet out an' hustle, I'd be inclined to
respect her an' I'd drown some of the
kittens to help her out. but goodness,
thinks I, "God help them that won't
help themselves." I won't help 'em.
An' I've got a hen that takes so long to
find a. place to make her nest that she
don't get time to lay no egss. Then
there's neighborâ well. I won't name

â¢will say how smart he is, but you ought

Guess he thinks it saves plantin' a
willow windbreak back there. Now
they're good samples of the real "old
maid." So you see that Just not bein'
married don't maka a body an "oil
maid." Why, it's born in 'en. As the
book says, "Some folks is born old
maids, some is born widows, an' some
few." mighty few, I'll tell you, "is
born meD an' women." I doa't under
take to explain that about the "wi

as some folks is born so awful finicky
(them's the "old maids"), so others is
born kind o' paiavery. an' soft-saw
dery. a-n' always shinin' up to people.
Them's the "widows." Not that I'd

There's some that's all right, but when

An* don't bother about the dinner.

it's a long ride to town, an* we want to
get married before the parade comes

He kind o" kicked on not comln', but
I'd set my mind on it. an' so he
agreed.
"I'd seen enough of stepmothers an"
boys in my time to know that I wasn't
goin' to. have them boys feel toward
me the way some boys does toward
stepmothers. If they're handled right,
from the start, they can't help but
come out right, an' I made up my mind
that I'd do my best to handle 'em
r'ght. I was sure Jim wouldn't inter
fere, 'cause he said he was goin' to
kind o* leave the boys to me. They'd
had a little too much ,'pa' durin' the
last year an* a half. An' I went into
the thing with my eyes wide open. I
knew if Jim tackled 'em Sunday after
noon after they'd finished that fried
chicken, about bein* married, that
they'd agree, an* it's lcrts easier on tha
father to say nothin* of the step
mother when the children ain't raisin*
objections. Then I depended on the
circus to do the rest. Jim said they
hadn't ever been to one. an' I kind o'
wanted to see it myself, so I didn't
see why all of us couldn't see it to
gether. An* I thought it no raore'n fair
that the boys should have a chance to
see their 'pa' married." Then besides.
everybody knows that If you really
want to get to know a couple of boys,
all you have to do i3 to take 'em to
the circus, or county fair, or anything
of the- kind that's handy. I knew I'd
know , enough more about them boya
after that day was over to more than
pay for takln' 'em. an' knowin' is the
biggest part of raisin', as you'll find
with anything, turkeys, or chickens, or
boys.' . ' ; '
"On the day of the circus, about half
past seven, the three drove up in a
two-seated buggy that Jim borrowed
for the day. The boys was fixed up so
they looked pretty good, an* they was
so uncomfortable they could hardly set
still, for they had on their heavy
woolen suits, an' stiff shoes, for tha
first time In months. I guess. The
boys didn't get out, but Jim came in
an' carried out the big 1 basket of lunch
an' dinner I had already, an' then I
went over the old house just to look
at it for the last time. Ev'rythins
looked kind o* bare, an* the boxes an*
barrels Â¦ made the rcorr.s look kind o'
different, but I wanted to say 'Good-by*
to the place just the- same. Then we
went out an* Jim says to the boys,
'She's the one that's goin* to be your
ma.' I'd told him not to use the word
'mother* to the boys, 'cause maybe
they might want to think of me as
their 'ma.' an* of their dead mother as
â¢mother." â¢ an" there wa'n't no use in
mlxin* 'em right at the*start- I knew
beforehand which was which of the
boys, Jimmie the' oldest,, an* Frankle
the 'Other. I didn't want either of the
boys to ride? in the seat â¢' with' me.
'cause it would, spoil his whole ride, so
I says- to Â¦ Jim. 'Hadn't you better ride
in the back* seat with me. an' let Jim
mie drive? Then we! can talk better."
I- knew the boy was achln* to show off
how well he could drive, an* I knew by
the way he held the lines that he knew
just 'what he was doln'.' Jim always

that day was Wednesday, an' when
Jim begin talkin' about our betn' mar

weeks from the next Saturday, an' that
would give me time to pack up my
stuff, an' give him time to tell hi3
boys, an' to let the hired man off for

to have him around to put the boys

tellln* the boys, I asked Jim to stop at
my house when he went to town the
next Saturday, but not to say nothin'
to the boys about me till after that.
"On Saturday he stopped an* I
packed up a fried chicken I had ready
an* some cake. I didn't send the cake

it. An' I had some rreserves an*
seme other things in the basket. An' 1
says to Jim. 'Now to-morrow is Sun

the day. Now just set this stuff be
fore the boys, an' I guess they'll en
joy it. Then you tell 'em that the
woman that you're goin' to marry sent
that cockln* for them to try. They're
old enough now to have things like

you can go on an' tell 'era that you're

I can see, it came out all right, for
habits is like horses. Them that others
breaks for you ain't half so well broke
R" em you break for yourself."
.CHAPTER IV.
A' Cure for Strikes.
iod. mornin'. Thought I'd Just
in an* set an' visit awhile. Jim had
to come to town to stay all day an' the
boys is off to school, so I didn't have
nobody, to talk to, nor much work to
do.: Work? Why, I've got it all ar
ranged so my work ain't very, heavy.
We don't keep* a girl, but the hired
man's gone now an' there's Just four
of us to cook for. An* the boys helps.
Goodness, yes. \ Before we was mar
ried, Jim an' I \ talked it over. Yes,
I s'pose I did do most of the talkin',
but, anyway, we agreed that the boys
was to help in the house all they could
when we didn't have a hired girl. Jim
said- they wouldri't, but gracious, Jim
don't know* his own boys well enough
to know what they'll do an* what they
won't do. I . never have any trouble
gettln* 'em to do things. So now they're
lots of help.
"I tell you It pays to start right when
you're gettin' married. That's ; one
trouble with gettin' . married young,
'specially for glrlsl They don't know
what they want, nor how to get It If
they do know. But you take a middle
aged woman an* let her get married an*
she's a mighty poorstick- If she don't
. know Just what, she -wants an* get it.
I'll admit "there's/ one advantage in
gettin' married young.- If you're goln'
to be r* happy you'll be happy lots
longer, but then, there's this disadvan
tage, if you ain't goin' to be .happy,
you've, got that much 'more time .to be
miserable In.,' But when you get mar
ried at middle age, if you're goln' to be
happy, you. can be twice as happy,
'cause you know â¢ better how to be
happy- an* you know enough to have
an -easier time 1 , an* If you ain't goln'
to, be happy you won't be quite so
miserable as If you didn't know how to
have an easy time an' you won't be
miserable , so long.
"Yes, I set the. boys to work the first
day. after I came. I told Jimmie he
could help with the dishes an' cookin'
mornin's an' noons the first week an'
Frankie would help at night an' they
could * turn it about the next week.
First thing Jimmie said, 'Why, I never
helped cook In. my life an* I don't like
to wash dishes.'' 'Well,', said I, 'who's
goln* \\xt do > the 'â¢ cookin' an' washin'
dishes when you â¢ boys goes campln'
over to the lake?' Now the boys had
never; been" an' I knew, they was Just
crazy to go^ 'Oh, .ma,' they says, -'can
we go? Goody!'. It was a.day's ride to
the lake an* they couldn't ketch nbthln*
when they did get there, . but gome of
the older boys of the neighborhood had
been several years before an' the younjj
a body can't break a habit himself. I
ain't a-goln".to break it for, him. Oh,
yes, I'll do what I can to help him,
but I won't"' go so, far aa to do the
breakin*.
'.'"Well,. I. smelled, t'bacco; on Frankie's
clo'es one day. an* I knew the time had
come. So that night just before sup
per, .when* he came runnln' in from the"
barn,, I happened to be; In the butt'ry,
so he didn't see. me, an* he spied a,
kittle over the stove, b'ilin' away .with
the cover tight down over it; I wasn't
lookin', so Frankie ups an" lifts the
cover an' sticks his nose I down /.to smell."
Now., of course, I might have put up a
sign,, 'This Here Stuff Is T'bacco, Bein'
Boiled, for Sheep T Dlp.\ but. I didn't
think It was necessary to advertise the
1 actir an' besides, them that keeps thelf
noses out of narrow cracks don't usual
ly get 'em pinched. But Frankie cer
tainly.; got his pinched, or . worse, for
when I come out of that butt'ry, there
he laid oh the floor, with; his eyes
shut, a-hollerin* at the top of his lungs.
I got him fixed up, so his eyes quit
smartln'. but by that time the t'bacco
steam began to get In; its work ah* ihe
was ; Blcker*n ; ever. Jimmle was. ; - Both
of ,'em got the. dose on empty stomachs,
too, 'so v they got 1 It for keeps. You
know desperltV diseases needs desperit'
remedies. \ .
, VSo, I've been a-chucklin' to myself
ever sincer * thinklh' how- them boys
have saved V me ; all the worry about
their; ever gettin 1 - to usin* t'bacco. Why,
they're, .worse ..than Jim, now. They
can't !eyen ride; to, to'wn behind a man
that's ;smoklh' % without bein' sick.
"You know, when r I first said some
thin* to "Jim Â¦'Â¦ about their beginnin' to
smoke, he - says, : \ "Well, I'll < thrash It
out of \ 'eni. iTou just ! let me ketch 'em
usih* thejBtuff.an' I'll fix 'em.' 'Thrash
nothin',' says I, an' I ups an* tells him
'. about"'- anY" old; neighbor of ours years
-ago .that didn't believe "in thrashin*.
He said ' that there wasn't a thing in
this world that thrashl n' /was good for
but Just \ to make young : ones 'go an*
do again the thing they - was bein'
thrashed" for; doin'. Â¦ This ;old man had
so tired an* excited. An' I could almost
guess what his dreams was, for my
head was runnln' over full of pink an*
green girls, an* big bears, an' weddin'
rings. an cute little dogs, an' bands,
an 1 'Get your concert tickets,* an*
-Lemo, lemo, ice-cold lemo!* After
awhile Jimmie dozed off, an' we drove
on In quiet. The teams ahead an' be
hind turned off, one by one, an* soon
we was left alone on the road. I was
half dozln* myself as I hugged Frankie
up close to me, an' Jim was noddln* on
the front seat
"At last, the horses turned out, an'
stopped in front of a gate. Jim
climbed out, â¢ wakin* Jimmie in doln*
so, an* we drove up to a house. Jlra
got out again, handed the lines to JimÂ£
tnie, an' said, 'Hold 'em. I'll be out in
a minute.' He lifted Frankie down, an'
the boy waked up as his feet struck
the ground. Then Jim unlocked the
door, an', scratchln* a match, lit thÂ»
lamp. Frankie. came In with me. an'
with his eyes about half shut, started
for the stairs. As he opened the door,
he said, 'Good night, ma;' then I
heard him stumblln* up the steps.
"I dropped into ,a rockln'-chair, for
I was dead tired. It's no small day's
work for a woman of my age to ride
twenty-five miles, get married, an* go
to the circus all in one day.
"Pretty soon Jimmle came In Just
ahead of his pa, an* dropped his shoes
In the corner, threw his hat oh a chair
an' with the words, 'Goo' night, pa,
goo* night, ma,' he stumbled up the
stairs after Frankie. Then Jim came in
an' dropped Into a chair, an' pulled off
his shoes. 'Well, I guess our weddln'
trlp's over,' he says."
CHAPTER IUÂ»
â¢â¢Desperit Remedies.
"Well," well, I'm glad to see you.
Come right In an* take off your things.
You're lookin' pretty. well. Seems like
I ain't seen nobody for weeks. Just
the boys an' Jim to talk to, now the
hired man's gone. An* the. boys ain't
been Just the most happy folks the
last while. They've been feelin* kind
o* sick. What's the matter? Oh.
nothin* serious. But I've been settln'
here chucklln' to myself Just thlnkln*
how Ihe two o* 'em got their come-up
pance. You know when I came. here
when we was married! . the , boys
(they're fourteen an' twelve), seemed to
feel all right toward me, ! an* called me
"Ma,' an' I liked 'em real welL But you
see while Jim didn't have nobody but
hired men around, the boys had been
kind o* neglected, an* I noticed some
thin*-was up soon's I come here.
"Pretty 'soon, one day I smelled
fbaCcoon JImmle's clo'es. The hired
man wasn't 'here then and the boy
hadn't been off to . the neighbors,
though one or two of . the neighbors'
boys had been over here, an* Jim don't
smoke,, so I knew Jimmle was begln
nin'. : Well, 'I don't know' as you knew
it, but I hate t'bacco. You knew it.
lie, you say? No, not that. It was to
have t'bacco smoke blowed in my ear.
Now Jim don't smoke. He can't stand
the stuff. He got too much once when
he was little.
"Right while I was in the midst of
it came a rap on the door, an* thlnk3 I
to myself, 'There's one^ of those old
peddlers. All week when I've wanted
some new tins they haven't showed
themselves an' now -when I don't want
nobody around an' 'specially when I
don't want nobody to come in that can
smoke, I'll bet he's come.* But It was
JUBt a little neighbor girl come over to
borrow somethin'. â¢ v
"I kept a-settln* there a-howlin* an*
moanin', an* sayin'. 'I wish there was
a man around this place. Nobody to
smoke when I get the earache, an* it's
the only thine that'll cure* it If I only
had a pipeâ but, no, I can't j blow in
my own ear, can I? What am I Â«oin' ;<
to do?* An* â¢ I kept on cryln' ran*
moanin'. Jim offered to " go f or v the
doctor," but I wouldn't' hear to it, an*
began scoldin* about how next time I
got married I was goln' to 1 marry a
man, an* not an old, granny that was
â¢fraid to smoke for fear of smellin' his
breath up. â¢
"Pretty soon I see Jimmy tryin' to
screw up courage to Bay somethin', an'
I says, 'What Is it, Jimmle? j What was
you goin*Â« to say?* He looked- kind o'^
Bldeways at his pa an' says, 'I got a
pipe, but I ain't got no t'bacco.' â¢'â¢Well;
you skip out in the woodshed)' 1 says JU
'an*' you'll find a bag of t'bacco hangln*
on the, rafters, . .the. middle . one. â¢' "I
brought It along for sheep-dip.*
"In a "minute he comes back with the
bag an' a corncob pipe he'd bought off
the hired man. The t'bacco I'd smelled
on his 'clo'es didn't smell as if 'twere
very strong, an' I. thought" he must
have .got hold of . something mlld. : But
there wa'n't nothin* mild about trl*
still* I had out there'in- the' woodshed.
It smelled. like burnih' rubber an" ol'
boots an'.shoein* horses. I wrapped
my head up tight, except just the one
ear, so's ;I couldn't smell the awful
stuff ah' Jimmy started out bravely,
but I wasn't.relleved till' I saw that
the boy was gettin' all he could stand,
an" just a little more. Then I {came
'round pretty- quick: an' flew 'round an",
got the supper an' called 'em In. They'd
gone out to N do the 'chores then. â¢ But
Jimmy' didn't comeJ What was the
matter, you say? Oh, I knew what was
the matter with him,- an' ; soon as I
could, I started oiit to find him.
"I found him In the barn,' doubled up
on a pile of sacks. ' 'Â¦ He'. -'didn't have
strength enough to tell me, to go away,
but I knew he, /wanted to. It '.wasn't
dark yet, so I could still see what i he
looked like. An* I j knew' by his .looks
that the earache wasn't the only thins
that t'bacco had .-cured. I .'never* see
such a lookin*' boy. .; You , know, how
those copper-colored .â¢,:. freckles â¢ of his
would look on ' > a , kind 'â¢ -. o* olive-green
background. * You've heard', of . . people
turnln 1 . green with envy. Well/Jlm
mie's wasn't envy.- . - â¢ Â¦ -
half he' had .was mine an* I wasn't"
goin' to skimp myself an* try to get
along on the butter an' egg money like
so many women do.
"That's another -trouble with gettin'
married young. The poor girls know
how hard up they be an' that both of
â¢em have to skimp an' save all they
can, an* so the fool wife does the house
work, an* makes the butter, an* tends
the garden, an* maybe feeds the pigs,
an' always gather the eggs, an' take3
care of the chickens an' turkeys, an*
picks the fruit an' cans it, an' maybe
helps milk, an' cuts an* husks corn, all
so's to save money, an' how iruch does
her husband skimp himself? He has a
hired man to help him, an* for his wife
to do the cookin' an' washin' for, an*
he works fourteen or sixteen hours a
day. An* he always has money to
spend when he goes to town. But his
wife! How much money does she get
to spend? Just what comes from the
butter an* eggs, an* that she takes to
run the house on. Instead of turnln*
that money into the common fund an*
then drawin" out what she needs, she
gets along on that little egg an" butter
money an* the man gets into the bad
habit of thinkln* that's all she needs.
So it comes harder an' harder to get
anything more than that out of him.
An* by an' by when the children come
there's the children's clo'es, an* her
own, on* dozens of other things, all to
come out of that egg an" butter money.
Well, you've seen so many cases just
that way that I don't need to tell you
about 'em.
"Now I made up my mind that I
wasn't goln' to depend on the egg an*
butter money. That was goln* into the
common fund an* the household ex
penses was comin' out of that same
fund. Oh, it was new for Jim, but you
know there's two times to get a man
to agree to things, an' of course, after
he's agreed to 'em, it's a poor stick of
a woman -that can't make him hold to
'em. One of the two times Is when
he's just married. That does for young
married men. The other time's when
he's courtin*. That's the time to get
things out of widowers. So Jim an' I
Â¦understood Just how things was goln*
to be run before I even set the day.
I told him that when I said what he
should plant on the 'hill forty,* or the
'corner eighty,' he could tell me how to
run things In the house, an* not before.
Henpeckin' him? Not much! An"
besides, If a man is henpecked right he
don't know It an' thinks it's fun.
"Yes, both the boys la in school now.
You thought Jimmle wasn't? Oh, that
didn't last long. Come school time last
month an* Jimmle said he wasn't goln*
to - school. Just had. a girl for school
teacher an* he'd stay out an' help
"round the farm an' then go the winter
term. So Frankie went alone the first
day. The next day was rainy an*
Frankie started out alone. Soon's the
breakfast dishes was cleared up I says
to Jimmle, 'I'm glad it's rainin' to-day.
You can't do anything outdoors, an* I
want you to help me.' It was just
pourln', but Jim had to go to town on
business an' so we was left alone. We
started upstairs to that big room over
the kitchen, you know. It had been
used for a storeroom, an* my plan was
to clean that We moved everything
out an* then we started to scrubbin",
down on' our hands an* knees. Queer
time to scrub, you say? Oh, we never
used to go In there, so It wouldn't get
tracked up, an* I says to Jlmmia.
fortable, an* I noticed, though I didn't
Jet them know I did, how they'd turn
around an* look at me. I didn't blame
*em. I was jjoin\ to study them that
day, why shouldn't they' study me?
If you've got to live all the time In the
same house with folks, it's Just as well
to know all you can about 'em.
"Pretty soon I opened up the basket
yf 1-uneh. I knew they hadn't had
much to cat at home Â¦ that mornin"
Ciufo Jim couldn't cook very well, an*
besides they hadn't had time. An* I
ihousrht they'd better eat now while
they was on the road 'cause there'd be
too much to see after they got to town.
They eat as if they hadn't had a thing
since the chicken I sent 'em. -
"The eircus was at the county-seat,
.\n' I don't believe that either one of
ihe boys had ever been to the place.
Ml the town they knew was Just the
:tt!e village three or four miles away
rrom their home.
"There was Just crowds comin' in
from all directions, so the road got
pretty crowded, but there'd been a rain
the night before so the dust was laid,
an* we made good time.
"After awhile we got to town an'
drove up in front of a store. Jim
wanted to get somethin' before we was
married. I don't know -what, the ring,
maybe. We left the boys settin 1 in
the buggy, an* went into the store.
Thry ha<J plenty to see. an' Jimmie
had his hands full w&tchln' out for the
team. When we got Into the store,
Jim said he wanted to go an* get
Ehaved, but I says. 'No. eir. we ain't
sroin' to wait for that. If you can go
all the time without bein' Ehaved or
havin' your whiskers trimmed, you can
get married without. It's pretty near
time for the parade, an* we'll just
have time to get married before that.
I don't want the boys to miss a thing
that they can possibly see to-day.' I
was glad he didn't say anything while
we was in the buggy about bein'
shaved, 'cause it's just ae well that the
boys shouldn't know how their pa
has to have things said to him once
in awhile. It kind o' keeps their re
spect for him. don't you think?
"The circus was to be at the fair
grounds, an' the minister we went to
lived up that way, so we drove right
up there, an' was married, just the
minister an' his wife an* daughter an'
the two boys bein" there. Then they
asked us to stay there at their house
an' watch the parade from their
porch. It was a mighty good place,
'cause the whole thing had to pass
right by, an' we watched it till it all
got past, then we went over on the
other side of the block an' watched it
come back. I never see Jwo boys en-
Joy anything more than they did that.
We had hitched the team in the min
ister's yard, an' after the parade we
drove up to where the circus tents
was up, to see the man walk the tight
wire, an' to see the girl go up in the
balloon. I thought the boys would go
up, too, an* when we drove over in the
shade of the trees by the fair-ground
fence to eat dinner they couldn't any
more eat than they could Â£y. I made
'em try, an' when they got done there
was sume more of a hole In the big
basket of lunch I'd brought. Jim had
bargained with the minister to put the
team in his barn, so after we'd finished
eatln', he drove off with the team an'
the two boys. I knew they'd rather be
with him, an' I waited at the gate for
'em to come back. They got back
pretty soon, for we wanted to see
everything, beglnnin* a* the sideshow,
an' takin" the rest In order. We was
about the first to go into the side
show, an' we stayed there till we heard
the man callln', 'Menagerie now open
in the big tent* Then we went in to
tee the animals, an' stayed there till
almost time for the show to commence
In the ring. I had told Jim to get re
served seats when we was downtown,
bo we had plenty of time an' no hurry-
In*, an* 'twas worth all it cost extry.
I thought we all might as well be com
fortable, bein' it was the boys' first
circus an* my weddin* day. We Just
got into our seats when the show be
gan. Jim sat on one end of the row,
with Jimmie next to him, an* Frankie
next to me. They hadn't found time to
say much to anybody, either Jim or
me, their mouths was open so much of
the time. I had 'em leave their coats
in the buggy, 'cause it was so hot, but
they had to have their shoes on to
keep from bein' hurt when they was
stepped on. So they was fairly com
fortable.
"We all enjoyed the show. It was the
firet big one I'd ever seen, an' Jim was
kind o" gettin' acquainted with his
boys a little. He seemed kind o'
su'prtned to hear some of the things
Jimmle could tell about the animals in
the menagerie. Read 'em In a book at
school, an' remembered 'em, too. I
thought the boys would split laugbln'
at the clowns, an* I'd set an' watch
the boys half the time, an* Jim some,
an* the show the rest. I see pretty
near everything, but It looked kind o*
different lcokln' at It from the stand
point of a stepmother with two boys
to raise.
"Finally, when the trained dogs come
on, Frankie could hardly stand It I
was lookin* at somethln' goln* on irj
one rlng.-an* Jimmie was talkin' to his
pa, so Frankie, when he see them little
dogs on the platform In front of him,
he says, 'Just look at 'em, Jimmle,' but
Jiinmie was busy, so he turns to me,
'Just lock at 'em.' I was busy lookin'
at somethin' else, so he grabs my hand
an' says, 'Just leek at them dogs, ma.'
That brought me to, an* I turned to
ward him, but I see he'd noticed what
he'd said, an* looked kind o' sheepish,
and didn't look at me, so I pretended
not to notice what he'd said, an* pretty
soon he felt all right again. In a min
ute it slipped out again when he see
he dogs tumblin* an* thought I didn't
ce 'em. I was too busy lookin' at the
: iv.g at my end of the tent but I beard
!Um when he called me that An' after
:hat it Eeemed to come as natural to
::irn as you please.
"After whlle^the men come 'round an'
Â¦was sellin* tickets for the concert after
ihe shew. Jimmie loves music, an' he
asked his pa If we was goln' to stay
for that 'It's only ten cents, pa,' he
says. Jim said, 'Ask your ma," an!
Jimmje turned to me,' an' says, 'Can
we stay for the concert?* I didn't hear
hljr- 'cause I was lookin* hard at the
girl Ewingin* by ber teeth, an' he says
again. 'Ma, can't we Btay for the con
cert r Then I told him, 'Yts,' an' Jim
cot the tickets.
"While we was waltin' after the show
was over for the concert to begin, we
all got up to stretch ourselves, 'cause
even them reserved seats was kind o'
hard, an* when we sat down again,
Jimmie was next to me. He didn't
have much to say while there was any
did you? Wellâ I made up my mind to
let Jimmie break himself of smokin'
Just as quick as I could. Didn't take
me very long either to make, up my
mind how to do it. One - evenln' (we
didn't have no help, you know) one
evenin', Jim an' the, boys Â¦come .h,ome
from work. ' The hired man -was away
for a few. days." They'd been at some
light work; that day, so ; I knew they
-wouldn't be so awfully hungry. But
when they* got home, there I wajB _in
the kitchen, settln' on the * floor,
moanin'- -with the earache. I'd started
to get supper an' had Just got it, where,
nobody else couldn't take hold of . it
an' get nothin'. You know how supper
is,- or any meal. If you leave it at
Just the Tight time, nobody else can't
take hold an' get anything/without
startin' all over again. Well, I'd' just
got to /that time, when -the earache
come on. ; â¢ . '
"The boys come rushih'-.In . soon's
tliey got the horses unharnessed an'
there I was, settln'. on the floor*, with
my head/wrapped up In a flannel rag.
I must have been a sight, but I ; didn't
care, so long as I carried out my^plans:
There I set an' moaned, an* groaned,
an* Jim an' the two boys flew. 'round
like chicken's ! with their heads ; cut off,
tryin' to relieve me. But there wa'n't
nothin' they could do for] me. There
"was Just one thing I wanted; 'Just one
thing I knew would cure trie.'" Sweet
music goin' on, but he talked as fast
as could be whenever there was any
thing else on the platform, an' maybe
it was wrong, but I was always lookin'
some other way or somethin' so he had
to say ev'rythins over an' say 'Ma' to
catch my attention. I kind o*' liked to
hear the sound o' that.
"Well, after while, the whole thing
was over, an* though.** we tried to stop
in the menagerie tent to look at the
animals,, they drove -.us out* of there,
an* we walked down the street to
where the team; was. The boys an*
their pa hitched up. an* we started
home. As soon as the boys climbed
into the buggy I told Vem to take oft
their shoes an' rest their feet, so they
wouldn't be so Bore they couldn't walk
on them next day. Frankie was rldin'
with me. an' Jim and Jimmie was in
the front 6cat The horses was a lit
tle too excited for Jimmie to handle,
an' besides it would be gettln^dark be
fore we sot home, an* Jim would have
to drive then. We opened up the bas
ket, an' the boys ate rwhen they could
find time, between their talks, an' \fe
had a mighty happy time for awhile.
Then I noticed Frankie wasn't sayin'
so much, an 1 I slid my arm around him
where he sat up stjfr an' half asleep.
bobbin* around with -the Joltin' of the
buggy. Pretty soon he snuggled down
next to me an* was sound asleep, an'
I'd feel him sigh once In awhile, he was
"As you can guess, Jimmie wasn't
very good company for several days,
an' he ain't acted Just the same since.'
I think ; it's" ah , improvement- He never
suspected- me, though, an*. I f heard r^him
tellin' the new hired man the other/day
that:,he .wasn't- goin' to .smoke.' "He
guessed If? his pa could !-get â¢ along all
his life . without [ smokin'' he could. An*
he guessed his* pa, was Just as good as
anybody's pa; smoke or no smoke.' Then
I 'knew. he'd, broke., himself. . ; .
"I didn't -worry about Frankie" He's
the littlest one. , He's twelve/ I klndo'
thought when .the time ; . come..; for
Frankie to. learn to smoke I could let
him break himself like Jimmie did. If
not the same way, some other Just , as
good." There's lots of ways for -dolri'
things when your whole heart's set
on doin' 'em'. Now Frankie Is always
snoopin' 'round. . He .'never used to
come into the kitchen when there was
anythln' b'llih' on the stove but what
he'd lift the cover to see what It was.
That is; -when I didn't see him. Of
course,/ he stopped pretty quick when
1 see him.' "Â¦ ';<-. 'â¢â¢ ?Â¦.'! Â».'â¢'.Â«*
"One day about, a week after Jimmle
got his fill of. t'bacco. Jim heard
Frankie tellin' the; hired man that he
bet The could smoke an' not .get sick
like Jimmie did.:. Jim told mean' I
knew it was time, to let Frankie break
himself of the t'bacco habit. ; Of course,
I won't break people of their habits; if
'Thls'll make a fine place to spread out
the feathers from the beds to air while
we wash the ticks.' Well, Just after
w e got started scrubbin I had to go
down an' tend to my bread an' I left
Jimmie down on his hands an* knees,
scrubbin' away. There's one good thin?
about both those boys. Like their pa
in that; if they once get started doin'
a thing they don't stop till they get It
done. I had Just got my bread In the
oven^when I heard a shout outside. I
stepped out on "the. porch an' there was
one of the neighbors' boys on horse
back. 'Got anything to send to the
boys?' says he. 'I've been to town an'
got to go right by the schoolhouse on
the way home.' 'There's Just Frankie,'
says I. 'Jimmie didn't want to go this
term-' 'Oh, I didn't know. I hain't
started yet. Where's Jimmle?' says he.
I told him he was doin' some scrubbin'
for me an' you ought to have seen
that boy's face. It broadened into a
grjn like an apple, cracked in roastln*.
Then he said. 'Well, I thought maybe
you'd been bakin' an* wanted to send
somethin' to the boys. It's quit ralnin'
now. Butâ Jimmie scrubbin'!' An* he
turned that horse an' went off down
that road lickety-larrup.
"Pretty soon down come Jimmie an'
I must say he'd done the scrubbin'
well. I had a good dinner, ready an'
we had a right good time there that
afternoon. It was ralnin' harder again
an* Jimmie read to me while I worked.
Jimmie had rather read any time than
eat, hut they didn't have a single thing
'round that house to read when I went
there. I had some things packed away
in my boxes, though, but I hadn't un
packed hardly anything yet. I got out
some papers, though, for Jimmie an'
he reads fine for a boy that ain't had
no more chance than he has.
"After while Frankie come home an*
If he wasn't a sight! Mud from head
to foot, all over his clo'es, an' all the
buttons off his waist an' most of 'em
off his pants. I asked him what was
the matter an' he said, 'Bill Jones'
(he was the neighbor boy that stopped
at the house) 'Bill Jones come to school
this afternoon an' said that Jimmle,
our Jimmie, couldn't come to school
'cause he had to stay at home an' scrub
the floors. I told him he lied an' he
said he seen him. An' then he tried to
lick me for sayin' he lied, but he
couldn't, an' he's bigger'n me, too.'
"Then Jimmle says, 'Oh, ma, was
that who you was talkin' to this morn
in'? I was goin' to ask you an* I
forgot. You didn't tell him what I was
doin', did you?* I told him I had an'
he felt so bad he almost cried. Just
then their pa come home an' so they
had plenty to- do with the chores an'
unharnessin' an' all.
"Next mornln' Jimmle come In when
Frankie was gettin' ready for school
an' said, "Ma, put up dinner for me,
too. I ain't goln' to have the boys
think I have to stay at home to do
scrubbin'.' I went an' got out a tablet
an* leadpencll I'd been savin* an' put
'em with his dinner pall an' when he
started lookin' for his slate I said,
â¢ 'You'd better not take that. I hear this
teacher's goin' to have a class- in al
gebray. You've been clear through
your arithmetic, hain't you?' ." 'Yes.
twice,' says he. He likes that best of
anything except Just readin*. "Well,
then, If you're studyin* algebray, an' I
guess you might as well go Into the
class If. they Is one, you don't want to
be usin' a slate an' pencil like a primer
class boy. An' I got an old algebray in
one of my boxes . if they use that
kind.' ...â¢:.â¢' \.;; ;-?Â¦" . , . â¢ .
"After he'd got started I called him
back an' told him that seein's the next
week Tuesday was his birthday, if ho
wanted half a dozen of the neighbors',
boys to come an' spend the evenin*, I'd
make candy. I guess they hadn't ever
made much of birthdays.
"Then he started off on the run, to
catch up with Frankie. an' I guess he
run all the way to school, for he was
one of the first ones there, the teacher
told me afterward, an* when she got
there he was holdin' one of the biggest
boys down on the ground (he'd finished
with Bill Jones) an* was sayin", Tes, I
was scrubbin' yesterday an* I learned
how to do it so well that you'll have to
do a lot of it yourself to get clean.'
Then he'd scrub the boy's face with
mud an' fill his ears. That put an end
to the boys sayin' anything about
scrubbin'.
"Well, the next Tuesday came 'round
an' we had an early supper so's to have
time to get things ready, for the boys
was comin' early. Pretty soon they all
come, seven of 'em, three families. Bill,
Jones among 'em. They'd all forgotten
or at least didn't say nothin' about tna
ecrnbbln". | I made candy an* the boys
cracked nuts an* I never see boys hava
a better time. After while Jim .went
to bed an' the boys was play In' games
In the kitchen, so I slipped away. I
come back soon an* when the boys
quieted down after a game of blind
man's buff, I saya, 'Jimmle, don't you
want to show the boy 3 your birthday
present?' His eyes stuck out. That's
so,' says I. 'I forgot to show It to you.
Just go upstairs. The boys can go with
you an* you'll' find It In the old store
room. There's a light up there.* They
all started, Jimmie ahead. I heard 'em
all talkin' all the way up the stairs.
Then I heard the door opened Into- the
storeroom. Not a sound for a second,'
then If Babel itself wasn't turned loose,
I don't know what It was.
"What they saw when they opened
the door was that great big room with
a little flre In the fireplace, an" on one
side of the room was a bed with a rug
in front. In front of the fireplace wai
a little round tabje with a good big
lamp on it all lit an" an easy rockln 1 
chalr beside it. On the table was a
book, 'Ilo\>inson Crusoe,' opened at the
picture of Crusoe's flndih" the loot
print, an" on a little bookcase on the
wall was two or three others, 'Wood's
Natural History.' an' 'Arabian Nights."
an' "Pilgrim's Progress,' an" 'Treasure
Island," an' some old back numbers of
Youth's Companion, sewed together.
Or the floor beside the fireplace was
a woodbox. on one side, on the other
was a box of nuts, with a hammer
stickin' up in it an" an old flatiron
fastened up in one corner. An" last
but the first thing the boys saw, was.
over the fireplace a pair of deer horns
that used to be my brother's, an" on
"em rested the rifle that Jimmie had
been teasln' for so long. Below that
hung a sign, -This room presented to
Jimmle on his fifteenth birthday*
"Pretty soon I heard the door opened
at the head of the stairs an" heard;
Jimmle say. 'Just- look around, fellers
I'll be back in a minute." Then I heard
him come runnln* down the" stairs. He
corne runnin' across the kitchen to
a son named Joe, the laziest boy I ever
set eyes on. He wouldn't work. Money
couldn't, hire him to work, except Just
when he wanted to. "Finally the old
man .says, 'Joe, I'm goin 1 . to make a
gentleman lout of you. Â¦Â¦-. From \ now '"Cn'
you're not" to do one stroke of work,
an' : if- you dp I'll: thrashV 'you;' } Well,
Joe forgqt; that ah' one i day when '.: the
whole farm was hustlin' to get in some
hay before it fained the boy went out
to the* field to help. The, old man" see
him"' at ; work an' he comes down the
field on: the. run. 'See. here,', he says,
!didn't Xtell 'you noV to work ? You'll
spoil your, clo'es" an' get your h'andsall
rough. Remember what I told you?'
An' he took the boy over to the fence
corner; an' if he didn't tan* his hideTll
miss my guess. But It didn't do no
good. Next week his brother an* him
was goln* fishin', an 1 Joe pitched in an'
helped his brother. , The old man
caught him again an' Joe was sore for
a week. -That made Joe mad an' he
began to work on the sly Just to show
his pa he could work if he wanted to.
You know the old 'man would see the
work'- done an' know that the ' hired
man didn't do f it, an' Billâ that was
Joe's brotherâ didn't do it, so Joe must
have done | it, but â¢ he wouldn't j thrash
him unless he caught him at it, so Jo*
got to doin' more an' more without the
old man's flndin' it out an* a boy can
do a heap when he thinks he oughtn't
boys was all crazy to go. Says I,
"What I counted on, was that you. an*
Frankie would learn to cook so that
when you do go you won't have to eat
cold victuals all the time, like the boys
did last time. An' you know the cook's
always boss on a campln' trip. An'
your pa- said he thought in August
some, time you could be spared.'
"Well.' I didn't have no more trouble
with them boys about cookin', an* now
they always, do the dishes. It's all In
gettin' boys started right an' keepin'
them on ; the right, track by keepin'
somethin' -ahead to look forward to.
Only reason any boy ever got off the
track is Just "cause his folks didn't care
enough, or didn't have gumption
enough, to keep him lookin* forward
to somethin? all the time. It's easy
enough to drive a hungry cow behind
a wagonload of feed If she don't get a
chance to ketch up, only you got to
watch out that somebody else don't
give her the feed you ought to give
her.
"Then, too. I been gettin' some new
things, to make my work easier.
Washin' machine, an* flatirons, an' a
lot of things. Before we was married,
when Jim was talkin* about his bank
account, I says, ""When you go to town
for the license, Just bring along anoth
er checkbook." Then when I need any
thing I won't have to ask you for
money.' Course when I got married
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.there's fourteen of us here. That'll
make a good number, an* we can meet
here, in Jimmie's room, just as well as
not.' Then . Frankie broke in, 'An* we
can have it secret an' have passwords
an' grips.' Well, that brought 'em all
around. If you want to get hold of a
boy of the age of them bc-ys, just get
up a club with passwords an' grips, an*
badges, an' maybe a secret whistle, ; an f
if all the boys don't fall over them
selves to get in I'll miss my guess.
"So we organized the club, an' we
give it a name. I can't tell you what it
is, 'cause it's secret, but we, Jimmie,
an' Bill Jones an' me, made out a'con
stitution, an' made nominations for the
officers. Maybe we did have a lot to do
with gettin' it runnin', but somebody
had to, an' I didn't want the boys to
have the idea that the teacher had very
much to do with startin* it. We nomi
nated Eddie Harris for president. He
was one of the quiet kind, but I knew
he belonged to the Good Templars, an'
so knew a little about runnin' such
things. The boys, Bill an' Jimmie.
kicked at givin' it to him, but I told
'em they had to have somebody that
knew somethin' about runnin' things
like that, an' there wasn't nobody else
that knew but the teacher an* me, an'
neither one of us could hold office ac
cordin' to the constitution, nor vote
neither. I kind o* thought that since
we was goln' to have an election" ev'ry
month, some of the other boys might
get it into their heads to run for presi
dent, an' they'd think sines Eddie got
the office by beln' a Good Templar, that
they'd have to join the Temple an* so
learn how to run things. An* there
wasn't one of 'em there that 'twould
hurt to Join. If they took the pledge
now maybe they'd stick to it, an' it
would keep 'em out o' mischief at least
while they was in it. An' I thought
maybe the Temple could hold onto 'em
when once It got 'em, an* that was
worth tryin'. >^;:
"The constitution was adopted just
as w-e had it, an' the officers elected.
Then the teacher said since we didn't
have anything in the constitution
about badges, he'd like to furnish 'em
for the club. Since we were to. study
birds, an' such things, he knew of
something that would be all right. It
wasn't anything to wear, but we could
carry 'em in our pockets, an" he didn't
think anybody else would have any
like 'cm around here. The boys all
cheered him at this offer, an* then I
made another suggestion; Says I,
"We've made our plans for a weekly
meetin' for Friday nights. Why can't
we have what we might call a field
meetin' Sunday afternoons from three
to five? Most of you will be through
your dinners after church and Sundey
school by that time, an' It'll give us
two hours in the woods an\ fields, an'
let you all get home in time" for the
chores. The teacher can tell. us about
the things we see, that; we -don't know,
an' we can start from here.' They all
finally agreed, though some of 'em
thought their folks might object; but I
knew If the folks thought they Â¦ was
with the teacher an' so long as they
wasn't around- in the way at home
those Sunday afternoons, . it wouldn't
make no difference to . the folks where
they was. Then the teacher said he
could have the badges ready for Sun-,
day, 'cause : he was goin' â¢ to town the
next- day.' â .
"It" was pretty late that - night ,wh.en
the meetln' broke up. Must ' have been
eleven, an' i I Â¦" told * the boys to say . to
their folks that I wouldn't let Â¦ 'em. stay
that late again. -An'. I warned 'em not
to let .out the secrets "of the I club; an*
so they went home feelln'j as big, as
could be, the whole eleven of , 'em, the
teacher feelin' good Â« over; the! different
way the boys treated him, an*, the boys
all proud of bein'. In - the club '-, right
from the start, an' plannin' on things
they was goin' to do. V .*.-â¢
"All the boys was , on hand ; Sunday
afternoon," an* It was : a beautiful day.
We spent two hours In , the ;â¢: woods,
studyin' empty birds' nests, an* tryinVto
see how: many of 'em we could -tell by
the way they looked In winter, 'â¢' an', the
teacher gave us all our badges. - He'd
collected . different ; kinds ': o' coins once,
an' A he "had a lot' of I those * old white
cents : with . anTeagle < on ,'em.' '.You * re^
member .'em, 'don't" ; you? ''Bout 'war
time, â¢ I- guess. An" he give ; each of us
one. of ,'em.. .Only, one of the ; boys; had
ever seen one of 'em, an* .'they! was all
as careful .of 'em.^An', some of the boys
was tellln' . about _"- brothers i that ; was
comlnVto school next week, an*. wanted
to join, but ; we'd set ' the * limit" on" num

other three. * ' . ; : -
.''On jMonday^ m'ornln' â¢ Bill -Wood*: an*
Jack Smith showed '.. up at school ' about
half-past ten,*. an' ~ tried i toV.take> the
back . seats * Just \ like - they ! always had.
"At supper an* after supper I kep'
him a-talkin* on outdoor things, an' he
seemed to know all about how things
lived an' I could see plainer than, ever
juet how he was goin' to win his way
through that term of school.
"The next day after he an* Jim had
started for town, I got Jimmie to tell-
In* about the carryin'-out the year be
fore. He didn't see it nor Fiankle
either, 'cause they had the mumps
then, but he knew all about it, an' it
was just as I thought. Bill Wood an'
Jack Smith always came late in the
mornin' an* if the teacher said any
thing, they sassed him, an' finally they
got all the other boys to help carry
him out an* to keep him cut for one
day. That broke up ths school. Jim
mie said that. those biggest boys was
goin* to start a week from the next
Monday, an' so I arranged ray plans.
"The next week I told Jimmie . an*
Frankie together to ask all the boys
In school that was thirteen err over to
come to our house on Friday night to
make candy, an' I sent a note to the
teacher, too, askin' him. I didn't tell
Jimmie that I asked the boys so" they
could get acquainted with the teacher,
'cause there wasn't no use of scarin*
'em away. They was all glad enough
to come. Ever since Jimmie's birth
day he'd had more visitors, an' the boys
always seemed to think I was different
from their own folks. Of course I was,
but their folks ought to have had sense
enough not to let 'em find it out. It
don't pay to let your boys get to think-
In' you ain't quite so good to 'em as
somebody else's folks is to them. But
most of the other folks never thought
anything about tryln' to keep the boys
at home, an' was glad enough to get
'em off out of the way.
"They all came, every last one of 'em,
on Friday night, an' the teacher, too,
but they shut up like clams, an' so did
he. They didn't have much to say till
we got to makln* candy, an* then I got
him to tellln* about how diflerent kinds
of sugar is made. The boys got kind o'
Interested, an* when he switched off
from that an* began tellin' 'em about
some fun he had one spring makin'
maple sugar In the big woods over be
yond the county-seat where the wolves
still howl at night, an* the farmers
can't keep sheep at all, on account of
'em, I saw he had the boys where I
wanted 'em. Pretty soon he mentioned
the birds in the woods insugar-makln*
time, an* I broke right in. I hated to
spoil his story,, but this was just the
chance I wanted. I asked some kind o*
foolish questions. You know a man
never feels like tellln' a woman any
thing until she shows how big a fool
ehe can be by askin' questions -that
don't mean anything, an' then he ex
plains in a toplofty, way. Well, I
wanted the boys . to combine .with the
teacher answerin' me, an* I -got Just
what I wanted, for they all begun to
talk at once, an' went on namin'" birds
that stayed all winter, an' got. all
TKorked up. ; Then ; I "Â¦ got ,'em switched
off to * somethin' else, an' the "Â¦Â¦ teacher
got started on that, an' they were" all
breakin' in : an' askin' ; questions, an*
generally feelin' good - an' friendly
when I sprung my plan.^QHMBHH
"Says I. 'Why, these are all new
things Â¦ to me. An' to most ; of :; us; I
guess. Why can't we have a little club
to meet here Â«â¢ Friday Â¦Â¦ nights; an' talk
over, this kind o' things? Le's see,
btg as ne was, an' he didn't look as if
he had any too much strength for his
size. But Bill an' Jack hadn't started
in to school yet. They never did till
after the others had got nicely started.
Then they came In an' kept the whole
class back till they got ready to bust
up the school, but when I see him a
comin' aio-ng with my boys, not lookin'
much bigger or older than Jimmie, I
just made up my mind that he was
goin* to teach out the term if anything
I could do would help him to do it, an'
I was pretty sure L could do somethin*.
"I waved to the boys (Jim hadn't got
away with all the cookies) an' they all
climbed over the fence. I shook hands
with the teacher an' then gave 'em all
a cookie apiece, an' that boy looked as
pleased as our boys did." We was
standin* there talkin', an' Jim had just
thrown down the last shock when I see
a mouse run across the ground under
where the shock had been. The teach
er saw it an* quicker'n I ever thought
he could move he'd dropped on the
ground in front of it an' caught it. He
looked up at me from where he was
kneelin' an' says. This Is "a new one.
I never saw this kind before.* An* then
he went on to tell an' show all about
the little thing, that laid tremblln* In
his hands. I could see the boys was
interested, an' 'specially Frankie,
whose eyes Just shone, as the little
teacher went en to tell how the mice
lived in the summer an* winter, about
their nests, an* what they lived on. an*
how their enemies chased 'em, an' be
fore he got through, the whole plan for
breakin' up the carryin'-out scheme
came to me. The boys hadn't- talked
much on the way home. Didn't have
anything to say to the teacher, an* he
felt a little shy at goln' to a new place,
but now, the three were as friendly as
could be, an' we all had a Jolly time as
we went home to supper on the big
wagonload of corn.
but the teacher tol&.'em if they, came'
late they'd have to take seats farther
front, 'cause the back seats was taken
by them who had been there right
along. They wasn't ready to; do their
mean tricks the first day, so they took
seats farther front, but they tried^their
best to ; stir things . . up' all -week.
Luckily It: rained one or two days 'an'
they never": pretended :' to go;to*school
except~ln nice weather, so the teacher,
didn't have them to bother him all the
time. They tried to lead the other, boys
around like they used to, but they 'all
had so much to think about with their
club plans,- an' showln* each other their
badges, an* givln* the "grip, that they
didn't have no time to bother with
these big bullies.
"On Friday night we laid out the
work for the club for the winter. The
teacher an' I had kind o f taken that in
hand, an' each of the boys, or some
times two together, had somethin' to
work up. Bill Jones an' one of the
other biggest boys had a list of all the
birds they saw in the school district in
December; another two had to make a
list "of all the trees In a little grove
near the schoolhouse, an' so on. An'
the teacher told 'em that he'd met a
friend in the county-seat the Saturday
before, ah' that this man was goln' to
s'prlse the club with somethin' if they
kept runnin' In good order for a month,
an' did good work.
"On Sunday, afternoon we had a big
storm, so we had our field meetln* in
doors, an* most ot the boys was there.
"On Monday the big boys who wasn't
members : of the club tried to stir up
the club members, but the"y couldn't
make any : headway at that, an' they
didn't have nerve enough to carry out
the teacher alone, an' they wasn't isure
the boys. wouldn't help the teacher in
stead of workin' against him, so they
wasn't very good-natured an' handled
some of the little fellows pretty rough
on . the way home that night.
"On Tuesday , night both of our boys
come home lookin'-. as if they had been
run through a thrashln' machine, an*
when. they got over. their excitement ao
they could tell about it, this Is what we
heard:
"At recess that afternoon, when some
of: the club boys was off in one corner
talkin' about club plans, an' showin*
their badges, an*, tryin* the ' grips, Just
to; keep 'em In mind, one of the big
boys that - had Just come to school
walked over to the crowd of club boys,
ah\J plckln'i out: the "; littlest - one, ' that
happened to be Frankie, he began goin'
through his pockets, an' after flndin'
the eagle cent, he ; put it in his pocket
an*' walked: off. Now Frankie ain't
afraid of nothin' that walks, an* while
I don't believe in boys fightin', I'm glad
he ain't. So Frankie, just as the fel
lerstepped out ;the door, run ah'
Jumped up on his back (he wouldn't
have caught him that way If he could
have got him any other)," an down they
both Went, : the" thirteen -year- 1 older, an*

the", other , big . boys, not club : members,
come, :' too, 'i an' ; then all the club . boys
come, an* one other outsider, an' they
: had it hot an' heavy there for a while.
The teacher tried to stop 'em/ but' there
wasn't | any stopping till those I three big
fellows; ; all' that; there was' there '- that
day, was so" completely licked that they
sneakedy off home,;.: givln' Frankie's

published soon.
"An* our Sunday field days was just
fine, an'I learned a lot about weeds in
winter, an' birds in winter, an' mice,
an' all such things, in winter, an' boys
all the time. Just from trampin' 'round
the fields with that club, an* when
along in January the teacher told us
one night that he wouldn't be with us
after that term as he had a school
nearer home that paid better for the
next term, but he'd be willih' to come
out for Sunday afternoons If the boys
wanted to keep up the club, of course
they did, so we're goin' to have our
club meetin's all spring.
" "An'- the last day of school, we're
goin'., to. have the first exhibition
they've had in 5ur district since eight
years ago. Couldn't have no exhibi
tion last days when the last days de
pended on . the time the teacher got
carried out. But now, the G. O. C. of
the Sixth School District, Town of
West Grove, will have full charge of
an annual exhibition to be held at the
schoolhouse of that district on the third
Friday In February, an' I wanted to
ask you to come out to visit for awhile
an' _be there for that. Mr. William
Jones is president of the club, an' has
charge of the affair, an* our Jimmie is
goln'- to be on the programme. It's all a
secret yet, but you'll like It. Maybe I
did plan it, now you say so, but don't
you think a mother ought to have a fin
ger in the pie?"
CHAPTER VI. -
- Manasin' Jim.
. :."Why, how do you do? Ccme in. It
seems good to see somebody agalnrnow
that Jim an' I's all alone. Oh, yes,
we've been that way ever since school
started up In town. An' we don't have
the hired man in. the. house any more. \
I tc-ld Jim' when we was first married
that I thought It was better to get a
. hired man that was married an* let
him live In the old "house on. the place,
than to. have a happy-go-lucky, here
to-day-an'-away-to-morrow young fel
low, : that , never would be around when j
-we wanted him, an' would always be
puttin', the boys up to tricks," or leadln'.
, 'em;; Into mischief of ; some kind. An'
when I reminded him that the boys got
to smokln* from the > hired man, he
agreed .with me," so now we have an'old .
settled-down' married man,' an' it saves
my .work cookin', for an.extry one, an*
then , there's - a ; good Â¦ workin' woman
handy If , I : need anybody to help with
the work. Of course it costs 'â¢ a little
;more, an', the older -man maybe can't
.get quite so much work done, but what
he; does do better done,' an' it | makes
lots of difference with the boys about
meanness, an*- gettin' bad habits. Â¦
"But we don't see enough 'of 'em now
-*â¢ so we can tell whether : they're â¢ any
meaner, or not. They're away from
Â¦ Monday mornin* till Friday 1 night.ev'ry
; week.' - 1 had t a nice job gettin' Jim to
let ; 'env go,' but ; they're â¢ goln', an* he's
Â¦ as * proud * of .'eni ' now.' as .can be. - You
see when the school started this fall at
. home J here," I > made up my mind i there ;
" wasn't : no ; use I of â¢ the nboys ; goln'. t Our
. country, schools . don't amount to much,
4 an' s -"of ; course ';vre ' can't : expect . 'em r to '
when ,we don't -payi no j kind lo'- wages.*
Teachers don't -get : much more 'â than
enough to pay, their, board," an'.: so ; any
body that's any, good as a teacher; like
the man', we had last winter. Just quits
; anVgets a town school some where." An'
then; when ! boys , gets : along , to fourteen
? an 5 sixteen r like -Frankie r an' v'Jlmmie,
they * learn I lots r^more ] :', meanness > than
anything ', else. S Of * course, * they, have
time to, , 'cause them that's regular has'
toVwalt an', drag; along for". them j that ;
stays out half the time, so it's just as
- well Â¦ to get the boys into town ; school
"1 where they'll have to hustle to keep up.
iThe main worth' of goin'- to school any-
"I didn't say nothln* more about the
boys goln' to' school. I'd started the
subject long enough ahead so we would
have plenty of time to settle th? thing
before school opened, but the next day,
when I did the bakin' â¢ for the next
week,' I cut" down on the cake and
cookies, an' everything except Just
what we had to have. When we came
to set down to the table to supper there
wasn't any cake, or any preserves, the
first time at supper we hadn't had both
c-n the table since we was married.
Jim looked kind o* red when I told the
boys, when they asked if I hadn't for
got somethin', that, their pa had Just
been tellin' me about some plans for us
all that he was makln*, an* if they wa3
to go through all right, we'd all have to
help, an* the best way we could do It
was ta cut down on things like . cake
that take so much butter an' so many
eggs. The boys wanted to know what
it was an* I told 'em ; about the farm,
not the school. â¢ Frankie didn't look
very cheerful at the Idee of havin' a
farm of his own. ; He hates farm work,
an' it don't seem: as. if he can ever do
any work right in the field, but you let
him doctor a sick chicken, or a - calf,
an' he's perfectly happy. I told 'em
that I hadn't known. till Just a little be
fore about the plan,. or I. wouldn't have
been so reckless in cookln', an* I went
on talkln* about hew nice it would be
for all of us to work together savin". It
wouldn't be so hard on any of us that
way. They agreed to it, an* seemed to
stand goin" without all right, but Jim
never j seemed to , get enough to - eat
without just' the things that we didn't
have on the -table <Â¦ any â¢ more, so he
didn't get. along so well as the boys.
"Then on Friday mornin" Jim said to
me, 'Hadn't you better bake , to-day so
.we: can go to "town- to-morrow?* .'I'd
made * him > understand before this that
If he" planned on my; goln' to' town on
Saturday, - bakin' ; day, he'd . have to let
me know beforehand that .we was goin'
so I could do my bakin* Friday, though
â¢ my .work was . lots lighter., now that I
didn't'have cakes ; or pies: to "make. .Â¦ I
told him I couldn't afford to go. . Says I,
'If I go now," I'll have to have the. hired
; man's wife . to", help ! me get the work
done next ; week. anV we can't afford to
hire.' Jim didn't say ; no more. Â» but' he
stayed * to home - himself : on : Saturday
an' . the boys : had to : stick ', pretty close
to-. their work , that ; day. . On Saturday
night â¢ I .counted ;up xwhat we saved ; by
goin' 1 without \ some of the- things, ; an',
the - boys : looked as 4 If : they ? felt i pretty
*- **An* then I wanted 'Jimmie to see a
little bit of town life so he'd feel how
much better the country was, an* want
to stick to the farm. He's just fitted
for that. Frantie always said ever
since ha was a little feller that he -was
goin' to be a doctor, so I knew he ought
to have a? good a chance as he could
so's-to gÂ£t aheart the faster.
: "But Jim kind o\ balked. when I sug
gested it. Of course, we was alone
when ' we talked the thing over. We
agreed when we was married never to
talk anything over before the boys that
we might disagree , on, without havin'
It settled beforehand, 'cause I didn't
think it was a good thing for them to
hear any arguments we might have. If
they sided with their pa, they'd think
I was stubborn, an* if they sided with
me, an* I knew they most always
would, they'd think their pa was stub
born. So it was fairer to their pa than
to me.
"Well. Jim didn't think he could
spare the boys. It would mean hlrin*
another hand, an' then he couldn't
spare the money. Board In town cost
ready money,' an* he didn't have any
too much. An" besides, he was plannin*
on buyin* the 'joinin' farm as soon as
he could, so the two boys could each
have a good place when we stepped
out. I could see he wasn't to be con
vinced, an' I never waste words argu
in\ Thinks I. 'Words is just words, an'
when you've said- it. why, you've Just
said it, an' it's got to be done yet, but
if you do It. why, then it's done." So I
told him I didn't think he'd treated me
fair in not lettin* me know he was
countln* on buyin* . that place. Of
course I did know it, though he hadn't
never told me. 'Taln't Just the things
that a man tells a woman that she
knows. If It was. we'd all be the big
gest know-nothin's you ever see. But I
wanted him to feel that he hadn't been
fair, an' I told him I could have helped
him if I'd only known It. I hadn't been
near as savin' as I might have been,
an' ev'ry cent counts twice when It
comes to savin*.
way is tha hustlin' to keep up. It never
dees -the boy any good, to go to school
that's away ahead of his classes an*
has time to set an' plan deviltry. Of
course Frankie an* Jimmie are bright
enough, but they haven't had the regu
lar work like they get in town, so
they'll have their hands full.

CHAPTER V.
A Finder in the I*ie.
'Good afternoon. Yes. I've corae to
Bpend the lime while Jim does some
buyin he's got to do. "Why, I ain't seen
you fcir.ee away last fall, when I was
h-ro Just after Jimmic's birthday. An'
there s so many things happened since
then that I dor."t know just where to
Lcsin to tell you about 'em. But I'll
begin with our school teacher an* the
Viiy things has be*-n goin' at schooL
â¢Â¦1"<ju know we had a girl teacher last
fall en' b -nil the boys went an* they
Â£ut Z'j they iiLeii her pretty v.ell. This
winter ve gux a man teacher, couldn't
have u girl 'cause the school has al
ways been so tough. Why, ev'ry win
ter till ihis one for a long time the
teacher's been carried out an' that al
ways broke up the school. An* I
fc'l>oEe if it hadn't been for me the
school would have been busted up the
same way this winter. But it wasn't.
1 made vp my mind that cmr boys had
lest enough schoolin' just through the
meanness of some of the big boys an'
tiree they have only seven months in
the year, take it all in all, there's no
use of their losin' any of It. An* then
it ain't very good for the boys an' girts,
even if they don't have nothin* to do
with the carrytn' out. Just to see things
smashed up the way they usually do.
I know I don't want Jimmie an'
Frankie to see any more of that kind o'
rumpuses. They're just old enough
now so they're likely to get the notion
into their heads that any property,
just 'cause it don't belong to any one
man, ctn be smashed up without it
bein' wrong, an* I don't intend they'll
cce any cf that scrt of thing. They're
pretty tvillin' to stay at hctne nights,
noV Jinmie has his room just ths way
he wants it an' they have plenty to
read. An' if they stay in nights, then
school is about the only place for 'em
to learn devilment an' there's no need
of 'cm learnin' it there. I told Jim
right at the start that our boys was
goin' to stay at hcnJe nights unless we
went out together. It's juat as much
fun for the young folks if they an"
their folks goes together if only they're
used to it an' it's lots better for their
bringiri' up.
"As soon as school started, I began
cskin* the beys about the teacher. I
wanted to know what kind of a man
he was. It makes lots of difference
how the boys h&s to be treated at home
if you know how they're treated at
EchooL An* it pays for the folks to
know the teachers they get for their
youngsters. A real good man can do
more harm in a school with his goody
goody ways, if the folks at home don't
know how to work against him, than a
common ord'nary man, bad as he may
be, that's real wide-awake, an' up to
a!l the young ones' meanness, than any
c-f your good, meek, half-asleep kind,
that cer.'t know how' to handle the
boys, an" thinks they're all as good as
he is. The boys will get more real
meanness from tryin' to get ahead of,
an' gettin' ahead of, this kind, than
they'll ketch frcm. one of the other
kind.
"'Art' it pays to know the teachers for
other reasons. Maybe the teacher will
set in a fix some time an' just need
somebody that Is on the outside lookin"
en, to tell him a thing or two, an* it
don't never hurt a young man to have
eomebcrdy older to give him a word or
two cf advice. Of course, the advice
has got to be give to him in a nice
little capsule of Cattery or a sugar
coated pill, like other bitter medicines
is gix-e in nowadays.
"Well, all I could find out was that
the teacher was one of those young
men who was savin' up money to go
to school on, goin* to be a doctor, an'
echocl-teachin' was the only Job he was
fct.-crg enough to do an' the quickest
way to save xip money. He wasn't
very big, an" he wasn't the kind of a
man that can bluff cut a crowd of
grea.t big husky country boys, so I
kind o' feared for him. He lived over
to the county-seat, en* couldn't get
home at all except when some farmer
from our way was goln* in on a Satur
day. I pumped the boys ev'ry eight,
an' tried to piece together all I could
hear. I couldn't make much out, an'
to I made up my mind I'd see the fel
low. On Saturday Jim was goln' to
town to the county-seat, eo I told
Jlrr.mie Friday mornin' to tell the
teacher that, if he wanted to go, he
should come over to our house an' stay
all night an' go In with Jim the next'
day. I reckoned I could get pretty well
acquainted Trtth him in one evenin', an*
then I wanted our boys to get to know
him better. I might have had him to
board at our house, but there's such a
thiiig as knowin* the teacher too well,
ax* I didn't want our boys to do that,
eo I eaid I couldn't board him, an' be-
Eides I didn't want the Job of boardin'
another an* puttin* up a separate din
ner ev'ry day. This havin' the teacher
around may be all right, but it ain't
fat the same as bein" alone, an' the
boys get to knowin' him too well, an*
he knows them, an* they feel that he
knows all about when their pa
thrashes 'ern. That's other folks' boys
v/here the teacher boards, not ours,
'cause ours hain't needed It eince Jim
an* me was married. An* it kind o*
hurts a boy's pride to have his ma pet
him when the teacher Is around, an*
yet he ought to have a certain amount
of pettln'.. So I didn't want him as a
regular boarder, but I knew I could
get to know him pretty well in one
evenin', an' I thought after one week
of school he'd be about ready to let
out, 'specially when it was the first
time he'd ever been away from home.
"On Friday afternoon, Jim was out
In the field huskin' corn. It was the
fint week in December, but It was
pretty fairly warm, an* he didn't have
much left to do. Got most of It done
in the warm weather In October, but
rains come on, eo he had some left. I
went out to take him some hot cookies
right out of the oven. He does like 'em
eo well, an* there he was, all alone, half
a mile away from the house, an' it
wasn't the warmest work, huskin' that
frozen corn, either. â¢ No. I don't usually
bake Friday afternoons, but I hadn't
noticed that the cookie jar was empty
till after noon that day, an' the boys
always look kind o' as if they was
cheated If they don't find plenty of
fresh cockles in the Jar when they
\-isit it when they think I don't know.
An' I don't see no use of disappointin*
â¢em. They'll have disappointments
enough in this world later on, without
their havin' too many now. an* I ain't
coin* to disappoint 'em needlessly, eo I
baked later than usual. '. Â¦Â¦
"It was after four before I started
out, an' I stood there talkin' to Jim for
come time, an' after while I see . the
boys e-comin*. There was a little slen
der fellow with 'em, that I knew must
be the teacher, an* I thought to myself,
'How long will he last when Jack
Smith an* Bill Wood start In to school?
Why, cither one cf them was twice as
"I didn't see nothln* of Jim all after
noon except when he come in from ths
flew an hitched up the team an'
drove over to the neighbor's that owned
the farm that he was countln* on buy
: Â». H f ot baek * ust before sapper.
an JÂ»e looked a little less grumpy than
he did at noon. We sat down to tho
table, an* It did look kind o* bare with
out cake or cookies, or sauce or pre-
"At dinner he didn't say no more
about the thing 'cause the boys was
around. Of course, if he'd asked me
I d have told him that it was a waist
that I was makln* for myself, though I
might not have told him I was makin*
it Just to wear to that Old Folks* pic
nic. But I was. Just the same. But he
dldn t ask me. an* he kep* on gettln*
more an* more stirred up about my
sewin* for the neighbors, Jnst to save
money so as to buy another farm. If
he'd seen the goods he'd have known.
If he d been a woman, that I wasn't
sewin* for ills' Jc-nes, for she couldn't
wear that color, but he didn't see the
goods, an* If he had. bein* a man. he
wouldn't have thought about snch a
little thing as color.
"Jim didn't say no more about the
picnic then, but he wasn't quite the
most pleasant person to live with all
week. Seemed as if cake an* preserves
an* such had been keep in* him sweet.
On Thursday mornin* he went to town
on business. After he was gone, I'ftxed
up a bundle of dress goods an* went
down to one of the neighbors. She had
a waist pattern that I wanted to use.
an* she was pretty clever at cuttin*. out
dresses. I always make my own
waisu. but I can't never get the skirts
to hang right, so I hire them made.
Change work with this neighbor, or
somethln*. When I got the waist cut
out I started home, but I wasnt goln*
to lug that bundle back through, the sun
an* dust, so I says. Til leave this here
an when Jim goes past you send it up
by him. Just say there's the stuff you
said you'd send up.*
"Well. I got back an' started dinner,
an after while Jim come dxivin* up. I
went out to meet him. for I needed
some of the groceries he had. an* he
handed down the bundle. He looked at
me kind o* quee^ an' says, 'What's
this? Mis* Jones said to tell you It was
the goods she was goin* to- send up.' I
said, "Oh, Just some sewin* I'm gotn' to
do.* He looked mad. an* asked. 'You
ain't doin* any sewin* for her. be you?
You needn't think you're goin' to take
in sewin' !' An* he started to take the
bundle out of my hand, but I walked
into the house. I knew he'd been
thlnkin' all the way up to the house
that somethin* was wrong wtth that
bundle (it would take him about that
long to get as stirred up as he was),
an* I was Just as well pleased that he
rtui think I was sewin' for the neigh
bors to save money for that 'Jcinin*
farm, even if it did hurt his pride to
have his wife take in sewin'.
happy over It, but Jim didn't even
thank me for tryln* to save.
"Just a week from the next Wednes
day came tbe.OJd Folks* picnic at tho
county-seat, an* Jim, I knew, was plan
nln* on goln*. He hadn't never missed
a picnic since they started havin* 'era
fifteen years before, an' when he men
tioned it to me that Saturday night, he
looked kind o* surprised when I told
him that I'd planned on' doin' some
coiorin* that day. that bein* ths only
day I could borrow the bis kittle an* I
couldn't afford to hire the colorin* done.
An* besides. I didn't think we could af
ford to go. We couldn't go without tha
boys, that was understood. Why, it
meant the loss of the work of foor an*
the team for one whole day if we went,
an* ev*ry cent counted toward that
â¢jqinln* farm.

He would try to drink some /of the
coffee, which couldn't have. been very
hot. 'cause it didn't steam like It,' an 1
then he'd draw a long breath; an' try,
one of the biscuits. That seemed to
just about, let me see, fifty times three
hundred an* sixty-five. Is about eight
een thousand, and three meals a day is
about somethin' over fifty thousand.
I'd worked it out beforehand, so I had
it all' ready. - I watched him close when
I said that about settin' down to the
breakfast table, but he didn't seem to
suapec' nothin', so I went on. I talked
pretty plain to him. It was right I
should. I owed it to the boy an to my
aelf to do it. . 'An* say the first three
hundred and sixty-five days there'll be
Just you two at the breakfast table, lr
you don't have no hired man boardln'
with you, an' after that, there'll be a
new little face ev'ry year or so, an^
eome of the faces will be like yours an
some like hers, an* there'll be sickness,
an' sorrow, an' some happiness mixed
in with It. Maybe agood deal of hap
piness If she's the right one, but there'll
be mighty little If she's the wrong one.
An* all through it Jlmmie was aa sol
emn'as an owl, an' said when I got
done, 'Mother* (he's called me mother
most always since he was fifteen),. 'I've
thought out all that, an' there's Just
one girl that I want, an* I'm goln* to
have her If I can get her, an' If you
can help me. all right, I want you to do
It. but If you can't, I'll go it alone, but
I'r.i goin' to keep on tryin*."
"Well, v.Iien I see he was in earnest.
I told him I'd help him all I could, an'
told him I thought he might make
his. plans to be married Christmas
time, but not to say nothin' about it to
nobody.. Only one thing he must do,
he must keep away from the girl, an* if
Â¦he happened to meet her, he must act
kind o* cool, an' as if he thought he
could stand -U if she didn't care for
him. He almost refused, but I says,
â¢All right, then, no weddin' for Christ
mas,' an* then he come 'round, mighty
quick. ' Only he said he didn't think he
could act that way, an' I told him It
was a case of got-to, nothin' else.
Seems so queer to me that men can't
act and put on as if they was Just the
opposite from what they Is. when a wo
man has to do it all the time. *,Â»\
'"He seemed to feel lots cheered by
our ride, an* the next Sunday afternoon
I sent him away over to the other side
of the county. No special errand, but
there wa'n't no use his hangin' 'round
that- girl, an* the drive wouldn't hurt
him. Of course, he thought the errand
was a do-or-dle matter, or he wouldn't
have felt like goin*.
"On Tuesday the next week I put on
my things an' went over to one of the
neighbors that knew this girl's folks
pretty well, related some way, I guess.
I just dropped In to visit awhile, an' to
get a pattern for a new kind of apron
she had, an' of course I wanted to start
the good- work. Now I've always'
thought this neighbor was a good
spreader. Just as you're the other kind.

CHAPTER VIII.
A Woman's Wifes.
"Why, good afternQQn. I'm awful
glad to see you, Haven't. sÂ«en you to
have a -visit with since I : don't j know
when. Two years, is It* ' Well." several
things has happened elnce then. Of
course, If you lived over. In our neigh
borhood, you'd know all about . 'em.
At least the neighbors there think they
do. : . But I ; came over Just to free my
mind, I've Just got through about the
hardest plan to work that I ever under
took. You know how hard it Is to do
anything without tools that you can
depend on. Well, it's a sight harder to
do with tools that thinks they know
what they're doin' all the time, an 1
you're afraid they'll go ahead an'
spoil all your plans! ,
I'You know I've always taught .the
boya to come to me whenever they got
in trouble. . Real trouble, I mean/Oh,
no, I make 'era stand little things by
themselves, but whenever I see" 'em
worryin' fQr some little time, I usually
manage' to give 'em the chance to tell
me about It, an* If I can't help 'em out,
well, they're pretty near'; past helpin',
though I do say It myself. ,. ,
"JJmmle had been kind o' blue an'
ftidgety an' tljedÂ»lookln' for some little
time. All right again? .Well, you Juat
wait till I- get through an' you'll know.
I stood it havin' him around that way
till I thought It was pretty near" time
neck. One reason's cause I'm feelin* so
good. .[. Why? Oh. Just you wait till I
get done* an' you'll know.
"Well.at this picnic that I was at,
this girl that Jlmmie liked so well
started in gettln' the tables set for din
ner. I could see by her busineas-like
way that she knew what she was doln'.
I'd never met ? her before, but I knew
her folks bank for three generations.
She took right hold, an* she ran things.
She didn't boss 'round. "My, no 1 That
ain't the way to run things! She Just
started the poor, sticks that wasn't any
good at help in* off after water an' ferns
to decorate the table, she said. * I knew
that it was Just to keep 'em out of the
way. An' the .worst old crank In the
lot she got i to ' makin' sandwiches. I
heard- her tell ; this one that she could
cut the nicest, thinnest, even slices, an'
that old crank Just swallowed It all In,
an',, believed 'it.. Catch anybody gettln'
round me that. way. -She just kept
things goin' that way till she had the
dinner all. fixed," an' the. folks down, to
the table, an" she played those folks off
against each - other ', (the old crabbed
ones, I mean) till she got 'em all seated
'round the table cloth, so r that each one
thought he was the one person in that
crowd that was Â¦ bein' â¢ honored by the
way the seats was placed.
"I saw she had her eye on. Jimmie, so
as soon as dinner was over, an' I heard
her say, 'Well. I helped get the dinner
on. Somebody else can get it picked
up,' I calls Jlmmie an' says, 'I want
some of that peppermint that's frowin'
down by the spring In the next pasture.
Will you get me some?' He' looked
kind o'-as if he had some other plans,
but he said he would. I thought it Just
as well- that she shouldn't think she
could whistle, an* have Jlmmie come,
like as if he was a puppy.
"I paw him start off, an' then I got
to visitin'. There was some folks that
lived over where I used to, an' I had
about twenty years of ketchln', up to
do, an' I had to hear all about the folks
that had died, an* got, married, an' all,
since I'd left there.' Then one old man
got started on a long-winded yarn (I
thought nobody else would ever get a
chance to talk again) - an' \ I began
thinkin' about how -that girl, after
she'd got the dinner,'- Just "walked out
an' left the rest to do their share. An'
I made up my mind then an' there that
she was the right kind. There's the
awfully willin' kind that'll work an'
work an' never seem to know when
they've gdt their share done. Then
there's the kind that knows Â¦ when
they've done their, share.: an' stops
when they get it done. That's the kind
I like. I believe it's as wrong to do
more than your share of work as It Is
to shirk your share. One . way, you
cheat somebody else out. of the chance
to. do their share, an' the other you
force somebody else to do your share.
An' I don't know but cheatin' is the
worst of the two. I know I'd rather do
the shirkin'. An' I could see that she
knew when she'd done her share.
"Come time to start gettin' ready to
â¢go home, an' somebody began yellln
for the young folks to come back.
all come In wagon loads, so there
wasn't -to be any leavln' the young
folks to come home in their buggies
when they got ready, an' besides most
of us had our chores to do. Well, I be
' gun to look around for. Jimmie. I never
needed to look for Jim. If he ever got
out from under my feet I was glad
enough. Frankie was In town, In the
doctor's office studyin'. Pretty soon I
see Jimmie comln' up the hill, an' who
should be with him but that girl, an' as
I live, he didn't have a sprig. of pepper
mint. I didn't say anything when he
come up, but that girl, she looked at
me kind o* sassy like, ajj' I could have
hugged her right then an' there,, when
she said, 'I gueas Jimmie forgot all
about the peppermint, but here's some
I brought for you,' an', she pulled out
from the front of her shirt waist a lit
tle smitch with about three leaves, an*
handed it to me. Jframie didn't have
nothin' to say all the way home, anV
he'd shut up like a clam if I. so much
as mentioned peppermint for awhile.
' . "So you see, I knew the girl, an' I
"felt as bad as Jimraie did about it, only
I knew It was the best thing for him
that she wouldn't. hay e him first askln'. s
It's lots more worthwhile havin' any
thing if; you have to. work an* scheme
an' contrive for a year or so gettln' it,
than if. it , falls into your arms first
thing. : ; .
"I told Jlmmie that the best thing he
could do was to keep away from her.
Ofcourse, he didn't want to. I told
him, Â« of \ course, that I thought there
"was nicer girls, an' glrla that wquld
make him better wives, an* that he
: ought to remember that he was goln' to
havethe farm, an' that he'd be one of
â¢ the best catches in the county, so he
ought ; to" look around; ; an* not I get '
snapped up : by somebody that didn't .
,have anything at all.' Maybe. 1 stretch
ed the ..truth when I said what I 'did
about better wives an' nicer girls, but
â¢ if. a mother ain't got . the right to
stretch :, the . truth for her boy's sake,
who has, I'd; like to know?
, !. "Then I began real serious-like askin*
him. if he'd ever, stopped to think what I
. it means to get married, >n* to give" up
. , all .the ; flirtations, with other girls, * an'
Just stick .to one. An', if, he thought
\thls girl .was the one girl that he'd like
I to set down to breakfast with, an* din
ner, an', supper, , too, for the rest of bis
life. Â¦ ;Just ; think,' says I, there are
three .hundred < and â¢ sixty-five days .-in '
, a year, an'.? three meals In the day , ; ah*
you'll . live iat least fifty years, so you'll
"have to set down to the table with her
When . I want a thing kept, an' I'm
pretty near bustin" holdin" it in, I come
over an' tell you, but when I want a
thing spread, an' well spread, an'
spread without beln* mixed In the pro
cess, I go to her. She tell3 everything,
but she tells it straight. . If I want the
thing well mixed an' stretched before
it's spread, I go to another neighbor.
She couldn't tell any thin' straight If It
was only two words. Well, we got to
talkin', an' she happened to mention
the girl, an' said somethin' about Jim
mie's goin' with her. an' I says, kind o*
careless . like, 'Oh, he ain't goln' with
her any more; An' do you know, I
don't care If he don't go with her? She's
a nice enough girl, but â well, I've got
some other plans for Jlmmie.' There
was a new family moved into the town
ship over east, an' I knew she'd think I
was thinkin' about one of them girls.
The next day I sent Jimmie over to the
new family's on an errand, an" the day
after that ray spreadln' neighbor
hitched up an' drove over to where the
girl lived that Jlmmie wanted so bad.
"Well, there was a picnic the next
week, an' Jlmmie took one of the new
family's" girls, as I told him to. He
didn't have a good time, but what's
one. picnic more or less, when there's a
lifetime's happiness at stake? The next
week there wag another picnic an" the
girl was there. Jlmmie had gone with
me, but he got away durln* the after
noon. I went down after some of that
peppermint that'Jimmle hadn't got for
me the time, before, an* while I was
comin' back (I was alone, havin* man
aged to get away from Jim for a Uttle
while, though he did look kind o' lost
without me), who should I meet but
Jimmie an' his girl, an' her hair was
kind o' mussed, an' her cheeks was so
red, an' Jimmie's eyes twinkled so, an*
yet he looked so sheepish, that I asked
Just this way, 'When's It goln* to be?'
An' Jlmmie burst out, 'Christmas. '. I
sent Jimmie on ahead, teilln' him I had
a few things to say to the girl, an*
while we was talkin', she says, "The
' only reason I give him the mitten the
.first time he asked me was Just 'cause
you folks was so well off, an* I ain't
got nothin'," an* I was afraid you'd be
thro win' that up to Jlmmie all the time
when we was married. But when you
told. Cousin Jane, what you did about
me, that made me mad, an' I made up
my mind. to get him in spite of you.'
Then I laughed, an' said, 'Well. I'll try
to get along with you for Jimmie's
sake.'
- "An*, that's why I come over to-day
We want j you to come to the weddin*
Christmas. I know it's a long time
ahead, but it's the last. big doin's we'll
be havin' on the old place, for Jim an*
IVgoIn* to move to town the. first of
the year so , that Fr&nkie can have
somebody to look out for him."
THE END. ' -
be worse than the . coffee, so he'd try
some of the fried potatoes. My, how
mussy they looked in the dish! He
passed his cup back once Â¦ for some
more v coffee. -He liked coffee, an' I
didn't see how he could stand it, but I
guess he thought' he :had to drink It
anyway. An' before: she could fill the .
cup she had to brush back some strag
glin' hairs, that looked as: if they was
goin 1 Into the cup, an' I see Jimmie
scowl, an' I thought -what a great big
difference it- makes ' whether you see I
'the N llght hair fluffln' 'round her face'
when you're .settin'. beside her on a" 1
moonlight night, or on a mornin' from
across the breakfast table. ' 'Â¦Â¦
"Then^JImmie'd; try to talk! I al
ways made the boys talk at meals. I
don't believe in' folks settin' down ah*
feedin' themselves as if they, was stuf-'
fin* the business end: of a thraahln* ma
chine.. An' all Jennie could say' was
just nothin', an' giggle, only she; didn't I
feel much like gigglln' ; now, she. was so
cross. Then Jimmie gave up an' sat
tryin' to eat an' not sayin' a word, an';
1 thought again how much different the
same giggle sounds when you 'hear ' It *
in the ; moonlight Â¦ or oh : Sunday, after
noon, -when ev'ry body's: careless an'
happy," an', when : you ; set opposite that
same giggle at the breakfast table ev'ry,
â¢day. â¢"â¢.-â¢.,
. "Finally Jim made such a fuss that I- ,
was afraid j the | young folks would hear
him, 'cause' I wouldn't; go back- to, bed. .
do' you know, he ; really thought I .
was sick all the tlmean' I didn't dare;
tell, him what I was t tryin'. *; to do for
fear he would give it away?' So I went
back to | bed an'.: Jimmie . come" in | to see
how I was before he went off to '.work.
He looked hungrier than ever an' I
pitied him. ;.: I -almost wanted, to reach ;
under-the pillow an', give him some "of -
the cookies that I had to, nibble" on be r
tween- times, vbut-Ii thought iti better >
not to. -Then he started off to work an' Â¦.,
I knew that he iwas; quite cured when
I i see him start off Â¦ to the other; end of
the farm \ In: spite of what ; his father
had planned' for>hlm ; .to: do .near the
house;.
'Â¦"About 'ten o'clock sister ! drove up, ;

pleased 'as Â¦ could ,bei to i; see mej^up: an'
around.>. An!* he' looked' mighty; relieved â¢
when Â«he looked .around '.' and ' didn't â¢ see '
for him to come to me. I see one day
he was tryin' to arrange it so we could
have a good talk together, so I planned
for him to" take me to town. I don't
know of a better place to talk than in
a buggy. An" then I "kind o' think
Jimmie's more used to talkin' on such
subjects as he was goin' to talk about
when he's out drivin'. . So. we started
out for town, an* as v soon as We got
started he begun. I don't remember
juat what he said, but the substance
was that he wanted my advice about a
girl that, he'd been goin' with, 'an' he
thought she; was the only one for him,
an'. she seemed , to like him, but when
he popped the question she give . him
the 'mitten, an' the poor. boy ..was all
broke up. He kind o' stammered an'
get ' so' mixed up that I had to guess
about half he was tryin'to say, but I
knew \ most -of It ; before, so it didn't
make a difference. ' Of course, I
couldn't. let him" know, that I knew It at
all, f cause it's Just as well* sometimes
that' the men should think ..we women's
as glow an' dull 1 as they be. I kep' on
askln' questions," an'he kep* on feelin'
worse an' worse.. I knew the boy was:
pretty. badly smlt, as I thoroughly apv
proved of the girl. Of course, I knew
her. There ain't ," a girl in our part r of
the country; nor; many. In ? other : parts
that I don't know; An' I know whether
they ever look ; at I my boys, too, an' I
know: ev'ry one of their famines back
as far as when they; first come, to .the
county, anyway.- Why, 'a mother's got
to . know them things. ' . How's ; her boy
goin', to be. happy. if she don't see that
he gets; the ; right girl?,. Of course, I
never interfere when a boy's .: in love,
but it's Just, as well not'tolet ; him!get'
in | love with ; a' girl that ain't the right
one. * I don't know what boys does that â¢
ain't got no mothers; or is so Â¦ far away
from: 'em that' the mothers can't /know
the girls the boys knows.'- But usually,
if the: boy.; is right; smart, he'll ;look
around an', finda second mother, who'll
kind o'.:take the, place of the one that's
gone/ or ain't -there," an".help : >himÂ£"out
when. he needs help. *
. "As ; I wai sayih', I knew, the girl. I'd
been, to a picnic once rwhere' she was/
Picnics?. Of course we go to picnics, as,
long as weican stand to ride in. rockin'
chairs - In Uhe~ backs 1 of * 4 wagons, or .can
stand to ' be dressed long , enough i to get j
to the picnic place and back, an' I have
heard of ; one old man who always '< had

all K the : ,way I home. * What's â¢ picnics ; for ;

fun?" Wellâ seems as if I 'couldn't stick
to : what ' I'm ;tellin' ! to-day to-. save my
an' wanted to go for the doctor. " Then
I told him that all we needed to worry
about was for some one to do the work
till my sister come on Thursday. I had
felt the spell comin* on, so I'd written
for her. But we'd have to have some
one to do the cookln' an' look after me
a little, 'cause the men had their work
to do around the farm.- So I told him
to go over an' see if Jennie couldn't
come over an* stay till my sister come.
I. said somethln' about that she ought
to be willin' to come, an' Jimmie
blushed like anything. But he started
off, so as to have her back by dinner
time. After he was gone, I got up an'
hid away some more of the bakin' I'd
done the Saturday before, thinkin' it
Just as well that Jimmie should have a
Plenty of his girl's cookln'. You know
since Jimmie had been workin' on the
farm, we didn't have any hired man,
so I couldn't get the hired man's wife
to help out.
"She came 'back with him, an* they
found me In bed, restin' a little easier
than when he went away, but it was
pretty near time for Jim to be home,
an' Jimmie had left some work that
had to be finished.. so they both had
to go to work. It was kind o* lone
some layin* there flat on my back, but.
I'm willin' to suffer in a good cause, an*
if that wasn't one I never see one. ; The
girl had her conceit right with her an'
went to work to get a big dinner, i I
could smell It when she some in to Bee
how. I was . gettln' along. I hated to
have bo much good., victuals go to.
wastÂ«. an* yet I thought of, my plans,
an' I can give up a good deal to have
my plans go through.
"Jim come home before dinner, an*,
for a minute was pretty badly scared,
but I calmed him down, an' finally, per
suaded him not to think he had to go :
for the doctor. I told him we could get
along all right till my sister come,- an',
then she'd bring me, round all right.
"Jennie looked smart an', chipper as
could be at dinner, an' I guess it wa'n't
more than half spoiled, an* besides
there, was some.'of bakin 1 left, but I
knew. . that would run out at suppert
time. Then . she would have to make .
bread or . biscuits. I hoped she'd . try
both. I could â¢ hear ' Jimmie come in
ev'ry once in awhile durin' 1 the after
noon an* stop an' talk a while with the:
girl, an' finally after what seemed like
days, supper time came. All I had /was
tea an' toast; an', the. tea was too weak
an' the toast was cold. But I ; remem
bered the other; martyrs,' . an' ' thought
how glad I ought to be to get even' that
much. ' Before gettin'-up. time : next
mornin', I made up my mind that, most
of them that's wha,t they- call 'chronic ;
invalids' is really : sick, so sick of layin'
'round that they're so weak they can't:
get uj>. : - â¢
.- "I don't think breakfast went ' off ' so
very well the next mornin', for-. I-
on the next farm, thÂ© Hawkins :. one,
you know, the one we didn't buy, an*
was pretty well acquainted before ever
Jimmie come home to , stay. > Then he
went to one of their parties, an' pretty
soon his little '.Â¦ drivin' mare an', new
top buggy was workin' nights an'. Sun- :
days, an* even then it seemed as if they
couldn't keep up.: Of course, I knew all
the time what. was goln' on, an 1 .- while,
of course I knew It was one of the new,
folks, I hardly thought that Jlmmie
would be such a â¢ fool as . to take ' the;
least likely one of the whole lot. But â¢
that's Just like a boy. looks- Js all they
think about.- Well, of course, I'd been
over to visit 'em, an' I -kep' my eyes .
open. Any woman that thinks any
-" thing of her sons keeps her eyes open
when there's girls around that there's
any* ganger of her boys takjn* a shine
to. Ah' J noticed when there was any
work to be done, that the oldest girl
was called onto do It, an* that the one
that Jimmie wo* so sweet on was. late
In comin' down to meals, an' shewent
â¢round the house tWleven o'clock with
her shoes unfastened, an* her-, hair
wasn't. combed till the dinner-bell rang,
one mornin' I was there. I -don't be
lieve In that sort of thing, an' my boys
ain't used to it. at least not since I' Ye
been their ma, an*. I knew that Jimmie
didn't ever see that side of the girl's
character. â¢ ..
"Jlmmie kep' on gettln' worse an'
worse smlt, an' finally -I made .up .my
mind it was time to do somethin',
They wasn't engaged yet, I knew that,
but they was Just on the point of bein'.
Anybody with any kind o* eye .can tell
when a young couple is Just on â¢ the
point o' bein* engaged. I don't know
Just how it is. but if you ever see a
couple together, or see one of 'em
when the other is spoken of, you can
always tell.
"One week I wrote to my sister an
asked her to come an' see me the next j
week Thursday. I knew she'd get
there about 10 in the mornin', an' then
I began carryln' out the rest of my
plan. I got Jim to arrange the farm
work so that Jlmmie could be around'
the house for two or three days Just
before my sister come, not loafln'. but
workin' near enough the house so he
could come In two or three times In the.
forenoon, an' the same. In. the after
noon.
"On Monday mornin 1 after ! Jim had
gone to town with Frankie, I was
taken sick so I couldn't do anything.
I rung the dinnerybell for Jimmie an'
then went into the house an* dropped
onto the lounge in the slttin'-room. He
come In on the run, an' found me
stretched out on the lounge, an' he had
to help me to the bedroom. I wasn't
so sick as I was Just weak. I told him
I'd been havin' such spells for some,
time before, for he was awful scared,
Bervea, or anything except Just the
most common things, that we Just had
to have. We hadn't had any cake for
almost two weeks, now, an' sauce only
once when we had company. Jim
looked around over the table, an" then
he says more' n I ever heard him say
at one time before, 'Ma, I guess we
might as well have all we want to eat,
now, again.. I told Hawkins this after
noon that weÂ« wouldn't want his farm,
wouldn't have 'no -use for it. An' â¢ to
morrow, you can" do your bakln' for
that picnic next Wednesday, 'cause on
Saturday we're coin' to town, all of us,
to get the boys some clo'es, an'- to ar
range for a boardin'-place for 'em; so'b
to be ready when school begins. "Ap'..
you can send Mis' Jones' sewin'- back I
an' tell her you ain't goln' to do It. 1
An* then I said, for of course I had to
have the last word, 'Why, pa, that sew-
In* is the waist I'm makln'-to wear to
the picnic next week-' "
CHAPTER VII. -
A SlartjT to the Cause.
"Good mornln', I'm right glad to sea
you. Thought since Jim had to come
over here to attend court that I'd come
along and spend the day. Oh, yes, I'm -.
well. You heard I was sick? Yes, the
report got around. I did have to have
some help for awhile, but we're all all
right again. The boys? Oh, they're
both well. Frankie is In the high
school In town. Stays In from Monday
till Friday. Jimmie's helpin 1 to run the
farm. 'How old is he?' did 3"ou say?
Oh, Jimmie's 19, now, an* Prankie's 17.
He wants to be a doctor, an' eo we're
givin* him the chance. Jlmmie wants
to stay on the farm, an' he's doin'
right well, too. Jim seems to be gettln'
eo he don't care If he don't work. Talks
about movin' to town, an' I expect he'll
want to give up the farm to Jlmmie as
eoon'a he gets married. . . -
"Oh, no, he ain't thlnkln' of gettlri*
married, now. He was thlnkin' pretty
serious awhile ago, but he's got all over
that. Of course, he wouldn't have got
married right away, he's so young, but
he would have got engaged, an* he's the
kind that don't back out of anything
when be gets started, so I s'pose he'd
be wantln' to get married pretty soon
if I hadn't been sick. An' that's what
I come to tell you about. It seems so
good to have one place where I can
come an' talk without it's beln" spread
all over the township. Of course, it
comes handy to have things spread
once in awhile, but this ain't one of
'em. An* it's no fun talkin" to Jim
about it, for he don't seem to under
stand. But Jimmie's different. He can
understand, but this ain't a subject
that it's best to talk to him about.
"What am I talkin' about? Well,
ain't I goin* to tell you Just as soon as
I can? Now I'll start at the beginnln*.
Last year when Jlmmie come back
from town school, an" made up. his
mind to stay on the farm, he found we
had some new neighbors. They was a
whole parcel of 'em. mostly girls,' with
a Ehifless, ol* t'bacco-furnace ol a
father, an' a dragged-out, washed-out,
ol' mother, an* the whole lot of 'em
went slantin' along like as If they was
R-anin' up against the wind. An' I
kind o* suspected they had consump
tion, the whole kit an* bilin* of 'em. but
I wasn't sure, an' I ain't yet But the
girls all looked slick's could be, when
they was fixed up. All had yaller hair,
an 1 pink cheeks, an* blue eyes, that's
bright an 1 pretty now, but Just you
wait till they've been through what
their mother has. or any other woman
that lives on a farm, an' they'll have
that same dragged-out, white-eyed
look that their mother has.
"That's one trouble with boys gettin'
married. They dom't look far enough
back even to see the mother. The girl
herself Is the whole thing with them,
an* three-fourths of the time they don't
seem to think that 'like mother, like
daughter, like father, like son.' an'
when they ain't happy after' they're
married, they blame ev'rybody bul
themselves. Just s'pose they was out
buyin' horses. "Wouldn't they expect
to get a crib-bitin', kickin* colt if the
mc-ther was a crlbber an* a kicker, an'
the colt had been raised with the
mare? An' yet they don't use half the
Judgment In pickin' out their wives
that the commonest fool does In buyin'
his horses an' cattle. If it's good pay
in' policy to have pedigree cattle, on'
registered horses, an even pigs, why,
in the name of common sense, ain't It
a good payin' policy to know what your
wife's folks was, whether they was the
kind that 6tarved out everywhere they
ever lived, or whether they really had
gumption enough to do things an'
make a livin'? An' you can't depend on
the kind o' houses the folks live In to
tell anything about it. Some of these
here log cabins back in the woods
turn out better pedigreed youngsters
than some of your swell' houses in
town. You've Just got to use your
common sense 'cause the finest regis
tered cattle don't always have the best
stables. That; is, use what's a wo
man's common sense! Seems like that's
a man's uncommon sense. Well, It
seems as if when I get started on this
subject I never can stop, an* I don't
get the chance to talk very often on it,
for Jim Just laughs, an' of course I
can't talk to the boys. There's things
that It's Just as well not to talk to the
boys, but that ; don't mean that you
mustn't Impress It on 'em some other
way. But I'll go back to what I was
tellln', now. BPSkBQW

/TAKE it as a personal grievance
that a grudging publisher has made

England's poems, "Underneath . the

in the reflection that poems gain little
enough recognition from reviewers,
and that even though a tardy one, per
force, . this brief estimate of some ex
ceptional verse may lead others to read
and ' be charmed.
Â» Mr. I' England's verse is not notable
for originality, save in the realmlof
the j bizarre. His poems Yof life and

7 HE book "Guns, Ammunition 2nd
Tackle," which is brought out
in Macmillan's American
Sportsman's Library under the gen
eral editorship of Caspar Whitney, is
full of meaty things for all followers
of the gun and rod. The practical
and the theoretical in matters . of
small game shooting, the teachings of
experience in handling the rifle either
at the target or in the woods, and the
latest wisdom culled from the modern
Izaak Walton are herein garnered into
a satisfying storehouses of facts.
At first off Captain A- W. Money,
who has, according to his own word,
burned more powder and shot more
game than any man living, contributes
an exhaustive review of "The Shot
gun and It3*Handling." Incidentally
Captain Money confesses to having
been twice shot through carelessness
and having inadvertantly put shot
himself into three men and two boys
during the course of his career as a
sportsman, so the first and foremost
law he gives voice to In reference to
handling a gun comes with authority.
"Let any amount of game escape
sooner than run the slightest risk of
blinding, maiming or killing a human
being."
Captain Money draws interesting
comparisons between the class of
shooting done by Englishmen and
Americans. Over in the tight little
isle a sportsman has his pheasants
reared by hand, "or by a complacent
hen, rather, fed and counted by a
careful gamekeeper, and shot per
schedule . at an estimated" cost "of %Â»
a bird. . In this country the veriest
shaver shoots his rabbits and squirrels
fancy free and therefore - when he
grows to manhood he "outpoints his
English cousin at' every turn, accord
ing to this authority. The plentiful
quantity , of our game and the free
dom allowed to those wishing to hunt
It account for our superiority In
marks mans nip.
Two articles on the rifle, the prac
tice and theory of its use, by Horace
Kephart and W. E. Carlln. seem to
to give' every possible crumb of infor
mation concerning! that valuable arm,
even down: to the "algebraic determina
tion" of -its .trajectory of fire.l In "dis
cussing - the : killing power of * bullets
Mr. , Kephart comes out^ strongly, for
the "soft; nosed" variety in^that such
guarantees t a more -certain mortality
than the ] high speed, hard missiles.

heart of the "Black Beit'^in tne river
bottoms of Northern Misissippi, where,
as that fiery gentleman himself says,
tht- whites are living on the top of a
black volcano. The author has con
jured urra situation â not unusual, we
admit â wherein the brutal negroes un
der the leadership of a voodooistic
"queen" commit acts r of desperate
fiendishness against the handful of
whites who represent the thin line of
law and order in the district. In re
taliation the whites even exceed the
blacks In the cruelty of their reprisals
and to the uninitiated dweller beyond
the border it seems that "the law of
the land" Is naught but the conspicu
ous absence of all law.
Against well meaning but mis
directed enthusiasts of the North, who
are constantly urging upon the negro
his right to share in the Government,
Hcugh lays all the blame for the con
ditions he depicts in his novel. He
would have it that such agitators have
even wrought in the minds of the
ignorant blacks the dream of a black
republic In the South; that they have
caused the negroes to have faith in a
John Brown redfvivus. Here is the
Southern whites* protest against the
attitude of the North:
"But we denounce and always will
denounce that false decree which say3
that black Is white; that inequality is
equality; that lack of manhood is
manhood itself; that the absence of a
hearthstone can mean a home; that
the absence of a home can mean a per
manent society." â¢
Hough Is evidently sincere in these
sentiments and nothing- of the poseur
can be detected In his attitude. But in
the working out of the clash between
white and black in the story he In
troduces situations which certainly
would well adapt themselves, to the
10, 20 and 30 cent "home of refined
melodrama." . A. score of murdered
negroes sit stark along the benches
of their flooded meeting-house," with
alligators rasping their grisly way
across the slimy floor. (Green cal
cium and shivery music.) Or again,
the booming o'f an African war drum
in the canebrake and the chanting of
barbaric tribal incantations by citizens

borders on the sensational, to say the
least.

Chevalier" and whose portrait includes
the impression of some, cross or other
of the Holy Order of Thingumbob, has
despite all this a fearful and wonderful
power of invention. He takes for the
motive of his tale the old convention of
hidden treasure, but the key to its find-
Ing is something entirely novll in the
record of light fiction, and for that he
must be praised. Nothing less than an
ancient codex or memorandum, which
poisons the reader even as It yields the
secret of hidden treasure, Is the pin in
Le Chevalier's plot machinery upon
which all is balanced.
On the blank pages of an ancient folio
of forgotten lore which the narrator of
the story had picked up from the cel
lecticn of an antique dealer in Florence
there is written the confessions of one
Godfrey Lovel, one time secretary to
the infamous Lucrezia Borgia and co
conspirator in many of that Jezebel's
poisoning plots. This memorandum oÂ£
the old villain details the particulars of
many of the mysterious deaths that
signalized the pontificacy of Alexander
VX and ends with a description of the
hiding place cf the famous Borgia jew
els, as well as a key to the finding of
fabulous treasure that had been' hidden
by the monks of Croyland in England
In anticipation of the raids of bluff
King Hal's monastery levelers.
But this same Godfrey Lovel, true to
his profession of poisoner, has Impreg
nated the leaves of this book with some
of his favorite essences, so that the
possible reader will- never live to seek
out the hiding places of treasure which
he T*mÂ« revealed. Of course, then, &
grisly path of mystery and destruction
follows through the Chevalier's tale of
the reading of this deadly book and the
eventual uncovering of glittering gems.
The shadow of the Borgias fails

Of course this ; Owen Kildare was
made much of when first he began to
tell Vof the V life Jthat Â£ei had lived in
Bowery/dive andU the*: : Bleecker street
gam Dling "hole, and by certain of the
newspaper editors .and writers of New
York he was treated as a gifted freak
of the social order â u man to be lion
ized in the sanctum and double-lead
ed in the paper. Under all this wall
meant flattery it seems that the man.
who had once been"- "booster" for a
dance hall on the Bowery had the
hard good sense to remain unruffled.
His first papers â brief sketches telling
of the life of the ! "submerged tenth" â
have little of the^self-conscious about
them and much that betrays the dia
mond in the rough. By comparing
these random first flights of Kildare's
genius with the real literary finish and
neatness of workmanship displayed in
his subsequent book, "My Mamie
Rose," one can deduce an interesting
lesson in the normal growth of the art
of written expression.
Through, all of these sketches there
can be found the old Kildare where

Frederick Lawrence Knowles has
boiled down Captain Marryat's "Peter
Simple" to a size and consistency com
mensurate with youthful assimilation
and put it forth under the title, "The
Story of Little Peter." The original
"Peter Simple" Is unquestionably one
of the best sea tales In English,. and
this abridgment of it to fit the appreci
ation of little readers is a commend
able work. * Dana Estes & Co. of Bos
ton publish the book.
The poet's conception of death admits
nothing of the fanciful, the spiritual;
It is steeped in realism, grim, maybe,
to the length of repulsion but powerful,
wonderfully powerful. Witness this
sennet addressed to three Peruvian
mummiesâ "The Royal Council," It is
named.

Another conception of this tangible
presence of death, "Carmen Mortis,"
incorporates a realism too strong to be
poetic, for it Is disgusting, though
wonderfully imaginative. Mr. England
should not let this appear in a possible
second impression of this volume.
Passionate love exhibits in some of
the poet's songs a burning
The transitory glory of beauty and
youthful transports strikes from. Eng
land, as from De Musset, a note of
dole. The following, after Ronsard in
the French, gives, expression to the
poet's feeling:

In addition ' to this dominant strain
cf love and death this little volume of
verse Incorporates some very sympa

several translations from earlier lyric

ish adds to the book's worth.

â¢9 *R. UPTON* SINCLAIR, anew
f^/M arid a very young writer â he
â¢/ rJL is yet well this side of thirty
has essayed the monumental
task cf writing a triology on the
Civil War. His first novel. "Mi
r.aswg.s." which has just been published,
deals with the train of events that hur
ried the country on to the "Irrepressible
ccniict'*: the second, "Gettysburg.**
Â¦will catch the tremendous struggle at
izs climax and the last. "Appomattox."
is designed to reflect the dying Sicker
Â©f the last cause. Certainly a re
markable task it is that this young
novelist has set for himself. He has
yustb on his side and, to judge from
the first of his triology. enthusiasm in
great measure; something noteworthy
should be found in the completed
wcrk.
Mr. Sinclair's "Manassas" is not an
historical romance based on a great
rational movement such as Church-
Ill's "Tie Crisis." or "The Crossing 1 ';
it fs." rather/ a romantic" history with?
more cf the element of history in it.
than of romance. With only the slight-'
ert web of a plot for a foundation the
author has attempted a comprehensive
jFurvey of Oe^ tangled skein. of events
that led the arrayed forces of slavery
and abolitionism into death grips. His
i;or>' d:2ers from the legitimate his
torical narrative only in its feature of
a close and intimate reflection of the
sixrial aspect of the great moral strug-
gle that preceded the kindling of the
war torch. The romantic coloring of
the strife â an element that is missed
by the -RTiter of historyâ is in Sin
clair's book the real cause of being.
This method of fitting romance so
closely to history that nothing of the
latter may be obscured has its .fail
ings, very plainly manifested in "Ha
nassas." Viewed strictly as a novel.
It cannot be called gÂ»i because the
unities cf the novel are made sub
ordinate to the sequence cf historical
events; they axe even made to strain
themselves into alignment with the
ta.me- As a navel, "Manassas" fail3
again because cf the discursiveness
compelled by the author's attention to
the recital cf history- Whether under
the guise of long and irrelevant dia
logues cr frankly adduced as matter
divorced frcm the advancement of the
plot, the author has page after page
cf material that is not fiction, in any
eerse cf the word, but pure history.
The few characters he introduces, like
? he very flimsy plot, are mere shadows.
Eut as a careful and impartial study
cf tie complex series of events that
carried the country from the Missouri
Compromise to the day of the great
rent at Bull Run Mr. Sinclair's book is
Inspiriting reading. He has caught the
psychology cf history. If the term may
be used, the Inner workings cf Inspira
tion. Â«sg*estion and Impulse, which had
their rsarlfestatlons la the hurried
sweep cf events. The eddying currents
of thoexfct. which found expression in
the balls of Congress. la fiery Southern
barbecue and Northern council of the
"underground railroad." the author has
traced. All cf the elements of discord
between North and South that united
to drive them arunder are tersely and
TlgsrcTigly outlined. Perhaps with the
exception cf Thomas Nelson Page's
books co novel has photographed so
rclnutely acte-bellum spirit in the
Eouth.
Elcce Sinclair's story hews so closely
to the line of historical record the play
cf dramatic Incident has no great part
in It save as an elaboration* upon actual
events. There are two incidents, how
ever, wherein the titular hero cf the
tale come* to the fore In stirring ac
tion â one the hound hunt after an es
caped slave, ard the other the battle of
Bull Run, cr Manassaa, as the Confed
erates termed the field. In both these
opportunities the author exhibits a
virile pen for dramatic action. .Stephen
Crane's battle picture. The Red Badge
of Courage," Is no more vivid than Sin
clair's panorama of Bull Run; the psy
chology of strife in both- is equally well
done.
So much for "Manassas." If young
Mr. Sinclair holds to Â«tis project of a
trioiogy novel readers may live In
pleasurable anticipation. Let us hope,
though, that In "Gettysburg" and "Ap
pomattox" tliere win be no shadows for
charactersâ either flesh and blood or

suh. It came about because of a poem
âÂ¦the only one I ever wrote. I had
lectured several times on the battle
of Lookout Mountain, when my . old
friend Colonel Ross suggested | that I
write a poem on the same subject.
I gave the matter come thought and
then began th& work. It was to be
something to live for a thousand
years, and I took It slow and wrote
only when r felt like it I was writ

completed the task. There were 120

was a picture by itself. That poem

when the laet line of the glorious trib

and "he h*d. vrrittrn tr.e encoaraelne

house, and after we had partaken of a
cocktail or two, I etarted in to read the
poem. .To my Intense surprise, I had
not yet finished the first verse when
the Judge made a criticism. I had made
â¢attribute* rhyme with 'distribute,'
which Is. perfectly poetical, but the
Judge thought different. In the second
vene he suggested three changes; In
the third verse four, and in the fourth
verse he claimed to find false syntax,
bad rhyme and something like sacri

DANCING is said to have orig
inated under the skies of the
Pharaohs; it manifes'ted itself at
first in sacred sciences, severe
and hieratic: in the processions of
Apis.
In the course of ages it became in
terwoven, with all the expressions of
popular life, reflecting the passions of
man and translating the most secret
movements of the soul into physical
action. From the solemnity of relt
gious rites, from the fury of warfare,
it passed to the gayety of pastoral
sports, the dignity and grace of pol
ished society.
As early as the year 2545 B. C. we
find traces of the choregraphlc art;
no antique race gave themselves up
so eagerly to it as the Greeks; gait,
movements, even \ immobility, were
alike subject to ,its laws. This art
was so esteemed in Greece that chorus
masters or leaders were recruited
among the first citizens of the .com
monwealth.'" Their dances were very
numerous. and all derived from three
fundamental types, the sacred, the
military and the profane.- -In the
Hormos, I a sacred da~tce in honor of
Dian,a, all the youth of the two sexes
performed it unclothed, but without
offense to modesty, their attitudes be
ing chaste and beautiful. Such was
not the case in regard to profane
dances, which were often marred by
buffoonery and even by indecency.
Ritual dances were highly honored
by the Hebrews; David danced before -
the ark of the covenant in the choir
of the temple at Jerusalem; the Levltes
sang as they danced to the sound of
stringed and wind instruments. We
have also many other Instances of
public ceremonies, such as when Da
vid has slain Goliath, and Judith
bringing back the head of Holofernes;
they were all welcomed by dances.
The arts of Greece soon degenerated
after their migration to Rome; after
centuries of folly, which brought the
downfall of the great race, -dancing
disappeared; ' it is, however, to. be
traced again during the persecutions
of the early church, among the first
Christians. In the Church of St. Pan
eras at Rome there still exists a sort
of stage on which we are told priests
and worshipers Joined in measures,
led by the bishop. The Council of
Trent was concluded with a ball of
cardinals and bishops; but. at last a
papal decree abolished It in churches
and cemeteries.
National dances are generally a typ
ical expression of the race or epoch,
from which they originated. The
beurree of Poitou ' and Auvergne In
France is looked upon as a heavy
dance, somewhat coarse; the stamping
of sabots or wooden shoes is a char
acteristic accompaniment, marking
every third beat of the measure; it la
grave, and well becomes these rude
peasants. The modern wild cancan
needs no description, .being well
known. '
All Spain, indeed, thrills to the notes
of the fandango, pre-eminently the
national air, and one that accompanies
a step so ardent and so graceful. Men
and women, young and old, acknowl
edge its power, over the soul of every
Spaniard. The young, men spring to
their places, rattling castanets; the girls
are remarkable . for the willowy lan
guor, and' lightness of their : move
; ments, beating the exactest time with Â¦
tapping heels. Partners tease and en
treat and . pursue' each other by turns ;
suddenly the music stops! , and each

It is to- Ireland we must go for the
jig in all its vivacious activity, the
Irish race, possessing a natural taste
for both music and dancing. The lively
jig has a marvelous Influence over the
Celtic temperament which no alien
dance could in any way replace for
them* It has so strong a hold upon
them that few gatherings take place
among "the "peasantry without it. At
the numerous fairs groups of youths
will always be met with, merrily foot

with many stirring whoops and much
flourishing of shillelahs. We cross
over to the extremity of Europe â the

of the balaleica, on the fiat of the foot,
moving shoulders, arms and hips

his hips and his chest erect.' This done,

partner presents . herself and, without
touching each other,' the two perform
a pantomime, the motif of which Is the
eternal theme of coquetry. The girl Is
coy and the lover pursues her; she
throws down a flower, he picks it up
and strives to catch her. It is only In
the Russian army that choirs exist. At
the head of each regiment is a squad
of the best singers, who while away
the hours of marching by popular songs
that make the men forget their fa
tigue.
We now turn from Europe to the
land of the Erahmins. When an Asiatic
wishes to honor a guest, she shows him
his Davadassi (Bayaderes Is the name
only used by Europeans) ; it is the com
pliment of his hospitality. Their cold,
plastic beauty harmonizes admirably
with their dancing, which consists of a
.succession of statuesque noses. A sort
of quivering motion of their naked
feet causes a Jingling of the golden
rings and bells with which their legs
are laden, and this metallic cadenced
sound at last produces a curious effect
upon the ear and the nerves.
The Egyptian and Tunisian Almees
differ greatly from the Bayaderes, for
the very essence of their dances is ob
jectionable. -In Java the Tandak are
born in the fortress of the Sultan;
these virgins lead a very retired life,
and from their* birth and situation at
the court are held in profound respect.
The genesis of the Cakewalk, like a
famous birth, is "wrapt in mystery,"
and like . many other good things it
comes from the United States. The
"walk" and the barn dance, beyond all
question, have â¢ their origin In the
plantation sports; the latter took place
in the barn at the end of the harvest,
accompanied by banjos and "patting
juba," for the special enjoyment of the
slaves working in the fields; while the
prize walk was among the household
servants, who rather looked contemptu
ously on their rustic brothers. The
handsomest couples paired off, and be
ing dressed in their best they entered
Into the competition. A French paper
describes in the following amusing way
the "cakewalk": "How to define this
dance for which no rules exist? It Is
the triumph of personal improvisation;
its characteristic step reminds us of a
poodle being forced to stand i on its
hind legs; the dancer advancing by
little hops and leaps, holding his hands
exactly as the dog. would its front
paws,. curving his back in the most ex
aggerated fashion possible."
Â¦ Among the North Americans of yes
terday Cwe mean the aborigine In
dians) the custom of dancing was very
prominent in their social usages. The
Iroquols tribe alone had thirty-two dis
tinct dances, of which the Buffalo, the
Feather, the Sun and War, were es
teemed the highest. .Unfortunately the
native races and their ceremonies will
soon be a thing of the past. One dance,
however, still. occurs, and can be seen
in all Its glory and perfection, once
every two years; It Is the .weird Snake
dance of the Moquls. The snakes used
in these heathen rites are caught
eight days before. The young Indians
go to the north, the west, the south and
. east- -After being captured .the snakes

A COOLING WASH (Mrs. E. B. L.)â
The annoying prickling sensation
which you feel when very warm and
without the slightest visible signs of
rash is a trouble common to very stout
people and Is largely due to the acid
nature of the perspiration. The Irrita
tion Is most readily relieved by bathing
in conjunction with the application of
pome soothing toilet preparation to
cleanse and cool the overheated sur
face of the body. Four baths in Hie
.tub weekly and a sponge bath every
morning and alternate evenings before
retiring should keep the skin in ex
cellent condition without enervating
one. After drying the body rub on the
following lotion, which is both cooling
and tonic In its effect. . Take one-half
ounce of gum camphor, eight ounces of
best alcohol, one-half ounce tincture of
benzoin, two ounces of best cologne and
one pint of perfectly soft water. Dis
solve the gum camphor in the alcohol,
then slowly pour In the water, cologne
and lastly the benzoin drop by drop.
Shake well, strain through fine muslin
and bottle. Pour a small quantity in a
saucer and apply, with a small sponge
or with the fingers. Be particular to
change daily all garments which come
in direct contact with the body, avoid
ing wearing any material which sheds
lint. Silk and hard twisted Usle thread
undergarments are delightfully cool
and least objectionable in this respect.
Lace- .trimmed corset covers, - etc..
should be laundered without starching,
otherwise the tiny stiff points : of the
lace are very annoying when the skin
Is sensitive to the slightest touch.

TO REDUCE THE ABDOMEN (Sa

by regular massage, and the contour of
the figure restored by simple harmless
methods, which win benefit the general
health. The massage roller Is an inval
uable aid and can be freely used by
very delicate women, who might find
long exercise too fatiguing, but the
roller should* never take the place en
tirely of physical exercise. The roller
Is applied with the skin lightly covered
by a thin undergarment or towel. The
pressure must be^ very firm â¢ to break
down the fat cells/ and each movement
must be repeated from seventy-five to
a hundred times over, each section of
the body traversed. The object is to
take the blood from the parts, hence
the movements should be. lengthwise of
the muscles, not crosswise. Grasp "tha
roller In the right hand and start at the.

to stop in the center higher up by the
width of the roller each time, until the

him in ignorance of parties and pleas

the least nervous exhaustion. Games

scolding and punishment only aggra

in the room yourself, engaged in some
light work or with a book, will by force
of example help to soothe the frenzied
little brain and induce repese. The ca
pricious appetite must not be pam
pered. Plain, wholesome food daintily
served must be insisted u*?on at all
times. Keep the children In the open
air as much as you can. but avoid hot
suns and long walks. Short walks and
games interspersed with frequent rests
are best for nervous children.

nine-tenths cf what she hears, to go

remaining tenth is sound, eolld sense
zz.i she rarely ever fails to profit by It.
There was a time, but thanks be it
was long ago. when the girl Â»who
worked, or who had to count her pen
nies, considered it her bounden duty
to go about in a dull color, made In a
Cvll fashion and worn In a dull way
as well. Anything and everything to
get a/c-ay from the conspicuous. Skirts
were neither long nor short, blouses
neither tight nor loose, hats neither
email nor large. In the mad rush to
avoiÂ£ extremes, every art was sacri

a nightrsare.
It took years to accomplish the
change, but here it is and her* it is
going to Etay. The sensible girl figures
out in her mind's eye that brown, blue
or black is the most becoming color
she caji put on. and that once decided

afternoon frock a new blue and her
evening gown a lighter color, but still
binding Itself to her color scheme. And
then, and only then, does ehe realize
what an Immense disadvantage ehs
has been laboring under. For the first
tine in her life her belts, gloves and
ribbons match everything she puts on.

In the first place, every one abso

made of silk or velvet, in fact, of any
of the materials that chance to" have

and something that will - stand the

So much for one hat. The other
should be something fluffy and airy
and altogether pretty. In the color

there is a decided preference ft is far
better to get an all black one. for It
Is not only more fit at the time, but
wears far better in the lonp run. for
It may be almost shabby and still re

Then, too, the possibilities of a
large hat are numerous. One day it
may be a dashing Gainsborough trail
ing its feather coquettishly over one
ear and the next it may be a demure
poke bonnet trimmed with an arm
ful of sweet faced flowers. With a
twist it turns itself into the stunning
Napoleon, with its rosettes of many
colored satin, or again it remains ab
solutely round and unassuming, yet
withal very sweet and effective-

of May. Seal brown and sorrel brown
are used together.
But whatever be your suiting, let it
be a soft wool. And it is undoubtedly
smart to choose something with a hairy
surface. There are thin, pretty, soft
camel's hair goods that are moderate in
price and there is all the family of
Â¦ zibelines. One can surely find some
thing in these, "or. if c/ne prefers to do
so, there is always serge to fall back
upon.
Fine Materials for Suitings.
Serge and camel's hair, zibeline and
broadcloth are all very fine for the win
ter shirt waist suit. And there is
another material. And this is the soft
fancy wool goods that lie upon every
counter. There is no special name for
this goods. It might be a cashmere
were it a little lighter and It might be
a camel' # s hair were it a little, woolier.
It is simply a fancy wool" "goods and
just a? pretty as it can be for the win
ter, shirt waist suit.
How to .Make Your Own Gown.
Now as to the making up of your
gown. Be sure to make it a two-piece
suit- Let the lower part be a skirt and
let It be tight around the hips and full
around the foot. The box-plaited skirts
are excellent. Let the box plaits be
very small all the way around the hips
and let them be stitched flat, right
down over the hips and half way to the
knees. From the knees let the skirt
flare nicely.- This is both sensible and
fashionable.
Let the upper part of your suit con
sist of a shirt waist. It should be made
upon the accepted shirt waist models,
rather loose in front and very tight in
the back and on the hips. Below the
waist there should be a little skirt
coming down just over the hips. Or
the coat can be a little longer, as long
as a Louis XV coat.
The shirt waist suit, when made with
a, little skirt like this, very closely re
sembles a coat and skirt suit. And,
on very cold days a washable shirt
waist can be worn underneath. Made
in blue camel's hair cloth and cut so
as to be open at the throat, such a
suit is considered one of the smartest
of the season.
% And, speaking of winter shirt waist
suits, one. must mention again the new
shirt waists that have been made for
the royal bride, Princess Cecelia. The
Princess, who has Just seen her. eigh
teenth birthday, is devoted to the shirt
waist, and one of her prettiest suits
Â¦ is made of brown broadcloth, with fit
ted skirt 'and shirt waist. A Louis XV
skirt is fitted to' the shirt waist. And
this costume will be one of the smart
est in the royal trousseau. .
The New London Coat.
1 All England is wearing the seven
eighths cloak. It comes almost to the
heels and it Is made of melton, serge,
broadcloth and heavy men's suiting.
It is a masculine looking coat when un-
in the waist arid full again in the
skirts.
But, though It is a season of coats
and of severe modes, it is also the sea
son of shirt waists and" there are new,
shirt waist suits to delight every heart.
" Here, is the new shirt waist suit just
as it will be: seen.
It is a winter suit and it is made
either of velvet orof soft wool goods.
There, came- fancy wools specially for
this purpose and if you want to be
smart you will look around until you
find a soft wool that will just suit your
purpose. liHi!
" The colors from which to choose are
pavement" gray, granite, London^ smoke
and gun metal gray. Or you can have

BY AUGCSTA PRESCOTT.
LL Europe is at work upon the
f I trousseau of Cecelia, bride-elect
Â£j of the Crown Prin.~e of Ger-
JL many. "It is not every day that
a future Empress marries," confided
one modiste to another as she ordered
her work girls to put an extra row of
hemstitching in the ruffles of a deep
greecn taffeta gown.
Gowns have been ordered from all
over and each country is to furnish its
epeclalty.
Trom America the Princess will pro
cure her sailor hats and her washable
ehirt waists. The firm which has this
contract in hand will send the first
epring shipments of these goods.
And from the United States she will
procure her shoes. All her dainty
house dippersâ and the Princess has
the tiny foot of the Russians â will
corne from the United States. Here
alto she will procure her pretty art
nouveau silks, and the will get her
belts here. Surely a long distance to
come for one's trousseau, but nowhere
else can one find one's own specialties
as in America.
Then from London the Princess will
procure her tailor-made dresses. All
the beautifully fitted cloth gowns will
come from London. And from Paris
che will get. her hats. Her embroider
ies will come from Japan and her lin
ens from India. She will wear the
laces of Ireland and France. And her
evening gowns will be made In Vienna,
that home of the artistic dressmaker.
For her trimmings ehe will visit Ber
lin, an 1 ! particularly for her bead work.
Here she will set all the pretty little
odds and ends which are of ,such great
assistance In the designing of a hand
some gown, and -which the women of
3<eriin make so deftly. And with these
the. Princess will manage to secure as
tine a trousseau as can be got together
In the wide, wide world.
There Is a story whispered about
' that the Kaiser, anxious to secure a
handsome outfit for his future daugh
ter-in-law, offered to 6et aside a sum
for her trousseau. But this was firmly
though kindly, refused" by the Duchess
of Meckleuburg-Schwerln, mother of
the Princess, on the ground that it was
wholly unnecessary- The Duchess, by
the way. is one of the handsomest
Â¦women in EuroiÂ»e and by far the,be3t
tiresser in royal circles. As a Russian
Grand Duchess she was known for the
magnificence of her wardrobe. It was
she who conceived the idea of having
one gown made in each capital of .Eu
rope. And this is being carried out
faithfully, each modiste making a gown
â¢which Ehall be ideal. The Paris gown
is a fluffy creation in pink and black.
WTieu she weds Germany's
future Emperor, Cecelia will bfe
gowned in historic laces, but the
prettiest gowns of all lie in the
numerous trunks now being
packed for her Royal Highness.
Shirt waists and shirt waist
suits and wonderful long cloaks
to be worn for da}* and dinner.
Paris Ireland, England and
Russia ransacked to supply the
newest fashions for the coming
bride.
with countless bands of white velvet
ribbon no wider than a straw.
Her Trousseau Is of Blue.
"The Princess / is immensely fond of
laces," chatted a Paris couturiere to
your correspondent, the other day, in
a smart "Maison" on the Rue de la
Paix.
"You will notice this," and she spread
out upor her slender fingers a bit of
lace line as a webbing.
"We shall take this fine lace and ap
ply it to an antique lace bolero. And,
then, we shall set a flounce of real point
lace underneath. It is all in* cream
color, as you see, and it is to be worn
over a handsome grown of turquoise
blue.
"The Princess will "not have many
evening sowns, for life in the German
l>alaco will be yerj* quiet and her Hi^n
t ness will wear pretty neglige-js and
handsome street dresr.es rather than
elaborate party gowns.
"The trousseau of the Princess Is
nearly all in blue," chatted the modiste,
lifting a gown of navy blue cloth from
a chair. "She selected blue out of
compliment to the Kaiser, whose favor
ite color it is. The Kaiser loves blue In
all its shades, and Princess Cecelia has
ordered that it be the keynote to her
trousseau. One lovely gown is all of
blue spotted net over blue silk, while
the bodice is in blue taffeta, with net
over it.
"The Princess, who is very young,
will wear her first trained dresses after
her marriage. One charming carriage
dress is in military blue, trimmed with
pipings of Oriental silk. There is a
vest of Oriental goods and. for a coat,
the Princess will wear a handsome
Louis XIV coat with long tails and
handsome stiff cuffs lined with scarlet
"Many of her gowns have a touch of
Bcarlet.' It may be only in the buttons,
or In the facings, or in the pipings, or
perhaps there is the slightest touch of
scarlet in the lining, visible only when
the 6kirt is lifted or when walking. But
It Is a fact that the scarlet note is seen
In almost everything.
"The Princess wears the fashionable
English seven-eighths coat. : This coat
is not so fashionable in America, where
a shorter coat is more to the liking of
the active American girl. But in France
and England and in Germany it is the
coat of. the year.
"What will the Princess do in the
matter of sleeves?" you ask.
"Most of her gowns are made with
high shoulder, puffs slightly, modified in
various ways. One of them has the pull
caught around^ the arm by. a ribbon
tied in a . bow. Another has the puff
tucked and brought in ' tightly..; to the
arm. And another has lace set Into the
puff, making It less pronounced.
Her Laces and Xeck Ruffles.
"Will the Duff sleeve return? I am
often asked. Most certainly! :
"You ask regarding the number of
gowns of the bride of the Emperor-to
be. Weil, the English royal family
have been generous to thePrincess and
bo have the Russians,' and ' it ' is likely
that she -will take Into Germany the
handsomest trousseau ever given a roy
al bride. Her beautiful Russian mother
has sent to Russia requesting. the Czar
to Bend her the ' laces, : which are hers'
trimmed, but it can De given many
feminine touches.
A seven-eighths broadcloth coat of
deep brown was faced with white satin
with a wide band of antique lace cov- .
ering the satin. The collar was a
square affair in Persian cloth and the
cuffs were made of Persian. Great an
tique 3i!ver buttons trimmed the front.
Gray Is worn a gTeat deal, as well as
brown.
. It was old Grimes who used to wear
&n> old gray coat all buttoned down be
fore. And the woman Gf to-day is copy
ins him. Her newest cloak is in pave
ment gray and it is buttoned from the
chin to the floor or almost to the floor.
Its buttons are handsome metal but
tons and its trimmings are gorgeous
effects in Roman, in Armenian, in Hun
garian and Scottish plaid. Many are
the different kinds of goods used to
trim these gray cloaks and there is no
limit to either the color or the variety
of material. One handsome gray cloak,
was trimmed with medallions in red,
yellow and blue.
What did women' do before the Per
sian and other Oriental stuffs came in?
Howdld they dress? How did they get
along for cuft*s? "What did they do for
collars and belts, for stocks and lin
ings, for facings and foe trimmings?
How did they manage to make effective
vests and by what manner of means
did they contrive the cunning little
yoke effects and the gorgeous appliques
which are so much the style this sea
son?
The importation of the Persian stuffs
marked a wonderful advance In the ar
tistic quality of woman's dress, and
when the domestic manufacturers took â¢
It up and outrivaled the foreign makes,
then. Indeed, the results .were fine.
One can now at a very little price buy
enough handsome silk in the -wonder
ful Oriental colors to strap a gown, to
pipe it, to trim it with bands and head
ings and to make the neatest of vests
and cuffs. Or one can go in more heav
ily and make the gown largely of this
material. [
A woman who is known for her taste
in dress is wearing a suit all In pave
ment gray. There is a gray cloth suit
with skirt that Is tight around the hips â¢
and flaring around the foot. Over this
falls a three-quarter gray coat, but
toned with handsome silver buttons.
And, then, there Is a pavement gray
felt hat, rather floppy In Its outlines
and trimmed at the side with & bow of
black silk. A pair of long gray gloves
completes this costume.
A very becoming suit is In green
serge, strapped with brown silk and
trimmed with mink for winter wear.
Green and brown make a very smart
suit. .
There Is, a pretty combination which
is becoming: very popular. Gray is
jvorn, relieved by dashes of robin red
breast red. The gray coat is faced 4
with this vivid color and a gray felt
hat is made lively by gray wings set
smartly in the front.
For walking up Fifth avenue of a
morning when all the world of fashion
is out for Its constitutional, there come
very smart gray felt. hats and hats of
brown felt. These have large irregular
brims and they are untrimmed save for
a wing, which is set right in the mid
dle of. the front. One very pretty brown
hat. turns up In front and is caught
.with a wing.

be. able to sleep eight hours and still
have sixteen left for labor; meals were
supposed to be taken standing tip. Fur-:

In these days of strenuosity in the but

on the front seat \ of the .wagon before

appeared '. to . be. Interested- in almost
anything except the business "on which
they were supposed to subsist. For in

â¢As he had been Â¦ instructed by; " his

two or three trumps up his sleeve and
that their hands wouldn't be worth

Still they kept on !n their career of

It's all over now, and our great and
unimpeachable regard for the. glorious
cause of truth compels us to state that
the game didn't Â¦ turn out In Just the"
way that William Henry had planned.
He had it all fixed to consent to take
over the business as soon as his late
employers should be poshed Into bank
ruptcy; when it occurred to ; him that
it, took caSi^to buy a grocery store. He
wasn't organizing a steel trust, and
real money -was a sine qua mm. Wil

out the lights and lighted two little

"Just right now for the fifth noc

to find some interest in the attempts
of the other guests to amuse them
selves.
In sheer desperation he was perus

about orphans, and dreamed night and

business alone appealed to usâ -the
wild, tumultuous ride In the cars, the
street parade behind a band and the
plaudits of admiring congregations.

Many towns and villages in that
plenteous region threw open their
doors to the little strangers. Car after

thousands of firesides and reform

to forgotten dead In distant burial
grounds. But the supply far exceeded
thi demand. In time the tide of East

the troches,- but more likely "basket

to do with that drumhead complexion.
For some reason the show fell with
a D. S. thud. It must have been on

THE SAN FRANCISCO ,; SUNDAY CALL.
ON AND OFF THE BREAD WAGON
BEING HARD LUCK TALES AND DOINGS OF AN AMATEUR HOBO
FABLES FROM THE FOOLISHMY DEAR PROFESSORâ I have been told by Uncle
Silas, who is now visiting me, that you were disappoint
ed in my letters; that you hoped I would write to you,
my old professor of sociology, on topics which would
show that I have profited by my opportunities to study, in
a-great city the science in which you grounded me at the Sacchar
ine Academy. I am glad to have this frank criticism by you, and
equally would have welcomed it if you had made it" to me instead
of to my uncle. But I do not admit that my letters lack sociologi
cal value. I do not recall that in any of your lectures, nor in the
text books, the science of social phenomena â sociology,â - was de
fined as social development of the lower strata of society, rather
than in the strata nearer the top. Concerning the latter I cer
tainly have written to you at length. And why riot? Is it, as the
political demagogue, the sensational press, would have us believe,
that the lower classes alone are worthy the consideration of
thoughtful men? No! In botany, do we neglect the rose be
cause of its beauty ;,the violet, because of its ; sweet perfume ?
Why, then, complain that my letters have'beem largely about^tjie
roses and violets of society, instead of ill-smelling; weeds? The
latter have their uses and their place, no doubt, but have not the
rose and violet as well? -
Uncle Silas is disposed to be merry at Â¦ what he asserts is a
great change in my views of life, which . he attributes to the Â¦ fact
that I find myself possessed of greater aptitude for agreeableness
to people of my own class"than to the submerged class of whom I
once, he reminds me, thought. so highlyâ theoretically..
"Reuben," said Uncle Silas to me the other day, "the only time
you attempted to address an audience: of the lower class you had
to thrash your hearers before vthey would listen to you. V You find,
t ... ..Â¦ P â¢ . ... ... - â¢ - .. . Â¦ -.1
however, that, audiences of your own class will listen to you with
out the help of the police to make them do so, arid therefore you
have become an aristocrat, a butterfly of fashion, a devotee of -the
futile 5 o'clock tea, a connoisseur in the arts, a follower, of the foibles
of the day." ' ". . ' .;
Sincethe arrival oi Uncle Silas I have been engaged more than
ever, if possible, in society duties. He s is, as you are aware, a
preacher of the gospel of doing things, and, in truth, does every
thing" but sleep; thus, finding^ it possible to work all day^ with af
fairs in the financial district arid. participate most of the' night in af
fairs of the ; polite set in which~L am now a notinconspicuous mem
ber. His sister, my dear Aunt Sarah, claimed" his evenings exclu
sively for a time, but of iate he has accepted engagements I
have rriade for ; him, and these usually include Mrs. : Lacquerre and
her' daughter ;, Frances. This was after Uncle Silas : remarked,
"Pear;Sister Sally"--mearJng my aunt-â "isfa bit too persistent; in
mulling the ; subject of \ your rriarriage ? to Â¦ her daughter to be en
tirelyentertainingto a "man somewhat. inclined to mull the subject
of his own marriage." vN V }
"WHat !" I exclaimed, laughing at the -absurd \ thought. "Are
you.; seriously thinking of ; marriage, ; Uncle : Silas?,""
; Â¦ "Why not, Master^Impertinence ?"^he -â¢ responded.; "The 'Â¦- rto.
sonl'ninot^married*is because I've not-had'time.to commit matri
mony.' I've been too busy making, my own; fortune and increasing
yours; to give* the hour; I; suppose one sliould: devote to the choice
of a wifeâ or finding a girl who'll have him. I believe I could
take an hour off for the purposeâ if I got up uncommonly early one
day." ggSPili? - "
"I . have often thought of your marrying Mrs. Lacquerre, Uncle
Silas," I said to him, "and with pleasure, for she has been such a
good friend of mine ; but, really, it will be a*cruel turn to deprive
me of my best chum. Couldn't you find some one else who would
suit you as well?"
He replied," looking at me whimsically: . "That is the most
selfish speech I ever. heard. Here are you, making suit to the
daughter, yet you want also to retain* the mother as a friend â an
unmarried friend! However, if you seriously object to my marry
ing Mrs. Lacquerre, and depriving you, thus, of your chief adviser,
promoter, chum and guided I will look around this little old island
of Manhattan to see what else offers. Â¦> You promise not to object
to my second chbice, whoever she may be?"
I responded in the same half serious vein that I would urge no
further objection, but that I could not, with fortitude, think of Mrs.
Lacquerre marrying. . â¢ Â¦ Â¦
In truth, such was the fact. Although I am still decorously
pursuing my suit for the hand of Miss Frances â with no more
success than at first â -it ir. with her mother I find myself n;ore
often thrownin companionship.
But here am I, my dear professor, writing to you, although
my groom informed me some time ago that my saddle horse was at
the door, and I must be off on a promised canter through the park
with Mrs. Lacquerre. Miss Lacquerre will not accompany us, as
she has promised to lunch witji Uncle Silas in the city, and after
ward attend with him a meeting of bankers, whereat he is to
make an address. My engagement calls, so y I shall postpone the
conclusion of this letter until a later hour.
It is a later day instead of a later hour, but I assure you that
my time has been so filled with matters of the greatest importance
that no thought of letter writing has been possible. And, as you
shall see, the affairs which have occupied my time were of a sin
gularly distracting nature. I spoke of the canter through the park.
When it was over Mrs. Lacquerre graciously said I might lunch
with her and entertain her until the return of her daughter from
her engagement with Uncle Silas. I experienced lively pleasure
from the prospect of an uninterrupted afternoon with the lady.
At lunch and for a time afterward we talked of affairs relating
to our social plans. Our plans, L say, for during the last few
months we have, insensibly, merged our plans; she advising and
helping me with mine and making them part of her own, I holding
myself ready at all times to assist her in any way a man may be
useful in such .respects. But soon we were talking of other things,
of her wish to travel abroad again, and the hindrance Miss Lac
querre was to her plans. "I wish, Reuben," she suddenly exclaim
ed, and with unusual earnestness, "that you'd hurry up and con
vince Frances that you are the man she should marry and take her
off my -hands. Then I'd have leisure to do a little independent
planning for my 'own amusement. Won't the girl have you?"
Some emotional impulse made me ask, "Then are you so anx
ious that I should'marry Frances?"
"Of course I am," she replied stoutly, but she blushed as she
said it, and I quickly insisted. "If Frances married some one else
it would affect your liberty as well as would her marriage to me."
"To be sure," the lady assented. "But I'd like to have Jhe
thing over with. I could marry, too, if Frances were off my
hands." ,
"And would you then marry?" I asked with meaning.
"That is not for you to ask," she replied, and I saw, as.
much from her tone as her words, that she understood the per
sonal application of my question and was steering away from an
embarrassing topic. In short, my dear professor, I will say in so
many words that Mrs. Lacquerre understood me to ask; by indi
rection, if there were hope for me in her favor should Frances
marry some one else. The situation was involved ; I was the
avowed suitor of the lady's daughter, yet confessing that my old
love for the lady had returnedâ if it had ever gone !â and half con
vinced that the lady looked upon me with approval, certainly
with more favor than upon, the occasion of my astounding first of
fer of marriage to her. But what could I do? I was bound to
pursue my suit of the daughter so long as there seemed a chance
that I might succeed. Yet. I was tortured with doubts as to my
'standing in the heart of this lady I truly loved, but to whom I
was in honor bound not to make another proposal of marriage â cer
tainly not until I should be finally refused by her daughter. It was
in a most unhappy state of mind that I said to Mrs. Lacquerre:
"If it should turn out that I am so far from your daughters ideal
of a husband that I must abandon my suit for her hand may I be
gin to try, humbly and patiently, to win your love?"
. Mrs. Lacquerre's pose of manner is brusque good nature. She
is disposed to deny any sentimentality, affects and seeks to convey
the impression -that she, is as hard within as she is polished out
wardly. I, of course, long ago saw through this mask, saw that
she is a lady susceptible to many emotional moods, is as sentimen
tal as she is witty, and affects otherwise to 'prevent appeals to that
concealed side of. her nature, yet, knowing this, I was still unpre
pared to see tears in her eyes as she replied to my question : "Oh,
the^ deuce of it is, Reuben, that you need not begin to try to win
my; loveâ you've won it already!"
Then, to my immeasurable surprise and distress she began to
weep, and .hurried from the room. I sat in a daze of happiness
until she returned, and smilingly said : "There! I've made a fool of
myself, and perhaps it's done me good. It's all over now â I hope it
is; for I've* powdered my nose â so we'll never speak on the subject
again. Now let's talk about- â the weather."
I understood, 1 and plunged into talk of impersonal subjects/but
:..we were 1 progressing indifferently when a servant entered and
gave Mrs. Lacquerre a telegram. She opened and read it, and
became as one stunned. Seriously alarmed, I. rose to go to her as
sistance, for she seemed likely to fall from her chair, but sudden
ly she began to laugh, somewhat hysterically, crumpled the tele
gram into a ball, tossed it to me and, for the second time, hurriedly
left the room.
The telegram, dated Philadelphia, read as follows :
"Frances and I married this afternoon.

AMERICA'S GREATEST FOOTBAIvL TEAM-
By "Walter Camp
For one tackle there is Newell of
Harvard, who figured as the star tackle
of three All-America teams.
The other choice would be Hector
Cowan of Princeton, a captain and one
of the most powerful men who ever
played the position- He figured on the
All-America team the first year of this
roll of honor, but would have filled the
place ia ths previous years had there
been such selection made.
For guards the choice would be

All-America, teams of 1S8S, 1839 and
1890. and that phenomenal guard.

Pennsylvania, in the All-America teams
of 1J97, IS3S, 1S33 and 1900. under other
conditions would undoubtedly have
been an equal selection to these two,
and would have been chosen as many
years as he played on any first-class
team, but he was not played as a
guard, but in moat of Pennsylvania's
big games was called upon to do prac
tically all the running (all. at any rate,
that was effectived with the ball, and

all this, he was called upon to do the

would have been able to pull out a good
many victories for his team, but forced
to do all the work himself, and with
abilf*v to always be with his. runner,
whether in striking the line or after the
runner was through, and his strength
in dragging that runner along, meant
many yards for his team.
Gordon Brown of Yale also a selec
tion for four years on All-America
teams, would be . chosen without a
doubt were it not for the phenomenal
giants already noted.
Heffelfinger of Yale has stood out
for years as the king of the guard po
sition. He was a most powerful maa
in build, without any superfluous flesh.
and was a remarkably fast runner. So
fast, Â¦ indeed, that at one time, when
Yale was in great difficulties as to the
question of securing an end. the pro
ject was considered of playing. Heffel
finger at the end of the line, and he
was quite fast enough to perform the
work, being even from bis position In
the line one of the . first men to ret
down the field under kicks. He was
not only a strong player, but a strat
egic one, and he had studied the possi
bilities of Â¦ his position until he had
made far more -of It than had ever
been made before. He was not used In
running with the ball, because Yale's
system has always been based Â¦ uoon
the idea that the guard. If he perform
his work properly, has so much to do.
especially In defense, that it fs hardly
worth while to exhaust him unduly .by
giving him more running to do on the
attack.
Glass of Yale Â¦was on All-America,
teams ths only year he played and was
the reliance of the Yale line in that
year, always being ready, f ortunately
for himself and the team, to perform a
good deal more than the lion's share of
the work. Like Heffelfinger, he carried
no superfluous weight, but was a fciz.

be asked.
choice for the All-America teams for
three years. Both of these men were
captains and successful captains.
Frank A- Hinkey of Yale was one of
the most remarkable ends that ever
played the position In this country. He
was on the All-America teams of 1S91,
1S32. 1S93 and 1S94. He secured his
position at Yale when a freshman, and
although he was by no means athletic
in appearance nor of muscular build.
h* displaced all tbe other candidates.
This frail appearing man, weighing but
147 pounds, was probably the most
ft-ared by his opponents on account of
his ability to diagnose and get through
any kind of Interference that was sent
against an end. In addition to that he
pessessed that most valuable charac
teristic of an end, intuition as to where
the plays were going and ability to be
always on hand when the ball came
down. His career was one of steady
progress, resulting In his final cap
taincy of the Yale team.
jCampbell of Harvard was the choice
of the All-America, team in 1839. 1900
and 1501. He was a man of muscular
build, although not as heavy as some
of the more modern ends which the
recent changes ra rules are developing,
but he was very powerful and fast in
getting down the field. His especial
forte was in assisting his own runner
In attack, and in . this he stood oat
above all other . ends of his time- Â« In
fact, it is upon this quality that "he
would be given the place. There were
few ends who might match, him ia de
fensive work or In getting down the
field, and none of them were quite his
equal in tackling, while his particular

the West Point- Anna polls game for
his side, has the longest and most
phenomenal record of any- of the
quarters. Beecher of Yale, one of the
best remembered- quarterbacks, ante
dated the selection of the All-America
teams.
In the back field, McClung^of Yale,
of * the All-America . teams of 1SS0
and 1391, was the best, all thlng3 con
sidered, of any of the men who stood
is the uosition- '
One end would be Hinkey , of Yale,
who was the choice for that place on
tht All -America teams for four years.
There is no other man who has cov
ered that position in such a way as to
be thus chosen or recog-nized.
The other end would be filled by
Canto bell of Harvard, who was the
WHEN asked to eelect an all-
America, team of the all-
Anierica * teams â that Is.
to piik out the stars of
seen a. palaxy of players as
have made names for themselves on
the gridiron since the original selec
tion of this kind â the task seemed at
fj-rn Impossible, says Walter Camp in
the Independent. And It is impossible
if one were to guarantee that this
ttarn, when finally chosen, should be
able to work together and be success
ful withoui considerable practice.
Having seen an all-star aggregation at
New Haven on the occasion of the
Yale bicentennial, although It includ
ed players as far back as those who
represented Yale teams in 1S75 and
18TS. actually smother the regular aec
ccd eleven of the university, I believe
that even such a team as this might
b+ able, after some practice, to get
tcpether and play a powerful game.
Nevertheless, the present selection Is
intended to cover more nearly the men
r/ho are regarded by football enthusi
asts as the best men who have played
i.t the various universities during these
many years.
The freshman takes his seat besiie his
set-ier brother and dia^noÂ«es the situ
ation with the seasoned composure of
a veteran collegian- On that day. three
months in ~~>ge, cr three years, cuts
little figure.
It is no welder, then, that the whip
ping cf the big- team into shape is
watched with absorbing interest. The
evolution year after j-ear of the raw
recrcit from an unknown Quantity to
the padded wender in the red sweater
with the big "S" is, with a few slight
variations, vÂ«ry much the same old
story- It is only the eequ*l that Is ever
No sooner does the player find him
self familiar with the elementary tac
tics cf the ?isÂ« than he is plunged
into the thick cf it- There is at first
the prosaic catching and passing -f the
ball, there is blocking and tackling,
tarkiins and blocking. Then husky
Ogata bejrin to dodge and dive and
circle about h!m. K* feels every mus
cle tingling, evcrj- brafncell brought
into fecticn. As the season advances,
the days grow shorter, and the shadoxra
on the gridiron prow long and faint.
By this ilnae.he has gone through the
various match g-an-.es, he has made the
Team, and before he knows it the
Cfesse, the Biz Game, which above all
.-ifc*rs must be wen. is at hand.
" irut this process of evolution is too
complex ta te summed up in a few
sentences. From the tinze the men sign
\ip tor th* sguad until the call to the
big game is a neriod of eight cr ten
weeks. During that time material has
to be weeded out and molded Into
shape. There can be no fa
voritism. Every rr.an Is given to under
stand that merit alone counts. The
American university is the most demo
cratic institution in the world, and the
football field is the most democratic
part cf the American university- It is
democratic, yet the training of the big
team is a graphic Illustration* of the
law cf the survival of the fittest. Not
that there are any weaklings among the
candidates; among the fifty who signed
vp tor the varsity this year at Stan-
ford every man may develop some
strong points peculiar to himself. But
the big team demands the best of the
best.
As soon as college opens in the fall
active preparations begin for the com
ing intercollegiate game. In fact, no
?ccner is one gme over than specula
tions are afloat as to the outcome of
the next contest â speculations which
must, however, be of an ethereal na-
ture. While it may be foretold with
reasonable certainty how many of the
old men win return to college, the loss
of one or two players may be irrepar
able. Even after the eleven is some
what definitely formed into shape al
lowances have to be made for acci
dents to the players, and for that fatal
Nemesis to many an aspirant for the
big S â the ax of the committee on
scholarship. These are the things
which combine to throw an element
of uncertainty up to the very final out
come.
The signing up of the men for the
squad marks the formal opening of the
football season. The event is not per
mitted to go by without appropriate
ceremonies. It is made the occasion for
thÂ« first outward manifestation of col
lege spirit o( the year, and the speeches
that are made and the cheers that are
given for the success of the year's team
are distinctly characteristic of college
life. Nowhere, can you find such a col
lection of lusty, yelling humanity as at
a college football rally. There ia a spon
taneous enthusiasm about it an reveal-'
Ing the moral support that is behind
the playersâ the kind of support that
edges a man an to give his university
the best that is in him. Let the rooterd
give the "big varsity" a few times, and
every man forgets his own individu
alityâforgets everything but the team
arid victory.
The first two weeks of practice mark
the first stage in the evolution of the
gridiron performer. During this period
he is instructed in the rudiments of- the
game and pat through light and easy
work. Fifteen minutes of ~gym" work
dally serve to loosen up the muscles.
On the field the work consists In punt-
Ing, catching, falling on the ball, and
other light exercise. This year nearly
eighty men turned out for the first
football practice of the season. The
candidates were divided up into two
sctua<j3. irrespective ef freshmen or old
men, and these were in turn divided
into those tryin? for backfield positions
and those trying for punts, while the
ends, tackles and guards were started
down the field, two at a time, after
the ball. Besides this, there was the
handling cf kicks, and running down of
punts by the iine men-
Two or three weeks after the opening
of the season the match games with
outside teams begin, and the football
season U in full swing. It ia not. how
ever, until about five weeks after the
work of training has commenced that
the varsity begins to form into shape.
By this time it is pretty well settled
who will make the -team, although a
man may not be certain of his position
before a few days of the game.
The team now begins to work more
and more on the offense, where team
play 13 more essential. Where there is
individual playing, the team may pre
vent their opponents from scoring, yet
would find it dif3cult to sccro them
selves. But with the development of
the team into a unit the offense is
strengthened and the chance of scor
ing Increased.
At thi3 time the team begins to de
velop from a collection of individual
players to an aggregate whole. They
begin to get what Yost used to call the
"football instinct." The plays are
rounded out well, and there is a dash
and vigor that arouses the enthusiasm
of the bleachers, i The bleachers are
there to give moral support and en
couragement, and they play a mighty
part in the deveto-pment of the team.
Let the bleachers let loose a few old
style yells, and yoa notice immediately
the increased dynamic of the players.
The bleachers are there" to yell, and
the players are there to play football,
and it Is wonderful how much a yell
can do sometimes to urge on a touch
down.
Every man must dispense with the
us.: of tobacco.
"I come with the sane ell soc? about
training rules," said Trainer Jlsulton
at .the opening rally. .*"I wast to em
phasize one thing â that a3 seen "as a
nan sis^s Ids came here to-night ha
goes into training, and hs nr-s-. keep
th* rules faithfully. I know it means
hardship, but the game and the finish
are well worth i:. To th? new men I
want to say that I can tell If you break
training rules even if I don't see you do
It. Your work will show It on, the field.
and the firsc thing- you know you -will
be taken c2 thÂ» field and you won't
know why. -You can't succeed any
ether \sayT'
Much depends upon. the_ spirit la
â¢which men. go about the â¢work. "Three
things." said Coach Lanagau. "should
be Understood as being absolutely es
sential to success. The first of these
13 good spirit. This means that when
a fellow ia told to do a thing he must
do It right away, and he must do it
in the best spirit. In the second place,
we must have a crowd of men that
â¢will fight. There arÂ© plenty to fight
fairly hard, but thi3 year we have nien
who will do- a little better than their
best. This was well illustrated during
one of the recent games. In that gams
there was a man who had not kicked
more than forty yards, but when It
s-as up to him he kicked sixty yards.
That's the kind of men we want.
Finally, the men must absolutely kee?
the training rules. They must not
smoke cr chsw. and they must be la
bed by 11 o'clock. Any one who breaks
these rules will be sent from tha Cell
at once."
"Itfsa peculiar thing." said Trainer
Moulton. "that In the development of
every team there is a certain period
when the men grow stale. Toa can't
account for it. but you can always fig
ure that a month cr so before thÂ» b!g
game the team slumps. The prelimin
aries show up poorly, and ther* seems
to be a general retrogression.
"As to nervousness, my ex^vrirze*
has been that the men will shew mcr*
scare Just before a preliminary thaa
before the big game. The team never
shows up at its best at a preliminary.
It is only at the big game that ta* aÂ«
are lined up for royal battle, and It Is
oc!y then that each maa brings out thÂ»
best that is in hira."
An incident is teli by ens of the old*
time players which shows that football
men are cot the crsly ones who ! gst
nervous en the night before the game
The team had beea taken ta en* ef
the country botsl3 la thÂ» neighborhood
to rest up before the big contest. The
hotel was crowded, and It was taxpes
sible to find accommodations f^r all
the men. There was on* room, how
ever, which was still vacant, hut whlca
the landlord refused to let out under
any circumstances. "When cressed for
a reason, he explained that the bus
occupying the adjoining room was so
extremely nervous that hÂ» could not
bear the slightest noise, and that he
had paid to have the room adjoining
his own kept vacant. After much ar
dent argument the landlord finally con
sented to hare two ef the players oc
cupy the room, but -only on the solemn
premise that they refrain from T-piV+wg
the slightest disturbance. Everything
went off according to the progranime
until one ef the men. while retiring.
drc-pped one cf his shoes with a terrific
thud. loud enough to be heard around
the house.
There were moments of agonized sus
pense. Fifteen minutes passed by and
our player wa3 congratulating hfcrself
having thus easily escaped, when a
nervous, jerky voice from the adjoin
ing room blurted out. "D-dâdamn It.
why d-d -don't yea hurry up and drop
that other shoe?** .'
There comes a time at last when the
prr-ces3 cf evolution Is complete.
Months of toil, grind and hardship
h-ve amalgamated into a mechanism
a3 nearly perfect as anything human
can be. eleven separate entitles that
had nothing in common save grit, de
termination and strength. The heart
breaking hour and a half U at hand
which 13 tw test the metal that has
been so long tempering. The "Big
Team" has been whipped Into shace.

FEATURES OF THE. GREAT, PUBLIC CHARITY OF PARIS.
My family has no claim on me and can raise no objections. They have
shown me only envy and. jealousy. It is with a sense of utmost gratifica
tion that 1 leave what I have to people who have done me neither good nor
harm."
Some seek' an atonement One suicide. writes: "If I have resolved to
leave this world it is because extreme weakness no longer allows me tc.
bear bravely the load of my slow and painful existence. My remorse *rt :
committing an act. contrary to religious law leads me to hope that God will
forgive meT* ;38BH
General de Laumlere, killed before Puebla In the Mexican War, was
pursued by compunction for having left a tailor's bill unpaid. "I beg my
father." he wrote, "to seek in Paris one- Jaquet. who was'ray tailor in 183L
I think I must owe him 500 francs. If he or his heirs can be found 1SQ<
francs are to be given them. Otherwise 2000 shall go to the Paris poor.**.
Mew Plan Under Consideration.
Some slight dissatisfaction Is expressed on the part of the poor as to
the management of their property, and a project is now on foot in virtue of
which the method of distributing money may be somewhat modified. The
minimum income allowed is. indeed, only two and a half cents a day given
to those who have other means. This sum. it is said, is too insignificant to
be of any utility, and yet It Is distributed so generally as to represent at the
end of each year a vast amount which might have been of real value to a
more restricted number. /
It is, therefore, proposed to divide the poor into four classesâ the first,
those incapable of work and without any resources, numbering 6000, to re
ceive $6 per month; the second,. those able to work only a little or having a
very modest income, numbering S000, to receive $4 per month; the third,
those having employment or an Income just sufficient to keep them alive,
numbering 26,000. to receive $2 per month; and the. fourth. 15.500. Including
widows,- divorcees and women abandoned by their husbands, from $1- to $2
per month, according to the circumstances. These classes represent, of
course, only those who depend entirely or largely upon the public funds,
and would not cause prejudice to the other branches of the administration.
For this reform more money than now exists would be required. Nearly
$1,000,000 In addition would "be i needed each year; and the Assistance Pub
lique is waiting for some more legacies .to come In before approving Km
Â¦ plan.'
i for the poor. ' Over $3000 is spent each year on the care and extension of
museums to instruct the poor; $2000 on books for them, and $2000 in giving
them postage' stamps to communicate wltl their .relatives. No less than
$155,000, is devoted exclusively each year. to helping poverty stricken moth
ers, who might be tempted to abandon. their young children from inability
to feed them. . .
All septuagenarians have the right tola minimum pension of $2 per
month. .Others,, old or weak, or. poorly .paid, their employment,
draw pensions * of from $1 to $4 per month. ; If they fall 111, they
have theirphyslclans at their, call; if the case is serious, they have hospitals
and sanatoria at their disposal. Fifty- thousand Parisians depend absolute
ly for their income' upon this system; lOO.OOO^are more than h-lt. dependent
upon'it. , Six'thousand children are supported, ,hour- :, fed and educated;
20.000 are furnished with means while left with relatives or friends.
Fortune Left for Sugar Plums.
Although the Assistance Publique has. generally speaking, a free hand
in managing the rich estate' of the Paris poor, seme testators have speci
fied precisely what use is to be made of their money, while others have Im- .
posed conditions, failing the fulfillment of which the sum would be for
feited. Hospital beds and scholarships are the uses most frequently or
dered. Butothers^are of more y unexpected natures. One worthy woman, who
died an oldmaid, left an income" of $40 to be given each year as' a dowry, to
some deserving girl. Numbers have since {followed- this example, leaving
sums varying between $40.and:$200 to be ; given as dpwries for marriage or
learning; trades. YvA sentimental widow bequeathed $134 per year to be spent
In* buying sugarplums for the poor. More ..' practical, : a man named '; Moreau

On the back of the carriage was now
inscribed "Married at last." The sig
nature was the same.
Meanwhile some ribald scribe had
scrawled in chalk upon the back of
the bridal carriage, "Not married yet,"
and â¢ signed it sacrilegiously with the
name of a well known gentleman whom
no persuasions can lure to his home.
Once again the bridegroom made his
way to the chancel steps and this time
he did net ' wait in vain. The bride
kept her appointment, the marriage
vows were exchanged and the happy
couple, drove away for the honey
moon.
The best man hurried to the bride's
house, only to find that she had gone
down, town shopping earlier In the
morning. From shop to shop he traced
her until he saw a carriage with a pair
of grays waiting outside a barber's.
He rushed in to find the hairdresser
sporting with the tangles of Neaera's
hair. " Hurried explanations followed.
How could a girl go to be married,
without a coiffure worthy of the occa
sion? asked the bride. The barber said
nothing, but pointed to his work as an
ample justification of the delay.
'At length the bride yielded to the
best man's importunities and fixed an
hour in the afternoon for the cere
mony.
"When 12 o'clock struck the bride
groom fled from the church amid the
giggles of the waiting congregation
and, sitting down upon the curbstone
outside, bitterly lamented his loneli
ness.
The hour of 11 had been decided on
for the marriage of the son of a local
tradesman to a young heiress. The
day had been fixed several times be
fore, but the bride had shuddered on
the brink of matrimony and the wed
ding had been postponed.

LONDON, Nov. 5.â The Duke of Marlborough bitterly resent3 the sale
in the picture shops of the duchess' portraits by Helleu. The other after
noon he went into a Bond-street shop and demanded by what risht the
proprietor put the duchess' picture in his window. The shopman explained
to the angry duke that Helleu had the copyright of the picture, and that
dozens of the duchess" portraits already had been sold.
The duke left, declaring that he would take steps to prevent Helleu from
selling any more of the duchess' portraits, remarking that he was paid for
the original, and had no claim to make further profit out of a private por
trait.
Something like consternation has been created at "Woodstock by the
report that the duke intends" to close Blenheim Palace for two or three
years and leave the whole, place in charge of caretakers, the duke's family
living at Sunderland House. Blenheim was closed by the late duke for sev
eral years, owing to money difficulties, but when the present duke married
Miss Vanderbilt it was considered a sure guarantee that Blenheim would
be kept open. _ .' ~
The explanation offered here is that the duke and his father-in-law do
not get on together, and this, it is declared, is not "W. K. Vanderbilt'* fault.
but the duke's. It Is known that the duchess felt bitterly over giving uo
country life, as her happiest moments are passed at' Blenheim with her
children.'
PARIS, Nov. 5â Rich, indeed, are the Paris poor! They possess in their
'own right real estate bringing in abouf $300,000 and stocks and bonds bring
ing in $250,000 per annum; they enjoy from various sources a clear in come of
over $7,000,000; they have at their disposal hospitals, sanatoria, asylums,
schools, lecture-rooms and private physicians, pensions for old age or illness
of disabilityâ and all this not, as In other cities, to*1>e solicited as a favor,
but coming to them as their due after the simple formality of proving them
selves paupers. ; â¢ .â¢
The truth is that no Parisian need be a pauper unless he wants to be.
The fact that from a total of 2,714,068 inhabitants 500,p00, or nearly one-fifth,
are largely dependent upon the general" revenues and institutions of the ad
ministration for the poor would seem' sufficient evidence that whatever the
number of beggars one may meet in the streets few really require help.
"While the Paris poor came by their wealth honestly,- through donations,
legacies and state and city subventions, the care of the vast' property thus
represented could naturally not be left to the poor collectively, or to any in-,
dividuals among them. So an organization known as the Assistance Publique,
with officers appointed by the Government to look after the paupers' wealth
and invest it and distribute Its revenues in the fairest possible way, was de
vised. That was nearly a century and a quarter ago. and through subse
quent revolutions, republics and monarchies it has continued to the present
day, with few modifications in its line of conduct, save that the sums to be
handled have quadrupled in recent years. â¢'?**Â£
Great Wealth in'Keal Estate.'
At the time of the revolution in 1793 a law made it obligatory for the poor
to. receive each his share of the general income. But the directorate decided
that forcing money, upon people was a little too radical, and the rule was
established, still in force, that the money and privileges belonged to the
poor, but they must apply for it and prove their poverty. .
The real estate owned by the Paris poor and controlled for them by the
Assistance Publique" represents an area of nearly 3.000,000 square feet. Thirty
years ago the area was almost double this figure, but in view of the increased
land values the administration judiciously sold here and there and invested
the proceeds otherwise. The property includes seventy-seven large houses in
Paris and numerous farms in the suburbs, as well as 346 gardens and grounds
in Paris. The houses are rented for $200,000 as schools, factories or apart
ments, whereas the grounds are leased at $82,000 for all possible purposes. By
the ingenious leasing of privileges, such as passage through certain grounds,
w-lndows allowed in the walls of adjacent houses, etc., an additional $5000 a
year is netted.
The hospitals, asylums, home schools and other establishments run for
the,benefit of the poor from their own funds necessitate numerous inciden
tal expenses' such as printing, sewing,, the manufacture of shoes and
brushes and market gardening. The Assistance Publique found that it cost
practically no moreto slightly Increase the output and -by selling the sur
plus therÂ«um of $90,000 per year.is now realized. Even the leavings of bones,
grease, peelings and bread from the various establishments are preserved
and sold; "netting. $13,000 -annually.:"
Use to Which Money Is Put
.There is need for. every penny of this money, the expenses attendant on
the comfort of .the poor being enormous." To begin with, there are thirty
two hospitals in" Paris and twenty-eight asylums, some in the capital and
others rest-resorts at the seaside or in the mountains, which must be looked
after. Then there are pharmacies, butcher shops, laundries, supply stores

GENEVA, Nov. 5.â Within the last
three months no fewei; than 270 dogs
have been chot by- Italian customs offi
cers on the Swiss-Italian frontier
while in the act of smuggling tobacco,
furar and salt from Switzerland.
It has beccine almost impossible
for men vo carry on smuggling: without
being caught, and consequently they
have taught dogs to do the work. The
animal is first taken to an Italian vil
lage near the frontier, where he Is pet
ted and well fed.
After some weeks of this the 'dog is
taken to the nearest Swiss village,
where he is half starved, and where a
man in the uniform of an Italian cus
tomi officer gives him an occasional
beating. B^B
After a few days of this treatment a
parcel of tobacco is fastened to the
dog's collar, and he is set free.
' He immediately makes for the fron
tier to reach his home on the Italian
side, and when he catches sight of an
Italian customs officer he remembers
his beatings, and does his best to avoid
comic Â£Â¦ near him.

Last week Pioneer Lodge celebrated
its removal from the A. O. F. build-
Ing to the Red Men's building by a
house warming after the close of the
business session. During the session
there was read a letter from the su
preme president, who thanked the
lodge for the active work it has done
for some time past. In this she art
nounced that if the lodge will secure
a certain number of candidates and
initiate them within a stated time the
Supreme Lodge jwill give Pioneer a
handsome bonus. The lodge decided
to do what it can to secure the bonus.
Before the close of the session the
lodge initiated four, strangers and re
ceived two applications. After the
close of the lodge there -was an ad
journment to the dining-hall, where
a supper was served, . after which

preme officer and those who accom
panied her were received" with a gen
uine fraternal welcome and they were
shown how well ea<*h set of officers

the credit of each there was not one
that was deficient in the memorized
and ritualistic work. The reports of
the several lodges as to membership
were most satisfactory and showed an
unusual increase In membership, as
well as in finances. It also appears
that the supreme body is not only In
a healthy numerical condition, but
that its treasury has more -than $1000
to the good.

PARIS, Nov. 5.â The latest freak in
Paris fashion is the "cache mirere," for
the autumn between-season weather.
These charming wraps, to supplement
thin dresses and hide makeshifts before
the. winter costume is bought, are made
in luxurious materials,- falling' in folds
like classical drapery. They are most
suitable for drawing-room use. The
sleeves generally are mere holes for the

The Milky Way is, I believe, a mon
ster coal chute of stars, all pouring
into the heart of the sun to keep up
its energy. That theory is as good aa
any other. The whole thing is guess
work. When a man seriously con
templates the wonders of the solar
system his mind approaches vacuity.
His head feels light. Thought be
comes dizzy. Drunk on astronomy!
We are told by those who have got
nearest to the order of creation that
the sun is 100,000,000 years old. The

The following letter from Wallace A.
Sabin will give a much more pictur
esque account than I possibly could of
an event of exceptional interest to us
that took place at the World's Fair last
week. Mr. Sabin. as every one knows,
is organist of St. Luke's Church, and,
as some do not know, was the Califor
nia representative of organ-playing at
the World's Fair. Mr. Sabin writes me:
"I thought you might like to know
something of my doings at the fair, so
here are & few details. My recitals took
place last Monday and Tuesday, Octo
ber 24 and 25, the management cour
teously giving me the 'hour of honor"
for them, 11:30 a. m.â that is at which
time the Guilmant concerts have been
given. It was most gratifying to me
that, though the hall was* colder than
charity and so very many other attrac
tions were going on outside, the large
audience remained almost in toto to the
bitter end. It was actually so. bitter
that my fingers almost froze to the
keys! Another thing that pleased me
much was the. fact that not only the
lighter things gave pleasure, but at the
end of the prelude and fugue in D
minor (Bach), when one naturally ex
pected Just polite acknowledgment, they
recalled me so often I thought I should
have to repeat it.
"The organ was completed only a few
days before I arrived at the fair. You
know it is California-made, of course,
which reminds me of my amazement
that so little comment has been made
on the fact. The instrument is certain
ly immense in all senses of the word â
beautiful in tone, balance and action;
in fact, in all its features, and is in
spite of its inevitable complexity (there
are 140. stops) not difficult to manage.
"I had much less time than I could
have wished to get familiar with it. We
poor victims who had to play were
obliged to get in our practice when we
could. One man would have It from 9
p. m. to 12 p. m.; the next from 12
p. m. on; In fact, the organ is going
twenty-four hours in the day. Then
when one did get one's turn there were
all ports of annoyances, amusing
enough In the recounting. People would
form a ring around you, with requests
for favorite hymns and for anything
â¢with a tune. Then they would ask hosts
of questions and swamp you in ejacu
lations, until finally driven off by the
ever watchful Scott-Brook.
"On Sunday, when I really thought I
should have peace, !o! they put up
eighteen stoves in the hall, silently, of
course. However, in the evening I got
another "go" at the organ, and In the
morning felt reasonably sure of. my
work. This destroyed any fear of nerv
ousness, and I am glad to feel that I
really did myself full Justice â in fact.
I never remember playing so well. And
the next day was better, if anything.
The programme was more popular and
took better. I was especially pleased
as being the only California organist to
be heard at the exposition I naturally
Â¦wanted to be a credit both to my State
and myself."
I am sure Mr. Sabin will pardon this
printing of his St. Louis adventures. I
found it so interesting that I wished to
share it. I have since seen the organist,
who is full of the splendors of the
California organ. Recitals have been
riven twice a day at Festival Hall,
where the organ stands, and by many
of the most famous organists of the
time. Alexander Guilmant, the well
known French organist, contributed no
fewer than forty recitals. Middelschulte,
one of the biggest figures among Amer
ican organists, and Edwin Lemare, per
haps the most eminent of English
speaking organists, were also among
the players. The programmes have
been remarkably good. In only a few
instancesâ and these Mr. Sabin says
bear alarmingly celebrated names â has
there been any playing to the gallery.
The audiences, again, have been grati-
fylngly large and appreciative. It may
interest to know that 10 cents at first
and afterward 25 cents wastcharged
for admission. v ' *
And, as our Calif ornian representa
tive says:
'There are now a great many more
people that know that an organ does
not consist wholly of a front row of
pipes; that something besides the 'Old
Hundred' has been written and can be
played on it. and that an organ has
been built In California of which any
builder might be proud."
Here follow the Sabin programmes,
on the first of which will be noted two
compositions by Calif ornians. Mr. Sa
bin himself and W. H. Thorley. and
two arrangements by"Californians. the
Grieg "Cowkeeper's Tune," adapted by
Dr. H. J. Stewart, and the Wagner

Just what, besides a "front row of
pipes," the Los Angeles organ consists
of,' the official programme of the con
certs announces as follows: "The grand
organ in Festival Hall is the largest
and most wonderful organ in the world.
It was built by the Los Angeles Art
Organ Company of Los Angeles, Cali
fornia, It is 63 feet long, 30 feet deep,
50 feet high. It has 140 speaking stops,
99 mechanical movements, 10,059 ' pipes,
ranging from % inch to 37Â»,2 feet in
length. The largest pipe weighs 840
pounds and is 17 inches in diameter.
The largest wooden pipe measures 23%x
28 inches inside and weighs 1735 pounds.
It has a set of tubular chimes. The
combination switchboard has 1616 elec
tric switches, capable of producing 17,
179,868,183 distinct tonal combinations.
The organ contains 130 miles of electric
wire. 1SG0 magnets, four motors aprgre
sratinp: 23^ horsepower, fills 12 large
furniture vans and weighs 250,000
pounds."
It does not here state that there are
five manuals â choir, great, swell, solo
and echo, and that all this is probably
going to Kansas after the fair.

HalL Many people are desirous of
hearing what this wonderful little lady
has done within the last year. She
seems to have made something of a
sensation in her concerts in New York,
in which she appeared some time ago,
and her work has doubtless gained im
portantly since then. Twelve years
F-nid now counts, not many considering
the following programme, however it
is handled:
It is rather unkind of Mr. and Mrs.
Fred S. Gutterson to go over to Berke
ley to give their first recitals since
their home coming. One wanted to
hear them. One wanted to hear what
Harold Bauer and Pablo Casals, with
whom this clever couple studied in
Paris for the better part of a year,
have done for them. But they must
needs pass us by for Berkeley. They
are to give there a series of three Tues
day evening recitals, on Tuesday next,
on December 6 and on January 10> at
the home of Sfr. and Mrs. Allen F.
Fr-eman.
On Friday evening next the first con
cert of the Minettl Orchestra will be
given at the Alhambra Theater, and
the event is awaited with much inter
est. The orchestra numbers upward of
100 players, and contains in Its person
nel most of the well-known amateurs
of the city. .". very interesting pro
gramme has been provided. If the
work of the orchestra at all equals
that of last season it should prove an
excellent evening's entertainment. As
sisting the orchestra will - be MI33
Grace Freeman, Miss Katharine John
son, Miss Grace Muller and Miss Wini
fred Wright. The programme will be
as follows: Auber, Maxaniello Over
ture; H. Vieuxtemps, Ballade et Polo
naise, tolo for violin; Massenet, Le
Dernier Sommeil de la Vierge, for
strings; Bazzini, Symphonic Poem
Saul; Bizet, Carmen Suite.
so became in last Sunday's reading,
with the result that the listener was
tired out in attempting to follow the
lost 'lines of the string structure
drowned out by the pianoforte."
"Mrs. * Mansfeldt, for the time
seemedto have overlooked the very
quality that , made her playing in the
same quintet so interesting last year,
viz.: the nice balance of tone between
the sonorous pianoforte and the less
resonant strings. In order to cope
with the mere noise (that is the proper
word) produced by the heavy baas of
a Steinway grand with open pedal,
the strings should have been at least
doubled; and even then the cello would
be mostly inaudible unless reinforced
by a contrabasso. Sinding can scarce
ly have intended that his string part3
should be lost whenever the pianoforte
bass gets a chance to let loose. Had
that been Intendedâ that the" strings
should merely support the pianoforte
part in a display of virtuosity and
overwhelming tone â the parts would
have been written quite differently,
viz.: in masses and broad effects, and
not in polyphonic treatment, imitative
figures and so on.
"Quite true it is that the pianoforte
part of the quintet is of itself very
showy, but that is only additional rea
son why the pianist should exercise
great discretion, in order' that the
.quintet may remain a quintet and not
become a pianoforte concerto with ut
terly inadequate accompaniment. It

aort, but of such exemplary badness,

But I am glad* to have missed the

most pleasing elements, it. will be re
membered, was the discovery of Mrs.
Oscar Mansfeldt, before . known only
as a soloist of the brilliant order, as
an ensemble player of- peculiar deli
cacy and discretion. Her work of last
Sunday, whether the result of unwise
counsel or what not, seems to have
been in curious and unlovely contrast
with its last season's distinctions. Here

To-morrow the St. Francis win bÂ«
the scene of a brilliant reception to
be given by Mrs. Grayson Dutton.
Dr. William A. Martin entertained
ai dinner yesterday In honor of Major
Shlete and Dr. and Mrs. Shlels. The

being laid for fifteen.'
The return of Miss Maude Younger
after so long an absence from home*ls
a cause for much warm welcome Â¦ and
will be further celebrated by many af
fairs In her honor. Though several of
this city's fair daughters are. well trav
eled and conversant with European
manners and ideas, there are few. who
desert for so long a period as has Miss
-Younger. She has positively prolonged
her foreign stay into years, so that San
Francisco Is little more than nominally
home to her. Still, she will enjoy her
stay with old friends, even though there
is small likelihood of her taking per
manent residence here.
with the advance of the season. Wed
dings, teas and luncheons are following
fast. One of the small though pleas

last Sunday by General and Mrs.
Charles Austin Coolidge in honor of
Lieutenant Campbell Batcock. U. S. A.

view, three hostesses gathered about

Kelly and Mrs.. George Borneman. 'Tis
said these "children of a larger growth"
were ; as â¢ happy and well-pleased with
the entertainment as a younger 'gen
eration- might have been.
The departure of Mrs. Warren Olney
with her daughter, Miss Ethel Olney,
while a matter of congratulation, for
them is still a cause for regret among
their many â¢ friends. But - the spirit of
"speed the parting guest" is upper
most, and amid the farewells there
have, been recently many affairs of
pleasure given to the two travelers.
Mrs. and Miss Olney -will tour Europe,'
stopping in many Eastern cities en
route. Mrs. Warren Olney Jr. recently,
invited several of the closer family
friends to bid adleux. Among those
who received with her were Mrs. Ed
ward von . Adelung, Mrs. Walter Hart.
Mrs. Louis Bartlett. Mrs. J. . K. Mc-
Lean, Mrs. Bayata, Miss Wellman and
Miss Mary Williams.
Though 'tis paradoxical . that buds
should blossom in winter time, the
truth of this matter still asserts Itself,
and every day proclaims a new flower.
Miss % MarJor!e Greenwood Josselyn
(what a pretty name!) made her pretty
bow to the world of merriment yester
day. Mr. and Mrs. Charles Josselyn
held tea and received the congratula
tions of their many friends for this
winsome daughter's introduction. In
January Mrs. and Miss Josselyn will be
at home on second and third Fridays.
If there's a handsomer young matron
In town than Mrs. Louis Pierce It has
not been my good fortune to see her. A

cloth gown, with a large white hat and
violet veilâ a Whistler picture.
Miss Isabelle Kendall is the most
sought after maid in the burg over the

Miss Maud Smith and her mother,

home full of reminiscences of charm

larger cities the ladies were delightfully
entertained, but with all the allure
ments of travel they were "glad to get
back"â the San Franciscan's refrain.
Friday night was the gladdest, mer
riest night of ' all, for* 'twas genial
Ned Green way's birthday. As on all
other natal days within the memory of
his friends, Mr. Greenway gave a din

Then came the first big dance of the

mother the ships of nations that come

such as were encountered when the

both an army post and a naval station

George P. Farmer and John A. H.
Umbach were booked at the City Prison
yesterday by Detective Bell and Police
men Moriarity, Wilson and Tobin on a
charge of robbery. The complaining
witness is Charles Blocker, clerk In the
checkroom at the St. Francis Hotel.
Blocker and the two defendants lived
in a lodging-house at 28 Eighth street.
Farmer, who was employed In the en
gine-room at the St. Francis, occupied
a room with Umbach. Blocker says
that last Sunday night about 9 o'clock
Umbach knocked on the door of his
room and entered. After lighting a
cigarette Umbach asked Blocker to
show him a photograph that he kept -in
his trunk. Blocker opened the trunk
and took out the photograph.
The trunk had been left open, and
while Umbach was looking at the pho
tograph he gave a peculiar cough and
Farmer came into the room. Blocker
6ays that Farmer pulled a revolver out
of his pocket and pointing it at Blocker
said: "Now we have got you just where
we want you. If you don't give us some
money we will blacken your character."
They began to empty Blocker's trunk,
and while one carried his clothing and
other articles to their room the other
kept him covered with a revolver. After
taking his watch from his pocket and
leaving him nothing but the clothes he
was wearing they left the room, threat
ening to kill him if he said anything to
the police.
Blocker was so afraid of their threats
that he kept his mouth shut, but when
they called upon him at the hotel late
Wednesday night and again threatened
to blacken his character unless he gave
them money he determined to notify
the police the following day. This he
did. Farmer was arrested on Friday
and Umbach yesterday afternoon. In
their room and on their persons when
searched all of the property taken from
Blocker was found and it was booked
as evidence against them.

Small Boy Disappears.
Mrs. Hutchings, wife of Thomas
Reed Hutchings, living on Powell
street, near Lombard, notified the
Harbor police station yesterday that
her 11-year-old son, Lloyd, had dis
appeared last Thursday. Hutchings,
who is a lumber longshoreman on the
water front, left home on August 1
and has not been seen in the city
since. The mother thinks her hus
band haa taken the boy away. Hutch
ings is a drinking man and left home
under the influence of liquor.
Â¦ m Â¦
When a Princess appears in public
with her mother she wears an apolo
getic look which every one under
stands.
This breaking down of the strict
wall of censorship and giving to ,Â¦ the
public the news, regardless of cost,
illustrates what is being done to give
the public reliable news of the great
current events in the world's history.
It has been the policy of Melville E.
Stone, now head of the Associated
Press, to use the cable as freely as a
school girl would use a free telephone.
Formerly but a few words would have
been wired around by way of London
and full accounts would follow by
mail. Now, without asking for per-,
mission, reliable correspondents send
thousands of words direct from the
seat of war.
The correspondent haa been absent
six months gathering this information.
A correspondent is kept at Chefu and
the news he sends out, though reliable,
is not authoritative, owing to the
secrecy of the Japanese Government.
The Japanese, finally realizing that the
Associated Press was carrying noth
ing but reliable news, finally permitted
the correspondent at the front to send
through an uncensored message de
scribing in detail what had been done.
He immediately chartered a boat, went
to Chefu and handed his copy to the
Associated Press representative there,
returning at once to the firing line.
From Chefu the story of the battles
was forwarded to Shanghai, thence to
Hongkong, where it was relayed to
Manila and turned over to the Pacific
Cable Company for transmission to
this country.
For six months a representative of
the Associated Press had been with
the Japanese army before ; the " forts,
enduring the hardships of a soldier's
life, subsisting on the same fare as
the sturdy little fighting men and tak
ing the same risks. During all this
time not a word had been heard from
him by the officers of the association.
Suddenly there came an -intimation
that there was to be a Btory.
Without waiting to "query" as to
the number of words he would be per
mitted to send, this enterprising news
gatherer placed a message on the wire,
which in its condensed form consisted
ot 4374 words; when the articles,, ad
jectives and conjunctions were sup
plied at this end of the line there was
a graphic descriptive story of about
7000 words, giving the information
â¢which people have so eagerly sought
but heretofore have been unable to
obtain. To show the enterprise of the
Associated Press arid its willingness
to obtain the news at whatever cost
no better illustration ttan this is re
quired. The cable tolls alone for the
4374 words at 36 cents (gold) per
word Is a considerable item.
One of the greatest achievements of
modern journalism and one that shows
the far-reaching effects of combined
efforts, was the story of battling before
Port Arthur; printed in The, Call of
Friday morning. A graphic;descrip
tion of one of the greatest sieges the
world has ever seen was carried by
cable a distance approximating 8000
miles. The message was the longest
one that has ever been cabled across
the Pacific.
. Captain Burnett detailed Detectives
Brai? ' and Mulcahy on the case and
yesterday they submitted their report
to him. They ascertained that Harris
was a theatrical man and had been on
a tour of the Orient, the Philippine
Islands and the Antipodes. In his
company was 'a very beautiful woman
known as Carmencillia, a serpentine
dancer. Harris was deeply In love
with her and she seemed to recipro
cate his affection.
While the company was at Shang-
Unrequited love seems to have
caused Sherman Harris to com
mit sculcide in his room at
the Metropolitan Hotel 129 Third
street, , on Friday. He, was found
in an unconscious r condition t and
taken to the Central Emergency 'Hos
pital,- where he died. Death was sup
posed to have been due to opium pois
oning. An autopsy ivas made on the
body at the Morgue, but as the cause
of death could not be determined the
stomach was sen 'o the City Chemist
for analysis.

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S note to the powers, proposing a
second peace conference at The Hague, has met with a
favorable response from the nations. The President has wisely
chosen the time to move forward" toward the future peace of .the
world and redflce the chances of war. The British-Russian arbitra
tion is an object lesson, which will cause this second conference to
eclipse the first by extending greatly the issues that may be with
honor submitted to arbitration.
The rate of progress toward peace may be estimated by the
fact that ten years ago the British public would not have tolerated
the submission of the North Sea affaiu to arbitration.^ Even as late
as our Spanish war, .which was really caused by the sinking of the
Maine, the American people would have hooted an i administration
that would have suggested arbitration. It is \ not \ forgotten that the
American branch of the Universal Peace Society was compelled
to retire from public .view and conceal itself because it exchanged
notes with the Spanish branch, looking ,-. to a peaceful solution of
the issues that soon culminated in war.
Another fact is of the greatest interest. Peace is made by
soldiers. Grant was, a man of peace and promoted it, though the
greatest soldier of the age. President Roosevelt has served ; his
country in arms, has taken part in war and is accused by his
enemies of loving war, but he becomes the instrument of a great
movement toward the world's peace and permanent tranquillity.

KISSING BUG â Subscriber. Sacra
mento, Cal. The cornenose, or "kiss
ing bug,"- is a bug of the predatory
family Reduviride, called giant bug In
the Southern United States, where it is
a pest in houses. It Is three-quarters
of an inch long, black with red patches
on the side, of the thorax at the base
and apex of the wing covers and bands
on the side of the abdomen. The young
much resemble bedbugs, to which they
are allied, and at all ages are fierce
biters and bloodsuckers*, preying upon
Insects and attacking sleeping persons
and animals. The bug seems to breed
in the nests of mice and the insects
are prevalent in the Mississippi Valley
and In the^troples. The name "assas
sin bug" has been given to the whole
family by Comstock by- reason of their
cannibalism and rapacity, and to cer
tain species, especially Mealnollstes
and Reduviride* personat us. which were
specially abundant In the Eastern
States during the kissing bug excite
ment of the summer of 1898.

:V.jA dainty dressing gown is a necessity
for a woman of taste; it may be. quite
charming and elegant without losing its
useful character. There .was a; time
when .there was little choice between
the frivolous peignoir fand the uncom
promisingly hideous or gaudy \ striped
garment, but in these days of beautiful
and inexpensive fabrics there is no ex
cuse for any, one- to wear unbecoming
colors. "Something serviceable" means
to many people chiefly an absence of
color.- A deep, rich 'shade, h6wever,
looks clean and fresh much longer, than
a nondescript' or dingy hue.-. The pre
vailing'color of the bedroom should 'be
taken into" consideration when choosing
a j dressing gown. It if no more trouble
to choose the right* shade and secure a
harmony in your room." A simple gown
of fine, serge or amazon cloth, with a
border of galloon, is pretty and is .very
easily-made.; .
PEDDLERSâ H. S., City. There la
an ordinance of the Board of Super
visors of San Francisco which says:
"It shall be unlawful for any ped
dler or person pretending to be a ped
dler, for the purpose of selling or pre
tending to sell any goods, wares or
merchandise, or any article, material
or substance, to ring the bell or knock
at the door of any residence, dwelling
or building, whereon the sign bearing
the words 'No Peddlers' is printed, or
afflxed*or exposed to public view- Any
person violating any of the provisions
of this ordinance shall be guilty of .'a
misdemeanor and upon conviction
thereof shall be â¢ punished by a fine not
exceeding $500 or by imprisonment In
the County Jail for not more than six
months, or by both such fine and im
prisonment."
In many cases, where soft fabrics
like crepe de chine, velours and mous
sellne are being used, the. skirts will
be allowed to fall in long, straight folds
from waist to feet, the bodices being
also very simply but picturesquely ar
ranged with full folds coming from
the shoulders and crossing in front
under a deep waist belt of soft silk or
satin ribbon.
"Walking skirts will remain short and
full. There are those who Â»hint at a
lining of buckram in the hem, to be
succeeded by whalebone, with possibly
steel as a last resource. Between a
steel-stiffened skirt and ~*a crinoline
there is little difference.
Full skirts will be worn also in those
gowns that are intended for smart oc
casions, although the pleats and gath
ers will be more simply arranged than
hitherto, while flounces and frills will
be fewer in number.,

ROOSEVELT CABINETâ A. C. R..
City. The names of the members of
they Roosevelt ' Cabinet were published
in this department on October 26, 1904.
THE San Bernardino Chamber, of : Commerce 'â¢ has. officially con
demned' the proposition to authorize the issue, of $2,000,000 in
bonds to 'complete the San. Francisco seawall and pay y for it
out of its own revenues.; This action was .instigated by a. colonel
somebody who informed the chamber that it is a scheme ;to increase
the value of the ''vast estates ' in this town left by- C. P. Â¦ Huritington
and James. Fair.. The only â¢â¢.estate in California leftby; Mr.Huntihg
ton was a town ilotin Berkeley. Mr. Fair's water-front; property is
not" near the proposed seawall, but lies on the north side "of the
city beyond Meiggs. wharf.' â¢ '
It is surprising that business. men should be misled by such
prejudice. The chamber solemnly resolved that if the State- is going
into harbor improvements they must be made in - Southern Cali
fornia! The Scripture saith that afool may;be brayedin a mortar,
and his folly will not depart from him. No amount- of trituration
would do the San Bernardino Chamber of Gommerqe anyfgood. The
State is not going^to do anything to San Francisco harbor. It is not
going to do anything to the water ' front of this city. It is simply
going to give the water front -authority to i mprove Â« itself and pay
for ititselT. If the same sort of proposition is made in behalf of any
water front in : Southern; California, there is no man north of the

If California continue this policy, and the State of Washington
exempt American ships, we will see the benefits of Congressional
help go to Puget Sound, and they will not be /elt in San' Francisco.
This city and those around the bay and all on our coast should give
n unanimous vote to this amendment and carry it. Let our' own
flag be free in our own ports, as foreign flags are.
'"INHERE should be no opposition to the constitutional amend
f ment exempting American ships from State and municipal -tax-
A ation. The State of Washington, in behalf of the great ports
on Puget Sound, sought to effect this exemption by a statute. But
the Supreme Court ruled that it must be done by constitutional
amendment, and such amendment is now pending there and will bo
adopted next Tuesday.
It cannot be possible that Californians want to put the penalty
cf heavy taxation on the American flag in their seaports, while our
maritime rival removes it and leaves the flag free of penalty in its
seaports. Our ships compete for cargoes with foreign ships which
pay no State or municipal tax. When ours are burdened by that
exaction and foreign ships are free that competition is not on equal
terms. It would seem as though argument in the matter is unneces
sary.
The proposition is so plain a feature in the general policy of re
storing American shipping that its simple statement should be suffi
cient. Let it be remembered that after the amendment is adopted
the Legislature must provide for its operation by statute, and in
such statute every safeguard can be placed that will prevent improper
bestowal of the exemption. We should certainly make San Fran
cisco and all California ports as free to our own ships as they are to
vessels flying other flags. The equity of it is plain to all who choose
to see. American shipping interests are asking Congress to aid
in restoring the American merchant marine. Anything that Con
gress can do will be materially nullified by States which exact local
taxation from American ships.

The dog Is a great pet and the family,
hoping to save its life, took it to a
veterinary surgeon. He recommended
that the animal be chloroformed to
death, but the owners would not agree
to this and urged that he save its life
and heal its limbs. The dog was put
under treatment and is now almost re
covered. A rubber foot is being made
and will be attached to the Injured
limb. It is expected the dog will have
almost as good use of its artificial foot
as of the original. > ,..

Evansville dog and before long the ani

butter and one-half cup of sugar to
gether, add two well-beaten egg yolks,
one-half cup of water, and one and a

one cup of floured nut meats. Bake In
small buttered patty pans.
French Chocolate â Break a square of
chocolate into small pieces, mix with
one-quarter cup of sugar and two ta
blespoonfuls of hot water; cook until
smooth. Heat four cups of milk In a
double boiler, and when at the scald
ing point add the chocolate mixture
and cook ten minutes. Beat a cup of
thick sweet cream, sweeten it a little
with powdered sugar and add ten drops
of vanilla flavoring. When the choco
late is poured into the cups put a
spoonful of the cream on each.
Potato Border â A potato border for
warmed-over meats or curry of mutton
makes it seem much more than if the
potatoes were served plain boiled. Cook
the potatoes in boiling salted water,
season well with butter, moisten a lit

buttered border mold. As soon as set
turn on to a dish that will stand the
heat of the oven for a few minutes.
Brush over with a beaten egg, set In
the oven to brown and fill with the
meat, fish, or whatever is to be served
in this way.

â¢*^A? ROUND an apple's kernel-core of white
/l_\ I saw a, colored ringâ mysterious sight â
tender pink; it formed a halo fine
As Nature's pencil only could design.
Is it the memory of , the roseate blush
That May had painted with her artist brush
Upon the hearts of myriad blossoms fair.
Which breathed their grateful souls upon the air?
Within a matron's heart still brigtly glows
A sacretf fire, of- which no mortal knows.
Is it the memory of her girlish love.
Which rises, incense-like, to heaven above?
That love unfolded in her spring of life.
When joys around her bloomed with promise rife:
Each blossom bore Love's tender roseate hue.
Now memory knows those colors to renew.

A SEMBLANCE.
President Roosevelt has no other course open than that which
he has taken. The infamous charge was against him personally. It
not only aimed at his private character, but put the President of all
the people in the attitude of a low and criminal conspirator, making
truck of the power of his orifice. His rejoinder clears the air. No
man in the country doubts the -absolute truthfulness of his state
ment, and none knows its truth better than the distinguished sland
erer whom it puts in the pillory. Judge Parker has disgraced him
self and degraded American politics. He has taken his own meas
ure and exposed his size to the whole country. He has humiliated
his party to such a degree that its vindication is possible only by
doing what the national committee has not the courage to do, by de
manding his resignation from the ticket. If this were done' the
party would prepare itself to step into popular confidence.
But it will not be done and self-respecting Democrats will have
no other way of vindicating their manhood than by helping swell
Roosevelt's majority, doing a patriotic service by making it plain
and emphatic that this country has never had a President capable of
the infamies invented and verbally peddled by Judge Parker. All
good citizens wish that the campaign could have closed without the
>hameful incident for which Judge Parker is responsible. He has
dignified Tom Watson and even Debs,* the Socialist, neither of
whom has walked in the wallow where he has chosen to wade.
NO President has ever been more mindful of the limitations and
proprieties of his office than President Roosevelt. Scarcely
any has been more virulently assailed with personal charges.
V\ r hcn he was charged with inciting the Panama revolution and was
dragged daily in the mud of denunciation by the Democrats in Con
gress, he sent all the papers, orders and facts in the matter to that
body, accompanied by a special message in which with admirable
self-restraint he said: "I hesitate to refer to the injurious, insinua
tions which have been made of complicity by this Government in
the revolutionary movement in Panama. They are as destitute of
foundation as of propriety. The only excuse for my mentioning
them is the fear lest Unthinking persons might mistake for acquies
cence the silence of mere self-respect." /
Now thaÂ£ he is a candidate for the Presidency, he has been
subjected to an unusually slanderous attack from an entirely unex
pected source. If it had been made by a partisan pre^ss, or the
underlings who support Judge Parker, it would not have deserved
nor had his attention in a public way. But it had a higher source.
It came from the Presidential candidate of the Democratic party,
who has reiterated it in many speeches in which it was made a
leading feature, to the exclusion of matters of principle and policy.
Though the campaign has lacked in salient features that caught pub
lic attention, this conduct of Judge Parker's astounded the country.
He outdid the yellowest and most sensational of the Democratic
press. Even Colonel Watterson, whose affrighted soul . has seen
terrible visions, laid down his picturesque pen and quit the field as
a sensationaiist when Judge Parker entered it, charging the Presi
dent with engaging personally in a scheme to blackmail money for
campaign uses.
Not only this, but Parker charged that to the vile element of
blackmail was added the President's promise to his victims of im
munity in the commission of illegal acts in order to recoup them
selves for .the amounts he forced them to disgorge. No self-respect
ing man, and certainly no candidate for the Presidency, would make
such a charge in the. absence of proofs. Judge Parker had no
proofs. He was challenged to produce them and failed to do so.
He fell back upon the extraordinary proposition that the President
could do the thing charged, which was evidence that he had done
it! Suppose Judge Parker had been charged with horse stealing,
bigamy, forgery or any other statutory- crime, wath no proof except
that he could do it, and, therefore, had done it, -would not the coun
try have revolted against such campaign tactics? Yet his charges
against the President are of exactly that character, and their repeti
tion in one tirade after another has put him out of the company of
gentlemen.

list, the table pig, the man who never
behaves in public places, whether- 1 in
a hotel or a church. It may be seen
in the fellow who easily loses his tem
per and "sasses back," in the many
painful evidences of a lack of self-re
lance and self-control.
It may be seen in the ill breeding
of women who are Ignorant of taste
in dress and in the social expressions
of real intelligence.
' "Ladyhood is an emanation from
the heart subtilized by nature." To
hear a pretty girl laugh and talk with
painful loudness, to see the evidences
of vulgarity in dress and manner, is to
lead to the conviction that training in
behavior was neglected in the home,
or the school, or the social circle.
Behavior has to do not only with
society, but with life. It is just as
necessary to be polite in business as
it is in society. Many, a man is a bear
in the Â»one and a Chesterfield in the
other. Quoting Emerson again: "The
highest compact we can make with
our fellow, is, 'Let there be truth be
tween us two forevermore.' "
Our culture will be open to the
charge of superficiality until it per
meates behavior in the drawing-room,
the streetcar, the theater, the funeral*
the wedding and business. Worship
itself Is behavior. It Is being polite to
God. It is a proper behavior in the
presence of the Eternal. The first
school of politeness is v the home; ' It
is a question whether children who
are impolite at home will ever be
trained in grace of courtesy outside
of the home. I plead, then, for the
cultivation of a, courtesy which
smoothes down the wrinkles of busi
ness turmoil, oils the machinery of
trade and helps men to live together
as brethren, not as beasts. I plead
for the old, simple virtues of the lady
and gentleman, not for elaborate
adornment and superficial culture, but
for the genuine cultivation of the true,
good breeding are equally necessary
to make you welcome rnd agreeable
in conversation and common life."
Politeness to the English people is
a custom. Because It is a custom it
sometimes loses its influence. The
barber furnishes his shave and. the
waitress her service with a conven
tional but certainly effective "Thank
you." If you were to strike a cock
ney on the nose he would probably
reply with a "Thank you." Naturally
it was an Englishman Who said of
Christ: "He was the first true gentle
man that ever lived." Politeness is
kindness of manner; it is art and re
ligion in one. It was Goldsmith who
said of Johnson that he had nothing
of- the bear about him Lat his skin.
To be a gentleman is to be a Chris
tian, for manners are simply the char
acter turned inside out. The manners
of a people may be seen in the in
dividual, in the toothpick man, the
spitting man, the streetcar monopo-
phian, but the robust man of the
Â¦Western plains, uncultivated - but
rugged; not refined as to expression
in social life, but with a big, warm,
manly heart. 1 He is as manly as the
swift pony he rides. However, it is well
to hold to the general rule that the
manners of a people reflect the spirit
and character of that people. A scholar
may or may not be refined. Some
scholarship is like raw sugar â it has
never gone through the refining pro
cess. Once I took tea with one of;
the great men of the worU. Fancy
my surprise when he poured his tea
i::to the saucer and supped it up like
a child. That little act illustrated his
character and gave me entrance into
a strangely mixed personality.- The
basis of good manners is character
which has been touched with culture.
Chesterfield somewhere writes: "As
learning, honor, virtue, afc absolutely
necessary to gain you the esteem and
admiration of mankind, politeness and
ARE the American people im
polite? This is a question
often asked by travelers,
who, coming in contact with
the people of other and older
nations, are tempted to draw com
parisons not always favorable to the
American people. Doubtless the
older section of the world are better
behaved than the newer communities.
This is true in our own country, but
it does not follow that where men
arc better behaved they are more vir
tuous. It is a rule, but notv without
its exceptions, that manners indicate
the man. They are the thermometer
of character, the outward expression
of the moral nature, but sometimes,
as Emerson says, "they form at last
a rich varnish with which the routine
of life is washed, and its details
adorned." The strongest type -of
American has the poorest manners.

forty-flve, varying in amount. from $500
to $125,000 and aggregating $550,000.
Significant it is that the twenty-nine
.gifts for endowmentsâ many being pre
sented : in the lifetime and' others
through a willâ make a total of $693,000.
It is beginning ' to be generally under
stood that in order that the " public
library may accomplish its 'highest
purpose as an educative force In the
community, it must have permanent
funds of its own. Taxation has its
limits in every city and so pressing
and so Imperative are municipal prob
lems and school extensions , in every
growing place that the. library has its
appropriation not - infrequently Â¦ trim
med , down^ to but lit' le above' starva
tion ; point. The higher institutions of
learning could not exist were it not for
their endowments. The "people's uni
versity," as the public library is often
termed, needs a like assured support.
With this rapid glance at what the
whole country is doing for, free- librai
rles, it is in order to Inquire what is
California's' record of single * in
dividual or organization dona
tions, as shown by this t
ican Library" Association report?
But little space will be required for. the
answer. Excepting the additional gift
of $15,000 from Andrew B. McCreery'for
the completion of ; a , branch library, in
San Francisco, and â¢ with the further
exception of twelve Carnegie -gifts
amounting , to $135,000, there are but
three offerings recorded. One of these
was of $500 from Louis Einstein, to the
Library to be expended for
books; another of $850 from the Santa
Cruz Improvement Society to the Santa
"Cruz Library, and the . third of $1000
from Nelson Carr to the Santa Rosa
library The reported individual gifts'
of money or property to California free
libraries in 1903 : were likewise three in
number, while in 1902 there . was \ but
one, exclusive of the < -.rnegier bestow
ments. ; ""* r
It can hardly be denied 1 that ' this
record of j-'indlyidual gifts throughout
the State of California is insignificant,
especially when ; it Is remembered '' that
a generous stranger has given to* Cali
fornia within- the last twelve months
more than fifty tlmet . much. ; . :
What then is the reason for this lack
of 'liberality? Is it because California
la poor? The \ long list of ." prosperous
cities arid counties havingfbut 'moder
ate indebtedness and a vision of "an as
sessed valuation for the* whole State of
more than one and ; a quarter billions
of dollars forbids this -suspicion. Is'it
because Â¦ Californians are Â¦ not ; of gener
ous nature? Perish the Idea!
.. Glance . ct the Â¦; Ions line , of . gifts be-
stowed on parks in *the large cities, on
churches and societies, and the frequent
moderate sized sums and the princely
benefactions conferred upon schools,
colleges and universities, and there is
no room for such a doubt. One of the
State's prominent men has Justly writ
ten, "The Calif ornian" loves his State
because his State loves hint, and he rei
turns her ; love with a fierce affection
that men' of other regions are slow : â¢
understand." ~ : Seeking further for the
reason of this , general apathy in the
extension : of public ; libray equipment,'
may, it not be found in the_^ failure to
grasp the true Idea of the public libra
ry as an : elevating. . refining power in
our modern life? - Does the great public
yet ' broadly/ understand that the free
library Is one of the four mighty forces
that ; are so , wondrously leavening .and
advancing civilizationâ the , press, the
puipit, the school, the library? When
this view is realized In. all its breadth
there will be a - change, and men and
women of moderate means, as well as
those ; of ; wealth, . will glady : present
their offerings to forward this imper^
ishable influence for / the uplifting !of
mankind.
An example of ; what is realized
when these large views'- prevail * may
be in the financial T exhibit of the
public ' library Boston. At different
periods i -about - thirty, donations ; of
amounts from $100 to $100,000 have
been given to this library, so that the
city of Boston is now the holder of
nearly $400,000 of trust funds for this
purpose. The income thus
realized is of almost incalculable value
in promoting the Intellectual and
moral life of that community:
It is gratifying to know that the San
Francisco Public Library has already
received one gift of *500 and two gifts
each of $1000, to be held In trust. The
liberality of holders of wealth in San
Francisco is certain to find expression
hereafter through' many more 'dona
tions to this â¢ library. Of the smaller
libraries of California the Marysville
Jibrary has thus far profited .most
from remembrances through bequests.
This library has had at least five or six
legacies. of $1000 each from residents
who have known of the difficulties it
has encountered and , have thus been
willing to extend permanent help. In
this particular direction of the acquisi
tion by libraries of ' bequests members
of the legal profession can occasionally
render the finest assistance, for many
a testator when drafting his will de
sires suggestions as to appro ved Â¦ pub
hcp beneficiaries.
'-The impulses of women's clubs alsp
are invariably exerted in behalf of
generous* contributions to public
libraries ' and in many localities "Â¦> no
other Influence is so strong In their
maintenance as well as their organiza
tion. Library clubs and library asso
ciations are each year finding larger
opportunities for service. The press,
too, ia the firm friend of the public
library and no worthy effort for its
welfare falls of its notice. Its readi
"ness to chronicle every donation ia of
great assistance in the cultivation of
the spirit of giving.
As a concluding suggestion it may
not be inappropriate to refer to the
need of establishment of a. branch
library in San Francisco somewhere
in the neighborhood of McAllister am 1
Fillmore streets. The nearest branch
libraries to this locality are respective
ly on Sacramento street, near Fill
more, and on Noe street, near Market.
This distance is so gTeat as to render
them unavailable to many Intervening
residents. Messrs. Fhelan and Mc-
Creery have provided the city with two
beautiful branch library buildings. Is
there another citizen who will recog
nize in the opportunity of erecting a
third one a privilege that may not be
lightly esteemed? Or It may be pos
sible that some of the women'* clubs,
those organizations which are con
stantly wrestling with knotty prob
lems and which seem to take supreme
satisfaction in "accomplishing the im
possible, may lead the way in such an
effort.
WHY are not Californians
individually generous to
free public libraries? Is
it true that the;- are
not? For answer let ex
amination be made of
report of gifts and bequests ren
dered to the American Library As
sociation tor the year ending May
21. 1304. This body has Just held
its annual conference at St Louis,
October 17-22, and before it was pre
sented the most complete account ob
tainable of the late library donations.
Because of Epace limitations this re
port does not quote gifts of less than
IVfO. By the eaid report it appears that
the gifts of the year in the United
States to free public libraries alone, ex
clusive of the Carnegie donations of
$1,500,000. amount to $2,282,000. These
came from 110 single individual givers
or families uniting in single gifts. The
sums given range from $500 to $300,000,
Â¦and have been bestowed chiefly for the
purchase of library sites, for the erec
tion of building* and for endowments.
Xo account is taken in this article of
scores of other valuable gifts of rare
books, maps, manuscripts, paintings,
portraits, natural history collections,
collections of minerals and coins, an
tique docks and memorial windows
which have been presented to public
libraries. This article also disregards
all mention of numerous donations to
societies, schools, colleges and univer
sities, which swell the total sura given
in twelve months to American libraries
of all descriptions to 137,318 volumes,
and of money contributed to $6,103,137.
, Some of the ififts to public libraries
are of almost priceless worth because
of their rarity, as, for instance, a pre
sentation to the . library In Suffleld,
Conn.,* of 2000 volumes comprising one
of the richest antiquarian libraries in
that State. Another of 531 volumes re
lating to the history of Indiana, pre
sented to the public library at Indian
apolis, is said to be the most valuable
on this subject in existence.
* Ten of the donations are for memo
rial library buildings, and they vary
from $3500 to $70,000. It is interesting to
trace the development of this desire to
perpetuate an honored family name by
linking it with ah institution which is
so powerful for human uplifting anu
happiness. Not a year passes in which
the name of father, mother, husband,
wife, son or daughter is not thus ten
derly handed down- to: future . periods.'
California has but one memorial free
library buildingâ the Beale Memorial
Library at Bakersfleld, erected in mem
ory of General Edward F. Beale. -

"Alton Blank Parker was nommynated
be th' Dimmycrats to capture th' Raypubii
can vote, which, sthrangely enough, has not
been" consistently dimmycratic in past
years. At th 1 arly age iv so. Judge Parker,
f'r he it is, suddenly appeared on th' pollyti

at least, he has steadily grown, ontil now
he is beginnin' to talk an' has all his teeth,
but not so rrianny as his opponent or so few
as his companyon on th': Dimmycrat ticket.
Judge Parker's candydacy was first heard in
a whisper, which soon swelled into a roar
fr'm Willum Jennings Bryan. He is a
manly, courageous: man, as his goold tilly
gram wud tend to show. It r-read as fol
lows: 'Boys, if ye've nommynated me an'
there's no backin' out. I'm irrevocably solid
f'r th' goold standard.' Judge Parker is a
frind iv th' wurrukin' man. an*" numbers
such labor leaders as August Bilmont an'
George Foster Peabody among his closest
assocyates. He rayceives thim often as
they "" come up in their overalls fr'm th'
bank. Manny people ar-re opposin' him
because they think he is a man iv too de
cided opinyons, an' wan who. if ilicted. wud
plunge th' counthry into a great an' disas
trous sleep. I won't go that far. While I
think, Hinnissy, he prob'bly exceeds th'
bounds iv caution, ye must raymimber that
he is*a young man. an' that his judicyal
thrainin' has made him a little teeny mite
radical. I'm sure ivry Dimmycrat heart
was fired be his utthrances las' week. 'I am.'
says he. 'irrevocably f'r a goold standard,
but wud sind best regards to Willum Jen
nings Bryan, he- says." 'I denounce thj tariff
as acrool an' un-American nicis*sity.' he
says. 'I abomynate th' thrusts. Oh. if I
had wan here now â I wu.dden't do a thing
to it. But there ar-re good thrusts an' bad
thrusts. - I wud not desthroy thim. What
good wud that do? I wud coax thim.' he
says. 'I wud tache thim to ate out iv th'

LONDON, Nov. 5. â As the succes
sor of the great man who has Just
died, Sir William Vernon Harcourt, his
son, Lewis Vernon Harcourt, is the
subject of much interesting specula
tion. The question is often asked:
"Will he ever become as famous as Mis
father, the last of the Parliamentary
gladiators?" At present he has given
little promise of it. He was elected to
thd House of Commons only last
March, at about the same age,. 41, as
was his father when he made his debut
there. But at that age Sir William
had already achieved renown . as a
vigorous controversial writer and at
the bar had amassed a fortune of be
tween $150,000 'and $200,000, which
enabled him to retire from his practice
and launch himself on the uncertain
sea of politics. Thus far the son has
been known only as his father's pri-

a tribute not- merely to the eminent
character' of 'his public service, but to
the^ popularity 'of \the ; man- himself.
The latte#; was a_ matter of slow
growth. Only Tin" recent" years" have
those v. who : differed V .'from â¢;. him pbliti-^
cally ' come', to recognize' that this Titan
of debate,- so masterful, vehement and
dashing, of ; speech, so : ready v v with the
brilliant and biting. epigram, was really
a man of 'the .most generous and kind
ly'feeling. : But" ln-the -Parliamentary

merciless ferocity.. His ancestors had
been - mighty - warriors -and*- the "same
fighting blood filled . his vei ns. ,
vate secretary and general understudy.
From the doughty veteran he has re
ceived the be3t of political training,
but he* lacked the stimulus of having
his own way to make in. the world.
In features he closely resembles his
father at -the- same age. but, he has
none, of thie latter's masterful aggres
siveness and love of â¢ conflict. Because
of his gentleness and urbanity he was
dubbed "Lulu" at school and as "Lulu"
Harcourt he has been familiarly
known ever "since". \ t It is not a nick
name that suggests*, future greatness.
But men have gone far in public life

HIS WIFE. AX AMERICAN'.
"As a result of this action they have
had no -trouble in collecting from the
city the amounts which they paid for
these purposes" and which the courts
have since declared.. to have been
illegal; .while the smaller taxpayers
have not been able to collect what they
paid, owing to the fact that they did
not file a protest against paying the
game'at the' time at which they paid
their taxes. In this year's taxes there
is included a tax of about 12% cents
on-each $100 of assessed property, or
$1 25 on each $1000 of assessed prop
erty, for; the : purpose of paying the
interest on the new bonds to be Issued
for .public improvements and for the
redemption of the same. The matter
has been carried "into the court, the
claim' being advanced that it was im
proper and illegal to include this item
in the:tax levy of this year.
''Should the courts uphold this con
tention the city would be compelled
to refund the taxes so collected and
those who had filed a protest at the
time of paying their taxes would. have
no trouble in collecting the rebate.
Had it not been for this extra tax,
which had to be collected for the pur
pose of these bonds this year, this city
would have had oneof the lowest tax
rates in its history. The rate would
have' been under $1 53 and taxes
would have been less < 'instead of
greater "than formerly. As it is the
tax rate is about the average tax rate
for the past few years, namely, Jl 65,
and yet the city is raising about
$1^000,000 .for public improvements
and public improvement bonds in ex
cess of the , amount raised for this
purpose heretofore.
"The ffrct that this city is enabled
to raise this year the sum of $1,000,000
for bonds and public Improvements
without increasing its tax rate is due
entirely to the fact that the assessment
rcll , was increased this year on real
estate $87,000,000. Without this in
crease in'/ values all taxpayers would
have been compelled to pay taxes at
the rate of about $1 80, or an increase
of $1 50 in taxes on each $1000 of
property.
. "WASHINGTON DODGE,
' "Assessor."
Assessor- Washington Dodge yester
day; issued a statement calling atten
tion ;to j the" fact that the tax levied
forj the *; interest; and sinking* fund of
the bond issue is now before the courts
for adjudication as to It3. legality and
advising that taxpayers file a formal
protest against that portion of the levy
when settling' 1 their obligations with
the city.V Dodge's statement, which is
se.lf-explanatbry, follows:
<: To the Taxpayers of San Trancisco:
"The first installment of taxes on
real estate is now due. Many taxpay
ers, : especially the smaller taxpayers,
will*, pay without question or pro
test " the amount called for by
their .' tax ' bills. The majority,
if not - all,' of these , taxpayers
are ignorant of the fact, that the le
gality of a. part of their taxes is open
to question, and the courts have been
called upon to pass upon the matter.
Should the courts decide that a por
tion : of "the taxes for this, year have
been illegally levied, those who' pay
the .same â¢ without protest may be un
able to secure a repayment of this por
tion of their taxes by the city. # .

SALT LAKE, Nov. 5. â In Utah the
campaign this year has been marked
by a renewal of the old fight against
alleged church domination of politics.
In the latter days of the campaign the
feeling engendered by this movement
has grown in bitterness. How much
strength will be developed at the polls
by the American (anti-church) party
is problematical.
Both Republican and Democratic
leaders confess themselves entirely at

VIENNA, Nov. 5. â The attack upon
the Italian students at Innsbruck
Thursday occasions great solicitude
here. There is no attempt to disguise
in certain official circles the apprehen
sion that the relations between Aus
tria and Italy, which have been
strained for some time, are now near
the breaking point. It Is well known
that the anti-Austrian feeling
throughout Italy will be greatly in
creased by the unfortunate events of
Thursday, and the public feeling,
which has long been excited under the
propaganda of the Dante Alighieri
Society, may become Inflamed to a
war pitch. There can be no doubt
that, notwithstanding the earnest ef
forts of the German Emperor and of
Count von Bulow to pour . oil upon
the troubled waters, the triple alliance
is practically at an end. The trouble
was revived recently by the failure to
renew the commercial treaty between
the two countries. The Hungarian
Government opposed the renewal be

An important conference was "held
between Sfgnor Tlttoni, the Italian
Foreign Minister, and Count Golu
chowski, the Austrian Foreign Minis
ter, at Abazzia in April. There had
been an urgent demand by the Italian
citizens of Southwestern Austria for
the establishment of a school at Trent
for the purpose of teaching Italian lit
erature, law and history. This matter
was considered with great care at the
Abazzia conference, and the Austrian
representative declined . to establish
the school at Trent, because of his
fear that it would increase the anti-
Austrian spirit in that section, but he
compromised " by establishing an Ital
ian faculty, at . Innsbruck. This . had
the effect of exciting the German-
Austrian students, and there has been
constant trouble between the two
groups ever since,' culminating in the
riots' which have Just taken place.
In July an important Italian nation
alist demonstration - took place at
Trieste, and as a result Â¦ the police
searched the rooms belonging to a turn
vereln society and discovered a number
of bombs.
The Premier, Dr. von Koerber, : to-day
were afraid to go under a modus vi
vendi. There was constant complaint
in the southern provinces of Austria
of ill-treatment of . Italians by the
German element, and of like ill-treat
ment of Austrlans in Italy, which cul
minated in a series of disturbances
throughout Italy some time ago, dur
ing which the escutcheons of the
Austrian consulates in several large
cities of Italy were 'disfigured.
CONFERENCE IS HELD.
INNSBRUCK, Nov. 5.â Rioting on a
large scale recommenced at noon, the
gendarmes using their bayonets. Troops
are coming in from a distance. There
is eome evidence that the authorities
Â¦will proclaim martial law. There is a
body of troops posted in the neighbor
hood of the Italian consulate. f
DENVER, Nov. 5. â Governor Pea
body, Republican candidate for re
election, will close a "whirlwind tour"
by special train with a meeting in this
city on Monday evening. The Dem
ocrats held their last big rally in Den
ver to-night. United States Senator
Thomas M. Patterson making the
principal address.
The issue to be decided at the polls
next -Tuesday is clearly defined. Gov
ernor Peabody, in his speeches, has
explained and defended his course in
expelling the members of the Western
Federation of Miners from Cripple
Creek and Tellurlde by military force
and has pledged himself to the same
line of action in future if re-elected.
Alva Adams, Democratic candidate
for Governor, has promised not to
take sides in labor disputes and . to
hold the troops subordinate to the
civil authorities should their services
be required.
Both the Republican and Democrat
ic managers profess to expect large
pluralities for all their candidates, but
impartial observers consider the re
sult in doubt as to State officers and
Congressmen, with a probability that
Roosevelt will carry the State.
Peabody's Attitude Toward Jllners'
Federation Is the Issue.

Dr. von Koerber telegraphed to the
Burgomaster of Innsbruck as' follows:
"I deeply deplore not only the victims,
but also the excesses of which your
town, ordinarily, so peaceful, has be
come . the scene. I consider It the first
and foremost duty of the Government
to restore complete tranquillity, In
which I count upon the co-operation of
the Common Council . and the good
judgment of all the thoughtful Inhab
itants." '
A memorial demonstration for the
victim of the rioting at Innsbruck,
Prezzey, the artist, who was killed by
a bayonet thrust Friday, will be. held
November 7 in the lecture hall of the
Vienna University. The German stu
dents of the high school decided to
hold a protest meeting the same day.
The War Minister announces after an
inquiry that it is doubtful if Prezzey
was killed by the gendarmes' bayonets,
and consequently, a post-mortem exam
ination of the remains has been or
dered with ,the view of .securing expert
evidence regarding the nature of the
wounds.
A dispatch from Innsbruck published
here . says a railroad official has been
severely wounded by a bayonet thrust.
"The deplorable events at Innsbruck
can only determine the Government for
the present to direct its efforts to the
adoption of vigorous measures for the
maintenance of public order, and this
it will enforce bv-all the means at its
disposal. At the same time, however, it
is impossible ' to adequately condemn
the extravagant agitation which has
preceded the disturbances . and which
has undoubtedly invested them with
their passionate unlawful character." :

Maryland is still doubtful and the
returns will show some Congressional
gains for the Democrats.
Delaware is ' probably Republican,
and Rhode Island, where there is a
great State campaign in . progress, is
believed to be Republican on na
tional issues and Democratic on the
Governorship.
A Republican drift is Indicated from
the Rocky Mountain States.
The Call-Herald estimate of .the
electoral vote follows: Roosevelt, 264;
- As the campaign closes in Wiscon
sin it begins to look as though Gov
ernor La Follette would be beaten, but
the State will go for Roosevelt and
Fairbanks. The canvass was the most
exciting the State has ever known and
the question of the election of La Fol
lette depends on whether he can get
Democratic votes. Roosevelt's plur
ality in the State Is estimated at about
40,000. ' '
WISCONSIN FOR ROOSEVELT.
'The Democrats of New Jersey are
much encouraged and expect to elect
Charles C. Black Governor. There is a
stiffening of the Republican vote on
the Presidency, and the Indicated ma
jority for Roosevelt in the State Is
now placed at ?3,000.
The indicated plurality for Stokes,
Republican candidate for Governor, is
.3700. This is a drop of 50 per cent
in one week and shows that the Demo
crats are gaining as the end of the
campaign draws near.
Judge Parker's tour of Connecticut
has given the Democracy of that State
much encouragement and the State is
more doubtful than at any time dur
ing the campaign. The indications,
however, are that the electoral vote of
Connecticut will be cast for Roosevelt
and Fairbanks. ,
West Virginia, which was last week
classified by The Call and Herald as
uncertain, with Republican leanings,
has apparently swung to the Repub
lican side of the fence. The informa
tion which comes from the State is
that it is strongly for Roo3evelt.
Indiana is still the scene of the
greatest battle in the Middle West-
Both parties are hard at work and
well supplied with campaign funds.
The State is placed in the Republican
column.
The Democrats are better supplied
with money in this State than has been
expected. The amount they have avail
able for use on election day is placed
at $350,000. The Republicans have more
money, and it will be a battle royal in
the rural counties.
The Republican managers are claim
ing New York State for Roosevelt by
Â£S,000 and for Higgins by 40,000. The
Democratic committee estimates claim
the State for Parker by 11.000 and for
Herrick by more than 60,000. The Dem
ocrats expect Parker to carry New
York City by 425.000 plurality and Her
rick by 149,000.

NEW YORK, Nov. 5. â With the
Presidential canvass virtually fln
ishori, the betting on the election of
Roosevelt is 5 to 1, and surface indica
tions point to his success at the polls
on Tuesday next. The Democratic
managers, however, are confidently
claiming: victory-
The Call and Herald have collected
information from the so-called doubt
ful States as to the manner In which
the campaign is closing, and there aru
few changes from the situation of a
week ago.
New York State is in' the balance still
on the Presidency. The State apparent
ly is strongly. Democratic on the Gov
ernorship. It is possible for Higgins
to 'be defeated and for all his asso
ciates on the, ticket to be elected. Both
parties have been very aggressive dur
ing the last week of the campaign, and
this has added to the interest in the
fight. .The sensational passages be
tween President Roosevelt and Judge
Parker "have placed the trust issue to
the forefront of battle.
Issues raised in platforms, in speeches
of nomination, in letters of acceptance
and in literature of the national com
mittees were swept away in a day and
upon the brink of the election the par
ties confront each other with the asser
tion and denial of the two candidates
as the leading feature. What others
have said or may say and what man
agers may claim or deny all goes for
nothing in the face of the remarkable
spectacle of two Presidential candidates
closing a contest with public utterances
of such vigor and directness that no
one can mistake their meaning.
The issues upon which the campaign
has been fought have changed. The
personality of the President and his
public acts, the policy of the Republi
can party on the several questions be
fore the people, formed the basis of
Democratic attack and Republican de
fense.
The campaign just closing has devel
oped into" one of the most remarkable
in recent times. The unusual features
of a candidate attacking his opponent
in office and. forcing him into making a
direct reply, followed by a rejoinder
from the candidate, is a novelty, and
furnished the main topic of conversa
tion where politics were discussed to
day!
The probablitiy is that the next
House of Representatives will be Re
publican by a safe working majority.

"If there was any doubt of the
source of this great campaign fund
it is no longer a matter of suspicion
for EHhu Root,' the former Secretary
of War, frankly admitted last night
that the trusts and corporations were
heavy contributors. He denied only
that -the total amounts thus acquired
or . utilized were as large , as in
previous years. Moreover the Repub
lican candidate himself denies only
that definite immunity from prosecu
tion has been promised trusts for their
assistance.:
, "He declares that he is merely to
give them a 'square deal,' as the
term may be interpreted, not by the
laws of the land, but by himself. -It
is plain that when the time shall come
to determine what a 'square dear
between the Government of the Unit
ed States and the contributing trusts
really the beneficiary of the gener
osity of the latter must either recog
nize their services or confess himself
guilty of base ingratitude."
. Judge Parker never had a more en
thusiastic audience /than that in
Brooklyn to-night. He had not in
tended to make a speech to-night un
til * the ; President issued his statement
defending the' administration from
Judge Parker's charge. The Judge
was engaged most of the day in pre
paring his answer.
; Before taking 3 up his manuscripts
Judge Parker, said:
.' .; "This % is the last opportunity before
the election I will have to talk to a
considerable * number of Democrats at
one time. It gives me pleasure to be
able . to say that the outlook is /very
promising to-night. The party; is in

a 'number 'of- years." ' V"; . â¢ . .:â¢

"He is in a position to "know what
contributions have been made to the
Republican National Committee. If
there had been no trust contributions
he could easily have said so. He did
not say so. He cannot say so. He has
waited until the closing hour, of this
campaign to make easier the pretense
of an answer. But It is not an answer.
It is a confession with a plea of avoid
ance'addressed to a generous people.
" 'That contributions have been made
to .the Republican committee, as con
tributions have been made to the Dem
ocratic committee, is not the question
at issue. Mr. Parker's assertion is, in
effect, that such contributions have
been made for improper motives in
consequence of the act or in conse
quence of Improper promises, direct or
indirect, on the part of the recipients.
"That is the only . paragraph in
which President Roosevelt touches
either directly or Indirectly on the
question as to whether the trusts have
made contributions to the Republican
campaign fund. It is almost in terms
of admission that the trusts have con
tributed to' the Republican fund. In
associating the Democratic campaign
fund with the Republican campaign
fund the President attempted to so
associate the two that a denial of his
assertion could not be made without
implicating the Democratic commit

sounded like the Roosevelt we once
had known. And if he had followed
it by acts In explanation of his words
, it wo-uld have been of far less conse-
I quence to the people which one of us

he did not do it. He shut his eyes to
what was going on and since that
time there have been frequent meetings
of the trust magnates and the moneys
have, been spouting into the treasury
all, the more' freely and all the more
Â¦plentifully because of the attitude tak
en by me and which, it is true, I have
enforced. from day to day.. The. Presi
dent does not ,deny the contributions
now.' This 'is what he says:
Here the speaker quoted at great
length a speech of October 24, in
Â¦which he first raised the issue. He
continued:
"You have learned from its reading
that the purpose of that address was
to warn the people against the cor
rupting of the electorate by tariff
bred trusts and other monopolies. It
contained no criticism of the Presi
dent. It simply called attention- to. a
notorious and offensive situation â a
situation which presented to my mind
the greatest of the moral issues of the
campaign; yes, of many campaigns.
If he had said on the, day after the
delivery of my address, after the con
sultation about it which he ,and Sen
ator knoxIhad:'Yes, I never thought
of it before, but Parker is right.
Why would a trust bring money
out, of its treasury, money belonging
to its stockholders, consisting of
women and children, as well j as men
of both parties, unless its . purpose is
to get something in return, something
which its officers regard as more thai*
an equivalent for the' money' taken out
of the treasury? Now, he is right, and
I am going to stop it 81 Perhaps; the
national * committee cannot " pa"y ; back
Judge Parker said in part:
"The main purpose of my address to
night is to call attention to the fact
that in his strange, belated reply to my
speech of twelve days ago, the Presi
dent has not met the issue created
since the platforms were adopted,
namely: Can the trusts purchase the
election? Whatever results may follow
from hi3 address, the campaign fund
can not be interfered with. It has been
raised."
"I regret to say to you that it then
seemed apparent to me, Mr. President,
that you regarded the election of more
importance than the checking of this
evil."
TEXT OF THE REPI/S\
claration with a statement directed to
the President personally to the effect
that he (Parker) had issued a request
that no money for campaign purposes
should be received, directly or indirect
ly, from any trust: that he rather
would be defeated than to be fettered
in an effort to accomplish reforms that
were sorely needed. He charged the
President with refusing to co-operate
in the checking of the monstrous .evil.
Judge Parker closed that part of his
address directed to the President with
this sentence:

sition as Secretary of the Department
of Commerce and Labor, should have
said:
â¢'I will join Parker, in an _ effort to
protect the -ballot of the honest citi

The assertion was made by Judge
Parker that his charge that contribu

After stating what his position had
been in that spee-ch, Judge Parker said
that he had made no criticism of the

One of the commonest ways of giv
ing fictitious value to stock, and of
selling large quantities of worthless
certificates, is by paying large diviÂ»
dends not out of the actual earnings
of the company, but out of the money
paid by stockholders for their stock.
Stockholders and others, believing
from these dividends that the com
pany is actually prosperous and earn
ing money, either increase their hold
ings or buy stock at high prices, only
to find later that it is worthless. The
penal code provides that the directors
of a corporation who perpetrate this
swindle are guilty simply of a misde
meanor. Equally serious is the action
of directors In knowingly making and
publishing false statements or reports
as to the financial condition of the
company of which they are trustees.
Whittaker Wright (the great com
pany promoter who committed suicide
after being sentenced, to hard labor for
issuing false balance sheets of the
wrecked London and Globe Finance
Corporation) ,was convicted in England
under a statute substantially similar
to this section of the Penal Code. He
was sentenced* to seven years' penal
servitude. Under this New York law
the maximum penalty which he could
have received would have been one
year's imprisonment or a fine of $500.
In dealing with offenses by criminals
of previous good social standing we

his friends or relatives repay the
amount of the theft, in America that

THE ROOT OF THE 5IATTER.
He Cured Himself of Serious Stonmcli
Trouble by Getting Down lo
First Principles.
A man of large affairs in one of our
ITominent Eastern cities, by too close
attention to business, too little exercise
and too many club dinners, finally be-
gan to pay nature's tax; levied in the
lorm of chronic stomach trouble; th^
l allure of his digestion brought about
a nervous irritability, making it impos-
sible to apply himself to his daily busi-
ness and finally deranging the kidneys
and heart.
In his own words he savs: "I con-
sulted one physician after another and
each one seemed to understand my
case, JLmt all the. same they each failed
to bring about the return of my former
digestion, appetite and vigor. For two
yeans I went from pillar to post, from
one sanitarium to another, I gave up
smoking, 1 yuit coffee and even re-
nounced my daily glass or two- of beer,
but without any marked improvement.
â¢'Fritiids had often advised me to try
a well-known proprietary medicine,
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, and I had
often perused the newspaper advertise-
ments of the remedy, but never took
any stock in advertised medicines Jior
could bc-li^ve a fifty-cent patent medi-
cine would tout-h my case.
"To make a long story short I finally
bought a couple of â¢ packages ' at the
nearest drug store and took two or
three ta.biets after tacli meal and occa-
sionally a tafclet between meals, when. I
felt any feeling of nausea or diseom-
lort. :"v-'
'1 was Eurprised.at ihe end of the
first week to note a marked improve-
ment in my appetite and general health
and before the two packages were gor.e
1 was certain that Stuart's Dyspei>sia
Tablets was going: to cure completely
and they did not disappoint me. I can
cat and sleep and enjoy my coffee and
cigar and no one would suppose I had
ever known the horrors of dyspepsia.
"Out of friendly curiosity I wrote to
the proprietors of the remedy asking
for information as to whait the tablets
contained and they replied that the
principal ingredients were aseptic pep-
Bin (covernment test), malt, diastase
and other natural digestives, which di-
gest food "regardless of the co-ndition of
the stomach."
The root of the matter is this, the
digestive elements contained in Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets will digest the food,
give the overworked stomach a chance
to recuperate and the nerves and whole
system receive the nourishment which
can only cu-me from food; stimulants
and r.erve tonics never give real
strength; they give a fictitious strength
invariably folio-wed by reaction. Every
drop of blood, every nerve and tissue is
manufactured from our daily food and
if you can insure its prompt action and
complete digestion by the regular use
of so good and wholesome a remedy as
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, you will
have no need of nerve tonics and sani-
tariums.
Although Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
have bt^en in the market only a few-
years, yet probably every druggist in
the I'nited States, Canada and Great
Britain now sells them and considers
them the most popular and successful
of any preparation . for stomach
trouble.

Dr. George Franklin Shiels, who is I

"Colonel Heuer has no favors to ask
of the people of the two districts, and
while Mr. Bell is telling of all he ac
complished in Congress as a matter of
fact during tho period since Colonel
Heuer has been a representative of
the Engineer Department of the Gov
ernment on this coast there has been
no man in the "State of California who
has worked more faithfully, persist
ently and successfully for the inter
ests of all than has he. In one day he
has done more for California than Mr.
Bell could do in a lifetime. He is not
involved politically, personally or so
cially, but Is simply performing a ser
vice with which he is entirely familiar.
"Between those two men then the
Issue is made. Which one are you to
believe?"
" 'I tell you and you may accept it as
true, that it was through my applica
tion to the War Department that I ob
tained this money for the improvement
of the upper river. All I know is I got
the money. Now, let them use it for
the best advantage of this river.'
"I have one brief reply to make to
this and It comes from the lips of
Colonel Huer: 'Mr. Bell's statement
that the Sacramento River allotment
of $22,00 was secured by him is not
the case. ThÂ«? allotment was made by
the Secretary of War from a three mil
lion dollar appropriation placed at the
disposal of tbe Secretary and allotted
upon indorsement of General Macken
zie, Chief of Engineers, upon my rec
ommendation.'
"We now come to another amazing
and most astounding claim of the gen
tleman who is seeking your support.
This is in connection with the appro
priation of $22,000 for the work on
the Sacramento River. Listen to what
he says in connection with that:
"As to the issue created by the state
ments of Mr. Bell and contradicted by
Senator Perkins, the people of this dis
trict have the open records before
them, records documentary, but, best
of all, the record of California's senior
Senator, which for more than a quarter
of a century has been open to the peo
ple of the State of California, under
stood by the people of the State of Cali
fornia and approved by the people of
the State of California because it has
been an honorable, effectual and ex
ceptional one.
"Mr. Bell holds for himself the exclu
sive credit of having secured for Cali
fornia the construction of a Govern
ment collier at Mare Island, and his
reason for so doing was to strengthen
his cause, to bolster up his candidacy
and to give a justification to you for
supporting him.
"As a matter of fact, in the words of
Senator Perkins himself, when it comes
to the construction of the collier on the
Pacific Coast, Mr. Bell had absolutely
nothing to do with the matter.
COLUSA, Nov. 6.â The campaign was
brought to a close here to-night with
a grand Republican rally in which bon
fires blazed, two brass bands furnished
music and hundreds of rockets and
roman candles were sent skyward. A
special excursion train was run from
Sites. The speakers of the evening
were Hon. Judson C. Brusie of San
Francisco and Ernest Weyand, Repub
lican nominee for the Assembly in the
Twelfth District. Mr. Brusie spoke in
part as follows:
WELL-KNOWN REPUBLICAN ORA

Congressman Needham was followed
by Senator John F. Davis of Jackson,
who made one of the most eloquent
speeches ever heard in this city.
Congressman Needham will address
his own townspeople at Modesto Mon
day night, when he will be given a
royal welcome home after nearly eight
weeks of campaigning.
Only sixteen hundred persons who
could be seated heard Congressman
Needham in the Barton Opera-house,
but had the theater been three times
as large every seat would have been
taken. When Needham appeared the
cheering did not subside for almost
ten minutes. The Congressman made
a powerful speech, appealing to the In
telligence, sound judgment and patriot
ism of the audience and the ovation
given him at the conclusion was even
greater than that at the opening of the
meeting.
FRESNO, Nov. 5. â Congressman
James Carson Needham, whose cam
paign during the past two weeks has
been a veritable triumphal tour, prac
tically ended his /speechmaking here
to-night, and the city was absolutely
Needham mad. During the early even
ing many special trains pulled into the
'city, bringing delegates from Laton,
Conejo, Oleander, Reedley, Sanger,
Kingsburg, Selma, Fowler, Clovis, Mer
ced and Madera, the latter the home
town of Judge Conley. More than a
thousand men participated in a great
torchlight parade through the principal
streets, every man wearing a golden
silk badge with the words "Roosevelt-
Fairbanks and Needham."

McKinlay addressed a very attentive
audience on the street at Biggs this
afternoon. His visit to the lower por
tion of Butte County has had good re
sults and will add much to his ma
jority.
"The campaign has been conducted
with a much smaller fund than any
previous Presidential campaign for the
past twelve years. The fund this year,
although made up of contributions of
more than 4000 persons, has been
about one-half as large as the Re
publican fund when President McKin
ley was elected in 1896 and about one
half as large as the Democratic fund
when President Cleveland was elected
In 1S92. Every part of this fund has
come from voluntary contributions,
made without demand, importunity or
pressure, and without any agreement,
pledge, promise, assurance or under
standing, expressed or implied, regard
ing the policy or the action of the ad
ministration, or looking to any benefit
or advantage to any contributor ex
cept the benefit which will come to all
business and to all our people from
the continuance of Republican poli
cies and Republican ascendancy.
"To the great body of public-spirited
citizens who from their means and by
their personal efforts have aided in the
arduous labors of the campaign, I re
turn the heartfelt thanks of the com
mittee of 1904."
"To all supporters of Roosevelt and
Fairbanks: The Presidential cam
paign has reached its final stage and
the reports to the' Republican National
Committee from all parts of the coun
try seem to be as complete as it Is pos
sible for ante-election reports to be.
Upon these and the information that
the committee has been able to obtain
I am satisfied that the Republican can

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL.
Few People Know How Useful It Is In
Preserving Health and Beauty.
Xearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
few realize its value when taken into
the human system for the same cleans-
ing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; it is not a
druq: at all, but simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines and carries
them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking:, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion*; it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural and
eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money
is in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they
are composed of the finest powdered
willow charcoal and other harmless'
antiseptics in tablet form or rather in
the form of large, pleasant tasting
lozenges, the charcoal being mixed
with honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much improved condi-
tion of the general health, better com-
plexion, sweeter breath and purer
blood, and the beauty of It is that no
possible harm can result from their
continued use, but on the contrary,
great benefit.
A Buffalo physician, in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I ad-
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients suffering from gas in stomach
and bowels, and to clear the ; com-
plexion and purify the breath, mouth
and throat; I also believe the liver is
greatly benefited by the daily use of
them: they cost but twenty-five cents
a box at drug stores, and, although
In some sense a patent preparation, yet
I believe I get more and better, char-
coal in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges
than in an-, of the ordinary charcoal
tableU."

WIRELESS
TELEGRAMS
Marconi Makes Important
Announcement.
NEW TRANS-ATLANTIC STATION TO
BE THROWN OPEN TO THE PUBLIC
FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS JAN-
UARY 1st.
Several Large Sailing Ves-
sels Now Equipped.
Of all Inventions ever made, wireless
telegraphy is unquestionably the most
wonderful and is called upon to render
the greatest service to mankind.
But few, even among: the best posted,
have even a faint idea of what already
has been accomplished. The Marconi
eystem of wireless telegraphy is now
used every day all over the world. It
has already been tho moans of savins
bui.dreo's of lives and millions of dol-
lars of valuable property.
The Marconi system has numerous
stations in operation in the United
States. Canada. England, Germany,
Italy, Belgium, Holland, France, Spain,
India. China. Russia, Chile. Africa.
South America, Congo and a great many
other places. The Marconi system is
used every day on all the steamers of
the Cunard Line, the lied Star Line, the
Krenoh Line, the Belgian Line, the At-
lantic Transport Line, the IJeaver Line,
the Cunard Line, the Red Star Line, the
Haml'urp-American Line, the Holiand-
Aineriean Line and many others.
It hat? been officially adopted and sub-
Bidiztd with hundreds of thoasands of
dollars aiid is prominently in u?e on all
the principal men-of-war of the leading
Governments of the world. By the
Marconi system wireless telegrams are
fleshed through the air to and from
eteamers thousands of miles away. In-
credible p.s this may seem, nevertheless
it is a fact.
W'i arc living in a remarkably pro-
Cressire age. Any one who has been to
the World's Fair in St. Louis has seen
with his own eyr-s and doubts no longeÂ»>
the wonderful and practical electrical
inventions which are to-day replacing
the slow-going methods of yesterday.
The New York Central Railroad is ex-
pending J40.000.000 in electric locomo-
tives to replace the steam locomotives
on its lines. By this method San Fran-
cisco and New York will within a short
time be only two and a haJf days apart.
Professor Goldsborough, Chief of the De-
partment of Electricity at the World's
Flair, in his report on the latest inven-
tions stated that wireless telegraphy is
the most interesting If not the niost im-
portant invention of the decade, and is
to-day thoroughly and successfully es-
tablished commercially. "It is used far
more than people realize in communica-
tions between stations on land and upon
sea." Newspapers are now published
every day in mid-ocean from news Hash-
ed by Marconi wireless telegraphy to the
trans-Atlantic steamers.
I^lectrical Inventions offer the greatest
opportunities ol our age to those who
have the foresight and tJie courage to
Invest their savings In these latest time,
money and labor saving inventions.
L;rpe fortunes have been made by those
who invested in Edison Electric Light
and in Bell Telephone. The shares of
the Kdison Company increased from $100
to J4000 in one year. The profits of an
ori?i:i:il investment of $100 in Bell Tele-
phone are to-day more than $200,000.
Marconi securities, takeji now, offer as
great an opportunity.
The co.st of installation, of mainten-
ance and of operation of the Marconi
system is so small compared with that
of thf* cable and wire systems that it
can afford to transmit messages for less
tlian half the price of the old systems.
Therefore it stands to reason that the
public always gives the preference to the
cheaper rate. <
Marconi securities have increased 100
per cent during the past twelve months,
a greater increase in value than any
other security in the same time.
Our sale of Marconi securities has
been so successful that within a very
ebort time the stock will be all nold out.
TI:'- Marconi Company is earning money
every day. Its "ship-and-shore" busi-
ness wi!l soon amount to several liundrea
thousand dollars a year. Its trans-At-
lantic stations alone will earn enough to
pay annual dividends of at least 150 per
cent.
As a consequence of increased assets
nnd revenues resulting from the recent
opening fÂ«f several new and important
stations, we advise you now that the
price of Marconi certificates will be fur-
ther advanced any day from $6 to $7
without further warning-.
If you have read tbe newspapers this
past creek you must have seen that Mr.
Marconi, who arrived recently in the Unit-
ed States, announced to the world that
the new trans-Atlantic station will be
thrown open to the public for/ commer-
cial business on January 1. Immediately
following; this most important event in
the history of the world, there is no
doubt WyaX Marconi securities will be
worth from two to three times or more

were affected by realizing and the

covering of shorts, but prices eased
off again in sympathy with the late
decline of a point of United States
Steel preferred. The decline of 1%

WASHINGTON. Nov. 5. â The

will reject all the bids that ware re
ceived last Saturday for the corrVple
tion of the big drydock at thf* Mare
Island Navy Yard. The bids are con
sidered excessive and .if the contract

j the cost of the dock would far exceed
i the original estimate and the amount

L.OS ANGELES, Nov. 5.â The most
serious accident in the history of the
Pacific Electric Raihvay Company's
Interurban system occurred about 7
o'clock this morning at Willow Brook,
a station on the Long Beach line, ten
miles south of Los Angeles. Forty-eight
persons, according to the company's
official list, were injured. Of these
fifteen were passengers, two were car
men, one was foreman in charge of a
work crew and thirty were Mexican
laborers employed on construction
work by the railroad. No one was
killed and physicians in attendance
upon the injured to-night believe all
will recover. The majority of tho.-Â»e
hurt suffered from cuts, bruises, con
tusions and a severe shaking up.
though several sustained fractures and
sprains.
"George P. Adams Esq., Registrar
of Voters. City. Hall, City â Dear Sir:
We beg leave to acknowledge your
favor of November 2, with regard to
the action of the Department of Elec
tions regarding the names of persons
submitted as being illegally on the
Great Register of this city and county.
"We are pleased to know that the
work done by us is appreciated by
the Election Commissioners, but note
with considerable surprise your state
ment that our lists were not carefully
prepared and were, as a matter of
fact, erroneous in a majority of cases.
"Out of a list of about three hun
dred and fifty names in all submitted
by us to date, not including Chinese,
you have so far only claimed that we
were mistaken in thirty-seven. Un
der the present showing, therfefore, it
would not appear to be a fact that we
were in error in anything like a ma
jority of cases submitted by us to you.
It would be remarkable, indeed, if, in
preparing lists of this sort with the
limited time at our disposal, they
should be absolutely free from error.
The sources, however, from which we
have derived our information are
sources in which we have the utmost
confidence, and every list of names,
before being submitted to the Elec
tion Commissioners, has been very
carefully checked and verified.
"Referring, particularly to the names
of those persons as to whom you claim
we were in error and who are claimed
by you to be properly upon the Great
Register we have no desire to deprive
any of these gentlemen of their re
spective rights to vote at the coming
election if they are properly enrolled
on the Great Register. And if these
persons have, as requested by us, been
cited to appear before the Election
Commissioners and have then and
there, under oath, proved to the satis
faction of the Commissioners that
their names were properly on the
Great Register we are entirely satis
fied with the result.
"Referring to the list of Chinese
submitted by us to you, will you kind
ly inform us whether, in investigating
the legality of the registration of these
Chinese, you have ascertained wheth
er those under 31 years of age who
appear on the register were interro
gated and out upon their oath
as to their' ability to read
the: '.constitution in ; the Eng
lish language â¢ - and write .their â¢ own
names.' As vou will recall from our
former communication' upon this sub
ject^that .was the, point of our' criti
cism against the registration of Chi
nese and our criticism about this Chi
nese registration was not directed to
a question of residence.
"We hand you herewith an addi
tional list, containing names of par
ties registered from various locations
in the city, who, our information
causes us to believe, do not reside at
those places at the present time. We
would respectfully request in this, as
in previous cases, that these parties
be Immediately cited to appear and
show cause why their names should
not be stricken from the Great Regis
ter. Respectfully yours,
"MERCHANTS* ASSOCIATION.
"L. M. KING. Secretary."
The Merchants* Association yester
day transmitted to the Registrar of
Voters an additional list of 202 names
of persons who are reported to be il
legally registered. The association

NAPA, Nov. 5. â The Republican
campaign in Napa closed to-night with
a great demonstration, street parade
and overflow meeting. The opera
house was crowded to its utmost ca
pacity to hear and cheer Governor
Pardee and the magnetic Thomas B.
Dozier of Shasta. Percy S. King,
ncminee for the Assembly, presided.
Governor Pardee made an Instructive
and convincing- address. Mention of
the name of Duncan E. McKinlay
aroused the audience to a great degree
of enthusiasm. Pardee paid special
tribute to the ability and matchless
energy of the Republican nominee for
Congress.
Thomas B. Dozier followed in a
masterly speech, in which he exposed
the silly claims of Congressman Bell.
Tremendous applause greeted the ut
terances of the orator.

Mr. Dozier followed with a splendid,
manly speech, in which he set forth In
detail the attitude of the Democrats as
to the retention of the Philippine Is
lands and the necessity of supporting
President Roosevelt by the election of a
Republican Congressman. The speaker
also sustained the President in relation
to pension order No. 78 and closed with

ovation ever accorded a visitor or pub
lic speaker at the Veterans* Home was
given Governor George C. Fardee here
to-day. The Governor, accompanied by
his wife and T. B. Dozier, arrived at
the home on the 10:30 train and spent
the morning inspecting the institution.
On the arrival of the Governor in the
home,, grounds the men were formed in
line 'and saluted the chief executive.
At 1 o'clock Assembly Hall was crowd^i
ed with enthusiastic veterans eager to
greet the Governor. ;.
Captain Albert Brown acted as chair
man and introduced the speakers. It
was some minutes before the Governor
could speak, owing to the enthusiasm
of the men. Governor Pardee paid a
glowing tribute to the statesmanship,
manliness and worth of President
Roosevelt and spoke at length of the
principles at stake In this campaign.
During his discourse he remarked that
he could not find it in his heart to
apologize to anybody for exercising his
right as an American citizen to free
and Independent speech, and referred
to the fact that the Governor of Ore
gon had come to California to speak
for the Democratic party and Republi
cans had not objected, and said that
he was on the rostrum to-day in spite
of the protests of Democratic friends.
"It makes a whole lot of difference
whose bull is being gored." said the
Governor.

,The Mayor made brief reference to
the strike of three years ago, at the
conclusion of which he was elected to
preside over the affairs of the city
and pointed to his record as evidence
of the fact that the workingmen
could choose from their . ranks suit
able men. "While we have as yet no
national ticket," he said, "we have a
solid party organization and it is the
duty of every laboring man who val
ues his freedom to stand by it."
VETERAN'S HEAR PARDEE.
With unabated patience the Repub
licans of the Thirty-third, Thirty
fourth and Thirty-sixth districts
waited for the coming of E. A. Hayes,
candidate for Congressman In the
Fifth District, at Rolando's Hall. The
hands of the clock pointed to 11 be
fore the standard bearer arrived. His
coming was the .signal for enthusias
tic cheering that lasted several min
utes. In a direct and manly manner
the candidate outlined his attitude on
the labor question, and said:
"I know what it is to labor myself.
I was brought up on a farm, where
we worked not eight or ten hours a
day, but sixteen. My father died and
left my brother and I with a mortgage
on the farm at a time when We "were
trying to work our way through col
lege. We went back to the farm.and
worked, and yet we managed to grad
uate. The last harvest time we had
we worked till 11 at night.
"My heart is in the same place as it
was twenty-five years ago.
"When I bought two papers at San
Jose I immediately raised the wages
and reduced the hours of 'my em
ployes. That was done before I was
a candidate for Congress. If you send
me to Washington my conduct will be

OIL MAGNATE'S
SON ACQUITTED
The Republicans of the Thirty-ninth
Assembly District had a rousing meet
ing at Richmond Hall last night. E. A.
Hayes, candidate for Congress from
the Fifth District, was the principal
speaker. He opened by saying that he
in no way sought the nomination. The
convention had forced it upon him, but
now that he was in the field he wanted
to be elected. He said there were no
strings on him and that he had made
no pledges of any sort or kind.
"There is but one clear cut issue in
this fight," Mr. Hayes continued, "and
that is the continuation of the policy
of protection as represented by the
Republican party, which has been in
power for the last forty-four years,
with brief exceptions. Forty-four years
ago this month Abraham Lincoln
(great cheering) was elected President,
and then began the noble record of the
Republican party. Every progressive
policy that has since been made has
emanated from this party.
"There were then 31,000,000 . people in
this country, and now there are 82,000,
000. This country Is now the richest,
most prosperous and most powerful
country that the world has ever known.
During this period the country had
but one setback and that was during
the regime of the Democrats under the
guidance of Grover Cleveland. You all
know what a terrible financial crash
came while he was in office in 1893.
Now, if you want our progress to con
tinue, vote for the party that has
served you so long and so faithfully."
John . McGlynn was chairman. Stir
ring speeches were also made by Major
Kyle and Frank McGowan. The Stan
ford Quartet sang a number of selec
tions.

What Sulphur Does
For the Human Body In Health and
. Disease.
The mention of sulphur will recall to :
many of us the early days when our j
mothers and grandmothers gave us our
daily dose of sulphur and molasses '
every spring and fall. j
It was the universal spring and fall j
"blood purifier," tonic and curerall, !
and, mind you, this old-faBhloned rem- !
edy was not without merit. J
The idea was good, but the remedy!
was crude and unpalatable, and a large '
quantity had to be taken to get any j
effect. !
Nowadays we get all the beneficial j
effects of sulphur in a palatable, con-
centrated form, so that a- single grain
Is far more effective than a tablespoon-
ful of the crude sulphur.
In recent years, research and experi-
ment have proven that the best sulphur
for medicinal use is that obtained from !
Calcium (Calcium Sulphide) and sold '
in drug stores under the name of j
Stuart's Calcium "^Vafers. They are j
small chocolate coated pellets and con-
tain the active medicinal principle of
sulphur in a highly concentrated, ef-
fective form.
Few people are aware of the value of
this form of sulphur in restoring and |
maintaining bodily vigor and health:
sulphur acts directly on the liver, and
excretory organs and purifies and en-
riches the blood by the prompt elimina-
tion of waste material. V,
Our grandmothers knew this when
they dosed us with sulphur and molas- Â»
ses every spring and fall, but the cru- ,
dity and impurity of ordinary flowers!
of sulphur were often worse than the
disease, and cannot compare with the [
modern concentrated preparations of j
sulphur, .of which Stuart's Calcium I
Wafers is undoubtedly the best and
most widely used. if.
They are the natural antidote for
liver and kidney troubles and cure con- j
stipation and purify the blood In a way [
that often surprises patient and physi-
cian alike.
Dr. R. M. Wilkins while experiment-
ing with sulphur remedies soon found ;
that the sulphur from Calcium was.su- |
perlor to any other form. He says: j
"For liver, kidney, and blood- troubles, !
especially when resulting from const!- 'Â¦
pation or malaria, I have been sur- 1
prised at the results obtained from 1
Stuart's Calcium Wafers. In patients
suffering from, boils and pimples and |
even deep-seated carbuncles, I have re-
peatedly seen them dry up and disap-
pear in four or five days, leaving the
skin clear, and smooth, j Although
Stuart's Calcium Wafers â¢ is a proprie-
tary article, and sold by druggists, and
for that reason tabooed by many phygU
ciana, yet I r know of nothing , so safe
and reliable for constipation, liver and
kidney troubles and especially In all
forms of skin disease as this remedy."
At any rate people who are tired of
pills, cathartics and so-called blood
"purifiers." will find in Stuart's Cal-
cium Wafers a far safer, more palat-
able and effective preparation. ,

This is quite a good, picture of Miss
Kate Erhardt. who lives at 518 Fig ave-
nue. Santa Barbara. Cal. Miss Erhardt
had suffered for years with di stressing
asthma. It is needless to describe
asthma to the unfortunates who suffer
from this awful disease. All sufferers
from asthma realize what it means to
smother and cough and fight for breath
as the majority of these sufferers have
to do when a bad paroxysm of asthma
Comes on. Miss Erhardt suffered from
the worst form of asthma for years,
was taking all kinds of medical treat-
ment, which did her no pood. She came
to the EJoctro-Chemic Institute. 118
Grant avenue. San Francisco, and took
Just six week* 1 treatment. In that time
she wm thoroughly cured of her asthma
and has now returned to her home in
Santa Barbara thoroughly and perma-
nently cured. Such cures as this is con-
stantly adding additional proof that the
Electro-Cru'mic treatment does cure
diseases which in the past have been in-
c;irabl<? under the ordinary medical
treatment use<l for them. Any one is at
liberty to write Miss Erhardt and she
will be only too glad to substantiate thin
statement in every particular. Such
cures as this explain why the Electro-
Chemic practice Is now the largest spe-
cial practice on rhe Pacific Coast. It ex-
plains why other physicians with a few
electrical Instruments are trying to imi-
tate Electro-Chemistry: Such cures
should make It plain to all sufferers if
they desire an absolutely reliable treat-
ment th< y should try to go to the orig-
inal institution, the ElÂ»Â»ctro-Chemic In-
stitute, which is meeting with such un-
qualified success. The spwtelists of the
Electro-Chemic Institute invite all suf-
ferers to call for free consultation, ex-
amination and advice. The afflicted
should remember that the Electro-
Chemic practice is the most successful
treatment known for the cure of Ca-
tarrh. Consumption, Asthma. Bronchitis
Deafness, Ringing Ears. Rheumatism
Paralysis. 'Locomotor Ataxia. Neuralgia'
Cancers. Tumors. Old Sores. Eczema

Bladder troubles, Rright's Disease
Piles. FiPtula. ConÂ»tlpation. Headaches
Dizziness. Insomnia, Epilepsy, Stricture!
Prostatltis. Female Irregularities, Mis-
placements, Ovaritis, Pain in Back
etc. The Electro-Chemic Institute is
centrally located at 118 Grant ave-
nue, corner of Post street, San Fran-
cisco. There are private apartments
set aside for ladles and gentlemen, and
the office hours are daily from 9 In the
morning until 5 in the afternoon, and 7
to 8 Rt night, and Bundays from 10 in
the morning until 1 in the afternoon
The Elcctro-Chemlo treatment is abso-
lutely painless. Small children and
even Babies are now taking it without
the least complaint. It Is the most won-
derful treatment known for shattered
nerves, and in those bad cases where
the physical strength Is all gone the pa-
tient Is built up and made stronger and
thoroughly cured so quickly that it is
almost Impossible to realize the change
In the sufferer. All are welcome, but no
Incurable cases are accepted.

ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 5.âLieu
tenant General Sakharoff, reporting
under to-day's date, says that no fight
ing occurred last night. There was
some skirmishing, however, on Novem
ber 3 and 4. On the latter date the
Japanese opened a heavy artillery fire
on the village of Shanlanza. The Rus
sian losses were insignificant. Rus
sian mortars on November 4,bombard
ed the village of Oudtilatza, about
two-thirds of a mile south of Shakhe.
The Japanese lost many men. General
Sakharoff. says that the Russians are
cannonading heavily ' the village of
Sinchingpu, while the Japanese are
bombarding! Khanshan and Kaolitun.
MUKDEN, Nov. 5.â The Russian and
Japanese armies are now so .'close to
gether that maneuvering is almc-st im
possible. The Japanese are confining
themselves to occasional night attacks,
during which they shell the villages
occupied by the Russians. ' In these
attacks they wounded several Russian
officers.
â¢.. In return, parties of Russians have
penetrated the Japanese villages at
night, causing temporary panics. , On
one occasion' the Russians succeeded in
throwing two bombs into the Japanese
officers' quarters.
It had been reported > here that "the
Japanese would determinedly attack
Port Arthur on November 3, 'the Jap
anese Emperor's birthday," and it is
believed that Field Marshal Oyama is
awaiting news of the result of this
attack before advancing against Gen
eral Kuropatkln. The Japanese al
ready have received large reinforce
ments.
After a week of almost spring-like
weather, the thermometer fell 20 de
grees last night and the. first snowfall
of the season occurred to-day.

output Is a handsome one, reaching. the
splendid, total of 340,000 sacks. This is
more than the mo&t sanguine farmer

over 500,000 sacks, but. the prices
obtained this year are so much

LONDON, Nov. 5. â Hon. Richard
Strutt, son of Lord Rayleigh, has
made a radium clock which will go
for 2000 years without winding up.
In this clock small pieces of gold
leaf are electrified by means of a very
small quantity of radium salt. It
bends from the metal substance and
keeps on moving under this influence
until it touches the side of a vessel.
At the moment of contact It loses its
electricity, upon which it springs back
and Is electrified again. The repeti
tion of this over and over again is the
whole secret and Sir William Ram
say considers it might be expected to
go on, barring accidents, for a couple
of thousand years.

Two great explosions, apparently of
magazines, were heard on November 2
near Yuahpaofang.
On the night of November 3 the Japa
nese occupied a fort, since called Ichi

bravely captured by that general. Three
field guns, two machine guns, three
torpedoes and many /other, trophies
were captured. The Russians left forty
dead. ' ' .
A vigorous bombardment with naval
guns was delivered at noon on Novem

TOKIO, Nov. 5.â It is reported that
the Japanese have occupied Wantai
Hill, sunk several transports and set
fire to a battleship at Port Arthur.
Wantai Hill is one of the extensive
semicircle of 'forts defending Port Ar
thur. It is situated in about the center
of the semicircle, between the Antz
Mountain forts and the Sunchow forts,
which are situated on an adjoining hill.
The capture of Wantai Hill, it has been
pointed out in dispatches from Port
Arthur, means the dividing of the east
ern fortified ridge. The Japanese had
previously and unsuccessfully attacked
Wantai Hilr, particularly during the
latter part of August.
Delayed advices forwarded from Port
Arthur between November 2 and No
vember 4 say that two steamships of
about 3500 tons each anchored in the
west harbor were sunk by the Japanese
heavy guns, on November 1, and that
the following day another steamship of
3000 tons was sunk.

PEORIA, 111., Nov. 6. â A sensation
was created this morning when It was
announced that the basing price of
whisky had dropped from Jl 24 to
$1 23, a drop by successive stages of
5 cents In about two months. The
continued dropping of the market has
created a sensation in the ranks of the
independents, who are convinced that
the trust has begun a war of exter
mination. The usual basing price is
around 51 SO. When, therefore. It
drops so low as the present figure it
usually presages a bitter war. Whisky
men are reticent as to details, giving
the reason as strong competition.
.For some time past the war for
business between the trust houses in
this city and the three independents,
Woolner & Co., Corning & Co. and
Clark Bros. & Co., has' been particu
larly active. The fight has been car
ried on between the independents as
individuals and collectively against
the trusts. Well informed whisky men
are of the opinion that the war has
just begun and that the price may go
still lower. All the local houses are
running at full capacity, grinding
nearly 100,000 bushels of corn per
day.
When the announcement of the re
duction was made on 'change, scenes
of wild excitement ensued. There was
a hurried conference of the independ
ents and an effort was made to forbid
the publication of the figures. It was
declared that the cut was not bona
fide. Finally the quotations were tak
en off the board and no official quota
tions appeared to-day.
Samuel Woolner of Woolner & Co.
denied the quotation was a bluff on
the part of the trust.
The trust decided two months a??o
to engage in a war of extermination
and gradually worked the price down
to the figures announced by Frederick
Kingsiner, the trust manager of Pe
oria, this morning. Samuel Woolner,
the man generally credited with being
responsible for the first break in the
price, was frantic when the figures
were announced. He asked Kingsiner
to recall the price, but the latter re
fused.
No whisky was offered publfcly at
the price announced to-day.
JAPANESE GAINS
AT PORT ARTHUR
Emperor Nicholas during an audi
ence with British Embassador Har
dinge last Sunday, declared in the most
positive terms that there were Japan
ese torpedo boats in the North Sea, Ap
parently Denmark was impressed by
the same belief. The Russian Em
press Dowager, who was then in Co
penhagen, naturally did not fail to
communicate to her father the com
munication received by her from St.
Petersburg. This would account for
the extraordinary precautions adopted
by the Danish Government in detailing
warships to escort the Baltic Sea fleet
through Danish waters.
Another remarkable story is current
in well informed circles to the effect
that two balloons were seen hovering
over the Skagerack while the Russian
fleet entered the North Sea. These
were said to have been manned by
Japanese with the object of watching
the Russians, and, possibly, of drop
ping explosives.
No hint of suspicion is expressed in
any responsible quarter that the Brit
ish Government was in any way re
sponsible for the alleged machinations
of the Japanese agents.
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 6.â A sen
sational report is current here, attrib
uted to a high authority, that Russia
will undertake before the International
commission to prove that the Japanese
Minister at The Hague actually organ
ized an attack on the Russian squad
ron and will produce an intercepted
message sent by the Minister, contain
ing complete evidence that such
was the case. There is said to
be good gound for believing the
report to be true. There are
many indications that the Russian
Government has been long in posses
sion of strong evidence of a Japanese
plan to Intercept all of Admiral Rojest
vensky's warships. This explains the
willingness of Russia to submit the
case to an International arbitration.

PER3IAXEXCE OF CUKE.
The Chief aicrit.
Many BO-called pile remedies will af-
ford the user Blight temporary relief,
and the majority of sufferers do not ex-
pect more than this. Women especial-
ly, after having tried every preparation
recommended for the cure of Piles,
have come to the conclusion that there
is no cure except by an operation. This
Is rightfully viewed with dread, be-
cause of the shock to the delicate ner-
vous system of v.omen, and many of
those afflicted have resigned them-
selves to the situation -with never a
thought that there is any help in sight
for them.
We invite the attention of all such to
the experience of the lady whose ad-
dress is piven below.
"I feel it my duty to recommend the
Pyramid Pile Cure, for after suffering
ten years with a most distressing form
of Piles I am entirely cured, thanks to j
this remedy. Any one doubting this j
can write to Margaret Brady, 156 j
Whitman St., Cleveland. Ohio." :
Ten months later she writes "I am !
glad to say that I am still perfectly !
free from Piles and have not had the j
slightest trouble since I first used your j
remedy. I am well known in Cleveland j
and have advertised Pyramid Pile Cure
extensively here. I take pleasure In
doing so as it saved me from an opera-
tion, "which I always dreaded, and you
are assured the remedy can have no
firmer advocate than L"
Testimony like this should convince
the most skeptical that Pyramid Pile 1
Cure not only cures, but cures to stay 1
cured. It Is In the form of a supposl- ;
tory; can be applied in the privacy of j
the home directly to the parts affected 1
and does its work quickly and pain- j
lessly.
Druggists sell this famous remedy for !
fifty cents a package, and we urge all !
sufferers to buy a package now and j
give it a trial to-night. Accept no Sub- i
stitutes.
Write Pyramid Drug Co., Marshall, '
Slich., for their little book on the cause j
and cure of Piles, which is sent free for ,
the asking.

Then followed the social 1 hour and a
reception to Mrs. George Law Smith,
when the'Palo AJto K Club" entertained
the visitors royally, Â¦ providing a de
lightful luncheon.* ;At"4 carriages were
in waiting and every visitor was
whisked^ around^ the"" university town

_ A. visit. 'to. r the chapel," filled. with the
light of - the dying sun/ the - great organ
sobbing Jn .the .choir,', wasia -thoughtful
and inspiring moment not soon to be
forgotten. Taken all x in all the third
convention of the bay district clubs
was a famous success, due in great
measure to the energies of Mrs.. A.; E.
Osbourne, the district vice president,
and the clever women of the Palo Alto
Clubâ they're trumps.
Henry W. Delhom of 865^ Market
street had seen and marveled at the
work of stellar professional conjurers,
but after his experience early yesterday
morning with the Misses Nettie Mason
and Mae Adams he tactily, awarded
those ladies, -amateurs as they were,
the palm for clever prestidigitation. He
had laughed heartily at the discom
fiture of the man whose hat was ap
parently torn to . tatters by the stage
magician and he never failed to roar
with mirth at the remonstrances of the
man whose gold timepiece was being
rammed home in the blunderbuss of the
same maker of mystery. But he did
'not even smile at the sleight of hand
performed by the Misses \ Mason and
Adams at his expense. The owner of
the hat or the watch always had his
property restored in as good shape as
when the wizard received it, but Mr.
Delhom never got back the two $5 gold
pieces, for which one nickel, and one
brass telephone slug were deftly sub
stituted in his right-hand pantaloons
pocket. Perhaps that, was why -he neg
lected to smile.
While he is inclined to believe _ that
th6 trick was performed by Miss
Adams, he swore to a complaint which
charged Miss Mason also with petty
larceny, and she was the only one ar
rested, probably because she could not
sprint as fast as her companion.
It was in a saloon at Fourth and
Minna streets that Mr; Delhom met the
two ladies, and although the time was
3 o'clock a! m. he consigned himself to
dalliance. He purchased drinks for
them^ endeavored to avoid discrimina
tion in his tenders of attention, con
versing with them alternately lor with
both at once. At'no time was-. he aware
of a strange hand being in his pocket,
which made his surprise Â¦ all the
BASE METALS ARE DEFTLY SUBSTITUTED
greater when he discovered the baser
metals instead of the gold. He in
formed the ladles that the quickness
of "hand had completely deceived his
eye and requested that the golden
coins be restored to him to enable him
to pay for the last round of liquids.
To his astonishment and grief they
.laughingly besecched him to cease
"kidding." When he asseverated his
seriousness they waxed indignant and
told him that, he ought to be ashamed
of himself for suspecting them of such
a thing. Then they arranged their hats
with the aid of the backbar ' mirror,
scooped up their skirts and stalked
forth Into the night. Mr. Delhom pur
sued, but Miss Adams outstripped her
comrade and escaped. As the missing
gold was not found in Miss Mason's
possession, Mr. Delhom believes that
Miss Adams took it.
Judge Mogan continued the case till
next Wednesday, by which time Miss
Adams may also be in the toils.
James Flanagan, accused of stealing
5200 from Jerry Delberti, will be given
a hearing to-morrow before Judge Ca
baniss. Mr. Delberti says that in a spirit
of philanthropy he allowed the defend
ant to share his room ' at 229^ Sixth
street Friday night and that when he
awoke in the morning he found his
guest absent and $200 missing from the
trousers pocket in which he had placed
it before retiring.
Syen Dors, a Swedish mariner,

Now these talks â which in some
instances expanded just a trifle beyond
th% time limit â ranged from literature
to household science, taking in civics,
social economy and landmarks along
the way. And let it be proclaimed in
the market place that by 12:30 the
whole programme was at an end and
the delegates en route to luncheon â a
charmingly arranged affair, for which
the visitors were amply grateful.

PALO ALTO, Nov. 5. â There was an
awful chatter In the air when the
southbound train pulled in this morn
ingâa merry chatterâ for aboard were
fifty delegates to the third annual con
vention of the San Francisco District
cf the California Federation of Women's
Clubsâ fifty of them and a lot of chatty
alternates and friends.
And they had a lot of things to talk
about, these busy clubwomen, for the
"stunts" of twenty-nine clubs for a
whole year had to be disposed of be
fore the setting of the sun. How's that
for condensation?
The delegates were graciously met
a i the depot by the members of the
Palo Alto Club and escorted to the
flower-decked clubroom, where the see
ei enâ which proved a social and edu
cational stimulusâ was held.
The affairs of the day were begun
under the benign influence of an in
vocation, pronounced by Mrs. G. R.
Alden. Mrs. A- E. Osbourne, the dis
trict vice president, followed with a
spirited welcome to the delegates and
friends, who were further welcomed in
good Palo Alto- fashion by the Hon.
Marshal Black, whose name shall go
down in history for "conspicuous brav
ery in the field"â as he was the only
man within the sacred precincts and
he remained several minutes after his
eloquent address had been given
voice.
Then came the following programme:

Police Judge Mogan and Superior
Judge Murasky put their heads to
gether and decided it would be best
to defer the proposed nuptials of 15
year-ohi Rose Salazar and 19-year-old
John T. Allington untile some new
phases of the case can be properly con
sidered. So in accordance with that
decision the girl has been placed in
St. Catherine's Home and the hearing
of the charge against the boy con
tinued till next Wednesday.
The young couple were found in such
a compromising situation that their
marriage was deemed the only avail
able means of saving the girl from
shame and the boy from the peniten
tiary. He was willing to become a
benedict, but as he is a minor and his
parents reside in New York, the wed
,ding could not be effected until they
were communicated with. Then it was
ascertained that he had no means of
supporting a wife, as he is a dental
student and dependent upon his rela
tives for maintenance. When the two
Judges interrogated the girl with a
view of ascertaining whether her
parents would be willing and able to

came from Vallejo and stole blan.<ct3

Mogan. The woman is 20 and the man

Judge Mogan dismissed the cruelty to
animals charge against C. C. Moss, who
was specifically accused of plucking
chickens ere they were dead. The pros
ecution failed to show that the defend
ant had not used proper means to exe
cute the birds before he began to de
nude them of their feathers. V. O.
Harbaugh, an expert called for the de
fense, testified that Mr. Moss pierced
the chickens' brains, which was a more
humane way of killing them than by
slashing their jugular veins. It inci
dentally developed that Mr, Moss can

cause of his bad behavior, and to prove
that he intended to reform he submit
ted to having Clerk Barney Conlan
swear him to abstain from even sipping
intoxicating liquor for one calendar

man, however, brutally insisted on reg
istering her as Mary Mahena, the cog
nomen prescribed by her forebears, and
under that title she was accused before
Judge Cabaniss of having embezzled
two diamond earscrews, valued at $200,
from L. J. Parra of 231 Oak street. Mr.
Parra displayed a written contract by
which the defendant pledged himself to
return the ornaments to him on de
mand, and he informed the court that
she had broken that covenant. She will
tell her side of the story next Satur

coiffure is of old gold tint and her age

Uricsol,
the only cure for
Rheumatism.
If you tre suffering from rheuma-
tism there is a chance for you to be-
come absolutely cured. You may
cure yourself and do it quickly if you
will lay aside your prejudice and
skepticism.
Every San Francisco drugpist sells
Uricsol, the well-known remedy, and
we hereby authorize them to guaran-

Uricsol cures rheumatism in the only
possible way it can be cured.
Uric Acid and Ucates are the cause
o{ Rheumatism. These are deposited
in the tissues, blood vessels and joints
of the body.
These deposits must be dissolved
and eliminated from the system be-
fore a cure can be accomplished.
Uricsoi is a solvent of these and
tones up the system, stimulates the
kidneys, liver ..nd bowels and thus
drives them from the system.
Uricsol is harmless, and no injuri-

"Poker, even along the old lines of
'a gentleman's game,' "â¢ writes O. Z.
Newmeyer of Chicago, "never paid in
the nature of the play. Just as soon
as it might have paid just that soon it
would have lost its claim to gentility.
In the old gambling-house where rou
lette and faro paid their certain per
centages 'to the house' only the unin
itiated patron sought these places to
recoup his fortune. Gambling un
questionably does not pay. Even
where the question is asked as to the
profits of the bookmaker or the faro
dealer the same statement holds good.
'Easy money' is double winged. In
mast cases the man who drops a doK
lar bill but of his pocket is luckier
than the man who finds it. In the
one case the loser may pinch and
save In a dozen ways until he has
made more than good his loss;- on
the other hand, the finder, flushed by
.his good fortune, may bo tempted to
squander $5 in appreciation of his

The Coroner has set the inquest in
Hall's case for Monday evening at 7
o'clock.
An examination of Hall's body
shows that death must have been in
stantaneous. The deadly current en
tered the neck at the base of the
brain, and probably the unfortunate
painter hardly felt the shock. The
wires which caused his death were
primary feeders for incandescent
lights and carried 2000 volts.
OAKLAND, Nov. 5. â Broken
hearted over the sudden and terrible
death of their son, the parents of Hi
ram H. Hall, the young pole painter,
who was electrocuted yesterday while
at work for th*Â» Oakland Gas. Light
and Heat Company, have ordered the
body sent to Santa Cruz to be laid to
rest near the home of his childhood.
Benson W. Hall, the father of the un
fortunate painter, is a well-to-do
rancher living near Santa Cruz.
Neither he nor his wife knew of the
death of their son until the news was
broken to them by Theodore Hall, a
brother, who was working with Hiram
â¢when death came so suddenly. The
parents at first could not realize that
the boy who had left home only two
weeks before had been stricken by
death.

was surprised to learn that ltj struc

are well recognized, but Missouri is
making a great commotion, and one
would judge with Justice, noting the
grandeur of Its building, which Is one
of the several family rows expected
during the closing days of the exposi
tion.
California exhibitors are chafing
over the delay in issuing an official
list of awards. There is nearly a
month of the fair left and the exhibi
tors wish to hang banners over the
prize winning articles to let the world
know that the merits of these articles
made them worthy of prizes. The
awards were about to be officially an
nounced by the exposition officers,
without regard to the national com
mission, when that body mildly re
marked that it would like to know
what was doing, as a matter .of cour
tesy, if nothing else. It has had all
the awards in its keeping for some
time and has been very dilatory in
the matter of giving them out finally.
Most of the protests .made by Cali
fornia visitors will be heeded and sev
eral of the awards made will be raised,
adding more gold medals to Califor
nia's list. There will be no reduction,
as far as known, so all grand prizes
and gold medals awarded to California
will probably stand.

Among the special addresses to the
congress was one on Alaska by Gov
ernor Brady. It proved of great in
terest to the delegates and will result
in many of them looking more deeply
into the possibilities of the Immense
peninsula. -*
"Governor Brady is here with his
fruits and flowers and bananas," said
President Kerens facetiously, "and will
tell you all about Alaska."
The Alaskan chief executive drew
for his hearers a dream of empire that
created some smiles then, but may be
prophetic. He talked of the agricul-
POSSIBILITIES OF ALASKA.
"If this congress is to further the am
bitions of the Mississippi Valley only,"
was the cry of the Californians, "let it
be called the Mississippi Valley Con
gress, and the Pacific Coast will drop
out."
The Pacific Coast stayed in, though,
and it carried every demand agreed
upon by its delegation.
An effort was made on the floor of
the .congress by Delegate Fletcher to
have H. D. Wood, secretary of the~San
Diego Chamber of Commerce, indorsed
by the congress as a special represen
tative at Washington in the fight for
the naval station. Judge Gresham of
Texas opposed this, saying that *he
committee of five sent by the Trans-
Mississippi Congress to Washington
would see to the furthering of all the
projects indorsed by the congress and
that that body should not weaken its
influence by scattering and standing
behind sectional representatives. De
bate was cut off through an agree
ment that Wood should be a member
of the committee of five.
San Diego Is anxious to secure the
naval station. San Francisco will sup
port the southern city.
When the coast men began putting In
their resolutions favoring added coast
defenses at points along the whole line
from the north end of Washington to
the south end of California, the prose
cution of the improvement of Oakland
and San Pedro harbors, the creation of
a Secretary of Mines, the further im
provement of the San Joaquin and Sac
ramento rivers, the setting aside of a
section of virgin forest on the Eel River
as a park, the changing of the home
stead laws applicable to Alaska so 320
acres could be taken up there by each
homesteader under certain conditions,
the making of a sectional survey, of
Alaska and the establishment of a
naval station at or near San Diego, the
other delegates listened in wonder.
They were being awakened to the fact
that the Pacific Coast, with its great

on the map.
SAX DIEGO GETS PLACE^
There seemed to be an Impression on
the part of the members not from the
coast that the only thing worthy of
consideration was the Mississippi Val
ley, and a desire was shown to bring
but two projects prominently to the
front â that of deepening the Mississippi,
maintaining its free navigability from
St. Louis to Minneapolis and otherwise
improving it, and that of -improving the
harbor at Galveston. The Californians
soon saw that the delegates from east
cf the Pacific Coast wished to subor
dinate everything else to these two
propositions, that they might be placed
before the national Congress with more
prominence.
COAST IS HEARD FROM.
The congress, composed of leading
men from every part of the West, is
pledged to support these resolutions
with its committee at Washington and
to use every honorable means to have
the Congress of the United States leg
islate the suggestions contained in
them into actualities.
CALL BUREAU, PRESS BUILDING,
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 5.â The recognition
received by the Pacific Coast at the ses
sion of the Trans-Mississippi Congress
just closed was not obtained without
hard work on the part of active Cali
fornians here. The congress was forced
to recognize the greatness of the Pa
cific Coast and the imperativeness of its
needs by such men as Frank J. Symmes,
A. Sbarboro, General N. .P. Chipman,
A. G. Booth, Rufus P. Jennings, Fred
L. Koster, John G. Brady, H. D. Love
land, J. A. Filcher, W. H. Weilbye, Ed
Fletcher and others, who succeeded
after some struggle in securing the
adoption of every Pacific Coast resolu
tion offered.
BY PAUL' EDWARDS.
In the new building will be Profes
eor Charles Woodward, head of the
entomolijrical work; Warren T.Clarke,
assistant superintendent of farmers*
Institutes, and Henry S. Quayle, who
will all move from the Agricultural
building.
Scientific war against mosquitoes will
be waged by the entomological depart
ment of the university when Its new
building is erected and the desired ap
paratus and other equipment 13 pro
vided. The Regents have practically
agreed to spend $5000 for the erection of
a temporary building for this depart
ment, which will relieve the over
crowded agricultural building.
The new building will be situated be
tween the Spreckels physiological labo
ratory anfl the present agricultural
building, and will resemble the latter In
design. It will be perfectly equipped
to carry the investigation of insect
pests.

"In open convention Cronin gave his
solemn pledge that he was in the fight
to win; that he would not withdraw
from the ticket, but would steadfastly
continue as a candidate until election
day, all in accordance with the ex
pressed wishes of the delegates com
posing said convention to the effect that
Democrats should be nominated for of
fice whenever possible. Notwithstand
ing his pledge, said Cronin withdrew
from the ticket at the last moment,
when it was too late for the Democratic
County Committee to fill the vacancy.
The withdrawal of Cronin under the
circumstances has given rise to all sorts
of rumor, the most persistent of which
is to the effect that said withdrawal of
Cronin was the result of connivance
with and in the interest of said Fitz
gerald.
"This letter is written for the pur
pose of advising the Democratic voter3
of said Supervisorial district of said
Cronin's conduct in the premises, so
that Democrat's generally will know
that the county committee is not a par
ty to any understanding between Fitz
gerald and Cronin or the friends of
either, and to the end that the Demo
cratic voters at said Fifth Supervisorial
District may draw their own conclu
sions from the facts herein set forth
and cast their ballots on Nevember 8
as their consciences shall dictate."
John Mitchell, the Republican nomi
nee for re-election to the position of
Supervisor of the Fifth District, has
addressed a circular letter to his con
stituents, I in which he replies to the
anonymous literature that has, been
spread abroad attacking his political
record. Mitchell affirms that the "cir
culars are a tissue of misrepresenta
tions where they are not downright
falsehoods," and that they emanated
from one man, Stuart McMullan. Con
tinuing Mitchell asserts:
"Stuart McMullan is the son-in-law
of a candidate for Supervisor in tho
Fourth District in opposition to my
colleague, H. D. Rowe. He is the same
Stuart McMullan whose claim for $20,
000 for commissions on property he is
alleged to have pointed out for assess
ment was unanimously rejected by the
board, which claim he still- hopes to
collect. The present members of the
Board of Supervisors are a bar to the
collection of this preposterous claim.- I
invite candid examination of my of
ficial acts and am willing to abide the
judgment of my fellow citizens who
will take the trouble to ascertain, the
facts, but I protest against being
judged by the false and malicious state,
ments circulated anonymously by a
man whose grievance is that the board
kept his unclean hands out of the treas-
A. F. St. Sure, vice chairman, and I.
J. Muma, secretary of the Democratic
County Central Committee, have issued
an open letter in which they charge D.
W." Cronin, their party's nominee for
Supervisor in the Fifth District, with
breaking the pledge he made when he
was named as candidate for the place
by withdrawing from the contest at the
eleventh hour, when it was too late for
the County Central Committee to fill
the vacancy. St. Sure and Muma im
ply that Cronin's retirement was the
result of connivance with George Fitz
gerald, an independent aspirant to trfe
office. Following is' a portion of the
letter:
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
' 1016 Broadway, Nov. 5.
"Should crosses be stamped in the
circles at the head of two different par
ty tickets the ballot so marked would
be void."
"Should a candidate be the nominee
of two different parties and a cross be
stamped after his name in the circle of
both parties the ballot so marked should
be counted as one vote for that candi
date.
"Should crosses be stamped after the
names of two candidates for the same
office, where but one candidate was to
be elected, the ballot so marked could
not be counted as a vote for either of
the candidates for that office, but oth
erwise the ballot should be counted as
marked.
County Clerk Cook has also sent out
printed circulars containing instructions
to voters for their guidance in marking
their ballots and extracts from the Po
litical Code relative to voting. A circu
lar letter has been sent to each voter
notifying him that his name appeared
oji the . Great Register of Alameda
County and calling his attention to the
inclosed instructions and*card.
As . a final measure of precaution
against mistakes by voters in marking
their ballots the County Clerk has is
sued the following general instructions:
"A straight ticket may be marked in
two ways, either by stamping a cross
in the circle at the head of the party
ticket or by stamping a cross after the
name of each individual on the ticket.
"In case a voter wishes to vote for
one of the ten, Republican Presidential
Electors and one Democratic Elector he
should vote for each of the ten indi
vidual Electors by stamping a cross
after the name of each of the nine Re
publican' Electors and one Democratic
Elector. Should he stamp a cross in
the circle at the head of the Republican
ticket and then stamp a cross after the
name of one Democratic Elector, the
ballot could only - be counted for the
single Democratic Elector, as the elec
tion officers would be unable to deter
mine from the ballot so marked which
of the Republican Electors the voter
intended to scratch. It would also be
impossible to determine which Elector
he had intended to vote for with the
exception of the Democrat after whose
name the cross was stamped.
"Two crosses stamped after the same
of a nominee could not be considered as
a distinguishing mark, as the theory
and intent of the present law is that
marks of identification can only be
made with something, other than the
voting stamp. A ballot marked with
two crosses afler the name of any
nominee would not be void and would
have to be counted as a vote for that
candidate.
County Clerk John P. Cook has com
pleted the work of sending out sample
ballots to .voters registered for the
Presidential and county election, and in
addition to the ballots he has furnished
all possible information to facilitate the
work of the election boards. Each voter
has received from the County Clerk a
card on which Is printed the number
of the ward and precinct and the loca
tion of the polling place at which the
voter must cast his ballot. Voters are
requested to take these cards with them
to the polling places and to hand them
to the election officers at the time they
record their names. ./â¢/â¢

The City Trustees will be guided by
the resolution of the Board of Health,
and as the Litter body has declared
against the hauling of Oakland gar
tage Into Alameda it is probable that
the Trustees will revoke the local
wagon licenses of nearly fifty Oak
land scavengers.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 5. â Action will soon
be taken by the City Trustees to pre
vent the hauling of Oakland garbage
into this city and the dumping of the
wnste and filth along the Bay Farm
Island road. Several protests have been
filed with the Trustees against the
carting of outside garbage through the
local Jthoroughfares, and the Board of
Health, after Investigating the mat
ter, adopted the following resolution,
which has been transmitted to the City
Trustees and which will be read at the
meeting on Monday night:
"Resolved, That the carting of Oak
land garbage through the public streets
cf Alamed.i and the dumping of said
garbage within the city's limits is un
sanitary and "a menace to the public
health.
""We therefore recommend that the
carting of Oakland garbage through
our public streets and the dumping of
Oakland garbage within the city's lim
its be Immediately stopped, Inasmuch
as the children of Bay Farm Island,
going to and from school, must daily
travel through swarms and swarms of
poisonous flies that Infest the putrid
dumps along the Bay Farm Island
road, thereby endangering the chil
dren's 'health and the general health
as well."
After a trial Angelus was acquitted
and he enlisted in the naVy and went
aboard, the Iowa. The money, how
ever, that had been borrowed on the
home was soon to become due. A few
days ago the lad's term of enlistment
was up and when he drew his pay he
had saved enough to pay the debt of
$250 with interest. He says that he
will remain at home with his sisters
until the longing for a life at sea
moves him to re-enlist.
Soares said that he was shot as he
was going in at the gate. He said that
he recognized the masquerade and was
about to leave when he was hit in
the side with a bullet. The boy said
that the old man was bothering his
sister and would not desist.
Minnie Angelus -who shot him, but the
boy confessed that it was he who
did It.

Some time ago it was reported ex
clusively in The Call that Compere
had found the parasite needed. He
saw in Spain orchards with hundreds
oi apple trees in vigorous bearing. The
codlin moth existed in these orchards,
but the parasite was there, too, and so
vigorous and effective that, although
it was proved that the codlin moth had
been there for thirty years, the farm
ers were surprised to find that it ac
tually existed in their orchards. This
is taken to be a satisfactory proof of
the efficiency of the parasite.
Eggs and one or more mature para
sites are in evidence in the headquar
ters of the Horticultural Commissioner
in the ferry building in this city. They
are objects of the greatest interest to
Messrs. Ehrhorn and Cams of the quar
antine service of the State. The eggs
are beginning to hatch out. Abund
ant food^ has been provided for the
maintenance of the parasites when
they begin to feed. In a few months
colonies will be sent to Infested or
chards in all parts of the State and
then the most impqrtant experiment,
horUculturally considered, that has
ever been tried in the United States
will be made on a large scale. If Cali
fornia succeeds the other States of the
Union will eventually, no doubt, take
note of the newcomer.
The parasite that is expected to ex
terminate the codlin moth in Califor
nia and ultimately, perhaps, through
out the United States, has made itÂ«
first American appearance in San
Francisco. It came in charge of the
Horticultural Commissioner of the
Slate of California. George Compere
d.scovered the parasite In the apple
orchards of Spain. The codlin moth
that the parasite is imported to at
tack is the source of the falseftearted
ncss of apples. The codlin moth
causes an annual loss of many mil
lion dollars by inflicting upon the
farmers of . the ; land bad apples in
large percentage of the total crops.
Nothing that has yet been tried has
prevailed against the moth. Even
faithful obedience to the fruit-grow
er's commandment, "Watch and
spray," has availed little.

He will assume his duties here, on or!
about November 15 /and in the mean- |
time he will give his attention to busi- j

Bancroft is now general manager of
the Union Pacific road west of Green
River, the Oregon Short Line as far as
Huntington and of that portion of the
Southern Pacific east of Reno, so that
in assuming the rrianagement of the
Southern Pacific lines from this city to
the Oregon State line, Reno and El
Paso, ,he adds a considerable burden
to his present responsibilities.
Among railroad men throughout the
country Bancroft is regarded as a very
cajjable operating official and it would
not surprise many, notwithstanding
stories to the contrary, if he was even
tually made a permanent general
manager of the Southern Pacific. He
said yesterday that he was absolutely
v/ithout information as to who is to be
General Manager Markham's perma
nent successor. Bancroft has made
frequent trips to San Francisco during
the time he has been connected with
the Harriman lines and is familiar
with the system wh*ich is soon to be
given over to his charge. He was ac- |
companied to this city by I. 0. Rhodes,
purchasing agent of the Oregon Short
Line. ;

Conditon of Channel-Street Sewer.
The Board of Public Works yester
day filed a report with the Supervisors
that the Channel-street sewer is in
good condition except between Fif
teenth and Sixteenth streets, where it
is badly cracked, owing to the cars
of the Southern Pacific Company pass-
Ing over It at that point. At the cross
ing of Eighth, Kansas and Division
streets the electric, conduit of. the San
Francisco Gas Company projects into
the sewer, and, acting as a dam,
causes the street to become flooded.
The company promised to remove the
conduit, but has not done so.
In Justice to Collector Lynch it must
be said that up to a year ago" the de
partment at Washington rated the ac
counts of his office high for accuracy
and -regularity, but the fact that $4600
could be withheld by one employe
shows that something was wrong with
the department bookkeeping.
United States District Attorney Mar
shall B. Woodworth" returned from the
country yesterday, having been sum
moned to his office by an urgent tele
gram from Washington. The telegram
instructed him to investigate and prose
cute George A. Wright and all other
persons In the office of United States
Internal Revenue Collector Lynch
whom he might discover to have been
short in their accounts at any time, Ir
respective of the fact that the short
ages may have subsequently been made
good.
Mr. Woodworth said yesterday that
he had not had time to familiarize him
self with the case of Wright's shortage
of $4600, but would immediately look
into the papers and have a conference
with Special Revenue Agent Bert M.
Thomas. He added that several days
would probably elapse before he would
be 'ready to move in the matter, and
that if he then found that a crime had
been committed he would lose no time
in prosecuting the guilty parties.
It is believed that Wright is not the
only offender in the office. Others be
sides him wagered money on the races
and were so unfortunate as to pick
out the wrong horses. Others frequent
e dthe crystal palaces of the tenderloin.
These, however, made good before they
were dtected, but whe nthe tide receded
Wright was discovered high and dry in
the fierce white blaze of publicity.
It has been pointed out that the
greater number of John C. Lynch's ap
pointees were selected at the dictation
of leaders of the party machine in this
State, and there has been much com
ment among business men as to the
careless methods prevailing In that of
fice. A well-known business man in
formed'a Government official recently
that on one occasion he was handed a
greater value of stamps than the
money paid by him called for, and that
upon discovering the error. after he had
left the revenue office he returned and
refunded the excess. He said that the
man who gave him the stamps was un
der the Influence of liquor.
These and other matters displaying
carelessness and incompetency have
been reported to Agent Thomas, and In
consequence his investigation will be'
directed not against Wright alone, but
into the "affairs and management of
every branch of the office. . -. .".

Vulicevich used to hang around the
Police Courts when they were ,.at the
City Hall,, and. in December, 1894,- he
obtained money from a man by threat
ening to arrest him on a warrant pur
porting to have been signed by Judge
Joachimsen. He was arrested for ob
taining money by false pretenses and
was sentenced to serve three months in
the County Jail. In August, 1895, he
was convicted of vagrancy and sen
tenced to serve six months in the
County Jail. While serving that sen
tence he was allowed to leave the jail
occasionally and take a stroll down
town. This caused a scandal at the
time.

Postmaster Jensen had refunded the
$1421 held by him, and the Jury took
pity upon him and his family and con
sidered that he had been sufficiently
punished by reason of the exposure and
consequent disgrace. The petty smug
gling cases were dismissed because the
punishment was too severe for the

1904, at Punta Arena, Central America;
Frances de Souze, charged with smug
gling two dressed ostrich feathers Octo
ber 31, 1904; George Nichols, charged
with smuggling 100 cigars on September
1, 1904; D. J. Callaghan, charged with
smuggling thirty-six silk caps on July
1, 1904; Geronimo Rodriguez, charged
with having uttered a forged United
States Shipping Commissioner's certifi
cate on July 11, 1904; John Leslie,
charged with having disposed of sub
sistence stores of the United States on
August 12, 1904, to F. W. Arnold for $3.
and Joseph de Benedetti, charged with
violating section 5426 of the Revised
Statutes.
The United States Grand Jury broke
the record yesterday in the matter of
passing over charges. Out of thirteen
cases brought before it only two indict
ments were found. The eleven cases
ignored had been presented during the
absence of United States District At
torney Woodworth in the country on
official business. He was very, much
surprised yesterday 'on his return to
find that so large a number of charges
had been ignored. The eleven cases are
as follows:
When searched at the City Prison a
check for $2 50 purporting to be signed
by "E. A. Hayes" and drawn on the
San Francisco National Bank, was
found in his pocket, besides an applica
tion form for appointment as Inspector
at the coming elections in the name of
About a week ago Vulicevich passed

â¢ment agents. 610 Clay street. The check
was for $2 50, but Besson only ad
vanced him 52. It is expected that many
others will be heard from. ,
S. W. Vulicevich "was arrested by De
tective Egan on Friday night and
locked up in "the tanks" at the City
Prison pending further investigation.
He has been in trouble before, and this
time he is accused of passing a number
of fictitious checks on saloon-keepers
and others on the water front. He has
been using on the checks the names of
candidates who are seeking the suf
frages of the electors.
Vulicevich succeeded- in passing three
checks, each for $2 60, drawn on the
Anglo-Californian Bank and purporting
to be signed by Judge J. M. Troutt, on
E. O. Wilkens. saloon-keeper at Wash
ington and Davis streets. He was so
pleased with his success that he pre
sented Wilkens with another check for
$10. also purporting to be signed by
Judge Troutt.
The body of the man who ' died of
carbolic acid poisoning at the Central
Emergency Hospital last Friday
night was identified yesterday as that
of Mario Musso, a teamster residing
at 1407 Dupont street. He had been
despondent for several days.

T>r. Jacob Pollatsek, a physician of
high attainments, graduate of the Roy
al University of Budapest, former sur
geon of the Sultan of Turkey and a dis
tinguished linguist, whose name Is bet
ter known in Egypt than in San Fran

Hospital yesterday morning from the
effects of poison administered with sui
cidal intent. In his sixty-third year,
broken in health, friendless and pov

struggle which seemed to him hopeless.
He was found on Friday unconscious
In a cheap room at the "What Cheer
House which he had occupied for the
past fifteen months. From there he was
taken to the hospital, where he died.'
Among his effects was found the fol

"To the Honorable Coronerâ Dear Sir:
I feel it is the end. I beg of you as
tutor of the dead no{ to have rested my
remains in the so-called Potter's field.
Should it for any reason or another be
shown that this, my last wish, is un
feasible, please surrender my cadaver
to some medical college (of good stand-

erwise, as nobody has a right to inter

BEWARE
Of a cough, especially of infants
and delicate children. Don't wait
until the cough becomes hard, the
throat inflamed and the lungs and
bronchial passages congested.
Avoid cough remedies that contain
opiates, stupefying drugs and dan-'
gerous anodynes. They only
quiet the symptomsâdrug the
cough into silenceâbut that is not
curing. A weak place is left to
cause trouble later. A remedy
must be used to subdue the in-
flammation, stimulate the secre-
tions, soothe and heal the irri-
tated membranes and cure the
cough to stay cured.
"Adams'
Irish.Moss Cough Balsam is such
a remedy. It enjoys the indorse-
ments of many physicians, \who
use it in their daily practice. Sold

The brothers had also witnessed the
first will. Mrs. Watson was the favor
ite of Miss Dolbeer among her kin, and
the greatest surprise was manifested
on every hand except by Mr. and Mrs.
Watson themselves when the opening
of the testament: revealed that she had
been completely 'overlooked.' There had
been some small family differences be
tween Miss Dolber/and her kinfolk, but
the strongest relations of friendship
existed'with her favorite cousin. And
In the test of that bond. of friendship

Republicans Hold Rally at Tiburon.
TIBURON, Nov. \ 5>â The Repub
licans of Tiburon "'Â¦'closed their cam
paign to-night withVaViarge and en
thusiastic meeting, ys^eeches were
delivered by Senator S. H.
Olmsted, E. B. Martirielli and L. C.
Pistolesi.
Notwithstanding determined effort to
maintain secrecy, it transpires that Ber
tha M. Dolbeer's will now being con
tested In Judge Coffey'8 court was the
second testament she had executed. In
her first will it was her purpose to be
queath almost half a million dollars to
her cousin, Mrs. Douglas Sloane Wat
son. But she changed her mind, de
stroyed this will and made Etta M.
Warren, her lifelong companion and
most Intimate friend, the chief bene
ficiary of the estate, worth more than
$1,000,000.
It has always been suspected that
Miss Dolbeer had made another will,
in which there had been a different dis
position of her wealth than that set
forth in the instrument she executed in
April last, four months before her fatal
fall from a seventh-floor window of the
Waldorf-Astoria in New York. But the
persons who were aware of the fact
sealed their lips and the existence of
another will was never definitely
known.
While the-, news of a prior will is
startling, it can have no effect disad
vantageous to the will It is now sought
to probate. Douglas Sloane Watson,
husband of the relative who was de
prived of approximately 5500,000. wit
nessed the execution of the last testa
ment, wherein Miss Dolbeer ignored his
wife and transferred the bulk of her
estate to Miss Warren.
The Watsons have ample means, are
high-minded people and the action of
Douglas Sloane Watson in acting the
part of witness to the instrument in
which Miss Dolbeer displayed a radical
change of purpose -indicates that he ac
quiesced in the new disposition of the
estate. His brother, Arthur B. Watson,
was the other witness. They could
have entertained no such question - of
Miss Dolbeer's mental condition at the
time as is raised by Adolph Echander,
the uncle whose contest ' of the will ; is
now on trial.
The Watson family had no complaint
to make against the large bequest to
Miss Warren, though the most I of it
was taken from what had originally
been intended as Mrs. Watson's share.
They , deemed It right that ' Miss Dol
beer should distribute her wealth as
she saw fit. That the .Watson brothers
attested to the genuineness of the sig
nature of Miss Dolbeer's second will is
"American art amounts to a deal
more than most Americans themselves
appreciate. One object of our proposed
exhibition Â«s by eliciting the opinions
of good judges here to awaken our own
people to a recognition of the fact that
we have progressed in some respects
beyond the European schools and have
etruck out for ourselves on distinctive
ly American and original lines."
Snell and his wife, who is also a tal
ented artist, have > been spending the.
summer in Cornwall, and when they
return to New York will take with
them many studies of the picturesque
Bcenery of that region. One of Snell's
companions during his sojourn was Tol
man, head of the Providence Art
School.
"If we hold an exhibition here, and at
r repent I see no obstacle in the way of
satisfactory arrangements being effect
ed," said Snel!. "I am certain that Eng
lish critics and artists will be surprised
at what we have accomplished in add
ing to thp range of effects attainable
by a medium whose limitations have
heretofore been regarded as definitely
fixed. We shall show them pictures

Impossible to paint with water colors
alone.
LONDON. Nov. 5.â It is probable that
London will this winter be treated to
an exhibition of water colors by Ameri
can artists. Henry B. Snell, president
of the flTew York Water Color Club,
under whose auspices it is proposed
that the exhibition shall be held, is now
here making arrangements for the leas
ing of a suitable gallery for the pur
pose. Snell has popularized in America
a method of water color painting which
is almost unknown here. Its chief dis
tinctive feature consists in the employ
ment of stiff brittle brushes in place of
the soft sable kind used by English
water color artists. Specially prepared
paper is used, and the color is laid on
with little moisture. Bold arid vigor
ous effects are obtained, which are
commonly found only in oil paintings,
and are in striking contrast to the soft,
conventional treatment which charac
terizes the English school.

Mr. Redding was cordially received.
In part he said:
"Ladies and gentlemen, fellow parti

I call now for the Democrats, because
I know that after Tuesday the Demo

After that eventful day I look to find

Joseph D. Redding, lawyer and club
man, delivered a speech on behalf of
the Republican party and its candi
dates at the Alhambra Theater last
night that was out of the rut. Emerg
ing as it did from the maze of tariff
and financial theories that have been
hurled right and left for the last few
weeks it was refreshing. And the audi
ence â a large one â demonstrated its ap
preciation by frequent cheers and out
bursts of applause.
Julius Kahn, Republican candidate
for Congress in the Fourth District,
was chairman' of the evening. He was
introduced by General George Stone,
chairman of the Republican State Cen
tral Committee. Prior to introducing
Mr. Kahn, General Stone made an in
teresting prediction. "I predict," he
said, "that California will send a solid
Congressional delegation to Washing
ton, that we will have an almost unan
imous Legislature- and that we will
carry California for Roosevelt by a
plurality of 60,000." The prediction
roused great enthusiasm.
"I am here to-night to introduce to
you a man.. that has traveled 3300 miles
to get home to vote," said Julius Kahn
in introducing Mr. Redding to the audi
ence. *'That is. a pretty good kind of
a Republican and a pretty good kind
of Californlan. I'm sorry he does
not live in my district, because I know
that if he did he would vote for me
with the rest of the ticket, but I have
the satisfaction of knowing that as a
resident of the Fifth District he will
help swell the majority that will place
my colleague on the ticket, E. A.
Hayes, in office."
MAKES A PREDICTION.
Judge Melvin was heartily applauded
at the conclusion of his speech. After
three rousing cheers for the Republican
leaders .the meeting broke up.
The speaker then compared the trade,
conditions and the workingman's wel
fare during the Democratic and Repub
lican administrations. He quoted sta
tistics showing the increase in savings
bank deposits during the Republican
regime. He deprecated the Democratic
attempts to stir up sectional animosity
for political purposes and urged Re
publicans to vote solidly to keep the
Democratic leader on the farm at EaÂ«*
pus.
He ended with a glorious tribute tÂ»
the Republican candidates, California
and the nation.
TRADE CONDITION'S.
"The next speaker, ladies and gentle
men, comes from a county that can al
ways be relied on to give the nation a
good Republican vote. He Is conver
sant with the conditions over there,
and I take pleasure In introducing
Judge Henry S. Melvin of Oakland."
Judge Melvin first spoke of hla re
semblance to E. Myron Wolf, and re
gretted that the Commissioner was un
able to speak.
He said he regretted that Judge Par
ker lost his head in the^Jast few days
of the campaign and descended from
the highly personal esteem Republicans
formerly felt for him. He referred to
the President's letter and said that it
gave the nation an excellent idea of the
man. . The speaker, next attacked the
policies and promises of the Democrats
and the ambiguous statements of Judge
Parker on so-called militarism and im
perialism.
On the question of protection he'
quoted Parker's letter, in which thÂ»
Democratic candidate for President
said that he believed the tariff should
be gradually changed. Judge Melvin
showed the inconsistency of the state
ment by asking if the voters would

BUTTE. Mont., Nov. 6. â With the
close of the~ Presidential campaign in
Montana the- various parties In the

Silver Bow County,, the stronghold of

"The character of Mr. Roosevelt
may be best determined by the opin
ion of foreign diplomats and rulers
whose duty it is to study the leaders
of the nations, and nowhere in Europe
are words spoken of Roosevelt except
in commendation of his character and
genius. And a. man may also be
judged by the character of the com
pany he keeps. Look at the men
that surround President Roosevelt.
No man in the world's history has so
adroitly made himself the master of
the diplomats- of the powers as has
Mr. Hay. And in Elihu Root we have
another of the great men the Presi
dent has surrounded himself with- \ I
will say that, in my opinion, the next
fifty years will see no such timber as
that from which Mr. Roosevelt has
drawn to make up his Cabinet. His
judgment of great men determines his
own greatness."
JUDGE MELVIN* SPEAKS.
Mr. Redding next paid a splendid
tribute to President Roosevelt, whom
he has known since childhood, and
told of how he boxed with Roosevelt
once and how Roosevelt hit him a
"wallop that made him see more stars
in a second than he could see at the
Orpheum in a week." As to imperial
ism, he said he was damned If he
knew what it meant unless it meant
the acquisition of territory, which
policy the Democrats first Inaugurated
by the Luisiana purchase during the
adminstration of Jefferson. In con
clusion, Mr. Redding said:
TRIBUTE TO ROOSEVELT.

that there were stretches of green be
yond the hills that lined the coast and
that gold existed far in the interior.
But he did not believe the tale and,
unfurling his sails, turned the prows
of his ships homeward.
."About a year and a half ago an
other man was here. He, too, made a
report upon what he saw. He said he
had found two million people living In
a higher plane of prosperity than any
other similar number on the face of
the clobe. He said he had found a
new empire, a land that faced the
Western sea, and that was destined to
dominate the commerce of the globe.
This man, my friends, was Theodore
Roosevelt. Stand by this man that
knows you and knows your needs. It
is your duty to yourselves and to the
great State we are all so proud of."

The use of forty Standard voting
machines at next Tuesday's election
will not be interfered with by the suit
brought by E. T. Harvey in the inter
est of a rival device, to prevent the
Board of Election Commissioners and
other city authorities from accepting
and paying for the machines under
the contract. Judge Sloss yesterday
sustained the demurrer of the defend
ants to the complaint, giving the
plaintiff ten days in which to amend.
The order to show cause why an in
junction should not issue was dis
charged. In the brief of Reed & Nus
baumer for the plaintiff the' question
of accepting the machines was not
mentioned and it was presumed that
that part of the action was aban
doned.
According to the brief of John S.
Partridge for the defense the action
remaining was one by which a tax
payer sought to enjoin the Supervisors
from passing a demand under a con
tract for payment for goods in ad
vance of their acceptance and before
any demand had ever been presented.
It had been demonstrated, said the
brief, that such a writ would not lie.
The Supervisors had undoubted pow
er to order payment for voting ma
chines. Having this power, , it was
for them to determine whether the
machines were up to the specifications
and comply with the requirements of
the statute. Certainly, said" Partridge,
the court will not presume in advance
that the Supervisors are going to vio
late their oath of office and accept
machines not up; to the contract. If
the plaintiff's rule were adopted every
disappointed bidder would seek to en
join the board from paying for sup
plies and compel the court to take
testimony as to the character of those
supplies.
The plaintiff's attorneys argued that
the law was violated in that the ma
chines did not perform certain acts
required by the law and that as the
question went directly to the consti
tutionality of the law. the court alone
had "jurisdiction.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. 5.â
Stanford, 57; Utah Agricultural Col
lege, 0. Eight hundred college men and
women came out to-day to see the last,
preliminary game . of football. The
score would seem to indicate that they
saw a fine, fast game, but such is far
from the truth. Utah proved an un
worthy foe. Had the university men
played the kind of ball they should be
playing at this end of the season the
score would have been above the hun
dred mark. The Utah " men, though
playing.a hard, gritty game, were not
only, unable to advance the ball, but
their ltne did not hold against the furi
ous onslaught of the faster Stanford
backs. They were unable to punt and
were downed in their tracks on Stan
ford's kicks with a regularity that soon
became a steady habit. Though great,
broad-shouldered fellows, they have yet
to learn the meaning of team work, of
line bucking, of punting and of end
runs. A scrub team of preparatory
youths could have beaten them by a
larger score. This explains a
slight feeling of gloom hangs over the
campus to-night. After the Oregon
game the university men were jubilant,
but to-day's contest leaves an unpleas
ant feeling of uncertainty.
STANFORD'S PLAY IS RAGGED.
The varsity's, work was undeniably
ragged. It was hard: it was fairly
rapid; but at times, instead of there
being two teams in the field there were
twenty-two men and the scrimmage
looked like a class rush. This lack of
team work may prove the weak link in
Stanford's armor. The interference
there was little or none of it, and to
the fast ball carriers themselves must
be given almost the entire qredit for
the victory. An end run or two was
tried occasionally for sake of variety,
but straight line bucking and tackle
plays were the great gain gainers. , The
quarter-back run was tried twicej once
for loss and once for a good gain. S
The pleasant feature of the game was
the lack of fumbling among the cardi
nal players. Weller was the only of
fender. The cardinal ends played in
good shape, and Utah could not gain
around them. The Mormons' few yard9
gain were made through the Stanford
guards. Stanford made ten touch-

Before the largest attendance ever
gathered to witness an Academic Ath
letic League football game the Lick
eleven won the championship from
Oakland High School yesterday on the
Presidio grounds. The game was a
hard-fought one from start to finish.
The Lick men found their opponents
much stronger than they anticipated.
Neither side scored. in the first half,
but in the second half Lick carried the
hall over Oakland's, goal .line twice.
Moullen kicked the first goal but missed
the second. The final score was: Lick
11, Oakland 0.
It was a slow game and not an inter
esting one to witness. Lick was in
much better condition, than Oakland,
and toward the end of the game the
boys from across the bay put up a
ragged defense. In the first half Oak
land more than held its own. Coach
Cavanaugh'g' shift play, which was
worked so successfully against Palo
Alto, failed utterly yesterday. Coach
Bishop of Oakland taught his men how
to stoi> this play, and they did it eveiy
time Lick tried it. Oakland had a slight
advantage in the first hulf, but neither
side came close to scoring. Oakland
tried. a field goal from the twenty-yard
line, but the ball was passed badly.
The feature In this half was a thirty
yard run by "Chick" O'Connor, Lick's
left end.
The Lick eleven went into the sec
ond half realizing that it would require
its best efforts to score a single touch
down. The Mission boys hit their gait
soon after the commencement of the
second half, and from then until the
end of the game everything went Lick'3
way. Thev got the ball on their own
thirty-yard line, and by bucking three,
five and ten yards at a time carried tht
ball over the ltne for a touchdown. The
pace told on the Oakland boys, and
after each down time had to be taken
out for, them. Snell and Merritt hit the
right side of the Oakland line hard and
often and always for a good gnln. Snell
hurdled the line and scored the first
touchdown. Moullen kicked the - goal.
Score. 6-0. . :>7
After the first score Lick seemed sat
isfied and the game 'resolved itself into
a punting duel. Lick had a decided ad
vantage in kicking, but Oakland
handled kicks much better than their
opponents. After several- exchanges
Lick secured the hall on Oakland's
forty-yard line and again commenced
hammering the right side of Oakland's
line. Lick's backs were fierce and tore
through the fast weakening Oakland
line almost at will. Snell. Lick's f ull :
l/ack, was reckless " during the second
half and was the chief ground gainer.
Hall, who took Seminario'a place at
left lna.lt. carried the ball over the line
for the second touchdown., He went be
tween tackle and guard for three yards.
Moullen missed the goal. -Score, 11-0.
The last touchdown was made two min
utes before the game ended.

they held for downs. Friezell kicked
outside for a ten-yard gain. On the
first scrimmage Lasater bucked
through Nevada's line for a touch
down. Force missed the goal.
California kicked off forty-five
yards and Friezell punted back
to^ center. Snedigar came back
twenty-five yards before he could
he stopped. The home team car
ried the ball up the field to within
three yards of the opponents' goal and
fumbled. 1. Hart fell on the pigskin
and Friezell punted thrity-nve yards.
Lasater, Meade and Snedigar were
good for from five to eight yards apiece
on every play and the first named was
finally sent through for his second
touchdown. J>asater, incidentally, is a
much niora consistent ground gainer
than big "Jim" Weller of Stanford.
Force succeeded in kicking the second
goal. - _Â¦;
CALJFORXIA IS PENALIZED.
After The third kickoff California got
the ball right on top of the visitors'
goal and was then penalized for hold
ing. Force missed a try at a field goal
and Friezell ma.de* a free, kick back to
center. The blue and gold players
then pushed the leather through for the
third touchdown, making one fumble
on the way. Force missed the goal and
the half ended.
California started a second team in
th* last half. : The men were like ice
wagons two-thirds of the time. The
line of scrimmage wandered back and
forth and ueither goal waa in any very
great danger. Kitrelle and Friezell
each missed attempts at ileld goals. It
was in this half that the sagebrush star
skirted California's right end from his
own twenty-five ya'rd line to that of the
home team. Shortly afterward he
made a thirty-yard run on the other
end. Ke was in every scrimmage and
frequently hurdled the line oh the de
fensive to stop center plays. The game
ended with the ball in Nevada's pos
session on her own fifteen-yard line.

Stanford kicked off to Utah at the
sound of the whistle, but recovered the
ball a moment later, when the Mor
mons were forced to kick after two un
successful attempts to gaip through
the cardinal line. With the pigskin on
the Utahs' thirty-yard line Weller
charged through center for ten yards.
Chalmers followed with eight more,
and then Dole surged outside right

only two minutes of play. Smith at
once kicked the goal. After that touch
downs came fast and furious. Utah's

The blue and gold football team de- J
feated Friezell of Nevada at Berkeley
yesterday by a score of 16 to 0 in Cali- j
fornia's last practice game of the sea
son. To be sure, there were other Sage
brushers in the visiting squad, but they
did not offer much opposition to the on
slaughts of the home eleven's backs
nor carry the ball beyond the line of
scrimmage on the offensive. The tow
headed child of the desert was in a
class by himself, and his work yester
day won for him a niche in the temple
of fame to be dedicated to football he
roes. His sixty-yard run around the op
posing right end on a fake kick was the
most spectacular feature of the con
test. Ke also made many other brilliant
plays, which were not so readily dis
cernible from the bleachers.
AfThe next interesting feature of yes
terday's game was the discovery that |
the men who have been circulating the
rumor that the blue and gold squad
had gone stale have a painful disregard *
of the value and sentimental beauty of j
truth as she is generally known. Dur- 1
ing the first half the home team was j
speedier and more spirited than at any.j
time before this season. The second
eleven, which took the field after the in
termission, was slow, but none of the :
twenty-ttve men on the field showed the j
apathy which is characteristic of stale
ness.
California tried some new formations j
and plays, and most of them j
admirably. Booth did surprisngly well
at quarter and probably earned for
himself the opportunity to get into the .
championship contest. The interference
was better than heretofore this season, j
and there were sporadic cases of team
play. Coach Hopper might save his pu
pils from defeat next Saturday by find
ing some man to kick goals. Force has
thus far carefully kept concealed any j
ability he may have in that direction.
PLAYEiiS ARE IXJURED.
Booth put Smith of Nevada out of the
game. When the two men came togeth
er head-on the attendants went out to
pick ur> the remains of the little chap,
and the crowd could hardly repress its
amusement when it was learned that
the bis fellow was the injured man.
Jones of the visitors had his wrist
sprained or broken, and Hamlin, also
from across the border, had his hip put
out of joint. There was little willful
roughness in the game, but those Cali
fornia backs hit the line like a ton of
brick and something had to give way.
The- three touchdowns were all made
in the first'half. California kicked off
and when Nevada had worked the ball
back to center, one of her men fumbled.
Howard fell on the ball. The blue and
gold eleven hammered the visitors
back to their three-yard line where

The officials of. the California .Polo.
and Pony Racing Association held their
annual meeting some days- since and
made ambitious plans, which should re
sult in the marked development 'of the
higrh-class sports they foster. The most'
important step in this, direction was
taken when Robert L^ighton of Van
couver. B. C. was engaged as perma
nent secretary. Mr. Leigh ton ' is '. a
genius in this line, there being. no. more
competent racing secretary in all
America. He has been secretary of the
ICorth Pacific Fair Association, for the
last three years, but from now on he
Tvill devote his whole time and atten
tion to the association's interests, as it
is the intention to hold polo tourna
ments and race meetings at frequent
intervals, not only in ' San "Francisco,
but in various portions of the State.
Rudolph Spreckels. who is an enthu
siast on pony racing, has been elected
president. The other officials "are:
Charles W. Clark, first vice president;
Francis J. Carolan, second vice presi
dent; R. M. Tobin, treasurer. The di
rectors for the year will be Thomas A.
Driscoll. Lawrence McCreery, Charles
W. Clark, F. J. Carolan, Rudolph
Spreckels, R. M. Tobin. W. E. Pedley.
John Parrott and R. Cameron Rogers.
Messrs. Spreckels, Carolan, Clark,
Pedley and Walter Hobart will form
the racing committee, while Messrs.
Driscoll, R. M. Tobin, McCreery, Praed
and Rogers will serve in a like capacity
for the polo interests.
It had been planned to bold a polo
toumamenf and race meeting during
Thanksgiving week at Del Monte, but
as satisfactory arrangements could not
be made the venue had to be changed.
Charles "W. Clark then kindly placed
his private racecourse and polo field at
San Mateo at the association's dis
posal, which offer was gladly accepted.
Mr. Clark is having extensive improve
ments effected, and on account of its
convenient proximity to the city a large
patronage is assured. The dates will be
from the 23d to the 2Sth inst., the races
being scheduled for Thanksgiving day
and for Saturday, the 26th. A large ;
number of ponies have been in train
ing for some time past and good racing
is assured. The offices of the associa
tion are room 21, 421 Market street, and
the secretary will be pleased to afford
all information to intending members.
Mr. Spreckels has a string of ten
ponies in training. Walter S. Hobart
has five, F. J. Carolan five, Charles W.
Clark five, Lawrence McCreery three
and there are others in various stables.
The Southern California owners will,
as usual, send up strong strings.
There will be a match game of polo
to-day on the club field at Burlingame.
No admission is exacted, spectators be
ing welcome.

If winter is to be dreaded for its snows, icy, cutting winds and damp, unpleasant weather, it is more to be
dreaded because it brings with it the most annoying and disgusting of diseases â Catarrh. The changed condition
of the weather brings on "bad colds" which irritate the. inner skin and tissues, and they secrete an unhealthy
matter that is absorbed by the blood and scattered all through the system in its circulation, and at the first sign of
winter the patient begins to "hawk and spit. " All the mucrns membranes and tissues of the body are affected by
this disease, and the filthy, poisonous matter finds its way to every part of the body, making the sufferer dull and
half sick all the time. The head and eyes have blinding aches, the stomach bloats, the hearing is often affected and

MONTANA GREYHOUND PROVES SPEEDY
The Commuters are keeping abreast
with the Angels and the Tigers in the
greatest baseball pennant race Califor
nia has ever known. Lohman's fight
ing tossers fought the Siwashes t6 the
finish yesterday and beat them for the
fourth time without a break. By turn
ing this trick, Oakland is tied with
Los and Tacoma. and will
probably be the team to beat for the
flag, as the injury to Eagan will put
the Tigers out of the going.
Buchanan got into the game after an
illnes? of many days. Some of the
fans were a bit skeptical and afraid
Jimmy would not make good. He set
a*ll fears aside when he entered the
'box and began to pitch shutout ball
from the getaway moment.
"Brick" Devereaux's low throw to
Streib in the third inning let Williams
through with the only run for the
Siwashes. Buchanan's twisting was
perfect in every inning. He had his
control just as of yore and he mixed
'em up in such an effective manner
that the best the Siwashes could get
was three hits.
Williams tossed a splendid game for
Seattle, but he had only an amateur
in the person of young Oswald to hold
his offerings and the lad could hardly
fill the bill. The Commuters managed
to sneak in a hit or so whenever /they
got men on the bases and in this way
three runs were coaxed over- the
plate.
Outside of the pitching of Buchanan
the game was devoid of any startling
feature. Kruger is back at work again.
With his full team in the field, Lohman
thinks he can take two from the Si-*Â»
washes to-day. Lohman would like to
see Sandow Mertes, the New York
Giants' center fielder, in an Oakland
uniform. The score:

The weak apology for an exhibition j
of the national pastime played at I
Recreation Park yesterday was prob
ably the worst of its kind ever de
cided in this city on a Saturday after
noon. It contained absolutely noth
ing that would go to enthuse a fan,
and abounded In the worst kind of
baseball. San Francisco won, score.
5 to 3.
The handful of bunkoed fans who
shivered on the bleachers devoted
most of-, its time to saying unkind
things to the men who were endeav
oring to play ball. At that their en
deavors did not get them much, for
each and every one of them went
about h!s task in a sort of half-heart
ed way, and was probably thinking all
the time about what was going to be
passed out at the supper table.
The Seals managed to win the
game by giving Mr. I. Butler, man
ager of the Brownies, an awful beat
ing in the fifth inning. Every man
on the team woke up for just a mo
ment and nearly half of them took a
sound wallop at the sphere. In con
sequence, four runs loomed up and
after that Brother Joe Corbett did not
trouble himself about pitching in his
most gracious manner, for he saw
there was no necessity.
The Seals played a game that
should have entitled them to second
money. They made the rankest kind
of senseless blunders at the critical
stages, and only providence and lack
of ability and baseball sense pre
vented the Brownies from running
tfie score up so hieh that no one could
touch it. The game was without one
redeeming feature.

Cooney, who was an expert sailor and
fisherman, went to Santa Cruz Island

friends and camped at Ladys Harbor.
He spent most of his time in a small
skiff fishing and last Monday left for
the fishing grounds.
Cooney's friends became anxious
when he failed to return Monday night
and instituted a search. They found
no traces of the missing man. but \ateT
his skiff was discovered, bottom up,

Tenth streeti last night in honor of
George B. Keane. its choice for Sen
ator in the Twenty-third Senatorial
District. Louis Berger, president of
the club, acted as chairman, and
Robert McCann as secretary. After
opening remarks by Louis Berger Mr.
Keane made an eloquent speech. Ed
ward L. Nolan then addressed the au
dience on the issues of the day. Fran
cis McNamara, candidate for the As
sembly, made a speech which was
well received. Remarks were also
made by John J. Mahoney, H. Mc-
Mann and others.
Both Haskins and Byrne are young
men with many friends, and, though
the Republican leaders predict the
election of Haskins, the Democrats are
not willing to concede. the correctness
of their position. They point to the
fact that not only is Byrne a native
son of unquestioned integrity, but that
he has two nominations, either one of
which would insure him a large vote.
Altogether the contest is an interest
in and Byrne intf?nds to fight it
tfirough to the finish with every pros
pect, he says, of defeating his oppo
nent.

Kcane Is Honored.
There is an interesting contest go
ing on in the Twenty-fourth Senatorial
District between Philip J. Haskins, the
Rc-publican nominee, and John P.
Byrne, the Democratic and Union La
bor candidate. This is the only even

a fight on this year and this was occa

Into the book which reflected in any
way upon the honor and Integrity of

considered of sufficient importance by
the Democratic managers to be repro
duced In the press of the country and
there is no doubt that it created a fa
vorable Impression for the Democratic

has on several occasions made most

President's intelligence, but against
his sincerity. To be blunt and brief,
he has charged both the President

mail upon the corporations of this
country by attempting, to extort from
them campaign funds with the under
standing that with contributions they
may purchase immunity from of
fenses already committed or yet to be
committed.
MOST INFAMOUS CHARGE.
â¢'This is a most infamous charge.
It is a charge which we most indig
nantly and emphatically deny. There
I? not one iota of truth in it. With
out doubt some of the large corpora
tions have made contributions to the
Republican campaign, but so have
others to the Democratic campaign. I
have not the slightest doubt that in
fome cases the corporations may have
contributed to both parties. But Judge
Parker's statement that the chairman
of the Republican National Commit
tee was selected for the purpose of
and has succeeded in levying contri
butions upon unwilling subscribers or
that he has received contributions
from large corporations on any kind
of conditions of immunity, is absolute
ly false. I do not know which is the
most atrocious, to be guilty of such
a charge or to make it and not be
able to substantiate it.
"Judge Parker in his speeches fre
quently refers to the pure and unde
filed stream of politics from which he
emerged and was advanced to the
New York judiciary. Judge Parker,
if I am not mistaken, was closely as-
Fociated with the managers that elect
ed David B. Hill Governor of the
State of Xew York. I do not see how
any man can be identified with Dem
ocratic politi( : i the State of New
York without knowing- more or less
obout the working of the Tammany
machine, and where is there in all this
country or in any country a more
paring and conspicuous example of
levying tribute than the practice of
Tammany in New York City? To
charge Republican campaign manag
ers with adopting Democratic prac
tices that now prevail and always
have prevailed in New York City is
doing nothing more than to try to
throw dust in the eyes of the people."
MAKES SI'KCIAL APPEAL^
Morton dwelt on the inability of the
Democratic party to administer its
own affair? because of dissensions in
Its ranks, one section heading toward
gold and one toward free silver; one
toward free trade under Cleveland and
one toward protection under Gorman,
and others toward an iirome tax anÂ«l
Ft ill others away from such n tax. The
Democratic party, he added, "is a
conglomerate mass of discontent, an-1

show 40 per cent prold Democracy. 40

a trace of brass and the rest popu

want to make a special appeal to the

from beginning to end of his remarks,
being frequently applauded. The fol

tary's address:

party for what he declared were its
paramount issues â free silver in ISOl',
Imperialism in 1900 and "th>* Repub-

At Republican State headquarters in
this city the prediction is made that
Roosevelt's plurality In California will
exceed 50,000. It is predicted further
that a solid Republican delegation to
Congress will be elected. It is also fig
ured that the Republicans will carry
all but two of the State Senatorial dis
tricts and elect sixty-seven of the
eighty Assemblymen. On joint ballot
the Legislature will probably stand:
Republicans 100
Democrats 20
The Democratic campaign managers
do not concede Republican success in
the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth and
Sixth Congressional districts. At Dem
ocratic headquarters the claim is made
that Bell will carry the Second District,
but figures by counties are not given to
support the claim. The % Call obtains
from Democratic sources Bell's own
figures. He claims these majorities:
G lenn S75
Colusa 775
Tolo 250
Lake 150
Mendoclno 150
Xapa 400
Total 2100
He concedes that McKinley will car
ry Sacramento by 700 and Marin by 500.
Ke counts a stand-off in Yuba, Butte,
Sutter and Sonoma, and thus figures
out a majority for himself of 1000.
The Republican State Committee pre
dicts that McKinlay's majorities will
be:
Butte 200
Sutter 100
Sonoma 400
Mendocino 150
Yuba 100
Sacramento 800
Marin 700
Total 2450
It Is figured that Bell may get these
majorities:
'Glenn 150
Colusa 500
Lake 100
Yolo 200
Total 950
Each party claims Napa County by a
small majority.
The Republicans contend that Mc-
Kinlay will be elected by 1500 majority.
United States Senator George C. Per
kins was at Republican headquarters
yesterday. He gave a glowing account
of the great meeting in San Jose night
before last, saying:
"The numbers assembled and the en
thusiasm manifested reminded me of
Governor George C. Pardee and Dun
can E. HcKinlay will address the peo
ple of Santa Rosa to-morrow night.

I WILL PAY "1&QOO FORFEIT
For a case of Nervous .Debility, Varicocele, Rheumatism. Lame Back, Lumbago, Sciatica, any case of Kidney Disease (that has not gone as far as
Bright's Disease), Indigestion, Constipation, or any weakness which I cannot cure with my new improved Electric Belt, with electric suspensory tor
men (no charge), the marvel of electricians, the most wonderful curative device that has ever been introduced.
Give me a man broken down from dissipation, hard work or worry, from any cause which has sapped his vitality. Let him follow my advice
for three months and I will make him as vigorous in every respect as any man of his age. ' .: _
I will not promise to make a Hercules of a man who was never intended by nature to be strong and vigorous. Even that man I can make
better than he is; but the man who has been strong and has lost his- strength I can make as good as he ever was.
I can give back to any man what he has lost by violation of the laws of nature. I caM stop all drains upon his vitality in ten days.
A man who is nervous, whose brain and body are weak, who sleeps badly, awakes more tired than when he went to bed. whp is easily dis-
couraged, inclined to brood over imaginary troubles, who has lost ambition and energy to tackle hard problems, lacks the animal electricity which
the Dr. McLaughlin Electric Belt supplies. _ . .
The whole force of vitalityin your body is dependent upon your animal electricity. When you lose that by draining the system in any
manner my Belt will replace it and will cure you.
Mr Harry IT. Jackson Vaileton, Cal.. writes October 1: "Although you are a stranger to me. my heart warms toward you as a great benefactor and friend, and I am
more than' aratetu! to you. Already 1 feol thÂ» vigor of new life' in my body; no aches and no pains. I wish you every success In your work."
Letters like that tell a story which means a great deal to a sufferer. They are a beacon light to the man who has become discouraged from
useless doctoring. I get such letters every day.
My Belt has a wonderful influence upon tired, weak nerves. It braces and invigorates them, and stirs up a great force of energy in a man.
I make the best electrical body appliance in the world, having devoted twenty years to perfecting it. I know my trade. My cures after
everything else has failed are my best arguments.
J. i\ Barney, 110 Oak Ft.. San Francisco: "I can speak a good word for your Belt. It has done all I asked for It. It has cured my lame back and when I first got the
Belt I could not bend over to pick up a pin. '< .' ' â Â¦ â¢ , ,, . . r- - -
Give me a man with pains in his back, a dull ache in his muscles or joints, come-and-go pains in his shoulders, chest and side, bciatica
in his hip, Lumbago, Rheumatism, or any ache or pain, and my Belt .will pour the oil of life into his aching body and drive out every sign of pain.
No pain can exi?t where my Belt is worn.
Mr. J. L. Balrd of Orland, Cal., writes October 13: "My back Is entirely well, ami I would net take $1CO for my belt If I could not get another. It Is the best thing on
esrth for a lame back." " % ,
And these "old" men. these men who have burned the candle at both ends â or even if they haven t â these men who for one reason or an-
other feel that life has lost its spice, that they arc getting old too fast, I can make them feel the sparkle and fire of youth again.
I'll never forget when Mr. A. Crawford of Pokegama, Oregon, an old man of seventy, wrote to me and said: "When I wrote to you last I
told you to send me a Belt to make an old man young, and you did. I am seventy years old, and since I have worn the Belt I feel as strong as I
did at thirty-five, and can do as good a day's work as I could at that age." Jt was two years ago that Mr. Crawford wrote me that letter. Here is
one I just got from him:
"In reply to your letter I am glad to say that I am just as much in favor of your Belt as I ever was, for it has been a remarkabls help to me. I am seventy-two years old.
but I do not look any more than fifty. Am enjoying perfect health, and will continue to recommend the Belt, as I have been doing right along, as I realize that but for It I should
have been dead and buried by this time." Â¦ â¢ >-". - _ * v . .' ....'- ' . Â¦*-* Â¦Â» r t . .- , Â»-. - ~ .
They come every day from everywhere. There is not a town or hamlet in the country which has not cures by Dr. McLaughhn s Electric Belt.
Now, what does this mean to you, dear reader? If you are not what you ought to be. can you a.sk any better proof to make you try it? Is
there a remedy which is as simple, as easy to use, as sure to cure and as cheap as Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt? I have not seen one. You must
try it. In justice to yourself, and to those who look to you for their 1 future happiness, try it now. Act this minute. Such a matter ought not to be
It's as good for women as for men. Worn while you sleep, it causes no trouble. You feel the gentle, glowing heat from it constantly, but no
sting, no burning, as in old-style belts. i : " .,/ V J^. :'.;.Â¦_

names of some of your friends whom I have^ cured. :.;v; : Y ;

Two gailors of the Alexander, John
Smith and James Hawkins, deserted
durins the spring: at Cape Prince it
Wales. The vessel was moored to a
cape of ice and was 2S0 miles away
from the nearest port, but the tvo men
concluded to travel, go one night they
put un all their extra clothes, jumped
on the rocking ice floe and headed
Fouth. After suffering great hardships
from cold and hunger they arrived at
Nome and joined the army of
penniless men there. The Alexander is
moored at the head of Union street
vharf. and just astern of her is tht
Narwhal, while next in the line is the
Thrasher. Captain Tilton of the Alex

Alexander for threo years.
The Narwhal brought down 2000
pounds of bone for the Bowhead in ad
dition to the Alexanders 7000 pounds.
Since sending these consignments away
the Bowhead has captured throe whales.
The Alexander's catch will bring her
owners in over $65,000.

"FIRST STEPS," by Giacomo Mantegazza.
This beautiful picture, which is the work of the celebrated Italian art-
ist, Giacomo Mantegazza, is one of the best ever produced by this artist.
The human interest in the subject, as well as the wealth of color, make it
I most attractive to every lover of a fine picture, in which a beautiful child
is the central figure.
The artist has depicted the most lively interest on the part of the
whole party watching the little one's first efforts to stand alone and to walk,
and in the portrayal of the gorgeous costumes of the figures, as well as
the magnificent furnishings of the apartment, he has produced a most
pleasing picture.
These new Art Supplements are universally pronounced the finest and most valuable ever given with
any newspaper.
The demand for them is enormous and unprecedented. The only way to be sure of getting them is to
see your newsdealer or newsboy and V ' .

Weekly Bank Statement.
Cold-storage Butter, is quoted still lower,
but the fresh grades remain unchanged. There
are still large lines of creamery- of popular
brands, but deteriorated by lying a long tirn*
on the floors, which the trad* are trying to
work off. This Butter, fancy as to brand,
but no longer as to - quality, will have to be
got out of - the way before the market will
steady. In the meantime. If cold storage con
tinues pressed for sale at declining quotations,
there will not be much chance for steadiness
in fresh goods. Some houses â¢ are reporting
less depression : in newly arrived creamery and
are anticipating a steadier situation ere long,
but the present condition, is one of continued
demoralization. - - Â¦
Cheese continues firm, with stocks moderate.
./Another advance in. ranch Eggs, is reported
and fresh Eastern are also quoted higher. At
the same : time dealers report- that : the hotels
and -restaurants can no longer afford to buy
the 5 costly ; ranch and have transferred their
purchases to ' Eastern and storage good*. This
cuts -into the local demand, and in conse
quence . the market is not cleaning up as eag
erly; as It has for several weeks back., It Is
etlll- practically bare, however, as receipts are
light. : -

CHICAGO. Nov. 5. â Early In the scission
sentiment in the wheat pit was rather bearish.
The depression was due to a variety of
reasons, the principal one being lower cables,
more liberal receipts Northwest and rain
reports from Oklahoma. Pit traders were fair
sellers at the start. Initial quotations showed
losses, December being down %c at $1 11^4.
May was off ijc to }Â£c to %o
to V>c at $1 10% @1 H14. There was
a fair demand from commission houses,
but the volume of trading was com
partlvely light. The main cause of Inactivity
was a desire quite generally expressed among
traders to hold aloof until arter the holiday.
A partial revival of interest occurred during
the latter part of the session, the market be
coming quite firm on moderate covering by
Ehorts. "-."'â¢
Part of the buying was due to a local crop
expert's report which, while admitting that
winter wheat conditions are generally good,
claimed that the drought Is severe in Kansas.
Reports of sales of cash wheat for Buffalo at
half a cent ove r the price of the May delivery
caused some additional covering. Just before
the close the Decemher option sold up to
$1 12% and May to $1 11%. Final quotations
on December are %c higher at $1 12. and
May closed li'SUc up at $1 11%.
There was a Jight scalping trade in corn
over a narrow range of prices. December
closed %@Â«c up at 48%Â«N8%c.
In the oats matket trading was very quiet.
December closed a* 28%c, %@Uc up.
Provisions were Xasy early, but firmed up
later At the close January pork was up a
shade', lard was 2%c higher and ribs were a
shade higher.

Dried Fruits. Nuts, Raisins, Honey.
The New York Journal of Commerce says
of that market: "Probably never before at
this time of the year since the business In
California Dried Fruits assumed Important
proportions have available spot stocks been
so short or the outlook for additions to tha
supply so uncertain. The latter condition Is
due to the interruption of the process of cur
ing fruits by the recent unfavorable weather
on .the, coast and subsequent delay In ship
ments. This Is particularly true of raisins,
which as a late crop suffered more than other
fruits from the effects of early rains."

"There is a little freer movement reported
In Prunes on orders from country buyers, but
purchases are rarely more than 25 or 50 box
lots. Spot supplier of Prunes available for the
ftilicg of Â»uch orders are light, tbÂ« arrival*
continuing on a small scale, while the bulk is
deliverable to Jobbers on orders placed some
time eince. The Santa Clara Valley market is
developing a decidedly better tone, which is
attributed mainly to the reported destruction
of fully 60 per cent of the crop in outside dis
tricts This is said to be throwing into the
valley orders from outside packers who early
*old on a very low basis and now find them
#elvÂ»s ur.able to make deliveries out of the
crop* in their own districts. Some sellers of

fhlpment at low prices have got an extension
Ot time from buyers and are buying the goods
or are turning over the business to others

epot or forward delivery continue light, but
the majority of jobbers seem to have enough
goods bought Jor the present, and th* scarcity
of supplies Is without effect upon market
prices except to keep them very firm. There
are few fancy seeded out of the old crop to be
had. Buyers do not s^em to be interested in

being urged. There is a great scarcity of

the afternoon and most of them were turned

hard to sell. Apples continued to arrive
freely, three .fresh carloads of Oregon stock
being marketed. , Prices were unchanged, but

good demand for shipment to the north. Some
fine Isabellas sold up to $1 per crate.- A

Portervllle was on eale and the market was
a little- weaker, with $3 50 an extreme figure
for well -colored stock. Several- small ship

COFFEE: â C. E. Blckford's circular gives
the receipts at this port thus far. this year
at 207.651 bags against 23S.S52 for the same
time last year. The sales from first hands
were 193,069 bags, against 229,137. The stock
In first hands November 1 was S4.52O bags,
against 34.722. The world's visible supply
November 1 was 14,330,708 bags, against 13.
918.131 last year. The circular says:
"This and other markets have presented no
interesting features during October, the month
being a dull one and. where quotations have
undergone any change whatever, are slightly
lower as the net result of thirty days* slow
business. ' Local conditions are as previously
stated, trading having been confined almost
wholly to coffees salable below 10c, while top
grades continue neglected and decidedly
weaker on offers to sell.
"Brazil conditions are foreshadowed to im
prove, to the extent that the receipts at the
two ports it Is thought will steadily diminish
from now on. leading naturally to. a monthly
reduction in the world's visible supply for
some time to come if those conclusions 1 ' are
borne out. as is likely. October receipts at
the ports were about 1.445,000 bags; Novem
ber figures - are estimated to-day at 950.COO
to 1.000,000 bags.
"To-day's first hand stock consists of 12S4

presumed to be fairly good, to eay the least.
To Intending purchasers I now say that
equal value for $1000 has not been offered
In villa sites In this vicinity since the found-
Ing of the Stanford University.
And now PLEASE NOTE: I am directed
by the owner to change twelve beautiful
foothill villa eltes into cash, and In order
to do so quickly to offer them for $1000 each,
first come first served. Some are well wood-
ed with beautiful oaks, and all have water.-
piped through a 6-inch main. All are less
than two miles from Menlo and less than
two and a half miles from the university.

"DEAF MUTES"â Several recently made to
hear and SPEAK what they heard: Numer-
ous witnesses, one belns Mr Butler, well-
, known S. F. CHRONICLE representative.
"TOTAL DEAFNESS" Rexradlo finds to be
a. mere BAGATELLE; nearly every case
begins to hear "whispered" words after
Si 3 Â«econds J 4 treatment (Deaf mutes the same.) \
"OSSIFIED" LADY. Mrs. Knowles, 379 BarT-
J?ixVT b X (one) trpa tmÂ«nt had her locked AN-
CH1LOSED joints made freely '"movable"
several weeks ago; no "relapse,"- but still
further progress to date.
"BLINDNESS" deemed lmmlnentr within 3
days -Rexradlo restored good sight.
"LEAPING" CRIPPLE; paralysis; dragged
foot, limb nearly "powerless"; 10 seconds' j
treatment and I LEAPED before audience." '
"LONG DISTANCE" HEARING. My ear to- !
tally deaf from childhood: by 1 treatment
heard (whisper) at 70 feet."
"FEMALB WEAKNESS"â My trouble was
quickly removed by Rexradlo.
"CANCER" disappeared In one hour after
Rexradlo's '(one) treatment.
"UP IN THH AIR" In elevator with man
having "crooked" arm (rheumatism). Couldn't
etraighten It. Rexradio was there, too. and
by "moment's" touch straiffhteprd It before
descending elevator stopped. Editor of TOWN
TALK was present. Witnessed by me â
- WILLIAM ORMSBY.
"BEDRIDDEN"â I saw Rexradlo treat man
for years "helpless" In bed, had to be
"lifted" In and out of bed; Instantly rose
(unaided) from bed. Other similar cases.
"REXRADIO'S" (one) treatment straightened
my "bent" limb (rheumatism).
"TYPHOID FEVER"" overcome by only 2
treatments; no RELAPSE. â Knott. 112 Fell.
"LOCOMOTOR ATAXI A"â Couldn't stand un-
supported; 1 treatment Tuesday and Instant-
ly stood, walked "unsupported."
"ANCHYLOSIS" of knee; couldn't straighten
leg or move knee; did both Instantly.
"HE SEES" objects (outlines) at 3<) feet;
eyes "blind" 7 years (1 treatment Tuesday).
"RRXRADIO'S" 1 treatment entirely removed
my "dropsy" and straightened limb.
"SUICIDE" avoided: protracted disease ren-
dered life a burden; often thought of sui-
cide, after spending largely, vainly, for re-
lief; then Rexradio made quick, complete
cure, months ago; no RELAPSE.
"REXRADIO" rescued me quickly from thÂ»
_flery purgatory of "neuralgia.*
"ANCHYLOSIS of joints, knees, ankles, hips,
toes, fingers, wrists, elbows, shoulders, neck, j
etc., which others deem 'Incurable.' have

panies her husband to the Coast.
At a meetins called by the stewards
of the Pacific Jockey Club and held
in the rooms of the New California

NIAGARA FALLS, Nov. 5.â Miss
Carrie Wahl, daughter of Mr. N and Mrs.
Adam Wahl of this city, is believed to
have made .a sensational attempt at
suicide in the Niagara River this af
ternoon. Her rescue was thrilling In
the extreme. She now lies in Memorial
Hospital in a precarious condition. She
re'fuses to make a statement to the
Coroner and even her own mother has
been unable to extract' from *her a rea
son for her act.
Â¦ Miss Wahl was employed in the of
fice of the Natural Food Company.
After the noon hour she left her work
saying that -she did not feel well. An
hour/ later .she was discovered floating
down the river, several . hundred yards
above. the brink of the American Falls.
Some boys on Willow Island heard her

burglaries that have recently engaged

The scene of their operations was at
the residence of Charles Evers, a team

stone's throw of the Seventeenth
street police station. Jewelry worth
$100 was stolen. ; The thieves were seen
by persons living in the rear of .the
building and Detectives Graham and
Fitzgerald have an excellent descrip
tion of the culprits.
. Shortly after the ; noon hour yester
day Mrs. Evers left home on a trip
down -town.- About an hour later two
women â¢ living immediately in the rear
saw two boys mounting a ladder in the

screams and saw her clutch wildly at
the rocks of the old Wing 1 dam at the
head of the island. They called for
help and Arthur Brady and George
Haney, who were working near at
hand, responded.
At- the risk of their lives the men
made their way out on the rocks and
waited until the woman came near
them. Both men were in imminent
danger of being swept into the rapids
and over the falls, but they plucklly
made their way forward and finally
Haney succeeded in grasping the
young woman by the hand. With
iSrady's help, he pulled her upon the
rocks and the two men then began the
task of getting . the now unconscious
woman back to the 'shore.

with their burden the woman was
placed in an automobile and taken to

and hat were found at the foot of

placed them before her desperate at

There is an old saying. "A penny

habit of putting away the money
you otherwise spend for nothing, that
money is really earned. Saving Is the
great secret of financial success* Begin

neighbors called to the lads, but re
ceived no response. Nothing more -was
thought of "the "matter "until* the burg
lary was reported... -
i Mrs. Evers returned Â« ; home about 5
o'clock and? upon entering her bedroom
was' startled to find a heap of laths
and plaster scattered over the room. A
gaping hole in the deiling, two hatchets
on the bed and a burning candle on a
dresser told the story. . An examination
of the bureau drawers disclosed the loss
of two gold- watches, a chain and
locket and stick pin.
The police. were immediately, notified.
The] detectives found the burglars had
entered the blind attic of the house
through . an .outside ,â¢ trapdoor,' which
was reached with the : ladder. : A hole
was chopped through the bedroom ceil
ing and tho house was then; ransacked.
Every; drawer was examined, but only
the valuables were taken. During a
search of the china closet with a can
dle the shelf paper was set on fire and
considerably burned. In their haste the
thieves overlooked $30 -hidden in a,su
gar, bowl. 5 ;. ;
cisco, while on a visit to France a few,
months ago, saw in the flesh the man
who was long ago accounted among
the dead. The recognition was com
plete, for the San Franciscan had
known Keefer well in his gala days
about the Palace Hotel eight and ten
years ago.
The tourist was leisurely making his
way about Paris when he met Keefer,
who appeared to be idling along in a
stroll. The latter returned the greet
ing, but immediately became frigid and
moved away. There, could be no mis
taking of the identification, it is said,
and the friends of Keefer give credence
to the sensational information that
was brought back from France.
The theory of murder was generally
accepted by the folk of Calaveras, and
the many friends in San Francisco
would listen to no other explanation
than that of foul play. Keefer was en
joying all the best things of life, his
fortune was rapidly growing 1 , Jt was
believed, and his buoyancy of spirit
was such as to preclude the idea that
he was himself responsible for his
strange disappearance. Suggestion of
suicide was regarded as utterly unten
able, and there was absolutely no rea
son, it was argued, for him to run
away. These surmisings almost led to
a direct charge of murder agannst a
suspect.
Keefer'8 sister. Mrs. Martha Davids,
â¢whose home is at 422*4 Seventh street
in this city, continued for years to
prosecute a search for some trace of
her lost brother. She, too, believed
that he had been murdered, but there
could be no avenging of the crime, for
cot the slightest clew was ever discov
ered to lead the detectives beyond the
dilapidated hat.
The years rolled on and Mrs. Davids
and the friends who had aided her
Kave up the hopeless search. Every
avenue of investigation had been ex
hausted, every possible theory had
been worked out, and the devoted sister
at last reconciled herself to the harsh
conclusion that she would never, learn
how her brother came to his death
nor who accomplished it, for she was
firm in the conviction that he met
foul play when walking: alone among
the foothills, engrossed In the constant
plannlngs of his Napoleonic brain.
Keefer had made no disposition of
his property Interests. There was some
real estate In San Mateo County and
other property, valued altogether at
about $3000. But in addition to this he
tad many thousands of shares in the
Calaveras Mining Company, which he
had promoted with such picturesque
ness of method and of which he was
the manager. This 6tock, however, be
came Involved In litigation with A. B.
Thompson, whom Keefer had Induced
tc join him in the venture.
A fÂ«w weeks ago Mrs. Davids . ap
plied to the Superior Court' for letters
of administration on the estate of her
brother. Seven years had elapsed,
and, as the law provides, she' asked to
have him declared legally, dead. The
case Is pending now, and as if a mes
sage from the dead, the report Is re
ceived that Keefer is alive and well,
spending his days In a quiet home fn
one of the suburbs of Paris.
A trustworthy citizen of San Fran-
No man ever set a hotter pace In San
Francisco than "Windsor A. Keefer.
'So mining promoter was ever more
bold in his exploitations. No person
ever dropped more suddenly from the
sight of fellow men and buried himself
more completely in impenetrable mys
tery than he did almost eight years
ago. And now, when it is petitioned
to have him declared legally dead,
comes the startling: â almost grew
fome â announcement that he is enjoy
in? the Quiet of a secluded life in
Paris.
The last that had been known of
Keefer was at a mine he was develop
ing 5n Calaveras County on a grand
fccale in 1897, and no further than the
finding of his torn and battered hat
on a side hill could the detectives go in
their efforts to ascertain what had be
come of him.
