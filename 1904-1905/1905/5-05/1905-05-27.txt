The record up to this evening shows
that the Mayor has ten select Council
men and -twenty members of the Com
mon Council with him. In the Select
Council there art forty- two members.
To paw the ordinance over the Mayor's
veto needs twenty-six votes, and the
Mayor seventeen to sirs tain him. The
membership of the Common Council Is
e!ghty-fotir. Here the organization
needs fifty-one and the Mayor thirty
four.
"Iht situation is growing brighter
every minute," said Mayor Weaver late
to-day. He would not give figures nor go
tr.to other details, but contented himself
â¢with saying ne had received assurances
from many Councllmen who had voted
for the lease last week that they would
support hira in his veto. Leaders of
the Republican organization, which Is
advocating the lease, continue to re
main silent. There are. however, signs
that â¢uveral Coundlmen are breaking
away under tremendous pressure from
their constituents and will probably go
\u25a0Jong with the Mayor. The all absorb

Mayor will be able to defeat the .'bill

for passage over his veto. The organ

that It will pass the ordinance In spite
of his disapproval.

forty-fifth General Assembly of the
Southern Presbyterian church ad
journed this afternoon. Moderator
Plunkett called the next session to
meet at Greenville. S. C, on the third
Tuesday in May. 1906.
The discussion of the question of fed
eration with other branches of the
church was long drawn out. In the
end the question, by a vote of 93 to 81,
was merely referred back to its com
mittee, to which were added three more
members. The committee was instruct
od to bring another plan of federation
before the next assembly. The vote
on the question of union was a close
one. Four ballots were taken before
a decision was reached.
WINONA LAKE. Ind.. May 26.â 80 th
scssiuns of the General Assembly of the
Presbyterian church were devoted to-day
almost entirely to a discussion of the re
ports of the committee on forms of serv
ice &nd the committee on temperance.
For three hours the report on forms of
service was debated by at least 100 speak
ers, chief among whom were Dr. Henry
Van Dyke, chairman of the committee,
and author of "The Book of Prayer."
and Justice Barlan of the Supreme Court
of the United States. The debate was
about equally divided, with the result
that the report, together with the "Book
of Prayer," which it was suggested
should be adopted by the General As
scrclriy as a part of a fixed form of serv
ice, was referred to an enlarged commit
tu*t. Resolutions adopted provide:
"In case the enlarged committee reach
a definite and satisfactory- completion of
their work daring the present year, we
authorize the publication of the book of
worship by the board of publication and
Sunday-school work, in order that the
church rcay have the opportunity to test
the forms of worship and prayers and
the eommlHee is to make its final report
to the next General Assembly."
The assembly dosed late in the after
noon with a vigorous debate over the res
olutions offered by the temperance com-
Eiittee. The debate was precipitated by
Rev. Alfred Kelly of Frazer > Pa., who
declared that there :s one Presbyterian
university which permits its students to
buy intoxicating liquors from a resort
near; the campus. He asked the assembly
to pass a resolution wbicn would stop
the practice. When a commissioner asked
that the university be named on thÂ» floor
of the assembly, he was answered by
cries of "No," and during the debate the
name cf the school was not spoken.
Before adjournment the assembly
passed a resolution censuring the man
agement of any college or university
permitting the students to drink intox-
Irating liquors. The use ctf tobacco
and the manufacture and sale of cigar
ettes were condemned.

Bradstreet's- to-morrow will say: /..
Wholesale trade is reasonably quiet,
pending a clearer, view of the .crop.qu't
turri, which, owing to irregular or unset
tled weather in wide areas, still lacks
definite form. Cool weather is still a
bar to fullest activity at retail. . Manufac
turing, activity is still in large volume
on orders previously booked. Speculative
markets; for wheat reflected the tech
nical conditions, and short supplies in
primary markets more clearly; than : they
do 1' the slight deterioration in v quantity
and -; quality indicated as resulting from
recent backward weather. Collections re
flect "little \u25a0 more than \u25a0 seasonable /slow
ness,' and money is easy and in, abun
dance. Rather-more friction in labor
matters is^noted at Chicago,. the expected
ending of the teamsters' strike being de
layed. Some few 'points of labor friction
are noted in other, cities.. Despite efforts
to ; accentuate less favorable happenings
for stock speculative purposes,- there is
still abundant evidence that the country's
consumptive requirements are on a large
scale, heavily ' exceieding -a year ago at
this time, and the movement can be ma
terially quickened by ' more seasonable
weather, allowing of belated retail buy :
ing materializing and ordinary j crop : de
velopments "occurring. Railway earnings
for the first half of the month of May
exceed a year ago by 6.5 per cent.

â¢ The annual competitive drill and xniHr
tary concert .- of . the First Regiment,
League -of the Cross Cadets, Colonel
James E Power commanding, at the Me
chanicÃ'.' Pavilion, last night, proved a
brilliant success. In the reviewing stand
were his > Grace the Most Reverend Arch
bishop - Montgomery; Brigadier Genera\
Frederick Funston, commanding the De
partment of - California, attended by his
aids, Lieutenant E. C. Long and Lieu
tenant B. J: Mitchell; :Adjutant General
J. B. Lauck, N. G. C; Colonel R, Wieneke
and Colonel S. J. Hendy. aids to the
Governor, and many priests of San Fran
cisco and bay cities,. Including the Rev.
Father Philip O'Ryan, spiritual director
of the League of the Cross. /The judges
of the competitive drill were Captain Ar
thus \u25a0 Kerwin, Thirteenth Infantry; Lleu-^
tenant Frederick Coleman and Lieuten
ant H. A.- Hanigan, Thirteenth Infantry.
, The programme opened with a concert
, by i the l band under direction of Lieuten
ant E.- G... Williams, and at the close the
first,-; second and third battalions marched
into the spacious hall .with a dash and
precision that won instant and hearty ap
.proval.. \u0084' '. *
General < Funston received the review,
and then followed the competitive drill
for the Colonel E.-J.- Power trophy., Co
mpany. D/. ; Captain ..'Andrew Burke com
manding, was the first to give challenge.
Company. A, Captain P. H. McCarthy
commanding,- showed a soldierly, well,
knit, bright lot of young men. and Com
pany N, Captain H. J. Leonard command
ing, .with, a host of its fellow-townsmen
from â¢ Oakland well to the fore with en
couragement, presented also a smart ap-.
pearance and drilled well. Company L,
Captain Frank Grlmley commanding,
brought upon itself- compliments, 'then
applause and [at the end of the drill a
loud outburst, not alone from Mission Do
lores parish, to which the company be
longs, but from the representatives of ell
other parishes present. '.*
t Every rccvement was watched with the
keenest Interest. - And when ft /was all
over and the judges * retired to count v.p
the points, the announcement came not
as a. surprise that Companies D and L
had tied, each with 257 1-3 points out of a
possible 300.
The judges announced that the two
rival companies must go through three
movements of ten points each, and this
resulted .in Company D's scoring twenty
nine points and Company t,. 2S.
Then Sacred Heart Parish cheered for
its men, the victors, and ttfe Rev. Father
Philip Ryan .hastened forward and con
gratulated Captain BurKe. Archbishop
Montgomery pinned the trophy medal on
the captain's breast. Father McQuaide
was elated because, for the second time.
Company D had proved victors in the
bloodless contest.
There was. a strong* contrast afforded
by the fancy squad drill by Company O,
Captain Thomas O'Day commanding. The
young men were attired In green blouses
and executed a silent drill with splendid
effect, theonly word of command Issuing
from Captain O'Day being a short, snappy
"Hep,"- and left about or right about,
halt, attention, march, ..all followed the
command, "Hep," which with all the
seriousness . and excellence of the drill,
evoked hearty, laughter. â¢

CHICAGO. May 25.-A fresh break in
the price of corn for May delivery to-day,
following the 8-cent decline yesterday,
gave seemingly complete evidence of the
end of the attempted "corner." An addi

the report of I liberal receipts. Arrivals
to-day were 40S cars, with 2SB cars suit
able to deliver on contracts. The wtth
drawal of 125,000 bushels of contract corn
from private elevators was another factor
that tended to discourage, bulls. TbÂ»
market was weak from the start, initial
quotations being oft 3c at 60c. No support
was at hand and the price fell to 57c.
Later. the price dropped to 55*4 c a break

was weak at 5Sc. .

In preparation for a protracted strike
siege; the teamsters' Joint council has
arranged to send agents to all i parts
of the country for the purpose of gath

July ;l '.'â¢: Solicitors probably will start
from* Chicago next week on , this mis
sion. They will visit every local union
In the ' United ' States, according to' the
plan, and ; In addition to urging finan
cial assistance will strive, to arouse
organized labor everywhere to sympa
thize \u25a0 with the present , struggle. - ;;
- One of the â¢ first ] moves of the . strike
leaders to keep the men in line will be
. Significant of the probable ; approach
of a lumber famine In the manufatur
ing: Industries was the shutdown to-day
of the J. W. Landis milling plant. This
company, essayed to do business yester
day under police protection- and gave
it up-
At a meeting of the Associated
Building Trades to-night, at which
twenty-nine trades affiliated with the
industries were represented.
It was decided that no (action will be
taken which will tend to drag the
building- trades Into the teamsters"
strike. -This action on the part of the
building trades will go far toward re
stricting the strike to Its- present lirnts.
as It means that the members of the
Building: Trades Union will work with
materials irrespective of the fact that
they axe hauled In wagons driven by
non-union teamsters.
The Mayor talked as though he had
abandoned hope of a settlement- Alder
man Dever, chairman of the City Coun
cil Peace Committee, appointed a week
ago. said to-night that he had practically
ceased work, as the committee could see
Â»o avenue In the controversy looking
toward an adjustment of the differences
between the teamsters and the employer*.
Mayor Dunne does not think the situ
ation has changed sufficiently to require
the calling for troops.
President Shea, was ill when on the wit
ness stand to-day, and this fact Is taken
es an Indication that he may retire from
the leadershla of the strike.
BtILDfX; TRADES HOLD OCT.
There i s no movement at present look-
Ing toward a settlement of the strike.
Mayor Dunne to-day, for the first time
elnce the commencement of the team
cters 1 strike, declared that he knew of
no contemplated plans for peace.
The strike to-day spread In a small de
gree throughout the building trades.
There w*re a number of instances where
woodworkers* refused to receive the ma
terial delivered by non-union teamsters
and walked out. This move in every In
stance uas made by the men as individ
uals only. No official action was taken
by any of the material trades unions look-
Ing to active, sympathetic support of the
teamsters' strike. Several of the labor
leaders in the ranks of the material
trades have declared within the last
twelve hours that there is no prospect in
their opinion of any complete tie-up of
the building trades by. a strike of the
men.
At THOKITIES DISCOUICAGED.
This evening rioting was prevalent
throughout the lumber district and par
ticularly in the territory near the inter
section of Thirty-nrth street and Center
evtnae. The lumber wagons returning
Â£rca ranking deliveries were attacked by
crcwds at every available opportunity.
Large numbers of men armed with clubs,
elungshots and bricks, accompanied by
Jeering women and excited children, filled
the sidewalks along Center avenue. Thir
ty-fifth street, Loomis street and Archer
avenue, awaiting the passage of wagons
which were believed by the crowd to be
unguarded. At Archer avenue and Loo
m:s street two trucks appeared with one
policeman on each. They were immediate
ly bombarded with bricks and stones and
ecortt of air rifles were brought into play.
A bullet from one of these weapons seri
ously wounded Policeman James Fltz
patrick in the hand. The two policemen
crew their revolvers and fired over the
heads of the rioters, holding them at bay
until the drivers managed to reach their
destination at the yards of the Ritten
fccuse & Ernbree Lumber Company..
The \u25a0worst fight in the lumber district
occurred at Twenty-second street and
Ashland avenue, where a crowd o# men
end boys had all through the morning
hurled stones and clubs at every passing
lumber wagon. Finally a wagon on which
Police Officer Bagenskl war a passenger
came along, and the mob greeted it with
the usual volley of stones. They also
threatened to attack the driver, and the
situation was so serious that the officer,
drawing his revolver, fired six shots at
the crowd, which broke and fled in wild
confusion. None of the bullets hit any
body.
IVAGO:V!Â» U>Dt'.R FIRE.
CHICAGO. May 26.â Rioting broke out
afresh to-day in the teamsters' strike
and, although nobody was seriously hurt,
there were a number of vicious fights
In the lumber district, during which the
police were compelled to use their clubs
and in one instance revolvers in order to
disperse the mob. ,
A serious fight took place at the corner
of Canal and Madison streets, adjoining
the passenger station of the Pennsylvania
Railroad. The wagon of an express
company, although protected by a police
man and a Deputy Sheriff, was attacked
by & large crowd, despite the, fact that
it bore on each side a large placard de
claring that all people had been enjoined
from interfering with the wagon by the
Federal court. The policeman displayed
hie revolver, but the crowd, paying no at
tention to him. rushed at the wagon and.
seizin? the wheels, attempted to overturn
It. A rlct call brought from the Des
plaines-street police station, four squares
<ilÂ£tant, a large force of officers, who dis
pensed the crowd and arrested about forty
of the most active in the disturbance.

Billiards an Old Game.
The game of billiards may. lay claim
to great antiquity, for in J'Antony and
Cleopatra'" Shakespeare makes Cleo
patra say : "Let us play billiards" ;
and so, unless we accuse the great poet
of error in chronology, we have traced
the game back to a period before the
Christian era. In early times a similar
game was played on the grass or turf
with stones, and later with balls of
lignum vitae and other * " substances.
How to apply the right "twist" or
"English" to the cue ball Is one of the
most - interesting and important- ele
ments in ' the art : of good playing." In
early/times only two ball* were used,
and each player: sought-; simply to
pocket . the . ball of his opponent. The
red ball was introduced as a novelty to
keep the , : game from \u25a0 dying out: As
time has gone/on the game has had a
varied development In different'coun
tries. In Spain they play with three
balls and five wooden pins are set up
in. the middle of the table. In Russia
they l play with five balls, two white
and a red. blue "and yellow one.
.The English game is played quits dif
ferently from \u25a0. the American \u25a0\u25a0 ", and
French games. It is a combination of
the* American games of both pool and
billiards, being played on a table hav
ing pockets as In an ordinary '\u25a0 pool
table, and the points as scored In both
of k the American games being counted.
The French and American tabla with
out pocket* â¢ , and only "canons'* or
''caroms" are counted. In ' America the
game of billiards has ' undergone a
rapid t . development - on ". account of ' thÂ«
great! skill acquired by American play
ers. /Early, in the last ' cenfary "the
game" was commonly played .with four
balls -upon a pool table, more or less
like* the present English game.' for. both
pocketing balls and ' making, caroms
.were 'counted, but In time this : style
of I playing proved . so simple that /a
table was adopted without any pockets
in Itâ and caroms only werÂ« counted.â

ended . by the Judge taking the knotty
question away with_hlm to sleep on over

The sewer was laid through the prem
ises now owned '""by Kales at Lake aivl
Jackson streets in li"6. Kales bought the
place in ISBS and acquiesced in allowing
the sewer to remain where It was, and
it Is now claimed that â¢ he has . forfeited
all right to interfere with It. He claims
that it is a nuisance by reason of , the
fact that his neighbors will not keep up
the repairs, and that the water floods
his barn. The squabble has been on for
some months, but It is expected a de
cision will be handed down shortly which
will either give Kales the right to' wreak
his vengeance on the drain pipe and force
his neighbors to connect with the street
sewer or confirm them in their contention
that they, may maintain" the sewer for

months Hcyneman filed a complaint in
this county in which Mrs. McGauloy

Captain Arga P. Berry, Tenth Infantry
and recently â¢quartermaster of the trans
port Sheridan, ha 3 been ordered under
arrest by the Secretary of War. The or
der was received last night at Vancouver
Barracks, where the Tenth Is stationed,
and is the result of charges preferred by
Major Parke. Fourteenth Infantry., who
was. a passenger on the Sheridan In com
mand of the returning troops. . Major
Parke is credited with stating that Cap
tain Berry -was detected In the "act of
entering the room of a wife of one of his
fellow-officers. In his report of the af
fair Major Parke also enumerated sev
eral minor charges, among them being
drunkenness and general lncompetency.
Orders will probably be at once Issued
for the cdhvening of a board. to try.Cap
tain Berry. ,
A " full denial of the purport of the
charges was made by Berry when the
Sheridan arrived at Portland. April 24.
and he 'attempted to make light of the
affair, but since the War Department has
taken cognizance of them a. court-mar
tial is certain.
The officers of the Tenth Infantry at
Vancouver Barracks confirmed the story
last night that the charges acalnst Cap
tain Berry are. the "outcome or the Sheri
dan affair. It Is further said that it was
the room of the wife of an artillery lieu
tenant that Berry Invaded.
.When the Sheridan arrived In Portland
(torn Manila strong efforts were made to
keep the'; details of theaffalr secret, but
without avail. iSHK

A detective employed by the Grand
Jury is keeping close tab on Smith's
visitors at the County JalL
It. was the last sumptuous meal that
Smith had â the last he will have until
hn is liberated from the State, prison,
to which he is expected to go to-mor
row, and seemingly he made merry
over the fact. While In the company
of Leona Brooks Smith forgot his wor
ries and laughed and joked as if the
mcrrow was to bring him freedom in
stead of carrying him closer to a fel
on's cell. The waiters recognized him
and he returned their greetings with a
smile. It was well along in the morn
ing hours when Smith and his com
panion parted, bidding each other fare
well. As he ?nade his exit from the
place Smith little suspected that . the
detectives were awaiting him and
that they followed him to his home.
Leona Brooks later left the restaurant
and returned to her abode, apparently
more deeply affected by the fate that
awaited tbe man that had lavished his
money upon ber than was the closely
watched embezzler.
Although Smith, In the fare of convic
tion for embezzling the city's taxes, pre
tended that he was suffering the bitter
est repentance and was deeply grieved
for his sorrowing family. It has become
known that on the very eve of preparing
for his long separation from his horne â
that is, the night before he appeared be
fore Judge Lawlor to plead guilty to his
theftsâ he kept an appointment with the
notorious Leona Brooks In an O'Farrell
street restaurant. To I>ona Brooks, the
former denizen of an Ellis street house.
Smith's downfall was partly ascribed,
and yet after begging forgiveness from
his family for the offenses he had com
mitted against his wife and their chil
dren Smith secretly went to the O'Far-
Tell 6treet restaurant and there met
I>eona Brooks, who had preceded him to
Vh" place.
This fact Is known to the Grand Jury,
whose members had the ex-Tax Collector
under surveillance until the hour of his
conviction, and to members of the Pink
erton Detective agency, who were also
closely trailing the Clsgraced official.
Smith and the Brook 6 woman remained
It: the restaurant several hours, during
which they drank wine and partook of
the choicest viands and delicacies, as they
had done often before, when Smith, un
discovered in his peculations, was lavish
ing the taxpayers' coin upon Leona
Brooks and her predecessor In his affec
tion, Lillian Leslie.
â¢â¢If Smith would talk," said Foreman
Andrews, "there would be on earth
quake In this town. He could drag
in:m> more to prison.
There Is a chance that when the de
faulter has been a few months in Fol-
Fom he may talk. It is thought that
when he has worn the convict garb for
a while and realizes that he, who was
only one of a gang. Is the only one pun
ished he may want to have his fellow
crooks made to share his fate.
Foreman Andrews laid his eviflence
before the District Attorney in ' the
presence of Expert Douglas Young.
Byington said the evidence clearly
showed that two rings of grafters had
been working the tax office and the
Treasurer's office, but he advised si
lence until the evidence against each
individual member of the gangs is
oonsplete enough to -warrant convic
tions.
There Is proof, according to the fore
man of the Grand Jury, that the city
has been robbed by two rings of graft
ers, one working in the City Hall, the
other outside. Tiia names of most of
the members of both gangs are known
to the Grand Jury and the entire plot
â¢will be laid bare in a few days. More
than one office-holder will be indicted.
Foreman Andrews is not convinced
that Devoto cashed the $13,590 check
for Smith. Just after his return to San
Francisco the defaulter admitted hav
ing received the money, but he denied
it to Detective Wren while on the way
tit-rÂ«?.
The evidence collected by Foreman
Aadrewi of the Grand Jury as to the
conspiracy behind ex-Tax * Collector
Smith *ras laid before District Attorney
HjlncÂ«on yesterday. So startling are
some of tbe "peculiarltfe*," as AnilrÂ«vs
terms (brm, In the Treasurer's office
and the 'tax office that the District At
torney has advised the foreman to keep
the details quiet until the evidence 1m
complete.

consulted her husband in the purchase
of goods; that he did not pay her bills,
and that she had an independent income
ThÂ« jury, after being out five minutes,
returned a verdict In favorof the plain
tiff for the full amount of $1600.
Mrs. Fish denied that she had worn
the furs to a reception, but said that
on the morning following the arrival
of the furs she took them downstairs
to show some friends. She did. not tell
her husband about the furs at the time
and scorned the insinuation that she
had any dispute with- her - husband
about the price.
"I do not. She has her own income
from her investments," was the reply.
Mrs." FiÂ«h was in court with her hus
band and seemed annoyed. After an
appraisal of $2000 -had been placed on
the muff and tippet, Stephen Keating,
counsel for the furrier, called Mr. Fish
to the stand. When asked his salary
as president of the Illinois Central
Railroad, Fish replied, "About $150,000."
"Mrs. Fish has a large personal
estat*," he said, "and an. income. I
supplement her income by presents on
Christmas and on her birthday."
He said that he paid all the bills for
articles bought for the house, but did
not pay his wife's personal bills."
"Dou you mean to say that you do
not pay for her clothing?" askedVKeat
"l do not," replied Fish.
"But you allow her a certain in

that she selected the two pieces were

Jack Dennis has a promising looking
puppy by Roman Athlete-Fiery Face,
which has the same markings as his sire.
He weighs about sixty-two pounds and is
expected to prove a clever performer.
He is being pointed for the Futurity. Jim
Sweeney, has a black puppy of the same
breeding which has shown a great turn
of speed In private trials.
Many greyhound trainers availed of the
opportunity afforded at Union Coursing
Park last Monday of trying out their
puppies. The youngsters were usually
matched with others of their own age
and some good trials resulted. This gives
them mare experience than being slipped
with aged dogs, but it Is difficult to get a
line on their speed.

for the championship of San Francisco
will be started to-morrow on the Cali
fornia Club courts. Heretofore .the
event has. commenced on .Decoration!
day and has been completed as .soon
thereafter' as possible. The new plan
is an improvement, as It will insure
some good matches for the 30th, when!
the final rounds will be played. As
much of the event as possible "will; be
played to-morrow with; the hopes of
completing the j finals and challenge

Percy Murdock of Alameda is - the
present champion and will defend on
Tuesday. He has had but little prac

his second victory for the cup. ." The.
trophy to be 1 competed for is the Joseph
D. Grant cup, donated two 1 years \u25a0 ago.
J. D. MacGavin was the first man to
have his name Inscribed on the cup and
the first champion to stand out. He
was beaten last year by Murdock In thet.
challenge match.
George Whitney was the first cham
pion. Grant Smith succeeded Whitney,
but" in 1903 was beaten .by . Norman
Hodgkinson in the semi-finals. Hodg
kinson in turn lost to MacGavin in the
finals. The Hodgkinson-Smith- match
was one of the most Ã stubbornly con

The racing sloop Corinthian had a trial
over the cup course with the sloop Nixie
last Sunday and acquitted herself splen
didly. The Corinthians are quite satis
fled from her behavior in the heavy sea
and '.strong breeze of Sunday, April 30,
that 'she can stand any sea or weather.
Commodore W. G. Morrow will try out
the sloop Challenger 'during the holidays
and will' decide on the make-up of his
crew next week. ; .
The annual regatta (the twentieth) of
the Corinthian Yacht Club will be sailed,
according to custom, on Decoration day.
The fleet will* be divided into six classes,
as follows: 20-footers, yawls, 25-footers,
30-footers, 3G-footers and* yachts whose
racing length exceeds thirty-six feet The
20-foot class includes the yawls "Witch
and Kittiwake and the sloops Caprice,
Nlrrettee, Vixen, Kuku and Loiterer.
The yawls are Arcturus. Naiad, Spray,
El Reyo, Acapulco and Truant. The 25
footers are the sloops Cupid.* May, Neva,
Josie, Discovery, Dixie, Hiawatha and
Ruby. The 30-foot class comprises the
sloops Aeolus, Mlgnon, Comet and Cath
erine. In the 36-foot class are the sloops
Emma, Meteor, Edna, Freda, Neptune,
Genesta, Harpoon, ! Presto and Kathleen.
In class 1 one are the sloops Speedwell,
Nixie, Clara, Mischief and Aloha.
The 30-foot class, which in former re
gattas has furniehed the most interest
ing racing, ! has dwindled jto four boats,
the Presto having been enlarged to a 36
footer, the Truant having . been rebuilt
and rigged as a yawl and the Amigo
having. been chartered by a member of
the San Francisco ' Yacht Club. The rac
ing in the 26-foot and the 36-foot classes
will be interesting, the former class in
cluding eight and the latter comprising
nine boats. Among the 36-footers are the
fast yachts Meteor, Harpoon and Presto
and the old rivals Edna and Emma. In
class one the race will be between Com
modore T. Jennings' Speedwell and Ful
ton *G. Berry's Nixie. Both are fast
"boats, in the best of condition and will
be sailed for all there Is in them. .
The fleet of the California Yacht Club
will cruise to Vallejo to-day, returning
to-morrow on the ebb tide.
The schooners Aggie and Chlspa will be
the -scratch boats, and the rest of the
fleet will receive arbitrary handicaps as
follows: Sloop Annie, four minutes;
sloops Thelma, Sappho and Queen and
schooner White Wings, eight minutes;
schooners Virginia and Martha, ten min
utes; sloop Amigo, sixteen minutes;
sloops Ariel ' and Minnetonka, twenty
minutes; sloops Thetis, Nautilus and
White Heather, twenty-two minutes;
sloops Phoenicia and Merope and schoon
er Josephine,, thirty minutes; sloop Cur
lew and yawls Royal and Ripple, thirty
six minutes; yawl ,"Wave, thirty-eight
minutes; sloops Surprise and Juanita,
forty-two minutes; yawl Witch, forty
eight minutes; sloop Zada, one hour and
twelve minutes. The race wlll : be under
the management of the regatta commit
tee, which consists of Roy C. Ward,
Henry G. Toll and Lorlng P. Rixford.
To-day and to-morrow are open dates
on the programme of the Corinthian
Yacht CJub.
The fleet will cruise to McNears Land-
Ing this afternoon and will race down to
morrow. The tide floods from 12:25 p. m.
to 7:33 p. m. at Fort Point to-day, so that
any part of the upper bay can be reached
easily. To-morrow the tide runs out at
Fort Point from 7:48 a. m. to 1:16 p. m.
The fleet will anchor at McNears to
night and will start on the journey down
at noon to-morrow.
The race of the San Francisco fleet
from Vallejo to Sausallto on Sunday, the
13th inst., that was called off on account
of lack of wind, will be. resailed to-mor
r6w. First prize on the former occasion
was awarded to W. G. Morrow's fast
sloop Challenger, the only yacht that
crossed the finishing line off the club
house under sail. Dr. T. L. Hill's sloop
Queen distanced all the rest' of the fleet
and reached Sausalito with a lead over
all the yachts except the Challenger, but
owing to lack of wind and an adverse
tide could not' sail . across the finishing
line. The second and third cups were
not awarded and will be sailed for to
morrow.

The Colorado circuit of harness
racing has already opened, but as its
curly meetings are on a half-mile
track there will not be much fast rac
ing until the horses reach Denver,
â¢where a two weeks* meeting opens. on
June 17. Qu!te a number of California
horses have been shipped to Denver P
W. Hodges. Ben Chaboya. Worth Ober
and other trainers leavingr Pleasanton
on the 20th lntt. A match race for
52000 a side between J. R. Richard
tons Getaway <by Strathway) and S
Bernard's Delia McCarthy (by Mc-
KJnney) will be decided at Denver on
the 29th of June.
Mcnron Salisbury's string of trot
ters does not look quite as formidable
as the one he took over for Mr. Butler
last year, but he has gome good ones
r.overthok?s. , Charles de Ryder, who
is the trainer and. principal driver of
Mr. Butlers horses, thinks highly of
a daughter of Sidney Dillon, which has
been named Helen Keyes. She is well
staked in the oie circuits, but De Ryder
â¢ays they may not start her. but take
her alonjr simply for educational pur
poses. He thinks she will gret a mark
of ?:05 as sure as she stays right. â¢
Among the .Pacific Coast trotters which
are expected to win laurels and money on
the big ring during the summer are
Colonel J. C. Kirkpatrick's John Cald
â¢wtll. which took a record of 2:11^
last year, and js expected to reach 2:07
or better before he comes back in the
fall; Mamie X, the wonderful little filly
Tihlch look a record of 2:15 â¢Â£ last year
us a three-year-old; Morosco, 2:12, win
ner of last season's $2000 California
stake; Mack Mack, 2:12%. an Oregon
horse by MoKinnc-y-Lady Zombro,
\u25a0which trotted a half-mile in 1:02% at
Pleasanton before she was shipped East
ry her trainer. P. W. Hodges, and four
or five others which, are capable of
miles close to 2:10.
A noticeable feature of the large en
try lists received by the associations on
the Grand Circuit that have thus far
closed their principal stakes is the large
proportion of California-bred trotters
that have been named and the com
paratively few pacers from this State.
In some of the largest events, such as
the $10,000 trot at Readville, nearly
one-fourth of the entire entry list are
California horses, but In the pacing
events this State does not make much
of a showing, so far as numbers are
concerned, there being but three or
four California pacers of any class that
have been sent East to race this year.
Sweet Marie, 2:04%, will be the big
drawing card of the Grand Circuit
meetings and there will be a deter
mined effort to defeat her by the own
ers of other trotters. Although her last
year's antagonist, Tiverton, 2.04%, Is
looked upon by some to be about the
only horse that can give her a hard
race, the opinion of well-posted horse
men is that the Eastern-owned but
California-bred trotters â Lisonjero,
S:OSi4; and George G, 2:o6%â are the
ones most likely to make her lower her
record. If she is beaten it wlli prob
ably be a California-bred one that wins
the laurels. Those who watched the
diiughter of McKinney taking her work
this winter at the Los Angeles track
are firmly convinced she is about in
vincible and the greatest race trotter
yet produced. The horse that beats her
this year will have to trot three heats
better than 2:04.
Budd Doble will send Lou Dillon to
Cleveland some time during the next
two weeks, the date of her departure
not having been set. He has given her
the most careful preparation ana the
rr.are is in perfect condition. She trotted
a mile in 2:11 last Saturday, with the
last Quarter in a shade better than :31.
Mr. Billings, who owns her and also
the only other two-minute trotter. Ma
jor Delmar, is arranging for contests
between the two, he to drive one and
H. K. Devereaux of Cleveland the
other. These contests will be the big
features of the amateur matinee meet
ings this year. Mr. Doble will not go
East with the mare, but will ship ,her
in charge of her faithful attendant, Ed
Malloy, who has been with her nearly
two years.
More money â¢will be raced for In Cali
fornia this summer by the trotters and
pacers than that class of horses have
had the opportunity to earn at home
In several years. Los Ang-eles starts oft
on July 3 with $16,200. to be dis
tributed during a six days' meeting.
Fresno follows with $10,000 in purses
and slakes guaranteed by the Pacific
Coast Trotting Horse Breeders" Asso
ciation. The same organization will
give a second meeting in August, at
which close to $15,000 will be disbursed
among the winners. There will be
about JSOOO \o race for at Santa Rosa,
the same amount at Woodland, and the
California State Fair will distribute
between 510,000 and $15,000 to owners
of harness horses. It is safe to say
that $75,000 in the aggregate will be
\u25a0won by trotters and pacers that are in
the money, during the five or six weeks
of racing that will comprise the Cali
fornia circuit of 1905.

This morning when the smoke of
battle has cleared away from the Pre
sidio athletic gTound3 either.'- Lick", or
Polytechnic high schools will hold the
baseball championship of the San Fran
cisco sub-league of the Academic Ath
letic Leagne. The game will be a fast
and furious one until the last batter
has been retired. The chances for the
game j are about even.
The , game will mean more to the
black and g-o ld, than to the Bu3h-street
school, as it would make the third
consecutive victory of the" tick lad 3
over the high ; schools ;of San Fran
cisco. Polytechnic has . been within
reach of the much coveted honor, twice
to the last few ; years and a victory at
this time would be the goal of its am
bition. The teams will line up; \

RESULTS .OF GAMES.
Surgl place.
The impact was so great that ths front
door was knocked off it 3 hinges and the
glass , panel broken tnta fragment}. The
side of the house where the hinges wera
fastened was. tarn Into splinters before
Miss Surgi realised what had occurred.
The trinkets an the mantelpiece were ;
knocked oÂ£T and broken, but a largs plats
mirror suspended over the. mantel. was.
found en the floor. upside daws, without
a crack, one of tha many freaks played
by the gghtnftig. The plastering to. the,
same- room, and that of the adjoining
room, which was occupied by Miss Surgi.
was torn from the walls and ceiiis?.
The lightning, according to Captain Gal
lido's examination, followed the bell wfir* .
through three rooms aad the kitchen to a j
Trrr^n shelf used for the storage Â» ceCs.
These were found intact, but the current
continued down another wire to tie rear^
of the "house. It must hstve been Inter
rupted, for three boards ta a. featlfcer
f^g9 fence were broken ofT as if th*
work was done by a carpenter.
After cemoUshins the fence tha pow-r
again followed the beH wtr*. going up thÂ« -
steps to a room on the second floor.'
Her* the most startling work, was done,
far every state was torn off tha roof and
the - brick chimney scattered ia almost
every atrection. Same of the . broken
brick were hurled for half m square, while
the flying plaster was converted Into a;
dense cloud. The walls were dtsconnect
lediat the comers and. ks f act. the room'
was a -wreck.'
! Miss Surgi explained that she went
' through the whole thing wltHont a
i scratch. She attrfbates her escape fronr
j death to a remarkable, combination of
! circumstances, first among which was a.
presentiment that Hghtnmg would strlks
the house, and the ether waÂ» that she
suddenly became afraid and protected
( herself by getting into bed.

A NEW DICTATOR OF FASHION.

THE sinister rumor has been wired, wafted and carried by mail
from Europe across, under and over the stormy 'Atlantic tha{
the shadow of the hoop skirt was rising over the world of fash
ion. The present generation Hardly knows what that means. If
an old fashion plate, as late as the first -years of, our civil war; is
consulted, it will give up the required information. The hoop skirt
was a cage of wire and tape, fearfully a'rid' wonderfully made, J in
which our grandmothers moved about, with an '.amazing-amplitude'
of costume. It disappeared under the' pressure of. war prices for.
dress goods. Economy swung its club and drove fashion off the
field. When calico c^ostas much as summer silk does now, a dress
over an expansion hoop skirt cost enough. to clothe a family in gar
ments of smaller circumference. _
It seems now that. we are not to look to Europe for dictation
:n fashions. There is an American Dressmakers' Association (the
blessings of the grateful are'upon it) vvhich has met in GJhicagp arid
decreed that- the hoop skirt shall -not be worn. That settles it
and that skirt .will remain where it abides, at present, in history.
The president of the dressmakers declared %that > Yankee ingenuity
has solved the problem of shaping skirts by "a moderate amount of
feathcrbone, judiciously distributed." We^don^t'khow whatfeather
bone is. but are willing to bet that it is a. wis N e* and good thing.
/ Seriously this decision 'of 'the aggregated' dressmakers proves
that we have progressed in all directions. We take orders from
nobody, but just issue them to ourselves, in our industries, business,
finance and fashions. Hail to the American dressmakers ! It will
not be long before Europe will be copyingour fasnions, 4 as now dtir
manufacturing methods are copied, and when an American \u25a0 woman
goes abroad she will not have to readapt her dress iin, order .notVto

found it so delightful a place to
live that he induced his old friend and
business associate, Billy Goodman,^ to
come out into the came house and' rent
the apartment 'directly across the hall
from him. It was the more easily dona
because 1 Mrs. Winter and Mrs. .Goodman
were very good' friends, Indeed,'" and
they had never had an. opportunity/ to*
see as much of each* other as they
mutually desired., _; /
For a term of months they were very
happjv together, the four -of them," go lng
to the theater arid to; little supper
parties afterward, taking Sunday '\u25a0ex*'
curslons in rented *\u25a0'. automobiles" and
otherwise enjoying life in a large city.
It might have continued indefinitely if
the Goodman baby had hot been bornâ
indeed, that might not' have .interfered
if the poor llttlfe youngster had not de
veloped colic. Colic, it is perhaps heed
ful to observe, is treated by means of
peppermint;. Holland gin,, catnip tea, 1
ginger, whisky and fourteen or fifteen
Other remedies, taken, singly or. in com
bination. As colic seems <to bo incur
able, except " by time, all that' most of
these medicaments appear to do was to
add a number of rather: unpleasant
odors to the cries of the colicky one.
It has been noticed that children
select: the moments for exhibitions , of
developing lung power that; others
choose for rest, and the Goodman baby
was no exception^ As the child** father
really had to have his night's sleep-so
he could .do his; work 'the next day, -it
was decided to remove, the- youthful
Goodman to, the bedroom most-remote
from that of his parents, where r. he
could scream his blessed little head off,
If need be, without disturbing any one
but the nurse. -Nowthis bedroom 1 was.
en the court which ran between the
Goodman and . the Winter flat, and the
only way it could be-adequately venti
lated was by leaving the window into
the court open all night.
Pretty soon the combination. of : baby
and colic. began Â«tO:make- nearly, every
body in the Pleasant building sit up and
take- notice, generally' in the middle of
the night. Charlie. Winter - undertook
to call hls : chum's fattentlon to itÂ»by
saying thaf he had heard \u25a0;> the i.j baby
talking in his sleep, and Billy opined
that he mustn't believe- all ho- heard;
So nothing was done, not until 'the
Winter's maid arose and. left because
she couldn't sleep for. the noise of the
infant- adjoining and contiguous* to her
own sleeping room, and ho one could
be found to . take her place as j long as
the noise held out. ... :..........â¢.-
Mrs. \u25a0\u25a0; Winter after a particularly . hard
night undertook to ; tell Mrs. Goodman
about-it. and when she paid her Visit and
found- the dear little Goodman youngster
sitting up and smiling back at her as if
he had never had even a* place to put the
colic in, her' courage forsook her and the
word was never said, .much as she dis
liked being without assistance in her
housekeeping. But j something had to . be
done, j \u25a0\u25a0-:.//; ';-* .- : ""/ '.-..\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0' .. : -' "\u25a0'-.-'
The Winters bought an automatic piano
player, and the Goodmansliked.the noise
it made so well that : they bought one.;
The , Goodmans were still one baby, with
the csllc ahead of the " game. ; Charlie
knew a chap who played the cornet,' and
he . asked him--' in j of. evenings. ,:: Billy:, be
lieved that he had a friend who played
the cornet still better and could do stunts
on* the ophicliede'to boot, and. he: used, to
ask the Winters lover . ; to hear him. So
musical instruments were by
tacit consent." .
,At last there was sent. to Mrs. Winter
from the sunny South a- large arid able-,
bodied colored- servant. ; A friend of. hers
knew of the family .being; without -a

THERE is every indication that the immigration ' to this^ country
from Europe will increase both in numbers and undesirabllity.-
By the 30th of June this year's immigration will reach i,000,c00.
This will make for 1903, 1904 and 1905 the enormous total of 2,
669,916. By the time Congress meets in December the indications
are that this number will be extended to 3,000,000. is ex
cessive. It is unjust to our own people, and equally unjust ..to ihe
immigrants themselves. No country can usefully to itself or to* im
migrants receive and care for such an accession to its population.*
When public land, ready to be farmed, was open to settlement
at the small price of Si 25 per acre, our citizens who were driven
out of cities by foreign immigration resorted to the land. For
eigners increased in the large cities, but Americans increased Qn
the farms. The public domain was a safety valve which prevented
the pressure of immigration from being felt. The result was the
rapid settlement of the prairie States of the Middle West, and the
retreat of Americans to the farther West, where they found refuge
upon agricultural and grazing lands. Tliese conditions have no\v
ceased to be. The safety valve is permanently closed. No more:
Government land upon which a home can be made self-supporting-;iu.
one year is to be had for $1 25 per acre. â¢
One million immigrants per year take on the aspect of an in
vading army, landed to fight with our own people for the means of
existence. In our economic system there are supposed to be va
cancies caused by "death and disability for a little more than half a
million people per year in all of thejndustries of the country. That
number of workers in all productive vocations is supplied annually
by the natural increase of our population. That many reach an
nually the working age and equipment, to fill the places vacated by
natural circumstances. It will be-seen that with a half million
Americans reaching industrial maturity and a million immigrants
admitted to. the country, with places for only half a million new
people, we are acquiring an annual surplus population of one mil
lion people. \u0084 .
Tkosp are the hard figures and the cold facts. If vast areas of
tillable land were still open for settlement at $1 25. an acre, this
surplus could be taken up by settlement in rural occupations, by
which life could be well supported. Referring to the experience of
the past, when there was plenty of such land, has caused us to look
with optimism upon the increase in immigration. Therefore some
are still talking and writing about proper distribution of immigrants
being the solution of the problem. As there is no place to which
they may. be distributed, it is no solution at all. If it be said" that
they may become tenant farmers, the answer is that this requires
that they "own the teams, tools and implements required, and they
have no means to acquire this equipment. If they become rural
laborers they simply crowd out those already in the field.
Turn which way one will in search of a solution by which the
gates are left open to ever increasing immigration, and -the problem
remains insoluble. It is further aggravated by the fact that these,
immigrants in five years from the date of their landing become citi
zens. ThisUntensifies the strain upon the country. As total /and
partial indigence increase, ' there is a larger element* that looks to
politics as a means of support. Already we are made familiar with
the spectacle of very rich men who covet public office and honors
achieving their ambition by ostentatious charities to the poor in
their districts. A student of Roman history ;will see the analogy
between such conditions here and the processes by which the Roman
politicians for a century and a half unconsciously' prepared the way
for Caesar. . : .-,
Action upon this question of immigration -has been too long
delayed. What has been done and complacently called a remedy is
no remedy at all. We have proposed to exclude certain^ "undesirable
classes," the physically or morally diseased. But in the face of such
exclusion the total number of immigrants increases until the incre
ment of population is far /beyond our capacity to absorb and utilize.
t)ur great cities are becoming foreign. A majority of the popula
tion of Chicago is foreign, embracing numerous classes and nation
alities, many of them antagonistic to each other, arid alike only in
their low estimate of our institutions. When we received but few
immigrants they learned our language from necessity, imitated our
habits and were Americanized. Now they come in such numbers
that they remain foreign in their language* habits and methods, and
their assimilation is slow, too slow for the good of the country and
*of themselves, yl^ â¢â¢ Vt,'" \u0084.,/.'
The only remedy is a close season, a period of years in which
all nationalities and races are treated alike and excluded alike. It *s
a recognized principle that a nation has full power to protect itself Â»
against immigration, or to help itself by inviting immigration. For
a considerable part of the last century we needed more people and
we invited them. W r e offered citizenship to them on easy terms,
and protected them in it by forcing expatriation treaties upon the
European nations. All that was good policy for that time. It has
served its purpose. There is no more cheap land, our industries
are crowded, our idle people are ' estimated by the million. We
Have people enough for our economic needs. Pauperism and citi
zenship make a bad team to pull a republic through, and easy con
ditions of naturalization should "cease.: % . i : /: s .
The statement that President Roosevelt considers that the sit
uation is acute and must have attention is gratifying to the country.
If he call the attention of Congress to it the people will expect ef
ficient action from that body. It will be opposed by the steamship
j companies which profit by a million steerage passengers a year, but
their interest should not prevail bver the good of the nation and
the real interests of the immigrants ; ir^

A happy old lady In Wisconsin says:
"During the time I was a coffee
firinker I tvas subject to sick head-
aches, recurring, every 2 or 3 weeks,
and sometimes I? sting 2 or 3 days,
totally unfitting me for anything; *-
"To this affliction was added, some
years ago. a trouble with my . heart
that was very painful, accompanied by
a Bmothering sensation and falntness.
"J .would be unable to lie down, but
â¢was compelled to sit gasping . for
breath until I was perfectly exhausted.
'â¢DyspepEla, also, a few years ago
came to make life harder to bear. I
took all sorts of patent medicines as
â¢well as doctor's prescriptions, but none
of them helped me for any length of
time.
"The doctors frequently told me
that coffee was not good for me. but
\u25a0without coffee I felt as if I- had no
bre&kfa*L I finally decided about two
years ago to abandon the use of coffee
entirely, and as I had read a great deal
about -. Postum Food Coffee, I con-
cluded to \u25a0 try that for a breakfast
beverage.
"I liked the taste of tt and was par-
ticularly pleased . to notice - that It did
not "come up* as coffee used 'â¢to. : I
hid only hoped that Postum
Food Coffee vrould help my. digestion,
but I soon found that it: was doing
much, more than that. The bad spells
with my heart grew less and less fre-
quent^ and finally ceased altogether,
and I ha y* not had an attack of sick
headache . for more than a year. My
digestion is good, too, and I am thank-
ful that I am once more a healthy
woman. I know my wonderful restor-
ation to health " came : from ; quitting
coffee and using Postum Food Coffee."
Name given by the Postum Co., Battle
Creek, Mich.
"There's a reason," and it is thb*.-
Coffee has a direct action on the liver
with some . people and . causes partial
consestlon of that organ, preventing
the natural outlet of the secretions.
Then follov.-r sallow skin,
headaches, ronstipation; and finally a
change of the 'blood corpuscles and
nervous prostration.

the general attitude of the purchasing

that â¢ for some unknown reason there

that local houses are not likely to re

.-,.; An . irate woman, a ; well-groomed,
contented-looking young , man 'and 'a
number of detectives, figured in a live
ly though -short-lived 1 case, of rTalleged
forgery yesterday, afternoon. The I prin-,
clpalsÂ« In the case, were -Clarence Dadch
and his wife, both from ("Wisconsin. The
woman tried to . secure a warrant \u25a0. for
her ' husband's arrest on a : charge j* of
forgery, accusing -him : of \u25a0 having/dis
posed: of ? sooo , of; her property by" ille
gal "means. * She ' was unsuccessful in
her Quest, for : the alleged V crime had
beer, committed In Wisconsin,, so: the
local police had no Jurisdiction. The wo
man had neglected to swear; out a .war
rant against her husband' in
'Mrs. Dasch says she will have her re-"
venge, and promises to see her husband
behind the bars at'all hazards.' Accord
ing to her own story, she followed the
man from their home in Centerville,
Wis.. to this city with' the hope of hav
ing him ' convicted ; of a : felony. : But
at. the last moment she encountered in
eurmounta.blo \u25a0 obstacles in the law. .' "
. The case seems~to be shrouded ;in
mystery, and both Mrs. and Air. Dasch
are very reticent regarding It. ' They
would vouchsafe no Information to the
police, the woman \u25a0 even refusing to
leave her address with Captain of De
tectives Burnett.
According to; what little information
the | woman would give out. her hus
band disposed" of " propertyin CCenterr r
vllle. Wis., about two months ago.' Shu
alleges thaUit belonged to .her. and
that Dasch sold ;it /without her knowl
edge or consent for $8000. She charged
him with having forged her name, to
the deeds.: . ' \u25a0 \

, Mrs: Bessie Paxton/ formerly the ; wife

result <of a fall ". when 3 years of age.
Though still a comparatively young wo
man, =. tragedy has : been' written ' in '.the
life of Mrs.' Paxton ''\u25a0 since her son was ; a
babe in arms. X v As . she told the ' story of
how, , the 1 1deals /she? had; builded' when Va
girl crumbled! one by one .before her eyes
and woe ; pressed - ever ; closer, it , was in a
tone of one full of â¢ resentment v that her
cup had ben filled so | full 'of , bitterness;
. "I t \u25a0is terrible,'.' she . said, "to j think j that
the j happy life I ' had J! planned ; for myself

still in a delicate condition through -tue

from the bank and went to "Europe, v His

to pay for the medical attention "\u25a0;neces

asked ray lawyer if Mr. Paxton would not
payjthese bills, so we could live "com
fortably 'on ray f , allowance. He" told jme
that he was! sure Mr. Paxton would "pay
the physicians " : that I cared for J his V own
flesh and blood, but when we communi
cated with" him he absolutely refused to
pay f atdollar. : \ He said he would \ take' the
case to j the. highest court in the land be
fore he .would meet these bills, and he is
keeping his \u25a0 word;
"It is past my comprehension why^ a

It was proved by witnesses that the
steps of the car cleared the buggy by
about seven inches and that.^lf the
plaintiff had kept his body within the
line of the steps he would not have
been Injured. It was also proved that
the company had endeavored by , all
peaceful means in its possession to keep
the men from sitting on the steps, but
that in their hurry to get home they
refused- to wait for sufficient cars -to
come up to carry them. all safely, on
one occasion a conductor being as
saulted because he tried to compel the
men to get off the steps of the car.
After hearing: this evidence the jury
found In favor of the company, co after
this every man that sits on the steps
of a streetcar or allows any portion
of his body to protrude beyond the line
thereof does so at his own peril, for
the company is not bound in law to
protect him.
A verdict has been rendered by a jury
In Judge Graham's court of interest to
every one that rides on streetcars, and
especially to the thousands of em
ployes of the Risdon and Union iron
works, who, in their anxiety to get to
their homes after their day's work is
done, hang to every available projec
tion of the cars upon which they take
passage. The verdict was rendered in
the case of Joseph C. Foster against,
the United Railroads and involved the
liability of the company to protect pas
sengers that allow any portion of their
bodies to protrude beyond the 'line of
the front of the car. After a hearing
of several days the jury found in favor
of the company and declared 'that, so
longr as the steps of a car clear a near
by obstruction or a passing- vehicle the
company is absolved from damages for
any injury that may accrue. to a pas
senger that permits any portion of his
body to protrude beyond this pplnt.
On April IS, 1903, Foster was a pas
senger on one of defendant's cars, go
ing from the Union Iron Works to his
home. . He sat on the steps of the car,
his knees protruding- beyond the line
thereof, and at Seventeenth street, the
car rushed past a buggy standing near
the track. Foster's knees struck it
and he was thrown to the ground, his
right leg being broken above the
ankle. He sued for $15,719 damages,
joining Leo Anthenien, owner of the
kuggy that caused the accident, as Â«k
defendant. He was represented by At
torney Redman, Anthenien by ex-Judge
George H. Bahrs and the United Rail
roads by A. A. Moore.

"The Museum promptly telegraphed to
the bureau in Washington, offering to
place at its disposal its complete service
for the distribution of the requisitions,
nnd to advertise the fact in the daily pa
pers, in order that all merchants would
be accorded equal privileges in bidding
on Philippine supplies. The Museum
p.lfo pointed out that the plan proposed
by the department would not meet with
the approval of local merchants, who
were entitled in every way to the same
consideration as manufacturers or deal
ers in the East.
"Notwithstanding the offer of the . Mv-
Foum to assist the department In a prac
tical way in the distribution of requisi
tions, it received a telegram yesterday
from Colonel Edwards or the Bureau of
Insular Affairs in Washington to the ef
fect that he did not think it advisable
to deviate from the plan suggested In
his letter.
"Judging from the correspondence and
DISCRIMIXATIOX GOES.
"The letter goes on to state that the
department found it necessary to depart
from the method of distribution sug
gested by the Museum because other
Fimilar institutions throughout the
f-ountry could demand and justly ex
pect the same treatment, and that, there
fore, it had been decided to send a copy
of the requisitions to Major Devol, depot
quartermaster at San Francisco, to be
posted in some conspicuous place, so
that every merchant who desires may
have tree access thereto.*
"The only available place for posting
pu^h requisitions is in a narrow street
vhcre there is little possibility of its be
ing seen by the merchants, and In any
rase it is unreasonable to suppose that
those desirous of bidding on such requisi
tions could obtain the necessary- data in
EQCb a manner.
** "After careful consideration of the
question it has been decided to give
every merchant in your city the oppor
tunity of bidding on such requisitions,
nnd it is hoped that the results will Jus
tify the additional clerical labor and in
some instances the delay in executing or
ders which the adoption of this plan will
â¬ ntail.*
"After a further delay a letter was re
ceived from the Bureau of Insular Af
fairs at Washington, in part as follows:
RELCCTAXT TO YIELD.
Some lively correspondence, both by
wire and mail, is passing between Di
rector Evans of the Pacific Commercial
Museum and Colonel Edwards, chief of
the Bureau of Insular Affairs at Wash
ington, D. C. The occasion Is the fail
ure of San FTancisco merchants to re
ceive proper recognition in furnishing
supplies to be used in the Philippines. A
statement regarding the situation is
made by Director Evans, as follows:
"For nearly six months the Pacific
Commercial Museum has devoted special
effort toward having the requisitions for
the purchases by the Philippine Govern
ment distributed among San Francisco
merchants, and has received from time to
time favorable assurances and promises
that such would be done, but 6O far no
satisfactory results have been attained.
As far back as February the Museum
received a communication from the
Bureau of Insular Affairs through Rep
resentative J. C. Xecdham at Washing
ton, Indicating the department's appar
ent sincerity in desiring that San Fran
cisco should have a fair deal in the pur
chase of supplies for the Philippines. A
list was sent to the Museum covering
hundreds of articles representing valua
ble orders that were placed with dealers
end others in the East, and the Museum
undertook to point out to the purchasing
department that a great portion of those
(roods could have been purchased in San
FYancisco to better advantage than in
the East.

was concealed 'behind a curtain.
\ Just ias < Baumbach ; was .f about to ; enter

him a savage blow in the stomach. Baum

of the plan, and many of the sharehold

the paddock association an option on its
holdings commenced a suit against the
directors. A demurrer to the complaint
filed against the Elks was sustained, and
the plaintiffs amended tfirfr complaint.
Ten' days was given the paddock associa

Collins Case Is Continued.
Geoirgre D., Collins, the attorney
charged with bigamy, appeared . before
Judge L<awlor yesterday for arraign
ment, but the case was continued until
2 o'clock Monday. Collins declared that
he had a right to a continuance until
the Grand Jury had completed lta In
vestigations on the case. He asked for
a postponement until next Wednesday
on the ground that his attorney, Bert
Schlesinger. could not be present until
that time. District Attorney Byington
objected strenuously to further delay,
but the court finally granted a continu
ance until Monday. Judge Lawlor has
not yet acted upon Collins' petition to
have the Grand Jury investigation
stopped.
Mrs. Collins Is represented by Hiram
W. Johnson. As he Is known as a de
termined fighter In court it is prob
able that there will be no great delay
in the hearing of the case.
t
Attorney George D. Collins muat
come Into court and establish his claim
that Charlotta. Eugenic Collins is not
his wife arid that he owes her naught.
Charlotta has filed suit against him
for maintenance. She alleges that his
claim that' she is not his wife is-ab
eurd; that she lawfully married him
and that as he is in receipt of. a large
monthly income he should properly
support her, and their three children.
"Your 'petitioner," says Mrs. Collins,
"was married to George D. Collins on
Way 15; ISB9. and three children are
the issue of the union. The eldest of
the children. George, is 15 years of age;
a. daughter. Consuello, is 13, and the
last born. May, is 7. The two, children
first named, says Mrs. Collins, are at
tending school in San Mat eo' and little
May i? at the home of the plaintiff.
"On May 5 last," continues Mrs. Col
lins, "petitioner was deserted by the
defendant, and he has since refused
to contribute toward the support of
his family." If the defendant is com
pelled to pay the expenses of the two
children now attending school. Mrs.
Collins says that $200 a month is suf
ficient for her maintenance, but that
Jf the burden of the support of all of
them Is thrown upon her the court
should give her a monthly allowance
of J3OO
If this proves to be the case the fond-,
est dream of D. H. Harriman will have
been dissipated. It has been his 'ambi
tion to -reduce the total expense 1 of t the
entire railroad organization to a minimum
and one of the first moves in this direc-,
t lon. after the cabinet of directing officials
was created in Chicago, was to consoli
date the offices,. passenger and freight, in
all the bic cities.
In a city where the Union: Pacifio had
the strongest footing; the offices of, the
other roads in the Harriman combine
were merged' into that office, and in other
cities within territory regarded' as be-/
longing to the Oregon : Short. Line or the
Southern Pacific, a similar â¢ move, in
favor of the strongest road, ~ was' made.'
One particular exception was made, 8 and
that was in San Francisco, where the
Union Pacific and Soutnern Pacific : were
allowed to : maintain â¢ separate offices, al
though the offices of the Oregon Railroad
and Navigation Company, were merged
into the office of the; Union Pacific.
In several of the larger, Eastern cities
where these consolidations were /made,
particularly In New. York, the expenses
in the way of salaries; of clerks, .whose
services were dispensed with, were turned
to the credit ; of the Harriman syndicate
and in a very short time footed ;up *
thousands of dollars in the way of saving.
With the reopening of separate \u25a0 offices in
the big cities, which it Ms thought;; will
; have . to follow the reorganization* of i the
four roads, 'Harrlman's: big; pay. roll'': will
again . materially increase and -the . man-,
agement will , soon realize that' ; there ,- are
less resources for, the' accumulation of
the on tne Indebtedness of; thÂ©
companies. ; . , .
Among local -officials of the Southern
Pacific Company the reported plan >of re
organization is hailed ' with i pleasure,' : for
under the former Â£ conditions of \u0084 affairs
there will' be better r opportunity \ for;; ad
vancement and better facilities for: trans
acting business 3 that * Is . now \u25a0\u0084 seriously,
handicapped by ; reason : of f the ; fact I that 1
the bulk .of it has .; to \u25a0 go â¢': through V the
Chicago - offices, '. presides * over by Messrs.
Kruttschnitt, Stubbs ; and \ othjers.' ,*As ;' to
a lawful means for maintaining^ the >' latter,
officials In their present positions;in:con
nection with : the <\ proposed V executive
board^lt was stated yesterday ., by one" of
the representatives /of 1 the '\u25a0'- law .:; depart
ment , of " the ; Southern - Pacific \u25a0 Company
that this can be' easlly/eff ected . by , having
the . board of : directors f of ; each 'â¢ road â¢ sep-;
arately. . authorize 'i Director^ of : : Mainten
ance and Operations Kruttschnitt, 'TTafflo
Director; Stubbs :; and f other, members -of
the : Harriman ; family ? of officials â¢ in ' Chi
cago to^ act for all the roads.
Much serious speculation is being In
dulged In by local railroad officials , as to
what affect the proposed reorganization
of the dependent Harriman lines will have
locally. Advices have been received from
New -York confirming the news published
yesterday that the â¢ Harriman syndicate,
with a view of bringing itself ; within' the
provisions of . the law .as | interpreted in
the merger decision, is planning to re-es
tablish the- four lines ' controlled by that
concern as separate and distinct corpora
tions. The - advices add, however, that it
will be several' months before' the.-un
dertaking can be' carried out in detail. ':
It is the Judgment of the higher [ offi
cials of the Southern Pacific Company in
this city tnat , the separating of the com
panies, will be followed by the re-estab
lishment of separate agencies \u25a0 for each of
the roads in all the big-cities, as was the
prevailing condition ; before' Harriman ef
fected thu syndicate arrangement. -
Assistant District Attorney Charles L.
Weller, who represented the District At
torney before the Grand Jury, in rebuttal
testified that Rebstock had said he want
ed to testify and desired to be sworn.
He did not order the subpena to be is
sued . for Rebstock's attendance. There
was no prosecution against Rebstock, but
simply an Investigation as to frauds at
the polling booth.
Alfred Llllenfeld, who was the. foreman
of the Grand' Jury, testified' that Reb
stock asked to be sworn and to testify
and witness had told him- he need not
answer any question unless he desired to
do so. In. cross-examination Ljllenfeld
denied having a conversation with At
torney Newburgh as to the case at any
time, but said that within the past two
weeks Newburgh had endeavored : to ; get
from him something about the case, but
witness had refused â¢ to talk.
Daniel 1^ Fitzgerald was recalled and
testified that Policeman Luke Livingston,
a" witness for the defense, had said in
his hearing at the booth that he had come
there "to get Hazell," the minion of the
law, using at the same time a filthy,ex
prefcsionj
Court adjourned to Monday at 10 o'clock.
Charles A. McLane, who was temporary
secretary of the. Grand Jury that filed the
Indictment against Rebstock for violation
of the election laws, was called and an
attempt to get him to introduce as evi
dence the memoranda be made showing
the names of the witnesses examined
failed. In answer, to the District" Attor
ney witness said that the matter before
the Grand Jury was whether or ' not
frauds had been committed 'at the Alms
house precinct. There were no proceed
ings against the defendant when he ap
peared before the: Jury and made certain
statements. The conduct of all the offi
cers was being investigated. The indict
ment of the defendant was the result'of
the Investigation. This closed the testi
mony for the defense.
Registrar George R. Adams was called
and corroborated the statement of Reb
stock that he had telephoned for in
structions." \u25a0â¢ v ' I :
While being cross-examined by District
Attorney j Byington Lie ' defendant showed
temper at times ! and made an unfavor
able impression. He admitted that W. H.
Hazell knew all about tne election law.
He denied using vulgar language, but
Hazell had got him excited by making 1 co
many challenges and he had told Ha
zell he could run the booth. .He had
telephoned to the Registrar for instruc
tions.
Judge Lawlor yesterday morning: over
ruled the objection made by District At
torney Byington on Thursday afternoon
to the offer of Joseph Rebstock's counsel
to place the defendant on the stand to
testify as to the evidence he gave before
the Grand Jury- Rebstock thereupon re
lated that he had been asked by Fore
man L.ilsenf eld If -he desired to be sworn
and testify and he had replied in. the- af
firmative. The foreman questioned him
as to who appointed him primary election
inspector in the Almshouse precinct and
as to whether he had refused to admin
ister the oath to voters whose votes had
been challenged. He had answered the
questions and bad denied refusing to ad
minister the oath.
