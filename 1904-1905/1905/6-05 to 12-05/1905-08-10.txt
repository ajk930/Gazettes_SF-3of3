CLEVELAND, Aug. 9.â The World-News to-day says: â¢
"At conferences now taking place at Forest Hill between
John D. Rockefeller and President William R. Harper of Chi
gago University, plans are being formulated for the further,en
dowment of that educational institution by Mr. Rockefeller.
" President and Mrs Harper arrived in Cleveland to-day.
The visit of the Harpers to the home of Mr. Rockefeller is
said to be one of a social nature, but it is known that plans in
volving an outlay of $ 50,000,000 are under consideration by
Mr. Rockefeller, who desires to make the university the greatest
seat ot learning in the world. It is believed final steps in the
matter will have been taken before President Harper leaves, and
his return to Chicago will be followed by the announcement
that the work of enlarging the university will be begun at once."
CHICAGO, Aug. 9. â President' William R. Harper of
the University of Chicago, accompanied by Mrs. Harper, left
last night for Forest Hill, the home of John D! Rockefeller,
near Cleveland, Ohio. The visit, it was announced, was purely
social.
Dr. Harper said that his health was better than it has been
at any time since he was operated upon for cancer and that he
was regaining his strength while teaching two hours daily, besides
attending to his official business of the university.

OMAHA, Aug. 9.â Can a white cook do
better cooking cooped up in a dining-car
kitchen than a black cook?
This is the problem which the Union
Pacific dining-car department has set out
to solve. For some . weeks the s colored
chefs have T been, gradually giving place
to white men, and the* work was com
pleted this week. There is not a single
colored cook on any portion of the Union
Pacific system to-day.
The question, involved is, in a measure,
as to the relative importance of skill in
cooking on the one hand and cleanliness
In methods and habits on the other. It is
admitted that the colored man's cooking
may often be of superior quality, but the
criticism is made that he is slovenly and
less painstaking in his handling of the
food. Consequently . he has had 1 to go
until the road shall have had an oppor
tunity to test the relative merits, of the
white cook. The . experiment is being
watched by the officials : of other rail
roads with interest.
An incipient stampede of colored wait
ers, among whom a report had been cir
culated by a" mlschlef-loving ; employe
that they also were to be replaced by
white men, .has been checked by an offi
cial declaration that the colored waiters
are to be retained. Assurance to this ef
fect was given to a body of fifty 'colored
waiters.
FRESXO, Aug. 9. â When called upon
to-day to swear away the life of her

hand of the court bailiff, ran to her
father and throwing her arms about
his neck clung to him weeping. When
order was finally restored in the court
room the girl was in a condition bor
dering on hysterics and the proceed
ings were postponed.
The pathetic incident occurred at the
preliminary examination of Riggins.
Beside her mother, little Mary was the
only witness to the shooting, but' as
her mother cannot according to law
be compelled to go on the stand against
her husband, the daughter is the only
one who can give direct evidence as
to the shooting. The circumstantial
evidence points strongly to unprovoked
murder, but to make the case complete
the testimony of the little girl must be

CHICAGO, Aug. 9.â The grafting pro
clivities of the ;. American people took
solid root in the days of Washington,
according to Professor Francis W. Shep
ardson of the University of Chicago, who
declares this particular method of acqui
sition is not so bad to-day as it used to
beâ comparatively, of courseâ for . the
country has grown considerably since its
father died.
Professor Shepardson is a recognized
authority on United States history and
is one of the foremost historians of the
country. His views on "Graft," deliv
ered before a gathering of junior and
senior students at the University of Chi
cago, were, at least theoretically, con
vincing.
The present-day grafters did not ap
pear so bad to the students when they
heard from the professor's own lips that
graft, tainted money and vulgar com
mercialism all flourished at the Inception
of this Government.
"Why, Peter Faneuil, who. built Faneuil
Hall, which historians have termed 'the
Cradle of Liberty.' was a liquor dealer
who made his money ;by beating the
Government," the professor solemnly de
clared.
"There is also proof that one of the
signers of the Declaration .of Indepen
dence was indicted for smuggling," the
professor .concluded, impressively.
Historian Says It Was
More Prevalent
Than To-Day.

NEW YORK, Aug. 10.â The Times says:
"W. R. Hearst, whom Tammany does not
intend to renominate as Congressman
from the Eleventh District after the close
of his present term, is preparing to fight
the decree of Charles F. Murphy. Hearst
intends to make a contest for renomina
tion and his campaign managers are al
ready at work. As the first step, Hearst
has completed arrangements to give
every man. woman and child of the dis
trict a free trip to Coney Island, includ
ing admission to most of the Luna Park
shows. Beginning to-day, several thou
sand persons will be carried daily to the
island, the number being so distributed
that there will be a steady stream every
day until early In September.
"Thousands of tickets are being dis
tributed through the district by Hearst's
agents, each being dated so as to pre
vent the crowd from swamping the park
on any single day. The tickets have
coupons good for a trolley ' ride to the
island from Brooklyn "bridge, an arrange
ment having been made with the Brook
lyn Rapid Transit people. By this treat
ment Mr. Hearst hopes that he will have
the inside track a -year, from this fall,
when the district will be called upon to
make a nomination for Congress.
"Mr. Murphy caused the announcement
to be made several weeks ago that
Charles \V. Fornes. president of the
Board of Aldermen and now acting
Mayor, would be. the Democratic nominee
from the Eleventh District In 190& It Is
one of the most ' overwhelmingly Demo
cratic districts In the, city.".

NEW YORK, Aug. 9.â The offlcerg
ebout-the Brooklyn navy yard are great
ly interested just at present in rather
unusual orders having been received by
Lieutenant Charles Nelson, in command
ot the submarine boat Plunger. The or
ders came from the Secretary of the
JCavy and read:
"You are to proceed as soon as possible
to Oyster Bay and report to the Presi
dent."
The general impression is that Mr.
Roosevelt would like very much to take
a dsr> in the submarine if he were not
President, and wants to see anyway what
this crack boat can do. Three years ago
he went to Annapolis, fully expecting to
go down in the Holland, but was per
cuaded not to do so by certain members
of the Cabinet who had accompanied him.
On this particular occasion the President
is reported to have turned on his heel
rather sharply and remarked that some
day he would have a chance.
It will be five days before the Plunger
Trill be in trim to make the run to Oyster
Bay. Three torpedoes are ready to be
placed on the craft and a sample of tar
get practice with these will be given.
Owing to the narrow channel and shal
low water it is out of the question to
dive in Oyster Bay. Instead the plunge
\u25a0will be made outside, In the Sound.
The Piunger is considered the finest
type of our submarine boats.

had been bothered considerably of late
by coyotes killing his chickens and other
farm-yard fowls, and he borrowed a rifle
with which to shoot them.
This morning Mrs. Olson called her
husband's attention to a coyote chasing
a chicken in the yard. Olson got the
rifle and proceeded to throw a shell from
the magazine into the breech block. x.Â»o
trigger was rusty and worked hard. Sud
denly there was an explosion and Mrs.
Olson fell to the floor, the ball having
penetrated her groin. The femoral artery
was severed and she soon bled to death.

"WOOSTER. 0., Aug. 9.â That neither
principal in the Taggart divorce case will
ask for alimony was brought out to-day
in an for the admission of a
statement as to Mrs. Taggarfs finances.
"We have not asked for alimony and
don't expect to," said Attorney Wertz.
"Neither will we." said Attorney
Smizer, "if my client Is granted a di
vorce."
"I attempted to bring about a recon
ciliation between my brother and his wife
without his authority and his knowl
edge," was the statement wrung from
Howard Taggart when he was recalled
to the stand to-day for cross-examina
tion.
Thomas Moraldo, the Filipino valet of
Captain Taggjart. occupied the stand
most of the morning and told in broken
accents of the visits of Lieutenant
Forescua to Mrs. Taggart while Cap
tain Taggart was away on duty at Kan
sas City at the time of the flood. With his
own eyes he saw the lieutenant enter the
house and go upstairs to Mrs. Taggart'*
-roam, where he remained with Mrs. Tag
gart for an hour. - â¢ - \u25a0â¢* - â â Â«
The FlliDlno told of other visits, and
of- drinking bouts In which cocktails,
whisky, wine and beer figured.
SAYS TAGGART WAS SOBER.
The dei>osition of Captain WilJlara B.
Folwell of the Eighteenth Infantry was
taken up this morning- He testified:
"On the evening of June 20. 1903, I was
with Captain Taggart and he was per
fectly sober. I asked him to have a
drink with me before we parted that
night and he declined. Captain Wickham
of the Twelfth Infantry asked me next
day to write a statement of Captain
Taggart's condition as to sobriety on
the preceding evening.
"This was the time at which Taggart
was arrested for alleged intoxication."
Thomas Moraldo then took the stand.
He was with Captain Taggart at Fort
Leavenworth. He. testified that General
Miner called on Mrs. Taggart twice while
the captain was confined in -the hospital.
On one of these visits the general came
alone. Moraldo continued:
"One night about 1 o'clock, while the
captain was in Kansas City. Lieutenant
Fortescue called on Mrs. Taggart. and
Mrs. Taggart came out to the kitchen
and told me I could go to bed. The next
morning Lieutenant Fortescue called on
Mrs. Taggart again, and she received
him in her night dress. The next day he
called again and I let him in. He asked
where Mrs. Taggart was, and I told him
she was upstairs in her room. He went
right upstairs to her room and remained
about an hour with Mrs. Taggart. and
then came downstairs without her and
left the house.
"I frequently saw Mrs. Taggart smoke
cigarettes. One evening Mrs. Taggart en
tertained Mrs. Vose, Mrs. Breese and
three officers at dinner, and they all
drank champagne, whisky and beer."
EXOXEUATES GENERAL MIXER.
On cross-examination the witness said
he presided over the punch bowl at a
cotillon given at Fort Leavenworth In
April, 1903. After the- cotillon broke up
a Jsarty of guests went to the Taggart
home.
"I never saw anything improper take
place between General Miner and Mra.
Taggart," he testified.
Attorney Smlzer attempted time after
time in a rapid fire of questions in his
cross-examination to break down Moral
do's story of how Lieutenant Fortescue
visited Mrs. Taggartgin her bedroom on
a Sunday afternoon while Captain Tag
gart was away on duty at Kansas City.
Moraldo finally remembered that this en
tertainment took place in Captain Tag
gart's "den."
Howard Taggart was then recalled to
the stand for cross-examination by At
torney Smlzer as to his (Howard's) ef
forts to effect a reconciliation between
the captain and his wife.
"You always kissed and embraced your
sister-in-law (Mrs. Taggart) when you
visited her, did you not?" asked Smizer.
The witness admitted that he generally
did.
"After the Rither incident?"
"Yes."
â¢ Mrs. Taggart for the first time durlnj?
the trial broke into tears. At this point
Judge Easton adjourned coort until to
morrow morning.
CHICAGO, Aug. .9. â Is woman respon
sible for what barbarity there is in the
world?
Professor Frederick Starr of the Uni
versity of Chicago says she Is.
In a lecture before Ills class In anthro
pology Professor Starr put himself on
record as believing that in those races in
which children are brought up wholly un
der the direction of the mother there is
more barbarity than in those races where
the young are reared under the guiding
influence of the father.
".A stir was caused in the classroom
when the educator put himself up as a
living example of the truth of what he
said. The students regarded their instruc
tor rather fixedly when he concluded his
remarks by saying:
"I was brought up by my mother, but
if I had been brought up by my father,
instead, I would not have been so bar
barous."
This statement was regarded by some
of the seniors as a sort of apology for the
professor's own eccentricities.
â .professor Starr ,1s known as a rather
peculiar character. He lives entirely
alone, except for the company of a Mexi
can boy, and whenever the vacation pe
riod arrives he hastens away to the
study of some uncivilized race.

PORTSMOUTH, N. H., Aug. 9.â With
the probability that Baron Komura will
to-morrow reveal to the Russian plenipo
tentiaries the terms upon which Japan is
willing to conclude peace, opinion as to
the outcome, among those who are con
gregated hero to watch the proceedings,
has become decidedly pessimistic. This
is due to the growing conviction that
Japan's conditions will not prove as mod
erate as were at one time expected, and,
especially in the matter of Indemnity,
may preclude the possibility of their ac
ceptance by the Russian envoys as a basis
for negotiation.
The firm attitude of Mr. de Witte, in
private conversation, against the payment
of indemnity and the insistent report
emanating from Japanese quarters that a
stiff war contribution, approximating the
cost of the war, variously stated at from
six hundred to eight hundred million dol
lars, constitutes one of Japan's demands,
indicate a wide, if not an irreconcilable
difference , between Japan's irreducible
minimuri^ and what Russia is prepared" to
accept. â¢ .
Upon the , Question of the payment of
a large_'4ndemnity, tner instructions of the
Russian' plenipotentiaries are oeli^ved to
admit of no, concessions, although it is
possible a certain . compensation in kind
might be arranged. For Instance, it is
suggested that, for the relinquishment of
the island of' Saghalien, now potentially
in Japanese hands, the possession of
which by Japan would give her command
of the whole Siberian littoral, 'Russia
could with propriety pay a large sum. â¢'
KOMURA CAUSES A DELAY.
Gloomy forebodings, however, may be
premature at this juncture, as every
thing indicates that the plenipotentiaries
upon both sides are sincerely desirous of
concluding a treaty of peace.
The first meeting of the plenipotentiaries
to-day was of an entirely informal char
acterâso informal, In fact, that Baron
Komura did not bring his letter of cre
dence to the Portsmouth Navy Yard,
whereas Mr. de Witte was armed with
the original document, in Russian, set
ting forth the powers conferred upon him,
and also with a translation of the docu
ment. The latter he read. Baron Komu
ra .was embarrassed and offered to send
back to the hotel" for his communication,
but Mr. de Witte expressed his faith that
the credentials were full and ample, and
It was arranged that the official exchange
of credentials should be made to-morrow.
Later in the afternoon, however, copies
of the credentials were informally ex
changed, in order that they might be
examined before the meeting to-morrow.
It is known that the credentials differ
slightly. In' exactly what respect could
not be ascertained to-night, but the press
Is assured by *both the Japanese and
Russian emissaries that the difference is
not essential and constitutes no obstacle
to the official opening of the negotia
tions. Indeed, the President was officially
informed to-night that the credentiols
were fully ample and satisfactory to
both sides. '.<
PROGRAMME MAPPED OUT.
It was decided to-day to hold two dally
sesions â one in the morning beginning at
9:30 o'clock, and one in the afternoon, be
ginning at 2 o'clock. To avoid delay and
give the plenipotentiaries * and delegates
time for consultations between sessions,
it has been arranged that luncheon shall
be served at the navy yard, and the en
voys upon leaving their quarters In the
morning will not return until the after
noon session ; adjourns. Three secreta
ries for each side will be in attendance
to draw up the protocols of the meetings,
which will be written in both English
and French. The French text,
in cases of j dispute will be accepted in
evidence. - â¢
The official versions of to-day's meeting
given out by each side describe it as "sat
isfactory." Other accounts i indicate that
while. everything passed off amicably con
siderable reserve was displayed upon both
sides. ,;
-Baron Komura, whom Mr. de Witte
had met in St. Petersburg during the
former's service ;.'\u25a0 as Japanese Minister
there, I was pleasantly greeted by .the
chief Russian \u25a0 envoy; in French, but the
Baron was obliged to shake his head and
turn to his secretary, Mr. - Honda, who
explained ; that Baron Komura had for
gotten the- little French he knew while
in St. Petersburg.
While the Russian plenipotentiaries ex
pect the Japanese to present the Japa
nese terms Immediately: upon the official
exchange of . credentials to-morrow, they
admit they ! are in the dark. Baron Ko
mura' and his ; colleagues decline .to give
any intimation of c. their course of pro

have constantly I followed in* all their dip

carefully guarding all their plans regard

PORTSMOUTH, England, Aug." 9.â King
Edward celebrated the anniversary of his
coronation to-day by reviewing the com
bined Frefich and British fleets, aggre
gating some seventy, ships. As a specta
cle the .event was somewhat marred by
gloomy and showery weather, but the
enthusiasm of the crowds was undimin
ished. Masses of people thronged both
snores and the Meet of excursion-boats
was filled to capacity.
The royal yacht Victoria and Albert
weighed anchor .at W:3O o'clock this
morning, and followed by a few privi
leged yachts slowly passed down thÂ« lines
of the fleets. As King Edward approached
the French and British flagships the liring
of a royal salute commenced, and the en
tire combined fleets joined in a salute of
101 guns. His Majesty, wearing the uniform
of an admiral, stood alone on the bridge
of the royal yacht at salute. All the
ships were drr-ssed and' manned and their
bands played "God Save the King.".
The review lasted an hour, .and then
the Victoria and Albert returned to her
moorings. Later the King proceeded to
the battleship Massena, the French flag
ship, where he was the guest of Vice
Admiral Galllard at luncheon.- The Prince
of Wales, and the Duke of Connaught ac
companied his Majesty. . .
The French fleet then weighed anchor
and entered Portsmouth" harbor. As the
Frenchmen passed, in Nelson'.s flagship,
the Victory, from the ptak of which the
tricolor was Hying, saluted them, "in
turn, while bands" massed on her deck
played "The MaraeHlalse." The French
men replied to the salutes of -the Victory.
As soon .ac the . ships were docked the
civir and military ..officials paid- formal
calls, which were "later returned by the
French officers* . .
. Portsmouth is brilliantly decorated and
cheering crowds . greet the visitors on
every, hand.. **" ... v '*â¢
presence of a torpedo-bqat destroy
er flying the German* flag between thÂ©
columns of ships at the conclusion of the
King's review caused comment. It .was
learned, however, that she had come
from Kiel to tow back â Emperor Wil
liam's yacht Meteor, which ! had been un
dergoing reyairs at Portsmouth.
The French officers .wera banqueted at
the naval barracks. Speeches were made
by the Prince of Wales, Admiral Caillard
and Admiral Sir John Flshe'r. /Toast? to
President Loubct and ' the " Prince of
Wales were enthusiastically honored. .
Only six teams entered the competi
tion iind as two of these defaulted
there was little interest shown in the
event. The final match was the best of
the three played, though it was won in
straight sets by Miss Weed and" Miss

price 11 cents per pound and in many
instances even better figures were ob
tained. This year the growers are
making efforts with the association to
have the selling price fixed at 1"Â» cents,
with every hope of securing it because
of the scarcity and probable superiority
of the nuts. Apricots will "also fall

He will serve as a special adviser to
the Russian plenipotentiaries on naval
questions. Commander Roussine was '
accompanied by Alexandre Boutakoff
of the Ruesian Embassy at Washington^
who bears dispatches for the Russian
plenipotentiaries.
When Commander Roussine was ask
ed if Russia was really desirous for
peace ho answered that all nations de
sired poace, and that Russia whs not
unlike the others. Referring to condi
tions in Russia the officer said that al
though the industrial disturbances may
have looked serious from a distance
only a comparatively few of the people i
were involved.
Before I left Rome, the King told- me that
he would s?t aside the total .income derived
from two estates belonging to 'him personally
to help d-fray Uitf â¢ expense of â¢- the \u25a0Intcrna
tlcncl Chamber. The minimum ..income .from
these two properties Is $(iO,COO annually. ThlÂ§
clearly indicates the strong interest the Kliik
is taking In the matter. Now that ! represen
tatives of over forty nations have conferred
upon '.h"? matter, and have unanimously agreed
to urg<i their respective governments : to sup
port the scheme, it only rtrnains for" each
country concerned to take the necessary U-srlsv
Jativ? steps to make the Chamber effective;
This. <-f course, will take Â«gme tkne-r-poÂ«

NEW YORK. Aug. 9.â Frequent out
breaks of rioting, calling for drastic
action by the police-, marked the course
of the strike of the Hebrew bakers'on
the East Side to-day. In an attack on
a bakery in Allen street. -. fifty rioters
broke into the place, completely wreck
ing it, and upset the barrels of flour
and dough in the street. The police
reserves had to be called out before
the rioters could be dispersed.
A committee of 100. sent from strike
headquarters to-night went to a bak
ery in Orchard street io induce non
union workmen to quit, and attacked
the shop. Hearing of the trouble, hun
dreds of strikers rushed rom the meet
ing to the scene of the conflict. One
policeman, who attempted to defend
the non-union men. was severely beat
en, but held his ground until rescued.
The patrol wagon, bringing a squad of
reserves, was furiously assailed by the
mob, who stopped the horses and even
dragged â¢ some of the men from their
seats. The rest quickly charged the
mob through a rain of bottles and
brinks that poured from roofs and win
dows. After ten minutes of hard fight
ing- the mob was dispersed.
. At many points on the East Side
wagons carrying bread were attacked,
the drivers beaten and the contents
thrown into the street. Many women
participated in these attacks. Accord
ing to the strikers, the loaves thus dÂ«r
stroyed were supplied from shops in
Philadelphia and other nearby towns. .
Throughout the whole lower .East
Side a bread famine was general among
the Hebrews, for the people not only
refused to eat any but Kosher bread,
but appeared to be bent on destroying 1
all the bread of that character which
they could Jay their hands on.
Governor Johnston was prompted to j
take this action by numerous letters he
received from commerciav organisations
and citiÂ«ens ; of the State urging him to
take "some measures to end the struggle.
The Governor' stated that some of the let
ters he had received declared that busi

in the situation to-day. Both sides are
still claiming that conditions are improv

in a statement issued to-day, said that a.s
far as the Great Northern was concerned,
the strike is a closed incident. The North
ern Pacific officials did not give ou,t any
official statement to-day, saving that con
ditions had so improved that there was
no longer a necessity for a dally bulletin.
On the other hand, officials at strike
headquarters say that, with very few ex
ceptions, their, men are standing loyally
by their officers. .

"Yellow fever exists now in Louisi
ana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida and
the republic of Mexico. Texas Is sand
wiched between the infected districts
with very little hope of escaping: in
vasion by the scourge with the long
summer before us. I would most cer
tainly insist that there be no mobiliza
tion of citizens or soldiers at this time,
as any excitement might cause a gen
eral stampede and a general quaran
tine that would tie up the entire rail
road ser\-ice of the State."
The State health officer has also
called upon the Governor to hold the
entire State ranger force in reserve,
subject to his orders, as he may need it
at any time to control the quarantine

COLOX, Aug. 9^â Before sailing for
the United States on the steamship
Mexico last evening, Theodore P.
Shonts, chairman of the, Panama Canal
Commission, gave a hearing to the
steamship agents, who urged him to
use his best efforts to secure better
docking facilities here. Superintend
ent H. G. Prescott. representing the
Panama Railroad, and Mr. Garland of
the Pacific Mail Steamship Company
also were present at the conference.
After listening to the statement of
the agents relative to the detention of
steamships, Mr. Shonts expressed his
regret at the present inadequate dock
accommodations, which he confessed
was primarily due to the. rilling of
large orders for canal purposes. He
said that an adequate number of docks
would be built and the proper housing
of the canal employes, together with
modern sanitary, arrangements, would
all be attended to. He promised that
within the next thirty days he would
have the pier at' Cristobal, on which
work was already begun, sufficiently
enlarged to dock four steamships. He
could see no reason why steamships the
size of the Mexico, which was recently
detained for several days in the stream,
should not then be able to dock at this
place and. enter the mouth of the canal.
In conclusion he suggested that the
agents have another meeting anjj dis
cuss the matter more fully with Chief
Engineer Stevens, who, he had no
doubt, would do his utmost to relieve
the congested condition of affairs.
Commissioner O. If. Ernest also was
a passenger on the steamship Mexico.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 9. â In a manner
intended not to arouse the combative
ness of inhabitants of cities in the yel
low fever districts where local quaran
tines have been raised the Postofflce
Department is instructing railroads
having mall carrying contracts that it
expects the Government pouches to be
moved with as much dispatch as pos
sible. In some portions of Louisiana,
Mississippi and Texas passenger trains
are not permitted to stop, and in some
few instances the service has been dis
continued by the railroads.
Officials of the Postofflce Department
do not consider the interference with
this service a sufficient excuse by the
railroads for the failure to carry the
mails. The railroads have been given
to understand that the department ex
pects the mails to be moved in some
manner â if not on passenger trains,
then on freight, or if not on freights,
on hand cars or by any other means
that can be adopted. The Instructions
sent out are not meant to encourage
the railroads to enter into conflict with
authorities of towns that have raised
quarantine. \u25a0

DISTINGUISHED PRELATE WHO SUCCUMBED TO YELLOW FEVER IN NEW

HE HAD PLANNED TO ASSIST IN STAMPING OUT THE DISEASE.
During his stay in New Orleans he has

high ability and exceptional intellectual
attainments. He was fond of social life
end was a constant entertainer, drawing
to h!s home here the most representa
tive people in the social and intellectual
UÂ£* in the city.
During his stay in Manila he was
thrown constantly into contact with Sec
retary Taft. then the Governor of the
ir-lands. and they became warm personal
friends.* When Secretary. Taft came
through New Orleans early in the year
m his way to Panama the Archbishop
attended the banquet given to him and
subsequently entertained the Secretary
et a formal function in the archepiscopal
chalice. Three years ago Archbishop
Chapelle was relieved of the responsibil
ity of his mission to the Philippines, but
continued his jurisdiction over Cuba and
Porto Rico. He made frequent visits to
both islands and was constantly in touch
with all the work of his vast diocese.
in 1S?1 Archbishop Chapelle was made
Bishop Coadjutor of Santa Fe, and be
came Bishop of that diocese in 1834. Three
years later, on the death of Archbishop
Jar.ssens, he was named as Archbishop
of New Orleans. The year following,
after the Spanish-American war, he was
appointed by the Pope as apostolic dele
pate to Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philip
pines. He went to the Philippines and
spent much time there* in connection with
the conditions growing out of the change
of sovereignty in the islands. He took
tip the cause of the friars, and though
his work was most difficult the results
achieved resulted in the approval of the
Vatican.
Although the venerable prelate was a
subject of scientific treatment and had
the most assiduous attention, his phy
sique counted heavily against him in the
opinion of both the laity and the physi
cians, while his fatigued condition on his
return from a particularly Irksome trip
throug-h the country also was against
him. His death, therefore, while gener-
E-Jly deplored. Is not considered to nega
tive the opinion of the medical fraternity
that with good care and proper treat
ment the mortality is unlikely to be
heavy during the present visitation.
What has been considered remarkable is
that the Archbishop should have con
tracted the disease here so quickly after

L- Chajelle of the Diocese of Louisiana.
The end came at 12:50 p. m. The news
of the Archbishop's death created a pro
found shock. Monsignor Chapelle was
taken 111 with yellow fever on Friday.
He had returned to the city three days
before, having just completed a tour of
Louisiana and had announced his * in
tention of helping to stamp out the fever.
T..e Archbishop, however, left his house
only upon one occasion before he was
taken sick. On Friday he complained of
the symptoms which are the forerunner
of yellow fever. Dr. Larue. the Arch
bisnop's physician, on Friday diagnosed
the case as one of genuine yellow fever.
From the first he was apprehensive as
to results.
NOBLE CAREER AT END
He could only conjecture the results if
the boycott were disregarded by the
Americans, but considered the movement
most serious. He trusted that it would
soon be rendered superfluous by a sat
isfactory settlement of the complaint. He
said he had been credited with direct
ing the movement, but indignantly repudi
ated the suggestion. He suggested that
an educational test was the most effect
ive means to prevent the ingress' of
coolies.
Regarding thÂ» desirablliy of^ Chinese, la -
bcr in the Far East, "\Vu Ting-Fang in
stanced the prosperity of Singapore. He
greatly, regretted' the boycott- against
American goods as. it may possibly
estrange the igood will of the Ameri
cans, which is highly prized. Apparently,
however, the Chinese classes most con
cerned, considering the prospects remote'
for a solution of ..the. difficulty, have de
cided that a boycott is the only means
of ventilating- the question. Wu Ting-
Fang pointed out that the boycott, though
thoroughly organized .by the best and
most representative Chinese, was thor
oughly pacific and was not directed
against persons and property. He ex
pressed surprise, at the depth of feeling
manifested not only by the mercantile
classes, but by students and even wo
men. This expression of public senti
ment indicates extraordinary progress in
the direction of growth of real national
ity.
Wu Ting-Fang admitted that European
immigrants were not allowed representa
tion or appeal during their examination,
but rejected the argument because the
Chinese art treated in an entirely dif
ferent manner' He said that China agreed
to the exclusion of coolies, but urged as
the main pointa of her contention that
the better class of Chinese be treated on
an equal footing with other aliens; be
given the right to retain- counsel, the
right to appeal if necessary: and that
coolies be admitted to Hawaii. This last
he regarded as the most important. Ha
waii, he saiil. requires laborers -badly
and since the Chinese have been excluded
the industries of the islands have suf
fered. The Chinese, he said, do not com
pete with American labor. The Philip
pines have long been the natural field for
Chinese industry, said Wu. The applica
tion of the exclusion act to the Philippines
by General Otis was without America's
prior approval- and jt is generally admit
ted he believes it. was uncalled for. (
SENTIMENT DEEP ROOTED. -
Moreover, ahe Chinese is not allowed to
retain the* services of any one to protect
his interests, and if the immigration au
thorities decide,, adversely in his case
there is no appeal. That these grievances
are' well tounded, said Wu, is demon
strated by President Roosevelt's stringent
order that courtesy be -shown the Chi
nese by the authorities under pain of dis
missal. The President's action in the case
of the King family practically admits
the existence of real grievances, it was
argued.
Hawaii the real issue.
The Chinese Government, he said,
agreed to the exclusion of coolies I from
the United States and this point presented
I no difficulty, but the existing regulations
I pressed hard on other classes. For in
j stance, merchants and travelers, while
nominally free to enter the United States,
are forced to undergo an examination
I which. pcssibly is necessary, 'but which is
generally rendered very objectionable on
account of the manner of its enforce
ment. For example, a Chinese of the
superior class arriving at San Francisco
was detained by the authorities while
his credentials were being examined.
This detention frequently involves his
consorting with low class coolies in a
common shed. He is thus unable to com
municate with his friends and is sub
jected to inconvenience and indignities to
which the mealiest Aineiicjyi would re
fuse to submit.
PEICIN, Aug. 9.-Wu Ting-Fang, former
Chinese Minister at Washington, and now
vice president of the Chinese' Board' of
Foreign Affairs, was interviewed this
afternoon in regard to the proposed new
treaty with the United States. He said
that the expiring convention* was unsatis
factory from the Chinese standpoint and
hence they jdesired its revision.

SANTA FE,- N. M.. Aug. 9.-The third
attempt in recent months to kidnap
Miguel A. Otero. the son of Governor
Otero of New Mexico, has been defeat
ed by the temporary absence of the boy
from the summer home of Mrs." W. B.
Chllders, where he had been a guest. Six
heavily armed men rode up to the
Childers cottage on the -Upper Pecos
River yesterday and demanded the boy.
Mrs. Chllders, who was alone with the
servants, informed the men that young
Otero was not on the premises, but they
searched the buildings and then rode
away. The boy was with his uncle on
a fishing trip at the time.
Deputy Sheriff Charles Closson and a
posse were immediately sent to the camp
in the mountains where the young man
was staying and returned here with him,
closely guarding against a surprise by
the would-be kidnapers while en route.
While at the camp they learned that
members of the band had been to the
camp, but young Otero was away fishing
and- thereby escaped them.
It is believed the leader of the band
is an ex-convict lately pardoned by Gov
ernor Otero. He was recently seen talk
ing to other ex-convlcts and was heard
to remark: "If we can only get the boy
into the mountains the eld man will pay
a princely ransom for his recovery."
VICTORIA, B. C. Aug. 9.â The sensa
tional discovery was made to-day that
the smuggling of general goods from
United States points to British Columbia
is going on- In wholesale fashion along
the border line of the State of Washing
ton. Several of the leading wholesale
houses in this city have aent a petition
to the Board of Trade, asftlng that the
matter be considered and some action
suggested.
In the early days of the district, when
transporation facilities were not as con
venient as at present, the practice ot buy-
Ing in the towns just to tae south of the
boundary line was begun, but with thÂ»
development of traffic the trade has not
been discontinued.
There is a large population between the
line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, ex
tending from Mission Junction to Sumaa
and the Chllllwack Valley, and the com
munication to the Board of Trade states
that hardly an order for goods is re
ceived here. The smuggling Is particu
larly prevalent in the Abt>ottsford sec
tion, where the distance to the border is
short. The roads are good, and whole
wagonload3 of groceries, provisions, etc.,
are brought in.
The complaint is made at a convenient
time, as at present the head officials of
the Customs Department of Canada are
in the city. These are John McDougal.
Commissioner, and S. W. McMlchael.
Chief Inspector. It is likely that prompt
action will be taken by the officers of the
Board of Trade.

ALBANY, N. V., Aug. 9.â This morning
found two hundred men still toiling over
the wreck of the John G. Meyers Com
pany department store, where twenty
four hours before occurred ' the saddest
catastrophe in the history of old Albany.
Twelve dead bodies, many of them man
gled beyond recognition, have been taken
from the ruins thus far and one woman
died after being carried to the hospital.
The list of known dead, which last night
numbered only five, has been more than
doubled by the addition of the following,
all employes: Mary McAver, died at hos
pital; Anna Cashman. Theresa Spannbau
er, Etta Sprinks, Grace Berner. Helen
Malone, John E. Powers, cash boy.
In addition to these it is almost certain
that fifteen or twenty bodies still re
main in the twisted mass of beams, wires^
plaster, brick and lath, which was once'
the \u25a0 main portion of one of the city's
largest, stores. . -
A day's work by skilled hands from the
wrecking crew of the New York Central
and Deleware.. and Hudson railroads has
resulted in raising barely half the debris.
! Shortly after daybreak , the searchers
found the body of Miss Helen Malone, a
young girl who shared trie cashier's gal
lery on the main floor with Anna Whit
btck, Minnie Bullman and Alice. Sharp,
and was crushed beneath the same gird
ers that killed her three companions.
Shortly after 10 o'clock' the thirteenth
body was found and identified as that
of Miss ' Winifred Kelly, by her father,
who . had watched by the wreckage - all
night:
The injured in the hospital are doing
well with two exceptions. . Miss Ella
Donohue, one of the first survivors to be
taken out of the wreck, has her spine
fractured and cannot live. Mrs. Borst
of Windom. Minn., who was one of the
few shoppers injured, is also reported to
be in a critical condition. She has been
visiting Mrs. Richard W. Brass, wife of
a weli known attorney. The two women
were out on an early shopping tour.
An investigation will be begun as soon
as the work of rescue' is over. The work
under way when the building collapsed
was in charge of Contractor John Byer
Jr. . Of the thirty-one men employed by
him on the*. building; every one escaped.
In view of the fact that nearly all of
them rrere in or under the basement in
the very center of the- structure, their
escape Is almost miraculous.
RENO, Aug. 9.â Matt Lynch, who had
been In this city for several weeks, com
mitted suicide in his room in the Tre
mont Hotel this morning by taking an
overdose of morphine. He was arrested
Tuesday night for being disorderly, but
â¢was turned loose by the Chief, after the
latter had discovered that the prisoner
was a morphine fiend and was only under
the influence of the drug.
Lynch at that time told the Chief that
he would commit suicide, as he could not
stop the use of the drug and was a dis
grace to his ramily. who reside In San
Francisco. A few hours later he was
found dead. He told the Chief of Police
before leaving the jail that his parents
and himself were well known in San
Francisco, and that for a number of
months he conducted a drus store in that
city. . .

Millionaire Weyerlianser Has
Agents Here Negotiating
for a Valuable Section
Frederick Weyerhauser of Minneapolis,
known throughout the â¢ country as the
Rockef filer of the timber world, is nego
tiating for a vast tract -of valuable tim
ber situated in Northern California and
Southern Oregon. Two of the Weyer
hauser representatives, R. L. McCormick
of Tacoma, who is treasurer of the big
Minneapolis lumber company, in which
he owns a large block of stock, and
George S. Long, Pacific Coast manager of
the â¢ concern, have been at the Palace
Hotel for several days conferring with
Hervey Lindley of Klamathon, George
Slasonof Los Angeles and- others who
are interested in varions portions of, the
timber tract that Weyerhauser is after.
In all Weyerhauser has under consider
ation between 45,000 and , 60,000 acres,
which are said to contain" one of the
most valuable tracts of white pine and
sugar pine in California or Oregon. Tim
ber cruisers have already made a thor
ough' inspection of the property wanted
by Weyerhauser and have reported in
favor of the deal. As yet. however, the
parties interested have not been able to
arrive at a^ satisfactory price for, the
land, and it is in connection with, this de
tail - of , the "negotiations that the repre
sentatives' >' of -Frederick Weyerhauser
came to this city.
Included' in the tract Js the property of
the Klariiath Lake Railroad . Company, of
which -.He'ryey. Is' president, and
which owns thirty, miles "of line extending
from Pokegama.'Or.j southward "to Laird,
where it connects wfth the Southern Pa

property.

AFTER A BIG
TIMBER TRACT
Senator Welch had a stenographer
with him when he challenged the votes
of the hospital' inmates and has com
plete evidence against Kenny. It was
thought that he would present this to
the Grand Jury or the District Attor
ney yesterday, but he has decided to
let the matter drop.
No one as yet has come forward with
evidence concerning alleged frAuds in
the Almhouse precinct. Neither Fore
man Andrews nor- District Attorney
Byington has received any complaints
regarding the affair. It seems that
those who were working for clean poli
tics are satisfied with their sweeping
victory and the sentiment seems to be
not to press charges against the graft
ers, as their shady work proved fruit-
As yet the 'Grand Jury has received
no Information regarding election
frauds practiced at the primary elec
tion. It was thought that Senator
Richard Welch would hand over to
Foreman Andrews evidence against
John Kenny, who- acted as Inspector in
the City and County Hospital Precinct,
where the indigent sick were voted,
contrary to the advice of the District
Attorney, but Welch announced yester
day that he had no intention of prose
cuting Kenny.
"Kenny was at one time a friend
of mine," said Welch. "What he did
yesterday was done through ignorance,
not with any criminal intent. The
only thing that Kenny could be in
dicted for is stupidity."

of the aristocratic company he brought
together in the late Northern Securi
ties Company. The list of stockholders
filed at Trenton, in connection With the
liquidation reads like pages*, from
Burke, and even the Almanach de
Gotha has been drawn upon.
' The Duke of Connaught, brother of
King Edward and son of Queen Vic
toria, appears as the owner of 1257
shares, and his wife, the Duchess, as
the owner of 5711 shares. Reckoning
these 6998 shares at 160 the' Con
naughts had the neat sum of J1.119.650
invcÃted in Northern Securities. It is
not strange that their royal highnesses
became a little anxious while the pay-
Ing of dividends was enjoined, a." state
which, we- are told, was happily re
lieved by Mr. Hill advancing the, divi
dends out of his own pocket.

LEWIS NAMED
FOR GOVERNOR
According to a veteran New York de
tective who has Just gone on the retired
list after nearly for\y years of service,
the trust principle or combination of in
terests does not .prevail among criminals.
In the recital of his experiences, which
he has imparted to an interviewer, it is
set forth that "gangs" are by no means
as common to-day as they were when he
first took to sleuthing, and that "pals"
and "partners" are growing few. The
modern criminal prefers to do his work
alone. He is the independent laborer, the
individual operator, and having no asso
ciates runs less danger, for tbe saying
about honor among thieves has -little to
rest on. "Pals" are easily "pumped"
when they do not anticipate the need of
the process by "squealing." Another thing
that the. v retired detective has noted is
that criminals are better educated now
than they were in .the early '70s. , He
thinks that crimes which demand in the
perpetrator a fair education and consid
erable knowledge of the ways of finance
and the ways of the world are more com
mon than they were. â Boston Herald. .

The Call is requested to announce that
It is perfectly safe for Julius Kahn, the
genial Congressman. Fourth District, to
return to the city from his summer va
cation and extend a glad hand to his
admiring constituents. The primary
election took place last TuesJay and the
result is widely known. Charms of met
ropolitan life are alluring.
caucus will dispel the illusion of the
grafters that the league delegations are
not solid against Ruef
Men engaged In the retail liquor traffic
have recently increased their stock of
knowledge. The increase was acquired
in the hard school of experience, where
many lessons of great value in life are
taught. The dealers are a little short
on cash, owing* to exorbitant assessments
levied on the saloon business by the
grafters' alliance, but they are long on
wisdom. When the next election comes
around they will stand by their politi
cal principles and put aside the fear of
losing license to do business.
There will be a session of the execu
tive committee of the San Francisco Re
publican League to-night or to-morrow
evening. Doubtless plans for a caucus
of the majority will be discussed The
CAL'CUS OF MAJORITY.
No one is slated to head the Republi
can ticket. Many worthy citizens believe
that H. D. Lovtland ought to be nom
inated for Mayor. He is able and popu
lar. Others hold that General C. A.
Woodruff would be an ideal candidate.
He is an army officer on the retired list
and the Supreme Court has yet to de
cide whether an army officer is eligible
to the office of Mayor. General Woodruff
is known as a 'capable, energetic and
resolute man. John Lackmann is a con
servative man with a strong following in
the community. The grafters are very
bitter against him. Many leading citi
zens entertain the hope that former Su
perior Judge Charles W. Slack may be
persuaded to allow his name to be pre
sented to the Republican convention
when nominations for Mayor are con
sidered. He is regarded as an ideal citi
ren of high character and fine attain
ments.
The notion is absurd that the league
delegations will be torn asunder be
cause some particular seeker of emolu
ment wants the nomination for Sheriff
end somebody else wants indorsement
lor Supervisor. All indications point
to a remarkable cohesion of the league
delegations on the proposition to put
In thÂ«; field a man for Mayor who Will
enlist the support and confidence of the
great body of intelligent, progressive
men comprising what is known as the
g-ood citizenship of San Francisco.
Contests for subordinate places on the
ticket can remain in abeyance until the
question of the Mayoralty nomination
is disposed of. The eager aspirant for
any office who is found in the attitude
of seeking the favor of Ruef in the Re
publican convention will get recogni
tion where the poultry gets the ax.
The battle of last Tuesday made the
simple truth clear to the dulled poli
tician that the Republicans of the city
can win without Ruef and cannot win
with him.
LEAGUE FORCES SOLID.
The Lynch-Kelly delegraton of the
Twenty-eighth Assembly District is al
ready out of line with the minority and
practically in the camp of the majority.
The Ruef forces in the Forty-fourth
and in several districts south of Mar
ket street do hot enjoy the prospect of
arraying themselves with the losers.
Inclination to jump into the league
band wagon is keenly manifested by
quite a number of Ruefters. When the
convention meets to organize the
strength of the minority will hardly
exceed 100 delegates. The lesson is
plain that the grafters lost and the
league won. The subservient police
man's stock of common intelligence is
equal to the comprehension of that fact.
When the reports reached the voting
booths Tuesday night at 9 o'clock that
the league had carried the election, in-
Bolent members of the police force at
once became civil and obliging. They
declined to jpstle and bullyrag decent
citizens at the behest of Ruefs elec
tion officers. The firemen, janitors, po
licemen and the whole array of munici
pal attaches study the political skies
and many of them recognize in the ris
ing sun the likeness of some one. other
than Schmltz.
Agrents of the grafters' alliance are
circulating the report that the minority
of the Republican convention, under
the direction of Ruef, will outgeneral
the leag-ue forces and gain by political
manipulation the ground that the
grafters lost In Tuesday's battle at the
primary polls. This sort of blustering
talk by the ugly losers shows that
Ruef is not well Informed concerning
the character of the Republican League
delegations. Moreover, the facts jus
tify the assertion that the minority is
"growing smaller by degrees and beau
tifully less," while the majority column
Is receiving reinforcement.
Caucus May Be Called
to Solidly Cement
the Forces.
Since the -morning, on which the mur
der occurred the Sheriff and his deputies
have been working night and day on the
case and they now feel that their labors
have been amply rewarded. '"
On July 25 xa . detective . from San
Francisco arrived here and took up the
investigation in conjunction with the
Sheriff's office. The clews secured by the
local officers were followed by him and
sufficient .evidence was secured to war

LODI, Aug. . 9.â Because his wife re
fused him money; with which to purchase
liquor; William Willis, aged fifty years,
shotand wounded her, to-day and then
turned tha weapqn upon himself, firing
fcwo shots, "one of which shattered his
skull 'and caused instant death. Mrs.
Willis is seriously wounded and may not
recover." ' â¢ ;
'* The tragedy occurred on the Smith
ranch, seven miles east of Lodi.
-Willis was a ranch hand and had been
employed on various ranches about Lodi
for the "past twenty, years. He was ad
dicted to drink and was very quarrel
some. An adopted daughter of the couple,
Jennie, aged about fifteen years, nar
rowly escaped being shot by the Irate
husband, for he would have shot her
also had not the mother sent the child
away. Previous jto the shooting Willis
had been on a prolonged spree. He spent
$175 for -whisky and it -was tha refusal
of his wife to give him .more money
that caused the double shooting.
.At a meeting of the Board of Con
trol of the Bennington Memorial Asso
ciation to-day an advisory 'board con
taining the names of citizens prominent

usual condition at sea was to-day re
ported by Captain Goodwin of , the ship
Dlrigo, which arrived, at the Spreckels
sugar refinery from Honolulu with a
cargo of raw sugar. ' The Dlrigo, - ac
cording to Captain Goodwin, practically
drifted from Honolulu to the Delaware
Breakwater, a distance of 14,000 miles.
The run required 156 days.
On several days the Dirigo, which Is
one of the fastest clipper, ships afloat,
made only fifty miles. The weather in
both tho Atlantic and , Pacific oceans
was calm and sultry, with Incessant
rains and little cloudbursts, delaying
the big ship. Only two vessels were
seen until the Dirigo approched land.-

There were shots fired, but I did not see
Bowen have a gun. I was too frightened
to look after I saw the blood streaming
from Will's face. Â«
"If Will had not been shot I fear that
Bowen would now be the dead man."
The Coroner's Jury was out half an
hour and returned the following verdict:
"We, the Jury, find that the said W. W.
Stephenson, age about thirty-five years,
nativity California, occupation rancher,
residence Washoe, Nevada, came to his
death in the city and county of San
Francisco at 1015% Larkin street, August
6, from wounds from shots fired by Chil

. Attorney "Walter Gallagher, who made
an unsuccessful attempt to secure the
$123 found In the dead man's pockets to
defend the murderer, asked the witness
a few questions, but did not volunteer to
placo his client. Bowen, on the stand.
The following statement was made be
fore the Jury by Mrs. Stephenson:
"W. W. Stephenson and I were mar
ried eight years ago In Susanville, Las
een County, and we moved to Nevada,
where we had lived up to the time of
my coming to San Francisco. I met
Bowen last December, when he was
working on our ranch and we grew Inti
mate In a short while. My husband sus
pected that we were too friendly, but he
did not accuse me until on his return
from a trip to Virginia City several
months ago. Then he came to me and
said Bowen would have to leave the
ranch because his actions â¢were causing
talk among the neighbors. Bowen then
went to the farm of a Mr. \ Douglas to
work and communicated with me by
mail. I visited him once after he moved
on a little ranch he owned some three
miles from the one my husband rented.
"Acting on medical advice, I prepared
to come to San Francisco for treatment.
"Will intended to accompany me,. but was
deterred on account ota lack of funds. By
a prearraneement, Bowen met me' at
Boca, a station in Xevada, and together
we came to San Francisco.'
COMES TO SAA* FRAACISCO.
Mra. Cr. Beck, the landlady, told of the
â¢vents on the morning of the murder,
corroborating the testimony of the others
en the stand.
Detectives Matheson end Mulcahy tes
tified as to the actions of Bowen and the
woman when these officers arrived at the
house after the murder. Matheson swore
that the dead man had his hand Inside bis
Inside coat pocket and a pistol was re
moved from it when searched. "He was
lying full length on the floor of the
room," eald Matheson, "as though death
had been instantaineous, with two wounds
la bis head, inflicted at close range."
Dr. Bacigalupi told how the death was
caused. The first wound was not In
stantly fatal, he said,* and the second
must have been the wound from which
be died.
From thÂ© other witnesses examined it
was learaerd that Stephenson came to
San Francisco to satisfy bis suspicions
about hla wife's unfaithfulness and. If
possible, to drag her from Bowen'e tempt
ing presence. Oficer O'Sullivan, who was
called to the house by the son of the
landlady, reviewed the finding of the un
true wife and murderer In the room and
gave an account of their actions.
Hardly had tho offlceT finished the reci
tal of the details when Mrs. Stephenson
collapsed and tiad to be removed from the
room. It was some little time before ehe
was able to again listen to the examina
tion of 'witnesses. *
REACHES FOR REVOLVER.
Mrs. Stephenson said Bowen shot her
husband as- he was entering the room
without giving him a chance to defend his
life. She claimed Stephenson had once
threatened the lives of herself and Bowen
if evtjr he caught them together and this
be the defense that Bowen will urge

Says Problem, Has Become
Serious One as Affecting
Domestic Life of People
NEW YORK, Aug. 9. â Stirred by the
presence in his courtroom of 100 wom
en, followed by a mob of children, each
woman demanding a warrant for the
husband whom she charged with de
sertion and non-support, Magistrate
Pool-yesterday declared that wife de
sertion is one of the most serious
menaces to domestic life that now con
fronts \ New York. After hearing the
charges the Magistrate Issued twenty
warrants \u25a0 and turned the remaining:
cases over to the court officers for im
mediate i investigation. Later, In dis
cussing the problem with a reporter,
the Magistrate said:
'â¢The large number of cases that are
coming before Magistrates In the police
courts show the grave nature of the
problem that the lawmakers must face.
When a man' tires of a wife, or is at
tracted by a pretty face, all that he
has to do is to refuse to support his
wife, and' then when she has him sum
moned before me he can, give a bond
for the payment b'f a weekly sum and
go free of Interference from the woman
or from the law. I am glad to say
that in the largest number of cases
that appear before me the husband is
of foreign' birth.
"A serious side to the problem is that
women appeal to the police court for
aid only when they have exhausted
every other means of bringing the hus
band back to them.
â¢ ."When. a woman appeals to me for
aid I can only summon the husband and
force him to give bond for the payment
of a stated. sum each week. If he re
fuses . I can send him to the work
house. Many prefer going to the work
house to . paying their wives anything
at all."'
A â¢ probation - ofHcer in Magistrate
Pool's court said he had given the
question of wife abandonment careful
study and that such cases are con
stantly increasing in number in this
city. He asserted that family inter
ference and troublesome relatives were
the two causes largely responsible.
WAR AMONG OYSTER
MEN IN NEW YORK
Encroachments of the Trust
Opposed by Independent
Fishermen.
NEW YORK, Aug. 9.â An oyster war
of great magnitude. has '_ broken piit,be
tween independent fishermen in New
York waters and a combination of
wealthy oyster men who. It is declared,
not only control the planted beds of the
State,': but are now trying to. get hold
of those of natural growth. The fisher
men have* organized a protective asso
ciation and began proceedings yester
day to prevent the lease or sale at
nominal figures of any oyster or clam
beds of natural growth to the members
of the alleged trust. â¢
In 1887 the Legislature passed a law
for the purpose of stimulating the cul
tivation of oysters, -providing for the
sale of all available lands under water
fit for shell fish . cultivation, but ex
pressly preserving for the State all the
natural beds. It is now alleged by the
small fishermen that the big planters,
for a nominal sum of 25 cents an acre,
acquired all 'the available lands under
water near this city and began to en
croach upon the natural beds.

OAKLAND, Aug. 9. â Hidden' in a
tangle of bushes less than fifty feet
from the spot where- Thomas W. Cook
jvas beaten to death two 'weeks ago, a
black mask such as is commonly worn
by footpads was found yesterday by
eight year old .Christopher Elfele, the
son of Christopher Eifele, who lives on
the corner of the old county road and
Fruitvale avenue. \u25a0\u25a0 .- â¢
, .The boy was playing Avith several
others* and in running through the
brush he. discovered the mask tangled
in the branches of a bush. The mask
forms one of the strongest . links of
evidence so far Secured against John
Schneider, who with George Blaker
and Percy Pembroke has; been charged
with the murder of Cook, for it was
positively identified to-day by James
Crowhurst, the leader of 'the gang of
desp.erate young criminals, as one that
he had given "to Schneider a few days
before^ Cook was held ; up. Crowhurst
was not informed that the, mask had
been found near the scene^ of the
crime, but was simply asked" if he had
ever seen the article and he at once
said that he had made the mask and
had afterward given it to Schneider.
"When Chris Eifele found the . mask,
he took it at once to' his father, who
later turned it over to Constable Tom
Carroll, and it was by the latter that
the identification was made, complete.
The finding of the mask at this time
is most Important, as, with the testi
mony of Crowhurst it connects Schnei
der directly with the planning of the
crime; and proves that he went into the
venture prepared to conceal his iden
tity. The fact that. Crowhurst knew
nothing of where the disguising bit
of cloth had been found Indicates that
he was telling the* truth when he said
that it was the property of "Schneider.

The University of California has con

to give a performance here on the 23th.
of the same month. The affair will bÂ«
held under the auspices of the boatlnj

BEUKELET. Aug.- 9.â The vigor, nerve I
and grit that helped make Roy Service;
one of the most famous athletes that .
ever cracked iccorda at the University;
of California have inspired him to under- '
take a feat considerably more difficulty
and dangerous than any exploit of his i
college caysâ the feat of christianizing a
part of the. great Chinese empire, which '
hitherto has been almost entirely without j
the pule of missionary effort. i I
Service is planning: to go as a mission- I
ary to China under the auspices of the
Younp Men's Christian Association, and
also in connection with the student vol- I
unicer movement, which latter has en- 1
listed the services of a number of bril- i
llant . and notable collegians throughout
America for duty as missionaries in for
eign fleld9. . â¢ !
The fle;<l which Service will enter in
<:!iir.a lies almost 2000 miles from the sea
ccast, uy one of the Chinese riv<T6 to a
point so remote from the. outside world 1
as to call for courage and faith on the j
part of the Christian pioneer who sets
foot in its precincts. Service has the
courage and also the confidence, and will
soon be on his May to the field that he
has taken a contract to evangelize.
In his day at the University of Califor
nia Service was a crack athlete, a swift
runner, who upheld the honor of the uni
versity in many a . hard-fought, .contest
with Stanford and with colleges in the
East. He broke the -record in a half-mile
dash on the Pacific Coast, his mark, of
1:56 stilt standing for-Â«p<-edy men to aim
at Jn intercollegiate contents. He was the
crack short distance sprinter .selected 'to
accompany the University of California
team on Its* famous trip East in 1900,
when Princeton, Pennsylvania and other
universities competed ,with the Western
ers. He graduated with the class of 1900,
winning honors in scholarship as well as
on the field and cinder path. ..

WASHINGTON. Aug. 9.â Before leav
ing for his vacation Postmaster General
Cortelyou directed the issuance of a
new form of money order, which, it is
believed, will be proof- against altera
tion at the. hands of forgers. The de
partment -has been greatly annoyed
by the operation of persons who pur
chase money orders for small amounts
and rai3c them, passing them on mer
chants after office hours. Although the
direct loss falls on those who accept
the orders, the department refusing to
cash them .e"xcept as orlgiually drawn,
there has been a heavy indirect- expense
involved .in the pursuit, arrest and con
viction of the offenders.
The form adopted will be issued as
soon as the new plates can be prepared
and other necessary -preliminaries in
the way of arrangements madev

Professor Bailey has stated his belief
that a university farm should be re
garded as a work shop, and not a model
farm, and that the best results may t>e
expected when students can step from
the farm to the laboratories in connec
tion with the agricultural college on
the campus, where research work
would be done, supplementing the prac
tical work on the farm. If the commis
sion is guided by this suggestion it;is
supposed that the Haywards people will
have the best hope of success.
! Important action is expected to -"be
taken by the commission appointed. to
I select a site for the university farm 'at
a meeting to be held by the commis
sion this afternoon at 2 o'clock in the
Hopkins Institute of Art. Announcfc
| ment was made at the university, yes
j terday that the members of the com
mission will gather In San Francisco
' to-day and supposedly decide between
i the various offers of land for a uni
versity farm site.
The Legislature appropriated J150,
oo<> for this project and appointed Gov
ernor Pardee, President Benjamin Ide
Wheeler, Elwood Cooper and Profes
sor n. J. Wickson as a commission to
determine the location of the farm." Af
ter the commission had visited sections
of Alameda County and Contra Costa
County, examining proposed sites,
President Wheeler was called East and
the farm mutter was left in abeyance.
With the return of President Wheel
er, and the presence* on the coast of
Professor Liberty Hyde Bailey, direc
tor of tile agricultural college work at
Cornell "University, the university farm
project has been brought to the front
and will now be definitely settled. Pro
fessor Bailey has been asked to. give
the commission the benefit of his ex
perience in such matters, it being .the
belief of President Wheeler that so able
a man could help to guide -the commis
sion aright in the beginning of a work
that is. new in California, but familiar
to Mr. Bailey.
The question that has disturbed the
commission, hitherto has been that of
whether the farm should be adjacent
to the university or in the Interior of
the State. The people of Haywards
have made tempting offers to the com
mission, and offers have also come from
communities in Contra Costa County
that desire the farm to be located near
them. Yolo County has been mentioned
as a strong competitor for the prize,
and other sections of the State are can
didates. - s

some slight trouble with Dr. Herrick.
Dr. William Craycroft and Dr. George
Lovejoy both failed in 1904 merely_,be
causc they had had a little trouble with
Dr. Baird. These men are guilty of un
fairness to the young graduates. Stu
dents have graduated and failed tp gip
a license who could !iave taught almost
every member of the board something
in the practice of dentistry." \u25a0 i
Dr. W. A. Flood came up from Santa
Ana to testify to the fact that he had
seen Dr. Dunn talking to Dr. Papandre
just before the examination in anatoiriy
and that his suspicions were aroused
by this fact. He said that there was
too much whispering by Drs. Dunn, and
Cool with some of tne students during
the examination.
E. Myron Wolf, former attorney; for
the board, told about the prosecution
of all the suits against unlicensed den
tists except that of Dr. Farmer. This
suit was dismissed by Judge Cabani.ss
on the strength of a letter written by
Dr. Baird, which stated that the board
did not want to prosecute.
The commission resumes Its session
at 9 o'clock this morning.
It was during this questioning that
he broke out against certain members
of the Stale Board, his actions indicat
ing that he meant some oÂ£ a the "solid
five." "'College examinations are pass
ed on merit," he said, "but the State
examinations depend on the man's
standing with the board. If he has had
any trouble with certain members of
the board I am perfectly safe in mark
ing him off my list of those who have
passed, for I know that he has no
chance. I can name instances. Dr.
Taylor failed in 1903 because he had
. But this explanation did not satisfy
the commissioners. They wanted to
know why Dr. Coke invariably asked
the student his number before he gave
cut the information. But questions
along this line brought ho answer. Dr.
Coke saying that these were secrets of
his business.
CHARGES UNFAIRNESS.
Dr. Coke told the commission that he
knew the students very well and followed
their lines of work and in this way was
able to tell about what they could do
In the examinations.
In no conversation did I fctate that the
$23<J was to so to Dr. Cool, to Dr. Dunn, to
Dr. Mayhew or to any other membrr of th
board. I did not say to Dr. Varmer that "Dr.
Cool and Dr. Dunn Fay that you are very
lew in your examinations and that you had
better give up the fiZtii." jcot that, nor any
wcrd* to that effect i^asscd my lips.
PAID NOTHING TO DOAHD.
Then Dr. Farmer came to me. He said that
he fc!t that h~ had a Kood chance with tho
board as ihive of them were for him. I asked
him if fci weulu be wi!i!nK to five me ?::50
and leave ii to me to be us^d as I saw fit.
If I <sid not get the license the money was
to be returned to him. He Ilnaliy told me
that he uld net have tJiat much money and
I let St go at that. I did go down to his
office one tvening: in resfxmst to a telephone
call from Ur. Farmer, but the only other
person ili*:re was a lady In the chair. I did
not see this man. John SalÂ«*. who testified
yesterday that he heard the conversation
thc-i c.
Mr. Farmer askÂ»rd me if I did not have a
grÂ»at ceal of influence- with the- board and
I tc'.d him that I had none at all. At this'
time my brother from Oregon was visiting
me. He is a lawyer and I asked him what
he thought the cast was wctln. He told nic
that h'; thought the man had a good claim
and that be would take the case for $SUO. I
toJd him ;iiai Karmtr did not have that much
money. whtreui>un my brothti 6ald that he
wouW lake the case for ?25<J.
.Yesterday's session cf the commission
which is investigating the irregularities
alleged to exist in the State Board of
Dental Examiners was productive of more
siartlina; u-Â£timonv. Before the wit
nrsres were called. Attorney Sanford Fei-
Ser.baum. acting for Dr. Coke, objected to
iJ>e right of the commission to subpena
witnesses, to force them to testify, or
to conduct this or any other investi
gation, on the giousid that there is noth
ing in the statutes entitling it to sit and
hear testimony.
Then Lit. Coke was sworn and he passed
the lie direct to Dr. George C. Farmer,
by liatly denying that ho. Coke, had
Â«ver cftVred to fix the board so that a
license would be granted to Farmer for
J2s<'. He denied having told Dr. S. L.
Braseh that he could get him a license
lor 5100 or save him from molestation
by the board.
In turn he charged certain members of
the board with unfairness in passing on
the merits of certain of the graduates.
He refused to answer questions which
referred to his manner of gaining Infor
mation relative to the grading of stu
dents. He said his information was not
irregular, and when interrogated he swore
tilat the exclusive information that he
had did not come from any one member
of the bourd. He would not say why
he asked each student his number be
fore h*Â« gave the markings.
CORK'S ACTION AXGERS BOARD.
His action ansrered the board and at
the noon recess the members held a con
ference to decide whether they should at
tempt to force the v.-itness to answer
the questions put to him. It was decided
not to compel Dr. Coke to answer any
questions which he thought was secret
to his biifcintsa, but the board reserved
the right to appeal to the Attorney Cen
tral if it became evident that the inves
tigation was blocked because of the wit
ness' refusal to answer questions.
Th* teMlniony of Dr. Coke, thÂ«- dental
â¢>Â»lM'lv iiutu and who hnx keen dabbed
â¢â¢the eixlith member of the board," did
not teud to clear, up the fnveKti^ntion.
He denied any attempt or offer on Ills
part to bribe the bourd or any mem
ber of it. He dinpelled inueh of the
miÂ»;il''!ob cast on Urn, Dunn and Cool
by the nllecntlons of Dr. Farmer on
Tuesday, when he swore that he had
never had any money transactfonit with
either cf these dentists, except when
they ha .3 paid him money for dental
hnpplie*. He admitted that he Ji:iÂ«l told
I urn.rr that it would coett fZTM to **flx
tSitns*."* but by that term he meant the
;><tÂ»*ible t-ost of attorneys* fees* in a
It-pal action to force the board to srnnt
biiu a lUriiÂ«r. He mine that he had
never intended that any of this money
i>h(Â»n!d cv to Dm. Cool snd iÂ»niui or nay
ether member of the board.
OFFERS TO PIT Ll* THE MO.\EV.
â¢"Th<: brother of Ur. Farmer came to
me \u0084*ii-t-t, \u25a0 said Dr. Coke, "and told me
that l>r.~ Farmer had been arrested for |
t.c practice of dentistry without a
license, lie told me that he thought
that his brother had a legal claim
against the board, as he was a grad
uate of a reputable school and it was
only by a mere technicality that the li
cense rs:d not been jrranted in the first
place. He told me that be and Dr.
Farmer were ready to put up the money
that would be necessary to g;et the li
cense. He said that he did not think
the work would be diflicult, because
three members of the board â Drs.
Dunn, Cool and Ifaybew â were in fa
vor of the case. This was In Decem

A VACATION
More than 50 per cent of the babies die before they are one
year old. More than half the deaths, of adults and all, are without
medical attention. This is also because of ignorance. The people
do not trust medical skill. They believe . death and sickness are
caused by evil spirits, and they trust to charms more than to medi
cines or cleanliness. Unless the great trio of medical, engineering
and pedagogical science will unite upon patiently solving the prob
lems of sanitation our newly stimulated expansion policy is likely to
receive severe checks, and future history to write us down as much
less accomplishers than we are undertakers.
Not only have we fallen heir to great responsibilities in the Phil
ippines,, where sanitation is one of the biggest problems, but from'
now on the maintenance of healthful conditions at Panama is a
duty laid to our charge. We must keep the isthmus cleansed of dis
ease inducing conditions as the first assurance of getting the canal
expeditibusly constructed: and when once the big ditch is dug the
health of the whole world will largely depend upon the carefulness
with which we keep its zone free from risks of disease spreading.
Already the Philippine Bureau of Health is calculating that
when the canal is opened to commerce the variety of mosquito which
spreads the yellow fever microbe will be able to live long enough
pn shipboard to make the shortened trip to the islands, and thus
be a new terror to the ignorant inhabitants, who, so far, know not
the plague of our southern coast. It is going to be a time of skilled
doctors to the fore. We will need them almost as much as skilled
engineers; perhaps more, for the provision must first be made to
keep the engineers and their helpers alive and workably healthy else
will their talents be useless in our tropic possessions.
The Filipinos possess so many habits of cleanliness that it will
be difficult to convince them, pending their education, that they
have any customs that are unclean from the civilized standpoint. For
instance, they almost universally wash their dishes in cold water.
If a plate looks clean and is washed in water that looks clean, why,
then, to them it is clean. They do not readily take in the idea of
the mischief done by invisible microbes. Their laundry methods
are also unwholesome. The awful infant mortality of the islands is
due mainly to lack. of education.
HEALTHFUL conditions in the Philippines are not to be at
tained without long and patient efforts, no matter how skill
ful and energetic may be the agents therefor appointed by the
Government. This is shown by the recently issued annual report of
â¢ the Commissioner of Public Health for the islands. One of the
chief reasons for the difficulties in the way of speedy sanitary im
provement is that racial habits and customs which have prevailed
â¢through centuries cannot be changed in a few years. Because of
the fixity of these habits the direct efforts of the sanitary officials
fail in many instances, and the only hope of thorough success lies in
the instruction given to the oncoming generations in the public
schools, and by the force of example.
The question of sanitation has recently become a more vital
one to the United States than it has ever been in our history before.

PHILOSOPHY IN* THE HAYMOW.
SOME PHILIPPINE DIFFICULTIES.
(("pHERE is oleomargarine," said the
I papa goat, reflectively, "and but
terine, and the stuff that is sold
from firkins, and a large number of other
things."
"I -have heard that there Is," said the
kid of the reflective mind.
"So you see that I have plenty of com
petition; and yetâ" the papa goat proud
ly lowered his headâ "l still maintain the
reputation of being the strongest butter
of them all."
Which is why the kid Is very proud of
his father.
Moral: Sometimes the one who butts In
gets the reputation.
Such a canal could be readily enlarged with the progress of. naval
architecture and growth of commerceâ a thing which would be
almost an impossibility with the deep cut to sea level. The Suez
canal is already too small for modern tonnage, and the history
of canals and commerce shows that repeated enlargements of channel
must be provided for and counted upon in all plans.
Another plan proposed by Major Gillette is in regard to the
prevention of seepage in the construction of the Gatun dam. He
proposes to sink pipe, and force, under great pressure, cement grout
through it to close such openings as may be in the sand or gravel
strata. This method of preventing percolation he advises as much
superior to driving down sheet piling.. Not by any means the least
of his arguments is that the canal he proposes could be built in five
years, as compared with the estimates for the others of twelve
years spent in construction.
The fact that he went to Panama with preconceived judgments
ip favor of a sea-level canal and then changed them after an actual
study of the ground gives the paper a special claim to attention,
for men seldom alter their prejudices without stronger reasons for
doing so than those which induced the first favored ideas. He has
had large experience in river control and lock and dam construction.
It Is from the standpoint of an expert in river control that he
sees one of the most grave objections to a sea-level canal. The
river surface of the Chagres is about 55 feet above the sea and the
silt of that and other streams which would pass into the canal would
require constant dredging and necessitate a very wide canal in
order to let the big vessels pass the dredging fleet. The other alter
native of diverting the silty waters would be enormously expensive.
The watershed is 250 square miles and this whole area of flood
must be kept out the canal by dams and by diversion channels. The
canal must occupy the bottom of a narrow valley and the sediment
of even the smaller streams is a serious matter. Some of the rivers
are subject to torrential floods. Similar objections, would hold
ngainst a 30-foot level, and indeed for any lesser height than 100
feet, which is the plan favored by Major Gillette.
A part of the plan of the 100-foot level canal is to be a great
dam at Gatun, the range of hills there being the farthest one north
that crosses and has sufficient height. Such a dam would form a
lake of 100 square miles, with abundant storage waters, and capable
of settling for ages all the mud that the streams would bring down
into it. This dam could be built out of the dirt from the Culebra cut
with a haul of but 25 miles. By this plan $34,000,000 could be saved
and a channel five feet deeper and much wider than the proposed sea
level one would connect the oceans.
EJECTIONS to the sea-level plan of constructing the Panama
( ) canal are shown to be very serious ones in a paper on the
subject written by Cassius" E. Gillette, Major of Engineers,
U. S. A. The major writes a long and studious article from his head
quarters, Pacific Division, Engineer Office, San Francisco, to the
Engineering News of New York, which has the peculiar value of
expressing a reversed opinion arrived at after making a close per
sonal study of the conditions of the isthmus, where he served on the
commission in 1904.

her plans are to spend the winter In
the south of France.
During her absence Mr. Montague
will be a resident of the University
Club.
To-day is set for the wedding of Miss
Caroline Merry and Lieutenant Samuel
W. Bryant in Costa Rica, though ther*
I* doubt surrounding the maturity of
their plans, for Lieutenant Bryant mar
have been detained by quarantine at
New Orleans, from which port he was
to sail.
Miss Carol Moore will o"e hostess to
day at a "telephone tea" for several of
her young friends who happen to be in
town. The affair will be quite informal
and' just a merry gathering: of merry
maids who will have so many pleasant
things to chatter over regarding Miss
Moore's engagement and her fast ap
proaching marriage.
This little tea was to have announced
the happy news, but the tidings cropt
out prematurely.
Miss Helen Ashton is a guest of Miss
Moore and much interest will also
gather about her.
THE primary battle was hard fought and well won by the Republican League,
which secured a safe majority of the coming convention. The opposition mi
nority is large enough, however, to make trading stock in \ case the majority
shall divide and either division be willing to go into the enemy's camp for re
cruits. This should make the majority wary and move it to substantial unity of
policy and action. Sometime elapses before the assembling of the convention and the
work of the League is not over. \
As it organized the people very effectively for the winning of its first fight, it
must nowwatchfully organize for the coming convention and be on guard against
covert intrigues and schemes. The subtlety of the enemy is not to be despised, but to
be guarded against. There was another fight besides that of the League. Mr. McNab's
Democratic organization, representing the best element in that party,' was challenged
to battle by the reorganizes. These are believed to represent the Democratic allies of
the existing city administration and, had they won, their purpose was to indorse the ad
ministration for re-election. This purpose was defeated by the McNab forces, and ho
is still in undisputed control. What he will do with it is a closed book.
It is known that many influential men in his organization are warmly committed
to civic reform and intend to seek to secure it by the most available means. There are
no bonds on the votes oi men at the election, and all will be free to cast an inde
pendent ballot. The independent voters will probably hold the balance of power; and
who wins them wins the day. The plan of the "administration for winning control
of the Republican convention was very cunningly laid and worked without a hitch.
The officials of -the city government and their appointees, and too frequently the elec
tion officers, stood by the programme and were as open in promoting fraud as they
dared be, with the shadow of the penitentiary over them. â¢ . .
The city machine worked all day and did not slip a cog. The people found raised
against them and against good government the hand of official power everywhere.
That hand beckoned the vice and crime of the city and they answered, obeying im
plicitly the order of those who are chosen to office to suppress these vicious and crim
inal influences and not to enter alliance with them. But over it all, in spite of all, the
Republican League ticket won and constituted a convention which may make a ticket
that can win in November, provided proper weight is given to certain remaining ele
ments in the problem.:
The Republican League ticket received 16,071 votes, which elected 246 dele
gates; the administration Republican ticket received 15,420 votes, which elected 153
delegates. The delegate majority for the League is large. Its popular majority is
small, being only 642. But the Republican vote of the administration did not repre
sent all of its strength. It has a leg in both camps, and its Labor party vote was 2955,
which, added to its Republican vote, makes a total strength of 18,384 to the Republi
can League's 16,071, giving the administration a popular majority in the primary
of 2313.
. These figures exhort and admonish. Of course it is obvious that the Labor party
vote, under orders, was divided. Enough of it stood pat to keep the party intact and
give it a convention, and the great majority was used in an attempt to control also the
Republican convention by defeating the League ticket. The manipulation and capa
city for control that can form and carry out such a policy and come so near winning
is by no means to be despised. While the administration lost control of the Republican
c<)iiyen-tion s j,tsjhppe- f .of winning in November is not diminished, but is justified by the
returns. j
It wanted the Republican convention only ftir the purpose of nominating a.can
didate for Mayor that could be easily beaten by the nominee of the Labor party. Every
intrigue that cunning and great political astuteness can devise will still be brought
to bear upon the convention to effect that end. Every man that can be reached will
be reached, all that can be influenced will be influenced to make a weak Republican
nomination that will disgust the independent vote of the city and be easily beaten.
The task of tliej League has only just begun. It is fighting the city administra
tion, and that administration beat it in the popular vote and will beat it at the polls
if it make the least compromise with the enemy. It must push its purpose to the end..
It is a political mistake to talk about making nominations to divide the forces of
the enemy. That cannot be done. The gangsters of Philadelphia never had a more in
divisible force behind them in the Pilgrim band than this compact body that is be
hind the administration. Of course we all know that this solid quantity is in a large
minority in the city. But it is a plurality when the majority divides into two mi
norities. Therefore we administer this physic of figures to the citizens who wish for a
decent government. Their task is only begun. .They cannot put their armor off until
the final fight is won.
The suggestions of the situation are so obvious that we need not take the trouble
to disclose them. They are on the surface arid all men can see them. The interest, re
sponsibility and hope center in the majority of the coming convention. Its business is
to command the confidence and secure the support of a majority of the people in No
vember.

Interesting and entertaining given to any
organization that has ever visited this

It has been suggested that the new rit
ual be exemplified during 1 the session, and
it Is likely that arrangements will be
accordingly.
xar reported:
The San Francisco councils of the
Young Men's Institute have arranged for
an excursion by special train to Sacra
mento for Sunday next to join with dele
gations from Stockton, Marysville, Fres
no, Merced and the Sacramento councils

LSe initiation of a class of candidates.
-yl^y 1^ this will be the concluding exemplifl
ii-uon of the present term It is expected
i fiat a large number of members, accom
jarsied by their friends, will participate
In the excursion. The rate has beÂ«n fixed
at a single fare for the round trip. The
Â»:a;n will leave the Oakland mole on the
arrival of the ferry-boat leaving here at

Dr. Ragan says that warrants will be
sworn out for the arrest of dealers
whose wines arc adulterated and who
refuse to remove the wines from their
shelves or offer them for sale to the
public.
Relative to the presence of arsenic in
wine Gibbs said in' an interview that It
was probably due to the spraying of
some arsenical preparation on the
grapes for the purpose of destroying
parasites. Gtbbs Fays the arsenic might
also be developed from the cleaning of
the wine vats with sulphuric acid, the
commercial kind having arsenic in its
composition.
Since my first report a large amount of
adulterated winta have been removed from thÂ«
market by dealers in addition to that destroyed
by the. Health Board. While there has been
great Improvement, the condition ot the wine
on sale 1Â« far from satisfactory as yet. .
City Chemist H. D. Gibbs filed yester
day his fifth report on the chemical
analysis of 215 samples of dry Cali
fornia red wines taken from various
dealers and manufacturers in this city.
Of these fifty-one were samples in la
beled bottles" and 164 were taken from
barrels and Duncheons.
Out of the total number of samples
analyzed Gibbs reports that twenty-two
contained coal tar dyes, fourteen salicy
lic acid and ten benzole acid. Glbba
says in ' his report that the names of
the manufacturers of the wines from
which samples were taken are not ac
curate in some cases and he takes the
precaution to put an interrogation
point after some of them. The- report
continues:
There were two bad samples analyzed which
are practically unsalable. Twenty-three \u25a0of
the samples contained arsenic ranging from
traces of the poison up to appreciable quanti
ties. The arsenic Is an accidental ingredient
and I propose to take the matter up with tha
dealers and wine growers 'with a view to solv
ing the problem. . . . \u25a0

1 PORTLAND, Aug. 9.â Essick shut out
\u25a0 the Angels this afternoon by pitching
I the steadiest kind of ball. He was
given faultless support in the field. ' In
fact some of the work of the Giants
was phenomenal. Los Angeles might
J have scored in the sixth but' for^ the
I long legs of the veteran Van Buren.
[Dillon laced - one nearly to the. score-
I board and so far did It seem beyond the
reach of any fielder that Bernard on
second crossed the, plate and Smith on
first reached third before Van's fingers
clutched the sphere. The double play
1 retired the side. In the second Mike
â¢ Mitchell made a home run, the ' next
1 two men went out. McLean made a' hit
I and Hoffman was passed. Esslck's two
1 bagger scored them both.
j Hoffman, .lately of the Cotton League,
a little fellow, made a favorable . im

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Aug. 9.â
Manager R. TV. Barrett of the Associ
ated Students, of S the University an
nounced to-day, that the new. football
field in course of construction will not
be completed 'In time for any prelimin
ary practice games. Mr. ' Barrett also
expresses grave doubts as to- the pos
sibility of completing the arena- before
the intercollegiate- freshman, match.
Work upon the old field will start
to-morrow and will be^rushed with all
possible ; speed. | Upon this gridiron j the
seating capacity of the present bleach
ers will .prove, ample; for the prelimin
ary games. -\The-! surrounding fences,,
which are in a bad state, will be re
paired , and- the .b leachers strengthened.
The ; ground will be ; thoroughly plowed
andharrowed and the contract for sev
eral loads â¢of "sawdust has been let.
The field has always been considered a
first-class - gridiron and . will again ably
meet all the demands of the squad. ,
The â¢: new .. field has been graded and
concrete foundations for ,the supports
of ' 4 the '.bleachers have been finished.
Withthe exception' of, this^ not a stroke
of Uvork has been; performed. ; Not a
stick of lumber with which to build, the
grandstand or fence \u25a0 has appeared upon
the scene of operations. The work will,
however,'* be commenced by the middle
of next week and should, - if" properly
rushed,' be far, enough advanced.by No

Both men are practically through train
ing and both are pronounced fit for the
contest.
Sullivan cannot see any such thing as
defeat ahead for McCormick. Last night
the management of the Colma Club was
asked by the McCormick managers if a
match could be arranged for the Texas
giant to meet Jack Jeffries at Colma on
the first Friday in September. It is a
foregone conclusion with them that Mc-
Cormick will beat Ruhlin and Sullivan
says he would like to have him fight
every two weeks and meet every heavy
weight who thinks he ha 3 a chance with
him.
Both Gus Ruhlin and Jim Mc<^ormlck,
who meet, at Colma to-morrow night,
have chosen their seconds for the occa
sion. The mighty John L. Sullivan will
attract much attention as the chief ad
viser of McCormlck. His assistants will
be Jimmy Carroll and Jimmy Kelly. In
the corner with Ruhlin will be Billy Mad
den. It will seem/ strange to the old
timers who may be at the ringside to see
Madden and Sullivan In separate corners,
they having been together so much while
John L. was winning and defending the

OAKLAND.
The cJimax came in the iinal spasm of
the day. Rip Van Haltren had just
chased Busher Pierce to the bench and
trotted Smiling Schmidt out on the mound.
What the Tigers di? to' him was a shame
and an outrage. They hit and hit and
the Commuters booted and booted till
they nearly had paralysis of the feet
and arms. It ended wnen Tacoma had
squeezed six mere runs over.
With the' score 2 to 0 against them in
the fifth, the Commuters pulled them
selves together for a rally and sent three
runs in. It looki-d good then, but the
Tigers commenced to wallop Mr. Hogan
in the sixth and found him for a bunch
ot six runs. Hogan was hit hard, but at
that it was not his fault, as his field
ers were never there, passing up every
thing that skimmed along the grass.
Oakland seemed determined to go some
even if the rally did not get them any
thing, so in their half of the sixth they
cummenced once mere to office up to the
collection of Mr. Brown. They bingled
and ran the bases till three more had ar
rived. But for Kruger's dummy stunt
of pelting caught off second, it might
have been a deadlock. The score:
The frame of baseball at Recreation
lark yesterday was a batting carnival,
an error fest, a fan's dream and a joke,
It started off badly, picked up again,
then foil down, jrrew good looking and
finally finished like a rouÃh house scene
on the Barbary Coast. The Commuters
mad*- seven runs?, but they were also
there win: eleven boots, all of which
ii!luwÂ«-d the Tigers to pile up run after
run.

BUFFALO/ N. V.; Aug. B.â Not until
the last two races on the seven-race card
at Fort Erie to-day did a favorite show
in front, and by that time the books
had reaped quite a harvest. A- race at
one and three-eighths miles was the prin
cipal attraction. There were seven start
ers, of which Our Bessie was the favor
ite. She had no trouble in winning. After
indulging Prince Of Pilsen with the lead
for the lirst several furlongs she went to
the front as soon as Preston called on
her and from there on it was her race
without any trouble. Ink challenged her
in the run home, bdt could not overtake
her. Summary: .K[

_ Eddie Hanlon left . last night for Los
Angeles, where he Is matched with Willie
Fitzgerald. They are to weigh In at 133
pounds.
Jimmy Gardner, who seemed drawn
rather fine when he made 133 pounds at
6 o'clock for Turner, is anxious to fight
Britt at 133 pounds, professing to be able
to do the weight. He will weigh in at
142 pounds when he meets Buddy Ryan,
which shows he .is a big boy.
Mike (Twin) Sullivan is anxious to try
conclusions with Britt. He has sent sev
eral wires to Morris Levy urging his
claims to a match. .
Brltt's friends assert .that he will not
entertain the offer, chiefly on account of
the extra round 3. From present appear
ances Britt will keep Nelson on the anx
ious seat about a match so long that
when they finally talk business the Dane
and his friends will be so dizzy that they
will be glad to accept any proposition.
The men are not likely to meet until the
racing season is in full swing.
l>Â»*Â»dy Bishop disclaims making Nolan
an offer of 65 per cent on Tuesday even
ing when he broached him on the subject
of a match. He was not authorized to
make a specific â¢ offer, but to ascertain
the views of Nolan in the matter.
Unless Battling: Nelson "shows a
proper disposition" it Is on the cards for
Jimmy Britt to fight either Jimmy Gard
ner or Mike (Twin) Sullivan before the
Hayes Valley Club next month.
Before leaving the city for santa Cruz
Willie Britt authorized Morris Levy to
make the best match available for his
brother. Under this heading the Nelson
match is the most attractive, but the
Dane wants to snap up Manager Jim Cof
frotrTs $30,000 for a fight at Colma. which
must be a forty-flve-round affair. This
appeals to him, as the farther he goes the
faster he fights.

i the feature of the day. when In the third
j heat at the head of the stretch King
Direct, pacing strongly, struck his hoof
through the wheel of Locanda'a sulky.
There was a tangle of horses, sulkies and
I drivers almost immediately swallowed in
j a cloud of dust. When the dust cleared
Geers was seen prostrate on the ground.
Driver Snow was on his feet making his
way to the judges' stand; Locanda had
been safely caught and King Direct had
started on a wild runaway, dragging
i along a somewhat shattered sulky.
Soon stable hands and others, including
I a physician, were at Geers* side. It wai
found that he had suffered a bad cut of
; Ijis leg and was stunned, but he speedi
ly recovered his breath, and his first
words were:
"Now don't make a hurrah of this thing
and scare everybody to death for noth

SCROFULA
FROM PARENT TO CHILD
The laws of heredity are invariable
and the diseased blood of parents is
handed down to children in the form of
Scrofula. Being thus deeply rooted
nothing can reach the disease but a con-
stitutional remedy. The very foundation
of the blood is diseased, and until it is
purified and made strong, those who are
born with a scrofulous tendency cannot
have the blessing of robust health. \u25a0
. Cleveland, O:, 122 Brownell St.
I inherited Scrofula from my ancestry,
and this means, cf course, weak, impure
blood and a run-down, debilitated- con-
dition of the system. Treatment of phy-
sicians did not dome anything like the
(rood S. S. S. did last winter when I took
it. It promotes appetite and digestion,
rives Btrength and energy, builds np
tho irener&l health in every way, and in
addition to being an excellent blood pu-
rifier it adds to its buccoss as a remedy
for Scrofula. It did more for me than
anything- I have used, and with pleas-
ure I recommend it. - 8. S. S. completely
cured me of this blightine disease.
MBS. LOUISE COHEN,
S. S. S., the king of blood purifiers, is
the medicine tliat is required, because it
changes the quality 'of the blood by
cleansing it of all poisons and impurities,
building it up and strengthening the. en-
tire system. When S. S. S. has restored
the blood to a healthy condition and
forced oat- the scrofulous deposits, there
is a sure return to health.- No remedy
has ever been found to equal this great
vegetable preparation for the cure of all
diseases arising
PURELY VEGETABLE. th *t write
us all about your
case and we will send you a book describ-
ing the disease and give, without charge,
any. medical advice you may need.

Addie E. Thompson Sues Re
tired Capitalist for Di
vorce, Alleging Cruelty
The United Ftates transport Buford
arrived :n pert yesterday morning, af
ter a Quick run frim Manila. She
brought the Seventeenth Infantry and
the third squadron of the Thirteenth
Cavalry, besides a large number of cas
uals. The trip across the Pacific was
smooth. Great excitement was caused
on board the vessel on July 31, when
t-'rivate Clarence Ruark jumped over
board. It u-a.s just at noontime.
Kut-rk appeared on the deck in his
pajaxnES. He said he wanted some
thing to smoke, and made a dash back
to his rofcm, where he had been confined
â¢n account of alcoholism. He made a
quick dash back to the deck, and. be
fore thÂ«i Â«j mazed passengers, leaped
into the sea. Women shrieked and
children cried as they saw the de
mented soldier jump into the briny.
Chief OXlicer Prank Randall, who was
oa the bridge at the time, promptly
blew two whistles and ordered a life
1 boat lowered at the same time. Life
preservers were thrown overboard to
Kuark, but he refused to grasp them.
Jle proved himself to be a swimmer of
Â» xaraoidinary ability, and struck out,
away from life preservers and from the
Â«o*u titui was lowered to rescue him.
The men in the boat pulled lustily
:n oursait of the crazed soidier and
rescued him. He was taken back to
the ship, practically no worse for his
experience. It was exactly eight min
utes from the time that Ruark jumped
overboard that he was taken back to
the Buford.
On arrival here the Seventeenth In
faurry was taken to the Presidio. It
will leave in a few days for its new
iitatioa at Fort McPherson, Georgia.
The third SQuadron of the Thirteenth
Cavalry will go to Fort Kill. The Bu
foru was twenty-two days from Manila
and eighteen days and eight hours
from Nagasaki. She did not stop at
Honolulu.

, Judge Kerrigan yesterday granted, an
interlocutory decree of. divorce to I?aisy
Clark' Heywood from* William E. Hey
wood on the ground of cruelty. The
couple were, married in Manila when
Heywood was a hospital steward in the
United States army. Belle May Lucero
yesterday filed a suit for divorce from
Peter H. Lucero,, alleging cruelty.
Nine long pages of closely typewritten
matter barely contain the charges and
allegations in the suit for divorce yes
terday brought by Addle E. Thompson
against her husband. James . Thompson,
a retired capitalist. Several of the
charges verge upon the sensational and
the reejuest for alimony in the petition
brought from Judge Murasky an order
restraining the husband defendant from
disposing of money and property until
the conclusion of the suit.
The fair plaintiff states that she was
a widow when she was married to . the
defendant, who is nearly seventy years
old, on April 27. 1902, In San RafaeL
For a time they lived happily together
until wftat she declares to" be the hus
band's insane jealousy caused recrimina
tion. There were stormy scenes between
husband and wife, and the complaint al
leges.that the language of the defendant
was unparliamentary in the extreme.
Several times he accused . her of im
proper relations with other men.
The marital troubles Increased. She
swears that ever since February 1 her
husband has employed private detectives
to shadow her in the hope of securing
comnrcmising" evidence as grounds for dl
voree. accused of this, the com
plainant alleges, -the husband at
tempted to choke her and violently as
saulted her and at the same time. roundly
abused her- mother.
Thompson's income .is represented as
$250 a month. It Is alleged that he has
money In the Crocker Woolworth Bank
and Is preparing- to move the furniture
from their home at 22S Liberty street.
The plaintiff prays, for $125 a month ali
mony and edsts of the suit There are
no children.
FREEDOM GIVEN
TO RAPPMUNDT
Immediately upon being discharged.
Rappmundt was rearrested . by United
States Secret Service Agent Richard H.
Taylor upon a charge of fraudulently
procuring a. certificate of naturalization.
Upon Rapomundt tiling a petition to the
Superior Court asking to have his cer
tificate of naturalization canceled Agent
Taylor released him from custody. Rapp
mundt will apply before one of the Fed
eral Judges to-day to be admitted to
citizenship upon the ground that he has
resided in this country continuously for
the five years last past.
Commissioner Heacock said that he was
convinced that Rappmundi had not in
tended to deceive the court, that his ab
seneÂ« for a year . was In the ' nature of
his employment as a seafaring man and
that he had intended to claim the United
States as his residence.
United States Court Commissioner Hea
cock yesterday gave bis decision in the
case of Paul Kappmundt and Ernest
Groasler and discharged the defendants.
Rappmundt and Groesler had bean
charged with perjury in obtaining natur
alization papers for Rappmundt from
Judge Graham's department of the Su
perior CourJ. The evidence showed it
was six years after coming to this-coun
try, that Rar>i>muudt made his applica
tion, and that one year during that
period had been ; spent by him on a
cruise. - When he made his .application
be appeared in Superior. Judge Graham's
court with Frederick and .Ernest Groes
ler as witnesses. ~ The Judge' was not in
court at the time and the clerk advised
them to see him in his chambers. The
witnesses told the Judge that they had
known Rappmundt "for four or five
years" in this country. Judge Graham
told them that if they could not swear
they had known the applicant to have
been a resident of the United" States
for five years he could not admit Rapp
mundt to citizenship. The trio then
withdrew, and Rappmundt afterward
produced his discharge papers, showing
that he had served on the Grant, the
Tlictis and other vessels In the revenue
service. Employment in the navy en
titles the applicant- to citizenship.' and
the clerk and Judge evidently mistook
Rappmundt for an ex-naval sailor and
the certificate of citizenship was granted
to him.

vice Had Been Performed

Business - 3*cii AVlio - Get Them
ITnloail oa Uncle
Sum.
A twelve-quart duu wfll hold all thÂ«
pennies in Butte, says a Butte (Mont.)
special to the New York Herald. In the
money drawer or cash register of nearly
every business house In Butte there is a
Lin box in oiio corner, anil in It are pen
nies. When the box is full the merchant
puts It under his arm and climbs the
hill to the new postofflce, unloads his ac
cumulation on/ Postmaster Georsa Irvin
and carries home starifr3 for It. â¢
When a chuu under a certain age cornea
Into a store and buys and proffers pen
nies in payment tne pennies are forth
with cast into the little box.
At the postofflce the purchaser of two
2 cent stamps receives a penny back. If
: he has two cents coming after buying
a money order he sets two pennies for it.
As a general thing the pennies given
out In change in the postofflce seldom
get outside the building. Before leaving
the building the owner of the pennies
decider that he or she would rather have
stamps for them, and the exchange Is
made.
So the pennies in circulation In Butt*
hover about the postofflce. Once in a
while an arrival from the East scatters
them among the stores, but eventually
the little disks find their way to the
postofflce. The stores do not make change
In pennies in Butte. Some use postage
stamps.
It has not been so long since pennies N
have been given out in change at the
postofflce. Two or three years ago ft
man bought a money order at the Butte
postofflce. He had two cents in chang*
coming to him, but there were no pennies
with which to pay it. He complained to
the Postofflce Department at Washing
ton, and then came an order directing
that a supply of pennies be obtained and
change made.
Since then there have been pennies la
Butte. Helena and most of the larger of
fices in Montana. But the merchant, as
a general thing, has little use for pen
nies, and It will probably be a long time,
before they come Into circulation in this
part of tha Northwest.
There are no penny newspapers la
Montana. Children always have a nickel
to buy candyâ sometimes more. TherÂ«
are no penny values shown for sale in
this city.
The merchants think the pennies Â»
nuisance: the public look at the matter
In the same light, and if it had not been
for a disgruntled buyer of a money or
der, who failed to appreciate that if the
two cents had been coming the other way
nothing would have been said about It.
the probabilities are that pennies would
be fewer in Butte and other Montana
cities than they are to-day.â Baltimore

viz: Martha Roux. 25C0 tqns; La Perouse; 2SflO
tons; La Tour d'Auvergne, 2930 tons r- total;
8290 ton*. There are a very few names of yea
eels being added to the coal loading' list.i n
Australia, which -at \u25a0 present foots up twent y
vessels, with a carrying capacity of about
55,000 tons. A large portion of this list will
not be due here before the end. of- this jrlar.'
The total coal arrivals for July this year
amount to 35.155 tons; for the same month last
year they amounted to 55.234 tona, showing a
very marked shinkage. Business in the fuel
line is very dull and prices remain unchanged,
but' rales are very light. The spring weather
now prevailing materially reduces . the con
sumption for household purposes, and .'fuel oil
is the principal factor in furnishing steam re-t
qulrements. Labor- troubles at some -of thÂ«
collieries In British Columbia still . exist, al
though an early, settlement' ls promised ;> thÂ«
market prices here have not been disturbed, as
the other sources from which we derive our
British Columbia* supplies are ample, to keep
our market. hers fully provided for. Outward
grain " freights are not showing any. improve
ment: this will serve to deter coal loading ves
sels from seeking this port for profitable . busi
ness, unless they should receive generous com
pensation for the carriage of the coal, which
at present Is Improbable, with the present con

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
There was a marked falling off in the re
ceipts of Potatoes, but there was no improve
ment in prices, there being enough carried-ovcr
stock on hand to meet all requirements.
Onions were plentiful, but steady, with a
moderate movement reported in shipping chan
nels
The 'feature of the vegetable market was the
sudden rise in Tomatoes. Low prices ruled at
the opening, as dealers -wore expecting the
usual heavy dose from the river districts, but
it soon became known that there was an actuaL.
scarcity and holders promptly doubled their
asking prices. A few boxes came In from
across the bay and sold at $1 per box. The
other vegetables were generally, weak and
prices of some descriptions ranged lower.

Hay and FcedsAiffs.
Bran and middlings are quoted firmer, but
no higher. . The situation in Hay shows no
change. The circular of Somers & Co. says:
"Them seems to be but little diminution in
hay shipments, for the total for the week just
ended shows 5200 tons, which is but 400 tons
less than for the week preceding. The hay
tracks and hay wharf are etlll badly blocked
with hay and it still, continues to be a case of
insufficient team facilities. Dally arrivals have
been averaging about 1000 tons and we do not
think that all the hay wagons in town can
haul more than 700 or 800 tons per day. It
can readily be seen that shipments must of
necessity be lessened for a while to enable us
to clean up a bit.
"There is nothing new in the way of outside
demand, so that the -situation has not been
relieved in any way. The strictly fancy grades
of wheat are doing well,** but other varieties
Are if anything a bit lower than last week."
Tame oat hay, most of which shows at least a
little rust, doee not seem to be In as good de
mand as it was two or three weeks ago. In
fact, there Is no activity of any kind to the
market and matters have resolved themselves
down to the. simple proposition of unloading
oars and boats at the best price po&eible, which
of course means continual concessions In prices
In order to effect sales," ' *

CHICAGO Aug. 9. â Rumors of damage to
the Russian crop developed strength in thÂ»
wheat market here to-day. The September de
livery closed %<S'%c up. Corn and oats are
practically unchanged. Provisions are up 7%
@17V>c.
Wheat had a firm undertone throughout thÂ»
entire session, but the volume of trading was
small. September opened unchanged at 82 %@
82% c. The initial firmness was chiefly due to
higher prices at Liverpool in the face of a
decline here yesterday. Russian newspapers,
according to a British authority, are advocat
ing the prohibition of wheat exports. This
agitation coupled with news of a bullish char
acter from Indiana, was said to be responsible
for the unexpected advance at Liverpool. On
the other hand, weather in the Northwest
was almost perfect for harvesting, and there
was a continuance of liberal receipts at pri
mary points. The bulls gained some encourage
ment from a favorable report of damage to the
crop in North Dakota. The. principal demand
came from shorts and commission houses. Of
ferings were not large. For September the
highest point of the day was reached at S3%c.
The market closed firm, with September at M
653% c
Fresh reports' from Illinois of damage by
hot dry weather caused a firm tone in the
corn market. The market \u25a0 closed .steady. Sep

The New York Â«sÂ»rculars of the two well-
houst-s of J. S. Bache & Co. and Henr>
Clews give ths following rosy views of thÂ«
jrrbab.e future cf the stock market:
J. is. Eachc & Co. â Much more interesting
and ot greater significance than movements of
prices were reports of earnings of several of
the principal companies. Pennsylvania for
June showed an unexpectedly large increase la
gross, amounting to *l,cyo.i'Oo; thÂ« small de
crease in net wu not unlooked for. as the
company is again charging heavy btttermera
outlays to operating expenses. The reports ot
Chesapeake and Ohio and Norfolk and West
ern for the riscai year were by all means the
k>eft en record, showing earnings of 4 per cent
and 7 \<er cent, respectively, on stocks. Ca
nadian Pacific and Southern Railway have
Just closed the moat prosperous years in tluir
Matorjr. Ijacitawanna in the first six months
of the current year earned 31 per cent, or at
the rate of 02 per cent per annum on the
$2C.â¬oo,<joo stock. Atchlscn's yearly statement
vas a poor one by reason of unprecedented
floods in its territory, but in spite ol a $3.u00.-
C>Cx> decrease in net the common stock earned
nearly 7 per cent. These reuorts of enormous
irafric and earnings are such as to be of ex
tivme importance in molding public opinion
to appreciate at their true value the standard
railroad shares. In the long rua it is earnings
and dividend* that make prices, and the con
clusion is inevitable that with excellent crops
assured the standard shares will eeek a hlgbei
irvel of jxices.

cent, against .57 per cent tor the latter. The

Â¥:r. of the buying on receseions and the abeo-
T.'.e failure of the bears to dislodge lon*
Block.
Stc-el issues continued strong throughout tho
week and what lltths chanre in the steel trade
toe* place was in the way of increased activ
ity. Advances in the equipment companies'
t-iiares reflected an increased volume of orders,
either actually placed or in eight, and thi&
Improvement Sn turn was reflected in a better
market for steei plates. Conservative esti
n;&tes pace the Steel Corporation's earnings
for July a.t a little over $11,000,000. or nearly
equal to the July figures of 13C2 and 1803. >"â¢â¢

fact the present price of Bfcares haÂ« by no

sued ytsttrday. Amalgamated Copper was ia
a dormant state, after having been entirely
unrcsixjasive yesterday to an additional ad
vance in the price of copper. Smelting re
sumed its flight to new high record levels
I without definite news announcement to ac-
I count for it. The coalers showed some effect
1 on profit taking on theVr recent advances, al-
J though Delaware and Hudson sold up to a
new high record. The. slump in National
Enameling was eaMly explained as the result
of the passing of its dividend, and com prod
uct? preferred was further depressed as a
cor.bequerice of the internal dissensions among
the owners of the property.
The flurry In th? Denver banking world
j was a factor in the late reaction. Some
j weakness developed in the ircn and steel
i stocks when it was known that the Iron Age
1 statistics for July showed an additional ac-
I cumulation of stocks of pig iron on hand in
; spite of a further curtailment of production
las compared with June. The weekly review of
! trade, however, was very cheerful.
The market closed heavy. Eonds were lr

Mr. Van Ness said he would prove
also that the collision between the Owl

switch on December 20, 1902, was not
the fault of the company, but due to
the absent-mindedness of the engineer
on the Stockton flyer. He would prove,
also, he added, that the flyer was prop

of collision and that the engineer re

EAST AT LOW RATE.
This condition is attributed to the
large "quantity of canal â¢" material
shipped to the .isthmus, tying up' the
rolling stock of the railroad and pre
venting its- use for the* prompt trans
ferring of commercial freight between
Panama and Colon. \u25a0
It was admitted that sometimes as
much as fifty and sixty days and- even
more are consumed in transit between
New York and San Francisco via Pan
ama, where formerly/the time was from
thirty-six .to forty-two days. v .
With regard to the matter of. rail
road rates, it was said that the ;Pan
ania Railroad Company on a $5 rate
for a 19Sl-mile service was getting' a
far .better revenue on the service than #
the Pacific Mall with. the carriage of. 3473*
miles and a rate of from $6 to $8 per ton.
When asked whether- the -Pacific Mail
was-going to' establish a rate- to com
pete with the $5. per. '2240- pounds
established by the Panama Railroad
Company from New York to Cfolon, the
Pacific Mail people asked how . they
could be expected to^do' so in .view of
the great difference in , the time and
distance of transportation â
With regard to" that part of Evans'
report which states "that the reduced
railroad rates have opened the market
to the East and Importations from the
Pacific Coast are falling off," a repre
sentative of The Call interviewed F.,R.
Peake, local agent of the Panama Rail
road' Company. ,
Peake, said that on May 23 the Pan
ama- Railroad steamship line estab
lished a rate of. $5 per 2240 pounds
from New York to Colon on all ordi
nary; freight, irrespective of its weight
or measurement, consigned to the Isth
mian Canal Commission. Peake said
that President Shonts at Panama at
present with the object of remedying
any evils that may exist. ....
At the Pacific Mail Steamship Com
pany's office it was said that there'is
a very .bad -blockade /of freight on the
Isthmus â so much so that steamships of
the company have for some months. past
been unable to maintain the schedule.
HOI.LI.\G STOCK TIED UP.
' AH of the steamers irom Panama to San
Francisco are conseijuently from two to eight
een days late. The Pacific Mall steamship
due to leave heiÂ£" on August ID will probably
not have arrived in port by that date. .
â¢ Th# situation, therefore, entails great loss
to the Pacific Coast merchant at both ends.
Xot only are his orders for, export shipments
canceled, but he is unable to till domestic or
ders because of the non-arrival of goods.
The result of the order U that all commer
cial, freight will have to be handled by lighters
between ship and shore, a- method that must
seriously add to the gravity of the situation,
as the Panama Railroad Company, . .since the
completion of Its docking lacillties. has \u25a0 al
lowed Its lighterage equipment to deteriorate.

The first of the damage suits that will |
be the (inevitable, outcome of the collapsa â¢
of the four-atory frame building at the I
corner of Ninth and Tehama streets on
July 8 last was filed yesterday morning,
when Morie Garguilo brought suit against
the contractor and city officials for $5000
and costs. Garguilo was Injured at the
time of the collapse, in which Samuel
Cowap was killed, and' the verdict of the
Coroner's jury held that insufficient brae- J
ing was the cause of the accident and
recommended a new system of building
inspection for the city.

made -defendant, together with Public
Works Commissioners Maestretti, Egan
and Aigeltinger . and the bondsmen, in
cluding the Aetna Indemnity Company.
The Inclusidn of the Board of .Public
Works Is the result of the jury's report
and""the testimony of a building inspector,
who testified at the inquest that the sys
tem !of inspecting buildings J was practi
cally a" farce. "
Garguilo was" working as a plumber on
the first-floor of the building, along with
Samuel Cowap. At the ; first ; sound of |
danger . hoth men ran for shelter, and i
Cowap .was caught beneath an avalanche
of boards and beams and. died on the way
to the Central Emergency Hospital. Gar
guilo was 5 more "fortunate and escaped
with injuries to his; right foot and leg.
The injuries have since incapacitated him
from work. Â£V ' â¢ ' â¢ .

ficate of the .was destroyed -by

ing Holden's wife. The flitters. are from
Oakland and Honolulu, and the last one

from him. saying that he was in, a hos-'

KAUFMANN'S SUMMER CLEARANCE
Our summer clearance is proving a great successâ like all of
Kaufmann's sales. This sale is occasioned both by late shipments
and consequent heavy discounts from fhe manufacturers andour in-
variable rule to clear the shelves every season! :

they are returning from everywhere with sunburnt skins and worn-
out shoes to be in time for the opening of school. Though this is a
summer clearance it includes many lines greatly reduced which arc
particularly suitable for school wear, as a glance at the following
