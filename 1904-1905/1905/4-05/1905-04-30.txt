Â°3 T was in the year *S5 that a com-
IT was in of year '35 that which 1
ion of events, into which 1
X need not enter, caused Sherlock
> Holmes and myself to spend some
"weeks in one of our great university
towns, and- it was during this time that
the small but instructive adventure
which I am about to relate befell us. It
â will be obvious that any details which
â would help th* reader to exactly iden
tify the college or the criminal would
be injudicious and offensive. So painful
a scandal may well be allowed to die
out. . With due discretion the incident
itself may, . however, be described, since
it serves to â  illustrate some of those
qualities for which my friend was re
markable. I will endeavor in my state-,
ment to avoid such terms as would
serve to limit the event? to any partic
ular place or give a clew as to the peo
ple concerned. ;~v â 
We were residing at the time in fur
nished lodgings close to a library where
Sherlock m Holmes was pursuing some
laborious researches in early English .
chartersâ researches ' which led to re
sujts-so striking that they may be the
subject of one of my future narratives.
Here it was that one evening we re
ceived a visit from an acquaintance,
Hilton Soames, tutor and lecturer at
the College of St. Luke's. Mr. Soames
Mas a tall, spare man, of a nervous
aÂ©d excitable temperament. I had al
*'ayÂ« t known him to be restless in his
manner, but on this particular occa-'
sion he was in such a state of uncon
trollable agitation that it was clear
something very unusual had occurred.
*1 trust, Mr. Holmes, that you can
spare me a few hours of your valuable
that. We have had a very painful Inci
dent at St. Luke's, and really, but for
the happy chance of your being in<own
1 should have been at a loss what to
do." f , . . .......
"I ad very busy just. now and I de
sire no distractions," my friend an
swered. "I should much prefer that you
it-ailed in the aid of the police." n
"No, no, my dear sir; such a. course
is . utterly .impossible. . When olee the
law is evoked it cannot be stayed
again, and this is. Just one of those'
cases where, for the credit of the col
lege, it Is most essential- to avoid scan
dal. Your discretion is as well known
at your powers and you are the one
man in the world wbu Â£aiVbjEJ*i me. I
beg you, Mr. Holmes, to do what you
can." .' . -\_ â -.. . .... . ..... , -â â  ; v :
My friend's temper had not improved
since he had been deprived of the con-.,
genial- surroundings \of Baker 'street.
Without his scrapbooks, his chemicals
and^his homely untidiness, he was such
an uncomfortable man. He shrugged
his shoulders in ungracious acquiesc
ence, while our visitor in hurried words
and with much excitable gesticulation
poured forth his story.
"I must explain to you, Mr. Holmes,
that to-morrow is the first 'day of the
examination for the Fortescue schol
arship. I am one of the ;. examiners.
My subject is Greek, and the first of
the papers consists of a large passage
of Greek . translation which the can
didate has not seen. This passage is
printed on the examination paper, and
it would naturally be an. immense
advantage if the candidate could pre
pare it in advance. For this reason
great care is. taken to keep the paper
secret. ' ; â¢â¢ : - * â¢ â  '
"To-day, about 3 o'clock, the proofs
of this paper arrived from the printers.
I had to read it over carefully, as the
text must, be absolutely correct. At
four-thirty my task was not yet com
pleted. I had, however, promised to
taks tea ;in a friend's rooms, so I left
the proof upon my desk. I was ab
sent rather more than an hour.
. "You are aware, Mr. Holmes, that
our college doors are double a green
baize one within and a heavy oak one
without. As I approached my outer
door I was amazed to see a key in -it:
For an instant I. imagined that I had
left my own key there, but on feeling
In my pocket I found that it v.as all
right. The only duplicate which ex
isted, so far as I knew," was that which
belonged to my servant, \ Bannisterâ
a man who has looked after my room
for ten years and whose honesty is ab
solutely above-suspicion. â¢ I found that
the key was Indeed his, that he' had
entered my room to know, if I wanted
tea. and that he had very car^lesslv
left the key in the door when he came
out His visit to my room must have
been within a. very, few minutes of my
leaving it. His forgetfulness about
the key would have mattered little
upon any other occasion, but on this
one day it has produced tho most de
plorable consequences.
'The moment I looked at my table
I was aware that some one had rum
maged among my papers. The proof
was in 'three long slips. ll I had left
them all together. Now I .found that
one of them was lying on . the floor
one was on the side . table near the
â window and the third was where I
had left it."
Holmes stirred for the first time. '
The first - i>Â»fi:e on the floor, the
second in the window, the third where
you left it," said he.
"Exactly,. Mr. Holmes. You amaze
me. .How could you possibly know
that?"
"Pray continue your interesting
statement" . . â¢
â¢'For an instant I imagined that
Bannister, had taken the unpardonable
liberty of examining my papers. Ho
denied' it, however, with the utmost
earnestness, and I am" convinced that
he was speaking: the truth. The al
ternative was that some. one passing
had observed the key In the door, had
known that I was! out and had en
tered to look at the papers, a large
sum of money is at stake," for - the
scholarship' is a very valuable one, and
an unscrupulous man might ,very. well
run a risk in order to .gain an advan
tage over his fellows. .. V '.
"Bannister was ; very ' much ~: upset
by the incident J He 1 had nearly faint
ed when we found that the 'papers
had undoubtedly been. tampered with.
I gave him a little . brandy and . left
him collapse in a chair, whJI<Â»..I. made
a most careful examination* of "the
room. I soon saw -that- the intruder
had left other traces â¢of â¢ his presence
besides the. rumpled papers. . On .ttte
table in the window* were several
shreds from a â¢ pencil which ' had . been
sharpened. A broken tip* of lead was .

lying there also. Evidently the rascal
hud copied the paper in a great hurry,
had broÃ^n his pencil and had been
compelled to put a fresh point on it."
"Excellent!" said Holmes, who was
recovering his good humor as his at
tention became more engrossed by the
case. "Fortune has been your friend."
"This was not all. I have a new
writing table with :Â». fine surface of
red leather. I am prepared to swear,
.md fo is Bannister, that it was smooth
and unstained. Now P found a clean
cut in it about three inches long â not
a mere scratch, but a positive cut.
Not only this but on the table I found
a small ball of black dough or clay,
with specks of something which looks
like sawdust in It. I am convinced
that these marks were left by the man
who rifled the papers. There were no
footmarks and no other evidence as to
his identity. I was at my wits' ends,
when suddenly the happy thought oc
curred to me that you were in the
town, and I came straight round to put
the matter into your hands. Do help
me, Mr. Holmes. You see my dilem
ma.. Either I must find the man or
else the examination must be post
poned until fresh papers are prepared,
and since this cannot be done without
explanation, there will ensue a hideous
scandal, which will throw a cloud not
only on the co-liege, but on the uni
versity. Above all things, I desire to
settle the matter quietly and dis
creetly."
"I shall be happy to look into it and
to give you such advice as I can,"
said Holmes, rising and putting on
his overcoat. "The case is not entire
ly devoid of interest. Had any one
visited you in your room after the
papers came to you?"
â¢â¢y>s, young Daulat Ras, an Indian
student, who lives on the same stair,
came in to ask me some particulars
about the examination."
"For which he was entered?"
â¢Yes."
"And the papers were on your ta
ble?"
"To the best of my belief, they were
rolled up."
"But might be recognized as proofs?"
"Possibly."
"No one else in your room?"
"No."
"Did any one know that these proofs
would be there?"
"No one save the printer."
"Did this man Bannister know?"
"No, certainly not. No one knew."
"Where is Bannister now?"
"He was very ill, poor fellow. I left
him collapsed in the chair. I was in
such a hurry to come to you."
"You left your door open?"
"I locked up the papers first." â 
"Then it amounts to this, . Mr.
Soames, that, unless the Indian stu
dent recognized the roll as being proofs,
the man who tampered with them came
up*â¢ them accidentally without know
ing that they were there."
"So it seems to me."
Holmes gave an enigmatic smile.
"Well," said he, "let us go round.
Not one of your cases, Watsonâmen
tal, not physical. All right; come if
you want to. Now, Mr. Soamesâ at
your disposal!"
The sitting-room of our client opened
by a long, low, latticed window on to
the ancient lichen-tinted court of the
old college. A Oothic arched door led
to a worn stone staircase. On the
ground floor was the tutor's room.
Above were three students, one on each
story. It was already twilight when
we reached the scene of our problem.
Holmes halted and looked earnestly at
the window. Then he approached it
and, standing on tip-toe with his neck
craned, he looked into the room.
"He must have entered through the
door. There is no opening except the
one pane," said our learned guide.
"Dear me!" said Holmes, and he
smiled in a singular way as he glanced
at our companion. "Well, if there is
nothing to be learned here we had best
go Inside."
The lecturer unlocked the outer door
and ushered us into his room. We stood
at the entrance while Holmes made an
examination of the carpet.
"1 am afraid there-are no signs here,"
said he. "One could hardly hope for
any upon so dry a day. Your servant
seems to have quite recovered. You
left him in a chair, you say. Which
chair?" \
"By the window there."
"I see. Near this little table. You
can come in now- I have finished with
the carpet. Let us take the little table
first. Of course, what has happened Is
very clear. The man entered and took
the papers, sheet by sheet, from the
central table. He carried them over to
the window table, because from there
he could see If you came across the
courtyard, and so could effect an, es
cape."
"As a matter of fact, he could not,"
said Soames, "for I entered by the Bide
door."
"Ah, that's good! Well, anyhow, that
was in his mind. Let me see the three
strips. No finger Impressionsâ no! Well,
he carried over thjs one first and he
copied it. How long would it take him
to do that, using every possible con
traction? A quarter of* an hour, not
less. Then he tos.sed It down and seized
the next. He was "in the midst of that
when your return caused him to make
a very to utried retreatâ very hurried,
since he had not time to replace the
papers, which would tell you that he
had been there. You were not aware
of any hurrying feet on the stair as
you entered the outer door?""
"No. I can't say I was."
"Well, he wrote' so furiously that he
broke his pencil and had, as ytfu ob
serve, to. sharpen it again. This is of
interest, Watson. The pencil w*s not
an ordinary one. It was above the
usual size, with a soft lead, the outer
color was dark blue, the maker's name
was printed in silver lettering and the
piece remaining is only about an inch
and a half long. Look for such a pencil,
Air. Soames, and you have got your
man. When I add that he possesses a
large and very blunt knife, you have an
additional aid."
Mr. Soames was somewhat over
whelmed by this Hood of information.
"I can follow the other points," said
he, "but really, in this matter of the
lengthâ"
Holmes held out a small chip with
the letters NN and a space of clear
wood between them.
"You see?"
"No, I fear that even nowâ"
"Watson, I have always done you an
injustice. There are others. What could
this NN be? It is the end of a. word.
You are aware that Johann Faber is
the most common maker'? name. Is it
not clear that there is just as much of
the pencil left as usually follows the
Johann?" He held the small table side
ways to the electric light. "I was hop
ing that if the paper on which he wrote
was thin some trace of it might come
through upon this poltehed surface. No,
I see nothing. I don't think there is
anything more to be learned here. Now
for the central table. This small pellet
Is, I presume, the black, doughy mass
you spoke of. Roughly pyramidal in
shape and hollowed out, I perceive. As
you say, there appear to be grains of
sawdust in it. Dear me, this Is very in
teresting. And the cutâ a positive tear,
I see. It began with a thin scratch and
ended in a jagged hole. I am much in
debted to you for directing my atten
tion to this case, Mr. Soames. Where
does that door lead to?"
"To my bedroom."
"Have you been in it since your ad
venture?"
"No, I came straight away for you."
"I should v like to have a glance
round. What a charming, old-fash
ioned room! Perhaps you will kindly
wait a minute, until I have examined
the floor. No, I see nothing. What
about this curtain? You hang your
clothes behind it. If any one were
forced to conceal himself in thrs room
he mrfst do it there, since the bed is
too low and the wardrobe too Bhallow.
No one there, I suppose?"
As Holmes drew, the curtain I was
aware, from some little rigidity and
alertness of. his attitude, that he was
prepared for an emergency. As a mat
ter of fact, . the .drawn curtain dis
closed nothing but three or four suits
of clothes hanging from a line of pegs.
Holmes turned away and stooped sud
denly to the floor.
"Halloa! What's thte?"' said he.
It was a small pyramid of black,
putty-like stuff, exactly like the one
upon the table of the study. Holmes
held it out on his open palm in th*
glare of the electric light.
"Ydur visitor seems to have left
traces in your bedroom as well as in
your sitting-room, Mr. Soames."
"What could he have wanted there?"
"1 think it is clear enough. You
came back by an unexpected way, and
s<r he had no warning until you were
at the very door. What could he do?
He caught up everything which would
betray him and hA rusned into your
bedroom to conceal Hiimself."
"Good gracious, Mr. Holmes, do you
mean to tell me that all the time I was
talking to Bannister in this ru-om we
had the man prisoner if we had only
known it?"
â¢ "So I read it."
"Surely there is another alternative,
Mr. Holmes. 1 don't-- know whether
you observed my bedroom window?"
"Lattice-paned, lead framework,
three separate windows, one swinging
on hinge and large enough to admit a
man." . r
"Kxactly. And it looks out on an
angle of the courtyard so as to be
partly invisible. The man might have
effected his entrance there, left traces
as he passed through the bedroom, and
finally, finding the door open, have es
caped that way."
Holmes shook his head impatiently.
"Let us be practical," said he. "I
understand you to say that there are
three students who use this stair, and
are in the habit of passing your door?"
"Yes, there are." :
"And they are all in for this exam
ination?"
"Yes."
"Have you any reason to suspect any
one of them more than the others?"
Soames hesitated.
"It is a very delicate question," said
he. "One hardly likes to throw sus
picion where there are no proof 3."
"Let us hear the suspicions. I will
look after the proofs."
"I will tell you then in a few words
the character of the three men who in
habit these rooms. The lower of' the
three is Gilchrlst, &. fine scholar and
athlete, plays in the Rugby team . and
the cricket team \f or' the college, and
got 'his blue for the hurdles and the
lemg jump. He is a fine, manly fellow.
His father was the notorious Sir Jabez
Gilchrlst, "who ruined himself on the
turf. iMy scholar has been left very
poor, but he- is hardworking., and in
dueU-ious. He wlll^do well.
"The second floor is inhabited by
Daulat Ras, the Indian. He is a quiet
inscrutable fellow, as most of those
Indians are. He is well up in his work,
though his Greek is his. weak subject.
He is steady ahd ' methodical.
"The top floor belongs to Miles Mc-
Laren. He Is a brilliant fellow when

"I really don't think he knew much
about it, Mr. Holmes. He was look
ing very bad â quite ghastly."
"You stayed here when your mas
ter left?"
"Only for a few minutes or so. Then
I locked the door and went to my
room."
"Whom do you suspect?"
"Oh, I would not venture to say,
sir. I don't believe there is any gentle
man in this university who is capable
of profiting by such an action. No, sir,
I'll not believe it."
"Thank you, that will do," said
Holmes. "Oh, one more word. You
have not mentioned to any of the three
gentlemen whom you attend that any
thing Is amiss?"
"No. sirâ not a word."
"You haven't seen any of them?"
"No, sir."
"Very good. Now, Mr. Soames. we
will take a walk in the quadrangle, if
you please."
Three yellow squares of light shone
above us in the gathering gloom.
"Your three birds are all in their
nests," said Hc/lmes, looking up. "Hal
loa! What's that? One of them seems
restless enough."
It was the Indian, whose dark sil
houette appeared suddenly upon his
blind. He was pacing swiftly up and
down his room.
"I should like to have a peep at each
of them," said Holmes. "Is it pos
sible?"
"No difficulty in the world," Soames
answered. "This set of rooms is quite
the oldest in the college, and it is not
unusual for visitors to go over them.
Come along and I will personally coo
duct you." â¢ ' *
"No names, please!" said Holmes, as
we knocked at Gilchrist's door. A tall,
flaxen-haired, slim young fellowÂ»opened
it and made us .welcome wben he un
derstood our errand. There were some
really curious pieces of medieval do
mestic architecture within. Holmes
was so charmed With one of them that
he 'insisted on drawing it In his note
book, broke his pencil, had to borrow
one from our host and finally borrowed
a knife to sharpen his own. The same
curious accident happened to him in
the rooms of the Indian â a silent, lit
tle, hooknosed fellow, who eyed us
askance and was obviously glad when
Holmes' architectural studies had come
to an end. I could not see that in
either case Holmes had come upon tht
clew for which he was searching. Only
at the third did our visit prove abor
tive. The outer door would not open
to our knock and nothing more sub
stantial than a torrent of bad language
came from behind it. "I don't care
who you are. You can go to blazes!"
roared the angry voice. "To-morrow**
the exam, and^l won't be drawn by
any one."
"A rude fellow," said our guide,
flushing with anger as we withdraw
down the stair. "Of course, he did not
realise that it was I who was knock
ing, but none the less his conduct was
very uncourteous. and indeed, under
the circumstances rather suspicious."
Holmes' response was a curious ont.
"Can you tell me his exact height?"
he asked.
"Really, Mr. Holmes, I cannot under
take to say. He is taller than the In
dian, not ao tall as Gilchrist. I sup
pose five foot six would be about it."
"That ia very important. " said
Holmes. "And now, Mr. Soames,- I
wish you good-night."
Our guide cried aloud in his aston
ishment and dismay. "Good gracious.
Mr. Holmes, you are surely not going
to leave me in this abrupt fashion!
You don't seem to realize the position.
To-morrow is the examination. I must
take some definite action to-night. I
cannot allow the examination to be
held If one of the papers has been tam
pered with. The situation must bÂ«
faced."
"You must leave it as it is. I shall
drop round early to-morrow monring
and chat the matter over. It is pos
sible that I may be in a position then
to indicate some course of action.
Meanwhile you change nothing Iânothing1 â noth
ing at all."
"Very good, Mr. Holmes."
"You can be perfectly easy Ja your
mind. We shall certainly find some
way out of your difficulties. I will take
the black clay with me, also the pencil
cuttings. Good-by."
When we were out in the darkness of
the quadrangle we again looked up at
the windows. The Indian still paced
his room. The others were Invisible.
"Well, Watson, what do you think of
It?" Holmes asked as we came out into
the main street. "Quite a little parlor
gameâ sort of three-card trick, i* it
not? There are your three men. It must
be one of them. You take your choice.
Which is yours?"
"The foul-mouthed fellow at thÂ« top.
He is the one with the worst record.
And yet that Indian was a sly fallow
also. Why should he be pacing his
room all the time?"
"There is nothing in that. Many men
do it when they are trying to learn a*y
thing by heart."
"He looked at us in a queer way."
"So would you if a flock of strangsrs
came in on you when you were pre
paring for an examination next day
and every moment was of value. No, I
see nothing In that. Pencils, toe, and
knivesâ all waj satisfactory. But that
fellow does puzzle me."
"Who?"
"Why, Bannister, the servant. WhafÂ«
his game in the matter?"

fectly honest man."
"So he did me. That's fne puaslinff
part. Why should a perfectly honest
manâ well, well, here' 3 a large station
er's. We shall begin our researches
here."
There were only four stationers of
any consequence in the town, and at
each Holmes produced his pencil chips
and bid high for a duplicate. All wÂ«rÂ»
agreed that one could be ordered, but
that it was not a usual size of pencil
and that it was seldom kept in stock.
My friend did not appear to be de
pressed by his failure, but shrugged his
shoulders in half-humorous resignation.
"No good, my dear Watson. This, the
best and only final clew, has run to
nothing. But. indeed, I have little
doubt that we can build up a sufficient
case without it. By Jove! my dear fel

ever, before we have solved the proo
lem of the nervous tutor, the careless
servant and the three enterprising stu
dents."
Holmes made no further allusion to
the matter that day. though he sat lost
in thought for a long time after our be
lated dinner. At 3 in the morning he
came into my room just as I finished
my toilet.
"Well. Watson." said he. "it is time
we went down to St. Luke's. Can you
do without breakfast?"
"Certainly."
"Soames will be in a dreadful fidget
until we are able to tell him something
positive."
"Have you anythmg positive to tell
him?"
"I think so."
"You have formed a conclusion***
"Yes, my dear Watson, I have solved
the mystery."
"But what fresh evidence could you
have got?"
"Aha! It is not for nothing that I have
turned myself out of bed at the untime
ly hour of 6. I have put in two hours'
hard work and covered at least &â¼â¢
miles, with something to show for it.
Look at that!"
He held out his hand. On the oalm
were three little pyramids of black,
doughy clay.
"Why. Holmes, you had only two
yesterday."
"And one more this mornin*. It is a
fair argument that wherever No. 3
came from is also the source of Nos.
1 and 2. Eh, Watson? Well, come alonÂ«
and put friend Soames out of his
pain."
The unfortunate tutor was certainly
in a state of pitiable agitation when we
found him in his chambers. In ft few
hours the examination would com
mence, and he was still in the dilemma
between making the facts public and
allowing the culprit to compete for the
valuable scholarship. He could hardly
stand still, so great was his mental
agitation, and he ran toward Holmes
with two eager hands outstretched.
"Thank heaven, that you hare come!
I feared that yoji had given it ua In
despair. What am I to do? Shall the
examination- proceed-*"
"Yes, let it pifoceed, by all means. '
â  "But this rascal,â '"
"He shall not compete."

Bannister entered, and shrank back
in evident Burprise and fear at our
judicial appearance.
"You will kindly close the door."
said Holmes. "Now, Bannister, willyou please tell us the truth about yes

Bannister licked his dry lips.
"There was no man, sir."
"Ah, that's a pity. Bannister. Up to

The man's face set in sullen defiance.
"There was no man. sir."

An instant later the tutor returned,

Well, well, don't trouble to answer,
Listen, and see that I do you no in

"From the moment, Mr. Soames, that
you said to me that no one. not even
Bannister, could have told that the pa- .
pers were in your room, the case be
gan to take a definite shape in my
mind. The printer one could, of course,
dismiss.. He could examine the papers
in his own office. The Indian I also
thought nothing of. If thejproof3 were â

they were. On the other hand, it
seemed an unthinkable coincidence that
a man should dare to enter the room
ar.d that by chance on that very day
the papers were on the table. I dis
missed that. The man who entered *
knew that the papers were there. How
did be know?
"When I approached your room I ex
amined the window. You amused me
by supposing that I was cc-ntempjat
ing the possibility of some one hav
ing in broad daylight, under the eyes
of all these opposite rooms, forced
himself through it. Such an idea was
absurd. I was measuring how tall a
man would need to be in order to gee,
as he passed, what papers were un the
central table. lam six feet high and I
could do it with an effort. No one less
than that would have a chance. Al
ready you see I had reason to think
that, if one of your three students was
a man of unusual height, he was the
most worth watching of the three.
"I entered and I took you into my
confidence as to the suggestions of the
side table. Of the center table I could
make nothing, until in your descrip
tion of Gilchrist you mentioned that he
was a long distance jumper. Then the
whole thing came to me in an instant
and I only needed certain corrobora

â  What happened was this. This
"But what about the woman â the
poor rich woman? Perhaps â perhaps
she might hate her riches â she might
just loathe them. But what could she
do? Perhaps they came to her and she
could not get rid of them any more
than she could change the color of her
eyes or the shape of her nose! And
what if â in spite of it allâ she loved
you? Shouldn't you consider her at
all?"
"Great Scott!" exclaimed Askew
with mock dismay. "How did we ever
get into such a sentimental discussion
âtwo good comrades like you and me?
By the way," he went on quickly, "have
1 happened to mention to you that I'm
going off for a while, possibly for
good? It's an excellent business offer,
but it takes me to the other side of the
continent. I have not actually decided,
but I shall doubtless accept it. Indeed,
I can scarcely afford not to for several
reasons."
He did not look at her and she was
thankful for even that small sign of
perturbation on his part. A quick reso
lution seized her. It was leap year â
blessed thought â and why should not a
woman, once in a thousand years or
so. stand up and demand her own as
fearlessly and directly as a man would
do? Had she not, by every wile that a
woman may use, tried to make him ac
knowledge his love for her? Never â
never â never would he ask her to mar
ry him because of her millions. Well,
then, she would ask him!
The- first tumult of her resolution'
over, she felt a strange exhilaration.
Even tha thought that intruded Rself
like a specter between them â the pos
sibility that she might have mistaken
his feeling toward her â did not deter
her.
If she were rejected? Well, she
had rejected a number of men in
her day and there would be a certain
poetical justice in his meting out to
her what she had 'meted out to them!
"You might light a cigar if you have
one about you, " she suggested whim
suhllv. "It would be a favor to me
If you would. Men are always more
approachable when they're smoking,
aren't they?"
Askew smiled assent and complied
with her request. Then he paused
with the lighted cigar between his
fingers and gave her a long look, which
she returned unflinchingly. With an
effort 6he began to speak.
"Duncan," the said bravely, "I
huve something to tell you. Perhaps
rot another woman In the world would
do it jind perhaps you'll hate me for
it "
"Hate you!" he interrupted in a
voice whose derisive incredulity was
music to her ears. "Hate you! I can
imagine a good many things, but not
that."
"Well," her voice was slightly un
certain, but her eyes looked into his
without wavering, "you see, there is a
poor rich girl â a girl that has loads of
money and who just hates it because
it is always cutting her off from all
the things â and people she cares
for â "
"Poor thing!" sighed Askew mock
ingly. "What a pity she can't divide
with me!"
"That"s Just what she wants to do!"
leaped from her lips. "She wants to
give it all to you! You see â Iâl'mI â I'm
speaking for her. She isn't in the
habit of saying things â like this â to
men and she doesn't know exactly
how to do it!"
"But she wants you to know that
she thinks you the one man In the
world â that her faith in you is so
great that she even dares to tell you
that â she â loves â you â Donald â be
cause she knows that if she has made
a mistake and you do not care for
her you will be as truthful with her
as she has been with you."
Donald Askew sat as if stupefied,
while the struggle between pride and
love went on within him. To be pointed
out as the maa who married the rich
Miss Vane*â to have it said of him that
he had feathered his nest well â these
and kindred possibilities rose up in his
mind and galled his eplrit beyond en
durance.
Then his vision cleared and he saw
nothing â was conscious of nothing In
the world but a proud, sensitive face
covered with womanly shame. Before
that vision his pride went down, and
leaning forward he burled his face in
her lap. A moment later her lips
touched his hair.
"I'm a brute â a perfect brute!" he
groaned, "to have made you do It!"
"You're the brute I love, though,"
was the whispered answer.
A LIBERAL REWARD
' (Copyright, 1904, by Ethel Barrlngton.)
DEEP in the heart of each man
and woman lies some unfulfilled
ambition toward which his ef
forts tend as a goal. With Myra
Darling it was a gold watch.
Her days were passed behind a
counter where a variety of neckwear
was displayed. The remuneration
was small and served only to provide
her with a "home" and the simplest
of. gowns. The watch for which her
soul hungered might- have been the
moon or the roc's egg. But more try
ing than the privations she endured
was the cheapness, the narrowness of
her life, so different from the gentle
surroundings of her girlhood.
It was her birthday, her eighteenth
year, and Sunday â ay day free from
the aisle-walker's espionage, a happy
combination which Myra enjoyed to
the full. A long afternoon in the
crisp, cool air of the park was a hap
py climax.
It was turning dusk as she left the
park. The city lamps already shone
in a long line down the avenue. On
the side streets the shadows fell black
and ugly, causing a few buildings to
stand out in bold relief. Suddenly a
flash from a passing automobile struck
a small, round object that glittered
near the curbing. Myra bent over to
pick it up. Had some beneficent fairy
godmother thrown the gift at her
feet? It was a watch, and on her
birthday. She seized it rapturously
and looking neither to the right nor
left fled up the steps of her boarding
house, never pausing until Bhe stood
in- the hall room she called her home.
"You little beauty," whispered the
girl, as ehe caressed it with her fin
gers. Then, with woman's curiosity,
Bhe tried to open the back. It was
difficult, but at last Myra gasped with
surprise. The face of a young man,
with honest eyes and kindly mouth,
looked into her own.
She passed her evening rockine
slowly in her chair, with a magazine
between her fingers, the gentle tick
tick of the watch counting the passing
hours. That night Bhe dreamed hot
of the watch, but of a life which the
watch typified, and through the dream
stalked a man whose face was the face
in the watch.
She a\wpke a little after 6 to revel
in the delight of knowing the exact
hour, and turning luxuriously over for
another fifteen minutes.
All day she thought about her won
derful acquisition and smiled happily
to herself. The other girls noticed It

and twitted her in their good-natured
if rather coarse way. Myra laughed,
but guarded her secret, and hurried
home to pass another evening of de
lightful pqssesslon. Three days passed,
and though the watch itself was a
never-failing source of delight, as the
actual realization of her dreams it
was the picture that crept into her
heart. She told her secretÃ to those
honest eyes and called him "dear
friend." He seemed somehow to un
derstand her every whim.
"The whole world could trust you.
andâ l'd trust you absolutely." she
told him one night very softly. "The
other girl trusts you, too? The other
girl! How sorry she must be to lose
your picture."
Then suddenly, without any warn
ing, Myra awoke to the truth. The
watch, the picture were not hers. She
had no right to keep them. She turned
to the window and looked drearily out
over the roofs of houses.
That noon she spent half an hour
running over newspaper files in the
library. She found the description in
the "Lost and Found" column and
made note of the address with eves
grown misty.
*â¢â¢ . â¢ â¢
"Can I see the lady â the one who lost
the watch?" Bhe asked, and was at
once shown into a room with luxurious
appointments. There was a log fire in
the grate, with comfortable louneinsr
chairs and books in every available
space. It carried Myra back to those
other days now dim in her memory.
"You have found my watch? How
glad I am!" The speaker came close
to Myra, with outstretched hands and
eager smile. She was as beautiful as
any of the women whom Myra served
during business hours.
The girl laid the watch In the otb.tr'l
hand. Surely with all Miss Shepherd
possessed she could have spared this
toy, but it was hers and she must have
It.
"It was my mother's." said Miss
Shepherd softly. "That is why I can
not thank you enough. And you will
accept this little acknowledgment?"
she said, trying to press a roll of bills
Into Myra's clenched hand.
"No," said Myra, "it's yoursâ l want
nothing."
"But I promised a liberal reward."
"And I had itâ all the weekâ the
watch was such good company." She
did not mention the picture.
And to all Miss Shepherd's arguments
and entreaties Myra reiterated "No."
The picture held her firm. She could
not take money for that.
In the end she allowed herself to be
persuaded to remain until the rain
ceased and to drink a cup of tea.
"Here's Tom, you must meet him!"
exclaimed her hostess proudly, as the
door swung open and there entered the
original of the photograph.
One look from Myra and then her
lashes drooped in embarrassment. The
others discussed the watch and its re
covery. At first Myra could scarcely
follow what they eaid, but they were
so kind, so full of Interest about her
and her little experiences, that she soon
found herself chatting freely, and
laughing at Tom's funny sayings, still
she rose in trepidation to find how
late it had become.
Tom (ahe had not discovered his
other name) insisted that as his auto
mobile was at the door he would take
her home.
"Oh, no," gasped Myra in distress,
turning to her hostess. "I'd rather
take a car."
"Don't you like motors?" questioned
Mlsa Shepherd kindly.
"I'veâ l've never tried one," admit
ted Mvra.
"Then that settles it." exclaimed
Tom, and Myra found herself hurried
to the door, with Miss Shepherd ex
acting a promise that she would come
again.
"Yes, do!" urged Tom as they went
down the steps. "She really means it.
Isn't she Jolly?"
"She's very kind! How happy she
must beâ so pretty and such a beautiful
home, andâ and you â "
Myra had not meant to say that at
all; it Just slipped out.
"You bet; she's the best sister that
ever a fellow had."
"Your sister?" stammered Myra: and
somehow In her surprise she nearly
missed the step of the motor car. but
Tom caught her.
"Qf course! What else did you
think?"
Myra felt her face flush hotly. She
trembled a little, but she did not say
just what Bhe. thought. In fact, she
did not tell him until the following:
Christmas. Tom had presented Myra
with what had once been the desire
of her heartâ a gold watch.
"I can't take anything so handsome,**
Bhe had said, shaking her head earn
estly.
Tom only laughed. The case flew
back, and there was the one face In
all the world for Myra.
"Sweetheart, I claim a liberal re
i ward," said Tom, "please take me.

young fellow' had' employed his after
noon at the athletic grounds, where
he had been practicing the Jump. He
returned, carrying his Jumping shoes,
which are provided, as you are aware,
with several sharp spikes. As he
passed your window he saw, by
means of his great height, these
proofs upon your table and conjectured
what they were. No harm would have
been done had it not been that, as he
passed your doer, he perceived the key
which had been left by the careless
ness of your servant. A sudden impulse
came over him to enter and see if they
were indeed proofs. It was not a dan
gerous exploit, for he could always
pretend that he had simply looked in to
ask a question.
"Well, when he saw that they were
Indeed the proofs, it was then that he
yielded to temptation. He put his
Bhoes on the table. What was it you
put on that chair near the window?
"Gloves," said the young man-
Holm%s looked triumphantly at Ban
nister. He put his gloves on the
chair and he took the proofs, "sheet by
Bheet, to copy them. He thought the
tutor must return by the main gate,
and that he would see him. As we
know, he came back by the side gate.
Suddenly he, heard him a.t the very
door. There was no possible escape.
He forgot his gloves, but he caught up
his shoes and darted into the bedroom.
You observe that the scratch on that
table is slight at one side, but deepens
in the direction of the bedroom door.
That in itself is enough to show us
that the shoe had been drawn in that
direction and that the .culprit had
taken refuge there. The earth round

Jane's Humbling
Belle Maniates
(Copyright, 1905, by Belle Maniates.)
Ca f>* OME, pa!" commanded Jane
*[ / Tivy in bright, sharp tones.
I l*\ Titus Tivy, a meek, un-
dersized man, responded
to the summons and stood
unresistingly before his daughter while
in accordance with her bi-weekly cus
tom she prepared him for his trip to
town. First she deftly folded a muf
fler about hiÃ neck, buttoned his great
coat snugly over it and then put on
his cap, tying the earlaps in place. She
next handed him the memorandum for
groceries and a letter to mall with in
structions to carry it in his hand all
the way "lest he forget."
When he had taken his seat in the
wagon amid the molassea Jug. kero
sene can and butter crocks, she put a
soapstone at his feet and tucked
about him a heavy blanket shawl in
lieu of a laprobe, albeit the day was
bright and sparkling.
When he had driven away she went
serenely into the house to put the
finiÃhing touches to the toilet of her
sister Rose, a girl of fourteen years.
Hose did not submit to her costuming
as meekly as her father had done. She
pouted at the hanging braids of hair,
bucked against the white apron and
begged for a dip to her blouse. Jane
authoritatively silenced and overruled
these objections and Rose went sul
lenly to school.
For five years, since the death of
her mother, Jane had held a tight rein
over the household, and its members
were strictly under Jane-rule. She was
a woman of convictions; one of them
was that her duty clearly lay in man
aging the affairs of others,. People
were afraid of Jane. They submitted
to' her domineering or avoided it.
There lived a man on an adjoining
farm, however, who was not afraid of
Jane. For some time he had resolved
to introduce her to her true self, and
he had chosen this morning to do it.
"Drop your work, Jane, and sit down.
I want to talk to you."
"Well, Joel, I guess you'll have to
choose some other time for visiting.
I'm no lady of leisure. This Is my
time to work."
"Jane," said Joel with a new, quiet
ring in his voice, "you are going to
listen to me now. I have waited your
convenience Just as long as I am going
to. 7
Jane's nostrils dilated dangerously,
but her heart beat faster than it ever
had before, although she had "kept
company" with Joel for six years.
"I have waited six years for you to
name the day, Jane. If you don't do

It was reasonable to expect to wait
a year or maybe two, but I'll wait no
longer."
Jane was returning to her normal
condition.
"We must wait a year," she decreed.
"The mortgage will be paid then. Rose
will be through school."
"You'll marry me a month from to
day or not at all," he said composedly.
Jane Jumped to her feet.
"Indeed! Well, I am not going to
be forced or threatened by you, Joel
Dixon! I'll not marry you until I see
fit."
"Jane," he replied coolly, "you are
acting under the mistake of thinking
you are necessary to your father and
Rose. They'd get along a great deal
better without youâ or more to their
liking anyway."
Having thas spoken, Joel departed
and Jane returned to the abstracted
washing of dishes^ with new food for
thought.
When her father was unfolding the
"Wingville Weekly" that afternoon,
she astonished him by saying:
"Pa, haven't I managed the house
well and kept up things since ma
died?"
Titus Tivy peered at her over his
spectacles and paper. He did not an

pected.
"Well, Jane!" he finally said. "I

The student had drawn himself erect.
"Yes. sir; it is true-." said he.

"Yes, sir, I have, but the shock of

Soames, which I wrote to you early

Gilchrist pointed to Bannister.
"There is the man who set me In thÂ«

â¢Come now. Bannister, said Holmes.
"It will be clear to you. from what [

"No indeed." said Holmes, heartily,

(The End)
Jane was not satisfied.
"That is not what I mean. Haven't
things been as you liked? I've always
done what I thought was for the
best."
"Why, Jane," he hesitated, **your
way may be the best, but folks don't
always want the best way. They want
their own way."
Jane said no more then, but. when
Rose dame in from school she said
to her:
"Rose, don't you wear the best
clothes of any girl in school?"
"Maybe I do," replied Rose, a little
crossly, "but what's th* pleasure in
good clothes if you can't wear taera as
you want to?"
Again Jane was silenced.
"They say," continued Rose pertly,
"that Joel Dixon's sweet on the new
teacher."
A great fear smote Jane. Then sha
rallied. If Joel Dixon wanted a little,
meek, clinging-vine woman for a wife,
he cculd take Lucy Wicks and wel
come. But Rose's speech rankled and
lingered in her memory through the
week. 'and she anxiously awaited what
Saturday might bring forth.
It brought Joel Just as she wu start
ing her father for town. As Titus gath
ered up the reins Jane intercepted the
exchange of winks between her father
and her lover. This troubled her, and
she was in a puzzled rather than an
antagonistic mood when left alone with
Joel.
"Come with me," he said, tajrin* her
by the arm and marching her out of
the house. Surprised, she suffered her
self to be led or rushed through the
orchard and down the hill to where the
road wound its way.
"Now, stand behind this tree and
watch out," he said.
Wondering If he had gone erasjr, she
did as he directed. She saw her father
drive Jogging Fleetfoot up to a zigzag
corner of the rail fence, get out. take
the soapstone, wrap it in the shawl and
pitch it behind a stump. Then he un
buttoned his coat, threw his muffler un

Intelligence creeping into her eyes.
"Has he â "
"He has. For five years. He knows
what he wants and has had his own
way right along, only he thought it
was easier to let you think you were
having yours."
She turned back toward the house,
Joel accompanying her.
"And has everyone about here known
It?" she asked faintly.
"Tes; they have thought it a good
Joke on you. and they liked your
father too well to give him Â«,way."
She looked so utterly miserable that
he almost but not quite relented.
"No, don't go in the house yet," he
said. "There goes Rose down the road.
When she's out of sight I want you to
follow."
"1 don't need to," replied Jane quiet
ly. "I suppose she stops and remakes)

"Tes, she hides her apron under a

She sat down on the steps.
"Then all these years," she said bit
terly, "I've been a failure and a Joke."
"No, Jane. You have simp!'/ made
the mistake a great many competent
women make â of wanting to boss."
She was silent. Joel thought he saw
an effort to hide a tear and felt en
couraged. He sat dawn beside her and
put his arm about her.
"A month from last Wednesday.
Jane."
She turned her head away.
"Oh. you'd better take Lucy Wicks.
She'd never try to boss you. You need

"No, Jane," he said gently, turning

to return to the old haunts of his youth.
He went down to the river in the great
car.yon, where once hundreds of men
had passed daily along the now desert
ed trails: he revisited long-worked-out
claims and th._- ravine where he him
self Had mined for many years. Often
he passed by the cabin in which he had
lived with his partner, Brand. Its last
tenants had been a couple of China

it wifh some pride as a good house he
liad once helped to build himself, no
â¢ ticing how the great oak tree had
groifc-n in front of it. and that th gar
den fence was still intact, One day he
opened the prate and went in at the
door which the wind had forced ajar,
and i.E it was chilly outside, sat down
,on the old. bedstead to eat his lunch.
In the warm sunshine pouring through
the still glazed windows the place was
â¢a kindly shelter, and he determined to
.C^me again with a hammer and nails
that he might prevent some of the de
cay that threatened it.
Afte^r that he rever passed it with

the oldhause cast a spell upon him.
His middle life, his marriage, his wid
ower day*, Yiis.long service in his stere
at Gold Run â all would be fc-rgotten.
He was young again. The Indian
taint brush flamed along the trails;
the dark pqols of the canyon at which
kve slaked his thirst made him think of
the deep eyes of I woman, shadowed
by her hair. In the dust of the table he

house* he had never built for a woman
he had never wedded. He wc-uld think
of her as though she were still living in
her uncle's home in the leafy garden
at Grass Valley â the Grass Valley of
the sixties. He would recall as though
it. had been yesternight, how he had
'tcjld his partner that he was going to
marry Juanita. the niece of old Mar
tinez. That Brand had never said a
word had rather pleased* than troubled
him, for he was too reserved to care for
comments or congratulations. Again
be woÂ«ld live -with the old happiness
that followed on the promise of his love
to be his wife. He would lose himself in
his ancient dream; then start and look
Â»et the dusty window, remembering how
a trick of sunlight had revealed the
name Juanita 'written there â not by
himself, but by the hand of his part

' ft now seemed to him, the night before.
Suspicions would flare In his breast;
the memory of the grief of his life
would shake him. The charm would
Â«be broken, and he would rise and go
out of the cabin â an old man â iftto
the blazing summer weather of these
days, but into the pearly, softened
lights of the afternoon in fall.
. With the coming of the first rains
Gilbert's excursions ceased and the
cabin was once again completely de
serted. But one night in December
the door opened furtively and admit

to make sure the place was empty lit

west of the railroad, but as he trav
eled In the moonlight he was seized
with bewilderment. Trails once well
marked were almost obliterated; old
landmarks had disappeared; house?
were razed to the ground; .even the
course of the wagon road had changed
as he approached Gilbert's claim, and
he had trembled with the fear of
shelterless age lest the cabin should
be gone like the rest. But when he
had made a fire in the old fireplace he
grew cheerful. The scene of his la
bors had not altered and he would
.work and grow rich Just as he had
done before. He looked out at the
creek,- running sil
ver , among the
chaparral. He
didn't believe the
diggings were
â worked out. At
any. rate he would
find enough gold to
enable him to live
in comfort again.
The flames leaped
â¢ higher. ;" Gold was

the \ hopes of his
youth nickered and
brightened in his
heart. This cabin
was Just as good
as it had ever been
and he forgot thÂ«
signs of change
that had appalled
him on his journey
from the" railroad â
the grass grown
road; deserted
claims and devas^
tat ed homesteads.

preachers of self-abnegation, speaking
only of what the soul must rind within

the lusty, selfish conqueror found
â¢himself only the relic of a , vanished
company. He prospected laboriously,
occasionally finding a few small pieces
in a crevice that had escaped the %
sharp eyes .of the belated China- *
men. but.usually only the richer for
some meager colors after . the day's
work. These he would sell at a store
a few miles up the railroad. The store
at Gold Run was much nearer, but he
never went there because he found
that it was kept by one Gilbert, and
his 'name * - as Brand.

could only make enough to keep body

He was iii led with a longing to look
upon the cue man who was to him the
sole link wiili the past. .'.: last he de
termined to go. to Gilbert's store, half
desiring, hair dreading that Gilbert
should know, him a~ain. It was dusk
when tie!; reached Gold Run and the
presence of half a dozen section hands,
who had come in to make their even
ing purchases, afforded him the op
portunity to shrink into a corner and
look Â«t his o.d partner. He hadn't
altered much. He should have known
him anywhere, moving in his precise
fashion; replying without animation to
the questions. of his customers. At last
the men cleared out together, and he
lit his small - reading lamp, which
served him to make his nightly prepa
rations, for locking up, unaware of the
waiting figure by " the stove. Brand
pulled his hat over his eyes and went
toward him, asking him in a low voice 7
to weigh the gold dust which he held
out to him |In a small â¢ glass bottle.
Tired after the day's work, Gilbert
poured it into his apothecary's scale
with the merest glance at the stranger,
whom he supposed to be one of those
.wastrels who dignify idleness with the
word "prospecting." This indifference
cut Brand to the quick. He pushed
his hat from his forehead and heard
his own voice fill the store as though
it belonged to some one else.
"Gilbert, don't you know me?"
And Gilbert, to his triumph, did
know him. He tremblingly raised the
lamp and they gazed at one anotherâ
the one with the pleading of the re
jected, starving dog, the other off his
guard in his intense surprise. But in
a moment Gilbert turned his ' back,
putting down the lamp and nodding
toward the scale.
It's worth $2," he said { n cold,
even tones, and without waiting, ac
cording to custom, to know what goods
he would take in exchange, he pushed
the money across the counter with a
gesture of dismissal.
Brand stumbled out blindly and sat
down in the shadow of a box car. Gil
bert had not forgotten. He remem
bered only too well, as though forty
years ago were yesterday. Brand re
alized for the first time that he had
hated him because he had taken
Juanita. and he still hated. Crouch
ing behind the car, he watched him
come quietly out, lock his door and
go home toward the house with the
lighted windows. Brand felt a sense
of injustice. His 'heart cried out to,
his old partner, who went by as calm
ly as though all capacity for emotion r
were dead in him, "Don't you remem
ber her eyes? Don't you remember?"
For those eyes seemed to justify
everything. Once looked into -they;
enthralled and possessed with ; their
strange magic. He recalled how on
the night Gilbert had told him he was
going to marry the niece of Martinez
he had seemed to see them pleading
for forgiveness/saying that she would
never have consented but for a mis
understanding.' and he had felt her
flutter like a frightened bird in a
room of open windows. And if he had
been first to soothe those fluttering^
and cage her masterfully, was that his
fault? He hadn't been able to , help
it. There had only been Juanita and
himself in the world!

him so much as the destruction of a
mental picture he had unconsciously
carried with him for many, many
years. Some time after his partner's
disappearance a friend had given him
news of Brand, who, in the parlance
of those days, had "struck it rich."
He had been more than prosperous
and his beautiful wife, whom he
adored, was sparkling in silks and
jewels. And so Gilbert had always
thought of Juanita with the setting
. that belonged to her. wanting for
nothing, relieved from the necessity of
toil, free to move at will on a trium
phal progress through the great cities
of the world. But the pale, ragged
ghost, appearing so suddenly out of
the shadows of his store, destroyed
this imagre like the wraith of a rtorm
shattering the reflected loveliness on
the quiet bo3om of a lake. What had
happened to Juanita? He trembled
as he asked." After the peaceful years
cf homely joys and sorrows he was
filled with poignant anxieties as for
some dear lost child.
Two weeks later, as Brand sat In
his cabin mending his shoes, the door
opened without warning and Gilbert
crossed the threshold, shutting It be
hind him, and mechanically rubbing his
shoes where there should have been
ft mat. Brand looked up. unable to
move or speak, as he came straight
to the fire with the air of an inquisitor.
For a moment he stood erect before
It in a silence that could be felt.
"Why are you here?" he asked, turn-
Ing suddenly.
"I was broke." answered Brand. "I
thought if I came back to the moun
tains â ." He halted, unwilling to re
count his futile expectations.
"But"â returned the other. "I thought
âI was told you'd made it."
"So I did." Brand raised iis eyes
and dropped them again, before the
searching ones that looked down at
him with, it seemed, a very passion to
get at some truth. 'But I lost it all ou
the Comstock in '74."
"In '74: " repeated Gilbert. He
paused as though in search ,of somÂ»
knowledge that he feared, and with
averted faae, moistened his dry lips.
Then he breathed a name, at first
timidly and 3oftly. ttten as a stern
interrogation.
"Juanita?"
"She died." said Brand. "She died
Some of the tense look went out o
Gilbert's face and he sat down on a
empty box near him. He looked at h
old partner and his eyes were Ho
hard any longer â only doubtful am
troubled. Brand understood the
question. He answered it.
"Oh. no. I'd nothing but luck whl
she was alive."
"But maybe," said Gilbert, "therf
was some trouble that kind of worried
her?"
"Trouble!" answered Brand, reassur
ingly. almost gladly. "Juanita didn
know what trouble was. She was as
happy as a bird. Only she seemed t
fade and wilt â the doctors coudn't te
why. I'd money to burn then, but
money couldn't save her. There was
nothing could."
"Nothing could have saved_her!"
bert repeated. "Ay! sometimes they
will go like that. She was happy, you
Brand drew himself up, forgetting
his poverty and rags. "I made her
happy. She had all the pretty things
she liked and baskets of flowers all
the time. I can see her nowâ on her
couch â buried in flowers â smiling out
of them."
Gilbert also saw this picture. â¢ "Sh*
was a flower herself." he said la tones
of relief. You don't want no harm
come to a flower. That was why
helped you to get away," he added a
though to himself.
Brand did not understand this last
remark, but feeling reinstated. hÂ« dre

proudly did the honors of the cabin.
"She was a flower." he echoed a

In his old fashion, and as the sparks
flew upward, smiled to himself think
ing of certain events in the history >f
Juanita's flight that Brand did not
know.
"That night when you took her
away," he said, "I was In the garden,
almost as near as I am to you now."
"When we went from Martinets
place?" asked Brand with a slow effort
of memory.
"Yes, I was there. I lay watching
a long time in the garden. I didnt dare
go in and speak to her for I couldn't
believe she'd forgotten what she'd
promised and I half thongrht the hou
was empty. Then you came along t
lane at the back with horses. A mat
flared at one of the windows. It w^
for you. You came in and went pa
me through the shrubs. As I look
into the house from the veranda I sa
you both."
"Yes," said Brand, and he too r
membered as one remembers a ta
that is told. "I had to go in and he
her find something she had lost on t
stairs. She was always afraid of t
dark."
'Ah. poor thing, poor thing!" sah
Gilbert, thinking of Juanita in th
darkness whence we come and whith
we go.
"I put out the light when we cam
back," said Brand. "I thought I hea
something."
"Yes." returned Gilbert, "a man Is
fine mark in a lighted room," and
smiled his strange smile again.
"And after that." Brand went o
"a few minutes after â there was a sho
â somewhere near the front gate."
"I shot it," said Gilbert. "I met Mar
tinez there. He had heard you we
in town to see Juanita and was mai
to get at you. We went round an<
round in the dark U\te two bulls. Th
I got hold of his revolver and shot
into the ground. I wanted you to get
away."
There was a long silence.
"Her eyes made me mad," said Brand
ones again, and at his partner's nod
of complete understanding he vaguely
comprehended that Gilbert had known
the diviner madness in whirh the de
sire for the welfare of the beloved iÂ«
greater than the instinct of possession.
Gilbert pondered also. If he went into
partnership with Brand again and kept
him supplied with tools and provisions
so that he could go on prospecting the
neighbors would think he had taken
leave of his senses. But that wouldn t
matter. It was worth so much to him
to have the satisfaction of knowing

HELEN DARE
of It is all risr* not a note slurred
or dragged; the watchful youns wo
man with the brown eyes has seen to
that; her enthusiasm has accorded ex
actly* with the score: she hasn't s-.ii'i
much about high notes or low, long
notes or short; the piano has insisted
on them with precision, but she has
opened the minds and touched the
hearts, ai d put that into their sing
ing that only understanding can do.
This is the way the choruses that
sing in the Children's Festival of Song
have been trained by Miss Estelle Car
penter, who is the supervisor of music
for San Francisco's public schools.
No part of the technique has been
sacrificed. The drill on the scales has
been hammered at with persistent in
dustry; the matter of breathing has
been attended to as befits its impor
tance; Jaut always, always Miss Car
penterâthis enthusiastic little woman
who holds the musical training of
more than 50,000 children in her hands
âdemands of the children "What are
you trying to express?"
In drilling them on the scales it is
not a question erf running them merely.
"Suppose," she says, "we are sing
ing without words the story of a little
boy who has no one to take care of
him, who is tired, and lonely and hun
gry, how would ho sing this:
"La, la, la, la, la. la, la, la," runs the
scale in plaintive cadence.
"Suppose," she sees o-n, "the same
little boy has some good fortune hap
pen to him, is suddenly taken into some
one's home to be cared for and loved â "
"Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!"
the vocal ladder is joyously mounted.
It is this qualityâ this sc-ul quality so
rare in children's singing, so very rare
in children's chorusesâ that you will
find in the Children's Festival of Song
at the Mechanics' Pavilion to-morrow
afternoon. < nf

" Just ; the musical teachers. :I ' wanted.

made selections.' from seventy â¢ schools,
one hundred from one . school, v two
hundred v from another, fifty here, one
â hundred and-flfty there, until' we got
together our six thousand singing

two choruses, one, to ' come , from the

side, making the; division in order to
make'it! as easy, Â«3 . possible; to bring'
the children- together for rehearsala
and to' reach them' at their â â â  schools.

possible to give more care to the f sing

.choruses had had to learn air the
songs.
â¢\"ln each chorus of three thousand
..there are twelve- hundred, (sopranos,"
seven hundred altos, five hundred ten

changeable' as the proverbial
moods i.4 \f cmen. They do not,
however, mark the distinguish
ing' individual characteristics as
moods do. for the Simple reason that
they are subject to the stern and un
bending decrees which issue direct
from headquarters in Paris. And who
can tell bat sudden whim or what
passing sentiments rule the destiny of
the robes of millions of women all over
the. civilized world? I say the "civil
ized .jjorld," for the women of Cen
tral' Africa end of tropical islands are
pull wearing the straw waistbands
that have constituted the single and
singular raiment of untold generations
of ancestors, although tapa loth and
garlands are sometime! adepted for
gala days. The women of India. China.
Japan, Madagascar and many . other
places lfke_th?se do not come* under the
yok^e of Parisian dressmakers, but have
thei: own peculiar fashions. In China,
for example, it "is a curious fact that
fashion is more changeable than- in
many other countries. The style of
c hats will often change three times in!
one season, and the colors of the
charming eos;ivnr>s of the women are
continually changing. But In some of
the e countries of -Europe, within hail,
fie it were, of "Paris itself, peasant \vo
me.ri are. still wearing the same pe
culiar and distinctive dress that has
prevailed for thcee or four hundred
years, and in many cases actuality the
came garments are handed down toe
several generations. But no such luck
falls 3 to our lot to-day. Fashion's de
crees are absolute and tyrannical and
must be obeyed without a struggle. Th
present big hat (and its reign now
shows signs of coming to a close) his
to be worn by us all. no matter whether
It becomes our own "peculiar style of
beauty" or.not- It would really be an
interesting study to discover why this
particularly ugly form of headdress
â¢was devised.
It Is a well known fact that some
fashions are made to hide a physical
defect or deformity of royal or nc-ble
dames, but all the same they must be
copied and wornÂ« by . dames whose
forms are symmetrical and free from
blemish. Thus the big sleeveâ
balloon sleeve, as it is called â was
made to hide the. swollen and twisted
arm of a noble fashion-maker .of
France, .but beautiful and shapely
arms are clothed in it now. When the
decree establishing â  . fashion goes
forth, it is inexorable.
One unfortunate feature of fashion's
ordinances is that their periodic
changes are not easy to foretell.* ; It
Is true that the changes are in cycles,
but their periodicity- is of uncertain
duration. Their orbits, so to speak,
are hard to calculate. 'Sudden and
violent changes are expensive and an
noying and have to be met by all sorts
of inventive^ devices that try our souls,
while others, are- more or less .'easy
end within economical resources. And
Fashion- itself has of late years had
to conform to the prevailing senti
ment of equality of. all classes of wom
en. Dress no longer marks distinc
tion of class. The fashions of to-day
must be bo democratic thnt they" can
be worn by all classes alike. It is only
in the material* that any distinction
can be made.
Occasionally fads creepy in. but they
are not recognized _ as fashions," and are
generally ":.-d at except by.the.fad
dists tht-niFelyes. Little 'Isidora Dun

Ical movements meet with little favor
and r. re never recognized at the head
quarters nf fashion. A few associa
tions still sur\ive in England and have
following there that pretend to
retain the natural beauty of the fe
male fvrm in harmonious apparel.
They endeavor in that way to present
an artistic aspect of the subject, but
in reality their chief c-rusade is based
on hygiene. Already the New York
â¢ ians are pushing the crusad?
against tipht lacing, high-heeled or
tisht sh<*s and gcnr.ents that sweep
the street. Their talk and their liter
ature is full of diatribes against mi
en bes. distorted lungs and defective
heart action caused by the garb of
faslion.
How much effect all these efforts will
accomplish cannot easily be guessed.
At any rate I have done enough in only
mentioning them. What we have, to
consider now is the fashion of the day.
its modifications and variations. The
first thing that naturally comes up is
that extremely convenient and com
fortable garment worn by all of us at
all times, the shirt waistâ a garment so
extremely convenient and comfortable
as to have t been adopted to some ex
tent by the tyrant man. I have seen
several men In Boston and New York
clad in shirt waists-. It struck me at
first as very funny, particularly when
I happened to meet in Boston a long
haired man and a short-haired woman,
both dressed in shirt waists and straw
hats. As they were sitting down it was
difficult from a rear view to differen
tia!- the sexes. But this is - only by
the way.
The fact is that the decree has gone
forth that instead of the stiff man
nish shirt waist, that garment must

ment from a doubtful one as well as
the president did. .-'
. Things , were being managed in good
shape ; all around and the bank 1 , was
looking ahead v to fair dividends at the
end of * the year, when Paul Hazzard,
nephew of Aunt Mary, and a young
man of â¢' 22, appeared on the scene.
That , is, he appeared at Aunt Mary's
house, two miles out of town, for a
visit of a month or two. As he, came
from a good family and had just fin
ished at: the university and was about
;to - study for the law, the harshest
critic could have ; found little fault
with him in 1 that ' regard. Aunt Mary :

same time, and so the young man
found himself properly vouched for.
Mr. Leslie appeared to look upon him
with favor, and Kitty was well liked
by Aunt Mary, and thus the love
match started off well. In a month
there was an understanding between
the two. TreeV shrubs and burdocks
grow faster In a country town than in
a big city, and perhaps love does the
same.
Gossip had it that it was all settled
between Paul and Kitty when the
girl's father stepped in to unsettle
things. He had no objections to Paul
on general principles, but he had other
views regarding Kitty. In fact, he
was planning a certain combination of
love and finance. He had his eyes
and ears open, and when he thought
the flirtation had gone far enough
he put his parental foot down. He had
a talk with Paul. He was very nice
about it, but also very firm.
"So Mr. Leslie thinks you are not
good enough, for his daughter, eh?"
Aunt Mary queried when the news
had been broken. "Well, this is not
strictly banking business, but I shall
drop in to-morrow and have a few
words with him. Seems to me his
head is getting too big for his hat."
Aunt Mary dropped in and had a
talk. Mr. Leslie was suave, but he
didn't want Paul Hazzard for a son
in-law, lie said* all sorts of good
things as an offset, but he was firm
on that one point. It wasn't policy
for him to antagonize one of the
largest stockholders in the ba/ik, and
he tried his best to smooth over things
and send Aunt Mary away in friendly
spirit.
"Well, I've seen him," she remarked
on returning home. "If he has bi*
way about things you'll never marry
Kitty."
Paul groaned.
"But he won't hive his way." she
continued. "On the contrary, I'll
have mine. You and Kitty be patient
for a few weeks and there'll either be
a marriage or your Aunt Mary will
admit that she doesn't know rabbits
from woodchucks."
The shares of the First National
were valued at $110, with none for
sale. All men will sell, however, at
a price. That very day Aunt Mary
began hunting up the small stockhold
ers, buying stock and pledging them
to secrecy. She paid fifteen, twenty
and twenty-five bonus, but she got
what she was after. In a month she
had a controlling interest and the
stick was duly transferred on the
books. There was considerable specu
lation as to what was up, but no one
suimised the truth until the first an
nual meeting came around. Aunt
Mary was present and it was noticed
that her jaw was set.
"We will now vote to elect a board
of directors." softly announced the sec
retary when the meeting: had been
called to order.
Aunt Mary had a ticket of her own
be light, graceful and fluffy, made of
thin lawn or linen, daintily embroider
ed by hand, and buttoned In' the back.
Dressmakers are now using to a great
extent medallions of fancy embroidery
and insertions of Irish lace, which
prove to be very popular. A waist is
made to look rich and taking by hand
run tucks. A quite inexpensive waist
may M made of pongee and one can
find exceedingly pretty pongee waists
in the natural colors. One of the de
sirable qualities of natural pongees is
that the light tan colors are in pretty
shades and are generally very becom
ing and. besides that, can safely and
easily be washed. Navy blue pongee
waists will also t>e popular and they
are frequently made with little accord
ion plaits laid all across the front and
on slim figures the effect is certainly
very pretty.
In describing such garments one
must consider the economical aspect of
the subject as well as the fashionable
modes. In fact, almost every girl can
make shirt waists for herself and the
matter of economy is one of her special
considerations. Naturally, good taste
has to be cultivated at the same time,
but it is quite compatible with limited
rssources, and many ycrung ladies pre
fer to be their own dressmakers to
this extent and rely entirely on their
own ideas, both as to color, fit and
cost. They should constantly keep in
rrtind, however, that good material is
much cheaper in the end than poor
material and that any extreme in
fashion may prove to be bad policy, in
view of the frequent modifications of
the fashions of the day. A~s to color,
white is to be most strongly recom
mended, as it does not fade, either in
the sunlight or in the washing, and the
effect is almost always neat and at
tractive. They should also remember
that one means of Increasing the ef
fectiveness of such a waist is to select
appropriate and suitable buttons. In
Paris, imitation turquoise buttons are
used with white lawn or linen waists
and frequently supplemented by blue

is, I shall do so unlessâ â -"
The i pause was dramatic. All had a

Leslie knew that he was in a trap.

with a rather â¢ pale face.

But perhaps â¢ I have said enough on
the subject of shirt waists for the pres
ent. The shirt waist suit naturally
suggests , itself as the next topic for ,
consideration. While the suit of dark
color will no doubt remain popular; yet
the real smart thing this season is cer
tainly going to be of white taffeta. ;' In
the cities -of the East the white linen
suits and white -shoes^present a very
smart and \ attractive appearance, but
they are not often seen in the streets
of . San '- Francisco. But ; you > also * see
lawn dresses in colors, worn with shoes
and parasol â¢ tomach; and the,, effect is
exceedingly" 'striking.' N < : moreVbeau
tiful sight in the way of effective ap
parel can be- seen anywhere - than at
Cambridge on the Harvard class 'da jr. '
The dresses on that important day arÂ«
an inspiration. But the question nat
urally 1 arises. ;Is ! that sort of raiment
possible in San '-Francisco, where it is
quite the common thing to meet wo
men wearing fur capes and tippets In
July and August? Such an anomalous
garb as that at that season of the year
renders a discussion of this subject
seem almost hopeless. Still, such
dresses are no doubt worn in the coun
try in the summer months, but after a
season .in the East and in Paris, one
misses the brightness that this pretty
style of apparel lends to the scene on
the streets or at the country resorts.
These fashions, even if not practicable
in this summer climate of ours, do, how
ever, emphasize the great importance
of the flat that everything must be
made to match, including the street .
slippers, which are now made of all
colors. ; ___
In the matter of sleeves, the elbow,
puff is almost, exclusively worn this
spring. This 2s2 s a big puff, reaching
from ; the shoulders to the elbow ; and -
generally shirred or tucked down the .
middle of the arm. It is confined at thÂ«
elbow by a very deep cuff. These puffs
are worn with gowns for all occasions.
Of course, on the street, long gloves
must be worn, either white or black.
as the dress demands.
Perhaps the best way to bring my
idea of a calling gown fully up to the
requirements of fashion will be to; sub
mit an illustration of one that j. I have
recently seen. It strikingly resembles
the gown worn by Mrs. :C. B. i Alexan
der at V the Barney -wedding In New
York. . The â¢ material is a soft three
toned chameleon moire taffeta, the
colors in it being shades of blue, tan
and cherry i pink. These .three colors
blend charmingly, the tan .being . the -
dominant shade. s The reveres and vest
are of . Valenciennes .lace, with a knot
of blue "silk at the throat, and the but
tons, which are turquoise blue and
very :Frenchy,- make a splendid . finish
for the girdle. The skirt is â  full and
plain, except that there are a few
tucks over the hips and r our ruches,
made of ' the same material.- at the bot
tom. , It' is a "Randwitz" model and
very chic. The hat worn with :it >s ) a

Mingled inextricably in her emotions.
She. knew now why Gordon had" been
in Ravenna that spring day. He had
told ihe truth; it had been with no

t A sudden memory of his words in

force: "By a tie that holds me. and

right to stand here now." Was this
the t?e he had meant? Not the un

what this magazine told of him â were

her name.
CHAPTER XXXIX.
Barriers Burned Away.
Teresa came to her feet with a cry.
Her mingled emotions were yet so re
cent that she had had no time to re
cover pose. Gordon's face was as
strangely moved. Surprise edged it,
but overlapping this was a something
lambent, desirous, summoned by sigh.
of her tears.
la the first swift glimpse, through
the fern fronds, of that agitated form
bent above the fungus, he had noted
thf tokens of returning strength â ami
knew her present grief was from some
cause nearer than the casa in Raven
na. These were not tears of mere
womanly sensibility, called forth by
the lines written there, for a shadow
of nain was still lurking in her eyes.
Was it erief for him? He tossed aside
gloves and riding crop and drew her
to a seat on the warm pine needles
before he F?oke:
"I did not imagine your eyes would
ever see that!"
.She wiped away the telltale drops,
hastily, fueling a guilty relief to think
he had misread them.
"This is an o!d haunt of mine," she
said. "1 loved it when I was a girl â
only a year ago. how long it seems! â
in the convent there!"
He started. The fact explained her
presence tp-day. Shu had known
those walls that hid Allegra! It
seemed to bring them immeasurably
nearer. If he could only tell her!
Reckless, uncaring as she knew a part
of his past had been, could he bear to
show her this concrete evidence of its
dishonor?
Looking up at the pallid comeliness
under its slightly graying hair, Tere
sa was feeling a swift, clairvoyant
sense of the struggle that had kept
him from her.without understanding
all its significance.
"I am glad I came in time." she
continued. "A few days and the
words wff! show no longer. T shall
rot need them then." she went on, her
face tinted. "I shall know them by
heart. As soon as I read the first
lines I knew they were yours â that
you had been hÂ«*re."
"I am stopping at Bologna," he told
her.
"Ah, Madonna!" she said under her
breath. "And you have been so near
Kavenna!"
"Better it were a hundred leagues!"
he exclaimed. "And yet â distant or
near, it is the same. I think of you,
Teresa! That is my punishment.
Every day, as I have ridden through
the pines, every hour as I have Bat
on this hill â and that has been of
ten â I have thought of you!"
"I knew that" â she was gazing past
him to the river and the far dusky
amethyst of the hills â "when I read
what is on the fungus."
Thereafter neither spoke for a mo
ment. A noisy cicala droned from a
near chestnut "bough and from some
where down the slope came the
brooding coo of a wooddove. At
length he said:
"There were tears on your cheek
when I first saw you. They were not
for the verses. I know." .
She shook her head slowly. "It
was something" â she could not ,tell
him all the truth â "something I saw
in that." She pointed to the German
magazine.
He reached and retrieved it. but she
put her hand on his restrainingly.
"Is it about me?"
"Yes," she admitted; "but â "
â¢ May I not see it?"
"Nothing in it really matters," she
entreated. "It could not make any
difference to me â now! Not even if it
were true. Tour past is as if it be
longed to some other person I never
can know. You believe that? Tell me
you do!"
"I do," he responded: "I do!"
"Then do not read it."
"But suopose it is false. Either
way. I would tell you the truth."
"That its junt it." Her fingers
clasped his on the cover. I know
you would. But Ido not believe what
it says! 1 cannot! You can never
have done such things! ' Ah, is it not
enough thut I have had trust? â even,"
she ended hurriedly, "though it would
make no difference?"
His nulses were beating painfully.
He drew her fingers gently from their
hold and opened the magazine to a
page turned down lengthwise. It was
a critique of his drama of "Cain" â
sole fruit of that last year in Ven
ice â which he had himself called a
"drama of madness," and in sheer,
mocking bravado had posted to John
Murray, his publisher. He saw at a
glance that the article was signed with
the name of Germany's greatest mind,
the famous Goethe.
She was trembling. "Remember,"
she said. "I have not asked you! I
should never have asked you!"
Gordon translated the cramped text
with a strange lurid feeling, like com
inj; in touch with an ancient past:
"The character of the author's life
permits with difficulty a just apprecia-.
tion of his genius. Scarcely any one
compassionates with the suffering
which cries out laboriously in his
poems, since it arises from the phan
toms of his own evil acts, which trou
ble him. When a bold and impetuous
youth he stole the affections of a Flor
entine lady of quality. Her husband
discovered the affair and slew his
wife. But the murderer on the next
night was found stabbed in death on
the street, nor was there any one save
the lover on whom it seemed suspicion
could attach. The poet removed
from Florence, but these unhappy
spirits have haunted his whole life
since."
He raised his eyes from the page.
Her face was turned away, her hand
pulling' up the grass-spears in a pa
thetic apprehension.
"Teresa," he said in a smothered
voice; "it is not true. I have never
been in Florence."
"I knew â I knew!" she cried, and
all her soul looked into his. She had
not really credited. But the tangible
allegation . coming at the moment
when her heart was wrenched with
that convent discovery and warped
from its orbid of instinct, had dis
mayed and disconcerted her. The
balm she had lodged for was not
proof, it was only reassurance.
He closed the magazine. The feel
ing that had choked his utterance was
swelling in his throat. For the rest
of the world he cared little, but for
her!
She leaned toward him. her eyes
shining. "I know how you have suf
fered! You have not deserved Int. I
have learned so much, since I saw you
last, of your life in England!"
His tone shook. "Have youlearned
all? That my wife left me in the
night and robbed me of my child?
That society shuts its doors upon me ?
That I was driven from London like a
wild beast â a scapegoat at which any
man might cast a stone?"
THE SAM FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALC.
"Yes," she breathed, "all that, and
more! I have not understood it quite,
for our Italy is so different. Eut you
have helped me understand it now! It
was like this."
She picked up the Bible from where
it had fallen and turned the pages
quickly. "Listen," she said, and be
gan to read:
"And Aaron shall cast lots upon the
two goats â¢ â¢ â¢ But the goat on
which the lot fell to be the scapegoat,
shall be presented alive before the
Lord, to make an atonement with him.
and to let him go for a scapegoat into
the wilderness.
"And Aaron shall lay both his hands
upon the head of the live goat, and
confess over him ail the iniquities of
the children of Israel and all their
transgressions in all their sins, putting
them upon the head of the goat, and
shall send him away by the hand of a
fit man into, the wilderness.
"And the goat shall bear upon him
all their iniquities unto a land not in
habited; and he shall let go the goat
in the wilderness."
He had risen and now stodd raove
lessly before her.
She looked up as she finished. "So
it was with you."
"Yes," he said in a low yoice. "And
so I have lived ever since, a murder
less Cain with a mark on my brow! So
shall I live and die, hated and avoided
by all men!"
"No!" she contradicted, coming to
him. "That will not be! I see fur
ther and clearer than that! It is not
for such an end that you have lived
and written and suffered! But for
something nobler, which th^ world
that hates you now will honor! I see
it! I know H!"
"Stop!" he exclaimed, "I cannot
bear it. lam not a murderer, Teresa,
but all of the past you forgive with
such divine compassion, you do not
know. There is a silence yet to break
which I have kept, a chapter unlovely
to look upon that you have not seen."
"I ask nothing!" she interrupted.
"I must," he went on with dry lips.
"You shall jee it all, to the dregs. In
that convent, Teresa â "
She put a hand over his lips. "You
need not. For â I already know."
He looked in dazed wonder. "You
know? And â you do not condemn?"
"That other woman â do you love
her?"
"No. Teresa. I have not seen her
for two years." â 
"Did she ever love you?"
"Never in her life," he answered,
his face again averted.
Her own was glowing with a strange
light. "Look at me," she said softly.
He turned to her, his eyes â -golden
gray like seaweed glimpsed throgh
deep water â cored with a hungry,
hopeless fire which seemed to trans
form her whole frame to thirsty tin
der.
"Ah," she whispered, "do you think
it could matter, then?"
An overmastering emotion, blent of
bitterness and longing, surged through
him, beating down constraint, blotting
out all else, all that thrilled him find
ing its way into broken speech. In
that moment he forgot himself and the
past, forgot the present and what the
convent heldâ forgot what bound them
bothâ forgot grief and danger. Lon
don and Venice, Annabel, the master
of Casa Guiccioli drew far off. There
was nothing but this fragrant. Italian
forest, this whispering glade above the
blue rushing of the arrowy river, this
sun-drenched afternoon â and Teresa
there beside him. With an impulse
wholly irresistible he caught her to
him, feeling her form sway toward
him with fierce tumultuous gladness.
"Amor mio!" she breathed, and their
lips clung into a kiss.
As she strained back in his embrace,
letting the tide of love ripple over her.
looking up into his face in desperate
joy. something swift and flashing like
a silver swallow darted through the
air.
It suns between themâ a Malay kriss
âand struck Gordon above the heart.
CH AFTER. A.L.
The Oath on the Kriss.
Teresa stood chained with horror â
the cry frozen on her lips. As the sil
ver flash had flown she had seen a
dark, oriental face disappear between
the bracken and had recognized it.
Gordon had shuddered as the blow
struck, then stood perfectly still, his
arms about her. In that instant he
remembered tho scene he had witnessed
at the Ravenna osteria, and his heart
said within him: "Hast thou found
me, O mine enemy?"
Her voice came then in a scream
that woke the place and brought Tita
rushing up the path.
When* he reached them, her fingers
had drawn out the wet blade and were
striving desperately to stanch the
blood with her handkerchief, as, white
to the lips with pain, Gordon leaned
against a tree- After that first cry,
in which her whole being had sounded
its terror, she had not spoken. Now
she turned to Tita, who stood dum
founded.
'Tita, quickly! You and I must help
his lordship to the road. He is wound
ed."
"Teresa" â Gordon sought for words
through the dizziness that was engulf
ing him â "leave me. My horse Is at
the edge of the forest. At Bologna I
shall find a surgeon."
"You cannot ride. It would kill
you. My carriage is near the convent
gate."
He shook his head. "You have
risked enough for me. Titaâ"
"He can bring the horse around,"
she answered. "Come!" She drew
one of Gordon's arms about her shul
der, feeling him waver. "That is
right â so!"
With Tita on the other side they be

fan the descent. She walked certainly
along the difficult path, though every
nerve was thrilling with agony, her
mind-- one Incessant clamor. At the
expense of his own heart he had
stayed away. And this was what
their chance meeting to-day had
brought him. This!
Gordon was breathing hard at the
foot of the hill. He had fought des
perately to retain consciousness, but
a film was clouding his eyes.
'â¢It is only a few steps now," she
said, "to the carriage."
He stopped short.
"You must obey me," she Insisted
wildly. "It is the only way! You
must go to Ravenna!"
"Tlta â bring my horse!"
It was the last stubborn flash of the
will, fainting in physical eclipse. With
the words his hand fell heavily from
her shoulder and Tita caught hiTi in
his arms.
At a sign from Teresa the servant
lifted him into the carriage.
â¢'Home!" she commanded, 'and drive
swiftly."
Through the miles of rapid motion
under the ebon shadows deepening to
twilight she sat chafing Gordon' 3
hands, her eyes, widened with a. great
suspense upon the broadening stain
crimsoning his waistcoat.
In that interminable r ; de her soul
passed through a furnace of trans
formation. The touch of his lips upon
r.eis had been the one deathless in
stant of life's unfolding. In that kiss
she had felt poured out all the vir
ginal freshness of n love renaissant
and complete, no mo-re to be with
hold than a torrent leaping to tho sea.
But the awful instant th:it followed,
with its first glimpse into the hideous
limbo of possibilities, showed her all
else that might lie in that love, of the
irreparable, the disastrous, the in
finitely terrifying. Her marriage had
been a baleful bond of ring and book,
seasoned with hate, empty of sanctity.
His had been sunk somewhere in the
black slough of the past, a stark dead
thing. That they two should love
each other â she had Imagined no fur
ther. She had known her own heart,
but that hour on the hill had been
the complete surety that Gordon loved
her fully in return.
Born of his extremity, there swelled
in her now the wondrous instinct of
the lioners that is i nart of every
woman's love. It lent her its cour
age. All fear, save the one suppress
ing dread that gnawed her heart.
sliDped from her.
Day fell before they reached the
town, and In the ouiet street the
freight of the carriage was not noted.
Before the entrance of Casa Guicciolll
stood her father's chaise.
Count Gamba met her in the hall,
to start at her strained look and at
the pallid face of the man Tita car
ried â a face unknown to him. Paola
was behind him; by this she knew
her husband was returned.
She scarcely heeded her father's
ejaculations. "Bring linen and water
quickly to the large chamber in the
garden wing," she directed, "and send
for Doctor Aglietti. "
Paolo went stealthily to inform
his master.
When Count Guiccioli crossed the
threshold of the candle-lighted room
he came upon a strange scene. Teresa
bent over the bed, her face colorless
as a mask. Her father, opposite, to
whom she had as yet told nothing,
was tying a temporary bandage. Be
tween them lay the inert form of the
man against whom his own morbid
rage had been amassing. His eyes
flared. Where had she found him !
Had Trevanion bungled or betrayed?
Did she guess? And guessing, had
brought him to this house, in
satanic irony, to die before his very
sight?
At the suspicion the fever of his
moody eyes flew to his face. His
countenance became distorted. He
burst upon them with a crackling ex
clamation: "The Venetian dog! who
has dared fetch him here?"
"Zltto!" said Count Gamba pettish
ly. "Don't you see the man is wound
ed?"
or whole, by the body of
Bacchus! He shall go back to-night
to Bologna!" He took a menacing
step forward.
"How did you know he was lodged
there?"
Teresa's steely inquiry stayed him.
She had lifted her face, calm aa a
white moon. He stopped, nonplused.
"You had good reason to know.'
She drew from her belt a Malay kriss,
its blade stained with red. "This is
what struck him. It belonged to you.
Am I to learn what it means to bear
the name of a murderer?"
Her father stared his amazement.
"Dio santissimo!" he exclaimed. Was
this why she had been so pale?
Before her movement her husband
had shrunk involuntarily. "I knew
nothing of it," he said in a> muffled
fury; "I am just come from Faenza."
"I saw whose hand struck the
blow." She spoke with deadly quiet
ness, "h have seen him more than
once under this roof. But whose was
the brain? Who furnished him this
weapon? It was gone from the arras
the day after you brought him to the
casa to be your sicario â to do what
you dared not do yourself! Fool!"
Her voice rose. "Do you think a peer
of England common clay for your
clean-handed bravos? Are English
nobles stabbed abroad without an ac
counting to the last soldo? Do you
suppose no Rortagnan noble ever
went to the fortress with confiscated
estates? Is your reputation so- clean
that if he dies you think to escape
what I shall say?"
A greenish hue had overspread the
fiery sallow of the old Count's face,
ghastly under the candles. She had
touched two vulnerable points at once
â cupidity and fear. Something, too,
in what she said brought a swift un
welcome memory. He recalled an
other â a poet, also â Manzoni, the
Italian, dead by a hired assassin in
Forli years before; in the night some
times still that man's accusing look
came before him. Beads of sweat
started on his forehead.
"Cheeks of the Virgin!" cried Count
Gamba, who had maintained a rigid
silence. "Have you no word to this?"
"He was her lover! She knew where
to find him to-day. It is not the first
time. He was her lover before I mar
ried her."
The other's hands clenched. Tere
sa's accusation had astonished and
shocked him- But as he saw that cow
ering look, speaking its own condem
nation, he credited for the first time
the story of that other slain man.
At this affront, his gaunt, feeble form
straightened with all the dignity and
pride of his race.
Teresa's answer rang with a subtle,
electric energy. "That is false! You
never asked â you only accused. Be
lieving all falsehood of me, you have
made every day of my life In your
house a separate purgatory. I hayÂ«
kept silent thus long, even to my fa
ther. Now I speak before him. Fa
ther." she said with sudden passion.
"he has believed this since my wedding
day. There is scarcely an hour sine*
then that he has not heaped insult and
humiliation upon me. I will bear It
no longer! I have already appealed, to
th? Curia."
Her eyes transfixed her husband
"By the law I may not leave your roof
to nurse this man, so I have brought
him here. What you have believed oÂ£
myself and of him is false. But now.
tt you will hear the truth. I will tell
you! I do love him! I love him as I
'ove my life â and more, the blessed
Virgin knows!â a million times more!"
As she spoke her passion made her
beauty extraordinary. It smote hÂ«r
father with appealing force and with a
pang at his own ambitious part in her
wedding. He had thought of rank and
station, not of her happiness.
"You shall answer to me, Count, for
this!" he said sternly.
â 'No, father!"
Count Gamba looked at her question
ingrly. He faced Count Guiccioli as
Te r esa west on:
"This is what I demand: If he ltvee
he shall stay here till he is well. Not
as a guest; he would accept no hospi
tality from this house- H? shall hold
this wing of the casa under rental."
There was a moment's pause.
â¢So be it." The assent was grudg
ing; and wrathful.
"One thing more. So long as he is
in the casa you will cause him no phys
ical harmâ neither you nor your ser
vants."
While he hesitated a sound came
from the bed tfavdoafa eyes were
open: they held faint but conscious
knowledge.
Frum the abyss of nothingness* those
voices had called to him, like conver
sation in a dream. Sight had opened
more fully and he had stared at the
gilded rafters, puzzled. This was not

With the voices grown articulate, it
came flashing back â that one kiss; the
flying dart of agony: the dizzy descent.
Tita andâ Teresa. He suddenly saw â 
face: the old man at San Lazzarro,
Teresa's husband! He sihut his eyes
to drive away the visions, and hv
clear tones called them wide again.
He heard fully and umWstandinglv
then: knew that Trevanion and Count
Guiccioli had made common cause;
realized the courage with which Tere*i
had brought him to her husband's
casaâ all with a bitter-sweet* pain
of helplessness and protest against the
logic of circumstances that had thrutc
him into the very position that by all
arguments looking; to her ultimate hap
piness he must have avoided. H â¢
heard her voice demand that grudginpr
promise of his safety. It was then he
had moaned â less with physical than
mental pain. B
Teresa leaned to the bed, where Gor
don had lifted himself on his elbow.
The effort dislodged the oandage ami
its edges reddened swiftly. He strove
to speak, but the effort sickened him
and he fell back on the pillows.
Teresa turned again upon Count
Gui<Â«ioli. -Swear it. or all I know-
Ravenna shall know to-morrow!" She
held the kriss toward him. hilt up. like
a Calvary, and half involuntarily his
bent fingers touched his breast.
"I swear " he said in a stifled voice.
"Father.* you hear?"
"I am witness," said Count Gamba
grimly.
.
* CHAPTER XIX
Ashes of Denial.
Day 3 went by. Summer was merg
ing into full-bosomed autumn of tur
quoise heavens, more luscious foliage
and ripening olives.
Gordon's wound had proven deep, but
luckily not too serious, thanks to a
roush fragment of stone in his pocket,
which the surgeon declared had turned
the heavy blade, and which Teresa had
covered with secret kisses and put
carefully away. But to his weakness
from loss of blood a tertian ague had
aided its high temperature, and
strength had been long in returning.
He had hours of delirium when Te
resa and Fletcher â whom Tita had
brought from Bolc-gna with Gordon's
belongingsâ .alternately sat by his bed
side. Sometimes, then, he dictated
strange yet musical stanzas which shÂ«
was able to set down. It was a sub
conscious bubbling up from the sllt
rhoked well of melody within him; a
clouded rivulet, finding an unused way
along turgid channels of fever.
More c-ften Gordon seemed to bÂ«
living again in his old life â with Hob
house in the Greece that he had lovedâ
in London at White's Club with Beau
Brummell, or wit'Â» Sheridan or
Tom Moore at the Cocoa-Tree. At
such times Teresa seemed to compre
hend all his strivings and agonies, and
wept tears of pitr and yearning.
Often, too, he muttered of Annabel
and Ada, and then the fierce jealousy
that had once before come to her as
sailed her anew. It was not a jealousy
now, however, of any one person; it wai
a stifling, passionate resentment of that
past of his into which she could not
enter, lying instinct and alive in some
locked chamber of his brain to defy
and outwit her.
Early in his betterment a subtle in
ducement not to hasten the going hÂ»
knew was inevitable ambushed Gor
don. He found folded in his writing
tablet a six months' leas* of the apart
ments he occupied. The signature
was his own. added, JÂ»e readily
guessed. durttig his fever. The stu
pendous rental with which the old
Count had comforted his cuvetoua soul
was a whet to the temptation. The
thought to which he yielded, however,
was the reflection that to depart with
out showing himself to Ravenna â
whose untraveled gossips had made of
his illness at the casa a topic of inter
eat â would neither conceal the real
situation nor make easier Teresa's po
sition. He prolonged his stay, there
fore, riding with her at the hour of
the corso in the great coach and Â»txÂ«
and later appearing at the conversa
zioni of the vlcelegate's and at the
provincial opera, to hear the "Barber
of Seville" or Alfieri's Filippo."
One day a child in Teresa's car*
rode from* the convent of Bagnaea
vallo to a father whom she had nevesseen, and thereafter Gordon saw with
less kaleidoscopic clearness the walls
of the fool's paradise fate was rear
ing, brick by brick.
. So the long weeks of convalescence
dropped by like falling leaves. In
spite of the constrained oath he had
heard on a certain night in his cham
ber, Gordon more than once wondered
grimly what hour a stiletto might end
it all. That Teresa guarded well, he
realized once with a sudden thrill,
when he opened the door of his bed
room in the night to find Tita's great
form stretched asleep across the
threshold. \ . â¢ - '
Tbe master of the casa, meanwhile,
was seldom to bÂ« seen. When he en
countered Gordon, it was with snarl
ing, satiric courtesy â bitter, armed
armistice. Teresa did not doubt â ? he
had been more than once to Rome,
but what effect his visit might . have
on her petition she could not guess.
" The Contessa Albrizzi was powerful,
but he was an influential factor also.
If her plea were granted, well and
good. If not at least she was happy
now. And because she was happy
now, she thrust away, with a woman's
fatuousness, the thought that there
must come a time when Gordon would
go.
Trevanion . Gordon met but once,
and then with Paolo at the casa en
trance. A single steady look had hung
between them. The other's . eyes shift
ed and he passed, in. Teresa was with
Gordon at the moment and her hand
had -trembled on his arm. She said
nothing, but that night he came upon
Tita in his bedroom, oiling his pocket
pistolsâ he did not wear.
What he had said once as he fought
down the passion of murder in his soul
recurred to him as he laid them away:
"What comes to me thus, I myself
have beckoned. The Great Mechanism
shall have its way." If Trevanion
then had seemed the Nemesis -of
his past, . he seemed doubly so
DOW. The vengeance had fallen
just when the cup of joy was
at his ' lipsâ in ' that one supreme
moment; fate's red reminder that the
moment was not his, but filched from
his own resolve and from Teresa's
peace.
But though he struck not openly,
Gordon was soon to discover that Tre
vanion's hand was unwearied; Shelley
came to him from 'Pisa, bringing re
port of fresh fictions afloat in the Lon
don press: his pasha-like 'residence on
the island of Mitylene, and his roman
tic voyages to Sicily and Ithaca. These,
Gordon heard with a new sting, named
as his companion the ConteEsa Gujcci
oli, who, it was stated in detail, had
been sold to him by her husband- :
Not that Gordon cared, for himself.
Save as they might have power to hurt
her, that kiss on the convent hill,. when
it sweetened the bitterness that had
fallen in that hour, had burned away
the- barb from all such canards. All
that signified was Teresa â from whom
he must soon part-
Parting: that was the sting! Coiled
in it was a realization that In every
conscious moment since that stabbing
thrust in the forest had been rankling,
â with growing pain. It was, that his
own weakness had made withdrawal
from her life ari infinitely cruder thing,
had made his elimination at onÂ« time
less possible and - more necessitous.
That kiss had changed the universe
for them both. For either of them,
bound or free, nothing; could ever be
the same again! :
Sleepless and battling, the night
after Shelley visit. Gordon asked him
self fiercely why, after all, life might
not go on for them still the same. Was
it his fault? Had he created these con
ditions that separated them? What did
either he or she owe this old man who
hated her and had tried to * take his
life? Hereafter would not her existence
alone with him In the casa be a more
Intolerable thing than ever? He, Gor
don, could rob him of nothing he now
possessed or had ever possessed. i Be
sides, in â who could tell how
soon? â changes must inevitably occur.
In the natural course her husband
â would die. Then Teresa would, in truth,
be free. . ,
He paused in his interminable pace
and groaned aloud. What then? For
himself there could be no retracing of
steps. Whatever the issue to him and
to her, he could not go back to Eng
land, invoke the law and free himself.
When he had quitted London lifeâ the
life of wife and â had seemed end
ed. He had thought only of Ada, his
child, when he had. signed that paper
vhjch put it forever out of his power
alone to break the tie which bound him
to Annabel. Between him and Teresa
reared the lawâ a cold, brazen wall be
tween two hearts of fire. "I cannot!" he
said. '.The old tie holds. It Is too late!
Because one woman's pitiless pureness
has ruined me. shall I ruin another
woman's pitying purity?"
So while the dark wore away to dawn
bis* thought began and ended with the
same desolate cry.
As the first light came through , the
windows he blew out the candles. He
must goâ though it shut him again
from sight of AHegraâ though it meant
forever
Gordon Tells a Story.
Gordon threw the window wide.
The sun had broken through the mist,
the lilies were awake in their beds, and
the acacias were shaking the dew
from their solemn harmonies of green
and olive. How eweet the laurel
smelled!
A lonj time he stood then*. At
length he turned into the room. He
collected his smaller belongings for
Fletcher to pack, then drew out a
portmanteau. It was filled with books
arid loose manuscript, gathered by the
valet when he had removed from
Venice.
As he re-read the pages, Gordon
flushed with a sense of shame. Full
of beauty as they were, would Shelley
have written them? Or would Te
resa, -who treasured one book of his
and had loved those simple lines etch
ed on the fungus, read these with like
approval?
An aching dissatisfaction â a flerr
recrudescent distaste seized him. He
rolled the leaves together and de
scended to the garden. At the base of
a stone sun-dial he set the roll fun
nel-shape and knelt to strike a light.
He had not seen Teresa nor heard
her approach till she caught h<B arm.
"What is it you burn ?" she asked.
"The beginning of a poem I wrote
a long time ago. named 'Don Juan.' "
"May I read it first?"
He shook hiÂ« head. "It is not
worthy."
She looked at him aerlously, Â«tr!v
lng to translate his thought, and with
a sudden Impulse stooped and picked
up the roll. "Do not destroy It," shÂ«
said; "one day you will finish It â more
worthily."
CHAPTER XLJI.
He hesitated a moment, then thrust
the manuscript into his pocket and
followed her to the bench where they
had sat the night Tita had led him
to the columned gate, and how many
gilded days since! With what words
should he tell her what he must gay?
He saw that she held in her hand a
small rough fragment of stone.
"What is that?" he questioned, try
ing to speak lightly. "A jewel?"
A change passed over her face and
she raised the stone to her lips. "Yes,"
she answered; "do you not recognize
It?"
As he looked at it curiously, she
added: "It was in your pocket that day
on the convent hill. You never missed
it, did you? The kriss" â she shuddered
as she spoke â "struck it. See â here is
the mark. It saved your life."
Wondering, he took it from her
hand. "Strange!" he said, as he
handed It ba^ck. "It is a piece of the
tomb of Juliet which I got long ago
In Verona."
"Juliet?" she repeated, and dropped
the stone on the bench between them,
coloring. "Did you â care for her?"
The feminine touch in tone and ges
ture brought Gordon at one time a
smile and a pang. It had not occurred
to him .that Shakespeare could be un
known to her. "All Englishmen love
her," he said gravely; "she was one of
the great lovers of the world. She died
500 years ago."
Her face flushed more deeply now.
"Will you tell me about her?"
Sitting there, the revelation of the
early morning enfolding them, he told
her the undying story of those tragic
loves and deaths that the great Anglo-
Saxon gave to all ages.
"There were two noble families in
Verona," he began, "who for genera
tions had been at enmity â the Capulets
and the Montagues. Juliet was the
daughter of Lord Capulet. She was so
lÂ»eautiful her fame went throughout the
country. Romeo, scion of the house of
Montague, heard of her beauty, and to
see it went masked to a fete given
her father. Among the Veronese ladles
he saw one who shone amid the splen
dor like a jewel in an Ethion's ear.
They danced together and he kissed her
hand. Not till they parted did either
know the other was an enemy. That
night Romeo, unable to stay away from
the house where he had left his heart,
scaled the wall of its garden and they
plighted troth upon her balcony. Next
day they were secretly married by a
monk whom Romeo had prevailed
upon.
"There had been one, however, who,
beneath his mask, recognized the unin
vited gru^st â a nei)he\v of Lord Capulet
himself. He kept silence then, but the
day of the marriage he met Romeo,
forced a quarrel and was killed by him.
For this Romeo was sentenced to ban
ishment. That night he gained Juliet's,
chamber from the garden. Only these
few hours were theirs; at dawn he tied
to Mantua, till the monk could make
public their marriage.
"Lord Capulft meanwhile had select
ed another for Juliet's husband and
bade her prepare for the nuptials. She
dared not tell the truth and in her ex
tremity appealed to the monk. He
counseled her to consent to her father's
plans, and on the night before the mar
riage to drink the contents of a phial
h? save her. The potion, he told her,
would cause a death-like trance, in
which apparently lifeless state she
would be laid In the family vault.
Thither he would bring Romeo in the
night and she should awaken in his
arms."
Teresa's eyes had grown brighter.
The lovers' meeting among the mask
ers, the garden trothlng and the con
strained marriage seemed somehow to
fit her own case. She leaned forward as
he paused. "And she took the potion?"
"Yes. Love and despair gave her
courage. It happened partly as the
monk had said. But, unluckily, the
news that Juliet was dead traveled to
Mantua faster than hie letters. Romeo
heard, and heart-broken came to Ve
rona at midnight, broke open her tomb
and swallowed poison by her side. A
few momenta later she awoke, saw the
cup in his hand and guessing how it
had befallen unsheathed the dagger he
wore and died also by her own hand.
So the monk found them, and over
their bodies the lords of Capulet and
Montague healed the feud of their
houses."
The bruised petals of a rose Teresa
had plu< ked fluttered down. "How she
loved him!" she said softly.
He remembered that among the
volumes in the portmanteau he had
opened had been the "Romeo and
Juliet." which he had put into his
pocket the night he left England. "I
have the book." he said, rising; "I
will give it to you."
He went back under the flowering
trees to fetch it. "This one hour." his
heart was repeating; "this last hour!
Then 1 will tell her.*
He was gorft but a few moments.
When he came down the stair she
#U in the hall. He paused, for a
man who had just dismounted at the
iasa entrance stood before her. Gor
uon caw Teresa sink to her knees,
saw the other^make the sign above
her h<?ad as he handed her a letter,
naw him mount and ride away; saw
her read and crush it to her breast.
What did it mean? The man hud
worn the uniform of nuncio of the
papal see. Had the Contessa Albrizzi
succeeded?
Teresa turned from the entrance
and saw h>m.
"Here is the book," he said.
She took it blankly. Suddenly nh<Â»
thrust the letter into his hands. "Read
it," she whispered.
It was the Pope's decree. Teresa
was free, if not from the priestly
bond, at least so far as actions went.
Free to leave Casa Guiccioli and to
live under her father's roof â free as
the law of the church and land could
make her. But that was not all. The
decree had its conditions and one of
these contained his own name. She
was to see him only once each month
between noon and sunset.
Such was Count Guiccioli's sop
from Rome.
As Gordon read he felt a dull an
ger nt the assumption that had cou
pled his name with hers in that doc
ument. Yet underneath he was con
scious of a painful relief; fate 'had
partially solved the problem for them.
He raised his eyes as a sob came from
Teresa's lips.
She had not thought of possible
conditions. A month â how swiftly the
last had flown! â seemed suddenly an
infinity. She had longed for that mes
sage, prayed for it; now she hated it.
Another figure entered at that in
stant from the street. It was Tita,
just from her father's villa. Count
Gamba had been less well of late and
now the messenger's face held an anx
iety that struck through her own
grief.
The news was toon told. HÂ«r father
had had a syncope at daybreak and
the doctor was then with him.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
; Tita did not tell her the whole; she
did not learn till she reached the villa
that Count Gamba, suspected of fo
menting the revolution, had received
notice from the Government to quit
i Romagna within ten days.
CHAPTER XLIII.
One Golden Hour.
"To-dayâto-day!" Teresa's heart
said. "To-day he will come."
Just a month ago she had left Caea
GuiccioM forever; now she eat in the
fountalned garden of the Gamba villa,
a few miles from Ravenna, rose-pale,
cypress-slender, her wanness accentu
ated by the black gown she wore â the
habit of mourning. The sentence of
exile against Count Gamba had never
been carried out; a greater than Aus
tria had intervened. Since that morn
ing when a servant, had found him un
conscious among the cold retorts of his
laboratory, clasping the decree that
had broken hie heart, he had revived,
but only to fail again. The end had
come soon. A week ago Teresa had
followed him to the narrow home over
â whjch no earthly power claimed juris
diction.
As the sat, drenched wjth the attar,
of the Sentember afternoon, in her lap
the "Romeo and Juliet" which Gordon
had given her on their last meeting,
gladness crept goldcnly through her
grief. The book had lain on the arbor
bench during the night, and this morn
in? bhe had found a letter written on
its blank page. For the hundredth time
she perused it now:
"I have found this book in your gar
den and reread it in' the moonlight.
You were absent, or I could not have
done so. Others would understand these
words if I wrote them in Italian, but
you will interpret them in English. You
'will recognize, too, the handwriting of
one who loves you and will divjne that
aver any book of yours he can think
only of that fact. In that word, beau
tiful in all languages, but most so in
yourâ amcT mioâ is comprised my ex
istence here and hereaft<*r. My destiny
has rested with you, and you are a
woman, nineteen yearsNof age, and but
two out of a convent. Fate has sepa
rated us, but to weigh this is now too
late. 1 love you and cannot cease to
luve you. Will you think of me if the
Alps and the ocean divide us? Ah â but
they never can unless you wish it."
This, letter had been wrung from him
by the thought of the loss and loneli
ness in which he could not comfort her;
beneath its few words lay the strain
and longing of the old struggle. He had
told himself at first that her separation
could make no difference with his go
ing. But now she was alone, bereft,
saddened. If he went, could she love
him any the Ipss? So he had wrestled
as Jacob wrestled with the angel.
As Teresa read, a moving shadow fell
cm the page. She looked up to see him
coming between the clipped yew
hedges. In another moment he had
caught her hands in his.
"How you have suffered!" he said,
his gaze searching her face, to which
a glad flush had leaped.
She framed his head in her arms, just
touching his strong brown curling
hair with its slender threads of
gray. "I knew you caved. I knew you
had been near, me often. I found the
flowersâ and this note."
I havo been here in the garden every
right. I was here (hat one night, tooâ
when yÂ«.u were first alone."
Tears gathered In her eyes.
"It was the decree of exile that killed
him," she said slowly. "He loved Italy
and hoped for what can never be. They
say the uprising in the north has failed
and all its chiefs are betrayed. Thut is
the bitterness of It; it was for nothing
after all that he died! Italy will not
be free. You believe it cannot, I know."
'Some time," he answered gently.
"But not soon. Italy's peasants are not
fighting men like the Greeks; they lack
the inspiration of history. But no man
champions a great cause in vain. And
nuw," he asked, changing the subject,
"what shall we do?"
"I have sent the news to my brother,
Pietro. Cavadja has lost his princi
pality and Prince Mavrocordato is in
flight from Wallachia. Pietro is with
him. My, letter must find and bring
him soon. Till then I have Elsieâ she
was my nurse. I shall be glad' when
Pietro comes. How long it seems since
1 have seen him! He would not know
me now. He has only my convent
miniature to remind him!"
Gordon's thought fled back to a day
when he had swum for the brother's
life and found that pictured ivory. Fate
had played an intricate game. He
would more than once -have told her
of that incident but for another hound
ing memoryâ the recollection of the
mad fit of rage in which he had ground
the miniature under his heel. He could
not tell her that!
"I know why you have stayed en at
the casa," she said; "that it is for my
sake, to spare me idle tongues. Yet I
have been so afraid for you. You would
never go armed!"
"I am in small danger," he smiled.
"Fletcher, and Tita, whom y v left me
for bodyguard, watch zealously. One
br the other is always under foot. One
would think I were AM Pasha himself."
He spoke half humorously, trying to
coax the smile back to her lips. He
did not tell her with what danger and
annoyances his days had been filled;
thai police spies, in \vhose assiduity he
recognized the work of her husband
and Trcvanion, shadowed his foot
steps; that to excite attempts at his
assassination the belief had even been
disseminated that he was in league
with the Austrians. Nor did he tell her
that this very morning Fletcher had
found posted In the open marketplace
a proclamation too evidently inspired
by secret service agents denouncing
him as an enemy to the morals, the
literature and the politics of Italy.
He had long ago cautioned Tita against
carrying her news of these things.
As they strolled among the dahlias,
straight and tall as the oleanders in
the river beds of Greece, she told him
of her father's last hours and her life
in the villa, brightened only by Tita's
daily visits from the casa.
"What have you been writing?" she
questioned. "Has it been "Don Juan?' "
He shook his head. The hope she had
expressed â that he would some day fin
ish it mere worthilyâ had clung to him
like ivy. With an Instinct having its root
deeper than his innate hatred of hy
pocrisy, he hud forwarded the earlier
cantos whose burning ehe had pre
vented to John Murray in London for
publication. This instinct was not
kin to the /bravado with which he had
sent "Cain" from Venice; it was a
crude but growing prescience that
he must one day stand before the
world by all he had written and that
the destruction even of its darker
pages would mutilate hla life's vol
ume. But he had not yet continued
the poem. Thinking of this he sighed
before he asked her:
"Have you read all the books I
sent?"
"Many of them. But I liked this"
. â Bn e touched the "Romeo and Ju
t llet" â '"most of all."
"It -Is scarce a tale for sad hours.'
I he said, laying his hand over hers or
â  the slim leather.
Her fingers crept into his as she
went on earnestly: "The stone brought
from Verona makes it seem so true!
Do you suppose it really happened
so? What, do you think was the po
tion the monk gave her? "
"A drachm of mandragora, perhaps.
That is said to produce the cataleptic
trance. I wish Juliet's monk mixed
his draughts in Ravenna now," he add
ed with a touch of bitterness; "I shall
often long for such a nepenthe before
the next moon, Teresa."
He felt her fingers quiver. The
thought of the coming J\ongl month
shook her heart. "You will go from
Ravenna before that," she whispered,
"shall you not?"
"From the casa, perhaps. Not
from near you. The day you left
Casa Guiccioli I had made up my
mind to leave Italy. But now â now
â the only thing I can see certainly is
that I cannot go yet. Not till the
skies are brighter for you."
"Can they ever be brighter â if you
go?"
"You must not tempt me beyond
my strength," he answered, a dumb
pain on his lips. "Ah, forgive me! I
did not mean â "
â¢"Tempt you! Have I done that?"
"It is my own heart tempts me 1 â
not yoj! It is that I cannot trust!"
"I can trust it," she said under her
breath. Her eyes were luminous and
tender. "It is all I have .to trust
now."
His strength was melting- He
would have taken her into his arms,
but the neigh of his tethered horse
and a familiar answering whinny
came across the yews.
"It is Fletcher," he said in sur
prise. He crossed the garden to meet
him. â¢
"What is it, Fletcher?" he demand
ed. "Why have you left the rooms?"
"My lord," stammered the valet,
"did you not send for me?"
"No."
Fletcher looked crestfallen.
"Who gave you such a message?"
"Count Guiccioli's secretary, your
lordship."
A disquieting apprehension touched
-Gordon's mind. Why had Paolo sent
the servant on this sleeveless errand
unless he were wished out of the
â way? He remembered a packet
which Count Gamba, weeks before,
had entrusted to him for safe-keep
ing. At the time Gordon had. sus
pected its contents had to do with
the Carbonari's plans. This packet
was in his apartments. Found, might
it inculpate the dead man's friends in
that lost cause?
He rejoined Teresa with a hasty ex
cuse for his return to the casa.
"You will come back?" She question
ed with sudden vague foreboding.
"Yes, before sunset."
"Promise me â promise me!"
For one reassuring moment he put
his arm about her, aching to fold her
from all the world. The past for them
both was a grim mirage, the future a
blind dilemmaâ nay, there wa? no fu
ture save ac It gloomed, a presrnant
shadow of this present so wrought of
doubt and joy.
CHAPTER XIJV.
By Order of the Pope.
Nearing the Casa Guiccioli, Gordon
saw a crowd clustering a few paces
from the entrance. Servants were
watching (from the balcony.
A couple of soldiers cocked their guns
and would have hindered him, but he
put them aside. On the pavement lay
a man in uniform, shot through the
breast. Over him bent a beardless ad
jutant feeling for a pulse, and a priest
muttering a horrified prayer.
He asked a hurried question or two
amid the confusion and dismay. The
prostrate man was the military com
mandant of Ravenna. No one knew
whence the shot had come a full twenty
minures before. Now his guard stood,
with characteristic Italian helplessness,
doing nothing, waiting orders from
they knew not whom or where.
Guidon spoke authoritatively f& the
subaltern, bade one of the soidlers go
for the police, dispatched another, with
the news to the Cardinal and directed
two of the crowd to lift the injured
man and carry him to Ms own quar
ters in the casa. This done he sent
Fletcher for the surgeon who had at
lendtd his own wound in that same
chamber, and stationed the remaining
soldiers at the lower doors. When the
room was cleared he gave his attention
to the unconscious commandant.
He stood a moment looking fixedly at
the bed. It was this man's spies who
had dogged him during the past month,
persecuted his servants and attempted
to raise the Ravennese against his very
presence in the city. The government
he served would have rejoiced to see
him, Guidon, lying stretched there in
the other's place; would have given but
lukewarm pursuit to the assassin. Yet
the man before him lay helpless enough
now. Presently the casa would be full
of soldiers, dragoons, priests and all
the human paraphernalia of autocratic
authority. Who had fired the shot?
And by what strange chance, almost at
his own threshold?
Hft crossed the floor, unlocked a
drawer and touk out Count (Jamba's
packet with satisfaction. His foot
struck something on the lioor.
He picked it up. It was a small leath
er letter case â evidently fallen from the
pocket of the wounded commandant.
He took a step toward the l>ed, intend
ing to replace it, and saw Tita at the
door.
The latter wore no coat. He was
sweaty and covered with dust. He
beckoned Gordon into the next room.
"Excellence," he asked huskily, "will
you not open that portafogli?"
"Why?"
"Perhaps to know what he knew."
"Why should I wish to know?"
"Because he was on his way here â to
this casa, Excellence."
Gordon saw that he was trembling, it
seemed with both fatigue and repressed
excitement. "Tell me what you know,"
he said.
Tita spoke rapidly, his words tum
bling one against another:
"I heard Paolo send your valet after
you to-day. Excellence, when no one
had come from the villa. It did not
seem right. I watched from the garden.
I could Eec some one in this roomâ it
was locked when you went. I climbed
a tret. The master and one otherâ"
"Tjpvtrnion!"
"â T could not tell. They were carry
ing Jh boxes. When they left the casa
I got through the window and broke
them open- They held bullets and cans
of powder."
Gordon swept a swift glance around
the room. He was beginning to under
stand. Ammunition, presumably for
the use of the Insurrectionists, here in
- his rooms â evidence of complicity wltl
'- the carbonari. A military search at th

CHAPTER XLV.
The Summons.
Seated amid the dahlias, Teresa,
from speculation as to what had re
called Gordon to the casa, drifted into
a long day-dream from which a sud
den sound awoke her.
Several troopers passed along the
roudway; following were two closed
carriages. While she listened thu
wheels seemed to stop.
"It is the moth - superior come frc-m
Bagnacavello," she thought. As she
sprang up, she heard old Elise calling.
Slipping; the "Romeo and Juliet" into
her pocket, she went hastily into the
house.
Five minutes later she stood dumb
and white before three persons in the
villa parlor. Two were nuns wearing
the chess of the order of St. Ursula.
The other she had recognizedâ he had
visited her father in his illness â as
chaplain to the Cardinal of Ravenna.
A letter bearing' the papal arms, drop
ped from her hand, lay at her feet.
What it contained but one other In
Ravenna besides the cardinal knew;
that was the military commandant who
had furnished the ecclesiastic hU es
cort of troopers disposed outside the
villa, and who at that moment was
walking on another erand, straight to
ward a musket, filed half down, wait
ing on a casa roof.
"Wo must start without delay, Coa
tespa." The clerical's voice fell half
compassionately. "The villa and its
servants remain at present under the
vicp-l?gate's care. By direction, noth
ing may be taken with you save suita
blu apparel for the journey. We go
only as far as Forli to-night."
Teresa scarcely heard. Haste â
vhetl such a little time before she had
bfen so happy! Haste â to bid fare
well now to the world that held him?
In her father's death she had met the
surpassing but natural misfortune of
bereavement. This new blow brought
a terror without presage or precedent,
that seemed to grip her every sense.
The convent of Saint Ursula! Not a
home surh as she had known at Bag
nacavallo, a free abode of benighted
phantom-footed monitors, but a forced
retreat, a prison, secret and impreg
nable.
What could she do? What could she
do? The question pealed in her brain
as she answered dully, conscious all
the time of a stinging sense of detail;
the chaplain facing her; the silent re
ligieuses beside him: the wrinkled face
oi Elist* peering curiously from the
ha/1; out of doors goldenlng sunlight,
men's voices conversing and the
stamping of horses' hoofs. Not even to
see himâ to teil him!
As she climbed the stair mechani
cally, a kind of dazed sickness in her
limbs, she pictured Gordon's return
ing at thi' hour's end to find her gone
forever. She Â»at down, her hands
clenched, the nails striking purple cres
cents in the palms, striving desper
ately to think. If she could escape.
She ran to the window â a trooper
stood smoking a short pipe at the
rear of the villa. She went to the
staircase and called, "Elise!"
A nun ascended the stair. "The ser
vants are receiving his Eminence's
instructions," she explained. "Pray
let me help you."
Teresa began to tremble. She
thanked her with an effort and auto
matically set about selecting a few ar
ticles of clothing. The apathy of hope
lessness was upon her.
The chaplain stood at the foot of
the stair when they descended. See
ing him waiting, the sharper pain re
swept her. Only to bridge that time
â to see Gordon again, if but for an
instant, before she went. She stopped,
searching his face.
"1 should like a little while alone
before I go. There is time for that,
is there not?"
His grave face lighted, the authori
tative merged Instantly in the fatherly
solicitude of the shepherd of souls.
i He thought she longed for thÂ« su
s preme consolation of prayer.
i "A half -hour i.f you wish it, my
daughter. ThÂ« chapel â shall It not
be?" He led th* way. Elise sat
. weeping in a chair; as they passed
j she snatched Teresa's hand and kissed
- It silently.
[ From the side steps a tunneled yew
[ walk curved to a door In one of the
villa's narrow wings. This wing,
r which had no connection with the rest
, of the house, had been added by*
Count Gamba as a chapel for Teresa's
1 mother. It was scrupulously kept,
[ and during all the years since her
death bowls of fresh flowers had
[ scented It daily and two candles had
been kept burning before the crucifix
| over 'ts cushioned altar. The attic
, above Count Gamba had used as a
, laboratory for his unending chemical
experiment*. Jt was there the mes
, sage had found him which had
brought so cruel a result.
i The churchman paused at the
chapel door and Teresa entered alone.
He closed it behind her.
CHAPTER XLVL,
The Potion.
The declining sun shone dimly
through the painted windows. The
chapel was in half-dark. Teresa went
slowly to where the two candles winked
yellowly. She had often knelt there,
but she brought now no thought of
prayer. Might Gordon come in time?
"Would his errand at the casa delay
him? Could fate will that she should
miss him by such a narrow margin?
She crouched suddenly down on the al
tar cushions, dry, tearless sobs tearing
at her throat.
She felt the book in her pocket and
drew it out.
Only that morning she had fo-und the
letter written in it â only an hour ago
their hands had touched together on
jts cover. How truly now Juliet's plight
seemed like her own! But she. alas!
had no friendly monk nor magic elixir.
There were no such potions nowadays.
What was it Gordon had said? Man
dragora â a drachm of mandragora? If
she only had some now!
She caught her breath.
In another minute she was stumbling
up the narrow curling stair to the loft
above.
Ten minutes later she stood in the
center of the laboratory, lined with its
shelves of crooked- necked retorts and
bottles, her search ended, the blood
shrinking from her heart, her hand
clutching the small phial.
Gasping, she seized a slender grad
uated glass and hurried down. ShÂ«
ran to the chapel door and fastened it,
hearing while she slid the bolt thÂ»
steps of the cleric pacing up and down
without.
As she stood again at the altar, the
phial in her hartal a bleak fear crossed
her soul. What if it had never been
anything but a story? Perhaps Juliet
had never awakened really, but had
died when she drank the potion! Sup
pose It were poison, from which there
was no awakening!
She shivered a3 if with cold. Better
even that than life â without him!
Perhaps, too, Gordon had Jested or
had b n mistaken. It might have
been some other drug â some other
quantity.
Another dread leaped upon her out
of the shadow. Suppose it were the
right drug â that its effect would be as
he had said. What then? In her
agony she had thought only of escape
from the hour's dilemma. There would
be an afterward. And who would know
she only slept? She dared not trust
to Elise â her fright would betray her.
She dared not leave a writing lest other
eyes than Gordon's should see and
understand. Suppose she did it. and
succeeded, and he came afterward. He
would deem her dead in truth â that
was what Romeo had thoughtâ a vic
tim of her ovn despair. They would
bear her to the Gamba vault cold and
coffined, to wake beside her father,
without Juliet's hope of rescue. Her
brain rocked with hysterical terror.
If Gordon only knew she would
dare all â dare that worst. But how
could ehe let him know? Even if he
were here now ehe would have neither
tmie nor opportunity. Her half-hour of
grace was almost up.
Yetâ if he saw her lying there, ap
parently lifeless, and beside her that
bo'.k and phial â -would he remember
what he had said? Would he guess?
Oh, God, would he?
A warning knock sounded at the
chapel door.
"Blessed Virgin, help me!" whispered
Teresa, poured the drachm and drank
It.
Then, with a sob she stretched herself
on the altar cushions and laid the
"Romeo and Juliet" open on her br
When finally â his wonder and indig
nation having given place to apprehen
sion â the chaplain employed a dra
goon's stout shoulder to force the chap
el door, he distinguished at first only
emptiness.
He approached the altar, to start
back with an exclamation of dismay
at what he saw stretched in the candle
light.
He laid a faltering hand on Teresa's:
It was already chilled. He raised her
eyelid â the pupil was expanded to the
iris' edge. He felt her pulse, her heart.
Both were still. A cry of horror broke
from his lips as he saw a vial lying un
corked beside her. He plcfted It up.
noting the far-faint halitus of the dead
ly elixir.
His cry brought Elise. with the nuns
behind her. The old woman pushed
past the peering trooper and rushed to
throw herself beside the altar with a
wail of lamentation.
The chaplain lifted her and drew her
away.
"Go back to the house," he bade her
sternly; "let no servant enter here till
word comeg from Casa Guiccioli." He
waved the black-gowned figures back
to the threshold. "She is self-slain, " he
said.
In the confusion none of them had
seen a man enter the garden from the
side. who. hearing the first plarm. had
swiftly approached the chapel. No one
had seen him enter the open door be
hind them.
The churchman, with that solemn
pronouncement on his lips, stopped
short at Gordon's white, awe-frosted
face. There was not true sight, but
rather a woeful, congealed vision in
those eyea turned upon the altar; they
seemed those of a soul in whom the
abrupt certainty of perdition has
sheathed Itself unaware*.
The chaplain drew back. He recog
nised the man who had come so sud
denly to meet that scene. A dark
shadow crossed hi* face. Then mutter
ing a prayer he followed the nuns ta
the carriages to bear back the melan
choly news to Ravenna,

"hut well to ask 'a* favor of the cashier
on such a Tuesday.''
0 Bob turned up at the bank on Tues
day. July, the sth, and his reception
would have disheartened a person lack
ing as tough an integument. As it was,
Bob didn't seem to ' realize he had been '
turned down. Mr. Martin. theVcashier/
had his coat off and both hands work-.
Ing like an electric fan in a mass of
filthy bills which Uncle Sam , should
have redeemed and turned into papier
mache hats and vases. long ago. The
day was unseasonably warm, and the
cashier's collar; slapped limp and gluey
upon his apoplectic neck. '
At intervals he turned his head away
and .said something not meant for the
teller's ears: Â«while he sprinkled the
reeking mass with rosewater ..- from a
bottle on the counter. Most of the bills
had been dragged from deep pockets by
members in the thirty-third degree, of
the great unwashed fraternity, and, as
the caÂ«hier " had reroarsea, they car
ried ewe hundred scents to the dollar.
But that . waÂ« ' on a previous occasion.
There was no time for any such levity
on Tuesday. July 5.
"Please, sir, I'm lookin' for a job." -
We : all heard it, but its origin , was
rot immediately apparent. The. cashier
continued . counting - dirty bills.; Mr.
Harvey, the teller, glanced at the cash
ier and returned to hie books. Tom,
who was , "on ' the ledger,", paused with
a check in tiis fingers and his pen on
the line, took one' swift, look in , the
direction of - the - sound, evidently < saw ;

formed . us that if we .wanted anything
to eat that' night before we caved in we
had better: "hit it up pretty lively." .
"Mister, I say. rm'lookin' for a job."
TJÂ»is time we â all ; stopped. .- supper or
no supper. The cashier-looked' up an
grily and beheld a. small boy, not over
wasfied,* villainously red-headed, and,
Judging from the age of his face; stunt- 1
ed Is his growth. > His l ; eyes - did r not â¢
me level < f the counter. It was
4, and the doors had been locked
tor an hour. He must have aifclved via
the window.
"I'd Hke to run your errands," I*he1 * he elu
cidated pleasantly.
"We have no place for you," said the
caslmr shortly, and in a tone which
made further conversation on the sub
ject ludicrous.
The boy retreated to the window ar.d
sat down on the sill. At 5 he was still
there. He didn't even whistle. He sim
ply stayed with us. his eyes roving
around the bank and taking stock, ,as
It were. At 6 he had not departed.
We were working furiously. Tc-m
had a ten cent difference and was
rrowing gray hunting for it. I was
some hundred and fifty odd dollars out,
and was rapidly losing my reason. Jim
hadn't his checks even entered yet, and
was apparently going to sleep standing.
Art had his balance, and from the top
of a etooi was yawning, and between
gasps smiling sweetly at my vocabu
lary and egging me on. By seven we
were all waiting for Jim. He had his
footings, he said, and thought he had
a difference, but wasn't sure how much.
At this brilliant announcement Tom
took Jim's books and straightened
things out. By that time it was seven
thiity, and I for oae was limp with
hunger.
Fortunately the cash was $2 over, and
we closed up for the night. As the
cashier philosophically observed, If the
bank was ahead $2, there'd be no trou
ble finding out who was short.
As we turned out the lights and shut
the shutters we came upon the boy, still
sitting in the window. Tom asked him
who he was and he said his name was
Bob. He gave no sign of needing sym- *
pathy expressed in either words or
cash. Rather he gave one the Impres
sion of beln- excellently well able to
care for himself. He left the bank with
ujÂ», and we separated in a wild rush
for something to eat.
I wa* the first to reach the bank
next morning, but Bob was waiting on
the steps outÃide. He came in with me,
helped me open the windows, and would
have accompanied me inside the cage
had I not remonstrated. I was not sure
whether he thought he belonged to the
bank or the bank belonged to him, but
it was one of the two. He tpok the
rebuff, however, with a resigned phil
osophy, and seated himself as before
in the open window. When Tom ar
rived he stopped short on seeing the
boy.
"Well, kid, been here afl night?" he
asked pleasantly.
"Yep," replied Bob.
"Where?" asked Tom at the startling
announcement.
"Out front,** replied the boy.
"You didn't* sleep on tne steps ?â¢â¢
"Yep."
"Had any breakfast?"
"Nope."
"The deuce! Have anything to eat
last night Y
"Nope."
"Why, the devilâ you must be near
starved."
"You're dead right," said Bob.
Tom hurriedly brought out a quarter
and gave it to him. telling him to go
across the street and fill up. The boy
obeyed without wasting any time, and
Tom came Inside.
"Did you hear what that kid said?"
he asked me. "How about his sleeping
on those stone steps without anything
to eat? It makes me cold to think of
it."
The cashier and Mr. Harvey had both
arrived when Bob returned. Tom re
lated the conversation, and the cashier
spo-ke not unkindly to the boy.
"What are you doing around here?"
he said.
"Lookin' for a job, sir," said Bob sol
emnly.
"But I told you we had no place for
you," said the cashier.
"Well. I thought I'd just hang around
an' see if somethin' didn't turn up," he
replied.
He seated himself in the window and
proceeded to "hang around."
His first official recognition came
about 10 o'clock, when the cashier gave
him a sight draft to take around to
Jim Clark for acceptance. .
"Get him to write his name on the
face of it," he explained, as Bob left.
Twelve o'clock came and he had not
returned.
'"Takes that boy a good while to go
round the corner and back," observed
the cashier.
"I -didn't like his looks the first time
I saw. him," said Harvey. "He looked
sort of slow to me."
It "may be stated here as well as else
where that Harvey's intellect has never
been known to produce an original
idea. Certainly he has never expressed
one. Inside the bank he is the cash
ier's "me-too" in all things, however
great c-r small. Outside he fills a like
position for any one he chances to meet.
Harvey is loosely put together and
walks from hiss knees as though he
feared a good full swing might shake
a leg off. Now it is a singular fact, but
I have never known a man who walked
from his knees who amounted to a row
of brass tacks with the heads off.
However, to give the angel his due,
he is a fair accountant and draws a
good salary, which goes to show that in
this perverse generation of vipers it
isn't always the man who commands
the money. I, for Instance, was getting
only about half as much as Harvey.
About 12:30 the telephone bell hod an
unusually violent spasm, and I answer
ed the call. Jim Clark requested, in no
vacillating spirit, that we call off our
dog. For a moment I thought Mr.
Clark was suddenly gone insane, and I
was rapidly formulating plans to hold
his attention while I sent for Williams,
the constable, when I remembered Bob.
"There's a boy over here with a
draft," pursued Mr. Clark; "says he's
from the bank. I don't owe the money,
and I won't accept the thing, an' he
says he'll stay with me till I write ray
name on the face. Says you people
told him to. Send somebody over here
an' get him, will you?"
I had to go over and bring Bob back,
as he declined to be "called off" by
means of the 'phone. He told Mr.
Clark he waen't that easy.
Everybody in our town knows every
body else â at least by sight; and pre
vious to his advent at the bank Bob
had not been one of the population.
Whence he came he declined to s^ate,
simply saying he "come in a boxcar."
Aside from what we dubbed his "car
rot patch," he was by no means bril
liant or otherwise attractive; in fact,
he was distinctly the opposite. But for
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALU
deadly tenacity of purpopa, as Tom re
marked, "he'd beat the prize bull terrier
in a bench show."
So far as we could learn he had made
no other endeavor to get a place. He
came to us first, it may be by chance;
he liked our looks, and he stayed with
us like a Vera Cruz flea.
However* Bob had been with us near
ly a year, and had, as I say, made him
self Indispensable to Jim and me be
fore he succeeded in attaching himself
to the bank as one of the permanent
fixtures. After the events I am about
to relate the directors would have put
up with the loss of the cashier; or Har
vey, or even me, before they would
have let Bob go. He's with us yet, and
will be till either he or the bank goes
up.
Our bank is the only Institution r-f
the kind in the vicinity. North one
must go six miles, south twenty miles
and west twelve miles to find another
place of deposit, and to the east is the
Atlantic Ocean. This being so. the bank
is unusually prosperous ror a country
institution, paying regular dividends of
12 and 13 per cent to its stockholders.
It is run conservatively^ and is as sound
and safe as United States 4sâ almost.
Our trouble began with the failure
of the Tidewater Trust Company of
New York. This bank was our city
correspondent, and with it. we had on
deposit some $40,000, drawing a law in
terest and available immediately In
time of need. This amount was nearly
four-fifths of our ready cash to meet
the demands of depositors. The bulk
of our deposits was, of course, invested
in short time paper, not available until
maturity â and not always then â and
some of the assets was in the form of
real estate, inconvertible except at a
heavy loss. There was something like
$10,000 cash actually in the bank, to meet
5200,000 worth of deposits, and the day
when the New York papers announced
the failure of the Tidewater saw the
beginning of the only run our bank has
ever experienced. That it stood the
strain was due entirely to Bob.
Fortunately the knowledge that we
were badly caught In the Tidewater
failure did not become generally known
until afternoon, and the $10,000 held out
till we could close the bank doors at 3.
I was dismally doing my work that
night, wondering where I could get an
other place if the bank went under,
when I berame aware of Rob at my
elbow. He looked more doleful than I
felt.
"Oh! cheer upJ' I said: "it may not
be true. Yc-u look as though you'd just
been measured by the undertaker.".
He looked at me solemnly, as though
not certain of my sanity.
"We'll pull through yet," I said.
"Huh," he grunted; "I ain't worry
ing none about the bank. Mr. Martin'll
tend to the bank all right."
The cashier was his god, and before
him only he bowed down.
"I seen me dad this afternoon," he
added dismally.
"Well, that's good," I said; "bring
him round and introduce htm. If he's
anything like you, though, tell him not
to make a long call," I added, it is
never to let a boy get the idea
he is indispensable, even when he is.
"He didn't see me, though," Bob con
tinued, ignoring my levity. "Wonder
how he follered me clean here. Thought
I'd shook him for keeps. I bet he ain't
bumroln' 'round here for no good,
neither."
"You unfllial little barbarian," I
said. "You don't seem incrusted with
smiles at the advent of your long-lost
parent."
"Tlnk you're funny, don't you,
huh?" said Bob, and left me, and I
promptly forgot his dad.
There was a convocation of directors
in the bank parlors that afternoon,
which immediately converted itself into
a committee of the whole on ways and
means. Mr. Martin had sent off tele
grams to half a dozen of the nearest
banks asking assistance and offering to
deposit bonds as security. Ten thou
sand dollars was obtained Jn this way
from the Beach Grove Banking: Com
pany, and came in on the last train
south that evening. The only other
bank able to help was the Longford
First National, which offered $20,000 if
we would come and get iu> The last
train to the west was gone, and there
was no train back that night.
Longford is twelve miles" west of our
town and over bad roads. If we could
get this $20,000, the cashier believed it
would tide us over and restore confi
dence in our ability to pay dollar for
dollar. If we did not get it the bank
must close Its doors by 12 next day al
most to a certainty. Some one must
drive across to Longford with the
bonds and return with the money be
fore the bank opened next morning.
Our part of the country is as safe as
any other; but under the circumstances,
when the composite eye of the commu
nity was centered upon the bank, it
would be impossible for one of the bank
force to leave town without the object
of his mission being Immediately sur
mised. And in our town it is a common
saying that a dollar bill looks to some
folk as big as a ten-acre lot. So it was
not a hilarious party which drove west
late that evening. There was too much
at stake.
We had a two-seated buckboard and
a good team. The cashier and I sat
behind, with the bonds in a valise be
tween us. When we were ready to
start. Bob climbed up beside the driver
on the front seat.
"Here, Bob," said Mr. Martin sharp
ly, "we can't take you."
"I got to go," said Bob simply, and
he went. Mr. Martin may have real
ized that since he had deoided to go it
would be impossible to leave him be
hind. He would have materialised at
Longford from some impossible part of
the vehicle as sure as we had tried it.
The cashier had two revolvers and I
had one. The other one of the four al
ways kept in the bank could not be
found when we were ready to start.
However, we didn't use those we had.
We reached Longford in good time and
drove directly to the bank. The cashier
had been advised of our coming by tel
egram, and was waiting for, us. We
handed over the bonds, received the
each in small bills, and started back in
good spirits.
It was near 2 hi the morning when
we approached our town. I had had
a hard day's work, and confess to hav
ing been nearer asleep than awake.
Still I heard Bob say to the driver:
"If anything happens you give the
horses one almighty cut an' drive for
town, an' don't stop till we get there
see V"
The driver laughed.
"Don't get scared, kid," he said.
"We're most home now."
About one minute after this things
happened.
The buckboard stopped with a jolt,
and I came back to the melancholy
of earth, which I found to con
sist mainly of the wrong end of a 44
caliber revolver. Mr. Martin was see
ing similar sights on his side of the
vehicle. I am not the hero of this nar
rative, and I freely confess that I put
up rqy handsâ good and high. I didn't"
want whoever had the other end of that
gun to entertain any doubts about my
intentions. I was anxious he should
know I was peaceful â extremely so.
What the cashier did I do not know.
but I have my suspicions. At the time
my own troubles were the paramount
issue. That 44 bore an almost speaking
likeness to a thirteen-lnch gun, and I
was completely certain if it exploded
it would blow the whole upper half of
me off into stellar space. I know ex
actly how those Sepoys felt before the
British gunners pulled the lanyards.
The upper half of me didn't want to go.
I felt the valise lifted from my side,
and then we were told to drive on and
not look behind.
"It won't be healthy for you," said
a voice.
Bob had vanished. He sat in front
of me, but I had not seen him go. The
driver said he had slipped to the
ground the moment the horses stopped,
and we pleasantly surmised he had
been worse scared than we were. We
drove into that sleeping town with our
horses in a lather, and within the hour
parties, were out raking the country for
the perpetrators of the "hold-up." We
decided there had been three of them.
One had seized the horses and the
other two had attended to the cashier
and me.
The president and directors absolved
us from all blame after hearing the
story, but Mr. Martin sat at his desk
with bowed head. He tiad been with
the bank for twenty years, and to know
that the Institution was doomed and
that he was at least partially respon
sible was a hard blow. I felt bad
enough myself, but It must have been
harder for him.
I had known some blue times before,
and have known some since; but for
concentrated aniline and indigo, that
morning holds the palm in my expe
rience. We were all dead tired. We
had worked unrler the strain till we
were mentally and physically Incapaci
tated, and then had worked on till our
nerve was gone. Then, too, \f was at
that fearfully devitalizing time, the
hour before sunrise. If you have ever
gotten up at 3 of a winter's morning
to go duck hunting and, after walking
ten miles with a ten-bore gun, have
found no duck, you can get some idea
of our depression. Also we had had no
breakfast.
Things were undoubtedly bad, but if
the sun had been up I think we would
have found some means of escape after
all. But in the dead, cold gloom of the
hour before dawn I felt about ready
for my coffin, and the rest looked it.
Every time the door opened we lc-oked
eagerly up, hoping even when we knew
there was next to no hope, and each
time it was to be disappointed again.
So two eternal hours passed. Harvey
was wandering around and acting like
a she-ass, of course, telling Martin not
to mind, and it couldn't be helped, till
it was a wonder some one didn't kill
him. I considered the matter with a
feeling that it would at least create a
diversion and relieve the suspense.
Jim and Art were dlscusamg the
"hold-up." and telling each other what
the cashier and I should have done.
Their conversation did not interest me.
They had not experienced the thirteen
inch pun. Tom didn't say a word: didn't
even look at us. I always did think he
had good horse sense, and now I knew
it.
Half a dozen of the directors were
sitting around, talking spasmodically
and in whispers, and minutely exam
ining the cracks in the floor. I remem
ber thinking that when a gang of direc
tors eot together and didn't make any
more noise than that, there was some
mijrhty heavy sledding ahead, and no
signs of snow.
I^trled to sleep, but couldn't. I had
too much to think about. There was
nothing ahead t>ut three or four hours'
more work, and then closing the doers
and leaving the old place, with the
Government Commissioner in i harge,
â  and starting out to find a new job sev
eral steps down the ladder. Not a
cheerful prospect.
The outer door opened. I didn't turn
my head. The spring that worked my
hope machine was played out. Then I
heard an unusually profane yell from
Tom, and he went by me and out the
rage door Hke a halfback carrying the
ball. I took one look toward the door
ard followed in similar fashion.
What we saw was a tramp carrying
a satchel â the satchel. Behind him was
another, nursing a badly cut up right
hand and exploding steadily in highly
colored language. And behind both
came Bob, with a revolver at full cock
and his fa<*e a pea-green yellow. It took
us a"botit forty-eight seconds to tie
those tramps hand and foot, and Bob
put down the gun and came Inside with
th* satchel.
"It's all there Mr. Martin," he said.
"I caught 'em 'fore they got it open.
An' â 1 guess I'll sit down. "
He collapsed intu Martin's chair, and
that was the first he knew he wa# hurt.
We got him out on the floor and open
ed his 3hirt. and Martin looked mighty
lumpy in the throat while we were do
ing it. I'm not saying how I felt, t
thought the kid was done for.. He had
a blue- black spot high up in his left
shoulder, and he'd bled about all there
was in him I should think.
Harvey came out from somewher*
and ready to faint, and Martin sent him
off for Doc Richards, and Tom told him
to be "pretty sudden about it." At
such timfs seniority of office doesn't
count.
The directors were treading on one
another to fetch water and produce
handkerchiefs, and the president drew
out a silver flask and we gave Bob
some brandy. That revived him, and he
tried to get up.
"I ain't hart much." he protested. "I
just reel sorter empty â that's all."
He fell back weakly, however., and
lay quiec for a moment. Then he grin
ned happily and said:
I knew dad 'd be up to some mean
ness. He don't miss any chances."
"Fay, it was sreat." he said present
ly, with another grin. "I just walked
in on 'em while they was pryin' the
satchel open, an' I says, 'Put up your
hands, dad; I got you.' an' instead o'
puttin' up the way the books says they
does he_ pulled a revolver an' shot me.
But. say. I fired 'bout the same time an'
knocked his revolver all to chunks. Gee,
it wa3 great:"
He stopped again from sheer weak
ness. Then he looked up at Martin on
his knees beside him and said:
"Next time I'm goin' to drive, Mr.
Martin. If that blame driver had cut
the horses like I told him to we'd *Â»
come through all right."
'Very well, Bob*." said Martin, and I
think he meant It.
H was bleeding- tr> death, and I
thought the doctor would never come.
It seemed pretty tough luck afttr
what he'd done. His parent was lying
on his back, cursing likÂ» an Irish Oat
ling gun. and when I got to the point
where I hart to do something or make
a foot of myself I hunted up Williams,
and we kicked them both on to their
fe<n and put them in the lock-up.
"VVh^ n I got back the doctor was mak
ing his examination. It was a solemn
that 3tood around and watched
him. Bob was the only cheerful one in,
the lot. Fortunately the bullet had
gone clear through, so there was no
probing to do.
WhÂ»n the last bandags was fixed Be*
tried to get up again and had to be held
down while Doc Richards explained to
him that he would probably bleed to
death if he didn't lie still. Then we put
him on an improvised stretcher and
took him up to Martins. I waylaid the
doctor.
"Will he get well. Doer* I asked.
"Yes," said the doctor, "I think so.
He lost a lot of blood, but he's pretty
tough, and with Mrs. Martin and thÂ«
girls to nurse him he'll T>e around be
fore long."
I waited till I got a block from the
house, and then turned loose one long
uproarious yell, and doubled for the ;
bank with the news.
"Well, say." said Tom, "isn't that kid
about twenty-four karats fine, though?
Lay nn Mac Duff. He'll be president of
a bank while we're still footing col
umns. You see if h^ isn't."
"I always did rtiink that -boy had
something in him," said Harvey. "He,
sort of looked like it to me first time I
Hi him."

WE are living in town now, and Duchess, she sees
v piece, in de paper where de reporter says dat .
â¢ signs of 'spring whs butting into de landscape out
'_â¢ -':-; . in de country where de landscape grows. It makes
me want to see a bit of it. for de only landscape we S3e3
from.de back window of our house was de back windows
of de ro*v "of houses in de next street.
. . "Dls is. our afternoon out," says Duchess, "so let us
put On our gardening Close and go to de park and see
â¢has any of dose signs of spring come over de ferries and
gone into business in Manhattan."
"Sure," 1 says. "Let us stroll up de avenoo and pipe
off de lads on de boxes and see has dey any signs of spring
about dem, and wolk up to de park and take in de buds
and ting-? dis reporter says can be found if you has your
glasses wit you."
Well, de little old avenoo was all right, but de only
signs.of spring: We seen dere was under de carriages. But
when we gets into de park we rubbers hard and p-chee '
v.c did find a bud or two, and we goes rubbering so hard
to see could we find some of de odder tings de reporter
says â as ou.t on top of de landscape dat a mug was
piping us off he says to me was we from de country, and -
homesick for ,de springtime comes gentle Annie. <
1 was so mad at foist at being mistook for a farmer

de togs we wore, so 1 gives a wink to Duchess, arid says
to de mug dat we was . Dat homesick for de country

Of course Duchess tumbles den dat we was up against
a sure ting gent, and she pla>3 ue game wit all her heart
â and the" can play any game of de kind when she gets
a ste^r dat dere is fun or funds i- sight. .
, Well, say, dc way dat mug snuggles up to us made
me almost s-ori-v for him â but; only almost. He says he
was from de country, too: and was out in de park just
as like we.4. to refresh himself wit de foist peek at any
4"'is: dat looks like it could grow out of doors. Duchess, "â .;.
Â£he turns up her eyes and gives a sigh, .and says dat de
gent was almost as good as de country itself; for if one
couldn't see de real cow- pastures, de next best- ting r whs

tat sure ting gent did smile. He goes on to tell us dat he
hatl just had a bit of good luck dat made his stay in de
wicked and grassless city not co hard to bear.

Old Aunt Becky Wigglesworth raised

should think you had lived long enough
i,ot to want to sec a feller dressed

through a hoop with a piece of paper
pasted over it. But my, you can't tell
about the men these days. I don't
reckon, however, they've changed very
much. 1 recollect that shortly after
me and Mr. Wigglesworth was married
we went to- a circisâ and when a wom
an dressed as no daughter of mins
would ci it ssâ unless mebby she was a
goin' in a-sw immln' â come out and be
gan to flop about on a hos3, I says to
my husband, says I. 'Dan'l, it is time
for us to so.' And he says, â¢Well, no,
not as long as this sort of thing keeps
up.' Said that to me and we hadn't
been married more than three weeks.
Did they have the sacred ox, Limuel?"
"No." Llm answered, "they didn't
have any beef cattle at all. This
vva'n't a circus. Aunt Beccy. It was a.
theater, a play."
"Oh, somethin' like old Sister Phe

think you was too old for that sort

me about it, but I cÂ«i/i't make heads or

"At our college," said the preacher,
"we performed a Shakespearian play
â with certain eliminations. i well
remember the declaiming of young
Oscar Pruitt as Hamlet. Ah, but the
applause he received was his ultimate
downfall. It Mved In his mind and
years afterward he shamelessly de
serte.i the pulpit and toek to the
stage. But in a godless town where he
made his first appearance a minion
of the evil one struck him between
the eyes with a goose egg â in the sol
iloquy seene â and he was no mortified
that he fled to the Mississippi River
and spent the remainder of his life in
playing poker on a steamboat. But
what play did you see, Brother Litn
ue>?"
"Macbeth. I had read it o\er and
over many a time. I could see r\ight
scarfin" up the eye of day â could see
the bats skimmin' the dark edges of
the comin' night and could hear the
screech owls. 1 could hear the wind
mournin' among the winter-stiffened
twigs of the trees â could see the
ocean turnin' red as Macbeth tried to
wash the blood off his handsâ could
hear the poor wretches mutterin' In
their sleep as Duncan's gore was
smeared on their faces â could see and
hear everything. It was real. But
the thing I saw In the theater fell
short. 1 knew that the walls were
canvas. And then I thought of a
great fact, that Shakespeare carried
his .scenery between his lines, that he
threw a valley, a hill into the mind
and mude it live, a reality. This play
1 sa w was overloaded with flimsy
things, (laps that shook â and the men
nnd women didn't make me believe
they were in earnest. I'd rather read
it. for then Shakespeare acts it him
pelf and We know he was in earnest
and believed it was all a truth. I
â waited for the utterance of the great
ideas that sometimes in the dark of
night wlien the wind r.as a-blowin'

up out ot my chair: and I looked for

Weil. I goes back to de gent and I
says dat me good wife v.as willing to
give 'cm two hundred dollars for de
lottery ticket, for to let him hurry
home to his old modder before she died.
Bote de sure ting gents had ail dey
' could do for not to show what a soft
Riime dey tinks me and Duchess; but
d-.y makes a good bluff at it, and says,
how would we pay de money. I says
dat \\t_ has just $205 left in de bank,
and would give en a check for it all,
an.l collect de ticket, and go about our
shopping, and not be troubled wit go
inÃ to de bank any more at all.
Dey says dat was a good plan, not
tV have any more to do wit de bank;
dat dey would collect de money on her
check, and we could go about our busi
ness wit no more bodder.
When I calls up Duchesy to make
good she gets cold feet. "How did
*he know dat de ticket was wort a
tousand dollars?"
"Let me see it." says de second sure
ting gent, like he was a bank teller
'himself. "I will settle dat in a minute."
Well, he takes de ticket, and he
toms it over and upside down, and
pipes it off hard to be aure dat it
wasn't a counterfeit, and he says, sol
emn as a judge in de Tombs. "Dats
all right, fren. I'll go wit you to de
lottery office if you want, and see dat
de cashier pays you witout no trouble."
Den Duchess says dat it wouldn't do.
after all. We had ton dollars' wort of
shopping for to do before we could
collect de ticket, and de chance of
five from her check of $205 wouldn't
bo enough.
She puts up her checkbook in her
ridicule, and says to me for to come
away, quick, for she didn't quite be
lieve it was all right.
At de sight of de checkbook, which
was do real ting, and showed where
- Duchess had made checks, de gents'
mouts was watering like a bull pup's
at de sight of a plate of chops, and
dey looked like dey could murder

number one. "I hate to let dis lottery
ticket go so cheap, but grive me de
check and I'll give you de $10 in ready
money you need for your shopping be
fore you get de ticket cashed."
Duchess â¢ she takes me aside attain,
and she makes a bluff of arguinc dat
sho ought not to do It, and I makes out
like I was urging her to do it, and all
de time she was whispering: "Oh. it's
too easy! We should stood out for fif

much real money. Here's de check.
Cheemes. You finish trimmtn' 'em: I
can't keep from laughing."
Well, p-chee, she takes out her soout-

scared. I didn't reel like somebody
had jumped out of the dark at me. '
â¢Then you were disappointed, said
the preacher. .
â¢â¢Yes for I didn't meet the appointed

The woods moved up tow art me like

down my book and turned to the play,
and the rtrst thing I knowed there was
that somethin' a-creepin' up my back,

play it myself. Then the old castle

feller i-ver at our schoolhouse one
night not long ago that could call th?
cows home, 1 tell you. He swallowed a
knife us longâ long as a stick of stove
wood. And he done the funniest thins;
you ever seen. He called on somebody
to go up on the platform, and Bill
Hancy he went up and he took Bill's
hat and pulled out baby clothes till it
looked like a weeks washin'. Oh, he
done a good many thingsâ about as
great a man as I ever saw. And now
mebby he could have helped your show
out. Limuel. Wouldn't you have liked
it better if a few of them sort of tricks
had been put into it? That wcnild

must be better tiddlers than he is. but
I believe he can play louder. Mebby
It is because he generally has more
room. He sets out on the shed and

Honest, it did sound like dey was tell

So I says, holding on to de check
like I hated to part with it, "Well,

On de level, dey was so keen to get

"Say, young fellow. How about dis*

the one to revel in gorgeous colors, and

yoitng an 3 pretty and blooming, and
â¢ last but not least, she must be dressed
in^ink. " ***.
For be it known the wedding colors
this spring- are pick. and lilac. Even
the- bride -deviates from the narrow,
â whitc.^ath and carries roses, orchids
or pinks,'* or she even goes into the par
den Â«nd gets a great bunch of lilacs
1 showing ; pihV touches. ' Her '.gown " is
white, but pink and pink alone is the
color of the flowers.
"i . The "Easter bride, as she is called,
generally, has need of a multitude of
charming^ cummer frocks and she has
t been 'Vise enough to :â  realize that an
elaborate .satin affair is good for just
. ore pccaeibn, and that, as soon as she
lias ' added the pt-gfix. of Mrs. to her
4atnej Â«he will have the pleasure of
patting it v aw *}y in tissue paper and
delicately .scented lavender bags. For
â¢omehow or qther a wedding gown
â¢Is ways a* wedding gown, and while it
.-may be beautiful it rarely if ever is
. Serviceable. â¢
f "teo the sensible bride of Easter month
has planned a simple ".gown. for really,
after all is said and done, the plainer
the biide'^f rock is made the better th*
result.' It'is, Â«not necessary to make it
bo very, elaborate and brides are slowly
but surely awaking to this fact. The
wil hides thÂ« gown, which, if white and
g&ssy and nicely finished, scarcely
shows at all. . :. .
Bobbinct is a material that Is begin
ning to oome Into prominence and as It
Is cheapr-some 30 cents a yard for a
fair cuajftyâ it deserves to be popu-
l ar. '
Unfortunately Dame Fashion rather
insists upon a wedding gown with a
train. But if it Is made with two wide
ruffles v ith shirred headings, " and a
â¢ simple little shirt waist. effect with
â¢pointed â  front, it is a very little
thing to transform it into a piazza
gown by cutting off the train â¢ and
m&lfing the skirt* suitable for walking
purposes or for dancing.
And, by the. way, let me tell you
while I think of it, the Easter girl Is
shirt waist crazy. Everything must be
cot after the simple fashion, even if
ft-*is transformed by draping a lace
bertha across^ the bust to make the
full ' French puffed waist.
And one other fad she possesses as
well. ThÂ« jewelry craze. If she is for
tunate ' enough to possess a diamond
star vor a. diamond necklace, she may
wear it with all propriety on her wed
ding day, or she may even loop a string
of pearls about her throat and, still be
quite in style, for these days it is con
sidered good form to do Bo.^pflHjjjggg!
And not only this. Bracelets are all
the craze and the Easter bride should
be in clover. To be sure, the newest
bracelets are of silver chains that are
very' heavy and made of . sliver : links,
but-even r if such is the case, there is
â¢scarcely, any possibilities; of makfhg a
mistake in , this line, for ; everything
and anything seems to 1 be absolutely
fit. . , rifpiM HBm WtftPMtf ii M?vwi
All of her old-fashioned trinkets may

time flat gold bracelet, thin as a wafer,

Answers to
Correspondents
FITTED PETTICOATS (Too
Stout). â Your trouble is largely due
to improper dressing. To overcome
much of the bulkiness about the hips
discard all full gathered petticoats
and substitute those that are gored
and carefully fitted like a dress skirt.
Use a five or seven gored petticoat
pattern with an inverted box-plait at
the middle of the back and finished
with a flounce. Adjust the belt the
required size and close with a flat but
ton or with hooks and eyes. The
tapes tied in front and bunchy gathers
probably cause your well-made new
skirts to wrinkle below the belt Un
dervests and drawers should fit snugly
about the hips and the latter should
always be put on under the corset.
AFTER THEATER SUPPER (Mrs.
Thomas B.).â The following menu will
be found dainty, appetizing and suf
ficient for an after theater supper:
Oysters on the half shell, bouillon in
cups, lobster a la Newburg or sweet
breads and fresh peas, salads, ices,
bonbons, cake and coffee. As to
whether it should be served at home
or in a restaurant is largely a matter
of convenience to the host or hostess.
Unless your cook is very skillful you
will probably be better satisfied with
the work of some establishment where
a specialty is made of such dishes as
I have named and you will be relieved
of all anxiety incident to serving.
When the party to be served is large
make your arrangements with the ca
terer early in the day and there wm
be no tiresome waits after the arrival
from the theater.
HINTS FOR BUSINESS WOMEN
(Grade).â The veman who must get to
an office promptly each day can sayÂ«
herself needless worry and have much
more time for the coveted morning nap
if she will make a few needful prepara
tions before retiring. Sew on loose but
tons,- polish the shoes and mend the
gloves. Arrange the clothing and ac
cessories conveniently near on a chair
to facilitate dressing in the morning.
Clothing which has been worn all day
in a close office should be taken off,
after reaching home, brushed and hung
in the open air or spread over a chair
near an open window. You will feel
and look better for this extra care of
your clothing. Be particular to brush
your hair thoroughly before retiring
and it will need less care in the morn
ing. Manicure your nails and have all
toilet articles in place for immediate
use in the morning. The want of a pin
or a veil at the eleventh hour and the
turning, of a room topsy-turvey In an
effort to find the desired article is an
noying, t<j say the least. In brief, learn
to gystemike your dressing, then there
will be less rush and plenty of time

PLAYTHINGS FOR CHILDREN
(Mrs. P. 8.).â T0 keep a very young
child amused give him only one or two
toys during the day; the next day bring
out something else and lay the first
one aside. By this plan he will forget
the first toys at the end of a week and
they will entertain him again, while if
the entire supply is spread before him
each day the little mind becomes con
fused and wearied in the very effort to
make a selection and peevish discon
tent results. Parents make a serious
mistake in supplying all manner of me
chanical devices for the entertainment
of a young child; nothing is left for his
imagination or ingenuity to supply,
hence the child soon becomes blase,
nothing is wonderful enough to arouse
his interest and he utterly falls to ap
preciate any simple toy which requires
the slightest mental or physical effort
to convert into a game. Keep all the
amusements for the child very simple
and do not keep up a constant routino
of diversions in the way of talking
tossing or rocking him. This methoct
of training wears out the nurse or the
mother and does the child much more
harm than good. Leave the youngster
to himself a part of the day and he will
gain in self-reliance and bÂ« less fret
ful. You have undoubtedly over-excit
ed the child.
TREATING SORE MOUTH (Leila
B.). â The painful spots in the mouth
wh'ch are yellowish white in the cen
ter and highly inflamed around the
outer edges indicate a cankered sore
mouth. It is a disease of the mucous
membrane and to prevent the ulcer
like sores from spreading the mouth
should be thoroughly rinsed out with
water in which tincture of myrrh has
been dropped in the proportions of
one teaspoonful of tincture to one-half
The release of the
Lenten Girl
pint of water. While the cankered
sorÂ« mouth Is very painful It is not
dangerous and may arise from acidity
of the stomach, impure or feverish
state of the blood, superinduced by
some functional disturbance. The
most effective way to prevent these
sores is to improve the condition of
the digestive organs and take a good
blood purifier. To reduce the inflam
mation take one ounce each of
glycerin and perchloride of iron, mix
thoroughly and pour a few drops on
a china plate. Dip a camel's hair
brush in the mixture and touch each
spot thoroughly and after a few min
utes rinse the mouth thoroughly to
free the teeth from the iron. During
the attack refrain from eating any
food which irritates the sores. Cheese,
salt and lemons are particularly dis
tressing.
REDNESS OF THE NOSE (Mary
B.). â The three moat common causes of
redness of the nose are Indigestion, im
perfect circulation and insipid erysipe
latous inflammation. Unless indiges
tion has become chronic you will ob
serve that the nose is almost of normal
color before breakfast, but after that
meal, and especially after a heavy din
ner, the rubicund color will begin to
manifest itself most clearly. If this
corresponds to your condition be more
careful of your diet and especially
avoid all wines and alcoholic drinks.
Obtain a reliable remedy from your
physician to correct the acidity of the
stomach and any disposition toward
constipation. Be sure that your cloth
ing is comfortably loose and Indulge in
plenty of outdoor exercise. To further
excite the circulation give the entire
body a brisk rubbing with a Turkish
bath mitten before retiring and on get
ting out of bed In the morning, and by
all means continue the cool water
sponge baths In the morning. After a
few weeks you may venture to use
quite cold water. Keep the body ex
quisitely clean by frequent warm water
baths and avoid anything which may
excite the undesirable color, such a*
the harsh use of a handkerchief or Urn
Madge
Moore
thoughtless rubbfns of the nose when
"talking. By resorting J to internal and
i xt^rnal remedies the trouble can,
probably, be readily corrected. To as
sist in allaying the wlness have the
following lotion prepared by a drug
gist: Two ounces of* glycerine, three
ounces elder tlqwer water, one drachm
of muriate of ammonia, one-half
drachm of tannlc acid. Saturate a
piece of absorbent cotton with tha lo
tion and bind on the nose T>efore retir
ing. You may also bathe the nose sev
eral times a day with ihia lotion.
PREVENTION OF STOUTNESS
tM. B. and F. L.. N.) â Many women
voice the sentiment of Hamlet, "O,
that this too too soli<4 flesh would melt,'*
yet when a little self-denial is hinted
at they are ready to offer ail manner
of excuses, and because increasing adi
pose tissues are peculiar to middle life,
supinely fold their hands and let flesh.
accumulate, spending the time they
should employ in getting rid of taia
flesh by annoying their family over
their physical burden. Unless It has
become a diseased condition there is
no reason why fat cannot be held iv
abeyance if properly controlled and
treated in the beginning; this is half
the battle. If the woman threatened
with obesity will change her method
of living, nine times .out of ten a de
cided reduction in weight can be safely
made and by rational, means which,
will, as well, improve the general
health Turkish baths, promiscuous
experimenting with drugs * and thÂ©
starvation diet cannot Jae^too strongly
condemned; they do more harm than
good and are often positively danger
ous, Injuring the health without rt
moving a pound of rlesh. When a par
son has grown, to an excessive weight
I would not advise hohiÂ© treatment, for
the vital organs are a,H,of them more or
less affected by the weight upon them,
and only a skilled physician can de
termine what regime is best to pur
sue. Cut off all sweets, starchy and
greasy foods and use feweet' milk and
cream in moderation. The diet should
be nourishing and light. Drink "noth
ing at meals and restrict^ liquids be
tween meals to three pints or less of
pure water during the twenty- four
hours. Sleep seven or eight hours;
ten hours is too long to spend in* bed
and adds to the accumulation of flesh.
Take not less than, three warm tub
baths each week, followed by a cold
eponge bath and a vigorous rub-town.
Walk briskly two or three miles dally
and you will see a decided r%du<ctlon of
weight in six weeks.
SHAMPOOING THE HAEff (Bell*).â
Long, fine hair is rather difÃÂ«ult to
manage, yet it can be successfully
cleaned by exercising a, little patience,
and the painful tangle and chill of
which you complain be avoided. Be
fore wetting the hair be sure you hays
everything needed in readiness: plenty
of fresh buck towels which are freÂ«
from lint are best. Have an abundance
of pure soft water, both warm and cool,
and some pure bland soap. Xaver use
Inferior soap nor an unknown shampoo
mixture and also avoid the frequent use
of borax and ammonia. If the hair is
dark and oily a few drops of ammonia
or a pinch of borax in a large basin
of water will not be injurious, but
either is Injurious when the hair is
light in color and dry and fine. Part
the hair through the center, from the
forehead to the neck,, and comb for
ward; tie the other half so that It will
not become tangled . and proceed to
wash one half and then the other, rub
bing a lather, made of the soap and a
little hot water, into the 'scalp with tfce
tips of the fingers. inp and squeeze
the hair in the warm watÂ«* until clean,
rinse in several waters, each a Uttle
cooler than the preceding, and last in
cold water. Wipe and press the hair
with towels to remove the water as
quickly as possible. Shake out <Â£he
damp strancte and sit or stand near a
fire or a register to facilitate) the dry
ing. Comb out any tangjes, rui the
scalp thoroughly with a tonic com
posed of bay rum and quinine which
may be obtained of any flrst-class
druggist. The rum keeps tha hair dry
and soft and prevents one from taking
cold. A reliable shampoo mixture is
made in the following manner: Shava
a half pound bar of pure castile soap
Into one quart of boiling water; when
dissolved add one teaspoonful of bi
carbonate of sode, cool, periume if de
sired, and pour into a wide mouth Jar
so that the Jelly-like substance may bÂ«
readiiy removed when wasted. To use
dissolve a tablespoonful of the mixture
in a cuo of hot water, rub into the
scalp and wash and rinse as abova di
rected.

Kino Leopold Buys Off His Daughter
One Report Says That She
May Become Bride of
King off Saxony,
BRUSSELS. April 29. â It has been
authoritatively announced that there
â¢vrill be no marriage between Prince
' Victor Napoleon and Princess Clem
entine of Belgium.. The claimant to
the French throne and the daughter
of the King of the Belgians have
yielded to diplomatic and family pres
sure and -abandoned their engage
â¢ ment. - ,
i Curiously enough, the . person who
really comes out on top in the queer
game thar aagust folk have been play
ir.g wi;h Cupid in tile last few months
is the one whbse interests have been
apparently least ' considered by themâ
iladame Â«'c Beauclerc. the beautiful
morganatic wife of Prince Victor. It
â was reported sorns time ago that she
had eflac-ed herself as a possible im
pediment Ito the marriage by wedding
an Italia^ nobleman.
The stbry", however, was probably
circulate*? lo make things easier for
the "French pretender and to quiet the
jctmscienc^ of some of his supporters
who are iiot disposed to recognize the
superiority of royalty to the claims of
ordinary â¢ rality. Even among no
blemen with free and easy notions of
matrimony it is difficult to find a man
willing to, take over a family of quasi
â¢ Illegitimate children. Anyhow, he
has nptyet turned up.
* APPEALS TO EUGENIE.
\ * While the snatch was pendÂ°ing' - Ma
dame de BeaucleVc, who figures in the
directors* "kb a widow, left her house
%in me Rue..de Livourne, where the
Xapoleonift. heir was in the habit of
. viEltins-her daily. It is expected, how
ever, that she will soon return to it and
m that in the pleasures of domestic life
the Princ,e will ace himself' for the
. Â». Joes of Clem^-.tine while his agents are
â¢ skirmishing arrirr^g the courts of Eu
rope for. "her prospective bride.
What mwadame has been doing dur
ing her absence from Brussels has
Leen kept, extremely quiet. She is a
I very discreet, retiring sort of woman,
as becomes one occupying her anomal
ous ppsition. A photograph of her
would be worth considerably more
than its weight in gold, but it is im
possible to obtain such a likeness.
Only "fakes"* are circulated.
It is stated, on the best authority
that Madame de Beauclerc personally
appealed to the ex-Empress Eugenic
to use hex* influence against the mar
riage. One of the most tragic figures
on the European Â£iage, whose hopes
and* ambitions have all been buried
la the grave, poor Eugenie's own suf
ferings might well have moved* her to
sympathize with the woman who,
whatever may be her legal status, has
long been a faithful wife' to Victor
.Napoleon â¢ #
KING OPPOSES MATCH.
Whatever motives irfay have weigh
ed most with the ex-Empress, some
say it was the fear of causing an em
broilment ; between Belgium and
France, she certainly changed her
views on the projected marriage. Not
content with merely withdrawing the
consent to it which she had given, she
threatened to cut the Prince out of
lier will If he persisted in adhering to
th,Â«? engagement and furthermore to
o deprive him of the annual allowance
lof .000 francs, whjch she has made
him for many years.
It was that which settled the matter
with this pitiful representative of the
name and fame of the greatest man in
French history. With his supply of
cash short h<Â» could no longer dream
in comfort of the greatness he hopes
his shadowy^fnheritance will some day
bring him without incurring any risk
of endangering his own precious skin.
On the s other side. King Leopold
pulled all the strings possible to in
duce Clementine to renounce the en
gagement which she had entered into
in defiance of Ilia authority. In response
to hints from the throne, many men
prominent in public affair*, among
others the Fâ¢â¢â¢-!Â«F â¢â¢â¢-!Â« Minister, wrote her
letter? Imploring her net to endanger
Belgium's pacific relations with France
by wedding a man whose ambition
K could be realized only through the de
struction of the republic. It was
pointed out to her that if she per
sisted in that course ft might lead to
the ultimate sacrifice of Belgium's in
dependence. She was. asked to set an
example of exalted patriotism and sac-
Irlfice hfcr affections on the altar of her
country.
She did not lack for other advisers
who, professing to be actuated only by
considerations of her personal welfare,
assured her that with a man like Vic
tor. Napoleon her married â¢ life would
inevitably be a joyless one; that be
tween her and happiness would always
intervene the memory of the woman
who had the best claim on his life's
affections.

nunciation. It is a separate establish
ment of her q,wn, where she will be
freed from her fathers tyrannous do
mestic rule. That is now being pre
pared for her and will be ready for her
occupancy when she returns from the
Riviera. It is a picturesque little place
at Laeken. known as th<? Belvidere. and
is situated opposite the monument to
Leopold I.
\ There is no question of any hearts
being broken over the business.
Clementine is in her thirty-third year
and there is nothing of the spring
chicken about her. So much unhappi
ness she has seen in her family that
she can have few of the illusions of
youth left. It was "said when she be
came engaged to' the Prince that the
motive which weighed most strongly
with her was the desire to obtain a
home of her own where the King could
no longer tfneer over her. That she
has now obtained and doubtless thinks
It well worth all the fuss it has cost
her to get it.
Ai= for Victor Napoleon, no one im
agines that he was ever very seriously
in love with the Princess. . He is 43
years old and as a would-be Emperor
he holds that the question of mutual
affections is a minor matter where
royal alliances are concerned. As he
has been 'getting on in life he has been
urged to marry in order to provide a
legitimate heir to the throne he covets.
Very likely he will . postpone tackling
the matrimonial question again until
his aunt. ex-Empress Eugenic, is dead
and- he is in possession .'of her money.
MAY WED SAXON KING. .
Meanwhile there is already talk of
another match for Clementine. The
visit of the Dowager Queen of Saxon;
to the Count and Countess of Flanders
âthe Count h King Leopold* brother
â is generally regarded as a prelude to
negotiations for a marriage between
the Princess and the King of Saxony,
who divorced his wife, now the
Â«'ountfss of Montignoso, after her esca
pade with M. Glron.
The story has been denied by cer
tain Belgian organs that are supposed
!to gÂ»t tips from the King, hut that
. does not prove there is no truth in
it. It only shows that the King does
not desire a public discussion of the
matter just now. As regards assur
i ances of domef=tio happiness, such a
I match does sot hold particularly bright
rrospects for the Princess, but royal
; blooded maidens cannot indulge in thÂ»
luxury of choosing their own hus
bands.

1 elder sister, has just written a letter

FRESH HOPE
FOR BRITISH
SUFFRAGISTS
John Morleu Won Over
to the Cause of
ttia Women, -
LONDOX, April 29.â Woman suffrag
ists are jubilant over the success of
their recent Queens Hall demonstra
tion, which was attended by one hun
dred members of Parliament and Par
liamentary candidates, who pledged
themselves to vote for a bill conferring
the ballot on the weaker sex. Thirty
five more who couldn't attend had
promised to support the measure.
Among the latter was John Morley.
The great Liberal statesman for a brief
period ranged himself on the side of
thos* who are opposed to conferring
political powers on women, and the
message he sent was greeted with
eomething of that exuberant Joy which
is felt for the return of the repentant
sinner. But the votes promised fall far
short of being enough to carry a bill
through the House of Commons, and
there is the House of Lords to be reck
oned with later.
Labouchere asserts that the support
pledged amounts to little as an indica
tion of Parliamentary feeling on the
subject. "M. P.'s," he says, "are al
ways weak where women are concern
ed. A deputation of women come to a
candidate when contesting a constitu
ency to plead the cause of what are
called women's rights. He succumbs
and agrees to support the rights' in the
hope that a sufficient number of M. P.'s
are not so flabby as himself when pit
ted against the fair sex and that they
will defeat any attempt to write these
'rights' on the statute book."
The candid cynic disputes women's
fitness for political emancipation.
"My experience of women," he says,
"is that they are usually given to too
much talking, and that they approach
every subject* with a foregone conclu
sion. Let any one try to argue with
the average woman and he will find
that what I say is true. She never an
swers an argument, but when her
views are met with objections she re
peats her original opinion with a su
perfluity of words that an M. P. talk
ing commonplace against time might
envy."
It is interesting to recall how the
women of an earlier generation re-
Bented and defied a resolution to ex
clude ladies from the galleries of the
two houses of Parliament, which was
passed in 1738. Lady Mary Wortley
Montagu relates how a band of fash
ionables presented themselves In due

season and requested admission. They
came at 9 o'clock In the morning,
â when Sir William Saunderson respect
fully informed them that the Chancel
lor had made an order against their
admission. The Duchess of Queens
berry, as head of the squadron, pooh
hooed the ill-breeding of a mere law
yer and desired him to let them up
stairs privately. After some modest
refusals he swore he would not let
them in.
Her Grace, with a noble warmth,
answered that they would come in in
spite of the Chancellor and the whole
house. This being reported, he then
resolved to starve them out. An order
was made that the door should not be
opened until they had raised the siege.

zons showed themselves well qualified

stood there until 5 o'clock in the aft
ernoon without sustenance, every now
and then plying volleys of thumps,
kicks and raps against the door, with
so much violence that the speakers in
the House were hardly heard.
When the Lords were not to be con
quered by this, the Duchess resorted
to stratagem and commanded a dead
silence for half an hour. The Chan
cellor, regarding this as certain proof
that they had withdrawn, gave orders
for the opening of the door, upon
which they all rushed in, pushed aside
their competitors and placed them
selves in the front rnw of the gallery.
And they remained there until after
11. when the House rose, giving vent to
their feelings occasionally by "noisy
laughs and contempts."
Ladies have now l<jng been able to
obtain admission to Parliament as

members, but they find greater attrac
tions in the tea, ices and strawberries

PARIS, April 29.â An amusing story
with international complications comes
from Corfu. It appears that several
midshipmen from the British flagship
Bulwark, returning to Corfu from the
Achilleon Palace, found that the ferry
could not carry them, so all three
stripped and swam across, forgetful of
the fact that there is a convent on the
island.
The complaints that were made came
to the ears of th" German Emperor,
who signaled to Admiral Domvito: "I
hear that ynur midshipmen have been
shocking the good nuns by their cos
tumes."
Admiral Domvile signaled back: I
have heard of the circumstance your
Majesty mentioned, but you are misin
formed in one particular. The young
gentlemen had no costumes. "

LONDON. April 29.â The DendultAn of
fashion seems to he still twinging back
ward. The tiny 'pork-pie' hat which
crowned the chignons orÂ» our xrand
mothers is to be the smartest headcear
of the coming season, and though it is
hardly an appropriate topknot for the
tall, weil-developed, twentieth-century
woman, it .seems likely to catch on to
a considerable extent.
But the most surprising feature of
the early Victprian revival Is the re
turn*-to favor of the nightcap. It is
not restored in the grotesque form
with which old pictures of indignant
dames lecturing late home-comin* hus
bands have made us familiar. It is a
thing of beauty â small, made of finest
cambric and daintily trimmed with
lace. It must be delicately scented as
perfumed hair Is the vogue of the
moment. In its modified and orna
mental form it has been eagerly wel
c</med, for the prettiest o,f women lose
much of their comeliness when their
foreheads are surrounded by briatling
barricades of steel pins.
In the quest for Â£eauty, woman will
do and dare anything. Some crafty
critics have been taking advantage
of this knowledge to lure her back to
her neglected domestic duties by assert
ing that thf; robust exercisea to wAch
up-to-date girls are addicted â golf,
hockey, lawn tennis and various kinds
of gynjnasticsâ a're producing an awk

despised occupations of the household
are the very things that most quickly
impart grace to the feminine figure and
that for the attainment of Venus-like
perfection of form there is nothing like
sweeping floors, making beds or scour

This Suggests delightful visions of

And here one may be permitted a t

* 3"elcgrapli Hill â Miss Angiin found in
San Francisco her audience, that took
to "The Eternal Feminine" like a duck
to water. -
Why should we not be a little proud
Â«f this? The play had eleven weeks of
, American history before it arrived
here. Chicago saw it among other
. placts, but'-the record has been there j
as everywhere so far: critical appre- I
ciation â¢d public inauentio.n. Quite
frankly Jthe Chicago Inter Ocean de
clared Mr. Misch's comedy above the

Â« They simply "'did not understand."

"A German Shakespeare," though the

there is much reason to dub Misch.

night. <'haracters. all flesh and blood
under their chitons, convincing in their
most fantastic extravagance, likable
la all their weaknesses, posed in de
lieiously absurd comedy rising to finest
poetry, stalked the stage. The atmos
phere was a? familiar ap it was de
lightsome. Aery soon in the course of
the piece it was evident of what it was
reminiscentâ and that most honorably
of Shakespearean comedy.
In no phase of the play is this more
to be felt than in the loving fashion in
which the dramatist has dealt with the
foibles of his people. You must like
them, even the gormandizing Manes,
while you laugh at them. It is a sweet
hearted view, the view of a man in
love wi'h his kind, that the dramatist
takes throughout. Hi? subject, more
over, the eternal duel of sex, invites
to easy vitriolism. Mr. Shaw has
made it the target of some of his dead
liest wit â in "Man and Superman"; Ib
son. the text of some of his sternest
satire. But here, of the story of the
Greek warriors stranded among Ama
zons, finding themselves ignominious
captives of the wo-men warriors and
finally, subduing them by love, the
German dramatist has fashioned his
play with a wit a? keen as Mr.
Shay '<=. an insight into human nature
â if from the other side â as acute as
Ibsen's, and besides, to these a poetry
unapproachable.
The drama has. too. the same wide
and apparently permanent appeal as
the Shakespearean drama. Its fun
v.r.uid have been just as good fun to
the srronprilinif at the Globe Theater
300 years ago as it was to you and me
this week. That it needs no pickle to
laÂ«t for Knottier 9M years would also
Been to be apparent. For the comedy
is built upon permanent factors in the
human ra^e and in the broadest fash
ion. Mr. illsch's figures, even to the
le.Tst of them, have a fashion of stand
ing out of the canvas in a way that
noes not exactly remind of. say. Mr.
Fitch's Manes, though he does smell
of Falstnf. IfalvoUo, too. perdie. is
real in th* sen^e in which these are
real, to the measure of his importance.
Peleazar. the one grotesque male of
Halcyone (the Amazon island) that
6ne is permitted to see. is another dis
tinguished instance. And Antiope â
what may one not say of the firm, del
icate, sensitively poetic treatment of
this truly exquisite figure? It seems to
me that there will be Antiopes of his
tory as there are Juliets, and fighting
faction? as to their rival worth.
Much Mr. ftliscfa owes to the in
tei|H<eleiS of his? play this week at the
California Mis^ Angiin has returned
to hr former :n<ui'?r of high comedy
with all imaginable grace. There was
an nvennodern touch in the earlier
s last Monday nicht. but her per
formance has s-inc-e risen to the classic
key in which the beautiful love scene
was so hartpilv pitched. Loveliest pa
ganism is this. Miss Angiin ideal in
â¢icture of the queen, yielding to
the charm of the night and of love. She
is throughout wonderfully effective,
particularly in the noetic suggestion.
A truiv charming note is that struck
by Blanche Btoddard, who, as the
spirit of Halcyone. delivers the pro
h'frijA. MrÂ«. Whiffen has a pretty mo
ment, and there is a glittering
"cboros** of femininity with helmets

ber of the Hakyonean population, is
excellent, and Hall McAllister. Edward

spend much conscience and ability on
f-mnll parts.

SHAKESPEARE AT
COLUiWBIA THEATER
The long-looked-for engagement of E.
H. Sothern and Julia Marlowe in
Shakespearean plays will begin to-mor
row evening at the Columbia. It is one
of the most notable of the season and
will doubtless attract the wide atten
tion it deserves. Miss Marlowe has not
been here for many years, but the en
thusiastic favor that she aroused dur
ing her last engagement is siill in live
iy evidence. The actress is now. with
Ada Rehan. among the foremost wo
men interpreters of Shakespearean
partF. and by the most worthy testi
mony is now at the height of her
achievement. She will appear in the
part with which she has been most im
portantly identified, that of Juliet, and
also as Beatrice and Ophelia.
Mr. Sothern's Hamlet is already as
well known as it is heartily admired
here. He will make his local debut as
Romeo, the part having been added to
Mr. Sothern's repertoire only this sea
son, and will also be seen here for the
first time in his local history as Bene
dick.
It is saidâ though this remains to be
seen â that there has been provided an
excellent company in support of Miss
Marlowe and Air. Sothern, and that the
settings of the plays are a delightful
satisfaction in themselves. "Much Ado
About Nothing " is the first of the plays
to be presented, and will run for the
first four nights. Friday and Saturday
e\enings and Saturday matinee will be
given over to "Hamlet," the "Romeo
and Juliet" coming the second week of
the engagement. It is to be noted that
the curtain will rise at 7:45 in the even
ings and at 1:45 at the matinees.
At the California, too, as is elsewhere
noted, there is a production of first im
portance in "The Eternal Feminine."
The- production has aroused an extraor
dinary interest, the theater being
crowded throughout the whoie week.
The piece will 'run most of this week
and will be followed by "Mariana. " a
Spanish play by the celebrated dram
atiei, Jose Echegaray.
The Alcazar will have a Fitch play
this week, "The Stubbornness of Ger
aldine," first presented here by Mary
Mannering. and now for the first time
presented here in stock. The deck of
an ocean liner is one of the novelties ot
the scenic settings, and the play has
much of the usual Fitch smartness anu
attraction.

UNINITIATED PREFER THE FOREIGN PICTURES
Art dealers in San Francisco, with
the exception of one, or possibly two,
deal but gingerly In local art. Why?
The reason is simple enough. People
who know but little of art â but who
feel the need of picturesâ lack the dis
cernment and the stamina to make a
choice- of pictures from California
studios. The charmed word "imported"
bears to them a sort of guarantee for
w r orth and distinction, much as it does
to a gown. An imported gown may
be a fright, a Jangle of color and bear
all ths^indices of being "dowdy"; but,
having been builded abroad, it must
of necessity be the proper caperâ and
so it is with pictures. "Imported" is
the talisman that charms the unin
itiated.
But let us cheer up! There's light
ahead! With the education of the peo
ple to the appreciation of Western
talent â and the process goes on with
every worthy art exhibit we, put forth
â the fetish of Europeanism will iose
its power.
Western art and European art both
should stand upon their values without
prejudice or favor to either. And this
will comeâ some day.

vals to be given for the benefit of the
teachers' annuity fund. On every af
ternoon and evening of this week, in
cluding Sunday next, a concert will
be given, the Mechanics' Pavilion be
ing the scene of operations. By the
comparative sizes of the type em
ployed in mentioning them Innes'
band would seem to be the principal
attraction of the festival, though not
unimportantly a local chorus of 1000
adult voices under the able direction
of Dr. H. J. Stewart, and a monster
chorus of children's voices directed by
Miss Kstelle Carpenter will take a
modest rjart. These choruses have
been rehearsing long and faithfully
and should the Innes band live up to
its advertisement there should be
some music worth hearing. Several
soloists come with the band, among
them Mrs. Partridge, soprano; F. M.
Huttmann, tenor; F. Archamb&ult,
barytone; Bohumir Kryl. cornetist.
Mrs. Lulu Snider-Johnson of local
fame will resist.
The most important w-ork to be giv
en will be the Mendelssohn "Hymn of
Praise," that will be sung next Thurs
day evening by the foregoing soloists
and chorus. Dr. H. J. Stewart will
direct. Other choral compositions to
be given are "Hail. Bright Abode,"
"Tannhauser"; the "Hallelujah Cho
rus," "Messiah"; "Bridal Chorus,"
If San Franciscans would get closer
to their artists â visit them in their
studios, and grow to know their work â
there would be a widening of the art
vision of the people. Moreover, their
perceptions of art requirements and
fulfillments would grow, and the city
would come to be a nursery of art â
which nature has designed it to be.
It is a matter of joy to me to record
the sales, of late, of canvases of Sidney
Yard, the water colorist; Thad Welch,
Giuseppe Cadenasso. H. W. Hansen,
Amodee Jouillin, Ada Romer Shawhan,
L. P. Latimer and* William Keith. Of
these. Yard's. Cadenasso's and Han
sen's were purchased by Eastern buy
ers, who. by the way, are most enthu
siastic admirers of the worthy work of
local painters â mind you, I say
"worthy" work â not potboilers, for
these Eastern folk know a thing or two
about art.
The elements they like in the work of
the West are its freshness, its virility,
its breath of the openâ its freedom and
originalityâ and its general absence of
"cant."

a little pool of water in a glen, the
trees on the bank throwing their shad

. The Sequoia Club will be two years
â¢ old next "Wednesday, when it will have
a. birthday party, as befits any inter
! esting entity that passes through the
wobbly period of infancy, and reaches
a second anniversary.
That a club of such varying elements
should survive the stress of the teeth
ing and creeping period is evidence of
its vitality, and likewise is it evidence
of the excellence of its nursing, which j
fell to the hands of a worthy board of
directors.
"Â» There were wise people who, two i
rears ago, prophesied an early and pic- j
turesque death of so idealistic a club.
'Tush' Tush!" said they. "How can j
women fraternize in a club? God |
t didn't make tbt>m that way."
Well, the best proof of the matter is ;
that the women have proved them- \
selves clubable;. workable and even
companionable â just ask the men about j
it, and they'll fell you what trumps the
women were in fixing up things in the :
new clubhouse and taking hold gen- j
- erally. ;.:,-; : . â¢ '
Since the club has assumed the dig- j
nity of a householder inquisitive neigh
bors are asking: what it's all about.
Simply this: The Sequoia stands for
|he encouragement of painting:, sculp- '
ture, music and literature, in that a I
large part of its members are expo
cents or patrons of these arts.
But â listen!â in no pedantic i
manner is this interest made manifest, \
/or the first and vital "cause" of the j
club is goodfellowship. Now. .this
"good&pllowship 'twixt men and women
is of a type unknown to clubdom out
here in the West, and therefore does it
hold a unique place.
Then, the- furnishings of the new
clubroonsEâ quite the prettiest, coziest
c and simplest furnishings one could con
o jure up, emphasize its individuality.
On the club's roster are -several arti
sans, and it was by these clever chaps'
hands that every bit of furniture was
planned and made, much of it being
c fashioned by Professor Meyer of the
applied arts of the Hopkins School of
> Design. and by the Arts and Crafts
people. "Sequoia" wood, by the 'way, is
liberally used in the accouterments of
the rooms.
And the curtains, who do- you guess
made them?, Why, the ladies, bless
them!â they hemstitched and embroid
ered every bit of the drapery in the
rooms, supplied the doylies and all the
little femininities that make of the
dubrooms a club home. ">-â¢"â¢
There, you grumpy iconoclasts, what
have you to say about women not being
clubable? â¢ *
i 'Twas a beautiful time, the night of
e the dubrooms' christening, when the
neighborly Trench Club threw open its
doors to the Sequoians.
And it was a smart crush, with a
lot of stunning gowns and interesting
omenâ not marvelously beautiful wo
men, but interesting. â¢
To the following members, compos
ing the board of directors, Is due the
credit for piloting the club through the
tremulous -period of its babyhood:

URGE KOSTER
FOR BRIGADIER
Aa effort is being made in the Na
tional Gnard to have a San Francisco
man appointed brigadier general of
ihc Second Brigade so that the bri
gade headquarter? shall be located in
this city. As yet no indication has ap
peared as to who will be the choice of
the appointing power, but the friends
of Qolonel Koster are hopeful that he
will be the appointee.
Colonel Wilhelm returned to this
city last week, having concluded his
tour of inspection of the guard on
behalf of the War Department and of
the State. He is now preparing his
report
Colonel H. I. Seymour, temporarily
in command of the Second Brigade,
lias issued an order detailing Major
Kelly to preside at an election for cap
tain, first and second lieutenant of
Company E, and Major Eggert to pre
side at an election for captain of Com
pany D of the First Infantry.
It is stated that as soon as the new
guard is in "good working order"
there will be many changes in the per
sonnel of several of the organizations.
Captain Grattan of Battery B, First
Artillery, will visit Petaluma to-day
to make arrangements with Captain
Dickson of Company C of the Fifth
for a bivouac by the battery and com
at Stony Point and a skirmish
drill.
It having been positively asserted that
there is to be no camp this year. Com
panies I of Livermore and B of San
Jose, Fifth Infantry, are making ar
rangements for an eight days' outing.
The men in heavy marching order will
go by rail from their respective loca
tions to Los Gatos and from there
march to Capitola, bivouacking on the
road to and from Los Gatos.
Twenty-five men from Company D
of San Rafael, Captain Vanderbilt
commanding, and a like number from
Company C of Petaluma, Captain
Dickson commanding, will meet at the
Stony Point range to-day to shoot the
first of three matches for a trophy.
The officers of the First Infantry
gave a ball in the headquarters of the
regiment on Page street last Friday
night in celebration of the seventh an
niversary of the call to arms. There
wag a large and fashionable attend
ance and a good order of dances to
delightful music. The floor manager
was Lieutenant E. F. Peckham, as
sisted by Captain H. G. Stind and Lieu
tenant F. A. Marriott. Captain H. G.
Mathewson was the chairman of the
committee of arrangements, which was
composed of Lieutenants J. O'Keefe,
E. F. Peckham, S. O. Beasley and W.
H. Talbot. Lieutenant Colonel T. J.
McCreagh served as the chairman of
the reception committee and was
assisted by Majors J. F. Eggert and W.
X. Kelly, Chaplain J. McQuaide. Cap
tain W. E. Wehser and Lieutenants
Alexander McCulloch and D. A.
Hagens.
At a recent assemblage of Company
D of the Fifth Infantry at San Rafael
there was an exhibition drill for the
purpose of demonstrating the -changes
in the new drill regulations. There
were many ex-members present and
they enjoyed the mistakes that were
made in carrying out the new regula
tions. The drill was followed by a
presentation by Lieutenant Uoysen,
acting for Colonel Hayes, to the com
pany of the trophy or regimental cup
offered in 1901 to the company win
ning it three consecutive times in tar
get shooting. This event was followed
by dancing, there being present a large
number of ladies.

Attorney Spinetti declares he does
not desire to impede In any way the
efforts of the police in tracing the wom

st-es no good reason why she should be
deprived of her Mberty. She is anxious
to return to the home of her parents
in New Orleans, and the Italian La

Captain Burnett says that the case
of Mrs. Torturici will be laid before
the Grand Jury to-morrow, and it will
be for that body to take action. If she
is indicted she will be detained for
trial, but if not she will be set at lib

Policeman John W. Evatt, who went

noon: "The prisoner here is not Tortu

A search is being made continually
for Torturici in the district occupied by
the Italian colony in the hope that he
may return, but the efforts of the po

BUYING FARMS
FOR THE POOR
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, April 29.â There seem? to
be no doubt about the success of the
various "unemployed colonies" which
the British local government board is
establishing, with the aid of Joseph
Fels of Philadelphia.
An opportunity was given newspaper
men this week to visit the most im
portant of these "colonies" â at Hollee
ley Bay. on the sea coast in Suffolk â
and all that was seen there bore evi
dence of the value of the American
Socialist's idea.
That idea is, of course, to give the
unemployed who at present are crowd
ing: the London poorhouses a chance to
earn their "keep" by agricultural work
in the country- With this object Fels
is acquiring derelict farms throughout
the country and turning them over rent
free for three years to the local gov
ernment board. The first he acquired
was Sumpner's farm of 100 acres in Es
sex, which cost the American manu
facturer $10,625 and is now in the hands
of the Poplar Board of Guardians.
The men from the London work
houses are sent to these farms and set
at work reclaiming them. Single men
get only their board and no wages;
married men. besides being "found."
are paid $3 75 a week, but are allowed
only sixpenceâ l 2 centsâ a week for
themselves, the balance being sent to
their wives in London. The farms
which the men are reclaiming, under
the directnion of practical agricultur
ists, will, of course, increase greatly in
value when they become productive
once more. At the end of three yeara
they will be purchasable by the au
thorities, otherwise they will revert to
Fels, who makes no pretense that his
offer to the local government board is
wholly philanthropic.
The Hollesley colony is said to be
typical of the rest. It comprises 1300
acres, and on these are now working
125 men who five weeks ago were num
bered with the horde of unemployed in
London. Dockers. carpenters and
bricklayers for the most by trade. They
were found double-digging the ground
and sowing rows of potatoes, onions
and asparagus. At the end of every
month they are allowed to go to Lon
don and look for work at their own
trade. If they fail to find it in the
course of time there is a good chance
for them in the country at their new
calling, agricultural labor being In de
mand.
At Hollesley farm it Is said that the
"unemployed laborers" are not recog
nizable as the same beings as when
they came from liondon slums. Then
they were wild-eyed and half-starved.
Now, well fed, the unmistakable glow
of health is on their faces.
"During their first few days," said
one of the overseers, "the men seem
simply to want to eat and eat. Of
bread there is no stint, and one batch
of men actually ate forty loaves fewer
in their second week than in their
first."
Of course, these unemployed colonies
do not pay, but the authorities expect
to get some of their money back by
making the farms supply the vegeta
bles for the workhouses under their
control. On all sides the experiment is
pronounced a success, and it is worth
noticing that Fels" offer to buy up
derelict land for reclamation applies
to tho United States or any other coun
try where there are able-bodied pau
pers who are willing to work.

MR. GARFIELD'S ADDRESS.
THE students of the State University are especially favored by
the opportunity to hear what may be said about the great
sues of life by men who have taken them soberly and have
\ed -careers useful to their country and creditable to them
selves. Such a man i- Mr. James (iarfield. He need take noth
ing by lineage as the son of a distinguished statesman, for his way
in the world has been won and his honors gained by his individ
uality, quality and character.
Hi* address to the students on Friday was on a theme that
\ uppermost in the pubHc mmd â the political duties of good
nstlip. All around us lies evidence that these duties have been
neglected. The instances of official malfeasance, which are so fre
quently exposed ami which arouse the solicitude of citizens, are,
after all. due to a failure to esteem properly the duties of citizen
ship. If those duties were taken as seriously as they deserve, the
official morals of the country would immediately improve, and public
trusts would be better placed and more faithfully administered. He
well said That "ye need the courage to do right and to do right to
the bitter end," accepting all of the burdens and responsibilities that
sre necessary to perseverance in right doing.
Without this determination in the citizen, popular government
is the least permanent of all forms. When vigilance is relaxed all of
its processes are liable to suffer from dishonesty and disorder, and
all of its powers to such abuse as undermines the whole structure.
It is a serious matter, deserving the instant attention of freemen if
they would perpetuate their institutions. There is no programme
of novelties that will take the place of civic spirit and personal
honesty. Socialistic denunciations of government, and ararchistic
attempts to destroy it. are but the remedies of fanatics and madmen.
rmnent should govern and do nothmg else. Its purpose is the
r policing oi the conduct of individuals, and the legal regula
tion Â«>f property and its uses. When it is said that these functions
have become impossible and that the Government must cease to
m, and become the owner and operator of that which it ought
em by regulation and control, then is the admission made that
g nment is a fiction, a myth, a thing impossible, an idle dream.
an impossible aspiration and a false hope.
The healthy optimism of Mr. Garfield is the proper attribute of
free men. In the past all national perplexities and problems of gov
ernment have been settled and their adjustment has been consistent
with free institutions and with the proper functions of government.
Â£a will it be in the future. Neither the autocrat nor the anarchist
will be permitted to destroy a structure of government builded to
m only.
Mr. Garficl<i's address was especially pertinent in view of con
ditions in our municipal government. Every man knows that the
fetid state of the city administration is due entirely to the complete
withdrawal of vigilance from local politics. Of old it was said in
the commonwealth oi Judca. "The prophets have prophesied falsely,
the priests bear rule thereby, and the people love to have it so. '
meaning that the people assented when they might have compelled
a chauge. There is a whole Sunday sermon on the local situation.
If the people love to have it as it is. if they assent to the election of
the unfit and the unworthy, the dishonest and immoral, they have
only themselves to blame. More than that, they are responsible for
putting opportunity within reach of the dishonest : they are riot
merely victims of the offense, they are sharers in its turpitude.
The quickened conscience of this city feels this responsibility
and is determined to bear it no more. In the past it has been sup
! that only a change in partisan control was necessary to
cleanse local administration. This has proved to be a fiction. It
has been demonstrated that the System which works corruption is
aw appendage of all parties. The only rational method of reform
i> by putting one party under such inspection and discipline as to
make it the assurance and instrument of proper and upright admin
istration. If other parties follow and apply the same discipline to
themselves it will be well. But there must be a starting point, a
place to rally those who have the courage to do right and to do it
t" the bitter end.
This start is made in San Francisco. It is not a passing fashion.
a flash of remorse for past neglect. It is a planned, determined and
permanent movement. Men have mounted guard to do duty until
others relieve them. The high mark set for their attainment is the
securing for San Francisco the best municipal government in the
Vnion. one that shall be above reproach and suspicion. The men
vho have joined to, ether in this purpose are optimistic. They
purp< ,ceed. They do not despair of reform. They feel their
power and intend its use. Sneers at them as "reformers who want
politicians and politicians who want to be reformers" do not
deter them. The public business is their business and they intend
to attend to it. though even grafter and conspirator against de
cenc\ in the city rave at them and lie about their motives.
THE STATE FARM.
THE country press is quite generally protesting against proposi
tions to give' to the State land for the experimental farm, for
which money Was appropriated by the Legislature. We are
inclined to agree with the country press. The farm is to be an
adjunct* of the Agricultural Department of the State University, and
the appropriation was made for it on the theory that its operation
is to b% beneficial to the agriculture and horticulture of the whole
State. . i i . Â° â 'â¢ â  -. â 'â ."â 
Spurred on by local ambition v communities are offering to do
nate tire required land. It is hardly possible that in the case of all
such offers Ibe motive is entirely disinterested. There is room in
such i. proposition for speculation in adjacent real estate, through
which ?i jeast.some of .-the contributors expect to get back their do
nations. But. granting that no such motive is involved, it is unbe
coming the dignity of the State tor accept from a few what is for
the benefit of all. If the people could be. heard on the subject it is
highly probable they would reject such a gift. The State of Califor
nia is not an object of charity. It does not have to go upon the
street hat in hand and solicit alms. It is no gaberlunzie man. de
pendent on the. bounty of the benevolent. If it is, the case should
be referred to* the Associated Charities to see whether the State is
a -worthy object and needs the assistance.
The law providing for this university farm requires a tract of
320 acre s. adapted to irrigation and with the means, therefor at
hand. If the commissioners, who are to make the selection, con
sider it as an investment in which the State is to get the worth of
its money, we are far more likely to get a proper location than if
those gentlemen are touched by the very human. disposition not to
look a gift horse in the mouth too critically.
We are of the opinion that the beneficial effect upon the com
munity in which this farm may be located is overestimated. It will
be of no more advantage than any well-tilled farm of the same
acreage. The immediate community will have no first call upon
the results of the experimental culture carried on upon th? land,
for that would violate the principle upon which the experimental
establishments, made. Let the Commissioners take time to make
the best possible -selection and then pay for it. as individuals do
when they want land. __^^_^^^^^^^
RAILWAY CASUALTIES.
DEATH and injury due to railway accidents are shown to be
an appalling hazard in this country by the Interstate Com
merce Commission reports for the last quarter of 1904. The
great extent of the danger as compared with the possibility of less
ening it. which is proved by the relative immunity from risk of the
travelers in Great Britain, makes it interesting to note how the dif
ficulty is proposed to be overcome as an engineering problem. This

A REUNITED DEMOCRACY.
SELFISHNESS IN MEN AND WOMEN
Much Trouble Will Be Avoided After Marriage by the Recognition of
Individual Rights.
Â«7rRE men more selfish than wo-
L\ men?" is a question a reader
"has asked me to discuss. If
the testimony given by heart-broken
wives in the divorce courts could be
tak^n as a criterion, there would be
little choice but to reply emphatically,
yes.
Often, as I have sat in court listening
to these distressing narratives, I have
been moved to condemn the entire
masculine contingent, unreservedly, as
selfish and unworthy to the last degree
âwholly undeserving the love, devo :
tion and sympathy of woman. But 1
realize, of course, that such wholesale
condemnation is unjust, that the stories
of woe which speak so eloquently of
masculine brutality mark the excep
tion and not the rule.
One cannot judge the sterner sex by
those of its representatives whose
wretched partners must fly to the
courts to obtain release from slavery..
There are all sorts and conditions of
men in this world, just as there are all
sorts and conditions of women.
Some men are so intensely selfish
they would inevitably make the life
of any woman, no matter how uncom
plaining, so completely miserable that
she would be compelled to seek release.
And there are women of the same
type who exact everything of the men
who marry them, and in return give
little but complaints and nagging.
Man's love for woman, in its very na
ture, is supposed to be of a more selfish
variety than her love for him. I do not
believe, however, that the idea obtains
to-day as it once did.
The species of man that regards
woman as his chattel is rapidly be
coming extinct. In this age man's
love for woman does not seek the form
of ownership so much as companion
is stated incidentally in a paper on applied science by Henry Harri
son Suplee in The Forum.
He says that the subject of railway accidents is a matter to be
dealt with by the applied science of engineering. He analyzes the
causes of railway slaughter and brings them all back to the funda
mental natural law that two bodies cannot occupy the same space
at the same time. The engineering remedy woulcLprovide an almost
absolute freedom from danger of collision by establishing a continu
ous traveling platform which would cover the entire track at ail
times. Although that solution is beyond our economic reach at the
present time, it is very satisfying to think that as our population
grows in density and the immensity of our travel and traffic increases,
instead of danger growing proportionately, safety will come more
and more as result of increase in travel as soon as we get to the
point where the continuous traveling platform will be profitable.
In the meantime the block system is so close an approximation
to the reality of the continuous platform idea that it would well
serve to carry us over the interval while we wait for the absolutely
collision-proof scheme. The block system as already used is perfect
in theory, that is. no more than one train must be on any one block
at any time : but as applied in fact it is found that the human ma
chine that uses it is so subject to weariness, to forgetfulness, to drink,
dream, and many errors of judgment, that it is far from being so sure
a life preserver as it should be. It is proposed to so improve the
system that it will work practically with the safety involved in
the continuous traveling platform. The method is to use mechanical
trip devices that will be beyond the control of the engineer on the
train, and make detached trains move in a continuous flow beyond
the exercise of indiscretion by either train dispatcher or engineer.
The importance of urging the early Adoption of the improvement
is shown by the figures of our annual accidents. To lump the esti
mates, some 85,000 people are injured or killed in a^ear. This is
ten times as many as are hurt in Great Britain and^ Ireland. We
have much more track mileage, but our train mileage is only about
two and a half times as great as that of the safer country. Really
our railway work and traveling is more dangerous to life and limb
than a big foreign war.

ship. Wives to-day are accorded great
er personal liberty than they ever were
â a larger existence is possible for them
than ever before.
I believe the average man. in these
modern days, is not more selfish than
the average woman. In my observa
tion it is the woman quite as often as
the man who causes domestic discord
by a selfish demonstration of affection.
Wives, quite as frequently as hus
bands, are exacting in their demands
and unreasonable in their expectations.
The" selfishness of the average wife
lies in the fact that she wants her hus
band to be happy according to the pat
tern she prescribes for him. She resents
it when he pursues his own ideals of
âCHICAGO INTKR OCEAN.
diversion and recreation â ideals which,
because strictly masculine, she fail? to
comprehend, and hence deems unnec
essary.
A great many wives ar^ deeply hurt
because their husband? fail to adjust
themselves to feminine ideals of hav
ing a K'">od time. Few wives are lib
eral and unselfish enough in their love
to be thoroughly glad in an interest
which the husband possesses outside
of the home Joys. I know a woman
who is. but she is one of the shining
exceptions. She is never jealous >f
her husband. Whatever makes him
happy rejoices her. The result is that
he has no interests outside of her. Sir" 1
shares them all.
By petty jealousies and narrowness
of view many wives arc themselves re
sponsible for beins: excluded from a
large measure of their husbands' lives.
The wife who is unselfish enough to
interest herself in the other side of
her husband's life is the one who does
not need to be constantly on the alert
in jealous fear lest he find happiness
away from her
If, aft* 3 ?- marriage, men and women
both would agree to regard each other
as individuals with certain ind^puta
ble rights, just as they regarded each
other nefore the ceremony, there would
be less bondage and more real Joy in
the union. It is difficult for husbands
to realize the rights of a wife as an
individual. Here is where mans self
ishness usually crops cut.
A husband is both selfish and tyran
nical who presumes to dictate to his
wife in matters that concern her as
an individual. Before marriage h^
would rot have dared to raise his voice
concerning her personal affairs. After
marriage he should show h#r the same
courtesy.

SNEEZES A BULLET.
Colonel Sidney G. Cooke. local man- '

Rome, probably is the only man in the
world who ever sneezed a bullet out
of his head, says the Leavenworth
Times. He was badly wounded at
the battle of the Wilderness, a Con
federate bullet having penetrated his â 
brain. He was taken prisoner and â 
sent to Andersonville. after having '
his wound dressed by a doctor, who j
did not attempt to extract the bullet.
Cooke recovered, and the lead In his :
"noggin" did not bother him at all. |
One day he commenced to sneeze and
he nearly sneezed himself to death.
He sneezed for ten days. With the
last sneeze came the bullet.
WHIMS OF MIRANDA
A. M. D. OGDEN
was afternoon on one of the last
few hot days of summer. Throusrh
the open windows came glimpses of
greenwood bespeaking a delicious cool
ness and the ripple of brooks, but In
the schoolroom the air was undeniably
close. The scratch of a pencil, the
shuffling of impatient little feet, the
drone of a lazy bee. all seemed to in
tensify the impression of htttt. and the
young schoolmaster stirred restlessly.
It had meant a great deal to Peter
Raymond, securing the village school
at Wimberly. But he had not found
his task an easy one. His eyes, wan
dering over the rows of bent heads
before him. encountered the glance of
a girl seated near the dor. The girl,
one of the oldest scholars, with a toss
of her curls, returned to her book, and
the trouble in the schoolmasters face
deepened. Here was the crux of the
situation. If. he could win Miranda
Hemming to his side, the remainder of
the pupils would follow easily enough.
But it was Miranda herself, with her
great blue eyes, fetching dimples and
coquettish ways, who openly led the
revolt against him. The teacher signed
again; perhaps he was too young.
From the very beginning of his work,
however. Raymond had recosrnlzed the
primitive instinct of hostility to the un
known in the questioning eyes uDllfted
to his own. Now. after five weeks, he
seemed no nearer the solution of his
problem; indeed, matters under Miran
da's spirited guidance were becoming
even worse, despite his pointed, ignoring
of her mutiny. He touched the bell.
"First class in grammar." he said.
Miranda with several other zirls. rang
ing from sixteen to eighteen, came
slowly forward. It was rather a trvine
recitation. Most of the girls stumbled.
Miranda failed utterly. Nor did she
care. To all his questions she answered
with provoking nonchalance, evidently
indifferent as to whether he were
pleased or not. Her rebellion had never
before been quite so openly manifest.
A sudden line of resolution tightened
the young man's mouth.
"You may return to your seats." he
said. "HIM Miranda. I shall expect you
to remain after school until that lesson
Js recited perfectly."
"What!" cried the girl. Involuntar
ily she fell back a step, hardly believ
ing 1 her own ear?. That any one should
dare addresp her. Miranda Hemming,
in such fashion. Raymond's express
ion did not change.
"You heard what I said," he return
ed quietly. 'It should not take long."
For a moment Miranda, stupefied,
hesitated, then she flounced indignant
ly back to her seat. The whole school,
which had dropped all work to listen
to the passage at arms between Miran
da and the teacher, fairly shivered, and
Tom Carruthers. a big loutish chap of
nineteen, shot a sullen look at Ray
mond. To scold Miranda! To the
quivering excitement of the school the
time until 4 o'clock appeared fairly
to fly. Would teacher really keep in
Miranda ?
When the others arose Miranda also
sprang to her feet, then something in
the teacher's expression caused her to
sink back in her seat, tingling and
abashed. It took an unusually long*
time for the pupil? to disperse that
day. hut at last they were all gone.
"You need not think that I shall
study that lesson." she declared with
sharp emphasis. Raymond nodded.
'As you please. " he answered. "Only
here we both stay until you do."
"And I'm not to have any supper?"
incredulously.
â¢ Not until you learn that lesson."
"But â " burst out Miranda furiously.
Then she closed her Mvp with a snap
i and leaned back, her hands tempestu
1 ously folded before her. Raymond
picked up a book.
"Take your own time." he said pleas
antly.
But somehow the book did not prove
I very enthralling. Between his eyes
and the printed pages persisted the
vision of a willful little face, set in its
; tangle of wavy hair. Yet he must not
be beaten now. His whole future
; hung on this issue, he thought. The
shadows lengthened, the sun dropped
: behind the hills. Miranda, who for
some time had been stealing furtive
! glances at the quiet figure behind the
( big desk, smiled prettily.

For an instant Raymond wavered.
This new sweetness was strange and
alluring. But before he could speak
j the door was flung open and Tom
: Carruthers appeared on the threshold.
"Bent ye coming home to supper.
' Mlrandy?" he demanded. "Yer ma sent
! me fer ye." darting a suspicious look
:at her jailer. "Ain't ye coming? I'll
â¢ look out fer ye."
"Why," began Miranda, feebly. Ray
mond, a sudden, unaccountable resent
ment surging into his heart, frowned.
"Miss Miranda is in no need of a
1 champion, ' he declared stiffly. "She
can leave when she chooses. You may
I go.' And Tom, after an instants
I scowling hesitation, went out. banging
i the door. Miranda bit her lip.
'I will never learn that lesson." she
â  repeated stubbornly.
There was another long silence while
; the shadows darkened. At last the
i young man rose and lit the lama
"It Is nearly nine o'clock." hÂ» said
! briefly. Miranda, now close upon tears,

"And if I say it you'll let me aro~'
"Certainly."
With rapid, choked utterances she
flung the text at him, not pausing for

"Iâ l hate you." she cried vehemently.

I The world was flooded with the tran

where a row of maples lifted their
leafy branches to the starry skies, and
"I shall expect yon to remain."
Raymond, fancying that he caught the
gleam of a white dress there under the
â¢ trees, fe-lt his heartbeats quicken.
I Somehow he had been looking forward
to walking home with the girl. Then
as he turned from locking the door a
dark figure rushed by the corner of th<?
schoolhouse, there was a woman s
shrill scream, something heavy struck
his forehead and Raymond fell.
It must have been nearly an hour
later when Raymond and Mlranttn
stopped at the gate of the girl's home.
Hearing footsteps, Mrs. Hemming camp
out to meet them. Â«
"Well," she said. "So I hear you've

"Trust you. " cried Mrs. Hemming.
"Why, you're nothing but a boy your

*â¢ for no other reason than to discover
' something' of the quality which makes
n this praise place it close to being a
model of American novel-writing.
\, * Setting aside the praise and consid
< wring the story just as an example in
the analysis of the art of fiction as
practiced by American writers, it is
seen through this popular novelist's
eyes to combine in itself two contend
ing tendencies in our national fiction.
One of these is the trend toward be
coming so short and so light that it
â  ill be worth no able man's time to
write one. The other is to go back to
the old classic proportions of such
â models as were given us in the greater
â¢ English- n- --els of Thackeray.' Fielding
c Â« and George Eliot.
â In "Hecla Sandwith" Valentine- laid
the foundations well. for a novel of
, the longer and more elaborate and
serious type, but he built upon this
broad, foundation the superstructure,
of the light, short type of American
â¢ novel and cut short the dramatic pre
i - sentation of the characters he had se
lected to portray. Although there were
fume three c four love stories to de
"velop, he does it air in about four
hundred pages.
For praise" of the book it is said
that from end to end the reader en
counters only rational psychology of
thought and emotion, that its choice
of' theme was a great American one;
, that the writer based the worth of his
work Â» upon theÂ» dramatic portrayal of
human character; that when he turns
â¢ from human life to descriptions of Na
ture that environs It his pages are of
surpassing beauty; that when it comes
, to the art of delivering his vision to
others he shows extraordinary liter
ary quality, and that he combines
with the selection of a great story to
tell sufficient reverence for his art
to let us hear the story in language
molded after the standards ofo the
highest English style. This praise is
qualified, though, by saying that the
book is unevenly written, the fineness
is not omnipresent through the pages.
The scene of the novel is laid in
Pennsylvania, in 1856 and among pio
d neers who are developing the mineral
wealth of the mountains. * The people
are Scotch-Irish and the principal
characters are Quakers. Hecla Sand
"with is the daughter of a Quaker
Ironmaster. Joshua Sandwith, a
strong, stern man,* who has retired
from active business because he is in
valided by an internal tumor. He has
' named Hecla after his â¢ favorite fur
nace. She is devoted to him. Out of
this devotion comes the passionate
v pain of the chief of the several love
stories. . ,-' ; ."*- v
The girl when but fifteen had a ter
rible impression made upon her mind
by witnessing the death of her mother
from premature childbirth, caused by
fright In a lightning storm. From
this came, later- in womanhood, an ab
normal feeling about . wifehood. She
has two lovers. One is her cousin,
whom she will not marry because her
father - has the Quaker prejudice
against such unions. The other is a
strong purposed. English mining ex
pert, whom she marries from a sense
ot duty, but without loving. She has
a half- brother of ignoble character
who is managing their mining prop
erty and for him she suffers much be
cause eofc of wounded family pride and
ruin of property. There is an estrange
ment between her and her husband
which puts both characters to a severe
test. There are interesting minor char
acter studies surrounding these five.
Such is the story in bare outline.
Hecla's character is early developed
into a feeling of responsibility because
her father leaned upon her affection
after her mother's death, and because
she had the care .of the little mother
lew child born at the time of the
mother's tragedy. She is beautiful, but
has no strong attachment to the
Quaker or any religion. She discovers
early In herself a desire for control.
She had a face , full of melancholy
thought fulness. Her eyes were wide
set under a smooth brow, and the in
heritance of her father's firmness show
ed in the mold of her mouth. ' At the
time she attracted her English lover.

tragic, full of intelligence. The clear
brow from which the red-brown hair

an ideal purity, like thf features, fleli

After this sight of her came passion

man who for long marred but later
made her happiness. Because, of the
dreams, he felt a strange sense of near- I
ness to the woman with whom he had \
barely exchanged a word. Then the |
wish f<->r her possession grew in him j
as a supreme necessity. So begins ths j
study of the principal masculine char- !
acter. and evidently Valentine intends
'to portray a strong man. At least this

him as weak, but as he won we call
him strong.

j separate houses.
Later, estrangement comes over busi
ness matters. Hecla thinks her hus
band, for love of her, should take
charge of the Sandwith property,
; which her half-brother was misman
: aging. Hallett holds that he is honor
bound to give all his time and talents
to the enterprise he had advised and
' undertaken for others. The crisis of
estrangement between these two strong
natures came thus: Hecla dislikes his
friend. Hallett firmly says he will not
give up his frierds even at his wife's
dictation. "Then," said the angry wo

Hecla Sandwith and her two lovers

breaking: point, that he knew she loved
her cousin. Hecla was weak enough
to marry from sense of duty and a
passivity to an overmasterful man, al
though love by its absence left the act

Such is the thread of fact on which
Valentine has strung what James Lane

young authoT has been all too brief
in handling to develop the possibilities
of ii= treatment in a fully dignified and
ennobling way. It is a tjieme, he
thinks, a George Eliot might have
chosen, and evidently he wishes Valen

wrought out its psychology in a novel
. of such length and elaboration as to
deliver the full effect of a strong writ

time of an attentive reader to get all

"ISIDRO," A NOVEL
BY MRS. AUSTIN
The Ppanish-American period of Cal
ifornia history' furnished a wealth of
material out of which to manufacture
romantic fiction. That it is an unex
hausted mine in that way has just
been proved. Fortunately we have a
California novelist who knows the old
history so intimately, has lived amid
the scenery of It so observantly and
appreciatively and has such creative
imagination, power of description and
gift of pleasing language that she can
make a story of California so fascinat
ing it could be wisely picked out for
absorbing literary entertainment from
a bunch of new books representing all
land? of the globe. Mrs. Mary Austin,
In her new story, "Isidro," exercises all
th^se powers in a verveful way which
will no doubt be a delight to many
readers.

its location of scene and its luxuriance
of climate-nourished genius for strong ,
and beautiful expression, that should
be a double recommendation to Cal- â 
ifornians who are looking for a good !
spring story to read. It is a book ,
which makes you feel as if you had j
been there â in the race, for instance, |
from that fire in the Forest of Hidden ;

I ablaze to drive from their stronghold
the renegades who had captured his :
daughter; and in the meadow, watch
ing the duel of riatas between two ex
pert ropers at enmity because of love
of the girl Jacinta, who also watched
while her lover's circling rawhide
hummed in the air, kept there by
whirling force of motion, and the hand
of its owner "bid it follow the mestizo
like a questing snake"; on the plains,'
when the drunken shepherds fought
with knives to the death, and the see
ing the Portuguese fall forward "with
a wet cough, and the poppies, drowned
in blood, shrank all away from him";
and thence with the flock of shepherd
| less Bheep as they were instinctively
I herded by the dogs, Noe and Reina
Maria, through grass and bloom and
wood and canyon until Isidro, the pic- I
turesque hero of the story, met them;
and on till Isidro comes upon the still
more picturesque El Zarzo, the Briar,
flower couched, ready with words, and
at the age of eager and expectant life
awaiting, shepherding a little flock j
where the grass grew up tall and muf- j
fled the bells of the sheep; lying un- '
der a tree in the far woods, even as
Eric Vape has pictured her in the j
frontispiece of the book. El Zarzo la ';
what makes the life of Isidro a stir- i
ring story, and so It is well we are!
given a look at the prepossessing fig
ure at the very start.
It is here Isidro first sees the youth
ful shepherd. Isidro is young and rich,
but on his way to become a priest at
one of the old missions. Finding the
flock of the murdered shepherd, he
thinks it suite the priestly character to
care for it till he locates its owner. So
comes the gayly clad Castillan horse- I
man upon his first interesting adven
ture, late in the day when he is tired
and hungry. "By this time the light '
had got a yellow tinge from shining j
slantwise on the poppy fires. Under an j
oak, mocking the jays with a shrill \
voice, sat a slim, dark lad, pillowed on j
a great sheaf of plucked bloom." Later
we learn further of this very vital crea
ture's appearance, that El Zarzo was
"boyish enough to look at, lithe and
slim, with hair, straight as the fine
slant wires of rain, falling on either
cheek below the round, firm chin."
As for the horseman, Isidro Escobar, i
the Briar* found him so fascinating and
companionable that next morning the
pair rode away together toward the
mission. If Isidro was going to serve
God and see the world, very good; so
El Zarzo said, "1 also serve God and j
see the world." Out of this desire of
El Zarzo to serve God and see the
world, and be close companion to Esco
| bar, came complications later on, in
j which were romantically mixed up pa-
I dres of the old missions, proud and
wealthy families of -Castilian blood,;
comandantes, Indians, mestizos and
Portuguese shepherds.
Briefly, but most vividly, we are told
1 of how Jacinta, daughter of the rich j
Cantilian, Castro, came to be born of
the young girl, Ysabel, who was in no
vitiate to be bride of the holy church
till Castro's passion changed the plaps
of the padres; of how the young bride |
hated her husband and concealed the
fact of her motherhood f ror* Hrrr- !Â»*â¦ it

should make him too happy. So the
child born of most passionate love on
the one side and of cold dislike on the
other gets lost. The main argument of
the book consists l of the finding of her.
Now, there are too many pages which
sho^v the touch of the fine, strong hand
of literary distinction to be called at
tention to here, but on the subject of
this love of Castro's for his unwilling
bride let us take a sample. Castro's
Boul and body so cried out for her that
he would have her, or die. However, it
was Ysabel who died; not, though, till
she had answered the Castilian's pas
sion with a child, fortunately for the
old age of the unloved husband, for Ja
cinta comes to him like a gift andÂ«a
pardon from heaven at the last.
In the early chapters the author's
art inclines us to hate the husband who
had snatched an unwilling bride, and
to despise him in sympathy with the
bride's dislike of her bonds. After
the long twenty years had passed over
the grave of the girl, the writer
seems moved with compassion for tlfe
passion of the willful but terribly
punished lover. Here is where he rec
ognizes his long lost daughter:
"He saw the cord that held the metal
about her slender throat. 'What is this,
daughter?' he said, with his hand upon
I her shoulder, yearning toward the
proper Intimacy of their relation and
not daring much. I have always worn
it,' she said. 'It belonged to my bap
tism.' Castro drew It out and held it
in his palm, warm from her bosom.
| Then he knew it for Tsabel's and
i thrilled to it as to a living touch of her.
He kissed It, murmuring to it broken
words of endearment, and laid his head
upon the railing before him, kneeling
lon the floor, and cried. The girl was
in a mood to be touched by his grief;
tears filled her eyes, brimmed over
and ran abroad on her cheeks as not

tears were purely hysterical, but

with his and washed the wounds of her

into the mainland than any other
where can be made a good ice-free
port. It is the key to the Copper River
district, which is estimated to hold
enormous undeveloped wealth, only
waiting for good roads to make its ex
ploitation feasible. The place is very
beautiful.
"Snow-capped mountains rise precip
itously on either side, from whose white
summits unnumbered glaciers slide
slov/ly and silently into the valleys be
tween, while from beneath these im
mense fields of ice and snow beautiful
cascades break down over the moun
tain~fronts and leap from ledges into
the sea like showers of molten silver.
Only one glacier, the Columbian, de
livers lte frozen stream 'uto i*Â« wm.
but its cold and pllttering front, white
streaked with deep blue, rises like a
solid wall straight across the valley
through which it emerges from the
mountain slopes behind. The air Is
moist from the constant melting of the
snow, and even when th? skies are
cloudless, is filled with a soft, blue haze
which adds an indescribable charm to
the scene."
In telling of the Russian settlements
an account is given of that remark
able figure. Alexander Baranoff. whose
character and career were recently
made use of in the California novel,
"The Way of the North." It is said
of the forceful Russian that he es
teemed himself a chosen agent of di
vine Providence to carry out its pur
poses. Although he sometimes ap
peared a bullying and drunken roy
storer he was loved by children and
respected for his ability.
The account given of the reindeer
industry, fostered by the Government.
Is most interesting, and shows that in
that, and in the possibilities of agricul
ture in Alaska, there Is fine prospect
to greatly reduce the cost of living and
travel while developing the mineral
wealth of the big peninsula. The fig
ures given ot Alaskan production show
the purchase of that land from Rus
sia was one of the most marvelously
lucky bargains ever made in the world's
history. The book is abundantly illus
trated. It is a good book for those who
love travel and description and for
those who wish to study Alaska's needs
and of how its conditions might in
some ways be improved by noting
what Canada does in neighboring and
similar regions.

NEW NOVEL FROM
PEN OF MRS. RICE
The popular author of "Mrs. Wiggs
of the Cabbage Patch" has given us
a new little sjptimistic novel called
"Sandy." and he Is a sort of incarnate
compelling smile. Perhaps this new
story will find more favor even than
the others in which Alice Hegan Rice
has previously given so much pleas
ure to readers. Sandy is a little Irish
boy who comes as a stowaway across
the Atlantic and after many experi
ences arrives at fast in Kentucky,
where Judge Hollis takes him into hia
home. He learned to love a little aris
tocrat while on the ocean voyage and
can't unlearn the lesson.
The boy, in addition to his won
derful friend-winning smile, had a
most dreamy and romantic imagina
tion. A scene which places him in
a boat, under the willows, with a girl
he loves is a pleasing piece of Mrs.
Rice's work. She says that the love
road had led the youth at last to the
real world of the King Arthur days,
"the world that was lighted by a
strange and wonderous light of ro
mance." These two had paddled their
boat uder the willows tc avoid the
heat of the sun. The youth is pictured
adoring his beloved. "Burning deeds
of prowess rioted in his brain. Any
danger was welcome from which he
might rescue her. Flood, fire or ban
dits. Meanwhile he sat in the prow of
the boat, his hands clasped about his
knees, utterly powerless to break the
spell of awkward silence that seemed
to possess him."'

THOMPSON SETON'S
BOOK OF FABLES
That famous teller of animal stories,
Ernest Thompson Seton, who for a long
time signed himself Ernest Seton
Thompson, has written a new book
called "Woodmyth and Fable." It is In
prose and verse, a little book, very
prettily illustrated and with every page
decorated. The designs for the cover,
title page and general make-up were
done by Grace Gallatin Seton, and they
are a great addition to the attractive
ness of the artistic volume.
The stories are all very short and
nearly all of them have a moral at
tached. One of these is the tale of a
land crab, who declared that nothing
could ever turn him one hair's breadth
from his purpose. He set out for the
sea, but during the winter a long line
of telegraph poles had been set up in
the track he was wont to travel. He
would not vary from his line, as he had
firmly determined. So up one side of
each pole and down the other he labor
ed till at last he was found dead with
fatigue. If he had varied six inches
from his set line he could have reached
his goal in half a day's easy travel. The
moial given is: "A good substitute for
wisdom has not yet been discovered."
These stories are a gathering from
various sources. Some of them ' are In
dian â legends and ' some, no doubt, - are
Mr. Seton's inventions. A very pretty
one of the Indian legends .is that ac
counting for /.he twin stars. They ara
the "yes v>f ("r ' liUle ,'ost ' maiden who
was. lifted up so her eyes can sparkle in
the skies.

NOTES OF BOOKS
AND THE AUTHORS
. The articles by Mr. Gilbert H. Gros
venor on '.'lnoculating th. Ground" and
"The New , Method of Purifying
Water," which have appeared In the
Century, have attracted wide attention
especially the first named, which ap
peals to the great audience of people
who are interested in the cultivation
of the soil. The announcement of. the
discovery of soil inoculation made In a
bulletin of the Department of Agri
culture two years ago (in an edition of
half, a million copies) did not be*in to
attract the attention of the press and
the public that was at.once centered on
the same subject when it was treated
in thÂ» Century Magazine. The number
of Inquiries received 'by the de
partment increased, on the publication
of the article in the Century, from 100
to 500 per day. and has since grown to
1000 per day The article has been
translated into many languages (in
cluding Chinese), and 'has been the
subject of editorial mention in papers
all over the globe.

It Feems that, in this country at

Henry Frow.de, who is tne head of the

dry that whereas from 1575 the yearly
sale of Bibles in general had risen from
half, a million to a million, his asso
ciation was now selling only one family

One of thp newest curiosities in
i Biblical, publications is an edition of
i the New Testament in Scotch dialeqt.

IX GIFTS OF CHARITY
Uly. Duchess of Marlborough, Be-
comes a Generous Patron of the
Churrh Army.
LONDON. April 29.â Lily. Duchess of
Ijjarlbornugh. has recently become a.
geiWous patron of the Church Army.
Until the King showed his aDDrecia
tion of ;he work of the society by in
viting its leader, the Rev. W. A. Car
lile. to Buckingham Palai-o, it had not
been numbered amrpÃ the charities to
which she contributed. Stimulated by
the royal example she is ( now makinsr
amends for her previous neglect. She
has visited several of its depots, ad
dressed cheering words to their in
mates and distributed among them a lot
of religious literature obtained from
Lady . Wimborne's bookshop. Her
checks, of course, she sends to head
quarters.
It is a striking illustration of the
value of the King's influence. But the
other American Marlboroujrh Duchess â
the reigning oneâ did not wait for that
incentive. Before the King had shown
any special interest in the work of the
Army she made a tour of its principal
London stations, accompanied by Mr.
Carlile. and wrote a letter to the Daper
that has the lar.gest circulation amoni
rich folk, deecribing what she had seen
and appealing to them to lend a help

PAYS FORTUNE
FOR A FLOWER
SoeclaJ Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, April 29. â Joseph Cham
berlain. If. P.. who is regarded as one
of the most enthusiastic orchid culti
vators in Europe, is likely to encounter
a serious rival in James Van Alen, the
expatriated American millionaire. The
extensive alterations made at Rushton
Hall, the historic mansion in North
amptonshire, which he has acquired,
have already been noted, but that he
intended to make a hobby of horticul
ture there in its most fascinating form
has heretofore been kept quiet.
Recently Van Alen visited High
bury, where he saw Chamberlains
famous collection of orchids. His
quick eye and retentive memory en
abled him to carry a diagram of
Chamberlain's scheme of cultivation
away with him. this he placed before
James Carmichael. his head gardener,
giving, at the same time, instructions
that neither pains nor money was to
be spared in the effort to equal and. if
possible, to surpass, the Highbury
display.
Carmichael, who was for many
years In the service of the late Queen
Victoria, has been scouring the coun
try for the rarest specimens of the or
chid family, and a few days ago suc
ceeded In obtaining what Is known as
a duplicate orchid. Three separate
specimens cost him close on $3000.
but Carmichael did not hesitate to out
bid all his competitors. There are
"duplicate" orchids in Chamberlain's
collection, but if Van Alen's flourish
at Rushton Hall they will excÂ»l, In
j rarity at least, anything to be found
in England.
For a number of years King Ed
ward has had to draw upon the re
sources of Highbury for his supply of
orchids. When foreign potentates visit
I the King and they are known to fa
vor this particular flower a special
messenger is dispatched to Highbury
and a supply obtained. Of course, it
will' be some time yet before Van
Alen will be able to produce in any
! large quantity, but he hopes soon to
be in a position to supplement Cham
berlain's efforts in obliging the Eng-
I lish monarch.

SHOOTING OF GUATEMALA'S PRESIDENT IS REPORTED
AEROPLANE SOARS DOWNWARD LIKE GRACEFUL BIRD
At a test at Santa Clara College yesterday it was demonstrated that the aeroplane invented by Professor J. J. Montgomery can
be successfully guided, and the Rev. Father R. H. Bell, S. J., of the chart- of physics- at the college, declares enthusiastically
that the demonstration is a great step forward in the science of navigation of the air.

Two Problems Left
for the Men of
Science.
The aeroplane invented by Professor
J. J. Montgomery. which, it Has said,
eolved one of the most difficult prob
jems of aerial 'navigation, and about
â which there has been so much talk,
was given a public test at Santa Clara
College yesterday "accordance with a
promise raade. Â« Though to the unscien
tific micd there did not. seem to be
much that was sensational in the. flight
of tixa machine.. the daring skill
of thÂ£ man who'-sat in the "saddle."
the inventor and the learned priests
at the college were full of enthusiasm
over â¬he result and saifl something of
great importance in the science of navi
gating- the t air had been accomplished.
> "The ; demonstration to-day was a
perfect success." said the Rev. Father
R. H. Bell, Â§. J., who, fills the chair of
physics at the college and has lent his
knowledge and skill toward the con
struction of the machine that is des
tined to create such a furor- in the
world cf science. * s As the machine was
being blest the Santa Clara before
its ascent we felt tftat one more glory
had been cast about that name. That
same dear college has given to the
world another proof of her greatness
and love of science." â¢ â¦
The word.Â«Â» cf" Father Bell, whose
standing as a scientist is the best, car
ry much weietit and his estimation
of the importance of the rssult gives it
great importance. Professor Montgom l
fry is equayy delighted, and Fays that
everything came out as desired â that
there was nothing* more that could be
in this torst stejv toward the ac
complishment of greater things and the
ultimate^ conquering **t the air.
BLESSI2S X \\oÂ» CRAFT.
The^ d*ay on* which wafs being cele
brated the birthday of the Rev. Father
Kenna, president of <he college, was
chosen for the test of the Montgomery
machine. There was 'quite a crowd
present, including Archbishop Mont
gomery, a cousin <Â»f the inventor. -
On the ground, besideÂ»a fifty-foot hot
air balloon, lay the plane, looking
like a captured wing creature of unu
sual shape. Waiting for the hour when
it was to show what it* could do when
set adrift in the sky. Shortly after 11
o'clock in the forenoon the great bag
that was tp efevate the aeroplane was
ready In star. More than a score of
men held it in lerfteh until the' final mo
ment should arrive. The man who was
to navigate the J&sser craft, Dan Ma
lone:: 142 pojinds weight, a professional
parachute came, # altired in
red tights, jauntily to the scene and.
with a lock that showed him to be light
of heart and entirely thoughtless of
any danger that might lie ahead,
straddled the pole beneath the wings at
a place where a small roll of carpet
material formed a very meager saddle.
He Inserted his feet in stirrups at
tached to the aeroDlane, grasped some
tiller wires . that looked very much
like reins and sat as if mounted on a
strange, winged monster waiting to
rise Into the sky.
In presence of the assembled throng
the Rev. Father Kenna blessed the odd
'nachine.o It w*s a pretty and novel
ceremony and 'will be carried in thÂ«Â»
memories <St those present. Ships of
the sea have been sent forth time with
out count with the blessings of pre
late, but perhaps never before a craft
of th" air.
It -vat- intended to leÂ£ the great gas
bag rise slowly with its burden for a
short distance that the aeroplane
might be properly adjusted as it rose
and that photographs might be taken.
An accident occurred, however,
thPt prevented this and showed
th^*" rr?rÂ«v clearly the remark
able points of the aeroplane San
ta Clara;, The rope with which the
balloon was to Â«be handled as it rose
from the ground broke and like a flash
of gunpowder almost the great . bag
shot into the air, Jerking Maloney and

maintained his upright pofftfcm, for
the bur on whUb be sat swings on
hinges and. BO matter how the sails or
wing* dip or turn hjs seat remains on
a level, as does the keel of a ship when
it heels. It looked fÂ»r one little second
as if the delicate craft might br; in
such a position that it could not be
cut loose", or if not this, that it would
not be in position to sustain its hu
man burden. It was only the specta
tors whe felt any a!arm.
Tlie snapping sound was caused by
the breaking â of the lop of a small
guy pole, which made no difference, it
was afterward learned. Maloney soared
up, some say 4000. others 2000 feet, and
then released himself. There was no
sudden drop, as in the cast of a para
chute, but for several seconds It looked
at if the mechanical bird was in doubt
whether it should descend or not. Ma
loney was, a.s usual, sitting with his
head pointing skyward, but the wings
of his vehicle were at an angle that
made it look as if they could not sus
tain weight. They did though. There
was no trouble about that at all, and
when the throng had made itself easy
on that point, it began watching Ma
loney, who by^this time was manipulat
ing his Btirrups and the tilltr wires
that he held in his hand.
lUDKS BOLDLY IN THE SKY.
The exhibition of jockeying in the
sky that followed brought many excla
mations of admiration from the spec
tators. The Santa Clara soared this
way and that and dipped and tacked.
The craft never rose, however. There
was little wind and the machine would
probably have been blown farther had
there been more, but it would also have
been enabled perhaps to perform even
more Interesting feats, as it is con
structed to toy with air currents. At
one time there was a shout that Ma
loney was coming back to land in the
inclosure from which he started, and
he certainly was moving toward the
college from the southerly point in
which the detached balloon had left
him. But he circled a few times, con
tinually moving earthward with the

gentleness of a feather and finally
landed in a grain field about half a
mile from where he had started. There
was no Jar when the machine again
reached terra flrma. It settled down
as if languorously seeking rest in the
waving oats.
There "was at once a ruth for the
place where the Santa Clara had light
ed, but the crowd met the man
who had so recently shot Into the air
on wing* coming down the road oh a
bicycle. He was given plenty of
cheers and men and boys followed him,
carrying the aeroplane, which had been
at once disunited into sections by him.
The machine was in no way injured.
From the time of the rising to the
settling of the Santa Clara was an
nounced to be seven minutes by some
one who had held a watch.
SU3IS UlÂ» THE RESULT.
Professor Montgomery was warmly
congratulated- by those assembled in
side the college grounds and he said
he knew that the result would be aatis- j
factory. He had employed Maloney a I
month before" he said, and has sent
him up four times previously to the
ascent just completed. Each timte the
inventor had learned a new point, he
said, and he was certain that the spec
tators would be astonished and that it
would be demonstrated that nothing
but the truth had been told about the
discovery.
Father Bell was also congratulated,
his devotion to the cause of the aero
plane and his scientific investigations
in regard to it having been great fac
tors in its successful flight. Father
Bell spoke as follows concerning the
accomplishment of the machine:
"The problem solved to-day by Pro
fessor Montgomery's aeroplane is the
balancing and successful directing of
such machines at \*ill with the wind
against it â in a word, a perfect naviga
tion of the air as far as the two fore
going points are concerned.
"People are likely to get an. exag
gerated notion in the matter, in so far
as to. expect a piece of mechanism
with a motive power residing in the

machine to overcome the downward ;
tendency of gravitation. This, of i
course, is yet to come. However, it '
must be understood that Professor j
Montgomery in offering to the world '<
the aeroplane, invented and planned by j
himself, has solved the first part of a '
very intricate and complicated problem '
and has practically demonstrated what j
no one has done heretofore â that an j
aeroplane built on thoroughly scientific
principles can be handled safely and:
directed in the air at any height.
"The demonstration, to-day was a j
perfect success and showed the most
skeptical that the story of the new
aeroplane was not merely hearsay.
When Maloney. by directing the
movements of the wings and sails, put
the machine at an angle of about 90
degrees to the earth and then in a j
graceful curve came circling about a i
second afterward, in the opposite di
rection, it was demonstrated that the
machine is built on thoroughly safe
principles.
"Time may go on without the reali
zation of our hopes, hut we do hope to
apply in the near future a motive
power to the machine that will sus
tain it. It must not, however, be
thought that even now the aeroplane
cannot be sustained in the air for a
considerable time. After repeated
trials, when the aeronaut gets a proper
mastery over the machine by taking
advantage of the winds, such a ma
chine can be sustained there for a very
long time. The enthusiasm of the in
telligent peopte that witnessed this
morning's trial demonstrated beyond
doubt what they thought of the in
vention. As the machine was being
blessed as the Santa Clara before its
ascent we felt that one mure glory
had been cast about that name. That
same dear college has given to the
world another proof of her greatness
and love of science."

Story Told by Cable

Is Killed.
News o! the Tragedy Is
Received bj Friends in
This City.
Adolf SUM, Intimate of the Central
American Ruler, Doubts the Au
thenticity of the Report .
The local colony of Central Ameri
cans was in a high state of excitement
last evening over a report receiv&i
here from the city of Guatemala to the
effect that President Estrada Cabrera
had been shot and his son, Gabriel,
killed. The news reached the city an
hour before the steamship San Jose,
bearing another son of the President,
Diego Estrada Cabrera, arrived in port
from the south. The message briefly
read as follows: .
"President and Gabriel shot. Gabriel
died."
As the. President of Guatemala has
a brother named Gabriel there were
some doubts expressed as to whether
he or the son had died, but a response
to a telegraphic query brought the in
formation that the son was the one re
ferred to in the message.
Among the first to whom the mes
sage, which was sen/ in a confidential
way, was conveyed was Adolf Stahl, a
member of the firm of Schwartz Bros.,
who do an extensive business In Guate
mala. Stahl arrived here on yester
day's steamer with young Estrada Ca
brera and was deeply interested in the
report, especially in view Â©f the fact
that the republic has lately been
threatened with an uprising. Late last
night, however, he gave out a state
ment through his wife that the report
circulated was without foundation, and
attributed its origin to some motive
unknown to himself. Young Estrada
Cabrera, who is staying at the Palace
Hotel, refused to discuss the matter.
A few years ago when President Â»
Barrios was assassinated in Guatemala
a similar brief dispatch reached the
Pacific Mail steamship management In
this city. For three days the report of
the President's death was stoutly de
nied by all the foreign representatives
of the little Central American republic,
including its Minister at Washlr -
and during that time a censorship pre
vented the outside world obtaining any
confirmation of the report. Finally an
official confirmation was sent out. with
a story of the n\urder. Recalling this
incident, the Central American colony
is naturally not satisfied with Stahi's
denial and is impatiently awaiting fur
ther advices from Guatemala, which
will be received to-day if the linaa 0
communication are open.

John R. Smith, the younger brother,
was also called. When fhey had fin

retired from Judge Lawlor's court,
where the jury was meeting, and took
no further part in their deliberations.
One of the bank officials who were J
questioned closely is P. K. Bowles, pres- j

McCabe Declares All Smith's Defalca
tions . Have - Been Uncovered.
The task of counting the coin in the
city treasury was resumed" yesterday
morning by the city officials and mem
bers of the Qf_n_ Jury. The, monpy
in the joint custody vault, amounting
to $.'.040,000, had been previously
found correct and the coin in the main
I vault, amounting to some $2,000,000,
I remains to be tallied. The sum of j
$660,000 was counted at the close of I
business hours and the work will be
concluded to-morrow.
The money s*o ft_r counted in the
bags \va* found intact, with the excep
tion of one sack, which contained a !
$20 gold piece too much. The bag ]
was one of v number brought from
the Western National Bank. It is ex
pected that some other bag will be
â¢T2O short, which will make up the
difference. When the money is all
counted a balance will be struck on
the books and the two amounts will
then be compared.

SMITHS COMMIT BATTERY.
Brothers Attr.ck a . Newspaper ' Pho
,, tographer and Are Arrested. â â¢
. James B. Smith and John R. Smith)
the brothers of the defaulting Tax Col
; lector, were arrested yesterday for as
; saulting George W. Haley, a newspaper
photographer. James B. Smith, -the
' grand juryman, was charged with bat
i tery and John jR. Smith had two
I charges of battery placed i against him
and also a charge of malicious mis
chief. ' V ' WS^BBBSBBm
Haley was attempting to photograph
the tw.> brothers as they were leaving
the Hall of Justice. He was taking a
snap shot of them when James Smith
cried, "Don't do that; we do not want
to be photographed."
"I've got to get your pleture," replied
Haley, and he pressed the button.
Both brothers started after him,
and Haley ran down Merchant street,
closely pursued by the two brothers.
The photographer darted into a drug
store on Montgomery street and at
tempted to throw his camera over the
counter.
John Smith seized the apparatus and
broke it with a punch. Haley declares
that in the struggle both brothers
struck him several times. The pho
tographer ehouted loudly for help and
Policemen Nelson and Stelzner re
sponded.
The Smiths were placed under arrest
and taken to the City Prison. When
John Smith saw that he was being
booked for battery he muttered some
thing to the effect that he had not
struck Haley.
"But I will make the charge good,"
he exclaimed, and he thereupon rushed
at Haley, whose head was turned in
another direction.
The brother of the defaulter swung
his fist heavily upon Haley's jaw and
1 sent him spinning to the floor.
Before he could strike another blow
the policeman caught him and pulled
him away. For this assault he was
booked on an ex/ra char.cc of battery.
Both brothers were released on bonis.
James B. Smith, the grand juror,
denies absolutely that either ho or his
brother struck Haley in the drug
"My brother broke the camera, " he
said. "I took no part in th. affair ex
cept that 1 held my brother back when
I thought that ho was gi Ing to hit
Haley. I told the man that we did not
want to be photographed. I have some
rights as a private citizen."
The Smiths are either or them bigger
end heavier than Haloy. John U., the
ens who struck him in the jail, in al
most twice his size and weight. The
photographer was badly bruised in the
encounter and his jaw i:s much swollen
where John Smith struck him.
Haley's friendft will press the charges
ptrongly against the Smiths. The pho
tographer asserts that both of the
brothers struck him viciously during
the struggle in the drus store.

diner, which was c torn to pieces. The
floor collapsed and the passengers
were picked up from the track. The
seven sleeping cars behind the diners
were left intact, but the shock sprung
many locks, imprisoning the occupants.
Seth Low and Mrs. Low, Dr. Mc-
Vicar and others were rescued when
the doors were smashed open with
axes. The passengers in the St. James
were quickly removed, but the three
negroes could not be saved. They
breathed the flames and died. When
he saw that the crash could not be
averted Engineer Hunter of the Ogden
train applied the emergency brakes
and jumped.
Practically all of the baggage, said
to be valued at $12,000, was destroyed.
It is claimed that a misunderstanding
of orders led to the accident.
SHIP RANGER WILL CARRY
AMMUNITION TO MANILA.
VALLEJO, April 29. â The U. S. S. j
Ranger, which has been lying at the |
Mare Island navy yard taking on |
stores and undergoing repairs, will j
sail for Manila within the next few '
days. The Ranger will carry ammu
nition to the fleet in Oriental waters, i
The Ranger's orders are to proceed
to Cavite for special duty and the fact
that she is an old ship and that all of
her guns have been removed leads to
the belief that she is to be turned over
to the Philippine Government for a
training ship for young Filipinos.
Surgeon. J. C. Fields, who relieves
Dr. F. J. B. Cordiero of the Lawton,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SUNDAY, APRIL 30, 1905.
SENSATIONAL
SUIT FILED
BY WOMAN
Wants Damages From Prom
inent Men She Says Stole
Love Letters Written to
Her by Senator T. C. Platt
DEFENDANTS SAID TO
BE CONSPIRATORS
Former Clerk in Washington
Avers She Is Victim of Plot
to Prevent Publication of
New Yorker's Silly Epistles
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, April 29. â Miss Mac C.
Wood, formerly a clerk in the Post
office Department at Washington,
caused a sensation in legal and politi
cal circles in Omaha to-day by filing
a suit for $35,000 against Robert J.
Wynne, Consul General in London;
William Loeb, secretary to President
Roosevelt, and J. Martin Miller, Con
sul to Aix la Chapelle. Miss Woods
alleged that the defendants conspired
and did obtain possession of a book
which she was compiling under {he
title, "The Love Letters of a Boss,"
which letters, she asserts, were written
her by a prominent member of the
United States Senate.
In the petition which Miss Wood pre
sented to the District Court she al
leges that Wynne, Loeb and Miller car
ried out the conspiracy complained of
between January 1 and October 12,
1903. She prepaid, she asserts, manu
script for publication under the title,
"The Love Letters of a Boss," largely
made up of letters received from Sena
tor Thomas C. Platt of New York, who
was 71 years old and "pretended to be
desperately in love with this plaintiff."
Miss Wood says she was engaged to
marry Senator Platt, but because of
his conduct the engagement was can
celled.
"For the purpose of trying to make
an independent living in a literary
field," the petition continues, "and as
compensation for the peculiar humilia
tions and persecutions she had been
subject to, she determined to utilize
such unfortunate and disagreeable ex
periences and publish said book con
taining verbatim paragraph after para-*
graph of the silly love expressions con
tained in the said letters which were
mixed with political animosities and
news. Said manuscript also being pre
pared with an actual account of the re
plies thereto as near as it wae pos
sible for this plaintiff to remember."
Miss Wood charges that the defend
ants, "learning of her intention to pub
lish her book, conspired with the au
thor of the letters, or with his political
enemies, to get possession of the manu
script and original letters by any pos
sible means for the purpose of holding
the same over the author, and possibly
to hold for ransom in addition, and
thus force said author to do or not do
certain things."
She alleges that J. Martin Miller, a
Washington newspaper correspondent,
was engaged by the conspirators to
represent himself as a publisher. He
thus obtained possession of the love
letters and manuscript and turned
them over to Abe Hummel, a New
York lawyer, who had been retained
by Frank H. Platt, the Senator's son.

AEROPLANE SOARS,
Continued From Page 25, Column 6.
has followed out the, principles of the
bird that flies and the ship that sails
the seas. The two wings are divided
in such a way that each has two parts.
There are special rotary movements in
the atmosphere and the surface of the
aeroplane's wings are formed and ad
justed relatively, so as to receive force
from these movements. There is a hor
izontal sail to give the machine up
ward and downward movement and a
vertical one to guide to either side.
The wings have a spread of twenty
four feet and are curved as are a bird's.
The pulling of wires throws the wings
into different positions, but they al
ways maintain that which keeps the
aeroplane floating gently in the air.
The curious new inhabitant of the
ether has a canvas tail that is manip
ulated in raising or lowering its front.
"There are three things to be at
tained in navigating the air," said
Professor Montgomery. "First, equili
brium and guidance; second, continu
ance in flight and. third, rising. We
have mastered the first, as shown to
day, and this is a great step. Never
before has there been built an aero
plane that a human being could safely
ride the air in and that could be
guided. In accomplishing that we have
gone a long way. The other steps will
come."
The problem that is left is largely
that of constructing an aeroplane that
can be guided and at the same time
is powerful enough to carry that which
will generate power and to also have
that which will lift itâ a gas bag.

SPANISH FRIAR'S SAD LIFE
LAID BARE BY A MURDER
Death Ends a Priest's Fight Against Fate
MADRID, April 29. â In real life it
is generally a sordid story that is laid
iÂ»aro by murder. But the murder of
a poor Spanish friar. Bibiano Gil, has
revealed a tale of blended pathos and
tragedy, of sorrow and heroism, of sin
unatoned and of a noble purpose frus
trated that reoaJls some of the most
moving romances of Victor Hugo. It
has furfcished Spain with something
more than a nine days' sensation. "His
Father's Sin" might well be the tUle
of this history, for its pathetic chap
ters and the terrible crime which
ends it \wÂ»re the fruits of a proud
man's Infamy. Ab usual it was the
innocent who suffered through It

! SPANISH PRIKST, THE PEASANT WHO
MURDERED HIM AND THE MOUN
TAIN HOMS OF BEIiOVED FRIAR.
Senor Antonio Gil y Laceta was a
personage much esteemed in Madrid.
He had the knack of making- money
and the still rarer one of keeping what
he made. He accumulated a large
fortune In the banking business and
doubled it by successful commercital
ventures. He took an active interest
in local politics, was a member of the
Common Council and ultimately rose
to be president of the municipal gov
ernment of Madrid. The King con
ferred on him the order of Charles II
and of Elizabeth the Catholic. A man
of austere habits, who lived frugally
and was seemingly entirely free from
the profligate vices of society, he was
reprrded as a fine type of the model
citizen.
All his life Senor Gil remained a
bachelor. In -Mb household was a
servant maid â Josephine Menendez â
who to the misfortune of poverty
added that of a pretty face. It is said
that Gil promised to marry her. To
escape a scandal, however, that might
have involvel awkward results for a
man who prided himbelf on his repu

priety he turned her out of the house.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 30, 1905.
He made no provision for her sup
port â he was opposed on principle to
investing money in anything that did
not promise a good profit â and the
poor girl hid her shame In a garret.
LEFT IX FOUNDLING ASYLUM.
Th-ire, in 1870, was born the man
whose tragic death and pitiful etory
has caused so profound a sensation
throughout Spain. The poor mother
wrote repeatedly to the child's father,
imploring him to take pity on their
babe and out of the abundance of his
wealth make some allowance that
would afford the little waif something
like a fair chance in life. To these
appeals Gil returned no answer. He
was concerned only that he should
run no risk of besmirching bis own
reputation.
Life went hard with poor Josephine.
Worn out by the struggle to support
herself and her infant, she was smit
ten with a fatal disease. When it be
came apparent that she had only a lit
tle longer to live, she left her child at
a foundling asylum, pinning to its
ragged dress a card on which she had
written: "This infant is named Bi
biano Gil and has been christened. He
is 18 nfonths old and has not been
acknowledged by his father." To the
one friend who had not abandoned
i her in her trouble â Mark Gonzales, an
old man â she confided the story of her
child's parentage and exacted from
Gonzales a promise that when the boy
had reached his fifteenth birthday he
would tell him the whole sad story.
Perhaps, she said, his father's heart
may be softened by that time and
he will do something for the lad. Then
she returned to her garret to die. But
holding by the simple faith the priests
had taught her that to obtain forgive
ness for her own sins she must first
j forgive all who had wronged her, she
sent Senor Gil a letter, telling him
that on her deathbed she had par
doned him.
He was presiding over a meeting of
the Common Council when the missive
was handed to him. He read it with
out changing color and tore it up and
proceeded with the affairs of the Coun
cil. It was a fine example of the self
sacrifice of the devoted official who
disdains' to permit his ' own private
cares and griefs to> interfere with the
transaction of public ,misineÂ«s(?)
Three days later Josephine died and
received a pauper's burial.
When little Bibiano was 5 years old
he was transferred from the foundling
institution to an orphan asylum. He
turned out an unusually tractable and
intelligent youngster and as- he grew
older manifested such a keen and de
vout interest in the spiritual teachings
of "his pious instructors that it was
decided to train him for the priest
hood.
DENTED BY FATHER.
True to bis pledge, old Mart Gon
zales looked â¢ the. boy up on his fif
teenth birthday, An<s told him all about
his parentage and the whole pitiful
story of his mother's betrayal and 'suf
fering. Apparently it only strength
ened Bibiano in his purpose to devote
himself to a religious life. He made
no attempt at the time to communi
cate with his father, but pursued his
theological studies with Increased zeal.
When 18 years o]r], released from
the seminary where he had completed
his, studiels, Bjbiano went to Madrid
and called on Senor Gil, to whom the
intervening years had brought great
increase in riches and of appreciation
for his distinguished civic virtues.
The banker received him with some
show of kindness: admitted that he
*yas his father: regretted that his posi
tion and reputation would not permit
him to openly acknowledge their re
lationship; commended his resolution
to become a religious ministrant, and
dismissed him as poor }n pocket as
when hg entered the house. He bad
wasted no money on the mother and
evidently he did not intend to waste
any on the son.
Accepting poverty as his lot, Bibiano
[Dined an <Â»rder of mendicant friars. He
traveled on foot through Spain, visiting
its most famous sanctuaries, and Jour
neyed far in foreign lands, obeying the
scriptural injunction with respect to
money, subsisting entirely on alms,
preaching the Gospel, ministering to
Lhe sick ami afflicted as tye oorp r
portunlty and sharing his food with
my bejrgar who might claim a por
tfcn. After a pilgrimage to the Holy
Land he went to Rome, having meap
ivhilf become a member of thÂ« Fran
:iscan order.
BJRI.WO'S AMBITION.
HI? piety, humility and unworldliness

lian of the celebrated shrine dedicated
o the Hoi;- Virgin Mary "Delia Quer
â¢ia" (of the oak tree), and there he. re
naired for s^ttac years. His heart
rearneu for z. father's affection, and he
said several visits to the Madrid bank
er, but the latter nersistently refused
o acknowledge him openly as *his son.
\.dvanKMnÂ£ age, however, appeared to
â xerrisp. some softening influence on
he stera old naÂ», and perhaps he felt
ptttbtfifiiftgÃ of remorse for his
treatment of poor Josephine.
A'h'n the young friar bade him fare
veil on the last of these visits Senor
jii kissed him' for the first time and
old him that in his .will he wouid
ecogni~Â§ him as his son and bequeath
Jim all his fortune; but while he liwd

It was paternal lova and not wealth
hat Bfbiano had sought, but the pros
tect of having .a large, fortune at his
lisposai filled him with joy, for it
vould enable him to realize an ambi
ion he had long cherished â the found
ng of an asylum for illegitimate and
breaken children. He returned to
taly and again became a wanderer. It
vas in March, 1904, when he chajiced

1 letter from a priest telling him that

sion in Madrid and were living in
sumptuous style. They refused to re
reive the friar and a liveried flunky
flammed the door in his face.
FIGHTING AGAINST WEALTH.
Without means though he was and
compelled to Jive a hand-to-mouth ex
istence on charity's doles, the friar's
unselfish purpose supplied him with a
stronger stimulus than most worldly
folk find in avarice alone. By dint of
courage ami persistency he overcame
all the legal obstacles that wealth
could muster against him and succeed
ed in starting a lawsuit to get posses
sion of the property.
While awaiting the trialâ and those
in possession were bent on making him
wait as long as possible â Bibiano re
ceived from the Bishop of Siguenza the
appointment of guardian of a hermit
age called La Cueva del Beato â the
Care of the Beatificd â a short distance
from the little town of Clfuentes.
The hermitage had been built in the
twelfth century as a retreat for pious
penitents, and attached to it was a
small house. The cave contained some
ancient altars and a very old reredos.
The country round about was wild and
rugged, abounding in precipitous j
gorges and deep chasms.
It was in December last that the
friar took up his abode in the desolate
old place. The grounds included an
orchard from which' he might obtain
seme sustenance in summer, but dur
ing the winter he was dependent en
tirely on the alms of visitors to the
ehrine. Frugal as were his habits,
theee did not suffice to supply his
needs, tinrt he had to make frequent
trips to the tewn to obtain food from j
the chajitable.
His kindliness, gentleness and humil
ity speedily made him a great favorite
among its humble inhabitants, and he
would have eked out a living and been
content with his lot but for the perse
cution of a shepherd, Vincent Olmo,
â who some years before had established
himself and his family in the house
attached to the hermitage. Olmo was
a burly, brutal sort of ruffian, of the
type from which the Spanish banditti
obtain their allies and recruits.
DRIVEN FROM HERMITAGE.
Before the coming of the friar he
had appropriated the gifts of visitors
to the shrine. That he might obtain
possession of them again, he set about
making life at the hermitage unendur
able to Bibiano. He mocked at his re
ligion, abused an insulted him and
then took to assaulting him. Finally,
in the hope that the brute might have
some sparks of feeling in him that
would be susceptible to pity, the poor
friar told him the sad story of bis life '
1 and what he aimed at accomplishing
to help others similarly unfortunate.
0 But Bibiano might as well have ap
pealed to a stone. Olmo treated him
worse than before. At last the friar's
limits of endurance were reached.
Black and blue from" the bruises he
had received, he fled afoot to Madrid
in the depths of winter. Half-fam
ished, he wandered for days about
the streets and at night sleut under
carts and on doorsteps. In his misery
and dire need he even appealed for
help to those who were reveling in
luxuries on his father's money â the j
money that had been promised him.
Agrain he was driven from their door. 1
AVOLF AND LAMB.
Bibiano saw no way of escaping ac
tual starvation if he remained in j
Madrid. So he wrote Olmo a letter j
telling the shepherd that he should !
have half the alms left by visitors If
he would permit him (Eibiano) to re
turn and live in peace at the" hermit
age. To this proposition Olmo made
a hypocritical reply, which was the
first step in a dastardly plot he had
formed. In his letter the shepherd ex
pressed penitence for his cruel treat
ment of the fria/ and implored him to
return, assuring him that he would
not be again molested. In the interim
Olmo had himself visited Madrid and
had called on the Gils. There are
many who attach a sinister significance 1
to this fact and connect it with the
terrible crime that followed.
Bibiano returned to the hermitage
the day after he received Olmo's let
ter â on February 20 la^t. Next day
he disappeared. Olmo said that on the
night of the 21st a stranger had called
to see the friar and he had ieft the
hermitage with him. Suspicions of
foul play got about, which were â 
strengthened by the discovery that the
shepherd was selling his flock and ;
making preparations to leave. Search
ing parties began to scour the neigh
borhood. Bloodstains were discovered
on some stones near the hermitage. |
Later it was noticed thnt from the i
mouth of an abandoned well there j
came an offensive odor. Then Olmo,
who loudly protested his innocence,
was arrested.
MURDER DISCOVERED.
A mason was lowered down the shaft j
at the end of a rope. He descended ;
over 120 feetâ the full length of the
rope â and still had not touched the |
bottom. But lodged in the crevices of
the rock he found some fragments of
letters addressed to Bibiano. A few
days later a windlass was rigged up
over the mouth of the shaft and the
mason made another descent. The Gov
ornor of the province, various judicial
authorities and a large crowd were
present. Nearly 200 feet the mason
went down, and when he was hauled
up he carried a ghastly burden â thÂ«
body of the poor friar. That he had
been murdered was made plain at the
inquest. His skujl had been smashed
by some blunt instrument. â¢
Olmo confessed after this. On some
pretext he had lured Bibiano to the
belfry of the hermitage church and
while his back was turned had struck
him on the head with a crowbar.
Then he had thrown the body down
the shaft.
The intervention of armed ?Â«Â»nJarmes
alone prevented Olmo from being
lynched on the spot. That he will be
executed is certain. Regarding his
fate v however, little concern is felt. The
question thnt profoundly interests all
Spain is whether the Gil 3 were accom
plices in his murder. It is pointed out
that the shepherd having got rid of the
friar had â if he acted alone â no motive
for getting him back to the hermitage.
On the other hand, as- Bibiano was
pressing a lawsuit to take the banker's
property from them the (Tile certainly
had a motive for desiring his removal.

A good story is told of the way
Pension Commissioner Vesperian War
ner made the discovery of "passed
papers" in the pension office that re
sulted in the forced resignation of a
Corps of pension examiners and a
greate t deal of scandal over pending
pension applications.
Commissioner Warner noticed soon
after c taking charge of the office that
a very loose system had been in vogue
â¢â whereby certain examiners who had
been years in the service had been al
b lowed to pass "On pension papers after
which pensions were allowed without
lurther question by the 5 heads, of the

* OnÂ£ day a bunch of pension papers

according to custom, and instead of
pigning them and handing them back
without further ado he said to the ex
aminer. "Leave t them here awhile. I
want to look at th^m"
An hour Jater Warner glanced
through the papers and the second
one in the bunch was that of "Pri

Â» Warner js an old soldier himself
and he happened to know something
about Pennsylvania troops, "Mc-

"Do you know anything about these

"Yes,, sir, they have, been . passed

"Glad to" hear that." said Warner
*vjth a tone of sarcasm. "I know Me-:

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. APRTL 30. 1905.
DISCOVERS RICH
ORE IN IDAHO
DENVER, Colo., AdHI 29.â G01d dis
coveries near the headwaters of the
Salmon River, in Idaho, it is reported,
presage the opening of a new mining
district which may rival any heretofore
discovered. Specimens of extremely
rich ore said to have been found in this
'region have been brought to this city
by T. M. Howell, a former Denver
newspaper man, one of the pioneers of
the Cripple Creek district and a well
known prospector. One piece oi float
sawed in twain revealed v streak of al
most pure gold half an inch thick
which assayed at the rate of 36 io
ounces a ton. The ore Is a rusty sugar
quartz mixed with Iron, that looks
more like coal cinders than phenom
enally rich rock.
Howell said that the ore was found
near Yellow Jacket Creeek, one of the
tributaries of the Salmon River, along
which many millions of dollars' worth
of placer gold have been found. The
district is 125 miles from the nearest
railroad station, Red Rock, Mont., and
near the trail over which hundreds of
prospectors massed a few years ago in
a mad rush to the Thunder Mountain
country, which Is about forty miles
farther west.
''I believe," said Howell, "that the
find which J have made goes a long
way to solving the problem of the
source of the placer gold of the Idaho
streams. Idaho has produced more
than $200,000,000 of placer gold, yet there
has been comparatively little gold
quartz mining in that v country. This
ore 13 remarkably free milling. The
climatic conditions of the district are
remarkably favorable."
FACING SIEGE
OF MANY DAYS
RATON", N. M., April 20. â After suc
cessive delays of sixty hours at Gallup
and almost as much at Las Vegas, the
thousand or more passengers on the
Santa Fe trains from the coast are
facjjig an indefinite continuance of the
blockade. The break at Maxwell City
was successfully repaired to-day and
trains began leaving Las Vegas at 8
a. m. On arriving at Raton !t waa
learned the track for nearly five miles
between Morley and Starkville had
been washed away. At one r>lace two
miles east of Morley a high embank
ment has been washed away, leaving
only the rails hanging above the place
where the fill had been. It is said it
will require from three to five days to
repair this break alone.
The three California Limited trains,
which have formed the vanguard of
the dozen or more trains from the
coast, were sent East from here this
afternoon and efforts will be made to
transfer the passengers over the wash
outs between Morley and Starkville.
At the latter place it will fee possible
to take the electric can to Trinidad, m
distance of five miles.
A landslide occurred in the Raton
tunnel, nine miles east of here, to
day, but has been repaired sufficiently
to allow the passage of the three Unit
ed trains. The discouraged paânngerw
are laying in a store of provisions to
last several days.
Valise Tnirf Is Charged.
Edward C. Franklin was booked at
the City Prison yesterday by Detec
tive Egan on two charges of petty
larceny. He was arrested on Thurs
day while in the act of stealing a va
lise at the ferry. He is accused of

TITLED BRITONS
TAKING SHARES
Fcsclal DUpatcli to The CÂ»ll.
[4QNDOK, April 29.â Americans are
organizing a wireless telegraph com
pany in London. According to exclu
sive information to The Call, the new
company will have Lord Armstrong,
the head of a big shipbuilding firm
here, hs its leading director, although
Lord Brassey'a name is more or less
connected with the cnterpris*-.
The announcement of the formation
of the new company, soon to be is
sued, will state that the undertaking
has been underwritten. The name of
the company is to be the De Forest
Wireless Telegraph Company, Limited,
and it will hove .a capitalization of
$600,000 in $5 shares, all in one class
of stock. The company Is to acquire
the rights of the American de Forest
Wireless Telegraph Company for Eng
land, her colonies and the Continent of
Europe, for which the American com
pany is to receive from 25 to 33 per
cent in stock of the English company
and a cash consideration.
Among the directors, it is believed,
will he two cable directors, besides
Lord Armstrong and other English in
vestors of prominence who will com
plete the board, with the exception of
one American, who will represent the
holdings of the parent company. This
gentleman will probably be Frank Z.
Maguire, who Is the chief representa
tive in England of Edison's cinemato
graph enterpriser, known here as the
bioscope, which practically controls
this business in Great Britain. Ma
guire has just gone to New York to
complete the details of the wireless
telegraph transfer of rights. He Is
expected to return about May 1, when
the formation of the English Company
is expected to be made known.
A favorable rer>ort has been made
by the Postal Telegraph Department
of the British Government upon this
system a-? the result of experiments
between England and Ireland. It will
be remembered also that the London
Times used this service in the present
war until stopped by the combined ac
tion of the Japanese and the Russians.
It 's said here that none of the shares
of the EnsliKh company are to be of
fered to the public.
KEITH TO OPEN
ENGLISH HOUSE
Spfflal Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, April 29.-B. F. Keith has
decided to open the Princess Theater,
Oxford street, as a continuous perform
ance houst- as soon as the necessary al
terations can he made under the direc
tion of the London County Council. His
Londoh representative, H. H. Feiber,
has advised his assistants here that he
will return to London on May 8 when
there is likely to be some official an
nouncement.
The Princess Theater was purchased
sonic time ago by Keith for approxi
mately $375,000 upon an option held by
R. O. Knowles, the American come
dian. After Keith assumed ownership,
the house was rented and 'The Fatal
Wedding" played for about a year,
when the London County Council or
dered the theater closed because there
was no asbestos curtain. The subse
quent application of Keith to reopen
the theater resulted in a refusal by the
authoritiea unless what were consid
ered almost impossible alterations were
made. Since then negotiations have re
sulted in a tentative agreement where
by a new inspection was made by the
prc-per officials last week and the mat-*
ter is now in the hands of the London
County Council, which body, if is stat
ed, will report favorably to the Lord
Chamberlain, who, in this particular
case, has the sole authority to license
the theater.
Both the American actresses who are
now members of Sir Henry Irving's
company will appear in his revival of
"Becket" at the Drury f Lane next
month. Maude Fealy will play the part
of Rosamund de Clifford, and Mrs.
CHICAGO STRIKE LEADERS
INDICTED BY GRAND JURY
Conspiracy Is the
Charge Against
Union Men.
Vicious Rioting on
the Lake City's
Streets.
CHICAGO, April 29.â Twelve of thÂ«
labor leaders prominently identified
with the teamsters' strike were in
dicted by the Grand Jury to-night.
This was the last day of^the session
of the jury and the indictments were
returned to Judge McEwen just before
the Jury adjourned. Each Indictment
contains six counts and charges the
men with conspiracy-
The indictments were based solely on
the evidence given during the last
week by witnesses who testified spe
cifically as to the troubles of the labor
unions and Montgomery Ward & Co.
The Investigation was of a general
character and evidence was heard on
all phases of the strike, including that
which related to conferences between
the leaders of the unions interested and
not interested in the strike, specific
acts of the same leaders in these con
ferences and the conversations with
employers.
The most important and detailed
evidence on which the voting of the
indictments was based came from
I Frederick Job, secretary of the Em
j plovers' Association, and from Robert
jJ. Thorne, manager for Montgomery
Ward & Co. and a stockholder in the
coal firm of Daniels & Co.
GKAND JURY'S ACCUSATIONS.
One count in the indictment charges
1 the defendants with conspiring to pre-
I vent all persons not members of the
j Teamsters' Vnion from securing em
, ployment as drivers. This is described
lin the count as being contrary to
] "police moral?." Another count
I charges conspiracy to prevent any
I union teamster from picking up or de
llvering any goods from Montgomery
Ward & Co, This is declared to be a
j violation of "trade morals." A third
count charges conspiracy to di* an il
; legal act. in that the t^an.sters were
warned not to do any work for Moni
: gomery Ward & Co. The fourth
1 charges that the conspirators com-
I pelled the proprietor of th^ Windsor-
Clifton HoteJ to put out certain guosts
'â  of the hotel because they were em
ployes of Montgomery Ward & Co.
Tho strike continued to spread tc
1 day and a large number of teamsters
; employed by lumbermen, grocers arid
' various coal companies went out. The
most serious phase was the aggressive
ness of the packers, ice dealers and
commission men. who have decided
ithat they will stand with the members
!of the Employers' Association and de
: mand that their teamsters make deliv
â¢ cries. It was decided by the packers.
Ice dealers and co-mmission men that
they would issue orders for deliveries
!to boycotted firms and that if any
i teamster declined to make them he
was to be instantly discharged. This
means a lockout, fnr the men have
already declared that they will not
' make such deliveries.
There is a strong sentiment among
the labor men to have President Rooee
RAKE DICKENS' KDITION
OWNED BY W. VV. ASTOR
Gold on the Volumes Said to Be-
Worth Fifteen Hundred
Dollars.
LONDON April 29.â William Wal
â  dorf Astor, accompanied by his son-in
law. Captain Spender Clay has been >
taking quiet runs on his luxuriously ,
equipped motor car recently into ob
â cure little country villages on the bor- â¢
; der3 of London. A few days ago they
were seen traveling at a moderate
pace along by Epping Forest and later
on they appeared at Chigwell, where
they lunched at the famous old inn ;
Hrnmortalized by Dickens.
Though his own literary style con
veys no suggestion of it, Astor is an
ardi-nt Dickensonian and anything
with which the name of the great
master is identified he is interested in.
It is said that he has an edition of
Dickens so richly bound that many
thousands of dollars could not buy it.
He has a special man in from the well
known firm of W. H. Smith & Son to
look after his library at regulated
times and no binder but this man is
allowed to touch the Dickens edition.
He has other editions for the use
of h!s friends and even the servants
are allowed the free use of them when
they feel they have time to read. It Is
estimated that the gold alone on the
richly bound volumes must have cost
$15OU.

ador," made by Templo Thurston from J
his wife's novel, will be George Alex- '
andcr's next production at the St. '
James. The play will be called, as th-
novel is ver here. 'John Chilcote, M. |
P." For stage purposes Thjrston has ;
completely altered the onginal story. ''
The end of "The Masquerader" left no j
one satisfied. But why not teil the ;
truth*? This is what is done in the !
play; the whole world is informed of
the deception that has taken place, j
The main situation is made more !
plausible, too, by talk in the early j
scenes of a recent case â described as 1
the "Peck case" â in which ono man '
has been imprisoned in mistake for an- J
other. In the play, too, Loder and '
chilcote have met before thÂ« action j
begins.
A. M. Schreyr r. known in the United j
States as "Daredevil Schreyer," diving i
aerial cyclist, is in London trying to j
convince the London County Council j
that his act is not dangerous. High I
cycle diving has never been seen In !
Great Britain and Schreyer does nÂ»>t |
lack engagements, but upon seeking j
permission to commence his tour in '
London the authorities denied it. He i
will probably go into the provinces, j
where there is r\6 embargo on thfs sort !
of spectacle, without the advantage of
a London appearance.

This Is a type of social affair that
leavens society, the hosts and guests
holding an interest in vital things and
interest in each other â the beneficent
results of trained minds and trained
hearts.
And, contrary to popular opinion,
trained minds and trained hearts can
abide â with beautyâ and do.
If you entertain thoughts to the con
trary peek in at the next reunion of
the Collegiate Alumnae.

JUANA MARSHALL'S ESTATE
IS COVETED BY ALVA UDELL
One final effort will be made to
wrest the estate of aged Juana Mar
shall, whose story of an attempt to,
poison her recently occupied the at
tention of the police, from the hands
of the Union Trust Company, which
was appointed guardian of the old
woman's estate a few weeks ago by
Judge Kerrigan on the ground that
she is mentally incompetent to care for
the same. With the object in view
of gaining possession of the estate,
Alva Udell, personally and as alleged
trustee of Mrs. Marshall's estate, filed
suit yesterday against the Union Trust
Company, various banks in which her
money is deposited, George D. Toy
and Bovee, Toy &. Co. to recover pos
session of the estate and for $2000
damages for the alleged unlawful
withholding of the came.
Plaintiff alleges that on April 25 last
Mrs. Marshall conveyed in trust to him
and William J. Gray her entire estate,
to manage the same and pay her the.
income during her lifetime. What dis
position was to be made of the estate
after the death of Mrs. Marshall is
not set forth. In local banks, says
Udell in conclusion, is $12,000 and se
curities of a value of $20,000. The
immediate delivery of these he de
mands, together with a transfer of all
the aged woman's realty. â¢
Udell is his own attorney ana sues
alone, his alleged fellow trustee, Gray,
not being joined.

GET-RICH-QUICK CONCERN
IS ATTACHED FOR DEBT
Manager Is Too Slow In Paying? For-
mer Stockholder Who Is Eager
to Secure Money.
The San Francisco and Los Angeles
offices of the Cumulative Credit Com
pany, a get-rich-quick concern, were
attached yesterday on complaint of M.
E. Johnson, a former stockholder, who
alleges that $6500 is due him on a
note. The attachment was made
through the Becker Law and Collec
tion Agency by its attorney, Stacey
Gibbs.
The concern has handsome offices in
the Callaghan building and is presided
over by Orlando Fitzsimmons. The
latter says he bought. Johnson's stock
in the company a year ago. He al
leges he paid him all but $6500 and
at the present time is unable to meet
the latter obligation. He says he
agreed to settle with Johnson as soon
as he could ralsa the money, but John
son was Impatient and refused to wait,
hence the suit.
Fitzsimmons declares the company
will still continue to do business and
will not be Impaired by the suit, as the
attachment Is made for his personal
debt. The company was recently In
trouble and the postal authorities de
barred It from using the malls on the
ground that it had violated the postal
laws.
No prayer is lifted on Â«tilted
phrases.

CONFIDENCE GAME PLAYED
UPON DRUG CLERK COFFEY
Buys Cloth From Man and Confeder
ate Gets It Back by Representing
He Is Detective.
The police were notified yesterday
of a clever confidence game that was
played upon Ernest H. Coffey, clerk
In a drug store at Market street and-
Van Ness avenue, on Wednesday
night. A man called at the store with
four pieces of cloth, each containing
three yards. He offered to sell them
cheap and Coffey bought them for
$20.
The following evening a man called
and asked Coffey if he purchased some
cloth the previous night. Coffey re
plied in the affirmative and the man
said: "Well, I'm Detective Tom Ryan.
That cloth was stolen and the thief Is
under arrest. I want the cloth as evi
dence." Coffey handed over the
cloth and the man left.
Another clerk named Atwood saw
the man leaving with the cloth and he
asked Coffey what was the matter.
Coffey told him and Atwood said: "I
know Detective Ryan. That man Isn't
Ryan." Coffey ran after the man and
overtook him at Tenth street. Coffey
â¡ sked to see his star and the man
showed him some sort of a badge,
which satisfied Coffey. The man was
a confederate of the aeller of the
cloth.
The best way to pity a "man Is to
pick him ud. '

CHRISTIAN EXDEAVORBRS
GATHER AT ST. HELENA
Delegates From the Xapa and Sonoma
County Societies Attend the
' Annual Convention.
* NAPA* April 29.â The annual con
vention of Christian Endeavor socie
ties of ICapa and Sonoma counties was
opened last night at St. Helena. The
opening praise service was conducted
by Dr. G. S. Conner of St. Helena-

Wilson's Memory Is Hazy.
The poKce were notified on Friday
that Thomas H. Wilson, hardware
merchant at 324 Sixth street, com
plained that he had -been robbed of
8S and ten pocket knives after being
knocked down. Policeman T. P. Rlor
dan made an investigation and report
ed that Wilson had been drinking
heavily for some days and had evi
dently fallen in his honie and injured
his face. Riordan was skeptical as to
any money having been taken from
Wilson. He told Riordan he had no
recollection of anything having hap
pened to hlrn.
It takes a mighty rood stage witti
cism to stand the test of the morning
after.

VETOES EXPANSION BILL
Refuses to Sign Measure That Caused
Bitter Fight Between Two Factions!

DENVER, Colo., April 28.â Governor
Jesse McDonald to-day 0 vetoed the
railroad merger or expansion bill
passed at the late session of the Leg
islature, the purpose of which, as rep
resented, was to enable the Colorado
and Southern Railway . Company to
extend its lines to the Gulf of Mex
ico and in other directions. There
has been a bitt#r fight over this meas
ure between two factions of the Re

Smoking Displeased Her.
Jessie Louise Shawhan has sued
William D. Shawhan for divorce, al
leging cruelty. Mrs. Shawhan alleges
that while she was ill in their apart
ment at the Hotel Paisley her hus
band kept the lights burning until
midnight and filled the room so full
of tobacco smoke that breathing was
difficult. This caused her untold suf
fering, she alleges, and should entitle
her to a decree. Helma Thron has
sued Louis Thron for annulment of
their marriage. Mrs. Thron cenfesses
that when she married Thron on May
26, 1904, she had another husband liv
ing. Mrt. Thron's attorney explained
that she was married within a year
after obtaining a divorce from her first
husband, and, believing that in I.t\v
she is yeUwedded to her first husband,
she wants her second marriase an
nulled that she may enter a final de
cree against her first husband. Then,
it is explained, she will b,e remarried

I hasl?n.ed to the plafce of performance;
i but ef<?.he reached the spot the"tlance
i wis reduced to v pas seul by the -flight
;of one of (fhf;- 'participant's. T.he ona
i who remained was Patrick Mahoney,
and he never ceased cutting pigeon
wines until the restraining hand of
the f>aptaln was upon his shoulder. He
â  was booked for petty larceny, although
his condition would have justified, an
additional charge of drunkenness. In
his possession when taken in was a
bottle half full of wine, which, with
ten others, hart been purloined from a
case consigned to the City of Peking
for transportation lo the Orient.
In the Â£ourt of Police Judge Mogan
lit was stated that Patrick Mahoney
and a number of fellow stevedores were
loading the bis liner when the vintage
fell into their hands. They concealed
and broached it and lightened their
toil by tippling until discretion desert
ed them and the'r inebriety became
apparent to the foreman, who searched
the ship until he discovered the plun
' rler, when he sent a hurry call to the
Harbor station. By that ttme Patrick
Mahonoy and one of his comrades had
become so Intoxicated that they ceased
i work entirely and took to dancing.
Each of them had a bottle in hand
as he danced, and Mr. Mahoney's voice
was raised in Bacchanalian song, wjiile
his feet nimbly flew.
At the request of the prosecution a
' continuance <>f the case till May 5 was
' ordered, it being understood that war
rants were out for the arrest of sev
eral other parties to the illicit revel.

the trio abruptly and mysteriously dis
.appeared from the balcony, and since
that hour Mr. Arata has neither 'seen

merged ' gold a myth, so a few days

â¢
NEW' YORK, April 29.â A decision
for the plaintiff has been rendered by
Justice Vernon M. M. Davis of the Su
preme Court in a peculiar 1 suit brought
by Congressman W. R. Hearst against
his colleague in the House of Repre-
sentatives, Charles A. Towne. Both
;nen reDresent New York districts.
The action was brought by Hearst
to recover $6000 loaned the defendant
on a promissory note in February. 1904.
The complaint sets forth that payment
orr the note was refused. The defense
put in by Congressman Towne is that
Hearst lent the money with the under
standing that the borrower should
.write various articles for a publication
owned by Hearst in Washington. The
defendant declared he was not asked
to write these articles, although ho was
ready to perform the services as
agreed. Justice Davis in awarding
Judgment against Towne says:
"The allegations of the complaint aip
substantially admitted by the answer,
and there are no allegations of new
matter that amount to a defense. Un
der the circumstances the plaintiff is
entitled to judgment."
her to bitter -wailing and overladen
horses hardly ever failed to plunge her
Into grief most profound.
"What were you crying for when
the policeman arrested you?" the
Judge asked her.
"I couldn't help thinking of the pain
1 once suffered when my arm was
broken," she replied.
"And you had nothing more dis
tressing than that on your mind?"
"Wasn't that enough?" she whim
pered.
"I hope that fifteen days in prison
will fortify your emotions," was the
final pronouncement.
Mrs. Lizzie Lindauer averred that
she did not slap the face of Mrs. Mar
garet Hughes, who dwells at 100
Lundy lane, until that lady had
called her "this, that and the other
thing," also "everything she could lay
her tongue to," not to mention the ad
ditional provocation afforded by the
malicious drenching of the Lindauer
child with water from a hose held by
Mrs. Hughes. "Indeed," said Mrs.
Lindauer to Judge Cabaniss, "I won
der how I stood that woman as long as
I did."
Mrs. Hughes declared that she did
not think of getting Mrs. Lindauer ar
rested until she was challenged so to
do by the defiant utterance of these
words: "Now, you church-going hypo
crite, there's a new cop on the beat,
and I suppose you'll try to get me
pinched, as you did before." The face
slaplng was adding injury to the afore
quoted insult.
"To effect a truce in this second bat
tle of Lundy lane," said the Judge "I
will continue the case one month, al
lowing Mrs. Lindauer to go free on
her own recognizance, and hoping that
both Mrs. Hughes and Mrs. Lindauer
will respect the armistice."

DANTEI. OHLEABY. A YOUNO
IRISHMAN WHO DISAPPEAR
b ED MYSTERIOUSLY LAST SUN
?Â« DAT NIGHT.
The friends of Daniel O'Leary. a
young Irishman, have grave fears that
he has been shanghaied or has met
with a serious accident. He left his
home in West Oakland last Sunday
night with his cousin. Daniel Horgan. ;
The oair separated in this city and
f lnce that time nothing has been heard i
of CLeary.
The missing man and his cousin
started out to see the sights. Horgan
had about $50 in his pockets, while
O*Xieary's "O-ealth was about $10. The
men were drinking together for several
hours and 'at 'a late hour Horgan re
turned to Oakland without his rela
tive. â¢' ; :\,v.
O'Leary arrived from Ireland a short
time ago and was unused to the ways
of a large city, and for that reason his
friends fear for his safety. He was
about; 5, feet 10 inches in height,
weighed 170 pounds and was attired in
a dark, suit "of clothes. O'Leary was
employed -by the Southern Pacific and
was a member of Oakland Division No.

WANT PARTY NAMES PLACED
OX THK PRIMARY BALLOTS
Democrats and Republicans of Stock
ton File Petitions tn the
Supreme Court.
The outcome of the bitter party
tight that is being waged in Stockton
over the placing of party candidates
on the ballots was in a measure trans
ferred to the Supreme Court yester
day, when F. E. El!is, representing the
combined Republican and Democratic
parties, filed three petitions for writs
against City Clerk George S. Wheat
ley.
Two of the writs sought are of man
date, directing the City Clerk, who is
a candidate on the Civic League ticket,
to place the names of Republican and
Democratic candidates on the ballots,
while the other is a writ of prohibi-.
tion restraining the Clerk from plac
ing the names of Civic League candi
date* on the ballots. All parties ate
anxiously awaiting the Supreme
Court's decision* many messages of in
quiry from Stockton being : received
yesterday.
The whole affair is the outcome' of
thÂ» neglect by Republicans and Demo
crats to file their primary election calls
the proper time. Five days elapsed
before the error was discovered" and
then both parties agreed that neither
would attempt to take advantage' of
the lapse. At the* last moment the
Civic League, claiming to be formed
in the Interests of good government,
filed the necessary petition and nomi
nated its ticket. The City Clerk Is
a candidate on the Civic League ticket
for re-election and he will not allow
the names of either of the other party
â candidates to appear on the ballots.
St. Peter's Pariah Picnic.
The annual picnic of St. Peter's par
ish, of which Rev. P. S. Casey is pas
tor, will be held this year on Thurs
day, May 11, at Camp Taylor. The
committee having charge of the Ar
rangements for the picnic is making
strenuous efforts to have this outing
the most successful ever given by the

DRAG SAILORS
THROUGH SURF
The schooner Mary S. Russ, Captain
Everson in command, which was
Avrerked on April 13 on the Mexican
coast, about sixty miles. north of Man
zanillo, was driver, ashore during a
heÃvy northwester. A terrible surf
was running, and through this all
hands â seven men ajid the skipper â
were dragged to dry land and safety
by half a hundred natives. The seven
men arrived here yesterday on the
liner San Jose. Captain Everson Is
still with his wrecked vessel, arrang
ing for the disposition of her remains.
The Russ was lying off shore loading
hardwood logs when the storm came.
The velocity of the wind increased
with great rapidity, and high seas soon
were sweeping the schooner toward
the beaoh. There was no pos
sibility of beating out to the open sea.
ThiW anchors were. out. but there was
no holding the schooner against â  the
combination of. wind and wave, and
by leaps and bounds she was hurled
beachward. About dusk she struck
bottom arid began pounding furiously.
Fortunately for those on the Russ na
tirea had noticed .thie vessel's 1 plight,
and, fifty scr.ong; they -gathered at the
edge of the breakers, watching for a
chance to hel'r. -The schooner began
to go to pieces.. Captain Everson. acted
promptly.
A billat of wood tied to a light line
was thrown overboard and within â¢ a
few minutes was carried within- reach
of the men ashore. A heavier line was
bent on, and hempen communication
was established with the beach. On
the shore was nothing to which the
line could be made fast, so the natives
had to hold it. which proved no easy
task, as the schooner, on the other
end of the line, was dancing in the
breakers like an intoxicated Taqui
Indian. An end of the light line, which
had been retained on board, was now
made fast to a pulley rigged over the
heavier rope, and, in the bight of a
line made fast to the pulley, one by
one the men that had manned the
Mary E. Russ were dragged through
the breakers. Pome were unconscious
when strong arms pulled them out of
the roaring sea, all were more or less
battered, but none of them sustained
any serious hurt. Captain Everson
was the last to leave the wreck.
The shipwrecked sailors were cared
for by the natives and later were sent
to Manzanillo In a fishing boat. At
Manzanillo they were taken in charge
by the United States Consul, who ship
ped them home on the San Joae.
Officers and men, the shipwrecked
tars all speak highly of Captain Ever
son's conduct in the hour of stress. For
the vessel's going ashore, they say, do
blame attaches to the skipper, who
took all possible precautions for the
safety of his charge. Captain Everson
is a son of Wallace Everson, president
of the Pacific Coast Surety Company.
The Mary E- Russ was a vessel of
223 tons register, and was owned In this
city.

METHOD OF tX3RECASTIXG -|-
TO BE CHANGED TO-MOIUXOW
The local branch of the Weather
Bureau has received instructions from
Chief Moore at Washington to begin
May 1 with the new designations of
localities in California in the making
of forecasts. The change is the sub
stitution of the various sections, val
ley, mountain, bay. foothills and coast,
for the former subdivisions. Northern
and Southern California.
Prof^sor McAdie of the Weather
Bureau said yesterday that In this
State only is such a designation used
and thus the forecasts of California
vill have a unique appearance on the.
records of the Weather Bureau. The
anticipated change will not cause the
reports from various parts* of the State
â¢r the official maps to be changed, but
hereafter such reports sent out in
â¢ast only will receive topographi
cal designation.
The forecasts will be unique from
the additional fact that they will be
th*Â» first in which no latitudes are
designated. The forecaster Is also
g-iven an oportunlty to take advantage
r>t xny change in the special areas and
alter the forecasts accordingly.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. APRIL SO, 1905
EARL OF WEMYSS
A REMARKABLE MAN
Though Almost Nono
genarian He Is
Most Active.
Speeches in House
of Lords Still
Fiery. \
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, April 29.â One of the most
remarkable men in the House of Lords
is the venerable Earl of Wemyss, who
caused no little amusement the other
day by sitting down on his own silk
tile at the conclusion of a fiery speech
on the evils of Sunday trading. It re
called a more sensational performance
in the same line when the Earl
crushed another hat, a hat that did not
belong to him, and thereby acquired
the distinction of being the only man
who had ever struck his sovereign.
It occurred during a debate in the
House of Lords when Oie Earl was
making a vehement harangue in favor
erf a militia ballot. The King, then the
Prince of Wales, chanced to be occupy
ing a seat in front of him. Emphasiz
in? one of his points with a magnificent
gesture, the zealous peer brought his
clenched fist down hard on the royal
hat, bonneting his future ruler most
effectively. It was characie'iÃtic of the
Earl that he did not allow the unto
ward incident to disturb the thread of
his discourse, postponing his apologies
to a more convenient season. But his
Royal Highness displayed great agil
ity in getting out of range.
A PROPHET OF EVIL.

RAND'S METHOD
AMUSES "NAN"
NEW YO"RK, April 29.â-"Nan" Pat
terson received a number of newspaper
men in the prison to-day and talked
with them freely regarding her case.
During the talk she sat beside her
sister, just outside the door of their
cell. . \
"I am not at" all afraid of anything
Midget has said on the: stand." she :
said, as she placed her hand on her
sister's arm. "To me Mr. Rand's ac
tion was more amusing than .serious,
knowing as I do now that he offered
Midget her freedom if she would tes
tify as he directed. Of course, any
body would be nervous when one was
so badgered as was Julia. Although
he tried very hard, he did not do me
any harm, at least, that :is what I
think. * ,
â¢â¢But did .you ever see anything so
shameful," she continued, "as his offer
to my sister of her freedom if she
would promise- to testify against me
The sisters then embraced each
other and "Nan" said to Julia:
* "Don't you think the same . way,
Midget?"
"You bet I do." replied the sister.
'â T"hey could not make me say any
thing that would hurt you, 'Nan.'
Anyhow, there is not anything I could
any that would hurt you."
Miss Patterson continued: "What do
you think of Mr. Rand showing the
letter I wrote to Leslie Coggins? ; That
letter is : the one letter that every girl,
'at least once in her life, writes. I was
not on good terms with 'Caesar' Young
at ; that time. I was ' practically 'en
gaged to Mr. .Coggins. -He professed
to Ipve me very much, but now 1 feel
sure he was playing me false." Mr.
Coggins came to pee {me last f 'summer
in my cell here in the prison. He gave
me SCO. He told me how sorry ha
was for me and said: " 'Nan, now you
see what a mistake you have made by
not marrying me.' .*,
"I believe. now that all the time he
was calling. on me he was acting in
the Interest of Millln." : ' '

ways out of joint.
But his sincerity and patriotism can
not be disputed. No man has done
more to foster the volunteer movement.
It was forty-five years aso that he
first assumed command of a covds.
and his gift, the Elcho Challenge
Shield, still testifies to his practical in
terest in the body whose motto is "De
fence, Not Defiance." He has the
courage of his convictions at all times
and is never bothered by considera
tions of consistency. He has proclaim
ed both communism and individualism.
He once opposed the . habitual Ine
briates' bill in the House of Lords on
the ground that every Englishman
ought to be allowed to get drunk when
it pleased him to do so.
WEDS AT EIGHTY-TWO.
In his own person he furnishes the
best refutation of his jeremiads on
national decadence. Though he long
ago passed the age when must men are
supposed to have something more than
one foot in the grave, he is still sound
in wind and limb; is a keen sportsman,
hunts, fishes, drives his own motor car.
makes speeches full of fire and vieor
whenever the spirit moves him: writes
books and beguiles what leisure he has
left at his favorite hobbyâ sculpture.
When he was a widower of eiehtv
two, he married for the second time a
charming young bride, the daughter of
the late Major Blackburn, and niece of
the last baron of that name. He suc
ceeded to his title and some 60,000 acres
in Scotland in 1883.
He helped Sir Robert Peel reform
the corn JLaws and for more than three
score years has been in the thick of
every Parliamentary fight. His heir is
Lord Elcho, a man of forty-eight. One
year he moved the adjournment for
the Derby and the next year the
amendment against the House adjourn
ing, as Sir Wilfrid Lawson said. "Just
to see a horse race."

* A float and Ashore.
of t^ie passengers who arrived
here yesterday from Mexico on the
Ooast Steamship Company's
little white liner Curacao nearly lost
their lives through the blowing up of
a rasoline launch off the coast of
Lower California. The wrecked boat
remained afloat long enough to en
able the occupants to take a transfer
to a little tlat bottomed skiff, in which,
after fourteen houre of hard rowing,
they reached land. They tra
across the isthmus to Guaymas, where j
they boarded the Curacao. They were j
food and had only two drinks '
-iier in four days, during which
time they rovred and tramped under a
blistering srun. One member of the !
party was without shoes, but impro- i
vised * covering for hia feet from the {
canvas ripped from a Mfc preserver.
Thomas E. Adams and W. C. Frye
â were the two members of the Navajo's
company who reached here yesterday, j
Besides them on the boat were Cap
tain Gunn, who ran the engine and did
the navigating, and Ben Solberg, a
Norwegian gUmt who was deck hand
v:p to the time of the explosion, which
was of his causing. The Navajo had I
been on a prospecting trip and was
returning to Sap Diego. It was dis- '
covered that the gasoline tank was !
leaking. Solberg sought the leak with j
a match, ajid lound It. T^iis was on
March 1?, off Abrydos Point.
Ttte launch took fire and all hand**
had barely time to jump aboard their |
Â«kiff before the Navajo was enveloped !
In flame*. The explosion had torn a J
hole In the hulL and within a few j
: -s the latlnch disappeared in a I
cloud of st^am.
'r.g v.as saved from the latinch j
but a life preserver. Clothes, money (
and food went to the bottom with the
Navajo. None of the men had coats
. Solberg -was barefooted. Solberg
and Gunn took the oars and after four
houre of hard pulling land was
reached. Then followed tbe journey
acTOÂ«S the isthmus. They were in light
marching order, but very hungry and ;
thirsty, and not until within a few j
miles of Guayma* did they find any \
~ot two drink? of water ob
tained a.t wide intervals from traveling
'S and Gunn left the i
= t Ensenada and returned to t
. Adams managed to find a j
.md a pair of Jeggings. With the :
latter he was able to hide the raveled
ende of his trruser legs. Frye was at
m a little cloth cap, a -weater,
pautaiooiis and well-worn shoes. That

COMMUTERS FALL IN THE SIXTEENTH
Greatest Game of the Season
Ends With Thrilling Bat
ting Bally.
When a fan goes to the Eighth-street
j ball park these days he feels he Is be
ing bunkoed unless a few extra spasma
of ball are handed out. On Friday thir
1 teen rounds v.ere played before a. \vin
i ncr could be declared, and yesterday
iit was sixteen. The Ssals came up
; strongly in the fatal period and ham
mered in two runs. Score: San Fran
cisco, 6 ;. Oakland, 4.
Those sixteen innings contained as
much glorious baseball as any one
would wish to see. There was every
thing that goes to make the hear* of
â  the fan beat for joy. Double plays,
long hits, errors, bad decisions
and other happenings that can be seen
! only on a ball field. No such contest
! has been witnessed In the league this
j year.
The Commuters actually filled the
sacks in the fifteenth, yet there was
nothing in the way of a run. Streib
was safe when Murphy dropped the
ball, but Kelly forced him o at second.
Devereaux slammed one atÂ° Wheeler,
and he tossed the ball away, letting
' both runners advance. Whalen pur
| posely passed Francks and McMurray,
forcing Deveteaux at the plate.
Graham ended the round by flying to
left.
Then the Seals came back and won
the game in the sixteeenth. Hilde
started it for them by driving one past
Francks. Irwin bumped to right field,
and "Hilde went to third. Along came
! Murphy with a bingle, sending Hilde
i through, arid Cousin Parke Wilson was
j r.lso there with one that put Murphy
I over after he had run Irwin off at
j third base.
Oakland was not ready with the
come-back in their half of the six
1 teenth. With one down Kruger clout
ed the ball far out to deep left for a
double, but neither Dunleavy nor
Streib could chase him over, and the
great battle ended.
Both pitchers worked like pieces of
machinery, even after they had pitched
| nine long innings. They were both
j practically invincible when the game
! progressed to the extra stages, and
neither weakened till the sixteenth,
when the Seals got to Graham.
Both teams payed in all kinds of
hard lurk throughout the game. Oak
land had many changes to bring In
the decisive run, but the little hit
i always missed fire when it was need
(d. The Seals suffered from several
] close decisions when they had chances
Jto score. The score:
Oakland â ) San Francisco â

Seattle Fans See a Game
That Lasts as Long as
Ours.
SEATTLE, April 29.â Warren Hall
and Shields were in great form to-day
and engaged in a grand baseball bat
tle of sixteen innings. Shields should
have won his game in the regulation
nine innings, but the Seattle team al
lowed three pop hits to drop safely and
Los Angeles scored two runs and took
the lead. The Colts came back In their
half, however, and tied the score up
as tight as wax after two men were
out. Shields, Kane and Houtz hit in
a row, sending the run across. After
that it was three men up and out most
of the way until the final inning. Three
times Seattle got a man as far as third
with two men out, only to have him
left. In the final inning Houtz struck
out as an opener, but Miller belted a
safe one to left. Frary's out from
Brashear to Dillon moved Dusty up to
second* Then Jimmy McHale.with three
balls and two strikes on him, soused
! the ball in a line to right field. Cra-
J vath made a gallant try for the ball,
I but seeing he could not reach it he
j kissed his hand to the ball and trotted
for the clubhouse. The hit was good
for three bases, but McHale simply
trotted to first and then pulled on his
sweater. It was a hard game for
! either man to lose, for both pitchers
worked like machinery all afternoon.
Shields had the Indian sign on the left
handed hitters, striking out twelve
men. After the disastrous fifth inning,
when Los Angeles was presented witW
two runs, the hqme team braced up
and played great ball. The score:

McCreedie's Monsters Lose
Because Van Buren Is
Forced to Play First.
PORTLAND, April 29â With an
equal number of hits, four each, Ta
coma scored one run to-day and won.
The fans blamed the loss of the game
to Klopf, the big umpire. Klopf was
followed from the grounds by a hoot
ing, yelling mob, but no one seemed to
desire to come into personal contact
with him. It was a close decision on
a double play in the eighth, ihat would |
otherwise have put a Portlander on
third, that riled the fans. Thomas won
his sixth straight victory this season
and was in good form. French was
relieved by Garvin after the winning
run came in. Garvin allowed no hits
when he went on the slab. Had Van
Buren been out in the field when Me-
Laughlin and Lynch followed each
other with two-baggers and the one
tally, the result might have been dif
ferent. The score:

WHEELS CRUSH MAN'S ARMS.
OAKLAND. April 29. â Alphonso
Armstrong, 27 years of age, was the
victim of a terrible accident in trying
to board a freight train near the
13-street station this morning. He fell
and the wheels crushed both arms
above the and yet the rest of
his body was uninjured. How both
arms could have been cut off so far
ut> without other injury is inexplicable
to thje doctors.
He was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital as quickly as possible and Drs.
O. D. Hamlin, L. L. Riggin and J. M.
Kane took both his arms off close to
the shoulders. Armstrong came here
from Milwaukee. He has friends liv
ing at 484 South Pearce street in that
city.
STOLEN RIG IS RECOVERED.
OAKLAND, April 2SÂ». â A stranger
giving the name of William Hastings
hired a horse and buggy last Thurs
day from the livery stable of R. F.
Jackson, former secretary of the
Board of Public Works, at Telegraph
avenxÃ and Twerrfy-fourth street, and
failed to return. To-day the rig was
found in possession of George Achi
ton of Piedmont. Achlaon said that
he and A. E. Skinner purchased the
outfit from a stranger for $15.
Skinner was arrested last night on a
charge of drunkenness and in the
Police Court this morning he told a
weird story of having been held up
and robbed by two men near the gate
of Mountain View Cemetery.

BERKELEY, CAL..
EXPOSE STUDENT
VOTING SCANDAL
HlnkeVs Friends Give Warning
Declare That Illegal Registrations Will Not
Be Tolerated Any More.
BERKELEY. April â Although
John Hinkol, the Berkeley capitalist
rho was defeated by Thomas Rickard
for the Trusteeship of the Second
"Ward at the recent election, announced
a week ago that he did not intend to
contest the result, his friends to-day
made public a report of their investi
gation of the manner in whfch uni
versity students voted at the polls on
April 10.
The statement Issued is intended,
Kinkel'3 friends announce, as "a
warning to student voters who may
take part in future elections." The re
port follows:
"It appears on examination of the
Great Ketrfster of Alameda County
that 21*. students are registered for
voting in the Second Ward of Berke
ley, and that at the recent municipal
election 160 of these students voted.
"The Political Code, in determining ;
the right tc vote, says, in section 1239: '
'A person must not be held to have ]
graint'd or lost a residence by reason of
his presence or absence from a place
while employed in the service of
the United States or of this State nor
while engaged in navigation, nor while
a student at any Institution of learn
ing.'
"The section further sets forth: 'A j
person must not be considered to have j
gained a residencec in any precinct |
into which he comes for temporary j
purpose* merely, without the intention
Of making such precinct his home.'
"By examination of the records of \
the University of California it appears :
that 132 of said students who voted ]
had thtir permanent homes elsewhere, j
and therefore voted illegally, and 171
of the total registration is illegal for
the game reason; and from the records i
it appears that 15 of said students j
voted legally, and that as to 13 voting â 
there fp a reasonable doubt.
"It is not supposed that those stu
dents who cast illegal votes in this ,
iv ay did so intentionally, but their at- ]
tention is railed to the fact that if j
any of them vote illegally at any fu
ture election in Berkeley they will
commit a felony and render themselves
liable to arrest and prosecution."
FRIENDS PAY
LAST TRIBUTE
TO PIONEER
OAKLAND, April 29.â The funeral of

States Bureau of Immigration in San

tury.

America, the Knights of Columbus and
the Gaelic I/eague acted as an escort
of henor, and beautiful floral offerings
were also sent by all these organiza
tions. After a brief service at the fam
ily home the remains were removed
to St. Mary's Church, where solemn
high mass was celebrated by Father
Dempsey, assisted by the Rev. Father
Sesnon, the Rev. Father D. J. Nolan
and; the Rev. Father F. X. Morrison.

HUNDREDS ENJOY EXCURSION.
OAKLAND, April 2fc â More than
400 people from all parts of Alameda
Couriiy to-day enjoyed the excursion
given by the Alameda County Chris
tian Endeavor Union. The steamer
Queen, which had been chartered for
the occasion, left Broadway wharf in
San Francisco at 1:30, going through
the Golden Gate to a point about two
miles beyond the lightship. On the
return trip the excursionists visited all
the points of interest around the bay,
returning to the city about 6:30 p. m.
Mre. Rosa Gilbert Dies Suddenly.
OAKLAND, April 29. â Mrs. Rosa
Saville Gilbert died very suddenly at
her home near Beulah Station to-day
at the advanced age of 74 years. Mrs.
Gilbert died some time during the
afternoon. Her body was found at
6:30 in the evening by her daughter*
Anna, near the front door of the
house. Mrs. Gilbert was the widow of
John Gilbert and a native of New
York and leaves one daughter. Death
was presumably caused by heart dis
ease.
FATHER DENIED CHJJiD.
OAKLAND, April 29. â Judge Waste
to-day denied the petition of the
gyspy, De Meterio Branovlch, for the
guardianship of his daughter, Clara,
now in the custody of the mother, who
is married to a man named Frank
Stanley, a prinoe among the gypsies.
The child is to be sent to school, as
Judge Waste, said that he did not be
lieve either parent a proper person
to have the care of the child. The
mother says the father wished to
sell it.
CASE XEAR CLOSE.
OAKLAND, April 29.â Alice B.
Courtwright, charged with insanity,
took the stand in her own defense to
day and made a good witness for her
self. The case against her has been
materially weakened owing to en
forcement of the rules of evidence
and much that was told the doctors
who adjudged her insane upon her
examination has been withheld from
the Jury. The case will probably be
concluded on Monday.
Ravages hunt for a living and civi
lized men hunt fur ct.ay jobs.

SOCIETY WILL
BE GLADDENED
BY REST DAY
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE
OAKLAND, April 29.â Thank? be
that to-morrow will be Sunday, the day
of rest, and that sentirnerit will re-echo
in the heart of every rrraid and matron
in society, for the past week has been
as strenuous as the proverbial Roose
veltian career. There will be only the
one day's respite, however, for next
week will be almost as bad.
The blgr social event of the next
seven days will be the Smith-Oliver
wedding: at Arbor Villa, on the 3d. Only
relatives and Intimate friends will wit
ness the ceremony, but at 9 o'clock sev
eral hundred guests will have the privi
lege of congratulating the happy cou
ple. Mf. Oliver is fitting up a home for
his bride Just across the street from his
parents' residence, and many of*, the
beautiful furnishings are wedding
ffifts.
Then there will be the dedication of
the new annex to the Fabiola Nurses'
Home, which will bring out a crowd of
society folk. Mrs. Isaac Requa is
chairman of the building committee,
and she has devoted every moment to
the work, in which she is intensely in
terested. With the assistance of Miss
Julia Morgan, Oakland's talented
young architect, she has planned and
brought to completion one of the most
comfortable institutions of the kind on
the coast.
On Thursday next Mrs. Gilbert Cur
tis will be the hostess at what prom
ises to be- a brilliant affair, and in the
evening- of the same day society's at
tention will be divided by the musicale
in aid of St. Andrew's Episcopal
Church and the reception at the Home
Club in honor of General and Mrs.
Funston.
Last night the Palette, Lyre and Pen
Club gave its first open reception at
Maple Hall, and in spite of the fact
that some of the people destined to
shine on the programme failed to ma
terialize, the evening was a most en
joyable one.
There were a number of notable peo
ple present and the programme includ
ed some musicianly work by talented
members of the club. The first number
was a violin solo, "Chacone," by Vitali,
by Walter Manchester. Following were
the Instrumental solos, piano solo,
"Liebestraum" (Liszt), by Mrs. Mabel
Gray Lachmund; violin solo, Last
Movement of the Mendelssohn Con
certo, Mr. Manchester, and the Chopin
"â¢Ballade" concluded the programme.
Songs by Mrs. Grace Berdelini and
Clement Rowlands were sandwiched
between. It was Mr. Rowland's first
concert appearance since his return
from Europe, and it was much to be
regretted that he was too ill to respond
to the very enthusiastic encore accord
ed him. Mrs. Bardelini sang, among
other things, two songs by W. J. Mc-
Coy and was accompanied by the com
poser. Mr. McCoy, by the way, is a
prominent member of the club and
acted as chairman last evening. Miss
Lucy Hannibal was accompanist for
the singers with the one exception
when Mr. McCoy played.
At the conclusion of the programme
punch was served and the guests en-
Joyed a pleasant and informal visit.
Among those notable in the art world
who were guests last evening ware
Theodore Wores, Miss Annie Briggs H
D. Gremke and J. M. Griffin. Am6ng
others were Miss Alyce Gates, the well
known singer; Alfred Metzger, Mrs.
Luclan Langworthy, Alfred Wilkie,
Mrs. Bartholomew, Mrs. J. Torrey Con
nor, Mrs. Julia B. Foster, Miss Mary
Lambert, Mrs. Annie Brigman and Dr.
Depew.
Among the olub members whose
names are well known on tttls side of
the bay in a literary, musical or artis
tic way are Jack London, Charles
Woodbury, W. J. McCoy, C. P. Neilson,
Miss de Neale Morgan, Mrs. D. w!
Gelwicks, Mrs. Lachmund, Walter
Manchester, Mrs. Bardelini, Clement
Rowlands, A. T. Stewart, Joseph E.
Baker, Mrs. J. E. Baker. Mrs. Florence
Hardiman Miller, W. E. Rollins and
others.
The closing cotillon of the Friday
Night Club was a brilliant success.
Reed Hall was beautifully decorated
with ferns and carnations, and the
softened lights fell upon some of the
prettiest gowns worn this season.
Among those whose gowns were con
spicuously pretty were Miss Criseie
Taft, Miss Edith Selby, Miss Lillian
Isaacsâ in a spangled white lace over
pink chiffonâ Miss Katherine Brown,
Miss Rose Kales, Miss Ruth Kales,

COMPANY NEEDS
ALL ITS LAND
Southern Pacific Declines to
Turn Over .Plaza Property
to the Town of Berkeley
REQUEST IS DENIED
Clerk Merrill Eeceives Let
ter From Superintendent
Palmer Explaining Matter
BERKELEY, April 29.â With re
grets, the Southern Pacific Company
informs the people of Berkeley, as rep
resented by their town government,
that the company is unable to grant
the request that land formerly used by
the railroad corporation for freight
yards in the heart of the city be given
to Berkeley for park purposes.
Town Clerk Merrill, as directed by
the Trustees, wrote to the corporation
several weeks ag:o, Indicating the town
government's desire that the land be
donated for public purposes. It waa
proposed to lay out a pretty plaza on
the spot that for so long a time was
an eyesore in the university town.
Clerk Merrill to-day received the fol
lowing letter from Superintendent W.
S. Palmer:
"Dear Sir: Replying to your recent
communication relative to the sugges
tion that the Southern Pacific Com
pany turn over to the town of Berke
ley for Improvement as a public park
their property between Stanford place,
Shattuck avenue, University avenue
and Center street, I beg to advise that
in view of the possible change in con
ditions requiring the use of this prop
erty for railroad purposes, our man
agers do not feel in a position to
adopt the suggestion quoted.
"We trust, however, when the plans
we have in view for the Improvement
of the property in question are carried
out, the people of the town of Berke
ley will have no cause for complaint."

LOST IS GRAVE
OF POCAHONTAS
Plan to Bring Remains
of the Indian Princess
to America Will Fail
FIKKS WRECK TOMB
Coffin in Which Savior of
John Smith Was Buried
Cannot He Distinguished
Special DUpatch to The Call.
LONDON, April 29.â The Virginians
who are counting upon removing the
bones of Pocahontaa, the Indian Prin
cess, from Gravesend to Jamestown.
Va., are likely to be disappointed, as
all trace of these interesting remains
has been lost.
According to the generally accepted
story Pocahontas was taken with
' smallpox just as she and Captain Rolfe
were starting back to Virginia, died in
her husband's arms on the sailing day
and was buried in the rector's vault of
i Gravesend's parish church. But the
present church is the third to serve
the little parish, and the flrÂ»s which
destroyed the previous two buildings
did their work so well that now the
locations of the original vaults can only
be guessed at. In rebuilding the chan
cel many years ago the late rector, Dr.
Haslam, discovered a number of the
curious, barrel-shaped coffins of early
seventeenth century pattern, but these
were so charred and corroded that the
rector could team nothing about their
occupants.
The Virginians' proposal, however,
has raised considerable discussion in
London, and has drawn from one
writer a half-column of doubt as to
whether Pocahontas ever was an In
dian Princess anyway and whether she
came here as the wife of John Rolfe.
This iconoclast declares that Pocahon
tas was an Indian adventuress brought
to England as a speculation by the
Governor of Virginia for exhibition
purposes, and that she was called a
Princess to make her more Interesting.
" More than a year ago a party of en
thusiastic Virginians who were "do
ing" London and vicinity got on a train
and went down to Gravesend. They
were so pleased with their visit that
they promised the parish church a pul
pit built from solid oak cut at James
town. The pulpit has not turned up.
A party of ladies, also from the vi
cinity of Jamestown, some time ago
promised to send from home a stained
glass window as a memorial to Poca
hontas. The window has not appeared.
Gravesenders are hoping that if the
American patriots send an envoy to
undermine their church in search of
Pocahontas' bones he will bring along
that pulpit and memorial window.

Electricity vs. the Muse.
A danger from the electric mining
locomotive Is the bare trolley wire or
third rail, which cannot always be kept
out of reach, and which no regulations
will keep men from touching, i can
state from personal experience on sev
eral occasions that 220 volts direct cur
rent may be tr.ken on the head and
even through a pair of gold spectacles
without fatal results to a man of or
dinary strength. Nevertheless a num
ber of miners, presumably men with
weak hearts, are killed each year by
such low voltage, and higher pressure
or alternating currents are of course
more dangerous. Accident reports
show, however, that almost as many
men are killed, and vastly more are in
jured annually, by being kicked or bit
ten by horses and mules, and these
amiable animals have the added dis
advantage underground of fouling the
air to five or six times the extent of
an equal number of men. Stables are
also responsible for a considerable per
centage of all serious mine fires. â En

TITLE TO BEACH
LAND AT ISSUE
Board of Park CoiirmissioneM
Listens to Arguments on
Behalf of R. H. totaling
RESERVED FOB PUBLIC
Opinion of City Attorney
as to Original Survey to
Guide Officials in Mattel
In executive session yesterday after
noon the Board of Park Commissioners
examined maps and surveys of Golden
Gate Park lines on the ocean beach. R.
M. Hotaling claims a half-acre of land
near the Cliff House, and the Commis
sioners maintain that the land in tiues
tion waj rof rvetl by ordinance and
dedicated to public use.
Attorney Alex Heyneman and an
other representative of Mr. Hotaling,
sought to convince Commissioners A.
B. Spreckfls, Reuben H. Lloyd and
Earl Cummings that the land waa
deeded by the city to Mr. Hotaling, who
proposes to erect valuable improve
ments thereon.
After hearing argurr nt 3in the cÂ«Â»e
the Commissioner decided to refer the
subject to the City and County At
torney, it is contended that the city
cannot give title to lands that ha\
been reserved for park purposes ancl
dedicated to public use. It appears
that several Burveys have been mad"
since the original lines of the great
highway were established.
The Commissioners are not disposed
to relinquish the eity"s right to any
part of the park domain reserved by
ordinance for the benefit of the people.
SEVERE OPTICAL TESTS
FOR RAILROAD MEN
Some Peculiar Cases of Inability to
Distinguish Between Colors
Developed.
Tests for defective syesight on all
members of railroad train crews are
much more severe and frequent than
thye were a few years ago. The rea
sons for these tests are obvious, as the
safety of every moving tm
mainly upon the clearness of vis,
the men having it in charge. In these
tests color blindiv the most
trouble and is a constant menace to all
trainmen, as the ina.bii,ity to name cor
rectly the different colors at a glance
Ss followed by instant dismissal from
the service. â¢
A peculiar case was brought to light
recently when a conductor on a cer
tain road was being put through the
test. He had been running a passen
ger train several years, had never met
with an accident and was deemed one
o f the best men on -the road. When
the different colors were placed be
fore him singly he called them cor
rectly at a glance, but when two or
more colors were presented he vai
wholly unable to tell one from an
other. The officials of the company
were sorry for him. but. of course,
were forced to let him go.
Physicians seem unable to discover
to just what cause this affliction Is
due. They claim that some persons
are born with it, while it comes upon
others without warning i-t any time f
life, and unless put t< the test the vic
tim will never know that he is so af
flicted. â Chicago Journal.
A Narrow Escape.
The court lester had been summoned
to appear before the King.
"We have arranged for a funersT to
morrow." said the royal pesonagre. "and
you are to occupy the wagon with glass
windows."
"W-why." stammered the clown,
"w-what have I d-drme to d-deserv-s
this g-great and g-ghostly honor?"
"We have it from a reliable source."
answered the King, "that you allud*Â«i
to us as 'His Knobs' in the kitchen last
night."
"Oh. sire." cried the wily Jester. "I
admit the truth of the accusation. Tt
was a new way I had just discovered
of proclaiming that you were some
thing to adore. See?"
Whereupon his high mightiness, who
had never even seen a comic almanac,
was so tickled that he proceeded to
borrow half a dollar of the wise fool.
after which the funeral waa postponed
indefinitely. â Chicago Journal.
The London Telephone GlrL
The hated sumptuary laws for tele
phone girls are to disappear condi
tionally. They were stringent, unques
tionably. The girl who came to work
in the morning with a colored comb in
her hair wan fined; the girl who
dressed in a colored blouse must wear
a dreadful black overall, and there was
a black book for girls who put on
beads. For six months the telephone
girls are to dress as they please, with
the understanding that if the privilege
is abused things will revert to their
former hideousnesa. We hope they
will be happy and clever, and pay great
attention to what they are told.
Something has been wrong with them,
notoriously. Put if they will settle
down nowâ talk less about what they
wear and attend to the telephones â
the state of busy London will be more
endurable.â Pall Mall Gazette.AUnit2{F^to3Ny/3lOffiG3rT3!is

Yield to Heavy Pressure
NEW YORK, -April. 29.â Tbe condi
tion of distrust in = the stock market,
which has been growing for some
time,, broke. < into a. furious storm of
liQUidation to-day and swept away all
support. Selling under pressure of ne
cessity found practically no demand to
meet It and the "comprehensive slump
in â¢ prices was the Jresult. Tli^ "weak
ness was multiplied, by "the* decline In
prices, and many -additional offerings
were forced on the market by lend
ers of money, solicitious for the value
of their collateral, by speculators r de
slrious of limiting losses and by
holder* on margin .who were forced
out by their '"brokers as the margins
were wiped but. The conditions Â»vhich
resulted were those of panic. The pro
fessional bear *" operators,' of t course;
added their efforts' to aggravate : the
decline, "the urgency of. the selling and
the lack of confidence argued by f the
small demand to buy at any stage of
the decline naturally' 'gave'- rise, to
many rumors of financial difficulties.
The pressure under which the â¢ mem
bers of speculative pools and various
stock market plungers .were, laboring
was sufficiently obvious, but to this
were added fears of financial weakness
in more important quarters... Nothing
developed affecting intrinsic couditibns
to account for the enormous liquida
tion. \ ' < ' ;s; s :r.
, The bank statement made a strong
showing, the considerable loan 4 reduc
tion, together with an effective in
crease in. cash, expanding 4 the volume
of the surplus by from more than one
third r of a million dollars to nearly
J1, 000,000/ The break in the nlarket
could not b% traced to money market
'conditions,' although next week's heavy
requirements received some co'nsldent
tion. The torle at'fhe 4-lcsing gave no
clear evidence that the storm had
passed, prices in ftme cases closing
at the* lowest, with the furious activity
unabated. . , . o
The extreme losses extended very
generally from 1" to 4 points, and for
Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh there
w.^s a decline of 11H. Northwestern
preferred *%. C, C, C. and St. Louis
8. Atlantic Coast Line 7U, United
States Rubber preferred 7%, New York
Central 8 7 and for an extensive list Â£>f
active^ stocks from 4 to 5%, the latter
figure* for St. Paul. Total sales of
bonds, par value, $1,940,000.
The stock .market this week has
been given over to paying the -penalty
of the unbridled speculation which has
been rampant The process of let
ting out speculative influence in the
stock market and in the wheaf market
has .intensified the penalties.' The
'parallel speculation in tHe stock mar
ket and in wheat was believed to be
largely in the same hands, so that
each market was highly sensitive to
the course of events in the pther.
Many observers hold the view that the
collapse of the wheat corner was* al
most entirely responsible for the over
throw of the speculative fabric of the
stock market. Â«. * ' * c . /Z*
It is e^t down that a great specula^
tion has foeen carried to- a culmination
In face of "' such a body of opposing'
conservative sentiment Â©jf frequently
uttered warning and of authoritative
disclaimers of the rumors on which
the advance in prices was based Erac
tically all of these various siyapt>sltl|na
were suddenly abandoned this week
and a3 a consequence stocks wife sold
by those who had bought In the fa.ith
thaf the suppositions were true. â¢ A
cloud o* these rumors; had v centered
about the Northern Securities Com
pany and the beginning of the acttfkl
dissolution of that company' and- the
distribution of its assets has been the
principal factor o in discrediting 0 them.
The resignation of George. Gould,
from the Union Pacific board to give
attention to tlfe Western Pacific was
looked upon as a measure of compe
tition, and the question raised over the
old Carnegie Company â¢ contract ' fot
United States Steel tonnage to the
Gould roads was regarded as another
threat of reprisals for>grievances else
where, o * " : -
Mich influence must be allowed for
the sentimental* effect of the revela
tions of 'the great, bank Â°defalcntion at
Milwaukee, due to speculation in
wheat. Aside from the actual loss in
volved, a spread of suspicion ds the in-"
evitable ':. result, with unfavorable, ef
fect on the state of general cpnfidence,
which is bo important an element, in
the prosperity of business.
I.cng:x:c Will Ilcnew Pleilges.
The annual renewal of pledges :of
the League of the Cross will be held
in St. Mary's Cathedral at 2 o'clock .
this , rternoon. The members of, the,
leag-ue will march ' from the various
parishes â of the city ; to the cathedral,
where the league cadets will also as-*
semble. The ceremony, is most im
pressive, especially, the ; singing of t the
hymns. Two thousand boys will join
in the singing,, accompanied by * the
orgran and -the regimental^ band ; of
fifty pieces. Archbishop Montgomery
will deliver : an appropriate l discourse v
and administer the pledge ;of - tern
pcrance for the coming year to the
boys. Immediately '- after ' the â  church
ceremony there will be a review of the
cadet regiment on Van- Ness avenue.

THE SAN FRAXCTSCO CALL', SUNDAY. "APRIL' 30, ll>o3.
GAIETY REIGNS
IN CORINTHIA
One of the largest and gayest gath
erings that has ever been seen at
Tiburon assembled yesterday to do
honor to the opening of the season of
the Corinthian Yacht Club.
Crewels of yachtsmen and their
friends went over to Tiburon by tbe
1:50 p. m v boat trom the city, and were
received by the diiectors of the club,
acting as a committee. Music was
provided, and dancing went on in the
main hall. In the intervals between
the dances Frank W. Thompson, Frank
Rodolph and C. T. Wendell sang solos.
Many parties of ladies paid visits to
the yachts lying at their moorings in
the cove. The pleasure craft, spick
and span with new paint and fresh
varnish, were decked out from stem
to stern with a brave array of flutter
ing flags. The cabin of Fulton G. Ber
ry's sloop, Nixie 1 ; was handsomely dec
orated with flowers.
Among the craft lying at anchor were
Commodore T. Jennings' sloop Speed
well, Vice Commodore J. C. Brickell's
sloop CJenesta, Frank Stone's enlarged
and improved Presto, the racing sloop
Corinthian and J. W. Pew*'' 1 Rebuilt
Truant. Commodore W. G. Morrow of
the San Francisco Yacht Club cruised
over from Sausalito in the sloop Chal
lenger. Other boats flying the San
Francisco burgee were the schooner
Chispa, sloops White Heather and
Phoenicia and the launch Petrel. The
Olympic represented the Vallejo Yacht
ing Club.
Shortly after C o'clock a Corinthian
supper was served to the hungry tars,
and in the evening the annual jinks
took place in the main hall, which was
entitled for the occasion "Jennings and
Brlckell's Rotisserie."
The principal parts in "Ye Sign of
Ye Old Brown Hat" were taken by
Dave Mcl-aughlin. Bob Mitchell, Larry
Harris, Clarence Wendell, Frank
Thompson, Pete Sloan, Charley Hay
and other well-known amateurs.
Among the singers were Ossie Franks,
Fred Knight, Billy Hynes, Ben Tarbox,
Eddie Angelo and B. F. Sagar.
This morning colors will be made at
8 a. m. on signals from the flagship,
and at 10 o'clock captains will report
on board the commodore's vessel. At
11, if the wind favors, the fleet will
st'trt on the opening cruise of the
season.

As an aftermath of a lawsuit over
a bill of $10, A. Poeta Is suffering a
deep cut on the side of the head, in
flicted yesterday with a sharp instru
ment in the hand of G. Rondella. The
injured man lives at 726% Bush
street, -while his assailant resides at
CBS on the same street. The trouble
grew out of a dispute over $10 worth
of material and labor bestowed by
Rondella, who is a tailor, on Poeta's
garments. The wound was dressed
b> Dr. Kucich at the Emergency Hos
pital. Poeta swore to a complaint
against Rondella.

PLAN TO JOIN
TWO ROADWAYS
The Point Lobos Improvement Club
is agitating the connection of Sutter
and Clement streets, in the Richmond
district, by cutttng a way through a
portion of the Laurel Hill Cemetery
from Presidio avenue west to First
avenue. Following the accomplishment
of the plan, which will mean much to
the residents on Sutter and -Clement
streets, the club will actively advocate
a conduit system of underground trol
ley on the Sutter street road.
G. A. Blank, president of the club, is
enthusiastic over the proposition. Ac
cording to a charter provision the resi
dents of Sutter street may, if a suffi
cient number is polled, have the privi
lege of street extension. Mr. Blank
says that in conference with one of the
representatives of the cemetery the
plan met with a favorable reception,
and that the club will now actvely
prosecute the business of getting the
necessary signatures.
It is not proposed that the affair
shall be a land grab, as the Drice the
club is willing to pay for the small
strip of the cemetery Is in the neigh
borhood of $200,000, which the residents
of Sutter and Clement streets must
pay. The tax is not expected, however,
to average more than $6 per resident,
as the assessment will cover a half
block on each side of Sutter and Clem
ont streets from Jones to Thirty-fifth
avenue.
One of the important reasons for the
energetio campaign to secure the ex
tension is that houses are being put up
west of the cemetery and in the line
of the proposed cut. It will be neces

BATTLE TO OUST
THE GRAFTERS
Forces Are Organizing Under
Banner of San Francisco
League of Republicans
CRUSADE IS , POPULAR
Voters to Have Opportunity
to Support Candidates
of the Highest Character
George D. Clark, president, and Dan
| iel A. Ryan, secretary of the San Fran
i cisco Republican League, have re-
I turned to the city from Monterey. In
! company with many other prominent
I Native Sons they attended the annual
session of the Grand Parlor in the his
j toric old capital of Californja.
The news of the defalcation and
I flight of Tax Collector Ed J. Smith
reached A. Ruef of the Schmitz admin
istration at Monterey. Simultaneously
!at that place Treasurer J. E. Mc-
Doifgald got the information that
i Smith had absconded with a great
| quantity of loot. The usually placid
: and easy-going custodian of the mu
nicipal cash box was distressed over
; the tidings. Ruef assumed an air of
j ja&ed depression, exclaiming, "See how
; it is; I cannot leave San Francisco for
a day without something of this kind
| happening." The remark impressed the
I listeners with the, notion that Ruef
sizes mv himself as the agent who is
responsible for everything that is done
or left undone in San Francisco. T,he
; co.mment of the boss was not accepted
as flattering c to the Sohmitz end of the
local government. The Mayor under
; the blessed new charter is supposed to
] know something as to what Is going on
in the City Hall; If he cannot keep tab
on his associates in office by counting
. the coin from time to time he might
j follow the example of one at his Hlas
, trious predecessors and "heft" it.
Ruef did not receive a cordial greet
ing at Monterey from the Native Sons
.of the interior. His record^ as the agent
I of the Schmitz administration was the
; - topic of commeÃt ; in undertones. Ruef
announced publicjy that he would not
put up a fight against the forces of the
San Francisco Republican^ League for
control of the nominating convention
of the ( party. He indicated, however,
that he would oppose the Republioan
ticket at the general election in No
vember.
The new quarters of the Peague at Â«36
; Market Street will soon be ready for |
; occupancy. The opportunity; of joining
in. the movement for Better "local gov c - .
eminent will- be presepteU to every;
voter of San Francisco. An. address
outlining the purposes of the new or- > ;
ganization will be taailed to every reg
istered citizen of the metropolis. A re- i
turn postaPcard will go with the ad- â¢
dress. â
In the appointment of Assembly dis- j
trici committees the patriotic citizens
who are leading the crusade for better i
government of .the town will endeavor 0 i
to recognize all the elements of good
dtisenship. -From every Assembly dis
trict word comes that the mechanics,
merchants, lawyers, doctors, business
â¢ny >, wage earners and tax-paying cit
izens generally are earnestly in favor \
of a change in the administration of |
local affairs. The people want some- !
thing in return for the vast sums of I
money annually paid into the city
treasury. It seems to the tax-paying
citizens that legions of loafers, ballot
box stuffers and grafters are nourish
ed at public expense; that money
which should be expended in clean
ing the streets and sewers is squan
dered, stolen or frittered away.
Inland politicians of the machine
type are perceptibly disturbed over
the turn of affairs in San Francisco.
They apprehend that George D. Clark,
D. A. Ryan, U. J. Welch. Fairfax H.
Wheelan, James A. Wilson, John
Lachman, David Rich. J. Bowes,
John P. Daly and other active men
of the league are creating an alliance
for use in State politics; but the ap
prehension is not well founded. The
voters of the city will not be called on
this year to elect Congressmen, State
officers or members of the Legislature.
The way is clear for a tree and open
municipal contest. The Republican
party proposes to place before the peo
ple as candidates for delegates to the
local nominating convention the best
citizens of the community. The voters
at the primary election in August next
will be asked to elect these candidates.
If the purposes of the Republican
League should be executed men of
known character and ability will be
nominated by the convention. It is ,
quite well understood now that all the j
looters and grafters of the town will j
oppose the movement for better local !
government.

DEATH OF SERVANT WHO
POISONED PANCAKES
Seventeen- Year-Old Rose Holsworth
Receives Fatal Injnries by Falling
From Third-Story Window.
Rose Holsworth, the servant girl
who attempted to poison the Jackson
family last October by mixing ratsbane
with pancakes, died at the Park Emer
gency Hospital at 1:10 o'clock yester
day morning. Death was the result of
Injuries sustained last Thursday morn
ing in a fall from a third-story window
at 265 Devisadero street. At the time
of the accident she was working as a.
house servant in the family of Mrs. A.
J. Bryant and was cleaning a window,
but lost her balance and fell to the
ground. She was only 17 years old at
the time of her death.
On October 27 of last year the fam
ily of Mrs. H. L. Jackson at 2650 Mar
ket street observed that the pancakes
had an unusually bitter taste. A
chemical analysis showed that they
contained rat poison. Rose Holsworth
was on friendly terms with all the
family and there was absolutely no
motive on her part for the crime.
Medical experts ascertained that the
young woman was temporarily de
mented on account of sickness. She
afterward completely recovered her
reason.

he loaned the company and himself in
directly, $41,000 of the bank's funds.

FRANCE DEFIES
OLD-TIME FOE
LONDON, April : 29.â 1n the signifi
cant exchange of courtesies between
King Edward and President Loubet to-,
morrow the French public finds so
much cause for elation that the.anti-
Gerruan feeling over Morocco is explod
ing in .Paris newspapers ordinarily re
served in allusion to Berlin. Nothing
approaching the candor of some of
their utterances marked any previous
discussion of Emperor William's policy
at any point of international interest.
Paris" is emboldened by the approba
tion of Delcasse's course by the Gov
ernment, for the masses of the French
nation have unbounded confidence in
their great Foreign Minister, and they
resented the prospect of his discomfit
ure in a duel of wits with the Kaiser.
His vindication and the presence of Ed
ward have combined to raise the public
to a high pitch of confidence. Germany
is sneeringly invited to contemplate her
own isolation and to take any steps she
may think expedient.

arrange a special commercial treaty be
tween Germany and Morocco, in an in
terview to-day outlined the German at
titude toward Morocco in connection
with the Anglo-Frenoh agreement. He
said that Germany did not recognize
French influence in Morocco and sought
to establish the status quo prior to the
Anglo-French agreement. The Count
said Germany regarded Morocco as a
neld for development by Germans, un
der the protection of the German Gov
ernment.

Terrific Storm Makes
Ruin of the City
. of Laredo,
GREAT BUILDINGS WRECKED
Seminary and Hospital
Structures Fall Be
fore Gale,
DEATH LIST MAI INCREASE
LAREDO. Tex., via Bermuda, April
29.â Sixteen persons were killed and
scores injured in Laredo by a tor
nado which tore through the city late
last night. Rumors of others killed
in places outside Laredo are heard, but
as yet lack confirmation, except that it
is known that five perished in New
Laredo, Mex. The property damage is
large.
The damage wrought at the Laredo
Seminary la severe. Not one of the
group of magnificent buildings which
make up that institution escaped. The
barracks, the Primary building and
Etn n ry Hall were damaged from 50 to
per cent.
The escape from death of the teachers
at present quartered in the institution
is considered miraculous, as the walls
of some of the structures which they
occupied were completely demolished.
Mrs. Eastley, one of the teachers, was
heroically rescued by several cadet
students of the Institution, they low
ering her by a rope from a second
story. She was badly bruised.
The Mexican Natiunal Hospital build
ing's roof was lifted off. The hospital
was crowded with patients.
A trip through the town fails to show
a locality that has not Suffered more
qr less lroui th<.' storm. Trees, fences,
telegraph and - telephone poles, corru
gated roofs, chimneys and walls and
debris of all imaginable kinds strew
the streets.
CLEAKIXG THE WRECKAGE.
The city authorities are at work
cleaning away the wreckage of the
storm and to-night the city began to
resume its customary appearance.
Linemen are at work endeavoring to
straighten the tangle of wires and it
is believed that within two days the
electric- light service can be resumed.
It is Jioped to re-establish telegraph
communication, at least partially,
within two days.
Conditions in New Laredo, across
the Rio Grande, are similar. It is not
officially known how many dead or in
jured there are in that city, but at
least five persons perished. The five
kuown dead, added to the list of dead
on this side of the river, would bring
the total up to twenty-one.
The storm made its appearance from
the southwest, in the neighborhood of
Lampasas, Mexico, seventy-two miles
from this city, and it is reported that
great havoc was wrought in that local
ity, although it is not believed that
any loss of life resulted.
. BIG BUILDINGS DEMOLISHED.
' When the storm struck this city the
huts occupied by the poorer residents
were the first to be leveled. As the
wind increased in force the more sub
stantially constructed buildings were
unroofed, and, in many cases, demol
ished! The lightning vividly
and continuously, adding to the fears
of the populace. The storm lasted about
one hour.
The Mexican National has tempo
rarily abandoned its trains on account
of lack of telegraph wires over which
to arrange meeting points.
Physicians arc busy attending to the
injured. Dr. H. J. Hamilton of the
United States Marine Hospital service,
has placed 150 tents with bedding, etc.,
at the disposal of the homeless.
Governor Lanham was appealed to
by Mayor Sanchez of L#aredo for aid.
In response to this request Governor
Lanham issued a general appeal for
help, expressing the wish that Texans
in general be liberal ai.d prompt in
their help.

SAN RAFAEL, April 29.â Boyd Me
morial Park, dedicated to the memory
of Seth and Jack Boyd, deceased sons
of Mr. and Mrs. John F. Boyd, was
formally presented to the city of San
Rafael to-day with appropriate cere
monies. The day was perfect.
A parade started at 2 o'clock from the
corner of Fourth and E streets, with
Grand Marshal Vanderbilt and his aids
in the lead. Then came the Fifth Regi
ment, N. G. C, band, followed by Com
pany D, N. G. C, a horse and infantry
corps from Mount Tamalpais Military
Academy, the pupils of the Hitchcock
Military Academy In uniform, San Ra
fael Fire Department, carrtages con
taining the city officials, members of
the committee, speakers of the day, St.
Vincent's Orphan Asylum band and the
school children of the city, 800 strong,
carrying in their hands branches of
palms, sprays of roses and orange blos
soms and flags.
Around the park those participating
in the parade separated into two lines
extending on each side the main drive
way to the speakers' stand erected in
the children's playground.
IjUTHER BIRBAXK SPEAKS.
The ceremonies were opened with an
invocation by Dr. Arthur Crosby. It
was followed by "America," sung by a
chorus of 800 school children.
Chairman Moorhead then introduced
Luther Burbank, the noted horticul
turist, who said, in part:
"Trees, plants and flowers are always
educators in the right direction. They
make vm haDPlef and better. Cherish
these beautiful trees and plants cared
for by those who now for your perpet
ual joy. happiness and improvements
have given them to you. What a gra
cious gift this is toward your peace
and happiness you may hardly know
yet, but time will show its value to
you. Every tree, shrub and flower
which you see is the result of love,
care and culture. Each one has a daily
message of cheer for you."
Burbank was followed by Judge Mor
row, who in a happy speech presented
the gift deed to the city of San Rafael
Pages 39 to 52
Special Disjxitrh to The Call.
in behalf of Mr. and Mrs. John F.
Boyd. He said in part:
"For many years the beautiful
grounds where we are now assembled
have constituted the private park and
gardens connected with the residence
of our fellow townspeople, Mr. and
Mrs. John F. Boyd. It has been the
field and home of joyous life and has
had many fond associations for this
happy family. When Seth and Jack,
the two noble sons of Mr. and Mrs.
Boyd, passed away these pleasant as
sociations became a happy memory,
which they generously determined to
perpetuate in the enjoyment these
grounds might give to others. They
accordingly proposed to donate thi3
park to the crty of San Rafael in me
moriam of those two splendid San Ra
fael boys. Their offer was very cor
dially accepted by the Board of Trus
tees and has since been enthusiastical
ly confirmed by the general public."
DEEDS ARE PRESENTED.
Judge Morrow then turned and ad
dressed the school children who were
grouped among the trees in tne rear
of the rostrum as follows:
"Let me say one word to the children
who have assembled here to-day. These
grounds are especially designed for
yuur recreation and enjoyment. They
are entrusted to your keeping and it
he for you to take such interest in the
preservation of their beauty and im
provement as though they were a part
of your homes. The planting of trees
and the growth of flowers along these
paths should be your fondest care, and
taking suggestions from these grounds
you will improve and beautify your
own homes and your own lives."
Judge Morrow then handed, with ap
propriate words, the deed to Judge
Lennon, who received it in behalf of
the city of San Rafael In his usual elo
quent and impressive manner.
Judge Morrow, in behalf of the
Ladies' Improvement Â»Mub, then pre
sented Mr. and Mrs. Boyd with a set
of handsomely engrossed resolutions,
thanking them for their generous gift.
To the singing of the "StÂ»r-Spangled
Banner" by the school chihiiren the flag
was then unfurled on the new flagpole
that stands near the park entrance.
Each school, both private and public,
planted a tree. Refreshments, consist
ing of icecream, cakes and lemonade,
were then served to those present.
Mr. and Mrs. Boyd have spared
neithers pains nor expense to maka
everything within the park gates sub
stantial and lasting. Mr. Boyd bought
three additional pieces of land to com
plete the park since he made the orig
inal offer to the city.
BUBOXIC PLAGUE CLAIMS
MANY VICTIMS IN CHILE
Recent Arrivals From Stricken Port
Tell of Awful Ravages
of Disease.
SAN ANTONIO, Texas. April 29.â
Passengers from Chilean ports, accord
ing to a dispatch to the Express from
Mazatlan. Mexico, bring the first full
information concerning the terrible
ravages of bubonic plague in the city
of Pisagua. < 'hile. For some time be
fore their departure the deaths in Pis
a&ua had ranged from ten to thirty a
day and the authorities were theu un
able to enforce burials. Corpaea wÂ«r*
thrown into the streets to decompoas
and spread contagion.
But little headway had been made fn
the flght against the disease, and it
seemed as though the entire population
of that Chilean port might be exter
minated by the plague. Many persona
attempting 'to escape from the stricken
city were shot dowr by the soldiers oa
guard.

The North Star Mines Company in
Nevada County will build a trolley line
to connect with Its mine, the central
mill and a new cyanide plant, doing
away with wagons to move ore.
Eight hundred acres of land in Perm
Valley. Nevada County, have been
bonded on the supposition that dredg
ing for gold thereon will yield rich re
turns.
A complete shut down of the Kes
wick smelter has been ordered, to be
effective May 1.
The La Grange mine in Trinity
County, which has been sold. will, ac
cording to local reports, be greatly im
proved by the purchasers. Something
like $600,000 has been expended on this
large hydraulic property.
These are a few of the recent lead
ing projects of general interest in the
mining way:
The Scott Valley Advance reports
that much is implied for the
the Salmon River mining district and
for Etna in the discovery of a ledge in
the lower levels of the Advance mine.
"There is no doubt," so the Advance
says, "that the Liberty mining district
will have a rush, as all the nÂ«w dis
coveries are realizing handsomely."
The La Grange mine Is one of the
largest hydraulic propositions on the
coast. The original owner waa Janes
Ward. He sold to the Trinity Gold
Mining Company, wnlch had varying
success. In 1892 Baron Ernest La
Grange became the owner and he
constructed the Chaumont ditch to
Rush Creek, which was extended later
to Stuart's fork. With its pipes, flumes
and siphons the ditch was considered
to be a great engineering triumph.
Baron La Grange died about six years
ago and the control of the company
has been changed since his death.
Foreign stockholders wished to sell.
The property was under bond two
years before anything was effected.
The company has been operating thir
teen years.
The Jim Wayne mine in the Grouse
Ridge district, in Nevada County, has
been bonded to San Francieco parties.
The annual report of the Central
Eureka mine, in Amador County,
shows that dividends amounting to
$318,740 were paid last year and a bal
ance of $20,000 remained in the treas
ury.
The Amador Ledger reports that the
last payment on the Bay State mine
has been made and it is now the prop
erty of the Rhetta Consolidated Com
pany, which also owns the Rhetta and
the Kretcher mines.
James H. Leggett, so reports the
Plumas National Bulletin, will inspect
a tract of 200 acres in riumas County
at Englifh Bar and Feis Flat, on the
middle fork of Feather River, expect
ing to establish gold dredging.
J. B. Ferris reports from Kern
County that there is a great outlook for
the Amelia Mining district, which lies
between Kernville and Randsburg.
There are many large ledges and op
erating mines are getting out rich ore.
H. H. Blood, Mr. Blodgett of Bakers
fleld, W. D. Chase and Dr. Burson
are among those largely concerned in
operating mines.
GOOD MINES ARE MART.
In a long article the Mountain Mes
senger recapitulates the facts relating
to the mining wealth of Sierra County.
There are 119 quartz mines in the
county, 80 drift mines, several mines
of silver and Iron and 45 mills and
arastras. It Is estimateld that there
are 200 miles of undeveloped ancient
river channels that carry gold. River
channels that have been worked, so the
Messenger asserts, have yielded $1,000,
000 in one mile of distance. A large
body of high grade iron ore is twelve
miles north of Downieville. Some
other statements in the Messenger con
cerning the mineral deposits of the
county are as follows:
Most of the channels that are being worked
are those that have been crossed by deep ra
vines or canyons which have cut through the
deep lava covering and exposed the gravel, thus
affording the miner an opportunity of com
mencing the extraction of the rich gravel with
cut the expense of a long, nard rock tunnel.
The Keystone mine, now the property of
the Alta Sierra Mining Company, waa a great
producer up to vwenty-Cve years ago, when
the shaft reach^Hl a depth where It was neces
sary to equip the mine wltn neavier machinery
or run a loiig tunnel. Tne Alta Sierra Com
pany has Just completed a tunnel nearly a
mile in length and built a ten stamp mill.
Sierra County contains some of the >IdÂ»st
quartz mines in this State. The Sierra Buttes
mine at Sierra City has been in continuous' op
eration for fifty -five years and has produced
more than $14,000,000 in gold. About a year
a-nd a half ago this property passed out of
the hands of the Sierra Buttes Mining Com
l>any and became the proi>erty of the Hayes
brothers of San Jose.
Dozens of promising prcspects are lying idle
in various parts O< the county, awaiting a
time when cheaper and more convenient means
lor transportation, both for supplies and rep
resentatives of capital, wiil make them valu
able properties.
Several properties containing ore that cannot
be reduced by any local means are idle because
there is no railroad to carry the ores to a
s>melter or other reduction works. Many thou
sands of tons of such ores could be profitably
shipped from the county every year if the
means for transportation were at hand.
Among the quartz mines now being opened
in a systematic way by outside capital are
the Empire at Gold Valley, the Oriental at
Allpaihany. the Marguerite at Sierra City, the
Telegraph near Downievtlle, the Las Mat at
Gold Valley, and the Diadem at Forest City.
The coiinty is crossed by a dozen or more
limestone belts which produce excellent lime.
These lime deposits are Inexhaustible. Near
the line between Yuba and Sierra count*.:* are
â vast deposits of marble.
At Pike <*ity there is a wide belt of soap
stone, which Is used in various parts of the
county for furnace linings and other fireproof
purposes. Along this) belt talc in its purest
state can be quarried.
Near Luce's mill, in the western end of the.
county, is a fine ledge of magnesia, some of
which has been shipped to San Francisco, being
hauled t"> Marysville hy team, but the freight
charges are too heavy to make the enterprise
profitable.
Copper exists in several parts of the coun
ty, viz: at Poker Flat. Depot Hill. Sierra City
and Howard Creek. Lack of transportation fa
cilitits has prevented the lieve'opment of any
of these mlnf-a A recent report on the copper
property at Poker Fiat, made by a prominent
mining engineer, shows this to be one of the.
most valuable and extensive deposits of copper
in the known world.
Near Oold Valley Is a large deposit of py
rites, which has been prospected principally
for the gold values contained.
Basaltic blocks suitable for paving stones
are _b_itdant In several portions of the county.
TROUBLED HARRISON GUL47H.
Another decision has been given in
the Harrit-o-n Gulch townsite case by
J. H. Flmple of the General Land Of
fice of the United States. The Redding
Searchlight says that it is favorable to
the owners of the Bonanza mining
claim. The general uncertainty attend
ing the litigation between the mine
owners and the people of the town
ship is indicated by th* Searchlight in
a review of the latest proceedings sub
stantially as follows:
The townnlte case has been tried in many
shapes aid forms and in divers courts, land
offices and places. First the victory is alleged
to be with one aide and then with the other
There have been dÂ»ys of rejoicing in both
camps of the litigants. Kirst one wins every
thing in sight and declares that th* other has
no ground to i>tand upon. Then In a little
â while the other side in another court or in an
.other case or on some new trial of an old case
-.vina what it declares is an overwhelming
legal victory. This case has become tike a
gam* of shuttlecock. People who are not di
rectly interested don't understand what a de
cision In the case really decides. It has been
settled so many times, apparently, but only to
be all unsettled by tome subsequent decision
by some one else In authority. â  The decision
rendered by the Assistant Commissioner of thÂ»
General Land OKI mma to Oeciue mat tna
Bonanza Is a legal mining claim.
The new mining exchange of Los An
: geles has begun Its existence vuth by
laws based on those of the Colorado
Springs Mining Exchange. The mem
bers are divided into two classes â ex
change and associate members. ThÂ«
plan is as follows:
Triers will be nine members of the> govern
ing boards, divided into three cla*ses. so thaX
three will retire at the end of each year. The
board will have absolute power in the ma. tter
, of disciplining members, and may expel by a
' vote of seven. Stocks listed will be> divided
1 into four classes, viz. U> mines, i.Z) preferred
â¢ prospects, i^) prospects. (,4> miscellaneous. To
! be classed as a mine a property must show
' mill or smeiu- returns of not less than lIZ
000 net durui* the year previous to date at
â¢ application.
In the "p'-efem sd prospect" class will b*>
placed properties owned by partla* nn__ctally

TITLES AT GOUOFEELD.
To remedy the confusion that haÂ» Â«
isted at Goldfleld concerning- the own
ership of land the Goldfleld Townslte
Association has recommended substan
tially as follo-ws:
It is natural that people who haâ â¢ bought
lots from the townaita company should look
to them to seÂ«ure the Government tltla. not
withstanding the fact that the contracts which
they hold from that company have been care
fully and studiously drawn so as to avoid any
legal obligation on the part of the company to
do anything whatever In the way of procuring
the title patent.
Under these circumstances, and in vlÂ»w ot
1 the legal aspect of the situation as above pre-
I sented. it would seem that the proper course
I to pursue ts for all parties to unite in an ap
plication for a townaite pâtenr. _nd we con
' tend that this course would result in benefit
f> all conoerned. It would Â«ive title at a -iom-
Inal cost and in a lawful way to ail bona
fi.le occupants and purchasers of lots, rjftard
! leas of thetr affiliations or non-affiliation*
with the townsite company. It would atso
relieve the townsite company from thetr Im
plied obligation to swum titte for their nu
merous purchasers: and it would not affect or
i impair, in any manner, their title, or olalrr
I title, to the remaining lands claimed by thetr
i several mining claims.

EASTER GIFTS
ST. PETERSBURG, April 30, 3:30 a.
m. â Easter day, Russia's greatest day
of joy and peace, was ushered in with
none of the disorders and rioting that
were dreaded. As for centuries the
throngs of the Russian faithful
throughout the empire gathered at
midnight in and around the cathedrals,
churches and shrines to greet the risen
Lord and to mark the end of the Len
ten gloom and sadness of passion week
with illuminations, the pealing of bells
and shuuts of "Hallelujah, Christ is
risen: He is risen indeed!" Nothing
could better illustrate the deep devotion
of the Russian folk than the universal
participation in the midnight festival.
A decree conceding liberty of worship
to the Old Eeiievers and abolishing the
r?Hglou3 disabilities of the Roman
Catholic and other Christian communi
ties and of the Mohammedans will be
published to-day.
Emperor Nicholas' Easter gifts, in
addition to the decree on the subject of
religious freedom, consist of a series of
conscripts and ukases. One of the im
perial announcements remits the peas
ants' arrearages of taxes and back
payments on account of lands given to
them at the time of their emancipation,
amounting to about $37,500,000. Al
though no general amnesty for politi
cal offenses will be granted, pardon
will be extended to certain classes of
prisoners, including those arrested for
participation in the disturbances of
January 22.

and J. W. Skelton & Co. are named
as defendants In a suit for $250,000
damages started in the Federal Court
for the Ninth District in Nevada by
the Rocky Mountain Securities Com

of the suit is that the defendants
charged the Denver company with be
ing "wildcatters" in the Nevada min

It is alleged that on March 20, 1905.
the defendants held a meeting and de
nounced the Rocky Mountain Securities
Company as a "wild cat" company.
Law sen and Frisbee published the re
port of the meeting In their paper, the

was a "wild cat" proposition through
out.
The defendants are brokers and
newspaper men doing business in Gold

result of alleged malicious attacks in

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN, April 29.â Ellen. Key. a
Swedish author, has closed a re
markable months campaign in Berlin
and other leading German cities in ad
vocacy of her " x% ver Ethics." or mat
rimonial reform. She has been talked
about, written about and gossiped
about more than any other woman in
years. Her photographs have sprung
up magically â¢- the magazines, illus
trated papers and shop windows, and
post-card likenesses of her are hawked
about the streets as if she were a royal
personage.
Miss Key is 55 years old. Her "New
er Ethics," as far as they concern the
married state, are founded upon two
main ideas. She advocates first of all
easier divorce for men and women,
who after vowing to love, cherish and
obey, find that they drew a blank in the
matrimcmial lottery. She vvouid make
it not only possible, but absolutely
lesjal, for married couples to divorce
themselves by mere mutual agreement,
or by desire of either husband or wife.
titie considers it criminal for human
law to compel people to live together
as man and wife who do not in their
hearts cherish the fullest affection and
trust for each other. "Facilitate di
vorce" Is her remedy for much of the
world's marital uahappiness.
It was the second basic idea of her
theories that proved a genuine sen
sation In Berlin and throughout Ger
many. Miss Key says no child should
be called "illegitimate." She says that
if a man and woman care for their
child it is a legitimate child and should
not be compelled to go through life
with a stigma. She pleaded eloquently
that in the eyes of God "the children
of love" are not illegitimate and that
the world has no right to call them
such.
Miss Key believes in marriage, but
only when men and women care for
each other so thoroughly and so nat
urally that there can be no question of
future unhappine3s. But she would
not make a lawful marriage an es
sential condition. If they wish to
marry, well and good, says this Scan
dinavian nioneer. But of they prefer
BOt to enter the matrimonial state
they are not sinful If affection be
there. She says that statistics prove
that illegitimate children are the
liealthiest of all offspring, because
usually born of healthy parents and
born "in love."
Miss Kay's theories were promul
gate* before several largely attended
mass -meetings of Berlin working
classes and in some quarters there was
a movement to suppress her public ad
dreges as "pernicious." Bat the Ger
man Woman's Club espoused her
cau.se and she has continued her
"campaign of education" unmolested.
Miss Kay lives with her brother in
Stockholm and makes her living by
writing. Her mest famous work. "The
Century of the Child," has been trans
lated into almost every European
tongue. One of her theories about child
ren is to the effect that the school of
the future is to have the primary
school and kindergarten replaced by
home instruction.

Condition and Theory.
A few days a^o, at a restaurant in
this town, a young colored woman,
personally unobjectionable In every
respect, was asked â after she had been
allowed to finish her repast â not to
come again. ThyÂ» proprietor put the
case to her thus: "I am here to sell
food to well mai.nered people. You
are well mannered and your money is
just as good to me as anybody's. But
I have had complaints from my white
patrons against your eating here. If
I continue to serve you I Â»hÂ»ll los* all
my trade. If I do can I *et other
trade? It is a pure business proposi
tion. I tell it to you and ask you
what would you do in my place? "
The girl replied that she would do just
as he was doing; that he v-aa entirely
right in his request and that she would
come no more. It is a condition, not &
theory, that confronts hotel and res
taurant keepers. â Indianapolis News.
SAYS JEFFERSOX WORKED
FOR BETTERMENT OF WORLD
Chicago Rabbi Declares the Great
Actor Made the StagÂ© m
BBS Pulpit.
CHICAGO. April 29.â 1n -a gtovfiÃf
tribute to thÂ« American stage, Ife
Erail G. Hirsch has declared- that Jos
eph Jefferson was as much a conse
crated" Driest of God as any minister
in any- : faith. His pulpit was "^ ."his,
stage, and for two generations he had.
worked for the betterment of r the
world. Dr. Hlrsch's tribute came at
the close of J^ his lectura In Temple
Israel, in wh^ph he discoursed upon
"Laughter an& Those Who Make U*
Laugh."
"The man who does not laugh to de
spicable," said Dr. Hirsch. "and It la
the jealous, envious, deceitful hypo
crite that does not laugh. Those that
make us laugh fully serve their pur
pose in life, and the world is better by
far by th?!r being. The stage Is ele
vating. For two generations a (Teat
Rip Van Winkle made us laugh. He
lifted us from oares and made us see
thing* in a better light. He has pasead
away, and h4a will be the kingdom of
heaven. He was In truth a consecrated
priest of the Almighty God; his stage
was his pulpit, and when he occupied
it the theater was the temple.
"The stage presents to us life from
all Its aspects, and, therefore Its pic
torial eloquence opens our eyes to
deeper realities. The true stage will
never recognize the vil? â the pure who
enter the theater shall leave it as pure
as they were when they entered. Life
is not all in Sunday school."

English Purchases â of .Wheat.
The reports of the wheat market In
England indicate that shipments from
the United States have undergone s>
great falling off during the present
year. The cereal year in the United
Kingdom ends on August 31 of each
calendar year. We still led the world,
but were closely pressed by India and
wltfc Russia coming not far behind.
Four or five yeara ago we were selling
to the people of^the United Kin*
nearly two-thirds of their wheat, w
In the last year our sale* have dropped
to only, about one-quarter of their pur
chases. Whether this is a forecast of %
permanent change it ts probably too
*oon to decide. Certain It is, however,
that tho record of the cereal year 1904
exhibits the poorest relative showing
we have made In the English market

ter of a centuryâ Boston Herald.

Dried Fruits in NÂ«n\ YÂ«wL.
âUa.il advices from New Ycrk cay:
â¢ThÂ« Md closed with an extremely quiet
marififct for a.i varieties of California dried
iruitE, with business on the hand-to-mouth
order. The Prune situation due* not Eeem to
have been materially kCected by reports of
aerlous cuunAge to the growing crop, though
it Is understood that some nhippers who have
i-oods here on consignment nave wired their
affects not to sell until further notice. Latest
advices indicate that the Sonoma crop has been
mo6t altected, the loss being estimated at 50
per cent at least. Tee Sama Clara crop, ae
coi-dinc to advices Irom a number of sources,
will undoubtedly be short. These . reports do
cot seem to have stimulated buying interest
id spot stock to any extent, though rome sell
ers reported a pUght improvement in this re
epect. There was a little more demand for
fancy coast needed Raisins on the si>ct at
t : 4 c. but only :..a:. lots are wanted. Little
or no interest in future Apricots is shown by
either the home or e-xport tradet the disposi
tion being to hold off for lower prices, which
are confidently exi>ected should the present
promise of a large crop be fulfilled. At pres
ent sellers on the coam eeem to be unwilling:
to accept less than 64 c f. o.b. on choice Koy
ale in bags for July shipment. Limited sup
plies of spot Aprlcois and Peaches keep prices
on a steady basis, but there is little demand
for either at present. Currants on the spot
are fairly eteady, but the demand continues
light."
Washington Crop Bulletin.
ThÂ»- resort Of G. N. Salisbury, section Â«3:
r^rtor. United States '\\>auther Bureau, for
the Wasaington Crop BullHln, week ended
Apnl 25, is as follows:
The past week was an exceedingly favor
able one for the growth of all crops, and for
t_e progress of the seasonable farm work.
The temperature averaged several degrees
above the normal lor the time of year, and
there were no frosts. During the first days
of the week there wÂ«re' copious and bene
flctâl ralni. which were followed by warm
weather and sunshine that made all vegetation
trow with wonderful rapidity.
All spring work Is at a satisfactory stare. '
Pota'o planting, orchard spraying and plowing
<or - -rr.m<-r tallow have been the work for
the majority of farmer*. Early garden vege
tables and potatoes art growing well. Hops
have come up well and have a rood start:
tome have been trained to poles. Apples and
strawberries are corning into general bloom
much earlier than last year.
The condition of the staple crops of the
Btate is very satisfactory. Spring grain sow
ing In practically completed, except In the
coldest and wettest localities. Early sown
wheat and oats are growing splendidly. Win
ter wheat and barley have made very satis
factory progress and are looking fine". Corn
and beans are being planted In Kllkitat Coun
ty. The condition of alfalfa, clover and other
grasses Ie excellent. Early sown sugar beets
have sprouted ThÂ« ground has more moisture
Jr. it than usual at this time of year In the
central counties, which Is very favorable for
f the wheat crop.

CHICAGO. Apr!) 29.â Weakness was in evi
denca in tha wheat market at the outset. Ini
tial quotation on May was off %c to 2^c at
SO^c to 88c. July was down %c to \t,c to %c
at 82 7 /Â»c to B.*?ig)B3Hc. Continuation of weather
conditions was excellent for the growth ot fan
sown wheat and was the chief reason for the
sharp teeIUMS. Another bearish factor was
unexpected weakness at Liverpool, notwith
standing the strength exhibited here yester
day. Liberal movement in the Northwest wan
a further depressing influence, receipts to-day
at Minneapolis and Duluth being US cars,
f-ompartd with 90 a year ago. Offerings were j
liberal from the start, but demand was slack. '
Early in the session the selling pressure was
greatest on the May option, but later the July \
delivery monopolized the attention of traders.

MIKADO'S MEN ARE ACTIVE ON THE FIELD
BUT PROVE WEAK AT THE BAT.
Spectators With Their Cleverness
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. April 29.
thousand people saw the Stan
basebail team take the visiting
Japanese team from Waseda Univer
into camp this afternoon by the^
of nine runs to one. The dimlnu
brown men. however, covered
themselves with glory, for they played
a much better game than wae expected
Â»m. and taking into consideration
the fact that they had had only one
week . lon a strange diamond
lid remarkably well to keep the
cardinal team from rolling up a larger
They will have another chance
at the Stanford team next Monday in
San Francisco, and if they learn from
experience of to-day this game
should be a close one.
It looked at first as though the colors
of victory were going to wave over
Japan instead of the United States.
The visitors blanked the cardinals in
the first inning, and started off in the
eecond in a whirlwind fashion. Captain
Hashido walked, and went to second
on Sales* wild pitch. Then Kono, the
little pitcher, whose throwing arm is
only twenty-four inches long, stepped
up to the plate. He let the first ball go
by and then blnged the second one for
a corking sink bringing in Hashido
from second. But that was all, for the
next three men died by the first base
route. Stanford forced in three runs
on hits and errors on the part of the
Japanese, and from then on the result
was never in doubt. They scored two
more in the fourth and then gradually
ran ux> their total to nine.
The Japanese players lacked the team
â work of their American college rivals.
They went sound asleep at times, al-*
lowing the cardinal men to steal un
earned bases. They, had a tendency to
ascend whenever there were men on
bases, and it was on their wild throws
to third and first that Stanford made
many of her scores. Barring this their,
fielding was first-clans. The little Japa
nese showed a shiftiness on their feet
that surprised the home team and
brought cheers from the bleachers as
they cut off seemingly sure hits by the
cardinal. Had they been able to hit

Calif ornian Boxer Is Ex
pected to Be a One to Two
Choice Over Jabez White
NELSON IN A TBYOUT
Engages Fred Landers to Go
Six Fast Hounds With.
Him to Test His Speed
The activities of the Grand Jury will
make the Britt-White fight the lightest
betting- affair of its kind held here in
many years. There will be no open
betting, the poolsellers not caring to
incur the wrath of the authorities in
the present disturbed condition of
afrairs.
One of the best Judges of prices in
the city is of the opinion that Britt
will rule a 1 to 2 choice in whatever
wagering is done.
Britt boxed four fast rounds with
Sam Berger yesterday. Though Berger
is too large for him to show to ad
vantage, he landed some telling blows.
Britt weighed 136 pounds yesterday and
looked the part. He seems unusually
large about the shoulders, and his hit
ting power must have increased notice
ably. Willie Britt put on the gloves
with his brother and took two right
crosses to the Jaw which made him
fhink he had seen all the beauties of
Dreamland.
Battling Nelson wants a taste of the
six-round game before he goes East.
He has arranged to box six rounds at
Larkspur to-day with Fred Landers.
Neither boxer is to expect any mercy.
Friends of Rufe Turner of Stockton
have raised the $2500 side bet demanded
by Manager Nolan for a fight with
Nelson. The match has been clinched
and will probably take place here in
July.

HONITON BEATEN FOR THE HANDICAP BY GORGALETTE
Fabiola Day Draws a
Large Crowd to
the Races.
c
Mr. Skinner Takes the
Fabiola Cup on
Sweet Tooth.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
An extravagaotly well furnished card
attracted a large crowd to Oakland
track yesterday, the occasion being
Fabiola day. Complimentary badges
were not honored, and _Â£he fund of
Fabiola Hospital was swelled to the
extent of $3 778 through the generosity
of the New California Jockey Club.
The bookmakers did a big business,
and as three boiling hot choices were
dethroned the layers had a good in
ning.
P. Ryan's grand mare Honiton lost
the handicap, at one and a sixteenth
miles, starting a 9 to 5 choice, causing
intense gloom in society circles. The
daughter of Ormonde, piloted by
Knapp, made all of the running, only
to be defeated in a furious drive by
Gorga4ette, a 15 to 1 Phot, with "Wiz
ard" McÃride at the throttle. Soufriere
finished third.
ANANIAS BECOMES BECALMED.
Ananias became becalmed and as yet
has not been sighted off Point Lobos
light.
Frank Skinner, who is beyond ques
tion the most finished amateur rider in
America, captured the Fabiola cup
with Sweet Tooth, a 2 to 1 favorite.
The distaince was one mile and sev
enty yards, and his mount won farther
than any of Hank Harris 1 ball tossers
can knock one of Ham Iberg's peace
offerings. Dr. Smythe attached him
self to the middle section of the purse
by landing Sceptre in the place, four
lengths in advance of Frank Pearce.
Sad Sam, the intermittent sprinter,
was made favorite for the introductory
six-furlong Felling run. It was prob
ably overlooked that Cerro Santa had
seventeen pounds off from his previous
rare, and the latter horse scored an
easy win. Sad Sam, after a slow be
ginning, cm-led up noticeably as the
â wii â¢ irrevv near, losing the place to
Ocyrohe.

BOLD BANDITS
WORK QUICKLY
â¢pactal Dtapavtefa to Th* Call.
BAN JOSE, April 29.â Two highway
men held up two stages and a double
â¢â¢aieu carriage and robbed twenty-five
persons about 5:30 o'clock this after
noon at a place known as Sandy Point,
ebout two miles from the Lick Ob
eervjaory-
The stages, which belong to the
Mount Hamilton Stage Company,
â¢.oiling slowly up the grade. Four
of the passengers had tired of riding
end were walking ahead. As the walk
*re rounded a point in ihe road one of
the highwaymen stopped them. Just
then the first stage, with Al Jamison
driving, came up and the bandit
stopped the driver. Then, pointing his
shotgun at them, he commanded the
passengers tv alight. After the passen
gers had left the stage the driver was
told to go on. By this time the second
etatr* had arrived. Al Parron, the
driver, was stopped in the same man
ner and, after being relieved of his
passengers, was also compelled to
drive on. In the private conveyance
vert two ladies and two boys- They
were also stopped and told to alight.
The occupants of the carriages were
Quickly lined up at the side of the
road and searched. In the searching
the highwayman put his double-barrel
shotgun aside and used a revolver to
guard his prisoners. It is n<A believed
thai more than $30 in cash besides some
diamond rings and watches were se
cured. Some jewelry v-as returned.
The passengers stood the ordeal well.
#Â«<pecJaUy the ladies. 'Some comment
vac made on the nerve of the robber
In operating alone, when the man
pointed to a bluff upon the side of the
road a few yards away where a com
panion sat with a shotgun in his
hands. The stages were on their way
to Mount Hamilton and will not re
turn to this city until to-morrow morn
ing.
Among the passengers in the coaches
were: H. T. Pitkin, of San Francisco;
Mrs. F. A". Harnden and Mi?s Nora
Harden, of Alameda; Mr.- and Mrs. J.
L. Buell and Misses Edith and Ger
trude Buell, of this city; Miss Jean
Forgens, of Santa Cruz; Louis J.
Hoenig, of Lockport, N. V.; A. H.
Sharp, of Oakland, In.; E. A. Evans,
of San Francisco; Dr. G. Keil, of
Siegan, Germany; Mr. and Mrs. How
ard, Mr. and Mrs. Harden and Miss
Howard, of San Jose.
After gathering his booty together,
the highwayman who had searched
the passengers warned them to re
main iÂ»till for some time. He then
stepped into the brush at the side of
the road and whistled to his partner
who joined him. The one who did the
active work wore a mask made of
black cloth. The following description
was given of him: Thirty years old,
5 feet 9 inches tall, weight 160 pounds,
slim, bony hands, scar over left eye
near nose, slouch hat, dark gray coat,
blue overalls, heavy shoes; armed with
doyble-barrel shotgun and old re
volver.
The country is very rough where the
robbery occurred and the highwaymen
will probably make their way toward
Livermore or the San Joaquin Valley.
As soon as word of the robbery was
received Sheriff Ross and Deputy Star
bird left for the place, prepared to stay
out several days.
This is the first robbery for the
Mount Hamilton stages, which carry
thousands of passengers yearly over
the road.
A woman would rather nave a man
lie than tell the truth when he has
occasion to speak of her personal ap
pearance.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL :*O. 1905.
GOLFER HARVEY
THE CHAMPION
A. Guthrie Harvey of the San Rafael
Golf Club is the amateur champion of
the Pacific Coast Golf Association for
1905. He won the title and the gold
meaal of the association on the San
Rafael links yesterday, beating John
Lawson of the San Francisco Gorf and
Country Club 5 up and 3 to play.
The match was over thirty-six holes,
eighteen of which were played in the
morning and eighteen in the afternoon.
Lawson won the first hole, the second
was halved, Harvey taking the third
and fourth and being 1 up. At the end
of the first nine holes Harvey was 2
up, though his medal score was not as
good as that of Lawson. Harvey was 2
up on the morning's play. On the next
nine holes Harvey increased his lead
to 3 ud, and, at the thirty-second hole
was dormy 4. At the thirty-third hole
the match was over.
The winner was playing a fine game,
but owed his victory chiefly to his put
ting, which was remarkably good. A
peculiarity of the match was that
twenty-eight of the thirty-three holes
played were taken by one or other of
the contestants, only five holes being
halved. John Lawson as runner-up
wins the silver medal of the golf asso
ciation. In the five competitions that
have been held for the championship
John Lawson has been the runner-up
in three, having been second to Ernest
R. Folger in 1901 and to Walter Fair
banks in 1902.
A. G. Harvey is the holder of the
championship of Northern California,
having won it on the San Rafael course
last year. The championship trophy
of the Pacific Coast Golf Association
will be held by the San Rafael Golf
Club, from which A. G. Harvey en
tered, until the contest for the cham
pionship next year.
The course in Happy Valley is ln ex
cellent condition, though the long grass
to right and left of the fair green puh
lÃhes diced or pulled balls heavily.
Among the spectators who followed
the contestants around part of the
course were Mr. and Mrs. F. S. Strat
ton. Dr. and Mrs. F. W. Skaife, Mr.
and Mrs. George Heazelton, A. S. Lil
ley, C. E. Orr, J. J. Crooks and R. J.
Davis.
COX, THE SHOTPCTTER,
IS A RECORD BREAKER
Hurls the Metal Ball Nearly One Foot
Farther Than the Previous
Mark.
PHILADELPHIA, April 29.âMich
igan carried off the honors in the ath
letic championships at the annual
carnival of relay races and field sports
held on Franklin field to-day under
the auspices of the University of
Pennsylvania. Yale won the one and
two mile relay races, and Michigan
took the four-mile race ln an excit
ing finish.
Two records were broken, but the
new figures will not stand. In the
shot put Coe, of whom much is ex
pected during the coming year by the
followers* of athletic sports, broke the
Eastern intercollegiate record of 46
feet, held by Beck of Yale. Coe put
the shot 46 feet 11% inches. As it
v/as not done during the intercollegi
ate championship meet his figures will
not stand. In the discus throw Gar
retts of Michigan sent the discus 135
feet and one-half inch, breaking the
world's record of 133 feet 6^4 inches.
His figures were not allowed because
of the construction of the discus which
was used. The attendance was 6000.

the basket ball team from the Uni

the score of 10 goals to 8. Last week

provement over their work In the for
