There 'is vÂ«very reason -to "believe.
Judging from â¢ the official ; expressions
persistently/ given out -by "the -Foreign
Ofllce since- the beginning of the nego
tiations \u25a0at Portsmouth, that this prop
osition by. Japan ; to .waive the ' question
of indemnity goes ' far toward : remov
ing the " last - and, acgording â¢to official
explanations, the only . stumbling bloc Js
in tha way of peace.
; ' The . Foreign ; Office \u25a0-; has said that
every disputed point between Russia
arid: Japan, .with the .exception of pay
ment of indemnity, had practically been
arranged on a* basis satisfactory to
both didea. but that Ru33la would never
pay. an indemnity. If the ; latest pro
posals of /Japan* mean \ that : she waive*
all claims to indemnity of any kind or
description, giving up all idea of re
imbursement for - the expe nses of the
war \u25a0in r, any : guise^ whatever. . and In
place thereof . is prepared to accept : for
the restoration - to Russia' of . the nor th
em.' < half \u25a0of : Sagballen '. a \u25a0\u25a0> redemption
price, to be fixed by : an - unbiased com-.
mission; this .price: to "be determined
upon the actual value of -the, lsland and
not to take â¢ Into ', account .Â» Japan's war
expenses or., to carry "a concealed in
demnity/ to ' Japan, .there lis \u25a0 reason : for,
the : assertion ' that â¢In all >; probability ,

here In this way and for the deduction.

ALBANT, N. V., Aug. 28.â Evidence
as to the identity of Mr. arid Mrs. John
W. I llogers, who registered from San
Francisco and who, went but *of the
Hotel Ten Eyck here Friday night,
leaving their two little boysâ <me a
baby of ' six months and the other- 6
years old â in / the care of a chamber
maid, is . steadily accumulating, but'
their - whereabouts is as much, a mys
tery as ever..
The belief that the Rogerses went to
New York Thursday and sailed on the
Campania for Europe was disposed of
this afternoon when Edwin H.- Low.
a steamship agent" with whom they had
had some correspondence about booking
passage, telegraphed that nobody, an
swering to their description had sailed
on the Campanifi or any. of the; other
liners; that departed on Saturday. The
j police are" now working on a theory
j that' Rogers and his wife are still\ in
j Alban y*Â«r near at hand." \u25a0 There' is noth-
J ing to show why they, should wish to*
abandon; their children deliberately.' On^
the . contrarjViletters.i. ; found 'in .--.; their,

'One, of , .theaewletters, - evlden tl jr.;
ished by Mm.-TÂ£og~ers.-'was written 'tori
the child to his mother by some grown*
person. In It Rex sends .."loads of
kisses." To-day" when one. of the sym
pathetic, housekeepers- wanted to kiss
Rex he declined. V "I never ' kiss any T
body but my, mamma," he explained.

Orphans' Home, while the baby .went
to St., Margaret's- Home forgery. Young
Children. The older boy shed . his first
tear* wji'en he found his brother was
to be takeir from him %
j Advices from -'Washington' confirm the
I belief drawn fromHhe papers Rogers left
j in his room that he was, vice president bf
I the Congressional Correspondence Club.
!He remained in that' position, for two
month's, when, it is said, he had a'disa
greement with his partner and left. . the
city. Charles H. Coleman 'of the New
York law firm of Quigg. Bostwick&Cole
man while here to-day said -that about a
month, ago his firm employed Rogers ; as
an expert stenographer. \u25a0\u25a0'- He left their,
employment about one week, ago.'- * -
' CHECK IS PAID. ,
The certified check for $23 which the ho
tel people cashed for. Rogers on the after-^
noon before his. disappearance .has been
paid by the Consolidated National Bank
'of New York. \u25a0 Thus far nothing â¢has; de-,
I velored to. indicate that the Rogeres are
I fleeing, from justice. One theory upon'
} which the police" are, working is that," per
haps, finding themselves without means,'
they have committed suicide.
- BAKERSFIEXJD, - Cal., -Aug. 28.âNoth
ing Is known in this city of the Identity
of John W.* Rogers, the man who desert

is practically certain- that no person bear

A graphic description of the Hawaiian
Islands. and life there was given the
Presbyterian ministers yesterday at their
meeting at 920 Sacramento street by the
Rev. F. L. Xash. D. D.
He said the angels revolted unsolicited,
while man was tempted by Intelligence
greater than his ownâ lndeed, by the
same fallen angels.
He said that the old question as '"to
who made the* devil 7" was, eliminated
from the p.uerleÃ of to-day. He held
that It was*, a. Question whether there
could be any virtue In right if the possi
bility of wrong were stricken out.
The first expression of evil, he said,
was in' heaven, where the angels set
themselves \u25a0 In rebellion against God.
Thus, "said Mr. Becks, they became the
first exponents of sin and became
demons, or devils.
The secretaries . of the delegates from
the various \ States who attended the
Christian' church convention^ln San Fran
cisco which- terminated last week have
written to. the executive committee here
expressing their appreciation for the ex
ceptionally complete arrangements made
for their reception. At a meeting of the
executive committee yesterday morning
at the Young Men's Christian Association
building, highly complimentary l et "
ters .were read by the chairman, the Rev.
Walter M: AVhite.
The. letters:. also expressed warm ac
knowledgment'of. the generosity and so
cial hospitality | which had been shown
'the large body -of "delegates by San Fran-
Ciaco's .citizens. â -ji .' v -
The members of the various committees
In .their reports- told, of t the unqualifled
success which had -attended every de
partment.during the conventions
' "Sin, :' lts .Guilt, and "Remedy" was the.
subject of an address by^ the Rev. Horace
E. Becks of Napa before the- Methodist
ministers' meeting at the Central Metho
dist ; Episcopal Mission street,
yesterday. . Rev. Mr. Becks declared that
there may be moral purposes In things
that are evil and that : evil Is frequently
needed to correct' worse evils. He gave
slavery as 'an example, saying that "It
was wiped out.by war and 'war Is hell.' "
Imperial despotism he could see tottering
to its downfall by a scourge of war.
The tendency, of much modern thought,
he held, sought to minify evil, but In
communities where' the standards were
lowered expressions of lawlessness were
in awful evidence, he feared.
The remedy, said Mr. Becks, had to
do directly with, two factors â the free will
of man and the infinite power of Jesus
Christ. .

It will contain much new material on
such subjects as "Spontaneous Genera

Life" . and others intimately connected
with the author's life work and the re
sults he has so far achieved.
It was while experimenting at the
Cavendish laboratory. Cambridge to de

bouillon j that , Mr. Burke recently found
he could secure the apparently sponta

bacteria, but which, however, were nelth

Mr. Burke matriculated at Trinity Col

subsequently obtained first-class honors
in mathematics and experimental science,

WOOSTER. Ohio. Aug. 28.â This was
Jirs. Xaggarfs day in the famous di
vorce case and she made an excellent
witness for herself, her answers carry
ing a conviction of truth to the minds
of the majority of those in the court
room.
The day opened with a controversy
between the attorneys over a letter
from the War Department. After many
objections the letter was read. It was
from General Corbiu and regretted the
report of Taggart's conduct made by
General Miner. Corbln directed that
Tagprart should be admonished for his
conduct; that a strict watch be kept to
prevent his breaking the pledge he had
signed and that a monthly report of
his conduct be made to the department.
When Mrs. Taggart was called to thÂ«
stand she gave her age as 35- years
and said thiit she joined the Episcopal
church in ISS9 at Sandusky, Ohio, where
* he. was visiting. Mrs. Taggart told of
the birth of their four children, of
whom two died In infancy. The birth
of her first child left her with an ail
ment which caused her some '.concern
at different times. This was gone into
in some detail for the purpose -of re
butting evidence offered by the plain
tiff ac to the cause of her confinement
in Christ's Hospital. The testimony of
Mrs. Taggaxt follows in part:
At the time '"riddles" was 6 years old, by
request of my husband. I joined him at Ma
ecn. Ga., leaving "TiddJes" at Fort Thomas,
ir. care of the surgeon's wife.
TfcÂ« captain told me always to be particular
to set out drinks to visitors when they called.
OnÂ« r.lght. shortly after the birth of Culver,
the captain c&xne borne drunk.
Counsel â Relate the events of the drinking
ir. the cafe at Mstar.zas, Cuba-
There was company at our house that even
ir.p. and after nioet of them had gone LJeu
tenant Bencard. Lieutenant Parker. Mrs. Saf
ferons and mys*lf, en Invitation of one of
the officers, went to & cafe for sandwiches
and lemonade. Captain Taggart said he was
tired and would not go, but we should ?_o and
bring him r sandwich. We went. The officers
took gin rlckejs and we took lemonade. One
cf the officers then paid a bill he owed and the
proprietor gave him a bottle of champagn*. I
was just about to taste my glass when In
walked the captain and 6aid to Mrs. Safferons.
"This is a nice time of night for you ladles
to be out."
I raised my glass to taste It. when the cap
tain knocked It out of my hand and I went
home with him. There ia no truth la ths tes
timony that we picked up these officers on the
etreet. They were old acquaintances.
The witness then told of their .resi
dence at Camp Meade. Pa., and at San
Francisco.
Counsel â Describe what took place on your
(stammlac expedition through Chinatown with
the captain.
We had cislted several places of Interest,
when the guide called the captain to one side
eni told him of something to be seen that
would cost $2 extra. The captain gave him
two silver dollars and we went up stairs to a
room. Tv-fcere we found a Cslnesa woman, who
disrobed before us
The witness then told of having re
turned to Fort Thomas after the cap
tain sailed, and. In the latter part of
November, IS9B, of having gone to Orr
vllle. where she lived with Taggart's
parents until March, when she went to
the Hurd Hotel for a few weeks and
then rented a house of her own.
Counsel â How did you come to go to a dance
one night with "Billy?"
Father Taggart was old and not able to go
out, so I went to the grocery and asked "'Billy"
:o call --t the house that night, and. If I felt
like going to the <lar.ee. I wanted him to taka
tut. "Eil'.y" could not dance, but he took me
and brought me home.
Wliat took place in the house after you re
turned home?
We had a little lunch, and then "Billy" left.
What object t-ad you In conversing in whls- ;
No object that I know of. except to avoid
awakening the 013 folks.
What. If anything, improper, took place be
tween you and ""BiUy" that night?
Nothing, whatever.
The story was then transferred to
â¢ Manila and Mrs. Taggart told of ac
quaintances made there, among whom
were Major Xewberry and Captain
Bash. Once she and Taggart went to
attend a meeting of officers, but on
finding no ladies present Mrs. TaggaK
stated her desire to return home, and
Bash offered to drive her home, which
he did. She to!d of a wordy battle be
tween Taggart and Bash and of how,
after entering the house. Taggart ac
cused her of having humiliated him be
fore a Junior officer and slapped her.
js there any truth -In the deposition of Au
gutelna Cc la Cruz accusing you and Captain
Bash?
No. elr. There is no truth In It.
How was the captain's treatment of ths
children'? Did he caress and fondle them
much?
He always took a great interest In their
welfare. He was very proud of them, but
was oever demonstrative.

be of the utmost value, both to." Santa

have appropriated $1500 -for the structure,
the citizens of Palo Alto have subscribed
an'equal sum and it Is practically assured
that San Jlateo will supply at least $1500.
Of this sum property owners are expected
to advance $500 and ' the County - Super

In keeping with this improvement, it la

At any rate, Mrs. Seifert declares- she
did not. know that any money was being
saved out. of the business. She believed
there would be practically nothing . for
her to get along: with.' But the uncover
ing of her husband's secret hoard has put
a very much brighter aspect on life for
the widow and mother with three young
children to rear and educate.
: OAKLAND; Aug.- 28. --Out of nooks and
crannies, from most unexpected*/ hiding
places Mrs. Frank Seifert I has ' come | into
possession of a" fortune of $40,000, that she
had no idea existed.. Two .weeks ago her
hUEband, a butcher, died; from injuries
sustained in being kicked by a fractious
colt. Seifert had ke-pt secret his accumu
lations, and it was not until -Mrs. Seifert
went rummaging through the home, at
2259 Peralta street, that she- came across
the hidden treasure. -. â¢ ; \u25a0
The widow" and her three children have
become possessed of what seems to the
bereaved* wife to be a great fortune. A
short time before her husband's urftimely
death, he sold out-' a half-interest in his
butcher shop, which netted him a few
hundred dollars. When Mrs. Seifert be
gan to settle her husband's affairs she
was convinced that less than $1000 would
represent all of his estate. /i .
But now all is changed. : Seifert had
notes, mortgages and bank books stowed
away about the house which represent a
hoard that Mrs. Seifert thinks may run
into $40,000. She cannot account -for the
large and unexpected amount that has
Leen brought to light. She admits she
knew ; little concerning " her .husband's
business accounts. It has been intimated
that Seifert, who took a great Interest in
horses, may have won heavily at the
races last season. . ; '

LOS ANGELES, Aug. 28.â Lawrence
Hanleyv once, one of the most noted
actors" on the American Stage and ., Who
at one time had a f uture, " which ; in
promts* 'was second to none in* his pro
fession, died this evening at the County
Hospital, : where he was practically a
.charity patient. Drink, morphine and
dissipation rendered him an : easy '.vic
tim of tuberculosis and for more than
a'year jt had been known that the end
â¢was rapidly approaching. J \u25a0â¢ ' .
. That he lived so long wasÂ» a matter
of- surprise to those who knew, the pace
which Hanley c went as long as he v was
able to keep on his feet. A Iconflrmed
dope fiend, possessed of' a" thfrsV for
liquor .which was amazing, *he went to
extremes whenever, he had the- nioney
with which to satisfy his 'â¢'cravings.
Several times he had been arrested as a
common drunk andÂ°not*fpr more, than
a. year had he occupied anything like
the plane of respectability ".to which
his genius entitled him. * ....:;
The closing" hours* of his life were
marked hy an Incident of unusual path
os. Ten years ago, Hanley mafrled
Edith Lammert, jan actress'^'of .ability.
A daughter, was born, to them' and for
two years they lived .together. '.-^Then
the wife discovered that her husband
drank to excess and was guilty .of
other " things more" serious=- to* a*, wife,
than even drunkenness. He attacked
her : murderously: one night 'ln'. Cincln
nati and she left him and until Sunday
had not seen .him again. . She chanced
to' be" in Los Angeles* and on ,Sunday
she received word that, Hanley was
dying, and in his. delirium was calling
for her. Forgiving 'a\l the wrongs he
had done, her, she went to his bedside
and, taking his wasted body in her
arms, tried to make him know that
despite the lapse of years she stHl
loved him. Les.s than* twenty-four
hours later' he died a.nd his last words
were a blesing upon the woman he had
so greatly. wronged. .:; \u25a0< â¢

SEATTLE, Aug. 23.â Murdered for their
money and cremated In the building
where they lived to hide the evidences of
the c*me was the fate of Phillip H. Ross
and his wife. a. young couple who have
been living near Kerrystown, a small
town on the Northern Pacific Railway
near Kanasket.
Last March Ros3 and his wife located
about two miles from the town of Kerrys
town and Ross opened a saloon, living
with his wife above the saloon building.
All of the people living in that locality
have been inVthe habit of having their
checks cashed by Ross and he always
kept a considerable sum of money in
the saloon lor that purpose.
To-day A. S. Kerry of the Kerry Lum
ber Company had occasion to go out to
the Ross house, and when he arrived
found the building in ruins and the
charred remains of the young couple in
the debris. Deputy Coroner Wilts went
out late this afternoon to make the In
vestigation. Dr. Wiltz stated to-night his
belief that Ross and his wife had been
murdered for their money by parties un
known and the bodies burned for the pur
pose of hiding the crime. The remains
were so charred that it was almost im
possible to ascertain whether there were
any marks of violence.
From a mere financial enterprise !n
which American and Belgium stock
holders were Interested, the surrender
of this concession has become the key
stone of the political policy of China,
on it depends not only the role Amer
ica Is to play In the commercial de
velopment of the Far East, but the lim
itations of Japan's influence In Peking
when the present war has been brought
to an end. BeMnd it is now clearly
teen the hand of Japan. There is little
doubt that Japan was behind China In
her original offer to buy the Hankow
concession. Japan Is anxious, to ob
tain control of the Southern Chinese
railways as Russia did In Manchuria.
When President Roosevelt took de
cisive steps to protect the Interests in
volved In the sale of the -railway,
China, through her Minister, Sir Cheng
Liang Chang, offered a compromise,
suggesting- joint control of the finished
railway by China, Japan and the Unit
ed States, the last named furnishing
the capital. This proposition has not
been accepted, but. the negotiations are
*=till pending. This plan, however, has
become known in Russia and has ex
cited indignation.
It Is unfortunate that while Presi
dent Roosevelt Is acting as mediator
between Russia and Japan the United
States should be placed In the light of
making secret deals for Chinese con
cessions -w-ith a victorious belligerent.
Yet this impression has been freely cir
culated in official In , Russia.
The President has been informed
through Embassador Meyer "of the at
titude of Russians, which was recently
verified by the Novoe Vremya. *
Such a plan places: America in th*
position of being In, a commercial al
liance with the power that has become
j>rrdominaat in China. â¢ From a Rus
sian point of view it, gives a most
sdflsh look to President Roosevelt's
earnest and impartial efforts, for peace.

upon the imprisoned men and' cooked
some of them to death.
Engineer Lucas met death In a most
horrible form, his body being cut Into
four pieces.
A special train was rushed to. the
scene of the wreck with physicians
from Willlts. and the injured men were
removed to the company's hospital at

Women suffering from any form of
female weakness are in vi ted to promptly
communicate with Mrs. Pinkham, at
Lynn. Mass. All letters are^ received,
opened, read and answered by women
onlyl A. woman can freely talk of her
private illness' to a woman; thus 'has
been established the eternal confidence
between Mrs. Pinkham and the women
of America which has '; never been
broken. Out of the vast volume of
experience which she has to draw from,
it is more than possible that she has
g-ained the very knowledge that will
â¢,clp your ca&e. She asks nothing, in
return except your good-will/andher
advice has relieved thousands.; Surely
any woman, rich or poor., is very foolish
if she does not take, advantage of this
: generous offer of assistance. . *

after his eight-mile road work, Bat
tling and his satellites entered
the bath \u25a0 house at Escalles. The party
discarded S their sweat-damp clothing and
emerged clad in bathing suits. -The water
felt 'good to them . arid the sturdy little
Dane enjoyed it immensely. Twelve mln
nutes,from the time he entered the water
he was. lying on the slab receiving, a
good rubbing. Then he sauntered leis
urely homeward, where jan \u25a0 inviting meal
was awaiting him in his cottage.
Bat did Justice to the meal, thoroughly
masticating all his food and joshing Billy
Nolan about his prepossessing high'fore
head. He allowed " his muscles to relax
for a short time and then read the papers.
He has added another well-known athlete
to ; his camp in the person -: of George
Braun, the champion; amateur. welter and
middle weight \ -wrestler ; of ,; the Pacific
Coast, j who will spar and wrestle with

Hanthnrnp Club Preaenta a Likely
Loo Kins Amateur Card at Wood-
Trard's This Evening.
When Tom Sullivan and Bob Lundie
hook up this evening at Woodward's
Pavilion in the main event of the Haw
thorne Club's amateur 6how the 'fight
fans will witness one of the fastest"
mlllr. 6een here for many a moon. The
rival boxers are about the best in their
class around these parts and plenty of
lively going should be crowded into
those four rounds.
Another likely looking bout on the
card Is the one scheduled between Pete
Sullivan and Jack Rodney. The latter
has met and defeated the bes^boys in
his class during the last few 'months
and if he manages to stow Sullivan
away he will be regarded as a real
comer. Willie Wolff's opponent is yet
to be named.. Ho was originally carded
to box Bill Christie, but as the latter
turned professional Friday night he
will not be allowed to appear. Four
other likely looking fights are on the
.programme.
Far west as he can possibly get and
Btill reside on terra firma,; Jimmy Britt In
training at Sheehan's ocean beach villa
for his coming bout with Battling Nel
son.can find no surcease from worry and
trouble. Probably if Jimmy could lock
himself up in a burglar-proof safe and
have the safe deposited, on some barren
island in the Salton sea," he would do so.
That is, providing he could condition him
self for the approaching battle with the
corrugated iron Swede from. Hegewlch by
the move. For three nights, Britt said
yesterday, he dreamed of diminutive
referees perched on air four poets of his
sleeping couch, tossing back and forth a
medicine ball weighing one ton. Per
chance it-should be dropped, Jimmy dur
ing this dreamland extravaganza kept
rolling and tossing; which, of course, was
not conducive to refreshing J rest. Now,"
however; that the third man In the ring
has been selected his troubles are reduced
by one. Then, said Jimmy, they: call me
up on the telephone at all hours' of the
night, asking j what I thought the betting
ought to be and in which round -did: I ex
pect to hear ten counted off. on- Nelson.
Why, just this morning, continued Britt.
a "ripe" one" blew out here at 6 o'clock
whom I never recollect having seen be
fore and wanted to put.; on the gloves
with me. .Then again, Jimmy says, thirty
or 'forty visitors to the beach every day
query him as to what kind ; of a fight he
is going to put up. He sends them home
happy with the information, "One that
will bring home the dough.'-'
For about fifteen minutes : Scotty. gave
James Edward a hard rub for first place
honors | at . Sheehan's. :.. . The \u25a0:. mysterious
miner from Death Valley invited some
friends up to the: bar. ordered; twenty
three cases of wine placed In J the re
frigerator ! with the corks turned : toward
the south, purchased a- hundred thousand
Colorado-Maduro Perf ectos, tossed a peck
or two of nuggets . to an admiring; group
of small boys,' then: returned to ; town in
his automobile. These Ismail things all
help Scotty in establishing his 1 financial
footing, . for. one bystander informed I hia
friend that the Death Valley miner had
$17,000,000 in coin. This, Is -the first esti
mate of his wealth to appear In print.,

RETIRED HEAVY-WEIGHT CHAM
PION OF WORLD. WHO WILL
REFEREE BRITT-NELSON GO.
The selection of Jeffries, therefore,
should give perfect, satisfaction to the
two fighters, as well to the general pub
lic, but now another question arises. Will
he take the job? Jeff is a very peculiar
man in many ways, and should he take It
into his head to decline the job all the
persuasion in the world will not make
him change his mind. However, Manager
Coffroth will communicate with the big
fellow bright and early this morning, and
by to-night it will be definitely known
whether or not he will accept the billet.
In the event 'that Jeff refuses it looks
as If. the fight will go by the board, for
then there will be no other man in the
world that Nolan and Britt can possibly
agree upon.. During the last three days
they have practically exhausted the vis
ible supply of referees, and not one of
them would suit both parties.
the fighters In the clinches. He will let
them fight till they drop from exhaustion,
just as long as they are going under the
clean break and fighting straight Mar
quis of Queensberry rules. This will cer
tainly suit Nelson, for in his former figat
with Britt he raised the cry that Billy
Roche did not give him an even break In
the clinches.

COLORS OF ROBERT LEROY
Blarveloiin Little California .Player
.Takes Flrnt Game and Nearly.'
Captures the Set.
CINCINNATI, Aug. 28â The surprise
of the tennis tournament came this
afternoon when Miss May Button,
champion woman tennis player of Eng
land and A merlca. defeated Robert : Le
roy In one, set and almost defeated him
in a second. Leroy is intercollegiate
champion, New York champion and
world's champion at indoor tennl*. The
same, however, was not on the. regular
schedule, being entirely an exhibition
affair. In the first set Miss Sutton was
given a handicap and defeated Leroy,
6-1, but In the second, playing. without
a handicap, she was defeated, 6-4.
This idea was conceived by Nolan on
Sunday night, but at that time Britt
would not agree to It. When no decision
could be reached early last evening Nolan
again suggested the coin, but Britt again
balked. It was, therefore, a big surprise
when he did decide to take a chance and
tuss with Nolan.
It must be said to Nolan's credit that
he took a gambler's chance and lost. He
was game to the core, and when Jeffries
was chosen he accepted the big fellow
with the best grace in the world. Had
he won the choice he would have picked
George Slier, but that selection would
hardly suit the general public as well as
the great ex-champion.
It looks as If Nelson will have as even
a break as he ever enjoyed in his life,
with Jeffries as the third man in the
ring. The big fellow Is a fighter who
knows naught else. He has a great head
and a keen eye. and if, perchance, the
fight does go the limit no man in the
tvorld is better able to decide it on its
merits than he.
Then again. Jeff will not interfere with
Then another long and tedious deadlock
ensued. Nolan and Britt argued and
j ared uo at each other for nearly an
hour. Nolan contended that as long as
the FportmS writers bad selected Graney
be should be the man to act, and wanted
the decision to be final. He argued that
he had taken the chance and that Britt
should stand by his guns.
But Briit would not consent to Graney
under any circumstances. He insisted
that the commfttee had misunderstood
him and said he would let the fight go by
the wayside. The men argued and plead
ed and foamed at the mouth in a vain at
tempt to settle their differences, and It
looked as If* the match would surely be
called off when the flip of the coin was
linally suggested. *
A delegation, consisting of five sporting
writers, was appointed to pick a referee
for the light when it seemed certain the
rival managers cou!d not come to an
agreement. They deliberated but a short
time and came back with Eddie Graney
*s their choice. Willie Britt objected
strenuously, stating he had reasons for
opposing Graney and would not stand for
him.
James J. Jeffries, king of all prize
fighters, will have a chance to referee
one of the greatest ring battles In his
tory at Colma on September 9, for last
night he was chosen to be the third
man in the arena when Britt and Nel
(on clash. The deliberation was reached
only after the most stormy kind of a
cession and was the result of a toss of
tiie coin in which the luck of Willie
Britt triumphed.
It looked as if the mucb heralded
Cgrlit would have to be declared off for
\u25a0\v;int of a referee. Manager Coffroth
was at his wit's ends for a way out of
the difficulty and gloom overspread the
room when as a last resort It was sug
gested that "Willie Britt and Billy No
lan toss a coin to determine who should
judge the ereat battle. Jeffries was the
foremost choice of Britt, while Nolan
liked George Siler of Chicago.
Seeing no other way by which the
tangle could possibly be straightened
out the rival managers finally consent
ed to take a gambler's chance. Man
ager Coffroth was appointed to toss the
coin. Britt yelled "heads" and heads it
was. The strain was relieved when he
announced Jeffries was his choice.
Possibly never in the history of the
game of fisticuffs in this city or any
other city in the wide world has so
much difficulty been experienced In the
choice of a referee. The rival man
agers had been deadlocked for three
nights running and the chance of their
agreeing on any one man began to be
lessened as the minutes flew rapidly
by. But now that they have selected
Jeff It is a guarantee that the fight
will be fought Ftrictly on its merits and
that the best man will win. for Jeffs
reputation sureiy guarantees all these
thins*.
The chotee will come as a huge surprise
to the sportlnp world in general. Most of
the wise ones floored t-ddle Graney would
eventually land the plum, and he would
have had that honor but for "Willie Biitt's
etrenuous objections. The latter, driven
to desperation, at last declared he wou.ld
take any other referee in the wide world
outside of Graney when it came to a
committee trÂ» decide.

BAD BLOOD
WYTTES DISEASE
-The, blood supplies nourishment and
strength to every part of the body whea
it is nch, pure ana healthy. Whea front
anycause it becomes diseased or weak it
cannot \ supply the nutriment the system
needs, and the body is unable to resist tho
diseases and troubles that are constantly
assailing it to break down the health.
I have used 8. 8. 8. and found it to bÂ«
an excellent blood purifier and tonio.
My blood was weak and impure, and as
a result my system became very much
run down and debilitated. I lost twenty
or more pounds in weigrht, had no appe-
tite and was inbad shape. Seeing S. S. 3.
advertised I began its use, and am well
pleased with the results alter using- it
for some little while. My system and
general health have been wonderfully 1
built up, and I no not hesitate to giv*
8. Â». S. tho credit for it. H. MARTIN, a >

A rab^gram received at the Merchants'
Exchan^-e yesterday from Lloyd's, Lon
don, eonflnaed the reported capture by
the Japanese of the bark Antiope and the
Ktearr.fr Montara. They are both well
known at this port, from where they
started the voyages that have ended in
thf vessels' seizure.
The Antiope was seized August 13 at
Fajrhal:en. for v.-hich port she left here
t\::!i a. cargo of salt. She is owned by
Alexander & Baldwin and was under
rharter to the Barneson-Hibberd Com
pany. She was built in 1566 at Glasgow
and Is a vessel of 11S6 tons register.
The Montara. formerly the Willamette,
belonged to the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company. She was on the peaceful mis
sion of taking supplies to a number of
Russian fur-trading stations and was to
have brought home furs. Before the war
this work was all done from Yokohama,
6O the Japanese knew Just about what
to look for. The Montara made one
round trip and brought back a very
valuab'e cargo of costly furs. She was
captured August Iff at Nikolski.
The Montara was built in 18S1 by J.
Roach & Son at Chester, Pa. She Is a
vessel of 2362 tons register. Her com
mander is Captain T. Reilly. On this
coast she was used exclusively for
freight.

NEW ORLEANS, Aug. 28.â Report to 6
p.' m. : New cases,' 45; total to date 1788.
Deaths, 5; total, 260. New foci, 18; total,
420. Remaining under treatment, IS2.
Though New Orleans Is now in the
midst : of ; a period usually critical In
yellow fever epidemics, there Is' no pres
ent indication that the Federal authori
ties are to lose their grip on the situa
tion." '. Monday always shows an increase
over Sunday in the number of new cases,
because Sunday Is a good deal of : a
holiday for the Inspecting force, and only
the doctors are to be depended upon,
but to-day's total was regarded as con
firming the opinions expressed a week
ago .that there is little further chance
that the disease will get away from
those who are 1 fighting It bo . stubbornly.
The weather this' morning was unseason
ably cool, following a hot spell on Sun
day, 'but ( 'lt was not followed by heavy
mortality.
Unusual ; Interest attaches to the de
velopments :In connection with the dis
covery of fever ; at Gulf Port. Governor
Vardaman some time ago issued a procla
mation in which he announced that there
would * be ' proceedings against doctors In
Mississippi who suppressed the existence
of yellow fever there^ The case of Mrs.
Collins, which resulted in the acknowl
edgment by Gulf Port of infection there,
is taken to" indicate that, yellow fever
was present at Gulf j Port some weeks
ago. Mrs. Collins j reached here from
Gulf Port last Monday evening. She was
taken 111 on the train on her way over.
Dr. Lebouef, president of the New Or
leans Medical Society, was called on
Tuesday and saw at once that Mrs. Col
lins was suffering with yellow fever. :
Mrs. Collins expressed surprise when
she "was told that she had yellow fever.
She said she had lived in a house about
a mile '\u25a0 from the railroad station, close
to a house in which two young men had
been sick just fourteen days previous to
her * attack. . She said that for several
days she had noticed four or five doctors
visiting the house, leading her to believe
that a consultation was In progress. Sub
sequently it , was announced that the^slck
ness was malaria. *
Dr. "Wasdln was ordered to investigate.
The result was the turning up of three
cases of : yellow fever in the* territory In
which Mrs. 1 Collins lived. ,As a result
of . the discovery of the cases at Gulf
Port and Mississippi City, numbers of
doctors here who have patients on the
Mississippi coast are/ now advising their
return to the city, where,- in the event of
illness, they may be sure of perfect
treatment. '

General McCaskey AlsoÃec
ommends Additional Pay
in Army for Marksmanship
MAKES AMUAL EEPORT
Commander of Department of
Colorado Submits Sugges
tions to Improve Service
WASHINGTON. Augr. 28.â 1n his an
nual report for the Department of Colo
rado which . has just been received, at
the War Department. Brigadier Gener
al: William S. McCaskey, commanding,
recommends among other things the
re-establishment of the canteen feature
of the' post exchanges and also addi
tional pay for marksmanship.
General McCaskey states that during
the â¢ past year strong effort ha? been
made to stop the sale and Improper dis
position of military clothing by enlist
ed men and that trials befors United
States courts of. civilians charged -with
buying arms, ammunition and clothing
from soldiers have not resulted in con
victions. He makes â¢ the recommenda
tion that uniform clothing should be
so marked that no question could arise
as to its issue by the Government and
upon. the discharge of the soldier, or if
for any other, cause he become separat
ed from the service, the clothing be
purchased by the Government and de
stroyed.
In view of the fact that large bodies
of troops ! are constantly traveling to
and from the Pacific Coast, General Mc-
Caskey " recommends that a standard
kitchen car for a command not less In
size, than a battalion should be adopted,
so as to enable the troops to be sub
sisted on' the regular or garrison ra
tion . and with much greater comfort
and convenience than at present.
The following recommendations as
to athletics are concurred in by Gen
eral McCaskey: - â¢ ,
4 That j there be j three post field days during
the year, one each in March. June and Sep
tember, instead of the monthly field days now
prescribed.
That, annual division or department athletic
meets be held during October of each year.
- That during- the session the different post
baseball teams be allowed to visit . at other
posts in the department at Government ex
pense. '..-\u25a0"\u25a0

Labor day is a legal holiday in all the

observed only in Orleans parish. Labor
day was inaugurated by the Knights of
Labor by a parade In New York City
in 1882 for the purpose of showing the
strength of united labor. After the pa
rade in 1884 it was resolved to set aside
one day In the year as Labor day and
each State was urged to make Labor
day a legal holiday. The first Legisla
ture to do so was that of Colorado in
1887. '//':" :

two chief branches. The, first treats of
equations Involving ' unknown quantities
having a determinate value; In the other,
called - the : diopahantine *or Intermediate

JAPAN'S PURPOSE.
THROUGH all of the complications incident to the peace nego
tiations at Portsmouth one thing is plain. Japan desires peace
on such conditions as will be an insurance against future Rus
sian aggressions and future war. The world will respect this atti
tude. The world, meaning that part not involved in dynastic am
bitions, more and more wants peace. This is shown remarkably by
the dying out of that spirit which craved war for any cause or no
cause. It was honorably -testified to by Edward of England when
he refrained from war over the Dogger Bank affair, with the ac
quiescence of his people. â¢
Fifty years ago the firing on the British fishermen would have
caused a declaration of war within twenty-four hours. ' The people
would have forced it. But the people want peace. They are tired
of war, its slaughter and its burden of debt. The same is true in
the United States, and is growing to be true all over the world.
Therefore, the nation unfortunately at war which insists upon con
ditions of peace that shall make tranquillity permanent has a claim
on human sympathy and respect.
On the other side Russia talks "about saving her face" as a
reason for continuing to get whipped. Ben Franklin said there was
never a good war. nor a bad peace. When Russia refuses the well
meant efforts of Prcsldent-JRoosevelt to end the struggle on the
ground that Linevitch promises to .win a victory in battle, she is as
far outside the world's sympathy as Japan is within it. \
We notice that in continental Europe the lapse in the negotia
tions is taken advantage of to renew talk about, the yellow peril,
and much sympathy is expressed for the United States, irv view iof
what Japan may do to us. This country has .whipped every 'country]
in Europe that offered to try conclusions in battle with us, and is not
likely to be scared by phantoms. As far as Asiatic trade goes, it
will be under the same natural laws that govern trade anywhere and
everywhere, and the United States will stand on the same footing as
Japan and the rest of the world. ;

THE BLISS THAT YOU MISS.
rpHE Zionist movement, for restoration of Jewish nationality, and
the creation of a distinct state composed of that people, which
1 is to take its place among the nations of the world, is interesting
not only for the novelty of the proposition, but for other reasons.
The Jews in Europe were for centuries treated not only with
conspicuous inequality, but with equally conspicuous crilelty. What
we have seen in recent years in Russia was once the rule in conti
nental Europe. Then, as now, it had its origin in religious bigotry
and in the grosser superstitions which have impinged upon the
Christian religion. It must not be inferred, however, that Christian
ity is the only form of the religious idea that has been adumbrated
by superstition. In its. case the only wonder is that such impinge
ment was possible, since the whole system arose in a protest against
superstition. But, be- this as it may, bigotry and superstition
wreaked their vengeance on the Jews, and in doing so compelled
that people to exist by craft and artifice, wherever persecution was
heaviest and most watchful.
Ingenuity was stimulated to find forms of property that could
not be readily confiscated, or that were best suited for concealment,
and the Jews existed like the wild, by their capacity to evade the
vigilance and the vengeance of their persecutors. Finally a purer
and better view of Christianity took the venom out of the anti-
Jewish policy, and the race was made safer in the countries which
permitted to' it an asylum. But the ages of persecution left their
mark upon the persecuted. The defensive practices of the Jew were
not at once abandoned. The instinct of self-preservation, sharpened
by centuries of necessity, had projected into a national character
istic, and the Jewish genius was wrought upon material acquisition
The skill in this was the result of long endured suppression and
inequality, and in its turn generated prejudice, which is usually
the first stage in the abatement of persecution. But the hindrance of
inequality continued to fade away, especially in France and Eng
land, and it never had place in the polity of the United States. As
a result of its disappearance, the racial characteristic it had caused
is disappearing. The Jews are no longer exclusively devoted to
material acquisition in the countries where they are equal. Their
remarkable genius, their high endowment with the faculty of imag
ination, their qualities of patience and persistence, are now directed
into literature, art, civics and science. In the countries where they
are a part of the body politic they are doing their share to elevate
the national name and to sustain the national honor.,
All of this is made plain by the Zionist movement. Mr. Otto
Irving Wise, in his address on that subject in this city, said the
longing of the Jew for a restoration of Judea was shown to be in
proportion to his tribulations. If Judea were again planted, its first
people would issue from Russia and the Danubian countries, where
the Jew has the least or no rights at all. It is doubtful whether the
Jews of France, England and the United States would take any more
than an academic or patriotic interest in the new state. Rabbi Levy,
commenting upon Mr. Wise's statement, of the case, said the Jews
are contented in a country like the United States, and would join
another exodus only under compulsion of necessity to aid a move
ment for the benefit of their less happy brethren.
We join him in doubting the exodus of a considerable number
of American Jews to restore the nationality of the race, even though
it promised to renew the glories of Solomon and the magnificence of
the Maccabees. They are* here, a -part, of the business, social and
intellectual life of the republic. No line divides them and sets them
apart. Their s} - mpathies are American and they think in terms of
American patriotism. They prosper and contribute to the prosperity
of others. They are not here Jn Egyptian captivity, making bricks
without straw. Quite to the contrary they are here as American
citizens, a conspicuous illustration of the blessing and benefit of free
and equal political institutions. No doubt they will support the
Zionist movement for the benefit of their brethren, who are in worse
than Egyptian captivity under the superstitious and bigoted rule of
Russia. To the latter, location in a state which they would learn to
rule and in time make great would be a blessing." They issue from
Russia sharpened $n all the characteristics that are produced by
persecution. They are ages behind the free Jews of the world. If
established where persecution could not reach them, they would
have the sympathetic attention of most of the world, while they
worked out a problem of government for themselves. But the Ameri
can Jew, taking his political equality as a proud birthright, will be in
no hurry to surrender it, and expatriate himself to the land: of his
ancestors.
INEQUALITY OF THE JEWS.
"We hadn't had the oysters in the
cellar long before I took to noticln' that
the pet duck was payin' consider'ble at
tention to my doin's down cellar, and
eveiy wunst in a while I'd see the duck
standln" in at the head o' the cellar
steps, with its neck stretched, lookin'
nnd Ustenin 1 at what was goin'* on
down below, but I hadn't any idee the
duck was thlnkin* up things more than
jest to satisfy Its snoopy curiosity.
One day 1 was settin' in one corner o'
the cellar, sortln' Haters, when I heard
somethln" come stumpin' and^thumpin'
down the steps. I looked up and see
the duck on its way down; clow and
deliberate. The duck couldn't- see me,
'way off there In the dark corner, and,
notlcin" that It had somethln' partlc'lar
on Its mind, I sot still to see what that
somethln' rartlc'lar mowt be.
" "The duck thumped on down the
steps till ll got to the bottom, and' then
it wad-stepped over to where the
oysters was. It stopped close to 'em.
looked 'em over a spell, and then piped
up that whistle o' mine so true to
natur' that I thought I must 'a' # fer
got myself and had piped It up myself.
In a second every oyster popped its
shell wide open, but the next second
every one of 'em went shet with a snap
that showed that the sight o' the duck
skeert 'em out o' their wits. The duck
stood still a minuto, lookin' consider'ble
surprised Itself, and then tried to fool
them oysters ag'ln by aoundln' that
whistle o' mine. But only one o' the
family was ketched that time, and that
un was tho big oyster's baby. It hadn't
cut its eye teeth yit I s'pose, and when
the duck whistled the second time the
little feller opened up agin. He. mowt
'a* closed right away agin, mebbe, but
he didn't git the chance. His shell was
no sooner open* then the duck grabbed
him and yanked him out quicker than

was bigger and livelier than any o' the

of her young uns that somehow or other
hadn't been shook off when she was
jtanked out of her bed. and she seemed
to think more o' that young un than she
did for her corn meal, though she was

FASHION'S MIRROR
SIMPLE in every detail, but affording quite a dressy effect, this smart
little shirt-waist suit can be used for occasions when a dressy toil
ette is indicated. A chemisette, in which the tuckings and rufflings are
arranged on a cross line, nils in the front, the trimming upon the blouse
itself taking the contrary, or lengthwise, line. Deep tucks In the shoulder
seam make the 'necessary fulness; and the sleeve, which is mounted un-
Hned. is a loose bishop pattern with a plain band for a cuff at the wrist-
The skirt is shirred to the band, and at knee death a vefy full flounce is
shirred ,bn with many rows of stitching and a puckered heading, while a
sash oÂ£ broad black velvet ribbon is tied around the waist, the loops and
ends in the back being omitted or not. Just as may.be desired. :. r t-.

The Chutes.
Hobart's. and a farce with less plot
than common. Not that It matters with
Miss Irwin around. Mrs. Black Is a
kind of lady "man from Mexico," and
from one small He finds, herself involved
In a. thousand. Little Johnny is ex
pected home as the scene opens and
Mrs. Black's husband has bought him
everything from a rocking horse to a
drum. The young gentleman is mean
while Journeying from England to New
York and his advent is heralded to his
fond mamma by a Mexican person who
has won $400 from him at cards. "Isn't
that cute for a 10-year-old?" asks his
mamma. Her sister, Emily, the son,
the valet, are all gayly lugged in to
help, and Mrs. Black says: "Cheer up,
Emily, the worst Is yet to come." The
scene ends with mamma In a faint, only
arousing: to object to the water that is
brought to .recover her. Thr^e acts it
takes to: the- telling 1 of little Johnny's
final acknowledgment, and If it is not so
ingenious as might be. Miss Irwin
would carry the farce If it were ten
times less so.
One hardly, knows where May Irwin
Is at her funniest. When she told the
automobile story there was a hysteric
flre of gig&les, the bigr\one where she
ends up with "We were thrown out
high and dry â high and dry â both." It
takes Miss. lrwin's big gorgeous mouth
to do the telling, and you don't know
whether it is funniest open or shut
"Trying to . keep 'an automobile wife
on a wheelbarrow salary" as a cause
for bankruptcy lost nothing from Miss
Irwin's genial delivery and her "I'm
not very strong" induced more hys
terics. But she Is throughout nobly
humorous, drollery incarnate. She
brings the same ripe, insinuating:con
tralto to her song and there Isn't any
one who. can sing a coon song with
May ' Irwin. -- Good . they* all are, and
ripe . for the whistle.
The supporting company Is not brilliant,
though very efficient in some of its mem
bers.. Jane Busby in particular is qharm
ing as ' the sympathetic . sister of Mrs.
Black. 6he. is as gopd In her "wholesome,
happy, natural way as Miss Irwin her
self, and an excellent foil for that genial
tarradlddler. May ?ooriohue Is capital as
the Irish cook. Lizzie. - One could do* with
a great deal more'Of Lizzie. The part of
the valet is another very well played by
John E. :â¢" Hazzard. ' Louis ; Foley as the
physical' culturist makes 6ne regret Lionel
Barry more, . and the other men fill in in
definitely. ' But May lrwln* is back, and
that will suffice the Columbia for at least
two weeks." 1 - .

Herschel Mayall and Edna Elsmere had
a thrilling life-saving scene at the Central

Bridge at Midnight" that should attract
large audiences -for the rest of the week.
In the scene where a bridge over the Chi

order, with ships and tugs puffing- across
the stage, the leading people of,the,Cen
tral risk their lives nightly. Hanging by
ropes to the bridge, the actors mentioned
are carried up into the air- for^thlrty
feet, and as the bridge lowers the pair
are landed safely on the deck of a^pass

of Mayall and Miss Ellsmere, good work
was done by, Henry Shumer, George P.

Next week Kipling's famous , "The

the comedy is produced at the Alcazar,
probably ; because the lines written for
the male characters are more suscep
tible of worldly aphorisms; but Miss
Adele ; Belg-arde as Lady Bracknell
keeps "cLose pace with the two men
who strive to be Ernest to please the
girls who "just dote" on that name.
The second act does not go" with the
dash of the rest o** the production,
there not being the, rapid fire exchange
of witticisms in the. scenes in which
the women . are more prominent that
there is in those where Glendenning
arid .; Whittlesey ' appear as the mirth
makers. - Miss s Eugenic Thais Lawton
was a self-possessed Gwendolen and

Ing up the Joke. Not all the time, but:
if Miss Irwin 'ever works hard -to make'
her points she worked hard last night.
Would then the Irwin giggle turn loose

In the country get her meed. But San
Francisco did not do itself proud last
night. , ',
Farce aa a fine art '.is- not the common
est thing in town, and that is what May.
Irwin brings. We are used to the other
kind. The sheer naturalness, the joyful
realism with which May Irwin Invests the
most gorgeously ridiculous situation is
not In It. Actually, one aches to help her
out In her tarradiddllngâ as Mrs. Black
she has shown her age of seven years,
and Is thus hardly put to it to ex
plain a se*-enteen-year-old,Bon to her sec
ond husband.' Mrs. Black has invented
an Aunt Prue, who takes- charge of .the
supposed ten-year-old. -Her son return
ing with a valet she evolves a husband
for the Aunt. Prue from the valet. She
explains the situation to- the valet,- and
anything more, absurdly delicious than
May Irwin at "the explanation Is not
Imaginable. So throughout, but it may
take a day or two~for May Irwin's' fun
to come horne â and it is not Miss Irwin's

Registration for the November election
wHI cose on September 27.. On and after
September 15 the main office of registra
tion at the City Hall will be open every
evening until the close of enrollment.
Two hundred machines, one for each
â¢ Toting precinct, will be used at the mu
nicipal election on November 7, and it is
expected thst citizens will be apprised of
the result of the contest within one hour
efter the polls close. Prior to the elec
tion machines will be placed in various
-bectiens of the city In order to give vot
ers an object lesson In their use.
It Is understood that the Board of Elec
tion Commissioners will follow the law
in respect to the place . of preference of
party ballots on the machine. The law
holds that the party which cast the
largest number of votes at the preceding
general election shall have the prefer
ence. It Is an open question, however,
whether any advantage would be, gained
i>y a party having th,e top position, as the
column for each party is very clearly and
conspicuously designated. The machine
â¢will render an accurate tally of all the
votes cast and give to each and every
candidate -an exact count of the ballots
<ast In his favor. The fact that the Com
missioners decide to use the machine In
every precinct is especially gratifying to
the Republicans.
It is understood that machines will be
placed in the Ucion League Club and at
headquarters of the San Francisco Repub
lican League, so that voters may become
familiar with the new method of voting.

found knowledge as to the ethics of local
politics, and while he may not be as con-
Epicuous en the floor of the coming con
vention as he was four years ago In the
Metropolitan Temple convention, which
ushered Mr. Schmitz from the Columbia
Orchestra to the arena of local politics,
he will always be rated as a leading light
In the expedition wluc~ discovered

would suggest a special button for Parry

The joint committee was entertained by
Percy Morgan in San Francisco last night
and the discussion of the pure wine law
was continued after dinner had been
served. To-morrow the wine men will go
to Napa, Calistoga and St. Helena', and
will ; meet, en route, Congressman -Bell
and 'former State Senator :C-:: C- : ; M. Larue.
Asa result of the visit. of the committee
of the American Wine Growers' Associa
tion to California* and of their conferences
with California- growers,* there will ;be
harmony among the wine, men of :the
United State 3. â¢ They have settled many
mooted points and agreed to work, to
gether for needed legislation.
President Emerson jof - the Brotherhood
Wine Company of New, York, Editor Lee
J. Vance of the American Wine Press,
President Randall of -the Chautauqua
Wine Company and Julius Crance.mana
ger of. the Urbana Wine Company,, being
empowered by the American- Wine Grow
ers' Association :to act for them,' have
; met Messrs. Morgan, Sbarboro and" other
i prominent California vlticulturists in con
i feience.-and the outcome has -been a" de
! cisisn to pool jssues and urge laws
i bentflt to the wine Industry "in general.
.The Easterners;, have been in, the State
for some days, and as previous visits had
made them familiar with i local conditions ;
j they lost little time . in dispatching busl
! ness. -At fa meeting at 5 Asti yesterday
l they drew the outlines of -a bill that will
be L introduced In, Congress. '
j Mr. Vance, speaking for the committee
of Eastern wine men, last night said:
"We have agreed on astandard for Ameri
can wines, and the Caiixornians are with
us in every way. \u25a0' '.Under the proposed law
sophisucated wines will be- under, govern
ment control. We are following the oleo
margarine law in^the. methods of enforce
ment only.
"We have also decided on .extensive
educational '"or propaganda work, hoping
to teach the public the use and value 1 of
pure wines. 'This we regard as of .vital
importance. East and West are now un
der one flag, which files for- the purity of
American' wines' regardless of ' the
geographical lines which give us Eastern
types, California types or what not." \u0084
It is understood that glucose, wine mak
ers, raisin wine ; makers '\u25a0 and other com
pounders will have , to flee to â¢ the hills
I when the law demands the real article
under a j genuine label. â¢ ' , -' â¢
The f flowing officers were j yesterday
elected to serve on- a joint commit
tee," which will represent the East and
j West, 'and which is to work in the ln
â¢ terests of the industry: Chairman of joint
} committee," Ev R. Emerson, who is presi
Â» dent of the American Wine Growers'* As-
J sneiation; vice chairman of Joint commit
i tee, Percy "Morgan of California. ' Lee. J.
i Vance, who is secretary of the American
Wine Growers' Association, is to act as
the Eastern secretary of the joint com-
I miltce, and Professor E. H. Twight, sec-
I retary and: treasurer of the California Vi
ticultural Club, will be" Western secretary
for the joint committee.

A change to the rlgiit kind of food
can lift one from a sick bed. A lady in
Welden. 111.. Â«aya:
"Last spring I became bedfast with
te\>re stomach trouble accompanied by
elck headache. I got worse and worse
until I became so low I could scarcely
retain any food at all, although I tried
every v kind. I had become completely
discouraged, had given up all hope and
thought I was doomed to starve to
death, till one day my husband; trying
to find something i could retain. brought
home some Grape-Nuts. â¢ A2;Ji ;
"To my surprise the food agreed with
me; digested perfectly and without, dis-
tress. I began to .gain strength at
once, my flesh (which had been flabby)
grew firmer, my health improved in
every way and every day/and in a very
few weeks I gained 20 pounds in weight.
I liked Grape-Nuts so well that for *
months I ate no other food.and always
felt as weil satisfied after eating as if I
had sat down to a fine banquetl .
"I had no return of the miserable sick
stomach nor of the headaches, ' that I
used to have when I ate other food. I
am now a well woman, doing all my
own work again, and feel that life is
worth living. :
"Grape-Nuts food has been a godsend
to my family; it surely saved my t life
and my two little boys have.thriven on
It wonderfully." Name given by Post-
urn Co.. Battle Creek. Mich.

"The New York Central will ; occupy

used. by the* postal authorities as a' sub- ;
i station. '"This .will " not" disturb the

stock. There was a large attendance : of
lawyers and. laymen. Before beginning
with the trial Judge Beatty made a little
speech, as follows: Â«. ' .
. "Gentlemen of the bar and representa
tives .of the^citizens of San Francisco, I
congratulate you upon the completion of
this beautiful building. Every part of
this country and many ! parts of remote
foreign lands have been diligently searched
to obtain the costly woods, marbles and
other materials that have entered into Its
construction. Without being an architect
or an expert on such matters, I certainly
am very deeply impressed with the build
ing. This room is the most costly court
room that I have ever seen. I presume it
Is technically artistic, but we are- not to
infer from that that justice is to be- tech
nically construed or administered here,
but, on the contrary, ,in a plain, straight
forward; manner."

approvingly upon the two Judges, and
the trial beganâ a paltry $SCQO case" In a

â¢ - MTn/riFi,icrrr of suits.
'*. When the case was called before
Judge Seawell yesterday affidavits
were read In -which' H.: F. Peart and
\u25a0 Paul M. Nippert, officials of the Aetna
Company, set forth . the fact of their
notification of withdrawal from Ma
estretti's- 125,000 bond. Attorney
George F. Hatton, representing the
" surety company, further stated that
. the reason that prompted the surety
company to withdraw from the bond
was that a multiplicity of suits had
â¢. been filed against the Works Commis
sioner by persons that had been in
jured through the deplorable condition
of the streets.
Maestretti was called to the stand at
this point and testified that when the
surety company went on his bond it
had full knowledge of the liability, that
might fall upon it. But, he said, its
excuse in the case at bar was not a
valid one, for the suits referred to were 1
filed against the members of the Works
Board personally and could not in any
â¢way affect the surety company, which
was liable alone to the city for any
act of the commission that might re
sult in loss to the municipal govern
ment.
â¢Attorney R. A. Countryman, 'repre
senting Maestretti, sought to show that
-there could be no liability upon either
principal or bondsman for the condi
tion of the streets, for, said Country
.luan, the Board of Works has expend
ed, or provided for the" expenditure of
all of the money that has come into
its hands for the repair of streets, and
can do no more. l-
HIVTS AT POLITICS.
Judge Seawell said he could not try
these issues, but Countryman said he
wanted to get me facts into the rec
â¢rd, for it was a. remarkable coinci
â¢ dence that the Aetna Company should
-have withdrawn from Maestretti's bond
just on the eve of the primary election.
There might not be any particular po
litical significance in the surety com
pany's act of withdrawal, but the coin
cidence was peculiar, he said.
The argument then drifted to a con
â¢ Btruction of the Jaw under which the
â¢surety company wishes to withdraw
from the bond. The law is plain and
provides for the withdrawal of a'
.surety on the lines followed by the
"Aetna Company. Countryman contend
ed, however, that the law which was
â¢ passed years ago, refers solely to
gratuitous sureties, but that the bond
signed by the Aetna Company^ was a
contract that could not be broken wlth
â¢ out the' consent of both parties.
Counsel for the Aetna Company dis
agreed with this view, simply quoting
"the statute and leaving it to the court
to give construction to its provisions.
This done Judge Seawell took the or
der to show cause, together with the
\u2666 demurrer of the respondent, under ad
â¢ visement.
Brodofsky subsequently filed against Mr.
Bostwick.
It was on Witt street, near the t San
Bruno road, whore theÃrodofskys and
the Bostwicks are neighbors, that the
fight occurred. Mr. Brodcfsky is a ped
dler, and was seated upon his wagon
when Mr., Bostwick, who is a carpenter,
turned oral dispute into actual conflict
by stabbing at him 'with a , chisel, said
Implement beiue of the kind- termed
"ripplngV by the craft. / \u25a0 ,
The howl of anguish emitted by Mr.
Brodofsky when the chisel punctured him
attracted the attention of. his helpmeet,
and the tree limb, twice as long and al
most as thick as herself, being the only
weapon instantly available she seized It
and went to the help of her sorely-beset
spouse. Mr. Bostwick was trying most
strenuously to make another incision in
Mr. Brodofsky's person when the tree
limb smote his neck and Incapacitated
him for further combat.
"When we look at this, frail little wom
an." said a special attorney for the prose
cution, "and think of the 'heff of that
tree limb, can we do aught except admire
the conjugal, loyalty that imbued her
with such phenomenal strength?. Nay. can
we find aught except censure for the de
fensive plea that would utilize her noble
act as a mitigatory circumstance?"
"Ef I hedn't shtriked ' him," said the
frail little woman, "he mine hoosband
vould hey kilt." ...
Continuance asked for and granted.
