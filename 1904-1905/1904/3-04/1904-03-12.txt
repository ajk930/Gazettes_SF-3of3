filed an affidavit In the District. Court,

and announced that no heirs lived.
Then the property was transferred to
John Osmer, husband of MoUie Osmer,
who died intestate, as was supposed.
When no heir could be discovered the
property was transferred to Osmer on
the plea that Mrs. Osmer made an oral

There is a strong probability that the military compulsory
closure of operations at the American mining concession, which is
midway between Peju and Anju, is the center of the probable bat
tle zone. Women and children have already been removed, and
the Japanese employes have deserted.
The Japanese are foraging for grain throughout Korea,
telling the Koreans they must help defend their own .interests.
Japan is pressing for a concession of the Seoul-Jibu Railway,
which .was allowed; to -lapse by the French concessionaires, and
will probably demand a strip of land ten miles on either side of
this land for colonization. Japan will thus possess railway com
munication from, the northernmost point to the southernmost
point of Korea.
The present purpose of the Japanese is apparently to mass
a great army at the narrowest part of the country above Ping
yang and await Russian attacks' for a reasonable time, failing in
which a forward march , will be commenced. PossiHy a co-op
erating column will be landed at Wonson for the eastern coast
work, ultimately arriving before Vladivostok.
Telegraphic communication with Angil has suddenly been
interrupted, indicating a Russian advance southward, probably
with the idea of dislodging the Japanese at Pingyang before
they are strongly intrenched. The final movement from Seoul
will be made northward to-day. Only one garrison is remaining.
The northern Korean ports will be ice free in a week, and
then probably the bulk of the Japanese will be. landed near Chin
amp, obviating a six days' march. Japanese military cur
rency is being issued here under Korean imperial sanction.
The Americans from the Pingyang district have assembled at
Chenampo to await a transport to Chemulpo by a Japanese
steamer. This has been arranged through the courtesy of the Jap-
WOMEN AXD CHILDREN REMOVED.
Pingyang will be the northern Japanese base under Major
General Kigoshi. It is an ancient walled stronghold, capable of
easy defense. The guard already there is hurrying forward forti
fication of the walls. A landing will shortly commence at Won
son, where arrangements are perfect.
A garrison of 6000 men is permanently established at
Seoul. New barracks are near completion here, and also at
Mesampso, Fussan, Wonson, Mokpo and in Northern Korea.
The vicinity of Pingyang and Anju already has been the
scene of the first land engagement in the present war, when the
Russian scouts were forced to retire after a short skirmish. Cer
tain routes south of the Yalu River leading to Pingyang are still
held by the Russians, where each village contains cavalry ag
gregating 3000.

SEOUL, March 9 (via Chefu, March ii).â The Japanese
will have an army of 150,000 men in Korea within three weeks,
including 35,000 already landed at Chemulpo. The scene there
daily is one of disorder and chaos. The harbor's edge is .piled
with 200,000 tons of stores, packs of equipment, light guns and
carriage bullet-proof shields, and there are 5000 cavalry and pack
horses there.
Troops daily entrain for Seoul, whence they advance to the
north in bodies of a few hundred or march direct overland or
proceed in open boats fifty miles to Haiju. Thus the country
north of Seoul is starred with parties converging into the Ping
yang neighborhood. A number of three-inch field guns made in
Japan.have been Jarjded at. Haiju. and moved north.

"Of the ships which participated in the night attack, one of

"At 9 o'clock fourteen of the enemy's ships assembled, before

"This last occurred at I o'clock in the afternoon. It is esti

battle. Our losses were one officer slightly wounded, one soldier
killed and four wounded.
"The illumination of the sea at night by searchlights mount

"With the commencement of the bombardment at dawn the
guns of the fortress replied to the enemy's fire.
"The crews of all the ships engaged gave proof of remarka
ble coolness in action. Below decks the work of the day followed
its ordinary course in spite of the shells falling between the ves
sels and covering them with fragments. A bombardment at
such a distance must be regarded as ineffective, but the Japanese
cruiser Takasago (second class, 4227 tons) is reported to have
been seen to suffer serious damage, the extent of which, however,
it was impossible to ascertain at a distance of five miles. Many
shells were fired at a range of seven and a half miles."
"When the critical position of -the Stereguschtchi became
evident I hoisted my flag on the cruiser/Novik and went with the
Novik and the cruiser Boyarin to the rescue. But as five of the
enemy's cruisers surrounded our destroyer, and as their battle
ship squadron was approaching, I did not succeed in saving the
Stereguschtschi, which foundered. Part of the crew were made
prisoners and part were drowned.

steps toward the organization of a
non-Mormon party. A committee was
appointed to formulate a plan of cam

conditions now existing in Utah. An
other committee was appointed to pre
pare and submit to a future mass

have condoned the offenses against the
laws of the State forbidding polyga

cross-examination the witness said
that Hahn had not shown any great
feeling, but that, knowing' there had
been no good feeling between Hahn
and Dietrich, he had supposed the
condition of affairs had grown out of
that circumstance. At the conclusion
of Pope's testimony the committee
took a recess.
FISHER DENIES STORY.
On reassembling J. S. Wlliams, editor
of the Hastings (Nebr.) News, was
called. Fisher told Williams, accord
ing to his testimony, that Dietrich had
said that he was to pay $15,000 to be
elected Senator. Fisher, according to
the witness, said, "Charley (speaking
to Dietrich), I would not have done it.
I would not have paid this sum of
money to be Senator."
To this Dietrich replied:
"Never mind, Jack, that is nothing.
I have the appointment of all the post
offices in the South Platte, and there
are ways of making money on the side
In the Senate." Williams said It was
notorious that candidates for post
master had to put up for campaign ex
penses of Senators.
Jacob Fisher, present postmaster of
Hastings, Nebr., flatly contradicted the
testimony of Hahn and Williams, and
was still on the stand when the com
mittee adjourned until to-morrow.

LEOPOLD HAHN.
DIETRICH NOT FRIENDLY
Replying to a question from Senator
Hoar, Hahn eaid that when Dietrich
was elected he had given up all idea of
being continued as postmaster because
he had understood from various sources
that Dietrich was "after his scalp."
Asked if his feeling toward Dietrich
was very friendly, he admitted that it
was not
Hahn also testified to Fisher's good
character, and said that Fisher had
supported Dietrich loyally. Fisher had
told him that he (Fisher) was friendly
to him for reappolntment, but had told
him he was satisfied that he. (Hahn)
could not get it.
Beatty cross-examined Hahn and the
witness said that he had known Fisher
for twenty-five years. He said that
Fisher had told him that Dietrich had
said to him that Breed was to give
$2800. The witness added that he had
talked with Breed more than once and
that Breed had told him the story of his
offer was true.
"I was a candidate for. the position of
postmaster before the Senatorial fight
began." said the witness, "but Diet
rich said to everybody that I could not
have the place. He had always fought
me before when I ran for office, while
I had loyally supported him."
He admitted that he had frequently
said that "it was a long road that had
no turning, and that he would see that
when .Dietrich's term was out he
did. not get another election."
GAVE ADVICE TO FISHER.
Hahn would not admit, however, that
he had said that he would spend $10,000
to beat Dietrich. He had given Fisher
his word of honor that he would not re
peat the conversation, but admitted
that he had shown the memorandum to
his deputy half an hour after it_was
written.
"After I had written it I thought I'd
better show it to him, so that. some one
v.-ould know of It in case of ray death,"
he said.
John D. Pope was the next witness.
He is a former Nebraska State Senator,
an attorney, who Hahn testified. had
advised as to the course Fisher would
have to pursue with the note for $2500,
which Fisher had told Hahn he wanted
to give to Dietrich for the postmaster
ship.
Pope said he had a conversation
with Hahn on the train between
Lincoln and Hastings. Hahn asked
him whether a note given for the pur
pose of securing an appointment
could be defaulted and he had an
swered in the affirmative. He said rat
the same time Hahn had told him
that Fisher had agreed to pay. $2500
to Dietrich for the office and wanted
to know If he save a note for that

the State as a result of the investiga
tion of Reed Smoot's election now be
ing conducted by the United States
Senate, the Telegram to-night prints a
dispatch from Logan, Utah, describing
the regular monthly fast meeting held
In the tabernacle at that place. The
/neeting, which crowded the hall to suf
focation, was addressed among others
by J. M. Blair, who made a strong de
fense of polygamy, Heber Carlisle suc
ceeded Blair. He declared with great
emphasis that Congress and the entire
country were the persecutors of the
Mormon church, and then defended
polygamy, -declaring it a doctrine of
God and a revelation that had been
given to the prophet. Joseph Smith. He
approved of the conduct of President
Smith at Washington, declaring in con
clusion, "if the present difficulty makes
it necessary I will be ready to die for
President Joseph F. Smith."
"W. S. Lamoreaux then arose and
amid much excitement declared that
he believed in loyalty to the United
States Government. It was dangerous,
he said, to say such things as the pre
ceding speaker had given utterance to,
and that the Mormon church is not now
teaching polygamy, that the church
had given up such teachings and that
there was no occasion for such re
marks. Here Councilor Isaac Smith,
the presiding officer, ordered Lamo
reaux to take his seat, which he did.
Â¦WASHINGTON, March 11.â The Sen
atorial Inquiry into the charges against
Senator Dietrich of Neijjaska began
to-day before the special, committee in
Senator Hoar's committee room. The
inquiry, which was instituted upon the
demand of Senator Dietrich, is" for Xhi
purpose of disproving the " charges on
which the Senator was indicted last,.
iall in Nebraska and whlcb were dis
missed Â«n- dcimirrer. - The committee"'
consisted of Senators Hear, Platt of
Connecticut, Spooner, Cockrell and
Peltus.
All the members of the committee
except Senator Spooner were present
-when the inquiry began. Senator Diet
rich was in attendance with his attor
ney, R. E. Beatty of Hastings, and re
iyÂ«ited his wish that the investigation
should be the fullest possible.
Leopold Hahn. postmaster at Has
tings from 1897 to 1901. was the first
witness. He was succeeded in that
office by Mr. Fisher. In reply to ques
tions by Senator Hoar. Hahn related
a conversation with Fisher on April 2S,
1901. relative to his (Fisher's) appoint
ment as Dostmaster.
"He asked me." said the witness,
â¢"what the office paid. I told him $2500.
He said that was what Dietrich wanted
him to pay for the office. He also told
me that Adam Breed had said that Die
trich had asked him J2S00. or $700 a
3'ear. for the four years. He .asked me
""bat I had paid Senator Thurston for
my appointment, 'and I said, 'Not one
cent." "
PRODUCES JIEMORAXDUM.
The witness also said that Fisher had
Questioned him as to whether he (Fish
er) would have to pay a note for $2500
If he should give one, and the witness
said he had volunteered to investigate
that point for him, and had done so,
petting legal advice that such a note
would not be negotiable. At a later
date Fisher had come to his store with
William Dutton and they had an
nounced that they were there for the
purpose of "fixing up the postofflce
business." He then retired. Hahn then
produced the following memorandum,

of the conversation, thirty minutes
after it occurred:

American shipbuilders cannot build ships as
chonply In the United States as foreign ships
are built, largely because of the wages men of
our cratt receive, which are far hlsher than

We stnnd for the American standard of wages
and of living-, and are better citizens because
we enjoy them. We want no diminution In
our wages Rnd no reduction In â¢ our style of
living: but we want to stand p.s do worklnK
men in other trades, on the American level.
They are r.ble to do so. largely because our
Government protects them as,alnÂ«t the free
competition of foreign products. Our ships- In
the deep sea trade ara unprotected, and so
cannot compete with fcrelsn ship?. Congress
should remedy thin condition, and this we
ask. The bills above named will help, where

WASHINGTON, March 11.â The only
witness on the stand to-day in the in
vestigation of the Senator Smoot case
before the Senate Committee on'Priv
ileges and Elections was E. B. Critch
low, formerly Assistant Unite'd States
Attorney for Utah. He continued his
history of the Mormon church, detail
ing instances in which the high offi
cers of the church have manifested
their power over the members in order
to compel obedience in all affairs, and
in which excommunication has been
the price of the independent spirit. Sen
ator Beveridge assisted in the examina
tion, and his attempt's to prove cer
tain evidence incompetent livened what
otherwise would have been the first dull
day of the hearing.
Many women, representing organiza
tions interested in the contest, arrived
in Washington to-day for the purpc-se
of perfecting their plans and wage a
more effective contest. They attended
the sessions of the committee and after
the hearings met in committee rooms
and discussed the progress made.
E. B.. Critchlow of Salt Lake City re
sumed his statement in regard to the
conditions in Utah and the prosecutions
of polygamists.
Following the history of the State
down to Smoofs candidacy for the Sen
ate, Critchlow said Smoot announced
his candidacy for the Senate first in
1900, and that the announcement met
with 'opposition from Republicans and
others.
The objections were manifested, ac
cording to the witness, at the Salt Lake
city elections for members of the Leg
islature and in expressions from the
Ministerial Association of Utah.
The witness said that laymen in the
Mormon church felt that the candidacy
of an apostle wourd be unwise, when it
was charged that a quorum of the first
presidency and apostles were living in
open defiance of the laws against
polygamous cohabitation.
Senator Beveridge questioned the.
witness in regard to the general repu
tation of Senator Smoot, particularly
as to whether he is a polygamist.
Critchlow said he had never heard it
charged that Smoot has more than one
wife.
Reference was made to the necessity
of the Mormons to secure the' consent
of their associates to go into certain
business projects r and the'effeet- 6f tho
proceeding when such a consent was
withheld. Critchlow said that it was
the opinion of many persons that if
offlcer"s,~ L Such as apostles, should enter
politics there was no chance for lay'
men and they .would hot dare to aspire,
to high political honors. .The necessity
of apostles to secure consent is equiv
alent to church endorsement when that
consent is given, said the witness.
"You say they would not dare aspire
to .office," said Senator Beverldgc.
"What would happen if they did?"
"They would be held to be out of
harmony and not, disposed to take
counsel of those higher in the church."
"What would be done to them?"
"They would be disfellowshiped and
ostracized from the church."
"Do you know of any who have been
disfellowshiped for independent politi
cal action?"
The witness said he did not know
any that- he could mention.
The witness, when asked concerning
Senator Smoot's power to prevent vio
lations of the laws in regard to polyga
mous cohabitation, said:
"By one word Smoot could either stop
what is going on or cease to be an
apOBtle."
He had got up the protest again3t
Senator Smoot at the suggestion of Dr.
W. M. Padden, the first signer of tho
protest, witness having prepared the
protest against Brigham H. Roberts
and being familiar with the proceed
ings.
Mr. Critchlow said he had obtained
most of the signatures to the protest.
Senator Beveridse asked ' if any one
signed the .Drotest without reading it.
"One, I believe," was the answer,
"Ezra Thompson, Mayor. Mr. Thomp
son had heard the protest explained
and knew what was in it."
The names of John R. Winder, Presi
dent Hatch and President Clough were
read to show that persons who are not
polygamists have attained high posi
tions during. Smith's presidency.
Critchlow responded that they were
exceptions because of their great pop
ularity and the fact that it was well
known their wives had greater influ
ence over them than the church. Each
of the men mentioned, he added," is said
to have an exceptional wife.
To show the" general feeling of gen
tiles toward Mormons Van Cott brought
out in the cross-examination that
Critchlow voted to elect pc-Iygamlsts
as members of the. constitutional con
vention and that he" had been on the
stump with John Henry Smith, who is
a polygamist. .
As Chairman Burrows adjourned the
committee until to-morrow, he re
marked: "All this exemplifies what is
often stated, that politics makes
strange bedfellows."
;, The following statement was Issued
after a meeting of the, women:
"At a meeting of the executive board
of the National League of Women's
Organizations of American held to-day
in Washington a resolutlc-n was unani
mously adopted requesting that on Sun
day, ' March 27, or as soon thereafter
as- possible, every clergyman In the
United States ask every man ,to % write
to United \States Senators requesting
them, In view of the evidence already
presented in: the. case of Reed. Snioot,
to. vote against the retention of Smoot
in the highest law making body of the
country."

LOS ANGELES, March 11.â A freight
wreck on the Tustin branch of the
Southern Pacific yesterday resulted In
saving a man's life. A car was de
railed at a cattle guard while the train
was moving slowly, and the crew was
trying to get it back^n the track when
an old man came running across the
fields and shouted' to them that a man
was being suffocated in a well, about
half a mile distant. He Implored/ them
to come Iknd.help to get him 'out.
The railroad men rushed to the res
cue with the old man, a " ranchman
named Smith. The old man "explained
to them as they ran that his hired man
had gon'e'lo tTie"~B6ltorn~6f a' well 'about
fifty feet deep to cleanse a pump with
gasoline and had been overcome with
trie fumes of the volatile fluid.- Smith
was not strong enough to get the man
out bf*the pit by himself, but when he
had secured help he heroically, de
scended into the well and tied, a/rope
around the insensible man's body and
gave the signal to draw him -up. The
victim revived after being hauled' out
of. the pit, but In a few minutes more
the gasoline fumes would undoubtedly
have proved fatal to him* .'Â¦'

Isidore Golden is to retain his office
as Justice of the Peace in place of
Percy V. Long, resigned, according to
the opinion handed down yesterday
by Attorney General W. S. Webb.
The case is one that has excited
much attention, depending, as it did,
upon what authority was vested the
right to make the appointment in this
case. The facts of the case are these:
Percy V. Long was elected Justice of
the Peace on November 4. 1902, for
a term of two years, commencing
January 8, 1903. He filled that posi
tion until January 2, 1904, when he
resigned. On the same day Mayor
Schmitz appointed Walter Gallagher
to fill the unexpired term. On the
same day Governor Pardee appointed
Golden to fill the office and on Jan
uary 4 the Board of Supervisors ap
pointed Walter E. Dorn to fill the po
sition.
Thereupon Walter Gallagher,
through his attorneys, James G. Ma
guire and Joseph Leggett, asked per
mission of the Attorney General to
maintain an action in the name of
the people on his relation against
Golden and Dorn.
The Attorney General In his reply
states that no question Is made as to
the qualification of any one of said ap
pointees, but that the sole question
rests upon the fact of who had the legal
right to make the appointment. |V
Â¦The Attorney General went at ..great
length into the question and in his re
ply quoted Imany authorities upon the
subject at issue, but decided that as
the power to appoint a successor to a
Justice of the Peace is not otherwise
provided for in the constitution or
statutes of this State the power. is
vested in the Governor and that Golden
is the legal appointee.
â¢ "The granting of the leave to sue,"
he stated, "would, in his judgment, b-:
an abuse of discretion." Permission to
sue was therefore denied. â¢
BAKER CITY, Or., March 1Lâ Two
men were killed in a snowslide last
night at the Queen of the West mine,
in the Cornucopia district, sixty miles
northeast of here. The dead are:
H. W. HOLLAND.
A. C. COX.
Six others were injured, none, how
ever, fatally. The injured: G. W. Es
tates, Thomas Smith, Thomas Mills,
| John Hunt, Frank Larimer, Nels Lund
! strom.
The crash came at 5:30 o'clock, when
the miners were coming off the day
shift The slide razed the building and
bunkhouses and swept the occupants
down almost to the bottom of the can
yon, hundreds of feet below. The dead
and injured were recovered with diffi
culty from the. debris.
The mine is located in Bonanza Basin,
one mile from the spot where Super
intendent Fred C. Dobler.of the Cornu
copia mine lost his life a year ago. The
snow In the basin was from ten to 100
feet deep. The slide started midway
between the' Queen of the West mine
and Summit, gathering mass and mo
mentum as it thundered down the sides
of the mountain. With a tremendous
roar the avalanche struck the surface
plant of the mine and in a twinkling
all that was left to mark the spot was
the office occupied by Superintendent
Bert Smith. Below the mine the moun

A bold hold-up in the Mission shortly
after 6 o'clock last night resulted in
the capture of one of three men that
entered the grocery and saloon of
Edward Ringe, 2S62 Mission street.
At the time mentioned three men
walked into the saloon, where Albert
Ringe, son of the proprietor, was in
attendance, and called for three glasses
of beer. While young Ringe was in
the act of drawing the beer he was
ordered by one of the. three, who flour
ished a revolver, to throw up his hands
arid keep his mouth shut. The young
man obeyed with alacrity and one of
the. thugs walked behind the bar,
opened the cash register and extract
ed |8. .*;Â£
1 Ringe was then backed up against
the billiard table and one of the rob
bers proceeded to, search his. pockets.
At that juncture the elder Ringe, hear
ing the unusual noise in the saloon,
came downstairs from the living apart
ment, which is over the store. Hearing
him coming down the stairs, the rob
bers beat a retreat. They bolted out
of the door and ran up Twenty-fifth
street to Bartlett, running along that
street to Twenty-fourth, where they
separated: Just as they turned into
Twenty-fourth street, John Henderson,
who lives at 3347 Twenty-fourth" street,
caughx sight oÂ£ one of the fellows, who
held a pistol in his hand, and gave
chase. Henderson was told. to keep at
a distance or he would get shot. 'This
threat caused him to slacken his pace,
but, nevertheless, he kept sight of the
fleeing criminal, giving the alarm as
he followed. _
The, alarm attracted the attention of
W. H. Brucoe, a bootblack, whose
stand is on the street. Brucoe stepped
out and tripped up the fleeing thief,
throwing him to the sidewalk. Before
he had gained , his footing, Policeman
James Doran was on top of him and
placed the handcuffs on his wrists and
took him to the Seventeenth street sta
tion, where he was charged with rob
bery. . The pistol was found on the
street, where he threw It while being
pursued. The arrested man gave the
name of - Alfred > Reynolds, but"Tthis is
fictitious, as he was recognized ; as Al
fred Smith, whose brother. J.C. Smith,
keeps- a at Twenty-fifth and
Church streets. 'When searched at the
station $6 40 was found on him.
Smith is well known to the police of
RED BLUFF, March 11.â Some time
last night the postoffice at Vina, this
county, was broken Into and robbed.
The amount claimed to have been se
cured is about $2000, $700 of which be
longed to depositors and the balance
to the Postoffice Department. The rob
ber or robbers effected an entrance
through a rear door by breaking out
the - glass. A~*small . sheetiron door
between the hall and the postoffice was
opened with a cold chisel and the rob
ber did not have to use force on the
safe, whheh was a small one, but he
worked the combination, showing
familiarity with the lock or ihat he
was an expert. No clew is advanced
nor is the hour of the robbery known.
The night was stormy and the streets
were' nearly deserted. The registry
window was also broken open, which
leads to the theory that more than one
person participated.

1op of a terrific windstorm comes a'
biting cold snap and a heavy fall of
snow. Reports of damage from wind
are beginning to come in from the
country. The greatest damage so far
is to a flume carrying the tailings of
the North Star mine to Mitchell's
sand plant. Snow has been falling at
intervals since 2 o'clock this morn
ing and there is every indication of a
big snow storm before the end cames.
An electric storm this afternon inter

SAN DIEGO, March 11.â Last
night's rain' was general throughout
the county and brought from two
thirds" of ah inch to ari inch and three
quarters in different parts of the coun
ty. The heaviest fall was between' 1
and 2 o'clock this morning', when in
five minutes .16 of an inch fell. '. The
ground was parched and drank in all
the rain that fell and there are no
streams running even in the moun
tains where they start before they do
in the valleys. The greatest good will
come, to the grain raisers, for though
the grain Is very backward on account
of the dry winter another rain or two
will make hay at least. If the weather
continues warm the effect of the pres
ent rain will be'splendid and'if more
rain comes at the right time, ..the
present -rain will be counted worth
$200,000 to the county.

COLUSA. "arch 11. â The heavy
storm of Wednesday night lias caused
the river to rise rapidly and at this
place the gauge registers 27 feet 2
inches, lacking only 7H inches of be
ing up to the highest point rated dur
ing the high water of February. The
entire east side is again under water
from two to fifteen feet deep and
many of the lowland farmers are
again feeding their stock on the levees.
A break occurred to-day on the Da
vis Bros.' ranch on the west side about
fourteen miles above Colusa and it is
now about twenty feet wide. The
levee workers have hopes of closing
the breach by noon Saturday. If
they should fall the probabilities are
that thousands of acres of grain land
In southern Colusa and Yolo counties
will be flooded, the loss of which
would reach several hundred thou
sand dollars. This is the first break
that has occurred on the west side of
the river, but the waters have been
up bo long that the levees are becom
ing thoroughly soaked and other
breaks are feared. The levees will be
patched to-night by several hundred
men between Princeton and Grimes, a

SAN JOSE, March 11.â With the rain
that has been falling in the. Santa Clara
Valley for the last few days there is
little doubt that the coming year
will be a banner one. The rainfall for
the present storm, according .to the
Bank of San Jose rain gauge, was. 3.16
inches. For the twenty-four hours end
ing at 9 o'clock this morning .63 of an
inch had fallen. This gives a total of
11.14 inches for the season, against 12.75
inches for last year to the same date.
The indications are that the storm is
not over yet and that more rain may
be expected. A late spring is always
better for Santa Clara County, and
these late rains insure an immense
crop. It has also put the orchards in
fine condition. The grain that has been
sown is growing fast and the cattle
ranges in the foothills are assured of
all the feed that will be wanted. The
seed farms are also greatly benefited.
Rains Practically Insure a Great Crop
for thef Valley.

NEVADA, March 11.â Driver Joe
Downey of the Downieville stage line
and three passengers had a narrow
escape from drowning In Rush Creek
yesterday: The bridge was gone and
the party decided to ford the creek,
which was about twenty-five feet wide.
The. water ran in the bottom of the
stage, but they would have crossed
safely had not the off lead horse fallen.
This caused one of the wheelers to fall
under the tongue, leaving the stage
with its passengers in the middle of
the stream. " Driver Downey cut the
pole with an ax, releasing the horses,
but the two wheelers were carried down
into the Yuba River and drowned, while
the leaders ran off up the road. The
curtains were down, leaving the pas
sengers penned in. They managed to
cut the curtain and got out .through
the back, alightVng in the stream. A
rope was attached to the stage and two
passengers. Malcom Morrison and- Dan
McKenzie of Forest City, waded to the
shore. . James K. O'Brien of Smarts
vllle lost his footing and was being car

by the trousers. The passengers had
just left the stage when It was car

times, finally landing against a tree
just before reaching the ,rlver.>,..The
vehicle was fastened and will be taken
out when the water. recedes. Downey

provement, and with them supplies of
coke to furnaces and shipments of

in the slowness of Eastern buyers to

Captain Hansen was in command of
the vessel and the crew was a regula
tion coast crew of mixed nationalities.
The Oakland, another schooner in the
harbor, also dragged her anchors badly
during the storm in the early hours
of the morning and was narrowly saved
from a fate similar to that of the Mabel
Gray.
The vessel is lying about 200 yards
off shore and is in what is considered
a favorable position. The sea is still
running high, but It Is believed that if
the schooner maintains her present po
sition that a portion of the cargo may
be taken off and possibly the vessel
saved from total wreck.
The Mabel Gray arrived off the har
bor yesterday afternoon and dropped
her anchor to wait for a place at the
dock. A high sea was running all aft
ernoon and about midnight last night
the long ground swell caused her to
drag- her anchor hold and despite the
efforts of the crew to get another an
chor' hold the vessel went ashore at a
point about 200 yards from the wharf.
When the vessel struck a part of tha
cargo went overboard. The men clam
bered Into the! rigging and their shouts
for help soon attracted the attention
of people on the beach. No life-savins
apparatus was at hand, but a bonfire
was built and several ineffectual ef
forts made to get a line to the ship by
means of a launch. The effort was
finally successful and the seven men of
the crew came over it safely tp the
shore.
LOS 'ANGELES. March 11.â The
three-masted schocmer Mabel Gray,
owned by Dolbeer & Carson of San
Francisco, with a cargo of 270.000 feet
of lumber, consigned to the Ganahl
Lumber- Company of this city, went
ashore at Port Kedondo shortly after
2 o'clock this morning. The crew of
seven men, compelled to take to the
rigging when the ahlp went ashore,
were rescued two hours later. A ter
rific sea was running and it was only
by dint of desperate efforts that a line
was got to the ship and the men
brought ashore. A report from Re
dondo says that the captain of the ves
sel remained aboard until the last of
the crew had gone safely over the line
to the beach.
NAPA, March , 11.â From daylight

and one delegate for a majority fraction there

CALL FOR CONVENTION.
The call as published herewith was
considered line by line. The provisions
of the primary election law were fully
recognized and the recommendations
of the National Committee in respect
to Congressional district delegates ac
cepted. The. executive committee did
not make any recommendation as to
the meeting place of the- State con
vention. It is the general impression
that the State committee t6-day will
designate Sacramento. San Francisco
will have only 121 delegates in the
convention. This light representation
is due to .the fact, that many Repub
lican voters failed to support the
nominee of the party for Governor in
the last State campaign. Districts
south of Market street, which cast an
overwhelming vote for the Democratic
nominee, will have but very little
strength in the forthcoming conven
tion. The counties that upheld the
Republican standard will dominate
the convention.
Following is the text of the call
which the executive committee recom
mends:
Last night at the Union League
Club 'the executive committee of the
Republican State Central Committee
framed a call, for: a. State . convention
to select four Â¦ delegates at large to
the Republican National / Convention
to be held "in Chicago June 21, % 190*.
Th& apportionment of representation
is on the basis of j the \vote cast for
Governor Pardee at- the last State
election. The whole number of dele
gates to the State; convention will be
733. The call agreed upon by the
executive body will doubtless be ap
proved by " the ' general committee,
which will meet" at 2 pT mi. to-day in
Golden Gate Hall, gutter street, near
Taylor. ' â¢ . ,
In the absence of W. M. Cutter,
chairman, who 4s storm-bound some
where in the â¢ Sacra,mento Valley, the
first vice chairman", â¢" J.O. Hayes of
Santa Clara, presided at the meeting
of the executive^ committee last even
ing. Other members attending were
Harold T. Power, ' Placer; Thomas
FJint Jr., San Benito; John F. Davis,
Amador; John Bermingham Jr., Con
tra Costa; Charles .H. Spear and
Charles E. Snook,' secretary, Alameda;
R. N. Bulla, Los Angeles, and A. E.
Castle, Frank A; Schmitz, J. K. Wil
son and Jacob Steppacher, assistant
secretary, San ' Francisco. Thomas
Flint Jr. held proxies of William M.
Cutter of Tuba. E. F.-,Mitchell of
Fresno and Alexander M. Duncan of
Mendocino. Charles H. Spear ; held
the proxy of Bradner W. Lee of Los
Angeles. The proxy of .James A. Brit
ton was held by Charles E. Snook. R.
N. Bulla held the proxy of George P.
Adams of Los Angeles.

j House.
J The demand of the minority for a
j sweeping investigation of every branch
J of the Postoffice Department was not
! granted. The testimony or. this question
j came on a vote which resulted 144 to
! 125, a strict party vote.
| A resolution for an Investigation of
| the connection of the members of the
j department offered by Representative
; McCall of Massachusetts was ' then
i agreed to, only two members opposing
lit.
When the House, convened Gillett of
Massachusetts presented a privileged
report. -
Hay of Virginia promptly objected to
its consideration.
The Speaker in ruling on the point
said the Hay resolution was a matter
; of the highest privilege, and he recog
nized Overstreet of Indiana, who de
sired unanimous consent for an order
I giving members ten days' leave to ex
tend their remarks.
COOPER ENTERS OBJECTION.
N Cooper of Wisconsin entered an em
i phatic "I object."
! Overstreet then submitted two prop
! < Pitions. first that the discussion ex
j tend* until Monday at 4 o'clock, and
i the second that it extend until 4 o'clock
to-morrow.
Both propositions were objected to
by Hay. He then renewed his motion
' for leave to print, which brought Wil
liams of Mississippi quickly to his feet
with the declaration that whatever is
i said on this subject should be said in
i the open House, and he therefore ob
i Jected. He was greeted with applause.
â¢ Cowherd of Missouri was recognized
' and defended the action of the commlt
! tee presenting the report. There was
J no occasion, he said, to refer the mat
ter to the committee. The report of
General Bristow had gone out with the
' approval of the President.
! "I say now," he vigorously declared,
I "that if we must answer whether the
! charge is true ' that Beavers usually
! complied with the requests of members
I of Congress, regardless of the merits
Â¦ of the case, the answer is that the
charge is true."
William Alden Smith of Michigan
Jumped up and, holding up a copy. of
the report, called attention to the fact
that . one of the exhibits showed the
! words "White House" on it. He had,
i he said, examined the original papers
and the words "White House" were not
on them.
"I would like to know." he asked,
"who had the audacity to write the
words 'White House' on that report?"
COWHERD MAKES ANSWER.
"The Committee on Postoffices and
i Postroads never added a word," an
\ swered Cowherd, smarting und<# the
j Imputation.
"Somebody did," said Smith, with
j equal warmth'.
"Well, it was done in the depart
ment, then," Cowherd replied amid ap
plause.
! Cowherd then entered upon a vigor
ous and emphatic answer to the charges
I and epithets which members had hurled
I at the department. Continuing, he in
quired:
"Are you going to say to the coun
try that the department that lies about
you tells the truth' about its own ac
tions? Do you intend to go before your
constituency and the good people of
the United States and say that this
great department which has published
this report, 'conceived in sin and born
in iniquity,' is the purest and best and
most capable to examine into its own
iniquities?" (Loud applause.)
He was, he said, a partisan and a
party man, but he "put the honesty
and honorable management of a great
department of the Government above
the demands of any party "that ever
lived."
ATTACKS THE POSTOFFICE.
Crumpacker of Indiana put himself
on record in favor of a committee of
members, of both sides of the House
to investigate "the Indictments" made
against members.
"The Postoffice Department," Burle
son said, "reeks with rottenness and is
steeped with corruption,"-
Public opinion, he vigorously assert
| ed, after the postal disclosures, de
! manded further investigation.
j "It would not down," ( he said, "though
the gcri!eman at the other end of the
I avenue (referring to the President) had
I complimented this man upon the Â¦puri
: fication that had taken place." Â¦':
i This demand for an investigation, he
j declared, finally found expression in
the resolution of Hay.
"That is what struck terror to- the
gentleman who presides over the Post7
! office Department," he added, "and who
I is responsible for the document?*
"Are you going -to be intimidated?"
he added. "Every honest man named
I in the report owes it to himself to de
j mand an investigation."
I Clayton of Alabama was unsparing
in his criticism of the Postmaster Gen
eral,, to whom he referred as "that dis
tinguished imbecile who happens to be
Postmaster General of the United
States." Â¦ . ,
REPORT IS DENOUNCED.
Calderhead of Kansas said the Presi
dent and the Postmaster General' had
charged him with making a corrupt
contract with Beavers. ''They shall not
<lo It," he said, "without my protest
here or anywhere." He could not, he
said, approve of a report which mixed
the names of honorable men with those
of criminals.
Burket of Nebraska denounced -the
suggestion that he had unlawfully ob
tained increases for postoffices.' He
charged thet "somebody had bundled
up u me 6k of stuff in a haphazard
way" and the committee "has sprung
it as a bomb with a fuse to i*-*' Â¦

i fairs, so far as members 5f the House
Cooper declared he did not refer to
the Bristow report in his remarks. He
then further lauded Bristow., and said
he had worn himself out in the cause
of pure government and had received
as his reward vilification and abuse.
McCall demanded the previous ques
tion and his resolution was carried.
256 to 2, Lind (D.) of Minnesota and
Glllespie (D.) of Texas voting in the
negative.
The vote had the effect of sending
the Hay resolution to the select com
mittee named in the McCall resolu
tion, but does not provide for an in
vestigation of the Postoffice Depart
ment. .
.Ware of Mississippi offered a reso
lution for the appointment of a com
mittee of five House members to in
vestigate the Postofflce Department.
Payne demanded the regular order
and made an objection, which was
carried. . '
Adjourned.
The challenge was answered by
Cooper's colleague from Wisconsin,
Jenkins, who called attention to a
statement made on Wednesday that
the names of members had been as
sociated with that of "W. A. Machen,
a convicted felon on his way to the
penitentiary." Then shaking his
finger at Cooper, Jenkins said, amid
cheers: "You are the gentleman who
made the statement." * .
This matter has degenerated, as I
knew it would, into a covert attack on
the President of the United State's"
, This remark was met with derisive
laughter and hisses on the Democratic
side. Cooper defended Bristow and
said he never had attacked the House
of Representatives or any of its mem
bers. "Let any member rise and
prove to the contrary," he insisted.
CHALLENGE IS ANSWERED.
Cooper (R.) of Wisconsin vigor
ously assailed Calderhead of Kansas
for his remarks against Bristow and
insinuations against the r President
Cooper added:
Speaker Cannon then laid before the
House the committee recommendation
that the Hay resolution lay on the
table. By a viva voce vote the House
refused to table the resolution '
In passing on the question Speaker
Cannon said that the question before
the House "is a matter of such high
privilege, touching the dignity of the
House, of the integrity of members in
their representative capacity, that it
displaces all other business." He sus
tained the point of order against the
resolution. Griggs of Georgia appealed
from the decision of the chair. The ap
peal was laid on the table by a strict
party vote.
APPEAL LAID OX TABLE.
The entire membership of the House
wildly cheered. Speaker Cannon mean
time was vigorously rapping for order.
When cuiet was restored Smith said
there was not a bureau of the Govern
ment that showed proper respect for
the direct representatives of the people.
Smith's time had expired, whereupon
Clayton ot Alabama, amid shouts of
approval, moved that Smith be given
thirty minutes to conclude.
"I object," shouted Overstreet in the
midst of the uproar. Overstreet then
asked for a continuation of the debate
for three days. Overstreet. failed to se
cure an extenson of the debate.
McCall of Massachusetts argued that
the state of the public mind With re
spect to the Postoffice Department was
such that when a whisper was mado
by any one in connection with postal
affairs that whisper reverberated from
one end of the country to the other.
He opposed a general investigation at
this time.
The recommendation of the commit
tee to lay the Hay resolution? on the
table was read. Moon proposed a sub
stitute providing for the investigation
of the entire Postofflce Department by
a committee of five House members.
Against this Overstreet raised a point
of order. Williams said that an in
vestigation of the- Postoffice Depart
ment apparently was not desired, "be
cause it has been thought best for the
Republican party."
Addressing the Republican side, he
said: "The country knows, the world
knows and you know that you have
the power and the right, upon an ap
peal from the decision of the chair, to
make it in order. Are you going to do
it or not?"
Swanson of Virginia insisted that
every member of the House, whether
he was mentioned in the report or not,
owed it to' himself to insist on the full
est investigation of .the Postoffice De
partment.
William Alden Smith of Michigan
said: "I denounce this report as a vol
untary and gratuitous insult by a great
executive department of this GoVern
ment." It had gone out of its way to
keep facts back which should have been
given. He then threw the House into
wild excitement. Men of the highest
character, he declared, had been as
sailed by the report, among them the
Speaker of the House. "I hope,'' he
said, his words being almost drowned
by the cheering and handclapping with
which his remarks were received on
both sides of the House and in the gal
leries, "that the day is not far distant
when with the general consent of the
American people the Speaker will bo
lifted into the executive office." .

undersigned proprietors of that wonderful
remedy hereby do, to pay the sÂ«m of $500

the cure of woman's peculiar ailments is

no other medicine for woman's ills is pos^
sessed of the unparalleled curative prop-
erties that would warrant its manufacturers

which is backed by those willing to forfeit

POSTUM I
POSTUM CEREAL.-Admiral Makaroff has infused ericrsy into the Port Arthur squadron. A reconnoissance by Russian
torpedo-boats brought on a. sharp fight "with the Japanese mosquito fleet supported by cTnisers. Each side
lost torpedo-boats. The Russian admiral dashed ont with two cruisers to cover the retreat of his tor
pedo squadron, but found himself outnumbered. The .fact that the admiral steamed out to the rescue
with but two small unprotected cruisers may indicate that his heavy ships had not steam up or they were
too badly crippled to move. , _._" â¢ .
Definite news from Seoul, evidently forwarded by steamer to Chefn and cabled from there, indi
cates that the Japanese army is not yet ready for an advance in force. Its ran is at Pingyang strength
ening fortifications and troops are being ; hnrried to that point as they land.
Cossack outposts are sprinkled through Northern Korea observing the Japanese advance. The Mik
ado's forces are evidently establishing" fortilied bases on both sides of the peninsula, accumulating: stores,
building railroads and providing for all contingencies before advancing and offering battle.
A possible movement toward Vladivostok, as well as one in the direction of Wiju, is outlined.
Bennett Burlcigh's dispatch from Chemulpo shows that he continues to expect an Invasion of the.
Liaotung Peninsula or a descent on the Manciiurian coast from the Japanese 'base on the islands of the
Blonde 'and Elliott groups. â¢ , ;. *,
- Commander Sawyer's reported protest against an attempt. to block the port of Xewchwang and thus
imprison his ship (a United States gunboat) was discussed at a Cabinet meeting at Washington. No com
munication from . Commander Sawyer on the subject has reached Washington. The administration would
indorse such a protest if one has been made under the circumstances related.
SUMMARY OF THE CALL'S WAR NEWS
"Port Arthur was invested by sea on
March 10. The Japanese displayed an
especially noteworthy determination in
keeping up the bombardment 'of our
forts from 10 a. m. until 1 p. m. The
town .suffered little damage.
"The enemy's ships in great force
followed three divisions, among which
were distributed nine armored ships.
Each division was accompanied by a
flotilla of torpedo-boats. The Russians
did not fire one-tenth as many sheila
as did the Japanese. There was no
panic or excitement among the civilians
of Port Arthur and s the troops kept
cool."

bor Captain Rodman, U. S. N., has
given some interesting testimony con
cerning that naval station. Captain
Rodman leaves to-day to Join the
American fleet in Asiatic waters and
his testimony was taken prior to his
departure. His opinion of the harbor
is not very flattering.
The naval expert states that the
channel Is too tortuous for large ves
sels to make an entry unassisted by
tugs. He does not consider that any
vessel of the Oceanic Steamship Com
pany or other large trans-Pacific liners
that now come to Honolulu could enter
Pearl Harbor without a great deal of
difficulty and danger, and ho wouid
consider It hazardous for a saiiing ves
sel of more than 500 tons displacement
to enter the harbor. In his opinion it
will take approximately half a "million
dollars to oi>en Pearl Harbor to com
merce.

Refugees from Xewchwang, this cor
respondent continues, report that the
Japanese are landing at a small bay on
Liaotung Peninsula.
The Tientsin correspondent of the
Standard reports that influential Chi
nese living in the United States have
telegraphed to the Chinese Foreign
Board urging that the Emperor be
made head of the army and that China
join Japan against Russia. The Chi
nese In question* offer to raise the funds
necessary.
The Russian force on the Talu River
now amounts to 20,000 men. As an ex
ample of the power of the Japanese
"Shimosef" powder a correspondent of
the Standard at Tokio relates that a
Russian sailor who was hurt In the na
val flght off Chemulpo and taken to
Japan has 160 wounds.
Dispatch boats began to run on
Wednesday between Chemulpo and
Chinampo. The correspondent says
also that a torpedo boat destroyer and
a transport are aground off Chemulpo.
The destroyer is slightly damaged and
the transport is wrecked.
Cabling from Yinkow, a correspond
ent of the Mail says the British and
American gunboats at Newchwang
have orders to leave as soon as the Liao
P.iver opens. At Liaoyang there are
now 12,000 troops working night and
day on fortifications. A great fortified
camp is forming south, extending three
miles in every direction.
LONDON. March 12.â A correspond
ent of the Daily Telegraph at Seoul de
scribes the recent Japanese attacks on
Port Arthur es "successful preparatory
bombardments," thereby intimating
that a greater attempt to reduce Port
Arthur is thought imminent.
The official announcement from
Mukden that the Russian army corps
which has arrived at Harbin will be
held because of the landing of Jap
anese troops at different points is re
garded as an unintentional tribute
from Viceroy Alexieff to Japan's suc
cess in mystifying the enemy as to
her movements.
A correspondent at Chefu of the
Mail gives alleged information of the
Japanese landing movements up to
March 8 and says that disembarkation
is proceeding at Chemulpo and points
to the northward with marvelous
rapidity. During the last ten days
sixteen transports have landed 10.000
men at a town the Japanese call

navigation is made dangerous by rocks
and shoals. Four Japanese cruisers and
a number of torpedo-boats guard the
mouth of this channel. The danger
even of free approach to It is proved
by the fact that to the north of the
channel's entrance a torpedorboat de
stroyer and transport are aground. The
destroyer is slightly damaged, but the
transport is a complete wreck, having
been broken in half.
Captain Paynter was formerly in
the British navy. He resigned his
commission, but some time ago was
placed on the reserve list t When the
Admiralty learned of the mission he
had undertaken for Japan his resig
nation from the service was asked
for, a step, Captain Paynter says, that
the British authorities were compelled
to take for political reasons. Captain
Paynter is" a veteran of the Egyptian
war of 18 82. He recently delivered a
state barge to the Sultan of Turkey
and for . this service was tlecorated
with the Order of Medijdeh. Cap
tain â¢ Paynter has a photograph of
himself arriving at Yokohama, which
he expects to sell for a large sum to
the English papers. .
The cruisers were to have coale*d at
Suez, but the presence in the canal
of some Russian war vessels causeu
Captains Paynter and Hill to change
their minds, and Port Said was se
lected as a coaling station. Nothing
more was seen of the Russian squad
ron, which included five destroyers,
the cruiser Aurora and the battleship

Emperor's gifts included a pair of

; If -> the senior students of , : tne ' Uni
versity of California have- anything to
say about it there will be no repetition
on Charter day this year of the rush
between the sophomores and freshmen
that took so much of the dignity out
of Charter day last year. Following
the lead set by Professor C. L. Cory,
chairman of the Students' Affairs
Committee, who announced last night
that expulsion from the university
would follow participation, in a rush,
the seniors met to-day and passed the
following resolutions unanimously:
"Resolved, That the men of the
senior class hereby' pledge themselves
to exercise their good offices to pre
vent a rush between the sophomore
and freshmen classes on Charter day."
In order to further safeguard the
traditions of the day and to prevent
their being mauled to death by two
warring classes, the class " men then
commissioned a committee of five
to wait on- the officers of the
Junior class and negotiate for their
co-operation to' keep the factions
apart. This committee is composed of
Philip Carey (chairman). J. W. Geary.
A. A. Ro3enshine, Samuel Stow and
Max Thelen. This committee is also
instructed to mediate between the
leaders of the two lower classes and
endeavor to prevail upon them to
pacify their predilection for fight.
The Charter day rush and the after
math of last year still live in the^em
ory of the students. In spite of warn
ing the "3ophs" and the "freshies" got
together on Charter day night and
proceeded to tic each other up in bun
dles. The result was the dismissal of
.three upper class men who had abet
ted the affair. One of them was sub
sequently reinstated.
In order to avoid any misunder
standing this year as to the nature of
the punishment. to be meted put to any
that participated in a rush, .-prominent
seniors prevailed upon Professor Cory
to make a statement warning students
that they would* be expelled for the of
fense. In the past the Students* Af
fairs Committee has refused to pre
scribe what would be punishable. The
committee merely stated that it ex
pected the students "to act like gentler
men." But this was too indefinite al
together for the seniors, and they re
fused to act with the faculty until a
definite ruling was made. Now the
students know what they may expect
if they rush.

T. C. Lane, the one-armed brakeman
that was arrested a week ago at the
Oakland mole .for threatening Assist
ant Division Superintendent A.- W.
Baker with a pistol, is again in jail,
charged by W. S. Palmer with having
threatened his life. Lane was allowed
to go on th/? first charge placed against
him on the condition that he leave the
city. He went away for a week, but
came back last night, when he was
taken into custody by Railway Detec
tive Mahoriey. His bond was fixed at
J5000.
Lane says that he came back to Oak
land to get his clothes. He had been
at Stockton and had been promised
work and came back intending to go
out d town again this morning. He
asserts he had not been at his home
two hours when he was arrested.
Palmer's charge refers to the same
attack for which Lane was first ar
rested. He was under the influence of
liquor and. said he would shoot every
cne in the office. The railway people
say that Lane got drunk up at Stock
ton and said he was coming back to
Oakland and clean out the office of the
<!ivi.Â«ion superintendent.

"Alway* considerable in" length, the
tail was directed almost exactly away
from the sun. The main tali widens out
after leaving the head, and on most of
the; plates divides into two distinct
branches. There is a marked contrast
in the appearance of the primary tall
on the negatives taken fn July and
those taken in August. The tail on the
July plates Is smooth and continuous,
while on the August plates It is twisted
and full of condensations. Indicating
greatly increased activity as the comet
approached perihelion.^
"The \ other tall Is short . and -very
much curved, and presents practically
the same appearance on ail the nega
tives. It is bright even. on'the plates of

Borrtlly. the grtnu- French astrono
mer, first discovered the comet on June
21 last while he was taking observa
tions at MarseilkR. The next day it
was "nicked up" by th*Â» scientists at

ments studied until it disappeared on
August n. In the meantime Mr. Al
brecht employeti th* tim<Â» photograph
ing the visitor, thirty-sue negatives in
all having been exposed.
On each nlate there is a very distinct
imÂ»ge of the comet at various points
of its flight across the ski#s. At first it
shows faintly, but continue* to grow in
brightness until the middle of July,
when it begins to recede and grow
fainter again. In taking the photo
graphs Mr. Albrecht adjusted the cam
era so that it followed exactly the
movement* of the comet. This accounts
for. the white lines running across the
pictures, which are nothing more nor
less than the images of stars that did
not move as rapidly as the comet, and
thns left a trail of light upon the plate.
"The photographs show two distinct
types of tails throughout the observa
tions," Mr. Albrecht says. 'The princU
pal tail is long and straight in 'its' "gen
eral direction, and in a number, of case?
can be trac^ to the very edge of the
plate, amounting ip astronomical meas
urement to ten degrees. It developed
some Interesting forms, changing its
aspect completely from^day to day.

W. J. " Yore : and â¢ his brother John
passed last evening at 573 Telegraph
avenue, where the Davitts are making
their home. The evening was spent in
a discussion of the question that is in
teresting them, and they expect that
the "matter will be, settled in a day or
two.
No, I tcld my friends when I was here be
fore that I would do no more talking, and I
will stick to It. I want ' to stay in Oakland
long enough to get feeling well and then I
want to hurry back to New York. As soon as
my bock Is finished I will go from there di
rectly home 'to Ireland. I have been out of
politics for some time and Intend to remain
out.
Really, though, there is very little to squab
ble over. Mrs. Canning gave four- fifths of
her property to her friends and advisers be
fore she ever made a will, and by the time
the lawyers and expenses are -paid there will
be very little of the ' balance left. I am In
hepe, however, that the matter will be amica
bly settled out of court and shall exert what
inHuencc I have to this end.
Asked in regard. to whether he would
make any speeches while here, he said:
LlTTIiE FOR SQUABBLE.
I am really In Oakland for my health. If I
had not been sick I should not have taken the
trip across the continent. 1 nine to America
to have my book published. Harper Bros, are
getting it out for me In New York and I should
be there now. I received two bundles of proofs
to-day. I am very much Interested In the
work to which I have devoted a great deal of
my time.
The bock Is on the subject of the land ques
tion 1n Ireland. It Is a review of this ques
tion for the last fifty years, but In reality goes
back two hundred years. It is called "The
Fall of Feudalism In Ireland." It Is a ques
tion to which I have devoted mest of my life.
As to the matter of the settlement of Mrs.
Canning's estate I cannot say that It Is not
my affair. I have nothing at all to do with It
and am only Interested In it In so far as It is
my wife who Is one of the lielrs. It is her
money and I have nothing at all to do with It.
In speaking of the matter of the
esuÂ«e last night Mr. Davitt, in an In
terview, said:
In this dilemma she . wrote to her
husband in New York for his advice,
and the proceedings in the matter have
been delayed pending his arrival here.
He said last night that he hoped to be
on . his way back to New York in a
week ami that Mrs. Davitt would prob
ably accompany him.
OAKLAND. March 11. â Michael
Davitt, the Irish patriot, arrived in
Oakland this evening from Xew York.
It is expected by those interested in the
settlement of the estate of the late Mrs.
Mary Canning that his presence here
win aid materially .in a peaceable so
lution of the strained state of affairs
"brought about by deceased having dis
inherited her nephew, W. J. Yore. A
few years ago her es'tate was thought
to be worth $500,000, but when her will
was filed for probate recently it was
found that there was less than JSO.000
left. " â¢
Mrs. Davitt was a niece of Mrs. Can
ning, and last Christmas the first
named was given a present of $30,000
by Mrs. .Canning", When the contents
of the will were lhade Known it. was
found Â¦ that Mrs. Davitt had been
further remembered by being made
heir to half of Mrs. Canning's estate.
Her arrival here two weeks ago is" a
direct result of the proceedings nece's
sary to the settlement" of the' estate.
The threatened contest over the will
of Mrs. Canning by Wj J. and John M.
Tore, Mrs. Davitt's brothers, put her
in tho position of having to side with
them and- against Archbishop Rlordan,
who is made the heir to the other half
of Mrs.- Canning's estate, or against
her own brothers.

months- ago, while* she was serving
salads and other epicurean dainties in

his rooms for alleged threats against
his spouse, who had sued him for a di
vorce. The reputed capitalist put up
$500 in greenbacks for his appearance in
court. Page did not appear -in court,
and Police Judge Mortimer Smith made
sothe orders that forced the situation
to a crisis. After the arrest Mrs. Page,
afraid of the notoriety a. trial; in

dragged because Judge Smith , rflused
to dismiss It, until Mrs. Page. "to-day

A distressing story of misfortune is
that of the last days Â«of 'Joseph- R.
Michaels, the electrician who commit
ted, suicide on Thursday morning by
inhaling gas at the lodging-house at
121 Powell street. A master of a well
paid trade, he had been thrown out of
work by sickness and later refused em
ployment because his shattered frame
promised but slight ability to earn a
day's pay. For five months he had
tramped the streets in search of occu
pation. In that time he had obtained
employment for less than four weeks
and at the most miserable -wages. Â¦
Michaels ,' came to California four
years ago Â¦ from' Altpona, Pa. He had
been earning as high as $100 a week
in his vocation, ; but his health failing
he sought â¢ a milder climate. For ; a
time he prospered, finding employment,
first as electrician and engineer at the
Waldeck Sanatorium, then with the
San Francisco Fixture Company at 1061
Mission" street and- later as manager
of the Pacific Grove branch of A. R.
Haskins' 'Kearny-street establishment.
Haskins . failed j in i November last, and
Just then Michaels became ill. When
at ' last able to get outdoors : he waa
but a shadow of his former, self, and
the employers to whom he applied for
work laughed at* him. He eagerly
sought - any employment.- For two
weeks he was at waiter at the Meredith
Hotel onTurk street,. and later did odd
jobs at a lodging-hou*e on Sutter
street. '._ Even these temporary make
shifts failed him at last. . â¢
Michaels' had two invalid woman rel
atives dependent Apon his, earnings.
One is Mrs.' Hattie, M. Godden, his aunt,'
formerly head; cook at " : the Meredith
Hotel 'and ; later/ housekeeper Â¦"_ at the
Berkshire! Hotel), but now confined to
her bed by. illness. The other is Mrs.
Alice Wright, the widowed daughter
of Mrs. Godden." During the last weeks
of his life his greatest anxiety was to
earn enough to , provide food and lodg
ing for these 'helpless women. At last
they \vere compelled to leave "their
rooms on Turk street and take" a
single small; room ,;af 610 ,0'Farrell
street.- Here -the three destitute rela
tives [ made shift . to eke out a miser

The banker is very anxious that
American feeling should be friendly to
ward Japan. [ He was here five years
ago and has manv friends in New
York. As next to the head official of
Japan's greatest banking* institution,
TakahashVis an important man in the
financial world. He, is making a tour
of the agencies connected with his
bank, a duty, he performs every five
years.
The third of the Japanese trio is Cap
tain M. Asaoka of the Japanese navy.'
He Is on his way. to London to suoer
lntcrd the construction of a battleship
now being built for 'the -Mikado's navy.
He is the essence of affability, but. like
a gocd naval officer, refuses to discuss
profttsional matter*.
High in the councils of his native
land and acquainted with the plans of
the Japanese campaign, the Baron will
not discuss the. war beyond expressing
the conviction that Japan in the pres
ent conflict will justify her claim to
recognition as a world" power.
Banker Takahashi says that the
.whipping of the bear will be easy. So
confident did Japan feel, he said, that
plie had placed no restriction upon the
emigration of her young men, and "you
see," heÂ«aid, pointing to the crowd of
coolies on the Siberia's forward deck,
"the stream. Is still flowing, toward
America. We have all the men we
need, and if we want more we have
them in Japan. When they are gone
those you see on this ship and most of
those now settled in the United States
will answer the Emperor's c^Jl."
here yesterday on the liner Siberia. One
represents, the nobility of the island
empire, another her financial strength
and the third the naval arm that Rus
sia is finding so strong and active. \, At
this time of Japan's great trial of her
carefully nursed strength considerable
interest attaches to this trio, represent
ing as it does the fiber of which.' new
Japan is "made.
Baron K. Kaneko, K. Takahashi and
Captain* M. Asaoka are the names of
these passing visitors.
Baron Kaneko is a graduate of Har
vard University, which seat of learning
conferred upon him the degree of LL.D.
He is president of the American and
Japanese Friendly Society, an organiza
tion whose mission is the promotion of
good feeling between the two nations.
Making friends for Japan in the United
States is said to be chiefly the object of
the -Baron's visit, although yesterday
he was too tired, he said, to do any
missionary work. He is a life member
of the House of Peers and a former
member of "the Cabinet, in which he.
held the portfolio of Agriculture .arid
Commerce. He is on I his way to St.
Louis, he said yesterday, to confer with
the Japanese commissioners to the ex
position.
Three distinguished Japanese 'arrived
VALLEJO. March 11. â Two prisoners named
Harris and Walsh, who had been temporarily
confined in the hospital on Mare Island, made
their escape last niirht and, presumably
through the assistance of confederates, secured
boats and made their way to this Bide.
Special precautions are being taken
to prevent bloodshed' and several
Chinamen of the xival tongs have been
relieved of their guns.
â¢The Ping Kongs demand a sum of
$750 for the heads of members lost in
the Walnut Grove war over and above
the number of heads secured by them.
Their demand has so far met with a
flat refusal on the part of the "Buey
Duns, and another battle for heads is
imminent.
For the last few days the Chinese
Six Companies has been acting as an
arbitration board, but its efforts at
patching up the trouble have been
fruitless.
The prospects of another bloody high
binder, war in Chinatown are very fa
vorable. The Ping Kong Tong and the
Suey Duns are about to even up old
scores. The Ping Kongs have not got
over the Walnut Grove war, when they
were worsted by their rival tong. After
the trouble at Walnut Grove a few
months ago- a truce was patched up
between the flshting tongs. The. truce
was to last over Chinese New. Tear,
when a final settlement was to be ef
fected. The Xew Year season is over,
but there is little prospect of a peace
able settlement. i 1 *-

protection against mildew and thrip3.
The method used is the sulphur bellovw,
which is so constructed that the oper

cess, thereby saving a large percentage.
There is a receptacle . on top of the
bellow? proper which Is filled with pow
dered sulphur. A tube passes from tha
bellows through the sulphur to the Ud.
This tube has a cap which has four
long holes cut in it and Is kept on the
tube by a little brass spring. When
forcing air through, the tube lifts the
cap up to the holes and forc*es the pow
dered sulphur out of the discharge

type is midway between the Esquimau

WE are in receipt of very earnest but very tem
perate comments in Tulare County papers upon
our statement of the effect of the court's charge
to the jury in the case of the State vs. Janes, for the
murder of Martin, the City Marshal of Tulare. Janes
was . guilty, of a misdemeanor^iri obstructing the side
walk, contrary to a- valid ordinance of the. city govern
ment. When taken into custody he shot and killed the
City Marshal, and, we suppose, ".was acquitted under- the
Judge's charge- to the jury, w^ich carried the principle of
self-defense into resistance, of - an- officer. The press of
the county spreads all of the instructions given by the
court in reply to our comments and puts the burden on"
the jury, which, was judge . of the facts. ' s All that we
desired to- do was to admonish courts.'of .the exceed
ing danger there is -in introducing the doctrine of self
defense to justify resistance of arrest by an officer.
While the instructions in the Tulare case may have
been balanced evenly, and were no doubt given con
scientiously by the court, their tendency is to carry the
doctrine of self-defense, into an action where it -has no
right to. go. If the arresting officer â¢ make an J.unpjQ-.

Nearly all the edibles shipped to the
mining camps about Nome during the
early days of the gold fever came in
the x shape of canned goods. Thereby
hangs this tale.
An arrival "at one of the camps
stopped at a roadhouse for a few days
until he could decide in what portion
of the country he would stake his'
claim. Among the. baggage he brought
with him was a phonograph, probably
the first one ever seen in that country.
A crowd of curious Esquimaux stood
;by looking in amazement at the ma
â¢chine. The visitor, thinking the in
strument might cause them some
amusement, started it going. The na
tives stood looking at one another in

until one fellow volunteered that he
had discovered what It was.

PURE WINE LABELSâ C. J. M..

but it is a sort of dead letter.
Some absolutely new observations about the "Hand
That Rocks the Cradle" are presented with a circle of
photographs that are. at once as fascinating as they are
original. Spring novelties in dress are shown in a full
page of photographs on a page directly opposite this.
Equally notable are the photographs of the snow cov
ered foreign buildings at the St. Louis Exposition, while
in the line of pure fiction and high-class literature by
world famous writers there are several excellent features
to choose from.
First might most properly be mentioned the third in
stallment of Geraldine Bonner's strong California 'novel,
which, though it is fresh from the, press of the pub
lishers, has already created a great furor, so great in
deed that the Sunday Call paid $1000 for the exclusive
Western rights to reproduce it complet.e in five or six
installments. The three pages in the next Sunday Call
tell of Mariposa's rehearsal in the Grand Opera-house
on Mission street in San Francisco, and bring more
complications in the remarkable mixed relationship,
which, notwithstanding it is so thrilling, Miss Bonner
is said to have taken direct from life, and end with
Mariposa's first heart-breaking disillusionment with life
and love. ..'-._ -â¢' â¢ â¢ , \'- ii}-^-
Next there is "The Wave That Gave Back Its Prey,"
the first of a series of six original sea stories by Albert
Sonnichsen, the young California author, who is just now
the literary., idol of New York. Â¦ ' . .
- In competition with this is : Jack London's story of
"The Great Interrogation," wherein the author presents
a problem qfi primitive 'love in the frozen north that is
as painful in its heart interest "as it is fascinating.
Add to all this. the "Recollections "of and ReHections'on
Abraham Lincoln," by Thomas Fitch; the "Early Spring
Sowing of Books," a record of individual opinion -and
criticism, by Robert W. Ritchie; "The Japanese Red
Cross in the Far Eastern* War," illustrated with photo

PICTORIAI.LY the Sunday Call of to-morrow will
be a notable and pleasing example of modern art
in journalism. On the first page of the first sec
tion of the magazine is a full page photograph of Miss
Lillian Spencer as a dainty, Winsome, mystic Geisha girl,
reproduced in multiple colors. Both the pose and the
manner of its presentation are absolutely unique, while
on the first page of the" second section of the magazine
is a splendid collection of four photographs, including
one half life size portrait of the second and only other
prize baby on the Pacific Coast. The history of these
photographs, as well as of the baby herself, is truly
romantic. Indeed, nothing could be more, interesting
than a comparison of this beautiful child with the first
California prize baby, whose pictures were published in
the Sunday Call last Sunday. Both of these front pages
are designed particularly as mural decorations for those
who delight to save and .display" good art work when
shown in novel and fascinating subjects.
Among a series of interesting stories on a page of
"Tithely Topics" is an article that gives a vivid descrip
tion of the excitement that has been created on the
London Stock Exchange by the Russo-Japanese war. It
needs only one glance . at the photograph â¢ that accom
panies this article to >. realize - how all the rest of the
world throbs violently when this remarkable artery of
finance misses even a single pulse beat.
On the. same page is an" article telling what strange
discoveries were made about "fire-proof" safes after the
recent big Baltimore fire, and how the manufacturers are
coping with the "burglar-proof" problem.
The exhibition of wild animals at the St. Louis
World's Fair, which will reveal the very .limit of ingen

Answers to Queries.
Joseph. E. Smith, Mormon, of many wives and more
children, protests that the Congress of the United. States
is impertinent and impudently inquisitive in seeking to
inquire into the private affairs of his families. When one
has five wives and forty-two children it is difficult to
conceive how f he ; can construe their affairs as private.
They r^aise themselves to the dignify of a community
and become, as it were, offensively public.
Into the bottom of the trunk place
all these boxes. As they are tightly
filled they may be turned in any way
most convenient with their angles.
Fill interstices where sides do not
come squarely with paper or hosiers',
or anything to make things firm.
The second tray should be devoted
to dresses and waiets. If one has an
elaborate wardrobe she naturally
would carry a wardrobe trunk. In
packing one's dresses it is still well to
remember thtt the closer they lie the
smoother they will be when they come
out. Fold skirts from the top,
doubling them on the gores and mak
ing certxiin that they are smooth as
folded.- By laying the skirt on a bed
the cloth may be smoothed with the
hand Â«o that no wrinkles are folded
into IL If there are plaits or folds
heed must be given to them, and the
cloth folded to favor them. After the
ekirt is folded lengthwise it should be
doubled once in the middle and placed
in the tray with this fold at the end
of the trunk. That leaves the foot of
the Â«kirt in the middle of the trunk.
The second skirt Is placed so its fold
comes at the other end of the trunk.
This leaves more space in the middle
tray for waists. Very fancy waists
may be stuffed with tissue paper, but
Â¦waists and dresses of that kind should
not bÂ«Â» carried in an ordinary trunk-
Very few persons fill their sleeves with
tissue paper when packing. Usually It
For bric-a-brac F%wdust is better
than excelsior, because it will fit snug
ger, but it Is not to be preferred for
large pieces on account of its weight,
and also because they do not need as
close packing as the smaller articles.
The experienced packer attends to
all this preliminary packing before be
ginning on the trunk. The art in the
whole business lies in having the small
and frail things safely prepared to
stand the jarring and upsetting that is
before them. The burden of the task
comes in these things, and if one is
not strong it is well to take them a
day before the remainder of the pack
ing is done.
To make small space hold much
bear in mind that each box put in the
trunk should hold something, still
carrying out the principle of close
packing. Ribbons and all the femi
nine trinkets should be put where they
will fili otherwise empty spaces. It
does not harm them and does save
them. The rule is as good if one is
packing masculine notions as femi-
There is no family in this restless
country which has not at some time
to struggle with the moving question
and its difficulty of packing so that
"three removes" shall not be "as bad
as a fire." Even among those for
tunates who live in one house all
their lives there 'will "be at some time
a necessity for moving goods and
chattels if only for a sumnier at the
beach, and then those who avoid all
these troubles have trbnks to pack.
No one escapes that.
The whole art of packing well may
be summed up in a few words. It is
this â pack closely. There will never
be breakages when goods are packed
80 tightly that they cannot shake or
move about. The writer, having been
born under a wandering star, has
learned the uncertainties of packing,
and how to circumvent them bv much
experience, and now can pack jars of
preserves and dozens of eggs to be
tarried in an ordinary trunk with per
fect safety, much to the surprise of
kind friends, who say: 'I shall love
to have you take them, but you never
can get them there without breaking."
As packing trunks comes more fre
quently to ordinary mortals than
packing furniture, it may be well to
begin with that for the fln=t lesson.
Nearly all trunks nowadays have two
trays, which is much more conven
ient. Into the bottom of the trunk
should be placed all of the heaviest
things, books, boxes, etc., and as even
ly as possible. Frail articles never
should be packed without being spe
cially wrapped so that if they were
dropped they would be whole after
they struck the floor. For very deli
cate things wrapping in clothing is not
enough. This is good as .far is it
goes, but it does not protect enough.
Crumpled newspapers of soft quality
are better, but best are wisps of hay
If that is to be had, and if not then
excelsior. This must be used gener
ously and the article rolled in it un
til nothing can be seen or felt of its
original condition. When the due
amount of soft wrapping has been
used wrap all in paper or some cloth.
No bottle thus treated will break. It
won't break even if dropped on the
floor before it gets into the trunk.
If one is carrying anything as easily
broken as eggshells or eggshell china
!t may.be taken with perfect safety by
placing it in a box considerably larger
than itself, first covering the bottom of
the box with sawdust. As many
articles may be placed herein as there
is space for wfthout touching each
other. After these have been placed
add more sawdust, every now and then
6haking the box to make the sawdust
pack closely. It is not -possible to
pack by hand as compactly as it will
by shaking â something one will no
tice in a trunk after she has traveled
for a while. This is the' method the
v liter tested when she brought eggs
from Maine to New York without
cracking one.

"Don't be In a hurry," said the Sena

This time there was no mistake about
it and the recipient of this pair of
stinging awakeners mixed matters with
his assailant. At least he started with
that purpose, but as he struck his first
wild "blow another fist landed on hi*
jaw and sent him to the deck with
starlight in his eyes. Just as he started
to get up a tall, big- boned, black-faced
mate strode toward him. A huge black
hand, heavy as a ham and greasier,
was slapped across his face and the
towering bulk of the sable sailor ruler
descended not too gently upon the
prone figure. '
Sitting on the new member of the
crew and punctuating his words with
more slaos of the ham-like hand the
mate remarked:
"No roush house here, matey. This
is an orderly ship. Go for'ard and be
good or I'll hit you."
Right behind the ear and from a
direction which suggested that his sup
posed friend had administered the blow.

himself alongside a whaler, her flecks
bustling with signs of an early depart

hesitated about crossing the gangplank.
"Go on. Don't make a fool of your
self," said his conductor, giving him
a little physical assistance shlpward.
"Not for me. That's a whaler. You
don't shanghai this chicken. I'm wise,
I am."
As he spoke he had been crowded
across the plank and his declaration
of independence was finished on the
whaler's deck.

Every lynching produces a crop of criticism of the
law and the courts. If the matter is examined it will
be/ found that laxity lies with the juries.) They are
drawn from and represent the body of the people. They
are the representatives of the community in the-, ad
ministration of the law and are the sole judges of the
facts. They are not always carefully selected, but no
doubt Judges and attorneys do as. well as they can." Yet
sometimes relatives of the person on trial get on juries,
and in one case in this State the man who committed
the crime for which another was on trial was a member
of the jury and succeeded in having the innocent man
acquitted. It is plain that if critics of the courts will
look into cases in which justice fails they will find juries,
that is to say, the people themselves, to blame.
In the Ohio lynching appeared another matter for
serious reflection. The cheerful mob which murdered
the negro was foJlowed by an incendiary mob that was
not on. pleasure bent. It fired. the negro quarter of 1 the
town and prevented the Fire Department from going to
the rescue until the; conflagration had done .its work.
The excuse for this act was that the negro quarter was
the shelter of idleness, vice and crime. .
. That_ is_ a serious matter. The Northern born and
raised negrp is noted for his industr3'. thrift and law
abiding spirit. Where negro ' quarters are found in
towns along the Ohio River and elsewhere in the North
they are built up by negro immigrants from the South.
If they: are a menace to community life there is raised
an issue that will not* be decided by burning men at
the stake nor putting the torch to roofs that shelter
women and children. . Jt is an issue that is of interest
to the North. and South, and a problem that they must
work but hand in hand. This must be done by elevating
the negro, not in the: slUshy sentimental sense in which
that term is used, but by^rnaking him a wholesome. factor
in the practical affairs of! the country. .
Booker Washington' sees this issue clearly, and as
clearly states its solution at which he is toiling. Teach
ing the calculus and the catechism will not bring light
into the negro quarters, North or South^ Seeing the
effect of idleness on the white youth of the North, we
should know that neither ethics nor religion can wjth
'stand idleness. Teaching the negro how to work and
make himself sought for his skill and his industry is
the only solution, if there be any.- Booker Washington
is frank in stating the shortcomings of his race and
that is the main source of. his.; power. When a race
and its leaders conclude that.it is perfect and resent
caricature of'its qualities and its follies, there is no hope
for that race. :The professional negroes who attack
Washington and his gospel of work and clean living are
worse enemies of the, negro than the white men who
burn him at the stake. Others should be encouraged
to follow the example and take * up the work of the
founder of Tuskegee. An institution like it in Ohio may
make unnecessary, the purification of negro quarters by
fire.
Our missionary energies are -spent at a long range.
We spend millions in China and Africa and keep, our
Government embroiled . by interference with the civil
institutions of other countries. Why should we spend
millions every year in trying , to solve problems and
mend morals and -manners in ..other countries while we
have this problem on hand at-home? If all the zeal that
is put into making a few doubtful converts to a Chris
tianity that they don't comprehend were put into train
ing negro workers like Washington, to go among their
race in the negro quarters of the North and -the black
belts of the South, to teach the gospel of skill, work,
economy, property, cleanliness and decency, we are of
opinion that mankind would get more benefit than is
gained in carrying the gospel abroad to. people who'
don't want it. .
It is said that in the recent Ohio lynching- there was
a spirit of admonition to* the officers of the law. Whijo
it is but little satisfaction to the fellow who is lynched,
to know that he is merely used as a means of discipline
to men in office, perhaps that 'was the- motive of (the
mob. It is said that many homicides have occurred''in
that county recently 'and juries have been" lax in punish
ing the guilty. Under such circumstances it Would seem
more effective to hang a few jurymen. Instead of this
being done, it is probable that members of 4he slack
juries were in the mob, helping it to do murder" and
cheering the good shots.
LYNCHING, even of negroes for i murder, is not
sectional as between North and -South. In. the
South a majority, of the victims are black, while
in the t North a majority 1 are white, but Northern com
munities enjoy lynching a negro as much as any in the
South. The recent mob in. Ohio had all; the characteris
tics of mobs everywhere, but is reported to 'have been
more enthusiastically cheerful- than sucli .'crowds.^usually
are. The good shots, at the victim were cheered, and
there was a picnic air" abroad that relieved the gloom
of the proceeding. This differs from the Southern way.
Down there the shadow of a solemn duty is cast over
a lynching, and men go to it grimly andi without;" a
smile. So, it may be said that in the North lynching
is an amusement and in the South a ceremony; J \

Furniture well packed will bear much
freighting without getting scratched or ;
marred, and If it is well wrapped it is j
ready for the man who will crate < it. >
Each crate should be numbered so that \
it may be seen at once what It was j
made for. It may serve many times if ;
taken care of and if one is likely to
move often.
When an artic'f is expensive and
cannc-t be packed In barrel or box, but
must be cralec". by itself, it will be
much safer to crate tt so that it shows
what it is, for then it is handled care
fully. A large Japanese vase was
crated without any cover," care being
taken that no part of its surface was
even with the outside of the crate, and
it has taken two long trips without the j
slightest harm. The handlers, seeing 1
its worth and beauty, lifted it -instead
of throwing it, as they otherwise would
have dc-ne. It was crated as carefully
as possible, but not wrapped. * i
The only safe way of carrying pic
tures is to have a case made for them
so that each. touches nothing else, but
if one does not care to do this,' there
is reasonable safety in putting them
in a big box, first wrapping each sep
arately in papers and then placing lay
ers of excelsior, or hay, which is softer,
between them. Under any measure of
decent treatment there should be no i
trouble with them if thus packed. j
There is a very decided difference in |
the bill for freightage if advantage is
taken of all these spaces, and it Is quite J
as well to make the most of them as !
to waste one's money on needless boxes
and crates, which all add to the ex
pense of shipping. '
In shipping furniture it is very neces
sary to~wrap it so that it will not be
scratched, for one who sends goods by
freight is always prepared to assert
that no care is taken, in hattdlinfTi it*
whether that is true or not, so it is
well to prepare for the worsL Every
particle of woodwork should be cov
ered with papers and then with burlap
over everything. This is beside the
crates which are made for. the wrapped
articles.

By no means empty the drawers. On
the t contrary Jill every one. Many
kitchen supplies if properly wrapped
may be thus carried. A two-foot statu- j
ette was safely packed between the j
four legs of an old-fashioned sewing i
table, which had to be crated. There
was ample space for the statuette,
which went wrapped in quilts under
paper and burlaps. â¢ ...
The upper tray remains for hats and
anything else. Most trunks have boxes
for hats, but' where there are none it
is easy to make the hats safe by tying
them in with tape. It is a' simple mat
ter to catch the tapes where wanted
by means of small tacks.
Boots should be thoroughly dusted
before packing, and then, being in good
order, should be wrapped in cloth bags.
This protects them and makes it safe
to place them in any part of the trunk.
There Is nothing more hurt by pack
ing than books. Even with the best of
rare their backs will wear off and their
bindings loosen. One who loves books
well will put corners of each cover into
protecting triangles, which any book
dealer should be able to provjde, and If
each book is wrapped in "manfla paper
that willalso prevent much of the wear
and injury. If one has a large library
by all means have boxes made of a size
to hold books of the same height. When
one is packing he is quite likely to wish
that ail books were of a bigness ex
ternally, for it is very difficult to make
500 books of varying length' and thick
ness lie together smoothly, as they
must or have crumpled leaves.
When it comes to packing furniture
the method followed by the profes
sional is quite different from that of
the amateur, naturally enough, as the
professional has no interest in lessening
the weight and the corresponding
freight rates. Crating most things is
necessary and will be found an econ
omy In the. saving of wear on the goods,
but two chairs may be boxed seat to
seat and thus save something. Unless
one puts the whole thing in the hands
of a professional it will be necessary to
get everything ready for boxing. Chairs
may be placed as stated, separating
them by papers, .and in the squares
made "by the legs may be packed bed
ding, sofa pillows, anything of that
nature, and over all there must be a
layer of paper and then one of burlap,
made tight. This protects the- furniture
and its contents.

r If the arresting officer had shown a weapon and
threatened its use in such way as to put his prisoner jn
peril,, from which there was no escape except by .killing
'the officer first, the element of self-defense was properly
in the case and the instruction was right. But, lacking
these ;.facts, such an instruction was outside the testi

they murder the officers' who execute it.

J HONOLULU, March 5.â An appeal
has been taken by the Attorney Gen
eral's Department from a decision ren
dered by Judge Gear that Oahu Prison
is' a penitentiary. This appeal is im
portant in order to settle whether It is
necessary to keep the Grand Jury in
continuous session throughout terms of
the Circuit Court for the indictment of
all sorts of petty offenders. Judge
Gear held that imprisonment in Oahu
Jail is an infamous punishment and
that indictments are therefore re
quired in all cases where the defend
ants are liable to such imprisonment.
This decision was on a petition for a
writ of habeas corpus, which the Su
preme Court has held to be appealable
by the Territory.'

DENVER, March 11.â A petition' for
divorce filed in the District Court of
Big Horn County, Wyoming, January
9 last by Colonel W. F. Cody ("Buffalo

complaint' charges cruelty and alleges
that on December 26. 1900, Mrs. <â¢ Cody
attempted to poison the plaintiff] An

asks a decree is that the marital rela

The remnant of Robert Lane's brain
Master Zanich was positive that the
eg? struck him and woefully bespat
tered .his Sunday Jacket, but he could
not conscientiouslj' say that he saw
the missile hurled. He and the other
church-going boy were so deeply en
gaged in their discussion of the sermon
that the arrival of the egg came as
a complete shock, and when they
sought to discover the source of its
flight they saw Harry McCarthy and
Roy Griggs and the unknown little
boy sitting in a buggy and laughing
heartily at them. So they concluded
that the egg had been hurled from the
buggy, but from whose hand it had
flown they could not exactly determine.
The defendants earnestly and af
frightedly pleaded not guilty, and the
court averted an avalanche of "char
acter testimony" fey continuing the
case for a month.
Bad little boys and good little boys
from Alabama street were numerous
yesterday in % the court of Cabaniss,
trhere Harry McCarthy, Roy Griggs
and another little boy. name unknown,
Ftood accused of breaking the last
Sabbath and the peace by casting an
egg of uncertain age at C. Zanich and
another little boy. name not disclosed,
as the latter were returning from
church and discussing the doctrinal
discourse with which they had been re
galed. Several adult relatives of the
little boys were also present as guar
dians or witnesses.
It was infatuation of the man for the
â¢woman that led to the arrest of An
drew C. Love, a private in the Coast
Artillery, and his arraignment yester
day before Judge Conlan on a charge of
threatening to kill Lena Lucas, a
dancer in an Eddy street temple of
t^rpsichore. And in this case, too, re
luctance to prosecute will probably re
pult in acquittal, for the woman did
not appear in court at all.
According to the tales \o\& by Miss
Lucas to witnesses Love met her while
phe was plying her vocation, and after
tripping a few measures with her he
gave her his heart. But there was no
reciprocal affection, although the sol
dif-r pressed his suit with ardor. When
unable to visit the object of his adora
tion he deluged the mails^with epistles
to her. in which assurances of his im
perishable love alternated with solemn
threats to slay her and hUnself if she
did rwt respond to his petition. These
amatory and intimidatory missires ut
terly failed of intended effect, how
ever. Lena continued to treat Andrew
as a brother only, despite the glamour
of his brass button*. â¢ until his love be
came adulterated with anger. Then, at
8 p. m. on March S. he visited her
apartment and pitilessly cut one of her
best gowns to ribbons. That aroused
her. She sought police aid and he was
arrested.
Just 'why Miss Lucas failed to ap
pear to prosecute was not disclosed
in court, but about a dozen sons of
Mars were there to prove an alibi for
the defendant. They swore that at the
time of the alleged gown-mutilation
Love was at the Presidio; that he re
tired to his bunk at 10 o'clock p. m..
and remained there until reveille, and
that he has always been of good char
acter since he became a soldier. Among
those who 60 testified were Lieutenant
Victor C. Lewis. Sergeant R. P. Coe
and a number of Love's comrades.
The case was continued till to-day,
when the woman probably will be in
court.
In the court of Judge Fritz yesterday
it came to light that Mrs. Fritag had
hinted to Akers her desire that he ob
tain employment and earn enough
money to defray their Joint current ex
l*?ntejÂ«, as her capital was limited and
rapidly dwindling. . Instead of accept
ing the suggestion in the considerate
spirit that prompted It, Akers vio
lently assaulted the woman, grabbed
her purse and left the room. She in
formed the police of her loss, and a few
hours later they found Akers in her
apartment and apparently on most
friendly terms with her. In one of his
rockets was the stolen purse, and only
a few dollars of the cash had been
spent by the man. He was taken into
custody despite the woman's protest
that she had forgiven his offense, and
in court yesterday the infatuateh crea
ture showed such reluctance to testify
against him that the prosecuting attor
ney had the case continued.
Mrs. Fritag is a pretty woman about
23 years of age, and Akers Is a big,
strapping fellow. When asked if he
had caused the breaking of her home
in Fresno Mrs. Fritag smiled bitterly
and replied, "Well. I guess he did."
Akers does not seem to be much wor
ried over h!s plight.
Mrs. Elizabeth Fritag was dwelling
In amity with her husband, Michael, a
saloon-keeper at Fresno, when Stone
r^s" Akers, a cement worker, entered
their bone 83 a boarder and alienated
her effectlons. The husband soon as
certained the situation and philosophic
ally made the best of it Instead of
either pleading or shooting, he disposed
of his business, gave his wife $1000 and
quietly disappeared. With the money
and her paramour Mrs, Fritag came to
San Francisco, and the couple were at
the Winchester Hotel last Thursday
when the man waÂ« arrested on the
woman's complaint that he had robbed
her of bank papers worth $350 and
cash to the amount of $44 40.
In, Judge Conlan's courts there were
three charges against Barney Smithr-
Judge Mocan increased to $4000 the
bond of John Hamilton, charged with
having fired two pistol bullets through
the glass door of John Larsen's dwell
ing, 3684 Eighteenth street, on the
evening of March 7. Hamilton's wife
had left him and cone to live. at .the
home of Larsen, who is her brother-in
law, and Hamilton followed her while
he was intoxicated. After being eject-'
ed from the house by Larsen, Hamil
ton fired the shots. The amount of his
bond was increased because, since his
arrest* he threatens to kill his wife
as soon as he can find. opportunity to
do so. Testimony for the defense will
be heard next Monday.
Haneen appeared with his head
swathed in bandages. He is a diminu
tive Scandinavian sailor, and Foley
and Brown are strapping big follows,
yet they confessed they could only sub
due the pugnacious little chap by club
bing his cranium.. Mrs. Hansen show
ed no physical evidence of the rough
usage to which she alleged the police
men had subjected her.
Mrs. Hansen was severely scored by
the Judge for her fiat denial of every
allegation made by the complaining
policemen. She swore that she had
never tasted Intoxicating liquors in her
life, that she had not interfered with
the officers when they arrested her
husband, and that one of them had
wantonly knocked her down. When
shown a blue coat ripped from collar
to tail she swore that she had not torn
it, although the policemen swore as
positively that she did.
"I don't believe your testimony,"
said the Judge to the woman. "In fact
I believe that you have deliberately
committed perjury. Your husband
seems to have been less to blame for
resisting the officers than you were,
for when he showed a willingness to
yield vou urged him to fight."
low you to call your witnesses now."
The attorney said he would defer
calling witnesses until to-day, when he
will present them to obtain mitigation
of sentence.
Judge Mogan decided that August
Hansen and his "wife Lizzie disturbed
the peace of Welch street last Sunday
and also assaulted and battered Po
licemen Foley and Brown, as alleged
by those officers, and postponed sen
tence till to-day. Whereupon Attorney
Walter Gallagher entered vigorous pro
test, hinting that the defendants had
not been given opportunity to produce
witnesses to substantiate their denial
of the charges, and expressing regret
that he had not moved for a Jury trial.
"Well, I will suspend proceedings and
allow you to have a jury trial," said
the Judge, "or, if you prefer, I will al-
John Muir proved possession of a
very unreliable memory when he testi
fied before Judge Mogan. He could
not remember anything about having
eaten and refused to pay for a meal
in a Fourth-street restaurant, nor had
he any recollection whatever of hav
ing aimed a blow .at the restaurateur's
nose and smashed a window instead;
but his mind was perfectly clear on
the point that when arrested he had
$15 in his pocket, whereas only $4 75
was entered to his credit on the City
Prison register. At the conclusion of
his recital of what he had remembered
to forget, or had forgotten to remem
ber, John Muir dramatically pointed
the index finger of his right hand at
Police Officer Flood, who had run him
in, and exclaimed, "Where is my
money?"
"John, your case is continued until
you can get some of the kinks out of
your tangled memory," said the court.
Medora Ford, of tan complexion, is
held in Judge Mogan's court for con
ducting an opium den at 2& Hinckley
alley, and Leopold Campus, of muddy
visage, stands accused of being an in
mate of the place. Police Corporal
Fryer and Officer Morton testified that
they raided the house, and' that Me
dora held them at bay by keeping the
door shut until several white women
escaped through the rear windows.
When they finally obtained entrance
they found only Mr. Campus, who was
too heavily laden with dope to effect
a rapid retreat. The internal atmos
phere was almost stifling, the police
men said, and a complete opium smok
ing layout was found and seized. Me
dora and Leopold will be sentenced to
day.
Kittle Ford and May Johnson treated
their arrest for vagrancy as a joke
until Judge Conlan sentenced them to
three months' imprisonment. Then Kit
tie screamed' and swooned and May
shed many 'tears.
The women grave bail for their ap
pearance in court yesterday, and while
waiting there they chatted and laughed
and occasionally retired for liquid re
freshments- They were on, one of these
excursions when their case was called
and when they returned their bail had
been forfeited. In Ignorance of w*rat
had happened during tlieir absence
they resumed their seats among the
spectators and were giggling at each
other, when the eye of the court lighted
upon them and they were called to
the front. It< was the apparent con
tempt in which they held the law and
its tribunal that probably prompted the
Judge to hand them such a heavy pun
ishment.
Miss Ford's swoon was succeeded by
an exhibition of hysterics that had not
concluded when she entered the eleva
tor and was hoisted to the "tanks."
Miss Johnson's grief, although less
demonstrative, was undoubtedly as
deep seated as that of Miss Ford.
was clogged with opium fumes when
he entered the Suey Keh restaurant,
In Bartlett alley, and picked up four
small china dishes which his distorted
fancy had transformed into golden
double eagles. Whistles were blown,
of course, and the responding . police
man found the four little dishes .in
Robert's possession. â¢ , * .
"I took them for a josh," said Robert
to Judge Mogan.
"Which proves that, your mind is in
need of renovation," retorted the Judge.
"To-morrow I'll prescribe the rest cure
for it."

Though seven clubs elected delegates
last year to the California Cricket As

nave any matches arranged for it and
the only event provided for the Lake
County cricketers was a visit to that
county during the Independence day
holidays. It was not found possible to
make up a team of city cricketers for
the /trip, which was abandoned. The
schedule, therefore, provided for only
four clubs, Alameda. Pacific ani
Can Francisco County being set down
for twelve matches each and the Santa
Cruz team for six. The schedule con

San Francisco County against Santa
Cruz at Alameda on September 13, did
not take place. This year the cricket

names of Herbert V. Keeling of the
Lakeport Club, T. W. Beakbane of the
Burns Valley Club and J. Wilson Rob

retained, because they are the lead

OFFICIALS WARN
THE LEASHMEN
The committee claims that Baker
and Variel were holdins back the sin
gles and for that reason defaulted the
college player. As. good players are
rather scarce in the tournaments it
is poor policy to default men like
Variel. The default of Variel has ac
complished nothing, as 'the singles
will be "completed no sooner than if
he had been allowed to play to-day.
The tournament otherwise have been
well managed and the mistake of de
faulting Variel is evidently due to poor
judgment and a desire to finish the
tournament as soon as possible.
That the singles will be won by
either Murdock or Baker ia almost
a certainty. Murdock is in good form
and is figured by the majority to beat
Baker. The latter, however, is a
steady player and consequently a dan
gerous opponent.
In doubles only one match was
played last week. In v it Heath and
Gorrill beat Parr arid Foster In
straight sets. The score was 6-4. 6-2.
Other matches could have been play
ed, but as the weather was rather un
certain most of .the players did not
appear. In the consolation ' singles
Gayncss beat Ames 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. Me-
Duffle had one set on Foster and the
rains make it difficult to accomplish
much on the tennis courts and for this
reason there has been but little tourn
ament Dlay in the last few weeks.
From now on there will" be fewer
rainy days and the tennis club will en
deavor to catch ud with their sched
ules. By playing between showers the
Oakland clubs have their champion
ship singles down almost to the "fin
als and, will probably finish both the
doubles and singles to-morrow, If the
weather is good. The consolation
singles will be played- at the same
time. Sixteen names were drawn in
this event, and so far only' one match
in it has been completed.
In the lower half of' the singles
Percy Murdock has won a place in the
finals. He defeated Norman Ambrose
in the semi-finals last Saturday after
noon. Ambrose made a good showing
in the first set, but the second was
one-sided. The score in Murdock's
favor was 7-3, 6-1. Ambrose had
previously beaten Otis In straight
sets. The score was 6-2. 6-1.
In the upper half Robert Variel de
faulted tj George Baker. Baker won
the first set from Gorrill 6-1. The
rain put a stop to further play, but
Baker is almost sure to win the next
set. Charles Dunlap will . meet the
winner of the Baker-Gorrill match in
the semi-finals. Baker and Dunlap
should furnish an Interesting match
to-morrow morning. While Baker .is
a strong favorite, Dunlap is considered
by many to have a chance.
The action of the tournament com
mittee in defaulting Variel to Baker
has been criticized by many, who con
sider that Variel has not been treated
fairly. The latter beat Drummond
MacGavin, one of the strongest play
ers entered, and undoubtedly had an
excellent chance to win the champion
ship. He was out. of town Saturday
and Sunday, but would have been able
to play this afternoon. Variel was not
defaulted until late Sunday afternoon
and considering the wet weather the
match might easily have been post
poned.

again in the race for \ the position at
the first corner. Blake '04, Matthews
'06 and Stott '07 are also being tried
for the place and it is anopen question
as to who will prove the winner. In
the fields Chalmers '07, Knight '04,
Moore '05 and Sales '05 are the most
promising candidates. The latter is
also making a good showing in the
box and may possibly get into one or
more of the Intercollegiate games in
that position. The men who seem to
have their positions cinched are: Cap

games and Stanford has won one.. . One

At the regular monthly meeting of
the Sketch Club, which was held yes
terday afternoon at the club head
quarters on California street, an ex
tremely interesting address was made
by Miss Hyde on 'Japanese Art."
Hiss Hyde, who has recently com
pleted a tour Japan and who dur
ing: her sojourn in that country was
greatly taken by the artistic charac
teristics of the Japanese people, said
yesterday that Japan is the only coun
try o? the world m which reaJ live art
exists. In part she said:
In Jawa ihÂ« children are taught, from Um
' tlire oÂ£ t^cir b.rUi. tÂ» appreciate art ajid to

it than destroy It. And so it Â«s throughout ail
of J&?an. The childr-n arÂ» raised to !ovÂ« art
aad all things beautiful, and for that reason
the country u far above all others frcra an
artistic standpoint.
At the conclusion of her remarks
Miss Hyde exhibited several paintings
and screens that she had brought
"from Japaa. the workmanship of
which is delicate and beautiful. A
vote of thanks was tendered the
speaker fbr the knowledge she had
imparted on a subject of which many
are ignorant.
Miss Agnes Murphy, who was the
guest of honor at the meeting, was ln
troduced by Mrs. Long-, the president
of the club. Mi3s Murphy made a few
remarks on the subject of art and
stated that with the assistance of Miaa
Moore she had organized the flrsc
sketch club in Australia. The club
was organized twelve years ago and
is now of great importance, having
turned out several of the most re
nowned artists of the modern salon.
Miss Murphy, who was a close friend
of the late Phil May, told several
amusing little anecdotes of him that
t were received with great langhter.
Phil May ran away from school at
the age of 12. she said. He never took
a drawing lesson in his life, but waa
acknowledged to be one of the great
est artists in his line of work that tht
world has ever known. He never took;
a music lesson in his life, bat could
play and sing the most difficult com
positions. He never wonld study, but
could quote Shakespeare throughout;
and was a linguist, being able ta
speak four or five languages.
Miss Murphy was loudly applauded
at the conclusion of her Interesting;
remarks and awarded a vote of trta w>^
by Mrs. Long, president of the dub,
on behalf of the members.

Captain Forsee was struck and
knocked down by H. M. Donaldson
while ordering Jockey Frank Reed
from the betting ring yesterday. Reed,
while being shoved along to stimulate

the Pinkerton official threw the boy
down. For his foolish act he was ruled

Thursday night, and will be ridden by
Jimmy Boland. Pinkerton cleaned. up
everything at the southern meeting
with the exception of Belle Kinney and
when beaten by that filly was. conced

that he thinks Amy J a high class
filly and win rely on the daughter of

possess the advantage of having Bull

the favorite, but saved no ground on
the turn and later was edged over the
ridge. This of course. was a decided
disadvantage, and !n a 'â¢Â¦Â¦fierce drive
Light of Day earned the decision. Nine
to one was the closing quotation about
the winner. Johnny Daly managed to
keep Golden Idol. from running out and
downed Edgecliff for the show. .
MATT HOGAX A YVIXNER.
After a month's rest Billy Magrane's
Matt Hogan " came J out . fresh as Â«.
spring poppy, defeating" a' fair field of
sprinters in the third. John Bullman
had the mount on the old gelding and,
riding an excellent race, caught and
beat Pickaway our more than a length,
almost easily. -Willie Daly brought
Galanthus up In time to get the show.
Sol Lichtensteln.was indifferently han
dled by Holbrook* and never looked
dangerous. Â¦ f
Travers did not signally distinguish
himself by his piloting of Fille d'Or,
the S to 5 favorite for the mile and
an eighth selling run. He rated the
mare in behind the pacemakers. The
Fretter, Chickadee and Mr. Dingle,
when he could have taken the lead,
picked the deep going through the
stretch and was fortunate to finish
third. â¢ Bonner, with Chickadee, pass
ed The Fretter in the run home, win
ning in a hard drive by half a length.
J. T. Sheehan also succeeded in finding
all the deep footing for Prince Blazes
and while the old fellow had speed,
this handicap was too much and he
ran last.
George Miller's Decoy is certainly
a precarious betting proposition. The
gelding enjoyed, first call in the betting
on the last race and after Martin had
beaten the barrier with him he fin
ished second. The muddy going fitted
Billy Moore like a glove and well
handled by Bonner. he galloped in
first at KVz to 1. The show fell to
Isabellita.
The handball enthusiasts of the big
Western c!ub are making It possible for
the two athletes, both masters of the
famous old Irish game, to meet and
settle the question of supremacy.
CHICAGO. March 11.â Michael Z^aa,

San Francisco and gave' the enthu
siasts an opportunity to study his style
of play. He visited Kennedy's court

lungs in sood order. He agreed to stop
here on his way back from the coast
and will meet any two players which
may be pitted against him.

SUMMARY.
The Ascot cup, at two miles, will bt
run to-morrow. Weather unpleasant,
track heavy.
LOS ANGELES, March JJu-^There
were many ups;ts at Ascot tG^da'y; and
the talent sufferedvinyConseQaence, "of
them. The best race of the. day; was
the fourth, a free high weight handicap,'
and it resulted iri proving Fustian one
of the. gamest horses no w. racing here.,
Sais was the favorite- at" 7 io 5,-.wl(Ii
E. M. Brattain second, choice. : _ Fustlan.
was well supported at 4 to 1* and later;
at s. ' .-â¢>Â¦" ; - Â¦Â¦\-: 'Â¦
Fustian was left at the post- and.
when he got straightened out was ten
lengths behind , Brattain, the. leader.
He closed up the,, gap and turcing Into
the stretch was a length behind. ..Under
the vigorous riding of Lewis, he came
like a whirlwind and won by a short
nosa from Brattain. The finish was a,
thrilling one to the spectators. Colonel
Bogey" was third-v and the favorite
fourth. The track was heavy, but Fus
tian's time wasrl:l5. a remarkable per
formance under the conditions.
Andrattus was the only winning fav
orite. Winnifreda was^played heavily
to win the last race, but ran poorly,
as did Platonius, favorite in the fifth
race. ;
Will Defend His Title Here
in the Fine Court of the
Olympic Athletic Club
Within three pounds of the stipulated
weight, ISO pounds, and within two
weeks of the date of the fight of his
life. Jimmy Britt is already in fine
fettle, and his mentor. Spider Kelly,
says that if the Californian is not ie-'
clared the victor in the coming contest
it wi!l be because Young' Corbett is his
superior at the game of punch and
block.
Britt U a willing and a conscientious
worker and. being gifted with a mental
makeup far superior to that of the
average pugilist, profits readily by his
own experience and the ad
vice given him by others. It is
his dally custom to hold a secret cau
cus with Trainer Kelly after he has
< ompleted his physical labors to discuss
the tactics he is to pursue in battle on
the 2sth of this month. These will not
N? revealed to any others than his
seconds until the strife is on.
For lid minutes yesterday afternoon
Jlrr.my went through as much continu
es muscular exertion as could be dis
played in the fiercest of twenty-round
bouts. He skipped the rope, punched
the bag. wrestled with husky Frar.k
Rafael, operated the wrist machine and
buried the medicine ball with Spider
Kelly without a minute's rest, and
when it was all over appeared as fast
as ever. After, undergoing a rubdown
at the hands of Kelly and Rafael. Britt
donned his fighting togs and went out-
Fide his pyir.n2.sium to pose for news
paper photographers. While the pic
ture men were snapping their ma
chines ihere was a stiff gale blowing
ar.d ir. the midst of the wind Britt ap
peared as Ajax defying the storm.
Jimmy was in the best of humor yes
terday and supremely confident. Among
those who visited his camp were Papa
James Britt, whom the little fighter
ramBlsrty *~a!!s "The Bos*," and big
Sam Eerper. Britt Is always glad to
?c-? hts friends and extends to each a
v.arm welcome.
Kir.g COPouefl are surprised at thÂ»
fitrerrf confJder.ce shown by the rival
boxers. That this is not simulated is
n-pll kr.ewr. and there will undoubted
ly be o&e surprised boxer in this city
alter frv- fiprfct is over.
Carbeit undoubtedly bases his esti
mate of Britt's ability on the latter's"
showing with Car.ole. The champion
sav." him f.Â£ht on this occasion and
thought there \rere weak points in
both his attack and his defense which
could be solved. Corbett goes down the
entire list of Britt's fights and picks
flaws in them. Britt Is equally adept
ir. this game and he convinces himself
that Corbett's list does not make a
record for him as a fire eater.
Britt did net think Corbett's showin?
with Dave Sullivan a brilliant one al
thouph it was apparent the champion
vat TK>t extending- himself once he had
his opponent in distress.
Confidence of the Rival Box
ers Causes Much Surprise
Among King Followers
Only One Favorite*; Scores,
Winnif reda and Platonius
Showing Very Poor Forni
past the is Made
â¢ The monthly boxing show which the
Lincoln Club promoted at Mechanics'
Pavilion annex last night produced a
fair . quantity, .-of. excitement, for the
bouts. _ln many instances were rough,
uncouth affairs, full of slugging and,
wild, windmill-like i punching, that made J
the crowd rise. at times and emit yells;
and shouts of praise. j
Many of the \ star performers knew J
the ganft only in name and acted like,
tramps as soon as 'they got inside the ;
arena* -For Instance, Georpe Braun, j
who mixed it with Teddy Wolffe in the i
main scrap of. the night, fought like ai
kangaroo In the ring. After Wolffe had !
put him to the floor half a dozen times
in- the second round Referee Milton I
Hayes called the go off and gave Wolffe
the decision,.. .
Â¦Wolflte had his man under his wing
from the tap of the gong. Braun start- :
ed the mill with a lunge and a rush,:
but Wolffe met hlnr with a few we!l-i
placed right uprercuts and put him to.
the carpet In the initial mixup. The rest
of the fight was 'much the same. Braun
would rush in and receive a. wallop that
generally staggered him.- He did not
land once on Wolffe, and after he kept
going to the mat like a rubber ball in
the second round the referee -mercifully
put an end to the farce.
Joe Podesta and Charles Augustus.
two lightweights, furnished the best
bout of the night. They started to as
sail each other in the first round, and
the merry sound of wallops on the face
and body was kept up till Augustu3
was given the decision at the end of the
fourth. Both men were aggressive
and slugging was in order in every
round. Each scored several knock
downs, but they always came back
ready and willing to mix It. Augustu3
was the faster and the stronger, but
Podesta was foxy and game to the last.
Many thought the decision should have
been his, and the verdict of the Judges
was rewarded with a chorus of hisses.
Young McClure got the decision over
Mike McBride In a go that was as com
ical as it was exciting. They Just stood j
rip an dtwlsted their arms around and >
trusted to luck for the rest. The wal- [
lops generally landed and both men :
were groggy after the first round. ' '
Jim Linegar stopped Jack Hart in the ,
first round with an uppercut on the [
jaw as they were coming out of a
clinch.
Jim Bradshaw was given the decision
In his mixuj? with Frank "WUls, though
the latter outfought him at every point
of the battle and showed good form
for a youngster In his first bow before
a crowd.
Tony Rugguiro won a close decision
over Jack Bradshaw in the opening en
gagement of the evening.

"So Boas- indorsed the order and I

has since had to pay the money or

"This fellow wanted me to sell him
a 515 overcoat, offering a $50 money or
der in payment. We never cash checks
after banking hours, hence I refused.
But J. Boas. who. was standing near,
looked at the young man and his or

The fraud referred to by O'Connell
-was perpetrated by a young man de
scribed, by L. Summerfield of the firm
named as about the *ige and hc-Ight
Riven above for Rossier. Summerfield
last Eight told the story:
"Among Coggins' pupils was Eugene
J. Rossier. whom we believe to be the
head of the new gang of forgers now
at work hereabouts. -His age is about
height 5 feet 10 Inches, weight 165
or 175 pounds, hair dark brown, com
plexion dark, eyes dark and squinty.

professes to be a railroad man. He is
always cool and self-possessed. That
he has been in San Francisco vre are
not sure, but if not himself it was or.2
of his confederates that v:orktd the
scheme on J. Eoas, the mor.&y lender,
at Summerfleld's store last. Saturday
night.'-.
>. C LAUGH IS ON BOAS.
"Aiortimer was arrested in February.
1903. at Littleton, Colo., in company
with one Frank Hill. Coggins had
previously parted company with Mor
timer and was then operating in Ore
gon and Washington, where he, too,
was caught by the Inspectors in June,
last. All three' were convicted and are
now serving long terms. When Cor
gins gets out of prison at Salem he
will be tried on an indictment pending
against him at Seattle.
"Coggins had a number of 'pals'
while he was working his graft, and
when confined In the Portland Jail
awaiting trial he instructed other pro
fessional crooks in Its mysteries. It
was an easy matter for a brainy crook
to memorize Coggins 1 lessons as to the
chemical substances needed for the
work. The rest was simply common
forgery.
"Their method was to erase all the
writing on the orders. To do this they
used chemicals which completely ab
sorbed the writing ink without affecting
the printed matter. Then they filled out
the blanks anew for the larger amounts
and forged the names of the Postmas
ter and clerk at the office of issue.
"Thus equipped, they went to the
town on'whlch the forged money order
was drawn and offered It at some cloth
ing store in payment for a small pur
chase. If the merchant was not un
usually cautious he generally accepted
the order, paying the balance in cash.
The forgers always Avaited until after
the local postofflce had closed, when it
would be too late to get the order
cashed there. They thus had a ready
excuse for asking the merchant to cash
the order. Of course, the money order
would not be deposited by the mer
chant until the following day. By that
time the forgers would be far away.
INVENTORS CAUGI1T.
NEW THING IN FORGERY.
"About a year ago," he said, "J. C.
Coggins and William B. Mortimer
worked the coast towns very exten
sively on a new plan of money order
forgeries. They purchased a number
of orders in Pan Francisco. All were
for trifling sums, commonly 15 or 20
cents. The sole object of buying these
orders was to get possession of the
blanks, which they proceeded to raise
to sums ranging from $25 to $45, al
though some have been passed amount
ing to as high as $100.
The school of postofflce money order
forgers founded by the notorious J. C
Coggins, now an inmate of the Salem,
Or., penitentiary, has resumed opera
tions in this neighborhood. Uncle
Sam's postofllce inspectors are on the
watch for a man that cashed a forged
money order in a llarket street store
last Saturday night. This man is sup
posed to be one Eugene J. Rossier, a
former cellmate and pupil of. Coggins.
These facts briefly summarize one of
the most interesting chapters in the
work of the postal inspectors. The
story was told in detail last night by
James O'Connell, one of the local in
spectors.

SAN JOSE, March 11. â Who. re
ceived and what.became of , the $8OOO.
missing from the city treasury is the
absorbing question on the street. The
Police Department and the surety
companies' officials have been unable
to trace any large and lavish expendi
ture of money to McGeoghegan. The
Treasurer was in the habit of having
a great manyl friends hanging about
the office and lie would step out and
leave the vault-open in their presence.
McGeoghegan always had a crowd
around him and it Is this crowd that
the general public believe" spent
most of the city's money. The ex-"
Treasurer must, however, bear the re
sponsibility.
-Pending the receipt and filing of the
bond of the new Treasurer, H. D.
Mathews. the treasury is closed and
guarded by police. It ia expected that
the new Treasurer will have qualified
by to-morrow. . Expert Keane will at
once, as soon as the office is opened,
begin an exhaustive inquiry into the
accounts of the office and experts will
also be put to work by the surety
companies and McGeoghegan.
William Taaffe, who was the deputy
under McGeoghegan, has been under
police surveillance ever since the
shortage in the treasury has been
known. * The finding of a duplicate
key to the inner vault on his person
last night he explains by saying that
McGeoghegan told him to have it
made. The ex-Treasurer denies tell
ing Taaffe to have a key made. Taaffe
has made no attempt to conceal any
thing, but denies strenuously that he
took any of the city's ' money. It is
said that the police who have been
keeping watch over Taaffe will be dis
continued after v to-day. 1
McGeoghegan's friends feel confi
dent that they can raise, the entire
amount of the shortage and are now
at work j doing so. They claim that
offers of all kinds of financial help are
being received and that the surety
companies and the city will not lose
a cent. Whether McGeoghegan is
prosecuted or not, they claim that
every cent missing will be paid into
the treasury. .
A new Grand Jury meets next
month and it is almost certain the
matter will be taken up by that body.
The District Attorney's office, which
was represented at the Council meet
ing by two members yesterday, has
made no move and It is understood
that they will not until a more ex
tended report on the condition of the
treasury is obtained.
The general opinion around town is
that a conviction of McGeoghegan
would be a hard matter. He has de
nied all along that he took any of the
money and it would be hard to fasten
the guilt of stealing the city's money
on any one of the many people who
had access to the- cash. ..

SEW YORK, March 11.â The first hour's
tniElnrse to-day yielded almost as large a vol
vim of business ac the whole session of yester
day. The activity jiroraptly flattened out and
during the afternoon the market fell Into a
deeper elough of neglect. The early activity
Â«as the now- familiar end of the treek dis
counting of the !Â»'Â¦â Tlitntj of the handing down
cf the Northern Securities decision, -whJch has
been Just at rejrularly followed on Monday up
to this time by covering of ehorts and recovery
In prices. The proems* was not carried far to
day, probably because Northern Securities In
the curb market gave some evidence of support,
fount- degree of activity in the Etock failed to
SBatce any appreciable . irrcad on Its price.
Nothing Â«r!Â«? neeired to have any power to stir
prices. The Government's report, showing a
percentage of ihe Â»;rain crops remaining in
farmer?' hands somewhat lcse than the normal
for xh\f- time of the year. modlfW th*-suppo
sition that the *mall grain movement up to
this time ha? been due to large holding back
of stocks, which would ultimate!;* come out to
#w"cll the railroads' tonnage. The forecast of
th* week's currency movement was viewed
*-;th languid lnterert in view of the almoFt
I >k-Lborlc condition of the money market and
the indifferent demand for fund*. The email
Oe-<?rea*f in cash indicated is montly due to tne
ehipments of gold to South America. It is
nnÂ« commonly assumed that this operation Is
connected with t*ie purchase of war vcmteln bjr
JÂ«]>an frnin Argentina, the outgo of gold from
New York b*ir.K rather more than covered by
the lr.fictv ci Japane.se pold to 6an Francisco,
further mfgatau to thf latter port being now
elVoat. The niÂ«rkÂ»t closed easy.

Nrj> York Stock Market.
What with washouts and the bad condition
of country roads, the rtcelpts of Butter have
been considerably diminished during the past
severRl davs and the market for the moment
Is practically bare of strictly fine creamery.
Again, the companies operating the steam
schooners along - the northern coast are laying
off their vessels as fast as they come in owing
to their dispute with the engineers over the
wage and time scale, and this means of trans
portation Is being lost. But these conditions
are being largely offset by the prostration of
the telegraph lines, which prevent the recep
tion of orders from the northern coast, so the
net condition of the market remains about the
same.. The local trad* are not dl*r>oscd . to
charsc their customers an advance, as an accu
mulated suDnly will come in upon the market
just an soon aa the weather clears and railroad
transportation is restored. This la, the situation
In Butter at the moment. ' -
Cheese is lower a?aln and the market Is as
glutted with stock and weak as ever.
The situation In Eggs ' resembles . that In
Butter. Diminished receipts on account of In
terrupted transportation are offset by the in
ability to receive orders by telegraph and the
falling 1 off In the local demand on account of
the storm. It was reported yesterday that
some local houses had notified their buyers In
the country not to pay over 15c for storage
purposes under any circumstances. There are
plenty of Eggs In the country ready to be sent
Into market, and as.lt iÂ» a question' of only a
day or two when they will come In there Is no
disposition to ask higher prices just for this
brief .period.
Receipts were 41.000 lbn Butter, 1255 cases
Egps and 11,700 lbs Cheese.

Customs officials ran up against a

ing to lose 14 00 cash and SO. 000
pounds of unshelled peanuts rather
than pay 12, cents that he believed to
be an overcharge.
The invoice showed that the peanut
importation weighed SO, 000 pounds,
which. : at ; the . rate of half a cent a
pound, called for a duty of $400. This
sum. the Importer paid, but when the
customs people weighed the goobers
the scales showed 80,024 pounds,
which left a balance of 12 cents duty
due. The importer was indignant
when called upon- to pay the balance,
he contending that as the peanuts
were weighed here when it- was rain
ing, the excess of twenty-four pounds
was rain water, and domestic rain
water at that,' on which there could
be charged neither duty nor Internal
revenue tax. He threatened to take
an appeal to the board of general ap
praisers at New York, even though it
might cost him several hundred dol
lars, but the trouble was ended by his
broker paying the disputed' 12 cents
out of his own pocket.

ports of results in southern fields:

Company, operating on the'Careaga raneho. in
the 1-ios' Alamos ride of the- hUls ( ; secured -a
biR flow of oil from- well .No. 13, which had
been put down to a depth of 2750 feet. "As was
reported, thin â¢ well is capable â¢ of ; producing
about 1000 barrels of oil a day under the
pump, and the product la of higher -gravity
than that of any that has been . found In the
Northern Santa Barbara County field. The
company . had . Intended I to sink the well to a
depth of 4000 feet.
. In the area included in the Marlpona landa
which have, been, thrown' oped to settlement
are â¢ numerous gold-bearing veins and pocket
mines, the value of many of which can only
be determined by time. .Of course, many of.
these are known, but It' is improbable that
all of the veins, or deposits have been located
or discovered; and- the. experience, of the past
has shown that in such a region the mineral
industry is of greater value - to the ' country
than the product of agricultural pursuits.
Â¦.Indeed, in that particular .region the farms
increase or decrease In value with the rise and
fall of success In mining, for the entire county
Is dependent upon : . the .mines for supportâ
farmers and townspeople alike â for mining Is
the only support - of ' the region, which is too
far removed from other . markets to make agri
culture profitable. It is to be hoped that
when applications are made at; the land, office
the necessary steps .w.lll: be taken to determine
the character, of the. land before the applica
tion Is filed, and in this way expensive and
unnecessary Htleation averted. . -â Â¦
: The' mirilh& papers are'paying some
attention -to this matter, which i has
many features of interest. Speaking
of the Mariposa County lands that
have- been ' taken from the Yosemite
reserve,' the Mining and Scientific
Press; says:
While certain portions are undoubtedly val
uable as agrlcuIturaUland. unless extreme care
is. taken by the intending settler he is likely
to have his filing contested by mineral claim
ants. The" time *to" determine the character
of land is before filing is made by the agri
cultural applicant. The law excepts all land
"known" to " be mineral from Â¦ agricultural
entry, -when -such "land is. more valuable for
mineral than for agricultural purposes." This
Is. in. the very nature of things, while not
ambiguous; '.'. an', uncertain ."quahtlty/ 'for' the
mineral vein or deposit which Is unprofitable
to-day may be '.the paying mine ol the near
future. "' :
\lf there were, any .doubt^ at any time
that the water supply would insure a
long run - the . coming season , in all
parts of the mining country that. has
now been effectually dissipated. â¢ <"
Pending, the resumption of
tions to their fullest extent in this
State there are interesting topics to
engage -the mining men. .One of these
is found- in the withdrawal of portions
of .the Government's forest reserva
tions in California, especially where
the lands withdrawn from the forest
reservations ' include sections that are
principally known to be mineral lands
or are,; at least," oh the face of the
facts, reasonably entitled to.be styled
mineral rather than -agricultural in
character. When the forest reserve
sections - have' 'been withdrawn .'â¢" they
have ' been -thrown ,/opeh" to possible
agricultural uses. In >the. present sit
uation'there is ample opportunity for
controversies to' arise. It be un
derstood that when mineral lands are
included in . the forest reservations
they can \be operated notwithstanding
the Government tenure of the. reserve.
The withdrawals by the Government
in Northern California are quite large.
They amount -to 558,000. acres in'the
