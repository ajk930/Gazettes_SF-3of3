SEATTLE, Sept. IS.â Seattle has lost,
probably forever, the trade of Nome,
amounting annually to thousands of dol
lars. Headed by Dr. Cable Whitehead,
the merchants of Nome, backed by
moneyed nun, according to advices
reaching here to-day, are negotiating for
the establishment of a steamship line di
rect between Nome and San Francisco.
Whitehead is interested because of the
excessive cold rates charged by the
steamship companies running between Se
attle and Nome, and the merchants are
interested, they declare, "because Seattle
has had a cinch in times past and has
\u25a0worked it overtime." *:;-
One of the prominent- business men of
Nome, writing to a prominent jobber
here, cays, after detailing the boat
scheme:
"You would be surprised to see how
merchants here feel toward Seattle firms.
and as soon as a San Francisco line is
established I know positively that an Im
mense amount of business will be done
with San Francisco. Nome merchants
feel as though Seattle has had a cinch
during' the past few years and they have
\u25a0Â» criteria orc.'nprc f . we âfsd "al
though, we wanted to show Seattle that
we can do business on business principles
with San Francisco. The Seattle mer
chants will wake ui> some fine morning,

ST. . PETERSBURG. Sept. IS.â Emperor
Nicholas to-day, again appears before the
world aa a promoter of universal peace.
"With the Russo-Japanese war just ended.
and even before the peace treaty has oeen
ratified, his . Majesty has Issued Invita
tions to a second peace conXuence at The
Hague. â¢
That the Emperor has done so was
learned to-day from a source - which
leaves no shade on which doubt as to Its
authenticity may be based. It is an
nounced that the Russian '-= Government
purposes to address all the foreign pow
ers with a view to the holding of a second
conference at The Hague, but it is known
that negotiations preceding this announce
ment were entered into especially with
the. United States and \u0084w ere conducted'
with the greatest secrecy, there being not
the slightest inkling that Russia contem
plated anything of the kind. ".
\u25a0, The. news created the greatest surprise
here> and. that Russia -should plan a sec
ond conference, the steps ; already
'taken \u25a0by.- 'President / Roosevelt, was
learned , with â¢ amazement'' lt is clear that
J te .step .. could, not . be^ taken fc y ... RussU
"without first rrachiny a complete iUnder^
standing .with > President '> Roosevelt. , The
fact that' the President is reported as be
ing 'entirely in ' sympathy -.with the pro
posal, and that he is said to believe - that
to the initiator of, the first Hague.confer
ence .should belong the honor of convok
ing _ the - second, and reaoily and \u25a0 gladly
acceded -to the Russian \u25a0. proposition, 'la
clear proof, that the conference has been
called and that President Roosevelt re
linquished his part in it to the Emperor.
There Is strong reason to believe that the
news,. even If the intention of the Russian
Government, would not Â»â¢<*' given out un
less invitations had already been sent to
the powers and, i possibly, their answers
had been received. â¢ , .
-In this connection an interesting ques
tion arisAS as 10 how the invitation was
sent to Japan, in the lack of diplomatic
relations, , but the invitation may have
been delayed until such relations , have
been \u25a0 resumed, or it may : have " been : for
warded through the United States.
It was impossible to learn to-night tha
proposed date of the second conference,
or to gain even an approximate idea re
garding it. * but it probably will not be
greatly delayed. ' Russia, as the power
convoking the conference, probably will
submit an official - programme, the other
powers submitting suggestions. -

BLACKMAIL CASE
A LEGAL PUZZLE
Wai' Department Not to Act
Against Men Accused of
Trying to Hold Up Miners
JURISDICTION IN DOUBT
Two Californians Alleged to
Have Demanded Money of
Some Hydraulic Operators
Gpedil Dispatch to Tbt Call.
CALL. BUREAU. POST .BUILDING.
WASHINGTON. Sept. IS.â The details of
the alleged attempt to blackmail' certain
operators of hydraulic mines working un
der ' Jlcense* from tho California Debris
Commission have been reported to ihe
War Department. No action fey the de
partment will be taken and the case has
been olactd on tile. here.
The operators charge that George H.
Ma grader, said to be of Marysvillc, Cal.,'
and F. L. Neer of . Sutler County. Cal.,
threatened to serve upon, them a blanket
Injunction of a county court In California
unless they paid to Magruder and Neer
$500. The matter was reported to the
proper authorities in California, who,
after. aa investigation, decided that there
appeared to be no I'nlted States law un
der which Magruder and Neer could be
prosecuted.
Caytatn \V. TV. Harts. United States
Engineers, of San Francisco, to whom
the matter was reported, submitted to
Robert D. Derlin. United States Attorney
for the Northern District of California,
the alleged facts in the case, with the re
quest for aa DStlaloV whether Magruder
and Neer could be proceeded' against.
Attorney Devlin replied on August II
that after a full investigation he was un
able to find any United States law under
wlijch thejr could be successfully prose
cuted and suggested that Captain Harts
consult the District Attorney of the prop
er county as" to whether they had vio
lated any State law.
Tine affidavits of the or>erators, copies
of which are oa file in the War Depart
ment, allege that the operators were ap
proached by Magruder and Neer, who in
sisted that 500 had been promised them
for the protection of the miners against
injunction proceedings and demanded the
payment of that sum. The operators de
clare that they Oid not pay, but reported
the case to the authorities.
It is charged by the miners that Ma
gruder, en a visit to one of the mines, re
quested a secret interview with the ope
rator, to whom he said that unless paid
5500 he would serve on the operator an in
junction which would prevent the opera
tion of the mine: that if the money were
paid he would protect the miner from
further interference with his operations
whether they complied with the United
States law or not. and that it would not
be. necessary for the operator to build
darns or other restraining works for the
Debris Commission if the operator would
give Magruder the money the dams
would cost; thi;t Magruder handed the
operators a copy of an injunction which
h'e'&aid he would eerve, thereby prevent
ing further legal operation of the mine,
with the penalty of a $500 fine for con
tempt of court If the work were contin
ued unless the money were paid on the
clean-up. The operator promised to pay,
but has not done so.
Later, the operator ' declares, '-he met
Neer, who demanded the money promised
Magruder, but the operator refused to
pay. c afterward wrote to Magruder,
asking where he could meet him for the
purpose of paying him, and MagTuder
replied from Yuba City, naming the

EXPRESSES HIS- VIEWS AT RECEPTION AT THE ST. FRANCIS
Continued from Pose. 1, Col. 5.^
"I Introduce Governor Folk of Mis
souri," . said Governor Pardee, â¢ simply,
arid as* the ; honored guest stepped for
ward the men! and. women, in thq.assem
blage sprang to their feet, waved hand
kerchiefs and- bats and gave vÂ«nt to pro
longed cheers. On ton of this three cheers
were. given on suggestion of 'Mayor
Schmitz. . .
FOLK LIKES SAX ' FRANCISCO.
Mr. Folk put himself close to the hearts
of his hearers by telling ,themÂ»that he
and his party were' so impressed with the
beauties of California; and Sari
that he believed a law shoMld K be passed
compelling everr one in the ' country to
pay a vlslf to the Golden State. "It would
make every one a better American to
visit San Francisco and .California." he
said... "Tile, best thine- about, your .State.,
though, is your men and women, , ana
theyre^Just about the sajne here as in.
Missouri."
- Plunjrlnir into ."his main discourse, Mr.'
Folk said In part:
"Three"a"n"d a half" years ago a ban
quet was given in the city of St. Louis,
which \vns attended, by some of the,
leading business., men of that city. Af- j
ter the repast was over, the' bamlj
played "America;* nnd the audience j
stood and sang the familiar words. j
"As the last strains of the song i
died away. one of the men, with tears
of patriotic delight trickling down' his
checks, said: *Oh. that I could'dlefor
my counti"y!' Just thrÂ«e weeks after j
that this man was cringing at the f eet ]
of Justice, confessing that he had bribed
an entire municipal assembly to pass a
railroad franchise bill. He was willing
to die. for his country, but he had not
been willing to live for his country.
He aspired. to be a patriot of war, and
lie 'was a traitor of peace. This man
was but a type.
"He who lives for his country may
be as true a patriot as he who dies for
It..' 'Patriotism -does not abide alone in
the roar of cannon, and the din and
clash of arms, but in the everyday
duties of civic life. There may be as I
much patriotism in the ballot as in the j
bullet. â¢ The patriotism of peace is even.,
more necessary than the patriotism of j
war, for history shows that where, one :
government has been destroyed by
wars, pestilences and all other calami
ties combined, corruption has under
mined a score.
"The greatest obstacle in the way of
good government, the. greatest, hin
drance to the progress of righteousness,
is the Inactivity of good citizens. The
country needs men In times of peace
even more than. in war. When good
citizens disregard their obligations to
their country they leave control to un
desirable elements. These demand of
those elected that they be served even
if the nubile 'interests: suffer. - If 'an
official refuses to prostitute his. trust
he.ia put under the ban of their dls ;
approval and forever, after that dis
barred from holding public officer-that
is if these elements have their way
about; it. and they . generally d 0.,; But
once in. a while the whirlwind of an
indignant people sweeps them aside for
a time. Tne strength of the lawless
13 great, but it is as nothing when t
comes in contact with, an aroused
conscience. ..", % ".i ' - ai - \u25a0 '
"What has been done in SL Louis,
what is being d6ne in Philadelphia,- can
be done anywhere. The^ people ctm
overthrow . civic evils whenever they
want to. and can get just as good gov
ernment;>â¢_ they .deserve,- or ".bad as
they DVjnlt.it to become. .There is
hardly, a community. h>; this country
where the. law-abiding, people .are not ;
to Xhe majbrlty. A. dozen
.can make more noise, ibousfa., than . 500 .
law-abiding citizens, but they do .not
count for much against the united ef
forts of the law-abiding. Lawbreakers
curse and swear and bulldoze but
they are cowards, and if resolutely
fought kn. be overcome. They, are
always active, however, while the
average good citizen becomes active
Sly Seasonally. They surround an
offldal and sing to him the siren song
of the good politics of serving them in
?ead of the public. Unless the^ official
be strong he will be led astray by their
afluriS promises. As a matter of fact.
whÃnev-er the lawless have strength in
poiiUcs it is because of the default of
the. law abiding. . .
"When the good people get a good
man in office they do not stand by him
as ihe evil stand by the bad man hey
get .in office. .but _when the law-abiding
get a man in office too often they are
the first to criticize him and leave him
to fight the battle without their active
aid That is the trouble.- Good men are
divided and bad men are united. If
good citizens could only be induced to
join hands in 'patriotic endeavor before
the election and'stay joined- after the
election the forces of error could be
vanquished like evil spirits at the dawn
of day. * -
"Government Is good in proportion

letter. _ Up -.to ; that; time-for the fifty
years 'preceding there had only 'been
about thirty-four, cases of bribery re
ported inuhe books in all the United
ritates. 'Not because the offense was
uncommon, but because.it was uncom
mon for officials to be prosecuted for
it,: When the prosecutions were com-;
menced in St. Louis, the members of
the .House of pelegates denounced- the
bribery law as a 'blue law,' and'as.a
dead law, because, it "had"' not been "en
forced before. They argued that mem
bers'of "the" House of Delegates, having
been, taking, bribes ,from.:time imme
morial, they had acquired a right to
do so, } and it '.was, just as. proper for
them to sell their votes as for a/mer
chant to".s"ell his wares. When -the
revelations came. and the people', saw
how they had' been -plundered,- and
realized that- a government by bribery
wasa government by, the. wealth of the
"few" and not by the people, they
caw the offense In all of its enormity, and
from one end of the. land to the other
I there was a civic awakening.
; "Brilliancy and wit in legislators are
1 well enough," but common every-day" hon
esty Is much better. Unless spirit of
civic rightepusness dies out we. will
soon pass from the commercial age into
the age of high ideals { from evil to good,
and from darkness into light. The ambi
tion of young men' should not be so;much
to get rich as to get right and stay right.
IIO.VESTY BEST POLITICS.
"Political parties are beginning to learn
that honesty is not only the best policy,
but the best politics.. The people will no
"longer resound to. the sounding brass of
mere party names, but a party ._ must
stand for something and : mean ' some
thing.. Corrupt men used -to hide behind
the \u25a0 party dress, and whenever attacked
would . crj' but. the party was being as
sailed, A rascal is a rascal whether he.
calls himself a Democrat or a KepuiiUcan;
a lawbreaker is a criminal â¢no matter
what party he may belong to. If there be
any difference made by reason of party 1
should say prosecute the Democrat who
does wrong Hrst because he should krtow
better. " Under our forms of government
political parties, are necessarj't for It is
through them .that., men; come t6: an
agreement on political questions and an
nounce their principles and intentions, but
political parties should be ;the' servant *of
the people, not* their masters. -Any man
who puts party interest above the welfare
of his State is a traitor to his State.
Partisanship is. a good thing sometimes,
but patriotism is a better thing all the
time., " ' .
"With an executive official. the question
should not be whether the law is a good
law or not, but it is his duty .to execute it
as he ilnds it. When one enforces this
law because it is the law, the same cry is
heard about 'blue' laws' and 'dead laws.'
Those in having the ! law vio
lated set up' the specious ple^a that it v in
terferes/with personal liberty. "It 'is rib
iriore aii interference with personal liberty
than any law that restricts the acts of
men in accordance with the rules of civ
ilized society. If one wPuld like to- see
men whose" personal llberty : has been in
terfered-* wfth hfeiin'go to the State peni

' "liiberty Hq make laws does'not'glve li
cense to break laws \u25a0by any means. ; If
each:man were â¢ allo wed Uo say- what laws
are. good and. ;what; laws-. are:bad and; to
ignore the- laws he considers ibadTthere
would be no laws at all. .The.trust'mag
nate looks with abhorrence upon the pick
pocket who violates the ; larceny statute,
but thinks he has the right to break the
law against combinations and monopolies;
the burglar detests the lawbreaklng \u25a0of
the trusts,' but considers the lawragainst
housebreaking as an interference -with
his personal liberty ; the . boodler \ wants
the law enforced against the man: who
takes his property, but' looks- on. the
statute against bribery as an unwarrant
ed regulation of his. conduct; the.dram
shop-keeper calls loudly for the punish
ment of the man who robs his .cash
drawer, but deems' the statute requiring
his dramshop to close on Sunday as puri
tanical arid tyrannical." So it goes. Men
will observe the laws they like, but feel
they should be allowed to Ignore those
they do not like. The Individual | cannot
be permitted to judge for himself as to
the wisdom of laws, for that would put
it in the power of each person to nullify
the will of the riiajbrity. .
SWORN TO SUPPORT LAW. -
"Those .who oppose the enforcement of
any particular- law do not " usually come
out boldly against; the enforcement of
that law,' but they claim to find some
other law that, is not observed, and there
by attempt -to discredit the enforcement
of â¢ any law. From \u25a0 the lawbreakers'
standpoint no law could ever be :enforced r
and no criminal could ever be punished,
because all criminals cannot be punished.
"One of the iriipediments in the reign
of law is the idea some have that it
hurts a State to have . exposures. Such
would, be the logic.;of a woman who
wotlld 'rie.vej.have her .house swept lest
some one ' might -think It needed it. No
State can be inlured/by the enforcement
of the law. It;-is more honorable, to .cor

The Incomparable White Steam Gar
THE CAR FOR SERVICE
NOW on exhibition AT THE WHITE GARAGE, 1878 MARKET STREET
''.^- -THis car has a wide; comfortable side door. The. wheel base is 114 inches, and it'has an entirely, new.
'burner constructed so as to eliminate the necessity for side flues, :together/witli other changes tending to r in-"
creased efficiency and r convenience of operation. The rear of the body is so shaped as to deflect dust- Under
the rear seat is a storage compartment of ample proportions.' JJHHb
The base of the burner is without perforations, and, the only air which is admitted is "that which* ls mixed
\u25a0< with the gasoline vapor entering throughthe induction tube. The fire is thus absolutely protected, and it is
practically impossible for it to be blown out, regardless of the velocity or direction of the wind. The, products
of combustion -pass upward between -the. coils .-and instead of issuing. through side flues, as in former models,
pass^downward through an annular flue which surrounds/the generator. By the time the gases have traveled
to the bottom of this flue they have given up practically all of their heat, and because of the liberal dimensions
\u25a0; of the down f'flue they are widely diffused and are dissipated in the open air without their escape being in any
way noticeable. This new arrangement also preVents any radiating heat being noticeable by the passengers in*

HUSBAND DURING A STRUGGLE.
Manuel Veneelau
Is Shot in His
Home.
WOMAN SAYS IT
WAS ACCIDENTAL
Tells Police Suicide
$ Was Her One
Motive.
OAKLAND, Sept. IS.â Enraged by Jeal
â¢usy over her husband's attentions to
other women. Mrs. Bessie Veneelau, 29
years old, a bride of three months, fatal
ly shot her husband, Manuel F. Vence
lau. a Southern Pacific Company em
ploye, at 1 o'clock this afternoon at their
residence, 755 Jefferson street.
In a desperate struggle between the
couple the pistol was discharged, a heavy
bullet entering the husband's abdomen,
tearing the vitals and inflicting a mortal
wound. The shooting was the culmina
tion of quarreling that had gone on some
time. It followed upon a meeting yester
day afternoon at the Southern Pacific
â¢station. Seventh street and Broadway,
where Mrs. Veneelau saw her husband
and his half-brother. Manuel Pereira,
talking with a woman. \
When the young wife urged her spouse j
to speak to her he paid no attention, but j
turned his back upon his helpmeet. She I
returned home In anger. The trouble was i
renewed to-day, Veneelau declaring he !
intended to go to Yreka with Pereira. The
wife upbraided him for his conduct yes
terday. In the midst of the quarrel she
rushed to a bureau drawer in the bed
room, got the pistol and the struggle be
gan. At the Receiving Hospital, where
the wounded man was taken, be declared
to Captain of Police Petersen that his
wife had deliberately tried to shoot him
first in the head, but that he grabbed the
weapon and that she then shot him in
the stomach.
SAYS IT WAS ACCIDENTAL.
To the police after she was arrested
l the young woman insisted that the shoot
ing was accidental. She asserted that she
got the pistol Intending to kill herself,
and that it was discharged while her
husband was trying to get it away from
her. ' â¢ "-.-\u25a0;
The couple were alone In the house.
Beys on the street heard the shot, and a
minute or two afterward Mrs. Veneelau,
carrying her husband, went next door to
Mrs. D. Moran's residence, -753 Jefferson
tt! eei, crying she had shot him, but had
not meant to do it. The police were called
and arrived to find the wounded man
back In the house, prostrate on a lounge,
where his wife was administering stimu
lants and trying to bathe the ugly bullet
1 wound.
Dr. O. D. Hamlln examined the Injury,
at the Receiving Hospital, where Venee
lau was taken, and after the police con
sented removed " the -wounded""" man to
Providence Hospital for an operation. The
fatal nature of the wound was quickly
disclosed.
Hysterical and in a state of collapse,
Mrs. Veneelau was sent to the City Pris
on, where for several hours she was,un
der the care of a physician before she be
came composed enough to talk about the
shooting.
The tragic event uncovered a bit of ro
mance in the lives of the man and woman
\vho were involved to-day. When she waÂ»
14 years old the wife of Veneelau wedded
James Moore, a shoemaker. Early in
their married life he became an Invalid.
For years Mrs. Moore cared for her bus
band and worked hard to support the fam-
Vly. Two of the three children died, and
k. last November the husband passed away.
The young widow, with her boy, Lee, 8
years old, continued the struggle.
The Moores had lived for several years
at 619 Fifth street, not far from Venee
lau, who became acquainted with them
and took a warm interest in the family.
Through his efforts Moore was given
membership in a Portuguese insurance or
ganization. At his death $1400 came to
the wife. It was no surprise to their
friends when the announcement of the
marriage, en June 21, was made. De
spite the discrepancy In years, Veneelau
being 51 years old. tall, swarthy and of
Portuguese birth, the woman said she
had a great affection for him because of
his Kindness during her years of strug
gling.
trouble: soox begixs.
The couple went to housekeeping at the
trim cottage where the shooting oc
curred. But there was domestic un
pleasantness. That $1400 Insurance money
was one cause of disturbance, according
to the wife. And she had heard much
rumor of her husband's predilections for
womenklnd- In fact he had been the
hero of several adventures which had
Involved him In some notoriety. These
stories more or less burdened the wife's
mind. They rushed upon her yesterday
when she met her husband with a strange
woman at the station, his headquarters.
Her demands to know' who was the
woman, the refusal to tell, the repetition
of the demand and. the husband's re
fusal to-<say. followed by threats of a
I fuit for divorce on both sides, then the
1 decision of Veneelau to leave, < all con
tributed to the final act. The husband
was packing a basket with
clothing when the quarrel reached the
pistol stage. "
Lee. the boy, was at the Grove street
school at the time, but he had been at
home for luncheon, and he , said \ his
mother and himself ate together, his
stepfather being In the basement. The
boy told the police his mother and Venee
lau had quarreled yesterday over a
woman.
COMPLAIXS OF ABUSES.
According to Rosie MacArada, a laun
dry Sirl, Mrs. Veneelau had complained
that ehe had been 111 treated by her bus
band ever since their marriage.
Mrs. Vencelau's statement to the po
lice follows:
"I had known my husband several
years before I married aim.. He had
been very kind . to me and had be
friended me in many ways. Through
him my first husband was Insured for
$1400 in a Portuguese society, the U. P.
E- C. After we were married Veneelau
thought it was my duty to pay half
of the expenses of our new home, and
that I should let him have half of the
insurance money. . I did not agree to that
because I wanted to save the money to
educate my son. My refusal caused feel
ing.
"I had heard women stories about my
husband, but I had not paid very much
attention to them. Yesterday I met
my husband and his half brother from
Yreka at the Seventh-street station. My
husband was talking to a woman, and
he turned his back on me, I did' not
to create a scene, so went home/
"When the trouble began to-day he
said be was going to Yreka, and I
wanted to go with him, but' he said he
could not afford to pay two fares and I
ehould have to stay home. There were
taore words and I went to the drawer and

got the .'pistol, : intending to kill myself.
But the weapon was discharged while
my husbands was trying to get It away
from j me. After be was shot I carried
him next door and then took .him .back
to the house." S
In brief Vencelau's statement â¢ was: '
"My wife shot me because she was
jealous and did not want me to go to
Yreka, thinking I was going with an
other woman. She .put the revolver at
my ear - and I grabbed the handle and
then I was shot.** .
Deputy District Attorney Everett
Brown and Captain of Detectives Peter
sen remained with Veneelau to take an
ante-mortem statement, after his re
moval to Providence Hospital. Veneelau
was for thirty years in the Southern Pa
cific Company's employ as a porter and
messenger. He was In charge of the
stations at Seventh street and Broadway,
and at First street and. Broadway. His
dark bearded face was a familiar one
to the regular travelers on the local
line. He was married by the Rev. George
W. White of Central Methodist Church
In San Francisco.
George T. Larrabee, who has been Mrs.
Vencelau's landlord, took charge of her
eon pending the arrival of her. sister,
Mrs. Mary Matthews of 36 Shipley street,
San Francisco.
â¢Larrabee, who resides at the southwest
corner of Jefferson and Fifth streets, de
clared Mrs. Veneelau had been a hard
working woman for years and had borne
nobly a heavy burden of care.
'Miss C. E. Coughlin, who resides at the
Grove-street school, was at the Venee
lau residence shortly before the shoot-
Ing. She said there was no sign of
trouble then. .
The woman with whom Veneelau talked
on Sunday afternoon, when Mrs. Veneelau
saw them, was Miss Annie Miller of Hay
wards, an acquaintance of both men, ac
cording to Pereira.
Veneelau to-night made an ante-mortem
statement, in which he accused his wife
of Intentionally shooting â¢ him. After he
physicians told him that he could not
live he made a will, leaving allof his es
tate to sisters In the Azores, and cutting
his wife out of any . share In his estate,
which, it is estimated. Is valued at $10,000
or more. '

ABERDEEN, S. D... Sept. 18.âRaln
in-the-Face, one of the leading chiefs
In the Custer massacre, and who is said
personally to have killed General Cus
ter, died at the Standing Rock Reser
vation, South Dakota, on. September 12.
He was 62 years old.
, Chief Rain-in-thÂ«-Face was a sub-chief
of the Uncapapa Sioux. His, chief claim
to a place in history rests on the savage
revenge which he is said to have taken
for his treatment by Captain Thomas
Custer, a brother of General Custer. Cap
tain Custer, it Is said, on one occasion
threw Raln-in-the'-Face out of Fort Abra
ham Lincoln, and the : Indian vowed he
would pay back the Insult with interest.
About a year later, at the battle of the
Little Big Horn; commonly known as the
Custer "massacre," Rain-in-the-Face had
the opportunity for which he had been
waiting, and after killing the captain he
Is said to have taken the heart from the
body and eaten: It.: Since the conclusion
of the war Rain-in-the-Face has lived on
the Upper Cheyenne Agency.
One of the attractions on the Midway
Plaisance at the Chicago world's fair
was Sitting Bull's log cabin, taken to the
fair, from the Mandan reservation. With
the : cabin were exhibited . a number of
other relics of frontier wars, and Chief
Raln-In-the-face and ,a . - score of his
braves gave occasional . ghost dances
within the concession. â¢â¢.\u25a0
Some time after. the arrival of Raln-ln
the Face at the fair grounds, % thÂ©man- :
agers of the concession "engaged ' a ; new
attraction in the person of;' Curley,; the
Pawnee scout who was with General
Custer's command* and was the only sur
vivor of the battle, of -the; Little- Big
Horn. Curley, It ; is , said, escaped the
fate of \u25a0 his comrades, white and : red, by
disguising himself with a Sioux blanket
and head-dress j picked \u25a0up on -, t he : battle
field. He - and \u25a0 Raln-in-the-Face were
mortal enemies, ; and during the fight
Curley; had attempted to reach- the chief
to engage him , in , hand-to-hand -combat.'
When the Pawnee" arrived ;at ? Chicago,
he was met at ? the I railroad 'i station -; by
the Mandan v concessionaires, \u25a0* who"* were
accompanied by .Colonel : Cody ; and' a
party of his .plainsmen from ; the "^ Wild
West show." 1 who '! had * known the scout
on the f rontler." ' iCurley Â« was ; escorted >to
the Sitting Bull cabin on the Plaisance.
As soon as the j Pawnee : and his ; old
time foe "came face â¢ to \u25a0 face,- the ; hatred
that - had . slumbered ;| for ,'more -- than ? a
score of years blazed : forth anew."Rain
in-the-Face gave *. the .? Sioux warwhoop/
and, I' drawing ', his knife," : rushed : , toward
Curley. The latter, i shrilling the war cry
of the ; Pawnees, : likewise 1 drew ; a ' knife,

BASIN MAY
BE GOULD'S
TERMINAL
Plan Being Considered to
Allow Western Pacific to
Share Santa Fe Property
on This Side of the Bay
GOULD AND RIPLEY
COxVFER OX MATTER
If the Deal Is Carried Out
New Overland Road Will
Have Equal Facilities
With the Harriman Lines
George Gould, head of the Western Pa
'dnc Company, and President Ripky of
the Santa Fe Company may " soon enter
Into an agreement by which the two rail
road corporations are to share Chin*
Basin as a Joint terminal point on this
tide cf Â£aa Francisco Bay. It has been
known for some time that the Western
Pacific Company was meeting many ob
etacles in trying to get a terminal In San
li rancisco, and it has been openly charged
â¢ ." iat ;Â« PreÂ£idâ¬nl Harriman of the Southern
Paciflc Company and John D. Rockefeller
were endeavoring in every possible way
to block the plans of the Gould road It
t^ctme Jtnown yesterday, however, that
Gould and Ripley have lately had several
conferences in the East regarding the
China Basin and reports reaching here
are to the effect that the proposition to
rr.ake the Santa Fe property a Joint ter
minal for the two roads Is meeting with
the favor of the Santa Fe officials.
The filling In of China Basin and the
construction of docks and switching fa
cilities has cost the Santa Fe Company
many millions of dollars. Altogether the
company owns thirty-five acres of land
commonly designated as the China Basin
The property has a valuable water front
age, along which the company has built
1255 feet of seawall that will afford it
excellent facilities for transferring freight
from ships to cars. In fact, it is admitted
that the bay frontage at this point Is far
more advantageous than the frontage ac
quired in many years by the Southern
Pacific Company. Behind the seawall is a
planked surface seventy-five feet In depth
and west of this is the ground which the
Santa Fe Company proposes to use as a
freight yard.
WILL DIVIDE SITE.
The proposition now being considered
by Gould and Ripley Is to divide this
epace. The Western Pacific will take the
southern half of the property and connect
it with its rails on the Oakland side of
the bay by building around the bay shore.
Although the officials of the Santa Fe
Company in this city are unwilling to
discuss the matter, tney admitted yes
terday that a part of the China Basin
may be ultimately used as a terminal for
the new Gould line. Back of the basin is
property ample in etze to meet any of
the requirements of the Western Pacific,
and It is reported that a large portion of
this has already been bonded by the
agents of Gould.
Within the past few days the officials of
the Western Pacific Company have made
several Inspections of China Basin and
the adjacent property with a view, it it>
eaid. of securing an estimate of- the j
amount of work that Is necessary to place i
It In condition for the use of the new I
road. Surveyors of the Gould line have
also been busy mapping out a route
around the bay from f|e Oakland side.
The result of the conference between
the Goulds and President Ripley will
mean much to the Western Pacific, whclh.
It is generally admitted, is seriously up
against it on the question of freight tre
rninal facilities on this side of San Fran
cisco Bay.
BASEST O.VL.Y SOLUTIOX.
Seemingly the China Basin Is the only
solution of the predicament confronting
the Gould line and apparently. Judging
from the reports received here yesterday,
the difficulties in the way of the Goulds
getting a foothold in San Francisco may

BROKERS WANT
TAX REDUCED
Proposed Decrease of Eeal
Estate..- Hen's Licenses to
Be Looked Into by Board
SUIT TO BE DISMISSED
No More Land to Be Bought
for St. Mary's 'Square at
Least for Present Time
The Board of Supervisors yester
day passed to print an ordinance im
posing a license tax of $25 a quarter
on real estate agents and house brok
ers when their commissions or fees ex
ceed $10,000 per quarter, and $10 if the
income is less. The old ordinance fixed
the maximum license at $100 and the
minimum at $5 and the San Francisco
Real Estate Board filed a petition that
the license be lowered, as it. was too
high compared with those in similar
pursuits. Tax Collector Scott recom
mended the reduction, believing that
It will result in increased revenue as
co-called "curb-stone" real estate brok
ers will be subjected to tax under the
ordinance.
At Brandenstein's request the ordi
nance was referred again to the License
Committee for further Inquiry, as he
did not think that valid reasons had
been advanced for making such a big
reduction in the license.
The Finance Committee directed
a dismissal of the proceedings in the
suit ag-ainst Victor Albauze to condemn
a jot of land forming part of the pro
posed St. Mary's square. The commit
tee stated that there is no intention of
acquiring any more land for the square
at the present time.
The following matters were disposed
-of: ''-~J~.w \u25a0 i"H7--:&

latter into San Francisco on reasonable

know that the State will have to give

and LiOan Association, emerged this even
ing from "a severe ordeal when Grove L..
Johnson announced in the Emmons case
that he had finished with the cross-exam
ination of Grange, but would reserve "the
privilege to recall him. Johnson sought
to place Grange In the light of an accom
plice in promoting the plan to bribe, the
four accused Senators, Bunkers," Emmons,
Wright and French. He ' objected to
Grange's testimony on [ this score," and a
long argument ensued between Johnson
and District Attorney Seymour with ref
erence to actual and feigned accomplices.
The weight of the law was shown to ; be
in favor of Grange appearing merely, as a
feigned accomplice in an effort to catch
offenders, and Judge Hart ruled that. his
testimony was admissible. . , \u25a0

General Charles ?A." ;â¢ Woodruff spoke
on "Some -Military; Lessons : of â¢ the "War
inthe Orient,"' and among other things
said:- - : Vr : : ' ,\u25a0\u25a0
When the United States Is at . peace she Is
constantly i preparing for more peace, â¢ Ignoring
every iesson learned . by 'bltterJ experience, and
when war comes she pays the extra price with
blood v and gold. When s Japan . was at . peace
she was ;â¢ preparing for war, â¢ and when It ; came
eveo'thing was ' organized - and ready on : land
and sea;- she - had agents -' all \u25a0 through '.Korea
and Manchuria; she knew the topography, the
temper, of the 'people and .just what - supplies
and transportation ; existed .there. -.. Her maga
zines of . food, arms. \u25a0 ammunition and hospital
supplies; > clothing; ; etc;^ were ; prepared. ; . Her
battleships and â¢ transports \u25a0 were *in â¢ condition
and her docks, shipyards,'? mines, lighters, etc.,
were ready.' .'Each man's position waa assigned
and there was no political . pull to change; it-
All felt that ' the â¢ field.; not Tokio, .would be
the. place where promotion and, honors would'
be \u25a0 gathered. : , \u25a0 " : ;- \u25a0 \
\ Mind ; you, ' these ' were soldiers, \u25a0no civilians
in uniform, officered by experienced soldiers,
disciplined; supplied with everything â¢ an : army
needs, and. their movements had not been ad
vertised â the rifles | of the skirmish ( line gave
the enemy the first* information of their where
abouts.* \u25a0â¢'\u0084: It was superb. It w,as war as sol
diers wage it. - unhampered by politics oppress.
The Japanese : originated but little; they adopt
fed and applied* the best military ideas of the
whole world." . â¢ . . . .;
.: General â¢ Nogi,' who conducted the operations
around Port ' Arthur, commanded a brigade that
participated in the successful \u25a0 assaults on that
place ttn years before.. â¢:â¢ Japan didn't keep on
raising new ' regiments,' officered \u25a0â¢ by . inexperi
enced men; : she promptly, replaced every man
who was killed or invalided home by a drilled
recruit ; from her reserves : and .promoted men
who had won | their . advancement on the field
of battle rather than tha fields of politics. This
doubled the value, of her battalions.- â¢'"â¢
Japan's \u25a0 sanitary care of her soldiers' was
most creditable. Part of this was due to her
thorough - preparation ; for the ' Intelligent care
of her; sick and wounded. . .-
WHAT THE WAR SHOWED.
The war showed very conclusively that the
best fleets cannot take a, well-fortified harbor;
therefore San Francisco is safe from a sea
attack;- proved ahat well-defended,' permanent
fortifications can ; only be reduced by. regular
siege operations, and that semi-permanent and
temporary ones can be carried by determined
assaults. ;<Jr*^SSSeÂ«S ![^BSSÂ£fÂ¥^S*Â»Â»;
â¢The great military lesson of the war, the
all-embracing one and the one which explains
all organization, discipline, strategy, rapidity
of | movement, constant victories, good health,
comparative comfort and final success of Ja
pan Is simply this : Japan . prepared for and
conducted the war on a strictly. common-sense,
scientific, ' business basis. The existence of
the nation was at stake and - neither political
nor social nor corporate ' Influence was per
mitted to dictate appointments,* select camp
grounds or interfere : with the military or
naval commanders, who were selected for their
provtn fitness, proven on battlefield and shot
swept decks.
And I wUh our mighty press, -sinking for the
moment selfishness and. partisan bias and rais
ing â¢to the sublimest* heights of patriotism,
would in no uncertain terms say to Presidents,
Congresses and the > American people:
' "Go thou and, do likewise." \u25a0 v ..;';\u25a0
COXCESSIOXS 'TO . CHl>A.tx i i
Professor \u25a0"-." Bernard ildses, Ph.f'D.,
L.L.D., in;- cart said: :
\u25a0-The revival oÂ£, China under the" leadership of
Japan is likely .to interest particularly the
peopleof the United States.' 'It is possible to
see that the aay is not far distant when China
will ask to be placed In". the. list of the most
favored : nations; - and when the request ;is
made it will be sranted.
'This ".will make it embarrassing, for the
United States to attempt â¢to erect or maintain
a \u25a0' barrier, of exclusion- In opposition to the
wishes of the Chinese Government.
\u0084 . Then in order jto preserve friendly relations
with the far Eastern nations It -will be neces
sary to extend to them the same, privileges and
courtesies that we extend to the European na
tions;, and under : this . condition the mainten
ance in the United States of the present scale
of Incomes and expenditures for the great mass
of. the people will be difficult, if not Impossible.
Dr. David Starr Jordan --' gave an ex
haustive paper in which he said:
We heard much not long* ago of the yellow
peril/- of the 400.000,000 Chinamen who. under
the- lead -of -40,000,000 Japanese, would trample
down and devour our Western civilization. i
This talk of yellow peril is crude nonsense.,
:\u25a0\u25a0- Unless we of 'the West lend Asia.' the money,-
Bhe will never eend an â¢ army . against Europe.
Asia Is poor, ' Europe ' is rich and war burns out
wealth as U burns out vitality.. \u25a0\u0084-.\u25a0- â¢

sey ; would ever enter the building again
after: ha appealed to the stockholders for
their "proxies to dispute ;control of the
road with George J. Gould at the annual
meeting in Toledo on ..October 10. While
several minor ofHcera: greeted . Mr. Ram
sey on his : entrance,' his was
chilly. His presence .was ignored by Ed
gar r.T., Welles, the vice-president, whose
desk 'nearly adjoins that of Mr. Ramsey,
and by other, chief pfficers.\;
George J. Gould . returned to-day from
his â¢ summer home in . the Catskills. His
office on the fifth floor communicates with
.that of Mr." Ramsey, but when' he was In
formed of the. latter's, reappearance his
quarters were locked and he hastily in
stalled himself on the -floor below, with
his secretary, stenographers and clerks.
Asked regarding. Mr. Ramsey's statement,
Mr. v Gould said: .< :.
'â¢"It is not. worthy of notice. The kind
est . thing I can do . is to make no com
ment." \u25a0 \u25a0 . :' ; . '.-
: Mr.. Gould .and, his " admirers, among
whom, is Edward T. Jeffreys, 'president of
the Rio Grande and Western Pacific, held
a conference in the board . room on the
fourth floor to consider the situation, but
no official statement was issued by them.
Mr. Ramsey, when told of . Gould's re
mark,, retorted: ':\u25a0
"You can say; to ; Gould for ; me that he
need be under no obligation to be con
siderate of ray], feelings. "I will absolve
him. from any such. ; obligation."
Regarding his, plans. for obtaining con
trol of the -Wabash Railroad, Mr. Ram
sey said: '~.- : ~. ;\u25a0 ... .
"I- would not have gone Into -this thing
unless I had , hopes of ' obtaining a ma
jority of the proxies. lam not the' sort of
person who -would- '.willingly go into a
losing fighL There are no great railroad
or financial interests whatever behind me.
As a" matter;. of fact, control of the de
benture bonds and stock of the Wabash
13 i held in independent hands."
Mr. Ramsey said he could "\u25a0 make no
estimate of the Gould or Rockefeller hold
ings in Wabash securities.
"I "will be "only too glad, however," he
said/ "to obtain the support of debenture
holders. They have an ' equal control of
the Wabash with the stockholders. Each
class of security holders elects six direct
ors to the Wabash board, the twelve men
thus elected choosing the thirteenth mem
ber of the board." â¢ '
' As" regards the legal; status \ot> his posi
tion as president. Mr.' Ramsey said It was
perfectly clear. i .
/'This is my.. ; office N until October .10."
he observed, "and may be longer/ I asked
the directors* for a vacation -of several
months from .the end of June until Octo
ber I. 1 -'I:. was, not offered : a. leave of . ab
sence and I . reserved . the right to return
afany time to resume my .duties." â¢
Asked whether he considered his powers
as president had been usurped," Mr. Ram
sey replied: "
' "It is true I" have been denied permis
sion to inspect the transfer books, but I
would not precipitate" a' quarrel â¢with the
employes In 'the secretary's office, over
the question of the" closed safe in which
the books are held. The details of the
operation of the road are not being sub
mitted to me, but I am familiar in a gen

This Is a good picture or another oM Cali-
fornia pioneer of Bakersfleld. CaL, Mr. Ben-
jamin H. Carter. Mr. Carter suffered for year*
with rheumatism. He dosed and dosed ana
dosed with medicines, but. as la moot easee.
medicines did him no good. He went to dif-
ferent springs and spent lots of money at ho-
tels and boarding-houses. .
The springs would help htm for a little
while, hut soon as he got back home the rheu-
matism would gradually return.
A few years ago the rheumatism *Â»egan to
be complicated with bladder lrritati<m and en-
larged prostate. The sufferer would nave to
get up many times during the night, whlcfi,
of course, spoiled his rest and finally began to
affect the nervous system and his general
health began to fall. Occasionally the â¢" txrin*
had to be drawn and this caused great suf-
fering, owing to the Irritated condition of thÂ»
bladder.
" It Just took thre* months for Electro-Caeuilo
home treatment to cure this bad case. "After
having suffered for years, and after havtnff
spent hundreds and hundre<la of dollars with-
out relief, to think that In three months' time,
at a trifling expense, ha was cured at his horn*
by Electro-Chemistry seems truly wonderful.
Patients living at a distance are loaned a.
ccmplete Electro- Chemic apparatus for the ap-
plication of â¢ Electro-Cnemiatry- They use It
until cured, then return it. They don't hay*
to buy it.
It Is always best for outside patients to com*
to the Institute once for a personal examina-
tion, so there can be no possibility of a mis-
take in diagnosis.
The proper treatment can be prepared. thÂ»
vse of the apparatus explained and the patient
can return to his or her home the same day.

Corporal Junes Tanner, the recently
chosen commander In chief of the Grand I
Army of the Republic, was tendered a !
banquet by the Union Leagrue Club last |
night. The dining hall was filled
vitii admirers of the new . commuidtr.
Following a splendid repast spe^ch
maklns w ** the feature of the evening.
In the assemblage were the representa- j
tlve raea of the city. The long tables |
were decked with American . Beauty .
roses, and - behind the seat occupied by j
the guest of the evening was a large pic- |
ture of President Roosevelt, \u25a0 about which .
was draped the United States flag of the
club. ' ' .
Colonel George H. Plppy was toast
rcaster. He flrst introduced Colonel E. B.
Hay of Washington, D. C, who said In |
part: j
When 1 came to this coast I had no idea i
ti at 1 was to b* present before this autrust |
a; semblase of mcii who have come to pay ;
tribute to one of the leading American citizens. ;
A? 1 follow the flag, so I also follow the dis
tirs-uished guest of to-niaht.
We are American citizens, and that means
a srÂ»at deal. We arc all bound together hi
or.c sentiment, and that sentiment Is the flag
that bears vis on to Justice and on to honor.
No greater champion of that flag: lives on
this earth than Corporal Tanner. ICo one has
sacrificed more than he and he did 'all this

Ex-Chap!ain Chief . Bradford of the
Grand Army followed with a short
speech.
PARTRIDGE SPEAKS.
The next shaker" was John S. Par
tridge. In Introducing the Republican
candidate for Mayor, Colonel Pippy com
mented: "California has commenced to
recognize the young man in politics."
Mr- Partridge said in part:
Honor to you. Corporal Tanner, and honor
to the Grand Army of the Republic The
Grand Army remains the exemplar of all that
was good in American patriotism In the trying
dayÂ» of the war. No tectionalism now exists.
There is no North, no East, no South, no
West. The ration Is now united into one
grand harmonious whole. The god of battles
tried our manhood and Corporal Tanner rep
resents the Ideal of this manhood.
Lead us up to the ideals of Tanner, fot
those are the ideals of true American man.
hood.
Colonel Pippy next introduced Corporal
Tanner. The' commander was received
â¢with tremendous cheering and all arose
to their feet and joined in singing "Amer
ica," More cheering followed. Corporal
Tanner was visibly affected by the
warmth of the reception. He said in part:
It Is with treat pleasure and with great
pride that I wear this badge upon ray breast
I consider it one of the greatest honors In
the Jand to be made chief of the Grand Army
*>f the Republic. What flag is grander : or
greater than ours? Wherever floats the Stars
and Stripes there liberty and freedom reign.
We must have pure government to uphold
the glory of the flag.
I was here among you two years ago. Lit
tle did 1 think at that time that on my next
visit to the coast I should be placed In this
high position. This honor that has come to
me is one that any man in the world would
t*Â» proud of. The boys saw fit to place this
fccnor on me.
At the recent convention held in Denver
250.000 members of the Grand Army of the
Republic met in annual conclave. It seemed
to me like a convocation of the past. Their
achievements had been left behind them.
Soon after I arrived here David Starr Jordan
asked nif to speak to the students at Stanford
University. I talked with them. Those boys
there are goinir to be in the future men of
this country. When the country wants them
titey will all be ready to answer to the call.
I am one of the remnants of the Grand
Army cf the Republic. t We are pasein? away
fast, but we have all stood for the honor and
glory of the country. The noblest men in
the country fought against one another daring
the war. but now no men are closer than
those who fought face to face at Appomattox.
We loved the South as Americans, but we
had to spank them. These people, now united
walk through the highest ideals of the nations
if the earth.
-THE noYS" PASSIXG AWAY.
How the boys are passing away l . The vet
erans are dropping off by thousands. We
Fhall not be with you long. We expect \u25a0In
ISI2 we will have the Grand Army of the
Republic meet in this city. We first came
Vr e in 1656. The- great American star has
aioved beyond the western coast. Here in
this city through the Golden Gate is the way
the boy* so- out. - They are the sons of men
of the Grand Army of the Republic and they
are the boys who hold the flag Just as steadily
as their fathers did.
Where we have planted our flag we will

Youtli Who Was Head of

CONSIDERATION SHOWN
Because of Confession and
Aid to Sheriff Judge Makes
His ' Punishment Light
OAKLAND, Sept. 18. â James Crow
hurst, youthful criminal, leader of the
"Jim Crow" gang that murdered
Thomas W. Cook." and. by his own con
fession guilty of highway robbery, was
sentenced to seven years at Folsom by
Judge Melvin this morning. He pleaded
guilty to having held up. in company
\u25a0with Percy Pembroke, another member
of his srtins, one Ed Stanley, a barber,
and robbed him of $28.
A plea of mercy was made for Crow
hurst by Attorney G. W. Langan, who
pointed out to the court the age of the
defendant and the/f act of his having
saved the county the expense of a trial.
In. passing sentence Judge Melvin said:
You are charged with robbery, which is
the moet cowardly of all offenses, for you
uere armed and your victim Â»m not. There
lb ; nothins heroic about it. You held up a
peaceable citizen and had he resisted you
would have killed him. Though you are young
he wouid have been jus; as dead as thoujch
it had been done, by an older hand. Fortu-
Btt<?!y Alameda County has a ishtriH who be
lievee' that' toe has other duties to perform
than iservinK .civil process** aud you were
<iufi.kJy brousfct to the bar of justice.
by your plea, of puilty. however, you have
eaved . tbÂ£ ptate considerable .expense. and by
the information you have given the officers
you have aided the caute of justice and T will
give you a lighter sentence in consequence.
Crowhuret is the first to be sent to
prison of* the band of young toughs
who for several months terrorized the
Fruitvale district, the carnival of crime
ending with the murder of Thomas
Cook by Percy Pembroke, John Schnei
der and George Blaker, for which crime
they are now awaiting trial. Crow
hurst was not implicated in the murder,
but through different confessions made
be was implicated in the robbery of
Stanley and admitted his guilt.

WOLLE'S HOPES HIHG
Professpr^
1 1 ;^eM^ ,
BERKELEY, Sept: 18.â Dr. J. Fred
erick Wolle, the new professor of music
at the State University, arrived with
his wife and daughter at Berkeley this
afternoon. He was met by. Eugene R.
Hallett, private secretary, of .President
Wheeler. _ , ... .. - : ...
President and Mrs. .Wheeler have
planned a reception, on next ; Thursday
evening, at Hearst. Hall, at which Dr.
Wolle and his family will be greeted
by a number of prominent musical
people of San F.rancisco and. cities
around the bay. . , :; - -,-
Fatigued by his journey across' the
â¢continent from Bethlehem, Pa,, Pro
fessor Wolle was disinclined to discuss
i at length his plans for the new depart
ment of music at the university, saying:.
too, that he desired to become better
acquainted with university conditions
before outlining anything in the nature
of a formal course.
Dr. Wolle's home for many years
has been in the Moravian settlement at
Bethlehem, Pa., a community which or
ganized its first orchestra In r784, and
which, according to one critic, was told
in musical, experience before Boston
or New York had any musical experi
ence at all." Dr. Wolle explains that
the German love for music was mani
fest in the community at its inception
more than a ; century ago, when the
"stately German chorales, the music of
the German reformation, supplied the
tunes to which the Moravian folk sang
hymns." The organists In the Moravian
churches at Bethlehem were artisans,
usually, but they were thorough musi
cians, as were the greater part of the
community. - :
It was In this atmosphere that Dr.
Wolle developed the famous Bach festi
vals, giving: both himself and the com
munity added fame. The "Passion Ac
cording to St. . John," by Bach, was
given under Dr. Wolle's direction in
1899, and In 1900 the first Bach festival
was held, continuing for three days,
with two sessions daily, the B minor
mass being rendered then for the first ;
time in America. After that the festl- ;
val was made an annual event.
Dr. Wolle Is to begin hi* work in
the musical department of the univcr- ;
sity at once. The last Legislature ap
propriated money for the expenses of
the department.
Professor Wolle said:
I come to California because I expect to find
a larger fiald for the exercise of my activi
ties than I could find at home. I come here
hoping to find large musical resources and
therefore hope to achieve greater and better
results. I know little and care less about the
quality of the voices In California, but I care
a great deal about the way the voices shall be
used.. Though my Bach choir has been' said by
the metropolitan critics to be letter perfect, I
lay no stress on this. I enro not whether my
pupils sing the right notes or the wrong notes,
but I care very much whether . they sing , me
chanically or with understanding and spirit. X
bring greetings from the musicians of Penn
sylvania, who earnestly and " generously \u25a0 hope
that the results to â¢* obtained in the West will
eclipse their best endeavors in the East.

ALAMEDA TELLS
OAKLAND ABOUT
CLEANING UP
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE
OAKLAND, Sept. 18. â It was a pity that the
Women's Civic Improvement Club â¢ could net
boast a larger attendance at the annual meet-
Ing to-day, for the most practical Illustration
I of how to do things that this 'struggling asso
ciation has ever received was given this aft
ernoon by John H. Hartog of Alameda. Mr.
Hartog did not indulge in theory or oratorical
flights of fancy, but in the ; language of the
street, "he was there with the gooda."
He not only told how the Alameda Advance
ment Association, of which Mr. Hartog is man
| ager.' had cleaned miles of sidewalk, j removed
i hideous signs and whitewashed fences by the
block, but by means ,-â¢ of photographs, taken
"before' and after," gave indisputable evidence
of the splendid work that has been accom
plished in less, than a year. '
It has long been, the custom for our metro
politan neighbor across the bay to . sneer , at
sleepy Oakland, while Oakland In turn ' threw
recks at Alameda , that was not sleeping, but
dead. But now Alameda has suddenly ' re
vived and Is essaying to teach us the strenu
ous, life that, leads to the city beautiful.
. ThÂ« Advancement .Association has
gone ab^ut the resuscitation of our little subur
ban sister in a very business-like manner.
Headquarters were fitted up In , the . heart of
town, a gang of-, workmen employed and whÂ«n
Mr. Hartog was not personally directing his
men. he was 'trying : to make the - people " see
Alameda's needs and ' possibilities as he saw
them â and be has the true artistic Instinct.
Unique window cards were almost the first
means he took to attract public attention and
start. the wagging of the public's tongue. When
a lot or a sidewalk was to be cleaned the
owner** permission was first uoughtand lf'not
obtained, > his property \u25a0 was ; made i presentable
anyhow. In nearly, every case the : property
owner,, was so pJeased with the improvement
that a voluntary subscription would more than
pay for the cost of the work, for the majority
of people arc- really public-spirited in a neutral
sort of a way, but.lt takes a masterful mind
to penetrate the average crust of indifference.
. Oakland,'' of course, is. a much larger town
than Alameda and > the : task < which - the Civic
Club; has taken upon itself : Is .' a < herculean
one. truly, and heretofore it has wasted energy
in too diffused effort., Tree-planting, children'!
playgrounds and the garbage question have di
vided * attention with the all-important one of
clean " streets. â¢ \u25a0 Concentrated j effort I would soon
result- in. some one. thing being well done and
public interest once aroused, other â¢ Improve
ments would follow. . â¢- â¢
When Ex-Mayor Olney removed, -"willy
nllly,' all the obstructions along Broadway,
i there was a. general "kick" all down the line '.
: But who would put them back now?. ~ '"..'.;

CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS.
IN the investigation of the great insurance corporations in New
; York it is disclosed that they were contributors to the Republican
national campaign funds in 1896, 1900 and 1904. This is hardly
in the nature of news, since the treasuries of corporations have long
been the favorite resource of committees of both parties for funds
to pay the increasing cost of national campaigns.
As far away as the time of Dean Richmond, the J. P. Morgan of
his day in railways and finance in New York, the system was in
vogue, and he, though a Democrat, placed the money of his rail
read wherever it would do the most good in politics, though in na
tional matters he restricted this generosity with the funds of his
stockholders to his own party. It was as much improper- use of
trust funds as it is in the case of the insurance companies. . %
It is admitted that such contributors expect that their interests
will be served by these contributions. The candidacies of Mr.
Bryan were especially alarming to the insurance companies of the.
whole country, for he announced his discovery that they received
more money in premiums than they paid out in losses, and declared
his intention to destroy them. Just how a President- of the United
States proposed to destroy corporations that were not under Federal
jurisdiction was not stated. But the threat had a very alarming
effect, and the scare seems to have been very enduring. It is esti
mated by experienced men that of the money given to either party
in national campaigns, about one dollar is applied to campaign work
to ten dollars lost and absorbed on the way."
Outside of the permanent and skilled politicians who arc the
dispensers of such funds, there is an exaggerated idea of the effect
of money upon elections. In 1904, for example, President Roosevelt's
vote would have been as large as it was if not a dollar had been spent
except for postage stamps. Money did not figure at all in procuring
results. The same was true in 1900. In 1896 both parties had over-,
flowing treasuries. The company of silver millionaires that backed
Bryan put their money and enthusiasm into the campaign in equal
measure. To go farther back, in the campaign of 1 838 in this
State the Democratic committee was lush in assets. In that year
the railroad impartially contributed equal sums to. both State com
mittees, and the amount was not small. But the expenditure of the
Democratic campaign funds produced no results.
This exacting of campaign contributions is neither new nor
confined to one party. It has long been recognized by thoughtful
men in both as a growing evil, which such men would be glad to
limit or altogether suppress. This can be done either by the com
pulsion of law or public opinion, which can compel publicity in the
matter of campaign funds and their source. It is largely a species
of graft. , But as long as one party uses it the other feels compelled
to do the same. When Chairman Barnum of the Democratic Na
tional Committee in 1876 was calling by wire for "more mules," his
brother-in-error of the Republican committee got busy "frying the
fat" out of the manufacturers. When contributions are published
every week, by both committees, there will be a check upon the use
of trust funds, either of railroads or insurance. companies.
The current disclosures in New York are made the subject of
an interview by Judge Parker, the Democratic candidate : of last
year. He hastens to say that they prove his charges made daring
the campaign. This desire to prove himself to have been a sleuth
or a prophet rather overreaches the fact. His personal attack on the
President and Mr. Cortelyou was that the latter was put at the head
of the Department of Commerce in order that he might get knowl
edge of the misdeeds of corporations under his jurisdiction in order
to use that knowledge to blackmail them out of campaign funds.- \u0084,.'"
The law creating the Department of Commerce and Labor pro
vides. "Section 3. That it shall be the province and du}y of said
department to foster, promote and develop the foreign and domestic
commerce, the mining, manufacturing, snipping and fishery indus
tries, the labor interests and the transportation 'facilities of the
United States, and to this end it shall be vested with jurisdiction and
control." Judge Parker's allegation was that this' jurisdiction was
abused for blackmailing purposes, and not that corporations outside
of that jurisdiction were making campaign contributions. As Secre
tary of Commerce Mr. Cortelyou had no jurisdiction over the insur
ance companies of New York or of the country. As Chief Justice of
the Court of Appeals Judge Parker had the/ New York insurance
companies under his judicial jurisdiction. Did any of them give
money to Mr. Belmont for his campaign ? . ; \u25a0 -
No one is out justifying the contributions that are disclosed, and
only Judge Parker is in evidence madly signaling for attention to
his exceeding virtue as a politician and dead-shotness as a prophet.
If he desire to do some real reformatory work let him use his influ
ence as the leader of his party to get an agreement between both
committees about the collection and expenditure of campaign funds.
At present it is 'without regulation or legal responsibility. There is
no Washington Gladden in either party to refuse to- touch tainted
money, and neither committee keeps a sub-committee on smelling to
detect the origin and moral quality of the funds that reach the
treasury.
POLITICS IN THE UNIONS.
OXE of the unions affiliated with the Building Trades Council
officially repudiates Mr. P. H. McCarthy's indorsement of
Mayor Schmitz and Mr. Ruef. This is done by the painters,
who are well able, the3 r think, to do their own political color work
without calling in Mr. McCarthy to paint them his stripe. From
this copious and carefully worded statement, published in The Call,
it appears that they object to being bid off as a piece club, and with
out indorsing any party or candidate, they frankly declare their
opinion of Mr. McCarthy and his manipulation of the Trades Council
in politics. They refer to internal dissensions and to their perse
cution by McCarthy, because they "opposed the corruption and po
litical graft of the Building Trades Council," and declare that "an
intelligent union man is not going to allow any one, even if he is a
political labor boss, to insinuate that he will vote for any particular
candidate.''
This action is significant of the grdwing spirit of independence
in the unions. The attempt to chattelize them- in the interest of a
municipal administration that will "stand by" Mr. Ruef "through
all. seems destined to meet some stout resistance. Labor seems
to think that it has othe? things to do than electing Mayors to stand
by the singular and secretive statesman whose! business genius makes
him a stockholder in enterprises that-are under the jurisdiction of
boards appointed by the Mayor.
Mr. Ruef having taken, the public into his confidence, so far as
to confess that the Mayor stands 'by him "through all," should go
further in his Damon and Pythias disclosures, and tell the union
men whose votes he seeks just how many times the Mayor stood by\
him and in what matters; and why he needed such support: It may
be all right and nice and proper, and may make such an impression
upon the public fancy that by and'by there will be a group of; statr
vary representing the tall Mayor standing by the short lawyer, with
Maestretti and the convicted ballot-box â¢stuffers ' doing the cherub
business around the pedestal.
The independence: of the Painters' Union may well be expected
to set the fashion for others, who will act upon ; it,,even if they do not'
take the trouble that is necessarj-; in taking combined public action,

to me by a reader of this paper. .
. This subject has been discussed innu
merable times -by innumerable
and the, opinions : given are infinite in Va

question from -his own. particular view

personal experience, his direct observa

history. - ... ' : ' V/ - '
Experience provides only a. one-sided
standard of judgment, however, : for what
happens in our particular case may be no
criterion by which to measure other cases.
Observation -is | inadequate, too, | for. the
external view gives us little knowledge of
the inner experience ;in any; love : affair.
We . may . look 'I upon this or "that ; pair of
rapturous lovers ' or : we \u25a0 may. observe ] this
<jr that prosaic married ; couple and -pro
nounce our ' own "Judgments: '-; But .our : de
cision may be at fault," for we cannot see
the Inner workings 'of any. life. .
' We cannot guess how great us the pow
er one woman wields ;as compared jto j the
influence of :\u25a0 another. 'We /are employing
surface \u25a0vision : only -and we have notl the
keyto the true situation. *\u25a0\u25a0 - \u0084 ' -/'\ - : - -".-â¢â¢;
Fiction is but an attempt to picture: life

are word paintings " of | existence* and . we
may ' or' may- not "accept them .as true

S~\ H. the Devil sat in hades # in its

v/ While a host of "gents" and "la

There were several million mortals who
were gasping on the, floor.

Then the devil chuckled queerly in ex

As he said: "I love them dearly, as most
anyone must see:
That I love the whole collection; It .is
needless to suggest.
But I find on calm reflection that I love
them fritdthe best."
Then the Devil sat, as thinking, and he
chuckled not at all.
lAs he sat with eyes "unblinking where
the smoke wreaths, wove a pall.
I And he": said: "Upon reflection. I am
fond of them in roast.
And: they make a choice refection when
they're neatly served on toast;
But to love these little fellows in the
style. approved by Hoyle.
You should keep them till time mel
lows, and then try them done in
oil."
Then the Devil chortled queerly. and
his style seemed almost gay,
As he said. "I love' thtm dearly; yes. I
â¢ love them any way."

NATIONAL DECADENCE
AND WOMAN SUFFRAGE
To the Editor of The Call:
Dr. Edward A. Ross, of Lincoln. Neb.^
in his recent address at the Chicago Uni
versity mentions several reasons why he
believes that American standards of po
litical Integrity and civic" 1 " honesty are
lojver now than they were a half-century
a?o. Prominent among: these reasons are
the tremendous loss of life of. the bravest
and best men in the Civil War and the
filling a of these vacancies at the polls with
an Influx of foreigners. Dr. Ross claims
that saloon-keepers, pugilists and tho
municipal boss are the magnates of the
land, showing that the electorate has
been "debased by the too free admission
of political incapables." If this be true,
does not the extension of the elective
franchise. to the women citizens offer a
remedy that is at once simple, just and
logical? ,;. .
No wholesale extermination of American
women has taken place. Of the "new
comers" to this country, whom Dr. Ross
distrusts, three-fourths are men. In tha
United States are 14,000,000 women of vot
ing age. seven-eighths of them native
born. Many are graduates of our schools,
teachers of our children, members of our
churches.; readers of our newspapers; all
of them are sharers of the thoughts, prin
ciples and opinions of fathers, brothers,
husbands or sons. If American Ideals can
be re-established by restoring to the vot
ing constituency a greater ! preponderance
of citizens born and educated in this
country it can be accomplished, by'follow
ing the progressive example of Australa
sia ' and granting suffrage alike to men
and .women citizens. yfSSteS

Thia week they hayÂ« a chance at it on

Finall son in his arms at a small German
village, announcing himself aa - Bugen

Cut somehow you feel it Is all right,

hercic gentleman had a wife (now dead),

noble shoulders. Then the family, Just In

arrives to take away the Count's child
it is not Mr. Whittlesey's fault
that his role suggests the 'black
alpaca heroine here. And the villain
â¢till pursues him.
She is in love with the Count, and the
Count unfortunately has set his heroic
affections upon a young Englishwoman,
who hat come to Germany to study sing
ing. Ht says so himself. In the foyer' of

. He nobly plays his rival's composition
nobly. He nobly again remains silent
when the villainette â she reforms â
has him accused of the forgery.
In fact (between ourselves) you
get a little tired of his no
bilities, though not for worlds would I
say it out aloud. And nobly it all comes
right In the end.
Seriously, with all its naivete, "The
First Violin" is a romance with many
gay and clever touches of German life,
with a sweet and wholesome atmo
sphere, and is very effectively present
ed by the Alcazar company. White
Whittlesey has the Mansfield role of
Count Eugen and simply oozes ro
mance therein. As the fond papa he
is charming, and not in the least
bathetic, which the role gives dire op
portunities for. and as the lover he is
courtlier than ever. The atmosphere
of quixotism of the play suits Mr.
Whittlesey exactly. Miss Eugenic
Thais Lawton is the English girl, and
appropriately girlish and' sincere. Miss
Belgarde did the adventuress with
every evidence of enjoyment, which
was heartily shared by the audience.
Miss Nera Rosa and Miss Ruth Allen

"The White Tigress of Japan," an
episode of the Russian- Japanese war,, ls
one of the most exciting melodramas
that have ever been put upon the stage
at the Central. The play calls for a
wealth of scenery and costumes, and
gets them. Kimonos and electric foun
tains, jinrikishas. Japanese, Chinese,
Russians and Americans form the mot
ley units of a brilliant panorama of
grace and color. Especially pictur
esque is the setting of the first act, a
Japanese garden in the center of which
gayly colored paper lanterns and an
electric fountain are seen. As the cur
tain arose upon each of the four acts
there were cries of "banzai!" by the
Japanese in the gallery and band clap
pings by the rest of the house.' 'Twas
a flattering testimonial to the liberality
and enterprise of the management in
placing upon the stage a " melodrama

"Finally. 6 years ago, I began to use
Grape-Nuts food. I grew stronger in a

Barnoldo's dogs, cats and monkeys were
new at the Chutes yesterday and made
hits at both performances. Mr. and Mrs.
Gottlob proved pleasing in their rural
comedietta. "Government Bonds," and
Mignon Gilbert in her character sketch,
"The Female Drummed," received several
recalls. Frank Clayton, a black face mo
nologlst, and Foster and Henderson, col
ored entertainers, did some good singing
and dancing. The LaFayette T LaMont
troupe of comedy acrobats repeated their
success of last week, and the Animato
scope completed an excellent programme.
Zarrow. the sensational cyclist, created a
thrill with his startling exhibition of
'leaping the gap." The amateurs prom
ise a lot of surprises on Thursday -night,
and there will be a Cakewalk at the
Chutes on Saturday evening.

DR. GLADDEN SCORES /
FRENZIED FINANCIERS
Declares They Are Utterly
Destitute of Respect
for Law. .
PORTLAND, Sept. 18.â In concluding
a sermon on "Revivals," Dr. Washing
ton Gladden of Columbus, Ohio. â¢ last
night said:
. "There is need of a general awaken
ing of religious thoughts The intensity
of the strife for gain, which drives the
business world at a "constantly accele
rating pace- and puts Mammon on: a
throne far above - all other; kingdoms;
the rising tide of luxury and [display;
above all the astounding -..revelations
which have been made i within the last
year of conditions in the political 'and
financial realms, all indicate a moral
emergency In which some stronger in
tervention .is demanded than human
expediency can contrive. Any one .who
has read the recent magazine : articles
must feel that we are confronting a
grave crisis. Men whose operations
are therein described are not only ut
terly, destitute of respect for law; they
are doing all they - can to undermine
all'law andto destroy the very founda
tion of the civil , order. These men
either believe ,that thereis no God^or
that there is a weak: and foolish: God,
whom they can cajole by their .ostenta
tious gifts to colleges and charities.. ;
"If the hearts of. the â¢ Christian
ple were full of > the ] sense of I; God's
presence there would be an atmosphere
in which the -boodler t and .the, frenzied
financier could not breathe."

started for San Diego.',-: The' honors of

SCENE IS DRAMATIC.
The scene at the openingof. the trial

his vessel -and rescued." a drowning
sailor ; has been " one â¢of * the best-loved
men" in the ', navy, stood %to plead not
guilty to the first charges ) ever made
against him in court-martial, the eyes
of many of- the spectators, were damp

do ' all In his power to; make : him a world

ship timber In. his makeup, and if such is
tff3 case Delaney ' will surely, bring him :to
.the /front.* /, ' '"U ".';'\u25a0â¢\u25a0?'\u25a0 ~"\' " \u25a0'-\u25a0 '
. This , bit , of ne W8 \ will " come â¢as-. a : mam
moth surprise ;to , the members .of .the
sporting,' fraternity, .all of . v whom 'thought
Delaney has; quit the game forever. with
Jeffries. But '\u25a0\u25a0 the old' warhoree is never
content unless; he has a champion on his
hands . and '\u25a0 from now on he will use all
his efforts to make the Olympian the best
in the world. , . / ; .
._ Kaufmann * is Â» certainly - the ; best \u25a0 ama
teur heavyweight -- boxer - Calif orniav has
produced "in! years. .His. Vise In the ranks
was nothing > short * of-, phenomenal, - and
now; he stands at â¢ the head of - his class
without; 'aY single, /opponent J> in sight.
Every, one who knows .will admit that the
Olympian giant' can beat" half 'the pro
fessional heavyweights â¢ before I the public
to-day, and, with Delaney to teach him,
he Â« has i a royal chance to soon hold the
honors discarded by the king of them all,
Jim Jeffries. \ \u25a0'. : '". '',.;
1 Billy, Delaney made Jeffries as" well as
Jim ;Corbett. The fighters admit this.
He : has had . more success as a trainer
and manager ' of , great fighters than any
other . man who ever lived, and he : must
see ; at; bright future ' In store for Kauf
mann, else he n*ver would * have gone to
the trouble* of taking him under his wing.
. Delaney has | seen the young Olympian
perform in ! many amateur ; bouts, and the
style of the , latter struck him favorably.
He made, up his mind to take hold of : . the
youngster without further ceremony, and
after a deal'of persuasion the latter final
ly yielded to the veteran and cast his lot
with \ him. Delaney will set to work , at
onoe to arrange a | match- for Kauf raann,
and; the professional.debut T of the young
ster- promises to be the headline^ in the
world of; fisticuffs. ' ? ' : "'" '
When seen at his home In Oakland last
evening, Billy Delaney said:
".Yes, It is true that.l have decided to
take charge of Kaufmann, and I believe
that he * has ; the ability to make good In
the professional: ranks. I had fully, made
up my,: mind to retire from the handling
of, fighters, and had it not been .for the
fact .that f Charles Kaufmann, the ; father
of â¢ the ? young man, : Is one of my .best
friends, I would not have taken charge of
his affairs, .v . :
/'From .what I have seen of, Kaufmann's
work I am satisfied that, he will succeed.
He apparently has all the qualifications of
a successful heavyweightâ reach, ; height,
"cleverness, varid, -what * is' best- of all; a
punch in either, hand. ;;Of course, ; so .far
all i his . fights"; have been amateur \ con
tests "and he has always beaten his man
in ar ound, so: It remains to be seen-^ow
he will come out ; in a long, , hard fight.
Had , I , not . been . sure, . however, ;' that he
-would make good, I should not have
taken him up; ;~ >\u25a0 - \u25a0 - '"."'is':*:
"At ; presents I have no match in . sight
for. him,; but I shall do just as I did with
Corbett and : Jeffries, bring him to the
front: slowly and not make the mistake of
going after game that Is too bJg right at
the start.
.'-'I believe that I am safe In saying that
Kaufmann will some day be champion of
the world."- ./ -

NELSON BAILS
FAIR MAID OUT
Battling Dane Comes to the
\u25a0Rescue of Celia Fay, Who
IsAccused of-Dipping^Men
Battling: Nelson is a gallant young man
as well as a great fighter. No one around
the Hall of Justice will dispute this fact,
for , yesterday " afternoon the Dane
marched up to the bond and warrant
clerk's desk and produced 5250 so that
Celia Fay. an alleged dip and light-fin
gered lady might go free till her trial
is begun.. ... :
Celia Is an old friend of Bat's. In fact,
she :Is : the ' same young, woman who
caused; so much trouble -. between the
champion* and his former manager, : Te
ddy Murphy, after the Britt-Nelson fight
last.w inter. It was rumored around the
line 'at the time that . Bat fell a victim
to the charms of the woman, but soon
after he left town and everything seemed
forgotten.' : : .
But now.tho fair Celia looms up in the
limelight once again and, Bat shows he
is still as good a fellow, as of old by go-
Ing right to the bat and getting her out
of the ' City's free boarding; house by pro
ducing the coin he earned by the sweat
of ;his. fists. It, looks as though the old
affection is ripening again, for Bat would
hardly go the. whole route for nothing.
' Celia Is accused . of dipping along the
line. She was arrested on two charges
of petty larceny and. her. trial will come
iff within the next few days. Thanks to
the kindness of the Battling Dane. CelTa.
will have a chance >to flutter along the
line till the day of reckoning Is at hand.

before the ; Pacific '; Athletic Club of Loa

Manager". Harry Leap, who Is looking
after, the Interests of "Cute Eddie," will
to-day place $1000 in the hands of Harry
Corbett as a wager that Hanlon will beat
Herrera. As the Mexican has been anx
ious to bet on his ; chances It looks as
though he will cover the money. The,for
feits of both men will also be posted this

Hanlon has improved wonderfully In the
last few months. In his fight, with "Willie
Fitzgerald at Los Angeles a few weeks
ago he astounded the crowd with his clev
erness and hard hitting. : If he Is success

McLAUGHLDT TO SWAP
BLOWS WITH MTJEEAY
Hawthorne Club Arranges a
Likely Looking Card for "
Monthly Show.
The amateur card to be put on at
Woodward's Pavilion " next - Friday night
by." the > Hawthorne .' Club has an excep
tionally attractive look/ There are no
particular staraon the programme. . but
every.' boxer' billed" to appear Is able to
do the Queensberry stunt to the satisfac
tion of the ring-goers of this locality.
* The main event brings together Jack
McLaughlin. the champion middle-weight
of Great Britain, and George Murray, the
bruising Olympic Club pugilist. These two
worthies are expected : to put ' up a hair
raising argument that should terminate
ere the' gong announces* the end of the
scheduled four rounds. Murray has a stiff
punctr that usually brings home victory
whenever it lands on a vulnerable spot
on an opponent. The Englishman, how
ever,, is quite . shifty and has mastered
the hit-and-get-away game to perfection,
but an instant's carelessness or failure
to. have" the necessary guard up may en
able the i blond-headed youth from the
Post street clubhouse to sneak in his wal
lop ; and lower the foreigner's. colors.
Jack Rodney has been steadily climbing
to the " top . of the ' pugilistic I ladder, and
just when he thought he had an opportu
nity, to snatch the amateur lightweight
title from Bob Lundie, the Pacific Ath
letic Association steps in -and bars the
ex-Olyrap'ic Club boxer from further par
ticipation in amateur fights. Rodney, had
been promised a match ' with Lundie this
month as : a headliner , but ; the Interven
tion 0f ... the powers that be ; in amateur
sports made it impossible for the go to be
pulled off. . Frank Flores has been secured
to try to stop Rodney's victorious * ca
reer, "and the Olympic Club members
think that their boy can stow away the
Ocean View . crack before the bout has
gone tha limit.- V"
.The rest of the card Is made up as fol
lows: Bruno Casini vs. . Ed Johnson, 115

Special Dts3Â«tch to The CalL
SEATTLE. Sept IS.â ln order to put
an end to his loosing .streak. Mike Fisher
had to call Bill Thomas back to-day and
the result .shows he made no mistake
In judgment. Notwithstanding the fact
that Thomas was hit hard, he â¢ kept iSa
head. Skel Roach made a very poor
showinjr. though his record this season
has been a good one. To-day he walked
sir men. Just when he needed it his sup
port failed him. Seattle also lost every
close decision. .
Frary caught a beautiful game, pegr
glngr out five runners who $ried to steal.
and he would have had three more had
not Bennett and Lauterborn dropped per
fect , throws. TVlth two men out In the
fifth Inning. Roach walked three men In a
row and then Mike Lynch cut a hot on*
past Hall and the same was lost. The
locals made more errors than they made
all last week, and the whole bunch
showed the effect of the strain they hays
been under trying to crawl out of the
cellar. The Tacoma team played grand
ball behind Thomas and deserved to win.

MBRGURY
WORSE THAN THE DISEASE
'The effects of Mercury and Potash are
worse than the effects of Contagious
Blood Poison, for. which these minerals
are generally used. Thej\ cannot cure
the disease, and in addition set up a pois-
on of their own, producing dyspepsia, by
drying up the gastric juices, salivation,
sores, mercurial rheumatism, and often. *
necrosis of the bones.
Bowline Green, Sy., Mitchsll House.
Gentlemen:â For over four years I suf-
fered, greatly from a severe case of Con;,
tazious Blood Poison. I went to Hot
Springs, staying there four months at a
big 1 expense. I then consulted physi-
cians, who prescribed Jlercury. Noth-
ing did me any good, in fact the treat-
ment proved more harmful than benefi-
cial. Thus I continued to suffer for four
years. I mentioned my case to a friend,
who told me that S. S. S. had certainly
cured him. I at once commenced its use,
and in six months could find no trace
of the disease -whatever. This was about
two years ago/ and there has been no
signs of return. D. M. SA.2* DEBS.
S. S. S. , a remedy made from roots,
herbs and barks, is the only known an-
tidote : for Contagious Blood Poison. It
thoroughly and permanently eradicates
the poison from the blood so that no sign
is ever seen of the'disease 7 in ' future,
i S. S. S. builds up instead of tearing down
the system,- as do Mercury and Potash,
and when it has cured 'the disease every
; part \of the body - has been " toned ' np
by J; its purifying .' and tonic effects.

Xevr York Stock Market.
SE*T YORK. Sept. 18.â The advancing ten
cency ct prices which held through last week
Ms continued in to-4ay's stock market. The
DMjffUMNBt did not persist In full vigor through
cut the day, as it was interrupted by occa
t-.f.r.5.! halts and reactions, but there was no
actual reversal of the course ol prices. The
cay was \u25a0 without special incident in the way
of news, but advances . from all quarters were
corroborative cf the extraordinary prosperity
prevailing In &1I j.arts of the country and in
til lines of buttress. The money market of-
Icred co obstacles. Those who were operating
in the rrarket for higher prices arc satisfied,
apparently, co long as the necessary reduc
tion of loan by the clearing-house banks to
keep their deposits wiihin the , Segal reserve
can t>e effected by the relieving operations of
trust companies. The extent to which this pro
cees !s being carried does not entirely escape
criticism. Lniniediat* conditions in the
money market ehowed some relaxation to-day.
The Treasury withdrawal from the market was
less th*n in the corresponding period of last
week and New York exchange rose to par, in
dicating the lessened demand upon New York
basks. At the same time sterling exchange
i>:i away *o a lower level, and local banking
kV-uses were in active negotiations to secure
the opÂ©n market in London some jiart of
the incoming supr'iM; of gold. These negotia
tions were net euccessful. as the arrival of
p . i from India was reserved zgainst the In
dian currency. The gold was marketed in the
local markets and discoums there and In Ber
lin hardened an additional fraction. The Lon
don market is looking forward to a further
rise in the Bar.k ef England rate, and specu
lations there were consequently restrained. ,At
one time during the day it was definitely re
torted at the Stock Exchange that more goM
had been secured in London for shipment to
New York. The momentary strengthening ef
fect on stocks necessarily gave place to some
reselling when the rumor was found to' be
incorrect. The unbridled manner of the first
spurt in Reading had . a disturbing effect on
speculation. The movement in Canadian Pa
cific v.-j-s regarded as coining from the same
cources as that in Reading. Call money was
not held at tht maximum- level of Friday, but
ruied above-. laeL- week's level. Sterling ex
change movtd up from Hsj* low level In the
afternoon. The closing toue of stocks. was ir
rejruiar.

DESERTED WIFE
SEEKS REDRESS
Mrs. Charles McCauley Says
That Husband Left Her
After Taking Her Money
IS REFUSED A WAEKANT
Police Are Unable to Give
Auy Help to the Woman
Who Lost Small Fortune
Mrs. Charles McCauley called upon
Acting Captain of Detectives Harry
Reynolds yesterday, and sobblngly told
& story of deception practiced upon her
by the man- who is now her husband.
According to her statement McCauley
obtained from her sums of money ag
gregating, nearly $3000. which amount
he said he was investing In business
for himself and her. "When he had got
all he could from her hÂ© deserted her
and she declares he is now living with
another -woman, who claims to be his
\u25a0wife.
Mrs. McCauley Is left destitute. She
â¢yen pawned her Jewelry to get money
for the man who .deceived her, she al
. legee, and is now depend-nt upon rela
, tires for support.
Reynolds referred the woman to the
District Attorney's office, but she was
told there that there was no apparent
means of redress for her.
The unhappy woman met McCauley a
year and a half ago. At that time he
was employed about the "Winchester
.Hotel, where Mrs. McCauley, then a
widow, was staying:. She became fas
cinated by the man's smooth manner
and finally consented to marry him.
Almost immediately after the cere
mony had been- performed he asked for
money. "I want to start up in busi
ness," hÂ« said. He did not say. what
kind of business, but his wife had per
fect faith in him. She sold a house for
$1900 and turned the money over to
him. Shortly after, she states, her hus
band represented that he needed more
money "for the business." and she sold
a lot for J4OO. Later she sold a lodsr
ing house for $400. McCauley, the wife
declares, took all the money. He de
manded more and she sold what little
jewelry she had for $150."
This was her last resort to raise
money. When be saw that he had
obtained every cent she had, Mr 6. Mc-
Cauley asserts* he left. her. She hunted
-tiixn up and found that he was with an
other woman, who said that she was
Mrs. McCauley.
Then the unfortunate woman realised
that the had been basely deceived. She
immediately went to. police headquar
ters Though she was sympathized
with, *he was told that she has no
means of redress unless she can prove
the bigamy charge against her faith
less husband.
Scolding Upsets Lad.
Johnny Lynch, IS years, old. and
George Lynch, his i brother, 14 years
old," orphans residing with Mrs. Rose
Zeggani at S56 1 ,! Harrison street, are
employed at the American Canning
Company's plant. Yesterday John had
occasion to chide his brother for some
dereliction connected with his labors.
The younger brother took so much to
heart the reproving by his senior
â¢brother that he went into spasms over
it. It was then that the true brotherly
sympathy showed Itself. John had his
brother removed to the Central Emerg
ency Hospital for treatment, accom
panying him all the way and declining
to leave him until Dr. Frank T. Tillman
declared him out of danger. ,
Interpreter** Toe* Smashed.

being pushed along by some of the
stevedores on the Pacific Mail dock,

was taken to his home, 793 Pine street,
and T>r. 'Weeks of the Marine Hospital
Service was called. He found the man's
to*? had been badly smashed.. The doc
tor stated he thought the toes would

SOCIAL BANDIT
MUST GO AWAY
Police Eoinid Up ; Noted Im
postor Who Posed as Son of
Bellevue Hospital Surgeon
"DB." HUDSON IS BOOUS
Visits Summer Resorts and
Lures Daughter of Promi
nent Family by Fairy Tales
"Dr." C. H. Hudson, branded by the po
lite as a social highwayman, and adven
turer, was taken Into custody yesterday
end an effort will be made to force him
from the city. His picture has been added
to the collection in the rogues' gallery
and will be sent broadcast throughout the
land by the local headquarters.
Hudson Is an ex-soldler, but poses as
the son of the superintendent of Bellevue
Hospital, New York. Gifted with a strik
ing appearance and a glib tongue, he has
operated amonj the coast summer resorts
and more than one maiden has fallen vic
tim to his charms. Also more than one
pocket-book is said to have responded at
the request of the alleged rascal, and he
traveled and dressed as jone whose capital
was unlimited. Wturever he went he
forced his way into the most exclusive
sets and soon had a host of women wor
shipers about him. Men are also said to
have been attracted by his pleasing per
sonality and. one of these, residing In this
city. Is among the present list of com
plainants.
A short time ago Hudson met the
daughter of a prominent perfumery
merchant of this city at a re
sort. The pair became companions
after a brief acquaintance and when the
girl returned to this city it was under
stood by her parents that the two were
engaged. Father and mother did not ob
ject to the match, but felt rather com
plimented by It. "Dr." Hudson told tales
of his medical experience \u0084 under his
father's tutorage and boasted of his so
cial connections in New York. The
suitor followed the young lady here and
the attachment continued. About town
Hudson, found a number of influential
companions and he was introduced to a
number of good people.
Rumors started from some quarters,
however, and a short time ago the father
of the girl requested the local, police to
Investigate the standing of the man, who
sought his daughter's hand. Detectives
Bunner and Freel were put to work on
the case and in a very short time they
discovered that the man whose character
they were looking up was an Impostor of
the deepest dye and they immediately ar
rested him. It was discovered that no
such person as "Dr." Hudson ever man
aged the Bellevue Hospital and that the
prisoner knew nothing of medicine. Last
ly it was found that he Is an ex-soldier
and has been living with a woman on
Post street, near the corner of Taylor.
He admitted much when taken before
Acting Captain of Detectives Reynolds,
and will be' given an opportunity to leave
the city. Reynolds will not hold the man
because the people moat concerned in the
case refuse to prosecute. Because they
are of some prominence the acting captain
desires to spare them notoriety and will
not mention their names for publication.
JL T D(xE GKAHAM ASKS
FOR WILLING JURORS
Succeeds in Securing Record
Breaking Panel by Novel
Procedure.; '. :
An innovation was started yesterday, by
Judge Graham in Department 7 of
the Superior C6urt when he informed a
panel of 120 business men that provided
they would volunteer for Jury duty they
would be required to attend the trial of
two cases only. The experiment worked
to perfection, and out of the panel sev
enty-eight volunteered for duty, whereas
previously a like panel would bring only
twenty at the most. In addition to secur
ing fit and capable Jurors the plan will
insure the entire abolition of the profes
sional jury system. .
When the men summoned for Jury duty
appeared yesterday Judge Graham ad
dressed . them regarding the need ot
Jurors, and said that in order, to mitigate
the hardship of business men serving on
the' Jury he would ask them to attend
only two cases provided they volunteered.
Thosfe who failed to volunteer gave valid
excuses. i(iJ%Y'Â»^>^
Another departure from custom /was
taken by the Judge in the matter of
granting naturalization papers to foreign
ers when he "ordered that hereafter : the
court stenographer shall .be present to
take every statement.
. The order was the result of an applica
tion yesterday by Gustaf Ekberg, a na
tive of Sweden, for naturalization. Bk
berg was questioned by Judge Graham
and finally admitted that he could not
swear that he has been in America the
necessary five years. Ekberg's witness
also would not swear to the statement
and the Judge refused the papers. Ek
berg returned later, however, with an
other witness, who swore positively. that
Ekberg hat lived here five years, and the
papers were Issued.

JUDGE SHOCKS WOMAN
BY IMPOSING FINE.
Prior Dismissal of Co-DefÃimant
;Lea(is Her to Expect : MeFcy;; ;
His Honor; Declares Unchaste Language
Must Not Be Heard in HalL of Justice.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
With head bowed and- countenance ex
pressive of abject contrition, Mrs. Emma
Pell, middle-aged and pronouncedly bux
om, harkened .to Police. Judge Mogan
while he sharply chided her for having
disturbed the peace within earshot v of his
bench one morning about a week < ago,
but when he concluded a scathing perora
tion by fining her $25, with the alterna
tive of serving twenty-five days in prison,
her demeanor underwent a radical trans
formation. A gulping 'intake of breath
was followed by a prolonged exclamation
of "Mer-cy!"
Her utterance was not an appeal for
leniency. It was ebullient of surprise,
probably occasioned by the dismissal a
few moments previously ,of an' exactly
similar charge against "Jimmie" Lawler,
retired lightweight pugilist. She had not
j heard one of the bailiffs and an attorney
testify that she was the sole aggressor in
the unseemly wrangle that regaled the
corridor and shocked the court, and it
was apparent that when she stood up for
sentence the worst she expected was a
lecture topped off with a reprimand.
"Veil, ain'd dot der verst efer?" she
soliloquized when the Judge', waved his
left hand toward her, thereby announcing
that the incident was closed In so far as
it concerned him: Then shej?ald*'the fine.
Mrs. Pell and Mr. Lawler clashed over
her relentless prosecution of a young man
who had threatened j to slay \u25a0 a young
woman protege of hers. The meeting oc
curred at the door of ! the tribunal, and
disinterested witnesses testified' that Mrs;
Pell responded to Mr. La wler's. request
that shÂ« withdraw her complaint by
"roasting" him 1 ' with J language so un
chaste that he fled to escape It.
The Judge said pretty . much the same
thing to both Mrs. Pell and Mr. Lawler,
the burden of his censure being, that
words which might pass as proper in the
tenderloin or on the Barbary Coast were
reprehensible when launched within the
sacred precincts of the Hall of Justice. .
So impressed was Judge Mogan by, the
coherence and logic expressed in a.com
munication written to him by, Mrs. A. j B.
Kittell, a- patient in the: Napa Lunatic
Asylum, that -he', appointed' Attorney
Taafe to investigate the woman's claim
that she was perfectly sane and had been
Illegally committed. From her' husband,
a machinist residing at 1524 Nineteenth
avenue, the attorney ascertained that
after Mrs. Kittell had been exhaustively
interrogated she was formally consigned
to Napa by the Lunacy Commission, and
that she still labors under the single hal
lucination that caused her arrest. !
The unfortunate creature imagines that
the spirit of her former husband con
stantly abides with. her, and for hours at
a time she sits ,and silently communes
with it.' No other vagary - burdens 'her
mind and on every other subject she con
verses rationally. . \u25a0; '\u25a0\u25a0'â¢.â¢' \u25a0 \u25a0; '__;\u25a0â¢\u25a0 'V^i'.^

It was his miserable =punning on the
surname of a candidate for. the | Mayor
alty that led to the arrest! of | Robert H.
Davidson, a structural : iron worker, for
disturbing the peace Saturday, evening
at Washington and Stockton streets. â¢
"Why," he -asked a / man who was
awaiting a car and whom he. had ; never
knowingly met before \u25a0 that moment,
"why. is it a cinch that Mayor Schmltz
cannot be re-elected?" \u25a0
"Because,"., replied [' the stranger, "he
cannot 'get enough .votes. '-'.'"'
"No," rejoined Mr. Davidson; "if* be
cause the fellow who will run against
him is a bird." '[} ..-
The other man pondered ere he con
fessed Inability to understand what Mr.
Davidson meant. - â¢
"Don't catch H?"n Mr. Davidson
queried, somewhat crestfallen. "Schmltat
will run against Partridge, you . know.? ;;Â«. :
-"Well; what, has that to \u25a0 do i with what
you were . talking about a moment ago ?! '
was the counter query. ; v V,

warm, .retort. .' "Partridgeâbirdâbird

the man who had knocked him; down [was
non est, \u25a0 and he was \u25a0 swearing 'A fiercely
and nursing a ; swollen Jaw when the po
liceman arrested him.
"It .was an', awful i Joke," \ said j Judge
Fritz to Mr. Davidson, .'.'but I -think /you

petrating it. "\u25a0; Go s home/;\u25a0 -..>. \u25a0.-V.Lvv.'u- -,

upon; sixteen-year-old | Hazel ' Schoenan,
whose parents reside at 1204 Powhattan

ham told enough of their story to show
that Mr. Ellroyd is in a very serious posi
tion. The girl is detained in a- public in
stitution pending the outcome of the in
vestigation.
Ellroyd was captured in a Chinese
laundry on Stevenson street, between
Third and Fourth, whither he had been
pursued by the officers who found him
and the little girl locked in his apartment
at 275 Stevenson street. She disappeared
from her home last Tuesday, and not un
til Saturday, night was her whereabouts
discovered. ;. When the policeman T re
quested .' Ellroyd toi unlock the door of
the ' room * he asked If they were officers,'
and when they replied in the affirmative
he demanded to know if they had a.war

answer. ' \
"Then," he shouted, "get in if you
can." \u25a0 . ' \
\ Taking him at his word; the. pursuers
burst open the door, to find the ' child
alone in the room. An open window in
dlcated her recant companion's means of

one of tobacco found. ,
'Garrity was immediately taken into
