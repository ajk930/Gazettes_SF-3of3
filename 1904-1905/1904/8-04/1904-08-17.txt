ALBANY, Or.. Aug. 26.â The worst fire
in the history of Linn County Is sweep
ing down upon four settlements in the
eastern part of the county, and unless
the wind shifts or rain falls unexpect
edly the villages are doomed. The fire
is now utterly beyond control, though
hundreds of determined men are fight
ing the flames. Thirty square miles of
good timber have been burned over at
a loss of many thousands of dollars.
Gilbert Brothers' shingle mill, a num
ber of homes, farm buildings, etc.,
have been destroyed, though no fatali
ties have occurred thus far.
The fire started last week fourteen
miles from Lebanon, and began from
a campfire left burning by careless ber
ry pickers. The hamlets which seem
certain of destruction are Coster, Sweet
Home. Sodaville and Waterloo. The
flames have jumped three streams. The
fire. is of such breadth that it cannot
be checked at all points, and It carries

The Minister says that on August 1
several American merchants informed
him that President Nord had made
such a threat in a public audience. As
this report caused great alarm in all
classes. Minister Powell, at the request
of the merchants, saw the President
and asked as to the truth of the re
port. He replied that no statement of
that character had been made.
Minister Powell gives in detail an ac
count of the anti-Syrian movement.
He says the trouble originated in the
market, where a soldier, having made
some purchases for which he tendered
a dollar, was refused change.
The market people stood together and
attacked the soldiers, one of whom was
killed. For a time the situation looked
dangerous, as the soldler-s comrades
came from the barracks fullv armed
only to be met by a fully armed police
force.
Minister Powell hastened to General
Ferrera, the Minister for Foreign Af
fairs, and demanded protection for the
Syrians who were principally natural
ized Americans. He was told that the
disorders were owing to enemies of the
Government, especially to the friends
of the Haytian Bank prisoners. Presi
dent Nord sa'd that before he would
release these prisoners without trial he
would cut his own throat, but he prom
ised full protection to the foreigners in
HaytL ;Â¦ /
WASHINGTON. Aug. 16.â General
Nord never threatened to repeat the
massacre of foreigners in Hayti In
1904 according to Minister Powell, who
has the denial from the President's own
lips.
The Japanese are gradually advanc
ing against Kuropatkin's right wing,
but have so far to march before they
can become dangerous that for the
time being they are almost a negligible
quantity.
Kuropatkin has been reminded by the
general staff that the situation at sea
requires even greater caution in the
field than hitherto, and' that nothing
could excuse a failure to preserve the
main army intact for future operations
under less' unfavorable circumstances.
The food resources In the north have
proven much better - than expected.
The Russians monopolize the meat sup
ply in Mongolia, Flour, greenstuffs and
tea are abundant.
The mills of Harbin are grinding
enough lo supply the Russian army
without cutting . the ..non-combatant
supplies materially. Bran, millet and
beancake have been collected In quanti
ties sufficient for the autumn and win
ter.
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 16.â Once
more the war party, confronted by a
double naval catastrophe in the Far
East, invites the country to regard
what has occurred as. of little account
in the long run and. to concentrate its
hope upon the army.
Indeed, there is nothing else to do,
in view of the admitted plight of the
navy. It is a source of consolation that
the Russian soldiers fought with great
gallantry in the face of heavy odds and
many disc'ouragrements; but nobody ap
pears to believe the result for a mo
ment doubtful and few dispute the
magnificent behavior of the enemy.
Temporarily, at least, the navy is
eliminated from calculation and the
discussion revolves around the army in
Manchuria.
Kuropatkin is declared to possess a
perfect shield east of the railway as
far north as Yingfau, enabling him to
fight an effective rear guard action to
the south and southeast and still run
no rick of envelopment
The army is strongest on the left
wing, which may be described as the
pivot on which the Russian forces are
slowly swinging around from the south
and southeast. 'siT. s v

-ST. PETERSBURG. Aug. 16.â The
belief that Port Arthur Is doomed in
creases daily. It Is an open secret that,
while provisions are plentiful,, the am
munition expended since the beginning
of the war, is stupendous, and there
cannot be, a large supply.
. The official Viesenik publishes news
of another attack four days ago, the
result of which is unknown.
The news that the Vladivostok squad
ron has at last been tackled and badly
battered causes the Russ to lament
Russia's singular lack of fortune in the
war. The Birschewya, referring to the
attitude of England and America, says:
."It is hopeless to expect Europe to
intervene to prevent breaches of inter
national law. If these powers show
themselves' helpless, nothing can pre
vent other countries being drawn into
the war."
Strong hopes are entertained of the
Novik and Pallada reaching Vladivo
stok.
CHEFU, Aug. 16.â To-day's sortie of
the Russian warships from Port Arthur
is regarded as a confirmation of . pre
vious reports that the Japanese have
occupied . an Important land position,
the fire from which compelled the Rus
sian vessels to leave the harbor. It is
not certain that they returned to their
former anchorage after the sortie. It
is said, they did not encounter the Japa

from the entrance to Port Arthur.last

JAPANESE TROOPS OFF TO THE FRONTâ EMBARKATION' OF AN ARMY OF INVASION FROM -NAGASAKI*
By this time the crowd numbered
100 persons. The doomed men were
Jragged, the crowd shouting and cheer-
Ing, along the roadway to the Hodges
homestead. The heat was so intense
that the crowd wearied when two miles
of the six-mile route had been tra
versed. Going seventy-five yards from
the road, the crowd halted. The two
negroes were told they had but a short
time to live ar* that they should con-
Cess.
Reed confessed. Implicating other ne
iroes, as he had in the courtroom. He
1 The small guard about the prisoners
withdrew Into the room and closed the
door. The mob crashed against it,
bursting It easily. Cato, Reed, Handy
Bell and the other prisoners cowered
before the crowd. Cato and Reed alone
were dragged out. Reed was taken
down one stairway with a rope about
his neck and Cato down the other, both
pleading for their lives.
31 AKES A LAST CONFESSION.
At the front a member of the crowd
crept along the wall until he got close
to the guards. He threw himself upon
them. Into the breach thus formed his
companions threw themselves. Two
hundred wildly cheering men followed
and soon the soldiers, though they
fought desperately and inflicted bayo
net wounds upon some of their assail
ants, were overpowered.
Then Captain Hitch, of the Ogle
thorpe Light Infantry, who was in com
mand of the forces, realized that the
situation had become desperate. He
posted guards on each of the stair
nays that led to the floor above, where
the prisoners were congregated. With
Sxed bayonets, but unloaded rifles, the
guards stood. The mob surged toward
them, but was repulsed several times,
the determined effort was yet to be
ciade.
At the rear stairway the greatest
danger threatened. Prominent men,
among them the Rev. Mr. Hodges,
brother of the murdered man, sprang
to the front to address the crowd. He
begged its members to disperse. Sheriff
Kendrick cautioned the crowd against
violence and pleaded with it to leave,
declaring that five more men were
equally guilty with Cato and Reed, but
that only by information secured from
the condemned men could the others
be convicted. The crowd demanded
that he promise not to take the negroes
back to Savannah. This he declined
to do.
. Suddenly twenty-five men crowded
â¢round the guards. Before they could
be prevented they had caught two of
the guards, wrested their weapons
from them and thrown open the breech
locks. The weapons were empty.
GUARDS ARE OVERPOWERED
That was what the crowd wanted to
ascertain. The troops had been given
orders not to load their rifles. The
captured soldiers were held prisoners.
The same policy was followed with the
other soldiers. Man after man, caught
Isolated, was relieved of his rifle after
a struggle.
In the corridors the agitation began.
The spectators left the courtroom and
from the lawn outside many entered
the hallways. Shortly before 1 o'clock
the crowd was addressed by a tall
man, who seemed to inname it greatly.
He called upon those about him to fol
low him.
The climax came quickly and unex
pectedly. The forenoon had been passed
quietly; â¢ ihe trial -oY Paul' Ke'ed, the
ringleaaer, being concluded and a ver
dict of guilty rendered. Both he and
Will Cato, found guilty yesterday, were
sentenced to be hanged on September
:*. The crowd about the courthouse
was not as large as yesterday, nor was
It so threatening, though for that mat
ter there was never much parade, the
countrymen always being quiet.
In the trial of Heed little delay had
been caused and on its conclusion the
prisoners, as before, were hurried into
the witness room, where a strong mili
tary guard was placed over them.

in which the guard finally stood with

Reed and Cato."
Cato screamed in agony and begged
that he be shot. His heavy suit or
hair, which was oil-soaked, was almost
the first thing the flames fastened on,
while the rope became a collar of fire
around his neck. For only about three
minutes was he visible to the crowd
before the great pile of fagots made
a wall of flame which the wind wrap
'ped around his body, hiding it from
view. Before the/ flames progressed
very far his head' sank forward. Ap
parently the fire had reached his lungs
and killed him.
As soon as it was seen the men were
dead the crowd commenced dispersing.
A large number remained behind, how
ever, piling more fuel on until both
bodies were burned to a cinder.
DEPUTIES AID. THE MOB.
The spectacle was frishtful. As the
flames touched Reed's naked oil-soaked
skin, he twisted hi9 head around in an
endeavor to choke himself and avoid
thf fearful torture. Only once did he
complain. .* He said:
"Lord, have mercy."
The crowd moved across a field to a
strip of woodland. One man made a
speech recounting the horrors of the
crime. This innamed the mob to a
frenzy.
To a larse stump twelve feet high
the men were chained. Then a wagon
load of pine wood was hauled to the
spot. It was piled around the men and
ten gallons of kerosene was thrown
over them.
A photographer was present and the
crowd was cleared back that he might
get several views of the men bound to
the stake and ready for the burning.
Just as the match was applied to the
pyre one of those in front asked Reed
if he wanted to tell the truth before he
died.
"Yes, sir. I killed Mr. and Mrs.

"Who killed the children?" he was
asked.

PARIS, Aug. 16. â Russia's protest
against the Japanese violation of Chi
nese neutrality at Chefu has been
transmitted to the Mikado's Govern
ment bv the French legation in To
kio, -Â»cting purely as the intermediary
of. Russia, which has not made any
representations to France on the sub
ject.
Russia's Protest Forwarded.
"Never in the history of the bureau
has there been so great a demand.
This, despite the fact that throughout
the last four years more women have
been coming to this country than
men."
At the various missions where im
migrant girls are cared for the same
story is told. In one Instance it ia
stated there are fifty applications for
every available servant.

Japan Losing China's Friendship.
TIENTSIN, Aug. 16. â The reported
violation by Japan of the neutrality
of China in the capture ofr the Rus
sian torpedo-boat destroyer Ryeshitel
ni at Chefu has resulted in alienating
to a great extent the sympathy of Chi
nese officials for Japan. This applies
even to officials connected with the
pro-Japanese party.
Belated reports from various vessels
continue to reach Admiral Togo. The
Japanese destroyers and torpedo boats
made a series of attacks during the
pursuit of the Russian warships. One
destroyer reports that she hit a vessel
of the Pallada type and it is believed
the vessel foundered and that the en
tire erf w were either killed or drowned.
Admiral Togo, in reporting to the ad
miralty, says It appears certain that
the Pallada was sunk. It was believed
at first that the Pallada escaped south
ward with the Novik and Askold, the
admiralty believing she was concealed
inÂ«thje yiclnitv of the Yangtse river.
.Whatever her fate, it soon will be
determined. If she is afloat she will
speedily be' reported and if destroyed
it Is probable that some of her wreck
age will be found.
TOKIO, Aug. 16.â It seems certain
that the Russian protected cruiser Pal
lada was torpedoed and sunk during
the naval battle of August 10. She fail
ed to return to Port Arthur and has
not been reported since Admiral Togo's
fleet departed on various missions on
the night of August 10, when the Rus
sians retreated.
Vice Admiral Togo Believes the Rus
sian Cruiser Foundered.
PALLADA MAY HAVE BEEN SUNK.

LONDON, Aug. 16. â What. Is con
sidered in Government circles here to
be not the least important feature of
the British note delivered to Russia
to-day is that dealing with the ques
tion of contraband. Great Britain re
iterates the suggestion that the regu
lations issued by the Emperor defin
ing the rights of Russian warships to
ward neutral vessels carrying alleged
contraband should be modified and
particularly urges a revision of the list
of articles declared contraband. Be
cause of her dependence on foreign
countries for food Great Britain made
an especially strong objection to the
inclusion of rice and foodstuffs gen
erally.
During the exchanges of communi
cations it has been the contention of
Russia that in her regulations such
foodstuffs only become contraband if
"intended for war purposes or if sent
at an enemy's cost or order." Rus
sia further points out that this is
along lines laid .down by the United
States in the case of the steamship
Mashona, at the time of the Boer war.
The officials of the Foreign Office
are reticent as to the length to which
the Government has gone In respect
to the status of foodstuffs in time of
war, but it is said in a reliable quar
ter that the British note advances be
yond the position laid down in the
Mashona case and that all foodstuffs
are now practically declared, in the
British view, to be not liable to seiz
ure. If this statement proves correct
Continental diplomats say the declara
tion will meet with a cold reception on
the Continent.

to Contraband of War.

SACRAMENTO. Aug. 16.â Engineer
Louis Graham, who was iniured by
falling from an engine near Summit
Sunday night, died at the Railroad
Hospital to-day. Graham intended
that when he had brought the over
land limited over the mountains Sun
day night he should retire permanently
from the railroad service.
He had arranged to take his family
on an Eastern trip and they had pro
cured the tickets and were preparing
to begin their journey.
An engineer was required to take the
overlar.d limited out of Sacramento
on Sunday, and Graham, one of the
best men on the road, offered to do it.
As his train neared Summit he went
out on the running board to examine
eome of the mechanism, when he acci
dentally fell, striking on his head.
Death resulted from this injury. Gra
ham was a prominent member of Sac

ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 16.â Reports
from the Governors of Radom and
Fyedlet*. Russian Poland, which have
Wen received by the police department
of the Ministry of the Interior state
that the reports of Jewish massacres in
the small Polish towns of Parchevo and
Ostrovetz arose from affrays between
the Jewish and ChVistian inhabitants,
In which the Jews in both cases were
the aggressors. Only one Jew suc
cumbed to his injuries.
The disturbance at Parchevo took
li!ace on July 23 and was the result of
an attempt by the Jews to kidnap a
converted Jewess, Antoniona Koorn, 18
years old.
About three months ago . the girl
evinced a desire to become a Catholic,
and left her l^arents, going to Lublin,
Â¦\\ here she remained for several weeks
In an industrial home receiving religious
instruction. Her parents in the mean
time endeavored to persuade her to re
turn to them, and not being successful
resorted to the stratagem of accusing
the girl of the theft of 90 rubles ($45) in
cider that the authorities would be
compelled to send her back for trial.
During the trial a crowd of Jews
numbering several thousand rushed
into the courtroom and. despite the ef
forts < of the officers to protect her,
prized the girl and carried her off. They
also wrecked the building where the
trial was held. The grirl was locked up
in a brewery, from which she was. sub
sequently liberated l>y a crowd of
Christians and sent back to Lublin.
The girl declares that she saw a close
ly fhuttered room in the brewery, where
n!<i men had assembled in rabbis' dress
ready to try her, and she begged her
.captors not to torture, but to kill her.
The wounded in the disturbance In
cluded twenty-nine Jews, but the mu
nicipal surgeon declares that none were
<3angerou?ly wounded. The Christians
did nÂ«t report their Injuries, fearing
prosecution.
The public prosecutor summoned ten
Jews, of whom two escaped.
The incidents at Ostrovetz date back
to July 21 and 22. A Jewish boy threw
a stone at a Polish beggar, striking
Jiim on the head. The beggar's broth
er, a factory hand, fell upon a few
Jow5 in order to avenge his brother's
injuries. The Jews were reinforced,
end then other factory hands joined in
the fight, which soon was stopped by
she police.
The next day COO factory hands en
tered the town, stoning the houses of
the Jews and attacking the Jews in the
Ftrffts, wounding three, one of whom
died.

SAN BERNARDINO, Aug. 16.â Two
Yaqui Indians tried to kill two Ital

succeeded in dispatching one of their
victims. One of the injured men and
one of the Indians who were working
together got drunk. In the quarrel
that ensued the Indian broke his an
tagonist's jaw and felled him to the
ground with a stick of wood four feet
long and three inches in diameter, in
flicting a probably fatal wound.
The fight was seen by a one-armed
Italian, who ran off to secure assist
ance for his countryman. Another
Indian met him at the brow of the
hill and sailed into the one-armed
man with a machete. The Italian
fought off the Indian with a rock to

and taken to the county jail, but the
other escaped.

CANADA MAKES COMPLAINT
ABOUT INSULT TO FLAG*
OTTAWA, Ontario. Aug. 16.â The
Canadian Government has lodged &
formal complaint with the British au
thorities regarding the Indignity of
fered to the flag of the Dominion by
a British consular officer in a South
American port a.few_weeks-agd.. .The
flag was torn' and trampled on and
the Consul said he knew nothing of a
Canadian flag.
Deserters from the Hereros reported
that the arrival of German reinforce
ments at Swakopmund caused great de
pression in the native camp. Chief Sam
uel spent much time in having the
Bible read to him.
General von Trotha doubtless will fol
low up his success and finish the re
bellion with the Waterberg campaign.
It seems improbable that many of
the natives can have escaped through
the German forces holding the moun
tain pawes.
In a skirmish preceding the battle a
patrol commanded by Lieutenant Baron
von Bodenhausen was surprised and
tho lieutenant and eight men were
killed. :.. .
Five German officers, including Count
von Arnim. and nineteen men were
killed. Six officers, among them Baron
von "Watter, and fifty-two men were
wounded. Two are missing.
The natives, who numbered about
6000 fighting men. under old Chief Sam
uel Maherero, to whom the younger
leaders had turned after their former
reverses, were concentrated in the
Waterberg Mountains. With their
women, children and flocks, they occu
pied a plain or meadowland roughly
estimated at 650.000 acres, on which
they had 5000 head of cattle and 50,000
sheep, goats, etc. The approaches to
the plain were difficult passes, so that
the Germans had severe work forcing
them. The number of the Germans is
not accurately known, but as nine com
panies and four and a half batteries,
with some irregular troops, were en
gaged, the total probably was about
2000 men.
BERLIN, Aug. 16.â Four columns of
German troops attacked the Hereros
near Hamakari, German Southwest Af
rica, on the night of August 11. The
fighting continued all day August 12.
The natives were defeated with heavy
losses.
The correspondent says that the
statement that 87 of the crew were
killed is incorrect.
The Peking correspondent of the
Times, in a dispatch, dated August 15.
says the note of the Russian Govern
ment demands that China shall re

ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 17. â Pub
lic anxiety, regarding the fate of the
ships of Rear Admiral Withoeffs
squadron remaining unaccounted for
is still unrelieved. St. Petersburg con
tinues to be entirely .dependent- upon
foreign sources for. news, the Russian
authorities "claiming to be quite as
much in the dark aa the public. The
Admiralty neither confirms nor de
nies the report that a majority of the
squadron returned to Port Arthur, al
though it does not fail to point out
that only the most desperate situation
after the. sea fight could have com
pelled the vessels to return for refuge
to that- port.
Nothing has been received from
Russian sources regarding the report
from Chefu of a sortie of the Port
Arthur warships to-day. The report
may refer to the cruiser Bayan and
the. pun boats and torpedo-boat de
stroyers left in the harbor and one or
two of Admiral Withoeffs ships which
vere forced to limp back to the port
after the fight of August 10.
The report of the sinking of the
cruiser Rurik is accepted as true in
official circles and the public had been
prepared for a definite announcement
by the publication this afternoon of a
report thai she had been grievously
df.maged. The authorities, out of con
sideration for the families of the of
ficers and sailors, decided to withhold
an official announcement until they
have received an official report upon
the return of the cruisers Rossia and
and Gromoboi to Vladivostok.
The opinion is growing that the

"When a man begins to grow old he
usually begins to feel sick in many ways.
Old people soem to expect this. I don't
believe the Almighty intended that the
old should be sick. I was sick with
rheumatism, pain in back, hips and legs,
stiff knees and ankl* joints â I could not
eat. I was weak. My bladder was Irri-
table. I had to get up often at night I
thought these troubles were the penalty
of getting old. because I had taken much
medical treatment without benefit. I be-
came so miserable, however, that I de-
cided as a last resort to try the Electro-
Chemlc treatment â so. on Feb. 21. 1903.
I went to the Electro-Chemlc Institute.
US Grant avenue, San Francisco, for
consultation and examination.
Everything was so satisfactory, no
charge for examination, a free loan of
the wonderful Electro-Chemic apparatus
for home treatment, a small charge for
treatment, and in three months* time I
was perfectly cured, and I did not havo
to remain in the city at all. as my treat-
ment was all done by the home method.
I am glad I went for the first examina-
tion, for that was Just the thing and It
showed at once what was the matter
with me. and after that my cure was
comparatively easy. I can truthfully
say that I feel twenty years younger
since taking the Electro-Chemlc course.
My pains are all gone. I can eat like a
horse and digest everything I eat. and I
feel pretty strong for a man that is get-
ting way long in years.
My name is R. B. Cutting and T llv<*
at Santa Cruz. Cal. I am an old pioneer
and I want to recommend the Electro-
Chemic treatment to all sufferers and
especially to the old folks who are mis-
erable and sick. Medicines do no good in

CHICAGO, Aug. 16.â The general de

Mrs. Klecka and her husband were

strike began the family was reduced
to destitution and five children were
?adly in need. The mother died on Sat
urday.
The strikers assisted in the funeral
arrangements, and when the procession
started for Concordia Cemetery to-day
it had the nature of a labor union
event. Crowds lined the streets, and
at the union headquarters the line halt

BOSTON', Aug. 16.â If anything were
needed to prov-e- that the Grand Army
of the Republic is still in fact a mighty
host, it was to be found to-day, when,
with half a million civilians looking
on, 26,000 survivors of the Union forces
of the Civil War assembled here from
all sections of the United States,
and marched through the streets of
Boston. Five and one-half hours were
required for the parade to pass a given
point.
It was a severe strain on the old
soldiers, but generally the veterans
bore the' hardship well. More than
three score of them dropped from the
ranks from exhaustion and heat pros
tration and were cared for at the hos
pitals. The death of one old soldier
marred the otherwise happy day. Col
onel John P. Pyron, a member of John
A. Dix Post of New York, died from
heart failure induced by exhaustion. At
least 250 spectators, mostly women,
fainted during the parade and many
persons were slightly injured and had
their clothing torn in the crush.
The spectacle presented by the
marching gray-haired soldiers was one
calculated to thrill and everywhere the
army was received with applause.
As the columns of blue swept up
Beacon Hill, closely following the
northerly side of the famous Boston
Common, they were reviewed from the
State House by Governor Bates, who
was accompanied by distinguished
personages, including Governor Van
Sant of Minnesota, Former Governors

REPUBLICAN NOMINEE IN THE THIRD
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT TO SUC
' CEED METCALF.
That the Flint. forces were in com
mand of the convention there is no
doubt, but whether the nominees of
the various Assembly and Senatorial
districts will consider themselves
bound by the instructions which were
given them, not by their respective
districts but by the convention as a
whole, which had nothing to do with
the various districts, is a question.
Upon that question depends the
complexion of the Southern California
delegation in the next Legislature.
Frank P. Flint will have a large ma
jority of the vote of this county, more
than the Bard people had thought
possible, but whether he will have a
sullicient number will depend upon
the construction which the various
nominees put upon the instructions
given them. In only two Assembly
districts were positive Instructions
given the nominees for Assemblymen
1 to vote for anybody.- In the Sixty
eighth District Assemblyman W. A.
Johnstone was directed to vote for
Bard regardless of other candidates;
in the .Seventy-third J. P. Transue was
instructed to vote for Flint.
The other nominees are not bound
by any other instructions than those
given them by the convention as a
whole, and when the time comes they
probably will vote as they see fit. Cer
tain it is that Bard has not more than
lour certain votes from Los Angeles
County and he may have only two; of
the latter number he is assured. The
Los Angeles delegation in the next
Legislature will be as follows, the
preference for United States Senator
being also given:
ASSEMBL.YMEN.
Elxty-soventh District â John A. Goodrich,
claimed by. both sides, probably for Bard.
SIxiy-eighth District â W. A. Jolmstone, for
Bard.
Sixty-ninth Districtâ X. W. Thompson of Al
harabn. claimed by both sidee, probably tied
Up to .Flint.
Seventieth Districtâ William Wlckersham of
San Pedro, for Flint
Seventy-first District â P. A. Stanton, for
Flint.
Seventj'-s 'cone" District â H. S. O. McCart-
Dey. for Flint
Seventy-third Districtâ J. P. Transue. for
r:int.
Seventy- fourth District â Fred Houser for
Flint.
Seventy-fifth District â J. H. Krlraminger. for
Flint.
STATE SENATORS.
Thirty-fifth Districtâ H. A. Broughton, for
Bard.
Thfrty-eeventh Districtâ H. E. Carter for
Flint.
An analysis of the foregoing ticket
shows that Bard will receive the cer
tain support of the Assemblyman in
the Sixty-eighth District and the Sen
ator in the Thirty-fifth District. He is
reasonably certain of the vote of Good
rich in the Sixty-seventh Assembly
District, and may get the support of
Thompson in the Sixty-ninth Assembly
District, but that is all ha can hope to
get from Los Angeles County. His
managers have stated throughout the
campaign that If Bard can carry three
votes from Los Angeles he will win,
but they have refused to give any other
figures. He is certain of two votes and
may get a third, but that is not by any
means certain. Even If he gets it the
vote of Los Angeles County will stand
(counting the hold-over Senators),
Flint 11, Bard 3.
Thompson of Alhambra has been
pledged in the Sixty-ninth District to
both sides, but how he stands person
ally is known only to himself, and he
will not talk.
Relying on their strength in the
whole body and without dividing it
among the Assembly and Senatorial
districts, the county cenvention as a
whole passed a resolution instructing
for Flint, and in order to forestall any
resolution in the various smaller con
ventions In favor of any other candi
date a resolution was adopted to the
effect that all resolutions presented be
referred without reading to the com
mittee on resolutions of the general
convention. This was, of course, a po
litical trick, because the county con
vention as such had nothing: whatever
to do with the various district conven
tions, but the trick worked, and the re
sult was that only In the Johnstone
district was a resolution opposing Flint
adopted.
It is claimed by the Flint supporters
that to-day's convention settles the
Senatorial fight, but the Bard workers
do not admit that that is true. The
fact that no specific instructions were
given the various candidates except as
before Indicated leaves the matter open.
The present Indications are that when
the Southern California legislative del
egation meets to caucus on the Sena
torial question the unin3tructed dele
gation of three from San Diego County
will hold the balance of power, and
upon that condition may hinge the
Congressional fight between Ward and
Smith In the Eighth Congressional Dis
trict.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 16. â The Re
publican county convention was held
to-day and the result is not particu
larly* favorable to the aspirations of
Senator Bard for re-election.' This is
not another way of saying that the
forces behind the candidacy of Frank
P. Flint have won the day, because
the result of the Southern California
vote, or even the vote of Los Angeles
County, cannot be definitely deter
mined."
Special Dispatch to The Call
The council brand of the Great Coun
cil of the Degree of Pocahontas was
also kindled yesterday in the tepee on
Post street. There were present about
150 representatives, also all. the preat
chiefs. Great Pocahontas Minnie Betts
presiding. The entire forenoon session
was .taken, up in organization, and in
the afternoon the reports of the great
Pocahontas and other great chiefs were
presented and read. The reports show
the institution of eleven new councils
and an increase of 1320 members during
the last great sun. One council was
reorganized.
This forenoon there will be the elec
tion of great chiefs for l the ensuing
term. Mrs. Annie M. Bliss of this city.
The other great chiefs presented their
reports, the reading of which occupied
the entire session. *
J. J. Bryan of Manzanita Tribe. Wil
liam Mdran of Modoc Tribe and W. T.
Lyons of Altahmos Tribe were ap
pointed a committee to select three
teams from among the local tribes to
exemplify before the Great Council the
work of the three degrees.
At 11 o'clock to-day the special order
of business will be the election of great
chiefs for the ensuing great sun. In the
natural order of things C. S. Davis of
Angels' Camp should, by reason of the
fact that he occupies the second high
est position In the order,, become the
next great sachem, but there is some
talk of placing in opposition to him
one of the past great sachems, who
during his incumbency proved himself
one of the most energetic and popular
chiefs the order ever had. A. D. Mason
will undoubtedly be advanced to the
stump of great senior sagamore. It is
stated that for the station of great
junior sagamore there will be several
candidates, the most prominent being
Julius S. Godeau of Seminole Tribe of
this city.' The great contest will be for
the office of great chief of records,
there being three candidates in the field
â Porter L. Bliss, the incumbent; Fred
B. Swan and Oscar Seavey. There are
a number who seek the smaller chief
taincies and the honor of being chosen
as representative to the Great Cobncil
of the United States.
COUNCIL BRAND KINDLED.
From the long talk of the great chief
of records. Porter L. Bliss, it appears
that during: the last twelve moons the
net increase was 1972, making the total
membership in this reservation 13,177.
The amount paid for relief of brothers
of the. order during that period was
$47,865 'and amount paid for the burial
of the' dead _was $8087. The assets of
the order amount to $214,726. His talk
also showed that the banner tribe in
membership Is Altahmos No. 87 of this
city, with 455 members at the close
of the reports to the speaker's office.
Iroquois No. 35 of Stockton follows
next with 423 members. Of the 95 tribes
forty-nine have a membership in ex
cess of 100.
The council fire of the thirty-ninth
great sun session of the Great Council
of California, Improved Order of Rea
Men, was kindled in the Long House
at 320 Post street, yesterday forenoon
at 10 o'clock by order of Great Sachem
Jacob Samuels. All great chiefs were
at their respective stumps on the fall
of the tomahawk calling the represen
tatives together.
After the routine of opening thÂ«
Great Council for the transaction of
business the great sachem made his
long talk to the great representatives.
It was an exhaustive review of the
work of the past great sun. He con
gratulated the order upon the growth
it has made, the number of adoptions
being 35D9, but regretted that there was
the report of many suspensions and he
urged all tribes to do all that can be
done to prevent suspensions In future.
He expressed himself In favor of an
organizer to build up the order in this
reservation where no tribes exist. He
stated .that the order has grown to
such dimensions that the great sachem
cannot visit all the tribes and urges
that the work be divided between the
four leading treat chiefs. He com
mended the work of the recently estab
lished Board of Relief in this city,
spoke In high terms of the Incumbent
great chief of records and urged that
when a competent official is secured
for that very Important chieftaincy,
"the fraternal crown should not be
torn from his brow." Much of his
talk was devoted to official acts.
SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS YEAR,
It is predicted in the Republican camp
that Roosevelt will get 50,000 majority
In California and thp.t a solid Republi
can Ooncrr^sional delegation will be
chosen. Two years aero the bitter fight
between thÂ«> <Jage and anti-Gage fac
tions divided the Republicans, and Con
gressional nominees of the party who
did not hesitate tu oppose the Gage
machine were knifed at the polls. In
this campaign harmony and enthu-
Firism abound ar.d all voters of â¢ the
party are 'in line for a delegation of
oi^ht Republicans to represent Califor
nia in the House of Representatives.
Tho State Central Committee and the
County Committee of the party will
hold a conference at Santa Cruz next
Â¦week for the discussion of many topics
connected with the r.irr.paigrn. General
Gr-orge Stone, chairman of the State
Committee, is confident of the party's
Jibillty to win in every Congressional
district.
The entire Democratic Congressional
ticket may be named at Santa Cruz
n^xt week. As' the Fourth is the only
district that the Democrats are confi
dent of winning more than ordinary
interest applies to the contest in that
political subdivision. It is gossip in po
litical circles that E. J. Livernash will
be the Democratic nominee, and it is
common rumor that the Republicans
will again nominate Juiius Kahn. Many
of the Republican leaders assert that
Kahn can vAn out.
It is said that the organization will
keep its hands off the Congressional
conventions so that the districts may
proceed with nominations without
fup^estion or interference. The Dem
ocrats expect to put up a vigorous
tight in the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth
districts. All other districts are prac
tically conceded in advance to the Re
publicans.
The Democratic State Convention
will meet in Santa Cruz next Monday.
Former Lieutenant Governor William
T. Jeter, who dwells in Santa Cruz,
may be elected chairman by acclama
tion. At the May conversion of the
party Governor Jeter was a candidate
for the honors of the chairmanship in
opposition to Frank H. Gould. As
Gavin McNab controlled the party or
ganization then, as now, and desired
to perpetuate such control, he cast his
influence against Jeter's candidacy
and Gould was chosen chairman.
Gould made good later on by appoint
ing an executive committee which
gave McNab control of the new Dem
ocratic State Central Committee. Mc-
Nab may now deem it expedient to en
courage the candidacy of Jeter for the
chairmanship, as the latter is a pol
ished gentleman of the old school of
dignified politicians and, being a res
ident of the convention city, his elec
tion as presiding officer would be ac
cepted as a compliment to Santa Cruz.
McXab's title to the control of the
party works for the next two years
cannot be disturbed by the com
ing convention. The majority of the
delegates, however, will be governed
by a programme to be devised by Gav
fn McNab, Timothy Spellacy. Thomas
J. Walsh. Franklin K. Lane, Frank H.
Gould. Isidore Dockweiler. J. C. Sims
nnd Thomas J. Geary. These party
leaders will also hand out the names
of ten men for Presidential electors on
the Democratic ticket.

Afftr the convention adjourned 'the
delegates vlsted the Mare Island navy
yard as the guests of the citizens of
Vallejo, and Knowland, accompanied
by his wife and little daughter, took a
trip over the great naval plant that
will become his especial care after the
next election.
The following members of the Con
gressional committee were selected by
the convention:
It took the convention but a few mo
ments to make tht? nomination of
Knowland unanimous, and the young
Alamc-dan told his friends about his
hopes and aspirations for his career in
Congress. He was modest and earnest
and he told those who had gathered
to make him a leader In the party ranks
that he wanted to be judged, not by
his promises, but by his deeds.
"I have had enough experience," he
said, "in public life to know that a man
is not Judged by what he pVomises, but
by what he does. I am willing to stand
upon vhat I have done in' the State
Legislature, and should I be fortunate
enough to go to the national legisla
ture I am willing to stand upon what
I accomplish there. 1 consider it an
honor to know that I have the friend
ship and the confidence of the Hon.
Victor H. Metcalf, and I can assure my
friends here present that I will never
do anything that will violate /that con
fidence. I shall endeavor to/follow the
example and steps of the man who has
preceded me in this position, and who,
by his acts, has brought honor to the
State of California."
This loft the way clear for the most
important part of the work of the con
vention â the nomination of the Con
gressman. It devolved upon Dr. C. L.
Tisdaie of Alameda to put his friend
and fellow-townsman in. nomination,
and this he did in a very graceful
speech. Dr. Tisdaie presented the name
of Joseph EL Knowland to the dele
sates a? "One of the best friends I ever
had, and a man who is every way wor
thy to represent the great Republican
party In the hall of the national leg
islature." Dr. Tisdaie paid Knowland
a great compliment in a very few
words, saying that he was a*man who
knew his friends and his party, and
who would do both credit.
The nomination of Knowland was
seconded by Frank W. Leavitt of Ala
meda County, J. W. Tinning of Contra
Costa County and George \V. Morton
of Solano County. Mr. Leavitt attested
the ability of Knowland, having served
several s^fsIods .in the State Legisla
ture with him. i

tor II. Metcalf as Congressman and
Joseph R. Knowland as State legisla
tor. The platform attested the former

Knowland of Alameda was to-day
named by the Republicans to be their
Btandard-bearer in the Third Congres
sional District. The gathering of the
Republican clans of the district was
in the nature of a lovefeast, and there
was not a note of discord or inharmony
In the proceedings of the day.
It was a battle cry for Republican
success from the moment that thÂ«
Alameda County delegates landed in
Vallejo until their work was completed,
and the man had been named who will
represent the Third California District
In the halls of Congress.
The navy yard city had been named
as the meeting place of the convention
and the Alameda County delegates,
who composed more than three-quar
ters of the convention, were taken to
Vallejo on a special boat. The Solano
and Contra Costa delegates were al
ready on the ground when the Ala
meda delegates arrived, and the or
ganization of the convention took but
a short time. J. W. Evans of Oakland
was chosen for tsmporary chairman
and William McDonald of Livermore
as temporary secretary. With the ap
pointment of the following commit
tees the noontime adjournment was
taken:

No other charge was entered
against any of the men, but the three
officers were the first ever broken for
the charge of being off their beats.
The Novelty is the same saloon that
was. robbed on the morning of March
21 last. Three policemen, Peter Cha
pelle, G. W. Nightingale and E. W.
Gardner, were accused by Special
Watchman William Watson of enter
ing the place. Watson, who patrols
the First-street beat, claimed to have
seen three policemen, who he thought
were the above named, come out of
the saloon on the morning that the
burglary took place, carrying bundles.
An investigation was made and it
was found that the three officers had
been absent from . their beats on the
morning of the burglary. They were
subsequently tried before the Police
Commission on charges of being oft
their beats and dismissed from the
force.
The burglary was discovered by the
early morning bartender yesterday
morning. The thieves had completely
ransacked the place, taking a quantity
of the best brands of liquors and ci
gars. Everything was turned upside
down. The till was broken open and
about $45 in cash taken from it. The
shelves containing the reserve stock
of whisky and wines were almost dev
astated and every good cigar in the
house was confiscated.
The matter was reported to Captain
Martin yesterday and detectives were
detailed on the case. No clew to the
identity of the burglars has been dis
covered. Entrance was gained by
climbing through the rear transom by
means of a ladder, the same method
that was adopted when the place was
robbed before. Then the thieves got
into the saloon by picking the lock of
the front door.
The Novelty saloon on the north
west corner of First and Mission
streets, owned by Daniel Â¦ E. Collins,
was entered and burglarized some
time during Monday night and 5500

The burglars' special fa-ncy was the
silver plate that has been in the fam
ily for more than a century. Among
the things taken was the spoon referred
to, bearing the date 179S; a cup en
graved with the name "Lawrence Cole,"
a gravy ladle marked "J. B." and an
other cup marked "Julie's Baby."
When Mrs. Cole was notified by the
San Francisco police of Wilson's cap
ture she went at once to the city and
identified the heirlooms found in the
fellow's possession and recovered from
his room. Wilson is an ex-convict who
was only lately released after , serving
a sentence of five years for burglary.
The Co'e home was robbed while the
family slept late Sunday night. None
of the family were aware of the visita
tion until yesterday morning, wh.en
on<Â» of the early risers in.the household
discovered that the house had been ran
sacked. The downstairs rooms were
turned topsy-turvy, but the upper
rooms were left undisturbed. Mrs.
Cole thinks she scared the burglars
away unwittingly when she arose in
the night, else they would have got
away with more booty.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Aug. 16.
Because a Hawaiian woman, a friend
of her husband, called her a "a fat,
fussy old thing" over the telephone,
.Clara King Graham was granted a di
vorce, to-day by Judge Melvin from
Joseph A. Graham, a Government en
gineer, employed in San Francisco at
a salary of $125 a month.
The first intimation Mrs. Graham
had that her husband waa not true to
her waa one day when, she says,
a dark complexloned woman called at
the house and asked for hlnru The
woman made no secret of her regard
for Graham and the wife had a fit of
nervous prostration when the truth
dawned upon her.
The divorce was granted on the
ground of cruelty and was not con
tested by Graham. They were married
in Sacramento in 1S93. For the last
few years they have been living in
Berkeley. They have three children,
of which she was awarded the custody
and was also allowed $60 a month ali
mony.
Her alleg-ations of cruelty consisted
in the fact of the mental anguish
caused by her husband's actions and
because the woman of whom he was
enamored would call him up at his
home and often she talked rudely to
the plaintiff.

OAKLAND. Aug. 16. â Auditor A.
H. Breed has requested a formal
opinion from City Attorney McElroy
concerning the effect that his action
in handling the bills of the Contra
Costa "Water Company would have on
the litigation in the United States Cir
cuit Court. The Auditor will decide
definitely to-morrow whether he will
issue the warrants. It is generally
thought he has no alternative but to
draw the warrants in view of the in
junction of .the Federal court. That
waa the view taken by Mayor Olney
and City Attorney McElroy when they
ordered the bills paid under protest.
At the City Hall It is expected Auditor
Breed will feel compelled to follow
this course and to draw his warrants
"under protest." Such a move would
protect the city in event of a decision
in its favor in the litigation that is
pending over this year's water rates.

NEW YORK, Aug. 16.â Detectives
are working on another bis jewelry
robbery, according to circulars received
to-day by jewelers, pawnbrokers and
money lenders in New York and other
large-cities. The value of the missing
articles is not nearly so great as in
the Goelet case. Descriptions of the
theft are similar to that sent out in the
Goelet case, however, in that no name
is given of the person robbed nor Is any
reward offered for the arrest and con
viction of the thieves. It seems to be
another case in which the owners will
be satisfied with the return of the
stolen property.
The circular says that all advances
made on. the jewels described will be
refunded and recompensatlon paid for
any trouble that may be necessary.
The circular says that the Jewelry was
stolen on July 7 last. On that date
the safe of the Clark estate at Coopers
town was robbed of valuable jewels
and private papers.
The fourth article in the list of stolen
jewelry is described thus:
"Red enameled watch, about the size
of a half dollar, marked in case 'Flor
ence L.. Stokes, July 1st.' "
Ambrose Clark, the son of Mrs. Hen
ry Codman Potter, married Florence
K Stokes. At the time of the Coopers
town robbery it was reported that
some of young Mrs. Clark's jewels had
been taken..

OAKLAND, Aug. 16.â Oakland divi
sion of the California Anti-Compulsory
Vaccination League will meet Friday
evening at Kohler & Chase Hall, 1013
Broadway. The league purposes to en-
Join the Board of Education from en
forcing the statute requiring vaccina
tion of public school children.
Principals and teachers will make
known the board's action to the pupils
to-morrow 'morning when they assem
ble at school.
Dr. W. E. A. Knowles' motion super
seding that of Director W. K. Weir's
to exclude the children on Monday in
stead of to-morrow was carried. The
vote was: Ayes â Directors Knowles.
Weir, Sutherland, Donahue, Wickson.
Noâ D. W. W. Allen. Absentâ William
Schmidt.
The Board of Education to-night or
dered that all children In the public
schools must be vaccinated. Superin
tendent S. D. Waterman was directed
to enforce the law, Monday, August
22, belngr the last day on which un
vaccinated pupils may attend.
This order, according to figures sub
mitted at to-night's meeting of the
board, affects 885 children who are not
vaccinated and 132 pupils who are at
tending school on certificates that they
are not in physical condition to stand
the operation. Superintendent Water
man said returns showed that there
were 2S07 pupils who had been success
fully vaccinated.
Concerning those children who have
been certified as not in physical con
dition, a careful investigation will be
made of their cases. The board will
not exclude any child who is actually
unable to pass the operation.
Dr. . N. K. Foster, secretary of the
State Board of Health, appeared and
made the following statement:
It Is the duty of this board, though an un
pleasant one. to enforce the law as it etands
on the statute books. There Is no recourse.
There Is in Berkeley a larger percentage of
ur.vacclnated public school children than in
any other district In California. If there are
13'J children in Berkeley so unhealthy that they
cannot be vaccinated I shall have to chanfte
my opinion concerning the college town's
status from a hygienic point of view. If a
child Is really unhealthy he will not be ex
cluded from the schools, but I trust that no
physician will so far forget himself as to
lFtue a certificate in a case that does not
fairly demand It. '
There Is but. one thing to be done and
that is to exclude unvacclnated children. It
makes no difference whether they have been
admitted to school this term. â¢

It would be well for Intending visit
ors from the Golden State to know Just
what California has on exhibition here
and to write -to- the Exploitation Bu
reau /or a map of the grounds, so they
will know how to find the various
eights they wish to view; or they can
secure a map upon reaching the fair.
This Is a list of the various California
exhibits:
California building, on the crest of a knoll,
rising from the west end of/ the machinery
bulldln*. The California building contains no
exhibit, but visitors may rerfster and rÂ«st
here, read toe Ban Francisco papers and writ*
Utters. A breezt usually awer pi the knoll
There are trolley rides to beautiful
suburban parks to be had, one of them
giving a view of the pretty Meramec
River, which flows from the Ozark
Mountains into the Mississippi, a short
distance below St. Louis. There are
dozens of German gardens, where beer
and schmlerkaese may be partaken of
under the trees, but St. Louis doesn't
point to these as her proudest posses
sions. The immense city water works,
Including the clarifying plant (the wa
ter is taken from the Mississippi below
the Junction of the turgid Missouri), Is
another sight worth beholding. To
reach it one must get a permit at the
City Hall to ride over the municipal
electric road that runs to It from the
city's edge.
INTERESTING SIGHTS.
means would much better find a room
in a private home than go to any of
the cheaper hotels, for the latter are
rarely very comfortable and their rates
for rooms are usually higher.
Commissioner Wiggins has been in
formed that last week when the
monthly three-day sale excursion
tickets Trom Los Angeles to the fair
Â¦was on, 1500 tickets to St, Louis were
sold. The buyers of these will proba
bly start on at once. Southern Califor
nia will send a great throng to the fair
and the tide from the northern section,
including San Francisco, will be much
greater in proportion to the far greater
population. Altogether California will
tend many thousands to the exposition.
Most of those who will come from the
Golden State have never been to St.
Louis â have not even passed through
the Missouri metropolis on their way
to Chicago and New York, as it is oft!
the main line to ocean travel, and the
ruiing city of a territory all its own.
There are many interesting things
about St. Louis, though it Is not rated
as a show place. It has plenty of good
theaterr. with first-class attractions
during the season, and some of the
finest churches In the country and plen
ty of them. Californians should dili
gently read Winston Churchill's "The
Crisis" before coming here, as many of
the historic landmarks of St. Louis are
mentioned In it and the people one
meets are likelv to ask the first thing,
"Have you read 'The Crisis'?" They
will point out the various features men
tioned in the book, for these are fa
miliar to SL Louisans.
HISTORICAL PLACES.
*Here and there are landmarks flavor
ed with the romance of those days
more than a century ago when the
trading station of St. Louis was the
outpost of civilization. There are the
silent "Father of Waters," sepulcher of
its discoverer, the Kads bridge span
ning it and the great breweries â one
the largest in the world. In the white
bluffs of the majestic Mississippi, the
caves and other objects prominent in
Mark Twain literature are to be seen.
There are daily steamer excursions, 25
cents the round trip, that give one a
good view of the scenery along the big
stream and a sight of the angry Mis
souri as it hurls Its boiling yellow
waters into the quiet parent river. The
biggest brewcrj' in the world, in South
St. Louis, on the Mississippi bank, is
open all day to visitors, and guides
are always on hand to take parties
through free of charge, as at the San
Francisco mint.

â¢Vpoms they fall into unless they are

There is a city full of vacant rooms

Chicago Knights Templar En Route
Here on Splendid Special.
CHICAGO. Aug. 16.â The movement
to the Tiennial Conclave of the
Knights Templar of the United States
at San Francisco commenced to-day
by the departure from Chicago of one
of the handsomest trains that has ever
crossed the continent. The train,
composed of the most modern Pull
man sleepers, including compartment,
dining and observation cars, was made
up in the Chicago and Northwestern
station and is designated "the Grand
Eucampmcnt Special."
It carries Grand Master Sir Henry
Bates Stoddard and his official staff
and members of their families, the
I party consisting of 143 persons. The
I trip to San Francisco is to be made via
St Paul and includes a stop of six
I days in the Yellowstone National
i Park: thence to Seattle, Tacoma and
' Portland, and over the Shasta route
I to Monterey, Santa Cruz and othei
i points, the party arriving in San Fran
i Cisco on August 29. :. v v
j The return will be through South
' ern California, visiting the Grand

sent here from California, though a
herd of dairy cows, some Angora goats
and some merino sheep have been
promised.
California visitors who may wish to
go directly to tha fair grounds from
the Union station may take the Wa

cludes the most prominent residents of
the Quaker City.
Many commanderies are scheduled
to arrive in San Francisco on Monday
evening, September 5, and Tuesday
morning, September 6, the day of the
parade. The transportation commit
tee is apprehensive that some of those
commanderies will reach San Fran
cisco too late to be in the parade. It
will be difficult for the railroad com
panies to handle such an unusually
large amount of traffic, the largest in
tho history of California, and many of
the special trains will be late in arriv
ing. The transportation committee
suggests that commanderies change
their day of departure and make It
one or two days earlier, omit some
stop-over en route, l-ather than miss
the parade, which is expected to be
the greatest demonstration ever seen
in San Francisco.

committee, of which R. B. Moore is
chairman, is most active in preparing
entertainment for the visitors, so as
to keep them occupied and fully enter
tained from the time they arrive in
San Francisco until they depart. The
entertainment is to be quite out of
the ordinary, as the committee is anx
ious to show the visitors ths features
peculiar to the Pacific Coast.
The best troop of Chinese perform
ers, brought especially for the occa
sion from China, will give perform

their families; concerts in the public

the natives of China,. Japan, Sandwich
Islands and the South Sea Islands, will
be features.
Visitors Will Be Entertained During
Their Entire Stay Here.
FEATURES OF THE CONCLAVE.
He had been informed, however,
that the companies are now in a po
sition to supply the current, but so
far as the local order is concerned it
is too late. The money originally set
aside for this purpose has been ex
pended in other â¢ channels, > so if- the
square is to be illuminated as intend
ed the funds must come from other
quarters. This question will be taken
up at the meeting of the general com
mittee to-day.
At the suggestion of F. "W. -Dohr
mann, Messrs. Currier, Dohrmann,
Jennings, Sbarboro and Truman were
appointed a committee of five to con
fer with the entertainment committee
of the local Knights that the citizens'
committee may obtain information as
to just where it can be of most ser
vice. It is the general, opinion that
tha committee will decide to increase
the number of excursions so as to take
in the fruit and wine districts of the
State and" even go as far as the mining
counties of the Sierra Nevada, the
mining industry being of special in
terest to the Easterners.
After deciding to request all of the
citizens of the city to decorate their
homes in â honor of the conclave the
committee adjourned to report its
views of the situation to the general
committee this afternoon.
CURRENT NOW AVAILABLE.
T. H. Goodman informed the com
mitte that a series of excursions had
been arranged, but perhaps there was
room for suggestion for more and big
ger ones than had been provided for.
One point, however, he wished to call
to the attention of the committee was
that the original plan of the Knights
to illuminate Union Square had been
abandoned and he suggested that this
be taken up at once by the committee.
Pierce informed the committee that
the reason for the abandonment of
this plan was not for lack of money at
the time the plan was conceived, but
because the light companies had stat
ed that they were unable to supply the
current.
Grand Commander Pierce arrived at
this point and' upon request of the
Mayor outlined the plans of the local
'Knights for the reception and enter
tainment of the visitors. He said that
rooms for all the visitors had been ob
tained and headquarters would be es
tablished and bureaus of information
provided that would insure lack of
confusion so far as the reception and
assignment to Quarters Â¦was concerned,
but what his order especially desired
was that the committee take ur> the
question of boomine California.
The executive committee of the
prominent citizens' committee organ
ized to assist in the entertainment of
the visiting Knights Templar during
conclave week held an important
meeting in the office of Mayor Sohmitz
yesterday afternoon. Though no def
inite plan was agreed upon, this be
ing lett for the decision of the general
committee., which meets this after
noon in Maple Hall, Palace Hotel, at
3 o'clock, the way was cleared for in
telligent work, the lull scope if t'ia
plans of the local lodges of the order
being laid before the meeting.

The main influx of Callfornians into the

in October, with a steady stream of

H. Chandler Egan of Exmoor took goM
medal honors to-day in the qualifying
round of the sixth annual "Western GolC
Association championship, easily lead
ing the field of eighty-one starters from
all over the "West, with a total score of
144 for thirty-six holes. In the mom
ing Egan set a new record for the
course, totaling 70. This displaced the
amateur record of 72. held by himself,
and the professional record of 72, made
by Robert Simpson of Riverside. Twen
ty strokes under "bogey" for the long
route composed the day's work of Egaa
as the best golf seen in the West. Per
fect golfing conditions prevailed.
Playing with Egan was his college
mate, Fay Ingalls. Harvard's cham
pion, who made a total score of 133.
This gave him a prominent qualifying
place.
In contrast to the sensational work
of Chandler Egan was the golf of
Champion "Walter E. Egan. After tak
ing 80 for the first round, the cousin of
Chandler required 86 for the afternoon
round, a total of 166, which gave him
little margin for a place in the qualify
ing division. The principal scores:

in the first event to-day with Stanley

by defeating the much-touted Snyder
McGregor and relegating him to fourth
position. Snow drove the favorite, but
a bad break cost him his chances in the

well and took the place from Lela
luckily. In the pools Stanley Dillon
sold at $10 in pools of $100. The books
Quoted 5 to 1 about him. Snyder Mc-
Gregor was at even money. After the

Special Dispatch to The Call,
Famous Driver Has No Dif
ficulty in Landing the Son
of Sidney Dillon First
' -The presence of Kid McCoy at Camp
Â° has infused a quantity of gin
ger into the big miner from Butte. Just
Â° now he looks aund works faster than he
Aver did in his life before. An air of
confidence has spread over the training
. Quarters and the followers of Munroe
are commencing to claim he will bring
t ,home the money on the night of the
lnst.
"A sort of boxing carnival took place
yesterday- at Sheehan'8. Four mitt ar
' ti^ts of various sizes and weights stood
Â° up bfcfore the miner and gave and took
c wallops of various kinds. Jack went
through the ordeal without turning a
hair. He was always willing and al
ways ready to mix it or go clever when
ever the occasion demanded.
lie arose earlv in the morning and
lock that customary spin. When time
lor entering the gym came around in
the afternoon the crowd outside could
not be accommodated. The gym was
packed as the miner stepped down
from his dressing room and proceeded
to wallop the various punching bags
for four rounds.
The first to don the big mitts with
Jack was Kid McCoy. He started in
light av.ay to make it interesting and
this race was sustained till the three
â¢rounds had bten reeled off. McCoy
Vas clever, aggressive and defensive all
ct once, and Munroe was compelled to
i'o the limit with the agile Kid.
McCoy would dance around and then
shoot a fast one at the miner's head,
inakins a getaway in quick order. In
. the clinches he played foxy and would
' cramp himself up in such curious posi
tions that the miner was forced to do
some tall figuring as to how he would
reach his man. But he landed now
e cÂ°and then and sometimes made the Kid
* Iwinee..
The pace was hot while it lasted and
* brought forth rounds of applause from
those present. After each round the
Kid would take the miner to one side
?nd tell him a few things about how to
Â«ct iti the clinches, such as pushing his
man away aad then sending home the
wallop. He watched Jack closely and
when he made any suggestions the
miner always did his best to carry
them out.
After the Kid had finished Twin Sul
livan came uv to get his. The Twin
*ae wont to bore in and make it rather
rough at times. He received a few stiff
ones in the mixups, but always came
back. Jack made an excellent showing
with Sullivan, doing some aggressive
work in the clinches.
Next came Andy Gallagher for two
round.". This bout was a real warm
Â° one. with both men letting go some stiff
hooks and jabbing fiercely at times.
TVndy. gave an exhibition of clever
footwork and made the miner travel
some to keep up the pace. When time
wars called the big fellow had Andy
apainst the ropes and the pair were
rrivlng and taking some Jolty slaps
with both hands.
. Harry Chester finished the day's
work by going: one round with Munroe.
Tim McGrath says the miner will sure
ly win. He is gTeatlv pleased to have
McCoy on the grounds. McCoy seems
highly pleased with Munroe's showing
and expresses the opinion that he will
beat Jeffries.

habits of quitting. badly at a critical

neld which opposed him in this race.
He did show speed enough to carry
him to the front by two and a half
lengths, but Monastic II hung so close
to him the. "gray- streak" began to
back up going four furlongs*
Turning for home he also swung wide,
allowing White Plume to skim along
the rail, saving several lengths and
gaining enough advantage to win by
a good length and a half.
Don Domo was backed from even
money down to 13 to 20, and was looked
upon as about the best investment of
the day. His defeat was a bitter blow
to the talent-
There was much dissatisfaction ex
pressed over the decision of the Judges
in placing The Lady first in the fifth
race. It was claimed by 7 many that
Princess Tulane plainly won, \ with
Ahola second and The Lady third.
However, the judges were in the best
position to determine the- positions at
the finish. The track was fast and the
weather clear, but the attendance was
only fair. Summary:

day from a two weeks' vacation spent ln South
ern Caliromla. I %Vhlle lighting a cigar in the
face of a Los AnseJes breexe Daley bad the
misfortune to set fire to the starboard win* of
his mustache. The conflagration wu extin
guished before the flames burned the skin, but
one-half of the upperllp drapery was ruined.

The names of two vessels were added yes
terday to the overdue llÂ»t and the rate of

at 6 oer cent. The British ship Hampton onÂ«
of them, is out 154 days from Antwerp for

DowÂ»r is alao a man of action. He seized
both hat *nd cap aa evidence and took Larson
to the Harbor police station, where he charged
his prisoner with burglary.
"Ah tank ay ban yobbed," was Larson's
only comment.
Gallagher is a man of action, however. He
saw Larson first, and finding Policeman
Dower laid the facts before the law's repre
sentative.
Otto Larson, a deckhand on a river steamer,
was arrested yesterday by Policeman Dower
and charted with burglary. Neither Dower
nor Larson la Terr clear aÂ« to the circum
stances of the allered felonious fracture of
the law, nor is D. Gallagher, the complaining
witness, able to throw much light on the af
ih'.r. Larson and Gallagher skpt on Monday
night beneath the roof of the same Clay-street
roomlng-bonse. When Gallagher arose yester
day morning his derby hat had disappeared
and in Its place was hanging a cloth cap.
Gallagher wore the cap to work. About noon
he met Larson on Jackson-street wharf. Gal
lagher's derby hat was on Larson's head.
'That's my hat; give it up." said Gallagher,
grabbing the stiff felt headpiece.
"You havÂ« my cao," replied Larson, taking
pocsesslon of h'.s property.
According to Larson, his early morning- ex
perience was almost identical with Galla
gher's, and he wore the Gallagher bat because
somebody had previously removed tho Larson
cap.

the rest of the voyage was peaceful
and without event.
Queenstown was reached January

paired and with a full crew, she re
sumed her voyage.
The British ship Routenburn, Cap

ytsterday from Newcastle, England,
! has ended a long and disastrous pas
sage. Storms beset the sailing vessel's
; path from the outset of the voyage
I and before the Routenburn's journey

ship's deck into ocean graves and four
members of the crew, three seamen
and the third officer, were In the sick
bay nursing injuries received from
flying epars.
The Routenburn herself was sadly
battered, by the sea. She was taken
into Queenstown, her deckhouses
wrecked, her sails blown to rags and
her rigging twisted into a snarl that
human effort could never untangle.
She was in distress with a vengeance.

cane, also from the southwest. The
Routenburn was thrown on her beam
ends. She was buried beneath roaring
torrents of wild-swept water one mo

til the wind whistled under her keel.
Seas boarded her and smashed in
deckhouses as if they had been built
of paper instead of good, tough teak.
Lifeboats were converted into kind

overboard. Sails were blown to rags,
steel rigging was torn adrift and every

another apprentice, a first voyager

When the hurricane had blown it

boy who occupied the managerial chair with

BRITISH SHIP^ROUTENBURN WHICH ARRIVED YESTERDAY FROM ENGLAND AFTER A LONG AND DISASTROUS VOT-
T l^^I^P%Ii%^l^Y E ?^^^S^ Z SS^^ > DOWNED. FOUR OTHERS WERE IN-
When the case was called on August
S a request for a continuance was made
by the defense on the ground that At
torney Frank McGowa/i was absent
from the city. It .was granted till yes
terday. As soon as the case was called
yesterday Attorney McGowan asked
for a continuance, as Attorney George
A. Knight was absent from the city
and desired to be present when the de
cision was rendered. District Attorney
Byington objected. He said it was not
necessary for either of the counsel to
be present.
The Judge said he had noticed that
after the previous continuance some ad
verse comment* had been made by the
District Attorney's office, as recorded
in one of the daily papers. In addition
some overzealous citizens, who were too
cowardly to give their names, had been
writing to the newspapers and to him
self on the same subject. He was ready
to decide the case, but he saw no cause
for urgency. No authorities had been
submitted to him except those fur
nished by. the defense. He had to look
up numerous authorities himself and
had to read all the testimony carefully,
which occupied considerable time. It
seemed to him a question whether he
as Judge or some one else should de
cide when it should be the proper time
to render the decision.
' f I shall," continued the Judge, "de
cide all cases when I am ready to do so,
notwithstanding the comments of men
who are too cowardly to sign their
names, or any one else. I am running
this court, and will do so as long as I
am on the bench."
Byington said he had supplied au
thorities on two questions, and the
Judge" replied: "Only on one question.
There was no brief, and I had to find a
great many authorities myself on all
the points involved."
"I don't think," said Byington, "that
people's making comments should in
fluence the court in giving judgment."
"They will not Influence me," replied
the Judge. "I will decide the case when
I am ready. I want the opinion to be
of record. I want it to be in such shape
as to form part of the transcript, bo
that the Justices of the Supreme Court
can see my reasons. I have a rough
draft of my opinion ready, but it has
not yet been engrossed. For that rea
son and for my own convenience I shall
continue the matter till Monday, Aug
ust 22." .
Judge Dunne's decision on the mo
tion to dismiss the Information charg
ing Mrs. Botkin with the murder of
Mrs. Ida Henrietta Deane was also con
tinued yesterday till the same date.
Judge Cook yesterday rebuked .the
District Attorney and various anonym
ous writers who have been criticizing
him for delaying his decision on the
motion for a new trial in the case of
Mrs. Cordelia Botkin, convicted for the
second time of the murder of Mrs. Eliz
abeth Dunning by sending her a box
of poisoned candy to Dover, Del., in
August, 1893.
â¢On June 15 of last year he again de
â¢ manded the property, but ehe refused
tp give it up and claimed to be the
o owner. On this account Peterson al
; leges that c.t the time his wife made
the f romise she did so fraudulently and
viikh the purpose to cheat him. He says
â¢ that she has realized great profits, ag
gregating $20,000, and ?old two of his
boats -for $1700. He believes that she
the S2250 he gave her and
enough more to bring the total in bank
up to 515.000. Mrs. Peterson is charged
' v.fth threatening to dispose of the prop
erty, and he ask? that she be restrained
and that she render an accounting.
'.He returned from the trip in Septem
ber, of the 6ame year, and in April,
1902, demanded the reconveyance, but
?:he persuaded him to let her retain the
Â¦title.
"Peterson yesterday filed a suit in the
Superior" Court against his wife, de
manding the reconveyance and an ac
counting of about 120,000 in rrcfits she
i8.*aid to have received from the Peter
son bcating-hcuse.
In Ms complaint Peterson alleges that
en February 15, 1S01. he gave his wife
"a. bill of sale for the boathouse, five
gasdline launches, a Whitehall boat and
the barge Vera. Besides he gave her
J22S0 IA cash, and hied himself off to
England. Ke said that the understand
ing was that upon his return she should
reconvey the property to him. and as
they had. been living In harmony he
reposed great confidence in her.
_*Whea Henry J. Peterson, proprietor
of the boat house at the Folsoaa street
wharf, decided in the spring: of 1901
to- take a vacation trip to Eng
land he thoughtfully provided against
his failure to return by transferring
bis property and boat renting bus
iness to his wife, on the ground
trtat it would save the trouble of
administering: his estate. After a few
months abroad he returned to his work
and "lived happily with Mrs. Peterson,
but his suggestions that she reconvey
the property to him were met with the
plea that it would be for the best in
â¢terest of the business to permit the title
to_ remain in her name. Of late he has
been demanding a return of the hold
-tRgs, but ehe new claims to be sole
owner. '

hero's original timorousness developed
Into bravery, is too well known at

that his friends here see little of him.
However, since his recent return from

How an. Author Works.
Not only here, but everywhere in the country, public
opinion will support the administration in any measures
it may deem necessary to speedily terminate this condi
tion. If Russia insist, in the face of proper diplomatic
representation, the proper course will be to send a
naval convoy with a laden fleet of our Pacific liners to
protect them against all comers. If Russia have any
warships left in a seaworthy condition to attempt the
seizure of our merchantmen the provocation will be
hers, and she will have to take the consequences, no
matter how unpleasant they may be.
OUR merchants have awakened to the fact that,
under the Russian declaration of contraband, our
entire trade in Eastern Asia is slipping away from
us. If flour, meat, and cotton, not consigned to the mili
tary depots of a belligerent, are to be put on the contra
band list, our trade disappears. If Great Britain firmly
continue her refusal to recognize the right of a belliger
ent to rewrite international law, the British ports on this
coast will take the trade. Russia may have as an ulte
rior motive the aiding of her ally, France. It is worth
noticing that neither in the Red Sea nor elsewliere has
a French ship been halted on seized. English ships have
been searched off the coast of Portugal, and American
cargoes have been destroyed in the Pacific, but French
commerce has not been disturbed.
We are interested in the export of flour, in,eat, cotton
and horses, all of which we have in surplus, and none of
which is contraband by international law. This coast
is interested in them all. It was supposed during the
Boer war that we were violating neutrality by selling
horses and mules to Great Britain, and the administra
tion was hotly criticired. But Solicitor Penfield of the
State Department published the history and the rulings
of our Government back to the time of Jefferson, prov- v
ing that we had always treated those animals as non
contraband, and then the clamor ceased.
A country must protect its commerce, and not permit
its destruction because two distant nations, having some
sea power, and being at war, assume to say what is !
contraband and subject* to seizure. Japan has done us a
friendly service by riddling the two Russian fleets of
Port Arthur and Vladivostok. Togo and Kamamura
were putting the trade of the world under obligations
by putting the Russian war ships out of commission.
Those ships had shown far greater capacity for harrying
trade and sinking defenseless merchant ships than for
fighting an armed enemy.
Cargoes for Asia are held on our docks and in our
warehouses that should be at sea on their way to the
Asiatic market. Already one of our fine liners, the Korea,
has run the gauntlet, thanks to the courage and seaman
ship of Captain Seabury, but the risk of losing such
costly carriers as the Korea. Siberia and Mongolia is
too great, and they are idle, as far as the purposes of
commerce are concerned.
The merchants of San Francisco have taken steps to
let our Government know the needs of our commerce.
Of course, before acting, the Government has to look
into the future. It must consider the effect of a deci
sion made now upon our interests in the event of our be
ing involved in a foreign war. But this is to be consid
ered, that, as far as the future is concerned, no nation in
F.urope can long subsist without resorting to our sup
ply of food and fabrics. We have not only that safe
guard against war, for our prestige on sea and land dis
inclines any nation to attack us. It is likely that in the
I future there will be no more imminent cause of war
than that which may arise against Russia because of her
insufferable assumption of the right to dictate to us in
the matter of contraband.
So, though the question is serious in all its aspects,
we have reason to believe that our Government will con
sider its most serious phase to be the immediate protec
tion of our commerce. If proper representations are
j made to the State Department, it will be made plain
that a trade carefully built up for years may be destroyed
j in a month, to be recovered with great difficulty. Every
! American ship that floats on the Pacific, except in the
) coast lines, is there because of the trade furnished by
I Eastern Asia. Under the definition of contra
| band there can be no neutral cargo, and under her in
{ flated idea of the war zone, our commerce is excluded
! from Chinese ports as well as from those of Japan, and
j our commerce has come to a dead halt.
The great need of the Western i
farmer la more moisture. Happily in ]
that agricultural section the rainfall ;
is bu dlntributed that most of the an- :
mi."! precipitation is during the season j
when most needed, the time of matur- 1
ing the growing crops. What the
great West does In the way of cereal I
and other production is well known. )
What It might do under mort favora
ble moisture condition!) it is difficult
to imagine. But the fanners have in
their own hands the possibilities of
vastly improving conditions. They
may not be able to increase the
uinount of rainfall, but they can pro
tect and conserve it far better and
make It much more useful than at
present. They can do this by shield
ing It from its enemies, wind and sun
light.
The Bureau of Forestry has been
working: on this problem In an entire
ly practical way. Its agents have been
and still are scattered through the 1
Western States, studying the existing 1
tree growth and the conditions of to- I
pography, soil and climate. All this
is for the purpose of determining if
trees can be generally grown, where
they can be best grown, what are the
most suitable species of trees, how
Â¦ most successfully to plant and culti- |
vate them and what Â£ Tesults may be j
expected. The conclusions drawn
from studies In Western Kansas,
small part of Northern Oklahoma, a
considerable strip J&f Eastern Colorado
and a portion of Southwestern Nebras
ka have been embodied in a bulletin
entitled "Forest Planting in Western
Kansas," which will shortly be issued
and can be had upon application to tho
Forester, United State* Department of
Agriculture.
In Western Kansas the topography
is huih that little or no aid can be se
cured from irrigation. The reliance of
the people must be in conserving their
water supply by fighting off as as ef
fectually as possible the waste inci
dent to evaporation. The seriousness
of this waste iÂ»- apparent in the fact
that the annual evaporation from a
water surface is about 54 Inches.
very high rate is due to the excessive
ly dry atmosphere and the burning
winds that prevail throughout the
summer and, unimpeded by obstacles,
sweep with accelerating velocity over
a vast treeless area. The interposition
of trees will effect a radical change fcr
the better in the rate of evaporation.
If every farmer will plant a wind
break or shelterbelt, very much
of the force of the wind will be con
quered and the evaporation rate will
be materially cut down. Every farmer
who thus plants will insure local pro
tection for his own crops, and will
thus improve the yield of his fields.
The more general this planting the
more far reaching and Important will
be the change effected.
Added to the agricultural gain,
these shelter belta will furnish an
Inestimable advantage In providing
wood lota, from which may be se
cured fuel necessary for domestic and
steam power purposes, fence posts and
general farm repair material. It is
wasteful for the prairie farmers to be
buying coal when they can. at little
expense and while Improving their
general farm conditions, grow the fuel
they may require. And while the
price of lumber is constantly soaring
higher. It Is a wise thing for these
farmers, at a small cost, to raise their
own lumber, especially when by means
of these shelter belt wood lots they
are effecting at the same time an im
mense Improvement of their farm
lands. "â¢
The bulletin which the bureau will
shortly Issue discusses the existing
conditions, the need and advantages
of tree planting, the kinds of trees
best suited to the locality, and why
certain kinds should be chosen for
certain elevations and moisture con
dition*. It gives estimates of how
different kinds will thrive, â¢furnishes
planting plans for wood lots, shelter
belts and wind breaks, and describes
how planting, cultivation, pruning
and thinning can best be done. It is
a practical handbook, and should be
In the possession of every farmer In
the region covered by Its conclusions
and advice. The time may never
come when Western Kansas will have
the proper proportion of forest to ag
ricultural lands, but the time la now
at hand when the farmers of that
section,* by availing of the scientific
advice of the Bureau of Forestry, can
begin greatly to improve the value of
their lands, to increase the annual
output of their farms, and to provide
for. themselves comforts of shade pro
tection which they do not now enjoy.

fact that you are in possession of "a

DIVISION FENCESâ Loch Sloy.

of California la regard to division
fences: "Coterminous owners are mu

the .boundaries and monuments be

them, unless one of them chooses to
let his land He without fencing. In

THERE seems to be a feeling on the Sacramento,
above Knights Landing, that the committee that
has taken charge of the flood problem is informed
as to only one branch of it, and that concerns the lower
reaches of the river. Probably no citizen of California
and no engineer in the country has more knowledge of
the river and valley than General Green of Colusa. It
is his opinion that the study must cover the various
watersheds, from which four separate floods come, all
to be combined below the confluence of the American
River. One of these originates in the region north of
the confluence of the Feather, another in the drainage
that combines in' the Feather, and a third in
the wide watershed of the American. Fijom . the
west side a fourth flood comes through Cache
and Putah creeks, that is gathered from an ex
tensive watershed. The source of these floods, the
height from which they are precipitated, and their effect
when combined, seem to be important elements in the
problem. If the study be entirely confined to the lower'
reaches and to relief by spilling these combined floods
into the San Joaquin, it ; appears that the data will be
insufficient for an entire solution.
- The engineers will have the benefit of the experience
and conclusions of Eads. Williams and many men emi
nent in their profession, who in past years have made a
study of the situation, and doubtless their report will
quite fully cover the scientific p*art of the problem, leav
ing the practical matters, such as providing the money,
to others. When that branch of it comes into focus,
the fact that all the land to be reclaimed is in private
ownership will present a difficult question. If the land
will not stand the imposition of a tax sufficient to
pay the enormous cost of the work, a test will be made
of the policy of improving private property at public ex
pense. 'It. is not by antagonize any proposition -that we
suggest this, but only to. prepare the interested parties
for the work they must do to make out their case.

The assassination of Minister von
Plehwe. following so closely on the
heels of that of General Bobrlkoff. re
calls thcQaya of the great Terrorist
conspiracy which culminated In the
assassination of Alexander II. There
Is an evident relation between war and
revolution in Russia. Immediately
after the Napoleonic wars which had
a profound effect on the life of Rus
sia, involving as they did not only the
Invasion, the burning of the Kremlin
and Moscow, and the calamitous re
treat of the French army, but the re
turn tide, which carried the Cossacks
to the banks of the Seine, came a
revolutionary period in Russia, which
culminated In the December outbreak
so vividly indicated in Tolstoi's great
ncvel, "War and Peace." In the same
way the Crimean war was followed
almost without interval by a period of
moral and social revolution, the most
remarkable event of which was the
emancipation of the serfs in 1S61, two
years before Lincoln's famous procla
mation. But the freeing of the serfs
was only one among many reforms
Â¦which broke^up the old order and in
troduced the'new. The whole field of
education was similarly affected, the
doors of the schools and colleges being
thrown open to classes that had never
hitherto profited by them, and even
tually to the sons of the emancipated
serfs. The 1 education of women also
entered on a new and more liberal
phase than ever^before in the Russian
empire and the new woman made he
appearance in the land of the Czars.â.

In demolishing the palace at Belgrade,
where the murder of King Alexander
and Queen Draga took place, the work
men came acros a secret stairway built
In the walls and communicating with a
tunnel of great length leading, to a re
mote spot outside the city precincts.
Inquiries have developed that King
Milan had caused this secret staircase
and subway to be constructed years
ago to provide him with a means of es
cape In the event of a military revolt,
such as that which brought the reign
of his ill-fated son to so tragic a close,
but that just two months b'efore the as
sassination of Alexander the latter,
convinced that he had nothing to fear
and looking upon the tunnel as afford
ing opportunities to thieves and burg
lars to rob the palace unpercelved,
caused the opening in the wall to the.
secret staircase and also the entrance
to the tunnel in the basement to be
bricked up. This was done so quietly
that not one of those members of the
royal household who took part in the
massacre of the King and Queen were
aware of the existence of the subway.
By having it bricked up the unfortu
nate Alexander shut off what would
otherwise have proved a road to safety,
since If he could have secured access
to the tunnel he would, with Queen
Draga. have been able to reach the riv
er's edge and probably transportation
across the stream to the Hungarian
bank, on the other side thereof, before
the assailants had realized the direction
In which he had flown. No trace will

-No Calif ornian can see this impressive forest without
raised pride in the natural capacities of his State, nor
without swearing allegiance to the policy of developing
this great forest and preserving it for all time.
THE excursion to the State Redwood Park in the
Big Basin, successfully carried out by the State
Board of Trade, is the first move toward bringing
that interesting region before,. the public. The tract
owned by the State has in it about 4100 acres, mostly
primeval forest of a majestic character. It is a
genuine forest in which the redwood predominates, but
the tan bark oak, Douglass spruce, wax myrtle, madrone
and live oak also abound, giving a great and interesting
variety to the place. The redwoods are very large, ex
celled in height and diameter of their columns.. only by
their near relatives, the big tree's of the Sierras. They
are the striking features of the park, while the other
trees, with their variety of foliage, gentle the scene and
give it an indescribable grace. It. was the judgment of
the excursionists that the State had driven a good bar
gain in the purchase, and that San Francisco has a very
vital interest in that forest.
If the proposition to recede the Yosemite Valley pre
vail, the money now appropriated to it by the State may.
well be diverted to enlarging this State Redwood Park.
It is now accessible over an excellent stage road, but is
deficient in radiating roads and trails to its whole area.
When it may be reache* more easily and quickly it is
bound to become known as the greatest forest park in
the world. As a scenic asset of the State it is invaluable,
and the State Board of Trade has the credit of making
the first effort to bring it into notice. In a little while
it will be a standard trip from this city and our other
centers of population. Thousands of tourists will come
to see it. and the story of its wonders and beauties will
be spread abroad.
It is watered by clear and beautiful streams, abounding
in trout, and is plentifully supplied with deer, mountain
lions and other wild animals and birds. The predatory
carnivora will ultimately be exterminated, but the deer,
probably re-enforced by a herd, of elk, will always be
an interesting part of its sights. The park is capable of
enlargement to twice its r resent area and this should be^
provided for by the next Legislature.

crease among Southern negroes was 93.4 per cent, that
of Southern whites 134.9 per cent. It has been in the
cities alone that the respective rates of birth of negroes
and white men have approximated uniformity.
The economic conditions of ante-bellum days have
left a permanent stamp upon the nature of the pursuits
followed by the black of to-day. Agriculture is still the
mainstay of the negro wage-earner. More than three
fourths of them live outside of cities, while the white
residents are about equally divided between plantation
and town. Strangely enough, the census reports that
45.2 per cent of the whole negro population come under
the title of bread-winners and that of the entire 'white
population 37.3 per cent only merit this denomination.
When we read in further proof of the thriftiness of
the blacks that one-fourth of their women who are
wives and' two- thirds of the widows report themselves
as being engaged in gainful occupations, we -are prone
to look askance at alarmist theories concerning- the
threatened subversion of present day economic condi
tions in the South through negro non-productiveness.
With Hampton Institute and Tuskegee yearly adding
the leaven of skilled labor to this latent power of pro
duction the Southern States need have no great fears of
economic decay in the near future.

IN a recently published extract from the last census
of the United States. Commissioner North of the
Census" Bureau has transmitted to the Department of
Commerce and Labor a compendium of facts upon "Ne
groes in the United States." This volume, comprising
some three hundred pages of tables, statistics and com
ment, contains practically all that there is knowable
about the present condition of the black race in this
country â its numbers, educational status and economic
condition. Many are the theories concerning the ne
groes that will be upset by the facts herein set forth.
The negro population is not a migratory one. The
census returns show that of the nine and one-fifth mill
ion residing within the confines of continental United
States, Alaska. Hawaii and Porto Rico nearly nine
tenths are still below Mason and Dixon's line. Along
the lower Mississippi alluvial region, where the colored
population has always been the most dense,, the prepon
derance of the black over the white remains practically
unchanged. Issaquena County, Mississippi, with its pro
portion of fifteen negroes to one white person, is the
blackest spot on the topography of the South. The cen
ter of the negro population of the United States has
moved but 476 miles since 1790â from Dinwiddle County,
Virginia, to its present point, De Kalb County, North
western Alabama.
From a purely economic standpoint the ratio of in
crease between the negro and the white population in
the South probably has greater significance than any
other fact of the census returns. Despite the prevalent
impression that the negroes are rapidly displacing the
whites in the "black belt," through a more prolific rate
of birth, the tables in this compendium of census statis
tics indicate that since 1840 the rate of increase among
the negroes has steadily declined until in the period* of
forty years preceding the last census taking, the ia-

Colonel O'Neil of the First Regiment,
X. G. C, has come in for a large share
of praise, not only from the men of his
own regiment, the men under hia com
mand to-day, but also from some of
the leading Federal officers and the
umpires. On all sides he has been the
recipient of much comment of the most
favorable order for his executive abil
ity as an officer in matters military.
The boys of the N. G. C. never looked
better or appeared to better advantage,
as, with heads erect, shoulders back
and faces aglow with anticipation for
a smell of what they might expect
when they should be called upon to
protect the honor and the Interests of
our Golden State, they marched out
from the camp to the scene of the bat
tle maneuvers.
The soldiers have been praised by the
umpires for the manner in which they
strove to carry out the ideas of the
problems. They have worked hard,
long and well and although the morn
ing .was warm and the country they
traversed of an undulating and in many
places a rough nature, they bore the
strain well and on the whole came out
in good shape. Of course many of them
were soft and not hardened to such
strenuous work, but they buckled down
to duty when the call was made on
them.

ed and that happened to Private J.
Horsley of Company F. Twenty-eighth
Infantry, who sprained his ankle.
At one point where an engagement
took place between the cavalry blues
and the Fifteenth Infantry (browns);
both forces claimed victory, but the
umpires gave the decision to the blues,
who burst forth with great shouting
and cheering when they learned that
they had come out victorious.
The cavalry was in a ravine, un
mounted and at rest, when they re
ceived word that the browns were ad
vancing, and at a minute's notice they
sprang to their saddles and dashed
away, retiring to a safe position. Just
at the close of the fray some of the
contending forces got so close to each
other on the Atascadero flat that It
looked as though they were going to
come to a hand-to-hand tussle, using
the butts of their .muskets in Russian-
Japanese fashion.
The third exercise. In which Colonel
O'Neil figured prominently, was located
near Garcia. The browns first sent out
a scout of cavalry, then a vanguard of
Infantry, followed up by Infantry, cav
alry and artillery. At the Henry ranch
one-half of the troops went forward to

To enable everyone to enjoy one of
these beautiful Music Boxes we have, or-
ganized the Regina Music Box Club. You
can join this club on payment of one dollar
and the Regina will be sent to your house
the same day.
Nothing equals the Regina as a family
entertainer, and no home possessing one
need ever have a dull minute.
The children can dance to it â the boys
can drill by it and the elders can enjoy their
favorite tunes.
Best of all you pay for it while you
enjoy it. Write or call for full details.
, Do it to-day.

"BEE" BRAND CEYLON TEA sells for 50c, 60c and 80c per pound.
Read what the importers and sellers of this high-grade tea have ttj say of it:
"In our judgment 'Bee' brand is the best quality Ceylon tea and the best value for the money.
We have imported it for ten years. Each importation (and they come four times a year) is
larger than the previous one. Ceylon Tea is picked by hand, but thereafter it is rolled and handled
\ entirely by machinery. This obviates the accumulation of perspiration by delicately scented
leaves. The far-seeing Englishman finds the commercial advantage of modern methods outweigh
its cost. (Signed), GOLDBERG, BOWEN & CO."

CHICAGO, Aug. 16.â ThÂ» ripe In wheat
Trices came with great waves of buying
throughout the, â¢ day, the accompaniments
of dispatches received. each increasingly
ralamiioun in suggestions nf ruin to the spring
wheat. According to the dispatches current,
the prospect of enough fcr bread and seed ap
peared to be a mere sickly glimmer. The mar
kets of the Northwest cut a wiie swath in
price-making. Minneapolis was not only sen-
Fatlnnally up, but the number of buying or
ders sent from there was lareer than for sev
tral weeks past. Crop news from some of the
experts who are now going over that country
is more discouraging than ever, and buying
OTtcr? that came in showed that many sections
will likely prove heavy losers. There was
more or \vsÂ» talk of damage in Manitoba from
rust, but from that section the. reports were
conflicting., A special from Winnipeg called
attention to the fact that wheat is being cut
there In many localities In be*=t condition, and
that the damage reports are unwarranted. The
popular movement in wheat was to buy May.
The market opened with sale* at $1 034 to
$1 03K for September, Â«old to $1 03Â«4 ,to $1 03
to $1 044 to $1 034 to $1 04*4 to SlKWi to
$1 C'<\*. and closed 24@2%c higher at $1 00@
1 0.14.
The reason for yesterday's strength in corn
was washed out by rnlns that had fallen
meantime in the places which It was said
the day before must have rain or suffer per
manent Injury to the crop. September corn
cloprd >ri@%c lower at 54 lie.
Oats were hleher at the opening, but closed
Irregular 4c lower to 'Â»c higher for Sep
tember a't 34UÂ©34Â«ic.
After a Ftrong opening In sympathy with
wheat, provisions weakened on heavy selling.
September pork eloped 174<" lower, lard 24c
up and ribs 124S15c tip. Buying for foreign
account on a fairly liberal scale held lard and
ribs eteady.

Wheat and Other Grains. j
WHEAT FREIGHTSâ Are largely nominal I
at ;r!4i2is 3d. usual European options, with !
'22s 6d asked by the shipowners' combine.
There is hardly enough spot business to base
a quotation upon. ' The chartered wheat fleet
in port has a registered tnrrsage of 11.500.
against 47.000 tons on the sameVlale last year;
disengaged. 90.970 ton3, aRainctVi'Xt.Or.O; on

WHEAT â The foreign mtrketjf were quiet,!
with buyers and sellers apart. <h :
Chicago adranccd from $1 OCfe to Â»l T5U. j
with the Southwest buying on-7Â» large scale. â¢
Bad reports ctntlnued from the Northwest,
Faying that where Wheat was. mryv-ted there j
would be nothing but chicken Â£?e* and that !
the hot weather of the past few days was j
ripening the grain so fast that it was all |
shrunken. Broomhall cabled that the Euro- j
pean crop was about the same as before, the
quality of the crop being indicated as pood.
The Chicago wires of R. Brent Mitchell said :
"Market wu active and the tone strong,
with the closing about top prlw*. The in- 1
centive was the Fame a* heretofore â unfavora- I
blc crop advices from the NorthweFt and ad- !
vancing Northwestern markets. There are re- j
ports of spreading damage from rust in the j
extreme north and In Manitoba, and there are 1
also many reports that are conflicting with \
this. The weekly Government report, while
confirming the damage, does not appear to be j
sensational. As heretofore, everybody admits
that it Is practically impossible to get at the j
percentage of loss until the threshing returns !
- are in. Receipt's of winter wheat continue )
large, and while the cash markets are firm, .
consumptive and distributive demand are not I
so greatly in evidence. Of course, the mills
are taking a little stuff all the time, but th*
buyinsr is of a hand-to-mouth character and j
the elevator people are still, we think. thÂ« !
principal buyers. New wheat Is beginning to j
arrive in the Northwestern markets. At the ,
end of another week the movement should be
quite free. We are of the opinion that in
the buying of wheat at this range and ad
| vance, conservatism should be exercised."
In this market futures were sharply higher
In sympathy with Chicago, and trading was
heavy and excited, some 15.000 tons selling
on the morninK session. Large shorts rushed
to cover and helped prices up on themselves.
Sellers of ca-Â«h grain were asking an advance,
but were not getting it. though the market
was firm.

CORN â The trade continue to quote a quiet
and featureless market at previous prices. 1
The Chicago wires of R. Brent Mitchell said j
yesterday: . "The feature of the situation was j
good rains In the Southwest and prospects of
showers over much of the corn belt. Thl3
cbocjtcd the flood of speculative Â¦ buying and
made considerable scattered liquidation so that !
Uie tomparatlve tone of the market was rather
heavy. The weekly Government Â¦ report while 1
notlnsr, that rain In needed in the Ohio Valley I
and in parts of the Southwest, is still reas- i
suring in tone as to the -general conditions.
The Illinois State report is of the same gen
eral character. It Is purely a weather mar
ket at the moment, and wo are not of those
who think the corn crop has yet been exten-
Elvely damaged."

Hay and Feedstuff s.
The Hay merchants reported- the market In
a desperate condition yesterday. The San
Francisco railroad yards were blocked with
loaded cars and the railroad officials begged
the Hay dealers to use all possible means to
clear their tracks. Every sidetrack is filled
with Hay, and a large number of cars are
held at Oakland waiting for room at San

are quoted at a decline. The upper grades

Receipts of Potatoes showed & marked fall

prices had a further decline, as stocks were
still excessive and all dealers were anxious
to 6*11. Dealers are hoping for some, im
provement in the export trade, as prices aie
low enough to admit of profitable shipping.
Sweet Potatoes arrived rather freely from va
rious sections and roM at lower rates. Onions
were steady, with trade moderately active.
The heavy accumulation cf poor quality
Green Corn, which had been lying around the
market for several days, was pretty well
cleaned ui> and frtshly arrived lots did better.
Strictly fancy Tomatoes were steady and the
best lots from across the bay were quoted
higher, but low grade offerings from the river
were still plentiful an- 1 , inclined to easiness.

No more Western Poultry was received, but
a. considerable portion of. what came in on the

prices of domestic stock down. Geese and

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
While there was no decline In Butter yes
terday, almost every dealer on the street re
! ported a weak, dragging market and said he
â¢ was shading the quotations fcr large Iot3 and
1 to posted buyers. Second creameries and dai
j rie* were very dull and dealers were offering
] them at concessions to work them off. It was
; reported that several creamery men from the
j San Joaquin were in town arranging to send
! the'.r Butter here, belns attracted by the re
i cent local aivance.
Cheese continues dull and plentiful.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The general tone of the fruit market was
one of easiness, with supplies of almost all
descriptions of tree varieties still far In excess
of the demand. The canners were still over
loaded with contract supplies of Pears and
Peaches and manifested but little Interest In
the open market. Clingstone Peaches were
quoted at $40#Krt per ton. the top rate Ivlnj
paid only for contracted lots. Freestones were,
nominal at 530^35 per ton for Crawfords and
$20 for Muirs. Bartlett Pears were weaker,
both for wrapped and bulk stock. The can
ners reduced their bids for the latter and
bought only when bargains were offered. Some
exceptionally fine offerings of wrapped Bart
lett Pears were received from Rogue River.
Oregon, and met with ready sale at $1 lO'Ql 25
per box. but for offerings from nearby sections
$1 per box was considered an extreme, figure.
Some canners were offering 57 per ton for
Plums in bulk, but r.o business was reported
i at that figure, although there was a heavy
j accumulation of all varieties lying around un
sold. Apples ruled, steady at the previously
quoted rates, and the best offerings of
! Peaches. Plums and Prunes In small pack
) ages were fairly active at good prices, while,
ordinary offerings dragged at unsteady rates.
Figs ruled weak under Increased supplies and
a light demand. Grapes were plentiful and
generally dull. The top quotation for crates
was obtained only for Tokay, the top for other
varieties being 75c". The market was still
glutted with Cantaloupes and Nutmeg Melons,
and. as usual, larsre lines had' to be held over.
There were no Longworth Strawberries re
ceived, but everything else In the Berry llnÂ«
was in good supply. Citrus and Tropical
fruits were dull and prices stood as previously
quoted â¢ â¢

. SUMMARY, OF THE MARKETS.
r.ess of Lnlted States Steel was clearly cue
to the anxiety over the market position for
finished st*el. which makes the maintenance
of association prices precarious. Holders of
trie Steel stocks were disposed to see special {
clanger to the market for steel products In I
the spread of labor troubles in the building
trades. Reports reached Wall street of plans ]
for further reduction of working forces by j
the Pennsylvania and Rock Island systems,
which pointed 10 further retrenchment In rail
road work In general. The development cf j
great 6trength in thÂ» corn market was the |
subject of some sober consideration, as great !
reliance is placed on a prosperous corn crop I
for the good things which the present stock '
market Is attempting to anticipate. The 1
weekly bulletin of the Weather Bureau
teemed to offer special grounds for the rise .
in the corn market. But the day's news
brought reports of rain in the corn belt and
predictions of more for to-morrow. The !
in the Rock Island Issues was alleged to be ;
due to the good corn prospects. The bulletin I
pointed out some deterioration In the cendi- !
ticn of cotton, but the rise in Louisville & !
Nashville was apparently an offset to this In- j
fluer.ee. â¢ â¢
Reports from many sources of spring wheat j
damage continued very numerous. Sugar's I
drop followed the report of a reduction in its '
rÂ«?fir.Â«-d product. Interior exchangee are turn- i
. ing gradually against New Ycrk, foreshadow- j
irg the crop moving demand for money. But j
; the New York money market is totally un- t
ruffled as yet. The market closed easy, after !
a futile attempt to rally it by marking up |
; Louisville & Nashville 24 points.
Bonds were irregular. There were sharp
1 reactions in the Central of Georgia Incomes.
Total tales, par value, $3,595,000.
United States 2s advanced '. 8 . the 3s reg
istered and the new 4s registered M and the
old 4s 4, while the new 4s coupon declined '

In oratorical tones and well rounded '
periods, whose sharp edges had been
worn away by the constant dripping
of Spring Valley water, Herman
Schussler, chief engineer for the com
pany, described yesterday, before Com
missioner Heacock, that portion of the
watershed within the City and County
of San Francisco.
Forty years ago, he said, Lobos
Creek, which wanders past the Marine
Hospital, furnished a daily supply of
2,000,000 gallons, which was a much
larger proportion for San Francisco
than it is now, when compared with
the total quantity of water consumed
at the present time. Since the old San
Francisco water works, the predeces
sor of the Spring Valley Company, di
verted the water from the creek by a
conduit, various changes of great im
portance have taken place in the wa
tershed. He said:
It sewerage systems in this city were con
structed as they ought to be â water tigntâ
absolutely Impervious to waterâ the water
shed would be of much more Importance, be
cause In a country subject to those cli
matic variations any constant and reliable
system of water like Lobus Creek has been
always Is and always will be an important
factor. Owlne to the fact that through gross
carelessnessâ partly on the part of the city
authorities, partly of Individual housebullders
with regard to their house sewers aad con
nectionsâthere has been a slight infiltration
of objectionable matter In Lobos Creek, but
not in sufficient quantity to make the water
objectionable for domestic use. But the prej
udice of people generally Is Â»Â»Â»Â«Â«Â« Â»Â»Â«*r
that has the. slightest suspicion of an Inflow
there was such a
nreinrtire existing we ceased to use the water.
>D u e t JU re[a!ned iV a S s a very valuable adjunct for
thÂ« iÂ«Â«Â» of rarks. plazas and for nre ex-
UnguVshlng purposes. The United States Gov
ernment owns one-half of this supply, which
is about 1.000.000 gallons per diem, or nearly
400.000.000 gallons per annum, which could be
utilized, and no doubt will be. by the com-
Pa The new park projected for the Richmond
district near Lake street will be benefited by
the presence of Lobes Creek. If the city
keeps on establishing more parks in the West
ern Addition it might pay eventually to lay
an independent pipe line from Loboa Creek
for the purpose of Irrigating those parks and
plazas.
Mr. Schussler gave the following as
the capacity of the four reservoirs used
for supplying this city and county:
Pilarcitos. 1,000.000,000 gallons per an
num; Crystal Springs, 20,235,000.000;
San Andreas, 5.566.000.000, and Lake
Merced, 2,659,000,000.
The proceedings will be continued
this morning.

Civil Service Commission Orders One
Dismissed and Another Re-
stored to Duty.
As. a result of the trials of Dairy
Inspectors E. C. Smith and E. B.
O'Connor upon charges filed by Health
Officer Ragan the Civil Service Com
mission yesterday ruled that the sus
pension of Smith by the Health Board
should be made permanent and that
he should be dismissed from his posi
tion. The commission finds that the
testimony sustains trie charges mAde
against Smith of dereliction of duty.
With respect to the charges against
O'Connor the commission finds that
there has been some laxity in the per
fcrmance of his duty, but that short
comings have not been established
against hin\ in such a degree as to
justify his removal ' from office. The
.commission believes that O'Connor has
been sufficiently punished by a suspen
sion of several months and orders him
restored to duty.

In San Rafael, was a passenger on thp
wrecked train. She said: "When the
crash came I rushed for the door of the
car I was In and attempted to alight,
but seeing the third rail. I ran through
the train to the rear platform. As I
alighted the switchman In the tower
ran toward me and exclaimed. "I'm
partly to blame for that. I ought to
have thrown the switch. Are there
many people hurt?" Miss Barrett kept
cool and calmed the fears of many
women among the passengers.
Mrs. Cerf, the Injured woman, would
not have been hurt had she not at
tempted to save her little boy. As she
stood up to grasp him the crash came,
and she was thrown violently against
a seat.
William Ritchie, the engineer of the
wrecked locomotive, could have saved
himself by jumping, but was afraid of
coming In contact with the third rail.
Late last night Ritchie was reported
as resting easily at the -sanatorium in
this city to which he was removed soon
after the collision. He seems to have
received no Injury except the fracture
of his leg.
Broker Sues Mrs. Walls.
Stephen Otis, the stock broker, who
secured judgment against John G.
Walls for $160760 on what the latter
termed a gambling debt, yesterday
began suit against Walls, his wifa,
Emma- G. Walls, and the Central
Grain and Stock Exchange to enforce
the collection of the Judgment. The
Sheriff could not find any of Walls'
property against which to levy, but it
was found that Mrs. Walls held 518
shares in the Central Grain and Stock
Exchange, which she claimed as her
separate property. It was testified be
fore a referee that the stock had been
given to Mrs. Walls as a "gift" by W.
E. Baines, president of the corpora
tion. Since receiving the shares In
1900 Mrs. Walls has been paid $41,
000 in dividends. Otis brought the
case before Judge Cook and was given
permission to sue Mrs. Walls.
Stablemen Renew the Boycott.
Notwithstanding the recent decision
of Judge Hunt declaring boycotts to
be illegal, the Stablemen's Union re
newed its fight yesterday by placing
pickets In front of the St. Lawrence
stables on Post street. It Is not known
what action the 'Stable and Carriage
Owners' Association will take .in the
matter, as yesterday was the first day
that pickets were placed in front of
boycotted stables since the decision of
Judge Hunt,
ANOTHER CAUSE ASSIGNED.
Miss M. Barrett, a resident of Sac
ramento, who Is spending a few days
Mrs. Serf Immediately after the acci- !
dent was taken from the wrecked coach
and brought to Sausalito. She was
suffering from nervous shock and pain
the shoulder was dislocated and that
she had possibly sustained internal in
juries. After the shoulder had been set
she was removed on one of the regular
trains to Dr. Howitt's sanatorium in
San Rafael.
Superintendent Braswell of the North
Shore lice was a very busy and a very
nervous official yesterday afternoon,
and could hardly check his hurry for
an interview. There had not been a se
rious smash-up on the Marin coast
lines for more than a year.
"It is one of those cases," said he,
"where an experienced and reliable
railroad man misses the signal he
? should catch and goes wrong with his
train. There is little to be said except
that the motor engineer, Wosser, did
I not observe the semaphore set as a dan-
I ger sign In time to stop his car before
it went into the suburban freight train
standing on the sidetrack. "Wos3er did
catch sight of the signal and did check
up as he was switching over toward
Ritchie's train, and this materially les
sened the force of the collision. I have
not heard the motorman's statement,
but I believe he says that he could not
see the signal till he was down on the
switch."
SHOULDER DISLOCATED.
Ritchie, the injured engineer of the
freight train, was taken to the Taylor
Sanatorium in this city.
Confusion reigned in the cars. "Wom
en and children climbed out of the
coaches through the shattered windows.
Many of them narrowly missed tread
ing on the deadly third rail.
That there were only two injured
seems miraculous. So terrific was the
impact that twisted masses of iron
from the wrecked locomotive were
strewn along the track for several
hundred yards. There were two oil cars
in the freight train. These were hurled
from the rails and badly battered. Had
the oil become ignited the disaster
would have been terrible. Fortunately
the fire in the engine was smothered
in the wreckage.
Stanley Armstrong, an artist, was in
one of the cars. He extricated several
frightened women from the wr^ck.
Armstrong says:
"We approached Mill Valley Junction
at a lively rate of speed. There was a
sudden crash and I was thrown from
my seat. I think it is a miracle that
some, of us were not killed."
Tha San Rafael local on the North
Shore road crashed into the suburban
freight train yesterday at Mill Valley
Junction. The motor car of the local
almost demolished the locomotive of
the freight train and was piled up on a
flat car.
There were about sixty passengers on
the local. Only one of these sustained
any serious injuries. Mrs. S. Serf of
San Rafael was hurled from her seat
and Jammed against the wall of the
motor car. Her shoulder was dislo
cated. Engineer W. L. Ritchie of the
freight train was pinned in the yreck
age of his cab. One of his legs was
fractured.
The accident was caused by Motor
man E. F. Wosser's disregard of the
danger signal displayed at the station.
He should have brought his train to a
full stop. Instead of doing so he
whirled past the station at full speed.
The switchman, J. F. Tobin, had left
the switch open, and the electric train
collided with the freight. This is the
explanation given by the company s
officers. - â i

i As the result of the Board of Super
visors levying last June a special tax
of .0071 cents on every $100 of assessed'
valuation to pay the interest and re
demption on bonds for the improve
ment of Telgraph Hill, before the val
idity of the entire bond issue was
passed on by the Supreme Court, the
taxpayers of this city will be required
to pay into the city treasury the sum
of $35,760 for this purpose without
cause.
The money will be collected, but ow
ing to the Supreme Court deciding
Monday that the Telegraph Hill pro
ject failed to carry, the amount so col
lected will remain Idle in the treasury.
It cannot be used for any other "pur
pose and may not be returned unless
the taxpayer files a written protest
and a subsequent claim for the repay
ment of the taxes so paid.
Of the amount to be collected, the
sum of $20,860 was supposed to repre
sent the first year's interest on the en
tire Issue of $597,000, the estimated
cost of parking Telegraph Hill. The
sum of $14,000 was the first contribu
tion of the taxpayers to the fund for
the redemption of the bonds, which
were to have matured in forty years.
While the tax paid for this speci
fic purpose amounts to but a few cents
for many Individual taxpayers, It
counts up in cases where taxes are
paid on an assessment of hundreds of
thousands of dollars. It is not likely
that small property holders will take
the trouble to file a formal protest
against the payment of the tax, al
though the large holders will undoubt
edly take that precaution. The same
principle is exemplified in the collec
tion of taxes under the special levy of
15 cents for schools and hospitals.
About $260,000 of that money is now
in the city treasury and cannot be used
because writen protests were not filed
by all property owners.
Two days after the election for the
Issuance of bonds, September 29, 1903,
The Call printed an article under the
caption "Telegraph Hill Project
Beaten," showing by a simple arith
metical calculation that the proposi
tion failed by 273 votes to receive the
legal two-thirds of the total vote cast
at the election to insure its being car
ried. The total vote polled at the elec
tion, according to the official returns,
was 27,308. Two-thirds of this is 18,
205. The proposition polled 17.932 in fa
vor and 81S7 asainst. While the propo
sition polled two-thirds of the total
vote of 26,119 cast for or against it it
did not get two-thirds of the entire
vote cast at the election, as the char
ter In amended state required.

Robert F. Baker, teamster, made his
third appearance as a defendant before
Judge Cabaniss. and was fined $10 for
battery on. 10-year-old Ira Rayburn of
r.S7 Xatoma street. Then the court in
formed Mr. Baker that his next convic
tion will be followed by as long a term
of imprisonment as can legally be pre
scribed.for his offense.
Mr. Baker's debut in the Police Court
was made two years ago, when he was
fined for obstructing: a street car.
Twelve months later he was arraigned
<Sn a charge of mayhem, he having bit
ten off a portion of an opponent's nasal
organ in a rough-and-tumble fight. His
latest offense was committed last "Mon

Thomas. Williams, colored, faces two
charges of burglary against him on
Judge ycgnlan's calendar, both com
plaints 'hriving been sworn to by Detec
tive Lewin of the State special police.
-The prosecution alleges that Mr. Wil
liams feloniously entered a Southern
Pacific dining-car at Third and Town
send streets and abstracted therefrom
various viands, including one ham and
some* bottled liquors.
In response to a query from the
bench as to whether the burglarized
larder contained either chicken or wa
termelon, Mr. Williams grinned and
gave a negative answer.
It was a fiercely fought case. The as
sistant District Attorney was \ flanked
by special counsel for the prosecution,
and Mr. Gannon had an able and elo
quent professional pleader. Mrs. Savia
was so deeply affected by the remem
brance of the agonizing cries of her
"polly" while Mr. Gannon was squeez
ing its body that on two occasions she
ceased testifying to press her hands to
her sides and sigh, "Oh, dear." Mr.
Savis became so mixed in his recountal
of the parrot incident that the Judge
had to straighten him out so that the
lawyers could ascertain what he said,
what the defendant said and what the
bird said.
The cigar cutter was produced in evi
dence, but the parrot was not there to
testify, and a continuance till to-mor
row was ordered.
It could not have been its colorâ a
brilliant green â that brought upon Mrs.
Ellse Savis' parrot the wrath of John
Gannon, for Mr. Gannon's physical
characteristics denoted Hibernian an
cestry. Nor was it anything the bird
might have said that provoked the as
sault, for various witnesses testified
that its rather stunted vocabulary is
devoid of offensive words. Therefore,
according to the opinion of Mrs. Savis,
it must have been pure cussedness that
prompted Mr. Gannon to take her
feathered treasure from its gilded cage
and squeeze it between his rough
hands until its shrieks for aid were
most piteous.
But compressing the parrot was not
the only act of violence charged against
Mr. Gannon as he stood before Police
Judge Fritz yesterday morning. The
prosecution alleged that after his mal
treatment of the bird, which occurred
upon the sidewalk fronting the restau
rant jointly owned and managed by
Mrs. Savis and her husband, Vasolos,
at 437 Hayes street, the defendant en
tered the cafe and orally abused Mr.
Savis, calling him a dashed dago and
a double-blanked foreigner, until he
was forcibly ejected,, and that then he
hurled through the glass panel of the
door one heavy metal cigar cutter, the
missile striking Mr. Savis' head and
removing therefrom a portion of the
cuticle.
The case is said to be creating in
the Japanese colony an interest scarce
ly eclipsed by that manifested in the
proceedings at Port Arthur, as Matsu
maru Is accepted as the guide, counsel
or and friend of his compatriots in all
their dealings with the authorities of
this nation, to say nothing of his un
disputed prestige as a social mentor.
T v he Fuchlgamis, too, have been moving
in the upper Japanese circle.
D. Fuchigami, who is responsible for
thft circulation of the Japanese Ameri
can, will answer in Judge Cabaniss'
court the charge of criminal libel,
sworn to by G. Matsumaru, and spe
cifically accusing him of publishing in
the aforementioned journal certain de
famatory statements concerning the
complainant and his wife, Waka. The
defendant is held in a $500 bond.
According to the complaint, Fuchi
gami went to Japan and there took
unto himself a bride in the person of
Waka, a pretty little woman, and
brought her to this country. To obtain
her entry he induced Matsumaru to
go before the Immigration Com
sloner acd vouch for Waka's respecta
bility, and Waka was allowed to land.
Then appeared in the Japanese Ameri
can an editorial article expressive of
regret that the writer had lent his good
offices in the matter of Waka's land
ing, as subsequent developments sat
isfied him that she was brought to this
country for immoral purposes. The
writer added that his first information
to that effect was imparted by Dr.
Nishikata, and that it was proved cor
rect by his own investigation. There
fore he publicly apologized to his read
ers and to the great United States Gov
ernment for having been unwittingly
instrumental in the landing of Waka.
Cornelius O'Brien and Cornelius
Sweeney, confirmed opium devotees,
convicted of stealing tools from a
Broadway store, were sentenced to six
months apiece bv Judge Fritz.
J. B. Patrick, accused of obstructing
the sidewalk fronting his place of bus
iness. 113 Sansome street, by allowing
an elevator to remain open, announced
his Intention of applying to the Board
of Public Works for a special permit
to continue the obstruction. To which
Judge Cabaniss retorted by expressing
douUt that even so mighty a body as
the Hoard of Public Works could le
gally give any one special permission to
break the law, which clearly prohibits
obstruction of the citv's public foot
ways. Then the case was continued
for a month to see what the defendant
really intends to do about it.
The lady was still recounting her
grievances when the Judge continued
the case and set her bail at $250.
Oscar Daly had his wife. Bridget, ar
rested on the charge of threatening to
shoot him while they were visiting a
lawyer with the mutual object of get
ting their marital relationship dis
solved. During a discussion over the
division of their common property, Os
car told Judge Fritz, he was scared al
most to death by Bridget drawing
from the folds of her gown a big re
volver and aiming it at his person, at
the same time expressing a desire to
nil him chock full of lead.
Mrs. Daly not only denied the alleged
pistol display, but declared that of all
the contemptible specimens of man
hood she had ever met or heard or
read about, Oscar was the worst. Such
a thing as living in amity with him
was an impossibility, and she pitied
the woman who would take him for
husband after he is at liberty to marry
again. Her wedded life, Mrs.* Daly
further averred, has been an . almost
unbroken fight with Oscar, he being
Invariably the aggressor. Not satis
fied with beating her, she said, he stole
her clothing and pawned it for money
with which to prime himself with
whisky to beat her again.
Patrick Smart testified that as he
lay where he had been knocked down,
in a Fourth street saloon, James M.
Lininger kept him pinned to the floor
by standing upon his face while sev
eral other men with whom he had been
drinking robbed him of a gold watch
and his spare cash. Robbery is the
charge against Mr. Lininger and Judge
Cabaniss will hand down a decision
day after to-morrow.
the beaming response, "and I don't
wonder that you hardly knew me, for
ever since I got out of jail my friends
have been saying-, 'My, but you're the
changed woman,' and the beauty of it,
Judge, is that I feel Just as good as I
look, for I tell you there's nothing like
re3t and regular eating to improve
one's feelings and I'm sure if it wasn't
for the disgrace of being in jail I
would just as lief stay there as not, for
as -long as a lady behaves herself up
there they treat her right, and if you
hear any complaints from prisoners
you can bet your life that the prison
ers themselves"
"Twenty-four hours â take her
away!" thundered the Judge.
"Well, well, I suppose you're busy
now, so I'll say no more, but some day
I'm coming in to have a nice long chat
with you, and then we'll talk"
The remainder of Mrs. O'Connor's
speech was heard only by the bailiff
who -escorted her to the upward-bound
elevator.
