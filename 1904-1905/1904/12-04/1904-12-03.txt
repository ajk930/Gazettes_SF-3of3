ACCUSERS OF POLICE
REFUSING TO TESTIFY
AT the investigation begun by the Police Commissioners yesterday no proof of bribery in China
town was shown. Two important witnesses, R. A. Crothers and Fremont Older, failed to
appear. Citations will be issued for them if necessary and the matter may be taken into the
courts to test the Commissioners' authority. Gambling houses flourish, reap large profits and
regularly charge up sums of money to a mysterious "Incidentals" account.:

Charges of Bribery.
â¦
Ruef Makes a Bitter Attack
Chinese Will Not TalkUnless
Assured of Protection.
. Eo far as furnishing any positive evi
fience of the existence and distribution
of a "sack" for the protection of gam
bling hcruses in Chinatown the investi
gation started by the Police Commls
eioners yesterday afternoon was a fail
ure. Two witnesses. R. A. Crothers and
'Fremont Older, who had been sub
penaed to appear and tell what they
knew of the doings in the Chinese
Quarter, were not present. Their fail- 'â 
ure to appear aroused the ire of Abe
Ruef, who in scathing terms, some of
them unfit for publication, denounced
the pioprietor and editor of the even
ing paper which had attacked the de
partment.
At the conclusion of his address Ruef
eaid: "I now move you, gentlemen,
that warrants be issued for the arrest
or these men and that if necessary the
entire Pt/lice Department, fortified with
rubber gloves, be turned loose to drag
them from their beds that they may
be compelled to either verify the
charges they have made or admit that I
they are false."
Despite the objections of Attorney
Hickey, representing Crothers and
Older, the two were again ordered- to
appear before the Commissioners at 2
o'clock to-day. If they fall to come at
that time a citation will be issued and
cisobedlence of this will result in an
Attempt to punish them for contempt.
As both sides admit that there is some
doubt as to the authority of the board
to punish for contempt in proceedings
of this kind, a failure to comply with
the mandate of the Commissioners may
bring the whole matter into the courts.
Attorney Hickey seems anxious to have
the matter tied up, as he contests the
right of the Commissioners to hold the
Investigation. When the section of
the charter granting such power was
read to him, he waved it aside con
temptuously, saying: "There has not
been a Eectlon of that charter brought
before the Supreme Court yet that has
rot been declared unconstitutional."
GAMBLING NOT DENIED.
â¢Aside from the bitter denunciatory
epeech of Ruef and some tiffs between
bins and Hickey. the proceedings of the
afternoon were somewhat prosaic, but
they gave promise of rich things in the
future. That gambling games were
running nightly in Chinatown was not
<Â«sied. A line of inquiry was started,
in accordance with the report made by
.CommiEEioner Hutton, tending to show
that there was an agreement between
the police and the owners of the gam
. bling houses as to which house should
be raided, on what night and how
many men should be arrested and
fined. The prison record was consult
ed in support cf this theory of the
Commissioners.
In all this there was no reference
. made to any distribution of funds to
the Mayor, the Commissioners, the
Chief cr Abe Ruef. Everybody admit
ted having heard of the existence of
â¢that "sack," but.when.it came down
to cold facts the bag of coin seemed
as elusive as the pot of gold which
children fondly believe hangs on the
end of a rainbow. It was all passed
up to the naughty highbinder men and
these same highbinders formed the
basis of making a novel if not alto
gether new proposition to the police.
.The Commissioners were informed
with entire frankness that several-Chi
neee. members of the Educational So
ciety, would willingly testify as to the
wicked ways of the guardians of the
city's peace provided they were as
sured, of police protection. It was to
be distinctly understood that the Ce
lestials did not want the police officers
to escort them about the streets. They
pimply wanted an officer stationed out
side the . doorways of their abodes to
see that no one came in to molest
them. The plan was not looked on
â with favor. The Chinaman is noted for
wily ways and the protection of the
police in the manner suggested would
offer an . excellent opportunity for a
number of Celestials to secure a "cor
ner'' in gambling houses without fear
â¢of molestation.
The first witness called was Irving
McAfee, a messenger boy, who accom
panied Commissioner Hutton to China
town on night. He said he
did not know who Hutton was, but
that Hutton had Riven him a sealed
envelope and Instructed him to deliver
'it to Sergeant Ellis of the Chinatown
6<juad. This was at 7:50. After mak
ing numerous inquiries he finally
-found Ellis in one of the Chinese thea
ters and delivered him the message at
5:25. He knew nothing of the contents
of the envelope.
Commissioner Hutton then took the
stand and told of sending the messen
ger to find Ellis. He said the envelope
contained instructions to Ellis to meet
him at the corner of Powell and Clay
streets that they might visit tfte gam
bling houses together. Ellis met him
at 9:30 and they visited several places,
but found them all deserted. A pecu
liar circumstance connected with this,
however, was the' fact that a short
time before the note Â«cas delivered to
Ellis the streets in Chinatown .were
practically deserted, but when the two
started to make the . rounds ' the streets
> ere filled with "chattering: Chinamen,
The San Francisco Call.
all looking in the direction from which
we were coming," as the Commissioner
expressed it. He further said that El
lis also noticed the unusual number of
men on the street and said that "they
must all be turning out to have a look
at us."
HCTTOX'S RAID.
Commissioner Hutton then related
how on Tuesday night he had visited
one of these same resorts at 820 Wash
ington street with Attorney L. G. Car
penter and Officer Minehan and suc
ceeded in arresting more than eighty
Chinese. In it were eight tables, a
desk and four iron safes. Men were
playing at the tables and the money
was carried to and from the desk in
the center of the room in wicker bas
kets running on wires, similar to the
method in vogue in the department
stores. The coin was usually wrapped
in handkerchiefs. When a search of I
the premises was made, after the play
ers and lookers-on had been removed
to the City Prison, several hundred
dollars, chiefly in silver, was found In
the desk. Some of the *t coin was
wrapped in linen handkerchiefs, some
was loose and the remainder done up
in cartridges.
â¢ -Crnnmissloner Hutton said he "had
very little difficulty in getting into the
room. With Carpenter, he stepped from
a coupe and walked into the room on
the heels of an entering Chinaman,
while Officer Minehan ran around to the
side and blockaded the "getaway." He
was surprised at the great number of
men in the room, as when he had vis
ited it the night before there were but
two or three persons there and no evi
dence cf any games being played. One
man vras feigning sleep and the others
were making a pretense of cleaning up
the room.
"I had always heard," said Hutton,
"that it was impossible for a Police
Commissioner to visit Chinatown with
out his advent being heralded, soli tried
the experiment. On Monday night no
one knew of my plans, yet within five
minutes after the delivery of my note
to Sergeant Ellis all the gambling
houses were deserted. On the following
night, when it was utterly impossible
for any one to have known of my plans.
I found a room full of men. with games
in full blast."
At this point Attorney Ruef inter
rupted with the question: "Did you dis
cover any evidence to show that any
money had been paid by the Chinese
for protection?"
"I did not," was -. the - reply. "I will
say that Commissioner Drinkhouse has
at times expressed dissatisfaction with
the way in which things were run, and
said he would like to see everything
cleared up. Like others, I have' heard
many rumors, but have been unable to
find any direct evidence of guilt. For
instance, in March, when Sergeant
Cook was transferred, I was told that
on the following Saturday night the
gambling-houses would be opened. An
attorney for the Chinese told me that
money was to be paid for the privilege,
and mentioned the amount. I went up
there that Saturday night and found
that the houses were all wide open."
"Did you hear such rumors before
you were made Commissioner or prior
to the election of Mayor Schmitz?"
was asked by Ruef.
"I did," was the response.
"Are you able to. confirm the state
ment that there is a sack?"
"No." .
Hutton then told his experiences and
observations regarding the number of
Chinese arrested. From these he de
duced that to make things easy the oc
cupants of gambling-houses were noti
fied a few minutes before a raid and all
but a handful escaped through the
"getaways." "It seemed strange to me,"
he said, "that out of a houseful of 100
or more all could escape but from five
to ten men. In fact, it is ridiculous.- If
eighty or a hundred men could escape,
all could. Now, in support of this let us
refer to the prison register for -the last
month."
The November register was brought
In and showed the following arrests
by Sergeant Ellis and posse: Novem
ber 7, 5 men; November 11. 20; Novem
ber 19, 6 men from Waverly place; No
vember 21, 8 men from Jackson street:
November 22, 5 men from Ross alley;
November 26, 8 men ' from .Waverly
place; .November 29, 7 men from Soof
ford alley. . Hutton ,; passed this show
ing up without further comment.
"INCIDENTALS, $40."
The evidence captured by .Hutton In
his raid was then Introduced. It con
sisted of the books; of the gambline
house, coin and gambling parapher
nalia. An Interpreter, was" brought in
and translations made from the books
of the â  firm. What would correspond
with the white man's . daybook* showed
some interesting features.- While small
items like matches - and stationery,
some of them amdunting"; to -not "over
50 cents, were carefully itemized,, there
was an ever-recurrent weekly.' item of
$40 for incidentals. In fact it seemed
so ludicrous when the interpreter read
off: "Matches, 50 cents; soap.'. $1; in
cidentals. $40." that notwithstanding

Mrs. Cassle Chadwick, 'and his bond
was fixed "at $10,000.^"
NEW YORK, Dec. 2.â Interest in the
affairs of Mrs. Cassle L. ~ Chadwick of
Cleveland took a "new turn late to-day,
when a dispatch from Cleveland an
nounced that bankruptcy proceedings
had been brought against her by
Jacques Krakauer, a New York lace
dealer, with an establishment on Fifth
avenue. Krakauer in an interview to
night said that Mrs. Chadwick had
been a customer In his establishment
for some time, but that he had not in
structed the Cleveland attorneys to
take action against her. He said:
"I simply followed rar usual custom
of having my Cleveland attorneys to
look after my Interests."
Mrs. Chadwick's movements to-day
were also a subject of much interest,
and when she left the Holland House,
where she has been living, and went to
the Central Trust Company building in
Wall street her appearance attracted
crowds of people. The result of her
visit in Wall" street was not announced,
but it is understood she called on a
firm of lawyers there.
AGAIN VISITS LAWYERS.
There was a story in circulation that
Mrs. Chadwick contemplated leaving
for Eurooe to-morrow. Philip Carpen
ter, one of her counsel, however, said
to-night that his client would not leave
for Europe, and added:
"In fact, she will not leave this coun
try until every. dollar of her indebted
ness has been paid."
Carpenter also made the statement
that Mrs. Chadwick is a "very wealthy
woman," and "amply able to care for
all the claims against her."
Mrs. Chadwick was in consultation
this afternoon with the firm of Butler,
Notman, Joline & Mynders, lawyers
of Wall street. ' It was said on eood au
thority to-night that this firm has been
Mrs. Chadwick's counsel in this city
for a number of years, and one of her
lawyers said that the fact that the
firm had done business for a prominent
millionaire, whose name has appeared
in .connection with notes In this case,
was simply a coincidence.
DELAY IN NEWTOX CASE.
It was also : stated to-night that no
money or securities had been passed in
the Newton suit, but that Newton had
been given, assurances as to a settle

bly be paid in a few days. Rumors
were current to-day that there had been
a hitch in the progress of the Newton
suit, but these stories could not be
confirmed. Attorney George Ryall. for
Banker Newtpn of Boston, said: *
"Statements that Mrs. Cassie L.
Chadwick is to pay only $78,000 of Mr.
Newton's claim at this time are untrue.
The person who came to Mrs. Chad

amount of the claims of $190,800, with
a reasonable amount of interest besides.

ST.rLOUIS, Dec. 3.â A general : alarm

Wirld's;^Fair ground, ;at i3: 30;: o'clock
this â  morning,* and .Avas"followed ; a'"few/
minutes : later by "an alarm from -'the
Varied Industries . building. Fifteen
minutes' later .another alarm came in
from the j Palace of Mines and Metal
lurgy.
These alarms caused the wildest ex
citement, and for a time It appeared
that the entire exposition was doomed
to destruction by fire. /"At 1:15 a. m.,
however, it was reported that the Va
ried Industries and the Mines and Met
allurgy building fires , were under con
trol and that the World's Fair fire de
partment and Hale's fire-fighters,
which were working desperately on the
main fire on the Pike, hoped to prevent
the spread of the flames beyond the
territory in which they were then rag
ing.
At J2:50 o'clock the police arrested a
man giving the name of Arthur V.
Dunn in the Hereafter building on the
Pike. They claim that he was in the
act of setting fire to that structure
when caught. They believe that all
the fires,- which started one after an
other, were the work of Incendiaries
and that they have captured one of the
gang who deliberately set out to burn
the exposition buildings.
ART COLLECTIONS GONE.
The first fire on the Pike was In the
concession known as "Fair Japan."
Some of the most valuable collections
ofi art, porcelain and bronze to be
found at the exposition were in these
buildings. The structures were all of
frame and burned fiercely and the en
tire concession was badly damaged.
"Quo Vadis," another Pike conces
sion,, and quite near "Fair Japan,"
caught fire . almost simultaneously
and burned as fiercely. The fire spread
rapidly to the Old St. Louis and Bow
ery concesisons and â  in a short time
these frail structures were wiped out
of existence.
Carl Hagenback's wild animal show
is but a stone's throw from "Fair
Japan," and it; was "at first reported
that this great concession was burn
ing, but the report proved untrue.
At 1:16 the World's Fair fire de

limits. : â¢
Persons connected with "Ancient

made interesting by reason of reports
that were received concerning the work
that has been performed by the Gov

during, the last year by the . United

in its attempt to Improve . its forests
and its uses of and conservation of

OROVILLE
MAN FIGHTS
WILDCAT
j Beast Springs Upon
Him From Under .
a Residence. . â¢
Special Dispatch to The Ca!l
OROVILLE, Dec. 2.â Travers Wood
man, an employe of Wells, Fargo â¢ &
Co., had a most remarkable encounter
with a wildcat this morning in one of
the most thickly settled portions of the
residence district.
While Woodman was on his way to
work Mrs. Ham, a widow, who resides
on Montgomery street, east of. First
avenue, called to him from her. door
and in an excited manner told him
that there was some wild animal under
her house which had offered to attack
her when she had left her porch a few
minutes before. The house stands
three or four feet from the ground and
Woodman, without hesitation, crawled
under the building to Investigate with
out taking the precaution to provide
himself with a weapon.
He had hardly disappeared under the
porch before he came out, his exit be
ing hastened by a wildcat, not quite
full grown, but with all the ferocity of
a tiger, he had disturbed.
Almost before Woodman could
straighten up the animal leaped at
him. Its jaws closed on hi3 trousers
leg. Woodman grasped the beast by
the neck and forced its head to the
ground. He has muscles well hardened
by toil, but he could not hold the cat.
which, though it broke Woodman's
hold, still kept Its jaws fastened to hla
trousers.
In the struggle that followed In some
manner Woodmanâ he does not know
how â got hold of the animal's hind leg.
Exerting all his strength he broke the
beast's hold. upon his .trousers. High
in the air he swung It and then brought
the cat's head crashing 1 down upon the
hard ground. The hammering process
was kept up until Woodman could feel
that there was no life left In the ani
mal's body. Then he carried his prize

CONGRESS WILL CONVENE MONDAY AND THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS
AT THE CAPITAL OF THE NATION ARE BUSY ISSUING THEIR ANNUAL REPORTS
FORECAST OF THE WORK
AWAITING CONGRESS.
r HE second ses'sion of the Fifty-eighth Congress will be called to order next Monday^ The
calendars of both houses are crowded and manv new bills will be introduced. The question
â ,-â â¢..â¢â >â  â  - . â¢*
of tariff revision will take up much time, as will also the trusts and the river and harbor ap
... t l
propriation bill. The subject of reciprocity will be given consideration, and legislation for 4 the
Philippines will claim the attention of the members. Currency legislation will be talked about,
but it probnbly will not be enacted. The following forecast will give an idea of the vast amotint
of legislation to be considered during the session.
Calendars of Both Houses Are Crowded and There
â¢v "â â¢â -â¢â  Is Talk of an Extra Session.
â¢.WASHINGTON. Dec. 2.â On the (
stroke of. II", Monday, the' second f?es- j
eion.cf the Fifty-eighth Congress will
be called to order by President Pro
Tern. Frye in the Senate and by Speak
er Cannon in the House. When the
gavels of the presiding officers sum
tnon thÂ« Senators and Representatives
to duty nearly every member will be
in his Feat, but only routine business
v Ut be transacted. The chaplains will
pray, the rolls will be called, the reg
ular resolutions of notification will be
passed, â¢ committees to inform the
President will be ' appointed and ad
journment will -follow out of respect
for. the deceased members. The Pres
ident's message generally is received
and read "the first day, but the Sen
ate is punctilious in certain matters
and it is almost sure to adjourn as a
tribute of respect to the late Senator |
Hoar of ' Massachusetts and the late j
Senator Quay of Pennsylvania. The
â message, therefore, probably will not
be 'rea&.'until Tuesday.
After the opening day, when the
message of the President is read, the
regular' business of the session will
â¢hegin and the legislative wheels will
â¢ETind steadily unti4 aiarch 4, 1905.
There is plenty to do. The calendars
of both houses are loaded with bills |
of all kinds; hundreds of new bills j
â¢will be introduced and committees j
ere ready to report enoush to keep |
Cot"*refs busy for twelve Aanths, but
.In the three months Congress will
probably do little more than pass the
'regular" annual appropriation bills.)
There- has been some talk of a possi
ble, extra session. The result of the I
November election was scarcely
"known before this talk begau. Here
tofQre <?xtr;i session rumors have been
lield.in abeyance until the holiday re
cess or at least until after the election
rf-turns have been digested, but this
year the discussion began before the |
."President know how many votes he
â would have in the electoral college.
The only reason why such a session
i?hould.be called is because there is a
demand in certain quarters for a re
vision' of the tariff, but many of the
incoming Congressmen during the last
Vwo' weeks have made it plain that
they dtÂ» not want tariff revision, and,
further, that they do not want an ex
ti a. session.
Jr yARIl'F REVISION TALK.
There is one feature of the tariff revi
sion- Jalk that has some substance.
More . revenue must be had or there
niust be a curtailment of expenditures.
With the increasing annual appropria
tions, a river and harbor bill, increase
of the navy, the Panama canal and
other features of extraordinary dis
bursement there will be need of more
money .than present customs and in
ternal revenues provide. An intimation I
has- been made that curtailment will
Eatisf-y. many "Conj-'Tessional leaders, but
the majority may determine otherwise,
in which event some revenue legislation
,may be necessary and an extra session
for that purpose may be called. But
this is said to be a remote contingency,
and the probabilities, 'according to the
leaders who are here, are that there will
be. TieSther tariff legislation nor an ex
tra session.
Coupled with tariff legislation discus
stop is the -subject of reciprocity. A
number of proposed reciprocity treaties
have been and still are reposing In the
pigeon-holes of the Senate. During the
coming three months there may be
eome talk about these treaties, but the
indications are they will not be serious
ly considered. So strong has been the
opposition to them that it has never
"been .considered worth while to report
"them from the Committee on Foreign
Relations, to. which they were referred.
There was considerable talk during the
last session of Congress concerning tar-
Iff revision, and the suggestion was
made by several prominent leaders that
â¢any revision that was necessary could
be accomplished during the short ses-
Ejon -of Congress, the. idea belngr that
revision would be o.n the lines of re
duction and would meet with little or
â no* opposition. If more revenue is need
ed, and Jt is found necessary to add
â¢some internal revenue taxes, opposition
may be more pronounced. Revenue leg
islation ' of any kind is sure to create
considerable talk in the Senate, and
that "means delay. In fact, it has be
'come known that under present condi
tions legislation during the short ses
sion Is enacted by practically unan
imous consent. Any half-dozen Sen
ators who determine to defeat a bill
ha-ve the power to do so, with the privi
']<â¢Â£-<â¢â  of unlimited debate. In the House

stringent rules enable the majority to
transact all business it desires, and so
far as that body is concerned there Is
no difficulty about any legislation that
may be attempted, but if the leaders
do not want tariff revision or change in
the revenue laws nothing will be done.
PHILIPPINE LEGISLATION.
The unfinished business. in the Sen
| ate is a bill passed by the House pro
viding for the construction of railroads
in the Philippine Islands by a guar
entee of 5 per cent income upon the
money invested in such roads. The bill
also provides for issuing Philippine
bonds for other internal improvements
in the islands and in several
other particulars amends .the Phil-,
ippine laws passed by Congress.
| The bill met with a great deal
of opposition during the last Con
gress, but Senator Lodge, who has it
in charge, says he will press it from i
i the beginning- of the session and hopes
] to secure Its passage. The principal
opposition was to the provision which
guaranteed an income to the railroads,
and little objection was made to ether j
features of the bill. Another bill for j
the Philippines, which has been urged i
by Secretary Taft and the President, !
as well as neariy every. one interested j
in the Philippines, provides for a ma- |
terial reduction of the duty on sugar |
and tobacco, as well as other Philip-
I pine products. In fact, free entry of
) these products has been recommended.
A demand for a reduction to 25 per
cent has been quite frequently present
ed to Congress.
I Another measure which received the )
sanction of the House last session, but !
which has never been pushed in the I
Senate, is the statehood measure which
provides for two States, doubling up
the Territories of Oklahoma and In
dian Territory ac one and Arizona and
New Mexico as another.
Should the House of Representatives
decide to impeach Judge Charles
â¢Swayne of the Northern District, of
Florida, the business conditions of
the Senate would be complicated.
After an investigation a majority of
the House Committee on Judiciary
in the last session recommended im
peachment. Consideration of the resolu
tion was postponed until December 13,
the beginning of thÂ« second week of
the short session. Meanwhile the Ju
diciary Committee was instructed to
take further testimony, a task it be
gan two weeks ago. Present indica
tions are that the House will not au
thorize An Impeachment, or, if it does,
the action will be taken so late in the
session that the real proceedtngs-"will
so over until the next Congress. There
are precedents for such action in other
impeachment cases that have been be
fore Congress. . -
TKOUBLESOME SMOOT CASE.
i It is somewhat doubtful If a vote will]
be reached in the Senate in the case
of Senator Reed Smoot o* Utah. This
case attracted a great deal of attention
last session when the Committee on
Privileges and Elections summoned the
heads of the Mormon church to tell
what had been going on of a polygam
ous character in Utah,. and' thousands
of persons* petitioned daily*-' to have
Smoot ejected from the Senate. A score
or more of witnesses are yet to be ex
amined, and the defense has not even
begun, tÂ»o that it is evident that before
a report is made ~ to the Senate the
session, will be so far spent that no
serious attempt will be made to reach
a vote .upon Senator Smoofs . title.
Some question lias arisen as to whether
the case lapses with the end of" the
present Congress. It was the opinion
of the late Senator Hoar that the pro
ceedings would end with the Congress
and an entire new case would have to
be commenced if it was found desirable
to continue the case against Smoot.
The last session passed a bill provid
ing for a commission composed of five
Senators and five Representatives to in
vestigate and report a measure for re
storing the Merchant Marine of the
United States. The commission was in
structed to report on the first day of
the coming session and it is expected
that this will be done. There has been
a great deal of anxiety manifested by
men of both political parties to secure
legislation of this character and if any
measure can be agreed upon which will
receive the. support of both .parties it
will no doubt be speedily passed. , .
Some doubt'exists among the mem
bers of both houses as to whether, addi
tional Chinese . exclusion legislation Is
necessary: It 1 has been held that the
law would expire this month, as it was
founded upon a treaty which also ex
pires. A new. treaty is being negotiated
and an exclusion law to meet its terms
may be necessary. The people of the
Pacific Coast have been insisting upon
nit-re rigid exclusion than that known
as the Platt law, and if. the question Is
brought up.there will be quite a lengthy
debate.

bill, the Fowler bill and the Hill bill,
as well, as a number of others, are I
pending before committees, but no one t
has shown any particular desire to!
have them passed. In fact, one meas- j
ure is antagonistic to another and,
with no apparent danger- to the fin

not experts in the matter of currency
i law cannot be induced to push these
measures forward to the exclusion of

',: DISCUSSION OF TRUSTS.
Reduced representation in Southern
States which have by one form or an
other disfranchised negroes.will.be a
theme of discussion, but not action,
during the winter. The ; Republican
national platform is' interpreted by
some of the more radical members
of the party to call for such reduction
and they will go at the subject from.
[ the beginning. It is well understood
that to bring about anything like a
reduced representation would require
much more time than a three months'
session of Congress which expires by
i limitation.
1 No doubt a number of bills to pro
; hibit or control campaign contributions
will be presented, as that matter be
! came an issue at the close of the re
i cent campaign. Just how it can be
; reached is yet to be ascertained, as
| there are so many ways in which a
| law of this kind can be avoided.
The trusts will receive attention, at
least in debate, although some doubt is
expressed about any effective legisla
tion being passed. Following a cam
paign in which the trusts were made a
vital issue it is natural to expect that
there must be a great deal of talk on
the subject whenever there is an op
portunity.
Interstate commerce legislation in
some form or another Is always pending
in Congress and there may be an effort
to enlarge the powers of the Interstate
Commerce Commission so as to allow
It to fix rates. Railroad in
; terests have opposed and will
; continue to oppose, this measure.
Another pending measure is . to
permit pooling and this is opposed^by
the shippers. With so much contention
there is little prospect that anything
will be done. A bill to amend the law
for the safety of employes of railroads
has been reported and it is expected
that it will pass.
A bill which has agitated Congress
for a number of years providing for
eight hours' work only, on all Govern
ment contracts, no doubt will be report
ed from the Senate Committee on Labor,
which has given much time to hear
ings. A bill of similar character was
lost in the last Congress by being
crowded out by other business. ;.-â¢
PURE FOOD BILL.
Senator Heyburn of Idaho has given
notice that he will call up the pure
food bill during the first week ef the
session and the friends of the measure
hppe to have it passed. . â¢
A measure which created a great deal
of interest in the last session and which
no doubt will cause considerable discus
sion if it comes up again is a bill pro
viding for several large camp sites in
different sections of the country, for the
use of the regular army and militia for
drill purposes. The localities most like
ly to get the sites If the bill becomes
a law are energetically pushing it to
the front while disappointed rivals are
opposing it. .â â¢-:-_â ;/â 
Senator Fairbanks, who has only
three months to serve as a Senator be
fore he becomes Vice President, and
who as chairman of the Committee on
Public Buildings and Grounds has en
deavored to secure a bill providing a
building for the Departments of State,
Justice and Commerce and Labor, will
try to bring about favorable action on
the bill in the ninety days he is to re
main a national legislator. There. are
other public building bills pending, but
it is not expected any general omnibus
bill will be pushed at this session.
Irrigation has become a permanent
legislative topic. Interwoven closely
with the public land question, it has re
sulted in setting two House committees
by the ears and creating a wide differ
ence of opinion among Senators from
Western States. Several measures in
tended as amendments to the irrigation
law have been suggested and are before
Congress. If the Western men" were
united .they no doubt . could' secure
some legislation, but being divided ibis
quite likely, that nothing /will .be done.
RIVER- APPROPRIATIONS: V
Two years ago in the long session of
Congress a river and harbor appropria
tion bill was passed, but it was omitted
in the session; which ended -last'April.
It is the intention to pass a. bill at; this

POSTAL DEFICIT
TAKES A JUMP
Nearly Nine Million Dollars
for the Year Owing to
Eural Delivery Extension
CHANGES SUGGESTED
Lower Rate for Parcels for
Country Districts and New
Laws io Stop Swindling
| WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.â An increase
! of 92.3 per cent in the deficiency over
j the previous year is shown by the
flnancialstatement for the postal serv-.
; ice, incorporated in the annual report
I of E. C. Madden. Third Assistant Post
master General, for the fiscal year, end
ing June 30, l'J04. The report shows, '
: however, that the increase in expendi
tures is en account of the rural free de
livery service. Were it not for this ex
! traordinary expenditure the postal ser
vice would now be about self-sustain
jng. The total' receipts from all sources
for the fiscal year were $143,582,624 and
the total expenditures 5152,362,116, leav
ing a deficit of 58,779,492. The deficiency
for the previous year was 54,560,444.
-Madden says: \
'â  "It is, believed that as soun as the
rural free delivery service is fully es
tablished the increase in^the expendi
tures on account of thaf"service each
year will not be more than the normal
increase for other items of the service,
â  and that within a short time after such
normal conditions obtain the postal ser
vice will be again . self-sustaining, a
condition which has not existed since
1883."
Extension of the rural free delivery
service 'has resulted in an increase of
1125 in the number of postofflces discon
tinued during the fiscal year ending
July 30, 1904, According to the annual
report of J. L. Bristow, Fourth Assist
ant Postmaster General, made public
to-day. During the year there were 2549
post Mces established and 5587 discon
tinued. The principal cause of the in
crease in discontinuances has been the
extension of the rural free delivery ser
vice.
At the close of the fiscal year there
were 71,131 postofflces in the United
Statesâ 265 first class, 1204 second class,
3S96 third clasps and 65,766 fourth class.
The rural mail delivery and the ex
tension by private interests of rural t^l- â¢
i ephone service have created a demand
from patrons of rural routes for the de
livery of small packages of merchan
dise on an order to local merchants by
postal card, telephone or o-therwlse. The
value of such packages is small and the
present rate of one ce.nt per ounce the
report says is practically prohibitive.
Bristow recommends that Congress
fix a rate of 3 cents per pound or any
fractional part thereof on packages not
exceeding five pounds, mailed at the
distributing postofnee of any rural free
delivery route. .
It is estimated that 5500,000 will be
needed by thfi department to continue
the establishment fof^jrurgi routes as
fflst as they are favorably reported for
the remainder of the current fiscal year.
Bristow recommends to Congress that
the interstate commerce law be amend
ed so as to, prohibit common carriersâ
to wit, telegraph and express com
panies, or any of their employes, from
aiding and abetting in green goods or
lottery swindles or any other scheme
carried on partly by mail and partly by
common carrier and which is in vio
lation of the postal laws.

One day during the. morning ses
sion will be devoted to counting the
electoral vote cast for the President
and Vice President. The ballots of
electors of the different States are sent
to the President pro tempore of the
Senate and on the second Wednesday
in February the Senate with the forty
five ballot boxes, one from each. State,
will . proceed to the- House, canvass
the vote and declare the result. .It Is
an . interesting fact that although all
machinery is provided for the election
of a President and Vice President and
for the official canvass and declaration
cf the vote, no provision is made for
officially notifying . the men elected.
Both President Roosevelt and Sena
tor Fairbanks , will have to take the
proceedings of the joint session of
Congress as their notification of the
result of the recent election.
Two Senators are to take oath of
office. Philander C. Knox, the succes
sor of Senator Quay from Pennsylva
nia, : and W. Murray Crane, the suc
cessor, of Senator Hoar .from Massa
chusetts, both seats having been made
vacant by death since the last ses
sion. Two chairmanships of commit
tees may be filled at the coming ses
sion. The Senate never filled the va
cancy at the head of the Interoceanlc
Canals Committee after the death of
Senator Hanna, and Senator Hoar's
death leaves a vacancy at the head of
the important Committee on Judici
ary. In all . probability Senator Platt

TRADE GROWS
BY BIG LEAPS
Dun Reports That Eailways
Are Unable to Handle the
Shipments Offered Them
FEW FAILUEES NOTED
Bradstreet's Weekly Review
States That Conditions
Are Generally Favorable
NEW YORK, Dec. 2.â Dun's weekly
review of trade to-morrow will say:
Holiday goods are moving: freely, and
in staple lines there is more activity,
even the products . that are between
seasons finding a fair market. Packing
and shipping departments are increas
ing forces and traffic congestion at sev
eral points indicates that the growth of
business has overtaxed railway facili-
I ties. Earnings of all roads reporting
for November show an average gain of
7.1 per cent over last year.
Weather conditions 1 have favored job
bing and enabled distribution of heavy
apparel and also accelerated
the marketing of new corn, but there
is not sufficient moisture for winter
wheat or coke production. A record
breaking yield of cotton is bringing
prices nearer the point at which normal
I consumption may be resumed, although
there is still much idle machinery at
Fall River.
, Other manufacturing news is most
gratifying. Structural work increases
and car shops are crowded with orders,
while manv idle steel mills have re
sumed.
Foreign commerce at this port for the
last week shows an increase of $2,304;
398 in value of imports as compared
with last year, and a loss of 52,035,171
in exports.
Increased offerings of native steers
at 14 cents by Chicago packers tend to
weaken the tone of the hide market,
although branded varieties were firmly
held and a large advance occurred in
foreign dry hides. Leather is stronger,
with a better movement of sole, and all
upper leather Is higher except glazed
kid. A most sensational advance of 4
cents occurred in the local market for
calfskins.
Commercial failures this week in the
United States are 205, against 214 last
week and 217 last year; In Canada 29,
against 39 last week and 27 last year.
Bradstreet's to-morrow will say: De
velopments have been mainly favor
able. Cooler weather has helped retail
trade, stimulated reorders from Jobbers
and improved collections except in por
tions of the South, where holding of
cotton is ' reported. Heavy dry goods,
clothing, shoes, groceries and hardware
note relatively most activity. Holiday
trade was opened well and promises a
very large aggregate.
Breaks In raw material have tended
to unsettle cotton goods, including sell
ers toward conservatism, and prints
have been "reduced at leading markets.
Failures are fewer in number and in
liabilities the lightest in any month but
one of 1904.

COLONEL SELLERS,
NOTED CHARACTER,
DIES AT RIALTO
LOS ANGELES, Dec 2.â Colonel
Lewis'" Henry Sellers, one of Mark
Twain's famous characters, died . last
night at Hotel Del Rialto at Rialto.
He was stricken suddenly, just after
bidding good-night to his friends and
family, with whom he had spent a

Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUBURN, Dec. 2.â The Grand Jury
is making headway very slowly, and it
probably will be some time next week
before it finishes examining witnesses
in the robbery and murder cases, in
which Adolph Weber is the defendant.
It is believed, however, that they will
bring in an -indictment for robbery
and one indictment for murder. It is
probable the jury will indict Weber
for the murder of his father. He is
now held on the charge of killing his
mother. : r Â»v. ?--:;.
. Lichtenstein, the Sacramento pawn
broker, was'in Auburn to-day and took
another look at the prisoner. He is
now positive that he sold Weber the
bank robber's pistol at his place of
business on May 17 last. The bank was
robbed May 26. Lichtenstein identified
the pistol, a 22-callber weapon, soon
after It was found under the brush on
the hillside below Auburn.' .*'
'The officers are very quiet just now,
and It is believed they have sufficient
evidence to convict young Weber on
both charges. They claim they have
â¢valuable testimony which will not be
made known until the trial. What the
prisoner's defense will be is hard to
tell. Weber himself intimates that he
will prove an alibi in both cases.
The accused boy laughs at the idea
that his plea will be insanity. Some
one remarked to him the other day
that if they were in his quarters very
long they would go crazy. Weber re
torted, "I'm not going to let myself go
crazy, never fear."
Weber still maintains his bold front.
His demeanor has changed but little
since his confinement. He is impudent,
sullen and defiant. His health is good.
He even looks better than he did a
week ago. He is less shifty and ner
vous. He answers one's questions by
asking another. If your interrogations
do not suit him he curls up the corner
of his lip and grins. When he sleeps
or lies down in his hammock he al
ways draws the coverings over his
head. When awake he writes a good
deal and has promised Sheriff Keena
and Coroner Shepard to write a book
of his life. For a diversion he whistles
a good deal, principally at night. He
never sings or shrieks, as has been
claimed
Before answering a hard question or
doing anything by which he Imagines
he can be Injured he puts his face in
his hands and thinks a minute. The
other day. when Under Sheriff May
announced that he was wanted before
the Grand Jury, Weber deliberately
got up from where he was sittlnfc writ
ing a letter, went to his hammock, got
into it, pulled the clothes over his head
and remained silent for at least five
minutes. He then announced his read
iness to go.
In an interview with Coroner Shep
ard and in reply to the question if he
ever thought of the hereafter Weber
replied:
"I think a great deal more than any
one has any idea. Because I do not
cry people imagine I have no concep
tion of my. position." .
Weber has been humored too mucn
in jail, as he was at home: but from
now on he will be accorded rcant cour
tesy. To-day he attempted to .give
orders to Jailer Fulton. When Fulton
took his dinner to him on a tray Weber
said Impudently: "Take it into the
forward cell."
"Take it in yourself," said Fulton, as
he put the tray at the prisoner's feet.
Weber's guardian, John Adams, vis
ited his ward this morning. He brought
the boy a paper- covered book on palm
istry and several pictures cut out of
the daily papers. Weber wants all the
pictures that the newspapers have
published, particularly those of him
self. Sheriff Keena handed him one
the other day. Weber threw it away,
saying it looked like a death mask.
JURY'S VERDICT ACQUITS
COURT MARTIAL CONVICTS
TACOMA, Dec. t 2.â Northwest mili
tary circles are somewhat stirred over
the trial by a military court at Van
couver of Private Fred R. Stubbs after
he was recently tried at Tacoma on
the charge of murder and "-acquitted.
During the American Lake encamp
ment last July Stubbs while intoxicat
ed quarreled with and fatally shot Pri
vate "Tom" Vandiver. He pleaded self
defense and was acquitted In the Supe
rior Court. The military authorities then
took the matter up and brought Stubbs
before a military court at Vancouver
which found him guilty and sentenced
him to five years in prison and to be
dishonorably discharged from the
army.
-The military court was" 1 not satisfied
with Stubbs' acquittal here, fearing
such action would establish a precedent
that might cause members of the army
to value life too cheaply. Stubbs'
friends hope to obtain his release on a
writ of habeas corpus and again take
him before the State court. They con
tend that the military authorities had
no right to try him after he had been
acquitted by. the State court.

A spasm seemed to seize Mrs. Gilbert

taking cold baths every morning, but to
a person of her age the physicians say
this was too strenuous. Death was
due to cerebral apoplexy. The attack is

STARTS TO TOUR COUNTRY
Actress Assures the Management of
Her Good Health.
NEW YORK, Dec. 2. â Mrs. Gilbert
was the star of the play "Granny,"
written for her by Clyde Fitch. The
company was organized by Charles
Frohman and was put before the pub
he as a tribute to Mrs. Gilbert's long
career on the stage. Mrs. Gilbert
played "Granny" for three weeks in
this city and when she started to tour
the country it was the Intention to
present the play in every city where
she had played during her career and
at the conclusion of the long trip she
was to retire from the stage.
The ovation to Mrs. Gilbert upon
her appearance at New York at the
first night of the play was a remark
able and pathetic one and the old lady
was overcome by the warmth of her
greeting. Fears were entertained at
that time that Mrs. Gilbert was not
strong enough for the long tour, but
she assured the management of her
good health and the trip was started.

WINS I/ATTRELS ON TILE STAGE.
Success Crowns the Conscientious Ef
forts of Mrs. Gilbert.
Mrs. George Henry Gilbert was born
at Rochdale, Lancashire, England, Oc
tober 21, 1821. Her maiden name was
Anna Hartley. Her father was Henry
Hartley, a journalist, who died when
she was but 15 years of age and she
soon after entered upon the career in
which she was to become so beloved
and famous.
Mrs. Gilbert began as a ballet dancer
at the Ballet School of Her Majesty In
the Haymarket Theater. London, un
der the instruction of the great Tag
honi, taking minor parts In the theater
to pay for her lessons. .
She followed this line in London and
on Norwich circuits until 1849, when
she came to America with her hus
band, George Henry Gilbert, a well
known London ballet dancer of the
time, to whom she was married in
1646. Her husband died in 1863.
Mrs." Gilbert continued as a solo
dancer, achieving great success, espe
cially in "La Cigale." until 1S57, when
she decided that her forte lay in the
character of old woman and she at
once took up that line of playing.
From her first essay in that work
as Lady Creamly. in "The Serious
Family," down to the very 'last, she
played old woman parts with a finesse
and genuine sympathy never sur
psjssed by any actress on the,English
speaking stage. She was identified In
the public mind with the typical grand
dame, the gentle elderly spinster, the
grandmother and more especially the
mother-in-law of stagedom.
In 1869 Mrs. Gilbert joined Au
gustin Daly's company, with which she
remained until, his death In 1899.
Although Mrs. Gilbert was long
known to the public as one of "Daly's
Big Four" â the others being Ada Re
han, James Lewis and John Drew â
Daly was " not the one who first
brought her out In New York. He
only dlsctrrered her after Mrs. Woods
had brought her there from the West
Daly's death was a real bereave
ment to Mrs. Gilbert. His theater had
become her home 'and he her warm
friend for thirty years. She' accepted
an offer from Charles ' Frohman and
began a new chapter in her long. life
story. She Joined Annie Ruesell, who
was then playing "Miss Hobbs." and
continued with the little "star until
quite â¢ lately, winning warm love and
affection wherever and to whatever
she appeared. -V
In. 1901 Mrs. Gilbert published her
"Reminiscences," which ' ' " attracted
widespread , attention, ' not â  onlyj on' ac
count of the beloved authoress herself,'
but for the value of "dramatic history ;

learn just what these "Incidentals"
might be, .-they joined in the hearty
laugh.
Some idea of the enormous prolits
accruing to ' this gambling-house was
gained by the translation of a few
pages from another book showing the
daily income. As the interpreter had
unfortunately left his duplicate calen
dar at home he could not reconcile the
Chinese dates with the American cal
endar, so it was impossible to make a
comparison as to the profits while the
injunction preventing police interfer
ence was in force and the earnings
after it was dissolved. The earnings
vary from $635 per day to $35. In all
the long list of dates read oft* the club
lost money but three times. On one
occasion it came out $290 -to the bad.
on another $95 and another $65. To off
set this here are a few items of daily
profit taken in rotation: $470. $365. $360.
$65. $3S3. $245. $635, $35, $230. $320. $400.
$215, $90 and $120. The interpreter
promises to bring bis calendar with
him to-day that comparisons can be
made. The amount of the daily earn
ings in a single club came as a surprise
to every one. ,
The names of R. A. Crothersand
Fremont Older were then called and
Attorney HIckey arose to announce
that they were not present and would
not be present, but that he represented
them. He objected to the form of sub
pena and questioned the right of the
Commissioners to Issue it. His clients
also stayed away for two other rea
sons, he said. In the first place, Com
missioner Hutton had proved the
charges that gambling was being car
ried on in Chinatown and, in the sec
ond place, as the names of Commis
sioners had been coupled with a cor
ruption fund it would be ridiculous to
present the charges before them and
have them sit as judges of their own
case. He deemed the paper served
merely a request, which request his
clients declined to comply with.
This gave Ruef the opening he had
been seeking and in one of the most
scathing speeches ever heard before
thÂ»Â» Commissioners he denounced the
two newspaper men, not only condemn
ing them for failure to appear, but also
attacking their characters.
RUEF IS EMPHATIC
"This paper was not a mere request,"
he said, "but a subpena in proper form,
and it does not lie with them whether
they shall come here or not. They are
afraid to come.- They have the priv
ilege of hiding behind a defense which
permits them to blacken other people
by innuendo. They are malicious liars,
libelers and cowards and I defy them
to come forward with one scintilla of
evidence to prove the charges they
have made are true
"They have attacked the Mayor, but
he will make no excuse. He stands
ready to meet them and will not skulk
behind a technicality, as these curs are
doing. I do not want to investigate the
Bulletin, as its editors have said, but
as they alone seem, to know who is
profiting by the alleged wrongdoing
they should be only too willing to come
here and tell even without beink asked.
I move you now that warrants be is
sued for their arrest for contempt.
Possibly a night in jail might teach
them that It is not wise to attack men
far and away their superiors." -
Attorney Hickey objected to the per
sonal tone of Ruef's remarks and said
that the board should not in decency
sit in Judgment on Itself.
This aroused Drinkhouse, who quer
ied excitedly, "Do you mean to say
that if evidence of bribery were
brought before this board we would
not listen to it?" Hickey said he be
lieved the board would, but did not
think It the "proper tribunal to hear
such a case." .
"What is the proper tribunal? asked
Ruef.
"You km>w as well as I do, was the
retort. â¢ _ '
"Well, I'll make a straight offer to
you," said Ruef. "Let the Bulletin
put In plain language, without guard
ing it by legal technicalities, the
charges it has made in a covered way,
print them to-morrow night and in
twenty minutes I will have a warrant
out for their arrest on a charge of libel
and they can select any Judge they
may choose to try the case."
The debate was becoming somewhat
heated when Commissioner Howell
poured a little oil on the troubled
waters. He advised Hickey to see that
Older and Crothers appeared before the
Commissioners at 2 o'clock this after
noon, otherwise citations would be is
sued for their arrest. - - ,,.
An adjournment until the hour
named was then taken. ,
CHINATOWN WELL. WATCHED.
Chinatown is now completely under
police control and no effort has been
made to open any of the gambling
houses since . they were closed two
nights ago. All doors are barred,

CZAR GIVING UP HOPE OF
HOLDING PORT ARTHUR
FALL OF FORTRESS NOW EXPECTED
Brave Stoessel May
Be Ordered to
Surrender.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 2.â With
the confirmation of the news that the
Japanese have occupied 203-Meter Hill
and the reports that the Russians
unsuccessfully attempted its recapture,
officials at the War Office are beginning
to prepare themselves for the inevit
able. Golden Hill and Liaoti Hill are
higher and dominate 203-Meter Hill,
but the officials say that if the Jap
anese succeed in mounting heavy guns
upon the latter it probably will be
only a question of days or weeks be
fore the fortress falls. Still there is
not the slightest idea among General
Stoessel's friends that he will surren
der, even if he should be ordered to do
so. ''It is hinted that it is possible that
if the fall of the fortress is shown to
be inevitable the Emperor may direct
its surrender in order to prevent the
unnecessary sacrifice of the remnant
of its brave defenders; but it is be
lieved by those who know General
Stoessel best that he will make good
his threat to hold out to the last man
and last cartridge in Port Arthur.
The ships in the harbor, it can now
be stated on high authority, are in no
condition to attempt to break through
the investing squadron. The guns of
the warships were long ago landed,
and the marines and sailors have been
participating in the land defense. Some
of the ships also have been injured by
shells. , If the fortress falls it is un

Japanese Detachment Withdraws as
:>â¢ Slav. Infantry Approaches.
TOKIO, Dec. 2. â The following re
port has been received from the com
mander of the Japanese troops at
Sienchuang, Manchuria:
"On November 25 a detachment of
our force attacked the position of the
enermy at Fuchialotu and dislodged
it. but on discovering that a large
column of the enemy was advancing
from the rear our detachment stopped
and occupied Machiacheng and vi
cinity.
"In the forenoon of the 26th some
artillery appeared in the direction of
Sanchiatzu and Wanliu. In the after
noon the enemy was gradually rein
forced /from the rear by from three
to four battalions of infantry and eight
guns. Our detachment avoided an en
gagement and rejoined the main posi
tion."
BOLD CRIMES
OF TWO THUGS
Hold Up Owner of Eoadside
House and Traveler Who
Drives Up to the Resort
CHICO. Dec. 2.â Two bold robberies
took place at what is known as the
Ten-Mile House yesterday. Two men
entered the small store conducted there
by John Hollenbeck, a man more than
70 years of age, held him up at the
point of a revolver and relieved him of
his cash. They then tied the old man
up, laid him upon the floor and said,
"We are going to hitch up your horse
and drive to Chico. Do not worry about
the rig. You will find the horse and
buggy at the Chico livery stable."
While the robbers were in the barn
James Garland drove \ up. He was
promptly robbed, as was the old man,
securely bound and laid beside s him
upon the floor. The two men then took
Garland's horse and buggy and started
for Chico.
Garland managed to get loose. He re
leased Hollenbeck and drove to China
svritch, several miles distant, from
where he telephoned to Chico for of
ficers. The officers started for the scene
of the double robbery and when Just
outside the city limits came upon Gar
land's rig. It had. been abandoned by
the robbers. The entire country was
searched, but no trace was found of the
robbers. The officers have but a poor
description of the bandits.

Lively Cannonading
in Progress Near
Mukden.
MUKDEN, Dec. 2.â From 2:30 o'clock
this afternoon until late to-night
sounds of a rapid cannonade have been
heard on the Russian southwest front,
such as has not been experienced for a
long time, but no excitement has been
caused by the increase in noise. Gen
eral Rennenkampff, with his cavalry,
is following the retreating Japanese,
giving them no time to occupy a posi
tion. It seems that the Japanese, in
attempting to seize Russian positions,
so extended themselves as to deplete
their reserves. ,
Opinion is divided still as to the
prospects of another big battle before
spring. The report was circulated last
week that if the Japanese made no at
tack by a certain date General Kuro
patkin would" take the offensive. This
date has passed . and still there Is no
sign of a movement on the part of the
Russians who are establishing them
selves in quarters that will answer for
the winter, and accumulating large
supplies^ of food. Fighting continues
on both flanks of the Russian army.
General Rennenkampff 's command be
ing heavily engaged. There is also
brisk artillery firing on the Russian
right and center.
Slejje. Artillery Begins Bombardment.
MUKDEN, Dec. 2, via Peking," Dec.
3.â The Russian siege artillery began a
bombardment at noon In the region
of the railway below Schiatun, a sta
tion near Shakhe. The bombardment
was continued heavily throughout the
afternoon. A large train of sick and
wounded, part of whom were.wound
ed in a recent small fight on the east
flank, went north yesterday, indicating
that the Russians were preparing for
imminent casualties. . ,
Drive Japanese Out of Entrenchment.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 2. â Gen
eral Sakharoff reports that a Russian
reconnoitering force attacked the Jap
anese who were entrenched at Lama
turn (Lamatlng) at nightfall on No
vember 30 and drove them out at the
point of the bayonet, pursuing them as
far as the Shakhe River. About twen
ty-five Japanese were bayoneted. The
Russians secured many rifles \and
equipments. The Russians obtained
a similar success on the right wing.
Russian Warships Pass Perim.
ISLAND OF PERIM, Strait . of
Bab-el-Mandeb, Dec. 2.â Twenty Rus
sian warships passed Perlm to-day,
going southward. They stopped an
hour off the African coast and then
proceeded toward Aden.
TANGIER, Dec. 2.â The Russian
auxiliary cruiser Rion, formerly the
Smolensk, and two torpedo-boat de
stroyers have arrived here and- are
coaling. The offl*cers say they expect
to sail to-morrow. *
Slavs Take Japanese Position.
ST. PETERSBURG,, Dec. 2. â Dis
patches received from Mukden, to-day
say that General Rennenkampft's force
on November 30 drove the Japanese
out of a new position southward of
Tsinkhetchen. The fighting was short
and sharp. The Japanese burned
their supply depots in three villages
and retreated, pursued by Cossacks to
the Taitse River. The Japanese lost
fifty killed and 100 wounded.
Manchurian Second Army Arrives.
LONDON, Dec. 3. â TheDally Tele
graph's Harbin correspondent, under
date'of December 2, says: "The greater
part of the Manchurian second army
has already arrived. It is in splendid
condition. General Grippenberg is ex
pected to-morrow, en route to the
front."
Japanese Announce Fatalities.
TOKIO, Dec. 2.â The Imperial

that seventeen officers have been killed
and sixty-four wounded in' the field,
but does not mention the place. "It is
presumed that it was at Port Arthur.

ST. PETERSBURG. Dec. 2.â Prince
Svlatopolk-Mirsky to-day received a
deputation of "Zionists. He informed
them that he sympathized with the
move they represented and would
withdraw the Government's opposition.
In the course of time the oldest in
habitant becomes a survivor.
Guns and Rifles Are
Taken From Foe by
Rennenkampff
, ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 3.â A spe
cial dispatch received here from Muk
den says:
"It is rumored that General Rennen
kampff has captured several Japanese
guns and a convoy with 600 rifles, but
that a force of 40,000 consisting of Chi
nese bandits and a reserve of 8900
Japanese has started to turn Rennen
kampff's flank."
Other advices announce that Gen
eral Rennenkampff has hotly pursued
a Japanese detachment below Sintsln
tin as far as the Taitse River and on
the right Russian scouts have ex
plored the Hun River below Liaoyang.
All the passes fell into Rennenkampft's
hands. The Japanese apparently failed
to show their old-time form, and offi
cial as well as unofficial dispatches in
dicate that the edge has been taken
off the Japanese fighting capabilities
by the cold weather.
There was a heavy bombardment to
day along the Russian center and
right which might indicate that Gen
eral Kuropatkin is preparing to as
sume the offensive. â¢
Among some of the best informed
officers a suspicion exists that Field
Marshal Oyama is trying to. work
Kuroki around east of Sintsintin with
a view to striking the Russians above
Tie Pass with the object of again try
ing a decisive coup, but no positive
evidence of such a move has yet ap
peared. Reports the last few days in
dicate that General Rennenkampff is
hotly following up the Japanese re
treat, meeting with comparatively lit
tle resistance, but some fear is ex
pressed that he may be running into a
Japanese trap formed with the hope of
cutting off his command. It is believed
he cannot possibly hold a position as
far south as the Taitze River.
CHINESE EDITOR ON THE WAR.
Xsr Poon Chew Gives Opinion of Rus
sian nnd Japanese Governments.
Ng Poon Chew, managing editor of
the Chung Sai Yat Po, the Chinese
daily paper of this city, spoke before
the members of the British and
American Union in the Academy of-
Sciences Hall last nisht on "The Far
Eastern Crisis â Its Cause and Effect
in Relation to China.'' The hall was
crowded and was profusely decorated
with the American and British flags.
President d'Evelyn presided.
The speaker defended Japan in her
course in the Dresent war with Rus
sia and said in part:
Maybe. Japan may be considered pagan, but
it is in name only. She Is Christian as com
pared to Russia. The Japanese Government Is
honest, her statesmen are not corrupt; indeed,
corruption is umfreamed cf by those who con
duct the Japanese Government. Can the same
be said of Russia? So. There It is different.
Japanese statesmen strive ror the good will
and have " the confidence of the people. The
Mikado himself stands for tbe political freedom
of all his subjects.
â¢ Russia has Ions claimed to be the apostle of
Christianity, yet look at and consider the
shameful persecution of the Jews In the city
of Kishinef, -where men, women and children,
aye, and babes, were crying qut for mercy.
These pitiful cries were heard all the world
round and the streets are stained with the
blood of the massacred, and still Russia tell*
us she Is Christian.
- During the- history of Russia's occupancy of
Manchuria the cruelty of her Cossacks toward
the natives is known. Those representatives
were sent by Russia, the apostle ot Christiani
ty. , Rather say the apostle of cruelty, the
scourge and damnation.
As for China, there will be no peace until a
better government shall exist there, a govern
ment for the people and by the people. But
the Japanese-Russian war will work wonders
for China, because It will wake her up and
she will think, and that will be something new.
Her thinking apparatus has got out of gear,
but this war will send a thrill through her
whole system and she will wake. China, with
her 450,000,000. could not dare do what Japan,
with her 42,000,000, has dared to do In her re
sistance against Russian aggression. -
But China will eventually be a great and
grand nation and will enjoy her heritage. She
has a grand future, a future of prosperity, for
they are not all fossils and old fogies there, as
is sometimes thought.
Dr. d'Evelyn announced that a
meeting of the. Pacific Coast branch
of the American conference on Inter
national arbitration with Great Brat
ain and the other powers will be held
next Monday evening at Temple
Emanu-El. Dr. d'Evelyn said that
the British and American Union of
San Francisco was the first body or
ganized for the " pacific purpose of
creating and fostering that sentiment
and which declared' in its preamble
its object to harmonize all relation
ships between the two peoples.
The other factors which have since
created much of the sentiment looking
toward arbitration, said the doctor,
are the Pilgrims' Club of London, the
Atlantic Union of New York and the
Transatlantic of Philadelphia.

Mr. Castiglionis' doubt abruptly van
ished. "Mamma, hey?" he Inquired,
i surveying the portrait with unfavorable
eye. "And how much am I expected to
pay for mamma?"
Ere the picture dealer could answer
Mrs. Castiglionis, with illy concealed
trepidation, twittered: "Oh, it's too

"How much?" implacably repeated
Mr. Castiglionis.
"Six dollars and a half," said the

"Take it away before I break it," said
Mr. Castiglionis, stretching forth a
menacing hand.
â¢-"Touch It if you dare, you stingy
brute!" shouted Mrs. Caetiglionis,
grasping the picture.
"Your mamma, indeed!" yelled Mr.
Castiglionis, seizing the fragile thing,
wrenching it from the lady's clutch and
plunging one of his heavily booted feet
through it. . "Mamma, indeed! That's
what I'll do with mamma's likeness,
and would like to do with mamma her
self!" And he hurled the demolished
portrait out of doors.
Police Judge Conlan, before whom
Mr. Castiglionis was accused of mali
cious mischief by the picture dealer,
LÂ». Shenker, proposed a compromlsee,
but it. was mutually rejected. The de
fendant claimed that Intrinsically the
picture wasn't worth 50 cents, and he
wouldn't take that number of dollars
and allow it to be added to his art col
lection. Mr. Shenker, on the other
hand, declared that the frame alone
was cheap at the price he asked for the
entire outfit, and he couldn't think of
accepting one cent less than that price.
"Then," said his Honor, "I must dis
miss the case."

Pat Hogan's^ monthly pay day is al
ways hailed with unction, by the fun-,
loving folk resident of the vicinage of
Twenty-second and Kentucky streets,
for Pat Hogan spends a ' considerable
portion of his., salary for ardent spirits
and when under their influence is a
source of Innocent merriment for the
neighborhood. , He is naturally of jocose
temperament, and even while dead sob
er can always be depended upon to say
or do something funny; but when his
inherent humor Is enhanced by liquid
stimulation, no circus clown can equal
him. His employers, a firm of contrac
tors, have become so accustomed to his
infinity of jest that they no longer
consider it derogatory to his usefulness
as a laborer, and his monthly absences
from toil are accepted as a matter of
course. No other man on their pay roll
could do as Pat Hogan does and retain
his job a second month.
Mr. Hogan's periodical lapse occurred
Thursday, when he received his hire
for November, and the- capers he In
dulged in kept the neighborhood in an
alternation of chuckles and screams
until Patrolman McAuliffe, whose sense
of the ludicrous is not of the keenest,
spoiled the fun by running him In.
Completely to enumerate the defend
ant's comicalities, as they were re-
counted by the policeman to Judge Mo
gan, would be an unwarranted trespass
upon space. Suffice it to say that he
cut pigeon wings, pranced- cakewalks,
turned . somersaults, sang ."come-all
yes," gave Imitations . of . various ani
mals and birds and incidentally spent
his hard-earned money, with the free
dom â  of " a drunken sailor.. It was to
save several feminine spectators from
threatened side-splitting, the policeman
averred, that he hastened Mr, Hogan to
prison:
Hogan's dismissal is likely to be his
sentence to-day.

Consideration of this bill was not
reached until the evening session. In
the morning Chief Justice Beatty, act
ing as president of the association, read
an annual report, in which he reiterated
his statements of last year to the ef
fect that, referring to the failure In the
Legislature of what is known as "the
Works bill," he "never considered any
radical change in existing laws regu
lating the acquisition and use of water
rights essential to the attainment of the
main objects of this association." Jus
tice Beatty also reviewed the transac
tions of the year/ and said that he was
'.'happy to fe,el assured that there is no
abatement of public interest and no
Jealousy or opposition to the efforts- we
are making." He further said:
The laws enacted and proposed for the pur
pose of averting the denudation of our forests
are the result of a strongly aroused public
sentiment and the general conviction of all
who have seriously considered the subject is that
the policy Is wise and of vital importance and
insures popular support of legislation of the
character which, in the more highly civilised
countrl*^ of the world, has proved that forests
may net only be preserved, but extended at
the same time that they are yielding a hand
sonve profit to those who have been instructed
In the science of forestry.
Xo new Dlan of the revision of laws govern
ing the acquisition and exercise of water rights
has been formulated and published. Therefore
there is nothing to be laid before the conven
tion except the expediency of again presenting
the Works bill In Its original or in some modi
fied form. My own opinion, as you are aware.
Is that it is not the true policy of this asÂ«o
ciatlon to rnfrage in any effort . to revise the
water laws of the State. . What is most urgent
ly needed Is thorough Investigation of existing
and natural conditions in order to obtain the

E. A. Sterling of the Bureau of For- |
;stry" read a paper on the subject of
The Place af Lumbering in California
Forestry." He said that protection of
the forests against fire is the greatest
requirement." Second only to flre pro
tection and dependent upon applied
measures of fire protection is the util
ization uf the forest resources, in other
words the cutting over of timber lands
in such a manner as not to destroy the
future forest-producing power of the
land, open It up to erosion and destroy
its water retaining capacity or cause
It to revert to worthless chaparral..
Sterling spoke about the forest re
serves in this State that aggregate near
ly 9,000,000 acres. The greater part of
California's timber lands la In the
hands of Individuals and corporations,
he said, who can and will utilize it for
their own interests. Concerning this
phase of the situation Sterling said in
jart:
I want to make particularly strong the point
hat the State should not, stand idly by and
lepend on what the National Government has
lone and will do to save the State's forest*.

from 20,000 to 100.000 acres. .Imagine the

are cut over and burned until the lands now
forested are bare or chaparral covered, whether

prices you rauat pay for lumber, the outcome
along any of these lines will be mightily af

W. C. Hodge Jr. of the Bureau of
Forestry read a report In which he sug
gested a working plan under the co
operation of the State and of the
United States in California. Some of
his suggestions were as follows:
- Reclamation of existing chaparral to consist
of experiments for restoring the forest by care,
ful burning of the brush, followed by plant
ing of seeds or seedlings; protection of forest
areaa from flre in order to prevent an increase
in the chaparral and give opportunity for the
natural return of the forests. These results
would be obtained by careful burning of
"slash" left after lumbering and the prepara
tion of detailed plans of flre protection suited
to the local conditions on limited tracts. Ap
plication of lumbering methods, which will
Insure a future growth of timber instead of
chaparral.' Under this head, plans of man
agement for representative tracts would be
prepared. The result of such a series of ex
periments would be of enormous value to the
Professor Samuel Fortler of the Uni
versity of Californla,connected with the
irrigation and drainage investigations
of the State's Department of Agricul
ture, who is in charge of the co-opera
tive irrigation investigations in" Califor
nia, read a long report in which he con
sidered from a practical standpoint the
pumping plants of the State, the duty
of water under pumping plants, the
value of water in fruit growing, the
evaporation from a water surface and
the relation of .soil moisture to. plant
growth.. A part of his. paper is as fol-
lows : . r
In. portions of California which receive more
than fifteen inches of. rainfall in. a year opin
ions of : - orchardists differ as to . the value of
irrigation in their industry. In regard to this
we have obtained testimony from a large num
ber of lrri gators throughout the Pacific .Coast
States. As to the general results it may be
said that they are decidedly in favor of the
value of irrigation. The - first Inquiry was
with reference to the quantity of the product
as affected by irrigation, and the testimony
of over 200 experienced men went to show
that the increase due to a supplementary
water supply by irrigation varied from 10 to
100 per cent
The second inquiry was whether irrigratlon
increased the regularity of bearing. Of the
opinions received about 00 per cent were fa
vorable to Irrigation and 10 per cent were
doubtful
The third Inquiry was with reference to the
general qualities and commercial characters of
irrigated fruit. The numerical result was that
eighty-seven growers maintained the superior-
ity of irrigated fruit.
The effect of water on the yield of cereals
on the worn out soils of the San Joaquln Val
ley 1b being tried. In experimenting with
barley last winter the natural rainfall, which
amounted to four and a half inches during
the period of growth, produced at the rate of
nine bushels per acre, while the application of
sixteen inches of water increased the yield to
twenty-two bushels per acre. In the case of
wheat, the rainfall produced straw but no
grain, four inches of water produced a yield at
the rate of ten bushels, and sixteen Inches of
water increased the yield to thirty-eight bush-
els pÂ«r acre

SMART SET MAID.
MRS. ELEANOR HARTIM IS
HOSTESS AT FUNCTION
W/cuvm Welcome to Debutante
v Bj- Sally Sharp.
*Toath! To-Jth! Hew buoyant are thy hopes!
â¢â¢. They turn.
I^k* njartgciaa. toward the sunny aide."
Buoraat in good truth was youth last
night, as thÂ« smart set dropped its
lowest curtsy in honor of the fair
â  youns daughter of the house of Har
vey.
' Xot in the mesnory of a score of sea
- soa has there been so brilliant a com
ing-out function aa the ball given at
the St. Francis last night in honor of
Miss Anita Harvey, daughter of Mr.
.' end Mi-s, J. Downey Harvey. In fit
ting: fashion was the stunning maid
presented to the smart folk of the West
â¢by her grandmother, Mrs. Eleanor
â¢Ivlartln, whese entertainments have,
4n years past, been synonyms for
splendid hospitality.
T.he maid who last night was formal
ly -initiated into the world of elysian
pleasures is well fortified for the con
spicuous position which shall hence
fcirth be hers. . Thrice lucky maiden,
â who bath thus been blessed by nature
and her handmaidens with all the
-&Afts the fickle dames doth hold!
The. ball was the joyful baptism of
the white and gold ballroom, and the
scene in the mirrored palace will live
i long in the annals of the smart set
:f unctlcns.
The guests were received in the
' Louis XVT drawing-room, which was
graced with white chrysanthemums in
:. great vases. From the draped entrance
the beauty of the ballroom, with its
Ivory â¢ walls pecked out in gold; its
great crystal globes ablaze with light,
reflecting the exquisite glimmerings of
'a summer rainbow; the mirrored pan
els catching the hundreds of beautiful
proxnen as they passed to and fro: the
1-enk-s of American Beauty roses piled
â¢ in prodis-al profusion in jars on the
.jnSiitel shelf; the forest of ferns, glis
tening magnolias, palms and wood
ward i.as, caught and given back by the
; filvered panels get in the walls of
Ivory.
' Round about the ballroom crimson
' rsatin divans beckoned the weary
rlancer or the patient chaperon, while
fr^m v.ir.dow, balcony and doorway
."Â«-r'^ison satin hangings fell in soft
1 usury,
'â¢'. Scfeened from the curious by Orien
tal Screens â and there are few curious
' folk round aboutâ the west wing of the
hotel,' with the mezzanine floor, became
.a tropic garden.
- Or. the stairway to the mezzanine
floor/and in the ladies' gallery great
. vases filled with huckleberry stood
'. about, flanked by ferns and towering
jiajras. â¢â¢; ' tfNW
- From the balcony overlooking the
â  .ballroom the vision was dazzling, for
from the heights only could the full
â¢ beauty of the scene be appreciated,
- wUh its scores of beautiful maids and
matrons and smart men on pleasure
; bent." -.' â¢ . : : ! i
â \ And the floor! Ah! here indeed was
â¢a Joy! 'Twas not unlike the smooth.
' surface of a pond in winter
â¢.ti-rrie, icebound, without a flaw.
â  The da-ncers â the feminine part â
â¢came shockingly late, leaving bunches
and bunches of men standing about in
â¢ dismal expectancy.
â¢ At midnight an elaborate supper was
served, in the grill, where American
â¢ Beauty roses graced each table.
;. .After the feast on went the dance
more merrily than before, bringing to
" a. brilliant close the most Elaborate
1 debutante function of the winter of
â¢ 1904â a" winter distinctive for gay af
â¢ fairs.. ; ,.â¢â  ' . ',-..;.. :
â¢ .Among the smartly gowned women
' were Mrs. Eteanor Martin, in a white
satin gown with geld trimming, while
' Mrs. Walter H. Martin's gown was of
blue Fpangled net over blue chiffon.

wounded Mrs. Frances Fox, her friend.
The shooting took place at 214 East

family. To-night Marcoux secreted
himself in the rear of the Fox house
and when Mrs. Marcoux and Mrs. Fox
came out he opened flre from a re
volver. The first shot missed Mrs.

to shoot. The second shot passed
through her heart, killing her instant
ly. Marcoux then turned the weapon
upon Mrs. Fox and shot her through
the stomach. She is believed to be
fatally wounded.
The murderer, fled, but was arrested

CHILD BURNED TO DEATH
DURING MOTHER'S ABSENCE
Clothing of Boy Catches Fire From
Heater in Room Where He
Was Playing.
REDDING, Dec. 2.â Durfee Lone,
one of the twin sons of J. C. Long of
Fall River Mills, was burned to death
at the home of his parents to-day.
The little fellow was not quite 3 years
of age. It is presumed that the boy's
clothing took flre from a heater in the
room in which he was playing.
The accident occurred while the
boy's mother was drawing a pail of
water from a well across the street.
On her return she found her son in
the center of the room with all the
clothing, with the exception of the
neckband of his dress, burned from
his body. Though the child was so
frightfully burned that the flesh
dronped from his body as the agonized
mother lifted him from the floor, he
lived four hours.

CAVALIER GIVES
UP HIS OFFICE
Manager of Student Paper
at University Steps Out
of a Profitable Place
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call.
2148 Center Street, Dec. 2.
According to programme, Harry
Lcveland was to-day elected manager
of the Daily Californian, the univer
sity news publication, at a meeting of
the Ftockholders held this afternoon in
Ftfles Hall. He succeeds William
Cavalier, who has resigned the posi
tion.
Joseph Loeb was cho^jn to take the*
place of W. T. Hale, formerly edi
tor In chief of the paper. The elec
tion of . each was practically decided
upon by the stockholders: yesterday.
Mr. Cavalier made his report for the
term, which is almost ended, his state
ments showing that unusual pros
perity has been enjoyed by the Cali
fornian this year.
It. has been rumored that Cavalier
resigned the position because of the
action of the authorities in deposing
W. T. Hale, who was beloved of his
elapsmen. Cavalier denies this, saying
that, duties which are unavoidable
make it necessary for him to relin
quish the position he has filled since
the present term begun.
Under Cavalier's direction the Cali
fornia n has cleared a handsome profit.
rreaxfy J^*>o more than has been made
in a similar period heretofore. The
profits are divided as follows: Man
ager. ZO p^r cent; editor in chief. 30
per cent; manager editor. 10 per cent;
stockholders. 10 per cent.
Although Loeb is -now editor in
chief, he will not assume the duties of
that office until next term, hence there
will be no editorials printed until
Loeb assumes formal oharge.
Manager Cavalier reported the gross
receipts of the Californian during this
term to November 14 to be $2391 90;
exr>ensr>s.}$171Â£ 55: net profit, 5673 35.
The net receipts for the~term will
be about $900. The net receipts last
ttrm under Eupene Hallett's manage
ment were S640. The printing bill this
t*rm was $300 more than last, the pa
per having been enlarged.

CANNOT FIND
MEN TO SWEAR
Prosecuting Attorney Ex
plains to Police Board
Why Patrolmen Go Free
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Dec. 2.
Because of his inability to get any
one to swear to complaints against the
four policemen who were dismissed
from the Police Department for thiev
ing. Prosecuting Attorney A. P.
\ Leach's hands have been tied in the
i matter of a criminal prosecution of the
men. The Police and Fire Commission
ers to-day received a letter from Leach
j in which he said he had be'fen unable to
j persuade any of the, merchants to
; swear to the complaints. The two po
licemen who saw the actions that cast
suspicion on the quartet will not make
oath to charges of burglary.
Leach's letter reads as follows:
I beg leave to acknowledge receipt of copies
of each of the two resolutions paRned by your
honorable body with reference to the prosecu
tion of the four police officers heretofore 1 dis
charged from the police force of this city by
you for dishonesty. I ha\-e. in compliance
with the intent thereof, had a good many
consultations with the Chief of Police and haw
heen told by him what the evidence In hie
hands was. Immediately upon being Informed
of the contents of your resolutions of Novem
ber IS.. I prepared complaints charging each
of sÂ«ai<l officers with the crime of burglary and

DEATH SUMMONS
ZACH T. GILPIN
Former City Treasurer of
Oakland Dies at Coif ax
After a Short Illness
. / .
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Dec. 2.
Zachary T. Gilpin, who for fourteen
years was City Treasurer of Oakland,
died yesterday at Col fax, Placer Coun
ty, where he went last July hoping to
improve his health, which had been
failing for some time.
Mr. Gilpin was one of the best known
of the pioneer residents of Oakland. He
had lived here since 1877. He first came
to California with his parents, who
crossed the plains in 1849. He was edu
cated at the old college in Oakland,
which later became the University of
California. After completing his course
at college he removed to Nevada, where
he served as deputy county recorder of
Lyon County, and- was later elected to
the office of County Recorder, which he
filled for two years,
Mr. Gilpin was for six years a mem
ber of the firm of Babbitt, Manuel &
Gilpin, commission merchants. In 1878
he married Mary Babbitt,. the daughter
of his partner. In 1884 he was appoint
ed deputy city treasurer by G. M. Fish
er, and in 1889 was himself elected to
the office of City Treasurer.
Aftf-r his retirement from politii.il
life Gilpin established the Standard
Wood Company. George W. Johnson
was his partnn- in the venture, but the
business failed to pay as well as was
expected, and Gilpm's financial affairs
became badly tangled, the trouble final
ly culminating in the filing of Beveral
attachment? on the property of the
company and on property owned by
Gilpin and his wife. The first of these
attachments was filed on July 28, 1904,
by \V. E. Dean as the assignee of Dr.
W. H. Huntington, who brought suit to
collect on a note given by Gilpin for
$3600. On July 29 an attachment was
filed by H. Blais on a piece of property
owned by Mrs. Gilpin to recover on a
note for $1500 signed by Gilpin. his wife.
George W. 1 Johnson and the wife of the
latter.
Shortly before these attachments
were filed Gilpin went to Colfax in an
effort to regain his health, but it is be
lieved that his financial trouble preyed
on his mind and prevented recovery.
The news Of his death was received
last night by his family from a man
named McDonald, with whom Gilpin
had been associated ' in mining enter
prises. Mr. Gilpin was 57 years' of age
and leaves a. wife and one son, Lee Gil
pin. who reside at 1954 Webster street.
The son has gone to Colfax" to bring
the remains to this city for interment.

by Two Young Women Who
Were Passing.
OAKLAND, Dec. 2. â An ; attempt
made this evening by an unknown jn
cendiary Ito destroy the Clawson
School, at Thirty-fourth and Magnolia
streets, was frustrated in the nick of
time by two young women, who dis
covered the blaze just as it was lick
ing the woodwork of the school and
promptly extinguished it before ; any

The flj-ebug attempted to set fire to
the school from the outside bybuild
inp a fire 1 against the ' struc
ture and had . it ... remained un
discovered for a few moments more

hard to control. The light of" the
flames was seen, by the two women,
who were passing, and they at once
went to work to save the building.
After putting the fire out they re
ported the attempt to. destroy the
school to the firemen at the house Of

the police. The names ; of â¢ the' two
young women were not learned.

in Harmon Gymnasium.
Berkeley. Office San Francisco Call,
2US Center Street, Dec. \2.
In dramatic" fashion at the semi
monthly university/ meeting in Har

dent Benjamin Ide Wheeler declared
his belief in- the innocence of Adolph
Knopf, a graduate Btudent who â  * is
named as corespondent' in the. divorce
suit . recently brought, by Professor
Ross Van I-^orn of San Rafael. Knopf
has been in the limelight for two weeks
in Judge Ogden's court in Oakland
during the Van Horn divorce ' trial. VTtie,
court I on - last Wednesday gave Van
Horn the . decree he. prayed for, ap
parently giving credence to the hus
band's charge that Adolph Knopf had
been guilty of intimacy with Mrs. Van
Mrs. Van Horn was proprietor of a.
boarding-house at 2222 Bancroft way,
where many university students lived,
Knopf being among them. Van Horn
lived apart from his wife part -of the
time. He was formerly a school prin
cipal at San Rafael. "He suspected his
wife of unseemly conduct and swore in
court that he saw Knopf and Mrs. Van
Horn behave ; in an improper manner.
His witnesses testified that Knopf
had accompanied Mrs. Van Horn to a
lodging-house in Oakland at night. The
case was bitterly fo'ught,. with counter
charges and recrimination. The uni
versity folk took special interest in
the proceedings because several prom
inent students were on the witness

known In Berkeley. . ;
Knopf was called into President

The announcement was received in
silence, the students being unprepared
for it by any preliminary word from

Brings Suit Against Holders of Invalid
Mortgages to Make Them Show ,_.
-What Interests They Have.
OAKLAND, Dec. 2. â Suit to have
settled how far the buildings erected
upon his land constitute a lien against
it, was begun by James Irvine to-day
against "Warren G. Sahborn; Oscar G.
and .William G. May and others. The
defendants ' advanced loans, upon the
realty and accepted mortgages from
men who had no title to it and they
now allege that they have -an interest
in the property because their money
went into the houses built upon the
premises
The action grows out of a transac
tion whereby a man assuming to. be
the owner, of a block of land at
Dwight way and Choate street in
Berkeley sold it to,E. J. Shepardson
and his brother,. who in turn borrow
ed the money with which'to build the
houses: When the. real Irvine turned
up' they. deeded him the. land," but the
holders of the mortgage now have
nothing but a suit in equity as secur
ity for; their, money. Irvine, however,

Professor Soule Scores Man
Who Had Accused Him
of a Contemptible Deed
NAMES STEEL COMPANIES
Carnegie and Cambria Men
Figure in Story Told by
Instructor at University
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Dec. 2.
Bitterly resenting what he termed an
"underhanded attack upon his honor
and integrity," Professor Frank Soule,
head of the civil engineering depart
ment of the university, to-day treated
his class to an excoriation of a student,
name unknown, who has nought to put
Professor Soule in the light of a
"double-dealing grafter."
; Professor Soule's announcement !
created a sensation. He refused to re- i
veal the name of the student who had
so excited his wrath, contenting him
self with. saying that the offender is a
senior connected with the Engineering
College.
The Carnegie Steel Company and the
Cambria . Steel Company, giant cor
porations that are deadly rivals, figure
In the atory which Professor Soule
told to his class. Professor Soule a
few months ago secured from the
Cambria Company several hundred
books, dealing with problems in con
nection with steel material, paying
about 50 'cents â apiece for them, and
selling them to studenÂ£s, who sub
scribed for them at the professor's
suggestion. . * ,~\ -
Later Mr. Isaacs of the Carnegie
Company, hearing that Professor
Soule's students were paying for the
Cambria books about steel, sent to the
department here a quantity of the
Carnegie books for distribution gratis
among the junior class.
To his class to-day Professor Soule
said:
The co-operative store took charge of the
books and under my advice gave them only to
those who had shown enough interest in the
matter to subscribe to the Cambria books.
After all these had been supplied the books
were given to the members of the class who
applied for them, as was the Intention of the
donor.
A man In the senior class of mechanical en
gineering, who has no claim upon me or upon
the books, wrote to Mr. Isaacs of the Carnegie
company, accusing me of giving the books
only to those who would subscribe for the pub
lication of a rival steel company, the Cambria.
He accused me of dealing In a very con
temptible way with the firm, which was kind
enough to do me and the class a favor. He
wrote what was absolutely untrue and did it
without consulting me of 'giving mÂ« a chance
to state the true facts. Later, when I applied
to Mr. Isaacs for more books, the supply hav
ing proved inadequate. I waa told that no
more could be given this year.
'â  Gentlemen,' I resent, the action of this senior
i very keenly. He attacked my honor and has
put me in a false light. I resent It particu
larly because It was done behind my back.
There are 'six of the Carnegie books left, and
I shall leave their distribution to one who has
tackled several things successfully, including
the Stanford football teamâ James Force of
the varsity football team and this class. -
The class "gave three cheers for Pro
fessor Soule and the books in ques
tion were put Into the hands of O. M.
Boyle for distribution, Force- being
absent. '

front wheels off. The second shock
threw the plucky girl from the buggy
and she struck upon her head, frac
turing the skull. There are but slight
hopes for her recovery.

Awakened from sound sleep by the
glare of flames Captain E. F. Stan
nard of the ship Centennial, moored
in Session* Basin, off East Oakland.
leaped from his berth at 2:20 o'clock
yesterday morning to find himself
surrounded by fire. The flames filled
the cabin of the vessel with stifline
smoke, through which the captain
fought his way. to the door. Reaching
the deck he found the entire after Dart
of the ship on are. the flames having
already broken through the roof of the
cabin and deckhouse and reached the
lower epars and rigging.
Realizing that he could not cope with
the fire, the captain rang the ship's
bell to attract the attention of the
crews of other ships in the basin, and
then set about saving what he could
from his cabin. The fire had already
been seen and soon several boatloads
of men* boarded the vessel, but the
flames had too great a start and could
not bt extinguished with the means at
hand- As soon as the fire was seen
from the shore an alarm was sent to
the police station and Xight Captain
W- J. Petersen. knowing that the ship
could not be reached from the shore,
at once telephoned to San Francisco
for assistance.
The Epreckels tug Reliance. Captain
Downey, reached the burning ship
about 4 o'clock. The fire tug Gov
ernor Markham arrived a few minutes
later. Heavy streams of water soon
had the flames under control, and at 7
o"clock the fire was finally extinguished.
While the "fire was at Its heieht the
main and mizzen masts of the ship
crashed overboard, the former striking
the schooner Ida Schnauer. which was
moored close to the Centennial. The
latter was badly damaged and narrow
ly escaped being set on fire by the
blazing spars.
When the fire was first discovered it
had already got a good start. Its ori
gin is unknown, but Captain Stannard
thinks it was caused by rats carry Ins
matchf-s in the fishermen's auarters. In
pplte of the efforts of tho captain nearly
all the charts and instruments of the
?hip were lost.
The Centennial is owned by the
Alaska Packers' Association, and val
ued at $30,000. The vessel was an old
one. having been built in Massachu
setts thirty years ago. The owners es
timate the damage at $10,000, with no
insurance.

WILL RECLAIM
KLAMATH AREAS
Federal Engineers Planning
Vast Irrigation Project
on California-Oregon Line
TO SAVE 300,000 ACKES
Residents of Eegion Affect
ed Co-operating to Clear
Way for Government
" F. H. Newell, chief engineer of the
United States reclamation service; Mor
ris Bien, attorney; J. B. LJppincott, su
pervising engineer, and Thomas Neans,
soil expert, have Just arrived In the
city from a we.ek of Inspection of the
proposed irrigation system to be built
by the Federal Government in the basin
of the Klamath River. They have
driven about 300 miles In all In viewing
this project.
The basrrt of Klamath River Is in
Northern California and Southern Ore
gon, the State cutting the area in
two. The storage reservoirs will have
to be built in California for the irriga
tion of land in Oregon, and water will
also have to be stored In Oregon for
the Irrigation of land in California. In
addition the Klamath River is both in
terstate and navigable. It is proposed
to drain two large interstate lakes. In
terstate navigable waters are under^the
jurisdiction of the Federal Government.
This project therefore,, if it is to be
fully developed, becomes distinctly of a
I Federal character. Special legislation,
both Federal and State, is requisite for
this work.
Meetings were held at most of the
important towns in the district and a
unanimous sentiment was expressed by
the citizens and landowners for the
construction of this system by the
Federal Government. It is estimated
that in all about. 300,000 acres can be
reclaimed.
The , people are organizing, water
users' associations to contract with the
Government for the construction of the
plant. Preliminary arrangements are
being made by the settlers to. obtain
possession of the two existing canals
that are irrigating small areas in order
thaV the field may be entirely clear for
Federal operations. . .
â¢ AH the members of the party, includ
ing the chief engineer, expressed them
selves as delighted with the opportuni
ties offered for a great development in
that section, and the people were as
sured by them that the Federal Gov
ernment stood ready to construct the
works promptly provided suitable ad
justment could be made of the legal
difficulties attending the disposal of
canals that are now supplying water to
that section. The prospect appears fa
vorable for the accomplishment of this
purpose. . T. H. Humphreys, engineer of
the United States reclamation service,
has had several parties in the field since
June making surveys for the project.
His reports are entirely favorable.
Will Present German Play.

the Columbia Theater by the-Alameda

JAILBREAKER CAPTURED
AND IROX-SAW IS TOXJSTf
Santa Clara County Officer Arrests J,
D. Potter at Healdsburz and
Brings Him to This City.
Deputy Sheriff R. Starblrd of Santa
Clara County arrived In this city last
night, having In custody J. D. Potter,
wanted for Jailbreaking In San Jose.
Potter made his escape last Saturday
by sawing his way out of Jail and was
captured two days ago in Healdsburg.
Starbird was sent after him and when
the deputy sheriff went to the cell to
take out his prisoner yesterday after
noon he was much surprised to find
that Potter was back at his old tricks
again and had sawed one of the bars
loose. A fine iron-saw was found In
his possession. It had evidently beÂ«n
overlooked when he was searched. He*
was detained for the night In the local
City Prison. Potter was awaiting
transportation to San Quentln. where
he had been sentenced to serve five
years for highway robbery, when he
made his escape. Shortly before he
committed this crime he was released
from the same prison after having
served four years for forgery.

OAKLAND WATER.
THE renewed agitation of a municipal water plant in Oakland has
brought out much disct^skra in the press of that city. So far it
is confined to disputation over the rival claims of a ground water
and catchment supply. The judicial decisions respecting ground wa
ter and riparian ownership afford an interesting and necessary study
to any city that is looking for a supply above or below ground in any
place near the coast.
The need of water in agriculture and horticulture and the prior
appropriation of potable supplies have made it difficult to take water
anywhere without running the gauntlet of court decisions and prior
rights. The unclaimed supply lies more distant, and it may be ac
cepted as true that new plants must be sought farther away. Bir
mingham went far away to the Welsh hills for a municipal plant
after takrng over the private plant to get rid of competition. Glas
gow went to a high watershed where the rainfall exceeds fifty inches j
for a supply to add to the private plant which was first acquired.
While this part of the problem is important, yet the Oakland discus
sion so far is merely playing in the puddles of the water question
from the standpoint of municipal ownership. .-V ' .V -
The really grave problems are economic and administrative.
With enough money to get it a sufficient water supply can be had by
: going far enough for it anywhere in Northern California. The point
to be studied by the people of Oakland is the business aspect of the
-proposed venture. If a city go into municipal ownership it must, as
a business proposition, rid itself first of rivalry and competition. It
must be alone in the field. If it expect to have a proper administra
tion of such a plant when acquired it "must make the plant itself
carrv the cost of its creation and administration. The Call can ren
der no greater service to its readers than by persistently urging this, j
A municipal water plant is acquired for the benefit of the ratepayers,
the users of the water. Justice to them demands that they know just
what they are paying and that their water rate represent all that they
are paying. In this way alone can they be assured of a proper busi
ness administration of such a plant.
The politicians we are always to have with us and the ambitions i
.of men for the distinctions of public office will always endure. If j
the bonds for buying a water plant are a mortgage upon the city, j
resting upon the real and personal property of the taxpayers, and if â¢
the deficits in the revenues of the water plant may be charged off to j
the general fund, every election will produce candidates who seekj
votes by promising to lower the water rate, and they will get them j
and will be elected and in office they will keep their promise by low
cring the rate tothe ratepayer and charging the difference to him I
as a taxpayer. This is done wherever government ownership per- |
.mits it. It'is done on the state railways of Australia and Italy, and it '
is done in American cities where public utilities have been acquired, j
The rates paid for the use of railways or of water under such circum- j
stances do not represent the cost to the user, who cannot find out i
from his tax receipt how much he pays in taxes for the public plant,
but he pays it just the same.
Now,' if the plant is made to carry itself, to pay its own cost and ;
. expenses, then the price for its use paid by the ratepayer tells its
own story. If the administration be good and economical his rate j
receipt tells it. If it be wasteful and extravagant or corrupt the rate ;
receipt records it and the ratepayer is warned. There is no safer j
refuge for corruption and incompetence than the privilege of conceal- ;
ment that is found in charging part of the cost of a public plant to the |
citizen as a ratepayer and part to him as a taxpayer. Whenever and
wherever that privilege exists the people are abused. The adminis
tration of a municipal plant should be widely separated from politics,
and this cannot be done if the plant "rest upon the credit of the city,
its cost a lien upon the taxpayer and its deficits chargeable to the
general fund. This is so obviously a business proposition that no
one ventures to argue against it. No one controverts it. Then why
not adopt it and proceed to put it in practice?
The people of California voted the bonds for the new ferry build
ing in this city, because they were based upon the property they
created, to be paid out of its revenues. They voted the new seawall
bonds for the same reason. If the ferry depot and seawall bonds had
been a lien upon the taxpayers both would have been beaten. The
vote of San Francisco and Oakland alone would have beaten them. I
The users of the ferry building and the new seawall pay for them, as
users and not as taxpayers, and those who do not use them do not
pay a baubee for them. Let the voters of the two cities apply the
same principle to the acquisition of other public utilities, charge their
cost to the users, to be paid in their rates, and leave the public credit
free of embarrassment. This is the deep water of the water question.
All else is a puddle. __________^^^
THE SUNDAY CALL MAGAZINE.
I i t-x OUBLE HARNESS," by Anthony Hope, runs through its
Pj 1 third installment in the Sunday Call Magazine to-morrow.
* â There is no writer of the present day better qualified by ex
perience and observation to write upon the present day problems in
social ethics than Anthony Hope and no writer who knows the Lon
don life of which he writes better than he. Time and again his won
derful faculty for creating scenes in which the play of mind on mind,
as keen as was the sword play of the gallants of his earlier romantic
novels, is given free scope with a breadth of grasp never attained in
. his earlier works. The problem considered, that of a wife, who; es
tranged from her husband's love, looks for comfort and understand
ing in another man, is one that is ever present in every grade of life,
and for that reason takes hold of readers of all classes. The ultimate
. solution of the problem as he handles it is sane and wholesome.

LADY KITTY'S TEMPTATION
HEY rode slowly. Lady Kitty
T somewhat ahead, probably be
cause the trail is narrow and
treacherous below Lost Moon,
possibly so that Allison should
not see her face.
Half a mile back they had ridden
side by side. The trail had been wider
then. Lady Kitty did not care to re
member any other reason for the
proximity, but the flush on her cheeks
and the slightest possible tilt to her
chin belied her powers of forgetful
ness.
As for Allison, he was shamelessly
self-possessed and at ease. She had
even caught him whistling as they
turned Into Red Mountain Gulch, and
when she had deliberately ridden
ahead he had not tried to Join her.
Lady Kitty felt Irritated by the im
penitence expressed in his confident
attitude and also by the knowledge
that he was looking at her. It Is not
pleasant to feel a person's steady gaze
behind one. If it had been any one
else she would certainly have reported
their unpardonably rude conduct to
Major Dick, but she couldn't report
A ilieon. The major would laugh at
her.' More than that, and Lady Kit
ty's flush deepened, the major would
say the young cub had more grit than
he gave him credit for, and when any
one as charming and deliciously lov
able as Lady Kitty had flirted with
and encouraged such a man as Bob
Allison she must expect the worstâ
or the. best, according to her point of
view. The major could be very ag
gravating.
And she had not flirted with Alli
son, not at all. If they chose = to call
common* social civilities -flirting in this
barbarous land of the lariat and cow
pony she .was not to blame. It had
been lonesome at Lost Moon, or rather,
by the time the major's party, had
reached the ranch, Lady Kitty, had
seen so many- lariats and '(cow; ponies
that the novelty had begun to pall and
Allison had loomed up as a .welcome
distractionâ she had almost' said - "at
traction" to herself.
He was good to ; look at. ; this tall,
lean, strong young Westerner, with
his sunburn â ; a cross tint between \ tan

She had seen him first when he came
to meet them at the little lop-sided,
pine beard depot at Omri. She had
stood on the platform when the train
drew in, and over the major's dove
colored sombrero she had caught a
g-limp.se of a silent, erect figure on a
black pony, his hat pulled down over
his eyes, his chin up, as he leisurely
surveyed their party. She had liked
the clear, cool glance of his gray eyes.
There was something so serenely well
balanced and self-sufliclent In their
expression when they met hers that
Lady Kitty had felt a pleasurable
tingle ; of expectancy, as though â¢ the
charm of her femininity had received
a challenge.
There was no doubt but that she
had met it. It had not seemed seri
ous, merely a part of the trip. He had
not appeared worth considering like
the other men, whom, as the major
neatly put it, had appreciated their
blessings when Lady Kitty had smiled
on them. She had felt that in a day
or so she could nod good-by, and
leave him with the same comfortable
regret as Red Mountain itself, with
its gorgeous, sunset tinted, sandstone
peak. She had not taken the man him
self into consideration at all, and now,
suddenly, without a* word of warning,
the man had leaned from his saddle,
and had kissed her.
She tried to forget to remember. the
awXul moment, but its few details
danced through â¢ her mind ; Insistently.
There had been a long silence after
she had told him they were going
away from -Lost Moon in the morn
ing. The party was going through
Arizona, the major, Mrs. Major and
the major minors, all : girls, and . her
self. From Arizona* they would go back
to England. And suddenly the black
pony had drawn" nearer to. her < own
brown mustang, and Allison's armihad
swung around her, and he had '* kissed
her. Incidentally, Lady Kitty was un
certain that she had not â No, she had
not, she told herself positively.. ; She
had only permitted him to kiss her,. but
that was i quite enough. And; that was

something to him.
"I might have expected that a person
like you w'ouldtdo. that sort of thing."
' She had meant to crush and humiliate
him, and" he had : laughed and \ let \ her
ride on ahead.;: She wondered uneasily
whether j or \ not there '.was any. reason
for his- cheerfulness/ Had she or had

CaL "Dog days" is applied to that
part of the summer from about the
beginning of July to the middle of
\ugust â originally applied to the time
during which Sirlus. or the Dog Star,
was above the horizon with the sun.
But now and for a long time. It has
been asserted that the rising and set-
curious sense of delicious Deril pos
sessed her. It was the first time In her
life that she had not felt sure of her
self so far as a man was concerned.
Just now she had a wild. Joyous belief
that if thi3 Westerner were to ask her
to be his wife she would say "yes." She
wondered if he would.
If they .were only not going to-mor
rowâIf only there was not home and
her father and Rodney. Of course,
Rodney. She almost laughed out loud
to think all at once how completely he
had gone out of her life the last week.
And they were to be married in Easter
week next spring. Poor old' Rodney!
She looked at the figure ahead on the
black pony and sighed happily. If only
he would talk to her.
They turned a bend in the path and
faced a small mountain cabin. Some
chickens and pigeons wandered haught
ily about and a girl was shooing them
away from a suaggling fringe of red
geraniums that grew around the stoop.
She came toward them smilingly. Lady
Kitty thought she had never seen such
honest, trusting eyes before except in
deer. She looked up at Allison.
"Hello, Bob. Them chickens are Just
terrible. No, dad's gone over to the
ranch. There's a washout down in the
gulch. He wants some of the boys to
help him fix up the trail. Want to rest
up a bit and wait?
Allison said "no," he would ride on a
little and see if the path was safe
down Booty's side of the mountain.
"This is Miss Boot,' Lady Kitty." he
added as he rode away.
Dimple Booty watched until the plnea
hid him.

Government Brings Forward
Important Witness in the
Oregon Land Fraud Cases
PORTLAND. Dec 2.â The climax in
the land frauds trial, so far as the
Government is concerned, has been
reached and the law has but one more
witness to be placed on the stand and
then the prosecution will close Its case.
Throughout the prosecution's case the
evidence has been more or less sensa
tional, dragging, as it has, the names
of men high in the councils of the Gov
ernment into the public eye in an un
enviable light and leaving many pe
culiar transactions to be explained by
the defense. To-day'B testimony was
exceptionally startling.
A. W. Heidicke, an aged woodsman,
broken by his guilt, confessed the story
of his relations with the accused men
and women and told a story that could
not be shaken under cross-examina
tion by Judge O'Day, chief counsel for
the defense. From Helfilcke's testi
mony many things are expected to
spring.
The name of N. Haskell Withe, the
lumberman of La Crosse, Wis., wag
connected with the case to-day by the
testimony of Ira P. Hower, who told of
having loaned Horace G. . McKlnley
$2100 on the George A. Howe lands,
which were transferred to Withe.
The testimony of Heidicke told the
story of the alleged conspiracy prac
tically from its inception up to the time
the Grand Jury made Its investigation
and to-night his story remains uncon
troverted. The defense will begin to
show its hand at to-morrow's session
of the court.
YOLO SUPERVISORS
RESTRAINED BY COURT
Rico Brothers Complain That a Pro
posed Reclamation District Mill
Injure Them In Business.
Complaint has been filed in the
United States Circuit Court by Joseph
Gonzales Rico and Frank G. Rico,
subjects of the King of Portugal,
against the Board of Supervisors of
Yolo County and J. H. Glide of Sac
ramento. The complainants allege
that they own 207 acres of reclaimed
swamp land in reclamation district
No. 307; that Glide owns 887 acres
in the same district, and that he has
petitioned the Supervisors to divide
the district by making Glide's land a
new district. If this should be done,
the complainants say they will be de
prived of the full use of the levees,
ditches, etc., now in the district and
will be obliged to expend large sums
of money in 'constructing new ones.
Judge Morrow granted a temporary
injunction until the matter can bo
heard on its merits..

WILL NOT OPEN
DIVORCE SUIT
Appeal Is to Be Taken From
Judge Troutt ? s Refusal to
Admit Husband's New Plea
POINT IS IMPORTANT
Involves Conduct of Party
Who Has an Interlocutory
Decree â Alimony Orders
Judge Troutt's denial of a motion to
admit a supplemental answer in the
Mathews 'divorce case yesterday will
be appealed to the Supreme Court by
Samuel M. Shortridge, attorney for 1
William A. Mathews. A serious ques
tion involving the rights of litigants is
raised.
On November 5, 1903, * Mrs. Lois
Mathews was granted an interlocutory
decree of divorce and awarded the cus
tody of their children, with $30 a
month alimony. Tha prescribed year
had elapsed, but the final decree had
not been entered, and yesterday Math
ews sought to deprive his wife of
a right to divorce by presenting an
affidavit to the court charging her with
the commission of specific acts of in
fidelity on dates between April and
November of this year. Judge Troutt
held that the motion was" in the nature
of an application for a new trial, and
he denied it. Thereupon he granted
Mrs. Mathews a final decree and set
\ next Thursday for the hearing of a
motion to modify the decree to permit
the husband to have the custody of
the children and cease the payment of
alimony. Mr. Shortridge remarked
that the court was granting â¢ the
divorce in the face of an uncontradict
ed affidavit that the wife had been un
faithful.
SHORTREDGE ARGUES.
Attorney Shortridge contended that
the interlocutory decree was not a
divorce, and that until the final decree
is granted the parties are married.
Only two things, he said, could, dis
solve the union â death and a final de
cree. Therefore, if a plaintiff were
granted an interlocutory decree and
should thereafter commit any act in
violation of the marriage contract the
court could not hold him or her guilt
less, and should decline to grant the
final decree, which is the divorce.
In several of the departments ; of
court yesterday orders for alimony and
maintenance were made. In Judge
Troutfs court Maud C. Potter showed
that she had been active in trying to
Â«:ompel her husband, who is a grip
man on the Hayes-street line, to pay
?7G he owes, but Judge Troutt thought
there was not sufficient evidence of
service of the order to show cause and
continued the hearing. , '
Judge Sloss ordered A. K. Henry to
pay Isabella M. Henry $7 50 a week
until the trial cf her divorce suit on
January 9.
Judge Kerrigan gave Thomas B.
Eagen of San Jose a week in which to
pay up and ordered L. H. Guion to
contribute $30 a month to Rosie Guion.
Fred W. Murphy, owner of a half in
terest In the 550,000 - business of the
Pacific Boiler Works, was commanded
by Judge Muraaky to give his wife,
Lillian, f50 a month for herself and
Tour-month-old babe, and Dr. E. D.
Colburn, a dentist, was instructed to
pay ,$40 a month to his wife, Emily,
whom he married last May and who
sued him for separate maintenance.
Leontlne Weber, who declines to get
a divorce from Albert Weber, was
awarded $35 a month by Judge Troutt.
Thomas Collins, an employe of the
United States Mint, was told by Judge
Graham to pay his wife's alimony in
a week or go to Jail. /
DIVORCE GRANTED.
Divorces were granted by Judge
Troutt to Emma R. Miller from Otis
H. Miller, desertion; to.Annie M. Wil
liamson from C. C. Y. Williamson,
cruelty. By Judge Graham to Johan
nah Gorman from Thomas Gorman,
cruelty: to Lulu I. Case from Robert
Case, cruelty. Judge Kerrigan an
nulled the marriage of Mae Elizabeth
Brown and John O. Brown because it
was illegal. Brown got an interlocu
tory decree of divorce from his wife,
Eliza, on May 8, 1902, and on the same
day went to another county and wed
ded Elizabeth.
Suits for divorce were filed by Grace
L. Davis against Preston R. Davis,- a
civil engineer, for neglect: Theresa
Riley against John Riley, cruelty.
TECHNICAL. SOCIETY HEARS
BENJfETT'S CONCLUSIONS
Claims That Man Does Not Maintain
High Standards of Ability
at Night.
The Technical Society of the Pa
cific Coast held its second session yes
terday at the Mechanics' Library
building, 31 Post street, George .W.
Dickie, the president, in the chair.
In a paper on "Some Weak Points In
Long-Distance Electric Transmission"
James C. Bennett stated that a promi
nent characteristic of the many stop
pages of current is the time of their
occurrence. On referring to records it
is to be observed, said Bennett, that
by far the greater number take place
at night. Mechanically this should not
be so, a fact which inclines him. to the
belief that its principal cause must be
one that renders the occurrence well
nigh unavoidable, vis.: That men do
not maintain their highest standard of
ability and reliability at night as dur
ing the daytime.
Bennett said that night is, as all
know, not a natural time for man to
be expected to be fully up to. his high
est standard of mental activity. ,
Frank P. Medina read a paper on
"Engineering and, the -Law" .and J.
Richards gave a paper on' "Phenomena
of Machine Operations.". , V
In the evening Edward T. Hewitt
delivered an Interesting address on

The demurrer of P. Marslcano. to
the complaint of the State of v Califor
nia for the abatement of "Marslcano's
place'' : on Dupont street was .' on th*
calendar in Judge Sloss' department
yesterday, but the court was not pre
pared to hear. the arguments. .He said
that he would hear them -on Monday,
but Attorney Collins suggested that
the Monnier will contest, in " which . ho
is engaged, would then be on trial.
He then went to Judge Graham to
see if the latter ' case could go over,
but Judge Graham would not consent.
Thereupon Mr. . Collins ' said he would
submit his . Marsicano argument .'by
brief. This will be answered ; orally
by Max ; Kuhl or H. W. Hutton, Tand
Mr. Collins /will : reply in turn . by : brief .
In this way he ; can . handle the two

LEADING MEN TO SPEAX
Movement to Arouse Public
, Interest in Arbitration
Treaties . Meets Success
The agitation in all , parts of the
United States to urge Congress at Its
coming session to ratify, the proposed
treaties of international arbitration ; is
finding a fertile field in . San Fran
cisco. Leading citizens have allied
themselves in, hearty enthusiasm with
the movement. On Monday evening a
mass meeting will be held at the Tem
ple Emanu-El. Speech' making' will
arouse popular interest and resolu
tions will be adopted asking Congress
to work for international peace..
Governor George C. Pardee will pre
side at the meeting. He will be called
to the chair by Circuit Judge W. W.
Morrow, who is president of the Pa
cific Coast branch of the , American
Conference on International Arbitra
tion.
Some of the best speakers and most
prominent men of the West will argue
for the American Government's par
ticipation in the treaty making yoiner
forward among the nations. Among
those who will deliver addresses are
Dr. David Starr Jordan, Dr. Benja
min Ide Wheeler, Rabbi Jacob "Voor
sanger, the Rev. Bradford Leavltt,
Franklin K. Lane, Sheldon Kellogg
and United States Circuit Judge Wil
liam H. Hunt of Montana.
During Cleveland's administration
the effort was made to have the Unit
ed States join in arbitration treaties,
but it failed. A determined move
ment is now being made throughout
the country to bring about favorable
legislation and meetings similar to
that in San Francisco Monday evening
are to be held this month in all the
large cities. John W. Foster, former
ly Secretary of State, is at the head
of the organization formed to arouse
public opinion. â  â¢
Treaties with Great Britain, France,
Germany and Mexico are now ready
for submission to the Senate. Others
are in course of preparation. It is hoped
and expected that the United States
will take a leading part in the prog
ress of arbitration by adopting these
compacts. The tenor of them all is
that "differences of a Judicial order,
or relative to the interpretation of ex
isting treaties, which it may not have
been possible to settle by diplomacy,'
shall be submitted to the Permanent
Court of Arbitration established by
the convention of July 29, 1899, at
The Hague, on condition, however,
that neither the vital interests nor the
independence or honor of the two
contracting states nor the interests of
any state other than- the two con
tracting states . are involved."

SAN BERNARDINO,, Dec. 2.âAddt
son Chester -Dewey, -who was relieved
by the death of his wife from a suit for
divorce, has been making: life interest
ing f or. her. sisters. Mrs. H.H. Harkin
son, one of the sisters and. executrix of
the dead woman's will, had given, or
ders to an undertaker In Upland to pre
pare; the body for shipment to San
Francisco, where It was to be buried.
Dewey- learned of this and signified his
disapproval to Mrs. Harklnson, who
paid no attention to him. Then Dewey
called on the undertaker and demanded
that the body should be given burial in
the spot of hla selection, but the un
dertaker, too, ignored him.
Baffled, at Upland,- Dewey cam* to
San Bernardino and tried to find his at
torney . to secure an â¢ Injunction to pre
vent the removal of the body, but the
attorney was not In the city and Dewey
would consult no other. .
Dewey is said to have declared when
the divorce summons was served on
him that he also had grounds for a di
vorce and that he was glad his wife
had taken such a step. Sensational de
velopments are expected when the will
is contested.
Says Good Words for Japan.
Bishop r M.C. Harris of the Ameri
can Missionary Society gave an inter
esting lecture last evening: in the au
ditorium of the T. M. C. A, building
on Japan's effort to overcome the in
roads of - Russia in Korea and Man
churia. The speaker related the story
of Japan's attempt to keep from be
ing gobbled up by the Russian bear
prior to the â  breaking out of the war.
He spoke for. the Japanese and said
that the American people would learn
that the* success of the Mikado's men
would mean a great deal for the Unit-
ed States, especially the Pacific Coast.
A- large > part of the audience was
composed of young Japanese students,
who listened with great intere3t to the
Bishop's words and frequently Inter
rupted him with applause. Btshop
Harris said that the great peril in the
Far East was not the "yellow peril,"
but the "white peril." Japan would
eventually win and the threatened in
vasion of Korea and curtailing of
trade . in Manchuria would no longer
be a menace to the commerce of this
country.
After. the lecture a subscription for
the benefit of the poor Japanese fam
lles whose men folk are fighting
their country's battles was taken up.

Flnancial Report Untrue.
United Railroads officials are trying
to discover the source of a report re
cently circulated concerning a purport
ed statement from President Holland
relative to the finances of the company.
In discussing the matter yesterday an
official of the company said:
"No recent public statement has been
made either by the president or by any
other officer regarding the finances of
the company. The alleged report is in
correct, misleading and not justified by
the facts. Furthermore, the officials
say that surplus earnings are not being
diverted from the requirements for the
maintenance and â  Improvement of the
property."

SCOTTISH BOWLING DRAWS MANY ENTHUSIASTS TO GOLDEN GATE PARK GREEN
WHERE IT CAN BE ENJOYED UNDER PLEASANT CONDITIONS
THREE FIELDS

Oakland Hornets Are
Matched Against
Occidentals.
From this time forward the matches
on the schedule of the California Asso
ciation Football League for the cham
pionship of 1904-1905 should be played
regularly, as four grounds are avail
able, viz.: Freeman's Park. Golden
Gate: Idora Park, Oakland; the ground
at Eighth and Harrison streets and the
cricket field at Alameda.
The three matches scheduled for to
morrow are: Independents versus Pick
. wicks, at Freeman's Park; Vampires
versus Albion Rovers, at Alameda, and
Oakland Hornets versus Occidentals, at
Idora Park. In all three matches the
!>ell will be kicked off at 2:30 p. m. The
Kagles have no match to-morrow, ha\>

" W. T. Bowcock as goalkeeper for the
Pickwicks played an excellent game
last Sunday. The Albion Rovers' score
would have been considerably larger
had it not been for many fine saves by
him. On the Rovers' side the right
wing did all the scoring, Shand putting
the ball into the net once by a clever
iiack kick, and repeatedly working it
up half the length of the field and cen
tering it right in front of the posts.
McArthur played a strong game, scor
ing four goals.
The standing of the clubs for the
.championship of the present season is

';'â¢:- WITH AUSTRALIAN TEAM
:\i:tipoÂ«irnii Cracks Will Pass Through
San Francisco on Their Way
. ' to durland.
JV meeting of the California Cricket
Association will be held in this city
on- Monday^ evening. The chief mat
ters for discussion will be the pro
posed acquisition of a new ground for
cricket and the visit of the Australian
â eleven of 1905 to this city next spring.
The Australians will be on their
â¢way to England, which they expect to
reach at the end of March, their open
ing match to be played early In April.
If satisfactory arrangements can be
made with Major Wardlll, the man
ager of the Australian team, a match
.will be played here between the Aus
tralians and an eighteen of Califor
nia. The secretary of the California
Cricket Association has addressed a
letter to Major Wardill. in which the
suggestion is made that a game be
played in San Francisco.
Lovers of cricket in thiÂ« city and
the neighborhood would be glad to
see the cracks from the Antipodes and
the Australians would probably be
willing after three weeks on board
ship to stretch their legs on a cricket
field. The CaJifornians will be quite
out of practice, as the earliest games
in' California are not played until
April, whereas the Australians are not
only superb players, but will leave
their country at the height of the
summer cricket season there.
Woman Fights for Her Children.
A sad sight presented itself yesterday
to Secretary White of the Society for
Prevention of Cruelty to Children and
Police Officer Young when they tried to
Cake the two little children, respective
ly two and four years old, from Mrs.
Goldberg at her neglected hovel, 21*4
Hayward place. The woman, who is
feehle minded, clung to the children
with the tenacity of a wild animal. The
husband and father of the household
is a confirmed opium fiend and was re
moved to the City and County Hospi
tal for treatment while the mother was
placed in a cell in the Detention Hos
pital for examination touching . her
mental condition. The children were
taken In charge by Secretary White

VETERANS BOWL WITH THE ARDOR OF YOUTH
Important Match to
Be Bowled To-Day
at Oakland.
"Bowling on the green," or Scottish
bowls, was introduced in San Fran
cisco about two years ago by a few
enthusiastic Scotchmen. In that pe
riod of \tlme it has become an im
mensely popular pastime among men
of all nationalities and ages. The
game appeals more strongly to men
past the meridian of life, but it also
has some youthful followers.
At present there are several Scot
tish bowling clubs on the coast, the
largest being here and in Oakland.
The home club has a membership of
about 100, while the club across the
bay numbers about half that many
members. The Claremont Country
Club has laid out a splendid green,
which will be used to-day for the first
time in an inter-club match. Teams
from the San Francisco and Oakland
clubs will meet and formally open the
new green.
This match is unusually interesting
because of the fact that San Fran
cisco won the last inter-club contest
on the Oakland green, while the pre
vious match was won by Oakland on
the San Francisco green. This will
be the first meeting of the clubs' rep
resentatives on a neutral green. Each
club will send its best twelve men
into the fray. San Francisco will pin
its faith to the following: Y. C. Law
son, W. R. Eaton. H. L. Tickner. J.
S. Webster, A. A. McVicar, J. CV Mof
fatt, judge Lucien Shaw, Artdrew Mc-
Xair, Thomas Altken, Robert Park, T.
Millar and T. McXaught.
No tournament matches will be
played on the park green to-day, as
most of the cracks will be across the
bay. Play will be resumed next week.
Trre doubles* tournament which has
been under way for some time will be
completed as soon as possible.
Y. C. Lawson. the man who intro
duced Scottish bowling here and an
enthusiastic worker in its cause, will
leave for 'New York next month. Mr.
Lawson was the first president of the
club and its first champion. The suc
cess of the club and popularity of the
game is due in a 'great extent to his
untiring efforts. H. L. Tickner. the
new club president, is another en
thusiast, who will prove a worthy suc
cessor to Mr. Lawson. M. L. Crowe
was the second champion. J. C. Mof
fatt the third and Dr. Hamilton the
present champion.

Association of the Knights of Pythias,
on a charge of disturbing the peace.

Knights of Pythias.

DUCK SHOOTERS
ARE HOPEFUL
Improvement in Sport Is

Weather.
It is evident from the returns made
by the cleverest duck shooters â¢ that
conditions on the various marshes last
Sunday were not favorable for good
sport. Otto Feudner, who rarely re
turns with less than the limit, brought
down only thirty-five. Clarence Nau
man shot on .the U. M. C. preserve at
Collinsville and bagged but twenty
two. Charles Long secured sixteen at
the same place. A. M. Shields
acknowledged the ownership of a
string v of twelve. The shooting

The best reports come from the vi
cinity of Alvarado, where Dan Os

marked success, several limit bags be-
ing secured.
The moon now being obscured, bet
ter sport is expected this w-eekTâVThe
birds were , in the habit during the
moonlights-nights of coming in from
the bay and enjoying the hospitality
afforded by the heavily baited ponds.
They would then return in the early
morning to their" favorite haunts out
of reach of the gunners.
The bay is full of fine canvasbacks,
but they do not work well for the
guns. Those that are killed are pro
nounced of fine flavor. Frank Mas
terson, Tom Lewis and Mr. Barber
killed twenty- two, "cans", at Collins
ville on Wednesday out of a total bag
of twenty-eight.
Down San Bruno way and about
Vallejo and San Pablo the sportsmen
are getting a large proportion of blue
biJls. The full flight of northern birds
has not set In. yet, according to well
Informed gunmen. Most of the birds
killed are not in the full, plumage
usually found In birds known to have
come out of the north.

Club found a large/number of birds
on the â¢ ponds and sloughs of their

and Miss A. N. Smith of the Los An

Golf Club, two of the strongest golfers
of their sex in the State, have been
active in the organization of a proposed
"California Women Golfers' Associa
tion," which will begin operations in
January, 1905. The association is on
the same lines as the Women's Western
Golf Association, which has greatly in
creased the. Interest of ladles in golf
around Chicago and through its secre
tary, and organizers has given the ben
flt of its experience to the leading spir
its of the C. W. G. A. Most of the
members of the executive committee of
the Pacific Coast Golf Association,
with many secretaries and leading
members of the golf clubs, have signi
fied their approval of the proposed
women's association. * â  . .
The dues of each club to the C. W.
G. A. are to' be $10 a year. A handicap
tournament on the links of each club
is to be played about every six weeks,
and: a team match between north and
south Is to take place at each regular
yearly championship event.' The women
golfers of each club will be expected I
to play In as many tournaments as I
possible and to encourage others to do
so, their only expenses being lunch
eons, fares and caddie fees. â  ....
â¢ There wlir be "no regular prizes at
each tournament, but there may be an
association medal .or 'an association
cup.. If a medal is decided on the
player winning. the largest number of
medals during a year will be handicap
champion for the succeeding year. If
a cup is decided on the name of the
winner will be engraved on it and her
club will hold it till it is won from her.
A standard system of handicapping
will be adopted, by which each club
can handicap' its players so that they
may have their regular standing at all
tournaments.'* â¢

WANT PURE BLOOD
Some Promising Grey
hounds Change Owners.
From the registrations and other de
tails of breeding filed with the Cali
fornia Coursing Committee it Is evident
the standard of greyhounds on this
coast will not deteriorate for years to
come. The number of greyhounds bred
is large while the quality Is of the
best. The sires which stand highest
among the winners are In strong de
mand, showing the coursing men want
the best strains available.
George Nethercott of Sacramento,
whose kennels have produced some sen
sational performers in recent years,
has registered a litter of ten puppies
by Rocker- Freda C. Six of them are
dogs.
Tommy ,Hall, the veteran coursing
man of Merced, has registered a litter
by Rocker-Clara Barton. The latter
was a good performer on the plains.
W. D. Murphy has purchased Idaho
Boy from G. Lacy Crawford.
S. Mahoney has bought Lydia, a
promising puppy by Rocker-Bumble
Bee.
W. P. Spencer has bought Yellow
stone, a puppy of the same litter, which
performed well last week.
Dr. F. P. Clark of Stockton has pur
chased from James Sweeney the six
teen-month-old puppy Creole Sue. She
is of the second litter of Rocker-Fiery
Face. The first litter included such fast
ones as Richard Anton, Rocker Arm,
Raby Aurora and others. Dr. Clark will
start it at Stockton for the Lonjer Cup.
which is run for each year in Decem
ber by young greyhounds owned in the
San Joaquin Valley.
Wilson and Allen of Victor, Iowa, are
preparing to send a strong string of
greyhounds to this coast. H. D. Lowe
of Kansas has sent two and will send
on some more. The two already on the
ground are Peerless Beauty and Lan
cashire Lad. They have shown great
speed and cleverness and much is ex
pected of them.
The management of Union Park is
already making arrangements for the
Inaugural Stake, which is run annually
on January 1. The entrance fee will be
$25 and an entry of sixteen is expected.
A class stake and a reserve event will
make up this week's card at Ingleslde
Coursing Park. The meeting will com
mence to-day and will be concluded to
morrow. There will be no coursing at
Union Park this week owing to the
Illness of Judge P. J. Reilly. A strong

PLAYERS REST
AFTER SEVERE
TENNIS WORK
No Tournaments Are
on Schedule for
This Week.
Popular Drummond
MacGavin Leaves
for Europe.
After the strenuous play of last week
the tennis cracks will be given a chance
to rest up for a time. No tournaments
are scheduled and only a few matches
held over from last week's events will
be played to-day and to-morrow. The
continuous tournament will be started
to-morrow, but this will be easy on the
r-players, as they play but once a week.
The principal event will be the match
between George 'anes ard Al. Kenyon.
They met in the finals at the Thanks
' giving day handicap tournament and
each had won two sets when darkness
put a, stop to play. Instead of resum
! Ing play where it was left off the men
! have agreed to play two seta out of
three to-morrow
Kenvon will receive odds of "15"
while Janes will be "15" behind scratch.
These odds are about right as the
match last Sunday proved. Although
the match was a tie Janes looked to
have a little the best of the argument.
Kenyon Is an erratic player and if he
happens to have a "streak" on to-mor
row the scratch "man will be kept busy.
Janes is a steady player and seems at
his best under handicap conditions.
This fact is rather remarkable because
Janes, unlike most successful handicap
players, hits the ball hard and takes
all kinds of chances.
The boys of the Golden Gate Junior
Club have two tournaments to finish
to-day. One Is a singles for a three
time loving cup. M. McLaughlin has
reached the finals and will meet the
winner of the W. Mltchell-H. Getz
match. Both matches will be played
In the afternoon. In the morning the
handicap doubles tournament will be
completed. In the flna.^t A. Martinez
and M. McLaughlin will meet H. Getz
and L. Levinson.
The fourth class singles tournament
commenced on the park courts last
Sunday will be completed to-morrow.
One match remains to be played in the
second ro-und. The contestants will be
Darns and Martin. The others who
will compete in the third round are:
Peck, Fuller, Martin, Turner, Vensano,
Brown and Miller.
The continuous tournament which
will be started on the California Club
courts will prove an Interesting affair
and also a novelty to> most of the play
ers. Events of this kind have been held
in the past, but the last was about five
years ago, before many of the present
cracks were in the game. It will de
cide who is the best player In the club.
A man's position will be determined
strictly according to his ability. The
best players will eventually rise to the
top, while poorer ones who may draw
well will soon be where they belong.
"While the entries close to-day any club
member has the right to enter when he
desires. If he enters later than to-day,
however, he will be compelled to start
at the bottom of his class. MacGavin.
Hardy and Smith will not be In the
competition, and it is a matter of spec
ulation as to who will come to the top
with these men out of it. Dr. McChea
ney looks to be the best man, although
such players as Dr. Hill, H. Long, S.
H. Adams. G. H. Busch, W. Collier and
G. Janes are about as clever as Me
Chesney.
Drummond MacGavin, coast cham
pion. State champion and bay counties
champion, leaves to-day for a trip
around the world. He will arrive in
London in June and may live there for
several years. Thereafter he expects to
reside in South Africa. MacGavin is
one of the most popular champions that
ever played tennis here. He has al
ways been a generous opponent, a good
loser and bears his laurels lightly. As a
token of their esteem MacGavin's club
mates have presented him with a hand
some diamond watch charm. When
MacGavin sails to-day he will take with
him the good wishes of every man and
woman on the coast who handles a ten
nis racket and of many who do not
PROTECTED RIFLE RANGE

Troops In Good Shape.
The new protected rifle range at tha
Presidio Is now 'practically completed.

range was constructed, feels confident
that it will meet with General Moore's
approval.
General Moore made a thorough in
spection of the cantonment at the
Presidio yesterday. He found every

SAMMY GREENFIELD
RIDES TWO WINNERS
â¢ ? \
Del Carina, a Pronounced |
Favorite. Is Extended!
to Defeat Golden Buck
The treacherous going at Oakland
track yesterday proved disastrous for f
io\iT of the public choices. Such things j
are always counted on. though, by the j
regulars -when a muddy track has to I
be taken into consideration, and their j
downfall evoked little criticism. Water- .
epout, Redan and Step Around were |
the longest priced winners. Despite the j
fact that the card was not an enticing !
looking one there was an excellent
ciowd present.
For lack of better material Instru
ment* the mount of Davis, was played
down to win the first event, and, owing
chiefly to his clever handling, won eas
ily. Crigli cut out the early running,
then grew weary and finished second,
beaten four lengths. Glenarvon, cut off
at the start and pounds the best, ran
third. Optimo, at one time a shifty
;>Â»rformer in the mud, made no show
ing whatever.
Bob Smith's Waterspout took the
t heap-looking six-furlong run, which
followed, after being allowed to drift
back from 4 to S.
MEADA INSTALLED FAVO1UTE.
Meada. the black filly from the Bian
â¢ehi stable, had the honor of being in
stalled favorite at the short price of 3
to a. "Sharkey" Butler gave her a thor
ough going over. If it had been a trot
ting event she would nave saved en
trance money, for fourth place was her
portion. Waterspout, with Sam Green
field ui>. led from the start, winning
with little to epare from the 15 to 1 out
eider Wistaria. The show went to Hin
doo Princess.
It is now a settled fact that Kunz
canno: ride Redan. That is. and ex
tract any speed from the sprinter's an
atomy. The Her.Fhall jockey had the
leg up on Redan in a five and_a half
furlonp; dash the day before, and at
the ratio of speed exhibited in that race
it would have taken Kunz fourteen
hours, twenty-three minutes and thir

t.voen Emeryville and Oakland Mole,
v.eather. v.ind and tide permitting:. In
the five-furlonp sketch yesterday Har
ry Michaels, who about three years
ajro was considered a promising kid
around New York, supported Redan.
There was some * -about the Strobel
gelding, but the buzzards plucked it
clean until only, 5 and 6 remained. ...\. T ';
P REDAN ISA WINNER.
Redan early snatched the runnine
away from Edinl>orouph and at the
"wire led out ' Little Wally half a leneth.
Helgesen arrived five and a half lengths
lite on the 11 to 10 favorite. Dr. Sher
â¢ man.- It was a reversal of form, but
upsets may be attributed to a heavy
track.,,
Helgesen rode Sugden. favorite for
the mile and hundred yard selling af
fair, ard he certainly did make a fine
bntrhy Job of it. At no. stage of the
game was the h^rse ever in it. finish
ing back lengths behind the leaders.
Frank Sullivan landed the purse with
Step Around, a 10 to 1 shot, after
Blackthorn had taken the lead and
looked a winner turning into the
stretch. Davis was third on Dusty
Miller.
Del Carina, another one from Bob
Smith's stable, was successful in the
six furlong sprint for two-year-olds.
Four to five could be obtained about
the filly, at which price the mare was
heavily supported. Golden Buck put
up such a string argument that
Greenfield rode the first choice almost
from the jump and at the finish earned
the verdict by less than a length. Ara,
the Stevefts entry, secured show hon
ors.
.There was nothing to the last but
. Brennus. He had Helgesen on his back
and. reached home two lengths before
the 6" to 5 favorite Educate, piloted by
Davis. The latter had no excuses, belnsr
"Eimply outrun. Flaneur ran third.
TRACK NOTES.
Sammy Greenfield, who left here last
spring with Bob Smith's stable prac
tically a novice in the saddle, is loom

rode two winners yesterday, both from

next Monday or Tuesday before ac
cepting any mounts. In the interim
he will gallop a few horses every

BOOKIES ARE HARD HIT
Four Favorites Catch the Eyes of the
Judges in Ascot Park Races.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 2.â The success
of four favorites at Ascot to-day dealt
a serious blow to the books. One horse
especially was heavily played, Ignacio
taking the last race at, a mile and sev
enty yards, after having been backed
from 3 to 1 to 8 to 5. The other win
ning favorites were: Harbor, Judge
Denton and Doctor C. Sportsman and
Ericula, winners of the first and second
races, respectively, were heavily played
second choices. On the whole the day
was a disastrous one for the books and
a correspondinglv happy one for the
public players. A light rain fell after
the second race, but served only to
make the track a little heavier than it
was left by the dampness of the early
morning. Kent rode two winners, Hil
debrand two, Walsh and Booker one
each. Summary:
First race, five and a half furlongs â Sports
men. 104 (Kent), 4 to 1, won; Mary's Gallant.

TIGERS BURIED
BY THE ANGELS
Southern Stars Pile Buns
Up When the Champions
Are Making- the Errors
The errors and the strikeouts and the
runs and the hits and other things
came so thick and fast yesterday at
Recreation Park that even Mike Fisher
threw up his. mitts, when he tried to
keep, tab on all that was coming off.
The Angels, did more bunching of runs
and hits and less of errors than the
Tigers, and victory was theirs beyond a
doubt after the ninth inning was over.
Scoreâ Los Angeles 10, Tacoma 6.
It was a bad 'game of ball in every
respect. Few of the runs were earned.
Both pitchers were wild, Fitzgerald in
particular, for â  he gave eight bases on
balls. . The fielders were all erratic. Joe
Corbett managed to boot three around
the second bag. and they all counted in
the run-getting..
The Tigers took a lead of four in the
first three innings, and it looked easy
for them till the Angels got the bases
full in the fourth. They made runs sys
tematically, one, at a time. In all live
were shoved over before Dolly. Gray
found where he was at once again
This took a lot of fight out â¢ of the
Tigers and .made , the Angels feel like ;
big leaguers.
The Angels put the finishing touches
on their day's work in the ninth spasm
by hammering three through. The Ti
gers began to do a little sticking at the
last' moment, but failed to come
through and let two men die on the
sacks. The score:

CLUB WILL NAME ROCHE
IF MEN DISAGREE.
WETTING DISCUSSED
Bxitt Practically Decides to Train
11111 at the Ocean Beach.
â¢..â¢ There" were : disquieting rumors yes
terday J that' Jimmy Britt. had decided
not to -abide \by his agreement of the
previous day to accept Billy Roche as
a referee for, his nght ; "\vith Nelson',
but that he wanted the .club to name
the man who would referee. Manager
| Coffroth this rumor indirectly
and at once said that in be # half of :the
Yosemite Club if it was left to" that or
ganization that he. would. name Roc^e.
j By having the club name \ the referee
i Britt would place it in the' position of
guaranteeing him fair treatment in the
ring. ' â ;:â¢'".--â¦â¢.--.-.
Eddie Graney said yesterday that he
would not accept the position â¢ of â¢ ref
eree nor would he- act* in any other pro
fessional contest. -If his health will
permit he will serve the Olympic Club
whenever the officials of that organiza
tion desire his ; services.
Britt and Charley Krellng. who will
assist him in his -training operations,
visited- the Seal Rock House at the
1 ocean beach yesterday, and practically
decided upon doing his training there.
It is considered a good advertisement
for the fight to have him in suoh a
readily accessible place for visitors.
The only question is' whether; he can
'secure the privacy there he desires. He
will determine to-day, on this score and
will commence his training. this after
noon. The measurements of the men
taken before their recent fights -will
prove of interest to the followers of
the ring. They; are as follows:
Britt V Nelson
5 feet 6 inches.". Height 5 feet "U â¢ Inches
132 pound* -."Weight 132 pounds
65*-i Inches. ...... Reach 67^ Inches

â  The Interesting question as to what
the odds wlllbe when Britt and Nel
son, meet Js being discussed wherever
sporting men congregate. It is ex
pected Britt will open an 8 to 10 choice
and "there are some persons who are
alreadv' .willing to bet 7 to 10 that he
will be, returned the winner. Nelson
undoubtedly will have- a large follow
ing/as he has won all his fights on the
short end. : Opinions differ as to
whether Britt can stop the wonderful
Dane. The friends of the latter claim
he cannot be knocked out, while the
admirers of the hard-hittine- Califor
nian are sure he can turn the trick.
Nelson was present at the flKhts in
Woodward Pavilion last night and was
warmly greeted by the spectators.
CORBETT SEEKS A MATCH
Will Train ' Earnestly, to Show His
Good Intentions.
Young Corbett has awakened to a
realization of the mistakes he has made

post a. forfeit of $1000 to bind a match

STORM SWEEPS
OVER CHICAGO
Winter Reaches the Middle
West, Bringing With It
a: General Fall of Snow
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Dec. 2.â Genuine winter,
with the first real snowstorm of the
season, swept over Chicago to-day.
Traction lines throughout the city were
badly handicapped. Patrons ofthe sub
urban trains were late in reaching the
city. Cold weather and snow delayed
all the mail trains from thirty minutes
to an hour. Snow did not fall insuf
ficient quantity in this section of â  the
country* to seriously impede â¢ railroad
traffic, however. . .
A minimum temperature of 10 degrees
above zero, with several inches of
snow, is the prediction of the local
Weather Bureau for to-morrow. The
chilly blast is expected to last over
Sunday, and perhaps longer.
To-day's snowstorm prevailed as far
north as Milwaukee, where three inches
â were registered; Snow also fell- in- Ne- I
braska. North and South Dakota, Min- J
nesota and Iowa, and was accompanied
by falling temperatures. â¢.

Corbett will decide to-night as to
quarters. He. rather favors Los An
geles, but his best friends, who have
an unselfish interest in his future, want
him to select a quiet place like Billy
Shannon's, near San Rafael. Here his
work would be a pleasure to him and
he. would regain the athletic form he
has, frittered away during- the past
eight months in a butterfly existence.
- He has abandoned one foolish affec
tation. He made it a point to allow no
one to know his weight except Trainer
T.uthill. . They looked upon this as a
huge joke. As this was a sure indica
tion of his condition he would have
been much better off had he let his
friends" into the secret as they would
have -known there was something
wrong with" his training methods if he
was- a wavÂ»; above weieht and would

the next time he starts he will be in

Tenny Knocks Cari-oll Out In Font
Rounds and "May field and Kiley
Fieht a Great Battle.
A bang, a biff of the glove against
some one's jaw or body was heard for
two hourg at Woodward's Pavilion last
night when [ one of the best boxing
shows of the time was promoted by
the San Francisco Athletic Club. The
main event was a fitting windup to
the evening's sport. Lew Powell, the
champion lightweight, all but stowed
Tom Sullivan away, though he was
given a good time before the four
rounds were reeled off.
Sullivan used a straight left to the
jaw and would have brought home
the money had not Powell waded in
occasionally with well placed rights
and lefts to the body and jaw. Powell
won the fight in the last two^sounds
when he got to Sullivan's Jaw several
times with hard iolts. *Â£ullivan was
all but gone, but proved game. .
Harry Tenny copped young Jimmy
Carroll with a right to the jaw in the
fourth round, just before the bell
sounded. Up to that time the mill
was full of sensations and both men
exchanged several wallops that looked
like the ones which produce sleep.
Frank Mayfleld was awarded a deci
sion over Harry Riley that was not
earned. Both men stood up and

IKE STILL LOOKING
FOR Missrvr: ru-Â»T.rÂ»
Express Company Officials Hopeful of
Finding Coin in a For
- wardlnor Rot
The officials of W:lls-Fargro Express
Company are still in a quandary as to
what has become of the bagr contain
ing $15,000 in gold, which mysterious
ly disappeared from the forwarding
department of the corporation several
days ago. Although the representa
tives of the company publicly state
that they have not directed suspicion
against any employe and are hopeful
of discovering the missing coin in
some forwarding money box, they are
neverthelss taking various precautions
toward apprehending the thief in the
event 'of circumstances finally satisfy
ing them that the money was stolen.
Among a number of the employes of
the company the supicion exists that
the money was stolen, but those who
entertain this belief are not ooenlv Â».
pressing it.
At the office yesterday it was stated
that the company, acting under an
original theory that possibly the
money had been misplaced in a coin
box destined for some distant point, Is
having these boxes carefully checked,
as fast a s they arrive at their destina
tion. By Monday the boxes shipped j
to the more distant points, such as!
N'ew York, dn the day the coin was.
missed, will all have reached their 1
destinations and then the company !
will definitely know whether ar not !
it has been. robbed. Until then, the i
officials of the company say, they will I
not be prepared to say just how the !
money diEanneared.

j My percentage of winning ONE-BESTVBET3
i since the meeting at Oakland opened la 66 2-3
I per cent. \
\ I have given in that period 15 starters. Of
j these ten won and five lost. Odds ajralnst
: the winners were as follows: One at 1O to 1,
! one at 6 to 1. one at 4 to 1. One at 2 to 1.
: three at 6 to 5. one at even money and two at
j 3 to 5 (includlBgr yesterday's).
The average ode's against the ten winners
i was 14 to 5.
A flat hr-i of $20 on thÂ« winners and losera
alike netted $456. after deducting all losses.
For lack of space I put off publishing. thÂ«
names of all the homes given until Sunday's or
Monday's ad. Watch for it.
A ccpy of every dally message* Issued br mo
to my clients since the beginning of the Oalc-
j land meeting is en file in my office. It is not
locked in a desk, but is posted conspicuously on
the wall. In view of all clients, new and old
and prospective, who call at my office. Come
and consult it. Compare my message with my
advertisements. I'll forfeit $1000 to anybody
who can disprove any assertion I make or prov-j
tljat I ever misrepresent. *
N. B. â My complete dally wire, giving all thÂ«
information I have, which is issued trio to all
ONE-HORSE-PER-DAT clients, has. since the
beginning of Oakland, given to win a raft Ot
other dinners, at prices ranging from tirree to
five tn'nftetn to one. but none of these are l.i-
' eluded in the above showing. Yesterday it
â¢ handed out for m heavy play to win INSTRTJ-
I MENT. which was at 4 to 1. The day before
j it advised a swell bet to win on KM Crosa
Nurse which won at 8 to 1. and on others that
won. 'On rare occasions does a horse I give
for any kind of a play in my complete wire fin-
ish outside of the money. ITS A HORNADAY
HABIT, and It is inimitable.
|; To-Day a Coup!
My one-horse-per-day '-wire at Oak-
i land will to-day hand out as worth thÂ«
i biggest bet of the meeting; one of the
L surest, winners that ever was sent foi
! the money at odd3 of 4 to 1 or so. .
He worked fast enough to beat tha
field he meets to-day by a city block,
, He is lightning fast. The right money
1 will- be bet oti him!
I Unless the Jockey falls oft he'll tln-
' can it in front and cc-me home on.thÂ«

.THE , SAN FRANCISCO CALL, V SATURDAY; DECEMBER: 3; 1904
SAYS FORTUNE
IS CONCEALED
Heir of Robert's. Baker i Ac
cuses Widow of, Misappro
priating Rich Property
| HIS SHARE IS SMALI
Charges That Aunt Defraud
ed. Him of Sheep, Horses
Securities and Building
A fortune, real or phantom, that flit
ted through the Los Angeles probate
court eight years ago is being pursued
by Willlam-H. Baker, a nephew ol Rob
ert S. Eaker and heir-at-law to a oue
thirty-slxth interest in his estate. When
Robert Baker died at Los Angeles in
j?'H he was reputed to be a multi-mil
j llonaire. When his estate was dis
{ tributed, in June, 1896, there was only
j $65,500 to be portioned among the claim
ants. The nephew was surprised at the
smallness of his uncle's fortune, but he
did not become suspicious until two
years ago, when he began an investiga
! tion, which culminated yesterday in a
j suit against his aunt, Arcadia 13. de
Baker, for an accounting. The com
plaint was filed by his attorneys, Henry
j H. Davis and John D. Whaley.
: The heir says that Charles H. Forbes,
I who died In September, 1900, was the
confidential agent and manager for
Baker from 1877 until the latter's death,
and afterward, upon the wodow waiv
i ing her rights, became administrator of
j Baker's estate. Under Forbes' .admin
i istration, it is charged, 2143 shares of
. California Oil Works stock in Baker's
I name were declared to have been held
t in trust for Mrs. Baker and were
turned over to her. It is also alleged
; that Baker built the Baker block, on
I North Main and Arcadia streets, Los
| Angeles, at a cost of $250,000, but Mrs.
J Baker, claiming that she had put up
the money for the building, got the
j property. It is said, too, that many
I thousand sheep and a number of horses
were sold by Baker just before his
death and the proceeds were appro
priated by his widow, as were numer
ous shares of Los Angeles gas stock.
The plaintiff says that his first inti
mation of the condition of affairs came
! to him from a man named Cram, in
j San Francisco, . who remarked, "You
' | are worth thousands upon thousands
I and do not know it." Then John T.
I Houx, a local lawyer, told him that no
! one but Forbes and Mrs. Baker knew
. i how much Baker was really worth.
! And finally Frank Freeman, husband
! of a niece of Baker. Informed him
I that Forbes had burned all books and
i accounts of his management of the
i Baker estate just before his death.
The heir now charges that Mrs.
i Baker and Forbes systematically and
â  fraudulently concealed property of
| great value from the estate, and he de
'â  manda an accounting of all her acts
, and those of Forbes that she may
j know of.
SHOOTING AT THE MOON.
Relative of Aged Mrs. Baker Says
Husband Had No Estate
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 2.â Notice of
the suit filed in San Francisco against
Mrs. Arcadia de Baker has not been
received here, nor has there been any
service of summons. Mrs. Baker
lives at Santa Monica and is so old
that she is relieved of practically all
the cares incident to the management
of her large property. Her brother,
Mr. Bandini of Pasadena, who looks
after her interests, said to-night that
he knew nothing about any suit hav
ing been filed. Another relative, who
assists him. said:
"Charles H. Forbes was Mrs.
Baker's aeent. He has been dead
nearly five years and his agency has
been settled finally, approved by court
and is closed. The estate of Robert
Baker has been settled nearly ten
years. In the settlement Mrs. Baker
gave up much of her own property to
the heirs. The fact is, her husband
had no separate estate, but she treated
his heirs with great generosity."
Mrs. Baker Is one of the most
widely known women in Southern
California. She is related by blood or
marriage to nearly all the old Span
ish families., She Inherited her large
fortune from her father and possesses
much property throughout the county.

BRANDON C LARK
IS FOUND DEAD
Companion on a Duck Shoot
ing Expedition Discover $
Body at the Edge of Pone
CAUSE IS A MYSTERY
It Is Believed He Was At
tacked With Heart Dis
ease and Fell Iiito Watei
The body of Brandon Clark, who for
many years had been well and favor
ably known among the-,, local play-
I' houses and concert halls, was found at
the | edge c-f a marsh on the shooting
.grounds of the West .End Club near
j Mount Eden yesterday .afternoon. The
cause of his death is unknown,- but it
' is presumed that he was overcome with
I vertigo and fell face downward in the
mud and water. There was no sign of
a struggle, so the supposition is that
he never regained consciousness after
i falling.
j Clark, in company .with Frank W.
I Treat, started on a shooting trip
I Thursday night, leaving this city on
I the 11:45 boat. They arrived at Mount
j Eden at about 3:45 yesterday morning,
I and at 6 o'clock set out their decoys
and wen; into- their respective "blinds."
I Sport was very poor and at about 10:30
â¢ the two had breakfast together agree
ing to meet at 4 o'clock in the after-
I noon. The last seen of Clark alive was
at 3 o'clock, when Treat - noticed him
: gathering in his decoys. At 4 o'clock
j Treat started to walk along the shore
: toward Clark's blind and midway be
; tween the two shooting boxes found
his friend lying face downward in the
, shallow water. He pulled the body
( up on the shore but life was extinct.
; Treat says that Clark could not have
.been killed by an accidental shot as
â¢ neither fired their guns after partaking
; of their morning meal. Clark seemed
'â¢ to be in the be3t of health and spirits.
â¢ Clark was about 34 years of age and
j a widower, his wife having died about
; eighteen months ago. For many years
; he has been\engaged in the business of
i supplying ushers to theaters and for
concerts. He had an enviable reputa
ticm for reliability and integrity, the
atrical managers relying implicity on
I his word. Up to a late hour last night
the body had not been brought to Oak
land.

OF STONE ARCH
Park Commissioners Tliinl
Exhibition Stonework Is
Not Sufficiently Artistic
PRINTING BIDS GO OVEE
Special Meeting Called foi
Friday, December 9, tc
Consider the Contracts
State Mineralogist Lewis E. Aubury
believed the Park Commissioners '
would pay the cost of moving the!
stcne arch in the California exhibit at
the St. Louis Exposition to San Fran- '
Cisco. Mr. Aubury -Tid the Park Com- j
missioners could have the arch Lf â¢
| they would 'pay the freight on the \
\ stones of which it is built over the !
2000 miles of railroad. j
But the arch will not grace any of ;
the entrances to Golden Gate Park, for
the Commissioners were not inclined -
to take the matter under serious con-
I sideratlon. Upon each and ever- stone '.
. of the structure is the carved adver- |
tisement of the quarry from which the
rock was dug and, this proved to be'
the undoing of the proposition. The .
| arch was declined with thanks. ;
. The meeting of the commission was \
'called at 2 o'clock in the office of
| President A. B. Spreckels. Those pres- j
j e-nt were Commissioners Cummings, !
Dingee, Lloyd, Sullivan . and Mr. ;
Spreckels in the chair. After dispos- '
ing of the minutes of the last meet
ing the report of Superintendent John
McLaren was read and approved. The
report mentioned the recent Improve- i
ments of Bell Tower Hill and the
building of a pheasantry that will add
la new attraction to the city's big play
j ground. â¢ The domicile of the raoun
â¢ tain quail that Mr. Lloyd donated has
I been placed in good shape for the
gamey birds that will inhabit it. It was
! shown in the report that : the man '
I Flood, who said he had lost his posi
tion because of having reported to the
commission the act of a policeman In
shooting at an elk in the paddock, had
been relieved from duty by his em
ployer for other reasons. Flood
claimed financial sympathy for his al- â¢
leged martyrdom. . j
THE ARCH AGAIN. !
The secretary's report showed the '
receipts, and disbursements for No
i vember and after its reading State
i Mineralogist Aubury was introduced
and told of the California arch. The
| expense of dismantling apd shipping,
I together with the cost of re-erecting
j the arch here, would cost about $1000.
j Commissioner Sullivan said that he
thought that an arch that would not
be disfigured by advertisements and
! which would be built of various stones
I quarried in different parts of the State
would be ornamental, but he did not
favor the proposition before the board.
,Piesident Spreckels agreed with Com- ;
missioner Cummings that the structure
would be.too much of a patchwork af
fair to be artistic. '
A communication from the Calif or- '
nia. Association of Chauffeurs, request
ing that less stringent regulations be
adopted regarding the running of au- i
tomobiles through the park at night, â¢
. was read and filed. v t
j The beautiful painting. "The Break- !
. ing Ground," by Rosa Bonheur, which .
1 had bee- purchased through the ef
1 forts of Â«s. Mary Morse Green, was
â¢ accepted for the park museum. j
! J. M. Kyle, on behalf of the new '
; Stockton High School, wrote to request
I the assistance of the commission in
| planting its High School park. Slips of
plants and young trees . were needed, I
; and from the nurseries at Golden Gate
I Park donations would be thankfully
; received by the citizens of the mill
. city. The request was referred to Su
j perintendent McLaren, with power to
'act.
; The Pacific Coast Forest, Fish and
: Game Association communicated a de
' sire for the support of the commission
! in the first forest, fish and game exhlbi
' tion, to be held in this city from Feb
ruary 21 to March 12 next. Received
! and filed. ;
! Representatives of the printing con-!
â  cern6 that have. r>ut in f bids for the ;
I right to produce the Park News were
I heard regarding their claims to do the ,
(work. The firm of Phillips, Smyth & i
I Van Orden has dissolved partnership,
â¢ Smyth withdrawing. The original firm
j was the highest bidder, and Quirk &
f Co., in the same building with .the firm
â¢ first mentioned, second highest! A con
troversy has arisen over charges
t brought by Smyth that there are too
[close relations between Quirk and his
i neighbors. Other bidders, including
(Smyth, who is now in business for
j himself, are anxious to submit figures.
An investigation of the claims and
i counter claims of interested persons
j will be made and all concerned will- be
â¢ heard at a special meeting of the board
to be held next Friday evening at 8
o'clock in a room on the half-floor of
the Palace Hotel.
DR. D'AN'COXA COMPLAINS.
Complaint by Dr! D'Ancona of the
use of the bicycle path -by pedestrians
will be referred to the park police, with
instructions to zmCa stop to the prac
tice.
Hugo Greenhood offered to lend the
museum a collection of 1000 coins for an
indefinite period. The matter was re
j ferred to Commissioner Cummings, with
power to act if the acceptance of the
I offer does not include the acceptance of
responsibility for the collection.
i The contract for furnishing 3600 feet
of i ten-inch castiron pipe for the new
reservoir near Strawberry Hill was. let
to the Crane Company at $40 per ton.
The other bidder was Christian Frolich,
f 43 48 per ton.
Superintendent McLaren will investi
gate the suggestion of persons living on
the park panhandle that two "conve
nience â¢ stations be .built on the pan
handle. â  The Commissioners favor one
The superintendent was instructed to
have made a foot path on â¢ the north
Bide of the south drive leading to
Strawberry Hill.
Employes of the museum were : or
dered to remove their exhibits of curios
from the : building, as ln N Commissioner
Cummings' belief they have been giv
ing too; much attention to their private
property and! somewhat neglecting the
city's exhibits.
Commissioner Lloyd presented ..the
museum .with -a -.set .'of .the new Philip
pine coins' that have just been turned
out of ; the Philadelphia ; mint and are
not yet in general circulation:
