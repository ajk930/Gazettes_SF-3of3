appeared off Port Arthur after daybreak to-day and engaged the
forts and warships. The fight is still proceeding. Thirty Japanese
prisoners have been captured.
At 1 o'clock this morning five . Japanese torpedo-boats were
sighted and the Russian land batteries and the gunboat Giliak and
the coast defense vessels Gremiashchi and Otvashni opened fire and
compelled them to retire. Immediately afterward other Japanese
ships were sighted on the horizon. They were headed by a fireship,
which' was sunk near the entrance of the harbor at 1 120 a. m..
IN ALL TEN FIKESHIPS AEE SUNK.
After an interval of twenty-five minutes two more fireships
came on and were sent to the bottom.
At 2 .2 5 o'clock four more fireships appeared. Three of these

were seen clinging to the masts and
funnels of: the" sunken vessels "and these
were rescued" by Â¦ the Russians.

factory and the basis of a settlement
which will preserve the peace of San
Francisco, the Interests of the public,
the rights and principles of the union
and of its members, and at the same
time will not injuriously affect the
self-administration of the company.
After a discussion and conference of
several hours the following basis upon
which adjustment may be made can be
effectuated:
I.
On the recognition of the union,
which is the main feature involved.
"(1) The company wil recognize
the union and will deal with it as fol
lows and as further provided in the
company's last offer.
."(2) The company will deal in all
matters of grievance affecting the
j union of any member of the. union di
j rectly with the duly accredited officers
! of the union.
i "(3) The company will not' dis
j charge or discriminate against any
member of the union because of his
union affiliation.'
"(4) The company will not dis
charge or discriminate against any
member of the union because of any
connection with or participation in
any of the discussions or differences
arising out of the present or any past
controversy between the company and
J the union to date of adjustment.
(5) The company will not directly or
indirectly interfere with or prevent the
joining of the union by any man em
ployed by the company after the date
of this agreement, and it will be en
tirely satisfactory to the company if
he should so Join.
"(6) When any member of the union
shall be discharged (except for failure
to register fares) the president of the^
union shall be notified and if, in the
opinion of the union the discharge is
unjust, the matter shall be taken up
with him and the member In question
by the officer of the company having
in charge the employment and dis
charge of men. If an agreement be
not reached by them the whole matter
shall b* referred to a committee of
the Board of Directors of the company
(Messrs. Holbrook and TV/bin) for final
action and the president of the
union and the members in question
*nay appear before such committee
and present such written testimony as
1 they may desire. The member In ques
tion, if the final decision shall be in
his favor, shall be restored to duty
and shall be paid for his lost time.
"(7.) The company states that It has
no desire to disrupt the union, dis
integrate it or deteriorate its strength,
and as a guaranty of its good faith
will make all its conditions binding
upon itself for one, two or three years,
so that peaceful conditions may pre
vail and no changes detrimental either
to the union or the company may be
made during that period.
"(S) Although the company claims
that its offer has lapsed it has now,
at mv solicitation, pending final
adjustment, agreed to hold the offer
open and in statu quo until Wednes
day, May 4, 1904, at 3 o'clock a. m.,
during which time all conditions shall
remain unchanged.
"(3) All other provisions of the
company's offer in the Interest of the
employes shall stand as presented, if
settlement is made.
"(10) Any difference as to the In
terpretation of the meaning of any
terms of the agreement between the
company and the men shall be deter
mined by a board of arbitration, con
sisting of one member selected by the
company, one by the union and one
by the two so selected.
, "(11) On the question of wages, the
company is fixed firm and will abso
lutely make no further con
cession. Under its offer, in a
short time, and while the pro
posed agreement is yet in force," all
men not now receiving 27% cents per
hour will have been granted that
amount, as In the offer stated.
"Assuming that the company will
act in good faith with the men, as I
have no doubt it will, especially upon
a better understanding between you
and it, and pledging to you my official
and personal support for the faithful
and honest execution by the company
of every one of {he conditions above
stated, should you accept the same as
the basis of continued peace, and
at the same time assuring the
company of your loyal and honest
purpose to carry out In good faith
your part of any agreement made, I
earnestly recommend to you, in the
interest of peace and by way of honor
able compromise, and without loss of
dignity or principle, the settlement of
all existing differences between your
selves and the company on the lines
bereinabove suggested, , invoking* and,
guaranteeing for such action on. your"
part the good will "and the friendly
feeling of all the people of San Fran
cisco, Irrespective of belief, class or
station. ', Very sincerely yours,
"E. E. SCHMITZ. Mayor of San
Francisco."
COMPANY'S CONCESSION.
The letter of the United Railroads to
the Mayor, referred to by him in his
report to the caVmen. is as follows:
"May 3, 1904.
"His Honor Eugene E. Schmitz,
"Mayor of San Francisco.
"Sir: We were notified by the Car
men's Union early on the morning of
May 1 that action had been deferred by
them â at your request â for three days.
We were requested, thereafter, by your
Honor to meet you in the matter.
"We feel it Incumbent upon us under
these circumstances not only to com- '
ply with your request, but to extend
our proposal to the men till 3 o'clock
on next Wednesday morning, in" the
meantime the status quo to be main
tained; and further, to emphasize our
attitude toward our employes we gladly
accept your suggestion that'the follow
ing words be embodied in our proposal,
constituting the fortieth and final
clause thereof:
" 'Section 40. The company fully rec
ognizes the* union, as provided in this
contract, and will not, directly or indi
rectly, interfere with or prevent the
joining of the union by any man em
ployed by the company after the date
of this agreement, and it will be en
tirely satisfactory to the company If he
should so join â the company will nel
| Iher discharge nor discriminate against
any employe because -of his connection
with the union, nor for any participa
tion in any Â«f the discussions or differ
ences arising out- of the present or any
past controversy between the company
and the union to the date of adjust
ment.
" 'When any member of the union
shall have been discharged (except for
failure to register fares) the president
of the union shall be notified and if
,in.the opinion of the union the dis
charge is unjust the matter shall be
taken up with him and the member
In question by the officers of the com
pany hiving in charge the employment
and discharge of men.'
"It is understood that one of the
terms of this extension and addition is
that the contract be for one, two. or
three years, as the union may elect
within the time above limited.
"Very respectfully, your obedient
servants,
"THE UNITED RAILROADS OF
SAN FRAXCISCO. By its executive
committee."
"Attest: GEO. B. WILLCUTT,
Secretary."
President Cornelius stated that the
city's executive would answer any
questions any member might desire to
put. Question upon question was pro
pounded to the Mayor and as quickly
answered. >^vv
President Mahon of the National As
sociation asked the May6r whether the
men could rely upon the promises made
by the company. Schmitz replied that
he believed they could, but in the event
of the company not standing â¢ by its
promise he would stand by the men.
Immediately following Mahon's query,
Cornelius took the floor and. made a
plea; for* the settlement of the difficul
ties. After some further discussion the
vote -was taken and the strike was off.
. /Those in favor of the first proposition
."were requested to rise to their feet.
lÂ£kn a great billow, human forms arose
, until but five or Fix remained seated.
. No actual count was necessary to de
termine the sentiments of the members
cf the urion, for the majority Â¦was so
overwhelming: as to leave no doubt as
to the mind of the carmen.
. ' MAYOR'S STATEMENT.
Mayor Schmitz made a strong plea to
the men to accept the company's terms.
.â¢He pictured the troubles which would
, fallow if a strike was declared and the
good which would be accomplished if a
. t-ottir-mr-ut whs reached. After the vote
had twn taken he made the following
â¢ statement:
"The strike" is averted. I congratu
late the p^opie of San Francisco on this
happy result, on the peaceful solution
of a strained industrial difference
which portended strife, misery and suf
. fering, and on the continuance of un
' checked tranquillity and prosperity.
"I thank the carmen for their good
sense, their conservative judgment and
their friendly feeling, and I wish also
tt>_ express my appreciation of the cour
tesy, affability and cool business ideas
of the officials of the United Railroads,
whfch made it possible to achieve the
object so much dosired and hoped fcrr
by all San Francisco â peace.
. "The position which I assumed by j
â¢my personal intervention atthelastmo
nient. when all hope of amicable ad
justment had fled and both sides were
. outspoken for bitter war, was a most
trying one; on either side apt to sub
ject me to misconstruction of motive
and on both sides likely to bring about
jlissatisf action with him who inter
bred in their private affairs without
being asked.
'.'I am pleased at the almost unani
mous support and encouragement of
the people and thank them sincerely
and from the bottom of my heart for
their sustaining good will. I deem it
my duty, however, to call especial at
tention of the public to the hypocriti
cal and lying statements made re
â¢ j*eatedly in certain quarters calculated
and designed, by misrepresentation
and false- statement, to incite the men
â¢ of -the union to strike and to plunge
â¢ the city into possible disorder, turbu
â¢ l^nre and riot, all for the gratifica
tion of party political revenge.
They should be denounced as enemies
of the republic and as traitors to the I
â¢ bejst interests of this city.
"If the carmen had believed the ac
counts of those papers no man can tell
upon what scenes to-morrow's sun
would have risen." Â»>.
MAYORS REPORT.
It had br-en expected in the early
..part of the evening that a secret ballot
would be taken, and with that end in
view seventy-five membere were ap
pointed to pass around Blips of paper
upon which were to be written the sim
ple words "yes" or "no." Thirty mem
bers were appointed to act as tellers
and. count the vote as rapidly as pos
sible. The final result, however, pre
cluded the necessity of any such action.
During the early stages of the meet-
Ing Mayor Schmitz presented his re
port as follows:
To the officers and members of the
Amalgamated Association of s. and
E. Railway Employes of San Fran
cisco, Division Xo. 205:
Gentlemenâ Believing, . from ex
perience and information, that the
extremely grave crisis now existing in
the relations between yourselves and
the company was, in all probability,
largely induced by the suspicion and
doubt of either side as to the abiding
good faith of the other in the various
negotiations, and fearing that what
e\ er - good Intention or good feeling
cither party might have entertained
toward the other may have been Jeop
ardized and perhaps destroyed by such
suspicion and by a common misunder
standing. I have sought to obtain
a declaration in good faith of the com
pany's attitude toward Its men and to
ward the union, for the future as well
as for the present, and I truly believe
that I have succeeded in securing terms
end agreements which should, under
'* There will be no strike of the Carmen's Union, and the differences between the company
and ;ts.employes are settled for one year. By almost a unanimous vote the members of the union
decided at 2 no o'clock this morning to accept the terms of the company.
This result of the pending trouble was brought about by Mayor Schmitz pleading with the
men to accept the terms of the company, and, in order that the 2000 car operators assembled might
thoroughly understand every question pertaining to the matters at issue, he read a typewritten state
ment of his conference with the railroad officials and their reply.
Following the reading of that report Mayor Schmitz endeavored to show to the men the
troubles which would ensue in the event of a strike being declared and pleaded with them again to
accept the company's offer and sign the agreement. President Cornelius followed Mayor Schmitz
practically along the same lines and before Mahon of the national organization could secure the
. floor the question was put to strike or not to strike.
Decision to Accept the Proposition Submitted
by the Company Is Almost Unanimous.

NEWCHWANG ATTACKED AND CAPTURED BY JAPANESE
CARMEN, BY A BIG MAJORITY, VOTE NOT TO STRIKE
By a rising vote at 2:10 o'clock this morning the Carmen's Union decided not to strike and to accept the terms of the company, which includes a signed agreement covering a period of one year.
More than the two-thirds majority to decide the question was counted when the delegates rose to their feet.. Cheer upon cheer echoed through the Alhambra, Theater when the final announcement was made
from the stage and the men that had brought the final issue about left the hall laughing and rejoicing. The opponents of the company say they were "jobbed" by Cornelius and threats were made that the
present president will be removed before the year is out. The few disgruntled members attempted to hold a meeting afterward," but there was so much opposition that nothing could be done.

PORT ARTHUR. May 3.^-At a few
minutes before 1 o'clock this morning
the fort'a guns awakened the town
with their thunderous noise. The gun
boats lying at the -mouth of the har
bor Joined In the cannonade of the
batteries, the firing gradually -increas
ing in volume until there was a con
tinuous crash of great guns. 1 - Some of
the enemy's torpedo-boats were dis
covered, but they were finally swal
lowed up in the darkness, and the bat
teries and warships, after forty min
utes' activity, were again shrouded in
gloom, though the flashing search
lights showed that the military were
alive to the warning conveyed of the
approach of the Japanese ships.
Shortly before 2 o'clock a search
light played from the sea directly upon
the entrance of the harbor, lighting it
up to show the way for the fireships.
The projector moved to the right from
Liaotishan to Golden Hill. For a quar
ter of an hour the light was watched
with curiosity, and then a second can
nonade began, the heaviest fire being
directed to the left of Golden Hill,
where the fireships were located.
At about 4 o'clock the batteries
ceased firing save for an occasional
shot. â¢
Just before dawn the bark of the
rapid-fire guns and the crackling of the
mitrailleuse was heard from Golden
Hill. Occasionally there were sound3
of explosions, as of mines going off. It
was the enemy's ships striking on Rus
sian torpedoes.
At this hour a magnificent sea pic
ture was formed by the soft light of
the waning moon, the orange flashes
of the guns, the signal rockets and the
purple fires on the steel-colored sea,
which were alternately lighting up and
dying out.
The fireships were ten in number and
of about 2000 tons.
It is reported that two Japanese tor
pedo-boats were sunk, the remainder
withdrawing In a damaged condition.
Eight fireships were sunk and very
few members of their crews were saved.
Most of them were killed. â¢ â¢ â¢ '
In the morning many bodies were
seen floating about outstde the harbor.
These were collected by the Russians,
who brought them ashore and burled
them.
The vigilance of the men In the watch
towers and in the guardboats was as
tonishing. To their keen eyes was due
the prompt sighting of the enemy. \
The Russians captured two officers
and thirty men.
It is reported that twelve ships had
been prepared by the Japanese, but for
some unknown reason two of them
never attempted to approach the en
trance.
It Is said the crews of the fireships
included a number of Japanese cadets,
who showed extraordinary bravery, es
pecially when the ships were sinking.
Several of the crew . sat on the top
masts, .firing revolvers, Â¦ and then
plunged Into the Â¦ sea. It Is believed
that none of the cadets were saved. ,
The attempt to close the mouth of
the harbor failed.

CALL BUREAU.. HOTEL BARTON.
"WASHINGTON, May 3.â News of the
reported fall of Newchwang was re
ceived tÂ«>-nfffht with intense -surprise
by Government officials and military
ro'en. The Russian Embassy and the
Japanese Legation anxiously await
confirmation of the Japanese victory,
vhich. if it is as complete as stated,
will take its place as the most signal
advantage attained by either side since
tfte defeat of the Russian .fleet at Port
Arthur. Further details are required
by military experts before they will
attempt to discuss the strategy In ex
t^nso, but the possession of New
chwang by the Japanese is generally
Yakrn to mean an early attack upon
Port Arthur. A military officer, who
cannot be quoted on account of his
position, said to-cight:
"We had been lÂ«Â»d to believe that
Huspia had a strong force In and near
Newchwang. That the Japanese could
have reduced the city so quickly seems
almost incomprehensible. The channel
"between Yinkow and Newchwang was
thoroughly mined.
' "With the Japanese in possession of
Newchwang. the Russian forces driven
t;i< k from the Yalu two days ago are
taken in the rear, while Port Arthur
tor the first time is eeriously menaced
from the land side. Japanese occupa
tion of Newchwang means that the
Mikado's soldiers have a base not only
on the Yalu, but also at the head of the
ijrulf of Llaotung. With the Japanese
fleet j-trong enough to keep the Rus
sian fleet bottled up in Port Arthur,
there is nothing to prevent the landing
fif -trar>5ports and supplies at New
rhwang, which is connected by a short
railroad spur with the Port Arthur
branch of the Siberian Railroad. The
cutting of the railroad would seem to
be an easy tas k, for it is not to be be
lieved'that the Japanese would or
could have reduced Newchwang with
out sufficient force to hold it against
almost any force which can be Imme
diately sent against them from the
nortfi.
"â¢â¢The Russians cannot tell whether
General Kuroki. the victor of Sunday,
will turn toward Vladivostok or toward
Pt-rt Arthur. Before the report that
Newghwang had fallen came, I would
have taid it was up to the Russians
to dislodge the Japanese from their po-
Fition on the Yalu, even though they
had to fight on ground chosen by the
Â¦Japanese. But now, if the Russian
force is menaced in the rear from New
chwang, it is another and more serious
question.
"We have been informed that at least
100,000 Japanese troops had been land
.ed in Korea, but only 15,000 were ac
counted for in the engagement on the
Yalu. We had not hitherto been able
to find out where the great portion of
the remainder were. It wo-uld seem
â¢ they were being held for an expedition
against Newchwang."

LOXDON, May 4. â The Russian of
ficial dispatches display the customary
candor In fully confirming the disas
trous nature of the rout sustained on
the Yalu. To the Russian official
frankness in this respect Is attributed
the belief of the Russian people that
initial reverses are of no consequence
and that eventually triumph is inev
itable.
A special dispatch from St. Peters
burg asserts that Lieutenant General
Zassulitch fell Into an ambush owing
to the Japanese Interrupting a tele
gram from General Kurapatkin. Â»_
According to the Standard's St. "
Petersburg correspondent General
Kuropatkin Is recalling all the troopa
from the neighborhood of Gensan. He
Is opposed, the correspondent say3. to
fighting many minor actions, and In
tends to withdraw all outlying Russian
forces-
The Standard's Shanghai corre
spondent says that before evacuating
Antung. the Russians expelled the
population by force. He adds that
the Peking Government has refused
General Ma's request to be permitted
to expel the Russian troops from west
of the LJao River.
The correspondent at Shanghai of
the Daily Telegraph says It Is under
stood all non-combatants have left and
all official documents and valuables
have been removed from Dalny, and
that all guns from the disabled war
ships at Port Arthur have been taken
ashore to the forts.
ST. PETERSBURG. May 4. 6:03
a. m. â St. Petersburg is electrified by
the sensational news of fighting on
land and sea.
Yesterday was a day of anxiety and
excitement among all classes of peo
ple, from the Emperor in the palace
to the lowest moujik standing be
fore the bulletin boards eagerly lis
tening to the dispatches as they were
read by educated persona in the
crowd.
Important as was Alexieff'a
achievement, in spite of the magni
tude of the attempt of the Japanese,
who this time sent in ten flreships to
block the Port Arthur entrance. It is
dwarfed by the details of the fighting
on the Yalu showing the severe losses
suffered by the Russians, who have
removed 800 wounded alone to Feng
wangcheng, while it Is estimated by
General Kuropatkin that the Japan
ese loss is between 3000 and 4000.
If this statement of the Japanese
loss is correct, the Russian authorities
say, General Zassulitch must be given
credit for carrying out that part of his
orders, to make the crossing of the
Yalu as costly as possible to the enemy.
Zassulitch had only 10.000. of whom
2000 were unable to participate In the
fighting. The Japanese had from 35,000
to 40,000 men, besides the greater quan
tity of guns, many of them being of
heavier caliber than those of the Rus
sians.
ODDS ARE FIVE TO ONE.
Thus outnumbered, the Russians
actually engaging more than five to
one, the Japanese did succeed in flank
ing two Russian battalions on both
sides and enveloping them in the rear.
The latter, with music playing and
with fixed bayonets, a priest holding
aloft a cross, charged and the Japan
ese opened before them, after which
they succeeded in reaching the sup
ports.
It was one of the most gallant ac
tions of a bloody day. It is regretted
both In military and church circles that
the priest was severely wounded.
No such determined stand as that
made by the troops was intended by
General Kuropatkin, but their tenacity
in holding their position, it is said, is
worthy of the highest tradition of the
Russian army. , â¢
It Is a cause of satisfaction to the
authorities that in spite of the severe
Russian loss General Zassulitch had
sufficient strength to sharply bite the
pursuing enemy, who lost 300 in this
movement alone.
JAPANESE ARE HURLED BACK.
The opinion here is that the rear
guard movement was one of the mo3t
dramatic bits of fighting during the
battle. Three times the. Russians halted
and twice the Mikado's cavalry were
hurled back, only to come again. The
third repulse sickened the fighting
stomach of the assailants, who aband
oned the effort to completely crush th<?
retreating force. â¢ . .
The general staff does not expect an
immediate forward movement of the
Japanese, but the latter are preparing
the way for an advance, as is shown
by the appearance of a cavalry detach
ment to the southeast of \ Fengwang
cheng.
The retirement of the detachment
when sighted by a Russian force indi
cated simply that it was scouting in
order to locate the next point where
resistance may be looked for.
The press is Informed by the general
staff that Major General Kashtlllnsky
is alive and that Lieutenant General
Zassulitch was not wounded, but that
the colonels, lieutenant colonels and a
majority of the men of the Twelfth and
Twenty-second regiments were either

Ing to-day.
"After 4 o'clock a. m. the batteries
and warships ceased firing, subsequent
ly firing only at intervals on the
enemy's torpedo-boats, which were vis
ible on the horizon. All of the fireships
carried quick-firing guns, with which
they maintained a constant flre.
"Up to the present twenty men, in
cluding two mortally wounded officers,
who took refuge on a launch or were
rescued from the flreshlps by us, have
been picked up. The inspection of .the
roadstead and the work. of saving the
enemy's men were hindered by tlvj
heavy sea running. We suffered no
casualties, with the exception of a sea
man belonging to a torpedo-boat de
stroyer.
"On the first appearance of the first
fireship, accompanied by the enemy'a
torpedo-boats, I boarded a launch and
proceeded with the Otvcshni to take
immediate measures for repulsing the
fireships."
"Altogether eight ships were sunk
by our vigorous cannonade, by White
head torpedoes launched from our tor
pedo-boats and by the explosion of sev
eral Fubmarine mines. Further, ac
cording to the report of< the offlpers
commanding the batteries, two Japan
ese torpedo-boats were destroyed.
TWO TORPEDO-BOATS SUNK.
"At 1:45 o'clock the first flreshlps,
escorted by several torpedo-boats, were
sighted and we opened fire upon them
from the batteries and the warships.
Three-quarters of an hour afterward
our searchlights reveaJed a number of
fireships making for the entrance of
the harbor from the east and south
west. The coast defense vessels Ot
vashnl and Gremlashchl and the gun
boat Giliak repulsed them by a well
directed 'fire.
ST. PETERSBURG, May 3.â High
Admiral Grand Duke Alexis has re
ceived the following official telegram
from Viceroy Alexieff, reporting the
Japanese attempt to blockade Port Ar
thur early this morning.
"I respectfully report to your High
ness tha^ a fresh attack was made by
the enemy last night with the object
of obstructing the entrance to the port
and that it was successfully repelled.
"At 1 o'clock this morning five tor
pedo-boats were seen near the coast
from the eastern batteries. Under the
flre of our warships and batteries they
retreated southward.
" 'Japanese cavalry appeared to the
southeast of Fengwangcheng. but see-
Ing two companies with two guns op
posed to it It did not venture to ap
proach.
" 'The transportation of the wounded
by hired Chinese bearers to Fengwang
cheng was very difficult. Two-wheeled
carts and horses lent by the cavalry
also were utilized for this purpose. Most
of the wounded, however, arrived on
foot, assisted by their comrades, and
reached Fengwangcheng within twen
ty-four hours.'
"Lieutenant General Zassulitch de
clares that the troops retained their
morale notwithstanding the heavy
losses, and are ready for fresh engage
ments.
"The Japanese losses were very heavy
at the passage of the Aho River, at
their position at Kuliencheng and on the
hill occupied by the two battalions of
the Eleventh Regiment. According to
the statements of participants In the
battle at least 3000 or 4000 were killed."
" 'Up to the present 800 wounded, in
cluding fourteen officers, have been
brought to the hospital at Fengwang
cheng. Their eventual transportation
elsewhere is assured.
EIGHT HUNDRED WOUNDED.
" 'In front of the regiment a chaplain
bearing a. cross was struck by two bul
lets. ' -
" 'It was only by advancing on the
Japanese with the bayonet that the
Seventh Regiment was able to retire.
" 'On the arrival of the battalion of
the Tenth Regiment all the troops were
able to beat the retreat.
" 'The losses of the Eleventh and
Twelfth regiments were very great, but
they are not yet exactly known. In
the Eleventh the killed included Colonel
Laming and Lieutenant Colonels Do
mettl and .Ralevski. The Twelfth lost
nine company commanders killed and
wounded.
" 'The second and third batteries of
the Sixth Brigade, having lost the
greater number, of their men and
horses, were compelled to abandon
their guns after rendering them use
less. For the same reason the six guns
of the third battery of the Third Bri
gade of artillery and eight poulemets,
which could not be brought away, were
also disabled. The mountainous nature
of the country made It impossible to
save the guns by means of drag ropes.
".'A battalion of the Eleventh Regi
ment, both flanks of which were re
peatedly turned by the .enemy, ad
vanced with fixed bayonets, preceded
by buglers, to clear a passage. * The
Japanese, however, declined a hand
to-hand conflict and recoiled.
RUSSIANS USE BAYONETS.
"'Finally, all of the supports were
brought ud Into- the firing line, but
owing to the great distance from our
main reserve, it was impossible for them
to reach the advanced force 'in time
and our men retired from the prin
cipal position., lo another . position . in
the' rear of Kuliencheng, followed by
the concentrated fire of the Japanese,
who could not make up their minds to
descend from the crest they occupied
and face the fire of our batteries and
poulemets. They dug fresh trenches
and opened a heavy 'artillery fire on
our position and began to turn our left
flank toward Chingow.
""'Two battalions of the Eleventh
Regiment and the third battery of the
Third Brigade of artillery, belonging
to the main reserve, were ordered to
Laof unhou. â¢ They occupied a position
with a double firing line, thus permit
ting our advanced line, which had suf
fered heavily, and our wounded, to re
tire.
Our reserves several times mingled
with the first line, thus enablins It
for a long time to maintain its posi
tion. ~ - '

south coast of Korea, have demanded
the removal of their prefect, Hung

ment as a reward for the murder In
a. hotel in Shanghai In 1894 of Kim Ok

PROGRESS ON RAILRAOD.
SEOUL, Korea, Monday, May 2â (de
layed in transmission).â The Russian
troops fled panic-stricken, when routed
from Kuliencheng, pursued by Japa
nese cavalry and infantry over the hill
country toward Fengwangcheng from
1:50 p. m. until 8 o'clock at night The
wounded, including General in Chief
Zassulitch and General Kashtalinsky,
reached Antung, whence the Russians
were eventually forced to retire, after
twenty-five minutes' fierce fighting.
SEOUL. Korea, Saturday, April 30
(decayed in transmission). â The activ
ity of the Russians in the province of
North Hyonghong, Korea, continues.
Five hundred Cossacks are reported to
have advanced to Kilju, a town on
the coast about 170 miles north of
Gensan, and a second party, number
ing 240 men, is twenty miles behind
the first. It is said that the Koreans
are repairing roads to facilitate the
movement of the Russians.
SEOUL. Korea, Friday, April 29 (de
layed in transmission).â During the
past three weeks there has been much
local political ferment in palace circles,
and the changes In the ministry have
been frequent. Four Ministers of For
eign Affairs have been appointed only
to resign at once, and other portfolios
have been taken up, relinquished and
are still vacant.
SEOUL, May 3 (3 p. m.).â In the fight
ing on the Yalu all the Russian guns
posted to oppose the crossing of the
river were put out of action before the
actual crossing took place. For two
hours, from 7 until 9 o'clock, continu
ous fighting went on, the Japanese
steadily pressing forward and the Rus
sians falling back before the weight of
men and guns opposed to them.
The Japanese, infantry with a bril
liant dash captured the fortified heights
northwest of Kuliencheng, and the
pressure was kept up until after noon,
a portion of the Russian forces beins
driven toward Antung. There was
furious fighting the entire distance.
At Antung the Russians found that
in addition to the force confronting
them they were threatened by strong
detachments on either flank. Their re
treat then became so hurried that there
was no time to replace the artillery
horses shot down by the Japanese
sharpshooters, and twenty guns, to
gether with a large quantity of ammu
nition and rifles end a: number , of of
ficers-and men, -were captured. The
Russians were able to carry off all their
wounded.
PAXIC-STRICKEX FLIGHT.
INFANTRY'S BRILLIANT DASH.
The Japanese residents of Seoul are
preparing to hold an impressive memo
rial service In honor of those of their
countrymen who have fallen in battle,
and also a great celebration commem
orating the victories attained by the
Japanese arms, to be held on May 6.
SEOUL, Korea, May 3.â Later reports
of the Russian reverse on the Yalu are
to the effect that the Japanese captured
twenty-eight small rapid-fire guns.'be
sides twenty field guns. They also cap
tured thirty Russian officers and more
than 500 men, many" of whom "were
found hiding in the underbrush by
Japanese searching parties.
Cossack officers who were captured
place the number of Russians killed
and wounded at 800, but it is believed
that this understates the Russian loss,
which is considered to be very much
greater.
The Japanese army is resting, bury
ing Its dead and caring for its wound
ed. The Japanese thoroughly occupy
the area over which the fighting ex
tended, and are now scouting the hilly
country to which the Russian forces
retired.
The Emperor is understood to be
greatly grieved over the losses sus
tained on the Yalu River. Those who
have seen his Majesty say that he was
dumfounded when he was informed
of the heavy fighting which attended
the passage of the river. As is well
understood here, General Kuropatkin's
programme did not contemplate such
resistance to the Japanese advance. It
is said, moreover, that Kuropatkin
himself was equally surprised and so
chagrined over the miscarriage of his
plans that he sent his first telegram
to the general staff and not direct to
the Emperor. The understanding here
is that General Zassulitch had specific
orders to avoid anything like a gen
eral engagement, and it is believed
that the Russian commander at the
front probably was deceived in his
estimate of the strength of General
Kuroki's artillery, being in entire ig
norance that 4.2 guns had been posted,
and got into a position from which he
had the greatest difficulty in extricat
ing his men. The only consolation for
the loss of the Russian guns is that,
being without their breech locks, they
are of no value to the enemy.
It is admitted by the general staff
that the Japanese flanking move af
fected the whole of the twelve battal
ions and three batteries at Kulien
cheng and Litzavla, which accounts
for the desperate fighting. The Twelfth
and Twenty-second regiments suffered
the most. A great number of officers
were killed or wounded and the gun
ners of the captured pieces were either
killed, wounded or made prisoner. One
battery had every man killed.
Batteries of Russian artillery have
226 men in war time, horse mountain
batteries have 245 men and Cossa'ck
artillery batteries have from 245 to 324
men.
MANY OFFICERS KILLED.
According to information" Just ob
tained from the general staff, Zassu
litch's entire force at the Yalu con
sisted of fifteen rifle battalions of VÂ£00
men and five batteries of forty guns.
One regiment, of three battalions and
two batteries stationed at Antung did
not participate in Sunday's fighting
and retired without loss.
The heights of Kuliencheng and Ko
san were held by four regiments and
four batteries, about 10,000 men. and
thirty-two guns, against 80,000 Japan
ese and 160 guns, in addition to sixteen
twelve-pounder siege guns landed from
the gunboats. These guns are consider
ed by the Russians to Have been re
sponsible for General Zassulitch's de
feat, as the Russian guns were of a
light field pattern, with some mountain
pieces.
The general staff asserts that General
Zassulitch had no reserves nearer than
Fengwangcheng. Reserves, it is add
ed, were unnecessary, as General Zas*
sulitch'e mission was only to observe
and harass, but not impede the Japan
ese.
"It is like General Kurokl's luck that
General Zassulitch should be such a
headstrong commander," said an offi
cer.
Another official report from General
Kcrcrpatkin, dated May 2, says Gen
eral Zassulitch's force retreated in
good order, eventually arriving at
Fengwangcheng. He attributes the
losses on the Yalu to the superiority
of the Japanese artillery. The num
ber of casualties or of the guns lost
is not specified by General Zassu
litch.
"Although we were unable to hold
our position here, we inflicted heavy
losses on the enemv."
RETREAT OP ZASSULITCH.
ST. PETERSBURG, Hay 3. â It. is
now admitted here that both General
Zassulitch and Katchalinsky were
wounded and that twenty-seven {runs
were captured by the Japanese during:
the recent fighting- on the Yalu River.
The Emperor to-day received an
official dispatch from General Kuro
patkin forwarding a dispatch from
General Zassulitch. It is dated "noon,
Sunday," and describes how he or
dered the Russian forces at Antung
and Kuliencheng to fall back along
the main road toward Fengwang
cheng.
This movement was protected from
the threatened flank attack by men
and guns stationed at Potitiensky, on-s
mile north of Kuliencheng, and at
Chingow. villages on the Litzavla Riv
er. Here the figSting was protracted
and severe. The Russians lost arttl
lery and horses, being obliged to aban
don, according: to the text, a "few"
guns. General Zassulitch says:

would riot give the exact number of
these, nor would he give any estimate
of the percentage of cars the company
expected to operate In the morning in
case its present employes voted to quit
their employment.
MAHON VISITS SCH3UTZ.
At union headquarters there was an
absolute calm until after the noon hour.
Several prominent members of the ex
ecutive committee, including President
Cornelius and Secretary Bowling, spent
the morning at headquarters. When
Mayor Schmitz had finished his confer
ence with President Holland he went to
his office and telephoned to Interna
tional President Mahon of the union
that he wished to see him. Mahon
went to the City Hall and was closeted
with the Mayor for more than an hour.
When he returned to headquarters he
said that there was nothing to make
public until he had received a prom
ised statement from the United Rail
roads. This was not delivered to Ma
hon until nearly 7 o'clock, but as he
knew Its general purport he went into
a consultation with the members of the
executive committee and "outlined to
them the result of Mayor Schmitz's ef
forts to prevent a strike.
' Mayor Schmitz said he was worn out
after his labors in conference. When
asked what the result had been he said:
â¢ "The United Railroads is haggling
over one little point, but I still con
tinue to hope that a peaceable solution
of the pending difficulties may be had.
That is all I care 'to say at present."
MEN ABOARD SHIP.
The officials of the union'are In pos
session of information that 600 men re
cruited during the last few weeks by
the United Railroads are on board a
ship anchored somewhere in the bay.
The name of the ship and its location
they profess not to know. < The Infor
mation was gfVen them by a couple of
union men who accompanied a party
of thirty employed by the agents of
the company in Portland and who were
brought to this city. The men were
taken to the Vallejo street wharf* and
put in a launch. They were told that
there were 600 men already aboard a
ship in the bay and that there, were
accommodations for 1500, with plenty
of provisions. The union men left the
party at the wharf and reported their
findings to headquarters.
Some days ago it was officially given
out by the union that in the event the
men voted to strike every member of
the. organization In good standing
would, receive an_ allowance of $10 a
week as long as he was out of employ
ment. This assurance was Indorsed by
Mahon on behalf of the International
body.
Federal Commissioner Heacock held i
spelling and writing school again yes- j
terday, with Henry P. Dimond, one of;
the defendants in the land frauds case, j
as the star pupil. Dimond not only \
produced a dozen additional exemplars j
of his penmanship, but had an oppor- j
tunlty to show that he was a better j
speller than the writer of the anonym- Â¦
ous letters. His errors in orthography, i
such as those reported exclusively in I
yesterday's Call, promise to become of â¢
vital moment, both in this preliminary j
hearing and in the trial of the alleged !
conspirators if they are held for trial.
The Government claims that of them- j
selves, without other evidence, the j
mistakes in spelling are sufficient to .
convict Dimond of the authorship of i
the anonymous epistles. On the other
hand, his counsel have declared their
willingness to rest the entire question
of his guilt or innocence under the In
dictment upon their ability to prove he
did not write the letters.
The >day opened with a move by
counsel for Dimond's codefendant and
former client, Fred A. Hyde. Schles
inger offered in evidence certified copies
of the deeds and other documents af
fecting Hyde's title to the lands cov
ered by the thirty-four counts of the
indictment.
DIMOND SHOWS THE STRAIN.
Then Dlmond was recalled by Heney
for further cross-examination and told
to take paper and write from dictation.
The Federal attorney read passage
after passage from one or another of
the anonymous letters, and the wit
ness, first with his right hand and then
with his left, now with a pen and now
with a pencil, wrote them down In
script or laboriously printed them out.
In capitals, as directed. It was a te
dious process and occupied nearly the
entire day, at the end of which Dl
mond declared himself exhausted" with
the long ordeal.
In obtaining so many examples of the
defendant's penmanship Heney admits
that he is preparing for the testimony
of handwriting experts upon the trial
of the case at Washington. He claims
that Dimond's writing when upon the
witness stand, although studiously dis
guised, will show many of the charac
teristics of pen printing used in the
anonymous letter senÂ± to the Secretary
of the Interior. Besides the handwrit
ing test, Dimond's mistakes in spelling
have been identical with those made
in that and the other anonymous com
munications. In addition to those al
ready reported in The Call he made
others yesterday. The anonymous
writer in advising the Secretary to in
vestigate certain of Hyde's Heu land
selections wrote XIIII instead of the
correct Roman numeral XIV, and
XVIIII instead of XIX. In writing
from Heney's dictation Dlmond com
mitted the same errors. One of the
anonymous typewritten letters to De
tective Burns contained the phrase,
".The picture man has squeeled." Dl
mond yesterday misspelled "squealed"
In the same way.
WHAT. HYDE THINKS.
On the other hand, a number of the
words misspelled in the Town Talk
letter were given him in the sentences
dictated by Heney, and the witness
wrote them correctly. , #
Heney offered in evidence a number
of Dimond's Washington docket slips,
on which were many printed words ad
mittedly from the defendant's pen or
pencil. In these letters O, R, D and S
are Invariably made with well-rounded
curves. In his pen printing in court
mond has insisted that he always
prints a block letter, and has stead
fastly adhered to that form In his ex
emplars, making the letters named
with square corners and no curves.
Then, too, he has been careful with his
E's and F's, closing all the "Joints." In
the docket slips, as Heney pointed out,
these letters are irregular, often open
at the joints, just as are the E's and
F's of the anonymous pen printed let
ter, to the Secretary.
The case will continue this morning.
SCENE AT LAND FRAUDS HEARING; ALSO EXAMPLES SHOWING DIFFER
ENCES BETWEEN DIMOND'S LETTERING IN COURT. AND THAT ON HIS
LEGAL PAPERS WITH LETTERS FROM UNSIGNED COMMUNICATION.
According to Mahon, the question
as to how long the agreement is to
run is still open. According to Cor
nelius the question has been settled
for one year. Mahon maintains that
the company presented its terms on
the ground that they were to be in
force for three years.
While the carmen who were off duty
were discussing the latest unofficial
conditions, their attention was attract
ed to the appearance of a young man
who insisted upon seeing President
Cornelius at once. When the guard
asked his business he stated he was
from the Electric Linemen's Union No.
151 and had an important message for
the president of the Carmen's Union
relative to a matter he had learned
during the night. He was admitted at
once to the executive room and tofd
his story. Within five minutes he re
turned to the lower floor and made
rapid time to the street without vouch
safing any statement of the object of
his visit or the nature of the message
he conveyed.
COMPANY'S \LAST OFFER.
One other matter the company con
ceded was a paragraph to be Inserted
as section No. 40, whereby the com
pany agrees to the provisions of the
agreement submitted by the union in
section No. 39, which provides that no
man shall be discharged for participa
tion in this controversy, up to the time
of the present trouble, nor will they
put any obstacles in the way of new
men joining the union. In the event
of any man beinj discharged for any
cause, except for peculation, he shall
have the right of hearing before the
employing officer, but men discharged
for "knocking down" do not have tfie
right. Should the union accept t\e
company's offer an agreement for three
years must be signed.
The next to the last sentence was
the last straw on the weight being car
ried by the executive committee and at
midnight a vote was taken by the
thirty-two members as to whether the
company's terms should be accepted
or not. The result showed four In
favor of accepting the term's of the
company and twenty-four against.
That action of the committee was
submitted to the meeting of the union
at the Alhambra. Theater at 2 o'clock,
at which time the vote was taken.
' CONFERENCE IS BARRED.
PREPARE FOR STRIKE.
It was apparent early in the day
that the conference between the com
pany officials and the .Mayor had been
practically barren of result. Minor
points had been talked over and meth
ods of settlement upon these were pro
posed that would have probably met
the views of the executive committee of
the union.
The rock uoon which President Hol
land of the United Railroads stood
firmly was the main contention in the
present issue â the right of the company
to hire and discharge its employes
without reference to the fact of wheth
er or not they belong to the union.
President Holland positively declined to
entertain any change in the stand of
the company on this proposition. He
said that the company was willing to
give full recognition to the union and
willing to treat > with its members
through their representatives on any
differences that migh^ arise between
them and their employer, but he could
not and would'not permit the organiza
tion to dictate to the company what
men it should employ.
Both sides were confident that the
intervention of* Mayor Schmitz would
alter the situation in no way, and both
continued their preparations . for the
promised struggle. All day and evening
the corridors of the _ eighth flooc of the
Rialto building were : filled with men
seeking employment from the United
Railroads in the event of a strike. For
the most part they were a well-looking
set of men and generally fairly dressed.
Those seeking employment were ad
mitted one by one into the room where
the examination, was being held. Most
of the day General Manager Chapman
personally supervised the ; hiring of the
new men: He stated that a consider
able number of skilled operators on
cars applied for work", with excellent
credentials and were assigned to vari-
PARIS, Mav 3.^-Having wound up
the details -of 'the big financial trans
action connected with the Panama
canal transfer, J. P. Morgan left Paris
to-day for Aix-les-Balns. Before his
departure he gave to tbe press the
main points of the final agreement, as
follows:
The Panama Canal Company wished
to have the money turned over in
Paris instead of in the United States,
and was willing to pay all the expenses
incident to the payment here. In or
der to accomplish this the United
States has appointed the Morgan Com
pany fiscal agents for the purpose of
the payment, the Morgan Company in
turn to make a contract with the
Panama Canal Company whereby the
$40,000,000 will be paid in Paris.
The contract specifies the Banque de
France as depository, and also the pro
portion of the payments, going to the
old and new Panama companies, re
spectively. The signing of this cono
tract closes the transaction, it only re
maining for the Morgan Company to
carry it out by making payments from
time to time to the Banque de France.
This will be done so as to cause no
disarrangement of the American or
French money markets.
The report that a syndicate of Paris
bankers is interested is incorrect.

several controversies with officials in
Washington. He has been on the re
tired list for many years.
. At the War Department it was said
this afternoon that Captain Walker's
charges were "flighty"; that they in
no 'way reflected upon Colonel Mills'
character.
Captain Walker recites that he was
harshly treated by Colonel Mills
while visiting^ West Point. Colonel
Mills, to whom the charges were for
warded, has replied stating that he
considers his drastic treatment of
Captain Walker thoroughly merited
by the latter's conduct* toward a lady
at West Point.
WASHINGTON. May 3. â Charges
of "brutal and tyrannical conduct"
have been preferred, at the War De
partment against Colonel Albert L.
Mills, superintendent of the United
States Military Academy at West
Point, by Captain John P. Walker,
United States army, retired, who lives
in Washington.

INDIANAPOLIS, May 3. â The most
bitter fight in the history of Vander
burgh County between political fac
tions culminated to-day in the election
of two sets of delegates to the Demo
cratic State Conventionâ one set for
Parker and the other for Hearst â both
claiming regularity.
For several days the Parker people
have charged the Hearst crowd with
spending money to control the con
vention. When the convention met
both Hearst and Parker men put up
candidates for chairman and when the
Parker man was declared elected th*
Hearst faction asserted that their can
didate had the larger vote and both
candidates mounted the platform.
Each faction presented its slate of
delegates and each chairman declared
the one presented by his faction was
elected. Thus both conventions were
held in the same hall and at the same
hour, but the Parker delegates re
ceived the credentials and the Hearst
men will attend the convention as a
contesting delegation.

â¢ . ... .
WASHINGTON. May 3.â The plat
form to be adopted by, the RÂ«?publican
National Convention has been among
the tonics discussed at the conferences
Which have taken place recently at the
>â¢ White House, in committee rooms at the
CaVltol and at different residences
.â¢where a number of Republicans have
â¢'bten assembled. Senator Lodge, who
. is slated for chairman of the commit
tee on resolutions in the convention,
has prepared preliminary sketches of
various topics that he thinks should be
treated and has submitted them to
Senators and ethers for their approval
or suggestion as to amendment. It is
eipected that before the convention
meets a complete platform will be pre
~paiÂ«^d, which will have the approval of
th.e President.
The principal feature of the platform
will be the tariff plank, which will de
- clare in the strongest terms the adher
ence of the Kepublican party to the i
I-'finciple of protection, but will not
bind the party not to revise the tariff. J
, It will say that the party is not com- j
â¢mitted to any schedule, but that!
jhanges ehouid be made only when j
(.hanged conditions of business or the {
â¢treasury render it necessary or ad
visable. Persons present at the recent j
conferences say it already has been i
agreed that the tariff will -be revised In j
: the. Fifty-ninth Congress If the Repub- j
licans crin in November.
IXDORSEMKXT PLAXK.
There is at present a determination j
to make the platform as brief as possi- j
"t$!e, consequently the indorsement of j
the administration and the acts of the i
party will be put into compact form, j
This indorsement will be a general ap- i
proval of the general action of the j
President and the Republicans.
The pl&r.k concerning trusts will, in
effect, declare that the laws for the J
regulation of monopolies and the re- j
etraint of conspiracy against commerce |
Â¦were enacted by the Republicans and j
that the enforcement of such laws has
'been only by a Republican administra
tion. It will also say that it is not the
policy or intention of the Republican
party to assail legitimate industry and
business or to infringe on the rights of
persons or property. Special attention
â¢uill be devoted to the phraseology of
Some difficulty has been experienced
in finding the proper wording for a
reciprocity suggestion. Nearly all the
Senators who have attended the recent
conferences have contributed their '
share toward keeping the reciprocity
treaties negotiated by the McKinley
closely confined in com
mfttee pigeonholes. Reciprocity ' has
B*.t been popular in Congress and it wa s
with a great effort that the Cuban
legislation was passed.
. WILL BE CAREFULLY WORDED.
Senator, Aldrich announced when the
Cuban bill was under consideration
that there would be no more tariff
legislation by treaty. If anything is
said about reciprocity it will be so
worded as to mean that reciprocity
, shall be confined to such articles as are
not in competition with products of the
States.
Mention of the financial question will
â¢ consist of an allusion to the mainten
ance of the gold standard by the Re
publican party end a promise to con
tinue the finances of the country upon
ja. sound basis.
- Disfranchisement of the negroes in
Southern States will be denounced as
An encroachment on rights guaranteed
by the constitution.
The demand for restoration of the
merchant marine of the country will
be renewed, but it is not the intention
to indorse any specific plan-
There are several other suggestions
as to planks in the platform, but' the
desire to have fhe platform as brief
as possible may eliminate them from
consideration as unnecessary at this
.time.
"If the Republicans have a major
ity in the next House of Representa
tives, of which, in my opinion." h^
continued, "there is no reasonable
doubt. I will be a candidate to suc
ceed myself as Speaker. If, perchance,
however, the Republicans should not
have a majority in the next House I
will take my place on the floor and
give the best service in my power to
the minority. In my Judgment I can
do better service in my capacity as a
member of the House than I can do
elsewhere."
In an authorized interview with a - Post
reporter to-day, emphasizing his detp: -
mlnation with reference to the Vice
Presidency. As he concluded dictating
what he had to say the Speaker adder! :
"If there is any language which can
be more decisive write it in."
"What are your reasons for such a
statement?" he was asked.
"I have been for almost thirty years
a member of the national House of
Representatives. I may say my lif
work has been In connection with leg
islation in the House. I have been
nominated by the Republicans of th Â¦
Congressional district In which I re
side and accepted the nomination. I
have every reason to hope I shall be
re-elected.
WASHINGTON. May 3.â "Even at
the risk of being accused of declining
that which I probably could not get if
I desired It. I answer most unequivocal
ly that if the nomination were tendered
to me I would not accept It under any
circumstances whatever."
Thus strongly said Speaker Cannon
EUREKA, May 3. â The Demo
cratic Central Committee of Hum
boldt County met to-day and se
lected the following delegates to the
State Convention: J. F. Coonan, P. W.
Matthews, J. C. Gamble, C. B. Kelly,
L. F. Puter, WHIard Wells, W. H. M.
Smith, H. L. Ford, A. R. Thorpe, B. D.
McDonald and Patrick Quinn. The del
egation was not instructed. It Is sup
posed to be opposed to Hearst. The
delegation was pledged to use Its ef
forts to have Thomas Bair elected '"as
delegate to the National Convention.
STOCKTON, May 3.â The Hearst
forces made a feeble attempt to defeat
the regular Democratic nominations
for delegates to the State convention
in the primary election to-day* but cast
only flfty-Bix votes for their highest
candidate against 133 for the lowest
candidate on the regular ticket. The
opposition was not encouraged by the
leading Democrats and no effort was
made to get out a big vote on their
side. The nine delegates from Stockton
are against Hearst and of the eight
delegates from the outside or Twenty
fourth Assembly District, he has five
delegates, which is his full strength
in a delegation of seventeen represent
ing the county. The total Democratic
vote In the city is 1S00 and the vote
brought out to-day was only 189.
There was no opposition to the Re
publican delegates' and the vote was
light.

FRESNO, May 3. â In the primaries
to-day for the choosing tÂ»f delegates to
the Democratic State Convention the
Hearst nominees won 2 to 1 through
out the city.- The vote cast was fair
ly heavy for a primary. From the Six
tieth District Thomas E. Collins, J. H.
Hillman, G. W. Smith and Dante R.
Prince were elected; from the Sixty
first. Henry Brinkley, A. D. Giger, D.
S. Ewing and George W. Cartwright.
The men who were running on the
"uninstructed" ticket were E. D. Ed
wards. G. B. Graham, W. G. Bar
num and Charles McCardle from the
Sixtieth and W. H. McKenzie, W. D.
Crichton, M. K. Harris and M. C.
Williams from the Sixty-first.
There was but one ticket before the
Republicans and it was elected, as
follows: From the Sixtieth â George
Cosgrave, A. E. Snow, C. W. Chaun
cey; from the Sixty-firstâ S. L. Hogue,
A. M. Drew, Truman Hart and Frank

LOS ANGELES, May 3.â At the pri
mary election to-day, the first held here
under the new election law, there was
not a ripple of excitement, not a con
test in the Republican camp. The cau
cus nominees were chosen in every dis
trict and an extremely light vote was
polled.
What of excitement was lacking in
the Republican ranks was more than
made up by the Democrats. The Hearst
managers had been claiming a solid
delegation for Hearst to the Santa Crux
convention and they had the temerity
to^assert that certain prominent Demo
crats could not go as delegates because
they refused to support Hearst. Prom
inent among those placed under the
ban were Hon. I. B. Dockweiler, late
candidate for Lieutenant Governor, and
former Assemblyman Frank Finlayson.
Eddie Morris and Tom McCaffery were
also left out, but they refused to stay
lift out. â¢:
In every district a ticket in opposi
tion to the caucus tickets was put up
and all day the fight was waged. The
result was amazing to the Hearst peo
ple, for not an officer of the regular
Democratic County Committee was
elected. Dockweiler won out and, in
stead of sending a solid Hearst dele
gation to Santa Cruz, the Los Angeles
contingent will be divided about as fol
lows: For Hearst, 23; anti-Hearst. 11;
doubtful, 4. Dockweiler declares he
will from the floor of the convention
remind the Democrats of the State that
Hearst bolted the Lane ticket two
years ago and that he is now preparing
to bolt the coming national Democratic
ticket because his nomination is not
within the range of possibilities.

Special Dispatch to The Call
Beyond a ripple of excitement caused

The first election in May, as an ini
tial proceeding under section 13,73 of
the primary election law,..for the se
lection of delegates to a- national con
vention, was held in San Francisco
yesterday. The total number of votes
cast was 9370, of which the Republi
cans Rolled 6705 and the Democrats
2647. There were 11 votes for the Pro
hibition ticket and 7 scattering.
In the Thirty-ninth Assembly Dis
trict, where three Republican tickets
were in the field, the ticket of the Unit
ed Republican League, headed by R.
H. Countryman, won out, receiving 527
votes. The Citizens' Independent Re
publican ticket, headed by Wallace
Bradford, received 212 votes, and the
ticket headed by George W. Turner 160
votes.
There was a little contest in the
Democratic ranks of the Thirty-sixth,
District. The county committee ticket
won out by a narrow margin, securing
114 votes against 109 for the opposition.
The managers of Hearst's candidacy
deemed it advisable to offer no objec
tion to the delegates proposed by the
Democratic County Committee. The
feeling of indifference as to the out
come of the contest is signified by the
light Democratic vote.
Delegates to the Fourth Congres

as well as delegates to the Republican
State Convention at Sacramento and
the Democratic State Convention at
Santa Cruz were chosen.

There was some confusion at the
Hall of Justice yesterday, the Judges
being undecided whether or not to
hold court. When the' case of Leon
Soeder, charged with the murder of
Joseph Blaise, his brother-in-law, was
called, It was suggested to the Judge
that a continuance till this morning
might be advisable, as it was under
stood the Mayor had proclaimed that
the day be observed as a legal holiday.
The Judge referred to the act pass
ed in 1901, which provides that when
a primary election is to be held the
governing body shall have the # power
to make the day a legal holiday. The
Judge instructed his bailiff to tele
phone to the clerk of the Board of
Supervisors and ' ask whether the
board had proclaimed a legal holiday,
but there was no answer. Both sides
agreed; to continue the case till this
morning to obviate any cause for dis
pute.
Judge Lawlor Impaneled a jury to
try the case of James Moody,' charged
with an assault to commit murder,
and then adjourned out of respect to
the memory of the late Judge Rix.
Judge Dunne went through his cal
endar continuing all cases. Judge Ca
banlsswas the only Police Judge *to
make his appearance, and he contin

other Judges' calendars.

' During the evening music was fur

several occasions the Knickerbocker
quartet sang popular songs.
To-day Is to be the great day of
rest. Jhat is, It is to be rest for the
Officers of the organization, as no busi
ness is to be transacted, but two ex
cursions are to- be enjoyed. -,
The one considered the most Impor
tant is the trip to Asti as the guests of
the Northwestern Railroad and the
Italian-Swiss Colony. Only delegates
from the East and the local committee
are expected to participate In that
excursion. Up to 11 o'clock last night,
350 tickets had been issued for the trip.
The second choice is the extensive
trip to Alameda County, in which the
local organizations affiliated with the
grocers' association will participate.
Both excursions will be back in the
city by 5 o'clock, allowing ample time
for preparing for the theater party at
the Chutes.
to drop into the grocers' information
booth, where claret punch and lemon
ade were as free as water.
New York's regular representative
was not present, but William Gray was.
He said he didn't know why the regu
lar president was not present but he
was here like the crow, be-"caws." In
brief he told that New York was pro
hibited from admitting any one in its
organization who was not in the gro
cery business. All members of the bus
ine?s organizations were admitted to
membership to the State organization,
and in turn delegates would be sent to
the National Association. "I favor this
plan," he said, "but the plan is not ripe
yet with such cities as Brooklyn and
Xew York, for the grocer Is the de
spised creature in the commercial world
â he is isolated. The grocers of the
country have kept out of politics. The
grocers in our city have seri
ously opposed department stores
and won out on politics. Our organiza
tion secured a garnishment law to raise
the garnishment from 10 per cent on
$12 a week to $20 a week. This fact
was the climax of the work of the New
York Association.
W. F. McAllister, secretary of the
San Antonio (Texas) association, ' de
livered his annual address, pro
grammed for the afternoon. Instead of
reporting for the State of Texas. He
invited the delegates to take lessons
from the actions of Texas.
Ignoring the regularly laid out pro-
H. Corinth of Iowa excused the ab
sence cf A. M. Hough, presidents the
association, and, as there had been a
misunderstanding regarding the date
of meeting of the convention, he had
no report to make beyond progress.
F.-G. Herald, who was referred to as
the smallest man in the convention, as
he only weighs 2S0 pounds and is closa
to six feet in height, was appointed
rergeant-at-arms.
Illinois, the oldest organized State in
the union, was talked about by C. H.
Tebbetts. Illinois was the birthplace of
the national organization and that
State has a pardonable pride in the Re
tail Grocers' .Association.
An Invitation was extended by the
Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce to
the delegates of the convention to re
ceive the warm hand of Southern Cali
fornia.
At the afternoon session W. E. Sulli
van of Missouri gave tho report from
his State and said that the merchants
that take the tip from the merchants
of San Francisco, as the merchants of
Missouri have*, would be successful.
Committee meetings delayed a num
ber of delegates who were ready to re
spond with their reports. Wisconsin
was tho next State to be called upon.
Mr. Schwab, representing that State,
said every effort had been made in the
Badger State to see that the retail mer
chants should receive recognition of
their richtF in the line of Justice. The
association has succeeded in driving
from the State trading: stamps and in
organizing sixteen retail associations.

Joseph H. Stultz. president of the
California Ketail and Merchants' As
sociation, gave a detailed history of
the retail associations of California.
This ijtate has the oldest retail asso
ciation'in the Union. The laws which
the retailers have succeeded in having
passed by the California Legislature
were referred to to show what other
States might do. It is the intention of
the California associations to endeavor
to secure the passage of the Illinois
law which makes the husband and wife
jointly liable for the necessities of life.
The future looks bright for California.
TV. J. Galllgan of Loveland, Colo.,
president of the Retail Merchants' As
sociation of Colorado, reported for his
State by saying there was unity of ac
tion In Colorado. The greater portion
of his address was more of an essay on
the ethics of associations than a report
of conditions in his State. Toward the
close of his remarks the work done by
the association in securing the passage
of laws was recited. At the end of the
fourth year of the State organization
it can be said that the utmost success
has been accomplished.
The South Carolina and Georgia del
egates arrived at that time and were
greeted with applause.
E. R. Moore of Indiana, representing
President Fred Meyer, who could not
attend, delivered a verbal report and
cited the fact that a year ago the In
diana association was downcast, but
this year It has money in the treasury,
and that is practically due to the ef
forts of National Secretary Fred Mason.
Though Indiana is only represented by
three delegates in the convention, she
is full of enthusiasm. The present can
didate for Governor on the Republican
ticket was named by the Retail Mer
chants' Association.

A. R. Farlinger of Atlanta, Ga., vice
president of the national association
antl the man who is In line for the
presidency of the organization, was de
layed on Monday and did not have an
opportunity to deliver his address on
pure food as per programme. Yester
day he was assigned that duty by
President Lott and delivered a lengthy
report and essay Â¦ oh the subject of
pure food in the United States, which
will be read by health officers through
out the land with Interest. His. paper
covered every feature of pure food,
from the needs of such articles to the
ultimate results of legislation.
By the time Mr. Farlinger had con
cluded the delegates were anxious to
prepare for the night's enjoyment at
the pure food show.
A rising vote of thanks was given the
delegate from Australia for his ad
dress. "P\ "Â¦'Â¦'Â¦Â¦
Mr. Tyler was ready to answer ques
tions along the line of insurance. Iowa
wanted to know how he secured forty
merchants in North Dakota in the
Legislature, the speaker having claimed
that number. He replied by saying it
was an accident, but he hoped in the
future to have that number there.
Tyler explained the difference be
tween the contingent liability and that
of the old-line companies, and the re
sult was that a delegate from Wiscon
sin, who was evidently an old-line man,
took exception and went into the tech
nical details of the results.
Organization in New South Wales
was explained by George Nesbitt of
Sydney, who has been identified with
organization pf New South Wales.
The greatest trouble among the country
merchants has been from the traveling
salesmen. This has brought about dif
ficulties between the wholesaler and re
tailer. "We have seventy towns rep
resented in New South Wales. We also
have what you term your national
association. A clause is embodied in
the laws to prevent Chinese from en
tering into mercantile pursuits. We
are for the protection of the rural mer
chants in every respect. We own our
own railways and have curtailed the
parcel post, which is detrimental to
the merchant. Chinese Invasion Is op
posed in New South Wales. The retail
merchant is a politician, but he fails
to act. The laboring man in Australia
actually votes against his own con
science."
E. Ai Tyler of Fargo, N. D., spoke on
the subject of insurance, which In
volved the merchant who was under
that protection. He gave figures to
show why the merchants should be on
the inside of the companies that car
ried the risks. Statistics upon statistics
followed statistics as only, insurance
men can outline them. Political graft
cuts considerable figure, according to
the speaker's idea, in all insurance un
less the question is controlled. Mutual
fire insurance would never accomplish
the good it does unless there be central
organization and eventually national.
Such an organization was completed
in March of this year.
During Mr. Tyler's address, which
was not limited to time, the delegates
dwindled to sixty-seven members. As
only twenty-five are required to con
duct business a quorum was present.
IXSIJIIAXCE LESSONS.
Vice President Lux of Minnesota re
ported in behalf of his State, in the
absence of Simon Clark, the regular
president, and quoted poetry to the
extent of "Auld Lang Syne." The
speaker took the position that Abe
Lincoln took the wrong ground when
he left his work unfinished, as " he
failed to enact a national law abolish
ing the corner grocer, who keeps open
eighteen hours a day, gives indiscrim
inate credit, sells goods at cost and
works with greater vim for the dear
public than he does for his own fam
ily. 'Born a man, died a grocer' Is
the epitaph which' was placed upon
the grave stone of a deceased grocer,
who had lived seventy years without
a holiday, who had never ridden on a
railroad train, who worked every Sun
day as hard and faithfully as on Sat
urday, who smelt tea, coffee and spices
in the very air he breathed and who,
if he ever attended church, sat In his
pew soliloauizlnjr as to whether St.
Peter used sugar in his tea or what
his chances would bo to sell his gro
ceries In the great beyond."
John A. Green, representing Ohio,
took the ground that the garnishment
law had placed in the pockets of the
retail grocers the sum of $12,000.
"If"" one organization can do this,
what can the total organizations do
in the matter of collections? If mer
chants in organizations can do this,
what will be the result of united ef
forts of a national organization work
ing In harmonv?" The national or
ganization is no longer'an experiment.
Two weeks arro Ohio passed a law
recognizing trading stamps, redeem
able in cash or equivalent.
F. M. Spain, as the organizer of
the State of Washington, was called
to the platform as the representative
of "Washington. He was authorized to
say Washington would pay its per
capita tax for the National Associa
tion. And "I am further authorized to
say that while our organization is but
four years old it has placed upon the
statute books a pure food law. Wash
ington has done more for the National
Association than any other State."
The convention applauded his re
marks.
gramme, the chair took a catch-as
catch-can order and galled upon Sol
Westerfleld of Chicago. The speaker
took the ground that the trading stamp
evil had been encountered by the peo
ple of Chicago. Bv united effort it
was agreed among the members of
the larrest firms that trading stamps
should be sent to the basement and
used as fuel, and that the only proper
way to gain public opinion is to ap
peal to the public and put down the
trading stamp scheme.

STOCKTON. May 3.â If there was
any doubt as to H> E. Huntington's
intention of building an immense elec
tric power and transportation system
throughout the San Joaquin Valley it
ought to be seriously shaken' by the
news that D. L. Wlshon, the reputed
right of way agent of H. E. Hunting
ton, to-day filed applications \ in the
local United States Land Office for
rights of way and sites for mammoth
reservoirs and power plants in Fresno
County and for transmission lines from
them to. Los Angeles, San Francisco
and all points in the San Joaquin Val
ley, { including Stockton. .
The main reservoirs, according to the
application filed, will be in Crane Val
ley in the. Sierra Nevada Mountains in
Fresno County. . One "of . the reservoirs
will contain 800 acres. The fall is so
great there that /the' same "water will
be % used in three power plants in a dis
tance, of eight miles. The' applications
filed; show that the contemplated power
system will be the greatest in the West.

Mrs. J. B. Hume to-day resigned as
president of the Ebell Society. The
action took the board of directors by
eurprise, as Mrs. Hume had only serv
ed as the head of Oakland's exclusive
woman's club a few weeks. Her elec
tion had been of very recent date.
In announcing her decision to with
draw from the official work of the so
ciety, Mrs. Hume said that ill-health
of her husband impelled her to step
out, as she did not believe her domes
tic afTairs would warrant her in con
tinuing as the leader of the large or
ganization. Mrs. Hume feared that
the Vork entailed in the position
would severely overtax her in view of
the -increased demands for her pres
ence at home.
The board of directors urged Mrs.
Hume to take a vacation instead of re
eisning. but she did not think that
course- would be fair to the society or
to herself.
yit was with regret that the mem
bers of the board, as well as others
In the society, heard the resignation
presented at the regular business meet
ing: to-day of the society.
As soon as the board meets again
Mrs. Hume's resignation will be ac
cepted. Meantime Mrs. C W. Kin
sey. vice president. Is acting as pres
ident. An effort is being made to in
duce Mrs. Kinsey to accept the posi
tion of president as successor to Mrs.
Hume.
At to-day's meeting the question of
the new site for the society's home
was considered, but no progress was
made toward a decision. Those who
favor the present location at Thir
teenth and Harrison streets are de-
Firous of having a called meeting of
the society.

census which has Just been completed

dren. The report was made at a

year there are only 17,412 on the list.

Professor Ritter said to-day that the
Audubon Society would aim to create a
sentiment against the employment of
bird feathers as decoration for women's
hats, and that a direct appeal would
be made to all co-eds to stop the prac
tice. In time a State organization will
be perfected and the people more gen
erally interested in the esthetic and
commercial value of birds.
The co-eds of the University of Cali
fornia will be asked to help protect the
wild birds of California from exter
mination. They will be asked not to
wear the feathers of birds on their
hats and to discourage the wearing pf
them on the hats of others.' And that
the' campaign in behalf of the birds
may be carried on with some sort of
system, they are invited. to join an anti
bird feather society.
The Audubon Society is the name of
this proposed humane organization. It
was suggested by Professor W. E. Rit
ter of the department of zoology of the
university, and 'the idea comes from
Southern California, where several such
societies already exist. The first meet
ing will be held on Wednesday after
noon, when not only the women but the
men students of the university are ex
pected to be present to subscribe their
names to the charier roll of the so
ciety. Professor Hitter and L. J. Miller
and J. S. Hunter, students, will be
there to explain its objects and to pre
vail upon the co-eds to pledge them
selves against wearing the plumage of
the birds.

TUESDAY. MAT 3.
REAL, ESTATE TRANSACTION'S.
The decision is one that has attracted
considerable attention, as the matter
has been hanging fire since last Novem
ber. It has been the custom to "dock"
a teacher's salary for absences of as
little as half a day and it is believed
that Boards of Trustees are not alto
gether to blame for this and that if
they have the power teachers' wages
will be paid as other county officials
whose salaries go rain or
shine, present or absent.
On account of sickness H. C. Petray,
principal of the Haywards School, was
absent for a month from his duties.
His trustees, however, allowed his sal
ary and the clerk of the board drew
his warrant upon the Superintendent
for the amount. When the warrant
wag presented to County Superinten
dent Crawford he refused to draw his
requisition on the Auditor for the
amount, claiming that Petray had not
earned the money.
In speaking . on the question this
morning Deputy District Attorney
Hynes said:
The Supreme Court ha* decided that
Boards of Supervisors are the proper judges of
bills presented to them and that what they
pass upon Is not subject of review by any one.
1 take It that the powers ot a board of trus
tees of a school district are on all fours with
those of the Board of Supervisors in this re
gard. Xo one can be so well posted on wheth
er a bill should be allowed or not as the trus
tees. In this instance the superintendent only
learned by accident that Fetray was not on
duty. He cannot be expected to know what is
taking place in the various districts of the
county.
The District Attorney has decided
that the action of a Board of School
Trustees in drawing a warrant on the
County Treasurer cannot be reviewed
by the County Superintendent of
Schools, and the point is one of much
interest to the teachers thrc-ughoilt the
county.

HANFORD, May 3.â The sixteenth
annual session of the Grand Court of
Foresters of America began in this city
to-day, and to-night hundreds of dele
gates and visitors from all parts of the
State have possession of the city and
are enjoying themselves thoroughly.
By the time the last train had arrived
last evening the executive committee
estimated the number of Foresters then
in the city at 300,' and to-day fully 250
arrived on two other special trains. The
first train to arrive was around the
Santa Fe loop, at 11 o'clock, and
brought the Tulare County contingent,
numbering about 250, of which Court
Mount Whitney of Tulare had fully
eighty members, this being the largest
delegation from any one court. ...
This train also had the Dinuba con
cert band with it, and was met by a
large delegation of local Foresters and
delegates. The visitors were conducted
to the committee headquarters, where
accommodations were provided for all.
At 1:30 o'clock the officers of the
Grand Court and 125 delegates paraded
to the courthouse grounds and then to
the Santa Fe depot to meet the third
special excursion. This one came from
Fresno and had fifty-five delegates and
as many visitors on board. The dele
gates all wore red coats and hats and
tarried Japanese parasols.
The grand parade was then formed,
with the Sixth Regiment band, the
Dinuba concert band and the Fresno
military band. The delegation from
Court Yosemite No. 72 of Fresno and
the Grand Court officers In carriages
were in the lead. "When the parade had
been formed and was marching it
reached for seven blocks. After the
march through the business portion of
town the delegates broke ranks at the
City Park, where the address of wel
come was delivered by Mayor Widmer.
lie presented the city key to Grand
Chief Ranger Henry A. Gabriel, who
responded briefly - to the Mayor's re
marks and thanked the citizens for the
hospitable treatment. Senator Edward
Wolfe, junior past grand chief ranger,
was also called upon for a few re
marks.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
Intense excitement reigned, and a
crowd of several thousand people gath
ered from all directions. The majority
of the women did not remain long to
witness the gory spectacle, and those
that did looked on with blanched faces.
At the hospital Chief Surgeon C. F.
Millar, assisted by Emergency Surgeon
Pinkham, put forth every effort to save
Capp's life, but without avail. It re
quired- all of the hospital attendants to
hold him on the table, and not until
sheer exhaustion ensued from loss of
blood did, he cease his struggles. From
several sonnets found in his possession
unrequited love may have deranged his
mind. Letters from Plymouth, Ohio,
show that he owned some property In
that city. Deceased resided at 512 Ma
son street, and as far as can be as
certained was unmarried. At the St.
Francis Hotel those in charge were reti
cent and nothing concerning the dead
man could be ascertained. The body
was removed to the Morgue by Deputy
Meehan.
After almost decapitating himself
â¢with a pocket knife with suicidal in
tent,- Barney Capp, a window washer
employed at the St. Francis Hotel, en
gaged in a sensational battle with Pa
trolman Jim Pearl last evening, a'nd it
required the efforts of four officers to so
manacle him that he could be conveyed
to the Central Emergency Hospital for
treatment. He died at that Institution
on the operating table.
About 5 o'clock last evening pedes
trians on Geary street, near Powell,
were horrified to see the demented man
draw a knife across his throat, and, as
his life blood ebbed away from the sev
erance of the jugular veins, calmly
promenade In front of the hotel until
the arrival of Patrolman Pearl, who
had been called by a citizen.
Pearl approached Capp and grabbed
him by the arm, but the unfortunate
man upon seeing the officer became a
raving maniac. Pearl attempted to
throw him to the ground, but Capp
fought furiously. Pearl finally suc
ceeded in throwing Capp over the
wheel of a carriage at the curb. With,
the assistance of Patrolman Attridge
and several bystanders the handcuffs
were placed on the demented man and
he was placed in an ambulance.
TOPEKA, Kans., May 3.âApproxi
mately 5000 men are out on the Santa
Fe system to-day, as claimed by Presi
dent O'Connell of the International As
sociation of Machinists. This statement
is based on reports received this morn
ing. Of the 5000 about 1200 are machin
ists and the others are boilermakers,
blacksmiths, tinsmiths, copper workers,
helpers and semi-skilled laborers of the
allied metal mechanics. The reports
say that twenty-one shops and round
houses are affected, all shops west of
La Junta, Colo., to the Paciflc Coast
being completely tied up.
BAKERSFIELD. May 3.â Absolute
quiet prevailed around the Santa Fe
shops in this city, where the machinists
went out yesterday. None of them vis
ited the company's reservation since
leaving, in obedience to the orders of
the union. The roundhouse is being
guarded by special deputies- and no one
is allowed to enter without a pasa, so
as to prevent any possibility of damage
being done the property by Irresponsi
ble persons.

-KEW YORK. May 3.â President E.
'If. Harriman of the Union Pacific and
Southern Pacific roads, who has just
returned from a tour of Inspection of
'those properties, gave an informal in-
Jorview to-day dealing â¢with some ob
jervations made by him during his trip.
He .eays he found conditions in the
â¢\\Yst- and Southwest much better than
fce thought they would be at the
time he made his previous trip to those

c'aid, .the extreme depression in the

Â£oner*illy in this part of the country
â¢Vere clearly reflected In the West and
jSouthwest.
â¢'Â¦ Conditions now are so much better
that^ he felt warranted in ordering
C'iore equipment for the Harriman roads
than. he originally intended to do. Re
garding the Southern Paciflc, Harri
man said that the road was now be
ginning to see daylight in the matter
pf extraordinary expenses. Speaking of
the L.ucin cut-off near Salt L4ke City,
Â¦which has been a source of great ex
pciÂ»se.and has baffled the skiU of the
b^st 'railway engineers, Harriman said
fhat freight trains were now being
run over it, but It was not deemed
advisable to carry passengers. Harri
siÂ«an 6aid he had not given much
thmight to the matter of dividends on
The Sciuthern Pacific, but intimated
Yhet once dividends were begun they
Â¦w eyld be continued. Crop conditions

to. Harriman. were much better than

THE annual report of the Associated Charities of
San Francisco for- 1903 has just been issued and
contains a full and interesting explanation of the
year's work. The total receipts for the year amounted
to $10,551 88, and the expenditures to $5911 50, leaving a
balance on hand at the first of this year of $4640 38,
The actual income, however, for the year from donations
and subscriptions was $3730, and the expenses $5911, so
that there would -have been a deficit were it not for the
Miranda W. Lux bequest of $4623 91 received in June.
The report states that while there is much reason for
congratulation over the success of the year's work, the
expenses which must be incurred during, the present
year will amount to over $7000, or almost twice the in
come from subscriptions and donations in 1903. That
will necessitate $3500 additional frpm new subscriptions
and donations if the work contemplated is to be carried
out. The increase is desired more particularly to pro
vide a "Children's Department," to deal better with pov
erty and crime in its inception, in the belief that the hos-;
pital and reformatory are preferable to the prison and
asylum. The report shows the number of subscribers
for 1903 to have been 575, as against -45 for 1902, ana
that in the three years of the association's existence
3093 cases have been investigated.
The plan of having a central agency like the Associated
Charities, with a corps of experienced assistants acting
as an investigating committee for the various co-operat
ing charitable bodies of the city, obviates unsystematic
and purposeless giving by a number of different associa
tions and individuals working independently and without
organization. After all. the only real charity is that
which discriminates, for much the almsgiving ; not
based on a knowledge of , the particular case, tends to de
grade rather than to uplift.

Congress has Adjourned and the politician has been
swept from Washington and has been thrown broadcast
among us to continue the Presidential campaign that has
been so poorly concealed under the guise of proposed
legislation for months. The rubbish from the national
capital, however, will not affect the public mind or blind
it to'the real issues involved in the great political battle.
Our own service torpedoes, which
are made at Woolwich, at Portland
and at Leeds; the French service tor
pedoes, many of which are .made at
Toulon; the Russian service torpedoes,
which are made in Russia: the Ger
man service torpedoes, which are
made in Germany â all owe their ex
istence to the original invention of
Mr. Whitehead. an invention now more
than a generation old; and although
each national type differs somewhat
from every other, each still bears a
strong cousinly resemblance to the
service torpedo which the firm of
Whitehead makes to-day at Fiume, oh
the Adriatic, for, such powers as have
no torpedo manufacturing plant of
their own. Among these powers is
Japan.
It is true that the original White
head was a weapon that traveled on
the surface of the water only, while
the modern automobile torpedo is es
sentially a submarine engine. Many
years, nevertheless, have now elapsed
since the m:irvelous weapon, by steady
evolution, became extraordinarily per
fect and formidable, although it is
but right to add that its improvement
has been continuous from first to last,
and is not yet at a standstill. Strange
to say, however, the significance of the
automobile torpedo as a factor in
naval warfare is only now beginning
to receive adequate recognition. The
weapon has always had its enthusias
tic champions, of course, although
until quite recently they have been
the few, while its detractors have been
in the majority.
It was admitted that the automobile
torpedo had won successes during the
civil war in Chile, during the revolu
tionary fighting in Brazil and during
the conflict between Japan and China;
"but," said the wiseacres, "wait until
one of the leading naval powers is
concerned, and then you will see that
although the torpedo may be all very
well against South Americans or yel
low men, it won't work against civi
lized Europeans."
In spite of this sort of discourage
ment, which reached them from with
in the various services as well as from
without, torpedo officers have never
ceased to study and develop their fa
vorite weapon. They Increased it3
speed from ten or twelve to upward
of thirty miles an hour: they increased
its range from three or four hundred
to a couple of thousand, yards or more;
they increased its explosive carrying
capacity from thirty to nearly two
hundred pounds, and they increased
the accuracy of its submarine flight,
both lateral and vertical, until, even
in a cross-running tideway, its pre
cision could be depended upon. By
means of a device which is now being
perfected in America the speed of the
weapon can be increased to some for
ty miles an hour up to 2000 yards. The
process employed is a mere superheat
ing of the compressed air as it is fed
from the "flask," or reservoir, to the
driving machinery; and it involves lit
tle additional expense. We kndw -now
what the Japanese, acting not agafnst
careless and ignorant Celestials, but
against the finest officers and best
ships of a leading European navy,
have been able to do with this perfect
ed engine of destruction. Xo one will
ever again decry the power of the tor
pedo. â London Mail.
The Whitehead automobile torpedo
may be regarded as the parent of al
most all the automobile torpedoes
which are now in use in the navies of
the world.

The report of the Mc-sley Educational
Commission to the effect that only men
Ehould be employed as teachers for
bovfi above ten years of age has been
rfollowed by a similar report from the
MalÂ«Â» Teachers' Association of Xew
York City.
.The reasons given by these superior
'â¢maie teachers for the discarding of the
"women "teachers, apparently to give
themselves more positions, is really
amusing. .;,
In order to substantiate his position.
Professor Henry E. Armstrong of Lon
don, in the Mosley Educational report,
has been obliged to admit what few j
men have been willing to do before. To
1>rcYe that women are incapable of
teaching boys above the age of child
"Through the entire period of her
existence woman has been man's slave,
and if the theory of evolution be in any
way correct there is no reason to sup
pose that she will recover from the
nttntal disabilities which this has en
tailed upon her within any period which
we for practical purposes can regard
as reasonable."
The conclusion is drawn that women
having been the slaves of men all these
ape* are not capable of teaching boys,
"but are all right for girls."
One cannot help wondering how such
. Inferior mothers can produce such won.
, derful sons, at least when we take into
" consideration the fact tnat sons, as a
rule, inherit the personal and intel
lectual traits of the mother and the
daughter those of the father.
We understand the traditions that
have been thrown around the life and
education cf girls has interfered with
the "full development of their faculties
and- until such restrictions are removed
it is impossible to judge to what heights
â¢ a woman is capable of going, but ln
: stead' 'erf cementing this wall of preju
' still stronger around the education
-of women, thus preventing their further
"development, these learned men should
lend a helping hand to their sisters and
thus encourage them to develop their
God-given faculties unfettered by tra
ditions of the past.^. .
" T.he Mosley Educational Commission
. agrees that many women are effem
inizing the boys and one of them is
.reported as saying: "We want teach
ers who can give the boys a punch in
the head once in a while and teach them
â¢ to do likewise."
The Male Teachers' Association of
New York City has a long list of griev
ances. "Women," they say, "have not
only crowded men out of the elemen
tary' schools, but are slowly forcing
* them out of the high schools." On ac
count of the "feminization of the teach
ing force" the girls outnumber the boys
â¢ in the high school. In some cities 4
lo 1.
These learned men have also decided
that the maintenance of "so many
unmarried women teachers is one* of
. the agencies which tends to decrease
the number erf men and women who
marry, "thus prohibiting them (the
. women) from undertaking their more
* natural place in the world's work."
" "Man appeals to the boy through his
.sense of right and justice, but the wo
man appeals to the child through sen
timent." ;/.-/
These wise men would have us un
derstand that women have stolen the
profession of teaching from them
through their willingness to teach for
]om*>r wages, but they try to prove to
Cs that the "loss to the, boy in pelf-re
liance, courage, high purpose and man-
Jy character far outweighs the less
wages paid to ".omen."
I wonder it has never occurred to
thw*- men that thÂ«Â» easiest and most
effectual way of ridding themselves of
the woman fearhcrs is to put all their
force into securing the passage of a
law requiring equal pay for equal work
in the public schools, irrespective of
rtx. and then if the people preferred to
have m*n teachers over their boys
"ft ere would not be this barrier of
wapes. and Justice would be done both
* the men and women teachers. It would
tfien be the one best fitted to fill the
rÂ»osition. rather than the one who could
be obtained for the If-ast money, that
would s'vure the position. I really won
der if these men dare stand upon their
6>\n merit with a "fair field and no
favor." The women, I know, would be
only too glad to take their chances on
this basis.
' . Aftc r enumerating almost every evil
â¢imaginable as h result of so many
Â¦ women teacher-, like the loss of social
landing for the man when engaged in
e feminized profession, they conclude
â¢Â»y saying that "It is wrong to give
education over to a claÂ«s."
If thi* association thinks it wrong to
pive education over to a class. I would
Jike to aek what they think about glv-
Imr our Government over to a class.
Women are obliged to submit to a far
prcat^r Injustice through having the
Government, which they not only help
to sunport, but whope laws they must
obey, given entirely over to a class, and
one of the injustices to which they
must submit through this Injustice is
teaching in the public schools for from
one-half to two-thirds the salary paid
a man for the same work, but we never
bear a. word of protest from the Male
Teachers' Association against this in
justice* If they wish justice done to
themselves they had best first exhibit
a little of it toward their Bister teach
ers.

treaties by other states with China up to the time of the
Russian occupation of Manchuria in 1900." But she is
only disposed to recognize treaties concluded since then
on condition that existing treaties between Russia 'and
China and Russian interests in Manchuria shall be un
prejudiced thereby. : This- 'applies tq our commercial
treaty with China concluded last July, opening new ports
in Manchuria.
The exaÂ«perating- fact about that treaty is that our
State Department took pains to communicate its terms
to Russia before the exchange of ratifications, and Cas
sini, 'by order of his Government, on the 28th of last
June, conveyed Russian assent to that treaty, and imme
diately thereafter Russia, attempted, by threats made at
Peking, to prevent the ratification by China! Since the
treaty was ratified Russia has assumed to control the
ports which it openedto the trade of the world, and has
excluded from them our Consuls appointed in accordance
with the treaty!
So, when the Japanese stormed and carried the Rus
sian entrenchments mi the Yalu, slaughtered the Cos
sacks, captured artillery, took prisoners and set the Rus
sian army on the run, every genuine American approved
and applauded. Japan. stands for international faith and
fairness, and her diplomatic history is not stained by a
single lie, while that of Russia is not relieved or redeemed
by a single truth or. the keeping of a single promise.
None can foresee the fortunes of war, but if the struggle
in Eastern Asia continue as it has begun, the most brutal
and backward power now on earth will meet the very
ultimate of humiliation at the hands of enlightened and
civilized Japan, standing as the avenger of the nations
that have been deceived, lied to and victimized by Musco
vite trickery and deception.
Meantime, while the.se promises were pending, and in
defiance of our note, Russia sought to force China into
a separate treaty as to Manchuria. When our Minister
at Peking detected this intrigue it was promptly denied
by Lamsdorff, and by his order the denial was made offi
cially at Washington by Count Cassini. This impeached
our. Minister, who later furnished absolute proof, supplied
by the Tsung-li Yamen in the form of the text of the
treaty, that he had not misinformed his Government.
Russia then unblushingly admitted the attempt, but at
tempted to palliate her infamous conduct by arguing that
the treaty would not mean what its text stood for!
There followed the Russian seizure of Newchwang, a
treaty port, and this was followed by more promises to
get out- of Manchuria, every one of which was broken.
To crown her dishonor, after breaking her last promise,
Russia announced that she was "disposed to recognize
In 1901 our State Department, in a note, admonished
China against making separate arrangements with any
single power respecting Manchuria. This seems to have
been caused by a knowledge of Russia's design to take
advantage of her breach of faith in regard to evacuation
of the disputed province. Our diplomatic note left no
room for mistaking its purpose, which was the -guarantee
of the integrity of China. It was made the subject of
inquiry at St. Petersburg, and Count Lamsdorff assured
the British Minister^ that '.:_e Czar had no intention of
departing in any way from the assurance he had publicly
given that Manchuria would be entirely restored to its
former condition in the Chinese, empire as soon as cir
cumstances admitted."
Thereafter Russia was left to judge independently of
ihe time when circumstances would admit of such action.
She did so judge and fixed dates repeatedly for the evac
uation she had promised. The last promise made to the
United States was that Manchuria should be evacuated
last October. ThiÂ«, like every Russian promise, was
broken.
THE sea victories of Japan have been followed now
by a significant but not decisive victory for her
land forces. While the reports are meager, it is
evident that the action on the Yalu is of great importance
to the islanders, aside from their capture of many guns
and much army stores and plunder. European military
critics have deprecated a Japanese advance into Man
churia. But the Japanese military strategists seem to
look upon that province as the Russian* base, in which
view it is important that it be seized.- Japan insisted, be
fore war began, upon the recognition of Chinese sover
eignty in Manchuria. In her behalf it. must be urged
that this was simply insisting that Europe, and especially
Russia, keep faith.
This association informs* us that it
is for the interest of the women teach
ers, as well as the boys, that fewer
women be employed.
We have always noticed that when
men try to take a thing that belongs
to women it is always for the good of
the women. When girls were not al
lowed to attend the public schools it
was for the good of the girls. When the
law gave everything a woman pos
sessed to her husband, who could will
it away from her at his death, it was
for the best interests of the women.
Man has protested against every step
in the progress of women, from learn
ing to read to having the ballot, and
then taunts her with havjn<? been the
slave of men, and consequently not
capable of teaching boys.
We who realize the struggles through
which ehe has been obliged to pasfe in
order to secure her present position in
the world may be pardoned if we look
with suspicion upon the action of the
Male Teachers' Association.
"Why should not women get all
this? Why? Simply because man, be
ing both 'verdict' and 'execution, 1 has
kept everything for himself."
he wrote "Are Men Fair to Women?"
He says: "To begin with, are men fair
to women? The laws, which are made
by men. the usages â everything is cal
culated to cause, men to reduce to a
minimum the qualities, the intelligent*
and the influence of women. For in
stance, let a woman make a reputation
in art or literature, and men begin to
smile and shrug their shoulders. They
dlspute her talent.
"I maintain, without fear of contra
diction, that a woman in ordej to suc
ceed in a profession must have ten
times more talent than a man, inas
much as a man will have friends and
comrades to help him. and a woman
only difficulties put in her way by man
to surmount.
"MÂ»n receives encouragement from
all sides.

the habit of dining upon Saturday as*
upon Sunday, but, being puzzled with
the different practices then prevailing
(for they had begun to fast at Rome
on Saturday), ho consulted St. Am
brose, the Bishop of Milan, on the
subject and the answer of the Milan
saint was: 'When I am here I do not
fast on Saturday ;^_when I am at Roma
I do fast on Saturday.' " Burton, in

those persons who are always swayed

Soft, now shrill.
The whippoorwill is crying
"Whip-poor-will."
Th<> cows are milked: the cattle fed;
The last far streaks of evening fade;
The farm-hand whistles in the shed.
And in the house the table's laid;
The lamp streams on the parden-bed.
The whip-poor-will Is calling,
"Whip-poor-will, whip-poor-will."
Where the dogrwood blooms are falling
On the hill:
The afterglow is waning.
And the whippoorwill's complaining,
Wild and shrill.
The whippoorwill's complaining, .
"Whip-poor-will." ~
The moon blooms out, a great white rose;
The stars wheel onward toward the

The barnyard cock wakes once and
crows;
The farm is wrapped in peaceful rest;
The cricket chirps: the firefly glows.
The whippoorwill Is calling.
"Whip-poor-will, whip-poor-will."
Where the bramble-blooms are falling
On the rill:
The moon her watch is keeping.
And the whlpnoorwtll is weeping.
'^Whip-poor-will, whip-poor-will"; '
Lonely still.
The whippoorwill is weeplnff;

The chairman of the committee ex
plained its errand, stating that it was
desired to ornament the town's burial
ground, and incidentally asked Blank
for a subscription.
"Well, for my part I think it a very
foolish idea," said Blank. "Certainly
no one wants to break into the cem
etery: 'it's a sure thing that no one
can break out: so what's the use of
putting a fence around the place?"
One dav some of the aforesaid cit
izens deemed It advisable to put , a
fence around the city cemetery. A com
mittee waited on Blank in the hope
that he would contribute for the dead
where he would not do so for the liv
ing.
A certain rich man who recently de
parted- this sphere was a merchant in
Sonora in the early days, and although
possessed even at that time of con
siderable of the world's goods he was
not noted for his charitable deeds. Mr.
Blank, was always averse to sub
scribing for the public improvements
that had been projected in the town,
and whenever any such plan was set
on foot Blank was approached with
considerable misgiving on the part of
his more progressive fellow citizens.

,A romantic story of the war, with a
very tragic ending, has reached Paria
from Russia, says the London Tele-
graph. Among the men belonging to a
Siberian regiment stationed at Port Ar
thur was a soldier named LlatnikofT.
who was popular with his comrade?,
but was often chaffed about his effemi
nate appearance. He had been selected
as servant by a young officer, at whose
quarters he lodged. One unlucky day
while he was on an errand he fell and
broke a leg.
Liatnlkoff . expressed a very strong
wish not to be taken to the hospital,
and as he was being conveyed thither
he took a penknife out of his pocket
and deliberately severed an artery in
his left arm. As the soldier on his ar
rival there was being undressed to be
put to bed the surgeons, to their
amazement, perceived that he was not
what he had represented himself tq be.
Liatnikoff, in fact, was a beautiful girl,
barely 13 years of age. Blood poisoning
supervened, and the patient had only
been three days in the hospital when
all hope of recovery had to be aban
daned. The young woman sent -for the
officer in whose service she had been
and implored him to marry her, re
minding him that it was her devotion
to him which had led her to pass her
self off as a man in order that sha
might follow him to the Far East. His
brother officers are also said to hava
pleaded her cause, but for some unex
plained reason he would not listen to
them. As 'soon, however, as he had
heard of the death of the poor girl who
had loved him so well he returned tq
his quarters and blew out his brains.

THERE are 30,000 acres of waving grain where old
Lake Tulare once afforded a home for fish and
fowl, so says the Hanford Sentinel. The hunter
and the fisherman have vanished from the locality aiid
farmers with agricultural implements have succeeded
the fishermen with their nets and lines and the hunters
with their guns. Wheat grows on the spot across which
in the memory of many living Californians a steamboat
plied. The grain crop on the old lake bed is estimated
to be worth $1,000,000. This is a complete transforma
tion worthy indeed to be recorded as it signifies the gen
eral movement in California of which it is a symptom.
The country around Los Angeles was once largely a
desert, and this is true of the thousands of orchard bear
ing acres, rich in' oranges and other semi-tropical fruits,
that make grateful the present landscape about a score
or more of thriving southern communities. Once the
Sacramento Valley was, thought to be valuable only as a
great wheat area. It is now demoted to the production of
so many sorts of vegetation that' a mere enumeration
would be cause for the people of less favored lands to
wonder. The same is true of the San Joaquin Valley.
There the raisin industry has taken on large propor
tions and is world famous. Oranges grow successfully,
from the commercial point of Anew, in several degrees
of latitude in California. The dry and parched lands
have been transformed. Their merits have been discov
ered. Vineyards wave their green foliage in the breezes;
olives, cereals and deciduous fruits guarantee . comfort
and opulence.
San Francisco may be less regarded by the present
generation as the "scene of the most wonderful transfor
mation of all, but such it is. What the sand dunes are
that lie south of Point Lobos and between that broad
avenue and Golden Gate Park, what the vast accumula
tions of sand in many parts of the city west of First
avenue are, show the exact appearance, of a great part of
San Francisco within the memory of the pioneers.
Golden Gate Park was made possible by the planting of
bunch grass and the subsequent plantations of trees that
would thrive with comparatively little water in sandy
wastes.
Parks and avenues that were daily clouded with great
volumes of flying dust have been oiled and the road
beds are thereby bound down, just as 'securely as the
fleeting sands that used to scud before the stiff summer
breezes from the Pacific Ocean have been anchored by
bunch grass and by windbreaks formed of trees and mis
cellaneous vegetation. The great Western Addition was
made of sand very largely. Where there are stately
mansions the boys used to chase jackrabbits and eat
wild blackberries that thrived on sunny exposures amid
the sandhills.
Death Valley has become the seat of a great borax
industry. Mines that produce gold abundantly have
been developed on the Mojave and Colorado deserts.
The greatest productive oil field in California, that which
is known as the Kern River field, takes the place of
former sand wastes, and busy industry there delves for
wealth and revolutionizes the manufactures of a State
with cheap fuel that is extracted from beneath the sands.
Man has torn down high hills and even mountains with
the hydraulic mining process, and the topography of cer
tain sections has been completely metamorphosed.
Along the Feather and A'uba rivers the modern gold
dredging machine has become a great producer of wealth.
The deposits of the precious metal that have been swept
down by floods for thousands of years have been dis
covered. Where orcharded areas have succeeded the
yearly wheat fields by the river banks dredgers for gold
have come to effect another transformation. The or
chards have been pulled up and destroyed. The land in
which they, stood* and thrived has been turned over, and
again the topography of a country has been changed
markedly.
The topography of San Francisco suffered a great
change. In the early days Montgomery street was the
water front. Long wharves were extended into, the bay
to facilitate landing. The sandhills were thrown down
to fill up the spaces between the wharves, and the city
gradually advanced to the present line of the seawall,
where it will permanently stop.
These are but a few of the transformations. *Wher
ever there has been constructed an irrigation system the
character of the products and not ?ess of the population
has changed: Los Angeles crowns its hills 'with homes
and orchards and then finds oil, and lo! an army of der
ricks and an industrial transformation. These are but
a few instances. Truly this is a wonderful land. Â¦'â¢

At . this ship's tribunal Johnson
faced the captain. What the skipper
said to him could not be heard, but
at the close of the interview Johnson
meekly saluted and walked forward.
The explanation came next day
when the gunner confided to a fellow
officer that Johnson, who had been
given every night ashore, spent them
roystering about, then came aboard
ship, donned the helmet and suit and
slipped over the side of the ship, os
tensibly to clean the ship's bottom,
but really to sleep. His shipmates
were in on it of course.
The gunner's suspicions had been
aroused when he noticed that the air
bubbles that always appear on the
surface directly over a diver did not
vary a foot during all the time John
son was down. When he investigated
he found Johnson hanging like a huge
barnacle^to the side of the ship. His
arms were dangling about in the
water and his reclining position was
maintained by the aid of his signal
lines, one of which he had passed
around his shoulders and the other
about his feet.
Some queer yarns are told about the
men who wear the uniform of a sailor
in the service of Uncle Sam. Probably
the queerest is the one told of Gun
ner's Mate Johnson, a strapping big
Swede at present serving out an en
listment on board a ship of war that
frequently visits San Francisco.
Johnson, it appears, is a most con
vivial soul and fond of his grog. He
is also a good sailor, but shines as a
diver. A short time ago, while his
ship was anchored near Mare Island,
it became necessary to send Johnson
down into the depths to take off some
of the growth from the hull. His
first dive lasted about an hour. When
he came up he told the executive offi
cer it would< take about a week to
make the ship's bottom clean. He was
given the task and> every day at 9
o'clock, clad in rubber suit and hel
met, he slipped over the ship's side.
At "mess gear" (meal time) he came
up, had his meal, and at 1:30 went
down again, remaining down until
''mess gear" sounded again.
For five days Johnson kept this up
and then the chief gunner grew a lit
tle bit suspicious. About 3 o'clock one
afternoon he ordered a second drvier's
suit "broken out." This he . donned
and went overboard. He came up in
about 10 minutes and so did Johnson.
When the cumbersome suits were re
moved the gunner ordered Johnson
"to the mast."

FAST PLACING EXHIBITS.
The old Flemish table and chairs
are made of stained redwood and the
table has a snowy white top â "sanded
top," it used to be culled. The effect
is unique and the furniture looks to
be very antique. The pictures accom
panying give a better idea than could
be conveyed in words.
The furniture for tHe first floor of
the San Francisco building is all sup
plied gratis by Dr. Orlow. Between
the Chinese and Japanese rooms will
be a pair of Chinese gate3 that were
brought from China â very ornate,
with history unknown. There are wall
brackets for the corridocs, reception
room and library. Among the curios
that will bo exhibited in the San Fran

feet in size, that will, when rolled up,
pass through a lady's bracelet. The
exhibit as a whole is well worth

SALT- LAKE. May 3.â Frederick
Zades is outfitting an expedition in
Darner. Nevada, to seek a lost gold

Eureka, Nevada. The story, as related
â¢ \>'i Zades, is as follows:
" â¢ Years ago Jchn C. Hawley. accom
panied by his wife, left Eureka and
traveled overland to Southern Utah
wijere. in Bull Valley, near the Moun

' gold float. He showed it to some of

Â£nÂ«l they put up a grub?take and sent
hfhi" to hurt the ledge. His efforts
Cefulted in his finding the ledge, the
ofe from which assayed many thou

â¢rvturr.ed with samples of the rock to
â¢â¢ ~h\s partr.^-ry. It via? so rich that th*>y
,.- tVspecte'J " fraud arsd refused to have
â¢"arj^thinlr more to do with it.
"*, Ha v ley returned to the claim and
dug* out a? much rock as he could
â¢ carry and took it to his wife. He
â¢ several trips and it was not long
till^his former partners reached the
â¢ eerjclusion that he real!;- had a. very
â¢ rich mine. Being no longer interested
â¢ with -Haw ley they conspired to obtain
â¢ the secret of the mine's location by
shadowing its owner, then to kill him.
"Â¦ m # Mrs % Hawley. however, learned of the

Speciml Dirpatch to Tbe *Cail,
Hypnotism has been a subject in
which Dr. Collins has been deeply in
terested for several years and he has
Ictel3 r been delivering lectures upon it
in* various parts of the country. So
strong a hold has it taken upon him
that he now believes that he has fallen
a victim to what is known as self
hypnosfs. "While his physical condition
is still good his mind is constantly sub
ject to the fear of death, as he ad
mitted to-day to Dr. Packer, who is in
charge of the insane pavilion.
Already the relief from anxiety, now
tbat the responsibility for his future
has been placed in other hands than
his own, has had a marked effect upon
him. As quietly as the most docile
patient in the hospital he remained in
bed to-day. The strain under which
he has been laboring having: relaxed
he suffered somewhat from nervous ex
haustion, but otherwise appeared to be
rational.
Unless Dr. Collins is willing to remain
he cannot be forcibly detained at the
hospital, as he walked in voluntarily.
NEW YORK, May 3.â Fears that he
will become a victim of self-hypnosis,
tbat he will appear to be dead and be

Henry Wadsworth, as receiver of
the bankrupt estate of Jacob and Her
man Eppinger and Bernard "Ettlinger,
filed a petition yesterday with United
States District Judge de Haven stat
ing thai on April 7 he had an unex
pended balance of $75,372 belonging
to the estate and that the creditors
had voted unanlmouslyln favor of de
claring a second dividend of 5 per
cent, which would use up that sum.
It was further set forth that on De
cember 21a dividend of 5 per cent had
been declared by Bankrupt Referee
Milton J. Green and that this also had
been acceptable to the. creditors. As
the law specifies that no dividend of
less than 10 per cent can be declared
without an order from the District
Judge, the petitioner asks Judge de
Haven Co make such an order.

The $30,000 estate of W. H. John
son, formerly of Xew Tork, Is the sub
ject of a dispute In the court in which
Public Administrator Hynes, Mrs-
Johnson, mother of the deceased: a
sister of the deceased, and a woman
named Mrs. Sutro are the contestants.
The battle opened yesterday with the
procurement from Judge Sloss by
Hynes of an order directing Attorney
W. F. Williamson to file the will of
the decedent.
It appears from the documents al
ready filed by the Public Administra
tor that Johnson, when he died here
two years ago. left a will in" which he
devised his estate to his mother and
his sister and to Mrs. Sutro, the latter
to receive half and the mother and
sister each a quarter. The will was
left in the possession of Williamson,
who after communicating with the
relatives ot the deceased, received in
structions to withhold the will from
the files. He did so. and when the
Public Administrator, who only re
cently learned of the existence of the
testament, made a demand that it b'
produced Williamson still withheld,
filing it only when Judge Sloss' order
was served upon him.
The devise to Mrs. Sutro appears to
be the cause of the opposition to tho
will by Mrs. Johnson and her daugh
ter. No one seenjs to know who she
Is, and it i3 expected that when she
makes her appearance in the case in
teresting'developments will arise.

The estate of the jockey is valued
at about $2500 and, according to the
sister, Greenock is rightfully an asset
of the estate. She says that owing to
a request of her father she failed to
include him as a part of the estate in
her first inventory.
OAKLAND, May 3. â Whether the
good race horse Greenock belongs to
the estate of the late Jockey Woods
or is the property of the lad's father.
William Woodsi is the subject of a
family quarrel in Judge Greene's de
partment of the Sunerior Court. Mary
A. Mithell, a sister of deceased, says
the horse belonged to the boy, while
the father and a second son say the
horse is the property of the father.
The amount of money earned by the
little jockey was one of the points
brought out, and it was shown that
he received about $12,000 a year in
the employ of the Schorrs. The sis
ter maintains that the money -of her
brother went to help the father, who
owned several horses, among which
are Sherry, Marplot, Lecturer and
McAlbert and which failed to win suf
ficient to pay for their keeping.

At a recent meeting of the Black
Point Improvement Club the following
resolutions were adopted and ordered
forwarded to the Board of Supervisors
and the Board of Police Commissioners:
We, the undersigned, citizens and taxpayers
of the city and county of San Francisco, here
by very respectfully petition the honorable
Board of SuDervisors of this city and county
to the end that proper and sufficient police
protection be eiven our city and county; and
Whereas, O.ur police force under existing
circumstances is entirely inadequate to prop
erly police the city as it should be done; and
Whereas. The district at the north end of
the city is sorely in need of police service
which cannot be furnished by the police au
thorities with the present force on hand; and
Whereas. The budget expenses of the next
fiscal year will very shortly be fixed by the
Board of Supervisors; and
Whereas, The life of no man, woman or
child is safe after sunset at any night, and
hold-ups, robberies and burglaries are of such
common occurrence In this, the north end of
our great city, as to keep good and desirable
citizens from investing in property " at thiÂ»
end of the citv and county on account of an
utter lack of police protection; therefore be it
Resolved, ! Th*t we, the members of the
Black Point Improvement Club of San Fran
cisco, heartily and earnestly advocate to the
honorable Board of Supervisors an Increase
of - the police force of this city and county
to the extent as to be sufficient to patrol this
much neglected district of the North End
as It should be patrolleA, so as to give
the residents of the North End that
same .protection by day and night which is
now accorded downtown districts and some
parts of the Mission, but not In any part of
tho North End, from the Intersection of Val
lejo street to the seawall, to the Fulton Iron
Works and any part south and west of that
Una at the entire I&igth of California street;
and be It further
Resolved, That petitions be signed from this
date on by all Interested citizens of this dis
trict, and a copy of this petition and the an
nexed signatures be submitted to the proper
committee of the Board of Supervisors, to his
Honor the Mayor, Eugene E. Schmltz,' also
to the Board of Police Commissioners and the
Chief of Police and the dally newspapers, by

Decrees of divorce were granted to
Lizzie Winders from David Winders
for neglect and Leah H. Lyons from
Alexander Lyons for neglect.
Suits for divorce were filed by John
W. Fear against Phoebe J. Fear for
cruelty and Ida M. Rohner against
Frank G. Rohner, a musician, for cru
elty.
Judge Murasky yesterday granted a
motion to reopen the maintenance suit
of Evelyn Marchand against Edward
Marchand, of restaurant fame. The
attorneys in the case desired an op
portunity to present argument on law
points involved, hence the court's or
der. The suit is the result of the pub
lication by Marchand of a notice that
he would no longer be responsible for
his wife's debts. She asks for $300 a
month.
Through the efforts of Judge Gra
ham the divorce action brought by
May Keith against Chester Keith on
the ground of desertion has been dis
missed and a reconciliation effected.
They were married at Colorado
Springs in November. 1902. In the
following April they came to this city
to reside. After a short time they
had a slight quarrel and separated
and then came the suit for divorce.
When they appeared In court a few
days ago their testimony showed that
neither was very anxious for a di
vorce, so Judge Graham suggested
that the case be continued and he also
suggested that efforts be made to
bring the young people together
again. The efforts were made, as was
evidenced by the dismissal of the suit
yesterday.
Young People Take Judge Graham's
Advice and Settle Their Differ
ences Without Divorce.

Perhaps J. Morley might have copped j
another baseball game yesterday had
ecifle cne shanghaied ponderous Wil
liam Massey on the road between San
Frantisco and the beautiful little vil
lage of Golden Gate. But the shanghai
mefl were not working yesterday, and
therefore Mr. Massey arrived in time
â¢to come up with the club twice and to
. cjout the ball hard enough to clear the
bags each time. Score â San Francisco
â¢ 6, Los Angeles 2.
â¢ . The first big sensation was pulled off
ere the game had become more than a
: "few minutes old. Hildebrand opened it
iyj with a single to right, and Waldron
and Meany stuns 6afely also, filling the
bags, with no one down. Irwin forced
Hildebrand at the plate and Leahy
Firuck out, so it looked good for Mr.
Kangaroo Baum till Massey swung
tttrough with that three-time wallop to
. center and let every one come in.
Then the game was a dead one for
several rounds. Baum got busy and
'. better all the time and none of the lo
cals could approach his sazzlers till the
. oighth. Then there were some more big
â¢ doings. With two gone, Meany smashed
a double along the right field line, and
-Irwin responded with a drive to left
.that brougrht the run in. Leahy was
: passed, and again Massey was there
vith a triple, which finished up the
day's work. It should have been a
"liomer, but the umpire said "out" at
" the rlate. although Big Bill slid under
the throw.
The Angels got theirs on errors all
â¢ t-he lime, arid could not hit the
l>all at the right time. In fact, they
.displayed that lack of walloping abil
ity that has been their weakness from
â¢Tr? ftart. "Whenever there was & run
ner on the ba-Â«es each and every bats
ir.an tried to kill the ball, and conse
quently no runs happened. The score:

PORTLAND, Or., May 3.â Oakland
played a wonderful uphill game to-day
and won in the tenth inning. The scores
came one at a time and, like drawing
teeth, in the face of a big lead gained
by Portland in the third. Young
Buchanan was not altogether to blame
for the burst of speed shown by the
home team. Moskiman's rank errors
helped present the runs. After the third
Buchanan settled down and pitched
championship ball. The score: .
Portland â ' Oakland â
Two objections were filed to the al
leged record. It was claimed, first, that
the trial was not properly advertised;
second, that the mile was made in
about 2:05 and wrongly announced at
1:59%, giving the stallion a mark not
rightfully his. A considerable number
of horsemen who held watches on Cres
ceus are alleged to have caught his
time all the way from 2:04% to 2:06.
Those who made the fight against the
allowance of the alleged record claimed
that all three of the watches which
took the horse's time were borrowed
watches, and that not one was held by
an experienced timer. They also de
clare thisâ a most significant circum
stance, if well foundedâ that each of
the timers has declared that all three
watches caught each quarter in the
same time. Not among the best and
most experienced timers In the United
States has there ever been known such
a condition of affairs. The best watches
and the best timers will catch the quar
ters a fifth or a quarter of a second
apart.
CHICAGO, May 3.â The board of ap
peals of the American Trotting Asso
ciation at a meeting here to-day re
fused to recognize the record of 1:59%
claimed to have been made by the trot
ter Cresceus on the grounds of the
Wichita Fair last fall. The finding of
the association follows: ; f J
"From the evidence submitted by the
Southern Kansas Fair Association.
Wichita, Kans^ and George Ketcham,
Toledo, we find that the performance
of Cresceus on the grounds of the
Wichita Fair Association on the 19th
of October, 1903, was not conducted in
accordance with the rules of the Amer
ican Trotting Association governing
performances against time, and that
the time of 1:59% then and there
claimed to have been made by said
horse is neither a record nor a bar un
der the said rules.
"It Is therefore ordered and deter
mined that the application to establish
such record be and the same Is hereby
denied."

NEW YORK, May 3.â The feature
event at Jamaica racetrack to-day re
suted in the biggest turf sensation of
years. Lady Amelia, carrying VIZ
pounds and favorite in the betting at -
to 1 for the Wllliamsburg handicap, a
spring affair for three-year-olds, ran a
dead heat with Jacquin.
Johnson's colt was in at 118 pounds,
and under a superb ride by O'Xeill he
lasted Just long enough to get a deci
sion of a dead heat with the Thomas
fllly. Thomas did not want to run off
the race, being willing: to split the
purse. As Johnson was confident hla
colt could win, he refused this offer.
At the start In the run-off Jacquin
jumped into the lead shortly after the
barrier was snapped and remained
there to the end, winning easily by five
lengths. Johnson had 52500 on his colt
to win. and before the run-off he offered
to bet $5000 even that Jacquin would
defeat the filly.
Outside this race there was no note
worthy feature to the card. Only one
favorite won. although the track condi
tions were excellent. A big crowd wit
nessed the races. Summary:
First race, six furlongs â Rob Roy won.
Young Henry second. Gay Lothario third.
Time. 1 :ia 3-5.
Second race, four and a half furlong* â St.
Bel'ane won. Melrcse second. Nevadan third.
Time. :55.

With Nullah, Vasallo, Solon and
Louis Wagner out of the way, Rey
Dare looked the most eligible of the
six starters in the seven-furlong selling
number. The Nealon entry enjoyed first
call, but later, when a heavy play came
in on Mocorito, it was 2 to 1 and take
your pick. The latter mare at no time
looked dangerous. Tom Slavin made
a'll the running, and it took hard urg
ing on the part of C. Kelly to get Rey
Dare up In time to win by less than a
length. Moor was third.
If Crosswaite, who rode IHHouon, fa
vorite for the concluding mile and sev
enty yard event, had not been given a
whip the chances are Billy Randall's
gelding would have won. As It was,
Roach made all the running with
Hainault, downing the favorite by less
than a length in a driving finish. Cross
waite drew his whip a furlong from
home, whereas if he had resorted to
handriding the decision would unques
tionably have been reversed. The show
fell to J. V. Kirby.
NOTES OF TIIE TRACK.

REY DARE JUST LANDS.
Cassie W, from the stable of James
Nealon, was served fresh off the coals
for the introductory sprint. The mare
closed an S to 5 favorite and after
showing speed for about a sixteenth of
a mile, faded away to a" whisper. Maud
Muller looked all over a winner, \vhen_
Roach, on Rustic Girl, closed with a'
rush, earning a nose decision. Joe
Jones, astride Step Around, took the
show.
No doubt if Jones -was carded to ride
a Government mule his mount would
be installed favorite. This is a high
tribute to the lad's skill, but misleading
at times. , Joe had the leg up on Meada,
which opened an 8 to 6 choice for the
two-year-old scramble. The fllly looked
a scarecrow, and her price receded to
13 to 5. She ran a poor race. Cloud
light, an 8 to 1 shot, with Reed in the
saddle, ran away from her company,
winning hands down from Head Dance
in 4SU seconds. Marie J finished third.
McBride landed Gold Finder first for
the mile selling affair. The gelding
went to the post a 6 to 5 favorite, and
overhauling the pacemaker, Chlleno,
the last eighth crossed the line first by
a length. Harry Beck, which lost
ground by bolting at the start, came
from the rear, running third.
CASSIE \V FADES AW.AY.
Splendid racing weather and an at
tractive card drew a large attendance.
The track was fast and three favorites
picked up purses.
The "yaller" horse, Money Muss,
sporting: the colors of Ed Gaylord, the
wealthy Denverite, and Mlsty's Pride,
the crack" Oregon-bred mare from Sam
Jones' stable, locked horns in the Fu
turity course sprint at Oakland yes
terday and victory rested with the for
mer when the dust had cleared away.
The .betting favored Money Muss at
odds of 7 to 5. and he was well ridden
by Jones.
For a time Misty's Pride showed in
the lead, then the favorite assumed
charge of affairs and, though both were
tiring badly at the end, the latter
reached the wire first by nearly a
length. As the race was run, John A.
Scott, with good handling, would have
scored, but the show was the best he
got.

board the heads c-f the different de
partments in charge of the curing,
packing and shipping of the season's
salmon catch. During the salmon sea
son the at-other-times deserted can

ly populated, bustling communities.
The sailing vessels, some sixty of

sanitarium near San Mateo. Captain
Bradley's three little children have

The many friends of Captain Joseph
A. Sladen. U. S. A., retired, will regret
to learn of his serious illness. From
the Pacific to the Atlantic his name is
broadly known in army circles. He
has been a gallant soldier in the army

country he lost his right leg. His pres
ent malady is the result of nervous in
digestion.

â¢ â¢." HONOLULU, April 26.â Sunken rocks
.irt tjie path of sailing vessels plying
â¢ *i)Â£nveen San Francisco and Honolulu
..and San Francisco and Tahiti may
*h 8Ve been- the cause of the mysterious
-<i of many vessels in the
Y.fnter time. These rocks do not now
;l;<-^r. on charts of the Pacific Ocean,
â¢ >et..;heir existence was vouched for
uk>re- than half a century ago.
/â¢Cap.tain B. F. Chapman, formerly a
resident' Of Tahiti and now of llono
; lifplq. who was a ship captain in the
trade for many years, be
-Jlieves that these sunken rocks, if
[found, would clear up many mysteries
'/â¢f Cie-sca. In commenting: upon the
Viispatjches announcing that the Gov
oiVimext- would FTid the new cruiser
" Tfcfonia. to search for a "lost" island
â¢ between Pan Francisco and Tahiti, he
..saidf
,f* -"As far- hack as lSiO a low land was
. JUisgovered bv the bark Du Mont de
Vii'.e on a voyape from San Francisco
'Â¦ -to' Ta'Hi.ti. but I don't think it has ever
br-^ri Â¦Fcffi Fiiicc. Captain Kennie of

&gei pfghted a Fhoal which is not on

â¢ * i i T-i s a^bout the vessel his discovery
/jryJicateil ttiat an island must have
fbi-cn bomewhere -in the vicinity. When
â¢l'Va'< a sea captain my chart had a
? option to the effect that a "cluster

â¢ivctcfied for. The chart Kave them

-*Â«uxd -then afterward no one can lo
'Â¦"'â¢ate'it.'
â¢ 'â¢â¢ WARSHIP IS WRECKED.
Â¦^â¢â¢Tnere is a group of sunken islands
. -between Honolulu and San Francisco,
F.OTvever. which it would be well worth
Â¦ the*""CJovernmenfs time and money to
'- !V>Â£ate. The. location should be put on
â¢' ttoji charts, for I believe that in the
. r.vtpter -gales many vessels which have
yfiypteriously disappeared have run
[â¢ppon these sunken peaks and gone
Ftraight to the bottom. A United States
Floop cf* war left Honolulu for Panama
" eomewhere in the early fifties, and was
Veser heard of again. But one piece of
.%Vfeck4Â£:e was ever found to indicate
" Â¦f.rrat became of the warship. I believe
.Ifrat she ran on this group of sunk
en" rocks', with everything lashed, and
wc : n*t;dewn with everything and every
body-on board.
. 'J'Dne of these rocks is thr^e fathoms
from the surface and the next peak is
JivÂ£ fathoms. They are difficult to lo
pglC for .the water does not always
break over -them.
" "Tlse sunken rock is known to me
â¢ ;':s Heflit'fs Rock, named after a vessel
.\'hlch discovered it. and which flew
Â»tK : -Tahitian flag. When I was last in
I Tahiti I determined to "ascertain more
ab^'ut this rock.
". "'.In.* lÂ£50' the schooner Hana, bound
frn'rn San Francisco to Papeete, located
\Uo- sun.ken rock. The vessel hove to
'â¢is/icl sent out a boat. The distance to
thÂ«? highest peak was ascertained to be
'ii^ouU'five fathoms.

. "O'ne of the crew in that boat was

â¢ To -m-y rx r st memory he states that the

THE FUTURE REVEALED. THE PAST

The Present Analyzed by Livingstone.
PROF. LIVINGSTONE'S readlnzs are like
a living pace of Flammarion's treatise that Is
eo electrifying t-he world to-day. Ho Is no
lmltatir. HiÂ« work Is utton original lines,
pure thought, clear vision. He tells you what
you desire to know and works In the open
light.
He 1Â« as conspicuous for his wonderful occult
analysis .is he Is for his original expression
and vivid truthfulness.
A test reading is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full life reading for $1. A test
Is of little value; when the mind is troubled
you need more substantial aid and advice.
Tills is Just what PROF. LIVINGSTONE
gives you wnen you call on him for a first-
class clairvoyant reading. ".
He asks you no questions, but tells you
what you wish to know.
He doeÂ« not mention all the Ills and mis-
fortunes you are lulr to. You are acquainted
with the facts In your case. Let PROF. LIV-
INGSTONE analvz 1 ? the matters that are
troubling you, find the cause of trouble and
suggest the remedy.

Let uÂ« pray that Russia may win. Such
should be the fervent prayer of every pious
and patriotic Australian. Â¦ On the issue of the
war between Russia and Japan hangs the des
tiny of white Australia. This conflict between
thn white Christian and the brown pagan con
stitutes the supreme crisis of Australia's na
tional fate. It is not only a struggle between
two nations: It is the Inevitable clashing of
the civilization of the weiÂ«t with that of the
oast â a duel to the death which shall decide for
this side of the future whether Kuropean ideas
and Christian civilization or Asiatic ideas and
pagan barbaripm shall dominate this hemi
sphere.
Later, in a -public address at Sydney,
he said:
What would become of 'Australia if China
again, as in the thirteenth century, found its
own Gordon \ or Julius Caesar, or, Napoleon?
Where would the brunt of the first attack fall?
Upon Australia as one of the moot neglected
outposts of the empire. And neglected by
whom? Not so much by the imperial authori
ties as by the Australians .themselves.
They took more interest In a cricket or football
match, or in tho race for the Melbourne Cup
than they did !n thn great question of the su
premacy of the white race.
Things political are rather quiet in

There is a strong pro-Russian senti
ment in the commonwealth. John Nor

There is much comment on the meth
ods in vogue of handling fruits, which
are very unsatisfactory to buyers and
entail waste and loss on the growers.
The Sydifcy Herald says:
Generally speaking, the fruits sent in are
not properly "got up" for sale. Grading and
packing are effectively carried out by the few.
bui If ever tr^e cold storage of fruit develops
sufficiently to allow of our soft fruits being
sent to London there will need to be immense
improvements In methods of handling and
packing. A striking object lesson was afford
ed laat year by the condition In which stone
and other eoft fruits arrived In . Sydney from
America. These fruits were packed so that
each specimen had a space to Itself.
It strongly recommends the general
adoption of the American plan.
The first-class twin screw armored
cruiser Euryalus, which under the new
naval agreement has replaced H. M. S.
I Royal Arthur as flagship on the Aus
tralian station, arrived at Sydney April
j S and mo6red at the Royal Arthur's
buoy In Farm Cove.
The gross imports of Australia,
amounting to Â£26,770,000, exceed the
aggregate exports by Â£29.000, indicat
ing that the state has absorbed more
capital.
A writer in the Sydney Herald calls
attention to the mining situation in the
following words: 'That the mining in
dustry in Australia has fallen on evil
days is, unfortunately, but too evident.
In Western Australia the returns for
the past year have been remarkably
good, nevertheless there has not been
the activity there that there should
have been. On this side of the conti
nent mining is practically dead, and
the miner is wandpring about the land
desperate at the present condition of
affairs and full of pessimism as to the
future. Lyell, Cobar, Gun'dagai, .Wya
long. Orange, New Englandâ all are
quiescent. Charters Towers is about
the most active field, and it is not too
bright. Noting all this, one naturally
asks two questions. One Is as to what
has caused this stagnation, and the
other as to whether the position is like
ly to improve again.
The question of lessening the dangers
and facilitating the navigation of the
port of Sydney by means of Increased
lighting arrangements and by the es
tablishment of fog bells on prominent
parts of the harbor has been under the
consideration of the Harbor Trust
Commissioners since the appointment
of the trust. The Commissioners had
formulated an elaborate scheme, which
owing to scarcity of funds could not be
carried out. A part of it has, however,
been inaugurated by the installation of
an acetylene gas plant on Shark Isl
and in lieu of the kerosene light.
The State Secretary for Agriculture,
in a memorandum on the question, says
that as regards the success that at
tended the bonuses offered in Victoria
there could not, he thought, be any
doubt so far as the butter and fruit In
dustries were concerned, but satisfac
tory progress had not been made in the
extension of some of the other indus
tries. The development of new indus
tries was, however, he remarked, usu
ally a slow process under any condi
tions. The bonus given for the estab
lishment of butter factories and cream
eries, and for the export of the surplus
output from % their inception of the mod
ern Bystem of dairying, had greatly
stimulated the development of this In
dustry, and since 1888 Victoria had ex
ported upwards of 12,000,000 pounds of
butter and cheese. .The cost of market
ing the butter had been brought down
greatly. â¢
INTEREST IN FRUIT GROWING.
The Federal Government has under
consideration for submission to Parlia
ment a bill providing bounties to rural
industries. The plan has already been
In practice in Victoria for some years.
Good rains fell during the early part
of the month over the greater part of
New South Wales and were especially
welcome to agriculturists and pastor
alists alike. Â«
The annual show of the Royal Agri
cultural Society of New South Wales
was officially opened by his Excellency
the 'Governor General Lord Northcote
on April 1 with appropriate ceremonies
and speeches. The showing of'live
stock was especially good and the at
tendance was in advance of that of
former years. The ' Sydney Morning
Herald says:
As the year extends the effects of the break
up of the drouth are makine themselves ap
parent in an Increase of the public revenue.
Fur March the Increase of Â£147,000 was greater
than that for any other month, while Â£1,095,
000, the total amount, exceeded that of every
oflier month except February, the return In
â¢which usually is swollen by land tax receipts.
In the first quarter of. the calendar year the
revenue was Â£283,000 In excess of the ag
gregate for the like period of l'J03.
LONDON, May 3. â Quite a little
breeze was raised in the House of
Commons during the discussion of the
budget resolution increasing the duties
on tobacco and cigars by Reginald
McKenna (Liberal), who Insinuated
that the Chancellor of the Exchequer
had been Influenced by Joseph Cham
berlain's tariff commission and a cer
tain tobacco merchant who would
reap a direct benefty from an Increased
duty on stripped tobacco. McKenna
remarked on the extraordinary In
creases in the importation of unstrlp
ped tobacco in March by this repre
sentative of the tobacco trade, who
Is a member of the tariff commission.
Both the Chancellor of the Ex
chequer, Austen Chamberlain, and his
father jumped up and heatedly de
manded that McKenna should formu
late his charges in express terms.
McKenna then disclaimed the slightest
intention of imputing anything dis
honorable to the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, but maintained that it waa
remarkable that a member of Cham
berJain's commission correctly antici
pated what the budget proposals were
going to be.
CROWDED TRAINS COMING.
Fifteen trainloads of Methodists are
due to-morrow, and some of the be
lated sections probably will not get in
until the next day; but the work of
the convention will be started on time,
and such work as can be done disposed
of according to ' programme.
The Bishops' special arrived to-day
from the north. It was met fifty miles
north by a committee bearing flowers
and fruits. Other committees went to
San Bernardino and Colton, where
wagon loads of oranges and flowers
will be freely distributed* among the
passengers of all the specials as they
arrive. The delight of the first ar
rivals at this reception was unbound
ed. After days of travel over deserts
and plains they gave every evidence of
their joy at being thus remembered.
The most important ante-convention
business transacted to-day was at a
meeting of the general committee of
the Methodist Book Concern. The con
ference will be called upon to consider
the proposition of consolidating thl3
concern, but this will be strenuously
opposed â¢ by , the -minority of the com
mittee and a minority report is being
prepared. The question will be fought
out in the General Conference. The
conference will be composed of 748 dele
gates, one-half of that number being
ln.y delegates. Of the lay delegates, for
the first time in the history of the
church, twenty-five will be women, one
of them a colored woman. The con
ference will be in session nearly a
month.
"We divided what food there was to
eat, but all Sunday night we were
without food and the supply of water
was scant. It became necessary to
construct a track around the wreck In
order to let out the trains ahead and
Sunday afternoon trainmen, ranchers,
cattlemen and clergymen toiled at that
work. That was literally a Methodist
track, for scores of clergymen worked
with pick and shovel. They had to
do it, for there In a strange country
stood cars containing 3000 people
without food and the question of get
ting something to eat was serious.
"All Sunday night we tolled, every
able-bodied 'man lending a hand, while
the women, God bless them, stood by
and encouraged us. There was no
complaining, and from time to time
some brother would start a hymn,
and there among the sagebrush and
cactus the song would be taken up
with a will while the toiling ministers
kept a cadence with their picks and
shovels. It was an experience never
to be forgotten, and I doubt if such a
scene was ever duplicated. It was
daylight Monday before the track was
completed and the first of the specials
pulled out for Los Angeles, those who
went first singing such songs as 'God
Be With You Till We Meet Again, 1
and those behind answering with such
songs as 'There Is a Land of Pure De
light.' After that we made good
time."
"Sunday afternoon seven sections
filled with delegates and their families
arrived at the canyon. The cars were
heavily loaded and when the trains
began the ascent of the Williams grade
several engines went dead and under
one of the rear sections the track gave
way, throwing the train into the ditch.
Those aboard the trains, numbering
close to 3000, went to the canyon
hotel. The, manager had expected
about 800 and there was not food
enough for more than that. The result
waa that hundreds went hungry.
HARDSHIP OX JOURXEY.
LOS ANGELES, May 2.â To-morrow
morning at 8:30 o'clock the thirty-first
General Conference of the Methodist
Episcopal church will be called to or
der by Bishop Merrill in Hazard's Pa
vilion, but owing to the delay of many
trainloads of delegates it is almost cer
tain that the first day's proceedings
will have to be abridged. Only one of
the seventeen special trains due here
last night and this morning had arrived
up to 7 o'clock to-night, and throughout
the night train after train arrived at 2
hour intervals and the weary delegates
sought rest from a trip which for many
of them had taken a week or more.
The first arrivals told of the harrow
ing experiences which hundreds of
them had at the Grand Canyon of the
Colorado, where one of the specials
was wrecked and there was almost a
tragedy. Dr. S. W. Thomas, editor of
the Philadelphia Methodist, gave a
description of how Methodist clergy
men turned in with pick and shovel
there and assisted in rebuilding a rail
road track. He said:

DOUBTS MOTIVE
0F CHAMBERLA1N
The murder charge against William
B. Kennedy, alias Richard Jackson,
alias "Yellow," in connection with the
slaying: of Policeman Eugene C. Rob
inson at Sixteenth and Valencia streets
on the morning of January 21, 1902.
after many vicissitudes will be dis
missed by Judge Cook this fnorning.
George R. Aikyo. the Japanese,' whose
evidence was supposed to corroborate
that of William Henderson, one of the
other thugs charged with killing Rob
inson, was taken before the Judge yes
terday morning and after telling what
happened to him when Kennedy at
tempted to hold him up ji few min
utes prior to Robinson's murder the
Judge decided there was nothing to
show that Kennedy was implicated in
the murder.
The reason for taking Alkyo before
the Judge prior to May 9. the date set
for the trial, was because Aikyo is a
commissioner from Japan to the St.
Louis Exposition and he is being kept
here at considerable expense and may
lose his concession at the exposition.
Chief Wittman will furnish him with
a letter to the Chief 'of Police at St.
Louis explaining the cause of his tar
diness and asking that the exposition
commissioners be notified of the facta.
Aikyo has given his testimony at the
preliminary hearing before Police
Judge Cabaniss on the charge of as
sault to rob against Kennedy. This
can be read at the trial if Kennedy is
held.

EASTERN MARKETS.--
The movement in Raisins is better since the
differences in the trade have been settled
and the new prices fixed, but the market Is not
lively, and brokers say that some carry-over
Is expected. A carry-over in Prunes is also
anticipated. The latter continue dull and
cheap. Peaches are the leaders in interest at
the moment, and will clean up. They rule'
very firm. Nuts are steady and pretty well
cleaned up. In fact, as frequently reported,
there is not much stock of anything left ex
cept Prunes and Raisins. There is nothing
new In Honey, the market being quiet.

The- first Cherrles^of the 'season appeared
from Courtland on th?'t*acramento River. They
were of the Purple- Oulgne variety Â»nd of
good size and well matured. One 10-lb drawer
came in during the early trade and was sold
to. a leading retailer for $5. and two drawers,
each containing the same quantity, brought
by a later boat, sold at the same price. Re
ceipts of .Strawberries were the heaviest thus
far this season, aggregating 211 chests, cf
which 147 were of the large varieties from
Watsonvllle. Dealers had firm Ideas at th*
opening and asked $15 for Longwortbs and |1O
for the large varieties, but buyers refused to
pay such figures and prices receded. There
were quite a few chests lying around unsold
at the close. Six crates of a large variety
came ln from Florin and sold at $1 per crate.
Previously stated conditions still prevailed
In Citrus fruits. A fair amount of business,
both locally and for shipping account, was re
ported in good sound Navels, while there was
the usual pressure to sell inferior stock, which
constituted a large portion of the supplies.
Ripe Bananas were more plentiful and the
Central American article was quoted lower.
The other fruits were without quotable chang>\
STRAWBERRIESâ $8<312 per . chest for
Longworths and $4Â®7 for the larger varieties.

CHICAGO, May 3.â Almost Ideal weather
throughout the greater part of the country
ceu?ed liquidation of wheat at the opening. In
consequence of the heavy selling pressure In
itial sales were made at a considerable decline,
July being off to %c at 83-%c to 84V4c.
There were other factors that entered into the
situation In the weather conditions. Amons
the more Important influences were reports
from the Northwest stating that seeding oper
ations were progressing rapidly. Weakness of
the grain market at Minneapolis and Duluth
seemed to substantiate Uuubearlsh advices in
regard to the seeding and helped to accentuate
th& degression here. A rumor Â¦ that the Mis
souri' crop report, to be issued to-morrow,
Would show an imitrovement in condition of
srowlnj wheat, Increased the desire to sell,
l-'or the first hour the market ruled extremely
weak, losses of nearly a cent being made in
all deliveries. The low point on July waa re
ported at ti'.i%c. The selllns craze, however,
was too unanimous, and as a result the market
became oversold. Many of the early sellers
started to cover. A sharp rally followed.
Buying on a larce scale by a prominent com
mission house was supposed to be for the ac
count of a leadlnjr trader. During the â¢ latter
part of the session the buying continued lib
eral and the market held strong. After sell
ing at WJic July closed at 84Vjc
Influenced by favorable weather and a de
cline ln wheat, the corn market showed Con
siderable weakness durlr~ the first part of the
session, but the close was firm. July un
chanfed at 47 7 /Â«Â©48c.
Oats were influenced by the action of other
rralns. July closed Uc lower at 3Â«%c.
Provisions were wenk under active selling
by packers and exporters. .There was a firm
opening on the bullish ho2*iuarket. but the
early weakness in grains brought out influen
tial celling, resulting in a gradual decline.
Perk closed with a net lo?s of 30c. lard was

From testimony taken in our investigation
of this case we find that the steamship Mon
golia, .1. H. Kinder master, from Norfolk,
Va,. to San Francisco. Cal., was running along
the coast in order to verify the chronometers.
At 3:K5 p. . m. March 6 the vessel struck on a
reef or shoal. The weather was clear, the
â¢wind light . and the sea smooth. Soundings
taken around the vessel showed five fathoms
near .the â¢ bow, five and a half fathoms on
each side amidships and eight fathoms, aft.
The tide wan about half flood: vessel was
drawinp 27 feet forward and 28 feet aft. At
4:25 p. m. the vessel floated. Â¦Â¦
. The following . bearings were taken at. the
time the vessel was aground: Sellelro Point,
N.29 W.; Ollnda Lighthouse, S. 43 W., true.
By the chart these bearings locate the ship In
fifteen fathoms of water and four' miles out
side of the Hve-fathom line of soundings along
the | land. There are - no indications on the
chart of a reef or shoal water in this .vicinity.

The. California buDuIng has a facade
100 feet long. The depth of the main
structure is 45 feet. At the back is a
lecture hall, 40x35 feet in size. The floor

from the assembly hall are the men's
parlor and women's parlor. Back of the
assembly hall is the office and informa

building the rooms are arranged in
suites for the accommodation- Â¦ of the
commissioners, the secretary of the com

CALIFORNIA AT THE EX POSITION
A Very Pretty Art Supplement, "Cali
fornia .Building" at the St. Louis
.,.Â¦Â¦ Exposition, Free With Next
Sunday's Call.
The" Cnlifornia State building at th*e
I-ouisiana Purchase Exposition, at St.
Louis, stands on a hill, in a conspicuous
position,'' near. .the center of the Exposi
tion grouqj^ While there are many re
markable btiilciinps that will attract the
attention of millions of visitors while
the "Exposition sates are open, there is
not one that, has more intrinsic interest
than the California building.
It is a reproduction, with preat fidelity
to detail, of the famous Santa Barbara
Mission. To- make the. reproduction per
fect -the front has been chipped and
stained and grass seeds have been sown
betw'een the flagstone pavements, that
the ravages of time and the characteris
tics to the most minute 'degrees may be
presented to the spectator, who may
thereby see a vista of historical interest
exactly in accordance with the original.
The story is current that no woman
has b'2en allowed to enter the -garden of
th<? Santa ' Barbara Mission, although
there may have been a few exceptions.
At St. Louis the famous garden is en
tirely reproduced. The fountain is in the
center; the old wooden benches are imi
tated and are placed as in the Santa Bar
bara Mission garden. The same varieties
of plants that have bloomed for more
than a century for the padres of Santa
Barbara will make up the garden show
at St. 1 Louis. Superintendent McLaren
of Gold*n Gate Park has been given
charge of the collection of such plants.
Samuel -Newsom, the architect of the
building, visited Santa Barbara several
times and made a study of the garden,
as well as of the building aniTlts sur
roundings, for exposition purposes.

that men pass up the pipe and the
' fireside when the bonfire burns at the
corner! Yesterday the women of the
California Club knew, how it felt to be
.Jn the thick of a fightâ an elective
fight, of courseâ a regular neck-and
neck affair, where the two sides were
solidly lined up â In perfect sisterly
. spirit, to be sure â but with an awful
determination to win.
For three months the political pot's
been boiling:, with the leaders of the
two tickets poking the embers, and
yesterday the fun was on. An emenda
â¢ tJon her*>. however. Is necessary in the
Interests of truthâ Mrs. Orr, the presl
" dectial candidate on the second ticket,
resolutely refrained from soliciting
Votes, but that's not 6aylngr that her â¢
friends were afflicted with the same
degree of modesty. They hustled In
tbe lobby, and extended the Jubilant
hand to the incoming members in true
campaign fashion. So did the Cotton
contingent! I>d by Mrs. Lovell White,
Â¦votes were policlted with all the elo
quence at the command of the former
presidentâ who, by the way, has not
vteited the club for a year, but whose
popularity certainly had not waned
* among her former supporters.
At 2 o'clock the polls were opened, j
'At 5. when they closed, 286 votes had I
been cast, the largest number yet re
corded in the annals of the club. Of
that number three of the first ticket,
and two of the second, were straight
"I tickets, and yet every nominee on the
first ticket was elected. Now, what
Hn you think of that? Herewith is the
resultâ watched and waited for by a ;
hundred anxious women until 10:30 by
the town clork (what their husbands
had to gay when they got home would
be interesting! Perhaps we shall hear
next dub day):

The vote was announced by Dr. |
Minora Kibbe. chairman of the nom

th*> official announcement was undra- ,
i.iatic and tame â the most interesting
feature, perhaps, being the pretty con

Politics is fun! Small -wonder It is
Collins intimates that he will make
it interesting for Commissioner Hutton.
He says that it was an absurd propo
sition for the Commissioners to appoint
one of their number "Special Chief -of
Police," as there can be but one Chief
of Police while that officer is within
the confines of the city and county. If
the Chief had been absent from the
city they could have appointed Hutton
acting Chief or special chief, but not
Attorney George D. Collins, who is
looking after Pon's interests, learned
of the mysterious visit of the two -po
licemen early yesterday morning, and
surmising their object, warned Judge
Cabaniss that he would make himself
amenable to the higher court for con
tempt if he issued the warrants for the
arrest of the women, which was the
cause of the Judge's refusal to ifuttnn.
Collins also laid the matter before
Judge Cook and the Judge issued cita
tions for Barrv and DavidsÂ»to appear
before him this morning to sh<.-\v cause
why they should not be punished for
contempt.
JUDGE IS WARNED.
Hutton evolved a scheme to thwart
the injunction. He called a secret
meeting of the Police Commissioners
for Saturday afternoon, without in
forming Chief Wittman, who had been
served with a copy of the injunction,
and at that meeting Hutton was by
resolution appointed "Special Chief of
Police for 1129 Dupdnt street."
Armed with this authority Hutton
sent for Policemen Barry and Davids,
and acting upon his instructions they
donned civilian attire and about 2
o'clock yesterday morning climbed to
the roof of 1125 Dupont street. They
descended by means of a ladder and
climbed over fer.ces till they reached
the houses of ill fame in the rear of
Pon's restaurant. They kept them
selves from observation, as they
thought, and took notes of what they
saw.
The two officers reported the result
of their adventure to Hutton, who call
ed at the Bond and Warrant Clerk's
office yesterday morning and secured
a bunch of blank complaints and war
rants of arrest for the women inmates
of the houses in the rear of Pon's res
taurant. He filled in the complaints
and warrants and went before Police
Judge Cabaniss to have them sworn
to. Much to his chagrin and disap
pointment the Judge declined to sign
them.
EVOLVES HIS SCHEME.
Police Commisloner H. "W. Hutton
conceived and carried out a brilliant
scheme which will probably result in
two policemen being sent to jail for
contempt of court by Judge Cook.
Hutton has been taking special in
terest in the proceedings, connected
with the injunction issued by Judge
Cook to Jean Pon, proprietor of a res
taurant at 1129 Dupont street, restrain
ing the police from interfering with his
business. Chief Wittman and Captain
Duke were cited for contempt of court
in violating the injunction by the ar
rest of Jennie Davis, an Inmate of the
house of ill fame in the rear of the
restaurant. She was arrested just after
she*had left the restaurant. It was
shown that although the Chief had
been served with a copy or the injunc
tion and had notified Captain Duke
there was no proof that either of them
ordered the arrest of the woman.
Policeman George F. Barry, who ar
rested the woman, was then cited for
contempt and he was adjudged guilty
and fined $50 last Saturday, the Judge
Intimating that any further violations
of the injunction would be severely
punished. Meantime Barry and Police
man John TV. Davids had arrested Beu
lah Williams after leaving the restau
rant and they were cited for contempt,
the proceedings to be heard to-day.
Attorney Saffold then made the mo
tion for a non-suit, basing his action
orchis claim that the plaintiff had not
shown that she was in a position to
marry at the time she claimed to have
become engaged to Willingham, and
that furthermore the agreement she
is alleged to have signed acted as a
bar to her action. Judge Graham de
nied the motion after taking it under
advisement for an hour, and the trial
of the case was then resumed.
Willingham was the. first witness for
the defense. His testimony reflected
upon Mrs. Richards. At one-partic
ularly harsh statement he made the
plaintiff jumped to her feet and called
him a liar and then sank sobbing into
her chair. The court then adjourned
until this morning at 10 o'clock.
Mrs. Marie Malar and Mrs. Mary C.
Thomas, friends of the plaintiff, were
then placed on the stand. They both
testified that Mrs. Richards had told
them she was engaged to Willingham
and that they had both seen her "in
his company a number of times. Their
testimony closed the case for tho plain
tiff. Â¦ ,yj<i. :-Z r X
FRIEXnS TKSTIFY.
It was at this stage of the proceed
ings that Mrs. Richards broke down
and cried. Saffold asked some rather
personal <iuestions, and the little wo
man took umbrage at them. They
aroused her ire. and she hysterically
denied that the relations between her
and Willingham were anything but
those properly^existlng between an,en
gaged couple. She was further arous
ed when S.iffold stated to the court
that Mrs. Richards had Â¦ signed an
agreement waiving all claims she
might have against the defendant for
the sum of $500, and that after"" Wil
lingham had paid her $300 she had
repudiated it.
Mrs. Richards was placed on the
stand just as soon as court opened.
She was cross-examined in a vigorous
manner by Attorney Saffold, but she.
answered his questions without hesi
tancy. The onlv time she displayed
any doubt was when he questioned her
concerning the man whose # name she
bears. She could tell of their marriage,
but was not certain whether he is dead
or alive; neither was she sure that she
was ever divorced. She said she was
almost certain that she had obtained
a divorce fourteen years ago, the last
time she saw Richards. She said that
at that time she and Richards went
to an attorney's office and arranged
for a divorce, and was told then that
it was all right. After that, she said,
she never bothered her head about the
matter. She felt, she said, that she_
had been divorced and that she was
therefore free to wed again. She also
admitted telling Willingham that she
was a widow, and then, some time
later, telling him that she did not
know whether her husband was living
or dead.
The Richards-Willlngham breach of
promise suit attracted a large audi
ence to Judge Graham's courtroom
yesterday. Though the testimony was
tame and not of the spicy order evi
dently expected, the spectators were
repaid for their expense of energy In
climbing the City Hall stairs and their
long,, open-mouthed vigil by a display
of woman's tears. Mrs. Richards broke
down under cross-examination and
shed enough tears and cried loud
enough to satisfy ev^n the most mor
bid curiosity strick^h spectator in the
courtroom. She regained her self
control, however, after a few moments,
and from then on until close of court
for the afternoon, when sfte again
grew hysterical and called the defend
ant a liar, the proceedings lacked ex
citing features, except, perhaps, dur
ing the argument of a motion for a
non-suit made 'by Willingham's at
torney, when the repeated objections
of H. Digby- Johnston, the plaintiff's
knight errant, to the remarks of coun
sel, caused the / proceedings to take
on an appearance of life. Themotion
was denied by Judge Graham, and
once again was the audience cheated,
for it was expected that if the suit
had been thrown out of court the fair
plaintiff would voice her disappoint
ment in a vigorous fashion.
