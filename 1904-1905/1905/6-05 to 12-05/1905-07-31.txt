Hamlin Garland in
Colorado Prison
Three Hours.
Goes In for Color for a
Story, but Gets More
Than He Wants.
Forgetful Turnkey. Neglects
to Release the Author
When Desired.
Special Dispatch to The CaU.
COLORADO SPRINGS, July SO.â
Locked in a cell in the State peniten
tiary next, to a man condemned to
death, Hamlin Garland, the author, who
was in search of color for a new story,
g-ot more of it than he wanted, for
the turnkey was absent-minded and
<Jariand did not get out for hours from
the cell which he intended to occupy a
few minuies. The condemned man in
tRe next cell cursed volubly and once
yelled to Garland:
"What bloody murder are you in for?
When are they going to stretch your
neck?"
Garland arrived here a few days ago
and secured a letter from the El Paso
County. Sheriff to the Warden of the
penitentiary at Canyon City. Arriving
there yesterday, he had a prison sup
per, heard many "stories of escapes and
\u25a0wild experiences and then decided to
ppend some time in a cell. He was
looked up in a dark one/ After what
teemed an interminable period he was
rel^a^ed by the turnkey, who frankly
admitted that he had forgotten his
voluntary prisoner. Garland was in
tjie cell three hours.
\u25a0 While Garland was in the cell a terÂ»'
rifle explosion occurred, which the
novelist would have sworn shook thÂ«s
foundations of the penitentiary. It was
a thuncerbolt, but Garland .did not
know it until two hours after. There
was a scurrying of guards, whispered
inquiries around guarded windows and
then all was still as death. The stories
that Garls^id had beard two hours be
fore about explosions, narrow escapes
and murders ran riot in the darkness
before his eyes and for two hours he
had a chance to gather much "local
color."
Some time later to his cell came the
night captain. The huge door opened
and Garland was free. The thunderbolt
had not done any damage other than
to disturb the nerves of the writer and
to give him a practical picture which
he will never forget. Garland went
into the mountains last night for more
color. . . .
MILLIONAIRE'S
PROPERTY FOR
STENOGRAPHER
Contest Over Albert
.Johnson's Estate
Is Ended.
Special DUpatch to ThÂ» CalL
MINNEAPOLIS. July SO.â Through the
dismissal of proceedings in the District
Court Miss Edna Dickerson, a Chicago
stenographer, came into undisputed pos
session of the estate of Albert Johnson,
the late Minneapolis millionaire. Upon
stipulation between Asa Johnson, brother
of the deceased, and Miss Dlckerson the
District Court appeal. from the order ad
mitting the will to probate was dismissed
and a judgment affirming the order of
the probate . court was entered. The
special administrators were discharged
and letters issued to Miss Dlckerson as
unprotested executive. .
Miss Dlckerson was the sole legatee
named m the will. Dr. Johnson con
tested the will on the ground that his
brother was of unsound mind and had
been unduly influenced by his Chicago
friend. During a protracted hearing the
contest failed to produce any evidence
of Insanity or undue influence and the
will was ordered admitted to probate.
The contestant appealed and preparations
have been going on for what promised to
be a hard-fought lawsuit.
The cause for the dropping of the case
is not stated in the stipulations and
neither the attorneys nor tfcsir principals
would consent to be interviewed on the
subject.
The estate consists of between 52,000,000
and $3,000,000.

Special Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK, July 30.â Although for
two weeks he steadily denied that he
had ever traveled under an alias or was
married more than twice, Frederick Carl
ton, the alleged Brooklyn Bluebeard, to
day owned that his real name was Me-
Candless with Martinez and Cartier as
aliases, and that he had had four wives.
Inspector Cross 6ays he has had six.
Carlton declares that only one of his
wives is living in New York State at
present and said as the police had been
unable to find her, he felt practically
safe. The woman he admits he married
as Martinez, Is Mrs. Etta Kingey of Gor
don, Ala. Inspector Cross is bending his
energies to find Willetta S. Bird, to
whom Carlton acknowledges he was mar

be In the city now. Carlton has made
an affidavit to an insurance company
that he was married to Elinor Vande

Jury will be asked to Indict Carlton for
bigamy on his own admissions as soon
as the girl is found. Carlton said to
day:
"I went from Fort Barancas to Gordon,
Ala., to get married. I brought the
woman to New York City. When we
parted we were good friends. They are
right about that other marriage, the Bird
girl, f but they haven't been able to find
her. They have me married to a woman

ST. *LOUIS, July.joâ Luthtr Burbahk. the- famous California horticul
turist, declares that the great "object and^aim of his life h to apply to the
training of children those' scienttfic:~i3eas .which he has so successfully
..employed in working miraculous transformations in plant life.
This phase of the great naturalist's character; hitherto kept secret
from the world at large, was revealed in a recent interview with Rev. Dr.
James W. Lee, pastor of St. John's Southern Methodist Church, whp re
turned yesterday from a trip to Santa m>sa, Cal., whither he went for
an interview with Mr. Burbank. / # . ;
Dr. Lee says that Burbank has 2500 Visitors a year, but-he does not
see more than' one-fifth of them. .
"My time is worth $2.50 an hour," M^ri Burbank said to Dr. Lee.
/ The clergyman told Mr. Burbank that he had referred to the latter's
'work in an address at Portland and had expressed the wish that he might
introduce into the method of rearing children some of the scientific ideas
that Mr. Burbank was applying every day to the improvement of plants.
Dr. Lee says that Mr. Burbank's eyes immediately flashed and he replied:
"That is the great object and aim of my life."
Fatal Ignorance in Training Children.
Dr. Lee was astounded<at the unexpected reply. of Mr.'Burbank. as he
had presumed. that the latter was completely 'wrapped up in his studies
of plants. Continuing, however, Mr. Burbank declared that plants, weeds
and trees were responsive to a few influences in their' environment, but^
that children were infinitely more responsive, and the failure to recognize
the fact of the spiritual elements in the environing conditions of chil
dren had been the fatal lack in dealing with them.
Dr. Lee asked Mr. Burbank if he was familiar with the works of
Thomas J. Barnardo of London, who has educated some 60,000 waif chil
dren in. the ninety-three homes which he has founded in various parts of
I England, with the result that only 2 per cent . of them have turned^out
bad. . Mr. Burbank' replied that he had 'studied Barnardo's methods of
rearing children, and that the latter was doing in the realm of human life
what he (Burbank) was doing in' the realm of plant life.
Humanity to Enter Upon New Existence.
"Barnardo," he continued, "has demonstrated that infinitely more
can be done with children than with weeds and plants. AVhenever human
beings recognize these realities in the realms of human life and begin to
apply scientific principles to the Uraining of children, then humanity will
enter upon a new stage of existence."
Mr. Burbank said that, in his opinion, every person should be physi
cally, morally and spiritually perfect, and could be if the same attention
were paid to his or her training that he was giving to weeds. He de
clared that, just as he nad wrought miracles with plants by bringing them
into contact with those elements of their environment to which they
rapidly responded, should those who have the care of children seek to.
do for them arid to train them by bringing their- natures into relation
with all the elements in their environment to which they are potentially
responsive. _ . '
Dr. Lee's interview with Mr. Burbank' lasted only fifteen minutes.;
The Californian presented him with the originil manuscript cf a speech
â¢ which he recently made at the commencement exercises of- the public
- school at San Rafael, Cal. 'He said that this was the only address he had
ever given for children. Dr. Lee pronounces it a .masterly effort and
prizes the document as one of his most valuable possessions.

ANGLO-JAPANESE BONDS
TO BE WELDED STRONGER
Negotiations Are Under Way for Per
fecting a New Alliance.
ITS SCOPE IS TO BE MUCH ENLARGED
Great .Britain Will Give No Advice to

WASHINGTON, July 30. â Keen Inter
est Is leli here in the negotiations,
which, it is understood, are making;
substantial headway between Japan
anil England, looking; to the renewal of
the Anelo-Japanese alliance. The scope
of the alliance, it is known, will con
siderably exceed the present' union,
though to what extent neither Europe
nor Washington haa been able to learn.
The announcement of the main points
of the new alliance noon after the con
clusion of the Washington conference
would not surprise diplomatic circles
here.
Japan comes to the Washington con
ference assured that, whatever her
peace terms, they will have the rsympa
thetic approval of Great Britain. Sev
eral hints from Washington to London
that the cause of peace would be served
by a suggestion to Japan from her ally,
favoring moderation in her demands
upon Russia, have not availed to
change the British Government in its
apparently unalterable determination to
stand by Japan, however severe she
makes her conditions of peace.
Nor has the British Government seen
its way clear to render assistance to
Washington in the efforts which this
Government is making to obtain an
armistice. Advices reaching here -show
that London is opposed to an armistice
until Japan has been satisfied the Rus
sian plenipotentiaries are prepared to
do more than discuss means of ending
the. war. If Russia is ready to conclude
peace and lias' so empowered her pleni
potentiaries Great Britain, it is be
lieved., might favor an armistice, but
even in such event, it is said, she would
be unwilling to offer Japan advice on
the subject.
EXTREME LOYALTY TO JAPAX.
As" understood in Washington, Lord
Lansdowne's position is that, as the loyal
ally of Japan. Great Britain can afford
to -take no step nor assume any attitude
that would in the remotest degree re
dound to the advantage of Japan's
enemy. However much London may
wish peace, for humane reasons, her
loyalty to Japan, whose pledged ally she
is, prevents her even from indirectly
bringing pressure to' bear by suggestions,
advice or otherwise at Tokio regarding
the negotiations, the effect of . which
might serve to moderate Japan's peace
conditions or hasten a truce. When
Japan asks her ally for advice the Lon
don Government, it [is said, is prepared
immediately to give it, but this advice
will be based on Japan's interest as a
primary consideration.
is this attitude on the part of the
London Government misinterpreted in
Washington as indicating that its of
licials do not share In the wish of the
neutral powers for peace. It has been
made plain that the activity of the
President has the full sympathy of the
Britis-h \u25a0 neople, although their first
thought, it is declared, must be ki the
interest of their ally. *
â¢ At the same time, the London Govern
ment, in its exchanges with the Ameri-
XaUi Embassy in London, has not hesi
tated to declare its confidence that Ja
pan's terms will not be unreasonable,
viewed' in the light of the results of the
war. As it was recently expressed by
onÂ«* cognizant of the British attitude,
"London has never, either in the ne
gotiations preceding tne .war or since the
â¢war was begrun, found Tokio assuming
an unreasonable position, Japan has been
exceedingly reasonable throughout this
struggle, and we are not at all appre
hensive that. she will bring to Washing
ton demands that are immoderate or un
reasonable.'" .: '.*
OXE STL'MBLIXG BLOCK.
Believing, as official Washington does,
that Japan will not Insist on the dis
mantlement of Vladivostok, should Rus
sia fail to agree to it in return for the
neutralization of Port Arthur, the ceces
sion lof Saghalleri. which. It is under
stood, will be among the essential con
ditions, will, the officials here believe,
prove the most serious obstacle to peace
in the Far East. Saghalien had not been
captured when the President initiated his
efforts to brlp.g the belligerents together.
The fact that, up to that time. Japan had
not taken a foot of Russian territory,
simplified, in the" opinion of Washington
and Berlin, the problem of bringing about
peace negotiations.
It Is understood to-night, from a source
\u25a0which, although not official, is well in
formed, that Russia will vigorously 'op-'
pose the recession of Saghalien. Whether,
in the evÂ«^nt of Japan's insistence on this
as a condition precedent to peace, Russia
will sielrt is a matter of speculation so
far as the officials here are concerned,
but in quarters friendly to Russia serious
doubts are expressed whether M. de
Witte brings with him the authorization
to yield Russian territory or whether' he
will be willing to ask for euch authority.

of 25 years, foreigners, women, gov-.
ernors and vice governors of provinces,,
prefects and police authorities, nomads,
and persons deprived of civil rights. '\u25a0

eighteen of the larger towns there wiir
Tie a system of electoral colleges num-i
bering 160 members; for St. Petersburg.
Moscow and eighty other towns these
members will be elected by electors of
the first degree, comprising owners of
land and house property exceeding
51300 in value; the electors in the case
of St. Petersburg, Moscow and 1500
other towns to Include also the holders,
of industrial patents 'and paying speci

ask for Mrs. Lund. ; Her husband came
and she drew, repulsively away from him.
Still she cried for Mrs. Lund, whom she.
said would put her right again. A man
went to this woman. When she heard,
that Mrs. .Welch was apparently, insane
and was crying'for her she trembled vio- 1

she withdrew to her room.; Within a few

I barely know her." ,ln these few min

WOMAN IS HELD.
Mrs. Welch was not sent home. She will 1
remain in the hospital until the cause. 6f
her 6trange actions is determined. The
little child is being cared for by tender
nurses and he cops happily to his newly
made friends. The mother lies peacefully
in a clean white cot, unconscious of her
wanderingÃ of mind during the day. Mrs.
Lund is at her -home in San- Bruno,
whence she may be summoned by the
police at any time.
'. And now comes the strange story of
these two women. â. The husband ;pf. Mrs.
Lund died nearly ai'month". ago;
a week after, hfs death. slt% came /and
lived with Mra. .'Welch in' ths little Tionw!
at 240 Sweeney!! street. Until ' thls' ! time*
Mrs. Welch had lived contentedly with
her husband, who *is employed? in thb
city roi'.nd. There was a little baby to
bless their household and a .pretty 1 daugh
ter of" 14 years to help with the . work.
Never was there a finer picture of simple
happiness than when this loving family
.went .strolling in the hills on Sunday
afternoons, as was their wont: All . this
was before the advent of Mrs. Lund.
Shortly after Mrs. Lund left 'this happy
household the sister of Mrs. Welch died.
In her sorrow Mrs. Welch went to see her
newly made friend for consolation, and
it was then that an intimacy,, which the
husband claims is the cause of all yes
terday's trouble, began to grow up bc
vtween them. - , . . . ; V. .
â¢SPIRITUALISM A FACTOR.
Spiritualism, was the outcome. Both
Mrs. Welch and. Mrs. Lund wanted to
talk with the dead, and .they attended
many meetinEs which were led by'inja
tic3. V. hen th^y were together their talk
was constantly of. hypnotism. Mrs. Welch
began to stay. away trom home at nlg'.its.
KJ In the meantime her, husbairltrisd. to

' The scene" between Husband' and" wife
at the hospital , was, a pathetic one. The
heart-broken man had hunted hours for
the woman he loved, *and when ut last
he sought the police-. and they, told him
that- she was in the hospital his heart
leaped for joy, as he hurried to her aide.
Imagine the feelings of this man when
she .turned away from, him and held the
child of them both far out of his reach.
With loving words he sought to right
her mfnd and cause her to return to him,
but she only shrunk tho farther.. He
dared not attempt to caress her. All the
time she said that her real friend was
coming to help her. .
With tears In his eyes Welch left his
.wife in the care ' of the white-aproned
nurses. He could do nothing for her and
he went back to his saddened home. Wife
and babe were gone, but the daughter,
a bright girl, the child of his wife by
her first husband, was there to cook the
evening meal for father.
Then it '.was that some one was sent to
see Mrs. Lund and find out If she would
not come to the hospital and bring the
unfortunate woman to her senses. When
she heard that Mrs. Welch was apparent
ly suffering from Insanity or . from a
hypnotic influence she trembled con
vulsively. 3 She would not go to see the
woman and quickly hurried to a room
alone. '.- /: \u25a0 ; .- ' . \u25a0â¢ ... â¢\u25a0. -
Now came the mysterious circum
stance. Within a few minutes after Mrs.
I.und had retired "to the privacy of. her.
own room but in Sari Bruno Mrs. Welch,
miles away-in.; the Emergency. Hospital,
straightened up quietly, a perfectly sane
woman. "Where is my husband?" she
asked,. "l want to go, home to my fam
ily." She knew nothing of her wander
ing and refused to talk of Mrs. Lund.. .
It was a strange reaction. A moment
before she had, ; cried for this -woman of
alleged * myeticlsm, and in her period of;
sanity she- said that she scarcely, knew
her. A moment before . and the nurses
tore the child from her for. fear that she
would kill it, while- she fought blindly
to keep it:; sane, she did not know that
the baby was thftr<v, . .. '
Mrs. Lurid declares that she cast "no
spell over Mrs. .Welch.' She admits that
they were friends : and that they often
talked of .spiritualism, but she insists
that she exerted no Influence over her.
Mrs. > Lurid is employed "in a cannery i at
Tenth and Bryant: streets, and gave for
an extreme nervousness she does not
have the appearance of a mystic; Welch
says that unless she remains away from
his wife in the' future he will swear j out
a complaint for her arrest.; In .the mean
time Mrs. Welch will bekept in the hos
pital until the ; soundness' of her '"mind Is
fully established l^ .

SLAVERY UPON

School Superintendent Says
Traffic in White Children

Special Dl3patch toTha Call.
I ST. LOUIS. July 30.â Slavery within the
dominion of the United States, white per
sons sold arid. held in bondage despite all
the ; laws of. clvliization. this is the
charge, of Professor W. -A. 4 Davis, .su
perintendent of public schools at Un
alaska, Alaska.. In a letter the professor
tells how he has been at work since 1593,'
when he went .to Alaska', to eradicate
the evil, but he has been unable to get
the United States authorities interested.
He says he has personally freed two
little girls. from slavery and sent them
to their homes, while he has worked with
out avail to procure the release of six
Other white girls in Unalaska. He says
children are sold in other towns. In
part the professor writes:
"At the beginning of school in Sep
tember, 1903, I canvassed the village of
Unalaska for scholars and to my sorrow
and disgust I found eight little girls,
ranging In age from six to twelve years,
ir slavery. When I asked .their masters
if they intended to send them toschool
they . seemed ~* much surprised and grew
quite indignant arid In substance said.
'Send, them to school? We did not. get
them to send. to school. We got them to
wait' on our families and that's what they
are going to do.' , . '.
"Immediately 'upon making this dl 3.
ccvery I called the attention of the proper,
authorities to the facts, and was told'
that. immediate steps would be taken to
remedy the evil. Up to the present. time
nothing has been done officially, though
by Individual effort I have obtained the
release of two pitiful little creatures who
were returned to the island whence they
came, . and : all, in all probability, were
sent .agahv at. lthie first opportunity in
some other direction. .
"ThÂ«se children . are . usually orphans'
and are given away by those with whom
they have been left by their dead parents
as freely and with as little compunction
as one. ln the States- gives away puppies
of an inferior breed of dogs. They are

STEEET KALLWAY USES
THE GEATITY SYSTEM
Raised Stations Supply Pow
er on a Chicago Elevated
Line.
8sÂ«e!al Dispatch to TIM CIU.
CHICAGO. July. 30â As an addition to
its electric power the South Side Ele
vated Railway will use the gravity sys
tem to assist In starting and stopping .
Its trains when Its new third track and.
Englewood extension are completed.
While this announcement has not beÂ£n
made by the officials of the company, a
railroad engineer, who has watched the
construction of the line, saja It la built
on the "inclined plane" plan, with each
station at the summit of a hill.
While much power will bÂ» saved by
the news system, the object .of the
scheme is not so much economy as U
is to produce speed in starting and
stopping trains. The incline will bo
sufficiently great, it la said, to ptart a
train without the use of electric power.
It \u25a0is said that 'the Chicago gravity
elevated system Is the first to be in
stalled In the world, although steam
railroads have for yeara employed the
system In freight yards, where cars
are switched without, other motive
power. The fall from the summit of
one of the stations to the lowÂ«r point
of the Incline is about three feet. The
new track at the stations is about thir
ty-six Inches above the old one. Engi
neers say that this fall in a distance of
two blocks will produce a great amount
of "gravity power." Although the track
is built on the "bump-the-bumps" prin
.ciple.-the fall is not great enough to.
be perceptible to the occupants of the
coaches. The power will be utilized
Without Inconvenience to patrons of the

AND INJURES ITS OCCUPANTS
Chauffeur and Woman
Wedged Under
â¢ Machine.
MANY EONES ARE BROKEN
Mrs. Sol Camp, Mrs. An
nie Baron and Driver
. â¢ in the Wreck, .
TWO GO TO THE HOSPITAL
" An automobile accident which result
ed in serious injuries to t two persons
and in the miraculous escape of a third
occurred yesterday afternoon in the vi
cinity x>t Nineteenth avenue and H
street.
Mrs.. Sol Camp of Goldfteld, as a con
sequence of the overturning of the ma
.chine, lies at her 5 temporary apart
ments in the Corona. 7"7 Geary street,
with a broken rib and innumerable
contusions and bruises on the fare and
scalp-. She also suffered a d<*ep cut
over the lip and her body; fa bruised all
, over. Chauffeur Karl Berlin moans on
his bed at U4 Fulton street, \vith a
fractured rib ar.d internal injuries of a
severe nature.
How the three escaped with their
lives is a marvel in view of the 2200
weight automobile's turning two com
f jjlote somersaults and falling the second
time on Berlin, with Mrs. Camp forced
parti.'- through the cover, htr head cut
with ito broken and flying glass.
â¢ Mrs. Baron, the well-known ladies'
tailor on Powcl! street, fared better,
thoujrh severely bruised and shaken up.
"The ladies started for a ridt hi the
park, Mrs. Camp taking- the seat next
to th* chauffeur. When near the ocean
drive Mrs. Camp asked and \yas aj
lowed to drive and for five miles proved j
lierself competent to steer the machine
.with safety. When approaching. a part
of Nineteenth avenue- where there is !
a deep grr^de Berlin told the lady that j
he had better take charge at that point
and he had hardly donÂ«- so when, as the
descent wes being- made the wiieeis
skidded and control of the auto was
lost. " The. machine- whirled around
twice, then twice turned a complete
somersault, the second time coming
down with a fearful crash. Berlin was
threwn under Mrs. Camp and her head
was badly ble^dinjf trom the glass
which became embedded in the scalp.
MRS. BAKO.V AMAZED."
Mrs. Baron, amazed at her own es
cape, hastened to extricate her friend
from ber perilous, position, while Ber
lin, beneath the machine, was' strug
i,'iiru? In agony to reach for the main
valvt . whu-u ho succeeded in closing up
i.nd consequently extinguishing tht flre.
Through his presence of mind and
Â»::<\u25a0Â« r uetermination an explosion of the
gasoline tank was everted.
CiiarKs iiugiu-s of Chicago and Al
:.!ey<-r,c driving in auto 4J>J, hastened
to t ho rescue of the injured and. plac
ing them ::t their machine. hurried
them to the Park Kniergrency Hospital.
vv-htrÂ«- they were- attended by *Dra.
tfafcnaja and stone.
W'lnl<; lying in intense pain and be
tween his groaning, awaiting surgical
treatment, lie-rlln cried, "I am to blame;
no one else. 1 am to blame for it all.
1 wish they would give me something
and let me die."
He- then inquired as to whether Mrs.
Camp was fatally injured, saying that
he would sooner die than that cither of
the ladies should suffer pain.
In the- meantime Mrs. .tJaron called up
ber husband, W. Baron, and Mr. Camp,
both of whom arrived at the hospital.
Berlin said:
"1 jjave Mrs. Canjp the machine at the
park when we were in tJie direction or
the boulevard and we turned toward
Ingrledde. She steered for about live
miles. I should say. We then turnea
and made a circuit trip. At Nineteenth
avenue, near H street, I sugg-estc-d to
take- the machine-, as there the hill is
steep. I did so, and no sooner had I as
sumed direction of the auto than the
wheels began to skid and we were
twirled around twice; then came two
somersaults. I found myself beneath
the machine and immediately thought
of the danger which must follow an ex
plosion under such circumstances and I
struggled to reach the main valve,
which I puecec-ded in closing 1 up. I then
forced myself from under the machine.
That we are all alive is nothing less
than a miracle."
MRS. CAMP RESCUED.
Mrs. Baroti said sTie did not know
where sbÂ« sot her strength, but she
surprised herself by lifting Mrs. Camp
bodily from her perilous position to a
pla< c of safety. Mrs. Baron's white
waist was stained with the blood of her
Â»rviend.
It was Mrs. Baron's second trip in an
auto, the llrst having been taken on
Saturday. In drawing a comparison be
tween the chauffeurs of her first and
second trips she was inclined to think
that Berlin was not an experienced
driver. Berlin says he has had two
years' experience and has been with tiie
White Company, from whom the ma
chine was hired, for two years.
The automobile was much damaged,
three of the wheels and the cover being
completely smashed.

Key. J. G. Kjwlihs of Georgia
Found Guilty of Haying
Been a Party to Murder
VALDOSTA, Ga., July 30.â Rev. J. G.
Rawlins early to-day was found guilty
of .being a" party to the murder of two
children of ,Rev.- and Mrs. W. L. Carter,
and unless a higher court intervenes
Rawlins and his sons, Milton and Jesse,
and Alf Moore, a negro, will have to
hang. The Rawlins boys and Moore
were found guilty of murder some time
ago.
Both Rawlins and Carter ' were for
years ministers in the Methodist church.
A feud started and Rawlins plotted to
wipe out the Carter family. It was ar
ranged that Moore and . Milton, Jesse
and Leonafd Rawlins should go to the
Carter, home and kill the parents while
they sat at the supper table. When the
children ran out they 'were to be. shot
down. The assassins, .however, arrived
after the evening meal. and could not
shoot through the'windows at their Vic
tims., Some noise caused Willie and
Fannie Bell Carter to. run into the yard.
Instantly the murderers fired and the
girl fell dead. The boy. shot through
the body, dragged himself into the
house and told who had done the firing.
He died soon after.
All nlgHt long Rev. and Mrs. Carter
crouched in their home. Through crev
ices in. the log house the Carters could
see the assassins creeping about the
yard, but whether their daughter was
dead or not they could not learn. Final
ly Rev. Carter reached his rifle and fired
through a crack in the door. â¢ The shot
caused the -murderers to flee. Moore
confessed' the plot.

Are Now Its Supporters
Special Dispatch tv Tho Call.
WILLOWS, July 10.â A meeting that
muns much for mc progress of thÂ« Sac
ramento Valley and especially Glenn anu
Colusa counties was held at Maxwell
yesterday. The land-holders within the
confines of the Central irrigation district
met with the new owners of the Central
canal and irrigation district and discussed
the completion of the main ditch of the
.canal and the supplying of plans to the
farmeis of. western Glenn and Colusa
counties with water for irrigation. The
meeting was largely attended by repre
senative land-owners of the district. To
begin â¢ work the company wanted 10,000
acres pledged to receive water when the
canal was completed. The representatives
of Colusa County pledged SWO acres and
there is more than this number offered
in Glenn County. Some of those present
agretd to buy water rights for every acre
owned by them in the district.
It was in the neighborhood of Maxwell
that, work on the old canal was stopped
fifteen years ago. When some of those
who thtn blocked the completion of the
ditch by legaf technicalities arose in yes
terday's meeting and pledged their entire
holdings, the assemblage broke into
cheers.
William Bogan, general manager of the
company, was present and addressed the
meeting. So confident was he that the
liberal terms offered by the company
would be accepted that he engaged be
forehand three steam shovels that will
soon be delivered along the canal route.
He stated that the land-owners were as
much ' interested in the completion of
the work as the canal owners. Three
crer/s will work at different points. The
steam shovels will *be worked nisrht and
day. They will remove 12.000 cubic yards
of earth every twenty-four hours.
The intake will be three miles farther
north than the one originally proposed.
There wi!! be three miles pt ditch to be
completed to connect the new Intake with
the completed portion of the canal. This
will be finished in ,three months. The
work on the new Intake will be retarded,
as condemnation proceedings will have
to be instituted against the owners of the
Kraft Tract in the northern part of Glenn
County. The !and is assessed at 110 an
acre, and the company wishes a right of
way over lÂ«50 acres. Sixty thousand dol
lars was asked for this right. ThÂ« com
pany refused and offered to arbitrate the
matter, but this was refused by the own
ers of the land. The mapping of the piece
of land in question is now being carried
on with the intention of taking the mat
ter to the courts for settlement.
One of the most difficult engineering
feats to be- done will be the construction
of a crossing - for the canal through the
waters of Stony Creek, a stream of living
water, which assumes Immense propor
tions during the flooded season. The es
timate for Ihis is $25,000. which is small
in comparison to the i6O.<XXK which the
original builders planned to spend on the
same work. â¢ \ .

POLICE RAID
YACHT CLUB
Arrest Fifty Members for
Wagering Stage Money
on Phantom Horses
COUKT IS INDULGENT
Sentences the Ringleaders
to Return to the Club
house and "Draw. Corks"
Special Dispatch to Tb* CÂ»n.
BATSWATER. N. V.. July JO.-Paat
Commodore John Dohse of ths Bays
water Yacht Club cheered up a week of
gloom by giving a racing party at tha
yacht club house last night that was a
startling success.
Samuel Graham and .Frank Griffla,
bookmakers, were ringleaders with tha
past commodore. They took their racing
sheets and their stools and a bundla oÂ£
stage money as big as a clothes basket.
After parceling the stage, money they
began to sing the dulcet song of tha.
merry gambolier. 'The club members
took to it. Most of them knew the ropes
and plungeu gloriously as the phantom
horses pranced about the phantom post.
Fortunes were won and lost every min
ute and the stage money was showing
signs of giving out.
Suddenly the door opened with a crash,
and in rushed six policemen, in uniform.
"You are all pinched. If a man moves,
he will be put in irons," shouted tha
leader of the cops.
The merry guests of the past commo
dore gasped and looked to him for an
explanation. But he seemed as aghaat
as they.
"Is this a joke?" he demanded of the
police. :\u25a0 "/ \u25a0\u25a0
"Nary a joke; you are alf pinched. surÂ«
enough. Some one Just tipped oft! tha
captain and he ordered a raid on tha
house."
Dolefully fifty yacht club members
followed the police to the police station.
There, providentially, they were met by
Judge E. J. Healy. who knew them all.
and who consented to hear their cases
at once, so that they would not have to
spend the night in jail.
One by one they were brought before
the Judge. In vain did they protest that
it was stage money they had been play
ing the phantom races with. Judga
Healy regarded each sternly. He lec
tured them on the sins of gambling and.
overcome by the magnitude of the raid,
he said he would suspend sentence. All
escaped save the past commodore and tha
two bookmakers.
"As a penalty for scaring fifty mem
bers of the Bayswater Yacht Club, tha
three prisoners are sentenced to lead tha
fifty back to the clubhouse and draw
cork 3." was the sentence.
"Ha. ha. ha." yelled the crowd, but it
was not until many corks had been
drawn that they realized how they had
been fooled.

Past Grand President Samuel Haskins,
Grand Vice President Charles Wllley,
Grand Secretary George A. Stanley,
Grand Organist Henry C. Costa and Past

Father E. P. Dempsey, pastor of the
church. The sermon was preached by
Rev. Father Morrison, who told briefly
of the great growth of the Institute in
the last few years and commended the
activity of Its members "for their work

helu this evening for the members of
the Institute at the Church of the Im
maculate Conception, under the direction

The ritual exemplified to-day is a com
posite of two which were presented for

FREE DOCTORS
FOR SCHOOLS
Berkeley's Educational Au
thorities Provide Them to
Vaccinate Poor Pupils
BERKELEY, July 30.â Despite the ad
vice of District Attorney J. J. Allen, who
Informed the school directors of Berkeley
that the. law would not permit. them to
pay a physician's fee for vaccinating the
children of indigent parents, .the Board
of Education of Berkeley has decided to
offer free vaccination "to the poor and
to settle the. bills of physicians who do
the work.
This action was decided upon at a
special meeting of , the Board of Educa
tion held last night. Town Attorney H.
H. Johnson, now off on his bridal tour,
had informed the board in a lor g written
opinion that he believed the law justified
the school teachers in paying physicians
for vaccinating the children of poor par
ents in Berkeley. This" legal advice was
contrary to that received last year from
the District Attorney, ami it determined
the Board of /Education, to act accord
ingly. The ' District Attorney, had said
the board could pay only the \ expense
incurred in providing vaccine virus for
the .use" bf doctors' who vaccinated the
children of the poor. .;
Dr/George: lieinhardt, health officer, of
Berkeley, who 'had been asked by the
school board to "recommend three phy
sicians who would do the vaccination
worklfor. the school-board for a, nominal
sum, recommended that Dr. M. M. Bow
ley!; Dr. J. J. Benton and Dr. David
Hadden bff : tequested to assume the duties
of "official vacclna tors to the poor" and
the school board adopted his suggestion.
The three ; doctors were chosen in part
because they reside in different districts
of Berkeley, and; so. all parts of the town
will be equally well served by them.
Tho school board will pay $1 for each
child vaccinated by these three doctors.
Eefofe the operation is performed gratia
the child must bring a certificate signed
by parents or guardians, testifying that
the parents . are ', indegent and unable to
meet the ordinary charge for the service.

FIGHTS DEATH
FOR JUSTICE
Dr. J. H. Callen Trying to
Save Thomas W. Cook so He
May Identify Assailants
OAKLAND, July 30.-Dr. J. H. Callen
is making a stern fight against death in
the case of Thomas W. Cook, the young
grocer who was so "brutally beaten by
thugs a week ago last night. The doc
tor is exerting every effort and bringing
to bear every resource of medical and
surgical science to maintain, life in the
patient in the hop* that he may. be able
to positively identify his assailants.
But the injuryrupon thevheadis such
that it has paralyzed the power of speech.
The patient is in convulsions much of
the time, and but one lucid interval has
occurred in eight days;' Then it jwas not
expected. Dr. Callen seized j the oppor
tunity to mention names to him. The
doctor could onljr remember two of the
names, and he says that when these
were mentioned the young man struggled
to speak, but could not do so. Those
names were Blaker and Schneider. Cook
giving affirmative signs when they* were
mentioned. \ .
Whether death will win and, the police
be left to fight out a case or circum
stantial evidence, or whether Dr. Callen
will. win and Cook be able to identify his
assailants, is a question that will have
to be determined this week. ; for either
Cook will die before another seven days
have gone or 'â¢ he will reach the point
where he can tell who murderously at
tacked him. ' ..
Meanwhile Sheriff, Barnet is holding
the four young suspects. He has dis
covered nothing. that would connect Pem
broke and Crowhurst with the crime, out
is holding, thf m to see if Cook will not
recover, long enough to' say. who was the
third man that attacked him.. The
Sheriff believes | that he-has . enough evi
dence to warrant a charge against Blaker
and Schneider. Concerning the v case
Sheriff Barnet said to T day:
: "I have been sorting : over a mass of
stenographic notes that have been 'taken
during many interviews this week with
the prisoners aild: othors" interested in
this case. After, a . chreful revise of- the
evidence I : feel satisfied there .Is; ample
evidence against, Blaker and Schneider.
Unless something turn's up I. do hot "see
that we have a" case against either Cfow r
hiirst or Pembroke. ; We shall wait . a
few days before moving further as to
prosecution^ in the hope that Cook may
recover sufficiently to tell his story."

' ALAMEDA, July 30.â Marie Reiner,
aged .. nine years, and a member of the
Sunday school class of the First Meth
odist Episcopal Church, was taken into
custody to-day by Detective G. H. Brown
and Policeman Louts Schroeder on sus
picion of having purloined a number. of
hatpins, ribbons and money from head
gear and wraps in the cloakroom of the
house of worship.
The arrest was made at the instance
of Dr. J. Emmet Clark, a member of tha
Flr6t Methodist Episcopal Church, who
telephoned to the police station that he
had observed the child searching among
ladles' hats and cloaks and suspected
that she was . the person who might be
responsible . for numerous petty thefts
that have been committed in the house
of worship recently.
When little Marie was searched at the
City Prison nothing was found on" her
person that would tend to incriminate
her and she denied having stolen any hat
pins, ribbons or cash. . She said that she
knew, of other girls who had done so arid
an investigation ",: will -be I made by the
authorities to. determine whether there
is any.: truth in her story.

WILSON GIVEN
A FREE REIN
President Has Full Confi
dence in His Ability to
Clear Out His Department
OYSTER BAY. July 30.â Secretary Wil
son of the Department of Agriculture is
expected at Sagamore Hill to-morrow.
His .visit will enable" him and the Presi
dent to discus^ the situation in the de
partment as it relates to the investiga
tions now in progress. All rumors of the
intention of Secretary. Wilson to resign
from the Cabinet may be put aside as
merely conjectural. The Secretary has
no present intention of leaving the Cab
inet and the President knows of no rea
son why he should resign.
The President; it may be said, reposes
implicit* confidence in Secretary Wilson
and is thoroughly satisfied that he will
solve the difficulties now presented to the
entire satisfaction, of the chief executive
and of the country. .
It is probable Secretary Wilson would
have come to Oyster Bay before this had
it not been for the unsettled condition of
his department, which rendered it prac
tically impossible for him to leave Wash
ington. . He is pressing every phase of
the investigations now in progress and
will develop every fact which the coun
try ought to know. That the President
is confident the Secretary will purge the
Department of any scandal that may at
tach to it is evidenced. by the fact that
he has "not interfered with the pending
investigations. All matters brought to
his attention have been turned over to
Secretary Wilson with instructions to in
quire into them.. This the Secretary has
done. and. his work has the approval ot
the President. . .. .
It is the determination of both the
President and Secretary Wilson to clear
the Department â¢of Agriculture of every
form of "graft." :
To this end the likelihood is that every
bureau of the department will be in
quired into 'carefully with, a view to as
certaining whether any such condition
exists as , was developed" in the Bureau
of Statistics: but .eftectivejy.
Secretary , Wilson has been working to
this end for many .months. Many em
ployes \u0084 of the* department have been
dropped from the rolls, practically with
out the knowledge of the general public.
Some have been dismissed outright, while
others have been permitted -to resign.
Assurances are given that no stone will
be left unturned to' eliminate every taint
of scandal in the Department of Agri
culture. - â¢_ \u0084.

OAK PAEK ON MARKET
The Rapidity of Sales Shows
That East Side Property
Is Regarded With Favor
OAKLAND. July 30.â The opening of
new tracts of land continues In all direc
tions around Oakland, and the rapidity
with which these tracts arÂ© sold off
shows the demand for residence lots on
this side of the bay. / These.tracts. tracts that
are being offered in' subdivisions arÂ» of
all kinds, and the lots range In prica
from $100 in some sections to magnificent
private park sites in acre sizes to meet
the demands of the most fastidious.
The investor can find his own price,
and. his own terms, whether it be al5 a
month payment that Is like putting his
money in the savings bank arid depend
ing upon the increase in land values to
pay him interest, or whether it be a
large cash payment that would give the
purchaser immediate title. The fact that
these tracts .are sold offyilmost as soon
as they are offered to the public goes td
show- an unbounded confidence in the
future of real estate upon this sldÂ© of
the bay, and it shows further that people
with money to invest are putting what
they have into land.
There ha 3 been such a development
around Oakland In the last few years;
street car lines have been and are being
built in so many directions ; new ferry
systems aro being established and pro
jected: new overland railroads are build
ing into this city as;to cause investors
to find that they can turn their money
over easily, and that big interest is made
by simply purchasing property and
holding.

There are times when life
seems a burden â when you are
tired, worn-out, have dull pains
in the head and a continual
feeling of uneasiness. \u25a0 You
have no appetite, and your di-
gestion is poor: your sleep
broken, and you get no rest;
Little annoyances seem great
mountains of 'trouble, andyotJ
are blue, melancholy and given
over to gloomy forebodings.
This means low vitality â ex^
hausted brain nerves.
For this condition Dr. Miles'
Restorative Nervine is a spe-
cific ; it is a.food for the nerves.
It builds up the nervous sys-
tem, and restores lost energy.
Try it to-day and see if your
sleep is not sound and refresh-
ing, and the morrow brighter
and more hopeful.- ;

BUT RETAIN PENNANT.
Seals Slug Harder
Than Tigers at
Right Time.
Big Crowd of Fans
Roots for Home
Team.
The first half of the baseball season
of eisoo was ushered out yesterday
with the Tacoma Tigers leading the
Seals by half a game. It was a great
finish, and had the Seals taken just ono
more contest they would reign as
champions. Yesterday's double victory
brought them within striking distance
of the Tigers, but that one game
loomed up as big as a mountain in their
path toward the pennant.
Even though the" race was already
decided an immense throng was on
hand to see the tinal contest. It was a
ball grarre full of goodness and bad
ness, luck and misfortune. The Seals
had all the former, while the Tigers
managed to corral the latter in large
and juicy chunks. The final score was
7 to 4, though the result surely would
have been different if a hit had came
through for Tacoma in the last in
ning.
The game wended itself along for
two hours and ten minutes. Roy Hitt
was wilder and more erratic than ever,
but he got away with some brilliant
plays and luck never deserted him.
The Seals clouted the ball for fair
when hits were needed and in this way
managed to plug along and get away
with the game.
San Francisco could not get on the
tags till the fourth, when with two
stowed away Mohler doubled over' third
tnd Hildebrand singled to right and
stole. Brown purposely walked Irwin,
bat Nealon did just as well; slapping a
single out to left and bringing two in.
In the seventh Brown was a target for
nearly overy man who takes money
from Uncle Hank. They slammed and
walloped that ball to every remote cor
ner of the lot and chased four runs in
on five hits.
Truck Eagan's double scored Nor
dyke in the sixth, which was the first
one for the Tigers. During the eighth
thc-y began to show remote signs of
life once more and hammered Hitt for
t-Tiothcr pair. With two out in the
ninth nobody could make good, so the
gamo rame to an c-nd when a hit or so
might have turned the tables.
Tht most sensational incident of the
contest happened in the third
when tho bases wore filled md but one
down. Hitt had pitched himself into a
hole, but he got out of it to a spectacu
lar manner by winging both Nordyke
and &.gan out on strikes.-
Tlip Sohls and the Tigers leave this
evening for Taeoma, where they will
inaugurate the second half of the sea
feon. Oakland and Portland will open
up here, while Los Angeles, goes to
SejUle to engage- the Siwashes. - The

i PORTLAND, Or.. July SO.â Hall's Sl
washes have succeeded in taking five
[of six games played with the Giants
-on the home grounds. To-day \u25a0 Mc
c'reedie's men took thÂ»: morning game,
but the visitors had it all their own
way in the afternoon in the final con
test of the season.
Poor playing before a big Sunday
afternoon crowd was responsible for
the defeat of the Giants. Corbett
helped throw the game away by several
bad tosses in fielding bunts. Shields
had the opposing baxsmeri under his
thumb, except when McLean's two
bagger brought home Van Buren in the
sixth. Garvin's wing was in good
shape in the morning and the Siwashes
could not solve his delivery.
The ex-fireman was wild and tUe four
runs made in the second, third and
fourth were too much of a nan Heap *o
be overcome. The Portland team leavt-s

ALL BUSINESS PROSPECTS BRIGHT."
â¢pÂ« XCELLENT crop prospects, heavy earnings of the great iiidus-
M trial corporations, with increased dividends in a number of
-*â ' quarters, continue to produce a corresponding optimism: m
commercial circles. Confidence in. another good year is freely ex
pressed and no discordant note is heard anywhere. The best of it :s
that these confident expectations are not accompanied by any specu
lative activity, for as a matter of fact speculation is dull and has been
for several months. The cheerful conditions" seem purely legitimate.
General conditions hinge almost exclusively on the crop pros
pects, as the condition of' the money market is not much of a factor
at present, owing to the plethora of funds all over the world. The esti
mates of the cotton crop have been reduced of late, owing to decreased
acreage and wet and otherwise unfavorable weather over the belt, and
the latest figures now indicate a crop of possibly not over 10,000,000
bales. The outbreak of yellow fever in the leading gulf section may
also have a damaging effect on the cotton industry later on,' and
these factors are producing higher quotations for cotton, with a ner
vous and sensitive market.
The leading crop in importance now is corn, which, with an in
creased acreage of 2,000,000, and no weather damage up to date,
promises a record-breaking yield. This is a very bullish condition,
as it not only presages activity in general distributive trade and in
creased circulation in the great corn belt, but large gains in railroad
earnings and consequent liberal dividends to stockholders in the
Western lines. As compared with corn and cotton the wheat crop
occupies a subordinate position, but this crop, too, will undoubtedly
turn out satisfactory to the country and put further revenues into the
pockets of the railroad shareholders.
These encouraging crop prospects extend a stimulating influence
on the national stock market at New York and upon the money mar
ket as well. Supplementary thereto is the bright outlook in the iron
and steel industries. A prominent Chicago steel operator last week
made the sanguine statement that the steel corporation is confronted
with the largest business in its history during the next twelve months,
and that a net income of $.200,000,000 is even now assured. The de
mand for steel rails has lately shown a decided improvement, and
manufacturers are no longer extending concessions to buyers to effect
sales, while the demand for structural materials and building require
ments has also developed increased activity, with orders booked well
into the future. - - *\u25a0;
Another encouraging feature, according to late reports from New-
York, is the excellent condition of the dry goods trade. The dry
goods jobbers throughout the country, almost without exception, re
port that during the first half of this year their business has shown
marked improvement, both in volume and profits, over the corre
sponding months of 1904, with an increased fall trade in prospect, and
it is noteworthy that the best reports in this line come from the great
corn belt, owing to the fine prospects of that cereal. Many other im
portant lines also report business during the first half of the year
better than last year, hence the feeling of confidence manifest all over
the country seems warranted by the facts. The hide and leather mar
kets are very firm, with activity reported from almost all. sections.
Wool continues high and in brisk demand, and provisions alone are
rather quiet than otherwise.
The bank clearings of the country continue about as for the past
several months, every week showing a material gain over the cor
responding period last year. The gain last week was 21.6 per cent,
with Cincinnati and Indianapolis the only two cities of the first' fifty
on the list showing a loss, while the aggregate clearings were $2,244,
525,000. The gain at San Francisco was 35.8 per cent, while Los An
geles ran up to 71 per cent, Spokane to 42.7 per cent, Seattle to 84.6
per cent and Portland to 37.7 per cent. These figures show the cur
rent activity of trade on the Pacific Coast. The failures for the week
throughout the country were 214, against 220 last year â another good
sign.
It will thus be seen that all lines of trade â financial, agricultural,
manufacturing and merchandising â are making a bright exhibit, with
confidence pervading all quarters. Prosperity is still with the Ameri
can people. It is to be hoped that they, will not abuse it nor inflate
it too far. ri/{.r i/{. ': : W-': : 1' : " : '
TO MAKE CANAL WORKERS HAPPY.
WELFARE experts are the latest addition to the force that is
to dig the Panama canal for us. The title that names. the
office of these two men now on the way to the isthmus to
stimulate and keep alive that merriment of heart which "doeth .good
like a medicine" among the young men sent so far from home to
labor in a sickly climate is a most attractive and impressive one. We
hope they will fulfill their office of "welfare experts" so thoroughly
that the title and the office it names will survive in American institu
tions and phraseology. These experts were detailed for the duty by
the Civic Federation and are now on the way to the canal zone with
Chief Engineer Stevens and Chairman Shonts. Their job is to keep
the colony of Americans at work in that semi-pestilent and lonesome
land in good health and vigorously joyful.
To recall a little bit of recent canal history is to see the wisdom
of this move. About a month' ago. there was a report that the steam
ers returning from the canal zone, were bringing back to their homes
equally as many workers as they had taken out. It was a good busi
ness for transportation companies, but a bad one for. Uncle Sam.
The men to expedite the canal work and invited there by the
bosses came, saw, but instead of conquering went back home in dis
content. They were homesick, for one thing,' and subjected to the
enervation of a hot and unaccustomed climate ; they found in
ferior board; no amusements whatever; and, worst of all, a general
condition of things which made them doubt whether the authorities
had the welfare of the workers at heart or in their thought at all.
Now that bugbear is to be eliminated from the hardships that will
test the toughness and manhood of the corps of workers in their la
borious exile. Whatever measure, of the discontent may have been
due to real neglect and oversight, and whatever to imagination, the
sentence remains true that "there is nothing good orill but thinking
makes it so," therefore the mere presence of the welfare experts and
the thought of the kindly -intent of their efforts will tend to dispel
much of the gloom. /
Some of the things to be arranged to induce content are tennis
courts and baseball grounds. In the words of Mr. Shonts, they are
to have "amusements, healthy games and outdoor exercise." They
are also to have reading-rooms and other indoor entertainments. In
fact, the programme is quite extensive and almost enticing. We
wonder if the welfare experts may not carry it so far that the canal
zone will get to be a winter resort and pleasure-seeking Americans
go down there to watch the dirt fly. The' republic of Panama is to aid
this enterprise of contentment with a subsidized theater, and as there
will be special theater trains, every worker in the Culebra cut can
readily attend the play.

IF you wobble a bit In the long, hard
race,
.A3 even the best may do;
If you are not a winner or even a
"place"â
And that Is my standing, tooâ
Why, still It is better ahead to go.
Short as to breath and painfully slow,
Than to buck at the quarter or half, you
know,
And to stand with the useless crew.
If you're playing the game and are minus
a trump,
While the other chap's got them all;
If the fortune awaited has come with a
slump ,
Of a species your soul to appeal,
Why, still it is better your hand to play.
Though it's mainly composed, of a deuce
and a trey,
Than to whine of your "luck" and com
plainingly say:
"Â£ won't play the cards as they fall."
I'm recalling a time when a horse had a
fall.
And a slower horse won in his place;
And the man who played cards that were"
painfully small .
At last found the trumps in their place..
So trot In the race, or the big game play.
With a right good heart, nor know dis
may.

AN INTERVIEW WITH NICHOLAS.
{<IT seem>a Htt!e hard," said the Czar,
1 as he nonchalantly dodged a bomb
which, had been thrown through the
windowâ "lt seems a little hard that a
man cannot have a little friendly con
versation with his own cousin without
the whole world being agitated to know
what was said." - r . -' ''
The reporter who had obtained the
coveted interview sighed with -the mighty
ruler. W-':?\
"And yet," Nicholas continuedâ "By the
way, will you kindly step on the fuse of
that hand grenade that is hissing in the
corner? Thanks. And yet n . as I was
saying when Interrupted, I realize _, that
we accidental great ones of the earth
must pay the price of our greatness.
Yes, I realizeâ do not be startled; It was
only a bullet, but if you will sit in the
corner you will be somewhat safer un
less there is a subterranean explosion.
You will observe that, l do not sit In a
line with the windows." Believe me, this
Is solely because of my regard for ray
dear people, who could ill afford to lose
me."
The Czar again paused to sigh and
drink a glass of wine after the official
taster had sampled it. He then con
tinued the interview:
"Realizing this penalty of greatness, as
I have said, my well beloved cousin Wil
liam and myself have determined to give
out an official statement of exactly what
was said in the course of our world
mystifying conversation. Is your pencil
sharp?" '-"','\u25a0Â£-'
"It is. sire."

saidâ be sure to take this down cor

"I said: 'I will take the same. "What

"His low-spoken response was 'Eln

â¢"This Is all. Now.you may go."
"Pardon me. sire. I do not wish to
Imply a doubt, for I feel^none: but was

"Nothing whatever. ,We were about to

THE LUCK OF MR. SHORTT
"Yon Just won it."
VIRTUE is frequently its own re
ward^but it Is not the only thing
that gets rewarded in this topsy
turvy world of ours. Note the wicked
experience of William Shortt. whose
dear wife and precious child are far,
far away, enjoying an outing and leav
ing the fond husband and father to his
own devices for the first time in his
married life.
Billy has anywhere from 30 to 300
friends who have been waiting for just
such a chance to show him what Is
going on in the heart of a great city.
His most commendable devotion to' his
family had kept them from gratifying
that desire until his temporary wid
owerhood, then they emerged in
droves from the bushes in which they
had been concealed and declared them
selves.
It had been the policy of Mr. and
Mrs. Shortt to put by something every
week for a rainy day somewhere in the
dim and aging future. Mrs. Shortt'.-*
final injunctions on her departure were
to the effect that the absence of her
self and the baby ought to enable, Billy
to make the weekly deposit in the sav
ings bank as. large or larger than
usual, and he readily agreed, not hav
ing in mind the friends lying in am
bush." And she not only wrote him
dally to much ,the same effect, but she
insisted upon direct answers to her
questions after every pay day.
The first week Billy was a little less
than $10 shy. He* was about to con
fide that unfortunate fact to Mrs.
Shortt in his daily letter, when the of 7
flee boy informed him "dat Flyaway
was a sure ting and it come straight."
A dollar or two didn't seem to make
much difference even if it were lost,
Â£O the boy got the dollar ho asked for.
And v was a 12 to 1 shot, and Fly
away won hands down. So Billy had to
rewrite the first page of his letter and
did it with a conscience relieved and
$2 to the good. '; *\i

Impatiently resenting the interruptions

a moment: sit quietly down; get calm,

Ask yourself honest questions. Does it
pay to let yourself "fly all to pieces"
because an Inopportune caller kept you
from your work; because the dressmaker
faile<J in the fit of your new, gown, and
the milliner put the wrong combination
of colors into your hat?

The next week he entered 6for the
first time the 60-cent pool they had In
the office each week. He hadn't dared
count his cash before pay day for fear
he would Be short for tne following
week. But he had a pretty vivid idea
that there was a gaping deficit. At
last it could no longer be avoided and
it was time to deposit and report to
headquarters. Much to his dismay he
learned that two bills which he fondly
supposed were for 55 each when he
felt them in hispocket were for $1 and
Si' respectively, leaving him $7 to the
bad. And he was straightening them
out on" his desk and pulling them a
little to see If they wouldn't increase
a little in size when one of the fellows
came /.up and deposited JS in 50-cent
pieces on his de.sk. .
"What's that for?" asked Billy.
"It's the pool â you just won it," and
went a%yay grumbling something about
a beginner's luck.' So. the weekly au
diting came out Satisfactorily. ,
I Billy, went a little stronger than usual
the third week. He had .\>. You can't
go on accepting favors and entertain
ments of forty ornfty intimate personal
friends without \u25a0 giving them something
in return. Unfortunately he met his
wife's sister in the restaurant after the
theater one night and, being more shy
than ever before, con..ded his fix to her.
She promptly wrote about it to Mrs.
Shortâ no man would ever think of doing
a^thing like thatâ and he had a scorch-
Ing letter to read just at the psychologi
cal moment when he had made an in
ventory of his cash and learned he was
$14 71 behind on account of that uesk's
doings. ?v- i!- : - : 'â¢
. The letter was one of .those perfectly
calm and matter of fact statements
which wives are so good at making,
something to the effect that h*er entire
future and that of their child with all
Billy's prospects of Independence re
rcsed in/- that weekly deposit, and she
eupposed that the life insurance would
have to go next. Then there was noth
ing in the dim and threatening distance
looming but, a fine assortment of poor
houses and half \u0084or whole orphan asy
lums. And she loved him and shÂ» had
always supposed until now that he loved
her, but he no longer cared for the dear
little baby either. Â»
Billy knew he wasn't any lamb, but. he
decided he could be a little sheepier than
ever with words like that jangling in his
brain, and he went downstairs to get
something to take the taste of the cor
respondence out of his mouth. It has
been observed before that he had friends.
Well, they began coming in as If some
body had sent a hurry call through the
neighborhood. And they thought be
tween them that shaking dice would be
a pleasant way of celebrating the aus-,
picious meeting.
After the shaking was all over. Billy
went over and deposited the missing
$14 71 and made- it an even $20. Then,
more In. sorrow than in anger, he replied
to that letter, inclosing the bank book
as proof of his probity and unflinching
rectitude, and Insinuated, his ink mixed
with tears, that it was hard on a lonely*
man, deprived of the society of his near
est and dearest, to have to have his little
remaining happiness taken from him by
accusations the most unjust.
Just how it's going to.com* out this
week Billy isn't sure; but he has been
receiving daily apologies from the seat of
former war.
Laterâ like all deceiversâ Billy has
come to grief. His luck has deserted^
him, and he will never be able tc explain
the bank deposit" deficit. * ' .'

cursing luck?
As the day wears on why do you
prove yourself a still more reckless
spendthrift by storming around and
swearing: when this and that plan goes
wrong and people make unexpected de
mands upon your time?
Of course you think your business
deals and schemes are the most im
portant-affairs on earth. To you they
undoubtedly are. They mean your
bread 'and butterâ perhaps houses and
diamonds .and automobiles.' But don't
exaggerate the Value of these things.
The thing you really want is power
over yourself. Some day you will
know it if you don't know It now.
Strange how short-sighted we hu
man beings areâ how we emphasize the
significance of the nonessentials .and
minimize the value at th* really neces
sary possessions!
There is too great striving after
things and too little after the attain
ment of character qualities that would
serve us for all Ime. Control is a pos
session without which no one can live
a well-balanced, happy, useful life.
And yet thinjc of the things we imag
ined to be more important!
We count the day lost that does not
register *ame definite accomplishment,
some "practical" work performed., or'
some financial advantage gained. 1 No
matter If tempers h^ve been lost and
precious energy wasted In mad striv

these things we congratulate* ourselves'
upon a day well spent. t
Nothing could be further from the
t ruth.' The day Is j far from well spent ,
that ias known exhibitions of teriiper,
impatience, hatefulness in the famdly

( When we- dejvelop fine qualities of'
character, when we.' learn patience,
sweetness, gentleness, poise, we are
gaining possessions that wiMoutllve in
usefulness any, and all of the material
things. for which we struggle.
So what of the annoyance, the dis

NEED CLEANING
W. A. Gates Declares Moral
Keform Is Necessary for the
Preservation of Country
OEGANIZATION NEEDED
People of the Nation Must
Band Together in the
Cause of Righteousness
W. A. Gates, secretary of the State
Board of Charities and Corrections,
&*>oke last night at the l-'ourth Congre
gational Church, taking for his subject.
"Needed Moral Reforms." He spoke at
length on the much needed improvement
of conditions in the great cities to keep
the country from being stunted in its
growth and to keep it $rom retrograding.
Mr. Gates said in part:
"Our cities must be purified. I mean
purTTied in every way. Purified against
c corrupt ballot box, and purified in the
social walks of life.
"If we expect to build up a great na
tion, and a nation that is to last for time
to come, we have got to take steps
against the evils and the corruptions
that are encroaching upon us. To do
this we must organize and must form
what might be called an organization of
righteoussess. This is positively neces
sary for the preservation of our country.
"We must get out and work and band
together In this cause. It took thou
eands of years to build Rome and bring
it up to greatness and grandeur, and only
a few years to bring about its dissolu
tion and decay. The very thing that con
fronted Rome, when that city was in the
zenith of its power, is liable to confront
any of our big cities of this country. To
free ourselves from the possibility of
such is the problem of the day. Wa
must uee every endeavor to gain a com
plete reform in the management, ruling,
and government of our cities.
"Crime is largely rampant in our coun
try. The public example has a great
deal to do with producing criminals. And
what is this largely due to? To the lax
ity of some of our laws. I do not be
lieve in children laboring, and I think
there should be child labor laws enacted.
If, however, the child will not go to
school, or has not the means to allow
him to go to school, then by all means
let him go to work- Never let a child he
Idle, for idleness begets crime.
"Saloons are one of the great evils of
our big cities. They flourish here in an
amazing degree. I understand there are
over 3'XK) saloons in the city of San Fran
cisco. I think a saloon is tha highway to
crime. Saloons add to crime and to the
cost of running the country. I do not
mean to say that drinking thould be
stopped. This is an impossibility, but I
<1o cay that the number of the saloons
chould be grreatly lessened.
'"The management of all the affairs of
this country rests In the hands of the
vople. It is for the people to say what
The future of- the country shall be. It is
lor them to go out and begin this reform
tnd the first and greatest step for them
to take is the reformation of our pres
ent corrupt ballot box."

E ULROAD MEN BEGIN
CONFERENCE TO-DAY
Representatives From All
the Harriman Lines WiH
Take Part.
Representatives of all the Harriman
lines doing business directly with the
Â£an Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt LaJke
road are to take part in the conference
which begins here to-day between the of
ficials of the Salt Laka road and the
Southern Pacific Company. It was
learned yesterday that tho trouble over
the refusal of the Southern Pacific Com
pany to permit the Bait Lake road to en-
Joy an interchange of trafSc with it en
<rc.ua! terms in Southern California will
not be the only matter that will tome
before the conference.
The presence In this city at this par
ticular time of Traffic Manager T. M.
Schumacher of tne Oregon Short Line
gave rise to much speculation ameng
railroad men until last evening, when it
was discovered that J. A. Munroe,
freight traffic manager of ihe Union Pa
. ciflc Company, was also here and it was
learned that he had also come to par
ticipate In the conference.
The Oregon Short Line, which has many
Interests In common with tho Salt Lake
road, by reason of the fact that the for
mer advanced rolling stock to tho new
road tr.diis In direct connection with the
Clark lino, has sent its traffic representa
tive here to take up certain matters with
the Salt Laka road officials pertaining to
tho contracts exlstnlg between them,
and Munroe will sit at the conference as
a sort of advisory factor in tbo Interest
of tho Union Pacifia
So far as the troubles regarding the in
terchange of traffic aro concerned. It was
learned yesterday that all questions on
this subject taken up at the conference
will bo decided by tho respect! vo legal
representatives of tho Southern Pacific
and the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt
Lake roads.
It is claimed by the Salt Lake officials
that the traffic agreement signed by the
representatives of both roads, when the
Bait Lake line was opened for business,
was supposed to be equitable for both
Interests, but that certain ambiguously
constructed provisions in the contract
relative to Interchange of traffic, which
some suspect that Traffic Director Btubbs
of the Harriman lines was responsible
for, have raised all the row. It Is theae
questions that will have to receive the
attention of the lawyers of the . two
reads. Peter F. Dunne will represent
the Hariiman interests and T. E. Gib
bon will attend the conference on behalf
of the Salt Lake road. Among the oth
ers who will take part in the conferenco

PATTY THRILLS
ORPHEUM CROWD
Cavorts. .About Merrily r 6n
His Head and Does Many
Clever Inverted Stunts
OTHER NEW NUMBEKS
Morton as Silly and Funny
as Ever, and Madame Bobe
Pleases With Xylophone
Paris sends two novelties to the Orph
eum this week, Alexander Patty, who
walKs on his head, and - Mmc. 1 * Celina
Bobe, who play a the xylophone sinfully
veil. These, with J. J. Morton, who
could not. hail from anywhere but Amer
icaâ"did you say America?"â "l said
America, Susan"â if he tried, with two
and a half excellent holdovers, make up
a bill of the best.
Alexander Patty furnishes the thrills.
Patty is peculiar. He wears his feet
where most of us wear our heads, and
iÂ£ ho ever i^uuires the Services of the
gentleman on Sutter street, who "re
moved corns from all the crowned heads
of Europe," it will bo for his cranium.
There are two of them, two Pattys.
They begin with some of the Quickest,
deftest tumbling and head to head bal
ancing ever seen at the Orpheum. Then
Alexander steps up on his hair to the
other head, dines and wines, Juggles,
plays a violin duet with the right side
up Patty, and with hardly. a blush upon
his youthful cheek descends. Afterward
he "walks" several feet upon a raised
platform and clumps down the staircase
on his curls. It is not at all beautiful,
but if one were cast upon a desert isl
and without one's arms and legs it would
be good to remember. ,
J. J. Morton Is as classically silly
as ever. If any one^ else were to tell
the Morton stories he would be used
to clean up with for : the next turn.
But then he couldn't. When Morton
tells about the time when he was a
"legitimate," they -"traveled with their
own river"; howvthe: child and the dog;
sat by the river and the child fell in;
how the dog drank the river and saved
the child; but how the villain came
along, and how he went for the child;
then how the noble ; dog "coughed up
the river and the billows rolled over
the villain â period," you laugh. You
laugh and hoggishly want to stop your
neighbor's hysterics for fear you may
lose one silly, gorgeous word of . the
thing. To hear Morton tell about hir
ing a horse, how the livery .stable man
"woke one up" and the rest, disperses
any further sobriety. â¢\u25a0'. -
â¢ Mme. Cellna Bobe furnishes the musio
and the shoulders of the bill. Mme.
Bobe'B xylophone playing would be won
derful If it were not for her shoulders.
She is, in fact, a Paderewskl of; the
xylophone, as one discovered in listening
between times. She set a Mascagni-like
pace for the "William Tell" overture that
bothered the orchestra, and generally
gave a brilliant and astonishing perform
ance. If xylophone playing is at all
worth while, it is surely to be heard at
its best here. Mme. Bobe is further a
fairly accomplished violinist, but her
shoulders are virtuoso, and her gown,
that timidly approaches them, is a chef
d-ocuvre.
New also, are Smith and Campbell, who
for reasons unknown call . themselves
"The Men of Quality." Their! act'con
sists largely in an uninteresting display
t of^bad manners, with a good patter song
tjnd others needless. The-Messenger Boy
Trio was presented with a handsome
floral arrangement last night by the Cali
fornia Special Messenger Service mem-,
bers to much applause.: Then Estellita
continues her charming dance, the Wilton
acrobats grow in favor, and S. Miller
Kent continues.

ZIONIST FIRM
FOR PALESTINE
Great Britain's Offer of a
Tract iv Africa for a
Jewish Colony Declined
VOTE A DECISIVE ONE
Socialist Section ; Leaves
the Conference When the
Conclusion Is Reached
BASLE, Switzerland, July 30. â By an
overwhelming majority the Zionist Con
gress this afternoon decided not to ac
cept the offer of Great Britain of a
tract of land in East Africa for the
formation of a Zionist colony..
A special sitting of the congress was
called for 9 o'clock last evening for the
discussion of this subject. Four orators
supported and four opposed the accept
ance of Great Britain's proposition.
Tho debate lasted for over six hours
and President Nordeau eventually sus
pended the sitting, owing to the tumult
ous scene 3. The sitting was resumed
at noon to-day, when the committee hav
ing the matter in hand presented the
following resolution:
"That the- Zionist Congress firmly
maintains the principle for the foun
dation of the colony in the Jewish
fatherland/ Palestine, or in that vicin
ity. The congress thanks Great Britain
for her offer of African territory, the
consideration of which, however, is ter
minated, and hopes that Great Britain
will continue to aid in the solution of
the Jewish question."
The resolution was adopted by a
large majority, amid loud protests from
the Socialist section, the members of
which left the hall. The sitting was
concluded with enthusiastic cheering.
A second session of the congress was
held to-night, calm prevailing throughout.
President Nordeau requested Mr. Green
burg to convey the thanks of the Zion
ists to the British Government for its
East African offer.
Mr.; Leon, in the name of the American
delegates, proposed a vote of gratitude
to the memory of John Hay, who often
gave assistance to the Jewish people.
The new statutes of the Zionists will
come up for discussion at the next
Zlonlstlc Memorial Service.
Memorial service in all parts of the
world was held yesterday in commem
oration of ' the departed Dr. Theo
dore who was held dear by
every Jew. The present being the first
anniversary a large congregation as
sembled in the Russ-street synagogue
last night. The service opened with
prayer by Rabbi H. Samuelson, af tar
which a short address was delivered by
Dr. Epsteen, who spoke on the helpers
of Zion. Leon Album spoke on the
prophetio tongue of the late Theodore
Herzle and. his views on the Hebrew
race. Congressman Julius Kahn made
an eloquent address on the happy con
dition of the Jews in the United States.
He hoped and trusted that the- young
rising generation would prove as loyal
and true to this Government as "their
fathers in the past.

ASSAULT ON WIFE
LEADS TO A FIGHT
Thomas Ryan Injured in
an Affray on Harrison
Street.
A free-for-all fight was started early
â¢last evening at Langton and Harrison
streets by Thomas Ryan making an
assault upon his wife. Several other men
came to the woman's assistance and be
fore the police had quelled the disturb
ance some of them' were badly battered.
Ryan emerged from the scrimmage with
a fractured skull, while Thomas Koran,
a bystander, lost his teeth by a blow.
Mrs. Ryan's face was badly bruised.
John Littzens, one of the participants,
was locked up at the- Southern Station
and charged with battery. '
Ryan, who was formerly an ambulance
driver at the Almshouse, lives with his
wife at 1123 Langton street. The couple
had been quarreling. Ryan lost his
temper and struck his wife. Several per
sons came to the woman's assistance and
instantly there was a free-for-all fight.
When Policeman Phillips arrived the
crowd dispersed and many of the partici
pants made their escape. Ryan had been
knocked to the ground and jumped on.
The policeman gathered up as many as
"possible and Ryan was removed' to the
Central Emergency Hospital. Dr. Kudch
examined the injured man and found that
he had suffered a fracture of the skull.
He was also bruised about the body.
While being treated Ryan- tried to escape
from . the hospital attendants. He suc
ceeded in running as far as Eighth, and
Market streets 'â¢ before he was overtaken
by a policeman. ; It is not known who
injured Ryan. Littzen and Moran reside

Secretary. Shaw - has issued .an order
authorizing officers - and others In the
customs service' who are required to
wear uniform, to wear, during the sum
mer months, from June 1 to September
15, a straw or suft felt hat of suitable
style, to be determined by the collector
at each port, the style to be the same
for all; at the port.
It is apparent from the Secretary's or
der, that he has not been dissuaded from
carrying into effect the . instructions is
sued early iii the year requiring certain
clatses Â»of employes -to wear red caps
when on duty. While the red caps. have
not yet been received at this port, they
are expected shortly. Several ; of
local politicians have been in Washington
lately trying to convince Mr. Shaw that
some color other than J red I will ' be more
agreeable to the . customs force. .
To all callers the Secretary ! has said
that he sees no feasonfe^ modifying his
original order. Mr. Shaw concludes his
latest order as follows: r'. 'All uniformed
employes must be provided with- the reg

TALKS LIK E HIS FATHER
Boys Are Urged to Keep in
Good . Bodily Health and
to Improve Themselves
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OYSTER BAY, July 30.-Seven boys of
Oyster Bay are members of a Sunday
school . class taugrht by Theodore Roose
velt Jr. To-day was Its second Sunday.
All of the other boys wished they were
in it. The seven boys who belong: to It
get to church an. hour before Sunday
school opens. . - \u25a0 -
5 Theodore Roosevelt J.r., not yet out of
hlsj teens, has much of the earnestness
and vigor of his father, and he has en
tered Sunday school work with the en
ergy his father shows in his larcer office.
The Roosevelts have been members of
Christ Episcopal Church at Oyster Bay
for years.
When youns Theodore, with his Bible
under his arm, walked briskly up the
gravel path to the Sunday school this
morning a cluster of clean-faced young
sters, grouped about the door, exclaimed,*
"There's Mr. Roosevelt." and hurried in
side. Theodore Jr. escorted his cousin.
Miss Christia Roosevelt, who teaches an
other class, and they were chatting gayly
as they approached the church.
TheNUass that Theodore Roosevelt Jr.
teaches is a bright, healthy lot of youns
sters. After the opening exercises Koose
velt first asked them how they ali felt,
and they promptly responded:
"Pretty well, thank you."
"That's good," said the teacher, earn
estly. "Boys ought to' be in very good
health. They, must take care of them
selves."
"Yes, sir." they assented.
Then the President's son opened his
Bible, turning to the fifth chapter of
Kings 11. He read very slowly the story
of how Naaman was cured of leprosy by
Elisha by dipping himself seven times In
the river Jordan. After this the Presi
dent's son had a flfteen-mlnute chat with
the youngsters. ' %

PAPER nOTTLEV A D VISED
FOR MILK CONTAINERS
Fever Bacteria Found in Them and
They Are Xiot to Be
. Refilled.
The many disadvantages of. the glass
milk bottle, as now almost universally
employed, are well, known. One oc. the
most serious, is .the difficulty. In securing
proper cleansing before it is refilled, with
the accompanying possibility of spread
ing Infection. Efforts to secure improve
ment in this detail of milk service have
heretofore been unsuccessful, mainly be
cause of failure to obtain a satisfactory
substitute.
Recent investigations by Dr. A. H.
Stewart of ' the bacteriologic department,
Philadelphia Bureau of Health. Indicate
that at last an acceptable container* has
been found in what he designates as a
single-service paper milk bottle. It Is
made of heavy spruce wood fibre paper,
conic in shape to facilitate nesting, and
with, an ingenious locking device -to re
tain the bottom.
An important feature of the bottle is
its saturation with parafln by being drop
ped in that substance at 212 degrees
Fahrenheit and then baked. This steril
izes the bottle and prevents the milk
coming in contact with the paper Itself
and adhering, as it does to the glass bot
tle. For shipment the bottles, are packed
In nests of twenty, three nests being
sealed In a sterile bag. the lids are also
put up in sterile packages.
Bacteriologic tests with sample bottles
were exceedingly satisfactory. As re
ceived from th 2 manufactory, none was
found to contain micro-organisms. Closed
bottles were s'.nt to several dairies near
Philadelphia, a glass bottle being filled
with the=Â«ame lot of milk. When re
ceived at the bureau the glass bottles in
variably showed slight leakage around
the caps; the paper bottles did not." -.
In every instance tho milk In the paper
bottle contained fewer bacteria than did
that in the glass bottle, the average be
ing a fourth as many as in the latter.
Certified milk in the paper bottles kept
sweet two days longer than that in the
glass bottlfs. If these paper containers
give such results in general use the de
livery of, milk in cities bids fair to be
revolutionized. They are. light, tightly
sealed, perfectly 'clean- and sterile, and
are to be used but once, thus doing away
with all bottle-washing In private houses
and milk depots. '
Their "cost is such thnt they may be
used without increasing the price of milk
to the. consumer.' -The subject is one that
should at once.be thoroughly investigated
to, determine if everyday itsc . confirms
these laboratory findings, i If it. does" a
great advance has been made.âWashing

Limited PotÂ» rr of tbe President.
A dispatch from Rome states that Sen
ator Bacon of Georgia was received In
private audience last Wednesday by tha
King of Italy, who in the course of the
conversation remarked that a President
of the United States has more power than
a Kins of Italy. Probably the Georgia
statesman Improved the opportunity and
described to the Italian monarch the sys
tem of government in this republic. The
powers of a- president, as defined and
limited by the constitution, are not such
as to constitute a menace to our institu
tions. The President cannot declare war.
That is the privilege of Congress. He
cannot levy internal taxes or duties on
imports. The taxing power is vested In
Congress. He cannot appropriate the
revenues of the Government, for Con
gress along can authorize expenditures.
He cannot enter into treaties without the
approval of the Senate. These are checks
upon the chief magistrate which strip
him of anything like absolute power.â

Report That Williams Will

Is Said to Be Misleading
RUMOR OF BLACKLIST
California Turf Magnate
Takes Down Barrier to
Guarantee Him Entries
Special Difratch to The Call.
CHICAGO. July CO.- A report that the
California Jockey Club will not
away horses wlvch race at Highland
i'&rk. Fort Erie and certain other
tracks, sent out from Buffalo last week,
i.i said to be a little misleading accord
ing to an official of th*Â» Western Jorkey
Club. This official Fays It has been
agreed that President Williams may ac
cept entries in California from many oi
those who have raced en the American
Turf Association tiacks in order that he
may be sure of securing enough horses
for the San Francisco nport.
But not all horses will be permitted
In the far West. Williams is in posses
sion of a special black list, ,the names on
which are not made public. In this way
the Western Jockey dub evidently plans
to get even with- certain leading turfmen
on the side of the enemy, and in order
to di"oid possible legal complications no
official action of this kind has gone on
the books.

FLOWER GIRL
A FAST HOUND
Little Courser Outruns the
Fleet Panoche in Close
Contest at Union Park
Flower Girl was the speediest hound
in the running at Union Coursing Park
yesterday afternoon and in. a long test
\u25a0luring the final round of the big special
stake she managed to outrun the. fleet
Panoche and win by a score of 6-4. The
latter hound was a 2 to 1 favorite in the
betting and the victory of the Flower
Girl came like a solar plexus punch to
the wise ones. The stake was a fast on<Â»
all the "way through, each of the trials
being full of snappy coursing ana
clever turns by the dogs. â¢:
Blaze got away with the reserve
stake, shutting out Forest Fire in the
last round without a point. Marvic
Clair took on a burerbf r speed in the de
ciding course of the class reserve stake
and beat Tralee's BeSt out by one little
point. ; The hares were Vvery lively, lead
ing the dogs all over the field and, on
this account, there were an .unusually

ORT WELLES TUBS FAyORITE.
Banner Meet In History of i.Snrntog'a
Track Opens To-Day.
NEW YORK, July .SO.â The Saratoga
midsummer meeting of. 1905 will be in
augurated to-morrow' jcrith' thÂ« running
of the best mile and a quarter handicap
of the season: it will bo by' far the best
race seen In these parts. ..Wherever the
turf folk gathered to-day they discussed,
the card for to-morrow. All concede that
it is a fit programme from, end to. end to
inaugurate what promises to-be the best
meeting in' Saratoga's racing history-
While all the best judges of .form arid
of prices believe that Ort Welles should
and will be. favorite for the. big handicap
to-morrow, it is conceded that the. race
is a tough one. The great King Eric,' the
colt who twice showed at Brigton that
he has regained his" splendid form of last
season, first when he whipped : Beldame,
in the mile and again wh'eri he took place
money in the blg f handicap. . close at the!
heels of Artful, has done some fast work
here. Enoch Wishard has given him his
preparation and the mile and ; quarter
was turned in 2:10. â¢ Beldame's chances)
it is believed, "were enhanced \ by to-.

Freeport, the fast ison of Fetter Free,
showed his heels to some of the- fleetest
greyhounds of the State yesterday at
Ingleside Coursing . Park and defeated
Friendless Boy for final honors in the
champion stake by a score of 5-2. The
blue dog showed a remarkable turn of
speed and worked, the. game cleverly.
Galveston, in the deciding course of the
reserve stake, raised the flag over Im
perious, which ran an improved dog.
-T. Jolly's Princess Savoy finally round
ed to form and, captured the long end
of the class event ; from clever Mlsa Brum
mel. Pocatelli was put out in the second
round by Fdxhunter, after the. former
showed the way to the hare. The bet
ting throughout the Gay was the heaviest
witnessed in this park for many months
and the dogs ran fairly well to form.

HANDICAP FAILS
TO STOP THEM
Baker and Durilap Carry Off
First Honors in Doubles
Tourney oh \ Park Courts
The handicap doubles tournament
commenced on the Golden Gate Park
tennis courts last Sunday was com
pleted yesterday. The winners turned
up in George Baker and Charles Dun
lap, one of the three most heavily han
dicapped teams. It was the' first of a
series of tournaments for tha new
three-time cups, and the names of Ba
ker and Dunlap will be the first in
scribed on them.
The three matches played yesterday
were not as close and exciting as was
expected. All were won in straight
sets and were too one-sided to be inter
esting. The handicaps.were not as well
adjusted as usual, which probably .ac
counts for the easy victory of the win
ners. The other teams will undoubtedly
receive large handicaps in the ne"xt
competition of the kind.
The final match was .between Baker
and Dunlap (owe 15 3-6) and A. H. Bra
bant and Harold Gabriel (owe 2-6) and
was the closest of the three played.
Brabant did not perform as well as
.usual and his opponents were not slow
to find It out. They played most of the
balls to him and Gabriel had little
chance to shine. On the other-hand the
losers foundDunlap to be. more uncer
tain than Baker and the .ormer bore the
brunt.. \u25a0 : :/-':' /:^:\: \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0:\u25a0\u25a0 :\u25a0\u25a0-\u25a0':\u25a0< : - rK;'^ \ ]: - '\u25a0'-. '\u25a0
The first set Baker and Dunlap won
easily, their opponents setting only one
game. In the second set Gabriel and
Brabant improved considerably and led
throughout . the first part. The score
stood 4-1 in their favor and at 5-5 they
had a lead of 40-0, but lost the same.
Baker and Dunlap took this set, 7-5.
. The third- set was also close, but Ba
ker and Dunlap had it won all the way.
The winners were steadier than their
opponents and made fewer errors. Ba
ker was the star of the four. The score
was 6-1, 7-6. 6-4. . \u25a0\u0084 .7 Â± 'â¢% 1
Of the two semi-final matches, the one
between Baker and Dunlap and George
Janes and Herbert Long was much the
closer. The teams met on even termb
and -Baker and Dunlap won by a scoriÂ»
of ' 6-2," S-6. Long and Janes are not
playing the game as well as they did a
few months ago or the match would
have been closer. They made a good
showing in the second set, but their op
ponents were too steady for them. Dun
lap was in fine form and gave his clever
partner excellent support. V ...
The other semi-final match. was be
tween Harry Rolf e and Clarence Griffin
(owe 15) and Gabriel and Brabant (owe
3-6). It* was a one-sided affair and the
outcome was never in doubt. Brabant
and Gabriel won, 6-4, 6-1. The losers
did not put up anything, like the gamw
they j played on the previous Sunday,
when they beat Whitney and Foley. Ga
briel's fast forehand drive won his team
many aces. Rolfe and Griffin were both
off in their net work.
The veteran TV. B. Collier made his
reappearance on the California Club
courts yesterday after an absence ox
several months. He showed a, lack of
practice, but,' with Chaster. Smith for a
partner, proved Btrong enough to beat
George Whlpple and Frank Stringham
in a close match. Smith was also a tri
fle rusty. The score in favor of Collie:
and Smith was 13-11, 4-6, 6-4. Collier's
monologue was a3 much .In evidence as
ever, and caused the usual amusement
among the spectators. . * â¢..-. â¢â¢\u25a0-.-_ ;.

FIRST DOUBLE
EAGLE SHOOT
Norddeiitscher Schuetzen
Club and Verein Marksmen
Fire at Bird With Success
J. DIECKEN MADE KING
Vice. President's Fair Young
Daughte? Crowns Him With
Honors After Best Score
For the first time In the history of coast
shooting, the Norddeutscher Schuetzen
Club and Verein members yesterday used
the double eagle for a target with great
success. Mounted upon a high pole at
the right of the ranges, the huge wooden
bird presented an admirable mark for
the sharpshooters. The reason that the
double eagle differed from the usual
shoots of this kind was that it had two
crowns on the heads and a single large
crown surmounting both."
.Chief of all the prizes, the king, was
won by J. Diecken. The shot that
knocked the heart of the bird was fired
at 6:35, but it was the intention of the
members to continue the shoot another
Sunday if the king prize was not decided
yesterday. The sun's rays did not fall
upon the target during the afternoon,
which made the shooting exceedingly dif
ficult. Each of the successful marksmen
was greeted loudly after winging a piece
of the ponderous target. '
The event of the day was the crowning
of King- Dlecken. After the prizes had
been distributed. Miss Francis Ipsen.
daughter of the Norddeutscher Schuetzen
Club's vice president, placed the laurels
on his head and a handsome medal was
also presented- to him. ... Â«
From 10 a. m. until 6:33 p. m. the sharp
shooters fired at the eagle before all the
parts were dissected. The target was
made by Adolph Stoll and was so con
structed that when a- bullet from one of
the rifles hit a marked joint,' down would
fall a part of the ' bird. Thousands of
shots were fired by the sixty-two marks
men who took part in the contest.
The winners of the prizes were as fol
lows:
Kin? prize. J. Dlecken; center crown. B. V.
Rathjena: right crown. Otto Schinkel: left
crown, John Peters: apple, George H. Bahrs:
scepter. H. P. Peterson; right ring. John
Lankenau; left ring* William C. Morken: right

PORTLAND, July 30.â Ralph Rose, thÂ«
giant shot-putter of the Chicago Athletic.
Association, arrived here with the Chi
cago team this evening. ! The big athr,
lete, who has received' much criticism -
because of his â¢ refusal to compete for
the Olympic Club of San Francisco, Is
said to have decided on new alma mater.
According to the report. Rose, who found
life at Ann Arbor distasteful, will be
found at Yale when college opens lit
September. This statement follows close"
on the heels of Rose's declaration that
he would not attend college again and 1Â»
the result of a three days' conference
with two Yale men. During the long
trip from Chicago these representatives
of the Eastern college were very at
tentive to the big athlete. -:-yÂ»>: : ;
Rose admitted that he was urged to
attend Yale and he felt favorably dls- 4
posed, toward taking such steps. If Rose
should go to Yale he would count ten
points for the blue In the hammer and
shot events. Inasmuch as he has been
away from Michigan for a year, he will
be eligible to compete in the Eastern .
inter-collegiate meet next year. â¢ .â¢â¢ '
The addition of Roae to Yale's sonacj.
would In a large measure offset the loss
of Trainer Mike Murphy. The various
