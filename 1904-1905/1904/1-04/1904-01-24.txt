Â¦The new, multiple colored photographs are strikingly beautiful in point of
desigu and boldness. Tliey are a combination of the most daring poster ef
fects with the most delicate photographs obtainable, and though there are an unlim
ited number of variations, the most popular multiple pictures are those wherein on
the face and figure are photographic, while allelse in the picture, such as head or
nameiits, necklace, ribbons, laces, flowers and the whole bewildering array of femi
nine frou frou generally is worked out in an elaborate and dashing color scheme
as for instance the picture of Mrs. Squires reproduced herewith-the face is brought
out in bold relief against a deep rich bank of roses.

"Yes; but she is not very well. She
has been ill a Ions while," she added,
but she did not tell him that Judith
had been nursing at Tampa, and that
she had been sent home, stricken with
fever. '
The doctor had been counting his
pulse,- and now, with a grave look,
pulled a thermometer from his pocket;
but Crittenden waved him away,
, "Not yet, doctor: not yet," he said,
and stopped a moment to control his
voice before he went on.
"I know what's, the -matter better
than you do. I'm going to have the
fever again; but I've got something to
do before "I go to bed, or I'll never get

herself, she thought of the night 'of
their parting and the warm color came
to her cheeks. He had never sent her
a line, of course. The matter' would
never be mentionedâ it couldn't be. It
struck her while she was listening to
the coming of the feet on the turf that
they, were much swifter than her
father's steady-going old buggy horse.
The click was different; and when the
buggy. Instead of turning toward the
stable, came, straight for the stiles, her
heart' quickened and she raised her
head. She. heard acutely the creak of
the springs as some one stepped to the
ground, and then, without waiting to
tie his horse, stepped slowly over the
stiles. Unconsciously she rose to her
feet., not' knowing what to thinkâto
V do.' And; then she saw that the man
wore a slouch hat, . that his coat was
off, and that a' huge pistol was buckled
around him, and then she turned for
'the door, in alarm.

The* voice was weak, and she did not
know it: hut in a moment the light
from the lamp In the hallway fell upon
\a bare-headed, gaunt-featured man In
the uniform of a common soldier.
â¢ "Judith!"
This time the voice broke a little, and
for a moment Judith stood speechless
stillâ unable to believe that the wreck
, before her was Crittenden. His face and
eyes were on flreâ the flre of feverâ she
could not know that; and he was trem
bling and looked hardly able to stand.
"I've come, Judith," he said. "I
haven't known what to do, and I've
come to tell youâ toâ ask "
He was searching her" face anxiously,
and he stopped suddenly and passed
one. hand over his eyes, as though he
were trying to recall something. The
I girl had . drawn . nerself slowly upward
until the honeysuckle above her head
touched her hair, and her face, that had
been so full of aching pity for him that
"Yes, dear," she said, gently; and she
put one hand on his forehead and the
other on the hand that was clinched
on his breast. Slowly his hand loos
ened and clasoed hers tight, and Crit
tenden passed, by and by, into sleep.
The doctor looked at him closely.
He had just made the rounds of the
tents oTi'Eide, and he was marveling.
There were men who bad fought brave
ly, who had, stood wounds and the sur
geon's knife -without a murmur; who,
weakened and demoralized by fever
now, were weak and puling of spirit,
and sly and thievish; who would steal
the food of the very comrades for
whom a little while before they had
risked thefr lives â men who in a fort
right had fallen from a high plane of
life to the pitiful level of brutes. Only
here and there was an exception. This
man. Crittenden. was one. When sane,
he was gentle, uncomplaining,, consid
erate. Delirious, there was never a
plaint in his \-oice; never a word passed
his Ups that his own mother might not
hear; and when his lips closed, an un
daunted spirit kept them firm.'
"Aren't you tired?"
The nurse shook her head.
1 "Then you had better stay where you
are; his case is pretty serious. I'll do
your work for you."
The nurse nodded and smiled. She
v.-as tired and worn to death, but she
sat as she was till dawn came over the
sea. for the sake of the girl, whose
fresh, young face she saw above the
sick man's heart. And she knew from
the fac<Â» that the other woman would
have watched just that way for her.

"AH right." raid Willings. kindly.
"Well, there's RTit for you," said the
other surgeon. "We'll take him next."
"Straighten him out there, won't
you?" said Crittenden. gently, as the
two men etooped for him.
THE man would die and be thrown
Into that trench; or he might.
and never know! He raised him
self on one elbow again and
dragged his quivering body after
it; he clinched his teeth; he could hear
them crunching again; he was near him
now; he would not faint; and then the
blood gushed from his mouth and he
felt the darkness coming again, and
again he heard:
"Judithâ Judith!"
Then there were footsteps near him
and a voice â a careless voice:
"He's gone."
He felt himself caught, and turned
over; a hand was put to his heart for a
moment and the same voice:
"Bring in that other man; no use
fooling with this one."
When the Iicht came back to him
again, he turned his head feebly. The
shape was still there, but the moon
light had risen to the dead man's breast
and glittered on the edge of something
that -was still clinched in his right hand.
It was a miniature, and Crittenden
stared at itâ unwinkingâ stared and
stared while it slowly came into the
strong, white light. It looked like the
face of Judith. It wasn't, of course.
but he dragged himself slowly, slowly
eloper. It was Judithâ Judith as he
had known her years ago. He must
see now; he must see now, and he
dragged himself on and up until his
eyes bent over the dead man's face. He
fell back then, and painfully edged
himself away, shuddering.
"Blackford! Judith: Blackford! '
lie was face to face with the man he
had longed so many years to see; he
waf face to face at last with him â dead.
As he lay there, his mood changed
and softened and a curious pity filled
him through and through. And pres
ently he reached out with his left hand
and closed the dead man's eyes and
drew his right arm to his side, and with
his left foot he straightened the dead
man's right leg. The face was in clear
view presently â the handsome, dare
devil face â strangely shorn of its evil
lines now by the master-sculptor of the
spirit â Death. Peace was come to the
face now; peace to the turbulent spirit;
peace to the man whose heart was pure
and whose blood was tainted; who had
lived ever in the light of a baleful star.
He had loved, and he had been faithful
to the end; and such a fate might have
been his â as Justly â God knew.
Footsteps approached again and Crit
tenden turned his head.
"Why. he isn't dead!"
It was Willing?, the surgeon he had
known at Chickamauga, and Crittenden
called him by name.
"No, I'm not dead â I'm not going to
die."
WiUings gave an exclamation of sur
prise.

suffered and risked all the ills of the
war without one thrill of compensation;
and on again, until he was once more
on the edge of the Bluegraes, with
birds singing the sun down; and again
the world- for him, was changedâ from
nervous exaltation to an air of balm
and peace; from grim hlls to the rolling
sweep of low, brown slopes; from giant
poplar to broad oak and "sugar tree;
from log cabin to homestead of brick
and stone. And so, from mountain of
Cuba and mountain of his own land,
Crittenden once more passed home.' It
had been green spring for the earth
when he left, but- autumn in his heart.
Now autumn lay over the earth, but
in his heart was spring.
As he 'glanced out of the window, he
could see a great crowd about the sta
tion. A brass band was standing in
front of the station door â some holiday
excursion was on foot, he thought. As
he stepped on the platform, a great
cheer was raised and a dozen men
swept toward him, friends, personal
and political, but when they saw him
pale, thin, lean-faced, feverish, dull
eyed, the cheers stopped and two pow
erful fellows took him by the arms and
half carried him to the station door,
where were waiting his . motherâ and
little Phyllis.' â¢..â¢Â¦â¢-Â¦Â¦,
And Crittenden was coming home â
Color-Sereeant Crittenden, who had got
out of the hospital and back to the
trenches lust in time to receive flag
and chevrons on Ihe very day of the
surrender â only to fall ill of the fever
and go back to the hospital that same
day. There was Tampa once more â
the great hotel, the streets, silent and
deserted, except for the occasional offi
cer-that rode or matched the deep
dust of the town, and the other sol-r
diers, regulars and volunteers, who f tad
suffered the disappointment, the heat,
sickness and hardship of war with little
credit from the nation at large, and no
reward, such even as a like fidelity In .
any path of peace would have brought
them.
The two walked toward the cabin,
the negroes crowding about Bob and
shaking him by the hand and asking
a thousand absurd questions: and Bob.
while he was affable, was lordly as well,
and one or two of Bob's possible rivals
were seen to sniff, as did other young
field hands, though Bob's mammy was,
for the first time in her life, grinning:
openly with pride in her "chile," and
she waved the curious away and took
the two in her own cabin, reappearing
presently and walking toward the
kitchen. ! ...
Bob and Molly sat dov.n on opposite
6ides of the fireplace. Bob triumphant
at last, and Molly watching him fur

"I believe you has sc-hiethin* to say

"Well, I sut'nly is Â£la<I to welcome

said Molly.

Molly began to weaken slightly.

"Well, is you sorry?"
Molly was silent.

In a moment Bc-b was by her side,
and with 1 is arm around her: and
Molly rose to her feet with an ineffect
ual effort to unclasp his hands.
"Quit ro* foolin'!"
Bob's stron? arms began to tighten,
and the girl in a moment turned and
gave away into his arms, and with her
head on his shoulder, began to cry..
But Bob knew what sort of tears they
were, and he was as gentle as though
his skin had been as white as was his
heart.
Mo-lly came out embarrassed, twist
ing a corner of her apron and putting
it in her mouth while she walked for
ward and awkwardly shook hands.
"I think Molly has got something to
say to you. Bob. You can go, Molly,"
she added, smiling. .â¢ â¢ '.'
"No, Bob, he's coming home now,"
and Bob's eyes streamed. "You've been
a good boy, Bo& Come neVe;" and she
led him into the hallway and told him
to wait, while she went to the dcor of
her room and called some one.

had slipped aboard a transport and
gone off with the Kentucky Legion for

without daring to look backward for

in another moment she must have gone
and put her arms about him; took on a
sudden, hard quiet; and the Ions an
guish of the summer came out sud
denly in her trembling lips and the
whiteness of her face.
"To ask for forgiveness," he might
have said; but his instinct swerved
him; and â
"For mercy, Judith," he would have
said, but the look of her face stopped
the words in an unheard whisper; and
he stooped slowly, feeling carefully for
a step, and letting himself weakly down
in a wav that almost unnerved her
again; but he had begun to talk now,
quietly and evenly, and without look
ing, ud at her.
"I'm not going to stay long. I'm not
going to worry vou. I'll go awav in
'just a moment: but I had to come: I
had to come. I've been a little sick,

that, and that'sâ whyâ I've â come. It
Isn't the fever. Oh, no; I'm not sick at
all. I'm very well, thank you â -"
He was getting incoherent and he
knew it, and stopped a moment.
"It's you, Judith "
He stopped again, and with a painful
effort went on slowly â slowly and QUlet
ly, and the girl, without a word, stood
still, looking down at him. ' ,
"I âused âto â think â that â I â
lovedâ you. I â used â to â think I
was â aâ man. I didn't know what love
was, and I didn't know what It was to
be a man. I know both now, thank God,
and learning each has helped me to
learn the other. If I killed all your

you must have known, Judith, that I

He rose very slowly, turned, and as
he passed from the light, his weakness
got the better of him for .he first time,
because of his wound3 and sickness,
and his voice broke In a half sob â the
sob that is so terrible to a woman's
ears; and she saw him clinch his arms
fiercely around his breast to stifle it
â¢ Â¦ â¢ â¢
. It was the old story that nightâ the
story of. the summer's heat and horror
and suffering â heard and seen, and
keenly felt in his delirium; the dusty.
grimy days of drill on the hot sands of
Tampa; the long, long, hot wait on the
transport In the harbor; the stuffy, ill
smelling breath of the hold, when the
wind was wrong; the march along the
coast and the grewsome life over and
around himâ buzzard and strange bird
in the air, and crab and snail and liz
ard and scorpion and hairy tarantula
scuttling through the tropical green
rushes along the path. And the hunger
and thirst and heat and dirt and rolling
sweat of the last day's march and
every detail of the day's flsht: the
stench of dead horse and dead man;
the shriek of shell and rattle of mus
ketry and yell of officer; the slo-ir rush
through the long grass and the climb
up the hfll. And always, he was
tramping, tramping, tramping through
the long, green, thick grass. Sometimes
a kaleidoscope series of pictures would
go Jumbling through his brain. ' as
though some imp were rolling the scroll
of his brain backward, forward and
sidewise; a whirling cl.ud of sand, a
driving sheet of visible bullets; a hose
pipe that shot streams of melted steel;
a forest of smokestacks; the Cash of
trailing phosphorescent foam; a clear
sky, full of stars â the mountains clear
and radiant through sunlit vapors;
campflres shooting flames Into the
darkness, and men and guns moving
past them. Through it all he could feel
his legs moving and his feet tramping,
tramping, tramping through long- gTeen
grass. Sometimes he was tramping to
ward the figure of a woman, whose face
looked like Judith's; and tramp as he
could, he could never get close enough
through that grass to know whether it
was Judith or not. But usually It was
a hill that he 'was tramping toward,
and then his foothold was good; and
while he Went slowly he got forward
and he reached the hill, and he climbed
it to a queer looking little block house
on top, from which queer looking little
blue men were running. And now and
then one would drop and not get up
again. And by and by came his time
to drop. Then he would begin all over
again, or he would go back to the
coast, - which he preferred to do, in
spite of his aching wound, and the long
wait in the hospital and the place
where poor Reynolds was tossed into
the air and Into fragments by a shell:
in spite of the long walk back .to Sib
oney; the graves of the Rough -Riders
and the scuttling land-crabs; and the
heat I and the smells. Then he would
march back again to the trenches" In
his dream, as he had done in Cuba
when he got out of the hospital. There
was the hill up which he had charged.
It looked like the abode of cave-dwell
ersâso burrowed was It -with bomb
proofs. He could hear the shouts of
welcome as his comrades and men, who
had never spoken to him before,
crowded about him..
How often he lived through that last
proud little" drama of his soldier life*
There was his captain wounded, and
there was the old sergeantâ the "Gov
ernor" â with chevrons and a flag.
"You're a sergeant. Crittenden," said
the captain.
He, Crittenden, in blood and sym
pathy *the spirit of secessionâ bearer
now of the stars and stripes! How his
heart thumped, and how his. head
reeled when he caught the staff and
looked dumbly up to the folds; and in
spite of all his self-control, the tears
came, as they came again and again in
his delirium. .
Right at that moment there was a
great bustle in camp. And still holding
that flag, Crittenden marched with his
company ud to the trenches. There
was the army drawn up at parade, in
a great ten-mile half circle and facing
Santiago. There were the red roofs of
the town, and the batteries, which
were to thunder word when the red and
yellow flag of defeat went down and
the victorious stars and stripes rose
up. There were little men in straw hats
and blue clothes, coming from Santiago
and swinging hammocks and tethering
horses in an open field, while more lit

CRITTENDENgiven her the locket and had. told .her
the storv of that night in the hospital.
She had shown no surprise,, and but
very little emotion; moreover, she was
silent. And Crittenden, too. was silent,,
and, as always, asked no questions. It
was her secret: she did nob wish him
to know, and his trust waa unfaltering.
Besides, he had his secrets as well. He
meant to tell -her some day, and she
meant'to tell him: but the. hours were
so full- of sweet companionship that
both forbore to throw \he semblance of
a shadow on the sunny days 'they spent
together.
It was at the stiles one night that
Judith handed* Crittenden 'back the
locket that had come from the stiffened
band of the Rough Rider, . Blaekford,
along with a letter, stained, soiled, un
stamped, addressed to herself, marked
on the "envelope, "Soldier's letter," and
countersigned by his captain. .
"I heard him say at Chickamauga
that he was from Kentucky," ran the
letter, "and that his name was Critten
den. I saw yenr'name on a piece cf
paper that b!ew\ put, of his tent one
day. I jyuessed what was between you

watch out for him as- long as I am
alive. I shall be. shot. It-is no premoni

still have the locket you gave me. If I.

would know who>I am. and it seems
your wish. that he should not know. I
should like to see you once more, but I
should not like you to* see me. I am

were still browsing â out of the quiet

sweetness of it all came his last vision â
the vision of a boy with a fresh open
face and no shadow across the mirror
of his clear eyes. It looked like Basil,
but it was "the little brother" c-f him
self coming back at last â coming with
a glad, welcoming smile. The little
man was running swiftly across the
fields toward him. He had floated light
ly over the fence, and was making
straight across the yard for his win
dow; and there he rose and floated in,
and with a boy's trustfulness put his
small, chubby hand in the big brother's,
and Crittenden felt the little fellow's
cheek close to his as he slept on, his
lashes wet with tears. .
The mother opened the door; a tall
figure slipped gently In; the door was
closed softly after it again,. and Judith
was alone; for Crittenden still lay with
his eyes closed, and the 1 girl's face whit
ened with pity and flamed slowly, as
she slowly slip'ped forward and stood
looking down at him. As she knelt
down beside him, something that she
held in her hand clanked s'oftly^against
the bed and Crittenden opened his
eyes.
"Mother!"
There was no answer. Judith had
buried her face in her hands. A s<5b
reached his ears and. he turned quickly.
"Judith." he said; "Judith," he re
peated, with a quick breath. "Why, my
God, you! Why â youâ you've come to
see me! you, after allâ you!"
He raised himself slowly, and as he
bent over her, he saw his father's
sword, caught tightly in her j white
handsâ the old sword that was between'
him and Basil to win and wearâ and he
knew the meaning of it all. and he had
to steady himself to keep back his own

the sward, green with the curious
autumn-spring that . comes In that
bluegrass land: a second spring that
came every year to nature, and was
coming this year to him. And in his
mood for field and sky was the old,
dreamy mistiness of pure delight-^splr-
Itualâ that he had not known for many
years. It was the spirit of his youth
come backâ that distant youth when
the world was without a shadow; when
his own sour had no tarnish of evil;
when passion was unconscious and
pure; when his boyish reverence was
the only feeling he. knew toward every

sank and the shadows stole slowly
across the warm bands of sunlight, and
the meadow-lark called good-night

Crittenden went to bed that day and
lay there delirious and In serious dan

the end a reward came for all the ills
of his past and all that could ever come.
His long fight was over, and that after
noon he lay by his window, which was
open to the rich, autumn sunlight that
sifted through the woods and over the
pasture till it lay in golden sheens
across the fence and the yard and
rested on his window-sill, rich enough
almost to grasp with his hand, should

the crisis, when his mother was about
to go to the girl, Judith had come of
her own accord to his bedside. He did
not know her, but he grew quiet at
once when the girl put her hand on his

"And Ood was . good .that Christmas.
The day was snapping cold, and just a
fortnight tiefore Christmas eve. There
had been. a heavy storm of wind and
sleet the night before, and theWgroe3
of Canewood, headed by Bob and Uncle
Ephraim. were searching the woods for
the biggest fallen oak they could find.
The frozen grass "was strewn' with
wrenched limbs, and here and there
was an ash or a sugar tree splintered
and .prostrate,' but wily Uncle Ephraim
was; looking for' a yule log that would
burn' slowly and burn'long; for as long
as the log burned, just that long lasted
the holiday "of every darky, pn the place.;
So the search was careful and lasted
till a'yell rc-se from Bob, under a cliff by
the side of the creekâ a yell of triumph
that sent the negroes in a rush toward
him. "Bob stood on the torn and twisted
roots of a" great oak.that wind and ice
had tugged from its creek- washed roots
and stretched parallel with the waterâ
every tooth showing delight in his find.

Crittenden looked inquiringly into her
eyes, before he stooped to kiss her.' She
answered his look.
"Yes," she said simply; "when I .sent
him a war." * .
Crittenden's conscience smote him
sharply. What right had he to ask
such a .cuestion â even with a look?
'â¢Come; dear," he^said; "'I want to tell
you all â now."
But Judith stopped him with a ges
ture.
"Is there anything that may cross
your life hereafter â or mine?"
"No, thank God; no.""
Judith put her finger on his lips.
"I don't want to know."
"Why, Phyllis."
Phyllis was giving way. and. there
upon, with her own mother and Basil's
mother looking on, and to Basil's
blushing consternation, she darted for
his neck-band and kissed him on the
throat. The throat flushed, and In the
flush a tiny white spot showed â the
mouth of a tiny wound where a'Mau
ser bullet had hissed straight through.
Then the old auditorium again, and
Crittenden, who had welcomed the Le
gion to camp at Ashland, was out of
bed, against the doctor's advice, to wel
come it to home and fireside. And
when he faced the crowdâ If < they
cheered Basil, what did they do now?
He was startled by the roar that broke
courteously. And there were American Â«
officers jumping across the trenches to i
meet them, and while they were shak- <
ing hands, on the very stroke of twelve, i
there came thunder â the thunder of â¢
two-score and one salutes. And the <
cheers, gathering volume as they came, <
swinging through the center far to the 1

back again, until they broke in a wild i

Banner"â and the soldiers cheering and j
cheering again. Suddenly there was ,
quiet; the bands were playing hymnsâ (
old, old hymns that the soldier had (

knee, or In some little old country ,
church at home â and what hardships, j

nowâ they brought tears. Then some '
thoughtful soldier pulled a bc-x of hard- '
tack across the trenches and the little '

boys and scrambled like pickaninnies '
for a penny.
Thus it was that day all around the
shining circle of sheathed bayonets, si
lent carbines, and dumb cannon-mouths
at the American trenches around San
tiago, where the fighting was done.
And on a little knoll not far away
stood Sergeant Crittenden, swaying on
his feetâ color-sergeant to the folds of
the ever- victorious, ever- beloved Old
Glory waving over him. with a strange
new wave of feeling surging through
him. For then and there, Crittenden.

through a travail of wounds, suffering,
sickness, devotion and love for that flag ,
â Crittenden, American, was born.

Autumn came and the Legion was
coming home â Basil was coming home.
And Phyllis was for one hour haughty
and unforgiving over what she called
his shameful neglect and. for another,
in a fever of unrest to see him. No,
she v as net going to meet him. She
would wait for him at her home, and
he could come to her there with the
honors of war on his brow and plead

least that was the picture "that she
sometimes surmised in her own mind,
though she did nqt'want Basil kneeling
to anybody â not even to her.
The town made ready and the spirit
of welcome for the home-coming was
oddly like the spirit of God-speed that
had followed them six months before;
only there were more smiling faces,
more and madder cheers, and as
many tears, but this time they were
tears of joy. For many a mother and
daughter who did not weep when father
and brother went away, wept now, that

one moment of recompense that was
the soldier's reward and his sole oppor

ple gave them all the deserved honor
that they would have given had they
stormed San Juan or the stone fort at
Caney. The change that even In that
short time was^wrought In the regi
ment, everybody saw; but only the old
ex-Conlederates and Federals on the
street knew the steady, veteran-like
swing of the march and felt the solid
unity of form and spirit that those few
months had brought to the tanned
youths who marched now like soldiers
indeed. And next the colonel rode the

they cheered him, and how the gallant,

as though to say:

to him! give it to him!"
Phyllisâ her mother and Basil's moth

with Basil when she saw him first at
the old woodland, and Basil blushed
like a girL They fell behind as the
older people walked toward the audi

to the neck of his blouse, and filled
with tears. Sho began to cry softly.

THE END.
Judith was standing in the drawing
room on his hearth, looking into nis
fire and dreaming. Ah, God, to think
that it should come to pass at last!
He entered so softly that she did not
hear him. There was no sound but the
drowsy, tick of the great clock In the
hall and the low song of the fire.
"Sweetheart!"
Then came toasts after the old fash
ion â graceful toast3 â to the hostess and
the brides, to the American soldier,
regular and volunteer. And at the end.
Crittenden. regular, raised his glass and
there was a hush.
It was sood. he said, to go back to
the past: good to revive and hold fast
to the ideals that time had proven best
for humanity; good to go bade to the
earth, like the Titans, for fresh
strength; good for the man, the State,
the nation. And It was best for tie
man to go back to the ideals that had
dawned at his mother's knee; for there
was the fountain-head of the cation's
faith in its God. man's faith In his
nation â man's faith in his fellow and
faith in himself. And he drank to one
who represented bis own early Ideals
better than he should ever realize them
for himself. Then he raised his glass*
smiling, but deeply moved:
"My little brother."
He turned to Basil when he spoke
and back again to Judith, who, of all
present, knew all that he meant, and he
saw her eyes shine with the sudden
light of tears.
At last Came the crack of wheels on
the snow outside, the cries of servants*
the good-bys and good wishes and con
gratulations from one and all to one
and all; the mother's kiss to Basil asd
Phyllis, who were under their mother's
wing; the last calls from the doorway;
the light of lanterns across the fields;
the slam of the pike gateâ and. over ths
earth, white silence. The mother kissed
Judith and kissed her son.
"My children!"
Then, as was her custom always, she
said simply:
"Be sure to bolt the front door* my
son." .
And, as he had done for years, Crit
tenden slipped the fastenings of the big
hall door, paused a moment, and looked
out. Around the earner of the still
house swept the sounds of merriment
from the quarters. The moon had risen
on the snowy fields and white-cowled
trees and draped hedges and on the
slender white shaft under the bent
willow over his father's and his uncle's
grave â the brothers who had fought
face to face and were sleeping side by
side in peace, each the blameless gen
tleman who had reverenced his con
science as his king. and. without re
gret for his way on earth, had set bis
foot, without fear, on the long way Into
the hereafter.. For one moment â¢ his
mind swept back over the short, fierce
struggle of the summer.
As they had done, so he had tried to
do; and as they had lived, so he, with
God's help,, would live henceforth to the
end. For a moment he thought of the
flag hanging motionless In the* dim
drawing-room behind himâ the flag of
the great land that was stretching out
its powerful hand to the weak and op
pressed of the earth. And then with a
last look to the willow and the shaft
beneath, his lips moved noiselessly:
"They will sleep better to-night,**
Us yielded. So early that afternoon
she saw together Judith, as pure and
radiant as a snow-hung willow in the
sunshine, and her son, with the light in
his face for which she had prayed so
many yearsâ saw them standing to
gether and clasp hands forever. They
took a short wedding trip, and that
straight across the crystal fields, where
little Phyllis stood with Basil in uni
formâstraight and tall and with new
lines, too, but deepened merely, about
his handsome mouth and chin â waiting
to have their lives made one. And.
meanwhile. Bob and Molly too were
making ready; for if there be a better
hot-bed of sentiment than the mood of
man and woman when the man is go
ing to war. It is the mood of man and
woman when the man has come home
from war: and with cries and grunts
and great laughter and singing, the
negroes were pulling the yule-log from
its long bath and across the snowy
fields; and when, at dui.: the mother
brought her two sons and her two
daughters and the Pages and Stantons
to her own roof, the big log. hidden bjr
sticks of pine and hickory, was sputter-
Ing Christmas cheer with a blaze and
crackle that warmed body and heart
and home. That night the friends came
from afar and near: and that night
Bob. the faithful, valiant Bob. In a
dress-suit that was his own and new,
and Mrs. Crittenden's own gift, led the
Â¦aucy Molly, robed as no other dusky
bride at Canewood -was ever arrayed.
Into the dininsr-rc-ORi. while the serv
ants crowded the doors and hallway
and the white folk climbed the stairs to
give them room. And after a few sol
emn moments. Bob caught the girl In
his arms and smacked her lips loudly.
"Now, gal. I reckon I got yer!" he
cried; and whites and blacks broke Into
Jolly laughter, and the music of fiddles
rose in the kitchen, where there was a
feast for Bob's and Molly's friends.
Rose, too, the music of fiddlers under
the stairway in the hall, and Mrs. Crit
tenden and Judge Page and Crlttenden
and Mrs. Stanton. and Judith and Basil
and none other than Grafton and radi
ant little Phyllis led the way for the
opening quadrille. It was an old-fash
ioned Christmas the mother wanted,
and an old-fashioned Christmas, with
the dance and merriment and the
graces of the old days, that the mother
had. Over the portrait of the eldest
Crittenden. who slept in Cuba, hung the
flag of the single star that would never
bend its colors again to Spain. Above
the blazing log and over the fine
strong face of the brave father, who
had fought to dissolve the Union, hung
the stars and bars â proudly. And over
the brave brother, who looked down
from the north wall, hung proudly the
stars and stripes for which ha had
given his young life.
against the roof. As he stood there,
still pale, erect, modest, two -pairs of
eyes saw what no other eyes saw. two
minds were thinking: what none others
were â the mother and Judith Page.
Others saw him as the soldier, the gen
erous brcther. the returned hero. Thesa
two looked deeper and saw the
man who had been forgeS from dross
by the nre of battle and fever and the
nre of love. There was much humility
in the face, a new fire in the eyes, a
nobler bearingâ and his bearing had al
ways been proudâ a nobler sincerity, a
nobler purpose.
He spoke not a word of himselfâ not
a word of the sickness through which
he had passed. It was of the long pa
tience and the patriotism of the Amer-,
lean soldier, the hardship of camp life,
the body-wearing travail of the march
In tropical heat. And then he paid his
tribute to the, regular. There was no
danger of the volunteer failing to get
credit for what he had done, but the
regular â there was no one to speak
for him in camp, on the transports, on
the march. In tropical heat, and pn the
battle-field. He had seen the regular
hungry, wet, sick, but fighting still:
and he had seen him wounded, dying,
dead, and never had he known anything
but perfect kindness from one to the
other; perfect courtesy to outsider;
perfect devotion to officer, and never a
word of complaint â never one word
cf complaint.
"Sometimes I think that the regular
who has gone will not open his lips if
the God of Battles tells him that not
yet has he earned eternal peace."
As for the war itself, 'it had placed
the nation high among the seats of* the
mighty. It had increased our national
pride, through unity, a thousand fold.
It would show to the world and to our
selves that the heroic mold in which
the sires of the nation were, cast is

to show that the relations between
China and Korea were those of a
suzerain power and a tributary state.
If they were so, at least the Koreans â
certainly the people most directly con

tried to penetrate the forbidden land.
It was generally thought that the ob

However, the fault seems to be in the
race rather than in the individual.
The Koreans have lived too long with
no admixture of fresh blood.

since the war with China, a company
in which were interested many promi

diplomacy, of course, made the most
of the opportunity. For a few months
practical anarchy reigned throughout
the country, and at last the King In
fear of his life took refuge in the Rus

whatever pretense of independence
Korea up to that time had maintained.
For seven years now the only power

found themselves right In the midst
of things.
The first and the most prominent of
these advisers -who had been loaned to
the Koreans regardless of cost was Mr.
Hoshl Toru. afterward Japanese Min
ister In Washington, where he became
celebrated for hi3 close study and ad
miration of the Tammany system of
political organization. He tried to
Introduce the system In Tokio, the
Japanese capital, and was promptly
assassinated. But in Seoul Hoshl was
a reformer of the most uncompromis
ing character and made himself most
cordially detested by the Koreans, as
I had ample opportunity of seeing.
Mr. Hoshl , knew a great many things,
but he had forgotten the fact, which
It Is especially well for reformers to
recall every now and then, that Rome
was not built in a day.
He made fun of the old customs of
the country. He even ordered the
Koreans to cut off their topknot hair
adornments. He said men were not
necessarily wise because they had hair
growing out of their ears, and he dis
couraged the- habit of Korean states
men of pretending they could not walk
and appearing at the councils of state
supported by their bond slaves. He
also ridiculed their flowing sleeves and
abundant skirts, which, as he said
quite truly, made it impossible for
them to work; but of course that was
just what they wanted. The, awful
fear of having some day to work was
the one preoccupation of the Korean
statement as long as the strenuous Mr.
Hoshl remained in the land.
Time went on; one tempest after
another disturbed that Korean teapot,
and the one thing that became at all
clear was the failure of reforms to
catch on and the ever Increasing
hatred of the Koreans of all classes
for their benefactors. Symptomatic
rebellions took place in various prov
inces, and at last the Japanese Minis
ter to Seoul, probably without the ad
vice and sanction of his Government,
determined upon a desperate act. One
night in October, 18 96, the palace was
surrounded by a battalion of Japanese
troops, and a body of soldiers and
Japanese civilians, some, at least,
wearing the disguise of Korean uni
forms, entered the. private apartments
of Queen Mln and murdered her.

At what followed Holy Terror burst

high-water mark of her artlstlo ambi

and book covers and photograph
frames, all of leather wrought in elab

covers were outlined willowy ladies,
who appeared to be absorbed In their
reading. The photograph frames and
the opera bags were etched in wreaths
and scrolls. One of the cushions was
of brilliant green leather and In its

When the portrait, the masterpiece,
chuckled Uncle Ben. "and here's the
$100. I'll give Walter another hun
dred before the thing comes off." '
"Dear old Uncle Ben, but what a
good man vou are!" Sarah said grate
folly.
"Yea, all wool and a yard wide,"he
replied as he pinched her cheek.
Three nights later at 11 o'clock at
night Sarah Jane â¢Williams tiptoed
softly downstairs and left the house.
There was a horse and buggy waiting
in the road for her â one ordered by
Uncle Ben. A young man followed
close on her heels and' took the lines
and drove away. As the outfit dis
appeared In the darkness the good
man waved his hat and chuckled.
It needs no Sherlock Holmes to
unravel the mystery. Sarah had
locked Walter in. and Walter was out
of it. The man who had driven off
with her to get married before a wait
ing minister in the nearest village
must be Harry Seymour. They would
see Niagara Falls and other wonders
of. the world on that $100, and then
come back for forgiveness.
"Walter, my boy," said good Uncle
Ben when through with his figuring,
"you part your hair in the middle
and have got a gold-filled tooth, and
you are a fool."
"Uncle Ben," replied the chagrined
and dejected distant relative. "you
conspire and plan and chuckle, and
are an idiot."
I can see him. That feller Harry ain't
no feller for you to marry. I didn't
have to look at him twice to see that
he'll never make a hustler."
"I don't see why," protested Sarah.
"Natur' didn't make him that way.
You'd never have a second dress to
your back if you married him. Better
give him right up now, and lemme
p'lnt you out a feller who'll make a
crackln' good husband."
"Who is it?"
"Your cousin Walter. He's fell in
love with you and can't sleen o'nights.
He's a feller who's goin'. to rip up the
ground all around some day."
"But t know I never could love him."
"One can do- a heap of things, my
girl, if they set- out to. You Jest go
around thinkin' about Walter from .
mornln' till night and you'll be lovin'
him Inside of a week."
"I don't believe father and mother
would like it."
"Say, now, that's the fun of the hull
thing," laughed Uncle Ben. as he rub
bed his hands together. "I've kinder
sounded your dad and mam, and they
ain't stuck on Walter. They can't
cotton to a feller who parts his hair
in the middle and has a gold filled
tooth. They might be opposed to a
marriage, but that marriage could
come off jest the same."
"How?" asked Sarah with consid
erable interest
"Lean your head down till I whisper
one word in your ear â elopement. If
you and Walter make up to each other
I'll help you plan an elopement and
put $100 In your hand for a bridal
dower. I'd Jest like to show your dad
and mam that there's other folks who
know a thing or two."
An Idea was trying to work itself
out in Sarah's mind, and she asked f o'r
half a day to think things over. At
the end of that time she accepted
Uncle Ben's proposition.
"Good girl!" he exclaimed as _he
kissed her. and smiled like a June
morning. "You Just go right ahead
lovin' Walter and when the time
comes I'll be on hand."
Sarah and Walter went ahead. As
he was no Â¦ great favorite of her par
ents she was not put to any great
bother. The most she had to do was
to hear him sigh and recite poetry
and apostrophize the rising and set
ting . sun. Backed ; and mrged on by
Uncle Ben, he finally proposed and
was inferentially accepteg. - This was
no sooner over than there was a fur
ther confab in the orchard.

' "The {right kind of a woman always
appreciates "a ; " proposal of marriage
from any manias a great compliment.
Coming from you It Is the much more
to be valued, but I cannot marry you,"
said the woman.
. "I have to thank you for having lis
tened to me so patiently. Might I tres
pass a little more upon your good na
ture and ask permission to discuss the
matter further with you?"
"No amount of discussion can profit
either of u^, so far as I can see. But,
as I have said, in asking me to marry
you a great compliment was paid me.
and In return for that compliment I
suppose that I owe you permission to
indulge your love for discussion or ar
gument."
"Thanks for the permission," said the
man, still in his stolf 1 manner. "I can
not recognize my proposal as. in any
sense, a compliment, but I am willing
that you should, if you wish, take the
manner in which I made it as a com
pliment. Recognizing the splendid de
velopment of your own logical faculties,
I have made my offer of marriage in
perfectly business-like form. I have
heard you often declare that a contract
of marriage is like, any other contract,
and should be entered into only when
both parties are fully aware of what
they are doing."
"Do" you think women are ever en
tirely consistent?" Interrupted the wo
man.
The man looked a trifle surprised, and
replied:
"At least, I give you credit for hav

do not mean that I have erred in my
manner of proposing, that you would
have preferred more of an air of ro

"Now the situation is something: like
"Far be it from me to say anything
against those estimable members Of so
cietyâthe old maids," said the man,
"but I do not think you will ever be
one of them. A wise man once said

"I hardly care to regard the matter
as one of prosecution and defense,"
said the man imperturbably, "but If
you wish to use the terms I am forced
to admit their applicability. Will the
defense rest its case on the testimony
submitted by the prosecution, or will it
elect to submit an argument?"
"The defense will submit an argu

that the match would be, as you say,
pronounced suitable by every one. As
for the two or three other men whom
you aver that I can marry at any time,
I cannot answer. I have., noticed . that
the number of my proposals has been
falling off of late, and attributed ' the
fact to advancing ageâ you were right
when you Bald I was 30. I may close
the discussion by saying that I have
made up my mind to become on old
maid."
"Does the prosecution here close its
case?" inquired the woman, laughing a
little.
this," continued the man in very much
the same tone of voice that he would
have used in arguing an Important case
before .the Supreme Court. "You are
29â or is it 30?â years old, have a repu

can, I know, marry any one of two or
three men who can offer you at least as
much as I, but modesty was never a
prevailing characteristic of mine, and I
have not feared to measure myself with
these other men.
"On the other hand. I can give you
pretty much anything you desire that
costs money. I stand well in my pro
fession, and have prospects of soon be
ing near the top of it. Altogether, I
am satisfied that any one would call
it a very suitable match all around."
"No," said the woman, reflectively.
"I can't say that I do, and yetâ 'Â»
"Perhaps," said the man, and now
his voice was very gentle, as though he
feared he might hero touch some old
wound unwittingly, "there Is in your
life some romance which I have not
guessed. Believe me, I would not
â¢wound you for worlds, and I trust you
will pardon my clumsy speech."
"Oh, I am not a blighted being, never
fear," this with a laugh that did not
ring altogether of merriment.
"Then your refusal to marry me !s
not based upon the ground that you
prefer some other man?"
"No. . I am not in love â with some
other man." ,
"Then why not marry me?"
"I have given you the best of all a

He had thrown away his cigar and
stood for a moment gazing out toward
the trees. Then he began to speak, and
his voice was harsh with feeling that
had been restrained.
"I think I quite forgot to mention one
thing in my proposal. I did sot say
that I love you very dearly; that, not
wishing to be a beggar of love, I have

altogether In vain â for, by God, I am
going to kiss you once, here and now. if
It means the loss of all the little that Is
left me of your regard."
He gathered her In his strong arms
and kissed her, not once, bat many
times, on her forehead, on her eyes and
on her lips, and then released her. with
the full consciousness that he had done
an unpardonable thins which he did not
regret.
But the woman held out her arms to
him and said:

HER SPLENDID INCONSISTENCY
He went back to his chair before
the fire and wondered If it would be
possible for him to locate her. He
fancied he would like to meet her and
There was longing for an under
standing and for a sympathy that the
known men had never been able to sat
isfy. Stanley could imagine that she
had relieved a Epell of despondency by
putting her thoughts on paper on the
fame principle that he talked to his
clog, or smoked an extra cigar. The
â¢ thing he could not understand was that
â¢a- woman capable of such depths of In
tellect and feeling should have had so
tilly an impulse and put the letter in a
library book.
There was no nama or address â at
least fhe expected no reply.
He got up from his easy chair and
walked to the window. A cold driz
zling sleet beat against the pane, and
the electric lights from the street
turned the night into a ghastly gray.
His dog had followed him and stood
with his forepaws on the window
ledge.
A sudden furious blast striking the
pane made the dog rub his head
against his master and whine his de
sire for comradeship and affection.
"Are you lonelv, too, old fellow?
Two old bachelors like us, living in a
flat, ought not to expect to be gay.
You ought to be glad that you are not
out in the Ftorm, you ungrateful
wretch." He stroked the dog's head
and thought of the loneliness expressed
in the letter he had Just read.
"By Jove, she knows the real ar
ticle. It must be the lonely-in-a-crowd
feeling. She seemed to be a society
womanâ the monogram on her paper
didn't indicate a poor girl working for
, her living."
This woman was tired and disap
pointed. She "had evidently expected
mere than she had found, and through
some whim had written all her disap
pointment and heart ache to the only
person that could fully understand it â
her ideal man.

selected on his way home. The sheets
of paper were unfolded and the letter
"began in a way that made him think
he had as much right to read it as any
one else. It was a love letter, undoubt
edly the whole heart of the woman was
Jn it, but it commenced "Dear Un

thought some silly school girl had put
It in the Look with the Intention of get
ting up a flirtation, but he realized that
it was a letter a school girl could not
have written.
"Darling," he said, sitting on the
arm of the chair at the same time as
arm of her chair, "I was seized with
a feeling of most abject humility, my
greatest desire was to be The Un
known Man. * **
Joan happened to have on the flimsy
black dress when he asked her. Its
soft trailing length lay on the white
fur rug as she sat by the open fire.
Stanley had forgotten there was ever
such an ailment as loneliness in the
world. If any one had asked him to
name all the elements In nature, he
would have answered, "One element,
happiness, composed of Joan, black
dress, white fur rug, and light from a
lamp with a pink shade."
"When are you going to write me
your second love letter, dear?" he
asked.
Joan looked surprised.
"Happiness and excitement haven't
caused your mind to wander, have
they, dear boy?" she asked In aston
ishment- "I haven't written the first
one yet." <

He took from his pocket the letter
to the "Unknown Man."
"Here's the first," he said, and
laughed at her confession when she
looked at It.
"John, I'm so glad you found It.
I've been in a constant state of morti
fication for three months about that
letter. I left it in the book while I
went for a drive to take away a blue
headache! Mother knew I had
finished the book and sent it to the
library before I returned. Didn't you
think It awful when you found It?"
He wrapped the fluffy black train
around her feet so that the fear of it
would not keep him at an unreason
able distance.
tone that perhaps bjid a touch of
jealousy In it.
"There's only one thing that worries
me," he continued meditatively, "how
could she have put that letter In the
book? I don't believe she intended to
do it, Donald, do you?"
"She's tall and slender and gray
eyed, Donald, and she Is about 28
years old. She has slender, white
hands with lots of rings, and she had
on a flimsy black dress that trained
after her on the floor. I generally
hate td keep jumping to avoid those
trains, ., Donald, but I swear I would
make a jumping-jack of myself for
ever to stay where I could see those
eyes. I'm going to call to-morrow.
If you were a man you could go with
me and see her smile. Well, old brute,
maybe you'll be a lucky dog some
day."
As the weeks went by they reached
a state of friendship that permitted
Don to go driving with them in the
trap.
"Old fellow," he said that night,
"you've seen her, you've seen her
smile, to say nothing of her gray
eyes. You know we never liked
women, but you don't think I'm a fool
to ask' her what I intend asking her
to-night, do you?"
The dog whined a low, melancholy
"She's all right, old boy. If I hadn't
read that letter I should never have
believed that she was lonely. I don't
see how such a beautiful woman could
be so lonely, do you?"
The dog whined a reply that the
master evidently took to mean that he
really did not see how It could be
possible. *
Don beat .the floor , with his tail in

which the mother would gladly place

matters will be attended to by the

for. other^reasons, the management of
the younger ch'ildren at least will be
almost entirely in the hands of the
mother.
thoughts and experiences as these, he
approaches the subject of the mother's
influence in the training of children.
Would that he cc-uld say something
which would help them to appreciate
their power over their children, even
long years after all other early influ
ences have been forgotten.
Almost all great men have - been
noted ' for their devotion to their
mothers. All have recognized her un
limited influence. ' Who can read the
history of Washington or McKInley
without being struck with t the "great
appreciation and. the loving' tender
ness "they' manifested toward their
mothers? How many will Join with
Lincoln in saying, "All I am, or can
be,' I owe to my angel mother?" -How
sweetly. Lord Macaulay speaks of his
parents; .of.the pleasure he had nest
ling close to his : mother's bosom: of
her ' good-night .kisses and loving
glances.: Until the' day of her death
his love never lessened. ~-.-. He <â¢ said,
"Years "have I passed away since , we
laid ; her beside my father In the . old
church yard;" yet still her voice whis
pers .from-: the grave .and. her eye
watches I over 1 me Â¦ as I -.visit V the spots
long since hallowed to the memory of
my mother." â¢- ; . . ...... .
Another one has well said: "Who
can fathom the depth of a mother's
love? No friendship so pure, so de
voted. The wild storm of adversity and
the bright sunshine of prosperity are
all alike to her; however unworthy we
may be of that affection,* a mother
never ceases to love her. erring child.
Often when alone, as we gaze up to
the starry heaven, can we in imagina
tion catch a glimpse - of the angels
around the 'great white throne' ;, and
among the brightest and fairest _ of
them all Is our- sweet mother, ever
beckoning us onward and upward- to
her celestial home."
Is it not true as has. been said:
"Better than all the' gaud of wealth,
better , than all the fastidious tastes
and refinements of luxury, better than
highest '.esthetic culture or intellectual
superiority, is the presence in the home
of one of these queens of the hearth,
whose realm is bounded by the affec
tions and well being of her, household?
Such mothers and suclr.jhomes will
send out sons puch as the world needs
and men delight to honor, and daugh
ters whose loveliest adornments are
the virtues and ' graces which they
possess." Â¦
If only the mothers, these patient,
long-suffering, representatives of the
Almighty, could but faintly appreciate
the grandeur of their office and their
unboundless power, and influence over
the present and future lives of 'their
children! It can^scarcely be overesti
mated. v ' Almost daily the writer has to
appeal to the most troublesome boys
and girls that are found among thou
sands.. Many are just one step from the
reform school or the Jail. A considera
tion of such places has little or no ef
fect upon them. / Â¦ -
; Harshness and threats make no im
pression. The most brutal punishments
by parents have, had no effect. The
last parent spoken to said: "I do not
want to commit murder; I have done
everything elsfrâ have even, by chain
and padlock. confined him to his room,
yet he is no. better.". , An appeal to the
love for his Â» mother .saved that; boy.
Such an appeal will generally reach
the : most stubborn cases. Even 'where
it fails. It comes* nearest to .'breaking
the chain* of 'habits which have^bound
them. The writer doe3 not : remember
a single case where this appeal did not
have great' influence. With such
broken her heart by some real or im
agined terrible acts. There may be no
servant, or what is just as bad, she
may have left or be about to leave. . A
hundred other troubles crowd fast upon
each other. Should she not feel free to
call for any assistance needed from the
father? Such is the time for showing
the flowers of appreciation. On the part
of too many there is a tendency to keep
air sympathy and praise until it is too
late. How many patient mothers would
be surprised if. 'they could see the flow
ers heaped upon their coffins and hear
the words of praise from lips which,
for years, had" spoken ; scarcely a word
of 'appreciation or sympathy! Truly, it
is time that the father awaken to the
fact that he has much to do. with the
training of the children. Surely he
owes to the home the best influences
of his life. It should not be a board
ing-house where he sleeps and eats arid
pays the bills. It should be the center
cf his life. â¢ .
Too m&nj fathers consider that, since
it is their duty to provide for the fam
ily, they have no duties in connection
with the training, of children. A mo
ment's consideration will convince
every thoughtful father that this Is not
the case and that, no-matter what suc
cess he may gain in his business or
profession, he Is a complete failure if
he has not proven himself a true hus
band and an interested and devoted
father.
At every point it is the father's duty
to stand ready to co-operate with the
mother in her attempts to train the
children. This duty becomes even
more Imperative as the child grows
older and approaches the time of going
out into the world.
If the father does not take interest
in the training of the children it will be
exceedingly hard for the mother, and
they will not generally be trained as
they should be; for there are many
things which can be learned only from
the father. While the home is the
mother's world, the father Is the con
necting link between the world and the
home. Each has a part to perform,
the performance of which is necessary
for the best results. When they do not
do so, the training will be as discord
ant as the song of two singers whose
voices are not in harmony.
One great trouble is that many men,
and not a few women, who are consid
erate of others all day, have little con
sideration for those in their own homes.
They have a pleasant word and smile
for every one until they reach. home,

Â¦women. It may be argued that in
some families, becaus* of pccul'ar
temperaments, the mother li better

father. The fact remains, however,
Â¦he Is the queen of the house, not the
kin*. /
which should be the most Joyous place
on earth â a place for which each has
reserved the most pleasant word and
happiest smile.
Every father should 'eel th - - bsolute
necessity of having the r -Â»ther under
stand that he is ready, willing and
anxious to gfve all possible assistance
In the training of children. Other things
being equal, his help c" ould te in pro
portion to the amount of time he spends
home. Some fathers are home so little
that children hardly know whom to call
"father," and are led to ask as did one
little fellow, "Mamma, who is that man
that whips us nearly every Saturday?"
Mothers and fathers should recognize
the necessity of co-operation
In the training of children. Vital as it
is elsewhere, it is even more important
here. There must be no conflict of au
thority, for it is one of the most potent
causes -.1) failure in the management of
children. It has caused the ruination
of more children than almost any other
mistake. When either corrects a child,
how often the other takes his part! Un
less there is marked injustice or bru
tality, that is not justifiable. It is the
surest way of making a child rebellious
against the j authority of both. The
sensible way would be to wait until
they are alone and then discuss the
matter in a reasonable way.
Soi..e fathers object to haying any
thing to do with the management . of
the children. .They say th:y 'aave many
trials during the day which a mother
cannot fully appreciate. " Let this be
granted. Is her sympathy rot ever
ready? On the other hand, it must also
be remembered that the mother has
many c^res which the father cannot
appreciate. If he would take her place
for one veek he would I more
about it, and, afterward, would have
plenty of sympathy. She works at

might make things seem to move eas

daughter had wandered from home
and had been lost in the whirl of sin
of New York. Having 1 had her own
portrait printed, the mother placed it
in a mission house where the fallen
creatures sometimes came for a crust
of bread or a kind word. The poor
fallen daughter saw the picture. Upon
the .floor she sank, crying "Mother!
my mother!" That mother's love so
melted her poor heart that she was
saved, and returned to her home' a
ransomed child.

SEVENTEENTH" TAlyK TO PARENTS
BY WILLIAM J. SHEARER
SUBTLE INFLUENCE OF FATHER AND MOTHER UPON CHILD
We can make them see the strong
undercurrent of fun that runs through
life: the gleams of pathos and humor
that illumine the most sordid and un
likely subjects; in a word, each one of
us is a maker of sunshine, . or a pro
ducer of -'gloom in himself and others,
and loved or disliked according to
which role he elects to play. Â¦
To be "merry and wjse" is not given
to all, but to cultivate the bright side
of things, to get a laugh out of un
promising material is open to every
one, and it Is astonishing how the habit
of laughter, once indulged In, grows on
us, till at last we come to recognize It
rfs one of the great sweeteners and pu-
i It may be taken for granted that
those having great possessions cannot
fool light-heartedly, for even as the
soldier with the lightest knapsack
steps outN Quickest, so are the rich
weighed down to earth v by the gold
taken out of * It, or rather the over
whelming responsibilities attached to
their 'position.
They may be the cause, and often are,
of others' light-heartedness. but sel
dom of their own; it Is the moderates
who inherit the earth, those who have
known neither starvation nor a ple
thora of the good things of life, and ft
is among them that we must look for
the "merry" men and women who
take the sunshine with them wherever
they go. and who.- whatever may be
their faults,. are loved | accordingly.
To turn always a brisht face to the
world may at first be difficult,. but how
quickly it becomes a habit, how great
is the reward! To call the diseased
mind out of its self-built dungeon; to
blow like a clean wind through the
dust and morbidity of the four-walled
life lived by most unhappy humans;
such is the mission of the cheerful,
the gay of heart, more glorious by far
than to go about preaching and teach
ing, and though they may have, their
own wry moments (where the light is
brightest the shadow Is deepest), they
are using up their "ounce of cheer
fulness" with which to serve God roy
ally.
Do not we all more or less hypno
tize each other, impress our own
moods on those near to us, elevating
or depressing their spirits, and for
cing them to look through our own
spectacles, rose-colored or blue, as the
case may be? May not we even nar
row and vulgarize their mental vision,
even as we have power to inspire them
with that larger . humanity which
throws its weight into the scale of
pity, not condemnation of its fellow
man? -
Be Considerate.
those above them in the social scale,
arid they will end by hugging them
selves rather on what they have than
desiring what would probably make
them no happier than that does
which they now possess.
. "There's always a little something â
she can't abide the mon," said one old
farmer to another, when bragging
about his daughter's married happi
ness, and while not unduly rejoicing
over those whom the -world envies, it
may console poor folks to reflect that
there is always "a little something" to
discount the happiness of fortunate
people, who. if we only knew It, deep
ly envy us, the obscure and happy.
They may have all the desire to fool
that we have, feel impulses as eager
to take life rather as a picnic than &
solemn feast, but they cannot escape
from their surroundings, or rather
from the circumstances that make
them famous or remarkable. Let us
then more happy, learn to fool gently,
fool wisely, and laugh while we fool,
encouraging others to a like pursuit,
only taking care that such fooling does
not degenerate Into ] sheer folly, or
worse â but to the honest and pure of
heart, to whom I especially address
myself, the practice Is more likely tÂ»
tend to their ennobling, than to their
deterioration.
It is a good world, a beautiful *rorld.
It is man himself who makes moat of
the trouble by indulging: In purely flc
tltlous desires and sorrows. Turning
his back on all the glories of the uni
verse, he fights tooth and nail for the
one bit of colored glass~that has caught
his fancy, only to discover its worth
lessness when seized; meanwhile he la
blind to all most worth having In life,
for are not his the sky, the earth, the
sea, his also the parks, the treasures of
picture galleries and museums, such as
the richest men alive cannot bring to
gether?
It might do some of us good If w
deliberately set ourselves to count up
the amount of pleasures we can take
for nothing; it would not hurt us In
deed to be vainglorious, and strut
about, vaunting the joys so freely
provided for us; we might even In
time come to patronize the multi-mil
lionaire who has not a tittle more
right in a superb sunset, a xpsy dawn,

When Brentano's changed the narai
of Helen Beekman's book from "Dainty
Devils" to "Mrs. J. "Worthlngton
Woodward" they doubtless did so to
placate the ultra-Presbyterian readers.
In a little note on the fly page of the
rechristened novel Brentano's stata
that the original title was found to be
misleading as expressing the character
of the book, hence the change. Cer
tainly the present non-committal title
jfemedies the difficulty; ' It expresses
nothing.
Helen Beekman certainly takes a
very gloomy view of New York societ. .
for its feminine half furnishes the
"dainty devils" of tabooed memory.
They smoke opium, drink whisky
straights before breakfast and gamble
their sweet lives away according to
Helen Beekman. Like some famous
painters, the author h; i mingled dirt
with her dull tints to make the pictured
dirt more realistic.
The author takes a pretty, naive little
country lass and drops her down in the
whirlpool of New York's creme de

Quiller-Couch
in Short Story
/N another part of this page there Is
an attempt to anaryze the work of
the peer among short story writ
ers. De Maupassant is an author who
is known best for his tales; his novels
fall far short of the standard set by his
other writings. With Arthur T. Qulller-
Couch a different condition obtains. In
the novel and the short story alike this
versatile young English writer seems
equally, proficient. Following closely
upon the publication of his novel, "Het
ty Wesley." comes a collection of his
short stories under the caption "Two
Sides of the Face."
Although Mr. Quiller-Couch seems to
have chosen an enigmatic name for his
book of tales, there being no apparent
applicability of it to any or all of the
stories, he has without question pro
duced a collection which deserves high
mention. Stories which do not rely upon
dialect for their cause of being, stories
which are free Trom the stereotyped
historical setting, stories which do not
breathe an evident cynicism, such as
do so many- of the current magazine
typeâ these has Quiller-Couch written.
In this collection of el tin short tales
the author has presented â¢ as many
widely differing romantic conceits. The
majority of them are stories of mys
tery, a fact which should at once
recommend them to all who have read
"Dead Man's Rock," for Instance Two
of them are cast in the humorous vein.
With one exception th#y all hark back
a hundred years or so to gain the hal
lowed touch of the past.
. One reading these tales cannot fail
to find a resemblance to Stevenson in
them. It is not a direct copy by any
means, but a certain indefinable touch
of R. ,1* S. which is evident. -. In

Horror on the Stair" . finds almost its
exact counterpart .in that., terrible
Novel Without
Even an Excuse
*T\ EALLY, it is sometimes difficult
A[ to take some of these novels seri
. VÂ»ously. One catches himself say
ing: "Does the author actually mean
that I should accept this or that sen
timent or situation as being worth
while?" Thus, trusting that belter is to
come and dutifully following the story
through to the end in the hope of
catching' something real good, the
reader suddenly turns-. the last page
and lo! it was not. That is "The Spirit
of the Service," by Edith Elmer Wood,
whose picture, decollete, adorns this
page.
If one is thoughtful and reads with
any degree of appreciation hi* must
necessarily ask himself what thÂ« thnmc
of the book is. What excuse had the
author for writing it? How well or
how ill did she succeed in developing
the central idea of the story? The
theme of "The Spirit of the Service"
might be the making of a hero; it
might be' what 1 (the author) think
of life in the navy: It might be a brief
review of the navy in the Spanish
War. Each Â«>f these . three ideas is
partially developed in the story, but
none of them are brought to a very
definite conclusion.
We learn from the literary review
er's notices which accompanied the
publication of the novel in question
that Mrs. Edith Elmer Wood, decollete,
is the wife of a naval officer, and is
therefore especially well qualified to
give a picture of life in that branch
of the service. But it is not the rule
that a stonemason can write a good
story about a 'marble quarry. Neither
does it follow that a naval officer's
wife can write a good story of the
navy.
Mrs. Wood follows the ; fortunes of
a certain Captain Cartwright from the
position of commandant at a navy yard
up to the position of hero of a devoted
nation. At first blush he falls afoul
of a low-browed political boss; the
boss sets in agitation several strong
centers in Washington and the captain
finds himself before a court of inquiry.
But the captain is a Democrat and he
escapes.
At this Juncture the love element be
comes timely and Sue and Barbara are
introduced. Sue is big, wholesome and
Calif ornian; Barbara is wizened, pes
simistic and New Englandishâ of
course foils,' the one to the other. The
girls sit up in bed In their robes de
nuit and philosophize upon certain
weighty, matters.
" 'Do you believe in divorced people
marrying?' exclaimed Sue, turning to
Barbara.

quietly. ;V< , -'. -..-Â¦:,: i

rigid simplicity about all of his diction

sonally. There are no digressions, very
little descriptions other'' than those of
physical manifestations and nothing
like a moral can be read either in or
betweenthe lines..
As lone as the great study of life

What Is Doing
in Book World
There . Is a Swedish author, Viktor
Rydberg, who has for many years
stood* as the popular . story teller of
Scandinavia, but whose works have
never been, translated for English
readers. A young Swedish attorney of
Washington,- D. C, Axel Josephsson,
has just completed the. task of present-
Ing ' Â§ Singoalla," Rydberg's best novel,
in English. It is a great boon to read
ers of this country that they are thus
enabled to read a remarkably fine
story." ( . . Â¦ ' , "
"Sinjroalla" is a tale of- the thir
teenth "century.' The scene is laid In
the â¢ heart , of the j Swedish forests,
where baronial customs were not yet
far "removed from the pagan ( society
of the post-Christian era In Scandi
navia. The whole atmosphere of the
book is of the wild and savage; it
nearly approaches ' the spirit of a
saga or ancient folk song. Its /very
primitive concept exerts a charm
which holds the reader.
The story has to deal with a certain
Erland, the son of a baronial lord,
whose manor is in the fastness of
Smal.ind. While yet a youth the
hero fails in love' with Slrigoalla, a
beautiful gypsy, girl, who returns ' his
passion and unites him to herself in
marriage "according to the mystic rit
ual of : her people. Through the
treachery of her own father Singoalla
is separated from her boy lover, never
to see him': again until he has learned
to forcet her. Then by the mystical
influence of the son which is born to
her by the Swedish youth she comes
to gain again the ascendency in Er
land's affections, but only by the dark
ened Avay of tragedy. The coming of
the Black Death forms a terrible cli
max to the plot and the story ends in
the midst of general wreck and ruin.
The chief merit of the book lies in
the powerful way in which the author
casts his tale into the grim mold of
legendary romance. The weird influ
ences of the j forest, the storm, the
1 ooding crags of the mountain peo
goblinr. such as are found in the
pie the tale with sprites and unseen
p.isan sagas. There is the eerie
spirit of the occult about it which
makes the reading fascinating. It

Two volumes, "American Humorous
Verse." and "American Prose Humor"
are published in octavo size by Herbert
S. Stone & Co., Chicago. They are of
250 pages each, and are collections of
humorous and witty verses. ' tales,
sketches, etc.. composed by the best
known American writers. Their chief
excellence lies In the fact that In vol
umes of convenient size there are
grouped one or more examples of the
work of laugh-producing writers of the
last fifty years. The book of prose-se
lections gives sketches of Artemus
Ward and Josh Billings, which are fair
specimens of the humor of nearly half
a century ago, and Mark Twain. Bill

Hobart and Billy Baxter show the re
markable diversity of their powers of
expression, and what most appeals to
the risibilities of the public of to-day.
All the selections are genuinely funny,
but perhaps the reader may, according
to his sense of humor, question the
choice of some of them as being the
very best examples of the author's wit.
The volume of verse Is. on the other
hand, much more satisfactory, and hers
one finds a large number of funny
rhymes with pointed wit by such hu
morists as Burdette, Will Carleton.
Holman F. Day. Eugene Field, Joel
Chandler Harris. Bret Harte, John

Russell Lowell and many others, who,

In concept the thing Is unique. Offend
â¢ing authors are haled before a high
court of literary equity, where their
sins against the ethics of literature are

foibles are then exploited by testimony

Nothing is so dreary as to find the
place for a laugh in a piece of humor
ous writing all marked out with stars
and yet to have no laugh forthcoming.

Carl Snyder's successful book, "New
Conceptions In Science," has been very
well received in Germany. Johann
Ambrosius Barth, the German pub
lisher, has now opened negotiations
with Harper & Bros., who publish the
book in America, to translate it into
German and issue it at Leipzig. As
the firm of Barth has high standing in
Germany, and particularly as publish
ers of authoritative books of science,
their appreciation of an American
work like Mr. Snyder's Is the more
notable. The book is also published
in England by the Harpers and has
passed through several editions there.
Mrs. Deland's satisfying stories, en
titled, "Dr. Lavendar's People," are
taking their place among classics of a
similar character. The London Athen
aeum compares the book with the best
English models of its kind and says,
"From beginning to end this book
forms delightful reading, in the sense
that 'Pride and Prejudice* and 'Cran
ford' are delightful." The thousands
of readers who know their Jane Aus
ten and Mrs. Gaskell will be thankful
to add the American Mrs. Deland to
that charmed circle.
The "Lounger" in the Critic says:
"Charles Battell Loomis has been
rather annoyed by being accused of
the authorship of 'The Literary Guil
lotine. 1 He requests me to say that
he has had nothing to do with that
book and has no knowledge of the
guilty parties. Any one familiar with
Mr. Loomis' gentle wit knows that
there is none of the sharpness of the

Beatrice Harraden's recent novel,
"Katherine Frensham," is having a
marked success in England, and. in
deed. In Europe, it having already
been translated In French, German,
Danish and Norwegian. Its success
has probably been due to the under
tone of tragedy and pathos that
gathers about the figures of Clifford
and his son. The book has the right,
healthful and courageous outlook on
life; and the story holds the interest
of the reader because of the mingled
humor and anguish that it contains.

Mr. Howells writing in Harper's
Weekly advocates a publishers' syndi
cate, or an authors' union, for the pur
pose of Improving the present unsatis
factory relations between the two. As
to the recommended labor union for
authors, Mr. Howells outlines a schema
for' a schedule of prices for fiction,
history, poetry, psychology, travel,
sketches, reviews; and penalties, direct
and indirect, for rating authors. "Of
course, the same prices must be paid to
poor authors as to good ones when once
they are members of the union." As to
the publishers, Mr. Howells suggests
that they should form a syndicate
"pledged among its own members to
the payment of such and such prices
to authors, and bound to an absolute
constancy In one another's behalf."
Robert Grant, in his new novel (the
opening chapters of which appear in
the current Scrlbner's), has taken for
a hero a sort of "smart" young man,
who served to make "A Modern In
stance" the best of Mr. Howells'
stories. Like Bartley Hubbard, Mr.
Grant's hero, Krnil Stuart, is a cheap
soul, full of fine phrases and a rascal
at bottom. Where Mr. Grant is di
verging from the plan of his brother
novelist is in giving the creature a
young wife of type infinitely superior
to that of silly Marcla Hubbard. The
action upon one another of these two
matrimonial factors is enough to make
"The Undercurrent" an inviting story,
but it is easy to foresee that it is to
'have a larger interest as a study of
American life and of American tenden

GUY DE MAUPASSANT is being
revived. A translated edition de
luxe of his complete works has
appeared in London and another
-complete edition is for the first time
on the American market. Lovers of
. literature outside of France seem to
have Just awakened to the fact that
â¢ in that peculiar genius who died in a
madhouse ten years ago there Abided
. a wonderful endowment of true artistic
â¢ genius.
â¢ De Maupassant is the peer in the
short story. There has never been a
master of this difficult art such as he.
XtemarkabJe It is that with the sudden
phenomenal Jump Into popularity which
this form of literary expression has
I made during: the last fifteen years such
a writer as De Maupassant should have
been known, in this country at least.
. Â«nly bv the unfortunate pirated yel
low back penny catchers which flaunt
kheir highly colored covers of erotic
. design from the news stands. The
worst of his writings only have passed
current in this country and those of
the sort which have difficulty in pass
ing throuch the mails.
But De Maupassant deserves a higher
" niche than that awarded him by read
ers of this sort of stuff. Because the
author was himself so frankly an ani
mal and hesitated not to mirror his
â¢wn self in some of his stories his
â¢ wortcs have all come under the signifl
.' .cam condemnation of being "French
novels" â a class tabooed, and rightly
so, by the honest reader. Aside from
these lapses inter the extreme, however,
De Maupassant has written some stor
ies which shou'.d be rÂ«-ad by every one
; who appreciates delicacy of conception
and lkn-h of technique. They are per
-. fection in the short story. â¢
In an essay upon "The Tale" Dt
' Maupassant enunciates the fundamen
tals of his artâ the art of a teller of
rc-aj stories of real life. He says:
TliÂ« . storyteller who pretends to
- KivÂ«- <in exact image of life must avoid
with t.ire all the enchantment of in
â¢ Merit* whkii would appear unusual.
His alrti is not to tell us a story to
iii:iUM' us or to make us sad. but to
forpe us to think, to understand the
-,Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦-Â¦Â¦. d and hidden meaning of every
day occurrences. It is a -personal view
of the world which he endeavors to
communicate to us by reproducing ii.
in his book."
A personal view of the world, an in
sifeht into the life of every dayâ these,
â¢ then, are the bases of De Maupassant's
. tales. By temperament, by the effects
. of environment, by the early teachings
. of Flaubert he was pre-eminently a
realist. He was not of the Zola na
. turalistic school, which does not fail
to make note of the fact that a green
and gray fly walked over the butter
on the breakfast table. Care for mul
titudinous details did not intrude upon
his keen sense of the real. Xot the
mess of irrelevant details meaning
.nothing nor the useless meanderings
of the naturalists were De Maupas
sant's, but only the outward . sym
bolisms of inward impulses; not a rep
â¢ resentation of life, but life itself.
De Maupassant's conception of life
es reflected in his tales is probably the
most thoroughly Gallic of any in
French literature. Life to him Is but
the futile battle against the mysterious
forces of the eternal fatalities â not a
battle, maybe, but a blind groping.
How pitifully insignificant are human
Joys, sorrows, vanities, follies â what
count they? Instinct alone rules the
actions of mankind. There is no soul.
There is no heart. Love is but the
impulse which draws together two
healthy animals. Death is ever at the
elbow and that is the end. Life is
, ridiculous.
Pessimism this is to be sure. A not
very pleasant or healthy inspiration.
But it is not the pessimism which led
the philosopher to commit suicide be
cause life was worthless. It is not a
BCholarly pessimism nor yet the lyric
. variety of the I3yronic school. If the
term may be used it may be stated
that De Maupassant's was a passive
pessimism â the kind which merely
shrugs its shoulders and turns to the
-absinthe glass. De Maupassant was
too much the man and too little the
philosopher to be of a pugnacious bit
'.t^rness.
This trend of thought of the French
tU/ry writer produces in his tales a
chairn which is felt, but which baffles
definition. All of his stories reflect a
commonplace existence; Into these
humdrum lU-es the author reads the
. pitiless workings of fate which makes
a nock of all efforts. The catastrophe
"has none of the melodramatic clash
and i^rar of the romanticists; it is not
precipitated by the fall of duty before
temptation. The tragic element is
rather reflected by a wholly physical
emotion of utter hopelessness before
â¢ the hidden terror of unseen powers. It
is subdued, though poignant." It in
duces in the reader an Indefinable,
sweet melancholy.
The characters "of De Maupassant's
stories are. for the most part, simple
unlovely bourgeoisie, government clerks
.or soldiers. He pictures their lives
truly; he 'reflects their emotions. But
â¢in all of his stories the writer remains
aloof from his character. There is
no injection of a part of himself into
them. He maintains a cold, sometimes
a sneering distance. By no words of
his are any sympathies aroused for the
people of his pen. He does not make
life, but simply reflect* it-
Of a necessity the style of De Mau
. passant cannot be maintained in the
transiat^pn. For those who cannot read
the original there is a loss, for his per-

nurse.
"How good it Is to be here again!"
said John after he had greeted his
aunts.
"Let me take Mary," Lucy begged.
Having a baby In the .house for two
long months was a most delightful
prospect.
Mary looked at her steadily for a mo
ment with blue eyes that had some
thing of the mystery and unfathomable
quality df the sea. Then she put out
her hands to go to her aunt Lucy.
"Dear little girl." said Lucy, taking
her on her lap and giving her a kiss.
"Lucy, you mustn't kiss the baby; It
isn't good for her," Deborah said warn
ingly. "And you hold her as if you
thought she was going to break."
"My baby isn't brittle," Esther re
turned gayly.
Lucy looked at the mother's bright
face. "There is such a thing as happi
ness In the world," she thought.
After the Forsyths had gone to their
rooms to get ready for tea' Miss Letitia
Â£aid: " Jack has grown a great deal.
He is much more of a boy than he was.
I foresee we shall have trouble with
him."
To which Miss Deborah replied, "Yes,
I am sorry he is so rough. I don't know
what we shall do with Mr. Gray."
"It is even worse than I expected/'
confessed Miss Letitia. "Lily Is less
quiet, too. I don't know how I am go
ing to stand the noise. I don't know
what Esther's nerves are made of. I
am thankful I never married."
"I am glad I never did. I thank
heaven every day. of my life that I
haven't a husband," declared Miss Deb
orah.
Lucy said nothing. Was Letitia,
who had been the beauty and belle of
Epplngham in her youth, reaJly satis
fied with her unstimulating life of In
dolence of body, joined to gentle activ
ity of mind? . Was this what it meant
to have ceased to be young? Should
she herself, in the years to come, learn
to be contented with her life of trifles?
Would there ever be a time when she
would not loowwith envious eyes at
the women who, like Esther/had the
fuller life, with its greater cares but
higher happiness? Deborah seemed
satisfied, too, but hers was the con
tent of the active woman who fills
every hour with loving, If sometimes
mistaken, service. They both seemed
happy with what they had arid . to
crave nothing more! â¢ Was it because
they had chosen their OAvn lives, while
she had been refused the choice?
How strange that this noisy inroad
of life from the larger world, that
filled her with such a keen sensation
of joy, should be merely tolerated by
them?

"Lucy, have you seen the cat?" Miss
Deborah asked two evenings later.
"No. "Didn't, you bring him in?"
"Of course. I did. I' took^.him out
for a little exercise, as usual, and then
I chained him up in the yard. I do
wish the Simondses would keep their
chickens in. the cellar, it would make
life so much simpler for us," she said,
with the gleam of humor in her eyes
that always accompanied an especial
ly preposterous remark. "Then I
brought him In and put him in the
kitchen, as I always do. And now 1
can't find him. Children," as Jack and '
Lily came rushing into the room,
"have you seen Mr. Gray?" '
"I let him out,", said Jack.
"You let him out! You naughty
boy! He will stay out all night and
probably â¢ be chewed up by a bigger
cat. Oh, my dear, dear Mr. Gray!
Jack, didn't you know you were very
naughty?"
"He seemed to want to get out aw
fully, Aunt Deborah. He was mew
ing like. fury. I didn't know it was
naugjity, truly I didn't. He is awfully
brave? Aunt Deborah, I guess he'll do
most of the chewing up."
. . "I suppose he'll eat about ,-a dozen
of the Simondses' c.hlckens," she said
grimly. "If you had only waited un
til I had given him his supper! But
he Is as hungry as a hawk. Well, the
only thing we can do now is to go out
and see if we can find him."
They made an imposing procession as
they set forth, Miss Deborah a:.: Lucy
In the rear, while Lily and Jack dashed
madly forward. Â«;
"What is the matter?" called Mis3
Letitia from the window, and when she
was told she, too, descended into the

saucer of milk in her hand, while John

from a walk, increased the number of

Lucy had. heard the news. She went
quickly downstairs and arrived in tims
to hear the greater", part of her sister's
â¢ speech. "If -she' will only keep on feel
ing so!" she thought.' "Mr. Gray is a
perfect dearâfor a catâ he Is a great
deal better than nothing, but the baby

To steal upstairs to* the nursery, to
sit on the floor by the hour together
.with baby Mary, to hand her a soool
of thread or a rattle, merely to have
her drop it with laughing glee, in order
that her devoted relative might pick
it up â to repeat this performance over
and over again, was the greatest hap
piness Lucy had known for years.
"Lucy, you must make a stand, or
you will be Imposed on," Miss Deborah

nature not to taka advantage of 'a

at home and look. after her own baby.
There is no occasion for her seeing so
much of her .girlfriends, and she and
John have surely- been married long
enough not to need so many tete-a-tete
drives." â¢ . .
' "But T love to take care of the baby,
and Esther knows she is giving me the
greatest possible happiness in letting

' "Oh, I suppose' they are as. consider

',Â» That; evening as tfie" Wyatts were sit
ting around their 1 cheerful tea table
;they* heard ; shrieks issuing from the
baby'srbom, as Esther camj out and
shut the 'door. John was taking tea with
his classmate.^Ned Simonds, and It was
Nora's evening out. Her evenings out,
by tl.e "A'ay, were of , frequent occur
rence.-for she was a young thing and
needed diversion. _
The sisters looked at each other for
a moment in a silence too shocked for
words. At last Miss Letltla Bald. "Do
you suppose she Is going to leave that
child crying like that?"
"It does not seem possible." said
Miss Deborah. .\
Presently Esther came gayly^lnto the
room. She bad been playing tennis, and
had come home just In time to give the
baby her supper and put her 'to bed.
Esther had on her bicycle . skirt, and
her pretty hair was curling in little
rings around her face, .while the exer
cise had given her a color even' bright*
er than usual. -
"I'm awfully sorry to be late. Aunt
Deborah," she said. "We were having
a most exciting tennis match; John
and I played against Frances and Ned

do you mind?" she added, noticing the
gathering cloud on the faces of her
aunts.
"I am wondering how you can leave
â¢ that poor child screaming upstairs."
Miss. Deborah said. ' ': Â¦Â£
Esther laughed. "It is nothing but
temper. She didn't want me to come
down stairs; the doctor told me not to
humor her." she added, as she helped
herself to tomato salad. "If I had
stayed with her to-night she would
howl like that every evening when we
leave her. Poor little soul, it seemed
very hard* hearted to come off, but
she'll get over it in a minute."
Lucy wondered how any mother
could take those heart-breaking
screams so calmly. Miss Deborah felt
indignant, and Misa Letitia was driven
nearly frantic by the noise. , - :
"Dqn't you think somebody had bet
ter go upstairs and stop her?" she
asked. "I have had a bad headache all
day. and although I dare say the dis
cipline of leaving her alone may be
Kood for her, it is just a little hard on
â¢'Oh', you poor dear," said Esther,
looking regretfully at her salad. "I
never thought of that. I'll go right up
myself," and she rose hastily.
"Let me- go." Lucy entreated. "I
have finished my supper."
"Lucy, you haven't eaten enough to
keep a bird alive," said Miss Deborah
reproachfully. "Let Esther manage her
own baby." Â¦ -Cr.-'-
Lucy gently pushed Esther back Into
her seat. "I would like to go to her,"
she said.
Shc # ran swiftly upstairs. Mary was
already crying less violently. Her rage
had given away to grief. If she had
the Forsyth temper, she had also in
herited the Norris disposition to make
the best of things. She was sitting up
in her crib, and her two dimpled hands
were put helplessly up to her rosy face,
Awhile the tears stood in her reproach
ful eyes.
"You darling." Lucy cried, catching
her up and kissing her with passionate
tenderness. "You little dear. Come to
Aunt Lucy, come, dear, dear baby,
and we'll 'Ride a cock horse to Ban-
bury Cress.' " Â£ .-
The baby, was much pleased with this
invitation, and subsequent events
proved that she was not too young to
learn the lesson of cause and effect.
When she was in New York she cried
in vain; nobody invaded her solitude,
but here it required only a few screams'
to bring a kind, yellow-haired lady with
a gently rustling gown, who took her
out of her wretched crib and danced
her on her knees, and this friendly
Aunt Lucy would stay until she was
fairly asleep and it was much more
sociable. Then there was one never
to-be-forgotten evening, when the yel
low-haired ,aunt was very tired and the
short; stout aunt came upstairs in her
place..; -i ;^ '
â¢â¢ '-Lucy'," Miss Deborah had said, "you

Lucy looked at the clock and became

and she lifted her out of thÂ» crib.

foot, she patted it vigorously as ah* re

came to â

Mary was delighted. She laughed up
roariously and put out the other little
foot Invitingly.
"Well, Just once more," said MlsÂ»
Deborah.
At the end of the second performance
the baby put out her right foot again.
"You little monkey," said her aunt.
"No more, positively no more."
Mary looked thoughtful, then sh*
put out her left foot, and. In accents
that would have melted a heart of
stone, she said "Debba."
When Miss Deborah at last went
downstairs her face wore* the non

not wish to be questioned.
"Have you seen the evening paper?"
Â¦he asked Lucy.

It was in vain for Mlsa Deborah to
try to keep her new relations with thÂ«

gave the situation away the very next
morning. "When she was brought

lap Miss Deborah began. "This little

stayed home," and so on down to the
line of Mary's small fingers.
"I am so glad we came on this sum

a fortnight later. "I was afraid the
baby would be too much for your
aunts. They were used to the other
children, and knew what to expect, but
the baby was an unknown quantity. I
didn't think Aunt Deborah would be
so devoted to her."
"That was only because you didn't
know Aunt Deborah. "
"Well, I know her now. I useil to bÂ»
afraid of her before I was married, but
she is the dearest old thing in the
world. I declare she grows younger
every day. Before long sheâ"
"You see, I was right in vetoing your
proposition to go to a boarding

Mr. Gray, who was lying on the
hearth rug. looked as if he hud his
own views on this subject.
"Poor old fellow," said Esther, tak
ing the cat up in her arms, "don't mind
what John says. He is nothing but a
clumsy man. You are nicer than he is
in ever so many ways. You never In

the last word."

THE arrival of the Monday even-
Ing mall was the chief event of
the week to the Miss Wyatts be
cause It brought the Xew York
letters. From the time that Mary
Wyatt had become Mrs. Amos For
eyih until Just before her death, more
than thirty years later, there had never
bean a break In the correspondence
save when the sisters were together.
At last there had come an anxious Mon
day evening when no letter reached
them, and later a few hurried lines
from Mary's son John, with whom Bhe
had lived since his wife's death, telling
of the illness of his mother; then a
telegram saying that all was over, and
finally that desolating gap that can
never be bridged.
"I suppose you have a letter for me?"
eaid Miss Letitia, as Lucy came in with
the Monday evening mall.
"That Is very strange. It is John's
turn to write to me."
Miss Deborah opened her letter and
gave En exclamation oL surprise.
"I hope thÂ«re is not any bad news? "
Lucy aeked anxiously.
"No. They are all well. John Is
proposing to bring all the family on to
spend the summer with us."
"Upon mv word, that is cool!" ex
claimed Miss Letitia, "It is very
strange he did not write to me when It
is my turn, and I am the oldest," ehe
added.
"I suppose he wrote to me because I
am housekeeper. Tou can answer the
letter if you like."
"J have enough letters of my own to
answer, thank you. I should think
Esther would have the sense to see
that it may not be convenient for us
to have two grown people and two chil
dren and a nurse and baby to spend the
summer."
'"She has," and Miss Deborah read
an extract from the letter.
"Esther tells me we are altogether
too big a family now to Inflict on you,
and as her father's house Is not large
enough to receive us she proposes our
going to Mrs. Homer Newhall's board
ing-house, but I told her my aunts
would fee! deeply hurt if we didn't
come to them. Of course. If for any
reason it is not convenient, you will let
us know frankly. I long to have you all
see Mary. She Is beginning to walk
and take notice, and yesterday she
electrified me by saying papa."
"John is a perfect fool over that
child." Miss Deborah observed. "Mary
is 13 months old and ought to have
eaid 'papa* weeks ago; Lucy said
'papa' and 'mamma' when she was
nine months old, and John himself â
and boys are not usually bo forward
as girls â began to talk when he
was â "
"For heaven's sake, spare us those
reminiscences," said Miss Letitia.
"What are you going to write to
John?"
*'Oh, I supose they will have to
come; but what on earth can we do
about Mr. Gray I don't 6ee. Jack and
Lilly will tease him outrageously, poor
creature, and he Is used to such a
placid life."
"I declare, Deborah, I believe you
put the cat's comfort before that of
your own family. I am used to a
placid life, too," Miss Letitia re
marked.
"You can protect yourself. If the
babV were only a little younger I
shouldn't mind bo much, but as soon
as a child is big enough to walk it is
big enough to get into every kind of
mischief. Dear, fascinating little
thing! I long to sÂ«Â»e her,. but I would
rather see her at the distance of Mrs.
Newhall's boarding-house."
'Then why don't you have the cour
sge of your convictions and say so to
John?"
â¢â¢Letitia!" Lucy cried reproachful
ly. "You wouldn't have the heart to
let them go to a boarding-house when
we have four spare rooms!" '/'-'- â¢, ;
â¢*Wf> can manage the room well
enough," said Miss Deborah. "We
ran give them the three south rooms
opening together."
"So you are planning to have me
move out of my room?" Miss Letitia
asked.
"Why, I thought you could move
Into mine, and I would take the little
room. It would be much more com
fortable for them to have *connect
inq; rooms and an open fire."
Miss Deborah had known her sister
for. more than fifty years, and her
faith in tho inherent unselfishness of
human nature was so great that she
could still make a proposition of this
kind.
â¢â¢Lclitia would never be happy In
any room but her own," said Lucy,
who had knocked her head against
her sister's limitations too often not
to recognize them. "It's no matter if
they don't have conectrhg rooms. The
nurse and the baby can be across the
hall."
' I am very sorry about poor, dear
Mr. Gray," said MiS3 Deborah, revert
ing to heÂ»r pet. "1 know that naughty
baby trill pull his tail and make him
very unhappy, and as for Jack and
j^j] v â¢â¢ Ndi
"John iÂ« a dear fellow," Miss Letitia
Interrupted, 'but, like all men, he is
selfish. It never occurs to him to look'
at things from any point of view but
h!Â» own." Â¦ .
They were coming, actually comlnf,
at last. Miss Deborah had gone to the
station to meet them, and Miss Letitia
and Lucy were waiting in the parlor,
which was gay with a wealth of roses
arranged in bowls and vases by Lucy's
skillful fingers. It was not often that
she was allowed to follow her own taste
entirely, even in small things, but the
others had been so busy with larger
decisions that they had left the cutting
and arranging of the flowers to her.
"My dear, you have a real genius for
fixing: flowers," said Miss Letitia, She
always recognized perfection when she
Â¦aw It, but her praise was given so
rarely that her words brought a glow
to Lucy's heart.
At last there was the sound of wheel*
on the gravel, then came a gay laugh
and a shrill voice called out, "Mr. Gray!
What an awfully funny name for him.
I thought he was a person when Aunt
Lucy wrote about him first. HI! Mr.
Gray, you needn't be so scared of me.
Hullo, Aunt Lucy!" and Jack rushed
into the room, closely followed by his
sister Lily. Next came John, carrying
the baby with patriarchal pride; then

her eyes that made the whole world

a remorseful sigh. There never was a
more unselfish, spontaneous, whole
souled woman than her sister Deborah.
Miss Deborah, meanwhile, had ap
proached the baby with feelings of ex
asperation. Of course Lucy had spoiled
the child. Lucy always did spoil every
body. If no one had gone up to Mary
that first evening no one need ever
have gone. Esther had been right, she
knew the characteristics of her" child
better than they did, but the mischief
had been done, and now it was for hr.
Deborah Wyatt. to discipline this smaU
piece of humanity, as she had discip
lined the baby's grandmother and her
great aunt Lucy.
"Well. Mary Forsyth." she began, as
she entered the nursery, "this is a

a smile that twinkles like a little lost

up into his lugubrious, face. "Why,

"Oh, nothing.** responded Dicky,
throwing himself down on the upper
step of the veranda.
"Yes there is," contradicted Nan,
extricating herself from the ham
mock. "Something has been doing,
and you must tell me all about It."

Nan loved to kneel In the bow and
watch the new unbroken water ahead
as they stole silently across the lake,
but instead she. seated herself among
the cushions facing him. She had a
tactful way. of adapting herself, to
other people's moods, that made her
a charming companion.
"Isn't it a corking day?" he said af.
ter a long silence while he sent the
canoe forging ahead under his slow,
powerful strokes.
"Yes," responded Nan absently, as
she trailed her hand in the water and
watched the .slow moving masses of
white cloud piling up Â»in the south.
"So Helen always likes to paddle, does
she?" she asked.
"Always," he assented. "She never
is content to sit still for two minutes.
She isn't a bit restful."
For a moment Nan felt inclined to
laugh. Dicky in his strength and with
his superb physique was the last one
who looked as though his nerves need
er a restful person to quiet them.
"She has such a lot of extra energy
and vitality that she has to do some
thing to use them up," she said.

Nan flushed with pleasure, though
he said it as he might have said it
to another mas.
"You see -what * hole Tm in," hÂ«
finished.'
"Yes." said Nan slowly. "Dick, I
would go slow. You don't want to
make a mistake. It would about
break my heart If you weren't happy."
She choked a little. . \
Dick leaned over and grasped her
hand. ,"You are a dear. Nan," he said.
"I. know you will stick .by me what
ever happens." He puffed away at his
pipe with his dark eyes fixed thought
fully on her face.
The next day Iran went away. A
mysterious telegram had called her
back to the great hotel where her
; family, was staying, and she left Dicky
feeling very lonely and forlorn.
She was sitting on the hotel piazza
one day a week later, a book open in
Â¦ her lap, but her eyes fixed dreamily
on - the distant mountains across the
lake," when she saw a familiar figure
swinging up the path .between the
pines that lead to the station. She
started up: and for an Instant her
heart seemed to stop beating! Then
the color surged back into her face
and she ran down the steps to wel
come him.
"Dicky." she cried. "How good to
see you. Why this sudden appari
tion?"
Dick's face was flushed, too, under
his tan; there was a light in his dark
eyes Nan had never seen there before,
and In an instant she knew his secret;
he had come to tell her that he was
Dick stopped and laid his hands on
her shoulders, compelling her to look
up. "It's neither of them. Nan." he
said. "The only girl I have ever loved
is you, sweetheart. I did not find It
out until you went away, and then I
realized it. Oh, I've been so lonely
without you, dear, so lonely. I>o you
remember you said I ought to have a
composite of those two? Well, you
are that composite; It was always you,
only I- was blind before."
Nan trembled and moved a little
away from him so that the width of
the path was' between them. Then she
looked at the lake b-'dre her with
steady eyes. "Is it Betty or Helen?"
she asked softly. .
"Nan," said Dick, abruptly. "I've
come to tell you something. Tou will
probably think I have acted like a
fool, but you must forgive me, dear
â you always understand and make al
lowances for me. I have decided
â¢whom I love at last"
engaged to Betty or Helen â which?
The color faded from her cheeks.
Dick gave his suitcase to a bellboy and
turned to her again.
"Let us walk down to the lake," he
said quietly. There was a new dig
nity about him that was beautiful in
Nan's eyes.
The shadow of the Dines enfolded
them as they entered the woo-lUini
path. Their footsteps were hushed
In the red-gold pine needles. Through
the dim mysterious vistas of tall tree
trunks gleamed the lake.
Whatever a man says, no matter how
deep, nor how trivial his remark, nor
how much nor how little she under
stands of it. her smile will give him an
answer that will be all satisfying. He
may be talking of pates de fois gras,
or discussing Wagner. He may mere
ly remark that Brown's broiled lobstei
is the best in town. Her smile will
seem to say, "And do you think so,
too!" Or he may declare that "Ibsen
dwells too much in the ether," and
that same smile will say, "How clever
of yoii to put it that way! How per
fectly we understand each other!"
And the man's heart will warm to her.
whether It be a fossil or only a second
ary stomach.
Yet any woman with, a particle of
tact and Intelligence can cultivate the
sympathetic smile. Only the woman
monologist, who has not time to give
her vis-a-vis a show in the conversa
tion, need fail. For the cympathslic
smile is the smile of the listener rather
than of the talker, the smile that says
much and is so useful In the gentle art
of managing a man.
Next to the woman with the sym
pathetic smile a man likes best the girl
with a good, hearty, frank, open smile
â a smile that might be called a laugh
and Is Indeed usually accompanied by
an Irrepressible ripple or gurgle. The
frank smile does not begin in nny one
place; it flashes all over the face at
once. Some Women fattcy that "a
frank smile" means merely parting the
lips and openlng.the eyes wide, so that
all one really observes is a pair of
big eyes and a good set of -teeth. But
a frank smile is a lighting up of the
whole face. This is a smile that can
not be cultivated.
It is the natural spontaneous expres
sion of the girl who is at peace with
all the world. When a man is walking
along hurriedly, with his troubles
weighing down his shoulders and press
ing his forehead into a wrinkle, it is
like a sudden dose of a stimulant to
glance up and meet the glowing eyes
of the girl with a frank smile and to
hear that little bubbling gurgle. The
frank smile has the same effect upon
a man as the raising of his window
shade on a bright sunny winter morn
ing. It is warming and enlivening and
cheering. But it has not the fascina
tion nor the personal significance of the
sympathetic smile.
There is a smile that to some wo ien
is (~s natural as a dinr of a curl.
It is the significant smile, the smile
of the coauette. the smile that comes
with eyes that glance out of the t cor
ners and lips that are only half parted.
Some women are born flirts, and from
the time that they first lure the male
members of the family Into bringing
them taffy and sugar plums on the sly
to the time when they begin to lure
other girls 1 sweethearts away . from
them they understand the full value
of the significant smile. Other women
attempt, by fetching glances of thÂ»
eyes and making a move of the llps^
to cultivate this dangerous smile; but
the trouble with the girl who does this
is that she usually overdoes it. A smile
that is too significant is as disgusting
as tea that is too sweet, or a summer's
There is a certain type of woman
who knows how to smile scientifically.
She is the woman with the sympa
thetic smile, the most fascinating
smile to the masculine mind and
heart; the slow, sweet, hfclf- wistful
smile, the smile that does not flash
upon you all at once, but begins in
the eyes and spreads slowly over the
face; the very personal smile, that is
accompanied by a direct, significant
and searching glance, straight Into
your own eyes. A woman who has
cultivated this smile â for the sympa
thetic smile is invariably cultivated â
can make a fool think himself bril
liant, an old man fancy himself a
devilish boy, don't you know, and a
youngster imagine that he has, at last,
found the woman 'who understands
him. She need not be clever: she need
not even be a good conversationist.
A woman may be a plain, insignifi
cant little thing, but if she understands
the art of smiling, the science of say
ing all she means and a little more,
by the mere parting of her lips and the
flash of her eyes and teeth she will nev
er have to worry about blank spaces on
her dance programme or the fit of
ready-made frocks. The clever girl,
who can keep a whole drawing-room
full of people amused by her witticisms
and her epigrams, may be a social light
in her way, but while she is entertain
ing the catch of the season, who sits
next her at dinner, and while -she Is
earning his intellectual admiration and
keeping him on the qui vive with her
repartee, there are ten chances to one
that there will be a wise, silly little
thin? somewhere across the table-smil
ing her way straight down into his
heart without saying a single word.
Yet the art of smiling does not con
sist in a mere flashing of teeth and
eyes, or in the illusive dancing of a
dimple. The average girl with a
pretty row of white teeth, who works
day and night to keep up a perpetual
smiling, whose lips part on the slight

the pruspect of future power and the
exalted position which some day will

cause of his attractive individuality,
the many amiable personal traits
which lend a peculiar charm to this*
young Prince, the coming ruler of a
great nation.
William, Crown Prince of Germany
and heir to the throne of Prussia, is a
ilender. well-built youth of 21 years.
His features, without being regular,
are pleasant and interesting, especially
to the feminine eye: .his . movements
graceful and well defined, hi3 manner
.prepossessing and cordial, yet dignified
and showing strength of character and
Boyish pranks were . not infrequent
during this period. Once, when -a dis
tinguished visitor had audience with
the Emperor, the Crown Prince ob

ushered into the august presence com
pressed his opera hat and laid it on a
chair in the antechamber. The head
piece was a novelty for the Prince. He
examined the same closely and experi
mented with it to his great satisfac
tion.
' A few days later the Rev. Dr. Dry
ander. Court Chaplain, called to pay
his respects to his- Majesty. He wore
a brand-new stovepipe and deposited
his) shining tile in the antechamber
before going to the audience. Crown
Prince William, who happened to be
near with his younger "brother, -Eltel
Fritz, Immediately started to investi
gate the reverend gentleman's hat and,
remembering the Interesting experl
ence'with the opera hat. tried to com
press the stiff plus in the same man
ner.
The efforts being far from success
ful, he placed the hat back I on the
chair, and assuming the tone of a su
perior officer, commanded* his brother
to sit down on it. The command was
promptly obeyed, and the was
instantaneous and complete, the Court
Chaplain's hat being reduced to the
shape of a pancake.
Of course, the misdeed could not be
hidden, and the reverend gentleman
was rather perplexed when the sad
looking wreck came to his notice. Upon
hearing the story of the experiment,
however, he laughed heartily and In
sisted on keeping the hat as a souv

The course of education and train

Crown Prince especially had a pretty

The lessons, which began at seven

by a light breakfast, consisting of a

After two hours of instruction a more

In April, 1396, fourteen years old.
Prince William was sent to Ploen. tha
"renowned military academy in Hol
steln, where, separate from the ordi
nary cadet school, the "Prinzenschule"
Is maintained, an educational institu
tion intended for the princes of royal
blood. Here he continued his studies
under the tutelage of Professor Ester
naux, an eminent teacher of lan
guages, history and geography, and
Dr. Sachse, instructor* in mathematics.
As "military companions'* were at
tached to his household Colonel von
Pritselwitz and First Lieutenant von
EtuelpnageJ.
The Prince's associates at Ploen.
however, were not at all of an exclu
sive character. It was the desire of
tha Emperor that his heir should not
be isolated, but that he should mingle
with the other cadets, and among his
companions could be found young men
of bourgeois birth as well as those of
ancient lineage. The studies wero
pursued with great assiduity, but at
recess time the Prince enjoyed with
boyish eagerness bicycle riding, sailing
on the beautiful Ploen Lake, horse
back exercises and tennis playing.
Tennis has remained hi3 favoritt
sport up to the present time. He un
derstands the handling of a yacht as
thoroughly as any grizzled old salt,
and to-day he is counted one of the
best and most daring horsemen in the
army. An example of hi3 skill and
fearlessness in the saddle he gave not
loag ago, when he rode at the head of
his company of the guards through
the magnificent park at Potsdam, and.
reaching the celebrated Castle of Sans
Soud, built by his ancestor Frederick
-the Great, he trotted up the high stair
cases stretching down from the palace
in terraces to the park and dismounted
in front of the portal.
This remarkable feat was accom
plished without the slightest hitch with
perfect ease. He then, ordered his
grenadiers to follow him and showed
them through the palace, explaining to
them all the numerous treasures of
historic value that fill the edifice.
While In the pursuit of his studies at
Ploen the strictest kind of discipline
was maintained and festivities of any |
description were absolutely tabooed.
During his sojourn at the academy,
which lasted for nearly four years, it
was the standing order of the Emperor
that no social entertainments should ba
permitted to divert the Prince's atten
tion from his work, and even when on
his departure the city authorities of
that little Holstein tdwn desired to en

The young.man was ever taught that
a Prince must merit the position ha oc

trot never ceasing work and painful
conscientiousness are the essential at
tributes of royalty. This rather severe
method of training and preparation

form the Prince's characer and to fit
him for his important duties. And the
result seems to have Justified tha well

his service started in the "Lelbkom

all princes of the royal blood have been
assigned for generations.
The debut was made at the grand
parade In spring, when the Crown
Prince passed in review with his regi
ment before the Emperor. An inter
ested spectator was the little Princess
WUhelmlna, now Queen of the Nether
lands, who at the time was visiting
the Berlin court with her mother, the
Queen Regent. The young fellow had
a. hard time of it, for the First Foot

and Austrian regiments. He is, fur
thermore, honorary colonel of an Aus
trian regiment of hussars, a distinc
tion conferred on him last spring
while attending the maneuvers in
Hungary in company with hia father.
Having passed through the mili
tary academy, where he graduated
one of the first of his class, the Crown
Prince served a short time with his*'***,
regiment at Potsdam and then entered
the university at Bonn -in the spring
of 1901. His matriculation was per
formed with great ceremony In tha

the attention of Crown Prince William.

The cold hand of fact has brushed
this romance aside, beautiful though
It would seem as a plot for a
novel. In real life events do not run
that way. Fleeting fancies and the en
chantment of the passing hour break
and scatter when they dash against
the firm rock of duty.
The first public reception at which
the Crown Prince officiated was the
New Year's reception of 1899, when he
acted as his father's representative, the
Emperor being 111. Since then he has
been frequently chosen by the Emperor
to represent him at the unveiling of
monuments, or. the dedication of
churches. When the exposition of Dus
eeldorf opened the Crown Prince pre
sided as patron of the enterprise.
.After leaving Ploen Crown Prince
.William made a number. of short trips
for the purpose of inspecting industrial
establishments in Germany. On such
occasions he : traveled incognito as
Count von Ravensberg and was accom
panied by scientific and sociological ex
perts. Later on the Prince took several
extended journeys. He visited the Eng
lish court,- attended the maneuvers in
iable courtesy, frankness and unosten
tatious bearing Â¦ won him' friends and
admirers everywhere.
In the company of ladies the\Prince
has ever been at hia best. Hia lively
interest in feminine . beauty is well
known, arid it has been remarked that
at court balls as .well as private dances
he would manifest the,, most exquisite
taste In the selection of his partners.
CrownJPrince William is a passionate
and most elegant dancer. He acquired
perfection, in this art under the tuition
of the celebrated Mme. Woldefn of Ber

Many a charming trip was under
taken to places in the | vicinity, along
the borders of the Rhine, where the
I-erelel sing* their siren songs, or into
the lovely forests on the mountain side.
On these occasions Prince William, ac
companied by a number of- student
friends, often traveled in very demo
cratic fashion. Once, on the return from
Godesberg, a picturesque town not far
from Bonn, the railroad train was
crowded and all the first-class carriages
were occupied. The depot master was
nearly thrown Into a fit, and his ex
citement and despair were simply be

situation* In his ardor to serve the
Prince he proposed as a measure of

the first-class "compartments cleared

to the excited official:

tirely without foundation hi fact.
An amusing little incidentâ and this

trueâ occurred during . one of the
Prince's numerous bicycle tours In the

the French capital under an assumed
name. After a few days of unalloyed

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALU.

CALIFORNIA
STUDENTS
IN PARISIt is delightful to study the trim
mings of the year and their perusal
administers a wonderful lesson in the
utilization of small things, for some of
the handsomest gowns are made up of
things^which are apparently trifl!og.
The gowns are not fussy by any mean3.
but small trimmings are used upon
them In very effective ways.
One of the pretty notes of the year is
frills of the chiffon will fall over tne
hand, and a frilly, delicate, lacy result
will be obtained.,
A great many of the new spring
sleeves will be sheared off at the elbow.
They will be cut off and finished In
bell shape, quite flaring, with the' edges
finished with little floral applications
and with small frills of lace and with
all sorts of pretty trimmings. This
sort of elbow sleeve will be a feature,
not only of the evening gowns, but of
the gown for day and for street at that.
But the elbow sleeve of 1904 wIlF be
quite different from the elbow sleeve of
1902 and 1903, for it will have its full
lace undersleeve. which will lengthen
the sleeve and bring It down to wrist
length. The undersleeves will be made
of lawn, of lace, of chiffon and of all
kinds of silk, aboundantly trimmed and
made very puffy by the way they are
treated.
And speaking of pu'fflness reminds
one that the new sleeves, while very
full at the wrist, will not be droopy
sleeves. On the contrary they will be
puffed sleeves, with the puffing made
as stiff as possible. Instead of sagging
from the. elbow to the wrist and down
over the hands, the new sleeves will be
wonderfully ballooned and kept In
place by the linings.
So. if yjou have a pair of old-fash
ioned sleeves. >vith baggy, saggy wrist
puffs, just take them and Interline them
with stiff taffeta. Or you can use a
very thin soft quality of crinoline, or,
better still, you can Interline them with
lawn. The puffs must stand out In
melon shape, and there must be noth
ing soft or spiritless about them.
The New Trimming3 of 1904.
If you are the fortunate possessor of
a coat with a very wide bell sleeve, or
with a ben sleeve that is moderately
wide, you are probably, at a loss how to
fill in the bell. True, you can sew lace
In the sleeve, but this is not always
satisfactory, ; as such sleeves are hard
to' get off and on.
Well, here is the newest wrinkle, one
that was started by the leader of New
York society and has been taken up by
the leader of .the London" smart set. '
You put on your* prettiest silk shirt
waist., Then over its ample sleeves you
slip a pair of chiffon undersleeves. You
fasten them at the elbow, very much ab
work girls fasten .on their: oversleeves.
And then , you put on your street coat.
The result will be very satisfactory, for
will throw in a little material." Her
idea was that the sleeve governed the
gown and dominated It and made it
from start to finish. And she is very
nearly right.
In one of Gotham's most fashionable
shops they were selling undersleeves
the other day. The prices ranged from
$5 upward and the sleeves were made
of chiffon and of lace and of deep ruch
ing. They were elbow length and were
of the kind which you slip on over the
hand and pin at the elbow. Trie sleeve
then hangs down fluffy at the wrist.
This counter, which was besieged
with women who were willing to spend
$5 on a pair of undersleeves, was piled
high with sleeves of these sorts. One
sort was made entirely of deep ruching,
all lace, laid in side plaits and trimmed
with rows and rows of lace. When on
the arm they fall and make a very deep
frill Â» round the hands. Another sleeve
was finished with a neat little cuff of
lace at the wrist while the upper part
bagged down\over the hand. And the
third had a cuff with frills falling over
It. All were in creamy white and. tru
ly, any woman supplied with a set of
each would have a perfect treasure in
her wardrobe for all the winter. n
How to Wear the New Sleeve. â¢
, The sleeve auestion is one that does
not go down, for it crops' up again and
again, and always with some, new in
terest. Just now the point of ,' view Is
at the wristi.with a lesser Interest cen
tering In the shoulder. ,
/''Give' me six pairs of fashionable
sleeves," said a modiste, ', "and I will
give you six fa'shlonable bodices if you
terials, rnd .". is so velvety in Jts ..p
pearance that many women are buying
It to use as trimmings upon evening
gowns, instead of the panne velvet,
which costs a great deal more.
It is certainly a year for glossy
stuffs, and the manufacturers are
turning out materials which outrival
anything eveÂ» seen before in point of
luster. And the luster 13 of a kind that
does not wear off. It endures, and
seemingly becomes glossier and glossier
as the garment wears out. To the very
last shred U is as brilliant as glass.
Louisine is found thte year in the
new colors, ar.G It. too, has taken- to
itself a new and wonderful surface, and
the new Louisines are. as one delight
ed modiste declares, a combination of
peaii de sple and satin, a texture of the
former with the gloss of the latter.
And there is another new material,
which is only a new form of an old
material, and this is the dyed lace of
the present year. Dyed laces will play
a very important part In the fashion
able wardrobe, and it will well repay
any woman to investigate them and to
procure as many kinds as she can af
ford. " Y
At a Fifth avenue luncheon the other
day one of the . guests wore a dyed
brown lace shirt whist, just about the
color of breakfast coffee. It was a soft,
deep, rich tone, which harmonized well
with her light brown hair. The na
ture of the lace. was a heavy Imported
lace of the sort once used for. lace cur
tains and. now called "furniture lace."
It; was dyed all over, and the shirt
waist, which was high in the neck and
long in the sleeves, was lined with taf
feta.
There are not so very many taffeta
linings these days, for the material does
not wear so very well, unless one gets
a very cood grade or is very fortunate
in one's selection. But a good taffeta
has great wearing qualities, and, now,
-it is claimed that louisine for a lining
-is the best of all things next to a very
glossy lightweight satin. "
â¢ Many persons are lining shirt waists
and other thin material Â» with a very
i nice quality of cambric, or lawn, or
cotton stuff, and very smart some of
â¢ these gowns are with their crisp, crink
ly cotton linings, in good shades.
The Question of the Sleeve.
The wonderful sheen
and the brilliant colors of
the dresses that will be
worn for evening from
now until the Easter days

markable revivals of trim
mings and small articles
âThe belts that go round
and round the waist, do

front -point.
tor use, for many of the nicest
French importations are made of sub
stantial material. But It can be pretty,
and it must be trimmed with some of
the many little intricacies which make
up so many gowns nowadays.
In these days, when all kinds of trim
mings can be bought, there Is no rea
son why a woman should not have a
very modish dress, and If she be indus
trious* she can have a French gown at
Americaa prices. In the embroidery
stores there come fat little seeds in all
colors, which, when scattered over the
surface of a gown, look Ilka French
knots, and there come the dearest little
lattices in ribbon and In braid, ' which
are ideal for the trimming of yokes
and the covering of stocks.
But it is of the possibilities of the
cloth gown that the faithful fashion
writer must sing, for cloth now comes
so thin as to look like veiling, though
It wears twice as well, and it also
comes >n as many colors as silk and it
can be made up as delicately as any
of the very fine fabrics. It is as glossy
as satin and you do not know it from
the latter material except as you pinch
it in the fingers.
liaising the Line of the Waist.
There is the slightest tendency to
raise the waist line u trifle, and it is
noticeable more upon the gowns of
evening than upon those that are in
tended for the day. Waists that were
formerly drawn down In a very long
and very low point are now finished so
as to look almost round, and blouses
that depended for their style upon the
front curve are now cut off and worn
with a wide, high belt.
The new evening belts are a littla
And there is really no reason why
Â«very woman with social hopes should
not have one handsome evening dress.
It need not , e a decollete, for a great
many of the handsomest gowns are not
cut decollete, and it need not be too
Mysterious many of these seem, with
their marvelous applications, raised
and flat, and with their very curious
embroideries, and their wealth of silk
tassels and their hanging balla and
fringes and queerly arranged Jewel
trimmings. But there Is no woman
who does not admire them, and there
are very few women who do not long
to possess Just such a gown.
; tf every woman, be she old or young,
admires nice gowns, it is nor.e the less
true that every woman has a particular
fancy for the handsome creations that
are to be worn in the ex'enlng.
Such Pretty Evening Waists.
THERE lives do woman in all the
wcrld, be she ever bo quiet or ever
so old, who does not secretly ad
trJre beautiful gowfis, even though
she does not do so outright. She may
declare that her mind Is above fashions
and her body beyond them. But down
:n her heart of hearts she loves to purr
over soft velvets, and in her soul of
souls she admires the sheen of the sat
ins and the glare of the Eilks. It Is in
born In a gentlewoman, and only a Fiji
Islander is free from it.
And the woman who admires the
fashions this winter may be excused
for her preferences. The new cloths are
so lustrous that they look precisely like
satin. And, indeed, there is a new
broadcloth which not only looks like
satin when new, but which keeps Its
gloss when it is old and which is so
lustrous that not even a sponging will
take off its sheen.
And how satisfactory it is to be able
to buy a brilliantly beautiful cloth
gown and to have it keep Its brilliancy,
to have it preserve its color, its texture
and even its very surface, no matter
what happens to it.
A "Washington woman who goes a
great deal to the diplomatic receptions
ordered a gown of cloth the color of
â¢ cream of milk. It was to be made In
1904 fashion, which is a two-piece suit.
The upper part was to be in shirtwaist
shape, while the lower part was to be
a sweep EkJrt for evening wear. The
whole was to be trimmed with flower
embroidery, and in this respect the
woman gave her modiste carte blanche.
The gown came home simply gor
geous. Upon the exquisitely glossy
Moth skirt there were embroidered
lovely little white flowers, all carried
out In a very narrow lacy braid. Over
this skirt hung -one of tissue, and upon
this there were long sprays of small
procn leaves. The waist matched the
skirt. Its sleeves were short and there
were chiffon puffs below.
This woman, who has few gowns,
Â¦will, after she has worn the dress half
a dozen times, remove the tissue outer
part, and then she will have a gown
of pure cream cloth trimmed with small
lacy white flowers.
Woman cannot complain of monotony
in materials, for these are as numerous
as the styles. In the first stuffs of the
new 'year "there Is noticed a hew, kind
of panne silk, which Is -'so*; exceedingly
lustrous that it looks like panne velvet.
This silk has a sheen such as * was
never seen before upon the; panne ma-
to blame for the shortening of tne
waist, for they are so very wide and so
very effective. They, are made of
leather, of panne, of silk and of ribbon,
and they are wide and are fastened in
the back with a buckle. That Is one
style. But there are others.
,/Mlss Alice Roosevelt wore a wide
white leather belt the other evening,
with a white taffeta dress. The belt
was made of suede, very thin and very
crushable. It was laid around the waist
In many folds and the front was fast
ened with three white leather thongs
and a white leather covered buckle.
An evening waist of light brown laca
was caught at the belt by a crush
girdle of panne silk, which was pulled
down low in the front and drawn out
broad, so that it made a very wide or
nament for the waist. This was fast
ened invisibly with hooks and eyes,
without a buckle.
Those who are slender enough can
take this wide crush belt and clasp it
round and round the waist with a
great buckle, which comes in front.
Tall and slender girls affect this style,
and are the envy of their stout sisters,
and so do women who are short but not
too stout. The Btout woman must be
careful to keep her waist line low, but
the slender woman can revel in the new
high waist line, which is a revival of
â¢the waist of ten years ago.
And what a year it is for revivals!
No sooner does one get accustomed to
the long pointed waist, with its high
back and its dipping front; than along
comes the wide round-and-round belt,
which is precisely, the one mother wore
in 18S0 and 1890.
The Lovely New Materials.
There is something to be said, too.
for the ribbon rose which Is used to
fasten many a belt. It is a little round,
fat rose and is seen not only at its sta
tion, at the front of the belt, but it
is used to fasten the front of many a
low necked bodice. Made of glossy vel
vet ct of shining satin and finished
with a little jewel In the middle. It is
a very nice ornament for any gown.
A few of the ribbon roses are sewed
with pearls as though they were rain
drops. Others have a small '->weled
button in the middle to simulate the
heart of the flower. Made In this way
or made In that, the rose is pretty.
And these are but a few of the things
that are offered for woman's beautlflca
tion. And as spring comes on more
and more beauties will be disclosed.
About the buckles too much can
never be said. They are such marvel
ous things as to be really works of art,
and their workmanship, as well as
their materials, place them on a level
with any Jewel in one's Jewel box.
The subject of belts has not been
completely exhaust 1 by the statement
that belts are growing wider, for some
of the new gowns seem* to show that
they are growing a great deal nar
rower. A very handsome evening gown
was trimmed with very narrow claret
red velvet. It was worn with a. belt
which Â¦v as made of claret-red panne,
cut very narrow and crossed in the
middle of the front under a garnet
buckle. It very frequently happens that
some of the handsomest evening gowns
are worn with very narrow belts, and
these are brought around the waist and
crossed very low In the middle of the
front In such a way as to leave two
arrow points, while over the points
there is pinned a jeweled buckle.
Final Word on Small Things.
sounded in the bringing out of very
narrow but very nice laces threaded
with ribbon. Ribbon, very narrow, la
run through the edge of the lace, just
as one threads one's underwear with,
ribbon, and lace Is used for the trim
ming of an evening gown, or a day
dress.
And It seems to make very little dif
ference how this threaded lace Is used,
for upon one evening bodice there was
a little lace around the low neck, ard
through this lace there was threaded
a very narrow black velvet ribbon.
Upon another a little lace, drawn full
of ribbons, was used for a yoke.
A very effective street dress had a
hip yoke of ecru lace which came down
to a long, low point upon the front of
the skirt. And all around the edge of
the lace there was run a narrow black
velvet ribbon, making a very neat and
very sharp contrast.
Very narrow pieces of Insertion, some
of them no more than half an inch
or a quarter of an Inch wide, axe
threaded with black velvet or with
royal blue velvet, or with berry-colored
ribbon, and used to head flounces and
to band the puffings with which so
many skirts are trimmed.
There are many new trimmings,
made of plcot edge braid and of all
sorts of fancy braids, and these, if don
delicately, have all the lacy appear
ance of fine lace. Irish lace, American
lace and many of the imported laces
can really be simulated by these laces,
which are made of the narrow braids.
And here it is that the woman w:th
deft fingers comes out very strong, for
she can do so very much with her
needle and thread, or with her crochet
hook and her fine linen.

THIS hurrying age presents con
stantly the spectacle of multi
tudes of overbusy, overworked
men and women. Most Amer

blood or In the atmosphere, or in both,
want to do something, and usually
something worth while. Moreover of
late, distinguished leaders in various
departments of thought and action,
from our strenuous President down,
have exhorted us to redeem the time.
Huch counsel from such sources has
borne, is beaming fruit.
But the American tendency also is
toward extremes, and so it comes about
that the world to-day is full of people
Â¦who have undertaken a little more
than they can effectively accomplish.
They are so busy all the time that when
they are politely asked to pay this so
cial call, to assume that responsibility
in the church, to show up at the cau
cus, to lend a hand in pushing some
worthy but struggling enterprise, their
excuse uniformly is "too busy." And

for the letter and the sender of It.
No man has a right to be so busy
as to fail to cherish a helpful interest
in somebody else. Most Americans
look well to their families and surely
their first obligation is to them. But
one's affections and sympathies ought
.not to ' stop there. There are often
homes less well provided than yours
Â¦with the comforts of existence. Get
an interest in some black lad in a
school in the South, or in some street
gamin who occasionally frequents a
boys' club or a social settlement. If
every busy man, if every business man
should become warmly, persistently
interested in some one needy person,
how much faster this old world would
go on.
Once more: No man ought to be so
busy as to neglect* the culture of his
soul. This phrase may sound like cant

THE PARSON.
Now there are certain righteous lim
itations to the various buslnessefe which
a man may undertake. â¢ In the first
place, he has no right to be so busy as
to ignore or trifle with the little cour
tesies of life. When a man is so ab
sorbed In his own scheme that he can
not utter a cheery good-morning to the
family and to every member of it,
when he is 6O wrapped up in his buy
ing and selling or in his professional
problem that he never stops to say
"thank you," when even a social infe
rior renders him a personal service â
why, that man is altogether too busy.
He ought at ouce to begin to rearrange
his programme with a view to making
room for the small but indispensable
civilities to human intercourse.

I ventured to outline a new line of busi

his oration. Instead of proceeding with
ills speech In the usual order I sug
gested that there was in Rome In those
days a condition of things not entirely
dissimilar to that existing in California
mining camps during election times.
Caesar had been killed. Brutus with
his high character and mighty, elo
quence has justified the homicide and
pacified the people. Feellnsr perfectly
safe arid disdaining opposition Brutus
consented that Mark Antony might
speak in defense of Caesar, and did
not consider Mark of sufficient conse

Mark Antony mounts . the forum. He
is recognized as a friend of Catsarand
an opponent of the noble Brutus and
with murmurs of dissent this populace
commenced to move away. "Friends,"
says- Antony, and they heed him not.
"Romans," he cries, and they continue
to depart. "Countrymen, lend me your

leave. ' Then he launches his final ad

lose his audience and he shouts, "I
come to bury Caesar not to praise" him."

play "Richelieu" at Baldwin's Theater.
The house -ivas packed with the elite of
San Francisco, and I.was called before
the curtain at flic close of every act.
But it did net fool me. I attributed the
large audience to curiosity ind the ap
plause fo generosity, and I declined to
repeat the performance.
James O'Neil said tome after the
curtain fell, "Do you know that in your
action it the close of the fourth act

you think that it was undignified for a
Cardinal to wall; down the stage, and
that it would be more effective to do
your cursing at long range?" V
"Jimmy," said I, "I know all _about
the stage business. The; trouble was
with my pantaloons. I removed my vest
and coat in the dressing-room and put
on the Cardinal's, robe, which covered
me from neck to feet. I wore no sus
penders, and when I delivered the curse
of Rome the strap of my pantaloons
burst and they fell about my ankles.
I had to stand just there where they,
fell. If 1 had attempted to go down
front I had either to step out of my
pantaloons or drag them trailing after
me. Now it would not have looked well
for a Lord Cardinal to leave his

an old-fashioned- country dance, the
bridegroom, a precocious boy of 10,
bade farewell .to his bride. "I go,"
said he, "as was agreed between us at

THE MERCHANT
WHO BEEFED
INCESSANTLY
(Copyright, 190.?, by Steve Floyd, N. Y.)
ik j . fp-i yrF. upon a time there lived in the town
|]?>^s^>c;J of Nellisville a main named Remus Bres-
5in ' Hc ran a druR store . and carried' a
i *MPÂ©"*rB Iul1 Jinc of school books, fishing
i '/je^^?#Ai tackle, garden seed and toysâ when
P- ' yVffi!28% * they were in season,
1JÂ£'Â»4'' Â¦Â¦ - â rji *Â¦! Remus was a natural born beefer. He
kicked incessantly. "V
If.hc was shy a suitable excuse for setting up a howl
he would vamp one. If trade was a shade slack he would
growl shamefully. If business was brisk he would go
over the- books, after the rush was over, until he could
iind that; on that same day way back in the year so and
so, he took in about six bits more, then he would make
for home and tell his wife if she did not ease up on the
household expenses he would not be able to keep his
head above water. . %
If there was no sickness in-town Remus would raise
Hail Columbia because there were no more old-fashioned
diseases. If- an epidemic struck ' Nellisville he would
stack up a full-sized groan to the effect that there was no
profit in the pesky, new-fashioned prescriptions written
by young Doc Tetter. , . .,â¢,.'-Â¦.' - -â¢ j-
If the weather was bad Remus. would fret himself into
a fever because the farmers coujd not get,. away 'from
home to invest in pills, porous plasters and. the -like. If
the weather .-was .at par he would grumble, because the
agriculturists stayed at home to tend their crops.
Every morning as soon as Remus reached his store
he would grab the city paper and scrutinize the market
reports just as if they were the making of the breaking
of him. If cotton was up 10 points he would count the
cash in the drawer., look suspiciously at his clerk and
wonder why more had not come across the counter. If
middlings were down 2 points he would, tip' the clerk off
to go light on the soft coal, no matter. what the thermom
eter had to say about the weather.
When the consolation round of the calendar was
reached and the Young Americans began" to mail their
annual instructions to Santa Claus, Remus got out the
catalogue and made up his order for holiday goods,
which consisted of dolls with moving eyes, flowing curls
and sawdust inwards, steam cars with clock machinery,
"Remember Me" and "Forget-Me-Not" cups and sau
cers, fish and ducks with magnets in glass top boxes,
Christmas cards with snow-covered barns and windmills
on them, plush bound photograph albums, Roman can
dles, Noah arks, firecrackers and the like. The whole
caboodle footed up to fifty simoleons.
Remus touched his little iron safe for the full amount
and inclosed it with his order. Then he looked in the
back of the almanac to see what the state of the weather
would be on the 24th inst. The dope said "Fair; fresh,
southwest to west winds, turning to snow and followed
by. clearing and colder." Remus was skeptical. For all
that he knew the prognosticator was not at his best
when he made his calculations.
Anyhow, he was fifty to the bad, for the mail had
none to the station and he was in an awful frame of mind.

NEW FABLE
FOR THE
FOOLISH
If breakage was light and the weather half way decent
there was a fighting chance for him to .break even. But
if the cards ran the other way he would be ruined for life.
In due timeâ on the morning of the 23d, to be exact â
the goods arrived. The news spread over Nellisvillc like
wildfire. Excitement was intense. All the kids at school
began to have toothache, hendache or some other excuse
for getting out at once, and the grown-ups took on a
solemn countenance and dropped in to get a glance at
the passel of tomfoolery.
Remus and his clerk peeled the straw off the play
things, got covered with dust, sneezed as if they hail the
hay fever, priced each item and put it on top of the show
case. Then the store was swept out. the music box
wound up and Remus went to the back door to sec the
sun set and get a line on the weather of the morrow. He
was visibly agitated.
Several persons had picked out what they wanted and
had it set aside. But there was a chance that they would
change their mind over night, just as Josh Pendleton had
done Christmas before last after selecting a salad dish
and two napkin rings.
Before the store closed for the day Remus threw a
bucket of water into the stove to make sure against loss
by fire, then he went home and removed the spots from
his black suit with ammonia, so that he would be spick
and span enough to wait on the ladies the next day.
When the clock struck 9 Remus put the cat out and
went to bed. All during the night he rolled and tossed
restlessly. His wife stroked his fevered brow and whis
pered words of encouragement. But he could not be
quieted.
Promptly at 6 on the morning of the 24th the alarm
went off. Remus jumped out of bed and dressed. After
getting on the outside of some fried sirloin and a cup of
mocha, which he drank from the saucer, for he could
not wait for it to cool, he took it on a run to his store.
The only sign of life without was a pile of burning
trash in front of the General Store across the way. Fog
hung thick and filled the air with gloom; children were
still asleep: dogs barked; roosters crowed and cows
lowed dolefully. Remus paced the floor impatiently. He
felt that he was up against it. Never before had he seen
trade so late in starting up on a Christmas eye.
Along about 9 o'clock the first native came in and be
gan to trade. He was followed by others, and before
the whistle blew for 12 the store was jammed. Men jin
gled money, women jabbered, wax dolls cried, wooden
sheep bleated, the clerk raked in the mazuma with both
hands and Remus made courtesies to everybody.
In the afternoon business became so swift that Remus
had to send for his wife to help wait on the customers.
As early as 2 o'clock prices were heartlessly boosted and
the stock had to be spread out thin to make a respectable
showing. At 5 everything had been sold except a 90-ccnt
vase which- was cracked across its flowered side.
When Remus counted up for the day and found that
he was only $197 25 to the good he turned to his clerk
and said, "Why in the world didn't you sell that vase to
one of your friends?"
Moral: The whole is not half enough for the average

Continued From Page Four.
way from Fusan, the Japanese foot
hold on the peninsula, to Seoul, the
capital, a distance of about 200 miles.
The strategic advantages of this rail
road, once completed, to the Japanese
would be enormous. By means of. it
even should Russia sweep the seas.
Which is extremely unlikely, Japan
could yet maintain an army In North
ern Korea, the island studded straits
between the peninsula and Japan be
ing rather narrow and difficult of navi
gation.
Probably all the navies of the East
would fail to maintain an effective
blockade here. But unfortunately for
Japan the railway is still on paper,
with but one complete section of
twenty-five miles in operation. The
project, however laudable from a
patriotic point of view, did not appeal
to the Japanese investor, who can put
his savings in railways near . â¢ home
which pay anywhere from 10 to 20
per cent The work of construction
advanced by inches and only at this
li_'. s day the imperial Government has
been authorized by the Diet to take
over the railway and push it Jo' a
speedy conclusion. But the differ
ences between Russia and Japan will
probably have been settled before it
will be necessary to take this extreme
ly important railway into considera
tion as a factor in the same of war.
In conclusion it may be said that
Korea is about as large as the Empire
State and that its position on the East
Asian, map closely resembles that of
Florida on our own coast. Had, in
deed, Florida remained in the,posses
sion of Spain and Spain remained a
great power our position in the matter
would have been very much the same
as that of the Russian Government is
in regard to a Korea in Japanese pos
session or under her political influence.
The strategic railways between Port
Arthur, on the. Liaotong, and Vladivo
stok, on .Peter . the Great's Buy, must
pass within" a few miles of the north
ern frontier of Korea, and they would
be constantly exposed to destruction
at the critical moments when their
maintenance would be of vital import
ance to Russian dominion in the Far
East.'
Again, -with Japan strongly fortified
on the south coast of Korea, at Ma-
sampho or elsewhere, communication
by water between the two great bul
warks of Russian power and dominion
in the Far, East, which I have already
mentioned, would be extremely pre-
Here we have the elements of the
irreconcilable quarrel, and yet the
bloody phase, the trial of strength by
battle, may be postponed. Russia can
wait better than any other power In
th. world. All her great victories
have been won by waiting. One thing,
however* is quite certain â the finances
of Japan will not permit of her keep
ing up her present very effective
armament by sea ~nd land. It would
have been better for Japan to have
fought last year than this; better this
year than the next.
A postponement of the conflict .may
be secured by. Russia permitting ; the
occupation of Korea by Japanese
forces to maintain law and order in
the kingdom, which is fast lapsing;
into anarchy.- Public opinion in Japan
"would be appeased, and in the/mean
time Russia would consolidate , her
power in Manchuria, . in the Llaotong
Peninsula and in Eastern Siberia, and
await, her opportunityâ which could
not fail to be more favorable than the
.presentâ of driving Japan out of
Korea. She compelled the withdrawal
of Japan from the Liaotong by diplom
acy and ' by putting 'her/ fleet in war

(See List of Prizes.)MOTHER AND WIFE OF THE CZAR OF RUSSIA "WHO WOULD DI
RECT HIS POLITICAL. DESTINY AND THE WOMAN WHO IS
STRIVING FOR HIS DOWNFALL. . .
Since the day he ascended the throne
there has been a continuous contest
between his wife ar.d his mother for
supremacy over the Czar. His mother,
the Dowager Empress, though brought
up at the most democratic court in
Europe â that of Denmarkâ became
after her marriage to Alexander III as
Muscovite in thought and opinion as
the most extreme Russian Conserv
atives. A Protestant by birth and edu
cation, she became a devout adherent
of the orthodox Greek faith.
When her son. Nicholas II, then a
young man of "6, became Emperor, his
mother formed a resolve that she would
guide him in the footsteps of his
fathers and protect him from the mod
ernizing influences of the age. The
Dowager Empress has been the lead
ing spirit of the reactionists at the
Russian court. She has sought to make
her eon a ruler after her own heart, a
statesman of the Muscovite school, a
The truth is that the Czar Nicholas II
is physically weak, with shattered
nerves, and without much will of his
own. He is an amiable young man and
well-meaning: enough, but he is abso
lutely unfitted to be the autocratic
ruler of a country like Russia, where
an iron-handed administrator is essen
tial.
ET. PETERSBURG. Jan. 23.â One of
tbm permanent puzzles of the present
Cear's reign has been the remarkable
inconsistency with which Nicholas II
has conducted the Government of his
empire. AVhen he ascended the throne
he had the reputation of being a keen
reformer, yet he retained the most
reactionary of his father's Ministers in
cfSce. Since then he has alternated be
tween progressive and retrogressive
tendencies.

militarist, and an upholder of the Rus
sian bureaucracy, which is the Czar's
most potent instrument in ruling per-
ponally over so many millions of sub
jects distributed. over two continents.
The Csar's wife," on the coijtrary, is
the embodiment of open-minded liber
alism. Her Anglo-German mind cannot
grasp the medieval ideal which 'ap-
peal so strongly to the Slavs, with
their lower degree of culture, civiliza
tion and ', enlightenment. Necessity
compelled her to embrace the orthodox
Greek faith when she married Nicho
las, but her conversion was purely for
mal, and she remains at heart true to
Lutheran Presbyterianism, the religion
of her childhood. In politics, too, the
Asiatic ideas which prevail at the Rus
sian court are abhorrent to her, and she
regards the reactionary advisers of the
Czar, Including her own mother-in-law,
as the worst enemies of Russia.' '""

. CZARINA IS PROGRESSIVE.
All the influence the Czarina pos
sesses over her Imperial husband is ex
erted to make him a progressive west
ern monarch instead of an eastern po-
ten tate glorying in Asiatic -conditions
of semi-barbarism. She has pleaded
repeatedly, for malcontent students
who . have cot into trouble * by demon
strating their political opinions too vig
orously; she has espoused the cause. of
strikers; she has championed the rights
of . the Jews, who can be baited wiih
impunity throughout Russia; she has
represented to her husband the injus
tice of suppressing Polish nationalism
by* blbod-and-iron .methods, and .she
has , warmly advocted a more merciful
treatment* of the liberty-loving, patri
otic Finns. . '.
Needless to say, during the nine years
of the Czar's reign, the Czarina and
her mother-in-law have come into
sharp collision over political affairs on
numerous occasions.
The Czar wavers continuously be
tween allegiance to his wife and to his
mother. He loves his wife, but he fears
his mother, and it is a constant strug
gle between love and fear.. Sometimes
the one gets the upper hand, sometimes
the other c hence the I zigzag course of
the Czar's policy visible to the world.
It is a matter of common gossip In
Russian court circles that the two im
perial ladies from time to time have
lively passages rf arms over their di
vergent political views. Shortly after
the recent Kishenev -riots, when so
many Jews were massacred, there was
quite a scene between the Dowager
Empress and her daughter-in-law in
the , Czar/s study Â¦ one morning. The
Czarina urged that the Kishenev mas
sacres disgraced Russia in the eyes of
The Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna,
the wlfe\of the Czar's uncle and heir
presumptive. Grand Duke Vladimir,
is the most formidable and most dan
gerous of the women who exercise
political influence on the Russian Em
peror. This ambitious woman covets
the throne of Russia for her husband
and for her son and her whole career
has been devoted to the task of under
mining the present Czar's position.
Whenever she can contribute to the
accomplishment of something: likely to
weaken the Czar's position she exerts
her whole strength to bring it about.
She has sought to make the Czar ridi
culous in the eyes of the nobility and
to represent him in an unfavorable
light to the masses of the Russian
people. Her influence Is exercised most
ly V indirectly, throuch her husband,
whose position as next in line to the
throne after the Czar's rather sickly
younger brother makes him a person
age of great power and importance.
The Grand Duchess also operates
through members of a court clique,
which is ill-disposed toward Nicholas
II. and through newspapers which are
in receipt of subventions from her.
She is by far the cleverest of the
women around the Czar and had her

her husband's honor, while the Dow
ager Empress maintained that no one
whose opinion was worthy of consid
eration cared whether there were a
few Jews more or "less in the world
and that the protests made in western
countries were engineered by an In
significant minority of uninfluential

a grand entertainment to be given in
the near future. As soon as the council

vorably commented upon by the grand

nity of its members during the con

GOSSIP CONCERNING
PERSONS AND THINGS
,. . ; KNOWN IN STAGELAXD
Dave Warfield is perhaps the only
idle actor In America whose idleness is
not compulsory. He closed his season
in "The Auctioneer" while the piece
'was attracting crowded houses and ex
plained that the abrupt ending of his
tour was due to the proceedings
brought by Joseph Brooks against Da
vid Belasco, which ended in the ap
pointment of a receiver for the suc
cessful play. As Mr. Warfleld refuses to
play any longer in the piece no re
ceiver will be necessary.
Brooks averred that he was a part
ner in "The Auctioneer," and Belasco
alleged that Brooks was not a part
ner in any sense, but that he was the
dummy of Klaw & Erlanger, to
whom, Belasco says, he had to give a
half interest In "The Auctioneer" in
order to have It booked by the syndi
cate agency. Mr. Warfleld has Issued
this explanation of his position:
"When I stated I would not play un
der the management of any one but
Mr. Belaeco I meant just what I said.
It was not a threatâ simply my honest
conviction as to what was just and due
to the man who has made me a suc
cessful star. 'The Auctioneer! was Mr.
Belasco's own investment, every penny
of it. It was he who conceived the
idea of starring me in a play of this
character. From this man Brooks I
have received nothing, nor have I from
Klaw & Erlanger, who are Mr. Be
lasco's partners in 'The Auctioneer.'
"The manner in which they became
partners will be shown and proved
when this case comes into cdurt for
trial. They refused to give Mr. Belasco
bookings until he had surrendered 50
per cent of the concern. I was an un
made star then, and Mr. Belasco was
not In the position of power which he
holds to-day. We had to divide.
"But of the profits which Klaw &
Erlanger have made from the man
agers with whom they have booked the
attraction, neither Mr. Belasco nor I
have received one penny from our
partners. < As for Brooks, he has never
had even! carfare from our end, unless
Klaw & Erlanger have been more lib
eral to him than to us.
"The trouble and annoyance which
th!s whole affair has caused me have
made me 111. But, sick or well, I abso
lutely refuse to play in 'The Auction
eer' for" any one but my "own manager,
David Belasco. I defy Erlanger, as he
hopes to emerge unscathed from some
of his own Western troubles, to deny
that he and Klaw and not Brooks, are
the real- partners of Belasco in my tour.
"He told me so with his own lips,
when the New Amsterdam Theater
was building last summer. He asked
me to come and see how the founda
tions were getting on. And when I
funked, before crossing a rather rick
ety-looking plank, he said, 'I won't let
you get hurt, old man. Remember, I
own CO per cent of you.' When Klaw &
Erlanger hand over our share of the
profits they have made on the side,
through booking my play, I will go on
with the tour if my health permits." Â¦
ACTOR DAVID WARFIELD
VOLUNTARILY CLOSES
A PROFITABLE SEASON
"That's easy. Comic opera is as
much in demand as it ever was, but -it
looks as if the librettists and composers
are played out. The field remains open,
but the goods are not delivered. All the
recent failures of comic opera were due
la the poor quality of the lines or the
music or both. There are no modern
Gilberts and Eullivans or Smiths and
De Kovens. The breed seems to be ex
tinct, and its p!ace has gradually been
taken by a race of Webers and Fields.
Look at 'Lady Mollie.' for instance. No
comic opera was ever so lavishly
staged or so intrinsically worthless, un
less it was 'The Fisher Maiden.' Both
pieces were started out at the begin
ning of this season, and both died early
and of the same disease â debility of
the book. The music wasn't so bad,
but the librettos were awful. I was in
the cast of 'The Fisher Maiden,* book

York Journalist, and score by Harry
Van Tilzer. Charlie Candee, who now
swings the baton over Fischer's or

the music was all right. But the book

"When away from the shop I hate
to talk shop, except to newspaper men,
who are likely to publish what I say.
Oh. you needn't try to conceal your
surprise. Of course I like to be noticed
by the newspapers. Why shouldn't I?
Attention from the press is eagerly
welcomed by every person In my pro
fession, although some of them are
snobbish enough to profess aversion
to it. Advertising is the life of the
theater. I know that and you know
thstâ and we agreed to be candid." .
"So we did. And in the line of candor
I want you to explain why comic opera
is giving way to musical comedy and
extravaganza."
Nor was she. Her strong, reposeful
face was entirely guiltless of powder,
and her hair, parted in the middle and
lying flat, awakened memory of Mr.
Gillette as the Private Secretary. A
plain white shirtwaist and a skirt of
rough woolen material enveloped her
buxom figure.
"So without flying very wide of the
mark, you can describe me as late 30
or early 40 â never mind saying any
thing about fat and fairâ and you
might add that I feel about 16. Now
let us proceed to less interesting mat
ters. What shall it be. your glorious
climate or the stage?"
"The stage, by all means."
"Of course I'm not going to state how
long I have been on earth, because
your readers would rot believe any
statement of that kind I might utter.
You may tell them, however, that I am
no pulletâ that my son hes passed his
eighteenth birthday and my daughter
is close up to 16. If you want to do
any calculation on your own account
you mav look at me and guess. But
remember, I'm not made up for critical
inspection."

"That depends upon the gentlemen
who are providing musical comedy. If
their rivalry continues to lead to the
extravagance of production that caused
so many failures this season, they will
soon tire of the game, pool their is
sues and establish a common policy of
economic expenditure, just as the dra
matic and vaudeville syndicates have
done. Next season there is likely to
â¢ be fewer and less expensive musical
comedies started on tour than was the
case this season, and consequently
there will be less work for performers
and a better prospect of steady em
ployment for those who are engaged."
"How do you like the Tivoll?"
"The audiences are generous and. the
company lovely. Most of my stage
companions are old acquaintances.
Would you believe that Ferris Hart
man coached me in the first comic
opera part. I ever attempted? It was
In Duluth, while the Hanlan-Courtney
boat race was in preparation, and the
town was jammed with visitors. We
got up a performance of 'The Mikado,'
and Ferris managed the stage and
played Koko. I was cast for Pitti-
Slng."
"The Hanlan-Courtney race took
place in the year eighteen eighty"â
"Goodness gracious! Can't we get
along without resurrecting the prob

JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
"To the fact that the musical comedy,
musical farce nnd musical burlesque
are giving the very features that made
vaudeville so attracthe a decade ago.
In the musical comedy you get all sorts
of 'specialties,' and they are equipped
with scenic and choral and orchestral
accessories that the regular vaudeville
house does not and probably cannot
present."
"So you believe that musical comedy
will wax as vaudeville wanes?"
nasts and the Jugglers were the only
performers."
"To what do juu OBÂ»"lbe this going
backward?"
"Right you are. Harry Bulger is now
the leading comedian In 'Mother Goose'
in New York, and Sherry Mathews is
an incurable paralytic in an Eastern
sanitarium. After leaving San Fran
cisco he married Norma Whalleyâ you
remember the statuesque Norma, of
courseâ and now she is in London and
suing for a divorce. If lynching were
legal, and Norma â but please omit that,
even if we are candid."
"Too lateâ an agreement is an agree
ment, you know."
"Well, I didn't say all I was going to
say, anyhow. But I guess it's safer to
talk about one's self than to discuss
other people. Let's stick to strict auto
biography."
"You married Mr. Tannehlll "
"Yes, Ed Tannehlllâ not old Frank.
For gracious sake, don't confound me,
as so many newspaper men have done,
with old Mrs. Frank. After the death
of Mr. Tannehill there was a long pe
riod of widowhood and then I became
the wife of â well, never mind his name.
He la not an actor, and he is at the
head of my home In New York. That's
all 1 can think of about myself that
would be at all Interesting to the folk
you are going to write for."
"Then we'll go back to the stage.
What is the future of vaudeville?"
"That can only be answered by the
opulent and clever gentlemen who are
conducting the destinies of vaudeville
in America. Its what they devise, and
not what the public demands, that the
public will get. I don't know what the
conditions are in this part of the coun
try, but in the East there has been a
gradual change in the general make-up
of the vaudeville show from what it
was five years ago. Good actsâ that Is,
genuine vaudeville turnsâ are scarcer
than they used to be, because the per
formers can do better In Europe. And
there is also an evident elimination of
the short dramatic sketch that had such
vogue not long ago. It looks to me as
if vaudeville is going back to where it
sprang from, the old time variety show
that society did not flock to patronize
and in which the knock-about team,
the serio-comic singer, the innumerable
dialecticians, the acrobats, the gym-
"Oh, it will come, all right, and I'm
on the lookout for it. . But that it is
not likely to come for another twelve
month, at least, is one of the comfort
ins: reflections I derive from looking at
my contract with the Tivoll manage
ment. Mr. Leahy seems to be rather a
shrewd person, and if he saw a pos
sibility of my becoming senile within
fifty-two weeks he would not have en
gaged me for that period at a salary
suggested by myself."
"So you have been on the stage since
you were 7 years of age?"
"I thought we had disposed of the
question of my age, but if you are ang
ling for autobiography I can fill all the
blank pages of your notebook with it.
Or shall I make it brief?"
"To quote the dominant phrase of a
play now running to large and bewil
dered audiences, 'it's up to you. 1 '.'
"I don't know v.hat drama you allude
to, but here's the summarized story of
my life: Began theater work as an
infant phenomenon in the city of St.
Louis and have been at it Â£vcry season
ever since. Went to Colorado with my
parents In 1876 and played child and
Ingenue with Nick Forrester's stock
company in Denver and the mining
camps until I became big and old
enough to personate grown-ups, and
then I commenced what might be
termed my real professional career.
Played under the management of Rich
& Harris in 'Evangeline,' was with
Hoyt & Thomas in their farce comedies
a number of seasons, and for the last
ten years or so have been identified
with as many enterprises. Was here
three years ago with Dunne & Ryley's
comedians when they played the Hoyt
pieces at the California Theater for
three monthsâ"

does not like me, and then I'll be with
you as long as I live."
"May the hint never come."
"Do you mean Patti?"
"I mean any one who Is a hasbeen.
Of all the women who have achieved
distinction behind the footlights there
is only one I can now think of who
showed good sense. That is Lotta. She
is the wisest of them all, for she
stopped work before she became stale
and still has the world guessing as to
whether ehe is yet able to compel Its
handclaps. She retired while the world
was at her feet, and she is remem
bered only as a great artist Such re
membrance is worth winning, even at
the sacrifice of deserting the stage. I
love the stage â have been on It since
I was 7 years oldâ but just as soon as
I see the first symptom of the public
tiring of me, or even lessening Its de
mand for my services. I shall go home
and stay there. Thank heaven, I have
a home to go to, although it may not
be as luxurious an establishment as
eome of those which have been aban
doned by tfcelr avaricious chatelaines.
A good husband and a pair of the dear
est children on earth are constantly so
liciting me to stay at home all the year
'round, but I say to them, 'Just wait.
"And the applause of that certain
class was prompted by pity instead of
admiration. Now, there's another thing
I want to talk about â this thing, of
clinging to the stage after you have
lost your artistic attractiveness."
"Please let It go at that. Do you
mean to say that Pauline Hall, for in
stance, made as big a hit in vaudeville
as did the acrobats or the trained dogs
or the knockabout comedians?"
"With a certain class she did."
"But other women have stepped out
of comic opera into vaudeville and
won plaudits."
"How many of them?"
"Well, there's Jessie Bartlett Davis
and Camille D'Arville and Pauline Hall
and "
"No; candor. I honestly believe that
no sane manager of vaudeville would
offer me stage-room if he knew what
I know. Put me on any stage with a
bunch of good people and I'll make
good In any character comedy part, but
set me up before an audience and ex
pect me todo an acceptable "single turn*
for fifteen or twenty minutes and you'll
soon *nd yourself provoked to throw
things at me. No, sir; no vaudeville
for me. The educated pig or the elastic
limbed lady would make me look like
thirty cents in comparison."
"Nonsense!"
"Too lazy â that is, for vaudeville as
it is operated on the Eastern circuits,
where each house gives two or three
shows a day. Gracious knows I find
it toil enough to don the makeup once
a day. Two matinees a week is a great
trial to me. And here is another con
fession â we're still candid â that you
may make public: I don't think I'm
clever enough to succeed in vaudeville!"
"Never. I have had several enticing
offers to appear as a 'headliner,' but
rejected them."
"You considered vaudeville beneath
your art?"
"Not on your life. No such consider

candid, "you know â I'm too lazy for
vaudeville."
"Too lazy?"
only essentials to operatic success now
adays?"
"Ko, siree. The American people are
not uproarious sticklers for cleverness
of plot, intricacy of situations or bril
liancy of dialogue, but they do insist on
having something intelligible in those
lines. In other words, you can't make
a comic opera out of scenery, costumes
and music. In so-called musical
comedy the public is less exacting, be
cause so-called musical comedy is sim
ply connected vaudeville, and some
times the connection is not very close.
In a comic opera you must stick to
your story and make your music illus
trative of your theme. In a musical
comedy you may have two or three
stories running alternately, or no
stories at all, and your music is all
right, so long: as it is 'catchy.' You are
at liberty to interpolate at will."
"Speaking of vaudeville, have you
ever tried it?"

THREE OF SAN FRANCISCO'S MOST CHARMING MATRONS, WHO

"best" â can be amply demonstrated by
an offhand roilcall of the society wom
en of San Francisco who have fulfilled
their roles of hostesses with a charm
and distinction all their own â gay even
as the gayest â but who at the "chil
dren's hour" are wiih their babes in
the nursery, telling tales of "Goodla,

precious pink parcel of soul and body

what more beautiful vision in the years
to come can the little lad or maiden
hold than of his mother. with her
gleaming white shoulders, her spark
ling eyes and a sweet, cheerful, ex
pectant smile, in her brilliant evening
robe? I seriously question the Impres
sion left upon the child's mind at the
close of day, when his mother's tired
and nooeless face reflects the cares
that beset her. The mind of
the child is like unto our own; we
love the bright, the cheerful, the viva
cious, and the law underlying this uni
versal preference of mankind is not
far to seek. We all turn to the sun
shine, be it physical or personal, by a
natural law. And when a unit of the
human race, or even of the lower verte
brates, refuses the sunshine, literal or
figurative, he is lost â lost in the black
forest of pessimism. And. of course.
What a furor ' Mr. and Mrs. Peter
duties according to her capabilitiesâ
which are infinite. And, 1 while it is
true that there are shirkers in this most
blessed capacity, it is distinctly the
fault of nature â not of social obliga
tions. Those women who shirk their
duties of motherhood would occupy ex
actly the same relation to their children
were they the occupants of dingy, alleys
on the South Side. It Is instinct, com
bined with intelligence, that makes
perfect motherhood, and with the so
ciety girl, who has poise, born of study
and travel, free-visioned as to the fu
ture, and nurtured daily with fresh
happenings, why would she not make
an ideal mother?
To be sure, she would never fill the
roll of the sock-darning mother of ye
olden day, but she will keep nearer to
her husband's pace, and will grow up
with her children as their companion
and their confidante, and herein she
fulfills her destiny.
By your leave, I think the affirmative
has won the case.
This is one of the prerogatives of the
pen â to give no quarter to one's ad
versaries. Besides, what's the use in
"arguing" with a' woman? Like some
of those Revolutionary sires of * oursâ
they don't know when they are beaten.

The performance at the Alhambra
is to be given by the sailor laddies
themselves and is said to be brimful
of zest and ginger. As those qualities
go to make good sea defenders it is safe
to assume they are part of the mental

that they won't play to scant benches
is now assured.
Among the women who have the suc

That the cause is a splendid one for

the pitfalls laid everywhere for their

most of its discursive brethren in that
it has not been passed over to its an

One of the foremost functions of the

W. H. Huntington at her residence, as-
Martin have causedâ Mrs. Martin, par
ticularly. San Franciscans have ever
had a predilection for the Martin boys,
and when one of them brings back a
bride we surely cannot be censured
for looking at her. "Is she as beautiful
as we have heard?" "Is she a good
dresser?" "Is she agreeable?" are all
the questions propounded to those for
tunate enough to meet the young East
erner. To all,' I beg to reply in the af
firmative â she Is. Besides, she pos
sesses that finest of all personal pos
sessionsâshe possesses a distinctive
personality. And it is probably that
which has captivated Newport quite as
much as her beauty and style. It is to
be hoped that Mrs. Martin will dwell
among us for a \ time, until our smart
set has had the pleasre of meeting her.
Mrs. Eleanor Martin has not been in
the betet of health, else she would have

railway, which will gridiron the city of

nucleus for other lines that will result
in a suburban system connecting the
city with all the neighboring town3.
British capital Is now involved in a
scheme to build two branches to the

Is 120 miles long, connecting the two
points after which the road is named.
One of the new branches will be thirty
five miles in length and the other thirty

At this end of the trip the transfer
ring from the steamship to the train
was placed entirely In the hands of
Major C. A. Devol, quartermaster of
the army transport service. His ar
rangements were complete In every de
tail and passed off without a hitch..
NO EXCITEMENT EVIDENT.
There was no hurry, no excitement,
no rush. Everything was as smooth as
possible, and considering that the timÂ«*
was limited and the .duties arduous the
plans of Major Devol were more than
equal to the emergency. Long before
the Korea was sighted a fleet of small
tugs was dancing around the waters of
the bay awaiting her arrival. The Slo
cum- went some distance outside the
heads, but later came back and lay In
shelter, near. Fort Baker until the
steamship was sighted, and then tne
.little fleet dropped into line and so soon
as the Korea came to anchor they sur
rounded her. As soon as the Slocum
was made fast the reception commit

drews, representing General MacAr

Governor W. H. Taft, the newly ap
pointed Secretary of War, arrived from
the Philippines on the Korea at 9:05 a.
xn. yssterday. and at 10:30 a. m.. just
one hour. and twenty-five minutes after
his arrival,, he was speeding away to
Washington on the Pullman car Scylla.
He returns . home in -fine health and
spirits, full. of. life and vigor and ready
to meet and cope with the big questions
he will be called upon to, consider so
soon as he takes up the new duties that
will devolve upon him when he takes
his seat In the Cabinet on February 1.
He possesses an easy, affable, dignified
manner. and a commanding appearance.
His likeness to G rover Cleveland is a
matter, of general comment. His eye is
bright and kind and he was quick to
take in every situation as he landed
yesterday.
Â¦The Korea did not arrive as early aa
expected, but she did arrive In the time
that her commander. Captain Seabury,
announced to Governor Taft as they
sailed out of Honolulu harbor. "I will
take you- to - the Golden Gate by 9
o'clock on the day of January 23," said
Seabury, and ha kept his word. The
Korea was plowing the waters of the
Golden Gate before 9 a. m., and just at
9:05 dropped her anchor off the quaran
tine station. ' j x ' ;
The alarm was at once given * and
searching parties were sent out. The
government forest rangers aided In the
search, and several friends of the young
man went out from this city. The
Sespe Hot Springs are in an almost in
accessible section of the mountains.
They are the property of Mrs. Radford,
mother of the young man, and were
lately acquired from the Government.
VENTURA, Jan. 23.â After a search
extending over a period of six days the
remains of Harry Radford were found
to-day in Johnsons Canyon, a rough
and precipitous gorge, ten miles from
the Sespi Hot Springs.
The body was found by Thomas and
William Harris, miners of that section
and expert mountaineers. It was on
the rocks at the base of a cliff, whither
it had fallen. A bullet hole In the neck
showed that death had been caused
probably by the accidental discharge of
the man's ~ rifle.' The indications are
that the injury was received before the
body fell from the cliff.
It Is supposed that Radford was fol
lowing a deer, and in falling or stum
bling received the wound. He had been
missing since last Monday and search
ing parties had been scouring the hills
for him since. that time. With a com
panion, Barney Mowrey, he had gone

rey had to go back to Fillmore, leaving
Radford alone. On his return Radford
could not be found.

BOY FILLS
FROM CLIFF
There are thirty-three Democrats In
the Senate and 176 in the House. The
Call correspondent saw ninety-nine.
Of these sixty-two declared against
Bryan's self-imposed leadership; four
said they were for doing what Bryan
was advising; "thirty-three declined to
express an opinion.
The West tells the sante story. Even
the silver States abandon sixteen to
one. Senator Newlands, who was a
member of the platform committee in
1900 and whose vote kept in the Kan
sas City platform a reafflrmation of
the Chicago platform, now throws the
Nebraskan overboard. Senator Du
bois of Idaho does likewise.
Other silver States give him no
encouragement. Senator Teller of
Colorado, who gave up more to the
cause of free silver than Bryan did,
because he le,ft the Republican party,
of which he had been a distinguished
member, now refrains from saying a
word to advance Bryan's policy of
retrogression. All of his old mountain
friends stand amazed at the position
he has assumed.
In the Middle West the Democratic
Congressmen Interviewed are general
ly opposed to reviving the sixteen to
one issue.
This was "disclosed to-day when The
Call caused Democratic members of
Congress to be interviewed. They were
especially questioned about the dictum
laid down by Bryan in recent inter
views and speeches that the Chicago
andÂ«Kansas City platforms must be
reaffirmed at St Louis and that the
reorganizers of the party must be kept
at the rear, because, having bolted the
ticket when he was a candidate, they
are not to be considered Democrats.
Democrats from all sections of the
Union declare the party would not
follow Bryan's leadership. They- are
looking for live issues and not dead
ones and say, "Sixteen to one Is as
dead as a smoked herring." They also
hold out the hope that, the party is
going to try something in the way of
a pla'tform which has not been so re
cently repudiated as the platform
Which Bryan % Is seeking to revive.
These views are expressed not only by
Democrats of the East, but iby Repre
sentatives and Senators who sincere
ly believed in Bryan and loyally sup
ported him In his two ill-starred cam
paigns. The South is very generally
against Bryan. Texas is against
Bryan's plan to exclude the reorganiz-"
ers and force sixteen to x>ne into the
platform again. It is against him al
most to a man.
Alabama, Georgia, North and South
Carolina all swing into line for ra
tional and wiser things. Their Repre
sentatives say it is time for Bryan to
stand aside. The veteran Senator
Morgan of Alabama declares Bryan Is
a dead politician and has no license to
tell Democrats what' their duty is.
Dozens of Southern members used the
words: "Free silver is dead."

breakfast," said the farmer, with deep
concern.â N. Y. Tribune.
Even a dead past may sometimes
come to life.
o'clock the Governor, escorted by the
different army officials, passed down
the broad gangway of the Korea to
the upper deck of the Slocum, where
he was greeted by a' number of rela
tives and a sort of family gathering
was indulged in. Among: those in the
party were his sister, Mrs. W. A. Ed
wards; his cousin, Mrs. Charles T.
Blake, and Mrs. Bernard Moses. Mrs.
Taft was nearly smothered by a
wealth of beautiful floral offerings
that were showered on her as she
stepped on to the tug. .
Just at this moment- Major Devol
gave the signal to cast off the lines,
and at the some instant the beautiful
new flag of the Secretary of War was
run up to the masthead. The atten
tion of the Governor was called to it
and he asked what it was. When be
ing informed his pleasant face beam
ed enthusiastically and he laughing
ly said: 2 "It's a new one on me, and
the firstftlme I have ever seen one."
At this juncture the different news
paper men on board the tug were in
troduced to him and he received them
all in a most cordial fashion and
seemed to enjoy the interview great
ly. He was not reticent and tried to
answer any and all the different hun
dreds of questions that were put to
him. During the interview the Slo
cum was put under full head of steam
and headed for Oakland mole, where
the party arrived in plenty of time
for the Eastern (Iyer. The Governor
was escorted from the boat to the
train by his family and large com
pany of friends and officials. The
Governor was accompanied on the
journey East by his secretary, Fred
W. Carpenter. Mrs. Taft and the chil
dren, Helen and Charles W., will re

supposed Presidential aspirations and
the published articles in certain East
ern papers that he is likely -to be put
forward by his friends as a candidate
for the Republican nomination.
"Â¦Jfes, I have read. every one of those
stories," he replied,, with a hearty
laugh, "but they are all part of some
huge joke. There is, nothing in it."
It is said among those who have
been in touch with Secretary Taft dur
ing his gubernatorial service in the
Philippines that his political aspira
tions are soaring in another direction
and that his fondest ambition would
be realized if he were appointed to a
position on the United States Su
preme bench. j
Explaining his hurried journey to
Washington Governor Taft said that
it has no particular significance.
"Mr. Root has been waiting patient
ly for. a month for me to relieve him,"
said he, "and I am anxious to get to
"Washington on January 28, so that
we may confer prior to my entering
on my official duties on February 1,
which is the date of the beginning of
my term, fixed by the Senate in con
firming my appointment."
Regarding the interview accorded
him by the Mikado of Japan during
his short stay in Tokio, which was
briefly announced by cable, Secretary
Taft said that it interested him very
much, but he declined to repeat the
conversation that took place between
the Emperor and himself, as he might
be regarded as guilty of an act of im
propriety in view of the fact that he
was about to enter upon the duties of
Secertary of War.
"Arriving at Tokio," said he, "we
were met by the Japanese Secretary
of Foreign Affairs, whom I had pre
viously known as a Consul General in
Manila. He escorted Mrs. Taft, Sec
retary Carpenter and myself to the pal
ace, where we were introduced to the
Emperor and by him entertained at
luncheon. I found the Emperor
a broad-minded man of modern ideas,
who expressed a very cordial feeling
toward Americans, and he convinced
me that he is an excellent ruler. Of
the prospects for war between Japan
and Russia I can add nothing to what
you already know, for the telegraph
has keot you well advised."
Governor Taft was asked if he had
read any of the recent reports of hia
"We are not looking so far into the
future. "We are simply dealing with
present conditions, but naturally build
ing great hopes for the results of the
work now in progress in the United
States' new possessions."
During his two days' stay in Hono
him, while en route to this city, Gover
nor Taft, in company with Governor
Carter, spent the greater part of his
time inspecting the various industrial
enterprises of that dlty and several
neighboring sugar plantations, visiting
the Government barracks and in mak
ing a careful study of the labor and
social conditions there. Referring to
his observations in Hawaii and partic
ularly regarding the labor conditions
there and in the Philippines Governor
Taft said:
"Xhe Filipinos are intensely opposed
to any Chinese immigration. In the
Philippines a Chinese will make $100
or so from "a year's labor and then
sta/t a shop, driving some Filipino
woman competitor out of business. The
great development of the Hawaiian
Islands was caused by a free access
to the American market, with all thfc
benefits of the national policy of pro
tection, and I deem it as only fair
that Hawaii should now' contribute her
share to the national Government."
CAUSE OF HASTY TRIP.
inÂ£ any benefit from the lessons being
taguht them in self-government Gov
ernor Taft replied that he had been In
formed that the report of the Philip
pine census would be made In Octo
ber and two years thereafter, accord
ing to the law, the natives, provided
they have remained peaceful, will be
permitted to hold an election for a pop
ular assembly; to consist of not less
than fifty members, and this organiza
tion will be co-ordinate with the higher
legislative body. If this assembly is to
be created the commission still has two
and a half years before it in which to
complete its work of law .and statute
making.' for the future government of
the islands. Continuing, he said:
"It* is expected that this assembly
will do much in the way of educating
the natives in matters of good govern
ment and strengthen their patriotic
tendencies. Of course the acts of the
assembly will have to be approved, by
the United States authorities, but the
natives will have a say in the enact
ment of all laws. By the time they
are ready to send their representatives
to the assembly hall it is expected that
they will have acquired a sufficient
knowledge of the methods of govern
ment."
CHINESE ARE OBJECTIONABLE.
Governor Taft declined to express an
opinion as to how long it would prob
ably take the United States, under its
present methods of political education
In the Philippines, to bring the native
population up to a position where they
may be relied upon to govern them
selves without assistance from this
country. He smiled as he remarked:

Count Benckendorff significantly re

"But this/' he continued, "certainly
does not seem worth going to war
about. As regards the Japanese de
mand for the inclusion of a Russian
acknowledgment of. Chinese sover

ter of words, and surely no war about
words would be justifiable. I am
hopeful of a peaceful outcome of the

Among:. the: stories told of Herbert
Spencer some time ago vr&a one relat-.
ing to his boarding-house experiences.
His doctor had. advised him that soli
tary meals were not good for him, and
he went to a boarding-house, but did
not stay. The "pleasant lady" who
sat next to him and who was to en
gage him in light and cheerful talk
was a sad- disappointment. A friend
asked her how she liked the boarding
house; could she, recommend it? "Oh,
yes; I think Iican," she replied; "but
there is a llr. Spencer who thinks
that he knows about science and phil
osophy. I have to correct him every
night!" One of Spencer's peculiarities
was to carry about two little plugs in
his pocket, and whenever conversation
around him 'became annoying he took
them out and put them in his ears. â

PITTSBURG, Jan. 23. â The flood
danger- at this point has passed. All
day long 'both rivers continued to rise
until 5 o'clock this afternoon, when
thirty and one-tenth feet was regis
tered at the Monong-ahela wharf.
From that hour on the waters receded
slowly until at 10 o'clock the gauge
registered 28 feet and stationary. The
temperature is lower and light snow
is falling. The Allegheny is still full
of running: ice. but it is much thinner
than earlier In the day. From the
headwater points on both the Alle
gheny and Monongahela rivers the
reports to-night show them to be
either stationary or falling.
The actual damage done in Pitts
burjr will not reach probably rnore
than half a million, dollars. To this
amount, however, must be added the
loss to the manufacturers and mills
through forced ""shutdowns and to
workmen through suspended wages,
while will' run the total close to the
S 1,000,000 mark. No loss of life has
l'oon reported.
The estimate of the number of men
that are temporarily thrown out of
work by. the flood puts it at 40,000. The
loss in wages will go close to $300,000.
It is known that thirty-five coal
boats, each holding 23,000 bushels of
coal," and two barges, each holding
15,000 bushels, were sunk. The loss on
this property would be about $100,000.
The loss on houseboats, landings, false
works at bridges, coal tipples and other
river property will bring the estimated
loss on river property to $233,000.

Special Dispatch to The Call
EUREKA, Jan. 23. â The fences
which were a few months ago erected
by property owners at the foot of D
street and which cut off entrance
from that thoroughfare to the water
front -were demolished by a crowd of
men, estimated at forty, at 1 o'clock
this morning.
.The men were supplied with picks,
axes and shovels and went quietly but
vigorously to work. Every obstruc
tion was demolished before a member
of the police force arrived on the
scene. There is nothing known that
would disclose the identity of the per
sons who engaged in tearing down the
obstructions.
The fences were erected by Eugene
TVoodin and Colonel AV. L. DufT, who
claim that they enclose their private
property. The city of Eureka -has
brought a suit against them to compel
them to remove the obstructions from
the street. Those who participated in
the night attack on the fences may
have been impatient at the delay
caused by the appeal to the courts
and believed in taking the law into
their own hands.

Resident of Santa Kosa Asks a Court
to Take Action Against
. Sail Franciscans.
SANTA ROSA, Jan. 23. â Mrs. Han
nah A. D. Fleming brought an action
this afternoon in the Superior Court
against Mr. and Mrs. F. J. Connell of
San Francisco to regain possession of
her personal effects and a leasehold
for the White Sulphur Springs, near
this city. The damages wanted amount
to $3000. Mrs. Fleming alleges she
sold the defendants her effects and
lease for $1950; that $250 was paid
on January 11 and the remaining
$1700 was to be turned over on Jan
uary 20 and defendants were not to be
put in possession until the full amount
had been paid. Mrs. Fleming charges
that Connell and his wife forcibly took
possession of the premises contrary to
the agreement and refuse to surrender
the same to her. Mrs. Fleming was
recently sued for court costs and a
debt of her former partner, Emil
Hawes. and the salÂ«Â» of the property
took place about this time. An at
tachment was placed upon the prop
erty, but upon Mrs. Fleming declar
ing she had received all the money
for the sale. of the place, to which
Connell Is said to have given affirma
tion, the attachment was dismissed.

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 23. â C. F.
Murray, a show case manufacturer,
has commenced" suit against the
Llewellyn Iron Works Company for
$10,000 damages, because, he alleges,
one of the workmen of the defendant
company dropped a hot rivet from an
adjoining building, Into a pile of saw
dust on his- premises, setting them on
fire and destroying his entire stock.
EUREKA, Jan. 2^. â Findings of
fact and conclusions of law have been
filed by Judge Wilson of the Superior
Court in the suit of the Eureka and
Klamath River Railroad Company vs.
the California and Northern Railway
Company et al. and Judgment has
been ordered entered in favor of the
plaintiff company.
,The action was instituted to en
force a trackage agreement entered
into between the two roads January
12, "1902. The agreement was the re
sult of a compromise of a suit between
the companies and was signed by the
plaintiff and by F. J. Koster, superin
tendent, for the defendant The suit
was dismissed and the railroad war
was believed to be ended. The ef
â¢fect of the agreement was that the
two companies would exchange deeds
of rights of way and own in common
the track from A street to the east
em limits of the city. . After the suit
was dismissed the defendant company
refused to be bound by the agreement,
claiming that the agreement was im
properly executed in that it had not
the specific sanction of the company.
Unless an appeal is taken the water
front will soon again be opened up
for traffic and the northern part of
the county will have a through connec
tion by rail ,with southern Humboldt.
The Southern Pacific is behind the
Klamath road in the contest and the
Santa Fe, which has succeeded to the
properties of the defendant" company,
is the interested party on the other
side.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The case has been desperately fought
throughout by both prosecution and
defense. Attorneys from the home of
the slain men in Illinois assisted in the
prosecution. The Choissers were well
known in the section from which .they
came, and it is stated that they were of
good family and had always previously
borne good reputations.
It - was claimed by the prosecution
that the detectives entered the room of
the I Choissers without having an
nounced that they 'were officers, and
that if the Choissers resisted arrest it
(Cvas under the misapprehension that
they were about to be the victims of
a hcld-up. It was also contended that
Louis Choisser, the son, who was
killed as he ran from the room into the
hall after his father had been slain
by the detectives, was not in pursuit
of the latter, but that he was running
to summon medical aid for his father,
and, in fact, that he was unarmed at
the time he was killed. Justice Cham
bers ruled that these contentions had
not been established and that the offi
cers shot only in self-defense.
â¢ Joseph . Choisser was'; wanted in
Equality, Ill.V'cn a. charge ot obtain
ing money under false pretenses, and
the local police' were ordered by tele
graph to make "the! arrest. . The three
detectives detailed on the case found
the' men in their" room at the Hotel,
where they resisted arrest and were
both shot and instantly killed by the
officers:" An attempt" was made to hold
the detectives for the shooting on the
ground of insufficient warrant for ar
rest.* .
XOS ANGELES, Jan. 23.â Police De
tectives Hatvley, Murphy nnd Covven,

the killing of Joseph and Louis Chois
ser, father and son, at the Hotel Brox

It may surprise the reader to know"
that there is a sure, permanent cure
for this disease, as the following tes-
timony from Mr. E. A. Leonard, an
American resident in the City of Mex-
ico, will show:': : ; Â¦'â¢
"For twenty years I suffered with
piles, sometimes being confined to my
bed for days at a time. The relief re-
ceived from doctors, both in: the Unit-
ed States and Mexico, was 'temporary,
and more frequently I received ho re-
lief; other medicines, had no effect
It was a continual drag. I was fit for
'nothing. I finally tried pyramid Pile

A Snab for the Kaiser.
After the fire last year in the old
ciety of Marienburg, the former home
of the Teutonic knights, the Kaiser
promised Â£50 to each of the five own
ers of burned houses if they would
rebuild them in the quaint gabled
Ktyl* of the Middle A*es.
Four of the houses -were correctly
reconstructed and each owner receiv
ed Â£50. The fifth made some slight
deviation from the Kaiser's plan and
not receiving the imperial gift, took
down the gables, built the rooms in
rnpderjn style and put this inscription
right Rcroa the front of the house:
Baue niclit auf Herrcngunst;

The Irish horse has lost none of its
excellence. Judging by the sires and
the young gallopers shown at Balls
bridge, it will hold more than its own
in coming races. There may be an
other Galtec Moore, another Ard Pat
rick among the colts, fit to capture
the blue ribbon of the turf; I know
not; but the Irish horse seems to have
a blanket mortgage on the Grand Na
tional Steeplechase, j Tou remember,
I dare say, that in the last Grand Na
tional the Irish bred chasers were 1,
2, 3 when the numbers went up. In
deed, there have been very few year*
since, in 1S39, the great race was es
tablished, when Irish horses have not
won. And if that course be not a test,
then horseflesh \va3 never tested. It
is almost four and a h^lf miles in
length and bristles with thorn fences
and, not to speak of "Beecher's
Brook." the water jump is sixteen feet,
with a grorsed fence on the ta.ke-on*
side. It takes a good man on a stout
hearted horse to face that course. The
history of the Irish winners of this
formidable event â from Matthen
down to Drumcree â speaks clearly
cnouÂ§h the glory of the good breed.

About 3000 head of cattle were
dipped in oil in Colorado, Tex., under
the personal supervision of . J. B.
Goodlett of Quanah for C. A. O'Keefe.
The cattle, are not to be moved from
the O'Keefe ranch, but were dipped,
bellevingthat it would be a benefit to
them. Mr. O'Keefe has had a large
stone dipping vat constructed on his
ranch and is a firm believer In the ef
ficacy of the dip. Mr. Goodlett. who
Is the State agent', for the official dip
adopted by the State Livestock Sani
tary Commission, says that an inves
tigation into the situation has con
vinced him that there is to be prac
tically no movement of cattle across
the line thi3 winter. He thinks there
â¢will be a fair movement v in the spring,
however, -when dipping will be gener
ally practiced. Speaking of the recent
dipping in crude Texas oil that was
done in his home town under Federal
dirction, he says'. it is a conceded fact
that oil will kill the fever ticks, but he
does not believe that dipping, in oil
Â¦will . ever become general. He says
while the oil may not injure the cat
tle, yet for the period of about two
weeks it' transforms them into ithe
most disreputable looking beasts that
ever walked the face of the earth. In
a fortnight the oil has had time to
â¢wear off.â Galveston Xews.

The recent death of Lord Rawton,
Disraeli's secretary and the executor of
his estate, brought to light the follow
ing explanation of how Mrs. Brydges
Willyams came to leave her fortune to
Lord Beaconsfleld: "Dizzy received one
morning a letter from Mrs. Willyamsâ
whom he did know â in which she
said that she had read his novels with
much interest and would like to make
his acquaintance. She also asked a
question which rendered it necessary
for him to answer the letter. Unfortu
nately, the letter was left in his great
coat pocket, and Dizzy did not wear
the coat until several months after,
when he happened to be in the south of
England, and in the very town In which
Mrs. Willyams lived. Coming across
the letter In such circumstances, It oc
curred to him to call upon her, and
Mrs. Willyams was so flattered at, as
she thought, his carrying the letter so
long about him and then calling that
she decided on leaving him her for
tune. That shows how wise it is not to
answer letters," added Lord Rawton. â

WAGON' MOUND, N. M., Jan. 23.â
Fire of unknown origin this morning
destroyed the big Wagon Mound hotel
and for a time threatened to sweep the
entire town. The proprietor of the ho
tel, his wife and all the guests were
forced to flee in their night clothes and
several had to jump from windows to
save their lives. J. W. Jenkins was al
most suffocated before he could be

CHICAGO, Jan. 23.â Upon the man
agement and builders of the Iroquois
Theater has been placed the responsi
bility for the flre horror, in a report
rendered to Mayor Harrison by Fire
Chief Murham to-day. The report was
prepared by Flre Department Attorney
Monroe Fulkerson after examination of
nearly 100 witnesses in the days imme
diately following the fire. No criticism
is made of the building department,
although several violations of the
building ordinances are noted. Attor
ney Fulkerson concluded that the the
ater building was not completed at the
time it was opened, that the theater
employes did what they could to put
the flre out, and that the doors and
exits were generally locked throughout
the building. - ,
Between 300 and 400 relatives of vic
tims of the Iroquois Theater fire at a
meeting to-day began the permanent
organization of the Iroquois Memorial
Association, which has for its chief ob
ject the erection of a monument to the
memory of the persons who lost their
lives in the holocaust. It is proposed
to build a towering building monument
of absolutely fireproof material upon
the site of the theater ruined. Offers
of large sums of money are said to
have been made by several prominent
persons, whose names will be used to
head a public subscription. Whether it
will be their purpose to erect such
hospital or an office building has not
been decided.

been 16,003.
Out of 156,000 houses or flats in Glas
gow, -36.000 have one room only and
70,000 only two rooms.
That the damage to property and
individuals was not greater was prob
ably due to the efficiency of the fire
drill of the employes. When the great
bell at the top of the rotunda sounded
the alarm of flre every janitor, en
gineer and fireman in the building re
sponded and long before the Fire De
partment had arrived the Temple Fire
Brigade had attached hose to the
standpipes, which extend from the
basement to the roof of the structure,
and eight streams of water were
turned upon the flames by the volun
teer firemen. The Fire Department
used but little of its hose, the building
equipment being called into use.
CHICAGO. Jan. 23.â Fire in the
twenty-story Masonic Temple to-day
caused a panic among the 4000 occu
pants of the building and damaged
the stock and fixtures of tenants to
the extent of 520,000. All occupants
of the buildins: escaped without se
rious injury through the bravery of
the elevator men. who remained at
their posts operating their cars while
dense clouds of smoke filled the build
ing. The fire broke out in the suite
of five rooms on the fifth floor occu
pied by Robert Friedlander & Co.,
manufacturers of X-ray apparatus. A
lighted match carelessly thrown by
an employe into a pile of excelsior in
th'! packing room Is believed to have
started the flre. There was a large
number of X-ray vacuum tubes stored
in the company's rooms and these
exploded the moment the heat reached
them. liobert Friedlander, senior
member of the firm, realized the dan
ger from these tubes and worked un
til overcome by smoke, throwing them
out of the window. The flre spread
rapidly from the packing room to the
other rooms and in a few minutes the
entire suite was on flre and the light
shaft of the building was filled with
flames. The thousands of occupants
of the building, with the memory of
the Iroquois Theater holocaust, which
occurred half a square away, fresh in
their minds, were alarmed when
clouds of smoke filled every floor and
rushed to the elevators. Many women
fainted in the scramble to get into
the elevators, but none were seriously
injured-. The large building was
emptied within half an hour after the
fire was discovered. Hundreds of
men and women groped their way
through the smoke and came down
the stairs. The injured were: â¢
Robert Friedlander, aged 45, over
come by smoke and slightly burned;
Julius Ernst, hands and face burned;
John Stack, stock boy, slightly burned
about hands; Henry Buest, slightly
burned about head; B. Smith, 60 years
of age, trampled by crowd: Walter
Daveny, hands cut by flying glass;
"Walter S. Parker, burned about face;
Estelle McJ^eod. burned about face
and overcome by smoke; William

stairs while leaving building, badly
bruised.

t-' Tjjf / vÂ» Â» at times racked his head.
Mr. Peterson is an old resident of San Francisco, well known in archi-
tectural iron work. He says: "I found myself growing very sick. Catarrh
was at the bottom of my trouble. I was quite weak. I had a bad cough.
I had pains in my lungs. I was losing weight and strength rapidly. I had
severe neuralgia. My ears were ringing most of the time, and I was grow-
ing deaf. I looked as if I were going into consumption. I had to lose con-
siderable time from my work, and at last I never felt well enough to do
my work without considerable effort.
A friend advised me to go to the Electro-Chemic Institute, 118
Grant avenue. As medical treatment was doing me no good, I decided to
go. The way the Electro-Chemic specialists took hold of me gave me
confidence. The careful examination which they made of me made me feel
that they knew my exact condition and could cure me.
I have not been disappointed. The very first treatment helped me.
My strength rapidly returned. I had such an appetite in a few days after
beginning the Electro-Chemic treatment I could hardly get enough to eat.
Everything tasted good and everything agreed with me. My cough has
been perfectly cured, and the pains in my lungs arc all gone. The ringing
in my ears has stopped and I hear perfectly. The awful neuralgia that fre-
quently attacked me has been cured. It is man-clous that all of, this could
be done in one short month. I began the Electro-Chemic treatment on De-
cember 16, .1903. and was dismissed thoroughly cured on January 16,
1904 â just thirty days. I have not lost a single day from my work since
I began the treatment, and I am strong and well, and my work is now a
delight instead of a burden.
I am employed at the Western Iron Works, on Beale St., between
Mission and Howard, and I live at 102 Arlington st. I feel it my duty to
recommend to others the treatment which has so quickly, so thoroughly
and so cheaply cured me. (Signed) N. PETERSON,
102 Arlihgton St., San Francisco.

STOCKTON, Jan. 23.â It is proposed
by the Native Sons of the Golden West
to hold the next celebration of Admis
sion dayâ September 9â at the St. Louis
Exposition. The managers of the expo
sition have set aside that date and des
ignated it California day. The Califor
nia commission -.to the fair has turned

and Grant President R. H. McNoble,
who will preside at the celebration, has
accepted the invitation on behalf of the
Native Sons.
Mr. McNoble will leave for Los An

consensus of the various parlors on the
advisability of having a parade of 10,000
Native Sons at St. Louis on September
9. There are 17,000'Native Sons, and it
is believed that fully 10,000 can be in
duced to attend the celebration at St.

Russia's Step to Institute
Laws to Better Conditions of
Peasants Evokes Enthusiasm
ST. PETERSBURG. Jan. 23. â The
Imperial ukase ordering the assem
bling of Government conferences un
der the presidency of the Governors
of the various provinces where the
rural authorities hold office and in
the Governments of Kieff, Volhynia
and Podolia in order to elaborate the
peasant laws, monopolized attention
here, relegating the Far Eastern crisis
to secondary place. The press enthu
siastically hails the proposed reforms,
which are based on the manifesto of
March 11, 1903, the newspapers reit
erating this is the greatest step
for the betterment of the conditions
of the peasantry since the emancipa
tion of the serfs. The ukase is wel
comed by the Liberals," although the
Novostt remarks that "it is a pity that
the peasants themselves and not em
powered specifically to send, dele
gates." The drafting committee pro
poses that the laws shall be guided by
the following: aims':
First, to harmonize the existing
peasant legislation with modern re
quirements.
Second, to reorganize the courts in
order to expedite the settlement of
village disputes. â¢ :
Third, to define individual rights re
garding communal lands.
Fourth, to discover means for stim
ulating individual enterprise and the
adoption of modern methods.
Fifth, to settle disputes between the
peasants and neighboring land own
ers.
Sixth, to institute, in the peasants
respect for the laws and rights of
property.
The new laws will only be applica
ble to the provinces of European Rus-r
sia, where reliable statistics and data
are available, without which the draft
ing committee declines to undertake
the taskr -
x rate practically equivalent to the
Dpen market call loan rate. Gross earn
ings of railroads continue to be well
maintained, sentiment over the Iron
and steel trade outlook has distinctly
improved, and the profitable terms on
vvhich the country's cotton and grain
crops are being marketed is of grow
ing impresiveness.
The growing demand for bonds. has
jeen of small influence in proving senti.
ment over the outlook for securities,
as a pressure of capital for employment
in railroad mortgages is a not unusual
prelude to an expanding market for
stocks. The extraordinary demand for
United States Steel second 5's and for
Rock Island bonds, while overshadow
ing the bond market, has not precluded
a good demand at advancing prices for
higher grade bonds.
Quotations on call for Government
bonds have not changed during the
week.

The entire tranquillity with which the
money market has met the flotation of
a number of railroad bond Issues has
served to prove its adequacy to provide
for this class of requirements, which
has been a source of anxiety for many
months past. The rapid expansion of
the loan item of the clearing-house
banks in the last month has kept alive
this apprehension, but with a loan ex
pansion in a month of $55,000,000 the re
serve item increased over $32,000,000, and
the surplus above the legal requirement
grew to the extent of $3,156,250, money

MOVEMENTS OF LOAN'S.
This kind of professional and feemi
professional operations is subject to
certain rusnicion always in the early
stages, owi.ns? to the ulterior purposes
which may be involved, such as the
making of a market for new securities
designed to be floated. It is also true,
however, that operations of this class
almost invariably serve to introduce
speculative -movement of large scope
nnd of wider public participation. The
persistent abstention of this class of
operators from activity has, in fact, In
timidated the smaller class of ope
rators. The development of these large
operations have been effective In driv
ing to cover a large bear party in the
market who had been obstinate in
maintaining the short side because the
large operators had not made their
appearance on the Ions side. The rush
to cover of the long standing and un
wieldy short interest was a material
factor in the buoyancy late in the
week. The movement was a crys
tallization of a number of influences
which have been under discussion for
some time past, rather than any sud
den change in conditions. The fear of
war between Russia and Japan was
rather definitely eliminated from the
situation and even more so the appre
hension of its unfavorable effect here
should it threaten again. The grow
ing conviction of the abundant re
sources of the money market to meet
all demands upon it has also been of
growing force upon sentiment.

broadened out and grown in volume
in the course of the past week, rising
to a degree of activity and an appear
ance of strength not seen for many
months past. The distribution of se
curities affected by this movement does
not appear to be very wide, ac
cording to the reports of the commis
sion houses, whose dealings represent
the demand of the so-called outside
public which continue to complain of
the small share of the increased busi
ness being done. In contrast the brok
erage lirms having a membership repre
sentative of the large individual ope
rators whose movements are in them
selves on a scale to dominate the mar
ket in ordinary times and whose lead
ership is looked for by a large specu
lative following to decide their action
in the market, have been very conspic
uous in the dealings. In other words
the market has continued largely pro
fessional. Other operations have been
attributed to some of the large bank
ing interests and groups of capitalists
who dominate the control of the prop
erties who3e shares are dealt in on the
Stock Exchange whose activity in the
market was looked upon as that of In
side interests. Operations of the latter
class have been manifest for several
weeks past, but they have been con
fined hitherto to the stoclts of smaller
railroad*-: and industrials of a volume
easily manipulated in the market and
subject to the Influence of speculative
pools. The transactions of the week
have extended to the high grade
stocks, with corresponding growth of
the sympathetic effect on the general
market.
CZAR'S UKASE
IS POPULAR
One of the first acts of Governor Car
ter, in view of the county act decision,
was to instruct High Sheriff Brown to
take charge of prisoners, county and
Territorial, and to resume his general
control of police affairs of all the isl
ands. No definite course was decided
upon except that the Territory must
Immediately take hold of police affairs.
With nobody in charge of jails and
other police matters there might be a
general delivery of prisoners, for as the
law stands the so-called county officers
who have the convicts in charge have
no legal power or duty to detain them.
What the Supreme Court did not de
cide in the county bill case Is regarded
as of the highest importance in view
of the possibility of the Legislature try
ing to enact another county law. The
general issues raised, which apply to
any county bills that may be attempt
ed, were not considered by the court at
all, so that if a new act were passed
in which the one defect found by the
court was avoided, the system might
once more be called in question. Among
the sweeping contentions brought for
ward was that the Legislature of Ha
waii had no legal power to create a
system of county government with
county elections in it. The court did
not enter into this question. The con
tentions as to the transfer of Territorial
property to counties and; the practical
abolishment of the offices ?of High Sher
iff and Superintendent of -Public Works
are in the same class and were all
"passed up" undecided, the court find
ing enough for an adverse decision in
the taxation question.
A meeting of citizens was held with
Governor Carter, when he received al
most as many diverse legal opinions
as there were lawyers in the room.
Business men declared themselves
strongly against county governmen}: in
any shape and also against a special
session of the Legislature. But the
Governor upheld the' Republican' party,
which had tried to enact a county bill,
and cabled to Delegate Ku, his repre
sentative in Washington, to push the
passage of a bill now before Congress,
which it is believed wiil legalize the
local measure. On the "other hand, a
section of the business community has
sent L. A. Thurstcm to Washington for
the purpose of, opposing any such ac
tion. , Attorney General Andrews has
given an opinion that a special session'
of the Legislature will not be needed,
and that the Governor" can carry on
the affairs of the Territory for the next
year and reappoint officials on the basis
of the salaries passed in a former ap
propriation bill.
HONOLULU, Jan. 17.â An immediate
special session of the Legislature may
be the result of the decision of the Su
preme Court declaring the county act
void. It leaves the affairs of the Terri
tory in great confusion. More than
half the Territorial appropriations to
carry on the departments ceasedjwith
the end of last year, the Legislature
leaving the department matters to the
county Boards. of Supervisors. The Ter
ritorial government has to resume
charge of all the matters turned .over
to the Supervisors and county officials.
It is, however, without appropriations
to pay for running the various bureaus,
water works, road boards and the As
sessor's office. There is also no provi
sion to pay for police, the Legislature
having left all such matters to the
counties.
Special Correspondence of The Call,
The statements of New York trust
companies, not yet complete, for the
six months ending December 31 last,
sho\y a net decrease in deposits of $102,
676,033 for thirty-five companies report
ing, and represents a reduction in pro
portion of liability upon bank repre
sentatives, as trust capitalists keep
their reserves largely on deposit with
the banks. But the suggestion is also
made that the present heavy influx of
funds from the interior to New York
may represent in part operations by the
treasury In the transfer of Government
deposits from Interior depositories to
New York to be drawn on in making
the Panama canal payment. The Item
of Government deposits with the New
York banks, however, reflects no such
opinion, and it is said that interior de
positories have not yet served' notice
of any calls upon the Government de
posits. Banking opinion seems to be
that the demand for money has so far
declined as to promise a plethoric con
dition, in the local money market in the
immediate future.

NET? YORK. Jan. 23.â To-day's stock
market was irregular, but the halting
j movement was not more marked than
J is usual under the profit taking, which
jÂ»was invited by the rise. After the pub
i lication of the bank statement there
was an effective rally and the market
closed steady, with no important net
losses on the day. The operators in the
market seemed satisfied with the in
crease in the surplus reserve of the
banks, and were not impressed with the
staggering showing of the increase in
the various items, which broke all rec
ords in several instances. There is gen
eral agreement that the loan expansion
now in progress represents largely a
transfer of obligations from trust com
panies and outside banks to clearing
house Institutions.
DECREASE IN DEPOSITS.
A freight train was switching at
Marshall Pass, near the apex of the
mountain. An empty car was sent on
the siding and struck two lumber
laden flatcars with great force. The
brake chains snapped and the flatcars
started down the siding for the main
track, gaining momentum every sec
ond. They moved so swiftly that the
train crew was unable to head them
off and they were soon thundering
down the steep incline.
The - passenger train was due and
the freight conductor and brakemen
fully expected that the runaway cars
would collide with No. 316, causing a
disastrous wreck. At a sharp curve in
the grade the lumber cars suddenly
jumped the track and rolled 200 yards
down the mountain side.
Because it was two minutes late the
passenger train was a quarter of a
mile below the curve at the moment.
Had Lt not been for this delay it would
have rounded the curve before the
runaway cars reached that point and
great loss of life certainly would have
resulted.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Jan. 23. â Pas
sengers arriving from Colorado over
the Denver and Rio Grande tell of a
hair-raising experience at Marshall
Pass. Because It was two minutes
late passenger train No. 316 was saved
from being wrecked and probably
hurled hundreds of feet down the
mountain side.

The True Story of the Invention of 'Wil-
son's Common Sense Ear Drains Told
by Geo. H. Wilson, the Inventor.
I was deaf from infancy. Eminent doctors,
surgeons and ear specialists treated me at
great expense, and yet did me no (food. I tried
all the artificial appliances that claimed to re-
store hearing-, but they failed to benefit me in
the least. . I even went to the test specialists
in the world, but their effort3 were unavailing.
My case was pronounced incurable!
I grew desperate: my deafness tormented me.
Daily 1 waÂ» becoming more of a recluse, avoid-
ing the companionship cf.people because of thÂ»
annoyance my deafness and sensitiveness
caused me. Finally I began to experiment en
myself, and after patient years of study, la-
bor and personal expense I perfected something
that I found *-ook the place of the natural ear
drums, and I called lt Wilson's Common Sense
Ear Drums, which I now wear day and night
with perfect comfort, and do not even have to
remove th-?m when washing. No one can tell
I am wearing them, as they do not show, anj
as they give no discomfort whatever, I scarce-
ly know JfmyseU.
With these drums I can now hear a whisper.
I Join in the genera 10 conversatlcn and heap
everything going on around me. I can hear a
sermon or lecture from any part of a larga
church or hail. My general health is im-
proved because of the great change my Ear
Drums have made in my life. My spirits are
bright and cheerful; 1 am a cured, changed
man.
S:nce my fortunate discovery lt Is no longer
necessary for 1 any deaf persons to carry a
trumpet, a tube or any other such old-fashioned
makeshift. Sly Common Sense Ear Drum ia
built on the Ftrictest scientific principles, con-
tains no metal, wires or strings of any kind,
and is entirely new and up to date in all re-
spects. It ia so small that no one can see it
when in position, yet it collects all the sound
waves and focuses them against the drum-
head, causing you to hear naturally and per-
fectly. It will do thi3 ftven when the natural ear
drums are partially or entirely destroyed, per-
forated, scarred, relaxed or thickened. It fits
any ear from chiUlhcod to old ag?, male or fe-
male, and aside from the fact that it doÂ«s not
show, it nevor causes the least irritation, and
can be used with comfort day and night with-
out removal for any cause.
With my device I can cure deafness in any
person, no matter how acquired, whether from
catarrh, scarlet fever, typhoid or brain fever,
measles, whooping cough, gatherings In the
ear. shocks from artillery or through accidents.
My Invention Dot only cures, but at once stop*
the progress of deafness and all roaring and
buzzing noises. The grreatest aural aurseons
In the world recommend lt, as well as physi-
cians of all schools. It win do for you what no
medicine or medioal skill on earth can do.
I want to place my 190 page book on deaf-
ness in the hands of every deaf person in the
world. I will gladly sead it free to any one
whose name and address I can get. It de-
scribes and illustrates Wilson's Common Sen?Â»Â«
Ear Drums and contains bona fide letters from
numerous user? In the United States. Canada.
Mexico. England. Scotland, Ireland. Wales.
Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania, India and

and tell the truth about the benefits to be Â¦!<â¢-
rivod from my wonderful little device. Toil
will find the names of people In your ova town

am sure that all this will convince you that

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL..
Few People Know How Uscfnl It Is
in Preserving Health and Beauty.
. Nearly everybody, knows that char-
coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
few realize its value .when taken into
the human system for the same cleans-
ing purpose.
. Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; it is notÂ»a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines and carries
them out of the system. '
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion, it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect In the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money
is in " Stuart's Absorbent Lozenges;
they are composed of the finest pow-
dered willow charcoal and . other
harmless antiseptics in tablet form or
rather in the form of . large, pleasant
tasting lozenges, the charcoal being
mixed with honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
coon tell in a much improved condi-
tion of the general health, better com-
plexion, sweeter' breath and purer
blood, and, the beauty of it is that no
possible harm can^ result-from their
continued use, but, on the contrary,
great benefit. i
A Buffalo physician iny speaking of
the benefits of charcoal says: "I advise
Stuart's Absorbent Lozenges to all pa-
tients suffering from gas in stomach
and bowels and to clear the complex-
ion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver is great-
ly benefited by the daily use of them;
they cost but 25 cents a box at drug
stores, and although in some sense a
patent preparation, yet I believe I get
more and better charcoal in Stuart's
Absorbent Lozenges than In any of the
ordinary charcoal tablets." ;

TO THE PUBLIC
In presenting PAW PAW, a natural stomach, heart and nerve
tonic, I teel that I have added to the science of medicine a force that
is as revolutionary, as was vaccination, as important to mankind as
the discovery of antiseptics and as beneficial in the preservation of
human life and happiness as anything that man's ingenuity or
providential wisdom has ever devised. . .
THE PRACTICAL DRUGGIST AND REVIEW OF RE-
VIEW says: "The juice of the Paw Paw is more efficacious than
pepsin in dissolving albumen. The fruit or juice seems to have the
same effect as a good digestive and is most effective in cases^ of
dyspepsia and habitual constipation."
Having combined this wonderful natural remedy with other
medicaments, I positively assert that I am giving to the world the
greatest stomach, blood, heart and nerve tonic known to mankind.
I know that Paw Paw will make worn-out stomachs almost
as good as new ; will make good, rich blood and build up the ner-
vous system ; will do away with both the necessity and desire for
beer, whisky, wine and other injurious stimulants.
A body that is overworked, a system that is run down, requires
a stimulant. Alcoholic stimulants lift, but let you fall. PAW
PAW LI FTS AND HOLDS YOU !
I want ovcry weak and debilitated person to give Paw Paw a trial.
I want pvitt doctor carefully to test this remedy and then honestly tell the
pubih: tliÂ«* results. - - . Â¦'Â¦â¢;â¢:'
> I want every clergyman, when he feels exhausted, to take Paw Paw and then
tell his friends what he thinks of lt.
I want every mother to introduce Paw Paw into her home. It will prove a
rraÂ«iy acÂ«-nt in curing and warding off many diseases.
1 want every tired woman after a hard day's work or an afternoon's shopping
to tako a tal>lcspoorful of Paw Paw and see how quickly lt will refresh and In-

his father, has robbed two brothers of

cd and Coffins Are Submerged
in Many Graves.
HONOLULU, Jan. 17. âFor two men
to descend into a grave and stand upon
the coffin, one at either end. to weigh
it down into the water until sufficient
earth has been thrown upon it is one
method that has been adopted in the
burial of the dead in Honolulu. Over
crowded cemeteries within the city
limits are responsible for this sacri
lege. To dig a grave without disturb
ing the coffins already buried is becom
ing 'more and more difficult. As many
as three and four holes are sometimes
dug before an unoccupied spot can be
found.
During the last three months five
Â¦burials have taken place at which the
coffins were entirely submerged. In
other cemeteries blasting with dyna
mite has to be resorted to owing to the
hardness of the foundation close to the
surface. A few weeks ago a body re
mained above ground for two days
waiting till a grave was blasted out
of the rock, and in a period of three
months as many as thirty-seven coffins
v.-Â«?re disturbed by the grave diggers.
Bome of those coffins wore actually
chopped in two. parts of the remains
being reburied beneath the new coffins.

ST\ I.OUIS. Jan. 23.â The Federal'
Grand Jury to-day returned an indict
ment against Joseph Ralph Burton.
United States Senator from Kansas,
"charging him on nine counts with hav
ing accepted five checks of 5500 each '
from the Rialto Grain and Securities ;
Company between November, 1902, and j
March 26, 1903, for his alleged services
.in interceding with the Postmaster j
General, the chief Pcstofflce Inspector
â¢and other higrh officials to induce Jhem
to render a favorable decision in mat- j
ters affecting the permission of the Rl
* alto company to use the mails.
. Major Hugh C. Dennis, president of
the company, and W. B. Mehaney, as
sociated with him, are named in the
Indictment as the men who gave the
checks to Burton.
. For several days past William E.
Cochran, chief Pcstoffice Inspector,
'from Y.'arhington; Major Hugh C.
Dennis and W. B. Mehaney have been
before the Grand Jury and it is be
lieved the indictment was found on
their testimony.
The purpose of Senator Burton's al
leged intercession was, it is stated, to
prevent the issuance of a fraud order
"sguinst the Rialto Grain and Securities
- Company.
As a result of his connection with
the company, Dennis was indicted In
both the Federal and the State courts,
but the United States Court acquitted
him. Four indictments found in State
courts scainFt Dennis are still pending. !
WASHINGTON*. Jan. 23.â Senator j
Burton said to-day that he could not j
imagine why an indictment had been J
found ag3inst him. He was employed !
as attorney for Dennis to defend him '
nsrainFt an indictment. Dennis came
here to consult with him as to the pro
ceedings and the Senator accompanied
Dennis to the PostofTice Department
urd asked if any charges had been
filed acrair.st Dennis. He further
r.Fked Inspector Cochran to inform him
* (Burton) if charges were filed against
Dennis in future. Senator Burton said
he specifically stated, that he did not
r.ppenr agpinst the Government in any
â¢ inanncr.
Senator Burton will go at once to
St. Louis and defend the case, and has
no doubt that he will be able to make
it perfectly clear that there is no reason
for bringing the indictment.
Tho penalty provided upon conviction
* "for the offense with which Senator
.Durton is charged is a penitentiary sen
tdhce of not more than two j-ears and
a fine of not more than J10,<XM), and

a pine forest at night and suddenly
perceiving in the utter darkness a
gleam of silver light, might compare
the moon shining to some fairy palace
â¢with glittering window panes; In short,
to some object of his experience or
imagination. The Japanese poet, on
the other hand, would compare the
glimmering light to "a moonlit crag of
Fusiyama."
The Japanese always remains an ob
server. He never becomes one with na
ture. . He does not possess the faculty
of endowing inanimate objects with
life. To invest clouds and woods with
human thoughts and desires, as, for
instance. Shelly has done, seems bald
and meaningless to him, and such a
sentence as "Aurora, veiling herself in
clouds, like a blushing girl," he would
consider in very bad taste. He looks
at the world with the eyes of an ideal
realist, or, rather, of an impressionist.
Life passes like the dissolving views of
a magic lantern, showing one beautiful
landscape after the other, each one
containing sufficient material for an ex
quisite vignette.â The Reader.

Metzger & Franklin, a local lottery
firm, reports being mulcted to the tune
of $15,000 on Friday last by a' clever
trick perpetrated by a "supposed St.
Louis crook, whose means of fraud
were two bogus lottery tickets, so per
fect in imitation of the genuine coupons
that they. easily passed the scrutiny of
the lottery firm, and it was not until
yesterday that the latter discovered
they had been duped.
The police were at once communi
cated with and an investigation showed
that the man had arrived here from St.
Louis, where the genuine tickets are
printed, a week ago yesterday and reg
istered at the Lick House. He had by
some means secured in St. Louis the
paper on which the tickets are printed
and called in the services of a printer
here to reproduce some of the alluring
slips. As soon as the winning num
bers were published they were printed
on the duplicate coupons, each of which
called for $7500 and both were promptly
cashed by check when presented at the
office of Metzger & Franklin. When
the firm discovered the trick it engaged
the services of Handwriting Expert
Kytka, who pronounced the forgery a
clever one.
The crook, after receiving the two
check3 for $7500 each, went to a bank,
but as. he had no one to identify him,
they were not cashed. He then called
on Adolph Ottinger, the ticket broker
on Market street, and asked him if he
would indorse the checks. Ottinger
was obliging and the crook returned
to the bank. Instead of taking coin, he
secured drafts for the amounts on Xew
York and took his departure for Los
Angeles.
When Metzger & Franklin were no
tified of these facts the bank was com
municated with and payment of the
drafts was stopped, so that the crook,
through his own carelessness, may not
gain anything by his bold fraud. His
description was wired to Los Angeles
by the police, with a request that he be
arrested, but doubts are expressed as
to whether he could be convicted for
forging an illegal document.
Henry Lunstedt, grand secretary of
the Grand. Parlor of the Xative Sons
of the Golden West, has been deposed
from his position, the reason being
that he is short in his accounts in the
sum of about $7000.
Although it was known j'esterday
that Lunstedt was a defaulter the offi
cers of the Grand Parlor of the Xative
Sons would neither affirm nor deny the
accusations that the trusted official
had betrayed the trust reposed in him
ever sinceÂ»thc society had been formed.
For twenty-two years Lunstedt
served as secretary of the Grand Par
lor and not a word had ever been ut
tered against his integrity. The news
that he is a defaulter came as a great
surprise to the thousands of the mem
bers of the organization.
For the last two weeks the officers
of the Grand Parlor of the Xative Sons
have quietly pursued an investigation
of Lunstedt's accounts. i
Secrecy has been maintained and the
officers have been warned not to make
public any of their findings, but the
startling news leaked out despite the
precautions taken.
Lunstedt was deposed from his posi
tion as grand secretary a few days ago
and Charles H. Turner of the Mer
chants' Exchange was elected to serve
for the term which expires next April,
when the Grand Parlor holds its an
nual meeting.
The various officers of the Grand
Parlor that are located in this city re
fused yesterday* to discuss the short
age of Lunstedt, and every effort is
being: made to hush the matter up.
L-unstedt and his intimate friends were
engaged yesterday in trying to raise
enough funds to make good the defal
cation. ./
James C. Gallagher, second grand
vice president, and Henry S. Martin,
grand treasurer, were seen yesterday,
but they declined to. make any state
ment as to Lundstedt's shortage. They
declared that Lundstedt was a "good
fellow" and that "everything would
be arranged satisfactorily."
Lundstedt's brother, Theodore Lund
stedt, admitted that his brother was a
defaulter, and said that the. accused
man did not care to make a statement
at the present time.
It is generally admitted that Henry
Lundstedt has? worked hard for the
success of the' Xative Sons and that
the defalcations of which he is ac
cused arose from his desire to enter
tain out-of-town members of the or
der when they visited San Francisco.
The loose methods of bookkeeping pur
sued by Lundstedt and passed by the
grand officers enabled the disgraced
man to cover up his peculations.
The sums of money that he used ille
gally are spread over the last seven
years, and were taken in very small
sums from time to^time. Lundstedt has
no property or means to make good his
For some unknown reason the police
hare not yet confronted Landlord Xei
blas with Mrs. de Lareuelle. clerk in the
Native Sons cleaning establishment.
Mrs. de Lareuelle made the statement
that she recognized Joseph Xeiblas,
Soeder's former landlord, as the man
that brought the gray suit to her that
â¢was worn by Soeder on the night Blaise
was murdered. Her identification was
made after seeing an excellent picture
of the landlord, and she still maintains
her story, despite the efforts of the po
lice to have her keep silence.
Detective Thomas Gibson yesterday
corroborated the statement of Mr?, de
Jvareuelle as published in The Call yes
terday. He says that the woman told
him Friday th&t she was sure that Xei
blas was the man that dolivered
Soeder's suit at the cleaning establish
ment.
Mrs. de Larouelle remain* as. positive
p.s ever on the point of her identifica
tion, and it is the duty of the police to
ipve her a char.ee to see the man face
to face. It is believed that Xeiblas
knows more than he has told.
Detective Gibson has been looking for
a. man resembling Xeibias, who he
thinks is in oxistence ajnd knows some
thing of Socder's transactions. He gets
his clew from Xciblap. who states that
on December 31 a woman of Spanish or
Mexican nationality rented the top floor
of his little house on Jackson street.
The woman paid J18 rent and left, but
never returned to the rooms. Â¦
Xeiblas claims that the woman, who
cave her name as Mrs. Grove, was seen
taJking to Soeder after she had rented
the rooms. Gibson located her In her
rooms on Broadway yesterday. He in
terrogated her to find out if she had an
acquaintance of dark complexion that
knew Soeder. It was the theory of Gib
son that the woman who talked to
Seeder had a man living with her, and
that this man may have been connected
with Soeder in getting rid of incrimin
ating evidence after the crime was
committed. -'- / -'v
Mrs. Grove, as she calls ; herself,
claims 5he does not know Soeder and
denies an acquaintanceship with any
man associated with Soeder. Gibson
claims that the woman could give him
no evidence, yet he paid her several
visits yesterday.
The police have as yet insufficient
proof against Soeder, and know it. They
want to postpone the Coroner's inquest,
â¢which has been srt for Tuesday next,
although it is necessary that it be held
hrfore the preliminary hearing, which
has been set for Wednesday, the 27th
inst. â¢*- 7 i?VÂ£
ThÂ« police are busy summoning wit
n<*ses and expect to have more than
thirty at the examination next Wednes
day. Detective Gibson feels confident
that Judge Cabaniss will hear enough
evidence to warrant his binding Soeder
aver to the Superior Court for trial for
the murder of Blaise.
ORDER NOT AFFECTED.
Grand President McXoble Issues SUte
ment on the Lunstedt Matter.
STOCKTOX. Jan. 23â Grand Presi
dent McXoble of the Xative Sons gave
out a statement to-day regarding the
defalcation of Lunstedt. He says in
part:
"It is a fact that the grand secretary
is short in his accounts. According to
his own confession he has been short
for eight years. The system he em
ployed is new to experts. He kept a
double set of accounts, only one of
which the officials knew about. In a
second set of books he recorded his
peculation?. His own handwriting
shows the amount of money taken. His
misdeeds will not affect the business of
the Grand Parlor or the management
of the order."

worlds most prolific, tireless and ver
satile producer 'of pills. She sends
forth these pellets of health at the rate 1
of l.'O tons of pills a monthâ nearly
2000 tons a year. It is a mark of the
benevolent spirit of Detroit that she
consumes but a small portion herself,
sending the greater part to ease the
ills of other places. There is no malady
on earth which . the' 1700 varieties of pills
made in Detroit will not alleviate. â

One EnglJslunan's Wit.
One of the hits in Lew Dockstader's
performance the other night at Ham
merstein'a Victoria was his imaginary
receipt of wireless messages from the
McClellan banquet. He had . dined
with half a dozen lively individuals
and an Englishman, all of whom had
witnessed the show the evening before.
"Weally, Mr. Dockstader," said the
Englishman, "can you explain how
that Marconigram from Mr. Bryan got
to the McClellan dinner, if there is no
wireless apparatus on the Celtic?"
"Dead easy," he replied, "but you
Â¦won't give me away?"
"Of course, I won't."
"Did you notice when I waved my
hand in the air last evening? Yes? I
sent it myself."
Then the Britisher got back at
Dockstader. "Very good trick. Very
I suppose you'd call that the
'lay of the last minstrel.' '\

In their efforts to raise money to aid
in the completion of a new $15,000
church at Humboldt a number of the
women of the Congregational church
pledged themselves to contribute $1
each toward the purchase of carpeting
for the new structure and to earn the
money, by manual labor. Mrs. "Will
Strong, Mrs. Corry and Mrs. Ferryby,
wife of Dr. Ferryby, went out into a
cornfield and in half a day husked
forty bushels of corn, receiving for
their work 3 cents per bushel. Not
making the necessary dollar, they went
into a neighboring beet patch. the fol
lowing day and pulled beets, for which
work the farmer paid them and then
donated the beets. Miss Mabel Fuller
and Miss Minnie Nichols, school teach
ers, sold popcorn at the football games
and on the streets. Failing to raise the
necessary amounts they hired out to
do the janitor work of the Courthouse
for- a short time.â Chicago Record-

Is Man Lazy?
The London Daily Mail finds that
modern life tends to make us all lazy;
that people will no longer read poetry
because it requires effort; will no longer
row boats, dance dances or take a game
of whist seriously. And in this change
there lurks a certain amount of truth.
The modern man will show you, plenty
of energy when ho thinks it useful in
his affairs. If he will not read poetry
he will at least spend weary hour3
writing it, for the sake of the magazine
editor's check. If he will not dance
he will buy up a whole theatrical troupe
and wear himself thin in, trying to
raise money enough to keep them on
the road. He no longer enjoys a quiet
game of whist with three old cronies
on Saturday night; but propose to him
a game of bridgeâ well, that, too, is
something he can use in his business.
The fact is, the modern man is des
perately lazy when he Is not doing
something.â Boston Transcript.

shape. Large sales have taken place in
several portions of the city during the.
week just" closed.* The total for the
week is large. Deals that were pending
are being comsummated. At this the
dealers are not surprised, for they have
known that the interest in the market
has been strong. The only factor that
retards sales in the business section is
the stout holding on by owners of busi
ness properties well situated. A review
of the proceeding of the week reveals
the accuracy of the judgment of the
dealers.

For George S. Montgomery, lot' 17,' Los
A good ofd family physician with. a
lifetime experience in saving people
finally found himself sick unto death.
Medicines failed andâ but let him tell
his own story. "For the first time in
my life of 61 years, I am impelled to
publicly testify to the value of a large-
ly advertised article, and I certainly
would not pen these lines except that
what seems to me a direct act of Provi-
dence saved my life, and- I am im-
pressed that it is a bbunden duty to
make it known.
"For three years I. kept- failing with
stomach and liver disorders, until I was
reduced 70 pounds from my normal
weight. When I got too low to treat
myself, three of my associate physi-
cians advised me to 'put my house in
order,' for I would be quickly going
the way of all mankind. Just about
that time I was put on a. diet of Grape-
Nuts predigested food. Curiously
enough, it quickly. began to build me
up, appetite returned, and in fifteen
days I. gained six pounds. That started
my return to health and really saved
my .life. .
"A physician is naturally prejudiced
against writing such a letter, but in
this case I. am willing to declare it
from the housetops that tho multiplied
thousands who are now suffering as I
did can find relief and health as easily
and promptly by Grape-Nuts, if they
only knew what to do. Sincerely and
fraternally yours." Name of this prom-
inent physician furnished by Postiim
Co., Battle Creek, Mich.

Among the Eastern nations the be

for the child. The priest or astrologer
must be consulted to choose a lucky
day. Every precaution must be taken
to avert the jealousy of the gods,
whose malice is especially directed
against a fine boy.
The Chinese father who adores his
son will take the utmost pains to con
vince the powers of the air that the
boy is of no account. The child may

NEW YORK, Jan. 23.â Jules B. Niel
son, son of Frederick Nielson and
brother of Mrs. Reginald Vanderbllt,
whose marriage . to JVIiss Marguerite
Wall on January 9 was announced only
to-day, spent the day in an endeavor
to gain access to his bride, whose fath
er, Frank T. Wall, a wealthy rope man
ufacturer, alleged, was keeping
her from her husband against her will.
A resort to. legal proceedings was
threatened by the groom.
Nielson and his bride left the resi
dence of the latter's father together
this evening. Nielson said:
"It's all right now; we have become
reconciled."
, He refused .to say whither they were
going, but it is understood that the cou
ple Intended to go to Philadelphia. No
particulars of the reconciliation could
be obtained from the Wall family.
The engagement of Nielson and Miss
Wall was announced last October, but
the Wall family objected so vigorously,
it is said, because Nielson was a Ro
man Catholic and Miss Wall a Protest
ant, that they were married secretly on
January 6, Mrs. Nielson continuing to
reside at her father's house. â¢ -'
Jules Nielson is well known in New
York society. His elder sister was the
wife of Arthur Kemp, but procured a
divorce from him in Rhode Island last

CALL BUREAU. 1406 v G STREET,
X. W., WASHIXGTOX, Jan. 23.â Chief
Justice Fuller and Justice Harlan- of
the Supreme Court this forenoon car
ried to President Roosevelt their dis
pleasure at the precedence given the
diplomatic corps at the judiciary recep
tion on Thursday night. Their com
plaint that they were obliged to wait
at the door of the blue room, where
stood Major Charles McCawley,* United
States Marine Corps, while diplomats
big and little filed through to receive
the President's greeting fell upon sym
pathetic ears.
The President regretted the incident.
He did not declare, it is understood,
that the judiciary should have prece
dence over the diplomatic corps, but
he did consider that at Judiciary recep
tions members of the Supreme Court
and othrr tribunals should be received
before any one' else. The way" to ar
range the matter would be for mem
bers of the diplomatic corps to be in
vited behind the receiving line, in the
blue room. Then the reception would
open with a welcome to the members
of the Supreme Court, followed by the
members of the Court of Claims, the
Court of Appeals and the Supreme
Court of the District of Columbia.
As a reason why the diplomats
should be received first on all occa
sions it is rited that at all foreign cap
itals the diplomatic corps has prece
dence over all officials of the country
to which its members are accredited,
except the sovereign and the royal
family.
Although the dignity of the honorable
court has been satisfied, the question
cf precedence at White House recep
tions and the State Department's re
quest that the diplomatic corps appear
at these functions in their court dress,
continue to excite the risibilities of the
public.
Dailj' were given a chance behind the
bat and honors were about even be
tween them.

NEW YORK, Jan. 23.â The marriage
of Miss Emma Wallace Rutherford,
daughter of Mrs. George Crocker, to
Philip Kearney, son of t General John
Watts Kearney of Washington, was
solemnized to-day in St. Thomas Pro
testant Episcopal Church, Fifth avenue
and Fifty-third street. There were* sev
eral hundred guests present to witness
the ceremony, which was occompanied
by choral services by a vested choir.
The chancel was profusely- decorated
with white lilies, white roses'and palm's,
and vases of lilies and roses orna
mented the marble altar.
Miss Rutherford was escorted to the
altar and given away by her stepfather.
She was attired in a rich gown of ivory
white satin, the skirt and bodice em
bellished with beautiful point de venice
lace. The veil of tuile was fastened with
a wreath -of -orange blossoms and two
superb diamond pins, gifts from the
bridegroom. She also wore a collar of
pearls, a present from her mother, and
carried a bouquet of white orchids.
Miss Alice H. Rutherford, the bride's
sister, was maid of honor. Thomas
Kearney was best man.
A reception was held at the residence
of Mr. and Mrs: Crocker, 1 East Sixty
fourth street. *
Mr. and Mrs. Kearney will sail for
Europe on the Cedric on Wednesday.
They will spend their honeymoon on
the Riviera and will return to New
York in about two months.
Among the bridal gifts were a set of
silver plates from the bride's sister, a
silver table service from the bride's
brother and $500,000 in bonds from Mr.
Crocker.
WASHINGTON, Jan.| 23.â The House
devoted the entire day to consideration
of the army appropriation bill in com
mittee of the whole.' Robinson (D.) of
Indiana took occasion to criticize the
War Department for the expenditures
made by the bureau of ordnance and
fortifications in connection with, the
Langley airship. Only twelve of the
forty-one pages of Â»the bill had been
read for amendment when the House
adjourned. The provision in the bill for
the construction .of a submarine cable
from Sitka to Fort Liscum, Alaska,
went out on a point of order.
A spirited discussion was precipitated
by Hemenway, chairman of the Appro
priations Committee, who proposed a
limitation on the purchase of books and
periodicals for the army. The amend
ment providing for the purchase of
technical and professional works only
finally prevailed. #
Robinson of Indiana in criticizing the
expenditure of money by the "War De
partment in the Langley airship experi
ments said:
"I -will charge directly to the officers
of the Government, to Its officials and
to its departments a system of twisting
the construction of our appropriations,
a system of enlargement running wild,
and in that charge I see that the War
Departmentâ yes, and the head of the
"War Departmentâ has permitted an ex
penditure for scientific purposes of over
$200,000 in a vain attempt to breathe
life into an airship project, which col
lapsed and which was known, it seems
to me, by every sensible man to have
no utility about It; and Oiis he did with*.
out the sanction of Congress by a mis
construction of S.n act."

Forget Your Stomach and You'll Have
a Santa Claas Face,
HOW* TO DO IT.
If there is one thins more than all
others that will give a man a forlorn
â¢ and friendless appearance and make
him jnorBid and "cranky" and dis-
agreeable, that thing is dyspepsia. It
makes one forgret his friends and be-
come morose and irritable. He Is so
wrapped tip in his own misery that he
is inconsiderate of every one else. Re-
3Jpved of this terrible and depressing
ailment, he again becomes a good fel-
low and a man among men. *"Â«-,Â¦
" Â»?iuart's Dyspepsia Tablota are be-
yond question the most effective and
.popular remedy ever offered to the
sufferers of this terrible disease. The
thousands and thousands of cures they
have brought about and the enormous
increase 'of their-sales fully attest the
truth' of this statement.
â¢ They are, above all, a natural rem-
Â«dy. They possess exactly the same
properties thnt the gastric Juices and
other digestive fluids of the stomach
possess and they actually do the diges-
tive work of the stomach and enable
that organ to rest and recuperate and
become sound and well. They act In
a. mild, natural manner and cause no
disturbance in the digestive organs.
They prevent any fermentation of the
food, which causes sour stomach. In
fact, under their influence the sub-
ject forgets that he h?.s a stomach
Â¦and hi<? resulting cheerfulness presents
a. great contrast to his former dejec-
tion.
Millions of boxes of Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets are sold annually and
they are but In the dawn cf their
popularity. Every mail brings letters
of thanksgiving from grateful ones
who have been cured of this terrible
disease. The following is one of hun-
dreds received each week:
Rev. J. R. Hoag of Wyraore, Nebr..
writes: "For six years I have been
troubled with dyspepsia. Last fall I
became very much alarmed at some
pymptoms of heart trouble and came
lo believe there was a sympathetic re-
lation between the two diseases, or
rather, that the stomach trouble was
the cause of the heart disturbances. I
hit upon Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
for a remedy and invested a dollar and
a half for three boxes, which lasted
me three months, and I can eat any
kind of food I want and have. a good,
vigorous appetite. Although I am 77
years old. I now feel perfectly well
and without being requested by any
one I make this statement as a com-
.pliment to the virtues of Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets."
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are for
eale by all druggists at 50 cents a box.

there -were doubtless large loans on

The police have been told that Miss
Schaefer had jokingly said to a friend
that her sweetheart was in town and
that she had "fired him, but he would
not stand. for the fire."
BEDFORD, Indj, Jan. 23. â Search
for the murderer of Miss Sarah Schae
fer has as yet brought' no definite re
sults. A few red hairs, found clutched
in the hands of the dead girl and be
lieved to have been torn from the
mustache of her murderer, and a
bloody brick found near the body,
which was used to kill the girl, form
the only clews.
Three courts of inquiry are being
held by Coroner Plummer, Justice
Fletcher and Mayor Smith. All the
suspicious characters of Bedford have
been apprehended and examined as to
their whereabouts on the night of the
murder. Xo motive has been found
for the crime. Miss Schaefer was not
robbed. She was brutally beaten, but
not otherwise mistreated. The ac
cepted theory of the police Is that the
murderer was known to his victim and
approached her without creating any
suspicion in fier mind, and that he sud
denly dealt a blow that rendered her
unconscious .before she could call for
help. The police are working on some
slight clews," which they say point to
the thedry that the motive was re
venge. 'â¢; . â¢

Ali Asgar and his son speak French
and German and both are most en
thusiastic when talking of Persia as
they hope to see it. Quoli Khan, the
Minister of Education, speaks English
with fluency and will serve as inter
preter for the party in this country.
7 :e Grand Vizier is looking forward
with pleasure to his visit to Washing
ton, where he expects to meet Sir
Henry Mortimer Durand. the British
Minister, who for flve years was sta
tioned at Teheran and for whom All
Asjrar cherishes a warm regard.
, Accompanied by Mirza Ahmed
Khan, one of his sons; Mehdi Quoli
Khan, the Vice Minister of Education,
and four servants, Ali "Asgar left
Teheran and traveled leisurely through
India, China and Japan. Th/Â»y are
here and leave to-day. They sail from
Xew York February 1 and expect to
reach Mecca February 23. .
Shortly before leaving Persia the
Grand Vizier gained the enmity of the
corrupt politicians by uncovering . a
system of graft in the custom house.
For every $4 of actual revenue only
SI was reaching the treasury. The
grafters were harvesting the surplus.
The Grand Vizier performed the Folk
act with the difference that State Su
preme courts never interfere with the
measuring out of Persian punishments,
and the career of the Shah's faithless
stewards ended with, their conviction.
Before leaving Persia Ali Asgar pro
posed a number of radical reforms.
There was great opposition and sev
eral attempts were made. to poison the
Grand Vizier. Vigilance 4 saved him,
.but to a good Mohammedan there is
nothing like a pilgrimage to Mecca for
insuring long life. A visit to the sa
cred city, it is said, insures the pilgrim
immunity from poison for two years.
The Grand Vizier â¢ secured a .seven
months' leave of absence and Septem
ber 22 set forth on his pilgrimage. Be
fore leaving he asked that his pro
posed reforms receive careful consid
eration during his absence and a cable
gram received at Tientsin, he said yes
terday, gave him hope that his, sug
gestions v.ould be adopted upon his re
turn to Teheran.
is ereat in Persia, and as the Pre
mier's schemes must be worked out
in spite of their united opposition his
battle has been a hard one and there
is plenty of lighting still ahead. Be
ginning- the g-ood work at home, the
Grand Vizier is having his sons edu
cated in France. Austria and Ger
many. This has made enemies for
him among such of the nobility as
thinks Persia holds all a Persian
ought to know. . ". . ....
Â¦ Ali Asgar's plans for the awakening
of his people nre Faid to be bitterly
opposed by the priests. Their power
AH Asgar, for such is his name
?horn of titles, has for twenty-four
y*Â»ars occupied higli positions, includ
ing that of Prime Minister and virtual
ruler of Persia. Every step forward
taken by that country during the last
two decades has been made at his in
stigation. Jn ihe midst of darkness
All Asgar has maintained a constant
fight for lip-ht and more than once ha3
made himself very unpopular in the
easy-golcs land for chose place
among nations he is battling.
He sees in education Persia's salva
tion mid to America he looks more
than to all the lands of the earth for
inÂ«pirÂ»tio:i and resistance in securing 1
this boon for his people. Ali Asgar
personally has established more than
fifty schools in Persia and much of
the leisure his present journey through
the United States affords him will be
devoted to studying educational
methods in the large cities. Of the
schools established in Persia by Amer
ican missions he rpraks with gratitude
and declares that no settlers in his
< onntry arc more warmly welcomed
:han these pioneers of the civilization
h<? covets for Persia.
To those that expect to see any
thing of the fierce Oriental in the
Grand Vizier, Mirza AU Asgar Khan
is unsatisfying as the imaginary ban
quet spread by Prince Barmecide for
the hungry Sch?.cabac. He is worth
reein^. however, and of the many dis
tinguished foreigners who have halted
here on their travels east or. west none
looked more of a "personag< 1 " than
the sriz3!e-ha.ired. well-groomed, alert
little man who arrived yesterday on
th* Korea.
Tlie Grand Vizier of Persia arrived
yesterday on the liner Korea and in
the big crowd gathered on the Pacific
Mai! Company's wharf everybody who
had ever read th<? "Arabian Nights"
craned neck and strained eyes in the
effort to see how a really truly Grand
Vizier looks. There are few titles that
in themselves convey to the Occidental
mind quite fo much of mystery anl
romance as that borne by San Fran
cisco's distinguished visitor. He has
held high and powerful offices for
twenty-four years and knows all about
the winding secrets of the Grand
Vizier business. ft
Po!iticai!y he is a reformer, of demo
cratic taste*. Domestically he is the
husband of about 100 wives. As a
try* Mohammedan he declines to dis
cuss his domestic affairs with unbe
lievers.

SECRETARY of State John Hay was recently in re
ceipt of a report from Ernest Lyon, United States
Minister to Liberia, in which he sets fprth the des
perate plight of some lately arrived negro colonists from
our Southern States and strongly advises against the in
discriminate colonization schemes which arc yearly send
ing to the African black republic hundreds of helpless
men and women to fight against disease and even star
vation. After recounting the history of one group of
hapless colonists whose number was reduced from sixty
lo thirty-six and whose few remaining healthy members
arc making their best efforts to get ou of the country,
the American Minister says: "Owing to the agitation
now going on in the United States on the subject of.ne
gro emigration to Liberia by irresponsible persons
whose literature has wide circulation among the innocent
and poorer class of negroes, the question becomes one of
gravity for the consideration of both governments."
Minister Lyon's report calls official attention to abuses
which have been carried on undisturbed for years. Few
people realize that in blindly advocating a* return on the.
part of the American negroes to the home of their an
cestors they arc acting purely upon a . sentimental im
pulse and may be doing immeasurable harm to those
whose best interests they have at heart. For they arc
urging a people who have been so long attached to

Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria, In a
recent interview with the Sofia corre
spondent of the Berlin Lokalanueiger,
accused the European press of system
atically makinc fun of him and his
people. He said it was absurd to call
him an absolute ruler. The Bulgarian
constitution is one of the most demo
cratic in Europe, and he is hardly more
than a President of a republic. His
chief ambition is to be the teacher of
the people and to lead Bulgaria toward
a higher civilization and a broader cul
ture. ' He suggested that writers- in
European papers should make a Jour
ney to Bulgaria and study the country.
Then they would stop joking and begin
to appreciate the great civilizing work
he and the Bulgarian people have ac
complished. He also explained to the
correspondent that in spit? of his long
reign in Bulgaria the west European
papers still call him "the Koburg."
"Why don't they gi _ that surname
to the Belgian King?" he asked.

The authentic history of Korea be
gins at a date seme hundreds of years
anterior to the foundation of Rome.
It was In B. C. 1123 that Kitsu, brother
of Woo Wang, fled trorn the Chiness
court, and was elected Kins by the Ko
reans. He 13 said to have taught thÂ«
Koreans etiquette, integrity, agricul
ture and rearing of silkworms and thÂ«
spinning and weaving of silk. For the
better government ef the country he
established eight laws, which were so
well observed that, in that golden age,
theft was unknown, and no house -was
barred.
Seoul, the capital of the Korean king
dom, to which marines have been sent
for the protection of the legations, is
about flfty-seven miles from the port
of Chemulpo. It is situated in a. hol
low, surrounded by rocky hills up and
down which run the city walls, inclos
ing an area of about ten square miles.
The interior has three streets, about
sixty yards wide and well kept, but
the remainder is a labyrinth of narrow,
filthy, uneven lanes. The city was
founded originally as far back as 1337.

"He didn't know why I had called,
but he ushered me into a room. In a
corner was a trundle bed with two
children tumbling in a fever. The
mother was there, sitting at the bed
side, wearied by long watching. The
man, haggard and marked beyond a
question by mental tortures, said:
" 'You must excuse me for bringing
you in here, but we have had much
trouble. Two of our children are gone
âdied from the fever that these little
ones are sufferers from. I have been
out of employment for some time and
we are doing the best we can.*
â¢ "I knew why he was out of employ
ment, only too well," continued the re
porter. "1 looked at him, then at the
mother, then at the babies. I told him
I was sent to inquire about the chil
dren, a rumor being they had been
poisoned by tainted milk. And I got
out as soon as I could possibly get out.
Then I 'phoned to the city editor that
I couldn't land the story. My con
science did not disturb me a bit."
Sentiment has little place in the daily
grind of the average newspaper work
er. The toiler in the ranks is bound
by a stern law of "get there" and can
stir from the straight path of duty
only with peril of disgrace hanging
over him. But there are times when
the circumstances tempt strongly,
when a sidestep might bring to some
wretched mortal a glimmer of hope. So
it was in the story that follows:
"I was detailed one might to find a
man who had been accused of a serious
breach of trust," said a veteran news
paper reporter. "After much difficulty
I Ideated him. at his residence in the
Mission. It was very late, nearly mid
night, and I had only a few minutes
leeway to get my story in time for the
paper. Without this man's statement,
the story could not be. published. I
knew that well. He did not.

The development of Alaska is a matter of great inter
est to the United States. At the present time we are
losing a considerable number of ourÂ« pioneer class of
citizens by emigration to the Canadian northwest and to
the Klondike, and yet we have in Alaska ample room for
the exercise of the energies of all of our people of that
kind, not only for this but for the coming generation. In
order to hold them to their native allegiance, it is evi
dently necessary that they be fully informed of the man
ifold advantages Alaska holds for them. '"It is of course
right and proper that the agricultural possibilities of the
country be exploited and published, but at the same time
it is not to be overlooked that the most potent attraction
, of Alaska for settlers and for capitalists is the immense
and .varied opportunities it offers for gold mining.
In one important respect the Governor's interest in
agriculture is wise. Mo country can be permanently
prosperous unless it can support its population on a scale
of comfort equal to the best civilization of the time. -It
cannot do that unless it has ample agricultural wealth.
It appears that Alaska has that wealth in potentiality.
The miners and the men engaged in the fisheries will not
have hereafter to import all their food products. Enough
can be grown in the Territory itself to support a popula
tion sufficient to develop its mineral wealth. It is worth
while having that fact made plain at St. Louis, and from
the earnestness with which the task has been undertaken
by -Governor Brady and the lady manager, Mrs. Hart, it
seems quite likely the Alaskan exhibit will be one of the
most notable at the exposition, carrying with it a sur
prise for well nigh everybody.
GOVERNOR BRADY of Alaska, in the course of
an interview with a representative of The Call,
on the exhibit which the Territory will make at
the St. Louis exposition, gave a marvelous showing of
the agricultural resources and products of that far north
ern land, which most people believe to be a frozen waste
of ice and snow. He also spoke much of the fisheries
and the fur industry, saying comparatively little about the
mines, evidently for the purpose of making clear to the
public that Alaska has a variety of resources and is not
'to be looked upon as a mere mining camp.
The intent of the Governor was excellent, but while
an exhibit of the agricultural products of Alaska may be
pleasing to the public as a curiosity of nature, the great
popular intcrecst in Alaska, is centered in the gold dis
tricts and in the marvelous output of gold that has
come from the placer claims, where fortunes arc in reach
of men of moderate means. At the present time there is
on exhibit in this city a display of Alaskan nuggets,
which is more attractive and more instructive to the
average man than any possible display of Alaskan grain
or vegetables could be.
The w'orld is interested mainly in gold. It was the de
sire for gold that led to the upbuilding of civilization in
California and in Australia fifty years ago, and which
draws adventurous men. to the hcits of Africa and the
frozen wildernesses of Alaska to-day. The fact that
grasses can be profitably grown in the "Nome district is
but a little thing in public estimation to the fact that the
same district is the richest placer mining ground now
known to^thc world. /
ALASKA'S EXHIBIT.
Some of the theatrical managers of Chicago believe
that they arc victims of injustice in being forced to close
their showhouses until they are absolutely safe. A list
of these men should be published everywhere and the
public should be persuaded that under no possible condi
tion of time or locality should their entertainments be
patronized. Even in this age of commercialism human
life has some value.
JIany painters have aspired to ths
honor of painting the new. Pope's first
portrait, but to a French artist has
fallen the prize. According to "The
London Globe," M. Gabriel Ferrier won
the gold medal at the last Salon with a
picture of "JIary "Weeping Over the
Dead Christ," and Pius X inquired from
one of the staff of the French Embassy
the name of the painter, after seeing a
small reproduction of the work. This
led to M. Ferrier's commission. The
Pope gave the artist many sittings, and
the sketch is now almost complete,
though a few more touches axe still re
quired. M. Ferrier has elected to paint
what may be described as a state por
trait, with the Pontifical throne and thÂ»
tiara. One detail of a personal nature is
of much Interest. Though the face of
Pius X is full of. benevolence, M. Fer
rier, In all the lengthy sittings and con
versations accorded to him, never ones
saw a smile upon it.
The Pope's Portrait.
When 1 first sighted him his tusks
were resting on the ground, as he was
leisurely mating grass. He presented a
niapnific^nt :-ight as he stood there like
m. colossus with six heavy columns sup-
P'-itins: hip huge body. He had turned
round crosswise upon his trail, and
there he stood in all his majesty flap
ping off the flics with his big ears. I
got around to his back and then made
straight for him; got up to within fifty
yards; cut a Quarter circle almost
round to his side; kneeled down on one
knee, resting my jam on the other,
tÂ«x>k steady aim and fired. He came
down. I opened my sun to fill the
empty chamber and had a lot of
tremble in getting out the brass shell,
it .had expanded so. I knew that he
v.as trying to get up, for there was a
big commotion In his direction, but the
tshHl had stuck fast. It seemed an age
before 1 pot loaded up again. When I
looked toward my elephant he had got
<>n his feet, and bad turned around,
facing me, and looked at me for an
eternal moment. Ho was furiously
mad, for his tu^ks had half broken his
neck in falling and in Retting up. He
was coming at me. I cocked both bar
rels and before he had taken many
steps fired at his trunk low enough
down to cut it off if possible. I knew
the front brain shot too well to try it
under the circumstances. Both barrels
went off at almost the sarm time, and
the violent concussion was more than I
could stand. I scarcely knew what had
happened until some one picked me
up and I heard the natives beginning to
howl. "Bunprue que, bungue que" â that
is to say, "White man dead."
But Bungue was not dead, and gath
ering myself together I went to take a
look at my big elephant. I never for
a moment doubted he was dead. When
I srot to the p'.ace where he had been
shot, and where he ought to have been
lying, I could not see clearly, as my
glasses had been broken into a hundred
pieces, and the blood was streaming
down into my eye. Wiping it away and
looking hard I tried to find my ele
phant, but no elephant was there. I
got on his trail, expecting to find him
every second; but c-n going a few hun
dred yards I" began to realize he had
got away. Then I commenced to find
out the extent of my damages. The
heavy charges had broken the stock of
my gun at the grip, and the rr-eoil
caused the hammer to hit me in the
forehead just above the eye, nearly
cutting through the" skull. The blood
was running down qiy faee In a stream.
I gi/t my wound bandaged and started
back to camp a sick and discouraged
man. I inwardly vowed never again
to go on an elephant hunt. I staggered
like :i drunken man, feeling: at every
step that I must surely have to give
up going to camp and r ly where I was.
.^bout 10 o'clock at night I reached my
journey's end and l2y down on my bed.
I did not sleep much for thinking of
ihat elephant. The next day I was
joo tick to go after Mm, but on the
following day my blood was up. and
*ftrr tying my gun together. I resolved
to find him. I was afrai^. that no c-ne
would believe wliat large elephants we
have out here unless I could produce
About 3 o'clock we came upon the
LraiL I could put my two feet, one in
front of the other, in the tracks which
he had made, and soon I found where
ho had been resting his tusks on the
cround. The chase became very excit
ing: any one following the trail and
seeing how he had plowed his way
thn-ugh the bush would have known he
was a prize. I followed him until 12
o'clock, and then sat down to a hasty
lunch of buffalo tongue and cold sweet
potatoes. My men wanted to return
hemp, saying it was "yangora mangy,"
that is, a long way. I said: "There is
no setting back until we have found
that elephant/* So wo started out on
his trail once mere, following it hotly
for a l"ns time, until we came to an
ojÂ»en- place with a few b:s trees in it
and grass no more than knee-high. I
was just thinking what a fine place
that would be tw interview an elephant,
wh<Mi my men. who were ahead of me,
came back on the run. saying that they
had come up to his lordship in an
â¢ 'pon grass pitiin a little distance be
yond.
One morning when I was at Rafla a
native came- to me and told me of an
enormous elephant near his village
which tlie men had been trying to kill
for a long time, but which was so big
and strong that he always got away In
epite of all the epcar wounds they co-uld
give him. He could not, however, go
fast on account of his tusks, which
were so large that he could not carry
them far without setting them on the
Cround to rest his head on them â the
tusks serving the same purpose as the
legs of a table. He told me all this
with excited speech and gesticulations,
soing through aJl the motions of the
elephant as his tusks plowed the
ground or formed pillars for the sup
port of his head. I thought at first he
whs lying to me and merely wanted to
pet me to the village to kill him some
nii'at. Hut I decided tnat such a de
scription cÂ«ru!<I not be altogether a
thing <<f the imagination; so I loaded
some heavy brass shells, putting twen
ty-three grams of powder and 160 grams
of lead into each. This was a heavier
charge than I had been using, but this

To-day one has but to go through Kou

Fifty years ago it would have been thought fantastic
and preposterous in any one to predict that we would be
come, exporters of citrus fruits, olive products,' figs, pome
granates, raisins, grapes and wines. But we produce
and export them in such quantity as to affect the world's
markets and control our own. And now we Â¦ are pre
paring to turn our dreariest desert into a date orchard,
by creating upon its blear surface oases that will grow
the choicest date of commerce. Their habitat is the
tropical Sahara. That they will grow here is settled by
the most reliable observation, and by actual experi
ment. So it may not be a wild prophecy to predict that
fifty years from now California will be an exporter of
rubber and that the value of the gum by that time will
make it the most profitable of our products. Men now
living may wear garments or use wheel tires of Califor
nia rubber.
There are several varieties of the rubber ficus. We
have gi owing in California, as a quite common outdoor
tree, a very close congener, which we call the rubber
tree. It is made ornamental by its large oblate and
shiny leaves. On the west coast of Central and South
America the true rubber tree flourishes. Those familiar
with physical geography know that the Pacific coast of
the tropical Americas docs not share the lurid tropical
conditions that prevail in the same latitude on the cast
coast. The west coast conditions may be said to vary
from tropical to semi-tropical types. They do not differ
in a marked degree from the physical characteristics of
California. The palms, that share the forests with the
rubber ficus, grow here. The orange, a distinctly tropi
cal tree, the native of moist swamps, is domesticated
with us. and flourishes. Why not the rubber tree?
Experiment would cost so little that some one should
make it with the rubber tree. We grow the tea plant, and
would produce tea for the whole country, except for
the lack of that form of labor which would make it profi
table. In the case of rubber the labor question offers no
impediment. Granted that the tree will grow here, and
yield gum unimpaired in quantity and quality, it would
be a lasting resource of wealth, greater than any other
related to the soil. The ornamental ficus we have grows
in the natural rubber forests, and perhaps is a yicldcr of
gum. We do not know whether it has been tested here.
But the fact that it flourishes in our climate is evidence
that the rubber tree would also.
In view of these facts, it becomes of importance to
know where the rubber tree may be grown, and the Ag
ricultural Department at Washington may well interest
itself in the matter. The tree is allied to the fig, and is
classed as a, ficus. Those familiar with our ordinary fig
tree know that when the bark is punctured a milky fluid
exudes, which upon exposure becomes viscous by evapo
ration. That fluid, which is the sap of the plant, in every
respects resembles the milk of the rubber tree when it
first leaves the tree. The milk of the rubber, however,
possesses greater viscosity, and evaporates into the
familiar gum withouj: much loss of bulk.
The progress of art has vastly increased the use of
rubber. In the beginning it was used only for over
shoes and rain coats. Before the discovery of vulcan
izing bj' Goodyear, these articles had no wide use, be
cause the gum was soft and sticky in warm weather, and
brittle to breaking in cold. But Goodyear's process rev
olutionized the whole trade, in fact created it. Since
then the application of the gum to new and necessary
uses has been so rapidly extended that the world would
not know what to do without it. We have seen the
steady advance in the value of copper, due to the very
recent extension of the applications of electricity. But
that advance is eclipsed by rubber, the non-conductor of
electricity. Its first use as a -wheel tire for bicycles was
soon extended to wagons and carriages, and now, a
bugg^y or carriage without a rubber tire is becoming the
exception. The multiplication of automobiles, a ma
chine that is here to stay, has made another extensive
demand.
It is only recently that much attention has been given
to rubber planting. Only a few of, the plantations in any
part of the world have begun to yield, and- by the time
they are all in action the price of the product .will have
largely advanced. So far no substitute for rubber has
been discovered in nature nor invented by science.
Some patents for such substitutes have been taken out
in this country and in Europe, but that they were, not
practical is shown by their non-appearance in the mar
ket.
Wr ILD RUBBER, or that taken from the
native tree growing in the forest, is de
â¢ creasing evefy , year. This is due to a van/
ety of causes, among which forest fires hold first place.
Then, too, in such forests the taking of the rubber is
done by natives Who use no care in preserving the life of
the tree. Tapping becomes a girdling process, of course
with fatal results. Instead of any increase in the supply
of "wild rubber," to keep up with the constantly increas
ing demand, we have price affected by decrease in sup
ply.
King Dan really did try. with the
result that in a very few minutes the
poor old fellow was in the dispensary,
receiving treatment for a pair of badly
blackened eyes, a split lip, a bruised
nose and several black marks about
the body.
Tom. with his little eyes twinkling
i..errily, and without a mark on his
wrinkled vjsage, sat upon a soap box
in his room. About him were dozens
of gray-bearded old fellows offering
him their congratulations. In the midst
of it all the c!l fellow arose, and tak
ing from his pocket a worn, old pocket
book, abstracted therefrom a news
paper clipping, yellow with age. Care
fully unfolding it he spread it upon the
floor, and pointed with pride to the
picture of a fine, sturdy young fellow
in^ Tins costume. Placing a bent and
trembling forefinger upon the picture,
he said:
"That's me. Fifty years ago." '
A few weeks ago there arrived at the
almshouse a crabbed old fellow whom
the driver of the ambulance called Dan.
He was cranky and crotchety and
bossified to boot and he had been an
inmate of the institution but three days
when the other paupers unanimously
voted him king of the poorhouse. His
word became law, especially after he
had enforced it with a blow, and he
fairly reveled in the things called lux
uries out at the county farm. The little
box that stood at the head of his bed
â¢was filled almost to overflowing with
choice cuts of chewing tobacco and
cigar butts of extra length.
One day when King Dan had been In
power about a month the ambulance
brought out a little weazened old fel
low, who passed by the name of Tom.
In due course of time Tom and Dan
met, and 'the King let Tom know In
very short order that he was expected
to pay tribute. But Tom did not take
kindly to the suggestion, especially
when Dan demanded three-fourths of
his plug of navy.
"Not a bite," auoth Tom.
"I'll have all of it for that," growled
Dan.
"Take it."
"I will."
After Fifty Years.
The great big elephants, each nearly
eleven feet at the shoulders, were
standing there pulling grass with their
trunks and beating the mud from it
against their legs, and after rocking
it, like a child being put to sleep, in
the cradle of their trunks, they swung
it into their mouths. They were wag
ging their heads from side to side,
while their big round ears, five feet in
diameter, were waving about as though
swung on a pivot. An African ele
phant's brain is almost impossible to
locate from his forehair. I had missed
that shot so often that I had no con
fidence in It. They walked away about
eighty yards, when one of them grew
restless. He had a scent of something
irregular, out went his big ears at
right angles and up went his trunk.
While he was turning to locate the
smell I touched the trigger, and my
old gun thundered out its sentence of
death, nearly knocking me over, /as I
did not have a solid footing.
Making the natives stay behind, all
except my gun-bearer and trackers, I
was soon abreast of the quarry. The
breeze was strong in our favor, carry
ing the scent toward us. I crept
through the grass and swampy low
land, in what a state of excitement and
suspense may be imagined. I was try
ing to keep a little knoll on which
fome date palms grew between me and
the elephants, and after much effort I
arrived there. I crawled in between the
leaves, regardless of stickers, and rest
ed a second without looking out on the
other side. The excitement and ner
vous strain had lasted nearly half an
hour. When I peered out from the
covering the date leaves there were
the three big elephants so close
that I could sec every wrinkle in
thoir hides, and almost count the
hairs in their tails. Their rumps
were toward me, which was a
good thing for my nerve; it would have
been too great a strain to have faced
all three at once. My heart was throb
bing so that I could hear it, yet out
wardly I kept a' cool front. I could
not handle my gun, however, in this
state; hauling: myself through the mud
at double Quick time was exhausting.
my classes were not clear, for they
had been in the dew as veil as the rest
of mo, and there was not a dry thing
to wipe them on. At last I thought
of the leather band inside my hat and
used that. After a few moments of this
diversion I was cool all the way
through and ready to commence the
duel.
Suddenly, as if it were the raising of
a curtain on the stage, every vestige
of the mist disappeared, and I was
scanning the low grass lands for ele
phants, but there was not even an ante
lope in sight. I went on up river half
a mile farther. We crossed a gully in
the ridge, wading the swamp waist
deep, and as we came to the top of the
ridge, again there was a sight to make
a hunter forget any predicament. Some
1.00 yards up river were the three ele
phants.
Soon my glasses were on them, and I
saw they were all tuskers, and good
ones.
Sleepily, and feeling like a martyr, I
crawled out of my bunk one cold fall
morning as reluctantly as a man can
feel under such conditions. The natives
were clamoring at my door, saying,
"Demby Creecy, Deraba Creecy, duree
otta yacco yangora pepy." They had
found three elephants not far â¢ off.
After much questioning I learned that
the elephants were in> the low grass
along the banks of the river. The
water had been high and it was miry
there in many places, but since the
water had sone down the grass had
grown waist high, and this was what
attracted the elephants. Back of this
low land was a grassy ridge. I was
soon following along this with my big
gun. and before walking half a mile I
was as wet as though I had been wad
ing neck deep in the river. The dew
was cold, and the men's teeth were
chattering in spite of their efforts to
keep warm. The sun was just peeping
up now, and the heavy mist lay on the
bottom land like a soft, fleecy blanket,
obscuring the whole scene.
his tusks in evidence. I was deter
mined to find him even if I had to con
tinue the search for four months, but
after a fortnight, just as I was pre
paring to gd back to Rafla for rations,'
I was saved all further trouble by hav
ing the natives come and tell me that
they had found my beast. I- lost no
time in going to see him. but he was
in a very advanced state of decomposi
tion. The tusks, however, were intact.
They are now in my collection in Amer
ica, and can speak for themselves. .
American soil as to become thoroughly, imbued with its
, traditions to cut all home ties and pack their families to
a tropical land upon a strange continent where utterly
unfamiliar conditions both of agriculture and society ob
tain. Not only are the colonists to Liberia thrown upon
these new and untoward circumstances, but they are
brought face to face with climatic conditions which affect
them as seriously as if their forefathers, five generations
removed, had not lived in the jungle. Africa is no more
suited for the American negro than for the American
white man. Tradition will not furnish him health,
wealth and happiness.
Emigration to Liberia had a worthy beginning. When,
in the year 1811, the American Colonization Society con
ceived the laudable purpose of sending back to the Dark
Continent those freed or run-away slaves who found the
South only as darkest Egypt was to the chosen of
Lord, they planted seed on fertile soil and the Liberian
colony grew until it- gained the dignity of an independ
ent state. Those early colonists who went there, how
ever, did so under the protection and with the assistance
of the American society. They were given financial aid
and put in the way of making for themselves comfortable
Jivings in that land.
Conditions have changed now. Those who were
fortunate enough to get to the new land first have taken
up all of the finest opportunities, organized their trade
reflations and have their society based upon principles of
their own evolving. The milk of human kindness does
not spout more plentifully on the west coast of Africa
than in any other portion of the globe. The Liberians
have ceased to welcome penniless immigrants, and ac
cordingly negro colonists from the United States find
on their arrival a far from hospitable reception.

INSTRUCTIVE STUDIES

WOMEN
TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMESToo much father-in-lavf is what trou
bles Wllllaml W. Flagler, who deals
in paints and oils, but who overlooked
a bet in not claiming to be a nephew
of Henrv M. Flagler of the Standard
Oil Company. His father-in-law is
named Michael Savage and the old
gentleman, retired from business after
amassing a competency, lives at 438
Clementina street. ;
Flagler married Savage's daughter
one year ago and the silver cord was
severed Friday in their first matri
monial row. The wife tore off her wefl
ding'ring. threw it into the fireplace
and rushed to tho only rescue she had,
liie telephone. She ; called up her
John Dowd, an elderly man. who is
accused of cruelty to a minor child,
appeared in Judge Fritz's court yes
terday. The abused infant is 'his
daughter, aged 17 years. His wife
is a witness in the case and it may
require several hearings to develop
the real facts.
Dowd has made a wreck of a house
he tflaims to own at Harriet and Har
rison streets. When he wa3 arrested
on a charge of disturbing the peace
the policeman found that nearly all
the panels of the doors in eighteen
rooms had been kicked out. His wife
says she owns the premises and that
she is not in the wrecking business.
In addition he is accused of using his
brawny fist on the protruding jaw of
any member of the family that op
posed his frequent excursions to the
corner grocery to crown a tin pail
with amber and foam. When he was
arrested a horse bucket filled with
beer was alongside his bed.
B. Cohn is a man who peddles liz
ards around the streets with a pin
skewered through their insides./When
the Florida lizards are' properly im
paled they give splendid color effects.
Then they die in torture on the bos
oms of the women who wear them,
after a period of six or seven days.
Cohn was in court yesterday.
Cohn was charged with the offense
of peddling without a license. The
charge of cruelty to animals was lost
in the shuffle. Policeman Dan Dris
coll testified that Cohn often block
aded the front of Market-street stores,
vending his living wares, cruelly stab
bed as. they were.
Cohn made a poor witness for him
self and a poorer advocate before
Judge Mogan yesterday. He was ad-
Judged guilty of peddling without a
license and will be sentenced Monday.
Victor Lavart, like the French lyric
poet Beranger, cares not who makes
the laws of a country if he can write
its songs. He is a poet, with abundant
hair on his whiskers and the generally
unwashed appearance of one who dab
bles in versifying to excess. He was
before Judge Mogan yesterday on a
charge of vagrancy.
Policeman George Duffy testified that
his duties were seriously interfered
with in patrolling the vicinity of Jeffer
son square by being forced to hunt the
poet through the shrubbery and around
the trees at night time. So insistent
was Lavart in making a lodging-house
of the public square that he disregarded
more than fifty warnings by the police
man.
The poet approached Judge Mogan
closely and tried to whisper a few
winged words into his ear. In the
course of police business the Judge has
forgotten almost all the poetry he ever
knew. "Just stand down there," he
said, "and tell me all about it."
Lavart told him that poets and
prophets read their stories from the
stars, and that in the narrow confines
of his bunk on Washington street he
could get no inspiration. He needed the
blue vault of heaven and the twinkling
of the constellations to give him the
proper half-Nelson on eternal truths
that should be ambered in verse.
He was convicted of vagrancy, and
Monday he will be given thirty days in
a. resort on the San Jose road, where
he may gaze at the cerulean vault of
heaven as it appears banded and barred
by the windows of the bastile that
holds him.
The disagreement of the jury that
recently heard the trial of the suit
of J. H. McCarty agaist the Master
Horseshoers' Association and the
Journeymen Horseshoers* Union does
not suit McCarty. Yesterday he filed
notice that on January 29 he will
move that the court set a date for an
other trial of the action.
McCarty Will Try Again.
September he became acquainted with
Kelly and got him to sell some of the
stolen jewelry. Walters subsequently

GARXETT'S ATTORNEY ASKS

Present at Trial. â¢

murder of Major J. W. McClung in the
apartments of Mrs. Lillian Hitchcock-
Coit at the Palace Hotel, to set aside
the Information was commenced before
Judge Lawlor yesterday 1 and will be
continued on Tuesday, jj
Grady spoke for nearly' four hours
on innumerable technical points. He
argued ' that 'the testimony given by
Mrs. Colt.at the.Coroner's inquest was
different in esential particulars to that
given by her at the preliminary exarrf^
ination before Police Judge Fritz. Other
points raised were to the effect that Il
legal continuances had been granted in
the Police Court, and that Mrs. Colt
was not in a proper state mentally to
testify.'
Grady claimed that it was - essential
to, the defendant's interests that the
trial be postponed until Mrs. Colt's at-"
tendance could.be secured. He had not
concluded his argument when a contini
vuance.till Tuesday was ordered.

Ringleader, Who Was Formerly

Is Caught in Minneapolis
?
Three bellboys whom the police [
claim are implicated in the theft of
Baroness von Â¦ Horst's diamonds and
other jewelry of the value of $3000 j
from her rooms at the Colonial Ho
tel, Pine and Jones streets, on the j
evening of January 6 or the morning |
of January 7, are in custody, one in j
Minneapolis and two here. They are
J. M. Walters, George Kelly and John
Mills.
Detectives Dinan and Wren have
been working on the case and their
suspicions, which fell upon the three
boys, were confirmed when they dis- i
covered that Kelly a,nd Mills had been j
disposing of some of the stolen jewel- j
ry here. This the officers recovered.
Kelly and Mills were placed under
arrest and it was le-arned by the of
ficers that Walters had left this city
on January 12 for the North by way j
of Seattle. J
Circulars were at once prepared,
giving- an accurate description of Wai- j
ters and containing a description of j
the stolen jewelry. Yesterday morn- i
ing Chief Wittman received a dispatch
from Ed J. Conroy, Superintendent of
Police, Minneapolis, Minn., that Wal
ters had been arrested there and that
the police had in their possession six
of the stolen articles of jewelry, which
Walters had sold there for $70/
Superintendent. Conroy was at once
notified to hold Walters and that an I
officer would be sent immediately with j
the necessary papers for his extradi
tion. The papers were at once pre
pared and Detective Dinan was in
structed to be in readiness to proceed i
to 'Sacramento to have them signed;
by the Governor and .then continue j
his journey to Minneapolis to bring j
Walters back. Baron von Horst was j
communicated with and he swore to j
the warrant for Walters' arrest on a ;
charge of grand larceny before Police
Judge Mogan. j

here last September after stealing j
about $5000 worth of jewelry from the

MAUDE LAWRENCE PURGED
OF THE CHARGE OF FORGERY
Maude Lawrence was dismissed yes
terday by Judge Cabaniss, the charge
that she forged the name of J. Walter
Laymance to certain paper calling for
money from the Columbian Banking:
Company having failed of proof. All
the evidence showed that the checks in
dispute were Issued by Laymance, and
even the bank officials had acumen
enough to pass the alleged forged or
ders and give in exchange lawful money
of the United States.
Judge Cabaniss at three different
epochs of the hearing yesterday inti
mated that the defendant would be dis
missed. The attorney for the prosecu
tion was insistent on making an argu
ment, however, and before he had half
finished the cause was lost.
"We have wished to show," said the
attorney, "that Mr. Laymance has been
pursued by this woman for years and
that his entire desire was to be rid of]
her."
The Judge interrupted with the per
tinent question: "If Mr. Laymance
really desired to be rid of this woman
why did he go to meet her at the Bay
State in response to a telephone mes
sage on her return from New York,
after their intimacy had been severed
for a number of years?"
During the course of the decision ren
dered by Judge Cabaniss allowing the
defendant her liberty he inadvertently
referred to the charge against her as
"perjury." The special prosecutor
promptly corrected him and stated that
the charge was forgery. Attorney Tom
O'Connor for the defense leaned over
the rail and said audibly, "Perjurjrwill
be the charge against Laymance."
O'Connor refused to say later whether
or not charges of perjury would be pre
ferred against Laymance. He said it
was a matter still under consideration.
He frankly stated, however, that a. civil
damage suit would be brought against
' John H. Swift, president of the Colum
bian Banking Company, who swore to
the complaint against the woman de
! fendant, who remained In the City
i Prison three days before bail was se
i cured for her. Laymance and the do
; lumbian Banking Company will be
j made codefendants in the civil suit for
', damages.

BY THE FUKXCII ALLIANCE
A short programme of first-class
ballads and music has been arranged
to precede the lecture, which will be
held in the Alhambra Theater on next
Wednesday evening. Carrie Roma
will appear In the best Irish melodies
and there will also be readings from
the choicest of Yeats* poems and
dramas. He will lecture at Berkeley
University on Wednesday and at Stan
ford on Friday. Mr. Yeats* stay will
be very brief, as he has engagements
in the East prior to his return to Ire
land. Tickets for his lecture may be
had at room 87, Flood building.
William Butler Yeats, the distin
guished young poet and orator of the
Celtic revival, will receive an 'enthu
siastic reception in San Francisco.
Seldom has the visit of a man of let
ters been expected with such deep in
terest. The Irish race regards him as
its great leader and representative in
the world of letters. Those who have
read his works or the comments of the
t ritics wish to see and hear the young
prophet of the mystic literature of the
Celt.

I am not* going to talk about the arttetfc
and educational value Â»f municipal Improve
ment. I am talklne on the money value of
beauty as applied to city life. Take Union
Square as a practical example. The location
and Â«oil are' no better now than they have
alawys been, but every parcel of property
facing: the nquare has advanced many thou
sands In sclllns Price, because some enterpris
es public spirited citizens erected a monu
ment in the center of it and the city authori
ties put the care of th? square into the hands
of the Pnrlc Commission and under Super
intendent McLaren's Â«ur>*rvlsion. Both move
ments Rave raid we IK in dollars and cents,
and so will every other atttmpt to better con
ditions here.
The whole intent cf the model city is to
show metropolitan and civic activities Instead
of raw product*. I>os Angeles and Seattle are
each bidding for public favor. One aims at
the tourist trade and the other lays claim to
being the greatest shipping pofnt on the coast.
We have only to make the efMSrt to hold our
supremacy, but we cannot afford to be unrep

Now the finance committee does n^t wish
to resort to hegsln* and coaxing the business.

the funds needed. This is not a case of help
ing anybody bÂ»t them^lves. It will pay In
every sense of the word to make the exhibit

pealed to directly should answer as promptly
as nosslbie and as eenerously as they can.
San Francisco Is just hsirinnlnn to wake up

PLAN TO REPRODUCE UNION FERRY
DEPOT AT THE ST. LOUIS EXPOSITION
No Difficulty in Raising
of Funds Is Ex
pected.
Space Allotted in Attract
ive Part of World's
Fair Grounds.
â¢ Frederick H. Colburn, assistant sec
retary and manager of the San Fran
cisco exhibit at the St. Louis World's,
Fair, has received a telegram from
Howard J. Rogers, who is acting In the
place of Secretary Reeves during the
temporary absence of the latter, which
states that satisfactory space for a
San Francisco building has been re
served. The telegram urges Mr. Col
burn to forward the designs as soon
as possible and states that further In
structions will be sent by mail. v
WÂ« will need only $50,000 to carry out tat
entire plan and there Is 120,000 in tight now.
All I ask Is that ths business men of this city
shall understand exactly what the finance and
display committees are trying to do.
CHOICE IiOCATIOX.
In the first place San Francisco li the only
Pacific Coast city that is invited to erect a
building: In the model street, which is situated
at tho main entrance to the fair grounds and is
four blocks Ions. Next to It Is the Pike, or
Midway, with all its novelties and attractions,
and the exposition managers are determined
that the model street shall be one of the
greatest features of the fair. It will be Im
possible to pass through the main entranoa
without seeing the San- Francisco building.
The projected San Francisco build
ing will cost $50,000. Of this the Super
visors have agreed to appropriate
$15,000, an* the remainder can easily
be raised by popular subscription. The
banks, real estate firms and other
large corporations are already sending
in large contributions. It is planned
to model the structure after the new*
ferry depot.
"The chance of her municipal life

9/8- 322 MARKET Â£TTHE foreign competition In export trade crows fiercer. All the
leading countries of the world are working for a larger share
of the export trade. This Is no mere assertion. No one who
reads the commercial reports, the official statements and the
popular literature of the business nations of the world can fail to
notice the increased competition in export trade. The American
people have standardized their bnsiness interests, have raised the
efficiency of their manufacturing plants, have multiplied their trans
portation facilities and have taken many strides of commercial
5 progress. And yet the consular service dealing directly with export
trade is ruled by laws nearly fifty years old. In order to keep
pace with our own commercial progress, in order to offset the ag
gressive action of forel&rn traders, the American Government must
raise its consular service to a higher standard of efficiency, a stand
ard that may only be reached th* rough recognition of merit and in
dependent selection. â From report of William M. Bunker, Washington
representative of the Chamber o f Commerce.
PRESIDENT OF THE SAN FRANCISCO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, WHO PRESIDED AT THE ANNUAL BAN
QUET GIVEN BY THAT ORGANIZATION LAST NIGHT AT THE PALACE HOTEL, AND TWO OF THE
PROMINENT SPEAKERS. :
Continued on Page 37, Column l.
Continued on' Pazc 37, Column 1.
Frank Batturs, who leaves Tuesday
for New Orleans, where he is to take
thÂ« position of assistant general pas
pengor agent of the Southern Pacific
Company's Atlantic system, was sur
rounded yesterday by the chiefs and
attaches of the local passenger depart
ment as he was about to leave the of
fice and' presented wjth a beautiful
giold watch, fob and seal.
The tok*>n of esteem from his old
associates was presented to him by
General Passenger Agent T. H. Good
man, who, in a short speech, referred
to Batturs' rise in the service of the
Southern Pacific Company and his ap
preciated ability as a rate clerk.
Passenger Traffic Manager E. O.
McCormick also paid a tribute to Bat
turs and joined with those present in
wishing him success in his future fields
of labor. 'Â¦-, -'-\~~.-
To-morrow evening the passenger
snen of thÂ»* other railroad offices in

and influential part in the new period
of our country's commercial develop
ment. . I know it is fully alive to its
opportunities and is utilizing the nat
ural advantages of the great resources
of the Pacific Coast to make San Fran
cisco the entrepot of Asiatic and isles
of- the Pacific trade, as New York la In
the Atlantic Ocean."
After the reports of the president, the
secretary and Commissioner Bunker
had beeri, read, the chairman introduced
Frank J. Symmes, president of the
Merchants' Association, who delivered
a very happy address.
WHAT MR. SYM3EES SAID.
There were flashes of epigram In the
remartcs of the speaker. "Your field,"
he said, addressing President Newhall;
"is the world; ours is. tne city. The
task of the Merchants' Association, is
to keep San Francisco's streets clean.
When that is accomplished it may
clean the City Hall. But, after all,
perhans-the work of the Merchants'
Association is the greater one. The re
cent action of the City Board of Health
in removing employes without regard to
the civil service may have been indica
tive of what was planned for other de
partments, and. I am glad to have been
assured by the health board that it did
not intend to violate the law."
Mr. Symmes then expressed the
opinion that South America offers a
vast field for San Francisco's mercan
tile enterprise. The trade down there
is controlled by England and Germany,
but California could obtain a profitable
share of 1 1 by going after it in the
proper way. .
GOVERNOR BRADY TAUK.S.
The chairman then called upon Gov
ernor John G. Brady of Alaska to ad
dress the assemblage,' and the grizzled
territorial executive got a very hearty
reception when he arose In response.
He told of Alaska's business experience
and home life, and when he incidentally
mentioned that five children had been
born to him In the far north, President
Newhall occasioned a* laugh by remark
ing that he was ; the sort of a man
President Roosevelt is proud of. After
reviewing Alaska's history to consid
erable length, the Governor spoke
glowingly of the territory's resources.
He emphasized the statement -that
Alaska's /wealth lies in the certainty
of its moisture. The fisheries alone, he
declared, yielded enough income last
year to equal the original sum paid
by. the United States to Russia for the
territory. : Then he boldly accused San
Francisco of . slumbering and allowing
Seattle to grab; the trade of Alaska;
and the accusation, so. far from being
resented, evoked applause.
GEXERAL CHIPMAX'S IDEAS.
General X.' P. Chipman. president of
the State: Board of Trade, talked of
the valuable resources of Northern
California and what Is being done to
advertise them. The people of the
East, he said, are Just beginning to
understand and appreciate the desir
able home-making facilities that ex
ist in Central and Northern Califor
nia. . . .
President A. Sbarboro of the Man
ufacturers' and Producers'. Associa
tion .discussed . the, wine. industry. He
said' the art of aging wine had been
mastered in this" State, and that Is
one cause of the great success that is
now following viticulture. ; California
wines ore growing in favor abroad,
and the pure food law recently passed
by Congress is keeping out much adul
terated vintage from France and Ger
many and correspondingly populariz
ing the California product 'In the
East. ; Sixty, per cent of the French
wines sent to this country never came
from a vineyard, he asserted. "and Cal
ifornia is -supplying the world with
wines that cannot be beaten for pur
ity.. -â¢.
"Not champagne," suggested Pres
ident .Newhall. .- <
- v Not.'yet,'V was the auick answer. '
FOR3EER PRESIDEXT CRAIG.
Hugh Craig, a former president of
the .Chamber of Commerce, reviewed
the history of the organization and
told of some of the good works per
formed - by 1 it. He spoke of the time
when Market street, was a toll road
and when many of the wharves were
owned by private corporations, and
then he deplored the existence of what
he termed \the ' pilotage . mono_poly.
"Compulsory pilotage,"., he said, "must
be abolish*^ even at the risk of hav
ing ourselves accused of socialism, for
it Is retarding our port commerce."
Then he ; talked of the Panama canal
and : awoke ' a Â¦ hurricane of plaudits by
alluding^ to President Roosevelt '. and
Secretary Hay. as the men of the hour,
who have done whatthe civilized world
has been expecting to be done for four
centuries. He predicted an early day
when the chamber will be 'confronted
with the question of 'municipal owner
ship of water, lights and street rail
ways, and he hoped "the chamber would
face the questions manfully. - â¢
. At the conclusion of Mr. Craig's ad-
One hundred and twenty-five
members of the San Francisco Cham
ber of Commerce and a number of in
vited guests attended the seventh an
nual banquet" of that organization last
evening in the Marble room of the
Palace Hotel. It was the most repre
sentative gathering of the city's mer
cantile elements on record, nor was
there ever a more interesting series of
post-prandial talks of the subject of
trade, despite the fact that several
distinguished .gentlemen who had
promised to be present and contribute
to the oratory sent last-minute ' mes
sages of regret at inability- to fulfill
their promise.
President George A. Newhall occu
pied the center of the board and close
to him were Vice Presidents B. R. Di
mond and C. H. Bentley, Secretary E.
Scott and Trustees Frank L. Brown",
W. J. Dutton, J. A. Folger, William Lu
Gerstle, Rufus P. Jennings, "W. D.
Loveland, William H. Marston,
Thomas Richard, Jamas .Rolph Jr.,
Henry Rosenfeld. James B. Smith and
William R. Wheeler. Among the
other gentlemen flanking the president
were Professors Bernard Moses and
Carl C. Plehn of the University of
California; Charles H. Spear, presi
dent of the State Board of Harbor
Commissioners: N. P. Chipman, presi
dent of the California State Board of
Trade; Frank J. Symmes, president of
the San Francisco Merchants' Associa
tion; A. A. Watkins, president of the
Board of Trade of San Francisco; A.
Sbarboro, president of the -Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association,
and H. D. Loveland, president of the
Pacific Coast Jobbers' and Manufac
turers' Association. Governor John
G. Brady of Alaska was one of the
speakers and most interested auditors.
The banquet hall was most artistic
ally decorated and the menu was on a
par with the dinners served at the Pal
ace. From 6:30 till 9 o'clock the viands
occupied attention and then President
Newtiall opened the oratory by, wel
coming, the' guests and quoting mes
sages of regret from President Benja
min Ide Wheeler of the University df
California, President David Starr Jor
dan of Stanford University and United
States Senator George C. Perkins. The
last named wired from Washington
these words:

lations and best wishes for each mem

Men That Are Conversant With California's Mercantile Needs
and Possibilities Give Expression to Ideas.
Much Interest was manifested dur
ing tha reading of the report of Wil
liam M. Bunker, the chamber's rep
resentative. at Washington. The tell
ing points of Mr. Bunker's exhaustive
document were quickly noted and
demonstratively approved. This is
the report in full: Â«
WASHINGTON', D. C. Jan. 12, 1904.â To
the Honorable President. Board of Trustees and
Members of the Chamber of Commerce of San
Francisco â Gentlemen: The Washington Bu
reau of the chamber begins Its third year un
der flattering auspices. The finished work
speaks for Itself. The future offers larger op
portunities. The bureau Is the natural eequel
to previous prompt action by the chamber ad
ministration. It Is only one link In a long
chain of events. The past and the present
may be pertinently Joined. The broad and
strong foundations of the San Francisco com
merce A to-day were at least' partially laid
by the Chamber of Commerce of San Fran
cisco. The home record* and the files at
Washington chow that the chamber has fairly
earned Its power and prestige. The commer
cial history of California is the history of the
chamber. Chamber Initiatives have succeeded.
The chamber was the first â¢ to properly ap
praise the American-Asiatic trade. It forced
the fact* to the front. These same fact*
affect the trade Issues of to-day. The present
president of the chamber and his associated
trustees eaw the impending changes in Asiatic
trade. While -oublic men were discussing tbÂ»
effect on the Pacific Coast of th* Trans-Siberian
Railway . and were needlessly alarmed the
chamber arranged an official Inspection of the
Trans-Siberian route. It Initiated a study of
the new transportation facilities. It planned
a commercial reconnolsance of Northeastern
Asia. A* the representative of thÂ» chamber I
had the honor and the privilege of studying
commercial conditions In .China. Japan and
Siberia and later following the lines of trade
between Asia and Europe. The inquiry Into
the Asiatic trade Involved Interviews with
consular representatives and a special study
of trade In Northern China and Eastern Si
beria Public Interest centered In Northern
China and Eastern Siberia. These regions
were the . first beneficiaries of the Trans-
Siberian Railway. The records of the cham
ber ahow that Its reports of Asiatic trade
conditions were fair, full and faithful. The
Astatic demand for American breadstufCs. the
demand for American merchandise and the
results' that would follow Russian tariff
changes were discussed In detail. The neces
sity of officially' safeguarding American trade
In the Russian-Asiatic region was aggres
sively demonstrated. The several reports made
to the chamber were later circulated officially
by the Washington authorities. In view of.
the Dolitlcai and commercial, crisis in Man
. churla and the changes that threaten Ameri
can trade in Northeastern Asia It la distinctly
appropriate that the work of the chamber In
promoting, protecting and exploiting trade In
terests should be borne in mind.
The chamber went to the very foundation
of American trade with that portion of Siberia
directly, tributary to the Pacific Coast. The
facts and the figures were presented in 1S39.
Up to that time no one had taken a trade cen
sus of Eastern Siberia. In one of the reports
Issued by the chamber the commercial anJ
vital statistic* of Vladivostok. Khabarovsk,
Blagovestchensk. _ Stretylnsk and other cities
and towns of Eastern Siberia were printed In
the Englteh language for the first time. The
business of each place . was studied and
classified. The social facts relating to trade
'and figures covering the industrial activities
were, through the chamber, presented to the
American public. Incidentally the value of
consular reform was emphasized and the ad
vanced views of the chamber were fortified.
CONSULAR REFORM.
The chamber was one of the first commercial
organizations to stand for consular service re
form. The vast foreign trade of San Fran
cisco widened the horizon of this commercial
community and showed , the necessity for a
more practical consular service. The service
has been bettered>ln the last few years. The
service Is better to-day than It was a year
ago. But the service will not meet the de
mands of commerce until a consular reform
bill shall have been passed. The chief needs
of the consular service are:
' A regular graded classification, including all
salaried Consuls or Consul Generals, based on
the. amounts of salary, and so arranged as to
permit the Interchange of consular posts within
the same . grade, by order of the President
â¢tone, or advancement by promotion from
grade to grade.
The fixing of salaries for the higher grades
sufficiently adequate to encourage capable men
to enter the service as a career, and provision
for the turning of all fees received at salaried
post* Into the Government treasury, and
. The establishment of a system - of com
petitive examinations, open to all. for entrance
to -the lower grades, of transfers and promo
tion* based upon superior capacity shown in
actual service and of retention < during good
behavior. â^ â¢ . -
.As the representative of the chamber I at
tended the annual meting at Baltimore, on
the 11th ult., of the - National Consular Re
form Committee. < of which Hon. H. A. Gar
flel$ is president. - and assisted in the discus
sion of the reform measure which Congress
will bt> asked to adopt. The consular bill In
troduced by Hon. Henry Cabot Lodge. Senator
from ' Massachusetts, and the bill mtroduced
by'XTon. Robert Adams Jr., representing the
Second Pennsylvania District, were carefully
analyzed and compared. The Adams bill, as
atrtended in committee, was finally* made the
committee measure. The friends of consular
reform may be felicitated on the successful
agitation of the consular reform Issue. While
It Is true that no consular reform bill has been
passed since* 1856. â and the service lacks sys
temv the fact remains that active and as
gresslve" agitation for consular rcforn* has bet
tered the e?rvice. All tfiat may be done by
simple agitation has been done, and well done,
and. yet; the need of. consular Improvement Is
frreater to-day than- ever. The changes In
the: currents of trade Insure an Increasing de
mand .for better men in the service.
EXPORT CO3IPET1TIOX.
.'The foreign - competition in export" trade
grqws .fiercer. All the leading countries of the
world are' working for a larger share of the
'export trade.- Thla Is no mere assertion. No
one â¢who reads the- commercial reports, the of
ficial statements and the popular literature of
the business- natlops, of the world can fail to
notice the . increased competition in export
trade. The American people' have *tan<1anl
ized their business interests, have raised the
efficiency cf their manufacturing plants, have
multiplied their transportation facilities ami
have taken many strides -of commercial prog
ress. And ye.t the consular service dealing di
rectly with export trade is ruled by laws nearly
fifty years old. In order to keep pace with our
own commercial progress, f in order to ofTset
the. aggressive, action of foreign traders, the
American Government must raise Us consular
service to a higher standard of efficiency, :a
standard that may only be reached through
recognition of merit and Independent selection.
The demand for Â¦ reform . is - based on business
needs. - These needs are not â¢ of one class . and
are not limited to a few localities. - They are
especially Imperative in -British South Arrica,
where American Â¦ exports have increased from
13.000.000 to over $33,000,000 in the Uat Us
years; in Eastern Asia, with which, through
an Increasing tonnage, we are coming into
closer contact, and In many other parts of the
world. The state of affairs that permits unin
formed and untrained men to represent the
business Interests of the country In foreisn
lands Is absurdly artiaclal. In practical busi
ness life there Is an ever Increasing demand
for the highest business ability. In the con
sular service there are men who have never
had any business training, others who have
demonstrated their lack of business ability.
and others still who. for various reasons, are
barely tolerable as consular officers. As the
consular service Is a business department of
the Government and the Consuls are supposed
to do business In a business way. it follows
that only men familiar with business and who
have the business Instinct should be placed
in consular positions.
CO3IMEIICE AND LABOR.
The Chamber of Commerce of San Francueo
early advocated the creation of a new de
partment dealing directly and in a public way
with the strictly commercial affairs of the
country. The chamber memorialized Congress
In favor of. the needed department. Plans for
the creation of this new branch of the publii
service were advocated by the representative
of the chamber at Washington at hearings of
thÂ«. House Interstate and Foreign Commerce
Committee. The department has shown its
value. Scattered bureaus that formerly worked
at cross purposes have been welded Into a
symmetrical *ystem. Order has been evolved
fiom confusion. The department is operate!
on business lines. Private business in tha
active cities and towns of the Cnited States
gets no greater care than that given public
business by the new department. This Is the
general verdict. My own satisfactory experi
ence 1* an Incidental factor. The orderly ana
purposeful progress of the department may
be accepted as an earnest of future achieve
ments. The appropriation necessary to thiÂ»
proper operation of the department should be
promptly voted. Money is rieeded for special
probing of foreign markets, foreign methods
and foreign trade demands. The export tr *d
of Germany Is not based on lucky hits. That
trade Is not accidental. That trade was born
of official inquiries in foreign countries.
Trained investigators found bottom facts an.1
bottom figures. These facts and figure* wer*
scattered throughout commercial Germany.
The German traders moved in the light of
accurate Information. The American Govern
ment ha* finally organized a department to
develop American trade. Given the necessary
funds and given them promptly the Depart
ment of Commerce and Labor will be able to
stimulate foreign trade at a time when Â»uch
stimulation will advantageously affect every
part of the country. If the funds of the De
partment of Commerce and Labor a few
months since had allowed the Secretary to
send to Asia a specially arranged expedition
the expert trade of the, United State* woul.i
have been benefited to an amount larger
than the annual expenses of the foreign In
quiry division. The department has many and
varied functions. At present the various bu-
Â£ a . U K ia . r .' a Â«Â«" bll n* guiding information.
With this information domestic and foreign'
trade may be fostered, promoted and protei.:Â»d
The Pacific Coast has a special use for ths
Department of Commerce and Labor, a greater
use perhaps than any other section of the
country. This because the trade field* of tne
Pacific are without parallel
AMERICAN ASIATIC TRADE.
The Paciflc Coast line o| 13.425 mi>i is
the natural American base for Asiatic trade.
No other Western nation has an equally g*Â«i
'%tZJÂ° r * J 3 trade ; rlrcui "sta noes' have con
sr.ired in favor of the Pacific Coast. San
iranciaco haa been socially favored. It iÂ»
the duty of San Francisco and Pacific Coast
people generally to see that these favorlns
trade conditions are brousht to national at
tention. The distance from London to Shang
hai Is 10.5W miles, as against 5S41 miles from
San Francisco to Shanghai. It t 3 2100 miles
from San Francisco to Honolulu. It Is R8.V4
miles rrom San Francisco to th^ Philippines
vja. the Hawaiian Islands. San Francisco ha*
a Shanghai transportation advantage over Lon
don of 4tio9 miles. Saiv Francisco has relative
transportation advantages over London with
respect to ether Asiatic ports. These advan
tages have been made more apparent through
the annexation, and expansion peltries of the
Government. And yet neither the Government
nor the public has fully grasped the signifi
cance of'the *ituation. American public men
who have crossed the Russian empire on thÂ»
Trans-Siberian Railway In the last two year*
have sralsed the enterprise cf Russia and
have seen In the march of that emoire u>
Pacific waters a magnificent and commendable
national policy. Tbesa observing Americans
assert that Russia needs a Pacific trade base.
They do not hesitate to say that In the ab
sence of an Asiatic trade base thÂ» Russian
empire will fail to meet its manifest destiny.
They do not hesitate to say In Interviews,
addresses, books and magazines that this trad*
base must be fixed in the living present.
These views are being freely printed and
broadly circulated. If a Pacific trade base
is needed by 'Russia for the healthy exten
sion of Russian-Asiatic trade, how much mort
necessary to the Asiatic trade Interest* <Jf the
United States Is a broad and liberal policy
on the part of the American Government that
will sennit the proper and natural usa of
Pacific Coast geographical advantages In
American-Asiatic trade development. -It It
not Hear" that the American base should bÂ»
hurriedly developed? The distance from New
York to San Francisco Is 3200 miles. The
distance from Dalny. the Russian- city oC
Manchuria, to St. Petersburg Is over <S00O miles.
Â¦It Is also over 600O mites from St. Peters
burg to Vladivostok. ThÂ«uÂ» distances show
the strategic trade advantages to San Fran
cisco. The distinguished American*, more rar
tlcularly American ouhllc nvn who hav* sim
ply praised the great eastern march of Rus
sia, have missed the lesson of that march.
They. have failed to see or at least to mention
an easterly direction the American nation
marches westerly, and that in a trade sense
the two nations are makins for the ianw
point. The promotion policy pursued by Uus
sia Is more than Interesting to the American
people. It is a warning.
PACIFIC OCEAN TUADK.
The Government has an economic interest in
Pacific Ocean trade. The expansion of this
trndÂ» haa madÂ»Â» the Pacific Coast a natural
official .base. There are numerous Illustra
tions In point. They affect various branches of
the Government. The great military depot for
quartermaster stores of the United State*
army. Is at Jefferscnville. Ind.. W! miles from
New Tork and over iMfu* miles from San Fran
cisco. The depot was opened in the early part
of the Civil War. Its location at that time,
and for the next quarter of a century, sulteri
the service. Cut to-day, after a lapse of
more than forty years, after the country has
altered Â¦ its tra.l- methods, after the country
has expanded thousands of miles; In short,
after the commercial, military and population
conditions of the country have, in n?arly every
respect, changed, the purchase of supplies de
liverable at Jeffersonvllle for use In the Phil
ippines, over 9000 miles from thÂ« Jefferaonvllle
depot, is against good business 'Judgment. Most
supplies used by the army at Pacific coast
points and in the Island possessions can be
more easily and- more cheaply bought at San
Francisco an<i other Pacific coast points Una

previous year, which was supposed to be the
banner year.
The mortgages of 1903 aÂ«sresa.te $30^889.039.
while tfte releases amount to $21,346,690, thus
making the net sum borrowed $9.54o.2S9. In
other words, there was $47,710,157 invested In
Par. Francisco realty during the year and only
$9 f.43 2S9 of the total amount was borrowed,

The manufactures in San Francisco during
1903 we estimate at a little over $150,000,000
in valuation. While our customs collections
â¢how some difference, they should have'
amounted to over $9,000,000 if the duty on
coal and tea had not been removed, but they
did actually show $7,621,160.
The population of the city is steadily in
creasing and is now estimated to be between
440.000 and 450.000 people. -

STRONG efforts haTe been made to induce the War Department
to retain In San Francisco the Government transports. This,
as you all know, has been successful, and our recent advices
from Washington show that San Francisco will always receive
a rery large proportion of this business. Another matter of great
Interest to San Francisco Is the purcliasing of Government supplies
for the different governmental departments. Much correspondence
has been had with the Government hi this regard, and we are pleased
to say that our replies have been farorable, and that California,
and especially San Francisco, will receive a Just proportion of this
business. The canal subject is one that this chamber has always
taken a very active interest in, and we are pleased to say that the

in Some Good Stickr/ork at
Critical Stages of the Game
The soldier ball tossers from the Pre
sidio turned another trick yesterday
afternoon, when they drove the Jesse
Moore team to the woods after ten
rounds of the fiercest kind of baseball.
There was not a dull moment during
the entire two hours of the struggle,
and a mighty cheer went .up from the
assemblage when the boys in blue bat
ted in the winning. tallies in the tenth
round. Score 7 to 6.
Possibly the largest . crowd that ever
gathered at the Presidio athletic
grounds was on the spot when time was
called. Of course, the soldiers were the
favorites with the multitude, and every
time they made a fast play the feat
was rewarded with a deafening yell
from the men on the bleachers.
The game was marked by some heavy
hitting, fast and sensational fielding
and errors that sometimes proved cost
ly. The soldiers outhit their opponents
nearly two to one, but they 'were like
truck horses on the bases, and simply
threw away half a dozen runs during
different innings of the contest.
The Moores were first to land, coming
through with two tallies in the second
inning by three well placed hits, which
came at' just the right moment. The
soldiers made a great stand in the
third. It was then, they got the Moores
rattled for a few minutes, and after
two men had^ been put out they piled up
five tallies on half a dozen hits and a
couple of bad errors by the infield.
In their half of the fourth the Moores
got into the going good and strong.
They began to find Forsyth for a bunch
of hits, and ere the agony ended three
of the distillers made the rounds of the
sacks. This was the beginning of a
great deadlock, which remained un
broken till the soldiers batted in two
runs in the tenth round.
Two hits' and an error gave the sol
diers their two tallies and won the
game for them in the last round of the
day. The Moores were not all in at
that. With the score 7 to 5 against
them; they started in and batted a run
through in a twinkling. With two on
the bags and two gone Smith made
three mighty swings at the ball and hit
nothing, so the struggle came to an end
and the crowd seemed satisfied. The
score:

LOS ANGELES, Jan. . 23.â A good
crowd, a good'pard' that included a
stake event and - the success of the
former in selecting winners were the
most notable points of the racing to
day at Ascot. There was a hurdle race,
that furnished a surprise to the bettors
and a thrill to the feminine portion of
the crowd./ Phil Archibald; at 10 to 1.
proved . the winner. Ceylon fell at the
third jump, throwing and severely
bruising .Peters, the Jockey. Another
feature of the hurdle^ race was the poor
riding of McMahon on Poorlands and
his subsequent suspension for an in
definite period. Â«
The form players started the day
with Beautiful and B.est, but the odds
were prohibitive at 1 to 7. He won in a
gallop from Galanthus. Â¦ Landseer was
third. .
The two-year-old event sent five good
youngsters to the post. Schreibeifs
Pinkerton was a strong favorite at 1 to
2, with Durnell's entry. Lady Lasca
and Peggy Mine, at 2 to 1. Lasca went
to the front and managed to win in a
hard drive by a neck from Pinkerton,
with Airship third.
Cambaceres, the 3 to 5 favorite for the
hurdle race, did not like the weight
and dropped out of it after a mile. Phil
Archibald won from Poorlandg by half
a length. Heir Apparent being third. '
The Coronado Beach selling stakes,
with $1250 added money, was a good
race. Haviland was favorite from the
first and a world of money went in on
him. He won easily from Orsina, with
The Goldfinder a close third. Elwood
was the strongly played second choice,
but could not keep up. The time was
the best for the distance on this track,
1:46% for the mile and a sixteenth!
Fortunatus, another favorite, won the
fifthÂ« race from Dupont. with C. B.
Campbell third. The books were hard
hit on this race.
Tax Man was favorite for the last
event, but quit too soon and Buccleuth
won. Sallle Goodwin was second and

An unusually large half-holiday
crowd, estimated at more than 6000,
viewed the running of.the Lissak hand
icap, over a mile, yesterday at Oakland.
â¢ The luck of Walter Jennings, shows
no sign of faltering, for his mare
Dainty, ridden by the apprentice lad
Oliphant, finished first, with Claude
pecond and Fossil third. Shotgun, the
stable companion of Dainty, carrying
the top impost, 124 pound*, and the
mainstay of the stable, finished third
from lasu
- Perfect racing weather prevailed, the
track was fact and eleven starters tried
for the rich prize, with a gross valua
tion nf J3&90. of which sum the first
lyorce took $3330. The Jennings duo were
hold at 8 to 5. with lengthy odds against
any of the others. It was figured by
the shrewd ones that even if Shotgun
fell short Dainty was in so well that
she would acro::ipli?h the trick. Such
proved to h& the casp.
SHOTGUN OFF BADLY.
At th<* start Shotgun and Martinmas
Â¦were out off by Stuyve. which swerved
toward the inside, and the big horse
never had an opportunity to show what
he could do. Jockey Club made the run
ning for spven furlongs and was then
passed by Claude, the runner-up. Just
>vhen it looked as if Mike Daly's cam
1 .'dfrner might land. Oliphant came with
st rush on Dainty, winning cleverly by
more than a length in 1:39^4- Fossil,
which ran third throughout, took the
Fhow.
After thrÂ«Â»e choices had been counted
out the next three came through with
out accident, and the books were hard
hit over their victories. Bearcatcher by
his impressive win of the last event is
again a public idol.
In the opening sprint, decided over
the Futurity course, the "Seattle Inter
ijthan" Clctma was away behind time.
For pome reason nobody seemed
to want a ticket on the mare, whereas
Jn prÂ«"-vio;:r; rac^s she was all the rage.
Her showing solved the problem, and
no questions asked. She could not
outfoot anything in the race. Pick-
FOOTBALL GAME
AT BERKELEY
For the First Time the Inter
collegiate Contest Will Be
Decided-' Outside This City
The intercollegiate athletic ; com
mittee of University of California and
Stanford University for this year met
last evening at the Palace Hotel and
formally organized. The committee is
composed of three representatives
from the California University, Ezra
Decota, E. J. Brown and Carl Parker,
and three from Stanford, C. M.NFick
ert. D. E. Brown and J. T. Nourse.
Fickert was chosen chairman and
Parker secretary of the committee.
It was decided to hold the inter
collegiate varsity football game this
year at Berkeley and the freshman
game at Stanford. The second Satur
day in November was selected as the
date of the varsity game and the
third Saturday in October for the
freshman game. Thereafter the
games will alternate each year be
tween the two universities. J
Consideration was eriven to the mat
ter of intercollegiate basket ball
games and it was finally decided to
abolish them. It was agreed that
the first of the baseball games shall
be played at Stanford in 1905, the ex
act date to be named later.
Another "matter taken up by the
committee referred to the award of
medals to first place trackmen, a cus
tom which it was decided to abolish,
the opinion of the members of the
committee being unanimous that, ath
letes should be content with the glory
their victorie's gain for the college.
The representatives from Berkeley re
ported that the work of preparing the
grounds for the varsity football .game
would begin early; to insure their
readiness before the date of the con
test â¢- - ;â¢??;> Â¦ - â¢Â¦
away, a 15 to 1 shot, speedily took the
lead end at the wire was beaten but
a head by Saintly, the mount of Foley;
Matt Hogan was third. Cousin Car
rie also started, with Kunz up.
SOX OF EDDIE JOKES WINS.
An ordinary bunch of two-year-olds
started , in the baby race. On form
Edith Vice looked a shade the best
possibly and was installed a mild fa
vorite. The little filly made a re
markably game showing, only to be
outstayed and beaten a neck by
Gloomy Gus. The winner is the first
of the get of Kodie JCizeB, the latter a
son of Morello, to score brackets, and
was well ridden by Bell. Corn Blos
som ran third.
Â¦ There was as good as 6 to 1 about
Mocorito in the opening betting in the
six and a hp.ll" furlong selling affair,
and the old mare righted any wrongs
ehe may have wrought in her pre
vious excursion. She received splendid
handling at the hands of Jack
Martin, and, catching Sterling Towers
in the Ball home, reached her moor
ings firFt by two lengths. Bay Wonder
was third. Hainault, the favorite, was
even beaten out by the poorly ridden
Jane HÂ«Uy.
Although J. C. Xealon's Rey Dare
looked an absolute certainty for the
mile and a furlong Felling number, the
books laid 4 to 5 against the brown
gelding. He was ridden by Hildebrand
and leisurely galloped in ahead of
Chickadee, the third choicee. The 1 Fret
ter secured show honors from Ethel
Abbott, the second choice.
BEARCATCHER IX FORM.
Garnet Ferguson's slashing colt Bear
catcher led his company the concluding
six f unions run a merry chase. Be
cause of a widely circulated tip on Cas
cine and the vast improvement
that Formaster was going to show, the
ring chalked up 8 to 5 against the Fer
guson entry. There was nothing to the
race from the start but Bearcatcher.
Getting away well the brown fellow
set a scorching clip, leading Formaster
past the judges â¢ by two lengths,, with
plenty in reserve, in 1:13. Judge ran
third and Cascine last.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Bullman has been restored to good
standing by the Judges oi. promise of
better behavior. He can accept
mounts to-morrow. >â¢
Henry Spencer was to have had the
mount on Shot Gun, JSut Jack Martin
wanted it, so Spencer was out in the
cold. Jack didn't see where Dainty
had a chance with the big Artillery
horse and so cheated himself out of
a winning stake mount Oliphant,
who piloted Dainty, is in the employ
of Sidney Bender, and for the oppor
tunities he has had gives promise of
becoming a rider of note.
Bearcatcher is now the real tip

WRECKS THE NERVES AND
UNDERMINES THE HEALTH
Rheumatism is not only the most painful, but oftentimes the most formidable and dan-
gerous of all diseases. The constitution gives way, nerves are wrecked, health undermined
and life made a misery and torture by the terrible pains and aches. Rheumatism is bad
enough, even in its lightest form; but when it becomes chronic and the muscles and sinews
grow hard and stiff and. the joints immovable and fixed, it shows what the disease can do,
and the far-reaching effects of this most terrible of all human maladies. Rheumatism is
caused by uric, lactic and other acid particles in the blood, and every muscle, joint and
fibre that these- acid poisons touch become inflamed and sore, tender and painful. These
acids cause fermentation in the blood, rendering it sour and unfit for the proper nourishment
of the body. The nervous system breaks down for lack of rich, pure blood; the skin becomes
red, swollen, feverish and puffy; the disease is aggravated and the pain intensified by every
movement of muscle or joint; and there is no rest *Â£ rtV1 , M , ._

worse and are exciting causes, but the real source of the disease is in the blood.. Arteries
and veins are fired with the poisonous acids, and exposure is the match that sets the whole
'circulation aflame, and brings out all the distressing symptoms of Rheumatism.
Home remedies, such as liniments, blisters and plasters* have a place in the treatment
of Rheumatism in certain stages. When properly applied they relieve temporarily the
pain and redness, the inflammation and swelling ; but you can never reach the real seat of
the disease from without; the cure must come from within, and it requires a remedy that
can bring the blood back to its original purity, that can relieve the circulation of all
irritating acids and stimulate the sluggish organs and all parts of the system before a
permanent cure of Rheumatism is effected. S. S. S. acts as a purifier of the blood, toning np
the nervous system; it neutralizes and filters out of the blood the, acids and poisons and
restores it; to a pure and healthy state, and arouses all the bodily organs to better action,
and the waste and refuse that has been collecting in the system is promptly carried off

As Pacific Coast Interests grow greater and
become more diversified united action by Pa
cific Coast representatives Is Indispensable.
The coast has a common cause. Its representa
tives should make a common cause in the
halls of natlonat legislation. In years paat
needless Internecine strife has cost the Pacific
Coast States millions. Appropriations by the
national Government that should have been
irfade have-been lost. through wrangles of Pa
cific Coast communities and the reflected in
fluence of these wrangles at Washington. The
representatives of other States have fanned
and utilized Pacific Coast prejudices. These
clever gentlemen have outwardly mourned and
inwardly rejoiced at the miscarriage of Pacific
Coast appropriations. Happily conditions have
changed. The Representatives In Senate and
House of the several' Pacific Coast States and
Territories are working harmoniously for Pa
cific Coast Interests. They have learned,
through varied experience, that desired whole
sale legislation may only be secured through
united effort. There Is a . disposition to pool

They are no longer pulled to and fro by lnc.nl

all for one and one for all. The other State*
hava in times past reaped rich harvests from
crops of discord raised on the shores of UM
Pacific. Â¦ The new era, the era of peace among
Pacific Coast Representatives at Washington,
should bring the Pacific Coast States Into their
own. The change comes none too soon. Th*
Pacific and trans-Pacific developments havÂ»
multiplied the legislative needs of the Pacific
Coast. In the light of the progress and pros
pects of Pacific Coast States, the coloring of
legislation through local prejudices were trea
son to the people who have made the Far
West. The coast Is developing with such
rapidity and on Â«o many lines that favoring
legislation at Washington Is of national con
cern. For the Pacific Coast offers a great and
growing home market for American products
and is the great Asiatic trade base. ThÂ«
menfbera of the California delegation to thÂ»

there is. much more reason for a permanent

the cities where such warehouses are main

The Committee on Commerce, through Sen
ator Perkins, has favorably reported on the
bill providing for tho erection of buildlncs for
an immlsrant station at San Francisco. The
bill appropriates $200,000 for the .erection of
the station. It is Indorsed by Secretary Cor

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 23. â The Eu-
I gene Bowling Club of San Francisco

geles in the first series of five games of
a return match in the easiest kind of
style on Morley's alleys to-night. At
the end of the fifth game the San
Franciscans had a lead on the night's
series of 421 pins and a lead on the
fifteen games rolled thus far of 308
pins. This will probably be sufficient
to win the match, as it Is not thought
the local bowlers can materially re
duce this lead in the five games to be
played to-morrow night.
The work of the Los Angeles men
was a surprise as well as a disappoint
ment to their partisans. Not one of
the five men rolled in good form. Dy
singer and Gilman, the two most de
pendable bowlers on the team, were
unable to locate the head pin. Per
sistent ill-luck followed the locals all
through the play. The Los Angeles
men were able to make a gain In but
one game â the third: â whiclrthey won
by twenty-three pins. Leap, for San

VENTURA, Jan. 23.â The charred re
mains of William M. Stuart were dis
covered upon the bleak mountain side
above Bardsvale last night.
Ten days ago a fierce fire swept the
mountains In that section and Stuart
in endeavoring to save his little prop
erty evidently had been overcome and
then burned to death. He was unmar
ried.and lived alone in a remote can
yon of the mountains. His absence
was not noticed until Thursday, when
he failed to keep an appointment with
his brother, Joseph Stuart of Penrose.
The latter became alarmed and head
ing a searching party started out early
yesterday.
Coroner Beckley, who was summoned
tf> the score, empaneled a jury, which
rendered a verdict of accidental death.
The deceased was a native of Maine,
71 years of age. He was a brother of
Dr. S. I.. Stuart of this county.
The feature to-day will be a match
between Herbert Schmidt'of the Cali
fornia Club and Clarence Griffin of the
Golden Gate Club. It will be played on
the California courts at 2:30 o'cl6ck.
At .the park the handicap doubles
commenced several weeks ago will be
completed. * .

Miss Valleau and Schmidt won a one
sided match from Miss MacGavin and
Harry McAfee. The losers received the
limitâ "30"â but it was not enough.
Schmidt and Miss Valleau will have a
hard time beating Miss M. Ratcliffe and
Stringham with the nominal odds of
"owe 1-6," but they have a chance. The
men are about even, but Miss Ratcliffe
rather outclasses Miss Valleau. i
The other match in the semi-finals
will be between Miss E. Ratcliffe and
Dr. Hardy and Miss Hotchkiss and
Will Allen. The latter will receive odds
of "owe 3-6," and stand more than an
even chance of winning. Miss Hotch
kiss is probably the best lady player In
the tournament. The winner of this
match will in all probability win the
tournament. The remaining, matches
will be played next Saturday afternoon
at 2 o'clock.
Following is the tournament by
rounds:
Miss May RatcUffe and Stringham
were "3-C" back of scratch, and from
that mark beat. Miss Mills and Harry
Rolfe and Miss Page and Cornell easily.
Miss Hotchkiss and Allen got their
place without playing a match. They
drew in the first round and there got a
default from Miss Alice Hoffmann and
Will Collier.
The closest match of the day was that
between Miss Ethel Smith and
Chester Smith and Miss Ellen Page and
Ray Cornell. The former were "2-6"
back of scratch, while the latter were
at scratch. The handicap proved jugt
right, as all three gets were exceedingly
long and close. Smith and Smith won
the first set, and with a lead of 4â1 In
the second looked like sure winners.
Mis-s Page and Cornell played a good
up-hill game and won the set, 7 â 5. The
third set was a repetition of the second.
Smith" and Smith led at 4â2, but were
passed and beaten, 8â6. All four played
good tennis in this match.
The four remaining teams had an easy
time reaching tfye semi-finals. Dr. Sum
ner Hardy was substituted for Drum
mond MacGavin, and was easily the
best player among the men. He and
Miss E. Ratcliffe "owed 13 2-6." They
beat the Beyfuss team and Miss Edna
Davis and Bradley Wallace" without
any trouble.
Eleven teams entered, and of that
number but four were left when dark
ness set in. The successful teams were
Miss Bessie Valleau of Alameda and
Herbert Schmidt. Miss Mary Ratcliffe
of Berkeley and Frank Stringham, Miss
Ethel Ratdiffe of Berkeley and Dr.
Sumner Hardy and Miss Hazel Hotch
kiss of Berkeley and Will Allen. As far
as the ladies are concerned the honors
easily go to Alameda County, as not
one of the local girls qualified.
The handicaps in most cases were too
small, and only one match of the eight

PANAMA, Jan. 23. â Heated debates
on religious questions marked the. sit
tings of the constitutional convention
held last night and to-day. Several
members favored an arrangement sim
ilar to the one existing between the
Colombian Government and the
church, while others desired the abso
lute separation of church and state. Av
to-day's sitting: the discussion of the
matter was progressing with appar
ently no prospects of a conclusion be
ing reached when Dr. Amador pro
posed the following:
"The profession of all religions as
also the exercise of the forms of wor
ship shall be free, without. limitations
than respect for Christian morality and
public order. Nevertheless, it is recog
nized that the Catholic religion is that
of a majority of the Inhabitants of the
republic, and the laws will provide as
sistance toward the foundation of a
seminary in the capital, and missions
for savage tribes."
This was approved.
Article 14, which was also the subject
of discussion, was approved. It is as
follows:
"Ministers of religion are excepted
froan charges for and employment in
the public serf ice, civil or military, re
muneration for which is made by the
public treasury."
It Is Agreed That Government
Will Provide Funds for Cath

Charles H. Spear, president of the
\ Ftate Beard of Harbor Commissioners,
I read an instructive paper descriptive
of what the policy of the board is and
: the work it has en hand. Its purpose,
â¢ he eaid, is to discontinue all Improve
; jntnts that cannot be classified as per
: manent. He denounced the necessity
that makes importers utilize the
wharves for warehouses, and said the
practice must be abolished If the city
wants to keep up with the ever grow
ing demand upon its dockage facili
. ties. He contradicted the report that
San Francisco is regarded by shipping
men as an expensive port, and cited
figures to show that Boston and Seat
tip, whose harbors are largely con
trolled by private corporations, are
more costly to ships that visit them
than is this port, controlled by the
State. When pending extensions are
completed, San Francisco will have the
best wharfage facilities in the world,
p.nd' the Interest on the bonds issued
to effect the" improvements will be
* ! eared from the money saved by the |
abcJltion of wooden driveways and \
bulkheads. ..â \
' Mr. Ncwhall thanked Mr. Spear for \
his instructive address and assured him
that the Chaml>er of Commerce is
heartily in accord with the Harbor
Board's efforts to advance the shipping
interests of San Francisco.
The final of the series was
delivered by H. D. Loveland. president
<>f the Pacific Coast Jobbers' and Man
i:facturers' Association. He told the
history of that organization, saying
ihat. like all other movements, it was
born of want and necessity. The cause
of its being was the desire of the busi
refrs men of San Francisco to protect
their interests in the matter of trans
continental railroad freight charges.

Professor Bernard Moses was asked
to say something: about the Philippines.
Â«nd be said enough about the Orient in
general and Oriental trade possibilities
in particular to arouse his hearers to a
high pitch of enthusiasm. He predicted
the passage of Senator Frye's bill to
â¢extend coastwise shipping privileges to
the Philippines, and' declared that the
enactment of the meSteure Trill be a
mighty factor in promoting the mer
cantile marine business of San Fran
cisco. Among other things it will de
velop the manufacture on this coast of
Manila hempen rope.
Professor Moses then pointed to the
trade possibilities that will result from
[the opening up of China. Fifty years
ago, he said, Japan was as backward
as China now is, devoting all her activ
ity to the production of food to feed
her people. Since* the ports of Japan
have been opened, however, the people
pf that country have transferred their
attention from rice-growing to manu
facturing for export, and now receive
the greater part of their food supply
from abroad. So it will be in China
she has open markets. Then she
will be a greater field for our com
merce than South America could pos
sibly be.
A. A. Watkir.s, president of the City
Board of Trade, made a brief and face
tious address that had nothing what
ever to do with the subject of trade.
and the chairman humorously chided
him for dodging the question.
Professor Carl C. Plehn, dean of the
Oollepe of Commerce of the University
cf California, told of what that institu
. tion is doing in the way of promoting
scientific commerce. The college of
Commerce, he explained, aims to do for
thf business man what the Department
of Agriculture is doing for the fanner.
In commerce there are many subjects
that require scientific treatment â such
as the effect of tariffs upon different
commodities from those upon which*
they are directly levied, and to give en
lightenment on these questions the Col
lege of Commerce is ready to devote
research.

A writer in Scribner's Magazine has

in a Dutch town: "L. Y. D. Zwaan,
Morgen Wekker." which Is Dutch for
"morning waker." But this is an in

London workingmen live, and six
pence a week from each client is the
usual "waker's wage." All over Lon

in wakinjr those whose ' work calls
them early. Only a few nights â or

a rope and pulled till an answering
shout was heard. \ The constable ex

was affixed to the baker's bed clothes.

Late last night after Mahoney had
gone home Detective Braig instituted
a search a.nd found the money hidden
away in a basket In the tool shop of
the building. The money was turned
over to the property clerk in the City
Hall for safe keeping. It is. alleged
that Mahoney, by virtue of his posi
tion, is given the powers of speclalpo
liceman. About two weeks ago he ar
rested a. man for disturbing the peace
and the man in retaliation sued Ma
honey for $5000. Mahoney forthwith
drew his money from the bank, hid it
in the tool shop and then forgot where
he had put it.

taken it.

CHARMING DAUGHTER OF MR. AND MRS. M. H. DE YOUNG, "WHO
MADE HEIR DEBUT IN SOCIETY AT A RECEPTION GIVEN BY
HER PARENTS YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING.
J.C. Wilson was host at a farewell
.dinner- at: the Bohemian / Club .last
night. â¢ Mr. Wilson, who is to wed
Miss Mabel Cluff on February 10, in
vited a few. of his closest friends to
spend one more evening with him be
fore he joins the ranks of the bene
dicts. An excellent menu had been
arranged and speeches combining wit,
philosophy and the usual good advice
were delivered. The occasion was a
most Joyous one, 'but the gathering
broke up early in the evening, as many
of those present had previous engage
ments for other social functions.
Farewell Bachelor Dinner.'
The dining hall was gladdened by
great bunches of oranges clinging to
To this room the older,- folk, retired
during the hours, of the reception, al
lured by the glow of the firelight and
its divans of reposeful depth. *
The library, reposeful in soft green
plush and roseate mahogany, was
alicht with the fireside glow of big
pine lops and soft red lamps.
Here on the bookshelves between the
Satsuma and the Cloisonne â fitting
phrine for flowers â stood great vases of
Bermuda lilies, a sweet token of ihe
memories left behind of the world's
great men and women. ,.
Gowns? Ah! These, too, were works
of art. Virot, Ducet and other masters
of . feminine finesse were represented
in the throng. And no, too, were our
own modistes, distinctive, chic and
Ftunninff.
Here, indeed, the moments snatched
from chit-chat were blessedly spent
with Bougruereau, Carot. Bonheur, Ru
bensâyep, and with lesser people whom
we revere Ie?s, but love as much â some
of our OT.n provincial people who have
written their poems with a brilliant
brush. Before the "Russian Bride" a
stream of women stood in reverie, only
to be disturbed by the tap of a friendly
greetingâ for every one's friend -was
there. Â¦ â¢
At 4 groups of guests began to arrive
to offer their varid congratulations to
the debutante, and at 5 the crush be
gan; at 6 the reception hall, drawing
room, library, dining-room and ball
room were fairly crowded with the
beautyâ the stunning beauty of San
Franciscoâ its wealth and its culture.
The entrance hall, with its overhang
ing branches of budding eucalyptus,
*ar!y in the afternoon became the pop
ular promenade, and the drawing-room
the gilded Mecca. Then, the ballroom
drew the wanderers who had already
paid their compliments to the host and
hostess.
Brilliant was the debut of Miss Con
stance dc Youngâ brilliant far beyond
the "coming out" parties of all the
dainty buds in the years agore.
Yesterday, at the family home â the
home of art and music and of .all that
makes the intellectual life of the old
â¢world and the new â the second daugh
ter cf the household was formally pre
sented to the smart set of the Ameri
ican Paris.
Stationed in the drawing-room to the
left of the hall the debutante, in a
dainty frock of white Valenciennes, re
ceived the multitude of gnests, which
included every San Franciscan in the
social pet â with her mother on her
right and her father on her left. Ex
quisite, indeed, was the setting. The
pink and gold drawing-room was
aglow with rose-hued lights, gleaming
from among thousands of pink-petaled
rosesâ yes, and red, deep, blood-red
j-oses. And their perfume, ah! it must
linger long in the memory of the fair
debutante â for they were the loving of
ferings of her loving friends.

SANTA ROSA, Jan. 23.â Mrs. E. H.
Irish, Miss Willie Moore and Miss Min
nie Bloyd, women of Christine, Mendo
cino County, have suddenly become
heroines in the region by the killing
of a large bear.
Bears have been making inroads on
the flocks near Christine for some time,
and a large log trap was baited and set
for the beasts. While out walking yes
terday afternoon, Mrs. Irish carried a
rifle. She and her companions strolled
in the vicinity of the trap and found
bruin a' captive. The animal had eaten
through the end of the trap and had
succeeded in getting his ; head and
shoulders out. Being afraid the bear
would gain his liberty before masculine
aid could be summoned the women de
termined to slay the beast. Mrs. Irish
fired several shots, but owing to tYie
small caliber of the rifle failed to kill
the bear.
The beast desperately charged* the
side of the trap,' but the women did not
become frightened and faint. They se
cured a large >pole and inserted it be
tween the log* to keep the bear in the
strong end of ihe trap. Mrs. Irish then
fired four bullets at the beast, none of
which found a vital spot, but all served
to enrage it. While two of the women
engaged the bear's attention, Mrs. Irish
awaited a favorable opportunity and
Â«ent a, bullet Into the animal's heart.
The bear weighed 300 pounds' dressed.
The, skin is being tanned to make a rug
for the home of Mrs. Irish.

wall that leads down *to the sea at

copy are the city gates â plcturesqfte
passage ways â which are promptly
and irrevocably closed with the set
ting of the sun. The west gate will
be entered by the tourist on reaching
the capital from Chemulpo and should
he come to the outside of this but a
minute after the sun has disappeared
behind the horizon and the "big bell"
has boomed its mournful warning
note, he is elected to camp in the open

BERKELEY, Jan. 23. â After squab
bling for the greater part of the week,
exhausting three venires aggregating
100 men and raking up one or two
scandals, the lawyers in the case of
"Sam" Fisher, saloonman, charged
with disturbing the peace of E. E.
Newton, agreed to-day upon the Jury
of twelve who t will pass upon Fisher's
culpability. The last two men were
secured this morning, the personnel of
the Jury being now as follows: C. F.
Hurlitz, G. A. Wanger, R. B. Baird,
A. Brokaw. F. E. Kling, Martin Arbu
lich, L. W. Burnhara, J. G. Wright. R.

Jury to Try Fisher Secured.
had done anything so wonderfully
brave. Her mother, however, "says all
the praise is due the child, and is very
proud of her daughter.
An examination of the bedroom where
the girl had encountered the man
showed that he had got into it through
the only window, which he had forced
open with a jimmy. The bed, that stood
near the window, had been pushed
away from the wall and the bureau
drawers had all been ransacked.
The girl told the whole story of the
burglar's visit, to-day, in a modest
way. but did not seem to think that she
strength gave way. Wenzinger arrived
in a few minutes, and when he opened
the door there was no burglar to be
seen, the intruder evidently having
made his escape when he heard of
Wenzinger's approach. .
"Mamma," she said, "you take the
children and get out of the house. I can
hold the door until Mr. Wenzinger
comes. The burglar won't hurt. me if
he does break in."
Mrs. Kulkmeyer. did riot obey, how
ever, and clung to the door until her
of the two children. ? :
At last Freda decided to call her
mother, who lay 111 abed In an adjoin
ing room. She had feared to disturb
her at all, but now there was nothing
else to do. The mother came and took
the place of the brother at the door.
Then the sister dispatched the brother
to summon a neighbor to the scene.
The boy crept out of the back door and
leaped over a fence, going as fast as he
could to the home of A. L. Wenzinger,
a next-door neighbor. In the meantime
the feirl gave orders to the mother to
quit the house.
SICK MOTHER ASSISTS.
The burglar threw his weight against
the door in an attempt to force it
open. But the little girl was on the
other side, bearing all of her ninety
eight pounds against it, at the same
time holding the knob as hard as she
could.
Irving, the brother, had caught a
glimpse of the man too, so he made
haste to add his weight to his sister's.
The tug-of-war lasted about three min
utes, though it seemed an age to both
the children. All this time the man
kept pressing against the door, but said
not a word. The situation began to get
critical, for the labor and the fright
were having their effect on the limbs
BftAVELY HOLDS DOOR.
But while most of the honors of war
are due to the heroine the victory could
not have been achieved without the aid
of the army of two that followed the
directions of the leader. This army
consisted of Mrs. Hermann F. Kulk
meyer, the girl's mother, and Irving
Kulkmeyer, her brother, of 8 years.
These two carried out orders Implicitly
at the critical moment and helped win
the day. i â¢Â¦; ':.rl
The heroine. ran smack into the bur
glar about 8 o'clock last night while
she was going into the front bedroom
of the Kulkmeyer home. She saw him
loom up, big and awful, in the dark
just as she reached the threshold. A
moment more and she would have been
In his arms. But she retired quickly
through tko sitting-room to the kitchen
and slammed the door In the face of
the man, who had made a grab at her.
BERKELEY, Jan. 23.â Miss Freda
Kulkmeyer of 1724 Delaware street is
'only 10 years old, but she has all the
native courage of an African lion of
twice that many years. This was dem
onstrated last night when a burly bur
glar attacked the Kulkmeyer resi
dence with intent to rob it of all its
valuables. With rare presence of mind
this little heroine marshaled the forces
of the household like a major general
ordering his troops and compelled the
ruffian to retreat in disorder and dis
grace through a bedroom window.

Simple Simon was represented by Lyman
Tayloi and Bradley Carr. Reml Knight, In
baker's costume, was Patty Cake, and Mary
Lyle Httchie. all In red, was a most adorable
little witch, with broom to sweep the sky.
The hall was beautifully decorated in green
and white and the children , not only enjoyed
the dancing and game of musical chairs, but
the iT.ovlng pictures, which. In fact, they
teemed to like best of all. Prizes were given
In the game of mucical chairs, the lucky ones
being Donald McClure, Margery Merrltt and
Albertlne Dctrick.
Mrs. Dunning was assisted in entertaining
her little daughters' eruests -by Mrs. J. J.

Island and Mrs. J. R. Burnhani.
Elizabeth Adarro, with "cockle" shells and
pretty maids all in a row," was Mistress
Mary and .'o. also, was Bernlce Bromweil.
Irving Ccckroft wore probably the mott
unique costume In the room â a big, square
clock with mice running up and down. No
one needed to bo told he was Dickery Dock.
Boy Blues there were galore and Mother
Hubbaid was also a guest. Little Bo-Peep,
Old K'njr Cole and mahy other well-known
characters ot Mother Goose fame materialized
and enjoyed the dancing and games most
thoroughly.
Margaret Moore and Ruth Valentine were
milk maids, Lyman King was King of Hearts,
Dorothy Taft was Queen of Hearts and Keu
neth Kendall was the knave who stole the
tarts.
Helen Dunning was a very cunning Miss
Muffett, who wasn't at all afraid of the big
black spider embroidered en her blue satin
cklrt. Her overdress was of yellow satin
and the little bodice was of black velvet.
Mother Goose herself surely never dreamed
of a more beautiful sight than the children
mads In their varied and striking costumes.
Every character In the rhymes so dear to
every child was represented and many of tho
costumes were costly as well as quaint. De
borah Dunning, as Mother Goose. was a
charming little hostess. She wore a blue
satin skirt, with pink silk overdress. A tall,
clack, pointed hat and. tiny red shoes and
stockings completed this very dainty costume.
While the favored "grown-ups" of society
were enjoying the hospitality .of the Misses
Oliver their small sisters and brothers were
having the "time of their lives" at the Dun
ning Mother Goose party at Reed Hall. About
150 of Oakland's Juvenile elite had been in
vited to the fancy dress party given by little
Deborah and Helen Dunning this afternoon
and it certainly looked as if they were all
there.
Miss Bertha Young in pink silk, Mrs. Henry
Diockmann in light blue and Miss Claire
Chabot In white Â«;ik crepe were among those
who wore particularly pretty gowns.
Miss Burdge. who was to have been one
of the honored guests, was not present on
account of the recent death of Mrs. F. M.
Smith's mother. None of the young ladles
from Arbor Villa were there, although all were
to have helped receive.
The receiving party included Miss Jane
Barry, Miss I>etty Barry. Miss Winifred
Burdge, Miss Marian Smith, Miss Grace
Sperry, Miss Florence Nightingale. Miss Eve
lyn Ellis. Miss Ethel Moore. Miss Pearl Jones.
Mrs. Walter Starr, Mrs. James P. Sisson, Miss

Miss Florence Brown, Miss Cordelia Bishop,
Miss Marietta Havens, Miss May Cooxan, Miss
Isabelle Kendall. Miss Alice Knowles, Miss
Ruth Knowles, Mrs. Dan Belden, Mrs. Henry
Kosenfleld. Mrs. Willard F. Williamson, Miss
Edith Selby and Mrs. A. L. Stone.
Miss Isabella Kendall was a dainty picture
in blue with white lace. Mrs. Jack Hampton
wore a very stunning corn-colored silk, and
Mrs. Bernard Breeden wore a very becoming
tan silk trimmed with white lace.
S3Veral wore elegant vplvet dresses. Miss
Crlssle Taft, In blue, and Mrs. Harry Sullivan
of San Francisco In brown, were both very
attractive in gowns of that rich and popular
fabric.
Mrs. Waiter Starr wore a strikingly pretty
gown of pink "Jus!" cloth, and Miss Ethel
Moore was also in pinkâ a chiffon and lace
affair.
OAKUAXD, Jan. 23.â The Oliver card party
to-day, in honcr of the four much-feted young
brides-elect. Misses Edna Barry, Jacquelin
Moore, May Youne and May Burdge, was one
of the larpeat affairs of the kind given this
winter, and r>ot since Miss Anita Oliver's
comlngr out reception has the big mansion on
the hl!l been the scene of so brilliant or so
merry a gatherlnc. Flowers ran riot in t"ho
handsomely furnished rooms-, tlio drawing
room where the young hostesses received being
all in white. St. Joseph lilies and white
chrysanthemums were arranged with exquisite
grace and In the dining-room, also white,
fhasgy chrysanthemums formed the sole dec
oration. The library showed a very pretty
arrangement of violets and autumn leaves.
Card tables were arrar.sed for 140 players,
five hundred being the game for the afternoon.
This is a season of elaborate gowns and few

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
"The -circumstances of my father's
death I know. little about. I am wait
ing for a summons that is likely to ar
rive at any moment, when I will leave
immediately for London."
'â¢My father inherited the estate,
which has passed through the hands
of a long line of ancestors," she said.
"It consists principally of real estate,
much of which is in this country, and
personal property, such as stocks,
bonds and other securities.
Through the death of her father,
George Harvey of London, England,
Mrs. H. F. Patterson of Berkeley has
become the heir to an estate that is
estimated to be worth at least $500,
000. The news came to Mrs. Patter
son to-day in a cablegram from the
legal representatives of the estate, who
request her to go to London and prove
her heirship. She has already begun
her preparations for departure and
will leave within a few days. Mrs.
Patterson said to-day that' she did not
doubt that her father's estate was
worth half a million.

The officers of the University of Cali
fornia and the Associated Students are
havinp various kinds of trouble In their
efforts to build a football oval. There
are any number cf objections to each
plan propose.!, especially in the way
of cost and space, and it wouldn't be
surprising if the whole thing was
abandoned.
In the hope of straightening out the
tancrln the executive committee of the
Associated Students had a consulta
tion with John Ga!en Howard, the su
rervi^lr.g architect of the university,
last nfgnt at the Bache'.ordon Club.
The committee decided to go ahead
with one of the thrve plans submitted.
but even this is likely to breed seri
ous objections.
The obje-oMons come from two quar
tern â ore from the military department
of th? 'sniverfily and the other from
residents. Co'.onrl Henry de II. Waite
firds himself very much cramped for
a drill pronnd just now, with the en
crosthmcrts of other departments
prowiv.rr all the t!mp. If the Hillegass
Tr?rt is taken by the footbai! oval ihe
â¢ ad*t .repirr-ent v.ill bÂ» forced to drill
in the street? or wherever there is a
little roorn. The residents whose homes
face on the HincjraFs Trart are likely
to <-bjÂ« > ct bocausf. it is said, the walls
of IhÂ« field will destroy their view.
Under the.oripinal plan, drsigned to
fat 30,000 people, the cost will be
f 60.000, an altogether too large sum
for the students to spend. It cannot be
carried out without conflicting with
the sites mapped out for the buildings
of the greater university, and there is
rot room enough for the earth bleach
ers unless concrete walls are built to
hold them in place. Another scheme,
involving: the necessity of only one or
two walls instead of four, was found
to be almost as expensive as the first.
. According to the third plan, which
was adrpfKi, piles of earth thirty or
forty feet hiph ivi!l be thrown up, the
bases being eighty feet wide, thus pro
viding a slope for the bleachers. The
objections to this are the proximity of
houses and the dirt on the south side,
which would have to be fifteen feet
lower than en the east and west to
keep the dirt out of the streets. The
estimated cost of this work is $20,000.
There is now ?f>000 available to pay for
it, in that it will be necessary to bor
row the money neÂ«=-ded.

To the Council of the City of Oakland: ThÂ»

Club of Oakland feel the prersir.g; necessity
that exists for a crematory to dispose of the
garbage of the city, and believe that a city
must be clean and sanitary before it can be
made bcautifu!. They fully/realize the dif
ficulties in the way of the Council, but they
also feel that it would be a great wrong to
all of the citizens of Oakland to compel them
to accept the contract under consideration.
They fall to see that the city is under any
moral .obligation to a company which has lost
money because of the failure of th- fulfill
ment of a former Illegal contract and which
would have been notoriously unjust and op
pressive to the city oj Oakland. They there
fore protest against the acceptance of the
present contract with (he Paclfle Incinerating
Company because It is still unfair and unjust
to the city's beat interests.

111S Broadway. Jan. 23.
Investigation to establish the actual
cause of the death of Edward J. Sex
ton, whose dead body was found in
the marshes near Point Richmond
Thursday, has not been completed.
Sexton's back was found to be filled
with shot, but it has not been clearly
established whether these wounds
caused his death or whether it was
due to exposure or drowning.
To this end Coroner Curry of Contra
Costa County to-day ordered Dr. "Wil
liam Lucas to make a detailed exam
ination of the remains.
W. J. Davis and James Clancey, two
men who went hunting with Sexton,
are being held under suspicion of
having murdered him.
Clancey is one of the men who
were accused of killing Henry Walsh
about s ; x years ago. He was acquit
ted of that charge.
The local authorities are also
searching for $900 it is known Sexton
had about a week- ago, when his wife
secured a separation from him.
NEW YORK, Jan. 23.â Eight Hvc3
were lost in the wreck to-day off
Quogue, L. I., of the four-masted
schooner Augustus Hunt, bound for
Boston from NoHolk, Va., with coal. Of
the cre-w of ten only two were saved.
Second Mate George Ebert of Cleveland
and a Swede, who was unconscious
when washed upon the beach and
whose name could not be ascertained.
The vessel was in command of First
Mate Conary, v.ho took charge of her
in place of Captain Robert Blair when
she last left Boston. Soon after mid
night during a dense fog the schooner
stranded a few hundred feet from the
beach and about a mile west of the
Quogue life-saving station. A life-sav
ing patrolman heard the cries for help
and summoned the station crew. For
hours the Hfe-savers were able to hear
the cries of the men on the vessel,
which was near at hand, but buried In
the fog. They were absolutely unable
to help the men. Time and again they
launched their boat, only to have it
hurled back to the shore by the heavy
surf.
The llfe-saveae also had recourse to
life lines, but the shots carrying the
lines either fell wide or short of the in
visible mark. ,
Soon after daylight masses of wreck
age began to come ashore, indicating
that the vessel' was rapidly breaking
up. At noon a spar with a man cling
ing to it was seen tossing on the outer
line of breakers. After a line had been
shot across it and made fast by the
man he was pulled ashore and proved
to be Second Mate Ebert. A few min
utes later another sailor was seen on a
mass of wreckage, and a half-dozen
life-savers, forming a human chain,
dashed into the surf and drew him
ashore. He was unconscious and con
tinued in that condition at a late hour
to-night.
The cries of those remaining on the
wreck continued to grow fainter and
fainter during the afternoon, and final
ly ceased altogether. One body drifted
ashore, but it wa3 so disfigured as to
be unrecognizable.
It is believed that only the bow of the
vessel remains on the, bar. and that
from this the exhausted seamen
dropped one by one until all were swept
away. The vessel and cargo were valued
at $35,000.

fleht it out. and I'll see fair play," euj^gestcd
Edner. Holmberg agreed, but once on the dock
Edner and Gwin crabbed hir.i and after a
battle laptins ten minutes, during which Holm
berg smashed one pair of handcuffs, the
prisoner was placed on board the patrol wagon
and hurried to the harbor station. Of the men
that cast eft the lines whrn the Glory of the
SeaÂ« left the wharf, seven had black eyes.
Easier to Â«ay than accomplished, however,
and when Holmberg reinforced his ready fists
with a belaying pin and defied the world.
Policeman Edner rieclded that etrategy might
be more eftectUe than force.
The ship Glory of the Seao. Captain Pindlnp,
which sailed yesterday for Ladyemith, will
make- the trip to the northern port without a
mate. When Olaf Holmberg, v.-ho was mate,,
boarded the ship at Greenwich-street wharf
he ivas drunk and agweÂ»sive. Captain PlnUIns
remonstrated, and when Holmberg threatened
to punch the skipper's head a big eailor stepped
between the captain and mate. Bans went
tho mate's fist agnir.rt the sailor's jaw and
down went the tar. Another mariner stepped
up and followed the first to the deck. Other
sailors Joined in and all found the mate in
good fightins form. The battle became gen
eral. In the confusion C.iptain Pinding went
ashore and telephoned for the police. Officers
Edner and Gwin responded. With some dif
ficulty Captain Pinding pointed out the busiest
and bloodiest of the fighting mob. "That's
the man. Arrest him."

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
The many visitors to London who
flock here at this time of year will be
interested to hear that the Pyx Chapel,
in 'Westminster Abbey, which has
hitherto been jealousry guarded from
the public gaze, is shortly to be lighted
by electricity and thrown open for gen
eral inspection. Here was formerly tho
royal strong room, where the regalia
and the King's money were kept, and
from this treasury in 1303, while Ed
ward I was warring in Scotland, was
stolen the Â£100,000 which was to pay
the expenses of the campaign. The
stone door, with seven locks, had for
merly a covering of human skins, and
one wonders if they were those of the
daring robbers of Plantagenet times.
The pyx, which contained the stand
ard pieces of gold and silver used at
the "trial of the pyx," first ordered in
the reign of Henry II, has been trans
ferred to the mint, and the regalia,
since the restoration, have been kept at
the Tower. The only object of interest
now to be seen in the chapel, if we ex
cept a few ancient chests, is an old
stone altar, and there is no longer any
reason for keeping it under lock and
key. â London Chronicle.

A friend is r man with whom you can

Car building has become a science,
the details of which are worked out
carefully in the Interest of the safety
and comfort of the traveling public.
The solidity and strength of the sleep
ing car are regarded as guarantees of
safety for. -which many people cheer
fully pay the additional fee required
for occupying them. A review of rail
way accidents for the year shows that
a very small percentage of those who
suffered from them were occupants
of sleepers or chair cars, the principal
reason being that these cars were
heavy enough and strong: enough to
resist shocks that wrecked the ordi
nary passenger coaches and reduced
to splinters the mail, express and bag
gage cars.
The modern engine is a machine or
wonderful power and endurance; the
vestibule system makes a compact and
solid train, the resistive powers of
Â¦which reduces very largely the danger
to passengers in case of wreck. Be
tween these two extremes, drawn by
the one and pushed, in case of suddea
stoppage, by the other, are the mail,
express and baggage cars that are
constructed on lines that have fol
lowed the road for years, showing al
most no improvement. It follows
that the workers on these cars are en
gaged in vocations of extraordinary
hazard, and the Government, in be
half of its faithful servitors, the rail
way mail clerks, will be asked and
urged to pass a law requiring mail
cars to be more substantially con
structed. â Exchange.
It is asserted, and the proof of the
truth of the assertion is not wanting,
that measures for the protection of
railway mail clerks from injury by col
lision and other forms fof railway dis
aster have not kept pace with meas
ures with which the great railway sys
tems have in recent years been busy
for the protection of other classes of.
travelers. For example, ensines have
increased In weight and strength of
constructionrand vestibuled cars have
been built that are almost proof against
telescoping, whereas such changes as
have been made in the mail car render
It more likely than ever to be crushed
between the heavy masses before and
behind it in case of collision. In ghast
ly proof of this neglect is the large
percentage of mail clerks who are kill
ed or injured in the service. Congress
at Its coming session will be asked to
look Into the matter and enact a law
compelling railroad companies to ex
tend improvement -1n car building to
the mail cars that are a part-and a
very important partâ of their rolling
stock. . Â¦Â¦"Â¦.â¢.'Â¦Â¦-."'

Wheat and Other Grains. *
WHEATâ Foreign futures were lower. Chi
cago advanced lc. The Chicago dispatches of
Bolton. de Buytc-r & Co. said: "The short
fellers of yesterday were largely the buyers of
to-day. As . Ions as the present strained and
contested situation prevails in respect to the
May option this is likely to, recur and a good
scalping market will probably be the result.
The other conditions are. In the main, dull
foreign markets and continued large primary
receipts. With the exception of local milling
demand, there is a poor npot situation. Ar
centine shipments of Wheat. . except as inter
fered with by thHr strike, are likely to be
at an increasing ratio and to reach liberal pro
portions. Unless something new develops- in
the political situation it may bo taken as
tenJInp toward peace. The local Bpeculatlve
situation makes the tendency rather difficult
to forecast. On the penerar commercial posi
tion we are Inclined to think July Wheat is
higher than It would be except for the manipu
lation in May. September Wheat Is practically
the next crop. It has been up to 80c and is
now still in that neighborhood. It is a pretty
high price. We are inclined to think It won't
hurt much to rell it on the rallies, and It minht
ultimately pay a fine profit. We would let May
Wheat strictly alone. 1 / | . Â¦

Provisions.
Chicago was easy, with continued outside
buying and the packers selling. It is hard td
get Hogs into that market, owing to the bad â¢
condition of the country roads. Growers think i
that they will be higher and are holding them
up to 4?i@5c. which the shippers cannot afford
to pay.
This market continues dull and weak. The
Chicago wires of Bolton. de Ruyter & Co. said:'
"Market is a shade easier. Receipts of. Hogs j
at primary markets were in excess of last year.
Prices at yards were a' shade higher. Indica
tions are that O>e movement for the coming
week will be fully up to the week now end-
Ing. Supply Is running a little in excess of
last year, while the distributive demand is no i
better. Packers are free sellers of products,
and thÂ« outside scattered speculative buyer is
carrying the load. The load is steadily In
creasing."

j Burbanks ruled firm at steady rates. Only

i steady and unchanged. Onions were in good
request and prices were firmer. The steamer

300 sacks.

were lighter than usual and there was a gen- 1

j wa? overstocked with old and poor quality of- j
ferlngrs of Tomatoes, which have been accumu- '
I lating for more than a week, and such stock
I moved slowly at unsteady prices. Fresh ar

, Poultry and Game.
Poultry closed the week dull, with retailers
liberally supplied and a car or Western stock
. that came in yesterday had to be carried over
lor Monday's market. Including the car that
came lr, yesterday there were seven* cars . of.
Western received during the week and fully
60 per cent of the car that came tn on Friday
was still on hand at the close. The dally re
ceipts of dotrjestic stock were light, but tha
1 { market for that line of goods was weak during
â¢ the past three days owing to the heavy ar
i rivals of Western, and quite a few coops hail
to be carried .over. A few cases of dresied
Turkeys came in yesterday, and as there was
1 very little demand prices showed no improve
; ment .
. Game met with a sluggish demand and prices
were barely steady. Offerings were liberal
and Ducks and. Geese were generally poor and
thin owing to the cold dry weather and conse
quent lack of feed In the interior. -

â¢ Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
The depression in Cheese continues and' will
until the present enormous stocks become re
duced. One of the chief causes of the demor
alization of the market has been the discon
tinuance of. the Oriental export demand, which
has been practically suspended since last Sep
tember. The exporters say that prices advanced
I to yuch a .high point during the last half of
J 1903 that the Chinese-Japanese demand, always
' an Important factor In . this market, .and the
Hawaiian demand became diverted to Austra
lia and Chicago, where the goods conld be
bought, cheaper. It appears that Cheese. was
quoted f.o high in San Francisco that Chicago
waa able to supply the Orient right over our
heads. Latterly, overstocked markets and tha
unsettled high rates of exchange due to the
Eastern complications prevented the'. Oriental
Importers from buying In this market. Our
local exporters say that had not this Oriental
demand been shut off our stocks of. cold-storage
Cheese would have been used up long Hgo, and
the current depression In the market would
not have been experienced. They report, how
ever that the Oriental orders are commencing
again, and they hope to regain the lost trade
in the near future. The market continues- dull
and weak with the tendency still downward.
Butter closed the WÂ£ek firm, with light sup
plies of strictly fine creamery, and some
houses quoting an advance over the top quota
tion below. The Humboldt steamer brought
only fourteen boxes. 4
The demand for medium nnd lower grade
Eggs, continues and these descriptions , rule
firm, while the more expensive ranch are quiet.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The warmer weather seemed to encourags
most dealers in Citrus fruits and a little better
feeling" prevailed. Retailers were purchasing
a little more J reely than usual in order to
meet the extra requirements for Sunday, but
the volum* of trade continued small, and as
stocks of all descriptions were : heavy - prices
showed no Improvement. As previously : men
tioned, the large sizes of fancy Navels were
in limited supply, and, such offerings were
firmly held, while there' was the usual pressure
to pell medium and small-sized fruit.'. Ten earn

THE PATENTS AND FIELD OF THE
MARCONI COMPANY.
The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America owns the present
and prospective patents of Marconi, as well as the Wireless patents of
Thomas A. Edison. Professor Michael Idvorsky Pupin of Columbia College
and of Professor J. A. Fleming of the University of London. This fact
practically removes fear of serious competition. The Company operates
under the above named wireless patents in the United States, Cuba, Porto
Rico, the Hawaiian Islands, the Philippine Islands. Alaska and the Aleutian
Islands. â¢
The plants of the Marconi system in the United States are at South
Wellfleet, Cape Cod, Mass; (Transatlantic), Herald Station, Nantucket
Lightship Station, Siasconset, on Nantucket Island, Mass.; Sagaponack.L.L;
Babylon, L. I.; Chicago, III.; Milwaukee, Wis., and there is also one at Glace
Bay, Nova Scotia. The stations in Great Britain are at Withernsea, Caistor,
Fritton, Chelmsford, North Foreland, Dungeness, New Haven, Portsmouth,
Culver Cliff, Niton, Poole, Portland, Lizard, Scillies. Poldhu, Crookhaven,
Queenstown, Rosslare, Holy Head, Inishtrahull. In Germany there are -
stations at Borkum Island and Borkum Lightship, and in Belgium at Lay
Panne. . ' â¢ . ! ;
The English Admiralty has land stations at Malta, Gibraltar, Tientsin,
Hongkong, Bermuda, and has all of its men of war equipped with the ap-
paratus; among them the following: Majestic, Magnificent, Mars, Terrible,
Furious, Arrogant, Argonaut, Europa, Revenge, Ariadne, Minotaur, St.
â¢George, Minerva, Gladiator, Cressy, Glory, London, Good Hope, Hannibal,
Jupiter, Vernon. .The- Italian Royal Navy has five land stations and all its â¢
ships equipped with the apparatus.
Marconi is now engaged in the construction of a high power station at
Pisa, Italy, "which, when completed, will be capable of communicating over
5000 miles with Argentina, as well as with South Wellfleet.
GREAT FORTUNES HADE IN ELECTRI-
CAL INVESTHENTS.
Some of 'the greatest fortunes of this country were made by early in-
vestments in' the Edison Electric Light Company and in the Bell Telephona
Company, while hundreds of small, investors became independently wealthy.
The stock of the Edison Electric Light Company advanced from $100 t9
$4000 in one year, and that was several years before dividends were de-
clared. Bell Telephone stock increased from $i a share to more than $1000
a share, and the profits of an original investor of $roo in the Bell Telephone
Company are more than $200,000. k 'Â» .
The time to buy is now. Don't wait for the price to go, beyond your
reach". The stock of the British Marconi Company has advanced 340 per
cent in two years. *

Charles Sullivan, convicted of murder
in the second degree, and John H.
Powell, convicted of manslaughter for
the killing of Special Officer Robert A-
Sample on Folsom street, between First
and Second, on the morning of August
11, appeared in Judge Lawlor's. court
yesterday for sentence.
At the previous calling of the cases
an affidavit had been filed by Powell al
leging that he, and not Sullivan, fired
the fatal shots at Sample in self-de
fense, and on that showing Sullivan's
attorney made a motion for a new trial.
Yesterday Sullivan's attorney filed an
affidavit, signed by . Joseph Mann,
former bailiff in Judge Lawlor's court,
to the effect that while Powell's trial
was going on he had heard Powell say
in the presence of his attorneys that
he had a good mind to make a clean
breaet of it, and on being pressed to ex
plain Powell said:
"I and Charley were going up Folsom
street peaceably, when all of a- sudden
Robert Sample came up behind me and
struck me on the back Â¦'"of the head
with a club. I turned . and grappled
with him and took his pistol away from
him r and . shot him. I acted in self-
dpfens**."

They found the quarters admirably ar

being placed in position. The company
has a large and commodious drill room.

CHANGES % OP COMMANDS.
"According to the charter, each of
. the men removed by the Health Board
was entitled to a fair trial. The claim
is advanced that the changes were
, made for economy, retrenchment and
the, betterment of the service. I would
like to know which appointment was
made for economy, which for re
. trenchment and which for the better
ment of the service. As a matter of
fact, the changing of the names of
certain positions without any Import
,a.nt change of duties was merely a
Eham and a pretense."
Ruef then took the* floor on behalf
of the Board of Health. He spoke

fterests of a better and more economi
.cal conduct of the city's business.

[from the wilderness that civil service

â¢ against the administration are false.
; There has been no sham and no sub

I tion in abolishing certain positions and

At the opening of the session yes

' copy of the rules governing the Cook
1 County Hospital in Chicago, which he
'wished admitted in evidence. The
' new Health Board, he said, has adopt
"ed these rules ar.d his object in pre

â¢ can see that tiie duties of David Wolf, the
â¢, deposed secretary, and those cf McQualde, the
1 Â«xeJ slant warden, are identical, with the ex
cep:ion that the board has given the latter

â¢ which authority it baa no povivr to delegate t.>
Â¦ cny one. L*>u.lÂ£ lÂ«evy'Â« title, likewise, is only
a sublerfue*. as his duties are simply thosa
of secretary.
Â¦ Judge Slack followed, stating that
the changes were not made in the in
terests of retrenchment and economy,
as claimed, but merely for political
perposes and as a. sham and a pre
tense. In support of this he called
attention to the testimony of Dr.
Green, who had sworn that when in
formed of his removal from office Dr.
,"Ward had stated frankly that Green's
Â¦ services were always satisfactory, but
the change was a result of "a turn in
the political wheel."'
Judge Flack then quoted a decision
of the New York Supreme Court in a
Fimilar case, where reinstatement was
ordered. Continuing:, he said:
