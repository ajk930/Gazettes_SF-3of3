DENVER, July 28.â Hypnotism Is to be
adopted by Judre LJndeey as a distinct
feature in the work of the Juvenile court,
in which work he has won prominence.
This fact was announced to-day by the
Judg-e on his return from. Portland, Ore.,
where he has been attending the Interna
tional Convention of Charities and Cor
rections. The manifold possibilities which
lie ia this new method, which Is undoubt
edly the most sensational ever introduced
in any court in any place, were discussed
at length by Judge Lindsey. He is under
the impression that he will be able. to do
more good, which will be lasting good,
by this mode of treatment than he has
ever done heretofore.
"My intention is," said he, "to practice
myself, so that I may become proficient.
.1 shall also have my other workers study
the subjet. I shall endeavor "when I am
away to secure the services of prominent
hypnotists to take my place in dealing
with the children. When I take it up, as
I have determined to do, I shall go into
it for all that it is worth." .- . .
While the children are in a* lypnotlc
state the cessation of objectionable be'

will be released.
FIXE RAGES IN HOLD
OX LIXER TEUTONIC
Three 3Len Narrowly Escape
Death in the Fumes and -
Smoke.
CpecUl Plspatcb to The CaU.
NEW YORK, July 2S.â While a fire
raged for an hour to-night below the
â¢water line in the hold of the big 1 . White
Star steamship Teutonic the officers and
crew joined the firemen in the rescue of
three men who were trapped in the>
darkness. They had to be carried to
the deck. ;
Braving a dense smoke and \u25a0 the
fumes, two of the firemen went to the
very bottom of the chip and, picking
up the trapped men, carried them up,
the ladders a distance of about sixty
feet to safety. . .
The fire was In thÂ« electrician's room
on the port side of the ship on an " orlop
deck just above the engine-room and
adjoining the storeroom.- where . are
paints, . oils and other materials which
If once ignited probably would have
caused the destruction of the ship.
To prevent this and save his own life
John Burns, chief storekeeper, locked
himself in his room by means of an iron
door, which at one time was red from the
heat and which had to be cooled by the
firemen before Burns could be taken out.
He then had collapsed.
According to Acting Battalion Chief
McGuire, who directed the efforts of the
tnen, the fire started with an explosion,
caused by the burning out of a plug -in
the switchboard In the electrician's room.
The vessel was lying at her pier off
West Eleventh street, having arrived
from Liverpool on Thursday. All of the
crew were accounted for. It is said the
vessel will be repaired in time to sail for
Liverpool.

Case Now WiU Be Taken on
Appeal to Illinois Su
_,:: preme Court
. . CHICAGO. Jnly 2S. â Johann Hoch,
"Bluebeard" and confessed bigamist,
sentenced, to be banged to-day for
poisoning one of his wives, - was this
afternoon granted a reprieve until Au
gust 25 by Governor Deneen. The stay
of execution followed hours of anxiety
on the part of Hoch. who had never
given up hope, and - was allowed by
the Governor only afte^r the latter had
been assured that the necessary -funds
to appeal the: case had been raised.
The amount. $500. was given by an at
torney and , friend of , Hoch's counsel.
The attorney declared that he was ac
tuated purely, by humanitarian motives.
;*An , incident ; at the Jail during the
preparations for the execution .was tha
appearance . â¢of a physician and a
woman, who told Jailer {Whitman that
they 1 wanted to hel^ In Hoch's battle
for life.* They said they wished to raise
funds for the condemned man and asked
Jailer /Whi tman to , delay the han %lng
as lons as i possible. * Haoh's attorney,
however, bad already been in com
munication -with -theâ authorities re
garding a stay of sentence. '
. All arrangements, had been, made for
the. execution to-day, \ and, , : in < view,, of
the faction; of Governor. Deneen yester
day. In refusing a stay o* execution and
similar action .' by the Board *of Par
dons.* Hoch's chance for life was con
sidered slight.
;: REPRIEVE IS GRAMED.
About, the time -set for the execution,
the woman and attorney appeared for
the first time. The attorney. . it was
said,- telephoned. Hoch's lawyer that the
former had $500 to give toward aiding
to appeal the case. \u25a0 The two lawyers
hastened to the jail, told Jailer Whit
man iof the money secured and - ar
ranged with the Jailer to postpone as
long as possible the execution of Hoch.
Meanwhile they sought State's Attar
ney^Healey and had. him arrange a con
ference with Governor Deneen over, the
long-distance telephone. Hoch's coun
sel told the Governor that there was
lacking only a small sum of the amount
necessary for a review of the case.
After discussing the matter" with
Healey. the Governor finally consented
to a stay for the condemned man and
so notified Hoch's counsel."
' Hocb. even several hours before the
time set : for the hanging, was qnlta
confident ! of executive clemency." â¢ al
though at times he seemed to despair
of ' receiving |a- reprieve.
i He had retired early in the night and
awoke at 7 o'clock this .morning:, cor
dially greeted" hfs death watch of two
guards and. talked with them for some
time. He changed *hlsv clothes., and
seemed resigned to the fate that await
ed hlnCbut he assured his few visitors
that" there might be a chance for 'him
yet >'â¢ ' " - '
lIOCH FV CHEERFUL MOOD.
He received hi 3 attorney, two min
isters, Jailer Whitman and Dr. W. F.
McXamara. the jail -physician. Hoch
discussed with .them bis prospects for
a stay and reiterated his innocence of
the charge . of murder- ; He' read the
Bible and said bis prayers. > - Â«stKjj|
Meanwhile, unknown, to, Hoch. tha
negotiations for the . reprle've were pro
gressing. It was noon and" the - delay
up to thls s tlme Inspired Hoch wlthirer
newed hope. He ate dinner, smoked a
cigar .and read.
; Half an' hour later, through the win
dow, of his Quarters he recetved J the
news of his reprieve. " It was conveyed
to him by spectators of the" proceeding* \u25a0
in the State's Attorney's oflice. He was
disinclined- to. believe the news at first,
but when It., was brought. also. by. the
ministers he .was overcome. He
clasped their hands and declared that
he! was the happiest man alive. The
crowd s about " the Jail sent up 5 a shout
that .was heard . for blocks. The . pris

Hoch waa almost overcome. Hocbr said:

Refers to Russia and Not
to the 3likado's Country
NEW YORK, July 2*.â No statement
was' given out at the headquarters of the
Japanese peace commission to-day rela
tive to the visit to President Roosevelt
of Barcn Komura and Minister Takahira.
the Japanese commissioners. Mr. Sato,
Minister Resident to the Emperor of Ja
pan, who is the official spokesman for
the commission, said, however, that
President Roosevelt made no request for
an armistice.
Inquiry was made of Mr. Sato as to
the attiutde of the Japanese on the ques
tion of an armistice, and he replied:
"Japan is perfectly willing to agree to
an armistice after the credentials of both
commissions have been examined and
verified. The examination of credentials
must, necessarily be the lirsi duty of the
peace delegates to ascertain that all are
qualified to act as represented. In tlic
negotiations for peace that ended the
Clii!iese war. I remember there was much
delay because the credentials of one of
the Chinese envoys did not bear the
Emperor's seal granting him plenary
powers. _ _.--
"However, I think an armistice will be
agreed upon after the commissions enter
formally upon their work. It has been
the custom in all peace negotiations to
cease hostilities during the convention of
â¢ peace plenipotentiaries."
Mr. Sato was asked as to the definite
powers of the members of his commis-
Eion and he said:
"They have power to reject any pro
posal and commit the Japanese Govern
ment to any document they may sign,
subject, of course, to the sanction of the
, The report that China intended asking j
en indemnity Mr. Sarto had read, and
regarding this he said:
"China would not a^k any indemnity
of Japan! !t was her inability or unwill
ingness to keep Russia out of Man- I
churia that forced us into the war." \u25a0
\u25a0 Throughout the day Baron Komura has j
applied himself closely to his official J
duties. Many dispatches are transmit- j
ted to and from Tokio. and all the Fecre- J
taries with the suite are taxed with an
enormous amount of work.
To-night Baron Komura and his suite
dined with the trustees of the Japanese
Club.
Mr. Sato commented upon the recep
tion to Secretary Taft in Tokio and said
he had read the reports with deep inter
est. The fact that the historic chrysan
themum gardens had been thrown open
to the Secretary. Mr. Sato said, was in
dicative of the feeling toward Americans
iv Japan.
"These gardens are almost sacred in
our country." said Mr. Sato, "and this is i
the first time they have been opened to a |
foreign citizen. It is a marked distinc- j
t:on and honor. They are opened for our
own people but twice a year."

'japanrw Financial Agent Thinks Peace
In Xear at Hand.
LpNDON. July 29. â The Statist this
morning publishes an interview with
Koretjyo Takashi. the special finance
commissioner of Japan, who expressed
himself as hopeful that peace will re
sult from the coming negotiations. He
bases this hope on his personal convic
tion that Japan's terms will be rea
sonable and that t.ie true interests of
Russia require that she make peace.
Thf appointment of M. de Witte, he
adds, Ktrentrthens this hope.
Should hostilities continue. Mr. Taka
t-hi says, Japan is in a. position to prose
cute the war successfully, as she'has on
hand as a result of the two recent loans
the means to carry on the conflict for
n considerable time and if the war
should continue there Is no question
that she will be able to borrow fur
ther.
Asked whether Japan would have to
borrow should peace be declared. M.
Takashi answered in the affirmative,
pointing out that large sums would be
necessary for the development of For
mosa, Korea and Hokkaido.

KILLING BILLS
HIS SPECIALTY
James Caldwell of House of
Commons Sits Like Watch
dog During the Session
PKOPOSES -NO MEASURES
Wields Vast Power Simply
by Putting Quietus Upon
Objectionable Legislation
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, July 28.â Though he makes
little stir in the political world, James
Caldwell is one of the.. mos.t remarkable
and potent figures in the inner life of the
House of Commons. He Is a poor speaker
and counts for little as a politician, and
yet he has more influence and control of
the work of the House than any other
private member.
A wealthy bachelor and retired from
business, the world seems to offer him
but one form of real delight. To Parlia
ment he gives his undivided time and
attention. During the many years that
he has held a seat there he has never
missed an hour that the House has been
in session. He lunches there, takes his
tea there, dines there and if it afforded
private bedrooms he would certainly
sleep there. Unable to do that, he lives
just as close to it as he can.
He seems to think that of all the evils
that afflict the world legislation is one
of the greatest and that it is his chief
mission in life to stop as much of it as
possible. Long practice has made him
an expert at this sort of game. If the
members were privileged to wear scalps
for the bills they have killed. Caldwell
would have to carry a dozen belts around
his ample waist to support all his tro
phies.
USE OF THE MIDNIGHT RULE.
Smiling and benign, with long white
whiskers, a rubicund . face and a soft
voice, "Jimmy" Caldwell, as he is calleu
by his friends, could play Santa > Claus
with hardly any make-up. And yet his
opposition to a bill inspires greater ter
ror among its supporters than that of any
of the Titans of debate. Single handed
last session he slew the musical copy
right till, and in consequence the pirates
now hold the field so completely that
some of the biggest musical publishers in
London have temporarily retired from
business.
It is the rules of the House, and his
thorough mastery of them, which en
able Caldwell to exercise such great
power. Chief among them is what is
known as the 12 o'clock rule. It pro
vides that no bill shall proceed after
midnight if any member objects. Except
for a few days in the earlier months ol
each session nearly all the i time of the
House up to midnight is taken up with
Government business. At that hour there
are usually a dozen, sometimes a score,
of bills, most of them proposed by pri
vate members, awaiting action. The
clerk at the table solemnly reads out the
names of each of them in succession.
All a member has to do to knock any
one of them out for the time being is
to take off his hat and pronounce the
magic words, "I object."
That is Caldwell's opportunity. While
the sponsors for these measures curse
him under- their breath, with the blandest
of smiles and the sweetest of voices he
ruthlessly consigns them to oblivion.
CONSULTED BY MEMBERS.
But his midnight labor represents only
a small part of his devoted efforts ,to
block legislation. Ministers are always
on the lookout for chances to sneak
through bills when the vigilance of the
average member is relaxed. The half
hour before the dinner hour offers ,the
best opportunities for this sort of game.
But it can never be done without Cald
well's consent.- If that has not been ob
tained he is sure to oppose the measure
whatever it is, and will talk against it
in a fashion that leaves nobody a bit
the wiser until the dinner hour is reached
and the House automatically adjourrfs.
At each session, especially toward the
close when business and time grow
precious, the strange spectacle may be
witnessed of the most powerful members
of the Government calling this benevo
lent-looking Scotsman into consultation
to ascertain if he will- graciously permit
this or that bill to pass. Yet outside the
House the dictator's name is hardly
known. He has never been known to
propose a bill himself, but he has killed
more of them than any man living.

The 1 statement, follows: 1 â¢
"I went, down to-day to see the hospi
tal for children suffering from, bone
troubles/which is managed in conjunc

the Condition of the Poor. The -hospital
is at the Sea Breeze Home, Coney Island.
About 2SO: children -are taken each week
to the Sea Breeze : under the \u25a0 fresh , air
fund and over 5000 : during the season.
The hospital has room for only forty-five
children and .there, are more than ,4000
cases of bone \ tuberculosis in . each I tene
ment house: dlstrict v of New; York. Now
the trustees are trying toraise a fund for
a hospital which shall hold' 4oo patients.
The fresh air fund people, are obliged .to
refuse admission to 2000 or more ap
plicants-' annually.; . . â¢' :
"The. sea air treatment of bone-tuber
culosis has been found to be marvelously
successful. Here also it has proved so
successful that at the Sea Breeze Home
they have not lost a single patient. All
were benefited and! most* of them were
cured. .*>â¢ \u25a0\u25a0 ' . -
"I. feel there can be few more bene

this seaside hospital for. tenement chil
dren suffering, from bone" tuberculosis.
"On the way , home the Sylph .went up
the Hudson and when we passed the bat
tleship I: signaled them not to salute,
but I did want to ; see the formidable

immensely pleased at the way in which
Admiral v Evans and the officers under
him have performed their diverse duties
in maneuvering this immense fleet,, and

TROUBLE OVER CUSTODY
V',!. OF INSANE FILIPIXO BOY
Finally Placed. In State ' Asylum in
; Kansas Pending; Effort to In
terpret Law.
: TOPEKA, Kans.; July 25.â Thomas
Bonega, a Filipino boy, .was placed in
the State Asylum for the Insane to
day. He. was brought to this country
by Captain Bundy of the Sixth -United
States -Infantry and kept at Fort
Leavenworth for a time. . The question
has arisen, must a Filipino be natural
ized before he can be placed in an In
sane asylum in the United States? The
Board "of Control has clashed over the
attempt to secure iuformatlon, and,
rather than wait longer for Federal ad
vice, committed the boy.
â¢ â¢The Kansas State law provides that
no alien can gain residence until he has
declared his intention to become nat
uralized. Information, from .the super
intendent of the Government Hospital
for the'lnsane states that Sonega could
not be received into that institution
and he knew of no law for the care of
such cases.

The Klng'a .YTnsioved Hand.
It was noticed in Paris when King
Edward was there that he always ap

gloved, but not his left. As it Is a com

loose, and not the left, much specula
tion has been excited by. the King's, re
versal of this custom. One learned
writer suggests that it is due to a
sound perception of hygienic propriety.
The object-o.f a glove, he says, is not to
adorn, but to protect the hand. Which
hand has the most constant employ
ment and is therefore brought into
closer contact' with microbes? Why,
the right hand. It follows that In keep

CROP REPORTS
ARE FAVORABLE
Confidence in the Situation
Is Beflected by Enlarged
Orders for Fall.. Delivery
MAEKET IS IMPEOVIJs'G
Industrial Conditions Are
in Striking â¢ Contrast to
Those Prevailing Year Ago
NEW YORK. July 23.â Bradstreefs to
morrow will say:
Crop reports and fall trade advices are
more unanimously favorable 'than at any
preceding time this season.
Confidence in the crop situation 13 re
flected by good fall orders and a voluma
of wholesale and retail trade certainly In
excess of a year ago and fully equal to
the average at this season. Trade in
woolen fabrics 13 grood. confirmation of
this being found in freer buying by
manufacturers of raw material at ruling
high prices. ;
A heavy movement of winter wheat has
helped collections. Building is more, act
i ive throughout the. country, confirming
i the most optimistic predictions made
i earlier in the season.
Wheat, including flour exports for the
week ending July 27. are 864.14S bushels
against 705,320 bushels last week and 1.
613,263 bushels this week last year. From
July 1 to date the exports are 3,472.779 "
bushels against 5,136,171 last year.
The business failures in the United
States for the week ending July 27 num
ber ISS aeainst 165 last week and 171 in
the like week of 1904.
In Canada failures for the week num
ber 2S as asalnst 22 last week and 17 ln^
this week a year ago.
Dun's Weekly Review of Trade will
Bay:
Commercial tendencies are still In the
direction of- improvement. Confidence ex
pands as the crops are secured, each day
putting a large quantity of grain beyond
danger and making sensational rumors cf
loss less effective. Weather conditions
have been favorable for retail distribu
tion, reduced stocks in the hands of deal
ers being reflected in enlarged wholesale
and jobbing demands. Evidences of faith
in the future are Increasing, more dispo
sition being shown ta provide for re
quirements beyond Immediate consump- -
tion.
The industrial situation is In striking
contrast to conditions 'prevailing a year
ago when there was much idleness both
on account of quiet trade and labor
controversies. Complete returns now
available for the leading departments in
dicate that the first half of 1005 made a
better comparison with the correspond
ing six months of last year than even the
most sanguine estimates, which naturally
increase optimism regarding business dur
ing the second half. Foreign commerce
at this port for the last week was
almost identical with the results In IDOI.
Traffic interests begin to feel the pressure
of crops, but facilities have proved ample
thus far and railway earnings in July
were larger than in the same time last
year.
Hides have advanced still further, and
conservative buyers are beginning to hesi
tate before placing orders almough the
scarcity is admitted.
Failures this week number Zl\ in the
United States against 220 last year and
27 In Canada compared with IS a year
ago. "

WERE SCHNEIDER AND BLAKER.
Tells Dr. Callen in
a Conscious
Moment.
Gives Affirmative
Sign to Names
of Suspects.
Sheriff Is Waiting
to Get Dying
Statement
OAKLAXD, July :Â«.-Coming out of
bin unconscious Â»truesle Tilth death
JuÂ«t long: enough to tell his doctors
that three men assaulted him and that
John Schneider and George Blaker, the
two suspects now under arrest, Trere
iwo of them, Thomas Cook relapsed
Into unconsciousness this morning and
has left Sheriff Frank Barnet and his
deputies Impatient for him to recover
â¢ufQciently to tell them more about the
murderous assault by the robbers.
Cook's condition, however, is so seri
ous that Dr. J. H. Callen would not
consent to allow Sheriff Barnet into the
room or attempt to interview him. The
patient's pulse Immediately increased
with his one effort to talk and the doc
tors fear that another, even slight,
would cause death. In his unconscious
ness Cook haÃ at times muttered things
and his every word has been attentive
ly listened to by his attendants in the
hope that he might say something
that would aid the Sheriff.
After spending a very restless day
yesterday Cook awoke toward morn
ing after a sleep of several hours and
attempted to talk. This he did with
great difficulty, as that portion of his
brain is injured that governs the
nerves having control of the muscles
of his throat. But by words and signs
he was able to tell Dr. Callen that
there were three men who assaulted
him. When asked their names he
* seemed to be unable to remember and
several were suggested to him and
finally the name of Schneider was men
tioned. Immediately he signified that
it was one of the names he wanted
and the same proceeding was gone
through with the second name until
finally the name of Blaker was sug
gested and again he said that this was
another of them.
purnzxT becomes Excrron.
The doctor, however, suggested a
number of other names, but not know
ing who the third might be finally
found his patient growing so excited
that he had to desist and shortly after
ward Cook again relapsed into uncon
sciousness.
With the first streak of dawn .Dr. Cal
len communicated the Information he had
elicited during the dark hours of the
nigrht to Sheriff Barnet, and as soon as
that official could get away from the
phone he sent out Deputy Sheriff Reilly
and Constable Tom Carroll to the homes
of Percy Pembroke and James Crow
hurst, both of whom are known to have
been with Schneider and Blaker Satur
day night. Before Pembroke had got out
of bed Constable Carroir was at his
home and took him into custody, and he
is now safely lodged in the County Jail.
Crowhurst has not yet been found and
it is thought that possibly he may have
' left the country.
Crowhurst was the first to be taken
into custody by Sheriff Barnet on Sun
day, as he was seen Saturday night in
the vicinity of where Cook was attacked.
He. however, seemingly told a straight
etory and identified the cap picked up
near the place as one that he had given
Schneider. He gave Sheriff Barnet such
other information as caused him to ar
rest Schneider and Blaker, and, having
nothing against him, the Sheriff finally
released his hold upon him. Crowhurst.
however, is said to be one of the worst
-Ja the gang and has been in many ques
tionable affairs with both of the others
and it is thought that without doubt
when Cook again Is able to talk that
the name of the third man will be either
that of Crowhurst or Pembroke.
PEMBROKE THIRD MAX.
The latter of these was also taken Into
custody by the Sheriff some days ago,
but he was able to account for all of
his. movements on the night In question,
even to admitting that he was with
Schneider and Blaker until after 8
o'clock. About that time, he said, he left
them and went home. In this he was
corroborated by his father, who said that
the son was In the bouse by 9 o'clock,
end on this showing he also was re
leased. The fact, however, that Schnei
der was with the other two and some
other information the Sheriff has, make
him confident that Pembroke Is the
man.
Asd while the Sheriff and his deputies
are feverishly working on their end of
the case. Drs. Callen and Crosby are
working night and day with their pa
tient. They have promised Sheriff Bar
net that he Ehall be present at the next
Interview if their patient recovers, for
the present Information is such that it
cannot be used In a court of Justice.
In this connection Sheriff Barnet had
the following to say on the subject:
"I have either to take Schneider; and
Blaker Into the presence of Cook and
have him identify them, or he must make
an ante-mortem statement to the effect
that he believes he is about to die, and
then state who the persons are who as
saulted him, or it cannot be used as evi
dence against these men now In jalL
While what the doctors have told me Is
encouraging to me, as It makes me sure
of my ground. It is worthless as evidence
and is purely hearsay. I am anxiously
waiting to talk to Cook and also to con
front him with the men I have In cus
tody and hear what he says, and If he
will only recover sufficiently to tell, the
case will be cleared up. .

PARIS, July 28.â France's relations with
Germany are again showing signs of
strain owing to the Inability of Premier
Rouvier and Embassador Radolin to con
clude a definite programme for the Mo
roccan conference. The agreement of
July 8 contemplated a Joint programme
but the arrangement of this programme
is causing renewed difficulty, particularly
in connection. with France's right to po
lice the territory adjoining Algeria and
supervise the maintenance -of order
throughout the empire. It is the French
view that these rights follow from the
agreement of July 8, whereas Germany
does not wish to define the extent of
French police and financial reform. The
indecisive status of the negotiations has
caused renewed apprehension on the
Bourse and the newspapers have renewed
their sharp criticism of Germany's course.

EXPERT LEAVES
UNDER A CLOUD
Dr. George T. Moore of f the
Departnient of Agriculture
Tenders His Eesignation
INVOLVED IN SCANDAL
Offers, Explanation of His
Connection^ With Soil Con
cern to His Superiors
WASHINGTON, July 25.-George v T.
Moore, physiologist and algologist of i the
Department of.- Agriculture, 7 to-day ten
dered his .resignation to Secretary .Wilson
and it has been accepted. 'This action is
the culmination of a hearing at the de
partment yesterday at which it was al
leged by two representatives of an agri
cultural publication that Moore's wife
held stock in. a, company manufacturing
culture for soil inoculation, while Moore,
who had charge of the preparation and
revision of bulletins regarding the en
richment of farms, directed the farmers
to the concern in question for their sup
plies of the culture.
According to Dr. Moore, a proposition
was made to . him in July, 1904, by per
sons living at West Chester. Pa., for the
formation of a company to manufacture
inoculating -material under patents tak
en out by the Department of Agriculture
in the name of Dr. Moore. He said he
told these men they would probably al
ways have competition with the Govern
ment and that in any event there could
be no monopoly of the business for. the
reason that the department had taken
the patents in a manner to prevent any
commercial discrimination. The West
Chester men were willing to take the risk
and offered Dr. Moore a salary and- an
interest in the business, with the under
standing that the company should have
the exclusive right to any further dis
coveries made by Dr. Moore.
After receiving this offer, Dr. Moore
says in his statement, he wrote to Dr.
Woods, his superior, telling him that his
prospects with the. new company seemed
better than he could expect from the de
partment. Woods then recommended a
raise of salary for Moore and said it
was ihe feeling of Mr. Galloway, - of , the
department, that he should complete his
unfinished work before leaving the Gov
ernment service.
In ' view of the letter from Woods and
one, he received from Dr. Galloway, Dr.
Moore says he let the matter run along,
pending some decision in the matter of
an increase of salary. When the com
pany was organized a block of stock
was made out in the name of Dr. Moore's
wife, for transfer to her husband when
he should enter the employ of the com
pany. Dr. Moore says he did not con
sider the stock could be his until he was
able to comply with the conditions, but
that he felt he could not afford to lose
his hold on the possibility of going with
the company as long as there was the
slightest chance of his not receiving the
advance from the department.
On December 17, 1904. Dr. Moore tender
ed his resignation, which was not ac
cepted, but Dr. Woods wrote him that
he thought the advance would go into
effect on January 17. Dr. Moore says it
did not go into effect until the following
April, and that if he had had any idea
the delay was to be so long he would
not have kept up negotiations with the
Nitro Culture Company. When the in
crease of salary was received. Dr. Moore
says, he returned the stock.
He 'declares also that the information^
given to the West Chester men had re
peatedly been given to other men. and
that there was no advantage or benefit
whatever to the Nltro Culture Company
and .there could not be 3 except through
this company getting the benefit of his
services and any further discoveries he
might have made. He never entered the
company's employ. "
Secretary Wilson and Assistant Secre
tary Hays, after going over Dr. Moore s
explanation, said that they had no criti
cisms of his action. , . \u25a0

SHARP DEBATE
BY ZIONISTS
Colonization Plan Divides
the Delegates Assembled
in Convention in Basle
TWO SCHEMES TAKEN UP
East Africa and Palestine as
Sites for Settlement Cause
\u25a0 Split Among the Members
BASLE. Switzerland, July CS.â The re
ports that rioting: occured at yesterday's
session ~bt the Zionist Congress are in
correct. This morning, however, while
the delegates were arriving In the hall,
considerable scuffling occurred in the
hallways and stairways. This caused a
scene of angry gesticulation and shout-
Ing. Blows were exchanged and the po
lice interfered and cleared the stairways
of the disorderly element.
The congress held a lively session over
the special order of the day, the estab
lishment of a Zionist colony in East
Africa. Delegate Greenburg reported the
details of the results of the expedition
to inspect the 'land offered for . coloniza
tion by the British Government. Green
burg proposed a vote of thanks to the
British Â« Government. Israel Zangwill
urged the acceptance of the British prop
osition, provided the unhealthy location
on the plateau of Guasso Ngischu" (com
prising 6000 square miles) be replaced or
extended to a more favorable location.
Sir Francis Monteflore warmly contended
for Palestine as a more proper site for
colonization. 4^.,' \u25a0
Owing to the Interest aroused in the
colonization scheme, over a hundred ora
tors have requested to be heard. The
Organization Committee sought to re
strict the debate to four orators. Dr.
Zyatkin of Paris introduced a resolution
providing for an unlimited debate, which
was defeated by a large majority.
Thereupon a small group began a noisy
demonstration, compelling President Nor
dau to close the session amidst a scene
of general agitation.
At the afternoon session the discus
sion on the colonization scheme was re
sumed and a number of conflicting pro
positions were discussed. Cowan of Lon
don and Leon, on behalf of the Ameri
can delegates, urged that Great Britain's
offer of a tract in Uganda be declined.
They expressed their conviction th.at
Great Britain, having recognized Zion
ism, would give her aid in securing a
tract in Palestine or that vicinity.
Other speakers argued strongly- in
favor^of the acceptance of the British
offer after a further survey of tfie
Uganda territory.
The congress thereupon resolved to
designate four speakers, each to be al
lowed a half hour for explanation of the
divers views held on the question. The
vote aroused a further turbulent demon
stration on the part of the minority
which, however, President Nordau even
tually pacified by a .promise to extend
the speakers' time limit. The discussion
will be resumed, and. it is believed, con
cluded, with a special session to-morrow
morning.

ENGLAND SHIFTS
A NAVAL BASE
Will Spend Big Sum on the
Firth of Forth, Which Has
the Advantage of Position
MENACE TO GEBMAXY
Change in Plans by British
Admiralty Regarded as
Significant at Present
LONDON. July 28.â 1n the course of a
discussion of the vote for naval work
in the House of Commons to-day. Lieu
tenant Colonel Arthur Hamilton Lee.
Civil Lord of the Admiralty, said that
the Admiralty had decided not to pro
ceed with the Chatham dockyard exten
sion, but Instead to push work on the
new base at Rosyth. Firth of Forth,
Scotland. The Chatham extensions, he
explained, in 1903 contemplated the ex
penditure of $22,500,000.
Explaining the reasons for this step.
Lieutenant Colonel Lee said .there was
a probability that warships in the future
would be fewer in number and greater In
individual power. Hence, the berthing and
docking space must be of the largest size.
The Admiralty had decided that Rosyth
possesses greater strategical and other
advantages than Chatham.
The Civil Lord of the Admiralty, prob
ably mindful of the sensation caused In
Germany by his speech at East Leigh
in February last, added that he did not
now wish to enlarge on the strategic ad
vantages of a naval base on the east
coast, as it must be patent to everybody.
The plans, he said, had been prepared for
a naval .base of the most complete de
scription so that extensions could be car
ried out as required. The initial works
would, complete in themselves, cost $13,
500.000.
In a speech at a dinner of railway men
in East Leigh In February. Colonel Lee
was quoted as having said that, in the
recent distribution of Great Britain's
naval forces, England had not so much
to keep her eyes on France and the Medi
terranean, but to look with anxiety to
ward the North Sea. and the fleets had
been so distributed as to enable them
to deal with any danger in that direction
should It occur.
BRITAIN WILL AWAIT
ACTION OF THE COURT
Decides Not to Dispatch a
Warship to Uruguayan
. LONDON, July 28.â The British Gov
ernment does not intend to dispatch a.
warship to Uruguayan waters or to take
other threatening action until the ap
peal against the sentence pronounced
against the Canadian fishing vessel
Agnes Donohue for alleged poaching
has been decided.
The Government, here regards the
sentence of three years" imprisonment
(not fifteen) passed on Captain Ryon
of the fishing vessel as monstrous, but
the Uruguayan court has agreed to hold
another trial and the authorities 1 here
are content to await the result before
proceeding.

CHIXA DOES NOT
SANCTION BOYCOTT
So Declares a Journalist on
Way to Attend Peace
Conference.
VICTORIA, B. C, July 28.â Dr. Morri
son, Keking correspondent for the London
Times, arrived by the steamship Tartar
to-day on hie way to Washington to at
tend the peace negotiations. Interviewed
regarding the boycott established by Chi
nese against American merchants and
merchandise In China he said he did not
think the movement would assume great
proportions. While It was- a boycott on
a larger scale than any previously at
tempted In China, it was without Govern
ment sanction, as had been alleged, and
at the end of June, shortly before he left
Peking, an imperial edict was sent to the
governors ana viceroys of provinces or
dering them to do what they could to
stop the movement In the larger Chi-'
nese cities it -was not considered that the
movement is sufficiently serious to cause
alarm.
Regarding the report telegraphed from
Shanghai that Japanese influences were
believed to be behind the movement the
well-known journalist said he did
not'believe this for an instant. Just now,
he said, the tendency was to blame the
Japanese for everything that took place
In the Orient From his own observa

undertakers telegraphed to the nearest
relatives of the dead men for instructions
regarding the disposition of the remains.

the bodies should be shipped at the^ Gov

bodies of the forty-nine boys which were
interred, unembalmed. in the little burial
ground on the hill, will be exhumed. Now

tives that upon request the bodies will
be disinterred and sent home at the ex

success. Another mining enterprise is the
mining of the bed of Clear Creek, Shasta

MINE WITJI A HISTORIf.
The Redding Searchlight reports that
the Gladstone mine, near Redding, in
French Gulch, is dropping twenty stamps
continuously in ore and that the regular
monthly shipment of . bullion from the
mine is ; between. $50,000 and $60,000. Not
many years ago this property was sold
for $7000 to cover - some scattering debts.
A Pennsylvania syndicate hau expended
a sum largely in excess of receipts in op
erating. The mine was seemingly un
profitable. History in California mining
was ready to repeat itself. The property
that was considred to be unprofitable is
reported to have yielded $1,000,000 since
it wan bought for $7000.. Shortly after the
sale at a very low price the running of a
short crosscut brought to light a large
body of good ore and the speculation in
Gladstone turned out to be excellent:
. There will be less danger in me deserts
of Kern, Inyo, Los Angeles, San Diego
and other counties in the future than
there has been in the past. The LOs"An

\u25a0The outout of gold In 1903 .from all the
dredges in California, according to the re
turns made to the United States Mint, was
$17475,719! The yield for * lÂ»02 was $567,0Â«5,
showing an increase of 5608.054 for IÂ»C3. The
returns for 1903. were from 25 dredges in the
Oroville district in Butte County, 3 dredges
in the Folsom district in Sacramento County.
T. dredge in Sisklyou County, 1 dredge in Trin
ity County and 1 dredge in Yuba County. Of :
the total for 1903, $1,320,098 came from Butte
County, meaning the Oroville district. There
will be an Increase for 1804 beyond the pro
portionate increase in ' the number dredges,
because the new dredges are of larger ca
pacity and" Improvements have been made in
the old 1 drednes. . , .^ a ._' \u2666
At the beginning of 1905 there, were in the
Oroville district 23 dredges; in Calaveras

dredges; in â¢ Shasta County, 2 dredges: in
Trinity County, 1 dredge;' in Sisklyou County.
1 dredge; !n Yuba County, 2 dredges; total,
40 dredges, as 'against 31 dredges for 1903.
Some of the dredges worked only part of
1903 having beÂ«n built during the year. Tak
ing into consideration the increased average
yardage of these dredges and the fact that a
number of new ones will bp in operation dur

VITAL. POINT AT ISSUE.
The California Miners' Association is
fully ready to test the Caminettl act in
the Supreme Court and the lawyers
are trying to expedite the matter. The
chief issue that the Miners' Associa
tion is trying to have made clear by
the Supreme Court is whether, a permit
to mine by the hydraulic process, is
sued by the -Federal Government
through its" representative, the Cali
fornia Debris Commission, la a final
permit or 'whether it can be vitiated
and set aside by the State courts. The
permit to mine has been the point of
attack by the Anti-Debris Association.
The whole matter is likely to get into
the Supreme Court of the United States
eventually. "President Benjamin of the
California Miners* Association says
that the body he represents "is anxious
to h&ve a decision aa soon as possible.
Judge Wickersham has delivered an
opinion at Fairbanks that is of much
importance to" the mining industry in
Alaska. The rights of tiie miner and
locator are described in definite terms
in part; as follows:
Discovery of mineral is necsesary to the va
lidity of a placer mining claim. If stakin*
and recording shall follow after the date of
discovery they relate bacK to the discovery,
and, in case . no - intervening rights have at
tached, perfect the claim aa of that date.
But It is not 60 with the discovery. If acts
of staking and recording are performed first,
as In this case, and discovery last, the validity
and life of the claim begin only with, the dis
covery. .The greatest evil in. the administra
tion of mining law In Alaska is the habit of
the shiftless In staking ana recording claims,
generally by power of attorney, whereby one
person out of ten acquires a claim to a large
area of supposed mineral lands and excludes
the willing miner front" working it and de
veloping the resources of tae territory. Since
the threat of lawsuit lurks behind each of
these ' pretended locations, ma â¢ proopector gen
erally passes It by. and thus the speculative
locator controls the property. -â¢"\u25a0--
Latest estimates make the cost of the
new drainage tunnel for the , Cripple
Creek district to be $750,000.' It. will
lower the water 741 feet below the
present, drainage level. Two years'
time will be needed to complete the
work.

Filed ;in San Jose Against
the Bay Cities Company
OPINION OF THE 'COURT
Judge Holds the Defendants
i Prerented : Proper Irriga
tion of Plaintiff's Lands
SAN JOSE. Jnly 2?.â Judffe Rhodes
to-dajr handed down his decision in the
case of Charles Miller against the Bay
Cltie3 Water Company, a suit to re
strain the corporation from impounding
or diverting the waters of the Coyote
River at or above the lower gorge. The
court holds that the plaintiff is en
titled to a decree perpetually enjoining
and restraining the defendant- com
pany . and Its officers, , agent 3 . and ,
employes from obstructing, arrest
ing or diverting at or above the 1
lower gorge of the river (except
for the reasonable use of the land 3
of the company in the. exercise of it 3
riparian rights) any of the waters of
the Coyote River which, except for such
diversion would flow on the surface of
the body of *the, river through thtj
gorge or would flow or percolata
through the gorge underneath the sur
face thereof, and that, plaintiff recover
his costs against the defendant.' '
Charles Miller, plaintiff, represents
all those fruit growers and -ranchers
whose lands lie north "-of the lowpt
gorge and south of the* bay. It was
contended that if the defendant was not
restrained the whole of the eastern
portion of the valley would h* <if~
prlved of Its essential supply of water
for Irrigation purposes.

LOS ANGELES, July 2S.â ln an effort
to secure an unlimited supply of pure
water sufficient for all future needs, Los
\u25a0Aiigtk-t; is about to begin v/ork on a sys
tem which from an engineering stand
point will be of greater magniutde than
any similar work in the world. The only
Eysttm which anything like approaches it
In magnitude is the Croton water supply
of New York, but here difilculties will be
encountered such as would not exist in
Hew York. ,
The scheme is to bring mountain water
from Owens Lake and River in Inyo
County, across deserts, through moun
tains and across plains a distance of 240
n.JKs, to give Los Angeles a supply suf
ficient for herjieeds when t?Â»Â» population
reaches the million mark. Engineers
have estimated that the cost of the work
will exceed $23,1/00,000, but that enormous
cost has not deteried the Board of Water
Commissioners ar.d Mayor McAleer from
beginning active work; in ract they have
been working eecretly for months. What
tliey have accomplished up to date Is of
gre2U-*=t importance. They have secured
en ootion on Owens Lake and a portion
ot the river draining it. They have made
a survey of the line of the ptopos con
duit and, what is more important, they
have, induced the national Government
to abandon a project of making Owens
Lake the center of a national irrigation
district and surrender it to Los Angeles.
The survey has shown that -all the
\u25a0water can be conveyed here by gravity,
no pumping plants being necessary. The
construction of nearly thirty miles of
tunnels will be necessary.

Man's Opinion of the Flirt.
No man admires a flirt; no man cares
tor a girl or woman who Is willing to
trade pride for flattery. The girl who
flirts thinks she is very wise and Is mak
ing a great hit with the fellow with
whora, Â«he flirts. She would have a very
different idea of the matter if she could
know, his real opinion â if she could hear
bis account of the Incident as he tells it
to the "other feller." There is no such
thing as a harmless flirtation. No per
son may put his finger in the fire with
out getting the mark. No girl can in
dulge in a flirtation without being con
sidered "cheap" and "shallow." The fact
that the other girls do the same thing
is no excuse. â Galena Republican. '

recently organized comprises E. B. Cut
ter, Sheldon Kellogg and Maurice
Block. .The first speaker Introduced by
Chairman Kellogg was , General C. A.
Woodruff.
General Woodruff, who is a veteran
of. the Civil and . Spanish-American
wars, urged the men of 'the district; to
watch, work and fight for success of
the ticket and pledged himself to vote
In convention for. a clean administra
tion. He pleaded for honesty, and. de
cency in public affairs and the election
of good men as delegates to show that
the decent element of the district Is
behind the delegation. .
Nathan C. Coghlan, the Assembly
mani was the next speaker, and he
dwelt upon the necessity of a strong
fight at the primaries. He spoke . of
the fairness with which the 'league
has worked/ In. the, district and' said
there would be no taint, or stain upon
the victory that will- come to it.
The remarks of Leslie Bennett were
most timely. He told of the disinclina
tion of business men to go even a. block
out of their way in the morning. to cast
a vote and added that if 'the ' vote was
not cast In the morning it would not be
cast at all. He also told of < the " new
arrangement of booths in the district
that seem to be placed with: a design
to I hinder the voters In" gaining; easy
access to the booth. '.*' ln some' precincts
the booths are on the very "edge -of ; the
precinct and . are only reached after
hills have been climbed.
Bennett also argued for the individ-

ual vote, which counts N heavily in the
primary fight. Although there are
enough now on the roll of the league
in the district to decide the fight vic
tory can only be brought . about by
every one on. the roll voting at the
polls. He then asked that volunteers
come forward for election work and at
the close of the meeting many re
sponded.
Maurice Block of the Grand Jury that
Indicted Wyman. Steffens and Reb
stock, then told of his knowledge of
municipal affairs gained through his
experience on the jury. He said' that
"there are- men to-day In the municipal
government of 'San Francisco who
would carry away the bricks of the.
City Hall if they could." The other
speakers were William A. . Sexton, the
Rev. Mr. Merritt, the Rev. Mr. "Wilson,
Philip Anspacher and L. M.' Fletcher.
The next meeting will be "held Friday
evening of the coming week.
HOLD ROUSING MEETING.
Republican* of Thirty-Eighth District
Turn Out la ' Big Numbers.
The San Francisco Republican League
Club of the Thirty-eighth Assembly
District held a rousing meeting at Jef
ferson Square Hall . last night. The
representative people -*"of the district
were there, among, whom were many
of the fair sex. There were 420 pres
ent Vice President Franklin B. Bull
was chairman, taking the place of
President Max Goldberg, who. was un
able to attend. Enthusiasm and ap
plause were the order of the.evening.
The big demonstration proved. 1 beyond
a doubt that the citizens of the Thirty^
eighth District -mean business and are
out for law and order.
Chairman Bull opened up the, pro
ceedings by a < rattling good talk. He
thanked the big crowd for. coming,
which showed by their presence that
they were' interested In the political
situation. He exhorted them all :to
keep up their enthusiasm and above
all things be on hand at the polls of
the primary election on August 8. {
Telling speeches 'were made by Sen
ator E. I. Wolfe and C. M. .Fickert.the
purport of which was that the munici
pality should be freed from the band
of grafters that now held full sway.
Both the speakers conceded the fact
that the coming battle was no easy one
and that the opponents were . allied
with shrewd arid alert workers. Wolfe
said that reports had been circulated
that he was the creature of Ruef. He
branded this statement as a malicious
falsehood/and added that he did not
represent Ruef in any way.
The following temporary officers
were elected as permanent 'officers of
the district: President, Max Goldberg;
first vice president, Franklin B. Bull;
second vice president, J. H. Curley; sec

started a propaganda to convert the
Mormons of Utah to the former prin

paign Smith has issued an open letter to

to abandon polygamy, commercialism and

ANTIQUES REGULARLY

Blake Large Profits Prom
the Isrnorant.
The rage for collecting, has grown stead
ily until the demand for.curlos, the craze
for. old glass and old prints and old furni
ture has become more and more acutely
keen. What could be picked up for a Â£1
note fifteen years ago, or even ten years
ago, now bring Â£10 or Â£12. The demand
for the antique having, therefore, become
so great that even suburban households
want their old glass and their old china,
the supply has, of course, become far less.
What is the result? The genuine /article
has become correspondingly more expen
siye. . , . '. .i .
Perhaps of all frauds that of. making
antique furniture is one of the most suc
cessful; so much so that even experts are
often deceived. Austrian . workmen are
particularly clever at this kind of work.
"Old" | Sheffield plate . is . another, well
known fake, and. even, as you can. get your
latch key. dipped in silver on the, Margate
Jetty for. threepence, so is the faked "old"
Sheffield ."dipped." . The design is first
made .in copper' and then dippedâ and,
needless to add, shows the copper beneath
after a few earnest applications of brusti
"and plate powder. When you think how
many years the genuine Sheffield will
wear and wash and clean^wlthout show
ing the copper beneath, this seems a par
ticularly wicked and vicious fraud on the
collecting public A partner In a high
class firm of Sheffield silver mills once
told my friend that they could easily
make Â£5000 a year more If they lent
themselves to copying â¢ "old plate,"
which Is now made with the sole In
tension of cheating the publio.
The would-be collector must be wary in
picking up old Sheraton brass- fenders
with" claw feet, as these can be made for
less than 12 shillings each, and a dealer
once boasted tom e, in a moment of con
fidence, that he did a thriving trade' in
them, and that his customers were de
lighted with their â¢ "bargains," especially
when jhe sold them a fine old embossed
tub or Jardiniere to go with their fender
on lion legs for "an extra pound!
Bow and Chelsea figures being always
expensive, even when copied, there is a
great and growing demand for Stafford
shire pottery, and our German friends are
supplying the demand 1 for this in the
shape of thousands of sheep, and cot
tages, and money boxes, and pastille
burners, . and greyhounds - and dogs ,of
every kind. These â costing â¢ sixpence to
aevenpence eachâ are eagerly snapped up
by the collecting public at 8 shillings each
and sometimes more.â Pall Mall Goxette.

COLLECTION OF PICTURES
OF JOHN PAUL JONES
Steel Engravings Mostly Caricature*
. o* the Fnmoui Ad
miral.
There has been * placed on exhibition
In the large reception-room of the Seo
retary of the Navy a small collection 1 of
steel engravings of Commodore John
Paul Jones. ' Many of these plates are
over' a hundred years old and while
some are complimentary to' the- great
American sea captain, the majority are
decidedly otherwise. It is believed the
most of these engravings were made In
France, and England soon after the
glorious victory of the Bon Homme
Richard over the British sloop-of-war
Serapls. They are mainly caricatures
and depict the great sea captain in
ridiculous attitudes. - :
\u25a0 In one of the picture* he Is repre
sented as a. regular pirate of the 'old
Spanish main type, with swarthy com
plexion and long black hair and- beard
streaming in the breeze. He carries a
cutlass in one hand and a big pistol
in the other. There are "â¢ several more
pistols In hla belt and he Is surrounded
by small cannon belching forth fire and
smoke. His costume Includes a leather
apron, on which is prominently dis
played the piratical symbol of skull
and crossbones. To add to the pioture
the ship. is on fire.- *
In another, engraving .Commodore
Jones is depicted as a Chinese . pirate
engaged in the mild-mannered occupa
tion of scuttling: a ship. .He has the
usual equipment of pistols and cannon
and battl e axes and Is surrounded by
aya v breastwork .of his many victims.
Another engravlng ( represents him In
the uniform of a Russian admiral and
two" or three show him in the uniform
of the Unitied States navy. There is a
general - similarity in the countenances
in all the engravings. Indicating that
they are probably based on . the same
portrait, i . - . â¢ ; "
Floating Nests.
"When the mother grebe is ready to
lay her eggs she searches out. some re
tired spot, among the reeds and rushes
of a lonely lak,e, and there scrapes and
pushes together a low heap of mud and
decayed reeds, says C. William Beebe, In
May Recreation. Here_ on this water
logged Islet â this merest semblance of
a. nestâ she broods her eggs. A moose
splashing among \ the nearby Illy pads
may send floods of water over the sit
ting bird, or the winds may disentangle
the little raft of reeds, sending it scud
ding to the farther end of the lake, but
the bright eyes of the mother bird never
falter. - She carefully ... covers her eggs
with decayed li leaves whenever hunger
forces her to leave them. Although she
does not weave the reeds, yet in some
way they, hold together until the last
little - grebe crawls to the edge - and
plunges; off head first.-' Or he may leap
upon I his mother's back and thus 5 ride

under sentence of death for the cruel
murder, of Dr. Engelke and Peter Ed
mlston on the desert of Lincoln County,
this State, several years ago,. does not
intend to go to the. gallows until every
effort has, been made to secure another
trial. Hancock was convicted several
weeks ago and until -to-day has been in
the condemned cell at the State Prison
awaiting . execution. This morning, in
the Supreme Court, an attorney made a
motion asking for ten days' additional
time in which to make a motion for a
new. trial. Hancock was thought to be
without funds to fight his case and for
this reason had given up the battle. It
is now understood rich Eastern rela
tives have come to his aid.

month or so. It la probable he will go
out on the next trip of the Hill Uaer Da
kota, for Chin -Gee Hee Is deeply. Inter
ested In the big steamships because of the
business relations he has maintained
with the Great Northern railroad for sev

The original purpose of Chin Gee Has
was tÂ« raise half a million dollars la this
country to finance the short line projected
in Canton province. The projeot has
grown and already Chin Gee Hee has had
subscribed more than H.500.C00. The origi
nal project called for about thirty. mflÂ«Â»
of construction witu an ultimate exten
sion a hundred miles farther to connect
with a road leading to Canton.
Since Chin oee- Hee began work oa his
big scheme he has been tendered a con
tract to construct 800 miles of new. road
which will tap a country south of his

mission to San Francisco is principally
to investigate markets. He is extremely

preference to the Coast. His agreement

MARINE TOADS PROVE V.
TO BE CANNIBALISTIC
Lot* for Flesh of Their Om Xlii
Gets Them Into
Trouble.
Tha muster roll of frogs to thÂ» aquar
ium ot the aoo has been decreasing of
late. Recently the cause was found
A cannibal frog (two of them In fact)
waÂ» at the bottom of the mystery. They
had been living sumptuously.
One day last week two giant marina
toads from the "West Indies went to
dwell in the aquarium. It was not
known at the time that they had canni
balistic tendencies. They came from the
New York too, but the donors must have
forgotten to warn the Philadelphia zoo
officials that the toads were fond of a
frog diet. Their reception in the frog
colony was marked w^th coolness.
Bull frogs and piping frogs alike eyed
the newcomers with distrust. They had
ample cause, as was later shown. One
by one the smaller frogs began to disap
pear. Two small alligators first came
under, the ban of suspicion. They were
removed. That night two more frogs
vanished. A turtle was next looked
on with distrust and removed from tha
frog tank. Still the small frogs contin
ued to disappear.
One day one of the marine toads was
caught red-handed. Keeper Bowers was
looking In the tank, when suddenly there
was a great commotion In the water.
The submarine ferns and grass waved
wildly. One toadâ the largestâ was hunt
ing and a small frog was swimming tho
race of his life. He lost and the bis
fellow seemed to smile as he gulped the
little one down. It will probably be the
last frog he will eat for a lons tlma
unless he decides to devour bis mate.
The marine toads are now In a separata
tank, spending their time looking regret
fully across the room at the home they
left.
Another rare toad arrived In this city
under peculiar circumstances last week
and the _ zoo Is now Us home. It, too.
Is a West Indian, but of tha tree toad
family. It made the Journey from Its
native land concealed In & bunch of ba
nanas.
T. J. Downs of 2363 North Fourth street
purchased a bunch of bananas and
placed them In his kitchen. That sight
his wife was awakened by a cracking
noise. She thought tho house was on
fire. Investigation disclosed the tree toad
walking up and down tha kitchen win
dows. As It walked tha cracking nolsa
was- made. On Its toes are little vac
uum cups, which enable It to hold -on tÂ»
a smooth surface. As the toad raised Its
feet the air, rushing into these tiny
vacuums, caused the noise.â Philadelphia

HOLDS THE FORT
Daughter of Aged Berkeley
Capitalist Fails to Get
the Family Furniture
STEPMOTHER IS FIRM
Mrs. 3facl)onald Loses in Tilt
With Her Fathers Bride
at Old Berkeley Home
BERKELEY. July 2S.â Mrs. A. H. Mac-
Docald Is not at all reconciled to the
marriage of her father. William M. Betts,
the aged Berkeley capitalist, with his
housekeeper, Mrs. Grace Forsythe, who Is
thirty-one years his junior. Outwitted
yesterday by the sudden marriage cere
mony while the petition to have the ven
erable Mr. Setts declared incompetent
v.a.s pending In the courts, the relations
between the daughter and stepmother
are not at all pleasant.
The first tilt between the two took place
just after the marriage ceremony, when
Mrs. Macl>onald called at the Betts
home, 2508 Telegraph avenue, and started
to remove furniture and \u25a0 bric-a-brac
which she claimed as her personal prop
erty. The new Mrs. Betts had already
taken possession of the house. The
groom was absent. â¢
Mi 6.- Mac Donald was gathering to
gether some of the family possessions
when MrÂ». Betts interfered. She refused
to permit her stepdaughter to take a
thing from the house until Mr. Betts re
turned.
"1 do not question your right to the
property; in fact, I know nothing cf your
claim." said the new wife, firmly but
gently. "You must not, however, remove
oiie thing from the house until Mr. Betts
returns. I cannot permit It."
At this uoint Chief of Police Vollmer
\u25a0was -consulted over the telephone. Mrs.
Mat-Donald objected to the obdurate ac
tion* of Mrs. Betts. Mrs. Betts explained
the stand ehe had taken. Neither party.
however, desired to swear to a complaint,
to the police dismissed the matter with
nothing more serious than a little advice.
but the trouble will not be ended when
Mr 6. Mac Donald recovers her property.
The petition to have Mr. Betts declared
incompetent is now in court and prooably
the aged groom's first task on returning
from his wedding trip will be to file an
- ewer to this petition. His wife asserts
that all the actions of the Mac Donalds
are prompted by the fear that, they will
lose their share of the capitalist's wealth
through the marriage with Mrs. For
cythe." When the proceedings come to a
Judicial hearing some interesting devel
opments are promised.
MOTHER WOULD END
* LOVE'S YOUNG DREAM
Pretty Miss Jorgenson Runs
Away and Angry Parent
Intervenes.
BERKELEY. July 25.-^Love . for her
en-eetheart proved stronger than love for
her mother in the case of pretty 17-year
old Annie Jcrgenson of West Berkeley
and three weeks ago she fled the maternal
roof and set out to make her own way.
She did not flee far, however, - but took
up her home on Fifth street with Mrs.
E. Hamilton, not many blocks from the
home of Arthur fcisterni, who professes
to love the independent lassie with last
ing affection.
Last nicht the mother discovered the
hiding place of her daughter and in a
belligerent mood sought out the Hamil
ton residence and demanded her child.
She was Informed that Miss Jorgenson
â¢was working in an Oakland candy store
and had not yet returned for the even
ing. Mrs. Jorgenson awaited the return
of the truant daughter and a stormy
scene ensued which only ended with the
v arrival of Policeman Atcheson. who was
hastily summoned by Miss Josie Sisterni,
Eister of the runaway girl's fiance.
Mrs. Jorgenson attempted first by per
suasion and then by force to get her
daughter to return' home, but the daugh
ter tstoutly refused. Then ensued a tussle,
and Mrs. Hamilton and Miss Jorgenson
became hysterical. At this point Josie
Eleternl rushed for the police and returned
with Patrolman Atcheson. The mother
appealed to the policeman and asked him
to take her daughter home. Miss Jor
genson was equally anxious that he
6nould remove. the bellicose mother. The
otneer of the law finally sided with true
love and advised Mrs. Jorgenson to re
turn without her daughter.

IN "TAG" GAME
Young Son of Mrs. Carroll-
Nicholson Plunges Thirty
Feet Down Embankment
HEAD STRIKES ON RAIL
Ybutli's Skull Is Fractured
in Two Places, and Opera
tion Proves to Be Futile
OAKLAND, July 2S.â Carroll Nicholson,
11 years eld, the son of Mrs. Lena Car
roll-Nicholson, soloist in the First Con
gregational Church choir, died this after
noon at Fablola Hospital from Injuries
he sustained last night by falling thirty
feet down an embankment on the Blair
Tract, Piedmont.
The boy with some companions was
playing on a hill above the bunkers at a
rock quarry owned by the Oakland Trac
tion Consolidated. While running across
the field away from one of his pursuers
at "tag" the youth struck a fence along
the edge of the bank with such force as
to break through a rail. Before he could
save himself he went headlong over the
edge and struck headfirst on a rail of
the car tracks thirty feet below.
Help was quickly at hand, a motorman
on an approaching car, stopping as he
rounded a curve just in time to prevent
further injuries. The unconscious boy
was taken to Fabiola Hospital, where Dr.
A. L. Cunningham attended him. His
skull was fractured in two places. An
operation was performed, but the case
was pronounced to be fatal.
Mrs. Nicholson resides at Park way and
Montecito avenue, near the scene of the
accident. Walter Nicholson, the boy's
father. Is in charge of the safe deposit
of the Oakland Bank of Savings. Cor
oner Mehrmann took charge of the case.
CHOIR TO CONSIST
OF SOLOISTS ONLY
First Presbyterian Church
Changes Its Entire Sys
tem of Music.
OAKLAND. July 28.â After much de
liberation the trustees of the First
Presbyterian Church have decided upon
an innovation that promises to awaken
widespread interest, not only among choir
workers, but in musical circles general
ly. They have concluded to do away
with the customary quartet of soloists,
whose voices are heard Sunday after
Sunday with a regularity that is bound
to grow monotonous, and will inaugurate
instead an entire volunteer choir, . In
which the choristers will also be soloists.
The splendid musical organizations In al
most all of the big churches of Great
Britain' and Canada are volunteer, so the
First Presbyterian is following a long
established and excellent precedent.
In every city there are many amateurs
with really good voices, who would be
an acquisition to any choir, but who do
not care to drudge in the chorus, year
after year with no opportunity for solo
experience. Oakland, the most musical
city on the coast, has many euch and it
Is the desire of Director Rowlands and
the trustees to -form such an organiza
tion as will attract the best singers on
Gmi side of the bay. During Mr. Row
lands' recent visit to London he made a
special study of choral and oratorio work
and will begin rehearsals with the new
choir primed with up-to-date ideas. The
first rehearsal will be at the church Sat
urday evening, August 5, and the trustees
have extended a general invitation to
elngers who desire to take advantage of
the new order of things to be present.

Hazel Wagner Home
From Pleasant
I otirnev. >
Only a Porter Was
Ugly and a Tip
Won Him. )
ALAMEDA,. July . 28.â From = Pueblo,
Colorado, to Alameda, California!/ . is a
long way for a little child to travel alone
by railroad, but Hazel Wagner, the nine
year-old daughter, of Mr. and Mrs. Gus
Wagner of 1522 Park street, has just com
pleted the journey. She naively relates
how she came all the way by herself
and only had to "tip" one porter. Hazel
was traveling with the Schenck family of
acrobats, but when the # troupe reached
Pueblo, from where they were to go to
Chicago, circumstances prevented the
child gymnast from accompanying them
and little Miss Wagner, was started on
her homeward trip. How that was made
is best told in Hazel's words: -
"When I got on the train at Pueblo the
agent at the depot gave me a note to
the conductors, telling them to be good to
me and see that* l did not get lost. All
the' conductors were kind and I was
never afraid that I would not get home
all right. I met some ladles on the train
who were nice to me, just like my papa
and mamma. There was one negro
porter who was just too mean for any
thing. I 'tipped' him with a dime and
after that he always grinned at me and
looked just like the picture of the black
cook who ate the breakfast- food."
Hazel will resume her school studies
here and later may go on the road again
with an acrobatic team.

Noted Civic Reformer Gives
Warning to Growing
San Francisco.
. BERKELEY, July 23.â Professor Gra
ham Taylor of the University of. Chicago
Theological": School, settlement worker
and , civic .reformer, delivered a lecture
on the "Industrial Crisis in Family Life"
at the First Christian Church last nigut.
He dealt with the leading problems of
the day in industrial life and discussed
the \u25a0 tenement evil ag it exists in large
cities. His lecture was under the aus
pices of the summer school in theology.
He said in part:
\u25a0 One most Important and far-reaching change
that has come about Is the' new position of
women. in the world. The marital equality of
woman- to-day has been' a great .gain to ; the
family life, raising It to a much higher, plane
than ever 'before. But one of the greatest
Improvements Is the! separation â¢of ' the shop
from the home,-- which- has done- more than
all else to make- toward ideal family life.
, I have not been here long . enough to form
an opinion on the San Francisco houses, but
I do deplore the building of houses on ' lots
covering every in.eh of â¢ ground. I notice that
the twenty-five foot, lot, one. of the greatest
of municipal dangers, .Is rapidly gaining
ground in your metropolis. You should grapple
with this problem now and not wait until
the future when it will be beyond you. ' No
house should be built without a place for
pure air and a bit of mother i earth. An
other feature about your city, which we would
r.ot tolerate for one instant in the East, ia
the building of bay-windows over the side
walks. The sidewalks are public and nothing
should be built over them. -I am very pleased
to pee that you have with you Architect Burn
ham. \u25a0 who is to do his best to remedy the
crowded house condition. He's the man to
do it. If any one can. â¢
BIG INDIAN GRAFT
EXPOSED BY WOMAN
Secret Service Detective, Posing; as a

. nnd Reports to Commission.
Facing nearly the entire Winnebago
Indian tribe, Indian Commissioner
Frankes Leupp has threatened to de
prive them of their' cherished dances,
all Government rations and to compel
them to work their lands unless they
desist from the ' debasing practices
which have completely enthralled them.
The Commissioner had a word for the
whites, who have been grafting on the
helpless but rich : tribe for years, ! The
accusations, said the Commissioner,
would be sifted to the bottom, and he
intimated strongly he had evidence to
warrant drastic measures. ; .
Indian agents, inspectors and other
Government officials, have fallen into
the net of border grafters and' the de
partment has had scandal after scandal
on its hands, but was never quite able
to make a thorough cleaning out of the
alleged debauchers and robbers of the,
reds. ; - \ . ; â¢
It was a neat trick therefore turned
by the new Indian Commissioner when
he sent a month ago a demure young
woman to teach in the Indian school at
the agency. Miss Scovel came as other
teachers had come and did her work
well. .
.But it has Just turned out that Miss
Scovel, ls in- the Government secret ser
vice and under instructions from Com
missioner Leupp. .; She has been able to
gather the best information yet ob
tained by the department, for- she has
seen much fromher unassuming posi
tion and learn ed much by sagacious
questioning. Not even the newly ap
pointed agent, Mr.' McFatrldge, knew
Miss Scovel was anything but a school

the policy of the citizens to keep such
places out at all hazards. The present

location of the restaurant is in the very
center of town. Mok Wo is backed by
the Six Companies and a prominent Chi
nese lawyer, who has been here and has
advised him to go ahead and open the
place. The Chinese are very anxious to

COWBOY GRILL
TO FACE JURY
Bound' Over to the Superior
Court on Charge of Mur
dering Sweethearts Father
GIRL AS A WITNESS
Miss Describes the Quarrel
That Led to the Death
of Her Aged Relative
Special Dispatch to T&a Ca!L .
HEALDSBURG. July 23.â Al F: Grill,
charged with the murder of "Winton F.
Pierce of Alexander Valley, waa given
a preliminary hearing: In Justice Pro
vines' court In this city to-day. Grill
was accused of having shot and killed
Pierce Monday morning 1 In his cabin
nine miles north of here. Grill was
arrested on suspicion and taken to
; Santa Rosa, where he was confined in
i the County Jail pending triaL This
morning Miss May Pierce, daughter of
Grill's' victim, in whoserv company the
accused was seen Sunday, was put on
the stand to testify. Several other wit
nesses were examined before the girl
was called.
May is 16 years old. She has. been
keeping company with Grill, who Is
30 years of age and a typical cow
puncher. The girl testified that on
Sunday night she hired a rig in Gey
servllle for Sunday and Monday and
arrived at her home at 6 o'clock. At 7
o'clock her father and Grill, who. had
been out hunting, returned. Pierce
then missed his purse and immediately
accused Grill of having stolen It. A
quarrel resulted. In which Pierce
cursed the young man. A dog had been
howling outside during the fracas and
Grill, noticing a shotgun leaning
against the wall, picked it up and said
he was going out to shoot the animal.
While Grill was out Pierce retired and
then decided to summon Grill to his
room. May called him In. -*
She says that her father, who was
In his night clothing, confronted Grill
and the argument was renewed with
increased anger. She left the two men
to themselves for a few minutes and
retired to the front part of the house.
In the midst of the discussion she heard
; the report of a gun and soon after
ward Grill came out to her. She in
quired what he had shot and he re
: marked in a casual manner that he had
: shot a "Skunk."
He then went out and brought the liv
ery rig up to the house antf told her to
get in. She did so and they drove over
to the home of Mrs. Phil Stoeffei. near
Lytton Springs. On the trip Grill handed
her a purse containing three |5 gold pieces
and two silver dollars. The girl claims
Grill did not tell her that he had killed
her father and says the first she heard
i of the murder was when she was told of
It by Sheriff F. P. Grace Monday morn
ing. Throughout the examination of the
girl Grill kept his eyes rigidly fixed upon
her face, quite unnerving her..
Mrs. Stoeffei. ' at whose home Grill and
the girl stopped.' testified that both vis
ited her place frequently and on several
occasions had referred to the cruel way
the girl's father, who seems to have been
a very cranky and gruff individual, treat
ed her. Mrs. Stoeffei said the girl paiil
her $1 50 for some sewing she had done*'
and then showed her the purse contain
ing the $16. When questioned by Mrs.
Stoeffei as to where she obtained It the
child said Grill gave it to her.
Several neighbors heard the shot and
saw the rig leave the Pierce home, but
thought nothing of it at the time. H. S.
Gird and TV. Bennet. who worked with
Pierce, missed him In the fields early
Monday morning, as the old man was an
early riser. Both became alarmed and
went to hl3 house. After knocking and
receiving no response they broke !n the
door and found the body of the old man.
Last Saturday Pierce" bought a.25-cent
pipe in Healdsburg and gave the dealer
a $20 gold piece in payment, receiving
three $3 gold pieces and the remainder In
silver change. It is believed that Grill
robbed the old man and committed mur
der to cover his deed. Justice Provinea
decided to hold Grill over without bail
before the Superior Court.

Elsie, the twelve-year-old daughter of

and promised a switching as well aa
ordering her to her room, went upstairs
and shot herself with- a thirty-elght
callber revolver, the bullet making a

fatally. It was undoubtedly lack of
knowledge of handling the revolver that
saved tne child's life. Instead of holding
It close to her head, she apparently fired
at the distance of a foot or more, as th*
bullet only grazed her skull.

Xot Practical Engineers.
There comes from the Orient a story a-hich
illustrates in less tragic- form than did the
Bennlnston disaster the need in the navy of
a marine engineering corps. It was a torpedo
boat. The captain was a Junior lieutenant
and the chief engineer an ensign. Something
went wrong with the engines and all the
engineering lore the young officers had ab
sorbed at Annapolis availed nothing toward
the solution of the problem. The warrant
machinist was as - much at sea as his su
periors and the torpedo-boat lay helpless.
Lying near by was an Occidental and Oriental
liner. The ensign-chief engineer boarded her
and told his troubles to the liner's chief
engineer, who offered -to take a look at the
torpedo-boat's engines.
The liner's engineer took one look at the
engines of the Government boat. In a few
words he told the ensign what was wrong
and how it could be fixed. It was ABC
to the marine engineer. Up to this time the
ensign had been most respectful and modest.
No sooner did he see his way out of his
difficulty than he straightened up as they
taught him to do it at the academy and in
patronizing tone remarked:
"Do you know, my man, that I believe you
are rlsht."
Hours afterward, on board the liner, the
chief engineer was overheard to mutter: "I've
been chief engineer for thirty years. I was
an engineer before that for more years than
I can now remember. And he 'believes' I
am right."
Crowded With Work.

ASA WELLS' WIDOW
GAINS A HOMESTEAD
Court Holds That She Is En
titled to Ellis-Street .
Property.
Mrs. Reba E. Wells, widow of the late
Asa R. Wells, has won her fight for a
homestead* on the Ellis-street realty left
by her husband. Judge Coffey decided in
her favor yesterday, thus defeating the
hopes of the adult children of the de
ceased and the petition of the executors
of his will for an order of sale of the
property. The children opposed the set
ting aside of the proprty to the widow as
a homestead on the ground that she was
already comfortably situated in the late
residence of the deceased and further
that the property to which she . sought
the sole right of enjoyment was in the
business portion of the city and not suit
able for a homestead- In disposing of
the contentions of the children and the
executors Judge, Coffey says:
Upon the facts in evidence it must be con
cluded that the premises sought to be set aside
constitute community property. The property
is not susceptible of partition. The widow Is
entitled to a homestead, even if it consumed
the entire estate, irrespective of the claims
of creditors, and notwithstanding that there
are no minor children.
Neither the deceased nor the petitioner se
lected a homestead during the litetime of the
deceased; and the only real property belonging to
the estate is the piece which the petitioner now
asks to have set apart to her as a homestead.
The property is appraised at $30,000 and is
suitable for a homestead. The five children
of the deceased â two girls and three boys, tha
issue of a former marriage â are all above 30
years of age, and the future of the girls 19
secured by property deeded to them of the
value of ?60,C00 or $65,000. There is no evi
dence that either of the boye labors under dis
ability.
, On the hearing counsel showed debts against
the estate amounting to 917.612 48. The ap
praised value of the estate is $51,558 67. The
petitioner married the deceased June 25, IS.SS',
and lived with him to the. time of his death.
The property sought to be set aside, as a home
stead waa purchased November 26, 1902. and
la community property.
' Upon this showing the court has no discre
tion to deuy the application, and the proof
justifies the court in decreeing that the appli
cant widow Is entitled to an absolute home
stead on the property and that the petition of
the executors for an order of sale be denied.

BUEGLAK TAKES TEST
> â
Sails for Australia With
Big Cargo of Lumber, Not
Being Allowed to Unload
Sea language in Us most vigorous An
glo-Saxon pnase was spouted vehemently
yesterday by Captain H. C. Davison,
master of the British ship Battle Abbey,
as she set sail out of this port for Fre
mantle, Australia. He had had trouble
with thÂ« Custom House and the Ship
owners* Association, and to crown all ha
discovered when he awoke in his berth
yesterday morning that a burglar had
entered his stateroom and stolen his gold
watch of "Lunnon make," his Australian
gold chain and anchor charm and several
dollars of loose change.
He was in bad humor also because Sur
veyor of Customs Spear had detected him
in a commercial fib and because he had
not been permitted to land about SO.OOO
feet of redwood lumber which he claimed
to be a dangerous overload. Representa
tions of the Shipowners* Association made
to Acting Customs Collector William B.
Hamilton \u25a0 estopped him from unloading
any of the Eureka redwood here. A sur
vey by the Customs Surveyor's offlc*
showed that when the Battle Abbey ar
rived from Eureka she had stowed away
between decks 537,352 feet of redwood lum
ber and that the water came up to six
inches of her Pllmsol mark. After Cap
tain Davison had shifted the lumber to
the upper deck the ship rode upon j an
even keel, and his representation that tha
vessel was unseaworthy was disproved
by that fact.
At the Oakland wharf the Battle Abbey
took into h.er hold 251.901 feet of yellow
pine lumber, 1610 pine doors and 30ft pack
ages of metal, with all of which she
sailed away as jauntily as a Stow take
swan.

SATURDAY ..JULY 29, 1805
THE CANTON-HANKOW RAILROAD.
A TELEGRAM from London announces that King Leopold of
Belgium has had an interview with J. Pierpont Morgan,
in which his Majesty strongly advised against the surrender
of the Canton-Hankow Railroad by the American-Chinese Develop
ment Company. Incidentally it is mentioned that the King is a.
iarge stockholder in the company. He regards retention of this
concession as determining the whole future of the white race in
Omna. and considers its surrender "under the scarce hidden in
timidation of the Chinese" as a fatal step. V v ;
The facts are that the concession is forfeited â¢ under its own
terms for non-compliance with its conditions. China has the right
io declare it forfeit and immediately take possession of the part
of the road that has been constructed. It is probable that Belgium,
the United States or any other Government would do this promptly.
But China, instead of standing upon her rights, proposes to pay a
large sum to indemnify the company, though it has forfeited all of
its rights.
-â¢ Just how his stockholding Majesty can see in this a "scarcely
veiled intimidation*' is not explained. The company upon such" part
of its road as is finished excluded Chinese from access to all parts
of its trains, and provided "Jim Crow" cars of a poor quality 'for
them to ride in. We are of the opinion that if the Japanese line
that runs steamers to San Francisco should compel all American
passengers to travel in the steerage, the ships would not be very
welcome nor long enter our ports. The case of the railroad is much
worse, for it is under a concession from the Government whose
people are treated with insulting inequality on its trains.
It is understood that China charged nothing for the concession,
and. that the indemnity it offers for the forfeited privilege reim
burses the company for all the money it has spent in the enterprise.
We have seen no proposition from Mr. Morgan nor his royal part
ner to pay China anything for a renewal of- the forfeited concession.
Instead of this they seem busy misinforming the world as to the
facts of the case.
â¢ The United States had some experience in railroad concessions
in the building of the Central and Union Pacific. And it is recent
history that it exacted the pound of flesh from both of those corpor
ations, its policy being quite different from that of China, which of
fers indemnity to a corporation that has defaulted in its undertaking.
..We hope the time has gone by when white men and their Gov
ernments could do as they pleased in China, regardless of the prin
ciples of. justice and the requirements of right. The future of the.
white race in China, as far as it has any business in that empire,
should depend upon the record it makes for honesty and fair deal
ing. Under the circumstances Mr. Morgan and his associates have
no case for an appeal to intervention by the United States. They
have not been denied justice. Their concession has not been taken
from them, though forfeited, and there is nothing in their situation
for treatment by diplomacy.
If they were dealing with any other Government they would
have been ousted immediately upon their default. They have no
reason for a campaign of sympathy in this country and Europe.
They made a contract with China and have defaulted on it. That
Government has not interfered with their performance of their
contract and has not capriciously annulled the concession. It would
be flagrant injustice for a superior power to coerce China under
such circumstances. Russia treated China as a weakling, forced
ber into concessions, took possession of Port Arthur, Dalny and all
Manchuria, and has been punished for her injustice and rapacity- by
defeat and loss of prestige.
Now let the United States set an example of fair dealing and
justice by letting Morgan and Leopold work out their own salvation
in China, in which event they will be wise to take the indemnity that
is offered, though they are in default. China is just as capable of
building her own railroads as Japan has been, and we have no
<loubt that she will build them, and that they will become as much,
factors in the world's commerce as if they were operated by Mr.
Morgan and paid rebates to the Standard Oil trust. The consider
ate world should rejoice to see China develop her own system of in
ternal transportation on modern lines, and operate it for the benefit
of her own people, for whatever benefits them helps the world's
trade with their country.
REID IN ENGLAND.
FROM the time that our diplomatic representative to Great
Britain was raised in rank from a Minister Plenipotentiary to
an Embassador a different tone has entered into his official and
social exchanges. Our first Embassador was Mr. Bayard. Having
occasion to do it, he accounted for his country and his countrymen
by telling the English that "Americans are too independent of
spirit and too self-willed to be governed by any power but them
5 seJves."
. i \u25a0 Our Embassadors have since been on easy terms with the
British Government and people, and in all their utterances . there
is a polite note of that self-will described by Bayard. Mr. White
law Reid,- who has just succeeded Mr. Choate as Embassador, is
almost a Californian, since it has long been his habit to come to
California to recover the health he loses in New York.
. At Embassador Reid's first state dinner in London Mr. Bal
four, the Prime Minister, spoke at some length about what. ought
to be between the two countries. Replying, Mr. Reid said : "Of.
course we ought to be on good terms â why not? Let us put it a
little differently. We are on good terms.. Why not? What con
ceivable reason is there now why our two great branches of the
English-speaking family should not be, as they are, actually- en
joying the friendly relations we are told it is our duty to bring
about. That is their normal state â that has been .increasingly for
a good many years their historical state."
After-dinner orators may regret that a theme has been done
to death by this simple statement of fact. Mr. Reid says in
effect, "Yes, we are full grown, equal and on easy and friendly
terms with you, so let's quit talking about doing something to
create what already exists, and see if. there is something for us
to do in advancing the peace of the world and promoting justice
among men."
It was a needed declaration, well put, and made the impression
that an original thing always makes.
THE PRESS OF THE NATION.
"I understand," says the Hon. "Big Tim" Sullivan, speaking in Lon
don, "that the King is a great fellow. He sticks to his friends, and that is
the test." This is the Bowery's first open indorsement of the. British
throne. It should promote measurably the broadening of the Anglo-
American era of good-feeling. â New York World. :â¢ .
We are interested to note that yet another minister has gone on the
stage because he feels that he will do more 'good there than in the pulpit;
also that he has had no previous experience as an actorâ Boston Trans
cript.

THE THOUGHTFUL MAJf A-VD AVO
3IKN.
<<\/OU remember," said the thought-
I ful man, "when* Rev. Anna- B.
Shaw found a perfect man right
here in California, little ' as anybdViy
might have suspected it. The poor
man's name was Professor Griggs, and
when Miss Shaw mentioned it right out
in meeting a burst of merriment went
up from, the newspaper, offices of the
State. You might, have thought that
hilarity was < genuine, but it was not.
It was caused by the corroding canker
of envy. The editors heard Miss Shaw's
pronouncement, and first they sort of
turned pale, and then they went â¢ over
to see Professor Griggs. The most of
them never, had met the perfect gentle
man, but they would stand off at a dis
tance and inspect him carefully and
then would say. 'What, that!' and after
that they, would go home and hunt up
a mirror. At length they would turn
away from the mirror with a long sigh
and say. 'Well, she never met me. Al
most anybody could understand it.'
Still the canker corroded, and so they
would give orders to have the bursts
of merriment continued.
"However, this is reminiscent, and the
subject has been recalled- to my mind
by the fact that Miss Shaw again is in
town, and again she has said some
thing worthy of note, as she always
does* Her most recent remark that .
struck me forcibly was this: .
'"What a Joy sitting on anything
would be to some poor women I know!'
".You bet it is! I know, some of. those,
poor women, too, and it is 1 surprising
how well thÂ«y like to sit on something.
I recall such a woman â¢ now. Her spe
cialty was . sitting .on . her husband.
Sometimes she would sit down on him
real hard: She was a little bit- of a
woman, and he was about* six feet tall
and built accordingly, but after she had
sat on him as she knew how, he would
look as* if he thought he might crawl
out through the keyhole. Oh; she was a
sitter, all right, and, to adopt Miss Shaw's
words, she evidently found great joy
in 'sitting on anything* or anybody. A
person might suggest a plan for the pub
lic entertainmentâ she'd sit down on it.
Her husband might mention that he
would like to wear his. other suitâ she
would sit down on the plan and. him, too.
Oh. she was a great sitter!
"I don't know; why I have dwelt on
this subject as I have; only, 1 think that
when anybody says a good and J true
thing, as Miss Shaw has in this instance,
somebody ought to say. v 'Amen!' and
that's what I'm shouting oow. You bet
there are women who find joy ineittlng
on anything or" anybodyâ some of us
know it." , \u25a0'. ' \u25a0 \u25a0 â¢'.'' ..-

BEAUTIFUL PALACE OF FORMER EMPRESS
TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO A CASINO
FROM Corfu, comes the news that It
is proposed to acaulre the palace
which for a time was the home of
the unfortunate Empress Elizabeth
of Austria, and open it as a casino, says
the London Graphic. The villa' itself
may, in many ways, be suited for such
a. purposed but on sentimental grounds
many "will .object to the transformation
of a house so Inseparably surrounded by
tragic j and sorrowful memories, '* Into a
house of playing, dancing and ; general
merriment. : It was at one of the saddest
periods In her career that | the late ! Em
press â¢of Austriaâ a wanderer on tne face
of the garthâ "first became enamored of
lovely Corfu."Â» The author of "The Mar
tyrdom of an Empress." who appears to
have . accompanied the unfortunate lady
in her exile, gives the following descrip
tion of the house in \u25a0 which v Elizabeth
sought "the consolation usually ", brought
by beautiful scenery, coupled with per
fect rest and estrangement from' all social
noise -and turmoil": â¢
"The attention, of the Empress had
been directed to the' classical spot where
the villa now stands," writes the author,
"by the late Freiherr yon Warsberg, the
great authority- on the landscape scenery
of the Odyssey. Within the incredibly
short time of. a little more man one and
a half years the modest Villa Bralla, on
the Gasturl Hill # In" the Island of Corfu,
long known for' its enchanting position,
was replaced,' under the direction of the
Italian architect, Rafael Charito, by a
palace, conceived and carried out in the
spirit of ancient Greece. The eastern
slope of the hill, facing toward the sea,
is covered with olive plantations,' while
the opposite incline has been laid out as
a beautiful park, on wide terraces. The
principal entrance is on the south front,
which, with its projecting porch, its log
gias and balconies, presents an exceed
ingly picturesque â¢ aspect. The vestibule
is connected with a- large, sumptuously

CAPTURED AMERICAN FRIGATE, PRESIDENT,
IS NOW AN ENGLISH RECEIVING SHIP
LYING in the river Thames is a
frigate captured by the British from
America in 1815. Its name is the
President.
Few persons knew of the existence of
this old vessel until the other day, when
Lord Charles Beresford, commander In
chief of the Mediterranean squadron,
hoisted his flag at her peak to signify
that he had assumed his new charge.
The story of how the President came to
be a British prize is interesting. She
was surrendered to overwhelming odds
by Captain Stephen Decatur outside
Sandy Hook, having been cut to pieces
In a battle with a superior vessel and
then surrounded by four others. Escape
\u25a0was utterly out of the question, and so
her flag was hauled down.
."Hands, Across the Sea" may get a
rude shock now that the case of- the
President has been made public. There
may be, however, a way to save the Jar
by persuading England to hand -back the
captured frigate. . She was : a splendid
ship whenÂ»built and might now be able
to come across under proper convoy and
care. f; - -\u25a0â¢ . ..:..â'":., .".\u25a0'." I U V
\u25a0'' Friends of Lord Charles Beresford who
have heard him in his "blood is thicker
than water" speeches here may not like
the idea of his flag flying from an Amer
ican prize vessel, but "Conder Charlie"
would-be the first to voice the opinion
that she might be 'returned if possible.
The President was one of the largest
of the American frigates, rating forty
four guns and carrying a large crew. Her
first affair of importance was her en
counter with tha British sloop-of-war
Little Belt, in command of Captain Bing
ham. off the Capes, on May 16, 1811: The
President was then commanded, by Com
modore Rogers, and, while none of her
crew was killed and only oneâ a boy
wounded, the British sloop lost thirteen
killed and nineteen wounded.
The surrender to the British of the
President took place on January 16, 1815.
Two* days before, under command of
Captain Stephen Decatur, . the President
had dropped down from the' city to
Sandy Hook. During the night she; made
an attempt to cross the bar and put to
sea.- From some cause never explained
the pilot missed the channel and ran the
ship on one of the shoals ' which ob
struct the harbor, and for five hours she
was detained. i. . ; .'. \u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0.':
As a squadron of British ships had
been blocking the harbor for several
weeks and had been blown off by a gale,
the opportunity to run the .; President
outside had been seized by Captain De
catur. The mishap caused by the pilot
was therefore particularly unfortunate,
resulting as it probably did in the loss to
America of the fine frigate. *
Early on the morning of January 15,
while Captain' Decatur was heading
southeast by east, he made out three
strange sail, all within shot and all di
rectly ' ahead -of the . President. -The
American vessel then was hauled up and
passed to the northward, three miles
distant. " ' x '
When the day came it was found. that
there were four ships, in pursuit of the
President: Two were astern and one on
either quarter* The v nearest ship " was
only three miles away. A *. \u0084

and heat once took steps to lighten his
i ship. Anchors were cut away, water j
casks emptied, provisions, cables, spars,
boats and all other articles that could
be spaced were thrown overboard.
From the royals down the sails were
kept wet, but as the wind was light
and elusive the pursuers gained stead
ily.
At 3 o'clock in the afternoon the
nearest ship was. close enough and
opened fire with her bow guns. At 5
o'clock, having won a place within half
point blank shot distance, she was able
to* bring into use all her guns, but
neither those at the stern nor on the
quarter of the President could be
brought to bear. \
Fornearlyan hour the President en
dured the galling fire, each shot carry-
Ing away some of her rigging. Then
Captain; Decatur determined to act and
his crew cheerfully agreed with him. j
The President's helm was put up ana |
her course changed so that she could
get in close quarters .with her oppo
nent. The Englishman understood the
scheme of Decatur and kept off, the
ships meantime coming abeam and each
delivering a broadside.
Then for two and a half/ hours the
combatants, a cuarter of a mile apart,
ran dead ahead, but whenever the
President made! an attempt to close in
the enemy sheered off. so that the ac
tion was altogether with the heavy
guns. Spars and rigging were aimed at
on either side, but the . President's
marksmen appear to have been the bet
ter, as at 8 o'clock the stranger was
dismantled, "her sails being cut f rom\
her yards," as Decatur afterward re
ported. .
The damaged ship then fell astern,
while the President made an effort to
repair the damage done and to shake
off the three other pursuers, which by
this time had been joined by a brig.

of them, at once began battle within
musket shot distance, while the Tene
dos. within two cable lengths, and the

Surrounded by a force vastly superior
; to his own and with one-fifth of his
crew either ' dead or crippled, and his
ship in such condition that to sail away

indicate his purpose.

culiarity of topography as our desert,
namely, a mines altitude of from 0 to

because of difficulty in dealing with the

scheme presented by the digging of
the Suez Canal.

By a mutual agreement between , the
members: of the Typothetae the eight-:
hour workings schedule will be "restored
ito the printers . and pressmen s of San
Francisco. The demands of the r Typo
graphital Union were met with much op
position, but in the end . the . plea : was
granted. Ever since July 1 the men have
been locked out, but the full strike bene
fits were paid them from the treasury of
the local union, and! the inconveniences
caused will be fully repaid by success in
the fight.
A great improvement in the methods
of fighting the lockout was made by the
Typographical Union, for at no time was
any personal violence used, and the men
did not resort to the objectional boycott.
Many offers of support were received
from the, brother crafts, but. the men felt
themselves strong enough to win without
aid and were successful.
It was announced yesterday that the
following firms had conceded the shorter
working hours to their employes: Barn
hart & Swasey, Illinois-Pacific Glass
Company, Julius Gabriel, E. C. Hughes,
A. Meyerfeldt, Levinson Printing Com
pany, Louis Rocsch and the Mutual Label

By this action it is said that all the
members of the Typothetae in San Fran

hour day irrespective of union or non
union labor. .

AUDACIOUS AMERICANS
'...-â¢. PHONES KING EDWARD
Monarch'" Answers From "Ascot anil
Grants l*ermi*sion;. to - "Do"'
Buckingham Palace.
King Edward â¢ never lets a chance
slip of doing anything that tends
to promote friendly relations be
tween England and America.' That was
strikingly illustrated by an incident that
occurred the other day, the particulars
of which I have just heard. Incidentally,
also, it Illustrates what American au
dacity can accomplish. Armed with a
letter from Henry White, formerly First
Secretary of the American Embassy in
London and now Embassador to Rome, a
party of Americans called at Bucking
ham Palace to "do" the royal residence
and the royal "mews," as aristocratic
stables are termed here. The letter suf
ficed to get them shown over the stables,
where they were able to feast their eyes
on the King's horses and carriages, but
were told that they could* not go over
the palace itself without, a permit from
the ljord Chamberlain, that being an in
flexible rule where foreigners are con
cerned. Earl Clarendon fills that office.
He was out of town, and none of the
palace officials knew where a message
would find him. Apparently the difficulty
was an insurmountable one. It would
certainly have been deemed such by any
but Americans. One .of ,the party sug
gested that the Lord Chamberlain's per
mit might be dispensed with by obtain
ing the consent of the- King himself.
When the palace official had recovered
from tho shock this caused him, he ex
plained, \u25a0 that that also was impossible,
as the King was attending the races at
Newmarket. Not one whit abashed the.
spokesman~-of the party inquired if he
could not be communicated with by tele
phone. When the official had again re
gained his breath, he admitted that It
was possible, and that the palace con
tained a telephone, which could be
switched on to any place where His
Majesty might be staying, but there was
no precedent for employing it for such
a purpose. Apparently another impasse
had been reached. However, after a good
deal of palavering the persevering Amer
ican succeeded in reaching the young
man in j charge I of, the palace telephone.
It tooK some time to bring him around,
but finally he decided that : he would
'/risk it," though he declared emphat
ically that he would never have dreamed
of doing a thing so unusual for any but
Americans.
It did not take long to obtain a reply.
If the Americans were properly authen
ticated, they were "by . His.. Majesty's
commands" to be permitted to go. over
the whole palace without being subjected
to any Irritating scrutiny. .That settled
it. They "did" the palace most thor
oughly." and the attendant flunkeys coula
not have shown j more "consideration to
them , had they been personages of royal
blood. When they had finished sightsee
ing they were. 'lnvited to "partake 'of
luncheon In the palace by one of the big
wigs attached" to his Majesty's,-house

GIRLS CHARGED
WITH ROBBERY
Dance Hall Inmates Accused
of Stealing $800 From
Pockets of Henry Puyne
EARNINGS OF YEARS
Gomes From the Sawmills to
Have Good Time and Now
Finds Himself Penniless
Mamie Burns and Mattle Rodgers, two
Itinerant habitues of the Kearny street
dance halls, were arrested last â¢ night by
Detective Edward Wren for the alleged
robbery of $800 from Henry i "Puyne, , a
sawmill employe from Southern ICalifpr
nla. The girls were charged on the det
inue book until an investigation can be
made, as none of the stolen was
found on them whensearched. . ,
: Overindulgreii'. c in tlie pleasures of the
Barbary Coast for the last few days was
the cause of the loss of < which Puyne
complained. In all hfs wanderings among
the light-fingered element, he claims, he
had retained the sum intact in his pocket
until last night. He said the money
was in twcnty^dollar pieces and repre
sented the savings of four years of work
on a farm near Schuylkill, New' York.
During the months he has labored among
the sawmills of San Bernardino County
he says that the money was always car
ried in his pocket because he- feared to
trust a bank. Probably this' fact-In
creased his chagrin when he..; was re
lieved of It so easily in a drinking hall.
The police think it likely that Puyne
misrepresented the amount of money he
had. The evidence of some of his as
sociates in seeing the wonders of the
Coast resorts point to the conclusion that
he spent what he had.
Puyne told the detectives that he earn
ed $35 a month in the sawmill, but that
the $800 was made on the New York
farm, he having saved the earnings at
the mill to spend in this city.
To-day Acting Captain Reynolds will
question the Burns and Rodgers women
about their connection with the alleged
crime.

AN OLD LOCOMOTIVE : E^
RECALLS EARLY OREGON
First Railway Engine In* the State
Sent to the Portland
Fair. â
There has lately been donated | to the
Lewis and Clark centennial exhibition an
old locomotive which has had a decided
ly interesting experience. It was built in
San Francisco in 1861. when the old Vul
can Iron .Works of San Francisco re
ceived an order from the Oregon Steam
Navigation Company for a locomotive for
use on a portage that extended around
the great cascades of the Columbia
River.
â¢ The portage consisted of a seven-mile
stretch of track, laid on the bank of the
Columbia on the Oregon territory side.
The first trip of theNlittle engine was
made May 10, 1862. The track consisted
of stout wooden rails laid longitudinally,
which y were covered on -the inner edges
with light scrap iron plates. '^' ""*'*
The operating company was the subject
of much congratulation on the day that
the engine drew its first load' of freight
and passengers around the portage at the
rate of ten miles an hour.
It was not long before a more up-to
date road, with larger cars and more
powerful locomotive, wasÂ» built on the
opposite side of the river, and with the
completion of the new road the old por
tage track and Its locomotive were dis
pensed with. :>^' : ' \u25a0'
The "pony." as the little engine was
called, was then purchased ' by a San
Francisco contractor and brought by
steamer down the Columbia and around
the Pacific' coast to that city, where it
was engaged for many years In hauling
the sand cars that were used on a largo
contract for cutting down the steep hills
and filling up the foreshore of San Fran
cisco.
After many years of this service the
engine was taken off the work and stored
in a warehouse, where in 18S9it was
seriously damaged in a fire which de~
stroyed the warehouse. !
The engine is about seven feet in width
and thirteen in length and weighs five
tons. It is carried on four -wheels, con
nected by side rods. The cylinders are
not connected direct to the driving-wheel
axle, but drive the latter by means of a
countershaft to which -it is- geared. âChi

"A friend of mine down in one of the

the people in the mountain country

SPORTS
ANGLERS KEEP
UP GOOD WORK
Reports From Northern Part
of the State Say Sport Is
Better Than in Many Years
BIG CATCHES ABE MADE
Run of Salmon Has Ceased
at Santa Cruz.. Monterey
and Capitola for Season
The fishing season this year bids fair
to break all records both for the quan
tity and quality of the fish that are be
ing taken daily by the anglers. Dur
ing the last week reports from the
northern part of the State have lured
many away from the cares of the city,
\u25a0while those who have Intended to make,
but short stays have decided to stick
while the sport continue* so good.
The upper Sacramento River is a
mecca for anglers at the present time.
The trout are running there as they
have not run in years and every day
splendid catches are reported. The
weather there Is about right for trout
and bids fair to hold out for some time
to come.
Around Shasta Springs the best
catches are being made. Floyd Judah
of the Southern Pacific has been fish
ing there for several days and has been
sending many boxes of choice trout to
his friends in this city. Judah manages
to hook as high as forty fine trout a
day. He took several on files that went
as* heavy as two and a half pounds
each. He says the best flies are the
royal governor, Yosemite. royal coach
man and gray and brown hackle. The
spoon may also be used there with good
success.
Fishing along the Truckee River is
the best in years. Many anglers made
the trip there last week and they all
reported the sport to be the finest they
ever experienced in that section of the
country. The supply this season seems
inexhaustible, having held out so far
without the slightest signs of let
ting up.
The best catches of trout are being
made above Boca. At the present time
workmen are engaged in cleaning an
ice dam below this place and as this
makes the water muddy the trout arc
all- beading for the clear parts of the
river several miles north of the dam.
The best flies there are the Cahill, blue
upright and shane.
Jeff Wells. J. Fountain and Joe Do
ber are having all kinds of good luck
there. They are all stopping at Boca
and 6ay that every time they want a
mess of fish all they have to do is to
make a trip above, the ice dam and
cast their lines.
Salmon are beginning to run along
the McCloud River and fly fishing will
be slack there for a while. When the
salmon spawn the rainbow trout fol
low them and eat the spawn. Conse
quently they will not take flies except
in the early morning and late Jn the
evening and even then it is hard to
land them.
The sport at the Big Meadows con
tinues good. Sam Wells is still there
and reports excellent luck. He says
the trout are taking grasshoppers and
also hair lug flies. Big Springs, Ham
ilton Branch and Spring Branch are at
tracting many fishermen and the trout
are running well at these places.
Ballards Lake is still good for black
bass. Many large catches have been
reported there during the last week.
K. J. Kaplan, accompanied by his wife
and daughter, are at Hilton on the Rus
sian River. Kaplan is hooking the
fish in rapidly and last week sent down
several boxes of nice ones to friends
in this city.
The San Francisco Striped Bass Club
will give an outing at Lake Merritt to
morrow. Charles Breindenstein will
Tie the official chef. Doc Watt will act
sis master of ceremonies and Joe Uri
will preside as head man at the big
feed. Lively doings are promised.
The run of salmon at Santa Cruz,
Capitola and Monterey has about
stopped. The sport there held out very
well for several weeks, but It is over
now for the season.
Next month good sport is promised
at the mouth of the Soquel Creek, near
Capitola, when the steelhead commence
to run. Already many anglers of this
city are getting ready for the opening.
â¢The bass fishing in and about the
local bays and lagoons^has been very
poor for a couple of weeks past on ac
count of the bad weather. ThÂ« buss
will not come to the surface while the
fogs and winds continue and there has
been many a disappointed fisherman
seeking them last week. Should the
weather loom up warm next week good
sport is assured In this line.
During the past two months- about
600,000 trout have been distributed by
Game Warden Reed in the streams of
Santa Cruz County. There are over
400,000 fry still at the hatchery to be
distributed In the other streams of the
county, making about 1,000,000 this
year.
It Is proposed to have the adjoining
counties get the benefit of the hatchery
by paying toward its support and then
getting their share of the fry.

CHICAGO, July 28.â The yachting sea
son will reach Its climax when the fleet
of the Chicago Yacht Club and the repre
sentatives of the Detroit and Cleveland
Yacht clubs cross the lines to-morrow
afternoon In the start of the long cruis
ing races, the former at Chicago, the
Litter at Port Huron, both bound for
Macklnac Island. Four splendid schoon
ers, evenly matched and well represent
ing the two types of craft popular on
fresh â¢water, a half dozen powerful cruis
ing yawls and several racing sloops will
race In their respective classes with ten
minutes between the classes.
The distance is 340 miles and it was
covered last year In thirty-two hours,
running before a southerly gale. Very
high seas were running- at the north end
of the lake and there were many acci
dents to spars and rigging. It is not
thought probable that this record will be
equaled this year, although there are
Indications that there will be plenty of
wind. 6s$QPKBUHlfeORfi
The only limitation of rig Is the barring
of club topsails. . The closest race will
probably be between the four schooners,

Commodore T. Jennings Will

CHALLENGER RETURNS
Yachtsmen Are Beginning
to Make Ready for the
Big Race on Admission Day
Commodore T. Jennings' flagship
Speedwell, accompanied by a fleet of Co
rinthian yachts, will cruise this after
noon and evening to Petaluma draw
bridge As the tide begins to flood at
3 this afternoon at Fort P&int. it serves
well for a run up the bay. The annual
up-river cruise of the San Francisco
Yacht Club having ended last Sunday,
to-day and to-morrow are open dates on
the programme of the Sauaalito tars, but
many of the yachtsmen will take ad-
vantage of the favorable tide and will
run up the bay to Paradise Cove, Marin
islands or McNears Landing. The tide
ebbs from 11: IS a. m. to 3:48 p. m. to-mor
row at Fort Point, so that a return to
moorings in good season is assured.
The flagship Challenger returned to
Sausallto last Sunday from her annual
up-river cruise, which was much enjoyed,
the yachtsmen finding plenty of water in
the river, good breezes and few mosqui
toes. Starting from Sausalito on Satur
day the Challenger, Ariel and Merope
made Army Point that night and Isleton
on Sunday. On Monday the yachtsmen
reached Walnut Grove, where they stayed
till Wednesday, proceeding to Courtland.
After cruising around Courtland, the
yachts returned to Walnut Grove on
Thursday, Holm and Rousseau in the
slocp Merope sailing to Napa. On Friday
the Challenger went to Toland's Landing
and next day to Vallejo, making moor
ings at Sausalito on Sunday. The sloop
Ariel, with A. C. Lee and party on
board, continued their cruise up the river
and -reached Sacramento. It is expected
that the Ariel and Merope will return
to Sausalito to-morrow. The yawl Gyp
sie of the California Yacht Club has been
on a cruise up the river, dropping anchor
at Sacramento. She will probably return
to Oakland Creek to-day.
The race of the California Yacht Club
for the Wallace trophy, of which the
Floop Thelma is the present holder, has
not been held this year, J. J. Sherry's
new racing machine, Perhaps, and T.
Kendall's sloop Alert, two of the princi
pal contestants, having met with mis
haps. It is expected, however, that the
regatta committee will make arrange
ments for the annual race to be held
soon.
Yachtmen are already beginning to
think of the annual regatta of the Pacific
Interclub Yacht Association on Admis
sion day. Commodore W. G. Morrow has 'â¢\u25a0
appointed ' Roy C. Ward, Dr. L. P. Rlx
ford and H. G. Toll the regatta cpmmlt
tee to reoresent the San Francisco Yacht
Club as delegates to the association. The
directors of the Corinthian Yacht Club
have appointed T. J. ICavanagh, F. E.
Schober and M. J. Brennan as their dele
gates. P. J. Wenljcer and Carl A. Sle
brand have been appointed delegates of
the Vallejo Yachting and Boating Club.
The California and South Bay Yacht
clubs remain to be heard from. The an
nual meeting to wind ud the affairs of
the association and organize the new
body will be held soon. It is probable
that the alteration of the rules with re
gard to the annual races for the Mac
donough cup will be discussed but that
the matter will remain unsettled. '
There is talk of a cruise to Santa Cruz
early next month to be made by the
schooner White Wings, the sloops Nixie
and. Meteor. The crew 'of the White
Wings mar consist of Charles Morrell,
J. M. Patrick, Carl Westerfeld. J. C.
Brlckell and "Jack" Short. Fulton Berry
will be skipper of the Nixie and W. Hogg
of the Meteor.

ward to this great race for . many ]
months past and the interest it has
awakened bids fair to make it one . of*
the contests of the year on the sward.
There are admirers galore of each dog
who are willing to- bet their money on
the chances of their favorite and there
fore the wagering on the contest looks j
like a pretty even proposition.
The stakes will consist of the best three
out of five trials. The wise ones look for
Pocatelli to wade in and take the first
course from Humboldt, as the former
dog is full of dash and vim and always
starts off with a rush. But Homboldt is
a game hound who can go the routeand
his backers think he . will manage to
outstay his brilliant opponent and bring
home the monejs in the long run. .
On the following j Sunday Freeport arid
Agile Spurt will meet the second , con
test of the series.. Following this" con
test Mr. Zlgnego and Rocked Asleep are
carded to run and then comes Richard
Anton and Panoche in the final race of
the series. These ; eight dogs are about
the speediest now in action, on the Pa-"
clfic Coast, so the trial will \u25a0"' surely be
worth going miles to see.
The card for to-morrow at Union con
sists of three stakes with a well balanced
entry list of fleet hounds. In the spe
cial stake, PanOche= bids 'fair, to rule the
favorite, while - L L C and Fiery Rock
will break' about even in the pickings
for the winner in the class reserve event.
The entries . in the reserve stake are so

YOUNG PLAYERS SHIXE
Percy Murdock Is the Only
Veteran Who Will Take
Part in the Tournament
No tennis tournaments of any im
portance will be played on the local"
courts until the annual coast champion
ship events begin. As usual these, the
biggest events of the year, will be
played^ on the Hotel Rafael courts at
San Rafael. The presence of May Sut
ton, champion of the world; her clever
sisters and the best male talent from
the southern part of the State will
make this season's events the moat in
teresting held in years.
Of course, the women's champion
ships will all go to the Suttons. There
are some fairly clever young ladies in
this part of the State, but they are
completely outclassed by the Sutton3.
It is now assured that May SuUon will
be here to defend her title, as she will
return in time. It is expected the
Misses Violet and Florence Sutton will
be in the competitions.
The bay counties will not be as well
represented as in the past and the
chances are the honors will go south
this year. Players are just as numer
ous here as ever and probably more so.
but there is a lack of class. Murdock is
the only veteran among the Vocal play
ers and aside from him the local en
thusiasts will have to pin their faith
to such men as Adams, Gardner and
Rolfe. Murdock will have to do better
than he did in the last two champion
ship events if he hopes to defeat the
visitors from the lower part of the
State. The other players / named are
uncertain quantities. Adams and Gard
ner will surely have a chance with any
of the entrants. Bell will not partici
pate and MacGavin will not be here
to defend. A new champion will be de
veloped and the event has such an open
look that all of the young cracks cher
ish fond hopes of annexing the coast
championship title.
The tournament committee for the
San Rafael tournament held an Im
promptu meeting during the week and
arranged the order of events. Chair
man R. T. Crawford. Percy Murdock
and Grant Smith were present and ar
ranged the following schedule: Men's
singles, September 2 and 4; women's
singles. September 5; men's and
women's doubles, September 6; mixed
doubles, to be announced on the courts;
finals of men's doubles, September 8;
challenge match, women's doubles, Sep
tember 9 at 10:30 a. m. : championship
match, women's singles. September 9 at
1:30: finals men's singles, September 9
aV2:3O.
The final rounds of the first handi
cap doubles tournament for the new
three-time cups will be played on the
park courts to-morrow. In the semi
finals the following teams will meet:
Harold Gabriel and A- H. Brabant (owe
3-6) vs. Harry Rolfe and Clarence
Griffin (owe 15); George Baker and
Charles (owe 15 3-6) vs. George Janes
and Herbert Long (owe 15 3-6). All
four teams are below scratch and are
evenly matched. The three remaining
matches should be close and interest
ing and fast exhibitions.
Local players are taking an unusual
Interest in the championship' tourna
ment at Portland because of the fact
that George Busch of the California
Club has worked his way almost to the
semi-finals and has not as yet lost a
set. Busch was in fine condition when
he left here and it woftld not be sur
prising if he won the championship.
AUTO.UOBU.K CLUB DESIRES
TO CONSTRUCT A BOULEVARD
Proposed Koadnnr to' Baa Past the
Â»w Gol* Club House and Ceme
teries to Baden.
Though it was generally supposed
that a meet of the Automobile Club of
California would be held at Del Monte
during the month of August, na ar
rangements have been made for a tour
nament there or anywhere else up to
the present time. The matter ha 3 been
discussed bx' the executive committee
of the Automobile Club of California,
and a decision will bÂ« reached shortly.
Del Monte and San Francisco have been
suggested as places where a race meat
may be held.
It is likely that work will soon bÂ»
begun on the boulevard, for auto
mobiles and light vehicles only, from
San Francisco into San Mateo County.
The directors of the Automobile Club
of California are trying to obtain 350
subscriptions of $100 from those whom
a good road would benefit. As the
rights of way have been secured and
the line to bo followed by tha boule
vard settled, all that 1Â« needed to
carry out the work lsÂ»tha money. The
Supervisors have $17,500 available for
the extension of Nineteenth avenue la
a southerly direction past the new
house of the San Francisco Golf and
Country Club at'lnglealde to the boun
dary line of San Mateo County. Tha
new boulevard will begin at this point
and will pass through the property of
the Spring Valley Water Company and
parallel to the track oÂ£ the Southern
Pacific Railway to School street, along
which It will run west to tha county
road, thence south to Market streat.
Colma; along Market street for a few
blocks 'and thence In a southeasterly di
rection through tha property ,of tha
Crocker Estate Company between San
Bruno avenue and the cemeteries.
The road will cost $35,000, and aftar
construction will be maintained by San
Mateo County. Suscribers may make
their checks payable to R. P. Schwerln,
president; L. P. Lowe. S. C Buckbee.

! rectors of the Automobile Club oj
I California, under whose management
I the money will be expended. If the
t necessary amount ls^not subscribed by
the middle, of next month the project
will be dropped. The proposed boule
vard will be of value not only as afford
ing a pleasant way of getting out of
San Francisco, but also as a standing
example of good road-making that will
cause the. community to â¢ insist upon
greater expenditure In the construction
and maintenance of good highways.

TENNY FINISHES
LIKE A CHAMPION
When Battle Ends Vanquished Gladia
tor Has Victor Groggy.
Neil Assumes Lead After the Fifteenth
and Wears Game Amateur Down
Frankie Neil, former bantam-weight
champion of the world, emerged the
victor over Harry Tenny at Colma last
night after the rival gladiators had
pumracled and mauled each other for
twenty-five rounds. Such fighting has
not been seen in a local arena for many
a moon and u-lien the gong sounded the
end of the last round the vanquished
man, after taking a seemingly second
lease of life, was pummeling the victor
all. over the ring. Just as Referee
Roche pointed to Neil as the winner,
the latter fell into the arms of "Spider"
Kelly from the effects of an awful right
to the jaw. But the work lie had done
in the eight previous rounds entitled
him to victory.
Though a lad just out of the ama
teur ranks, the beaten man fought like
a champion. During the last eight
rounds of the combat he was a beaten
boxer, yet his gamenoss never forsook
' him and he battled like a Trojan when
many a stout- hearted man would have
been glad of a chance to seek rest on
the carpet. Neil tried time and time
again to put his game little opponent
away, but the latter was always there
v.ith a rally at the vital moment and
stalled oit the knockout -which seemed
due at any moment.
Neil had the hardest fight of his ca
reer, and had Tenny been properly
handled the result would surely have
been different. His lack of experience
handicapped him many times when he
could have waded in and won on a
knockout. But he seemed timid just at
the time when he should have sum
moned up his aggressiveness. In the
meantime Neil would rally and set him
self for a punch. . t
Vp to the fifteenth round it was Tenny s
light. The little amateur was outbox
jng the former champion and had him
bleeding badly. He managed to wade
In and land punch after punch and had
Neil on the run several times. But the
experience of the former champion told
in the long run and after the fifteenth
round, when Tenny began to tire. Neil
seemed to get his second wind and he
was the factor from then till the hur
ricane finish.
Mil. GROWS SLOWER.
The liglit showed that Neil is not as
last a boxer as he was some time ago.
That awful left which has felled many
a tough boy was not In evidence as in
former days. He landed with it time
and time again, yet the force seemed
absent and his doughty little opponent
showed no effects from it till the bat
tle was about over. Tenny did most of
his punching with his right and he
sent in many a blow that rocked Neil.
Tenny was the biggest surprise that
lias bfctn sprung in the world of fistdom
for a lons time. He showed up as a
good tough boy with a hard punch and
an appetite for punishment that is sel
dom seen in the ring. A remarkable
thine about the lad is .his ability to
keep. on. his feet. Although his arms
\u25a0were useless la the last few rounds,
Tenny's legs were as steady aB rocks
and Neil could not stir him.
Tenny opened up the flght by mak
ing Neil look like a monkey for the
first three rounds. He began by jab
bing his left into the face, then going
into a clinch. In the breakaways he
did all the work and had Neii badly
geared. Neil did not strike his gait for
some time and the aggressivenes of his
opponent seemed to overwhelm him.
In the sixth Neil began to land with
his left to the jaw and in the rough
places he had the best of the milling.
His experience told and he rushed
Tenny hard. But the latter was always
game and during the next three rounds
It was an even proposition, with both
boys fighting hard. Tenny had' a bit
the b*>st of the milling in the eighth
and ninth, though he received a few
lefts in the stomach that did not do
him any good.
The fight came near ending in the tenth
round, when Neil began to wade in and
beat his opponent to a standstill. As
they were about to mix it In a clinch,
Frankle whipped In a terrific right to the
stomach. This blow had its effect and
Tenny staggered and looked groggy. Neil
Ftarted after him like a whirlwind and
was bent on winning the battle then, but
Tenny managed to weather the storm
and come back fighting in the final mix
up, though he seemed all but in.
TEXXV QUICKLY RALLIES.
T*>nny rallied a bit In the next round,
but It still looked as if Neil would win
quickly. The latter whipped In many of
n.ls terrific rights and they rocked Tenny.
But Harry's right was always dangerous
and he hooked over two of them on
Nell's jaw that rocked the latter. "When
the twelfth started Tenny had recovered
his second wind and was as good as
ever.
Neil began to slow up a bit after that
time and Tenny had the advantage of the
next three rounds. Nell stalled several
times and was waiting to bring In his
left, but Tenny managed to duck several
wicked swings " for the head and land
with his "right to pood advantage.
The fourteenth was Neil's and he had
Tenny groggy again. He used his left to
the head and body to advantage and
peemed to be wearing Tenny down. But
Tenny came up strong in the next period
and in the sixteenth he managed to get
a lead over Neil, rocking him several
times with his right in the mix-ups and
getting him Into a corner. As the bell
tapped Tenny landed a hard right to the
jaw that shook Nell up.
The eighteenth was a furious mix-up,
with both men fighting desperately, and
the end seemed near. Neil started in as
the aggressor and was lamming Tenny
all over the ring with his deadly left. But
the latter rallied in the last minute of
the round and came back at Neil like a
.tiger. He worked that right to the jaw
and followed Neil around the ring, bent
on beating him down. This exertion
seemed. to take a lot of his steam away,
for he never figured from that time till
tho great stand he made in the last
round.
Neil opened up the nineteenth by going
after Tenny with his left. The latter
was groggy soon after the round opened,
yet he retained his presence of mind in
good shape and ducked many bad swings.
Neil was fighting for a knockout, and
kept crowding his man all over the ring.
The twentieth was a repetition of the
former round, with Neil on the aggres
sive,- landing with his left to the head
and stomach and wearing Tenny down.
â¢ CHAMPION HAS A JOB.
The best Tenny could do In the twenty
first and twenty -second was to stall. He
vu unable to land a punch, for the
power in his arms seemed gronÂ£. He
was game, however, and would not -drop,
though Neil landed punch after, punch
that would have made the ordinary man
quit. Tenny was groggy In the twenty
third and twenty-fourth, though he oc
casionally fought back and started the
gallery cheering- once more with his
came efforts.
It did not look as if .Tenny would last
out the last two rounds, but he fooled all
the wise ones by showing stronger than
for several- previous periods. Neil had
got his second wind by this time and
was fighting hard. When he started in
in an effort to finish Tenny in the last
round the latter came back and they
mixed it viciously till . the gong tapped.
Tenny was using his right and Neil his
left. Tenny's blows were the most tell
ing and at the tap of the gong he brought
over a right that nearly put Neil away.
Had Tenny mixed in like that in the
previdus round he would have iron the
fight on a knockoutV . . - . ; -
â¢^ Referee Roche"s decision was hissed by
some, though it was perfectly just, as
Nell had done all the .work in. the last
eight rounds and Tenny would have had
to knock him out in order to win. A'
return match between the boys woulu
make a great flght. ' ')
Joe Reilly outpointed Charley Dunn in
the ten-round preliminary. Reilly took
an early lead and did most of the work,
though Dunn came strong at the finish
and came near winning on a knockout.
The fight was witnessed by a big crowd
and the accommodations were excellent,
a long line of street cars and a special
train being in waiting to take the sports
back to the city after the mill.
The following is an account of the fight
by rounds: '
/ Round One.

The pennant aspirations of Uncle Hank
glimmered away yesterday afternoon
when the Tigers waded in and routed
the Seals, 4 to 0. San Francisco might
have nosed the Champions out for honors
had they taken every game this week,
but yesterday's upset makes Mike Fisher
a three time winner.
Bobby Keefe is the lad whom the Ta
coma fans will have to shout for.. Had
there been any other pitcher In the box
yesterday the Seals might have done
something, but Keefe had the Hindoo
sign on them all and they never figured
to make a run. Whalen was there till
his support failed him at the most criti
cal stages of the fight. \
The- game was a rattler for seven In
nings and looked like it might be decided
either way. The fans were keyed up to
the highest pitch and were rooting : for
the Seals all the time. Both teams were
playing the kind of baseball that tells,
and everything looked right for a bril
liant finish.
But the eighth round spoiled it all. The
Tigers had already copped off â¢ a run in
the seventh and when" Irwin booted
Doyle's grounder as an eye-opener for
the eighth the disaster began. Doyle
got away with a steal of second and
Sheehan clouted ' one to right that let
Charles in. - Nordyke j unloaded a three
cushion shot out to deep center and, Shee
han arrived. The best Eagan had was a
long- fly, but Waldron dropped it and
Nordyke scampered over the plate, put
ting the finishing touches on the victory
oflhe Tigers. '-':\u25a0\u25a0' â¢ \u25a0
Up to the sixth the Tigers did /not get
a man to the sacks.
Then with one gone, McLaughlin rip
ped a double out past Hildebrand and
Lynch beat a scratchy one to Whalen,
Casey soused one at Mohler and the Kid
booted the: : ball? just long enough to let
McLaughlin gqt his foot .on,.the. .plate.
Casey was . retired at 'first,' but the tem
porary fumble 16t the run in. -' irJ.t i
San Francisco had men to third twice,
Irwin reaching there 'both times, but
Keefe always got better when men were
on the bases and the Seals could not hit
the ball out of the infield. The score:

HEA'SLEV PARTY STARTS
AGAIA TO BREAK RECORD
Antomobillstn' Hope* of Reducing Time
to Lorn AnsrlcM Undaunted by Ac
cident of Tnursday Msht.
Georjfe A. Hensley, accompanied by
H. I>. Ryus of Los Angeles and A. H.
Piepenburg and Gus Siegfried of this
city, made a second start in their
White touring cttr last night to try to
break the automobile record of 24 hour^
and 50 minutes to Los Angeles. Thw
get-away was made as quietly as pos
sible, so that there would be little
chance of some mishap repeating the
trick of Thursday night, when a bolt
was slipped into the machinery of the
car and the attempt to break the record
broasfbt to a sudden stop. Only a small
crowd witnessed the start at the cor
ner of Third and Market streets, for the
reason that the event was unheralded
save by the faint tooting- of the norn;
but many of those who were gathered
there shook huads with the party and
wished them jjood speed i*nd fair roads.
Knowledge of a further attempt to
stop the automobile ou Thursday night
came to light yesterday. Just a few
miles below San Leandro some one had
felled a tree and the mass of trunk and
limbs 'was lying across the road. For
tunately the party received a warning
along- the way, and when they ap
proached the tree they were able to
stop in timo to save being- dashed to
death. A close watch will bo kept to
night for a repetition of the crime.

ley's automobile party, which left San
Francisco for Los Angeles at 10:15 last

Idleness a Cause for Divorce.
: In the shocking cases of perfidy and
of unfaithfulness to the marriage tow
among our wealthier classes, tho root
of the matter lies, as in so many other
sorts of sin. in idleness. The absence of
strenuous, compulsory occupation ia la
itself a temptation t& crime. The Idle
man or woman whose sole interest la
life is .the pursuit of pleasure Inevitably
becomes sated with its different forms.
All â¢of the ingenuity which can be ex
pended upon inventions of 'new sorts of
food, new ways of serving, new enter
tainments, really avails little. After all
is said and done a banquet is only a
banquet, a cotillon is only a cotillon, and
even- operas and . theaters after, a few
years begin to seem strangely and dully
alike. A new emotion, a new sensationâ
this becomes the only fresh and desira
ble thing on earth.â Leslie's Weekly.
The English Sprlnff Cleaning.
There 13 not a more decisive ukase In
domestic affairs than , that which for-;
bids the reversion to coal flres after
spring cleaning. Is done. The incon
venience which the Inmates of a house
suffer Is tolerated because the use of
coal. fires would undo the work of the
spring cleaning process. \u25a0:â¢ â¢ â¢ "We
see here a powerful argument In favor
of the abolition of a coal flre altogether
and the adoption "of a gas flre or elec
tric; heater in. its place. So long as the
English " climate exhibits fickleness of
thej disagreeable kind we have recently
experienced. . ' the ' present system :ot
spring cleaning Is based on a very daa
arerous postulate. â London Lancet.

The patt week was the hottest of the season
and no rs!n of any consequence occurred in any
part of the State. Fortunately, the wind was
Ctr.erally liyht and the wheat crop suffered
but little damage. In the Grande Ronde Val
ley and in some of the Columbia River coun
. ties east of the Cascade Mountains late sown
earing wheat was damaged by the hot weather

of the crop, however, is sare, and both spring
and fall wheat are now being cut ac rapidly
fis poss-ble. Thrashing will tx-gln in the Wil
lamett* Valley this week. All indications

Sevr York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. July 28. â The creeping up
ward movement cf prices which has been in
progress several days flared up Into a flash
of speculative ypirit to-day and the stock mar
ket wan brcader and more animated than for
a considerable time. The Bales effected In the
two hours to noon equaled the maximum for
a whole day recently. Thereafter there was a
decided falling off in activity and some hesita
tion in pursuing the holdings acquired in the
early part of the day. The upward movement
was net explained by aty immediate event,

tion of confidence which has been gathering

the broadening of the demand for investment

the early movement among the mott con

rather weak from the start. Initial quotations
on September being a shade higher to l&o
lower at S6*ic to 87c, One factor ' that con
tributed a bearish sentiment was an Increase
In local receipts. Liberal shipments from Ar
gentine gave additional emphasis to the, weak
undertone. - Weather In the Northwest was
wet in Minnesota, but clear generally through
out the Dakotas. Under general selling Sep
tember eased off to BÂ«MsC. Sentiment then
became bullish for a time on a report by a
Minneapolis crop expert regarding damage to
spring wheat by black rust.' This authority
summed up the situation by stating that
the crop in the rust affected district is already
reduced one-half, both in quality and yield.
Reports from other . sources, however, gave a
more optimistic outlook for the _ new crop.
The market soon experienced a sharp break,
and for the remainder of the session extreme
weakness prevailed. The market closed at
the lowest point of the day, with September
off %Â©l%c at 85% c. -.'â¢

The Butter market Is again In cne of its
periodical spasms, when every dealer has his
own price and is urgent to have his quota
tions accepted as the true . reflection of the
market. The result is confusion.' Cards were
sent out yesterday offering creamery at 22 40
230 per lb in lots to suit. Other houses quoted
24c : and several higher still. Under these
chaotic conditions accurate quotations are
difficult, but those below are a fair average
tor the day. The market is heavily supplied
and stocks are unevenly distributed, some
houses being oversupplled and others carrying
light stocks.
Eggs stand about the same. Like Butter,
quotations - are more or less Irregular. ' some
houses quoting a firm market with shipping
orders and others an easy market with not
much demand. Receipts are falling off a little
again. Owing to the summer country demand
for Eggs there axe few store Eggs arriving
at present.
' Cheese continues in large supply and un
changed.
Receipts were 77.600 lbs Butter. 1056 cases

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Receipts of fruit . were somewhat late again
yesterday.^ much : to the Inconvenience of the
trade during the early morning hours, when
the demand for . fresh stock is most urgent.
The market was generally steady,, there being
some advance buying for shipping account, and
the canners were still taking liberal quantities,
of bulk fruit." Prices of Apricots, both packed
and loose, continued \u25a0to advance and the can
ners were unable to procure any, all of the
available supplies being well ! cared for by
the regular local and shipping trade. The
season for' this fruit Is rapidly drawing to a
close and the crop in Alameda County Is about
exhausted. Pears ruled firm and the best
offerings of Plums and Prunes were steady,
while Peaches were lower under more liberal
supplies and the canners \u25a0 reduced their bid for
Freestones " in bulk. 'Nectarines were offer
ing freely, but attracted little attention, and
Grapes were easier under heavy arrivals, the
receipts including | a straight carload of the
Thompson Seedless variety from Dinuba Mel
ons were in good request, but prices of Nut
meg Melons and river Cantaloupes ranged
lower, supplies being more than sufficient for
market \u25a0 needs. ! There was no Improvement In
I Apples and only well-packed lots of Graven
; steins sold over $1 per box. Quinces appeared
'from Sonoma .County and \u25a0 sold at $1 25 per
, box. The quotations for Figs are omitted,
there being none received. Huckleberries
were in increased supply and much lower,
while the other .Berries stood about as pre
viously quoted. Citrus goods were moderately
active and eteady at the old quotations.

HEALTH BOARD
MAY BE SUED
Dealers \u25a0 Whose' Goods Were
Condemned Are Likely to
; Try to Recover Damages
The Health Hoard is likely to be in
volved in serious difficulties as the re
sult of City Attorney Long's opinion
that it has no power to condemn or de
stroy foods or merchandise which it
deems to be adulterated. A.'number of
dealers, it is said, are up in arms, and
it is likely that suits will he filed by
aggrieved parties whose {joods were
condemned and destroyed by the Health
Board.
The practice of the Health- Board in
the past han been to destroy all . food
stuffs found to contain adulterants
after chemical examination. This was
done in the caso of red wines which
were recently found to contain salicylic
acid, benzole acid and coal ta,r dyes.
Several dealers consented to having
their wines dumped Into the sewera,
but the Health Board claims to be re
lieved from liability because their con
sent was first obtained. . A large gro
cery firm refused to permit some thou
sands of gallons of red wines found ta
be .sophisticated, saying that it had taken
legal advice in the premises. The Health
Hoard did not press the destruction of
the wines, and the City Attorney's opin
ion Dears out the staud taken by the
firm.. â¢ ' ; ' '
1^ has been the custom for many years
for the health olficials to pour coal oil
on all meats and fish .found 'diseased
or. lmpure, but the City Attorney's opin
ion will prevent this touroe In future.
Tons upon tons of food for human con
sumption have been . destroyed in past
years in this way, including many im
mature calves ttnd diseased fowl- arvi
cattle. When\James Dockery was Milk
Inspector thousands of gallons of milk
found not up to standard were dumped
in the roadway to run down the sew
ers. If theÂ« City Attorney's opinion is
sound the health '\u25a0 otficials have been
acting illecajly In such matters.. Under
his opinion the only course to " pursue
is to â¢ prosecute criminally 'any, offend
ers who adulterate their goods or whose
milk, is in;t>ure.
Health Olficer Ragan says that -the
inspectors of the present board "never
dumped the milk found deficient, but
simply prosecuted tht- offenders.- ft He
says that the i effect of Long's opinion
will be to tie the hands of the board,
as the prosecution of the guilty^ parties
is hardly of sufficient severity to pre
vent their illicit practices.- 'â¢ The fact
that tho board cannot condemn impure
lood and order it removed from tho
shrives of the - dealers will militate
against the effective"- workiing of tho
crusade for pure food.

Babes Ogle Him and Gry "Papa/
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Two buxom, ladies of middle age stood
before Police Judge Cabanisa and upon
the rljrht arm of each of them sat a
healthy-looking babe, j
"I iss der mudder." said one of the
matrons, "und dey vass twins, und
Theodore . Wlnbergr vass der f adder."
"Papa!" sang the infants^ ogling his
Honor. ' \u25a0 ~ .
"Theodore Winberg," the mater re
sumed, "promiesed , he vud pay fer der
subbort of dese kids, boot he hass nefer
did id." ' â¢ ' S \u25a0:\u25a0\u25a0} '
"And you are Mrs. Winberg, I - pre
sume?" tho Judge â¢ventured.- â¢ '
"Nein," was the reply; * "Theodore
promissed he vud merry me, -boot he
hass nefer did id." â¢ - -â¢'â¢ \u25a0
"Papa!" gurgled the youngsters.
Then the story came out. Mr.' Winberg,
a seaman, entered a longshore" boarding
house and ' became enamored' "of the
spinster who eventually presented â¢ him
with the twins. More than a . year has
elapsed since paternity descended upon
Theodore, and he began to shirk- its re
sponsibilities. The mother utilized all
available means to compel him to lead
her to the hymeneal altar, but her age
deprived her of the legal redress .that a
woman of fewer "years "might have ob
tained. Then she haled him ; Into 'court
to show cause why he should not at least
pay for the maintenance of his' offspring,
and he pledged himself to contribute a
percentage of his earnings to defray the
cost of their proper, upbringing, but again
he renigged. Hence the mother's" appeal
to his Honor Cabanlss. â¢..â¢\u25a0â¢:
"Is he in the city?" inquired the, bench.
"He iss," simultaneously replied both
women. ' \u0084' . . .
"Papa!" lisped the infants. . "\u25a0\u25a0>. _' -
An attorney, however, volunteered the
information that Mr. "Winberg. is in
Alaskan waters and may never return- to
San Francisco. .
,"If you prove that .he is within , the
Jurisdiction 'of this court I will gladly
aid you in fetching him , here," eald the
Judge- to the ladies, v - .-.
"Papa!" chirruped \u25a0 the little ones, and
as they were borne corridorward they
waved chubby hands at the bench. â¢
Jacob Lucas and' Albert I Davis, % private
infantrymen from ; : the Presidio,.; -I were
aweary of partaking of army rations
when they dropped into a restaurant? at
Fifth and Jessie streets and" consumed
two rib steaks,, two plates of ham and
eggs, six cups of coffee and two . cigars.
When their smoke \ was. finished x they at
tempted to evade paying for the viands
by sneaking past the cashiers- desk, but
they were perceived by the 'restaura
teur who blew a whistle 'as he pursued
them, and Patrolman P. C.Blick quick
ly had them under arrest. They did not
supinely yield to capture, however, for
while Private' Lucas sat upon \u25a0 the side

It was not so much the auality of the
ciprnr smoked by Private Thomas Callk
han. United States Infantry, as his act
of. smoking - that enraged the conductor
of -a Union-street car. That is not equiv
alentto saying that the weed puffed by
Private Callahan was of Cuban "oriarln
or .that it was tobacco'at all. Indeed
sou^e of his follow passengers who in
voluntarily : Inhaled the fumes emitted
by him were ready to oiler odds that
the thing projecting from his mouth
corner was not tobacco; but their esti
mate of what it consisted was ao wide;
ly divided. as to leave the mystery as
far as' ever from solution. Private Cal
lahan himself, when questioned on the
subject, frankly admitted that he did
not know, what he was smoking. It
might, have been a dried onion or a su
perannuated pickled cucumber, or a piece
of retired r sTiip', rope or anything else
thnt his companions in the car pro
nounced- it â¢â¢'.' All he did! Know was that
he paid 5 cents for it in a Piclflc-street
dance hall.- and that this box: from
which he lifted it bore' the picture of a
dark-complexioned ladj- in scant ap
parel holding aloft a banner.'on- which
was inscribed "Pride of â " "hie coulil
not remember what . , I !: :
When/* t.he conductor .informed " Pri
vate" Callahan that â¢ smoking was not
allowed, -in the t box, section of -. any
Union-street -car Private \Callahan re-
sponded by 'blowing a- cloud; so-volumi

ever,-valiantly, stood his ground and.
with, nostrils , pressed .between 4 , thumb

to compel; Mary -.Feehari : "to 'accept
127,000 for: her* lot on Fell street, near

proceedings, was -considered. '
Colonel T: F. : Barry said Mrs. Feehan
was 'riot being treated fairly in , the
matter, .as .the /property was /.worth
$28,000. Barry, in order to avoid a law-"
suit, offered to sell the lot for $27,750,
an amount , which Official Appraiser
Mooser. had fixed In his appraisement
report. â¢
Assistant . City â¢ Attorney John ;P.
Coghlan insisted that. s27,ooo was a fair
figure in conformity with the prices
paid for other subdivisions in the block.
City.; Attorney Long said he did ,not
propose .to; have the city, pay, more for
property than it. is worfh and he -was
satisfied that Coghlan's price of $27,000
was correct and he would stand by.it
The^ committee then decided to refer
the matter to Coghlan, who is to give
Barry' another hearing on his claim that
the property is worth $27,750.
The committee referred to Supervisor
d # Ancona and School Director Boyle the
offerrof James'lrvlne-to sell for- school
purposes a lot of land on Castro street,
between Fourteenth and Henry,:* for
$30,000, and y they were instructed to

The committee accepted the offer of
George Fogel to sell for $15,125 a lot

The committee, agreed to pay. $27,000
to. Sidney M. Starr for. a lot adjoining
