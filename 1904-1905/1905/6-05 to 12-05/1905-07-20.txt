NEW TORK. July IS.â While thÂ© record
of deaths and prostrations greatly ex
ceeded that of yesterday, there was a dis
tinct diminution to-day in thÂ© ' tempera
ture prevailing throughout r the 4 eastern
section of the country. Although ' the
midday heat .was everywhere terrific. It
was broken by scattered thunderstorms,
many of a very violent 'character, and to
ward evening the temperature fell . rapid
ly. With this welcome relief came the an
nouncement from the Weather Bureau to
night that the abatement in the heated
term had been general and that moderate
temperatures probably would prevail for
several days in the Middle Atlantic and
New England States.
In New York the highest temperature
recorded was 85, one degree lower than
that of yesterday, when the highest rec
ord of the season was reached.
Philadelphia reported a slightly higher
maximum range, but in other cities the
highest poini of . yesterday was not
touched, while everywhere a sharp fall
was notiotd in the afternoon.
As usual, the official maximum tempera
tures were everywhere exceeded by those
prevailing In the crowded districts, where
the actual temperature frequently ex
ceeded 100 degrees.
The cumulative effect of the continued
torridity of these days was painfully evi
dent In the enormous increase I oosf s the
number of deaths in New York.
While the death roll of yesterday
as only , 20, that of to-day reached
. the appalling; total of 75, being nearly
/'one-half of thoae p'rost rated. Thin
"vra* almost entirely dne to the collapse
of youusr children and aged â¢ people,
whose exhausted , vitality was unequal
to the strain of further safferinff.
After a night of sweltering heat
epent by thousands *in the streets, \u25a0in
the public parks, on .piers along the
river front and In every i, vacant = place
that promised a breath of air. : the con
ditions that confronted' the people of
New York this mornln|r-werÂ« terrify
ing. The sun rose in a cloudless sky,
and hour after hour ,tthÂ«.- heat; grrew
more and more Intense. ' Every ambu
laree was kept busy 'and* by s noon the
hospitals were crowded with . sufferers.
At Z o'clock in the fafterno^nV. 1 came
the long prayed for, relief,. wnenVa ter
"?iflc thunderstorm and^ a deluge of rain
burst over Brooklyn v and - the lower
part of Manhattan and sections of New
Jersey, In Brooklyn^ two T men v; were
etruck by llg-htnlng- and seriously, hurt,
and In Jersey City one; man. was killed.
While the storm lasted only- a* few, min
utes end left the . nppert part ; of the
city untouched, the relief: was almost
instantaneous, and from j then onV the
_ mercury fell steadily, and a cool] breeze
springing up after sundown gave 'Jias
surance of a comfortable night. ; , : "
Even the seashore ;resorts;inrthe^vicin
ity of New York did not escape the heat,'
and many prostrations "occurred*" among
the thousands that! flocked^f^to Coney,
Island and the other beaches on the \ Long
Island shore. '^9HBKBBBBiBSinKBHDsI
Leonard Sanders, a colored man- from
New Haven, went mad in the public park
in East One Hundred and; Thirtieth
etreet and leaped into the river from the
Harlem bridge. He was rescued by boat
men after a fierce struggle; in which: he
upset the boat and nearly drowned his
rescuers. ' *
Several of the deaths reported were
those of persons who, while asleep, I',1 ', had
fallen from fire escapes, where they^were
endeavoring to escape the stifling atmos^
phere of crowded tenements. "
.With 150 bodies in the cold storage room
et the:. City Morgue.- the ; refrigerating
system was found to be out of order to
day, and it was necessary to resort to the
use of tons of ice; in which' the l: bodies
were : packed. Fifty bodies werÂ« hurried
to the potter** field.

BREWER DISCUSSES GRAFT.
Supreme Conrt Justice Addresses Life
Insurance Affenta at Milwaukee.
MILWAUKEE, July 19.â Justice Da
vid Brewer, of the United States Su
premo Court, delivered a short address
before. a large assemblage of life in
surance agents in the Masonic building
in this city to-night. He devoted mpst,
of his talk to modern graft. and
praised President. Roosevelt, in hls,ef-.
forts to make public' affairs ; pure stiid
honest. Said' he: .' ... . .;'
This has been a year which may be charac
terised as one of gi cat -Insurance upheaval.
The result hps been prejudicial to the Interest
of a certain company and also to .the Interests
end business of others.. I believe- this win
result in srrc-at benefit to insurance through
out the world. The moment private pecuniary
{.-sin ig sought through the advantage of a
trust come one is guilty of grafting. '
There was never a truer eaylng that than of
G rover Claveland that a public i office. . is ,a
public trust. There is to-day co much graft-
Ing: going on among . public officials as ito
startle us. I am not dpeaking now about 'the
coarser kind of grafting such- as buying
votes, paying money. Â«tc.. which we all con
demn. I have reference to the more insidious
ways that the one holding "public office is not
carrying on the duties of that offlcte with ah
eye single to his trust, in . prostituting in one'
way or another that office for his own gain
or the gain of his ends.
Take the President of the United States.
Along in the winter Santo Domingo put Itself
on a financial footing. Suppose the President had
acted secretly and advised his friends to buy
up Eanto Domingo bonds. Wouldn't that
shock the people of the country? Yet the Gov
ernment would ' lose nothing and some would be
private gainere. Suppose the "United States
Buprerr.e Court Justices would give out in
formation In advance of certain decisions. -
Would not you revolt at such .a transaction?
It would bÂ« unworthy â this would be grafting.
It requires not merely action of officials of
the Government, but action of every one that
the administration of -public affairs ,be kÂ«pt
pure and honeet. '.'-.. \u25a0 \ \u25a0
IS HUNTING SHAKES

Honolulu Chinese Mill Owner
Sends Ship Mokihana on
Novel Expedition.
Epeclal Dispatch to Tb* CaU.
HONOLULU, July 19.â Somewhere out
on the broad Pacific the crew of the good
shfp Mokihana is waging warfare against
the shark tribe. It is two weeks since
she sailed away on her mysterious mis
sion, for neither her skipper nor any of
her crew of ten natives would tell whith
er they were bound or why they were
bound there.
. One reason why none of them would
tell .wJiere they â¢ were . going was excel
lent. They did no know. Their course
was all to make and the sharks were
to make it. The Mokihana may be back
in two ' weeks or she may be absent as
many months, for she is well provisioned
and her voyage will end only when she
has killed sharks enough or when sup
plies falf.
C. K. Al.* the well-known Chinese-
American owner, of the City Mill. Is the
backer of the expedition, and if this ven
ture turns out well It- is quite probable
that Honolulu will see established an
other enterprise. ...

recoided a jump of 20 per cent, making a
total rise of S3 per cent since June 30.
The'Boerse Is. much puzzled over the
meaning of this speculation, which re
calls many features of the great struggle
over the Hibernia coal mines -last sum
mer between the banks and the Prussian
treasury department to secure control of
the mines. Various rumors are in clrett- 1

the creation of the Darmstadter # Bank,
which reorganized it three years ago
from two bankrupt^ companies, the.Dlf

to one version another bank Is trying to
secure control,' but another and appar
ently the more correct explanation Is that
the Deutsche Luxembergische company
is about to enter into a fusion with sev
eral other concerns: " â¢ \u25a0 V " '
The" latter version gains color through
the fact that- three of the greatest coal

Eia is anxluus {or peace.
The Temps adds that those impres
sions afforded De Witte an opportunity
to clear up the position, showing that,
while all was favorable to peace, he waa
conscious of the danger of a prolonged
war if Japan insisted upon onerous
conditions.
KOREA TO SEND TWO E.WOTS.
Imclxts Upon Representation In the
Peace Conference.
SEOUL, Korea, July 19.â Against the
advice of members of the foreign lega
tions here, Korea has decided to send
two representatives to Washington to
attempt to secure a hearing before the
peace plenipotentiaries. Both of the
men chosen were formerly students In
America. They are young, without
public standing and bear no credentials.
The Emperor's privy purse supplies
them with 10,000 yen to "Inaugurate a
newspaper campaign to interest Ameri
cans in Korea's plight." '
* Japanese Minister Hayashi has pro
tested and suggested a personal consul
lation before the departure of the Ko
reans, which, it is asserted, they have
tried to avoid. The scheme is consid
ered by the Japanese here as a useless
expense and not as a serious attempt
to interest the world.

Third Manchurian army to-day
adopted a most optimistic tone. He de
clared that the Japanese were unable
to advance, both on account> of \u25a0 the

DEPARTURE OF DE TVTTTE.
Remarkable ' Demonstration In Honor
of the Russian Peace Envoy.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 19.â M. de
Witte's departure for Paris to-day,
while a very democratic affair, was the
occasion of a remarkable demonstra
tion In his honor. The compartment
occupied by Russia's chief plenipoten
tiary was filled with flowers and the
platform of the station was crowded
with friends, who bade him good-by
and good luck In the great mission be
fore him. The whole affair was a tes
timonial of the strength of De Witte's
personal following:. Among those pres
ent were all the prominent officials
who had seen service under the former
Minister of Finance. The secretary of
the Chinese legation and the Korean
Minister were both In attendance.
Mme. de Witte will not accompany
her husband.
DOUBTS THE CZAR'S SINCERITY.
Japan Learns That Russia Is About to
Mobilize Four Army Corps.
TOKIO, July 19. â It is believed that
Emperor Nicholas recently sent an en
couraging message to General Line
vitch, promising him provisions and
other necessaries for attaining an ul
timate victory. It is" also reported that
the Russian Emperor recently ordered
the mobilization of four army corps.
This fact, taken in connection with
the limitation of M. de Witte's power
as chief peace plenipotentiary, is
deemed to be a siern that Russia is not
sincere in her expressed desire for the
conclusion of peace.
Railroad Forced to Reduce Rates.
TOKIO, July 19. â The Seoul and Fu
ean Railway Company, although heavily
subsidized to encourage Japanese enter
prise in Korea, trebled the freight rates
between Seoul and Chemulpo, and en
deavored to recoup on the busiest
branch road the losses sustained on. the
main line. Threats made by the Cham
bers of Commerce to complain to Toklo
that this action was restraining trade
have forced^ the company to make an
apologetic reduction, in rates, to go Into
effect on Monday next.
Russians May Be Captured.
TOKIO, July 19.â 1t is believed that
the topographical nature of. the dis
trict beyond Mauka, on the Island of
Saghalien, where the .Russians are
making a stand after their defeat at
Darllne. forbids their retreat farther
north. Shortness of ammunition may
soon compel them to surrender.

AMERICANS WIN
INSTRAIGHT SETS
LONDON. July 19.â The only interest in
the third day's play in the Dwight F.
Davis, international tennis cup competi
tion was with regard to the possibility
of the Americans gaining the. maximum
points aerainst the Australasians, which
they did, both William J A. Lamed and
Beals^C. -Wright- winning their matches.
Lamed beat Norman E. Brookes, the
Australasian champion, .three sets to
love, and Wright accounted for M. F.
Wilding by two sets to love. -The Aus
tralasian players , were not anxious to
play, as the Americans had already won
three points out, of five, proving their
right to meet the holders of the cuprp but
the fules made it necessary for the teams
to play out the three days' programme.
Wright and Wilding arranged to playhhe
best two 'out of three sets instead of the
best three out of five, and Wright won.
The first 'B*>t of ; the match between
Lamed and Brookes was one of mere
endurance ratWcr than the display of
brilliant tennis. After that the game was
without feature, except .- the ~ regularity
with which each won his service. The
American won. * : " - >
The second set fell easily to Lamed,
Brookes showing signs of fatigue. Lamed
took matters easily in the third set and
won?, without "effort. r '-' : ' . >
The American team has 'improved won

The Americans have not selected the
team for the challenge j round which will

Alleged Discovery of Con

One of the Subjects Dis
cussed by the 'Delegates
LONDON, July 20. â The Moscow cor
renpondent of the Times says that one
of the topics of conversation during the
proceedings of the Zemstvo | Congress
wai the alleged discovery of a military
plot j airalnst Emperor Nicholas. \u25a0 .~. ~ Â«
MOSCOW, July 29.â The Zematvc
Congress opened at noon to-day at the
residence of Frince Dolgorukoff. - The
congress was attended by 225 delegates.
Count Heyden, leader of the deputation
representing the committee recently re
ceived by the Emperor, presided.
M. Golovine, president of the organiz
ing: committee, had barely started a
statement dealing with the obstacles
placed In the way of the congress, an
nouncing that Governor General Koz
loff had promised that there would be
no recourse to extreme measures, when
the Chief of Police, with numerous com
missaries and officials, * entered the
room. 'The' Chief announced that the
Prefect had prohibited the meeting of
the congress and ordered the seizure
of the documents. Count Heyden pro
tested against the proceedings, but the
Chief of Police began taking the names
of the delegates. Then the cry was
raised. "Write down- the whofe of
Russia." Many persons present who
were not deK'aUs to tho congress re
quested that their names be nlso taken.
The police departed iv order to draw
up summonses.
The scheme, of a national . assembly
on the basis outlined oy the committee
presided over by M. Boultgan, Minister
of the Interior, was minutely and crit
ically discuss-d and denounced as
totally inadequate to removo" Russia's
internal grievances, because, includ
ing- a. property qualification and an elec
toral system by classes, it prevented the
assembly from truly interpreting the
will of the injvtion.iWhileitho, exclusion
of numerous catt-yories of citizens from
the franchise, was a contradiction ol
the principles of equity and reasonable
state policy.;
At the same time lt : was recognized
that the proposed assembJy would com
prise a considerable portion of the so
fcial forces of the empire and serve as
the center of a social movement Which
would tend, to secure political liberty
and regular national representation.
Therefore it was considered desirable
that, in the event of carrying* out of
the Boullgan or a simlMr- project. th*j
delegates of the zemstyos and munici
palities* should participate In the as
sembly to the greatest possible extent,
with the object' ot forming a compact
group and to obtain a guarantee of In
dividual Rnd public liberties.
Numerous resolutions embodying th<s
foregoing criticisms ' were adopted
unanimously^ h.s were also resolutions
complaining of excessive adminis
trative and police Â«:ontrol of elections
and insisting that publicity be given to
the proceedings of the proposed-assem
bly, which should be in direct relations
\u25a0with the F.mperor, without interference
from the Council of the Empire.
MUTINIES ABOA-TV HIS SHIPS.
Rojestvenftky's ' Report Explains Anni-
hilation of Russian Fleet.
- PARIS. July 19.â According to the St.
Petersburg correspondent of La Llbeirte,
Admiral Rojestvensky, in his reoort of
the battle of the Sea of Japan, which re
sulted in the practical annihilation of his
fleet, says that his ships were bad. They
had been not only hastily, but dishonest
ly, built. The thickness of their armor
did \u25a0 not ; agree with official figures in the
case of any of the vessels. Moreover, it
was of inferior" quality.
The shells. were bad; two-thirds of them
did, not explode.
None; of the ships were able to carry
the necessary. coal. None of them at
tained average speed.- The boilers were
poor and needed repairs. \u25a0./
Two-thirds of the crews, including tnose
of - Vice-Admiral Neboga toff's \u25a0 squadron,
were incapable. The gunners were igno
rant of the elementary laws of firing.-
: A . mutiny occurred while that fleet was
at Madagascar -- and , fourteen men were
put to death. Â«
. Admiral RojestvenskV bad to train
grnns - on' two of bin ovrn ships, the Ad
miral Senlavlii and the Admiral Aprnx
ine, coant defense vessels, 'to restore
order. } The crews hnd derided secretly
to surrender to .the enemy. This was
discovered too late. ;
There 2 was another mutiny on Vice-
Admiral' NebbgatofTs squadron near For
mosa. 1 , and Admiral Rojestvensky. had dif
ficulty; in preventing the mutineer^ \u25a0 from
seizing the greater part of the squadron.
Admiral Rojestvensky : saw frqm the
outset, of . the > battle that the; Admiral
Seniavin and ; the Admiral Apraxins were
not .fighting 'and were ignorant of orders.
They â¢ fired only when he} sent torpedo
boats .to, them and threatened to sink
them unless they , obeyed. " ,\u25a0\u25a0 . V :
If Admiral â¢ Rojestvensky had "not been
wounded at the beginning of , the battle,
the f result " might .have been different.
Almost simultaneously, with *h!s' removal
to a torpedo boat, "Admiral Enqulst disap
peared, f Admiral :, Foelkersam .was ; killed
â¢and Admiral | Nebogatoff, who was unpop
ular, with Lthe sailors, was obliged to take

quarter pole was reached had a slight
lead. As Sweet Marie passed the quar
ter pole she broke and Tiverton took
the pole. At the half-mile post Tiver
ton led by several lengths. Sweet*
Marie again broke at the three-quarters
pole and -Tiverton passed under the
wire well in hand and two lengths in
the lead. His time for the mile was
2:10%. lowering the track record for
trotters in a race one second.
Tiverton led at the quarter In the
second heat and increased it to three

looked for a close finish, but at the
eighty- yard pole the mare broke and
lost her chance to win. Tiverton camo
under the wire in a fine stride several
lengths in the lead. His time was

could be shaken down as thick as hail.

LOS ANGELES, July 19.â 1n a special
article'on the Colorado River and the in
undation r of Salton Sink by the diverted
waters of 'that" stream, the Express says:
"It may require the expenditure of from
$1,000.000 't0 $2,000",000 and the co-operation
of two Governments to prevent the water
of the Colorado from making a great
'inland sea In the Colorado" desert Unless
the' water now pouring Into the desert, is
brought under control. It must rise^lnch
by iricH until every one of the prosperous
colonieson the desert are submerged, to
gether with twenty-five miles of the
Southern Pacific track. __ There Is no
r d6iib*t the "water "will be brought Under
contrdl'long before It inundates. the agri
cultural land, but It Is not 'Improbable
that a considerable stretch of. the rail
road will have to be removed to higher
ground and the engineers believe that it
is an even' chance that the waters will
not be controlled until Congress meets
and this Government arranges with Mex
ico for the dredging of the Colorado
River. ' \u25a0 :
"It is' not improbable that the entire
Colorado River will be discharging Into
the' Salton Sink .within a few" weeks.
This does riot necessarly Imply great loss,
except to the Southern Pacific Railroad,
which will be obliged to expend a large
sum of money under tha most favorable
conditions^ to save Its property. So far
as the irrigated territory is concerned It
lies high above the lower depths of the
Salton Sink, and the steady flow of the
river Into the sink would not In all prob
ability inundate any farm 'inside of three
years, while it is estimated that It would
take five years to fill the basin lying be
low sea level." â¢ ' - ' '

Weekly Gall Sl.oflier YearCOLLINS' CASE
IS CONTINUED
Fugitive Lawyer Given Time
to Examine Depositions
Sent From San Francisco
HE GETS AN EXTRA DAY
Will Appear Again To-Day
Before Judge Lampman
of the Court in Victoria
VICTORIA. B. C, July IS.â Tbe extra
dition proceedings against George D. Col
lins, charged with committing perjury In
San Francisco, were continued until to
morrow morning to allow Collins and his
counsel, H. D. Helmcken, to examine the
depositions brought from San Francisco
by Detective Thomas Gibson. Frank
Hlgglns, appearing on behalf of the San
Francisco police, asked leave to amend
the information against Collins by strik
ing out the words specifying the action
In which the alleged perjury was commit
ted. Collins' counsel objected and ask
ed the court to reserve the amendment,
which was done. Collins' counsel then
asked that the case be adjourned until
to-morrow. The prosecution asked that
the case be adjourned until Monday, but
this was objected to and Judge Lamp
man remanded Collins until to-morrow
morning.
WITNESSES TO GO JfORTH.
Will Leave San Francisco for Victoria
on Friday.
District Attorney Byington awaited
anxiously yesterday morning for news
of the preliminary hearing of George
D. Collins at Victoria. It was two
o'clock when the telegram came from
Chief of Police J. M. Langley announ
cing that all was well and stating that
although the trial was only continued
until to-day, he felt sure that the Ca
nadian authorities would wait the com
ing of the California witnesses. A
few minutes later word came from De
tective Thomas Gibson asking that the
clerk's book of marriage licenses be
sent along with the witnesses.
The two witnesses In the perjury
case. Attorney Thomas E. Curran and
Justice of the Peace A. J. Henry, will
leave for the north on Friday of this
week. This will allow them time !to
get there before the beginning of pro
ceedings on Monday. "With them will
go R. A. "Whiting, acting for the Dis
trict Attorney. They will take the
original documents In the case and the
marriage license book. Byington will
determine to-morrow whether another
witness will be required and should an
other be needed, William Newman,
brother of Collins* first wife, will be
chosen.
The District Attorney this morning
summoned Mrs. Anna J. "Ward, who
has accused Collins of failing to make
an accounting to her in a case which he
was handling for her, and Questioned
her about an arrangement with Col
lins In regard to settling her claim out
of court. Collins settled the case and
took the money, but so far he has not
made any accounting, according to Mrs.
Ward. '; â¢ ; Y. .:
Mrs. "Ward is very loth to 'bring a
charge of embezzlement against a
fugitive lawyer and will not do so un
less tfee District Attorney asks her to
sign ~ the complaint. She is not sure
that the lawyer really meant to go
away with her money and she believes
that he may return it to her, although
she admits that he took it without her
authority. Byington said yesterday af
ternoon that the case was not nearly
as strong as the one of perjury now in
the courts and that he would make no
use of It unless the present attempt at
extradition failed.

Sullivan made the weight handily,

small wagers have been made -with

The Steam- Beer Sisters broke loose
again. The aggregation is made up of
Mary Glbbour, May Murphy and Malme
Fitzpatrick. All of them are over fifty.
They started down offt Howard street.
Mary rushed the first can, May hot-foot
ed after the second and Malme chased
the. third duck. They kept it up till
the growler wore out. Then they start
ed to do the line.
Arm and arm they promenaded Howard
street, began to warble "Three Lit
tle Maids From School." May assisted
and Malme came in . with the contralto.
Policeman Brown and Nobman heard
the sound of music In the distance.
"It's them," said Brown. "It's the
Steam Beer Sisters."
The trio came up the pike like an ava
lanche. They were still warbling their
little ditty, "Three little maids from
school are we."
"Cut it out, kids. Take it to some
other beat," pleaded Policeman Brown.
But the three little maida were primed
full of song.' Brown grabbed Mary and
Nobman took May and Maime.
When the municiual coach drew up" at
the Hall of Justice, they were still as
serting that they were three little maids
from school. They sang it all night.
When Judsre Fritz saw the trio In the
cage, he said, "Well, -this certainly does
look homelike. My old friends the Steam
Beer Kids. Who started it this time?"
"It was Mary," said ' May. !
"Sure It was, your honor," . declared
Mame.
Mary was silent. She was too Indig

"Ten days for Mary for getting the
bunch started," decided the Judge. Twen

When he entered a Pacific-street
dance hall he had a Colts 45 tucked in

A thief, who has the Police \u25a0, Department
at wits', end, has been operating; for some
time in the vicinity ; of Bush and Jones
streets among; apartment; and fashionable
boarding houses. 5 Yesterday: he f made a
rich ';\u25a0 haul from the" rooms of \u25a0\u25a0, Harry j I*
Spillman in the Van Nuys, making* away,
wi th diamond . rings valued at $225, \ $53
in cash and a $10 pair of glasses. Again
the thief left no clew behind him, and the
detectives are as baffled as ever as to a
The Van Nuys" and the Hollan House,
which adjoins, have been the principal
sufferers from this thief who circum
scribes his field of .work. Thefts both
large and small have been matters of
frequent report to the department from
these places. On June 26 Mrs. Char
lotte Chase, the proprietress of the
Holland, notified the -police^ that the
clerk had been robbed of $225;
The theft in the Van Nuys yesterday
occurred while Mrs. Spillman and her
mother were preparing dinner in their
kitchen, which is some distance down
the hall from their bedroom. They did
not hear any one enter the room and
the . loss was the more a surprise to
them when it was learned ; that a key
was used to enter. . , . . .
: Mrs. Spillman and mother returned
home about 5 o'clock, and each placed
her. chatelaine , purse in the bureau
drawer before going to the kitchen.
Harry Spillman arrived home at* 5:25
and found the bedroom door, locked. He
went to the kitchen and returned with
his wife to get some money, but when
Mrs. Spillman opened her purse she was
astonished to find it empty. : A" hur
ried search revealed the fact that the
money was gone from .both purses,
with the exception of $10, which was
tucked away in the" corner of the : bag.
From Mrs. Spillman's purse was taken
,the four cherished diamond : rings.
From the mother's bag the robber se
cured $3 in silver*. and the $10 pair of
glasses. ' . ' "" ,
The police are certain that the theft
was committed by some person" acquaint

Special Dispatch to TbÂ« Call.
PORTLAND, "July - 19. â Thirty-one
hours and more of argument on the
part of the eleven other -jurors 'have
failed â¢ to convince â¢ J." O. Cook of '; Eu
gene,- Or.;a former clerk for the Bc-oth-
Kelley,; Lumber j Company, that - the | de
fendants, ;â¢ Congressman Williamson,
Van Gesner. and Marion .Biggs,- -are
guilty of having conspired to ;â¢ suborn

Haven, - after waiting until . after 8
o'clock to-night, retired to his home,
leaving. word that he would not return
again ; unless the jury should return a
verdict, ""."and \u25a0 then only providing i the
action should be taken prior to 10:30
o'clock. The Judge was not called and
the jury is again locked up for the
night.
Cook has been an interesting juror
from the first and has not been easy
under the yoke of the rules laid down.
Even at the beginning of the trial he
was disinclined to heed the admonition
of the court that he should neither read
the comments concerning, the caae as
published In the papers nor discuss the
case as he pleased.
During the trial Cook wemed to find
amusing passages In the evidence where
others could see nothing to provoke a
smile. It Is the supposition that the Jury
will ,be discharged to-morrow it it is not
able to reach a verdict by evening.
It is understood that the Government
has come into possession of new evidence
since the close of the trial that would
strengthen its case in the event of a
second hearing.
It Is learned that on j every ballot the
Jury has stood eleven for conviction and
one for acquittal.

FIVE HUNDRED WHALES
. DYING AT ONE TI3IE
May Go Ashore on Inlet tn . Straits of
- Magellan and
Perish.
"I saw 500 whales ashore at one time
on a beach in the Straits of Megellan,"
said Captain James Heylet of the Brit
ish navy at the Union depot. "Some
years ago my ship lay off Pearl. lnlet,
a small creek a mile and a half long,
opening into Port Salvador, which in
turn ODens into the South Atlantic by
a very narrow opening. One morning
a whirlwind appeared to be approach-
Ing, over the .water in the bay of San
Salvador, and soon this was made out
to be an enormous school of whales, so
thick that they seemed to be Jostling
each other. Nothing was seen but fins
and tails . and .the water, in foam all
around. \ t
"This* was In a flowing tide, and they
came into the inlet itself describing sort of
cycloldal curves until the inshore part of
the squadron took on a kelp reef.
Then a sudden pause seemed to seize
them all, and the unfortunate animals
went up the inlet full' speed, with the
water boiling in upon them and a great
wave coming after them, 'and they piled
up in hundreds on the beach. Then, as
there was a rising tide, they got off
again, but only to charge the opposite
beach, and this continued till the fol
lowing tide and loss of strength left
them high and dry all round the dreary
bay. \u25a0 . . ,
"Very few, old or young, lived â¢ more
than a quarter of an hour after their
final 'stranding. Some died quietly,
others beat the sand and water with
their tails, dyeing the water with their
blood.* By evening, after that' tide had
ebbed, there" were only five whales
afloat out ; of the more than 500 '\u25a0 that
had come into the inlet so majestically
that morning. '-
' Next day only, three were to be seen.
They - swam around for. a while, and
then.- as if disdaining to live when all
their companions were dead, they made
straight for the beach, and In a few
minutes had passed out' of existence.
The whales were from four to thirty
feet long/ the four-foot whales being
Just born."-
INQUIRY INTO
HUETER CASE
Grand Jury in San Jose in
Session During Morning
Listens to Four Witnesses
ADJOURNS TO FRIDAY
Woman Remains in the Jail
and Her Father Guards
Her From the Inquisitive
Scecial Dispatch to TbÂ» Call.
. SAN JOSE. July 19.â The Grand Jury
met this morning to investigate the cir
cumstances surrounding the death of
Gustav Hueter, during which Mrs. Kate
Hueter. the widow, is being held at the
county Jail. After hearing four witnesses,
the Grand Jury at noon adjourned to
next Friday.
The witnesses examined were Dr. R. P.
Gober, and Dr. F. W. of Ixra
Gatos, J. G. Grlndell, who resides near
the Hueter place and Deputy Sheriff
William Dreischmeyer of San Jose. Tba
testimony taken to-day waa merely in
regard to the body of Hueter when the
physicians and Grind ell arrived at the
house.
John Utechlg. the father of Mrs.
Hueter, remains constantly by the side
of his daughter and protects her from
newspaper .men. Mrs. Hueter has been
made comfortable in the office of the jail
and all her meals are sent In. . Mrs
Hueter was not called In before the
Grand Jury this morning and probably
will not be. Her father to-day denied
that she had made any confession that
she had been Intimate with a young
physician. The officers, however, declare
that she did.
ELECTRICITY FROM WASTE '*
FOR FARMING PURPOSES
Straw, Weeds, Etc., Can Be Used for
Fuel to Furnish the *"-â¢'
\u25a0Power.
While electricity has frequently been
recommended to the farmer as a con
venient means for plowing, operating
machinery, pumping water, etc., yec in
practice he has been rarely able to
avail himself of such assistance, since
farms cannot be located in mountain
ous country where waterpower.. .13
abundant, while coal and -gasoline for
engines to drive the dynamos cannot
be procured with sufficient cheapness
to make the undertaking a practical
success. Recently In France some in
teresting experiments have been car
ried on where various waste vegetable
products, such as straw, leaves, weeas,
unserviceable hay and . similar sÂ»b
stances have been used as fuel in gas
generators. It has been found thut
from such materials a low-carbon gus
can be evolved in vertical gas gener
ators, and by means of a ga3 motor
and dynamo electricity can be devel
oped. This can be done much cheaper
than by burning coal or petroleum
products and when a number of far ru
nners unite to maintain a plant that
will furnish about fifty or .seventy-five
horsepower it is believed that electric
ity could be distributed about tho
neighborhood - with considerable econ
omy. The method employed was to
collect the material, chopping the
straw and lik* substances, and then
after it Is dried, pressing it into bales
weighing about 1500 pounds per cubic
yard. As it has taken the farmers
of the Western Lnited States 'to de
velop the co-operative telephone line,
using, in some cases, fence wires as
conductors, so it may be possible that
French agriculturists will succeed in
generating electricity so economically
that it can be used not only for scien
tific, but also for practical farming:.
Career of Santa Cms.
Probably no other of the West
Indian Islands has had such a checker
ed career as Santa Cruz. In turn it has
belonged to Spain, which abandoned.it;
to England and , Holland jointly;
to England alone; to Spain again, which
fell upon tne colonists and destroyed
or deported them all; to France, which
took it "from Spain; to the Knights of
Malta, who received it as a gift from
France; to a private company of adven
turers. Then it was resumed possession
of by France, but abandoned, so that
in 1720 .it was uninhabited. Then it be
came 'no-man's . land in 1727, when
France took It again, and presently sold
It to a Danish company, which sold It in
turn to the King of Denmark. In 1301
England took it once more, gave; it
back to Denmark, repented and took it
away again in a few months, .held Â« it
for eight years, and then returned it . to
Denmark, which holds it still.â N. T.

EQUALIZERS DENIED
BEQUEST FOB TDIE
Plea That the Assessor Is
Behind in Work Un
availing.
. â¢ -
OAKLAND, July 15â The State Board
of Equalization this morning refused to
gTant the Board of Supervisors an exten
sion of time in which to complete its
labcre as a County Board of Equaliza
tion and in consequence the entire work
cf thejjeard must be completed between
July 22 and 23. This Is occasioned by the
fact that Assessor Henry P. Dalton has
not yet completed the^assessment rolls
end they will â¢ not be- - finished before
Saturday morning.
Daltcn claims that he has- not sufficient
help In getting out the rolls and for
several years past he has been granted
extensions of time In which to do this
work. This year he was allowed twenty
days. The refusal of the State Board to
grant the Board of Equalization a similar
extension has so shortened the time that
the property owners of the county will
have but one week in which to make
their complaints. The reason given by
the State Board was that It has to com
plete Its labors by September 1 and in
order to \u25a0do so must proceed with its
echedule and that It is now ready to
examine Alameda County assessments.

YONG HIGHWAYMEN BRING
SHOTGUN INTO PLAY.
One Shoots at Boys
Who Disobey Or
ders to Halt.
Banker s bon and
Companion Drive
C I â¢/
OAKLAND. July 19. â Robert Bowles,
the 6-year-old son of P. E. Bowles,
president of -the First National Bank of
this city, was slightly wounded yester
day afternoon while driving in the
Claremont district In an encounter with
two youthful amateur highwaymen.
That he was not killed is due only to
the fact that ha had succeeded in get
ting almost out of range of the weapon
of one of the young knights of the
road before the shot to enforce a com
mand to halt was fired.
The banker's son and Eddie Lelmert,
a younger brother of Walter Lelmert,
the manager of the real estate depart
ment of the Realty Syndicate, were
driving along Claremont avenue, in the
vicinity of the Country Club, when they
were suddenly ordered to halt by two
boys, who stepped out of the brush at
the eide of the road. Seeing that the
larger of the strangers was armed with
a shotgun, Bowles Ignored their order
to stop and lashed the ponies he was
driving into a run. After shouting to
them once more to halt, the boy with
the gun threw his weapon to his shoul
der and fired at the fleeing pair. One
of the shots pierced the left ear of the
banker's son and several struck the
back of the cart.
3IOTHEB. BREAKS GXTS.
At the time the shot was flred. how
ever, the boys In the cart were almost
out of range and the pellets that
struck the vehicle simply marked the
woodwork and fell to the ground.
Bowles and his companion at once re
turned to their homes in this city
and told their parents of what
had occurred and this morning 1 the po
lice were notified. The place where the
two boys were fired upon is outside the
city limits, but Detective George Kyte
was detailed on the case and after a
long search to-day he found the youths
who had essayed the role of highway
men.
The ehot was fired by Eugene Bar
tolli. who resides with his parents at
IS3 Bryant street, and his companion
was Rlxford Bobbins, whose home is
on Broadway, near the grounds of the
Country Club. Bartolli is but 15 years
of age and his companion is in his
twelfth year. When the detective called
at the Bartolli home, thia afternoon, the
boy had already 4eft-the~house and the
offlcer was 'unable to see him. Young
Bartolll had said nothing to his parents
of what had occurred and the mother
of the youth was much shocked when
she learned that her eon had narrowly
escaped arrest on a charge of murder.
Mrs. Bartolli's first action when she
learned of the affair was to take the
qua with which the shooting had been
done and break It to pieces in the pres
ence of the detective. \u25a0
PROSKCUTIOX IS UXLIKELV.
Roxford Robbins had also left home
this morning before the arrival of the
officer and his parents were likewise in
ignorance of the fact that their son had
been mixed up in what had nearly
proved a fatal adventure. The. parents
of neither of the boys can believe that
their sons . deliberately attempted to
hold up Bowles and Leimert, and think
that there must have been a quarrel
of some kind. They assured tha of
ficers, however, that the youngsters
should be properly punished for their
attempt to fill the two boys full of
shot. Some doubt is expressed by the
authorities as to whether the matter
will be allowed to rest with the punish
ment of the youthful culprits by their
parents and it may be that both will
be arrested and brought, to trial for
their offense.
The parents of the wounded boy, who
reside at 817 Grand avenue, were high
ly indignant at ; the unprovoked attack
which had been made on the two boys,
and had it not been for the fact that
their assailants have proved to be little
more than children there Is no doubt
that Bartolll and Robbins would be se
verely dealt with.-

You have Eetbefore-me to-night the toast,
"Our Civic Authorities." The â¢ term . suggests
the query, and wnai are our.elvie au
thoritiesr* ArÂ« they merely the personalities
of men selected ''from' time to time to legis
late and 'to execute the laws, or do they form,
in the broader sense, the symbol of power
granted by a free people, that the law 3 of the
city, the State and the nation shall be Justly
and fairly observed for the benefit of all?
In the olden' times rulers ruled for the bene
fit oi the rulers. In these latter days the doc
trine is that rulera shall rule for the benefit
of the ruled. Authority is the exemplification
of the law.'. The persons chosen by the people
to administer the law- are solemnly sworn to
uphold the statutes and to enforce the f ordi
nances that are upon the books.. To maintain
to the highest degree. or efficiency the 'Go-/-,
eminent under the law should be the highest
ambition of those -whom the people -"eelect. . To
prove recreant In.. the, slightest .degree to that
tremendous obligation' should warrant the most
severe retaliation upon 'the offender.
To me there is deep" responsibility. in- the terra;
"our \u25a0 civic authorities." . .The . -pÂ«cple â¢ haÂ«tf7
charged them with an imposing. duty land with*'
a 'trust that should be executed with f a fidelity,
greater even than that displayed In one's pri
vate affairs. 'It Is a.'Solemn and a sacred *e
eponslblllty that, should * not .be trifled with.;
The law is supreme. ,' It 1? the duty of all good
citizens to obey the .'law; and the defiance of.
law *iÂ» the first . step toward anarchy. The
man who deliberately defies the law, tbe* he
rich or be. he poor. Is tearing away the very
fundamentals of government, and that cannot
and will not be tolerated 'toy "our civic authori
ties" If they are faithful to thelr< trust." ': â¢ ;
â¢ I am one of those', who .see a, brighter v day;
dawning in this : fair nation. I believe thera
Is an- awakening of ' civic pride "In- our land
that will overthrow the evils that menace us.
There seems to be a cleaner and ' purer atmos
phere about us. â¢ We have a new â¢ standard
raised by the magnificent example of our peer
less President, Theodore ' Roosevelt. He : has
founded an alarm that 1Â» ringing forward and
backward through not : only our own country,
but has been heard over .the civilized world.
'Civic authority means more to-day than ever
it did. . It means a battle againet the selfish
greed of self-seeking; politicians. .. It means
the trlumj) of the "square ' deal" ; ;. that true
equality ' before the law which knows no -dis

GEORGE PETERSON LAID LOW
IN TWENTIETH ROUND.
YOUNGSTER BA TTLES GAMEL YYILLTHEEND
Chicago Boxer Out
classes Local
Boy.
Scores Five Knock
downs in the
Nineteenth.
Ac Gecrge Peterson writhed on the floor
of the arena at Colma last night in the
twentieth round of his fight with Buddy
Ryan for the welterweight championship
of the world, his seconds threw up the
cponge and thereby saved their charge
from the humiliation of being knocked
out. As it was, the lad was beaten to a
pulp, but. game to the core, he was about
to rise and fight again as long as he had
a bit of strength.
Five times in the previous round Ryan
had floored his young opponent with ter
riffic right and left hand punches to the
Jaw, but still the local boy refused to
quit. He arose each time, groggy and
dazed and carried the fight right into the
enemy's camp. He was outclassed and
beaten ar.d did not have a chance, yet
his gamer.ess was still with him and "he
refused to stay down.
The finish of the fight was as dramatic
es ever witnessed in California, When
the nineteenth round was about half
ended, the men clinched and as they
came out of the breakaway, Ryan shot
in a snappy right hand punch to the
law that put Peterson to the floor. The
lad seemed to be out and the spectators
rose to go. But when nine seconds had
been tolled off Peterson slowly rose to
his feet and staggered after his oppon
ent, who was as much surprised as any
of the cpectators.
PETERSON WOXT STAY DOWX.
Peterson made a lunge at Ryan and
the latter landed another ferocious punch
on the jaw. Again Peterson dropped to
the carpet, only to remain nine seconds
and come right back as full of fight as
his muddled brajn would allow. Twice
more he went down, when the welcome
clang of the gong sounded and the game
welter was carried to his corner amid the
cheers of the multitude. The seconds of
t?Te beaten man should have thrown up
the sponge then and there, but they al
lowed their charge to be led to the
slaughter and take an additional beating
when he was Just about able to keep on
his feet. â¢
From the moment the men entered the
ring Ryan outclassed the local welter
weight. It was a case of a game lad
matching his willingness against all the
science and experience of a world's
champion. Ryan ehowed his superiority
in nearly every round and but for Peter
pon's wonderful ability to sustain pun
ishment the mill would have ended long
before it did.
Peterson was nervous at the start and
it locked as If h!s finish would come soon.
But as round after round passed by he
gained his self-possession and managed
to wade in and exchange punches with ;
Ryan. But for all his willingness and
aggressiveness he never figured, for
Ryan's experience and ring generalship
told at all times and he kept beating. the
local boy down from the start.
RYAS USES BODY PUNCHES.
Once in a while Peterson would rally
a bit and land on Ryan. He sent in sev
eral damaging punches to the body and
landed a few on the jaw that shook up
the Chlcagoan. He also fiddled around
\u25a0with his left in several rounds; and both
ered Ryan some, but â¢while he was thus
engaged the champion was making good
Mcc of his own time by shooting In ter
rific body punches that were slowly sap
ping Peterson's strength.
The men entered the ring shortly before
10 o'clock. Ryan was Introduced as the
champion welter of the world by Billy
Jordan, and Peterson as the game cham
pion of England and California. The men
presented a striking contrast. Ryan be
ing short of stature with a build like Jef
fries, and Peterson tall and lanky and
patterened after the manner of Fitzslm
xnons. . -..</:
TVhen the men got together In the first

A Wart or Pimple
MAY BE CANCEROUS.
When a wart, mole or jjimple shows
tny sign of tenderness it is a warning
that baa blood is behind it. Often these
places are on the face, hands, legs or
other part of the body for years, andgive
so sign to cause uneasiness, and then
with a little rough handling, a slight cut
or bruise will develop into a sore that re-
fuses to heal, and the sufferer finds him-
self afflicted with a cancerous ulcer.
About three years aco a blister came
on the right side of my nose. It rrsw
epeedily in spite of all efforts to heal it
up; the pain was not very severe at first,
but increased when the sore began to
i nfiame and discharge matter. At times
the place would scab over and appear to
be getting well, but the scab would drop
off, leaving a red, angry looking ulcer. I
had almost despaired of ever curing it,
when ray attention was called to S. 8. S.,
and after taking a few bottles the sore
beeÂ«n to gradually grow smaller, thÂ«
discharge stopped and I was cured.

WORLD. WHO UPHELD HIS REPUTATION BY DEFEATING GEORGE PE
TERSON IN THE TWENTIETH ROUND OF THEIR FIGHT LAST NIGHT.
round and made several ineffective passes
at Ryan.. Buddy did not seem to be in
such a hurry and let it go with a couple
of light ones to the Jaw and body.
Peterson began to wade in a bit In the
third, landing a couple of lefts to the
jaw and stomach that made Ryan wince.
As they came out of a clinch Ryan land
ed a left on the jaw and at the same
time wrestled. Peterson went down on
his knees, but was up in a moment,
claiming a foul that was not allowed.
LOCAL BOY WADES IN.
Peterson began to gain confidence after
this round and waded - in .and mixed it
with the champion. But ror every blow
he struck he received three In return
that were slowly shaking nlm up. Ryan
played almost continually for the kidneys
and stomach and used a short right-hand
jolt and an uppercut most of the time.
Although Peterson was taxing an awful
beating all the time he did not begin
to show the effe.cts of It till about the
tenth round. He" was fighting at his best
in the fifth, sixth and seventh." wading
in occasionally and mixing It with his
husky opponent. But all the time he
had a great respect for his antagonist's
formidable right hand and liked to stay
at long range and let Ryan come at him.
The best blows landed by Peterson were
In the fifth round, when he rushed Ryan
into a corner and landed a hard left to
the stomach. He quickly followed it up
with a right* to the Jaw and Ryan broke
ground. It could be seen that the Chi
cago man did not like the body punches,
but after breaking ground he followed
Peterson up and punished him badly
about the body.
SEEMS EASY. FOR CHICAGOAN.
Peterson looked nearly in during the
seventh, though he rallied quickly. Ryan
landed a left / hook on the jaw that
staggered the local boy and he went Into
a clinch. Ho soon recovered from the
effects of thÂ» punch and came back at
Ryan with a hard left to the Jaw that
started the crowd cheering. He followed
up his lead, landing three or four of
the same kind, on Ryan's Jaw, but they
did not seem to feaze the champion. ..
From that time on till the. end of the
fight, Peterson never figured at all. He
occasionally would get In and bring
over a left, but the punches did* not
seem to have any steam behind "them.
Ryan kept Peterson moving around the
ring and when he cornered rhls man.
he would always shoot In a few of his
wicked short arm Jolts to the body.
It lokedas if Ryan could win in ; al
most any round, but Peterson stood the
pace well and refused to throw out any
distress signals, though he was gradu
ally weakening and his legs were fast
growing shaky under; him. . Ryan
seemed to be holding a > right-handed
haymaker in readiness, though ; for
6q<ne reason : he never brought \u25a0 lty over.
' LOOKS -LUCE NIGHT FOR PETE.
Ryan was looking to. land, the punch
that brought about the end for many j
rounds., but Peterson was. cautious and
managed to avoid it. Several times
Ryan tried the right' hand cross, but
never made good .with It till the nine
teenth , round, when he ' floored Peterson
coming out of- a clinch..
â¢In the fourteenth, . the milling was
fast, and it looked as if it would be cur
tains for Peterson after . Ryan : :had
brought over a right hand swing to the
jaw. But Peterson was -right \u25a0< there
with another of the same brand . and: a
moment later ; he " rocked Ryan with
still another that gave the local ; boy's
admirers ' hopes.' But that was ; about
the last rally Peterson made,' for. In , the
fifteenth Ryan started to follow his man
all ; over * the , ring, â¢ landing : rights ~ and
lefts to the Jaw andY body. : ' He con
tinued to use ', these tactics ; in the;six

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL; THURSDAY; \u25a0 JULY 20, 1005:
around he was up at-, the tap of the
bell and at his man like a tiger. He
shot In several hard ones to the kid
neys and Peterson began to cringe. As
they came out of 'a clinch Ryan saw. his
chance and came through with the
cross that helped hasten the end.
Ryan did not seem to feel the effects
of the fierce miling in the least. He was
apparently as fresh after the fight as
when he entered the ring. He never
lost his head except when Peterson
landed a jolty one to the Jaw and then
he always regained self-possession In
time to get after his man.-
IS POORLY SECONDED.
Ryan's best punches are a short right
hand jolt and an uppercut. He seems to
have these blows under perfect control
and they generally land when he cuts
them loose. Besides being a hard
puncher. Ryan is a very clever blocker
and managed to protect his.- stomach In
clever style when Peterson came at him.
Peterson was badly handled, his sec
onds being content to look on and say
little or nothing. .He had. to fight his
fight all by himself and. had no good
general to tell him a thing or two when
a bit of advice meant all In the world
to him.
The; fight attracted ah Immense
crowd, the pavilion being packed to Its
utmost capacity. The crdwd was well
handled and the fight fans were landed
back in this city before midnight Jim
my Britt, Gus Ruhlin. Jimmy Gardner
and Harry Tenny were Introduced.
Britt was the only one to make a
speech, informing the crowd that he
would fight Nelson : next provided the
latter would show a proper disposition.

Crock Welters Figure tn a Lively Ten-
Round : Go.
The curtain raiser, a ten-round go
between . Joe Thomas and George
Brown, was declared a draw by Referee
Billy Roche, though Thomas looked to
have the better of the milling. Brown,
however, "came" fast ' at the finish : and,"
though groggy, he waded rln and ex
changed , blow for blow. .
The fight opened with*. Brown-Jab
bing Thomas 'all over the rin* with his
left. .From, the aspect ~ of., the Initial
round, It would appear that Brown
would Jab himself, to victory in a few
rounds, but Thomas awoke from., his
nap in the second round and opened up
on Brown, forcing him all-over the
ring. '.'â¢:,- >CV;>^Aw<? >
From - that time till the ; sixth, . It was

Hope of Getting Away AVith
tlie Pennant^ Fades When
Commuters; Begin to Rally
UNCLE NEVER FIGURES
Hogaii Pitches Much Better
Ball Than Henley and His
Support Is Always Good
If the Seals <lid possess just the
faintest hope of bringing: home the flag:
It vanished yesterday, for the Com
muters waded in like big leaguers and
made monkeys out of the natives on
their return from the northwest. San
Francisco only figured once, and'then
the rally was cut short before thfe score
could be tied. - - *
â¢ All last week the Commuters played
bush ball against the Angels, but now"
that San Francisco has something to
gain by winning a few games Oakland
turns around and hands' out baseball
good enough to win a pennant in. any
man's league. Yesterday they fielded
without an error and tore over the
bases like a bunch of jackrabbits every
time a hit came through. '.
. Hogan worked off a spit ball oh the
Seals that seemed to be the rear candy.
He was clouted for three singles, and
It was lucky that San Francisco did
cop off" a run. Henley did not have
much, and the Commuters busied them
selves by taking many a long-ri'dc on
the ones he sought to turn into de
ceivers. '
Oakland started right off., in the
opening spasm, when old Papa Van
Haltren walked, and after Francks
and Dunleavy flew out he got ' awajt
with a steal. Kruger responded with
a drive to right and Van came in. In
the second the Commuters still stuck
to their good work and hammered two
more in on three hits. Had not Byrnes
been nailed trying to steal second
they might have been scoring?-~y,et.
". The sixth was the only round where
the Seals showed any signs of coming
through. Wilson got a hit and Goch
nauer was passed. Henley fanned and
Spencer forced "Wilson at third. , It
did not look very good then, but-Wal
dron drove one past Brick Devereaux
and Gochnauer tore in with the one
that saved a snowball.
Oakland played a beautiful grame in
the field. Francks ate up nine hard
chances at short, while Kelly was there
with an equal number at second. Ho
gan looked as if he was due to take an
aerial voyage several times, but he
managed to. weather the storm and al
ways pulled himself together in time
to prevent a rally. The score:

THE PUBLIC LANDS.
BY authority of Congress the President appointed a commission,
consisting' of Land Commissioner Richards, Mr. Newell of
the Geological Survey and Mr. Giffbrd Pinch'ot of the Forestry.
Bureau, to examine the land laws and report a plan for taking the
best care and making the best use of the remaining public lands.
Exclusive of Alaska the total area of the public lands was 1,441,430,
160 acres, of which one-third, or 473^36,402 acres, is yet public do
main and subject to some policy to determine its future.
The commission reports. that existing land laws do not fit the
conditions of the remaining public lands, and it might have said,
truthfully, that the laws were a misfit on a large part of the lands
that do not remain. For forty years and more, ever since land hunt
ers crossed the Missouri River, men with knowledge of the situa
tion have said the same thing, only to be accused of criminal land
grabbing intentions by theorists who do not know tillable land from
an alkali smitten desert. The Government has gone -oh, statutorily
assuming that the land laws which fitted the prairie States east of
the 'Missouri River were adapted to the vast region west of the
100 th meridian. So we have had timber entry restricted by law to
160 acres, when everybody who is not dodging the fool *killer
knows that no man can handle with any profit that area of lumber
forest. We have had also desert entry, under such regulations that
honest compliance with them was impossible, and we have refused
any further classification beyond agricultural, mineral, timber and
desert lands, and have administered them all in the arid region,
under the most idiotic misfit regulations and statutes..
The result is that one of the most valuable potencies of land
in that region has been nearly destroyed. It is a characteristic
upon which other uses of intermingled lands must depend for profit
in their cultivation. This potency was the capacity of the land for
grazing and for nothing else. The Government/ that wise and
strong agency in all matters properly belonging to it, flinched and
turned booby whenever it was pointed out that the grazing lands
should be classified and some provision made for their use in suffi
ciently large tracts for that business, and for the protection of the
natural forage which alone made them valuable. Travelers through
Arizona and New Mexico, on the railroads, traverse .hundreds of
miles of bleak desert where no plant roots in the blistered soil,
where once were luxuriant meadows. That desert is public domain,
stripped of its potential wealth bj' being used in" common, over
stocked and fed out, because the Government let it be so.
The commission has take/i up the question with some spirit. If
recommends desert land laws that can no more be complied with
than the present law. but it reports : "After thorough investigation
of the grazing problem, your commission is opposed to the imme
diate application of any rigid system to all grazing lands, but recom
mends that authority should be given the President to set aside
grazing districts by proclamation. Authority should be given the
Secretary of Agriculture to classify and appraise the grazing value
of lands in these districts; to appoint such officers as the care of
each district may require; to charge and collect a moderate fee for
grazing permits, and to make and apply appropriate regulations to
each district with the special object of bringing about the largest
permanent occupation of the country by actual settlers and home
seekers."
This advances the matter to the classification of grazing lands,
which if done twenty-five years ago would have saved to the meadow
millions of acres that are now the conquest of the desert. We doubt
the wisdom of the method of management of. the grazing lands pro
posed by the commission. The forage should be preserved, and we
do not believe this can be done under the permit system as well as
under the leasehold plan of Texas and Australia. \ But it is a be
ginning. The Government density on the subject has been pene
trated and the rather narrow plan proposed by the commission may
be expanded by experience.
What is needed is a sufficient degree of permanency in exclu
sive occupation by stockmen. This has been the need of the range
from the days of the nomads. In Genesis we read : "And Lot also,
which went with Abram, had flocks and herds and tents. And the
land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together,
for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together,
and there was strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and
the herdmen of Lot's cattle." So one went to the right and the
other to the left, for the land could not bear, that is to say, support,
their united herds, and they were over- stocking it.
OMISSION of news, cultivated as an art, is to be one of the
features aimed at by the controllers of a new experiment in
journalism undertaken in Chicago by John J. Hamilton and
his sister, respectively principal owner and editor-in-chief of the
National Daily Review. They believe that journalism has now de
veloped to such a stage that one of its early objects, the complete
gathering of all the news, is now practically attained ; and the next
step up is to learn how to eliminate â to choose out of the great
mass of news that which will give a paper character and lfterary
quality. The paper proposes to try several innovations, but this
is one of its main objects ; to find out what to leave unpublished and
yet to give the mind of the reader a true impression of life as it is
actually being lived around him, and so save him from ignorance of
the essentials of history as it is daily being made.
\u25a0 The new paper purposes especially to eliminate the sensational
and the scandalous. Crimes and other ugly things of life are to be
conspicuous by their absence, unless of historic importance of such
novel, nature as to need study, or of such moment they must be
told to prevent ignorance. Objection has been made to such a plan
in that it would cause people to live in a fool's paradise. They
would think the world better than it really is. In reply to that it
is urged that by giving prominence X/o crime men get a false view
of life. They learn more of the evil and unhappiness of 5 per cent
of the population than of the 95 per cent of normal folk who make
up the world around us.
Probably the golden mean of truth in these contentions is that
nearly all facts should be published, but due care exercised as to
the way they are handled. The public is entitled to know, every
important thing that happens, so that men can face life with wide
open eyes, know the right attitude betwixt trust and caution, and
be helped to mold personal character by noting the experiences of
all the world and adding this to self experiences. The right idea
is neither an enforced optimism nor an easily accepted pessimism,
but the meliorism that experience teaches; and for this it is neces-,
sary to have very wide knowledge of the facts and to form right
conclusions about them. It is good journalism to throw the search
light everywhere. Taking the world af large there is much more
harm done by concealment than by publicity. . v|;
".Thus,"' says Judge Alton B. Parker, "because greed; left to run riot,
has produced some bad conditions in cities and in great corporations we
arc advised to run headlong into municipal or , Government ownership and
operation. This policy is advocated in spite of the fact that, in other coun
tries and in the surroundings far more favorable for these experiments than
our own, they have uniformly interfered with- developmenfc^and curbed ini
tiative. In other words, the only alternative thus presented for the curbing
of greed is that of rushing wildly into the perils of overgovernment.". If

Where Gay Court
Once Played at
Life and Love

VERSAILLES, France, June 25.
The park and palace of Versailles have
an interest for the student of love as well
as for the student of history. Echoes
of old love stories linger around the
place, and poetry is in the air.
As you thread your way through its
woodland lanes and its marble corridors
you feel that you are in a splendid tomb
of past delights, where every shadow
hides some sweet but tragic personal
memory, and every beauty has some pa
thetic association with a broken human
joy. v
For here kings and queens, the great
of the earth, lived and loved, and played
a double game of hearts and statecraft.
Here gallant lords and lovely ladies, frail
as fair, . heralded Venus as queen of all
the gods, and bent the knee to Cupid
where he ruled the grove from the cen
ter of a woodland temr>le.
On every side are sad reminders of that
glittering court where love and laughter
reigned supreme, while pallid, envious
misery crowded closely against its gilded
gates.
To-day there is a quaint solemnity
about the elaborate palace and the arti
ficial gardens of Versailles: 1 * Modern folk
In modern dress look altogether out of
place. The scene offers a suitable back
ground for frivolity and hypocrisy, and
all the dainty vanities, of elaborate dis
play. It iÂ£ the proper setting for French
poetryâ not" for ' English prose. It offers
an appropriate stage for ncuwedy. and^
light lomance, and not for- somber trag-"
edy../.- . : , j . .'/\u25a0 i . .
One. cannot help but feel^ beholding it.
how- strangely Incongruous \u0084 must have
looked that mad Parisian' nYob of men
and" women' of the place who
stormed its' doors in Louis OC VI. 'S reign,
and drove the monarch from out its regal
shelter to the Tuilleries.
You are impressed by that strange qual
ity of French nature which expresses it
self y on the one hand In- art and beauty,
on the other in crueltyior' even in a fury
of rage. ' â¢ ' . ' " : /' " "
When you enter the woods 'of Ver
sailles, however, you leave behind such
terrible associations and come \u25a0 into . the
sentiment and romance which- linger yet
in these historic groves where a gay. de
generate court played at life and love
like woodland nymphs, or like shepherds
of Arcadia, where beautiful women held
sway â¢to whom Nature had given every
priceless gift except a conscience.
The ripple of running waters, the talk-
Ing voices of the poplar trees, each has
its story to recount. When you hear the
breezes whispering in the leafybowers of
the shaded grove you. almost believe 'tis
the ghosts of dead' loves and lost Joys
that you hear sighing softly to them
selves as they wander disconsolate among
the scenes of their remembered happi
ness. Overhead the lovenote of the night
ingale calls clearly, forming the only liv
ing word of love that breaks the sum
mer hush (Of the cool, fragrant air.
It Is with Versailles as it is with Rome
âher foundations are so much a part of
her that without them she would. not be
Versailles. It Is only when they play,
therefore, that you see her a princess,
In her coronet and robe of state, In the
full; beauty of l}er. queenly graceâ that,
you can conjure up with full success the
splendid -pageants, of long ago.

HOW THE FAKER
DRAWS A CROWD
The average New ' Yorker spends
many hours in the course of a year In
watching the doings of the "street fa
kers. Few of them, however, know that
fakers practice- some - well-planned
schemes to attract the;; New Yorker a
attention. ' ' ' " '*' - \u25a0
An old-time fakir known by .-the- so
briquet of "Big Bill." In telling a writer
for the New York World what those
schemes are revealedâ some eurtous
facts about the faker's art.
"One would suppose," said "Big Bill,
"that to attract the attention of such a
hustling, busy man as the New Yorker
is, one would have to do some wonder
ful, startling . feat. Well, that s far
from being the case. I've traveled
around all over the United States, but
I've found New York the easiest
of all to draw a crowd. Why the aver
age New Yorker Is so curious that no
will stop off to watch anything from a
cook baking cake In a restaurant win
dow to a man gazing at a skyscraper.
"And because the New Yorker is so
curious is why we fakers don't have to
use any startling scheme to catch nis
eye. In fact the schemes we use are
rather simple. I take up my station on
some corner along 'Fakers* Row."
"What, you never heard of that
neighborhood? Well. It's along Broad
way, Bowery. 'Fourteenth and Twenty
third streets where the large crowds
pass which we fellows call Fakers
Row. Well, as I said before. I stand
on one of those corners. I take out an
ordinary pocket handkerchief and stop
a passing small boy. I ask him to hold
one end of the handkerchief, while I
hold the other. I then with a flourish
of my hand place a silver dollar in
the center of v the handkerchief. By
this time the sidewalk begins to get
Impassable with Interested New York
ers. Then I roll the coin up slowly in
the handkerchief, place both In my
pocket and start in to show my goods.
"Some men in the crowd often look
disappointed. I suppose, they expected
me to do some clever trick with the
coin. But I had not promised to do
that. During the time I had handled
the coin I had not said a word.
' A good faker who understands nls
business does no talking while he is
working his scheme. "Tisn't necessary.
"As a rule, each faker has his own
original scheme, which no other faker
will copy. There's a silent understand
ing among them not to do that, be
cause the public would see it so many
times it would become too well ac
quainted with the same scheme and
would ignore it. So every chap invents
his own schemelet. A fellow I know
who 'fakes' shirt sleeve catchers has
his goods strung in a row on a strip of
cloth about a yard long and perhaps
six Inches wide. He spreads a hand
kerchief on the sidewalk, rolls up the
strip of cloth tightly and places It on
the handkerchief. The rolled cloth
glistens on all sides with the shiny
shirt-sleeve catchers.
"The 'fellow then" starts In to fan it
w'th his hat. Does he attract a crowd?
You bet! And in only about three min
uter, too. Another man uses a small
bottle filled with ground chalk.
"He spills a little of the chalk on
the sidewalk, very slowly strikes a
nurtch and places it to the chalk. What
happens, then, did you say? Why, the
match goes out, the fellow kicks tho
chalk into the gutter, opens up his
satchel and shows his 'goods,' " and "Big
Bill" smiled.
"There's many more schemes. l could
tell you. all on the same plan. But I
guess the ones I've mentioned oupht to
give you a good Idea of what we fakers
do to draw the crowds."
BUTCHER MAKES
STRONG PROTEST
Editor of The San Francisco Call â
Dear Sir: By reading the articles pub
lished in some of the city morning
papers of July 18. 1905. one would nat
urally think that the butchers of San
Francisco are using preservatives In
all the meats they sell. I would say
for the benefit of the few who have
been made a special target by un
scrupulous representatives of the press,
that we, the retail butchers of San
Francisco, do not have to use preserv
atives only in the shape of salt and
saltpetre. Neither do I believe that any
of the retail butchers are using- any
preservatives since it has been made
known to them last May that it was
injurious to health. The statement
made that we. the accused men, would
rather not make a statement so far as
butchers are concerned. Is an infernal
llei as I have tried several times to
have the truth printed. It seems that
we are to remain at the mercy, of the
liar. Respectfully yours.

Miss Bessie Kahn
Saves Life of
Aged Lady.
Leaps Through Door
Into Runaway
\u25a0
Elevator.
Miss Bessie Kahn, the young and
beautiful *>isuÂ«r of CongressmaS Julius
Kann, proved herself to brave in sav
ing the life of a friend yesterday after
noon that she v/ill henceforth be hon
ored as a htroine of whom Sau Fran
cisoo may feel justly proud. Without
thought that her life was in imminent
- danger of being crushed out, the girl
wrenched open the door of the ele
vator shaft in the Melrose Hotel. 1020
f Van Ness avenue, leaped Into the un
controlled car that was rushing up
ward, turned off the electric current
end stopped the flight of the cage Just
before It crashed Into the roof ol the
house. Within, helpless from fright,
was Mrs. Gildermacher. her life saved
by the quick action of Miss Kahn.
Mrs. Gtldermucber returned from
shopping to her home at the Melrose,
w here Mlts Kahn also has apartments.
The elderly lady had her arms full of
bundles, and, not seeing the elevator
boy anywhere around the hall, stepped
â¢lr.to the car and essayed to lift herself
to the fourth floor. She had often seen
the uniformed youngster do this, and
to her It seemed an easy task. Gently
at lirst the cage started upward, and I
-then it went with a rush. Terribly '
frightened. Mrs. Gildermacher screamed I
at the top of her voice for help, al
though it seemed impossible that any
..ene could do anything to aid her.
xMiss Kahn was' on the third floor,
waiting for the elevator. She heard
the cries of the terri3ed woman and
p-iw the danger. Witti all her young
strength she wrenched at the door of
the shaft. The lock was old and It
parted. The door flew open. As tho
eWator came by Miss Kahn threw her
6( If Into it. seized the lever with a
iir:n hand and pressed ft hard down.
Th*j momentum carried the cage past
the floor of the top story, and it came
to a standstill within a few feet of
the heavy rafters at the top of- the
shaft.
I Then, to chow that she was a-woman
still, although the people of her native
city would ever write "heroine" after
her name. Miss Bessie Kahn turned
faint. The elevator boy came running
up the Etairs^tc her rescue, Mrs. Gllr
dtrmacher \v(fs hysterical from the ef
fects of her fright.
Miss Kahn is very modest over the
affair and seeks to persuade her friends
that the art was commonplace. All yes
terday afternoon and evening she re
ceived the conjjratulatlons of her many
admirers. Not the least of these was
Mrs. Gildermacher herselX. an aged
woman, who clings to Miss Kahn and
.calls her her savior.

Republican League is Striving for Con
vention of Honorable Citizens
The San Francisco Republican league
has rendered excellent service to the com
munity by informing delinquent citizens
of their' neglect to register. The system,
adopted by the ldague gave the execu
tive committee a list of the - unregistered
voters in every precinct of the town.
Citizens' who were Yon that list "were
reminded of their civic obligations early
in the campaign." Voters who paid -no
heed to the first reminder were appealed
to the second time a few days before the
close of registration for the primary.
The result is a large Increase in the.reg
istered vote of the city. Future work of
the league will be in the direction of
bringing to the; polls on primary elec
tion day every registered voter who holds
to the oDlnion that there should be bet
ter and cleaner government for the city
of San Francisco. ; >
From this time until next Tuesday the
League force" in the several Assembly dis
tricts of the city will be engaged ) In : the
selection of men to be voted for; as dele-,
gates to the Republican nominating con
vention. The promoters of . the : league
entertain the belief that representa
tive citizens will be chosen. The fact is
recognized that a man may fairly
represent the views of the average cit
izenship of the district, even if he Is not
known to the city at large as a prominent
man of affairs. The Republican idea of a
representative convention Is a body of
delegates composed of men who are con
cerned In the welfare of San Francisco
men who work with head and hand to
improve their conditions in life, to edu
cate their children and . to make their
homes attractive. There are assurances
that the league tickets will represent the
best citizenship of the metropolis. -,
There is unquestionably a revolt against
A. Ruef in the Union Labor party. Men
prominent in the affairs of the organiza
tion do not hesitate to assert that^; the
party would gain strength and standing
by throwing the boss ; overboard. Ruef 's
plan is to create a convention of Janitors,
watchmen, pavtrs and clerks In the serv
ice of the city arid to give the nomina
tions of the labor party all along the line
to serviceable men who will take the
Ruef programme. *Ruef has a pretty firm
grasp on th<> so-called Union Labor Coun
ty Committee, but his following in â¢ the
United Labor League is limited. Leading
men pf the Labor League refuse to rec
ognize the pretended mastery of the boss.
They express a determination \u25a0to put in
tne field for the primary election delegate
tickets composed of men that will repre
sent in" the convention the interests of
labor rather than the political interests

BEEF'S PROGRAMME.
City Hall Jnnitora Capture United La
bor Lensae Meeting.
The meeting that was called at Teu
tonia Hall last night by the United Labor
League was prevented from accomplish
ing its purpose by the , usual tactics now
being pursued by the Ruef administra
tion. Mayor Schmitz showed that he was
in sympathy with the action taken by
being party to the programme that was
carried out by Thomas Eagan and the
Union Labor County Committee. Eagan
and his following of . 400 street . sweepers,
janitors and other employes of the mu
nicipality took possession of the meeting
and prevented the union' men who com
pose the United Labor League from
bringing their cause? before, the public.
It is evident that the present powers
that be in the Union La-oor party are
trying to prevent- the organization' of
union labor men, unless they can be
handled as a piece, club to further the
Interests of Abe Ruef. v
The meeting was opened by Chairman
H. :,M. Alexander â of the United Labor
League. Before, however, any . business
could be accomplished the Eagan crowd
substituted George B. Benham as tem
porary chairman. Walter Gallagher was
the first and only speaker of the United
Labor League who was allowed to ad
dress the meeting.
P. H. McCarthy, in his speech, said that
he represented the building trades of this
city . and he wanted to call attention ; to
the methods, of deception Â£ used by that
Â«nemy of organized labor "the Citizens'
Alliance."
Mayor ' Schmitz in his remarks desired
to remind all those present that it was
the Intention and purpose of the Citizens'
Alliance toy form a chaim in the ranks
of organized labor. - ... _ ,
In accordance with ' the plan mapped
out by v the Ruef combination the follow
ing resolutions were adopted:
Resolved, There la In this city an organ
ization known as the United Labor League 1 , or
ganized ostensibly to flght politically the Citi
zens' Alliance, the membership of which in
cludes somo -of the best and etanchest union
men,- unshaken', in their devotion" to union
principles, and steadfast In their loyalty to the
legally constituted - County . Committee of the
Union Labor party; thererore, be It r ' " : ;
Resolved, ' That this association of union la
bor men, regardless of former political affilia
tions, ilo hereby pledge themselves to foster,
aid and support the . County Committee of I the
Union Labor, party, and \u25a0 unhesitatingly urge
the nomination and re-election of labor's lrro
proachable champion. Mayor Eugene Schmitz.
These â¢ resolutions,. â¢ however, V did ' not
emanate from : the United Labor,. League
and received no support from the mem
bers of that faction f who I were present.
v ; The action of , Mayor Schmitz : in lend
ing himself as a party to such action as
that taken at the Teutonia Hall: meeting
will not tend to increase- his "popularity
with the union men of this city.

WASHINGTON 1 ,, July V' l9.-â Assistant
Secretary of Agriculture jWillett { M.
.Hayes has taken hold of the affairs of
'the Bureau'^of "Statistics/ with Instruc
tions from Secretary Wilson, Issued by
President Roosevelt, to cleanse the' bu-"
reau of the stigma / of .jthe cotton; leak
scandal. His? authority* is unlimited. It
is likely there will; be ,a complete re
organization lof the v force . employed jin
the statistical department. Secretary.
Wilson said i to-day that, hereafter, if
there .were . accusations j against the in
tegrity of the bureau; they, must be di
rected against himself or. Assistant Sec
retary Hayes, as he had no intention of
allowing anyiother persons access to
information that might be used in
stock Jobbing.
Hayes probably will be in charge of
the bureau until, after Congress as
sembles. As it is believed that a com
petent man to take the place of Hyde,
who resigned- yesterday as chief stat
istician, cannot |be had for the salary
paid by. the Government, $1400 a year,
Congress will be asked to Increase the
salary." ;';..'/ - *\u25a0\u25a0.": â¢\u25a0*-*"-:-. .â¢-.â¢ .V., / \u25a0\u25a0-.-\u25a0\u25a0

PLANNING NEW
SMELTER WORKS
The smelter trust, of which Daniel Gug
genheim of New v York, now In this city,
Is the head, Is considering plans for es
tablishing a gigantic smelting plant at a
point, yet to be selected, on the bay shore
between San Francisco and Port Costa-
It is proposed to have the works located
convenient to the* rails of both the South
ern Paclflo and the Santa Fe companies
and with this end in view the representa
tives of the . trust, since their arrival in
this city, have been conferring with the
officials of the two transcontinental lines.
Yesterday General Manager E. E. Cal
vin of the Southern Pacific Company,
with Edward L.'Newhouse, a director In
the American Securities Company, S. W.
Eccles, traffic manager, and several other
officials of the latter concern,- went up the
road as far as Port Costa for the pur
pose of ; inspecting localities';, suitable for
the big establishment.' They first visited
the Selby Works and then slowly came
down the Southern Pacific tracks, making
a careful survey of the land along the
bay shore. When seen last night at the
St.' Francis Hotel, where the Guggenheim
people are making their headquarters. Di
rector Newhouse refused y to . make any
statement, explaining that It was not his
custom to discuss In I public the affairs
of the concern in which he is an Im
portant . factor. ' . .
â¢From reliable sources, however, it was
learned that - the proposed new - smelter
was one. of the -matters that caused the
officials of the. trust to come West. It
has been realized that the Selby smelter
Is inadequate for the extensive business
.which the trust intends to develop on this
coast. ; It was announced several days
ago by Daniel Guggenheim that his com
pany; would enlarge the works -at Port
Costa, but, since then the officials of the
trust have been made to realize that the
site of the works Is not of sufficient size
to permit the improvements "contemplated.
In consequence it has . been , decided to
erect another and larger works, similar,
If not superior to those at Tacoma, r at
a point farther south, where connections
can be made with both the Southern Jfa
clflc and the Santa Fe lines. ; It was ex
plained by one of the representatives of
the 'trust last evening that '\u25a0 connection
\u25a0with the Santa , Fe lines Is desired in or
der to handle '\u25a0 the ? ores of 'â¢ many of ; tha
big mines in the -southwest, some - of
which are now being snipped to El Paso.
Those from Mexico and- other," points
along the southern coast will be brought
north by the water route and transferred
to ; the new works with ;. 1 the c aid of
wharves, which will be built if the project
is carried through.
. In â¢ looking' over, the ground yesterday
careful consideration was given to \ lo
cations of farming lands In the vicinity of
the various points from which a suitable
site -for a nÂ«w smelter, may be selected.
It is very likely that before purchasing a
site the : trust officials will secure title to
many pieces of land adjacent to the -bay
shore in â¢ order to obviate i the possibility
of fanners protesting s against the estab
lishment of the new works. .^ "V

"Captain Bruguiere reports that from the
day the Sherman left Manila, until she
reached Honolulu the weather was
stormy, nasty and disagreeable. They
departed from Manila in a driving rain
storm, which followed them for nearly
three weeks. .; r
. While the transport was lying at Hono
lulu, Chief Officer S. A. Kldston had a
fight with Chief Plumber " O'Dougherty.
The plumber Insisted on going ashore
against the wishes of the chief. The re
sult was that . to enforce discipline, Kid
ston hit O'Dougherty a blow on the jaw
and knocked .him; down. Colonel Ray
heard of the fracas . and not knowing
what had caused It, ordered Kidston
locked up. When the truth of the story
was ascertained, Kidston was at once re
leased.
Only one death occurred on the trip
and that was. just as the Sherman was
entering the harbor here yesterday.
Private Joseph , Sinclair, Company M.
Third Battery, Artillery Corps, had be.en
sick during the whole voyage with dysen

TENDERS CITY
VALUABLE GIFT
United States Government
Would Give Rare Exhibit
From Philippine Islands
COST OF MOVING $5000
H. "W., Furlong Suggests
That Municipality Assist in-
Securing the Collection
An offerto give to this city tlje Phil
ippine section of the "War Department
exhibit "in the United States Govern
ment building at the Lewis and Clark
Exposition. Portland, was received
yesterday by the Pacific Commercial
Museum from Charles II - Hall, who la
in charge of the section.
The exhibit Is composed of historical,
ethnological and : particularly commer
cial and industrial productions of the
Philippine Islands, and Ms practically
.the one which was shown/at the "World s
Fair. St. Louis.
The -collection was made by the Uni
ted States Government at an enormous
cost. Not least among: the exhibits are
natural and manufactured products of
the , Islands, with the various machin
ery, used by the Filipinos In produc
tion, which affords to those interested
in the extension of trade in the Philip
pines an adequate Idea of the limits
of supply there.
Speaking of the offer. H. "W. Furlong,
assistant secretary of the Pacific Com
mercial Museum, said:
San Francisco can have this remarkabl*
and valuable exhibit for the mere cost or
incidental expenses connected with the trans
fer | and transportation, which woald be ap
proximately $5000. There is no doubt that
if we lose the opportunity some other of th*
progressive cities on the Paciflo Coast wi;i
avail Itself of the offer.
San Francisco Is drawn so elosÂ« to the
Philippines .that we can hardly allow the
diversion of an exhibit of so much educational
and Industrial Interest into the hands of a
rival community.
Since the only condition attached to thÂ«
offer by the United States Government la
that the exhibit shall always bÂ« free to the
public I consider that the municipality should
atd In securing: It. Only prompt action on
the part or public spirited organizations and
individuals will make It possible for San Fran
cisco to avail Itself of the offer.
j)[AICES ANOTHER MOVE
M -TaHAEASS CLUTE
Works Board Orders Him to
Put on Twenty More
Teams.
The Board of Public Works took an
other step yesterday in its efforts to
discredit the action. of the Board of
Supervisors in awarding to A. B. Clute
the contract for removing sweepings
from the public streets* at .'a cost less
than formerly v paid a Schmitz favorite.
It made a demand on A. B. Clute to fur
nish the twenty additional teams it or
dered him Saturday to put to work.
Clute sent a communication, in which
he refused to comply with the
of the board to put on twentjr addi
tional teams. He stated in it that with
seven extra teams he can do all that
is necessary. Clute says the condition
of the streets is not such as to neces
sitate twenty extra teams.
Superintendent Cowden said there
were sixty loads left on the streets
Tuesday night,' but that Clute was do
ing better work and could clear up the
streets in one day if he'put twenty ex
tra teams to work. Cowden said Clute
was not satisfactory in some "of his
methods, but was securing some of the
big wagons formerly used. Maestretti
said Clute would have to furnish suf
ficient teams to clean up the accumu
lated dirt at once or else give up his
contract. Cowden was notified to notify
Clute of the board's demand and to re
port upon, the condition of the streets
this morning.
The Supervisors' - Street Committee
adopted a resolution reciting that Clute
is not being granted the necessary
assistance by the Board " of : Works in
loading and that his bills for any addi
tional work entailed on him. to remove
the dirt and for any additional teams
he may be compelled to furnish shall be
paid.
The committee notified the Board of
Works that it will not pass demands
for ; teams furnished for the flushing
machines in - excess of $4 4S under
Clute's contract.

ISLAND GOATS
DIE BY SCORES
Thousands of Them Perish
From Lack of Water on
Guadalupe in the Pacific
CAUSED BY POACHEES
All Drinking Places Covered
and the Animals Left to
Meet Death in Cruel Form
Special DUpatcb to Tha Call.
SAX DIEGO, July 19. â Officer* of the
steamship St. Denis, which has arrived
In port from Mexico, reports that thou
sands of goats have died from thirst
on Guadalupe Island during the past
few weeks as th* result of the work
of poachers, who covered up the water
holes on the island. These poachers
have been in the habit of going to the
island from San Diego and slaughter
ing the goats for their hides. The ex
pedient adopted by some is to cover up
all the springs on the island except
one. thus causing the animals to flock
to this ono particular spot, where a
corral has been erected. "When the goats
come for water they are driven into
the corral and the slaughter then be
gins.
The last poachers went away and left
the waterholes covered up. The effect
is now pitiful In the extreme. All over
the island are the dead bodies of the
goats that have perished through lack
of water. The Mexican, Government
has taken up the matter and It is an
nounced- that soldiers will be stationed
on the island In the future and that a
gunboat will patrol the waters.

FOSTER CODLIN
MOTH'S ENEMY
State Employes Earnestly
Preparing to Propagate
Death - Dealing Parasite
THRIVES IN THIS STATE
Thousands of the Wasps to
Be Produced and Sent Out
to California Orchards
The ofSce of the State Commissioner of
Horticulture In the Ferry building will
eooh present a busy scene, as the of
ficials In charge of the . work there are
making extensive preparations to propa
gate on a large scale the newly discov
ered parasite of the codlin moth which
bears the formidable name of Ephlaltes
carbonarious. - -
It will be remembered that this Is the
wasp-like creature with the deadly rapier
which deals death to the worm in the
apple, and a parasite that the fruit grow
ers of this as well as all other States
have longed- for for many, years. Since
It has been fully demonstrated that they
will thrive, and do excellent work in our
State, the Horticultural Commission is
making preparations to supply the many
hundred application* that they now have
on their books.
Unique traps are now under construc
tion, that will be placed in many sec
tions of the State, especially in the pack
ins houses and around cutting tables to
capture the worms, which are necessary
to breed this valuable parasite on.
These traps will be sent all oveT the
State wherever there is a chance to cap
ture the worms and then they will be
sent back to thÂ» insectary of the com
mission in the Perry building; where they
will be placed in the especially arranged
breeding cases, from -which thousands of
the wasps will be feared and distributed
all over California In the apple orchards,
to prey upon this pest.
The parasites now on hand are in cold
storage, in the pupae stage, or rather a
stage which is Just before they turn Into
the mature wasps, and In this condition,
while remaining In cold storage, their
development is arrested. As soon as the
required amount of worms has been re
ceived, they will be placed in the cases
and the parasites removed from their
cold apartments and placed in the incu
bators, from which they will soon emerge
as mature parasites.
The co-operation of every grower In the
State that Is interested in apple and fruit
growing is earnestly solicited, and an
urgent call has been made for worms to
assist In the work of propagation.
All parties having apple worms In large
Quantities should send them as soon as
possible to the ofnee of the Commissioner
In the Ferry building, where they will be
thankfully received and can be utilized
to good advantage In this good work.
The State Commission of Horticulture
received yesterday the diploma awarded
for the case of "beneficial Insects and
parasites." entitled "Bug Versus Bug."

Wall-Street Outlook.
1 . The New York circular of J. S. Bach* & Co.
- *ays: :
"So far as the outlook for the future Is
concerned, steel stocks are worth more to-day
than ever before.
"The Government crop report for July sur
passed expectations, and ehould no further
carnage occur Insures to me country enor
mous crops, both of spring and winter wheat
and cÂ£ corn. Adding to the Increase in the
American wheat crops an Increase of 40,000,<i00
bushels Ui the Canadian crop there Is prom
.lsed a tctal wheat yield of 190.000,000 bushels
more tfcan was harvested in 1904. The corn
crop lr Indicated to be 114,000,000 bushels more
tfcan the indicated crop at the same time a
I year ago.
"Increases have already taken place In the
dividends of Baltimore and Ohio and Reading,
and la due time the Norfolk and Western divi
dend will be advanced. For Pennsylvania
j these increased disbursements meant a great,
deal. The stock looks exceedingly cheap and
Is easily worth 100 under tiie present condl
tlCMs. Dividend action on the Hill stocks and
* on Union Pacific has doubtless been withheld
jiecjlng better assurance In regard to the
croÂ£,s, but the Union Pacific meeting Is to
take place r.ext week end a 5 per cent rate Is
expected. The long- deferred "melon cutting"
for the Northern Pacific and Great Northern
stockholders will probably take place in the
not far distant future, and we look confidently
lor much higher prices for these securities.
* "Unfavorable factor* in the situation are
transitory character. Money rates will prob
ably advance in the autumn, and railroad rat*
legislation exercise considerable Influence;
meantime crop ecares may occur at any time.
On the other hand, large banking Interests
â¢ ere uniformly bullish on the situation, and
look to the favorable crops, excellent business
conditions and increases in railroad dividends
to send prices to a much higher level. The
Â» market may decline a few points, but the ten-
is upward, and we feel no hesitation
in advising the purchase of good
ctocks."

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. July 19.â The professional lim
its of the operations in stocks were strictly
maintained to-day, but within those limits
speculation was allowed rather more ecope
end traders enlarge* their operations to some
extent, inducing some more striding price
movements than yesterday. The increase in
the vivacity of the trading was only by com
parison with the lethargy of yesterday an-1
the appearance of the market suggested con
tinuing Bomnolency. Much of this effect was
attributed to the excessive heat, which took
the energy out of all degrees of human activ
ity. The increased breadtn or the market was
owing almost wholly to the revived effect of
rumors regarding Northern Securities affairs.
The fixed belief that the dividend on Union
Pacific is to be Increased to a 5 per cent rate
at to-morrow's meeting, of directors has ap
parently lost Its efficiency and then it was
reported there was to be a sale of Union Pa
cific's Northern Securities assets. It will be
remembered that these aeeets resoH'e them
eelves finally into minority holdings of North
ern Pacific and Great Nortnern preferred In
place of the majority and control of Northern
" Pacific which the Union Pacific put Into the
original merger. Union Pacific's desire to dls-
I>oee of its assets has therefore been as
sumed and the movement of prices to-day was
pointed to : as Indicating advantageous term*
for all concerned. The whole matter remained
In the realm of conjecture without a word of
Vjtf.cial information for guidance. The 1 action
L Illinois Central was not encouraging to
?irose who are hoping for rising prices to fol-
Jow news of increased dividends. There was
room to attribute the reaction from the early
advance in that stock to the manner of de
claring the dividend, the half per cent addi
tion being d<elgnated extra, as on the pre
ceding disbursement, instead of being called
a regular semi-annual dividend of 3% per cent.
P.umor was busy with an alleged meeting of
Erie directors to declare on initial dividend
ca the second preferred stork, but these also
v. ere unsubstantiated. Pittsburg Coal preferred
suffered fom the paesing of Its quaterly divi
dend Gross earnings reported by railroads
for the second week of July were uniformly
higher than last year's similar period. The
recent more active demand for money in loans
on time was perceptibly relaxed, and the
proceeds of loan bills in the exchange market
lrcreased the supply Â«o that the tone for time
money became easy. Rates for call loan*
were also inclined to yield. The few striking
gairs in prices were poorly held and the mar
ket closed easy, with a ragged showing of
moderate trains and losses.

. ' The ' Hay ~ circular : of < Somera ' & \u25a0 Co. i says : ..
\u25a0'â¢*\u25a0:' "There [ has ,'been i a* marked. increase ; in' ship-?
ments of Hay. to market I during j the past week,
the total showing 6000 tons.; the heaviest weekly
arrivals wfor^ many .i months. This \is & the ,; be- '\u25a0
Sinning tof the" rush that has been anticipated
for ' some , time past and , unless cars become
scarce ,we will- probably. 'have very, plentiful
shipments ! from now \u25a0 until the middle of Sep
tember, at which time we generally have rain..
The market - has -weakened â¢ perceptibly under
these , heavy., arrivals a and it. looks as though
there will be a .still further, decline. There Is
a ' very \u25a0'. heavy crop of Hay on â¢ thÂ«S lowlands
around San Francisco Bay, so that arrivals by
water .will be exceedingly plentiful from now
on, -especially as- there is but \u25a0 little storage
facilities in these same districts.
"The -Government - has -just advertised for
1000 tons of Hay for immediate shipment; this
Is the I first call of the kind . that we have ] had
for several months. ; This quantity is not suffi
cient to affect â¢ the market and as there -is
plenty of Hay all along the coast, the outlook
continues . rather discouraging for the shipping
trade. : - ... .
VQuite a number of. the best lots of Hay
have been purchased in the country, although
the majority .of dealers seem /.disinclined- to
speculate at : prevailing figures. To sum up,
we would say that the choicest grades of both
Wheat; and. Tame Oat Hay will probably hold
fairly :; firm throughout * the \u25a0' season for retail
purposes, but all \u25a0'\u25a0 other . grades will weaken

The firmness in Butter continues and, while
most of the r trade are averse to seeing the
market go-up any . more at present." aÂ» they
fear Imports from- the -East and from the San

Angeles, the market is going up all the same.
The fact is fancy creamery is a scarce article
here at present, though receipts of ordinary
grades are as. liberal as ever.
Cheese is easy at. -the decline noted yester
day, with abundant' supplies on hand
There is nothing new in Eggs, which are
steady, with some receivers - reporting an ac

yesterday, there being a- brisk demand for

there were large lines still uncared for at the
close. \u25a0 Prices . of . the other tree fruits stood
about as r previously quoted, -Figs \u25a0 being the
only description to show any firmness. Grapes
and Melons were plentiful and dull, the weath
er still being against trade. In the Berry line
Strawberries and Blackberries were exceedingly
dull end lower/while Loganberries and Rasp
berries rule,d firm under light supplies; J Prices
of Citrus goods were unchanged and there was
continued dullness in all descriptions. Mexican

Harrison's circular says: "Since the de
parture of . the steamship Ventura there has .
been but one arrival of Australian Coal, via:
Loudon Hill. 22ti5 tons. The loading list of
Coal carriers from Newcastle, N. S. W., foots
up. twenty-one vessels, with a carrying capa<
city of about 60,000 tons. No new freight en
gagements are reported. r although very fair
offers are being made, but ship-owners evi
dently do not like the appearance of San Fran
cisco as a profitable port to order their ships
to. The present outlook for future grain char
ters this year is very discouraging. The un
settled condition of Coal laborers In British
Columbia and Newcastle. N. S. W. would
under ordinary circumstances have created a
marked advance in - the local prices of Coal
here, whereas no change Is apparent. This Is
very strong evidence that there is ample fuel
"on hand for all requirements and that th* 1
quantity required for our uses is becoming
annually less. /The sales of Coalfpr domestic
uses for the months of July. August and Sep
tember always become materially diminished,
as spring weather then prevails. There Is Â«
bounteous supply of fuel oil being dally de
livered, with an ample reserve of the same to
draw from, as ' productive " v.-ells are being
opened all through the oil sections The oil
is delivered at about the same price] and con
tracts are being offered extending over long
periods at unchanged values." - T-*'-. \u25a0

SELECTING JURY
IN SCHERF CASE
Driver of Pound Wagon Who
Shot Eudolph W. Schultze
on Trial ; for His Life
NINE MEN AEE SWORN
Sereral Talesmen Are Ex
cused Owing to Admission
: That They Are Prejudiced
f. A Jury Is being impaneled in Judge
Lawlor** court to try Gustave Scherf.
charged with murder. The defendant
IB represented by N. C. Coghlan. ,and
District Attorney Byington end Assist
ant District Attorney Ferral are repr
esenting the people. Xlne Jurors
.were accepted yesterday when the ve
nire was exhausted and a special ve
nire of 30 was issued returnable this
Afternoon at 2 o'clock. Many of the
Jurors were excused because they ad
mitted being prejudiced through read
fng the accounts of the murder in the
newspapers.
Scherf was the driver of a pound
wagon and he shot and killed Rudolph
JV. Schultze, a shipbuilder, in front of
"his residence at 1183 Fifth avenue.
South San Francisco, on August 24.
Two dogs belonging: to Schultze were
playing in front of the house when the
pound man drove up and Charles "Wein
traut and Arthur Murphy jumped off
the wagon aid tried to catch the dogs
In nets. Schultze and his brother
,TVilliaxn ran out of the shipbuilding
yard to save the canines.
â¢ Schultze paid attention to the smaller
of the dogs, -which was a pet. of his
daughter Ethel, and he reached it just
e.s Murphy threw the net, which went
over Schultze's head. Schultze stumbled
over a plank and fell on his knees.
While Schultze was struggling to free
himself from the net. Scherf. who was
seated. on the wagon, pulled a revolver
out of his"pocke\ and fired at him. The
other two ' men Jumped on the wagon
and with Scherf drove away.
Schultze crawled, on his hands and
knee* toward the front steps of his
home. His daughter Ethel had been
looking' -out of the window and ran
downstairs to meet her father. He had
crawled half way up the steps when
the reached him. He said, "Kiss me,
Ethel." - t ' She pressed her lips 'to his
and that moment "he expired. Scherf
was captured that evening.' ' He was
Indicted -by the Grand Jury on . the
charge of murder.
The' trial was delayed because Attor
ney Frank J. Murphy/ who at first, rep
resented ;SCherf. took the case, before
the United States Supreme Court 'on a
question of jurisdiction of the Grand
Jury.
The Jurors accepted yesterday were:
Felix Coblentz, John DeL. Jerrup, Sam
uel Blbo, Samuel P. Holden. Harry
Unna, Albert Meyer. Valentine Lap
lanch, George M. Perine and Henry

mer convict at San Quentin, who ac
cuses Kirk of unprofessional conduct.
Only the preliminary steps were taken

The accusation made against the at
torney is that he accepted a fee for
services which he failed to render and
which, according to the testimony of the

mately performed. The auestlon the
committee is to solve is whether Kirk
performed a. legitimate" service* or
whether he received money under false

Cook alleges that while serving a
sentence in the penitentiary for an as
sault, he made' application to the Board

alleges there were nearly 200 applica
tions ahead of his, and that he con
sulted Kirk in the matter and the at

would be 'brought before the boar<T at
an early date. Cook alleges that he
paid the: attorney a fee, but that Kirk
failed to keep his ..promise.

SCOTT PLANSif GAINST :
HIRING EXTEA CLERKS
Arranges to Have Regular
Force Make Oitf Tax Bills
for Collection.-.
. Tax Collector Scott.decided yesterday
to get along- without extra clerks this
year in the preparation of tax bills for
collection - in. November. -Scott's action
will result in a material saving In "the
appropriation\ of -,532,400' made in the
budget for clerk hire in his, office.
Scott did a little figuring on his own
account and ascertained that there ire
exactly 100,000 tax -bills to be, ;> iriade
up." >He figures -that his regular* force
of ,tw'enty T *nihe.' deputies and .. clerks
willjbe .able -to^. make, .out the bills ai
therate of about 4000 .per day. This
will necessitate. the.making v of 138 bills
by each' clerk oh an average,; and Scott
thinks .-the, work ! -.can .be .done in . the
twenty-five .working 'Â«days/in : ;August.
'Then the. bills will have' to be checked
again, which will, take. twelve days. In
that way . Scott . expects to . turn
the books . over '\u25a0'.-: to . the Auditor
again', -on - September 15, as re
quired by law. v The* heavy collection
of license, taxes, will- be completed by

\u25a0â¢Heretofore, thirty,,- or more extra

SEEKS TO CANCEL DEED
Asserts Assignment of Prop
erty Was Made for Purpose
of Evading an Execution
Nora Helen Gertrude Jenner, for
merly Nora Helen Gertrude Finnistone
O'Neil Murphy, filed a suit yesterday. ln
which she charges that her former hus
band, .Bertram Samuel Joseph Finnia
tone O'Neil Murphy, a resident of Lon
don., and Attorney L.M. Hoefler, of the
firm of Bishop and Hoefler, have been
guilty of fraud in an effort to .wren
from her the fruits of an alimony judg
ment she obtained against Murphy
after* years of endeavor and litigation.
It was while they were abroad that
Murphy, and the woman that was â¢ then
his wife disagreed. Litigation began
and the then Mrs. Murphy sued for a
divorce. She established her charges
and. was given a decree, "together vith
an order for a stipulated monthly al
lowance. She. then returned to this
city, where Murphy's property inter
ests are located. Presenting the judg
ment obtained in the British court, she
established her right to execution
against the properties, of her foiv.vÂ»r
husband and judgment in her favor was
entered in the Superior Court, the ali
mony being due her amounting to
18284 13. The judgment was placed
In the hands of the Sheriff .for execu
tion and he levied on the defendant's
interest in the Murphy building, at
Market and Jones streets. 53
\u25a0 After a due course of advertising, the
Sheriff announced that he . would auc
tion ' off the property to satisfy the
judgment. The bidding was not spir
ited and Mrs. Murphy bid in the prop
erty for $2000. In her suit filed yes
terday"she says she waited the statu
tory period and-'then went to. Sheriff
Curtis and demanded that he execute a
deed. to her-for ; the property she had
bought in under her judgment. Then,
she says, the Sheriff informed her that
Attorney Hoefler had appeared and an
nounced that he would redeem the
property, a deed executed
by Daniel .T. Murphy, . as attorney in
fact for B. %S. J. F. O"N. Murphy, in
which the consideration named was. slo.
Mrs. Jenner, the plaintiff, formerly
Mrs. Murphy, says that , the deed held
by Hoefler is,, only . a pretended convey
ance; that the consideration named is a
f als^ ; one ' arid is : on its. face a fraud,
presented for the sole purpose* of de
feating, her of her* rights, i She; asks
that the instrument held by Hoefler be
canceled and that a writ Issue out of
the court compelling the Sheriff to exe
cute in her .'favor/a good and- sufficient
conveyance7'tb the property, acceping
in lieu thereof ; the plaintiff's' satisfac

\u25a0"V Attorney Frank H. Powers, of the
firm 61 Heller. & Powers, claims that
,tMe 'property was hot redeemed within
the usual' six months by Hoefler and
that the^ latter bought it back at the
end "of a year's time. ; which was un
lawful at the time" of the sale. Attor
ney Rlx of the firm of Bishop & Hoefler
says that the law granting an extension

DECLARES SON
IS LOVE-MAD
When Jlother Summons Po
lice Boy Tries to " End
Misery by 'Taking Opium
Though only 19 years old, George C.
Crosman has once been married and di
vorced, and, now he loves another girl,
a- sweet nurse, unto mad desperation.
With stern, cold hand his mother has
tried to curb his reckless romancing. But
her efforts were of no avail. Yesterday
she appealed to the police to come and
arrest her son on a charge of Insanity,
and while she was at the telephone giv
ing the message the heart-sore swain at
tempted to depart this miserable world
by taking a dose of opium. A stomach
pump at- the Central Emergency Hospital
cheated tragedy and the boy was left to
toss on a narrow couch, contemplating
the cruelties of his existence and moan
ing his complaints against a heartless
mother. Â»
The mother is Mrs. M. E. Day. who
conducts an employment bureau at 456
O'Farrell street. The pretty nurse in the
case is Miss Martha â¢ Fowler. Some
months ago she cared for young Crosman
while he was ill at a local sanitarium,
and then and there their romance began.
