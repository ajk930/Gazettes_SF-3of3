below Chiutiencheng. The Jap
anese batteries replied to this shell
ing and silenced the Russian fire.

The general staff has issued the fol
. lowing account of the fighting on the
Yalu. River on Friday and Saturday:
"From General Kuropatkin's tele
grlirr.s 'it appears that the Japanese,
haviajr crossed to the right bank of the
Yalur"near the village of Sindiagu, oc
oykpied' the villages of Khussan and
'irftzaven. General Sassulitch sent a
' 3etachin*nt. commanded by staff Lieu
tenant .Colonel Lind to attack the
enemy. *-
â¢ ST. PETERSBURG. May 2.â The flrs^
Japanese array, under General Kurokl,'
â¢ consisting of the Guards and the Sec
ur.d and Twelfth Divisions, according
to ot!:c-!al and private advices from the
front, crossed the Yaiu 'yesterday about;
UiirtV riiies above the mouth of the;]
river, near Kiu'.iuntz, where the river, j
bends abruptly to the eastward. For

On Saturday a gunboat flotilla at the
â¢ ir.oalh of the river and all the field
Â£ v;:s posted on the Korean bank

HEAVY RUSSIA* LOSSES.
XJD the morning of May 1 it became ap

evened again v.ith their batteries, pour
in 4 an intense lire into the Russian

. Iltve. thst it vas put out for the pur
â¢ jtose'f't acclaiming ihe crossing a great
Japanese victory where it cannot pos
â¢s;Lly warrant such a claim.
The Russians believe it will require
â¢a w^ek'to get General Kuroki's army
â¢ <jtr.f ktely across and ready to advance
â¢on the Peking road.
The fact that the Russians have re
irfated to positions Lack of Turenchen,
where there is more fighting, shows
that they have built intrenchments,
v.hich ihe Jai-anese are under the
necessity of taking before they can
â¢jjush 6h. consequently continuous fight
. in? and skirmishing will occur, the
plan of 'the Russians being to hang on
to .the flanks of the enemy and annoy
and. worry him to the uttermost. Noth
ing -really decisive, however, is expect-
Vd until the Japanese advance shall en
ccunter the Russian position in the
mountain passes. It is even considered
that the Japanese may be able to turn
the Russian position there, but all this
is rro.vided for in General Kuropatkln's
flans.
GENERAL STAFF'S REPORT.
The general staff account of Sunday's
opera'tiens on the Yalu River is as fol
iows:
'"At 4 o'clock this morning Japanese
field bafterie* and forty-*Â»even guns
opened "a terrific nre on our position at
Turenchen and un our troops posted
Xtesf PotJetentiky.
"The overwhelming superiority of the
jÂ£pÂ£.nese in artillery and the heavy
losses their fire inflicted on our troops
occupying these jmsitlons made it clear
to Gerferal Sassulitch that it was im
possible to hold Turenchen. Conse
quently the troops were ordered to re
tiro. from Turenchen. while still hold
ing the Potietensky road.
"When General Sassulitch dispatched
his telegram the Russian troops were
retiiir-i? in pood order from Turenchen
and Sohakhedzky to their second posi
tion snd the- battle was continuing at
Potieter.sky and Tchingu."
"I hope that the combined efforts of
the navy and army, the latter under
the guidance oftSkobolefTs right hand,
will vanquish rhe foe, to. the glory of
the Emperor and of Russia."
Vice Admiral Skrydloff has tele
graphed General Kuropatkin as fol
lows:
The regulations prescribing* the acts
for which the decoration of the Order
of St." GeOrge shall be conferred will be
amended so as to meet the conditions
of modern warfare. Under the new
amendments the entire crew of a tor
pedo-boat sinking an enemy's vessel
will be entitled to a ribbon of the or
der.
General Trepnff has been appointed
to command the medical department
of the Manchurian army. He will have
general direction of the operations of
the Red Cross Society at the seat of
war.
"Our losses in men have not yet been
definitely ascertained, but up to the
present H is only known that three
were killed and nineteen wounded."
"Our losses at the Tu'renchen pontoon
were Lieutenant Pakhaloff killed and
Lieutenant Colonel Mahler, command
ing *Â« battery of the Sixth Artillery
Brigade, seriously wounded in the
head; Colonel ' Mester, Captain Voro
boeff. Captain Sapojnikoff, Lieutenant
Philadelphoff and Captain Atroschenko
wounded. Lieutenant Rutporoff of the
Twenty-second Regiment was seriously
wounded in the head on the pontoon
near Khussan.
> and Khuss&n retreated, partly to the
Yalu and partly northward.
"At 10 o'clock on the morning of April
23 a Japanese force of 1500 infantry,
with twelve guns, began to cross the
river near Arabikhe and Schogapoudzy.
NVar Ambikhe there was a small Rus
sian detachment under Lieutenant Col
onel Goussev, which was compelled to
retire under the sustained fire of two
Japanese batteries of six guns each.
Fuuk men were wounded.
"General Mishtchenko reports that
Japanese warships at th* mouth of the
Yalu on April 29 opened fire on our
trcops, the cannonade lasting for twen
ty minutes. No damage was done.
"On April 30. from 10 o'clock in the
mcrning until 5 o'clock in the after
noon, the Japanese shelled our position
at Turenchen from their batteries on
the left bank, where they had posted
twenty-four field guns and twelve 120
miUmetre siege guns, which were clev
erly mounted on masked earthworks.
They fired a minimum of 2000 projec
tiles. Our troops stuck stubbornly to
the pontoon at Turenchen.
"On the ir.ornfnfr of April 30 the Jap
anese recrossed the Yalu at Sindiagu,
attacking our troops posted on the
heights near the village of Khussan
and turned our left flank. Owing to the
great superiority of the Japanese troops
we retreated to a position near the vil
lage of Potieteneky.
EXTENT OF CASCAI/riES.
The Times military correspondent,
presuming that other important Jap
anese operations will coincide with the
Kiutiencheng affair, points out that
the world is completely -in the dark
regarding the second and third Jap
anese armies. The second, army left
Japan in the latter part' of March, un
der General Â¦ Oku, .. correspondent
says, and so far no 9'ne has been able,
to locate it. /
"It has vanished 'Into space," says
the" correspondent, who also ji points
out that the third army embarked
quite recently.
A dispatch from Mukden Rays that
General Kuropatkin arrived there yes
terday (Sunday) morning and left in
the afternoon. His destination Is not
stated.
The news of the very serious losses
suffered by both Bides arrived too late
to appear in the London morning pa
pers and these losses are not yet men
tioned in dispatches from Russian
sources. - â¢ â¢ ' ..
"The fight.", the ' editorial says,
"must modify, and forever, the des
tinies of Europe and Asia."
The Daily Mail's Newchwang cor
respondent hears that the Russians
are accumulating great quantities of
stores at Tieling, forty miles north of
Mukden, as their principal base of
supplies.
LONDON, May 2.â The accounts of
the fighting on the Yalu River have
reached London and, various opinions
are expressed this morning regarding
the importance of the Japanese vie?
tory. It is considered in some quar
ters that if was never the intention
of the Russians to hold the right bank
of the Yalu, except for tactical pur
poses, and that the real struggle has
not yet been reached. All of the
papers, however, recognize that the
success" of the Japanese will greatly
enhance their prestige.
The Daily Telegraph, in an editorial,
takes the rather extreme view of coin*
paring the capture, of Klutiencheng to
that of Waterloo and Plevna and says
that the present misfortune is even
more serious, because the Russians
have been driven from a fortified posi
tion in spite of every advantage con
ferred on its defense by modern
weapons. -, Â¦
Russians Have Not Yet .Made Their
Decisive Stand.
RKAL BATTLrE TO COMB.
The Japanese, knowing'that the Rus
sians would intercept " wireless â¢ mes
sages, tried a neat trick to deceive and
worry Viceroy Alexieff. For several
nights in. succession they sent by wire
less telegraph orders to prepare for a
landing. Jo send In flreshlps. to attack
with submarine boats, etc.
PORT ARTHUR. May 1.â Details of
the demonstration off Port Arthur un
April 27 disclose the ingÂ§nuity of the
Japanese, i Their squadron set afloat
a string of connected rafts carrying
burning matter. About 1:40 o'clock in
the morning, when five miles oft shore,;
the combustibles were fired, the wind
and waves bringing the burning floats
toward the harbor.
Under cover of this screen of fire
eight Japanese torpedo boats,' towing
a launch filled with mines, slipped
arcund to a spot near where " the Pet
ropavlovsk was sunk, but they, were
detected by Russian searchlights. The
batteries opened fire 'and drove them
off, but not before the mines had been
planted. The mines have since been
destroyed. . ,.-.:Â«,
enemy which he intercepted the ad
miral found that he was surrounded
by Japanese warships, but owing to
a dense fog he was able to slip into
Vladivostok unnoticed.
TOKIO, Mav 1. â The latest Jap
anese naval movements against Vlad
ivostok failed of success because of
the dense fogs which prevailed in the
vicinity of that port.

General Manager Chapman said late
last night that nothing would be forth

A formal statement was Issued last
night by the carmen's organization, as
follows:
Ean Francisco. Cal.. May 1. 190*.â On. the
adjournment of our meeting last evening we
sent a comintinicatlon to the United Railroads
Company, informing them that Mayor Schmitz
had appeared at our meeting and appealed to
our organization In the name of the citizens of
Fan Francisco, urging us to defer action for
three days, in order to Rive him an opportunity
to ohÂ« his good office* to bring about a settle
ment between our organisation and the com
pany. He assured us that he would I see that
Justice would be done and a*, satlefactory
agreement reached; If not, his friendship and
assistance would be v. itli us. In, accordance
with these requests and promises our organ
lzatlon voted to grant the three, days.
On delivering the information to tha , com
pany, they replied that the proposition was all
right. With this understanding we are pa
tiently waiting the action of the Mayor.
in the evening word reached them
from an outside source of the nature
of the necotiations between Mayor
Schmitz and the oftiials of the United
I Railroads. Plainly they were irritated.
i but would give no spoken sign of it.
\ President Mahon said he was per
fectly willing to go Into conference
: again over the troubles. "We have
1 nothing to conceal in this contention,"
he said. "We have broken our by
laws in order that the public of San
might have every available
Â¦ point of view of the situation, in the
| hope that it will recognize the Just
! ness of our contention. The members
j of our organization voted to delay ac
j tion for three days, at the request of

! interest of industrial j>eace. During
j that period "we shall take "no action.
! I will remain in San Francisco until

CARMEN'S STATEMENT.
ST. LOUIS, May 1.â The first Sunday
of the World's Fair found the gates
tightly closed to the thousands* of peo
ple who thronged Forest Park to-day.
However, notwithstanding that the
public was barred, there were a few
more favored who were permitted to
enjoy the exposition grounds to-day.
They were Secretary Taft, Governor
Herrick of Ohio, ' Exposition officials
and the members of the Congressional
delegation who attended the opening,
and members of the Pennsylvania State
Commission, who will to-morrow dedi
cate the Keystone State building.
This party filled a line of carriages
which, conducted by Secretary Stevens
of the Exposition, traversed the main
avenues of the grounds, visiting the
Government" building, after which
luncheon was served at the Inside Inn.
Later a tour of the Pike was made.
Whije work Was generally suspended
throughout the grounds, in the differ
ent exhibit buildings individual exhi
bitors were busily employed to-day
making every effort to hasten the com
pletion of the exhibitions.
The ferry sfeamer had been carrying
crowds a.11 day from the foot of Valen
tine street outjnto midstream past the
Nashville and back again. No stop was
made at the Nashville. As the ferry
boat was rounding the Nashville and
starting back to the dock the crowd
on the upper deck rushed to the stairs
side and out upon the hurricane rooT.
The strain was too great and the roof
collapsed, precipitating a large number
to the, deck below. Instantly a panic
ensued. .A danger signal was blown
and tugs hurried. alongside, but it was
thought best to proceed to land rather
than attempt to place the injured on
the tugs. s Ambulances had been called
and soon . aferward - the Alonzo reached
shore. The injured were taken to the
city hospital or to their homes.
An unidentified woman was seriously
Injured. Seventeen others, all residents

Lemon defied the people to prevent
the wedding. He hired the opera-house
and issued personal invitations to all
the leading citizens to be present, be
sides announcing that the whole town
might come to see him wed. The hall
was packed with spectators, and after
Justice W. D. Kidd had performed the
ceremoney the groom stepped to the
front of the stage and proceeded to tell
the people what he thought of them.
He indulged in sarcastic and embit
tered invective against his enemies.
His most biting sarcasm was directed
against a well-known widow of Akron,
and although he- mentioned no name
every one of the audience knew to
whom he referred.
The pastor told the people that it was
his business and not theirs whom he
married, and defied them to Interfere In
any way with him or his bride.
Several speakers arose and denounced
the preacher and threa'ts_of a lynching
and of tar and feathers were uttered,
but the minister held his own and no
violence was offered.
As the bride and groom left the
opera-house they were serenaded by a
gang of boys and. continued to be the
center of attraction until they left
town in the evening. Accompanied by
the young bride's mother, who has
raised no objection to the marriage,
the newly married pair drove away,
toward night to visit with relatives of
the bride in a neighboring town.
AKRON, Iowa. May 1.â Rev. J. C.

of the Christian missionary.
. -When Bishop Warne concluded Chan
rpllor James R_ Day of Syracuse, N. Y..
vas introduced by Bishop Andrews and
delivered a thoughtful address on "My
Personal Responsibility."
First Chancellor Day paid high honor
to the "venerable gentleman who sat by
his, side, John Flinn, who in his
â¢eighty-seventh year presented the ap
p*=arance of a hale and hearty man.
Tlie chancellor spoke of the marvel
ous changes since he first heard John
,F!ina preach, at the period of the
snraker's youth. The changes that had
come in national life were described.
cjnd from that the chancellor reminded
his hearers of their responsibility,
Â¦which stretched far beyond the sea,
tÂ£at embraces those who know not God,
< ivilization or those opportunities and
benefits which have come to other peo
ples.
Â«vian without responsibility, he said,
is a nJere animal, and he declared it is
responsibility f,hat makes men and re
sponsibility that rears nations out of
a humble beginning.
He described Borneo and the wild
man of Borneo and the efforts to Chris
tianize him. Churches are there, and
God's blessing, said the Bishop, has
been ehed on the labor of the mission
ary in that field.
â¢Bishop Warne told of the work that
is yet to be done In India, in Burmah
aad in ether centers, ar.d spoke of the
varjing conditions to be found among
the." pagans, and how they wait to re
<eive'the gospel and how receptive they
arf when the Bible is taken them.
There is magnincent work being done
out In those lands by the missionary,
eaid the Bishop, and there are churches
and schoolhouses. and the heathen re
sponds to the teachings.
"All People That on Earth Do Dwell,"
and the Rev. YÂ»\ H. Crawford, presi
dent of Allegheny College, read a scrip
tural jpassagc, and a prayer was deliv
ered by Dr. D. Thirklied of Cincinnati.
" Bishop Andrews then spoke of the
completion of the work of the conven
tion, which had not only spread good
seed, .but had aroused the church In no
ordinary degree to its responsibility to
the missionary field.
'Then Bishc^ Warne of India deliv
ered an addross in place of Bishop
Warren, who has not yet arrived from
the o'rient. He will join the conference
in Los Angeles this week.
The great missionary convention,
â¢which has been In session at the Al
hambra Theater, closed yesterday alt
'ernoon with an inspiring religious ser
."vlce." The .building was packed with
liien and women, representing all walks
of life, from all parts of the world.
The venerable Bishop Andrews of
New 'York City presided, and on either
tide cf him were other notables of the
Methodist Episcopal church.

The officials of the union waited all
day for soiru- message from the Mayor
regarding his stand and what develop
ments could be expected. At 5 o'clock
UNION OFFICIALS WAIT.
The Mayor refused to give out the
nature of the message he sent over
the telephone to Tirey L. Ford and
the latter was equally reticent. Pres
ident Holland pleaded illness for re
fusing an interview and General Man
ager Chapman said he was ignorant
of the nature of the message of the
Mayor. From other sources it was
learned that the city's executive asked
for another conference between the
representative.*! of the union and the
offlials of the railway company, at
which he could be present and listen
to the f-xplanatlons of the stand both
sides are taking. If there should be
any chance of agreement. Mayor
Sehmitz promised to use his utmost
efforts to effect a. settlement of the
troubles.
General Manager Chapman, who re
mained at the company's headquar
ters all Saturday night and yesterday,
slated yesterday that so far as he
knew Mayor Schmitz had held no
communication with the officials of
the company until yesterday morning
at 11 o'clock.
Mahon did not find Schmitz, because
the Mayor had gone home twenty min
utes before. Neither was there any
conference between Schmitz and the
officiate of the United Railroads while
the meeting was in progress nor when
the union meeting received a tele
phone message from him. A. Ruef,
the attorney, wandered up Market
street at 3 o'clock in the morning and
was asked if he knew where the
Mayor could be found. He answered
that Schmitz was probably at home,
as he had left him half an hour before
with that understanding.
MAYOR WENT HOME.
General Manager Chapman of the
United Railroads stated last night that
ho far as he kn^vv there was absolutely
no change in the stand of the company
and no hope of one. International
President Mahon and Richard Cornel
ius were equally positive that there
had been no change in the attitude of
the members of the union regarding its
recognition. They stated that the three
days' respite from a strike was granted
by the members of the union entirely
because it had been requested by 'the
Mayor in the name of the citizens of
San Francisco. No alteration, they
think, has come to the minds of the
men to the original stand they
took when they voted to reject the
terms of the company.
Under all the reserve that hedges
about the matter of the existing
troubles between the carmen and the
United Railroads there is an apparent
resentment against Mayor Schmitz
among the union officials for deferring
his kindly offices of adjustment until
the eleventh hour. When the union
meeting at the Alhambra was adjourn
ed yesterday morning International
President Mahon disregarded the steps
from the platform and jumped oft the
stage with the alacrity of an acrobat.
He hurried up a side aisle and when
asked where he was going he said:
"I'm looking for Schmitz."
"Where do you expect to find him?"
he was asked.
"I don't know," he responded, "but
I want to find out the grounds upon
which he based his statement that
there was a possibility of the com
pany accedirig to the terms of the
union."
Not one step in the way of reconcili
ation was effected yesterday. Mayor
Schmitz got into communication at 11
o'clock in the morning* with Tirey L.
Ford, head of the legal department of
the United Railroads and formerly At
torney General of California. To him
the Mayor, over the telephone, stated
that in the interest of the peace ofthe
city and the convenience of the public
he desired to arrange another confer
ence between the officials of the United
Railroads and the representatives of
the union. Mr. Ford promised to con
vey the Mayor's request to President
Holland of the United Railroads and,
did so. When the latter received it he
left the Rialto building, where the
company's headquarters are located,
and went to his residence.
COMPANY SAYS NO CHANGE.
Mayor Schmits has taken the helm
from the officials of the Street Car
men's Union in an endeavor to steer
clear through the shallows and reefs
of the impending: trouble between the
United Railroads and its employes. So
far as he has proceeded nothing has
been accomplished.
When Mayor Schmitz made the prop
osition at an early hour yesterday
morning- for a three days' postpone

"Paradise and the Peri" Is taken
from Moore's "Lalla Rookh" and tells
the story of a peri seeking to regain
admission to heaven. She offers three
gifts before she finally finds one that
is "most dear to heaven," which is
the repentant tear of a sinner, wrung
from him by the prayer of an Inno
cent child. The oratorio, with Moore's
words, was written in 1843 by'Srhu
mann, but it has been seldom sung,
though -considered one of the great
composer's masterpieces.
The half-hour of music in the Greek
Theater next Sunday afternoon will
take the form of a sacred concert,
given for the benefit of the Students*
Club house loan . fund. A fee of 25
cents will be charged and the re
ceipts will form the nucleus for- a
large loan fund, which will be aided
by subsequent concerts in the theater.
This sacred concert will be the first
step toward the realization of a plan
proposed several months ago to en
dow a fund which should aid clubs
of students at the university in prop
erly furnishing their clubhouses. The
plans are in charge of a committee of
the faculty and alumni appointed by
President Wheeler last January. The
members of the committee are Dr.
Marj' B. Ritter, Colonel George C. Ed
wards, Mrs. May L. Cheney, Dr.
Charles H. Rieber and Warren
Olney Jr.
Five thousand people sat in the
Greek Open-air Theater at the Uni
versity of California this afternoon
listened to the singing of Schumann's
romantic oratorio, "Paradise and the
Peri." by a chorus of mixed voices,
led by the Baroness von Meyerinck of
San Francisco. It was an ideal May
day. just temperate 'enough to make it
comfortable for the thousands ranged
upon the tiers of the theater and the
charm of it all was enhanced by the
blending of thirty voices in the beau
tiful oratorio.

At the morning service many attend

united with the fellowship of the First

dollars was also added to the new
church fund, which now amounts to
more than $25,000.
To-morrow the work of demolishing
the old church building will begin. De
lanoy & Randlett of this city, who have
the contract to erect the new edifice,
expect to have the Sunday-school and
assembly hyJl of the proposed building
completed by August 1. They plan to
have the entire building ready for oc
cupancy by Thanksgiving day'if possi

meantime the congregation will wor
ship at the usual morning hour in. the
Unitarian Church. The evening ser
vices .will be held at the homes of the

I believe that there if a grand future for

heart* are large, but your courage and daring
must be equal to that large-heartedness if
we are going to accomplish God's will con
cerning us. We have a grand purpose before
ui â and now we xsust move forward, ae well
as look forward. - A few years ago I stood

But that Ic not the way to take tb!s prom

rot enough that Tre capture it with our im

and wishes; we must rut off lndlfferer.ee anl

Then followed a graphic picture of
Moses' journey up Nebo. the pastor
drawing the lesson that the peace and
the joy of the closing hours of life de
pend largely upon the u?e to which this
life has been put. and he reminded his
people that here and now they were
furnishing the theme for the swan-song
of life. From this point Mr. Hitchcock
gave a short sketch of the past history
of the church under the figure of
Moses" backward look from the summit
of Pisgah. And then, with the color
ing of his forward look out over the
promised land, he portrayed the future
of the church in its new venture. Con
tinuing Mr. Hitchcock said:
GREAT FUTURE ASSURED.
Nearly all the great and uplifting events of

ALAMEDA, May 1.â "Good-by" was
said by the members of the First Con
gregational Church to-night to the old
religious home in which some of them
had worshiped for nearly twenty-five
years. It was the last service held in
the ancient structure and was made
memorable by the presence of the first
pastor 'of the church, the Rev. George
Morris, who organized the congregation
a quarter of a century ago in a hay
loft at the West End. Rev. L. Potter
Hitchcock, the pastor of the First Con
gregational Church, delivered the fare
well sermon, his topic being "Look For
wardâMove Forward." In part he said:
Charles N. Fox came to California in
1S5S. having been admitted to the bar

mission as Justice of the Supreme
Court of the State from Governor
Waterman, being appointed to fill out
the unexpired term of Jackson Temple,
who had resigned.
Judge Fox was a prominent member
of the Odd Fellows of California and
served as a member and as president
of the Board of Education of Oakland.
Charles N. Fox. formerly- Justice of

Seniors of the University of Califor

between, rehearsing for the extrava
ganza that'is to be given on Class day
and the final examinations. Some of
them may not pass the "exes." but
they purpose to do their parts well in
the extravaganza. The character of
the Â»extravaÂ§anza and its name are
still somewhat of a mystery, though it
is understood to be something like its
predecessors in that it is a travesty on
university life and the lives of some
of the faculty. .It' is to be given about
the middle of the month, the date not
yet havinsr been set. There will be a

Dr. Baker then pronounced the ben
diction and the last meeting of the
members in their old home was ended.
The Younc Men's Christian Association
moves to-day, and now it is up to the people
of Oakland to make the â¢ ne-xt move. They
must decide whether the work of the organi
zrticn shall end here or shall be carried on.
They must make a choice now and it is for
them to spell for the association the word suc
cess or the word: failure.
Brief addresses were made by the
Rev. Charles T. Walkley. the Rev. H.
J. Vosburgh and Rabbi Friedlander,
and the meeting closed with a short
talk by the Rev. E. E. Baker, who said:
We have met not -to bury Caesar, but to
rrai*e him and to bid him Codsjwed on hi*
way to secure a new suit of clothes. When a
small boy emerses from kilts the occasion is
not made one of mourning, and when he dis
cards the knee cants for long trcn*ers he
generally has still further cause for rejoicing.
And that is Just the condition of this associa
tion. It has discarded the kilts and the knee
ftant* and now that it is about to don the long
trousers why should we express any regret?
In times past this organization has stood for
three things: First, for enlarged social op
portunities for younsr men; second, for In
stitutional Christianity, and third, for co
operation between the various religious bodies
of Oakland.
"Forward is now . otfr watchword."
was the sentiment expressed by Frank
Fowler, and after a song by the double
quartet the Rev. Charles R. Brown said
in part:
The time has coire for us to bid farewell
to this old building, which baa been our home
for exactly fourteen years. Since lie have
been located here we have seen our association
grow from a mere handful to a membership of
nearly 7w. Tte aDZ>earance of this hall U
%'erj* different to-Cay from what it was four
teen years ago. when we met here to dedicate
this building, but though the sills to-dar are
bare, there should be no regret at leaving our
old home, for in dclne Â»o we take one more
step toward higher an.l better things. We
nhall enter a larger building and one far better
equipped for th<? work of this association.
.A. L. Adams of the board of directors
said:
The Young 3J>n's Christian Association does
not consist of bricks and mortar, and we
should not feel that the work of this organiza
tion ends when we leave this building, but
rather that it is one Btep more toward eternaj
freedom. Any person who has the cowl of
voting men at heart should aid us in our work
for a cew - T. M. C. A. building. . .
After the invocation, delivered by the
Rev. Charles R. Brown. D. Edward
Collins, president of the association,
gave a short Bible reading, after which
he said, in part:
The programme prepared for the
farewell meeting was 'brief, consisting
of music by the association orchestra,
vocal selections by a double quartet
under the direction of E. D. Crandall.
and short addresses by the president
and several members of the associa
tion and the pastors of several of the
churches.
Fourteen years ago to-day the old
home of the Young Men's Christian
Association was dedicated to the use
for which it had been erected, and the
"farewell meeting this afternoon was
opened with the singing of the hymn
which was sung at the opening of th
dedicatory exercises, which were held
in the same auditorium which was
used 'this afternoon.
The members of the Young Men's
Christian Association of this city bade
farewell thia afternoon to the building
at Twelfth and Clay streets, which for
fourteen years has been the home of
the association and where the institu
tion has grown from a mere handfull
of earnest workers to a membership
of nearly seven hundred. Â¦ Although
many pleasant recollections are asso
ciated with the building vacated to
day, there were no expressions of re
gret at the farewell meeting, for as
several of the speakers pointed out.
the abandonment of the building,
which had become inadequate to the

ALANIEDA COUNTYAlfred Rix, one of the oldest lawyers
in the city and a Judge of the Police
Court during the early 'days of San
Francisco, died at 10 o'clock yesterday
morning at his home, 743 Pine street.
He was the contemporary of many
famous leaders of the local bar, includ
ing such men as Hall McAllister, John
B. Felton, Delos Lake and others of
the same era and rank.
Mr. Rix was born at the village of
Stanstead, in Canada East, on April .7.
1821, and had therefore passed his
eighty-third birthday. At the age of 6
years he removed with his family to
New Hampshire, where they resided
until he was 18, when another removal
carried them to Peacham. Vt. About
this time the vouth entered the Univer
sity of Vermont, from which he was
graduated in 1846. For two . years he
acted as principal of the school at
Peacham. In 1849 he began the prac
tice of law in rultnershlp with the son
of the Governor. of Vermont. s
COMES TO CALIFORNIA. \
In 1851,;having, like many otheram
bitious young men, caught the Califor
nia fever, Rix came West and mined
for a year on the North Fork of the
American River. The following year,
how-ever, : found him in San Francisco
teaching in the public schools and pre
paring for the practice of his profes
sion. At one time he was a Justice of
the Peace, and in 1866 he was appointed
by the Governor of the State to fill an j
unexpired term as Police Judge. With/
the exceptionsof these periods >in judi
cial office hi3 life was given up to an
exceedingly active and lucrative prac
tice until his retirement, which oc
curred some fifteen years ago.
The decedent was a man of practical
mind, and this trait led him into patent
law as his favorite vocation. Among
the famous cases with which he was
connected was the litigation; over .the
Nobel dynamite patent. He had drawn
the original patent on which' Nobel
built up his vast industry, that now
has its factories in nearly every Euro
pean, country, and under which high
explosives were manufactured in the
United States.;
I ATTORNEY FOR NOBEL.
The litigation over this patent.occu
pied Judge Rix for years, in the courts
both of the .United States and Europe.
He was also general counsel for - the
Atlantic Dynamite and Giant "Powder
Company, as well, as for many other
corporations.. His practical bent ; led
him to interest himself In the problem
of cable railways in San Francisco,
and the solution of this question was
worked'out. with his professional aid.
Judge Rix was married twice, ' but
survived his : second wife, who
was Â¦-'â¢; Miss Margaret Tulte,- who
died in 1S94. He leaves four sons-
Julian Rix. the well-known artist; ? Ed
ward A. Rix, the mechanical engineer;
William Rix of. the legal firm of Bish
op, Wheeler & Hoefler, and'AlfredShir
ley Rix of San Jose. The funeral | ser
vices, which wijl be held at 2 o'clock

deceased, will :be private. In accord

at* the boards. Now, in our work-a-day
Â¦ world breakfasts are mere matutinal

cf this city, your pardon! I took the
unwarranted liberty last Monday of
awarding to the last mentioned body
The local council, made up of thir
ty-nine of the women's clubs in and
around San Francisco, has taken up
this subject in earnest and hopes to
see a public awakening which w^ll
mean the strong practical facing of
the situation.
Under such conditions the folly of
a city putting padlocks on the gates
of her sdhool playyard during the
hours that children play (as is done
in San. Francisco) is manifest.
The decreasing number of working
hours among the laboring classes is
leaving them with a leisure that must
be filled pleasantly and usefully or it
will be filled with things undesirable,
evil and menacing to the social se
curity. Under such conditions the
folly of a city locking up and refus
ing the public use of assembly rooms,
lecture halls, rooms which might be
used for instructing and entertaining
lactures and social gatherings is mani
fest. .
A "committee was appointed, with
Miss Lillian Bridgman of the Associa
tion of Collegiate Alumnae as chair
man. Miss Bridgman prepared a
scheme of investigation and called upon
the clubs belonging to the council fot
workers. Twenty-four clubs responded,
sending in forty-two workers. This
large committee was divided 'into ten
sub-committees, each being given its
particular Hne for investigation. The
splendid, enthusiastic work of this com
mittee has been a delight, a satisfaction
and a revelation to all interested in its
activity. Fifty of San Francisco's pub
lic schools have been visited and inves
tigated with a view to ascertaining
their present condition and suitability
for an enlarged use. The night schools,
the branch libraries and call stations,
the parks and squares and playgrounds,
the kindergartens, the social settle
ments, e_tc, have been visited and in
vestigated.
An exhaustive study of the all-im
portant subject of funds and legislative
provisions has been made: costs of
equipping gymnasia, playgrounds, etc..
have been secured, and conditions in
other cities and counties have been
sought. The work of the committee
represents a large amount of valuable
data on this new subject of the greater
use of our public schools and of the
municipal plant generally. -
Slowly the American municipalities
are awakening to the fact that greater
responsibilities for the material
and moral "well being of the citi
zen rests upon them, and that to
meet these i responsibilities a more
economic use of resources must be
made. The growth of our large cities
has brought new demands which
must be met by Â¦ new arrangements.
This is becoming true not only of the
poorer portions of the cities, but of
others "as well. The increasing ten
dency of the comfortably well-to-do
to live in flats and apartments is fast
leaving the children of the city no
place to play â to grow up in..
The local Council of Women of San
Francisco and viclnitv has had a win
ter of most interesting work. At the
beginning of the year the subject of the
socialization of the public schools and
the establishment of municipal social
centers was taken up for study and in
vestigation.

as follows: ; !- -

the officers of the aforementioned club.
Now, distinctly, no libel was done, be
cause a better set of officers could not
have been found in all clubdom, but I
dare say the Clionian Club prefers the
officers of its own choosing, which, by
the way, manifests a most excellent
discrimination. Likewise does the
Adelphian Club dislike to â¢ part with
any honor, however slight, that is re
flected upon its clever president, Mrs.
Hattie Chapman, the woman â who â
doesâ things.

The destruction of the palace of the
Emperor of Korea leaves the ruler of
the Hermit Kingdom in a peculiar sit

each with large grounds. Those which
were unoccupied at the* time of the
fire had been deserted because of the
superstitious fear of the Emperor to
remain where there had been death by
violence. He forsook the first because
of the killing of a favorite, and, a few
years ago.\the second, because of the
murder of his Queen. Unless he re

he will be without a home.

HORSEPOWER â Subscriber, San
Lorenzo, CaL A forty horsepower en
gine has "the same power, whether at
tached to an automobile or Is station
ary." The term horsepower is one in
mechanics used In expressing the force
of a motive power. It is based on the
assumption that horses In general per
form a certain constant amount of
work in a specified timeâ an assump
tion evidently erroneous. The funda
mental unit of work Is the foot pound;
but in measuring the work of a horse
by this unit the estimates of the most
celebrated engineers differ widely from
each other: Boulton and Watt, basing
their calculation on the work of Lon
don dray horses, working eight hours
per day, estimated it at' 32.000 foot
pounds Â« per minute. D'Aubulsson,
taking the work done by horses In
whims at Friedberg, estimated the
work, eight hours per day, at 18,440 foot
pounds. Under similar circumstances
the estimates of Desaguller was 44,000:
Smeaton. 22,000, and Tregold, 27.500. It
matters little, however, what number
is assumed, provided the same be al
ways used. Accordingly, the original
estimate by Watt la still counted a
horsepower." _
Above the hills to the east

And gallops them out to sea.
I â The Youth's Companion.
Then all night longv- till dawn.
The maddened seas race in.
Back in the fields of cane
The beaten spray drifts thin.
She shouts from the boiling reef
And the black rocks surge and dip.
Under the eaves of our house _
We hear the lash of her whip.
Mad. at the touch of -her hand
They race, and rear at the bit;
Arching their necks of black;
Tossing their, manes alit.
They rush at the sunken reefs-
Urged by her bitter hand.
They trample the steady rocks
And die on the flinching sand.
All day in the quiet, sun
And the draught of an easy breeze
We watch the creaming surf
And fiark, to the singing trees;
But as soon as the windows gleam.
And the piping crickets begin.
The wind of the night awakes
And gallops the breakers in.
White is her face and fair;
Her hands are like palest shells;
Her house is the racing scud;
H%r bed where the petrel dwells.
All day she sleeps and dreams
With her cheek in her idle hand,
But as soon as the stars are lit
She gallops the waves to land.
Catching their manes of foam
She gallops the breakers in.
Beyond the surf and the reef;
Beyond the gloom and the stars;
Shifting the purple veils,
And swinging the dream-time bars.
The wind of the night awakes
In those fenceless acres of din

ICEâ M. S. R., San Rafael. Cal. Water
on becoming solid, or ice, expands
about one-ninth of its volume, or bulk.
The formation of Ice takes place gen
erally^at the surface of water. This is
owing to the peculiarity that when
water has cooled down to within 7.4
degrees of freezing it ceases to con
tract, as* before, with Increase of cold,
and begins to expand until it freezes,
which causes the coldest portions of
the water to be always floatint on the

At the present time the sandalwood
tree, once so plentiful, is fast disap
pearing, and there Is little to remind
one that sandalvyood once grew on
every hill and clustered in every. val
ley of Erromango.
The ships carried' great lengths of
hoop-iron bound together. Amid the
babble of voices from swarms of naked,
painted savages clamoring for their
pay. and the confusion and shoutings
that arose as the huge logs were swung
Jnto place, there could be heard the
click of the hammer as It struck the
anvil; the iron was being cut into the
coveted lengths.
After the logs were burned and cut
down, they were carried to the bay
on men's shoulders. The biggest logs
had to be dragged down the rocky
mountain tracks. *
Netai, the great chief Netai of Cooks
Bay, used to delight to tell me of the
olden times on Erromango, and how
slow were' the methods of cutting
trees for their houses and canoes.
Every tree had to be burned at the
base, and when that was done there
still remained the slow work of hack
ing with stone axes to sever it from
the stump. Such was the early Erro
mangan method of hewing wood, and
the sandalwood had to be cut in this
way.
Erromango is one of the larger is
lands of the New Hebrides, from which
were formerly brought large quanti
ties of sandalwood. The carelessness
of the natives in protecting the for
ests reduced the product, until now
there is very little '"valuable wood on
the island. Rev. H. A. Robertson in
"Erromango, the Martyr Isle," gives a
brief history of the sandalwood trade.
The Erromangans for generations
used the sandalwood as they would any
other, for fuel, and had no idea of its
value until foreigners came and asked
for it. The only price that was at first
given was a small bit of hoop-Iron,
from three to four inches in length,
and this for a great boatload of wood.
The savages were greatly taken with
the iron, for by sharpening it on a
stone and fastening it to a piece of
wood they made themselves rough,
light hatchets. Before that they had
nothing but their ancient implements
of stone with which to work.

Another step in the direction of
technical education has been made in

by the Locomotive Drivers' Association

City Council in the scheme, as well as
the directors of the technical school
and the administration of the Royal
State Railroads. The school is for ap

BY the decision of the Carmen's Union at the Al

before them the public is given a three days' truce
in the controversy and another opportunity for negotia
tions toward a peaceful settlement that will free the city
of. the anxiety now felt over, the situation. It is to be
hoped that on both sides there will be developed during
these three days an earnest desire to come together upon
some common ground upon which both can stand con
tent and work in harmony throughout the year.
In the resolution postponing action .the carmen de
clare: "Division 205 does hereby agree to postpone final
action, as requested by the Mayor in the name of the
people of San Francisco, with the understanding that the
Mayor of the city in behalf of the people will use his
best efforts to secure an amicable and -honorable adjust
ment of .the controversy between the division and the
(Jnited Railroads."
Upon that showing it behooves all good citizens to
cordially support the Mayor in all that he may wisely
do toward bringing about the desired adjustment. The
Mayor has already done the city a service in obtaining
from the union consent to the three days' postponement.
For that he deserves credit and the credit should not end
with words. It should be made manifest to both the
contending parties that on this new phase of the is^sue
the people agree in insisting that if there be any ground
of mutual satisfaction between the parties that can be at
tained by conciliation and a due sense of responsibility
to the public, that ground shall be accepted by both sides
and San Francisco be freed from the danger of a strike
that will surely lead to disorder, the interruptipn of busi
ness, bitter strife and probably to bloodshed.
It is an old and familiar saying that if men could only
understand one another they would find that there exists
between fhem no valid cause for any strife whatever.
That truth has been recalled again and again by men
on both sides of even such a bitter strife as that of our
great Civil War, and veterans of the two armies have
often been heard to say with regret that all the blood- nd
treasure lost in the war might have been saved if only
the good men of the North and the good men of the
South could have met and learned^to know one another
and so reached a mutual understanding of the issues
over which the fire eaters and the agitators were hurry
ing the two sections to battle.
If that were true of the momentous issues of the
greatest strife our country has ever known, it is certainly
true of the lesser issue involved in this case. The de
sired thine; ai this juncture is to get at an understanding
on both sides. It is not an issue on which outsiders can
actively interfere without danger of complicating the
situation, but it is one in which the influence of public
opinion may well be exerted impartially in the interests
of peace. â¢
The three days' truce is a very valuable possession at
this time. -It gives one more chance for the voice of
reason to be heard. The carmen have done well in acting
upon the advice of the Mayor and there is now a reason
able hope that counsel? equally, good will direct them
to a decision that will put an end to all thought of strike
over the present controversy.
THREE DAYS' TRUCE.
"Mr. Jones is one of our leading
business men and a depositor of our
institution. He has been abroad for
several months, during which fre
quent reports have been received here
regarding reverses he has experienced.
The latest report received by us is to
the effect that he is now down to his
last four million dollars, but we have
entertained a hope that he will be
able to complete his journey through
the West on this sum without ex
treme embarrassment. Should he.
however, overdraw, our bank will
gladly meet his overdraft on prompt
advice from your management."
A conference between the manager
and the credit clerks of the St. Fran
cis resulted in Mr. Jones being placed
on the "O. K." list and he is still
staying at the hotel.
Cashing checks and drafts is a
practice that has grown to such mag
nitude in the local hotel business that
the managers of the big hostelrie3
have found it necessary to create a
banking system in connection with
their accounting departments. It is
frequently the case that some new ar
rival falls to properly identify him
self with Eastern business connec
tions upon which he desires to draw
for coin and is refused the accommo
dation which he earnestly need3.
There was a case of this sort at the
St. Francis several days ago, but the
guest accepted his predicament in a
philosophical manner and then re
marked to the cashier as he scribbled
several names and addresses on a
card:
"I expect to remain with you two
or three weeks and would like to en
joy the pleasure of your credit, so if
you will kindly wire to these people
I think my standing will be thorough
ly established."
Later in the^ day the hotel people
wired to the addresses in the East
and from one of them, that of a big
Boston banking firm, the following re
sponse came:

Several New York thieves, desperate to the point of
perfection, killed one of their own number recently while
experimenting with that deadly concoction known as

the programme Is carried out. At the

twice a day without any delay or fric
tion whatever. The acts included pret
ty much everything known to the saw
dust ring, in ad<Uttan to a Kiralfy
spectacle employing about 400 men and
women. Of course the most Important
part is the original assignment of all
these tusns, and the extraordinary part
of it all is that this is not done by gen
eral rehearsals, but on paper. Six
months before the circus opens Mr.
Bailey makes out a list of the number
and the kinds of turns he wants. Then
he sends his agents broadcast over tha
globe and collects them.
Every act is allowed seven minutes.

shown in the way they must occur so
that the interest of the audience may
always be kept up. Then many of th
artists appear in several turns. an<l
time must be given them to make the
proper changes of costume. The
clowns must be so placed as to appear
at their best, but not so as to interfere
with the ring or trapeze turns. Prop
erties must be brought out and put in
place for one act while the preceding
one is taking place, and the aerial acts
must be such as to attract the atten
tion of the audience from the prepara
tions which are going on below, and
vice versa. This is all arranged be
fore the first performance, and so
skilled has Mr. Bailey become In ar
ranging these details that he can tell
within ten minutes just how long a
performance will run. Like a "pro

ANTWERP. Aoril 20.â It is safe to
cay .that there is hardly one person in
ten in America who, if asked to name
the* great seaports of the world in their
relative order, would assign third place
- to Antwerp. But, measured by her
ocean-going traffic, that is where Ant
werp stands to-day, with London first
and New York second. And so rapidly
is her commerce growingâ 154 more
ships entered the port in 1903 than In
1932â that if New York does not dj
' some tall hustling, this Belgian town,
which contrasted with the metropolis
of the new world attracts little atten
tion, will certainly outstrip her. Ac
cording to the latest statistics avail

Antwerp's ocean tonnage amounts to
i6.721.000 tons; New York's to 17,338,000,
and London's to 17,504,000.
It is significant of the quiet way in

this phenomenal growth of Antwerp's;

years, has been accomplished without

HEADQUARTERS OP THE CALL,
'l HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT
GARDEN, LONDON, April It.â It Is
rather doubtful If what are after all
the funniest features of the so-called
"Sunday-echool Cigarettes" case which
has been exciting bo much hilarity In
this country hare been brought out in
the cabled acoounts of thÂ© affair. The
main facts probably are familiar. The
Rev. J. Lowman Lang, a. clergyman at
Woolington, In Somersetshire, sued the
' London Mall the other day and collect
ed $1250 because that newspaper re
ported that during the service In his
.Sabbath -school both cigarettes and cl
ears were given to the boys to stimu
, late their attendance, and this with
the parson's consent. As a matter of
â¢ fact, cigars and cigarettes were dealt
cut, though not during the Bervice, and
row it Is admitted that the youthful
attendance was stimulated considera
bly by the Innovation, but the clergy
man had no part in the business.
' Meanwhile, not satisfied with getting
over $1200 from the Mail, the reverend
gentleman has succeeded in prying $50
out of another paper that republished
the story. $100 out of a second and $125
out of a third. He says, however, that
he isn't so keen on gathering the coin
as a balm to his wounded feelings as
by way of compensation for tha
smount of bother the whole thing has
caused him.
They say a lie travels fast, but it is
safe betting that no half truth ever
Traveled so far as this one* did. The
tale of "cigarette bribery," as it was
' called, provoked amusement in New
Zealand, it caused a ripple of excite
ment in Ceylon, shocked some good
folk in the United States and made the.
churchprwrs of British Columbia raise
their hands in holy horror. And then
letters on the subject began pouring in
on the Rev. Mr. Lang from all parts
of -the world, not to mention this coun
try. Many of them jvere abusive, one
Â¦>Â¦ "writer telling the clergyman that he
â¢ deserved the contempt of all honest
men. A screed of protest reached him
from Chicago and tracts on the evils
t)'f smoking also were included in his
morning mail after the publication of
the "libel." He even found himself
aird his Sabbath-school cartooned in
Punch.
"It was done out of kindness â mis
taken kindness â by Mr. Wilmot," said
the reverend gentleman. He referred
Jo the dealing out of the cigarettes.
Mr. Wilmot is one of the teachers in
the Sunday-school, and the person who
has- caused all the pother. Wilmot's
class is formed <>f some of the older
. boys in the Sunday-school, and It was
to them ihat, on one Sunday, their in
structor in the Biblical teachings
lapsed around cipars and on the fol
lou'ing Sabbath boxes of cigarettes. In
.cidentally, it is reported that the cigars
made the boys sick, which may have
.been why Wilmot chose the less pow
erful â¢'coffin nail" with which to make
his second' presentation. It was Just
"after he had done so that the Mail's
rather misleading report called atten
tion to the thing, when the Rev. Mr.
'Lang swooped down on hi3 too zealous
assistant. To add to the clergyman's
.chagrin over the affair it was made
the subject of a discussion at the last
church congress in which he received
some hard jolts.
â¢ . One of tho most amusing results of
the case, however, was the verses
which the London Globe printed re
garding it and which were read at the
. X,rial the other day. Here they are:
.V O FUMOSE PUER.

Antwerp enjoys great natural ad
vantages and makes the most of them.
It is situated at the center of one of
the world's greatest highways of com
merce. There is a depth of twenty
seven feet alongside Its quays even at
low tide. B% reason of its position on
the river Scheldt fifty-one miles from
the sea it is absolutely protected from
all storms^ j
Â¦ It is the converging/point of a net
work of railways and canals, which
not only dissect the busy manufactur
ing country of Belgium,' but also form
part of the great land and water trans
port systems of Northwestern Europe.
This dual system of transport is not
only admirably arranged and adminis
tered by the Government, so far as
Belgium is concerned, but the freight
charges are also very low owing to
the competition of the two systems and
to the Government's railway policy of
low freights.
The port authorities are making great
efforts to keep pace with the increas
ing commerce by providing adequate
quay room and equipping the quays
with the latest appliances for the quick
handling of freight. In August, 1903.
2166 yards of new quays were opened to
traffic Lower down the river addition
al docks on which it is proposed to
spend 51,600,000 are in. course of con
struction and the Antwerp municipality
has decided to construct a new en
trance to the Intercalary docks at a
cost of $1,339,000. There Is a further
proposal on foot to construct a large
drydock capable of accommodating the
largest steamers that enter the port.
Accommodations for tank steamers has
been added to the quay up the river at
a cost of about $500,000. The length of
the outer quay is about 1000 feet and
the petroleum is conveyed through
pipes from the ships to large tanks
built for the purpose. Since the open
ing of these works In August 20,000
tons have been stored in them.
A comparison of these statistics of
recent and projected improvements
with similar figures for New York may
suggest good reasons for the predic
tion made by many business men here
that Antwerp's ocean commerce will
soon surpass that of New York. In
considering the figures it must be borne
in mind, too, that every dollar is hon
estly expended and accounts for a dol
lar's worth of work. THe Belgians are
a hustling people, but they don't brag
about it. They are satisfied with "get
tins there."
the making of any fuss. The munici
pality does all It can and the Govern
ment helps and private merchants as
sist and all pull together. Politics,
which checks the developments of so
many great public enterprises In Amer
ica, plays no part in It. There are no
"steals," no office "plums" to be picked,
no "spoils" for the victors at the polls.
It Is all a matter of straightforward,
go-ahead business.
The failures for the week were 202, against 203 for
the same week last year, which is not a bad showing.
The April railway earnings, as far as received, show a
falling off of 5.5 per cent from last year.
There is one feature, however, which is very promi
nent and reassuring and that is the abundance of money.
It seems to be. rejnarkably plentiful everywhere. In
New York it is^an actual, drug at 1 per cent for call and
2 to 4 per cent for time loans, with large blocks offered
without finding borrowers. As long as funds continue*"
so abundant and so carefully handled as at present there
is little danger of financial or mercantile trouble. The
railroads are taking advantage of this surplusage to make
immense borrowings, in regard to which Henry Clews,
the New York financier, says: "Another factor which
adds to the conservative feeling in Wall street is the im
mense borrowings by railroads and other corporations
on short time notes. Some estimates put the amount
of such loans during the last six months at about $300,
000,000. These figures probably explain the high record
loans of the New York banks, "which are exceedingly well
satisfied to find such safe and profitable employment for
their funds when ordinary business requirements are
diminishing. These loans will probably be turned into
fixed capital when the bond market improves, but during
the interval the temporary locking up of such large sums
will tend to discourage excessive, speculation; otherwise
we might see a plethora of loanable funds with all the
attendant evils of such a condition. . Financial conditions
are probably the most satisfactory of any in the great
divisions of business. The mercantile .situation is cer
tainly sound, but business is diminishing in volume."
As frequently mentioned of late, the best commercial
reports come from the Pacific Coast. Indeed, this has
been the case for a year or more. During this period
there has been a remarkable demand in the three States
for all sorts of farm products, principally wheat, barley,
hay, canned fruits, dairy products, hops and potatoes.
As these are very important staples on this coast the re
sult has been high prices and an absorption of every
thing produced in these lines. . During the past few
months Russia and Japan have been very heavy pur
chasers of forage, and from a financial standpoint the
Pacific Coast farmer has no complaint to make against
the war in the Orient. . ..
being closed down, and the. manufacturers say that riot
for half a century has there been so much depression in
these three lines. High prices for wool and cotton are
JargcJy the cause of this falling off in production, as the
wholesalers all over the country are proceeding with
caution and buying only a small, percentage of what they
usually buy at this. time of the year. The footwear fac
tories of the extreme East, however, are doing a very
gcod business, owing largely to the weather, which has
greatly increased the demand for heavy boots, shoes and
rubber goods. The West sends in reports of an active
call ior hides and leather, purchases of which have been
res.imed by large concerns, and the hide market is ruling
firm in consequence.
Provisions continue in liberal supply, though buying
in Chicago has lately been larger and of a better char
acter. The market in California has, ruled dull at the
decline or a week ago, while supplies are liberal. There
is nothing new in /he iron and steel trades, pig irpn being
quiet and weak.
The usual statistics continue to indicate a gradual
diminution oi commercial activity. The bank clearings
of the country last week were 14.4 per cent under those
of the corresponding week last year and the aggregate
clearings were only about $r, 800,000,000. All important
cities except Chicago, New Orleans, St. Louis and
Minneapolis showed a decrease, that at New York being
22.2 per cent and that at Pittsburg 26.2 per cent. The
increase at St. Lotiis was 12.2 per cent, but that was
owing to the opening of the exposition, which has en
livened business all. over the region tributary to that city.
The falling off in New York is about equally chargeable
to the decline in general trade and the inactivity in
stocks, ,which is pronounccdv Very little 'business is
being done on the Stock Exchange now, and on at least
one day last week the brokers whiled away the time by
playing pranks upon one another. Prices sho\V little
fluctuation, the public are still out of the market, and
there is no tendency, either up or down.
GENERAL trade conditions last week were about
the same as for the preceding week. The
weather continued unfavorable in the main, re
tarding cotton and, spring wheat seeding in some regions,
though during the past several days the latter has been
proceeding more briskly. The general condition of the
wheat crop, as reported by different experts, shows some
deterioration since the first of April, theV cold, wet
weather having retarded both germination and plant
growth. It hasTalso almost eliminated the usual spring
demand for goods, and some commercial reports say that
the extreme backwardness of the season has practically
brought the winter and summer seasons together, leav
ing the spring movement wholly out. .
The building industry has also been affected by the
adverse weather, and operations are smaller than they
would be were the weather more propitious. Some sec
tions report a good demand for building material and
others the reverse. The best reports are. being received
from the Pacific Coast cities, almost all doing a large
amount of building. Taken as a whole, the record of
business for Apn'Â« was not very satisfactory, as the vol
ume was less than during April, 1903, while the margin
of profit was also smaller. The export of wheat and
flour has been poor for some weeks and last week's rec
ord was the smallest for fourteen years, amounting to
only 1,010,850 bushels, against 3,418,239 during the cor
responding week a year ago, 5,308,600 in 1902 and 5,100,-,
coo in 1901.
The textile trades are sending in unfavorable reports.
In Philadelphia, for instance, the carpet, cotton and
woolen mills have so little to do that some of them are

\{S'.rA Stretch of Conscience.
They were telling railroad stories at
the LJck Houseâ a bunch of veterans.
Said on old-timer:
"Some years ago, while I was a
traveling auditor on the C. B. and
Q., I was sent to a station some dis
tance from Chicago, to check up an
agent's accounts. There was a sus
picion that something was wrong and
I was instructed not to overlook a
trickâ to settle" once and for all the
doubts as to the man's affairs with
the company. In due time I landed at
K. and hastened to the office. The
agent received me affably, showed me
the books, waybills, expense sheets and
invited me over to the freight house
to check uo the undelivered freight.
There he left, me for a moment. I
peeped out and saw him hurry to the
depot office.' Without waiting I fol
lowed him and sat down behind an
open window where i' could distinctly
1 catch the clicking of the telegraph in
struments.
"I knew the code as well as any
agent, in fact served my time In the
station. My ears causht the message:
'Bring $200 over quick. They a~re
checking me up."
Without investigating further I
suddenly peeped into the office and de

A minute later the agent came to me
and shoved 5200 in bills into my hands,
saying, 'You overlooked that.'
"I knew the man would be ruined
unless I accepted it. It meant more
than ruin because he had only been

had saved him was his father. I
stretched my conscience and took the

make his accounts balance. After my

ment of this city. Auxiliary bodies having at heart mat
ters of common interest will also be invited to' co-operate
through an advisory council made up of. delegates. The
improvements contemplated extend over a v wide field.
In a general way the association will" deem it within its
province to offer recommendations â and perhaps pro
tests, as occasion may require â to the various boards and
officers of the 'municipality upon, matters of an artistic
and esthetic nature that come within the sphere of its
purposes.
* More particularly, the- questions -already under discus
sion are as to the feasibility of a municipal salt water
works, a Golden Gate Park aquarium, encouraging
architecture of a higher standard, a mammoth fire-proof
auditorium for conventions, an annual grand opera sea
son, a conservatory of music,' a suitable approach to
Golden Gate Park or an extension of the panhandle to
Van Ness avenue, a possible purchase of the Laguna
de la Merced property with its chain of lakes, a roadway
along the bay shore, extending Market street to the
ocean, the building of winding roads up the city's hills,
an observatory on the summit of Buena Vista Park, an
open air amphitheater, an 'art museum, and, lastly, the
reclamation of Chinatown. >
The attainment of all that is perhaps not to be ex
pected by this generation, but some one has said "Strive
ior the stars and grab at the moon as you drop." Men
of the caliber of those in the association can accomplish
much, and while it would be quixotic to expect Chinatown
to be speedily bf ought to the point of exhaling perfumes,
Â»ome improvement at least in its condition may be made,
while many of the other features, with concerted action,
are easily within reach of accomplishment. We are not,
like the dwellers, of some 'cities, stuck in, the middle ; of
a flat plain and left to our, own unassisted efforts to make
a' city beautiful. On the contrary, nature, has been kind
to us and we should appreciate her efforts, and assist
her. We have a varied landscape in our rolling hills, a
marine view in our famous bay and the boundless ocean
and a climate unexcelled. With such possibilities and a
healthy energy success, must come.
It might be suggested that the title of the organization
be shortened to the "Adornment Association," for while
the motive is "the improvement and adornment of San
Francisco," that phrase is too cumbersome for common
use in speaking of the association itself.

The California State building at the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition, at SL
Louis, stands on a hill, in a conspicuous
position, near the center of the Exposi
tion grounds. While there are many re
markable buildings that will attract the
attention of millions of visitors while
the Exposition gates are open, there , is
not one that has more intrinsic interest
than the California building.
It is a reproduction, with great fidelity
to detail, of tho' famous Santa Barbara
Mission. To make the reproduction per
fect the front has been/ chipped and
stained and grass seeds have been sown
between the flagstone pavements, that
the ravages of time and the characteris
tics to the most minute degrees may be
presented to the spectator, who may
thereby see a vista of historical interest
exactly in accordance with the original.
' The story is current that no woman
has been allowed to enter the garden of
the Santa Earbara Mission, although
there may'have been a few exceptions.
At St. LoulSL the famous garden is en
tirely reproduced. The fountain is in the
center; the old wooden benches are imi
tated and are placed as in the Santa Bar
bara Mission grarden. The same varieties
of plants that have bloomed for more
than a century for the padres of Santa
Barbara will make up the gardens show
at St; Louis. Superintendent McLaren
of Golden Gate Park has been given
charge of the collection of such plants.
Samuel Newsom, the architect of the
building, visited Santa Barbara several
limes and made a study of the garden,
as well. as of tbfe building and its sur
roundings, for exposition purposes.
Every Californian will wish to have a
picture of the California building at St.
Louis.
The California State structure stands
next to the Illinois State building, and
the Fraternal Hall. and Temple Inn are
its neighbors. Not. far away is the great
Agricultural-building, the largest struc
ture in the world, having twenty acres
under one roof. Directly opposite the
California building are the Japanese
gardens.
The^ California building has a facade

destined to be realized, if indeed, such
was entertained by any one.- Some
Cne has styled Point Richmond "the
..I/ittEburg of the Pacific." It may
some time *be entitled to that title.
X<jthing in its history to date Is slow.
.'Whatever measure of growth it may
have, the name describes the lines on
which it has so far progressed. In
JCovember. 1900. there were but four

Richmond. Tb-day, within the area
shut in by the hills and spreading out
09 the comparatively flat country that
rearhes away toward the Coast Range
.To start* with it had deep water,
pleasing climate and nearness to San
l-^ranciseo. Everything else in sisht,
less than four years ago, that might
promise wealth, was agricultural and
;nore particularly grazing. The siti
of Point Richmond Is hidden from the
bay by a range of hills that tower up
to the height of several hundred feet.
â¢ A. body of shallow water led from the
bay into the center of what ie now
largely the industrial section of Point
Richmond. Cattle grazed on the hill
cides. The wild flowers covered the
in the spring In great profusion.
In the shelter provided by the hills or
chards might have been grown succeso
'fully and a source of eupply for the
San Francisco market might have been
added.
-â¢No account of recent progress in Cal
ifornia would b<? complete without th"
%t<--?y of what has been accomplished
" ih'the' .(.-omrnunities that surround the
â¢Hay of San Francisco. Indeed, whiie
'rhej-e are many parts of this State thiit
have reason to be proud of their ad
fancemem, it Is undoubtedly true that
-the greatest growth in proportion to
territory in California* in the last few
j - cars' must be credited to San Fran
c$SÂ£0 and other communities on th<e
shore of San Francisco Bay.
! '. Something of this has been detailed,
Â¦in reference to the east bay shore, dui
rsr.g 1 the last feiv weeks in special ar
ticles in The Call.
'Oakland, Alameda and Berkeley have
individually been given large ppaee
that their advantages and their aspir

Jtirhrn^nd to Emeryville. Oakland is
â¢iiolHng forward to the event. So are
'Jiohkeley and Point Richmond, for on

arid the older places will receive Point
Richmond into daily fellowship.
.^Thls morning something of the story
i~i Point Richmond is to!d and the nar
"rutive may not lack interest for the
people of all sections of the Stale; cer-
Wiinly it will be read in the counties

' NATURAL ADVANTAGES.
' The large amount of 120,000 barrels of
oil a day, so the Point . Richmond peo
ple say, cap be moved dally, from the
Kern River field by the pipe line. ;The
array of storage tanks/monotonous ob
jects to look at, nevertheless are very
suggestive for what they promise.
There are numerous sites that can be
utilized for the establishment of man
ufacturing plants.
Factories at Point Richmond, so it is
argued by the Point Richmond people,
are singularly advantaged. The Stand
ard Oil Company has an exhaustless
In quite a large area huge oil* tanks
abound. In them Is stored the darka.nd
viscous petroleum that is pumped from
underneath the sands near the Kern
Rjver and Is moved, at considerable
daily cost, from the foot, of the' San
Joaquin , Valley, hundreds of miles
away, to tidewater on San Francisco
Bay. Other* oil supplies arriving by
steamer from Ventura or elsewhere are
pumped up from " a large plant on the
bay shore at the endj of the deep water
wharf of Point Richmond to the works
in the heart of Point Richmond.
Mr. Arnold, who sold the first lots
in Point Richmond, estimates that
when the San Joaquin Valley road,
which afterward became an integral
part of the Santa Fe system, entered
what is now. Point Richmond, land at
f40 an acre would have been high
priced. Now there are business blocks,
a great oil refinery, factories and vari
ous enterprises, half a dozen hotels
and the hundreds of homes of the pop
ulation on land that has a front foot
value.
' "There are about 2000 acres that have
been opened up," said Mr. Arnold.
"These are now worth, on the average,
from $4000 to 55000 an acre." An ad
vance from ?40 an acre to the lower
valuation mentioned by Mr. Arnold,
$4000 an acre, would cause the increase
in value to which industry has given
rise to be counted in the millions of
dollars. ,
Mountains on the east, there are acres
devoted to manufacturing industries.
In any direction smoke or steam rises
all day long to tell of work and work
men.
* STANDARD OIL PLANT.
Turn northward and the shrill tat
too of electric riveting machines may
be heard throughout the hours of la
bor, where mechanics are putting up
continually new tanks, for the Stan
dard Oil Company to fill with petro
leum that is brought nearly three hun
dred miles by pipe line â all the way
from the famous Kern River oil fields.
From scores of chimneys on the
many buildings on the large land
holdings of the Standard Oil Company
parti-colored smoke rises, now thinly
and again in dense massei that ob
scure the^un, when all the stills used
In the refining of oil In the present
plant are in use.
Turning toward the east, In the cow
pastures of but yesterday, are planing
mills, an iron foundry, the shops and
roundhouses and great car yards of
the Santa Fe. The people also boast
of their three brickyards, of a stone
cutting plant that has been created, of
the deep water wharf that has been
run out to and on into the bay for the
accommodation of vessels that bring
in crude oil or other articles,' of the
franchise that has been given to the
Southern Pacific Company to build
other wharves on the bay front, of the
population, which was nothing in 190O
and is now about 4000, of the Santa Fe
Railway that runs through Richmond;
especially of the Standard Oil plant,
which, with its accompanying pipe
lines represents an outlay of several
millions of dollars; of an electric rail
way to connect the Standard Oil plant
with alk parts of Point Richmond; of
the great combination of advantages,
natural and acquired, that have re
sulted In such growth In four years
and promise still greater things for
the future.
GROWTH OF VALUES.
The first Impulse that was given
toward the settlement and prosperity
of Point v Richmond was supplied by
the San Joaquin Valley road, which
made the place accessible by a regular
and fine route of travel. The main line
of the Southern Pacific Railway passes
only about a mile distant. The rails
are laid for an electric line to connect
with the Southern Pacific. The. Santa
Fe and Southern Pacific companies
both reach the works of the Standard
Oil Company and move over their rails
into Point "Richmond long trains of
tank cars.
Transportation facilities by., rail and
by water are still the. key of the Point
Richmond situation. There is: a good
outlook for Improvement in this particu
lar. Within a few months, In addition
to connection with its neighbors by
steam road, Point Richmond "^JIl have
an electric line In operation to^erke
ley.
It may surprise many to learn thlt
Poin( Richmondâ or Richmond, for
there^'are two portions of the place â is
not a city when considered from the
standpoint of government; it is simply
one of the most populous portions of
Contra Costa County, and it is subject
only to the government of the Super
visors of Contra Costa County. Incor
poration will be one of the topics for
consideration after At present
the larger interests that are in Point
Richmond are opposed to incorporation
on account of the increased taxation
that would result.
The accompanying pictures tell very
well the story of the remarkable growth
of Point Richmond. The date when
all existing houses in Point Richmond
were less than half a dozen, as shown
in one view, was November 1, ,1900. The
view that illustrates Point Richmond
as It looks now from the hills above
it, was taken by an artist for The Calf
on Friday of last week. Point Rich
mond boasts of two daily papers, which
are well edited and alive to the In
terests of the town. â¢ 'Â¦-<; '":.!',
Contact with the spectacle of rapid
and solid home growth and familiarity
with large enterprises have accustomed
the Point Richmond dwellers to think
that place has only begun Its career
as a' manufacturing center. The fa
miliar topics of conversation take in the
possibility of the removal of grain ele
vators from farther up the bay to Point
Richmond as a measure of economy in
time and money for those that are
engaged in shipping and commerce.

reservoir, of oil in the Kern River dis
trict to draw from, and It has accumu
lated a great surplus at Point Rich
mond, and especially at a station a few
miles from Point Richmond, all of
which is available as cheap fuel.
The Standard Oil Company can put
down a short pipe line to any factory in
the neighbourhood, and an abundance of
cheap motive power is assured. The
Standard Oil Company can manufac
ture a large variety of valuable by
products; still it always has petroleum
enough to supply fuel to all comers.
A sale of quite a large block of land
close to the works of the Standard Oil
Company has just been recorded. The
belief at Point Richmond is that this
means the establishment of a large
manufactory of agricultural Imple
ments and possibly an automobile mak
ing industry.

Solemn renewal of pledges of the
Leagrue of the Cross were adminis
tered yesterday afternoon by Arch
bishop Montgomery in St. Mary's
Cathedral,, to-about 2700 young men
and boys. The service is held an
nually and grows more, impressive
each year; The first regiment, 1200
strong, was in full uniform and with
Its "banners flying to the breeze and
stepping to martial music, marched
into the cathedral shortly after 2
o'clock and was followed by the sec
ond regiment and cadets.
The altar had been decorated with
cut flowers, and aa the strains of the
organ pealed forth with "Veni Cre

kneeled while prayer for the church
and civil authorities was read. The
hymn "While Ages Course Along"
was sung by the choir, and congre
gation and at its conclusion Arch
bishop Montgomery delivered an im
pressive sermon on the evils of the
liquor traffic and the joys to be ob

touch, taste nor handle. He said in
part:

In the past. We as citizens of San Francisco
face a menace to- happiness and future salva
tion. This city is overrun with saloons, and
I only wish the ' Mayor and other offlctala
could be here now to sec this gathering of
young: men and boys who are Imbued with the
thought of stamping out the evil by standing
him to your pledges.
Some twelve years ago the fact became ap
parent that something must be done to save
our young men and boys from the drink
habit. The Ltagu<: of the Cross was formed
with the hope that it would grow Into an or
ganization of etrensth. and that hope has
been realized. There are now two tuil regi
ments of well -drilled young men and boys
who could enter the field at any time to de
fend their country. Each v year since you
have brcn banded together you have renewed
your, pledges, and with the sign of the cross
always with you. you will stand drm for the
principles of your order.
On every side young men are menaced by
saloons. It has been said that many Catho
lics are engaged in the business, if it can be
called a business. Some twenty years ago
an appeal was made to the Catholics who
were engaged in the traffic to abandon their
calling and enter vocations that were more in
keeping with the teachings of our church and
which do not nap the vitality of the country
nor cause misery and crime. In Instances the
appeal was carried out.
It lg to you youug men and boys that we
look to put down the saloons in our city. You
are receiving a traininR which place you in
the' best ranks of, our clttztna and will bring
to you In later years happiness and ever
lasting life. You young men will learn lhat

THE FUTURE REVEALED. THE PAST
DISCLOSED.
The Present Analyzed by Livingstone.
PROF. LIVINGSTONE'S readings are like
a living page of Flammarlon's treatise that is
so electrifying the world to-day. lie Is no
lmltatar. His work Is upon original lines,
pure thought, clear vision. He tells you what
you desire . to know and works in the open
light.
He Is as conspicuous for his wonderful occult
analysis as he la for his original expression
and vivid truthfulness.
A test reading Is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full life reading for $1. A test
Is of little value; when the mind la troubled
you need more substantial aid and advice.
Tills Is Juat what PROF. LIVINGSTONE
give* you when you call on him for a first-
clans clairvoyant reading.
He asks you no questions, but tells you
what you wish to know.
He does not mention all the Ilia and mls-
fortunew you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts In your case. Let PROF. LIV-
INGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, find the cause of trouble and
suggest the remedy.

FREN'CH CRUISER A FAILURE.
The French armored cruissr Jeanne
d'Arc. 11,200 tons, is still unable to at
tain the calculated speed of 23 knots.
The trials began as far back as July,
1901, and have continued intermittently
up to the present time. Th<? engines
have developed 30.000 horsepower, but
the highest speed was only 21.8 knots.
Prior to the trial last month the bilgo
keels had been reduced in depth and
new propellers fitted, but without suc
ceeding in any visible Improvement of
speed. The vessel may be classed as
a failure, for it is not alone that the
boilers, of the Guyot type, have proved
unsuitable, but the engines have devel
oped serious defects and the excessive
vibrations of the hull under high speed
are so great as to make proper gun
service Impossible.
A recâanization plan has been form
ulated for the engineer branch of the

early hour yesterday morning with a large
load of water front "booze" aboard. He
got tangled up with the gangplank and hau

An unusual eight was witnessed in the
etream yesterday. The Mohican and the Pe
trel were both coaling at the same time. Be
tween them lay the big coaling barge from
which coal was being dumped first on one
ship and ' then on the other. Around them
hovered their ship's launches, their own small
boats, and a great bunch of shore boats crowd
ed with people who wished to board them. Ad
mission, however, was refused to all. Th^

TheAtallan warship Liguria was visited by
throngs of people from early morn till late at
night yesterday. In fact at times there were
so many on board that it was almost Impos
sible to move about th$ ship. A perfect swarm
or tugs and small boats surrounded her all
day long. The launches of McNeill, Peterson
and Crowle.y did a thriving business, and their
loaded fleets were going all day long.

Prey turned and struck Carpenter in
the face and then leaped into a buggy
and was driving away. Turning he
dared Carpenter to shoot. Carpenter
raised his revolver and fired one shot.
The bullet passed through the buggy
seat, entered Frey's body and the horse
started to run. The animal was stopped
half a mile from the place by two men
who had heard the shot, and they
started to drive to the city with the
wounded man, but he died on the way.
Carpenter did not know his shot had
taken effect until half an hour after
ward, when a squad of city detectives
reached the blace and began to Inves
tigate the shooting, it having been re
ported to them that Frey had been
shot during a general fight. Carpenter
at once admitted that he had fired the
shot. He was arrested and at the po
lice station booked on a charge of mur
der. He. has been an officer for a year.
LOS ANGELES, May 1.â While try
ing to escape arrest during: a raid upon
a cocking main In the river bottom
north of the city this afternoon C. Da
vid Frey, a well-to-do butcher, v was
shot by C. F. Carpenter, an officer of
the Society for the Prevention of Cru
elty to Animals, and died in twenty
minutes while being brought to this
city for medical treatment.
Headed by Special Officer N. W. Zim
mer of the society, six officers planned
to raid the place, where for months
cocking mains have been held every
Sunday. Four of the officers went to
the place early and witnessed the
matches, and later two others ap
proached the 'place, their appearance
being the signal for the other officers
to act. When the raid began Frey
started to run and Carpenter caught
him.

Eleven old ships were sold by auc
tion at the Chatham dockyard on April
14. realizing $244,225. Seventeen werfe
originally scheduled for sale, but the
torpedo gunboats Plassy and Assaye,
the gunboats Melita and Linnet and a
small cutter were withdrawn. In place
of which the old Forte, formerly a
screw frigate, was substituted. The old
Belleisle brought $43,000 and the Duke
of Wellington $41,750. The latter price
should prove a good bargain on account
of the great quantity of copper bolts
and sheathing put In ships-of-/var built
of wood. " None but British subjects
were allowed to be present at the auc
tion, greatly to the disgust of several
foreigners, who were left outside the
dockyard gate.
The British Admiralty has been in
formed by Admiral Cyprian Bridge,
late commander in chief of the China
squadron, that he did not consider the
battleship Centurion fit to go Into ac
tion. The ship, recently rearmed, joined
the China squadron without havlwgr^a
single serviceable gunsight. and Sir Ar
nold White stated In Parliament that
other ships were similarly defective.
The . armored cruiser. Leviathan, the
latest addition to the China squadron,
was busy on March 10 altering her
gunsights, the commander in chief hav
ing officially reported that the recent
bad firing by that ship was due to her
having used the sightir supplied by the
Admiralty. The incorrectness of the
gunsights could only be proved by re
peated failures of good gunners to make
good practice shots, and the work of
alteration must be "made by the me
chanics on board the respective vessels
Three of the thieves who stole six
bronze guns from the Woolwich Com
mon last December have been arrested
and confessed the crime, but the, guns
cannot be recovered, as they have long
since gone into the melting pot. The
stolen ordnance was interesting be-
The British battleship Queen. 15,000
tons. 15,000 horsepower and eighteen
knots speed, was commissioned April 2
and was to sail April 17 for the Medi
terranean. The Queen was built at
Devonport dockyard; her keel laid
March 12, 1901; launced March 8. 1902;
steam trial December 5. 1903. and the
time of construction and completion
has therefore been three years and
twenty-one days. The Prince of Wales,
sister s.hio to the Queen, built at Chat
ham, will exceed this time by about
one month. The British dockyards no
longer lag in. their work of construction,
due largely to the introduction of mod
ern machine tools, improved business
methods and the natural rivalry be
tween the working forces of two or
more dockyards in building vessejs
identical in all their details. The esti
mated cost of the Queen, exclusive of
armament. Is 55,406.825. and that of the
Prince of Wales $5,577,260. the difference
being due to slightly higher wages paid
to some classes^ of mechanics at Chat
ham.
Satisfactory progress is being made
on the ships building for the United
States navy. The average advance
during March was about 3 per cent on
the battleships and armored cruisers,
due chiefly to the fact that there is lit
tle or any private work going on at the
yards to take precedence of Govern
ment contracts. The race between the
New York Navy Yard and the Newport
News Yard, where the Connecticut and
Louisiana, respectively, are building.
is still on. with chances favoring the
Newport News, although It lost seven
tenths of 1 per cent of its lead during
March. As for the smaller vessels
building at "the navy yards, the two
training ships Cumberland and In
trepid are well along. The Cumber
land, at the Boston Navy Yard, was
28.5 per cent completed, while the In
trepid, building at Mare Island, has
only advanced to 12 per cent, owing to
the failure of getting the material
wanted.
Two candidates for admission to An
napolis have been nominated from
Michigan, whose somewhat unusual
names are sure to attract the attention
of the fun loving youngsters at the
Naval Academy. One is named Pitcher
and comes from Cold Water, Mich.;
the other is handicapped with the name
of Leopold Katzlantschltsch. In the
event of his passing the preliminary
examination his name will be the long
eat and most unusual ever entered on
the books of the academy, but - his
brother midshipmen may be depended
upon to designate him by some easier
name. There is still another candidate
whom the middies will welcome; he
comes from Texas and bears the femi
nine name of Edna Lee Meyers.
The efforts to have the old frigate
Constitution restored to its original
condition have been defeated in the
conference committee of House and
Senate. The Senate had proposed an
appropriation of $400,000 to make it a
training and receiving ship, but the
Navy Department did not favor the
proposition, and the old historical craft
will probably be allowed to go to decay
and her name be given to some modern
ship yet to be built.
BRITISH BOILERS FOR NEW XAVY
The London Chronicle of April 8
states that the United States has given
an order to Babcock & Willcox of Glas
gow for fifty boileVs, amounting to
about 50,000 horsepower, for battleships
and cruisers. The vessels to be fitted
with these boilers are the battleships
Georgia, Virginia, Minnesota, Vermont
and Indiana, the monltorMonterey and
gunboats Dubuque and Paducah. In the
case of the Georgia and Virginia the
Babcock & "Willcox boilers will take the
place of Niclausse boilers as first in
tended. The latter boilers have not
given entire satisfaction on the battle
ship Maine. The London Chronicle
comments on this order as "a gratify
ing instance of British manufacturers
not only holdfng their own against
American competition, but of success
fully invading- the American market."
The Babcock & Willcox boiler is in
stalled in or planned for thirty vessels
In the United States navy. It is a Brit
ish Improvement of the water-tube
type and its original place of/ manu
facture is at Renfrew, Scotland. Works,
however, have been established in
France, Germany and the United States
and the statement that boilers have
been ordered from Scotland for our
naval vessels is undoubtedly incorrect.
Such an order would be a direct viola
tion of the law under which our new
navy is being built, and while it was
violated by the late chief constructor
in some minor instances, sanctioned by
the Secretary of the Navy, the whole
sale importation of 'foreign boilers
would not be tolerated. The act of
August 3. 1886, still in force, prescribes:
"That the engines, boilers and machin
ery of all the new vessels provided for
Jt>y this act shall be of domestic manu
facture and procured by contract, un
less the Secretary of the Navy shall be
unable to obtain the same at fair prices,
in which case he may construct the
same, or any portion thereof, in the
navy yards of the United States." The
act of August, 1903, provides: "All
said vessels shall be built in compli
ance with said act (of 1886) and in all
their parts be of domestic machinery
and the steel material shall be of do
mestic manufacture." Therefore, while
orders have been placed for fifty Bab
cock & Willcox boilers the work will be
done at Bayonne, New Jersey, and not
in Scotland.

tically certain for to-morrow, the thir
tieth running 'of the classic Kentucky
Derby over the track of the New

only to attract an immense crowd, but
to furnLsh a more open race than was
thought possible a few days ago. Pro
ceeds,- Captain S. S. Brown's entry,
will .go to the post favorite, but fair
weather and a fast track are regarded
as improving the chances of the other
entries. Brancas and Prince Silver
Wings will have about equal support.
Ed Tierney will also have considerable
backing. Elwood will probably be at
the longest price. The five animals
will doubtles make up the field for

PITTSBURG DEFEATS CHICAGO.
Harry Powell, aged seven years, and
his brother Earl, aged five years, re
siding with their parents at 1212 Do
lores street, had a narrow escape from
being drowned yesterday afternocfn in
a pool of fresh water at Alabama and
Army streets. The boys, who are re
cent arrivals from Texas, on seeing the
water took a notion to have a swim
and plunged into the, deceptive pool.
After swimming about for some .time
they got tangled up in a lot of weeds
and becoming nervous went to the
bottom. Their predicament was ob
served by a man. who plunged in
without removing his clothing and
succeeded in carrying the pair to the
bank. ; where Â»Pollceman Robl placed
them over a barrel until such time as
the patrol wagon arrived from the
Seventeenth-street station, when they
were sent to the City and County^Hos
pital.and resuscitated after consider
able difficulty. The brave man who
rescued them left before his name
could be ascertained.

The first primary election of the
season and also the first May primary
under the new election law will take
place" to-morrow. Delegates to the
Republican State Convention at Sac
ramento, delegates to the Fourth Con
gressional District Republican Con
vention;; to be held in this city, and
delegates to the Democratic State Con
vention: at Santa Cruz will be chosen
by the voters" of San Francisco. There
are no indications of a large vote. In
fact, the registration for this event
is only a little more than 32.000. The
Republicans of the Thirty-ninth Dis
trict have managed* to create a con
test in order to determine at the out
set of the campaign which of the
three factions in the district ;ls en
titled to recognition as. the dominant
power in the Thirty-ninth. â Party
leaders hold that it is just as well tot
the Republicans of the district to fight
it out now in order that peace may
come later on.
Primary Election To-31orrow.
Morley opens with Du Bols to-night
and an interesting match is looked
for, as both are playing up to their
best form.
Frank Pechart. who claims the class
B championship, declined to enter the
tournament because he deemed it be
low his dignity to accept odtls of 2 tol
from any amateur. Pechart was
goaded into a trial match by specta
tors and Wright defeated him, 300
to 70, the winner making his quota
in twenty-four innings for an average
of better than 12. If the class B men
live up to their work the scratch men
must come close to that average in
thq tournament to carry away the
priaes.
The uncertainty of billiards has
been emphasized during the last few
days when the players in the balk-line
tournament, which begins at Morley's
to-night, have competed in friendly
matches. Wright and Sigourney give
Burns, Du- Bols, Coffin and Morley a
handicap of 300 to 150 points in the
officials odds, yet Morley defeated
Wright in a practice game Saturday
evening at about the reverse ratio of
points.

â¢ VThe people don't like him: he is too
erratic and uncertain," said he. "There
has not been a time in twenty years
when the office of the President of the.
United States has been so abused by
the man who occupied the position:
Never have the interests of the nation
been so subordinate to private ends- as
since President Roosevelt has been in
office. The Democrats have seldom. If
ever, had a better opportunity to elect
a President than . right now, and with
the right man the defeat of Roosevelt
can We easily accomplished.' . . ' ' .
"In my opinion Judge Parker will de
feat Mr. Hearst, and Mr. Hearst will
defeat Judge Parker, and then we will
nominate the right man, . who In my
opinion is none other than Judge Har
mon of this city. He Is an exception
ally good man and one who would suc
ceed in harmonizing every Democratic
interest in the country." ;

SALT LAKE, Utah, May 1.â Louise
Grace Emery, daughter of the "Silver
Queen" of Utah, Mrs. Susanna Brans
ford Emery-Holmes, to-day became of
age. With the arrival of her eighteenth
'birthday she came into possession, of
an estate conservatively valued at $4,
000,000.
Suitors by the score have been seek
ing her hand In the past. Now that
she has clear title to all the property,
it is expected that they will be num
bered'by the hundred. .^
Her 'mother has taken every precau
tion to guard her' from adventurers.
She was anxious that the fact of the
girl's arrival at'maturity be kept secret
because of the fear of a horde of for
tuneÂ»iiunters. They will be kept at
arm's length, however. Already they
are flooding the mails with missives
protesting undying devotion, <but these
epistles are only a source of amuse
ment.
Miss Emery's . father, A. B. Emery,
was once a poor bookkeeper in the em
ploy, of the Ontario mine in Park City,
Utah," which is controlled by J. B. Hag
gin and the George ; Hearst estate.
With four others he began the develop
ment of a promising prospect in Park
City, near the Ontario. The others
were Thomas Kearns, then a common
miner, now United States Senator from
Utah; David Keith,* foreman at the
Ontario .mine: James Ivers, a livery
man; and. John.' Judge, a miner em
ployed at the Daly mine.
â¢ The prospect .they developed, became
the great Silver King mine, valued
conservatively at $10,000,000. Its "an
nual dividends are $1,300,000. Miss
Emery owns now in her own right 12,
500 shares of this stock. This brings
her an annual income of $108,250. " Dur
ing the ten years slnce-thls amount of
stock was -set aside to her in trust,
she'has received over $1,000,000 indivi
dends; Her* mother has been executrix
of the will and has invested this in
come carefully. The money has been
placed in other Utah mines and In Salt
Lake real estate, which . Is increasing
steadily in value. . . :
Fully 3000 persons enjoyed the hos
pitality of the Knights of the Red
Branch yesterday-, at Shell Mound
Park, West Berkeley. The weather
was favorable for an outing, the trees
and shrubbery in the park were In
rich foliage; the sun bright, without
being too warm, and the air balmy
and invigorating. Dancing In the
large pavilion formed one of the main
attractions to more than 600 couples
and Gaelic jig and reel dancing and
athletic sports of various kinds, for
which valuable prices were distributed
by the committees in charge, were a
source of unalloyed pleasure to sev
eral thousand merrymakers who were
present from Oakland, San Francisco
and interior towns and cities.
The credit of the festival, which wail
a notable one In the annals o"f this
popular Irish society. Is due to the un

On March 31/ the day on which Con
gressman Bell made his statefnents in
Congress ; to the: effect \ that the mem
bers of theihome are compelled. to take
their pension^ money, in canteen checks,
the officers of the r home.'were complet
ing the payment In cash of $13,667 10
on account of pensions. . ,
â¢ W.-.S. Melick . and A. B. Nye left '..the
home this ; afternoon via Napa â¢ Junc
tion for ' Sacramento. , They/regard the
new hosp'ital for, the care of veterans
as, the model building of the State.
It Is the Impression that the Governor
will allow the use of the $10,000 reserved
to complete the hospital and .that the
directors will close the San Francisco
office. . â¢
Nye and Mellck, representing tha
Gdverno'r and the State Board of Ex
aminers, did. not give assurance that
a deficiency 'would be authorized to
make good canteen losses, but indicated
that the 'State authorities would offer
all assistance possible without the cre
ation of a deficiency. . . Â»
Figures showing the receipt and dis
bursement of pension money were sub
mitted to the representatives of the
Governor by Colonel George W. Walts,
commandant. The Congressional Rec
ord waa quoted to showtnat Congress
man Bell made the' positive charge in
the" House of Representatives that the
California' Soldiers' Home in his district
retained all the pensions of the-mem
bers of the home and paid them back
In canteen checks only. On the strength
of this assertion the State of California
was defamed by several .of
Congress and California did not have
a member of Congress" present to speak
the truth and protect the honor of tha
State. .
The statement of Colonel Walts pre
sented to the Governor's representa
tives wa9 as follows: 'â¢ Amount of pen
sion money paid in cash to pensioners
from May 1, 1903 to May. 1904, $72,720 37.
Amount of canteen checks sold to pen
sioners for the same period; $5654 30.
This is 54 cents a month per capita in
checks on \the average, membership of
the home. *
Third â A proposition to abolish the" San
Francisco office and transact all the business
connected with the administration of the in
stitution at the home. The third proposition
was presented by the. Governor.
â¢ Secondâ Permission to create a deficiency of
$12,000 to make good the loss of revenue caused
by Congressman Hell's amendment abolishing
the canteen.
VETERANS' HOME, YOUNTVILLE,
May 1.â A. B. Nye, private secretary
of Governor Pardee"; W. S. Mellck, sec
retary of the State Board of Examiners,
and all the directors of the home held
a prolonged conference here last night
and met again to-day to consider af
fairs that were not fully adjusted at
the session last evening. Three topics
were given the fullest consideration in
this order:
First â Application of the board of directors
for $10,000 of the sum of $23,000 appropriated
by the last Legislature for tho purpose of com
pleting the new hospital. The Governor ap
proved the bill for the whole amount on tha
agreement that the board would expend only
$15,000 at once and reserve $10,000 to be ex
pended If the executive deemed an expenditure
in excess of $15,000 absolutely' necessary to the
welfare of the Institution.

Hold Their Regular Competition
at Insleslde.
The California Wing Club held its
regular shoot at live birds at the
Ingleside grounds yesterday. The at
tendance was small and there were
not many guns in evidence. The birds
were strong and some good scores
were made.
Charles Laing, who has recently re
turned to the came, made an excel
lent showing, as did Pete Walsh and
Otto Feudner.
Following are the scores:

On Wednesday there will be a handi
cap at a mile and a hundred yards for
three-year-olds and upward..; ' . â¢ ...
A mile and a furlong handicap on
Saturday should bring together a fine
field. The same day there will be a
two-mile race.
The appointment of George Tuthill
as secretary of the State Agricultural
Society was hailed with general satis
faction by all classes of horsemen.
George possesses a thorough knowledge
of the business, if affable and popular,
and It Is prophesied 'that the coming
State Fair will be the greatest of re
cent years.
A most successful racing season will
be brought to a close when the last
race is decided a.t the New Californki
Jockey Club track at Oakland next Sat
urday. Never before in the history of
the sport on the coast has the attend
ance been so large. More books were
operated than during any previous
year, and the racing furnished has
given general satisfaction.
There will be no racing to-day, in
order to keep within the limit fixed by
the club ofilcials of 150 days. A good
card is offered for to-morrow'. The pro
gramme to be decided during the re

â¢ â¢ The champions did not have a whole
. ]ot"t-f Vtrength left at Recreation Park
yesterday, but they combined every
Â»Â»fi?jn <3f it in the sixth spasm. Two
tiJiies were then squeezed over the rub
.â¢Ver. The first one tied the score and
-'"tfce last one won the gume. It was a
' reigkiy struggle and the team that
pfciyed the best ball won. Score I to t
â¢ â¢_ Although the weather looked bad be
fore the game was caJled, the fans :
.forked to the Eighth street lot in num
b_ei;s: to the amount of about 10.000. The
diultitude seemed pleased when the
home elugrg-ers began to tear away at
the offerings of Doc Newton in the sec
ond inning. The only local ron was th?n
ushered past the plate and when Rab
bit Miller came through with the bingle
' ihat turned the trick every one in the
lot jvas pulling for him.
. ' The Angels will have to give thanks
- t'>-the ponderous Newton for their vic
. t< ry. He was the mysterious kid at
1 tyÂ»-. r"ight- time exct-pt in the second in
" iv.ws iund although he waxed wild at
. i.iomems and seemed due for a trip
" "inVj the -heavens, he always steadied
.jiGwn at the proper interval and in bo
â¢Â¦uojjp.g kept many a run at a distance,
â¢ . A\*haJen was about the same, barring
â¢* a iittle wildness. He had his one rocky ;
â¢inning and that one was enough to
iix .him for the afternoon. During the
eight the Angels had no license
*U< ;?ake base hits and many thought
on* 1 riin would win the struggle,
/rtu* initial run- of the game was
greeted, with a ringing cheer such as
. Â£â¢ nuine baseball fans generally turn
'. legse.* Irwin opened up the last half
if; tho fcecend inning with a jab tÂ»
â¢Vrsht lield which allowed him to ke*_-p
i mtt tor two bases. l.#eahy advanced him
on an. out, but Massey fanned the wind.
"Th'-.i Newton made a mistake. He
ivklkVd Anderson and figured on Miller
â¢ a* easy, but the "Rabbit" kicked out
a dazzh-r to left which brought Captain
â¢ < Jbasiey in and set the bleeehcrj? afire
" v Kh enthusiasm.
.It was Dins and needles and heart
palpitation for the next four rounds.
Newton was th^ first man up for thr
' Southerners in the sixth and he beal
â¢out a" scratch]* bit to the pitcher. Ber
nard was also lucky, bounding one
nvef Mat-soy's head and sending Ne\v
. ton "to sack three. Flood poked a good
"one to right and Doc arrived. Whalen
" grew suspicious of Cravath and gave
him; a pass, but Raymond had a long
fly Cb ripht field and Bernard just beat
JJeant's throw to the plate and landed
one- which counted most of all.
Aliller was the star of the fielding
kings, "figuring in many of those hair
liheris Trom short to first and a!so in
a rapid double. Newton did the safe
met with the stick three times and
of them was a scratchy one. None
of the three errors figured in the run
Â¦ fclumn and the game progressed as
far as the sixth when Cravath com
*'rr.lttf.d tfi*e first mistake by dropping
a 4!y from the bat of I^eahj-.
The morning game was declared off
on account of the rain. This afternoon

George Nethercott's consistent grey
hound, Barge, defeated James Sween
ey's Richard Anton at Union Coursing
Park yesterday in the last of the pre
liminary trials for the Grand National
Championship stakes. It required the
fulj^ five trials to determine the win
ner. By a curious coincidence the
dog wearing the white collar won each
trial, the positions of the dogs in" the
slips being changed each time.
The greyhounds were so evenly
matched that Richard Anton led by
a slight margin in three of the runs
up the field, Barge showing in front
on two occasions.
Of the four dogs left in the stake
Pocatelli will meet Fair Tralee and
Barge will meet Rubber Ankles..
The reserve stake went to Belle
Free. The daughter of imported Fet
ter Free was the class of the stake and
experienced no difficulty in winning.
She was led to the hare but once and
that was by McVey in the first round.
After this she beat in turn Game Boy,
Gold Chain, Viking, Real Pasha, and.
in the final, Cloverdale. / There was a
strong tip out on the latter, but he was
led six lengths and was beaten by a
score of 6 to 0.

Although many of the best teams
were present at the California Tennis
Club, the handicap doubles tournament
was postponed on account of rain. Sev
eral of the teams entered In the tour
nament participated in some lively
practice matches. Ray Cornell and
Chester Smith played together for the
first time and did surprisingly well.
In a three-set match with Frank Mfccu
ell and Tracy Crawford, they beat tbÂ«
latter two sets out of three. The match
was played on even terms and the de
feat of Crawford and Mitchell wa.3 ' a
surprise. Smith and Cornell lobbed^ex
cellently and also played a fast net
game. The score was 6-3, 5-7, 6-4.
Harry Halght proved in good form.
He beat Herbert Schmidt two sets and
with Dr. Hill as a partner beat Schmidt
and Harry Rolfe four sets out of five.
C. Smith and Crawford played a fa.3t
one-set match In singles. Crawford, af
ter leading at 4-1, finally won out, 11-3.
Schmidt beat Rolfe easily. The latter
is not playinff as well as formerly and
could make no headway against his
clever partner. The scores follow:
Brabant and Foley played their beat
game in the first three sets. After win
ning the first two handily they lookeJ
tf> have the match well in hand. With
the score standing 6-5 and deuce in
favor of the losers. Gayness caught a
line ball, thinking it outside. This was.
the turning point in the match anil*
from then on things went Dunlap autl
Foley's way.
,The third set was the longest and
hardest fought of the five. After losing

are a number, of riflemen In this city
who have signified their intention of
taking part, the ranges* from now un
til the opening of the festival will, be

Adolph Strecker of the California
Schuetzen Club carried off the kingly
honors against the assembled marks
men of the world at the last competi
tion, and it is hoped a. Californian will
again be the winner? at the coming
event.
At the medal competition of the Cali
fornia Schuetzen Club yesterday.
Adolph Strecker was far ahead of his
competitors with the excellent scores of
226 and 229 in his ten-shot strings, be
ing almost 23 out of 25 rings at a dis
tance of 200 yards.
At the pistol target W. F. Blasse was
high with two scores of 91 each. John
L. Utschig was. a close second with 89
to his credit.
Several private matches were held by
members of the different clubs, the
most interesting of which was a flve
shot match between George Rischmul
ler Sr. and Philo Jacoby. Both con
testants shot well, each ending- his
score with a dead center. The result
was a tie, which will be shot off at a
future date.

day turned out warm and bright.
Many of .the yachts of the San Fran
cisco fleet were under way yesterday,
cruising out to Fort Point.
A light breeze carried the yachts out
of the cove,Â«but then a calm streak was
struck. For an hour or so the yachts
drifted here and therer A few light
airs enabled them gradually to work
their way to Alcatraz, where a good
breeze was found. After cruising along
the water front the fleet returned to
Tiburon Cove, makVig moorings about
4 o'clock in the afternoon.

FROM MANY STATES.
A large number of .addresses on
topics of interest to the trade will be
heard during the week. The conven
tion managers are looking forward to
decisive action on several matters of
general concern to retailers throughout
the United States. One of these is the
Parcels Post bill, which, as a matter
of course, the retailers oppose. Another
is the Pure Food bill' that has already
passed the lower house of Congress.
This is strongly favored, as it makes
the manufacturer .and not the dealer
liable for adulterations. Then the con
vention is exrjected to take action
looking to the enactment of uniform
legislation by the States for the better
protection of retail merchants, the gar
nishment law of Minnesota being the
ideal aimed at. It is also hoped to
perfect a mutual protective associa
tion to do for retailers what the Dun
and Bradstreet commercial agencies do
for the wholesalers in advising as to
responsibility of customers.
About 500 delegates are expected to
attend the sessions of the convention.
The convention will continue four
days, Wednesday being given up to
excursions to Asti and other points of
interests, with a special theater party
in the evening at the Chutes.

afternoon session at 2 o'clock. In the
evening a promenade concert and re
ception will be given the visitors at
the Ferry Building. *
For the first time in the history of
Methodist General Conferences women
delegates will have seats and a voice in
the direction of church affairs.
LOS ANGELES, May 1.â As the day
for the assembling of the delegates to
the thirty-first general conference of
the Methodist Episcopal church ap
proaches, general interest in this great
gathering of representative churchmen
from all parts of the civilized world
becomes hourly greater.and when Bish
op Steven Merrjll calls to order the first
session at 9 o'clock next "Wednesday
morning, 74S out of a total of 750 ac
credited delegates will be in their seats
ready to proceed with the serious leg
islative tasks confronting them.
These delegates will, during the daily
se&sions, lasting throughout the month
of May, be called upon to solve many
problems of momentous importance to
the growth and future welfare of the
Methodist Episcopal church.
In the ODinion of many high in the
councils of Methodists the quadrennial
session will prove the most important of
any in the history of the church. There
is a diversity of sentiment, however, as
to which of the many questions to be
decided is first in order of consequence.
Subjects ranging from the broad ques
tion of right and sympathy in the Rus
so-Japanese war to personal question
of whether the lowly member of de
nomination should attend theater and
play games of cards, will be discussed
and passed on.
In fact there is little of ethic interest
in life that will not be discussed.
Among th<? most important subjects arc
the following: "Is the course of the
President of the United States in con
ducting the affairs of the nation such
as may be approved by Methodism?"
'â¢What can the church do on the liquor
question?" "What action can the
chuÂ»ch take to solve the race ques
tion?" "Shall worldly pleasures such as
dancing, theater going and card play
ing be condoned by the church?" "With
which combatant in the war in the Ori
ent are our sympathies?" "What can
be done by the church to prevent in
the good name of the country the crime
of lynching?"
The subject of the American Univer
sity, in course . of construction at
Washington, D. C, is one of the big
questions that the educational commit
tee will have to decide. The institution,
as originally projected, was to have an
endowment of $5,000,000 and an agree
ment was reached at a former general
conference that the university should
not be opened until this sum should be
in hand. About $2,500,000 has been col
lected, land has been secured and sev
eral large buildings erected.
Attorney General U. S. Webb has |
rendered to the State Board of Equali
sation a long written opinion, the ef
fect of -which win be to change the
method of assessing certain railroad
property in the State of California. The
opinion has reference to the assessment
ofÂ« so-called branch lines.
The Stale Board of Equalization in
Its request for advice saj-s:
Heretofore fcome V of the branch lines â¢ of
thÂ« Southern Pacific Company have been
a*sessÂ»4 by the Slate Board and other branch
lines of the same company have been assessed
hy tne local assessor* of the several counties.
The branches In question are those short lfnea
let railway leading from the main line to borne
. point located In the same county as the point
of diversion. Some of these branch lines cÂ«rry
both jjassenicers and freight for hire, some of
them extend to sugar factories and other
plant* and are operated occasionally for the
purpose of transporting freight. They are all
fcwned by the Southern PaciHc Company
and Â©peralÂ«"d as one system; tickets may
b* purchased at any point on the entire system
entitling the holder to transportation to any
dÂ»*ired station on the eystcm; similarly, freight
may be transported from point to point over
the whole eystem; the bookkeeping of the Â«ys
tÂ«n is oenducted as a unit, and the earning
from and the expenses of the entire system are
kept in one ax-count.
The Attorney General first points out
.in his opinion that under the provisions
of section -10 of article 13 of the State
constitution "the franchise, roadway,
roadbed, rails and rolling stock of all
railroads operated in more than one
county in this State shall be assessed
by the State Board of Equalization at
their actual value." and that neither
the constitution nor the statutes of the
State make any distinction between the
main line and its branches, but that
the sole distinction is whether the rail
road is operated in more than one
county.
The debates of the constitutional con
vention are extensively cited, and the
Attorney General draws from these the
following conclusion:
â¢ That section 10 of article 13 of the State
<-nriflltution Â«** adopted for the purpose of
'obtaining Ju*t asscFsment* â just to the several
political FUbdlvlsions of the State, and just to
' the railroads. Thai the Constitutional Con
vention believed that it mas impracticable for
the franchise, roadway, roadbed, rails and

f^nwnt thereof was entrusted to local asses
*nt%, and, therefore, the assewment of said
. rmnertie* should be entrusted to a central
body havinr jurisdiction over the whole State.
That the franchise of such a railroad could
. be assessed justly only by the body having
.Â¦jurisdiction of the mileage of the entire road
la the whole ' EtAte. and also having power to
r-umine thr books, papers, and officers of the
owner. That the roadway, roadbed and rails
of such & road could not be assessed justly by
, local assessors for the reasons stated, and for
Â¦ t \- further reason that euch property has a
. \alue different than the sura of the values of
â¢ the component parts. That the rolling stock
of ruch b. road could not be assessed justly by
the local nssmors for the reason that it is
capable of being removed from the counties
where the rate of. taxation may be high and
placed, as of the date of 12 o'clock, noon, of
the first Monday in March. In any particular
year, in the county â¢where the rate of taxation
nay be lew. ,
In speakinjf of the jurisdiction of
the State Board of Equalization, the
Attorney General says:
The same authorities also Ehow that the
controlling feature is single ownership of con
â¢ nected lines, and not the particular kind of
. road, nor the purpose for which the track
is used, nor whether main line or branch line,
nor whether freight line or passenger line,
nor whether one line In one continuous direc
tion or different or circuitous directions., nor
whether used for a train once a week or" for
trains onco. an hour. The matters, last re
ferred to isay be matters .of great buslceaa
importance to the owners of a railroad but
are wholly Irrelevant as determining the juris
diction c( the assessing power.
Particular attention Is directed, by
the Attorney General to the fact that
the practice heretofore prevailing â as
indicated by the letter addressed to him
by the boardâ must necessarily have
been illegal in one respect or the other.
It being shown as a logical proposition
that the State Board of Equalization
should either *have assessed all of- the
branch lines referred to or should have
assessed none of them.
The opinion 'then takes up the his
tory of the several roads which were
purchased by and consolidated Into
the Southern Pacific Company,
and holds that by reason of such con
solidation and under the authorities:
died the moment a ' branch' line, was Â¦
connected with and became a part of
the general system of that - railroad,
1pso facto, 6uch branch line came.un

OMAHA, Neb.," May Â¦ Lâ Dr. William
T v \ Gerisch, 65 years of age, dropped
dead this ; morning ; at the bedside of
his sick -wife when the constables ap
peared to evict him from his home in
satisfaction of a- mortgage given to se
cure ' delinquent rents. Gerisch came
to Omaha a year ago from Hartington,
Nebraska, and opened a small private
hospital. Â¦ He was unsuccessful in get
ting patients and his savings were soon
exhausted. Two months ago he mort
gaged his furniture to his landlord and
yesterday : when threatened with evic
tion he pleaded for a day's delay and
tried to borrow from friends. He only
raised $150, which he carried to his
wife's bedside and handed to her. t At
this moment two constables appeared
on the scene. The old man had so far
borne up under the hope that some
how things would turn out all right,
but the sicrht of the constables was
too much for his shattered spirit. He
fell to the floor in a swoon and in a
few minutes was dead from heart
failure^ The poor man's wife, seeing
her husband's body roll over, rose from
her bed and ran screaming from the
house. Neighbors rushed to her assis
tance, but it was too, late to save her
husband. Mrs. Gerisch says that after
her husband died the constables acted
like savages. Even the very bed on
which she was lying was taken away.
The little food she had was spilled on
the floor and &ie was subjected to the
most uncivil treatment by the consta
bles. The doptor leaves a son of 18
years and a daughter 14, both of them
at work. He also carried a policy for
$2000 in the Ancient Order of United
Workmen, the payments on which had
been kept up for him by his minister.

"Tom's Wedding Gift." a melodram
atic production opened at the California
Theater last night. It is the same old
story of a wife's fall and triumph and
the usual villain and hero are promi
nent throughout the production.
George Bosworth plays the role of
the hero and Clifford Dempsey that of
the arch villain. Nevada Herron as
the heroine made quite an impression.
Lyon Osbora as the minister appeared
to advantage and the rest of the cast
did fairly well. The scenic effects of
the production are extremely good. ThÂ»*

, Hal Davis, Inez Macauley and com
pany opened at the Orpheum Â¦ yester
day afternoon in a sketch that is on
the bills as "Pals." The climax of the
act makes a decided hit. As the num
ber continues the audience is kept in an
inquisitive mood as to its finish, but
when the end comes all desires are sat
isfied and what might be termed a
thorough "rough house" is given â¢ with
a vim. A jealous husband attacks an
old college companion, who â recalls to
his wife recollections of a childhood af
fection and the quarrel begins. Mirrors
and windows are smashed, fixtures
shattered and the bill of the property

a favorite until the end of his engage
ment. The M. F. Dumond trio afford
an interesting act and their music, par
ticularly the violin selection, [la of a
high order. They are Parisian musi
cians and have come to this city from
