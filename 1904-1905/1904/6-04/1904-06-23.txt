CHICAGO, June 22.â The six dele
gates from Arizona are telling all of
the United States Senators and Con
gressmen. attending the Republican
convention that it would be a mistake
to yoke' Arizona and New Mexico in a
Statehood bill. The delegates claim
that Arizona should be given State

would refuse to ratify the action of
Congress iif the two Territories were
merged into one State. /

CHICAGO, June 22.â Entries in the

Governor Murphy of New Jersey
said: "The plank relating to Southern
representation in Congress should cause
no sensation, although perhaps It Is a
departure in Republican platforms. On
the whole, it Is good doctrine. If the
white men of the South see fit to dis
franchise the colored voter, and this
can be completely proved on Congres
sional investigation, there can be no
injustice in demanding that the South's
representation In national affairs be
based on the actual vote cast. It Is
simply .a matter of the constitution
and seeing that the constitution Is en
forced. The tariff plank In the plat
form fs also very satisfactory and is a
compromise, with a 'stand pat' lean-
Ing."
Governor' Odell of New York said:
"The tariff plank of the national plat
form could have been a little stronger
on-the revision side without any in
jury to. protection interests. On the
whole, however. I think the plank will
be found? satisfactory to all good Re
publicans.'. The Southern representa
tion plank- simply means an enforce
ment of the fourteenth. amendment to
the constitution."
In, regard to the Southern representa
tion plank Senator McComas of Mary
land said:
"It is a departure from the average
Republican platform In this respect, but
it seems to be perfectly right. It looks
like a threat; but why not, if any such
unjust -condition as disfranchlsement
exists? There is no fairness In basing
representation in Congress or the elec
toral college on a vote that never
votes."
"Perfectly satisfactory," said Repre
sentative Dalzell of Pennsylvania, the
"high priest of high protection," in
speaking of the tariff plank. "There
ought to.be no doubt that it- means
what It says, and it needs no Interpre
tation."
"That's" a good enough 'stand pat'
tariff plank for me." said Representa
tive Grosvenor of Ohio. "I like that
part of the platform relating to South
ern representation In Congress, because
it means simply an enforcement of the
fourteenth amendment to the constitu
tion â no more and no less."
Senator Dryden of New Jersey was
particularly well pleased with the tariff
plank.
"It Is satisfactory to the protection
ists of the Republican party," said he,
"and all Republicans are protection
ists."
â¢' one of the greatest importance, and
to my mind it seems that the Republi
can party is pledged to a Congressional
investigation of the Southern franchise,
and if the conditions are found such as
are reoorted from time to time there
can be no injustice in basing repre
sentation of the South in Congress and
in the Electroal College on the actual
vote cast. We Republicans in the South
believe that this question should have
been settled long ago, and I know that
in my State. Arkansas, this plank will
have a good effect."
Powell Clayton, Embassador to Mex
ico, dwelt at some length upon the
plank bearing on the Southern vote,
because he has given to this question a
great deal of study.
"I consider, that plank," said Clayton,
"That's a very good tariff plank."
said Senator Allison, "now that it is
changed apparently to the satisfaction
of all concerned."
Senator Fairbanks, who will be nomi
nated for Vice . President to-morrow,
expressed himself as extremely pleased
with the platform, but did not want to
be quoted. He said every feature was
satisfactory, especially that relating to
the tariff.

The full significance of pledges for

Visitors were not so early about the

choice for second place on the ticket.
It exceeded in enthusiasm the ovation
ol the first day.
The announcement of the permanent
organization for the convention start
ed the continuous demonstration which
followed ithe introduction of Sneaker
Cannon fls permanent chairman.
In addition to the tariff plank and
other features which always have had
a prominent position in Republican
platforms there were incorporated sev
eral clauses of striking Interest. One
of these is a plank looking to the re
duction of the representation of certain
Southern States in the Electoral Col
lege and in Congress. It is built 'upon
what Is known as the "Payne resolu
tion," offered eight years ago, and the
Quay resolution, offered four years ago,
hut roes further than either. The plank
directs an Investigation to ascertain
â¢whether there have been unconstitu
tional dlsfranchisements of voters In
cny State, and if so demands a reduc
tion of the representation of such
States in Congress, with the conse
quent reduction In the Electoral "College
and In national conventions.
The report of the committee on cre
dentials interested the convention only
!Â»o far as it dealt with the Wisconsin
situation. /
One of the remarkable features con
cerning the adoption of the platform
â¢was the fact that It has been the sub
ject of administrative scrutiny and na
tional Interest for many weeks, and
â¢was accepted without a dissenting
vote. i
The party enthusiasm aroused by the
hearty reception given "Uncle Joe"
Cannon, as he is known from coast to
coast, spread even to the routine busi
ness and culminated in a contest over
the number of delegates to which Ha
waii was entitled. The conflict was the
first and doubtless will be the last on
the floor of the convention.
The second day of the convention
might have been the close bad It been
the desire of the assembled delegates.
Early in the day a movement was in
stituted to proceed with the nomina
tions, but the original programme,
Â¦which was prepared to extend over
three days, prevailed, and the standard,
bearers fox the l?04 Republican cam
paign will be named formally to-mor

From ih*> standpoint of political im-
I'tirtan^e th*> adoption of the platform
was the pvent of the day. It contained
â¢declarations of party policy that are to
form the basis of much of the oratory
in the coming campaign. But the per
manent chairman's personality almost
overshadowed the platform.

From the moment he was escorted to

thusiasm, which had lain dormant,
burst forth and the applause rang true
and hearty. He made a speech, and the

or Interview shook his head, smiled
amiably and replied: I
"I have come to Chicago on the invi

L desire to discuss business affairs."
This was all the next chairman of the
next national committee would aay. He
appeared to be in fine health and ex
cellent spirits. His friends declared
that he was prepared â¢ to " direct the
Roosevelt campaign,- and asserted that
they had no doubt that he would prove
his merit In this position as he has in
other places of responsibility.
Cortelyou later In the evening met
Vice Chairman Henry C. Payne of the
national committee. Senator Depew,
Mr. Root,' Graeme Stewart, Frank Low

Fairbanks expressed his appreciation

to express their regard for the man
that had been agreed upon to carry,
with Mr. Roosevelt, the Republican
party to victory next November and to
assure him that he had their undivided
support.
The voice of a Califomlan was heard
on the floor of the convention for the
first time to-day. It was Judge Mc-
Kinley of Los Angeles, chairman of
the California delegation, that gave
the convention its initial impression of
the eloquence of the West. H- took
the floor in defense of the delegation
from Hawaii, which had been allowed
two votes, though six of the Islanders
journeyed hither, in obedience to call,
under the impression that each would
be allowed a vote.
Foraker of Ohio had moved to allow
Hawaii its entire representation and
McKinley rose to second the motion.
He pointed to the fact that the cation
owed its fullest support to the colony
of Americans far out in the Pacific, and
that California, as its nearest friend.
would stand and battle for Its rights.
He trusted that the claim that but few
whites dwelt in the Islands would not
prejudice the convention, for, he said,
all of their people had been brought
under the flag and the convention
should consider the question of num
bers, not of color.

CALL UPON" FAIRBANKS.
McKIXLEY MAKES A SPEECH.
The foregoing is the opinion of
Frank H. Short of Fresno on the pro
visions of the platform adopted by the
Republican National Convention that
are of greater interest to California
than the many others contained in the
announcement of the party's policy.
Short represented California en tha
committee of platform and resolu
tions and it was partly due to his ener
getic efforts that these principles were
so plainly set forth.
The plank pertaining to the en
couraging and upbuilding of the mer
chant marine -win stimulate the in
vestigations of the Congressional com
mittee that has announced its inten
tion to sit in San Francisco from July
15 to July 20 and longer if necessary.
HEADQUARTERS CALIFORNIA
DELEGATION. CHICAGO. Jane 22. â
"The Republican platform accepted
to-day is especially satisfactory to the
Pacific Coast. It declares in favor of
the reclamation of the arid lands and
for" a continuation of that policy. It
asserts Chinese exclusion to be a- Re
publican policy, to which it pledges
adherence. U makes protection the
cardinal policy and favors reciprocity
only when not inconsistent with the
principles of protection. It ia un
qualified in Its indorsement of the
isthmian canal project and promises
the speedy construction of the great
waterway.
"In fact, if California had had the
preparation of the platform under her
exclusive control it could not have
been made much more satisfactory.
The declaration of the platform on
the question of capital and labor is
brief, clear and perfectly plain and
ought to satisfy the reasonable de
mands of both. The enforcement of
the law against all and in favor of all
is a good doctrine to tie to."

and, when Major General Corbin goes
to the Philippines In October, he saW:
"If the command of the Atlantic di
vision is offered to me I would express

Further than this General MacAr
thur had nothing to say.
As to whether, as was rumored, he
had received a personal intimation
from General Chaffee that the Atlantic
division was open to him he was non
committal.
General MacArthur's desire to re
main in this department, from what
can be learned, is based on two rea
sons. He thinks this division of mor^i
Importance than that of the Eastern
side, and he also has become greatly
attached to this coast and its people.
Furthermore, General MacArthur has 1
nothing to gain by the change. Ac
cording to the general routine of army
promotion, General Chaffee will retire
on April 14, 190tJ, and will be succeeded
by General Corbin, who will retire on

Shortridge had made a bad break and
came to his rescue, saying: "I do not
think Mr. Shortridge intended to- make
that remark. We concede nothing of
the sort." 6hortridge did not attempt
to clear himself, however, and his
statement stands. ' r

PORTLAND, Or., June 22.â Officer
Goltz in the municipal court this morn
ing, by direction of ' Judge Hogue,
choked Gus Danguisse in order that
Danguisse should know what treatment
he might expect in the Police Court if
he further tormented, .his wife, Marie
Danguisse.
Yesterday Danguisse, who had been
on a spree for some' time, went io a
grading camp at Alberta street and
Rodney avenue, where his wife cooks
for the graders, and choked her several
times, telling her that he intended to
kill her. She begged him to spare her
for the sake of their children. The hus
band allowed her to go, but a short
time afterward he secured a tent stake
and tried to hit her on the head. He
told her to say her prayers as her time
had come. The woman ran and hid in
the woods close to the camp, and finally
told her story to Officer Adams, who
took the husband to Jail.
Judge Hogue sentenced Danguisse to
thirty days in the City Jail, and then
told him that if he again abused his
wife he would be choked by the police.
Officer Goltz then gave him an example
of what he might expect.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Attorney Shortridge followed in the
same strain. After quoting the case of
the man who fraudulently sold one box
of red pills, he stated that the defense
would not claim that Jacob Eppinger
made representations recklessly or in
advertently, but that he had never
made them at all. "The point at Issue,"
he said, "is, Did Eppinger make these
representations?. We claim he did not
and leave it to the defense to prove
otherwise. Any acts of the defendant
prior to April 14, or any transaction
with parties aside from. Colonel Beck,
are not admissible In evidence."
,, The , prosecution, then had an
jnning 'and * District ; Attorney ' By-
Ington began reading from United
States .Supreme .Court decisions ~ to
offset, the red pill case. Among
other ' points he. showed that ** "In
the case of 4 a man accused of passing
counterfeit coin the testimony need not
be confined to the particular coin, but
evidence showing that he made a prac
tice of "passing the queer" might be in
troduced to Influence the Jury. This,
argued the District Attorney, paral-
During the course of the argument
Attorney Peter F. Dunne outlined the
defense, -which,' according: to his state
ment, will be conducted on different
lines than those previously suggested.
''We will contend," he said "that Jacob
Eppinger did not send tne warehouse
receipts to Colonel Beck of the Inter
national Banking Corporation and did
not make any false representations re
garding the wheat in the warehouse.
This will be our defense and it will
makes offenses similar to that with
which the defendant is charged Inad
missible."
IiIXE OF DEFENSE.
The question raised is a vital one,
and the entire day was occupied in
arguing, the Jury being excused until
a decision shall be rendered. The pros
e.cutlon wishes to introduce evidence
to show that Jacob Eppinger was
guilty of fraud not only In the cases
on which he was Indicted, but also on
numerous occasions Immediately pre
ceding the alleged fraudulent transac
tion. The defense, on the other hand,
contends that the accused can only be
tried on the offenses charged in the In
dictment and that otner transactions
may not be used to Influence the minds
of the jurors. Many authorities were
quoted on both contentions and the
opinions of courts of sovereign States
were pitted against each other to such
an extent that the words "sovereign
States" became the signal for laughter.
According to the statement of Attor
ney, Shortrldge, one of the counsel for
the defense of Jacob Epplnger, a vital
point in the case revolves around, a lit
tle box of red pills pold In Indiana
some years ago. The prosecution cm
the other hand contends that the In
diana Superior Court took unwarranted
liberties inasmuch as It reversed a
â¢United States Supreme Court decision
when it rendered its decision regarding
the sale of nostrums guaranteed^ to al
leviate all ills of womankind.
â¢ They were sent to ranches last
summer, where they were em
ployed in "berry picking and cur
ing prunes and hop picking. One
section of the lads alone earned
$138, while another party picked over
2-jO tons of prunes and brought back
over $500 In money as the proceeds of
their healthful and manly labor.
The society has adopted a plan of de
ducting from the earnings of each boy
a sum per day sufficient in the aggre
gate to cover the cost of the expedition.
An accurate account is kept of each
boy's earnings, and this amount, Ies3
the deduction named, is paid to him
upon hist discharge from the institu
tion or is expended for his benefit or
paid to his legal guardian.
Fifty-four per cent of, the gross
earnings of the boys was paid to them
and 46 per cent absorbed in expenses.
In this manner, says Mr. Lewis, the
society intends to teach the value of
good, honest work.
Thrs annual meeting of the Boys'
and Girls' Aid Society was held on
Tuesday, when the board listened to
the . annual . report of Superintendent
Herbert W. Lewis, which especially set
forth the year's work with the boys. He
told of the wonderful benefits of the
Bummer outing given the boys of the
Institution this summer.

Special DlFpatch to The Call
SANTA CRUZ, June 22.â The nomi
nation Of officers pave new life to to
day's session of the Grand Grove of
Druids and much rivalry was evinced
throughout the meeting.
The steamships Garonne and Olympia
were not sighted. Conservative esti
mates place the w'inter clean-up .at
Nome and vicinity at $1,000,000. James
Wood is reported as having taken out
more than $150,000, which will be
shipped to Seattle *on one of the next
boats out. The steamship Roanoke,
due to sail from Nome for Seattle
about June 23, will have another large
gold shipment, and it is thought that
the steamers Senator and Victoria will
also have gold cargoes. Marshall Rich
ards has twelve prisoners for McNeils
Island. The men were to be sent out
on the Oregon, but were delayed..
Residents of Nome reported to the
officers of the Oregon that the winter
had been extremely mild, with very
little snow. The place, was remarkably
free from sickness. Notwithstanding
that heretofore Nome has not been
classified as a winter digging district
Major Strong, of the Nome Nugget,
is authority for the statement that the
dumps l&ken. out last winter have to
date produced a sum in excess of
$1,000,000, and the work now remains
incomplete on account of a shortage
of water. ;
Nothing was seen of the Northern
Commercial Company's steamship Sa
die. The Roanoke was reported as hav
ing reached St. Michael. The steam
ship Tacoma reached Nome the morn
ing of June 13, and the steamships Vic
toria and Senator followed the same
afternoon.
SEATTLE. June 22.â After bucking
heavy ice Hoes in Bering Sea that for a
time threatened to drive the vessel back
to Dutch Harbor, the steamer Oregon
reached port early this morning from
Nome, establishing a record for being
the flrfct vessel back from the cold-
Ilelds this season and making a quick
round triu. The Oregon brought four
passengers and $500,000 in bullion.
The steamer Corwin, which sailed
from Seattle May 17, was the first ves
sel to reach Nome. The evening of
June 8 the Corwin arrived in sight of
that place. : .
Fears are felt for the Alaska Com
mercial Company's steamship Port
land. It was the general opinion at
Nome when the Oregon sailed that the'
vessel had been caught in the ice and
carried far into the Arctic Ocean. L_ast
season the Portland was imprisoned in
the ice for fourteen days. The vessel
was one of the first to reach Dutch
Harbor, and should have been in Nome
ahead of the Corwin.

women of Northern California, died at
her home In Crescent City on June 16
at the age of 68 years.
Mrs. Breen was bori. in St. Johns,
Newfoundland. Her maiden name was
Margaret M. Lacy and she was mar
ried to John Breen In the city of Bos

same year. In 1881 Mr. and Mrs. Breen
with their family moved to Crescent
City, where they have since resided. A
kind and loving wife, a devoted mother,
a true friend, has been called to rest.
She was a good Christian and the only
monument she desired was her con
sciousness of having done good to her
fellow creatures. She took the bitter
cup of life as it was presented, tem
pered bv the hand of a wise Provi
dence, thankful for the good, patient
for the evil and never Inquiring why
the latter predominates. Kind,
thoughtful and gentle to the end, she
quietly, peacefully passed over tha
dark river away out upon the endless,

preceded her, leaving to mourn her
death a beloved husband and three de

tien claim to have seen on one oc
casion three horsemen appear on a
hill, one of whom, according to a
Russian officer, resembling either an
American or British attache, fell from
his horse when the Russians fired and
was evidently killed.
From a reliable source it Is report
ed that the Japanese in the vicinity of
Port Arthur are now entirely inactive
and that the Russians are not con
cerned regarding the situation there,
that in the north being now the most
important factor.
The Japanese fleet is probably co
operating with General Oku's advance
along the coast.
Heavy rains have been falling since
June 16 and have hampered opera

though possibly for a month or more
it will be dry in the north.
It is presumed that General Oku is
now advancing to the north by the
way of Fuchau and the coast road,

Facing the plaza is the famous old
Castro mansion and JtLe barracks of
the gay soldiers of the time of Carlos
III. full of color and rich ro.nance.
It was here that Helen Hunt Jackson
went, bent upon laying the scene of
"Ramona" In the sleepy village of San
Juan. But a misunderstanding led th3
chipper old lady â Mrs. Flynn by name,
she who guards the old Castro home â
to impugn the motives or the loved
writer, and the negotiations ended.
Else would San Juan Bautista to-day
be famous and the crop of Ramonas
nearer home. For which -later service
we may be, thankful, for there are Hara
enough among us now.
Senator Joseph R. Knowland. presi
dent of the league, who has done more
for the safeguarding of the landmarks
of the State than any other Califor
nlan. will go down on Friday, if lt.be
possible that he can leave town, ac
companied by a party of Interested
friends, who will be earnest spectators
of this quaint ceremony of a century's
standing.
After the church service a Mexican
dinner will be spread in the plaza, or
if the sun be too hot in the rambling
rooms off the corridor. And at night
the gultara will tinkle and the dance
be on.
When to-morrow's sun rises over the
gables of the Gabilans and looks down
over the valley of the San Benlto, pil
grimages will have been begun from
every village and farmhouse in the
country round about, wending their
way over the gray roads that thread
the valley, focusing In the great plaza
of ojd San Juan. To-morrow will be
San Juan's day â San Juan Bautista's â
and in the blessed old mission reared in
his honor when the West was young
will a fascinating service be held. And
for days past old Father Closa, almost
a relic himself of the pastoral days,
will don the vestments brought into
the country a century ago by Junlpero
Serra and chant the mass that for 107
years has been sung on this day and on
this spot uninterruptedly.
It wav one hundred and seven years
ago on June 24 that the first pilgrim
age was made into- the valley of the
San Benlto by a motley crowd of sol
diers, muleteers and Indians, under the
guidance of Padres Lasuen, Martiarena
and Catala.
Under the shade of a spreading oak
tree a temporary shrine was erected,
a crude cross thrust -into the poppy
field and a trio of bells flung over the
branches of a neighboring oak tree.
In this Bimple fashion the mission was
established and named in honor of San
Juan, whose natal day it was.
A few months later a temporary
chapel of wood was erected, with a.
mud roof, which In 1800 was replaced
with the fine old structure whose tile
covered corridor is to-day a thing of
beauty.
It is in this old sanctuary flooded with
memories of the past that Father Closa
will chant the service of the church and
tell in his soft CastUian tones the story
of the day. And his hearersâ many of
whom were baptized by him, and their
children's children likewise â foregather
here, partly In honor of the old priest
who for forty years has stood at his
post in the deserted village. When he
passes well they know that the old
sanctuary will no longer be the scene
of weekly serviceâ the village being too
poor to- yield support to a successor.
For forty years, when the winter
rains are threatening, the old padre
has clambered up into the attic of his
loved church and with his own hands
patched holes that the passing year,
had made. But now he's old â far too
old for climbing: and for heavy labor.
But last year saw him at his annual
tour over the roof. There was no one
else to do it â no one else who cared.
But the Landmarks League has
hopes of taking from the old friar his
hea\'y burden that the mission may not
suffer as did its sister missions farther
south. But when? The public alone
can solve that.

Secretary Hay suspecting, as does
Admiral Chadwick, that the Sultan is

mince words. He instructed Consul
Gumraerc at Tangier to inform the Sul
tan that the United States wanted
â¢â¢Perdicaris alive or Raissouli dead,"
and that -without too much delay. The
continued presence of the American
r.f^t is a sort of "nuff sed" addition to
this curt message.
Admiral Chadwick makes no mention
ct holding a force in readiness to land.
<_>n the contrary he advises against any
forcible demonstration at this moment.
He evidently believes such action would
only increase the prevailing unrest
ashore. It is supposed the Sultan's
laxity is due to some political Intrigue.

Washington Officials Think
That Moorish Ruler Is
Acting in Bad Faith and
Send Him Sharp Message
When he perceived that Hudspeth
was familiar with the case Thomas
grew suspicious and beat a, hasty re
treat from the shooting gallery. Huds
peth followed him down Grant avenue
and at the corner of Geary street Tie
met Patrolmen Brady and Duffy and
related the strange tale to them.
The policemen arrested Thomas and
took him to the City Prison. There he
gave the name of George Clare, and
later that of Henry Clay. When first
arrested he said he was John Thomas
of Seattle and that he had never been
in Denver in his life.
He was closely questioned at the City
Prison, but gave an evasive answer to
every interrogation, refusing to tell
where he came from or where he re
sided. When the mention of the murder
of the two policemen in Denver was
made the prisoner grew deathly pale
and became nervous, clutching at the
iron railing for support.
His name was placed on the detinue
book and he will be held until the local
police communicate with the Denver
authorities and find out further facts
regarding the case. The prisoner is
supposed to be either the man who did
the shooting or else a "pal" of one
Llewellyn, who was a noted bad man
of Denver at the time the crime was
committed and who the police authori
ties believed firedthe fatal shot.- - < -
Thomas is a man between 35 and 40
years old. He is about 6 feet 9 inches
in height and weighs about 190 pounds.
He wears a mustache and his
hair is of the same hue. He looks like
a typical criminal and his manner de
notes the bad man. His face bears a
dissipated look Rnd from all appear
ances he is a degenerate whom the
casual observer would pick out for a
criminal at first sight.
The mysterious and brutal murder
of Patrolmen Griffin and Griffiths by
notorious thugs in Denver in 1898 may
be cleared up in this city by the arrest
last evening of one John Thomas, alias
George Clare, alias Henry Clay.
Thomas let drop some remarks
in a shooting gallerv which were over
heard by James Hudspeth, a negro, and
were reported to the police.
The story is a strange one and savors
of an old-time detective plot. The ne
gro was in a shooting gallery on Grant
avenue, near Geary street, and hap
pened to make several bullseyes.
Thomas was standing near by and
casually remarked that "the negro was
a good shot.
"Yeir, I shoot very well at times,"
said Hudspeth.
"Well, that may be." said Thomas,
"but you are not a marker to an old
pal of mine. He dropped two coppers
in Denver one night and it waa a
pretty piece of work."
This statement was so bold and came
with such suddenness that Hudspeth
was interested. He was a resident of
Denver at the time and knew the facts
of the case thoroughly. He gradually
drew Thomas into conversation, and
the latter made some startling admis
sions.
NEGOTIATIONS ARE
NOT SATISFACTORY
The men responded heartily.
The general also addressed the regi
ments which especially distinguished
themselves in the recent lighting, and
presented the St. George's cross to 250
officers and men who, were drawn up
on the platform of the railroad station

hearty send-off.
Kuropatkin stood on the steps of his

The reports of the Japanese treat
ment of prisoners and wounded are
marked by extraordinary contradic
tions. ' ; â¢ *
In some cases the greatest kindness
has been shown to the Russians, i but
from elsewhere come reports of bru
tality and worse. One case is cited
in which the Japanese during the
fighting, seeing the Russian wounded
on the field, sent Chinese bearers and
had them removed to a hospital.
KAICHOU, Liaotung Peninsula, June

A number of men missing after the

TOKIO, June 22.â A division of the
army under General Oku occupied
Hsiungyaicheng, twenty-five miles
southwest of Kaiting, yesterday with
out opposition.
ST. PETERSBURG, June 22.â The
imminence of a battle in the northern
part of the Liaotung peninsula is ad
mitted by the War Office.
The week of skirmishing around Siu
yen retarded General Kuroki's opera
tions, permitting General Stakelberg to
reach Kaiplng, the rear guards Blowly
falling back on Senucben before the
Japanese advance.
Meanwhile large forces are hurrying
south from Liaoyang to check both
General Oku and General Kuroki.
It Is believed here that General Ku
ropatkin's object is to prevent a Junc
ture of the Japanese armies. On the
other hand, the aim of the Japanese*
apparently Is to drive the Russians out
of the Liaotung peninsula preparatory
to a march on Liaoyang. The approach
of the rainy season will more than
likely precipitate matters.
Nothing is known officially of the re
ported occupation of Hsiungyaicheng
(Hslungyaochenz or Slyoungcheng) by
Japanese. If the report should be cor
rect it agrees substantially with the
Japanese plan of advance as it Is un
derstood here, but it indicates that the
Japanese outposts are farther forward
than Russian advices indicate.
The Russian rear guard is now at
Seuchen. General Kuroki's advance
along the roads from Siuyen, leading
respectively to Halcheng, Tachechou
and Kaichou, is being warmly contest
ed by General Kuropatkin's outposts.
The column heading for Kaichou Is the
farthest advanced, but is still thirty
miles distant. General Kuroki's move
ments betray a tendency to go south
and Join General Oku. Kuroki's out
posts are fortifying the pass between
Saimatsza and Kwandianslan.

woman was removed to the Central
Emergency Hospital in the ambulance
and Dr. Boskowitz put forth every en
deavor to save her life.
All his efforts, however, were futile,
and the young woman died at 1:30
this morning.
Mrs. Pence was the daughter of Au
gustus Williams, a well-known coal
dealer at 1133 Mission street. She had
been married four years and is a partic
larly attractive woman. She had often
spoken of ending her life for no appar
ent reason and every publication of
self-destruction in the newspapers
seemed to prey upon her mind. After
the suicide of Mollle Gordon, with
whom Mrs. Pence was very Intimate,
she continually dwelt upon the subject.
According to the husband there was no
marital infelicity and their . domestic
life was most happy.

follows: â¢
"That the representation from Ha
waii shall be two delegates, provided
that this shall not impair the right and
privilege of the delegates already seat
ed In this convention."
On this the first roll call of the con
vention occurred." Senator Foraker
moved to amend the substitute by In
cluding in it Alaska, Arizona and New
Mexico. The motion was not enter
tained, as the roll call had been or
dered.
There was considerable confusion on
the floor and the chairman rapped
vainly for order.
"It's the delegates who are making
the noise," was called out to the chair
man.
"All right," responded Mr. Cannon,
"I guess the delegates can have dis
order as long as they want It."
When Illinois was reached Senator
Cullom requested that it be passed, as
the delegation was somewhat divided.
After a few States had voted Illinois
announced that It was ready with 34
votes for the substitute and 20 against.
As Senator Cullom announced the vote
the band In the gallery, getting a wrong
cue from fome source, commenced to
play, to the great amusement of the
Delegate McKinley of California fa
vored the Foraker amendment in a
brief speech.
Chairman Bingham explained that
the 'Hawaiian question was seriously
considered by the committee. The
Alaskan delegation had been increased
from four to six because Alaska had
been, represented in national conven
tions for many years, and, besides, had
poured many millions of gold into the
country. In defense of the committee
he maintained that it had acted in ab
solute fairness. At this the six eagle
capped totem poles of the Alaska dele
gation went Into the air and the dele
gation let off a round of cheers.
BINGHAM'S SUBSTITUTE.
Mr. Babcock withdrew In favor of
Senator Foraker, who took the plat
form.
It was now too late, he said, to say
that this change was making a pre
cedent. Hawaii was a Territory; the
other Territories had six delegates, and
Hawaii was as Justly entitled to. six
delegates as the other Territories.
When the convention was called it
would be then time to change the rep
resentation if it is deemed desirable.
Representative Babcock followed.* He
stated as a member of the committed
on rules that all six of the Hawaiian
delegates had been seated in the con
vention and given two votes. Porto
Rico had been treated in like manner.
If the convention was to seriously con
sider the amendment he proposed to
offer anotherâ to grant the District of
Columbia six delegates and also to
increase the representation of Wis
consin.
""" Senator Hopkins was recognized in
opposition to the amendment. He cau
tioned the convention not to be carried
away with enthusiasm on this occa
sion. He had as much admiration for
Hawaii as any one, but the people
there should receive no better treat
ment, in his judgment, than the people
of Illinois or New York. The islands
have a population of only 150.000 people,
and .to adopt the amendment would be
to give them a larger representation
than in the States. He would prefer
cutting down the representation from
the Territories to increasing them. The
time might come. If a precedent were
established toward Increasing the rep
resentation, when the Territories might
dictate the candidate for the Presi
dency.
Representative Babcock of Wiscon
sin was recognized, although Senator
Foraker of Ohio and J. W. McKinley
of California were demanding to be
heard.
"Gentlemen of the convention of the
Republican party," he said, "there
seems to be an impression on the part
of some that Hawaii is not a Terri
tory. I wish to call their attention to
the fact that Hawaii Is on the map of
the United States and is now one of
its possessions. God grant the occa
sion may not arise, but if war comes
in the Pacific the Sandwich Islands
will be necessary to the American
people, and Hawaii will not be found
wanting."
OPPOSES AMENDMENT.
Senator Foraker suggested that Gov
ernor Carter of Hawaii, who was on
the platform, be heard from. With
some excitement Governor Carter
dashed to the front of the platform.
Many delegates began leavincr the
hall after Mr. Cannon's speech. Finally
Mr. Cannon rapped for order and called
for the report of the committee on
rules, which was presented by General
Bingham. General Bingham, (n pre
senting the report, stated that the
committee >ad adopted the rules of the
Fifty-eighth Congress, when not Incon
sistent with the rules of the conven
tion.
At the suggestion of Senator Cullom
of Illinois the reading of the report
was discontinued.
Senator Foraker of Ohio offered the
following amendment:
"Resolved, That the report of the
committee on rules be amended so as
to allow six delegates ' from Hawaii
with six votes in co-formity with her
sister Territories of Arizona, New
Mexico, Oklahoma, Indian Territory
and Alaska."
As Cannon uttered the words "good
by" at the close of his address tht del
egates rose, cheered and waved hats,
flags and handkerchiefs. The chairman
paid but little heed to the applause
after one bow as he closed, but return
ing quickly to his seat entered upon
the "work of the convention. The band
played "The Star Spangled Banner,"
the delegates and spectators rising.
There was a stay In the proceedings
after the close of Mr. Cannon's speech,
while Mr. Root and others on the plat
form crowded around the chairman to
thank him for his speech. Mr. Cannon
remained apparently oblivious to the
demonstration. The band drifted into
a medley of popular airs, the cheering
stopped and there was a hiatus of some
minutes.
A hearing more quiet, but equally
flattering, was given Mr. Cannon when
he entered upon the solid matter of his
address.
cheer cut him oft for a full minute,
and then he was allowed to proceed. ;
Lautrtiter greeted him as he said:
"For the first time In my Mfe I have
written enough sentences at'pne time
to make 2500 words to say to Â£ou to
day. I tried hard to commit it to mem
ory, but I cannot- Now." he" continued,
"we vrill begin to ramble."
CANNON PROVOKES APPLAUSE.
We have extended widely our foreign markets, and we
believe in the adoption of all practicable, methods for
their further extension, Â¦ including commercial reciprocity
wherever reciprocal arrangements can be effected, . con
sistent with the. principles of protection without injury to
American agriculture, American labor or any American
industry.
We helleve it to be the duty of the Republican party to
uphoklf the gold standard and the integrity and'value of
our national currency. ' The maintenance of the gold
standard, established by the Republican party, cannot
safely be committed to the Democratic party, which re
sisted Its adoption and has never given any proof since
that time of belief In it. or fidelity to It.
TO. UPBUILD- THE MERCHANT MARINE.
While every other 'industry has prospered under the
fostering aid of Republican legislation, American ship
ping engaged In foreign trade , In competition with the
low cost Qf construction, low wages and heavy subsidies
of foreign governments, has not for many years received
from the Government of the United States adequate en
couragement of any kind. We therefore favor legislation
which will encourage and build up the American mer
chant marine and we cordially approve the legislation
of the last Congress which created the Merchant Marine
Commission to Investigate and report- upon this subjest.
A navy powerful enough to defend the United States
against any attack, to uphold tfce" Monroe doctrine and
to watch over our commerce is essential to the safety
and the welfare of the American people. To maintain
such a navy is the fixed policy of the Republican Â»party.
t We cordially approve the attitude of President Roose
velt and Congress in regard to the exclusion of Chinese
labor and promise a continuance of the Republican pol
icy in that direction.
The civil service law was placed on the statute books
by the Republican partyT which has always sustained It,
and we renew our former declarations that it shall be
thoroughly and honestly enforced. '-
We are always mindful of the country's debt to the
soldiers and sailors of the United States, and we" believe
in making ample provision for them and In the liberal
administration of the tension laws.
We favor the peaceful settlement of international dif
ficulties by arbitration.
PROTECTION OP AMERICANS ABROAD.
We commend the vigorous efforts made by the admin
istration to protect American citizens in foreign lands
and pledge ourselves to insist upon the Just and equal
protection of all our citizens abroad. It Is the unques
tioned duty of the Government to procure for all our
' citizens, without distinction, the rights of travel and so
journ in friendly countries, and we declare ourselves in
favor of all proper efforts tending to that end.
Our great interests and our growing commerce In the
Orient render the condition of China of high importance
to the United States. We cordially commend the policy
-pursued in that direction by the administrations of Pres
ident McKinley and President Roosevelt.
We favor such Congressional action as shall determine
whether, by special discrimination, the elective franchise
in any State has been unconstitutionally limited and, if
such is the case, we demand that representation in Con
gress and In the electoral college shall be proportionately
reduced, as directed by the constitution of the United
States. . â¢Â¦
RIGHTS OF CAPITAL AND LABOR.
Combinations of capital and of labor are the results
of the economic movement of the age, but. neither must
be permitted to infringe upon the rights and interests of
the people. Such combinations, when lawfully formed
for lawful purposes, are alike entitled to the protection
of the laws, but both are subject to the laws and neither
can be permitted. to break them.
<The great, statesman and patriotic American, William
McKinley. who was re-elected by the Republican party
to the Presidency four years ago, was assassinated Just
at the' threshold of his second term. The entire nation
mourned his untimely death and did that Justice to his
great qualities of mind and character which history will
confirm and repeat.
The American people were fortunate in his successor,
to whom they turned with a trust and confidence which
have been fully Justified. President Roosevelt brought
to the great responsibilities thus sadly forced upon him
a clear head, a brave heart, an earnest patriotism and
high Ideals of public duty and public Bervlce. True to the
principles of the Republican party, he also/showed him
self ready for every emergency and has met new and
vital questions with ability and with success.
The confidence of the people in his Justice, Inspired by
his public career, enabled him to render personally an In
estimable service to the country by bringing about a set
tlement of the coal strike, which threatened such dis
astrous results at the opening of the winter of 1902.
MONROE DOCTRINE VINDICATED.
Our foreign policy under his administration has not
only been able, vigorous and dignified, but in the highest
degree successful. The complicated questions which
arose in Venezuela were settled in such a way by Pres
ident Roosevelt that the Monroe doctrine was signally
vindicated and the cause of /peace and arbitration greatly
advanced. .
His prompt and vigorous action In Panama, which we
commend in the highest terms, not only secured to us
the canal route, but avoided foreign complications which
might have been of a very serious character. He has
continued the policy of President McKinley in the Ori
ent and our position In China, signalized by our recent
commercial treaty with that empire, has never been so
high.
He secured the tribunal by which the vexed and peril
ous question of the Alaskan boundary was finally set
tled. ,
. Whenever crimes against humanity have been perpe
trated which have shocked our people his protest has
been made and our good offices have been tendered, but
always with due regard to International obligations.
Under his guidance we find ourselves at peace with
all the world and never were more respected or our
wishes more regarded by foreign nations.
DOMESTIC POLICY EQUALLY SOUND.
Pre-eminently successful In regard to our foreign re
lations, he has been equally fortunate In dealing with
domestic questions. The country has known that the
public credit and the national currency were absolutely
safe in the hands of his administration. In the enforce
ment of the laws ' he has shown not only courage, but
the wisdom which understands that to permit laws to be
violated or disregarded opens the door to anarchy, while
the Just enforcement of the law Is the soundest con
servatism. He hiuf held firmly to the fundamental Amer
ican doctrine that all men must obey the law, that there
may be no distinction between rich and poor, between
strong and weak, but that Justice and equal protection
under the law must be secured to every citizen, without
regard to race, creed or condition.
\ His administration has .been thorough, vigorous and
honorable, high-minded and patriotic. We commend it
without reservation to the considerate Judgment of the
American people.

KEITH GETS JUDGMENT FOR
. UNPAID BILLS OF EXCHANGE
Suit Against Schwartz, Lowe A Co.
Decided hi Plaintiffs Favor for
Full Amount.
A Judgment for the plajntlff In the
sum of $19,206 73 was rendered yes
terday by Judge Seawell in the case
of Minor C. Keith against Ansel M.
Eastern, Samuel Schwartz. William
Schwartz and L. Leon Lowe, doing
business as Schwartz. Lowe & Co. In
San Francisco and Costa Rica, Central
America.
Keith contended that he had given the
sum named in the course of two years
to the defendants at their place of
business at the city of San Jose, Costa
Rica. He had received bills of ex
change payable by the firm in New
York and the first one for $3000 was
transferred to Iloadley & Co. and the
National Park Bank at New York, but
upon demand the defendants refused
payment on it. Between November
5, 1S98, and November 12, four more
bills of exchange were received by him
in the. sums of $5000, $3000, $3960
and $4246 73 and none of these was
paid.
Keith sued the firm of Schwartz.
Lowe & Co., who answered that the
partnership in Costa Rica had been
dissolved in June, 1897. and while the
members named were doing a business
together, it was only a casual partner
ship and no partnership liabilities
were created. They alleged that L.
Leon Lowe was their manager In Cos
ta Rica and that the bills of exchange
were delivered by him without their
knowledge or consent. At the time of
the dissolution of partnership the
debts of the concern were, it was said,
assumed by L. L. Lowe and A. M.
Easton and Lowe later made a settle
ment with his creditors. The court
holds that the firm is responsible for
the unpaid bills of exchange which
were drawn in the firm's name.

The Supervisors' Street Committee
yesterday began an investigation of
the complaint of property owners that
Gray Brothers are excavating Tele

Green, in violation "of their promise
not to do so. George Gray appeared
before the committee, and said there
was no blasting or quarrying being
done, but that some rock was beinir
taken from their own property with
pick and shovel. Testimony was given
that a house was being undermined
by the excavation. As Gray had been
notified only half an hour before the
meeting, the Inquiry was postponed
for one week on Gray's assurance that
all digging on the hill will be discon
tinued until then.

But this work cannot safely be committed, to any other
hands than those of the Republican partju To intrust it
to the Democratic party Is to invite disaster. Whether,
as in 1892, the Democratic party declared the protection
law unconstitutional, or whether it demands tariff reform
or tariff revision, its real object Is always the destruction
of the protective system.
However specious the name, the purpose is ever the
same. A Democratic tariff has always been followed by
business adversity; a Republican tariff by business pros-'
perity. To a Republican Congreis and -a Republican
President this great question can be safely intrusted.
When the only free trade country among the great na
tions agitated a return to protection the chief protective
country should not falter In maintaining it.
In this record of achievement during, the last eight
years may be read the pledges which the Republican
party has fulfilled. We propose to continue this prin
ciple and 'we declare our constant adherence to the fol
lowing principles: .
Protection which guards and develops our industries
is a cardinal policy of the Republican party.- The meas
ure of protection should always at least equal the dif
ference in the cost of production at home and abroad.
We insist upon the maintenance of the principles of pro
tection, and, therefore, rates of duty should be readjusted
only when conditions have so changed that the public in
terest demands their alteration.
Our administration df the great departments of the
Government has been honest and efficient and wherever
wrong has been discovered the Republican administra
tion has not hesitated to probe the evil and bring the
offenders to Justice, without regard to party or political
ties. Laws enacted by the Republican party, which the
Democratic party failed to enforce and which were In
tended for the protection of the public against the un
just discrimination or the Illegal encroachment of. vast
aggregations of capital, have been fearlessly enforced
by a Republican President and new laws insuring re
sponsible publicity as to the operation of great corpora
tions and providing additional remedies for the preven
tion of discrimination in freight rates have been passed
by a Republcan Congress.
, RECORD OP PLEDGES FULFILLED.
The possession of a route for an isthmian canal, so
long the dream of American statesmanship, is now an
accomplished fact. The great work of connecting the
Pacific and the Atlantic oceans by a canal Is at last be
gun and it is due to the Republican party. ' .
We have passed laws which will bring the arid lands
of the United States within the area of cultivation.
We have reorganized the army and put it in the high
est state of efficiency.
We have passed laws for the improvement and sup
port of the militia.
We have pushed forward the building of the navy, the
defense and the protection of our honor and our inter
ests. \ â¢ .
ISTHMIAN CANAL NOW UNDER WAY.
The public credit, which had been so lowered that in
time of peace a Democratic administration made large
loans at extravagant rates of interest In order to pay
current expenditures, rose under Republican administra
tion to Its highest point and enabled us to borrow at 2
per cent, even in time of war.
We refused to palter longer with the miseries of Cuba.
We fought a quick and vigorous war with Spain. We
set Cuba free, governed the island for three years and
then gave It to the Cuban people with order restored,
with ample revenues, with education and public health
established, frge from: debt and connected with the United
States by provisions 'for. our mutual, interests.
We have organized the government of Porto Rico and
its people now enjoy peace, freedom, order and pros-"
perity, " . , , . " ,
In the Philippines we have suppressed Insurrection, es
tablished order and given to life and property a security
never before known there. We have organized civil gov
ernment, made it effective and strong in administration
and have conferred upon the people of those islands the
largest civil liberty they have ever enjoyed.
By our possssion of the Philippines we were enabled
to take prompt and effective action In the relief of the
legations at Peking and a. decisive part In preventing the
partition and preserving the Integrity of China.
We firmly established the gold standard, which was
then menaced with destruction. Confidence returned to
business, and, with confidence, an unexampled prosperity.
For deficient revenues, supplemented by improvident
issues of. bonds, we gave the country an Income which
pr6duced a large surplus and which enabled us, only
four years after the Spanish war had closed, to remove
over one hundred millions of annual war taxes, red#ce
the public debt and lower the interest charges of the
Government.
We met these unhappy conditions vigorously, effective
ly and alone. We replaced a Democratic tariff law, based
on free trade principles and garnished with sectional pro
tection, by a protective tariff, and Industry, freed from
oppression and stimulated by the encouragement of wise
laws, has expanded to a degree never before known, has
conquered new markets and has created a volume of ex?"
ports which has surpassed imagination. Under the Ding
ley tariff labor has been fully emplO3 r ed, wages have risen
and all industries have revived and prospered.
GOLD STANDARD FIRMLY ESTABLISHED.
We then found the country, after four years of Dem
ocratic rule, in evil plight, oppressed with misfortune and
doubtful of the future. Public credit had been lowered,
the revenues were declining, the debt was growing, the
administration attitude toward Spain wan feeble and
mortifying, the standard of values was threatened and
uncertain, labor was crippled, business was sunk in the
depression which had succeeded the panic of 1893, hope
was faint and confidence was gone.
The Republican party entered upon Its present period
of complete supremacy in 1897. We have every right to
congratulate ourselves upon the work since then--ac
complished, for it has added luster even to the tradi
tions of the party which carried the Government through
the storms of the Civil War. â¢
PARTY RECORDS ARE COMPARED.
Fifty years ago the Republican party came Into ex
istence, dedicated among other purposes to the great task
of arresting the extension of human slavery* In 1860 it
elected its first President. During twenty-four . of the
forty-four years which have elapsed since the election of
Lincoln the Republican party has held complete con
trol of the Government. For eighteen more of the forty
four years it has held partial control, through the pos
session of one or two branches of the Government/while
the Democratic party during the same period has had
complete control for only two years. This long tenure
of power by the Republican party Is not flue to chance.
It is a demonstration that the Republican party has com
manded the confidence of the American people for near
ly two generations to a degree never equaled in our his
tory and has displayed a high capacity for rule. and gov
ernment which has been made even more "conspicuous
by the Incapacity and infirmity of purpose shown by its
opponents.
When finally there was a chance for
Mr. Root's voice to be heard he pre
sented Mr. Cannon to the convention as
a man who presided over the greatest
legislative body in the world, "with a
grip so strong, a mind so clear and a
heart so sound that he would wield the
gavel In that body for many years to
come." Another shout went up as Mr.
Root stepped back and Mr. Cannon
stood alone, facing the audience.
As Mr. Cannon turned to the front of
the platform to 'commence his spe?ch
there was another chorus of cheers
and loud cries of "Cannon: "he's all
right!" Then came the usual query of
"Who's all right?" and the ringing an
swer, "Cannon!"
The chairman waited patiently for
the. applause to subside and then, it
being comparatively quiet, said:
"Gentlemen "
That was as far as he went. Another
At 12:22 p. m. Temporary Chairman
Hoot rapped for order, directing the
delegates to take their seats and order
ing the aisles cleared. This latter order
was not obeyed with sufficient celerity
to please the chairman, and he directed
the assistant Eergeant-at-anns to see
that the aisles were cleared. A Eecond
specific direction from the chairman
brought the convention to order.
Chairman Root then introduced Rev.
Thomas E. Cox of the Holy Name
Cathedral of Chicago, who delivered
the invocation.
The report of the committee on cre
dentials was read and adopted by a
viva voce vote.
Senator FoTaker moved that General
Osterhaus. a distinguished German
veteran of the Union army, be given a
scat. The motion was unanimously
adopted and the chair appointed Sena
tor Foraker of Ohio and General Bing
ham of Pennsylvania a committee to
escort General Osterhaus to the plat
form.
At this moment the convention burst
into applause as General Osterhaus
Â¦was escorted to the platform. Chair
man Root presented him to the con
vention as "Major General Osterhaus,
corps commander of Sherman." The
general made a brief speech, which was
listened to with interest. General Os
terhaus said:
"Permit me to- thank you most hear
tily for the courtesy which permits me
to appear before you. I was present at
the Republican Conventions in 1560 and
1S64, when Abraham Lincoln was nomi
nated, and I bespeak ror the nominee
of this convention the same glorious
success.** Â»
The chairman then called for the
report of the comnMttee on permanent
organization.
Chairman W. M. Johnson of this
committee advanced to the platform
end read it.
The announcement that Speaker Jo
eeph G. Cannon had been selected for
permanent chairman of the convention
provoked enthusiastic applause.
On motion of Senator Cullom the re
port was adopted.
WARM WELCOME FOR CANNON.
Chairman Root appointed ex-Secre
tary John D. Long, Senator Cullom and
Representative Burton of Ohio a com
mittee to escort Speaker Cannon to the
platform. Upon this announcement the
convention gave a mighty, spontaneous
shout, and when Mr. Cannon appeared
at the speaker's desk and Chairman
Root took him by the hand and led him
forward to the extreme front of the
platform the climax of enthusiasm was
reached. Delegates with one accord
Jumped to their feet and on their
chairs. Cheer after cheer went up and
waves of sound swept over the throng.
The applause continued as the tempo
rary and permanent chairmen contin
ued to stand arm in arm waiting for
silence.
Mr. Root raised his hand for silence.
The cheers went on without cessation
or diminution. Twice more Mr. Root
raised his hand for silence that was
not forthcoming. The delegates were
on their chairs and their enthusiasm
could not be checked.
Mr. Cannon appeared decidedly un
comfortable while the cheering went
on, and shifted about as though the
floor underneath him was hot.
ROOT RAPS FOR ORDER.
CONVENTION HALL. CHICAGO.
June 22.â Although the doors of the hall
v ere opened a half-hour later than yes
terday, for the first twenty-five minute/i
after 11 o'clock the band played to a
rpriBkling of gallery spectators only. A
sea of brown-backed chairs in the gal
lery and mezzanine was broken only
by an occasional dot of black or the
bright Ei>ot of. a woman's gown. Groups
of eergeants-at-arms stood Idly about,
and In the delegates' section a half
dozen men leaned back and read the
morning papers.
It was Just noon when Mr. Root as
cended the platform, which he reached
by the rear entrance. Screened by the
groups of convention officers and oth
ers, he was not seen by the crowd. Yes
terday a huge bunch of pink peonies
graced the chairman's table, but to-day
a. euperb cluster of American Beauty
roses stood ready to greet Mr. Cannon
when he assumed the chair.
The hum cf conversation as the Coli-
Fcum gradually filled had not been
broken by enthusiasm of any charac
ter for some lime. The aisles in the pit
were crowded with standing delegates,
only a portion of their seats being oc
cupled. when at noon the New York
Senators and Governor Odell threaded
their way down the center aisle. A
cheer went up, and the galleries facing
i he main entrance began to applaud.
This had hardly died out when the tall
figure of Senator Fairbanks of Indiana
was caught 6lght of coming down the
aisle to the left. A hearty cheer went
up in that section of the hall. Dele
gates at once sprang to their feet and
more cheers were given. As the Sen
ator reached his 6eat in the Indiana
delegation reservation the ovation was
renewed.
Chairman of the National Committee
Payne. Temporary Chairman Root and
Senator Lodge of the resolutions com
mittee, with the platform in his inside
pocket, held an informal conference on
the platform. Everything for the day's
programme in the way of committee
reports was in readiness. Another shout
was heard to the left, and the pictur
esque Alaskan delegation, with their
totem poles mounted with American
eagles, marched in and took their seats.
At 12:15 o'clock the playing of the
national air brought the assemblage to
its feet. Flags were whipped out in va
rious parts of the hall and waved in
time with the music. Meanwhile the
gallery seats were being taken to a
greater extent than on the day pre
vious.

tury Is to bring" more of good or evil to the

brought.* Under what party . banner .will you

Under that of the people who sit still or tear
down? Or will you take service with the party
ft Lincoln and Grant and Garfleld and Harri
"on and McKInley and Roosevelt' and help us

UNDER WHICH BANNER?
It you approve of them, If you approve of
the Republican policies, you are short-sighted
if you refuse a working majority in the House
of Representatives, because you cannot keep
a Republican House without it., . y
Do you like the Senate of the X'nited States?
It Is a condition that cannot be changed in
November. It could be changed at the end of

Theodore Roosevelt? Yes. Stronger than his

Now, then, you know under our form of
government the party In power Is held respon
sible. The function of the minority is to put
It on good behavior by being ever ready to ap
peal to the ptople. l^et me tell you something.
If our government has a fault It Is that after
an election one party is sometimes placed In
power with . only one leg. It may have the
Senate: it may have the Presidency; It may
have the House. It goes along on crutches.
Yet you want to hold it responsible for public
sentiment. If I had the power I would so
change our constitution that at every quadrl
entilnl election the party that received the
popular approval should go fully Into power and
let thp public have a government according to
the sentiment expressed at the ' ballot box.
But we have not got it arranged quite that
wey.
A few wordt more and I will conclude. Our
Government is for the people. It Is divided
Into co-ordlnÂ»te branches â the Judges of the

to give George A. Knight opportunity

The Democratic National Convention
will assemble at St. Louis on the semi
centennial anniversary of. the Republi
can party. Perhaps the significance of
the anniversary was not taken into ac
count when the Democratic National
Committee designated that time, but,
nevertheless, the Democrats will meet
on that historic day. The California
delegation to the St. Louis convention
will leave San Francisco next Tuesday.
At Los Angeles arrangements have
already been made for a great ban
quet at Hazzard's Pavilion. The tables
will be spread to accommodate 1000
guests. The number of acceptances
registered indicates that the demand
for places, will exceed the pavilion
space.

from our great leader and our great President

man standing by the bedside who under the
constitution was his successor, and he there
said, "Lam to be President, to carry out the
policies of the Republican party, and I will

To your coming President great things have

great question is settled by the conscience and

Well, under the constitution of the United
States he has a right to. .Â» Let them ask what
is going to become r>f the Philippines; At least
we have peace; at least we have growing civil
government, and as our 80,000,000 In this
twentieth century shall Increase to 250,000,000.
as we shall go on with production and com
merce, in the fullness of time that territory
will be useful to the United States, whereas
in the meantime we will be like a benediction
to them.
The United States ia great in production
and wealth â how great Is our wealth? In
1STÂ»O f300 In round numbers was the per capita
wealth. In 1H00 $1235 was the per capita
wealth. In 1SÂ«O the wealth was measured
by sixteen billion dollars, in 1900 nln*ty-four
billions now a hundred billions. Great Britain
has only an aggregate of wealth of sixty bil
lions, and she has been living and gathering
It for the last five hundred years, yet In a
generation we sprang from sixteen to one
hundred billions. The world's wealth is four
hundred billions of dollars. The United States
has one-fourth of It.
Hut our frlendu the enemy, some of them
little politicians, vex the air crying "Trusts,
trusts." Oh, they come out strong with good
lungs as trust busters. Since 1830 have they
ever done any busting? Oh, no. There is
no Jericho now, and if there was it would
never happen again that people would march
about the walls blowing ramshorns sÂ»ven
times until the walls fell down. That Is what
the Democrats are trying to do. Trusts?
Yes. Great combinations of capital against
public policy? Yes. But the Republican party,
always true to the people and its traditions,
made haste to provide under the constitution
legislation that would- prohibit these com
binations. . ,
The do-something party! It slept under
Cleveland. McKInley had the war with Spain
and the restoration of prosperity, but that
young enthusiastic, true man took an oath
to see' to it that the laws were executed and
has executed the law. And in his opinion
trusts are unlawful and should be dissolved.
That Is the difference between the Democrats
and Republicans. One bursts by wind, the
other by law.
NO COUNTRY SO RICH
There is no country on earth that has so
much wealth as ours. Why. Interest In

the United States to-day commands money at
a premium at 2 per cent, which Is 1 per cent
lower than any other nation on earth can com

while these great wealth seeking individuals,
desiring favorable investments month by month
and year by year, enterprising citizens desiring
gain, found additional industries. Take the cen
sus of 1000. The figures are correctly tabu
lated and made accordng to the facts and the
census of 1900 shows that from the establish
ments of the so-called trtsts in. the United
States only 14 per cent of the factory product
came, whereas 86 per cent of the factory prod
uct came from their competitorsâ individuals
and small ownerships'. And It is bound to bo
that way, if you will stop and think.

"Oh," said a distinguished colleague follow
ing the astute Senator Gorman, "if we come
into power, while protection is robbery we will
say to you that we will Journey In the direc
tion of free trade, but we will not destroy
your Industries over night."
Great God, think of It! They won't kill you
outright, but they will starve you to death
day by day. They want to he on guard to
protect the people who are dwelling In peace
and prosperity under a Republican policy.
It reminds me of the fable of Aesop. You
know the record In one of his fables that the
wolves said to the sheei^"diecharge the dogs"
â who were their natural protectors â "and em
ploy us and we will take care of you." Does
the capital of this country and the labor of this
country want to be under the care of the wolf
Gorman and the wolf Williams and their fel
lows? I do not think so. What a country
this is. And, Republicans, we have got to out
line the policy and lead the people In caring
for It. Why, we are like the women; we not
only have to take care of ourselves, but more,
as one of our women said, we have to take care
of the men. The Republican party not only
has to care for Itself, but has to care for the
minority by a wl6e policy. How has It been
doing It? We preserved the Union under the
policy and leadership of this party. Do you
recollect that the opposition party, on a de
mand for an armistice and negotiation and
compromise, nominated McClellan In 1864 and
moved heaven and earth to defeat Lincoln?
Do you recollect when the constitutional amend
ments were submitted they said nay, nay,
and then, after they, were adopted, the Demo
crats came Into power temporarily In
Indiana and Ohio they passed acts taking
buck the assent of the States. When the first
battle was fought against greenback money
back in the seventies, out In the Middle West,
whatever they were on the Atlantic coast,
they were flatists In the West. From step to
Â«tep through all these forty-four years, where,
if you measure time by advance, we have
lived two centuries as compared with any
other period of the world* Â¦ history.- they have
pulled back, pulled back, and. when we ac
complished â and It Is not necessary to march
forward and try to accomplish again â they
move into our old quarters and squat down
there and make fHcee and Â»ay, "You are going
to eend the country to hell."
They are trying to convince the people that
they ought to come Into power under the lead
of Gormap In the Senate and Williams in thÂ«
Houee. They have been trying, to give the
country Dover's powderr.
DROPS INTO FABLE.
Oh, well, aren't they going to change? Let
us see. Just before the close of thÂ« laÂ«t Con
gress New York's eloquent son, Bourke Cock
ran, a member of the House of Representa
tives, got the floor and he preached an old
fashioned Democratic sermon, free trade and
all that kind of thing, and he did it well, and
there came from the minority side of the
House, without exception, such cheering and
crying and hurrahing and applauding as I
never witnessed before In that House, because
at last they had - the pure Democratic faith
delivered to them.
The Republican party is a national party
and believes In diversification of our indus
tries and the protection of American capital
and American labor as against the cheaper
labor elsewhere on earth. What <lo the other
people believe in? For sixty years went out
the cry of free trade throughout the world.
free ships upon the sea. On other questions
a tariff for revenue only. The free trade party
has always denounced the Republican policy
of protection as robbery, and whenever clothed
with power, whatever Its pretenses, it had
thrust a dagger into the very heart of pro
tection.
Great heavens, the Republican party from
18t>0 until this moment moves onâ does what
good common sense dictates and the country
grows to It.
How is It now? We have reduced' postal
rates over one-half since 1860 on the average.
I.tLÂ«t year the postal revenues were $131,000,000
as against $$.000,000 in I860. Keep that in
your mind â S1U4.COO.OOO. And th? whole serv
ice only cost S138.0OO.CO0. We had a deficit
of $4,000,000â3 per cent, and we would not
have had that deficit had it not been, under
the lead of the Republican party looking out
for the welfare of all the people and con
ducting the Government from a business stand
point under the lead of McKInley. followed by
Roosevelt, there was established free rural
deliver}' that cost $10,000,000.
â¢ ight and a half million dollars. Keep that
in your minds â eight and a half million dol
lars. How much do you suppose it cost to
run the department? Nineteen million. It
took aJI the revenue and as much more and
one-quarter as much more from the treasury
to pay for that postal service. Why. gentle
men, the city postofflee of Chicago lsÂ»*t year
collected more revenue by almost one million
of dollars than was collected by the whole
department In the United State* In 1S60.

ceremony anil later enjoyed the elaborate mar

picture, red carnations and tulle and a large
basket of white sweetpeas occupying the cen
ter of the big round table.
Mr. Mendenhall is one of Oakland's best
known attorneys and is unusually popular In

The Â»i JdinK at the Hatch home on Harri
son street was a really charming affair, and
the bride hersrlf was rotxd In one of the hand
somest (towns ?e-n this year. It was of lace
of an exauUlte tuittrni. The drop skirts of
taffeta and cblffun each had a dozen or more
ttny ruffles around the edee, giving a filmy
fluffy eflVct. The full bodice was finished with
a wide belt, and tiny bows of white panne vel
vet and long accordion pleatlngs of chiffon gave
a graceful finish to the elbuw sleeves. The veil
wa* fahtened with lilles-of-the-valley, and the
bridal bouquet was a shower of the IlIUs also.
Mrs. Georg* Humphreys, as matron of honor,
in a beautiful gown of white chiffon, recalled
to mind the day not long ago when she her-
F'lf was a bride. Hbe carried this evening a
great bunch of scarlet carnations. The groom
was attended by his brother, M. A. Menden

In 1003 I came to New York and shortly
afterward went to Chicago, where I graduated
from the South Division High School. After
leaving school I studied for two years at the
New York School of Acting and then took &
teacher's course in English with Miss Laugh
ton, principal of the School of English Speech

since lived at the Glasgow, 106 Kills street.
MONEY IN T STAR-GAZING.
Immediately after my father's death my
mother removed to Haiti, where she. married
a German planter named Otto Steinberg, and
It was from my stepfather that I received the
name Julius Steinberg. Some of -my step
father's relatives now own the Steinberg fruit
ranch near Walla Walla, In the State of
Washington. .
During the time that my father was the
ruler of the Province of Labore he presented
to Queen Victoria the famous diamond, the
Kohlnoor, which Is the largest of the crown
jewels of Greut Britain. After his banishment
he demanded that the stone be returned to
him, but this was refused. After his recon
ciliation with the British Government the
crown allowed my father $.100,000 a year during
his life.
HIS FATHER AND 'VICTORIA.
OAKLAND, June 22.â If the wonder
ful story told by Julius Steinberg is
true, a Prince of the royal blood of In
dia is detained in the Alameda County
Jail awaiting trial before the Superior
Court on a charge of" grand larceny.
Steinberg, . who is unmistakably of
Hindoo parentage, claims that he is the
son of the late Prince Singh, former
Maharajah of the province of Lahore,
India, who was banished from his'na
tive land after the last mutiny for in
citing the natives to rebel against Brit
ish rule. Steinberg says that through
his father he is also a Prince of the
royal blood, his full title being Prince
Ramina Aramancha Singh. He says
that after the death, of his father in
Paris, in 1892, his mother married a
German by the name of Otto Steinberg,
who bestowed upon him the name of
Julius Steinberg.
The accused man Is well educated,
and in his apartments at the Glasgow,
105 Ellis street, San Francisco, is a
rare collection of Indian curios. Stein
berg is also the possessor of an excel
lent library, including a number of
standard' works on Indian history.
CLAIMS ROYAL ANCESTRY.
Steinberg told the following story to
day:
My father was Prince Singh. Maharajah of
the Province of Lahore in the interior of
India, and after the last uprising of the natives
he was banished from India for Inciting mu
tiny against the Hi-iiuh (Jovernment. When
my father- left India he went to Alexandria,
In Egypt, anri It. was there that he married
my mother, who was of mixed Egyptian and
German blood. Before his marriage my
father embraced Christianity, becoming a
Romsn Catholic, and when I was born I was
christened and baptized In the Catholic faith.
I was christened Kamlna Aramancha, and
bore that name until my mother's second mar
riage.
Aft?r a residence of several years In Alex
andria, my father and mother removed to
Paris, and while there my father petitioned
the British Government for permission to re
turn to India. This was refused, but after a
time permission was granted him to live
anywhere under the British flag except In
India, where he was forbidden to go on pain
of death. Despite the edict of the Government,
my father returned to India, endeavored to In
duce the natives to rlsa one* more against the
English, but they were satisfied with British
rule and refused. Soon afterward my father
returned to Purl?, where he died In 1892.

tannot change the ordinance regulat

for a long time that Engineer C. L.
Huggins had been collecting a large
amount of money in fees for street
work, but that it was powerless to
mtke the change until his term of of
fice expired. At least, that is the ad
vice that Town Attorney Hayne gave
the Trustees. As Huggins* term of
office does not expire until next April
no change can be made until then.
The office will then become elective,
according to a decision of the voters
in amending the charter at the last
election, and some reasonable salary
will be given to the engineer, probably
$3000 a year. Huggins' gross income
Ust year was J 10,000. out of which
he says he had to disburse J4000 for

Professor Frederick J. Turner, the
foremost of American writers of his
tory, arrived in Berkeley to-day from
the University of Wisconsin, having
come to give a course in American his
tory at th* summer session at the
University of California. Professor
Turner is accompanied by his wife.
This is their first visit to California.
Professor Henry Morse Stephens of the
history department of the university
met them upon their arrival and intro
duced them to the university.
The courses of Professor Turner will
be confined to American history. These
will include lectures on "The Begin
nings of the West." "The Teaching of
American History" and "The Diplo
matic History of Washington's Admin
istration." In the first course he will
deal with the movements of the popu
lation of the United States from the
Atlantic Coast toward the West up to
1850. In the course on the teaching of
history he will address himself to
teachers particularly. The course deal-
Ing with the diplomacy of Washing
ton's time is designed for advanced
students only.
"I hope that I shall not have such
another experience here as I had at
Harvard when I gave this course in
'The' Beginnings of the West,* said
Professor Turner this afternoon. "The
students there thought It would be
something like Teddy Roosevelt's story
of the 'Winning of the West,' with In
dian fights and cowboys and Buffalo
Bills In the foreground. Some 80O ap
plied for admission to the course, but
we had to turn them off by making
certain restrictions."

The trouble arose over the fact that
Arada engaged his brother to help him
repair the roofs of the buildings at the
Emeryville racetrack. He collected un
ion wages for his brother, but main
tained that his brother was only doing
helper's work. The union warned him
and then fined him, first $11 and after
ward $25, for persisting in retaining his
brother in the position. Arada then de
manded that his brother be allowed to
join the union. This was denied, and*
he then demanded the money back he
had paid in fines. This was returned
and he was expelled from the union.
He found that he was then unable to
get work and began an action to get
back into the union again.
Shinglers' Union No. 1 of this city
has been ordered by the Superior Court
to reinstate an expelled member. A
writ of mandate directed to the union
and its secretary by Judge Ogden this
afternoon commands, it to rescind its
action expelling Thomas Arada from
the organization. The Judge held that
there Is no provision in the constitu
tion and by-laws of the union provid
ing for such expulsion.
The order is the result of an action
begun by Arada against the union to
ti tnpel it to reinstate him to member
ship. The trial has consumed several
days, and the testimony developed the
fact that Arada had been a member
of the union and had been expelled be
cause he had employed his non-union
brother to help him.
The question whether the work per
formed by Fillmore Arada. the brother,
was such work as the union had Juris
diction over was not a matter the court
took into consideration. Judge Ogden
based his decision upon a review of
the proceedings of the union in regard
to the expulsion of the member. An
examination of the constitution failed
to show that there was any provision
for the expelling of a member for em
ploying non-union workmen. Had there
been such a provision, Judge Ogden
said, the union would have had the
right to expel him.

They were taken to the home of Mrs.
Charles Mellln of 1721 Alcatraz avenue,
where they had been visiting. A physi
cian dressed their injuries. The child's
right leg was severely crushed, but not
broken. Mrs. Maguire lives at, 424*4
Shotwell street, San Francisco. Re
garding the accident, she said:
"I saw the cars coming together, but
it did not seem possible that the motor
men would let them come into collis
ion. It is so clear at the crossing that
there was no need for it. It was a
great piece of carelessness."
Motorman Huckstable said he
thought he had the right of way and
sent his car ahead because he had
counted on the other man stopping.
WOUNDED CAKED FOR.
Neither motorman checked his car
as he approached the crossing and the
result was the Inevitable smash, the
cars striking each other at the con
verging corners of their front ends.
Mrs. Maguire and her daughter were
sitting on the front end of the Alca
traz-avenue car, outside. They were
almost directly in line of the Tele
graph-avenue car's approach â¢ and it
seemed that they would be crushed to
death. But the cars, striking together
on their corners, saved them. Both
mother and. child were thrown heavily
to the ground.
The clash occurred at 6:30 o'clock.
Car No. 52 of the Alcatraz-avenue line,
in charge of Motorman H. J. Hucksta
ble and Conductor J. H.' Eslick. was
moving toward Lorin station, when car
No. 195 of the Telegraph-avenue line,
handled by Motorman Charles O. Dai
ley and Conductor Hotaling, was going
toward Berkeley.
A HEAVY CLASH.
BERKELEY. June 22.â Two cars of
the Oakland Transit Consolidated col
lided this evening at Alcatraz and Tel
egraph avenues. They were full of pas
sengers, but all escaped injury with the
exception of Mrs. Frank Maguh-e and
her daughter Phyllis Maguire, aged 6
years, both oLwhom received severe
cuts and bruises. The escape of the
mother and daughter was marvelous,
as they were in a position that exposed
them to the full force of the contact.
Thd tracks are clear of obstructions
where they cross at the Intersection of
the two avenues, and the men in
charge could see the streets on all
sides for a block. Each motorman
says his car had the right of way and
that the other should have stopped at
the crossing.
The pair started toward the factory
together. Waite insists that as they
entered the shadow of the building he
was suddenly struck by Gonzales. who
had turned quickly upon his compan
ion and knocked him senseless. Waite's
garments were rifled. Then a policeman
found him Just as he recovered con
sciousness and Waite related his story.
Gonzales is about 24 years old, six feet
tall and very slender.
H. R. Waite of 29 Rausch street. San
Francisco, informed the police this
morning that he had been sandbagged
by Frank Gonzales, proprietor of a
Saratoga chip factory, and robbed of
$25. Waite claims that Gonzales lured
him to a lonely spot near Second and
Harrison streets last night and sud
denly assailed him with the sandbag.
Waite had been invited to come to
Oakland by Gonzales that they might
discuss Waite's proposal to buy the
factory. . The visitor arrived at 11
o'clock,, according to agreement, and
went to the chip establishment, there
meeting Gonzales.

?v TO WHOM IT MAT CONCERN: A year and
tnree months ago I was attacked with that
terrible Oisease, locomotor ataxla. Power to
Balance, stand, or even sit down, entirely lost.
Two best doctors of San Francisco and Hot
Springs. Ark., failed to help me. My stom-
ach, bowels and kidneys failed to work. I bad
catarrh cf stomach, head, and bladder as a re-
sult of the disease: theae troubles becamo
chronic. At times my heart would beat like a
arum, my *y es grew weak, my memory bad.
TJ nerves wrecked. Three months ago I went
to Tuscan Springs. What happened since was
a pleasant surprise to me. Drank tbÂ» waters,
took the baths â after three weeks' treatment
stomach, bowels, bladder and kidneys la per-
fect condition, eyesight perfect, nervousness
gone, memory good. After three months' treat-
ment, walked without a cane, with eyei closed
and up and down steep hills; am cured of this
dread disease, now walk wtth slight limp.
Have run stores In seventeen towns of thÂ»
State of CalUornia; am well known In down-

Sir Donald bad at one time a great
fondness for taking distinguished peo

1S90 Gladstone was his companion for a
fortnight In a cruise around Scotland
in the Grantully Castle, after Illness
had compelled him to take a respite
from Parliamentary work. On that
voyage Gladstone's favorite book, his
host relates, was "David Copperfleld."
Three years later both Gladstone and
Tennyson were his guests on a longer
cruise, which extended round Scotland
to Kirk wall, Norway and Copenhagen.
"It was most charming," cays Sir
Donald, "to see Gladstone' and Tennyr

read one of his poems to the great
statesman, discussing here and there
the various lines, and Gladstone ques

Those who witnessed the coronation
procession will doubtless recollect a
email group of copper-colored soldiers
with bare legs and outstanding hair,
innocent of covering. These strange
people â Fijians â and their ancient cer
emony of Vilavilairevo, or fire walking,
were the subjects of a paper read by
W. L. Allerdyce, C. M. G., at a meet
ing of the Royal Colonial Institute re
cently. Admiral Sir N. Bowden-Smith
presided.
The ceremony of fire walking, Mr.
Allerdyce explained, is performed by a
certain tribe at the island of Bega, and
originated in a legend that; in reward
for having spared the life of a man he
had dug out of the ground, one Tui
Qualita was invested with the power
of being able to walk over red-hot
Etones without being burned. An earth
oven is made and filled with layers of
wood and stone. In this a fire is kin
dled about twelve hours before the fire
walking takes place, and when the hot
stones have been exposed by brushing
away the charcoal the natives, under
the direction of a master of ceremo
nies, walk over them barefooted.
The temperature at the edge of the
oven Is about 120 degrees Fahrenheit,
while on one occasion, when a ther
mometer was suspended over the
stones, it registered 282 degrees, and
the solder was melted. Yet, stated Mr.
Allerdyce, after the ceremony the na
tives showed no signs of the terrific or
deal through which they had gone. By
means of a number of views the lec
turer gave a realistic idea of the cere
mony as performed nowadays.
Vice Admiral Lewis Beaumont de
scribed a fire- walking ceremony as wit
nessed by himself. Although those who
took part In it showed no signs of dis
comfort, he remarked that apparently
they did not like it very much.
Replying to questions, Mr. Allerdyce
said the only explanation he could give
of the apparent immunity from harm
following on the process was that the
6oles of the feet of the natives were
hardened to an unusual degree through
constant walking on a sandy soil cov
ering coral, which became exceedingly
hot under the sun. There was also the
element of absolute belief by the na-'
tlves in the legend that they were

THE recent conference held at Sacramento by the
commercial and promotion bodies of the State of
California was unique in being the first gathering
of the kind in one harmonious whole of representatives
from every section of the State come together in a com
mon cause. It needs no argument to establish the fact
that the meeting will be productive of great good. That
such action has not been taken long before this is proba
bly because of the mistaken idea that our widely diversi
fied interests could have little in common, situated as
they are more or less remote from each other in different
parts of an Ifrnmense territory.
The fealty which should exist between the different
parts of a State should he of the same kind as the pa
triotism which binds that State to the Union. With us,
whenever that fealty and mutuality of interest has not
been recognized by any part of the State so zealous in
its local partisanship as to*- forget there are others there
has been felt the sting of criticism, which has tended to
widen the breach rather than to close it.
The Sacramentd meeting illustrates the fact that all
California has come to realize the interest of one is best
promoted by furthering the interests of all and that in
stead of pulling in opposite directions more can be ac
complished for the individual if all work together in a
.common cause. In doing that in an intelligent way all
sections are. protected, more intending settlers are
reached and directed to the locality best adapted to the
wants of each, there is no longer a duplication .of effort,
a better and more neighborly feeling is generated, and
the results are more commensurate with the thought,
time and money expended.
There were representative men atUhe conference from
about 140 organizations in this State. The questions
discussed were of a character to enable those present to
better understand the objects to be attained. The ap
pointment of a publicity committee, composed of one
representative from each of the nine natural divisions of
the State, to plan an advertising campaign and report
such plan when completed to every development organ
ization in California; will tend to bring matters into
tangible shape.
The conference at the State Capitol was California's
Hague Tribunal, to adjust differences not appealable to
any particular court, to bring about perpetual peace
and to promote and develop the interests of all clients
appealing. to it. It was a sane move and one that it is
to be hoped will be even more successful in results than
the most sanguine have expected.
THE SACRAMENTO CONFERENCE.
A Japanese statesman, high in authority and close in
the confidence of the Mikado, made the astounding
statement recently that Japan would not look unkindly
upon overtures for mediation in her war with Russia.
This admission from such a source fairly bristles with
potentialities of distress for the island kingdom. The
Czar stands to-day humiliated* before the world. A few
more defeats can add no more sackcloth and ashes and
many thousands of lives must be given to death before
the great conflict is either interrupted or ended.

Sir Donald has a town residence at 4
Hyde Park place, and among his art
treasures there are more Turners than
can be found in any other private col
lection. His country residence is
Garth Castle, near Aberfedy, Scotland,
and there he keeps his Tennyson pipe.
On this occasion Sir Donald obtained
one of his most cherished possessions â
one of Tennyson's clay pipes. After
the dinner Tennyson had retired to his
cabin for a smoke, where Sir Donald
hunted him up and conveyed to him the
request of the assembled royalties that
he would be so kind and obliging as to
read to them some of his poems. The
poet was loth to lay aside his pipe,
even for that, but by Scotch persisten*
cy Sir. Donald got him to give it up,
and Tennyson, instead of tossing it out
of the cabin window, as he was accus
tomed to do with his clays after a
smoke, gave it to Sir Donald aa a
keepsake.
"When I told Gladstone this," relates
Sir Donald, "he said, 'Keep it; it will
be precious some day.'.' 1 S
When Gladstone returned to England
after this voyage he got a wigging
from his royal mistress. Queen Victo
ria, a grreat stickler for etiquette and
all the prerogatives of her exalted po
sition as everybody knows, because he
had dared to put foot on a foreign
shore without having- first obtained her
permission, which, as Prime Minister,
he ought to have done. And, as Mr.
Morley records in his biography of the
statesman, he had to make a -most
humble apology to the Queen,f6r hav
ing ignored her authority.
Sir Donld's reminiscences of this sort
make one's mouth water for more of
them. By doing thoroughly everything
he set his hand to he has earned well
merited distinction, but if he were only
a Boswell, by giving us a record of
these rapturous monologues of the poet

his ships have been forgotten.
It was on this voyage of the Pem

homage to genius, a banquet being giv

were present the King and Queen of

THE Republican National Convention was properly
introduced to the work it has in hand by the speech
of the temporary chairman, ex-Secretary Root. The
Republican party was founded by a small band of men
who dealt with an issue that had grown upon the country
from the day that John Quincy Adams made his speech
in the House in defense of the right of petition.
The extension* of slavery grew to be an absorbing
issue. I It outgrew all questions of tariff' and finance.
When the Whig party died and was succeeded in some
parts of the country by the Know Nothing party it was
seen by kindred spirits that had been apart in "the Whig
and Democratic parties that a useful national organiza
tion could not be founded upon the principle of reli
gious rancor, and that there was one issue, that of hu
man freedom, of free men and of free soil, that must ever
be uppermost in a republic. So these spirits joined in
the formation of the Republican party.
Some of them were written down fanatics, and they
were. The remnants of prejudice against the party that
still exist relate to its crusade against the institution of
slavery. Its great achievements, its statesmanlike deal
ing with other than its primordial issue, its gathering to
itself so many of the master minds of the country, were
all unforeseen that day that it met to make its first nomi
nation to the Presidency. Since then its history is
studded with achievements in every line of statecraft,
in finance, economics, the finding of paths for the indus
trial, scientific and ethical progress of the people, and in
the safeguarding of human rights.
The party meets again, forty-eight years after its first
convention, to remind the country of its history, of its
acts, of its promises and of its future purpose. The
speech of the temporary chairman is something more
than the opening address of a great convention. It is
another added to the many evidences of the abundant
statesmanship which the party has attracted to its lead
ership. The great men of its first score of years have
passed away, and those of its third decade are aged and
their ranks are thinned by mortality. Blaine and Conk
ling, Logan and Grant, Sherman and Evarts, McKinley
and Hanna are gone. But it raises the pride of Ameri
cans that the trust which fared well in their hands is not
to fail for lack of trustees capable of its administration.
The speech of Elihu Root places him in the front rank
as a worthy successor to those whose lives were the sub
ject of his threnody, and a fit companion of the living
whose purpose in party leadership he presented to the
country. We invite, all men to read it, and especially we
invite to it the attention of those Democrats to whom
the welfare of the country is dearer than a mere party,
victory. The Republican party may some time lapse, as
may happen to any human organization. But its na
tural force is now unabated. It has fixity of purpose,
coherence of policy, and is adolescent, in the sense of
possessing unimpaired' strength for achievement. No
Democrat need fear to read this speech lest it affront
him. It is not an indictment of his party, nor does it
mention anything done or threatened by it to~ hold it up
to contempt. It is free from that kind of partisanship.
"Viewing with alarm" is usually demagogic and this is
not the speech of a demagogue, but of a statesman who
uses the noble rhetoric of understatement in telling what
a great party has done for a great country and of the
further deeds of which it is capable to maintain that
greatness.

very well by nominating Fremont, who had become inti
mately known to the whole country as "the Pathfinder."
Benton's speeches on the Western country, his pio
neering of a Pacific railway along the path that Fremont
had blazed, his impassioned exclamation in his speech
on the courthouse steps in St. Louis pointing to the
West, "It is the Eastâ it is India." all had aided in fir
ing the popular imagination about Fremont, the young
army officer, one of the first Senators from California
and the husband of Jessie Benton. True, his' father-in
law refused to support 'him for the Presidency. When
asked if, he would do so Senator Benton supplied the
slang and epigram of the campaign by t replying "Not in
the day time, sir, not iiv the day time."
General Miles will make as good a dry campaign as
anybody "and will bring the Prohibition party into more
notice than it could gain through any other personality
in the country. The General is still what is known as
"a good looker." His record as a soldier deserves
respect, and even if his acceptance of a nomination is a
bit of old man's vanity the country will treat hirifwith
respect and he will be a picturesque figure in the cam
paign.

ST. LOUIS, June 22. â The San
Francisco building has been opened
at last and though the exhibit is by
no means finished many people visited
it to-day and were pleased with what
they saw. Custodian Charles P. Wll
comb has uaed extraordinary efforts
and the structure ' has been opened
much sooner than was expected.
From\the throng: of visitors to'-day
and the interest shown in the exhibits
in place, It looks as if the display
would be a great success. ' >Â¦ ,
The redwood desks and other fur
niture "of that material were greatly
admired. Among the features ' now
shown are a relief map of the bay re
gion, the hemisphere showing ocean
routes, pictures of principal streets,
including the Call building, and views
of the city in early times. The Uni
versity, of California Glee Club will
*ive a concert in the building to-mor
row. The entire model, city will be
formally opened next Monday.

Supervisor James Booth- of San
Francisco visited the exposition with
his sister, Mrs. Barr of New Orleans,
who camÂ« here to meet him. Mr.
Booth inspected the San Francisco
building and was well satisfied with it
when he learned the adverse circum
stances under which it had been erect
ed. He went to the Chicago convention
and will pay Yale College, where he
was a Rtudent for three years, a visit
before he returns home.
Norman E. Dole of "Stanford, who
holds the world's amateur record as a
pole vaulter. but who made a poor rec-Â»
ord when the Stanford team competed
at the Stadium here, is going to try to
redeem himself. He did 12 feet 1 32-100
inches in competition at Berkeley, but
failed to qualify here at 11 feet 3
inches Dole's explanation of this is
that the high Jump Just before the pole
vault threw tym out of stride and he
could not start well.
Dole has entered, unattached, for the
pole vault in the national amateur
meet on June 25 at the World's Fair
Stadium and he may establish a new
mark. He was not in good condition
when he came here from Chicago, but
is now at the home of relatives at
Hinsdale, near Chicago, training hard
and will be in good shape on the 25th.
Among those he will go against In the
pole vault is McLanagan of Yale, who
has a record of 11 feet 11 inches. .
Otis E. Hyde is the only other mem
ber of the Stanford team that remained
here. He is a son of Santa Clara's
Fair Commissioner. He has not en
tered for the games of the 25th, as he
realizes he is not in proper condition.
His specialty is the shotput and he has
a coast record of 45 feet 6% .inches for
that event.

Charles F. Wyer, Fresno County's
commissioner, is arranging for the
publication of special articles on her
farm and orchard products to .appear
in various farm Journals throughout
the Eastern States. The story of the
California Smyrna fig and its caprifica
tion by the imported blastophcpa is
creating wide interest. Smyrna made a
serious mistake when she allowed any
of the insects to escape from her bor
ders, for it looks as if the improved
California P.*" made possible by them
would drive hers from American mar
kets as the Fresno product increases.
The preparing and packing of the
California figs will be done under
modern methods and in a much more
cleanly manner than in Smyrna.

His courage has never deserted him,
and in the future of San Diego he sees

Fresnoites who visit the fair are dis
appointed that the project to increase
the market for raisins from their coun
ty by giving away samples is not un
der way. They realise what is being
lost when they note the success Santa
Clara County is meeting in advertising
her prunes by free demonstration.
There has been some hitch in Fresno in
the matter of securing the necessary
raisins. To procure the amount needed
and distribute It would not co~t more
than 53000. The visiting Fresno citi
zens who see the benefits to be derived
from a wide distribution of the chief
product of their county are hopeful that
the tangle will be straightened out and
the demonstration carried on.

CALIFORXIANS AT THE FAIR.
The Glee Club of the University of
California, led by Robert A. Waring,
is here under contract with the Califor
nia Promotion Committee and the com
mittee in charge of the San Francisco
building to give concerts at the latter
structure in connection with Mr. Er
wln's illustrated lectures. There are
twenty-five students in the party.
They are quartered at the San Fran
cisco building. It not being open when
they arrived, the boys have been dis
playing their talent at the California
building. They gave a concert in the
lecture-room there Saturday afternoon
in competition with the Boer war and
Jerusalem. Sunday night they gave a
special concert at the building, to which
all the State commissioners were in
vited by Commissioner Wiggins of Cal
ifornia. The music of the Glee Club has
delighted the crowds that have heard
it and has proved an excellent adver
tisement of California.
The next annual meeting of the Amer
ican Surgical Association will be held
In San Francisco next June. Dr. Em
met Rixford dT San Francisco has been
attending the session here just closed,
and was elected vice president.
F. E. Moneghan, known as the father
of Needles, is among the visitors to the
exposition. Moneghan was at one, time
a railroad conductor. He founded
Needles and is now an oil king.

ance and real estate man of Stockton,

During one day this week 106 people
told Frank A. Kimball, the commis
sioner from San Diego County, that
they intended to visit his city and
county, and it was to obtain informa
tion to guide them that they called at
the booth. All the visitors to the San
Diego display are greatly interested in
the products exhibited and the fifteen
foot birdseye view of the city and har
bor â one oT the most nearly perfect har
bors in the world â but the proposed
Fteel works seem to excite the greatest
curiosity. San Diego is already famous
for her products, her climate and her
harbor, and the possibility of the es
tablishment of such a vast enterprise
as the one named is all that is neces
sary to again bring a strong tide of
immigration.

ST. LOUIS, June 22.â The possibility j
that San Diego is to have a steel works, !
employing from 3000 to 10,000 men,^
seems to be awakening a gTeat inter- '
est in that city, and many visitors are
making inquiries concerning the pro
ject at the San Diego County exhibit
:n the Palace of Agriculture. The
scheme, as generally known in Calif or- '.
nia, is to bring iron ore from the Tepu- !
stete deix>sits, on the coast of Lower
California not far below San Diego, j
These deposits are looked upon as in- '.
exhaustible, and vessels can load easily
with the ore. The employing of 3000
men would mean an immediate Increase
in the city's population of at least 10,
000 people and would arouse great ac- j
tivity. If the project carries San Diego
will exr-erience another boom and en- '
joy a great advance, from whicli she
will not recede.

In the first round of their legal
fight against the Park Commission for
right to sell on the ocean beach the
peddlers yesterday met a reverse. Su
perior Judge Hunt sustained the de
murrer of the Park Commission to
the complaint of William Kanelakis,
who applied for an Injunction to pre
vent the commission from enforcing
its order against the vendors of pea
nuts and popcorn who had been reap
ing a. -harvest of nickels at the edge
of the sea.
The demurrer was sustained on the
contention that it was impossible to
ascertain from the complaint how the
act of the Park Commission would
cause any great Injury or oppression
to the plaintiff, and that It was Im
possible to estimate what pecuniary
damage would result to the plaintiff
by reason of the commission's order.
The peddler was allowed ten days in
which to file an amended answer.

In the olden days, before the wane of
ecclesiastical training,* men prayed for
the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit, the
second of which was understanding,
or a sense of proportionate values.
Alas, that the prayers should have
ceased before the gifts were perma
nently bestowed! All" through life, now
adays, we miss the sense of relative
values, but nowhere more than in lit
erary criticism. Even as ln the field
of ethics we hear conventionality and
grace of manners put on a par with
loyalty and courage; in literature we
meet the permanent and the current
yoked together, regardless of effect â
Pegasus and the dray horse Jog-trot
ting side by side.
In this age of chaotic criticism how
are the public to choose books? If bur
reviews seriously advise the public"
that a book is worthy to stand by
Shakespeare's "Hamlet" and Marie
Corelli's "Boy," what is a bewildered
reader to think? If Miss Glasgow's
large and seriously wrought novel,
"The Deliverance," comes bracketed by
the unfortunate chances of time and
season of publishing with Mr. Har
land's "My Friend Prospero." how are
the readers to know that one la a
Rodin statue and the other a Dresden
china shepherdess. It almost amounts
to the impossibility of the growth of a
literature in this . country.â Harper's

Proportionate Values.
Two years ago she was awarded the
blue ribbon for being the best grey
hound in the dog show. She was fault
less in her dainty conformation, but
beneath her graceful lines were muscles
of steel and a heart as stout as ever
throbbed within the frame of a "grey
hound.
The loss Is doubly felt now, as she
was rounding into her best form and
great triumphs ln the field seemed with
in her reach.
'Rubber Ankles, the most beautiful
greyhound in all America and one of
the gamest, died yesterday at the ken
nels of James Sweeney at Colma.
Pleuro-pneumonla was the cause of her
untimely taking off. -
Rubber Ankles was bred by J. H.
Rosseter of this city. She was by the
noted imported English dog Fortuna
Favente from the kennels of the
Messrs. Fawcett, and waa out of Brll
liantlne. The latter waa bred by H. C.
Lowe, of Kansas and was by Lord Nev
ersettle-Whlte LJps. Rubber Ankles
won the American Waterloo last year
ln the nomination of Mr. Rosaeter. thus
proving her quality on the field against
the fleetest of American coursers.
In the meantime Jeffries is chafing
under the enforced idleness. The big
arms and brawny chest of the boiler
maker are encased in a silk shirt, while
he lies propped up with his game les
straightened out ln a big double bed
which he makes look like a cot. Thera
is a splint under the knee to keep it
straight and the entire leg from the
ankle to the thigh is wrapped ln ban
dages.
A professional masseur was sent up
to knead the champion's muscles yes
terday and Jeffries laughed heartily as
he told the doctor about the efforts of
the man. "He Just tickled me." said
the champion. Jeffries has been accus
tomed to have two and sometimes
three burly heavy-weights rub him
down with hands calloused and coarse,
and the soft hands of the masseur
made no Impression. It was agreed,
however, that rubbing would aid in
keeping: him in good condition and Joe
Kennedy or some other big 1 fellow will
visit the champion hereafter every day
to give him a hard rub down.
The knee that Interfered with the
world's heavy-weight championship
battle was slightly on the mend last
evening and big Jim Jeffries and Dr.
W. S. Porter both agree the trouble
some Joint will soon yield to treatment.
Just how long it is going to be before
the big fellow can move around cannot
yet be told. It Is big and red from
painting and is puffy around the joint.
Tapping took away a lot of the swell
ling yesterday afternoon, but there was
a quantity of water there again last
night. This is. expected to be absorbed
naturally.
In speaking of his patient's condition.
Dr. Porter said:
From the chant- already notlceabl* I esa
say that this Injury will be entirely cured.
But when you ask me how long It will tak*
you ask more than I am able to lay. I have
told Jeffries he must stay ln bed ten day*.
By that time we will see. The knee looka
better and feels better than It did on Tues
day and there la no question about its ultimate
recovery.

Although the pearl fishery season In

ernment earnings having amounted to
ove,r Â£1,000.000 ($5,000,000), there Is
no prospect of a fall In the price of
pearl necklaces. ~ . .
"Ceylon pearls," said a member of the
firm of E. Hahn & Co. of Hatten Gar
den, London, recently, "will not affect
the British market.' The bulk of the
pearls we get come from western Aus
tralia. Prices are high, and a ten-grain
pearl win continue to bring Â£200
($1000)~for some'time to come."
Mr. Streeter of the .well-known Bond
street firm remarked that Ceylon pearls
are never larger, than a pea â three or
four grains at the most. "Even a rec
ord yield," he said, "could not bring
about a fall in the English , market

NEW YORK, June 22.â Jockey John
J. Bullman, accompanied by his inti

ealied for Europe to-day. Their de
parture came as a surprise to even
their closest friends. It was the prin
cipal topic of discussion around Sheeps

Behind Â¦ Bullman's departure lies a
tale of domestic) woe. Bullman left be
hind him a young wiOe and four charm-

some four-year-old John J. Bullman
Jr.. the youngest a baby just 7 months
old.
I Mrs. Bullman was formerly Miss May
Herbert of San Francisco. Mrs. Bull
man said to-night: "Our married life
was fairly happy until last January in
San Francisco. At that time he got
drunk and abused me. He has been
drinking heavily all spring, and sum
mer, and when drunk has abused me
shamefully in every way, often beat
ing me until my face and body would
be bruised and discolored for days.!'
Mrs. Bullman says that in addition
to the Sheepshead Bay home her hus
band owns two handsome furnished
residences in San Francisco and two in

SHEEPSHEAD BAT, June 22. â It
was good to see a high-class racer
like Beldame, daughter of the fast
horse Octagon, win the Mermaid
stakes, which she did in a canter to
day at the Coney Island Jockey Club
course, in the presence of a large at
tendance. Beldame has not failed the
public in a single instance this year.
If ever there was an excusa for a man
risking a few dollars the Mermaid
stakes afforded that excuse and Bel
dame the medium. The odds, 11 to
20, were not prohibitive after it was
seen that Audience had warmed up so
badly as to have little or no chance.
William Lakeland's filly Little j Em
finished second to Beldame and an
other old time Brighton Beacher se
cured third money when Charley Ox's
Possession finished In that position.
E. R. Thomas won two races and
nearly won a third. Niblick came as
near as possible to defeating Blandy
ln ,the juvenile race, which was run
on the main track and could be seen
from start to finish. It was only in
the last few strides that O'Nell suc
ceeded ln getting Blandy up to Nib
lick, which had deprived the pace
maker, Councilman, of the lead in the
last hundred yards. Many wondered
what Induced Jockey Hicks to make
so much use of Councilman. For five
furlongs he was so full of speed that
a slight reservation of it in the early
part of the race might have landed
him in front at the wire.
The gray and magenta colors of Mr.
Thomas were seen in front on Lady
Amelia and Buttons. The first named
broke the track record at six and a
half furlongs, running the distance in
1:19. The former record was 1:19 1-6,
held by John Daly's Glennellle. Sum

The dashing poloists and hunting
men of the Burlingame Country Club
have a sporting match in prospect
which has created no end of discussion
in the San Mateo County haven of
sportsmen.
As is generally known, Walter S. Ho
bart and Francis J. Carolan own tha
greatest two ponies in America, the
former's Silver Dick being famous as a
sprinter on two continents, while Mr.
Carolan's Fusillade is equally great
over a distance of ground. In addition
to Silver Dick Mr. Hobart has a great
pony named Ora, of which he has a
high opinion.
The proud owners have some foals by
their horses, and it is in them that in
terest centers just now. There has been
a discussion as to what speed they will
show when they are old enough to go to
the races, and this discussion has re
sulted in the arrangement of a Futurity
stakes in miniature.
A sweepstakes at $000 a corner has
been arranged, the ponies to meet when
well advanced in their two-year-old
form, which will be the summer of 1906.
As Rudolph Spreckels, president of the
California Polo and Pony Racing Asso
ciation, is an enthusiastic breeder of
race ponies, the match is left open for
him to make a nomination if he so de
sires. It has been stipulated that the
lightest available Jockeys will be used.
Each of the owners has some year
lings at present, and it Is possible they
will make another match to be decided
next year.
The first of Fusillade's progeny will
soon be ready to race. Fusillade Is as
well bred as any living race horse. He
is by St. Leger, and the latter was by
Doncaster. Ben d'Or was sired by Don
caster and he in turn sired the mighty
Ormonde.
PORTLAND. June 22.â For eight
weary innings the local fans saw the
home team dish up ball that would
make an Asiatic's heart ache. Then
many of the spectators sorrowfully
meandered to the street cars and sat
down In gloom. But for the faithful
there was a gre&t thrill in store. For
just such a sensation many bad hoped
till hope seemed futile indeed.
Klrby Drennan turned the trick.
With one foot practically in a sling he
hobbled out to the home plate and
emote the sphere viciously. Castro had
already received a pass to first and
Chase had bungled when Steelman hit
hard- Roach had gone to sleep between
bags during the game, so Drennan bat
ted for him and Castro scored. Nadeau
hit one to center and Spencer, fleet of
foot, came home. Then McCreedie sin
gled, and Nadeau brought in the tally
that won the game for Portland. The
score:

thougm the game was his after the
first inning, in which the Commuters
were six to the good. A batter hit, a
base on balls, followed by errors by
Lynch and McLaughlin. coupled with
streib's double and Byrnes* single,
followed Doyle's costly error. The
Tigers were game and kept fighting.
In the fifth, with the bases full, Byrne
dropped Graham's easy fly and timely
hits by Hogan and Thomas helped to
bring "in five.
Both clubs continued to fight until
the end and the pitchers were hit
hard. Francks and Casey did the best
fielding, while Schlafley made a won
derful one-hand catch. Thomas pitch
ed good ball after the first and fielded
his position cleverly.
With one run In and a man on base
Thomas struck Schlafley out in the
eighth- In the ninth Kruger doubled,
but Doyle made a pretty stop" of
Streib's drive and the next two flew
to Casey, spoiling Oakland's chance to
win- Score:

"When one notices the extraordinarily
large sums which have been spent en
the acquisition of snuff boxes one Is
less surprised that the habit of snuff
taking has been abandoned than one
would be if it were to be revived. Two
thirds of the Hawkins sale, composed
mainly of snuff boxes, yields the enor
mous amount of Â£127.000. and of this
the Â£1050 paid for a Louis XIV oval
gold box, inlaid with six plaques and
painted with classical themes, is an
example of the attractions which
these objects de vertu have always
exercised over purchasers of antiqui

The largest grapevine in the world
is growing in the Carplnteria Valley,
twelve miles east of Santa Barbara,
Cal., and is called La Para Grande. It
was started from a cutting sixty-one
years ago by a voung Spanish woman.
Dona Ayala. It is. eight feet four Inches
in circumference at its base and one
of the horizontal branches measures
more than three feet ln circumference.
The trellis covers about a third of an
acre and sixty heavy posts support it.
The vine produces as many as 5000
bunches annually, at a conservative
estimate, and in good years many
clusters measure twelve to fifteen
Inches in length and weigh six to eight
pounds. Its owner estimates that In
1895 the vine yielded ten tons of grapes.

of Representatives to provide bounties
for the encouragement of the Iron and
steel industries In Australia. Should
this bill pass and become law, as It
probably will in a modified form, the
imports of iron and steel from the

It provides a bounty of $2 48 per ton

John Brown, alias George Gibbons,
alias Joe Fannon, an ex-convict, went
into the room of L. Smith at 640
Howard street shortly after 5 o'clock
yesterday morning and stole a dollar
and a revolver from the pockets of
Smith's trousers. Smith was awaken
ed by Brown's moving his hand under
the pillow in search of more coin.
Brown said, "Is that you, George?"
Brown replied, "No, it ain't George.
Who in thunder are you?" Brown
ran out of the room and Smith tried
to catch him, but failed.
About an hour later Policemen Till
man and Hinrichs, who had been noti
fied by Smith, learned that a man an
swering Brown's description had been
seen entering the lodging-house at 205
Third street. They went there and
met Brown rnnning downstairs. They
grabbed hold of him. C. F. Mann
then appeared at the top of the stairs
and said that he had caught Brown
going through his trousers pockets.
Brown had a skeleton key In his pock

Until about ten years ago the subma

the whole world's supply of gutta percha
for the reason that, unlike rubber, it Is
not affected by salt water. But when
the game of golf became the fad in
Europe, England and the United States,
it was found that gutta percha is the
only satisfactory material out of which
to make the balls, and the demand for
it Increased to so great an extent that
the production nearly doubled.
The ships from Singapore, Straits
Settlements, now bring enormous car
goes of it, and although twice as much
is imported by England as was Im
ported ten years ago, the price has ad
vanced about 100 per cent. This, the
cable companies say, Is due solely to
the manufacture of golf balls. â New

This second charge was sworn out
before Justice T. B. Pratt of Crock
ett. The reason for taking the case so
far from the scene of the crime and
"over the beads of much nearer Jus
tices of the Peace" is alleged to be
through a fear that the very large
number of sympathizers with Cordoz.-v
in the Clayton and Concord districts
might influence the judgments of the
representatives of the law.
The second preliminary hearing of
Cordoza will be held in Martinez at
10 a. m. next Monday before Justice of
the Peace T. B. Pratt.
The story of -the killing of Powell is
too well known to need repeating.

ground that the defendant's crippled

John Kolen, first, second and third
mate and boatswain and cook of the
coasting scow Merry Mary, was sing
ing "Let All Obey" at 1:30 o'clock yes
terday morning on Pine street, near
Dupont, and so loud was his voice that
two policemen three blocks away heard
it. Hastening to where the vocalist
stood they commanded him to cease,
but he refused to obey by continuing to
growl "Let All Obey." They ran him in,
and all the way to the Hall of Justice
he continued his song. When he in
formed Judge Mogan that the Merry
Mary lay In the offing and could not
proceed to sea without him an order of
dismissal was, entered.
Case continued and Seaman Kenne
dy's superior officer communicated

James Kennedy, one of Uncle Sam's
gallant Jackles, appeared with several
Inches of facial cuticle missing, and
when Judge Fritz asked him what kind
of a skin game he had been against he
pleaded failure to remember.
Two colored ladies. Miss Nealie Quinn
and Miss Arlina Duffln, accused the tar
of invadinc their dwelling in Pinckney
alley and "cuttin" up kinder rough." In
response to a judicial inquiry as to
what "cutting up rough" meant. Miss
Nealie coyly explained that In the case
of Mariner Kennedy it meant that he
had struck her head wtlh a heavy
water "pitcher, smashing the vessel to
fragments and damaging her cranium
but slightly. Miss Duffln averred that
while she had not been assaulted her
feelings were very much hurt by the
way in which the defendant assailed
her character. No, his face was not
scratched when he "busted inter" the
house, and she was perfectly sure that
neither she nor Miss Nealie had
scratched it.^ How was it done, then?
How did she know? "Might a done It
hisself."

As evidence of his industry Peter ex
hibited a pair of gnarled and tarry
hands. And as he left the courtroom
he murmured, "Ah ban dronk."
Peter Oleson, a deep water sailor, was
accused of robbery by James Flaherty,
another son of Neptune, but the com
plainant's story was so weak and the
defendant's plea so strong that Judge
Fritz dismissed the case.
A jury in Judge Fritz's court began
the hearing of testimony for the pros
ecution of E. E. Sproat, charged with
defrauding the creditors of Sproat's
market, of which he was the principal
owner. There are twenty-seven com
plaints and the total amount alleged
to have been embezzled is $18,000.
Judge Mogan dismissed the charge o(
manslaughter against Charles F. Large,
a drug clerk, who on June 5 caused the
death of John Joseph McCann by giv
ing him carbolic acid to drink in mis
take for water. The defendant ex
plained that while he was off duty an
assistant had taken the bottle of car
bolic acid from a shelf, cleaned it, la
beled it anew and left it where the bot
tle of distilled water usually was kept.
That was how he happened to dilute
with acid instead of water the powder
which McCann called for and wanted
in a hurry.
Former Police Sergeant Reuben A.
Wolf was acquitted of the charge of
battery after he had informed a jury
in Judge Fritz's court that it was in
self-defense he assaulted Edmund E.
Coblentz, a newspaper reporter, who
had been detailed to-ascertain his con
nection with the management of a
mercantile agency that had collapsed
and left many victims mourning the
disappearance of their money.
Then the group commixed. Half a
dozen voices , were simultaneously
shouting in angry tone and when the
bailiff's gavel proved ineffective to
quell the hubbub physical force was
resorted to. As the expert cowboy
cuts out steers from a herd, so did
the two officers disentangle and silence
the bunch of belligerents.
When the elderly, lady was given
the stand she said her name was Mrs.
Clara Schivo and her place of resi
dence at Lombard and Dupont streets.
Shaking her fist at Commencia, she
shouted: "He hasn't paid a cent for
little Harry's support since last Febru
ary and the last time the child went
to see him he shook a handful of gold
in its little face and said he would
throK it in the bay before he'd give
a cent of it to my daughter."
The Judge gave the defendant, who
is a cement worker and earn3 good
wages, one week in which to pay all
that he owes for his child's mainte
nance, else he will be sent to jail.
Two brawny bailiffs had as many
minutes of strenuous effort before
they restored to Police Judge Mogan'.

routed by the "parties in the case of
L>ouis Commencia, charged with fail
ure to provide for the maintenance of
his five-year-old son, Harry. Among
those who participated in the mixup
were the defendant, his former wife,
her mother, the child in the case and
two attorneys. Only the prompt in

battle royaL
Commencia's wife obtained a di
vorce last February and the court
awarded her the custody of the boy
and ordered the father to pay her $S
a month for its support. After pay
ing one installment he declined to pay
any more and defied her to collect.
She has been unable to keep the child

ing to pay this woman any more
money," said the defendant's attor
ney. "He has told me that she is in
love with a man of th,e name of Gal
leo, and "
"You're a liar," piped a thin voice
from the back benches, and a little old
lady was seen hastening to the front.
Her demeanor was truculent and the
attorney quailed as she approached
him. "You're a liar," she repeated,
when she arrived within striking dis
tance. "I'm her mother and I dare
you to say it again I"
"But I didn't say it; I only said he
(pointing at the defendant) told me
so!" shouted the lawyer, backing
away.

The Occidental and Oriental Steam
ship Company's liner Coptic, Captain
Armstrong, sailed yesterday for the
Orient with a large number of pas
eengers and <000 tons of cargo. She
also carried treasure valued at 5800,
tH'O, mostly in silver.
The Coptic's passengers included
about two score United States Govern
ment employes returning to the Fhilip-
I'ip.es fruin their vacations. Jules Brett.
Mexican Consul at Tokio. and Mr?.
Brett were passengers on the liner.
There were also fifty-three Chinese
passengers.
The Coptic's cargo includes 400 tons
of load, 1200 tons of flour and 500 tons
of railroad iron for Japanese ports..
The passengers included the follow
ing named:
LizzIe'Flammers and Guinardo Tran
sachi were the contracting parties in
the third June wedding effected by the
Mogan Matrimonial Bureau. They
were defendants on a charge of dis
turbing the peace, the man having
blackened one of the woman's eyes
with his fist after she had laughed to
scorn hi3 suggestion that she apply less
powder to her face ere she sallied
abroad. The charge was dismissed bv
the same magisterial authority that
made them one.
In deference to Quinardo's desire,
Lizzie's only ' display of facial powder
as she approached the altar was con
fined to one thick patch ov r her facial
discoloration. The ceremony was
marked by the simplicity that accom
panies all uniting of hearts and hand.*
by the Judge of Department No. L
There were no bridesmaids, no oscilla
tory congratulations, -no flowers;
neither was there any throwing of rice
or old shoes.
Senor and Senora Transachl will con
tinue to occupy the apartments 210^j
"Washington street, which have been
Jointly theirs for a year. They will be
at home to friends as soon as the
bride's right eye ceases to be reminis
cent of ante-nuptial unpleasantness.
Another military scandal was devel
oped by the arrest of Henry Bpnn for
disturbing the peace of his home at
Beach and Lyon streets on complaint
of his wife and daughter. The ladies
did not appear to prosecute, but sent
word to Judge Mogan that they would
be pleased to have him send the de
fendant to jail for thirty days. His
Honor ungallantly scorned the sugges
tion and afterward expressed pleasure
that he' had done so, for the defendant
informed him that the cause of his ar
rest was his objection to his daughter,
a married woman, receiving a soldier
wooer at her home while her husband
was absent. Mr. Bonn was discharged
and advised to continue protecting the
honor of his son-in-law from military
invasion.
Fred Moller is held on three charges
of burglary, and his total bail is $9000.
He qame from the East and operated
successfully as long as he confined his
pilferings to small articles, such as
jewelry, but when he attempted to get
away with a large copper boiler be
longing to a Hayes-street housewife he
was caught.
J. Povelson, a Market-street Jeweler,
was before Judge Conlan on the charge
of practicing optometry without hav
ing first obtained the certificate of reg
istration required by the statute. A
continuance was asked for and
granted.
Three times on Saturday evening and
twice on Monday evening was Paul
Martinelli ejected from the Empire
Concert Hall, on Montgomery avenue,
for his rude and boisterous behavior,
and when he returned for the third
time on the latter evening he was ar
rested by Special Officer Agnew. In
the court of Judge Mogan the defend
ant sat and grinned defiantly while
the policeman recounted in detail hi3
offenses, one of which consisted of
throwing peanuts at the lady vocalists
on the stage. It mattered not, the wit
ness said, whether the song was sen
timental or comic, the singer was pelt
ed with peanuts by the defendant.
Several of the lady artists were in
court and ready to corroborate what
the officer said, but without hearing
their testimony Judge Mogan pro
nounced Mr. Martinelli guilty of dis
turbing the peace and ordered him to
appear to-day for sentence.
reduce the fine proportionately and
make it $5."
"Ain't you sorry you haven't lost
another leg and arm?" inquired Clerk
Grey as he collected the fine. Ah Sing
winked his solitary eye and answered
"No sabbee."

ers cannot afford to ship the stripped
leaf when the unstemmed leaf can be
entered at English ports six cents
lower. Leaf tobacco will be the thing
for export after this. And the North At
lantic ports will not lose the business,
either. The rate in that .direction is
ten cents a hundred higher, I will ad
mit, but ten cents a hundred pounds
on tobacco is nothing -in comparison
with the more rapid time which can be
made by the North Atlantic ports." â
New York Commercial.
Leaf Tobacco for Export,
The dispatch from St. Petersburg to
the effect that an epidemic of cholera
and typhoid is threatened at Harbin,
'the Russian military base in Man
churia, is surprising only by reason of
the fact that it was permitted to pass
the censorship.
What has been learned from experi
ence in former wars seems to be easily
forgotten. In the Crimea the French
lost 236 men from sickness to 64 from
wounds in each thousand. The death
rate of the English was 179 from sick
ness and 47 from wounds. In Mexico the
French lost, per 1000, 140 from sickness
and 49 from wounds. In the Russo-
Turkish war the Russians lost, per 1000,
113 from sickness and 49 from wounds.
The losses in the American Civil War
during two years, June, 1861, to June,
1863, were 53.2 per thousand, of which
8.6 were from wounds and 44.6 from
sickness. In the Boer war, while the
figures are not at hand in complete
form, it is well known that sickness
was vastly more fatal than Boer
marksmanship, deadly as that was ad
mitted to be. â New York Times.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
WEDNESDAY. JUNE 22.
The good old fashion of naming the
son after the father Is again being
largely followed in the case of the birth
of an heir. â London Mail.
The names of precious "stones are also
very popular for little girls. Lord Ed
ward Churchill's two small daughters
are called Rubyiand Beryl, while Dia
mond is the very uncommon name
given to the baby girl of Lady Har
dlnge, whose husband has lately been
appointed Embassador to St. Peters
burg. Pearl and Garnet are among
other stones of which the appellations
are taken for small maidens, the idea
being to call the little one after the
stone for the month in which she was
born.
Instead of the ugly silver christening
mug of the '70's, the most graceful cups
and vases are given. The guild of
handicraft is often called upon to exe
cute customers' own designs. A favor
ite pattern is the tall, simply curved
cup, studded with carbuncles, corne
lians, chrysopraaes and generally has
the infant recipient's name engraved
Just below the edee. -
With regard to names, the tendency
is to return to the quaint old titles of
our great-grandmothers', time, and
Gladys, Mabel or Gwendolen has been
replaced by Joan or Barbara, Margot
or Betty.
The youngest generation of to-day
shares the advantages with the elder
of the great improvements which have
been made in the realms of applied
art.

The Poultry market continued very weak for
nearly all descriptions, as retailers were com
plaining of the light consumptive demand,
caused by the absence of so many people from
?he city, and were purchasing no more than
absolutely necessary for Immediate require
ments. Fryers and young Roosters, which,
were In very light supply, were firm at pre
vious prices, but all other descriptions, par
ticularly Hens, were dull. The weakness In
Hens Is shown by the fact that two carloads
of Western have been standing on tha track
across the bay since Tuesday awaiting: more
favorable market conditions.

Nezv York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. June 22.â The most noteworthy
fact about to-day's stock market was Its firm
ness in the face of excessive dullness. The
dullness approached stagnation at frequent
period*. But prices wÂ»re tenaciously held all
through the day. even with a demand so scanty
as 1.1 be Imperceptible for most of the time.
A number of minor stocks and specialties gave
nme sympathetic t-upport '_to the market by
their strength, which was unexplained In the
news events. Tlic Canadian Pacific group was
a prominent example, and was in demand
both here and In London. The common surmise
was that this movement was based on the
crop prospects in the Canadian Pacific's west
ern territory. Our own granger atock*. how
ever, did not extend the upper movement of
yesterday to any important degree. The con
tinued quietude of Southern Pacific was In
favor of the market. The quick subscription
lor the Burlington bond isisue and the sales of
the Rock Island notes made a good impression.
although the Rock Island Issue 'is recognized
as an expedient against the present poor mar
ket for bond*. Â¦
The tone of the bond market continued firm.
Total sales. pÂ«r value, $2,485,000.
United States bond* were unchanged on call.
The governing committee of the Stock Ex
change to-day readmitted to its listing depart
ment the preferred and common shares of the
American Steel Foundries Company to the
amount of $15,000,000 each.
The governors of the New York Stock Ex
change have decided to 'clone the exchange on
July 2 the Saturday before the Fourth of July.

Prices of new white Potatoes had a sharp
advance under decreased supplies and a steady
demand, both for local consumption and ex
port. Rival Jobbers were still competing for
extra fancy stock and one small lot was sold
at $2 10 per cental. There was a fair inquiry
for Early Rose and Garnet Chiles and the
light receipts were well cared for at previous
prices. Red Onions were a little firmer, but
yellow were unchanged.
Green Corn and Cucumbers were in Increased
supply and both declined sharply. Los An
geles Tomatoes were firmer -under light re
ceipts and the market was well cleaned up
at the clore. Advices from the southern part
of the State say that almost the entire crop
of Tomatoes has been dried up by the hot
Bun and receipts are expected to be light for
some little while. New crop Green Peppers
are coming In freely and are bringing good
prices. Los Angeles Peppers have about had
their run and the quotations are withdrawn.

weak, while at all of the producing points In
the United States and, in fact, throughout the
world, the undertone is strong, with every
reason to believe that prices will go still
higher. Boston operators are doubtless aware
of the latter condition, and, notwithstanding
their dull market and the quiet trade in
progress in other Eastern centers, they have
agents out in all directions competing keenly
for available offerings^of Wool and paying
fancy prices. The local market Is In good
condition, with trading lively at the improved
prices, choice Wools readily bringing full
quotations." ';

CONDITION OF BUSINESS.
How a -Vrtc York Financier
Views the Situation.
ThÂ« New York circular of Henry Clews sars:
"Though dealing* on the Stock Exchange
sire limited, the market displays a strength
or undertone that promises well for the future,
lirovided no untoward events Intervene during
the next tw o months. The chief source of
Â«;re.rjr.h at present la a satisfactory monetary
situation, funds being plentiful enough to
avoid any anxiety concerning crop demands
â¢ hen they begin- The next reason for hope
fulness ic the crop outlook, which Is satisfac
tory as a whols in spite of backwardness. Re
ports of biusineM reaction are frequent and
are unfortunately confirmed by current reports
of railroad earning* and other evidences of
contraction; but Wall street turns a com
j>a.rativr!y dtaf ear to such arguments, and
replies that all Â»uch conditions were discount
ed long ago by the shrinkage in security values
fcnd that the time is now ripe for anticipating
better thing*.
"One eigniflcant demonstration of confidence
is the quick absorption of recent bond issues.
These have bern numerous and large, but the
promptr.ee* with which they have been taken
end their absolute failure to depress the stock
market reveal aii underlying strength that is
loth surprising and gratifying. Thi* week has
witnessed two new big issuesâ $10,000,000 New
York Central bonds and $40,000,000 Southern
Paciflc preferrÂ«d 7 per cent stock. The former
was expected but the latter was a surprise,
but neither exerted any appreciative pressure
on the market, excepting in the Southern Pa
cific common ehares. This shows a buying
power In reserve that was quite unexpected.
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS.
"Though financial conditions have much Im
proved, the same can hardly be said of gen
eral business and industry, both of which are
handicapped by high prices and high costs of
production. The process of readjustment, how
ever, la already under way. Pigtron has had
a heavy fall, and finished iron products must
toon, accept the inevitable, although price*
are still held up by trust influences and con
tracts delayed in consequence. A great deal
of work is al*o postponed by the excessive
demands of labor; but these, too, must be
modified by the Inevitable levellng-down pro
cest, which has already set in. Cotton and
cotton goods are also declining, and thus
facilitating re-establishment of the industry
upon a sounder basif than heretofore. Thi*
process of readjustment, painful a? It is, must
te faced, and the H-ss it is resisted the better
for all. Costs of production are altogether too
high and the cost of living cannot be reduced
until these come down from the excessively
htgh level of the past few years. As soon as
those who take the initiative find values eet
tled upon a. more normal bafts business im
provement will succeed present depression.
Good crops this fail will be the most Important
factor in ary improvement. Crop failure*
would be national disasters, not only as affect
ing our Jorelgn trade and our agriculture as
the chief basis of our prosperity, but also be
cause of the effect upon prices of food prod
ucts, which are already very high for the rea
son that demand is overtaking supply. Hence,
our particular needs this year is good crop*.
OUR FOREIGN TRADE.
â¢A rather unsatisfactory feature of our for
eign trade movement was a decrease of $15.
ffjy/HX) in May exports, due to a shrinkage of
ffc.fXXi.OOO In wheat. $3,000,000 in cotton and
*2!sÂ«io!cÂ«JO in corn. ' Our exports of manufac
tures and minerals are, however, increasing,
and If the present downward tendency of com
rr.odity rrices continues the shrinkage in ex
ports will be only a temporary affair.
"Our credit abroad continues good, and gold
shipment* appear to have ceased for the pres
ent. Euroi* having satisfied Its Immediate
nants. What effect the war will have upon
the gold movement remains to be seen, this
and the increasing eupply of loanable funds
being the chief Inducements to gold ehiptnentE.
Very soon future cotton and grain bills will
b* in better supply, sufficient, possibly, to off
set these influences. Little attention is paid
to the Presidential campaign, which contains
no Â¦>â¢_.;.:.*-Â¦ or alarming issues and no queetlon
com-ernms; the soundness of our currency.
"The outlook for the market may be con
fc.dered more favorable. Bad features have
been amply discounted, stockg are concentrated
In strong hand* and money 1* plentiful. These
a<-e conditions favorable to manipulation should
the big leaders to agree, and in the absence
Â»rf *ufh plans we may look for a fair trading
imtrket. subject to the influence at all times
of '-rop reports."

STOCK MARKET.
CHICAGO, June 22. â Initial quotations on
July wheat were unchanged to %c lower at
84%c to S4?ic. September was unchanged to
a shade higher at 7!>!*@8Cc. Early In the day
there were conflicting elements â small re
ceipts, a strength of foreign grain markets
and a bearish Prussian crop report, as op
posed to excellent weather in the Southwest
and a bearish crop report from Iowa. For a
time "a quite general disposition to sell was
manifested, resulting In a slight â¢ de-~
dine. t Then the sentiment In the pit
suddenly changed. July advanced to 85%c and
September to 80%@80i4e. The market again
weakened on selling of September by North
western houses, the distant delivery declining
to 79%(g'79%c. July showed more firmness,
selllni? off a trlflo and Just before the close all
the loss was regained on covering by shorts,
rir.nl figures showing almost no change from
yesterday's closing prices. July closed at a
gain of %c, 84?ic; September was unchanged
at 79 %c.'
At. the start the corn market showed a little
downward tendency, but the close was steady,
with July a shade higher at 48%c. September
closed at 48%<SH8%c.
Small receipts and a bullish Prussian crop
report had a steadying effect on oats. July
closed unchanged at 39%c.
Provisions were weak under general liquida
tion. The market closed near the low point,
with September pork down 20c, lard off 10@

That the board of trustees of the j

fully detennined to award the contract
for butter supply to "Wheaton. Pond &
Harrold before looking, at. the other,
bids is the opinion of the other dairy
produce companies that entered com- j
petitive bids. A. I* Lundy stated
yesterday that alter the envel
opes had been opened a . filled out
bid was discovered among them with
no signature attached. A comparison
of the bids was made by Judge Reuben
Swain, with the result that the.' un
signed one was said by Mr. Harrold to
be that submitted by his firm. Imme
diately thereafter the board of trustees
awarded % the contract to Wheaton.
Pond & Harrold, although their bid was
higher than that of any competitor ex
cept one. causing a yearly difference of
S2000 to the State.
Max Goldberg of 638 .Kearny street,
one of the trustees of the Napa State
Hospital, says the action of the board
in awarding the contract to the highest
bidder was due. to the fact that that
company had served the Institution for
the last year without cause of com
plaint. Previously to that time they had
been served with inferior and bad but
ter and frequent complaint had to be
made. The board came to the conclu
sion that good butter could not be
served at such a low price an^,Â°" ffl
count of the previous good service the
contract was relet to Wheaton. Pond &
Harrold for the ensuing year.
Louis Titus, attorney for the A. u.
Lundy Company, says his clients win
offer a bond with any surety company
to furnish a good grade of butter at the
price in their bid. The Lundy Company
owns two dairies, which turn out a
total daily supply of 3000 pounds, and
i that is the reason for their extremely
i low bid. That their service is satisfac
tory is evidenced by their being re
awarded the contracts for the Mendo
cino State Hospital and for the Agnew
Hospital for the Chronic Insane for the
ensuing year at the price quoted to the

In the leading role Is universally rec

The work of repairing the Injured

ble, for the cost of keeping the freight

At this rate even the Morgans and
Rockefellers .could not pay lodging ex
penses for ships â¢ for any length oi
time. Bids will be received" for thf
work of repairing the . vessel as soot
as Captain Metcalf completes. his esti
mates. â¢ Â¦
Captain Lockett. who commanded
the Algoa. 'at. the time of. the accident,
was one of the first to view the injured
hull. He seemed almost broken-heart
ed when he saw the ravages worked on
her by the sharp rocks of Point Bo
nita. "The poor. Algoa," he said.
"She's pretty badly battered, but ' I
think we were lucky to get out of that
place at all, though few seem to share
my opinion. Nothing can stand against
those tides. See those dents aft? First
we struck head on, then slid over the
rocks. It seems miraculous that we
ever got off at all."
If the Algoa had not been a com
partment ship the waters of the Golden
Gate would be grinding her sunken
hull against the rocks. Probably with
in a few moments of the first shock
6he would have gone down to join the
Rio Janeiro and others. But the rush
of water that surged throu eh the rent
In her bow only slapped against a.wa
ter tight bulkhead and churned up the
fireworks. Â»VÂ«\! â¢ -
It may be weeks before the prow of
the Algoa will cut deep water again.
She now lies in the drydock at Hunters
Point with a gaping hole under her
bow and numerous dents below the
water line aft. Rough estimates place
the damage at mGre than $75,000.
Like a surgeon making a diagnosis
on a badly wounded patient, Captain
John Metcalf, surveyor for Lloyds,
walked under the enormous hull meas
uring the damaged plates. A trip into
the hold Lliowed that even the massive
iron frame of the freighter had suffered
from the terrific jar that vas received.
From the jagged hole in the bow
thousands of firecrackers, melted into a
slimy pulp, oozed forth and dyed a
large area of the dock red. The rent
was so large that the entire contents
of the forward compartment. were eas
ily dumped through it. Tea, spices,
curios and samples of all the wealth of
the Orient, pounded into a watery
bash, piled up beneath the hole.
From the port side twenty feet of the
vessel's bilge keel was torn and
twisted out of shape. This gives some
notion of the irresistible power of the
tides in the Golden Gate. . .

ALLEGES BOARD
WAS PARTIAL
A meeting of the striking freight
handlers was held yesterday for the
purpose Â°f coming to some final agree
ment. The gathering was dominated by
those who wished to accept the railroad
company's terms anfl return to work.
A number, however, were for continu
ing on strike, but were met with the
argument that without the help of the
teamsters and other workers employed
at freight moving their chances of
making their strike success were
dwindling. The question was put to a
vote, which resulted in a large major
ity deciding to go to work. However,
th* number stopped Just short of a two
thirds result, which was needed for a
decision under the rules, and the mat
ter will be acted upon at the next meet
ing.
Following the lead of E. A. Pierce of
the Nevada stables, W. E. Bridge of
the St. Lawrence stables, 423 Poet
street, will apply to-day for a writ of
temporary injunction to restrain the
SU.Wemen'6 Union from placing pickets
In front of his place of business. This
action will be followed by the rest of
the Bta-bles that have been placarded
a* "unfair" by the union, and the hear
ing of the original case July 1 for per
manent injunction will probably decide
cil euch cases.
The stable owners affirm that they
Â«re determined to conduct their estab
lishments on the open-shop plan, and
are preparing to form themselves into
an association for the purpose of main
taining this system. The Stablemen's
Union Is equally firm In its intention to
bring about the unionizing of the sta
bles. Its active members do not an
ticipate any adverse decision from the
courts next month.
"We are doing pretty well," said Sec
retary Meyer at the stablemen's head
quarters last evening, "if we can in
jure an unfair man's business $1000 a
month with our pickets, as some have
stated. We will therefore stand pat on
this line."
"We intend to run our own stables,'
raid E. G. Pierce of the Nevada, "and
those injunctions will be permanent
Just as soon as we can get them before
the courts."

fully chargeable, and the Tax Collec
tor has no lawful authority to offer the
property for sale.
In asking for a preliminary Injunc
tion the raih-oads offer an undertak
ing . of $3000 to Indemnify the county
against the injunction.
In conclusion, the complaint states
that no such franchises as described in
the pretended assessment or any
franchises of any q(f the ferry systems
ever existed, but that each and all of
the ferries are adjunct and appendages
to and parts of routes of railroads op
erating in more than one county of this
State and that the franchises of said
railroads were, for the year. In which
said pretended assessment was made
in this county, duly assessed by the
State Board of Equalization - and the
taxes duly paid. . .
They set forth that Tax Collector
Smith published in the delinquent list
notices that taxes and penalties were
due on the properties as follows: On
block 43, $2167 36; on block 44, $16,248 20.
and on block 45, $5416 40, and unless
those amounts were paid b> June 23
the property would be sold.
It is stated in the complaint that the
assessments and taxes with the penal
ties against these properties for the
year aggregated $2167 36, set forth as
delinquent against the property. For
the same year the Assessor, it is said,
made a pretended assessment against
the Central Pacific Railroad Company
for the ferry system between the foot
of Market street and Oakland mole for
$750,000. the taxes amounting to $13,
539 75 and with the penalties, $16,248 20,
as set forth in the delinquent list: for
the same year the South Pacific Coast
Railway was assessed on ihe ferry
system between Market street and AJa
meda mole in the sum of $230,000, the
taxes amounting to $4513 and with the
costs and penalties $5416.40.
FRANCHISES DON'T EXIST.
In the complaint filed yesterday the
companies assert their ownership of
blocks 43. 44 and 45 of the South Beach
and Water Side survey, which, they
say, had been assessed to them by the
State Board of Equalization in March.
1903, and upon which they had paid
taxes.
The Southern Pacific and Central Pa
cific Railway companies yesterday aft
ernoon applied to the Superior Court
for an injunction to prevent Tax^ Col- !
lector E. J. Smith from selling certain j
of their real properties to-day at an
advertised delinquent tax sale. It is a i
renewal of the old contention Â¦ of ,the j
railroad companies that their trans- :
bay franchises are assessed by the j
State . Board of Equalization and the :
taxes already paid thereon. ;
Assessor Washington Dodge, when â¢
questioned about the suit last night, i
expressed surprise that the application
for an Injunction should have been '
brought in the Superior Court. "It has i
been the habit," he said, "of. the for- j
eign corporations like the railroads, .-
Wells, Fargo & Co. and others that I Â¦
could name, to bring their suits for in- j
Junction in the Federal court. They i
also have a way of starting 'tie i.mt J
a few hours before the sale in order 1
to hold up the disposition of their prop- f
erty for delinquent taxes, and by the j
time the tuit is heard the rale is over
and there is no provision in the law for
carrying the sale forward." j
