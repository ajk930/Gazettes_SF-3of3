Special Dispatch to The CalL
WASHINGTON, July 10. â In order to
secure labor with which to build the
isthmian waterway the Canal Commis
sion has been forced to adopt the pa-
system and Introduce coolies,
Â«i!>Jo, it had been declared by Secre
tary Taft, never would be employed.
Tbe cummlKxlon acknowledge* itm
Inability to secure the required num
ber of workers throusrh Its own ef
forts and In desperation has turned to
the contractors, who will be naked to
fnrnlsh 2000 each of Japanese, Chinese
and Italian laborers. /
In explanation of the mixture of the
races it Is said that it is desired to ex
periment with the different national
ities to determine which furnishes tha
best workers. . It Is stated that the rep
resentation from each class was fixed
at 2000 because that number can ba
carried on one ship. The laborers will
be imported under contract to remain
for COO working days. In accordance
with tbe decision of the Attorney Gen
eral they will work only eight hours a
\u25a0day. The Government will give them
unfurnished quarters, fuel and water
and medical attendance. Laborers who
go to the Isthmus. will not be allowed
to enter the United Spates unless they
can comply with. tha Immigration laws.
The employment of coolies Is the last
resort through which tha commission
hopes to secure men to dig the canal.
It was at first decided to employ West
Indian negroes, who are accustomed to
the climate, and the commission opened
an Immigration office at' Barbadoes on
January 1 through which it was ex
pected to secure 6000 men without any
difficulty. So great Is the{ fear of
isthmian fever that not more than 1000
iWest Indians have been. Induced to go
to Panama and they were drawn from
all the islands around Barbadoes.
Bids for the coolies will be * called
for as soon as the commission has dis
posed of the legal questions Involved
and made arrangements to protect the
laborers from injustice and oppression
Ls far as possible. \u25a0&\u25a0

STOCKHOLM, July 10.-War between
Sweden- and 'Norway, . with the-Nor
wegians as the aggressors, is declared
to be an imminent danger by. Dr. . Sven
Hedln, the well-known explorer, who has
addressed ,a passionate " appeal to . the
Swedes in America to come to the 1 rescue
of the fatherland by raising a naval
defence fund of $5,000,000. Hedln asserts
that the people of,. Sweden havjs lapsed
into unbelievable apathy with regard to
the. union crisis and require urgently to
have aggressive patriotism preached to
them by Sweden's sons and daughters
across the sea.
Norway, according to Hedin, Is realiz
ing Sweden's indifference and unprepared
ness and is preparing for an attack. It
has made all its plans for falling upon
Sweden when it deems the pyschologlcal
moment shall have arrived.' \u25a0\u25a0-> â¢
"Fellow countrymen in America," says
Hed in's appeal, "incredible, as it may
sound, receive my solemn assurance that
Norway at the present . moment is our
country's single enemy. It is armed to
the teeth by land and sea, with borrowed
foreign capital secured on the pretense
lhat it was wanted for railway construc
tion. An alliance with you, an alliance
of sympathy and substantial support , is
the only alliance Sweden- needs. No mat
ter how light your, financial contribution,
your vigorous initiative would have a
powerful effect |on your drowsy kinsmen
here, whose awakening from the sleep
of fancied security is the imperative need
of Sweden."
Hedin's description of the apathy of
the people eeems only slightly overdrawn.
Whether it Is due to disinclination to mar
the fete in honor of the . home coming
of the heir-presumptive' s bride. Princess
Margaret of - Connaught, - whom "Stock
holm welcomed brilliantly yesterday, or
whether it is born of a realization that
Sweden has to reckon with unalterablo
facts in Chrlstiania, is difficult for the
foreign â¢ observer to "say. ; There is no
douEt, however, that the war spirit^ Is
subsiding. The King" and the â¢â¢ Crown
Prince are said to have succeeded 'in in
spiring the aristocratic and military per
sonages who have hitherto' made up the
war party with' a conviction that ; there
must be no war, except in the event of
a wanton attack by ' Norway.
' Surprisingly little popular Interest Is
manifested In the forthcoming report of
the Riksdag commission,- on which hinges"
the. Question of war and peace. 1 The re
port is expected this, week. *

MRS. McCURDT
NOT IN SIGHT
Mother of Chicago
Bride Also Drops
From View.
With the so-called wife who was the
cause of all his trouble by hl3 side.
George D. Collins, the San Francisco
attorney, who . stands accused of the
crime \u25a0of bigamy and whose trial for
that offense was supposed to proceed
yesterday in the Superior Court of this
city, secretly fled in tno darkness of
lasf'Friday night.^' Worsted In- every*
point of a defense which had been un
usual In the nature and number of
technicalities that it has produced and
seeing an ultimate defeat ahead, with
a term in the penitentiary as the final
punishment, Collins evidently feared to
face the actual trial and before one
man of the Jury had been selected he
stole away with the one ne loved in a
little launch, landed somewhere on the
water . front of Oakland, purchased two
tickets at the Sixteenth-street - station
and boarded the first train for Sacra
mento. His flight was a complete sur
prise. His whereabouts to-day is un
known, for no one, not even those as
sociated with him in business, have re
ceived word from him since 9 o'clock
last Friday night.
MRS. McCURDT DISAPPEARS.
Mrs. Sarah A. McCurdy. mother of
the second wife of Collins, has also
disappeared and the police are search-
Ing for her. She was seen early Sat
urday evening at her residence on Sac
ramento street. No one has been found
who saw. her leave that place, but yes
terday, when Detective Thomas Wren
asked for her she was nowhere to be
found and investigation proves that
she fled : even more secretly than did
her son-in-law and daughter. She
could not have gone with them, for she
was seen after their departure and the
police are of the theory that she is hid
ing within the limits of this city, to
appear only when she feels that Col
lins , and ' his wife are safe from tha
clutches of the law.
. -Warrants .â¢ have been sworn out for
the arrest of George D. Collins, Alisa
Clarice McCurdy and Mrs. Sarah Mc-
Curdy. Their descriptions have been
sent to police headquarters of - many
cities of the United States.' If they are
â¢till within its confines capture is only
a question of a short time the officers
believe. '
COLLINS LEAVES IX I,AI'.\CH.
Three men knew of the departure of
the refugees and accompanied them on
the first stage of their flight. These
ar Â« '. Frank V. Kin gton. attorney and
clerk -In * the . offices of Collins in the
Crocker building; "Bogie" O'Donnell, a
driver of automobiles, and Charles Mc-
Neil, owner of bay launches. The first
two of tfaess appeared in court yester
day and gave their testimony. The
last named has not yet been subpenaed.
According .to their statement Collins
and Miss : McCurdy left their home at
1113 Sacramento street In an automo
bile about " o'clock In the evening of
Friday, July. 7. , O'Donnell and King
ton were In the machine and the party
circled around.' with the evident Inten
tion of escaping observation, .until they
â¢topped at the wharf near the end of
Van Ness avenue. There \u25a0 McNeil was
awaiting .them with a launch and the
party stepped . aboard. . By. an , unusual
route around Alcatraz they were taken
over, to some wharf along the Oakland
water front, arriving about 8 o'clock
that same evening-. There another au
tomobile was in .waiting. Â«
" v O'Donnell and McNeil put back to San
Francisco in the launch and Collins and
his /wife, with; Kington. hurried In the
to Bamum'3 restaurant, Oak
land, where the party dined for nearly
an hour. Into the automobile they got
again [ and were whirled down to" the
Sixteenth-street station, where Kington
purchased the two tickets for Sacra
mento. The train pulled in a moment
later.': and "Collins and his wife _were
fairly .started on their flight. ~ Kington
rode in the automobile back to ;the

Eepeated Questioning by
district Attorney Bying
ton Fails to Reveal Identity
ol' 3fan Wlio Hired Autos
The scene in the courtroom of Judge
Lawlor. where Judge Lemon has been
BiUing in the case of George D. Collins
whenever it has been called, was highly
Latcrtsttns yesterday afternoon when tha
, case came up again. It was 2:30 o'clock,
hail an hour late, when the court opened
the proceedings. Only a short time be
fore Judge Lennon had called District
Attorney Byington and Attorney Thomas
O'Connor, the latter recently appointed
by the court for the defense, to his
chambers for -a consultation. The air
cf rayetery about this hurried meeting
had gathered a large throng, and by the
time Judge Lennon stepped into his place
the rcom was rilled to overflowing with a
mass cf sweltering humanity. 'At first,
lev.- knov.- of the fact that Collins was a
fugitive from justice, but the rumor soon
fcprcad and soon every- one there under
tiood what was in the air. Not one
understood the facts of the hasty flight
of lie alleged bigamist on Friday even
ing, but all knew that they were soon to
be enlightened, and they waited impati
ently.
"The case cf the People against George
D. Collins." said the clerk.
O'COXXOK WITHOUT CLIENT.
Attorney O'Connor for the defense
was on his feet instantly. "I will ask
the court's indulgence for a few mo
ments, " he said, "the defendant has not
yit arrived."
"Where is he?" interrupted District
Attorney Byington. *
"I haven't the slightest idea," re
turned OConnor sa<Sly.
"issue a bench warrant for his ar
rest at once." ordered the Court. "Issue
bench' warrants for Mrs. McCurdy and
the, other woman"â meaning Mrs. Col
lins No. 2. "Subpena Clerk Frank V.
Kington. Harry Michaels, Jacob Meyer
.and" Bogie" O'Donnell. Bring In the
bond for the appearance of the defend
ent. Bailiff, call ihe name of the de
fendant in the hall."
"George D. Collins, George D. Col
lins, George D. Collins, appear in this
court," resounded the voice of Bailiff
Welch through the hail. But there
was no answer. In all probability the
men who failed to reply to that sum
mons was hundreds of miles away, and
speeding farther as fast as steam could
carry him.
An adjournment was then taken un
til 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
Promptly at the hour appointed the
court 'convened for the second time.
Frank V. Kington, attorney, employed
in the ofSees of Collins, was called to
the stand first. Calmly he answered
the questions of District Attorney By
ington. To the eurprlse of every one
lie gave in detail the flight of the ac
cused bigamist from the time that he
left his Sacramento-street home until
"he boarded the train at Sixteenth
F-treet, Oakland.
KISGTOJTS STORY. -
"I last taw Collin* on -Friday night
at Oakland," said Kington, '"as he was
boarding the train. I supposed that
he was on his way to the springs and
did net know that he did not intend to
appear here at his trial.
. "It was on Friday afternoon that
Collins telephoned to me at the office
and told me that he wanted to ccc me
right away. I went out to the house
about 6 o'clock and saw that he was
ready to take his departure somewhere.
Ue told me that I was to come along
*v!th him. I took a wrap from Mrs.
L'ollins and we all walked down to an
(automobile that -was in waiting on
Taylor street- We got In and wÂ«re
triven to a wharf near the foot of A'an

were going because I am not in the
V.abit of asking questions and before

sick.
"He d!d tell me that he took this man

as they were in the habit of doing. I
suspected nothing.
TALKED SOFTLY TOGETHEIV
"At the wharf there was a launch
awaiting us and we all stepped in. Mr.

GIVE DETAILS OF FLIGHT.
At 4 o'clock these witnesses appeared
and the details of the escape of Collins
were heard from their lips. The bond
for J3OOO by which Collins was re
leased immediately after his arrest was
ordered forfeited. " It was signed by
Joseph A. Kelly, a Chinatown' guide;
and Fisher Ames, a 'lawyer, with- offices
in the Hearst building. - The case was
then ordered continued from day to
day until the-defendant * should be
brought into court,' the warrants for his
arrest were again 'ordered issued and
the Police Department Instructed to
use every possible means to effect his
capture.
Word came from. Washington Saturn
day to Jacob S. Meyer of another de^
feat for Collins. He had applied to the
Supreme Court of the United States,
after being- denied by intermediate
courts, for a writ, of habeas corpus.
The telegram says the Supreme Court
has refused to interfere. It is possible
that Collins knew of this j reply, and
that through it he saw his last chance
of escape crushed. Flight, must have
seemed his only means of;avolding the
actual trial, and he availed himself of it,
Joseph A. Kelly,-one; of the ; oien who,
signed the- $5000 bond for the appear
ance of Collins at his trial, said last
night: "I know nothing about the ra
cape of Collins, I. was induced to w go
on his bond by a friend of mine.' I
hardly know the man."
Fisher Ames, the other, bondsman,
would not be .6een ; in regard to,. thÂ«i
flight of the -accused - lawyer. Neither
would he discuss the signing of the
another, automobile waiting for us. We
got out and left the* two men, O'Donnell
and the owner of the launch, in the boat
to take it back to the city.
"We stopped and had a luncheon at
Barnum's restaurant. All this time Col
lins said not a word as to'his destination
and I did not once suspect that he was
running away from his trial. In fact I
thought all the time that he was going
to the springs and would return as he
said ne would. At the Oakland station,
Sixteenth . street, we . stopped. . Collins
gave me the money,, and told me to buy
two tickets to Sacramento. .'\u25a0 I went
feround to the window, and /bought the
tickets. Then the train came along and
they both boarded a sleeping ear. I. rode
to the Mole in the automobile, took a lit
tle ride, with Meyer around San Francisco
and then went to bed in my room at 1118
Sacramento street.
"Since that time I have not heard from
my employer. No. telegram, letter .or
word of an indirect source has reached
me from anywhere. I have no idea where
is now. . ;
O'DO>%XELL IS EVASIVE.
"I last saw Mrs. McCurdy Sunday noon.
I do not know, where she has gone and I
have not heard from her."
District Attorney ByJngton tried t6 get
the reason why Kington had told inquir
ers that Collins was ill in bed.'wherjfhe
knew that the alleged bigamist was miles
away. "I thought that it was none of
their : business," answered the young ..at
torney. VThe newspaper men rang up th>
house and I toid them that Mr. Collins
was .there, but that he was i sick in -his
bed.. I told every one the same story
and I did not think that it was an im
portant matter at .the time." . /", ;
Kington was questioned long and earn
estly as .to who ordereU the automobiles
both in San Francisco and,- at Oakland,
but he professed 1 total ignorance on that
subject- Then "Bogle" O'Donnell was
summoned. . \u25a0 . \u25a0\u0084,---
The testimony of O'Donnell ' gave ,.- the
court no additional facts. The man, who
is some limes a . chauffeur; and . who se
cures cuStomera for others./ gars Â» mass
of confused testimony contradicting hiro
eUf at every tura, He was. evidently, try
ing to be an evasive as possible, and even
Judge Lennon-. indirectly accused him of
giving false testimony., .. J
No effort of the District Attorney, could
make him .tell who ordered the automobile
with" which, the Collins - party ; made its
escape from the house. He would. only
say that a "little man." saw him on the
etrtet and told him to be . at ' the corner
of i Sacramento and Taylor streets/ at 6
o'clock: Friday evening. "It was at jmy,
suggestion." he said, "that. we went for a
little ride In, the launch. Mr. Collins had
told me that he was going to the springs
and I said that the air of the bay would
help .him...* He -did not;order the launch.?
The rest of his testimony; was corrobora
tive, of Kington'f. ,

he left the train after he had covered

â¢either in "disguise or from ario.ther.

Saturday. Another is that he went" by
train, to Canada or Mexico. " In many

has extradition treaties nearly all of

the -perpetrators /of \u25a0. them must be re-r

CHEAPER FOR PACIFIC POINTS.
The Government is under Just as great ob
ligations *to handle promptly and . efficiently
the carso intrusted to Its care as It Is to press
the mirk of canal construction, and every ef
fort should be made by \u25a0 the Panama Railroad
not only to fulfill Its obligations to the Canal
Commission, but. to commerce as well. :X: X V
-.The proposition that sinee -thÂ« Government
Is required to operate this road as "a commer
cial . line it ought to , improve its facilities so
as to make it of the greatest possible benefit
to commerce is the one most generally ap
proved by the shipping public.
*. The operation. of- thU railroad is no mow in
competition with private enterprise than the
construction . and operation of the * canal are
in competition with .private enterprise ; â¢ and tf
products can be between the At
lantic and Pacific coasts -at less coat by this
line than by any. other, then commerce should
receive ' the benefits of . this route.
It is the common opinion that If traffic had
been invited from competing steamship lines on
both sides, the railroad properly equipped and
Us facilities improved \u25a0 and enlarged, it would
nave handled a much larger and more profitable
business. \u25a0_â¢-\u25a0\u25a0- ~\:-^-.,< .--.*â¢ - . \u25a0\u25a0 . ;
It appears that over 10O.C0O tons of Hawaiian
sugar are unloaded annually: from ships at San

to Galveston by railroad, and reshipped by
steamer to New York. â¢ If proper facilities ex

certainly s .would; be .cheaper; to shlp.lt direct

,8."5 P ., Schwerln. ,vieÂ« president and genera!
manager- of thÂ«, Pacific Mall Steamship Com
pany, etat^s that the operation of an Ameri

than that. of. a line under a foreign flag, tha
difference consisting * In greater cost -of con
struction and repairs of steamers, higher wages
for the ! crew and ; larger salaries tor the of fl

ships be given through bills of lading north ot
Panama.
. I would be, glad to see American ships fa
vored when it can consistently bÂ« done, but tha
treaty by which \u25a0 the canal is constructed pro
vides that there shall ] 6Â«_po discrimination
against the vessels of any -nation In respect
to conditions or charges on traffic and other
wise, and, upon the theory that the railroad
is . performing the functions .of the -canal, - In
so far. as a railroad can do so. It doÂ«s not ap
pear practicable to show any discrimination in

\u25a0 In conclusion. . therefore, I would recommend
that the Panama Railroad be continued as a
commercial \u25a0 line;: that ; its r facilities for hand

double-tracked and ; re-equipp^d with modern

"That if, within a reasonable time, s> regular

negotiations and Count Muravieff as one
of tae envoys was to gain time. He hoped
that, in the meantime, the interior trou
bles would subside and that General Line
vitch. having been reinforced, would show
the Russians in a favorable light in the
field.
Events have upset these calculations.
The country is torn by revolution. Mos
c c^f itself threatens to name a provisional
government. Japan has now occupied the
Island of Saghalien and brought war into
Russian territory- General Hasegawa is
hastening to invade the province of Us
suri and thus the Japanese envoys will
have the right to demand the cession of
territory.
Muravieff will now proceed to Wash
ington at once. The Czar also will leave
for Moscow. He will invite the various
Mayors of the cities now in conference
there to meet him at the Illinsky Palace,
where he will declare his readiness to
yield to their request for reforms and
will ask for their support.
M. Witte, president of the committee
of Ministers, was strongly urged upon the
Emperor for head cf the peace mission.
Even Foreign Minister Lamsdorn* is un
derstood to have joined in recommending
his election. The Czar, however, flatly
declined to appoint him.
The Emperor has received from Gen
eral Linevitch another very optimistic
dispatch on the military situation and
the section of the court party still fav
orable to a continuation of the war is
making much of It.
According to gossips of the imperial
e;itourage. the Dowager Empress is op
posing the conclusion of peace.

ROUMANIA IN A PREDICAMENT.
Russia Insixts Upon the Surrender of
the Potemkine'* Crevr.
'.ST. PETERSBURG. July 10.âNego
tiations between Russia and Roumania
on the question of the surrender of the
crew of the Kniaz Potemkine are in
progress. Russia is disposed to insist
upon "the surrender of the men not as
political prisoners, to which Roumania
will agree, but as criminals guilty of
murder and theft. There were several
hundred thousand roubles on board the
liattleship, \u25a0which the crew divided
when they left the ship. The Rouman
ian , Government Is somewhat embar
rassed by the fact that it promised the
mutineers if they surrendered they
would be treated as deserters.

GRISCOM GETS
LOOMIS' PLACE
â¢ Young Diplomat Is to Be
come First Assistant to
Secretary of State Koot
CHANGE IX METHODS
Time - Saving System to
Be Introduced in â¢ the
Reorganized Department
Epeclal DUsatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDIXG,
WASHINGTON. July 10â It is generally
believed in official circles In Washington
that President Roosevelt has practically
decided to appoint Lloyd Griscom, present
United States Minister to Japan, to the
position cf First Assistant Stcretary of
State, to succeed Francis B. Loomis. who
probably will receive a diplomatic ap
pointment. Should the President appoint
Griscom to the Stare Department, it is
likely the department would be reor
ganized.
' With Mr. Root, who is very fond of
system and of every new method which
will save time and increase efficiency, at
the head cf the department and Griscom,
* a young man, full of energy and vigor,
well versed in practical business meth
ods, as his first assistant, it is quite likely
\u25a0 that the method of doing business at the
! State Department will be radically
* charged.
The State Department has always been
unfortunate in obtaining appropriations
from Congress. Mr. Root will take up the
fight for larger appropriations next ses
sion, and those who know him best be
lieve he will be entirely sucessful in get
ting what other Secretaries failed to
.\u25a0ret.
Mr. Root was very successful in or
ganizing the War Department when he
* first took charge of that department and
his experience in that work, should stand
him In good stead in the organization of
the Department of State.
POTRERO CITIZENS AWAKE
TO PROSPERITY'S KNOCK
Form Improvement Club and Prepare to
Ride on the Wave of Progress
Thnt Has Arrived.
Progress and commerce having recent
â¢ly -invaded the sunburnt hills of Potrcro
Heights, and the waters beneath them,
the property owners and residents have
organized an improvement club for the
Â£>ettennent of their section of the muni
â¢'dpality. The club held a meeting last
night to which the city officials were in
* vited to sit in friendly conference as to
the many Improvements needed in view
, *cf the advanced manufacturing interests
of the section south cf Division street.
The meeting was presided over by
Frank Weiss, and H. B. Davidson was
secretary. Both are thoroughly conver
sant with the needs of the district they
represent.
The presence of Supervisor Bent, B. H.
Afeeltinger and Thomas F. Eagan of the
Board of Public Works and Thomas P.
Woodward, City Surveyor, added an of
ficial dignity to the meeting, which was
"attended by prominent residents of the
hillside territory.
The neglected condition of the Potrero
was forcibly brought to the minds of
, those officials by the speakers. The ex
â¢ttnsion of Eighth street from its inter
section with Rhode Island to Carolina
, â¢etreet, across the dumps, was pointed out
-as a necessity, in view of the fact that
'the Southern Pacific Company had
gobbled up the right of way over
Seventh street. A two-block obstruction,
running through the flats must be pur
chased by the city for the extension of
Eighth street as mapped out by the club
* members.
The caretaking and watering of Ken
tucky street is another needed requisite
* to protect property and bring health and
happiness to the people owning property
and residing on this street.
Free access to the whole of Army
street, without railroad tracks and sub
stantial bridges on the crossing of Ten
nessee, Nineteenth, Twentieth and lowa
streets are demanded. Last, but not
least, the removal of the ugly hump of
blue rock on Kentucky and Twentieth
streets, which Is on city property Is
asked.
.To Camp at Paciflc Grove.
The Salvation Army will hold Its an
nual provincial encampment this year
at Pacific Grove from August 4 to 21.
A large tent city will be pitched there.
Business and pleasure will be com
bined. In addition to the regular evan
gelistic meetings which are to be held
four times a day, there Is to be what
they term a summer school of the
prophets. Prices for accommodation at
the camp have been fixed at a low rate
and the railroad company has made a
special rate for traveling:.

GERMANY CLAIMS
THE VICTORY.
TRIUMPHS OVER FRANCE
FRENCH STATESMAN* AXD GERMAN DIPLOMAT WHO CONDUCTED THE -
NEGOTIATION'S THAT HAVE RESULTED IN A PEACEABLE ADJUSTMENT
OF THE DIFFERENCES CONCERNING MOROCCO.
BERLIN, July 10.â The agreement be
tween France and Germany on the sub
ject of Morocco, which was made public
in both Paris and Berlin to-day, can
not but be regarded here as a diplomatic
success of the first importance over both
Great Britain and France. Although the
agreement is executed in terms of great
moderation, tbe agreement being referred
to as "an accord baseo. on a full appre
ciation and recognition of each ' Govern
ment's rights and aims," it is regarded
as a triumph for Emperor . William and
Prince yon Bulow that will strengthen
Germany's diplomacy everywhere on the
continent.
The attitude of the American Govern
ment toward the Moroccan controversy
was . always satisfactory to Germany.
Precisely what part President Roosevelt
tooÂ£ in forwarding the settlement is not
made public in Berlin, but it is appre
ciated that the influences he exerted in
Paris and London contributed toward the
settlement.
T^e documents covering the Franco-
German Moroccan agreement are three in
number, all dated July 8. The first Pre
mier Rouvier wrote to Prince yon Rad
olln, the German Embassador at Paris,
saying that the French Government,
through the discussions that had taken
place between the representatives of both
countries In Paris and Berlin, had reached
the conviction that, *as the ' conference
proposed by the Sultan of Morocco "was
directed toward no aim opposed to the in
terests of France in Morocco, nor to her
defined rights, nor In opposition to her
treaties or engagements, France gave her
assent to the conference with these fun
damental principles: The sovereignty and
independence of the Sultan, the integrity
of his kingdom, the usual economic
freedom, the necessity for police and
financial reforms and their . introduction
for a short period on the basis of an "in
ternational agreement and the acknowl
edgment of the fact that France " had
especial Interests In having order rule in
Morocco, because \u25a0of the long ', frontier
trouble between Algeria and Morocco

and the resulting neighborly relations.
Prince yon Radolin replied that his Gov
ernment authorized him t to : confirm his
oral representatlOTis that"*, the â¢ proposed
conference would not follow aims in op
position to French interests, continuing
to the encL of . the note in the precise
language" used by Rouvier. '
The third document is a declaration
signed by Rouvier and Prince yon Rado
lin that the two Governments had agreed
to recall their legations at Tangier as
soon as the conference met at '-Fez and
to Jointly advise the Sultan to prepare a
programme to be, laid before the inter
national conference in accordance with
the principles set forth in the letters ex

spected ,' the new : .; Government v station
there and gave ! some attention to immi

subject \u25a0 last nightj 1 Commissioner Sargent
said the people jof I Hawaii J are" at : present
deeply concerned in " the \u25a0 exodus "of Jap
anese from the islands. â¢ ' He said : t
While I was there 1000 Japanese left' Hon
olulu for the United States, some going by way
of '. Victoria and others ; via Vancouver \iand
Seattle. : The British steamer: Stanley Dollar
was "\u25a0\u25a0 also sent - there under contract â¢to take
800 Japanese to Victoria, j the understanding
being i' that : the majority <of her ;. passengers
would later enter the -.United States, by way of
Seattle.
Personally lam sorry '; to j see * the ' Japanese
leaving-the, island*,; for there is a searcity>of
labor there. : and - this z fact, s with ?. the ' : present
exodus of the Orientals, I is : naturally | causing
much uneasiness among the planters- and busi
ness men generally. : I think that. the Japanese
would better their i condition Â»~ by ,r, r remaining
there : more than i they : will by \ coming to the
mainland, but they take a different view of. the
matter, a. fact I , gleaned during; talks : with^e
Japanese, who said they only intended to re

HENEY JTAKES A REPLY
Asserts That Uncle Sam Did

Charges Against Oregonian
PORTLAND, July 10.â Counsel for
United States Senator Mitchell, In an
arg-usient to-day before Judge de Haven
in the Federal Court on & motion Tor a
new trial, laid great stress on the fact
that the Government did not prove the
elxth count of the Indictment, wherein
It Is alleged that on January 4, 1304, Sena
tor Mitchell received a sum of money
from Kribs. It was argued that inas
much as the Jury vtsls Instructed that It
could bring a verdict upon any one or all
cf the counts and was not Instructed to
except the unproved count, the whole
verdict Is defective and should be set
aside and a new trial allowed.
District Attorney Heney replied that the
Government did not from the beginning
cf the trial expect to prove this count
and had Informed the Jury to that effect.
And further, he said the Jury had been
given to understand several times that
the Government was not attempting to
make a case on this particular count.

during which he practically followed the
same lines as Senator Thurston, who

HEAT KILLS INMATES

Death of Twenty-One Luna
tics Due to Recent
Hot Spell.
EpecUl Dlapatch to Tb* CalL
STOCKTON', July 10.â Twenty-one fÂ»v
taliUes due to the hot weather have oc
curred at the Stockton State Hospital for
the Insane within the last seven days.
The record is something unprecedented.
Dr. A: W. Hclsholt of the medical stait
of the State Hospital stated this after
noon that never in the history of the
hospital have there been so f"Â»"y deaths
In one week.
"We always expect more deaths during
the hot weather," stated Dr. Holsholt.
"But this Is something entirely unpre
cedented. Among our patients who are
afflicted with blood vessel diseases or cf
apopletic tendencies deaths are quite fre
quent during the hot weather. The heat
causes hemorrhages and a clogging up of
the blood vessels and death ensues. Since
July 4. which was the second day, we
have had twenty-one deaths. That Is an
average of three a day. I think all of
these may be attributed to the heat. The
average death rate at the hospital is from
ten to twenty a month. We have more
than exceeded that amount In but seven
days."

ARE YOU TIRED OF PAYING
BLUNDER TAXES?
Many a business man pays as much
ffconey for the luxury of blundering
&s" a steam yacht or private touring
car would cost
"Blunder Taxes" cannot be evaded
â¢â whatever else waits, these must be
paid. If a business man gets into the
fcabit of making the same blunders
more than once, the taxes will soon
amount to confiscation.
"Blunder Taxes" are levied with
amazing frequency upon store adver-
tisers. Among the blunders which
ere assessed at "full value" in adver-
tising are these:
Selection of poor mediums;
Using too little^ space in good
Devoting less^ attention to preparing
the dally /store-advertisement
than to the storing of some
empty boxes in the basement ;
Stopping the ad. altogether for one
, or more weeks now and then ;
P? : ~""".ring the advertising appro-
trialion on the basis of what
you can " afford" after all
other expenses are provided for;
Use of " programmes," 'schemes,
circulars, posters, fence-signs;
placards and jim-cracks, under
the impression that you are se-
curing real publicity, and that
somehow, somewhere, sometime,
someone will be influenced by
some of these things to come to
your-store and buy something.

a man named Hayes and rented to J.
Price has been completely burned over.
Other cattle ranches in the path of the
fire hare also suffered heavily.
This afternoon the fire was within
eight miles of Lick Observatory, but be
fora It can reach the observatory it
will have to leap the \ Santa Ysabel
Creek. Ranchers In the Mount Hamilton
hills have been fighting the flames all
day. The fire Is the worst that has ever
occurred In this range of hills. The loss
will run up Into the thousands, as there
will be - a heavy loss _of cattle, ranch
houses and hay.
D. B. Pegg this afternoon telephoned to
Captain Hoi turn of Company B, N. G. C,
asking that organization to come out and
help fight the fire. Captain Holtum at
once communicated the matter to Gover
nor Pardee, but had not received orders
to go up to late this afternoon.

Observatory state that the fire In the
mountains near there Is still burning.
The blaze has crossed the Ptolemy
ridge, some five miles northeast of the
observatory. There Is no danger of the
observatory burning. The fire would
have to cross two streams before It
could strike the observatory reserva
tion and then only some small out
buildings would be damaged. A large
force from adjoining ranches Is fight-
Ing the flames.

BALTIMORE, July â¢ 10.â The Christian

the collective work â¢of the - various En

Heliglon," speaking in part .as : follows :
Many years ago a story wu told of a
well-known professional politician In this city,
new dead, who on his return from church ono
.Sunday was met by. a newspaper \, reporter,

"Mr. B," replied the statesman, "I never
mix up politics and religion." . . .
: -Of "late- years the American people have
shown , a disposition - sufficiently . plain to be
widely remarked to act' upon. a different prin
ciple. Many of our citizens are beginning |to
"mix up" a good deal of. what my late fellow

STORM RAGING
IN NOME CITY
Streets of the Alaska Town
â¢ Converted Into Lakes and
Great Damage Is Done
SEATTLE. July 10.â Advices received
to-day 'from .Nome say a disastrous
storm has been raging there for. several
days. River street has been converted
into a lake, some inundations of cellars
have occurred, ; and the beach has re
ceived a thorough and much - needed
clearing. The greatest damage, however,
has resulted in the creeks. Nome, Penny
and the Kuzltrim rivers are unusually
high. The Kougarok and the streams in
Its vicinity are raging torrents, while the
flood in Anvil Creek beats all records.
The dams of Nos. 5 and 8 are gone, ana
the ditch of the Pioneer Company above
Banner Station burst its bounds. The
water, tearing down the hillside, washed
out part of the railway, which, however,
has been repaired. On No. 3 above dis
covery on Dry Creek a dam has been
swept off, and Denhart's ditch also suf
fered. Many dams on Dexter gave way.
The Solomon district is the largest suf
ferer, the fine bridge at the East Fork
having been ; destroyed. â¢ and the railroad
washed out in several places, especially
along the beach.
Much damage was caused to the proper
ty- of the Miocene Company on Glacier.
Everything had been put in shape for the
commencement .of \u25a0 the . summer's work,
when the creek rose so much and so un
expectedly that the company's pit, which
had ' been .. worked . by . the hydraulic lift,
was some twenty feet deep. The removal
of the "dead" stuff and the delay and
disarrangement of the preliminary work
will cause a loss to the company of an
amount certainly in the thousands.
The camp of the Midnight Sun Min
ing and Ditch Company is under water
and lumber for eighty sluice boxes, the
company's property, has been carried
off. .Two lighters broke away from
the steamship Olympia, one comlru?
ashore at Solomon and the other land
ing about four miles away, while the
ferry cable at Safety Is destroyed and
traffic stopped in consequence.
The splendid new wharf of the Nome
Arctic Railway Company has stood the
test gallantly. A few pieces of crib
bing gave- way, but as many men were
employed to repair the dam and to add
thousands of sand bags to the doubtful
parts of the foundations, nothing seri
ous happened.
..The King Hurst, which has been
blocked up at the water's edge down
near the'Boyd building in preparation
for launching, has suffered much. She
fell jan | easy - victim Ito the rising tide
and now. lies stern to. full of water.
Ophir Creek at Council City is ; prob
ably "out ; of business." The railroad
bridge at No. 15 is gone and about three
miles of track is washed out.
The Hunter pipe line across the Neuk
luk River .is demolished. ' There two men
nearly lost their lives. A scow on which
they were broke - away,, but they man
aged to reach a great tailing pile . In tne
middle of the river from .which they
were rescued by a boat from shore.
â¢ Seyerin BJornson, who was returning to
Nome from a fishing: trip, was caught In
the storm. . His boat was partly swamped
and he was washed overboard. A crew
from the Nome : boathouse rescued the
drowning man.
BANK IN HANDS
OF A RECEIVER
St. Louis Institution Against
Which Fraud Order Was
Issued May Pay Depositors
AFFAIRS IN FAIR SHAPE
Loss Will Fall Upon Stock
holders. Who Will Receive
Fifty Cents on the Dollar
ST. LOUIS, July 10.â Immediately after
taking charge of the affairs of the Peo
ple's United States Bank, former Judga
Selden P. Spencer, who was to-day ap
pointed receiver by the St. Louis County
Circuit Court, sent orders to the deposi
tories of the bank in other cities, about
fifty In number, directing them to dis
continue the Issuance of money on checJt
and to report at once the amount or
money on hand credited to the People's
Bank.
- Judge Spencer then took up the Investi
gation of the bank's accounts and, as
sisted by several experts, made a hur
ried search of the institution's books and
to-night issued a statement of liabilities
and assets. Included in the loans and
discounts are the following Items con
sidered of doubtful value or liable to
shrinkage. An uninsured note given by
Lewis and the old directors for $116,375
representing the promotion and organiza
tion expenses of the bank; a loan of S3SO.
000 secured by stock of the Lewis Pub
lishing Company; a loan of $234,169 se
cured by stock of the University Heights
Realty Company. The balance of $138,020
is made up of smaller miscellaneous
items, many of them notes .indorsed by
Lewis.
When - Judge Spencer arrived at the
bank building, he was met by President
Lewis who * made the following formal
protest against the action of the court:
"I, acting as president of this bank, do
protest against said order, as not Just
and in every way prejudicial to the inter
ests of both stockholders and depositors,
and do surrender said bank and Its assets
only under protest and in obedience to
said order of the honoable court."
After Judge Spencer had taken control.
a meeting of the board of directors of
the bank was called, at which the fol
lowing were present and signed the set
of resolutions protesting against the ap
pointment of a receiver by the court and
the issuance of a fraud order by the
United States postal authorities: Theo
dore F. Meyer, former Governor Lon V.
Stephens, W. F. Carter, James F. Coyle,
E.G. Lewis. ,
State Bank Examiner R. McCook to
night declared the affairs of tha" People's
United States Bank were in no very com
plicated condition. He said:
"According to an examination made of
the assets and liabilities I believe the re
ceiver now would be able to pay all the
depositors In full and have enough left
to pay the stockholders 50 cents on the
dollar.
Judge Spencer, the receiver, places a
more liberal estimate on the bank's abil
ity to pay stockholders. He stated that,
allowing for shrinkage in the collateral,
the stockholders might receive 73 cents on
the dollar. , ,

Albert Stanley of University
of Michigan Talks on "Kea

Kespect of Fellow Men"
AUDIENCE ALL EARS
AS BEMARKS^FALL
Speaker Says Eccentricities
Should Be Abandoned if
Makers of Sweet Sound
Wish for Honor Due Them
â¢ BERKELEr, July 10. â Before an
Htidience of musicians and students of
music that filled his lecture room to
overflowing. Professor Albert Stanley of
the University of Michigan this after
noon created a sensation by 'discussing
the "Reason Why Musicians Do Not
Win the Respect of Their Fallow Men."
Beginning his lecture with a few
commonplace remarks that gave no
bint of the sensation that was to come
later. Professor Stanley caught bis
hearers unawares, so that when the
first few words of his startling sen
tences were wafted out through the
hail music teacher* and music dilet
tantes in the audience woke, with a
start, eat bolt upright and caught their
breath in astonishment, while a slender
figure in gray at the other end of the
room coolly referred to "the efforts of
musicians to inspire respect for them
selves ;is a class," and the reasons why
they failed in this attempt.
Professor Stanley is aÂ» big figure in
the musical world, and particularly
where musical education is concerned.
He speaks with authority about those
things that pertain to miisic and musi
cians. His position is deemed to be so'
â¢well established that he could not be
regarded as a bidder for notoriety by
attacking musicians as a class. It was
apparent, then, that this afternoon he
meant what he said, and bo the audi
ence promptly sat up and wondered.
AUDIENCE ASTONISHED.
There were no signs in the audience
that any member of the crowd consid
ered herself or himself as a failure In
the art of winning the respect of the
world. The ladies were music teachers
for the most part, and they were evi
dently astonished fcii the thought of any
one Imagining that the world failed to
respect them. The idea!
What could Professor Stanley mean?
The professor, ignoring the astonish
ment, did not even smile at the commo
tion he had caused, but continued his
remarks, saying .gravely:
When I have been present at conventions
of musicians and heard resolutions read, the
effect of which was expected to be the (?aining
of respect for musicians as a class I have
been amazed at the idea of such action belns
ttken. The resolutions that may be adopted
under euch circumstances are hardly calculated
in impress the world with their desirability
and always they Ignore the underlying cause
nÂ£ such lack of regyect for musicians as may
exist.
Why are musician* not respected? Why Is
there a feeling that they are, perhaps a
fast "queer"? Why doeÂ» a body of musicians
find it necessary to pass resolutions that will
dissipate the idea' that musicians are unlike
ether wise, smart, sensible people?
I will tell you. Musicians too often know
nothing but music. They learn something â
lÂ«Â«=n!blr a good deal â of mtjÂ«ie. and' there they
stop. They do not fancy, apparently, that it
i.< -necessary or desirable to know those things
\u25a0which lielp to balance men's and women's
faculties. Thus they become, too often, ec
ctutrlc. They are not rounded out. They
heyÂ» peculiarities that could be avoided and
rhould ba. Into such gross extravagances do
these eccentricities sometimes go that the per
petrators loss, in part at least, the respect of
that world In which we live.
CHITICIZKS ECCE.VmiCITIES.
Instead of mueicians adopting resolutions in
convention in erdcr to win people's respect,
let them brosden out. be fully matured, well
rvtindfd out -men and womm. Then the
etirma that conic ted is attached to> the title
cl ."musician ' will mo?t lUcely disappear.
Then thÂ» respect that Is desired win, be won.
It dU t<e a laFtlnr respect and -one that \u25a0is
deserved. -*-\u25a0â¢ ;\u25a0*Â» - â -~- "."
Following the disquisition upon this
topic. Prof cspor Stanley Informed his
hearers that th* subject of music is the
one 6ub.lect in the public school currfc
ulum that is taught by pcrspns "who
know absolutely nothing about It. He
d*>clared his belief that the so-callod
"American tone" or accent Is the result
of imprrfect teaching of music in: the
public schools, nnd the same cause Is
re^ronFlbU- for the comparative lack of
pood or great singing voices in this
country.

Ambition of Singer

Its Way.
OAKLAND. July 10.â When Cupid
beckons, ambition is oft forgotten, or

voice that has frequently been heard at
society functions and for charity's sake,

she chosen the stage. But church and

DYNAMITE CAP
Lad Nearly Loses His Life
Through Curiosity to See
the Effect of Explosion
OAKLAND, July 10.â Curiosity to see
what the effect would be of the explo
sion- of a dynamite, cap nearly cost Joe
York a school boy, his life this afternoon.
Hia i -faces and .client \yrere lUled with small
pieces of tlieiarasV- casing "arid the finger
with which he. touched a lighted, match
to the explosive was mangled. He. got
the cap at the quarry where some work
men were blasting and taking it into the
back yard of. his home at 664 Fourth
street proceeded to touch it off.
The caps are charged heavily enough
to explode the stick of dynamite in which
they are inserted, but the. lad says he
thought that at most the explosion would
only equal an ordinary firecracker. Ha
was' taken to the Receiving Hospital,
where. Dr.'A. S. Kelly spent an hour In
picking the foreign , particles out of the
lad's anatomy and patching up his Index
linger, along which a large piece had
ploughed its way. ' The breaking of the
cap into small pieces, it was stated, was
what saved the boy's life, for had it gone
all together in one direction it might
have killed him. / . .' \u0084\u25a0 â¢, \u25a0""'.*â¢' :' K '~ .': ; r^:

of the Annoying Insect
ORDINANCE IS PASSED
Reward of $50 Will Be Paid
for Conviction of Negli
gent Owners of Property
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN MATEO, July ; 10.â So much good
has resulted from public effort to destroy
the . mosquito - pest in and around San
Mateo that every endeavor will be made
to Induce private property owners to lend
their aid to end the visits of the danger
ous and annoying Insect. Largely through
the instrumentality of the Board of Trade
of . the city an ordinance was passed by
the County Board of Supervisors making
It a misdemeanor for. any one. to maln^
tain mosquito-breeding pools on his prop
erty. V '-. ,; v ' : \ \u25a0';\u25a0;\u25a0 \u25a0, :
This ordinance is not . being enforced as
rapidly as It. should be and some of the
excellent work done' by ithe general comr
munity/ Is v being undone by negligent
property .owners. The San Mateo Park
Improvement Club "now offers a reward
of 150 for the arreat and conviction of any
person ; violating ' the , ordinance. The au
thorities are In earnest, as the elimination
of i the â¢ , mosquito has been one of the
greatest boons to the county in years. If
citizens will simply obey a reasonable
law the pest will be entirely "removed
from the coÂ«nty in a comparatively short
time. .

PJJBB BLOOD
INSURES A CLEAR SKIN
When Eczema, Acne, Tetter, Pimples,
or other skin diseases make their appear-
ance it is a sure sign that the blood is
filled with humors and burning acids,
trhese being forced through the pores
end glands bum and blister the skin, pro-
ducing the eruptions which are usually
accompanied with intense itching, and
are disfiguring and humiliating.
Years a&ro my blood was bad, as cviÂ«
denced by skin eruptions on different
parts of the body, and other symptoms,
bo I concluded to try S. 8. S., knowing it
to be highly epokenof. After using a
number of bottles â do not remember now
Just how muchâ my blood was thor-
oughly purified and enriched and I was
relieved of all eruptions and manifesta-
tions of impure blood. I believe S. S. S.
to be an excellent blood medicine, and
any one In need ot such a medicine
"would do well to use It. They will find
it a perfect cure as it provod to bein my
caseT MBS. C. E. SHOEMAKEB.
Alliance, 0., 516 _. Patterson St.
While external treatment relieves tem-
porarily it does not reach the real cause
of the disease, because it does not go into
the blood. S. S. S. , a perfect blood pu-
rifier, neutralizes these acids and humors,
and by strengthening and toning up the
Liver, Kidneys and Bowels, the natural
channels of bodily waste,- disposes of
._\u25a0 r . them instead of
âj** : skin. . S. S. S. IS
PURELY VEGETABLE, -c greatest -ci
all tonics for
building up the entire system, increasing
the appetite and helping the digestion.'
S. S. S. cures all skin diseases' promptly
and permanently, leaving the skin soft
and smooth. Only by keeping the blood
pure can we^ hope to have a clear skin.'

SCEOJYLKILL AESENAL
TO BE INVESTIGATED
Goyernment Said to Have
Lost Millions on
Contracts.
PHILADELPHIA, July 10.â The Public
Ledger to-morrow, will say that work on
200,000 dress coats contracted for through
the" Schuylkiir, Arsenal , here has been
stopped by a' peremptory order of Quar
termaster General Humphreys In Wash
ington and that a thorough investigation
of the affairs a,t that arsenal has been
begun. ; Continuing, â¢ the Ledger will say:
Because of conditions under which
contracts are given out at . the . arsenal,
nearly half of the dress coats in question
have been manufactured v and paid for.
They lie idle in the storehouse at the de
pot; and, in the opinion of experts of tha
Government ; who j have examined them,
they : are absolutely worthless. A con
tract f or .' : about 200,000 pairs of dress
trousers Is in the hands of the manufac
turers. V Stoppage on this work is ex
pected within a few days. It is believed
that the '. investigation which has ' been
started .will show - that the Government
has lost. to the extent of millions "of dol
lars by the methods 'in vogue here."

UNEASINESS IN INDIA.
IT is not unnatural that the subject races of Asia should show
signs of chafing in their bonds, since the rise of Japan. It is^to
be expected that India should show some traeasiness. But that
there is not much danger of a general revolt there may be safely
assumed. Japan is a homogeneous country. The people originally
of two races, the conquerors and the aborigines, are completely
amalgamated and have common religious and patriotic sentiments.
On the other hand India is a museum of races. There is evidence
that for ages before the invasion of the white Aryans these races
had fought for mastery over each other. The Aryans, by war or
policy, made conquest of most of them, and India became subject
to foreign masters. Alexander with his. Greeks mastered most
of ' Western India and established cities, of which* Hyderabad re
mains to this day. The Scythians, ancestors of the terrible Cos
sacks, took their turn at conquest and rule, and then the furious
Arab Mahometans appeared and were masters in their turn, to be
superseded by the hordes of Timur, whose descendants established
the Mogul empire, and sat on the Peacock throne.
The Indians have had religion as their master motive from
the remote past. Tho benign philosophy of Buddha appealed to
them. Buddhism was made the state religion by Asoka, and in its
rise and reign furnished a history that has been closely followed
by the history of Christianity. Even the Buddhistic myths, be
ginning with the miracles attending the birth of Gautama, the ap
pearance at that event of a new star in the sky and the coming
of wise men to worship the infant, all have their analogues in the
Christian story.
Buddhism and Brahmanism had merged, on the Indian main
land, into the existing system of Hinduism, and distinctive Bud
dhism had fled to Ceylon, Burmah, Tibet, China and Japan, as
the Mogul power rose and flourished. Mahometanism, propagated
by the missionary sword and torch, threatened with extinction all
the other religions of the great peninsula, when Great Britain ap
peared on the scene as a new invader. It is interesting to note that
Alexander and the Greeks found the Indians a strangely truthful
people, without guile or deceit. Transformed by the oppression of
so many races of foreign masters, the British found them to be in
veterate liars and full of deceit. That moral condition is always the
sign of a weak people. Incapable of physical defense, they resort
to deception as a means of protection.
Great Britain pursued in India the -wise policy that made
Rome the master of the world, by recognizing all forms of religion
and protecting the sectaries against each other. It is believed and
stated by intelligent Indians that only the appearance of Great
Britain as master prevented devastating religious wars of exter
mination. Native scholars and Princes, Brahmins and Parsees,
Jains and Mahometans, admit that the English are the best of the
many masters who have overrun the country. In this is the safety
'of English rule. The multitudes of native races have but little in
common. Any one of them, made master by revolution, would at
tack the religion of all the rest.
These, instigated by. motives of revenge, would invite another
foreign master, and the history that stretches from Aryan to Eng
lish occupation would be simply written again. The competitor of
Great Britain for the possession of India is Russia, and the history
of Russia as a conqueror has no features that will move India to
make such a change.
England *has endeavored to improve the material condition of
the people, which is still very low. Railroads' have. been built, irri
gation established and efforts made to make adequate and sure the
food supply of the people. But while much has been done, more
is desirable, and the people have no assurance that it will be given
by a change of masters.
Lord Kitchener has. contributed to a feeling of unrest by; his
impeachment of the military strength of Great Britain in India.
But the present army in India outmatches the natives far more than
the army of Give at the decisive battle of Plassy. Since the Sepoy
rebellion no native has been permitted to handle artillery or become
in the slightest degree familiar, with the operation of cannon. At
every British post the artillery is served solely by English soldiers,
"and this alone would render an uprising futile. With the English
forces are incorporated many native regiments of infantry and cav
alry. The corps of Sikhs has been sent on foreign service, as in
China during the Boxer war, and has proved loyal and well dis
ciplined. - \u0084 â¢ ,"\u25a0Â»
If India intended to attempt to throw off the British yoke the
opportunity occurred during the war in the Transvaal. England
had her hands more than full for a long time, in the gallant, re
sistance put up by the Boers. The suggestion, originating in con
tinental Europe, went to the Indians that the time was favorable
fgr them to move against their masters. The reply was a frank
declaration of loyalty to the British, in which Hindu, Jain and Ma
hometan joined. That critical point is past. England is much
stronger now, and if she were not, the mixture of races, motives,
languages and religions in India is such as to render a concerted
movement against British rule impossible. The Mahometans would
be the most likely to try it, but their former mastery is remembered
and its return is feared. Rather than armed revolution in Asia it
may be expected that the success of Japan will the scholars
and men of thought in affairs to the imitation of Japan in the as
similation of the arts of western civilization to the betterment of
the teeming millions of people.
MORE FOREST FIRES.
THE late hot spell had added to it the terror of timber fires in
the mountains. There were conflagrations on both sides of
the north fork of the American River, and between the Bear
and the Yuba, that burned over square miles of country. There
ought to be some way to stop the carelessness or the crime that
causes this terrible destruction of property; if setting out these
fires is not a felony it should be made so by law.
In some respects the law about setting fires is strangely de
ficient. To set fire maliciously to a field of grain is by the law of
this State malicious mischief only. The penalties of arson do not'
apply to the offense. Standing grain in the field is insured, as
buildings are, but it is not adequately protected by criminal penal
ties, as buildings are. Insurance has never been extended to stand
ing timber. When burned it is a total loss/ To burn it inflicts dam
age far beyond the pocket of its owner, for*it means the decrease of
moisture in the soil, and injury to agriculture./ .
We do not know, how complete organization has been made
under the forest law passed by the last Legislature. In default
of any, the Water and Forests Society should get in touch with
the people and officials of the mountain counties and induce a
spirit of watchfulnes that will better protect the forest from fire.
It is nearly three months to rain. The intense heat has dried \ the
forest floor. The wet spring made abundance of- grass in the timber
which is now dried out to tinder. What is to be expected of camm
ing parties, and irresponsible boys , roaming around : in the moun

GOOD HUMOR AND HEALTH.
IF It were generally understood how
salutary the act of laughing is. to the
bodily health, says a physician in the
London Chronicle, there might be more
laughter, than .lamentation in the world,
and farcical ". comedies . -.pr ove more at
tractive to the Invalid j than ; physicians.
The old adage, "Laugh and grow, fat,"
is founded â¢ ;on a sound physiological
basis. . It is commonly observed that fat
men laugh with considerable facility.
But they do not laugh because they are
fat. They are fat because they laugh,
the act of cachinnation having a pro
found Influence in promoting appetite,
oxidation of the blood, digestionâin
deed, the entire and complex process of
nutrition. Good ' nourishment produces
the contented body, the fit temple of the
contented mind, 1 which v is, we know on
excellent authority, a perpetual feast. |
The immediate physical . results of in
dulgence in laughter are numerous. In
the first place the \ act of , laughing in
volves the exercise of a large number of
muscles, including many of those of the
face, neck, chest 'and : abdomen," which,
if they are exercised sufficiently, often
become correspondingly well developed,
as do also air those glands, blood ves
sels, nerves and other .'\u25a0 tissues in inti
mate connection with them. The facial
muscles, for example,' of the man who
laughs often and easily! are generally
developed to a degree which gives him
the facial rotundity of a contented child.
But laughter accomplishes , much more
than the production }of this more . out
ward appearance of well-being. : It has
a highly beneficial influence on those two
vital organs, the heart and the lungs: ;{
During what Is called a "fit" ; of laugh
ter the lungs may be almost completely
emptied of their contained 'air. y Fresh
air is then drawn in to the fullest extent
of their capacity, inflating, perhaps,
those little used air;, cells which con
tained â¢ previously ; only stagnant : air | and

ordinarily practice -comparatively large

Through this new ambition of the
American ; woman, therefore,, the . inter
national J marriage becomes a menace to
Europe.' ' It; is more to be feared "abroad,

| Contrast with this? view of-the-situa

They take " the ; ground that the noblesse
of Europe would become extinguished in

' The audience was as busy as the actors,
and a large and friendly one. The laugh
ter that punctuated the come"dy was of
the most strenuous sort, and the hissing
that pursued the villain like steam escap

Latierr.a's play is all in Yiddish, which
they tell me is equal quantities of "He

ttlllgible to the majority last night- Not
that one needed the tongue excessively,
Italian opera being a cuneiform inscrip
tion to the Yiddish drama. The story.
highly romantic, is Indeed quite intellig
ible to the amateur Yiddisher.
Mr. Latierna'e play is of modern make
as to date. It is old-fashioned as to cut,
with a villain that you can see a mile
off, long preachments from a moralizing
old doctor, a prince limp with love as
Orlando, and situations in accord. One

his love to the Herr Doktor for Gabriel's

sweetest," saysâ not the Prince, but his
familiar, the villain. He shall obtain
Dinah's love, the villain promises the

The next act shows the house of
Gabriel among the mountains. Dinah
is waiting for him! He comes shortly,
slightly tipsy from feasting in the
town. He tells Dinah of an offer he
has had from Hertzog (the villain) to
go away to paint pictures for the
Prince, who will pay him handsomely.
" Dinah fears the sudden good luck and
asks him to refuse the offer. He says
lie will, as Hertzog appears. Gabriel
says cheerfully that he Is as rich as he
wants to be and better a cottage in
the Alps with Dinah than a palace, etc.
Hertzog is foiled, but lures Gabriel
away by oth^r means. The Prince ap
pears, wooes and is repulsed. Gabriel

Read the famous little book, "Tho

tage. Miss Hopkins as the Russian
girl scored the best hit of her season
at the Central. True Boardman played
the leading role on short notice and
achieved a distinct success, much to
the surprise and pleasure of his many
friends. Henry Shuraer as the villain
was in fine fettle. Nicholls also had a
much better part than he has had for
some time and he did it full justice.
Pryse Mackaye contributed one of the
best bits of acting. The flume sceno
in the last act is very realistic.
Alcazar.
The last week of John Craig's en
gagement at the Alcazar began last
night in a clever and entertaining com
edy entitled "On Probation" and the
play was pre-eminently John Craig.
Around him several well played char
acters revolve and the Alcazar com
pany shows to excellent advantage. As
Jonathan Silsbee he was complete and
many expressions of regret were heard
that the popular actor Is making his
last appearance in San Francisco. \u25a0-.
Miss Lawrence has little to do in the
way of hard work and also finishes the
season. After a rest of several weeks
she will re-open with the reorganized
stock in the fall. The cleancut per
formance of Ruth Allen is worthy of
especial praise, being one of the best
things she has done this season. Harry
Yon Meter is easy and natural as Sir
Maurice, while HHliard looks and acts
the Prince. Scott does well as Pedro
while Maher is as usual very good.
Byers' make-up was much better than
his part. Elizabeth Woodson and Adele
Belgarde are good, while Linda Arvid
son is sweet and Ingenuous as Sadie.
Altogther the play is well worth seeing"
and enjoyable throughout.
California.
Florence Roberts renewed her former
triumph In "Tess of the d'Urbervilles"
at the California last night, having al
most entirely recovered. from her indis
position of the previous evening. Miss
Roberts gave full scope to her emo
tional talents in the part, though her
acting, owing to her illness, was rather
subdued in the tense scenes. She will: be
herself again this evening In a charac
ter which probably suits her more than
any other In her repertoire. The scene
where she kills her lover was thrilling
In the extreme, and she filled the exact
ing: requirements of the part with a
charm and ability all her own. Miss
Roberts was given effective support by
Lucius Henderson, who. as Angel Clare,
her husband, was good If somewhat
dilatory in coming back to his heart
broken wife. * Herschel Mayall was ex
cellent as Alee d'Urbervllle anÂ«l his
tipsy wenÂ« was well done. William
YearanCe did a fine piece of comic char
acter work as John Durbeyfield, and
Miss Ollle Cooper could not be improved
upon as Abraham, the twelve-year-old
boy. Miss Louise Royce was capital as
Joan Durbeyrteld. and Georgle Wood

NEW YORK, -July 10.â The full re
port on the Investigation of j the affairs
of the Equitable Life Assurance Society
was made public to-day by fthe State
Bureau of Insurance., It contains reve
lations:more startling than .those , ln the
earlier report of (Superintendent of In
surance Hendricks. - 1j
I Senator. CJiauncey M. Depew , testified
that the Dcpew Improvement Company,
in which lie wan Interested, obtained a
loan from the Equitable of $250,000 on
property which the 'State Insurance DÂ»
partnient valued at only $150,000. He
admitted that neither . the principal nor
the interest hnd bren putd and that the
Equitable had been forced to foreclose.
He admitted that while tut a member
of the executive \ committee of the
Equitable he had not ml vined this loan,
he had nevertheless I voted for it. -> He
confessed to making a promise that the
Equitable should be paid. the whole, but
in the same breath said that the prom
ise nai not binding.
Jacob H. Schift*,, confronted with ;the
records of the Equitable, showing that
Kuhn, Loeb had sold a large amount of
Union Pacific 'preferred stock to the so
ciety, swore that these' records > were
false. In various sales of bonds to the
Equitable .by his firm, he admitted that
a large loss was shown. He i confessed
that he had been a dummy director,' but
said that since the Equitable scandal
developed ,he had bought five ' shares .of
stock, paying $2000 a share.' M
fit appeared from his testimony and
that of Hyde and others that the Equit
able had taken ?2,000,000 worth/ of Union
Pacific preferred, apparently at the sug
gestion of E. H. Harriman. It appeared
that this stock was taken under a syn
dicate agreement that it; should not be
sold, making: the ; deal j a speculative one.
No record of this agreement 'was put in
evidence. Hyde said Harriman had it,
but Harriman was not called as a- wit
ness. : \u25a0 â¢ \u25a0 ' : ; - - : ";: ' \u25a0 '-â¢ ..-" \u25a0â¢ â¢>â¢' â¢\u25a0 â¢'\u25a0' -
j -'President-'Alexander'admitted that he
was in eight that sold se
curities to the Equitable. -In; only two
cases did he. ostensibly pay back | his
profits to the .society. These profits
amounted t0 '540,000.. -but. he -was, forced
to admit that* the Equitable had riot yet
got : the ? money, It ; being in the ;^hands
of the trustee. He admitted sanction
ing leases of Equitable' property, td
Hyde's \u25a0> safe deposit- - â¢- companies ,at:.a

society. \u25a0 ' :
James H. Hyde admitted -participation
In eight syndicates \ that sold securities
to the Equitable. He admitted that Pres
ident- Alexander was:- in- all of ."these
knowingly. He admitted that the $tjl,-

; William H. Mclntyre, a friend 'of
Hyde, testified to the profits made
but of the Equitable by the syndicates.
He said Hyde and Alexander J appor
tioned the share of the gains to the
participants. - In one deal alone he said
$95,000 was cleaned up. :.
â¢ . W. K. Creech, president ; of the Equit
able Trust Company," told how Hyde.iwho
controlled the' Equitable, had made large
profits out of the increase in capitaliza
tion: of the trust company .while the
Equitable, which : might have r, profited
largely, had really; sustained losses. :

S BULLET HOLB IX BREAST
James Kins Makes Coat raU let orr State
ment* as to How He Received
Wound, "Which Mar Prove Fatal.
r Jamos King, a native of Glasgow,
Scotland, was found in an apartment at
the Hunter House, Folsom and Third
streets, at 11 o'clock last night suffer
ing from a bullet wound In the region
of hla ! heart. Groaning was heard by
another roomer 'and an Investigation
resulted In finding King bleeding, but
.still conscious, on the floor of a cheap
room. -None of the inmates of the house
heard any shots fired, and King must
have been ' shot a short distance from
the lodging-house, as be could not have
walked far. -.
He claims that he was despondent
and sick and tried to commit suicide
with an old-style 22-callber revolver.
Being a stranger in the city he could
give no-number of the street on which
the shooting occurred. â¢ The police are
of the opinion that he attempted to hold
up some one and was shot, but this he
stoutly denies. His stories to th* offi
cers in the- ambulance were uncertain
and he contradicted himself In his
statements, ;it first saying that suicide
was the cause of the shooting, and later
that he was examining, the weapon
when it was suddenly discharged.
The bullet pierced his left lung, bare
ly missing his heart. It will probably
prove fatal. King is 22 year 9 of age.
He has been staying at the Hunter
House since last Wednesday. i

CORONER TRYING
TO FIX BLAME
Jury Selected and Visit Is
Made to Ruins of the
Building Which Collapsed
CAUSE IS UNEXPLAINED
Vigorous Effort to Be Made
to Discover Responsibility
for Death of Workman
A Coroner's Jury began investigation
yesterday of the collapsing of the Ninth
street building' in an endeavor to fix the
blame for the death of Samuel L. Cowap,
who was killed on Saturday when the
four-story structure suddenly came tum
bling down. During the afternoon the
Jurymen, Coroner Leland, City Building
Inspector John P. Horgan, City Architect
W. D. Shea and I. Harris from the Dis
trict Attorney's " office visited the scene.
The following constitute the Coroner's
Jury: L. A. Gunn, 1202 Market street; A.
Newman. 1065 Market street; J. F. Gib
son. 1202 Market street; J. W. Henderson.
1310 Market street; H. L. Young, 1346
Market street; Leon Lemos, 1127 Market
street; F. W. Hammann, 1458 Market
street, H. B. Behrend, 1165 Market street;
N. I* Hansen, 1207 Market street;,' W.-F.'
Harris, 52 Ninth street, J. Nevraumont,
117 Ninth street, and S. X. Kast, 78
Eighth street _ ;
More man an hour was spent trying to
determine the cause of tho collapse, but
nothing definite was learned. The Inquest
will go on this morning at 10 o'clock,
when the contractors, carpenters, , plumb
ers and others who worked on the build
ing will be called to give testimony.
An effort was made to ascertain if. the
contractors had disobeyed the city's
building laws. Inspector Horgan ; stated
that ha visited the building on June 30
and found that the proper material was
being used and the regulations adhered
to. He was Inclined to believe that the
collapse resulted from the removal of
bracings on the first floor. The Board of
Public Works will order the mass ..of
wood removed at once, and lt then can
be better determined whether tho bracing
was at fault. $
Several carpenters who had been work
ing on the building during the morning
aided the Jurymen In their search for, the
cause of the disaster. Hiram Peterson,
foreman of the carpenters, declared that
the bracings were not at fault, and that
the permanent bracing had been in - for
a week. He said he believed that the
collapse was caused by the settling of the
ground on which the foundation was laid,
and the sudden jar caused the building
to topole Into the street.

WHILE IT RAGES FIERCELY IN THE SEA OF JAPAN.
Steamship Arrives
From the Far
East.
Her Cargo Includes
Big Shipment
of Silk.
The Pacific Mall Company's liner Ko
rea, which arrived yesterday from the
Far East, on her outward voyage al
most gave her passengers a view of
the famous naval fight In the Sea of
Japan. As the Korea was leaving Moji
ehe was met by a Japanese navy tug.
whose commander Informed the Ko
rea's captain that the Japanese and
Russian fleets were fighting outside
end that if the Korea went out it must
be at her own risk. A sharp lookout
â¢was kept, but the straits were clear
aÂ« far as could be seen from the liner.
It was learned afterwards that the
Korea had passed within forty miles
of the scene *of the battle and some of
the passengers vowed they heard the
heavy cannonading, although the ship's
officers declare nothing could be heard.
The fog that helped the Japanese to
destroy the Russians interfered seri
ously with the navigation of the Ko
rea and tlie liner was detained outside
Shanghai for twenty-four hours on ac
count of thick weather. Otherwise the
voyage was pleasant and the Korea
reached this port on schedule time.
Captain Alex Swanson was the pilot
who boarded the Korea outside the
hea<!s and under his direction the liner
was berthed at the Pacific Mail wharf
quickly, quietly and neatly. Adrian
Zeeder, master of the British freighter
A.goa. is in temÂ£orary command of the
Korea during the absence on an ex
tended vacation of Captain Seabury
Captain Seabury will not return to
duty until after the liner's next return
from the Orient and Zeeder may retain
command until then, as none of the
passenger-liner captains In the com
pany 1 s service are available.
Rapidly as Swanson docked the
Ur.er he was not too speedy for Cap
tain Wilson, who was waiting on the
wharf with an army of stevedores, and
within five minutes of the time the
liner came to a etop at her berth bales
of ellk and bags of mail were sliding
in two avalanches from her side ports.
AÂ« bags and bales hit the wharf they
were hustled into waiting trucks and
before the last passenger had passed
down the transplank,Â«iail clerks were
Boning the letters and the silk was be
ing piled on board the special train
which was waiting to take It to New
lork at a mile-a-minute gait.'
The Korea brought 5400' ton's of car
go which included 30,000 chests of tea,
650 boxes of opium and 900 bales of
raw s,lk. She had on board mere
tlian 200 passengers.
Among the passengers were several
navy officers returning- from the Asi
nsn,>r*^- tiO ?- ISrael Putna m. a news

>'o Trachoma on Korea.
The liner Korea, which arrived yesterday
from the Orient, is the first passenger vessel
from the Far East for a long- time on which
not a single case of trachoma has "been dis
icovered. Dr. Trotter, the Marine. Hospital sur
geon, detailed for duty with the Immigra
tion bureau, has a keen eye for - blemished
eye-lids, but yesterday, after gazing into more
thaa 400 eyes, some of them worth gazing
into fcr their own sakes, most of them not, he
announced the discovery of only one pair of
optics of which the lids were not In good con
dition. And in that case he does not think
there is any trachoma, but he is holding the
case for further scrutiny. This absence of
trachoma, among the passengers is due. to the
cars and vigilance of Dr. H. C. . Dukes, the
liner' 6 6urgeon. who does tbÂ« weeding out \u25a0on
the other side. ,

(My Electrician Eefuses to

COST ESTDr ATES DIFFER
City Attorney to Solicit Of
fers for Sale; of Lots Ad
jacent to Telegraph Hill
. City Electrician Hewitt yesterday re
.fusecl, point "blank ,to comply 'with the
request of the Supervisors' Finance
Committee that, he furnish plans and
specifications to the Board of "Works for
the construction of conduits to , put the
city's wires underground on Mission street
from Second to Fifth. Hewitt claimed
that the charter placed. the power of In
stalling conduits with the Department of
Electricity alone.
\u25a0"By. direction of the Electricity Com
mission, I "must decline r to furnish any
plans for conduits to the Board of Works.
as it has absolutely nothing to do with
them," said .Hewitt. .
"We. do-. not care who does the work,"
said D'Ancona, "so long a3 the conduits
are riot, made, of gold." . ;.
Hewitt took exception to the remark,
saying, with j some heat, that his depart
ment had been subjected to too much un
just criticism and that -he was Lir.ed of
it; ' : '; " - ; â¢' .. \u25a0
Professor M. A. Cory, an expert em
ployed by the Finance Committee to rase
upon S the figures of cost submitted by
\u25a0Hawltt, said that he calculated that it
would cost $1240 to lay the conduits as
"against $1634 35 estimated by Hewnt; The
ilatter said - that Cory could not make a
correct off-hand estimate and that ht,
Hewitt, would not reduce his estimate. '
. .The committee decided to allow Hewitt
$1250 for the work at this time ani to
make up Â«iriy. additional sum, if it is
inecessary. -The committee alao requested
the City Attorney for an opinion as to
whether the Board of Works has ex
clusive control of, the laying. of conduits.
\u25a0 Hewitt . submitted demands; in sum
of $601 for salaries of mechanics em
ployed in June in, the Inside wiring of
Kngine 36. As the men employed aie
regular, employes of his department and
Hewitt wants to pay them out of V spe
cial appropriation of $804 50, the committee
declined to 'pass the demands.
The City Attorney was requested to*
solicit offers for: the sale to the city of
60-vara lot, No. 532. on the north side ot
Chestnut street, near Kearny, for the
preservation and Improvement of Tele
graph Hill, for which $23,000 was appro
priated.
The petition of the Board of Works that
$6125 be set aside to prepare the engineer
ing specifications for the paving of Lar
kin street, from Hayea to McAllister,
Stockton street from . Union to Green
wich, i Pacific street from . Stockton to
Kearny, Waverly place from Sacramento
to Clay. California Btreet from Mason to
Jones and the sewering of the Great
Highway from Fulton street to O street,
was referred to the Finance Committee.
The sum of $122,500 is. available ; ,for the
improvements 'under- 'the bond' lÂ»sus.Â« ." Jg
The petition of machine works and firms
that a competent elevator inspector be
appointed by the Board of.. Works was
referred to" the Finance Committee. The
petition states that the present inspector
was appointed at the instance of Morris
Levy and knows nothing about elevators.
The offer of De Ruyter. Krelgbaum &
Co to sell, at a price not stated, the
block bounded by Bay. Francisco. Taylor
and Jone* streets for Ia - children's play

VlewÂ« of Xcw York IlÂ»iuseÂ» on the
Current Situation.
Brokers' wires from New York yesterday
eild of cotton :
E. F. Hutton & Co. say: "There is a great
scandal growing out of the Government's re
ports and it makes it very hard to put any
faith la the latt report of the condition.
Would buy enly on good dips."
Price cays the report that he is to Issue
a. bearish cotton circular is without founda
tion. He believes that crop reports warrant
rcuch higher prices.
A. Viclett & Co. e*y: "I repeat my prÂ«
tfiction of Saturday that cotton will probably
ecU at 12c this week." 4 , \u25a0'
Lcgan & Bryen: "We beg to call your
attention to the weather throughout the cot
ton belt yesterday and to-day. Much damage
It being done to the crop. Cotton will sell
vÂ«.ry high on this crop."
Tl A. Maclntyre: "It Is our belief that
Jlc cotton Clscounts many things and marks
the extreme value of the crop on tha known
citu&tlon aafl outlook."

Xew York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. July 10.â The wiling to take
profits on the opening rise on stocks to-day
v.-as of a character to make a pause in the
operations fcr an advance and the marked
falling off in the volume in the dealings. Not
< t :v was the selling to realize of a sufficient
nature, but an influential element in the apecu-
Jation gave voice to rumors of an unfavorable
character. It was broadly asserted to-day
that icfonsatlon had been received that It had
t-t-en determined to maintain tha present divi
dend rat* on Union Pacific for the next period
Instead of Increasing it, and a section of the
rmhuElasts on that stock allowed it to be un
derstood that they were selling out their hold-
Ings and transferring their Interest to the por
tions of the industrial list. The iron and eteel
Industrial Amalgamated Copper and the Erics
turned to be the principal beneficiaries cf the
rKifting of speculative demands eaid to ba
poing on- The London markÂ«t was unsettled
h>- fears of trouble in the coming monthly set
tlement. Discounts hardened there under this
Influence and the coming offtrlng of the Jap
anese loan. Gold eleo rose In that roarkÂ«t on
the Paris demand which continued in epltÂ« of
UM announcement of the re-establishment of
an entente with Germany. Exchange her*
was inclined to eag and no more gold was
tnk^n for export. There was quite an active
demand , for time loans carrying over the- end
cf the yÂ«ar. . -
The opening cf subscriptions yesterday to
th-Â° Japanese loan apportionment and the rÂ«
turn of Government deposits set for Satur
day next were also 6ub3<!Cts for no little con-
Eid-eration- in the money market. It is ex
r*-cted that both these factors wtll operate in
thf first place to bring funds here from other
points to BÂ«t the requirements. Only about
4 pÂ«r cent of the Japanese subscriptions are
called for with applications, but it is evident
that the loan will be largely overapplled for
â¢with corresponding requirement for credits.
The commodities market is unsettled. The cot
tcn market scandal was made the text of Come
<?iBcusr!on of the adverse effect on capital out
lay of the successive developments of thÂ«
l&et few months showing the disregard and
violation <ot fiduciary obligations in various
relations to the general world of capital. The
rr.trket closed heavy at partial recoveries.
Bonds were irregular. . Total sales, par
\u25bcalue.. $3,260,000.

To-day's panicky market was partly- the re

fusion of ideas on the ; existing- conditions
arising from the sensational developments over
Sunday in connection with â¢ the announcement
of the result of the recent Investigation of thÂ«
chargee that the Government .crop reports
have lately been doctored. The crop situation,
is undoubtedly precarious, but there is nothing
to indicate an absolute crop failurdtoutside of
some scattered sections of Texas and in por
tions of Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana. .

ANGERED AT HIS MOTHER'S ORDER,
BOY AGED ELEVEN KILLS HIMSELF.
Ends His Life Because
Child : s Dead Body
Found Hanging
in Cellar.
Schoolmates Say
He Was Bright
Beyond Years.
A child little more than past the age
where some of the minor mysteries of
existence begin to unfold themselves
to the human mind took his own life
yesterday in a fit of anger. With the
care that might have been employed by
a morbid adult contemplating self-dc-
Btruction he planned his suicide and
his dead body was found in the cellar
hanging from a beam, the space that
had been occupied by a block of wood
he had kicked from under his feet after
mounting it 1 to make a droj> from' the
cellar gibbet, separating his dangling
le<?t from the floor.
Walter- St. Ciair, aged 11, and who
lived with his father and mother at
425 Seventh avenue, was the boy who
derided in his child :r.lnd that he had a
right to destroy that life the maker
had given liim. lie had been known as
a. boy of abnormal mentality, bright
at his books and delving into subjects
fur beyond others of his age. He also
had a temper easily aroused.
The little fellow haa been requested
by his mother. Mrs. F. F. St. Clair. to
chop some wood. He appeared cross
and ' sulky over the matter. To pla
cate him she promised him a . trip to
the Chutes In the afternoon, lie left
lier at 10 o'clock and, missing him an
hour later, she called and then
searched the house. She -found the
cellar door locked. She became
alarmed and called for help. The cel
lar door was broken open and Walter's
body v/as found suspended by a rope
from a rafter. It was later cut down
by Patrolman R. P. de Guire and taken
to the Morgue.
According to the statement of the
mother the boy was exceptionally
bright, standing at the head of his class
In the Richmond School. When she
missed him she searched the house,
thinking he. was hiding from her and
after finding the cellar door locked
looked in through a small window and
caw him apparently leaning . against
the wall. Realizing that â¢ something
was wrong she called for help and
Hugh Davis, who lives In. the house,
and William McDowell, a neighbor, re
sponded.
The two men broke in the door and

SyspepsiajDf Women
ABSOLUTELY NEEDLESS AGONY
Caused by Uterine Disorders and Curid by
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound
A gTeat many women suffer with a
form of indigestion or dyspepsia which
does not seem to yield to ordinary treat-
ment. Wkile the symptoms seem to be
similar to those of ordinary indiges-
tion, yet the medicines universally pre-
scribed do not seem to restore the pa-
tient's normal condition.
Mrs. Pinkham claims that there is a
kind of dyspepsia that is caused by a
derangement of the female organism,
and which, while it causes a disturb-
ance similar to ordinary indigestion,
cannot be relieved without a medicine
which not only acts as a stomach tonic,
but has peculiar uterine-tonic effects
also.
Aa proof of this theory we call at-
tention to the case of Mrs. Maggie
Wright, Brooklyn, N. V., who waa
completely cured by Lydia E. Pink-
hara's Vegetable Compound after every-
thing else had failed. She writes :
" For two yean I suffered with dyspepsia
which so degenerated my entir* system that I
was unable to attend to mv daily duties. I
felt weak and nervous, and'no thing that I ate
tasted rood and it caused a disturbenoe in my
stomach. I tried different dyspepsia cures,
but nothing soemed to help me. I waa ad-
vked to give Lrdia E. Pinkhaia's Vegetable
Compound a trial, and- was happily surprised
to find that it acted like a fine tonic, and in a
few days I began.to enjoy and properly digest
my food. Sly recovery was rapid," and in
five weeks I was a well woman. I have rec-
ommended it to many suffering women."
No other medicine in the world has
received such widespread and unquali-
fied endorsement,or has such a record of
cures of female troubles, as has Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.

discovered the suspended body. In or
der to kill himself the boy had secured
a block of wood, on which he stood
while adjusting the rope over theiraf
ter and around his neck. This block
he had kicked from beneath him. and
slowly strangled to death. ,
Harry St. Clalr, the father, learned
of his son's death on his return from
work. Several schoolmates of Walter
spoke of him as being exceptionally
bright, reading the newspapers and
literature on heavy subjects and win
ning honors In school. They added
that the child possessed a quick tem

his sister with an airgun in a fit of:

TALBOT WILL MAKE FLEA -

Qneatiom of Custody of Children of
Wealthy Lit leant Â» Is ' Still

Judge Murasky will determine this
morning: who is entitled' to the custody
of the minor children of Millionaire
William H. Talbot and his wife, Annie,
during the vacation period. Mrs. Tal

too. The father is anxious that they
go into the country for . a month; the
mother wants to keep them at home.
So the court must settle the dispute.
Talbot, leading- his two little sons,
Leroy and Willie, and accompanied by
Attorney Jordan, appeared in Judge
Murasky's court yesterday morning: for
the purpose of settling- at once the
question of the. disposition; of the chil

DISORDERLY
HOUSES MAY
BE CLOSED
Supreme Court Gives Police
Â§ Full Authority to v Enter
J Such Brothels as May Be
Open to General Public
DECISION IS VERY
LIBERAL IN SCOPE
Victory for Decent Element
of City Is Complete and
Judge Cook Gets Scoring
for Issuing Injunction
The Supreme Court has granted the Po
lice Department of San Francisco the
right to raid any. and all houses of prostl
tuion. into: 'which the ordinary citizen
may enter without Invitation or moles
tation. Ex-Chief of Police Wlttman is
sustaineds tamed in: his effort to suppress ; the
brothel at" 1129 Dupbnt street, and Supe
rior. Judge. Cook is scored" for issuing! an
injunction "preventing " interference with
the disgraceful business of the notorious
resort. In "accordance with the terms of
the decision, Chief of Police Dinan-may
direct his men to enter the premises at
1129 Dupon street. Bacon place, Belden
place. Hlnckley alley, 620 Jackson street
and any other of the disreputable dis
tricts.
The decision is broad in the extreme
and Is unanimous. Not only are the po
lice allowed to enter, these places and
arrest the inmates for any violation of
the law, but uniformed officers may pa
trol the interior, courts on which the
windows and " doors of the "cribs" front.
The Justices say unreservedly ' that any
reasonable means may be . taken to abate
the evil. The claim that the police
should be shut out, allowed by Judge
Cook, is styled preposterous by the Su
preme Court
BLOCKADE CAUSES SUIT.
The litigation commenced as a result
of the ordering of a police blockade on
1129 Dupont street ,by ex-Chief Wittman.
That the place was a brothel was ad
mitted by every one who knew anything
about the case. : .Even the men defend
ing the resort did not attempt to deny
anything that might be said against the
character of the female inmates. The
building is owned by P. Marslcano. It
was leased to P. Vincent, who sub-leased
it to George Sellinger.
Jean- Pon r placed a cigar stand and a
restaurant containing two tables and
eleven chairs inside the entrance to the
brothel. He claimed he had a lucrative
trade, and that the police blockade was
ruining his business. The court says his
business was unquestionably established
as a legal subterfuge ahd\whatever trjif!
flc he had resulted from" the existence "of
the house of crime adjoining. This fact,
alone, is held to have been ample. ground
Upon which to have sus taiped Judge Cook
in denying the petition for an injunction
against the police.
I George D. Collins, the overmarrled at
torney, who . is S numbered j with the miss
ing, was one "of <Â£he s lawyers who repre
sented : the brothel owners. ;
The court says that there can" be no
doubt that Pon did not come into court
with clean hands and a clear conscience.
Such places as 1129 Dupont street, it is
declared, should be suppressed.: The duty
is said to devolve on the police. The
claim that Pon's restaurant and cigar
stand were on a private passageway Is
ridiculed. It is declared to be . no one's
fault but his own if he chooses to lo
cate his business in a pla,ce of crime. The
police officers are given full '.authority to
stop all who may, attempt to enter the
brothel and question them/so far. as may
be necessary for the enforcement |of the
>aw and the securing; of for. a
-prosecution of the inmates of the place.
APPLICATION IS GENERAL,.
The Justices go farther than merely dis
solving the injunction' against the police
in respect to 1129 , Dupont street. It is
declared absolutely that the plea of main
taining a restaurant or other business in
a/house ot prostitution is of no avail. If
any citizen may enter by \u25a0 these so-called
.'.'private" passages, the way of ingress
and egress is held to be essentially pub
lic- . : . - ,-".-- :\u25a0;\u25a0'\u25a0 vi \u25a0;-.\u25a0?.\u25a0
There 'is practically no , limit to what
the police . may. do .in ; suppressing j the
brothels. Even - 620 Jackson street, the
"municipal" disorderly,' house, | cannot 'be
held exempt under: the decision," although
it was. specially constructed to evade the
law by -technicalities/
.District Attorney Byington has won a
hard : fight ln v this case. His prosecution
has been extremely vigorous. .The decent
elements of San â¢ Francisco rejoiced yes
terday, when the news of ruling was
spread : abroad. ' That ''. the entire : seven
Justices should dismiss^ the i technicalities

HUMAN JELLY FISH REEKS
WITH FRUIT EXTRACTS
PETER BRADY BATHES IN JAM
Peter Brady, the. human Jelly fish, had
been carefully scraped up In the City
Prison before he appeared in Judge Con
lan's, court yesterdays But upon Peter's
whiskers still lingered traces of currant
jelly, In his ragged locks- gleamed glo
bules .of quince jelly and on his cheeks
were daubs of blackberry jam.
Peter. had.'a great day Sunday. While
inspecting / the Southern Pacific freight
cars near Third andTownsend streets he
came upon ""a freighter branded with
California Jams and, jellies that were In
tended to introduce joy and appendicitis
into the effete East.
"This . for me," said Peter, "Here Is
where I. live." ;,'..'
He stove In the head of a ! bucket of
quinch Jelly and crammed the stuff down
his throat by the handful. When he
tired of this he opened the currant Jelly,
switched to strawberry Jam, sampled
some orange marmalade, helped himself
to blackberry Jam and topped it all off
with a tubful of apple sauce.
When Peter had finished his vegetarian
meal he seized a bucketful of currant
jam and- a pail of quince jelly. Carrying
these burdens he proceeded up Fourth
street, dripping with California fruit ex
tract. I He had only gone a few blocks
when Policeman Patrick Foley held him
up. : . '
"I've heard that they put most every
thing, lnto factory made jam," said Foley,
"but this is a new adulterant on me."
,:The jelly fish was scraped with a barrel
hoop and loaded into a patrol wagon. At
the City Prison they borrowed a curry
comb and went over him more carefully.
"I couldn't eat it all," said Brady to
Judge Conlan, "so. I took some of it lor
supper. My : appetite has gone back on
me lately." .
He brushed a few blackberry seeds out
of his eyes and sighed regretfully.
t'You admit taking the Jelly?" asked the
Judge. . ( . \u25a0', . \u25a0>'
* '\u25a0!â¢ took as much, of It as I could," re
plica Peter, "Inside and outside" and l in
my hands."
The jellyfish was found guilty of lar
ceny and , will be sentenced to-morrow to
a resort where Jam Is a novelty, and Jelly
is unknown. . :

General Manager Wells Has
Ordered Chief Engineer
Burns to Hasten the Work
It was formally announced by .the lo
cal officials of the Santa Fe Company
yesterday that steps are to be Immedi
ately taken toward the establishing of
big freight yards on the China Basin
property. As a result of the recent visit
to this. city *of Vice President Kendrlck.
instructions have been Issued by Gen-^
era! Manager Wells to Chief Engineer
.Burns to hurry to completion plans for
the construction of two immense freight
houses In that locality. They will be
1200 feet long and will be the neucleus
for what promises to be one of the larg
est freight terminals In the West. It Is
expected that the construction of these
buildings will take about a year, during
which time other Important improvements
will be under way at the basin.
The' officials of the Santa Fe keenly ap
preciate . the* fact that the railroad busi
ness in California, and especially In San
Francisco, is rapidly growing to enormous
Importance, and it is In' anticipation of
the demand for greater facilities for
handling freight that it has been decided
to thoroughly equip the China B>Â»in
property. While this work Is In progress,
the company will be finishing the cut-off
on Its main line near Albuquerque and
double-tracking the greater portion of Its
road east of that, town to Chicago. Dis
cussing the projected Improvements in
this city, one of th* officials of the road
said yesterday:
That San Francisco 1Â» to b* a rr**t trÂ«irat
center Is â¢no longer a theory, but * certainty.
Competitive points along: tha coast will not
materially Interfere with this city's growth la
this respect. Tha Santa Fe Company is now
preparing to meet this development at a pres
ent cost of 910.000,000.
The establishment of sheds at China
Basin will be the first move by the com
pany toward concentrating its freight
business at that point, where, with the
building of necessary wharves, it will ba
to receive freight from the larg-
est ships afloat and from all points In
this country over Its own rails.
