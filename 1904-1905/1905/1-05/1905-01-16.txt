FRENCH PREMIER COMBES RETIRES
AFTER A FINAL TRIUMPH.
Loubet Will Receive Cabinets Resignation on Wednesday
PARIS, Jan. 1 J.âCombes has retired from the Premiership with his face to the foe and in all prob
ability Rouvier will head the next French Ministry. The resignations of all members of the Cabinet
have been drawn up and will be presented to President Loubet on Wednesday. By retiring just
after he had won a final triumph over the opposition in the Chamber ot Deputies, Combes is left in
a position where he will have a voice in the selection of the new Cabinet and will wield a powerful
influence in shaping the future policy of the Government. His successor is expected to adhere
closely to his programme.
PARIS, Jan. 15.âThe ministr-- of
Combes, after emerging successfully
from its bitter midnight struggle in I
the Chamber of Deputies, has decided :
to abandon the field while some portion j
of its prestige still remains, and has
signified its intention of resigning. The
resignations will be presented on Wed
nesday mornng.
Friends of the Ministry maintain
that its retirement is voluntary, as
Combes has succeeded in resisting the
effort to compel his fall. The opposi
tion, however, hails the decision as a
victory, claiming that the small ma
jority for the Ministry last night left
Combes shorn of effective strength to
carry out his policies.
Combes called at the Elysee Palace
to-day to confer with President Loubet,
but the latter was overwhelmed by the
fatal illness of his mother, who died
to-day. The President's affliction pre
vented any discussion of the Cabinet
situation.
PREMIER LOOKS CAREWORN.
Premier Combes received the various
Ministers, during the day. He looked
careworn after ten hours of parliamen
tary battle, in which he occupied the
floor for three hours and was the center
of a continuous attack during the re
maining hours. He spoke freely of the
Intention of his Cabinet to retire as a
whole and outlined the details of its
closing work. He regards the retire
ment as wholly voluntary, as the votes
last night, although showing small ma
jorities, gave enough margin to permit
of the carrying on of the ministerial
programme. However, he considers
that his departure will facilitate the
realization of the programme, instead
of interrupting it, since his successor
will be able to unite the discordant
elements which have become personally
hostile to him.
It is considered that Combes' volun
tary withdrawal will permit him to ex
ercise a powerful and probably a de
cisive influence in the choice of his
successor, similar to that which Wal
deck-Rousseau exercised when volun
tarily relinquishing power.
To-night it was said that Rouvier ap
peared to have been practically dp- |
elded upon as the future chief of the |i
Ministry and that he had asked Del
casse and Berleaux to retain the For- \
eign and War portfolios, respectively.
The logic of the stiuation appears
to point to Rouvier. He is accept
able both to Combes and to those who
arc rebelling against his authority.
However, if Combes exercise the au
thority to name his own successor h<
may designate Brisson, who as Presi
dent of the Chamber of Deputies as
sisted in the execution of the Combes
programme. The names of MUlerand,
Poincere, Doumer and Clemenceau are
prominently mentioned, their strength
depending upon later combinations in
the majority groups. However, the per
sonal influence the President usually
exercised is obscured by death within
his household, making the outcome of
the reorganization of the Ministry in
creasingly doubtful.
NO CHANGE IN POLICY.
The effect of the change uoon the
Government's policies is not considered
to be great. The new Ministry will have
the same majority as that supporting
Combes. This majority has repeatedly
upheld Premier Combes' project tend-

NEW YORK. Jan. 15.âReferring to
John D. Rockefeller as "Mr. Oilerfeller,"
Rev. Thomas J. Ducey, pastor of St.
Leo's Catholic Church, to-day preach
ed against trusts and monopolies in
general and the Standard Oil Com
pany in particular.
"In this country," said Father Du
cey, "e"xists a monopoly and trust that
threatens the safety of the Govern
ment, truth, justice, freedom of edu
cation and the purity of soul in re
ligious profession.
"This paramount trust of the world
is well preserved In oil and gold and is
glossed over by univeisities and up
held openly by one denomination and
criminally approved by the silence
which grants the consent of the minis
ters of religion from many othef de
nominations.
"Every man standing between the
head of this monopoly and his gold
was to be bribed or ruined; every com
bination opposed to him meant more
attacks, more plotting, without fear or
favor, to drive it from the field.
"From the time that Mr. Oilerfeller
began crowding the weaker and more
honorable remorselessly to the wall by
means of improvement companies,
which meant to destroy opponents and
improve himself, but one purpose
marked his business conduct. *
"It would be well for those who are
in the habit of quoting the Bible in

quote scripture for his purpose and
can steal the livery of heaven to do
the work of sin, crime and injustice."

CONFESSES
TO POLICE
Admits Attempt to
Blow Up Liner
UmMa.
Explosion at Statue of Fred
erick the Great Also
His Work.
Philadelphia Prisoner Is Classed as
''an American Fatriotic
'FanLtic"
PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 15. â"Gess-
ler Rosseau," who was arrested in this
city on Thursday with an unloaded in
fernal machine in his possession, ad
mitted to the police to-day that he is
the man who attempted to destroy the
statue of Frederick the Great In
Washington last Tuesday, and also
that it was he who sent the trunk con
taining an infernal machine to the
British steamship Umbria in New
York in May, 1903. The prisoner,
whose right name is not known, made
these admissions In the office of Cap
tain Donaghy of the Philadelphia de
tective force, after he had been iden
tified by persons brought here from
New York and Washington for that
purpose. He gives no reasons for the
attempted outrages, except that "there
are too many foreign affairs in this
country." Aft3r having Rosseau un
der tire all afternoon, the police
classed him as "an American patriotic
fanatic."
The prisoner gave no information
voluntarily to the police, he admitting
only those things which the police had
fastened upon him. Both the Wash
ington and New York authorities want
the man and it is probable that he
will be turned over to the police of
the latter city.
HOW ROSSEAU WAS CAUGHT.
The upprehension of Rosseau was
due to the disappearance of Owen
Kelly, a wealthy Irish-American, who
is prominent in Irish-American socie
ties in this country. Keliy disappeared
on October 25 and from time to time
the newspapers, particularly of the
East, published articles on the
mysterious disappearance. These, the
police believe, undoubtedly attracted
Rosseau's attention. On Thursday he
called on Patrick Kelly, the brother of
the missing man, and offered to take
him to his brother in New York for
$500. He said he and Owen Kelly be
longed to secret societies that were
organized for the purpose of blowing
up British ships in American ports.
The valise he carried, he said, con
tained explosives.
Patrick Kelly notified the police and
Rosseau was taken Into custody. The
valise contained an infernal machine
of the clock-arrangement variety, but
no explosives. About the machine was
wrapped a Washington newspaper.
This gave the police the clew that he
might" know something of the ex
plosion at the statue of Frederick the
Great and his picture was taken and
sent to both the Washington and the
New York authorities. In the mean
time he also was suspected of know
ing something of the steamship Um
bria incident.
To-day Captain Robert Boardman
of the Washington detective force and
Alfred Carter, colored, and George H.
Hazel, cabmeiv of Washington, who
saw the man who attempted to blow
up the statue, and Detective Sergeant
Arthur Carey of New York and a Mrs.
Curry, who keeps a bÂ°arding-house in
the latter city, arrived here for the
purpose of identifying the prisoner.
PRISONER IS IDENTIFIED.
When Rosseau was brought Into the
office of Captain Donaghy, Hazel said:
"1 guess you know me," to which the
prisoner replied, "How do you do?"
Rosseau bowed to Carter and then
greeted Mrs. Curry. Having satisfied
themselves beyond doubt that the
identification was complete, the police
officials of the three cities set at work
to obtaining a confession from the
prisoner.
In reply to a question he admitted
the attempted outrage on the statue.
He said he had manufactured the in
fernal machine himself and that it
consisted of a candle, fuse and "dyna
mite engine." Where he made it he
would not say. The failure to destroy
the statue, he said, must have been
due to the melting tallow spoiling the
fuse or interfering with the dynamite.
Rosseau then gave the police the in
teresting Information that he had in
tended marking a second attempt to
blow up the statue, this time with a
time-clock machine. As it was diffi
cult to get past the sentries after
nightfall, he intended going to the
arsenal at about dusk to arrange the
infernal machine so that it would ex
plode about midnight and then hang
it on the statue.
ATTEMPT TO BLOW 7 UP LINER.
Regarding the sending of the in
fernal machine to the steamship Um
bria, Rosseau said that he made part
of the Umbria Infernal machine in
Chicago and then took it to New York
in a trunk. He admitted having writ
ten the note to Police Commissioner
Greene, as follows:
"The Mafia greets you and wishes
you well. The society has declared
war against England and, has ordered
the destruction of every steamer fly
ing the British flag that sails out of
New York. The society has under
taken to clear New York harbor of
British ships, and it will succeed."
It was this note of warning that led
to the finding of the trunk before It
was placed on the steamship.
The prisoner was closely questioned
regarding the motive for blowing up
the Umbria, but was noncommittal.
He said that he was born in America
and that he was a farmer. He said he
EDUCATION

Stanley Hall Says

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BALTIMORE, Jan. 15.â"Any educa
tion that develops progressive sterility
or race suicide is a failure. At present
our higher education would soon depop
ulate the country if it became univer
sal. If there is any truth in the old
saw of Huxley that an ounce of hered
ity is worth a. ton of education, it fol
lows that if our academic culture
makes the supreme joy of parenthood
less ardently craved it is already bio
logically bankrupt.
"Thus,, as this evil is worse with
women, and as man unaided by her
can. never hope to solve the problem of
her sex, the argument for the very
higher education of the few best
women is that thus, somehow or some
wheae one may arise who will find out
a new and better way."
This statement was made by Presi
dent Stanley Hall of Clark University
in his address before the American As
sociation of Universities. "Co-Instruc
tion" was the topic of the session. In
his paper President Hall said:
"Perhaps the gravest danger is that
twenty years after graduation about
one-half of the college girls of three
women's colleges and one-quarter of
the graduates of nine Eastern colleges
for men are unmarried. Few marry
later than twenty years after gradua
tion and those who do marry have only
two children per marriage, or less than
3 per cent. If civilization is man's self
domestication and higher education is
its acme, why should not the test of
fertility also apply to It as well as to
domestication: and if our acadamic
youth and maidens -are God-chosen
ones, why should not the Abrahamic
promise apply to them if they keep
covenant with their own nature?
"Are we not losing our labor if the
educational classes are plowed under,
as at present, and culture is not trans
mitted into the most ancient form of
wealth and worthâheredity?"

Special Dispatch to Ttaa Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 15. âAn attempt
will be made soon to dissipate fog in
New York harbor by shooting a 250,
--000 volt electric bolt through barbed
wire into the air. This is the method
which Sir Oliver Lodge has adopted
in his wonderfully successful fog dis
pelling experiments at Birmingham
University, England.
The experiments here probably will
be conducted off the Quarantine sta
tion on Staten Island, or at Governor's
Island, at both of which high masts
or poles will be available.
The fogs in New York harbor have
been unsually dense and prolonged
this winter.
Sir Oliver asserts that he can dis
sipate smoke, fog and mist. Inci
dentally, he produces rain. This he
accomplishes by the production of
continuous high potential electrical
discharges. He has effected a com
bination of high potential rectifiers.

Incomplete Search Reveals

Said to Have Eeen Smuggled Over
and fhen Given as Presents

CLEVELAND, Jan. 15.âThe Plain
Dealer to-morrow will say: Investiga
tion into the charges that Mrs. Cassie
L. Chadwick smuggled large quantities
of diamonds, gems and other precious
stones into this country has developed
the fact that the woman dealt in pre
ciouÃ stones to an almost fabulous ex
tent. In order to make a case on the
charge of* smuggling it was found
necessary for the Government authori
ties to trace ail the deals for diamonds
and jewelry made by M*%. Chadwick,
both in this country and in Europe.
The statement has been made by Col
lector of Customs Leach that jewelry
and precious stones worth more than
$250,000 and handled by Mrs. Chadwick
have been traced and positively located.
It is added that this great amount of
jewelry has been uncovered with the
investigation still incomplete. Of this
amount the Government is directly in
terested in about one-third.
While the Government is attempting
simply to collect any unpaid duties on
diamonds brought from Europe, it is
understood that all the evidence se
cured will be placed at the disposal of
Receiver Nathan Loesser and that he
will be able to realize thousands of dol
lars for the creditors of the woman.
The investigation has led to the dis
covery that only a small portion of the
jewelry was put up as collateral for
loans made by Mrs.jChadwick 'and that
by far the greater portion went as gifts
to friends and acquaintances.
The regular customs rate of duty on
diamonds and Jewelry brought to this
country is 10 per cent of the value of
the goods. Figuring on this basis, the
Government authorities expect to real
ize between $8000 and $10,000. The rest
of the proceeds from the sale of any
jewelry on which duty has not been
paid will be turned over to Loesser to
be distributed among the Chadwick
creditors.
"It is simply the truth to say that
Mrs. Chadwick handled pearls, rubies,
sapphires, emeralds and garnets almost
literally by the peck," said a Govern
ment official. "The testimony of experts
shows that the woman did not handle
anything but the finest articles, and
there is scarcely a penny's worth of
cheap jewelry in the entire lot that has
been traced."
According to Government officials by
far the greater portion of the jewelry
is in the hands of innocent persons.
The work of informing these people
that their claim on the jewelry is to be
protested is going on.
It is believed that practically alj the
people who have the jewelry will agree
to a settlement without taking the mat
ter into the courts. At the same timÂ«
the Government authorities, as well as
Receiver Loesser, are taking steps to
enforce their demands matter if
so compelled.
SUFFERS RATHER
THAN ASK HELP
Scion of a Famous French
Family Lives in Want With
Plenty of Means at His Call
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 15.âComte
Vaillant de la Croix, the last male
survivor of one of the noblest families
of France, is dying penniless in Los
Angeles because he is too proud to let
his wealthy relatives in Paris know
aught of his sickness and poverty.
Since the days of the crusades the
house of De la Croix has been one of
prominence among French aristocracy.
The father of the present Count was
killed in the Franco-Prussian war.
Count "Vaillant chose music as his pro
fession and practically renounced his
title when he came to America about
fifteen years ago in pursuance of his
musical career. He was educated un
der the best masters of Paris and
Florence and under the stage name of
Signor Bravura he gained renown as
a leading barytone in Europe and
America.
In the East the Count achieved
some success as a manager of opera
companies. He was at various times
instructor in voice culture in the Bos
ton Conservatory of Music, the Knick
erbocker Conservatory of New York,
the Illinois Conservatory of Music and
other institutions. Several years ago
he came to the Pacific Coast for the
benefit of his health and opened a
studio in San Francisco. Mrs. Percy
Cartwright and Miss Jessie Baker of
Oakland were trained by him for
grand opeÂ»a. #
About a year ago he came to Los
Angeles, where he had a large class
of pupils. His health broke down four
months ago. His resources gave out
and he would now be in the County
Hospital but for the charity of
strangers. De la Croix has a wealthy
sister in Paris, but his pride will not
permit him to apply to her for â¢nist
> ance.

General Trepoff, who recently was
relieved of the office of Chief of Police
of Moscow and ordered to the front to
â¢take up his duties as head of the Red
Cross Society in Manchuria, incurred
the special enmity of the students of
Moscow by the severity with which he
put down their demonstrations of
December 18 and 19, 1904. Within
one week, in 1902, there were three
.attempts on his life. The first of these,
on March 31, was by a woman named
Allart. a governess, wno placed the
muzzle of a pistol against General
â¢TrapofTs breast and pulled the trigger,
the weapon, however, failing to dis

supposed to be a rusticated student,
sprang upon the step of the vehicle and
tried to stab him, but only succeeded
in slightly wounding a policeman.

programme relating to separation will
be carried out, although Combes' re

The issue which proved most decisive
in hastening the resignation of the
Ministers was the popular outcry
against secret reports on the lives of
army officers. The change will undoubt

The enactment of an income tax and

vice of real and hlch importance to the whole
nation in your management of the office under
you. When I asked you to take the position
I realized that I was askings, you to do what
meant genuine self-sacrifice oh your part; and
I roaltze that your consenting to stay in so
lons has meant further loss to you. But
surely you mvist fed recompensed by the
k-> wledge of the value of your work. You
have set a standard of unceasing industry, of
untiring energy, of high administrate ability
and of single-minded devotion to duty, which
your successor will find it difficult to equal,
no matter how good a man he may be.
CLING TO THE FINERY
OF PALEFACE FRIENDS
Indians Marry According to Tribal
Custom, but Wear Wedding Gar
ments After Fashion of Whites.
RENO, Jan. 15. âAn educated young
couple of the Shoshone tribe, intent
upon following somewhat in the steps
of the white man, but disliking the
thought of entirely abandoning the
customs of their people, were married
in the presence of their people at Aus
tin yesterday. Indians from surround
ing camps were in attendance.
The ceremony was performed by
Chief Tom Toi Toi. The couple were
attired in the customary wedding garb
of their paleface friends. A wedding
supper was also served.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 16, 1905.
ATTACHES OF THE LEGISLATURE FULL
OF WOE BECAUSE WORK IS IN SIGHT
Economists Tafe Steps to (ompef Appointees to Attend
Early Morning Roll
Call Planned by
Reformers.
Special Dljrnatrh to The CSC
SACRAMENTO, , Jan, 15.âConsider
able excitement was manifested to- ]
night among the legislators when it
was announced that some day this ,
week, probably to-morrow, the minor- 1
ity in both Houses would demand a ;
roll call of attaches. The minority in '.
this instance is that division of each
House opposed to the patronage meas
ures as passed, and which held that '
for economy's sake the legislators
should reduce the patronage to the !
minimum, Bay of $10 for the Senate and
$6 for the Assembly. They lost their
fight and now they are determined that j
no matter how many were appointea
they must report lor duty and be at ;
least wining to labor should the neces
sity arise. :
The claim is broadly made that at
past sessions about one-hait ot the 1
attaches of both Houses did no other j
labor than to take the oath of office. 1
hypothecate their warrants and start i
for home to take up their usual occu- j
pations. Though there has been no evi
dence to date that this scheme will be i
repeated the minority says it will take
Steps to see that it is not. It will sec j
that every attache reports to the ser- |
geant-at-arms at the usual hour, and
tailing to do so will be reported to the
Chairman of the committee on attaches j
for removal.
The small excitement of to-nitrht is
due to the fact that many of the legis
lators do not know whether their favor
ite appointes are in town and fear that
should the roll call be demanded be
fore the word is well circulated it will
disclose an absence of employes of both
Houses that will discomfit even the
most rabid advocate of generous pat
ronage.
Quite a number of legislators and
lobbyists arrived from the bay cities on
the late trains to-night. Jere Burke
of the Southern Pacific was the most
prominent among the latter, and
though he confessed that there were
no more Senators to be elected, it was
said there was other work to do that
would require his presence here for a
few days.
The returning legislators experienced
conflicting emotions regarding the
minority scheme to demand a roll call
of all attaches, and the older heads,
though saying they had no obiection
to such a course, pointed out that be
fore the minority could carry through
its plan, which might possibly Â©m
bassass the majority, it would first have
to consult the majority and if the ma
jority should fail to see, things in the
light of the minority its storming
would avail it little.
Flint to Attend Banquet.
SAN DIEGO, Jan. 15.âSenator
elect Frank P. Flint of Los Angeles

San Chamber of Commerce to

quet on the evening of January 23.
SAYS RATE SUPERVISION
WILL AFFECT EMPLOYES
President Tuttle of Boston and Maine
Koad Talks of Roose
velt's Policy.
BOSTON, Jan. 15.â1n an address be
fore the Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers, Division 61, on the occasion
of )ts fortieth anniversary to-day, Pres
ident Lucius Tuttle of the Boston &
Maine Railroad, spoke of President
Roosevelt's proposal that railroad rates
be regulated under Congressional su
pervision and authority.
Tuttle declared that such a policy, if
carried out, must inevitably affect the
income of the 1,000,000 persons who de
rive their income directly from the
railroads. He did not think it had been
or could be shown that the makers of
the constitution ever had anjaÂ» other
thought in mind in connection with the
delegation to Congress of the power to
regulate interstate commerce relations
than a well-defined intent to forever
prevent the erection by any State of
any customs, tariffs or other barriers
that should be an obstruction to the
free currents of commerce.
"The railroads in 1903," he said,
"were able only to pay their share
holders an average dividend of less
than 3 per cent and any further general
reduction of rates must necessarily be
followed by a reduction of operating
expenses.'" â¢

frp*clal Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 15âA bill is ]
being framed here for the increase of !
the State's revenue by licensing corpor- j
ati.ms. It is said to have the favor of j
the administration and will probably
be introduced by Senator Hahn at an |
cuny date. i
The proposed measure will impose an 1
annual license fee of $10 on every cor- (
poration in the state. It will provide |
that all who do not pay this license
Shal] forfeit their franchises. As there
are about 40,000 corporations in Cali- >
fornia, the revenue obtained will be
i:. the neighborhood or $.500,000.
Many wildcat corporations that
never got further than naming direc- |
tors and issuing worthless stock would
be wiped on* the map by the bill. Mar- f

WILL SEEK REVENGE.
Movement on Foot to Spoil Prescott's
Chance for Office.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 15. âA move
ment has been started in San Bernar
dino by prominent citizens of the
county to bring to the personal notice
of President Roosevelt the alleged lack
of honor which Speaker F. C. Prescott
displayed in ignoring the wishes of his
constituents in the matter of electing
a United States Senator. It is their
plan to send to the President a copy
of the resolutions of the county con
vention in which they declared for
Bard, and also copies of Prescott's
speeches before election in which he
stated that "It is not what Prescott
wants, but what you want."'
Prescott is looking for a Federal ap
pointment, so think the people, and it
is apparently their desire that he shall
be well known at Washington.

"We Want a Farm,
Not Buildings,"
Say Ranchers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 15.âMembers of
the Legislature who represent farming
communities insist that the State shall
do something at once to promote the
agricultural interests of California. Re
marks of this tenor are made:
"The proposition to spend $200,000 for
an agricultural building at Berkeley
and 50 cents for a farm is not accept
able. We want a farm of 800 or 900
acres, and it should not be in the im
mediate vicinity of Berkeley."
There will surely be an interesting
contest when the several bills bearing
on the proposed appropriation come be
fore the Legislature. Men who are fore
most in advocating what they term the
development of practical agricultureâ
the kind of development that will add
to the wealth of the State by inviting
young men to follow the pursuit of
farming for profit to themselves âcon-
tend that something more than theo
retical instruction is demanded. .The
splendid results achieved in Wisconsin,
lowa and Minnesota by object lessons
in the cultivation of the soil, the breed
ing of livestock and the management of
dairies are cited by the advocates of a
farm.
One of the chief advocates of an ap
propriation of $200,000 for a farm says:
"In the first place, we want a farm,
and later on an appropriation may be
made for a building. The professors at
Berkeley who are familiar with the
subject understand that a farm of
some magnitude is required. Our plan
is that the Governor, Lieutenant Gov
ernor, Chief Justice of / the Supreme
Court, the president of the university
and the president of the State Agricul
tural Society shall locate the farm.
When the location is made efforts to
enroll students will begin. The land will
be cultivated. For example, in corn
planting rows of several varieties will
be planted one month, a month later
and still a month later other rows will
be planted. Careful data of the growth,
the treatment and the production will
be made. In this manner the product
in lowa was increased 100,000,000 bush
els.
"Our* wheat, through lack of prac
tical knowledge on the part of our
farmers, is not producing, so It is ar
gued, the flour of the high standard at
tained years ago. The best flour of the
world should be produced here, as the
conditions of soil and climate are un
surpassed, but intelligent methods of
treatment and cultivation of the land
must be taught by practical demon
stration.
"The output of our dairy farms
should be increased. Practical lessons
in feeding should be given. Proper mix
ture of food would double the product
of butter without increasing the cost of
feeding.
"Above all, something must be done
to allure young men to the farm by
making the industry remunerative. Ap
plication of proper methods of cultiva
tion will engage the intellect .of the
farmer and banish the drudgery of or
dinary farm life."

TREATY URGED
WITH GERMANY
Reciprocity Pact Desired
by the American Chamber
of Commerce in Berlin
LETTER TO ROOSEVELT
Believed That the Time Is
Now Ripe for Opening of
Negotiations on Subject
BERLIN, Jan. IB.âThe American
Chamber of Commerce of Berlin con
siders that the moment is favorable for
a movement, looking toward a reciproc
ity treaty between the United States
and GermJany, and especially so be
cause the new system of reciprocity
treaties which Germany has concluded
will probably affect American trade
adversely. The Chamber of Commerce
on December 23 sent a petition to Pres
ident Roosevelt, which in part follows:
The American Chamber of Commerce of Ber
lin, organized with the purpose of furthering
good relations between the United States and
Germany, especially In the direction of com
mercial affairs, and including among its mem
bers leading concerns of both nationalities
trading between the two countries, would pray
that you uree upon Congress and the other
authorities the presdag need of prompt action
for a recirjroclty treaty With Germany and
also of new laws and regulations for the ap
praisal of merchandise to replace the present
very faulty and often unjust system which has"
been and still is constantly causing much bit
terness of feeling among practically all the
importers of commodities into ports of the
United States.

information.

Weekly Gall $1.00 wMSOLDIER MURPHY RETURNS
FROM CANNIBAL LAND.
Says Wild Ifugao Tribes Treated Him Well
To have been the only white man who
has ever managed to exist without hav
ing his ribs picked clean among a tribe
of the fiercest cannibals of the island of
â¢Luzon, Philippines; to have been greet
ed as a friend by the savages' "big
chief," and to have succeeded in spend
. iv.g two years with as strange a people
as Uncle Sam has ever taken under the
protecting folds' of the Stars and Stripes
is the experience of L. M. Murphy, sol
â¢ eier of war and of fortune.
Mr. Murphy arrived from Manila on
â¢the transport Sherman yesterday after
noon, and it is an odd contradiction of
human fancy, as the civilized world un
derstands it, that he should be some
what sorry that he is come. Murphy
among cannibals is really happier than
Murphy in America. The traveler from
the jungle is a convert to "The Simple
Life," and he eschews only the spare
ribs of the human toastâthe victim of
a head hunt. Savagery is not so bad as
ft is painted, he says, and Murphy of
Bantoc has waxed fat and happy under
Its fanatical Influences.
"Northwestern and Northeastern Lu
â en," says Murphy, "is a no-man's
land, in which the mysteries of civiliza
tion have never even had opportunity
to present a problem." Abra, Ifugao
and La Ponta, deep in the frowning
ridges of a rugged mountain range,
teem with a human life that is as prim
itive as that which peopled the Sand
wich group when Cook found them.
The Spanish never dared to venture!
farther inland than Bantoc, seventy
miles from the country of the head
hunters, yet this one man, without arms
and with nothing but a small supply of
' provisions and a camera outfit, went
among the natives and was welcomed
by them.
"1 was a private in Com.pany C, Six
teenth said Murphy. "I got
my discharge aoput three years ago,
after serving three years in active ser
vice with my regiment. Being a pho
tographer of the amateur kind, I con
ceived the idea that it would be a good
business proposition if I could Succeed
â¢ in making a trip into the Ifugoa coun
. try and get the true story of that queer,
isolated people.
"When I started from Bantoc, the
nearest point to the rough Ifugoa
.lands. I was well provided with arms
and ammunition, but I had some diffi-,
culty with the constabulary, who seized
my pistols. The Spanish ex-officials at
Bantoc warned me not to make the
trip, as there had never been any ef
fort made by white men to enter the
domain of the cannibals. The province
is cut off from the main part of the
island, and as the people only bothered
the Filipinos living at theÂ«edge of their
territory the Spanish Government
thought it not worth while to send
troops into the mountainous district'to
"subjugate the tribe.
STARTS ON JOURNEY.
"I started on my journey, traveling
â¢from town to town with a few native
companions. Soon 1 found myself in a
wild region threaded by narrow forest
paths that led up and down steep
ridges. The tropic foliage entwined
about the thick growth of trees and
made it difficult to travel. After sev
eral weeks of hardship I reached the
home of the Ifugao and was told that
an old chief had a village near at hand,
but probably would not receive me
with much good grace. One afternoon
I wandered into the woods, and, hear
ing a noise in the brush, looked up and
saw a savage face glaring at me
through the jungle at a distance of not
â¢ more than ten yards.
"For several seconds we stood gazing
intently at each other. Then the old
thief broke the silence by repeating
'Amigo' (friend).
" 'Amigo,' " I replied.
" 'Marcano?'" he asked, mispro
nouncing 'Americano,' Spanish for
â¢ 'American.'
"I knew a few words of the Ifugao
dialect and tried to tell him that my
â¢ mission was a friendly one. He turned
' toward the forest and shouted some
â¢ thing and in a jiffy a band of savages
*vere gathered about me. I was given
â¢a sign to accompany them.
"I found the Ifugao tribe to be con
firmed head-hunters and cannibals.
â¢The .only distinction between a good
and a bad roast of human flesh was
â  whether it was that of a Filipino or a
â  member of a neighboring tribe. The
â¢Ifugao never eats one of his own race,
â  but he will travel a long distance, over
what seems to be an impassable coun
try to get a Filipino head. I never
witnessed cannibal feats, but was
shown ample evidence of them after
their termination.
"Physically the Ifugao and other
tribes of the provinces I visited are
splendid specimens of mankind, al
though they are of small stature.
Strange to say, In spite of their canni
balistic tendencies they are the great
est producers of vegetable supplies on
the island of Luzon. They are great
farmers and transport their green
stuff for many miles over the nar
row, treacherous roads of the seventy
miles between them and Bantoc. They
grow cabbages and radishes on their

lands, and from rice make a very su- j
perior quality of bread. They have |
developed a peculiar sort of vegetable '
that looks like slippery elm and if a
small portion of it is placed in the
mouth it swells like rice in a kettle.
When boiled this substance tastes like
potato and is nearly as palatable.
"The men wear only a gee string
and occasionally a tapis cloth. The
women wear the tapis and a grass and
rattan covering that is a very beauti
ful piece of handiwork. The women do
most of the work in the rice fields.
TRIBES ARE IGNORANT.
"I was well treated during my stay
with the Ifugoa. Never at any time
had I occasion to complain and they"
even gave me privilege to select men or
women to carry my plates and camera
outfit during my excursions into the
country. Their huts are similar to those
of the Tagalo race except where there
is water and in this event the dwellings
are built over the streams or the inlets
on raised platforms. I was assigned to
comfortable quarters and treated with
deference. I learned to speak their
language and found that while there is
certainly more cruelty In thejr disposi
tions they have many traits Of charac
ter that are admirable, one of them
.being generosity.
"I left the tribe with regret and it is
my intention to return to them some
day, for I can with truth say that I
enjoyed my stay among them. There
were times, of course, when I had
disagreeable experiences passing from
one tribe to another and my life was
frequently in danger, but as soon as
DENIES STORY
OF MRS. DUKE
Murat Masterson, Attorney
of Colorado Springs, Says
Shooting Was Done by Her
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Jan.
15.âMurat Masterson takes exception
to the statement attributed to Mrs.
Alice Webb, now Mrs. Brodie D. Duke,
to the effect that he shot her in the
hand in 1890. Masterson is a well
known attorney of this city. Said he
to-day:
I first met Mrs. Webb, then Mrs. Hopkin
son, in the summer of 1890 at the Washington
Park race course in Chicago. I was legal
counsel for Don Luis Huller, one of the largest
land and mine owners of Mexico. We had
several deals under way, and Mrs. Hopklnson
introduced me to several capitalists in New
York. I waited until May, 1891. and then
finally asked her for the papers which I had
turned over to her to present to her backers.
She was then living in a flat on Thirty-sev
enth street. At first she declined to give up
the business and papers, but after several
meetings she decided to do so.
When I entered her rooms I found two men
strangers to me, there. After a few words I
found that I was going to have trouble to se
cure possession of the papers, which I saw on
the mantel of the room. I was unarmed, but
finally drove her two friends from the room
and out through the hall. When I returned
to her room Mrs. Hopklnson held a pistol in
her hands and fired point blank at me, the
bullet whizring past my head and burying it
self In the door frame. I, renched the piitol
from her hand and threw it Into the hall. I
then took possession of the documents and left
the house. Both Mrs. Hopklnson and-myself
were arrested and taken to Jefferson Market
police station and next morning we were both
taken into the Police Court, but the cas* waa
dismissed and that was the end of it.
VICTIM OF CARBON MONOXIDE.âThomas

they understood that my intentions
were peaceful they received me with
hospitality."
"The tribes of this out of the way
district know nothing of the changes
that have been wrought in the history
of the islands in the last five years.
They have seldom been disturbed and
care little whether Spaniards or Ameri
cans rule the archipelago. I took
nearly 2000 photographs of the tribes I
visited.
"The head-hunting expeditions were
conducted with a preliminary dance
and exchange of charms. The custom
is part of their religion and has been
handed down to them through genera
tions of cannibalism, of which they
have a fund of interesting legends. The
dance over, tbe hunting parties vanish
in the woods, thread their way through
hopeless tangles of jungle, and for days
press onward, subsisting on roots and
grasrhoppers. They return to the vil
lages in triumph with the heads and
bodies of their victims and in the orgies
that follow no civilized man would care
to take part."
Mr. Murphy thinks the United States
is going to have much trouble with the
Philippines unless the natives are ruled
with force. The Government policy has
been conciliatory, and the whites in
Manila and elsewhere are shown less
consideration than the Filipinos. This
policy is one of pacification, and to in
sure confidence in the American Gov
ernment, but Murphy says it is a
wrong one, as the Filipino knows a
master only when that master rules
him with iron hand.
MANY DESERT
NIEDRINGHAUS
Several Republicans Bolt
to Defeat Him for the
Senatorship of Missouri
KANSAS CITY. Nov. 15.âA special
to the Times from Jefferson City, Mo.,
says that enough Republicans have
bolted to defeat the ratification next
Tuesday of T. K. Niedringhaus, the
State chairman, recently named by the
Republicans in caucus to succeed
United States Senator Cockrell.
It was given out to-night that at a
dinner held Saturday night, attended
by nine members of the Legislature, an
agreement was reached to defeat
Niedringhaus. Major J. L. Blttinger
of St. Joseph, who presided at the con
ference, announced that besides the
members present five other Republi
cans had agreed to bolt the caucus
nominee if called upon to do so.
Representative Grace of St. Louis,
who introduced the resolution that
caused the investigation of the Nied
ringhaus fund held in St. Louis last
week, was present at the dinner.
A second conference of bolters was
held in Jefferson City to-night, and at
its conclusion some of those present
stated positively that Niedringhaus
would not be elected on Tuesday. The
followers of Niedringhaus, however,
are confident that he will be elected.
They maintain that the investigation
at St, Louis clearly vindicated him.
At the Republican caucus held here
on January 5 Niedringhaus was select
ed to succeed Senator Cockrell after a
spirited contest, in which five ballots
were taken. The final ballot stood:
Niedringhaus 58, Colonel R. C. Kerens
of St. Louis 29, Major William Warner
of Kansas City 1. L. F. Parker 4 and
Patrick Dyer of St. Louis 1.
The conference last Saturday night
was held following a dinner given by
ASK NEW LAWS
IN PHILIPPINES
Commissioners Want Tariff
Beduced and a Big Sum
for Future Improvements
ANNUAL BEPOBT MADE
Bailroad Work and Control
of Shipping Desired for
Islands by the Leaders
WASHINGTON. Jan. 15.âThe annual
report of the Philippine Commission to
the Secretary of War says that is soon
as the people came to understand that
the Government had both the ability
and the will to protect them they began
to co-operate cordially with the con
stabulary and other peace officers.
The non-Christian tribes of the pro
vince as soon as they understood the
Americans would protect them against
their ancient enemy, the Moros, were
only too willing to recognize American
i authority and receive the benefits of
| protection.
The report says that a pacific policy
j toward the Moros seemed to give them
| the impression that the Americans
j were afraid of them, but a short, deci
sive campaign gave them to under
; stand that the Americans had not only
I the purpose, but the power, to support
i authority and enforce order.
'"There is no reason," it is added, "to
i expect any further trouble with the
i Sulu Moros."
! The report, after referring to the sat
j isfactory adjustment of the friar lands
question, says there still continues to
â  be much controversy and ill feeling be-
I tween the independent Filipino church
I âor Aglipayans, as they are commonly
j called âand the Roman Catholic apos
! tolic church in regard to the churches,
convents and cemeteries in many locali
ties.
I The report urges that the commission
be given authority to make reductions
in the tariff schedules, the commission
saying in this connection that it always
I has felt there should exist the most
intimate trade relations between the
United States and the islands.
RECOMMENDATIONS MADE.
The commission makes the following
recommendations:
Reduction of the tariff on sugar and
| tobacco to not more than 25 per cent of
j the Dingley rate.
That authority be given the commis
! sion, with the approval of the Presl
i dent and Secretary of War, to issue
â¢ bonds from time to time for future im
| provements, not to exceed $75,000,000 in
' the aggregate.
Legislatiqn exempting all bonds is
! sued by the Philippine Government or
1 any of the provincial or municipal gov-
I ernments, not only from Federal or
â  Philippine taxation, but from State,
' county and municipal taxation in the
United States.
That control of the shipping be left
wolly to the discretion of the Philip
pine Commission, subject to the ap
! proval of the President and Secretary
jof War.
| That the application of the United
States coastwise navigation laws to the
trade between the Philippines and the
mainland of the United States be post
' pcned by Congressional action until
1 July 1, 1909, or, in the alternative, that
the coastwise laws of the United States
Ibe not made applicable to the trade
\ between the islands and the mainland,
except with a proviso or condition that
the rates upon imports from the Phil
ippines into the United States shall not
pay duty in excess of 25 per cent of the
Dingley tariff,
j Congressional action authorizing the
â¢ Philippine Commission, with the ap-
I proval of the President and Secretary
! of War, to encourage railroad eonstruc-
I tion in the islands by accompanying
1 the grants or franchises, when deemed
I necessary, with a guaranty by the
: Philippine Government of income on the
' amount of the investment, to be fixed
! in advance in the act of guaranty, the
amount of Income guaranteed not to
i exceed annually 4 per. cent of the fixed
principal.
SLAVERY AMONG MOROS.
In his report as Civil Governor of
! Moro province, General Wood says
slave trading hasj been brought prac
tically to an end: throughout the sea
coast Moro districts, although he says
it undoubtedly continues to some ex
tent between the inland Moros and the
â  savage tribes of the interior. General
I Wood says it would be difficult to
1 imagine a worse form of slavery, the
! slave having absolutely*no rights.
In submitting the report, Secretary
Taft says ladronism is confined to the
Lake Lanao region and the Island of
Jolo.
As to finances he says that from the
central government last year the
amount expended did not exceed
$1,200,000, as against $1,600,000 the pre
vious year. He adds that without
wasting money, $5,000,000 a year In the
maintenance of the public schools of
the Philippine islands could be readily
expended. The enrollment has Increas
ed from 183,000 to 263,000 In one year,
and there Is a demand for American
teachers and Filipino teachers in each
province. The total expenditures for
education last year, including those
from central provinces and municipal
governments, was nearly $2,000,000.
MISSION TO ABYSSINIA
BEARS FRUIT IN TRADE
Consul General Skinner Reports That
Business Between the Countries
Is on the Increase.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 15.âHow rap
idly the good results of the American
commercial expedition to Abyssinia,
which brought about the commercial
treaty between the United States and
that country, are'beginning to be felt
is seen from a report to the State De
partment from Skinner, the American
Consul General at Marseilles, in which
he says that many American orders
are now being shipped direct to Abys
sinia and that trade between the two
countries is increasing steadily.
Tower, the American Embassador
at Berlin, has reported that Germany,
following the example of this Govern
ment is sending a distinguished com
mission to King Menelik with a view
to increasing Germany's trade with
Abyssinia.
Colonel Kerens. After the dinner and
before the conference began Colonel
Kerens withdrew, saying he did not
wish to be a party to the deliberations.
ST. LOUIS, Jan. 15.âLast night
Colonel R. C. Kerens gave a dinner to
a number of his legislative friends at
hie home in St. Louis, and as a result
of that dinner, it is said, Colonel
Kerens does not consider himself out of
the Senatorial race. The men in confer
ence, together with the others whom
they claim to have with them, will
"criss-cross" on the vote in the General
Assembly on United States Senator on
Tuesday. This will leave the strength
of the movement undeveloped, so that
when they 'ballot in joint session on
Wednesday the "criss-cross" can be
worked by switching votes to beat
Niedringhaus.
ENORMOUS ARMIES
WILL SOON RESUME
BATTLE OF SHAKHE
Mistchenkos Raid Believed to Be the
â  Forerunner of an Advance
by Kuropatkin.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. IB.âThe
War Office does not admit that the ap
pearance of General Mlstchenko's cav
alry southwest of Liaoyang is more
than a daring expedition designed to
strike the railroad at several points
and interrupt the transportation of
General Nogi's guns from Port Arthur
to Manchuria, but from certain indi
cations it seems possible that it is pre
liminary to operations of magnitude.
General Mistchenko has more than
20,000 horsemen, and, moving rapidly,
might be able to seriously damage
ccrnmunication in the rear of Liayong.
Dispatches from some Russian cor
respondents vaguely hint at very im
portant developments and the military
writer for the Novoe Vremya expresses
the opinion that the long calm since
the battle of Shakhe is about to be
broken. It is also noteworthy that
there have been no official dispatches
from General Kuropatkin for two
days.
LONDON. Jan. 16. âA dispatch to
Lloyds' from Yinkow, dated January
li">, gives a report that General Mits
chenko's raiding force was cut off on
its way back by 8000 Japanese dis
patched from Sanlihoo by General
Oku. This report, however, is not con
firmed from any other source.
The Daily Telegraph's Chefu corre
spondent says the raid was only a
divergence from a mass of cavalry now
moving down the banks of the Liao
River and the exceptional mildness of
the season affords a chance for the
repetition of such operations.
The tone of the rescript addressed
by Emperor Nicholas to the army and
navy is regarded here as putting an
end to all present hopes of the possi
bility of mediation or peace and as
indicating the likelihood that General
KuropUtkin soon will resume the of
fensive.
HUANCHANG, Friday, Jan. 13.â
There has been no serious fighting for
several days, though night skirmishes
on both sides continue. The most im
portant action recently was that in
which Caotains Koslnoff and Troitgki,
with seventy-five Cossacks, drove the
Japanese out of the villages of Mitzi
and Tkhangay and captured a large
amount of forage at both places. Gen
eral Linevitch has been inspecting the
whole front and finds that the men
and supplies are in excellent condi
tion. The Japanese on their side are
pushing sapping operations toward the
Russian lines at several points, but
have not made serious progress.
TOKIO, Jan. 15. âLater reports
from Newchwang indicate that Gen
eral Mlstchenko's Cossacks in their re
cent raiding southwest of Liaoyang de
liberately invaded neutral territory
and broke the limits of the war zone.

PROSPERS DESPITE WAR.
Increased Exports Denote Growth in
Japan's Commerce.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 15. â
Department has received an interest
ing report from Griscom, the Ameri
can Minister to Tokio, dealing with
the present economic conditions in
Japan and her trade relations with the
United States. Griscom. in several sta
tistical contributions compiled from
official sources, compared the first
nine months of the present conflict
with the same time last year.
The present year shows an increase
in exports of $6,424,159 and an in
crease Â»n imports of $10,080,597. Dur
ing the same period the of
exports in specie and bullion amount
ed to $41,403,394 and the increase in
imports to $1,842,370.
During the period in review exports
to the United States were valued at
$33,898,622 and imports therefrom at
$19,719,486. showing, as compared
with the same period of 1903, an in
crease in exports of $3,919,277 and an
increase in imports of $2,702,538. Raw
silk was the principal item of export,
showing a marked increase. There
was a reduced export of tea and coal.
Kerosene oil, leather, rails, flour and
sugar were imported from the United
States in larger quantities than dur
ing the same period last year, while
raw cotton imports declined.
Griscom describes the readiness with
which the Japanese domestic loans
have been floated.
The total amount of the national
debt of Japan at the end of Septem
ber stoodÂ»at about $444,216,000, mak
ing a debt per capita of about $9 46.

vessels and the town is much better
than hoped for. Evidently there was
much fortifying of the place after the
siege commenced. Two Hundred and
Three Meter Hill had no permanent
works. The trenches were similar to
those used by the Boers in their late
war with Great Britain. It seems that
the Russians had no general electric
scheme, movable engines, dynamos or
powerful fort searchlights.
"The Russian naval officers yet say
little and It is impossible to ascertain
whether our fire or the opening of the
seacocks by the Russians themselves
sank their ships in the harbor.
"The hospitals were scattered and
were fairly well kept. They are still
being used for wounded prisoners.
"It is understood that up to the capit
ulation pf the fortress the garrison re
ceived only special allowances of
money, but before the surrender Gen
eral Stoessel paid them off. This, to
gether with the constant purchase of
supplies by the Russians from Junk
men, may explain-why no treasure fell
into the hands of the Japanese.
"The treatment of the Japanese pris
oners at Port Arthur did not compare
with that accorded Russian prisoners
here. At Port Arthur the Japanese
prisoners were given poor food and
were not given fuel. Only twice were
they permitted outside their prison."
It is reported that hundreds of Jap
anese fishermen have been sent to
Port Arthur to assist in the clearing
out of mines.
STOESSEL'S MEN UNRULY.
British Correspondent Says Drunken
ness Was Common in Stronghold.
LONDON, Jan. 15.âUnder date of
January 15, the Port Arthur
spondent of the Times says:
"General Nogl, attended by his staff,
the divisional commanders and foreign
attaches, reviewed detachments of all
arms in the new Town Square to-day.
There was a stirring display. The gen
erals afterward marched through the
town, which shows few signs of the
bombardment. No casualties occurred
among the women or children who lived
in the houses throughout the siege.
Champagne was always obtainable.
There waa little dystentery or typhus,
but much scurvy, owing to the lack of
vegetables.
"It seems that General Stoessel was
responsible for the fortifying of Roju
Hill. Many of his military officers were
useless, applying for leave on occasions
of attack and leaving their commands
to sergeants. The naval officers were
useless and generally ! drunk. The
whole navy was demoralized by the
death of Admiral Makaroff. which pro
duced marked apathy. At a confer
ence the capitulation, some
of the fort commanders voted for fur-
ther resistence, but they were over
ruled by General Stoessel. When news
of the capitulation became public, sol
diers looted the stores of 5000 bottles of
vodka, resulting in terrible orgies in
the streets. Troops sent to quell the
disturbance joined in with the revelers.
"The food supply was sufficient to
last three months, but there was no
meat except horse flesh. No private
stores were seized. The steamship
King Arthur brought 5000 sacks of
flour early in December."
GRIEVANCE AGAINST ENGLAND
Russian Press Claims Japanese Are
Using British Island as Rase.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 15.âSome
of the newspapers here are claiming
that the Japanese are using the lower
island of Laulian, near Borneo, as a
base, and that the British are conceal
ing fact by preventing communi
cation between Borneo and Singapore,
on the ground that the cable is under
going repair.
The report from Washington that it
is believed there that the powers will
informally protest to Russia against
the notice served by her that she will
consider herself no longer bound to
regard the neutrality of China if Ja
pan continues to violate it, has created
astonishment here, where it is held
that any protest should be directed
against the action of Japan, against
which Russia has now thrice warned
the powers. Russia's position is that
she is bound under the circumstances
to take steps for the protection of her
own interests.
Stoessel Thanks the Kaiser.
NAGASAKI. Jan. 16.âThe British
steamship Roseley. which was cap
tured on January 11 by the
Japanese cruiser Tekiwa in the
Sea of Japan, has arrived at Sasebo,
where she will be tried by the prize
court on the charge of having at
tempted to carry coal to Vladivostok.
Generall Stoessel has cabled his
thanks to the Emperor of Germany
for the decoration conferred upon
him. Passage for General Stoessel
and his party has been booked to
Port Said.

Efforts Being Made to Unite Seceding
Faction With Parent
Organization.
DENVER, Jan. 15.âNegotiations
have been*opened by the officers of the

in the Cattle Growers' Association, be
lieving that it can be made of benefit
to the united livestock Interests of the

Disappearance of Well-Known Butte
County Veterinarian Is the Cause
of Much Concern.
BIGGS, Jan. 16.âThe friends .of
Charles S. Brown, a pioneer veterinary
surgeon fbf this place, are greatly
alarmed owing* to the absence of

that no one has seen or heard from
him since he left John Richer's livery
stable in Oroville Saturday, January 7,
for his home in Biggs. Brown's dis

SKIPPER'S WIFE MUTINIES
ON SCHOONER ANNIE SMALL
In a Discussion With the Mate Mrs.
Wlrschuleit Poors Boiling
Coffee Over-Him.
If the schooner Annie Small had
been on the high seas instead of the*
placid mud flats near the Fourth
street bridge Mrs. Wlrschuleit, wife of
the skipper, would be In the brig for
mutiny. During an argument on board
the vessel she smote the first mate,
Alfred Howard, on the nose and
poured a half gallon of hot coffee over
his head.
Mrs. Wlrschuleit is one of the crew,
according to Howard, but she seems
to imagine that she is Lord High Ad
miral of the bay scow fleet During
the absence of the captain the mate
piped his crew, consisting of Mrs.
Wlrschuleit, on deck to dip the en
sign to a passing vessel.
"Man the foretop gallants and dip
the ensign," shouted the mate.
"Dip it yourself," retorted the crew,
as it lifted its skirts and strode
haughtily into the galley.
"Mutiny!" cried the mate, and fol
lowed her to remonstrate. The lady
swung a wicked right to his eye. He
countered on the gentle mariner's jaw,
sending her to the ropes. The lady
sidestepped and seized a pot filled
with boiling coffee and drenched the
mate with the contents.
The fair crew was towed to the
Southern police station and Howard
put in at the Central Emergency Hos
pital for. repairs. He will be on the
dry-dock for several days. He says
that next time his gentle mariner
starts a mutiny the trouble will be
settled with a belaying pin.
ARIZONA MUST
BE ELIMINATED
Small Hope for Statehood
Bill Unless Compromise
Is Quickly Agreed Upon
BABD'S PLAN FAVOBED
Would Strike From the Meas
ure the Names of Both
Southwestern Territories
WASHINGTON, Jan. 15.âThe Inten
tion Is to keep the Statehood bill to the
front In the Senate during the present
week, with the hope on the part of its
friends that they may be able to get
a vote upon it. Thus far. the oppo
nents of the measure have held out
stubbornly against naming a day for
a vote, and while they do not say in
explicit terms that it is their intention
to filibuster against the passage of the
bill, it is evident that unless a compro
mise can be reached for the elimina
tion of Arizona from the measure they
will make an effort to prevent a vote
before the close of the present session.
On this account there is coming to
be more or less discussion of plans for
tbe modification of the bill and most
of the talk gravitates toward the sug
gestion of Senator Foraker for separa
tion of the votes of Arizona and New
Mexico on the question of admission,
or that suggested by Senator Bard,
confining the operation of the bill to
the creation of the State of Oklahoma
out of the Territory of Oklahoma and
Indian Territory and entirely eliminat
ing Arizona and New Mexico from the
bill. A number of Republicans have
announced themselves favorable to
either of these suggestions
The important work before the
House this week is the disposition of
the Swayne case.

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
RACETRACK DEVOTEE
ARRESTED FOR THEFT
Young Russian Gambles Away Legacy
and Later Robs His Employers.
EMIL IORMUS TAKEN SOUTH FOR TRIAL
OAKLAND, Jan. 15.âEmile Formus,
' who was arrested yesterday morning
at Golden Gate station of the Berkeley
â¢ broad-gauge line on demand of the Los
Angeles police, proves to be a young
Russian who has ruined himself by his j
â¢devotion to racetrack gambling. After ,
squandering an inheritance recently j
â¢ received from a relative in Russia, he \
became a thief in order to continue his
efforts to break the "bookies.'' He is ;
now on his way to Los Anlgeles to be '
tried for his crime. \
Formus stole a $3CO diamond rins in
â  Los Angeles from Mrs. S. D. Parker.
She and her husband had formerly em
. ployed Formus at their hotel at Holly- j
wood, a suburb of Los Angeles. They
implicitly trusted the young man.

WANTS TO KILL
SALOON EVIL
General Mac Arthur Is Deter
. mined to End Sale of
Liquors at Post Gates
ASKS PUBLIC FOR HELP
Â»
Thinks State Should Pass a
Bill So Strong That Au
thorities Must Enforce It
General Mac Arthur, commander of
the division of the Pacific, is making
a great struggle to remedy the saloon
evil that exists about the entrances to
the Presidio. Through the newspa
â¢ pers, "he appeals to the public of Ban
Francisco to help him in his efforts.
General Mac Arthur greatly regrets
â¢that the Keane bill introduced at the
session of the Senate on January 2 tor
prohibiting the selling or giving away
intoxicating liquors within 1000 feet
of any entrance to a United States
military reservation should have come
â¢to such an untimely end. He says he
understands that one of the members,
when this bill was introduced jumped
up and said that if it was passed, pro
hibiting saloons within 1000 feet of
the' entrance to the Presidio, it would
result in closing up a lot of hotels.
Upon this statement Keane cut down
the distance from 1000 feet to 500
feet.. The bill was then tabled.
General Mac Arthur says he wants
to be the father of a bill, and is will
ing to be quoted as saying that he
wants a bill passed so strong that the
municipal authorities must enforce it.
He declares that a bill to carry out
this object and assist the military au
thorities should be so constructed as
to prevent the establishment of any
saloon, or liquor selling resort, within
1000 feet of the reservation lines. This
bill should apply to all posts within
the State that are ndw established or
. may be established.
Some good has already come from
the exertions of General Mac Arthur,
through his persistence in insisting
that Mayor Schmltz should see that
the law was enforced regarding the
saloons at the Presidio gates. As a
result of the recent efforts of the mu
nicipal authorities, a number of ar
rests of saloon-keepers have been
made. Some of those arrested have
gone free owing to technicalities, but
three have been convicted by Juries,
after having demanded such trials.
Judge Cabanlss, in passing sentence,
has indicated his intention to punish
the violators of the law with increas
ing severity, and he has already im
posed 1300 fines in these cases.
Unless something is done, in this
matter General Mac Arthur says the
Presidio will in a measurejreceive the
same censure that was visited upon
Bremerton. It will be remembered
that the riotous proceedings at that
place, caused by the close proximity
of the saloons to the navy yard there,
caused the Government to close the
shops. The Government even went so
far as to declare that unless the evil
there was suppressed, the navy yard
would be abandoned altogether.
Thereupon the citizens of Bremerton
got together and forced the common
council to pass an ordinance to pre
vent the sale of liquor there, so the
navy yard Is still open. Of ceurse the
Government has no intention of mov
ing the present post from the Presidio,
hut General Mac Arthur says .if the
citizens of California do not care to
assist him and the military authorities
In closing up the grog shops and
brothels within a reasonable distance
of the reservations it is not likely the
Government will be disposed to make
further allotments for the beautifying
and adornment of the military posts
within this State.

din. who witnessed the act. called the

ceiving Hospital. He will recover.
his share in a relative's estate. Imme
diately he quit work, deciding he could
make a fortune by "playing the
races." He went to Ascot Park and
tried until the last cent was gone. He
had volubly admired Mrs. Parker's
valuable gem and told her he intended
to buy it. Thus he learned where she
kept the 'circlet.
One day after he had been examining
the diamond the owner missed it. In
quiry revealed that Formus had also
disappeared. The Los Angeles police
traced the ring to a pawnshop, where
it was recovered. Formus, with the
money he had raised on the gem. came
to Oakland. At the Emeryville track
he lost all but $4 of the fruits of his
Jheft. He was arrested on a telegraph
ed warrant from the south.
Detective J. W. Murphy of Los An
geles departed on the Owl train to
night with Formus.

OF WHEELER
Santa Barbara Chamber of
Commerce Indorses Plan
for Agricultural Work
URGES APPROPRIATIONS
Southern Californians Desire
to See University Depart
ment Greatly Broadened
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Jan. 15.
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler to
day received a communication from the
Chamber of Commerce of Santa Bar
bara which embodies encouraging re
sults of his visit to the State Farmers'
Institute recently held there. The
Chamber of Commerce has adopted
resolutions relating to the broadening
and general extension of the univer
sity's work in the agricultural depart
ment, and these have been sent to the
university authorities. They are as fol
lows:
Whereas, During recent years the agricul
tural college of the University of California
has teen rendering lnvealuable service to the
farming interests of the State; and '
Whereas, the additions of a department *6f
dairying, a department of plant pathology, a
bureau of correspondence inetruction. a depart
ment of irrigation, and the extension of the
work in viticulture, entomology, bacteriology,
veterinary science and institute instruction are
deeply appreciated and call for encouragement
to further endeavors; and
Whereas, The expansion along all these
lines has made the present buildings of the
college utterly insufficient for its needs; and
Whereas, We believe there should be large
and generous treatment of the college on the
part of the State, that it should be fully and
properly equipped, and that it should be the
peer of the agricultural college of any State
in the Union;
Therefore, Be it resolved, by the Board of
Directors of the Chamber of Commerce of
Santa Barbara County, That we recommend
that the Legislature provide the means for a
building at Berkeley worthy of the Depart
ment of Agriculture and equal to that pro
posed for the Department of Mining; that ap
propriation be made for a proper farm for illus
tration and instruction, and that increased
provision be made for special InvestigaUon of
plant disease* and the study of special prob
lems affecting the plant and animal products
of the State.
Resolved, That copies of these resolutions bo
sent to our representatives in the Legislature
and to his Excellency, Governor Pardee.

"talking tree" that has been there for
some time. Enormous crowds con.inue
to congregate there almost every Sun
day to hear the strange noises that
emanate from the tree. The voice can
be distinctly heard and says: "There
are treasures buried at my roots." A
party consisting of the most reliable
citizens of the country visited the tree
not long since to make a thorough in
vestigation for themselves as to the
noises being heard. They listened pa
tiently for several hours and were pre
paring to leave for home when a sud
den crash, which has been given many
times before the marvelous production
of a human voice, came. The mystery
yet remains unsolved, and so great has
the number of people been who have
gone there in the past several months
that the tree is now dead, caused by
the continuous tramping on the earth
surrounding the tree. The only theory
that has been suggested is that a man
was killed under the tree in 1862, and
while many do not believe in "spirits,"
the facts are so plain and the voice can
be so distinctly heard that they can
not dispute the fact. A family of peo
ple who lived there many years ago
became so frighened from the voice
that they sold their farm tat a sacri
fice and went West and are now liv
ing In Texas.âPaducah News.
Senator Beat the Chaplain.
Chaplain Edward Everett Hale has
a lively interest in the spiritual wel
fare of his Senatorial charges. ''Sen
ator," said he to a well-known mem
ber of that body recently, "I have
never heard you say you were a mem
ber of the church." "Oh, yes!" replied
this worldly man of the upper house
in polite phrases. "I was a member of
the old Plymouth Church," naming
also the city where he resided. "So
glad to hear it," rejoined Dr. Hale in
those hearty tones for which he is
famous. Two or three days later he
encountered the same Senator and
warily observed: "I have been looking
up the* history of old Plymouth
Church, but I find it w.as burned
eighteen years ago." "Very true," said
the Senator, unperturbed: "but I be
longed there twenty years ago and
have always retained my member
ship."âChicago Chronicle. '
Growth of the Churches.
Despite the clatter about outworn
creeds and the anxious look in the faces
of amateur diagnosticians as they sit
up with the church and feel its pulse,
the statistics are still on the tide of the
church. They show It vital, not mori
bund. The figures for practically every
denomination show a percentage of
growth during 1904 larger than the in
crease In population. There is not such
a drift away from traditional theology
as many would have the world believe.
The average person Is not as deter
mined to break away from the faith of
the fathers as Is currently represented.
The truth Is the pulpit has always
taken far more interest in theological
puzzles than the pews, and there can
be a mighty churning of the doctrinal
waters without the church rank and
file becoming disturbed.âNew Tork

RECORDS SHOW
BIG INCREASE
More Than Two Thousand
New buildings Erected in
Alameda County in Year
REALTY MARKET ACTIVE
Dealers Report Better Busi
ness Than Ever Before
During Month of January
Oakland Office, San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 15.
The records of new buildings in Ala
meda County, kept by the secretary of
the Alameda County Planing Mill
Owners' Association, which are more
nearly complete than the records kept
by municipal authorities, show that ap
proximately 2200 residence structures
were erected in Oakland, Alameda and
Berkeley during 1904. This far exceeds
the number in any previous year and
indicates better than anything else the
rapid development of the eastern shore
of the bay.
Official records kept by Sanitary In
spector S. F. Gemmell, and published
by the Oakland Health Department,
show that 853 new buildings were erect
ed in Oakland alone.
From tni .se statistics a conservative
estimate would place the year's actual
increase in the population of Alameda
County at 10,000, and that of Oakland
at about 50u0. Many of the newcom
ers to Oakland business men,
who have not only erected homes, but
have entered at once into the com
mercial life of the community.
The approximate cost of the new
buildings in Oakland, Alameda and
Berkeley, and of the improvements in
stores and offices, figured from the es
timates of a number N of well-known
architects and builders, was about $6,
--000,000. The cost of new buildings in
the remaining sections of the county is
estimated by the same men, among
whom are Councilman W. J. Baccus
and J. B. McKeon, secretary of the
Planing Mill Owners' Association, to
be about $2,000,000, making the total
amount expended in new buildings in
the county approximately $8,000,000.
Mr. McKeon, in discussing the
growth of the county, as well as of
Oakland, said to-day:
After reviewing the records of thle office
and estimation the number of Jobs supplied
with mill work by the mills ownod by mem
bers of the association, I believe that the closest
possible approximate estimate of the residence
buildings erected in Oakland, Berkeley and
Alameda'during the year of 1904 would place
the number at about 2200.' About 70 per cent
of these consist of two-story or higher struc
tures, the remaining 30 per cent being one
story houses and cottages.
The reason of any uncertainty as to building
figures Â« that in the past any contractor de
siring to erect any class of structure for
almost any purpose could do so, provided that
the fire ordinance and street regulations were
not involved, without applying to the authori
ties for a permit of any kind. Consequently
no .complete record of this most important
factor in the development of our city has been
kept and it is therefore impossible to secure
accurate statistics as to the increase in the
building industry during the year Just ended.
Until very recently no city ordinance has
required persons erecting buildings within the
city limits of Oakland to apply (or a permit
from the Board of Public Works. I understand
that the new building ordinance, which has
Just been passed to print, requires permits
for all building work.
Sanitary Inspector Stewart F. Gem
mell, said:
The reports of the Sanitary Inspector's office
for the year of, 1904 show that 853 new build
ings were erected in the city of Oakland dur
ing the twelve months Just ended. These re
ports deal only with the buildings in which
new plumbing has been done, taking no
account of the many thousands of dollars ex
pended in improvements in stores, office build
ings an dwellings, of which no record has been
kept by the Sanitary Inspector. Following is
the detailed report of new buildings erected
within the city limits during the last year,
as submitted to the Board of Health: Private
dwellings, 588; flats, 217; additions, 69; stores
and dwellings, 32; new work in old buildings,
84; warehouses, 3; hospitals, 2; banks, 2; fac
tories, 2; one business college, one theater,
one cannery, one engine house, one railroad
station, one freight office and one nurses'
home.
The present condition of the local
real estate market that the
record of the present year will be even
better than that of 1904. At this sea
son immediately after the opening of
the new year, dealers expect a dull
market, but this year they have been
agreeably disappointed. The market
is much more active than ever before
during January and there is every
reason to believe the present prosper
ity will continue.
The erection of the new plant for the
Seattle Brewing Company, to be lo
cated at First and Jackson streets,
has already begun. The contract calls
for its completion within ninety days.
The new building will be 62x120 feet,
and two stories in height, of brick and
concrete, and will cost $20,000. It Will
have the most modern machinery.
At the regular meeting yesterday of
the Oakland Real Estate Association of
the Hotel Metropole the annual elec
tion of officers was held, resulting as
follows: President, John T. Bell; vice
president, Will J. Lavmance; secre
tary, Henry A. Dodge: treasurer, Har
ry X* Holcomb; executive committeeâ
Frank J. Woodward, A. J. Snyder, H.
B. Belden. Retiring Treasurer Sny
der's report showed a good balance on
hand.
A committee of three members was
appointed to interview the Board of
Health, looking toward the removal
from the outside of its building of the
large map showing the location of con
tagious disease, as strangers are apt to
get the impression that Oakland is a
very unhealthy place unless they look
very closely, as few do, and see how
few cases there really are.
Articles of incorporation have just
been filed with the County Clerk by
the Overland Planing Mill Company,
which intends at once to begin the
erection of a planing mill at Emery
ville. The capitalization is $10,000. The
directors are: E. F. Seward of Emery
ville, P. C. Ashenfelter and Alex Mur
doek of Oakland. M. E. Allen of Elm
hurst and F. L, aW rence of San Fran
cisco.
An important deal in Berkeley real
estate was the purchase last week by
M. A. Cheek of a large building lot on
the northwest corner of Dwight way
and Telegraph avenue. The property
was purchased from Julius "Salzberger
and the buyer intends to begin the
erection of a large business block on
the lot in the near future.
The Havwards Board of Trade held
its first meeting of 1905 last Wednes
day, and a large amount of important
business was transacted. The princi
pal object of the meeting was to con
sider the skimming station which the
Eden Creamery is to establish at Hay
wards. Fifteen hundred dollars' worth
of stock in the new station has been
subscribed for by prominent business
men of Haywards.

Comment on Detective's Nar

Thinking of Possible Fate
BREAKS HIS RESERVE
Says He Might as Well Have
Been Killed in the Fight
That Led ~to His Capture
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 15.
David Kiniry, awaiting trial on a
charge of murdering Policeman James
,H. Smith, to-day for the flrfet time since
his return to Oakland in custody gave
expression to a realization of his peril
ous position. \t was during a conversa
tion this afternoon at the County Jail
with Detective J. W. Murphy of Los
Angeles that the hitherto phlegmatic
burglar made a suggestion that indi
cated he had been thinking of his pos
sible doom.
Murphy told Kiniry that the night the
burglar had his battle at the Doheny
residence in Los Angeles he (Murphy)
could have killed the fleeing house
breaker if the detective had known in
time whether Kiniry was the fugitive
or the pursuing watchman. Murphy
was attracted to the grounds by the
pistol shots. He entered the place with
his revolver drawn just as Kiniry
brushed by him, within a few feet of
the officer.
"I didn't dare to shoot then because
I did not know what was doing," ex
plained Murphy. "If I had fired at you
I should surely have killed you, for I
was near enough to have put a bullet
through your head."
"It might have been as well for me if
you had known and had shot me dead,"
replied Kiniry, to the surprise of his
hearers. Never before had the prisoner
so much as Intimated he had given any
thought to the ordeal of a murder trial
he must shortly face.
Kiniry has been advised by his moth
er and stepfather that they purpose
providing funds for his defense. They
have written to him several times, sug
gesting names of prominent Oakland
attorneys he might consult. According
to his Jailers Kiniry has exhibited no
special concern as to that subject. If
anything, he has been dilatory in re
plying to the offers of financial help
from his people.

Call for New Buildings
WATERMAN'S REMARKS
Urgent Need He Says of Pro

Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
214fLCenter Street, Jan. 15.
Supplementing the call of the Board
of Education for a bond election, when
citizens will pass upon the plan to is
sue bonds for $150,000, to be used in
building new schools has come the fol
lowing statement from Superintendent
S. D. Waterman, referring to conditions
as they appear now, since the opening
of the new term of school:
The second term of the current school year
has opened very successfully. The'two un
graded classes have been qrganized, one in the
Lincoln School building, the other in the Mc-
Klnley. An additional class of sixth and sev
enth grade pupils has been opened in the Alls
ton Way building. The pupils for this class
are from fhe North Berkeley district.
The need of six more rooms at the Whlttler
school was never more plain than now. The
four classes at the Allston Way building ars s
composed of pupils living, for the greater part,
north of University avenue. The two classes
at the Rose street school ought to be trans
ferred to the Whittier, making sixteen classes.
These pupils who have been attending school
at buildings at a distance from their homes
have accepted the situation gracefully and
the patrons of the schools have, as a rule,
been very Datient.
The twelve rooms built within the last
eighteen months are filled, several additional
classes have been formed and still in many
of the buildings the classes are crowded.
This Is notable in the upper grades in the
Lincoln, the McKinley, the Whittier and the
La Conte schools. The only relief that will
be permanent must come In additional rooms
and buildings.

IS DEPORTED
Young Government Clerk in
. Manila Sent Home Under
â¢ Guard of an Army Nurse
Pathetically protesting against the
judgment of a military board of sur
geons thai declared her insane and
caused her deportation from the city
of Manila, Miss Lowry, a well-known
' young woman of Cleveland, Ohio, is re
strained of her liberty at the Occiden
tal Hotel, awaiting the action to-day
of the local army officials that will
fret, htr from the custody of an army
nurse and place her in the hands of
Miss Lowry was a passenger on the
transport Sherman, which arrived yes
rdaj from the Philippines. She was
;i â¢ ompanied by Miss B. M. Gertich, an
army nurse, who had been detailed in
Manila to bring the unfortunate young
woman to San Francisco. Here the
la Iter's aunts. Miss C. L. Clark of
Cleveland and Miss G. Woodruff of St.
Davids, Ohio, haye been impatiently
awaiting the arrival of their relative
for several days, it is the second time
that the young woman has been sent
away from the Philippines and both
times it w as for the same reasonâmen-
tal irresponsibility. Four years ago
Mi s Lowry was appointed from Cleve
lt>nd to a civil service position in Man
ila and immediately departed for the
islands in company with several other
young women, who also had been as
signed to duties there.
For a time all went well and her
relatives in Cleveland received pleas
ing letter? discriblng her interesting ex
p- riences in her new home. One day they
were suddenly startled by the informa
tion that Miss Lowry had got into
trouble in Manila and was about t<> be
deported. Later news was to the effect
that the young woman had attempted
to kill Albert Easthagen. a fellow clerk,
In whose company she often had been
seen.
ATTACKS FELLOW CLERK.
According to the stories that reached
this Fide of the Pacific, Mm Lowry
one day approached Easthagen and
suddenly drawing a revolver, pulled the
trigger. It snapped, however, without
discharging the cartridge and a second
later Miss Lowry was disarmed. She
was placed under arrest and for sev
eral months kept under the observation
of army surgeons, who finally recom
mended that their patient he sent
home. Accordingly Miss Lowry was
placed aboard a transport and made
the homeward journey by way of the
. Buefc canal and New York, the hope of
her army friends being that a long
ocean voyage might cure her mind.
About four months ago Miss Lowry
disappeared from Cleveland and quiet
ly made her way back to Manila, w here
sh< was later found acting in a strange
manner, apparently laboring under
hallucinations, one of which, It was
afterward discovered, was that Fili
pinos had been engaged to poison her.
Major H. Carter called the attention
of the Manila Board of Health to the
young woman's sad predicament and
that body ordered her again deported.
By arrangements military au
thorities Miss Gertich, an army nurse,
was detailed to accompany Miss Lowry
to San Francisco on the transport
Sherman, and the relatives of the lat
ter were advised to meet the young
woman on her arrival here.

from Manila Miss Clark . nd Miss
Woodruff prepared for a Journey to this
city, and arriving here several days
ago they went to the Russ House to
await the coming of the Sherman. They
were at the dock yesterday to meet
Miss Lowry, but were not permitted
immediately to take her in charge, the
Government's instructions being that
Miss Gertich should be :elieved of her
responsibilities only on the authority
of the local army officials. Yesterday
being Sunday no effort was made to
effect the change in the custody of the
young woman, who will probably be
given over to her relatives to-day.
INSISTS SHE IS SANE.
Arriving at the Russ House yester
day and discovering that her identity
and unfortunate condition had become
known here, Miss Lowry, with her. at
tendant and aunts, hurriedly moved to
the Occidental Hotel, where they re
luctantly made a statement last even
ing. Miss Lowry insists that she is
perfectly sane, but fatigued after her
two long sea voyages and still troubled
over the experiences attending her de
tention in Manila. When seen last even
ing for a moment she declared that the
charges of insanity were without foun
dation. Referring to her attempt to
shoot Easthagen. she said she had been
forced to do so because of derogatory
remarks he had made against her. Be
fore she could make a further state
ment Miss Gertich and Miss Clark in
sisted that the interview cease, and the
door of the well-guarded young woman
was closed against reporters.
Miss Gertich later admitted that she
had been detailed to accompany Miss
Lowry to San Francisco, and expected
to turn over her charge to the aunts
to-day. Continuing she said:
I am an army nurse, and, in addition to be
ing sent over as companion to Miss Lowry, I
wan officially designated as lier guardian. As
soon as I am authorized to transfer her to the
care of her relatives I will return to the Phllip
liiics Dr. Carter and other medical authori
ties that carefully observed Miss Lowry's case
in Manila agreed that, wniie their patient's
mind was unbalanced, there wan no reason
for believing that she was Incurable. Hallu
cinations seemed to be her principal trouble,
and if not carefully watched It was feared
that she might do harm to others.
NURSE EVER VIGIL.
Miss Lowry is about 27 years of aÂ«e
and not unattractive. During the
voyage over from Manila she conduct
ed herself in a rational manner and
spent the greater part of her time on
deck under the watchful eye of her
attendant. The only time yesterday
she became excited was when she real

YOUTHS BOOKED
FOR BURGLARY
Edward Kennelly and Mark
Hayes Break Into a Shop
and Are Heard by Woman
Two youths, Edward Kennelly, 19
years of age, and Mark Hayes, 17, were
arrested early yesterday morning
through the presence of mind of a wom
an and by the prompt response by the
police to her call for assistance.
Shortly after 3 o'clock Mrs. Charles
Maritzen, Hayes and Laguna streets,
was awakened by a noise in the base
ment, which is occupied by her hus
band as a paint shop. She listened for a
moment and then telephoned to the
City Hall police station that burglars
were breaking into the paint shop. Ser
geant M. J. Griffin and Policemen W.
E. Dowie and F. E. Winters jumped
into a patrol wagon and were rapidly
driven to the scene of the burglary. It
was discovered that a wire screen and
a pane of glass had been removed from
a window of the paint shop and en
trance effected.
Maritzen opened the door with his
key and the officers entered. The two
young burglars were found hiding in
the shop and were promptly arrested.
It was apparent that their object had
been to enter the grocery above the
paint shop. They had utilized a step
ladder and with a saw had cut a hole
in the ceiling. 'A few minutes more
and the hole would have been
enough to enable them to crawl
through into the grocery.
They were taken to the City Prison
and charged with burglary. It is
thought that they are new to the burg
lar business, as they are not known to
the police. Their records will be looked
into this morning.

PRETTY GIRL
ENDS HER LIFE
Grieving Over a Love Affair,
Sarah M. Bryant Becomes
Despondent at Seventeen
Because she thought a man with ]
whom she was infatuated was angry
with her, pretty Sarah Mabel Bryant
committed suicide yesterday by drink
ing carbolic acid. Before she took
the poison the girl destroyed the
man's photograph. In her last pa
thetic note to him she used only his
initial, evidently endeavoring to carry'
her secret to the grave. The girl was
scarcely past 17 years old and w as of a
cheerful disposition until recently. She
was employed as a domestic by Mrs.
Louise Caddy of 948 Guerrero street, at
whose house she committed suicide.
Her aunt, Mrs. M. Kelley, to whom
Sarah confided the farewell note to the
man with whom she was in love, de
clared that she did not know that her
niece had any love affair. Mrs. Kelley
said she did not know the "Fred W."
to whom the dead girl referred.
The young woman returned to Mrs.
Caddy's home from a visit to her aunt
at about 10 o'clock Saturday night.
Mrs. Kelley said that she had com
plained about her health, but not of the
trouble that made her weary of the
world.
In her own room Miss Bryant pre
pared to die in a manner that showed
determination. The oversensitive girl
took "Fred's" picture and tore it to
bits. She next scratched the label from
the vial of carbolic acid and drank its
contents. Her body was discovered yes
terday morning by Mrs. Caddy. The
Coroner was notified and the remains
were taken to the home of her aunt at
2970 Twenty-fifth street.
The following pathetic note to the
man in the case was addressed to "Mr.
F. W.":
My Darling F. âWhen this note it read to you
I will be far away. In the land where all my
sins will be forgiven I know, my darling. I
know now why you were angry, but God
knows lam innocent. It's all for you. dearest.
You said you were not angry, but I know
differently. May God forgive me, for my heart
is broken. I was unfortunate. Good-by. my
love my only love. I hope that you may never
meet with my kind again, but I loved you as
true as any heart could. Think of me, some
times Fred. Farewell, my darling friend.
MABEC BRYANT.
This touching adieu was inclosed in
a note to Mrs. Kelley, which reads as
follows:
Auntie.âGive this letter I have written to F.
Bay nothing about htm; above all, don't tell
who he Is. It will go hard with him. You
know what I told you last night. It's ail true.
I loved him. only him. Good-by, dear auntie
You know where he lives.
The dead girl has borne an excellent
reputation. She was employed by Mrs.
Caddy for about eight months.
The man for whom the girl commit
ted suicide was located last night by
Deputy Coroner P. J. McCormick. He
is Frederick W. Clapp, a motorman on
the Guerrero street line. According to
his story he had only known the girl
for a few months. They had a misun
derstanding a few days ago. Clapp
says he had no idea that the girl was
Infatuated with him.
STOLE WOMAN'S POMPADOUR.âFred
Maxe, who says he is a steward on a trans
port, and two friends are accused of having
stolen articles from a woman in a house at
741 Commercial street. She says one of the
men stole her pompadour, valued at $12. She
says Maxe tried to steal her shoes. He was
arrested by Corporal Coulter. The other two
escaped.
MODERN CRUSOES
RETURN TO PORT
Guardians of Clipperton
Island Beach Home With
Tales of Life Among Birds
The weird tales of Jules Verne and
the history of Robinson Crusoe and
his man Friday have a modern exem
plification in the story told by the party
of three who returned yesterday from
Clipperton Island. They are Luphy
Jerry, John Sousa and Louie Fazio.
For a year they have been isolated on
that desolate spot in the broad waters
of the Pacific.
Yesterday they came back on the
tittle schooner yacht Josephine, which
flitted in through the Golden Gate at
daybreak under a cloud of snow-white
canvas. She looked more like a bird
than a vessel which had been the
home of five human beings for forty
days.
Her passengers had been throuerh all
kinds of experiences. Isolation, winds,
storms, encounters with monsters of
the deep, hair-breadth escapes from
drowning and the other perils that
those who follow the sea in frail craft
are wont to encounter.
The tale as told by Luphy Jerry is
one of thrilling interest. He said that
in company with his two companions
he sailed away from this port on the
schooner Una December 22. 1903. for
Clipperton Island to act as carekeeoers
for the Pacific Island Company of Lon
don, who own the plant at that place.
They arrived there on January 13. 1904.
The Una then returned to this port.
\ They were the only human beings left
on this desolate spot, which is 1850
miles from here and about 700 miles
due west from Acapulco.
( Their life was a strange one. The
I only sound that greeted their ears was
the flapping of the wings of millions
lof birds that inhabit that bleak island
' and the thundering of the great break
| ers as they dashed up on the coral
reefs of the shore. The great deposit
of guano on the islands Is now of in
, calculable value.
CRABS STEAL EGGS.
Immense land crabs infested the is
land, and it was no uncommon occur
rence to see a crab with a large egg in
I its claws making tracks across the tf
| land, at a great rate of speed.
The tropical weather allowed them to
! wear the scantiest of attire, and some
! times it was so hot that they even
; wandered around with only the attire
1 that nature gave them.
For six months the rain came down
lin torrents. They had plenty of can-
I ned food, but needed little of this, as
I ducks and flsh were there in great
i abundance.
They learned to become fond of the
br3ins and liver of porpoises and all
! kinds of big sea monsters. Eggs in
1 great plenty lay at the very door of
their domicile. There were all kinds of
I dainty little flsh, and the lobsters had
i a flne and delicate flavor. In the spring
| great flocks of canvas, mallards and
i teal ducks came within easy shooting
I range. They whiled away their time
! looking after the buildings there, flsh
] Â»ng, hunting and had much time for
â  reading. The plant on the islands has
cost about $50,000. No guano has been
removed from the islands since 1900,
as the property is in litigation.
Among the different varieties of
birds that swarm about the island are
sea gulls, boobies, ganets, terns and
man-of-war hawks.
THEY BEHOLD A SAIL.
No sail and no view of human life
came within the range of. their vision
during their eleven months' sojourn
there, and early in December a speck
appeared upon the horizon. They were
all frantic with joy and rushed down
to the beach, wondering what it could
be. It gradually drew nearer and* to
their amazement came straight toward
them. They had not expected to be
sent for until January, and so thought
that the little vessel had been driven
out of her course. They yelled, shouted
and made all kinds of signals. Sudden
ly the vessel dropped anchor, and a
boat came toward them, and, after a
hard tussle with the breakers, was
landed high and dry on the beach. They
then learned that it was the little
yacht Josephine that had been sent to
bring them back to San Francisco. To
fill their places as caretakers Charles
Larsen and Gus Greenberg went there
and are now on the island.
The Josephine was in command of
Captain Lindridge, with A. Freeman
as first mate. On December 7 last
the party set sail for this port. For
the first few days the weather was
fine. Suddenly a great southeast gale
sprang up, which continued for two
days and pitched the little twenty
tonner around in a lively fashion. In
the midst of the gale Seaman Freeman
was knocked overboard by the main
boom lift being carried away. He fell
almost within the reach of a great
school of sharks. Two of the most
savage of the lot made a grab at him
just as his companions succeeded in
hauling him out of the water. The
weather remained practically fair un
til last Thursday when they encoun
tered a northwest gale. One great
wave swept Louie Fazio overboard,
and had he not been an expert swim
mw he would have been drowned, as
the fury of the gale was so great that
the little yacht was almost unmanage
able. He was finally dragged on board
in an almost unconscious condition.
The Josephine was thirty-nine days
in making the voyage. She is owned
by F. W. Wakefield. As soon as she
landed here the three recluses rushed
ashore and made great haste for their
homes in Oakland, where their people
live. Their Joy at being back again
was unbounded.
NEW MANAGER OF THE
ST. FRANCIS ARRIVES
Jnmes Woods of New York Will
Enter Upon His Important
Duties To-Day.
James Woods of New York, who
was recently chosen by the directors of
the St. Francis Hotel to manage that
handsome hostelry, arrived from the
East last evening with his wife and
will enter upon his new and important
duties to-day. Manager Woods jour
ntyed westward by way of the Sun
set route, and, reaching California a
week ago, came north leisurely, stop
ping off at the more Important towns
in order to become acquainted with
the managers of the different hotels,
to whom he wag introduced by Wil
liam MfMurray, who, with Director
Thomas of, the St. FranciÃ, met Woods
in Los Angeles.
The new manager comes to San
Francisco, with some of the best rec
ommendations ever carried by an
American hotel man. Although com
paratively a young man, Manager
Woods has had valuable experience in
the hotel business, beginning in New
Orleans, where he was manager of
the St. Charles. After a varied ex
perience In other well-known Eastern
hotels he went abroad on an extended
tour, during which he gleaned much.
knowledge of the method of business
among the hotel nyn on the Eastern
continent. Returning to New York he
entered the employ of Manager Boalt
of the Waldorf-Astoria, where he later
became assistant manager. It was In
this important position that Woods
proved his well-earned reputation for
ability and it was this fact that finally
led to negotiations between himself
and the directors of the St. Francis.
In discussing * his new position last
evening he said:
This is my first visit to San Francisco, and.
in view of the fact that I have been in your
city only a few hours, it is not to be expect- .1
that I can have much to say of it. I will tuk>
up the management of the St. Francis to-mor
row. I have been cjoarly informed as to the
peculiar conditions of the hotel business In thlj
city and will carefully study out the best
means of pleasing the California public. I
hope to be successful, and will begin work as
sured of the hearty co-operation of the directors
of the hotel.
W. H. Dohrmann, the auditor of the
hotel company, who has been acting
as it manager since Allan Pollok re
tired, will return to his former dut'es.
During the short time that Dohrmann
had the management of the hotel,
though making no pretension of ex
pert knowledge of the business, he
proved a success and he retires highly
complimented by the guests of the
establishment, to whose comforts he
has catered.

ANOTHER FINE WEEK IN TRADE.
TRADE conditions during the second week of the new year
were fully as promising as during the first week, which; as has
been seen, was exceptionally promising. The usual midwinter
lull is much lighter than in the ordinary year, and all sections report
a very good distribution of merchandise, except some parts of the
-South, where the depression in the cotton industry, due to the
enormous crop and recent sharp decline in prices, are having a de
terrent influence, more or less pronounced, such as harder collec
tions, with some extensions requested, etc.
The manufacturing interests are sending in very good reports
at present and many branches state that they have orders booked
for several months ahead, indicating that production has not yet
overtaken consumption. The best returns come from the iron and
steel trades, though the woolen mills are actively engaged, with
stocks of raw wool at leading centers lighter than for a good many
years, while the market for raw wool rules firm at the good prices.
New England boot and shoe factories report business excellent, and
even the cotton mills expect to do a lively business when the con
dition of the raw cotton market becomes more definitely settled. An
encouraging feature in these four important industrial lines is the
' general employment of labor at good wages and the absence of large
. and troublesome strikes. In fact, taking the country as a whole, the
labor situation is more settled than for years.
Other current returns point to continued activity in general
trade. The railroad earnings continue to show a steady increase
over corresponding periods last year. The failures last week were
324, against exactly the same number in 1904, and of these the
South contributed rather more than its usual proportion, owing to
the disturbed condition of the cotton industry, on which that half
of the country so largely depends. The bank clearings for the week
made a fine showing, the gain over 1904 being 28.2 per cent, with
only two cities âNew Orleans and St. Paulâout of the first forty
.. three on the list exhibiting a decrease from last year, and these two
losses were insignificant, being .2 and 3.4 per cent, respectively. The.
aggregate clearings were $2,905,033,000, showing, a vast volume of
general trade throughout the country. The 'only lines showing
lassitude are cotton and provisions, but the tone of the latter market
seems to be slowly improving, and there is no actual depression in it.
An excellent feature of the times is the remarkably favorable
condition of farm produce. Look wherever we will, we find stocks
in farmers' hands light, while quotations for almost everything pro
duced on the farm are above the average of the past ten or fifteen
years. This is a condition which, in itself alone, is sufficient to
guarantee another year of prosperity. The railroads. t.K>. are again
running short of cars in some sections, showing a large distributive
trade in produce and merchandise, while the excellent condition of
the crops points to a large production for the coming year, as far
as any pointing can be done so early in the season.
The Xew York stock market, which is largely governed by 'he
conditions in the industries and crops, is reflecting the favoralle
outjlook by a buoyancy and bullishness which nothing can destroy.
Even the fulminations and dire predictions of the frenzied Boston
speculator, so effective a month ago, now fall flat and cause no ap
preciable effect on the market, except to provoke a laugh and a
sneer. His last announcements fell flat. It is pretty hard, when
the country is doing a vast legitimate business, with more cash
money than it really knows what to do with and fine crop prospects
assuring another good year, to make the average citizen believe
that the country is going to the dogs, so Lawson will probably
have to give it up as a bad game.
On this coast the conditions are as fine as elsewhere in the
United States. We have sold almost all of our wheat, barley, dried
.and canned fruits, hops, beans and other leading products of the
soil. Our wool # clip has all been sold and the market is bare. The
weather from a farmer's standpoint has been ideal ever since last
September and the crops all over the coast are looking finely. Our
banks are still heavily supplied with funds, c&llections are good, the
failures are certainly not over the average, real estate and building
operations, both in city and country, are extremely active, and all
conditions indicate continued prosperity.
THE COLORADO SETTLEMENT.
THE adjustment" of the gubernatorial contest in Colorado .makes
it apparent that the raw head and bloody bones news sent
out by Senator Patterson's papers was not justified. Adams,
the Democratic, and Peabody, the Republican candidate, came to
gether and made an orderly arrangement. Governor Peabody
appointed two Republican jurists to the Supreme bench. They were
sworn in and then Mr.*s\<lams was given the right of way, took the
oath as Governor, and Peabody makes his contest before the Legis
lature. Governor Peabody shows well in the whole affair. He
stood beside Adams in the inaugural ceremonies and performed his
polite and formal part in welcoming his competitor to a seat from
which he will probably oust him by a legal contest.
Governor Peabody, like Governor Steunenberg of Idaho, had
a hard duty to perform in preventing the subversion of the state
itself by the same criminal and disorderly element. Both enforced
the law. Both purged the affected communities of an element that
murdered men and destroyed property, and was in lawless alliance
with the local officiary. In doing this, both incurred censure and
were widely misrepresented. There the analogy ceases. The Demo
cratic party of Idaho put Governor Steunenberg under the ban ana
retired him from public life for being a true American and enforcing
the law. The Republican party of Colorado renominated Governor
Peabody, indorsed his administration and fought a mighty battle
to re-elect him, and no doubt did so, as will appear when the elec
tion frauds and crimes committed to defeat him are exposed by the
Legislature.
The courts have* already jailed scores of election officers and
defilers of the ballot-box. A legislative investigation was decided
upon, because there was a tacit agreement that women voters and
election officers should not be sent to jail. Yet they falsified tally
sheets and stuffed ballot-boxes with a free hand. The Legislature
can expose the frauds of the female electors without subjecting them
to penalties for felony. There may be those who object to this,
believing that a woman who corrupts the ballot-box should take pot
luck and jail with men who do the same. But let us at least lift
our hats to the gallantry of Colorado. 1

CHICAGO UNIVERSITY
GIRL WILL TRY TO
REFORM THE POLICE
PLANS OF ONE GIRL
Reform the Chicago police
force.
Revolutionize the methods of
municipal government.
Draft a new charter for Chi
cago.
ANEW co-ed at the University of
Chicago has mapped out a stren
uous programme of reform which
will mark her advent into the
city, says the Inter Ocean. Miss Willie
Curtis is her name, and she is fresh
from an exclusive finishing school of
Beacon Hill, in Boston, with her head
full of notions which she is aching to
turn loose on the long-suffering citizens
of Chicago.
She is going to assist the "powers
that make for good" in the uplifting of
the city. She is going to frame up a
new charter for the city's government;
she is going to reverse the present City
Hall methods and move the founda
tions of Western society several inches
to the east, but most of all she is going
to reform the police force.
Dress reform, reform of manners, re
form of speech, reform of moralsâit is
all there in her busy brain, and as soon
as she can get it straightened out she
will turn it loose from the Midway in
stitution and let it spread north and
west.
Her ftrst step was to organize a de
bating team which will wage merry
war on the poor policemen and air her
views on the matter of municipal clean
liness.
Miss Curtis is also great on political
economy and has pronounced ideas
about*the new charter, but she never
wanders far from the police force, the
piece de resistance of her reform move
ment.
"The Chief of Poice should be elect
ed by tbe people, and I propose to help
bring this reform about." she said. "I
have heard, among other things, of
these poicemen cheating in examina
tions, and it ought to be stopped.
"And the new charter. Woudn't it be
lovely if we could have a hand in making
Chicago's new dress and take the re
sponsibility from poor Mayor Harri
son?"
Miss Curtis is the first woman at the
University of Chicago to gain a place
on the freshman debating team.
HOTEL FOR OHILDRBN.
\ â
England's fashionable babies are
now the proud possessors %f a hotel
of their own.
It stands in London, in Pembroke
Square, Wâ and is under the control
of the Norland Institute of Nurses. It
has been opened to provide a safe and
happy home for children whose
parents are compelled by business to
travel.
The babies' hotel has been furnished
throughout to suit the peculiar needs
of the most fastidious of its little in
mates.
There are half a dozenvsuites, each
decorated and furnished in baby style,
and consisting of a day and night nur
sery, under the charge of a trained
nurse of the Norland Institute.
The furniture in all the rooms is
lilliputian in size, says the London Ex
press. Tiny chairs and table, diminu
tive water jugs, basins and washstands
have been provided for the guests.
One suite is furnished throughout
in white enamel, others are in light
oak. They .nre known as the "Speed
well" âthe badge of the Norland
nurses â "Forget-Me-Not," "Daisy,"
"Dawn," "Peace" and "Joy" suites.
In some respects the babies' hotel
will be more exclusive than hotels for
"grown-ups." The occupants of each
suite, for instance, do not associate
with any other guests, the object be
ing to test the ability of the student
nurse to amuse her little charges with
out outside help.
Guests may be of any age from 1
month to 8 years, and they are taken
by the week, month or year. Babies
who arrive before the feeding bottle
stage is over pay from 12s to Â£2 2s a
week, according to the suite. Other
children pay from Â£38 to Â£100 per an
num.

REAL LIFE CAMILLE
IMPOSSIBLE
DOROTHY FENIMORE
SOME one has written to ask what
I think of the celebrated Lady of
the Camelias, and has requested a
reply to the specific question: "Do
you think a Camille in real life
could love as unselfishly as the heroine
of Dumas' novel?"
The theme of both the novel and
drama of this name is, as you know,
the awakening of a soul under the in
fluence of love. The idea is worked out
in a manner thoroughly French, and
this fact constitutes my answer to the
question which has been asked me. Ac
cording to the testimony of many
French writers, a Camille is possible In
the social life of France.
In America, however, the woman's
character as it is portrayed would not j
appear consistent. Public opinion in ,
regard to womanliness and genuine '
love is high among us, and we have, in I
spite of our reputation for prudery, a |
blunt fashion of calling vice by its j
right lame. You will go far in our j
civilization to find any one who believes J
in sober sincerity that a pure love can j
spring from an impure life, as a beau- j
tiful flower springs from mold.

Whose praises I'm wishful to sing.
Now let ye not pucker yer face wid a

'Tis soberest truth that we've got
A national bird in the Emerald Isle
That's aisily king o' the lot!
Ay! "national bird." He is certainly

Though others may claim him at times.
He's busiest most wid the fortunes of

Electricity as an Anaesthetic:
Dr. L.educ of the Faculte de Medecine
in Paris has found a way of utilizing
a current of electricity to produce in
sensibility in place of chloroform or
ether. After experimenting on animals
he submitted himself to the process,
and was entirely insensible for ten
minutes, and, after his experience, was
elated rather than depressed, which is
not usually the case after the use of
drugs for this purpose.
To win in this world you must have
more confidence in yourself than you
really cmnunt to.
THE TIME TO LIVE.
Mrs. TelletâMy husband died owing
nobody.
Mr. Wise (absently)â That's an aw
ful bad time to pick out to die.
Dumas makes a straight bid for the
favor of the gallery. He throws the
unselfishness of Camllle's love into high
relief by means of her tragic death.
But did Camille die of love? Was it
not passion that killed her? In Prance
the two terms are synonymous. But
in the United States we have erected
a barrier between these separate ideas.
It Is my. private opinion that an
American Camille who had the courage
to make a sacrifice of herself for the
sake of her lover's welfare would hayÂ»
the stamina to carry the affair off
better. She would not spoil it all by
dying for love. She would try, with
the new light that had come to her, to
turn her hard good ac
count.
I do not think that It is worth our
while to keep before our eyes In our lit
erature and drama a degenerate stand
ard of love. Are our palates so Jaded al
ready that we need ginger to stimulate
them? We talk enough about the sim
ple life, andâmetaphoricallyâwe kiss
upon both cheeks the apostles of plain
living who come from foreign shores to
look us over as possible literary ma
terial. *
And yet when we have our choice be
tween common and bread-and-butter
sandwiches with our afternoon tea and
sandwiches that have anchovies or pep
pers between their cov<b~s, we pick the
latter off the plate with a daintiness of
gesture that contrasts comically with
the eagerness we show in gobbling
them down.
Why not keep before us our best
standards of love and our highest es
timate of womanliness? The first use
of an education is that it puts us in
touch with the world's finest thought.
The power which women hold in our
land gives them the privilege of realiz
ing the true dignity of woman, and her
noblest relation with man.
What's the sense-of going out of your
way to walk through mud Just because
you have your rubbers on? You may
find to your sorrow that your footgear
is not as well made as it looks, that it
leaks at a seam. If you can't avoid
puddles, it is sensible, say I, to Jump
them.
"True love's the gift which God hath
given
To man alone beneath the heaven;
It is not fantasy's hot fire.
Whose wishes, soon as granted, fly;
It liveth not in fierce desire;
With dead desire it doth not die;
It is the secret sympathy,
The silver link, the silver tie,
Which heart to heart, and mind to
mind,
In body and in soul can bind."

THE CONSTITUTION
State Federation Politicians
#~
Biennial Convention Planned
The State Federation of Women's
Clubs at Los Angeles is now only two
tJiort weeks away, and to a disinter
ested observer it promises to look
somewhat as the Legislature did before
it.proclaimed a Senator.
Politics.' Well, it, does seem that
way, although the word really doesn't
look nice in print, does it?
One of the bombs that are due to ex
plode on. the floor of the convention is
an amendment to the federation's con
stitution providing for a biennial State
convention instead of the annual
gathering that now obtains. There
isn't a delegate going south but has
â¢her mind made up" upon that pointâ
and when a club delegate "makes up
her mind," now, something's going to
happen.
The reason offered for the change is
said to be a desire to make the gath
erings doubly strong by having them
occur less frequently. On the face of
it, that sounds not illogical. But there
are hosts of clubwomen hereabouts
who proclaim aloud that the State or
ganization is not old enough nor
healthy enough in the four years of its
being to be left unnourished and un
cafed for tor so long a period. "It will
die of inanition," they cry, even as
would an infant left without nourish
ment and care for a long period. And
then comes the question, "Why? Isn't
the. federation doing well on its present
annual basis, fed by the live current
of constant activity?"
Ah! good friends; herein are women
displaying their splendid aptitude for
the game of politics. Of course, the
â tory is not new. Napoleon knew, and
Boulanger knew, and Crispi knew the
political texture of some women for
politics, and played the game with
them. But America has not yet felt
the direct hand of women in its great
political games. But wait! Their tal
tnts are Quickening.
Bend low your ears and I'll let you
into a little secret. â¢ 'Tis this: Ambi
tion burns high in the bosom of a
very charming ladyâa clever woman,
uid one possessed of social as well as
iKlministrutive ability. She is one of
the logical candidates for State presi
dent and here's the rubâif she draws
the prize this year, with nothing do
ing socially or politically beyond the
State limits (which is mighty dull
fun), she will not hold the high of
fice for the biennial two years hence,
and a State president in biennial year
le a famous personage at the great na
tfcnal gathering. She's entertained
elaborately, courted and feted and re
ceived with charming distinction wher
ever a woman's club exists âand
there's one to be found at almost every
i rossroad throughout the East.
Then comes the meeting of mighty
minds in feminine caucus. The favor
ite candidate must âabsolutely must â
r< present the State at the biennial.
But if she adjures the honor this year,
Â»hat guarantee has she of receiving
the nomination next year? And then
thtre came light!
"I have it!" cried a subtle settler of
solemn seances. "I have it! Let's
make the federation meet every two
yt ars and then behold our candidate
holding office for the whole sweet
time." "Fine!" cried the rest of the
i>aucusians. "Fine! Then watch us
ii troduce the two-year amendment to
the constitution."
Well, there will be a large number
of watchers! In fact the women are
thinking of asking their good friend,
Fairfax Wheelan, to go south and help
them watch that balloting.
Meanwhile, however, that amend
ment must be gagged, bagged and
tlung into oblivion if the State federa
tion would live, say the women within
?arshot.

A terrible commotion has been stirred
up in the California Club over the sud
den somersault taken by the building
committee. Entirely new plans* by an
entirely new architect have been
drawn. The old plans and the old
architect belonging to the old admin
istration were dropped. There are
those who have offered congratula
tions to the old architect.
However, so far so good! But the
shock came when the fact was sprung
upon the club members, through the
busy body press, that the new plans
had been finished and accepted, and
that the contract for building had been
let and was on record. Here was quick

Whew! How the telephones in town
did ring that morning. And the things
they said did sound like a matin pray

tee, which was dissolved by the incom

of the club members that the plans
should have been submitted to the
club for ratification, since the club
members pay the bills. However, the

SUFFOCATED BEFORE THEY

Facts Show New York Lawyer and

Accidental Fire.
NEW YORK, Jan. 15. âIt now ap
pears that William T. Mason, the law
yer, and his family, who were the vic
tims of a fire in their home early this
morning, were in reality suffocated.
The family consisted of Mason's wife
and two children âEllen, 4 years old,
and Marion, 6 months old. A servant
also lost her life. **
Although neighbors say they heard
cries of "Murder!" and "Burglars!"
the police found nothing to indicate
that the Are was not accidental. The
whole family appears to have been
suffocated. The bodies of the father
and youngest child were untouched by
the flames. The others in the house
probably were burned after they had
died.
A policeman and a neighbor who
had heard cries attempted to break
into the house, but were driven back
by the smoke.
The chkrred bodies of Mrs. Mason,
the servant and Ellen were found in
a closet under the roof scuttle,
through which they are supposed to
have attempted to escape. The bodies
of Mason and the youngest child were
in a bedroom.

stalling officer, the grand marshal,
Henry W. Osthoff, J. W. Brooks, R. A.
Wheeler and George J. Strong.
The district deputy next installed
the officers of Spartan Lodge in South

performed in a manner that reflected
great cerdit upon the deputy and those
who assisted him. Among the promi
nent members of the order present
was Grand Secretary George T. Shaw,
who is a member of the lodge. At the
close of the lodge business there were
congratulatory addresses by the grand
secretary, the district deputy and other

cellent rendition of the Installation
work. At a banquet which followed
there were addresses by the installing
officers and the new officers.
The last of the installations in the
district was that of the officers who

SANTA CLAUS MAKES FUN
ON SHIP IN MID-OCEAN.
FESTIVAL-HELD ON THE SHERMAN
Christmas Celebrated In Home Fashion bu
Soldiers Returning From Philippines.
The transport Sherman from Manila
arrived In port at daylight yesterday
morning:. Captain Bruguiere reports
that the voyage was stormy all the
way across and, while there was no
special storm of any great violence,
winds and rains were an every day
occurrence. The Sherman left Manila
December 15. Christmas was celebrat
ed on board in grand style. This hap
pened a day out from Nagasaki. At
that port a Christmas tree was pro
cured and the ladies of the ship dec
orated it out in splendid shape. Im
mediately after dinner the whole com
pany qf cabin passengers assembled in
the big dining saloon to join in the
entertainment. There were twenty
children and all were presented with
Christmas gifts by a Jovial Santa Claus,
in the person of Lieutenant Mack K.
Cunningham, signal corps. Later in
the evening there was splendid music
by a quartet of soldiers, and after
ward ell joined In drinking "Merrf
Christmas" in bumpers of sparkling
punch. New Year's eve was also cele
brated In becoming style.
â¢To add to the general social life
of the voyage a christening took place
on board on December 18. It was the
first anniversary of the birth of the
pretty little baby daughter of Captain
F. E. Foss. The ceremony took place
on Sunday immediately after morning
service. Chaplain Oliver C. Miller of
ficiated and named the little babe
Violet Grace.
An accidental shooting 'affair also
served to enliven up the trip. Two en
listed men were discussing the merits
of a carbine in a friendly manner,
when the gun was dropped to the deck,
with the result that John Sylvester was
shot through the calf of the leg.
Only one stowaway was found. He
managed to get on board at Honolulu.
Albert d'Arcy, a former employe of
the customs service at Manila, died
the second day out from that port. The
Sherman will be unloaded and reload
ed with all possible dispatch, as she
will sail on her return trip to Manila
on February 1.
She was thirty days and five hours
from Manila, twenty-two days from
Nagasaki, and seven days and fifteen
hours from Honolulu.
Captain Bruguiere reports that the
big boiler that she carried over on her
outgoing trip for the naval tug Wom
patuck was safely landed at Cavite. It
weighed forty-Aye tons. In order to
hoist it from the rrajd of the Sherman
it was necessary to shore up the decks.
There was only half an inch leaway be
tween the boiler and the hatchway.

Elder Has Terrible Trip.
The steamship George W. Elder had a tough
experience coming- down the coast from
Astoria which delayed her twenty-four hours
In reaching Bort. The Columbia River bar was
smooth when she passed out. but she had only
touched her nose into the deep when she ran
Into a heavy sea and a strong head wind.
The hurricane she ran into Just before Christ
mas, on her down trip, was practically a
summeq sea compared with the terrible storm
she encountered on this voyage. The gale was
a furious one. The seas swept her decks from
stem to stern. At times the main deck was
flooded with water a foot deep. When a little
above Cape Blanco the storm raged so furiously
that the vessel was hove to for several hours,
apd twice she was obliged to slow down. Great
mountains of water constantly poured over
her and swashed down through her ventilators.
She was sixty-six and one-half hours making
the trip, Whereas her usual time is about
forty-eight houra
Anemone Is a Success.
The trial trip of W. T. White's new launch
Anemone took place yesterday. She Is a smart
little boat and will be a great acquisition to
the craft of the bay. She Is handsomely and
luxuriously furnished and finished. Her outside
woodwork Is of teak, while her cabins are of
rich mahogany. She is 41 feet long, 8 foot
beam and her draught is 3 feet 4 inches. She
Is fitted with a standard gas engine of twenty
five horsepower and Is lighted by electricity.
In appearance she is what is known as a tor
pedo style boat. She was built by J. C.
Beetle.

beat again this year for the Water
house cup at two and a quarter miles,

mHes. Claude is entered in the latter
event, and many think it would be a
Cakewalk for Mike Daly's horse. Major
Mansir, which captured the four-mile
stak- at New Orleans two seasons'
ago, will also receive a special "prep"
for .the two long distance numbers.
W. Davis continues to do.good, con

speckled and uncertain.

Match Is Postponed.
The Independents beat the Albion
Rovers by a score of two goals to one
in a match for the championship of
the California Association Football

â¢narrow margin of one goal to nothing.
The match at Idora Park, Oakland, be

RAINY WEATHER PREVENTS
INTERNATIONAL POLO GAME
Practice Contest Is Substituted and
Reds Win by a Score
of G to 2.
SAN MATEO, Jan. 15.âOwing to
bad weather the international polo
game was postponed to-day and a
match of mixed sides played instead.
The Reds were winners by a score of
6. to 2. Those wearing the crimson
colors were Sir George Prescott, Cyril
B. Tobin, R. M. Tobin and Captain de
Crespigny, the first and last named be
ing of the Hurlingham team. The
Whites were Francis J. Carolan, F. C.
G. Menzies, John Lawsoh and Walter
S. Hobart. The umpires were .J. O.
Tobin Jr. and Lawrence McCreery.
The match was played on the field of
C. W. Clark and the rain made the
ground too soft for any certainty of
skill. The two Englishmen playing
with the Reds did exceptionally good
wcrk and gave better promise of an
even match in the international games
than their three practice games here
have indicated. Dates of future games
will depend on the Weather.
. Nothing makes the woman who
woks more angry than to have her
kufband praise the appearance of the
W'jman next door, who is an idler.

C. Hildreth, the well known turfman,
is in serious trouble here as the result
of the mysterious shooting of a man
by the name of John Moses at a resort.
Hildreth is now under arrest, charged
with shooting and wounding Moses, but
claims that he is noa> guilty. Neither
of the men will discuss the affair.
The bullet grazed Moses' head and
he was unconscious for several hours,
but wiH recover. The women in the
resort, who are the only ones that have
given the police any information, say
that Hildreth made a bet with Moses
that he could shoot off the tetter's hat
without hurting him. That he lost his
bet is evident.

is no city In California which has bet
ter surroundings for such an event
than this place, and Secretary Adams
is doing all in his power to boom the
project.

merly Miss Zimmerman of Cincinnati,
is spending large sums of her pet dogs,
and now has taken up the fad of

THE" SAN FRANCISCO GALJL, MONDAY. JANUARY 16, 1905.
BOYS IN BLUE
REVEL IN MUD
Fort Miley Beats Cardinal
B on Checker Board That
Is the Limit for Slush
Twenty-two game young men, repre
senting the Cardinal B eleven of the
League of the Cross Cadets and the
Fort Miley team from the Presidio,
skirmished around in the mud at the
Presidio grounds yesterday afternoon
in fearless style." The soldiers proved
the better "mudders" and got away
with the game by a score of 10 to 0.
The field was absolutely the ltmit.
The players practiced eating chunks of
slush before they got into the game and
then they swallowed more. Fast work
and scientific play was out of the ques
tion. Several times a chunk of adobe
was mistaken for the ball and the ref
eree had a hard time straightening out
the tangles that resulted from these
blunders.
.The first half went along without
incident. Some of the players called
for bathing suits, while others insisted
on boats. As neither were to be had,
the kickers suffered noticeably. Fum
bles of all kinds and descriptions were
made and repeated. Fort Mlley was
the stronger in bucking the line, but
the cadets held their own.
Cardinal B's men were all in when
the second half had gone but a short
distance. The soldiers forced the ball
to B's twenty yard line and then lost it
on a fumble. The Cadets were forced
to kick, but when the ball was snapped
to Coffey he fumbled and allowed the
pig skin to pass him and go through
to the goal. One of his team mates
rushed it to the five yard line where it
was given to Fort Miley. A touchdown
for the soldiers resulted a moment
later.
From that time on the boys in blue
go* Into the game. They managed to
buck the line hard to score another
touchdown a short time before the
game came to an end. Pento, the full
back, tried to kick goal twice, but
failed because his feet were too heavy
to lift. The teams lined up as follows:
Fort Miley. â¢ Poeiton. Carllnal B

HUNTERS REFUSE TO KILL
DUCKS THAT ARE HELPLESS
Sportsmen Will Desert Richardson's
Bay Because They Don't Enjoy
Shooting Oil-Soaked Fowl.
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 15.âThe hunt
ers who for years past have made
Richardson's Bay their retreat during
the duck season have practically aban
doned that place and- will search for
new quarters. The cause of their sud
den departure is attributed to the oily
condition of the water in the upper
bay, which has the ducks,
preventing them from flying. The
birds, mostly canvasbacks, have found
a retreat on the marshes, but are prac
tically helpless. The late southwest
winds have caused the oil which is dis
charged in the bay near Point Rich
mond to float into Richardson's Bay
instead of finding an outlet to the
ocean.
The shores of the bay were lined
with men and boys to-day and they
had no difficulty in bagging the help
less birds. Many Sausalito hunters,
who shoot for sport, have decided to
look for new quarters at once. They
say the ducks have not a chance and
as they are real sportsmen they pre
fer to look for a pond where the ducks
will get an even break. The birds not
covered with oil have gone In search
of new homes and they will probably
not return to Richardson's Bay for
many moons. The oil-covered birds,
helpless to search for food, will perish
In a few days.

Heat Food Without Fire.
In the recent news many people
h&vjs noticed one of two references
to the fact that tinned meats for the
Russian troops are prepared by a pro
cess which enables the contents of
each tin to be served hot without a
fire. This boon is obtained by having
the ordinary tins filled with food
"jacketed" In patent tins. The patent
tin contains water, together with a
chemical mixture by means of which
the water can be raised to* boiling
point in ten minutes or a quarter of
an hour. All that is necessary to do
when it is desired to heat the focd
is to puncture the top of the patent
tin, the chemical mixture being there
by forced into the water, which soon
begins to boll. âLondon Mail.
Cutting Off Boys From Tobacco.
The Spanish Cortes is about to be
come the scene of a remarkable ex
periment in social legislation. The Min
ister of the Interior has drafted a bill
absolutely prohibiting the selling of to
bacco, cigars or cigarettes to any per
son under 17 years of age. The penal
ties vary from Â£2 to Â£20, -with Im
prisonment in exceptionally bad cases.
The measure is justified as Imperative
for the arrest of racial degeneration.
Tuberculosis makes great ravages
among Spanish laboring youths, who,
for the most part, undernourished and
already enfeebled by this and over
work, aggravate matters by spending
much of their scanty wages in tobacco,
generally cigarettes.âLondon Globe v

AGES OF GREAT MEN
IN VARIOUS FIELDS
In Each Sphere Some of the Most
Famous Have Died
Early.
A great man does not always attain
a ripe old age; in fact, hardly half of
the greatest men of ancient and mod
ern times have reached the limit of asre
set by the Bible, seventy. Among
statesmen, Mirabeau was 42. Pitt 47.
Cromwell 59, Caesar 66, Richelieu 57.
Washington 67, Charlemagne 71. Fred
erick the Great "74, Disraeli 75. Augus
tus 76, Bismarck 83, Talleyrand 84.
Of the great conquerors, Alexander
the Great died at 32, Napoleon at 51.
Hannibal at 63, Themistocles at 65. Ma
rius at 71, Marlborough at 72. Tilley at
72, Blucher at 76, Bernadotte at 80.
Wellington at 83, Xenophon at 86.
Moltke at 91.
The age of the deceased philosophers
was: Spinoza 44? Descartes 53, Hesrel
61, Aristotle 62, Socrates 68. Liebnitz 77,
Linnaeus 70, Copernicus 70. Galileo 78.
Kant 79, Plato 82, Newton 84. Hum
boldt 80.
The longevity of great writers and
poets is as follows: Byron 36. Schiller
45, Moliere 61, Virgil 51. Shakespeare
62, Dante 56, Dickens 57, Horace 57. Ra
cine 59, Scott 61, Milton 65. Cervantes

New Kind of Potato.
A new species of white potato is be
ing cultivated In France from a pe
culiar variety found in Uruguay. It is
believed that it is destined to replace
even the Irish potato. Originally a
very bitter tuber, the new vegetable
becomes, after three or four years of
cultivation, an admirable food product.
Its yield Is enormous and it is exempt
from maladies that attack the ordinary
potato. It grows best in moist soil, its
native habitat being the marshy shores
of the river Mercedes, in Uruguay. Its
flowers have a jasmine-like odor and
a delicate perfume has already been
extracted from them. After one plant
ing the species perpetuates itself from
the broken roots left in the ground.â
London Globe.
Had to Humor Customers.
It is not only cigars that vary in
name without varying in quality. The
present writer was once told when
hesitating between "fresh eggs" at
ten a shilling, and "good breakfast
eggs" at eight a shilling, or something
to that effect, that these two brands
were precisely the same, but had to be
sold as two qualities because no custom
ers would buy eggs at a shop where only
one quality was advertised. That may
or may not be so. The fact remains
that there are many qualities of eggs
known to all housewives before we
get down to what a late comedian
termed briefly "eggs."âLondon Chroni

NO MORE HARES
FOR THE DOGS
Famine of Jacks Prevents
Two Stakes From Being
Completed at Ingleside
LARGE CROWD PRESENT
Trials Furnish Some Good
Sport and Wagering Is
Lively Throughout the Day
Ingleside Coursing Park reopened
yesterday after being closed for several
weeks. Two stakes were on the pro
gramme, but they were left unfin
ished on account of a shortage of
hares, though it is hardly like*ly any
mere courses would have been run as
darkness was setting in. Haphazard,
Sacramento Boy and Reckless Acrobat
were left in the reserve stake and they
will contest for final honors next Sun
day. Quita, Carlow Boy and Rocked
Asleep were the dogs left in the class
event. Quita will meet either of the
former two dogs, as she has run her
course in the third round.
Though the day was not pleasant a
large crowd was in attendance. The
betting was unusually brisk. Short
ends scored frequently during the first
round of the reserve event, but during
the afternoon the favorite layers had
things their own way. The few out
siders that scored were held at small
odds.
Old Sacramento *3oy still possesses
the speed and working ability to de
feat the best of them. From the way
ho ran yesterday he will add a few
more brackets to his credit before go
ing into retirement. Carlow Boy
showed the most speed in the cham
pion event and will probably get first
money next Sunday. Following are

Wonders of Telegraphone.
Dr. Z. B. Babbitt of New York, lec
tured before the Franklin Institute last
night upon the telegrapnone, an ap
paratus invented by Valdemar Paul
son of Copenhagen, by which the
human voice is recorded and stored on
a wire or metal disc without indenta
tion or mark of any kind, and may sub
sequently be reproduced audibly
through the telephone. The machine,
as explained by Dr. Babbitt, has the
ability to perform Aye different func
tions, as follows: Receives dictation,
reproduces to the dictator, reproduces
to one at a distant point, the machine
being under control at that point, and
records conversations between two
persons over the telephone lines with
out in any way interfering with the
operation of those lines.
It also records automatically, in the
absence of the subscriber from the
office, messages coming over "the line
during such absence, the machine
being under absolute automatic con
trol, the ringing of the bell starting
the machine, which sends a signal over
the line to the person talking, notifying
him that it is running.âPhiladelphia

Business in Butte.
Not one of the 13,000 miners of Butte
earns less than $3.50 a day, and they all
spend their money like prodigal sons.
In the old open gambling days, not long
gone by, drill-drivers wearing flannel
shirts have bet stacks of silver and
gold slugs with the recklessness of
royal rakes at Monte Carlo.
The people are all plungers. Two
men came up to a cigar case. "Let's
shake the box," said one.
As they lit their cigars the other
asked:
"How much do you want for that
mine, anyway?"
"Thirty-five thousand," was the an
swer.
"Give you 25," said the other.
"Won't take 25," replied his friend,
"but I'll just shake dice whether you
give me 25,000 or 50."
"All right. First flop or horses?"
"First flop," came back the answer.
They each rolled the dice out only
once. The man who lost wrote his
check for $50,000 with a lead pencil.â

Leading the Simple Life.
One of the season's buds has just had
a simple little party at which there
was an informal dance and supper,
after which a cotillon and another sup
per. Next week in her honor there
will be another unpretentious enter
tainment, consisting of a private theat
rical per for mar.cc by a famous French
actjlâ¬as, to be followed by a plain little
supper by one of the most exclusive
caterers, then a cotillon and another
frugal supper of several courses about
daylight. And still scoffers will deny
the influence of "The Simple Life."â

How to Banish Fog.
The fact is incontrovertible that the
dismal fogs, which do so much to make
London a city of Dis at this season
of the year, are perfectly controllable
phenomena. They could be banished
by our taking thoughtâthat is, by for
bidding factories and the like to emit
black smoke and by inducing the or
dinary householder to adopt smoke
consuming grates. Yet In spite of all
that they suffer, the London public are
content to leave agitation for reform
entirely in the hands of a small so
ciety.âBlack and White.

More Than $5000 Changes
Hands When Francis J.
Carolan's Racer Is Beaten
Special Dispatch to Tbo Call.
SAN MATEO, Jan. 15.âAbout $600t
changed hands here to-day on a run
ning race between the favorite ponies
Marigold, owned by Walter S. Hobart.
and Francis J. Carolan's Peggy Wil
liams, in an exciting match that was
run on Carolan's private track at
Crossways farm at noon. Marigold
won easily from Peggy Williams. The
purse was $1000, put up by the owners.
Many side bets were made by specta
tors.
The distance run was one-quarter of
a mile and Marigold went the rout* in
24 seconds, beating the best pony rec
ord on the San Mateo tracks and prob
ably the State by at least one second.
Peggy Yvilliams was sired by Ho
bart's Silver Dick, out of Fanny Wil
liams, who won against Spreckels'
favorite, Becky, In the races on Janu
ary 7. Carolan rode the winner in that
match and became so attached to the
ponies that he purchased both for
$2000, so it is said, on condition that
Peggy beat any pony in San Mateo.
Otherwise L>. C. Williams, the owner,
was to accept two-thirds of that valu
ation, and it is said that he also shared
equally with Carolan the $1000 bet to
day.
Williams' son, a boy of about 16
years, rode Peggy, while the veteran
Kelly piloted Marigold.
Peggy acted badly before the start
and was somewhat exhausted, - "Ho
barfs luck" with other things stayed
by to give him the race by more than
four lengths. Hobart and Carolan
were the judges, while Paul Clagstono
started. Many society people wit
nessed the match, which was run in a
heavy shower.
The Artificial Diamond.
The reward of the inventor who can
produce artificial diamonds is so
tempting that the Moisson experiments
with the electric furnace, which were
inaugurated some eight or ten years
ago, have been continued until the
present day. They are now being car
ried on in the laboratory of the Sor
bonne, in Paris, with an ever-increas
ing success. The first diamonds made
by the electric furnace were of mi
croscopic size and few in number. In
fact, they were so minute and uncom
mon that it took a great deal of re
peated experimenting to secure
enough specimens to demonstrate be
yond a doubt that the brilliant crys
tals were actual diamonds. As the
work continued various modifications
were worked out, as the experience of
the investigators became greater, un
til now success seems imminent. The
crystals are positively known to par
take of all the characteristics of the
diamond in crystalline structure, hard
ness and chemical composition, as
demonstrated by combustion experi
ments. The largest crystal yet ob
tained is only one-half a millimeter
in length, and while this is only a
spark, it indicates that the process is
capable of yielding diamonds of good
quality, and that some day in the not
distant future the laboratory pro
cesses of Mother Nature, as exempli
fied in the Rand, may be duplicated in
man's laboratory and in a commercial
way.âNew York Times.
Birth of the Moon.
Year by year the moon is getting a
few inches more distant, and reversing
the argument, year by year in the great
past the moon was nearer to us. Pro
fessor George Darwin has shown that
long, long ago the moon revolved close
to the earth, and still earlier formed
part of this globe. From that time to
the present he calculates that at least
54,000,000 years must have elapsed. The
birth of the moon took place, therefore,
somewhere about that date in the past.
Sir Robert Ball observed that when
the moon was near to us its attraction,
must have produced enormous tides,
many times greater than those that
wash our shores to-day, and he sug
gested that these tides, by their power
ful erosions and wasting of the land,
accelerated the geological forces and
so reduced the tremendous periods
which the geologists have demanded.â
London Telegraph.
Inspectors Who Do Not Inspect.
The burning of another New York
steamboat a few days ago developed
the fact that, notwithstanding all the
vigor of Inspection after the event
manifested following the Sloeum dis
aster, the burned boat and a sister ves
sel had "escaped" the general re inspec
tion ordered by Secretary Cortelyou
some months ago. The frequency with
which vessels that "escape" Inspection
burn up seems to convey no lesson to
those responsible. If there is one branch
of the public service above others
which should be trustworthy it is that
having charge of the protection of life.
Yet experience has shown it to be par
ticularly lax. It is time it was mads
plain that profuseness of promise after
a disaster will not be taken as an ex
cuse for lack of performance in pro
venting the accidents.âPitsburg Dis

FUGITIVE SAFE
BEHIND BARS
A. A. Kratz Is Brought From
Mexico by Detective T. B.
Gibson and Lodged in Jail
HIS BONDS FORFEITED
Asserts It Is Nobody's Busi
ness Why He Was Report
ed Drowned at Long Beach
A. A. Kratz is safe behind the bars at j
the City Prison. Detective T. B. Gibson
arrived from Mexico with his prisoner
yesterday morning. Kratz wore an
"Oregon boot" to prevent him from
making a break for liberty. Gibson
looked haggard and careworn, owing to
anxiety about his prisoner and the poor
accommodation and food provided for
him during the time he was waiting
the slow process of the law regarding
Kratz's extradition. Gibson left here
on October 28 and took his departure
from Cananea, Mexico, last Friday.
During the trip from Mexico Kratz
was so ill that a physician had to be
piocured to prescribe for him. Kratz
denies that he attempted to escape
from jail at Cananea, but Gibson says
he did and that was why an "Oregon
boot" was demanded. Regarding his
reported drowning at Long Beach last
September, Kratz says it is nobody's
business. He professes to be anxious
for his trial and says he has nothing
to fear.
Kratz's brother, William, was vice
president of the Dinandt-Kratz Com
pany, commission merchants, and in
February last William collected over
$16,000 and tied with the money. He
was arrested in Kansas City, where he
Was living under an assumed name.
He was tried in Judge Dunne's court
for felony embezzlement, convicted and
sentenced to serve five years in San
Quentin. The case is on appeal to the
Supreme Court.
A. A. Kratz was. also arrested for
felony embezzlement as he was with
his brother at the time of the disap
pearance. While waiting trial in Judge
Dunne's court it was reported that he
had been drowned at Long Beach. The
report was not believed, and Judge
Dunne forfeited his bonds of $10,000 and
issued a bench warrant "or his arrest.
He was arrested in Cananea, Mexico,
on October 27. His sureties were his
father, sister and Attorney H. D New
house. The case is on Judge Dunne's
calendar for Saturday.

HISTORY OF CHURCH
ELOQUENTLY RECITED
Bishop Garveu of Pennsylvania
Speaks at St, Patrick's.
BISHOP OF ALTOONA. PA.. WHO YESTERDAY MORNING PREACHED AN ELO
QUENT SERMON ON CHURCH HISTORY BEFORE THE HOLY NAME SODAL
ITY OF ST. PATRICK'S CHURCH AT ITS PATRONAL FEAST.
The Holy Name Sodality of St. Pat
rick's Church celebrated its patronal
feast of the Holy Name of Jesus yester
day morning with special services at
the 7:30 o'clock mass. At 11 o'clock
mass Bishop E. A. Garvey of Altooha.
Pa., who arrived in the city last week
to see his sister. Sister Eugenia, prin
cipal of St. Vincent's School, who has
been seriously 111, preached the ser
mon.
In giving a review of the church's
history Bishop Garvey said:
The thirteenth century was the golden age of
the church's life At that period national bar
rier* had been broken down to a great extent
by the Crusades. Great faith in Â«'hrist and
loyalty to his church were supreme In the
hearts of men.
Celebrated religious orders like the Fran
ciscans and Dominicans were organized to â¢â¢any
the seeds of the gospel to the ends cf the earth,
and great saints arose In every walk of life.
Celebrated universities which still flourish,
but, alas! perverted "from their original pur
pose, were then established. In their halls
genius like St. Thomas Aquinas. Albert us
Magnus and Duns Scotus. lectured to admiring
thousands on the divine side of theology, and
powerful kings were obliged to obey great pon
tiff* like Innocent 111 recalling them to a sense
of duty and reminding them that kings as well
as the meanest of the.lr subjects must render
themselves amenable to the divine law.
In referring to "the struggles of the
church in past ages to- preserve her
God-given right of appointing Bishops
to vacant sees" Bishop Garvey con
tinued:
If she has been hampered by the civil power
can she fairly be held responsible for the evils
which resulted from auch unjust aggression'

INSANE PATIENT TRIES TO ESCAPE.â
Paul Angelina, an lnaane patient at the de

tal, broke through the door of hie cell last

King or his ministers will prove subservient
tools.cf the state, and, at least tolerate, and
unworthy priesthood meant the decay of faith
and charity In th>- hearts of the people.
This will explain much of the success which
attended . that irroat revolt against the church
in the sixteenth century. The evil was checked
for at least 150 yearn- by the great Council cf
Trent, only to break out afresh in the eight
eenth and nineteenth crtituries. when all the
iorces nf worldlings and unbelief were mar
shaled against the church of Jesus Christ and
his dear. As <"hrlÂ«t was led* from the trib
unal of Pilate to that cf Hsrod, so also hit.
church has been hound ana gagged not only
by princes, but by peoples: not only by king
doms and empires, but by republics.
Y<>Â« may sr-k If this is not a sign of ap
proaching dissolution. Rut whatever the signs
may be. we know that she Is destined to last
till the end.
We may fe'l discouraged nt feeing her de
prived of her liberty, .as the apostles were
discouraged at seeing their divine master help
less In the hands of his enemies.
But there is no reason ror discouragement,
if we remember that her earthly existence
must be the counterpart cf this. The glory
of Mount Tabor was followed by the agony
In the garden. The Ignominy and shame of
<?ood Friday gave place to the Joys of Easter
Sunday. Sc also the church must have her
trials as wan as her triumphs, but that she
will be ultimately overcome rfiy these trials
and forced to abandon the field this we cannot
believe without believing that Christianity
was frcm tb-i beginning a delusion and a snare.
Like the cloud which led the Isreallte through
thÂ« wilderness, fhe has her bright as well as
her dark side She has the promise of her di
vine master that the gates of hell shall net pre
vail against h>;r; she hau 1 tr glorious history
of nineteen hundred years to encourage the be
lief that Christ will be with her till the end, as
he promised.
She has an organism which even from a
human standpoint would enable her to fight
a desperate battle and survive, if not victori
ous, at least uneonquered.
LEGAL FIGHT FOR CUSTODY
OF CORPSE IS AVERTED
Two Women â  Relatives of William
Glennon Demand His Body, but
One Finally Gives Way.
A lawsuit for possession of the body
of William Glennon. the aged miser of
Twentieth' and Noe streets, who
dropped dead at Ninth and Market
streets on Saturday night, was a pos
sibility Â£>r some hours yesterday, and
the Morgue officials were puzzled to
know what to do.
The body was demanded by Mrs.

is a niece of Glennon's second wife,
and by Mrs. Charles Steinbrlng, 145

BERLENDI IS POPULAR

Fair to Make Her an Idol
With the Patrons of Opera
If there is one opera more than an- i
other of which San Francisco thinks !
it knows things it is "Cavalleria Rusti- i
cana," that we had direct from Mas- ,
cagni himself. Everybody was at the \
Tivoli last night to hear Pollacco's j
version, in spite of a rainstorm much
heavier than Mr. Rossini's in the third i
act of "The Barber." Signor Pollacco
has some claims to a knowledge of
Mascagni. He conducted the premiere
of "Ratcliff" in Milan in such fashion
as to win the august approval of its
maker. The "Cavalleria" is, further, a
favorite work with (the conductor, to
whom Mascagni is the most original
and prominent figure in the modern
Italian school.
At the outset one notes throughout
slightly quicker tempi than Mascagni's
own; some cuts here and there âfrom
the composer we had the opera in its
entiretyâand certain differences of
light and shade. One remembers, for
example, the scene after the rise of
the curtain, a picture of the dawn,
given in veiled, mysterious fashion by
the composerâas ominous of the day
to follow. Mr. Pollacco's dawn is a
forthright, sunny affair âprobably all
down in the score. Mr. Mascagni did
not have to bother about scores. But
Mascagni would have been happy in
the interpretation as a whole. It was
a reading admirably dramatic and
spirited and notably sensitive and the
musicians were excellently In hand for ,
the performance.
The orchestra in both the "Cay- ;
alleria" and "I'Pagliacci" was in par
ticularly fine fettle and the .conductor
altogether newly discovered as a leader
of large resource and admirable mu
sicianship.
Berlendi was the Santuzza, with her
dimpled face surrounded by all sorts
of competitive shades âchiefly that of
the flaming-eyed Santuzza of Calve.
Tc say that Berlendi's comes next to
that astounding creation is not light
praise. In local annals that is, however,
its place. It was a Berlendi night last
night. The singer grows on acquaint
ance arid bids fair to become the favor
ite here that Mexico acclaims her. Her .
Santuzza was vividly dramatic, with a
note of convincing sincerity. It was
full of the peasant feeling, from the
simplicity of the dress to the least ges- j
ture. Slgnorina Berlendi was unfor- |
tunate in her Mamma Lucia âthey cvi- |
denUy thought so on the programme,
as they omitted to mention her name.
It might have been the toothache that
Santuzza was bewailing instead of
the perfidy of Turiddu from the
Mamma Lucia's face. Berlendi sang
at her bravely and brilliantly, and so
all through.
Colli, the last of the tenors, made
his debut last night. Last but not least, j
Signor Colli seems a little to believe ;
his Turiddu an anxious, busy, import- j
ant person. He seemed very pleased
With his receptionâgot up after he died
to acknowledge the applause. But
Signor Colli does not obliterate Agos
tinl's memory. He pleases, however,
sings well, in a high, bright voice, and
looks well. Romboli was the Alflo and
sufficed and Miss Eugenic Barker of
the Tivoli forces was a vocally pleasing
Lola, short, however, on the deviltry of
the part.
"I'Pagliacci," as usual, followed, I
with an excellent performance. Ber- ]
lendl added to her laurels as Nedda,
the coquetry of the character receiv- i
ing delightful exposition at her hands, ;
her vocal assumption perhaps the best \
in local history. Frosini has-a tremen
dOUS voice. He was the Canio of the
cast and eloquent and convincing j
from all sides. He has a bad habit of
depending on the prompter, who is, in- ,
deed, a too-busy person all round, j
Signor Romboli was the Tonio, and a
capital one. He sang his prologue in
such fashion as to capture a tumultu
ous encore, and repeated it. Our old
friend Signor Cortesi sang part j
of Silvio, and. as always, competently, j
He substituted for Signor Rossi.

The Orpheum last night varied its I
programme for the week by introducing
a new sketch by Cressy entitled "The:
New Depot." Cressy and Blanche
Dayne were recipients of the usual
praises for their work, and Cressy in
particular for his genius for adapta- !
tion. Fitzgerald Introduced a new act, I
"The Mississippi Mall," which gave him
ample opportunity to show his wonder
ful quick-change work. He represented
seven distinct characters and did jus
tice to all. Chasslno repeated his work
of last week and was well received.
Eleanor Falke, with the assistance of
the orchestra, caught the house, at
least a fair proportion of it, and Clif
ford and Burke were really clever as
eccentric comedians. Clifford sings "1
May Be Crazy, But I Ain't No Fool"
almost as weil as Williams, and was
encored several times. Burke is a good
dancer and won his share of applause.
"The Ten Nelsons" deserve the reputa
tion of being "the greatest acrobatic
family before the public." for their
number at least gives them an advan
tage which some exceedingly well ex- 1
ecuted work subjected to the test of
comparison would not award them. But
It must be said that the Nelsons are
hard to duplicate and that they are de
serving of the liberal recognition that
the great audience accorded them.

production at the California Theater
last night it could not have been re
ceived with heartier welcome. Joseph
Murphy, the neat, clever, witty Irish
comedian, likewise came in for a recep
tion which proved that even in these
days folks do love a truly brilliant
actor, though he has been before them
for ever so many years.
So genteel and nimble and agile was
the comedian that the part of Dan
O'Hara showed up as youthful as
though Murphy were in his teens. In
the love scenes, in pathos, and In num
erous moments the actor developed his
consumate art and the audience was
quirk to reward him with evidences of
its appreciation.
Murphy's company is capable. Each
can do something that is interesting,
and among these clever people Miss
Mary Fermier merits the highest com
mendation for her capable presentation
of the sweet Irish character, Nora
Drew. Miss Annie Mabel O'Brien's Lit
tle Jack the jockey, was prominent
and a bright song and dance won for
her an imperative encore.

A large audience gathered at the Al
hambra yesterday afternoon to wear
and take leave of Gadskl, who gave
her final recital of tills season. The
programme was thoroughly varied and
characteristic, ranging from Mozartâ
with two delicious examples, "Das
Veilchen" and "Schlaf mem Prinz
chen"âto Wagner, with songs by
Franz, Schumann, Schubert, Jensen,
Brahms, Bohm. Taubert, Strauss, and
a Verdi aria from "Aida." The singer
was in excellent form and was ap
plauded to the echo. After the Wag
ner group, that cpnsisted of "Dich
Teme Halle," "Gebet der Elisabeth"
and the "Llebestod" from "Tristan
and Isolde," the singer gave as en
core the "Cry of the Walkyries,
arousing a tumult of enthusiasm. The
Gadski season has been one of the>
most successful of the song recital
seasons and the singer will be most
heartily welcomed if she ever returns
to us. ...
"The Silver Slipper," the musical
burlesque by Leslie Stuart and Owen
Hail, began a two weeks' engagement
yesterday at the Grand Opera House
to two large audiences. The-spectacle
is beautifully staged, the handsome
women are elegantly gowned, and the
speaking parts of the fairly entertain
ing plot are given to care of excellent
players.
The principal and character comedy
part of the play is taken by Snltz Ed
wards, whose ability in this line is well
known. He is indescribably funny In
looks, words and gestures as Henny
Hencks, the showman, and was
heartily welcomed at his every appear
ance.
Wrenne, played by Beatrice Golden,
is a winning part played by a winning
actress, her singing of several "moon
shine" songs being artistically done.
Lora Lieb is attractive as Stella and
makes the most of a poor part.
The work of the chorus In soecial
dances and ensembles was fine, and the
rendering of the "champagne dance"
Is probably the finest ever given in San
Francisco.
Daughters of St. George.
The members of Empress Victoria
Lodge of the Daughters of St- George
have selected a committee to arrange
for an apron and neck tie party and
dance to be given in its lodge room in
the Red Men's building on the evening
