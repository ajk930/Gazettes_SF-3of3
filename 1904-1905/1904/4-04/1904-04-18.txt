of the University of Wisconsin' have
discovered a method' of making pure
iron at small cost." Under the new dis
covery, which is the result of; three
years of. research work, the product
can be made for a fraction of a cent
per pound. -The process is '. similar to
that used in refining copper, an elec

from a Opiate and depositing .it in a
pure state upon another plate..
The pure iron has valuable proper
ties not possessed by ordinary Iron, or
steel. On account- of ; its electrical
properties it is a valuable, material for
constructing electrical apparatus and
it furnishes means for making special

..VIENNA, April .17.â It is reported
from Budapest that negotiations are
proceeding between prominent Hun

American line looking to the organi

company -in Hungary. â¢ The purpose of
the negotiations is that the new com
pany, - aided by the Hamburg-Amer

line for the American emigrant traffic.

CHICAGO. April 17. â Another in
structor has departed from the Uni
versity of Chicago faculty. Cause for
this case is said not to be any dis
tasteful teachings, but a' romance
which university authorities were
anxious to check. Miss Lisl Cipriani,
teacher of Italian literature, who at
the last convocation was promoted to
an instructorship, has been given
two years' leave of absence on full
pay. Professor John Matthews
Manly, head of department of English,
has been allowed six months' vacation.
Behind these apparently simple
facts is a story of the engagement of
Miss Cipriani and Professor Manly.
It is said that promotion and , con
tinuation of full salary during her
absence were- granted on condition
that Miss Cipriani never return, as au
thorities do not look with' favor on
her engagement and expected wedding
to the English-professor.

Nicholas T. Kravtchenko, the Asso

at Port Arthur, thus showing he did
not go down with the battleship Pe
tiopavlovsk, as has been reported.
LONDON. April 18.â The correspond
ent of the Times, on board the steamer
Haimun, sent by wireless telegraph a
description confirming Vice Admiral
Togo's report of the Port Arthur opera
tions. He says that when the Russian
fleet had been enticed fifteen miles out
side the harbor Vice Admiral Togo was
notified. By a piece of bad^ luck the
wind at this' moment freshened and
d'epelled the mist and enabled Admiral
Makaroff to guess the ruse and retire
at full speed for Port Arthur. It was
a magnificent spectacle, but the Rus
sians had not been enticed sufficiently
far from the harbor. At the close of a
three days* engagement on April 15,
the whole Japanese force returned to
the main rendez vou*.
It Is said that the Japanese torpedo
flotilla attack on Port Arthur April 13
was intended to cover a landing from
nine" transports at Shwangtaitse, twen
ty miles southwest of Takushan, with a
view to cutting off the retreat of the
Port Arthur troops to Siuyen and Kai
ping. destroying the railway and pre
venting the troons stationed in South
ern Liaotung from effecting a Junction
with the main Russian forces concen
trated at Liaoyang and Mukden. The
execution of this operation only failed
owing to the fact that all places on the
peninsula suitable for the landing of
troops are protected by mines and are
Well fortified and strongly guarded.
II. Suverine. manager of the Novoe
Vremya. says he has seen a letter dated
March 1,9 frnrn Dr. Volkovltch. who was
drowned on the Petropavlovsk, in
which It is alleged that Vice Admiral
Makaroff and his staff declared that
the Japanese were using submarine
boats and that Port Arthur was not
defended by Russian mines.
A letter from Vladivostok dated
March 27 has been received here,
which says that nobody there believes
that the land operations will be begun
soon. The winter has been especially
cold and there is still much snow.
i-"ince the first bombardment the city
has been tranquil. The cOal mines
are supplying fuel to the railroad and
the city, but this is the only industry
that is being pursued.

ST. PETERSBURG. April 17. â A
dispatch from Port Arthur says sev
eral eye witnesses assert that a Jap
anese cruiser was lost outside Port

own floating mines.
According to the reports of spies.
the Japanese troops in Korea have

â¢Humors were In circulation here to
day of a fresh engagement on the Yalu
River, which had resulted favorably, to
the Russians, but a dispatch received
by the general staff to-night eays that
the situation is unchanged and that all
is quiet on the Yalu.
It Is said that on the evening of the
disaster to the Petropavlovsk Vice Ad
miral Makaroff telegraphed to the Em
peror that he was about to light a de
cisive acMon with the enemy's fleet. A
story is circulated among tht* entourage
of the court that on hearing of the
catastrophe the Emperor wept and, re
ferring to Viceroy AlexieST, exclaimed:
"".That man brings us nothing but ill
luck." It is alleged that the Emperor
v.as with difficulty dissuaded from re
ruoving the Viceroy from his post.

PARIS, April 18. â The Echo de
Paris this morning publishes a dis
patch from its St. Petersburg corres
pondent saying that General Kuropat
kin had wired the Emperor of Russia
indicating the precise positions of the
Russian and Japanese troops on the
Yalu. The dispatch adds that heavy
rains have made the Manchurian
roads almost impassable and opera
tions have been suspended pending an
improvement in the weather.
The St. Petersburg correspondent of
the Echo de Paris cables the follow
ing: "According to an Investigation
made at Paris the Petropavlovsk ca
tastrophe was due to the explosion of
her cylindrical boilers. Two succes
sive explosions occurred under the
boiler deck. The authorities will not
admit that Vice Admiral Togo could
place a mine fo near the entrance to
the port without being perceived.
PORT ARTHUR, April 17.âRu

At the consulate the Prince and his

Though he Is handicapped by his
ignorance of the English language,
Prince Pu Lun, through the assistance
of his distinguished interpreter. Won
Kai Kah. readily shows himself to be
extremely democratic. He likes the
manners of the foreigner. He is a
medium-sized man. 32 years of age, and
is the first imperial Prince of China to
represent bis royal uncle at a foreign
exposition, or any other international
function. Prince Pu Lun also enjoys
the distinction of being- a- clever
botanist and a well-read student of
history, having acquired his knowledge
in thi? line from the histories of all
the nations, which have been translated
into the Chinese language.* A few
months ago he was suddenly made .to
appreciate his deficiency in the knowl
edge of English. and proceeded to in
struct himself, but found his time too
short to permit him to master the lan
guage. He, however, learned to write
his? name In English and apparently
dtlights in inscribing it beneath the
Chinese characters that designate his
rank In the royal family of Peking.
Wong Kai Kah is the tutor of the
Emperor's nephew. Wong has been in
San Francisco before, and he made ar
rangements for the Prince's visit to
this country, even to the selection of
his apartments at the different hotels.
The vice commissioner is a graduate
of the class of 1883 at Tale. Â» ~.
It was through Wong Kai Kah that
the newspaper representatives appealed
to the Prince for an interview, and late
last night the genial tutor of the royal
representative announced that Prince
Fa Lun was prepared to give an inter
view. In substance it follows:

while being driven to your city'e center on
our way to the ..Chinese quarter. But I have
rÂ»ad much of the United States. I know much
of j-our Interesting hirtory and have acquired
a great dral of information from Wong Kai

th!Â» country. During my 'stay In the United
States I hope to Improve- the opportunities af
forded roe for gaining further knowledge of
the Wentern hemisphere, the progress of which
has long interested the people of the Far
East, and none more so than my own country

Ae to my own country I must insiBt that, it
i* far more democratic than tbe ; world has
been inclined to believe. In our empire a man
born . in the lower walks of life has ample
chance to achieve power If his Inclinations are
In that direction. Our history will tell you
that Kim' of China's greatest statesmen have
iiix-n from the ranks of the lowlier clan*. To
these men are given advantage* that are de
nied to men born of title and the : hlrhÂ«r , staÂ«,

In other words, the rlee of the man from the

TUTOR GUARDS SPEECH.
Although Prince Pu Lun proudly re
fers to the democratic; conditions ex
isting in his native land, Wong Kal
Kah was careful that too much democ
racy did not show itself in the recep
tion accorded his Imperial Highness on
his landing here. When the Prince
took h!s seat in the carriage awaiting
him at the wharf, the Chinese Consul
General was politely Invited to take a
seat un on the driver's bench so that
no mistake In the distinction of rank
between the royal representative from
Peking and the local and modest con
sular service man could occur.
Another matter insisted on by the
Vice <JommiS8ioner was that no Chinese
women of lowlier station should ac
cept shelter under the big roof of the
Palace Hotel during the short stay of
Prince Pu Lun there. This particular
discrimination in caste was the special
subject of a communication sent to the
management of the hotel relative to the
Prince's occupation of apartments in
that hostelry and apparently referred
to two Chinese women who arrived on
the Gaelic with the Prince. One was
Mns. Chow Tszee Chi, wife of the sec
retary of the Chinese legation in Wash
ington, who is on her way to join her
husba'nd, and a friend, Mrs. Chu Sang
Teh. It would have been a great pleas
ure for these women could they have
rested their heads on downy pillows,
but the decree went forth that such
an act would be a violation of Oriental
traditions, so they humbly bowed to
the will of the Prince's tutor and
sought shelter at the Occidental, where
they discovered the consoling fact that
311 of China's dignitaries who have pre
viously visited this country had made
that well-known hostelry their home.

whatever achievements may be accomplished
by the man born with great advantages sur

entitled to.

BELITTLE TOGO'S CLAIM.
Russian Official Says Sunken Vessels
Did Not Strike Jap
anese Mines.
ST. PETERSBURG, April 17.â"Not
withstanding Vice Admiral Togo's
claim that -mines laid by hi# vessels
were, responsible for the disaster to the
Petropavlbvsk," said a high official who
is in a position to have access to all
Government reports to the Associated
Press, "lam more' than ever convinced
that the Petropavlovsk and the Pobieda
did not strike Japanese mines. Each
ship was struck under the/fiull amid
ships, while a mine would have ex
ploded/on first contact near the bow.
The fact that in both; cases the ships
were struck amidshjps might -warrant
the acceptance of the theory regarding
submarine vessels, although personally
I do not Jiold that Idea. The Pobieda
probably escaped the fate of the Petro
pavlovsk because she carried coal in
her bunkers between. the bottom and
the boilers, which, moreover, are of the
Belleville type, whereas the boilers of
the Petropavlovsk were of Scotch make
and were not protected by her bunk
ers.'.' Â¦ . ..-'â¢'â¢..
One of: the -shrewdest .naval attaches
at v St; vPetersburg:.* however, ' toUJ v the
Associated Press that he belleve<Â»~the
Japanese laid the mines which were re
sponsible for the disaster, pointing but
that this was one of the oldest sys
tems of blockading when ships did not
dare to run the risk of entering under
an enemy's guns. The attache said he
thought they would do this when he
noticed that the Japanese fleet always
made a wide detour -of the entrance.
It is also sfghificant that Chinese junks
have been reported 'as cruising off the
harbor, and it : is: considered possible
that th4 Japanese kept these junks
there systematically in order to throw
the Russians off their guard if they
were seen when the actual time arrived
to lay the mines.
Expressions of regret at the death of
Vice Admiral Makaroff are general
here. SneaVfng for the naval staff.
Commander Ogasawara h3s published
a lengthy statement in which- he la
ments the death of the Russian vice
pdmlral and pronounces it to be a loss
to the navies of the w;orld. Command
er Ogasawara reviews 'the life, profes
sional career and the personal attri
butes of Vice Admiral Makaroff. and
declares that he Is entitled to be
classed with the best admirals in the
world. â_
Vice Admiral Togo directed the flank
attack. He had the battleships Hat
fusc. Mikasa. Asahi, Shlkishima, Ya
shima and Fuji. He waited thirty
miles out at sea until Rear Admiral
Dewa signaled him by wireless telegra
phy to come in. His vessels then
dashed at full speed toward the en
trance of the harbor. All the battle
ships under Vice Admiral Togo are
capable of a speed of eighteen knots,
and they quickly covered the distance.
â¢It Is not clear what warned the Rus
sians that they had been trapped, but
they probably discerned the battleship
squadron on the horizon and retreated
precipitately to the harbor. Vice Ad
miral Togo did not succeed in .prevent
ing the Russians from re-entering, but
he did force them to a disastrous re
treat, which ended in the destruction
or the Petropavlovsk and the disabling
of the Pobieda.
After these occurrences the cruisers
Xisshin and Kasuga were used to bom
bard Port Arthur. They possess '.the
highest angled guns in the fleet, capa
ble of throwing shells to the elevated
Russian land works, which are beyond
attainment by the average naval
weapon.
Vice Admiral Togo calls this attack
on Port Arthur the eighth, whereas
here it is numbered the seventh. A
probable, explanation is that Vice Ad
miral Togo regards the latest opera
tion as two distinct attacks.
Rear Admiral Dewa was in command
of the Japanese? squadron which decoy
â¢ d the Russian ships over the field of
mines. His squadron consisted of. the
rruiscrs Chitose, Yoshino, Kasagi and
Takasago. a/1 . unarmored vessels,
which presented a tempting bait for
thp heavier Russian ships.
The weather of the night of April
12-13 favored the work. There was a
heavy rain, the nicht was dark and
cloudy and the Russian searchlights
playing over the channel failed to re
veal the presence of the Japanese de
stroyers.
When the destroyer divisions of the
Japanese torpedo flotilla laid the coun
termines, during the night of April
12-13. they placed them along this
course. The laying of these counter
mines was exceedingly perilous be
rause if any Japanese boat with mines
on board had been struck by a lucky
Russian shot, she would have been an
nihilated.
"The goal* is yet distant. Take thÂ«*
best care of yourselves in order that
you all may be enabled to finish the
great work expected of you."
The success of the system of placing
deadly countermines is due largely to
a series of careful observations made
by the Japanese during th^ir previous
attac'Â«- on Port Arthur. The Japanese
saw the Russian fleet leave the harbor
and return to it several times and they
discovered that the Russian warships
followed an Identical course every time
they came out or went in, evidently
for the purpose of avoiding their own
mines. The Japanese took bearings
on this course.
"I am delighted over the success of
the eighth attack on Port Arthur. The
tcsult was splendid, and while it is at
tributable to the Emperor's Illustrious
virtue, the loyal and gallant action of
the officers and men of the fleet played
a conspicuous part. Their behavior
leaves nothing to regret. I tender my
congratulations to you and to the offi
cers and men in your command, and I
hope that the same noble discharge of
duties will be continued white the pres
ent great national problem lits before
us.
TOKIO. April 17, 5 p. m.â The Jap
anese arc rlated over the successes
they have won at_ Port Arthur. They
are also proud of the achievements of
Vice Admiral Togo, particularly of his
newest strategy of countermining the
enemy's harbor anJ decoying him
across this field of mines to an equally
dangerous flank attack.
Admiral Baron Yamarnoto, the Min
ister of Marine, sent the following con
gratulatory message to Vice Admiral
Togo to-day:
The Emperor has, ; appointed Ylm-
Yun-Ghan, who was at one time Prime
Minister of Korea, to superintend the
reconstruction of the palace.
Sungjin is a small port on the. east
coast of Korea, about 150 miles north
east of Gensan and about the same dis
tance southwest of the mouth of the
Tumen River, which marks the north
eastern boundary between Korea and
Manchuria, j
SEOUL, Korea) April 17, 1 p. m.â It
has been learned here that thirty r three
Cossacks occupied Sungjin on ' the
night of April 16. -The Japanese
refugees who fled from there arrived
at Grensan this morning. The rumors
that 5000 Russian troops are following
this advance of thirty <*three men con
tinue, and it is declared that they in
tend to divert the Japanese from the
Yalu River. These statements, how
ever, are discredited because it would
be quite possible for th~ Japanese to
effect 1 a landing near. Sungjin and cut
off these troops. Two English mission
aries reside at Sungjin, but it is not
known whether or not they have left
there. They are not believed to be in
danger.

The torpedo-boat from which steam

news to the men of the batteries that
the vessel was the Strashni.
The unequal combat was observed
with breathless interest, but the net

LIAOYAKG. April 18. â The Asso
ciated Press correspondent, believinlg
that the Japanese would repeat the
attempt to block the entrance to Port
Arthur with fire ships on Easter eve,
went from Liaoyang to Port Arthur a
week ago yesterday. For four, nights
I watched with the sentries on Golden
Hill. Three nights passed quietly.
Tuesday night April 12,, Vice Ad
miral Makaroff took to the sea with
his entire squadron, including four
teen torpedo-boats. The next night,
April 13, in the teeth of a gale, eight
torpedo-boats were sent out to recon
noiter. From Golden Hill, on which I
was standing, through the blackness
the searchlights of the fortification
flashed over the inky waters of the
roadstead and far out to the hazy
horizon. . â¢
At 11 o'clock I heard firing at sea
and counted seven shots, but could
see nothing. At daybreak I made out
through the light haze to the south
ward, about five miles from shore, six
boats strung out in line, all firing. In
the lead and outstripping the others
was^a boat heading at full speed di
rectly for the entrance' of the harbor.
The last in l|ne was beclouded, in
steam and lagging. She had evidently
been hit. It was difficult to distin
guish our boats, but finally through
my glasses I saw that the leader and
the lag-ger were Russian and that the
four others were Japanese.- The flash
of the guns and the plash of the pro
jectiles as they struck the water
showed the intensity of the conflict.

"The ship seemed to be falling some

I heard the deafening screech and the
frightful din. The smoke rose in dense
clouds and the flames seemed to leap
toward the bridge where I was stand

the rail and was washed out. but suc

"On 1 our ship was an old man with

"The Petropavlovsk slowed speed and

violently. I .. heard another, explosion,

then another. They seemed to me to
be directly under the bridge. I rushed
to the door of the wheelhouse, where

I could not pass him and I sprang to
the window and jumped out. The ship
was listing and I feared every moment
she would turn over. . 1

cruisers which had remained' in the

, Eager, to ascertain what had hap
pened on board the sunken ship, I has
tened to a landing where a small rem
nant o| the gallant crew were being
put ashore and conveyed to a hospi
tal. Signalman Pochkoff, who was
slightly wounded, was able to give me
a remarkably clear statement of the
disaster. He said:
The floating woodwork and the few
men struggling in the water were all
that was left- to recall the splendid
fighting machine which a few hours
before had sailed out of - the harbor.
The same shock experienced by the ob
servers on Golden Hill paralyzed for
a moment the men on the ships,' but
when it passed torpedo-boats and small
boats . hastened to the rescue of the
survivors.
My glance returned to our squadron.
The Petropavlovsk was almost with
out headway, when suddenly I . saw
her tremble. She seemed to rise out of
the water- a tremendous explosion
rent the air, then a second and then
a third. Fragments flew in all direc

mixed up in a terrible mass. I was
hardly able to realize the horror of it,

Vice Admiral Makafoff was evident-'

craft to the heavy projectiles of the
enemy's armored ships. I. watched the
Petropavlovsk closely as 'she steamed
toward Electric; Cliff. The frowning
marine monster, .whose guns were ever

TORPEDO BOATS LEAP
Meanwhile, in accordance with Vice
Admiral Makaroff's order, the battle
ships and cruisers in the inner harbor
slipped anchor. Majestically the Petro
pavlovsk. flying the admiral's flag,
steamed through the entrance. On her
appearance the formidable array of
Japanese cruisers turned and fled. The
admiral signaled the Bayan to return.
Then a stream of vari-colored signal
flags fluttered out "Brave Bayan."
By this time the entire Russian
squadron was in the outer harbor. Be
sides the Petropavlovsk I saw the bat
tleships Peresvlet, Poltava, Pobeida
and Sevastopol, the cruisers Novik,
Diana and Askold and the torpedo
boats. The flags announcing the ad
miral's approbation of the Bayan were
hauled down and replaced by another,
signal. Immediately the torpedo-boata
dashed ahead and the heavier ships be
gan tc spread out.
Seeing the flight of the Japanese
cruisers, the Petropavlovsk opened fire
with her great guns, but the enemy
was out of range and soon disappeared.
Our sauadron continued the chase,
finally fading from view. I waited anx
iously foi its reappearance, and in
about an hour it came in sight. Far
beyond it the number of points from
which smoke arose announced the pres
ence of the enemy. Nearer and near

out behind our squadron a fleet of four
teen, of, which six were battleships and
the remainder armored and unarmored
cruisers."

Satisfied with what they had accom

turned and made off at full speed, fol

came six of the enemy's cruisers. Still
the Bayan went on, seemingly inviting
certain destruction. She soon ported
her helm to bring: a broadside to bear
upon the foe, which was advancing in

the city fire department, reinforced by
companies from the suburbs, was being
taxed to its^itrnost fighting the Occi
dental Hotel fire this morning an alarm
â¢was turned in from St. Vincent's Hos
pital. When the first fire company ar
rived one life had been lost and several
persons were seriously injured in the
panic that followed. The dead:
HARRIET LEAHY, jumped from the
fourth floor and instantly killed.
The injured are: Miss Kate Beach,
fatally injured by failing from third
floor; Sister Superior Stella, seriously;
Hister Nordica, seriously; William
Schneider, a patient, who at the time
of the flre was undergoing an opera
tion; Harry Nichols, ju?t operated upon
lor appendicitis.
Several other nurses and attendants
xvere more or less bruised in their en
deavor to escape from what they
thought was instant death.
For a time it seemed that the flames,
which started in a pile of rags, would
find their way to the upper floors. At
every window on the third And fourth
Hoors were crowded the panic-stricken
jren and women screaming for help
to those on the street below.
The panic that raged on the third
r.nd fourth floors continued until long
lifter the fire had been extingushed.
Pntipnts who had just undergone sur
gical operations rushed from their beds
to tW? windows and attempted to throw
themselves to the ground. In the i-ear
men and women made ropfcs of bed
< lothing, by which they escaped to the
cmund belov.-. Kate Beach lost her
hold and fejl from the third floor. She
is noTv in a critical condition.
An unusual number of surgical oper
ations were performed in the hospital
on Saturday. Many of the patients
carried from their beds by the rescuers
Â¦were in & critical condition, fend the
â¢physicians In charge fear that many
fatalities may result. The patients were
carried to the male ward, which is on
th*> first floor and was not seriouslj'
affected by the panic which raged in
the upper floors. Harry Nichols, who

HONOLULU, April 10. â When the
earthquake was destroying lives and
property in Macedonia, on April 4, a
sharp shock was experienced through
out the Hawaiian Islands. Xt the same
time the. cone- on the volcano of
Kilauea split with a roar. A great
cloud and column" of ,smoke and ashes
rolled out from the heart of the volcano,
startling some tourists who were for
tunate enough to be watching It. . A
guide- went down to the crater and
found that an explosion had split open
the cone," the noise proceeding from it
sounding like the boom and roar of a
mighty surf, with huge rocks thunder
ing down into the bottomless pit.' On
the following day another explosion,
but not so violent, occurred.
TACOMA. April 17.â The courage and
loyalty of his youthful and beautiful
bride were important factors in aiding
Captain Sautrel to save the French
bark Marguerite Dollfus on her stormy
voyage of SOS days from Hull to Puget
Sound. The captain was wedded a few
days before his vessel sailed from
Havre. He loaded at Hull and Dun
kirk, sailing: for Puget Sound with pig
Iron and cement. In August while in
the mid-Atlantic a- fearful hurricane
raged for many days* Terrific blasts
tore out most of the bark's upper rig
ging.
One fateful afternoon the first mate
was washed overboard from the main
yard. The vessel was brought to in an
almost suicidal effort to save him. Life
buoys were cast overboard and five
men stood ready to man a boat. The
sea was boiling, while the ship was go-
Ing along so fast that the mate was far
astern when the buoys were cast out.
To stay hove to meant foundering, and
the ship went on with the wind. For
days the deck was kept under four feet
of water, and It seemed as if the ves
sel would be beaten to pieces. A sailor
fell from the fore topgallant yard and
was instantly , killed. Several of the
crew becamt sick.
Then it wa\? that Mrs. Sautrel learned
what it meant to be. a sailor's bride.
She remained by her husband's side
day and night offerine words of en
couragement and cheer. They made
Rio de Janeiro, where the ship was re
paired and the sick sailors exchanged
for well ones. Severe storms were en
countered at Cape Horn. Food became
reduced to meat and biscuit and scurvy
broke out.
Captain Sautrel and his bride will
finish their honeymoon ashore.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
When Black reached San Jose ave
nue he wheeled, and said to Campbell:
"If . you don't "quit following me I'll
shoot you." . Then he ran along San
Jose avenue to Twenty-third street,
Campbell still in pursuit. Black doubled
on his tracks until he reached Twenty
second and Mission streets, where he
jumped upon a passing car. Campbell
says he told several men he met dur
ing his purswit of Black that he sus
pected Black was a footpad.
Another fact that confirms the sus
picions against Black is tne finding of
a cartridge on Fair Oaks street. Black,
during his flight, ran along Fair Oaks
street, and it is believed that he
dropped the cartridge while reloading
his revolver. The cartridge bears the
name "Peters" and those found on
Black when arrested bear the same
name. The officers say they, have never
known of any cartridges of that brand.
- The suspicion entertained by De
tectives Bunner and Freel that Jack
Black, alias Tom Callahan, ex-convict,
was Implicated in the recent holdups
In the Mission was verified yesterday.
Black was arrested on Eddy street last
Friday night, after a desperate fight
with the capturing officers.
Yesterday afternoon Frank Campbell,
a teamster living at 137% Fair Oaks
street, called at the City Prison with
detectives and identified Black as one
of the two men who had a running re
volver fight with Policemen Skelly and
Walsh on the night of April 10 in the
neighborhood of Twenty-third and Do
lores streets.
Campbell said he saw Black running
out of a lot on Alden alley, J between
Dolores and Fair Oaks streets and
Twenty - second and Twenty - third
streets. Campbell' asked Black what
was the trouble and Black replied that
he had just run out himself to see. what
was the matter. Campbell retorted:
"Well, you're going the wrong way."
Black ran down .Twenty-second street,
toward Valencia, and Canipbell, whose
suspicions had been aroused, ran after
him.
ALBANY. April 17.â If the polio
adopted by the friends of Judge Alton
B. Parker, at whose head stands for
mer Senator David B. Hill, is carried
out at the sessions of the Democratic
state convention to-morrow, there is
likely to be precipitated upon the floor
of the convention a battle royal w^tiich
has not had a parallel in State political
conventions for many years. Since the
Saratoga convention of 1900, when Gen
eral Charles N. Bulger of Oswego, rep
resenting Senator- Hill, putting " his
finger almost under the nose of Rich
ard Croker, denounced Tammany Hall
and its politics. Tammany has waited
as an organization to present its com
pliments to Hill, and although it is
perfectly apparent to-night that the
interests dominated by Hill control a
large majority of the convention's vote,
it is a foregone conclusion that such
orators as Bourke Cockran, Thomas F.
Grady, Charles A. Towne and Victor
Dowling will on the floor of the con
vention personally accuse Hill of at
tempting to wreck the party.
There was some discussion to-night
as to the platform to be adapted. It
is said to have been Senator Hill's,
idea that the platform should deal ex
tensively with x State and national is
sues, but William F. Sheehan, speaking,
it is believed, for Judge Parker him
self, has won to-night probably a con
cession so that the platform adopted
to-morrow will be very brief, dealing
not in any minute particulars, but gen
erally with the failures of the Repub
lican party. It is understood that it
will assert that since the death of
President McKinley the party in power
has practically run riot, has failed in
its promise to carry out McKinley's
policies, has catered to the corporations
and trusts and has demoralized the
public service. It will not'ln any way
allude to the monetary system, nor
will it indorse any particular platform
heretofore adopted by Democratic con
ventions. In a word, it -is intended, to
relieve Judge Parker if the convention
instructs for him until such time as
the national platform is adopted.
It is understood that v the delegates
at large to the national convention will
be former Senators David B. Hill of
Albany and Edward Murphy of Troy:
August Belmont of New York and
James W. Ridgeway of Brooklyn.
The convention will be called to or
der by Chairman Frank Campbell of
the State committee at 2 p. m. and af
ter routine matters are settled it will
be adjourned until 8 p. m., when Sena
tor Raines will be permanent chairman.
The battle on the floor of the conven
tion will take place at the evening ses
sion.
Morton had been employed on Doro
thy's ranch, thirty miles from Pendle
ton. Yesterday a misunderstanding
about wajges arose. Both- men became
enraged, and Morton ' left the ranch,
saying he *.vould return. He came to
this city, obtained a 38-caliber revolver
and returned to the ranch. Dorothy
had expected trouble and had armed
himself. As soon as the two men met
there was an exchange of shots, in
which ' Dorothy received a wound di
rectly over the .heart, Which the doc
tors say will prove fatal. Morton was
captured this afternoon, but beyond' a
declaration of shooting in self-defense
refused to talk.

realize that they are to manufacture

In this debate Stanford is to have
Frank Rohr and H. M. Lewis, both
heroes of one intercollegiate and two
Carnot debates, and Sheriffs, a member
of the last Carnot team. Against this
aggregation of veteran men California
Is to send Max Thelen, who has weath

Carnot and one Bonnheim discussion;
Joseph. P. Â«Lucey, winner of the last
Carnot medal, and Robert L. Me Wil

view of "experienced men Stanford
ought to win out. :
Stanford has. another advantage from
the point of view of-, the question. Her
team is to present the affirmative on a
question that is comparatively easy to
defend. -The. .question is, "Resolved,
that in -cities of the" United States of

of municipal government concentrating

KLEVESAHL FINALLY TAKES
ARTISTIC HIBBARD TROPHY
The cries brought Mrs. Fischel to
the door and when she opened it the
thugs fled. One went north on Louisa
street, and the other went up Univer
sity avenue to Milvia street and dis
appeared,, but not before Fischel had
secured his pistol and sent a shot after
them. The shot aroused the neighbor
hood and a search was made for the
fellows, but they had escaped for
good. ' *
Fischel said to-day that the high
waymen would have got $160 from him
if : they -had been successful in holding
him up. He believes the men are" two
who visited his place: yesterday after
noon .on the' pretense of inquiring: for
a , man named. Barnes. , He 'describes
them as young men" wearing slouch
hats.: . .... . ;
But the highwaymen did not shoot.
They hesitated to murder a man so
evidently contemptuous of death. " In
the meantime Fischel had retreated in
side his yard a few feet without being
noticed by the men and at the proper
moment he began to shout lustily:
"Help! Murder! Police!"
"All right," replied Fischel. "Can't
die but once. Might as well die now
as any time. Shoot away." ""â¢â¢->
"Thon we'll plug' you wl'Ji a bullet,"
said the second fellow.
"Throw up yoftr hands," commanded
the flrttmanas he rubbed the nose of
the pistol" against Ftschel'a breast- '*
"What for?" asked ithe victim.- ;^:
"We want your money," came thÂ«
reply. â¢Â¦â¢;..<
"You 1 can't have it," Fischel said.
Ignatz Fischers indifferent attitude
toward the threats of two thugs to kill
him saved him from being murdered
in 'front of his home at 19 JJ University
avenue at an early hour this morning.
The victim was absolutely contemptu
ous in his treatment of the, highway
men, so much so that it frightened all
their nerve away and them, too.
Fischel was about to enter his gate
just after closing up his meat market
when he was confronted ty a masked
man who flourished a big revolver.
When Fischel looked around to get his
bearings, for he was not frightened
he bumped into another masked man
with a "big pistol. This fellow had
jumped over 'the fen j of Fischel'9
neighbor, behind' which he had been
concealed.' Â¦â¢ : ' : -â¢ â¢Â¦ Â¦'â¢

Ignatz Fischel ? s Indiffer
ence to Death Men
Seeking to Get Hi* Money
"He might have shot m*. too, only
when I heard my wife cry out that she
was shot I lost my senses almost. It
made me so desperate that I went after
hira and shoved him through the door.
He tried to resist, but I was stronger
nn<l beat him. Thon I closed the door
in hi* fÂ«ce and that was th*Â» last I saw
of him."
"I was so dumfounded when I saw
the man and his pistols that I could
not move. My wife was standing near
tht rear room and I think it was fright
that caused her to run. The man
thought she was going for a pistol, but
Fhe didn't Intend that at all. She simpiy
Â¦went out and Btood in the alleyway,
Â¦waiting for him to go away. I think
that when he saw her there he thought
*be was going to shoot.
The victims of the hold-up all agree
on the description of the man that held
them up. They say he is tall and slight
and wore a mask and slouch, hat.
"The ma^k covered almost all his
head." said Werren. "There was only
a place for the eyes to peep through.
I dont think I could recognize him.
Jlr did not Â£(>t any of our money. I
was Just about to close up at the time
he came in, because it was after 8
o'clock. I had taken the money,
amounting to $10 or bo, out of the
drawer and put it in my pocket. The
drawer only contained a few nickels.
BECOMES DESPERATE.
"There's been a shooting scrape up at
the saloon," replied the man. and then
he disappeared in the darkness."
"I think the man I saw running is
the fellow that did the shooting. ' said
Sullivan afterward. "I was returning
from Berkeley and met him only a few
minutes after the shooting."
The desperado is supposed by his vic
tims to have taken the road to Ber
keley, where he could easily have taken
a train to any outside point. This be
lief is held because shortly after the
phooting a man was seen running
down the road toward Berkeley by
Louis Sullivan of the Sullivan ranch In
Wild Cat Canyon.
"What are you running for?" asked
Sullivan when he came across the fel
low.
RUN'S FROM THE SCENE.
"Git the woman back here," shouteJ
the bandit when he observed this
movement. The two men did not
move, through fear. Backing up to the
front door the highwayman " looked
eideways through it and saw Mrs.
Werren standing within range of his
gun and fired at her.
Mrs. Werren's husband was a spec
tator of the whole proceeding and the
moment his wife crted out from the
ehot he became derperately anxious to
eave her from further injury. Rushing
after the bandit as he stood leaning
against the doorway Werren threw al!
his strength against him.
Werren had a brief struggle before
h#> could force the bandit out and lock
the door. Werren expected every mo
ment to be ehot at through the door,
but nothing of the kind happened.
Lewis, the other man, did not partici
pate in this melee.
Mrs. Werren did not fall from the
effects of her wound, but walked about
In front of the saloon, crying piteously.
In a few moments the two prisonerB
decided to hazard going outside, and
they did so without any more attempts
b*ing made to shoot them. Then Mrs.
Werren was carried into her home and
Dr. J. Edson Kelsey summoned from
.Berkeley to attend her.
Dr. Kelsey, after an examination,
Baid that the woman would live. The
bullet entered her right breast and pen
etrated a part of the lur.g, a wound not
r.ecessisarily fatal. The bullet was
not extracted.
Mrs. Werren, Christ Werren, her
husband, and Frank Lewis, a friend,
were drinking at the bar of the saloon
a Mttle after 8 o'clock this evening
tvhen the bandit suddenly made his ap
pearance. His two big pistols were
staring into the faces of the trio before
thpy hardly knew what had happened.
"Throw up your hands," the fellow
demanded. Up went the hands of the
three victims. They had all been stand
ing at the end of the bar farthest from
the street. Just preparing to drink the
glasses of beer Werren had drawn. The
bandit kept his weapons leveled at the
heads of his victims. Not another word
had been Â£Â£>oken, and the fellow had
Just taken a steo forward when Mrs.
Werren, either through fright or a des

SHOOTS MRS. WARREN.
BERKELEY. April 17.â A desperate,
masked highwayman, backed by two
big pistols, hejd up Worren's saloon
on the road to Wild Cat Canyon
to-night and when his commands were
rot instantly obeyed he shot Mrs.
Licsel Werren, wife of the proprietor
of the saloon. The highwayman fled
Â«fter firing the shot, without getting
a cent of money, and the officers of the
law are now scouring the hills and
highways for him. Mrs. Werren is
dangerously wounded in the right
breast, but the doctor attending her
frays sh* will recover.
Mrs. Werren is a victim of either her
frierht or indiscretion. She might have
rseaped injury altogether had she not
ettempted to escape from the bandit;
he, believing that she was about to
ehcot him, turned one of his pistols
upon her and sent a bullet into her
body.

âÂ¦ There are some features of the sundry
civil bill which will cause discussion,
and it is believed that it will hold at
tention during Monday and Tuesday.
The pension, bill usually goes through
without debate," but it is probable there
will be quite a little discussion on the
pending bill.
If opportunity Is offered Senator
Hansbrough will endeavor to obtain
consideration of the Indian agreement
bills. Senator Fairbanks also stands
readv to seize the first chance that
offers to press his bill for a new ex
ecutive building in Washington.
Statehood and ship subsidy will be
the features of the House proceedings
this week, with conference reports and
minor bills to fill in the gaps.
The Committee on Rules on Monday
morning will decide on a programme
for the statehood bill. The rule In this
matter, which will be brought in â¢ for
adoption Monday, will call for consid
eration of the bill Tuesday with debate
limited probably to four hours. It Is
now the intention to. dispose of this
bill entirely % on Tuesday. The rule
making a special order for the Gardiner
bill providing for a joint, commission
of members of the House and Senate
to investigate the whole question of
ship subsidy during, the. recess of Con
gress v.-ill be brought forward by

this- measure will consume probably
six hours. The Alaska delegate bill
will remain the "continuing order" and
receive consideration whenever there is
nothing else before "the House. The

plates final adjournment April 28.
â¢WASHINGTON. April 17.â There will
be an effort to keep appropriation bills
to the front all the time during the
present week in the Senate, and to this
end- the sundry civil bill will be taken
up on the convening Monday. When it
is disposed of the pension appropriation
bill will be presented, and it is hoped
that that bill will In turn be imme
diately followed by the general de
ficiency bill. The Senate leaders are
apprehensive of the effect of the con
sideration of various bills on the cal
endar and are exercising their in
genuitv to keep them In the back
ground.
"Of the sixty cases of suspensions of
the rules during his administration
only thirty-three are of persons who
were allowed- to enter the service with
out examination. In other words, out
of over 70,000 appointments to the
competitive service since Hoosevelt
"The fact is exactly the other way.
There have been fewer appointments
without competetive examinations un
der President Roosevelt than under
any other President, and there has been
no' administration since the passage of
the civil t>*r\'ice act in which the com
petitive system has advanced with
greater rapidity and certainty. It has
been necessary for every President to
permit certain positions to be filled
without examination. The number
has been reduced from time to time
and the range of the competitive sys
tem extended. This process has gone
on faster under President Roosevelt
than under any other President.
WASHINGTON, Ap,ril 17. â Chair
man Gillett of the House "Committee
on Civil Service Reform recently wrote
to W. D. Foulke, former Civil Service
Commissioner, calling his attention to
the recent Congressional and other
criticisms of President Roosevelt on
the ground that he had made a larger
number of irregular appointments to
the classified service than any of his
predecessors, and, in view of the fact
that the period covered was while
Foulke was Commissioner, asking his
opinion of the chrages. In Foulke's
letter, under date of April 15, he
wrote:

"During the last year 4C88 more ap
pointments were made through com
petitive examination than In the prev
ious year and 3007 more appointments
were made in that year than in the
year before. Under President Roose
velt about 40,000 positions have been
added to the classified service.
"Heretofore extensions of the classi
fied ; service have usually taken place
near the close of an administration
and the exceptions made soon after the
new administration commenced. But
President Roosevelt at the . very ; be
ginning of his administration began to
extend the number of competitive posi
tions and to strengthen the, rules. He
also dealt out summary justice to'of
fenders.* several of whom held positions
in his own party." BBa SB9BB
"Moreover, prior to April 15, 1903.
there was a provision allowing
.artDointments without 'examination
where the position to be I filled
required such peculiar qualifications
ih respect to knowledge' and ability, or
puch scientific or special attainments,
wholly or in part professional or tech
nical, as -are not ordinarily acquired In
the executive service of the United
States. Under this provision President

President Roosevelt only five. Instead
of making appointments of thin kind

became President,' it was deemed un
necessary in these cases to require
competitive examination. These cases
form less than 1-20 of 1 per cent of
one of the appointments. They com
prise, for instance, a steward in the
White House, a coachman in the Navy
Department, two special agents in the
Bureau of Corporations, the superin
tendent of the Government Hospital
for the Insane and other cases, where,
on account of special reasons, the ap
plication was considered imprac
ticable, unwise and unjust or unneces
sary. These cases are explained in de
tail in the annual reports of the Civil
Service Commission. They were usual
ly made on the recommendation of a
Cabinet officer and with the approval
of the commission. In all of these
cases the person was excepted and not
the position. This has been found by
experience to be a much better plan.
The statement of Representative Hay
that durinp the administration of
Presidents Cleveland and Harrison
there were no suspensions of the rules
and only three during the administra
tion of McKinley. while in Roosevelt's
administration there have been sixty,
leads to a most erroneous* inference.
"Vnder orevious administrations ex
ceptions were not usually made by
means of suspensions of the rules, but
by means of changes in the rujes, thus
excepting certain classes of positions'
from competitive examination. From
time to time Presidents Cleveland,
Harrison and McKinley excepted from
competition hundred? of , positions
which had been competitive. On one
occasion alone (May 29, 1899) 8047 such
places were excepted. But these ex

which were the only matters called for
by the House resolution, f President
Roosevelt, however, made them In tho

the woodwork, thus completing a phase
cf work that has been successfully car
ried out in Los Angeles. Pasadena,
Riverside^ San -Jose, Vallejo, Eureka,
Alameda and in Oakland.
The enthusiastic chairman, Mrs. Orr,
suggests that now, since the possibili
ties cf schoolroom decoration
shown, that public-spirited men and
women help in the work that will inev
itably educate children â especially
those whose homes are devoid of it â
in the appreciation of art and artistic
surroundings. As a promoter of moral
ity and general rectitude, an attractive
environment has much to do.
Friday marked the beginning of a
notable work in San Francisco when
the Department of Education of the

by Principal Faulkner and co-operated
with by the Board of Education, has
decorated and made a repository of ar

Ladies, what think you of the con
vention â the first non-religious conven
tion on record wherein men and women
will meet upon equal ground â each
armed with credentials as delegates,
and â we fondly hope, with our parlia
mentary law with us? Wouldn't it be
tad if we didn't have as much to say
as the men do? However, perhaps our
<*ora Urquhart Lee reminiscences will
hflp us In our hour of peril.
Whatever happens, however, let us
fondly hope that our love of State will
promote the work in hand, and that
â¢sectionalism," the sin of the south,
may be forgiven in the Joining of fra
ternal ties and the uniting of common
interests. What is of benefit to the
south is likewise a benefit to the north
âand so. too. is the contrary true.
Therefore, let the work be State work,
without regard to petty provincialism.
and ten years hence California will
acknowledge with gratitude the work
begun by a woman, . agitated by the
clubs of women, and perfected by the
united action of the men and women.
And, while it is true that the women's
clubs are vitally interested in the good
roads movement, and that the Camino
Heal agitation was begun by a woman.
Miss Anna B. Pitcher, the matter can
hardly be claimed to belong, to the
womÂ»n of the State, as the men-who
do-things have taken up the matter,
and here is where success takes root.
Boards of trade, chambers of. com
merce, and other dignified and decorous
bodies of mighty-minded men have
harkened unto the gospel of "Good
Hoads," and thereby is the convention
that meets to-morrow in Santa Barbara
a possibility. Without the men, now,
fellow clubwomen, what would we do?
â that Is. after we've got our propo
sitions .started and growing. Then is
v, hen we need the men, with their wis
dom andâ their dollars.
Mrs. George Law Smith, president of
the State Federation, has taken much
pride in the work of the California his
tory and landmarks committee, whose
chairman, Mrs. A. S. C. Forbes of Los
Angeles, is a foremost exponent of the
Camino Real movement, and is one of
the delegates to the convention at
Santa Barbara.

you're clamoring for good roads and

The Papyrus Club held its regular
club day on April 14, at which there
was a large gathering of club members.
After the business meeting and the
nomination of officers and directors for
the coming year the club enjoyed its
usual club day's Impromptu pro
gramme. It was German humor day,
and Mrs. Henry Bergstein gave some
exceedingly funny exhibitions of Ger
man humor. Mrs. -W. W. Briggs sang
in an exquisite manner some German
songs and the members told German
stories. A toast written to Mrs. C.
Mason Kinne, the president, on the for
tieth anniversary of her wedding by
Mrs. Cooper was reread for the pleas
ure of the club by Mrs. G. W. Backus,
who had read it at the anniversary din
ner given by Colonel and Mrs. Kinne
at the Occidental Hotel last Monday
night. The entertainment closed with
the rendition of the "Two Lunatics,"
which was given under the direction
of Mme. Morrow Long. The characters
in the sketch were: Miss Clara Man
ners, Mrs. S. W. Backus, and Captain
George Fielding, by Mrs. Louise Bat
tles Cooper, who wore the full dress
uniform of a captain of the United
States army. The sketch was greeted
with exuberant laughter, the love-mak
ing scene between the two being the
essence of humor. The skit went with
a dash, that covered the actors and
their director with added glory. The
open or guest day will be held on April
22, when Miss McCloskey will present
a potpourri of song and story.
Resolutions of regret from the Wom
an's Auxiliary of the British and Amer

a clever leader, and the society has
sustained a distinct loss in her death.

Wilhelm is an admiral in the British
navy. A story of his last visit to a
British ship shows that he has the gift
of making himself popular. Followed
by a long train of officers in due order
of seniority, from the admiral down to
the junior officer on duty, he made a
thorough tour of the ship, coming at
last to the sick quarters. In one of the
sick bays stood a weird-looking plant,
consisting of a long, attenuated stalk,
with a couple of melancholy looking
leave"?. Coming: to a dead stop
before this mysterious effort of
nature, the Kaiser pointed at
it in silence. "Admiral." he
asked at last, with an appearance of
the deepest Interest, "what is that?"
The admiral's botanical education did
not run to a solution of the problem, so
he turned for aid to his immediate suc
cessor, who, similarly embarrassed,
passed the query further back, until^it
reached the junior at ' the end of the
line, and was still unanswered.
All the time Kaiser â¢ Wilhelm stood
waiting for Information with a look of
exaggerated anxiety upon his face. At
last, vhen Informed that absolutely no
explanation of the . phenomenon â¢ was
forthcomings he burst/out laughing:, and
exclaimed, "Hurrah! At last I've found
something that thÂ« British navy doesn't
know!"
Music On Tap
Indications point to the realization of
the dream of Bellamy, depicted In one
of his books, where music of any char
acter is always instantly obtainable by
the mere touch of a button conveniently
located in the library, bedrbom or any
other place. This, luxurious idea is
about to be carried out -by a company,
consisting largely of Baltimore men,
and which Is being organized under the
laws of the State of Massachusetts. The
object of the concern, which is known
as the Cahill Telharmonic Company,
and which is an adjunct of the New
England Music Company, Is to place
in practical operation for commercial
purposes the Invention of Thaddeus Ca
nill,' at present of Holyoke, Mass/This
invention is a machine for : producing
every primary vibration 'known' to the
human ear. These range from the min
imum vibrations that can be heard, 16
to a . eecond, to the maximum , of 8000
a eecond. The 'New England Music
Company, \vhlch Is the" holding
pany, is licensed to "supply /music, by
this device to the New England States.
It has a capital of $200,000.
The object of the Telharmonic Com- v
pany of New England will be to supply
music to orivate residences and apart
ments from a central station via the
electric wires | in common use or new
wires to be strung by the company. The
amount of 'capital stock for this" first
company is placed at* $2,000,000. '/'
The Diamond Center.
' Amsterdam is by far the greatest
i diamond cutting; and polishing center
in the world. Some diamonds are cut
I and polished in Antwerp and London,
jxew Tork and other cities. The in
j dustry in these places, however, is
' small compared to that of Amsterdam.
Nearly all the rough diamonds from
South Africa, Brazil, British Guiana,
Australia, and Borneo are taken to
Amsterdam to be split, cut and pol
ished. 'There are sixty-four factories'
in Amsterdam, with 8956 emploj'es.
I The diamond workers are divided Into
splitters, cutters and polishers. The
splitters receive from $14 to $20 a
I week, and the cutters and polishers
from S10 to $14 a week. A writer
in Die Woche (Berlin) describes the
method of diamond polishing as fol
' lows:
The first ihing that is done with the
raw diamond is to chip it. to '"kloven"
it. as the Hollanders say, in Avhose
hands rests nearly exclusively the
business Â«f diamond polishing. This
chipping Is necessary because of flaws
which are present in all diamonds.
After the stone has been chipped It
ffoes through the cutting proipes, that
I*, the laying out of the determined
form of facets, the most beautiful ar
rangement being the double-stone
with sixty-four facets. After this the
"glypen" may begin, thi? latter process
being performed with a isteel diamond
cutter's wheel on which the finest dia
mond powder has been spread â -"the
powder being obtained from diamond
waFte â the wheel turning with great
speed. The faces of the stone are
held against the wheel until a perfect
polish is obtained. The final "karat"
of the diamond is then determined,
while the value of the stone is gauged
according to clearness and color. A
faultless stone of one karat is valued
at some fifty-five dollars, but one of
ten karats is worth one - hundred
times as mach. Especial peculiarities
of the trade in loose stones are that
all transactions take place through
brokers â buyer and seller never
knowing each other â and that all set
tlements must be made in gold. â Pub

A Remarkable Index
Sp*-o:al CorrejrorwJpnee.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALL,
f. HENRIETTA STREET. COVENT
GARDEN. LONDON, April 5.â In Lon
don there will be completed in the next
month or so one of the biggest tasks of
a literary kind ever perhaps under
taken by any one man. This is the
work to which the late Benjamin
Franklin Stevens, United States dis
patch agent in London for over forty
years, devoted a large part of his life â
the making of a complete index of all
the official documents that exist on this
side of the ocean regarding the Ameri
can Revolution and the making of
peace thereafter.
It is difficult to give a true idea of
how tremendous an undertaking this
was, but it occupied Mr. Stevens and
the twenty or more assistants, whom
he paid out of his own Docket, over
thirty years to gather the necessary
material. At the end of that time they
had catalogued all the documents re
lating to the revolution in the posses
sion of the British Government, in pri
vate collections in this country and all
those in the Government archives of
France, Spain and Holland, the three
European powers concerned in the
war. The documents thus catalogued
amount to over 161,000 in all. and the
immense index in which the character
and location of every one of them is
indicated fills ISO folio volumes, each
containing about 500 pages.
Mr. Stevens kept no actual record of
the amount of money which he spent
upon this work, but estimated that it
was in the neighborhood of 5100,000.
He died two years ago, leaving the
work unfinished. All the material, was
In hand, however, and for the most
part already Incorporated In handsome
ly bound volumes. Mrs. Stevens and
her late husband's partner immediately
sat about com^letins; the index, and
the last ten volumes 0/ it are now be
ing bound.
Stevens' expectation was at the be
pinningr that the United States Gov
ernment, recognizing the importance of
the work he had planned, would fur
nish the funds for carrying it out, and
his final hone was that Congress would
buy the index for the Congressional
Library, but though a bill to that ef
fect was reported favorably on by two
committees of the House of Repre
sentatives the matter never got any
further.
Benjamin Franklin Stevens, who was
a Vermonter, came to London in 18C0.
lie already had had a good deal of ex
perience with historical documents, for
as assistant to his father, who was
president of the Vermont Historical
and Antiquarian Society, he had copied
many old state naDers, both at Albany
and Boston. Mr. Stevens had been in
London tbree or four years when It be
came necessary that he should make
some transcripts ons of documents in
the public record office of England re
lating to New Jersey, and then it was
that he discovered that to these, as to
the other documents concerning Amer
ica in different British and foreign re
positories, there was absolutely no in
dex. It soon became evident to Mr.
Stevens that he would be called upon
to make constant reference to docu
ments of this kind for several years
to come, so he besan making careful
notes of *;ach one of them that passed
through his hands, with the result that
in 1SS2 he had gathered no end of ma
terial.
In 1SSI Secretary of State Bayard
wrote to James Ku*s*Â»H Lowell, then
American Eraba^sador to th" Court of
St. Jam*"*, that in view of the prepara
tions then being made in the Uni
ted States for celebrating the one
hundredth anniversary of the recogni
tion of American independence, it was
dosir^d to eain permission from the
Mriiish Governmtnt to make as com
plete possible an index to the
American historical documents in the
archives of Great Britain. This per
mission was grranted and Mr. Dwijjht.
Chief of the Bureau nf Uolls and Li
brary, was sent over to make the index,
but when he got here the magnitude of
the task that he had undertaken stag
gered him. He could not possibly give
the time to It that would have been
necessary. *o he returned to the TTnited
States without having accomplished
anything.
Then it was that Benjamin F. Stevens
communicated with the State Depart
ment, describin? tho woik he had al
ready done toward indexlnj? the Euro
pean Americana and offering to com
plete hie task on behalf of the Govern
ment. Much official correspondence
followed and Mr. Stevens, who had the
support of Lowell. Edward Everett
Hale and many other distinguished
Americans, was so much encouraged
that he went on steadily with his task.
In England he was given every facility
by the Government officials, and in
France, Spain and Holland the various
representatives of the United States
aided him. The matter came before
Congress in 1SS4 and 1887; but. as has
been said, never got beyond the com
mittee stage.
* * *
The ISO volumes which contain Mr.
Stevens' indei are written entirely by
hand in a "copper-plate" that is a de
light to the eye. And to show with
what infinite care this monumental
Index was prepared, \i ra&y be said
that the volumes consist of three sets,
fifty of which grve a Uet of the Euro
pean historical Americana in the order

THE governing conditions in trade last week were
rather adverse than otherwise. First, the weather
was unfavorable; second, stocks of some important
staples showed a marked increase with less consump
tion, and, third, labor conditions became threatening at
a number of points.
Â» i : ...;â¢â¢Â¦.. ':Â¦, . â¢
The weather has been a serious drawback to business
for several months. It set back the regular: spring de
mand at least a month, and when the tide oft trade be
comes checW?d for any fength of time 'it seldom fully
makes up the deficiency when its flow is resumed. There
are certain seasons when certain kinds of goods are
used, and if the time for using them goes by they; are
no longer wanted. Thus spring goods are no longer, in
demand in a wholesale way, and though the retailers
may selPmore or less the wholesalers and jobbers "are.
now. devoting their attention to summer goods* and in
the larger houses even the summer business is already
off the boards and the buyers are looking for fall arid
winter assortments. This illustrates how a backward
season may cut down the regular spring or summer de
mand for merchandise io a small volume. .
This year the weather has been so unpropitious that
it has not only seriously reduced the volume of spring
trade but has done more or less damage to the growing
crops. Thus the wheat crop, was kept back during the
winter, and though a spell of fine weather a fortnight
ago produced a marked improvement in conditions, the
reports last week suddenly turned unfavorable again.
From Kansas, Oklahoma, the Middle West, the Ohio
Valley and the Northwest all sorts of poor reports were
received. The_jweather was cold, with snow and mud, at
the very time when the crop needed warmth and sun.
In North Dakota and the Red*Rivcr Valley in partic
ular it was reported that the farmers would not be able
to get on to their fields before the 1st of May, and that
under the snow which still lingered there was a foot of
mud. These bad reports appeared suddenly and all came
in together, and though some were subsequently par
tially contradicted it was evident that crop conditions
were not as favorable as they had been.
Cotton, too, has felt the effects of the cold weather
and the crop hate been cut down by a severe frost in
Texas and along the northern part of the belt. This
had its effect on the market and led to an enormous de
mand for cotton on Thursday, when 17,500 bales were
sold in the open market at New Orleans, and on the Ex
change one transaction of 9000 bales was made, it be
ing the largest single spot transaction in the history of
the Exchange. The spot quotation showed no particu
lar change, but the downward trend of the market was
checked.
As for the increasing supplies of the more important
staples, the condition is not altogether new, but is be
coming more pronounced. At first it was confined to
iron and steel goods. It then appeared in provisions,
which were produced in large quantities by the Western
packers and persistently unloaded upon the outside trad
ers, who bought " largely and with equal â¢persistency.
The market reports of the newspapers called attention
to this, but the outsiders went on buying just the. same,
and did not wake up to what they were doing for sev
eral weeks. Then they found themselves loaded with
large lines of pork products and not much of a market
to work them off on. Now it is reported that stocks of
dry goods, from producer to consumer, are larger than
desirable, while sales are smaller. â¢
â¢ There is also less call for leather footwear, as the very
wet weather has diverted the demand to rubber goods,
and the inquiry for woolen goods is not up to expecta
tions. The iron and steel trades are still sending in con
flicting reports, some sections reporting business ex
panding and others the reverse. The general condition
of this industry, however, seems to be better thail it was
several j months ago. But the demand is not urgent at
best and buyers exhibit no eagerness to procure supplies
of the raw material. Building materials are not meeting
with any extra inquiry, the weather and many small la
bor complications throughout the country restricting
building operations.
Statistical conditions, too, are hardly what could be
desired. The bank clearings continue to show a decrease
from last year, and while it is not large is persistent, and
the aggregate clearings, which for a number of years
have generally exceeded $2,000,000,000, are now almost
always below this amount. ' Those of last week were
$1,975,820,000. The week's failures were 225,- against 212
last year, though none of them were heavy enough to
attract attention beyond their local sections. The rail
road earnings during the first week in April were 7 per
cent smaller thaa during the corresponding week last
year, and the returns for the first quarter of the year
will, it is thought, show^ that the railroads are barely
holding their ovvn in comparison with the past' year or
two.
Turning from tHis rather unfavorable exhibit of
domestic trade in general to "'the money and stock
markets we find a more favorable state of affairs.'
Money is reported in liberal supply at low rates
of . interest everywhere and the outflow of gold
from New York to Europe is fully offset by imports
of Japanese gold at San Francisco. Standard stocks are
paying their regular dividends, but the railroads are bor
rowing too much money and in too large blocks to suit
the investing public, hence business on the -Stock Ex
change is quiet. .During the past few days the consen
sus of authorities as to the future of the market seems
to have undergone some change; there is less optimism
and \ fewer predictions of a forthcoming bull movement,
owing largely to the impaired prospects of the wheat
crop mentioned abov^e. -
The conditions in California show no particular
change. Variable weather during the past week has al
tered the complexion of the crop prospects, the hot dry
spell at the beginning of the week, followed by .showers
at the close, rendering conditions irregular, though the
net situation remains about as before. Good crops^of
almost everything are almost assured. Thus far, there
have been no killing frosts to cut down the fruit crop,
though the Weather Bureau reports more or less damage
by the cold rains of a month ago, which caught several
of the early varieties in blossom, to their detriment. .No
fears of any .shortage are'expressed'in any quarter,' how
ever. As for grain and hay, fair, if not full, crops of both
are practically assured. Domestic and export trade is
reported brisk' and money. continues abundant and, easily
obtainable on; average securities. Real estate transac
tions show, active investment in both city and country
while building operations in San Francisco
continue large.- -There are' no 1 signs of any: falling off in

The Russian Censorship.
A clear, accurate statement of what
has Â¦ actually happened with regard to
the removal of the Russian censorship
of news would be as follows: After
considering a suggestion of Melville*
Stone, the Czar ; has abolished the cen
sorship of the Associated Press cable
news service. That is all.. .-. .
The censorship in Rursia Is exercised
over all printed matter, whether print
ed in the country or not. In the two
capitals, St. Petersburg and Moscow,
the daily papers are not actually sub
jected to the censorship. ; The censor,
however, reads the- printed sheet be
fore any one .else, and if it contains
anything forbidden, the edition is sup
pressed. .Editors are permitted, to
criticize the local administration, but
not to say anything which can be con
strued" as reflecting upon the higher
authorities or .Jhe church. Three warn
ings are given; the first consists in the
prohibition of street sales, the second
in a fine, the third means suppression,
of the publication..; The strict censor
ship in St: Petersburg and Moscow
has been abolished since tlie reign of
Alexander II. The provincial news
papers, however, are still subjected to
a^burdensome censorship. Editors must
submit proofs. of every article to the
censor before they are published. This
concession of the; Czar has' aroused
considerable interest among Americans
as to what j Russians themselves read
in the way of periodical literature.âRe

AN interesting illustration of the manner in which
the House of Representatives discusses bills that
are before it, and also of the degree of interest
Eastern people take of Pacific^ Coast affairs, is shown in
a report by one of our Boston exchanges of a recent de
bate on a bill to provide for a Delegate in Congress from
Alaska.
The report says that in the course of the debate "Mr.
Granger of Rhode Island briefly discussed the business
feature of the social -system of the United States, and Mr.
Bowers of Mississippi answered â some - statements re
cently made by Mr. Gillett of Massachusetts regarding
violations of the constitutions of some of the .Southern
States with respect to negro suffrage.. He made a com
parison of the criminal statistics of Massachusetts and
Mississippi and said these showed that the negroes in the
latter State were six times better: than those, of Massa
chusetts. He said that the negro was not fit for self
government and he was greeted with Democratic ap
plause when he said the negro^ within .' constitutional
limits, should be eliminated as a political factor. T thank
God,' he added, 'the constitution of Mississippi swept the
circle of expedient to accomplish that' end.' "
After giving considerable space to all that was said
upon the negro question, the report* adds: "The Alaska
bill was then laid aside and a bill was passed providing
for the cession of 120 acres of land in Colorado to, the
Beecher Island Battle Memorial Association." Of course
much allowance is to be made for the burning zeal of the
members from Massachusetts and from Mississippi on
the negro question, but at least a little attention should
have been. given to, Alaska. It is a big country and its
claims for. a Delegate in Congress deserve a hearing. '

It was about the time that Mayor

shortly after his re-election that _a

that he wanted to see. the Mayor on
personal business and wrote his name,
John Smith, on a card.y -/â¢
Keane took . the card \ to/ the , Mayor
in his private office and the latter, af
ter looking at it, said: "I really cannot
recall the name, but _ show the man in
anyhow."
Mr. Smith ambled slowly into the
Mayor's sanctum and, at once began:
t "Mr. â Mayor, I have come to see you
relative . to obtaining one of the sine
cures which you are at present dispens
ing to deserving^persons. I am John
Smith.' I was on the* committee of the
Forty-Fourth District when you were
running for the.mayoralty and worked
hard In your behalf. You know me
all right. Now, what is it to be?"
The Mayor listened to his .voluble
visitor until he had finished and then,
with a merry twinkle in his eyes, said:
"Well, I guess I do know you, but for
the life of me I cannot place you."

THE Chicago Superintendent* of Schools and Board
of Education have decided upon a novel experiment
to be introduced into all the public schools of the
city for the^purpose of teaching young America the prin
ciples of self-government at first hand. They will organ
ize, the; schools into" miniature municipal^ State and na
tional governments, upon the broad principles of equal
suffrage and' representation according to the latest' re
ports of the school census; each elementary school will
be represented by members in the lower House of the
model Congress and the Senate will be made an august
assemblage by being drawn directly from the high
schools. Every cog in the machinery of government will
be in'its place and. moving. â¢ Â¦" : V Â¦- â¢Â« j
It is to" be hoped that the Chicago experiment will
prove a.success. At present time the only notion. of gov
ernment -._ which a child in the public; (schools obtains is
through a dry-as-dust textbook; thrust at him while he is
yet at the tender age of 12 or 13, and made doubly incom
prehensible by the comments of the teacher. What idea
of the true, order of things can your average boy gather
from the statement, for example, that the Federal Cir
cuit courts have appellate jurisdiction over, such and
such cases* and original jurisdiction -in these and those
instances, or that a. "shocstring T distfict". r is one, which? has
been gerrymandered ?â Not that the textbooks are not ex
cellent in their way or. thai the teachers are not couscienr
tious in their endeavor to make the high light of govern
ment break in upon their: young charges; the difficulty
lies simply in the fact that the instruction lacks anything
tangible. .
Over in Oakland there is a society of little. folks who
have organized themselves into what they call The Bird
-Republic. They have a president and his cabinet^tburts
and their bailiffs and all the accessories' to a well ordered
Not only do they get lots of fun out of their game
of government, but the. little: follows are learning from
the ground up the principles of good citizenship and in
telligent suffrage. They tell a story over, at the Univer
sity of California about a brilliant freshman who asked
his instructor in United States history why the members
of the college of electors should not be made to retain
office during* good, behavior like the Federal Judges.
That freshman had passed an entrance, examination in
-civil j government before he entered the university upon
the information which had been crammed into his head
while he was a youngster not yet in high school. How
many more just such ignoramuses there arc "one dare
not guess. s"^
If the Chicago scheme prove a success it may be in
troduced at some time or another into every school which
is supported by the money of the people. There is no
better place for a future citizen and taxpayer to learn the
actual operations of the Government which he will help
to support and of which he is to be a member than right
in the schoolroom where the whole machinery of the
State may be set Vo work under his eyes and with his
assistance. ,Â¦ > \

was a programme, to which no on*
could take exception. .We have >en r

ahead of us to do and we are confident
CON'CEUT OF ACTION.
George \f. Scott Is the president of
the Alameda Advancement Association.
He is prominent In business and is
characterized for thoroughness and
energy. "We mean business," said Mr.
Scott, in an Interview with a repre
sentative of The Call. - "There will b^
no froth; no bubbling over; no un
fulfilled promises. Tbe association will
carefully consider what can be done
and will then proceed to the execution
of its self-imposed tasks in the order
of their selection.
"We have beautiful streets in Ala
meda and a beautiful city. Our first
move, in connection with- the Adelphi
Club- was the planting of palm tree3
about the Alameda High School
grounds. We hope to have the plant-
Ing of trees pursued with regard to a
determined plan. We are co-operating
with the West End Improvement Club
In the matter of securing a better road
way to connect Oakland and Alameda,
by "way of East Webster street. The
Realty Syndicate will assist in this im
provement. What I can say for the
city of Alameda would fill a great deal
of space. The essential point Is that
Alameda Is the nucleus for great
things. It will be our aim to add to
Alameda all that our efforts, in co-op
craticn with all other agencies, can
bring to pass."
Not less decided was Secretary El
mer E. Johnson in speaking of the In
tentions of the Alameda Advancement
Association regarding the promotion of
the city of Alameda, "We are going
ahead." he said. "Nothing can stop
us. The whole story of how this ad
vancement association came into exist

in their call for the meeting at which
the association was inaugurated serves
wry well . as a keynote to the entire
matter. . '
The- latest organization for civic ad
vancement Is the Alameda Advance
ment Association. Its motto, formally
adopted. Is "AJameda to the Fore."
Its programme is summed up, general
ly, . in its constitution and by-laws.
Therein it is made obligatory upon the
association "to consider all subjects
tending to promote the welfare of the
city of Alameda; to plan and recom
mend the adoption of such measures
as will tend to beautify the city of
Alameda and add to its attractive
ness." Among the committees provid
ed for is one on public affairs, which Is

In response r , to General MacArthur'a
inquiries, General Lauck stated that
he would be able to furnish about 2000
men for the maneuvers, provided the
time is set during the latter part of
August. or September. , It was agreed
that the latter part of August would
be the' most suitable time, and Gen
eral Lauck took his departure, after re
ceiving assurance from Â¦ General Mac-
Arthur that he would soon â¢ submit
plans for the maneuvers to the military
department of the State.
General MacArthur says it. is his
intention to devote fifteen days to the
maneuvers, which he purposes to have
take place on some site in the "Interior
of the State, to be " selected by him.
Doubtless the location will ,be one of
the sites recently considered by the
army board, while it was searching for
a permanent camping ground. The Na
tional Guardsmen will go into the camp
on a footing with the regular troops,
of which it is contemplated to drill
several thousand, and will be thor
oughly instructed under the eye of
army experts in the maneuvers of war
fare and camp life. During their ser
vice in camp the guardsmen will re
ceive the same pay and rations as the
regular troops, ample provisions being
made in the.Dick bill for their care on
such occaelo'ns.
Major General MacArthur, command-
Ing the Department of California, held
a- conference yesterday with Adjutant
General Lauck of the National Guard
relative to a plan, which the former has
under consideration, for the co-opera
tion of the State troops with those of
the regular army in a" series of field
maneuvers during the latter part of
August, as provided for in the recently
adopted Dick bill. **
The bodies of two men who are
supposed to have sought death by
means of carbon monoxide are at the
Morgrue, and in both cases financial
embarrassment is believed to have
been responsible for their desire to
end life's battle.
James" McGinty, a waiter, had a
room at 118% Ellis street,* but as he
was two months in arrears with his
rent. the landlord, Joseph Collin, told
him to quit # and locked the door of
his room last Friday. McGinty re
tained the key of the room. He at
tended the ball of the Cooks' and
"Waiters' Alliance at 111 Turk street
on Saturday night and then went back
to the room he had been ordered to va
cate. Yesterday morning Collin dis
covered that gas was escaping from
the room, and when he opened the door
he found McGinty dead. The body was
removed to the Morgue by Deputy Cor
oner Fennell. McGinty was a member

P. Finnan rented a room at 214
Third street between three and four
o'clock on Saturday 'afternoon. Yes
terday morning Mrs. Sadie Whelage,
the housekeeper, opened the door to
make the bed and found the room full
of gas which was escaping from an
open jet. Finnan was in bed breath
ing: heavily and a telephone message
was sent to the Central Emergency
Hospital for the ambulance. When
it reached the house Finnan had
breathed his last. From papers found
by Deputy Coroner Fennell. Finnan,
who .was about 35 years of age, had
apparently been in Manila till last Oc
tober. There was a letter of introduc
tion from Walter E. Thompson, "of
fice of the Depot Commissary,
Manila," dated October 8, to Phil. E.
Scheu, 34 Market street. Another
letter from J. Finnan, St. Mary's Col
lege, Oakland, dated March 29 last,
was' addressed "P. Finnan, U. S. Com
missary, 103 Market street, San Fran
cisco." ' It referred to a loan made by
the writer to Finnan and insisted
upon the amount being paid. A pawn
ticket for a gold watch, dated April
13, was rilso found. He used to live
at 214 First street.

POSTUM CEREAL.
D1DXT LIKE IT.
Soon Found Why.
Coffee has a terrible hold on some
people.
"About 8 years aeo I was a great
sufferer from 6toaiach trouble; my liver
was all out of fix and a wise doctor
forbid tea and coffee. At that time I
was so weak I could hardly walk, ab-
solutely poisoned.
"One day I noticed Postum in the
store and having read about it I bought
a package and made some. I did not
like it but tried it again and followed
direction* carefully. It was not long be-
fore I liked it better than any other
drink and it has brought me out of all
the old coffee troubles, too.
"I can now eat what I want, am
strong and healthv and the effects of
Postum on me were so good all our
family soon drank it.
"In summer when the weather is hot
I do' not have that 'all gone' feeling
now* for when I drink a cup of Postum
it refreshes and strengthens but never
has the bad after-effect like coffee.
"Postum is like everything else â it
needs to be made right and there is no
better way than the directions on the ,
package." Name given by Postum Co.;
Battle Creek; Mich.
>There'e a reason.
Look in each package for the famous
little book. "The Road to Well ville."

This thought led the doctor to the
labor situation. He said that on the
one hand a body of men organize and
frequently their epirit la to get as
much work a* possible for as "little
pay as possible. On the other
hand, laboring men .organize, 'and
sometimes their spirit is to do as little
Â¦work as possible for as much pay
as possible. If employers should
b* anxious to pay as much as they
rightly could and if employes were as
anxious to rÂ«nder as much service for
what they get the labor question would
bÂ« Â»Â«eUled.
The doctor was strong in ihs
denunciation of greed, the desire to
make money eimply for the sake of
having it. and said that greed could
bÂ« in the poor as easily as in the rich.
It Is not the question of how much a
man haa. but the spirit he has with
rejrard to it.
"The -difficulty." he said, "is that
some realize they are rendering a serv
ice and others do not.. Some put
their whole spirit into the service re
quired of thorn and others render
service because they cannot avoid it."

SAX MATEO, April 17. â The Olym
pic Club lacrosse team suffered an
ovenvhelmlnx defeat at the hands of
the Talagdoa^on, C "W. Clark's field
this afternoon, the score being 14 to
1. The visitors were as children In
the hands of the practiced Talagoos
who surpassed themselvesâ in both
team and individual work. The score
was so Uneven" that after making the
fourteenth goal in the fourth quarter
they ceased their efforts to put the
ball in the net, but gave an exhibition
of team work until even McLaughlin,
field captain of the Olympics, called on
them to play ball. **?Â£Â¦
Then some one of the spectators
shouted "Put them on a silver basis;
make it 16 to 1." which put both
sides on their mettle and so thorough
ly stirred up the Olympics that they
prevented their opponents from scor
ing again. This was the most ex
citing period of the 'game. The ball
hovered constantly about the Olym
pics' goal, but the magnificent defense
of Burden and Welsh kept it from be
tween the posts. The Olympics have
plenty of pluck and several fine play
ers, but they lack, practice as a team.

Score^ â Tacoma 3, Los Angeles 2. The
game was witnessed by the largest
crowd that ever assembled on the
grounds here, numbering about 7000.
Newton and St. Vrain were the oppos
ing pitchers and both did first-class
work. The chamoions, however, as
has been the ca^se in all the games
against Tacoma, could not hit the
ball when men were on bases. Twice
in to-day's game a hit of any sort
would have won the game for them,
but it was not forthcoming. There
was a constant series of kicks by
both teams against Huston's
decisions. The score:

Fair Tralee, a greyhound from the
kennels of T. J. Cronin, defeated the
St. Louis crack, Lord Brtizen, at Union
Coursing Park yesterday in three
straight trials! The scores were 7-1,
4-3, 6-2.
The trials were the second In the
series for the Grand National Cham
pionship stakes, in which the best
eight coursers In the State are to com
pete, one pair starting each week. The
winners will be paired . off until the
last two meet in the decisive struggle
for the long end of the purse.
Hall's double to the left field fence
in the seventh, followed by Delehantys
timely eingle, netted another for the
north, rtnd the last one happened in
< the final round, when Frisk was again
| tapped .in the xibs and Boe,ttger lÂ£t
| him go to third by making a wild throw
j to first. H<? hud little trouble in reach
! fcig the ol.ite on Delehanty's long fly
j to Dunlevy.
Dick Williams had the whole Oak
i land layout on his staff from the time
j the bell tapped. Six of them hit nothing
i and few hit safely. He fielded in grand
form an<i was possessed of everything
a pitcher needs to bt-at the other fel
lows. H<Â» covered first base twice, and
thereby cut off what looked like sure
hits. Every" time he came to the bat
he was givtn the hand of welcome by
the fans.
Mohier figured in two lively double
i plays with Hull andf Brashear assist
i insr. Lonman hurt nis hand in the
j eighth and retired in favor of Boettiger.
! Van Haltren's wonderful work on the
i bases brought down the bleachers, and
i he was the must talked about man in
the field, with the possible exception of
Williams. The score:

| This filled 'em up. Kail sacrificed and
Slohler scooted in. Smith and Frisk
lost no time in rounding the final turn
when Brashear punched a torrid one
past Francks and oucto left field. That
I made four in a row and two more hap
p^red in the fifth.
Frisk was hit by the pitcher and took
third whtrn Hall slammed it out to the
right garden. Ganley picked up the
bal' and lined it to Devereaux. The
was bad and Frisk easily landed
! with the fifth tally. Hall advanced to
third on a wild pitch and arrived when
Moskiman' erred . on Brashear's
grounder.
Moskiman brought in Oakland's
lonely tolly in the same round. Schafly
got a life on Hall's fumble and Lohman
walked. Moskiman drove a peach
through to right field and Schafly easily
beat the throw to the plate, saving a
shutout.
Had Dr. iloskirEan. not allowed his
f t-athers to get rumpled, the fans would
probably have witnessed a close as
well as an interesting exhibition of the
grlorious pastime in the afternoon. But
the doctor felt otherwise than good
natured when the tide of battle began
to turn in favor of the enemy. Conse
quently the northern stars had the con
te.Â«t handed out to them during the pro
gress cf innins three.
Old man Van Haltren -was the first
tatter uj>. With two strikes and three
ba.118 called, he straightway sent that
b&U on a cruise over the fence that
guards the center aeld. The cheering
had' not died away when the doctor
passed Mohier. Then Doc. showed his
tetnptr. Smith bunted an easy one and
the M. D. forgot to pick it up. Frisk
tried the bunt also and was safe, be
cause Moskiman did not feel like
throwing the ball to first after fielding
it.
Oakland \ras lucky and had new
base bsrO grounds to run on while the
sun -was low Is in* heavens. As old sol
began to attain his natural height, the
Seattle tossers began to attain their
natiirsl hittins powers. So It was like
baofc robber>- for them to take a sec
ond parse from Peter's crew. Scores:

HONOLULU, April 10. â Contrary to public
opinion. Governor Carter's Idea of calling the
Hawaiian Legislature Into special session prom
ises to be more successful even than the Gov
ernor himself anticipated. After four days of
work, the two principal bills for salaries and
current expenses have each passed one body
of the Legislature. These two bills slash
about $1,500,000 out of the expenditures -In a
period of twelve months and will, at the end
of the next fixcal year, leave a current debt of
only $550,000 Instead of $1,500,000 as provided
at the laet sesEion of the Legislature.

1TALEXTED YOUNG WOMEN WHO WILI^ BE IN THE CAST THAT WILL, PRE
SENT "HIS ROYAI. NIBS" AT THE ALHAMBRA THEATER FOR THE BENE
FIT OF THE CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S HOSPITAL.
The closing concert of Mme. Schu
mann-Heink drew a large audience to
the Tivoli yesterday afternoon. The
playhouse was filled with as large an
assemblage as is permitted by the fire
ordinance. Mme. Schumann-Helnk has
made a great impression upon the San
Francisco people, who are sorry to see
her leave.
Ethel Levy, the clever singer and
dancer, returned lasf night and every
thing she did was highly appreciated
by those present. They liked her so
much that she was treated to many
calls. The Wilsons and Mademoiselles'
Amorcs and Charlotte, two troups of
acrobatic performers, had new and
novel acts that were well received. The
Mortons were just as popular as ever.
Edmund Day and his company pro
duced their little sketch in good form.
Flo Adler had a few new songs and
the Ellis-Nowlan duo did a very clever
comedy acrobatic act. The' moving
pictures representing the production of
"Faust" was one of the best ever put
on at the popular variety house.
Wilfred Clarke and his company â
Lucille Spinney, Archie GiUes and Theo
Carew, alighted In the midst of the
Orpheum last night with one of those
comedy sketches of the rapid fire va
riety. It is called "No More Trouble,"
and the four people stir up a whole lot
of fun during the half hour the piece
runs. It is one laughable skit after an
other and then the thing ends up sud
denly, so that the crowd does not have
a chance to think about what is com
ing. It was given much applause and
seemed to be one of those pieces that
are manufactured especially for Or
pheum audiences.
"The Greatest Thing In the "World,"
a drama by Harriet Ford and Beatrice
de Mille, was presented last night by
Rose Coghlan and her company at the
California. Concerning itself with a
fascinating mamma, who wades
through four acts of tabulation in a,
highly becoming wardrobe, with
mamma's sOns, and mamma's lovers,
the drama Is of the gloriously uncon
vincing sort. The acting is conspicu
ously In key. Even Rose Coghlan, great
actress as she still is, fails to make
mamma plausible. She wears several
becoming gowns most successfully, de
lights, as usual, with the clearness of
her elocution, but cannot make bricks
out of the very bad straw furnished by
the dramatists. -Her supporting com
pany also carefully abstains from any
thing approaching realism. Fred C.
Houpe, : as the naval qffspring of
mamma, looks as though he were alive
occasionally, Â«o also Sidney Irving, as
the prodigal son. There is a star dog
possessed by Paula Gloy, who is Madge
Chiselhurst, with possibilities but an
impossible voice, but the rest of the
cast Is stuffed, and badly. "The Great
est Thing in the "World" is anything but
the kind of thing usually done by Miss
Coghlan, and were much better left
undone. Â¦ .
Marty O'Neill, a new comedian, made
a hit, and Ben Hassan, also new, did
some clever acrobatic " work. "Hoity-
Toity" is on for the week, and next
week will be the last of the engage
ment.
They're at it againâ the folks that
familiarised San Francisco with Web
erfleldlsm and made Fischer's Theater
famous. - V
The entire grroup of favorites â Kolb
and Dill, Barney Bernard, Maude Am
ber, Wirifleld Blake and Hope and Em
ersonâappeared at the Grand Opera
house last night and played their for
mer roles in "Hoity-Toity" to an audi
ence whose numerical strength was only
limited by the seating capacity and the
anti-standing-room ordinance. ' Hun
dreds of people that sought admission
were turned away in disappointment.
Those 'that got in participated in the
greatest ovation ever tendered to a
company of entertainers in this city.
They banked the stage with floral trib
utes and they howled themselves
hoarse In greeting at each artist's first
entrance. It was a 'reception tremen
dous and spontaneous.
The spirit of the assemblage In front
seemed to cross the footlights and in
spire the actors to work as they never
before worked to please. Consequently
the performance was great on its mer
its. It would have compelled plaudits
and loud laughter even if there had
been no personal predilection to aid it.
The artistry of the principals was en
hanced in effectiveness* by the. efforts
of a big and well-trained chorus of
pretty girls, an augmented orchestra
under the leadership of Harry James, a
wealth of scenic accessories and the in
troduction of some of the latest song
hits. If the same care is bestowed upon
the company's opening performance in
Australia the antipodes will be theirs.
And it is hinted that even a bigger and
better show is in store for the strange
land where there will be no established
favoritism to help the strangers.
