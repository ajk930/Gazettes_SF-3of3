t'Hl!; key of E. has"five sharps,"but with this
chart you may. learn the rhythmic* chorda
as easily as "you did the key of C, which
hasj.neither sharps nor flats. Place the.*
chart "directly cnrer the Iceyboard and at' right
angles to it, so that the small letter D with a dash
above it on the chart is directly over D on the
keyboard. Then the white spaces on the chart will
be over the white keys and black spaces over the
black keys. The top, niiddle and lower sections
on the lower chart represent the three chords, a
mastery of which will enable any one to accom
pany on the piano any song or melody in the key
of E, and the upper chart represents the chorda
of the key of G sharp minor.
The black letters'are to be played with tha
left hand and the colored letters-with the right
hand.* -
The relative of the key of B is the key of G
sharp minor, and its chords, are given in the chart
below to.complete the sixth music lesson in ihi3
series. Now, having placed the chart on the piano
so that the small letter D with a dash above it is
directly over D on the keyboard, play the black
letter on the top section with the left hand and
then the three colored letters in unison with the
right hand; "Next play the middle section in the
same way,: then the lower section, and then re
turn to the top section. The small letter D with
a clash above it which gives the chart-position
must not be played.
The knowledge of the keys and facility in strik
ing the proper chords form the basis of all musical
knowledge.

"Think of the others," he advised,
"and you'Jl regain the balance of your

To think of the others was decidedly
a fjv>od thing. Reason dictated the sur
vey of a widor tleld, the discovery and
recognition of #n average emerging
from the inequalities. The result of
hueh a proc &-. should be either a tem
perate self-satisfaction or a c'.ear
felshted resignation; you would prob
ab'y lind yourself not much above nor
much below the level thus scientifically
ur.nKÂ»nEtra.ted. But the ways of science
are nut always those of the heart, and
that we are. less miserable than, some
people is not a consolation for being
more unhappy than others âleast of
all when the happy are before our eyes

asking nothing so very great, was the
more aggrieved that she was denied
*;ven what she demanded. -. "- ?,,
Kate Ilaymore's day came. Only
Jeremy accompanied the family to
ineet the boat. Kate said they would
want somebody to bustle about after
the luggage. In truth Jeremy seemed
to her already as one of. her own
house. But he did not seem bo to him
self. Eva had been very wayward, full
of adir.iration for Mr. Mallam, and on
the strict defensive against Jeremy's
â i'Pproaehee. He was so distressed and
purzled that he might have comforted
even Christine Fanshaw, and that he
was in fact exceedingly bad company
for anybody. But the party did not
ask for conversation. A stillness fell
on them all as they waited for the boat,
Kate clasping her husband's arm tight
while her eyes were fixed on the ap
proaching ship.
The boy came, down the gangway
and saw them waiting. He was a good
lr-oking young fellow, tall and slim,
v.ith curly hair. Joy and apprehen-
Fion, shame and pride, struggled for
mastery on his face. Kate saw, and
her heart was very full. His fault, his
I'.ight, his banishment, were vivid in
M3 mind. and. to his insight, vivid in
theirs too. But there was something
else that hLs eyes begged them to re
memberâthe struggle to retrieve him
self, the eoo6 record over-seas, the
tliought that they were to be between
ibenÂ». Their letters had breathed no
reproach, and had been full of love. But
letters csnnot give the assurance of
living eyes. He still feared reproach;
he had to beg for love, and to fear
to find it not unimpaired.
"My bcyl" whiskered Kate Ray
mor<? a* she clapped htm lo her arms.
'You'r<Â» looking well, Charley," said
RajTRor^, "but elder. I think."
Yes, he was older; that was part of
the rnce which had fallen to b# paid,
er.d the happiness of reunion could not
nvail nprainst it. His own hand had
overthrown the first glory of his youth:
it had d:c.t not gradually, but by a vio
lent death; the traces were on his face.
There was a touch of awe in Eva's
eyes as she kissed her brotherâthe awe
rvoked by one who had fallen, endured,
and fought. He had to pay the utter
most farthing of his debt.
Yet the joy rose supreme, deeper and
tenderer for the grief behind it, for the
f trucglo by which It was won,- because
it came as a victory after- a -heavy
fight. To Kate It seemed as though he
had suffered for their s-akes as well as
for his own sin, since in Borrow over
him and his banishment their hearts
hnd come closer together, and love
reigned stronger in their home. A
strange remorse struck her and mingled
with her compassion and her gladness
as she held her son at arm's length
end looked again in his eyes. It was
hard to keep tracj; of these things, to
fee how the good and the evil worked,
to understand how no man was unto
himself alone, ana not to accuse of In
justice the way by which one paid for
all. while all sorrowed for one.
As they turned away to the carriage
Eva touched Jeremy on the arm. He
turned to find her smiling, but her lips
trembled.
"If I drive back with them, I shall
cry. and then. I shall look a fright,"
Fhe whispered. "Besides they'd rather
have him to themselves just now. Will
you walk back with me?"*:"
"All right," said Jeremy curtly.
His feelings too had been-touched,
so that bis manner was cool and mat
ter-of-fact almost to aggressiveness.
He preferred to make nothing at all of
walking back with â¢ Eva, though the
way was long, and the- winter sun
r hone over the pea and-the downs, the
wind was fresh and crisp, and youthful
blood went tingling through the veins.
"It's cold driving, anyhow," he added,
as an afterthought.
It was not cold walking, though, or
Jeremy did not eo find it. It was in his
mind that now he had his chance, if he
cou!d find courage to yse it and to force
an issue. For him too Charley and
Charley's sorrow had done something.
They had induced In Eva a softer
rr.ocd; the armor of her coquetry was
pierced by a shaft of deep feeling. As
thev walked she was silent, forgetting
to torment htm. silently glad of his
friendship and his company. She said
nothing of Dora Hutting's good for
tune or of Malism's food looks now.
She was thinking of her mother's faco
as she welcomed Charley, and was
musing on love. It was Jeremy's mo
ment, if he could make use of .it. But
in this rnocd shr> rather frightened him,
raising about herself .defenses different
from .the gleaming' barrier of her co
quetry, yet not less effective. He
feareil lo disturb' her thoughts, and it
see:t;ed to him that his wooing would
be rude and rough.
Suddenly she turned to him.
"You'll be friends with Charley, won't
you? Real friends. I mean? You
won't let what â what's happened stand
in tha way? You sec. he'll be awfully
sensitive about it. and. if he fancies
you're huiglns back, or anything of
tMat kind "
Her eyes were very u,rgent in their
appeal.
"Of course I shall be friends with
him: I shouldn't dream of "
"I'm sure you'll like him for his own
sake, when you know him. And till
then, for mother's sake, for our sake,
you'll be nice to him. 'won't you?"
"Do you care particularly about my
being nice to him?"
"Of pourse l'tlc! ,We're friends, you
see."
Jeremy's fear wore off; excitement
began to rise in him; the spirit of the
same came upon him. He turned to
hi? work. â¢ - ~<:**-'â â¢""';
"Are we friends?" he asked, "louve
not been very friendly lately."
"Nevermind me. Be friendly with
"For our cake, yes."
"I said, for your sake."
A smile dimiiled through Eva's grav
'â¢'Your' is a plural, isn't it?" she
a.sked. . . -- .'.
"Thenâfor thy take?" said Jeremy.
"That's singular, anyhow."
"Oh, for mv sake, then, if vou think
it worth while.'"
"I don't think anything worth while
except pleasing you. Eva. I used to
manage it. I think; but somehow it s
crov.-n more difficult lately."
â Â£ He stopped in his walk and faced her,
She walked on a lace or two, but' he
would r.ot ' follow. Irresolutely she
halted.
"More difficult? Pieasing me grown
more difficult?" *â "$<
S'WeH, pleasing you as much as I
want to. I mean." Jeremy in his. turn
smiled for- a moment; â¢ but he. .was. i'Â»
deadly earnest -asairi as he stepped up
to her and causrht hold of bar hands.
"Xow's the time," he raid. "You've feot
to say yes or no."-. .".,.'
"You haven't askid. me. anything
yet,'.' Â£be murmured, ladghing. her eyea
away from him and her lianas in his.
"Yes, I have, dozens of timesâ dozens
and dozens. And l':n not going to ask
it againâ not in words anyhow. You
know the question."
"It's horribly unfair to â to do this to
dayâto-day, when I'm- "
"Not a bit. To-day's the very day
for it, and that's why you must answer
to-day." A deeper note came into his
words, deeper than he had commanded
when he made love to Dora Hutting on
these same downs not so very long" ago.
"I make love to you to-day because
love's in your heart to-dav. . You're
wanting to love; it's round about us,
Eva." â :'-:Â«;". â 'â¢;"â¢
For an instant she saw in him a like
ness she had never noticed before â a
likeness to Sibylla; Sibylla's ardent all
demanding temper seemed to sp"eak in
his words. â¢ ;-,- ; .
"Yes, this is the dayâ our day. And
this day shall be the beginning or the
end. You know the question. What's
the answer, EVa?"
He let go of her hands, and drew
back two or three paces. He left her
free; if she came to him, it must be of
her own motion.
"How very peremptory you are!" she
protested.
Her cheeks were red now, and the
look of 6orrow had gone out of her
eyes. Her breath came quick, and
when she looked at the sea the waves
seemed to dance to the liveliest music.
At sea and land she looked, at the eky
and at the wintry sun; her glance
touched everywhere save where Jeremy
stood
The answer!" demanded Jeremy,
For a moment more she waited. Then
she came toward him hesitatingly, her
eyes not yet seeking his face. She
came ud to him and stood with her
hands hanging by her side. Then
slowly she raised to- his face the large,
trustiul eyes which he had known and
loved bo well. â  .';:>
"The answer is 'Yes,' Jeremy," she
said. "For all my life and with all my
heart, dear!"
"I knew this was the right day!"
cried- Jeremy. â  - â  .-â¢-â ;' â  -
"Oh, any day was right!" she whis
pered, as she sought his arms.
A couple of hours later he burst into
Grantley Imason's room, declaring
that he was thehanpiest man on earth.
This condition of his, besides being by
no means rare in young men, was not
unexpected, and congratulations met
the obvious needs of the occasion. Si
bylla, who \ wa,s there, was ; not even
very emotional over . the matter: the
remembrance of Dora Hutting inclined
her mind toward the humorous aspectâ
so hard ls.it to appreciate the change
ful processes of t)ther hearts. But Jer
emy himself was [excited enoueh for
everybody, and his excitement carried
him Into forgetfiilness of a solemn
pledge which he had once given. He
wrung Grantley's hand with a vieor at
once embarrassing and painful, crying:
"I owe it all to you! I should never
have dared it except for the partner
ship- that's coming, and that was all
your doing. Without your money- â "
"Damn you, Jeremy!" said Grantley
in a -quiet whisper, rescuing' his hand
and compassionately caressing it with
its uninjured brother.
The imprecation seemed to be eauallv
distributed between Jeremy's two
causes of offense, but Jeremy allocated
it to one only.'
"Oh, good Lord!" he said, 'with a
guilty glance at Sibylla. ;;\
"What money?" asked Sibylla.
She had been sitting by the fire, but
roBe now, and leant her shoulder
against the mantelpiece. ,
Jeremy looked from her to Grantley.
"I'm , most awfully sorry: I forgot
I'm a bit beside myself, you know."
Grantley shrugged his shoulders rather
crossly. "I won't say another word
about it"
"Oh. yes. you will, Jeremy." â¢ ob
served Sibylla with a dangerous look.
"You'll tell me all about it this mo
ment, please." - ' *â¢'.>
"Shall I?" Jeremy turned to Grant
ley again.
"I expect the mischief's donej; now:
but you needn't have lost your memory
or your wits Just because you're Koing
to marry Eva Raymore."
"Marrying does make people lose
their 'wits sometimes." said Sibylla
coldly. Grantley's brows lifted a little
as he. plumped down in a chair with a
resigned air. "Tell me what you mean.
Jeremy." â . '"' a ' " â '.'â¢
"Well. I had to put money into, the
business if I was ever to be more than
a clerk â if I was ever to get a partner
ship, you know."
"And Grantley gave you the money?"
"I'm- going to pay it back whenâ
whenâ â " '
"Yes, of ' course, Jeremy dear. How
much was it?" â 
Grantley lit a cigarette, and came as
near looking uncomfortable as the in
grained composure of his" manner al
lowed. < - ;
"Five thousand," said Jeremy,.
"Wasn't it splendid of him? So you
see, I could afford "
"Five thousand to> Jeremy!" said Si
bylla. She turned on Grantley. i"And
how much to John Fanshaw?"
"You women are all traitors. Chris
tine had no business to say a word." It
was pure business; he pays me back
regularly. ;And; Jeremy's Kolnsr.to.pay
me back, too. Come, I haven't done any
harm to either of them." : 'â ' ' â 
"No, not- to them," she said. And
she added to Jeremy: "Go and tell
Christine." She'll be delighted to hear
about you and Eva."
"By Jove,: I will! I say, I'm really
sorry,' Grantley."
"Youought to be. No, you may do
anything except shake my hand a^ain."
"I can't help being so dashed jolly,
you know."
With that apology he darted out of
the room, forgetting his, broken pledge,
intent onjy on finding other ears to
hear his wonderful news. . . ~ i

asked Grantley. . . "I think they.'ll get

"Please don't make talk, Grantley.
When did you give him that money?"
"I don't remember."
"There are bank-books; and so on,
aren't there?" :
'"How businesslike you're getting!"
"Tell me when, please!!' .- \-
Grantley. rose and stood opposite to
her, even as they had stood in the
inn â at the Sailors'. Rest at Fairhaven.

' "I wouldn't part with the pleasure
of having it against you â or nursing it
against. you secretly. I want you to
understand the truth. Are you very
angry?"
Sibylla appeared to be angry; there
was a dush of red. on her cheeks.
"Yes, I'm ungxy," she said; "and
I've a right to be angry. You're good

"It was done in malice against youâ
and: in a petty malice, I think now,
though 1 didn't, think that then."
"Doing it was no malice tome, You
did; it in love of me!" Her words
were a challenge to him to deny; and,
looking at her, he could not deny.
He had never denied his love for her,
and he would not now. "The" wrong
you did me was not in doing it, but
in not telling me; yes ( not telling me

than Klchard does." , .. ;
"Young Walter has a way with
him," smiled Caylesham.
"I hope we shan't get into opposite
camps and quarrel. - Kichard and I
have been such good friends lately.
And then, of course " She hesi
tated a little. "Of course there may be
a slight awkwardness here and there."
Caylesham understood the covert al
lusion; the marriage might make mat
ters difficult with 'the Im,asons.
"The young folks will probably
make their own friends. Our old set's
rather broken up one way and the
other, isn't it? .Not .that I was ever
a full member of it.".;
"We've always been glad to see
you,-' she murmured absently.
"On the .whole I feel equal to en

he said, standing , before the fire.
"Anna will be angry pretty often, but'
I don't think* she will be, or need be,
unhappy. She doesn't take things to
heart too readily, does she?" *-".%->
"No, she doesn't."

praise of her daughter. * . -

dulge him a little â let the string out
a little here and there; but she'll al

do count, and she's got them all. And
she won't, expect romance all the

"Of -course you don't understand
the feeling of responsibility, the fear
that if she's, the â the least bit hard,
it may be because of her bringing up."
"Don't be remorseful. Mrs. Selford.
It's the most unprofitable of emotions."
He had preached' the same 'doctrine
to Christine.
"When it's too late to go back?"
."And that's always." .He looked
down at her with a cheerful smile.
"That's for your private ear. Don't
tell, the children. Walter Blake's quite
great on remorse."
: Mrs.- Selford laughed rather - rue
fully; 'â : â¢* - -'â â â  â .â ;::. â ;,'â¢ -

"Very hard to say. One Isn't be
hind the scenes. But I'm inclined to
think I do. Oh, ecstasies aren't for
this* world, you know â not perma
nent ecstasies. You might as well
have permanent hysterics! And, as
you're aware, there are no marriages
in heaven. So perhaps there's no
heaven in marriages, either. That
would seem to be plausible reasoning,
wouldn't it? But they'll be all right;
They'll learn one another's paces/'
- "I. "â¢ can't" help wishing she seemed
more in' love."
"Perhaps she will be when he flirts
with somebody else. Don't frown.
I'm not a pessimist. If I don't always
look for happiness by the ordinary
roads, I often discern it along quite
unexpected routes."
"It's pleasant to see people start by
bcing 4 in love."
"How eternally sentimental we are!
Well, yes, it is. But capacities differ. I
daresay she doesn't know she's deficient
and she certainly won't imagine that
her mother has given her away.
"I suppose I deserve tnat, but I had
to talk to somebody. And really It's
best to choose a man; sometimes It
stops there then." â¢
"Why not your husband? No? Ah,
he has too many opportunities of re
minding you of the indiscretion! You
were quite right to talk to" me. We
shall look on at what happens with
all the greater Interest because we've
discussed it. ' And, as I've .said, I'm
decidedly hopeful."
"We might have developed her affec
tions when she was a child. I'm sure
we might."
"Oh, ;i shall go! You send for a
clergyman!" ' J
Mrs. Selford shook her head sadly,
even while she smiled. She could not
â be-besuiled from her idea, nor from
the remorse that it brought. The pic
ture, the dogs, and sentimental squab
bling with her husband had figured too
largely In the household; she connected
with this fact the disposition which
she found in Anna.
:*'B'ing a bit hard isn't a bad thing
for your happiness," Caylesham added
as a last consolation.
' Anna herself came in. No conscious
ness of deficiency seemed to afflict her;
Bhe felt no need of a development of
her affections or of being more in lova
with Walter Blake. On the contrary,
she . exhibited to Caylesham's shrewd
eyes a* remarkable picture of efficiency
and of contentment.' She had known
: what , she wanted, -; she had * discerned
what means to use In order to â  get It,
and she had achieved it. A perfect self
confidence', assured * her, that she would
be successful in" dealing with it; her
serene air, : her trim figure and decisive
movements gave the impression that
here at least" was a mortal- who If 'she
did not deserve success could command
it. Caylesham looked on her with ad
mirationârather that than likingâ as
he acknowledged her very considerable
qualities.' The thins which was want
ing was what In a picture he would
have called : "atmosphere." But here
again her luck came in, or, rather, her
clear vision;' it- was not fair to call it
luck. â  The man she â¢ had < pitched upon
âthat was fair, arid . Caylesham de
clined to withdraw the expression â at
the time when she pitched upon him.
was In a panic about. "atmosphere." He
had found too much of it elsewhere and
was uneasy about it in himself. He
was not asking- for -softness, for ten
derness, for ready accessibility to emo
tion or to waves of feeling. Her clever
ness had turned to account even the
drawback â  which made Caylesham, In
the : midst of his commendation, con
scious that he would not choose to be
her husband â or, perhaps, her son
either. .
"You'll make a splendid head of the
family," he told her cheerfully. "You'll
keep them all In most excellent order "
She chose to consider, that he had ex
ercised a bad , Influence aver Walter
Blake, and treated him distantly. Cay-
' lesham supported the entire injustice
of her implied charge with good humor.
"You're not fond of excellent order, I
suppose?" she asked.
"In others," said he, smiling:, "Hay
I come and see it in your, house some
times? I. promise not to disturb it."
"I don't think you could."
"She taunts me with my advancing
years," he complained to Mrs. Selfordl
Anna's disapproval of him was mark
ed; it increased his amusement at tha
life which lay before Walter Blake.
Blake would want to disturb excellent
order, sometimes; he would bÂ© Indulged
in that proclivity to a strictly limited
extent. If Grantley Imason were a
revengeful man, this marriage ought to
cause him a great deal of pleasure.
Caylesham, while compelled to approve
by his reason, could not nelp deploring
in his heart. He saw arising an ultra-
British household, clad in the very
buckram of propriety. "Who could say
that morality did not reign in tba
world -when such a nemesis as this
awaited Walter Blake, or that morality
had -not a humor of its own when Wal
ter Blake accepted me nemesis with
enthusiasm? Yet the state of things
was not unusual â a fair sample of a
bulk of considerable size. Caylesham
went away smiling at it, wondering at
it, in the depths of his soul a trifle ap
palled at it. It seemed to him rather
inhuman; but perhaps his idea of hu
manity had gone a trifle far In the op
posite direction.
And, after all, could not Walter Blaka
supply the other element? There was
plenty of softness about nim, and tha
waves of feeling were by no means
wanting in frequency or volume. Con
sidering this question. Caylesham pro
fessed himself rather at a loss. Ha
would have to wait and look on. But
would he hear or see much? Anna had
evidently put him under a ban, and he
believed that her edicts would obtain
obedience in the future. So far as ha
could see now. he had a vision of the
waves stilled to rest, of the gleam of
frost forming upon them, of an ice
bound sea. Now he felt it in his heart
to be sorry for young Blake. Not be
cause there was any injustice. The-
Nemesis was eminently, and even lu
dicrously. Just. He felt sorry precisely
because it was so Just. He was always
sorry for sinners who had to pay the
penalty of their deeds; then a fellow
feeling went out to- them. Of course
they were fools to grumble. The one
wisdom he claimed for himself was not
grumbling at the bilL
He paid another visit that day, un
der an impulse of friendliness, and per
haps of curiosity, too. He went to Tom
Courtland's, and found himself repaid
for his trouble by Tom's cordiality of
greeting. The Courtland family was
in the turmoil of moving; they had to
go to a much smaller house and to
reduce the establishment greatly. But
the worries of a move and the prospect
of comparative poverty â there was very
little left besides Harriet's moderate
dowryâ were accepted by Tom very
cheerfully, and r by the children . with
glee; they were' delighted to be told
that there would be no more:men ser
vants and fewer maids, and that they
would have to learn to shift for them
selves as much and as soon aa possible.
They were glad to be rid of "thi3- great
gloomy house," over which the shadow
of calamity still brooded.
"The children don't like to pass Lady
Harriet's door at night," Suzette whis
pered in an aside to Caylesham.
Tom himself seemed younger; and
more sprightly; and he was the slave
of his little girls. His gray hair, the
lines on his face, and the enduring scar
on Sophy's brow spoke of the sorrow
which had 'been; but' the sorrow had
given place to peace â and it might be
that some day peace would turn to joy.
For there was much youth there, and.
where youth is, Joy must come, if only
4t be given a fair chance.
"We're rather In narrow circum
stances, of course," Tom explained,
when Suzette and the children were out
of earshot. "That's because I made
such an ass of myself."
"Well, don't be hard on Flora. Shs
was a good friend to you."
"I'm not blaming her; it's myself.
Frank. I ought' to have remembered
the children. But we can rub along,
and perhaps I shall get a berth some
day." â 
Caylesham did not think that pros
pect a very probable one, but he dis
sembled and told Tom that his old po
litical friends ought certainly to do
something for him: "
"Because it never came to an abaolct s
public row, did It?"
"Everybody knew," sighed Tom, with,
a relapse into despondency.
"Anyhow you won't starve." Cayle
sham said with a laugh. . "I- reckon yon
must have about a thousand a year?"
"It's not much: butâ well, I tell you.
what, Frank, Suzette Bligh's pretty
nearly as good as another five hundred,
and I only pay her seventy pounds a
year. You wouldn't believe what a
manager that little woman .Is. She
makes everything go twice as far as. It
did, and has the house so neat. too.
Upon my soul. I don't notice any dif
ference, except that I've dropped my
champagne."
"Well, with champagne what it most
ly. Is nowadays, that's no great loss.
my boy, and I'm glad you've struck It
rich with Miss Bllgh." Bttjgg
"We should be lost without her. I
don't know what the children would do.
or what I should do with them. -but for
her. One good thing poor Harriet did,
anyhow, was to bring her here."
Yes; but if Harriet tad known how
It was to fall out, had foreseen how
Suzette was to reign tn her stead, and
with what joy the change of govern*
ment would be greeted! Caylesham
imagined, with a conscious faintness of
fancy, the tempest which would have
arisen, and how short a shrift "would
have been meted out to Suzette and all
her adherents. He really hoped that
poor Harriet, who had suffered enough
for her faults, was not in any position
In which she could be aware of what
had happened; it would be to her (un
less some great transformation had
been wrought) too hard and unendura
ble a punishment. â¢
"The children are changed creatures,
Frank." Tom went on. "We don't try
to repress them, you know. That
would be hypocrisy, wouldn't It, tinder
the circumstances? The best thing la
for them to forget. Suzette says so,
and I quite agree."
Suzette, it seemed, could achieve an
epitaph of stinging quality â quite
without meaning It, of course. Cayle
sham agreed that the best thing the
girls could do was to forget their
mother.
â¢ "So we let them make a row, and
they're to go out - of mourning very
soon. That's what Suzette advises." -
A merciful Providence must span*
poor Harriet this! She was to be for
gotten â almost by a violent process of
obliteration: and thl3 bv Suzette's de

fond of thinking about myself," said
Tcm Courtland, rubbing his bristly
hair. "But the worst of it's over now.
There s peace anyhow, Frank, and at
least the children were always fond of
me.
"You're going to get along first-rate."
Cajiesham assured him. "And mind
you make Miss Suzette stick to you.
fcrfie s a rare woman: I can see that.*"
"lou're a good chap, t^ank. You

"Much less trouble than dropping

"Ccin't some of the minor virtues 1
should be hardly human, should I?
They're just as essential as the minor
vices."
If you ever see Flora tell herâ well,
you'll know what to tell her."
"I'll say something kind. Good -by.
Tom. I'm glad to find you so cheerful."
â¢The girls came round him to say
gjod-by. He kissed them and gave
. each of them half a crown. Ke used to
explain that he always tir>r>ed children
because in after years he was thus
n;ade. sure of finding somebody to de
fend his character in pretty nearly any
company. Since, however, this was ab
solutely the only step he ever took
with 2.ny such end in view, the expla
nation was often received with skepti
cism. Kis action was more probably the
outcome of ore of his minor virtues.
'"How kind you are to children! What
a 'pity you're ii bachelor!" smiled Su
"Thanks! I don't often get such a
testimonial." he said, risking a whimsi
cal life of his brow6 for Tom Court
land's eye.
He had just been seeking impression?
of marriage. Chance gave him- one
â¢ more than he had looked for or desired.
Just outside Tom Courtland's, as he
was going away, he ran plump intc
"John Kanshaw, who was making for
the house. There was no avoiding him
â¢this time. The men had not met since
.Caylesham lent John money and John
learned from Harriet Courtland the
truth of what the man from whom he
took the naone;- had done. Dut there
. had been no rupture between them.
Civil notes had been written â on John's
; elde even sratefu! notes â as the busi
ness transaction between them â  neces
sitated. And both had a part to playâ
the same part, the part of ignorance.
Caylesham must play it for Christine.
John had to assume it on his own ac
count, for his own self-respect. The
last shred Â«jf his pride hung on the as
sumption that, though he knew, and
â¢ though Christine was aware of his
knowledge. Caylesham at least believed
him ignorant.
But heavy John Fanshaw was a clum
sy hand at make-believe. Kis cordiality
was. hesitating, fumbling, obviously in
sincere: his unhappiness in his part
very apparent. C&yScsfcam cut short his
effort * to express gratitude, saying.
"You shall do anything in the world ex
cept thank me!" and went on to ask
after Christine ia the most natural
manner in the world.
"She's been a littleâ a little seedy,
end hils gx'ne <jo\vn to stay with the
Imasoas for a bit," John explained,
taking care not to look at Caylesham.
"Uh. I hope she'll be all right soon!
Give her my remembrances when you
write â or perhaps you'll be running
down sucn?" , m.
"I don't know. It depends on busi-
: < Come. you'll take Christmas off,
anyhow?"
The:i John tc-ok refuge in talking
ab.^ut Tom Courtland. But his mind
was far from Tcm. He managed at
last to look Cayk-shum in the face,
and grev.- more smaztd at his perfect
case and composure. He T .vas actually
conscious tit giving exactly the opposite
Impression himstlf, acutely fearful that
he was betraying that hidden knowl
â .edce of his. Actuated by this fear he
! tried to increase his cordiality, hitting
â¢wildly Â«t the mark and indulging in
forced friendliness and tven forced
jocosity. * . :..'..! '- â 
Caylesham met evei-y effort with just
the right Lcse, precisely the right
amount of effusiveness. He had taken
a very hard view of what John had
done â harder than he Â«.-ould contrive
to take of what he himself had â and
had expressed it vigorously to Chris
line. But now he found himself full of
pily for poor John. The sight of the
man lighting for the remnant of his
pride and self-respect was pathetic.
And John did it so lamentably ill.
"You're a paragon of a debtor," <^ay
letham told him. when 1 e harked back
to the money again. "My money's a
deal safer in your hands than in my
own. I'm more in yc-ur debt than you
are in mine."
"You rhall have every farthing the
firrt day I can manage it."
. His eagerness told Caylesham what a
burden on his soul me indebtedness
wa.v. It was Impossible to ignore alto
gether what v/as so plainly shown;
but he turned the point of it. saying:
"I know how punctilious you m n of
â¢ business aie. I wish fellows were al
" ways the sawe in racing! I'm ready to
tike it as soon as you're ready to pay,
and to wait till you're ready."
"I shan't ask you to we t - cay,"
John assured him.
Enough had passed fcr civility; Cay*
. lcsham trata taper t-j get away â not for
his own sake so much as for John's.
"liy Jcve, I've got an appointment!"
he exclaimed suddenly, diving for his
â¢na'ca. "Half-past six! Oh. I must
jump into a cab!' He l.eld the watch
in one lined ard hailed a cab with his
, stick. "Good by. old fellow." he raid
] turning away. He had seen John put
x.-vt his hand in a hesitating reluctant
way. He would have IHred to shake
/hands himself, but he knew John hated
to do it. John mi^e a last demonstra
tion of ignorance,
"Come and see us some day," he
csilrd almost jovially. \*.
-â¢Yes. I will come day before long."
â¢ Cayltuham shouted back from the step
of his hansom.
As he drove off John was still Etand
ing on the pavement, waving a hand
to him. Caylesham drove round the
torner. then got down again, and pur>
guetl his way <.-n foot.
He was quite cJcar in his own mind
that John took the thing unnecessarily
hard, but he was genuinely sorry -that
John should to take it. Indeed, John's
distress raised an unusually acute
sense of discomfort in him. Nor could
he take any pride in the tact with
which he himself had steered the course
Â«>f the interview. He could not avoid
. the conclusion that to John he must
have seemed a bypucrlte more accom
plished that one would wish to be con
sidered in the arts of hypocrisy. He
had hitherto managed so well that
he hud not been forced into such sit
uations; he had been obliged to lie
only in his actions, and had not come
so near having to lie in explicit wc-Ms.
He did not like the experience and
shook his head impatiently as he walk
ed along. It occurred to him that
since marriage was in its own nature
so difficult and risky a thing as he had
already decided it was hardly fair for
third persons to steiÂ» in and compli
cate It more. He had to get at any
state of mind resembling penitence by
roads cf his own; the* ordinary ap
proaches were overgrown and impass
ible from neglect. But In view
of John's distress and of "the pain
which had come on Christine, and on a
realization of the unpleasant' perfec
tion of art which he himself had been
compelled (and able) to exhibit, he
achieved the impression that he had
better have left such things alone â
well, at any rate where honest old
duffers like John Fanshaw were in
volved in the case.
â¢ Having pot so far, he might not un
naturally have considered whether he
should remodel his way of life. But
he was not the man to suffer a sud
den conversion under the stress of emo
tion cr of a particular impression. His
unsparing clearness of vision and hon
esty of Intellect forbade that. -
*'I 6hall get better when I'm too old
for anything else." he told himself with
a rather bitter smile. '-'I suppose I
oupht to thank God that the time's
not far c-ff now."
It was not much of an effort in the
way of that unprofitable emotion
agai_st which he had warned Christine
Fanshaw and Janet Selford; but it was
enough to make him take a rather dif
ferent view, if not c-f himself, at least
of old John Fanshaw. He decided that
he had been too hard on John: and at
the back of his mind was a notion that
he had been rather hard on Christine,
too. In this case It seemed to him that
he was getting off too che-ply. John
and Christine were paying all the blil
â at least a disproportionate amount.
The upshot of it all was expressed in
his exclamation:
"I don't want the money. I wish to
heaven old John wouldn't pay me
back!"
He would have felt easier for a little
mere demerit Jn John. It is probable,
though his philosophising did not lead
him so far as this conclusion, that he,
too, was a sample, and from a bulk
not inconsiderable in quantity. Where
it is possible we prefer that the people
we have injured should turn out to
have deserved injury from somebody.
CHAPTER XXVIII.
To Life and Light Again!
It was the eve of Dora Hutting's
wedding â a thing in itself quite enough
to put MilJdean into an unwonted stir.
Everybody was very excited about the;
event and very sympathetic. Kate
Raymore had come to the front; not
even p'reoccunation with Charley could
prevent a marriage from interesting
her. She had given much counsel and
had exerted herself to erlect a recon
ciliation between the bride and Jeremy
Chiddingfc-rd. Into this diplomatic ef
fort Sibylla also had been drawn, and
peace had been signed at a lea party.
With the help of Chi istir.e's accom
plished manner and Grantley'a tactful
composure it had beer, found possible
to treat the whole episode- Â£.s a boy
aud-girl affair which could be laughed
at and thus dismissed into oblivion.
The tv.c- principals could rot take quite
this view: but they consented to be
friends, to wish each other well, and
to pay nothing about the underlying
contempt which each coujd not but
entertain for the other's fickleness. For
Jeremy would have been faithful if
Dora had been, and Dora co-uid not
perceive how the fact of her having
made a mistake as to her own feelings
explained the extraordinary rapidity
with which Jeremy had been able to
transfer an affection professedly so
lasting ard so deep. Christine warned
her that all men were like that â except
Mr. Mallam; and Grantley told Jeremy
that Dora was flighty, as all girls were?
â except Eva â  Rayncve. So peace,
though not very cordial peace, was ob
tained, the satirical remarks which the
parties felt entitled to maKe privately
not appearing on the face of the for
mal proceedings.
Important though these matters
might be they wer*e net In Sibylla's
mind as she stood at the end of the
garden and looked down on Old Mill
House. Twenty-four hours before Mrs.
Mumples had started on -her journey.
Sibylla. Eva and Jeremy had escorted
her to Fairhaven. The fat old wc-man
was very apprehensive and tremulous;
anxious about her looks and the tit
of her new silk gown: full of question
ings about the meeting to which she
went. It was imp,or.sib!e not to smile
covertly at tome of these manifesta
tions, but over them all shone the
beauty cf the love which had sustained
her through the years. Sibylla prayed
that now it might hav? . its reward,
half wondering that it had lived to
claim it â had lived so long in solitude
and uncomforted. It had never des
paired, however long the waiting, how
ever much it was starved of all satis
faction, bereft of all pleasure, con
demned to teeming uselessness. even
unwelcomcd, as Â» ne well might fear.
These things had brought pain and
fear, but net despair nor death. Yet
Mrs. Mumple was not by nature a pa
tient wc-man; naturally she craved a
full return for what she gave, and an
ardent answer to the warmth of her
affection. None the less she had not
despaired; and as Sibylla thought of
this she accused herself because, un
like the old woman she had allowed
herself to despairâ nay, had been ready,
almost eager^ to do it. haa twisted
everything into- a justification for it.
had made no protest against it and no
effort to avoid it. That mood .had led
to ruin; at last she saw that it would
have been ruin. Was there now hope?
It was difficult to go back, to retrace
the steps â¢so- confidently taken, to real
ize that she, too. had been wrong.
Yet what else was the lesson? It
came to her in one foim or another
from every side â from the Courtlands,
where death alone had been strong
enough to thwart the evil fate; from
the Raymores, where trust, bruised,
bui not broken, had redeemed a boy's
life from evil to good; even from Chris
tine, who waited in secret hope; above
all, from the quarter whence she had
least looked for it â from Grantley him
self, for whom no effort vÂ»as too great,
who never lost confidence, who had in
deed lacked understanding, but had
never lacked courage: who now, with
eyes opened and at her bidding, was
endeavoring the hardest thing a man
can doâ was tr:.-ing to change himself,
to look at himself with another's eyes,
to remodel himself by a new standard,
to count as faults what he had cher
ished as virtues, to put in th^ fore
most place, not the qualities which
had been his pets, his favorites, his
ideals, but those which another asked
from him. and which he must do him
self a vio-lence to display. Had she no
corresponding effort to make? She
could not deny the accusation. It lay
w'.th her also to try. But it was hard.
John Fanshaw found it sorely diffi
cult, grossly against his prejudices, and
even in conflict with principles which
he held sacred, to belittle his grievance
or to let ft'gb. ' Sibylla was. very fond
of her grievances, too. She was asked
to look at them with new eyes, to think
of them no more as outrages, as stones
of stumbling and rocks of offense. She
was asked to consider, her grievances
as opportunities. That was the plain
truth about it, and it involved so much
recantation, such a turning upside down
of old notions, such a fall for pride. It
was very hard to swallow. Yet unless
It were swallowed, where was hope?
And if it were swallowed; what did it
mean? An experiment â only another
difficult experiment. For'^people are
not changed readily, and cannot be
changed altogether. Difficulties would
remainâ wquld remain always; the vain
ideal whlcli had once governed all her
acts and thoughts would never be real
ized. She must not be under any de
lusion as to that. â¢
She turned to find Grantley beside
her, and he gave her a telegram ad
dressed to her. She opened it with a
word of thanks.
"From John Fanshaw!" she exclaim
ed eagerly. "He's cooling down here
to-night!"
"Well, you told him to wire -when
ever he found Mfe could get down, didn't
you?"
"Yes, of course. But â but what does
it mean?"
He smiled at her. .
"I'm not surprised. Christine had a
letter from him this morning. I saw
the handwriting. I'm taking a very
sympathetic interest in Christine, so
I look at the handwriting on her let
ters. And she's been in a state of sup
pressed excitement all the morning.
I've noticed that â with a sympathetic
interest. Sibylla."
i "I think I ought to go and see her."
"Not just yet, please! Oh, yes, I hope
it'll be a good day for her! And it'll
be a great day for your poor c-ld Mum
ples, won't it? I hope Mr. Mumple will
behave nicely."
"Oh, so do I, with my whole heart!"
cried Sibylla.
"I'm taking a very sympathetic inter
est in the Mumples also, Sibylla, Like
wise in Dora and her young man, and
Jeremy and his young woman. Oh. and
iii the Ray mores and Charley! Anybody
else?" "â â¢:-â 'â ::!;','.-
Sibylla leoked at him reprovingly,
but a smile would tremble about the
corners of her mouth.
"You see, I've been thinking, over
what you said the other day." Grantley
went on with placid gravity, "and I've
made up my mind to come and tell you
â¢whenever 1 do a decent thing or have

love â or acknowledged it, for in truth it
was siven â she abandoned all the
claims, the grievances, the Wrongs," all
that had been the basis of what she
had done. She took Grantley on faith
again,, she put herself into his hands,
again she made the greatÂ»venture with
all its possibilities. She had seemed
wrong once. Wculd she seem wrong
again?
There was a change in him; that she
believed. Was there a change, too, in
her? Unless there were she did not
dare to venture. Had all that she had
suffered, all that she ha.d seen others
suffer/brought nothing to her? . Yes,
there was something. When you loved
you must unaerstand, and, knowing
the truth, love that or 'leave- it. You
must not make an image and love that,

that.~ You must -love or leave the true

thing. Ana. to do that there is needed
another surrender of your point - of
view, your own ideas c-f what you are
and how you ought to be treated. To
get great things you must barter great
things in return. There are seldom
cheap bargains to be had in costly
goc-ds. Had not Grantley learnt that?
Could not : she? It took generosity to
learn it. Was ..she less generous than
Grantley? The question hit her like a
blow. If Grantley had done, as she
had, would she still have loved? would
she have come again to seek and to
woo? Ah, but the case was not truly
parallel! Grantley soughtleave to reign
againâ to reign by her will,' but still
to reign.- That was not what was
asked.of her. ...-â¢>
Was It not? Eagerly stretching out
after truth, seeking the bedrock of deep
truth, ' her- mind spurred . by its need,
soared above -these, distinctions, and
saw, as in a vision, the union of these
transient oppbsites. Was not to reign
well to serve well, was not faithfully to
obey the order of the universe to be a

The clock of the old church struck
five and on the sound a cab appeared
over the crest of the opposite hllL Sib
ylla, with Frank in her arms, watched
Its descent to Milldean, and then went
into the house to put on her hat. In
view of the ancient love between her
and Mumples it was ner privilege to
be the first to' greet the returned wan
derer. For all her sympathy Kate Ray
more was a friend of too recent stand
ing â sh* had not witnessed the years of
waiting. Jeremy's affection was true
enough, but Mumples feared the di
rectness of his tongue ajid the exub
erence of his spirits. Highly conscious
of the honor done to hear, somewhat
alarmed at the threatened appeal to her
ever too ready emotion, Sibylla went
down the hill. ::V-
A pale, v frail old student, with the
hands c-f a laboring man â thai was her
first impression of Mumples' husband.
He had the air of remoteness from the
world and of having done with the
storms of life which come to men who
have lived many years in a library;
his face was lined, but his eyes calm
and placid. Only those incongruous
hands with their marks of toil hinted
at the true story. He spoke in a low
voice, as though it might be an offense
to speak loud; his tones were' refined
and his manner respectful and rather
formal. It was evidently unsafe to
make, any parade of sympathy with
Mumplesâ she was near breaking
point: but the exchange of a' glance,
on which Sibylla ventured, showed that
her agitation was of joy and satisfac
tion. Evidently the meeting had dis
appointed the worst of her fears and
confirmed the dearest of her hopes.
"I have to thank you, Madame," the
old man said, "for the great kindness
you and your family have shown to
my wife during my absence." '^ ;
"We owe her far more* than she owes
us. I don't know what we should have
done without her."
"The knowledge that she had good
friends did much to enable me to en
dure my^absence." he went on. "She's
loo-king well, is she not. Madame? She
appears to me less changed than I had
thought possible.",
Sibylla could not resist another quick
glance at Mumples.
"And I haven't seen her for ten
years.",.
He paused and looked at Sibylla in a
questioning way.
"Don't worry any more about that.
Luke," said Mrs. Mumple. with her
hand on his shoulder. "You knew what
suited you best. What was the good
of my coming if it wasn't to be a com
fort to you?"
"It was selfish of me. Madame; but
you've no idea what it is to be in â
in such circumstances as I was. I've
been unfortunately a man of quick tem
per and I ec-aldn't trust myself in all
cases. I got beside myself if I was re
minded of the outside world â of all I
was losing â how the years went byâ
of my wife and the home and the life
I might have had. It was because I
loved her that I wouldn't see her "
"Yes, yes. I'm sure of that," said Sib
ylla, hastily. , *â¢><â¢
"But it was selfish, as love sometimes
is, Madame. 1 ought to have put her
first And I never thought what it
would mean to- her when I did what
brought me to that p:ace. Well, I've
paid for it with my life. They've taken
my life from me."
."You've- many years before you,
dear," whispered Mrs. Mumple.
"I have so few behind me," he said.
"They've blotted o-ut two-thirds of my
life. Looking back on it now I can't
see it as it was. It seems long, but very
empty â a great vacant space in, my life,
Madame."
"Ah. but you've your home and your
dear wife now â and we shall all be
your, friends."
Hov,- dull and cold her words seemed!
Yet, what else was there to say in face
of the tragedy^
"I'm deeply grateful to her and to
heaven; but Iâ I have nothing left. It
seems to me that the years have taken
everything."
Mrs. Mumple put her hand down to
his worn hand and caressed it.
"You'll be better by and by, dear,"
she said. .--<;
"I'm deadened." he persisted sadly.
"Don't feel like that," Sibylla im
plored.' "Your life will come back to
you in the sunshine and the country
air. We shan't let you feel like that.
Why. it's full of IKe here. There's a
wedding to-morrow, Mr. Mumple! And
another .engaged couple â my brother
and Miss Kaymorc! And you'll like my
husband and I'll bring my baby boy
to see you."
"Such a pretty little dear!" exclaimed
Mumples.
"You must take an Interest in us,"
smiled Sibylla; "and then you'll be
pleased v.hen we are â won't he, Mum
ples? Because you're to be one of us,
just as your wife is."
Mrs. Mumples suddenly turned away
and murmuring something about get
ting tea escaped from the- room. The
old man fixed his eyes on Sibylla's face
in a long inquiring gaze.
"You say that to nje, Madame? I
don't deserve to- have that said to me.
You're a beautiful young lady and very
kind, I kno\y, and good, I'm sure. Your
husband is lucky, and so Is your son.
But I've been a convict for seventeen
years, and it's only by a chance that
I'm not a. murderer. I'm not fit to
co-me near you or yoursâ no, not near
your little boy."
Sibylla came to him and took his
work worn hand. He saw .that she
meant to kiss it and held it back.
"A convict and In heart a murderer.
Madame," he said, his lips trembling 1
a little and his calm eyes very sad.
"I'm not fit for you to touch."
"I'll tell you something," said Sibylla.
"You call me kind and good â you say
my-husband and my boy are lucky, and
you tell . me you're not fit for me to
touch â forrne to touch! I tried to run
away from my husband, and I was
ready to leave my little boy to his
death."
A great wonder came into the old
man's eyes; he : asked no question, but
he ceased /to resist her persuading
grasp.- She raised his hand to her lips
and kissed it. ..
*;l thought my heart was dead, as
you think yours Is. But light and life
have eonie" back into mine, .and you
mustn't shut yours against them. You
must try to be happy. If it's only for
dear old Mumples" sake. She's thought
of "nothing but making you' happy all
these years.". Shft laid, her hand on his
shoulder. "And love us too. For my
husband's and my boy's sake keep the
secret; I've told you, but remember It
when you feel despairing. It wasn't
easy for me â¢ to speak of it, but I
thought it would give you hope; and it
will prevent you feeling the sort of
thing ; you have felt about me, and I
hope about any of us."
He turned his eyes to" hers.
"You're telling me the truth, I know,
Madame." he said slowly, -'it's a very
strange world. I'll try. not to despair."
"No, no, don't despair; above all,
don't despair,"- whispered' Sibylla.
. "I have a remnant of my days, and I
have the love of my wife. God has
left me something out of the wreck that
I've made."
Sibylla stooped and kissed him on the
brow. He caught her. hands and look
ed again in her eyes for. a long time.
"It i3 true? And. your eyes are like
theÂ»eyes of an angel!"
He relaxed his hold on ttfcr and sank
back in his chair with a sigh.
"I'm tiring you," said Sibylla. "I'll
go now," and leave you alone with Mum.
pies.- I'll call her back here.. No, I
can't stay to tea â you've made, me
think of too much. But I'll come to
morrow, and bring my little boy."*
"If what you say is true you must
pray for yourself sometimes? Pray for
me. too, Madame."'
"Yes, I'll pray for yt-u tne prayer I
love best: Those things which for our
unworthiness we dare not and for our
blindness we cannot ask â * I will pray
for those, for you and , for me. And
because you're an c-ld man and have
suffered, you shall" give me your bless
ing before I go."
She knelt to receive his trembling
benediction, then rose \ with a glad
smile on her face. She sjw Mumples
standing now on the threshold 6f the
room and kissed her hand to her.
"The eld is done and the new. is be
gun." she said to the o;g roan as she
pressed his hand in farewell.
She walked slowly up the hill in the
peaceful dusk. Lights Durned In the
church; the village choir was laborious
ly practicing an ambitious effort for
the next day. â¢ There were lights in the
windows over the postofnee; one was
open to the mild evening air and Jere
my's vc-ice in a love ballad competed
enviously with the choir's more pious
strains, till it was drowned in a merry
protest of youthful shouts. When she
reached home there was a light In thÂ«
nursery and the nurse was singing
softly to the little boy. Her agitation
was past, her emotion was gentle mm,
and her face peacefully radiant. Her
grievances seemed small beside the old
man's suffering, her woes nothing be
side his punishment, her return to lifÂ»
and light so much easier than his. Ha
had but a remnant of life leftâ the rest
had been demanded of him in ransom
for his deed and the ransom had been
exacted to the uttermost farthing. He
was poor, though not destitute; but
she was rich. Her life lay still -before
her with all its meaning and its possi
bilities â its work and its struggles, its
successes and its failures, the winning
of more victories, the effort and tlje
resolve not to lose what had been so
hardly won. Sc-berly she looked for
ward to it. assessing and measuring
her strength and weakness and the
strength and weakness of those with
whom her life was cast. She had no
more of the blind and reckless confi
dence of her firsUessay; her eyes were
open. Her knowledge did not forbid
her soul reaching c-ut to the Joy that
was to come, but it whispered that the
joy was not all. and that the Joy must
be fa5rly won. Yet she welcomed the
joy with the innate ardor of her mind,
exultant that nov.- she might take it.
that now it could prove ntÂ» delusion
because she had learnt wherein lay the
truth of it. The clew was in her fin
gers. The path might be rough some
times, uphill sometimes, not all in
pleasant valleys and soft beguiling
scenes; there would be arid tracts, per
haps, and bleik uplands. Such was
the way of life: she recognized it now.
The clew was in her hand and though
she might be weary, though she might
stumble, she would not be utterly lost
or belated.
OIAPTEIl XXIX.
With Open Eyes.
Sibylla had allotted to Christine a
small sitting-room on the first floor of
the house to be her private resort dur
ing her visit; they neither of them
liked a drawing-ro-om existence all day
long. Here Christine ssai waiting John
Fanshaw's arrival St-Â« had taken much
thought wherewithal sh.e should be
clothed, but that was rather the In
stinct which asserted itself in her on
any occasionof moment than a token
of confidence in the weapon of becom
ing apparel. A fair appearance was
never- to be wholly neglected by the
wise, but she did not rely on It now.
The most that any charming could do
would be to extort a. passing admira
tion, which in its fum might secure
a transient forgiveness; but a reaction
of feeling would surely wait on it. She
did not want to be forgiven in that
way. In truth she hardly wanted for
giveness at all; at any rate she would
greatly dislike the process. She had
been put in the corner, as she said.
The position was not pleasant; but be
ing called o-ut again with the aHmoni
tlons suitable to the moment was
scarcely a more agreeable situation. By
parting her from him, first tn spirit,
then in daily life, John had hardened
her heart toward him. He had made
her dwell more and more not on her
sin, but o-n his right to inflict a pen
alty. More and more she had remem
bered what Caylesham had said, and
had asked If he who benefited by the
actâ of his own will benefited by It
had any title to despise the hand which
was guilty of it. John's distress, his
doubts, struggles and forlornness. had
pleaded against this judgment of him
while she was with him. The idea of
them had grown' faint with absence;
John had left himself tu be dealt with
by reason therT. and reason saw only
what he had done; the eye could no
longer trace the sorrow and the strug
gle which had gone with his deed.
Her mind was on Caylesham too. She
had just read a letter from Anna Sel
ford. It was full of Anna and her
frocks (Much advice was needed â when
was Mrs. Fanshaw coming back to
town?). It had a good deai to say of
Blake and his handsome presents; and
it touched on Caylesham with a rather
acrimonious rioted He had been to- see
the-m and had not made himself very
agreeable; really Anna did not see that
there was anything to criticise, nor.
above all, that Lord Cay'c-sham had
any call to sat up as a critic if there
were. Christine smiied over the pass
age, picturing so well the secret irony
and the intangible banter which Cayle
sham would mingle with his congrat
ulations and infuse into his praises.
Anna would not shrink nor retreat, but
she, would be angry and rather helpless
before the sting cf these slender darts.
Memories stamped on her very t soul
stood out in salient letters and. the face
of Caylesham seemed to bang in the
air before her eyes. To remember lov
ing is not to lover* but It may make
all other love seem a second rate thing.
She loved Caylesham no longer, but
she was without power to love any one
as she bad loved him. Others had his
vices,* others his virtues, such as they
were. The blend In him had been . for
her the thing her soul asked. Time
could not wither the remembrance, al
though it had killed the feeling itself.
Net John's displeasure was the great
est price she had paid; not John's for
giveness could undo or blot out the
past. John's friendship and comrade
ship were the best things the world had
to offer her now â and she wanted them;
but she wanted them not as the best,
but because there was nothing bet
ter. "iiBiiniipCTTrg . wbb
She had not thought of blame for
Caylesham, nor of bitterness against
him. Here her fairness of mind came
Inâ her true, judgment of herself. All
along she had known what he was and
what he gave, as well as what she was
and gave. He had given all he had
ever professed to give. (She was not
thinking of words or phrases, but of
the essence of the attachment, well
known to both.) If it had not been all
she sought, still she had accepted it
as enough â as enough to make her hap
py, enough return for all she had to
offer. She would no-t repudiate the bar
gain now. Frank had been straight
and fair with her. and she would cast
no stone at him. Only it was Just very
unlucky that matters should fall out
in the way they had. and that she

For the purpose of encouraging California and Western writers,
by offering a consideration for short stories equal to that paid by the
best magazines, and for the purpose of bringing young and unknown
writers to the front, the Sunday Call announces a weekly fiction con-
test in which a cash prize of $50 will be paid each week for the best
story submitted. There is no section of America more fertile in ma-
terial for fiction or more prolific in pens gifted to give spirit to the
material at hand than is California and the West. Therefore the Sun-
day Call offers $50 for the best story submitted each week by a West-
ern writer. Stories of Western life and Western characters will, as a
rule, be given the preference, but all strong stories, and especially
strong stories by new writers, 'will receive Â» careful consideration.
Each story will be judged strictly upon its literary merit Type-
written copy is the easiest' to read and will receive the first consider-
ation from the editor, but do not hesitate to send a story in hand-
vmting if you cannot afford to have it typewritten.
Fifty dollars in cash for a story of not less than 3500 words and
net more than 3500 words is approximately $17 per thousand words
or 1.7 cents per word. The highest price paid by the leading magazines
for the work of any but the very best writers is rarely more than
two cents a word, more often one cent and a half, and generally one
cent With the majority of magazines the writer, after his story is ac-
cepted, is compelled to wait until the 'publication of his storv before
he is paid, a period of seldom less than six months, and usually from
nine months to a year. TEe stories accepted in this contest will be
paid for .immediately upon publication, and will be published on the
first Sunday following the iudring of the' week's manuscripts.
click of five hundred horns, the
steers made a direct counter
move, sweeping, blind and Infuri- -->
ated over the bodies of their less .{-.
wide-eyed neighbors, their sharp
hoofs crunching and grinding everything
beneath into an unrecognizable mass. The
stampede was no longer a possibility; but
the boys, trained and drilled to every form
jf cattle cussedness, kept a level head and
firm foot, for the work now on.
Three 'hours of hard riding followed,
over parched arid country, honeycombed
with gopher holes and other prairie ac
complishments, before any headway was
made in circling the cattle and closing the herd down to one
immovable mass. Then came the incessant watch, riding
round and round, lest the treacherous mass break out in some
unguarded points. It was a moonless night and the icy chill
which follows the intense heat of the day fell over the wide
mesa. Shivering a little and swearing a great deal more,
the boys lit up. a good smoke being the nearest thing to sup
per in sight for a while. They were hoarse and thirsty from.>
hard riding and yelling and yet it would probably be hours be- *
fore the cattle would begin to lie down to sleep. Separating
into two relays, one half kept up the watch , while the others â¢
took a few moments' rest.
Charley Beesam, Manuo and three other boys had dis
mounted and were beginning to stretch their tired legs when
Pete sot up a loud "Wee-ya-hoop!" at the same time* point
ing to a ngure silhouetted in bold relief against the skyand^
coming on at a stiff pace.
"Likes as not that's Dave fetching some of those
hoss sandwiches," he said, turning to the group, now
intent on watching the figure.
"Wouldn't go so bad jes now if he did," so'
Flapjack- Bill (a name attained by his pa
tiality to this diet.)
The man had now tome within sight ol
all and, to Pete's j-jy aid satisfaction, it
proved to be Dave, mounted on the iden
tical mustang of a few hours be
fore, now a model of docility and
patience. He came to a sharp halt,
diggine his hoofs deep in the soft earth
and then pirouetting around on one
toe until brought to a quiet stand by-
Dave, cussing all the while as if the
whole Ten Commandments had gone
out of style.
"What's yer word, Dave?" chorused
the men before his breath had fully re
turned.
"Word?" he roared. "'Pears to me
yer red-headed missionary's been play
in' hell while you fellows was out chas
ing steers. Turnin' in, I seed the cook
and Jimmy Pikes devouring scrub rags
with their hands clinched up in th<Â»
rear and the corral of prize steers
empty as the trail of a Commanche
raid."
This startling piece of informa
tion was greeted by a dead silence,
then a general outburst of oaths
and exclamations of surprise. Pete
stood motionless and whistled â  a
long-drawn, melancholy whistle,
like an engine on down grade, even
the sandwiches and prospective
supper fading into a pale, misty
past. Benjamin William Smith
cussed the red-headed bandit, his
successors and ancestors as far'
back as Cain, and then cussed him
and them ud the line again.
"Well, 'tain't no use standing there
cusEin'," said Pete, "and that commis
sary department back where it ain't
doin' us any good; and anyways 1
banks if that red- head blows around
this camp by accident he won't need
to swipe cattle for a livin'."
"Likirs as not he'll have so much lead
in his system that Dave's pony couldn't
carry him a rabbit jump," said Char
ley Beesam, throwing a piece of sage
brush on the fire.
"I'm off to letch the chuck wagon
here to you coyotes, or I guess there
1 won't be enough of me in two
shakes to scent a rat trap." said
Dave, wheeling round and disap
pearing at a stiff gallop into the
darkness.
"Took the hint kind o' nice for
Davie, didn't he?" drawled Pete.
"Well, guess it weren't so much
charity ss his own canteen talkin*,"
said Benjamin Wflliam Smith.
The second relay of men was
stretched out around the camp
. fire tired and hungry when the
chuck wagon rumbled in Right,
and a roaring cheer went up as
the cook himself stepped out, a
glorified spirit on.'the desert, sands.
After a hearty supper the boys
turned in again on the relief
shifts and gradually the long
night of watching faded into a
pale purple dawn, emerging with â¢
a Jump from a lilac glow Into the
golden glory or tne morn, and
along with it, as if slumbering on
the sand, sprang up the fierce
heat of the alkali plains. -*; -^ h
The cattle had settled down to a
state of quiet disinterestedness, evinc
ing no memory of the night's stam
p<-de." Breakfast over, the men set to
work cutting out and branding, scruti
nizing a strange brand or staking a
maverick. The work proceeded along
without interruption until' the sun
sank down behind the broad mesas,
and another day's work was done. '
Two weeks had passed, nothing, out
of the ordinary turning up to break
the monotony of everyday grind. One
night about the beginning of the third
week the boys were seated around the
campflre swapping yarns and prairie
adventures when the subject drifted
on to, the red-headed maurauder. Nile 1
Camden, a man from Graham's ranch,
said that while driving a herd down
from Ninos to Nogales just about twi
light they came across a small bunch
of about fifty head driven 'â¢by three
strange Mexicans and a' man with
bright red hair. . .
"They didn't seem particular
anxious about beln* noticed,
kind o* keeping down . on the
canyon trail, so we con-"/.
â  eluded it would be wiser
to mind the track our noses
pinted to and move on." Notic- ,
ing the look of surprise on the
faces of the men Camden stopped
short. Pete was the first to
speak, a broad grin spreading
over his sun-browned face.
"Camden, I'll jes give ..you a piece
of advice; whenever you meets that
redhead again driving cattle or fix-

Ing a brand, you jesride w-a-y round,
unless there's six of you in the bunch'
â and if there is, fill him so full of led
that his own mother wouldn't claim
him, and peihaps you might give him
a load for Dave while you're there."
Jt was now Camden who looked .
surprised.
- "Why, when did, you buck into
the redhead when he wasn't want-
In' company?"
â  "Can't say I ever was so impolite,
but' Beein' he worked on this ranch
for, one week, got disgusted with our
grub and blew with Dave's boss
pony and three bosses, and bein*Â»
real generous , to hisself he Vcame
back and swiped 150 prize steers out
of the hoss^corral. I think #we all
owes him a grudge on that deal,
: f (Jqn't we, Dave?" . . ,/'
"Wouldn't be likely to get polite
treatment from my six-shooter, the
skunkin' horsethief," growled Dave,
the memory of the lost. cayuse rankling
in his bosom.
"Or mine either, if I seen him first,"
assented Flapjack Bill.
Pete flicked the ashes from his cigar
ette and looked him over in a half-sar
castic, 'half-amused way.
"It's about time you'd be - rollin' up
in yer blankets, Bill, and skitting off
to where there ain't no such thing as
redheads or Mexicans," he said. But -
Bill did not consider it necessary to fol
low his advice, and the topic held out
until the dying embers of the fire told
them all it was time to turn -in fo'r thu
night, and a general break-up ensued. -
Two or three months passed, and,
owing to the frequent bold raids of the
redhead, men from several outlying sta
tions had banded themselves together
for the * purpose / of putting a stop to
these depredations. It .was well known
that he was riot a man to be easily
trapped or found jiapping. "Shoot'on
Bight", were the -orders.. And lately 'he
had been pretty' successful in keeping
out tjf sight. There were a few close
calls, ~but they invariably ended In a
clever getaway, aided by the intricate
windings of ' the canyon. Pete's out
raged spirit was boiling over with in
dignation at ' these numerous failures.
Pale dawn or dusky evening found him
scouring the country on .his sure-footed
cayuse, two revolvers stuck in his belt
and his ears pricked up like a listening
coyote. Late one evening the terrified
Manuo came racing into camp on his
pony, declaring that he had been
chased for three ftiiles by this enthu
siastic head-hunter, who mistook him
for the horsethief; that â¢ he dared not
stop lest his remains be scattered o'er
the plains toifeed the hungry wolves.
Early one morning when the broad
plain was yet wrapped in a solemn
gloom of, night, four of the menâ Pete,
Dave, Manuo 'and Bill â could have been
seen driving a small bunch of cattle to
a new grazing plat which had been fer
reted out â  the day before. The boys
were particularly silent this morning,
and even the herd crept along In, the
pale starlight, a tired arid dejected
looking bnnch of steers.. Even Pete was
not as alert as usual this morning, and
small wonder he was not attracted by
a dark moving mass indistinctly out
lined against the gray-blue sky. But
for fully fifteen minutes Dave had
watched the slowly moving object, try
ing- to make out some definite shapa or
size before \he communicated the fact
to Pete. As the mass grew near it

proved fo t>e~a small" bunch ofcat
tle, approximately twenty or thirty
herd, driven by - three cowboys.
The herd, though small, appeared
to be very unruly, and the manner
in which the men tried to avoid
notice only served to arouse the
suspicions of the watchers.
A plan was quickly agreed upon
to head oft! the course of the herd,
and, if any resistance were shown
by the men, to fire oni the leader.
Acting upon the decision, Dave,
\ Pete and Bill galloped off to three
different points, forming a semi
circle directly in the path of the
herd and closing in as they ad
vanced. When the drivers had
come within a range of about
two hundred feet, Pete waa
now certain that the red
head . was leader, and
cocking his revolver he
held, it down by his
side ready for the
first move. That
v the horsethief
â¢
would not give up without a right
he was certain, but he would give him
a square deal and let the first gun
play open from the enemy.' The other
two boys had now closed In on the op
posite flank and it was evident that tha
game was near finish point. Quick as
a flash he saw the lead pony brace his
hoofs In the sand, and a bullet sang
through the air. As it whizzed by,
grazing the crown of his hat, he took
and sent the compliment homa with In
terest.
Dave and Bill now plunged headlong
Into the, sport. The cattle were rear-
Ing and bellowing; some, hit by stray
bullets and frightened by the unex
pected attack, were scattering In all
directions. ' From almost the first shot
the two Mexicans were seen making
a hasty retreat to the rear, leaving
their red-headed leader alons in the
midst of the fire.
Suddenly Pete's blood froze in his
veins, for with the wail of a woman
in agony the redhead pitched head
foremost from the saddle. Dave's stolen
bronco, freed from his burden, dashed
frantically onward, dragging the body
along over the rocky plain, the silver
studded sombrero rolling in . the dust
and with it a wig of red hair.
The fight was over. Dave, Bill'
and Pete, partially recovered, spur
red their quivering ponies to the
side of the. corpse. Lying in a lit
tle p # ool of blood, which was slowly
trickling from a wound directly
over the heart, a mass of Jet black
hair loosened from its bond and
covering her face .and shoulders
with Its heavy folds, was the poor
little redhead, horsethlef and des.
perado, who had been . hunted for
these long months, and nowâ no
redhead and no man.
Not a word was spoken. Crowd-
Ing around, the men looked silent
ly on the lifeless body before them.
At last some one said: "Well, j;il
be damned!" This nevertheless
seemed to break the spell. Drop
ping to his knees, Pete tor* the
rough flannel shirt from the bosom
to see If the action of the heart had
entirely ceased. A cold chill was
creeping over the body, and he
knew that 'life was extinct.. As hi
â¢was about to withdraw the glint of
something metallic arrested his at
tention, and, following Dave's' sug
gestion, he draw out from an in
side pocket a Email leather case the
size of an ordinary envelope, cap
ped with silver.
For a few seconds he stood, turn
ing it over in hia hands. "Perhaps
these is her identification papers,
likes as not." he said, handing it
jover to Dave. Kind o' look
through, and maybe it says where
she is from and where she wants
to go.^' ,
Dav<* took the envelope, and after
carefully scrutinizing the contents
found nothing he considered of im
, portance but a small slip of note
paper, yellow and soiled from much
reading. This, he read aloud, the
boys crowding around to find some
clew to the life of the dead bandit.
It ran as follows:
- "Jlrs. G, S. Stiilwell â Dear Marlen :
At first you will be hurt and grieved
when you read this â  letter, f ijut After
due consideration I know that your
broad mind will see the wisdom of my
act We are absolutely unsuited for
one another, so different in our hopes
and aspirations that further tove
would be an Impossibility. Here in
York I feel that I may live again
and wake out of its lethargy my fac
ulties and powers of mind. If you
pursue the same course and learn to
forget your ardent love for me, my
dear little girl, you will find In it all
the happiness you could desire. Tours
sincerely, .V^
i "GEORGE S. STILLWELL."
â¢ A low murmur of scorn and & few
round oaths came from the boys as
the letter ended. A livid hue had
spread over Pete's weather-beaten face
as Dave handed the parcel back, and
even when the boys lifted, the body on
a pony to carry it to its resting place
he did not move. Long he remained
standing, his hands on his hips, his
face set in a stern hard frown, look
ing down on the ground, v ;> ;
How long he did not know, but n*
was brought out of his lethargy by -a,
light tap on his shoulder, and- looking
up he saw Manuo holding his pony.
"Senor, come down to camp?"
He said yes, and Peter, without an
swering, jumped his pony and foN
lowed.
A decided flatness of tone seemed' to
hang around the caxnpflre that night,
havering over the tiny flame as it
flicked up and was lost In the ashes.
In straight vernacular the boys were
"stumped."
"There isn't anything to say worth
saying but cuss words." drawled Dave.
"And the boys have split them all' up
the back trying to rip them off at
once." The cow-puncher blood was up,
they had branded the wrong steer and
the "running irons" burned In their
hands.
But on no pair of shoulders did the
ignominy of the deed seem to fall so
heavily as on Pete's. Â»'>â¢->

000. Here is material for a historical
"work. worth;- on account of its signif
'icance to take rank with the annals
of nations. This opportunity has been
embraced by Miss Ida M. Tarbell.
whose work. "The History of the
Standard Oil Comnany." will, I be
â¢ lSeve. rank as ore of the most com
plete and authoritative contributions
t*i economic histoiy written in the last
â¢ quart- r century.
When Miss Tarbel! commenced the
ferial :>ublicatif:j of her storr of
. OH ir. ilcClure's Magazine
â¢ two years ago she inaugurated the
new regime of what has been termed
â¢"national journalism." Her searching
analysis of one j>hase of present day
questions, pursu* Â«] without fear or fav
or to a complete conc-Jurion, inspired
â¢ Firr.ilar efforts or*, the part nf other
writers, more* or less qualified to speak
â¢ "authoritatively, and the Ieadir.gr majra
' zincs havt- for a v?ar nast been mak
ir: : fratvrre o* rs-ork â¬tH after the
. lines adopted by &I!sr Tarbell. This
" has trar.spirtd. r.ct without some es
eence of charlatanry and "wildcat"
journalistic endeavor intruding itself.
Storms of protest, of crimir-Etion and
recrimination have attended the course
of the new national journalism; one
of the magazines that have been fos
tering this line of policy has launched
. boomerangs of frenzied articles, which
are now making the swift circuit back
.to the propelling hand. The "History
. *>f the Standard Oil Company" is not
of these specious penny shockers,
hurled forth at white heat and sud
denly cooling before facts. After the
work had concluded its serial publi
cation the author took opportunity to
â weigh every protest, investigate each
suggestion proffered by readers, friend
ly or unfriendly, and after Incorporat
ing this new material and revlsirig the
old she has allowed her book to stand
â¢ in permanent covers as an unimpas
eioned review of the growth and opera
tion of the first of the trusts.
" -Miss Tarbell has gone straight to
original sources for her material. Ac-
Curacy, In so far as accuracy may ac
'J Â«rue from the great mass of document
ary evidence and the testimony of in
dividuals bearing upon the subject,
â¢ marks her every statement. From the
"books of private firms, from the find
ings of investigating tribunals, both
State and national, from the minutes
cf corporations and associations, the
statistics of trade, the reports of com
mercial bodies, the contracts of rail
roads, even from the sworn statements
.$>f Standard Oil officials themselves, the
author has taken her facts. The bulk
j .-of her sources of authority is enormous.
â¢ The chance for the admission of erro
' neous and unjust deductions is great.
The major part of the . material â¢ has
' never been turned over, and conse
.quently pioneer work In the choosing
. find rejecting of evidence has had to be
.Miss Tarbell's own. With all this
weight of difficulties militating against
&* clear and unprejudiced statement of
facts, this woman who has set herself
to the task of giving the story of thirty
years* war in oil brings to the reader
convincing evidences of the conserva
"tism and unquestionable authority of
her word.
Besides this chief characteristic of
the vrork there is another which makes
for the inspfrtting vigor of the narra
tive. The writer has the power to focus
the whole broad field of her investfga
â¢ tion into a compass such as to make
vivid and pulsing before the reader's
eyes the drama of human endeavor
'â which epells its purpose in the three
letters O-I-L. The history of oil in these
thirty years past has been the record
of war â war no less costly in super
human endeavor and in treasure than
the strife at arms. Play and counter-,
play, campaign and counter-campafgn,
all of the arts of craft and ingenuity
have been invoked in the tremendous
struggle for supremacy on the* one
hand and existence on the other which
has been waging between Rockefeller's
â¢ trust and the Independents. This Miss
Tarbell has caught with a quick recog
nition of the dramatic. Though figures,
tables and statistics make the ground
work of her book. "The History of the
Standard Oil Company" is an absorb
ing record of human activityâ a book
â uhlch holds one with its portrayal of
titanic struggle. Like Green's "History
*of the English People," this work is a '
human document as well as a
ry.
The story of Standard Oil is the story
of man's work, that man John D.
Ruckefilkr. For his perseverance,, his
tiieJtss energy, his phenomenal skill
as a tactician in finance and his in
domitable purpose, which knows no. let
or hindrance from moral x>r ethical con
siderations. Miss Tarbell finds no more
perfect a counterpart in the world's
history than Napoleon 1: the efficacy of
the el^boratf machinery of hiv oil trust
she believes best comparable to the or
ganization of the Roman Catholic
church, liere is the writer's antithetic
chaÂ»-acterizaticn of the most wealthy
man in America:
"Mr. Rockefeller was 'good.' There
was no more faithful Baptist in Cleve
land than he. Every enterprise of that
church he had supported liberally from
Ms youth. He gave to its poor. He
visited its sick- He wept with its suf
fering. Moreover, he pave unostenta
tiously to many outside charities of
whose worthiness he was satisfied. He
was simple and frugal in his habits.
He never went to the theater, never
drank wine. He gave much t'me to
the training of his children, seeking to
clt-velop in them his own habits of
economy and of charity. Yet he was
willing to strain every nerve to ob
tain for himself special and unjust
privileges from the railroads which
were bound to ruin every man in the
cH business not sharing them with him-
He was willing to array himself
acainst the combined batter sentiment
of a whole industry, to oppose a popu
lar movement aimed at righting an in
justice so revolting to one's sense of
fair play as that of railroad discrimi
nations. Religious emotion and senti
ments of charity, propriety and seif
denial seem to have taken the place in
him of notions of Justice and regard for
the rights of others."
This was the president of the. Stand
ard Oil Company, who, in 1872, having
absorbed all of the important rival re
fining establishments in Cleveland, be
came a party to and afterward lead-
Ing spirit in the South Improvement
Company, the parent of the Standard
Oil Trust and the initial effort at com
bination to the restraint of trade in
cur Industrial history. Miss Tarbell's
analysis of the organization and aims
of this pooling of railroad and oil-re
fining interests and the ultimate effects
of its secret operation gives an ade
quate idea of the trust idea In Its very
inception.' With the Erie, the Lake
Shore and New York Central and the
Pennsylvania railroads secret compact
was made, by virtue of which the
South Improvement Company, as al
leged representative of the majority
of the country's refining interests, was
to receive discrimination In freight
rates over all independent refineries.
Not only were the Improvement com
pany's constituent manufacturers to
receive secret rebate on shipments ac
cording to the railroad's freight sched
ule, but for every barrel of oil carried
for outside refiners a drawback equal
to the rebate was to be paid into the
hands of the South Improvement Com
pany. The railroads further pledged
themselves to keep the party of the
first part well informed as to the ship
pings made by independents by ' pro
viding daily full way-bills of petroleum
skipped over their roads. Thus the
South Improvement Company not only
was permitted to ship at less cost than
its rivals, but to ' follow closely Just
what business these rivals carried.
Followed the oil war of 1872, which pre
sented the solid front of the producers
everywhere opposed to the machina
tions of this combination. The produ
cer?, through threatened boycotting of.
the railroads, caused these corporations
to break their contracts with the im-
provement company, and the first mo
nopolistic propaganda was defeated.
But, as the author shows, the spirit of
the combination rose phenix-iike from
the ruins and became the foster parent
of the trust to be. 'Mff-'
The author's narrative continues to
detail how, with his secret-combina
tion ruined, Rockefeller boldly ad
vanced an open alliance of refinersâ
the "Pittsburg plan" â based, as was its
progenitor, upon railroad" discrimina
tion. Then followed the abortive at
tempts of the oil men to make effec
tive a Producers' Union by limiting the
output. Pipe lines, laid to combat the
railroads, next became a factor: a sea
board pipe line has a brief fight
against the Standard and then be

Miss Tarbell's narrative until they
carry down to developments of recent
years, the apparent dissolution of the
trust by order of the Ohio court in
U88. its subsequent life under a^ dif
ferent formula, the reorganization of
independent producers and their
grouping under the Pure Oil Company,
and finally Standard Oil's fight^for the
world market to-day. . â¢ .
In her concluding chapters upon the
legitimate greatness of the Standard
Oil Company and its present-day econ
omic aspects the author treats of the
c&tholie interests which have come to
belong to the trust through the great
movements of its wealth and of the
marvelous perfection of its complex
machinery of administration â the de
sign of John D. Rockefeller. Concen
tration of authority into the hands of
men of phenomenal executive ability,
infinite economy of time, of material
and of money, the wisdom exerted in
placing plants at strategic points in
reference to transportation, daring in
attempting new measures commensur
able with the quickness in discovering
opportunities â these are some of
Standard Oil's business characteristics
which Ida Tarbell can commend. But
she believes that the ethical effect of
business such as that which has made
Mr. Rockefeller a multi-millionaire is
deplorable. She says:
"Very often people who admit the
facts, who are willing to see that Mr.
Rockefeller has employed force and
fraud to secure his en'ds, justify him
by declaring 'it's businenwr* That is,
'it's business* has to come to be a
legitimate excuse for hard dealing, sly
tricks, special privileges. It is a com
mon enough thing to hear men argu
ing that the ordinary laws of morality
do not apply in business. Now, if the
Standard Oil Company were the only
cencern in the country guilty of the
practices which have given it monopo
listic power, this story never would
have been written. Were > it alone in
these methods, public scorn would
long ago have made short work of the
Standard Oil Company. But it is sim
ply the most conspicuous type what
can be done by these practices."
And very pertinently she adds this
note of warning "Canonize 'business
success,' and men who make a success
like that of the Standard Oil trust be
come national heroes!"

THE WAR
in the Far East
** MONG the very first books to be
fj written about the war in the Far
jji East Is "From Toklo Through
* ' , Manchuria With the Japanese."
by Major Louis Livingston Seaman, U.
S. A. This officer/ who is a surgeon in
our army and whose work with the
medical ' corps both In Cuba and the
Philippines gave him distinction in
that branch of the service, -Went to
Japan last June primarily to make a
study of the manner in which the Jap
anese conserve their army from that
malign destructive force more to be
dreaded than bullets, disease, and to
gain an Insight into the hospital and
Red Cross services as they are operat
ed in the Mikado's land. Being a good
observer and being likewise well for
tified with ; good credentials," Major
Seaman eaw a great deal that was not
germane to the interests of his- pro
fession but thar contained Interest â¢ for
the whole reading world. These â¢ two
fold observations he has put â¢ into ; his
THE SAN /FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
book, clearly, succinctly, making it one
of the' most interesting publications of
the season.
Major Seaman is the first otfseryer to
convey to the outside world -anv com
plete idea of the marvelous state of
preparedness to which Japan had.
schooled herself in anticipation of the
struggle which Is now waging. Tac
ticians ar.d war correspondents have
sent back reports of the reserve force
in ships, rnen and arsenal supplies
which the island empire has estab
lished as her second line of defense,
but it remained with the author of this
book to reveal the almost incredible
painstaking whioh has marked Japan's
effort to perfect herself for the con
flict which has been looming on the
horizon of her national affairs since
the, last gun in the Chinese war was
fired. Japan is the first country, ac
cording to the writer's conception, tc
make any adequate and thoroughly
conscientious attempt to combat dis
ease all along the line from 1 the gar
rison to the field and back to the hos
pital.. As a result of the remarkable
preparatory work which has been done
"by the medical department of the Mi
kado's military the care of sick ana
wounded consumes but little time, for
r.i .thoroughly has preventable disease
b<=.cri guarded against that the per
centage of sfck has been cut down
almost to zero and all soldiers are in
-such perfect phrsical condition that
wounJs, even the most . grave, yield
readily to treatment.
In the field, as in' the barracks at
home, the medical , officer makes his
power one of the potent factors of the
army's existence. The regimen of diet
prescribed admits only of that quality
of food which is palatable, easily digest
ed and readily converted into sinews of
energy. Medical officers precede the ad
vancing army to test wells as to the
potability of their waters, to post warn
ing notices in infected districts, to make
analysis of all food stuffs foraged from
the surrounding country. As a result
of this vigilance, which reaches to the
most Infinitesimal detail, the loss to
Japan's fighting men from preventable
disease was but a fraction of one per
cent in the first six months of the
struggle with Russia. A silent com
meatary this upon the record of our
armies in the Spanish war, where in a
campaign of six weeks the relation of
mortality from disease to' death by bul
lets was as 14 to 1. The. writer quotes
a Japanese officer as saying that Japan
withher 500,000 fighters is more than a
match for Russia with her 2,000,000, for
disease will carry off four Russians to
every one. slain by a. bullet.
Aside from the many other features
of . the Japanese medical and commis
sary service, which win unqualified
commendation from Major Seaman, he
has spepial word of praise for the treat
ment accorded Russian prisoners. While
at- Matsuyama, the Improvised military
prison, the writer was struck with' the
courtesy and excellent attention ' ac r
corded the captured soldiers of the Czar
there. "Many of the prisoners declared
frankly that they had never fared bet
ter in their lives," saya Major Seaman.
Npt all matters of medical detail are
the contents of this book. As "said be
fore, Major Seaman was a good ob
server and one curious to get' as near
as possible to the scenes of activity on
the fighting lines. After leaving Japan,
therefore,^. He made his way, to Chefu,
thence to .* Newchwang, and af ter v the
evacuation ' of that place . by .the Rus
sians he made â  four â¢; ineffectual but
thrilling attempts to get -into Port Ar
thur. : It "was while going by 'sea from
Chefu to Newchwang that the author
had opportunity to corroborate the
news reports concerning, the indiscrim
inate sowing of the open seas with mines
by the , Russians. Besides seeing sev
eral boats come Into Chefu with'float
ing, mines on board which had been
picked up at sea, the subject of these
experiences, had v the â¢ opportunity of
rowing. within fifteen feet'of : a Russian
contact mine which had been anchored
directly In the path of vesesls sailing
neutral waters. He took a ; photograph
of the devHish engine of destruction,
whfch is reproduced in this book, and
he also took down its exact position on
the chart â evidence for possible conten
tions in The Hague tribunal.
So full of interest is Major Seaman's
narrative that.it is difficult to limit
comment and excerpt to the exigencies
of space. He tells how he spent several
days as the guest of Chung Tzor Lin,
once a "chief p'f the Hung-hutzes (Chun
Chuses), or robber bands of Manchuria,
but now a general in the Chinese army.
He gives some vivid pictures of , the
scenes attending the Russian evacua
tion of Newchwang and the subsequent
Japanese occupation. His version of
â  â  Â»
the "Heshitelney affair," as the cut
ting-out of the Russian torpedo-b^at at
Chefu- has -come to be called in the
language, of diplomacy, is as clear In
the main as . any that have come
through the medium of the press; he
believes that the presence in that neu
tral. port^cf a Russian wireless telegra
phy fctatic-n justified the Japanese In
the belief:that China could not enforce
neutrality and palliated in a measure
their breach of international courtesy.
Though Major Seaman is strongly
pru-Japanese in his sympathies he has
not let his prejudices color the narra
tion of facts. His feeling for Japan, as
he is free to confess," was inspired by
the intense devotion of the people to
their ruler and his cause in this war.
Thus was the sentiment of Nippon's
warriors put by a young officer who
was taking leave of the author prior to
embarkation on the transport:
i "You people of the West love your
God. You fight for your God and you
die for him. Our people love theirEm
peror, their Mikaclo. They fight fur
him. they die for him. I go to die for
my Emperor. Like the rest of my fel
low officers, I too have put on the white
kimona."

MYSTERY
of the Deepest Dye
FTER having endeavored to clear
/J~ his shelf of a large portion of the
fl holiday books last Sunday the
writer of these columns had
made solemn covenant with himself
that this week's book page should be
devoted to the solid books of the sea
son exclusively. A certain novel,
picket* up at random to relieve the
tension of two volumes of close read
ing, assaulted this resolution success
fully and immediately. . This novel was
Burton E. Stevenson's "The Marathon
Mystery." To let another week pass
without recommending this tale un
qualifiedly to the readers of these
columns would weigh upon the mind
of the reviewer as a distinct evidence
of his incompetency.
Here is a story of mystery so mathe
matically arranged in its various con
volutions of Plot and reaching the de
nouement A by a deductive scheme so
perfectly correct that no component
part of the stt/ry, not half of a chapter,
could be lopped off- and leave the chain
of narrative unbroken. This perfec
tion of construction is so artfully done
that not until the last page Is turned
does the reader begin to realize how
noiselessly and harmoniously the ma
chinery Tof-; Incident has moved. 'Abso
lutely In, the : dark as ;U> the problem's
solution < until the last chapter is
reached," with interest and speculative
attention kept at the qul vive through
out"'the~whole, one cannot but make
favorable-'; comparison between Mr.
Stevenson's boqfc and those tales of
Edgar Allan Poe which find more or
less of a lingering echo In 'the stories
of a recently, knighted and always pop
ular English author.
A young New York society woman
of delicate sensibilities and faultless
character, is "found alone by the side
of a murdered sailor, in suite. fourteen
of the i Marathon flats at night. She
refuses '. to " explain the cause of her
presence there and declares that the
' murdered^ man was ; a" total < stranger â  to
her. No clew to any other possible as
sailant of the dead man can be found.
How Is she cleared from all sus
picion and the guilty one run to earth?
Here is a riddle which could not even
be "ridiculously simple, my dear Wat
son," to Sherlock Holmes himself.
In following the path of a New York
police reporter to the hidden source of
the mrstery the author has filled the
hook check full with sudden surprises
and nerve straining suspense. False
suppositions, seeming at first plausible
to the acme of simplicity, are followed
until they fade into absurdity. Ac
tions and attitudes on the parts of the
principals remain Incomprehensible un-
til the final solution clears all. A sec
ond sudden murder and jewel robbery
seem to condenjn a spotless young man
to the electric chair; hi3 sweetheart
even believes him guilty; then sudden
ly the subtle fin.cer of deduction points
conclusively and condemninglr to one
who would be the last to invite sus
picion. In just one point is the au
thor's skill a trifle wavering. When he
introduces a deadly serpent into the
story during Its early chapters, seem
ingly ir.Â«i-nificant though the thing
may be in its guise of a household pet,
the reader is prepared to anticipate
without any intuitive guidance the
griEij' climax of the last chapter.

JOTTINGS
On Book and Writer
Apropos of Mrs. Gilbert's recent
death, in her eighty-fourth year, it is
interesting to reproduce Mrs. Clay's
reminiscence of her, told in "A Belle of
the Fifties," published by Doubleday.
Page & Co. Mrs. Clay says: "A
most amusing metrical ' farceâ'Poca
hontas'âwas acted during the winter
of '57 and '58, which set all Washington
to laughing. In the cast was Mrs. Gil
bert. Two of the ridiculous couplets
come back to me as if they were yes
terday,, reviving the amusing scenes in
which they were spoken. Mrs\ Gilbert's
role was that of a Yankee achoolmarm
whose continual effort it was to make
her naughty^ young ; charges behave
themselves. ''Young ; ladies,' , the cue
with that inimitable austerity behind
which one always feels the actress' con
sciousness of 'the fun of the thing'
which she is dissembling; 'Young
ladies, stand with your feet square;
Miss Pocahontas, just look at your
hair.' And as she wandered off, a top
knot of feathers waving over her head,
her wand with ' which she had been
drilling her dusky maidens hel^ firmly
in her hand, she cut a -pigeon wing
which brought forth a perfect storm of
applause."
The recent death of General Lew-
Wallace, author pf "Ben Hur," brings
freshly to mind the extraordinary
of this novel. Published by
the Harpers on November 12, 1880,
the book for the first year of its ex
istence showed no signs of popularity,
nor did its sale improve much In the
second year. Then it began to grow,
and has grown steadily, until now,
twenty-four years after its first ap
pearance, the sale is greater than it
has ever been. The book succeeded
on its own merits, and made its way
not only with the American public,
but , with the people of many other
countries in which foreign transla
tions have been printed. Furthermore,
and what Is very remarkable in the
history of this novel, it has never
been issued' in a cheap edition. Four
teen luxurious editions of the ,book
have been published from time to
time by the . Harpers, but never a^
cheap' one, as in the case of "Uncle
Tom's Cabin." the sale oC.whlch was.
of course, greatly expanded by the
circumstances under which it was
published, many thousand copies hav
ing been issued in paper as a tract-
No edition of "Ben Hur" cheaper
than the' regular- $1 50* form - In
whfch it was first published has ever
been madel It is estimated that the
book has now sold well on to a mil
lion copies; and the royalties from it
and from the play founded upon it
made General ' Wallace a rich
man. And e%*ery. indication points ttv^
ita continued popularity for years to
come. It is interesting to note that
the other novels published â .. contem
poraneously , with "Ben. Hur," those
that have kept alive until nowâ with
the exception of the works of Mark
Twain and W. D. Howellsâ could be
counted 'on the fingers of one hand.
"Ben Hur" has survived by reason of
its own intrinsic charm as a story, and
the remarkable fineness of its,work
manship, UDon which the author ex
pended patient and loving care. It
Is .probably the .most widely read
novel of modern days, and it has been
said that -not to have read it argues
oneself ill-read.
"Ivan the Terrible," bv K. Walis
zewski, whose able work in iho b!*>
graphical" and critical â¢ field has made
his name well known to hundreds of
readers through translations, has just
been published by J. B. LJppiricott
Company in a large octavo volume of
over 400 page*, with index. The trans
lator in this case ia Lady Mary Loyd.
and the book is furnished with a por
trait of Ivan the Terrible. Mr. Walis
zewski devotes himself to Russia in
the sixteenth century, to the country,
people, political, social and intellec
tual life and to habits and customs.
He addresses himself directly to the
youth of Ivan, touching' upon him as
the first Russian Czar, and following
him through the early reforms, the
taking of Kazan, the conquest of Li
vonia, the struggle for the empire of
the Baltic, concluding with a consid
eration of the political and intellec
tual evolution, the Anglomania of
Ivan the Terrible, the Polish invasion
and the conquest of Siberia. There
are two chapters on the court of Ivan
the Terrible, on his private life and
on the, man and his work. The book
is furnished with a bibliography and
constitutes one of the most Important
as well as one of the most entertain
ing contributions to the field of bioar
raphy.

the reward. At least that scheme was

One bleary afternoon in March I

Gulf. It was my first experience in the

had fared pretty well. The steamer
picked me up, a footsore and hungry
tramp, at a jay seaport in Louisiana
for the round voyage to Vera Cruz. By
the time we reached Galveston, home
ward bound, I was fed and rested and
chesty. The negro steward who tutored
me in food passing as an art wanted
me to linger and be of use to him, but
I spurned the proposition, demanded
my pay and went ashore. He had a lot
to pay about ungrateful white bums.
While I didn't look much like a

ON AND OFF THE BREAD WAGON
BEING HARD LUCK TALES AND DOINGS OF AN AMATEUR HOBO
sailor, I felt and acted the part. The
odor of dishwater and prunes,. instead
of tar, pervaded my youthful being, yet
I walked with a nautical roll, ever and
anon giving my greasy trousers a hitch
and squinting up at the sky. For an
hour or two I loafed about the wharves
talking of my travels with oyster
openers, crab fishers and unemployed
crap shooters, who are to be found in
large herds at Southern seaports. That
evening 1 dined on raw oysters at an
open-faced cafe built against a wharf
shsd, and told the proprietor many in
teresting things about Vera Cruz. My
ship anchored three miles from shore
during our stay at the Mexican port. I
remained on board the entire time, and
a dense fog prevailed night and day.
Still, as the restaurant man had never
been to Vera Cruz, I was able to tell
him all he wanted to know about the
place.
Being a thorough sea-going person,
as I thought, the only place for me was
on the water front, bo I hove to for the
night at the Mariners' Retreat. This
snug haven for sea rovers was a'one
story shack squeezed in between a
green hide store and a saloon that had
a heavy list to starboard. Even on the
outside the building wore an air of
happy, careless intoxication. My new
friend, the oyster man. steered me to
the Mariners' Retreat, which displayed
a signboard executed in oil by a barn
painter, who had, the true conception
of Bailors. The one he depicted wore
wide, flat trousers, a flat hat, with rib
bons dangling from the brim, and his
shirt was open almost to the waist line.
This decollete effect was necessary to
display the topmasts of a ship supposed
to bo tattooed on tae bosom of the
mariner. In feature the man on the
signboard resembled Tom Sharkey, only
his expression was more spirited and
lifelike than Tom's.
The Interior arrangement of the re
treat comprised four rooms; two on
either side of a hall, with kitchen and
dining-room at the back. Each room
contained two double beds. The front
door opened on the street, and just in
side the portal sat a withered little old
man with the lower part of his body
embalmc-d In a horse olanket. On his
head he wore a seaman's wool cap, and
under his chin a narrow frings of pale
sandy whiskers of the kind known as
Scotch shrubbery.
"Did you want to say good-night to
Grandpa?" he squeaked in a rat-like
voice. â
"Who is grandpa?" I asked, wonder
ing if he -were a mislaid relative of
mine.
"Me," said the little old man. "Guests
must say good night to Grandpa before
turning in- It's a rule of the house.
Twenty-five cents. Have yo-u got the
money?"
into the stupor.
The girl was beside him with a swift
movement, the basket thrust Into the
car, her hands placed firmly upon his
shoulders, her eyes close and gazing
straight into his, lovingly, compell
ingly.
"Ben," the voice forcing itself into
clearness and steadiness, "look at me

Having thus opened the feast of rea
eon and flow of soul with the custom
ary toast to the ladies, we shall pro
ceed at once, if not before, Jo the gen
eral Intellectual menu. One of the men
with whom we are concerned came
from somewhere out in the woods, no
matter where. The important thing
about him was that he was possessed
of a hand-made Intellect with a Boston
finish connecting directly with a rotary
vocal apparatus. When his brain was
running at high speed ; he would ac
quire a momentum that would carry his
voice on for some time after his mind
had stopped. The beauty of that kind
of an equipment is that it gives the
mind an opportunity to rest now and
then without checking the flow of
words. This is a' highly desirable con
dition for those who regard conversa
tion as merely an exercise of the voice.
We would give this Individual with
the epllt-secona intellect a name If we
could think of one that would suit him,
but names are troublesome things. If
some one else came along who was
marked with the same label there
might be all kinds of a fuss, especially
if we should happen to say something
that might appear uncomplimentary- to
the ' gentleman with the Boston
thought- works. For i that reason we
"Oh!" I said, " 'good night' means to
pay in advance. Sure. I've got the
price."
He looked at me sideways while I
exhumed a loose quarter from my rai
ment and placed it on the table. Kick
ing his thin legs out of the horse blan
ket Grandpa picked up the coin and the
lamp and started, to lead me along the
hail, when he paused as if held up by
a sudden thought.
"Have you any- change?" Grandpa
asked courteously. "So many guests
spring large bills on me and I cannot
go out for change."
I told him I had $6 in silverâ my pay
day on the steamer.
"How fortunate," chuckled the old
gentleman. "You can break this $5,
if you'll be so kind." ' >
Five of my silver dollars were ex
changed for the bill, and Grandpa
showed me to "my cozy apartment . in
one of the rear rooms. There was just
space between the beds for a fellow to
stand and peel. Chairs w^re deemed a
needless luxury In the Retreat.
"Now, sonny." said Grandpa, holding
the light in the doorway while I dis
robed, "you can sleep on the front side
of this b*d. Like as not there'll be no
more guests. And for 25 cents you may
have a nice breakfast in the morning.*"
With that the kind old man backed
away and once more settled down in
his horse blanket at the front door.
By the light of a hall lamp thrown over
tho low partition I crawled into >bed.
first placing my purse In my vest and
hiding it beneath the sheet under my
shoulders. It was daylight when % I
awoke, fee'ing much refreshed. .Â« The
other bed was empty, but showed
symptoms of having been occupied.
Hearing a noise at my back, I turned
over and found a dark-browed, stocky
man, fully dressed even to his shoes,
lying on the bed between me and the
wall. On seeing me awake the stranger
bade me a cheerful good morning,
crawled out and sat on the side of the
bed. â 'â¢;â¢; 'â¢;â 
"Will you be so good, young fellow,
as to lace and tie my shoe?" he added.
"I've got a lame hip on one side and
can't bend low enough."
"Certainly, sir," I replied, willing to
oblige the afflicted. "It's a terrible
thing to be lame, sir."
Hopping out I knelt down to lace the
shoe. While at work on that labor of
love I was pained and shocked to de
tect my faithful vest lying on the floor
under the bed. With a horrible fear
at my heart I hauled out the vest' and
found the purse, .empty and turned In
bide out, stuffed back into the pocket
in which I had left it.
"Look at that!" I p-asped. "I've been
robbed in the night.!"
"Well, I declare, if that isn't so!" ex
claimed my bed partner, equally aston
ished. "This is a wicked town and no
mistake. Must have been the fellows
in the other bed. They went out early.
I'm glad you don't suspect me."
Thanking me for my kindness the
alleged lame man limped out of the
room, leaving me to wrestle with some
afterthoughts. What puzzled me was
how the vest got from under my body
and took a header to the floor without
disturbing my repose. That I had been
touched was plenty plain and clear, but
when and by whom was the mystery.
My pillow was in place, but the lower
â¢she<rf was gone from my side of the bed
and lay in a sort of window down the
center of the couch. That explained

no one was in sight. The fruit train
on Track 6 was Just leaving the wharf
and 6 was sounding its. last warning
call. Half carrying and half leading
him, she hurried Messenger 10 to the
nearest entrance, only a few yards
away. Several drays were standing
about waiting for a job. She mo
tioned imperiously on the owner of
the nearest.
"Listen, Ben," she said slowly, put
ting her lips close to tho ears of the
now almost insensible man in an ef
fort to make him hear and compre
hend; "I am going to send you home.
You mustn't worry a bit I will fit it

them gently from his fingers. Then,

shall refer to him simply as the brainy
man. There is another man, but his
appearance will be postponed, until
later. The brainy individual's long suit
with the ladles was playing up the in
tellectual life. He had nothing but
contempt for those muscular, and
thoughtless members of his sex who de
voted their spare time to whacking an
inoffensive golf ball around a four-mile
course in the fewest possible number of
cuss words or tempting fate and the
speed law with a French-made vehicle
for the promotion of homicide- and
equine, nervous prostration. The
thoughtful man was all for the quiet
life; and he didn't tare who knew It.
There Is no particular harm in any
kind of a man picking out any kind
of a life that appeals to him, provided
he can pay for It. The beautiful thing
about a free country is that a man can
think anything that he wants to, If ho
doesn't tell any one else about it. The
trouble comes when a 'man- takes the
covers off his theories and exposes
them to the gaze of a mercenary
world. The particular idea of the in
tellectual man which led to his down
fall was, of course, concerned with
woman, lovely woman. Most downfalls
do have something A do with women,*
somehow or somewhere. If a man
doesn't make a fool of himself because
some daughter of .Eve tempted "him,
he does it because she didn't. In eith
er case jthe woman is to blame.

had rolled me for my roll. By pulling
the sheet away inch by inch he caused
me to turn the other way in my Inno
cent slumber until the treasure vest
â was within his covetous graspr I
awoke before he could get away with
the swag and the shoe game was but a
cunning subterfuge. He wanted me to
discover the looted vest under the bed
before he departed and thus divert sus
picion from himself. Neat work.
My wardrobe was intact. for the rea
son it was not worth stealing, and I
had no baggage. After dressing I went
into the hall to confide in Grandpa, but
he was off watch. In the kitchen I
found a good-looking but dissipated
young man making things, the odor of
which were maddening to a hungry and
bankrupt bby. .
"Who runs this outfit?" I demanded.
"What has that to do with you?" re
torted the chef.
"Lots," I gaid. "They robbed me in

and pushed, the bottom of the purse
up into the place where the money used
to be. There it is. Look at it."
"Well, I'm sorry for your- tough
luck," said the cook in a soft and, it
seemed, complacent voice. "I own this
place, but sleep elsewhere. The old man
you saw last night is the watchman.
Did. you request him to put your valu
ables in the safe?','
"No, sir; I didn't know you had a
safe."
"Then I'm afraid we cannot help you
any," he replied somewhat sadly and
ignoring the safe query. "You were
very careless, but you needn't pay for
your lodging." ' *â¢< 't\
"To-night?" I asked, eagerly.
"No, last night." ::,;
"Why, IS paid for that in advance
said good night to Grandpa," I added,
with a ghastly attempt at humor.
The cook laughed, turned his fat
back on me and prodded the good
things on the. stove. He was guying
me and, rather than stand for that sort
of thing I went out and walked around
the block. In one respect I was a full
fledged mariner. The sharks cleaned
me out the first night ashore, and once
more I was up against the starvation
gag. Gradually the system by which I
was touched unfolded itself. Nothing
could have been easier or neater than
the syndicate hotel skin game worked
in the Mariners' Retreat.

was the outside man. He did the steer-"

Dear old Grandpa, with his cheerful
little good-night joke, was a sort of
investigating committee. His business
was to probe the financial standing of
a. mariner. Changing the $5 bill was
but a subtle stratagem to get at the
size of my pile. And the quick-witted
gentleman with the lame hip was the
night operator â the â"an with the gen

Inside, she again glanced sharply
around. A man was running in her
direction, heading toward the rear of
the train. She recognized him as a
friend of Ben's.
"Hello, Miss Delia!" he called;
"come to see%Ben off again, have
you?. He's a lucky dog. But you must
excuse my hurry. This train pulls out
in three minutes and I must reach my
section."
Delia could hear her heart thump

"Your section is the rear, I sup

carelessness.
"Yes," over his shoulder, "the eight
een rear cars. I'm messenger 28. Ben
has the forward twenty cars. I switch
off at Memphis for Jefferson City and

As he hurried away Delia's face

the workings of his cerebellum- on ev

had fairly established himself In the
most comfortable chair on the summer

of. the weather for the next twenty
four hours, he would ' launch a few
choice extracts from the latest collec
tion of predigested thought that he had
been absorbing. It didn't make any
difference what it was; all was fish
that came to his Intellectual net.

the legitimate hotel ~25 makes a fee
ble bluff at giving his victims some

piracy.
About the middle of the forenoon,
tired, disheartened and hungry, I
sneaked past the Retreat. My late bed
fellow, now half drunk, stood in a cocky
attitude in front of the place. One hand
rested on an awning post and the other
on his lame hip. A row of brown ci
gars protruded from his vest pocket,
and his hat was canted over one eye.
"Hello/ bub!" the Boss Dipper said in
a disgustingly familiar way. "How
much did you lose last night?" just as
if he didn't know.
"It was my all,, sirâ all I had In the
worldâ six dollars."
"Don't let that worry you," he said
in fatherly accents. "All you can buy
with money is whisky and tobacco, and
such things won't do you any good.
Cheer Up."
And thus I left him in the enjoyment
of his ill-gotten wealth. -;: .
On first leaving home I was desirous
of procuring employment, so my letter
of Introduction stated. Now I wanted
a job. A" swift canvass of the town dis

then the car began to move forward.
She had never been on a train tje

but her father had been a messenger,
and Ben had many times told her the
details of his trip. She must manipu

.It was w hard trip, for the outside
thermometer rose from 31 degrees to
70 degrees in six hours, and the next
morning was back again to 31 de

shifting of the ventilators, with an im
possibility of keeping the car ther

Zero rather would have been infinitely
preferable, for . then the ventilators
could have remained closed and the
fruit would generate enough heat of

ThV man with the cerebellum had
come to. the conclusion that this par

about the right size and general qual

"Is the foreman about?" I inquired
of the Blighted Being.
"I'm him," he replied, actually blush-
Ing. "What can I do for you?" :.;:*-
My needs were soon explained. I
told him my hard luck story from top
to bottom: Howvmy watch and trunk
were in hock In New prleans; my
tramp to the Gulf; the sea voyage, and
the lifting of my $6 in that pirate's
nest â the Mariners' Retreat. Also I
mentioned Mudvllle. 111., and the names
of the men I had worked with there.
He knew one of them, and his heart
warmed to me. The sad foreman bus
tled about, fed me from his dinner pail
and talked a blue streak. To one of my
youth and inexperience he could un
bosom himself and escape ridicule.
"While I'm foreman here," he con
fessed, with another blush, "they won't
allow me to hire any one. I do all the
work myself." â¢ â¢
"And bosa yourself, too?" I inquired
in a burst of astonishment.
"In a manner of speaking, I have my
own way pretty much," he confided. "I
do all the work, load the melting fur
nace, melt the iron and on casting days
the owner hire3 a couple of niggers to
help me with the ladles. For years I
wanted to be a foreman, and this Is
it," he * half sobbed, "making these
bloody grate bars. Enough to drive a
good nian daffy. But, say, I can get
you a Job on the outside if you'll take
U." -\^ VL:
Of course I would. In a minute, so the
unhappy boss.' of himself wrote me a
note to the superintendent of the street
car system.
"That man Walsh Is a friend of mine.
I once saved his life and he'll do any
thing for me." .-'V' i -{â¢ ,;-.
Mr.- Walsh read the note and with
bad grace. I thought, sat me at work
"DETECTING TRAIN ROBBERS AND COLL ECTINQ THE REWARD."
She was careful' to keep herself out
of sight, and this she was able to do
the more readily on account of the
fruit train making few stops. At Mem
phis the rear section was switched off
to connect with a train west, and her
own was attached to a train which
had just pulled in from Galveston, the
engine returning to New Orleans with
a lot of empty cars.
A few hours later, at a â watering
stop, the new conductor caught sight
of her as he was hurrying along the
train. She was Just sliding the door,
but too late.
"Hello," he cried, pausing, "a wo
manâtramp!"
Delia slid back the door.
"No, sir," she answered quietly,
holding up the papers she had taken
from Ben; "I am in charge of this
section. -â¢ I haven't had a chance to see
you before."
The conductor gave a long whistle
which ended In an apologetic cough.
But his face lengthened visibly.
"What's the company thinking of?"
he ejaculated hotly. "Next we know
girls will be put in as conductors and
brakemen and engineers." .And he
hurried away, still choking resentfully.
Seven days later Delia entered the
company's Office at New Orleans. The
manager himself happened to be in and
he seemed to recognize her by the pa
pers she carried in her hand. He came
forward quickly. But at that moment
a figure wbich/had been lounging about
the street doorâ a white, anxious-faced
man, who had been peering into the
his own. It the afternoon he took
her walking and bombarded her with
extracts from books on Nature, with
a capital N. In the evening they
foregathered in the front parlor with
Emerson and Ruskin and other, au
thors whom everybody talks about
and nobody reads. The fact that the
young lady usually went to sleep
about the second round of the ves
per service would have hurt the man's
feelings if he had ever noticed it,
but a man who is so lost to a sense of
decency as to read Ruskin to any
woman under forty-five is not likely
to be very observant of his surround
ings when he has once gone into his
trance.
The campaign appeared to be pro
gressing favorably and the brainy guy
was Just on the point of suggesting to
the young lady that, they make an
arrangement to continue their. Intel
lectual seances adown the stream of
life together when she announced her

study of the sporting page and a
steady and intense mental application
to the menu cards of various swagger
restaurants. But he could turn out
airy persiflage till the cows came
home and he was not likely to im
press any woman with a sense of his
mental superiority.

I straightened up and rested my hands
on my hips, My spine, too, -needed a
change of scent>. That move was th*
cue for Mr. Walsh, who popped out
from somewhere.
"Say. young fellow," ho growled, "wa

you busy. Gome to the office and get
your pay."
I protested I was only waltlng.for th<->

I could get my hands under and help
raise it. but the highly indignant Mr.
Walsh fired me just the same. He couUl
not well ignore the request from th-^
man who saved his life, but there was
nothing in the bond to prevent Mr.
Walsh giving me the grand boiyice on
short notice, and I got it. Ho paid mo
off with thirty cents' worth of street
car ticketsâ two hours' work at th<>
rate of fifteen cents per. That helped
some, as there was no "Seeing Galves
ton" car in those days, and I couldn't
squander my salary touring the city.
Had the peculiar significance of thirty
cents been established at that time I
would, perhaps, have told Mr. Walsh
his life was worth just what It cost him
to discharge the obligation he owed the
foundry foreman. But. alas! I was shy
on repartee, the same as other neces
saries of life, so I hit the trucks of a
passenger train to Houston.

with them, when he admired herâ yes,
when he treated her as something pre
cious, clever and brilliant. Then she
had rejoiced in his pride In her and
friven of the best she had to preserve
and strengthen It- Now, In resent
ment against John she sought to*deny
this., But in what mood would John
come? The maintenance of her denial
depended largely that.
Suddenly she heard the sound of
wheels stopping before the gate of the
house. She eat erect and listened. The
hall door opened. She waited till she
heard it close again, then sprang up,
cast a glance at a looking glass over
the mantelpiece, then turned and faced
the door. Her lips were a little parted;
the stood very still. Expectation min
jrted with defiance In her bearing. A
few minutes passed before there was a
knock at the door. She cleared her
throat to cry:
"Come in!"
John entered and closed the door
carefully behind him: but he did not
advance toward her at once. He stood
where he was, with a curious depreca
tory Emile on his face. She thought he
looked rather old and worn, and he was
shabbily dressed, as his habit was
when he had to look after his own
wardrobe without advice and criticism.
He carried the sense of forlornness, as
he had when he sat with Caylesham'a
chr-ck before him. and the air of being
ashamed, too. But his manner gave
now no hint of anger. Christine's heart
went out to him in a quick impulse of
pyxnpathy; but she crushed the feel-
Ing down, and would give no outward
sign of it. She waited in stillness and
ellence. It was for him to speak, for

him to set the note of their interview,
and of more than their Interview â of
their future life, and of how they were
to be to one another henceforward.
"Here I am. Christine. Mrs. Grant
ley told me I should find you in this
room; and here Lam."
She nodded her head coolly* but
gave him no other welcome. He came
two or three steps toward her. holding
out his hands in front of him in an
awkward way, and with that ashamed
pleading smile still on his lips.
"I can't get on without my old girl,"
he said. \ j
In a flash of her quick hi tuition she
knew his mind. The one sentence re
vealed anything which his manner had
left doubtful, He was doing what he
thought wrong, and doing it because he
could not he!p it. He was abandoning
a great and jU3t grievance, and there
by seemed to be sacrificing the claims
of morality, condoning what deserved
no forgiveness, impairing his own self
respect. His position, with all its ob
vious weakness, had not become un
tenable in theory, and his reason, hard
bound In preconceptions, was not con
vinced. He came under the stress of
feeling, because his life had become in
tolerable, because, as he said In one
of his phrases of rough affection, he
could not get on without his old girL
The need he had of her conquered the
grievance that he had against her, and
brought him back to her. He came
with no reproaches, no parade of for
giveness, with neither references to the
past nor terms for the' future.
It was a triumph for Christine, and
of the kind she prized and understood
bestâ a woman's triumph. It had not
been expected; It was none too well de
served. A color came on her cheeks,
and she breathed rather quickly as she
realized the completeness of it. For a
moment she was minded to use it to
the full, and, since she was no longer
the criminal, to play the tyrant in her
turn. But the very perfection of the
victory forbade. It inspired in her a
feeling which reproaches would have
been powerless to raiseâ a great pity
for him, a new and more genuine con
demnation of herself. Had she been
bo much as that to him, and yet had
used him so ill? â
"I've been lonely, too, John," she
said. "Come and kiss me. my dear."
He came to her diffidently, and hard
ly touched her cheek when he kissed
her.
"That doesn't feel a bit like you,
John," she said with a nervous laugh,
as she made him sit by her on the
sofa. "Now tell me air about every
thing! I know that's what you want
to do.". '

herâ to have her again to share his
Interests and to be a partner in his
fortunes. Yet for the moment he could
not do as she bade him. He was much
moved, and was very unready at ex
pressing emotion. He sat in silence,
â¢gently caressing her hand. It was she
who spoke.
"Of course there's a lot to say; but
don't let's say It, John. You'll know
I'm feellns it. and I shall know that
about you, too. But don't let's say
it." She broke into a smile again. "I
should argue, you knowâ I always ar
gue! And then- â But if we say
nothing about it, perhaps we â well,
perhaps we can nearly forget it, and
take up the old life where we broke
it off. And it wasn't a bad old life,
after all, was it, in spite of the way wo
both grumbled?" , : '<VÂ£
"My dear old girl!" he murmured.
"I suppose you must be as vulgar as
you like to-day!"^ said Christine, with
a dainty life of her brow and an af
fected resignation. Then suddenly she
turned and kissed him, saying gravely:
"I'm grateful, John* and don't â don't
think there's anything wrong in being
generous."
"I only know I've got to have you
back with me," he said. "That's all I
know about it anyhow."
"I think it's enough, then," she whis
pered softly.
Presently the gates of John's mouth
were loosed, and he began tell all
his news. It was mainly about his
businessâ how. it had flourished, how
he had built up his credit again, of
the successes he had won; that as soon
as he had paid off his debtsâ a mo
ment of embarrassment befell him here
âthey would be as well off as ever
they had been; horses could be bought
again, the diamonds could reappear,
there would be no need to stint Chris
tine of any of the things that she
loved. All that he had longed for sym
pathetic-ears to hear in the last
months came bubbling: out now. < And
Christine was ready to listen. As he
talked and' she heard, the old llfo
seemed to revive, the old interests of
every day come back, exercised anew
their uniting power, and brought with
them ; the old friendship and comrade
ship. Christine had said that they
could "nearly forget." The words had
her courage in them; they had her
caution, too. To forget what had come
upon them and between them was im
possibleâIn Christine's obstinate heart
even at this . moment hardly desired;
but It was possible nearly to forgetâ
at most times so nearly to forget. as to
relegate the thing to some distant
chamber of the heart and - not -let it
count In the commerce and communion
of the life which they had - lived to
gether . and which bound them to one
another with all Its ties. That was the

best thing which could be looked to be
forgotten in thought. They were pick
ing up and piecing together the frag
ments. The ruin here had not been as
utter as it had at poor Tom Court
land's where the same process was
being undertaken; but there had been
a crash, and, though the pieces, might
be joined, there would be marks to
show the fracture. Yet even the mem
ory that refused to die brought its
good with it.' After the ruin came the
love which had in the. end sought res
toration: If. the one could not be for
gotten, the other would always claim
an accompanying remembrance. From
this remembrance there â¢ might well
emerge the worries and the friction of
common life which in the old days had
so often disturbed their peace and in
terrupted their, friendship.
Before dinner Christine found an op
portunity to visit Sybilla. in her
room.. Her own brief excitement
and agitation had passed off; Si
bylla seemed -the /more eager of the
two about the event of the day. Chris
tine related it. Her comments on it and
on what it meant ran * ery much in
the foregoing vein, but were mollified
by her uÂ«ual veneer of Irony, for which
her. friend made easy allowance. Si
bylla had been prepared for an ecstasy
of sympathetic congratulation; but it
was evident that, though congratula
tion might be welcomed, ecstasy would
be out of place. Neither Christine's
conclusions from the past nor her an
ticipations of the future invited it.
"How reasonable you are, Christine!"
sighed Sibylla. "And how immoral!"
she added : with a smile. "You're not
really very sorry about -it all. you
know. You're just very glad the trou
ble is over. And you don't expect a bit
more than It's quite likely you'll get!
Do you know, you're very UBeful to
me?"
"My reasonableness or my immorali
ty?" | . i .
"One's an example and the other's
a warning." laughed Sibylla.
"I don't think I'm Immoral. I've had
an awful lesson and I intend to profit
by. It. There'll be nothing more of that
sort, you know."
;-"Why not?" Sibylla asked, curious
tolprobe her friend's mind. ;

better than I've been thinking lately."
'â  "I ' must * get â  more like ' youâ not quite
like i you, .but more like you.; I mustâ

"I should think It had a good deal to
do with it," admitted Christine dispas
sionately. "Oh, well, I needn't â run
rays If down too much. Really John
has a good deal to say to It."
"I've Frank, too."
"Yes, you have; and you're in love

"That doesn't always make it easier."
"At any rate â¢ it keeps up one'&* in

"I don't, know that I car* so much

thirty-five!" v
The Idea of years making any differ
ence, to her moods or her needs seemed
rather a new one to Sibylla. Evidently
she was holding it In her mind and
turning. It over In her thoughts.
The idea was with her still as she
sat rather silent at the dinner table
that evening. They had a little party,
for all the Raymores joined them, and
young* Mallam was there also, their
guest for the night. Christine was very
g-y and satirical. John watched her
with ready admiration, but less ready
understanding. The young men were
rather noisy, toastlng-to-morrow*s wed
ding to the confusion of the bridegroom
and the equal confusion of Eva Ray
more, to "whose not distant destiny
both Jeremy's words and Jeremy's eyes
made reference by no means covert.
Kate Raymore and her husband looked
on with the subdued and tempered
happiness which was the outcome . of
their great sorrow, their triumph
over it, and the impending depart
ure of their son, to complete the
working out of his atonement. They
talked of the Selfords with some irony,
of poor Harriet Courtland. of Tom
and his children with a sympathetic
.hopefulness and a touch '. of- amuse
ment at the importance their dear old
Suzette . Bllgh was assuming and was,
it seemed, to assume in the household.
Sibylla's own thoughts widened the
survey, embracing in . it the couple
down at Old Mill Houseâ the faithful
patient woman: whose love made even
the . ridiculous touching â the broken
old man ': who had given the â¢ best of
his life in expiation for. a brief mad
ness, and now crept; home to end his
days, asking nothing, but peace, hop

shunned. - Above in . his cot lay her

ciously himself In order to the search
and discovery of something more true
and precious still. The Idea of the
ever passing years and of feelings and
fortunes appropriate to each stage of
life helped her, but was not enough.
There were differences of minds, too,
of tempers and of views; and every
one of them implied a fitting in, per
haps a paring away here or an addi
tion thereâ a harmonizing; these
things must be if the system was to
work. Reluctantly and gradually her
ardent mind, by nature ever either
buoyant In the heaven of assured
hope or cast down to the depths of
despair, bowed to the middle conclu
sion and consented to look through
the eyes of wisdom and experience.
Happy he who can so look, and yet
look without bitterness, who* can sea
calamity without despair, and accept
partial success without peevishness.
There were the hopeless cases. These
must be explained of left unexplained,
by what creed or philosophy you
chose to hold. There were â surely
there were! â the few perfect ones,
where there was not even danger, nor
the need, for effort or for; guard. Of
such she had deemed hers one. It
had needed much to open her eyes â
much sorrow and wrong In her own
life â much sorrow, wrong and calam^,
ity In the lives which passed within
her view. But her eyes were open
now. Yet she took courage â she took
courage from Grantley, whose crest
was not lowered, though his heart was
changed.
, So spoke reason, and to It Sibylla
bowed. The array of cases, the mar
shaling of Instances, all that the peo
ple and the lives about her had rep
resented and typified â their moral
was not to be denied. But reason is
not the sole governor, nor even the
only teacher. It might open her eyes;
It might even moderate the arrogance
of her demands; it could not change
the temper of her heart. She was
not even chilled, far less embittered.
She went forth -to meet life and lovo
as ardently as ever. The change was
that she knew more what these thing3
were which she started forth to wel
come and perceived better to what she
must attune herself. She would hope
and enjoy still. But she asked no
more a privilege over her fellows. She
could hope as a- mortal without im
munity from evil and enjoy as one to
whom there Is allotted a portion, of
sorrowâ and not of her own only, nor
perhaps of her : making, nor of her
fault, since her own act and by na
ture's will her being was bound up
with the being of others, and her
happiness or misery, success, or fail
ure, lay in the . common fortune and

all for which any approach to It was

The battle was won. As John Fan
shaw sacrificed his great grievance,
so she hers. As old Mumpla had
expiated his fault and paid tha
price, so she hers. As Grant
ley schooled his heart, so she hers.
She walked with him that night in tha
garden while the rest made merry "with
games and songs and Jokes within,
their gay laughter echoing down to tha
old house where tha long-parted hus
band and wife sat at last hand In hand.
She bowed her head, and put her hands
in Grantley* s, saying:
"At the first sign from you It was
easy to forgive. Hot could I not for
give you? But it's hard to ask to bo
forgiven, Grantley."
"It was necessary that these things
should come," he answered gravely.
"They have come and gone. What are

stood opposite him with dancing eyes.
"You're alwavs thorough. I was

THE END,THE RAGING
OF THE SEA
(Copyright, UÂ«f-i, by JJcfiure. Phillips & Co.)
IT may hs that in her under parts â
in some twist of Leel or bottom â
Job Luffs i>unt was most won
drousJy constructed; to the casual
eye. which was Invariably contemptu
ous, she was stubby and stupidly squat.
"With all her heaviness of outlineâ her
Juggy. sullen guise at anchorâ she had
an evil refutation for nerves, the bad
n&jiie of a slender rake of a craft, and
t-he was damned as a. reprobate crank
in three harbors for the lives that had
been lost from her. The gossip of the
Cuke and the stage, had she but under
stood, would have touched her true old
htart to the quick. When they rallied
Job Luff on her way; he made vague
allusion to a salmon's belly; so it may
be that her perversity proceeded from
a crank in her keel or bottom, for Job
had fashioned both in secret. She was
a well-intentioned punt; all she de
manded was a modicum of faith and' a
sympathetic hand on sheet and steering
oar, which is to say that she craved to
be understood. She nosed her way
through high seas with gusto. In the
eight of Job Luff her only fault was
that she was a laggard in a light wind,
and he freely forgave her that.
It was in Ihe image of this Job Luff
that she was made; a tawny lout,
frowsy, greasy, shiftless, with a queer
twin to him â a glint in his eye, a
fleck cf red in his shifty glance.
In the days before the tide lured
little Skipper Jo and Ezekiel Sevior
into the maw of the sea (when all
the mysteries of sea and sky and wil
derness were revealed in a flash)
never a great wind cam/ but they
sjed to Lookout Head to see Job Luff
â¢beat in.
In the hot days between the times of
oaplin and herring, when there is no
bait and the fish are jigjred from the
shallows. Job Luff followed the sign to
Windy Cove, with Billy Luff, his boy.
at the- bow oars, to keep the head of
thÂ« punt up, if luck should be with
them; and there he found the cod. nin
fathoms deep, dawdling in the shadow
of the rock*. The rish had eluded tha
fleet for thr*Â»e days and now that ths
fleet wap stupidly hanging ofT shore in
the Eun-soaked breeze, tossing in the
lop. and flocked like aimless ehe*'p.
Billy kept thv boat out of thi break
ers' grasp while Job jerked up the fish
on the prongs of his Jigger.
. Never the fi~sh of a scale got to the
tpying eyes <.i the fleet, for Job Luuâ
the tawny old reprobateâ worked thÂ»*
jigging line with one h^nd and held his
pipe in the other, meantime giving
great and delusive clouds to the b.-eoz.':
and he slipped the catch ov*r the gdn
wale under cover of the great body;
and. with a sinful chuckle, added it
to the rising heap ur.dÂ°r the tarpiulin
The fleet lookouts kept keen watch on

gleam of a fish; and th^-y wElspjreJ to

"Do they be cotchin' anything off
shoare. b'y?" Job asked.
"Xar a belly do I see, zur." said B:i!y
Luff-
. The fish were thick. Job's arm was
wearing out. He hauled in a great cod
caught by the tail, and slid it under
cover.
"Eleazar Manuel do have his eye on
we, zur," said Billy.
"Dunderhead!" chuckled Job. "W T here
be they now, b'y?"
S"They be tag-gin' Jacob Sevior toâ"
"Do he be comin' this way, b'y?"
Job asked in alarm.
"Sure. noa. zur; he do be gonin*
wing an" wing for the rrfounds off th?
Mull. zur. They be handy to his
etarn."
At the last it was a gunwale load.
The catch overflowed the holds, fore
and aftâ lay glistening everywhere; the
punt was sunk low with its weight.
Lord, how goodly a catch it was! What
a triumph in the sight of men! Here
v.as a fat fellow, almost as big as Billy
himself. It was the promise of a Jew's
harp and a bullseye and a picture of
the Queen. The sea had been plunder
ed of six of that weight â six fat. sleepy
fellows. Thore they lay. Happing
their shiny tails! When the trader
should bring his treasureship into the
harbor they would be turned into
raisins and a red handkerchief. Job
vowed it then and there- The silver
bellies in the afterhold rippled with
smiles.
They dazzled the eyes of Job Luff.
Here was a length of calico for the lit
tle maid. Here were molasses and tea
for more winter evenings than one.
Gleam chased gleam over the scales in
the ffcrehold. The catch shot silvery
flashes back at the sun. This was a
plug of tobacco; that one would go
â with the broose for breakfast; this
â¢would put a pane in the loft window
when the enow flew; that would give
the gcotl wife a new spade. There was
a cong in heart of the man. It was the
eong of the victor. Such a catch it was.
He -would work no more for three days.
He would lie in the Â£un of the hillside.
He would climb the cliff and watch the
gulls circle over the sea. It was a gun
wale load! The sea had been plun
dered while she sl<-pt.
"The fleet do be runnin' hoame, zur,"
said Billy Luff. "They be scodtin* for
the caster tickle."
It was not yet night. "Hoame, b'y!"
exclaimed Job.
"Iss, zur. Eleazar Manuel do be in
the lead. He've a reef to his mains'I.
They be goain' fast, zur. Jacob Sevior
do be reefln* his sail now."
The sea. as visible from the cove, was
placid; the sky was an unruffled blue.
"They must be wind t'other side o* the
Head," said Job. "Pull out, b'y."
Billy Luff pulled out, with his heart
in a flutter of fear.
It was the gale from the northeast â
the rasing of the sea; it had burst from
those moody distances' which are be
yond the kÂ«n cf the coast; wherein, in.
the experience of the men of the place,
peril lurks always. It had corne like
a force bent on ravag/. There had
been no premonition In sea or sky;
it had caught the little fleet of Ragged
Harbor napping off Mad MulL The
zenith was overcast with thin clouds,
which the wind had torn to shreds.
They spread themselves quickly over
the blue in the west: they raced trÂ»
obscure the sun. Heavy clouds, with
waving tatters, rose solemnly from the
horizon, which was black.
"We be eotched, zur," said Billy Luff.
Windy Cove is narrow and precipi
tous. Above and below the cliffs rise
sheer. There is surf In every part. The
water is spread with foam. The place
is noisy with the crash of wave against
rpek. There is no harbor there. It is
s trap for punts in ; a pale from the
nor'east. The trap shuts when â¢ the
wind strikes with full force.
"We be eotched, zur!"
It was a Question. of abandoning tlw
punt and catch.
"You goa ashoarc\ b'y," said Job
sharply. "The punt do be too heavy
a'ready." He pushed .the boy. eft; "By
Gawd, I'll taks un in safe!" Hi
snatched up th* uars. "They Ije no
wind that blows the punt Can't ridj
out." The ilara that proclaimed thi
twist in the man was now in his eyes.
"Get t' h'oame by the goat path, man
o'-war way, b'yÂ»\'
"Sure, I \sz 'feared t' leap, zur."
"Hut!" -:';-
Job backed the punt toward a break
in the rock. Billy made ready to leap
for the foothold it offered. Job let the
punt sweep in with a breaker, stern
on. His oars were poised â alert.
"Jump, b"y!"
Th<? water sank. The boat went down
with it as though to its wreck. A l>!ack
abyss opened btfore the boy. He hesi
tated. Job pulled the punt out of dan
ger before the breaker had fastened
its grip upon it. He said nothing.
"Hark f the gale, b'y!"
The sky was black overhead. A
strange dus=k was filling Windy Cove.
The gale was so near that they cjuld
hrar the sÂ«=-a hiss.
"Iss. zur."
"You be a true man, b'y!" Job .ex
claimed.
Billy crouched to raring. Job let the
pu'it dritt in, ready, as befor?, to pull
out before the time of grace was past.
It went swiftly to the verge of the
abyss. Â»
"Now!"
Billy leaned. He landed sure and
clung to the rock like a mussel. Job
was breathless when he had wrested
the punt from -he breakers" churn.
"Oh, fawther!" Billy cried. He was
looking dawn from the solid ground
above He was overcome by that ter
ror which an advancing storm inspires.
Job had pulled through half the dis
tance to i?ea room when the gali struck
the cove. The sea water seethed about
the punt. The spume covered" the man.
Noise confused him â noise compounded
and r*Â»-echolng, as in a cavern*. It was
as though the wind tried to push him
into the depths of the cove, where the
breakers could grasp him to' his . un-,
doing. The wind swept from a wide
place into a harrow. It was like
water rushing through a straightened
channel. In confusion he could not
prevail against that force. He drifted
back. The distance between the punt
and the breakers diminished by inches.
The space lessened visibly. The punt
had no part in this fight. She was the
prize.
It was the wind pitted against the
man's spirit and the sheer strength of
his arms and. back. The wind veered
of a sudden. It caught the punt on the
port bow and struggled to turn it
broadside. This was the crisis. Had
the risht arm of the man weakened
the wind would have won mortal ad
vantage in the increased surface /ex
posed to its force. Job perceived the
imminence of disaster. He concen
trated his strength in his right arm and
forced the bow back Into the wind's
eye. His muscles were sore of the
strain put upon them; and he was now
bleeding at the nose. But the momen
tary gain steadied him. He exerted his
strength intelligently.' " He pulled with
craft, taking advantage of every lull to
creep up. Thus he drew away from the
.breakers. .
"Now for it^ lass!" Job cried. Thus
the first stirrings of the Joy of conflict
expressed themselves.
The escape wa3 Into new peril. The
gale had trailed wet dusk over the har
bor and the sea between. The tickle.
through which the fleet had now fled, to'
the sanctuary of the harbor basin, was
marked by its breakers. It was but a
splash of white in vague distance. The
sea was a gray, tossing waste, with
shadowy limits. The surges in the
northeast communicated their restless
ness to its depths. The shallow surface
waves took contrary direction with the
madcap windâ excited themselves to be
wilderment, to irrational force and vcl
ume. Thus the attack was delivered
upon flank and front simultaneously.
Ihe punt was laden with the catch.
I>id she complain of the load? She call
ed it ballast. There's a brave heart
for you! She rammed the b\ack, spume-,
crested waves each in its turn, as they
rose to strike. They cams in, infinite
nuiobers, rank upon tHe heels of rank,
the plumes of the pressing host stretch
ing far into the immeasurably expanse.
Let the creaking of her eld timbers be
likened to ea^er whines! In that spirit
she attacked. Interminably the waters
rose to engulf her. Sha sprang . at
th^m, faltering only to gather fores:
she struck them fair; she shattered
them into spray; she shook herself free
of the clogging fragments and plunged
on with such grit and strength as
swells the heart to see. "â¢
The folk of Ragged Harborâ the two
hundred soulsâ were gathered on Look
out Head to watch Job Luff beat in, as
they had gathered many times before.
They were standing full, in the wind
on a slope of rock high above the sea.
Job's wife was there, with her brood
hanging to her fluttering^ skirts! The
rain had ceased. The alrAvas washed
clean. The sea was suffused with gray
light. The punt was clear.to the patch
on her sail.
"Why doan't he heave his catch
over?" cried Jim Rideout.' . '
"She'll ' swamp when hs. fetches
about," said Eleazar Manuel.
"I mind me he've weathered warse
gales, Eleazar Manuel," said Job Luff's
"She'll swamp like a flash, woman "
Job stood off to the south. The new
tack was cleverly taken. The punt was
now almost broadside to the rock.
"What's he to?"
"Runnin' for Boot Cove, b'y."
"He've lost hisself. The lop do be too
heavy t* land."
"Do he be heavin', his fish over, Elea
zar?" This was Sammy Arnold, who
was near blind of old age. Â«
. "He be's comin'; about." V "
" 'Tis a clever hand with a . punt "

"Do he be heavin' his flsh over, b'y?"

"Noa, b'y. : Not ; Job . Luff I"', ',.
The punt came, tearing in, through a
head, sea, reeling.1 plunging.' Job held
! her up to it with that rag of a sail.
"Do he be 'shlppin'" water," Eleazar?"

Again Sammy. Arnold. V !
"He do be bailln' now." â¢â *â¢. v -
"Have he his sheet fast, b'y? â¢ I do
be blind this day.
"Iks, sure; 'tis tied to his foot."
Job managed the sheet with his foot.
He worked the steering oar with his
right hand and bailed- with the other.
" 'Tis a stiff punt," said Sammy Ar
,nold.
" 'Tis that."
The punt was coming to her i own.
Ragged Harbor watched her keenly as
she reeled through that head sea. In
all. the years of her unhonored life not
so much had been said before.. > i
. " 'Tis a gran' punt," said Eleazar

"'Tis the best punt f Ragged Har

There was no one to' gainsay it. /In

Job was under the Head. The tickle
stretched from before him to the calm
: of .the . harbor basin. ; /The punt's flgh t
was .won. It Was for the man to sweep
through 'to placid water; but net
through placid waterâ through nÂ«ise
and tumultuous waves, a narrow place
where the breakers - reach from the
rocks on either side like claws. * It was

the middle. : Job ran his eye over the
catch. Then, madly exultant, he look
ed up to the people on the rock. He had
won!. It waa a triumph for courage and
the punt. But in that vaunting glance
he betrayed the punt. Â»A puff of wind
caught the- rag 'of a sail; elsewhere, a
breath to be disregarded; here and now,
with an l/nwatchf ul hand on the sheet.
a transcendent peril. Job's eyes were
on the people. Every faculty was sub
merged in. his exultation.
| Two. things followed; for. one, the
hand on the oar Mfaa lax; moreover,- his
perception of the situation .of the punt
â the. immediat? . formation of the
waves, and the sphere of the breakers
.â Ti-as, for the . instant, suspended.
Hence, when the wind caught the sail,
its influence was not instantaneously
counteracted. The moments of grace
flashed past while the man rallied his
faculties to meet the danger; . while,
too, he possessed \himself anew of, his
immediate surroundings. His. impres
sion of the waves and breakers had to
be destroyed and reconstructed. Those
waves which had been photographed on
his brain- when he looked up at the
people had now subsided; new onfes had
replaced themâ waves of different form
and place. Those breakers. which had
been* gathering force to dash against
the rocks had delivered th sir attack,
had broken. and fallen, . and were now
gathering for a ne\y rush. The face of
the tickle " was a new face. He was
dazed.. Time was consumed," also, in
determining upon a, course of action. It
took time to transmit'directions to the
hand on the oar, time for the hand to
'â  comprehend, '.to; summon its strength
and to exert it.
! -v These â ' were supremely momentous
periods. " Job had â¢ betrayed ' the " punt.
The puff of wind had swerved her from
her course. A long, lean breaker, reach
ing far out from Black Rock, had laid
hold of her and fixed its clutch. She
was swept In. Her motion was like that
of a failing stone â imperceptible at
first, gathering speed, accelerating to
a rush. The man felt the new Influence
in the beginning. -Then he. perceived
that all his strength â which he now
furiously exerted â could not take her to
the placid i water of the harbor, a few
fathoms beyond. She had been carried
out of her course. She was caught. She
was doomed. Hence he diverted his
strength to swerving her bow on to
the rock, that -he might save himself.
The possibility of his escape was con
.tained in seven seconds of time. He
dropped .the oar and lsaped forward;
then crouched in the bow for a spring.
His eyes swept the . face : of the rock
for a foothold while the punt ad
.vanced. There was but a flash of time
for discovery 'and decision. The glance
was swift, sure, eager. It fixed itself
at the .last on a narrow ledge. The
sum of all those things which are im
portant to a man hung upon the pos-
STbility of reaching that ledge.
Job made "the leap when the* punt
overhung the abyss, but from sinking
ground; for the wave," as though of
craft, pulled the boat "from his feet
as he. sprang. .. > ...
V It must be said that Black Rock is
at. that point near sheer.--. The. cliff 'is
weather-broken and rotten; .frost and
wind have fretted narrow ledges there
in and left a crumbling surface,- which
latter, scales off, in most 1 paits,. under"
a violence no greater than thfe;bent of
a child's strength. - Now, ' the : sudden
descent of the punt" had 'disturbed the
man'sieap. For tnat reason he missed
his hold with one foot. The toe of
his right boot struck the rock below
the .ledge. That foot found no place.
Hence he tottered. His full weight waa
upon the other foot, which was firm
fixed from toe to instep. Supreme re
sponsibility centered, momentarily, in
the muscles of that leg. But he was
toppling backward; he would fall to
the wave which was then crunching
the punt and he would be cast up with
splinters. He clawed the rock for a
handhold. His right hand caught a
projection; this crumbled in his grasp.
Even so he had brought himself
back to within a hair's weight of a
balance; but the weight of the hair
was against him. If the left hand
should fail in its search, that differ
ence would surely prevail. The third
finger found a crack with a frayed
edge; the nail caught a scale'of rock â
a loose scale, which trembled under
the strain. Upon that scale â upon its
tender, slender connection with the
great body of rock â the issue now de
pended. Here all the struggle cul
minated â the mighty exertion of thÂ«
cove, the skill and courage of the at
tack upon the waves, the little punt's
stanch repulse of high seas, all ended
in the strain the finger nail put upon
the scale of rock, and that strain was
not. greater than a thread might sus
tain^nor longer than a breath.
The scale held. The finger nail did
not break. The man drew his body
forward. The wavÂ» rose to his boot
tops and washed with expiring
strength about his feet. It left him
below PUnt WaS a splintered wreck

rocks took on their sunset garb of
struck the bellies of the catch and
â were radiantly reflected. The fishes
of the gunwale load gleamed for a
space, where they floated with the
splinters of the punt that had gone
to wreck in all honor. They shone
like burnished silver while they sank,
fluttering into the black, hidden depths
of the tickle. Night advanced with
swift feet. Heavy clouds covered the
sun as it sank. Dusk enshrouded the
Pillar and the Staff. The wind sighed
and died. Silence descended. From
ther. summit of Black Rock Job Luff
looked out oyerx the sea to the edg>*
of the world. There a streak of lurid
red separated the sea from the sky.
ItjWas'a tragedy of. that coast!â¢
FROM the old lop meeting-house arose a
& chant, sweet echo of a determined
past, the music-history of Anglo-Saxon
fortitude- The preacher had not yet ar
rived and beneath the trees sat the wise
men of the community, and when Old Lim Juck
im got out of his wagon, conducting his wife to the
-iÂ«.Mjr, a youns fellow well trained in manners arose
to give the chicken fighting oracle a peat. He sat
down with his back against a tree, put his hat on
ih<> ground beside him, uttered the necessary com
mon j laces Incident upon meeting his friends, saw a
needed rain coming within two days, and then aftei
tt short silence remarked: "I eee that a Jedge over at
Raleigh in grantin' a divorce says there don't appear
to be any doubt of the fact that marriage Is a failure.
From time to time within the past few years I have
l'-earn aomethin' about this here failure on the part of
marriage, but never put my mind down on it till one of
<n:r own Jedges rendered his d&cleion in the matter." )
And then 'Squire Brizlntlne spoke up. "And does it
Heeiu to you, Lemuel, that he has got anywhere close
down to the truth?"
Out of his hat the old man took his red bandana
handkerchief, wiped hla brow and, spreading the
handkerchief across his knees, replied that it was a
Matter that needed some little investigation. "Take the

Don't appear to have been a failure in his case."
The boys laughed and Squire Brizintine blew hla
nope with a loud snore, for it was known.that r.ot
Jons after the death of -his wife he had paid court
to ihe widow. "It Is a question," old Lim con-
I'.n-jod. 'that is a aggitatin' of society, and has
been I reckon since the Lord first flung open the
front door of time. And it is a subject that so â¢
many folks are related to one way or another
that it sorter makes a feller feel sad to think
about the opinion of the Jedge over at Raleigh.
But the only way to find out whether or not the
thing is true is to start an nggitation and keep it
a goin'. There are thousands of men that stand
ready to come forward, and swear that human
life Itself is a failure and has been, ever since old
Noah drank too much of his own wine. There
is= away to look at everything and make it a
failure. The gospel itself is only a success in
spots. And I reckon it's putty, much that Way
with marriage. If the right spots ain't found it
ain't the fault of the institution of marriage, but
is error in the Jedgment of man."
"But how about the jedgmertt of woman?"
Ffjuire Brizintine put in, and the .boys smiled, for,
in the neighborhood it was well known that the
squire and his wife had with their dissensions
awakened the echoes of many a dark night.
Old Lim sat smoothing his handkerchief
across his knees. "Well," said he. "with

One close day late In February
came the crisis of that awful summer
"ot a leaf stirred. The air at each
inhalation burnt the lungs, and the
limit of human endurance seemed to
have been reached. Yet It was this
afternoon of all others that Hill or
dered Paton and Malcolm to fill the
big iron tank.
They worked hard for an hour, Mal
cclm filling the buckets and handing
them up to Paton. who poured the
contents Into a tank. When their

"We've filled the five-hundred gal-

where Bill half reclined in a steamer
chair on the veranda. "It's down at

leave It to evaporate in the sun, and
there isn't a horse to drag It up to the

"Where are Bones and Myope?"
"Erniles has them down working at

"I say ehe shall," cried Hill. "I'm

"All right! Go ahead and do It

seer and the manager never did hit

proved their tempers. "But stay," Pa
lon added, a thought striking him. "I'll
try what I can do first-" ; Vrvv
With that Paton went down to the
pdddock, caught Angel, harnessed her,
put her in the cart, and then coaxed
her to drag the load. By striving and
straining, she dragged the cart a few
steps through the heavy sand, then
paused and turned her eyes on Paton
entreatingly as though to say:
"I'd do it for you, but I can't."
Hill was watching the performance
from the .veranda, for the house was
built on the top of the sand hill, the
dam was in the creek at its foot, and
no bushes intervened. When the man
ager saw the horse stop he got up and
went quickly down. ',
"What's the matter?" he asked.
"It's just as I said," answered Paton,
"the mare hasn't the strength to haul
such a load."
"Hasn't she? I'll see about that It's
her dâd 'obstinacy, that's what It is.

"No! She'll haul the tank as it is!"
"Then I'll wash my hands, of the

Paton walked, up the slope. As he
stepped on the veranda, Mrp. Hill, who
was standing at the door, looked' back
into the house and called to her yotmg
cousin:
"Muriel, come out and see this brute!
She won't pull the tank up the hill, but
Horacfe will goon make her. He knows
how to manage horses." And eheshot.
a .scornful glance in Paton's direction.
Muriel Everton came out. She was a
tall, slender girl, dressed in white. Her
delicate throat was bare and her cheeks*
blanched by the heat, but her beautiful
brown eyes were clear and deep and;
tender. She and Paton exchanged quick
glances, then she looked down at the
man and the horse, shuddered and
turned away...
'Hill, by thrashing. the chestnut, had
forced her to haul the cart a few steps,
then Angel stopped. With kindness she
might have made a further but
Hill had aroused her obstinate spirit
and she would not budge an inch. This
infuriated . the man and he- beat her
over the head with the butt of the

her, in her agony she stepped back

the tank fell out. the cover rolled off
and the whole of the five hundred gal

horse from the' cart, and, Insane with
rage, commenced. to thrash her again.
. Then there was a sudden rush of
something white, as though a cloud
were flying down the hill, arid v Muriel'
threw herself between Hill' and Angel,
Wasping the mare's head in her. arms,
and the heavy whip descended on the

Before Hill's" raised arm could- fall,

For a moment ; Hill's glance met the
stern eyes of the overseer, : then It wa

" "Muriel, are you â¢ there? â¢ â¢ Did ' I hit

Jy. Did it hurt?"
"Hurt!" cried Paton, his eyes fairly
blazing. "Do you know that you might

. "She shouldn't have interfered," said
Hill, sullenly. ' . . .
â¢ "Not another word, or, by heaven I'll
kill you," said Paton. Hill shrank from
the furv in the other man's eyes, and
slunk away to;the house.
"My darling," said Paton in a voice
so fraught with love that the girl's
heart quivered with a joy that was al
most pain, "did j he hurt you very
much?" Arid his lips tenderly pressed
the bruised shoulder. "
. 1 "It does hurt most- awfully, but I
really think that 'he did riot know I

up through her tearsr -"But," oh, look at

sand, was truly.' a pitiable sight She
had won out, Indeed, but ."at what a

her head. "But nowâ nowâ you'll let me

Again Muriel looked up, and his eyes

"But how would you remedy It?" some one inquired.
"I can't remedy it â and I wouldn't. It would be an inter

It is still alive in the minds of smart men, that a good big
part of the human family was born to be damned, and I
reckon It was intended that a certain number of marriages
were Intended to be failures. And marriage is more of a
failure now than ever before, because there are more people
to get married. The more folks the more misery. If a man
and a woman do the best they can and their marriage turns
' out bad it can't be helped. Divorce is a blight on society, it
f is true, but to live with somebody that afn't suited to you ia
at blight on the mind and the heart. We may have a good
many lives to live, of that we can't tell, but we do know of
one, and when that one is ruined, why we are in what the
black bear said to the trap â a â well, you know what sort
of a fix. All the wisdom now known to men might be poured
on marriage and. wouldn't help it much. I know it's
P called high morality to talk against' divorces, and divorces
do show a loose state of affairs, but what's to be done? Two
enemies livin* together ain't likely to have writ in their
hearts, 'God bless our home,' and a home that the Lord
don't ; bless ain't a comfortable seat for society.

responsibility of a family and that develops a weakness of char

SThe claim put forward on behalf of a New York physician
for an original treatment of consumption, by nose surgery must
be regarded as concerning the manner of the manipulation
rather, than its. substance. For the operation of reducing the
lower turbinated bone- is fairly common, though he would be a
daring surgeon who would venture. to tamper with it. when its
condition is normal. .*"â  The trouble Is that in the climate of" the
Atlantic seaboard few noses are normal. Constant catarrh closes
. the nasal passages/so that mouth breathing becomes frequent or
.even habitual, and this crippling of the air providing machinery does
Invite consumption. In such cases remarkable cures have been effected
simply by enlarging the nasal cavities â cutting away either degenerate
tissue, if that exists, or a portion of the turbinated bone. The operation is
often undertaken, as in the case of Mr. Depew some years ago, where there 13
no danger whatever of .consumption, for the improvement . of the general
health.' Yet in th* consideration Of no disease 13 the danger of hobby-riding
greater than in consumption. It has no single cause; it has no single remedy.
Nose treatment is a quick, easy and valuable aid in its treatment, but cannot
supersede the function of fresh air and proper, diet under medical direction. â

THE CHAPLAIN'S WIT
By C. B. Lewis
ONE day at the Third, National
Bank in the city of Cornopolis,
a stranger walked through the
president's room and past; the
â¢ bookkeeper's and took from the
pile of money, stacked at the paying
teller's right hand four packages of
$10,000 each. He was coolly walking
out again when stopped by the presi
dent and a gun. -
â¢ The man was known to the police as
"Slick Charlie," and to tell of all his
adventures would fill a book. It was
for his attempted theft of the $40,000
that he was sent to the. Woonson Peni
tentiary for five years. The officer who
delivered- him behind the doors of that
institution said to the Warden:
"Here is a main you want to keep an
eye on. Don't lose sight of him day or
night. He is bold and nervy on the
one hand, and slick and sly on the
other. Don't trust him for an hour or
he'll beat the game."
If a prison chaplain were to be ques
tioned about religion in a prison, he
would answer that scores of prisoners
lived* up to it and were earnest and de
vout. If an" experienced Warden were
to be questioned, he would answer that
just when >a prisoner began to ; "get
good" he should be watched the closest.
The chaplain was a man 45 years old,
while No. 870 was only 30. The chap
lain was four .inches the taller, had
stoop shoulders and shambled as he
walked. He also had a peculiar intona
tion. The slick convict gave up his
original idea of digging for liberty to
study the chaplain. * At the end of five
months he was one of the teachers in
the evening school.
It was the habit of the chaplain to
visit the prison every . afternoon from
3 to 5. A part of the time was spent
with prisoners in their cellsâ men who
were undergoing -light punishment â
and a part in the library, and he al
ways left pretty promptly at 6. In
going out he passed three guards at
locked gates and went through the
Warden's office and out of the main
door. No. 870 had held the position
of librarian for three months, and it
was midwinter.' One afternoon the
chaplain had been visiting in the pris
on and returned to the library at a
quarter of .five. As he entered the
room he received a blow that knocked
him senseless, and when he recovered
his wits half an hour had passed and
he was tied hand and foot and gagged.
It was 6 o'clock before he was released.
In the course of that hour *<o. 870
had done some wonderful things. After
knocking down the chaplain he had
stripped off the latter's outer garments
and clothed himself In them. Then ha
had secured his man with ropes and
locked the door behind him as he
emerged. Shambling down the corridor
to 'the first guard, he had said:
"James. I came away to-day wth
only a dime In my pocket. Can you
loan me a dollar until to-morrow?"
"With the greatest of pleasure, chap
lain," and the money had been handed
over.
The same gamÂ© had been played on
the two other^, and then the "chap
lain" had entered tb$ Warden's office.
He could have passed right through.
as the official was busy, but instead of
that he took a chair and waited for
ten minutes. When the Warden was
at liberty he was asked for a loan of
$10, and the "chaplain" reported to him
on the welfare of three or four different
prisoners before saying good-night.
Fifteen minutes after leaving the prison
the disguised prisoner entered the
largest store in the town and borrowed
$20 of the merchant and then dis
appeared.
When the library door was broken
open at 6 o'clock and the real chaplain
found there was a great commotion.
Three gatemen were ready to swear
that the clergyman had passed out.
taking a dollar from each as he did
so. The Warden had -seen and talked
and loaned money to the same man,
Two guards had also seen him. Here
were six prison officials who could
swear to a thing, and yet that thing
was not a fact. No. 870 had simply
imitated the chaplain down to a lineâ
his voice, gait, speech and general look.
At 11 o'clock the next rorenoon the
president of the Third National Bank
of Cornopolis was called out of his
room for a moment. During bis ab
sence a man dressed like one of the
clerks in the bank entered the room
and bore away a -package of bond3 of
the face value of $18,000. "Slick Char-
He" wanted to be revenged upon the
bank, and he wanted money with which
to leave the country, and he tarried
in the town to get both. The president
of the bank 'is sure of this because a,
note left on hia desk told him so.

WANT TO KNOW
' *~Y ACH day witnesses sacrifices of
_/ every sort and description
I f and the question is, is it
1 \ ' worth while and are the :e-
V, suits what one would alwa\*s
Wish for?
A country lassie writes me her par
ents are willing to send her here to
school, but that it will be a grr^nt
hardship to them if she accepts their
kindly offer. Her wardrobe is inade
quate and both her father and mother
v.-ill have to sacrifice a good many lux
uries and comforts to fill her trunk I
â with the pretty frills and furbelows
\hat are considered essential for city
life. Knowing all this she asks. 'What
would you do?"
Without thinking a moment one
would be very apt to say "stay at
â¢ home." but which of the two "evils
would inflict the sharper *pain. All
the little comforts would be passed by
cheerfully and ; uncomplainingly and
there would be a certain air of sat
isfaction permeating the ranchhouse.
because "daughter was having city ad
vantages." On the other hand, if
daughter felt the sacrifice too great
and refused to profit by it. the eternal
regret and constant reminders that
fche had not made the most of her op
portunities might be a bug-bear that
would grow until it would soon be too
U:rge to corcfortablv house.
Education is undoubtedly a good
thing, but I think sometimes the
costs are too great and that more mis
vry ai.rt urihappiness are the fruits of
It than anything else. Certainlv it
irould be a mistaken kindness to send
.his girl to school and college and
.then expect her to be content with the
â¢ hur.icrum life of a farm or a small
' village. It simply won't work and I
scarcely see who* could Â«xpect it to.
Unoe she has lived in a coilc-ge town
and breathed its atmosphere for a
number of years â in short, has lived
tn-.- happy life of a student â she is out
of sympathy with her old surround
ings, and try as hard as she may, can
never fit into her old niche with the
same dÂ«-srp<: of comfort.
it Isn't that she doesn't care exactly,
but the tsout cf tune with "everybody
ar.d everything. What has interested
her for yean is like so much Grtck to
the home folks and she is not !n the
least interested over Brir.dle's r.ew calf
â¢ or the lact that the iirigating water Is
getting low. So gradually it dawns on
the dear o!d dad that all his efforts
have been in vain: that his many sac
rifices have counted for wc-rse than
naught. Instead of making his pet
daughter happier and a scurce of pride
to himself, he has only succeeded in
orecting a barrier between them and in
converting contentment into the very
essence of woes.
So when edupatic-n 5s bought at such
a price as that, does it really pay? It's
a woeful position to be between two
fires and not know which way to turn.
Nine and ninety times it's back to the
â¢ farm and the other one a career of
some kind or a happy marriage. In
cither event the alienation takes place,
but the one is the kind that makes all
worth while.
It isn't so much the sacrifices that
count as it is the after results. Nearly
every father and mother give up some
trifle daily and do it without a second's
thought. In fact, it is rather a habit
they have fallen into and they never
etop to wonder whether it is appreci
ated or rot.
Where is the mother who would not
eit up half the night sewing on a gown
that her daughter might appear at her
best at a reception the next day? And
If the exchequer is loo low to permit
new material and the old is too far
gone to reconstruct, she heaves a tiny
-Gigh of regret and marches to the old
fashioned chest and brings forth some
r.i her cherished wedding finery. As
the handles the lavender-scented fabric
the smiles wistfully now and then as
the past is recalled, but she sews
bravely en. and even puts the last lin
gering touches and pats to It as she
rteps aside and watches her daughter
trip away with a light "thank you,
mother." or a careless nod. that is
meant to convey a little of everything
and not much of anything.
Is that sacrifice appreciated? Not
very often, I am sorr>; to say. Rather
It Is taken quite as a matter of course
and as nothing more than her natural
due. "What on earth does mother
want to hoard all her pretty things
lor? She Is too old to need them any
more. and. besides, she never goes any
place."
That may be true, but the reason of
her sticking at home like a burr Is
never inquired into, excepting once In
an age, when her presence is needed or
particularly desired. "You never have
anything to wear. Why don't you get
a decent coat and cover your gown?"
And the plaintive answer that "you
needed a new dress for the Smith-Jones
tall" brings forth nothing more re-
EponsU'e than a disjointed series of
Ribbons, shoes, hats, in short, any
thing Is promptly and readily unearth
ed and passed over to the dictatorial
one when she is putting on her war
paint and preparing to go to battle with
all her sails set. Â£he may have been
told a 'dozen and one times that her
â¢gloves needed cleaning." or that her
"petticoat had a torn bit of lace." but
!n the mad rush to have a (rood time
the trusted to luck that somebody
would do it for her, and besides there
was always the opportunity of bor
rowing.
Does mother ever refuse to aid the
cause? Instead of standing ud and de
claring that thje had wasted her breath
giving warning and that Mary Ann
could go without, she brines forth her
own spotless gloves or freshly laun
. dered skirt And finds to her dismay
a couple of days later on that she is
destitute of nearly everything, and un
less* she lives near town she is obliged
to stay at home and twist her thumbs
the live-Ion? af terroon. instead of find
ing out how other mothers manasre
their daughters.
Even "daddy" is a victim. He suc-
cumbs to her pretij >-.les and promlso
fondly and loelish'.y, and then luuks
about for a way to keep his word. .He
"guesses his office suit will last a
month longer if sent to the tailor to be
thoroughly pressed." or he reasons out
with himself "that the duck trio will
be cold and disagreeable and not much
fun, anyhow." By giving up a looked
for pleasure the day has been won. and
Miladi has a new fur. gives a theater
party or trails about in yards of shim
mering loveliness and looks the uer
ponineation of all the graces and vir
tues combined.
Now and then she Is really ignorant
of these little tricks of her people and
would feel her.rt:ly ashamed of herself
for her supreme selfishness, and when
such is the case you may rest assured
that the sacrifica has town a pleasure
and the satisfaction of seeing the
daughter of the house take her place
In the world, radiant and happy, is
more than enough compensation.
Of the many sacrifices that occur
daily I doubt if time and labor are not
the least considered. There must al
ways be one elegant lady of leisure in
every household, end, or course, it is
easy to guess who" it is. "I don't mind
doing the dishes this evening as long
as you are going out." is cheerfully
announced as the mater years a tray
kitchenward. "You go along . and
dress." The next day John Brown Is
expected to call just after lunch and
it would never do for him to discover
that his dainty Dresden china ideal
was nothing more or less than the maid
of all work. So again the dishes fall
to mother, and she Is even requested to
"put a few flowers in the living-room
if you have time."
Later on the house is filled with
young people, who chatter, sing, play
the piano, dance, in fact, do every
thing they can think of to make a
noise and keep the rest of the house
hold awake, and In the midst of it,
mother la requested to sneak softly
down the back stairs, make chocolate,
prepare a tray and make herself quite
as useful and as helpful as . is pos-,
sible. "Don't let anybody see you,"
she is instructed, "for that old dress
is a perfect fright."
These are all daily occurrences and
furthermore happen in many house
holds, yet are not looked upon as sac
rifices of any eort. "Dad" is a' crank
if he Insists on quiet because he -has
developed a case of nerves from.get
ting along on forty winks for months
at a stretch, and "Ma"' Is another be
cause she refuses to have three or
four In to dinner every other night In
the week. "It's a little extra work, but
then we have to eat any way. so
where's the harm?".
Giving up for others is a continual
process, and " whether* - It 'is worth
while depends wholly upon Individual
cases. It is no*t the actual sacrifice
that counts half as much as the spirit
in which it is received. If an education
is offered and one feels one can accept
it and be the better for it later on, or
that one can make the lives of others
happier by it. then I say take it by all
means, for after all happiness and con
tentment are what count more than all
else, but. If on the other hand, there' is
the shadow of a doubt lurking in one's
brain, then that sacrifice Is a mighty
good thing to reject and to let strictly
alone. . "â¢-..â¢ -~

MAKING OVER FURS
FURS are a bit of a problem for a
woman who wants to dres3 well
on a moderate sum of money.
They are expensive to begln
wilh and vary In style almost as often
as frocks and hats do. There 1Â» a new
cut In sleeves every winter, a different
length, a* variation in collar and some
novalty in lining. Furs used to be a
real comfort. *You packed them away
with" blankets and curtains and borax
powder to 'outwit the moths and all
you bad to' do , In' the fall. was to
shako, them, hans them out to air
and then be comfortable.
But â¢ nowadays women begin > in.
August to wonder how they can set
their furs up to date without bank
rupting the family exchequer. For
furriers are as heartless as plumbers
and almost as essential to' happiness.
Of course this fall's furs differ a good
deal from last season's, but here Ij a
word of comfort: they "suggest all
sorts of practical schemes for the ar
tistic remodeling of old garments.
Almost all furs are trimmed or made
up with other furs. Ermine is com
bined with almost everything but
seal, deer and baby calf skin: chin
chilla combines with seal nicely, espe
cially the Russrian chinchilla, which,
has a brownish coat. â _ It is also used
with deer and mink, with Persian
lamb and fine dogskin. Usually the
light fur is the trimming, but squirrel.'
beaver, tibet and mole skin* are air
very smart trimmed wjth Iamb or
with' monkey skin. When 'furs
are not - combined any fur may
be trimmed with suede leather, or for
dressy occasions . with embroidery.
This use of leather is nsw and you
have no Â«idea what a smart touch it
gives an old coat put over collar, cuffs
or v set in a double-breasted tailor vest.
It comes In all the dull ' vegetablu
dyes, in hunting green, golf red, ma
hogany, bluet blue, navy blue and
every conceivable shade of" browni
light and' dark. Sometimes it is em
broidered With outline work in gold
thread or silk.
The embroideries most in. vogue for
fur trimmings are straps from old

chestnuts, boiled and chopped fine, a
good sized lump of butter, one tea
spoonful of grated onion, salt and
pepper and a large tablespoonful of
sage and four teaspoonfula of parsley
chopped very fine.
EVA (Eyebrows). â No matter how
obstinate your brows are you can
train them so they will lie close and
smooth to the skin. Get a tiny brush
and train them every day and in a

Rsd vaseline, ounces 2
Tincture cantharldes, ounces. 1
Jamaica rum, ounce 1
Oil rosemary, drops 5
Mix all thoroughly: apply twice
daily* with the eye brush.
A little glycerin, and rose water
will give the delicate line emphasis
and brilliancy, and when the brows
are healthy again you will find it all
that is necessary to keep them in
splendid condition.

GREAT HOPES OF DUCHESS D'AOSTA ARE DISPELLED
BY BIRTH OF A SON TO THE KING OF ITALY.
WARRIOR AND BANDIT
FOR HUNDRED YEARS
SERVIAN METMUSELflH'S' LIFE
Lives at Ease on What He Has Been Able
to Save From His Plunderings.
BELGRADE, Dec. 24.â Besides being
one of the oldest men in the world.
Ftojan Ziklts-Gyurgytis, the Servian
Methuselah, who has just celebrated" his
one hundred and seventeenth birthday,
has had an extraordinary career. Most
of his life has been spent in fighting
against the Turks. For many years,
however, he was a bandit, and he now*
rejoices that by combining thrift with
robbery he saved enough from his
plunderings to live in ease for the rest
cf his> days. When asked, recently, if
he was not tired of life this venerable
and impenitent sinner replied: "As long
as I am able to drink my portion of
roky (whisky) and wine I shall be only
too glad to be on this side of the world."
Stojan was only seventeen when he
first took up arms against the Turks.
That was a hundred years ago when
the grandfather of "Black Peter," the
present Servian King, proclaimed a
revolution against them. Joining' the
revolutionists, Stojan fought In several
battles until a saber wound nearly
cost him his life. He paid back that
score with interest a hundredfold.
On his recoverv, by the most sacred
of Servian oaths, he swore a vendetta
against the Turks. Returning to his
home he organized a band of haj
duks (robbers) and ravaged and pil
laged several Turkish villages, putting
the Inhabitants to death, for it is part
of his creed that the only good Turk
is a dead Turk.
HOSTILE TO THE TURKS.
Still, to give the picturesque ruffian
his due, he always preferred legitimate
warfare against the Turks to fighting
them on his own account. In 1823 he
found a chance whenÂ»Â»he Greeks were
struggling for independence, and Join
ing a band of Janitsars. under the lead
ership of the famous Saip Bey, he
greatly distinguished himself. He re
mained in Greece for some time, after it
had been proclaimed a kingdom, but
the Turks had put a big price on his
head and they managed to get hold of
him. His captors wanted to make an
object lesson of him and decided to
postpone executing him until the thing
could be done in style before a big
crowd.
Agile as a mountain goat and as
cunning as a fox, Stojan slipped
through their fingers* and fled to Bel
grade. There he met the future Prince,
Milosh Obrenovits. and tried to get him
to start another revolution against
Turkey. A year later he went to SL
Petersburg and was received by ; the
Czar Alexander II, to whom he present
ed a memorial depicting the woeful
condition of the Servians and begging
the Czar to intervene in their behalf
against their "hated oppressors.
The Czar was not ready to play that
sort of same Just then, and, returning
io Servia, Stojan turned bandit again.
I3y preference he always chose Turks
for his victims, but he would not fly
in the face of providence by neglecting
any opportunity that offered to make
a pood haul elscv. here. He had several
hair-breadth oscapes. but always man
aged to a\*oid capture, being assisted
by the peasantry, who regarded his oc
cupation as a* legitimate and eminently
respectable one.
Us was SO years of aje, when, in 1876,
the Serbo-Turkish war broke out, but
he.. was. not too old to. take' part in it.
The Servian commander, General Uzum
Mirkovits, sent him on a special mis
sion vto ascertain the.- strength of the
Turkish forces and he succeeded .in ob
taining the needed information. At the
conclusion of the war he retired from
the bandit business and settled down at
Nish to enjoy the rewards of his preda
tory industry and untroubled by any
conscientious scruples concerning his
past life.
His appetite is still good, . his teeth
sound and his eyesight clear. His mem
ory is excellent, and he vividly recalls
six good chances that he missed to kill
that number of Turks. If he had his
life to live over again he is sure, he
says, there would be-no such failures
to reproach himself with in his old age.
He was ( twice married . and has three
daughters livingâ the oldest 80 and'the
youngest 40. .
AMERICANS GIVE AID
TO THE ENGLISH POOR
Young Mrs. Bradley Mam in Responds
Liberally to the Charitable
. %'jlfÂ£%: Appeals. .. ; t ,
LONDON, Dec. 24.â Following the ex
ample of Lady Craven, : young Mrs.
Bradley Martin has already commenced
to take an active Interest in charitable
institutions that devote their efforts to
the relief of distress among indigent old
people. She has no sympathy with the
EngliBh poorhouse system, by. which
old married couples are separated as
soon as they become chargeable to the
ratepayers. â¢/â¢'.*
. It has been the custom in recent years
to solicit subscriptions from wealthy
people to provide some measure of
Christmas cheer for the poor in the
workhouses. Such "luxuries" can be
obtained only through voluntary sup
port, because the Government will not
sanction, any extra expediture that
might involve the general ratepayers.
When Miss Phipps was appealed to
a few weeks ago for 'a subscription to
provide an entertainment at Christmas
for the inmates of one of the' Scotch
poorhouses she quietly; told the collec
tor that she would be always happy to
contribute if there was a guarantee that
husbands and wives were allowed to
share the same. table on Christmas day.
The collector could give no snch guar
antee and had to go away without any
assistance.- â¢
Mrs. Bradley Martin and Lady.Cra
ven have always responded to such
charitable ; appeals liberally, but . . it
would appear that Mrs.. Bradley Martin
Jr. prefers to support places like Naza

are allowed to â¢ enjoy ; each other's so

not be found among those who Indulge

SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 25, 1904.
WOMAN HAS
PUBLISHED
200 NOVELS
Remarkable List
to tne Credit of
Mrs.Meafle. 1
LONDON, Dec. 24.â Mrs. L. T. Meade,
whose new novel, "Love Triumphant,'^
has just been published, is probably the
most prolific of English women writers.
Mrs. Meade has been writing for so
long, and with so much success that
her name must be familiar to American
readers; but they may, not know that
she has published over two hundred
novels.
As the imposing list of her works at
the â¢ British Museum shows, Mrs.
Meade's versatility is almost as strik
ing as her productiveness, for this list
includes stories of domestic interest,
quiet in tone; stories that are frankly
sensational; stories ef religious interest
and stories for. boys and girls. Some of
this author's books, however, have been
written in collaboration â notably with
Robert Eustaceâ a case in point being
"The Brotherhood of the Seven Kings,"
which attracted so much attention
when published serially in the. Strand
Magazine.
There is much in getting an early
start, which Mrs. Meade certainly did,
her first novel having been published
when she was 17;
She is the child of an Irish clergyman
and pretty nearly anything would have
been more to her parents' liking than
her decision to earn her living by
story-writing. But the girl was deter
mined and at 18 she came to London,
and almost from the start found a
ready market for her wares. Fertile of
imagination, before three â  years â  had
passed, she had over a dozen books to
her credit.
She is now married and has three
children, but in spite of domestic duties,
admirably performed, Mrs. Meade keeps
grinding out fiction ; more industriously
and "more successfuly than ever." He;'
"Stories From the Diary of a Doctor,",
written with . Robert Eustace; "The
Sanctuary Club" and "A Race With the
Sun," are famous, on this side of the
water. Even to : day Mrs. Meade thinks
nothing of : turning out 8000 words a
day, most of her matter, however, being
dictated to a secretary.
;, The title of her newbook, "Love
umphant." was suggested by that of
the: picture by the late G.F. Watts. In

Contest for the Throne Results in Bitter
Feud Between Ambitious Mothers.
ROME, Dec. 24.â It is rather-doubt
ful is- the world contains -at- present a
more disappointed and dejected mother
than the Duches d' Aosta, 'whose fondest
hppe^that of seeing her eldest son ac
claimed King of Italyâ haV been shat
tered -by, the | birth of an heir to the
present -King. ... . ... ."
When the Duke d'Aosta begged. her to
marry him. nine - years ago, '>* the
Duchossâ then . Princess Helene oVOr
leansâasked only one question. :. That
was, "Will the Prince of Naples ever
marry?" The then Prince of Naples is
the' present King, arid " his cousin,
d'Aodta, stood next in â¢ line ' for the
throne. . . . . '.â ' . '."â â¢â¢ '
"No," replied the latter. ."Victor will
never "marry. He has an. absolute ;ob
tiorrence of the idea, so I shall undoubt
edly be sovereign. He is delicate v and
weak, and I shall outlive himi jAny
way,' if I have a' son, he will sit on -the
throne." So the Princess Helene said
"yes," and her marriage to the Duke
took place soon after.- . - * . .
. BEGINNING" OF.. FEUD. ,
One year later, before any." child v had
blessed the union, the Prince of : Naples
suddenly, fell in love with Princess Hel
ene 6f Montenegro, and,' to â¢ the secret
horror of the d'Aostas,' married her. At

his eyes in a chamber totally and im

wealth of his titles. Among them will
be the high-sounding one of King of
Cyprus, Crete and Jerusalem, but at
present he only has one, Prince of Pied

Queen Helene is devoted to children. A
story is told of how she could not even

while her eyes filled with tears. The
little boy. then about a year old, laid
his Ups on each of her eyelids, strok

California. Rose Valley, Placer, Mis

convention in Sacramento under the
auspices of California Temple No. 1.
The meeting place presented a festive

officers being banked with flowers of
the color of the station, and a holiday
appearance was added to the place by
the liberal use of winter greens and
hollyberrles. The representatives to
the convention were met by a commit

at noon, and an hour later an excel

ernoon the convention was called to

Two trunks containing wardrobe es
sential to the Gadski's phvsical comfort
-r.d peace of mind when she ventures
abroad had been forwarded to- the Ho
le! uel Lionte, Monterey, instead of to
the Hotel St. Francis, Ss.n Francisco,
and as the blunder was apologetically
revealed to the car.tatrice I awaited a
temper-break that would have been
pardonable on the part of any woman
EiralUurly situated. But it did not come.
The strong Teutonic features never re
laxed the smile they wore when the tale
of misfortune was commenced, and the
only comment was one of quizzical
wonder.
"To Monterey?" she said serenely.
'"But we're not going to Monterey. How
strange the trunks should go there.
I'm ecrry they did not come here, be
cause I must do Christmas shopping
this afternoon with my little daughter.
But maybe I have something here that
will do to wear."
A deepening of the Emile dismissed
the subject, and I remembered a re
mark anent the Gadski temperament
uttered by Mr. Maurice Grau when he
was here three years ago and sorely
harassed by the capriciousness of some
of his song birds. Calve was sulking at
Pasadena, Mibyl Sanderson lay sick at
the Palace, Eames was threatened with
a sore throat, and the impresario, saw
money returned at the Grand Opera
house box office.
â¢"Ah." he said, "if they all were like
Gadskiâ she's the reliable." And the
remainder of that memorable season
bore out his opinion. Of the entire
aviary there were only two of the
prima donne â Gadski and Sembrich â
who did not cancel one or more appear
ances, convey disappointment to the
public and corresponding pecuniary loss
to their manager. Gadskl sang oftener
than any of her sister artists.
Since then she has lost none of the
big, wholesome personality that illumed
the stage and endeared her\o all whom
she met In a social way. That the
friendships then formed have endured
was indicated by her frequent Inquiries
about persons and the many greetings
conveyed to her by mail and telephone
and handshake. The center table of
her apartment at the St. Francis was a
litter of letters locally posted and visit
ing cards and floral tributes. So often
was our interview interrupted by the
tinkling of the telephone bell that she
almost showed annoyance.
"My husband. Mr. Tauscher, isn't
here yetâ won't arrive till Christmas
r.ight." the explained, "so inquiries for
him are referred to me by the hotel
people. How is he? Well, he's the
busiest man in this country. The
Government at Washington has finally
adopted the big guns he represents."
It is Gadski's first extensive concert
tour and she has found it more agree
able than she anticipated. Her con
tract to sing opera for Conried called
for three years' servitude, but at the
<nd of the first twelvemonth he inaug
urated his now famous retrenchment
Policy and she would not submit to the
proposed salary reduction. Therefore
the covenant was of his breaking.
â "An offer to appear In sixty concerts
en tour promised greater pecuniary
compensation than Mr. Conried's re
duced rate would have afforded me,"
she said, "and here I am with sixteen
of the sixty behind me. But the series
threatens to be almost doubled, for ten
of the sixteen have resulted in return
engagements. When we started out I
thought of the brief stays in each place
and the almost constant traveling, but
now I actually prefer the concert.plat
form to the operatic stage, despite" 1 the
drawbacks to ease-finding that I
feared."
It being my turn to say something,
I lamely asked If the having of an
audience all to oneself, instead of di
viding its possession with other artists,
did not make up to a great extent, if
not entirely, for one-night stands and
attendant discomforts.
"I hope I am not so selflsh as to de
rive satisfaction from that source,"
â¢was her response, and the accompany
ing eye-twinkle made me yearn for in
stant opportunity to indulge in self
kicking. "Of course, I would much
rather sing alone than be associated
with a poor tenor or any other defec
tive artist or artists, but the preference
is in consideration for the audience as
well as myself. You see, when there is
a weak spot in an operatic cast it af
flicts the public by impairing the work
cf the other principals. It discourages
them â makes them feel that the per
formance is faulty â and some of them
may allow the hopelessness of trying
to make the performance creditable to
lead them into carelessness. Now that
feeling has never hampered me. The
weaker the cast the more earnestly I
have striven to redeem the perform
anceâto give the public its money's
worth and help the man who pays the
Ealaries. A conscientious artist could
not, I believe, make the public conven-
After a moment's reflection she
vouchsafed a theory, and it was log
ical.

EDWIN DEAKIN'S OLD MISSION PAINTINGS
Small wonder that in San Francisco,
enthroned 'twixt turquoise seas, upon
seven emerald hills, whose slopes are
peopled with the children of every
'clime, a type of art should be born and
be reared to clever maturity under
sympathetic direction. How the hills
have cry^a! lized the art sense of our
people! Even as in Italy â whose god
child Is California â they whose eyes
sec and whose hearts feel are mag
netized by the soft, voluptuous slopes
cf the city to seek to set up their
easels in some eyrie thereabouts.
The environment of the artist., the
vriter, or the composer directly in
fluences his mental poise, which in
turn dictates the type of work he
evolves. Hence the necessity of sym
pathetic location.
This, in a measure, explains to tha
stranger the concentration of studios

Orientals â .". precious heritage- of sus-.

ience subservient to his or her own."
When I quoted popular opinion, that
in both drama and opera the more In
adequate the "support" the more bril
liantly does the star shine by contrast
the smile developed into a laugh.
"That may be so," she said, "but
such 'stars' are not conscientious ar
tists."
Then we fell to discussing the pres-"
ent individual doings of that great
Grau galaxy of three years ago. When
I told of how Schumann-Heink's first
appearance in concert here was to a
two-thirds house, and of how hundreds
of folk were turned away from her
final one because of Manager Green
baum's inability to provide them even
with standing room, for which they of
fered fancy prices, the honest face
glowed with satisfaction.
"And with Sembrich," I continued,
"It was just the opposite! Her concert
debut In San Francisco was made to
the big and cultured congregation and
her final performance, barely justified
the managerial outlay."
popular heart," she said, "by arrang
ing her programmes to appeal to all
phases of refined musical taste. She
sang homely songs, as well as preten
tious arias, and the people were quick
to find it out and respond. Sembrich
may have been too unvaryingly class
ical In her selections, and the people
may have been quick to find that out,
too."
Gadski had not seen Fritzi-Scheff In
light opera, and the omission did rot
seem to occasion regret.
"She has decided to revive some of
the comic opera successes of a score of
years ago, and she Is wise to do that,"
was the big woman's verdict on the
petite woman's latest venture. "Since
the time 'Fatinitza* was composed
nothing of its class has been con
structed to equal it musically, and It
would not surprise me to see a renais
sance of Its style. Modern comic opera
is more f#rce than music"
Melba's recent physical breakdown
in PIttsburg. necessitating cancella
tion of her concert engagement there,
wa6 briefly discussed, and then we
drifted back to Gadski's self.
"Opera work is more nerve-wearing
than concert singing." she said. "In
opera there is the changing of t cos
tumeâsometimes half a dozen changes
during one performance â the waiting
for cues, the uncertainty as to how
your stage associates will suit you,
and various other things to keep your
nerves at tension. Then there is the
spirit of your role, which you must
cherish even while you are not singing
It. With one of the heavy Wagnerian
parts to sustain, such as Elizabeth or
Brunhilde, you cannot afford to cast
off your simulation when you exit and
don it when you enter, as you do your
wardrobe, but must 'feel* it every in
stant the opera is in progress. In con
cert, however, you can safely change
your moods with your numbersâalter
nately laugh and cry, as it were â and
the mutations of feeling are good for
you. That's one of my reasons for
preferring concert â its comparative
lack of demand on the nerves."
"And your programmesâ are they
mixed, a la Schumann-Heink, or
straight, a la Sembrich?"
"As varied as my talent will permit."
This from the woman who was capa
ble of stepping in and singing any
leading role in the vast Grau reper
toire gave promise of variety illimita
ble.
""With Wagner first choice, I pre
sume?**
"Not too much Bayreuth," she
laughed. "If my choice alone were
consulted, perhaps Wagner would be
more In evidence, but in music appre
ciation there . are differing . ideas, and
each of them must be taken into con
sideration with the arrangement of a
concert t. which 'the general public is
invited."
Miss Tauscher, 11 years of age, home
in Berlin, was then yielded maternal
attention, and the ensuing active prep
arations for a shopping excursion indi
cated that the tale of the trunks was
not such a thriller, after all.

This- deliveranceâ perfectly sound as
far as it- goes, but which does not go
far, enough â has provoked a rejoinder
from Mr. Laurence Irving, representing
the modern school. He says that auth
ors, actors and the public, during the
last -thirty years "have, it seems to me,
been busily combining to establish a
dra,ma'tic-literature for their own age.
They" fh*a.ve at last tugged the drama
off- the, shoals on which it lay stranded
during the epoch of Bulwer Lytton and
Sheridan". Knowles; they have broken
the hypnotic trance into which the daz
zling and; facile genius of Shakespere
had thrown the English stagro, during
the first half of the nineteenth century.

It will not _be read for a decade after it
has vanished from the stage. It is just
because the modern stage literature is
so ephemeral and worthless that all
true lovers" of the theater are so anx
ious that the ancient standards should
not be utterly forgotten.
No one has any objection to the de
velopment of a modern prose drama. A
new Sheridan or Goldsmith would be
welcomed very heartily. Mr. Pinero and
Mr. Jones, are both clever men, but
their joint product does not satisfy all
possible theatrical aspirations.

Nat Goodwin has signed a three years'

comedy by W. W. Jacobs and Louis N.
Parker. Mr. Goodwin will appear in a
character after tha style of those in
which he achieved his earliest and sta
blest fame. He will be supported by an
American. company. Arrangements for
the production were completed with
Daniel Frohman, and it has been set

says the Dramatic Mirror. Aside from
the very few prominent actors now be
fore the public who abhor the idea of
continuing for long periods in a single
play, who emphasize their distinguished
abilities by appearing in various dra
mas during a" season, and who possess
the capacity and skin necessary to train
their supporting actors in something
like a variety of impersonation, there
remains no other medium but that fur
nished by the few stock companies
which hold'precarlous tenures in vari
ous cities for actors to become in some
measure expert In their art. These
stock companies, although they are
held in contempt by the dominant pow

players who insist upon > their j own
method, really save the theater of to

MRS. SPENDER-CLAY KNOWN
AS EXPERT JUDGE OF LACE
Astor's Daughter Able to Make Intri
cate Designs as Result
of Study.
LONDON, Dec. 22.â It has just been
discovered by her friends that Mrs.
Spender-Clay is one of the best Judges
of old lace in Europe. The dealers have
known it for a long time, because she
has frequently exposed their imposi
tions.
Shortly after the announcement of
her engagement an American friend,
who kne.v of Miss Astor's partiality for
specimens of good old lace, was enlarg
ing on the beauty of a sample which
she had just bought from a dealer. It
was the lady's Intention to present the
piece of lace to the bride as a wedding
present. Miss Astor, without a mo
ment's hesitation, described the sample
as not lace at all, but a poor German
copy of a genuine Irish design. The
friend collapsed. She told Miss Astor
that she had paid an enormous price
for it.
"Go and get your money back," said
Miss Astor; "if the dealer is worth
powder and shot he will not hesitate;
if he Is not, you can ; , consider your
money lost."
Few people know how she obtained
her extraordinary knowledge of lace.
She lias paid frequent visits to Lim
erick, the center of the lace industry . In
Ireland, and has sat for hours at a
time watching the girls In the convent
schools there while they were at work.
She has made some intricate designs
herself, and If she had to she could
earn a handsome living as a lace
worker. While she Is an expert In Irish
lace !t would be difficult to deceive her
In Spanish. Maltese. Egyptian or Arme
nian specimens. Her admiration for
Irish laceworkers has caused her to
support the Industry most generously
from time to time.

"What next?" indeed!
First, came Corbinism, with its thun

love â which* is quite the safest and
Boost .respectable type of love that we
wot -of for young men, military or
otherwise. But v.ith the guns of rea

words. They are beginning to conclude
That his theory is right, after all; but
In practice, â pouf!
There, there, General Corbin, is where
you're wrong. You've left out a vital
point In your deduction. You forgot to
grathor in the element of human nature
â which, the sods be praised â is beyond
the glacial touch of Uncle Sam or his
man-servants. And note the plucky
chaps who, right under the noses of the
department Gorgons, have asked sweet
maiderts to be theirs â and got "yes" for
an answer. And there are others on
tbe tapis. Mark you weli, these winter
hops at the Presidio are prunis-'-rr well

mÂ£id in another. But list to an im
pending sorrow, already has a pall
falfcn over the glad, pray post at Fort
Wright, whence Spokane derives
her gayest beaux, for its smart flings,
and that gives the Washington burg a
certailr tone of stability â not to say
elegance, which is rather a big adjec
tive for a little map-spot like Spokane.
And herewith is the deep sorrow. Lis

themselves â well, they don't say much,
audibly. They still continue to discuss
the situation inaudibly â which mode of
conversation is much in vogue in the
army. It's safe.
Sci there we are, with a new assault
upon society by its most picturesque
ally. Lucky the navy hasn't grown
busy laying down blue laws for its ex
ponent*. Let us hope it has bigger
things to do. And let us likewise hope
that the Presidio officers will not be as

Appellations Supplied for Tier Sister's

Author.
LONDON, Dec. 24.â It is not general
ly known that Elinor Glyn, who wrote
"The Visits of Elizabeth." ia responsi
ble for a series of appellations which
added considerably to the; gaycty of
nations, not long ago. This was when
Lady Duff Gordon, who trades as a
milliner under the name of "Lucile. "
gave her famous exhibition of "emo

tles given to these weird creations were
startling. One was called, "The Dirga
O'er the Death of Pleasure," another
"A , Frenzied Song of "'Amorous
Things." Still others were "Incessant
Soft . Desire," "The Red Mouth of a
Venomous Flower" and "The Meaning

Every' one wondered who was the au

thought of Elinor Glyn, forgetting,
perhaps, that the author and Lady

GO TO PARLIAMENT
Lord Tumour, Oxford Student, Elected
Labor Leader Also Chosen
LONDON. Dec. 24.â Two Parliamen
tary bye-elections have just taken
I'lace which are of, more than passing
interest because of the striking con
;rasts presented by the successful can
didates and the exhibitions they afford
pf the diverse conditions under which
â¢â¢ntrance to the House of Commons is
'obtained. One of the new members is

Sussex, Viscount Tumour won a vic
tory for the Conservative party.
Richards is forty-nine years old. He
received little, schooling as a youngster
and at twelve years of age was set to
work in a colliery. He employed his!
scanty leisure to repair the defects of
.Wf limited education, but from ex
perience he learned far more than from
book*. He won leadership among his
fellow workmen in the coal fields by his
superior ability and the confidence in- i
f-jired by his sterling integrity. !
in labor troubles with the owners of j
thfe-coal mines he was frequently put
;'< :rw*ard as the spokesman of the wage
â¢ air.ers. b,m his influence was invari
ably exercised on the side of restraint
r~uber â¢nan of incitement. As a labor
leader he is distinguished by his mod- ]
'â¢â¢-ation: as a speaker, by his mastery

On theory of representative gov

LABOR'S FEEBLE VOICE.
It is a Fingular fact that there are
fewer representatives of the wage
earnlnsr class in the British Parliament
than in '.be Parliament cf any con
tinental nation where Popular suffrage
exfsts. All told there are not more
than ten of them, while in the German
Reichstag- therr are something like
eighty. "The paucity of their number
cannot be attributed to their lack of
ability. They have all of them far
more brains than the average member
cf Parliament, and none of them is a
demagogue. There are something like
two score scions of the peerage in Par
liament, but ff the best of them were
picked out for the purpose it is doubt
ful if they could furnish a. team of
equal number-, that judged by any
standard of practical capacity would
pass muster with such men as John
Burns, Henry Broadhurst. Thomas
Burt, Will Crooks and the rest of the
doughty little band who hold briefs for
labor in the House of Commons.
Lords figure in every Cabinet, but
never a labor representative. An un
dersecretaryship is the highest official
honor ever bestowed on them, and only"
two of them have ever attained to that
dignityâ Broadhurst and Burt. Young:
Lord Tumour will stand an infinitely
better chance of receiving a Parlia
mentary office than Tom Richards.
Aristocratic influence counts for as
much inside the House as outside of it,
especially under the Cecil regime.
POSITION AS A LUXURY.
The fact that members of Parliament
are unpaW is alone sufficient to place
extremely narrow restrictions on labor
representation, or the election of poor
men. however able. ' When â¢ labor or
ganizations succeed in getting one of
their number elected to Parliament
they have to. subscribe money enough
to enable him to live while performing
his legislative duties. Of course there
are methods by which a member may
recoup himself for the lack of salary.
The most common and popular is the
acceptance of directorships in various
joint stock companifs in which the
magic letters "M. P." carry great
weight with the share-subscribing pub
lic and are liberally paia for.
Many aristocratic names appear
among these "guinea pig" directors, as
they are termed, but no iabor member,
despite the temptations of his poverty,
has ever besmirched his honor by such
associations. Xor has this been due to
any lack of opportunity. More than
once John Burns has been offered $2500
a year to allow his name to be used as
a director of some company dealing In
commodities that sell largely among
the working classes.
Laws against corruption are very
Ftringent, but for all tnat ihe "sack"
counts for quite as much in politics
here as in America, though in a some
what different fashion.
. -MAINLY FOR THE RICH.
The "finest club in the jvorld," as
the House of Commons has been
termed, is essentially a rich man's club.
There are far more wealthy men in it
than in Congress, and with many of
them â one might say with most of
them â it is to their wealth they owe
their election. They make themselves
"t-olid" with their constituencies by
spending: money freely in local char
ities, social organizations and football
and cricket club?.
Not long ago a member of Parliament
resigned because he frankly acknowl
edged he could no longer stand the ex
pense it entailed. There are over a
hundred members of the House of
Commons who figure in the Parliamen
tary directory as "country gentlemen."
which is an extremely large representa
tion for a very limited class. Most of
them have never earned their own liv
ings; "have no knowledge of business,
and would probably cut sorry figures
if suddenly turned adrift in the world
and thrown on tneir own resources.
Radicals predict that before many
years elapse members of Parliament
will be paid, and that with freer oppor
tunities given tb ability brainier men
will be elected, and rank and social in
fluence will not count for near as much
as they do now. It may be so, but the
signs of such a change are not ap
parent. The fact is that there is a
great amount of snob-worship among
the middle classes, and servility among
the lower, and while they exist the
way will he made easy for the lord and
the snuire to get into Parliament with
or without brains.
AMERICAN PEEK WILL SOOX
* RETURN TO THIS COUNTRY
L.ord Fairfax Finds the Simplicity of
the Western World More, to
His Liking. '
LONDON, Dec. 24.â Lord Fairfax,
the representative of that Maryland
family which has long held a Scotch
peerage, is looking forward with pleas
ant anticipations to his speedy re
turn to the land of his birth, where
he will be able to assume once more
the simple dignity of a plain American
citizen who recognizes to the full his
obligations to make a living himself.
His business mission, in connection
with some American banking institu
tion, has been far from successful. The
fault was probably none of his, for
money is scarce in these days and
British capitalists are very shy of mak
ing foreign Investments. Apparently
those who sent him here thought that
his title would attract people to the
scheme he represented. If anything
it has had quite the contrary effect. So
many scandals have resulted of late
years between the association of coro
nets and commercial ventures that
the public generally refuses to% bite at
the company promoter's hook when it
is baited with a peerage.
For his title Lord Fairfax really
eeems to care not a jot. He has so long
lived in America as plain Albert Kirby
Fairfax that he has no notion how to
assume the airs that are here supposed
to be the appropriate and necessary
accompaniment of it. He prefers
"Mr." to "My Lord," but people have
insisted on giving him the full benefit
of his title. At the swell functions,
which he found it. impossible to shirk,
he always looked bored and much out
of his natural element among those
with whom fashionable frivolity con
stituted the chief business of life.
A cynical critic remarked that it is a
great pity Lord Fairfax cannot take
back with him a shipload of youn?
titled idlers that in America they might
undergo transformation into useful
wage-earners like himself. Lord Fair
fax's visits to EnglaiKi seem associated
with failures. /
â  When all the peers of the realm were
being rounded up to grace, the corona
tion of King Edward VII he crossed the
Atlantic and had a costly set of peer's
robes made for him. but the King's ill
ness and the consequent postponement
of the coronation compelled his return
to America before he had had an'op
portunity to make a public appearance
in them. ,

HEIR TO VAST
IRISH ESTATE
Big Celebration Held Upon
Coming of Age of the Son
of the Earl of Kilmorey
WORTHY OF FORTUNE
iscoimt ISewry Said to Be
Favored With Good Looks
and a Strong Character
LONDON, Dec. 24.â In every way^a
lucky youth, and one who seems >to
deserve his good fortune, is Viscount
Newry, the eldest son of the Earl and
Countess of Kilmorey, whose coming of
age has just been celebrated with much
rejoicing and lavish hospitality at the
family seat, Mourne "Park, County
Down, Ireland, where the major por
tion of the broad ancestral acre,s are
situated. Tenants, friends and local
authorities have overwhelmed the
young heir and his parents with con
gratulations and gifts. The festivities
were kept up for a week, servants and
tenants sharing freely in the good time.
The Viscount's father is a fine, stal
wart, virile type of the aristocrat; his
mother is one of the stateliest, tallest
and handsomest women in the peerage,
and from them he has inherited a good
figure, a sound constitution, strength
and good looks, and brains enough to
steer clear of the pitfalls that beset
wealth and rank.
He is a lieutenant in the First Life
Guar.ds, the swellest regiment in the
British army, where many scions of
titled houses have first learned to "go
the pace." Young Lord Newry, has left
cards alone â takes his profession seri
ously, and is popular with his brother
officers. He gives himself no airs, and
is one of the unspoiled favorites of
society. '
Matrimonially he is a good catch, for
some day he will inherit 44,000 acres in
Ireland. 2000 in En'gland and a town
residence in addition to the Irish man
sion. The report circulated some time
ago that he was engaged to Miss Lulu
Pfizer. a - daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Charles Pfizer of New York, appears
to have been unfounded. As the family
is not an impecunious one he is not
under the" necessity of hunting up an
American heiress, but that is no reason
why he should not wed an American
girl some day.
The Earl of Kilmorey is one of .'the
representative peers of Ireland, but he is
a Protestant and the family is of Eng
lish origin, springing from William de
Nedham, who was Lord of Staunton in
3102. Though a keen sportsman he is
also a man of scholarly accomplish
ments and an M. A. of Oxford. He
v.as a member of Parliament* for some
years before he succeeded to the family
heritage. What he most prides him
self on is the fact that he has never
had any trouble* with his tenant?,
which is a rare record for an, Irish
landlord. The Countess is equally pop
ular with the tenants and takes sin
active interest in the promotion of
peasant industries.

LONDON, Dec. 24.â Mrs. Spender-
Clay's influence over her husband is
commencing to assert itself.' already.
The captain's chief income is desired
from the town of Burton-on-Trent,
where he owns much land besides be
ing one of the principal shareholders
In. Bass' brewery, but there is no evi
dence that he has ever, taken much in
terest in the town or its people. The
condition of the poor during the hard
winters always aroused the sympathy
of Miss^ Pauline Astor. but her bene
factions were usually.confined to the
East End of London. â¢
Since her marriage she has been to
Burton-on-Trent for , the first time,
and was shown over the huge brewery
by Lord Burton. She afterward, visit
ed some of the poorer districts of the
town where she witnessed squalgr quite
equal to anythingshe had seen in the
worst parts {of London. One or two
cases that needed immediate relief she
assisted there, and then with her own
hands.
Since that visit parcels, of clothing
and tickets for groceries and coal have
been distributed among a of
poor widows whose husbands have died
In the. service of the brewery. Cap
tain Spender-Clay has been seen more
frequently in the district since his mar
riage and he. too, now shows a decided
interest in charitable societies and or
ganizations throughout the town. It is
feared among clergymen and others
who are interested in the London poor
that Burton-pri-Trent's gain will be
London's loss. â¢
LKAVKS HANDSOME HOME.
When A. D. Loney of New "York ac- |
quired Willoughby Hall, in Northam-.
tonshlre. he thought that he found an
id*al residence! He* had previously
tried several places in Scotland and
England without discovering what he
really wanted. .. He has spent much
money on the new "residence in order to
render it equal to modern domestic re
quirements, and this week foundthat
the severity, of the English winter
would not permit him to spend Christ
mas there. He has removed his fam
ily to the south of France.'' and it is
somewhat doubtful whether they will
again return to Willoughby.
The sudden decision of Loney has
caused ihuch disappointment among. a
number of his friends because exten
sive preparations had been made to
have a 'fashionable party at the hall
for the Christmas festivities. A large
staff of servants has been disbanded;
but each member has been generously
treated, so that there will be no im
mediate necessity for them to swell the
ranks of the unemployed. %"."
Some of the local trades people feel
Loney's removal keenly because since
he has been in the neighborhood he
has made it a rule to support local
trade and industry as much as pos
sible. London stores were scarcely
drawn upon for anything, which is con
trary to the rule practiced by fashion
able people living in large country
mansions. Some persons living in the
neighborhood believe that Loney may
yn decide to keep the mansion as a

COLD ENGLISH HOUSES. .
This is the season when the much

English home proves a delusion and a
snare, and one yearns for the comfort
of the American stove or steam radia

Only the most' modern and preten
tious of English houses make any provi
sion for heating the whole house. To
one who is rioTTramiliarAvith the simi
larity of English habits to the laws of
the Medes and Persians, this national
adherence to archaic methods would
appear amazing. The annual waste of
fuel in England is something prodigi-_

.\N ODD LONDON CLUB.
There are many queer clubs in Lon
don, but probably the oddest is that
which dined the other night at the
Whitehall rooms. "Nobody's Friends" is
a quaint title, a phrase nardly sugges
tive of cxclusiveness and distinction.
Yet it includes among its members Ar
thur Balfour, Prime Minister; the two
Primates of Englandâ the Archbishop
of ' Canterbury and the Archbishop of
York â half a dozen bishops, tha Lord
Chief Justice and five or six lesser Jus
tices, beside various other notables.
Its name does not remotely suggest
its origin or. purpose. In the last quar
ter of the eighteenth century there
flourished one William Stevens, who at
tained fortune as a hosier and fame as
a theologian by the publication of an
essay in defense of those pillars of the
English church, the thirty-nine articles.
In lsOO.he issued a theological brochure
signed "Ain," which is Hebrew for "no
body," and Nobody's Club was
founded to commemorate its versatile
author. â¢' -â ' :
Except among antiquarians Stevens
and his works have long been forgotten
and undoubtedly the club would many
years ago have shared the same fate
but for one of its articles or incorpora
tion, by which its members pledged
themselves to dine together thrice a
year.; That bond of union has kept it
alive for. 104^ years and may continue it
In existence for another century or
two.

YANKEES PREY
OF GRAFTERS
American Sharpers in Lon
don Lie in Wait There for
Their Fellow Countrymen
WORK VARIOUS SCHEMES
Generally Seek to Secure
Loan by Telling a Well
Learned Hard Luck Story
LONDON, Dec. 24. â Probably few of
the people from the United States,
who have visited London this season,
have escaped a meeting with one or
more of the little clique of American
"grafters" here, who make fellow
countrymen their victims. Those of
them, who, by frequent encounters
have become well known to Americans,
are wearing- a prosperous air, from
which one would conclude that the sea
son-has been well spent.
One of the cleverest of these men ia
a dark-complexioned, quiet-voiced
young American of medium height and
poor but respectable appearance who
stops travelers anywhere between
Fleet street and Hyde Park corner to
tell them how, by becoming stranded
somewhere in the provinces, a theatri
cal troupe left him with barely enough
money to reach London. He makes his
distress so real that the tourist's hand
goes down into his pocket in almost
every case. On Sundays when there
are few Americans about the streets,
this individual haunts the British Mu
seum, the picture galleries and any
free exhibitions that may be open.
Another of thÂ«se "grafters" is bare
ly five feet two in height, solidly built
and invariably wears a broad-brimmed
soft hat. For two years he has "just
been discharged from Buffalo Bill's
show-" and he has an excellent story
about waiting for money from home
for which he has written.
Of American "confidence men" there
are many in London, especially during
th^ summer and autumn when visitor
are plenty. Their usual method is to
follow a traveler about until he "signs"
for a registered Jetter. or money order
at a no3tofficp. when, his name and
poFSibly his city ascertained hy look
ing over his shoulder, he is accosted,
"glad-handed" and frequently "done."
Americans who would be vary enough
at home seem to be off their guard
while on their travels and scraping ac
quaintances with them is a compara
tively easy matter.
A particularly successful member of
the gang of American grafters In Lon
don is a respectable looking fellow with
iron-gray hair and a business-like man
ner, who is supposed to get acquainted
with travejers' names from the hotel
registers and then make deductions as
to where, they have been from the la
bels on their baggage. This sharper
has been known to the metropolitan
police for six or seven years, but so
seldom \s the victim morally brave
enough to complain to the authori
ties that the latter have not been able
to take care of him.

Try to Save Companions
BAKERSFIELD, Dec. 24.â Two men
went down to their deaths in a tank
car at Sunset last evening and tha
lives of two others were imperiled by
their heroism in seeking to rescue their
companions from the deadly fumes of
gas in the emuty car. C. E. Barnea
and Ed Hoagland are tha victims who
died under the influence of the nox
ious vapors, while George Rogers and
?. Isenhurg nearly suffered a like fat
in their heroic efforts to brins their
companions to safety.
Work was begun in cleaning: out a
car that had been filled with distillate
standing at the terminus of tha Sun
set line, and Hoagland in a moment
was overcome by the Imprisoned va
uors. Foreman Barnes, on hearing- the
tall for help from others on the car,
rushed to the scene and without a mo
ment's hesitation dropped into tha
tank and attempted to rescua Hoag
land. ' He, too, was in a moment lying
senseless. George Rogers essayed to
effect their release. He descended Into
the car and vainly endeavored to bring
out Barnes. The gas was too much
for him, and he barely succeeded in
ascending the ladder into the fresh
air. Isenburg, another workman, with
out reckoning the danger to his own
life, dropped into the deadly fumes and
made a heroic effort to rescue his fel
lows. ITe was forced out of the tank,
but had no sooner filled his lungs wltb
fresh air than he attempted to return
to the work. He was forcibly detained
by other employes. In the meantimÂ«
ropes had been secured, and after much
effort the bodies of Barnes and Hoag
land v\ere brought to the top of the
car.
Barnes had been a resident of Los
Angelos, and with him in the oil fields
were hi.- wife and two children.
Hoagland was a resident of Ottumwa.
Iowa, and was a newcomer to thia
county. He was a Knight Templar.
TROUBLE IN SETTLING
COYOTE SCALP CLAIMS
Controller*** Office DIscoTers That the
Courts in Some Instances Have
Given Double Judgment*.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 24.â Th*
State Controller's office has run up
against a snag in connection with the
settlement of coyote scalp claims.
Four years ago there were claim3
against the State aggregating many
thousands of dollars for bounty on
coyote scalps. The Legislature appro
priated $204,000 to pay the claims.
The act made the money available on
the first of January, 1905. Deputy
State Controller W. W. Douglas said
to-day that there should be an ab
stract fcr the guidance of the Con
troller, which will show every certif
icate thnt has been sued on. It has
been found, 5ald Dougla?, that the
courts have given double judgment",
which meant that claimants could col
lect twice and thus secure many thou
sands of dollars from the State to
which they are not entitled.

THE BIRTHDAY.
TO-DAY the Christian world does not make holiday alone. It
accommodated its great holiday to an observance long before
born in the instinct and knowledge of man, which selected the
winter solstice as the birth of a new solar year, the end of the
lengthening night and beginning of the lengthening day. It was
human and natural in the early Christians to idealize the physical
fact of the solstice by associating with it an event which meant, in a
spiritual sense, the end of the dark days of the race and the birth of
a brighter future.
If all they idealized has not been realized by Christendom it is
not their fault. They gave to the world its highest ideal, and while
raanhas fallen far short of that model still the result has been and
continues to be uplifting. It is not beyond the range of a secular
paper to express the impression that man everywhere is better than
his fame and at heart is better than he seems. The evidence of this
is not confined to those who follow the Christian ideal, for there arc
other high motives which affect for the better the conduct of men,
but they all "converge upon practically the same center of a spiritual
purpose.
The English expedition into the land of mystery in high Tibet
promises to disclose much of the greatest interest concerning that
center of Buddhism and the effect of that philosophy upon the Asia
tic mind. The Buddhistic scriptures, which teach much that is
found in their Christian analogue, have profoundly affected the lives
of millions who have found in them the needed ideal. It was found
at Tibet that the Kah-gyur, or bible of the Buddhists, has expanded
to 108 volumes of iooo pages each, and that 225 volumes of com
mentaries upon these voluminous scriptures have been printed. Each
book of this bible weighs ten pounds and the whole requires a dozen
yaks for its transportation. Now. in illustration of the aspiration of
man for higher guidance, it is told in Tibet that a. tribe of Mongols,
living on the semi-deserts of high Asia, moved upon by the spiritual
instinct which has been one of the means of promoting civilization,
paid for a copy of this bible 7000 oxen and transported the book to
their country on a caravan of yaks. It became their guide and af
forded the ideal which they sought. 1 They studied as devoutly, the
birth of the Buddha as Christians do the coming of Jesus, and be
tween them and Christendom is the common spiritual tie and aspira
tion that binds the race together in one purpose â right living and the
practice of the common virtues.
; So the Christian world at this greatest of its feasts will honor
its ideals most by respecting their kinship to the ideals of men who
hold to other forms of expressing the spiritual need that joins all
men together. The nomadic Mongols, who traded their substance
for a sacred book, instead of being looked upon as dupes of supersti
tion are to be respected because they sought something better than
they had, and above all that having found it they lived up to it.
At this Christmas season there be those in the Christian world
who make lamentation because they say people are falling
away from religion. The philosophers do not sympathize with this
view. Man never falls away from religion. As well talk about the
annihilation of matter or of force as say that man separates himself
from religion, which is no less than his own conception of his place
in the universe of which he is a part. Men fall away from theology
and are none the worse for it. The venerable Dr. Lyman Abbott has
said recently that he has outgrown belief in teleology, a final cause,
and has abandoned faith in an anthropomorphic deity. But Dr. Ab
bott has found a larger and a greater God than he found in teleology
and in personal form. His conception of his place in the universe has
been enlarged and instead of being less reverent than before he is
more devout. ;â¢
At all the altars of Christendom to-day there is high ascription
to Jesus, and at some there may be denunciation of Dr. Abbott. But
this will be inconsistent. Jesus fell away from the theology of his
time. He found the deity of Judea a tribal God, invested with all
human attributes â a personality in which all the vices and all the
virtues of men were alike magnified. He taught briefly, with his own
hand he wrote no message and inscribed no- word, but he left to the
world in place of the tribal God of his fathers one that considered all
men as his children, the objects of his care, the beneficiaries of his
justice and affection. Religion was in the world before Jesus and be
fore Abraham, and each left it larger and better than he found it.
The thinkers who hold with Dr. Abbott are acknowledging onlv
the larger religion and see in the Father's house more mansions and
more places prepared than were seen of other men and in other
times. The Christian thought cannot be too large and as it expands
men will see its confluence with the great good that is in still more
ancient forms of the religious idea. . It is a wholesome thought and
full of comfort that this good race of man was not left lightless and
guideless in a world where it has no choice of entrance or of exit, to
be as insects gendering in the sun for millions of years until less, than
2000 years ago the creator of them all awoke to his duty and' set
among them a light. "As a father pitieth his children" is the right
idea, and what father would leave his child to perish for need of a
guiding hand and a light for its path?
In all ages there have been witnesses, and the immanence of the
principle of kindness and fatherhood may be seen in the adaptation of
the witness to the race and character of men till every kindred, every
tongue, hath its light and leading. Let us exalt ours'as the brightest
and the best, but not smite our brother man for doing the same, for
that way lies the blessing and benefit of. the light which shines for
all. This day is given over to doing honor to the teacher who taught
the universal fatherhood and universal brotherhood. In reverence
let us accept this great teaching and 'remember our brother man
everywhere. i- - v .<* .
CHRISTMAS IN CALIFORNIA.
CHRISTMAS in California is sblike and yet so unlike Christ
mas throughout the world. External conditions have, after
all, but little power to change the human heart iu*its divine
capacity for love, for service and for hope, and so to-day>the world is
girdled with thought forces which are more tender and more compas
sionate than at any other time, vibrant forces of good will which reck
nothing of frontiers and which pass duty free through the portals of
all nations and of all peoples. Surely such seasons as this leave be
hind them an afterglow upon the dark sky of human discords, and if
throughout Christendom a myriad voices break in upon the harsh
hates of men by acclaiming a peace upon earth where so little peace
seems to be this surely is not a mockery' if it but carry that underly
ing hope which sustains and which creates, compelling even the
wrath of men to serve it.
, If external conditions do not essentially change the human heart
they may give to its delights something of an. added. intensity, and
this perhaps constitutes the difference between Christmas in Cali
fornia and the same season elsewhere. Here in California. nature,
forgets her rigors.and her touch is so rarely a frigid one. Her dress
Is always made glorious with flowers and her bountiful busy hands
never weary in their beneficence. " â¢
To the wisdom of Shakespeare there came no prophetic glimpse
of California or he would perhaps not have written: - <
At Christmas I no more desire a rose .
Than wish a snow In May's new-fangled mirth;
But like of each thing that In season grows.
At Christmas time in California we 'may have roses to our
heart's content, and many another gracious gift Qffset by sunshine
and warm airs, for here the seasons do but mark the change of na
ture's prodigality but nev>ej" its cessation:
Christmas is above all else the period of good will,. for in what
better way can men keep vivid in their minds the. sacred benediction
of the day. If then the sons and daughters of the West could "as a
unit send a message of blessing to all the world what should that
message be? What better thing could California's children wish uri-

CHRISTMAS GREENS
L . /^HRISTMAS without greens!
*â¢/ Impossible! There surely
% must, be some of a sort in
this big farming world," Le
ona said almost tragically.
Her cousin and host, Amos Baker,
shook his head.
"None nearer than Sinking Fork," he
said. "that's twelve miles offâ and the
chances against finding anything even
there. The hills are so low and the
valley hardly worth the name." ...
"You. must take me to the head wa
ters. I know I shall find what I want
there," Leona said imperiously. "Get
out the wagonette at once! No matter
if Christmas is ten days off, I know a
way to keep greens fresh."
"Wc-n'i you say please?" Amos asked
banteringly, as he went toward the
door. Leona ran after him with the
prettiest face of contrition.
"Of course I will, and 'thanky sir,'
and anything else in the world you
ask," she said, laying her hand on his
arm.
He smiled at her. "Suppose I should
ask you to say 'yes' to Norrie Gordon.
I've a great mind to do it. If Norrie is
my brother-in-law, he's worth a dozen
of that other fellow."
"H-m. You are sure there is another
fellow?" Leona queried saucily, but
with a pretty flush.
Amos looked supernaturally wise.
"There must be," he said. "Candy
three times a week, and flowers and
gimcracks till the carrier wishes rural
tree delivery had never been thought of
â those are signs I've never yet known
to fail."
"You should not peek â it's ungentle
manly â even in your private mail box,"
Leona said severely, pursing her lips.
Amos' shook his head at her. "You
shouldn't flirt," he said: "But to-day
I'm bound to give you a chance â Nor
rie will go with you on this fernchase,
because I'm bound; to go somewhere
else." â¢ J
"How nice! Norrie is never saucy."
Leona said, with a dimpling smile. It
made her so enchanting that "Norrie,
just then cc-ming through the door, lost
his heart over again, for at least the
twentieth time. The losing gave him a
fearful joy â he, too, had read and in
terpreted the signs of the post. But
as he climbed into the wagonette, and
sent the horses away at a slapping
pace, he put all thought of this tin-.
known rival from him, resolved to en
joy at least one blissful day, basking in
the sunshine of Leona's smiles.
Presently the way bent at almost a
right angle. Norrie reined in there,
and said, letting his free hand rest over
Leona's clasped ones: "The Fork ia
Just aheadâ but you'll find nothing
there. I knowâ I hunt around it every
fall. I wonder if you dare giÂ» .down in
the hills with me? There you can get
leads of things â green cedar, cross-
vine, ferns and big green briers with
leaves like wax. I know of a holly
bueh. too, and a clump of pines â "
"Why aren't you taking me. . to
them?" Leona interrupted, her eyes
dancing.
Norrie smiled back at her, but there
was an anxious under-note in his voice,
as he answered: "Because they're a
long way offâ not too far for the horses
â but so far we'd be in the night get
ting home."
"As if that mattered!" Leona said
scornfully: "When you know my heart
is set on giving those dear babies such
a Christmas as they never saw.' Your
sister Amy says I may do just what I
please â I' please to have aÂ» Christmas
tree, with the whole house trimmed to
match. Drive on â like the wind â San
cho and Sally will have a long rest,
while you are helping me hack and
hew." -iiV"--j/!'
"Just as you say, ma'am," Norrie an
swered suspiciously meek: "But if I
haul the tree home, to say nothing of
cutting it down, I'm to have my choice
of whatever is on.lt, or under it. Is
that a bargain?" .. . > , .
"It has to be â but I never thought
you'd be such an extortioner," Leona
said loftily, although her eyes twinkled.
to their kin than that they too might share her prosperous peace,
that with her blessings they also might be blessed, crovvning / them
selves with laurels of success and walking the world's ways in the
gladdening sunshine of the heart.
And what can California desire fot herself, already loaded down
with gifts from field and orchard, richest spoil from vineyard and
from mine? Nature has for her no gift of beauty unbestowed, no
hoarded wealth unoffered, and for her no door is closed that leads to
peace and power. Let her then ask that even as she has received so
may she give, and if the California Christmas time brings with it
tenderness and love, and kindly thought, 'and will to help and serve,
so may she be assuredthat by these things all times are blessed, not
one alone, if she but keep within her heart, treasuring it there, some
of the* comradeship, of Christmas day in California.

Then she fell silent, drinking in the joy
of the sunshine, of the rapid whirl
through the soft December day."
The landscape grew more - barren,
more broken, the flelas were 'smaller,
the farmhouses meaner, and less
thrifty. By and by the road ran down
a steep ridge, only to climb an oppo
site one steeper still. The sun had be
gun to sinkâ Norrie looked up at It,
apprehensively, then sent the blacks
faster, a mile farther on he stopped,
and sprang out, saying as he lifted Le
ona to her feet: "You'll want your sup
per before you get it I reckonâ but here
we are."
Leona cried out in raptures./ .Before
her stood a clump of pines. On beyond
down the rocky slope, lay matted arm
fuls of long, lacy fronds. The green
briers also were in evidence! She caught
up Amos' pruning sheers and began
to cut things right and left. She was
so intent that she did not see' Norrie
slip away. But very shortly she looked
up to see him dragging in a fine young
holly full of .scarlet berries. "The kids
never saw anything like it," he said, as
he hoisted it into the wagonette, and
made it fast : there. Then he fell to

and tearing down mats of brier. Leona
looked at him with someinlngiof awe â
he was so slight, and light on his feet,
she had never credited him with the
thews, and sinews of manhood. Insen
sibly she contrasted him with the other
fellowâ the city fellow, who could, and
would give her millionsâ millions which
had almost tempted. her to accept the
man, albeit she knew she did not love
him truly. If she had asked him to set
his hand to hard things for her pleas
ure, she, could fancy his look of amazed
diSgUSt. :"-:\ .
Still she could not Tvhl6tle film down
the wind. She was proudi ambitious,
luxury-loving^ not the least bit suited
to be a farmer's wife. And^Norrie Gor
don loved his land, and his vocation too
well ever to be anything but a farmer.
With a sigh she told herself she should
â¢no doubt end by taking Ennis. Loring.
Suppose he should accept her casual
invitation, and come down to Longly,
the Baker place, for the holidays? How
bare and cramped the life would appear
to him â a life wherein the, circus made
the event of the year, and -going to
church of Sundays was as much a di
version as a duty.
Something: of all this floated nebul
ously through Leona's rnind as she
watched Norrie at his joyous obedience.
"The best branches are over on that
far side," he said, flinging off his coat,
and scuffling out of his shoes: "We'll
take Just half a dozenâ the tree won't
miss 'em. I'd hate to leave It raggedâ
somehow this clump seems to belong to
meâ I found it first when I was little
more than a boy."
Almost before she knew It. he stood
among the branches, breaking and cut
ting slender stems. Leona ran to pick
them up as they fell. "Stand back,"
he called to her, at the .same time
reaching for an especially tempting
bough. The wood of it was toughâ it
bent where he thought to break it, and
instead of snapping it crushed into
stringy fibers. Norrie had the Impulse
of mastery even over inanimate things.
Forgetful that he was twenty-flve feet
In the air, he gave the bough a jerk so
energetic it made him lose his balance,
and come crashing earthward. But
there were boughs lower downâ and
somehow he clutched one with his right
arm, swung himself up to it, and
clambered back to the trunk. Coming
down this, Leona'saw him hitch him
self along in a way wholly unlike his
ascent. She did not know the reason,
until he stood by the wagonette, say
ing almost apologetically: "I reckon
you'd better drive, on the way home â
my left arm hit that big limb when I
fell, and put itself out of business."
Longly farm at Christmas-tide made
the neighbors stare. Amy had insist
ed upon a party â it would never, never
do to waste all Leona' had" brought to
pass simply upon the family. Greens
were everywhere â over doors and win
dows, in nooks and corners, and up and
down the broad stairway. The tree,
too, was a vision â with tapers gleam
ing thrc-ugh its coral wealth, and all
manner of tinsel ornaments sparkling
amid its green leafage. The tinsel had
come from the city. So had the other
fellow.
, Leona had been panic sticken at the
outtet â now a sunny peace possessed
her spirit. TSince she had seen Norrie
topplin* against the evening skyâfall
ing it might be to his death, for his
lady's whim, she had begun to question
her own heart more closely than ever
before. What answer had rewarded
the questionings she did not tell. But
Ennis Loring had found her more soft
ly, more subtly fascinating than ever,
and was ready for her sake to keep
terms with all the rural world. It
amused him of course that the tree
bore such wondrous fruitage. Trees
were not Christmas commonplaces
"round about Longly. So all the people
"round about had sent their gifts to be
piled at the tree's foot, and thence dis
tributed. After* they were distributed,
there would be supper, then the dance.
Norrie would have to be a looker-on.
His broken arm was not yet out of the
sling.
Amos ought to have been Santa
Claus, but had flatly refused. So Leona
herself, made up into a startling
Christmas fairy, with a black half
mask, andra pair of realistic wings, ap
portioned properly the Christmas tree's
fruit, saying things that fitted most
cases beautifully, and so doubled the
value of the presents. Nobody had
been forgotten â Ennis Loring stood
hugging a huge tin horn â Norrie's
sound arm , was fairly heaped with
bulging parcels, topped with a toy au
tomobile. Then the fairy lifted from
the. litter of moss and greenery-at the
tree's foot a huge pair of spectacles
and clapped them upon her own eyes.
"I am looking for â the person I belong
to," she said clearly. Everybody held
breath as she walked up to her two lov
ers who by some chance stood side by
side. For a breath she studied their
faces intently, a beautiful flush showing
below her half-niask, then with a lit
tle laughing cry she laid her hand upon
Norrie"s, saying very low: "This is
what you get for finding me these
Christmas greens."â Copyright, 1904, by

LOVE IS A MUCH STRONGER
INFLUENCE IN THE LIVES OF
MOST WOMEN THA N AMBITION
BY DOROT HY FENIMORE.
HAVE you ever counted up how
many things there are that a
woman cannot afford to do?
Their names are legion. Their
-sum includes matters of conduct and
matters of conscience. But, for daily
reference, almost all of them can be
translated to the best advantage into
terms of the affections. For love is a
greater Influence In the lives of most
women than ambition, or convention,
or even duty. If we are to live wisely,
then, we creatures of destiny, whose
horizon is narrowed to a pin-point, we
must love wisely. Love, whether pro
pitious or baneful, is our guiding star.
The common tendency among women
in this spendthrift age is to live be
yond their means emotionally. To feel
and to express, to enjoy, if not act
ually, at least vicariously through lit
erature and the imagination, pleasures
which are beyond the common lot, are
the motives which cause and which
feed the passion for excitement which
is coming to be known as the great
American vice. Our women are as
prone to emotional excess as our men
are to mental excess. To observers
abroad this lack of personal balance
appears to be the distinctive American
characteristic.

QUEER MARRIAGE TANGLE
Mile. L., about to ,be married, has
discovered, on taking steps to publish
the banns, that she is married already,
says the Paris correspondent of the
London News. It must be so, as it is
3et down in black and white on the
Town Clerk's register. Her elder sister,
at the same time, made an equally
startling discovery. Though she had
imagined herself to be the wife of the
man to whom she thought she wa3
wedded some years ago, and by whom
she has several children, she now finds
that, far from being married to him,
she is her supposed husband's sister
in-law, as he is legally united to her
sister. How the unfortunate family and
the careless Register will worry out
this inextricable situation is not known.
The elder sister could be married again,
this time in due form, to her husband,
but the younger sister must previously
be unmarried, and how is that to be
done? It is well known that heaven
and earth have to be moved before an
error on a register can be corrected, as
In the example of a child to whom a
wrong name has been given, which can
never afterward be altered. The family
of Mademoiselle, or, rather Mme. L.,
are seriously thinking that, instead of
attempting to prove that she Is not
her sister, and vice versa, it will be
simpler for her to divorce her brother
in-law, 1 after which the latter will re
marry his wife, who is now legally his
sister-in-law, while .Mademoiselle â¢will
take unto herself a 1 second husband,
without having ever been married be

wright in the family to turn the lat

In the United States from the books of
some American women who are notable
in their own country as examples of
misguided and ill- balanced womanhood,
has recently gone into hysterics over"
the American woman's profanation of
luve's altar. It seems that she has
tipped It over. And, like a naughty,
willful child, she does not care a bit.
She has aimed the first great blow at
the reign of love; she stands self-con
fessed as cold of heart and cool of
head; she is proverbially untrue to the
male of her race; she rides over man
roughshod; she Is demoralizing to her
sex, exclaims this poor, excited, literary
man, in a frenzy of rhetoric.
Now, really, H. B. Marriot-Wat3on.
It's not so bad as that. American wo
men are by superior charm and busi

market for their English sisters. But
here at home they might be colder of
heart and cooler of head without hurt-

that they seem to have been created
only to love and to be loved. When
they love, they love once and forever,
and usually they prefer to love un
happily.
This is certainly not an American
type. But we have a type as silly and
as exasperating â that of women who
have, through sentimentality, lost ap
preciation of genuine sentiment and
who never see the simple pleasures of
life growing naturally along their wo
man's pathway.

THE ADVANTAGES OF THE CENTRALIZED SCHOOL
r â  HERE are tremendous possi

. *â¢ past there has been but
little rhange in their general
condition. It is true that the qualifica
tions' required of the teacher** are
higher than formerly, that there is
closer sympathy and co-operation in
thÂ» teaching profession and that in
pome parts of the State, more liberal
views in the community have brought
ampler equipment and better school
houses.
Nevertheless adjustment to modern
conditions haÂ« not been made, for the
Lv^ragre school district remains as it
â  was nearly a generation ago. The old

that the schoo'.house must b<? near the

institution where two human beings are
drawn together by love. Union and
happiness are the result. Such mar
riages are divine. Marriages to-day in
most cases arc merely an outward tie,
impelled by custom, policy, necessity,
founded not even in friendship, to say
nothing of love. A true wife acknowl
edges her husband's authority, but ehe
must realize that she is at the head of
the house, but not the boss. May the
good Lord deliver us from a boss in
petticoats. If some women would put
the same energy in their housework as
they do in gossip many saloons 'and
beer clubs would have to close their
doors, and husbands would remain at
home with their wives.
"An ideal wife lives within her hus
band's Income. Many a poor husband
is strangled by his wife's fine lace. I
pity a man who efter marrying finds
that all he has to show for his mar
riage fee is a dress form, a medicine

ifornia. This is to come through the
establishment of what te sometimes
called the centralized school. Its nu
merous benefits are to be secured by
disorganizing several adjoining school
districts, consolidating them into a
union district graded school and daily
transporting all. of the children bj\
hired carriages to and from their
homes.
There are two distinct purposes in
view for this Dlan. One of these is for
a financial and the other for an educa
tional reason. Taking up first the edu
cational feature as the most important
one to be considered, it may be seen that
that the plan contemplates the organ
ization of a strong union school to be
held in a three or four room schooihouse
built in a central locality in accordance
with modern ideas of ventilation, sani
tation, light and heat. The old school
buildings can be sold or kept for neigh
borhood convenience. Fewer teachers
will be wanted, but superior ones; will
be required and their services will be
more permanent Each teacher will
teach two or three grades only, with
far better results than when caring for
eight or nine grades. Of course, one of
the teachers will be the supervising
principal. In such a school special
studies of music, drawing and, nature
work can often be thoroughly taught.
There will be more professional enthu
siasm among the teachers, with the sure
result that school becomes. much more

"How should a man treat his wife?"
"A good husband is one who thinks
more of his wife than he does of him*
self. Hareh and cruel words often
make / bad cooking. It drives all the
wife's energy away. . A good husband
will not spend $6 of his wage before he
gives his wife $1 toward the family's
support. He will not give her six un
kind words before he gives her one kind
one. He will not stay out six nights a
week and remain home but. one night
a week with his wife. He will not pay
for half a dozen meats in another fam
ily before he provides for one in his

More public interest Is manifested in
the larger school and better men are

tures and entertainments can . be sus
tained. In short, the centralized school
can be made the intellectual and social
center of the whole territory that it
reaches. Through such a school chil
dren no longer receive the smaller-bene
fits of the isolated school, but obtain all
that belongs to the thoroughly organ
ized, well disciplined and amply equip
ped town school. The advantages of
country life and town life are in this
manner combined.
Besides the<Â£e signal educational im
provements, the centralized school fur
nishes its superior advantages, includ
ing transportation charges, for'a less
outlay than is required by the employ
ment of a larger number of teachers in
four, five or more districts and the in
evitable annual repairs on all the sepa
rate, school buildings. This assertion
is demonstrated by experience and thus
the economic view merits most careful
attention. .
It will be readily seen that the-strik
ing features of this radical change is
the transportation of the children. * The

because the plan has * elsewhere been
successfully adopted for many "years.
It Is in line with that other popular
modern innovationâ rural mail delivery.
How is ' the transportation â ' managed ?
In one of three ways. By. taking; the
himself and not become careless and
negligent. .*
"My model husband does not wait un
til his wife dies to give her flowers. He
brings her a rose whenever he possibly
can while she is on the earth to enjoy it.
A single rose perfumed with love in
life is wortlvmore than a dozen wreaths
on the eaaket lid. A model husband
snould â¢ frequently place his arms
around his wife and tell her how sweet
and beautiful she is. It may be stretch
ing the truth, but God will forgive you
and your wife will be happy. He must
remember, 11 how blind he was to her
faults before marriage. If he has dis
covered her faults he must keep his
eyes closed tight and not say a word.
"A model husband always remembers
he is the husband of one wife. When
he thinks less of his wife and more of
another worapn the breakers of hell are
tefore him. A model husband should
always enter the home with a beaming
countenance, no matter how hard the
children from a central point, by the
carriage passing through the main
road only, or by the carriage calling at
all the homes in the neighborhood. The
third course' is the most convenient
and proves most successful of all. Cov
ered carriages are provided; equal care
with the selection of teachers is be
stowed in engaging drivers; routes are
let to the lowest approved bidder who
is uncler bonds and the conveyance is
made on schedule time. Tardiness at
school consequently disappears from
the list of school annoyances.
m What objections are urged â¢ against
the centralized school? A great many,
but it is noticeable that they are al
ways made before such a school'opens
and rarely afterward. It is sometimes
alleged by patrons in opposition that
walking to school is ' good exercise for
the children: that four or five miles
distance ,is^ too far to send the little
folks; that associations in the carriage
and at intermission at- school are not
always ' favorable; 'that property* will
depreciate, and, finally, that the pro
ject is impracticable" Replies are, made
that farm children . seldom â ; suffer, for
want of exercise; that a few miles dis
tance cannot be -hurtful .when a child
Is carried; drivers and teachers are.re
quired to be watchful in all these ar
rangements; and that the experience
in ' many States proves the almost un
qualified success of the plan. The ob
jection of depreciation of ; real estate is
not sustained as the facts are other
wipe. A school house confers no value
of itself, and a superior graded school
day's. work has been or how much
money he has lost. in stocks or business.
"If husbands forget all this the result
will be the home will â  be dreary, the
children's voices will be hushed and de
spondency and gloom will reign where
sunshine and happiness would predom
inate. A smile upon the noble woman
who has sacrificed her very life for him
will make his home an ideal one. It is
enough to make any honest, high
minded man desperate to think of the
treatment that too many wives receive
at the hands of their husbands. Their
husbands! It is a shame to apply to
these degenerates so noble a term. The
true husband guards his wife's peace
of mind and is zealous of the trust she
has reposed in him. But these men are
quite regardless of their wives' happi
ness. Business is first, home second,
or, I should say, last.
"This is a transitory age in which
many a husband treats his wife too
much as chattel property, yet, he does
Bix miles distant, with transportation
provided, brings . higher value to a
neighborhood than a weak district
school half a mile away.
The flippant remark of city residents
is occasionally heard to the effect that
they have no interest in what the coun
try schools are doing. No greater mis
take can be made, especially if -the in
different man is a taxpayer. At least
half of the best blood of the cities comes
from the- strong, resolute manhood of 1
the country. The cities have a deep,
vital concern in all that relates. to the
upbuilding and advancement of rural
educational interests.
It is now time to speak of the birth
of 'this* new idea. Long ago it passed
the age when it might be deemed a
bantling. In 1869 the State" of Mas
sachusetts enacted a Jaw which al
lowed the. local school committees to
expend money "in their -discretion, in
providing for the conveyance of pu
pils , to and from the, public schools."
The result has been that hundreds of
small, outlying schools in that State
have been closed and more than .2000
scholars are now daily carried. at pub
lic expense to and from centralized
schools.' Eighteen other States have
passed laws providing for the consoli
dation .of country, schools, these
eighteen containing nearly half the
population of, the United States. The
universal testimony from these States
is strongly ; in favor of centralization.
One. might as well ask a farmer in
those sections to vote for abandoning
rural mail 'delivery as to expect him
not give her a right to share In his
business and plans, does not allow her
the proper responsibility which belongs
to her.
"A husband must not treat his wife
as a dependent. Do not put her to the
humiliating inconvenience of asking
you every time she wants carfare. Tour
wife is not your child, whose spend
thrift tendencies you must curb. Con
sider together your income, the cost of
actual necessities, how much should be
placed In reserve and then divide the
rest between you.
"Dress your wife well, not extrava
gantly. When she comes down in a
ravishing creation of white chiffon and
pink La France roses don't tell her that
a half-dozen American Beauties at a
quarter the price would do just as well.
She will think of those you sent her the
morning of the wedding at $10 a dozen.
The saddest spectacle is that of a sweet,
sensible, intelligent woman married to
a conceited, empty-headed, tyrannical
fool.
to return to the old plan of sending
his children to a small, ungraded
school.
In March, 1903, an excellent permis
sive law took effect providing for the
union of school districts in California.
The way to organize for these union
district schools is to write to the State
Superintendent of Public Instruction at
Sacramento for a copy of this law and
to obtain his suggestions, secure, if
possible, the personal aid of others who
are familiar -with the subject, agitate
the matter unceasingly and in due
time circulate the necessary petition.
The hope for elementary education
of rural California lies in the central
ized school. G. G.

and . some recent observations of
Simeon Snell appear, to throw some
light on its causation, says the London
Hospital. Allowing that in certain in
stances astigmatism or other form of
ametropia is a factor , in its produc
tion, "he yet argues that there are
other influencing conditions. In sup
port of this he quotes the experience
of a lady who always suffered from
severe, headaches after visiting the
theater when she had occupied a seat
in pit. but -was free from such
a disturbance when she sat in the
dress circle. In the first position, it is
pointed out, sustained action of the
"When God had created Adam he
saw that what man desired more than
anything else was a helpmate. He
therefore created woman for man
namely. Eve. He didn't take part of
man's brain to create her. If such
would have been the case woman would
have been superior to man. God didn't
want that. Neither did he take a part
of man's feet to create her, for if such
would have been the case man would
have despised woman.' God didn't de
sire that. But we find that God took
from man a rib and from it created
woman. We all know that the ribs are
located close to the heart, and he did
that so that man should love woman.
"The question of boss-ship should
never be considered in the home. Both
should occupy the head chair of the
family together and discuss the needs
of the family, the topics of the day, etc.
Try to enlighten one another. Love
your wife, show her lots of pleasure
and your home will be an ideal one."
e.'evator muscles of the eyeballs is re
quired in order to see the stage, and
this ia exactly the action which is re
quired in studying a collection of pic
tures, and more especially in looking- at
those which are hung "above the
line." The same experience has been
noted by Mr. Snell in' the case of
cyclists, particularly of those who lean
over the handlebars with the head
lowered, and who therefore in lookin?
ahead keep the eyeballs upward. A
further argument is found in the ex
perience of miners* nystagmus, which
it is suggested is due to weariness of
tho elevator muscles of the eyeballs,
caused by the constrained position in
which the miner works. There can be
no doubt of the physiological fact that
lateral movement of the eyeballs is
much more easy and requires less
muscular effort than movement in a
vertical plane. All this goes to show
that muscular strain is sustained in
upward movement of the ey balls and
this may well result in a sense of
weariness or more pronounced discom

Supreme Court Holds Public Property
May Be Condemned Under Cer
tain Restrictive Conditions.
In a decision rendered yesterday
the Supreme Court grants corporations
"the right, under certain restrictive
conditions, to condemn public prop
erty for its own uses. It is specified
that the change must result in more
general good.
The Marin ' County Water Company
wanted a portion of the Bolinas road
condemned for the establishment of a
reservoir. The Supervisors objected
and the corporation brought suit. The
lower court held that the. road could
not be condemned, but the higher
ti ibunal reverses . that decision. '
The Supreme Court says the water
company can have the portion of the
road wanted if it can be proved that
the establishment of the reservoir will
be of more benefit to Marln County
than the use' of the property in ques
tion.

kou end Yahutfui upon our newly oc
cupied position, following this with a
determined counter attack, during
which hand grenades were thrown, but )
our forces firmly repulsed the enemy, j
I>ater. as the enemy's bombardment ]
abated, we constructed some defensive
â¢works, so that our occupation became
more assured. . I
"A* a result of our heavy gun bom- j
bardment before and during the attack, j
the fort of Taiyangkou was set on fire.
One fifteen-centimeter gun in each of
the forts was destroyed. The covers
were also considerably damaged.

"At 1 o'clock in the afternoon of

ST. PETERSBURG. Dec 24. â Gen
eral Kuropatkin reports having on De

sians forced an entry into Bentsia
putze. orcusied some of the intrench
ments and repulsed the counter at

TOGO REVIEWS HIS WORK.
Admiral Announces That 111? Task at
Port Arthur Is Finished.
TQKIO, Dec 24.â The navy depart
ment declines to discuss the forma
tion, movements or plans of the Japan
ese flying squadron, reported to be In
the vicinity of Singapore.
The advanced Japanese batteries at
Port Arthur have succeeded in reach
ing the Russian battleship Sevastopol.
One successful hit is reported. It is
expected that the battleship will soon
be completely destroyed.
Admiral Togo announces the with
drawal of the majority of the fleet
from Port Arthur. Telegraphing under
date of December 22. he says:
"After 203-Meter Hill was occupied
as the result of a gallant and desper
ate attack by the besieging army, the
bombardment of the enemy's squadron
with siege and other heavy guns be
came effective. In consequence, the
battleships Poltava and Retvizan were
eunk and subsequently the battleships
Pobieda and Peresviet, the protected
cruiser Pallada and the armored cruis
er Bayan were sunk.
"The battleship Sevastopol escaped
The San Francisco Call.
the land bombardment, left the harbor
on December 9 and was anchored near
Chentao Mountain. She was attacked
there continuously by our torpedo
boats and heavily damaged.
"The main strength of the enemy Is
completely crushed. Only a weak gun
boat, the Otyashni, and several torpedo
boat destroyers remain afloat. Under
the circumstances, our combined fleet
has been removed as unnecessary from
the blockade of Port Arthur, which
had been maintained since May L I
have arranged for a closer watch for
ships attempting to run the blockade
and to watch the remnant of the ene
my's squadron.
"During the blockade we suffered
from the enemy's mines, both laid and
floating, on the high seas, and from
dense fogs. The cruisers Miyako, Sal -
yen and Yoshino; the Hatsuse, battle
ship; the Kaimon, gunboat, and the
Heyen, coast defense vessel, were stink
and many gallant and loyal officers and
men were killed, but we succeeded In
maintaining the blockade. When the
enemy emerged from the harbor our
fleet successfully engaged him and
finally, with the valuable support of
the besieging army, eucceeded in
crushing nearly all the enemy's squad
ron. Our second, squadron bo heavily
damaged the Vladivostok squadron
that tt has since been_unable to leave
port-
"A!l the success is gratefully at
tributed to the brilliant virtue of our
Emperor.
"During the blockade all the ships
under my command splendidly accom
plished the jvork and duty assigned to
them. Especially to be noted are some
of those who are engaged In the diffi
cult and risky task of blockading or
who tirelessly accomplished the work of
laying mines in the presence of the
enemy, others who braved all dangers
were engaged In the work of clearing
mines away and others still who were
posted to watch the enemy and guard
against the enemy's ships. Their com
bined work strongly contributed to the
accomplishment of the blockade. I
deem it my duty to especially mention
my recognition of the valuable services
rendered by the officers and men."
COSSACKS OX LO.VG RIDE.
Daring .Raiders Approach to Within
Thirty Miles of Yinkow.

SIXMIXTING. Manchuria, Dec. 24.â
Colonel Plaoutine and a Cossack force
crossed the Liao River on December
21 to watch the Japanese movements
on the west bank of the rjver. Colonel
Plaoutine marched to within thirty
miles of Yinkow, making more than
200 versts in all. He came within sight
of the Japanese post on the west bank
of the Liao River and then turned
north-northwest, marching by night on
the Yinkow-Sinminting Railroad,
which is reported to be carrying con
tra-band of war, for the Japanese.
Colonel Plaoutine ascertained* that
2000 Chunchuses In Japanese pay have
gone north of Sinminting in order to
destroy the Russian railway.
This winter march has been very
picturesque and well conducted. The
cold was intense, but the Cossacks
seemed to like it. The Russian force
found all the Chinese villages on Its
line of march fortified with ditches and
moats.
RUSSIA'S NORTH* SEA DEFENSE.
Claims to nave Ample Proof of Pres
ence of Japanese Vessels.
PARIS, Dec. 24.â The Russian de
fense before the international com
mission which is to inquire into the
North Sea incident is practically com
pleted. The main features are:
Firstâ That the firing by the Rus
sian squadron was justified aa a de
fense -against attack. This entails
proving the presence of Japanese tor
pedo-boats. The Russian delegates
claim "they have this proof in most
positive and overwhelming form.
Second â That even if the Russians
were not attacked, â¢ they believed they
were attacked, and, therefore, the de
fensive measures taken were in abso
lute good faith.
Thirdâ That at most it .was an acci
dent at sea, where ~ the . dangers and
risks are extreme, and "was analogous
to the British battleship Camperdown
ramming and sinking -the British bat
tleship Victoria and the recent firing
by'a British warship upon.a coasting
vessel during target practice.

HEADQUARTERS OF THE JAPAN
ESE THIRD ARMY, BEFORE PORT
ARTHUR, Tuesday,' Dec. 20.â Since the
general assault of November 26 and 27,
against the forts on Rihlung and Kee
kwan mountains, resulting in furious
fighting and great loss of life, the Jap
anese have, been engaged in tunneling
under the north fort of Keekwan Moun
tain, two main tunnels were run under
the north wall of the fort from the
moat for a distance of forty feet and
there were four short branch tunnels.
On the morning of December 18 seven
dynamite mines were laid, the object of
which was to destroy the s north wall
and so give the Japanese access to the
fort. -"V-
The fort had so long resisted the as
saults of the Japanese that it was con
sidered necessary that the explosions
of the mines and the subsequent at
tacks should be carefully planned.
General Samejima, commanding the
left division, asked for volunteers who
would be prepared to capture the fort
or to die in the attempt. Two entire
battalions answered the general's call,
one from the left division and the other
from the general reserves. The first
battalion remained in the caponiere gal
leries during the explosion of the mines,
while the second battalion was In a
parallel close to the wall of the counter
scarp.
ALL-BROWN UNIFORMS.
In order that the dark blue uniforms
of the men might not show against
the brown of the soil whlcS" would be
turned by . the force - of the explosion,
all the attaokers wore brown woolen
undergarments over their trousers^and
brown "sweaters" over their tunics. In

COUNTY AID
Aged Man Tells Piti
ful Story of In
gratitude.
Â£ recial Dispatch to The Call
PORTLAND, Dec. 24.â Irvine Harris.
S2 years old, a taxpayer in Multnomah
County since 1 $63, scion - of a proud
Kentucky family, cultured and of fine
sensibilities, has gone to the poor farm
to. spend his few remaining days as a
charge on the county. He owned 160
acres of land at Orient, a small town In
Multnomah County, which he deeded to
his sons, William and Henry Clay
Harris, but now that he la old and 13 in
sore need he is denied, it is asserted,
the support he naturally expected. He
was counseled to permit the County
Court to bring the necessary action at
law to compel his children to care for
him. His reply was that he .preferred
to die in the streets rather than accept
any such aid, for the reason that his
sons*; wives were prejudiced- Sgfeinst
him and had made it impossible fuNiu*
sons to provide for him. jjffiJpSB
- "I have. only, a few. days left," said
the aged Kentuckian, "and I hope I am
violating no rule of legal propriety in
asking the county to care for me dur
ing the little time that remains."
Hi3 petition was granted, and Dud
ley Evans, In charge of the County
Board of Charities, gave him carfare to
pay his way to the poor farm.
V'l won't be much bother, I guess,"
said he to Evans, as he left the tetter's
office to go to the poor farm, "and the,
bother won't Jt>e for very long. But at
any rate, it will be a place of refuge
for me, and I will have something to
eat and a place to sleep, though I will
have to walk to the poor farm, as I
have not a cent of money in my pos
session." It was then that Evans gave
him carfare.

THB VALUE OF CHARCOAL.
Few Peoi.:^ Know How Useful It Is In
Preserving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature,
but few realize its value when taken
Into the human system for the same
cleansing purpose. ....
Charcoal is a remedy that the; more
you take of it the better;, it; is! not i
drug at all, but simply absorbs th4
eases and impurities always present
in the stomach and intestines and carl
ries them out of the system. â - Y f
Charcoal sweetens the -breath"' after
smoking, drinking or after eating on-
ions and other odorous vegetables."- â¢.-'
Charcoal effectually clean* and Im-
proves the complexion; it whitens the.
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic. â¢ - -
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists Bell charcoal In one
form or another, but probably the
best charcoal and the most. for the
money Is in Stuart's Charcoal Lozen-
ges; they are composed of the finest
powdered Willow charcoal and other
harmless antiseptics in tablet form,
or rather in the form of large, pleas-
ant tasting lozenges.: the charcoal be-
ing mixed with honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much Improved^condl-

make - the : " second assault. .' General
Samejima- personally conducted those
assaults at 2 o'clock on the, afternoon
of ; Pecember 19, . after the .explosions
had. taken place. . r ',\
The ; first mine exploded without
warning and the explosion was not en
tirely successful^ owing to the heavy
concrete above the mine. The explo
sion of the second mine followed im
mediately and this was succeeded by
five smaller explosions. . , . ::
The sight wonderful in the ex
treme. Huge clouds of brown earth
and debris of all kinds were thrown
200 feet into the air and.it looked as if
the whole fort had been sent heaven
ward. When the clouds of â¢ earth had
settled down, the snow for some BOO
yards around the fort was covered with
brown earth, .pieces of timber and
blocks of concrete. -. .. .
The -explosions made two. t large
breaches in the north wall of the fort,
through .which the . Japanese in the
moat swarmed. ;.They charged so
quickly that fifty of them were either
killed or wounded by the falling
debris. The . Japanese succeeded in
gaining the ramparts and charged- the
interior of the fort, but they were re
pulsed by apportion of the garrison
from behind a wall at ; the rear of the
fort, which had not been touched by
the force of the explosion. Behind this
wall there were four field guns and
three machine guns.
In the meantime, the. Russians had
rushed re-enforcements of some 300 to
the fort, through the covered wall at
the rear. ...
The Second battalion of attackers
was not- able "â¢' to advance immediately,
as the ; sapping trenches . from the
parallel to the. moat were -filled with
debris. "When this debris had been ex
cavated the. battalion, gained the moal
and/reached the ramparts through the
breaches â â  that had ;been made by. the
explosions. . â¢/ *
SCATTERS \HIS MEX.
'The' ; cpmmander''of ;tnis' enterprise
'realized that' any attempt to gain the
'Interior of "the- fort would : end in ; dis
aster if his v.'hole force advanced in one
body, so hie- disposed 7 his men along
the Wall arid ordered them t6 gain the
lower level of tne Interior of the fort by
twos "and. tfitees arid' to find cover in
the . holes' which"' had'beeft -made ' in' the'
surface by the*' Japanese' shells. -In the
Vwhole -. center \ dt - the | tort .; great holes
had been torn 1 , by 'the shells
and these-bfÂ£ered gt)qd s cover from the
rifle &nd m&chhie gunflre^llrected from
the rear of the.. fort. 'In. these holes 150
of the attackers had found cover: by 5
o'clock in the evening. .;: .^.
. Advancing .carefully, the Japanese
approached the Russian defenses in
the rear of the fort- and by working
from hole to . hole under cover of the
darkness the entire battalion gained
the interior of the fort, notwithstanding
the desperate resistance made by the
Russians^ '. * . /v^>;v';
The first charge made against the
wall of 'sandbags proved -unsuccessful,
but charge followed charge, until mid
night,* when the last corner of the Rus-.
sian defenses was captured.
The fighting was desperate In the ex
treme',- with bayonets and dynamite
hand grenades, and the entire garrison
was killed, with the "exception of a
party of twenty who escaped through
the covered wall, which they destroyed
behind them by exploding four mines
and thus .prevented the Japanese pur
suing them. .:â '/.; '-.*.
.. GARKISOX? DIES FIGHTING.
â¢ Though the numbers engaged' and the
area of the' fighting were small",' both
assault and defense were more v furious
than any in the previous history of the
siege of Port Arthur. With the excep
tions noted the garrison died fighting,
to the last manwith wonderful deter
mination.
The final rushes of'the Japanese were
irresistible. Their wounded refused to
retire and ;.in-siste.d on continuing the
fighting; saying' that they had vowed to
take the fort and that they must suc
ceed.
. Four field guns and three machine
guns were captured and. more than 300
Russians were killed. ,
The skillful .maner in which the sec-'
ond .assault was executed prevented
heavy losses and ensured the capture
of the fort, which, though not the larg
est, is one of the strongest of the east
ern' fortified ridge. The fort is im
portant to the'' Japanese, as* it opens
a way up the' gorge between it and the
eastern part of Keekwan Mountain and
is the easiest point at. which to pierce
the - principal line of fOrtlilcations for
the purpose of "gaining a foothold cm
the. higher hills of the fldge.
! The, stubborn resistance made by' the
Russians was duetto the fact that the
captured fort was the key "of the posi
tion at this point of their western flank.

CHRISTMAS IN ENGLAND.
Fog Falls to Dampen the Ardor of the
Britishers.
LONDON. Dec. 24.-The Christmas
spirit was abroad throughout England
to-day, notwithstanding the continued
heavy fog, which normally acts as an
extreme depressant. Not in years has
London had such a thorough dose of
that pea soup atmosphere for which the
metropolis is famous; but the popula
tion, which grumbled during the week
because of the inconveniences atten
dant upon the fog, changed Its mood
to-day, and, accepting the inevitable,
prepared to spend a merry Christmas,
even welcoming the fog as a Christ
mas gift and a friend of olden days.
In all the great homes in England the
Yule log is burning. From Sandrlng
ham to the humblest residence, rela
tives who are scattered throughout the
rest of the year are gathering to spend
the Christmas. It is estimated that
1,500.000 persons poured out of London
to-day. To those who witnessed the
tremendous rushes at every station,
the wonder was that any person could
be left to people London. But the exo
dus # leaves no appreciable mark in the
streets, which- are thronged with -mil
lions of Christmas shoppers arfd sight
seers, though the fog limits the scope
of view to about forty feet.
Most of Jhe Cabinet officers and diplo
mats have left London. King Edward
and Queen Alexandra with the immedi
ate royal family are gathered at
Sandrlngham Palace, where Christmas
will be celebrated in the usual manner.
Their Majesties will closely observe all
the Christmas customs. There will be
a Christmas tree for the royal children
around which three generations will
meet as privately as royalty ever meets
to enjoy a typical home Christmas.
Embassador. and Mrs. Choate are vis
iting Baron Mount Stephen at Brockett
Hall, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, and Sec
retary of the Embassy Henry White
has a number of guests at his country
place. Consul General Evans with his
family has gone to Paris.
Provision for the poorer classes has
been* arranged on a scale even larger
than usual and although there is an al
most Incredible number of destitute
and unemployed persons In London
there is every reason to suppose that
no one will be without some sort of
Christmas dinner.
CHICAGO IS GENEROUS.
Princely Sam Expended in the Windy
Cltr.
CHICAGO, Dec. 24.â It is estimated
that It will cost Chicago more than
$22,000,000 to celebrate Christmas this
year. Never has money been expend
ed so freely In celebrating a holiday In
the history of the city. Shopkeepers
say that people began to buy Christ
mas presents in October. As the sea
son advanced the buying of presents
became more enthusiastic. It did not
cease for a day. While most- of the
sum mentioned went- for Christmas
I gifts, the sum spent for Chri&amas* din
ners, trees and decorations is taken
into consideration In the following es
timate, the' figures being gathered from
the best sources of Information:
Estimated Christmas receipts of ten
large State-street stores, $10,300,000;
Christmas receipts of other State-street
stores, $2,500,000; Christmas receipts
from other than State-street stores,
$3,000,000; money spent for Christmas
turkeys and other poultry, 4500,000; cost
of other articles composing Christmas
dinners; $1,000,000; gifts by corporations

The chancel of the church at 1271
Mission street, which is used as the
headquarters of the Salvation Army,
was* filled yesterday morning with hun
dreds of baskets, each or which con
tained supplies for several substantial
dinners. .AH day wan-faced children,
tired-looking mothers 'and occasionally
a bent and decrepit 'Old man entered
the building, presented .their tickets
and departed heavily laden. â¢ â¢
The space before the chancel was
cleared away and there the applicants
were formed in line by Adjutant Mrs.
Danbury, Major Fynn and -Ensign. An
dersen, while Colonel ana Mrs. French
and Brigadier Wood passed out the
baskets bulging with groceries, fruits,
meats, canned goods, and the not-to
be-forgotten chickens.
As the visitors left the Headquarters
the looks of delight and thankfulness
on their faces would well have reward
ed the generous givers to the army's
cause. Tired women with a troop of
children at their heels and little tots
with old faces delightedly held aloft
magazines and papers, or tugged at
overflowing baskets, presenting a sight
that brought tears to the eyes of many
of the uniformed women, used as they
were to such things. â 
The distribution of the baskets does
not end, however, the good work of
the army. Many there were who could
not come to headquarters to receive the
needed Christmas gift, and these were
supplied by the army wagon, which de
livered hundreds erf baskets among the
homes of the poor.
To-morrow noon the army will give a
big Christmas dinner to 3000 needy per
sons at Odd Fellows' Hall, and on Tues
day night a hundred of the poorest lit
tle waifs that can be found will have
their little hearts delighted with a
Christmas tree at the headquarters, 1271
Mission street. On the same evening
trees will be provided at eight corps
stations throughout the city.
On Wednesday night the children of
the Salvation Army Sunday school will
have a Christmas tree and will be well
supplied with toys, books arid games.
Altogether the good worx of the army

The people of_ San Francisco ought to be congratulated that Dr. Chamley has
returned; he has elaborately refitted his well-known offices at -25 Third street.
The rapid increase . in his practice has . necessitated his .incorporation of .the

WEDDED FOLKS
GAIN A POINT
Supreme Court Holds Their
' Business Agreements Are
Legal Even if Informal
GIVES LAW NEW ASPECT
Transfer of Earnings From
the Common to Separate
Property Is Facilitated
By a decision of the Supreme Court
rendered yesterday in" the case of El
eonora KaJtschmidt against Adolph
Weber, as executor of the estate of
Charles G. Schneider, an agreement be
tween husband and wife by which the
latter can change 'her earnings from
community to separate ; property is
made more Informal than ever.
The plaintiff, a rooming-house keep
er, had for twenty years managed her
own business with her husband's con
sent, and during, two years had board
ed, lodged and nursed Mr. Schneider
through a most painful Illness. She
claimed $2050 for her services and the
case was tried j before a jury. Mrs.
Kalt schmidt was nonsuited, the court
holding .that she had not shown with
sufficient certainty that she was enti
tled, to the earnings she claimed as her
separate property, her husband not
having been joined as party plaintiff.
The Supreme Court, in reversing the
lower court, says that the question ad
dressed to the husband as to the man
agement and control of his wife's earn
ings should have been allowed, and
then Justice Shaw proceeds:
"Now, it may well have been the case
that the husband could recall no con
versation with his wife in which such
an agreement was distinctly expressed.
His testimony strongly indicates this
condition of memory. And yet it might
also be true that the fact that there
was such an agreement was perfectly
well understood between them. In such
a case resort may be had to circum
stantial evidence.' The conduct and ac
tions of the husband with respect to
such earnings indicating that he did
not* regard them as community - prop
erty would be competent evidence and
admissible to prove the agreement."
This is the second time that the Su
preme Court has passed upon the case.
After a decision upholding the Judg
ment of the lower court had been writ
ten by the commissioners, Arthur H.
Barendt, Charles E. Naylor and Wil
liam P. Hubbard, attorneys for Mrs.
Kaltschmidt, petitioned for a rehear
ing. This petition was granted on the
assent of six Justices, and now the
judgment has been reversed by the
unanimous opinion of the Supreme
Court.

EXTRAVAGANCE
AT SACRAMENTO
Yast Sums Are Expended
for Contingent Expenses of
the Senate and Assembly
CONTROLLER'S FIGURES
Statesmen Are Discussing
the Subject of the Patron
age for the Coming Session
Statesmen of the dominant party
who were recently elected to the Leg
islature are discussing the subject of
patronage. It is common talk that
a committee chairmanship cannot ba
given to every one of tho 110 Repub
lican members, but it Is possible to
devise a scheme of patronage that will
enable every Senator and â¢ Assembly
man to draw a small amount from the
State treasury for the Immediate re
lief of Importuning constituents.
Statesmen of liberal Inclinations fa
vor an apportionment of $12 a day
as patronage for every member of the
majority. " On this basis the Individ
ual patronage for sixty days would
amount to $79,200.
The Sacramento Union Is giving
special attention to this subject. It
remarks: "The Republican party
ought to be sobered rather than elat
ed by its exceptional responsibilities
and opportunities in the coming Leg
islative session. â¢ â¢ The first thing
the Legislature will be called upon to
determine will be the apportionment
of clerical patronage. â¢ â¢ * At
the last session each member had a
quota of patronage to give out com
puted at $20 a day, or about $1400
for the entire session â this in addi
tion to his own personal pay of $3
per day and mileage. Not only was
this method of apportioning patron
age improper and foolish, but It was
scandalously extravagant. It gave to
many members . three or four times
thi personal service they required or
could decently make use of."
The Union recently obtained from the
Controller's office figures showing the
amounts paid from the State treasury
on account of pay of officers and clerks
and contingent expenses of the Legis
lature during the last eight sessions,
together with a summary of the sal
aries of members for the same time.
The total expenses for officers, clerks,
attaches and contingent expenses, not
counting salaries of the members of
the Legislature, was $1,002,571 90. In
the eight sessions the outgo for salaries
of members was $467,520. The total ex
pense for the eight sessions was $1,
470,09190.
The record for extravagance was
made by the Thirty-seventh session of
the Legislature,- 1902. The expenses of
the Senate for that session, for officers,
clerks and contingent allowances,
amounted to' $71,183 B0. The Assembly
allowances , for service of a similar
character amounted to $$6,972. The
expenses of .both houses figured: â¢ up
$155,155 50. The record for economy
was made bv the Thirty-first session
in 1S91, when the Senate expended $43,
71137, and the Assembly $51,15613, a
total of $94,867 50. -
The cost of maintaining the State
government approximates $7,500,000 per
annum. The sums expended for main
taining courts, asylums and prisons are
large, and the salary roll of each in
stitution is something that startles
taxpayers.
RAIN IS A CHRISTMAS
PRESENT FOR FARMERS
Showers Which Cause Inconvenlenco
to Shoppers Are Boon to State's
Agricultural Interests.
The farmers of California and the
others who are interested in the agri
cultural prosperity of this State re
ceived a splendid Christmas present
yesterday in the shape of rain. The
citizens who went shopping did not
appreciate the visit of Jupiter Pluvius
quite so much, but at this time of !
year it is easy to pardon nature, even [
is she cannot let the rain fall In the
San Joaquin Valley and cause the sun i
to smile In San Francisco.
Professor McAdie of the Weather
Bureau dared last evening to call for
showers to-day, but he declares that
plenty of sunshine and cloudless skies
should be California's portion for to
morrow, the Government Christmas.
Rain fell generally over the whole
Pacific slope yesterday. The winds
ranged from twelve to thirty miles in
land and were heavier off shore. The
precipitation in San Francisco was
only .02 of an inch according to the
official rain gauge.

of Bookmaker Young
NEW YORK, Dec 24.â "Nan" Patter
son's last hope of spending Christmas
with her parents at tnetr homo in
Washington vanished to-day, when
District Attorney Jeroxna announced
that be would not agree to a reduction
of her ball. This was taken to mean
that the show girl will again bo tried

fixed at 520,000.
When the District Attorney mad*
this announcement, DanlÂ«l OTEUISt,

"This surely means that .tharÂ» wEl
bo a new trial. WÂ» are anxious that It
shall bÂ« Â«â¢*"** soon, 1 * ; . - I
Afterward he said that coc&srf bail
decided not to attempt to get Â«ny baU.
unless the District Attorney refused to
promise a speedy retrlaL
The urgency for a new trial on &â¢
part of the defense was, O'Reilly said.
due to the fact that the defense had
found some new and important evi
dence. Part of the- evidence* ho said,
was the finding of some thirty-two call*
ber bullets in Young's trunk. OiUlXty
said that Prosecutor Rand" admitted
the finding of the bullets, but contend
ed that they belonged to Mrs. Younjr.
The news that she could not be ad
mitted to bail was broken to Miss Pat
terson as gently as possible, but shs
broke down completely, after making a
brave show of cheerfulness all day.
Even though she knew she would hsv*
to remain in the Tombs over Christ
mas, she had hoped she might bÂ» re

District Attorney Jerome announced
late to-day that proceedings for a new
trial will be hurried as fast as pos

ADVERTISEMENTS.
What Sulphur Does
For the Human Body in Health and
Disease.
The mention of sulphur will recall to
many of us the early days, when our
I mothers and grandmothers gave us our
I dally dose of sulphur and molasses
1 every, spring and fall.
It was the universal spring and fall
"blood purifier," tonic and cure-all, and,
mind you, this old-fashioned remedy
|. was not without merit
{ The idea was good, but the remedy
! was crude and unpalatable, and a larga
â¢ Quantity had to be taken to get any ef-
fect.
Nowadays we get all the beneficial ef.
fects of sulphur in a palatable, concen*
trated form, so that a single grain is
far more effective than a tablespoonrul
of the crude sulphur. -^.
In recent years research and experi-
ment have proven that the best sulphur
for medicinal use Is that obtained from
Calcium (Calcium Sulphide) and sold
In drug stores under the nanxa of Stu-
art's Calcium Wafers. They are small
chocolate-coated pellets and .contain taa
active medicinal principle of sulphur la
a highly concentrated, effective form.
Few people are aware of the value of
this form of sulphur In restoring and
! maintaining bodily vigor and health:
I sulphur acts directly on the liver and
| excretory organs and purifies and en-
riches the blood by the prompt elvmtnny
tlon of waste material. - Y :
Our grandmothers knew tb3s wtum
they dosed us with sulphur ">rt mo-
lasses every spring â  and fall, but tfca
crudity and Impurity of ordinary fidto-
ers of sulphur were often worse than
the disease, and cannot compare with
the modern concentrated preparations
of sulphur, of which- Stuart's Cnlctuia
Wafers is undoubtedly the best and
most widely used.
They are the natural* antidote for
liver and kidney troubles, and core
constipation and purify the blood In a
way that often surprises patient and
physician alike.
Dr. R. M. Wilklns while experiment-
ing with sulphur remedies soon found
that the sulphur from Calcium was su-
perior to any other form. He says:
"For liver, kidney and blood troubles,
â¢especially when resulting from constl-
; pation or malaria, I have been sur-
j prised^ at the results obtained from Stu-
I art's Calcium Wafers. In patients suf-
i fering from bolls and pimples and even
| deep-seated carbuncles* I' have repeat-
â¢ edly seen them dry up and disappear In
four or five days, leaving the skin clear
and smooth. Althougfi Stuart's Calcium
Wafers is a proprietary article, and
â¢ sold by druggists, and for that reason
i tabooed by many physicians, yet I
| know of nothing so safe and reliable
for constipation, liver and kidney trou-
bles, and especially in all forms cf skin
disease, as this remedy."
At any rate people who are tired of
pills, cathartics and so-called blood
} "purifiers" will find in Stuart's Calcium
| Wafers a far safer, more palatable and
â¢ effective, preparation..

WOULD ARREST
LAW VIOLATORS
President Urges Drastic
Measures to Abate Smoke
Nuisance in Washington
COMMISSION - NOTIFIED
Executive Suggests That
Head of an Electric Light
Coni'imuy Be Cast Into Cell
WASHINGTON, Dec. 24.â Drastic ac
tion has been taken by the President
looking to the suppression of the smoke
nuisance in the city of Washington. A
letter was sent by his direction to the
District Commissioners on November
SO Inquiring if It were no^ possible to
proceed criminally against the officers
of an electric light company. He de
nounced the violation of the smoke law
by the company at the very doors of
the White House as an outrage and
urged that the managers of the com
pany bs arrested again and again, at
short intervals, in an effort to abate the
nuisance.
No response having been received
that satisfied the President, he authcrr-
Ized to-day the publication of the let
ter to the District Commissioners. It
follows:
"White House, Washington, D. C, Nov.
30. 1904.
"To the District Commissioners: The
President has again taken up with his
Cabinet the smoke nuisance so far as
the public buildings are cc-ncerned. He
would like especially to cull your at
tention, however, to the well-nigh In
tolerable manifestation of the nuisance
by the electric light company. Is it not
possible to proceed criminally against
the managers of this company? If net,
drastic legislation should be recom
mended.
"It is an outrage on the city that such
a nuisance should be permitted to ex
ist right by the White House. Almost
every hour of the day these great
chimneys can be seen emitting dense
clouds of smoke. It would seem to be
wise to go to the very limit of the law
and to arrest the head of the company
or those highest up in the company
again and again at the shortest possi
ble intervals, in order to put a stop to
this nuisance, for the conduct on their
part amounts to a flagrant defiance of
the law and of respect for pubiic opin
ion,.and. is fraught with serious
quences to the city of Washington.

GUARDS WATCH WIFE WHILE
SHE NURSES DYING HUSBAND
Officials Temporarily Release Her
From Penitentiary to Care for
Spouse, Also a Prisoner.
TACOMA, Dec. 24.â A funeral that
was pathetic in many ways was held
here Friday when Leon Carron, a con
vict at McNeil's Island Penitentiary,
who had died of consumption, was
burled in a local cemetery.
About two years ago Carron and his
wife were convicted in the Federal
Court at Spokane of Dringmg girls in
to the United States for Immoral pur
poses. Having rich and powerful
friends they made a hard fight for ac
quittal In the face of strong evidence
produced by the Federal secret service
and immigration officers. Soon after
reaching McNeil's island, Carron began
to grow thin and soon fell a victim
of consumption. Last fall he was
taken to a hospital here and later his
earnest appeals to be nursed by his
wife were granted with the result
that she was allowed to come over
from the penitentiary under guard.
She nursed him night and day for
weeks and was chief mourner at the
funeral.
Carron's brother came here from
Spokane to make the funeral arrange
ments.

THE SAM FRANCISCO CALL. SUNDAY.. DECEMBER .25. 1904.
DODGE QUICKLY
GAINS FREEDOM
Alleged Perjurer Brought
Back to New York From
Texas Is Given Release
MYSTERY IN .THE CASE
Believed to Have Turned
State's Evidence and a
Sensation Is Expected
NEW YORK. Dec. 21.â There was an
unexpected turn to the case of perjury
against Charles F. Dodge, who was
brought to this city from Texas yester
day, when he was released en his own
recognizance after arraignment before
Judge Cowing in the Court of General
Sessions to-day. Dodge was accused
of having committed perjury in testi
fying that service was not made upon
him In the suit by which a divorce
from him was obtained by his former
wife.. who subsequently married
Charles W. 2Ioree. the banker and pro
moter. After Dodge's testimony, now
alleged to havÂ« been perjured, his for
mer wife obtained a divorce from
Morse. Dodge resisted "when an at
tempt was made to bring him from
Texas, but on his arrival in this city
is said to have made a confession in
a midnight talk with the local author
ities.
Judge Cowing said after releasing
Dodge that he could not make public
his reasons for doing so at this time.
Dodge was released upon the recom
mendation of District Attorney Jerome,
who said that the ends of Justice woutd
be served by such action.
It was reported that Dodge has turn
ed State's evidence and that he will
be* a witness for the District Attor
ney in proceedings against others for
whom Dodge is supposed to have acted
as agent.
The arrival of Dodge in New York
followed one of the longest and most
bitterly fought legal battles on record,
and was the real beginning of what, it
is bel'eved, will develop into one of the
most sensational cases the metropolis
has known.
QUEER CHARGE PLACED
AGAINST GOTHAM NEGRO
l>cfendant Accused of Interfering:
With Rights of Another Colored
Man by Beating Him.
NEW YORK, Dec. 24.â A charge,
the like of which never has been en
tertained in a United. States Court in
this district within the memory of the
oldest court official, was preferred to
day against Henry Jones, a Louisville,
Ky., negro, when he was arraigned
before United States Commissioner
Shields. The charge against Jones
was interfering with the rights of a
citizen in that he beat John Supper
tonight, another" negro, so severely
that Suppertonight was unable to vote
at the last Presidential election at
Louisville.
Secret service officers had been
searching for Jones for some time and
finally located him in this city. When
arraigned before the Commissioner
to-night he waived examination and
extradition formalities and ' will be
taken back to Louisville at once by
the Federal authorities for trial.
The complaint against Jones was
sworn out by Chief Flynn of the
United States secret service.

Sioux City tire Entails a
Loss of $2,500,000 and
Throws Many Out of Work
THREE HOTELS BURNED
Man Who Lost Life Leaping
From the Fourth Story -of
Building Is Unidentified
SIOUX CITY, Iowa, Dec. 24.â Sioux
City awoke to-day with two of its bpst
business blocks in ashes, causing a
loss that may reach $2,500,000, throw-
Ing hundreds of people out of employ
ment and entailing the loss of at least
one life. . . v: -V- 1
The fire originated, "in the basement
of the Pelletier Dry Goods Company at
Fourth and Jackson streets, one of the
main corners â¢ of the city. The fire
soon spread from the Massachusetts
building to the -Toy., building, across
Jarkson street, a . seven-story struc
ture, and then leaped across Fourth
street to the Metropolitan block, which
also was a seven-story building. This,
building was only partly destrpyed," but
the Toy block and its annex on the
east were entirely burned.
Three hotels were burnedâ the West,
Leader and Pullman. All the guests
escaped in safety. The man who was
killed Jumped from the fourth story
window in the Massachusetts building.
He struck a wire and missed the net
held by the fireman. Nobody has been
able to identify him. There were no
other serious casualties.
It was not until 3 o'clock this morn
ing that the flames were finally
checked at Pierce street, after Sel
ser Brothers' wholesale liquor estab
lishment had been destroyed.
Most of the property destroyed was
reasonably well Insured and the re
building of the burned buildings will
begin in most instances as soon as fire
losses are adjusted.
The following additional detailed
losses are reported to-day:
Selzer Brothers, liquor dealers, loss
J55.000; insurance, $23,000. Dow Cloth
ing. Company, loss $65,000; insurance,
$35,000. Other losses: Higman, Skin

CESSATION* OF ACTIVITY
AFFECTS BANKS' BUSINESS
Moderate Decrease in Loans Is Shown
iti the Report or Associated
â¢ Concerns.
NEW YORK, Dec. 24.â The Financier
says this -week:" The statement *6f the
associated banks of New York City
for week ending December 24 was
rather featureless, so far as important
changes are concerned. It is obvious,
however, that, the report of the af
filiated institutions failed to disclose
the receipts of Interior money which
are floating this way, although the
statement .was somewhat complicated
by current export gold engagements,
which aggregated since the previous
Saturday about $5,000,000.
Preliminary estimates made the
week's sain in cash by the banks were
as high as $2,000,000. but the clearing
house reDort gave the increase as only
$200,000. or abo\it one-tenth the earlier
estimates. There was a moderate de
crease, of $2,627,500 in loans, due to the
cessation of activity on the Stock Ex
change and this accounts for the fall
ing off of $2,002,000 in deposits. Lessened
reserve requirements and the gain In
cash brought -the excess reserve up
$700,000 to $15,247,223, or with the elim
ination of Government, deposits, to
$21,055,900.' It is a fair inference that
with conditions continuing as at pres
ent, the chances for any decided hard
ening of money rates are not In sight.

NEW BORN BABE
ONLY AGNOSTIC
So Says Chesterton, the Eng
lish Humorist, in Address
on Aggressive Infidelity
FOND OF DD1E NOVELS
Writer Spends His Leisure
Moments! Reading of the
Great Deeds of Detectives
Special Dispatch to The Call
LONDON, Dec 24.â G. K. Chester
ton, whose "Napoleon of Notting Hill"
â not to mention his essays and biog
raphies â have made him almost as
well known in America as , he is in
this country, left London a day or two
ago for Frankfort. He gave a series
of- six lectures before the Frankfort
Academy of Social Science on the sub
ject of "English Contemporary Poet
ry." The poets dealt with Included
Tennyson and Browning. Swinburne
and the Neo-pagans, William Morris,
Kipling and W. B. Yeats.
When I saw him, recently, at his
house In Batter sea. on the Surrey side
of the Thames. Chesterton had just
returned from the church congress at
Liverpool, ' where he delivered a pi
quant address on "Aggressive Infidel
ity," which may possibly have worried
a bit some of the more fossilized of
his clerical hearers. In the course of
it the speaker declared that the only
true agnostic was a new-born babe.
He also said that It seemed to him
consonant to. the fundamental princi
ples of all religion that if he did not
believe there was a God he should go
and howl it about the streets.
The German visit over, however,
Chesterton will return home immedi
ately, to attack the perfect mountain
of work which is in front of him. The
first Item which will receive atten
tion 13 a new "Life of Dickens," which
the Methuens have commissioned
Chesterton t6' write. For these pub
lishers, too, the writer is going to pro
duce a brochure on one of the English
paintersâ similar in character to his
recent work on Watts. . The exact
artist, however, has not yet been de
cided upon. Chesterton has put aside,
for the moment, the "Life of Kings
ley," which he undertook some time
ago, but probably will recommence
work on it soon after the "Dickens" is
finished. And as if this were not
enough, the writer has also arranged
to collect and rewrite to some extent
his recent essays on religion so that
they may be published in book form
by Edwin Arnold. Needless to say. all
these works will appear in the United
States as well as in this country.
I asked about the prospects for an
other romance, on the lines of "The
Napoleon of Notting Hiil."
"I've sot another, wild idea for a
novel," Chesterton confessed, "which
probably will be about a burlesque
Anarchist circle. I hope to get at it

It some time next yearâ not much be
fore, however. I'm afraid." Mean
time his new volume of fantastic short
stories, "The Club of Queer Trades,"
will be published on both sides of the
Atlantic by j the. Harpers, probably
about the beginning of the new year.
. The writer's call on Chesterton was
made In the evening, when the humor
ist was found engrossed in the pages
of a penny-dreadful â It cost four
pence, to be exact â which rejoiced in
the title. VRadium and the Detective."
The cover of it bore a picture of a
gigantic hand turning a key in a
gigantic lock, all of which Chesterton
declared was "beautiful."
â¢ "It amuses me very much," he said.
"I like detective stories, and as I can't
get good . ones, I get the best I can.
That's a point, by Jthe way," he went
on,.* "that Is almost invariably over
looked in discussions about the public
taste in literature. They talk about
people buying, bad literature instead of
good, literature and don't see that
what people want is a certain kind of
literature. . If they can get it done
well, they will; if not, they will get
it done as well as- they can. It's Just
like tea and coffee. If I am particu
larly .fond of .the taste of coffee and
dislike tea, I will drink poorly made
coffee, should -there be no well made
coffee . procurable, in preference to
well made tea. I like detective stories
and that is why- 1 read a bad one in
preference to a work on the history
of the universe." -
Chesterton declared that while in
the country, recently he had found
himself unable to get a detective story
and had 'been driven to seek enjoy
ment by -writing one. No one who
hat- read his "Club of Queer Trades"
wty) need to be told- that it had a
highly original plot. It was revealed
to the. writer, who, however, was
asked not to disclose it, as the story
may be published sooner or later.
While telling about his literary and
other plans Chesterton amused him
self by- drawing pictures similar to
those with which he ocasionally Illus
trates his short stories on the mar
gins of his penny-dreadfuls, which, I
suppose, he resumed as soon as he
was alone.*
For* some time past Anthony Hope
has been occupied with a new novel
which is now almost finished. In spite
of the success with which the author
handled a more domestic theme in
"Double. .Harness," readers will be
glad to hear" that this new story is in
his "Zenda" style.
I hear .on the best authority that
Ibsen, whose health has been much
better of late,- Is putting the finishing
touches to a new play In which he
will eXDOund his views on war. He
holds opinion? that are diametrically
opposed to, those -of Tolstoi and will
attempt -to. prove his belief that con
flicts between nations are useful and
even necessary for. the human species,
because they sustain ideas of disci
pline, courage, will" and . personal
action.
The news that Sherlock Holmes,
after a farewell appearance at Christ
mas time, will retire for good and all
has been received, on this side of the
water â¢ at least, with modified regret.
Had Dr. Doyle been able to give us
back the Holmes -who solved the mys
tery of tho *i*SpÂ«ckled Band" and found
the horse "Silver Blaze," it is doubtful
if the jiubltc would have surrendered
him again without an indignant pro
test, but â¢ few 'â  EngrllRft ' readers have
cared greatly ' about the last "ad
ventures." Dr.^ â¢ Doyle â¢ -says that
Holmes will hereafter devote his at
tention to" bee keeping, but perhaps
Detective Lestrade may persuade him
to- "look into' a little -problem" now
and then. In that case, and provided
the sleuth of Baker street Rives a good
account' of himself, any details by-Dr.
Wht.Â«onwill be as weleome as ever to
English : readers.- They feel, however,
that otherwise the le-s written, about
Sherlock Holmes th<? better.

GREEK CABINET RESIGNS
BECAUSE OP ITS DEFEAT
King: Geonre"s Ministers Do Not Relish

eral Policy.
ATHENS. Greece. Dec 24. â The
Greek Cabinet resigned to-day In con
sequence of the defeat of the Govern
ment in the Chamber yesterday on a
vote of no confidence moved by former
Premier Delyannis. The latter sharply
criticized the Government's general
policy and M. Zaimis did the same.
King George is considering whether
to forma stop-gap Cabinet or dissolve
the Chamber and entrust M. Delyannis
with the task of forming a new-
Cabinet.

FORM IS UPSET IN RACES OVER THE OAKLAND COURSE
some horses performing peculiarly ON A MUDDY TRACK
PRINCE BRUTUS BREEZES HOME
EASIEST POSSIBLE WINNER
Squire Johnson Receives
Indifferent Handling.
an$ Is 1 Third.
ALBEMARLE IS FIRST
W- R. Condon Displays Form
Reversal by Defeating
Sol Lichtenstein.
Not even the squally weather and
the absence of good hofses yesterday
could keep the crowd away from Oak
land track. The better class of equine
jierformers were kept in the barn for
Borne reason, and the card furnished
was prolific of ragged and unsatisfac
tory sport. W. R. Condon gave a
pleasing reversal, and several other
horses displayed a lack of speed that
was truly refreshing.
The track was a sea of mud, and this
fact in a measure accounted for the
ordinary caliber of horses starting.
Two favorites only were successful.
Kunz rode an uncorked one in the
opening seven furlong event that land
ed the coin in Military, backed from
3 r . and 20 down to D. He got away in
front with the good thing, breaking
from the outside position, and, never
headed, won easily. S.ugden. which had
first call at 5 to 1, nosed out Dotterel
for the place.
IIELGESEVS POOR RIDE.
Helgesen, who piloted Squire John
eon, favorite for the two-year-old event
at six f urlonps, rode a race that earned
for him the censure of everybody level-
Ing a pair of "binoculars on the young
sters. Prince Brutus, ridden by Jakie
Jones, made a runaway race of it, win
ning off by himself. It may be that
Squire Johnson has no license to beat
the Prince, but this does not justify
the wretched exhibition furnished by
llelg-esen. The blonde jockey astride
the first choice finally succeeded In los
ing the place to Yada through his dila
tory tactics.
W. R. Condon, the horse of mystery.
came romping in first for the Futurity
course selling number. How to account
for the previous poor showing in a race
made by Louis Ezell's horse when a
favorite the little statuettes in the park
museum hold the secret, and they are
dumb and cannot tell. At all events,
the price about Condon touched 4^6,
then came the play. Anderson, usually
Elow, was a barrier champion on this
occasion, and, Eoon showing clear of
the field, the result was never In doubt.
Helgcsen rode a ridiculously bad race
on the favorite, Sol Lichtenstein. ar
riving at the wire in time to beat
Cousin Carrie for the place. Sir Preston
â and Revolt both ran disgustingly bad
races.
FAVORITE IS FOURTH.
Dr. Rowell's Briers started favorite
for the mile and a sixteenth selling af
fair, and finished fourth. Possibly she
figured to run there. North \Vest, an
8 to 1 shot, with Greenfield in the sad
dle, got away from the barrier fifth and
â¢was not headed. Now that Is giving
Barney Oldfleld something of a brush.
North West received backing from a
select few. who do not give out their
triple X epeclals until after 1:23 o'clock.
Lady Kent ran second and Colonel An
derson, a non-mudder, third. As before
etated, then followed Briers, the fav
orite.
There was nothing to the seven-fur
long run, also decided under selling
conditions, but Albemarle. Ridden by
Kunz and heavily backed, he went out
and spreadeagled his field. Bard Burns
ran second and Mr. Farnum third.
Mountebank, the second choice, ran
like a 100 to 1 shot.
Everything suited Dungannon In the
closing mile selling event, and with
Davis up, the filly dropped In the easi
est eort of a winner. Dusty Miller took
the place from Scherzo, a well backed
ese. The winner went to the post a 0
to 6 favorite. >

Superintendent of the Track William
Fleldwick was presented with a hand
some rubber-tired buggy, whip, robe
and harness by the employes of the
track yesterday. Bill was too full for
utterance to say more than "thanks,"
being overcome by the unlooked-for
visitation of Santa Claus. \-f ;-â 
' Twenty-nine bookmakers cut in yes
terday, the largest number of the sea
son. Jim Neil and "Plnkey" Potter
were among the new comers.
The sudden reversal of form Bhown
by W. R. Condon and the fact that cer
tain well-known heavy speculators bet
on the Ezell horse will be investigated
by the stewards.
The two peculiar looking rides of Hel
gesen on Squire Johnson and later as
tride Sol Lichtenstein, gained few ad
mirers for the blonde rider. They will
also receive a probing by the officials.
Last season at Oakland Solomon Bon
ner, the colored rl^er, Incurred the ofli
cial wrath and was suspended. At the
close of the meeting across the way he
was given permission to ride for his
employer, Charley McCafferty, alone.
Yesterday the stewards restored Bon
ner to good standing on probation, and
he will now be seen in the saddle
oftener.

MOST NAVAD 3EEN HAVE
VERY TENDER HEARTS
Sympathetic as Children When the
Welfare of a Cat Is
Concerned.
The woman superintendent of the
Tyne Nautical School of Cookery gives
an interesting picture of the merchant
seaman as he really is.
Jack Merchantman, she says, wears
no special picturesque dress, which
possibly detracts from the interest he
arouses. In fact, he fiercely resents
those firms who insist on "uniform;"
he loudly declares that "he won't be
any man's lackey," and on "the brass
bounder" is poured forth the vitriol of
his scornful tongue.
It Is the ambition of Jack's life to be
counted "a wideawake bird," not
caught by chaff and not In the least
Boft-hearted.
Sailors are absurdly diffident and shy.
With careful handling they may come
to regard a school to which they attach
themselves &s a second home, and even
fiercely resent any interference with it,
yet the appearance of a stranger at
one of their classes will cause a general
stampede, even when It Is convincingly
shown that pecuniary as well as other
prudential reasons should induce them
to remain.
No class of men has so large a ten
derness for children, as well as all ani
mals. The lean, harried cat, denizen
of mean streets, seems to have a sixth
sense when she flies to the forecastle
of a convenient ship as an asylum
where she is carefully fed and nursed
back to health. A family of three kit
tens-and their mother were the joint
property of the carpenter and boat
swain. No royal babies ever received
greater attention. It was even stated
that the former vacated his own berth
in order that the mother and her tribe
might be comfortably housed. And the
pussies on their part were graciously
pleased to accept the homage of their
subjects. â Navy League Journal.
Picturesque Padua.
Padua, in spite of Its flat surround
ings, is one of the most picturesque
cities of Upper Italy, and the seeker
after gardens will -find many charming
bits along the narrow canals or by the
sluggish river skirting the city walls.
Indeed, one might almost Include In a
study of gardens the beautiful Prato
della Valle, the public square before
the church of Saint Antonio, with Its
encircling canal crossed by marble
bridges, Its range of baroque statues
of "worthies,',' and its central expanse
of turf and trees. There is no other
example In Italy of a square laid out in
this park-like way, and the Prato della
Valle would form an admirable model
for the treatment of open spaces in a
modern city. â Century.
The largest loaves of bread baked
in the world are those of France and
Italy. The "pipe" bread of Italy Is
baked In loaves two feet or three feet
long, while In France the loaves are
made in the shape of* very long rolls,
four or five feet in length, and in
many cases six feet.

Fraud hi Textiles.
The amount of deception that* is
practiced In the manufacture of all
kinds of textiles is far greater than
most people have any conception of.
There are very few heavyweight wool
en cloths that are free from such sub
stances as shoddy or cotton. They
serve there a useful purpose of giving
weight and warmth to thV garment at
a comparatively low cost, without de
tracting from its outward appearance
and possible richness. Shoddy is the
article mostly depended on for heavy
weight goe"ds, but for the lighter
weight goods cotton is the thing, be
cause it can be spun to a finer thread.

nOW HE WAS TAUGHT
WELL MERITED LESSON
Coachman Who Suffered Rather Than
Descend From His Dignified
Position.
A wealthy broker is so fond of flow
ers he frequently spends some time
in and about his plants, sometimes
doing a little gardening himself. A
few days ago he thought he would
water some plants, so he called to his
new coachman, who was standing
near a watering can, and told him to
fill it and bring It to him.
"Beg pardon, sir, I'm the coach
man," said the importation, touching
his hat.
"Well, that's all right; bring that
can here."
"Beg pardon, sir, I'm the coach
man." . Zsi
"Well, well, I know that. Bring
the can here. I want It."
The coachman touched his hat and
still made the same reply. Then
something dawned on the broker.
"Oh," he said, "you're the coach
man and can't bring. the can. Well,
coachman, go and have the black
team hitched to the family carriage
and bring It here. Have one of the
'ostlers ride on the box with you."
The coachman touched his hat
again respectfully and went. Pres
ently he drove up In style.
"Now," said the broker, "drive to
where that can Is; and you, 'ostler,
pick it up, get, back on the box, drive
'round to the stable with the coach
man, fill It with water and have him
drive you back again."
It was done and the can brought,
filled. : â¢;:â * â .'â¢â â¢â 
"Now, 'ostler," said the broker,
"you may go. Coachman, you remain
where you are. I may need* you
again. Don't drive away until I give
you leave." ;
The coachman saved his dignity, but
he sat on the seat in that coach for two
hours after the broker had finished
watering the flowers. â Tit-Bits.

accounted for by the fact that the com

some people on the ground that poor

have led to an undue reduction In the

at 45 per cent.
The slides are pieces of crown

AND RELEASED ON BAIL
PROHISES TO SETTLE
MA2CAGER AND EPAIUUN'G PARTNER OF BATTLING NELSON* tTHO Wrnra
INTERCEPTED AT STOCKTON ON THEIR WAY EAST BECA^SF THFT tt
TLE FIGHTER CLAIMED THEY WERE i GETTING AWAY VOTH 'HIS cIlN.
*"I want my money," Battling Nelson
etlll declares. He has not the exact
"f.gures of what Is coming to him, for
his fist Is better at punching than pen
ning. The bitter feeling he cherished
usainst his manager. Ted Francis Mur
phy, seems to have vanished since the
latter was brought back and the money
l:j dispute placed in safety.
"It's the fault of a lot of knockers,"
.declares tha boy manager. "They
.wanted to get Nelson away from me
.because he is making a little money
tow. I hope nobody thinks that I tried
to ret away with the money. That Is
foolish."
The $9001 is in the property clerk's
cSce at the Hall of Justice, Nelson
end the boy manager held a friendly
conversation last night and all the dif
ferences may be amicably settled.
Moreover it Is eaid that the Dane may
retain Ted as manager.
.â¢â¢ iLurphy and Eddie Santry were
brought from the Stockton Jail yester
day by Detective Taylor. On their
arrival at the Hall of Justice Judge
.Cabaniss ordered Santry released on
his own recognizance.' Murphy was re
leased on 54000 bail, whicn was quickly
furnished by Zick Abrams and David
'Sullivan.
The $3001 bankroll was placed in
charge of the property clerk " of the
â¢Police Department. Murphy gladly
â consented to this. Nelson could not
eee for some time that the bit of paper
represented real money. He wanted
the coin that he had fought for. "Let's
have a settlement right Here," he said.
"All I want is my money."
"That would be compounding a fel
ony." said the Judge, who was de
termined that Battling should not get
the worst of it.
"What's the difference," said the
illogical Dane- "All I want is -my
â money.".
Murphy la much disturbed over the
rumors that have .been wired broadcast
regarding him. At the City Prison he
roade a hasty calculation regarding
TCelEon'a Ehare of the draft for $9001
he held. He claims that Nelson's part
la between JS500 and $3700. The rest,
ilurphy maintains, belongs to himself.
Battling was seen last night at Harry
Corbett's. He was not going to prose
cute, he said. All he wanted was a
settlement and he was not seeking any
other manager. Murphy was still his
manager and he contemplated no
change. â -..
"Bat" complained . of loss of sleep
caused by worry over the coin which
he feared was lost to him. He wanted
to go to his couch and get a large rest.
All the differences between himself and
Murphy will be settled some time to
day, he says.
When seen at the Hall of Justice,
Murphy expressed great surprise at
Nelson's move in swearing out the war
rant. He expected the Dane to follow
him East. He produced figures to show
that he was the most generous of man
agers.
The only difference between the state
ments of the youthful magnate and the
fighter is the percentage of receipts
they had verbally agreed upon as the
manager's share. Nelson says It was
25 per cent. Murphy declares It was
23 per cent and says that he can prove
this by witnesses.
"Nelson's share of the $9001." said
Murphy last night, "is $3700. It was
agreed between us that I should get 35
per cent of what he earned. I let him
off with less in fights where there was
little money. Why, in his first fight,
four years ago, I only took $20 and
spent it a minute later. I stood by
him when he could not fight. It's just a
case of knockers trying to get Battling
and throw me down."
Murphy received a telegram" from
hlÂ« sister in Milwaukee yesterday. It
read: "Heard rumors. Don't believe

them. Merry Christmas." One of the
reasons that caused the hasty trip,
Murphy says, was the news that Eddie
Santry's mother was dying.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 25, 1904.
CLEW TO SLAIN
GIRL'S IDENTITY
Cutler Hill Murder Victim
Is Believed to Be Young
Woman From New York
MISSING SOME TIME
Description of Female, Even
to Dentistry, Fits That of
Maid Killed in Colorado
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Dec. 24.
An entirely new clew and one that
looks good to Chief. Reynolds has de
veloped as a result of the excellent de
scriptions of the dentistry sent over the
country by the press. The clew comes
from Syracuse, N. Y., where it is learn
ed that a girl named Kemter is miss
ing. The girl came to Colorado Springs
a year ago and in October a check for
$200 was sent "to her, which she ac
knowledged as receiving. Since that
time nothing has been heard from her
and her family believe that she is the
victim -of the Mount Cutler murder.
Investigation by Chief Reynolds brings
out the fact that the dentistry of the
missing Miss Kemter tallies exactly
with that of the dead girl as does also
the hair and height.
A dispatch received from Syracuse to
night is to the effect that the family
has directed a sister of Miss Kemter,
who is now in California, to proceed to
Colorado Springs at once and either lo
cate her sister or identify the remains.
Officers now * engaged in attempt
ing to solve the Mount Cutler murder
mystery are working on what they
claim to be the best clew yet secured.
The new theory on which they are
working is that the deceased was a
member of one of the theatrical
troupes that visited this city during
tho past two months and was put out
of the way by some male member of
the company on account of jealousy.
The police are now in telegraphic

CUBA TO HAVE ANOTHER
UP-TO-DATE TKOLLEY ROAD
Americans to Build Railway From
Cienfuegos to Cruccs â Work Will
Begin This Fall.
An electric railway from Cienfuegos
to Cruces, a distance of twenty-three
miles, is now an assured fact, says
the Cuba Bulletin. The plans are
complete. The work will begin this
fall. It is expected the road will be
in operation in qne year.
The name of the company con
structing the road is the Cienfuegoa,
Palmira and Cruces Railway and
Power Company. Bruno Diaz is the
president and C. C. Vermuele of 203
Broadway, New York City, is the con
sulting engineer.
The cars will be forty feet long,
equipped with all up-to-date railway
conveniences and improvements and
patterned 'after the regular standard
interurban railroad cars like those in
use in the subway in New York.
The building of the road itself of
fers but few difficulties, as there are
no steep grades or other obstacles to
overcome. The main task is the
building of the reservoir, dam and
power-house, some twenty-eight miles
from Cienfuegos, among the hills, dif
ficult of access, making the transpor
tation of building materials a tedious
process. Two thousand acres of virgin
forest must be cleared* to make room
for the buildings and reservoir. The
source of Dower for the new road is
the falls of the Hanabanilla River.
A dam will be built at the head of
the fall3 flfty feet high. The water
will be diverted through a tunnel
part of the way, farther on through
steel tubes to the power-house. A
fall of 480 feet is calculated upon,
which will develop 4000 horsepower
needed for the operation of the road,
although 7000 horsepower Is avail
able. The company will also supply
light and power to all towns along its
route. Americans will build the road,
which will eventually be extended to
Santa Clara. â New York Commercial.
Bouncing Big Babies.
Well authenticated Instances of chil
dren weighing at birth as much ae thir
teen pounds are of extreme rarity.
Among 15,166 children born in Chrobak's
clinic in Vienna only one weighed 6300
grammes (11% pounds), while in seven
years at the Clinic Baudelocque, in
Paris, there were only six children who
exceeded 6000 grammes (11 pounds) at
birth, the largest weighing 6160
grammes (13% pounds). Dubois, in 1897,
collected twenty-eight cases In which
the child weighed more than 6600
grammes (12 pounds) at birth and stat
ed that the heaviest children on record
weighed, respectively, 24 pounds 3
ounces, 24 pounds 2 ounces and 23
pounds 12 ounces. â London Lancet.
Imprisonment for Chauffeurs.
Newport, R. I., Is an excellent place
for setting the fashion of sending reck

repeated violations of the law against
excessive speed. The example giren
by Justice Darius Baker in the Rhode
Island seaside resort, when he sent
Michael Woods, chauff eur . f or Alfonso
de Navarro, to Jail for five days, is
needed in many other places. When
reckless use of powerful vehicles, capa

Gambling In Former Days.
We hear a good deal of gaming In
hares and other ways by society wom
en to-day, says the Liverpool Post. In
former days many titled women not
only gambled, but kept gambling hells.
In 1745 the Baroness Mordington, who
kept one of these establishments In
the great Piazza, Covent Garden, ap
pealed to the House of Lords on the
plea of her peerage to protect her from
the intrusion of the law officers. Hap
pily the Lords decided that no person
is entitled to privilege of peerage
against any prosecution for keeping a
gaming house. Perhaps the most no
torious gamestre8s, however, was the
Countess of Buckinghamshire, who, In
1797, was fined Â£50 for gaming, while
the man who kept the faro table for
her was fined Â£200.
An extraordinary series of thefts
were perpetrated at the house of the
distinguished culpit, and the ruin of
many men was traceable to her estab
lishment. Among the notable names
which occur in the last of gamblers of
the old days there come at once to
mind those of Lords Halifax. Anglesey
and Shaf tsbury. It was of this trio
that Locke tells the story of his sit
ting by and writing down the exple
tives they uttered as they sat at play.
Being questioned as to his occupation,
he replied to Lord Anglesey: "My
lord, I am anxious not to lose anything
you utter" â an Irony which made the
three ashamed and put an end to their
gaming. â Exchange, i

liquors, as 'Hum tie Dumtie,* 'Three
Threads,* 'Four Threads,' 'Old Pha
raoh,' 'Knockdown,' "Hugmatee,"
'Shouldree,' 'Clamber Clown,' 'Hotpots/
'Newgate Market.' 'Fox -comb,' "Blind

turesque potations seem as far removed
"from popular English memory as Wil
liam of Orange himself, popular though
they apparently were in his reign, and
their very names are now a puzzle to
antiquarians, though "Old Pharoah"
and "Knockdown" (the latter likewise
known as "Camberscull") are remem
bered as .strong "Yorkshire" ales,
"Humty Dumpty" as a fearsome mix
ture of ale boiled with brandy, and

Professor's Allegations Ee
garding Belief in Im

DEFENSE FOR LIBERALS
Berkeley Pastor Declares
That Unitarians General
ly Hold the Doctrine
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Dec 24.
Professor G. H. Howlson's remarks
of last Sunday concerning the BO-cailed
â¢â liberal" churches' attitude toward the
doctrine of immortality has been an
ew ered by Rev. Earl Morse Wilbur,
minister of the Unitarian church of
Berkeley.
In an open letter Issued to-day Rev.
Mr. Wilbur quotes from the reDort of
Professor Howison's address in The
Call of last Monday, as follows: "One
whole group of Christians â the so
tailed liberal group â has ceased* to be
lieve it. They do not object, I under
stand, to any member of their body
cherishing the belief, but it is not of
their formal tenets of faith."
With this as a text, the Unitarian
minister, who also is dean of the Uni
tarian Theological Seminary, discussed
the allegation as follows:
. ' "I intend no newspaper controversy
with or.e for whom I have bo high re
gard as Professor Howison, and, in
deed. I trust that the report does not
represent the speaker's deliberate opin
ion; but I should be untrue to my own
faith, and unworthy of the cause that
I represent in this community, if I suf
fered such a report credited to such a
pource to cass without notice. And I
vish here simply to say that it is
far from representing the,, real state of
belief among Unitarians as I have
known them during some fifteen years
in the ministry, and with a tolerably
wide acquaintance among their leaders.
"The Unitarian Church has no formal
creed that one must assent to before
joining it. While it appreciates the
Importance to the individual of clear
thelogical opinions, it holds that no
person or church should impose them
upon him as a condition of Christian
fellowship. No Unitarian Church would
dream of asking a candidate what he
believed as to immortality or any other
doctrine before admitting" him to mem
bership. It would ask no more than
to be assured of his sincere desire to
lead a Christian life.
"But it would be a grave mistake to
conclude from this attitude that the
Unitarian Church, as a whole, or that
â¢ !:>â¢ considerable proportion of it, has
ceased to hold the faith in immortal
ity. Numerous statements of . what
Unitarians believe are published, and
they are often said (I believe with
truth) to come nearer to representing
the average level of Unitarian belief
than the standard orthodox creeds to
representing that of those that pro
fess them. I have just examined near
ly a. score of these, and have found
that without exception they express
faith in immortality in unequivocal
terms; and they represent, I am sure,
the consenting opinion of the leaders
of Unitarian thought, the radical as
well as t*ie conservative.
"Most modern Unitarians, it is true,
are as far from believing that the
body of Jesus ever rose from the
dead as they are from believing that
his spirit ever died at all. i Their con
fidence in a future life is based rather
on the inherent nature of the human
eoul, its kinship with God, and the
reasonableness of His universe.

.."Dean of the Unitarian Theological
.' School."

SHARE THE JOYS
OF CHRISTMAS
By Zoe Green Radcllffe,

that "it is more blessed to give than, to
receive" so well as Mrs. J. A. Folger.
Ker heart and- hand are always open
to the call of charity, but at Christ
mas time it is her delight to extend
her giving and make glad many hearts
outside her own fortunate circle of in
timates and kin. This year Fabiola
Hospital and the Associated Charities
are each the richer to-day by $50,
while two free kindergartens â the
Oakland and Central â are rejoicing
over the $25 check that each received
as a Christmas gift from Mrs. Folger.
Mrs. Robert Watt also bestowed a
generous Christmas present upon Fab
iola in the form of a. check for $25.
There are many other generous
women in Oakland with" means to sat

Every year Mrs. Oscar Luning has a
gorgeous tree for dozens of little chil
dren in her neighborhood, who but
for her kindly thought would see little
difference between Christmas and any
other day. The other day Mrs. A. A.
Moore Jr. entertained fifty little people
with a fairy tree that yielded mo'st
wonderful fruit and before the sea
son is over many more examples, of
such commendable keeping of the
Yuletide will come to light.
To-morrow the home of the Thomas
Prathers will look like a scene from
seme fairy tale. An immense tree is
being laden with gifts that will find
their way into the hands of half a
hundred merry children to-morrow.
The beautiful ballroom of the A. L.
Stones has been transformed into a
bewitching headquarters for Santa
Claus, and the children of the Egbert
Stones, the Detricks, the Havemeyers,
the McNears, the Macdonalds and the

big Christmas gathering.
Every one is 6till talking of the Chan
selor Christmas tea. Everything was
on a most elaborate scale and the
gorgeous gowns, the beautiful decora
tions and the wonderful tree all fur
nished food for endless delightful gos
sip and delicious memories that future
Christmases will always revive. The
guests chose their own packages from
the tree and, when denuded of their en
velopes of tissue paper and red rib
bon, revealed rare bits of bric-a-brac
and various articles of value.
In the musical geography Oakland is
once more on the map. Paderewski re
ceived an ovation yesterday that
equaled, if it did not surpass, any en
thusiastic demonstration of our criti

audience â unusually large considering
the fact that much Christmas shopping
was still to do â greeted the great artist
and compelled him to give three en
cores after his last number. Paderews
ki was very gracious with his encores.

SAVANTS FIND
WORM SECRETS
Scientists at University An

Curious. Investigations
TWO BULLETINS ISSUED
Professor Kofoid Directs the
Examination Under Mi
croscope of Tiny Crawlers
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
â¢2148 Center Street. Dec. 24.
Bulletins of unusual importance and
interest to the scientific world were
issifed to-day by the University of Cal
ifornia, one being the work of Pro
fessor John F. Bovard. who worked
with Professor C. A. Kofoid In solving
the problem of the distribution of the
sense organs" in microscolex, or the
California earth worm, and the other
an elaborate treatise by Harry Beal
Torriey upon the hydroids of the San
Diego region.
*" The interesting method by which
the worms were prepared for examin
ation <s described by Professor Bo
vard. The worms were allowed to
swim about awhile water to free
them from grit and dirt, and were
then killed by allowing alcohol to
drip into the dish at the rate of 60
drops a minute. Thus the worms
were stupefied. After being hardened
they were preserved In alcohol. The
cuticle was then removed and
mounted. The plan was to count all
the sense organs in the entire cuticle
and to plat these so that their dis
tribution in any part might be seen
at a glance. A high magnification
was necessary.
The work was carried on in the
zoological laboratory of the Univer
sity of California under the guidance
of Professor Kofoid. Professor Bo
vard says: "The total number of
sense organs in a single lumbricus was
approximated by Miss Langdon ('95)
at 150.000. while for a microscolex of
103 segments only 14,787 were found.
Thus microscolex, with approximately
one-fourth the surface of lumbricus,
has only, one-tenth as many sense
organs.
"The distribution of the sense organs
suggests that the surface of the worm
is not equally sensitive in. all parts.
Experiments to determine the sensi
tiveness were made, with alcohol and
acids as Irritants, sugar and quinine as
taste stimulants. A fine capillary
pipette was used for applying alcoholic
solutions of 1 per cent and less, so
that a small quantity could be applied
to a small area. The time betweten
the application and some direct mani
festation of irritation was recorded by
a stop watch. The records show that
the anterior end is more sensitive than
the posterior, and the posterior more
than the middle' part. Solutions of
quinine of one-thousandth of 1 per
cent and even less gave the same re
sults as the alcohol. The fact that the
animals reacted to the quinine may
indicate that the sense organs have
some gustatory function. This might
be ' expected, for the difference in
structure between' sense organs on the
outside of the body and those of the
pharynx is very slight. The sense or
gans of the pharynx are lower and a
great deal broader than the others.
The results of the last set of experi
ments are of importance because they
show that the degree of sensitiveness
inferred front the differences in time
reactions of a given region is corre
lated with the number of sense or
gans found therein. The ratio of the
number of organs in the anterior end
to those of the posterior is 3 : 2, while
the ratio of time reactions is approxi
mately A : 7. Thus the ratio of the
numbers of sense organs in tÂ»wo given
areas is approximately inversely pro
portional to that of the time . re
actions."

ly laid it down that a boarding-house

It was against a Bloomsbury board
ing-house proprietor that this interest-
Ing decision was obtained. Bloomsbury
is the district In which most American
visitors congregate. For their express
accommodation most of the houses
have been transformed into boardlng
hooses conducted on the American
plan, all the guests taking their meals
together. The English system is that
of the lodging-house In which patrons
rent furnished apartments and do their
own catering, or make some arrange
ment with tha landlady by which meals
are served to them in their own rooms.
As a concession to the prejudices of
enobbery the boarder is usually termed
a "paying guest."
In the case In Question a Blooms
bury boarding-house keeper, acting In
accordance with custom and precedent,
seized the luggage of one of her guests
who owed her $42. But this particular
guest had done what apparently no
ether person similarly situated had
done before â he had looked up the law
on the subject. He brought suit for
$250 damages for unlawful detention
of his personal effects. He was award
ed only $25, but the important thing
was that he knocked out what had
heretofore b^en supposed to be the in
disputable right of boarding-house
proprietors to levy on their guests' ef
fects when board bills are not paid.
Incidentally It was brought out that
the English law, which is muqh given
to hair-splitting, recognizes a fine dis
tinction between' a 'lodging-house "and
r boarding-house. Under the act -of
1S63 an {nn-keeper may detain the goods
of a guest who fails to settle his bill.
The same right is accorded the lodg
ing-house keeper. But the act takes
no cognizance of the boarding-house
keeper, and according to Judge Wood
fall he or she in the matter of col
lecting bills cannot claim the privileges
of cither the Inn-keeper or the lodging
house keeper, and has no right to im
pound the baggrage of a defaulting
patron. The "paying guest" can be
made to pay only by means of a sum
mons or suit. The decision has caused
great consternation in Bloomsbury,
and there Is talk cf appealing for a
epecial act of Parliament, or turning
all the boarding-houses into lodging
houses.

Scaly
scalps
Nine people out of every
ten have trouble with their
heads. Many of them
suffer from a species of
eczema, which forms a dry
scale upon the skin of
the scalp, popularly known
as dandruff.
If this condition be
neglected the hair follicle
loses all its vitality, the
hair becomes brittle and
falls out and baldness is
the inevitable result.
Coke Dandruff Cure has
proved to be the only
reliable cure fnr this
annoying condition. It
positively removes, with
on$ or two applications,
every trace of dandruff.
Faithfully used it will cure
every diseased condition of
the scalp (except
.constitutional biood
disorders), will
produce a luxuriant, glossy
growth of hair after all
other remedies have failed.
This is a strong
statement and one which
we would not dare to make
if we were not in
possession of thousands of
grateful letters from people
in every walk of life, who
have proved, to their
intense gratification, the
wonderful powers of
Coke Dandruff Care.

TOBACCO TRUST
BEGINS A WAR
Is Opening Stores in City
to Fight Local Dealers
Who Have Become Defiant
KEW PRICES THE CAUSE
American Company Said to
Have Imposed Conditions
That Are Unreasonable
The smoke of battle envelops the to
bacco dealers of the city these days.
The wholesale jobbers have leagued to
fight the trust, known as the Ameri
can Tobacco Company, and the trust
In turn has declared war to the knife
on the local dealers. It Is planning to
open retail stores about the city, In the
expectation of corraling the trade. The
"un-American" Tobacco Company must
cuff this end of the continent from its
trade, the band of jobbing houses an
nounces. The San Francisco whole
salers must buy their goods from the
trust or be whiffed out of existence,
declares the trust savagely. With Its
control of all the popular brands it be
lieves that it can easily humiliate the
rebellious spirits.
The Jobbing houses of Seattle, Port
land, Sacramento and Los Angeles
have joined issue with the San Fran
cisco merchants, but it Is In this city
that preparations are going forward to
wage the fiercest war.
The trouble began over an announce
ment of new quotations for plug to
baccos by the American Company. The
dealers say that the' conditions Im
posed were outrageous. The wires to
the East sagged with their burden of
protests from ' the firms. The trust
was abrupt in its reply. When the
dealers showed indignation, the great
corporation became haughty. And
when the jobbers sent a joint tele
gram denouncing the position of the
trust as arbitrary, unjust and coer
cive, the trust in effect told them to
draw long on their pipes and dream
a bit of what it meant to defy its
power.
"Our capital, 'our selling staffs and
our distributive power iq subject solely
to our own dictation," came the hot
declaration of Independence from the
Jobbers.
BOYCOTT THE TRUST.
Immediately It was resolved . by the
dealers to cease handling any of the
products of the American Tobacco
Company, not alone the plug tobaccos,
but cigars and cigarettes as well.
Every effort should be made, it was
unanimously agreed, to encourage the
sale of the goods manufactured by the
existing independent monufacturers
and to aid the starting of- new fac
tories. It was directed that steps be
taken to advertise this resolution
throughout the country.
The methods of the trust were
drastic. It adopted the course calcu
lated to humble. Â£he Jobbers with the
most dispatch. Agents were sent to
San Francisco and opening of stands
about the city has been started in
which the American Company will
supply its goods direct to the con
sumer. The ownership of the store is
presumably sold, subject to contract
as to what brands of tobaccos, cig
arettes and cigars shall be handled.
A large majority of the retail stores
are owned by the Jobbers and the at
tack of the trust falls directly upon
them, both In wholesale and retail
business. But the Jobbers are yet un
dismayed, for they feel assured that
they cannot be so easily swept out of
the market. The leases for stands in
good locations are not to be had very
readily in buny San Francisco now
adays and possession of most of them
for some time to come Is regarded as
nine points in the fight
WAR WAXES 3iERRIIiY.
Both Eldes are working ener
getically. The trust has secured a few
excellent locations for retail stores al
ready, but they have been blocked in
many instances.
.It was early In the present month
that the new Quotations on certain
plug tobaccos arrived and started the
trouble. The most Important of the
brands Involved were Star. Horse
Shoe, Drummond's Natural Leaf,
Piper-Heldsick, Spear Head, Granger
Twist and J. T. On these the trade
discount of 7 per cent was withdrawn,
and In Ueu of this rebates of 2 or 3
cents a pound were to be allowed, sub
ject to a condition as to the. quantity
that should be taken every half year.
It Is the binding themselves to pur
chase a stated quantity through the
half year that the Jobbers objected to
particularly. If the wholesalers could
handle the goods on this basis there
would virtually be no increase In
prices of the pood*. But the danger
of being left long on the stocks that
the trust sars must be contracted for
six months ahead would' always be
Imminent, declare the Jobbers, and
profits might easily be consumed in
the overstocking.
The Jobbers had long been In utmost
harmony with the trust and inde
pendent manufacturers have had far
from clear sailing from them. But
now has come the falling out and San
Francisco Is to be treated to a lively
war of smoke.

The Board of Education yesterday
ordered two portable schoolhouses
sent, to the Bergerot School and one to
the Sutro School to relieve their over
crowded condition.' Superintendent
I^angdon urged that relief be afforded
the â Sutro School, while School Direc

the Bergerot. The board decided to
comply with both recommendations.
The two houses for the Befgerot
School will be sent from the Dudley

has several additions. The Dudley

Mint .Employes Can Now
Enjoy a Jtl^rry Christmas
Untempered With Worry
DISAPPEARS STRANGELY
Metal Slips Through the
Machinery for Whiting
Room and Puzzles Clerks
... â¢
The gloom that has prevailed during
ye merry holiday times in the silver
department of the United States Mint
in this city has given way to joy â the
sort of Joy that comes with the lifting
of a burden of troubles from the mind.
This burden has rested heavily for
some months on the. devoted caputs of
the Mint employes and has threatened
to wear away the hair. ,
About six months ago it was reported
to. Superintendent Leach that there
was a shortage in the silver account,
and no one seemed able to give the
slightest clew to the mysterious dis
appearance of a number of ounces of
the white metal. Weeks wore / away,
and more and more silver was "weigh
ed in short" after it had passed the
whiting room.
Careful search was made of all the
nooks and corners of the room and ev
ery employe was kept constantly un
der the keen eyes of the Mint officials./
Finally the shortage grew Into the
hundreds of ounces, and the assistance
of the secret service was requested
and obtained. Every man and woman
who had anything to do with the silver
and whiting room were carefully in
vestigated, but nothing developed to
show that they were following other
than "the straight and narrow 'path."
"Uncle" Dan Cole, the official coiner,
and Refiner Gorman began to see
visions of f)immicky days, and there
was a spirit of unrest among the heads
of all departments that became all the
more aggravating as Christmas ap
proached. The officials commenced to
dream of suit cases full of silver bricks
disappearing into the dark shadows of
Fifth street on stormy nights. The se
cret service men said "We're sorry,
but hanged if we can find where the
metal has gone to."
The season's - gladsome greetings
came a few days ago, when the en
gineer of the whiting department,
where the silver coins are given their
white, unpolished appearance, an
nounced that he thought he had the
answer to the puzzle.
"What do you think?" asked the su
p'erintendent. ; '
"I think that the metal is somewhere
in. the machinery," replied the engineer.
"Well, I'm afraid you're wrong, but
we will investigate," replied the chief,
official.
In. -the whiting process, by some
means as yet undetermined by the re
finers, the silver had been deprived of
a certain fractional part of its bulk
and.the infinitely, small particles grav
itated toward a common centerâ the
cylinder of one of the machines. The
machinery was taken apart after a
great deal of labor, and snugly settled
in one corner of it were 420 ounces of
the missing metal. There is not sup
posed to be any more valuable depos
its in the coinmaking plant, as 'the
amount mentioned makes up the dis
turbing shortage.
And there is a merry Christmas â a
very merry Christmas â at the stately
stomr edifice where- Uncle Sam fur

Bucket Shop Men Discharged.
After a fight lasting over four years
the case of W. D. Valentine, M. Burke
and A. C. Pritchard, charged with con
ducting a bucket shop on Ellis street,
was dismissed by Judge Cook yester
day. The trio were convicted in the
Police Court and fined in the aggre
gate $900. The Superior Court af
firmed the judgment of the lower court
and the defendant's attorney, George
D. Collins, appealed to the Supreme
Court. Meantime the defendants had
been taken Into custody and an appli
cation >was made before Judge Cook
for a writ of habeas corpus. Decision
on the writ was .postponed till the Su
preme Court should render judgment,
which was finally given against the
appellants. The ordinance under
which the arrests were made was sub
sequently repealed.

that under the charter the plaintiffs
could not maintain such an action.
Plaintiffs complained of the washing
away of much of the soil of their prop
erty on J street, between Tenth and
Eleventh avenues, by sewage from the
Almshouse tract. The street at this
point was made impassable by : the
seepage^ It Is held by the court that
the charter prohibits recourse against
the city for any damage or loss suf
fered by reason of the defective con
dition of any sewer. This' suit resulted
from the improper construction of the
sewer.

THE RESPITE
Investigation of â¢ the Police
Affairs in Chinatown Is
Deferred Over Christmas
ELLIS 'GIVES QUIETUS
His Statement That He Did
Not Implicate Wittman*
Relieves the Situation
There was complete rest yesterday
in the investigation of police condi
tions in Chinatown. The emphatic de
nial of Sergeant Ellis that he ever
charged before the Grand Jury or any
one else that Chief Wittman pave him
instructions not to molest the fantan
or lottery games has put a quietus on
the sensational affair. While it is be
lieved that the Police Committee of
the Grand Jury is at work on pertain
facts in connection with corruption in
the Chinese quarter, it is thought that
it has not got much farther with the
probe than has been done several times
before. ,
"I am taking: a rest over Christmas,"
said Foreman T. P. Andrews yester
day, "and the other, jurors are doing
likewise. We* will give no attention to
Grand Jury matters until Tuesday. I
have told the stenographer and the po
licemen detailed to assist us and to
serve subpenas that they .need not re
port until Tuesday morning. I will not
say whether we are encouraged or dis
couraged over the situation as to the
investigation of the Chinatown ' cor
ruption. Anyhow, we shall not give a
further thought to the matter until
Christmas is over.'.' . 3

HOW TAX MAY
BE RETURNED
City Attorney Long Advises
an Amendment by Legis
lature to Afford Relief
SPECIAL LEVY INVOLVED
Will |Giv| Three Years for
Claims for Moneys Paid
for Hospitals and Schools
City Attorney Long yesterday gave
the Supervisors an opinion on the ques
tion whether the Board has the power
to refund the taxes illegally collected
for the new school houses and a county
hospital where the same were paid
without protest and demand was not
made "or suit begun within the time
prescribed by law. Mr. Long's opinion
says the right to recover without ac
tion or protest must be regarded as a
statutory right, the enforcement of
which may be permitted within three
years from its inception, but he ad
vises the submission of an amendment
to the Legislature designed to extend
the limitation contained in section 3804
of the Political Code?" Long submits a
form of the proposed amendment,
which is in effect an enabling act,
and provides that any taxes erroneous
ly collected shall be refunded upon a
verified claim therefor filed within
three years after the making of the
payment sought to be refunded.
The City Attorney quotes from the
code to show that. those taxpayers who
have not filed written protests and
have not begun action within six
months from the date o{ payment can
not recover the taxes paid, however
unlawful may have been their exaction,
and that the proper procedure to re
turn the taxes is by amending the code
as already stated.
The extension of the time limit from
six months to three years would permit
of the return of the special fifteen levy,
as the taxes *>*vere paid in November,
1902 and April, 1903.
Chew Bins; Quota's Estate.
The belated inventory of the estate
of Chew Bing Quoia, the deceased Chi
nese labor contractor, was filed in the
Probate Court yesterday. It is stated
that $9200 was withdrawn by the
Chinaman from his business before his
death, and this, with other funds mak
ing an aggregate of $.13,800, was de
posited with Louis Shuck at 715 Sac
ramento street. There is a question
as to whether or not this money be
longs to the estate, and a suit has
been instituted against Shuck.

Branstetter of Ferndale are in the city.
Early In the Senatorial campaign there
was a deal of political gossip to the ef
fect that the Humboldt delegation in
the Legislature, under the leadership of
Mr. Selvage, would support Henry T.
Oxnard for the United States Senate,
but the subsequent candidacy of George
A. Knight, who began his political ca
reer in that county, caused a readjust
ment of the programme and it is now
admitted that Mr. Knight will get the
support of the Humboldt statesmen. In
the Senatorial contest of 1899. when
General W. H. L. Barnes, U. S. Grant
and D. M. Burns were the leading can
didates, George A. Knight had the sup
port of the Humboldt delegation on
several ballots, but on a dark night in
January one of the northern chickens
"flew de coop" of Mr. Knight and land
ed in Mr! Grant's house. The flight
caused considerable merriment and
hastened the dissolution of the Knight
forces.
It is understood that Mr. Oxnard Is
Senator Selvage's second choice in this
campaign and would be his first choice
were It not for- the Instructions which
the Humboldt : convention gave when
the ticket was nominated. There is
conjecture concerning the third. choice
of Senator Selvage. Some aver that
Senator Bard Is In line for that distinc
tion, while others contend x that the
honor Is reserved for Frank P. Flint of
Los Angeles. It . is common talk that
the Humboldt delegation will scatter,
every man going as he pleases, when
Knight elects to retire, from the field.
The Assemblymen will surely go their
own way without consulting the State
Senator.
Stories are published in the Demo
cratic newspapers to the effect that
Senator Greenwell of Santa Barbara,
Assemblyman Drew of Fresno and As
semblyman Prescott of San Bernardino
will not vote for Senator Bard. In the
Bard camp this is the reply: "Wait un
til the Legislature ballots for Senator.'*
The lawyers have not succeeded in
"rushing" Governor Pardee In the mat

He Is taking his own time to consider
the merit, availibillty, and geographical
position of the applicants. The consti
tutional, amendment creating the new
courts defines the districts and requires
that more' than one political party shall
be recognized in the selection of Judges.
The San Francisco Assembly delega
tion will organize by the election Â»of

In darkness. The practical joke -had
been worked several times ere the storÂ«

they had a policeman specially detailed
to catch the marksmen, -with the re
sult that Masters Burdldc and Rogers
were nabbed as they were peppering
away at the big white bulb. Judge
Mogun pronounced Master Burdlck
guilty of malicious mischief and re
manded him for sentence, and Master
Rogers' ball of 510 was forfeited and a
bench warrant issued for his capture.
Mrs. Mary Schomberg's vituperative
volley at a couple of policemen was not
the sole cause of her being sentenced
to four months' Imprisonment by Judge
Mogan, for her previous bad character,
as reflected by several convictions for
disorderly conduct, was taken into con
sideration when the penalty waa fixed.
It was at Eighth and Howard streets
that. Mrs. Schomberg vociferously ex
pressed her opinion of the police force
within hearing of two of its members.
They had warned her to refrain from
disturbing the peace and she responded
by disturbing It.

Mr. Lavelle by request of Mr. Hunter,

told Judge Conlan, : "an' even. if he did

â  The report is very lengthy, and pre
sents: an enormous amount of details.
It provides for confining the Sacra

tween: lines of levees built sufficiently
far apart to hold the flood .^waters,
with the purpose in .view, of forcing
the contracted current to scour: out. a
sufficient depth to enable the Sacra
mento River to carry its own flood
volume. The estimate of the cost as
"given in the report is $20. 674. 802. To
this 15 per -cent, or $3,101,220, is
added for administration and contin
gencies, making the total cost $23,
766,022.
The estimate is given by the engin
eers as the maximum cost and they
point out that if less : dredging Is re
quired the expense will be consider
ably reduced. 1 The engineers do not
discuss the ways by which the money
to carry on the work shall be raised,;
leaving that to be determined by the
Legislature and the Federal Govern

time, over the Mayor's veto, It was
provided that the appointment should

by the police to be the slayer of Police

After watching the man for a few

GRADUAL PASSING AWAY
OF THE LIGHTNING ROD
Out of Favor, Though Still Credited
With Some Slight
Value.
Lightning rods have fallen into deep
disfavor almost everywhere nowadays,
.but they are valued least by the hasty
'pt'ople who once valued them most,
â¢and those who really know the most
about them still credit them with a
measurable, though small, amount of
'protective power- â if properly con
structed and maintained, as they hard
ly ever are. For those who consider
even a slight diminution of the dan
ger of lightning worth securing at
some expense in money and a good
deal of care, the Weather Bureau of

Professor W. S. Franklin of Lehigh
University.
The lirst desideratum is what the
electricians call a "good ground" â that
is, clo.Â«c and permanent connection with
a large mass of high electrical conduc
tivity, like damp soil or an extensive
cystc-m of metallic pipes. The lightning
rod itt=elf should be a wide band, a thin
v.ailed tube or a wire cable, rather than
a stolid wire, tor go is the conductivity
of a given amount of metal largely in
creased. And of extreme importance
is it that the course of the rod to the
ETound should be as short and straight
as possible. If ihe pathway provided
for the "bolt" be devious the Impatient

while if the path be straight the Insula

Lord Minto's Hoodoo.
It is said that Lady MInto, the wife
of the late Governor General of Can
ada, believes that the position her hus
band occupied is hoodooed. During the
first three years there were many ex
citing incidents and several accidents,
but the last was rather too full of ex
traordinary and dangerous . events.
Here is a list: Lord and Lady Mlnto
were taking their farewell of the coun
try where they have been so popular,
and the train in which they were trav
eling collided with another, with the
result that five passengers were killed
and many injured. The viceregal
parly escaped only because their car
riage happened to be the last. In 1900
Lord Minto took an active part In fight
ing the fire at Ottawa and risked his
life several times. In 1902 he narrowly
escaped drowning through the breaking
'of the ice bridge over the St. Lawrence.
Early in the present year Lady Mlnto
was unfortunate enough to break her
leg while Bkating, and before she was
able to move a fire broke out in the
Government House, from which she
had to be rescued on a stretcher.
Life of Locomotives.
In this country the general method is
to run a locomotive for a limited num
ber of years, and then to relegate it to
the scrap heap" In favor of a more mod
ern type of engine. On the other aide,
however, the practice is to -retain a
locomotive in* service as long as it" will
run, irrespective of the developments
and improvements that may be incor
porated in the progress of time. The
result is that upon the English rail
roads may be seen engines still in hard
use which we should consider long past
their term of service. Yet no English
-engine has attained the unique distinc
tion achieved by â¢ the locomotive No.

SANITARY HOUSING
FOR WORKING PEOPLE
What Is Being; Done in Germany In
That Most Needful
Direction.
According to United States Commer
cial Agent Harris at Eibenstock, a
great deal is being done in Germany
fcr the benefit of the working people,
especially in the matter of providing
them with suitable dwellings. Large
manufacturing establishments, munici
pal bodies, charitable organizations and
private-" speculators, Mr. Harris saya,
have each and all done much toward
bettering the hygienic conditions and
general welfare of the skilled workman
and his family in every part of the em
pire, j Since 1842, the Prussian Govern
ment has expended about $2,000,000 in
dwelling houses for the coal miners in
the district of Saarbrucken and the, mi
ners repay the loan by monthly install
ments' without . interest. . \
Similar methods were adppted with
success by. the royal munition factory
at Spandau. The building societies of
Gladbach, Barmen, Dresden and other
cities of the empire have also proved
successful In that respect. The Krupp
establishment at Essen takes the lead
In providing comfortable houses and
cottages for the laboring classes. In
1901 the value of the dwellings used
exclusively by its workmen was
$8,875,000. There were 1600 houses
of two rooms each, 1869 houses of
three rooms each, 448 houses of four
rooms each, 150 houses of five rooms
each, 63 houses of six rooms each and
84 houses of seven rooms each, mak
ing a total of 4274 houses. During the
past ten years a great improvement
has taken place in the conditions sur
rounding the dwellings of laborers and
the Increased attention on the part of
municipal authorities to sanitary ar
rangements .and the police laws
against too many persons occupying
one room. Commercial Agent Harris

NEW YORK. Dec. 25.â The World
has a ;long story to the effect that a
renewal of an old charge is to *be
pressed- against Episcopal .Bishop Tal
bbt of ' Central Pennsylvania. The
charge was made in the triennial gen
eral convention of the Protestant Epis
copal Church ! In San Francisco two
years ago. Briefly, it was to the effect
that Rev. Ingraham N. W. Irvine had
been forced from his pulpit in St.
Paul's Church in Huntingdon, Pa., by
Bishop Talbot, in order ! to please - a
woman arid, gratify, her spite.
Irvine's charge' fell- through.; Now
powerful supporters have, been rallied
to his aid and there is to be a com
plete Investigation . that will be sensa
tional in the extreme.
The; Bisho'p* wrote an Indiscreet con
fidential letter denouncing Irvine as a
mdrister of vice. 'This letter is now
part.af the presentment against Bishop
Talbot. It not only charges Bishop
Talbot with,, conspiracy^ with : a .woman

of a dishonorable use of the names of

SUBWAY AIR SHOULD BE
PUMPED OUT,- SAYS YERKES
â  â¢
London : Underground Railway Mag-
nate Tells of Ventilation
. in That City.
Charles T. Yerkes, the Chicago capi
talist and financier, who returned re
cently from Germany on the overdue
liner Kaiser Wllhelm der Grosse, had
something to say about subways, sub
way air, and subway signs, which is
of interest to New Yorkers. Mr. Yerkes
is at the head of the companies which
are constructing two new London un
derground railways and the company
which is electricity as the
motor power for the two old "tubes." 1
"The British people," said he, "have
been traveling underground for thlrty
five years. Their trains, have been
hauled by steam locomotives - which'
used coal for fuel. The ventilation is
poor, and the air to me Is extremely
noxious. . Londoners, however, don't
seem to mind it. In fact, they are rath
er proud of it, and say that the 'tube'
atmosphere Is a sure cure; for hay fe
ver. At present we- are changing the
motive power of the two old subways
from steam to electricity, When we
have finished, the bad smell will quick
ly disappear."
"In the tube line of the Central Lon
don Company a system of ventilation
was not provided forâ they thought the
motion of trains would .push out the
air and bring about a contaant change
of atmosphere. This system is all right
as far as light gases are concerned, but
carbon dioxide, the worst of the poison
ous gases, is heavy, and remains in the
tunnels. They have had to rig up a
gigantic ' air pump, and every night
they pump out the foul air. ,- . - -,
"We have hit upon a new scheme,
and have put in ventilators at every
statibn. Each night the bad air Is
drawn out, Just as it is in well-regulat
ed mines.. I think that is the way to
do in all subway's. We have also elimi
nated all inflammable material from
our subwaysâ the cars, platforms,
roadbed, Â«ven the signs, are of metaj
or asbestos. j There is nothing that- will
burn in the equipment of the railro/d
or tunnels." f
When told of the .heated discussion
which is being waged Qver^he pres
ence of advertising signs fin' the New
York subway,. Mr. Yerkes seemed sur
prised. ;â  r :
"Advertising signs, when used judi
ciously, are all right," said he. "In
fact, there is one very strong point in
their favorâ they relieve the monot
ony of otherwise bare walls. In Lon
don there is no objection to their use
and in Paris they are really a feature
of all public placesâ largely ' because â 
of their artistic excellence. There the
best illustrators make advertising
posters." â -New York Commercial.

they were victims of his trickery.

"This. woman who calls herself Flem

of her home at White Sulphur Springs
never owned the property in question,
and furthermore her name is not Flem
ing, but is Mrs. Henry. She purchased
a lot of furniture .and some other per
sonal property from Mr. Taylor, the
proprietor of the springs, and got a
lease on the hotel there.
"Mrs. Henry failed to make the place
pay and advertised the furniture for
sale. I answered the advertisement,
and, after arranging the terms of .the
sale, I took over the lease and pur
chased, the .furniture. While she was In
charge of the springs Mrs. Henry, or
Fleming, mortgaged the furniture, and
I 'also assumed ' this mortgage. . I also
failed to make the place payi and later
the furniture was taken by Mr. Perry,

was myself and not "Mrs. Fleming who
lost the property.

Wears It Until Arrested
George Williams, a negro, was ar
rested last night by Detectives Mc-
Gcfwan and Conlan and Policeman Joy
and will be required to face many
charges of burglary. He has made a
practice of boarding vessels tied up* at
wharves, robbing sailors' rooms. When
captured last night he was wearing a
portion of the wearing apparel belong
ing to. Edward Vander linden, a. Belgian
count, who is an apprentice on the
British ship Lynton. The property of
men of other ships completed his ward
robe.
Early yesterday morning Williams
was detected in the act of robbing a
stateroom on the German ship Europa
by the watchman, Albert Osberry. He
started to make his "escape and was
running across the deck when the
watchman called upon him to halt.^ In
stead of complying Williams drew a
revolver and . pointed it at . the sailor.
The latter, being unarmed, permitted
him to escape, but was In a good posi
tion to get an accurate description of
the thief.
For the past couple of weeks reports
havVcome in from the British ships
Eva Montgomery and Lynton and the
German ship Europa that thieves had
visited them. The thefta on the Eva
Montgomery consisted of jewelry and
clothing worth about $200; on the Lyn
ton clothing worth $300 and on the'Eu
ropa clothing worth $100. Three sep
arate robberies were committed on the
Europa. On each occasion the negro
was seen, but gave as an excuse for
his presence' that he was either looking
for a job or was seeking a friend.' '.It
was not until early yesterday morning
that Detectives McGowan and Conlan
became satisfied that Williams was the
man who was wanted. â  > *
When searched at the City Prison
Williams was wearing -the," cbat of the
Belgian count, the overcoat of another
sailor on the Lynton, the hat -of a Ger
man sailor, and he was stocked with a
supply :of handkerchiefs on which 'were
stamped the names of j seamen i robbed.'
The watchman . on the Europa, who
was repulsed with the pistol, was called
to the prison by the detectives and
without hesitation pointed out Williams
as the man who had threatened him.
Several of the stolen suits of clothes
have been recovered.: .Williams V will
have : several charges of burglary-en
tered against his name on Monday.
Accused of Embezzlement
"William Fluegler, a. 'collector, was

that Fluegler embezzled $185 from the
American Biscuit Company, money
that he had collected and 'was sup

of the 'firm.' Though $T8E is 'given as
the- specific amount, it is said that

which has - developed into a mania
probably the most remarkable brain
kink possessed by any man in the
United States, and one of the most
costly.
Up to date Mr. Taylor's collection of
monuments has cost over $60,000, and
plans already perfected carry the
amount of his expenditures in sight
to over $100,000. And he does- not pro
pose to stop until he has exhausted
his fortune, reserving, only a sufficient
amount .to see that his beloved monu
ments are'kept In good condition after
he has been called to his fathers.
The scene of Ms operations is in the
old Lafayette burying ground, adjoin
ing Birmingham Meeting House, of
revolutionary fame, about five miles
from West Chester.
Mr. Taylor began his monument
building years ago. His wife lay
buried in the ancient cemetery, and
after the erection oÂ£ a handsome trib
ute to hor memory', he started to beau
tify the place generally, planning fig
ures to mark historical events. In some
of which his ancestors participated, to
gether with others commemorating
matters and "figures of biblical lore.
â¢ But his plans were not to be exe
cuted without a determined struggle.
Trustees . of the cemetery looked
askance at the dazzling marbles, and
the costly figures . in the heretofore
plain old burying ground and finally
he was stopped in his work by order
of the board. â¢ â¢ -
CONTROLS THE CEMETERY.
Mr. Taylor, however, had no Intention
of abandoning his cherished idea. He
saw that, as matters stood, he could bo
no further, so he bided his time, worked
quietly and said little.
In 1891, to the surprise of the board
of trustees, he secured enough stock' to
give him control of the cemetery com
pany, and at the election succeeded In
ousting the "anti-tombstoners" and
electing a board whose ideas were In
harmony with his own. .
The election contest was waged with
extreme bitterness, and every man and
woman who owned a lot In the ceme
tery was importuned to turn out.
It was â¢ a complete victory for the
monument builder and he was chosen
president of the new board. The "antl
tombstoners" were .routed and shortly
after Mr." Taylor took up his monument
plans in earnest and he has since made
the old burying ground famous
throughout the . country. Mr. Taylor
says he will provide for the protection. I
of his monuments for 100 years after he
Is, dead, and those who know the char
acter'of the man have no doubt that he
will" make his word good. ' His whole
heart and soul' appears to be wrapped'
up in the ancient burying ground and
he will devote his entire fortune to it.
The conventional towering pillars
surmounted by statues or the low
stones on which are reclininff lambs are
not satisfactory to Mr. Taylor, and his
collection of monuments indicates that
he has his own Ideas as to designs and
the Independence of mind to refuse to
have them Interfered with by any rule
of cutters of gravestones. He appears
to-be especially fond of statuary, as
there are several places in his monu
ments. All of these figures are carvel
In marble by a celebrated sculptor at
Carrara, Italy, and then shipped to this
country.
IHS FAMILY LOT.
At the head of his private lot. where
in lie the remains of his father, mother,
wife and other relatives, he has erected
an imposing shaft on the top of which,
in a graceful kneeling pose. Is a.life
size statue of his wife Jn white marble,
while at the foot, stand white marble
statues of the Savior, the Virgin Mary
and St. Joseph.
All of these statues have biblical in
scriptions; they are incased in glass
to protect them from the elements.- and
are among the most beautiful, speci
mens of statuary art In the country.
Mr. " Taylor' 8 family lot is close to
the main entrance to the " cemetery.
Near the gateway is a massive granite
monument, about twelve feet In height,
surmounted by a large ball, erected to
the memory of the monument, builder's
great-grandfather, Colonel Isaac Tay
lor, who was a member of General
Anthony Wayne's staff.
ALL READY FOR HIMSELF.
In the family burial lot there is
but one space left for the dead, and
this has been reserved by Mr. Taylor
for> himself. He has had his grave dug.
walled and cemented, and when . his
time .comes all that will be necessary
will be the raising of a heavy granite
slab and lowered the coffin to the place
prepared for It..
1 A few yards distant stands the Im
posing shaft erected to the memory of
General Lafayette. It is built of srran
ite.on a pyramid base, and stands
forty-five feet high. It Is Mr. Taylor's
purpose eventually to cap it with a
bronze statue of the distinguished
Frenchman. At the foot of the shaft
there are places at the four corners of
the capstone for .the busts of four
French .officers who participated in the
battle of Brandywine. Their names
and the dates of their birth are chiseled
thus in the granite:
General Lafayette, born September 6,
1757; died May 2, 1834.
Caesimer Count Pulaskl, born 1747;
died 1791. at sea.
General Count Jean Rochambeau.
born 1725: died 1807, in France.
General Marquis St. Simons, born
1760: died 1S25, in France. â¢
There are other inscriptions upon the
tablets, including General Lafayette's
toast at a banquet in West Chester.
July 26, 1825.- :
MAD ANTHONY'S' MEMORY.
It is likely that the next monument
to be erected by "Mr. Taylor will be one
td the memory of "Mad" Anthony
Wayne. There Is already built a mam
moth pedestal' for the statues of Count
Pulaekl and Daniel Wells and Henry
McComas. .The latter two were killed
at the battle of North Point. Consid
erable material Is now on the site for
the completion of the canopy, and
when It Is In readiness, the three stat
ues will be brought from Italy and
placed in their positions on this base.

PRINTING DONE
IN PHILIPPINES
Large Number of Natives Are
Employed as Typesetters
and Pressmen by Uncle Sam
SOON BECOME EXPERTS
Operate Linotype Machines
in One of the Most Modern
Offices in Whole World
An interesting statement, descriptive
of the Government printing office at
Manila and of the Filipino typoa em
ployed there by Uncle -Sam, was made
to-day to a Star reporter by Arthur
j P. Ferl, a recent employe of that far
away institution, but who is now set
ting type In the Government printing
office in this city:
"The Government printing offlca at
Manila," said Mr. Ferl, "employs near-
Jy 300 people, fifty of whom are Ameri
cans, the balance being Tagalogs, VI
sayans. Bicols, Igorotes and represent
atives from various other tribes from
one end of the archipelago to the other.
It Is no uncommon. thing to find two or
three boys working side by lid* who
cannot converse in their native tongu*
and these generally resort to Spanish,
which nearly all understand. They are
nearly all students and readily acquire
a knowledge of the .English language*.
The employes of this office axe required
to attend night school* so that now
every native who has been In the office
any length of time speaks English.
"It should be borne In mind that the
Manila printing office Is one of the most
modern Institutions In the world, hav
ing all the latest and most Improved
machinery for printing, folding, bind
ing, electrotyplng, photo-engraving,
etc.'- Many of the machines would
puzzle an American unless he was up
to-date and yet the natives are han
dling all these machines with such suc
cess that very few of tha American
employes are required to do more than
oversee the work.
NATIVE STAFF.
"In the 'front office* may be seen na
tive clerks, bookkeepers, stenographers
and typewriters and messengers. The
work In the proofroom Is done by
Americans with lady copyholders and a
few native readers and copyholders,
who handle the dialects and most of
the Spanish. In the composing room
there is an American foreman, two or
three linotype operators and several
others in such positions as makeup,
Imposer, etc., all of whom are 'instruc
tors,' while the fifty or more natives in
the room 'do the work.* Here may be
seen a native operating a double-deck
Mergenthaler with such ease and com
fort as would make an anti-machine
man's eyes pop out of his head, and,
while the average native cares even
less than we do for hard work, they
take to the machine as if they were
made for each other. â¢ , . -
LINOTYPE OPERATORS.
"Of the twelve linotype machines In
the office ten are operated by our lit
tle brown brothers and with very fair
success. All Job work and blank work
Is done by natives. The copy must ba
carefully prepared, of course, and as
everything Is printed In English and
Spanish on the same sheet this is quite
a task. About the same proportion of
printers make good job printers as is
found among the Americans. - â¢ â¢
"There is an American Printers*
Union in Manila, to which the natives
do not belong, but they have a society
among themselves which takes the
place of a union, as evidenced by an
incident that happened about a year
ago. We were very busy In tha office,
and did not propose to recognize a cer
tain church holiday, so a number of the
employes (natives) sent a note to the
Public Printer, which, while it waa
hardly English, meant: 'We under
stand that we have to work to-morrow,
but as it Is a holiday we do not intend
to do so." And they didn't.
LONG FINGER-N'AILS.
"All Filipinos who do no work have
three long fingernailsâ the thumb and
fore finger on the left hand, which th*
printers use as tweezers, and the little
finger on the right hand.
"It looks quite picturesque to see X0O
or 300 natives coming to work in thÂ«
morning, ail dressed in white; but go
through the building fifteen minutes
after the whistle blows and what do we
see? The white suits have disappeared
and we behold a motley collection of
skinny brown arms and bony legs clad
in a scanty suit of underwear.
"While the office hours In the Manila
office are from 8 to 12 a. m. and 2 to
5 p. m., which would seem easy enough
for any one, it Is hard to keep the na
tive at work. He must take a rest
of two or three days every few weeks,
and on this account It is almost im
possible to put a native in any position
where there is any responsibility or
where he has charge of a number- of
men. When they, want to stay away
from the office they are required, to
furnish an excuse, and I recall one
man In particular who buried seven
children, his no:her and father and
several brothers and sisters In ona
year. They are like a lot of children
and have to be treated as such."â

HOW ins DAYS GO.
When the weather is good he is accus
tomed to spend all his time at his
graveyard. He will go out In the morn-
Ing, day after day, and linger by the
sides of his monuments until the shades
of evening drive him away. The place
has become a Mecca for the public, and
hundreds of people, come from far and
near to view his expensive collection
of marble and granite. He ha3 made a
provision that when he shuffles oft
this mortal coil his body shall be frozen
hard and that there shall be no speak
ing at either the house or the grave.
He has already selected hla pallbearers.
A plain headstone will mark his own
grave; it has been selected and is all
ready for use.

FROST BEGINS
Methods Employed in Fmncc
to Give Notice of Approach
of Much Dreaded Enemy
-MOVABLE SMUDGE GOOD
In Some Districts Artificial
Showers Are Produced to
Protect Endangered Crops
In his battle with the frost th
farmer must have news of the coming
cf the frost and many means for giv
ing warnlns have been employed. In
France frost bells are sounded when
a. frost Is expected and grape grow
ers protect their crops by pouring tar
on the ground among the vines and
setting it on fire. The smoke thus
made often saves the crop of an en
tire vineyard, a. fact of interest to
Americans, who are good customers of
the French grape growers, as is showa
by the demand for the cold bottle lo
accompany the hot bird.
In America there are districts
where It was formerly a practice to
maintain a regular messenger ser
vice that the weather bureau's predic
tions of frost might be promptly car
ried to farmers and fruit growers. To
day there are many places where,
"*-hen frost is predicted, the whistle
Â«n a factory in a village sends forth
notes of warning over the farming
country for miles around. In other
localities the news is given by tlags
placed where they can be seen at con
siderable distances.
More important than these aids to
the weather bureau, however, are the
rural free delivery, the telegraph and
the telephone. The telephone in many
regions is rapidly supplanting other
agencies and the officials of the Bell
telephone companies tell many stories
cf the way in which the news of the
coming of the frost is spread broad
cast. In 1903 nearly 30.000 villages
end farms received daily forecasts by
telephone and nearly S000 had ar
rangements for receiving special
earnings of frost and sudden storm.
In that single year the number of
place* receiving forecasts by tele
phone Increased by nearlv 20,000.
MOVABLE SMIDGK IS USED.
The farmer has a choice of several
.agencies in protecting his crops from
frost. Should a stranger in the coun
try district see at night the glow of
smoky fires mounted on carts and
drawn around a' field or orchard it
would be erroneous for the visitor to
Infer that the farmers were using
these perambulating bonfires for pur
poses of celebration. As a matter of
â fart, the movenble smudge is one of
the devices for repelling the advance
of the legions of General Jack Frost.
The purpose of the smudge is to
â create a smoke which hangs like a
cloud a i.'hcrt distance above the sur
face of the earth and imprisons the
heat, which would otherwise be radi
ated through the upper air. Smudges, '
both of the kind which are hauled
from place to place and those which
ere stationary, are used in the fruit
orchards of California, and other Pacific
Coast States, in the orange groves of
Florida and in the wheat fields of
the Dakotas.
While the smudge is used for the
purpose of creating a cloud of smoke
above the surface of the earth and im
prisoning the heat which .would other
wise be lost by radiation, fires of a
different kind are employed to actually
raise the temperature in an orchard.
Several years ago experiments were
tried in California in which oil was
used as fuel. It made a hot fire and
was neither expensive nor difficult to
manage, but as it covered the trees
and fruit with lampblack the system
â¢WKs not regarded as of great value.
Small coal fires, on the other hand,
give excellent results and in the orange
groves of California sometimes fifty of
them are started in a single acre. This
costs about J4 a night, but as the
oranges maturing en the trees In that
one patch of ground may be worth $400
the money spent for the coal fires is
really very cheap insurar'.^e.
spkixk ling i:fficacious.
Another of the methods employed to
avert the danger from frosts may be
described as the artificial shower. The
story of how this is used on one Cali
fcrnia ranch is told in a United States
Government publication. Did it come
from a less reliable source the man
who -lives in a city and knows little
about farming and fruit raising might
put it in the class with the stories told
by the returning trout fisherman.
The owner of this ranch caused to be
erected on it a number of masts, fifty
feet high. At the top of c-ach mast was
fastened a sprinkling device, through
which water could be forced. On nights
when the temperature sinks to the
frost point the pumps begin to work,
the sprinklers commence to sprinkle
and the air is filled with a fine spray,
which eo charges it with moisture that
in nearly every instance the protection
given the ripening fruit has been
sufficient.
The ov.r.er of a little patch of gar
den and a panlen hose, if he will get
up Just before sunrise on a frosty
morning may save his precious vege
tables by sprinkling them. He !s doing
in a small way what the ranchman In
California accomplishes by the use of
the fifty-foot mast with the sprinkler
at its tor-. v
For the protn-tion of large fields and
orchards another elaborate scheme has
been used with more or less success.
This consists in extending to different
ITirtP of the area to be protected pipes
vhirh are connected with a steam
ooiler, steam bthjg generated on frosty
night? Rnd distributed by the pipes to
the places where it will do ths most
food
SWAMP tiASDS FLOODED. '
Water is extensively employed in
fighting frosts in the cranberry dis
tricts of New Jersey, Wisconsin. Cape
Cod and other portions of New Eng
land and the upper lake districts.
When there Is likely to be a frost the
Kwamp or bog lands tn. which this crop
Is confined are flooded by means of
appliances by which neighboring bod
ie* of water can be drawn upon. The
â¢vater covering the cranberry patches
keep the lower Ftratum of air compara

date and March 12 thirty official visits
have been scheduled. The following
are the visits to the local groves: Jan

a letter to Supreme Arch Martinoni
of this city, announces that all the*
groves in the East aTe doing well and
that a new grove to work in the Eng
lish language is being organized in
New York City, being the second. It
is probable that one to work in the
Italian and one to work in the French
language will soon be organized in
that city.
Orders have been placed for the

one at Salinas and then the one at
Isleton. At each place there was work
in the initiatory degree and the.mem
bers manifested considerable interest
in the affairs of tfie order. At Isleton
the visiting officer exemplified' all the
work of the order in a very interest
ing and comprehensive manner. At
each place there was hospitality in the
form of a banquet. â¢ .
Capitol Circle of the Druidesses, or
ganized by Jennie S. Clark of Sacra
mento in that city, with fifty char
ter members, speaks well for the
lady's ability as an organizer. The cir
cle was instituted by Grand Arch
Druidess Olga Heiden. assisted by
Grand Secretary Augusta Thornhill.
The institution of the new circle and
the installation of the officers were
followed by a banquet- The organizer,
who was chosen past arch Druidess of
the circle, expects to increase the
membership to - 100 within three
months.
McKinley Grove, under the 'direc

Winter Vegetables ft New Industry.
A new and rapidly growing agricul
tural industry in California is the pro
duction of winter vegetables for the
Eastern markets. Already s we are
shipping large quantities of asparagus,
cabbages,- caulitlowers, radishes, let
tuce, potatoes and the more hardy
vegetables that can be grown during
the cold months of our winter season.
This is one of the most promising out
looks for agriculture in California at
the present time. We have in J this
State an unrivaled climate, one that
very much resembles the spring of
the Eastern States, and in which all
the vegetables which grow In that
part of the country during that sea
son will thrive during the months
that Eastern farms and gardens are
under enow and In the embrace of
the ice kin*. To overcome the differ
ence of climate in the larger Eastern
cities numerous greenhouses have
been located covered with glass and
heated by artificial means, and theso
have been found enormously profltaÂ»
ble. Hundreds of acres in New York
and Chicago are thus placed under
glass for the cultivation of winter
vegetables, such as we can produce in
the open every month in the year.
With more rapid means of transpor
tation and low freight rates, by
means of careful packing and hand
ling, there is no reason why the East
ern States should not offer a profit
able market for enormous quantities
of vegetables grown In California dur
ing the winter months. We may not
hope for the fancy prices paid for the
glass-grown vegetables, but there Is
a large body of consumers able and
willing to pay good prices for fresh
vegetables during the .months that
they cannot produce them In the East,
and it is this class we should be able
to reach with profit to ourselves.
Southern California has gone very

Freak of the Wind.
â  Almost beyond- belief, is the story
which comes from England of a trick
the wind played not long ago on the
spire of a Presbyterian : . church. It
blew the steeple above the belfry . 25
degrees out of plumb, so that the spire
pointed In a .northwesterly direction
and It was feared that it .would ' fall.
When the next morning men were en
gaged in straightening it the wind
veered around and blew it back to
its original position. Of course, ; it
was necessary, for the men to stength
en it and Its supports, but th'e wind's
freak made their, work much easier.â

SEARCHING FOR
OLD FURNITURE
Mr. Amateur Must Be Careful
in Selection, as Imitation
Closely Resembles Genuine
GOOD WAYS OF TELLKsG
Desirable Articles of Earlier
Days Fast Becoming Scarce
While Bogus Ones Abound
The taste for old cMna, silver and
furniture has almost developed into a
passion of late years. It has sud
denly become the fashion to have cu
rios of all kinds in the home furnish
ings. Therefore, as a demand always
creates a supply, there are to be found
on the market hundreds of masterly
imitations of the work of the great ar
tists in furniture. Some of these imi
tations are open and above board re
productions of the antique, but others
are such successful imitations of an
cient furniture that it is necessary to
be very wide awake if one meditates
purchasing specimens of the old crafts
man's art.
The coarse and rough Imitations that
are seen in second-rate shops every day
never dectlve the searcher after the
antique, but really first-class work may
easily impose upon. even the elect, and
reasonably so, when It becomes knc-A-n
that there are skilled workmen who
make a business of imitating worm
holes in modern furniture before It
proudly blossoms . forth to become the
Joy of the inno-cent amateur collector
of the antique.
It is usually at this time of the year
that the housewife is seized ' with the
spirit c-f refurnishing her home or add
ing by way of adornment a few new
pieces. If the antique is her special
choice the following suggestions may
be of interest. The modest buyer is
alone being considered, she who would
spend at the very most a hundred or
so 'dollars on a cabinet, table or desk.
There Is a kind of sham too popular
nowadays â and of all shams it is the
most dangerousâ to buy old wood, pos
sibly of drawers or panels of cup
boards, and mingle. the old and new to
the confusion of the uninitiated.
Sometimes dealers have the .honesty
to say that goods of this description
are made up articles, and often these
pieces are quite worth adding to one's
collection because" the wood in their
construction is well" seasoned and the
grain fine and exquisitely colored.
LOOK INSIDE.
When a cabinet is the object under
consideration it is well to open' the
drawers and inspect the lining. \ If the
article is genuine they .will be lined
with oak or elm, but if a modern im
posture the lining will be merely plain,
stained deal. Other evidences of the
real thing are the weight and the
doweling, which in old furniture is pe
culiarly done. But all these signs fail
when the genius of perfect deception is
abroad. One simple thing to notice" Is
the state of the polish. It should be
put on perfectly smooth, and the var
nish should not seem to be carelessly
run into the corners. Another evidence
is that, the edges -are comparatively
soft and rounded .by wear and not
shnrp or clearly cut. x
In spite of the widespread interest
and knowledge in furniture and deco
rative art generaly there is a great
confusion of ideas as regards styles.
Just in the same way that some collec
tors of- antiques persuade themselves
that because a thing is old It must
necessarily be beautiful,- so there are
those who think that to conform to a
certain style is slavish and lacking, in
originality. To such people a French
style immediately conjured up bow
knots, garlands and gilding, while we
know that this expression of art can
exist without any of these and still be
tnje in character. What style in house
furnishings should really be taken ,t<Â»
mean is character, appropriateness
and an acceptance of those rules
which the experience of centuries has
proved the best, yet allowing 1 scope for
individual requirements.
KEKP TO THE STYLE.
The collector of antiques should
also bear in mind that a piece of fur
niture must never be selected irre
spective of the differences in its style
â that is. when a single .'apartment
is to be furnished â for if jumbled In
a heterogeneous' mass the result will
be no more satisfactory than a col
lection of pieces in a furniture shop.
There is no character, no originality;
only a motley collection of things.
The skillful artist knows well that
in. decorating and furnishing a house
harmony of color and form is the first
essential, and the collector of the an-,
tique should have her wa.lls decorat
ed with regard to the furniture for
which they are to form a background.
Could anything be more absurdly
grotesque than the placing of a piece
of French art'in-a room decorated in
Dutch style? Still, decorative errors,
perhaps of a less glaring nature, are
met with on every hand and in homes
of culture, more's the pity! The
French style of . furnishing will be
very popular this winter, my lady
needing this setting, for: her Louis
XVI and Henri II gowns. An especial
prize" in French examples is the Boule
furniture, which is particularly happy
in its cabinet specimens. Andre
Charles Doule was the cabinet maker
or ebonist to Louis XVI, and the'flrst
and most characteristic work connect
ed with the style, of "le grand mon
arque" Is known as Boule. The Boule
is an elaborate kind of marquetry. In
laid with, tortoise .shell, brass, ivory
and ebony, the origin of which can be
traced to Indian, Persian and Damas
cus incrusted inlays. Examples of
Boule work are now very valuable and
command high prices when they are
offered for sale. t
FOR MODEST TASTES.
The. Inlaid Dutch furniture resem
bles somewhat the Boule. but is quite
within the bounds of the modest an
tique purchaser's sphere. The rich
and bright colors of different woods
ore used In the marquetry and the de
sign Is usually. that of some pictur
esque foliage mingled with tulips,
roses and birds. In addition .to wood,
other materials," such as -Ivory and
mother-of-pearl, are employed. This
Dutch furniture was Introduced into
England during the reign of William
and; Mary, and has descended to us in
the simpler and later phase known as
Queen Anne. ', This seeming confusion
of names was brought about by the
practice of. using the names of. royal
ty to denote styles both* In furniture
and; architecture as supplying â¢ more
convenient dates than the beginning
and end of. a century. â¢
The quaint .and simple Queen Anne
furniture . Is a curious blending of
Dutch and French-influences.* The In
lay Is of- Dutch adoption, and the ca
briole leg Is an entirely French feature.

- GETTING SCARCE.""
â¢ Chippendale, Hepplewaite, Sheraton
and Adams are all specimens of furni
ture very much sought after now,
cither as originals or in reproductions.
Sheraton sideboards and bookcases are
beautiful with the . swan pediments
and quaint dlamond-paned effects in
the doors.
The fad of the moment is for old
door knockers, and if a woman is seen
rushing frcm one antique shop to an
other you may be sure she has this fad
and is on the chase. Really old door
knockers are scarce. They are being
copied. It is true, but the manufac
turers are not able to duplicate the
battered, dented appearance c-f the
knocker that for many years in sun
and rain has stood as sentinel at the
door. An objection . to the modern
knocker is that they are very much of
a pattern, and there is no /impress of
the workman's 6kill and.ln a 1 measure,
of his humor at the time the work was
done. . r'fhe particular pattern the
searcher for old knockers wants is the
lion's. head, which is likely to be found
In the Venetian knocker. There -are
other patterns of flat, plain. brass that
are well liked as a second choice. When
one is riot successful in a search of this
kind an expedient worth knowing is
to- buy a new knocker and bury it in
the ground until- it becomes green and
moldy." After this burial one clever girl
has hit upon the idea of giving the
knocker to her small brother to play
with. She did not tell him what she
hoped to accomplish, but in these war
times It is quite . possible that .the
knocker will go through â¢ many â  mock
battles as some piece of ammunition,
and when it returns to the owner It is
sure to have enough dents to satisfy
the fastidious sister.
When the whole family is enthusi
astic on the subject of antique knock
ers this precious specimen goes on the
front door. There Is a- craze just now
for the individual door knocker which
hangs on the oak of the antique lover's
own domain. Luckless the individual
who gains entrance without using this
coveted piece of antique open sesame!

Strange Little Railway.
- Germany -possesses a miniature but
most useful railway, to which no
parallel is found in this country. Its
peculiarity is that its trains have no
drivers. It is used, for carrying salt
from the salt mines at Stassfurt. The
trains consist of thirty trucks, each
carrying half a ton of salt. . The'en
gines are electric, of twenty- four horse
power each. As It approaches a sta
tion, of which. there are five along the
line, -the train automatically rings a
bell and the station attendant turns a
switch to "receive it.' He is able to
stop it. at any . moment. To start' it
again, he -stands on' the locomotive,
switches the current and then descends
again before the - engine has gained

DAKOTA INDIANS FOLLOW
*J*}~.i EATING AS A TRADE
3Icn Regularly Hired to Assist Guests
at Too Bountiful a
least.
One of the most striking customs of
the past that are preserved by the
Indians of to-day is found among the
tribes on the Devil's Lake Reservation
in North Dakota. â¢ Supervisor Wright of
the Indian service gives the followins
account of this peculiar practice:
"From time immemorial the Devil's
Lake Sioux have adhered to an old cus
tom In regard to the treatment of .the
guest. According to their etiquette it is
the bounden duty of the host to sup
ply his guest v.-ith all the *vod he may
Utsire, and as a rule the apportionment
set before the visiting Indian Is much
In excess of the capacity of a single
man.
â¢"But by the same custom the guest
Is obliged to eat ail that is placed be
fore him, else he . grossly insults his
entertainer. It was found that this
practice would work a hardship, but
instead of dispensing with the custom
the Indian method of reasoning was
applied, and what ia known as the pro
fessional eater waa brought to the
front.
"While the guest is supposed to eat
all that is placed before him. It serves
the same purpose If his neighbor as
sists In devouring the bountiful repast,
the main object being to have the
plate clean when the meal is finished.
"It is not always practicable to de
pend upon a neighbor at table to assi3t
in getting away with a large dinner
and in order* to â¢ insure the final con
sumption of the allotted portion, visit
ing Indians call upon the professional
eaters, whose duty.it is to ait beside
them through a meal and eat what the
guest leaves. The professional eaters
are never looked upon in the light of
guests, but more as traveling com
panions with a particular duty to per
form.
"These eaters receive 'from II to $3
and even %Z for each meal where they
assist. It is stated by the agent at thÂ«
Devil's Lake Reservation that one o2
the professional eaters has been known
to dispose of seventeen pounds of beef
at a 3ltting. That they are capable of
eating an almost fabulous amount I
mysel? can testify."â Chicago Chronicle.

THB CRY
OF FREEDOM .
To our patrons all w* extend Chr!Â»t_a#
greeting: They tare nobly advocated and fur-
thered tha right bf man to llv* and work un-
hindered by closed shop conditions. To-day wi
commemorate tha birth of our Savior, Jesus
Christ Nineteen hundred and four years ago
God gav* the- world, through the Virgin Mary,
â  his only begotten son that man should ltvo be-
side man; that he should love his neighbor as
himself. How far Ban Francisco has fallen
from the divino teachings is better told by _â¢
closed shop and the refusal, for many years
past, of the right of th* American boy to learn
a trade. So much good has been accomplished
toward the opening of th* shops during ths
past twelve months that w* must extend 1 to all
those who stood as th* rocks of Gibraltar at
our back In this great fight doubly tha greet-
ings of the season. The cry of freedom Is
stamped, th* cry of freedom will b* listened
to. Who is tha man. when la the hour, that
our Heavenly Father will call those responsible
to account for their wickedness? Ha is slow,
but he is sure. The handwriting on th* wall
reads as follows: "Th* closed shop must go.
and capital and labor dwell amicably together
and proceed harmoniously in progression hand
in hand." Remember. Jesus wept So does
to-day th* widowed mother and all Christian
parents. Shall San Francisco become another
Sodom and Gomorrah? 'Will the hand of mercy
which has been held out so long to us b*
changed to a hand of destruction?

Good Old Custom.
In Newcastle, England, the Mayor
enjoys the privilege of once a year be
ing allowed to .select and kiss any
young woman who takes his fancy
among the coal city's inhabitants. The
kiss is rather costly, however, for It is
the custom to present the young per
son kissed with a sovereign ($5), while a
further gift is made her by the lady
Mayoress, no doubt to disprove jeal
ousy. The Sheriff, no't to be outdone,
also bestows a kiss upon a fair by
stander, at the same rate of expendi
ture. The occasion is known as Barge
day, when the Mayor and corporation
proceed in a procession of four gayly
decorated steamers and two old stake
barges to claim the soil of the river
Tyne. Their Journey over, the Mayor
stands upon the boundary stone, and It
is here that the kissing is indulged In. â

3Iarylander Grows Seedless Grapes.
George B. Snively, a horticulturist, of
Shady Grove, Washington County, has
succeeded In "producing a seedless
grape. He hopes to be able to grow
the new grape to a large size. Several
years ago he bepaji grafting â  various
varieties of grapes with a definite end
in view and this year one vine, which
is well developed, â¢ has - a number oÂ£
bunches of grapes on it which are
without seeds. The vine also bears
grapes containing seeds, but each year
that the vine has borne fruit the num
ber of seedless bunches has steadily
increased and Mr. Snively believes that
ultimately the grapes will all be with
out seeds. The seedless grapes, while
smaller. In size than the ones contain
ing seeds, are of superior flavor,âBalti
more Sun.
An Independent Dresser.
Countess Cassini, niece of the Russian
Embassador to this country, persistent
ly refuses to adopt the short walking
skirts which have come into a consider
able degree of favor of. late. So far
from taking to the "trotters," as they
are called, the sprightly Russian has
amazed even the ultrafashionable by
the length of her trains and the great
size of her hats. Picture hats worn

slowly at C5@65c. Onions have been very
quiet of late and the principal handlers have
cut the prices In order to dispose of the ac
cumulation.
Offerings of southern vegetables were liberal
and Included the bulk of Friday's belated ar
rivals. Beans, Peas, Tomatoes and Summer

Poultry and Game.
Receipts of Callfornlan dressed Turkeys were
only 40 cases and. aa there was very little
carried-over stock on hand; the market con
tinued firm and thr best lots brought a slight
advance. The market was not excited, how
ever, as the high prices checked the demand
for domestic stock and retailers turned their
attention to Eastern chilled, which was offer
ing freely at reasonable prices. Stocks on
hand at the close consisted of a few odd lots
of poor stock, which would be hard to sell
under the most favorable conditions. Live
Poultry was quiet but steady, there being very
little stock on hand. A car of Western falls
due to-morrow.

general advance In prices of Wild Ducks and

Tfce Butter market broke yesterday. Only
a' fe\f dealers quoted 25c, moat of them quot
ing 23@24c, while one houae offered fine
creamery for delivery early next week at 22c.
ThÂ© reasons for the decline were a marked in
crease In stocks, a very poor- demand ar.d the
general expectation of a . lower market lmme
dlatoly after Christmas. The trade did not
want . to be caught napping, so sold the â¢ goods
at lower prices than those heretofore ruling to
get rid of their surplus stocks. It was a case
of etand from under. , _ . .
Somewhat similar conditions prevailed In
Eggs. They were not as weak as Butter but
a s marked decrease In . the consumption after
; Christmas was , expected. , and . as the â  warmer
and* moister ' weather â  is favorable to'an In
creased production the tendency was to ' sell.

work off their stocks.

Trade was still very quiet, as retailers had
sufficient stock on hand to last over Christmas
and most of them were too busy with Turkeys
to pay much attention to fruits. - 8tocks it
Oranges are heavy and are being added to

ACTIVITY ALONG THE WHARVES
SLOWS DOWN FOR THE HOLIDAYS
Steamship City of
Peking Sails for
Panama. .
PassengersWill Eat
Christmas Dinner
at Sea.
Storm Signals Warn
Mariners of Com
ing Gale.
Christmas cast its shadow along the
valer front yesterday, and under the
*peH of the approaching holiday busi
ness, xvhere It was not standing still,
gnored quietly along the line of strict
necessity. The City of Peking sailed
for Panama, and the idea of going
away from Christmas at home had a
subduing effect on passengers and the
friends who gathered on the wharf to
bid them good-by. The promise of
good cheer at sea was not alluring to
any and no prospect at ail to those
with stomachs unseasoned to the un
"Siisy equilibrium of floating hotels.
Captain Robinson promised fair weath
er arid a. smooth sea, but the weather
jnan's prophecy of a southeaster re
ceived more consideration than the
mariner's optimistic forecast.
In addition to about a score of pas
sengers, the Peking carried S500 tons
of cargo.
The steamer Point Arena, which
â was the first vessel in the harbor to
decorate, went to sea about 4 o'clock
dressed in evergreens from deck to
mastheads.
The Eureka, also decorated, sailed
lor the port after which she was
named. Captain Jessen will be host at
the dinner to be given to-morrow night
to those passengers who are able to
dine in the pitch - and toss of a stift*
north u ester. The City of Puebla clear
ed yesterday, but will not sail until to
morrow.
The Pacific Mall wharf was the only
really- busy place along the water
front! There an army of stevedores
r as Engaged in finishing the loading of
xher Hner Mongolia, which leaves on
Tuesday for the Orient with 15,000 tons
of cargo, mostly contraband, for
Japan. The Mongolia will take alto
gether about 1S.O00 tons of cargo.
Bar Ls Breaking.
The bar celebrated the approach of
Christmas yesterday by stirring itself
into a frothy fur>\ which served notice
W mariners to keep away. The steamer
Santa Cruz, from southern ports, was
unable to cross the breaking waters,
and- .to reach tne Golden Gate had to
make p. wide detour and come in by
way of the north channel. Weather
l>ir-eau signals were set yesterday giv
ing warning of the approach of a
southeaster.
The Overdue List.
The- rates of reinsurance on the two
vessels now on the overdue list remain
unchanged. The Edith Mary, out
niriety-one days from Ascension for St.
Jonas, is Quoted at 70 per cent, and
Â£0 per cent is the rate on the Brier
Ht'lme, out 154 days from London for
Kobaru

HEROISM FAILS
TO SAVE LIFE
Four Members of Engine
No; 12 Brayely Go to the
Rescue of an Aged Man
EFFORTS ALL IN VAIN
Gustave Johnson Is Fatally
Burned in Humble Abode
; on Spear Street Wharf
While hundreds, of men and women
were preparing to leave their places of
business on the Oregon Railway and
Navigation Company's wharf at the
foot of Spear street at 6 o'clock last
evening Gu,stave Johnson, an old and
almost helpless man, was slowly burn
ing almost to a crisp. The unfortunate
man was preparing to go to bed in his
humble room at the rear of his cigar
store on the wharf, when he overturned
a lamp. Instantly; Johnson was envel
oped in a sheet of flame. His cries for
aid were, finally 'heard,' an alarm of fire
was sent in and four members of en
gine 12' hurried -to his assistance. He
was brought . out in a dying condition
and taken to the - Harbor â  Hospital,
where his death is hourly expected.
But for the heroic acts of the four
firemen, Captain, Sullivan and Hosemen
George Wells, George Linnehan .and
H. Carter, the poor ..old man ' would
surely have been. burned beyond recog
nition. .
Fragments of . Johnson's kerosene
lamp were found scattered about the
floor .of his little room, which was
readily filled with the fumes of the
lamp. The old man made a feeble out
cry before he fell unconscious to the
floor, and this undoubtedly saved , him
from instant death.
The firemen broke into the place and
quickly extinguished the flames. John
son was discovered lying- in a heap
near the bed. His clothes had already
burned from his back and his flesh
was so - badly roasted that it peeled
from his body. Captain Sullivan tried
to lift the limp" form of the man in his
arms, but. as soon as he touched the
body tlie flesh came off in chunks.
Hence it was necessary to wrap him
in a blanket.
Thci physicians at the Harbor Hos
pital worked for an hour trying to re
vive Johnson, but finally gave the cafee
up as a hopeless one. , A close exam
ination of the skull revealed a fracture
at. the. base. Jtis supposed that the
unfortunate old man struck his head
against the edge of the bedpost when
he fell helpless to the floor.
Johnson had for years presided over
the humble lfttle cigar stand where he
met his fatal injuries. He was a fa
miliar figure on the Spear-street wharf
and known by nearly all the seafaring
men on the water front. So far as is
known he had no family.
Game Birds Follow Storms.
It is seldom that a* hurricane and
thunderstorm brings in its train a de
luge of game birds, This singular spec
tacle, however, was .witnessed in the
Tarbes district recently. The storm
broke over the district in the evening,
and when the gale was at its height,
about 10 o'clock, large flocks of quail,
whlch^must have been migrating at an
invisible â¢ height^ 'were beaten to the
ground, the plain around being thickly
strewn' with their bodies. -In the
grounds of the Hotel de Paris the birds
were â¢ picked up â¢ in dozens. â London

ROW OVER DOG
CAUSES DEATH
Peculiar / Fatality Follows
Trouble Lodging - House
Man Has With a Stranger
FALL FEACTUEES SKULL
Jacob--' Scheupp. Gives the
Unknown a Shove That
Throws Him to Sidewalk
Jacob. Scheupp, a lodging-house
keeper at 207 Main street, Is under ar
rest on a charge of having caused the
death" of an unknown man yesterday.
In a quarrel over a spitz dog Scheupp
claims that he gave the stranger a
shove, who then fell to the sidewalk,
striking his head. The trouble oc
curred shortly after 5 o'clock last
evening, and the unknown expired at
the Central Emergency Hospital four
hours afterward. His skull was frac
tured. He never regained conscious
ness, and there . was nothing on his
person by which he could be identified.
According to the story told by
Scheupp, the stranger attempted to
steal the dog, and he was. in the act
of intercepting him when the man was
thrown to the sidewalk. Scheupp says
the man had been in the habit of sell
ing vegetables at his lodging-house,
but that he does not know his name.
During the morning hours Mrs.
Scheupp gave the vegetable man one of
a pair of spitz pups, jand he left highly
pleased, but soon after 5 o'clock in the
evening he returned and asked for the
other one. He said that a street car
had killed the first pup and he was very
insistent in his demand that he be
come the possessor of . the other ani
mal. ;
Scheupp says that he refused the
man, and an argument followed. This
occurred in the office of the house, and
for a moment Scheupp's attention was
called to another matter. .When he
turned to resume his conversation with
the â¢ vegetable man he found that the
latter had disappeared and that the
pup had gone with him. Scheupp hur
ried to the sidewalk and caught up
with the thief. The latter had the dog
concealed under his coat. The argu
ment commenced anew, and Scheupp
claims he shoved the man to one side.
Then it was that he fell to the side
walk and fractured his skull. Scheupp
says that the man was very much un
der the influence of liquor at the time.
Parasites Shipped from France.
The first shipment of parasites of
the codlin moth has been received from
George Compere, who is now traveling
in Kurope under instructions from the
State Horticultural Commissioner in
search of this parasite. The shipment
was small, but arrived in good'condi
tion and is now in the hands of the
deputy horticultural commissioner at
San Francisco, where the new insects
will be carefully looked after and bred,
with a view to distributing them
throughout the State during the com
ing season. Mr. Compere found these
Insects In France and Immediately
shipped them to*" California. The in
sect is one of the ichneumon flies, the
whole group of which is beneficial and
lives by preying upon other Insects in
their caterpillar or pupa form, t When
the female of this species locates a
codlin moth larvae, she proceeds to lay
an egg in a non-vital portion of its
body, which, hatching out into a small
grub, soon eats out the body of its
host, after which the parasite passes
through the pupa state and emerges as
a full fledged fly, ready to attack
another codlin moth. Mr. Compere
states that he has found several para
sites which work upon the codlin moth
â In Europe and it is devoutly to be
hoped that among them he may suc
ceed in discovering the true enemy of
this pest and the one that keeps it be
low the danger line in Its native land.
Should this insect prove, all that Mr.
Compere claims for it, it will still be
some' time before it is thoroughly es
tablished and before we can judge
whether it will be as efficient in our
State~as it seems to be in Europe. It
is too often the case that we expect
results Instantly. This cannot be, as
it takes a long time for the parasites
to breed, even if they; breed at the most
rapid rate, and It will be two or three
years before we are able to judge as to
the effectiveness of this new insect.
However, the fact still remains that
something keeps the codlin moth below
the danger line in Europe and it Is not
by any means impossible that if Mr.
Compere has not already discovered
the true parasite, he will before his
work is completed and we shall have a
more effective means of keeping this
pest in check than wenow possess.

Forest Planting Kncournged.
The bureau of forestry of the Agri
cultural Department has made plans
to give practical assistance \ to land
owners in establishing commercial for
est plantations, shelter belts and wind
breaks, â¢ " and in shifting
â sands and other waste lands by forest
planting. The purpose of the bureau
in its co-operation in forest â  planting,
the plan of .which has been In more
or less general use during the last sev
eral years, is to establish in suitable
localities examples of forest plantations
of ; the highest possible usefulness" and
value "to the owners.
After an ; application in forest plant
ing has been made jana accepted an
agent x of the bureau will examine the
land and if practicable" prepare Im
mediately â¢ a planting plan, if the
area is too extensive for this a thorough
and ". exhaustive .-* examination will be
made and a report submitted to the
owner,' who, if he desires, may j have
.the forestry bureau prepare a scientific
and elaborate" ' planting plan, which,
with all essential measurements, maps
and other data, Is sent to him upon
completion. The 'bureau does not in
tend to furnish seeds or trees for plant-
Ing,' leaving this to the owner's own
selection and expenditure. It partici
pates In the expenses of planting only
to the extent of furnishing the services
of its experts. It is believed -that many
American farmers '. and landowners will
take "advantage of the offer : to secure

THE MODERN. AIR BRAKE
GIVES GOOD PROTECTION
How They Are Constructed and How
They Are Applied on
Trains.
Every one has heard of the air brake,
and references to it are sure to be
made when the subject of protection
against railroad accidents is under dis
cussion, but like many inventions in
common use it is more or less of a
mystery, for which an explanation is
demanded from time to time. â¢
. The modern air brake consists of
twelve parts, among which are Uie air
pump, which compresses the air; a
main reservoir, in which the air is
stored; the engineer's brake valve, reg
ulating the flow of air: th"e train pipe,
which connects the brake valve with
the triple valves under each car; the
quick-action triple valve, controlling
the flow of air to and from the auxili
ary reservoir, which is supplied from
the main reservoir, and the brake cy
linder piston rod, which is forced out
ward, thereby applying the brakes.
The theory of the air brake is the
equalization of pressures. When the
brakes are not in action the pressure
on the train pipe is made such as to
prevent an. escape of air from the aux
iliary reservoir. When the engineer
df sires to make an application of
brakes he turns his brake valve so
that there is a moderate reduction of
the pressuVe in the train pipe. This
causes the greater pressure in the
auxiliary reservoir to force air into the
brake cylinder, forefng the piston out
and applying the brakes.
When it is desired to release the
brakes the engineer turns his valve in
the opposite direction, permitting the
air to flow from the main reservoir, lo
cated on the engine, into the train pipe.
When the pressure, thus restored in
the train pipe, is increased above the
pressure in the auxiliary reservoir cer
tain valves arÂ« moved, communication
is thereby restored between train pipe
and auxiliary reservoir,, the piston Is
forced to its normal position, the air
escapes from the brake cylinder and
the auxiliary reservoir is recharged
through the train pipe.
When the train breaks in two or a
hosepipe connection is broken it has the
effect of a sudden and material reduc
tion of the pressure In the train pipe,
the same as though the engineer had
made an emergency application. The
sudden reduction of pressure also' opens
supplementary valves,' which Increase
the pressure upon the brake cylinder
about 20 per cent. The brake shoes are
attached to rods, which are In. turn at
tached to the piston in such a manner
that when the air from the auxiliary
reservoir forces the latter out a pulling
force is exerted upon the brakes.âEx

New Remedy for Celery Blight.
Celery blight, and there has been no
little complaint in the past few years,
can be controlled* by spraying with
ammoniacal carbonate of copper. To
make this dissolve three ounces copper
carbonate in a pint of ammonia and
add twenty-five gallons of water. To
make copper carbonate,, dissolve five
pounds copper sulphate; (blue vitriol)
in five gallons of water, also six pounds
carbonate of soda in five gallons of
water. Mix the two solutions slowly,
stirring well. Let the mixture stand
until .next, day to settle, after which

California as a \tfine Producer.
'California and New Tork axe the
greatest grape growing States in the
Union, and so far as quality is con
cerned It is said the Eastern product
is superior. Quantities of wine are an
nually produced In our State, and rrnich
of it is high grade, but in the trade, as
a rule, the California product is re
garded as cheaper and le$3 meritorious
âwhether this be due to lack of cap
ital or to impatience to put the wine
on the market before it is properly
matured. Some idea of the relative
quality of the output of the two States
can be gained from the statistics as to
quantity and value. New York pro
duces every year about half a million
gallons of wine and California some
two million gallons. And yet the value
of the Eastern output is $3,000,000 while
that of California, with a quantity four
times as great, is only 53,000,000. Our
wine growers should consider this fact
and set about to improve their wine.â

New Things at Fairs.
What on earth wauld our great
grandfathers have said if some one had
told them the county fair would be the
all-embracing "holy show" it is to-day?
When horse pacing and high diving
were accounted regulation features of
these gatherings â¢ it was natural that
the homely things which were the cor
nerstones of the exhibitions should be
lost to sight. But If even twenty-flve
years a so some bold farmer had dared
suggest that the day would come when
automobiles, vehicles not dependent
upon live stock for their means of loco
motion, would constitute the chief at
traction at the county's rallying place
he. would have been declared a traitor
to his calling. Still, that is just what
has con^e tor>ass in Connecticut, where
an automobile parade' has proved the
piece de resistance at one of these fall
fairs.â Boston Transcript.
