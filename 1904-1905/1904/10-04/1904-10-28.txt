ROME, Oct. 27.â Although no request
has been received by the .Italian Gov
ernment regarding the removing of in
ternational restrictions for the passage
of the Dardanelles by ships of war, the
question has been more or less dis
cussed between the powers since last
January, when Great Britain addressed
a protest to Turkey against the passage
of the 6traits by Russian torpedo-boats.
While no conclusion was reached, the
attitude of the different powers appears
to be as follows:
Great Britain is decidedly opposed. '
Germany considers herself an uncon
cerned spectator, whose Interests in the
disputed matter would be neither fur
thered nor prejudiced by whatever so
lution might be reached.
Austria, always upheld the principle
that the Dardanelles should be open to
all or none.
France, because of .her present alli
ance with Russia, views the question in
a different light from that in which she
regarded it at the time of the Crimean
War. when allied with England In the
treaty of 1856, which was confirmed by
the treaty of Berlin, she favored the
prohibition of warships passing the
straits.
Notwithstanding the intimate rela
tions between the houses of Savoy and
Romanoff, the Italian Government has
no reason to change from the attitude
assumed in the Crimean War, in which
Piedmont participated as the ally of
England.
The Italian Anglophile feeling Is
voiced to-night by the Trlbuna, a" lead
ing Government paper, which calls Ad
miral Rojestvensky a ' lunatic, : adding
that If complete and prompt satisfac
tion is not given war will be inevitable.

COLLIDES WITH

Assistant . District Attorney Whiting
was on ?hand to lend the assistance
necessary . if . action should be ' taken
against the Election Commissioners,
and he advised the Grand Jury ./ that
the - law did not require the votes of
twelve members, as in indictment pro
ceedings, to present an accusation for.
removal, from office. A majority vote
would suffice. . he said, and then Fore
man Lillenfeld without further delay
urged, a roll "call. When the result was
announced he insisted that another
vote Â«be taken, but the strident voices
of the opposition were so vigorous in
protest that he gave up the attempt.
: It was reported that Foreman Lillen
feld had been Â¦ approached yesterday
morning in Â¦ an endeavor to have - him
sidetrack the charges against the Elec
tion.Commissioners. His answer was a
stout refusal; He refuses to divulge the
name of the person who, came to hbn,
but * denies I positively 'that it was any
one connected" with the municipal ad
ministration. .The appeal -was of a per
sonal Character, he says.
./The foreman declares that the case of
the 1 commission will be called up again

to'be regarded as evidence. No proof was

regard to the allegations of Juror Neal
on that Assessor Dodge has shown fa
voritism toward' former Mayor Phelan
In the valuation. of his properties.
On every matter before the Jury there
was discord. A number of the members
are of the clamorous type when their
prejudices are touched, and from the
start-oft the lack of harmony manifest
ed itself in the fling of words and the
obstruction to proceedings.
The tryout of the factions in the in
quisitorial body, over which there has
been so much speculation, took place
in the vote. on the case of the Election
Commission, which was the first taken
up. Wakefleld Baker's absence saved
the commission from prosecution. With
out â¢ him Foreman . Lillenfeld failed to.
obtain a majority vote, on which the
District Attorney would have been di
rected Â¦ to proceed against the Election
Board to remove it from office. On a
former occasion Baker sided with those
who urged steps against the Comm|j
sloners, and it was expected that he
would do so again. But urgent business
had called him out of town. Â¦
FACTIONS MUSTER FORCES.
The attempt to prefer a charge of
misfeasance against the Election Com
missioners failed by a vote of nine to

The Grand Jury was after big game
yesterday, but out of a session that was
full of exciting situations and Indus
trious effort to implicate various per
sons in the toils of the law there came
nothing. Lengthy testimony was in
troduced In 'a .variety of matters, but
not in one case was it of the direct sort
that fastens guilt or furnishes a basis
for accusation.
The whole army is delighted at the
appointment of General Kuropatkin as
commander in chief of the land forces
in the Far East. The one idea among
the men is to advance. There is every
indication that when the next fight
commences it will be a desperate one.
Every precaution has been taken by
the Russians to deal generously with
Chinese who have suffered through the
fighting in their territory. Not only
has a special commission been preated
for the purpose of paying for all food
and forage commandeered, but compen
sation is awarded for houses in vil
lages destroyed. This course has as
tonished the natives beyond measure,
and there have been many remarkabla
scenes during the disbursements of the
commission. Chinese who had suffered
by the loss of property fell upon their
knees and thanked the Russian officers
for repayment.
WITH THE RUSSIAN EASTERN
ARMY, Oct. 27.â The heavy firing last
sight and this morning was only the
artillery exchanging shots. Both firing
lines are now facing each other with
out outposts. 4
Suspicious "movements "of ihe Japa
nese have been observed west of the
railroad/ The Chinese say positively
that the Japanese are preparing to turn
the | Russian right or break through a
volnerabie point of the lines.
There was an artillery fight on the
night of October 26 on the north shore
of the Shakhe River, directly south of
Mukden. The cannonading, which was
heavy, was continued to-day. The Rus
sians are attacking. Should the Japa
nese be successful the fighting it is be
lieved will continue up "to the walls of
Mukden. This morning occasional shots
were heard on the western front.
The weather has again cleared and is
much better for active operations. The
days are warm and gunny, but the
nights are cold, and some of the Rus
sian troops, whose winter overcoats
have not arrived, are suffering from the
MUKDEN*. Oct. 27.â There was a re
connaissance in force last night by the
Russian western flank, and desultory
flrlng continued till 2 o'clock this morn
ing. The Japanese were discovered to
be hurriedly fortifying along the whole
line, but this does not, of course, pre
clude the possibility of an attack by
them.
The artillery firing on the Russian
left, which began yesterday and lasted
during the night, has spread south

According to the story told the expo
sition officials by Abbott, the, inventor,

The details of this invention are, of
course, closely guarded by Abbott. He
is willing to put up; a heavy bond to
carry out his part of the contract,
should the concession be granted.' The
phonograph plays no part in the,inven
tion, for , the music is heard first hand
by the customer. Nor 'will it ; be , nec
essary to stand as close to the; music

PORTLAND, Ore.. Oct. 27.â Music
out of a pipe to be turned on or off like
gas is the plan of a company which
has asked for a concession from the
Lewis and Clark Exposition. The com
pany is represented by F. O. Abbott, a
Seattle attorney, who is now in Balti
more, Md., but who promises on his
return to incorporate a .company for
575,000 and exploit the invention. The
concession at the exposition Is to ad
vertise the scheme. Abbott's proposi
tion is now being seriously considered
by. President Good, who is very favor
ably impressed.

That the fire was of incendiary origin
is the testimony of two private detect
ives. There has been much ill feeling
between the Terminal Company and
some of the residents of the neighbor
hood because the company, desires to
close certain South Brooklyn streets.
Owing to the late hour when the fire
was discovered, it was impossible to
learn anything definite regarding in

spread, according to the reports, that
it was impossible for them. to escape. ,

has applied to the Superior Court for
a judgment declaring the deed he
gave to Henry Fox as security for a
loan of $13,000 a mortgage and not an

named in the document. Hall claims
that when the deed was. made In 1896
it was intended only as security for the
loan, and that as he has paid the in

to pay the principal Fox should be
compelled to surrender it. He says

Franz Bopp has arrived in San
Francisco from Montreal, Canada, to
assume his duties as German Consul
General^ in this "city. " Adolph Rosen
thai, the former Consul General, has
been granted an extended leave *of ab
sence, and-; * the Â¦ supposition is that
Bopp's appointment, now temporary,
will later be made permanent. Bopp
;has had ' more' than twelve years' ex
perience in the. German Consular sys
tem.' For five years he was. German
vice Consul at" Chicago, and for a
year he served in a like capacity in
New York. From there he was trans
ferred to Montreal, Canada, where his
jurisdiction included the entire Domin
ion. He' remained at Montreal -for
over six years and comes to San Fran
cisco direct from there.
During his term of service in Cana
da Bopp has had to contend with some
of the most important problems in the
history of the trade relations" between
Germany and the Dominion. A tariff
war, brought - about;*'; according- to
Bopp's view of the mattery by Cham
berlain's policy, of imperial protection;
has -been â¢ waged with the , result ' jthat
the I Dominion now imposes - a*- surtax
on .goods imported from" Germany.. > :
' In- regard ; to reciprocity/ between .the.

at Hegewisch, leading practically up
to the point when the match was ap
plied, is in . the . hands of ' Corporation
Counsel Tolman. Another sensational,
feature of the case that developed to
day is the discovery that I. N. Perry,
president of : the National Bank of

surance companies no claim for any
portion of the $172,000 insurance carried
on the plant." The evidence given be

Frank Bock, engineer of ' the Chicago
Car and Locomotive 'Works, who also
reports a talk he had with L. H. Bald

Baldwin, according to the evidence,
said that Perry _; had applied for in

the actual value of the plant. The en

him of this and repeatedly warned him
to be on his guard. \ ;

It is predicted that Roosevelt and Bel

Julius Kahn is conducting an enter
prising and effective campaign in the
Fourth District. Yesterday afternoon
at the railroad yards, Fourth and
Berry streets, he spoke to a large
throng of men. In -the evening he
addressed an open air meeting at
Tenth and Harrison'streets, and spoke
to a large audience. Cheers greeted
the nominee at every place. Mr. Kahn
utters no words derogatory to the
Democratic nominee. He : quotes the
records and cites facts showing what
Republican rule has done for the
country in the line of affording em
ployment and living compensation to
the workers. He compares the wages
of to-day with the scant wages paid
when the Democrats held the reins
of Government.
Yesterday the wage workers of the
Western Refinery, through the court
esy of Manager Richard Spreckels,
had the pleasure of meeting and con
versing with the Republican candidate
lor Congress in the Fifth District- Mr.
Hayes, accompanied by H. J. Angels,
fhid a visit to that great manufactory,
and it was late in the day before his
visit ended. Not one of the. eleven
hundred workmen failed to meet and
Fh.ike hands with the \isitor. Many
of them talked with him over the po
litical situation and the outcome,
evincing a great desire to have a-con
tinuance of the present administra
tion. Belief that Roosevelt would be
elected and the Republican majority
in the House increased was expressed.
There was no place in the great
buildings, from cellars to the roofs,
that was not visited, so that every
man had the opportunity to meet, and
did meet, the Advocate of their cause.
Mr. Hayes was much pleased with his
reception and left the place with as
surances of support. It was noted in
the conversation of the men after
ward 1 that the fear of hard times fol
lowing a change of administration is
one of the strong incentives to keep
Republicans in line and to bring all
others into the ranks. The business
depression of 1893 and the ensuing
misery of the laboring classes has had
Its effect. A repetition of such a pe
riod is not desired.

F1TTH DISTRICT.
The prospects of a great Republican
triumph in California are bright and
growing brighter, yet the campaign
managers are keeping In mind the dan
ger of overconfidence. The assurances
of success in every Congressional dis
trict in the State have not" caused the
committee to diminish effort. The work
in behalf of the nominees is pressed
with vigor.just as It would be pressed
if even' district were doubtful.
During the closing week of the con
test an army of able Republican speak
ers will visit the Democratic strong
holds with a view of enlisting the sup
port of farmers, workmen and business
men generally in the caufie of protec
tion to the products of California. The
remark was made at party headquar
ters yesterday: "We propose to carry
the war into the Democratic camp. We
are ready to send our nominees to
every place and proclaim our principles
in every precinct. Counties hitherto
Democratic will be in the Republican
column on the 8th of November."
RALLIES IX THE CITY.
Second District, was. in 5an Francisco
a few hours yesterday, having Just re
turned from a remarkable tour of Men
docino and, Lake counties,; where he
broke all records for fast 'traveling by
day and night. Vast audiences assem
bled to cheer him and listen to his-mas
terly discussion .of living topics. . He
will speak to-night at Fair Oaks. To
morrow night the Republicans of Glenn
County will give a great demonstration
in his honor at Willows. The State Cen :
tral Committee is assured of Republi
can gains in Lake . and Mendocino.
Round Valley is reported all right." All
that was needed to put I voters in line
for Roosevelt and McKinlay.. was the
publication of. the complete. text of the
Round Valley bill which Congressman
Bell attempted to pass during the clos
ing hours of the last session. The
speakers clearly presented the fact that
the bill which the Democratic paper of
Ukiah published was not the bill which
Belltried to ring up. The text of the
suppressed bill provoked surprise and
indignation.
Reports are coming to the State com
mittee from Sacramento that the Dem
ocrats are trying to save Bell by cir
culating the . report that the canteen
at the State Soldiers' Home was not
closed down, but was simply placed on
a footing with the canteen of the na
tional homes. The State committee
promptly gives out the correct informa
tion that It is not lawful under the pro
visions of the Bell amendment to sell a
drink of the purest California wine or
even a glass of beer on the State Home
grounds. The canteen at the National
Home, Santa Monica, is in full Wast.
The prohibition in this State applies
only to the home situated in the dis
trict which Bell in 1902 was elected to
represent. The prohlbition,press praises
Bell for wiping out twenty saloons with
one stroke of legislation... ,
The Prohibition State. Central Com
mittee announces a meeting at Acad
emy of Sciences . Hall,*, San Francisco,
this evening. Rev. A.- C. Bane will be
the chief speaker. He will speak on the
topic, "Why the Saloons Should Be
Eliminated." The , final ~ grand rally of
the Prohibitionists of San Francisco,
Oakland, Alameda and Berkeley will
take place Friday, November 4.
A brilliant torchlight parade, headed
by the Roosevelt Republican Legion
and a brass band, marched through the
principal streets and escorted the
guests of honor to the hall. The meet
ing was presided over -by Alfred Hol
man, editor and publisher of the Sac
ramento Record-Union, who read
a letter from Judge Albert ' G.
Burnett of Santa Rosa express T
ing his regrets that sickness
prevented him from speaking in behalf
of Duncan E. McKinlay, who, he de
clared, deserved the vote of every Re
publican in the district and, If elected,
would- make the best representative
this district ever sent to Washington. .
Senator Perkins was warmly ap
plauded when he arose to speak. He
said that all good citizens should have
one object in view, namely: to secure
for the country, good laws and good
government. The party that we should
be interested in, he said, should be the
party that does the most good. The
people of. this country have tried both
parties. In 1893 a Democratic President
was elected/ and hard times followed.
The people /ound they had made a mis
take and. when the Republicans came
into power again, In 1897," prosperity
followed. Senator Perkins then took
up the issues of the campaign and in
an eloquent address plainly pointed out
the strength of the Republican policy. . .
E. Myron Wolfe made an effective
appeal' for the Republican candidates
and . especially for Duncan E. â¢ McKin
lay, the Republican ' nominee for Con
gressman from this district.- ,
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 27.â The Re
publican demonstration that greeted
United States Senator George C. Per
kins In this city to-night indicates that
the Republican majority in Sacramento
County on November 8 will be over
whelming. Fcrr the third time in this
campaign the spacious hall of the Old
Pavilion was filled to overflowing with
enthusiastic Republican voters, who
cheered themselves hoarse when the
names' of Roosevelt and Fairbanks or
of Congressional Candidate Duncan E.
McKinlay were mentioned by the
speakers. Senator George C. Perkins
arid E. Myron Wolfe, State Insurance
Commissioner, were the principal
speakers at the meeting. _ â¢

Dr. Charles P. Craig has returned
from the St. Elizabeth General Hos
pital for the Insane at Washington,
where he had safely delivered the pa
tients he took from here. Only one
subject gave him trouble. That was
ex-Pugilist Hall, a private in the I*.
t antry. Hall was taken with attacks*
of epilepsy in the Philippines, which
resulted in a mild form of insanity.
Possessed of great muscular po,wer he
was doubly strong when laboring un

â¢ "the case grows out of a delay of
about six weeks' duration In the ship
ment of a consignment of 200 tons of
lead which the trading company had
Bold to the Japanese Government, bud-
Ject to the conditions that there should
be no excessive delay, in its delivery.
It was carried from New York to Ta
coma, Wash., by the Northern Pacific
Company, but after it bad been loaded
on a connecting steamer, a United
States revenue collector refused to Is
sue clearance papers to the vessel with
the lead, on the ground that it was con
traband. Delay ensued and when the
lead reached' its destination the war
had closed. Consequently, Japan re
fused to receive the consignment at the
agreed price and the trading company
was compelled to accept $11,000 instead
of $38,000, the price first agreed on.
The company also asks an award of
damages equal to the - difference, and
the case turns on the question as to
whether the shipment was properly
prohibited and, if bo, whether the rail
road company was responsible for the
prohibition. The trial court decided
the case in favor of the railroad com
pany, but that decision was reversed
by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit. .
The case was presented by C. W.
Bunn of St. Paul, general counsel for
the Northern Pacific, and F. B. Jen

A suit to enjoin the city from ac
cepting the forty Standard voting
machines contracted for in July was
commenced yesterday afternoon and
bears the earmarks of having been in
stigated in the interests of an opposi
tion machine. The plaintiff is E. T.
Harvey, member of a firm of : manu
facturers' agents. The attorneys are
Reid & Nusbaumer. Harvey puts
himself forward as a taxpayer bent
upon saving the city from paying $650
each for the forty machines. The de
fendants are the Election Commis
sioners, the Board - of Supervisors,
Mayor Schmitz, Registrar of Voters
George P. Adams* and the United
States Standard Voting Machine Com
pany of New York. '
,-.i The attorneys first . called upon
Judge Lawlor with a request for a
temporary restraining orders They
.were referred to Judge Sloss, who de
nied ' the ; application , on the , ground
that a restraining order should not is
sue upon a complaint based upon "in
formation and belief." The Judge
also said that" the: taxpayer could not
beMnterested in . preventing the ac
ceptance of the machines so long as
they were : not paid for.
The complaint- not only, asked that
the acceptance be enjoined, but that
the officials be prohibited, fronv paying
anything to the manufacturers.- It was
alleged that the Standard machines tio
not comply with' the contract nor, with
the State ; voting i machine law in '. four
specified ; particulars. i '^, ,

The first address of today's ses
sion was made by C. B. Boothe of Los
Angeles, Cal., chairman of the Board of
the National Irrigation Association, on
"The Responsibility of the New .West
to. the Nation." Boothe said in part:
The people of the whole country are only
just beginning to realize the truth that â¢ in
many of the Western States and Territories
there is a vast amount of arid national domain
which, though dry and unproductive, has a
soil of fabulous richners an-*, if Irrigated would
become a eouroe of untold . wealth. In many,
places it was known to be Impossible to re
claim thesa lands by bringing water upon
them, and the desert land act was passed by
Congress with the avowed object of making
them ' productive and adapting them ' to the
homes of settlers who would go upon them.'
The fact is now realized by the most Intelli
gent leaders of the nation that this law has
proved to be a failure in its operation and
ought to be repealed without delay.
The greatness of the West, of its oppor
tunities, of- its -privileges, ought to- make,"
and has made, strong, sturdy. Intelligent, hope
ful and enterprising men. You can fln<* : in
the reclaimed arid lands communities that
will Â¦ bear favorable comparison wltlf any. of
the Union. I ask the leaders and the> people
of the West if such an empire, with such po
tentialities, 1Â« not worthy of their high
est endeavor and most patriotic devotion?
In all this commendable effort for river im
provement It must be borne in mind that the
consequent increased prosperity of this great
Western country will benefit not only the peo
ple of tho present day, I but also the genera
tions to come, even as the people of Holland
and In the Valley of the Po are now sharing
in the benefits of work Inaugurated centuries
ago.
are fully alive to the situation and are ready
to put fortii their concentrated energies to fol
low out the comprehensive pian that will be
devised by the commlPFion of engineers, laying
asldfr individual and local prejudices, an it is
generally conceded that in no other way can
the improvement of rivers and the reclamation
of lands be successfully carried out.
It is gratifying to know that the people of
California and especially those more directly
Interested In the improvement of these rivers,
The river improvement in California now
inaugurated iÂ» the outcome of a convention
held in San Francisco irv May last that was
prompted by the heavy floods in the San Joa
quin and Sacramento valleys during the
months of March and April preceding â floods
that caused damage estimated at several mil
lion dollars. This convention was attended
by mere than four hundred delegates and ad
dresses were made by many prominent men
upon the subject of reclamation, river improve
ment and drainage. As a result of this con
vention there was formed the River Improve
ment and Drainage Association of California.
A commission of engineers was appointed,
made up of some of the moct prominent men in
the profession, who had had wide experience in
dealing with river problems. This commission
has been at work in California for some time,
and is now about completing Its labors. It Is
anticipated that the report of this commission
will point out a way to Improve and control
the rivers of- California, so that the danger
from floods will be averted, the rivers made
available for navigation and a van area of
land reclaimed.
That part of the San Joaquin Valley lying
along the lower San Joaquin River is termed
the Holland of America for the reason that this
vast area of land, which Va6 formerly covereJ
with tide water, and on whoee deeper chan
nels ocean vessels plied In the early days
of California, has been reclaimed by means
of dykes and canals following methods similar
to those employed in Holland. A peculiar fea
ture of this territory la that the land level,
in many cases. Is from fifteen to twenty fest
below the surface of the canalF. This land
is as fertile as any in the world. Results
achieved from agricultural pursuits in this
region are in many cares almost incredible.

ST. LOUIS, Oct. 27.â The beginning
of to-day's session of the Trans-Mlssls
cfppi Commercial Congress was de
voted to a general discussion of the
topics presented in the papers read
during yesterday's session. President
Kerens, in a brief address, admonished
the delegates that the congress was
not accomplishing all the work In
tended by merely listening to papers,
but that the delegates should discuss
the different subjects placed before the
congress and bring out all the potent
points. Necessarily the general re
view was limited, owing to the number
<tt papers yet to be heard, but was
earnest and animated, embracing irri
gation methods, cultivation of sugar
beets, the commercial aspect of the
country, labor and capital conditions,
government, protection against floods
and kindred topics.
One of the most interesting addresses
of the day was that delivered by Rufus
P. Jennings of San Francisco, execu
tive officer of the California Promotion
Committee. Jennings spoke on rivers
and irrigation. He first reviewed the
history of river reclamation as eeen
along the Nile and In Italy. Taking up
the problems which face the West he
cpoke as follows:
There has been much accomplished in the
tVeÂ«t In the way of river Improvement as
Â¦.Cectlng navigation and in the attendant bene
fitnrÂ«Â«ulttng' from reclamation and irrigation.
llaxy project! for further work are under way. ,
Notable irrigation has been accomplished
from the Jord.-.n River in Utah. This work
wae llrrt begun as early as 1850, and has
meant to the State of Utah the production
of * valley aa fertile and beautiful as any in
the Rocky Mountain region. The Snake River
Valley offers possibilities of great develop
ment for Idaho. The area drained directly by
this rivpr covers thirteen thousand square
miles. Under the provisions of the reclama
tion, act sixteen hundred miles of preliminary
surveys for canals and reservoirs have been
irade acd work Is now being energetically
pushed. The value of land in this district,
bated on its products, is very high.
In Nevada also the work of reclaiming land
has advanced to a point where construction
hÂ£Â» already begun. Canals will be built, with
diverting dams, to convey fourteen hundred
cubic feet of water per second from the
Truck** River to Irrigable land* in the Truckee
and Carscn valleys.
In Arizona there are vast drainage basins
In the Gila Valley and in the Salt River
Valley. The Tonto reservoir In the Salt River
Valley, it is said, will be the largest ever
Â«*c nrtr-jctfd and will supply water sufficient
t-i irrigate 250,000 acres of land. The Gov
ernment has thij: work now well under way.
I.-rttration and river improvement are being
liH-k^-d tnto by the United States Government
ia Colorado. Surveys have been made in the
Crand Car.ycn of the Gunnieon River. In
this connection it is proposed to divert the
Â«Â»tfrF of this river by means of a tunnel

The builuing ci jetties In the Willamette

Â¦everal large projects are being investigated
by the Government to divert the waters of
rivers in that i?tÂ£.tÂ» in crdrr to provide irri
patlon for certain districts where the rainfall

the Government on the Upper Colombia and
Brake rivers In Orejron and Washington, the
remits of which indicate favorably for the
extension of river commerce into fertile agri
cultural country- These surveys include one
hundred and twenty-five miles of the Columbia
River from Olilo. Or., to the mouth of the
Boaka River !n Washington and two hundred
acd twenty-one miles up the Snake River.
The -Government haj gone tÂ« great expense
iti the lmr'rovÂ£rn < ?nt of the Columbia River.
Vettels drawing twenty-threÂ«Â» feet of water
ascend the Columbia for a distasce of more
than one hundred miles. In the Upper Colum
bia channels have been dredged, rocks blasted
ar.d looks and canais have been constructed.
Up to Jjine. 1903. almost four million dollars
had been expended in building a canal and
necessary locks around the Cascade rapids of
the Columbia in Oregon.
PROBLEM IX CALIFORNIA.
In California the water problem, as is well
known. faÂ«* always been prominently to the.
front. It is cratifying to be able to state that !
thlÂ«> problem is being rapidly solved. When
it Is cortFldfred that California hss a coast
line- from north to south of about twelve
hundred mile*, and a lotel ana of >5S,360
square mileÂ«. It is not strange that
Â£iversiAed conditions as regards water supply
exist there. One peculiar fact about Callfor-
Bia iÂ« that the climatic conditions from the
extreme northern to the southern parts of the
Â£tate are very similar, with the exception that
In the northern oart there is at times and in
certain localities more water than I the peopl*
know what to do with and In the southern
part there 1* frequently less than is desired.
The problem now confronting the people of
California is the control and conservation of
ita river waters mhere there is an oversupply
of Â«ucb. and thÂ» obtaining of water in suf
ficient quantities In other section* of the State.
Irrigation is taking care of the latter prob
lem. The wonderful results accomplished I la
the southern part of California by irrigation
are well known. .What was once a., desert is
row a fruitful garden. The work of Irri
gation, made possible by the Colorado River,
bas within four years put seveoty-flve thou
sand acres of barren deeert under cultiva
ticn. River improvements, together with irri
gation, will provide for the control and con
servation of surplus water.
REGULATING 7 THE RIVERS.
A plan is now being perfected to improve
and control the Sacramento and San Joaquin
rivers, whose flood waters have caused great
devastation. This Improvement will make
available approximately one million acres of
as rich soil as there is In the world and at the
one time facilitate navigation on two Im
portant waterways that letd directly Into the
jrreat Â«>eapoTt of San Francisco. A large por
tion of the country directly tributary, to the
Ban Joaquin River has already been reclaimed
and the river la under control.. the principal
danger at present being â¢ that arising from
floods from the Sacramento, which, waters not

t Robert D. Duke, who was formerly
Tiffany's attorney, was subpenaedrbut
he .refused to divulge professional con
fidences.. Tiffany was called before
the jury and asked to allow the lawyer
to give testimony concerning all mat
ters connected with the theater. Tire
manager consented and | Duke was
again' placed on the stand. He said
that Tiffany, told him that Ruef had
"stood him up" for 50 per cent of the
stock in the theater, and that 45 per
cent was a compromise. The witness
advised him strongly not to submit to
the exaction, but .Tiffany's reply was:
"Oh, I am satisfied I will have to do
something for them, and I may as
well do it now." The manager had
further explained that the, Board of
Public Works was interrupting the
Manager Tiffany was called, but he
only reiterated his former statements,
to the : effect that he .sought out Ruef
to sell the stoek-.to him, for -the reason
that he thought the. . attorney would
make a good j business partner, v
hardt .was, also recalled. -He: admitted
that cwheni he* did^ notf receive ~: the* 666
shares that- he expected and^gbt' only
146, he made complaint to Tiffany. The
manager's explanation was that that
was the best he could do for the wit
ness. : v : :-.".' " '-. Â¦ . '
The Result was that Tiffany gave
Ruef 45 per cent of the stock., The
manager had said he was compelled
to yield this up, when he explained
that he could let Leake and Leonhardt
have only small Interests. Realizing
that the enterprise .would be defeated
because of Ruef's personal hostility to
the witness, Leake sold his shares and
severed his connection with the com
pany. 'In the light of recent develop
ments, he told^the jury, he was glad
to be out of the corporation.
One of the jurors asked Leake if he
had. any charges tv make against Ruef
and the witness answered that -he had
none. He furthermore denied having
instigated the investigation by the
Grand. Jury. Â¦ . Â¦ Â¦ . :^%v";
TIFFANY MADE THE DEAL.
The witness 'explained'-, thai*' he' went
to Los Angeles to negotiate Â«wlth
Baldwin "for the lease* of the theater, it
having been agreed that he should have
a third interest in the business for per
forming this service. His partners were
W. Z. , Tiffany and Charles Leonhardt
Jr. The place was being fitted up when
work was' stopped by order of the
Board of Public Works. Tiffany, who
was manager, complained that he could
make no headway toward getting fav
orable consideration from the Works
Department, the building of the audi
torium and stage being stepped three
times, and finally the witness advised
him to see Ruef about it. The ques
tion of obtaining a permit for theÂ«place
also presented difficulties.
Tiffany went to see the lawyer and
returned with the statement that Ruef
wanted a half interest in the show
house to take hold of the matter. Tif
fany saw the attorney a second time to
ascertain if he would not accept a cash
consideration."": But the manager.came
back/ to Leake with the explanation
that Ruef said he preferred to have the
stock and, furthermore, demanded that
Leake be- forced out of the company.
It was in no harmonious mood that
the investigation was resumed of the
charges that Abe Ruef. "shook. down"
the corporation owning, "the Baldwin
vaudeville showhouse for 798 shares of
its stock. W:-S. Leake, who was. one
of the promoters of the place of amuse
ment, had been relied on as the most
important witness, but it developed
that he had had no dealings with the
intimate friend of the Mayor. Leake
could tell nothing of the alleged use of
influence by Ruef with the Board" of
Public Works that had not been told
him by a third person." :
at the meeting of the jury next Thurs
day, and he hopes then to i have ' a | ma
jority of the members with him." It
looks,' however, as if it will devolve
upon the ".. Merchants', Association to
prosecute the Commissioners if they are
to be prosecuted. The '. association has
announced that it would do so if ' the
efforts of the jurors were not success
ful. ' -
W. S. LEAKE TESTIFIES. .
FORM- BUCKET BRIGADE
The discussion waxed warm between
Dodge and Nealon, but the former had
mcch the better of the argument.
Where Nealon complained that Phelan
had enjoyed a reduction of 40 per cent.
Dodge showed that the grand juror's
properties had been ' given like reduc
tions. -
Assessor Dodge came before the jury
armed with a chart- showing the rise
and fall of assessment of the Phelan
building since 1881. He said sthat
twenty-three years ,ago the building
was erected at a cost of $420,000. â¢ The
present valuation foV taxes is | $220,000.
When Nealon was Assessor, 1 from> 1SS7
to 1&91, he arbitrarily raised the as
sessment from $265,000* to 5350,000. His
successor reduced the figure to $300,000,
at- which Dodge allowed it to stand for
several , years. He did not disturb the
valuation until this year, when he re
duced it -to $220,000, which is 52 per
cent of the original cost.- The present
basis is. to make the valuation for tax
purposes on new buildings 50 per cent
of the cost of construction. Dodge ex
plained that ,his policy is â¢ to reduce
the | assessment , on buildings and in
crease it on land, the object being to
encourage improvements.
The hour of 4 o'clock had been passed
and in the anteroo:.. were ex-Mayor
Phelan, Assessor Washington Dodge,
Robert McElroy and Charles W. Fay,
who Â¦ some years ago - was Phelan's
secretary, waiting to be examined in
an investigation of charges preferred
by Grand Juror James CNealon. that
the former Mayor was enjoying . un
warranted advantage in the assess
ment of his properties. Nealon had
taken none of his fellow jurors into
his confidence and they- were some
what opposed to his proceeding. Nor
was the attitude of; his colleagues
changed much at the time of adjourn
ment, in fact, the jurors refused to
hear Charles TV. Fay, who Nealon in
sisted should be called to testify. .
Phelan told the jurors that he had
never made an application for reduc
tion of his assessment. He; gave the
valuations of the Phelan buildings on
the gore of Market and O'Farrell
streets for several years back, : but
'Nealon plied him with questions con
cerning other holdings concerning
which the former Mayor could hot re
call figures.
.This was as far as the Grand Jury
got with Levy; It was said by one of
the jurors last * night that there
would be no further investigation of
either the Ruef or the Levy matter,
his reason being that there was.no
evidence on which to make out a case.
Herbert Schmitz, president of; the
Board of Public Works, was not called
yesterday, owing to lack of time.
PHELAN BEFORE JURY.
But. the deal fell through, for when
the papers were : about to be signed
John Sroufe died. So at the. present
time Levy â¢ holds no interest whatever
in the saloon.
Levy admitted to the jurors - that
Tiffany had' offered him a half interest
that" "was to be paid for out of the^re
ceipts of the business.". Asked to ex
plain what could have induced Tif
fany "to make so liberal a business
proposition the . secretary answered
that he believed his personal popular
ity was the principal consideration. It
was expected' to draw a big trade to
the saloon. .... : . .Â¦ :
WANTED LEVY'S INFLUENCE.
This 'closed the testimony in the
Ruef matter and the jury next turned
Its attention toMorris Levy's connec
tion with the saloon adjoining the
theater and owned by .Tiffany and the
estate of his father-in-law, John
Sroufe. Leake testified that Tiffany
had told him he was- going: to give
Levy an interest in the saloon in order.
to pain the favorable consideration of
the Public Works Board, of which
Levy is"secretary. Duke corroborated
this and added that he had \ advised
Tiffany "not to give away his saloon.**
building, and that . he had small hope
of obtaining a permit without the as
sistance of Ruef. '..

The Danish Ministry, was officially in

In the Baltic. A Danish cruiser and a
torpedo-boat watched the vessels so
closely that their approach to the Rus
sian squadron was impossible.
While thus engaged the. Danish tor
pedo-boat Havhesten had a narrow es
cape. The commander of a Russian
battleship mistook the Danish torpedo
boat for an enemy and fired a blank
shot. The quickness of the torpedo
boat in displaying its flag saved | her.
This occurred at night time. When the
captain of the torpedo-boat boarded the

LONDON, Oct. 28.â Notwithstanding
the diplomatic check in consequence of
Admiral Rojestvensky's report, it is
evident that Great Britain is preparing
for the possibility of war. Tremendous
activity is reported from all dock
yards w here vessels under repair are
being made ready for sea, under urgent
orders from the Admiralty.
. At Cardiff it is said that Admiralty
agent* are procuring great quantities
of coal for Gibraltar, Portsmouth,
Malta and other ports and paying high
freights. The Mediterranean fleet Is
hastening in the direction of Gibraltar
and It is announced that the channel
squadron, with decks cleared, will leave
Gibraltar early this morning, the al
leged object being a sham attack on
the rock. The home fleet likewise is
concentrating. In fact, almost the entire
Brltiph navy is pointing in the direc
tion of the Baltic fleet, a portion of
which is expected to sail from Vigo
during the day.
Perhaps the most significant develop
ment is the Cabinet meeting which is
called for noon to-day. While the call
was issued prior to the receipt of
Rojestvensky's report, which changed
the situation considerably and appears
to f lace some of the burden of proof
upon Great Britain, the meeting un

REPORTS SEA BATTLE.
ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 28, 3:10 a.
m.â The" mystery of the trawler, affair,
instead of ,, being cleared by Vice Ad
miral Rojestvensky's report, to-day
appears to be deeper than ever. The
Russian admiral's explanation is hail
ed with the greatest satisfaction at the
Admiralty and elsewhere, but it is felt
that a direct issue has now been raised
between | Great Britain and Russia and
the crisis has entered upon -a more
delicate . stage. Public sentiment in
both , countries doubtless will demand
the most searching investigation to
establish facts and probably, neither
nation will be 'wilftng to accept the re
sult of an ex-parte inquiry by -the
other. The outcome probably will.be a
mixed tribunal of some sort. This at
least is the suggestion of some of the
cooler men here, as it is felt that only
thus could a ! repetition of the Maine
incident be avoided.
Popular : excitement has reached a
pitch unequaled since the beginning of
the war. j Public sympathy and con
fidence . undoubtedly are with Admiral
Rojestvensky and, should Russia
choose to stand upon his version with
out further inquiry there Is no ques
tion that such a course would be popu
lar with the masses,' who would - be
willing to back the Government In the
controversy to the utmost extremity.
It is most unlikely, however, that the
Government .will adopt such a, course.
It is much more j probable that, I after
the first flush of excitement has faded,
a middle way will be found whereby
the facts can be established . and the
national pride of both countries main
tained. , .
ADMIRAL'S EXPLANATION.
Vice Admiral Rojestvensky's ex
planation of the trawler Incident is
fully as sensational as the news of
the firing upon the fishing fleet,
which set all England aflame. He
declares he was attacked in' the
darkness by two torpedo-boats,
which" came up on the squadron from
the direction of the fishing fleet. He
opened fire and believes he sank one
of. the torpedo-boats, the other making
off for cover among the fishermen. As
soon as he noticed the fishermen Ad
miral Rojestvensky ceased firing. He
proceeded on his way without leaving
any, vessel behind and says he believes
the vessel which the fishermen reported
remained on the ', scene for six hours
without offering succor to the drowning
was the other torpedo-boat^ either wait-
Ing for her consort or repairing' dam
age inflicted by the fire- of his ships.
It is stated that torpedo-- bouts at
tacked, the leading Russian ship. They
disregarded the signals ..to keep off
when picked up. by the searchlights and
fire was. opened 'on them/' * v . ' " 'Â«
- Rojestvensky refere 'f to .'and - replies
specifically to the reports in the British
press, showing that he had the press
accounts before him when he wrote his
repcrrt. . Some of his language is sar
castic, especially when speaking of the
appearance of the torpedo-boats from
the ' direction of the ' British fishermen,
conveying an intimation which certain
ly- will arouse resentment in England.
He declares that no other, naval com
mander at sea under similar, circum
stances would have failed to open fire
and adds that he courts the fullest in
quiry and suggests that a court of in
quiry could be held at Vigo.
TALLIES WITH FIRST STORY.
It is pointed out that, the original
version of the incident, as recited by
the captain of â¢ the trawler | Moulmein,
coincides closely with s Rojestvensky's.
The captain said that while the.squad
ron was passing he suddenly noticed
two - torpedo-boats, which - approached
so near that he thought that they, in
tended bombarding, him, when they
sheered off, heading back for the
squadron. Almost immediately after
ward .the squadron opened ; fire.
More .Important than any other fea
ture of the admiral's report" is his
statement that there were no torpedo
boats with the Russian fleet. This, in
view of the fact that the captain of the
Moulmein reported. that two .torpedo
boats first approached the. fishing fleet
and then steered for, the Russian war
ships, which' immediately opened flre fc
would -make Rojestvensky's version

CHANGES , THE SITUATION.
' Rojestvensky's report was 'telegraph-'
ed from .Vigo direct to the' Emperor,"
who , received it last ,*" night. It was
communicated' this morning to Embas
sador s Hardinge by : Foreign ' Minister,
Lamsdorff himself . v There is reason to

also acquainted with ;the information/

not aid the victims. Ndw, there was
not a single torpedo-boat near the de
tachment, and none was left behind,
consequently the vessel remaining near
the small steamboats was. that torpedo
boat which was not sunk, but only
damaged. The detachment did not aid
the little steamboats because we sus
pected them. of complicity on account
of their obstinately ; cutting. -into the
order of the- positions of our vessels.
Several of them showed no lights and
others only very late." 1
Second, dispatch â "Having met sev
eral hundred fishing-boats,: the,squad
ron showed them every "consideration,
except when they 'were In company
with foreign, torpedo-boats, ; of which
one disappeared, while the other, ac
cording to the fishers' own* evidence,
remained among, them until morning.
They supposed it was , a Russian and
were indignant because it did not aid
the victims; but it was foreign, and re
mained until morning seeking the other
torpedo-boat; its consort, either to re
pair damage or through fear of be
traying itself to those who were not its
accomplices. If there were also on- the
spot fishermen imprudently dragged
into the enterprise, I beg, in the name
of the whole squadron, to express my
sincere regret to the unfortunate vic
tims of circumstances under which no
warship, even in time of. peace, could
have acted otherwise."
LONDON, Oct. r 27. â One of the
most complicated diplomatic situa
tions in recent history and one that is
attended by the most dangerous pos
sibilities for the peace of the whole
of Europe exists to-night, with no
sign of immediate solution. The ten
sion that arose when the dispute be
tween. Great Britain and Russia re
solved itself Into the simple question
whether Russia would or would not
guarantee In advance that some pun
ishment should be administered to the
offending officers of the Baltic squad
ron has been modified . by the intro
duction of an entirely new set of con
tentions contained in Vice Admiral
Rojestvensky's report; yet even the
most astute diplomats, who recog
nize a temporary Improvement in con
ditions, are puzzled by the complica
tions that so curiously cause it. How
ever, there .is to-night at the embas
sies of the powers not concerned in
the dispute a very strong conviction
that a way out will be found other
than in recourse to war.
The Foreign Office. â¢ apparently as
puzzled as the onlookers, pursues the
policy of silence and the British press
is almost totally uninformed. The
voluminous exchanges daily occurring
between London and St. Petersburg
continue.- the statement that no reply
from Russia has been received adding
to the implication that Russia is ig
noring the British negotiations. It is
this misconception which is chiefly
responsible for the stiffening up of a
popular agitation, - against which the
Government may find it hard to stand
out in "the possible event of Foreign
Minister Lansdowne withdrawing the
demand that Russia guarantee pun
ishment hpfore inquiry is instituted. ;
SITUATION : LESS 17KGENT.
Had Admiral Rojestvensky's report
not arrived it is probable the dispute
would have been settled one way or
the other to-night. Its terms, how
ever, are generally held to prevent
the presentation of the ultimatum
which Great Britain undoubtedly in
tended to send. Although Lord Lans
downe has frankly said that the clr-r
cumstances reported by. Admiral Ro
jestvensky are to him inconceivable,
the Foreign Minister is not prevented
seeing that new light has been thrown
upon the "qutrage" and that diplo
matic usage now compels less urgent
action than the British Government
at first contemplated.
, In the present temper of the Brit
ish nation it is not at all likely that
preparations for hostilities will be re
laxed or that the popular outcry will
be diminished 'by Admiral Rojestven
sky's report,. but it is .understood that
Great Britain .would run- the. risk of
forfeiting in some degree the good will
of .5 France land- certainly that ;of,= Ger
many if she proceeded to substitute
warlike for diplomatic steps, of which
intention, it is said at the Russian em
bassy to-night, there is no indication
in Lord Lansdowne's communication.
ATTITUDE OF FRANCE.
The attitude of France is held to be
of the first importance: It was said
to-day by the representative of another
great power that if France had given
definite assurances that she would not
support Russia In the event of war
growing out of the North Sea incident,
a hostile issue would be almost Inevit
able, as the temptation to crush the
Russian naval power after such prov
ocation could scarcely have been re
fused by Great Britain. It is pointed
out' that it is greatly to France's In
terest to preserve peace, and her ef-
t forts In that direction obviously would
bv strengthened by. not. commltUn?
herself except at the last moment. So
long as Great Britain is not sure
whether France will help Russia, sh?
will not be likely to engage in war;
while Russia, with France neutral.
would, it Is thought at most of the
embassies here, scarcely invite defeat.
The most probable solution of the ru
mors regarding France's position is
said by a high authority to be that
she has* given both disputants to un
derstand that she does not desire to
become involved, but has xeserved her
final decision.
Embassador Cambon was unceas
ingly active throughout the day. not
only In visiting Foreign Minister Lans
downe and Embassador Benckendorff,
but others of his diplomatic colleagues.
HAYASHI'S IMPARTIAL. VIEW.
Baron Hayashi, the Japanese Min
ister, after reading Admiral Rojeat
vensky*s* report, again reiterated hi3
statement that it was impossible that
any Japanese torpedo-boats could have
been where the Russian admiral
thought them. He declared that Ro
jestvensky*s own statement of Indis
criminate firing after such sllaht in
vestigation proved that the Russian
fleet was likely to menace the safety
of all neutral shipping and make in
ternational law merely a farce. War
between England and Russia, Baron
Hayashi frankly admitted. would
greatly be to Japan's advantage; but
yet, as a friend of England, he would
be sorry to see It come, though snch a
war could hardly consist of more than
one naval engagement, the result of
which would be a foregone conclusion.
. Exactly what method can be taken
to investigate Vice Admiral Rojest
vensky*s statements does not clearly
appear. The Russian embassy here
can throw no light upon the alleged
presence of torpedo-boats in the North
Sea, the British Admiralty has no in
formation, and fresh inquiry among
the trawlers elicits no new facts. The
Russian embassy thinks that the fur
ther and more elaborate inquiry i3
proceeding at Vlgo, where the testi
mony of the officers particitpating in
the affair is being minutely recorded.
SPAIN'S â¢ COURSE CORRECT.
2Jo representations have been made
either by the Japanese or by the Brit
ish Government regarding the action
of the Spanish authorities in connec
tion with the Baltic fleet, both Gov
ernments being perfectly satisfied of
the correctness of the Spanish atti
tude.
So far as is known here the United
States is not moving in the present
dispute, statements alleging expres
sions of accord with the British atti
tude on the part of thÂ« United States
being emphatically denied by Charge

WHY APPENDICITIS?
Why is appendicitis so common to-
day?
Because we have got into the per-
nicious habit of eating too fast.

ten follows the .eating of a very hasty,
or particularly, large' or indigestible
meal." , \

big doctor's and surgeon's .bills to pay
eg souvenirs.
Keep your appendix in health by j
the proper use of Stuart'a Dyspepsia

time, this dangerous disease may lay
you low.
The curative influence of this great
medicine is quickly shown in the gen-
tle, soothing effect it has on all in-

In December, I SIM. . the first , branch of the
Paulifit order outside of New York was es
tablished at old St. Mary's Church. There
was a significance in this fact. Because, as St.
Mary's, ptanding on Â¦ the slope of the; only
street of Pan Francisco called after the State
of California, will always-remaln a landmark
of the energetic and stalwart Celtic pioneers,,
so it was meet and Just that her ancient fame
should be revived. This pioneer cathedral,
after 1S91. glorious with all the memories of
the past, seemed to me to feel that It was
neglected.
* AH people love California. I do not know
why, but there Is something about California
that makes all people love her. 1 David Starr

sure that.it would- break the hearts of : our
Paulist rathere If they were forced . to leave
us. Let us register a, vow that they will not
be permitted to feel as strangers in our midst.
. The following programme was ren
dered:*
Among those in the boxes were: James
D. Phelan and party, Mrs. Richard To
bin and party, Mrs. Downey. Harvey
and party, Mrs. if. H. de Young , and
party, Mrs. A. H. Payson and party
and Mayor. Schmltz and party.
Members from the Knights of, Colum
bus, the Young Men's Institute and the
Gaelic Dancing Club were also present.
The programme was an elaborate one
and embraced numbers by both profes
sionals and amateurs. S. H. Friedland
er of Fischer's Theater was stage man
ager, and everything consequently
moved like clockwork.^
Frank J. Sullivan opened .the. en
tertainment with a speech pertinent to'
the occasion. He said in part:
Your presence here this evening is the moat
eloquent of tributes to the piety, zeal . and
popularity cf the father* of the Paullst com
munity, and to your lovÂ« of the cathedral of
the Catholic pioneers. In 1875 Bix of the Paul
lst fathers made a. visit. to this city and then
awakened among men and women of all be
liefs a religious enthusiasm until then un
known.
The vaudeville. entertainment for the
benefit of the jubilee improvements in
Old St. Mary's Church attracted a great
crowd to the Alhambra last evening.
The theater was beautifully decorated
with a wealth of long palms and
hundreds of golden chrysanthemums
artistically arranged by Mrs. Solly Wal
ter and Miss Louise Daly. The audito
rium looked like a spacious home resi
dence decorated for an evening recep
tion. The boxes were filled with lovely
women in evening dress,- while every
seat in the building was taken and
many were compelled ; to stand during
the entire performance.^.
E. W. Hazen of Chicago, Western'
agent of a well-known Eastern pub
lication, who is visiting this city, was
the guest of the Ad Club at a banquet
given last night in the conservatory
hall of the Palace Hotel. R. C. Avers,
president of the club, presided at the
gathering, which was entertained by
an interesting talk by the guest of ths
banquet on how California products
should be advertised In the East. He
insisted that the first etep to be taken
in the marketing of any product is to
gain the confidence of the public,
which, once obtained, insured ready
readers of advertising articles pertain
ing to the product and greatly facil
itated the efforts of the producer in
increasing the demand of the product.
. John P. Young, managing editor of
the Chronicle, spoke of the "News
paper's Mission in Advertising Cali
fornia-" He said that the papers were
deeply interested in the welfare of the
State, for Its progress meant greater
circulation for them. He was followed
by Arthur R. Briggs, who dealt with
the past successful work of the State
Board of Trade in advertising the
State- H. P. Stabler, the well-known
fruit man, recited many interesting ex
periences of the fruit men in advertis
ing the dried fruits of California and
strongly advocated liberal advertising
of the product as the best means of
increasing the demand abroad.
"California's Opportunities" was the
'subject discussed by F. J. Cooper, who
was followed by E. M. Swasey with an
address on the "Follow-up Organiza
tion, in an Advertising Campaign." S.
P. Johnson delivered the concluding
speech of the evening, his theme being
-The Advertising Man and His Work."

private > business college in California
was burned. : His textbook for business
colleges won him a local friend, Charles
Ellis, and the Ellis â¢ Publishing- Com-

BATTLE CREEK, Mich.; Oct. 27.â
Neil S. . Phelps, .chairman" of the Phelps
Sanitarium ; and,' tHe, Ellis < Publishing
Company,*, treasurer Â¦ of the Malta \Vita
Pure Food Company and a stockholder
in several other local industries," -is
missing.. Leaving home on Suhdayvun
announced, Phelps has neither been
seen \ nor heard of since. . Whether he
committed suicide or left the country
rather: than; face financial embarrass
ment is a* mystery.
One year ago ; Phelps, who had â¢ been
considered - the richest man in Â¦ Battle
Creek, called a meeting of his creditors
and said he Â¦ could not meet their, de
mands. ; The millions he had imade in
pure food and other, speculations -had
been lost, through unprofitable invest-'
ment in new industries. To give him a
chance to save himself the creditors
gave Phelps a year to repair his losses.
This year ends next Friday and Phelps
cannot, meet his \ creditors. Â¦ He ; had
worn out". his brain in an- effort to fill
the financial breach, . until, broken in
health and mentality, it is positive that,
whether, he ; has 1 committed suicide or
fled, : his mind was unbalanced.

Young W. Casteel, who in June shot
and almost killed President Durham
of the Durham Business College, swal
lowed carbolic acid last Wednesday
night and ended his life. His trial
on the chargt? of an assault with intent
to commit murder was to have begun
in Judge Slogan's court yesterday.
Casteel was an invalid. He came
here about a year ago. His dispute
with President Durham was concern
ing money matters, he having charged
Durham with getting the best of him
In a transaction involving Casteel's in
terest in the college. Casteel's body
was found yesterday morning in his
room at 480 Ellis street, the St. Kath
ryn Hotel. A glass which had con
tained carbolic acid lay at his side.
He left several notes to friends, the
most explicit of which regarding his
Intention was one addressed to A. A.
Cronk. In this he asked Cronk to
Bee to the disposition of his baggage
and himself.
Continuing he wrote as follows:
If it can be so rnanaped I would be glad to
cave things attended to as quietly as possible.
Am inclosing; key to my trunk. Wight keep
eutt case, too â thlnpa left In closet of no value.
Thack all the folks and the boys for kind
ness and give them come kind of evening
when you can get them torether. My brother.
TV. G. Casteel, Meridian, Miss., will attend to
m-hatÂ«?ver expense is Incurred â have sent him
a check to cover everything. Yours.
T. W. CASTEEI*
Another letter to Hotel Clerk Met
calf gives instructions as to the dis
position of his effects. The following
paragraph occurs: "Inclosed find some
cigar money for yourself and a five
for Mr. Dick, our good-natured ele
vator man."
Albert A. Cronk. when inter
riewed yesterday, said that he did not
believe the cause of Casteel's suicide
*-a s owing to the trial, but that he had
been despondent and ailing. He said
that Casteel had visited Europe in
srarch of cure and had failed. His
euicide was a surrender to disease
and despondency.
R. L. Durham, president of the Cali
fornia Business College, made a state
ment last night in which he said that
although Casteel had deliberately at
tempted to kill him he bore the un
fortunate man no ill will. He said
that in the interest of society he felt
compelled to with the .prose
rution, but felt no animosity and the
prosecution was distasteful to him. He
further said that he felt sympathy for
the family of the unfortunate man and
considered him mentally irresponsible.

Faint Spells
'Are very often attributed to biliousness.
and tb<? stomach is treated to cathartics.
That's wrong.
Faint spells are often accompanied by
; biliousness, but you will also ... notice
shortness of breath, asthmatic breathing,
â¢ oppressM feeling in chest, weak or hun-
gTy spells, which are all early symptoms
of heart weakness.
; Don't make the mistake of treating the
. etomacb when the heart Is the source of
the trouble.
Dr. Miles'
New Heart Cure
Will strengthen the nerves and muscles
of the heart, and the fainting spells. , to-
gether wjth all other heart troubles.. will
disappear.
â¢ "Four years ago I was very low with
heart trouble, could hardly, walk. One
day I had a fainting spell, and thought I
would die. Soon after I began using Dr.
Miles' Heart Cure, and after, taking three
bottles I feel Â¦ that I am cured." â MRS.'
EFFIE CLOUGH, Kl Is worth Falls,

The first bottle will benefit, if not, the

That was all on that subject, but
Captain Nance proceeded to relieve
his mind on another topic, saying:
"Another thing which shows your
lack of discipline is the habit some of
you have of wearing part of your uni
form about the campus outside of the
drill hour. Of course, .what you do
outsiae the drill hour is no concern of
mine', but I intend to see President
Wheeler and learn whether the matter
can be remedied."
Captain Nance was to give his first
lecture in tactics and all the seniors
and many of the Juniors were present
in the Srill hall to listen.' Before the
time for instruction began the men
walked about the room, pushing
chairs as they secured seats. Captain
Nance objected decidedly to the noisy

"You lack discipline, ' apparently.'
You have acted like school boys-to

like school boys. As men you ought
to be able to take your seats noise

day to answer before United States CommU
slontr Manley In San Francteco to a chare*
of tampering with the malls. He took a
package off a box at San Lorenzo where hÂ»
lives. He afterward returned the content* Â»f
the package to the owner, but a complaint had
already been made.
the topic discussed byE. F. Adams. He
said a business man is one who knows
what will pay in his business. The mis
takes made by farmers who neglect
simple business principles, who operate
without regard to cause and effect and
permit political managers to fool them
into betraying their own Interests, were
described by the speaker, who said In
conclusion:
It appears that when the farmer uses the
brains he has to deal with his aflairs in a
business like way; to locate and stop all
wastes of production; to produce as far as he
can only the best of its kind; to grade It hon
estly and sell it for what it is; to Â«Â»^P el *J*
faithfully with his fellows; to cultivate friendly
relations with his salesmen, his bankers and
his customers; then will he demonstrate his
power of economic survival and vindicate his
right to be called a business man.
Professor Elwood Mead, chief of irrU
gation and drainage investigations,
United States Department of Agricul
ture, Washington, D. C, told the Insti
tute how desirable it is that a depart
ment of agricultural engineering be es
tablished at. the California State Uni
versity. He said that It is a branch of
engineering which has long been recog
nized in Europe, but which has not un
til the last decade been taught in this
country. Conditions are changing, how
ever, and "Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota
and Nebraska- have provided for such
instruction, or contemplate doing so,
in special buildings or with special ap
pliances and instructors. Â¦
The greater opportunity in California
grows out of its climate, which makes
Irrigation a necessity; out of the large
areas of swamp and overflowed lands,
which must be redeemed by dykes and
drains; by the vast level stretches of
fertile farming land,- which make the
use of complex and costly machinery
possible, and the high prices and scar
city 'of farm labor, which render the
use of the machinery a necessity. It is
a liind of training needed ;by the farm
er to enable him to apply water to his
fields with less waste and loss; to know
how to reclaim lands ruined by seepage
and alkali; to know how to select, ad-
Just and repair pumping machinery.- :
OTHER SPEAKERS
Charles H. Bentley, manager of the
sales department of the Calif ornia Fruit
Canners' Association, spoke during the
afternoon session on "The Merchant, as
a- -Factor in Marketing." ." He depre
cated the idea of farmers that the mid
dlemen must be eliminated, declaring
that his function is Inevitable and
proper. - He said co-operation as < a
means t)f escape from the middleman
or merchant had failed because of the
farmers' inability to nurse the business
of selling his product at the time he
worked to bring it forth. The idea that
because so much fruit had been con
sumed in one . year, so much must be
consumed the 'next is unwise, the
speaker said. He said fruit is not. an
absolute necessity.;. Its sales Increase
as, "the".' product;. m is' advertised, pushed
and properly handled, and this 'work he
believed the merchant" did legitimately
and well. The .merchants are not get
ting rich while the farmers starve, j for
there, are more failures than' successes
in the business. :
"Plato, referring to his citizens for an j
ideal republic," said the 'speaker,
"spoke of salesmen or merchants as
those who did that work because of In
ability or unfltness to' do anything else.
Let your humble merchants, then, now,
as in Plato's time, continue to buy and
sell and trade in your product, because
they really may not be able to do any
thing else." . Â¦
The improving and beautifying of
California's highways was the subject

BERKELEY. Oct. 27.â In an attempt
to Â¦ crystallize * the sentiment prevailing
ih " the [ sessions' of the - Farmers' Insti
tute resolutions Â¦ were ' adopted this
afternoon asking the State Legislature
to appropriate money.for. the construc
tion of an agricultural . building and - a
farm school at the University of Cali
fornia. The Legislature will also be
asked in .these resolutions. 'to pass a
law incorporating agricultural studies
into the curriculum of the State nor
mal schools.
The resolutions are the outgrowth of
the current sessions \of the institute,
where the value of agricultural educa
tion has-been thoroughly explained by
experts. . Three sessions were Â¦ held . to
day by the farmers and those who are
interested in institute work, the " in
stitute : coming to an" end to-night with
an illustrated lecture by Professor El
wobd' Mead on "Irrigation "Abroad,"
being" an account of recent observa
tions in foreign countries. ,"...-
Hearst Hall was filled this morning
when President Wheeler declared the
institute open, introducing W. V. Staf
ford,-State commissioner of labor sta
tistics; who spoke of "Farm Labor in
California." .The 'speaker referred to
the efforts of his office to gather'sta
tistics ' relating to ~ the condition : of
farm labor/ and to procure 'information
about what Â¦ could be done to benefit
farm laborers. Scores of remedies
were suggested, such as Sunday saloon
closing, exclusion' of foreign workmen,
organizing unions, more churches,
smaller farms, fewer hours and better
pay, etc. !
The fact' that new comers to the
State seeking employment are usually
landed In the larger cities where they
are likely to stay, if they can, is one
reason, the commissioner believes, why
the farmer gets the dregs* of the labor
ing population.
Â¦ Continuing, the speaker said:
PATIENCE NECESSARY.
It â¢ Is regrettable that while there have been
highly Intelligent and splendidly organised ar
rangements for placing the land on the market
for the small purchaser, ; extraordinary pa
tience and toil In every direction for the de
velopment of the products of thÂ« State aw
necessary. - . . . . . . . . . ."Â¦ -
'- Are the farmers ' as a class blameless In the
matter? Have they put a tithe of the energy,
care, and money Into the: labor question . that
they have In every other branch of their busi
ness? And If they have made effort have they
made It consistently? Can they expect the
floating farm labor of. the State to elevate
Itself under adverse conditions without . sys
tematic . aid from the employer? Baths,
libraries," profit sharing plans and other de
vices may be used with excellent effect. .
C. H; Markhanv' former vice presi
dent and 'general manager of the
Southern Pacific Company, who was" to
have read a paper on "The Farmer and
the Railroad; Their 'Relations," sent a
letter, regretting his inability to at
tend." In his' letter to the institute Mr.
Markham said:
MARKHAM'S METTER. < 'Â¦'' : [
, .The . business* of â¢ transportation t may enjoy
a kind of advantage from the system of buy-
Ing abroad and selling abroad, but It is an ad
vantage of the present which must be charged
up against errors, to save the wastes, to vital
ize t v e labors of the farm. My own wish Is
that - every school In the country were com
pellÂ«d. to teach the elements of agricultural
science.- This must come In time, since we are
working around to the practical ground that
the best Instruction is that -.which enables men
and . women to get their living decently. But
the time of Â¦ universal instruction - In Industry
as distinct from academics is not yet. As yet
there in no systematic, aducation for the farmer
excepting that which sifts . out to him in one
way or another . through the university. Meet-
Ings like those at Berkeley are of the highest
value In that they serve to develop interest
and to promote Inquiry with respect to matters
upon which the productive life of the country,
and ' therefore Its permanent prosperity are
chiefly dependent. It is for us as an-agri
cultural people to revise our methods, . to
adapt our system to new . times and conditions,
and when this shall be done a day of larger
prosperity than It has ever known before will
dawn upon California. "

for express train service. - At One Hun

Swan was brought from San Quentin
this morning and .the operation was
performed .this afternoon.
Wounded by the accidental discharge
of his own revolver, Bert Swan, a for
mer Deputy County Clerk of Alameda
County, who now holds a position as
turnkey at the State penitentiary at
San Quentin, lies at the point of death
at Providence Hospital from the effects
of blood poisoning resulting from the
wound. In a final effort to save his
life the physicians to-day amputated
Swan's left leg above the .knee. The
operation. was performed by Dr. Frank
L. Adams, assisted by Dr. D. D. Crow
ley. What the result will be is uncer
tain,' but there is grave doubt that
Swan will recover.
The accident occurred at the McRea
Hotel, at San Quentin Point on the
evening of October 20. Swan was show
ing a new revolver to some friends
and had, as he supposed, removed all
the cartridges, buu through an over
sight he left one chamber loaded. - He
snapped the trigger upon the loaded
chamber and the bullet entered his left
thigh. At first it was thought that Swan
would soon recover, but in a few days
blood poisoning set inland yesterday
the, doctors decided that - the leg must
be -amputated at once. . -.

When Sanford read the note he took
it'to the Rev. Ann Ware, a professed
minister of Christ's Church of Healds
burg and asked her if the marriage
was an illegal one and in 'trepidation
she took- it to the County Clerk's office,
where she was informed that only or
dained asd licensed ministers were al
lowed to perform the marriage cere
mony.
Sanford had only been acquainted
wfth his supposed wife a short time
and now does not know where to find
her. Mrs. Ware says she believed she
had a right to marry the couple and,
knowing Sanford, she agreed to per
form the ceremony. -V;
The marriage license was . issued to
Winsor D. . Sanf ord . and Mrs. Sidney
Horsford, who gave their ages as over
twenty-one. They were, apparently,
each near the forty mark. They took
up their abode at 706 Broadway, but
when Sanford went to their rooms to
day he found the following note await
ing him: ;A. t .,
Mr. Fan fort: I asked a lawyer this morning
about oar marriage, and be said It was not
leK&V: that that woman had to be a licensed
mtnitter before' she coul'd do It, and had to
have a witness, bo I think It la better for me
to. Kay with my children alone, a* I don't
want to marry.
I am going to. Salt Lake. Utah. In a few
days. You can get a wife somewhere else.
Good-by.
A peculiar marriage and an . odd
sequel Â¦were brought to light to-day
when it was learned that Mrs. Sidney
Horsford, who, on Monday last,
plighted her troth to Winsor D. San
ford, had taken .advantage of the fact
that a woman without, authority had
performed the ceremony.. Tne wife then
backed out of her bargain and told her
would-be husband that he could get a
wife somewhere else.

SAN MATEO, Oct. 27. â William
Whlpple Hull, a retired brick man
ufacturer and a rÂ»ioÂ»eer of this coun
ty, died at his home near San Carlos
at 10 o'clock this morning, aged 82
years. Deceased came to California
from New York in 1860 and to this
county seven years later. He was de

Lugannini is a typical child of Italy,
although his mother is an American.
He is a handsome, broad-shouldered
lad of more than ordinary height, and
looks to be at least 18 years old.' . He
has been weeping ever since he was
taken into custody, seeming more anx
ious over Mrs. Cahoon's condition than
Sis own predicament. When he was
taken before Mrs. Cahoon to-day she
admitted that he had shot her.
"But he did not mean to do iU" she
added. "He is more than life to me,
and be himself would lose his young
life rather than see me harmed."
CINCINNATI, Oct. 27.â Mrs. Maud
Cahoon, Ihe 25-year-old wife of a
wealthy mine owner and fruit grower
of California and Florida and a daugh
ter of the late Colonel William Rlngo.
a wealthy citizen of Newport, Ky., was
chot and seriously wounded last night
by Charles Lugannlni, 15 years old, a
bellboy at the Gibson House, where he
met Mrs. Cahoon, who was a patron
there.
Mrs. Cahoon was out with a - man
friend last night, and Ehe told Lugan
ninl to meet her at the entrance to her
brother's apartment at 11:30 o'clock.
There, according to the stories of both
Mrs. Cahoon and the boy, she tried to
secure from the boy a revolver he had
borrowed from her some time ago, and
In the playful scuffle which followed
the revolver was discharged and Mrs.
Cahoon was shot through the abdomen.
Lugannlni in fright ran to his home,
nrar by, and Mrs. Cahoon made her
\eay up two flights of stairs to her own
apartments and undressed. When weak
from pain she was compelled to call
her 6ister, who was sleeping at the
other end of the house. She told her
fdster that Ehe had accidentally shot
herself.
* Finally the woman admitted that she
bad. been shot by young Lugrannini ac
cidentally. The boy was then arrested
and taken to police headquarters, where
he told virtually the same story. This
morning he was taken before Judge
Caldwell of the juvenile court, who
after hearing his story released him.
Eaying that if any one was to blame it
was the woman.

Fred James stole blankets from a
H. S. Clement said that his wife had
gone to visit relatives In Santa . Rosa
when he, feeling lonesome, 'wandered
into Union Square and fell asleep while
sitting upon a bench. . Patrolman Ma
loney, however," testified that Mr. Cle
ment was stupidly drunk ana then
Judge Fritz imposed a $5 fine.
Patrolman J. J. Tillman met Frank
Henney and Raymond Willis McKnlght
at an early hour yesterday morning on
Third Etreet, and as each of them had
a package In his hand he courteously
stopped them and requested to be in
formed as to the contents of the pack
ages. He was told by Mr. . McKnight
that the packages were found upon the
sidewalk, but as Mr. McKnight was
recognized as a shady character by the
officer the narrative was disbelieved
and the two men were arrested on sus
picion. Then It was discovered that the
packages contained cigars which had
been stolen from a store a few yards
from where the trio stood. Judge Fritz
wlh hear the case next Tuesday.
Mrs. Alphonse Dellucka went to the
residence, of Mrs. Louis Aguirre, in the
vicinity of Union and Filbert streets, to
demand an explanation as to why. Mr.
Dellucka's affections had been alienated
by Mrs. Aguirre. and Instead of giving
the desired enlightenment Mrs. Aguirre
punched Mrs. Dellucka's face with
clenched ; fists, whereupon the assailed
lady had her husband arrested for cru
elty to herself and her young daughter
by spending his time and his money on
Mrs. Aguirre and her. three , children.
Judge Mogan. will hear more about -it
next Tuesday. , T V>"'
I Judge Fritz continued till to-day the
j case of H. E. Elliott, accused of felony
: embezzlement, and fixed the defen
dant's bail at 5150. Elliott was employ
ed by Yates & Co., dealers in paints,
who allege that some time ago he em
bezzled $171 which he had collected 'for
his' employers. He declares he is the
victim of a plot concocted by his wife,
who. is suing him ~ for divorce. In an
swer to her petition, he says, he men
tioned the names* of a hotel proprietor
and a detective in the United States
secret service and they combined with
her to .weaken his case by having him
convicted of embezzlement.

Elvira Croce again declined to prose

seriously wounded hei* one night on
Montgomery avenue' and : Judge Mogan
perforce dismissed the case.
"I was going with. him a long, time
and we were lovers and "had a lovers'
quarrel and that's all I have to say, so
there now." And the woman resolute
ly shut her lips and stared intently at
the courtroom ceiling.
"Well," sighed the Judge, "as you
are evidently determined to obtain this
man's acquittal I don't feel justified in
burdening the people with the cost. of
trying him for the crime of which he
is accused a^nd of which his guilt is
apparent. To save him from punish
ment you probably would swear that
he didn't shoot you at all."

Pretty little Rose Salazar_ smiled en
couragingly at nineteen-year-old . John
T. Alllngton, a dental student/ when
the lad faced Police- Judge Mogan to
plead to the charge of having enticed
the girl to leave her parents' -home, 428
Tehama street. But there was no re
sponsive smile from the' youth. He
seemed to fully appreciate the serious
ness of the accusation. His good-look
ing countenance reflected keen anxiety,
which was not lighteped by the prose
cution's statement that the girl was
four years his junior. and that his of
fense was a felony: So absorbed was
he by the gravity of his position that
he never once looked at her. v
Asked if he was willing to make the
child his wife, he eagerly answered in
the affirmative, but his relief was tem
porarily clouded by the announcement
that, being a minor, he could not legal
ly marry without consent of -,-. his
parents. His father and mother, reside
in New York, he informed the. pourt,
and he felt certain they would rather
see him a benedict than a convict.
Wouldn't the -Judge notify 'them by
telegraph of their only 'son's predica
ment and tell them he could be saved
from the penitentiary by obtaining
their acquiescence to his proposed wed
ding? Yes, the Judge -would do that
for the girl's sake. But if the desired
parental consent were withheldâ what
then? So utterly dejected was the boy
by the mere hint of such a 'possibility
that the Judge hastily suggeste'd anoth
er way out. By appointing a guardian
for the boy, he said, necessity of ap
plying to the father and mother might
be obviated. Once more hope illumed
the defendant's face and again the girl
smiled encouragement.
So the matter rests. A* dispatch has
been sent to Gotham informing Mr.
and Mrs. Allington that unless they
wire consent to the proposed union of
their son he may be remanded for trial
in thye Superior Court on a most serious
and disgraceful charge and if they re
spond negatively or neglect to respond
at all a proper guardian will probably
be appointed to approve the boy's mar
riage. The case will again be called
on October 29. . " - !
S. Katsura, a young Japanese who re
cently returned from the Alaska 1 fish

because the latter questioned the likeli
hood of some narratives that the former
had brought from the north. ' The
weapon was a knife, and it inflicted an
ugly but not necessarily fatal wound in
Kama's cranium. Katsura will be tried
before Judge Mogan forÂ»assault with a
deadly weapon. .-
Mrs. Cornelia Burbank of 174 Fourth

square, wrote and dispatched the fol
lowing self-explanatory message:

heat of passion picked up. a lighted

where it was in a fair way of starting
a serious conflagration" when Mrs.
Abrams quenched the flame and ' had
him arrested. The policeman in the case
testified that the womanls prompt ac
tion wa^ all that averted a fire of most
damaging proportions, as the house was
of timber and surrounded with equally
inflammable structures. . Judge Mogan
will dispose of the case to-day. '
"When Miss Dumas was judicially pro
nounced guilty as charged and request

expressed herself as deeply shocked.
Miss Rose Dumas feared that some

had ever been allowed to pay for grati

OUT of the nebulous haze of the Democratic -platform it ap
pears that tariff tinkering is one of the few issues upon which
any degree o( unanimity is reached by supporters of Judge
Parker. Instant revision of the protective system is demanded, a
revision which would amount to nothing less than destruction in
the hands of a Democratic Congress. Upon this peg there is made
to hang campaign talk about the condition' of labor, the "busting"
of trusts and the imminence of general calamity.
Before the voter gives ear to these siren calls of distracted
Democracy it would be well for him to pass in review the phe
nomenal growth ,of American commerce abroad, which has been;
rendered possible by the protection of American industry at home
under the Republican tariff. In the year 1903 the- United States
beaded the list of the four great exporting nations of the world,
leading Great Britain by $12,948,572, Germany by $492,231,302 and
France by $571,560,302. Even with this, our domestic trade between
State and State equaled in gross value the entire^international com
merce of the world.
From the reports of our consuls in foreign; ports come monthly
news of the, invasion of American manufactured products into the
very fastness of: old .world trade centers. American harvesting ma
chines cut the wheat of Russia, American watches are sold in the
shops of Geneva,; American locomotives have' been contracted for
by. the managements of Indian railroads, American steel girdles 'thei
great. Atbara bridge. Thus the tale of our successes abroad grows
larger with every year passed.
- The stability 'of our ,trade with foreign markets depends upon
-the protective" tariff. 'This assertion needs no, proof other : than a
. comparison between the. export ; figures of the ' four lean ] years of : free
trade and those of the succeeding, fat "years of protection. The cbh
.fidence of the manufacturer. reposes in the;^^ tariff; scheme :>tHaf has
brotight him unexampled -prosperity. A;-juggling with", this scheme
by- hands inimical to its existence would confi

J. Pierpbnt Morgan-is gifted with a
great deal:more of humor than Is gen

London, he was introduced to a woman
who made some pretensions to peerage.
"Pardon me," said the woman, haught

"Oh, we are an independent branch,"
replied Mr. Morgan, slyly, "but we date
back to the â¢ Norman kings." "Ah,

Morgan dug down into his pocket and

M. Henri Bergson, in a curious book
which he calls "La Rire. f \ explains why
we laugh. He has a novel theory to ac
count for our laughter, which is that
automat* _i is the real genesis of the
comical. * I â¢
In gesture, says M. Bergson, the
movements -of the human body are
laughable in the exact degree in which
that body reminds us. of a mechanism.
For instance, why do we laugh when
an orator, making an eloquent gesture,
upsets the glass of water placed before
him?... We 'do* not laugh , because the
motion was . an unexpected one, but
because the body ceased to be under
control and was mechanical. Had the
Bpeech-maker had an apoplectic stroke
it would have been just as unexpected,
but we should- not have laughed.
Speeches which" make us laugh, M-
Bergson goes on, are those which come
out automatically. For Instance, "If I
die, will you come to my funeral?"
"With pleasure." And. of course, au
tomatism in a situation makes for
laughter, such as the celebrated situa
tion in the "Chapeau de Paille d'ltalie,"
when a whole marriage; party searches
for a straw hat which a horse has
eaten. There is something novel about
this theory of M. Henri Bergson. ;'

. During, the fall. and 1 winter furs of all
kinds will be ' used for dress and hat
trimmings.'" Bear fur Is to be .revived.
Any dainty edge of fur on velvet or
cloth is effective. Evening gowns and
tea gowns are trimmed with : the finest
threads of exquisite furs. An imported
hat appeared a few. days ago with "an
edging of fine, fur tracing the outline of
the.'; lace medallions 'of which \the Â¦ hat
was made. Fur unites beautifully, with
cashmere. Cashmere will be worn more
this ; season . than ; for s some J time past:
This . introduces fur into; -'.the combina

abundance of styles . . and V beautiful
models one finds ' it rather difficult . to
choose. .' . v . :Â¦'â¢:.
Fur Trimming.
Shirt waist suits for: the house: are a
necessity, and the present modes are all
that 'could be, desired in that ' line.
There is a large Â¦ assortment, and a big
variety of different' styles and designs,
and they come in all colors and ma
terials. Silk'braid ribbon /binding and
fringe is used quite a little and much
embroidery is appearing on the fancy
waist 'of heavy material. .The surplice
waist affords many; opportunities tor
elaborate and becoming trimming, and
also 'many are worn with ' the "V" low
neck. Tucks,: plaits and shirrs ;cpn T
stitute much of the fullness and fancl
ness,and'a waist is not. complete un
less yards and yards of material are
utilized in the making. ' \
;vA 6Uit which would catch the' fancy
of any woman who was a bit artistic
was .of light blue albatrv ss. The waist
was,- tucked Â¦ finely * to. the line,
"where it was loose. Black velvet rib
bon was used as straps with,' a tiny
tassel on each end. A sort of Mexican
braid formed an elaborate design
across the front and over the shoulder
seam. White embroidery /Â¦Â¦ of extreme
fineness was employed -as* the. ;yoke.
Other pretty little suits are; made of
'cashmere,' heririetta and even' lawns
are being made up for winter wear.
, As white is so 'â¢Â¦ fashionable, a ma
jority of women prefer it to any color,
and the daintiest of frocks are due to
the popularity of white. The separate
waists." to be worn are made of the

velvet. .Inhere is no objection to 7 a cot
ton-backed article, but one., with a
short nap is always preferable and one
that sells at not less than $1 a yard*. -In
the matter of dress linings care should
be taken in selecting one which l's sup
ple and light in weight.
When silk, is used, for this- purpose,
one that is soft and crumples easily in
the hand and yet which will smooth
out without a wrinkle is by far^ the
most satisfactory- But nowadays many
women prefer a fine, soft percaline or
some similar material in preference to
silk, for the reason that it lies closer
to the figure and is more easily .mold-'
ed to the lines of the body than the
silk. Â« ..-.- ... . Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢am

IT is strange that commerce should entertain myths and be**dis
quieted by nightmares. One of these, b'ogies is the yellow peril,
in its commercial form. As China has great iron and coal de
posits and other resources undeveloped, it has been held "in some
quarters that their development will be an injury to the Western
nations. This is a fallacy. That part of the Western hemisphere oc
cupied by the United States has proved to be the richest in natural
resources of any part of the globe, and it has added to the wealth
of the rest of the world. According to those who cower before the
commercial yellow peril, the development of North America should
have been a misfortune instead of a blessing to mankind.
An intelligent Chinese, connected with the maritime customs
of that empire, in an official report, deals with this subject, to this
effect : "The development of industrial enterprises, the extension of
railways and the exploitation of the mineral resources of the coun
try are likely to have important effects upon trade in the near future.
Industry leads to wealth, and wealth brings demands for goods.
It is surprising that the prophecy should sometimes be heard that
the Chinese will import less as they manufacture more. Experience
teaches that the contrary is invariably the case."
It is strange that the myth of the peril of the civilized awakening
of China should persist in the fact of. the world's experience with
awakened Japan. That island empire started in her present commer
cial career in 1878. In old Japan the merchant and trader was
frowned upon. The soldier was in Ihe highest class. The merchant
was one of the lowest. This ancient classification had to be over
come and the Japanese merchant had - to fight his way up - in the
esteem of his # own country. In 1878, the total -foreign commerce of
Japan amounted to 60,000,000 yen. In twenty, years it~ rose to 400,
000,000 yen. In 1903 Japanese imports from the States alone
amounted to 50,000,000, nearly equaling the entire; foreign trade of
that country in 1878. Our trade with Japan increased- thirty fold in
twenty years. Now suppose that China take on the same transforma
tion as Japan, and instead of the trade of 48,000,000 of people the
world enter trade with the 420,000,000 of Chinese, it will be seen
that the yellow peril to commerce is a creation of the imagination.

Yet this is just what many a lovely
length of ribbon Is doing. To be sure
the coats thus adorned t are ' evening
wraps, and. 'the ribbon is vouchsafed
as a slight recompense for the col
larless condition of the coat. It really
was auite a severe throat test to jump
from the ubiquitous storm collar of a
few seasons back to the utter bareness
offered of late. The feminine throat re-,
sented the radical change, so, as a sop
to this denuded member, we have the
ribbon collar. ' ' . . -
s These ribbon collars are formed
thus:/ A couple of Â¦yards or mofe of
five-inch ribbon in lovely pastel print-
Ings- are reauired.; At about-the mid
dle of j this lensrth/- the ' ribbon' ;ts
wrinkled on a two-inch, bit of neatly
covered whalebone, to ;hold It up in
place.; This" is " placed' at the center
back of the neck of the coat. â¢ The
lower edge of the ribbon is then deftly
caught the rest of the way around. It
is gathered in again at each side of the
front, and the ends are then. allowed
to fall free, or they are j tied.* :This
finish' is noted both on cape and coat
models.-â Philadelphia Record. Â»
In our most fanciful sartorial
dreams we hardly saw ribbon serving
as the collar of a coat.
Another feature of sleeves, especially
those in wraps, is the whaleboned
shoulder. Whalebones in many of these
extend four or five inches beyond the
real; shoulder. ..!;,. - Â¦-Â¦
At last the hoop is here!
1 The fact will in no wise gratify the
I-told-you-so sort of person, however,
since the hoop distends the sleeves in
stead of the skirt.
This particular sleeve Is of ivory
moussellne in a dress of dainty green
eollenne. It is one mass of fullness
and just above the elbow there are
dainty little shirringa, the center "one
of the cluster of three concealing a
reed no thicker than a wire. This
reed is a hoop, however. It is about
nine inches in diameter and is "Restor
ationy" enough to please the most .ex
treme taste.
Think of. it, a' black jet' necklace!
One now for sale consists of a row of
cut jet nail heads, and from these are
pendent the dearest old lot* of grand
motherly pendants, pear-shaped af

one of coquettes now turning to d.ust,
says the Chicago Journal. Such neck
laces in gold are not as large and aim
at rich â¢ ornamental effects. Indeed,
the more delicate these designs, the
more pleasing, for their exquisite
workmanship is kepb above mere
weightiness. The La Valliere is as
much liked as ever, and some superb
examples show f stones in as many as
five colors. Well chosen and artisic

CALIFORNIA, with over a thousand miles of frontage on_the
Pacific Ocean, and with its superb geographical position rela
tive to the future great markets of the world, is essentially a
maritime State; and it is of vast importance that its citizens should
be encouraged to seek to obtain their share of the benefits to be
derived from the transportation of the wealth of the world which
is destined to pass through its harbors.
Among the burdens that shipping owned and registered in this
State now bears is that of State and municipal taxation, which, fol
lowing the precedent established by other important seaboard States
in the Union, should be at once removed. California should no
longer subject its shipping property to such a severe handicap in
competition with vessels flying a foreign flag or owned in other
States which use our harbors on equal terms and yet pay no taxes.
Shipping property, unlike other property, is primarily governed
by Federal law â it pays tonnage dues to the United States ; the
owners, officers and crews are amenable to Federal law; it is
operated upon the seas and harbors under laws made by and obtains
its protection from the Federal Government. , V'
The State imposes a tax termed dockage on such property for
the privilege of using a wharf. The municipality imposes taxes for
police, fire, street, sewer and other municipal purposes of which
shipping property cannot avail itself, at least to any appreciable de
gree, for the main reason that shipping property, to be of value, must
be engaged in duties outside of the jurisdiction of the municipality or
State, except during the time of loading and discharge at a city front
wharf, and while so engaged is taxed every day by the State for
the use of the wharf. Neither the State nor the municipality accords
one iota of assistance or protection to shipping property after it
leaves a wharf, and yet the municipality imposes the heaviest taxes,
while giving practically nothing in return.
It is a peculiar hardship that shipping property should be made
to pay not only the same taxes as are imposed on real and personal
property, but an additional tax to the United States, as well as one
to the State, when, as a matter of justice and common sense, it
should be relieved of all taxes with the possible exception of ton
nage dues to the United States. â¢
It is possible for local shipowners, at a slight inconvenience,* to
register their vessels in other States whose laws favor the owner
ship of ship property, but it would be at the expense of prestige to
California.
All important maritime nations of the world have either, a sys
tem of protection or assistance to their shipping, or are considering
measures to be taken in that direction, and it lies within the duty of
California to follow the lines laid out by her sister States, and to
remove the penalties which she now imposes on the local owner
ship of tonnage. It should be our earnest purpose to .stimulate the
investment of capital in vessels to be built, owned and registered in
this State, and to that end it is hoped that amendment No. n will
receive the hearty support of all who are interested in the welfare of
California, which is destined in the not remote future to be the
greatest seaboard State in the Union.

The great bulk of all the business done in
any of our great cities Is done on the simple
faith that one man has In the honesty and In
tegrity of other men with whom he is doing
business, and that faith is rarely disappointed.
At no time in the history of .the world has
so much of Its business been | In the hands of
upright men of Christian character as to-day.
The business man needs no new. religion,
nor any modification of the old truths as
taught by Christ, and the seed sown by the
Master is deeply Implanted in the business
heart. % . .â¢Â¦-, â¢ ..- .- .
There Is nothing incompatible between a
man being an earnest, far-seeing business man
and aV the same ,time a devout, humble fol
lower of the man of Nazareth.
I believe that the noblest Christian live*
among professing Christians to-day will be
found among the earnest business men. This
Is an age when business men are being tested.
Business men In general deliberately and by
preference choose, the righteous way of doing
business. . *
It has sometimes been doubted whether a
business man can so rise above the sordid in
terests of his business as to obtain ' a clear
vision of that which lies beyond the realm of
material things.
The workintrman will not worship in the
same- house with his enemy, the business man,
so It may be that there will be a religion for
the business man. Such a religion. I think,
would have to be other than Christian, for
Us great founder had only one religion. . His
message was the same to- those that labored
and who were heavy ladened. As it was to
the ruler who came to him by night to find
out if there was a Epecial religion for him.
God has settled the great verities of religion,
and they cannot be changed, and the business
man must make his business conform to these
ereat truths and not seek to shape these
truths to suit his business.
In our day. the man who owns and operates
an industrial establishment no longer meets
the men who work with him in God's house
and there worship together the Father who
presides over the interests of all. men.
'They have come to be enemies, and the time
that* used' to be devoted to the worship of a
common God is now devoted .to the study of
methods whereby they may do the most harm
to each other.

perience advises all young girls who have
pains and sickness peculiar to their sex, to use
Lydia EL Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
Hott many beautiful young girls develop into worn, listless and
hopeless women, simply because sufficient attention has not been paid
to their physical development No woman is exempt from physical
weakness and periodic pain, and young girls just budding into woman-
hood should be carefully guided physically as well as morally. *;: v
If you know of any young lady who is sick, and needs motherly
advice, ask her to write to Mrs. Pinkham at Lynn, Mass., who will
give her advice free, from a source of knowledge which is un-
equalled in the country. Do not hesitate about stating details
â¢which one may not like to talk about, and which are essential for
9, full understanding of the case.

While Graney was pouring his musi
cal conversation into the afternoon air
Gans loomed up on a steady jog ; trot.
The I honeÂ§t", blacksmith rose f rom Â¦ his
seat- and assumed the ' "Welcome to

morean clasped â¢ mitts like long' lost
brothers. -In the Deace and quiet of the^
villa the . big confab Â¦ came off. f _
., ,"In" a; fight of .this kind, the colored
man is liable to get the .worst of the de
cision,"-remarked Gans. |
"If you don't want me for referee just
say so, * Joe, '.V replied Graney. "There
is time â¢ for me to quit." . 7:
'*" -"I'm. satisfied ; with you,'' said Gans.
"You have ' ref ereed v two fights f or " me

There were no brass bands -playing
"HaiKHail, the King Has Came" when
Rddie arrived. ' Gans was out explor
ing ten â¢ miles â¢ tof Marin County â¢ pike
and all T was quiet around Shannon's
villa, except for a slight restlessness of
the contents -of the kegs. Suddenly a
still, small voice piped up, "Here comes
Young -Corbett. ".Â¦Â¦Â¦' ' > , - . â¢ . -,
Shannon's dog woke,' up , and com
menced 1 to. bark.' Up the pike ambled
Eddie â¢ Graney .: and Jack Grant, y Al
Herford Â¦ arose from | his ; seat on the
waters trough, and extended the glad
mitt of welcome. The still, small -voice
that heralded the coming of Young Cor
bett said, "Oh. fudge," and faded.'
: Graney. deposited himself into an
armchair "and "commenced to pour out
reminiscences." "Once upon a time," he
began," "you see it was this-way." And
Al Herford listened* till, his "ears -began
to stretch.- Â¦ : â¢; v
Eddie Graney, the honest blacksmith
and' second" cou/in to the sister's aunt
of the village" blacksmith who stood
under the spreading chestnut .tree, vis
ited â¢ Joe Â¦ Gans' quarters yesterday at
Shannon's villa; - He -was accompanied
by:one v Jack Grant, regarding. whom
the Brltt Bros! & Co.'have nothing but
unparliamentary Tremarks to make.
."While Gans did not box at all yester
day, there is no telling. what he will do
to-day. He. may mix it gently with the
found on him with a search warrant |
and a Dosse. I
'.There is an air of seriousness over the j
henchmen of the Gans camp. Even a
brand new Jest telegraphed ahcati of an }
Orpheum monologist did not . draw a '
smile. "Will Gans make the weight?"!
Is -the question that makes his adher- j
ents look sober. Even the genial Al |
Herford looks as though he had under
taken something that was not as easy !
as rolling* off a log. â¢ ,
There is a decided feeling that Gans)
may not be able to â¢ make the* required i
weight. His weight yesterday j wan j
given out as being 136% pounds. If this |
is correct it is difficult to see where the
extra â¢ pounds can be taken off, as the
Baltimoreman is finely drawn already.!
Referee Graney has announced that if
Gans is overweight andBritt agrees to
fight, he -will call all bets off. as many
people will bet on Brltt because of the â¢
weight handicap. The referee says it j
would not be fair to them to let Gans
come In at 135 pounds.
Gans did not use his cozy little "gym",
at Shannon's at all .yesterday. He did
two ten-mile stunts along the highways
and byways with the patient "Kid"
Sullivan,' At both stunts the "Kid" was
a rank outsider, .finishing after Gans
had changed his wardrobe.
Sullivan's ' face â¢ is Â¦ pretty,; well nicked
up from gentle taps showered upon it
by Cans. .The Baltimorean is getting
ready to disturb classical contour !
of one Brltt, and sometimes forgets that |
the "Kid" is only a substitute.

Of course, the game was one full of
life, strife and action. Both Fitzgerald
and Schmidt were on their mettle and
pitched a* quality of. ball that would go
in- the big league." Fitz had his* game
already signed up and ready for/deliv
ery when Truck Easran erred with a
full house, giving, the Commuters a
starts Â¦: ... :'"Â¦Â¦'Â¦'. â¢:>';-Â¦:.â¢â¢Â¦, ; -.-â¢"-â¢. Â¦ Â¦
With one down in the tenth, Schmidt
slammed the sphere to ' Eagan, who
made a spectacular stop j^nd then erred
on his throw to Nordyke. Ganley died
easily, but' Francka tapped out a safe
one to center,' while , Dunleavy popped
a meek little â¢ fly ," into the*-, diamond,
which both Fitzgerald and Sheehan
overlooked. Schlafley was at bat, and
Oakland might- have broken up the
game had Dunleavy roused himself be
fore Graham whipped the ball to. first,
catching him a foot off the bag. ' ~
Captain Graham Â¦ announced that', he
played the game ~x under protest He
was at bat in the ninth and McLaugh
lin rested on second. Schmidt had al
ready, thrown two strikes over the pan.
Graham deliberately stepped out of his
box and Into the next ball:- pitched.
McLaughlin â¢ went down to third, but
the umpire ordered him back. Then the
stars gathered around the indicator
man and proceeded to discuss the ques
tion. The "umpire stuck by his decision
and Graham protested the game.'
The Tigers were the first to get a man
over the pan. Sheehan led off in the
seventh with a smash to. center, and
Nordyke put him down. Eagan shot a
hot one over third. Devereaux blocked
it, holding Sheehan on the base!? Lynch
kicked a fast one through the - infield
and it put' Sheehan over the, jumps.
, The Â¦; Commuters squeezed -.theirs
through in. the eighth. Devereaux was
passed,, but Byrnes .forced him. Jimmy
pilfered second, and Ganley nearly,took
Delmas off his pins with a hard drive.
Fitzgerald walked Francks : purposely,
and Dunleavy smashed ' a hard' one to
Eagan. , Truck booted the ball around
the loutlll Byrnes sneaked in with the
run. The score:

JAMAICA, Oct. 27.â Were it not for
the caution of the forty-odd bookmak
ers now doing business in the "big ring"
at Jamaica racecourse a "killing 1 .* of
large proportions would have been
made to-day when the Canadian turf
man. Joseph E. Seagram, won the Rav
enswood handicap, the fourth race on
the card, with Scotch Plume. As it- was,
however, many thousands of dollars
were taken out of the ring. Had Sea
gram been present a great deal more
money would have been won over
Scotch Plume's victors'. "With Hamburg
Belle. Grenade, Mineola and Rapid
Water all at short odds, as good as 50
to 1 was laid early in- the betting
against Scotch Plume, which was rid
den by the little apprentice Ohlandt. The
filly barely defeated the famous Ham
burg Belle, winner of last year's Fu
turity, which was conceding thirty
seven pounds to her conqueror. Scotch
Plume ran a fair race a few days ago,
and to-day more than one player of the
"dope" figured her out to have a
chance. Summary:

in the fifth race, at six furlongs, equals

ran as a team for the entire route, the
former finally winning by a head at the

The talent went entirely to the bad
in the second race, In which Scotch
Irish and Flaxman were conceded the
only real contenders. Neither got any
part of the money.. Hildreth furnished
the winner in his filly Logistella, an 8
to 1 shot, which proved easily the best
and won going away, with a couple of
lengths to spare.
After being virtually left at the post,
Beautiful- and Best came with a mar
velous burst of speed, ran around his
field and won the first race with the
greatest of ease by three lengths. It
was one of the grandest exhibitions of
speed and gameness seen on the track
this season.
CHICAGO, Oct. 27.â Fortune smiled
once more upon Sam Hildreth at Worth
to-day, when he won both races In
which his horses were entered. His
four-year-old mare Niaxus won a sen
sational race when she j beat Rankin a
head in the third event, at one and an
eighth miles. Helgesen kept her well
up all the way, dodging the hot pace
set by Rankin and Swift Wing. When
called upon she moved up rapidly, wore
down Rankin in the stretch and then
outgramed him. when the real test came.

Shipmasters and customs officials
have been persistently annoyed for
years by runners and solicitors board
ing. vessels on their, arrival in this
harbor before 'the customs officers
have had an \ opportunity of complet
ing their work. The law has been
continuously violated in this regard,
yet but few arrests have been - made
and in those cases the punishment has
not' been severe. But Customs Col- :
lector-. Stratum is determined to put
an end to this nuisance, and yesterday
he; called . the attention â¢ of -^United
States ' District Attorney Marshall B.
Woodworth to the matter of the
boarding of the Dutch' ship Europa on
October 1 6 by William Clark, J. Fink
Jr., David Crowley. Sr. and James Sin
nott; Mr. Woodworth assured" Collec
tor Stratton that he would present the
case to' the Grand Jury now in ses-i
sion. . The penalty, is a fine of $200
each, with Imprisonment In ' the dis
cretion, of , the court. Captain G.Bona
of.^the. Europa was fined $1000 by Col
lector Stratton, but upon his showing
that the runners had not boarded the
vessel with his permission the depart-;
ment . exonerated him from , payment
of the- fine. .

When she passed out of the harbor
for Delmar, two men were seen swim
ming away from the British ship Alice
A. Leigrh. They were deserters, and
one of the swimmers ; was struggling
in the water and making a hard
weather trip of it. A boat was hur
riedly lowered from the Gualala for
the rescue of the exhausted' runaway.
The phig was out of the bottom of the
boat â it should have been inâ and
could not be found. This caused de
lay, and the .swimmer, a short^dlstance
off, wu rapidly giving out. The water
was gushing into the boat through the
hole, filling the little craft, and the
rescue was apparently to Â¦ fail because
of the usual lack of preparation. 7 '
But the. man for the emergency was
on the spot and Davy Crockett's one
arm heroics at the cabin door willno
more be played by pugilistic actors.
One of the " men in the . boat Jammed
his thumb into the hole and checked
the inflow of water.: Then * he sat
down in the . boat and his. companion
at the oars pulled away to the rescue.!
It was a painful task for him, but he
kept the water out while the half-;
<lrowned swimmer was hauled Into the
boat and taken back to bis' ship.- The
other deserter got safely ashore. Â¦" The
boat returned to the Gualala and was
hoisted up on the davits. Then the
emergency man tried to ': withdraw
from his task, but the thumb had be
come so swollen that this was impos
sible. The pain extended well up" his
arm. but he had grown to that 'lifeboat
and it was hard to part him from 1L". '
Finally the ship's carpenter was call-'
ed. he was also an emergency man "on
the spot." With his chisel he enlarged
the hole in the boat's planking and re
leased the man. "With her lifeboat un
fit for service the Gualala- went to sea.
because of a much needed little wood
en plug that could not be found when
the last seconds of a human life were
passing away. . '
The preparedness of men oh board
chip for serious accidents was mani
fested in a peculiar incident which oc
curred on the steamer Gualala as she
was leaving this port for Delmar sev
eral days ago. The vessel returned
faere yesterday and her log tells the
story.
The Benbow airship. weighs about 600
pounds. The gas bag. which is cylin
drical in shape, is seventy-five feet long
and about twenty feet wide at the cen
ter, tapering at the ends. The bag con
tains 16,000 cubic- feet of Â«as when- in
flated.- The frame of the ship is of
aluminum and wood, and the power is
derived from a ten horsepower gasoline
motor. Momentum Is given to the air
ship by means of two large sidewheeis
or fans, each consisting of four blades
so constructed that they automatically
fold after completing the stroke against
the air and do- not expand until again
in position to force the airship ahead.
ST. -LOUIS, Oct. 27.â Floating " grace
fully in the air at an average height of
thirty feet above the heads of several
thousand spectators, the airship de
signed and built . by T. . C. Benbow. of
Columbus, Mont.,, made what the' in-'
ventor declares was a successful trial
flight in the aeronautic course at ' the
World's Fair to-day. While Benbow
appeared to have absolute. control over
the machine. _ an anchor rope about
fifty feet lone was used, one end of
which was held by an assistant during
the. entire flight. :
Benbow to-night made the following
statement:
This trial was made to determine the fea
sibility of my airship. I had intended making
a trip over -the Fair Grounds, but found that
the rapid condensation of gas was fast re
ducing the lifting power, and In order to main
tain "an altitude I threw out all my ballast.
During the fifteen minutes I was up my airship
lost sixty pounds of lifting power. The airship
was completely . . under my . control and re
sponded nicely. Â¦ . . .
I intend, if the weather permits." to make a
practical demonstration of the dirigibllity. of
my â¢ airship to-morrow, and I will malce the
start in the middle of the day, when the at
mosphere is warmer.

City Architect Shea reported that the
flights of stairs rebuilt in the Lincoln
School were so rotten - that it is "a
wonder they held their own ' weight.,
He Â¦ recommends that the other three
flights be overhauled. Shea also re
ported that the yards at the Columbia,
Haight. Mission; Golden Gate, Lowell,
Garfield and Henry Durant schools are
in an unsafe condition and new yards
should be built. - He also recommended
that the runways -In the Cleveland
school be rebuilt; "as "the" present ones
are in very .bad shape and , dangerous
for pupils. ; The recommendations were
filed - as there .. are . no funds available
for the repairs. ...:. ;*. " ::* ' . -! -

BACK COIN TO \aCTI3IS
TA COMA, Oct. 27.â The steamship
Prospector returned to Dawson two
weeks ago. after falling In an attempt
to ascend the Stewart River with win
rter supplies for the miners on Duncan,
Hlghat, Ledge, Clear and other streams
of that region. The Upper Stewart
country is thereby left practically
without supplies of any kind for the
winter. The Stewart was found at such
a low stage that the Prospector often
times, ran on bars and had frequently
to resort to the capstan to get over
shallow places. She could get no far
ther than McQuesten Bar, where she
left the bulk of her freight for the win
ter. The perishables were taken back
to Dawson.
The Prospector's hull was badly bat
tered .in attempts to reach the
streams. The officers of the steamship
report the river lower than ever be
fore in the history of Alaskan steam
beating. The. Prospector's forty pas
sengers, who were bound for Duncan,
failed to reach their destination.
The Prospector was the first steamer
In months to attempt the trip up the
Stewart, and her failure leaves many
of the stores and most of the miners
without sufficient supplies to carry
them through the winter. â
The majority of the men there will
Btay until the winter trails are in good
condition and then go to Dawson.

NEW TORK. Oct. 27.â The war scare raged
with great viol- nee in Wall street for a time
aad raraeed the speculative price-level to
â¢which the market had been lifted, but before
the cloee of the day quieter council* prevailed
and the question began to be asked whether
In the event of actu&l hostilities between Rus
sia and Great Britain. American Investment
Â»roj*rtles would be hurt in the proportion indl-
Scated by the plunge ot prices during
the mcrning. *The action of the market in com
perlscn with that of other securities markets
locked as though the damage from the threat
ened clash would converge on American securi
ties. The inference was plain that a weak
technical poelUon made this market entirely
EusceptiblÂ« to a sudden unfavorable develop
ment. This condition of the market has been
pretty plain to careful observer* for some time.
The uneasiness regarding the position which
has grown up with the Â¦ evidences of top
hrai-inÂ» ss for the - last few days was aggra
vated by the warning offered by President Hill
of the Great Northern in a quoted opinion on
the course of the speculation that operators
"bad better be a little cautious or they might
get bumped." The war scare administered the
bump, and it proved rather severe. A decline
in a few minutes of 2 to 3 points running gen
erally through the active list was sufficient
to throw out many speculative holdings and
to necessitate great agility on the part of
holders o* very much larger amounts to pre
vent sacrifice and an Increase indefinitely of
the -pressure upon the market. As It was, the
uncovering of stop-loss orders precipitated
U.rjre speculative holders on the market and
broke tfirouKh all the artificial restraint*
sought ti, be opposed to the fall. The jump
In foreign Â«xchaage and the sharp running up
cf vhett were suggestions of the reality of
th* daarer in the crisis. But the exagger
ated effect upen the stock market was a
demonstration of the artificial conditions which
â¢ud tx-en tuilt up there. The same thing was
a.|->arrnt in the heaviness of the declines - in
stocks which have b?en most subjected to the
bcf-Rfmc process, although the Intrinsic value
of the properties thus represented would be
no more Impaired by an Anglo-Russian war
than would any others In the list of securities.
The stability of bond prices was an additional
illustration of the losses in that department
being almost confined ur convertibles, or such
Â£Â« Y'A u*-ovÂ«-d in sympathy with the undue ad
vances-in their allied clocks. T-ie most direct
effect of the foreign situation upon our affairs
was the additional engagements of gold for
export to Paris. The crisis In the International
m XlmlT% caonot be held responsible for this,
â¢which Is In preparation for a further Russian
loan in th* regular prosecution of the war with
Japan. The threatened Impairment of bank
resource* Is an admonition against excessive
ii^cuUtlon at an unstable level of prices with
torrcwrd money. Reassuring ad vices, concern- |
lr.c tl.c t-TCifprot for an Anglo-Russian settle
ment were of no Influence fora time, but the
market made : a substantial recovery : tn the :
nuietrr nwo-1 of the lat'r trading and the
loi*Â« were largely repaired. â The bull control !
â¢a-aÂ» acatn Â«*ierted and'.' the '.-. market again!
showed the rtli*f afforded .by, the shaking out
of Â«r.wiÂ»-ldy wruJaih-e-: accounts. United
Ktate* Steel' preferred â¢- rallied poorly, and
Ontario and WeÂ«tera . Â«uff ered from an alleged
hitch Â«n the New Haven â¢ cent rol movement.

EASTERN" MARKETS.
Butter, Cheese a-;'.' Eggs.
While several houses continued to offer But
ter at declining prices, tendering their best
goods to buyers at 24c. there were signs that
the downward movement had spent most of
its force, at least for the present. It was
evident from the expreselons of dealers that
the opinion was growing that the market had
got down . low enough and that . at present
quotations the goods could be worked oft. At
the Â«ame time wires from Los Angeles . re
ported that the market there had broken to
23@ 25c, which, of . course, prevents shipments
to that market. Perhaps more steadiness may
develop from now on.
Â¦'â¢: Cheese and Eggs remain as before quoted,,
but .the upward tendency In Eggs Is by no
means as pronounced as It has been, and in
fact ' the lower grades of Eastern are quoted

The New York wires of E. F. Hutton &
Co. yeeterday eaid:
STOCKS â The market was dominated by the
f.TÂ«;r. political situation as a result of con
flicting advices and prices fluctuated rather
Widely. London sent lower price* and followed
with selling orders for about 60,00'i shares of
International stodu and, although It turned
buyer, the forelgi selling ,on balance was
heavy. The celling movement was Influenced'
In part by the engagement of $2.000,0<JO gold
tor export on Saturday. It Js a time for con
servatism in market operations and we advis*
Intending purchasers to wait for another set
back in the u.ark-t before coming In a* buyers.
Speculative centlnr.ect is mixed, with the con
sensus o: opinion rather bearish owing to the
bÂ«:ief that the big financial Interests have un
loaded an enormous line of stocks, which It
will take the market some time to digest.
Meanwhile, during the process of digestion,
sr.aey observers feel that the general list will
be a sale on the rallies. They also make the
-point that technical conditions are different
from those last summer. Prices then were
low and an Immense short interest was out
standing. Big men here are in the stocks.
Quotations are on a high level and the rank
and file of speculators are long. Such con
siderations make conservative operators
what peesimietic. They say. however, they
are bearish only for a turn, as they can see
Bothint? (n the eituation on which to predict
* serious campaign for the fail, save a re
verse- for the Republican party.
Dried Fruits in New York.
Mail advices from New York say:
"Ouito a demand for 80-90 anfl 90-100 Prunes
Is noted, which is said to come principally
from large department stores, which are fea
turing this fruit In their grocery departments. -
This demand, brokers reported yesterday. Is
being supplied with difficulty, there being few
prune* of these elzes offered on the spot. or.
from the Coast. According to one broker he
Â»M unable to secure a car load of the sizes
ramed from any holder of prunes on the epot.
The combined effects of scarcity and in
creased demand are ' causing an upward ' ten
dency to prices, particularly on the Coast,
Â¦where it if understood 90-10rts are not now
procurable at less than a '2c f. o. b. basis.
The only other prunes to which more than
parsing attention Is given by distributors at
pr**er.t are 40-5ob and 00-60s. which also are
scarce on th* spot and offered sparingly for
shipment from the Coast on a 2>4c f. o. b.
basis iur 40s regular count and 2c on the nine
point. Intermediate sizes are quoted on a
l-.sc f. o. b. Coas-t baeis. There is much com
plaint concerning delayed shipments from Cal.
ifornia. which are held to be due to the un
favorable weather conditions Â«i!l prevailing
there. The raisin market was without fresh
features othÂ»r than that presented by the rt
jport published In our last, that packers have
combined on the question of price to be paid
*Â»n raifcine 4n eweat-bcx. This, however, is
Â¦without immediate influence upon market con
ditions. There continues a fair demand for
both Coast and Eastern fancy seeded for
prumpt and early delivery at full price* but
this market -rho-fts little if any interest in
choice seeded. Nothing further has been heard
of the reported purpose of the Coast seeding
combine to reduce the price on choice seeded.
Irspcrted raisins are .quiet and unchanged
Cables from Greece report a decline in the
price of Currants for prompt shipment, and
it was said that London is trying to find a
market here. An eaeler feeling has been de
veloped in this market, end we nÂ«ar of sales
of uncleaned Amalias tn barrels at 4-&c for
old and at a nhade under i%c for new There
*Â»s IJttle call for apricots or peaches but thÂ»
market has lost none of its firmness particu
larly in connection with peaches which. It Is
eaid, sellers here would have difficulty to re
place on the Coast at a parity with present
epot prices. There Is some Inquiry for peeled
patches, which offer on the spot at 16&20c

yesterday's auction sale, the warm weather
putting a damper on the enthusiasm of buy-

against the proposed ordinance Â¦ pro
viding that when roofs are damaged to
the , extent of 4 0 per cent by fire they
shall be repaired ; with fireproof mate

roofs was only 4 per cent of the total
loss from flres in four years, and the
proposed" ordinance would riot r assist
in beau tlfying, the < city as it may pre
vent the buildings of homes.
EmilPohli said the effect of the or
dinance would' be' to, extend .the fire
limits to Baker street, Buena Vista av

many, residences are being erected. He
said .the extension of fire limits should
be confined to districts considered dan

The United States Attorney General
has decided that Collector Stratton
jnuFt continue to exact from the steam
ship companies the head tax of $2
upon aliens in transit. The law pro
vides that no head tax shall be col
lected for this class of passengers, but
the department has insisted that the
tax be paid in the form of a deposit,
to be repaid to the companies upon
proof offered by them that the alien
tourists have passed out of the coun
try three thousand miles from here.
The transportation companies took
the case before the United States Cir
cuit Court, and Judge Morrow, a few
Â¦weeks ago, decided that the collection
of this so-called deposit was illegal.
The Government, however, will con
tinue to collect the tax until Its legal
ity shall have been determined on ap
peals.
Attorney General Hands Down Opin
ion That Deposit 3Iust Be Col
lected Until Courts Interfere.
HEAD TAX MUST BE
PAID OX TOURISTS
The court says it understands that
its position on the question will . put
the city to 'the expense of a special
election, but the law in the matter is
said to be explicit. Justice Angellotti
wrote the opinion and Justices McFar
land, Van Dyke, Henshaw and Shaw
concurred directly with him.
The Supreme Court, yesterday de
livered an opinion setting forth its
reasons for denying Joseph Harrison's
petition that the proposed amendments
to the municipal charter be submitted
to the voters at the approaching gen
eral election. It Is held that that there
must be a period of two' years be
tween all elections on charter amend
ments. The last election of such char
acter took place in December, 1902.
The court also asserts that the Mayor's
concurrence in proposed charter
amendments is not necessary and that
they need not be submitted to him for
approval/ The practical effect of . the
decision is that the people will be called
upon to vote on the charter amend
ments at a special election to be held
some ' time after the first week in De
cember of this year. The Supreme
Court gave its ruling on the question
at Los Angeles a week ago, but did not
then explain it's position.
The Supervisors formulated the pro
posed amendments, most of which cur
tailed the power of municipal commis
sions, and submitted six of them to
Mayor Schmitz for his approval. He
signed one and vetoed, five, so the
board did not send him the other six
teen. The Board of Election Commis
sioners sustained the Mayor and re
fused to place the proposed amend
ments on the official ballot. The Mer
chants' Association also objected to the
submission of the propositions on the
ground that there was a doubt as to
the legality of the plan.
The law says that a vote on charter
amendments Bhall not take place
oftener than once in two years. There
was doubt as to whether this provision
referred directly to the actual vote or
to the ratification by the Legislature.
The court says the phrase, in question
refers to the submission of propositions
to popular vote- The measure was In
troduced for the sake of economy, that
special elections might not" be called
every month or two. . .. .-
The claim of -the Election Commis
sion that the approval of the Mayor
was essential is declared to be without
merit. According to the decision the
Mayor has absolutely nothing to say in
such matters in view of the. fact that
his functions are pot considered "leg
islative."
Kratz's brother, William, was a mem
ber of the Donandt 7 Kratz -Company,
commission merchants, ;and on Feb
ruary; 13, 1903, William collected $16,
64275 and fled with the money. His
brother Albert was with him when he
left. the, office with the money. ' Albert
was arrested in this city and William
was located in Kansas City, where he
was living under an assumed name. He
was brought back, .tried and convicted
and sentenced by. Judge. Dunne to serve
five years in San Quentln. The firm
had . to l go through the bankruptcy
court.
When the case was called In Judge
Dunne's \ court a number of affidavits
were filed , by Attorney Frank J. Mur
phy from V. Kratz of Los Angeles,
father, of the defendant, and attendants
at the bathing establishment and
others to. the effect that the defendant
had been â¢ drowned. Judge Dunne did
not hesitate at that time and after
ward .to express his belief that the de
fendant had not been drowned and that
his disappearance was for the purpose
of. defeating, the ends of justice. As
sistant District Attorney Whiting was
of .the same-belief and color was given
to, that belief when it was discovered
that the bond of $5000 accepted by
Police Judge Fritz for Kratz's release
was missing. Fortunately It was later
discovered amongr some unused bonds
and on .Whiting's motion it was de
clared forfeited. The sureties were V.
Kratz, the defendant's, father; Mrs.
Rhoda M. -White, .defendant's; sister,
and Attorney Hugo A. Newhouse.
Meantime the. District Attorney's office,
had|communlcated with Chief t Wittman
and the result I is \ the . arrest of Kratz.
Judge Dunne is . at r present taking his
vacation, but whenhe returns he will
have'somethlng to say judicially, in re
gard, to Kratz's flight and subsequent
developments. ' ' \ ...>,-.-
Judge Dunne's steadfast belief that
Albert A. Kratz; was not drowned while
bathing at Long Beach on the night of
September 15, but that a plot existed
to ; defeat 'the ends of Justice, has been
confirmed. Kratz is in Jail" at Ron
quillo, Sonora,- Mexico, and Detective
T. B.' Gibson left on last; nlght'B train
with papers for his extradition.
Chief Wittman Â¦ had sent out circulars
with a photograph and description of
Kratz. About a week ago ,- the Chief
received a dispatch f rom C. . T. . Connell
of the; Bureau of Immigration and Sec
ret Service of Arizona that he had seen
a man answering Kratz's description
at Cananea, Sonora. The ! wires were
kept busy and it was soon learned be
yond all .doubt that Kratz was the
man. .The Governor of Sonora was
communicated Jwith and' he issued a
provisional warrant for Krata's arrest.
It was placed In the hands of Captain
Thomas Rynlng of .the Arizona
Rangers, who arrested Kratz and lock
ed- him up in - the Jail at RonquilUx
When searched clippings from the local
papers regarding his supposed death by
drowning were found in his pockets.
Besides the officers mentioned, .' Chief
Wittman received valuable assistance
from Chief Hammill of Los Angeles.
" Kratz was out on- $5000 bonds while
waiting his/ trial in Judge Dunne's
court "on a charge of felony embezzle
ment. On the night of September 15,
about a week prior to the date fixed
for his trial, Kratz was at Long Beach.
About 9 o'clock he hired a bathing ma
chine and it was said that he persisted
in bathing in the surf against the
warnings of the attendants. He was
not seen again and his clothes having
been found in the machine it' was re
ported that he had been drowned.
Dr. Emma L. Merritt wants to get
rid of the management- of ( the Sutro
estate, and she believes that' the quick
est way to do it is to . make the in
come meet the expenses, then get the
estate out of the courts. She made
this statement on. the stand In Judge
Coffey's department yesterday when
giving her reasons for opposing the
petition for a partial distribution* of
$57,000 and interest to A. J. Treat
Four of the Sutro children ' gave as
signed claims to one-flfth of certain
legacies to Treat, who was represented
by Garret. McEnerney. J. C. McKlns
try appeared for Dr. Merritt, who was
questioned by Mr.' McEnerney. â¢
The executrix said that she had
591,000 on hand and believed that the
distribution* should not "be 1 . made. She
thought she should retain $20,000 for
contingent expenses of the estate,
512,000 for taxes and $15,000 for ne
cessary repairs to the bulkhead at the
Sutro baths. "If, instead Â¦Â¦ ot asking
for a little money now," said Dr. Mer
ritt, "they would wait until the es
tate gets in good condition they would
receive much more. I believe the
mortgage of $308,000 to the Hibernia
Bank should be paid off, the estate
taken out of the courts, and then it
would not run behind." She said that
the income last year had been $79,000
and the expenses $104, C00. The es
tate is now running behind ' about
$2000 a month. She' thought that the
$400,000 worth .of property sold be
fore 1902 was sacrificed, and that the
sales this year .did not bring what
the land was worth. Had she been
free to decide, she would not have
sold it.
At this point a claim was put in
in behalf of Charles Sutro for . inter
est due on legacies which have been
paid, as a prior claim to that of
Treat. Mr. McEnerney then sug :
gested that the courU allow $70,000
out of the Â¦ $91,000 to. be prorated
among the six children; but Mr. Mc-
Kinstry insisted that the- remainder
would be inadequate to' the needs of
1 the estate. Thereupon Judge Coffey
ordered that $45,000 should .be di
vided among the six.
Dr. Merritt stated that the value
of the" property not included in the
charity trust is more â¢ than one and
one-quarter million dollars.

The first step la the treatment of the
chronic forms Is to remove the scales
and crusts and soften the skin, by
warm baths with Cnticura Soap. The
â¢calp, ears, elbows, hands, ankles and
feet will require frequently a thorough
soaking in order to penetrate the thick-
ened skin and crusts with which these
parts are often covered. Dry care-
fully, and apply Cutlcura Ointment,
lightly at first, and where advisable
spread it on pieces of soft cloth and
bind 1b place. Take the Resolvent,
pills, or liquid. In medium doses. Do
not use cold water in bathing, and
avoid cold, raw winds.
