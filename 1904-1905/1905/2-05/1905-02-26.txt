CHAPTER I.
<y* S the train stopped for the
f || sixth time, Clive descended
(â¢H abruptly.
1 "1 think I'll walk the rest
A of the way," he said to the
couductor. "Just look after my port
manteau, will you '.' and set that it is
left at Yorba with my boxee."
"O X," said the man. "But you
must like talking."
Clive had spent seven days on thÂ«
ocean, three in the furious energy of
New York, and six on a transcontinen
tal train, whose discomforts made him
wonder if he had a moral right to
enter the embarrassing state of mat
rimony with a temper hopelessly
soured. As he had come to Califor
nia to marry, and as his betrothed
was at a hotel in the northern red
woods, he did not pause for rest in
San Francisco. He left, two hours
after his arrival, on a narrow Â«*iuge
train, which dashed down precipitous
mountain slopes, shot rocking from
side to side, about curves on a road
6o narrow that the brush scraped the
windows, or the eye looked down into
the blackness of a canyon, five hun
dred feet below; raced shrieking
across trestles which seemed to
swing midway between heaven and
earth; only to slacken, with protest
ing snort and jerk, when climbing to
some dizzier height. Clive had stood for
an hour on the platform, fascinated
by the danger and the bleak solemnity
of the forests, whose rigid trunks
and short, stiffly pointed arms looked
as if they had not quivered since
time began. But he felt that he had
had enough, moreover, that he had
not drawn an uncompanioned breath
since he left England. If he was not
possessed by the graceful impatience
of the lover, he reminded himself
that he was tired and nervous and
had been obliged to go dirty for six
days â enough to knock the romance
out of any man; the Ã¼biquitous hu
man animal had talked incessantly for
sixteen days, and his legs ached for
want of stretching.
A twisted old man with a sharp eye,
a rusty beard deepening aimlessly
from a thin, tobacco-stained mouth,
limped across the platform, rolling a
flag. Clive asked him if he â¢ could
get to the Yorba Hotel on foot.
The man stared. "Well, you be an
Englishman, I guess," he remarked.
"Yes, I am an Englishman," said
Clive, heartily.
"Oh, no offense, but the way you
English do walk beats us. We ain't
none too fond of walkin' in Californy.
Too many mountains, I guess. Yes,
you kin walk it, and I guess you'll
have to. There goes your train.
Stranger in these parts?"
"I arrived In California to-day."
"So. Goln* to raise cattle, or just
sein' the wonders of the Gold
State?" i
"Will you kindly point out the way?
And I should like to send a dispatch
to the hotel, if possible."
i. sutenly. We don't think much
of English manners in these parts, I
don't mind sayin'. You English act
as if you owned God Almighty when
you rome out here. You forget we
licked ye twice. Come after a Californy
heiress ?"'
Clive felt an impulse to throw the
man over the trestle, then laughed.
"I beg your pardon," he said, "I
am sorry my manners are bad, but the
truth is my head is tired and my legs
are not. Come, show me the way."
Being further mollified by a silver
dollar, the old man replied graciously.
"All right, Fir. Just amuse yourself
while I send your telegram and fetch
a dark lantern. You'll need it. The
moon's doin' well, but the tops of
them redwoods knit together and are
as close as a roo*."
Cllve walked idly about the , little
waiting-room. The wails were decor
ated with illustrated weekly news

eofteninsr influence of the weekly ar
tist,- as if sculptured from mush,

"Who is Miss , Belrr.ont?" he asked,

"Oh, she's one of the heiresses.
That's our high-toned society paper.
It's prirtin* a series of Californy heir
esses. One of the other papers says
as how it's a good guide book for
impecr.onious furriners, and I guess
that's about the size of it. She's got
a million, and nobody but an aunt,
and she has her own way, I â tell â
you. She'll be a handful to manage;
but. somehow, although she keeps
people talkin', they don't believe as
much harm of her as of some that's
more quiet. You'll meet her, 1 guess,
if you're goin' to stay at Yorba, for
she's got a big house in the redwoods
and knows a lot of the hotel folks
and the Bohemian Club fellers. I like
her. She rides this way once a year
or so, and we have a yood chin about
politics. She knows a thing or two,
you bet, and she believes In Grover."
"How old is she" And why doesn't
she marry?" asked Clive idly, as
they walked up the road.
"She's twenty-six, and she's goin'
to marry â a Noo York feller; one of
them with Dutch names. She's had
offers, 1 {moss. Three of your lords,
I know of. But lords don't stand
much show with Californy girls â them
as was raised here, anyhow. They
don't give, a damn for titles, and they
scent a fortune-hunter before he's oft
the dock. They've put their heads
together and talked him over before's
he's registered. This Dutchman's got
money, so I guess he's all right. Be
you a lord?"
"I am not. I am a barrister, and
the son of a barrister."
"What may that be?"
"I believe you call it lawyer out
here."
"O â h â h â a lawyer's a gay bird,
ain't he? And don't he have a good
time?" The old man chuckled.
"I never found them different from
other men. What do you mean?"
"Ours are rippers. I've been in
Californy since '49, and I could spin
some yarns that would make your
hair curl, young man. Lord, Lord,
the old ones were tough. The young
ones ain't quite so bad, but they're
doing their best."
"California is rather a wild place,
isn't it?"
"It was. It's quietin' down now,
and it aJn't near so interestin'. Jack
Belmont, that there young lady's
father, was a lawyer when he first
come here, but he struck it rich in
Con. Virginia, in '74. and after that
warn't he a ripper. Oh. Lord! He
was a terror. But he done his duty
by hie girl; had her eddicated in Paris
and Noo York, and never let no one
cross her. He was as fine lookin'
a man as I ever seen, almost as tall
and clean made as you be, and awful
open-handed and popular, although a
terrible enemy. He's shot his man
twice over, they say, and I believe it.
His wife died ten years before him.
She was fond of him, too, poor thing,
and he made no bones about bein' un
faithful to her â they don't out here.
A man's no good if you can't tell a
yarn or two about him. Well, Jack
Belmont died five years ago and left
about a million dollars to his girl.
He'd had a long sight more, but she
was lucky to git that. They say as
how she was awful broke up when he
died."
"You're a regular old chroniqua
scandaleuse," said Clive, much inter*
ested. "What sort of a social position
has this Miss Belmont? Is she re
ceived ?"
"Received? Glory, man â why, her
father was a Southern gentâMary
land, as I remember, and her mother
was from Boston. They led society
here in the sixties; they're one of the
old families of Californy. That's the
reason Miss Belmont does as she
damned pleases, ~nd nobody dares say
boo â that and the million. She's an
cient aristocracy, she is. Received 1
Oh, Lord!"
Clive. much amused, asked, "What
does she do that is so dreadful?"
"Oh, she's been engaged about fif
teen times; she rides about the coun
try in boy's clothes, and sits up all
night under the trees at Del Monte
talkin' to a man. or gives all her
dancos to one man at a party and
then cuts him the next day on the
street; and when she gets tired of
people comes up here without even
her aunt. She used to run to fires,
but she gave that up some years ago.
She travels about the country for
weeks without a chaperon, and once
went camping alone with five
men. Sometimes she'll fill her
house up with men for a
week, and not have no other
woman, savin' her aunt. Lately she's
more quiet, they say, and has become
â i terrible reader. Last winter she
stayed up here for three months alone.
I hear as how people talked. But I
di-in't nee nothin'. She's all right, or
ray name atn't Jo Bagly. Well, here
you are, sir. Good' luck to ye! Keep
to the road and don't strike off on any
of them side trails, and you can't go
wrong. Evenin'."
Clive went into the dark forest.
What the old man had told him of
Miss Belmont had quickened his- im
agination, and he speculated about
her for some moments; then his
thoughts wandered to his English
betrothed. He had not seen her for
two years. Her mother's health fail
ing, her father had taken his family
to Southern California. A year later
Mrs. Gordon had died and her hus
band, having bought a ranch in which
he was much interested, had written
to Clive that he wanted his eldest
daughter for another year; by that
time her sister would have finished
school and could take her place as
head of the household. Lately he
and Mary had felt the debilitating
influence of the southern climate and
had gone to the redwoods of the

north. There Clive was to meet them,
remain a few weeks, then marry in
San Francisco and take his wife back
to England.
Clive was 34, ten years older than
Mary Gordon. He recalled the day
he had proposed to her. She had
come down the steps of her father's
house in a blue gown and garden
hat and they had gone for a walk in
the woods. She wai not a clever
woman, and she had only the white
and pink and brown, the rounded
lines of youth, no positive beauty of
face or figure; but with the blind
instinct of his race he had turned
almost automatically to the type of
woman who, time out of mind, has
produced the strong-limbed, strong
brained men that have made a nation
insolently great. She reminded him
of his mother, with her even sweet
ness of nature, her sympathy. her
kirge maternal suggestion. He had
known her since her early girlhood
and grown fonder of her each year.
She rested him, and had the divine
feminine faculty of making him feel
a better and cleverer man than he was
in the habit of thinking himself else
where.
She had accented him with the
sweetest smile he had even seen, and
he had wondered If other men were
as fortunate. For two years he saw
much of her. then she went to Amer
ica and he had plunged into his
work and his man's life, not missing
her as consistently as he had expect
ed, but caring for her none the less.
The Saturday mall brought him, un
intermlttingly, a letter eight pages
long, neatly written, and describing in
detail the daily life of her family
and of the strange people about tnem.
They were calm, affectionate, Interest-
Ing letters, which Clive enjoyed and
to which he replied with a hurried
scrawl, rarely covering more than one
page. An Englishwoman does not ex
pect much, but Mary occasionally
hinted sadly that a longer letter
would make her happier; whereupon
his conscience hurt him and he wrote
her two pages.
J%e enjoyed these two years, despite
hard work; he was popular with men
and women, and much was popular
with him that adds to the keener
pleasures of life. "When the time
came to pack his boxes and go to
America be puffed a large, regretful
rack from his last pipe of freedom;
but it did not occur to him to ask
release. For the matter of that, al
though he had come to regard Mary
Gordon as the Inevitable rather than
the desired, he had felt for her the
strong tenderness which such men
feel for such women, which endures,
and never in any circumstances turns
to hate.
After a time Clive extinguished the
lantern; it illumined the road fit
fully, but accentuated the dense
blackness of the forest. The under
growth was too thick to permit him to
stray aside, and he wanted to form
some idea of his surroundings. His
eyes accustomed themselves to th*?
dark. Moon rays splashed or trickled
here and there through lofty cieft and
mesh. Clive paused once and looked
up. The straight trees, sometimes*
Blender, sometimes huge, were as in
flexible as granite, an unbroken col
umn for a hundred feet or more; then
thrusting- out rigid arms from a ta
pering trunk into another hundred
feet of space. The effect was that of
a dense forest suspended in air, sup
ported above the low brush forest on
a vast irregular colonnade, out of
whose ruins it might have sprung.
Clive had never known a stillness so
profound, a repose so absolute. But
it was not the peaceful repose of an
English wood. It suggested the heavy
brooding stillness of archaic days,
when the uneasy world drowsed be
fore another convulsion. There was
some other Influence abroad In thÂ«Â»
woods, but at thi3 time its meaning
eluded him.
Suddenly it occurred to him that
he could not see Mary Gordon in this
forest. There was an irritating in
congruity in tl\e very thought. 3ha
belonged to the sweet, calm beech
woods of. England; nothing In her
was in consonance with the storm and
stress, the passion and fatality which
this strange country suggested. Did
the women of California fit their
frame? He experienced a strong de
sire for the companionship of a wo
man w'uo would interpret this forest
to him. then called himself an ass
and strode on.
An hour later he became aware of a
distant and deep murmur. It was
crossed suddenly by a wild, hilarious
yen. Clive relit the lantern anÂ»t
flashed it along the brush at his right.
Presently he came upon a narrow
trail. The prospect of adventurÂ«
after sixteen days of civilized monot
ony lured him aside and he walked
rapidly down the bypath. In a few
moments he found himself on thÂ»
edge of a large clearing. The moon
poured in without let and revealed a
scene of singular and uncomfortable
suggestion.
In the middle of the space waa
huge' funeral pyre; beyond It. evl
dently on a bier, Clive could see th
stony, upturned feet of a mammot
corpse, lightly covered with a whit
pall. Between the pyre and th
trees nearer him a large caldro
swung over a heap of fagots, whic
were beginning to crackle gently
The place looked as if about to be th
scene of some awful rite. Englishme
are willing to believe anything abou
California, and who had com
manded the admiration of his father
colleagues with his clear, quick, logl
cal brain, leaped at once to the con
elusion that this part of Californ
was still the hunting-ground of th
Red Indian and that some mighty
chief ; â¢â â â¢as about to be cremated, while
his widow, perchance, sacrificed' her
self ;in the ' caldron. â ' "
s.sHe'i plunged ! -' his hands into â¢ nl9
pockets and awaited developments with
the nervous delight of -<a ~ schoolboy.
â¢ Although. the forest was silent- again
he had an uneasy sense of many hu
man beings at no great 'distance. Â»'
He had ; not long to / wait. ' -There
was a sudden red glare, which made "
â¢the :- aisles -of the â¢. forest * seem ' alive

â i pelled. The two . hundred : torchbear
era who came after wore. the ordinary
; outing clothes of * civilization. *.'.â¢"".: '::
â  .This* strange procession marched
slowly round the ! circle, passing-peri
lously close to Clive. Then the priest :
' and acolytes * walked , solemnly â¦ up -(to
I the caldron, the ; â¢ others - dispersing '%*â 
â > themselves \ irregularly. > leaping occa
sionally and waving their torches.- .The
fagots ; were blazing; :CHve^fancied he
heard -a",' merry bubbling. . A y mo-^
ment of ;s~ profound < silence. t ? Then^
? the priest dropped something. Into .thaSa
caldron, chanting jan invocation otM

J languages. ;'â The i acolytes . and. -tore h^
â¢ bearers tossed to â¢ the : priest a entitle*!^
'and* Imaginations, which ha droppe^Hwith much ceremony into the caldron,
to the accompaniment of hollow, not
to say ribald, laughter and jests which
had a strong flavor of personalities.
The prologue lasted ten minutes.
Then the mummers crowded back
ward and faced the pyre. Again the
heavy silence fell. The priest went
forward and. raising his clasped
hands and set face to the moon,
stood, for a moment, like a statue on
â  monument, then turned slowly and
beckoned. The acolytes formed in
line and marched with solemn preci
sion to the other side of the pyre.
A moment later they reappeared,
walking with halting steps, their
heads bowed, chanting dismally. On
their shoulders they carried a long
bier, on which, apparently, lay the
corpse of a dead giant. The priest
sprinkled the body, then turned away
with a gesture of loathing. The aco
lytes carried it by the torchbearers,
who spat u>on and execrated it; then
slowly and laboriously mounted ths
pyre and, dropping the bier on its
apex, scampered indecorously down
with savage grunts of satisfaction,
their, white garments fluttering along
the dark yile iikÂ«i a wash on a windy
day. The corpse lay long and white
and horrid under the beating moon
and the flare of torch. As the aco
lytes reached the ground the rest Of
the company rushed simultaneously
forward and, with a hideous yell,
flung: their torches at the pyre. There
was the hiss of tar. the leap of one
great Came, an angry crackling. A
moment more and the forest would
be more vividly alight than it had
ever been at noonday. Clive, feeling
as uncomfortable as an eavesdropper,
but too fascinated to retreat, stepped
behind a large redwood. With his
eyeÂ» still fixed on the strange scene
he did not pick his steps and coming
suddenly In contact with a pliable
body, he nearly knocked it over. There
was a smothered shriek, followed by a
suppressed but forcible vocative.
Cllve mechanically lifted his hat.
"I beg your â¢ pardon," he said, ad
dressing a tall lad. whose face was
partly concealed by the visor of a cap.
"I hope I have not hurt you."
"I am not so easily hurt," said the
lad, haughtily.
The masculine man never lived who
did not recognize a feminine woman
in whatever guise. If within the ra
dius cf her magnetism. This young
masquerader interested Clive at once.
Her voice had a warm huskiness. The
mouth and chin were classically cut,
but very human. She had thrown
back her head and revealed a round,
beautiful throat. The loose -flannel
shirt and jacket concealed her figure,
but even the slight motions she had
made revealed energy and grace.
Clive offered her a cigarette. She
accepted it and smoked daintily,
withdrawing as much as possible into
the shadow and shielding her face
with her hand. He leaned back
against the tree and lit a cigar.
"What on earth is the meaning of
this scene?" he asked.
"That is the great midsummer jinks
ceremony of the Bohemian Club. They
have it every year and never invite
outsiders. So 1 was bound I'd see it,
anyhow."
"I wonder you don't become a
member." , '
"Oh, I'm- too young," promptly.
"Tell me more about it. What do
these ceremonies mean?"
â "Oh, they put all sorts of things
into that caldron â the liver of a
grasshopper with one of Harry Arm
strong's jokes; the wasted paint on
somebody's last picture with the mis
shapen feet of somebody else's latest
verse. The corpse is an effigy of Care,
and they are cremating him. Now
they'll be happy â that is to say, drunk
â till morning, for Care is dead. I'm
going to stop and see it out."
"I think yc-u had better go home."
"Indeed?" Clive saw tne hand that
â¢shielded her face Jerk.
"Did you ever see, or rather hear a
lot of men on a lark when they fancied
that no women were about?"
"No; but that is what I wish to do."
"Which you are not going to do to
night."
There was a sudden snapping of dry
leaves.
A small foot had come down with
emphasis.
"What do ram mean?"
"That this is no place for a woman,
and that you must go."
â¢â¢I'm not â well. I am, and I don't care
in the least whether you know it or
not. I wish you to understand, sir,
that 1 shall stay here, and that I am
not in the habit of being dictated to."
"You are Miss Belmont, I suppose."
An instant's pause. Then she re
plied, with a haughty pluck which de
lighted him: "Yes, I am Miss Bel
mont, and you are an insolent English-
"How do you know that I am an
Englishman?"
"Any one could tell from your voice
and your overbearing manner."
"Well, I am," said Clive, much
amused.
"I detest Englishmen."
"Smoke a little, or I am afraid you
will cry."
She obeyed with unexpected docility,
but in a moment crushed the coal of
her cigarette on a damn, tree stump.
Then she turned to him and folded her
arms.
"I am not going to leave," she said
evenly. "What are you going to do
about it?"
"How did you get here?"
I "On my horse."
"Where is he?"
"Tethered off the road."
"Very well; if you are not en that
horse in rive minutes. I shall carry
you to it, and what is more, I shall
kiss you."
She deliberately moved into the light
and pushed her cap to the back of her
head, disarranging a mass of curl
ing dark hair. Her coloring was in
definable in the red light, but her eyes
were large and long, and heavily
lashed. They sparkled wickedly. The
nostrils of her finely cut nose were
dilating; . her short upper lip was lift
ed. Clive ardently hoped that she
would continue to defy him. Her whole
attitude was that' of a young worldling,
delighting in an unforeseen adventure.
"Who are you anyhow?" she de
manded, "Of course I could see at once
that you were a gentleman, or I shotsjd
not have taken the slightest notice of
you." Â«tÂ» .. ~
"Thanks. My name is Owin Clive."
"Oh, you are Mary Gordon's friend,
that she has been expecting."
"Miss Cordon is an old friend of
mine." He half consciously hoped that
Miss Belmont did not know c-f his en
gagement. ...
" "She says you are frightfully ; hand
some." ;. .
Clive .laughed. "I cannot imagine
Miss Gordon using any such expres
sion; but then she has been two years
in California."
"I suppose Englishmen can't help
being. rude. I remember exactly what
she said, and she said it BO slowly and
Placidly. 'Oh. yes, dear Miss Belmont;
I think our men are very fine looking,
indeed.' (I ' had ' been- blackguarding
them.). 'My friend Mr.' Clive, of Â» whom
you nave heard me speak, is quite the
handsomest! man 1 have ever seen."
. "That sounds mere like it. And that
is exactly what she would have ; said
two years ago. ' .' I mean.'k laughing with :
some' embarrassment, "the way she
would, have" expressed herself." -
"Ob, 1 ' suppose : you are a ' mass '.of
vanity;' all men are. Yes; your Mary
Gordon is ; as English as if she had
never left Hertfordshire.: And always
will pe. She hasn't â  a spark of orig
inality." SBSS^BBg|
Clive discerned her purpose, but he '
replied coldly. -"Say rather that â  she
has Individuality.*,' .*'. â¢ t
"Which she hasn't,- and you know it.
I have that Do you think there is
much in common between us?"
"How can I tell after knowing you
ten minutes?"
' I can't get a rise out of ytni, I see.
You Englishmen are such phlegmatic
creatures. 1 don't believe there is a
spark of impulse left in your island."
"You arc a very brave young
woman."
"Why?" She drew her eyelashes to
uetht-r, shooting furth audacity.
"Do you want me to kiss you?"
The muscles of her face twitched an
grily.
"An Englishman's only idea of wit is
impertinence."
"What have Englishmen done to you
that you are so bitter? I don't believe
those lordlings I luive heard oi pro
posed, after all,"
"They did," replied Miss Belmont
emphatically, and quite . restored.'
"Every last one of them. 1 made Dyne
bor fetch and carry, like a trained. dog.
It was great tun. I used to say, b3
fore a room full of peupte. 'Go get my
fan, little man; 1 leit it with Charley
Rollins in the conservatory.' And he
would trot off; he was that hard up,
poor thins!"
"I am glad you did not marry any
of them; 1 am sure they were not good
enough for you."
"How polite of you. Why don't you
step out and let me sec you?"
"My vanity will not permit. I feel
cure that your remarkable frankness
would not aliow you to disguise your
disappointment."
"Weli, l shall se you on Sunday. You
are coming with Miss Gordon to dine
with me. She has accepted lor you."
"1 shall wait until then. I look bet
ter in evening clothes and when 1 am
clean."
"I like your voice and your figure,
Â«md you certainly have <i remarkable
amount of magnetism," she said medi
tatively. "Good heavens! what a row
those idiots are making. And do look
at that bonfire. It looks for all the
world as X the earth had run its
tc-ngue out at the moon."
Clive wondered why he did not kiss
her. He certainly wanted to, and he
certainly would have been justified. He
recalled no other attractive woman
who would have had to offer half the
encouragement with which Miss Bel
mont had recklessly toyed. A man
who coined epigrams for sale had once
said of him; "Clive is thoroughbred; he
can drink the strongest whisky, smoke
the blackest cigars, and he never fails
to kiss a pretty woman when the op
portunity oilers." And yet, so far,
sornc-thir.g about Miss Belmont stayed
him. He had no intention that it
should endure, however.
The scene was growing more and
more picturesque. Behind them was a
great roar, crossed by the howling and
yelling of two hundred and twenty-one
abandoned throats. The remotest aisles
of the forest were crimson. Every
needle of the delicate young redwoods,
every waving frond was etched min
utely on the red transparency. The
thousand columns with their stark
capitals wore a softened and gracious
sspecti albeit the general effect of the
night was infernal. .
"Are you going?" asked Clive.
N â â ." She curled her lips defiantly
away from her teeth.
"live crossed the short space between
tn-m with one step, lifted her in his
arms and walked rapidly up the trail.
F*or a moment she was too stupefied to
protest; then she attempted violently
to free herself.
"What do you mean?" she cried
furiously. "Do you know who I am?
I am in the habit of doing exactly as I
please. Everybody knows me, here. If
you have misunderstood me it's be
cause you are a thick-headed English
man, used to women who- are either
stupid or bad."
"You mean that the men you sur
round yourself with are idiots who per
mit you to play with them as you
( noose. Keep quiet. Don't you see
that you can't get away? If you strug
gle 1 shall hurt you. and I don't want
to do that."
"I have sat up all night with men
and they have never dared to kiss me,
however much they may have want
ed to."
"Then they were rotters, and you can
teli them so, with my compliments. If
1 sat up all night with you, I should
kiss you, and several times."
"Well, you never will:"
Thty reached the road. She stiffened
suddenly and tried to spring out of his
arms. He placed her on. her feet and
grasped her firmly by the shoulders.
"Now,** he said, "kiss me, and don't
be silly about it. If you go in for larks
of this sort you must take the conse
quences." She wrenched -"Â»ain. Ke
caught and held her so firmly tha,. she
could not Mrupt^le.
"You brute wi an Englishma*n," she
gasped.
Clive clasped his hand about the low
er part of her face and lifted it gently.
Ap he did so he shifted his position and
the light, for the first time, shone full
on his face. The girl oecame suddenly
quiet. Something leaped into her eyes
which his own answered. But as he
bent his face, she moved her head
backward aiong his shoulder.
"Please, please, dent," she said be
seechingly. "Oh. please, don't."
("live let her go. He walked with
her to the horse, helped her mount, and
watrhed her dash away.
"What a stupid ass I am," he
thought. "Why on earth didn't I kiss
that woman?"
He walked up the road for a few mo
ments, then turned and made for the
clearing.
The Dames were still leaping sym
metrically upward into a dense column
of smoke, the men still dancing about
the pyre, their enthusiasm unabated.
As Clive suddenly appeared in their
midst an Immediate and disagreeable
sil-i:re fell. Clive had never felt so
ur.< omfortable in his life. He con
cealed a certain amount of natural
shyness under a haughty bearing,
which would have repelled strangers
had it not been for his charm of ex
;on, the quick laughter of his
eyes.
"Does Mr. Charles Rollins happen to
be here?" he asked stiffly. "I have
brought a letter to him. My name is
Clive. I have an apology to make. I
stun. bled upon your strange ceremony
and watched it, not knowing at the
time that there was anything private
about it "
"Dent mention it. Don't mention
it," cried a hearty voice. A young
man pushed forward from the back of
the circle and grasped his hand. "I
had a letter from Stanley and hoped
you would get here in time for this.
You can n.ake up for being late only
by drinking six quarts cf fizz between
now and sunrise. Boys, come up and
shake."
Clive's hand was shaken, with a
solemnity which at first embarrassed,
then amused him, by every man pres
ent. Then solemnity vanished, and
with it any lingering remnant of
Clive's shyness.
The odor of savory viands mingled
with burning pitch and the subtler per
fumes of the forest. A great table was
spread. Champagne corks flew. Be
fore an hour \v;:s dene, Clive was voted
the liveliest Englishman, that had ever
set foot in California, and elected off
hand an honorary member of the Bo
hemian Club.
CH AFTER 11.
At 4 o'clock Clive once more started
for Yorba. He had not drunk six
quarts of champagne, but he had com
manded the respect of his comrades by
the courage with which he had mixed
his drinks. Rollin-. had held
his head under a waterfall, in the little
river, but it still felt very large. He
took off his straw hat and looked at
it resentfully. Why had he not worn
his traveling: cap? He also felt de
pressed, and reproached himself ye
hemently. What must Mary Gordon
think? Doubtless she was sitting up
waiting for him, and thought him dead
âmurdered. Nevertheless he had en
joyed himself thoroughly, and he found
remorse more coy than he would have
wished. He had an uneasy conscious
ness that if his head did not ache so
confoundedly he would not feel re
morse at all.
His thoughts wandered to Miss Bel
mont. "I believe I found the woman
for the forest, after all. I wonder if;
she would fit It as well now. Perhaps,
in another mood. I fancy she is ft
woman of many." â¢
The redwoods were dripping with
mist, itself as motionless as the silent
trees it shrouded. It filled every hol
low, was banked in every aisle, lay
like silver cobweb on the young red
woods and ferns. It emphasized the
.ghastly silence. Xot a bird was awake,
not a crawling thing moved. ,Once a
panther cried far upon the mountain,
but that was all. â 
CHve came upÂ»h the hotel an hour
later, a long rough wooden structure at
the foot of the mountain, up which
straggled many cottages. Hard by B
across a little creek, were a saloon and
billiard-room. As he ascended the steps,
a stout man with a red heavy face,
came out of the office, stretching him
self.
"You're Mr. Clive, the Gordons'
friend, I surmise," he said.
"1 tope they haven't sat up for me."
He devoutly hoped they had not.
"They ain't. Miss Gordon waited till
12, then concluded you'd fallen in with
the Bohemian Club, as she knowed
you'd brought ( a letter to Rollins. Jedg
ins by the looics of you, I should say
you had. Come over to the bar and
taper off. My name's Hart, and I run
this hole!."
"Thank you," said Clive grimly, "but
I'll have no more to-night. Be good
enough to show me to my room, and
be sure to have me wakened at S. I
suppose Mr. and -Miss Gordon are not
up before then. If they are, please
give thorn my compliments and tell
them that I did fall in v.ith the Bo
hemian Club."
CHAPTER 111.
When Clive awoke and looked at his
watch, it was a quarter to 3 in the
afternoon. He sprang out of bed in
dismay. He was an ideal lover! If
Mary Gordon sent him about his busi
ness he could not question the justice
of the act. After a hurried tub and
toilet he went in search of his land-
lord.
"Why in thunder didn't you call me
at 8?" he s asked I savagely. : '
â "Miss * Gordon f was tup % at '; -7,'S mister,
and she ' gave \ strict orders i that P you

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
you over to her cottage the minute
you show up, and to send a broiled
chicken after you."
"She's an angel," thought Clive, "and
will certainly make an Ideal wife."
He followed his host out of the hotel
and up tne hill. Tne summer gin in
pink and blue, sailor hat and shirt
waist, dotted the greenery; in rare in
stances attended by a swain. On the
piazzas of the hotel and cottages older
women knitted or read novels.
The day was very warm. The sun
shone down into the forest above and
about the cottages, where the trees
were not so densely planted as in the
depths. The under forest looked very
green and fresh. A creek murmured
somewhere. Bees hummed drowsily.
Clive's head still ached and he was
hungry; but at this moment he was
conscious of nothing but a paramount
wish to see Mary Gordon.
Mr. Gordon, a pink-iaced man with
white side- whiskers, was standing on
the piazza of a tiny cottage wnich
looked as U it had been ouiit in a
night. He winked at Clive as ne came
down and shook him hearthy by the
hand. He had loved his wife and been
kind to her, but had always done ex
actly as he pleased.
"She's insKie, ' lie whispered, "arui I
don't think she'll row you. Sorry it
happened, just vow it never will again,
and she'll torget it. ihey always do,
biess them!"
Clive went hastily into th* little
parlor. Mary Gordon was stanaing in
the middle of the room, her hands
tightly clasped, her eyes very bright,
her upper lip caught between her teeth.
Clive saw in a glance that she had
more style and grace of carriage than
when she had left England. Her hair
was more fashionaoiy arranged, and
altogether she was a handsomer girl.
He t /ok her in his arms and kissed her
many timts, and she cried softly on
his shoulder. He humbled himself to
the dust, and was told that he must
always do exactly what he wanted;
and he felt a distinct thrill of pleasur
able domestic anticipation, he had
been spoiled all his life, and would
have taken to matrimonial discipline
very unkindly.
When he nad eaten of the broiled
chicken and several other substantial
delicacies, and was at peace with him
seif and the world once more, he went
for a long walk in the forest with
Mary. After a time they sat down on
a log, and he lit his pipe and tried to
imagine an environment of English
oaks and beeches. Again and more
forcibly he felt the discordance be
tween the English girl, simplified by
generations of discipline and homo
geneous traditions, and this green
light, this strange brooding silence,
this vast solitude suggesting a new
world, a new race, an unimaginable
future â this hot, electric, sensuous air.
They talked of the past two years,
and of their future together.
"I have not told any one yet that
we are engaged," said Mary. "People
here don't seem to take things aa seri
ously as we do, and I comd not stand
being chaffed about it. I have merely
said that we expected an old and dear
friend of the family."
"I am glad. It's a bore to be
chaffed."
"Of course I have written to all our
friends in England that we are to be
married on the 12th; out as the wed
ding is to be so quiet, it is not neces
sary to tell any one here."
"How do you like this country?" he
asked curiously. "I mean how does it
suit you personally? Of course, I know
you would make up yojir mind to like
any place where duty happened to take
you, but you must have a private lit
tle idea on the subject, and it is your
duty to .tell me everything."
She smiled happily. " 'Well!' as they
say here, now that I am sure that
Edith will make papa comfortable, I
shall be glad enough to go back to
England. California doesn't suit me at
all. It rubs me the wrong way. I
think I should develop nerves if I
stayed here much longer. Americans
don't seem to me to be half human.
Helena Belmont says that America
will be the greatest nation on earth
when it gets a soul, but that it is noth
ing but a kicking, squalling, preeo
eious infant at present; and that if
some one were clever enough to stick
his finger in the so:'t spot on the top
bf its head, it would transform it into
an idiot or a corpse; but that America
â Â»v ill pull through all right because she
has so many weak points that her ene
mies forget which is the weaiwai. Miss
Belmont is so clever. You will meet
her* on Sunday. You don't mind my
having accepted an invitation for you
to dine there?"
"Not at all. It was very kind of
you, 1 am sure. I have heard ef this
Miss Belmont; I don't imagine you tind
much in common with her."
"She horrifies me, but she fascinates
me more than any person I have met
here. I am sure she is a good wom
an, in spite of the reckless things she
do>;s. Yo-ur friend, Mr. Rollins, says
that she is the concentrated essence
of California, and I always excuse her
on that ground. You never know what
she is going to do or say next and
she is the most desperat tlirt I ever
heard of. I suppose she is so beautiful
she can't help it. Her eyes always
seem to be looking at you through
tears, even when they are laughing or
flirting, although I don't believe she
sheds many. I cannot imagine her
crying, although I know her to be
kind-hearted, and generous, and im
pulsive."
"Do you call it kindhearted to throw
fifteen men over?"
"I told her once that I thought it was
morally wrong for her to lure men on
to such a terrible awakening, and she
said that there was just one thing
that man didn't know, which was
woman; and that it was her duty to
her sex to addle their brains on the
subject as much as possible. But I
want you to know me, Owin."
"The better I know you, the better I
shall live you."
"When yaur eyes laugli like that I
never know whether you are chaffing
me or not, It will not take long. f<-r
I am not clever"; she smiled a little
sadly. "You are so clever that I know
you will often want to go and talk Kb
women who know mo-re man I do; but
none of them will ever love you so
wejl."
"I know it," he said tenderly, and he
believed what he said.
"I am glad that I have been in Cali
fornia, though," pursued Mary. "It
has broadened me. i â¢ home we take
it for granted that all tne unconven
tional people bad, and all the con
ventional ones good. Here it is so dif
ferent; although I muse say that I
never heard so much petty gossip and
scandal in my life as there is in the
smart set in San Francisco. All visi
tors remark that: I suppose it is be
cause they have so little to do and
think about. It is very slow here so-
cially; and I suppose that is wtiat
makes some of the women do such out
landish things â that and the country,
for even the quiet ones are not ex
actly like other people. One can judge
for oneself. I have often pinned the
tattlers down when they were abusing
Helena Belmont. for instance, and they
couid not verify a single statement."
"Women know each other very lit
tle," said c:
CHAPTER IV*.
, He passed his nights in the Bohe
mian Club camp, his nontafi in bed,
the remaining hot; :.ng about
with his betrothed, and felt that alto
gether life was not understood by the
pessimists. England, with the strug
giefl and .-ibilities it
held in store for him. seemed to exist
only between the rusty covers of his
tory, and It- ;l thing to De dawdled
away in a wonderfaj forest, where the
very air made t man hate the thought
of all that was hard and ugly and too
serious. â¢
Clive waa something more than cu
rious to se* Miss Belmont again, but
hardly knew whether he ought to go
to her hoUi- * or not. It was possible
that the expected him to decline an
invitation proffered befcre an unpleas
ant adventure; but unless he pleaded
sudden illness he div not see his "way
out of acceptance. On Saturday, how
ever, Mary received a aate from the
chatelaine' of I'asa del Norte, remind
ing her of the dinner and of her prom
ise to brir.s Mr. Clive.
"Charley RoUtas tells me that he is
the best all-round Englishman he has
ever known," the note concluded; "not
the least bit of a cad. I am most
anxious to meet him."
Mary laughed as she handed the note
to Clive. If any other woman had
written that I'd never enter her house
again. But, somehow, you let her say
and do exactly what she chooses. The
trouble is that the only Englishmen
she has met have been fortune hunters.
When we are married I'll ask her over
to visit us, and let her meet men who
ar^ almost as perfect as you are. "
Clive said, "Yes, dear," absently.
Three clays of unshlftlng devotion had
blunted the tine point of his content.
The next day Mary waa prostrate
with one of the severe headaches to
which she was subject, and sent Clive
off with Charley. Rollins to the dinner.
Â»'.o, Â'... ma boy." Mr. Gordon had
said to him, when Clive had displayed
a decent amount of reluctance. "She'll
be too ill to be spoken to for twenty
four hours. You could do no good by
hanging round."
During: the hour's drive through the
redwoods Clive said to Rollins:
V.iv are great friend of Miss Bel
mont. are you not?"
"I am. ft i a fact."
"Have you known her long?"
She nearly scratched my eyes out
when-Shc was three and I five. I've
Bd red her ever since, and think the
D I've been able to hang on suc
eessfttÃy is because I've never pro
to her."
"I've heard several opinions of her.
and I'd like yours. I cant say that,
so far, I've met any one likely to
understand her. You should, particu
larly ad you have never made love to
her."
RoHlrsl half closed his shrewd, dark
Mlted his hat over his nose.
Like all San Francisco men, he looked
rsrclfsMj ili-i.sed, although in evening
clothes, and carried himself badly;
but his face was clear and refined, his
hair nnd beard trimly cut.
"Helena Belmont," he said, in what
the elur> (.alltii his "summing-up
vrice." "ha? the genius of Califoi ;
her. like Sibyl Sanderso. and a :
others I coold mention without stop
ping to chink, although they wnuM be
mere names to you. You see, it is
like this: all sorts of men came here
in early days â poor men of good fam
ily, who had failed at home, or I
too proud to work there; desperadoes,
adventurers, men of middle life and
broken fortunes â all of th :ti expecting
everything from the new land, and
ready 10 t-ar th^ h'-art out of any one
who got in their way. It was every
man for himself and the derU take
the hindmost. Many succeeded. Some
Of their methods will not bear the
fierce light of history. That m
spirit, that instinct to trample to a
goal over anything or anybody, that
intolerance or restraint, still lingers in
the very atmosr)her", and is quick in
the blood of many of the present gen
eration, slthc-a .igely enough,
it has given a distincter individuality
to the women than la the men. Of
eoarsei there are Californians and 'ali
fornians. It is always a mistake to
generalize too freely, but the type I
speak of is the most signili.-ant. al
cri'iush you will rind no Californian
exactly iik- ar.y othtf American. This
is the lard of the composite. All
America and all Plurope have emptied
themselves into it. God knows what
it will sift down to eventually- the
commonplace, probably. Aa for Hel
ena Belmont, Jack Belmont, her father,
came here in the fifties and hung up
his shingle. He was one of the clever
est lawyers the State has had. He
rarely drew v 6a*sM breath, and was
never seen to stagger; he was an in
veterate gambler and a terror with;
women. He married a Miss Lowell
of Boston, whs came out here on" a
visit â a beautiful girl; and God knows
what she (rent through with him. You
may be surprised that she married
him. I nr;y have given you the im
pression that he was a cowboy in a
red shirt and sombrero. Jack Bel
mont was one of the most elegant
men this State has ever seen, a gentle
man when he was drunkest, and the
f th. Southern set, a strong con
tingent here. There you have the ele
ments of which Helena Belmont is
made ud. She has the blood of Cava
liers and Roundheads in her veins;
she grew up amidst the clash of tha
South against the North, for no two
people could ever have been more
unmated than her mother and father;
and she was born in California, nur
tured on its new savage traditions,
and mentally and tempernmen tally
fitted to draw in twice her measure
of its atmosphere. She does what she
pleases, because she would never know
if she were beaten, has a tremendous
personality and "a mi'.aon dollars.
Here v.c are."
CHAPTER V.
The forest had ended abruptly.
They had coma upon a large low
adobe house on a plateau, looking
down over a shelving table-land upon
the ocean, a mile below.
"It's about eighty years old." said
Rollins, "which is antique in this
country. It \> to one of the
grandees of the old time, and Miss
Belmont bought it shortly after her
father's death. She has ac
houses, but this is her favorite. It
has about thirty there

here. I can tell you. Those are the
original tiles and thj original walls.
but everything tlse has oeen pretty
well modernized, except that old or

They dismounted at an open gate

a forge orderless garden. The air was

THE TALE OF A PACK-TRAIN
LOUISE
WEAVER
THE Western sun poured a flood of
dear, speckless light down the
long parting between the moun-
JL tain slopes. On either side red
woods, flrÂ£. spruces, close-packed, rose
to the crests of the ranges, while down
the river to the west, nanking the sun's
pathway, crowding, timber-clad ridges
faded away- -Into jagged, purple dis
tances.
A faded, false-fronted store, with a
high porch, a blacksmith shop and two
dwellings spread their rustic, rambling
shapes on the level and unlevel be
tween the meetings of the hills.
Billy Williams stood below the store
porch taking off the packs and pack
saddles from the back? if twenty-three
mules. Twenty-four of the sturdy, ill-,
tempered beasts had formed the train
in the morning.
As he tossed the bundles of picks and
shovels, the kegs of powde. and colls
of fuse, the sacks of flour and slabs of
bacon in a pile alcng the edge of the
porch, through the open store door
Billy could hear Bcastr. his boss, tell
ing Brown, the blacksmith, in graphic,
lorceful language how another mule
and pack had gone down the bank on
the dangerous River Trail.
He was saying, "By gum. Billy'd bust
up a millionaire at the rate he's going â
two Bales in five month
Billy could not hear Brown's reply,
but he had no difficulty in catching
Be&sly's next heated remark.
"It's no use. Luck's dead agin him.
"Well, no; I don't know as he's to blame,
but when Luck gets a man up a stamp
be Might as well quit, and, by cracky,
if he looses another one before th* year
is out I'll lire him."
The red Mood of anger and chagrin
surged up over Billy's face and burned
darkly in his" cheek?, for out of the- tail
of his eye he eouid see Charley Chirm,
the other pack-driver, leaning against
the door-jamb smoking and listening
to every word that was said.
At the gleam of satisfaction which
shot over that smiling' "face up there
above him Billy's Ire rose. It would
have given him a savage joy to strike
the chance to chew his rival.
Billy finished unpacking and drove
the mules down to the feed corral,
while his heart was hot within him.
He was not going to let the boss "are"
him â bo he told the mulesâ he'd jump
the job and let old .Beasly whistle for
a driver. It was not his fault that* that
rope slipped on that keg of nails and
threw the weight to one side and over
balanced that last mule. Guess the
boss wouldn't find it such ah easy mat
ter to Â»pick up a trusty man these
times. The next driver might not be
any luckier arid might slide' out with
th' whole caboodle to boot, then
where'd Bc-aely get off. /
As he tossed the pitchfork on' the
haymow a eoft."who-oo" came to him
from across .the narrow trail. . .
At sight ot the face above the pickets
of the little garden fence in front of
the low ranch l.ouse Billy's anger slid
from him as a /cloak slips unnoticed
from the shoulders to the ground.
It wag Bessie, old BeaSly's daughter.
Billy had forgotten her .while he cursed
h Â«â¢ luck' and Charley and old Beasly
and the mules' all in a bunch. ;
"The kitten has fallen into the well
and Johnny and 1 can't get her out."
she called to ; him. , , ' '"'â 
Billy strod^ acroes to; the ence, leap
ed over arid stood beside the girl.
Daintily winsome ehe looked as she
stood there in the late afternoon light.
â What made you so late . to-day,
Billy?" she asked he t followed her
up to the well. ' ',
"Oh," he answered slowly, "I played
on the way." 'j^^gWl^j^^^^S^^^
Fhe looked steadily up at him for an
Instant but said nothing* 5 then their
heads bent close together over the high
curbing. ' . . \ :/ , ' '
V. hen Billy let himself down into the
we.ll and brought up the dripping crea
ture, Bessie's face as she took the
wretched kitten from his pocket while
he still hung in the curbing, more than
repaid him. He was rather glad puss
fell into the well. -â -,â ..
And It was pleasant standing under
the pulley, drawing up bucketful after
bucketful of the water into .which the"
cat had taken her involuntary plunge
while Bessie chatted to him or turned
the trough to water the geranium Â»Â°ds.
Quite suddenly Bessie asked, "What
is it. Billy?" > .
"What what?" he asked in reply,
glancing inquiringly down at her.
Why. with you." she said, looking
searchingly at this tall pack driver.
"Nothing." he answered quietly,
resting the bucket on the curbing.
She looked at him evenly for a mo
ment, then with h"r head up she
turned and walked toward th 2 house.
"Wait." he called submissively, "it
wasn't anything only 1 just lost an
other mu'e to-day."
She watched his reddening cheeks for
a minute.
â¢ Don't do it; Billy." she cried softly.
"Do what," he asked.
"Why, quit the job as you've -been
thinking of doing." ."Well, why Hot?"
he asked.
"What!" she exclaimed, "and let
some one else, get ahead of you? I
would!" she cried scornfully.
"Bessie," he began in low soft tones
cs he caught her hand, but the slam
of the little garden sate startled them
and Ch^rlpy Chlhri with his hat on the
buck ef his head, his hands In his
pockets and the sneering smile still on
the corner of his Ifpa lounged toward
them between the geranium beds.'-
Billy bit his lip and swore roundly
under his breath. He turned and strode
away. He would not wait to "witness
the balancing of the score. Miss Bes
sie did it with such consummate skill
that the most Impartial observer could
not have told which of the two drivers
stood first.
Billy's train with Billy in the saddle"
of the hind mule pulled out for Willow
Springs the next, morning before the
Eun capped the/peaks that towered
abi/ve j the little hamlet, and he jingled
in and out regularly twice a week for
months, then' one trip the boy who rode
the lead mule was taken down , with
the measles' and Billy was left without

chance, and begged so hard for "just
this one trip" that Beasly, who del
nied the boy nothing, let him ga . ,
The next trip arid the next found the
boy astride Old Gray's back jogging
down the trail till Bessie was near
driven distracted with fear and worry
from the time the . little: fellow's. ; old
straw hat sank below : the ; banks down
the trail till it rose above them on his
return.
In the meantime Charley lost a mule
and then a pack till he had not so
much to brag over Billy, yet not a whit
of . the swagger dropped from his gait.
As for Billy, he never rode a trip that
he did not give* a sigh of relief when
his train was, safely landed. :/:; '
So ; the rivalry increased / and . each
smile of 'Bessie's' arid each successful

And so Billy's year drew to a close.

completed . his months of grace. . . ;

all the. long way down to Korbel, where ,
he was to load up with goods from ...
Eureka for the return trip. .'.,, % -. â¢
But for all that Billy could, not resist
a ring that, caught his eye in at the
watchmaker's where he went to get his
watch that evening. He was quite car- ;
ried away with two hands clasping
two hearts and bought .It " then â  and
, there, ' calling ..'himself a * fool all the
time he was doing it and doubting that

The second morning out from iKor- '

packs himself. Â He tried each rope and
strap' to ttst the strength of its fasten

I below. ; A long way down It was. Then 'Â».
he watched ; a buzzard* soaring round
and 'â - back and round again In the blue,
cloudless sky. Had somebody's mule 3
gone down the bank, he wondered,
:: that this creature was sailing about in
search of? ,-4,;... "'' / - -, \ :%?Â£
His eyes 1 roamed back to the mulus
in front, toiling on, /each with muzzle
close to ; the heels of j; the next, only a
step between, pacing steadily on to
the ting, ting-a-ling of the bell. A .
-long: string/ they made of dun and gray
and brown, their heads low with only
now ? and ; then a/pair ' of eara flapping /
above their packs. He watched the
creases roll up and disappear on old
Mike's hlpe. The old rascal kept fat,
if he did carry the heaviest load of
the lot.
Old Gray was past the middle 6f the
danger ground and Billy was beginning
to breathe freer a,nd to tell himself
that his last load was safe when with
a sudden jangle the bell ceased and
the whole train halted.
Bl!!y glanced ahead in wonder along
a lino of humpy bumpy packs, along
a line of nineteen or twenty patient
drooping; mules to where Old Gray, al-
Biott to the safety limit on the pines,
with three or four mules behind her,
stood with heads on high and ears
flung far forward snorting with fright.
Billy could see something black; he
could not make out what It was for
the mules' heads partly hid the object
in front of them.
Old Grey with the other three or four
turned on the instant and leaped and
plunged back on the animals behind
them and on each other.
Â« A rearing, a pounding of fore feet on
boxes and packs and shoulders, brays
of intense fear, through it all th^
clang-lang of the bell. The sudden fall
ing of four bodies, Old Gray in the
midst, the whirling, the tumbling,
packs up, heels up, the sudden final
bang of the bell, ftw sickening splash
below, all stunned Billy.
He sat and chewed the end of a
holly branch and thought how bitter
the bark was.
The open space made by the falling
mules disclosed to Billy and to several
more of the mules a black bear stand
ing on the trail.
Two more mules went down. The
clinging prolonging agony of slipping,
slipping, clinging with their fore feet
to the trail tore Billy with pity. He
waked to sense yie fact that, should
the bear come en, even If he remained
in his tracks, all the mules would go
down the precipice.
He whooped and shouted and popped
his quirt and swung his hat to frighten
the bear. He seized his horn and blew
a blast, the assembly, the reveille,
boots and saddles. He coaxed and ca
joled the mules.
"Easy, now; easy, old girl, no fear.
He's as much afald of us as we are of
him."
The next two or three mules were
backing and turning with noses out
and ears back. They trampled and
surged on the quivering animals be
hind them. A brown mass swung out
ward, paused an instant, down, down
it went like a shot. It was followed
by the next two or three that caught
sight of the bear.
Billy called and whistled and blew
his hern in frantic horror.
The crowding line settled back like
the jolting together of a train of cars.
The hindmost mules could not see the
bear, but they might soon be Â©hoved
off by the ones that could see him.
Suddenly Billy thought of Johnny.
"My God! where is the boy?"
He 6hc-uted, "Johnny, Johnny, are
you there?"
"Here, what are you stopping for?
Old Betsy, you are crowding me,"
came in Johnny's high voice.
For an Instant Billy sat numb with
fear. If those in front kept plunging
out into space, those behind would see
the bear and whirl to certain death be
low. Johnny was there between them.
Nothing could save him. If he were
not thrown off he would be trampled to
death.
The cold sweat broke out on Billy's
face.
The trail would be a blank without
Johnny Once he glanced down, think
ing the boy had surely gone; he could
see his red calico waist dashing down
the descent.
A strong sense of shame sweyt over
him as he thought of telling the boy's
folks at home.
Then the instant's torpor left him. He
knew what to do â the only thing left
to do.
He sprang up in the saddle and
crawled carefully over to the back of
the mule in front. The beast already
carried its full burden in its pack. He
must move with care, lesti the extra
weight cause It to sway outward, or,
worse still, to step back alnd fall off
the narrow footing. Straight over the
center of its back he crept; on to its
shoulders; over to the hips of the one
in front. This one moved slightly, and
Billy braced himself for a struggle.
The trail looked narrower than ever
as he glanced down at it.
On to the next he cautiously crept,
holding himself ever ready to make the
attempt to swins in to the empty
trail If the mule went down. The shov
ing and straining Increased, and John
ny's voice called in querulous, appeal
ing tones:
"Billy, Billy, old Betsy is squeezing
me to death. Make her get up."
"Yes, yes, Johnny; hold on Just a
minute. I'm coming," Billy shouted
confidently.
On over the next and the next he
made his way. When he reached
down from Tony's back and took hold
of Johnny's arm and tried to drag
him from between the mules he
couldn't move the boy.
"You hurt my arm." whined
Johnny.
"I must if I get you out," Billy ex
claimed, desperately
"Get up, there, Betsy. Go on: move
an Inch," he screamed, as he struck
her fiercely with his quirt. The blow
forced her forward and crowded the
next but one off the trail.
The sudden ceasing of the strain
almost threw Billy off Tony's back,
but he seized the mule's neck with
one arm and dragged Johnny up with
the other.
"Would it be sr.fe to stay with
'Tony?" Billy thought for a moment.
The boy was limp and fainting.
Billy glanced forward. The horrible
melee continued ever nearer sad
nearer.
He took Johnny under one arm and
crawled over the pack, reached out
and threw hia arm over the next
mule's neck, drew his burden on this
beast's shoulders, back over hia pack,
on to his hips. A jar from the back
ward struggling mules tipped him
toward the gulf below. He clung with
his heels to the mule's flanks.
He clutched at the roach of thÂ«
next animal and saved himself. Two
more he must clamber over before he
and Johnny were in safety at the end
of the line.
Over shoulders and packs and hips
in feverish haste yet ever slower
and slower he made his way.
His own mule backed a step and
stumbled as he slipped to the
trail safe at last.
He carried Johriffy back into the
elbow and laid him down in the
shade.
When Billy ran back to the males
but six were left on the trail and the
bear was nowhere in siyht.
Billy was stunned with his loss. He
stood and stared at the blank trail and
down at the swirling flood below him.
It had swallowed up eighteen of hto
twenty-four mules.
How could he tell them up at Beas
ley's? His fate wu sealed now. His
shimmery castles were shattered by
one tittle tap from Luck's gnarled,
scraggy sttck.
Besides his anguish for the loss of
the girl â which he now reit was a cer
taintyâstood his pity for his boss.
This last would almost ruin the old
man. He stood and looked blankly
down at. the waters that covered a Itt
tle fortune.
Then numb and heartsick he went
buck and aat down beside the boy till
the lad revivad.
Stolidly on behind the little retfinant
of the train they trndged, not yet trust-
Ing themselves \o Jack's back Hfl they
came to the pines, then Billy took
Johnny up behind htm.

BY AUGUSTA rRESCOTT.
Three orders for street gowns were
flashed by cable into the workrooms .
of Paris the other day. They were
from Fraultin Bertha Krupp. from
Wilhelmina. Queen of Holland, and
from the Princess Cantacuzene, niece
of Mrs. â  Potter Palmer. So three
women, German, Holland and Ameri
can, are to have spring walking suits
and all three will bear the trademark
of Paris. ...
Among the handsome actresses, v.ho
have sent in their orders are - Mrs. -
i William Faversham, Miss Maude Ad
' aas, who is as Tlressy as she' is pc- â¢
tite; Madame Kejene,- the tragedienne;
Mrs. Patrick Campbell and Madame -
t'arah -Bernhardt. The â  last, by the
way. is the despair -of her dressmak
ers, for ehe-Is very difficult to please,
and she- always wants something new .
and entirely different: "I must be dis
tinctive and original.^'- she says. * â¢ â¢
The street suits which are * being- *
turned out from the Paris workrooms
are handsome, but it can truthfully "*
be said, even after a study of their â¢"
'best points, that- they are no better 1 :
than those of homemake. They â¢: are â¢
not as neat as th- English tailor
made suits, nor : as â  elegant' as the"
American tailored garment. â â¢ True,
they are chic. But chic-ness is a qual
ity which is fast being acquired here. â 
One of the prettiest of the -spring *
styles is the coat and skirt style.- This
is immensely popular and what is bet
ter grows more and more so. It' is
very convenient to purchase a little
coat and skirt and .more than con
venient to wear the .suit with a pretty
shirtwaiFt underneath. . . .â  ...
"For spring," said a modiste, "I look
forward to the coat and skirt idea al
most exclusively. . True, t_rre is a great
deal of talk abou. the old-fashioned
basque and the bodice. But I look for
a Renaissance of the two-piece suit,

that it will be twice as popular as
ever.

expensive it is apt to be, for.it must be
elegantly cut and trimmed, and it must

It was Fraulein Krupp who on being
asked what she specially desired to
wear this season in society replied:
"An 1&30 grown made entirely of lace,"
and to this she added, "and a dozen all
lace shirt waists."
Mm Krupp'* Handsome Gowns.
The fraulein has a very handsome set
of Irish crochet laces made specially
for her and fitted to her gown, which is
of a pale, lovely silvery color. In thi3
set there is a deep pair of lace cuffs,
which are stiffened with whalebone or
some other good stiffening material.
And 'alon;; the edge of the cuffs there
was a delicate line of silvery satin. The
cuffs were lined with chiffon, the better
to display the fine lace.
Another lace set made for this young
woman was from the hand looms of
Italy. It vas v.ry fine, closely resem

bling the filet lace which is familiar
here. The darning in this case, or the
work in the center of the lace, was done
in silver and white raised work. And
there were cuffs and collar, yoke and
hip yoke, and a deep flounce for the
foot of the skirt. The skirt flounce
could be drai'ed or not, as it was mad-?
in points and was suitable for draped
flounce, or even for a paneling.
It was nretty Wilhelmina who re
euested that her spring gown be made
of red current cloth. The cloth is very
line, very light, very soft and elegantly
Edapted to spring use. The suit is to
be made with a three-quarter coat, cut
away in the front and finished with
rovers, smart cuff*. h ; gh shoulder puffs
and a lardown collar. It is a vory
smart coat and looks particularly well
over the rather plain skirt which is a
part of this suit. There are two skirts.
/â¢ne paneled in the front and made with
a semi-train, and the other plain and
of walking length.
Pansy color will be popular this
spring. It is a color that is neither a
purple nor a lavender, but which sug
gests the full-blown pansy in its soft
est, richest tonts. One can get a great
deal of wear out of a pansy cloth gown,
as it can be trimmed with one of many
colors and frequently changed. Green,
white, black, corn color and violet all
jjo well with pansy color.
There is a perfect fad for trimming a
gown in such a way that the trimming
:an be taken off and other trimmings
put on. A pansy colored gown can be
trimmed with new green. This makes
a very dressy suit with its gorgeous
green vest, while the hat has its
shaded green plume. Later in the sea
son the green can be removed and
white satin can be applied in its place.
Now there comes the white mu'.l. or
the white lawn shirt waist, or the shirt
waist of white nainsook, or of any deli
cate washable material.
Tailored Gowns Trimmed With Lace.
The spring suits will all be conspicu
ous by their uses of lace. Lace will
be used to make collor and cuffs, and
it will be used in every other way
possible to lace. And this is saying a
great deal, for the possibilities of lace
are wide and varied.
Perhaps the prettiest innovations for
the tailor-made gowns are found in the
lace cuffs which are now made rather
deep and edged on both ederes with
frills of chiffon and of organdie. One
can take the old pair of lace cuffs,
frill them along each edge and have
something as new as the most ap
proved voice of fashion could dictate.
The turnovers are as popular as ever
and perhaps one may say they are
more popular than ever, for they come
in greater variety and in every color.
Colored laces are impressed into the
service, and embroidered laces, and one
can buy turnovers that are marvels
in delicate handwork.
Skirts are simply glorious this spring,
though they are for the most part
short. Dressmakers who object to
butchering a velvet skirt, or one of
handsome cloth, will, sometimes, per
suade a woman to allow her handsome
skirt to be long, but as a rule a wom
an insists that her skirt be cut off to
walking length, which just swings
clear from the sidewalk all the way
around. It is youthful, smart and easy
t> manage.
There is aÂ«ne\v length which is called
carriage length. It is for women who
always go in carriages and is little
used by those who walk. This skirt is
made fully two inches too long in the
front and is just the same length all
the way around. It is a sweep length.
The effect Is elegant and somewhat old
fashioned, too. And to be old-fash
ioned is now very stylish. But it is
â  inly for carriage wear, for, if lifted
this skirt takes both hands and be
comes decidedly awkward.
The box plaited cloth skirts hold their
own well and. with very litle change,
are the same as last season, save that
the boxes are larger and are stitched
Hatter around the hips. There are the
little tucked hip, as of yore, and there
are the very full skirts with the shirred
hips. The fitted hips one also sees with
box plaits around the knees.
In every case the skirt flares around
the knees and around the foot and in
the majority of cases it is trimmed
with flounces which are put on rather
plain. The flounces are more like flat
bands made slightly full. There are two
styles of flounces, the full and frilled
and the plain. And both are fashion
able.
To quote from an authority at the
dressmakers' convention:
"Make your skirt of anything, no
matter what. Cut it off so that it clears
the street, but don't make it too short.
Now trim it with rufies to make it look
dressy. You will have a handsome
skirt, no matter what your material
may be, fcjtffeta, foulard, Japanese silk,
voile or canvas."
Handsome Tailor-Made Gowns.
One of the spring innovations is the
French neck. This is very much like
the Dutch neck, but not quite so low.
It is worn with street coats and street
suits. To make the French neck take
any gown you have and remove the
collar. Finish it around the neck with
a cording-. Then throw a white lace
collar around the neck, let it lie flat
and you have the approved French
ni-ck.
If a woniaa has a pretty throat she
can wear the Dutch neck with her
spring cloth suit. Her spring coat will
b-.> made without a collar and will be
finished with a flat collar of lace,
vhich will be fastened in front with
an old-fashioned brooch. A hand
some miniature can be worn if one
happens to have such an article in
the family.
There is a new use for the buttons
of spring and this is in connection with
the new skirts. The skirts are trimmed
with deep flounces. The flounces lap
fan the middle of the front and are fin
ished with two big buttons. This may
be an awkward explanation. But the
flounce comes together or is closed
right in the middle of the front and
thtre is a pointed finish. Two big but
tons covered with cloth or velvet ac
centuate this big point of cloth.
One of the triggest of spring suits
was finished around the neck with a
wide lKce collar, which was buttoned
right in the middle of the front with
a great, big velvet button. Could any
thing have been odder? This great
handsome deep lace collar of elegant
design fastened under the chin with an
immense velvet button. The button
hole, by the way, was worked ruth
lessly through the lace.
"What are the new laces?" asked a
woman shipper of the head of the
lace department. A polite look of sur
prise greeted her. "Madame," s;iid the
head of the department, ""we do not
handie new laces here. The novelty
laces will be found upon the bargain
counters and at the notion department.
Here we keep the old laces and the
laces of standard makes. This year
wo have old laces of China and Rus
sia."
But, all the same, there are pretty
novelty laces which might worthily
find their way into any wardrobe.
These come in the imitations and
are in new forms and patterns. You
cafe do an immense deal with the
handsome laces, which are made of a
combination of two kinds of lace,
heavy and fine, and which look really
elegant in consequence of their make
and pattern. They are novelty imita
tions and come cheap.
The standard laces of the year in
clude the Oriental list, which are intri
cate and beautiful. They are nearly all
hand-worked, in colons and they are
fascinatingly lovely. One can use them
to great advantage in the making of
the cloth gowns of the season. They
form the most beautiful revers, which
are turned back from vests of pale silk.
Nothing dressier could be fancied.
Vests for Spring Wardrobes.
In the spring wardrobe there should
be a vest or two of cloth of gold or sil
ver and a vest of white satin brocade.
These vests can be sleeveless and but
toned down the front with little gold
buttons, ct with big flat velvet buttons.
Either way they make a very impor
tant addition to the wardrobe and one
which no woman can neglect.
A woman who is getting ready for a
Newport season has laid away in her
trunk a dozen beautiful little silk vests
to be worn with the little blazer and
Eton coats. They take the place of the
shirt waist and are smarter. They need
only a stock with them. They are in

Beasley stared, then went white to
the lips.
"Where's Johnny?" he asked
hoarsely.
"At the house," Billy answered. Hi 3

And they are in panne velvet. Oriental
stuff and taffeta. They are made plain
and they are trimmed. Some are deco
rated with a jabot of lace down the
front. Others have buttons and some
are closed with passementerie orna
ments.

says the dressmaker. "And the vest

Very elaborate are the petticoats for
spring wear. Indeed, one hesitates to
approach the subject, because of its
endless difficulties and eccentricities.
They make petticoats of Dresden silk,
combined with pale silk, made in a way
to- secure f\ wonderful frou-frou around
the foot. They make them of brocader
so as to fit closely to the figure, while
around the foot there is a perfect cas
cade of ruffles and flounce.
One very economical dressmaker,
who makes her petticoats all to order,
i^> distinguishing herself by getting up
cheap petticoats in this season of ex
travagance. She makes them of white
lawn. And, around tlvj foot, she sets
a deep ruffle of si!k, which is, in turn,
all closely and thickly ruffled, making
a deep and elegant flounce. "It doesn't
cost much to make such a petticoat,"
she says, "for the silk flounce is but
toned on. It can be taken off and the
skirt laundered. You can get up all
kinds of handsome skirts this way.
chiffon, lace, silk and mousseline de
soie. Make them up as delicately and
daintly as you please. Fasten all to a
deep flounce. Button it on the fine
lawn petticoat and, when the petti
coat is worn or soiled, take off the
flounce."
The wash silk petticoat, made ex
actly to match the silk skirt, is also
worn. And very neat it is. It can be
made of white wash silk, which does
up like a piece of muslin. Perhaps the
showiest petticoat is for swell wear
next summer. It is made of panne
velvet and is to be worn under a skirt
of chiffon.
Four Ilaiulsome Spring Gowns.
Four gowns were made the other lay
to be displayed in a handsome shop '
window. They were all fashioned of
taffeta. And their colors were onion
skin red, which is that indescribable
shade which covers the winter onion;
iron gray, which makes up fascinating
ly with blue; apricot, which is rathar
trying with anything except black or
white, and terra cotta, which was
never lovelier than this season. They
were very neat and showed a variety
of new trimming.
There is a new fancy for trimming
the front of the skirt to look like a
petticoat and for trimming the sides
of the skirt to simulate a draped over
skirt. This is very smart, but un
fortunately it is difficult of execution
and, in the hands of any but a pro
fessional, is a poor fizzle.
Billy expected a storm. He wanted
a storm. The brimstone would relieve
the tension somewhat. But the cloud
didn't break.
When Billy went back to the store,
after feeding the mules, Bea3ley sat
behind his desk drumming on the lid.
â¢Well?" shortly and sharply was all
he asked.
"Bear on the trail," Billy answered
with equal terseness.
Beasley opened a drawe and counted
out Billy's wages. Billy silently pushed
back the gold and silver and went out.
Later when Beasley went home to
supper he found Bessie hugging Johnny
up in her lap and crying over him.
"Did yc-u know about it, pa?" she
aÃkecl tearfully.
Pa didn't know, and Johnny went
over the tale again v with many hugs
find kisses from Bessie strewn along
the path of the recital.
When it was finished Bessie asked,
"Fa, what did you say to Billy?"
The -same may oe said or tne skitz
that i 3 ruffled down the back. This
idea of ruffling the back flounce of the
skirt is a very smart one and is bor
rowed from the styles of some years
ago. But. unfortunately, it is difficult
to execute and the amateur had better
let it alone.
That is the trouble with so many ot
the spring 3tyles. They are intricate aa
to trimming:. And this means that the
woman who wants to dress smartly
must pin her faith to plainer styles and
to simpler modes. She can selec
little pajajna coat 3 and the kimono
eoÂ«tl and the Etons. But she would
d'Â» well to let the very fancy trim
mines rest in the hands of the ikilled
professional.
"I paid 69 cents a yard Tot my taffeta
suit." said a woman the other day.
"But when it came to the trimmings. 1
had to pay h 60." It ia true that the
trimmings cost more than the gown,
and if one counts the buttons as trim
mings, they cost a great deal more.
Buttons are fabulously expensive,
and the prettiest of braidings and pas
sementeries are used along with lace
trimmings and trimmings of silk and
other things. There are bands of silk
made entirely of ivy leaves, which are
worked by hand and applied to the
BDWta, while around the ivy sprays
there is a very delicate tracery of braid.
Gowns and Their Trimmings.
Soutache is employed a great deal
upon the sprir.s gowns, and it is seen in
many different v.ays. Whole patterns
are made of soutache, and there are
suits that ar-Â» covered with it to the
depth o? the knees.
The Greek key designs are marvel
ous !y pretty. Great big scrolls are laid
out in the key pattern and worked
around the foot of the skirt. And there
are smaller scrolls interwoven to make
a glorious trimming.
The amateur can make a study of the
new trimmings and select thoae that
are within her reach. J.here are many
thinars she can do: and if she is wise
shn will pin her faith to those that are
within her possibilities, and not strive
further. Â .
"Do r.ot try to do difficult things is
good advice to- the amateur dressmaker.
Realize that you can make* a better
showing with a nice piece of sooda ele
gantly finished" than with a fancy piece
of goods put together in a bungling
manner.
Th^re are new kinks for the tailor
made gown. But. alas, none of these
are plain kink 3. The tailor-made jW
has "long ago departed from its simpli
city and is now as complicated as it
can be made. It is frilled and ruffled
and trimmed and be-furbelowed until
it is a gorgeous creation. Its only
claim to being called tailor-made lies in
the neatness of its seams, and the very
trim way in which it is finished.
Linings are worthy of note. Mostly
Of white silk they are faced to give a
very gorgeous finish when the coat is
thrown open. As for skirts they are
for th* most part unlined and one seea
few drop skirts. "The drop wears out
so soon." said a ladies' tailor, "that we
prefer to do without the drop skirt and
to use a handsome silk petticoat in
stead. Thor- is nothing in the drop
skirt to specially co-mmend itself."
Dresses have become a study with
dressmakers. Indeed, they have become
an object of research with artists.
They, the m<jdistes, the designers, and
the artist 3 are all working together to
makt the gowns of spring and Easter
as handsome as possible.
Nothing." answered that parent
truthfully, but he neglected to add that
only because the curses tumbled up and
crowded over each other in 3uch wild
confusion that they stuck fast in his
throat like a log- jamb wedged in a cur
rent had he omitted that vent to his
overcharged feelings.
â¢â¢Pa, go this minute and bring him
here to supper. We must thank him
for saving the child's life." Then she
mixed her pronouna. "and I hope you'll
never let him go on the Trail again. I
always said it wasn't safe."
Pa went.
Bessie met them at the gate laughing
and crying all at once as she he.d out
her hand to Billy.
Well, she wore the little ring with
the clasped hands and the joined hearts
to the party that night, and I may tell
it, too, that she promised to wear a
plain gold one at some later date when
Billy should have a train of his own.
And Billy was rightly the hero of the
party that night.IN THE WHALEBOAT

gOLJSS that Brown probably swear
t â¢ this day that it was ali my
fault that our little schooner got
O& J hung up to dry on the reef off
sgir Island. I noticed that
they were ready enough to heave up
when 1 pointed out the difference in
the profits of a few bales of hemp from
Mindanao and the little schooner's belly
full of copra.
As luck would have it. we no sooner
*rot well off the east coast of Luzon
than we caught one of those whirling
Dervish cyclones that spin around on a
pivot and go ahead like blazes at the
same time.
We ran at first, as it semed to be
going our way, but by and by it got so
duevy that Boles decided to heave her
to. We would have made it all right,
but fast as we put our helm down to
round up our jib down-haul jammed in
the block, and before we could get her
off again a. big brute of a comber
whipped the rudder out of her like a
coon cat might snatch the tall out of
a hen. and after that it was all up.
Fourteen hours later the poor little
packet was lying with a broken back
across the reef off Mongir Island, and
we were sitting on the hot sand above
high-water mark, breathing in the
stink of the seaweed, and cursing at
our luck until the kick of our curses
knocked us flat on our backs, and we
went to sleep. We needed sleep, too, I
tell you, because for twenty-four hours
w had been working the pump handle
like the President at a White House re
ception.
The island turned out to be a regu
lar stamping ground for castaways. In
the early part of the same gale that
drove us there a little bark had
bounced up on the reef, and there had
crawled out of her the scurviest outfit
of sea scamps I ever clapped 'eyes on.
We fell foul of each other and I
undertook to straighten out the mess.
My plan was really simple enough and
would have worked out all right if I'd
only used a little common sense. Of
course, it was plain when they came
down the beach that night that they
were looking for trouble, and after I
had fired them out of our camp I was
mightily unsatisfied with the layout;
COt only because it was plain that they
wanted to get square with us for hav
ing put two of their shipmates out of
commission, but also because I saw
the Portugee's snaky eyes coil around
the corners c-f our money box. I
wouldn't have cared even then if it
hadn't been for the girl, but I hated
to think of what might happen to her
if that bunch of Pea scavengers ever
BPCt the under hold of us.
Boles and I had quite an argument
about it and I must say that I was
iÂ«:al rut out at his pigheadednes;,-; but
I suppose that that was where his
British blood stuck out. When I found
that nothing short of a Morton pur
chase would ever start him, 1 did what
seemed to me to be the only thing. I
fast took my gun and went down the
beach and held up those seagoing
hoboes ltd made them mend their
beat. I got the drop on four of them,
but the worst of the lot, the Portugee,
managed to slip away. I'm not sure
whether I hit him or not.
That night Brown stood guard over
my shanghaied crew of criminals,
wreckers. Llackbirders, or>/ whatever
else they v.ere, while I got in a good
ten hours' sleep. The next day I piled
them into .the boat, jumped aboard
ir.y?elf and we hit the brine, laying
n. course for the next inhabited island.
which was only about a hundred miles
away. it was my idea to get hold of
some i-ort of a packet when we got
there and go back after the others,
and I took money enough with me to
do it.
"Now then," said I. when we had got

had stepped the masts and shaken the
t.ails out of the clew-lines, "this old

one â the dago I called him â grave an
assenting whine. The others turned
their backs and lit their pipes.
It wasn't a cheerful yachting party,
but as we left the long green sea miles
under our stern, I felt my spirits ris
ing like the glass after the gale is over.
Toward 2 in the morning I began to
think that the island could not be far
away, fur it seemed to me that we must
have rapped off at least eighty knots
in our day's sail, and since dark, when
the breeze dropped, we had been pulling
at a three-knot clip. So I told them to
take it easy and daylight would see us
off the island.
Then I spelled them for a while, let
ting two pull while the other two
caught a nap. And then at length the
east began to plow, and one by one the
stars grew pale. I strained my eyes
ahead, and I'll never forget the sinking
feeling of those few minutes, when sud
denly with a flash of crimson the sun
â hot up into a cloudless sky and showed
. nn land in sight.
For a moment I was staggered, for
the island was a high one and should
have been seen thirty miles away. Then
I thought Of the cursed currents that

of our course. The men seemed as
eager as I was, and the bow man was
standing on his thwart studying the
6ky line ahead. But nothing came of
It, and he turned and looked at me ex
pectantly, as did the others.
Then the trap was sprung. The
stroke oar suddenly rose to his feet and
pointed over, the starboard quarter.
"Land-Q!" he growled.
T ." : "ir nrourd in the stern, with a
quick tug at my heart. The next mo
ment a great bulk crashed down on me,
and two great paws like a gorilla's fas
tened on my throat. Something flashed
in the air â the sun rushed to the zenith
at one leapâ and then the light went
out.
I wasn't adrift very long. The next
thing that reminded me of my troubles
was the nasty feeling of my arms and
legs being asleep. I woke to find my
self flat on my face In the bottom of
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALX.
the boat and my arms lashed to a for
ward and my feet to an after thwart,
so that my back was bent like a swung
hammock. Some one -sitting right over
my amidships section was giving a lec
ture, and once in a while would drive
his words home by landing the toe of
his boot against my ribs.
"Vy tr-r-row him oudt?" said a voice
that I recognized as belonging to the
Scandinavian misfit. "I dhink ye mide
make 'lna r-r-row."
"I soy, as we knocks 'im in 'is

"Dutchy right-a. Make-a de Yankee
pig-hog pull-a de boat. Suppose he
no pull-a?â knock-a de face back!"
For a fgw moments there was an ar
gument tfmt was a whole course in
deep-sea dialect, but as the majority
were in favor of sending me to do a
trick at the oars, while they sat around
and encouraged me by a few ingenious
devices of their own, my serious-mind
ed flriend was overruled, and finally,
with an oath, he whipped out his knife
and made a slash at the lanyard
around my ankles. Incidentally, the
knife bit quite a way into my leg, but
I seemed to be the only one that
noticed it.
The Scandinavian cut the lashing
that bound my hands to the thwart.
This freed me, but what with the
numbness of my limbs and the thump
that I got on the head, I was, for the
time being, paralyzed.
"Come ou,dt!" says he; "vat's de
madder ohf you? You dond vish to
vor-r--rk. you " He got a good fist
ful of my hair and began to drag me
out from under the thwarts. The dago
was doing the mahout act along my
back with the point of his knife. I've
got some of the scars yet.
They had got me sitting on the sec
ond thwart, and the dago shoved one
of the big, heavy sweeps into each
hand. The Scandinavian had thrown
another lashing around my ankles and
made it fast through one of the lim
bers, and not satisfied with that he
passed another around my waist. The
dago was trying to get up a forced
draught by jabbing me in the ribs with
the hilt of his knife.
At first I was as stiff as a two-year
old after the day of his first ran, and
I came in for more mauling than I've
had to take in all the rest of my life
put together, but the pulling was the
best thing I could have done to get my
hinges in working order, and pretty
soon I could feel the strength coming
back and the blooa beginning to clr
aHiate again.
The Island lay right abeam of us
"when I was bowled over, but was hid
den In a light haze on the horizon. As
I twisted my head around to look at
it I could see that it was a long pull
to get there, but that didn't bother me
any â my only worry was about getting
there at all. The crew being pretty
well used up from pulling all night
long, had dropped off to sleep one by
one, but the hairy bruiser in the stern
sheets lolled back against the tiller,
and once in a while would give me a
grin that put me in mind of a colt with
his ears back, it was so full of cuss
edness. There was still a great blue
swelling over his eye where I had plant
ed my fist two days before, and once
in a while he would rub it gently and
look first at me, then over the side.
Whether it was to trick me into
bringing things to a head or not, I am
sure I don't know, but pretty soon he
pretended to be asleep. I was watch
ing him out of the tall of my eye, pull
ing away evenly all the while, and at
the same time overhauling my brain
as a machinist goes over his running
gear with a hammer, looking for a
flaw. The difference was that I found
some flaw at every rap. Then sud
denly, Just as I was about to give it up
in disgust, and was making up my
mind to try to take what was com
ing the way a captured Malay pirate
takes the Chinese New Year, my heart
gave a leap into my throat that almost
strangled me. Dead astern and hull
down over the horizon I sighted a sail.
Of course, I managed to not let on
that I'd sighted anything and pretty
soon the devil in the stern dozed off
again, and this time I think that he
was really asleep for a few minutes,
for he woke up suddenly with a quick
start, and the way his hand flew out
to the rifle at his side, as well as the
startled look that he threw my way,
gave him dead away. I pretended not
to notice it, but swung away at the
sweeps and directly his eyes closed
again. But somehow I suspicioned
that this nap was all a fake. Now and
then I looked past him as indifferent
ly as I could and saw that the vessel
'way astern was bringing a fresh
breeze. Pretty soon the dark blue
patch showed distinctly on the thin
edge of the hprizon.
After that first pang of hopefulness
my heart sank again bit by bit. Just
as the lead line crawls slowly over the
side where the water is very deep. I
knew that the breeze was bound to
roach us while the vessel was stiU a
long way off. even supposing that her
course would have brought her close
aboard us, and at the first puff my
hnnd would be played out. Besides
this there was the chance of one of
them waking up and casting a weather
eye along the skyline; but still they
slept and soon I was able to raise the
hull of the vessel, which appeared to
be an island schooner â but the blue,
dimpling water had filled half the
distance between us.
The watchdog in the stern was evi
dently asleep again, for an uncomfort
able sounding gurgle was coming from
his. hairy throat with every slow
breath â evidently the genuine article
this time â and suddenly, from the
sheer knowledge that for the mo
ment no one's eye was on me, a
thought shot across my brain like the
flush of a meteor through the black
night.
Behind me, right within the reach
of my arm, the Scandinavian was
calked off, and I could see the hilt of
his knife sticking out under the skirt
of his dirty cotton jumper. It didn't
seem possible that I could slip It out,
cut my lashings and clamber aft over
all that crowd in time to reach the big
fellow before he woke; still if I failed
there was still a chance to put up a
bit of a fight, and although it would
b^ an uphill game it was a sight bet
ter than being butchered in cold blood.
If I did miscue. at any rate, I could
peg out with my dander up.
Softly dropping th>i oars, I half
turned on the thwart and, reaching be
hind me, fumbled gently at the waist
of the sleeping man. My ringers found
the hilt of the knife by instinct, and
with an easy tug it slipped from the
sneath, and quick as a flash I t..
back, shoved it und^r my thigh ana
swung forward on the sweeps again,
but my touch had roused him, and with
a sleepy grunt he dug his knuckles into
his. eyes and yawned with a creak like a
rusty gate. The others stirred a bit
and the helmsman woke with another
start.
Then my heart stood still, for the
Scandinavian suddenly straightened
himself, shaded his eyes with his hand,
and took a long look astern. The man
in the stern, curious from the intent
ness of his gaze, twisted around and
looked over his shoulder.
My time had come. With a yell I
sprang suddenly to my feet, and.
swinging with all my strength, landed
my flst on the side of the Scandina
vian's Jaw, knocking him clean across
the gunnel. The sudden list of the boat
threw the others to the same side, and
before they could right themselves I
leaped square on to the gunnel and
clung there, while the green water
came pouring into the boat. The ntxt
moment we were all struggling In the
sea.
Of course I was the only on* expect
ing it. and, besides, the others were
sort of loggy and thick with sleep.
Quick as a cat, when I found myself
in the water, I gripped the Â»tern of the
boat and swung myself up across her.
Once astride the keel. I reached down,
grabbed up one of the long oars, and,
swinging it slantwise, brought it down
on the ugly head of the thug that tried
to shoot me, who was struggling along
side. He gasped once, then sank, and I
sat and watched the bubbles coming up
and waited for him to rise again and
give me a chance for another crack,
All at once, most likely from the sud
den reaction that came of knowing that
the trumps were in my hands, all of the
fight oozsd out of me. It would have
dead easy for me to have finished off
the others one by one, and they knew
it. and there was something sort of
pitiful in the scared faces that they
turned up at me. A little way oft from
the boat the old squarehead was swim
ming for all he was worth, his shoul
ders humped up like a box turtle. He
was a poor swimmer, and his strokes
were getting shorter and quicker and
his breath came like a grampus when
he breaks.
"Grab the side if you want," I yelled;
"I'll not harm ye; but as you love your
life don't try to climb up!"
I doubted that he'd tver reach the
boat, but he made it and clung there,
eyiug me like a bear in a trap. Then
we waited in silence.
Soon the edge of the breeze struck
me, and behind it came the schooner,
tripping along like a girl going to mar
ket. Straight down thsy came, and
soon I knew that we were sighted from
her deck 3, for she shifted her course a
bit and bore down directly at us.
"When close aboard she luffed into the
wind, and in a minute over went a
surfboat and came bouncing along the
rising sea. Then, as she drew near, I
knew that I was safe, for in the stern
sat O'Connell. whom I had met in Ma
nila not long before we started for the
Islands.
An hour later, in the cabin of the
schooner, I told the whole story over
a stiff glass of grog. Although Captain
McCree was a good sort enough. I
could not persuade him to go back for
Boles and the others, as the weather
had changed, the glass was falling and
it was at the breaking up of the mon
soon. So I did not press it, knowing
that my mates were well found in grub,
and that I could soon get them taken
off.
The schooner was bound for Pulo
Anna, and when we reached there I
left her and not Ion? after sailed by
another vessel for Tap. On the way wÂ«
touched at the island, but the others
had gone.â ?-r CBUHI of tighteen months in

V. I Wachusett in the South Pa-

starboard glim and for a period of five
months I did all my looking with the

But Uncle Sam was good to his old

set about rambling some more.
The mishap that came near wreck
ing a mild blue eye happened in the
middle of the Pacific Ocean. One day
a young ensign named Clark got busy
with a runs crew of lobsters and
tried to pass us out some Oral In

pretty gt>od. but it Is bad for the eyes.
Tc illustrate the lecture on ordnance
the ensign removed the fusestock from
a six-inch shell. This fuse was a metal
cylinder three in' hes long, containing
a loaded plunger fitted with a percus

out of the cylinder to tell us how it
worked and dropped the plunger. As it
fell I stooped forward to pick it up;
the cap struck a metal plate in the
deck and exploded and my faithful
eye stopped the discharge in its up

CHIMMIE FADDEN: A HEART-TO-HEART TALK
ON THE USE AND VALUE
OF HOT AIR
ME good old modder is up against
de hardest trouble of her life â
she's making more money dan
she needs for her living ex-
penses, and she don't know
what to do about it. I was telling you
how ehe got to be a French laundress
along with de swell trade dat Miss
Fannie and Duchess drummed up for
her. Duchess made her do business
M> face was polka-dotted with minute
chunks of scrap iron and several
lumps of burning powder lodged in
the eyeball. The ship's surgeon dug
out the powder and bound my eyes in
a flour sack that had three large
purple X's on it. We had the best of
flour sacks. He said the wounds were
nothing and that I would be all right
in a few days. And so I would, had
they not sent me to stand lookout on
the fore topsail yard in a wet gale.
Cold settled in the injured eye and
my prospect of becoming an admiral
grew quite dull and blinky.
For months I lurked cm the gloomy
lower deck away from the light, at
tired in a pair of goggles and a thick
mantle of melancholy. I thought a
great deal about my past, but didn't
care to brood on ihe future.
Our ship was at sea when my lamp
went out, and we were forty-five days
reaching the coast of Chile. After
much coastwise cruising, following the
habit of warships afraid to go to sea,
the tubby Wachusett fell in with the
Pacific squadron at Valparaiso, and the
assembled surgeons held a board of
survey on my smoky headlight. Not
withstanding the eye was a fierce-look
ing proposition, the chief surgeon the
moment he beheld it exclaimed to the
board:
"Do you know, gentlemen. I once had
a valuable dog with an eye like that.
He get it poisoned in the woods."
The surgeon then grew intensely en
thusiastic â over the dogâ and went
into details for the benefit of the doc
tors, who also seemed interested. I
did hear the dog's name, but have for
gotten it. Any way, they packed me
off on a British mail steamer, deck
passage, via the Isthmus of Panama,
to the navy yard at Brooklyn. There I
lingered three months in the Marine
Hospital, better known as the Stone

tnere are nev er any takers. Experi
e nce has always been a drug on the
market and always will be. However,
this fact will not deter us from relat
ing the life story of John D. Scroggins.
John D. began life in his early youth,
as did most of us. At least, history
has no record of anyone beginning
after the age of forty. He was ambi
tlous and enterprising and was ush
ered into the world with the full grown

price. Mrs. Murphy is her partner, and
dey has a dozen goils wolking for dem,
and all de trade dey can do. When
she foist got into trouble wit making
more moneji dan her expenses she sends
for me and Duchess and she says, "Me
dears," she says, "what will I ever
do? Shall I lower me price or refuse
all ie business dat is coming our way
since me and Mrs. Murphy got to be
French laundresees, instead of Irish-
American wash ladies. What will I do,
me dears?â for all de stockings we isn't
wetring is filling with money and It is
a sore trouble."
Well, you should seen de look on
Duchess' face when modder talked of
lowering prices so she wouldn't have
bo much money coming in.
"liaise your prices, modder dear,"
she says. "Never lower 'em."
"aure, dearie," says me troubled
moÂ«ldfcr. "we tried dat, and de more
we raises 'em de more woik de swell
ladies sends to us, and de more goils
we has to hire. It's a bad way."
Duchess was so paralyzed at de way
de old ladies looks at de game dat Bhe
wouldn't speak, so I says: "Why don't
you and Mrs. Murphy start a saving
banik account, and not be boddered
wit de keep of de long Teen, if dats
i\h..t's keeping you awake nights. I
don't know what de feeling can be
like to have more long green dan I
waitâhavingi tâ having a French goil for a
wifri â but if it is bad as all dat, put
you â  troubles on de savings banks."
"Js'ot in dis end of town, Chimmie,"
Mrs. Murphy, "it's wort your
life to draw out your money when
you once get it. If you are seen go
ing to de bank and draw out so much
as de price of a new apron, a run
starts. Dey are good citizens in dis
part of Manhattan, all right â per
haps â but dey can't be educated to
believe dat any one wants to draw
out money unless de bank is on do

At length, one day, the main squeeze

Tex., and eventually wound up on a
cattle train, which was getting pretty
close to the calf. An old-time winter
was raging in Brooklyn, and I couldn't
stand the cold after the long sojourn in
tropic lands and islands. From Galves
ton I went to San Antonio on the tin
roof of a day coach in the night time,
and struck a bully job climbing poles
for the Bell Telephone Company, which
was installing a system. At this con
determination to be rich, famous, and
unindicted at the same time. It will
be seen from this how far reaching
were his designs. Almost any of us
might determine to be any one, or
even any two, of these, but to make
up your mind in cold blood and with
malice aforethought to be all three, is
a rather larger contract than most of
us care to undertake.

their substance in paying their

dey has it for jure I don't know at all,
for dey never uses it. But let 'em tink
dat de bank is paying out a cent to
anybody, den dey all begins to talk
in pagan langwudges to once, to pull
out delr hairs, poor souls, and de
coppers wit deir night sticks isn't
enough to drive 'em away from de
banks. What good is money dat you
don't need for rent and tea? If you
keep it in a stocking like your dear
modder and me does, you is afraid of
de robbers; and If you put it in a
bank you can't go near it wltout start
ing a riot. It's to de bad, Chimmle."

me modder says. "Dere's a Roosian

husband runs ten sewing machines In
deir bedroom â where he also sleeps,
and where you couldn't swing a ful

uniform that lured me into the navy,

Well, I sees dat what de old ladies
was wanting was for Duchess to take

her a little, and she has it now in a

while the unhappy steers went on alone
to Jdr. Armour, I switched off and
worked the Alton road as far as Peoria,
111., looking for foundry jobs.
The advent of summer had closed
most of the shops, so I cut across on
the Wabash to Keokuk, la., intending
to take the river to the gulf and go to
sea some more. On this box-car dash
through Western Illinois I passed wtth
in twenty miles of Mudville, which
town had no bulletins from me in three
years; but I did not stop off, having
neglected to make my fortune while
absent.
There is at Keokuk a Government
canal, under river and harbor auspices.
The man in charge of the canal had a
relative high in naval circles, and my
talk, togrs and papers made a hit with
him. Wherefore, I slid gracefully into
a berth as lineman on a Government
steamboat at $40 per month and board.
My success instilled vast quantities
of bitterness in the bosoms of certain
youthful Keokukians who were edu
place. He was a member of the best
clubs and he could write for the most
select magazines in the country; so
could the rest of us, but that's all the
good it would do us. John D. could
get his stuff printed, especially when
his concern kindly condescended to
take half a dozen pages of pure adver
tising matter every month while the
John D. series ran.
All in all it is fair to assume that
John D. was successful; even he would
probably have admitted that If you had
put it to him squarely. To be sure,
all that he had was his board and
clothes in various forms, but It was
rather richer board and finer clothes
make it, dough she often gives 'em a
crooked steer when dey says dey wants
to know. What dey make from de rule
Duchess tells 'em is very on de blink,
and dey comes back for more of de real
stuff dat she makes. Well, de odder
day Miss Fannie haa a crowd of ladies
in for to drink tea and talk opray, and
some of 'em says, "Can't your maid
make us some of her candy?"
I wonders what was up when I takes
woid to Duchess and finds she has a
lot of de stuff all made up.
She knows most of 'em like dey was
side partners of hers, she being wit
Miss Fannie so long, and she pays to
'em dat if ever dey wanted some of her
candy dey could, get it at de shops. Dey
was all so tickled to deat you'd tought
dat dey had found a gold briek â and
maybe dey had!
Let me tell you, when I gets a chance
I asks Duchess what fell, and she says
she was going to make a fortune for
our kiddle, Emmett. What do you tink
dat goil had done?
She'd gone to a swell candy shop and
done business wit de boss. He'd heard
about de dinky stuff Miss Fannies
maid give to Miss Fannies frens, and
he says to Duchess dat he'd give her a
rake-off on all he sold if she'd show
'em how to make it. Well, p'chee, dat
goll had a patent on de name â It's a
dinky French name I couldn't pro
nounce in a tousand years â and a pat
ent on how to make it, and she drives
a bargain wit de candy boss, and now
she's drumming up trade.
Say, you should see her get busy! All
of Miss Fannies frens, and all of little
Fannies frens. Is staked out for to bull

and if a shot) doesn't keep itâ to dc
woods wid dat shop! She's buying real
estate in de Bronx now, and by de time
Emmett grows up he'll have a glass
arm from cutting off coupons.
What has dis to do wit hot air? Well,
well! Dat candy is made of corn-
Starch, maple sugar and hot air. Dats
cated for the canal, so to speak, by
swimming, fishing and falling into it
since birth. But. alas! those hopeless
aspirants had no man-of-war uniforms.
Neither was there a boy among them
who had an eye almost blown out in
thi> service of his country, and could
talk with the boss about squadrons and
things. It was me for the soft snap, all
right, and I could have been the sassi
est brat on the river. Maybe I was.
Just the same I bulged to the front
and got promoted to pilot on a little
tow boat so small there was just room
for myself, the boiler and Mr. T. Foley,
engineer, in the 6rder named. Some
times, when cramped for space, I used
to get out on the bank to turn myself
around and Mr. T. Foley was wont to
do the same. I might have commanded
a bigger boat but for the enmity of
the chief pilot of the canal fleet. One
Sunday the old man spun a yarn about
an immense tooth of some kind he
found Â»n the river. I foolishly asked
him if the tooth came out of the mouth
of the river. Two or three mutÂ» laugh
ed and the chief pilot thought I was
guying him. He never got over it. In
reviewing the past it occurs to me I
might have been too fresh for fresh
water sailingâ and in a canal, at that.
However, promotion is not always
what it seems. As already stated, the
boat I commanded was fully loaded
with myself, the boiler and Mr. T.
Foley, seated in the order named, and
we had no room to carry a cook. This
slight kink in the promotion business
compelled me to board ashore, at the
same wages, and my finances didn't do
so well. Still, we did valiant service for
the United States and Keokuk. towinj?
small barges of stone in the dead
waters of the canal.
The name of this boat was "The
Messenger," and I deemed the handling
of her my masterpiece in the art of per
ilous navigation. The Messenger was
about as speedy as the boys who wear
a blue uniform bearing that label. One
day we ventured into the mighty cur
rent of the Mississippi. I headed the
Messenger upstream and steamed full
speed for three hours in the shade of
one tree on the bank; then I whistled
for help and a real tug came out and
got us.
But what could you expect of a boat
blighted with that name?
Late in the summer the fleet moved
down to Quincy, 111., and built a wing
dam from the Missouri shore. They
reduced me from pilot on the Messen
ger to deck hand on a larger boat that
rated a cook. The pay was still the
same, but my income was nearly

night. It seemed to him that he stood
alone on a mountain top, or it might
have been in the front pew at a mis

alone. On every side the ground fell
away to an illimitable der>th, and the

dreamed that he reviewed the long
climb that he had had to reach the top
and the many obstacles that he had
overcome. The bad part of the dream
was that he couldn't for the life of

neer put on his heart-breaking clothea.
He wore â  whits vest, plug hat and
gloves, and. with a fragrant bud in thj
lapel of his Prince Albert, he set out
to visit the. fair Quincy -dame. The
steamboat lay with her bow moored to
the bank, the stern being swung out
a little from the shore, after the man
ner of river. craft. There was a stage,
plank forward, but none aft. Some
painters at "work on the after part of
the- upper deck had left the end of a
plank projecting from the roof, and the
pale, tickle moon threw a heavy,
elongated shadow of this plank from
the 10-wer guardrail to the shore. The
dark streak looked just like a staging.
"Well, the elderly engineer came out
of his room. the flame of love flicker
ing brightly beneath the white vest,
and started to walk ashore on the
shadow. It broke before he had gone
two steps. We get a flash of his splash
and a glimpse of his bald head ere the
laughing waters closed over it. "Man
overboard!" shouted the second engi
neer, and two or three small boats put
off to the rescue.
The bald scalp bobbing along in tha
swift current served as. Â» beacon, and
semetlmes a broad surface of whits
vest rolled into view as the fat engi
neer lunged and kicked in frantic en
deavor to reach shore. Laura:" he
yelled at Intervals. "Oh. Laura, save
me!" That may have been the name
of the lady. We overhauled him 300
yards below the steamboat. The plus
hat was never again seen by mortal
eye â probably it filled and sank, never
to win another trusting heart.
Owing t" the state uf his wind and
wardrobe, the tat Â«_nsineer sent regrets
that niarht tv the lady of his choice.
When she h<*arii h >w he fell overboard
that fickle dam.' also sent back regrets
and the ring, ami thus another rosy
dream blew up. Verily, he that Is in
love walks upon a shadow.

That's all there was to the drtam.
but the next morning he began to
think it over and before his think was
finished he had come to the conclu
sion that it was no dream. He had
been climbing a lons hill all his life
and now that he had rpached the top
he sat around wondering why he had
been such a fool as to do it. The view
wasn't much to se* and it was mighty
cold and lonely up there. He didn t
have any neighbors, or if he did, they
were on too of other mountain peaks
so far away that he couldn't reach
them without a telephone. In other
words he had suc
ceeded In every
thing that he had
undertaken only to
be convinced that
it wasn't worth
while. Other mÂ«n
who hadn't sat up
their ambitions
seemed to get a
better time out of
life and have less
fear of falling off if
they walked in
their sleep.
Our conclusion Is
the same as John
D.'s; success isn't
worth having after
you get it. It's the
man who never suc
ceeds but who is al
ways going to â day
after to-morrow â
who skims the real
cream of life. At
any rate he never
needs to wake up.
So we say, the man
who succeeds, fails
in the end. while

succeeds â in for

OF OLD
LIM JUCKLIN
ON WEALTH
** T the schoolhouse there had! been
a lecture in sweeping denuncia
|l tion of all wealth. Shaking his
' black mane and seeming to pop
his forefinger, the lecturer, in a sort of
frenzy, had declared the dollar to be
the enemy of the human race. There
was no hotel in the neighborhood, so
the lecturer went home with old Lim
uel Jucklin. Several of the neighbors
dropped in. Having been dazzled by
thf speaker they wondered if Limuel
were to be "Hashed into silence." The
speaker, Professor Conners, had been
pleased with his audience. He had
not been able to distinguish the differ
ence between acquiescence and dumb
astonishment. Beside the Jucklin fire
side he would continue the conquest.
He regarded himself as a factor in the
ccming revolution, and he knew that
all great revolutions begin at the â¢
hearthstone.
"I always like to hear a man talk
when he appears to believe what he
has to say," remarked old Lim. "The
fact that the fiddler is in earnest adds
a good deal to the quality of the fid
dlin'. But a man may be sincere and
at the same time fiddle out a tune that
there ain't much music in. So, Pro
fessor, you say that the dollar is the
curse of the human race?"
"Well, yes, I may so concentrate the
trouble of the world into the dollar."
"Ah, hah. But don't you think that
the dollar represents the concentra
tion of man's incentive to work? The
greatest curse that could fall upon
man would be idleness. In all ages,
so far as I have been able to gather,
work has been the salvation of man.
Enjoyments and all sorts of sports and
pleasures wear out, but labor en
dures.'
"You forget," said the professor,
"that labor was first put upon man as
a penalty, as a curse for disobedience."
"No, I don't forget that. I don't
forget that it may appear that way.
But Adam wasn't thoroughly satisfied
with idleness. If he had been he
tr^ACE improvement is a topic
f) which so far has naught save

V istence; bandied about from one
theory to 'another, interpreted
now by one faction, then denied by a
second, until the conclusion is forced
that there is no abiding faith, much
less a dogma. Not to concede that
there are laws controlling sociology
vould be simply to relegate it to the
condition of a mere output of chaos.
To ascribe to chance all the many
evolutions which nature has employed
in her productive processes would be
scarcely less reasonable. When the
systematic study of these factors of
guidance and their consequent reac
tion upon man as an individual, and
collectively as a species, are reduced
to the accuracy of an applied science,
then and not until then will sociology
become an organic entity â and not as
it now is, a mere spluttering of pre
judices and random guesswork.
The essential and fundamental prob
lem in this connection is heredity, and
how much and by what it can be in
would have let good enough alone. lie
wouldn't have eaten the forbidden
fruit when Eve offered it to him. He
d-dn't have anything to occupy his
mind and he yielded. But leavin* the
things that we can never know much
about and comin' down to man of to
day, we see the virtue of work and the
evil of idleness. Money is the essence
of industry. Without it all life would
b'; confusion."
"But the love of it has been aptly
termed the root of all evil," said the
professor.
The neighbors looked at Jucklin, and
old man Brizentine silently pressed a
dollar which he had received that day
for the hire of a horse and breathed
hard. '"Yes," admitted Lim, "that's
so. But the love of money ain't money
itself â ain't the use of it. We com
mend a man for savin 1 his dollars, but
if every man were to save to the very
closest life would hardly be worth
livin'. That's where an abundance of
meney comes in as a virtue, whereas
a little money might be an evil. When
we have a great deal we are inclined
to sitend and this makes others pros
perous. Out of wealth grows leisure
and out of leisure there grows and
biooms a very precious plant. It's
name is knowledge. Money is the
mother of science and therefore of
health. It ain't true that poverty is
always blessed with good digestion.
Poverty is not cleanliness and there
fore is not next to godliness. Poverty
is a crime, not restin' on the indi
vidual, perhaps, but havin' its cause
somewhere among the errors of those
who went before. I see, professor,
that you are rather apt in citin' the
Bible. If it hadn't been foV money the

fluenced in all its various dependen
cies. Heredity ought to be a subject
of the curriculum in the medical
course of every college and university.
Its normal as well as its diseased con
dition â that is, its physiology as well
as its pathologyâ must become as fa
miliar as those of the heart or lungs.
4 The investigator will be called upon
to differentiate the inborn from the
acquired characteristics; those given
by nature from those produced by
pest-natal influences. Even this very
elementary classification offers an un
limiteft field for study, and at the
same time probably contains the es
sential factors for a true scientific
foundation. To illustrate the value of
this subdivision we may draw upon
several of the accepted popular
truths. It is generally agreed that
"inborn traits" are directly transmit
ted, are in fact and substance heredi
tary, while those acquired are not.
Are we not all interested in the ques
tion, Does feeble health in a parent
transmit feeble health in its offspring,
i. c., does the parent of necessity give
like inborn qualities to the child? This
inference seems so logical that it hfs
become almost an axiom, if not an ac

book would be locked up in a few
places. As it is, money has given it
to the poor. And, gettin' down a lit
tle closer to the Bible, it appears to
me that about all of the Lord's most
favored servants were rich. On. one
man ne smiled and his cattle in
creased."
"Very true," admitted the professor,
"but don't you believe that in America
the present struggle for money is about
to ruin the country?"
"When men race at full speed for
money they drop out some that is al
ready in their pockets and r~ose who

grievous errors committed, both by
professional and laity. This is just
one of those points where there is no
scientific proof and consequently no
established scientific inference. We are
not yet in possession of the laws which
govern the reaction of acquired traits
upon inborn traits and vice versa.
We have but recently seen human
ity emancipated from one of these
'"truths" by the revelation of fact in
the matter of tuberculosis. It Avas not
the popular belief, with all the fatality
of a superstition, that a tubercular pa
rent ipse facto bequeathid tuberculo
sis to its offspring, but the fate was ac
cepted with all the callousness of
resignation. As a result, no effort on
the part of the community nor on the
part of the victim was put forth to
counteract the "law of nature."
With the scientific light thrown upon
the popular belief, by the admission
of a germ as the factor of causation,
the entire situation became changed.
It was discovered that it was the in
pick it up profit by it. And, when the
end of the mad race is about reached,
the racer halts, draws a long breath
and then decides to build a college or
to found a library. He wants to leave
a foot-print. He wants to be remem
bered by the racers who are to come
after him."
"Ah," sighed the professor, "but how
about those who are run overâ whose
lives are crushed out? How about the
millions that are ground down? How
about the man who is not willing that
labor should have its due?"
"He is an evil until heMs dead, and
then. He may become a blessing," old
Lim replied. "Poverty stricken men
personal matter, and that the acquired
resistance of the subject, not the her
editary transmission of the parent,
was the line of defense in preventing
or overcoming the disease. The entire
position became changed, and instead
of hopeless indifference, intelligent ac
tivity stimulated both community and
individual into saving grace. Preven
tion is now the watchword, not hered
ity. Such is the result of a scien
tific acquaintance with one single fact
in sociology. The entire pathology of
tubercular inheritance has been
dumfounded. If the clearing away
of delusion in this one sociological
factor has done so much, is it not self
evident how startling would be the
revolution, if the entire subject was
founded' upon a scientific basis? We
must, however, recognize that the
problem is a complex one.
Following up our illustration the
student on heredity would naturally
ask the question â has this individual
simply benefited himself â or has he in
fact alteredâ 'hereditary influences â
has he added anything beneficial to
have committed murder. But murder
is not the principle of the poor. Riches
have oppressed, have been heartless,
but that is not the spirit of money,
Money is every man's servant. If he
permits it to become his master, he
suffers for it. Money discovered Amer-
ica, and you must admit that this coun-
try has been a blessing to the human
race. Columbus was looking for a road
over which he could transport wealth,
Men seeking for fortunes have made
about all the discoveries on the face of
the earth. The rudder of the ship is
the universal tongue of the gospel,
Science may sail and discover and
come back and report; but commerce
halts and builds up the country."
Then the professor thought to sound
a deadener with the following: "But
do you think it right to marry for
money?"
"Well," drawled the old man, wink-
ing slyly at one of his neighbors, "not
unless you love the woman that has
money. Most of men love women on
account of beauty or some other at-
traction, and money has the faculty of
makin' both men and women powerful
handsome. I recollect an old maid
that used to live not far from here,
She was so ugly that horses would get
scared at her. And her homeliness
wasn't goodness, either. She had a
disposition like a porcupine. No mat-
ter from what direction you might
approach her there was a quill. Folks
didn't like to pass her house, for she'd
come out on the veranda and shout
vitriol at them. The hip bones of pov-
erty stuck up through her farm. She
just about made a livin'. But one day
her old uncle died, report said, and
left her a hundred thousand dollars,
Then the folks began to travel by her
the species? The scientific answer to
that question is the solution of the en
tire problem of "heredity transmis
sion." We cannot now give the an
swer; but it may be suggested by an
attempted analysis of the methods em
ployed by nature to render immune
any large section of the race against
factors which are destructive to the
individual, but perchance constructive
to the species. The viticulturist in his
evolution of a "resistant stock" sac
rifices many individuals, but his meas
ures gradually develop a "species"
which is resistant. The individuals
are no longer sacrifices because the
conditions for acquired necessities,
that is, outside influences, are unable
to vitiate the inborn or transmitten
conditions. All this is but a limited
reference to one phase of the subject,
and necessarily leave untouched the
great factor of procreation.
A subject so unheeded in its im
portance, but so powerful in its pos
sibilities, that it almost annuls the
popularity of the belief that man is
now the noblest. If he is as good as
he is by accident, what would be his
standard if he was a scientific output?
The lower animals are largely a pro
duction of intelligence if not of sci
hcuse. Some of them stopped tor pay
their respects. Among them was
'Squire Goodall. He pretended that
he hadn't heard of her good fortune.
He asked her how her uncle was get
tin' along and remarked that if she
needed a side of bacon or two he
would willingly fetch it over to her.
She beamed on him and he dodged,
but stood it. He told her he'd like to
make her a present of his horse and
she thanked him and took *t, and he
walked home. He dreamed about her
that night and it was a nightmare, but
he decided that he was in love with
her. Two days later he went back
and made her a present of a cow.
she smacked her mouth and took the
cow, and 'lowed he was the sweetest
man. He thought so, too, but didn't
say so. Well, shortly afterward he
proposed to her and she accepted him.
They were married and the neighbors
came in to drink cider and eat ginger
cake. Just after the ceremony up
comes a feller and says to her: 'Miz
Gcodall, I was over in the Sycamore
country the other day and met your
old uncle and he told me to tell you
that he was mighty in need of help
and that he wished you would send
him a dollar or so if you could spare
it'
"What uncle is that?' the new hus
band inquired, and the wife answered:
"Why, the one that was reported dead
some time ago. Poor man, I think,
lovey, we'd better send him a cow.'
Goodall sneezed out some ginger cake
and was never known to smile after
that. So, you see, professor, even the
love of money did good in that ln
stance. It got a husband for a de
servin' woman."

ence. the "higher" a coincident. The
reproduction of the species along lines
of arrangement surely is desirable;
its possibilities a problem which will
yet be esteemed worthy of a solution.
A few days ago the president of the
Clark University made a statement,
frequently before noted, that "higher
education develops race suicide." The
science of sociology would, if it ex
isted, have on this statement a con
clusion of fact; substituted for a de
duction of surmise. It is difficult to
believe that "education is a cause ot
sterility." Would we not almost treat
M grotesque the statement that repro
duction, a biological factor, is neu
tralized by education, an acquired one?
The capabilities to reproduce' num
bers is not a result of education â
but the result of "knowledge"; and the
same "knowledge" in the uneducated
will produce a corresponding "steril
ity." This outcome of â¢knowledge"
is a new ethic; the phiy of the indi
vidual â absolutely indifferent of its
relationship to the species. It is to be
hoped that ere long the individual and
the species may have that scientific
unity which will insure and enable
the highest standard of possibility and
original design.WHAT WOMEN WANT TO KNOW

have chanced even to the
younger generation. Once
everything was based on the theory of
the simple life, but now it is quite the
reverse and the main object is to make
as much of I showing as Is possible in
every conceivable way. And even the
babies have not escaped. Theje used
to be a time, and a jolly old time it
was. too, when youngsters never both

eubljmely Indifferent as to what they

heart's content. And their mothers
were perfectly willing to turn them
loose in a led eallei/ or overalls to dab
ble until they could scarcely tell which

MIL.L.V (Negligee). â There are any

but as you discovered there is very apt
to be something radically wrong with
them. You say you are going to a

you Â«vill need the coolest fabric made
In a pretty way for afternoons. Wool
Is too warm and wash materials not
quite nice enough, so why not get a
heavy china silk. One of the pret
ties negligees, a bride's, by the way,
was made in two pieces. The skirt
was sun pleated and long and soft
The waist, or as I have always called
them, "josies," was pleated as well,
the waist and sleeves and all trimmed
with insertion and lace of a deep
cream. The neck was not low, but
just round finished, with a pretty

sailor collar. The sleeves were, of
course, elbow length and finished with
the insertion and lace. Made in a
pretty soft blue, or a delicate pink, it
is as pretty as anything I could sug
gest. One more this same girl had,
and it was pretty also. The color was
flesh and the fabric a surah, soft and
heavy. The back fitted snugly and
the flare commenced below the waist
line. The front was full and soft and
was finished with a double cascade of
lace down the front that fell to the
floor. The trimming was set in a
fanciful design and very effective it
was, too. If you cap. afford to, it
would be a good idea to have ona
made each way, but if one is your
limit I think the lirst would be more
practical. In the first place, it does
not appear go negligee and you would
not be obliged to gather your skirts
and flee If visitors came at an unex
pected hour.
JENNIE (About the New Blankets).
-There are fashions in blankets nowa
days Just as there are in table linen
and curtains and bed fittings. One
used to have blankets and comfort
ables just for warmth. There v,as
never much question of art effecta or
embroidery or becomlngness. But tuv
some time before this season it has
been decided that all' one's outfit de
nuit must be attractive and becom
ing. The American girl is making a
fad of dressing for herself. Back many
centuries ago women dressed to please
men; later In a higher state of civiliza
tion, as women grew cleverer and
more to be feared, they dressed for
each other, not so much to gain flat
tery as to avoid criticism. But to-day
it is herself that the American girl
dresses for, arid she cares as much
about the fittings of her own room,
her lounging gownr, her pretty night
robes and bed furnishings as she does
her dancing frocks and street suits. She
â¢wants to please her own good taste.
Her fad about blankets and comfort
ables is to have them all In one color
scheme, the one that is most becoming
to her and should dominate her bed
room.
Each winter bed is outfitted with one
pair of blankets, one silk or sateen
comfortable and with a single blanket
or throwover, which is used In place
of former crochet spread and crazy
quilts for a nap or for an invalid's
chair. Usually the blankets are white
with a striped border in the color
chosen, say pale blue, which is very
fashionable this year. The ends are
bound with wide Liberty satin ribbon
just the shade of the border. The
comfortable would b- of blue s%tln
with a wide border of blue, flowered
with whits and lavender lilacs with
branches uf the pale green May foliage
or with white fleur de lis or wistaria.
This is very thick and soft and made
up of eiderdown, light as a feather, and
thrown over the foot of the bed for
frosty nights. The extra single blanket
would be all pale blue, of real blanket
or very thick eiderdown cloth plain, or
lined with satin and bound with wide
catin ribbon. In one corner is a large
monogram embroidered with silk the
same shade or to match the flowers on
the comfortable.
These extra blankets embroidered
make very pretty wedding or Christ
mas presents, one that is beund to be
welcome, useful and artistic. As they
soil easily, they are usually put away
on a convenient shelf. They will wash,
of course, but are always prettier be
fore the laundry visit. Sometimes tho
double blankets are also the same
color, bound with white and the com
fortable matches. Or the entire out
fit, ribbon border and embroidery, is
all white. Naturally the keeping clean
of tht.'se delicately lined blankets is a
matter of great consideration. In fact,
if there was not some way of washing
them easily without fading they would
be a very extravagant household item.
It is no lc-nger considered hygienic to
dry clean blankets. It is known that
germs will'live for months in the fleecy
surface of woolen goods and that the
only way they can be really destroyed
is by the heat of the laundry. Hot
water, borax and sunshine are death
to germs. A very easy modern way to
clean blankets without fading or
shrinking is as follows:
FLU a tub full of warm water. If
you have a bath thermometer at hand
see that it registers 86 degrees. Add
two large tablespoonfuls of borax
and ertough white soap to make a
good stiffs. Throw a blanket in and
squeeze It gently. Do not wring with
the hands, and by no means should a
board be used, else the fleecy surface
will fluff up into little lumps and the
blanket be ruined. Rub through the
hands gently nnd send through a rub
ber wringer Into a second tub of water
of the same temperature and with the
borax and soap added. Each rinsing
water must be of the same tempera
ture. Dry quickly in the sun.
The palest tints can be washed in
thia way without injury and blankets
come out looking like new without
the drawn, haggard look that usual
laundry work induces. And to feel
sure that one's dainty bedroom fit
tings can be keot clean for years
without the least Injury or much ef
fort is to greatly increase one's en
joyment of them.
E. H. H. (Salads and Health).â lt
used to be considered very Frenchy
and foreign to have salad with dinner
or luncheon. Americans as a whole
wanted regularly their just deserts,
and a green leaf or two. more or leas
counted for very little. In the pie belt,
pastry was the necessary garnish for
every meaL Down South there were
always famous puddings for the com
plete epicure, and if a salad was served
at all a decade age, it was a ponder
ous meat affair of which an entire in
digestible meal was made. But to-day
we are a wiser and a sadder nation.
Pies and puddings have wrought out
their own punishment, and everywhere
the dyspeptic microbe Is lurking in our
midst, seeing what comfort and joy he
may devour. We have paid heavily
because we scorned the green leaf to
lighten our meals and sweeten our di
gestion.
Some of the most delicious Amer
ican salads are fruits and vegetables
mixed and aerved with cream dress*
ing. Apples make an ideal winter
salad chopped with celery, about one*
fourth, and then a few hickory nuts,
half a cup to a large bowl. The as
pics must be chopped the last thing
or they will discolor. This salad is
delicious with real Italian mayonnaise
or a cream dressing. And oranges
are delicious with celery, and apples
with pineapples, or an entire salad of
celery and mixed nuts, but this would
be a shade richer than a dyspeptic
would require. The most economical,
of all winter salads is cabbage, and
one of the most delicious. It should
be chopped tine Just before serving:
and a tablespoonful of fine chopped
onion and two of green peppers
should be added to a quart, then a
French or cream dressing, and all at
the expense of a few cents.
An excellent variation from th* plain
French dressing of oil. vinegar and salt
is as follows: Half a teaspoonful of
salt, a pinch of sugar, eighth of a
teaspoonful of paprika, a few drops Â»f
tobasco sauce, add quarter of a cup
of vinegar and slowly drop in oil until
it thickens, beating all the time. A
simple cream dressing where oil is not
relished is made with very little trou
ble and Is delicious. Take the juice of
a lemon, ir.;x with half a teaapoonful
of sugar and salt, and the white ot a
beaten egg, then drop in rich cream
slowly so that it will not curdle. Servo
cold.
One reason possibly that Americans
were slow to acquire a real relish of
salads may have been because of thÂ«
fear of devouring insects and microbes
along with green leaves. It seems to
difficult to get anything that Js un
cooked thoroughly, hyglenically whole
some. But the London doctors seem to
have solved the difficulty by ordering
all greens, eaten in hospitals or by
their patients anywhere, to be washed
In a weak solution of borax water.
Of course the purest bora% must be
used and the solution must bÂ« al
ways fresh. Half a teaspoonful of
borax powder to â¢ basin of fresh water
Is about the right proportion. Bach
leaf should be separately dipped up
and down several times to Insure per
fect cleanness and rinsed in clear
water If convenient. Though If th*
greens were not rinsed no harm
would be done, as the borax solution
is absolutely without injurious prop
erties, and would, in fact, be a whole
some wash for mouth and throat.
Well prepared and artistically
served salads have a threefold valtre
to the wise housekeepers. They ar*
the moat wholesome of foods, the
most economical, the easiest to pre
pare and the most appetising in ap
pearance. As a rule children are very
fond of them and they tempt the ap
petite of weary jaded workers ss no
other dish I can think of. Surely
nothing for the same money can of
fer so many epicurean virtues.

who weighs fifty-two pounds,
has a chest that measures when
expanded. twenty-five and
one-quarter inches, who can
hold over his head two dumbbells
weighing fifteen pounds each, and you
have the most remarkable youngster
in the State of California.
Roger Cornell Jr. is his name and
he is a native son. He also wears a
mixe 7 hat. This extraordinary meas
urement of the lad's head is not due
to adulation showered on him by ad
mirers, but to the mental a.nd physi
cal training he has undergone since
his birth.
When this wonderful boy came into
ihi6 world he weighed eleven and one
half pounds. Exercise, regular hours
and proper food have made him what
he is to-day, a. handsome specimen
of boyhood and an object k-.sson to
the world. His only illness was a
slight attack of chicken-pox. It was
a mild case, as the lusty youngster
resisted the disease in iis early stages.
"Baby" Cornell is always happy
when in a gymnasium and will tackle
any form of exercise and never tire.
If he is oermitted to enter the swim
ming tank he is the last to leave and
if forcibly withdrawn his cries will
attest his love of water. Each morn
ing he goes through his calisthenics
and has a cold Ehower bath. His life
. is a regular one and is guarded with
rreat care by his athletic father and
mother.
If "Baby" Cornell is asked what he
expects to be when he grows up he
does not dilate on his hopes of being
President or of startling the world
with some new discovery in medicine,
but modestly says: "I want to be an
athlete and a champion." This is a
laudable ambition and if he follows
â¢in the footsteps of his parental an
cestor, who is trainer of athletes of
the Olympic Club, the youngster will
indeed be a champion, for the parent
has held during his life a dozen titles
for athletic supremacy.
If properly trained and developed
along physical culture lines the boy
bids fair to become a noted athlete or
strong man. He is full of grit and
does not fear injury. If he falls and
bruises himself never a whimper
leaves his tightly closed lips, as he
has been taught by his father that to
co' is an indication of cowardice and
"'Baby" Cornell would rather suffer
torture than be adjudged a craven.

NATIVE WINES AND THEIR FUTURE
â²ddrese by Percy T. Morgan, President
of the California Wine Growers'
Association, Before the Fruit Grow
ers' Convention.
THE future of the California wine
industry is largely bound up in
the earnest co-operation of the
various elementsâ growers, wine
makers and wine dealers â in promoting
a more general use of wine.
Each element r.ow stands aloof on its
own ground and does not appear to
have any Interest beyond the immedi
ate disposal of the product from hand
to hand.
There is no "promotion committee" in
the wine industry for the extension of
ite business. The grape grower, when
ht has sold his grapes, lets it rest there.
The wine maker, when he has made
disposition of his wines to the large
dealers, thinks his mission has then
ceased; and the large dealer, in his
turn, when he has turned his wines
over to the merchant and Jobber, says
"Amen."
It seems to be forgotten that the
wholesale liquor dealer deals in other
products than wine. Most of them
carry w?nes practically as a side line.
Their particular interest is in the whis
kies and other spirituous liquors which
they distribute more largely than wine.
In this country, where wine drinking
' incidental instead of general.
as in the large wine-producing coun
tries of Europe, wine shops where only
light wines containing naturally fer
mented alcohol are offered appear to
be a commercial impossibility, because
there are not sufficient patrons who are
exclusively users of wine to make such
an enterprise profitable.
The native wine business, therefore,
is inextricably mixed up with the
larger whisky interests, which the
wholesale liquor dealer is compelled to
combine in order to render his capital
and labor remunerative.
The gallonage consumption of whisky
In this 1 country, per capita, is three
try. Wholesome food is more to his
liking and his well-nourished body
attests that he eats properly.

?H J,u d v there is no doubt that the
lad will become a great swimmer in
course of time. At present the baby
times as much as the wine consump
tion. This appears extraordinary when
it is considered that wine is a bever
age, while whisky is used lasgely as a
stimulant. When a man takes a con
vivial drink it is usually whisky or
beer.
The vital question to-day in the wine
business is. How shall we popularize
the consumption of healthful native
wines, as beer and whisky have been
popularized?
The answer which first comes to the
mind is to advertise the benefits to be
derived from wine, as compared with
whisky, beer err other beverage.
Among the largest advertisers in the
ccuntry are the beer interests. They
htve made it pay else they could not
continue the enormous expenditure for
bringing the attention of the public to
their product. The whisky men also
are large advertisers. We can hardly
turn in a street car or to a board fence
or take up the daily newspaper with
out seeing the advertisement of this
and that brand of whisky. The ad
vertisements are got up tastily to catch
the eye. The public sees this or that
brand of whisky or beer constantly ad
vertised and comes to believe largely
from such advertising in the excellence
of the advertised article.
Patent medicines containing alcohol
are also very largely consumed. They
"would not be consumed, they could not
reach the public, unless they were
properly advertised.
The question which arises, therefore,
So/Ji i â¢ c . onsum Ption of beer has
reached eighteen gallons per annum
per capita and of whisky one and a
half gallons per annum par capita
while wine in the United States is only
credited with one-half gallon per an
num per capita, whether the low con
sumption of wine is not somewhat due
to the fact that the public attention
Ls not properly called to its merits?
Then again the question arises if
publicity will help the consumption of
native wines who shall pay for this
publicity?
The mere advertising of California
wines as California wines, without at
taching any particular brand to themâ
and this, after all, is the only method
whereby the public can, through arti

down and then this healthy boy is
ready for breakfast. The first meal
consists of eggs, toast, mush and milk
and coffee. Roger is then allowed to
pi ay with his companions, 'who- look
cles in the newspapers, be educated up
to the drinking of wineâ would not ben
efit any particular house or firm except
as it benefited the industry in general,
so no particular concern or firm could
afford to undertake an advertising
campaign for the benefit of California
wines in general. It must be done, if
done at all, by the industry at large,
each contributing his share of the gen
eral fund. Then if some firms prefer
to advertise their individual brands as
being better and more carefully aged
and matured than the general run of
California wines their advertising
would reach an already educated public
mind and bear such fruit as no indi
vidual effort could otherwise command.
The success of the advertisement of
individual brands would, by reflex ac
tion, also benefit the general industry,
because the higher the price obtained
for the individual brand the greater
stimulus and impetus would be given
to the growing of the better varieties
of grapes and the general uplifting of
the tone of the industry.
Eastern wine men are finding that it
pays to advertise; that it pays to bring
to the attention of the individual the
excellence of their product; and in in
vestigating material for the prepara
tion of an address which I lately made
before the International Pure Food
Congress at St. Louis, I was surprised
to find that almost one-third of the
sparkling wine, or so-called cham
pagne, consumed in this country was of
native origin. More than a dozen
brands of Eastern champagne are be
ing regularly advertised and largely
consumed. The quality of the product
is being improved every year. The cel
lars and methods are being constantly
enlarged upon.
Some brands of Eastern still wines
are also being advertised, and cne I
have particularly in mind appears to
have a very extended popularity.
There is no reason why California
wines should not also have a vogue in
the houses of the wealthy, for there
are inherent qualities in a propprly
made and matured California wine
which make it is good as any wine on
the face of the globe.
There is, of in California a
'THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CAUI
large amount of ordinary wine made,
and it is necessary that this should be
the case, for the man who drinks wine
habitually at his meals is usually a
foreigner who has acquired the habit
from his childhood days, and in order
to continue in the use of his beverage
he must obtain it at a reasonable
figure.
This Is the man who haa been the
backbone of the California wine indus
try. He thoroughly appreciates that
nowhere in the world can he get as
pure and sound and generally excellent
an article as the California wine that
is made readily available to him at a
reasonable figure all over the United
States; but this man, as I have said
before, must get his beverage reason
ably. It must be so available and cheap
to him as to permit him to make it an
article as usual and necessary on his
table as is bread or salt. To raise the
price to this consumer would be the
height of folly, for it would alienate
the greatest friend of the California
wine industry- and induce him to turn
to other channels for his daily bever
age.
The born wine drinker does not need.
to be educated; he is already a con
vert. He does not need to tbe adver
tised to, because he himself will seek
the beverage he has always been ac
customed to, and if it is good and rea
sonable in price will continue its use. It
is to those who do not habitually use
wine, but who, by reason of those arti
cles continually being called to their
attention, constantly keep whisky or
beer in their houses for social occa
sions. A campaign of education through
the daily newspapers and magazines
would go a great way to accustom such
people to - call instead for California
wines.
It does not seem impossible that an
annual trade of one million cases of
high grade California wines could be
attained in the United States, when
you come to consider that this would
be less than one-seventh of a bottle
per annum per capita of the popula
tion, but the sale of such a quantity
of fine grade wines would immensely
stimulate the general value of Cali
fornia vineyards, for instead of the
merchant considering a profit of two,
or three, or five cents per gallon as a
satisfactory goal to be reached, he
upon him as a leader. He instructs all
the youngsters on the block how to
wrestle and do gymnastic tricks and
they are all benefiting by his teaching.
Although very precocious, the boy has
not been spoiled. His father will not
permit him to be coddled, as he wants
him to be manly and helpful to others.
A light luncheon, followed by a
siesta In the afternoon and then he ia
given an hour's mental exercise.
Roger is a bright boy and learns
rapidly. He talks? fluently and cor
rectly and he does not play the
"baby."
After supper the boy is taken in
hand by his athletic father, who
teaches him to box and wrestle. Mr.
Cornell remembers that when he was
a boy at school he had to suffer many
indignities at the hands of older boys
and he intends teaching his son to
take care of himself. He will not ad
vise the youth to play the "bully,"
but to protect the weak. These prin
ciples he is inculcating in the boy's
mind and exnects good results.
Roger is unlike most buys of his age.
The average lad has quite a paunch,
but the little fellow has by exercise rid
himself of the superfluous stomach and
now shapes up like an athlete. He has
a ridge of muscle over his stomach, and
in wrestling these muscles come into
play. The boy can "bridge"â that is,
form an arc by resting on his hands
and feet and hold a fifteen-pound
dumbbell on his little body. He knows
all about "half-Nelsons," "hammer
locks" and the other intricate holds
used in wrestling, and he puts them
into play in his bouts.
Give him a pair of gloves and some
thing to punch and he is, indeed, hap
py. He uses both hands like an expert,
and his blows are not baby taps. The
little arms are well muscled and the
shoulders are exceedingly broad for one
of his age. He has a punching bag
that he pounds each day, and its con
stant use is developing the lad's back
muscles.
The average man has a chest expan
sion of two inches, while this youth can
expand his little chest two and a quar
ter inches. His biceps expansion is one
inch, while the ordinary baby has none
at all.
would look, by the lessening of tha
unit from a gallon to a bottle, to live
or six times this profit per gallon.
He would then be glad to pay more
for his initial grapes or wines, because
with public appreciation assured he
would know practically to a cent
what he was going to get for the aged
and matured wines in his cellars.
To-day no such assurance exists. He
may, Ijelieving that the outlook Justi
fies it, pay in one vintage a large price
for grapes and wine only to find that
succeeding heavy crops have so de
preciated the value of the stock of
wines in his cellars as to bring him
face to face practically with bank
ruptcy. He is not willing under such
conditions to take these chances. It
is not a commercial proposition. It
therefore resolves itself into a question
not how much can he pay for wines
for holding and maturing, but how
can he get them for so as to
minimize his chance of loss?
We are a long way. however, from
shipping any such quantity of cased
wine. Statistics of railroad and steam;
er shipments show that such wines
sent from California rarely reach in
any year 50,000 cases, while bulk ship
ments reach nearly 18,000.000 gallons.
This means practically, therefore,
that the reputation of California wines
is left solely in the hands of the East
ern wholesale handler in bulk, who
may or may not bottle It with the care
and attention which all fine wines need,
who may or may not give the wines
the necessary time in bottle which is
absolutely requisite to the develop
ment of the finer qualities, the smooth
ness and the bouquet which character
ize the better brands of wine from
abroad.
In a word, nearly all this is left to
the commercialism of handlers who
do not depend solely upon California
wines for their business success, but
who most frequently handle also for
eign and Eastern wines and are pri
marily whisky handlers.
Should not the reputation of the
finer California vintage wines be more
jealously guarded by Californians?
The renowned Chateau wines of
France and the Schloss wines of Ger
many would never have attained the
value and reputation which they hold

That physical culture is invaluable
to human beings has already been
proven. That it has worked wonders
for the father and - mother of s this fu

The father is a magnificent specimen
of manhood. His muscles have been
developed by swimming, wrestling,
boxing, bicycle-riding and other ath
letics. He is looked upon as one -of
the best trainers in the country and
he has developed men who have "won
fame in the world of athletics. Mrs.
Cornell was a slight woman, but un

has taken up exercising and within

California is yet young, but to gain
a national reputation for her wines*
she must emerge from swaddlinff
clothes and take on the garb of a
man; she must follow in the footsteps
of older countries and adopt their
methods.
There are magnificent wines to-day
in the cellars of California which
have been carefully selected and prop
erly aged and matured, but the great
consuming public in the East will not.

miles to obtain them. "If the moun
tain will not come to Mahomet. Ma
homet must go to the mountain." And
se must we carry our wares in the
most attractive form to the consumer
in order to have them properly appre
ciated.
The direct marketing of these finer
wines should not and will not inter
fere with the present business of those
who now distriubte California wines;
on the contrary, the sale of all Cali

not fail to be benefited by a public ap
preciation of fine wines properly aged
and matured in bottle in California
cellars. For such winea the public
will, when properly educated regard

To effect all this, however, concerted
action ia necessary. It is estimated
that over eighty million dollars are at
stake in the grape growing and wine
industry of the State. Cannot this
eighty million dollars contribute ac
cording to the benefit derived by each
element in the business? It must do
so if it is desired to avoid the violent
fluctuations' in wine and grape vames
which now are common.
It" vineyardists want grapes to rule

the distributors to obtain a stable price
for the aged and matured article;
otherwise a hand-to-mouth policy must
continue to permeate the industry. No
longer can each afford to stand in hia
own corner and refuse "to play in the
other's backyard." It is only by co
operation of all the elements that any
considerable and permanent success
can be attained.WITH THE

lence; one is released from a fifteen
year term in prison and departs for
newer scenes; one is left in the work
house, and one, "The Secret Woman,"
is left against the lonely background
to live a life of atonement- - And" yet
it is a story that is intensely human,
for it deals with problems that are
vital and omnipresent. It is not a
novel; the author himself in his dedi
cation frankly calls it a tragedy. As
â¢ such it attains at times a tremendous
stress in Its portrayal of the turmoil
and tribulations that assail the hearts
and souls of a simple country folk who
order their affairs and settle their
problems according to the dictates of
primary emotions.
The bald theme of the book 1 is the
flesh and the Bins of the flesh. It
touches upon questions and problems
that are as innate in the lives of peo
ple of the so-called higher order of so
ciety as they are in the lives of the
simple granite cutters and flockmasters
of Devon. Only here they are dis
played in all their nakedness, ac
knowledged, when faults, without art
or artifice, and the price paid,
without equivocation. So when the
wife of. Anthony Redvers discovers
his relations with the secret woman,
he, simple, -straightforward, can only
say: "Angry you must be, . of ' course,
according to your lights, but 'tis like
your pluck to hide it. Well, all's up.
No wife could forgive or understand.
What's your will?" And again: "I've
got a decent soul in me, Ann, what
ever you may think. I never once
went near our old love walks â nor near
the places you liked in the old time
when now and again you could find
half an hour for a stroll. Never once.
'. They're just as holy to me now as
they wen- twenty years agone." *"I
,'>yiEh to Godâ but that's! vain now.
bals' I*ve been steadfast as the polestar
for all your doubting. The way of a
man's body is nothing if his heart is
-it."
Because he is of amorous tempera
' nient and is mated with a woman who
held^tne most trivial display of affec
tion a 4 weakness, Anthony Redvers
strays from the plain path of marital
rectitude. Loving his wife with his
whole heart and soul, still this man
pays his secret ' court from home.
Finally his defect in duty is discovered
by his wife. Before her accusation he
protests his great love for her still
and then can say no more. He appre
ciates that she cannot take the same
view of It that he does, and so he
silently stands and waits for her word
to him to go. This scene, the strong
est in the book, is enacted in the old
fashioned living room of the Redver's,
to the fit accompaniment of the storm
that is beating and roaring without.
The soul of the man and the soul of
the woman, after the denunciation, are
bare.
Even then, moved by the earnestness
of his simple, honest defense, stirred
by the old love, she is moved to say
that it he will give up the womanâ
"The Secret Woman"â will forgive
him. But he, gating into the fire, hears
nothing of her words because of a furi
ous blast of the storm rattling the win
dow panes, and she, - thinking he has
heard and rejects, finds her generous
love turned to hate. Then he in his
turn makes his appeal to her. but she.

men. Thousands of good men are in,
and they need the others who are not
in. More would- come if - they knew
how much they 'were needed." " In this
wise does Booth * Tarkington begin' the
foreword to his latest book, "In the
Arena." â ; ? <v .; ; â :..â¢'. â¢
"In the Arena" is, r as its name might
imply, concerned with politics. it is,
a collection of six short stories in which
the material used runs the gamut from
the Mayor arid municipal boss to the
pettiest ward heeler and latest im
ported "citizen." Nothing that Booth
Tsrkington does can fail of interest,
and these six stories, while there is no
one of them that is signally a great
short story, are most entertaining and
enjoyable reading, especially when,
written by a man who was in the poli
tical game himself and received his
material first hand.
y By one of his characters, politics is
eulogized thusly: .
"Yet I just can't seem to keep out
of it. There's a good many like me,
too, not out for oflice or contracts or
anything that you can put your finger
on in particularâ nothing except the
game. Of course it's a pleasure know
ing that you've got more influence than
some, but I believe the most ' you" ever
get out of it is being able to help your
friends, to get a man you like a job,
or a good contract, or something he
wants when he- needs it." That is the
sense of the story that holds the place
of honor in the book, ."Boss Gorgett."
In "BossGbrgett" the .bosses of the
opposing factions" play the game as
they know the game, with a certain
admiration . for each other, and a cer-~
tain grim enjoyment of ; the 'gains and
losses -and of the* checks and counter
checks that each scores â¢ against the
other. The little, half hidden chords of
human interest, that this writer knows
so well how to uncover and play upon, .
are here: '"Boss Gorge tt,"' a despot
with a city under his thumb,' is shown
with moist- eye before the spectacle of
a young and ambitious man, howbeit
somewhat priggish, pitilessly, crushed
by the machinations of a game for
which he was too. weak. The story
centers around young Farwell Knowles,
the reform candidate for Mayor, and
the manipulations of Boss Gorgett that
encompassed his defeat a week before
the election day.
r "The Aliens" - occupies the â  second
place in the book, although it may well
have held the place of honor. It :
gets- right down into the freshly
naturalized elements of a crowded
"foreign ward" for its material, and the
story of the love of.Pietro the chestnut
vender for Bertha the waitress -. is
ttuchingly pathetic. After months 'of
skimping- and saving to lay aside a
marriage portion of five hundred dol
lars, the glad day at last comes. But
election day. is coming, too. and Pixley

Pletro and his live Italian cousins and

But Pietro is an ingrained Re

The six votes are essential. They must
be voted for his ticket or Pixley must
keep them from the polls altogether.
This he does in a way that reflects un
dying credit to his executive genius.
He contrives to .have a negro affected
with smallpox escape from his quar
antined house and ' take refuge in the
cellar where Pietro dwells. Comes then
to the scene an officer who calls for

with human interest, for it draws its
material from the lowest order of cos

human emotions and passions in simple
unschooled lives. :It is the â¢ very oppo- '

Violin Lore
By an Enthusiast
V % IOLIN enthusiasts may simply
MJ revel in their native element, that
*^ composite of love, reverence and
admiration which they bear for their
chosen instrument, if they will but
read "The Story of the Violin," by
Paul Stoeving, professor of violin at
the Guildhall School of Music in Lon
don. The book is the fifth of a music
story series imported by Charles
Scribner's Sons. It is a most concise
conx^i^aiion of facts and anecdotes
on the violin, and while it will fascin
ate players, it will doubtless have
much of interest even for those whose
profune hands have never known the
joy of a personal knowledge of thÂ»s
instrument.
The author begins at the very be
ginning and where the real historical
thread is broken he enlists tradition.
In searching for the beginning of the
violin family, he says: "It is like
standing on a high mount trying to
distinguish objects in the valleys and
plains below ever which evening has
already rolled the thick white feather
beds for the night. Here and there
a glimpse through the fog â a lighted
window far, far away, where Tradition
sits spinning her eternal threads, and
that is all."
The volume is redolent of the must
of India, the first bowed instrument.
From there the story runs to the
Arabian and European rebab*, the
Welsh crwth down to the wonders of
Cremona that "burst upon the world
in a perfection which human wit has
never since been able to improve up
on." He says: "Theirs was the
robin's Bong in March, ushering: in the
new spring; the lovely flrst-fruit of
a new age, a new dispensation, a new
spirit on the carth â not only the spirit
of modern musical art, but the spirit
of a more enlightened, spiritualized
humanity, of greater charity and gen
eral brotherhood."
And so on with all the romanticism
worthy of the subject, until even the
cynical layman who may come to scoff
must remain to pray. The writer tells
how the violin in its mission has pene
trated to the quarters of the earth, car
rying its sweet influence into the pal
ace and the hut. Inspiring great minds
to composition and thereby being the
origin of much that is beautiful in the
â world rather than merely being the
means of Interpreting the beautiful.
"It has the voice of an angel, yet ring
ing with the dear, familiar sounds of
earth, with earthly passions, Joys and
woes and ecstacies. Intensely human
and yet bo superhuman that the soul
is seized with hopeless longing to fol
low it. Yes, indescribably sweet voice,
where thou endest, the music of the
spheres begins. Or is it that, perhaps,
which rises from the petals of flowers
in wondrous exhalations, half-perfume
and half -melody, and, trembling in the
sunlight, draws the bee the way to the
honey?" And again: "When the heart
is so full that it cannot contain its full
ness any longer It flows over in tears
or in melodies; this is the beginning of
all true music."
He takes ub wandering over Europe
with the early minstrels and trouba
dours and says: "Had music been left
entirely to the learned who labored be
hind gloomy cloister walls perhaps it
would have come down to us like Chi
nese music, dried up, a mummy instead
of a thing of life and beauty."
The intense love and reverence of
the artist writer for his instrument is
apparent in his description of a Stradl
varlus: "Behold the fine flbÂ«r of the
wood shining through the varnish like
the delicate roses through my lady's
finger nails! No wonder people love a
violin like that, and yearn and starve
themselves for it, and many a fair
maiden, pretending only to inspect the
wood, has ere long (no one seeing)

Negro
Problem Discussed
JOME twelve months or more aeo
the President of the United States
gave an ordinarily simple White
House "home luncheon" that has be
come historical.
Whether he intended it so or not.
President Roosevelt's invitation to
Booker Washington to come around to
lunch the next day, meet two or three
people he ought to know and talk
things over socially and as man to
man, seems to have become a ghastly
white milestone on a hitherto care
fully shadowed road.
The next day and for days thereafter
the country rang with comment on the
President's idiosyncrasy, to put it mild
ly â insult, to voice the sentiment south
of the Mason and Dixon line.
Now, a year after, we are given a
volume begotten in fear and righteous
wrath and worked out in the travail
of intimate knowledge. The daily
papers would give but one page, the
magazines but fifteen pages â and the
subject was limitlessâ hence the vol
ume.
"In the controversy precipitated by
the luncheon at the White House and
embittered by more recent procedures,
the attitude of the South presents an
element of the pathetic. The great
world is apparently hopelessly against
her," says William Benjamin Smith
of Tulane University of Louisiana.
This is the opening paragraph of "The
Color Line, a Brief in Behalf of the
Unborn," and all the remainder of the
276 pages of pleas and counter-pleas,
statistics, histories and prophecies
streams out from that ingenuous
fount.
According to Mr. Kmith that lunching
together of two public men, each a
leader, a reformer and a doer of great
deeds in the eyes of the world; men of
similar attainments and aims, though
of dissimilar color and racial charac
teristics, opens the door to social
equality and inevitable miscegenation
and deterioration of the South.
The women of the southland are not
taken Into consideration as responsible
factors, "Many bright mulattoes would
ambitiously woo, and not a few would
win, well-bred women disappointed in
love or goaded by Impulse or weary of
the stern struggle for existence. As a
race the Southern Caucausian would be
irreversibly doomed. No other con
ceivable disaster that might befall the
South could, for an instant, compare
with miscegenation within her borders
âneither flood nor fire, fever, famine
nor the sword, nor even Ignorance, in
dolence nor carpet-baggery. Therefore
is the South Justified in this absolute
denial of social equality to the negro,
no matter what his virtues or abilities
or accomplishments."
Men and women of the North will
find it difficult to comprehend the pes
simistic view Mr. Smith gives us of
the "simple-hearted milkmaid or some
schoolma'am past her bloom" grate
fully succumbing to the wedded state
with the "olive-colored suitor."
True, grand old Fred Douglass with
his . mahogany ' skin and snow-white
crown, was a conspicuous figure In
Washington circles as United States
Marshal, and he had for his second ;
wife a white woman who was equally
well received ., because of ' her brains,
her grace, and her tactful reserve. But

tion and a Northern exception. ;We had

Briefer Mention.
>Â» BOOK of considerable interest
H> to churchmen is the new trans
*** lation by Rev. John Faulkner
Potts of "The Four Doctrines" of
Swedenborg, the first volume of the
American Swedenborg Printing and
Publishing Society's new edition of
Swedenborg's theological works. The
advent of the new book brings up the
question as to the place held by Swed
enborg in the history of theology.
Emanuel Swedenborg was a Swedish
nobleman, scientist and philosopher,
born January 29, 1688. He died March
29, 1772. During the period of his
scientific activity he was considered
one of the ablest and most prominent
men of his country, was a trusted
counselor of the King and a friend of
well-known scientists of that day, such
as Linnaeus, Polhem and others. His
scientific writings, principally on
physics, anatomy and physiology, were
voluminous and were far in advance of
his time. But Swedenborg's claim to
distinction lies in the fact that he
claimed to have been the divinely
chosen and prepared instrument
through which the inner or heavenly
meaning of the word of the Lord was
revealed. Swedenborgianism, as pro
fessed by Swedenborg's followers, is
based on the beliefs of Swedenborg's
claims to have witnessed the last judg
ment, or the second advent of the
Lord, with the inauguration of the
new church through the new system
of doctrine promulgated by him and
derived from the Scriptures, into the
true sense of which he was the first
to be introduced.
The four doctrines embraced by the
book are: (1) "The Doctrine of the
Lord," which is a careful analysis of
the Scripture respecting Jesus Christ
and an explanation of the trinity; (2)
"The Doctrine of the Sacred Scrip
ture," which unfolds the doctrine of
the spiritual sense in its relation with
the literal and the way in which the
true doctrine is deduced from Scrip
ture; XS) "The Doctrine of Faith," and
(4) "The Doctrine of Life." which is a
careful analysis of the relations of
morals of good conduct to spiritual
life. It also contains an exposition of
the spiritual sense of the Ten Com
mandments. The book further con
tains the nine questions originally pro
pounded to Swedenborg by the Rev.
Thomas Hartley, M. A., with the an
swers of Swedenborg. They relate
chiefly to the Lord, the Trinity and the
Holy Spirit.

While one needs more than the
usual stock of optimism to 1 enthuse
over a dictionary, if enthusiasm i 3
ever to be excited by any work so
prosy, it will surely be from the new
library edition of Webster's Standard
Dictionary. It comes to hand all

award of the St. Louis Exposition,

A little drama In the original Span
ish from the pen of Pedro Caldoron
de la Barca, a celebrated verse writer
of old Madrid in the 17th century, has
bÂ«en received. It is entitled "La Vida
Bs Sueno" and is intended for ad
vanced students. Like most of the
Spanish dramas of that time the treat
ment of the story is strongly religious.
The author uses as a motif tMe ulti
mate control of the natural man
through an appeal to his obligations
to his fellow men, and shows the van
ity of indulging human passions and
the necessity of meriting eternal bliss.

Among the thousands of amusing let
ters which enliven the monotony of the
publisher's existence came recently an
undated request from a Western city,
written, it goes without saying, by a
woman, and expressed concisely in the
following words: "I want an interest
ing book to read, -Please send me one.
If 1 don't like it. I will send it back."
Perhaps the day will come when pub
lishers will have "sample departments,"
where fragments of books will be sub
mitted to women, with fac similes of
cover, etc., from which the ladies may
choose volumes for their libraries as
they now select materials for their
gowns. It is a painful, because an un
familiar, experience to a woman to buy
anything that she cannot "send back"
if she changes her mind after she has
ordered the goods. All dry goods
houses recognize and submit to this
idiosyncrasy on the part of women,
and since books are read by women in
America far more than by men, possi
bly the sale of books might be in
creased if there were not such an
alarming finality in their purchase that
a woman stops to think before invest
ing.
That remarkable little book on "Op
timism" â the life creed of its still more
remarkable writer, Helen Kellerâcon
tinues to excite comment, both in this
country and in England. Its publish
ers, Thomas Y. Crowell & Co., state
that its sales were larger in 1904 than
in 1903, the year it first appeared. "Op
timism" is the inspiration of a poem by
Richard Watson Gilder in the January
Century apropos of a copy of the book
sent him by Joseph Jefferson.
Bookmaking in the United States has
been prosperous and increasingly ac
tive, according to the careful statistics
gathered by the Publishers' Weekly
and produced In its number of January
28. The total output of new books and
new editions advanced from 7865 In 1903
to 8291 in 1904, an increase of 426; but
the increase in new books alone was
much more marked, being from 5793 to
6971, or 1178, while the new editions fell
off about 750. This is a fairly favorable
showing for the mental fertility of our
writers and the demand for their pro
duct.
Sir William Magnay has laid the
scenes of his new romance of adven
ture, "A Prince of Lovers," In Walda
via and Beroldstein, names which
hide the identity of two of the many
independent German states which ex
isted for the greater part of two cen
turies, after the close of the Thirty
Years' War. Sir William Magnay is
favorably known as the author of
"The Red Chancellor," and other
novels. M A Prince of Lovers" will be
published In March by Little, Brown

Literary Notes.
(( Â»TANCY STAIR." by Elinor
/V Macartney Lane, is being
dramatized by the author in
collaboration with Paul M. Potter.
whose work in dramatizing "Trilby,"
the former great success, is well
known. According to the present plans
the play will be put on at the Hud
son Theater March 13 and Mary Man
nering will play the title role. Re
hearsals will begin next month, and the
play is expected to go to London in the'
fall season. Curiously enough, it was
not Mary Mannering, but Maude Adams,
who was the first to perceive the full
dramatic possibilities of the book.
Some one sent her a copy for Christ
mas and "she read it and DromDtly
wrote to Charles Frohman that she had
discovered the material for a erreat
play. The manager was delighted ir
turn and delegated Frank McKee to
find a dramatlzer. The latter discov
ered that Paul M. Potter was in New
York and willing to undertake the task,
and the matter was promptly settled.
The title role should be a success.
Nancy, the heroine, has been deseribtd
by the critics as "the adorable, spoiled,
magnificent maid."
"Is a city or a country residence the
more congenial to the literary tempera
ment?" was recently asked Elmer
Elliott Peake, author of "The House of
Hawley," which the Appletons publish
this month.
"Tastes differ, of course," answered
Mr. Peake. "Most authors, It would
seem, live lr> cities: and there seems to
be a tendency cityward amons authors
living in the country, especially after
they have made a ten-strike. The city
affords lectures, concerts, drama, so
ciety and the fellowship of kindred
spirits â all sources of inspiration. Still
there is a great il^al to be said for the
other sid.\ "Witness the famous au
thors living a rural or semi-rural
life. There is inspiration in nature â
in trees, flowers and birds, of the un
sophisticated variety not to be found
in city parks. I don't know what I
should do without my dally stroll In
the country- Perhaps the ideal resi
dence Is in a small town near a city,
which in a measure combines the ad
vantages of both."
A third printing of "Mysterious Mr.
Sabin," by E. Phillips Oppenheim, la
announced by Little, Brown & Co. A
Chicago critic warns persons against
reading this novel of love, intrigue and
adventure at night, saying: -'You can't
sleep till you have read it all, and then
you are certain not to sleep at all."
On the other hand, a discriminating
Now York reviewer asserts that "Mys
terious Mr. Sabin" is the kind of book
"to make a man forget to grumble over
rapid transit that is not rapid and
ferry connections that do not con
nect."
Cyrus Townaend Brady gives some
interesting war statistics in his new
bcok, "The Conquest of the South
west." which the Appletons publish
this month.
"We paid." he says, in speaking of
the conquest of Mexico, "about $130
for each square mile of territory, or
$32 for each member of the popula
tion to-day. It will be safe to call It
$170,000,000 In ail.
"It has been estimated that the cost
of the Revolution was upward of
$170, 000,000. We paid France for the
Louisiana purchase $15,000,000. The
price of Alaska was $7,200,000. and
the Philippines cost us $20,000,000 la
cash to Spain, besides the terrible c*Â»
penses of the war.
"Suppose," he continues, "convinced!
that we must have this (Mexican) ter
ritory to round out and complete our
national domain, that we had gone t*>
Mexico and offered her twenty-fire,
fifty, seventy-flve or even one hundred
millions of dollars! Ws would have
been greatly the gainer from a finan
cial point of view even If she had de
manded the highest figure."
Charles D. Stewart's book. The
Fugitive Blacksmith," will be pub-.
lished by the Century Company Feb
ruary 13. It is interesting to know
that this man of 37 has held steadily
to an ideal of authorship since boy
hood, though a wandering life was
forced upon him for many years. For
the last twelve years he has been an
engraver in Chicago, part of the time
an official of the Photo Engravers'
Union.
Hall Calne. whose latest book "The
Prodigal Son" was published late in
the fall by the Appletons, was recently
asked to put the gist of his book in a
few words.
"What is the great underlain* mo
tive?" he was asked.
"Do we get our deserts." replied tne
author.
"The parable of the Prodigal Son la
the most human and beautiful of the
parables of Christ, but, perhaps, it is
also the most perplexing. Has it ever
occurred to you to ask yourself T/hat
would be the result if its incidents
were transferred to real life and its
teaching were accepted as an example
of conduct among men? If a good
father could so spell a son by over
indulgence what would be the conse
quence? If a son. after wasting his
substance in riotous living and coming
down to the condition in which 'no
man will give unto him,' could return
home and be completely foi given and
taken back into the full enjoyment of
the position he has forfeited, what
would be the effect? If an elder
brother who has lived a righteous life
could be superseded in the end by si
ycunger brother who has lived an evil
life, what would be the result? Would
rot the social order be disturbed?
Would not all the ordinary laws of life
bÂ«> violated? Could law and order be
maintained in a community in which
such things were possible? In short.
would not civilization be reduced to
something like chaos?"
Dr. Louis Livingston Seaman will
have almost as many cases of cham
pagne at his disposal at the Savage
Club in London any time he chooses to
drop in there as there are newspaper
correspondents in Tokio.
Four months ago, when Dr. Bea
man was in the Japanese capital, he
made four attempts to enter Port
Arthur. Then he returned to Tokio
and wagered a case of champagne
with all comers that the redoubtable
fcrtress would not fall before tne
flYst of the year. There were many
takers, an-1 so confident were some of
the correctness of their views that
they even advanced the date. Some
bets had it that the fortress was to fail
before the end of September. Dr. Sea
man has won every bet, as Port Ar
thur did not surrender until the Ist
cf January, 1905. This is one of the
â¢ninor incidents that Dr. Seaman fail
ed to mention in his book "From To
kio Through Manchuria With the Ja
panese," which has Just been publish
ed by the Appletons.

LONDON, Feb. 26.â T0 her friends it
is known that if Lady Curzon had her
choice she would not return to India.
For diplomatic reasons, however, she
is bound to go. When she last re
turned to London she made no secret
of the fact that she was heartily sick
of Indian life. The climate does not
agree v. ith her and she declares that
her ambitionÃ are satisfied and that
â  ehe would rather settle down in a quiet
country residence and devote herself to
the bringing up of her children, to
uhom she is greatly attached. But the
Indian Office says she must return to
her poet as Vicereine so that the enter
taining of the native Princes and aris
. y may go on.
It is well known that Lord Curzon
ip a man of ungovernable temper and
frequently when he has come into con
flict with some of the Indian officials
Lady Curzon has been the means of
smoothing matters over. During his
House of Commons days he used to

TRIP OF DUCHESS.
Although the Duchess of Marlbor
has been to Ireland many times,
until she joined Lord Ardilaun's party
when that nobleman entertained the
Prince of Wales at his Connaught seat
a few days ago, t=he had never had an
i unity of exploring the wild and
resque beauty of Connemara. She
made the most of it. She had her own
motor car sent across from London,
and while the men of the party were
engaged in fhooting woodcock she was
_ <-very minute she had at her
disposal in making herself acquainted
with the natural beauties of the local
ity.
Not satisfied with her guide book, she
commandeered the services of an old
resident to show her around. Larry
Mullahy, the man in question, knows
Connemara as po other man knows it.
He has acted as guide to most of the
I personages, including King Ed
ward, who have to- the last fifty years
ventured into Connemara's wilds. But
there is one thing he has never ex
perienced and that is a re in a motor
car. The Duchess invited him to join
her and her maid and chauffeur in the
motor, but Larry stubbornly refused to
risk his precious life by riding in any
conveyance possessing greater speed
than an Irish jaunting car. It was a
question of dispensing with the motor
car or doing without Larry and she
decided in favor of the celebrated
guide.
GITDE GETS FAT FEE.
Larry was employed for three days
and received $15, which was the larg
est sum he had ever earned under
similar circumstances.
"She is a great lady entirely," said
Larry in relating his experiences to
the neighbore. "'She paid me three
times more than King Edward did
when he was Prince of Wales. May
the Lord send that she may be Lady
Lieutenant one day; "It's the great
-g it would be for Ireland."
Kylemore Castle, the Connemara
seat of the Duke and Duchess of Man
chester, was a special object of the
Duchess of Marlborough's curiosity,
c o minutely did she explore the
borhood that a rumor gained
currency in the locality that she had
;e on it for an Irish residence.

ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 26.âAl
though so much has been cabled about
Father George Gapon, the prisst,
whose fame became world wide on
"Bloody Sunday," January 22, ihe
strories sent out about him have been
as contradictory as the imaginary
photographs of him which have been
printed.
Father Gapon is now 34 ye^rs old;
tall and bony, with somewhat ema
ciated features that reveal traces of
lifelong self-sacrifice and suffering.
His hair Is beginning to turn gray.
His complexion is swarthy and his
dark piercing eyes, which glare out on
the world from beneath two black
bushy eyebrows, are filled with fire.
He wears his hair â jet black except
for the threads of gray â in flowing
locks which fall down over his neck;
and his beard, to all appearances, nev
er has been trimmed.
He wears the long, black robe of the
orthodox Greek priest, which reaches
down to the ground and conveys the
impression that he is even taller than
he is. Round his neck is a silver chain,
to which is attached a silver cross, ihe
emblem of his holy calling. Beneath
this priestly robe Father Gapon wears
the rough garb of the Russian peasant,
consisting of coarse woolen vest and
underwear, besides a pair of hu?e jack
boots reaching above the knees and
weighing more than any one outside of
Russia would like to carry around. On
his head Father Gapon wears the tall
round black hat of his priesthood,
which also strengthens the impression
that his stature is extraordinary.
Usually Father Gapon is silent and
reserved, and his impassive features
< onvey the impression of solemn obsti
nacy, but when he is enraged in con
versation on subj^ts which interest
him his face lights up, his impassive
demeanor gives way to excitement,
and he becomes eloquent. Seen at close
ouarters, when the fire burns within
him, it is easy cj understand thÂ» mar
velous power which Father Gapon has
contrived to c.-in over the dull masses
cf the Russian population.
Thus 1t is that at public meetings
Father GaDon can work his audiences
to any pitch of excitement, so that if
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 2C, 1905.
at the conclusion of one of his ora
tions he were to call upon them to
throw themselves against a stone wall
they would as likely as not carry out
the suggestion without question.
George Gapon was born in a remote
village in the Russian province of
Poltava, his father being a liberated
serf. His birthplace was a miserable
little wooden hovel consisting of two
rooms badly lighted, badly ventilated
and unclean. His father earned a
weekly wage of $2 as a farmhand. The
boy was the only child of his parents,
and his â¬ellow-villagers declare that
he gave evidence of unusual intelli
gence at an early age. He attended
the village school and at the age of 12
years he began to work in the fields,
spending half the day at school and
half the day on the farm of his father's
employer. When he was 14 he left
school altogether and became an agri
cultural la*borer at 50 cents a week.
He found that it was possible to rise
in life only by adopting the clerical
profession, and accordingly he turned
his energies in the direction of becom
ing a priest. This is no very difficult
matter in Russia, and with the help of
the parish priest at his own home,
whose confidence he contrived to se
cure, young Gapon was able to enter a
theological college at Kieff at the age
of 21.
It is not much more than a year since
Father Gapon sought an audience of
the late M. Plehwe, the Minister of the
Interior, and submitted to him a de
tailed scheme for organizing an anti-
Socialist league among the St. Peters
burg workmen. Little did M. Plewhe
imagine that the insignificant priest,
to whom he lent his powerful aid,- was
using him as an instrument to pro
mote the cause of revolution.

Special Cable to The Call and New York

LONDON, Feb. 23. â A "dance to a

LONDON. Feb. 26.â Klmbolton Cas
tle, the huge family seat of the Dyke
of Manchester in Huntingdonshire, has
been let to his uncle, Lord Charles
Montagu, who has taken it for a term
of years and, it is reported, intends
spending a fortune in fixing it up. The
Duke's American wife, it is said, flatly
declined to devote any or her cash to
that purpose, declaring that nothing
short of bankruptcy coi:. ever induce
her to make he- home there.
The big house certainly possesses
little architectural beauty, though It is
not lacking in historic associations and
has â or did haye â a ghost. Lord Ron
ald Gower, in his amusing volume of
"Reminiscences," described it as the
ugliest place he had ever seen. The
grounds and gardens have been sadly
neglected of late years and the sur
rounding country is singularly unat
tractive. But money, it expended with
good taste, is a wonderful beautifier.
Trentham Hall, the Staffordshire seat
of the Duke of Sutherland, had origi
nally all the natural disadvantages of
Kimbolton. but the present Duke's
grandmother transformed it into one
of the most exquisite domains in Eng
land.
Lord Charles Montagu, by the way,
is deserving of some attention from
American mammas who seek titled
husbands for their daughter. In the
prime of middle life, he is still a bach
elor, and being fairly well off â he is a
partner in a London stockbroking firm
â would not require a lot of money
with a wife. Socially he is the heavi
est sort of a swell. He is the only sur
viving son of the seventh Duke of
Manchester. The Duchess of Devon
shire. Mary, Duchess of Hamilton, the
Countess of Gosford and Lady Alice
Stanley are numbered among his close
relations.
The Duke and Duchess of Manches
ter still retain a residence in Hunting
donshire â a smaller but much prettier
place than Kimbolton â and with the
lordly domain of Kylemore in Conne
mara, acquired with the Duchess'
money since their marriage, they can
well dispense with the ugly family cas
tle.

LONDON. Feb. 25.â Thougrh economy
â vras never so much needed in Russia,
and the country groans under the bur
den of taxation imposed to maintain
the war, the Czar, it has been learned
h<*re. has taken no steps to reduce his
household exp<-r.fces, v.hieh are thÂ«
most extravagant of any European
court. The money thus squandered
would suffice to keep half a dozen regi
ments on the field. The sums spent
'â¢n feastinfr and drinking: and main
taining a lesion of servants at the pal
ace are colossal. The kitchen is run
on French linea. More than on* 4 Pa
risian "restaurateur" made a fortune
in the Czars employ before he started
in business on his own account at
home. In fact, the heads of the various
departments, with abundant oppor
tunities for perquisites and pickings,
rapidly become rich. A knowlf>.:! j
rookery has in more than on* instance
proved an easy path to greatness.
Nominally the household arrange
ments are in charge of the court mar
shal. Count Benckendorff, but the real
authority is :he court "forager." as
he is termed. He was formerly a chef,
but he has been raised to the rank of a
colonel, sports a gorgeous uniform and

BIG COOKING STAFF.
At the head of the Czar's kitchen
are two French chefs, each of whom
receives a salary equal to that of a
Cabinet Aflnister here, besides per
quisites. Their staff includes four un
derchefs, thirty-eight cooks, twenty
apprentices and thirty-two kitchen
boys.
Fabulous sums are spent on fruits
out of season. Strawberries at =50 cents
each are provided in abundance, and
peaches that cost $12 50 apiece fre
quently appear on the court tables. In
the cellars are 25.000 dozen bottles of
wine of all sorts. Yet, withal. thÂ«
Czar is personally a man of abstem
ious habits and simple tastes in tha
matter of eating and drinking. A ttuji
man, he can devise no method ot
checking the wasteful extravagance
of his court. He Is as much the vic
tim of his environment as th* poorest
peasant in his domains.
PEERAGE DISPUTE SETTLED.
To his many claims to distinction
Cunninghame-Graham, the famous
author, adventurer and socialist, has
added the unique one cf refusing to
become a belted earl unless the dignity
is forced upon him. He has had an
interview with Barclay- Allardice. the
rival claimant to the Scotch earldom of
Menteith, and has struck a bargain
with him which will deprive peerage
lawyers of the rich pickings they had
anticipated from a fight between thÂ»
pair.
Barclay-Allardlce, who to thÂ« mayor
of a little Cornish town, is exceedingly
anxious to become a peer. Otherwise
he is doomed to lifelong obscurity.
Cunnin^hame-Graham does not care a
pin's head for a coronet. He infinitely
prefers ihe excitement of travel and
exploration in the wild regions of thÂ«
earth to the repose of the House of
Lords.
There Is another earldom mhred up
with the dormant Menteith one â that
of Airth. a subsequent creation.
"If you will restrict your claim to thÂ«
Airth earldom," he said to Barclay-
Allardice, "I shall not oppose you. I
don't want a title, but I have enough
pride in my lineage to maintain my
right to be regarded as the male repre
sentative of the line of Menteith."
To this Barclay-Allardlce, who does
not care much what peerage he gets
as long a3 it is a peerage, has agreed.
But it remains to be seen whether the
House of Lords will consent to deal
with the dignities separately.

ECHOES FROM THE LODGE ROOMS
The feature of the country ball that
Â«fcF given in Scandla. Hall by Minerva
Park'! last week was the entrance into
the hall, which had been decorated
with bunches of dried wheat and veg
etable garden products, of the follow
ing members of the genera! commit
tee, who were attired in blue .and
nhite check gingham and sunbonnets
of like material, and represented the
"deestreeck skule": Julia Williams,
teacher; Agnes Tierney, Lena Wilson,
.Sadie Vorath. Ella Sullivan, Jennie
Gorman, Eleanor Anderson, Lena Wall.
Emma Robinette, May Bolham, Mag
gie Wynne, Lizzie Galloway and Mary
Minerva Dempsey. A well arranged
programme of dances kept the com
pany together until a late hour. It
was one of the most pleasant func
tions that this parlor h:-^ ever given.
The fancy dress ball given last week
by Fremont Parlor in the assembly
hall of the Pioneer building was one
that will mark a bright page in the
history of the social functions of this
parlor. It was given under the direc
tion of Mrs. William H. Barry. Maude
Spurr. Ida Courtier, Dora Laven,
Maude McÃaith and Georgians Luce,
The costumes worn by the ladies were
not only attractive, but many of them
were rich and elegant and the wear
ers in taking part in the grand march
presented a scene that was most
pleasing to the eye.
In a circular sent in the latter part
of last January to all the parlors of
the State Grand President Ella E.
Caminetti had the following: "At
the Grand Parlor of 1904 Past Grand
President Ema Gett invited the sub
ordinate parlors to send a tree for
the park at Butter's Fort. Sacramento,
where each tree will be known by the
name of the parlor contributing the
Ram*. Tree* to be sent to Past Grand
President Mr*. Gett, 2330 P street.
Sacramento." In response to this cir
cular, which also asks the parlors to
observe Arbor day by planting at least
one tree and to sow California wild
as well a* to send a tree for
Sutter'6 Fort, a number of the par
lor* have already forwarded a tree to
Sacramento and each of then* has
been plated and properly' labeled.
Keith Parlor recently observed Lin-
c oln day with appropriate exercises.
Minnie Abrams read a well prepared
paper on the life of Abraham Lin
coln:. Maude Langton recited Lincoln's
favorite poem, "Why Should the Spirit
of Mortal Be Proud?" and other
member* assisted to make the occa
sion an interesting one. During the
evening candle* and a light collation
were served. President Meta Kugler
presided. This officer expects to make
her term the most prosperous Keith
Parlor has ever had.
Th lights that glowed from pump
kin Jack-o'-lanterns at the "barn
party" of Company A, La Vespero
drill team, revealed a merry gathering
of maids and men, costumed in tpyl
cal farmer style. The success of this
novel party surpassed even the wild
est dreams of the most energetic
member. Much credit is due to the
committee of arrangements that an
ticipations were realized and this
dance gave more pleasure than any
previous function. The decorations,
suggestive of the interior of a. farm

"In 'The Fortune Teller,' " he added,

"I thought of that â the parody â in

The accompanying picture by Amedee
Joullin hangs on the west wall of his
studio at 207 Sansome street, far
enough away from the salon picture
that won him .academic honors not
to suffer by comparison.
Indeed, not less well drawn is the
smaller canvasâ and drawing is said,
by those who love him, to be Joullin's
artistic sin, and against which, by the
way, I most earnestly protest. What
ever may in earlier years have been
true of Joullin's carelessness as a
draughtsman, there is no record of It
nowâ not a trace.
In color and. in composition this pic
ture is but a trifle less arresting than
his "Death Watch," but infinitely
worthy a deep and abiding study. Be
sides, it tells a story that twenty years
hence will be sought for feverishly by
historians and ethnologists, for Joullin
has, with infinite pains, gone into the
TRUTH of things. The design on the
basket, the weave of the blanket, the
infinite detail of the Indian garb, are
true to tradition, and true to the small
est factor.
For this all lovers of American his
tory should be gratefulâ for the day is
not far in the future when the native
American will be no more.
Then comes the day when we shall
need Joullin's pictures. And may he
give us more of them, more of their
exquisite feeling, of their traditions,
their stoic tragedies. Here is a field
of work that to-day is full of color,
â romance and dramatic intensity; and

"And now the baHet," I prompted,
and through the pansied hosts we
wended our way to the platform from
which the Grigolatis take their flight.
There were seven small painted crosses
on the boards where the ballerinas
must stand, and nothing else in sight.
Four workmen, however, sat there and
regarded me curiously.
"They are part of the corps," the
manager explained. "The apparatus
is watched all the time. Two men
even stay with it all night, and they
are not permitted to drink or do any
thing that would endanger their trust
worthiness."
One saw why very soon. With lead
sinkers about as large as apples, one
wire and then another spun down from
the flies. They may be thicker than
a tack, but slightly, and as I saw the
seven plump German madchens gather
in the wings I gasped: "Is it on those
things that they are suspended?"
"On those alone," the manager re
plied, and I went up to one to examine
it more closely. I took the thin thing
between finger and thumb and in a
second one of the workmen was at my
side. He took the wire as I released it,
carefully wiping off the least trace of

Who of you San Franciscans who
has admired the exquisite miniature
of "Janice Meredith" upon the cover
of Paul Leicester Ford's book of that
name known that it came from the
clever brain and hand of Lillie V.
O'Ryan, the local portrait painter?
And not only is this a fact, but the
portrait of Paul Leicester Ford that
was published from end to end of the
country was likewise from her brush.
And the original can be seen in her
studio, 424 Pine street, where the
beady-eyed little dwarf resting upon
his elbows looks out upon the visitors
with a penetration that stings â and
fascinates.
And thereby hangs a tale too long
to tell to-day;- but suffice it to say that
the intftlnct that prompted Paul Lei
cester Ford's murder by his brother
was the instinct that prompted him to
withhold from Lillie V. O'Ryan. then
a struggling young art student, the
credit that rightfully belonged to her.
But such Js the tribulation of the
artist-folk, whom, somehow, the gods
protect, even though they do permit
them, at times, to suffer.

moisture that might have been left.
"That is for rust," the manager said,
"and the wires are tested every night
to a 2000 pounds' test. The wire is deep
sea sounding wire, by the way."
Laughing and careless the human
pendulums were then hooked on to a
special corset designed for the purpose.
There is only the one wire to each girl
and their sure flight, here and there,
apparently at will, never too far, too
low, too high, is the mystery in charge
of the Grigolatis. There are in the
wing 3on either side four men at work
hauling thick ropes, sailor fashion,
from the flies, that evidently direct the
flight from side to side, but what it is
that keeps the girls from spinning
round on the wires I am not mechanic
enough to know, any more than the
fifty expounders I have heard
tackle the subject. The mystery deep
ens tenfold of course when the premiere
Grigolatl soars over the audience and
poises a second in the air and returns to
the exact spot on the stage that she
left. It is the pendulum principle
again and I give it up. But if for
nothing else one should see "Mother

The importance of a great grand

as the musical standpoint, is evidenced
by the manner in which all San Fran
OXE OF AMKDEK JOUIXIN'S SUPERB INDIAN PICTURES, -THE MEDICLNE MAN."
clsco Is talking about the coming of
the Conried Metropolitan Company to
the Grand Opera-house in April.
Heinrich Conried is so deeply inter
ested in the outcome of the San Fran
cisco season that he has already madÂ©
his plans to come to the city in ad
vance of his organization and to de
vote his personal energies in the direc
tion of the performances. As the in
tendant of the Metropolitan Opera
house and the president of the Metro
politan Opera Company, Mr. Conried
has established one fact absolutely â
he has invariably carried out his
promises to his clientele. Therefore
when Mr. Conried promises a grand
opera season that will surpass all other
opera seasons that have gone before
there is the positive evidence of his
New York achievements to prove that
he will do what he says.
The scenic and mechanical equip
ment which the Conried Company will
bring to San Francisco has never been
approached as to extent and magnifi
cence and the great stage of the Grand
Opera-house will afford every oppor
tunity to Mr. Conried and his asso
ciates to live up to their Metropolitan
Opera-house standard.
The repertoire of the company dur
ing the season of twelve performances,
will include three performances
of the Wagnerian music drama, "Par
sifal," two performances of Pon
chielli's "La Gioconda," two perform
ances of "Cavalleria Rusticana" and
'TPagliacci" and one performance
each of "Rlgoletto," "Lucia," "Die
Meistersinger,' "Der Fledermaus" and

In recent years no name has be
come better known in American music
and artistic circles than that of Henry
W. Savage, the founder of the first
English grand opera company com
posed of all American voices, the
same that is to make its, San Fran
cisco debut at the Columbia Theater
to-morrow night for a three weeks'
season of grand opera in English.
In nine years Mr. Savage has pro
duced eighty-one operas in English,
many of them being especially trans
lated for him and sung by his com-
pany alone. At present he has the
only American productions In English
of the German operas, of Verdi's
"Othello," Puccini's tragic "Tosca,"
and beautiful "La Boheme," and a
number of others. He has given
4500 performances. The company has
had seasons of two years each in Bos*
ton, New York and Chicago.
It will not be possible to Judge his
company by the standards that have
prevailed, for the reason that here*
tofore grand opera has generally been
the exploitation of favorite singers
without regard to artistic excellence.
Mr. Savage's first move was to dis
card the "star" system. His policy
is that of ensemble performances.
Whether the opera be "Othello,"
"Carmen" or "Lohengrin," It is the
opera and not some individual singer
that Mr. Savage "features." Gertrude
Rennyson's Desdemona has been com
pared to that of Emma Eames, her
Elsa to Nordica's, and Joseph Shee
han'3 Orthello to that of Tamagno.
and Winfred Goffs lago to Victor
Maurel's. but it is not on individual
merit that Mr. Savage bases his suc
cess. His entire company that is to
pay its first visit to San Francisco
now numbers upward of 150 people.
For conductors. Chevalier ML B.
Emanuel, who will direct for "Othello,"
has had thirty years in the leading
opera-houses of Europe, and Elliott
Schenck, the Wagnerian conductor to
gether with Walter Damrosch. are the
only Americans wh<% have achieved
fame as grand opera leaders.
The company recently took New Or
leans French opera lovers by storm
and has Just finished its first week
on the coast at Los Angeles, where the
Mason opera-house haa beÂ«n entirely
sold out for all performances.

KINO THWARTS PRINCE
VICTOR IN HIS WOOING
Leopold Fears Consent to Match
With, Daughter Would Anger
France.
PARIS, Feb. 2 5. â There is excellent
authority for quoting a letter received
this week by a friend from Prince
Victor Napoleon. This may not be
the precise phraseology, but the let
ter is in substance as follows:
"Reports that the Princess Clemen
tine and myself are desirous to marry
are true, but her father's refusal is
Hat. I returned yesterday from Vi
enna, whither I went to beg the Em
peror Francis Joseph to intercede on
my behalf. He readily consented. I
can also count on the kindly offices
of the King of Italy in the same re
gard.
"Princess Clementine's father's ob
jection Li based on the ground that his
friendliness with France makes im
possible the alliance of his daughter
with a pretender to the French
throne. However, he knows I have
no such pretensions, and if I had.
such a remote possibility should not
be allowed to Interfere with the hap
piness of two persons. If the throne
were offered me to-day I would turn
it over to my brother Louis, for I
have no desire to carry on my shoul
ders the burden incumbent to such x
task. I have told the King this, but
nothing I can say will change his
fixed idea that my being a pretender
in name makes me ineligible to his
daughter's hand."
Dispatches from Brussels announce
that Princess Clementine, whose
strength of character is remarkable,
has determined to marry Prince Vic
tor with her father's consent, or, if the
Prince consents, without it. Clemen
tine loved her cousin, the late Prince
Baudoin. eldest son of the Count of
Flanders, who was killed In a duel,
to her great grief, which the. Queen
tried to utilise to send Princess Clem
entine to a convent, but the girl's en
ergetic character rebelled.

Charity Dinners the
Proper Caper
longer it It good form in Gothamâ
whence comes all phases of good form
-an Franci6co â to offer a bazaar
for charity. Even is % r audeville passe.
Theatrical etunts? Really. I haven't
heard.
It is now the Charity Dinner.
.. doe? that strike you? â a little
moM? Well, that would ap
* true, but those who move
in the 6ame set take good care of that,
and buy up the table, and invite their
friends. Thus is the inviolability of
their persons unassailed by the
bourgeoisie.
Really it is paid that the charity
dinner has the charity ball beaten a
block â for fun.
As everybody knows, a charity ball
is more or less promiscuous. And
that the real fun only develops at the
latter end of the function, suspiciously
close to the supper hour.
What's that?
"True of most functions?"
Well, the truth to tell, it looks pretty
much that way, with the Friday
Cotillon the lone exception. That's
essentially an early affair, and com
posed largely of the "children."
This innovation. is, however, not to
be despised, eince most of the chaps
who attend work for a living, thereby
escaping the contempt that centralizes
about parasites. And that they may
be clear of brain in the morning de
mands a reasonable amount of sleep.
And for this is Mrs. Inez Shorb
White to be given an extra. It was.
primarily of her planning.
But to hark back to the charity din
ner, why couldn't San Francisco try
it?
Surely there's enough wit and clever
ness among the men and women of
the smart set to keep things going in
their own set.
And as for spectacular effect, what
could be more brilliant than the St.
Francis ballroom agleam with light,
the mirrored walls reflecting a half
thousand splendid women and alert
men dining at bedecked tables, or the
Palace ballroom aglow with ruby light,
as it was at the Greenway Christmas
dance? â¢
At the last brilliant charity dinner
at Sherry's, a dance followed, for those
who hadn't dined too well, nor yet out
grown the simple pleasures of the two
step.
And, by the way, here was where
the debutantes scored â and the laddies.
The elder folk "preferred" to chat.
Remarkable, isn't it. with what
facility some people can substitute
compulsion for choice?
Still, that is a splendid phase of
philosophy, and a condition of mind to
which all men must come, if they
would be happy.
Why can't San Francisco hold a
"Charity Dinner?"
Think of the dazzling possibilities of
gowns and jewels! For opportunity,
it far surpasses the horse show and the
opera.
Besides, it would furnish us chroni
clers of fif smart set doings weeks of
smashing "copy."
Won't >-"me MM propose a Charity
Dinner, even for the noble purpose of
keeping us close up to New York?
Now that "The Liars" is over, things
are undeniably flat.

The Sequoia Club, had a lot of lions
corraled at its gathering cm Tuesday
night at the Palace, and while things
hung rather heavily until after thea- '
ter hour, then things got busy.
The first celebrity to . appear was
Bliss Carmen, he who selfs more verse
than any ether man I know â tall, with
a full shock of brown hair carefully
caressed, beneath which a pair of pen
etrating eyes search for your in
nermost secrets through a pair of
helpful glasses. His manner is cordial,
easy and interested, though tinged
somewhat with a suggestion of mod
esty. 'Strange in a poet? Rather!
But this Bliss Carmen is no make-be
lieve chap. He's honestly clever. Be
sides, he knows a good thing when he
sees itâ he likes San Francisco, and
isn't afraid to say so, even if he is a
Bostonese.
Then there was Lawrence d'Orsay.
Now, there's a charming chap, and no :
mistake. He came in chaperoned by
Frank Powers, who, had a train been
available, would probably have run
him down to Carmel-by-the-Sea; but
there wasn't, so the Sequoia had the
pleasure of meeting him.
With a. most agreeable air the "Earl"
chatted wfch the men and women pre
sented to him, proclaiming himself a -
man of exquisite manner, and quite
the same chap off the boards as on.
And he does like a good cigar! Andâ
for an Englishmanâ a good joke. But
there are those who insinuate that lie

. One of the pleasures of the reception
was the sweet ringing of Miss Salmon,

sympathetic fashion, Mr. Dolmetsch
accompanying her. â¢ ,
Another real pleasure was the
punch, brewed, it is whispered, from a

PROMOTION' COMMITTEE
INVESTIGATES PRI'XFS
With Assistance of University It Sup-
plies Information About Food
Value of the Fruit.
The main nutritive ingredient in
prunes is supar, which Is a most valu
able food when rationally used, says
an open letter just issued by the Cali
fornia Promotion Committee. An
analysis of various samples of prunes
has been prepared for the committee
by the department of chemistry of the
University of California and an ex-
planation of their nutritive qualities
has been given by the agricultural ex
periment station.
The samples were divided into large
and small fruit for the purpose of
ascertaining the difference In composi
tion between prunes of the different
sizes. Of the samples 56.37 per cent
were large prunes, averaging forty
three prunes to the pound, and 43. C5
per cent were small prunes, averaging
fifty-nine prunes to the pound. The
original samples showed fifty-nine
prunes to the pound.
An examination of the data shows
that there is practically no difference
between the nutritive value of the edi
ble portion of the large and small
prunes. The large fruit has the ad
vantage, however, in havingr less re
fuse or pits. Comparing: prunes with
cereals it was found that the digestible
carbo-hydrate contents is almost the
same In each case. In the prunes
pugar predominates. In the grains
stsrch predominates. When properly
used the system will derive as much
benefit from the carbo-hydrates in
fruits as from that in cereals.
Hit by a Swinging Block.
Edwin Jarvis, a ship painter, who
lives at 100 Tucker avenue, while
working on a vessel at the Union Iron
Works yesterday was hit on the side
of the head by a swinging block at
tached to an overhead spar. The blow
cut a deep gash on the side of his
head behind the right ear, rendering
him unconscious. He was treated at
the Potrero Hospital by Dr. Buell and
afterward transferred to the Central
Emergency Hospital, where it may be
come necessary to hold a capital
operation to relieve a depression of
the skull, which is resting on the
brain.

THE AGE OF USEFULNESS.
â¢-pHERE has been much discussion always about the age of use
fulness in man. Youth and age have had their respective claims.
* Out of this old debate issued the maxim, "Old men for counsel,
young men for war." Kinglake in his account of the charge of Bala
klava said "that a desperate cavalry charge should never be led by a
commander over the age of thirty-three.'"
This discussion has recently passed from the literature furnished
by laymen to the findings of science, and Dr. Osier, of Johns Hop
kins, "has uttered the opinion that man reaches his climax at forty
and should be retired or chloroformed at sixty. There is no evidence
that this opinion conforms to the physical or scientific facts. It as
sumes that all men develop equally, and that they are at the same
age equal in respect, to their usefulness in the world. This is no
toriously an incorrect generalization. Some men are mentally fully
developed and aware of their powers at twenty-one. In others ca
pacity is latent to a much later period. We see this in the frequent
instances where the graduate at the head of his class is finally over
taken and passed in the race of life by the man who graduated at
the foot. In his case the capacity was latent. The ability to apply
his learning, to use it as a tool, followed long after the tool was put
in his hand. The head of the class had that ability which grasps edu
cation as an instrument of success, but lacked the form of talent that
could make practical use of it.
All men have known the value of experience as an equipment.
Proverbial lore is full of evidence of this. Now a man of forty, who
began his career at twenty, has twenty years of experience added to
his equipment. It is part of his capital. It strengthens him in all
respects. It gives him an advantage over a man of twenty or thirty.
It has been well said that one generation will not learn from the one
that preceded it. This means that experience is a perstfhal acquisi
tion. It is not acquired by observation of others. A child does not
dread the fire because another has been burned. It goes on playing
with matches until it has burned itself. Then the experience becomes
personal and is remembered and applied.
No one can estimate the loss to the world if men of forty are to
be discredited and disused. It means that human society is to be
permanently deprived of the benefit of twenty years' experience ac
quired by each generation. It is the same as saying that all of the
material accumulations of that twenty years shall be disused and
outlawed. Of the ninety members of the United States Senate eighty
six have passed their .fortieth year and the average age of the Sena
tors is over fifty. According to Dr. Osier it is a mistake to keep such
disused material in the Senate. He speaks of the "crisis of forty
voars." There is no doubt that about that age a physical climacteric
is reached. At forty some succumb. They have for a time a less
resistant force against disease. But when this purely physical crisis
is past, the resistance to disease seems to be as great as at twenty,
and in regard to some diseases it is greater. The critical period in
tuberculosis is between eighteen and twenty-five So there is an
earlier crisis than forty. Persons over forty are more immune from
consumption than those twenty years younger. So one physical crisis
fairly balances the other. Again, the immunity from disease when
the forty year climacteric is past is due largely to the accumulation
of experience. Men know themselves better and abate habits that
tend to shorten life.
If a decree were possible striking out of the world's activities all
men now forty years old, the loss would be so vast as to paralyze
the nations. If there were compulsory retirement or death of' all
now sixty years old. the world would be a desolation scarcely less
marked. In the moral and physical economy there is need of the im
pulse of youth and the wisdom of age. It is' the universal balance in
the economy of lite. Strike out either and society would retrograde.
We regard Dr. Osier's views as distinctly inimical to the wel
fare of society. They induce youth to take a false view of the limit
ot usefulness, and to look lightly upon the value of experience As
men approach forty with their ideals not wholly realized, he teaches
them to despair, and that leads to actual impairment of their forces
But when men are taught that at forty they are equipped with expe
rience as a valuable part of their capital, and that beyond lie the
fields in winch they are to conquer, they go forward, hopeful with
energy under guidance, and the real successes in life may be won Ion"
after that climacteric which he calls a crisis. If his conclusions were
true it would be more than a crisis. It would be a tragedy For the
sake of science it is to be regretted that such views as his are emitted
for they appear to be entirely unwarranted by the facts of phvsiolofrv"
and psychology, and are without foundation in the history of man's
relation to the universe of which he is a part. This being true
science puffers by such statements, and has the right to protest
against Dr. Osier's claim to be its representative protest
THE CHAPARRAL PROBLEM.
AN interesting contribution to the literature of forest conserva
tion especially with reference to conditions in California, is
that from the pen of E. A. Sterling, which appears in the last
Northern th C I^Â° rCSt^ ? uarte . rl y- Under the title "Chaparral in
r.?r Â£? Cahf Â° mia ' the writer sets ' forth facts concerning the
little known menace to forest growth that finds its agent in the
encroaching undergrowth. Under the generic term "chaparral" he
groups all of the bush forms familiar to those who know the moan
taans and are acquainted with the great wastes invaded by them
The _ prevalence of these patches of undergrowth and the rapidity
of their spread among the timbered slopes of the Sierra and coast
mountains induce. a distinct "chaparral problem," says the writer
which must be met if the wooded mountains are to be preserved

AFFECTION AS A SUBSTITUTE
FOR THE SUBLIME PASSION.
DOROTHY FENIMORE
I "WOULD like to say a pood word
for common, every-day, honest af
fection, the kind of love which the
average young man bestows, with
his worldly goods, upon the young
woman whom he marries, the kind of
love which most girls accept later, if
earlier they disdain It.
There are few individuals who are
capable of the sublime passion which
poets so like to write about â because
it gives them such a magnificent
chance to put strange words into
strange places. Love as a rapture, as
an ecstasy, is, like theater suppers, the
privilege of the favored few, not of the
masses. Most people are lucky to have
the wherewithal to pay for seats at
the show.
Girls crave stage romance in love
making for much the same reason that
they buy cream puffs and chocolate
eclairs for luncheo-n when they go
shopping â they are tired of the plain
living at home. Devotion which is
breathed simply in words of one sylla
ble is not different enough from the
vocabulary to which they have always
been accustomed. The homely virtues
which their hard-working, good-na
tured fathers personify look common
place to them because they do not
know enough to understa. d that it
takes a real live hero to stand year
after year with his nose to the grind
stone for the sake of others beloved,
and not complain much about the fric
tion.
A large balance to one's credit of
plain, ordinary affection is just as good
to marry on as a bank account is, if
not better. It will keep the heart sweet
and it will hold a home together.
The average young man who works
too hard to have any superfluous
habits is as desirable a matrimonial
risk as is the average young woman.
The quality of the love which he lays
at her feet is equal to that of the love
which she can give to him in exchange.
Indeed, I think It is a rare woman who
does as well by her husband during the
first few years of their married life as
he does by her. Presently, as the girl
grows wiser, and her home duties in
crease the scale of obligation bal
ances evenly.
When a young man marries he does
not merely give up his bachelor free
dom for the sake of the dear society
of her whom he loves. He works hard
to make a living and to meet an ex
penditure of his money which is quite
beyond his expectations. He puts up
with his wife's inexperience in house
hold matters, and before ami after his
day's work he cheerfully lends a hand,
if he cannot afford to pay a servant.
WHAT IT IS TO LIVE.
TO grapple fate' and fearlessly
Defy its stubborn, stern decree
Until, disarmed, the terror lies
Beneath our feet, recoils and dies;
To look beyond, content to wait
And dignify our low estate
By bending lower, e'er to seek
To help the fallen, lift the weak;
To take no backward stepâ to wit,
Be sure that each ascends a bit,
To love the best, the best to giveâ
This is the meaning solved, to live.

A general impression of the cost and

I tell you truly, you girls who walk
earth absent-mindedly because your
eyes are fixed upon far-away stars,
happiness is not in the skies, It is
growing about your feet. You cannot
miss it if you care to look for It. Its
modest flower is starlike, too, although
It lives so near the ground. And every
day affection dwells in tne heart of it.
Happiness is a humble, a democratic
thing. It belongs to people who work
with the ones whom they love, and who
love themâ to those who work singing.
It is the heritage of generous sim
plicityâof gentle hearts that, praying,
count their blessings gratefully, and
do not ask for more.
The joy that is in the love of which
poets sln^ Is not for every one. For
many of us joy is a holiday beverage â
a champagne that has a headache in
the bottom of the glass. It is a treat
to-day, but you pay high for it to
morrow. But the happiness of sweet
affection was meant for daily use; it is
as good as spring water for the con
stitution.

IMPATIENT iViUSCOVITE.
"Oh, fudge!" exclaimed the Russian
striker in a tone of great annoyance.
"Vas istovitch?" asked his comrade.
"Here it's nearly 3 o'clock in the aft
ernoon and none of the bands of strik
ers has been fired on since early yes
terday. How are we going to keep up
the sort of advertising that will hold
the public interest and sympathy with
such an apathetic campaign as this?"
Whereupon the two speakers started
out waving a red handkerchief and
shouting:
"Death to the bureaucracy, the side
boardocracy, the washstandocracy, the
chiffonierocracy!"
Immediately the coveted daily volley
was forthcoming.
And as the two patriots fell bleed

sleeves smiles of triumph illuminated
their countenances. â Baltimore Amer

"THE BUSHIDO," JAPAN'S
MOST CURIOUS
DOCTRINE.
The Japanese army and navy will
not strike Russia hard if the pres
ent trouble in her territory should de
velop into a revolution, for that would
be against the traditional doctrines of
"the Bushldo." "The Bushido" means
"the moral doctrines of the Samurai,"
and they are obeyed by all the states
men, soldiers and scholars of the pres
ent time with as much holy respect as
the Christian's reverence for the Bible
and its teachings. In Japan Buddhism
is the popular religion, but Buddhist
teachings are not respected by edu
cated men or soldiers. In fact, most
of them are atheists or agnostics, who
do not believe in any religion but the
doctrines of "the Bushido."
"The Bushido," for instance, teaches
a man or woman to have the courage
to perform the hara-kiri if he or she
commits any serious offense. The spir
it of this doctrine is that the of
fender should kill hrmself instead of
waiting to be executed by the law,
which latter is considered in Japan as
one of the most cowardly things. "The
Bushido" also teaches that the life of
a Japanese is a gift of the holy Mi
kado, and if the country need the lives
of her people they should be given
gladly, for that is only to return to
the Mikado what they have received
from him.
To die on the battle-field is the only
key for a, Japanese to find his way to
his Shinto heaven, and the -soldiers
who were not killed on the battle-field
are considered unfortunate. It is main
tained in Japan that if a man gives
you a favor or money or pleasure, you
should return It with more than what
was given to you. â Hydesaburo Ohashl
in Leslie's Weekly.
SUNFLOWER PHILOSOPHY.
Another trouble with a cold day;
people won't talk about anything else.
We have noticed that all of this talk
of the crime of race suicide is by the
men.
Family rows begin when the children
are little, and the mother is the Judge
and jury.
A girl's steady is not the real thing
unless he meets her at the train when
she returns home from a visit.
No one in the world looks quite so
lonesome as the man who is sitting
alone in his home with his women
folks gone.
A secret isn't really important when
told by a woman unless she stuffs the
keyhole and looks under the bed before
telling it.
There is a great deal said of the "im
penetrable smile," considering that
there is no such thing, a smile tells
what it means plainer than a primer. â

GREDIT DUE DR. ORELLA.
Editor The Callâ As one of the se
verely injured in the wreck of the
Sunset Limited Tuesday morning, Feb
ruary 21, I was slightly surprised to
find the amount of medical aid extend
ed to the late deceased William Low
rie by professionals coming on the
succor train.
Now, in fact, all the aid given to the
unfortunate deceased was extended by
Dr. F. R. Orella of this city, who hap
pened to be a passenger on the
wrecked train, and fortunately. hav
ing his surgical instruments and med
icines in tabloid form (including
opium), was enabled to alleviate the
unfortunate victim's sufferings, so as to
reduce his agony to a bearable state.
After Dr. F. R. Orella had attended to
the case of Mr. Lowrie he took me in
hand after I had been unconscious,
and while dressing my wound, casually
remarked: 'Poor Lowrie has not more
than two or three hours to live." The
doctor's diagnosis was correct; death
occurred three hours after the acci
dent and before any other medical aid
arrived. And I believe that Dr. Orella
did not. in most cases, even receive
verbal thanks from his patients.
I think, it hardly fair ,4o ignore him
entirely in a case where 'his profession
al services were given so cheerfully,
promptly and efficiently. I never
heard of or met the doctor until after
the accident, but do like the old-fash
ioned^ "fair play" and "honor where
honor is really due," as it undoubtedly
is to worthy Dr. Orella.

THE SAVING
REVELATION
VIRGINIA LEILA WENTZ
THE day had been hard, bright
and cold. Out In Central Park
there was the jangle of sleigh
bells In the airâ people, for the
most part, making for home;
because the strong wind which had
suddenly swept up the city streets was
now droving a dizzy herd of snow
flakes before it.
Women, sitting in their sleighs, un
der the full stare of the setting sun,
did not feel their rugs and furs one
whit too heavy. Down in the city's

ments, the poor drew their shawls and
coat collars higher round gray, pinched
faces.
Helena Christy hafl tÂ© hold her
toque on with both hands; her cheeks
and lips were as red as June roses;
some chiffon ribbons blew out from
under her furs, and flapped across her
companion's face. They had the faint
scent of some flower or other. What
ever it was, it was the scent he loved
best in the world.
But if either the woman or the -per
fume awakened any sentiment in him
the expression of the Hon. Kelsie Sid
dons did not show it. His handsome,
manly face wore the aspect of stern
restraint, habitual to him.
As he leaned against the sleigh
cushions, he beheld the diminishing
perspective of electric light pricking
Itself cut down the snowy drive,
caught sight of the blue-mounted po
lice on their mettlesome steeds, and
recognized familiar faces in the long
procession of sleighs and carriages
rolling northward, ho was conscious
of only one thins â he had set out on
this drive with the fixed purpose of
asking the woman beside him to be
come his wife. And her home lay just
at the lower end of the park.
He was a man who never went back
on his fixed purposes.
As they were turning out of the park
on Fifty-ninth street, Helena was say
ing:
"The woman who is worth while
never undervalues the offer of marriage
from any man. Be he much or little,
it is the greatest compliment he can
pay her. Coming from you. my friend,
such a compliment Is the more to be
valued. But I cannot marry you."
The man did not answer at once.
Neither did the expression of his face
seem to change. He tucked the lap
robe -around her a little more securely.
"Do you know," he remarked, when
he had finished with the fur robe, "I'd
like to trespass a little further som*
time, and ask permission to discuss
the matter with you?" They were pull
ing up in front of the big white stone
apartment house where she lived.
"As I said," came back Helena's
voice, lightly, as she undid his work
of robe-taking, "in asking me to mar
ry you, you paid me a great compli
ment. In exchange. I daresay. I owe
you permission to indulge your hobby
for argument and discussion. Come
in, now, won't you, and have some tea
with me? I warn you. no amount of
argument can profit either of us; but
still come."
Within, behind heavily curtained
windowsâ in sharp contrast to the bit
ing cold withoutâ was sweet warmth,
soft rugs, draped screens, shaded
lamps, all the dainty plenishings of a
modern boudoir. In the fast-growing
dusk the firelight flashed on the little
silver kettle beginning to steam at the
spout; on the Dresden and old Wor
cester ware on the ebony tea-table; on
the woman who had drawn a low,
cushioned chair close beside it.

"The situation is like this." tae man
was saying, in rather much thÂ« same
tone of voice he would have used in
arguing an important case before the
I Supreme Court, "you are 30 â or is it
j 31? You have a reputation as a bril
liant, beautiful woman, and all that.
| You can, I am aware, marry any one
lof three or four men who can offer
quite as much as I, but modesty was
never a characteristic of mine. And I
can give you almost anything you wish
that costs money. I stand well in my
j profession; close to the top of It, .n
! fact. I am not yet 40. On the whole.
I a marriage between us might be what
is termed a very suitable match."
The woman smiled openly. "Does
the prosecution here close its de
fense?" â her father, also, had been a
Judge. "Sugar and cream? Yes?
Well, here:" She deftly poured out
the fragrant drink.
As the man reached for his cup he
looked at her a trifle perplexed.
"Are you offended?" he asked. "I've
made an offer of marriage in a per
fectly buslnesa-like way, having heard
you often declare that a marriage con
tract is like any other contract, and
should be entered into only when both
parties are aware of what they are
doing, and are rid of glamour."
His companion paid him the tribute
of a lingering glance in which a ques
tion mark was barely perceptible. But
in the shadows he could no longer
see her face â only the white parting
of her burnished hair where the fire
light shone. In a second she was sip
ping her tea, nonchalantly enough, and
had recovered her vein of light rail
lery:
"Offended ? Oh, certainly not. But
the defense will submit an argument.
The match would be. as you say, a
suitable one â what do our French
cousins call It? â marriage de conve
nance. As for the three or four men
to whom you refer, I cannot answer.
I've noticed, however, that the num
ber of my proposals is falling off late
ly. I attribute the fact to advancing
age. You were not wrong when you
said I was 31. The defense will close
the argument by saying that she has
determined to become an old maid:"
The Hon. Kelsie Siddons was lean
ing forward, his strong, muscular
hands clasped loosely before him, i
whimsical smile on his lips.
"Oh, you will never die an old mail.
I will answer for that!" The smile
vanished. He resumed his stolid man
ner. "But your refusal of me Is final.
I take it?"
"Do I seem to be melting?" Helena
inquired, with a touch of defiance
which comported ill with the tumul
tuous beating of her heart, and a most
annoying feeling of tremulousness
about her lips.
The man rose and went to the win
dow. Far off, across the park, arose
the big hotels on the plaaa. their
lofty outlines seen obscurely fhrough
the snowdrift. The lights of swiftly
moving sleighs and carriages down
below glimmered faintly, and above
all and through all trembled the un
earthly voice that is never silent,
though it may speak in various moods,
the voice that molds into itself the cry
of human Joy, the wail of human sor
row, the roar and crush and rush of
the million mindless things that man
has made to serve his ends â the voice
of the great city.
"I think," he said a* last. anH his
voice seemed to Helena to sound far
away, "that I forgot to mention one
thing in my proposal. I should have
told you, perhaps, that I love you,
that I've loved you since the day when
we first met, that I'd rather have your
love than the power of a Klnjr or the
wealth of a Croesus, that I should
count it fine and wonderful beyond all
imagining â a moment to die for â if I
read in your eyes that you. too, loved
me. Not \#shing to be a beggar of
love, I've waited all these years to
be in a position to offer you thÂ»
things which I was bold â¢noug'h to
mention as rendering me eligible for
your hand."
His voice had become prorokingrly
low and husky. Now he turned to
her almost fiercely.
"You who are so collected and calm,
what can you know of love and pas
sion? Now I realise that Tve tolled
all these years in vain â no! not wholly
rainly â for I'm p;oln#; to kiss you
onee â here, now â if it means the
worst!"
He caujnt her to him and rained
kisses upon her â her lips, her eyes,
her brow. When he released her it
was with the full consciousness that
he had committed an- unforgivable
wrong. He stepped backward until
there lay between them a broad strip
of the fire-lit rug.
But the woman held out her arms
to him and the lashes of her eyes
were wet.
"Sweetheart," she whispered, as she
crossed her slim hands behind his
dark head and drew it down to her
level, 'why didn't you tell me that
you loved me at first? That was the
saving revelation:" â (Copyright, 1905,

Plan Is to Study American
3lethods and Put Them

. n,Â«^;rh la ThÂ« C*JL
LONT>ON, Feb. 25â Under the name
of "the Agricultural and Industrial So
ciety." an orsrani^atton has just been
formed :n London which is going to
mskf a determined effort to break
down what it terms the monopoly of
th*Â» American meat importers in the
English market. As to just how the
thinp is to be done there Is much
reticer.ee among the promoters, but
their first step will be to study the
methods of their successful rivals.
For this purpose Maurice Perry, a
wealthy agriculturist, and Alfred
Eymons, a prominent wholesale
butcher, who have been most active in
the organization of the new assoc'a
tion, will start for America before the
end of this month. They will be ac
companied by a third delegate, a man
of general business knowledge, ap
pointed by one of the English co-opera
tive societies. So assured are they that
In any event they will be able to turn
to good account the information they
will pick up on the other side that
these delegates have undertaken to
pay their own expenses.
TROVBLF OVEB RATFS.
It is declared that the exorbitant
freight rates charged English prodoc
ers by English railways constitute at
present the chief obstacle to the suc
cess of the scheme. English mads
charge nearly h much for transport-
Ing g-oods from points in Essex to Lon
don, a digtan' â¢ I f miles, a? do
American railway? for shipments from
â¢ â¢ York.
The delegates to the United States
will, therefore, first devote themselves
to a study of American transportation
methods. They will then visit the lead
ing meat depots in the United States
and investigate the system of packing
fcrr inland distribution and export em
ployed in each place. By this means
they expect to learn how big things
can be done most economically. When
they return after having mastered
th^ir American lessons, the society
v ill begin operations with a capital of
t:. n .OGO. already subscribed.
It will start by importing cattle
from Ireland. The cattle will be stall
fed and then slaughtered, the cut up
carcasses being delivered in such por
tions as required direct to London
residents. . l! .the railroad companies
t-annot be induced to grant lower
rates motor cars will be employed.
The promoters estimate that by this
method English fed beef can be de
livered at consumers' houses for
something like 5 cents a pound less
than is ordinarily charged in the
fhops for American meat-
THIST OF THEIR OWN.
If they meet with success they will
extend their operations to embrace
produce of various sorts and expect
on to enter into competition with
the American flour mills. Their farm
work will be restricted at first to Es
fpx. a fertile region most favorably
situated for supplying the London
market, but under the stress of for
ompetition agriculture has woe
declined there, as in other
perts of England. A large acre-
Lge has passed out of cultivation and
many who were at one time prosper
ous fanners there, have emigrated to
the United States or the colonies.
American meat importers now prac
tically dominate the great Smithfield
market and as part of their, campaign
against them the new association will
endeavor to Induce the corporation of
the City of London to place some re
strictions on the privileges they now
enjoy there which will afford the deal
ers in English meat a better show. It
is hardly likely that they will accom
plish â¢ much In that direction, how
ever.

Immense profits were made by the

the pensions became payable these
diminished, and Labouchere assailed
the scheme as fraudulent.
It would now take 590,000,000 to

Siijrg-osts Pure-hasp bt Tract
<>t Land for Pupils of
New Parental Institution
At yesterday's meeting of the Board
of Education Superintendent of Schools
I.anpdon presented â  lengthy report in
w-hich he makes a number of sugges
tions for the improvement of the pub
lic school department which met with
the hearty approval of the board.
Langdon recommends that the Su
pervisors be asked to appropriate $5000
for the establishment of two kinder
gartens in the populous parts of the
city. Upon this point he says:
' The establishment of kindergartens
in the public schools would provide for
children between the ages of five and
six and keep them out of the first
grade. It would take some of this age
from the free kindergartens and make
r<M-im for younger members of the fam
ily between the ages of three and five.
An appropriation of $12,000 for the
purchase of books for indigent pupils
is reromrnended, as many changes will
be made in the text books by the State
Text Book Commission. Regarding
the success attaching to the four un
graded rooms established in the past
year Langdon says:
WANTS (XGRADF.D CLASSES.
"The greatest need for the ungraded
room has been found in the grammar
grades, for here the accumulated de
fects of previous grades is most ap
parent. At least half a dozen ungrad
ed rooms for grammar grades should be
added. For this an additional sum of
$5000 'is needed."
Much of the report is devoted to the
successful establishment of the paren
tal school:
"This school has now been in suc
cessful operation for seven months.
It has fulfilled our greatest expecta
tions as shown by the Superintendent's
report submitted December 22. 1904, on
the parental school. The benefit to
those actually attending this school
has been but a small part of the re
turns to the city; the fact that such a
school exists and that children may at
any time be sent to it has a restraining
and subduing influence perceptibly
felt in almost every school of our city.

MAYOR ISSUES
AN ULTIMATUM
Threatens to Suspend Audi
tor Buohr if Grand Jury
Expenses Are Not Repaid
TO REIMBURSE CITY
Cannot Expect to Be Sus
tained in Proposed Action
by Board of Supervisors
Mayor Schmltz yesterday pent a
communication to Auditor Baehr call
ing on him to make good the moneys
paid out on audited demands for Grand
Jury expenses which are regarded as
illegal by the city's chief executive,
Schmitz gives Baehr one week to make
a settlement with the city and in the
event of his failure to do so threatens
to suspend him from office. Schmitz
adds that he knows that his action In
that respect will not be sustained by
the Board of Supervisors. The sus
pension would be nul and void with
out the concurrence of the Supervis
ors under the provisions of the charter.
The Mayor's letter In part reads:
â¢'I will not permit, if In my power
to prevent, such cold-blooded disregard
of the laws governing the custody and
disbursement of the city's funds, and
I hereby 'notify you, for the last time,
to make good to the treasury of the
city and county the moneys illegally
disbursed on these so-called Grand
Jury demands by reason of your ap
proval thereof.
"If this shall not have been done
within one week from this date, I shall
suspend you from office under the pro
visions of sections 18 an' 19 of article
XVI of the charter, and, as therein
provided, shall report such action to
the Board of Supervisors, knowing,
however, in advance, that by reason of
your existing political combination
with the majority of said board they
will not sustain me in my endeavor to
enforce the law against you, but feel
ing that at least all I can do in the
line of my own duty will have been
dane and that any resulting blame will
thereupon rest where it may properly
belong."

Leaves of absence were granted to
Miss Anna C. Brittan, Miss May Ar

TURNS FORGER
AND BURGLAR
John P. Brennan, Clerk for
Wetmore Brothers, Starts
Out on Criminal Career
PILFERS FROM OFFICE
Passes Checks Purporting
to' Bear Firm's Signature
on Several Business Men
John P. Brennan is in prison. Three
charges of forgery and one of bur
glary will be booked against him. He
was arrested yesterday by Detective
Harper and Policeman Keyaa,
Brennan was employed as a clerk
in the office of Wetmore Bros., Lom
bard and Montgomery streets. The
police were notified that on the nlgrht
of October 16 the office had been en
tered by a burglar and a typewriter,
overcoat and punching machine for
checks stolen. Harper and Keyes were
detailed on the case and arrested
Brennan in a second-hand store, where
he was tryingf to dispose of the type
writer and overcoat.
Complaints had been made to the
police that checks bearing the forged
signature of Wetmore Bros, had been
circulated. Two of the victims, Henry
Helberg, ffrocer, 450 Ninth street, and
Otto Schinkel, grocer, 488 Eighth
street, had a look at Brennan yester
day morning and recognized him as
the man who passed the checks on
them. They swore to complaints be
fore Police Judge Conlan, charging
Brennan with forgery. Helberg Is out
$20 40 and Schinkel $10 50. Another
victim is W. J. McCreery, proprietor of
the Adams House. 639 Clay street, who
is out $18 60. He identified Brennan
and will swear to a complaint charg
ing him with forgery to-morrow morn
ing.
The checks were all drawn on the
Swiss-American Bank and Brennan
used the stolen punching machine to
punch the amount on each check.
The police believe that other victims
will be heard from. Brennan is a
young man, dresses well and appears
to be well educated. The police are
looking up his record.
Smuggles Opium Into Jail.
W. l^gan paid a visit yesterday to
his friend, Herman Leland. who is

CONFER ABOUT
PORTLAND SHOW
Topic of County Exhibits
Is Discussed by Valley
People and Commissioner
SPACE IS OKE FACTOR
Concentration by Sections
Is Officially Advocated
to Meet the Emergency
Delegations from the Sacramento and
San Joaquin valleys conferred yester
day at the Palace Hotel with J. A.
Filcher, Deputy Commissioner for Cal
ifornia to the Lewis and Clark Expo
sition, In reference to the installation
of exhibits at Portland. The exposi
tion will open June 1 and will last five
months. The contract for the Califor
nia State building has been let, with
a penalty provided for failure to com
plete it by May 1. On February 14
Messrs. Filcher and Wiggins, who were
Commissioners to the St. Louis Expo
sition, were appointed Deputy Com
missioners for the coming show at
Portland, and they are now serving
as such. With these facts In mind the
representatives of the great interior
valleys of California were of the opin
ion that it was time to reach a general
understanding.
The principal topic considered was
the question of county displays at Port
land. Commissioner Filcher explained
the situation, and a general discussion
followed. Filcher said that, in his
opinion, county displays would not be
feasible, owing to the relatively small
space that California will have for ex
hibition purposes at Portland. At St.
Louis this State had 60,355 square feet
of exhibition room, but at Portland the
limit is 20,000 square feet â less than
one-third of the St. Louis allowance.
In the 2<\ooo square feet must go all
the State features that no county would
provide, like the forestry, wine, olive
oil, mineral and educational exhibits.
"For this reason," said Filcher. "it
will be necessary to cut the cloth to
fit the coat. My idea is that we should
have five or six sided installations of
any particular line "of exhibits. Each
of the sides could be assigned to a
section, and sectional displays might
be made in this way, and, at the same
time, have them collectively represent
tative of the State. County exhibits
are not practicable, while sectional
ones are, on the plan that I have in
dicated. It will be necessary for each
section to provide enough to install
ar.d maintain an exhibit throughout
the season. It is also desirable that
literature, wall maps, table albums il
lustrative of scenery and resources and
the like should be provided by sections.
"The State will provide for lectures
and lantern slides. The various parts

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain ami Provisions.
CHICAGO. Feb. 2.>.âWeakness in the wheat
market was In evidence from the start. Im
proved weather conditions In the Northwest
had resulted in an. Increased movement from
the farms. '. This fact Induced considerable
selling by commission houses and pit traders.
Initial quotations on May were *14 -. to %c at
$1 18%&1 IS%. July was a shade to %@Vic
lower at Jl 01% to 1 01%. For a time the
market received some support from the
strength in corn. When, however, the price
of the yellow cereal began to decline under
the extent of realising sales the wheat mar
ket followed downward. After touching $1 ls%
91 18% for May and $1 02 for July, prices
eased off gradually. There- was little. snap
to the market. Trading was small In vol
ume. Prospects of a liberal . Increase In
world's shipments and the amount on passage
helped to create a bearish sentiment. ' For
May the lowest point of the session was
reached at $1 18. July sold off to $1 01%@
1 01% and the market closed weak with May
at $1 18%. Final quotations on July were at
$1 ol%@l 01%. . :â  .
Profit-taking on a liberal scale was re
sponsible for a moderate setback In the price
of corn. May opened unchanged to â %c high
er at 47% to 48c, and closed at 47%@47%c. .
Weakness of corn and heavy selling by
cash houses, Indicating larger arrivals, caused
an t-aslcr feeling In the oats market. May
closed at 31@3] %.
Selling of pork by commission houses was
the feature of the trading in provisions. * May
pork closed with a loss of 2%c; lard was up
5Â©7% c, and ribs were up 2%c- : .v â .â

Potatoes. Onions and Vegetables.
Trade In Potatoes was quiet, a 9 usual on
Saturday, but there was no change In prices
or market conditions. Firm prices ruled for
all seed kinds and the limited supplies of
prime table Burbanka were firmly held at the
outside quotations. There has been some Im
provement In the demand for cheap river stock,
several large orders from northern points hav
ing been placed during the past few days, but
the daily receipts continued heavy and stocks
on hand are still excessive. Sweets are ar
riving at the rate of a carload a day and are
meeting with a good demand at steady prices.
There have beon no Onions received for two
das's and tho market rules firm at the recently
advanced quotations. Two earloada fall due
from the north to-mcrrow and dealers are ex
pecting a 3c market
Early arrivals of southern vegetables con
sisted chiefly of Peas and String Beans, most
of which were of poor quality and prices
ranged lower. The late express brought come
moderate consignments of other descriptions,
which were not delivered at the stores in
time to be sold. Over 100 boxes of Asparagus
came in. but prices ruled steady, fancy selling
at 20c and the lower grades at 10@15c per

SAN FRkCiSCO, CALIF.BRINKBURN IS DETAINED
FOR A SMALL DRUG BILL
United States Marsha! Holds the Vessel in the Harbor Until
Captain Peters Pays Obligation.
British Steamer to
Take Cargo to
Yokohama.
immp steamer Brink
burn rÂ« Â« eived her orders yesterday
from London and late in the after-
r Yokohama with the
bad loaded for Vladivostok.
. .11 would have sailed
â¢.ho afternoon had not Cap
ovÂ«m looked tb* set-
f a bill ior $7 worth
of drufrs. There m yome dis
â¢nui the amount and
m â  id he \vuuid rK? worse
than seized by the Japanese if he paid
â¢ it. When the druggist learned yester
day that the Biinkburn had cleared
Dd in about an hour a
deputy United States marshal was in
possession of the big tramp, which
the medicine man had libeled for the
Jill bill. Captain Peters said many
thing-s about druggists. United States
Marshals and other American insti
tutions. The deputy marshal said
nothing. Money was the only conver
sation he cared to hear from Captain
Peters and for his part the silent elo
quence of the libel was all sufficient.
Captain Peters, realizing at last that
he could not reconstruct the Federal
law, to which the drug man had con
fided his case, decided to pay. The
drug bill was still $7, but it cost "near
ly $40 to lift the libeL
The Brinkburn left here some time
ago with a cargo of contraband for
Vladivostok. From here she went to
Comox for coal. While there the ca
ble told how the Japanese were giving
a continuous performance of seizing
blockade runners outside Vladivostok.
The Brir.kbum's owners ordered the
vessel here for orders. The orders
came yesterday.
The Brinkburn has probably the
most expensive crew shipped at this
port in many days. Officers and men
signed articles when the vessel's des
tination was Vladivostok and except
for five sailors who deserted at Co
mox the original crew is still on board,
serving under the original articles.
They could not be driven out or the
Brinkburn now. They are receiving
coast wages, which are considerably
higher than those paid for deep sea
voyages, nd in addition each man is
â¢ entitled to transportation by liner
. back to San Francisco.
Coptic Sails for Orient.
The Occidental and Oriental Steam
'"ompany'g liner Coptic, Captain
am Finch, sailed at 1 o'clock yeÂ«
ifteraooa tor the Far East. In
â¢n to about forty cabin passen
hf roptio carried a large number
a, both Chinese and Japanese.
She carried a full cargo, most of it, as
has been the case with all Oriental
Miners for come time, for Japan.
Amnnp the Coptic's passengers for
Yokohama wap Lieutenant Kozo-To
a Japanese warrior, who has
been in this country on official busi-
M. Shiraishi of the Toyo Kisen
q., another passenger, has been
<irr!ing the globe with funeral Agent
Avery in search of new fields for the
-ion of the company's activity.
When the T. K. K. resumes its trans
pacific business it is probable that in
addition to contributing a service, as
between here and the Orient, its
MfV wM make regular calls at
(Vntral and South American ports.
While in Scotland Avery and Shir
aishi bought materials for the con
struction of two big fast passenger
liners, to replace the America. Nippon
and Hongkong Maru. which were im
pressed into the Government service.
The materials bought on the Clyde
have been shipped to Japan, where the
new steamers will be built.
The withdrawal of the Gaelic from
the O. and O. service has resulted in
a number of changes in the personnel
of the Coptic's crew. Captain William
Finch, who commanded the Gaelic, is
now the Coptic's commander. Dr.
Frank H. Gates, who was on the Gae
lic, is now surgeon on the Coptic. R.
Lobeny, who for many years was first
officer of the Coptic and who com
manded the liner on the voyage home
after the death of Captain Armstrong,
is now chief officer. John Richardson,
chief engineer, was for a long time on
the Gaelic and he, Dr. Gates and Cap
tain Finch are old shipmates. W. A.
Chapman, the purser, succeeded A. E.
Rennie, who is now on the Mongolia.
The Gaelic's former stewardess. Miss
Elliott, is now on the Coptic, having
<-*ded Mrs. Edith Mitchell.
Mitchell, who was stewardess
of the Coptic for many years, sailed on
ihe liner yesterday as a passenger. No
body had more friends to see them off
or a bigger armful of California bios- j
Home. Mre. Mitchell was known to
regrular passenger and was one
f the inPtitutions of trans-Pacific trav
el. She is going into business at '

There â was much green grass on her
bottom and many barnacle?. A visit
to the dry do<-k was a necessity or the
liner's pace would be so deliberate that
before she got back from the isthmus
she would have knocked the schedule
ail out of tune. She will not sail, there
fore, until Wednesday at noon.
Taeoma Not at Moji.
The steamship Taeoma, which was
reported some time ago ,at Moji, is
again on the overdue list. She left
Seattle fifty-one days ago for Vladi
vostok. The report of her arrival at
Moji seems to have been" an error n:id
the missing blockade runner is quoted
for . reinsurance at 30 per cent. The
other overdue* are: The Stork, 80 per
cent; Francois and Brodick Bay, 5 per
cent; Skidby, 75 per cent, and Black
braes, 16 per cent.
Weather Bureau Kvf.lains.
ThÂ«Â» following letter haÂ«- been re
ceived from Professor Alexander G.
McAdie, in charge of the United States
Weather Bureau at this port:
"United States Department of Agri
culture, Weather Bureau,
"SAX FRANCISCO, Feb. 24.
"Editor Call â Dear Sir: Referring to
the inclosed clipping from The Call
of February 20 it is but an act of jus
tice to the Weather Bureau observer
at Point Reyes to Fay that he reported
thp steamer "Arctic" and not "Aztec."
The message is received, however,
over a telephone wire which runs
parallel to power lines and at times
there is difficulty in distinguishing the
words clearly. Both of the exchanges
were informed that we were uncertain
whether it was the Arctic or Aztec;
but the misunderstanding was made in
San Francisco and not at Point Reyes.
The article in question suppresses all
mention of the "Arctic" and works an
injustice to one of the most accurate
marine observers I have ever known.
Very respectfully,
"ALEXANDER G. McADIB.
"Professor."

INJURIES MAY
PROVE FATAL
Frank Raymond, Deputy
Sheriff of Alameda County,
Is in a Critical* Condition
BAD FRACTURE OF SKULL
Augustino Romani, Who
Was Cause of the Accident,
Detained Pending Result
Frank Raymond is in a critical con-
dltion at the Central Emergency Hos
pital and it is not expected that he will
recover. The operation of trephining
the skull was performed on him yes
terday morning in the hope of saving
his life.
Raymond is a Deputy Sheriff of
Alameda County and an ex-member of
the local police force. He joined the
force in 1880 and was dismissed in
1885 for being off his beat. While
kaymund was taking Frank Herman,
alius Frank Wilson, a bicycle thief, to
Fclsoni penitentiary to serve a six
years' term about three weeks ago the
prisoner escaped from him at Sacra
mento.
On Friday night Raymond went up
to Augustino Romani, who was talk
ing to a friend on Montgomery street,
near Clay, and asked Romani for a
cigar and a matih. Raymond was un
der the influence of liquor. Romani
gave him a cigar and match and Ray
mond began to go through Romani's
pockets. Romani pushed him away
from him and he fell, striking on trie
back of his head and fracturing his
skull. Romani was arrested and
locked up pending the result of Ray
mond's injuries.
The police were notified yesterday
afternoon that Raymond was likely to
die and Assistant Bond and Warrant
Clerk Louis Ward was sent to the hos
pital to take his ante-mortem state
ment. Detectives ODea and Coleman
took Romani from the prison to the
hospital so that Raymond could iden
tify him. It was discovered that Ro
mani could only talk Italian and one
of the officers went in search of an
interpreter. Raymond was in a semi
censcious state and while waiting for
the interpreter h>- lapsed into uncon
sciousness.
HELEGATES TO MEETING

As the closing event of the Pacific
Coast Jobbers' Association, which has
been in session for several days, John
J. Wirtner, who represents several of
the manufacturers of harness acces
sories in the East, gave a compli
mentary dinner to his many friends in
the trade last Wednesday evening at
his home 2330 Vallejo street.
Covers were laid on a large circular |
table for twenty-one. The decorations
were in red. At the appointed time
the guests were escorted to the din
ing-room,, their entrance being the
signal for the rendition of "A Hot
Time in the Old Town To-night" by a
string orchestra in an adjoining room, .
The guests found their seats by cards
with their names written upon them
attached to the menu. The menu
created considerable amusement, aa
each one present was made the object â¢
of good-natured reference thereon.

ARTHUR K. BLAIR'S WIDOW
SUES FOR SHARE OF IXCOME
Entitled to Fourth Interest In Prop
erty Left in Trust by I^ady
Yarde-Buller.
A suit for partition of the income of
the property at the corner of Pine and
Battery streets, left by Lady Tarde-
Puller in trust for her sons, Ralph K.
and Arthur K. Blair, was begirh yes
terday against Trustee W. H. Chap
man by Edan Ursula Blair, widow of
Arthur Blair. Her attorneys :>re P. F.
Dunne and C W. Durbrow.
Lady Tarde-Buller created the trust
in 1900, providing that the income of
her San Prancisoo and Oakland prop
erties should be given to her sons. In
March, 1903, the brothers signed an
agreement to divide trie trust property
after her death and in the event of the
death' of Arthur, a fourth interest in
the property was to go to hi 3 widow.
He died a month after the agreement
was signed and Mrs.- Blair says that
her demands for' her 'share of the in
come have been refused. Lady Yarde-
Buller died last November.

terday afternoon. The argument was
not concluded and will be resumed to
morrow morning. Smith shot and
killed Joseph E. McOowan In a brick
yard at 2Â§96 Mission street on the
morning of November 26.

fl Cure the Cases That Others
Cannot Cure.
A BOLD STATEMENT. BUT JUST
as true as It Is bold. - Not all cases
\ that others fall to cure are curable by
my method, but â  fully ninety per cent
of them are. The way to learn whether
. your case is curable or not Is to con-
sult me. â ! know exactly what can be
done -in every instance. . I ought 'to
know this, s for I - have 'done nothing
, other than treat men's disease* for
seventeen years. If your case is cur-
. able I will treat you. If it isn't I
.will not. .; If I treat you, and If you
50 desire, " â¢ â  â¢ â¢. . .
I Will Wait for My Fee Until
You Are Well.
VARICOCELE
\ Varicocele is a relaxation, knotting
and twisting of th* < most vital blood
..vessels of the organic system. It stag-
..- nates the local circulation and inter-
feres with the processes of waste and
repair. Neglect brings derangement of
functions and Injury to the general
health. Most physicians resort to sur- .
gical .- operations and hospital treat-
ment. I cure Varicocele in one week
without operation. â -. pain â¢ or detention
from business. My cures are absolutely
permanent, and no ill effects whatever
can follow my treatment.
WEAKNESS
Functional weakness In men is in
reality a comparatively simple ailment,
jf and Is but a symptom of local disor-
der, a state of chronic inflammation of
the prostate gland. No stimulating
- treatment, whether internally or locally ,
, applied, can do more than excite tem-
porary activity. By my system of local
treatment I restore absolutely normal
- conditions throughout the organs In-
volved, which promptly results in com-
plete and permanent restoration of
strength â¢and vigor. This treatment â Is
- original with me, and is the only radi-
cal and certain cure yet devised.
Contracted Disorders
' ' â¢ I have reduced the time required for
. curing- ; contracted disorders about one-
half. This is an important achieve-
ment. It replaces danger with safety.
It forestalls chronic complication*. "It
1 removes the Infection and inflammation
, before that vital center, the prostate
gland, can become involved. To many
men it means the difference between
perfect health and a lifetime of misery
and functional weakness. My method
; - is mine alone. My treatment Is origi-
nal. In some features It resembles the
ordinary. In its chief essentials it Is '
different. In result* It is entirely dif-
ferent. It is safe, prompt and thor-
: . ough, . J-
Til* above, together with OrÂ»
sranic . Weakness. Spermatorrhoea, j
I Lost "Via or. ! Specific . Blood Poison,
Stricture, Piles and Reflex Ail-
ments, constitute my Specialty and .
are the only diseases I treat.

CALLS ENGLISH PEOPLES
TO GUARD WEAK NATIONS
Would Check "International Highwaymen'
Strong Plea for
Anglo-Saxon
Co-Work.
REV. I. C. MESERVE, D. D.
Pastor Plymouth Congregational Church.
Power and wealth are the quest of
i the nations. They pay less attention
jto morality. Were they wise they
j would seek quality as eagerly as quan
| tity. Rulers of nations are often more
cunning or canny than wise. The great
: nations of the earth have long been
: playing the game of grab, seeking ter
ritorial extension for the purpose of
; placing their increasing populations, of
1 extending trade, and ot gaining glory.
! None of these are wholly reprehensible
â  reasons for exuansion, but there are
â  others that are far better. The writer
, was living in England during the
earlier years of the Boer war. The
best people of Britain opposed that
! war on the ground of its immorality.
They held that the interests of dia
mond and golddiggers were not the in
terests of the British people nor of hu
, manity. They were right, yet the na
tion at large backed the Government
, in prosecuting the war from a mixture
\ of savage and sordid instincts, plus the
natural but mistaken sentiment of pa
triotism. The war now raging in Man
churia was brought about by the greed
of one of the belligerents, as we all
know. It was the same greed of land
and trade that has forced so many
struggles and cost so much blood and
treasure in modern times. This pur
suit is not moral.
In South America civilization makes
, slow progress because the ruling
classes are white and the ruled are
chiefly colored or mixed. Morals are
low in those countries. In Asia class
division is thousands of years long and
iron in kind. Vast accumulations of
wealth in the hands of the few rulers,
together with a poverty so deep and
hopeless that how the people live at all
is a wonder, mark all those old coun
tries, particularly the best of them.
Julian Hawthorne calls attention to the
state of things in India, in a recent
magazine article, and the state of
things he describes must be the despair
'of all who have the good of India at
heart. It is not at all the fault of Great
Britain, but of the native rulers and of
their civilization and history. In Eu
rope the military spirit is all powerful.
It is not the spirit of the knight errant
of former times, but the cold calcula
tion of science with material advantage
in view. It is an iron game, played
with the courage of heroes and the
brutality of savages. Every nation on
the Continent, until you come to the
borders of Russia, is in the grasp of an
: army, and its morals are the morals of
a campaign. It is not possible that
they should be anything else.
In Russia it is worse. The govern
ment is autocratic, recognizing no re
sponsibility to the people and therefore
tyrannical. It could not be otherwise.
That autocracy is doomed, and some
form and measure of popular govern
ment must come in, but not too fast,
let uf hofe, else the dictator will have
his chance and Liberty go back to
chains.
In Great Britain and America the
ca.Â«=e is a little better. Civilization is
higher, ideals are nobler, history is
> sweeter, and hope is brighter. But in
i both these countries there is a quest
that makes the patriot's heart ache as
he watches it. ft is the quest for
wealth. Civilization has reached that
I point where material good seems all
I important to the general mind. A tre
mendous spirit of acquisition is
abroad, a determination to amass
i wealth, by hook or by crook, anyhow.
i Men sell themselves to evil with as
! tonishing cheapness, seeing only im
1 mediate gain. Native born are no bet-
J ter than foreign born in this respect,
,we must with shame confess. Per
j sonal indulgence in vice, support of
; fountains and institutions from which
, that vice comes, and by which it
thrives, pushing of private gain, at the
j expense of every one else, are the sins
!of the Anglo-Saxon of to-day. Besides
\ this there is the problem of empire,
j which both nations have on hand. In
1 Britain it is a wide empire, of far
; greater extent than the home lands,
I and of most diverse populations and
institutions. Were it simply a matter
I of cannon and battleships it would be
I simple enough, but it is far more than
that. To defend that empire against
1 greedy and hostile nations is an enor

BUFFALO BILL'S DAUGHTER
REFUSES TO BE WITNESS
Mrs. Irma Cody Stotts Will Not Tes
tify in Divorce Suit Now
on Trial.
CHEYENNE, Wyo., Feb. 25.â Mrs.
Irma Cody Stotts, who is thoroughly
converse t with the relations of
Colonel and Mrs. W. F. Cody, will not
be drawn into the case as a witness,
for the youngest daughter of the old
scout has refused to gro upon the wit

either of her parents.
"Of course, I know all about the re
lations between papa and mamma."

mous task, to develop it is a greater
one. At the same time the home pop
ulation must be protected and cared
for, task enough in such times as these.
In this country the problem of em
pire is chiefly -within our own borders.
We have to receive and assimilate an
enormous alien population crowding to
our shores. Wehav: to teach them to
be free, and no greater task has ever
been given a nation since time began.
For the problem of morality is the
problem of liberty! Only the free will
be good. By liberty is not meant its
privileges, but its duties and fitness for
them, a very different thing. The least
Government is the best Government
only when the people are Intelligent
and trustworthy enough to govern
themselves without much supervision.
Great must be the intelligence and
sturdy the conscience of such a people.
There is one force equal to making a
people thus fit for freedom, by mak
ing them thus moral. It is religion.
Not the religion that stands in forms,
either of words or procedure, but in
character and life. It is not the relig
ion found in a state church, that Mid
dle Age ghost strayed into these days.
No state does or can or ought to teach
it or repress it, but only give it a fair
chance. No special form of it has an
instant's right of way in any country
or among any people. It is as free in
its nature and as powerful in its work
ing as the sunlight, and as indispensa
ble as the atmosphere. Such a religion
alone can give the ideals, inspire to the
heroism and sacrifice necessary to in
violable liberty. In no lands does It
have such recognition as in those
where the Anglo-Saxon has his home.
Were it more regarded in these lands
their promi:* would be greater. Only
by being religious and therefore moral
can these nations lead the grand march
of humanity to a blessed future of
peace, prosperity and happiness. The
heroes of both nations were men who
feared God and loved their fellows.
That they did neither as well as they
should does not change the fact that
they did both and therefore built these
nations foursquare and strong. Let
their spirit rule now and still greater
things will follow.
These considerations lead easily to
another, by which the ethics of the
nations might be improved and guard
ed greatly. It is that the Anglo-Sax
on world should undertake this task
together. Their statesmen can do no
worthier service than to find a way
by which their strength may be com
bined to secure the peace of the world
and the betterment of mankind. It is
not necessary that their governments
cannot expect me to take sides in a
matter of this kind. I love both my
parents and to give testimony in this
case would mean that I must lose the
love of one or the other. Divorces are
sometimes necessary, but of the merits
in this case I have nothing to say and
do not care to discuss the matter fur
ther."
Miss Irma Cody was married about
a year ago to Captain Stotts of the
United States army and went to Texas
with her husband.
If you have a thought that will bet
ter the world turn it loose in print so it
will travel.

should be unified, or even any hard
and fast treaty obligations incurred.
It is only necessary that they should
agree to be friends and to stand by
each other in all that will further
these great objects. They alone of
all the nations can do this and that
they ought to do it few will deny. To
be sure, both must rise above selfish
interest in some degree. Both must
forget certain bitternesses born of the
;>ast and certain jealousies growing
out of the greatness of both; but since
their ideals are so nearly the same
and since the , opportunity and need
are both so great it. is not unreason
able to ask them to do this thing. It
is but to recognize the responsibility
which the strong and enlightened na
tion has for the weaker and less en
lightened, not to conquer but to help,
not to exploit but to teach and lead.
What Great Britain is doing for the
many peoples under her care and
what this nation is doing for the few
outside our borders that we have in
hand, we might unitedly do for a
great portion of the globe and its in
habitants. Their combination must
be strong enough to check certain
highwaymen in international relations
and to instill wholesome regard for
human rights and just a little pity
for human sorrows. To such a union
of forces the great God seems plainly
calling the peoples of Great Britain
and the United States. Will they not
heed the call and so promote ethnic
ethics as nothing else can do?

them with malfeasance in office, were

day and the Judge reserved his deci

against them an application would be
made either for a writ of mandate or

matter before the Supreme Court to

object would be to have the prelimi

As the Mayor has rendered his de

John C. Jones, a carriage black
smith, who lived at 203 Twelfth street,

ROME, Feb. 25.â With reference to
the new bill on the state assuming the
management of railways, the Socialist
organization of Italy, with 200,000 mem
bers, is not content with the terms pro
posed to be given to the workmen. The
heads of the railway workmen's or
ganizations held a meeting this after
noon, which was attended by leading
Socialist Deputiesâ Bissolati, Cabrini
and Margari â and decided upon a pol
icy of obstruction, not only in the
chamber, but in the working of the
railroad traffic. The Cabinet will meet
to take immediate steps to deal with
the situation.
In the Chamber of Deputies this aft
ernoon the Socialists twice attempted
obstruction, but were defeated by the
action of the large majority that op
posed them. It is expected that they
will provoke trouble at the next sitting
of the chamber.
Reports received by the Government
from Prefects in the provinces state
that obstruction of traffic has begun
everywhere. All trains are delayed
from three to four hours. Passengers
are demanding the return of their
fares, refusing to continue their jour
neys. Many freight trains have been
taken off, owing to inability to get
their crews. There Is general public
disapproval of the action of the rail
way employes and great indignation is
expressed.

St. Louis Politician
Attacked by a
Woman.
ST. LOUIS, Feb. 25. â Jeptha D.
Howe, chairman of the Republican
County Central Committee, was to-day
the victim of an attack by a young
woman armed with a bottle of car
bolic acid, in his office in the Com
mercial building. Howe's face was
badly burned and one eye was in
jured.
The young woman is said to have
been a former stenographer for Howe.
She entered his office unannounced,
and, disregarding the present stenog
rapher, pushed the door open and en
tered Howe's room. Alphonse Howe,
who was in an adjoining room, heard
his brother and the woman talking
earnestly for some time. Then there
was a cry of pain from the man and
the woman fled from his office and
out of the building, weeping bitterly.
She had dashed the contents of the
bottle of carbolic acid at Howe's face,
but, fortunately, most of the liquid
was spattered on the wall behind him.
Howe is prominent* in politics. He
was at one time assistant circuit at
torney.

Expects to Appear in

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Feb. 25.â The news that
Sir Henry Irving was stricken by a
chill and had beefn ordered by his med
ical attendants into retirement for two
months came as a great shock to the
social world and to play-goers gener
ally; but it is gratifying to learn that
the actor is now so improved that he
will be able to travel from Wolver
hampton to London to-morrow. He
was, in fact, feeling so much better to
day that he was able to transact some
business and replied personally to a
telegraphic inquiry concerning ar
rangements for his American tour,
which is to begin in San Francisco in
the autumn.
Further medical examination con
firms the opinion that there is no or
ganic disease and that Sir Henry is
only suffering from the rigors of an
unusually severe spell of cold weather,
added to too hard work. Sir Henry
has played in seven towns during the
last month, attended public functions
in every one and made nearly two doz
en speeches. His enforced rest until
the end of April, before which time he
hopes to be fully restored to his usual
health, is more readily accepted by
him since It will enable him, after a
short season in London, to be well pre
pared for his farewell tour in America.
"I am looking forward" he says,
"with great pleasure to meeting again
my many friends In the United States."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Feb. 25. â Maurice Rouvler,
the new French Prime Minister, has
the reputation of being the ablest fin
ancier in France. He has known not
only how to appreciate the value of
money, but also its influence in a
state, politically as well as economic

nation are sound there is nothing to

With all his political principles
transferred to the grounds of finance,
it is noticed occasionally that his ex
pressed opinions very acording to
the times. The only subject on which
he is absolutely uncompromising is
free trade, which he sternly con
demns. But if he judged that the in
terests of the state would benefit
thereby in a new order of things his
friends say that he would bravely en
courage free trade then as he op
poses it now. A few months ago he
vigorously fought the projected in
come tax. When he saw that the Par
liamentary majority was determined
to have it and that no effort of his
could stem the tide he submitted to
the inevitable and has since passed his
time studying the means by which an
income tax could be made most prof
itable to a state and least harmful to
a people.
Similarly he had always expressed
the most marked dislike for sectarian
ism of any description, whether re
ligious or anti-religious. But seeing
that anti-religious sectarianism was
the order of the day in France he has
made the best of it by choosing the
members of his Cabinet from the least
prejudiced men put at his disposal by
the Parliamentary majority on a
strictly anti-clerical programme.
Rouvier was born at Aix, in Provenae,
in 1842, and started life as a lawyer.
He was sent to the Chamber of Depu
ties in 1871 as member for Marseilles,
and was Minister of Commerce in the
Gambetta Cabinet, with Waldeck-
Rousseau, In 1881. In 1887 he formed
a Cabinet of his own, selecting the port
folio of Finance, as he has done in
forming his present Cabinet. In 1889,
in 1890 and in 1892 he was again Min
ister of Finance, resigning in 1893 on
account of the Panama scandal in
â¢which some of his ministerial col
leagues were accused of complicity.
At the .fall of the Waldeck-Rousseau
Cabinet, in June, 1902, he became Min
ister of Finance under Combes, and re
mained at this post until President
Loubet asked him to form the new
Cabinet when Combes resigned.
Rouvler is a man of heavy build, who
walks with his head thrown forward,
ias if he were hurling himself against
an adversary. The truth is that he is
very near-sighted, and he is constantly
pulling at his eyeglasses, jerking them
on and off or snapping the spring in
j his fingers. He gesticulates freely
when speaking and often pounds hfs
desk with his closed fists. He has a
wonderful talent for condensation in
speech, and his line of argument is
sufficiently % sound to confound his op
ponents on most occasions.

DEXIES PEACE RUMORS.
Japanese Minister Says No Overtures
Hnve Been Made.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2a.â Japan,
through her Minister in Washington,
has categorically and absolutely de
nied all rumors and reports that she
was suing for peace or that any act of
the Mikado's representative here can
be possibly so construed. The Minis
ter added that the "peace talk of the
last few days is not created in Japan,
but emanates from some other land."
Japan, it was declared, has made all
arrangements to continue the war for
at least another year. The Japanese
Minister said:
"It has been clearly understood from
the outset that Japan has not been
fighting for the sake of fighting, but
that she was forced to war for the
sake of principle, and the result has
been thus far in favor of Japan. She
has fortunately been the victor at
every battle cm land and sea. This
seemed to have led to the general im
pression that Japan can make over
tures fox peace without so much in
convenience as otherwise would be the
case, and that it must be Japan which
is in a positon to take the initiative in
ending the war. Consequently this
impression appears to have created the
rumor that Japan gave expression
through me to a desire of peace.
"But there is not one bit of truth in
this rumor. You can deny it on my
authority absolutely and without reser
vation. Japan has not given any sue!:
expression through me â I repeat it
most emphatically.
"You will readily understand whether
Japan can make such overtures or not
if you give a little consideration to
the actual circumstances. While It is
true that Japan has been honored with
success of her arms so far, it Is equally
true that this has had no apparent ef
fect on Russia. Through her repre
sentatives Russia has been constantly
declaring that she will fight to the end
or until she wins one or more decisive
battles. We think it is not queer for
such a large country as Russia, a
country with such enormous strength
of men and such an extraordinary
amount of resources, to think of a final
success in the war with us. We have
therefore prepared to fight as long as it
is necessary, and it was only some
weeks ago that the imperial Diet voted
for the war budget to run from April.
1905, until March, 1906."
INSURANCE FIRM AFRAID TO
GUARANTEE BEEF SHIPMENT
Cargo for Vladivostok Abandoned by
Getz Bros. Because Policy-
Ma kors Protested.
Out of the uncertainty of trade in
Russian ports during war times, which
frightens both shippers and insurance
men. a suit at law has grown. Yes
terday Getz Brothers began action
against the St. Paul Fire and Marine
Insurance Company to recover $2 8,
400, representing the insurance writ
ten by the defendants upon shipments
of barreled beef for Vladivostok.
The first lot was insured on Sep
tember 15, 1903. for $5000, another lot
for $900 in December and a third con.
signment of 4000 barrels for $22,500
on February 4, 1904. All of the beef
was laden on the steamer China and
was to be forwarded from Nagasaki
to Vladivostok. The policies insured
the meat against capture or seizure,
piracy included, although at the time
war was in progress. On February
25 the defendants, by its agents M. C.
Harrison & Co., protested against for
warding the shipment, and Getz
Brothers abandoned the cargo. Hence
the suit.

DIXISIOV OF COURT.
Judpe Hart's decision in part i 6 as
follows:
'I have given the arguments of coun
sel, and the authorities which they have
cited in support thereof, much consid
eration and thought, and I am per
suaded that, while I at first was much
impressed with the force of the con
tention of counsel for the defendant
upon the question as to whether or not ;
the Legislature, within the scope of its
- prose ribed by the constitu- i
had authority to make investiga- i
tion of put h corporations as those men- ;
tioned in the indictment, the indict- !
. ment is not obnoxious to the objections
and criticisms alleged against it.
â  1 have no doubt that the Legisla
ture, when it, through one of its com
mitt^ee. proceeds to investigate the
methods and the management of quasi
publ: uons for the purpose of
obtaining knowledge that will facilitate
and bring about more wholesome laws
in the matter of the regulation and
management of guch corporations, is
ed in the performance of such a
duty as conges clearly within its prov
ince as a legislative body, and within

THE VALUE OF CHAROOAIi.
Few People Know How Useful It Is In
Preserving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant end purifier in nature, but
few realize Its value when taken into
the human system for the same cleans-
ing purpose.
Charcoal Is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; it is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
grases and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines and carries
m out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion, it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in. the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal In one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money
Is in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they
are composed of the finest powdered
Willow charcoal and other harmless
antiseptics in tablet form, or rather in
th*> form of large, pleasant tasting
lozenges, the charcoal being mixed
with honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
coon tell in a much improved condi-
tion of the general health/ better com-
plexion, tweeter breath and purer
blcod. and the beauty of it is that no
possible harm can result from their
continued* use. but, on the contrary
great benefit.
A Buffalo physician, in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I ad-
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to ail
patients suffering from gas in stomach
aad bowels, and to clear the complex-
ion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat: I also believe the liver is great-
ly benefited by the daily use of them*
they cost but twenty-five cents a box at
drug stores, and, although in some
â¢ sense a patent preparation, yet I be-
lieve I get more and better charcoal in
Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges than in
cry of the ordinary charcoal tablets."

a visional or supervisorial power, but
whatever its proper designation, it is
in my judgment, nevertheless, a power
that exists, and one which ought to
exist.
"6o it is my opinion that the Legis
lature, or either branch thereof, has
plenary power to inquire into the af
fairs of such corporations. Indeed, how
would the Legislature know when to
exercise the power of reform or amend
ment in any law or set of laws devising
\eme for the transaction of busi
ness without some knowledge of how
and with what result the laws already
in existence operate?
DUTY OF LEGISLATURE.
'I am of the opinion that where com
pialnts that are not In such form as to
bring them within judicial cognizance
are made against such corporations it
is the duty of the Legislature to act
upon those complaints and give the
management of such corporations
thorough investigation for the purpose
already suggested.
"The conclusion necessarily follows,
from the view? thus expressed, that
il" a matter is ponding before a commit
tee of tithe* house of the Legislature
of the character described in the in
dictment and s member of such com
mittee accepts a bribe or a reward as
a consideration for influencing his vote,
<iotion or judgment thereon, such act
brings his conduct within the purview
of the law against bribery.
"Th^ second point, that the indict
ment does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a public offense, I believe to
be untenable. It is contended that if
the Legislature has the authority to
make the investigation here mentioned
the indictment does net state a public
offense because it does not show that
the matter of proceeding before the
Legislature was legally pending be
fore it.
"A fundamental rule of criminal
pleading is that if the indictment or in
formation apprises the accused of the
charge which he will be called upon
to defend it is sufficient. I think the
indictment in this case is sufficient in
this regard."

Sensational Divorce Suit of
the Gays Gives Way to
an Action for Desertion
Special DUoateh to ThÂ» Call.
SAN DIEGO, Feb. 25.â The divorce
suit of Lucille D. Gay against John H.
Gay, which ha 6 occupied the attention
of the courts here and elsewhere and
to some extent the Legislature of Cali
fornia, through the charges preferred
against Judge Torrance, has been set
tled.
The papers in the sensational suit
filed by Mrs. Gay some months ago
were withdrawn yesterday. A new ac
tion was immediately brought by Mrs.
Gay, in which the simple charge of
desertion was made. An answer deny
ing the charge wu filed immediately
and last night at a special session
Judge Conklin granted the interlocu
tory decree of divorce, findings being
waived by both parties.
Mrs. Gay and her sister were the only
witnesses, the defense offering no tes
timony. It is understood that a settle
ment has been reached out of court
by the terms of which Mrs. Gay is to
be paid $100 a month.
The withdrawal of all the papers in
the old cape relieves the clerks of the
office of the care of several hundred
pounds of paper, there being nine
drawers full of the complaints, counter
complaints, affidavits and depositions.

VICTORY FOR PRE9COTT.
Speaker Goes to Senate and Wins Fac-
tional Fight.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 25. â Speaker
Prescott abandoned his high office in
the Assembly to-day and went over
Into the Senate, where he won a fight
In quick order against Senator Leeke,
who also comes from San Bernardino.
The incident disciosed a pretty fac
tional fight, developed over the late
Senatorial contest in their home
county, with Prescott, who voted for
Flint, a prominent member of one,
and Leeke, a Bard supporter, the
leader of the other.
Prescotts bill providing for the in
crease of the salaries of certain of
ficials of San Bernardino County came
up this morning and Leeke said he
would like to make certain amend
ments. He thereupon cut down the
increases provided for in Prescott's
measure and provided for increases in
other offices. As the bill alone per
tained to San Bernardino County the
amendments were adopted without
opposition.
But this afternoon Preseolt, who
heard of the action of Leeke, hurried
to the Senate and started the fight. It
soon developed that- all the officials
provided with an increase of salary in
Prescott's bill belong to his wing of
the party and that those subsequently
favored by Leeke are friendly to his
faction.
It didn't take Prescott more than ten
minutes to do his work and then a mo
tion to reconsider the vote on the
amendments prevailed. One by one,
Leeke's amendments were knocked out,
the Senate standing with Prescott.
Leeke is angry clear through and ex
presses the opinion that the incident is
not closed yet.
WORK DELAYED
ON LIGHTHOOSE
Rough Weather Threatens
Platform Constructed to
Facilitate the Operations
Work has been temporarily suspend
ed on the lighthouse now being con
structed on the rock in the harbor en
trance that sent the Rio Janeiro to its
doom. The water was so rough that
it threatened the wooden platform
built over the rock to facilitate opera
tions, and Contractor McMahon was
forced to call a halt in the work, which
will be resumed at the end of the
month.
The undertaking, while a bold one.
promises to be a success. The plan con
templates the erection of a circular,
steel-framed lighthouse, standing upon
a base of concrete inclosed in steel. No
simijar structure has ever been at
tempted on the Pacific Coast. The dif
ficulties to be overcome were not ex
ceeded even by the famous light at
Yaqujna Bay, which almost exhaust
ed tfl* engineering capacity of the Gov
ernment.
Mile Reck stands in the channel at
a Bpot where the tides are strongest
and the currents most powerful. Ap
proach is impossible except in the
calmest weather. An average of one
day In the week permits access. Work
has been frequently interrupted for
weeks at a time.
The rock at high water presented an
elliptical base, having a length of 40
feet and an average width of 30 feet. It
was necessary to step the rock to
these dimensions in order to afford an
anchorage for the foundation.
A well ten feet in diameter was
driven through the rock down to high
water level, with a pumproom at the
bottom. No dynamite could be used,
owing to the softness of the rock. All
the cutting was done by manual labor.
From the pumproom a hole was drilled
twenty-six feet in length to below low
water level to contain a bronze pipe for
drawing water for cooling purposes.
The erection of a wooden platform
was attended with difficulty. On this
the first course of the three-eighth
inch steel cylinder was put together
and carefuly lowered to its place on the
rock. Concrete, mixed on the platform,
was then tamped around the cylinder
until the space vu filled. Another
course of steel wu lowered, and after
being riveted was also filled, and thus
the work has slowly progressed until
to-day ten courses have been built up
thirty feet in height and solid enough
to withstand the most powerful seas.
Yesterday the waves washed over the
top and work had to be suspended.
By the end of the month, weather
permitting, the two remaining steel
courses with concrete filling will be
in place and the platform will then
stand thirty-four feet aboVe high wa
ter and ready for the superstructure.
Contractor McMahon estimates the
weight of steel and concrete in the
foundations alone at 1600 tons. No
wave strong enough to move it has
ever entered the bay. Above the foun
dation will stand a tour-story steel
frame tower fitted with a third class
light and a powerful ten-Inch siren
driven by compressed air.
The light will have a radius of fif
teen miles. The tower construction is
completed and all ready to be put in
place. It is believed that by me first

BALMY WEATHER ENTICES
TENNIS EXPERTS TO COURTS
Miss Vnn Vliet and Miss Myer Play
Till Dark in the Handi
cap Singles.
The balmy weather yesterday :.t
tracted many players to the tennis
courts, which were crowded all day.
On the park courts the young ladies
participated in a handicap singles
tournament for the Cochran cup. The
event was not completed. Miss Van
Vliet and Miss Golda Myer played
one set in the finals, when darkness
put a stop to play. . Miss Van Vliet
won the set by a score of 6-3. The
match will be completed to-morrow
afternoon.
Mlbs Wegener, who won the last
tournament, was beaten easily by Miss
Van Vliet in the semi-finals.
Miss Wegener was placed "2-6"
farther behind scratch than previ
ously, and Miss Van Vliet. with the
small handicap allowed her, proved
an easy winner. The score was
6-3, 6-2.
The other semi-final match was
much closer. The contestants were
Miss Myer and Mrs. Watson. After
each had won a one-sided set, Miss
Myer took the third by the close score
of 7-5.
On the California Club courts some
excellent practice matches were
played. H. Long and G. Janes played
a tie with H. Schmidt and H. Rolfe.
Each side won three sets, but as
Schmidt and Rolfe won three sets out

INDOOR TENNIS
WILL BE TRIED
Many Players Enter in the
Tournaments of Coming
Exhibition at Pavilion
The indoor tennis tournaments,
which will be played in April in con
nection with the Forest, Fish and
Game exhibition at the Mechanics'
Pavilion, are attracting unusual at
tention. The entry list closed yester
day and contains the names of all the
best players around the bay. Fifty
players entered the singles event, while
twenty-four teams will compete in the
doubles.
When the indoor tournaments were
first mentioned many of the players
thought it was only idle taik. The
committee in charge has been working
for weeks and all arrangements have
be>n completed. If the floor is put
into proper shape and the lights are
properly arranged some fast tennis
will be witnessed. The game will be
considerably faster on wood than on
asphalt. The players who qualify will
be given several days in which to
practice at the pavilion and accus
tom themselves to the electric lights
and board flooring.
The two tournaments will be played
dewn to the serni-flnals before the end
of March. The singles will be played
on the park courts and the doubles on
the California Club courts. The semi
finals and finals of both will be played
at Mechanics' Pavilion.
1 In the doubles an unusual number
of good teams are entered. In the up
per half are the Baker brothers, Long
and Janes, Whitney and Griffin.
Schmidt and Rolfe and Long and
Gardner. In the lower half are Dun
lap and Foley, Hill and McChesney
and the Hotchkiss brothers.
In the singles the strongest players
are Percy Murdock and George Baker.
They drew in opposite halves. The

ine Tuhte, as administratrix of the
estate of Peter J. Postel, it is set forth
that the defendants are occupying the
premises in violation of the statute
relating to tide lands.
It is claimed that Poatel acquired
title to the property in 1866. He died
in 1873 and the administratrix was
appointed in September, 1901. She
demanded possession of the lots in
December of that year and was re
fused. Since then, she says, the rents
have been worth 515,000, for which
she asks judgment, in addition to pos
session of the property.
MARINE ENGINEER IS
SUFFOCATED BY GAS
William Warm Lies Dead in His
Room for Several Days Before
Being Discovered.
William Warm, a marine engineer,
was found dead yesterday in a dingy
room on the fourth floor of the Mont
gomery block, 628 Montgomery street.
He had been dead for several days.
Gas was escaping from a stove in the
center of the room.
R. B. Kurtz informed Deputy Cor
oner Fenhell that the gas inspector
shut oft* the gaa at the meter several
days ago in order to ascertain whether
a leak existed or not, the lessee of the
building having found the conÃumD
tion of gas to be much above normal.
It was turned on again after a few
hours.
The theory is advanced that Warm,
who had been sick for the past two
months, had the stove burning at the
time the inspector shut off the sup
ply. This extinguished the flame and
when the supply was turned on again
the sick man waa suffocated.
In the Divorce Court.
Suit for divorce was begun yester
day by Mabel Beckett against Harry
Beckett on the grounds of cruelty and
neglect. They were married in Au
gust, 1902. and the husband has not
done much work since. While Mrs.
Beckett was conducting a millinery
establishment at 657 Ellis street, she
says, he visited strange women who
lived above the store. Judge Murasky
granted a divorce to George Schemer
from Mabel Schemer on the ground of
infidelity. John Cline was named as
co-respondent.
BOSTON MILLIONAIRE IS NOW
MASTER OF INVERARY CASTLE
Duke ol Argyll, King Edward's Brotlier-in-Law, Rents
Historic Home ol Fathers to E. D. Jordan.
PICTURESQUE HOME IN THE WEST HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND OF THE
DUKES OF ARGYLL., WHICH THE PRESKNT WEARER OF THE- HISTORIC
TITLE HAS JUST LEASED TO A BOSTON MILLIONAIRE.
LONDON, Feb. 25.â Inverary Castle,
' the famous seat of tl.e Dukes of
Argyll, which has been leased to E. D.
Jordan, the Boston millionaire, is the
most palatial residence in the west of
[ Scotland and few of the stately homes
j of England can vie with it in historic
interest. The home of the Campbells
since early in the fourteenth century,
the castle has been the scene of some
of the most romantic and stirring in
cidents in the annals of Scotland.
Much fighting has taken place around
it. The forces of Montrose i.nd the
great Argyll there met in bloody fray,
and the neighboring hill; and glens
I witnessed some of Rob Roy's most dar
j ing exploits.
To Highlanders, who still retain
something of the traditions of their
ancient clans, it will seem little short
of sacrilege that such a place should
be crccupied by a. foreigner. It v-s 1
; one of the warrior Argylls who said
: centuries ago, "I would not for a hun
1 dred thousand crowns any mortal
I should know the passes by which an
armed force could penetrate into my
country." But times have greatly
j changed since those old strenuous days
j and what force often failed to accom
; plish becomes an easy task for the all
! conquering American dollars.
The Duke of Argyll owns 170,000
I acres, but they are Scotch acres and |
, with agriculture steadily declining
i they do not bring him in anything like
as much money as pours over the
! counters of a big American department
' store. When his father died in 1900,
, the necessity of meeting the heavy
' death dues so greatly impoverished
I him that he could not afford the lux
ury of residing at Inverary Castle him
self. He needed the rent to enable ,
' him to make both ends meet and let
the place to A. F. B. Cresswell. It is j
Creswell who, with the Duke's con
i sent, has sublet it to Jordan.

The Duke of Argyll, it will be re
called, when he was Marquis of Lome,
broke through all the traditions of
English royalty by marrying in 1871
the Princess Louise, the cleverest of
Queen Victoria's five daughters. She
has long resided with her ducal hus
band at Kensington Palace and is well
content with an arrangement which
allows her to retain such convenient
quarters. She has built herself a stu
dio there. and much prefers it to a
Highland residence.
Built for strength rather than grace
the ancient fortress is still a pictur
esque pile, typical of the stormy
scenes amid which it arose. It is con
structed of an uncommon material â
a talcose chlorate slate brought from
the other side of Loch Fyne. Ex
tremely soft but very durable, this
blue-gray stone has the peculiarity
that the slightest rain turns it almost
black, but the sunshine brings back
quite as speedily its original hue.
In the apartments of the castle are
many fine pictures by the old masters
and priceless relics. The grounds
around it are magnificent and well
adapted for sporting purposes, which
it is understood constitute the chief
attractions of the place for its new
tenant. In the park are trees that
were planted by Queen Victoria, the
late German Emperor, Gladstone,
Tennyson, Bright, Livingstone and
other notables.

EXTRACT GOLD
FROM THE SEA
Englishmen in Xew Company
Have High Hopes for the
Success of Experiment
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
LONDON, Feb. 25.â With recollec
tions still fairly fresh of the colossal
fraud perpetrated some years ago in
Maine by which thousands were led
to believe that huge fortunes could be
made by investing in a scheme for
extracting gold from the sea, the
American public will probably place
little faith in reports of the wonderful
results achieved here by a new pro
cess of obtaining the auriferous metal
from the ocean.
The American scheme was a down
right swindle. A diver placed in the
accumulators at night the gold which
Father Neptune was supposed to have
deposited there with such reckless
prodigality. The English scheme is not
a swindle. At present it is simply a
scientific experiment.
The estimates made of the money
that could thus be coined out of the
sea transcend the fabulous wonders of
the Arabian Nights, and by compari
son make even Sinbad's valley of dia
monds appear an unattractive propo
sition to the credulous Investor.
Rockefeller's wealth is but a beggar's
pittance contrasted with the riches that
would be amassed by the syndicate
controlling the secret process.
While none of these gross exaggera
tions can be attributed to Lord Tweed
dale, Lord Brassey, Allan Gibbs, Major
General Henderson, Major Coats, M.
P., W. Keswick, M. P., and the other
highly respectable men associated with
the Engineering and Industrial Trust
which is backing the scheme, the fact
that the reports had the effect of send
ing up the $5 shares to $260 would indi
cate that some of those who were let
in on the ground floor found abundant
opportunities to make a most profit
able exit.
RAMSAY'S NAME USED.
Sir William Ramsay was credited
with having stated that the inventor's
process had demonstrated that gold
could be obtained from the sea in such
large quantities that whether the cost
of treatment were $20 or even $40 per
ton of sea water, which was the out
side figure, it made little difference.
It is, of course, impossible that a
man of Sir William Ramsay's high
reputation and attainments could have
made such a ridiculous statement.
With an expenditure of $20 for every
ton of salt water treated, the syndi
cate would become bankrupt faster
than kny company ever floated. Sir
William's assistant, R. D. Littlefleld,
waa quoted as having stated to thÂ«
shareholders that they had only to de
cide how much gold they wanted â¢
day and it could be produced. On tha
basis of dealing with 400 acres of sea
every twenty-four hours, he estimated
that the yield of gold would be over
535.000.000 per annum.
It would be interesting to know Just
what Sir William Ramsay did report,
but that information was refused at
thÂ« office of the company. However,
the facts given out by F. I* Rawson.
thÂ« consulting engineer of the syndi
cate and one of the highest authori
ties on new invention in London,
suffice to prove how utterly fallacious
are the extraordinary claims that have
been made on behalf of the new pro
cess.
TRUTH OF SITUATION.
It had been found by analysis, he
said, that the gold held In solution in
the Irish Sea and the English Channel
varied from one-thirtieth to one-flftieth
of a Â«^-ain per ton of water. That
means, of course, that provided all of
it could be extracted, from thirty I
fifty tons of water would have to bo
treated to obtain one grain of sold,
which is worth four and one-quÂ»rter
cents. Such figures hardly suggest ths
possibility that the ocean will ev-r
prove a formidable rival of the world's
gold mining industries.
Rawson frankly admitted that with
the amount of gold held in solution
so minute, the problem of making its
extraction from salt water commer
cially profitable was an extremely dif
ficult one, but he was confident that -
could be done. The syndicate, he said,
was a private one formed for the pur
pose of supplying sufficient capital to
thoroughly test the process. A small
plant has been established on the south
coast capable of dealing with from
forty to fifty tons at a time. The re
sults thus far obtained hÂ© regarded as
"satisfactory," but much remained to
be done before the process could be
established on a commercial scale. As
to the nature of the process, he de
clined to give any particulars.
J. H. Snell, 'the inventor of it, hft3
been at work on it for twenty-six
years. He was at the head of a firm
of stained glaf/ enamel manufacturers
when he made the discovery which
started him on the hunt for gold in the
sea. While carrying out some experi
ments in connection with his glass
business he left a glass rod in the sea
for a year. When he removed it h^
found that lt had turned yellow, and
ascertained by analysis thai the "yel
low" was gold. The process wh:
now being tested Is the fourth that he
has devised. The three previous ones
proved failures. The last of them had
to be discarded as too dangerous, after
lt had killed his partner and laid him
self up for eight months. This waa
due to the poisonous chemicals em
ployed. He is sanguine that hÂ« has
struck the right thing now.

transmitted to The Call and the New York
Herald for simultaneous publication.
NAPLES, Feb. 25.â Mrs. Catherine
MacCready, a wealthy American
woman, who formerly lived in New
York, was found strangled in her villa
near Caserta early this morning. She
had been dead for days, according to
the testimony of physicians at the
Coroner's inquest later in the day.
That robbery was the motive of the
crime was easily apparent. The small
safe in her bedroom, in which it was
supposed she kept jewels and money,
had been opened and the contents
scattered about the floor of the apart
ment. Whether anything of value was
taken is not definitely known.
Mrs. 3\|acCready, though wealthy,
was eccentric. Although she occu
pied a commodious house, .she had no
household servants. She had no
friends and few acquaintances. She
was accustomed to come to Naples at
times and little notice was taken of
her absence until to-day the fears of
an aged man employed by her that
she might be ill in the house induced
the authorities to enter. The body
was found on the floor of a bedroom.
The woman had been strangled by a
powerful man and even after the lapse
of time the finger marks were faint
ly discernible on her throat

STOCK MARKET
IN EXCITEMENT
Violent Speculation in Pa
cific Railroad Shares
Marks Close of the Week
NEW YORK. Feb. 25.â The stock
market was thrown into excitement
again to-day by the violent speculation
in the trunk lines and Pacific railroad
stocks and there was a full revival of
the speculative enthusiasm of the
earlier part of the week, which was
chilled by the break of Thursday con
sequent upon the feverish movement
in the Southern iron stocks. A glance
at to-day's sale list will disclose how
highly congested were these opera
tions in the few speculative leaders of
the day and a study of the day's net
changes reveals that the emotional phase
of the trading was not so overwhelm
ing as to preclude a thrifty disposi
tion to take profits on a very large
scale in numerous stocks. Rumors and
intimations have circulated in many
weeks in Wall Street that the control
of the New York Central, Chicago and
Northwestern and Union Pacific was
being worked to a conditon of perfect
harmony, if not of identity. The belief
in the substantial base of the central
project pointed to by this cloud of
rumors was the professed basis for
the excited buying to-day of the stocks
concerned. The new variation of the
story was the inclusion of Pennsyl
vania in the benefits of the' project by
an agreement with New York Cen
tral for the division of sphere of opera
tions. It will be seen that in its gen
eral lines this report follows existing
relations among the properties con
cerned. The consequence of the mcrve
ment was a price during to-day's trad
ing of 160Â»6 for New York Central,
144% for Pennsylvania, 167% for Union
Pacific and 249 for Chicago and North
western. There are gains elsewhere in
the list reaching a point in some cases,
but there are also small declines as the
result of the heavy realizing of the flay
and Union Pacific Itself closed un
changed from last night. The bank
statement was regarded as favorable
and rallied the market from its con
siderable reaction, but the closing was
irregular.
The total sales of bonds to-day, par
value, $3,410,000.
The speculative spirit has run high :
during the week, notwithstanding the
interruption of the midweek holiday.
The buoyant closing on Tuesday was
taken up on Thursday morning and
the market showed many signs of the
growing share in the trading by the
outside public. Hopes were lifted of a
speculative boom such as is brought
about by a widespread craze among
the people at large, infected by an en
thusiasm to buy. Ordinary considera
tions of intrinsic values and calcula
tions of relative values or technical con
ditions based on the preceding rise in
prices make for little when such a spir- 1
it is thoroughly aroused and the stock
market world enjoys a harvest period.
The stirrings of this spirit in the
week's dealings have been suggested
by the lack of actual news, of the ig
noring of unfavorable news, which has
characterized some of it. The violence
and extravagance of some of .the
movements reached such proportions
as to beget suspicion and uneasiness
and the result was a check and a set- '
back on Thursday, which had the effect
of quieting the excitement and induc
ing a more rational state in the mar- :
ket. Attention has centered largely
on the group of Southern iron and steel
stocks. The convulsive movements in
these stocks have been caused by the
working of a plan to secure control of .
the properties and to merge them.
The actual details of this plan and j
the steps toward its accomplish
ment have been obscure and subject to
much conflicting rumor? The counter
claims put out from time to time led
to the fear that they were based on
purchases from sellers who were not
in possession of holdings to be deliv
ered; in other words, that a corner had
resulted with a large uncovered short
interest In the stocks. With the vivid
recollections of the effects upon the
market of the Northern Pacific corner
it was natural that this fear should
weigh on the market. Other centers
of special attention were Union Pacific
and Ontario and Western, both of
which were subjects 6f vague rumors
of important developments to come. |
These rumors were not confirmed.
Gee, whiz, but they do say that a ;
teacher in the Atchison public schools
can hand out as hot a bunch of slang
in five minutes as any boy ever handed j
out in six weeks.

Indian, driven insane because her hus
band had deserted her for another
woman, committed suicide before the
wickiup of her successful rival, east
of this city, this morning.
The family trouble began a few days
ago, when the woman discovered her
husband was associating with another
woman. A fight ensued, in which
Hattie was stabbed slightly. A separa
tion followed, and the suicide to-day
is the result. The dead woman left a

DARK TOWN SHOW
ENDS IN A RIOT
Sheriff Attaches Receipts
of Box Office and Angry
Negroes Start Bough House
The Sheriff held sway last night at
' the "colossal colored carnival,"
v/hich drew a moderate sized crowd to
the Mechanics' Pavilion. The box re
ceipts, consisting of the fabulous sum
i of $20, were seized by his deputies on
a writ of attachment issued from the
Justices' Court yesterday afternoon.
"Jake" Raver, the collection agency
man, was the cause of the proceed
ings. The filing of the attachment
. was the result of the failure of one
; "Senator" Harry Hamden (colored),
promoter of the show, to pay to
Raver the sum of $280 loaned in Jan
uary on a promissory note for thirty
days.
At 9 o'clock Under Sheriff William
Hynes and three deputies entered the
hall. Deputy McManus was imme
diately installed in the box office to see
that all the money taken ifi found its
way into the cash drawer. Although
the hall filled with a surprising rapid
ity, the coin did not drop with corre
sponding alacrity into the till. So
many were the "complimentaries" that
the doorkeepers were obliged again
and again to empty the ticket boxes
of their weight in deadhead paper.
"Senator" Hamden tore his hair and
raged about the hall when he ascer
tained that the Sheriff was to confis
cate the proceeds.
The musicians received the tip that
the Sheriff was present and demanded
their money before dispensing any
more airs. Hamden slipped into the
office, eluded the vigilance of the dep
uty and extracted enough coin to com
pensate the clamoring horn-blowers.
When the moment came to gather
in the coin the City Hall station was
phoned to for aid. A motley crowd
of colored people quickly gathered and
open threats were made against the
Sheriff's deputies. Deputy Sheriff
MuManus seized the receipts that were
left, $20 in all, and ran with the money
to the City Hall station. Fifty or
sixty excited negroes crowded around
the deputies and forced them to the
wall.
At this juncture Lieutenant Colby
of the City Hall station entered and
aliowed the crowd to force its way into
the box office, while he held a heated
argument with Pugilist Jack Johnson.
Several of the negroes made a rush
for the till, with a hope of capturing
the money and aiding their friend, the
promoter, and had it not been for Pa
trolman Cornelius and four other po
licemen a fight would probably have
occurred. A drunken colored man at
tempted to tlourish a razor, but was
not arrested. Lieutenant Colby shoving
the offending would-be assailant from
the room, letting him go free.
After a wrangle of many minutes,
Lieutenant Colby, although he had
nothing to do with the attachment,
agreed on terms with the colored
pugilists, Jack Johnson and "Denver
Ed" Martin, who promised to see that
Hamden paid his Just debts.
Under Sheriff Hynes, realizing that
the $20 secured would not be enough
for the thirsty Raver, agreed to per
mit the show to run in the hope of
getting $2 or $3 more, provided the
ratio of dead-head slips did not in
crease with the influx of late comers.
The band played on and the main por
; tion of the audience laughed, all un
1 mindful that bloodshed had been nar
j rowly averted. Henry A. Hellweger
was associated with "Senator" Ham
den in the management of the show.
CHESBRO'S "FADE AWAY" WTLIi
RIVAL FAMOUS "SPIT BAUj"
\ New York Twirler Invents a CArve
That Is Guaranteed to Terrorize
Any Batsman.
BOSTON, Feb. 25. â Not satisfied
with his spit ball, which gained him
fame last season. Jack Chesbro has a
new variety of the same puzzler that
he calls the "fade away." Talking to
day, Chesbro said: "I have a variety
of spit ball which I call the "fade â 
away" and also a few more I have not '
, yet named. Tell you what, you come [
: out to Harvard, where I am coaching,
; and I'll make you tfirow U p both
hands. I'll not tell you just what the
"fade away" is, for I'm going to keep I
, this new one a secret, but it is a para
; lyzer. It will make Ames* "stop" ball ',
i look like stage money.
In discussing the spit ball, Chesbro ,
', said: "The only way to break it up is
: to put the pitcher either near the bats
j man or farther away. To abolish the
i foul strike would not help matters in I
the leagt." By this it would seem
I Chesbro considers the present pitch- i
ing distance just right to get the great- !
l est effectiveness from that terror to
batsmen.

Interesting Experiment in a Restaur-
* ?, ant.
An advertising agent, representing a
prominent New York magazine, while
on a recent Western trip, was dining
one evening in a Pittsburg restaurant.
While waiting for his order he
glanced over his newspaper and no-
ticed the advertisement of a -well-
known dyspepsia preparation. Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets. As he himself
was a regular user of the tablets he !
began speculating as to how many
of the other traveling men in the
dining-room were also friends of the
popular remedy for indigestion.
He says: 1 counted twenty- three
men at the tables, and in the hotel
office I took the trouble to interview
them and was surprised to learn that
nine of the twenty-three made a
practice of taking one or two of Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets after each
rr\ c* 1 .
one of them told me he had suf-
fered so much from stomach trouble
that, at one time, he had been obliged
to Quit the road, but since using Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets he had been
entirely free from indigestion, but
he continued their use. especially
while traveling, on account of irregu-
larity in meals and because, like all
traveling men. he was often obliged
to eat what he could get and not al-
ways what he wanted.
Another, who looked the picture of
health, said he never ate a meal with-
out taking a Stuart Tablet afterward
because he could eat what he pleased
Â«.nd when he pleased without fear of
a sleepless night or any other trouble.
Still another used them because he
was subject to gas on stomach, caus-
ing pressure on heart and lungs,
6hortnes3 of breath and distress in
chest, which he no longer experienced
El nee using the tablets regularly.
Another claimed that Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets was the only safe
remedy he had ever found for sour
fctomach and acidity. He had for-
merly used common soda to relieve
the trouble, but the tablets were much
better and safer to use.
After fcmoklng, drinking or other
excesses which weaken the digestive
organs, nothing restores the stomach
to a healthy, wholesome condition so
effectually as Stuart's Tablets.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets contain
the natural digestives, pepsin, dias-
tase, which every weak stomach lacks.
as well as nux, hydrastin and yellow
parilla. and can be safely relied on as
a radical cure for every form of poor
digestion. Sold by druggists every-
where.

Committee in Charge of Gub
natorial Contest in Colo
rado Grants More Time
BOTH SIDES CONFIDENT
Governor Adams' Lawyers
See Victory for Client After
Conceding Peabody ? s Claim
DENVER, Colo., Feb. 25.â The Gu
bernatorial Contest Committee to-day
granted the attorneys on both sides an
other day for the preparation of their
briefs in the case. It was arranged
that these documents shall be handed
to Chairman William H. Griffith to
morrow evening, and printed copies
will be distributed among the members
of the committee Monday morning.
Governor Alva Adams' attorneys
practically completed their brief to
night.* In it they assert that, conced
ing all the claims of the contestor,
James H. Peabody, Adams still has a
majority in the State of 2670.
"None of the experts," says the brief,
"have made a special study of hand
writing or of documents. They report
ed on ballots from sixty-three precincts
at the rate of two ballots per minute,
and found the same handwriting in
every box.
"The testimony renders impossible,"
continues the brief, "the presence in
the boxes of hundreds of ballots writ
ten by one and the same man. It is in
conceivable that any person would go
to the trouble to open 104 boxes with
out changing the relative vote in any
of them."
The recheck evidence is discredited.
It is pointed out that fifteen Supreme
Court watchers contradicted the report
of the experts regarding the placing of
ballots in the boxes without first pass
ing them through the slot.
The repeaters' testimony, it is "tated,
affected only from 150 to 225 votes, and
not a single ballot which these persons
are supposed to have voted was pro
duced.
The Peabody brief, it is understood,
will assert that the returns of more
than 100 Denver precincts and of some
outside the county have been shown to
be so permeated with fraud that they
should be rejected bodily. It will be
claimed that the evidence shows his
election by at least 3000 majority.

HALE OPPOSES
GREATER NAVY
Senator From Maine Not in
Accord With the Policy
of President Eoosevelt
MAKES IRONICAL SPEECH
Inferential Claim That the
Washington Government
Is Imitating Great Britain
WASHINGTON, Feb. 25. â In the
Senate to-day the naval appropriation
bill was taken up, and Morgan criti
cized the increased appropriation for
cruisers and colliers and requested an
explanation from Hale, in charge of
the measure.
Replying, Hale said the bill was a
moderate one so far as increases were
concerned.
"The principal object of a big navy
In time of peace." he went on, "is to
bully small powers."
He proceeded to say that this had
been the policy of England for more
than a century and that its navy had
been its instrument.
"That," he added, "must be the
policy of the powers which imitate
England." ,
"No doubt." remarked Gorman, "we
are well embarked on that policy â
not only in the character of additions
to the navy, but in its policy of taking
possession of weak neighbors as
rapidly as public sentiment will per
mit us to do so."
He said the United States had gone
beyond England in becoming guar
dians of small neighbors and collect
ing their revenues. He was prepared
to say that if this policy were con
tinued the present navy was a mere
bagatelle compared to what would be
required.
DARRACH SCORES A HIT
IN "MERCHANT OF VENICE"
Large Audience Enjoys Shakespearean
Kecital by Accomplished Reader
at Steimvay Hall.
A select audience greeted Marshall
Darrach at Stelnway Hall last even
ing in his impersonation of "The Mer
chant of Venice." From the first Mr.
Darrach held his audience with a
masterly grip. His grace of gesture,
his ease of manner, his wonderful
memory and his marvelous versatility
in the portrayal of Shylock, Gratiano
and Portia charmed every one who
heard him. Perhaps his impersona
tion of Shylock was the best, but the
whole was a series of pleasing pic
tures. The second recital will be given
Thursday afternoon nt r 30 o'clock,
when Mr. Darrach will render
"Twelfth Night." "A Midsummer
Night's Dream" will be given next
Saturday morning at 11 o'clock. These

What Sulphur Does
For the Human Body in Health
and Disease.
The mention of sulphur will recall
to many of us the early days when
our mothers and grandmothers gave
us our daily dose of sulphur and
molasses every spring- and falL
It was the universal spring and fall
"blood purifier." tonic Â«tnd cure-all,
and, mind you, this old-fashioned
remedy was not without merit.
. The idea was good, but the remedy
was crude and unpalatable and a large
quantity had to be taken to get any
effect.
Nowadays we get all the beneficial
effects of sulphur in a palatable, con-
centrated form, so that a single grain
is far more effective than a tablespoon-
ful of the crude sulphur. .
In recent years research and ex-
periment have proven that the best
sulphur for medicinal use is that ob- t
tamed from Calcium (Calcium Sul-
phide) and sold in drug stores under
the name of Stuart's Calcium Wafers.
They are small, chocolate-coated pel-
lets and contain the active medicinal
principle of sulphur in a highly con-
centrated, effective form.
Few people are aware of the value
of this form of sulphur in restoring
and maintaining bodily rigor end
health; sulphur acts directly on the
liver and excretory organs and purifies
and enriches the blood by the prompt
elimination of waste material.
Our grandmothers knew this when
they dosed us with sulphur and mo-
lasses every spring and fall, but the
crudity and impurity of ordinary
flowers of sulphur were often worse
than the disease and cannot compare
with the modern concentrated prepa-
rations of sulphur, of which Stuart's
Calcium Wafers Is undoubtedly the
â¢best and most widely used.
They are the natural antidote for
liver and kidney troubles and cure con-
stipation and purify the blood in a way
that often surprises patient and physi-
cian alike. :; ; "'
Dr. R. M. Wilkins. while experiment-
ing with sulphur remedies, soon found
that the sulphur from Calcium was
superior to any other form. He says:
"For liver, kidney and blood troubles,
especially when resulting from con-
stipation or malaria, I have been sur-
prised at the results obtained from
Stuart's Calcium Wafers. In patients
suffering from boils and pimples and
â¢even deep-seated carbuncles, I have
'repeatedly seen them dry up and dis-
appear in four or five days, leaving the
skin clear and smooth. Although
Stuart's Calcium Wafers is a proprie-
tary article and sold by druggists and
for that reason tabooed by many phy-
sicians, yet I know of nothing so safe
and reliable for constipation, liver and
kidney troubles and especially in all
forms of skin diseases as this remedy."
At any rate people who are tired of
pills, cathartics and so-called blood
"purifiers" will find in Stuart's Cal-
cium Wafers a far safer, more palat-
able and effective preparation.

FATALLY SHOT
IN W INDY CITY
Chicago Officer Wounds
Thomas K. X.van. a Sup
j>osed San Francisco Crook
CHICAGO, Feb. 25â A man who
gives his name as Thomas R. Ryan
and says he is from San Francisco was
fatally shot to-day in a revolver duel
with a Chicago policeman. Two po
licemen, named Tripp and Nape, who
live together, had just returned home
after their night's duty. They were
prepared for bed when the cry of "rob
bers" attracted their attention. They
took up the pursuit in their stocking
feet. Tripp overtook two fleeing men,
placed them under arrest and ordered
them to walk toward a patrol box.
Just before the box was reached one
of the prisoners dropped to his knees,
took deliberate aim and fired at the
officer, but did not hit him. Tripp re
turned the fire and Ryan rolled into
the gutter. Nape came to Tripp's
assistance, but the other prisoner es
caped. The alarm was first given by
Patrick Fitzpatrick, who says he was
held up by Ryan and the man who
escaped.
â¢I have never known a deserving
case of street begging. " was the re
markahje statement Sir Eric A. Bu
chanan, ser-etary of the London Men
dicity Society, made the other day.

SENATE ACTION
ON STATEHOOD
Conferees Appointed to Ef
fect an Agreement Satis
factory to Both Houses
SIOBGAN QUITS FIGHT
Permits Similar Proceed
ings for the Disposal of
the Panama Canal Bill
WASHINGTON. Feb. 25. â The Sen
ate to-day agreed to conferences on
the Joint statehood and Panama canal
bills. Morgan made no further op
position to the announcement of the
conferees on the statehood bill and,
while he declined to serve in the
Panama canal conference, he did not
-eek to postpone action.
The chair announced the appoint
ment of Kittredge, Millard and Mor
gan as conferees on the canal bill.
Morgan promptly declined, saying
that his advocacy of the House pro
vision regarding the canal commis
sion was such that he could not un
dertake to represent the position of
the Senate. He was excused and Gor
man appointed in his stead.
The statehood bill being laid be
fore the Senate, Morgan said:
"Yesterday I took the floor at an
embarrassing time and under what
were to me embarrassing circum
stances. I had supposed that those
who opposed the House bill were to
continue their opposition at this time,
but I had not been long speaking
when I found myself in semi-antag
onism to my friends. I had expressed
my views on the constitutional fea
tures of the bill when It was before
the Senate, but had not had any op
portunity to discuss its suffrage fea
tures. I was anxious to express my
views on that point and having done
so I shall not proceed further."
Morgan had scarcely ceased speak
ing when the chair made his an
nouncement of conferees on the state
hood bill, designating Beveridge, Kel
son and Bate.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1905.
TOLLEMACHE'S
RENOWN RESTS
UPON SILENCE
HENRY TOLLEMACHE. TWENTT
FOLR YEARS IN THE BRITISH
PARLIAMENT AND NEVER
MADE A SPEECH.
n British Com
mons Twenty
four Years.
LONDON, Feb. 25. â Henry Tolle
mache has represented a Cheshire dis
trict in Parliament for twenty-four
years and during that entire period
has never made a speech. He proudly
announced that fact to his admiring
constituency the other day and awoke
next morning to find himself famous.
Newspapers all over the country com
mented on his unique record; profes
sional humorists wrote funny squibs
about him and illustrated journals
printed pictures of him. As a result
he is far better known now than many
members of the House of Commons
who have sought to obtain distinction
by means of eloquence and have sel
dom missed a chance of saying some
thing.
He is fifty-nine years old and has
announced that as long as he remains
in Parliament he will continue to keep
his mouth tight closed. He is an Ox
ford B. A., so that it may be assumed
it is not because he is lacking in the
ability of the average legislator that
he has chosen to play a silent part
among the representatives of partisan
wisdom.
Tollemache is a good looking chap
with the serene, unruffled countenance
natural to the man who has won the
approval of his own conscience by
sternly resisting all temptations to add
to the verbosity of what has been
derisively dubbed the "Nation's Talk
ing Shop." It is understood that when
he retires from public life his grate
ful constituents intend to present him
with a loving cup made of the yellow
metal and inscribed with the words,
â¢'Speech is silver; silence is golden."
The greatest talker in Parliament is
the Prime Minister. There are only
half a dozen other members of the
Ho-use who have talked half as much
as Balfour, and yet he complains bit
terly that the nation's time is wasted
by needless oratory. Last session his
speeches filled 317 columns of Hansard,
which here corresponds to the Congres
sional Record, and yet his opponents
declare he has not yet made it clear
where he stands on the fiscal question.
Austen Chamberlain, Joseph Chamber
lain's promising son, came next to him
with 237 columns. Sir Henry Camp
bell-Bannerman, the leader of the op
ponents, was third with 200 columns.
The Irish members, whose loquacity
used to be so conspicuous, do com
paratively little speechifying nowa
days. John Redmond, their leader,
was content to add only 109 columns
to the debates.
There is only half as much talking
in the Lords as in the Commons.

OBJECTS TO THE KAISER'S
VAST NAVAL PROGRAMME
German Socialist Leader Protests in
Reichstag Against Enormous Ap-
propriations and Asks Why.
BERLIN, Feb. 25.â 1n the Reichstag
to-day during the discussion of the
naval appropriations, Herr Bebel, the
Socialist leader, said that if Germany
accepted the naval league's guidance
she would, it was estimated, spend
$781,250,000 on additions to the fleet.
Germany, he added, had better aim at
the future of her people and the amel
ioration of social conditions rather
than waste the proceeds of labor on
useless armaments.
"Against whom are these immense
naval preparations directed?" asked
Herr Bebel. "England? We can never
compete with England on the sea. We
have not the money nor is such rivalry
essential to our security. Sea power
is necessary to England, but not to us.
"France? The superiority of our land
forces is a sufficient guarantee of our
safety.
'Russia? She will require decades to
recuperate.
"North America? War with n?r is
unthinkable."
KING OF SAXONY SPEAKS
KINDLY OF DIVORCED WIFE

His Agent, With Having Acted
With Too Much Severity.
LEIPSIC, Saxony, Feb. 25.â King
Frederick of Saxony received Dr.
Koerner, on the latter's return from
Florence, with considerable asperity.
The Neuste Nachrichten says he re
proached him with the severity of the
measures taken toward the Countess
Montignoso (the divorced wife of King
Frederick).
"After all," said the King, "she is
the mother of the King of Saxony's
children."
Dr. Koerner left the palace much an
noyed and immediately sent in his
resignation of his place at court,
which probably will be accepted.
GUESTS ENJOY
A GALA WEEK
AT CORONADO
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HOTEL DEL CORONADO, Feb. 25.
Already preparations are being made
for increased crowds of summer visit
ors and the midwinter sojourners re
gard these with no little wonder, when
they think that the same place that
affords them pleasant refuge from the
discomforts of the winter months will
soon be sought by those fleeing from
the equally disagreeable heat of the
Northern and Eastern cities.
The ball given at the hotel on last
Saturday night was a most successful
affair from every point of view and
few of the visitors from abroad failed
to put in an appearance. The array
of pretty girls and handsome women,
exquisitely costumed and wearing rare
jewels, was a grand one indeed. The
men were out in force too, including
many army and navy officers resplend
ent in their uniforms.
On Sunday the travel to the beach
was very heavy. During the concert
hour there were few vacant chairs,
tempting as was the beach. Miss
He-over's singing and Mr. Seebold's
flute playing were especially fine feat
ures of an always enjoyable affair.
Bishop Johnson held confirmation
services at Christ Church in the morn
ing and afterward there was a musi
cal entertainment untfer the auspices
of the parish guild. Saturday evening
the Bishop, with the Rev. Dr. C. E.
Spalding and Captain Charles T. Hinde,
were entertained by the officers of the'
flagship Chicago.
The midweek hop, dances and nu
merous dinner parties, at which the
officers of the visiting men of war, as
well as those of the army, figured
largely, both as guests and entertain
ers; the concerts, racing, golfing, wa
ter polo and swimming matches in the
Hotel del Coronado pool, to say noth
ing of the unsurpassed surf bathing,
filled up the time, day and night.
The plans for outdoor pleasures for
"Washington's birthday were inter
fered with by rain, but Indoors en
joyment held full sway. The swim
ming pool, Casino and game rooms
were filled all day and in the evening

BERLIN, Feb. 25.â American
delegates to the consecration of the
Evangelical Lutheran Cathedral next
Mondayâ Professor Francis Brown of
Union Theological Seminary; the Rev. '
J- 1. Heischmann, pastor of St. Peter's
12 vs.net lical Lutheran German Church
of Brooklyn, and the Rev. J. H. Pugh,
pastor of the Grace Reformed j Church '
of Pittsburgâ here to-day. As
the guests of Emperor William, they
are lodged in apartments reserved for
them by the court marshal. The Em
peror has taken rooms at all the prin
cipal hotels for the , delegates of the j
Protestant churches of Great Britain,
Norway and Sweden, Denmark and !
Switzerland and for visiting members '
of. royal families. . Prince Arthur of !
Connaught and Crown Prince Frederick ''
of Denmark arrived to-day, besides nu- â 
merous sovereigns of German states. '
The Emperor's invitations to the
churches of all Protestantism to take
part in the dedication Is in fulfillment
of his decision to make this cathedral
a relation to Protestants such as St.
Peter's at Rome is to Roman
Catholic*
Reference has often been made to I
the purpose ox the Emperor Fred
erick and the Empress, under whose
snort reign the initial steps were taken .
to build the cathedral, to make It the i
"Westminster Abbey of Germany, and
do it Id. to be.
"We are not building a church for â¢
the province of Brandenburg." said j
the Emperor to the architect. Prof
â¢or J. C. RaschdorS, "nor for
Prussia, but a cathedral for the
Protestants of the world."
The cathedral will be open day and
sight. Some of the Protestant clergy I
of Germany have expressed discontent
at this order, as leaning toward Rome.
but quite opposite appears to be the ;
Emperor's view.
Professor RaschdortT -visited all the !
principal cathedrals of Europe before
finishing his design, which corre
sponds more nearly to the early Italian
Renaissance as shown in Austrian
churches. The organ, which Is the
largest in the world except that at I

North Sea Commission's De
cision Eegarded as in the
Nature of a Compromise
FLEET NOT ATTACKED
Supposed Torpedo - Boats
Were Myths, but Admiral
Had Eight to Be Cautious
PARIS, Feb. 25. â A decision In the
controversy between Great Britain and
Russia arising from the firing on the
Gamecock fishing fleet on the night of 1
' October 21-22 by the Russian second j
Pacific squadron, commanded by Vice
Admiral Rojestvensky, was officially
announced to-day by the interna
tional commission of inquiry.
Rear Admiral Charles H. Davis, the
American representative en the com
mission, Is of the opinion that the gen- j
eral results of the commission are fa- '
vorable to Great Britain, as they sus
tain the statement of fact as pre
sented by that country.
The general impression among those
who heard Admiral Fournier, the presi- j
ident of the commission, read the dccl- :
slon was that it was a compromise,
Great Britain's contention that there
was no torpedo-boat In the vicinity
and that Rojestvensky was not Justi
fied in firing, having been approved,
and that of Russia that Rojestvensky
acted according to his belief, even
though mistaken, and that his action
did not reflect upon his military valor
or sentiments of humanity, likewise
having been agreed to.
FINDING 6F THE COMMISSION.
slon of the commission to-day.
The commission Is of the opinion
that the delay of the Russian trans- ]
port Kamchatka, following the break
ing down of her machinery, was per
haps the cause of the incident The
commander of the Kamchatka signaled
to Admiral Rojestvensky during the .
evening that he had been attacked by !
torpedo-boats. The admiral there- j
fore had reason to believe he was at
tacked and gave orders for strict vlg- â 
llance against the possible approach
of torpedo-boats. The majority of the â 
commission considers that Admiral
Rojestvensky's orders were not ex
cessive in time of war, particularly
under the circumstances, and that he j
had every reason to consider the sit- 'â 
uation very alarming.
"The commission," the decision
says, "recognizes unanimously that
the fishing fleet committed no hostile ;
act and, the majority of the commis- i
sioners being of the opinion that there
were not, either among the fishing
boats or in their vicinity, any torpedo- ;
boats, the opening of fire by Admiral ,
Rojestvensky was not Justified."
EXONERATES ROJESTVENSKY.
The decision further says the Rus
sian commissioner did not share in the
latter opinion.
"In any event," the decision oontin- j
uea, " the commissioners are glad to
recognize unanimously that Admiral
Rojestvensky personally did all he ,
could, from the commencement to the |
end, to prevent the trawlers being the â 
object of fire by the Russian squad- j
ron."
Concerning the squadron's proceed
ing without assisting the -damaged
trawlera, the decision says:
"The commissioners are unanimous, 1
under the circumstances preceding and !
following the Incident, that there was ;
such uncertainty concerning the dan- J
ger to the Equadron as to warrant Ad- j
mlral Rojestvensky in continuing on |
his route. However, the majority jÂ«- j
grets that the admiral did not In- j
form the neighboring maritime powers j
of what had occurred."
The decision concludes as follows:
"The commissioners declare that j
their views, as formulated, are not of 1
a nature to cast any disrespect upon
the military valor or upon the senti
ments of humanity of Admiral Rojesi
vensky and the personnel of his squad-
ron.
Other Interesting features of the de
cision are as follows:
Admiral Rojestvensky, after leaving
Reval, took the greatest precautions
to prepare his vessels to repulse a tor
pedo attack during the night, whether
sailing or at anchor. The reports of
Russian agents regarding various tor
pedo-boat attacks seemed to Justify
these.
ALARMED BY ROCKETS.
The direction the Russian squadron
followed was calculated to bring the
last two divisions, as events proved, in
proximity of the customary fishing
ground of the Hull trawlers, number
ing about thirty and spreading over
several miles. The evidence of British
witnesses proved that the trawlers car
ried regulation lights, followed tha
usual fishing rules and were directed

The leading divisions of the squadron,
including Admiral Voelkersem's, pass
ed the trawlers unsuspectingly. Ad
miral Rojestvensky's division, the last,
noticed green flares, really a fishing
signal, which created alarm, and then
observed a vessel topping the waves.
Admiral Rojestvensky ordered his
ships to open fire, on the result of
which rests his responsibility.
Admiral Fournier, president of the
commission, rend the decision. The gen
eral impression among the audience
was that the decision was in the na
ture of a compromise, as the majority
approved the British contention that
no torpedo-boats attacked Admiral Ro
jestvensky's squadron, and that, there
fore, his opening fire was not justified;
And the majority approved the Rus
sian contention that Admiral Rojest
vensky aoted according to his belief,
even though mistaken, and therefore
his action did not reflect upon his mil
itary valor or sentiments of humanity.
Admiral Davis to-night said the gen
eral results of the findings were favor
able to Great Britain, since they sus
tained the statement of facts as pre
sented by Great Britain. As evidence
of this. Admiral Davis said that in tha
first place the commission found that
Admiral Rojestvensky was respons
ible for the incident and its conse
quences, and In the second place the
commission found that there were no
hostile vessels among the fishing fleet
or anywhere in that vicinity.
SCORES KILLED OR WOUNDED.
Mussulmans and Armenians Continue
Fighting In Baku.
TTFLJS, Caucasus, Feb. 25.â Details
of the recent street fighting at Baku
show that thirty-five persons were
killed or wounded on February 20, and
: that on the following day the racial
bitterness between the Mussulmans
and Armenians reached a climax.
Street murders were incessant and
; fighting lasted all day.
Altogether 100 persons were killed or
> wounded. Shops were plundered and
the garrison was Inadequate. Reinforce
; ments of five battalions of infantry,
' with artillery, and two squadrons of
I Cossacks had to be called in, and
! used their arms to suppress the out
break.
Further disturbances occurred Feb
ruary 22. The residences of the
wealthiest inhabitants were plundered
and burned. The Governor traversed
all quarters of the city exhorting the
people to cease hostilities and the Ar
menian and the Mussulman clergy
met and embraced in public and ex
pressed a desire for a reconciliation
of their peoples. The rioting was
thereupon suspended, but broke out
again on February 24.

CANAL IS PRIDE
OF GRIDLEYITES
Butte County Irrigation
Ditch Is Discussed at a
Banquet in Pretty Town
Special Dispatch to The Call.
GRIDLBY, Feb. 25. â Andrea Sbar
boro and Rufus P. Jennings of the Cal
ifornia Promotion Committee were
guests of honor to-night at a banquet
given by the citizens of Butte County
under the auspices of the Gridiey Board
of Trade to signalize the opening of
the Butte County canal. Covers were
spread for 250 at the Pacific Hotel. W.
D. Burleson, president of the Gridiey
Board of Trade, acted as toastmaster.
In addressing the banqueters Sbar
boro said he had never in a forty-mile
drive seen so much fertile land as he
had to-day. The country was very
sparsely settled, he said, and he felt
that the opening of the great canal
would induce a population to engage in
diversified farming. San Francisco pays
millions of dollars for vegetables every
year. These can be raised around
Gridley. The merchants of San Fran
cisco, said Sbarboro, realize that the
interior of the State needs population
to develop its resources, and that is
why the California Promotion Commit
tee is bringing a desirable class of peo
ple to the State.
Jennings declared that J. B. Lippln
cott of the United States Geological
Survey considered the Sacramento Val
ley offered the greatest possibilities
for Irrigation of any section in the
United States. Edward P. Antron
made a hit in telling why Butte Coun
ty under Irrigation offers unusual op
portunities to the Eastern farmer. W.
A. Beard spoke on the Sacramento
Valley. Willard M. Sheldon of the San
Francisco Savings Union spoke of the
building of the canal.
The San Francisco delegation of
twenty arrived In Marysville last night.
To-day they drove forty miles along
the line of the canal. Owing to recent
rains some final work on the canal has
been delayed. Three weeks' work will
put the canal in shape to run water on
the fields.
The Butte County canal is fifteen
miles long, sixty feet wide on the top
and forty feet wide on the bottom,
carrying water to a depth of four feet.
It has been built within a year at a
cost of $150,000. It has a fall of two
inches to the mile. It will irrigate 140,
000 acres of land. The water is taken
out of the Feather River at Hamilton
Landing.
Visitors from San Francisco and
Sacramento were delighted with the
appearance of the valley, which Is
green with recent rains. Orange trees
in bearing, acres of almonds in blossom
and vigorous orchards of fruita testify
to the fertility of the soil. Several
great ranches that have been held In
tact for years are now being broken up
for intending settlers.
BISPHAM SINGS WAGNER
WITH SPLENDID SUCCESS
Distinguished Barytone Delights His
Audience and Will Appear Here
Again Xext Sunday.
The breadth and depth of David
Bispham's art were finely demon
strated yesterday afternoon at the Al
hambra. The great barytone's pro
gramme showed his versatility In a
noteworthy degree, even if it omitted
the names of some classics whose
compositions he is wont to sing with
distinction. Barring a slight cold, the
soloist was in capital voice, and his
songs ranged from grave to gay and
from the pensive tenderness of Schu
mann's "Dichterliebe" to the diabol
ism of lago's "Credo" out of Verdi's
"Otello."
The Schumann lyrics came first, fol
lowed by Schubert's "I>er Linden
baum" and "Die Post" â all full of
warmth and color and sung with ex
quisite delicacy and sympathy.
Brahms' "Wie Froh und Frisch" was
less satisfying.
The greatest promise of the after
noon was offered by the dramatic se
lections â the Amfortas Lament
from "Parsifal," and the lago so
liloquy â and promises were kept.
Wagner's magnificently solemn tone
poem was rendered with a stress of
power and feeling that went far to
compensate for the lack of operatic

Human hair

The hair of the head has
always been a source of
pride to both men and

or deterioration is a source
of keen mortification
and regret.
. From time to time
van so-called remedies

various ' diseases of the
scalp have been foisted upon
the public, and thÂ£ failure
of these to do any perma-

SCHOOL CHANGE
Mission Improvement Feder
ation Says Little Children
Are Forced to Walk Far
The Mission Improvement Federa
tion, consisting of delegates of the va
rious Improvement clubs throughout
the Mission, met last night and took
under consideration many topics bear
ing on the affairs of the Mission and
added protests against certain actions
of the city officials.
Indignation was expressed over the
change of the James Lick School into a
grammar school and of the Noe Valley
School into a primary school, causing
children to walk four extra blocks. The
members seemed to think that the
change was made to enable the princi
pal of the James Lick School to draw a
higher salary as a grammer principal.
Senate bill No. 310, which is about to
be amended by the insertion of the fol
lowing section, was condemned and the
secretary was instructed to forward a
protest to Sacramento. The amended
section reads:
Section 8. That plans and specifi
cations for all new buildings and addi
tions to old buildings costing in the
aggregate more than two thousand
(2000) dollars, in cities of fifteen
thousand (15,000) or more inhabi
tants, and in cities where the ordi
nances require that plans and specifi
cations shall be approved by the city
authorities, shall be made by a
licensed architect holding a certificate
to practice architecture in this State,
and that the plans and specifications
shall be stamped with the seal of such
certificated architect."
Attention was drawn to the appro
priation of $5000 for the improving
of the San Bruno road, from Army
street to the county line. Out of this
sum $924 has already been taken for
the purpose stated.
The federation claims that no work
or one single load of macadem has
been spread on the road since the
first day of last July, and Is anxious
to know where the $924 went. Not
withstanding the appropriation, the
roadway is in a deplorable condition
and in need of repairs.

o'clock.
A meeting of all the ushers and as
sistants for Oakland will be held to
morrow at 3 p. m. in the Eighth-ave
nue Methodist Church, where they will
receive final instruction from Dr. Wal
ton. Owing to the change in the plans
for the campaign, it has been impos

ing.
On Tuesday there will be choir re
hearsals in each of the four districts.
The West Oakland district, at the
Chester-street Methodist Church; the
West Central district, at Hamilton

AND CHILDREN
MRS. GEORGIE PAGE. VvHO HAS
DISAPPEARED AND MAY HAVE
COMMITTED SUICIDE. {
Mrs. Robert Page
Mysteriously
Disappears.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 25. â After kissing
her 6-year-old son an affectionate
farewell and telling the little fellow
that he would never see her more,
Mrs. Georgie Page, wife of Robert
Page of 2232 Pacific avenue, left her
home yesterday morning at 8:30
o'clock and her present whereabouts
is unknown. Mrs. F. M. Sprague,
mother of the missing woman, is fear
ful that she has done away with her
self and to-day enlisted the assistance
of the police in a search* for her
daughter.
Mrs. Page is a brunette, above the
average height and of slight build.
She is 35 years of age and was attired
when she left home in a black dress,
a military cape of the same color and
a dark hat, ornamented with two
birds. She is the mother of four chil
dren, the eldest being 13 and the
youngest 2 years old. According to
Mrs. Sprague, the domestic life of Mrs.
Page was happy and why the young
wife should desert her husband and
liitln ones is ;i mystery to her mother.
It is thought by some of the friends
of Mrs. Page that she may have wan
dered away while temporarily de
ranged, :is her actions of late caused
some of her acquaintances to think
that she was becoming mentally un
balanced. Robert Page, husband of
the missing woman, is employed by a
San Francisco elevator firm.

THINKS HE MAY
NOT TAKE FOOD
Forced by Illness to Stop
Work Bridge Builder Says
He Is Not Entitled to Eat
IS STAEVING TO DEATH
Moistens His Lips With Wa
ter From a Little Bottle
and Is Almost a Skeleton
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 25.
With the one idea fixed in his mind
that unless he works he should not
eat, George W. Jones, for many years
in the employ of the San Francisco
Eridge Company, has so starved him
self as to reduce his weight from 150
pounds to 110. He was brought into
court on the petition of his wife to
day and was committed to the insane
asylum at Stockton. He had with him
a small perfume bottle filled with wa
ter, with which he moistens his lips,
but he told Judge Ogden that further
than this he was not entitled to nour
ishment.
Jones lived at 518 Tenth street and
had held a responsible position with
his firm, which sent him to the Phil
ippines, the Hawaiian Islands, Central
America and other countries to erect
the structures manufactured by the
firm. He was injured some years ago
and the doctors believe that some
pressure is bearing on the brain as a
result and has caused his hallucina
tion. Three months ago he returned
from Humboldt County, with his mind
so muddled that he could not settle
up his affairs with the company and
had to stop work. Then the idea that
he was not entitled to eat took pos
session of him and he iias been grad
ually starving himself to death. For
the last thirty-six hours at the Receiv
ing Hospital he would eat nothing, but
was made to drirrk a pint of milk
three times a day.
JEFFRESS MUST
FACE A TRIAL
Former Manager for Crane
Company Will Have to An
swer Embezzlement Charge
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 25.
Because the evidence seems to show
that he had failed to account for $100
which he had collected George H. Jef
frcss, formerly local manager of the
Crp.ne Supply Company of Chicago,
was held to answer to-day on a charge
of felony embezzlement, and he must
now face trial in the Superior Court.
His preliminary examination was held
this morning before Judge Samuels in
Department 2 cf the Police Court, and
Jeffress 1 bonds were placed at $5000.
H. M. Hardeman, the present man
ager of the Crane Company in Oakland
and San Francisco, testified that Jef
l'ress had coilected $200 from H. T.
Maddern of this city and had only ac
counted for half the amount. Harde
man said that when Jeffress was ar
rested he said: "I intended to send that
$100 over to-morrow. â '
The questions of the attorneys for
the defense Indicate that Jeffress will
try to prove he- was authorized to make
rebates, which were not to appear upon
the books, and that the $100 was simply
held by him to cover these rebates.
Jeffress will make the claim that he
was authorized to do whatever was
necessary 'to meet trade conditions in
Oakland, and that he acted strictly
within his rights in retaining the
money.
Deputy District Attorney Harris con
ducted the prosecution and Attorneys
Fitzgerald and McDonald appeared for
the defense.

cated there and is said to be in Dcs
Moines. Caton died after what ap
peared to be an attack of biliousness
that lasted but three days.

Bequeaths $38,000
to Charity.
The will of Henry Horstmann, who
I died last Monday at his residence,

day for probate. Large hearted and
generous in life, Mr. Horstmann was
no less so in his final disposition of
property. Eleven local institutions
come in for largre bequests, amounting
to $35,000, and the German Hospital
is aided with valuable real estate. The
gifts are mostly to Institutions of
charity and education and are speci
fied as follows:

San Francisco Nursery for Home
less Children, $3000.
San Francisco Polyclinic, $8000.

j 000 to be distributed according to its
provisions, no amount being leas than
$5000. To relatives and friends here
in California, including the son of his
old partner, the total amount left is
$79,000. To two faithful servants is
left $10,000. The document was filed
: yesterday by Harris & Hess, attorneys.
Christian Lehman, John L. Bach Jr.
and Joseph C. Cox are named in It as
executors.
Mr. Horstmann, who was 77 years
of age, was one of the oldest pioneers
of the German colony of San Francisco,
long identified with the city's mercan
tile and civic life. In 184& he left
Harpstedt, Hanover, where he was
born, to make his home in the new
world and seek his fortune. He landed !
at New Orleans in the same year, and I
goon after his arrival there was mar
ried. In 1849, when word reached the
East and South of the golden discov
ery in California, Mr. Horstmann left
his wife in the Crescent City and start
ed for California by way of the isthmus
of Panama.
WtMV he reached Panama he was
stricken with fever, that was preva
lent at that time, and his journey to
California was deferred until his re

NOT FOR BEST FARM
in the State.
"I saw so much in the papers about
the wonderful cures effected by Pyra-
mid Pile Cure, I determined to give it
a trial. I bought from my druggist
out Li'-ctnt box and used it as directed,
and by the time I had used the last j
'pyramid' 1 was entirely cured; in four
days after I began to use the 'pyra- j
mids' all inflammation was gone. I
was perfectly eaey all the time, the ;
exces&ive discharge stopped at once,
and stools became easy and gentle.
i was unable to get my own fire-
wood for four months, and half the
time when I could walk at all 1 hud
to walk half bent. I used many pile
remedies, salves and ointments, all to
: no effect until I used one 50-cent box
â¢ of Pyramid Pile Cure and was cured.
"1 would not be afflicted as I was
four months ago for the best farm In
the State of Arkaneae. I can give
proof and reference of the wonderful
cure to all who are afflicted as I wag.
Please publish my letter that I may ad-
vise the afflicted."â W. E. Wallis, Pig-
got, Ark., box 26.
The experience of Mr. Wallis is that
of thousands of others who suffer for
years with the most painful forms of
hemorrhoids, or piles, and after trying
everything they hear of give up all
hope of a cure and look for temporary
relief only. To all such a little book
published by Pyramid Drug Company,

covery. In the early part of 1851 ho
arrived in San Francisco and immedi- j
ately sent for his wife.
They spent two years in Marysvllle,
where Mr. Horstmann conducted a ho
tel.
About this time he engaged in the
business of importing ready-made
houses from Swedon and Denmark for
use in San Francisco. These were
built abroad, taken apart for shipment
and then set up on arrival here. Houses
of this kind are still standing on Minna
6treet, between First and Second.
Deciding to stay in San Francisco,
he engaged in the furniture business on
Dupont street, near California, but suf
fered a severe reversal and total loss
of his place in one of the early fires
that swept the city. Nothing daunted,
he went into partnership with Fritz
Hufschmidt and engaged in business
opposite Portsmouth Square.
The business growing rapidly, the
firm erected a fine stone structure on
Pine street, between Montgomery and
Sansoine. and continued there until the
t-urly sixties- when the business was
removed to tne block on Market street
that is the present cite of the St. Nich
olas Hotel.
Mr. Horstmann shared in the vicissi
tudes of the early city government,
and in 1856 was a member of the Ger
man company of the vigilance commit
tee. The company was commanded by
Captain Meyerdierks, and was active
in the establishment and preservation
of order.
During his active business life Mr.
Horstmann accumulated a considera
ble fortune. He was a director of the
German Bank. During this time his
uife and one son died. He is survived
by a sister, Mrs. John Bach, and a
brother, Christopher Horstmann.

Charles F. Taylor, Charged With Ob
taining $3000 by False Pretenses,
Must Stand Trial.
CHICAGO, Feb. 25. â Judge Chet
lain to-day refused to free Charles F.
Taylor, indicted with Mrs. Alice Webb-
Duke, by the Grand Jury of Nacog
doches County on a charge of obtain
ing $300(^ under false pretenses. The
case came before Judge Chetlaln on a
writ of habeas corpus, obtained by
Taylor's attorney through representa
tions that the indictment was faulty.
The lawyer contended that four or five
counts in the indictment are not suf
ficiently clear to warrant â¢holding the
prisoner for the Texas authorities, but
the court held the indictment good.
As a reuult Taylor will probably face
trial in Texas.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. FEBRUARY 2G, 1905.
CRUISER BOSTON
AT MARE ISLAND
Reaches Navy Yard After
Cruise Cut Short by Out
break of Yellow Fever
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO, Feb. 25. â The United
States cruiser Boston steamed into the
harbor here late this afternoon and
saluted Admiral McCalla's flag. The
ship is almost direct from the west
coast of the Isthmus of Panama.
The homecoming of the Boston was
caused by the outbreak of yellow
fever on board. Surgeon Otto Kohl
hose and a Japanese messman died of
the disease. The doctor's remains
were sent to Washington, D. C, for
burial. Lieutenant W. D. Leahy and
Paymaster F. P. Sackett of the ship
were also stricken down with the
fever. They were left at Ancon. Pri
vate G. D. Lafferty of the Marine
Corps and T. Iseki, a Japanese mess
man, had the fever In a ligrrft form.
Captain Miles brought his ship to
Northern latitudes as soon as it was
prudent to do so.
Owing to their enforced long stay
in Panama waters, the health of the
officers and crew was considerably run
down, but the men grained in weight
and strength as the ship moved north.
Few stops were made en route. The
ship was quickly passed by the quar
antine officers at San Francisco and
a number of the officers and men have
already been on shore.
The crew of the cruiser will be given
several weeks' rest at the navy yard
while the vessel is receiving some
minor reoairs.

UNION SQUARE PARK CAN BE USED
AS SLEEPING PLACE BY DAY
DEFECT IN ORDINANCE
GIVES JOY TO TRAMPS
TKey^ Ma^ Z)o^^ in Sunshine
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
With the inauguration of vernal
i balmness there came intensified som
| nolence to the chronic male hftbitucs
1 of Union Square Park, and to Patrol
; man "Jim" Mah,ne> was conveyed
complaint that the sward was bein^
\ utilized as a sleeping place hy men in
; various stagos of sartorial dilapidation
and uncleanlincss of person. The com
"plainants were merchants and others
with premises fronting on the pretty
green patch. Their artistic sense was
shocked by the marring of the land
scape. They said that women and
children, because of the brightness of
their raiment, enhanced rather than
spoiled the pictorial effect, but ragg-ed
and dirty men drowsing on the lawns
â â vas akin to desecration. Besides, wo
men and children did not sprawl and
snore.
So the patrolman visited the square
last Friday afternoon, and in the glad
sunshine aroused and placed under ar
rest eight human sleepers. He found
a greater number than that, but eight
were as many as he could conveniently
handle at a time; and when lie fia<l
Jailed them and returned to scoop, in
another batch the alarm had spread
and not a slumberer could he discover.
When the dingy octets was arraigned
before Judge Mugan.an attorney moved
for dismissal of thie complaint, â  In
asmuch as the defendants had not
fractured any law. The ordinance un
der which they were arrested, he said,
made it a misdemeanor to "'sleep in a
public park over night," whereas ' the
defendants did ' their business With
Morpheus while the day orb was bright
ly blazing. He produced the ordinance
to prove his -argument, and there was
ne gainsaying the virtue of his de
mand. Dismissal was ordered, and the
Judge declared intention to lay the de
fect before the Board of Supervisors
and request them to remedy it as soon
ap possible, so that Patrolman Ma
loney may prevent Union Square being
used as a free daylight lodging place
while the summer is on.
Rumor had it that after the eight
were released they hastened back to
the square and circulated the glad tid
ings among their heavy-eyed fellows,
and that quickly thereafter the green
v.as dotted with prostrate forms and
the atmosphere a-tremble with nasal
concert. Indeed, report went so far as
to say that the acquitted ones and their
brethren in vagabondage were defiant
ly impudent to their late custodian,
some of them instructing him to call
them at specified hours, while others
threatened to charge him with deliber
ately provoking a misdemeanor if he
should allow them to slumber until af
ter sundown and thus make them
amenable to arrest under the ordi-
nance.
Miss Julia Kennedy (colored) averred
that ere she pursued Miss Juanita
Green (also colored) with a knife and
pistol and intent to do bodily harm
she had been "pestered" until her
naturally amiable temper succumbed
tc the strain.
"She kern teh me, dis Wawneeter gal
did," said Miss Kennedy, "an' she ses.
sez she, 'Yo'll do me er Ah'll do yo*. an'
she pestered an' pestered till Ah Jes
hed teh go after her teh p'oteck my

Miss Kennedy was absolutely unpro
voked. "Ah'm a scittin' in mah own
house, Jedge, at 504 Broadway," Miss
Green said, "wen dis yah Juliar busts
in en goes fo' me. 'Ah ain't lukkin'
fo' no trubble,' Ah sez t'er, 'en Ah ain't
runnin* away from no trubble, nuther,'
Ah sez."
"Or, in other words," suggested his
Honor 'Cabaniss, "you Informed her
that you were standing pat."
"Mah wuds wuz teh thet effeck,"
said Miss Green.
Miss Lola Macknight, whose com
plexion inspired Clerk Conlan to in
quire if she was certain her name
wasn't "Midnight," testified for the
prosecution, as did Miss Margie Stew
art, whose white automobiling coat
was decked with crimson facings. "We
wuz all a settln* en a talkin'," Miss
Stewart affirmed, "wen dis Kennedy
puson kerns a buttin' in lak a ter
mater." It was explained by counsel
that "termater" should not be inter
preted to mean a vegetaDle, which is
inanimate, but a violent atmospheric
disturbance akin to a cyclone and
technically termed "tornado."
The defense will be given further ;
hearing next Saturday, when there is
likely to be sharp resentment of the
prosecution's frequent allusion to the
sisterly relationship borne by the de- \
fendant to one "Yellow" Kennedy, who
recently escaped conviction on the
charge of having being implicated in
the murder of Policeman George Rob
inson several years ago in the Mis
sion.
Mrs* Winifred Herbert of 1473 Oak
street believed she had a perfect right

'by rug shaking. If a housewife could
not shake her rugs without disturbing
the peace, for goodness sake what was
she to do to keep her rooms clean and
herself out of jail?
Miss Moffett said the peace disturb
ance complained of by her consisted
not so much in the rug-shaking as in
the language addressed to her, and the
mode of addressing it by Mrs. Herbert,
when the rug-shaking was protested
against. "And her boy," Miss Moffett
added, "is also a neighborhood pest."

Jeremiah Donovan, accused by his
wife of failing to provide for their in
fant cLild, convinced Judge Mogan that
the woman was more to blame than he
for the neglect of the little one. He
said that most of the money given by
him to her for household expenses was
spent for drink, and the woman ad
mitted that she imbibed rather freely,
but never to the point of intoxication.

Mrs. Mary Munya, petite and comely
of countenance, informed Judge Ca
baniss that she declined to pay John
Kirwin, hack driver, the sum of $3
because she regarded the demand as
exorbitant.
"I don't want to buy his hack," she
said, pleasantly, "and he must show
me how I owe him three dollars."
i Mr. Kirwin stated that Mrs. Munya
engaged his vehicle on Market street
last Friday evening and instructed him
' to convey her to her place of residence,
'â  1628 Page street, at the same time ex
plaining that she had no money, but
: would pay for the ride when she ar
rived at home. En route, however, she
requested him to drive her around
awhile, and he did so, until Â»he liad |
j consumed J3 worth of riding. When he j
i asked for his fare she calmly told him
j what she subsequently told the court
that she did not desire to purchase his
hack. Hence his complaint.
"Oh, sooner than have any more
trouble over his old bill I'll pay It."
said the defendant.
'That's the best thing you can do,"
! quoth his Honor. "And If you follow
: my advice you will eschew extrava- i
i gance in future by riding on street
i cars. Hacks and automobiles and
I kindred vehicular conveyances are for j

| Mogan he could present no logical rea

EVADE THE QUESTIONS
PUT BY POLICE BOARD
Heinz and O'Brien of Ellis'
Squad Placed in Bad Light
by Faltering.
The five patrolmen of the China
town squad commanded by Sergeant
Thomas P. Ellis were found guilty of
neglect of duty by the Police Commis
sion last night because they failed to
suppress fantan games. Their names
are R. R. O'Brien, Henry Heinz. Wil
liam Doran, Charles E. Munn and
Henry T. McGrath. Sentence was
postponed to Wednesday evening, at
which time Sergeant Ellis is also to
hear his fate.
The entire squad that was detailed
on October 1 to wage the campaign
against the gambling places now
stands guilty of the charges; that for
mer Commissioner Hutton preferred.
It yes this ssnie squad concerning
which the Grand Jury made such
startling revelations of corruption as
a result of the confessions to it by
Sergeant Ellis and Patrolmen Heinz
Â»nd O'Brien that they had accepted
large sums of bribe money.
But the Police Board could not get
at the corruption phase because the
secrecy of the Grand Jury room
barrefl use of the testimony gathered
there. Those who had confessed took
refuge behind the protection given by
the constitution and all that the Com
missioners could do was to establish
that the squad had been negligent in
riot making a success of their warfare
on fantan and lotteries.
The board made a vigorous attempt
to drive Heinz to a corner last night.
He was induced to go on the stand
Â«nd virtually denied that he had ac-
I b.-ibes from Chan Cheung. The
more pointed questions as to the hon
of his course in Chinatown were
ied on the plea that the answers
incriminate him. While O'Brien
did not take the stand he placed him
ln the same category with Heinz
by stating that his attitude toward
queries the Commissioners were
-ng was identical. In pronounc
udgment President Poheim an
ed that these two defendants
emaelvea much more in
by refusing to be frank.
It seems a foregone conclusion that
-â¢-ant Ellis and Heinz and O'Brien
be dismissed from the depart-
ment. It is possible that Munn, Mc-
Grath and O'Brien will get off with
heavy fines. The outcome of Chief
Wittman's case, the trial of which be
gins to-morrow night, will probably
have an important bearing.
TRIAL RESUMED.
The trial was resumed with the in
troduction of the police records show-
Ing the arrests that the defendants
made during November of Chinese
captured in raids. These reports in
dicated a fair amount of activity on
the part of the squad.
But Commissioner Reagan was led
tc exclaim that the records proved that
"Sergeant Kills' s>iuad never captured
more than seven. Chinese in one raid."
According to the Grand Jury's report,
these raids were prearranged, in order
to make a showing, and the Chinamen
were selected beforehand who should
rubmil to arrest and be subjected to
the snia.ll fines the Police Judges im
posed.
Dcran explained that the squad never
broke into locked drawers found in the
fantan rcoms because of the fear of
exceeding authority. Drinkhouse sug
gested that no law would be trans
gressed more in chopping down the
doois, as the squad did frequently, ac
csrding to the witness, than in bursting
cpen drawers in which money and
gambling paraphernalia might be con
cealed on the appearance of the police
men.
Jt was apparent that the Commis
sioner regarded the failure of the
pouad to "break open the drawers as a
s-Jbterfuge in fake raids.
CBmmij*sioner Reagan doesn't think
, nWJch of the testimony of the squad
members that they "chopped down
doors so energetically." "You can't
find ax marks on more than four doors
in all Chinatown," he says.
VISITED (HAN CHEUNG.
"Do you know, a Chinaman named
Chan Cheung?" queried Drinkhouse of
Doran.
"1 have heard of him."
"Did you ever visit him at No. 2 St.
Louis alley?:'.; â¢
"Yes, I. have been in that place try
ing to stop a game being conducted
thÂ°re."
"Did you ever raid his place?"
According to the confession of Ser
geant Ellis to the Grand Jury, the pa
trolmen of the squad, among them the
three defendants, called xon Chan
Cheung, every week for a protection
payment of $40 each.
"Isn't it a fact that you visited
Chan Cheung every Saturday?" con
tinued the Commissioner.'
"I never did."
"Didn't you so testify before the
Grand Jury?"
"I don't think I did."
"Would like an answer either yes
or no," commanded Drinkhouse
"No, I ; did not." .
"How is it that In the raids by the
squad not more than eight Chinamen
were ever, caught, while in former
Commissioner Hutton's raid . over
eighty were captured ?"
"Because Hutton and Lawyer Car
penter gathered up all the bums they
could find and started up a fake game
M they could make their raid good."
. Commissioner ; Drinkhouse' pricked
this sensational statement"' by declar
ing that he participated in * a raid in
*hicn sixty Chinese were found about
1 riJU J&mmp-
the fantan tables in one room. "I am
sure I did not gather up any bums
and send them inside," added the
Commissioner, evidently regarding
Doran's assertion as absurd.
McGRATH QUESTIONED.
Henry T. McGrath was the second
of the trio of defendants to take the
stand. Almost every day, he said, he
and the other members of the squad
chopped down doors and raided gam
bling dens.
"Did you ever visit Chan Cheung
on Saturdays at Xo. 2 St Louis alley?"
demanded Drinkhouse in ugly voice.
But the witness explained that he
never went '"upstairs" where the
Grand Jury says the "statesmen" dis
pensed the corruption fund.
"Did Chief of Police Wittman ever
visit the squad in Chinatown?"
"I saw him occasionally."
"Did he ever make a tour of Chi
natown to familiarize himself with the
location of the games?"
I think I saw him so engaged one
night. I am not sure about it"
"What did Sergeant Ellis tell you at
the Grand Jury investigation?"
"He told me he had made a clean
breast of everything and urged me to
tell everything I knew about corrup
tion in Chinatown. I told him it
looked to me as if he had told the
Grand Jury that I took money and
that heNvas a liar. I asked him if he
had told the jury that he had received
bribes, and he said 'no.' "
Policeman Charles E. Munn, the
third of the defendants, testified in de
tail as to the campaign he participated
in against fantan and lotteries.
MIXX ON* THE STAND.
"Was Sergeant Ellis in the Grand
Jury room when you testified before
that body?"
"No, sir."
"Did Sergeant Ellis say anything to
you at the Grand Jury rooms?"
"Yes; he urged me in the anteroom
to make a clean breast of everything.
He said the jurors knew all and that
I would better tell. He did not know,
he explained, how the jury got the in
formation."
"What did Ellis mean by telling you
to "make a clean breast of every
thing?' "
"1 suppose he meant that I should
make confession if I had accepted any
bribes in Chinatown."
"Could Ellis have protected the
frames without your knowing anything
about it?"
"Yes, he might, for example, have
given warning to the gamblers of con
templated raids."
"How was it that never more than
MVcn or eijrht Chinamen were taken in
a raid when the rooms had been occu
pied by many more?"
"I never could understand that my
self."
This closed the case of Patrolmen
Doran, Munn and McGrath, and the
trial of Policemen Henry Heinz and R.
R. O'Brien, the other members of Ellis'
squad, was at once begun. They are
the two patrolmen who confessed be
fore the Grand Jury that they were
paid $40 a week each by Chan Cheung
at No. 2 St. Louis alley as bribe money.
By stipulation the testimony taken
in the preceding trial was made to ap
ply to Heinz and O'Brien. Thoy en
tered formal pleas of not guilty to the
complaints id to them.
HEINZ TESTIFIES.
The T'ommissioners first called Heinz
to testify.
"DM you over see Sergeant Ellis go
into No. 2 St. Louis alley?"
"I never did."
"Did Policeman O'Brien ever tell you
h* accepted money from Chan Che
ung?"
"He never did."
"1 ..â¢<> you know Chan Cheung?"
"I know several Chan Cheungs. But
the one who resides at No. 2 St. Louis
alley I have met a number of times
just to say how-do-you-do to him."
"Did you call on him every week?"
"Sometimes two or three times a
week I would visit his place."
"Did you ever accept anything in
Chinatown besides tea and cigars?"
Asher here asserted the constitu
tional right ef his client not be required
to incriminate himself. Commissioner
Reagan wanted to ask the witness if he
was ever offered any more substantial
presents, but the attorney would not
permit an answer.
Heinz said that the night Ellis and
he were before the Grand Jury the ser
geant was under the influence of li
quor.
Then Drinkhouse propounded the fol
lowing pointed query:
"Do you think if you had done your
duty honestly you would be declining
to answe/ any questions here to
night?"
Asher protested vehemently. "All
right," said Reagan, "We don't need
any answer." Drinkhouse chimed in
with the statement, "We don't want
any answer." It was evident the Com
missioners had their minds made up.
TWO CASES CLOSED.
At this point the cases of Heinz and
O'Brien were closed, after a stipula
tion was entered Into that all the tes
timony taken against and for the
squad should cover' their cases.
Attorney Asher argued briefly that
Sergeant Ellis' squad had not failed
in greater degree than any other squad
in suppressing games. They had done
their best, as was evidenced by the
raiding they carried on, and had not
been guilty of neglect of duty, be con

YOUNGER DAUGHTER OF MR. AND MKS. JOHN D. SPRECKELS, WHO LAST â¢ NIGHT BECAME THE BRIDE OF A SAN
FRANCISCO MAN WELL KNOWN IN CLUB AND COMMERCIAL LIFE. THE CEREMONY BEING PERFORMED AT
THE HOME OF THE BRIDES PARENTS BY THE REV. DR. GEORGE C. ADAMS.
"FRAU KOENIGIN" IS GIVEN
SUCCESSFULLY AT ALHAMBRA
Miss Grace Llewellyn Jones and Dr.
J. K. Plincz Win Plaudits From
liartfe Audience.
A German play in the hands of
Americans â and amateurs at that â
doesn't so-und promising? But the hun
dreds of Germans (and those others
who know their German) who heard
"Frau Koenigin" at the Alhambra last
night, pronounced it a complete suc
cess.
The leading feminine role was in the
hands of Miss Grace Llewellyn Jones,
who carried off honors last spring in
the French play "Phedre," given at
Berkeley. The leading male role was
taken by Dr. Johannes Karl Plincz.
In it the subtlety and superb cunning
of Gabriel yon Rosenworth was dex
terously given. So toj was the
cajoled husband, Ulrich yon Hohen
twyl, taken by Carl Meier, who had
a fast and furious time keeping tab
upon his foolish little wife, whose head
had been turned by the assiduous love
making of gay Gabriel.
The comedy is full of sparkle and
snap and not a phase of its humor
seemed to be lost upon the house, most
of which was on good terms with the
Teutonic tongue. Artistically the per
formance was success, bearing in
mind that the rendition was amateur.
And financially it bore good fruit, the
funds to be used to purchase books for
the German library at the University
of California.
nesses for the prosecution was at
tacked.
The Commissioners retired to delib
erate on their verdict and they arrived
at it very quickly.
Heinz and O'Brien were found guilty
unanimously. Doran, Munn and Mc-
Grath were pronounced guilty by the
votes of Commissioners Reagan and
Drinkhouse. President Poheim voted
not guilty, explaining that he did not re
gard the evidence as sufficient and gave
the defendants the benefit of his doubt.
The president added that O'Brien and
Heinz had placed themselves in a bad
light by refusing to answer any and all
questions.
Sentence of the five policemen was
postponed to Wednesday evening on
motion of Reagan.
As the bells of the hall clock chimed
the hour of 5* last night Miss Lily
Hpreckcls, younger daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. John D. Spreckels, became the
bride of Harry Holbrook, the well
known clubman. The ceremony took
place at the Spreckels home on Pacific
avenue at Lagruna street.
Under the dome of the handsome
reception hail a dais had been raised,
flanked on either side by gigantic
bunches of Bermuda lilies, rising from
great vases cf bronze. For a back
ground seven tall candelabra of gold
upheld similar masses of the lily from
the tropic seas, flanked by a tangle of
ferns and palms. But the dominating
note of the great hall in its nuptial
ureas was a splendid date palm, whose
graceful fronds fell from the gallery
above, touching the tips of the lilies
in their golden cups.
It was upon this dais that the bride
and groom plighted their troth, the
solemn service being read by the Rev.
Dr. George C. Adams in the presence
of over 400 friends, who were scattered
about in the galleries and the adjoin
ing apartments.
Alone the bride descended the stairs,
meeting her father near the conserva
tory, and, passing through the Moor
ish room, took her place with her honor
maid, Mien Grace Spreckels. Here they
were joined by Mr. Holbrook and his
best man, John Sroufe Merrill.
Here, after the ceremony, in .the soft
ened shade from the Jeweled lights
above, the happy pair remained to re
ceive their guests.
Supper was served in the. ballroom
below, which looked not unlike a wild
wood glen, vith its. masses of ever
greens, palms and woodwardia. At the
bride's table were seated thirty-six
guests. Overhead hung an effective
centerpiece of woodwardia, half con
cealing, half revealing a shoAver of mel
low light. Azaleas, sweet from the rug
ged canyons of Tamalpais, graced the
table, nestling in masses of maiden
hair. Pink carnations, with bands of
pink ribbon, bore out the decorative
scheme. The other tables scattered
throughout the room bore pink carna
tions, fruit blossoms being used spar
ingly to defeat the â  suggestion of
monotony.
In the drawing-rooms and Moorish
room American |Jeauty rones were
massed in bronze vases, mingling their

Contest for Vacancy Narrows Down to
Two Candidates, One or Whom
Will B e Chosen.
A rumor was current around the.
City Hall yesterday that either Her
bert Schmitz or Alexander O'Grady
would be appointed Police Commis
sioner to succeed Hutton. Schmitz,
who recently resigned as Commission
er of Works, is not particularly anx
ious to be Police Commissioner, but
some of his friends are urging upon
him to accept the post. In the event
that Schmitz refuses the post then
O'Grady, it is said, will be named to
fill the vacancy. The original pro
gramme for Schmitz to take his old
position as secretary of the Park
Commission, from which James de
Succa was to retire to become store
keeper of the Board of Education,
would then in all likelihood be car
ried out. The rum'- also coupled the
name of Detective Sergeant Jerry Di

Chief of Police to succeed Wittman.

for the place.

HONOR MEMORY
OF EDUCATOR
Many Mourn Loss of Miss
Kate Elliott, Who Died at
San Diego on February 14
PAY ELOQUENT TRIBUTE
Associates of Woman Who
Had Taught for 30 Years
Speak of Work She Did
Impressive exercises were held at
the Girls' High School last Tuesday
in memory of Miss Kate Elliott, the
veteran school teacher, who died in
San Diego on February 14. Dr. Scott,
principal of the high school, opened
the meeting by saying that he thought
the death of Miss Elliott should be no
ticed officially; that due respect
should be paid to the memory of a
woman who had taught so faithfully
and successfully, and that it seemed
pathetic that she could not have lived
to enjoy her well earned rest, as she
had taught for thirty years and was
pensioned January 3 after her res
ignation from her post. He said that
she had performed her duties as in
structor during the last term under
great stress, ac her health was fail
ing, but notwithstanding she did her
whole duty to the last moment.
Following Dr. Scott the teachers
were called upon to make remarks,
but their profound grief kept most of
them silent. Those who spoke did so
with great difficulty. Miss Fidelia
Jewett spoke of the nobility of Miss
Elliott's character, of the unusual
number of strong friends she had, and
of Miss Elliott herself as one of the
truest friends that any one ever had.
HER GOOD DEEDS.
Mrs. Mary Prag gave a sketch of
Miss Elliott's work. When she entered
it, twenty-eight years ago, Joseph
Clement, president of the Board of
Education, remarked to Mrs. Prag,
who had applied for a place: "I can
not give it to you because that is al
ready promised to one of the bright
est women, one of the best talkers
and best read women I have ever met
â Miss Kate Elliott." At first she was
assigned to the English department,
later to the science and finally, in
1890, to the history department- In
ail of these she did her full share in
giving the school the high reputation
which it enjoys to-day. Mrs. Prag
spoke of Miss Elliott's great mental
force, her extensive knowledge and
her power of adapting and assimilat
ing what she read. When John Fisk,
the historian, was here a few years
ago he was pleased to find one so fa
miliar with his best thoughts. Mrs.
Prag closed with a touching tribute
to Miss Elliott's character.
Miss Edna J. de Wolf spoke as one
of Miss Elliott's former pupils and
emphasized the teacher's singular
power in waking the* best in her pu
pils, in establishing right living and
right thinking in them and in implant
ing high ideals and worthy ambtions.
With it all were her kindly sympathy
and her unfailing readiness to give of
her abundance to all in need of it.
A note of regret was read from Dr. |
Elisha Brooks, written at his home at
Ben Lomond. "I had hoped," it ran,
"that she would enjoy many years of
leisure after her earnest life of toil, j
She was a rare soul, and her death on j
the threshold of the life she had looked
forward to with such longing is very
pathetic.
There were no dry eyes in the as
semblage after the conclusion of the
exercises.
WHY SHE WON* FRIENDS.
It is not common for people to have
and so keenly enjoy the love in which
Miss Elliott was invariably held by j
those who came into her quiet life â j
and there were more of these than
fall to the lot of most. Her gentleness.
a certain winning quaintness of man- j
ncr and speech, her genial humor '
which nothing could ever shake, her i
spontaneous wit, which never was \
barbed, her simple womanliness â these
were her principal charm to her friends
of the world beyond the schoolroom. ]
There never was evidence that she i
held a bitter thought; and her attl- !
tude to humanity was that It was not !
worth while to look for anything but j
goodness and kindness in the world.
Whether her consistent blindness to i
anything but those qualities was the \
result of a deliberately chosen course !
or was the natural expression of her
own nature may never be known. Yet ,
above all else she was intensely human. |
Her superb education, the grinding ex
actions ot a teacher's life, and often j
much and prolonged physical suffering,
never affected her childlikeness, her
faith in life and the world, her half- !
quizzical, half-dismissing bearing to
ward any wry outlook from others.
There are many firesides here that ;
cherished her, and many a quiet din
ner with friends has been savored by I
her wit and laughter and tireless good ,
cheer.
For some years her friends had been
observing with concern that her highly
sensitive organization was giving way
under the strain of her work; but she
would always say joyously that her
thirty years would suon be done, and
that then she would enjoy life. She
stopped too late.
Her will provided, among other
things, that her funeral should be
quiet, with no exercises or parade, that
she should be cremated, and her ashes
tnrown ux>on the winds. But beside
her casket last Wednesday, in this city,
the Lord's Prayer stole through the
assemblage, and that was all. And she
was at heart deeply religious and rev
erential.
On her leaving the high school last
December the faculty drew up a tes
timonial of their regard, and It was the
most cherished of her treasures. Be

3fexican Theatrical Manager
Says That Tetrazzini Broke
Her Contract With Him
ASKS FOR A FORTUNE
Sweet Singer Called Upon
to Pay $24,000 for Failure
to Keep the Agreement
The man from Mexico Is after Tet
razzini. The songl '. from Italy,
who has warbled her way into the
hearts of San Franciscans, is to be
snared in the legal meshes of the law.
When she sailed for this country her
incomparable voice and her gracious
self were constructively in a cage â an
Iron-bound proposition of the sort
conceived by wily theatrical manager j.
who insure a profit for themselves
when they engage the talents of a
public idol. It la called a contract,
and Tetrazzini is said to have done
something which the law construes as
a "â¢breach." If some lawyers are right/
it will cost Tetrazzini $24,000 and she
will not be permitted to pay the obli
gation by trilling a few high notes.
I. Lerner is the Mexican. He is a
theatrical manager in the capital city
of our sister republic, where half the
population goes wild over bullfights
and the other half is exalted by grand
opera. Lerner caged the Tetrazzini
voice, and he made a contract
for her appearance for two
months in "the United States and
Canada." San Francisco has had the
benefit of it. Happy San Francisco!
Wise Lerner! His contract contained
a clause to the effect that if its con
ditions should not be complied with,
in the absence of prescribed excuses
of war, pestilence and the like, the
singer was to forfeit, "as liquidated
damages," the whole amount of the
agreed payments for her services,
namely. $24,000, or 11000 each for
twenty-four performances.
Lerner's suit for the recovery of the
damages was filed In the Superior
Court yesterday afternoon by his at
torney, S. F. St. Sure. The complaint
itself is brief. It recites that on Jan
uary 3, 1904, at the City of Mexico.
Lerner. theatrical manager, made an
agreement in writing with Luisa Tet
razzini, artist. The plaintiff has fully
performed his part of the contract.
while she has fully failed. By the
terms of the writing the sum of $24.
000 liquidated damages is now due
the plaintiff.
To the complaint is attached a copy
of the contract. First, Lerner has c
tracted for the singer to perform in
the United States and Canada, where
she â will be bound to give her services
In all kinds of musical entertainments
that may be ordered by the manage
ment. She was bound to be ready to
depart from Havana. Cuba, on Feb
ruary 2*3, 1904. The contract was to
have a duration of two months and
take effect five days after her arrival
in this country. The manager was to
pay her $1000 for each performance,
she to perform three times a week,
and on not more than two consecutiv*
days. She was to sing all the operas
in her repertoire adapted to her voice
and in at least one new opera, whieb
she should have twelve days to learn.
If she fell sick she was to have no
power to object to the singing of her
parts by other singers or to refuse to
sing them after her recovery, nor was
she to make other use of her talents
in any public or private place. In not
complying with the contract or start*
ing on the day ordered, she was bound
to pay the whole amount, not as a fine,
but as liquidated damages. There were
other provisions relating to wardrobe,
sickness, passes, etc.. and the right
to cancel the contract was given to the
manager if be should be injured by
her misconduct.
Lerner filed a like suit against
Ernesto Colll for $2400. Colli was
promised $100 for each of twenty-four
performances.

DR. LEGGO BEATS ANANIAS
FOR THE MILE HANDICAP
Crack Colt Concedes Weight to Every Starter
in th e Race and Equals Track Record.
Cloverland Downs
Veterano by a
Neck.
From a severely plain home horse,
living the simple life, Dr. Leggo by
â¢etory in the mile handicap at
<'akland yesterday suddenly achieves
treat fame and is hailed as a phenom
enal colt.
Piloted by Bonner, the son of Pur
year D and Sevens picked up 103
I'ounda, defeating two such crack
milers as Ananias and Letola with
comparative ease in 1:39, equaling
the track record. When the sterling
three-year-old returned to the stand
tifter the finish the big half holiday
crowd, quick to recognize the worth
of the performance, save him a recep
tion the echo of which reverberated
among the Berkeley foothills.
DR. LIXiOOS CLEVER VICTORY.
This ordinary-looking, mild-man
nered bay colt was not breathing hard
enough to blow out a candle after the
feat, and still the cleverest fig-urers in
the handicapping line and the
. shrewdest of the horsemen could not
figure him a chance, conceding a lump
of weight as he wae to each of the
other four starters.
In the betiing Ananiae, the mount
of Birkenruth, with 106 pounds to
handle, ruled a strong favorite, John
ny Schorr unloading on his entry. Le
tola did not have much of a following,
be'i odds were cut from
6 to 4. The price about Dr. Leggo
soared from 4 to 6.
At the start Ananias at onoe f=kim
med away in the lead. Before half the
:ice had been covered Dr. Leggo
had moved into second position and
wa* closing on the favorite. Entering
the stretch the colt, under Bonner'e
urging, soon had Ananias extended,
â  furlong from the wire the favor
as beaten. Without being punished
. biing twice the last eighty
- the Doctor crossed the line a
he favorite. Letola was
d eight lengths away.
KKIC.HT FITIRE FOR WINNER.
Tak consideration the early
and the apparent ease with
:. it \*as accomplished his victory
:. Leggo as a colt far above
;he^ average. He was bred at A. B.
?pre< I â¢ a Stock Farm, and al
â¢ has the Aecot and California
his credit. Hip future career
watched with interest.
Favorites fared badly during the aft
n, the only winning one being
Andrew B. Cook. Equorum Rex, Adi
ck and Duwnpatrick scored at
mellow odds.
An" over-confident exhibition in the
saddle on the part of Bonner contribut
ed largely to the defeat of Achelita,
favorite for the four-furlong two-year
old scramble. Instead of letting the
iiUy sift along when he possessed a
commanding lead, the colored rider had
hiÂ» .mount under restraint part of the
route. Then, in a driving finish, Equo
rum Rex, ridden by Minder and played
from 10 down to 6, led the first choice
out more than a length in :49. Spinoza,
which at one stage had first call in the
betting, lost tVi^ show to Isabeau
ANDREW B. COOK IX FRONT.
Andrew B. Cook, an even-money
chance, captured the five-furlong dash
cleverly. His closest contender at the
finish, Arabo, closed a 30 to 1 shot. Sad
Sam, it was expected, would furnish
some of the music, but he made a dis
mal showing. Frank Otis had the
mount on Andrew B. Cook and took
the bush wonder out in front at the
start. Under the vigorous handling of
Truebel Arabo closed strongly, only
losing by half a length in l:00Â»4. Ruby
ran a good third.
Otis also piloted Adirondack, winner
of the five-furlong sprint, with the
weights raised ten pounds above the
scale. Eight to 1 could be obtained
about the gelding and Otis had him out
blazing the route from start to finish.
Travers came from the rear with Best
Man, downing Edinborough for the
place. Ponapa, the post favorite, fin
ished back in the ruck, after mixing
among the leaders to the stretch.
CLOVERLAXD BEATS VETERANO.

after Meistersinger from the
leadership, was brought to a hard
drive at the end, then only earning the
decision over Veterano by a neck in
2:09 flat. Major Mansir, the favorite,
had no speed and at no time looked
dangerous.
"Big Bill" Knapp, on Ara, a 9 to 10
favorite, tossed away the last pur?e,

TRACK NOTES.
Otis piloted two winners. Frank
appears to be riding in his old form.
Truebel, who rode with marked suc
cess at Ascot Park, made his first ap
pearance at Oakland on "Kansas"
Price's Arabo in the second race. He
handled his mount cleverly, creating a
most favorable impression.
Eddie Walsh, anoiher capable rider
from Ascot Park, rode Schoolmate in
the handicap. He had no opportunity
to shine, but he will be heard from next
week.
Starter Dick Dwyer leaves for Los
Angeles to-night, where he will handle
the gate for the next five weeks.
Dick's work at Oakland has been of
a brilliant nature, perhaps the beÃt of
his career.
After reviewing the raceg run by
Gallopoff, the stewards at Oakland de
cided yesterday to suspend M. J. Daly
and his stable for a period of thirty
days. Jockey Willie Daly is included
lr the ruling. In his races run pre
vious to Friday Gallopoff waa quoted
at long odds and comparatively little
money was lost on his chances, but
the officials thought the improvement
shown too marked.
Twenty-five books cut in.

TRAINING DRAWS
NEAR ITS END
Corbett and Nelson Will Do
No More Serious Boxing
Until They Meet Tuesday
WEIGHT SEEMS EASY
Dane's Friends Are Thought
to Be Trying to Influ
ence Odds in the Betting
The long siege of training which
Young Corbett and Battling Nelson
have gone through for their battle on
next Tuesday night is drawing to a
close. Both boxers are gradually ta
pering off the strenuous work they
have indulged in at their respective
training camps at San Rafael and
Larkspur.
Both are in fine fettle, neither having
had a setback during the long cam
paign. A victory means much for
either of them, as the winner gets an
other opportunity to fight Britt- On
the occasion of their former battle Nel
son decisively defeated Corbett, but the
little Denverite claimed he was out of
condition. He has trained earnestly for
the past two months and no excuses
will be offered if Nelson should again
be victorious.
There is a doubt in the minds of
many people as to whether or not Cor
bett can regain his old-time form. He
has always been successful in his re
turn fights. He lost a decision to Ben
ny Yanger, and in a return engage
ment the fight was called a draw. The
decision, however, should have been
awarded to Corbett, as he cut his op
ponent to ribbons.
Corbett was then knocked out by
Young Derapsey, but he turned the ta
bles in a return engagement. The same
thing occurred in his battles with Kid
Broad, and the San Francisco public
still remembers his encounters with
Eddie Hanlon. If history repeats itself
Corbett should be the victor.
Bud Hauser of New York and John
McNamara and Tim McGrath visited
Shannon's villa yesterday to get a line
on Corbett's condition. They are old
friends and all declare him to be In the
best possible condition. Gymnasium
work and boxing have been abandoned
by Corbett, as Trainer McDonald
thinks the date of the battle too close
to take any /chances of his protege in
juring his hands.
Corbett rested yesterday morning,
but in the afternoon he and Gans took
a long run over the hills. The weather
was extremely warm and Corbett per
spired freely. Joe Gans' standby for re
ducing is road work and it was he who
Induced McDonald to cut out gymna
sium exercise. After a brisk rundown
it was announced that Corbett weighed
about 133 pounds. Road work will be
indulged in to-day and to-morrow.
Corbett expects to rest on Tuesday un
til he enters the ring.
Battling Nelson is beginning to take
things easily at his training camp at
Larkspur. The Dane is in the best pos
sible condition, but, as ring followers
know, he never neglects to train. All
fighters look alike to him and he holds
none cheaply. He is a glutton for
work and seldom has to be urged to
don his working clothes.
This is the fourth occasion that Bat
has worked at Larkspur, and people
who have followed his movements de
clare him to be at his best condition.
Yesterday morning Bat took a short
run, accompanied by Manager Billy
Nolan, Bill Benner, Rawhide Kelly and
Fred Landers. Bat's training mates
take kindly to the road when the dis
tance is short.
Yesterday afternoon Nelson spent
about half an hour in the gymnasium,
going through his regular work. He
boxed three rounds with Fred Landers,
but the work was slow compared with
the boxing of last week. Billy Nolan
did not want Bat to don the gloves and
it was only with the promise that he
would take things easily that he was
allowed to box. After being rubbed
down Nelson's weight was given out as
being 133 pounds. He will work to-day
and to-morrow, but will rest Tuesday.
Nelson's advisers have claimed he will
have trouble making the weight, but
it is thought this was done to influ
ence the betting. His friends are san
guine he will win. On their last show
ing Nelson should rule a' pronounced
favorite, and it was apparently to in
fluence the price that alarmist reports
were sent out. The betting public is
not to be caught so easily, especially
when it is known Nelson is training on
so well.
Corbett is also showing his best form,
but it will take the nerve-racking
work of the actual fight to determine
whether the old vitality is behind the
powerful muscles he has built up or
whether it disappÂ«ared beyond recall
during his nine months of idleness.

POPPIES SHOW
IN CUP STAKE
Promising Young Grey
hounds Appear in Competi
tion for the Belle Brandon
SIX STILL REMAIN IX
Richard Anton Is Installed
Overnight Favorite for
the California Plate
Two rounds of the Belle Brandon
Challenge Cup stake for young grey
hounds were run yesterday at Union
Coursing Park. Six of the young
hounds remain to compete this after
noon for the cup. They represent six
different sires, an unusual condition.
The sires represented are Hadiwist,
Fine Fire, Moondyne 11, Rocker, Pep
per Hill and Humbug.
No one of the young dogs stands out
above the others, so it will require to
day's competition to develop the star
of the sextet. The bettors had no
line on the puppies, the result being
that six choices in a row went down to
defeat. Lupin, a 1 to 3 choice, led and
was then beaten by Bartagis, one of
the Kansas hounds. The three repre
sentatives of Real Article led to the
hare and were then outworked.
The card for to-day is an attractive
one. Richard Anton is favorite in the
overnight betting for the California
Plate at odds of 5 to 1. Valley Pride is
at 7; Carlow Boy, Belle Free and Agile
Spurt, 8; Renegade Apache, Quita,
Humboldt and Barge, 10.
In the reserve stake Rocker Arm is
favorite at 5 to 1, with Amandan a
close second at 6 to 1. The day's re

BLOOD PURIFIERShggC
In every collection of things there is a superior, one that stands 7^^ feaF *Â£&?
above all the rest and is known as the best, or king of its class. By I \^^^lj^|^^* '"
its record of forty years of cnres S. S. S. has demonstrated its snperi- ~*^^^%o^Bm&
ority over all other blood purifiers and is known and recognized every- '^^^^^^Uj j
where as the best â The King of Blood Purifiers. The people everywhere
endorse it, and there are few homes where this great remedy is not known and f .?J
used, and today there are thousands in all parts of the country who have been cured IB ,
of diseases by its use and who are daily recommending it to those who are in need of n\ :~: ~
a blood purifier. It has held the confidence of the public for this long period of time, .Â» n -
and is more in favor now than ever before, because it does all that is claimed for it, 1 â¢
' and "S. S. S. for the blood" has grown to be a household saying. *
, One of its greatest claims to the title of "The King of: Blood Purifiers" is that It ii
purely vegetable, being made entirely from roots, herbs and barks of the forests and fields,
selected for their purifying and healing action on the blood and their fine tonic properties .
for building up and strengthening the entire system. Not so with the usual blood medicines, â 
for they contain Potash and other strong mineral ingredients that derange the stomach and
digestion and otherwise damage the health. '.'
Bad blood is responsible for most of the ailments of mankind. When from any causey
the I^ver, Kidneys, Bowels or other organs of bodily waste become torpid, dull or sluggish
in their action, and fail to carry out the poisons which are being constantly formed in the
system, these poisons are absorbed by the blood. As this vital fluid is the very life of the
body, nourishing and supplying strength, through its circulation, to every muscle, nerre,
bone and tissue, disease in some form is sure to follow when it becomes contaminated.
; IPJPHnMBMMI Eczema, Tetter, Acne, Pimples, Boils,

noltLjuriouHo thetyl^emandSw^s "pabie of purify! distressing kching and burning as well

sohnyikiii Haven, Pa. mrs. Clara daubert. wlii remain to torment the sutterer. wo
v : amount of salves, washes, skin foods, rouge,
etc., can reach the trouble; a real blood remedy is required. S. S. S. cures these and all other
: skin diseases, and when it has cleansed the blood of the poisons and impurities the cure is
I permanent and lasting. Rheumatism, Catarrh, Scrofula, Chronic Sores or Ulcers and Con-
tagious Blood Poison are all deep-seated blood diseases. When the blood becomes contami-
nated i with the poisons producing these diseases, the entire circulation grows polluted and
vitiated, and these painful and dangerous diseases will continue to grow worse until this vital
fluid is cleansed and made strong and healthy again. .'
In ; all these disorders S. S. S. has proved itself a perfect remedy, and has well earned *
{ the title of "The i King of Blood Purifiers." It goes down into the blood and forces out all
poison of every kind, all waste and foreign matter, and makes it pure and health-sustaining
as nature intended, curing the disease permanently. Nothing reaches inherited blood taint
pr old chronic troubles like S. S. S., and being a strictly vegetable remedy it can be taken
â¢by old or young without fear of bad after-effects or injury in any way to the system. Not
only is S. S. S. a blood purifier and system builder of the highest order, but a tonic and
; appetizer without ;: an equal, and â¢ is unexcelled in cases of general i debility, loss of â¢ appetite,
weakness, that tired, run-down condition, lack of energy and force, and other distressing
complaints common to Spring and Summer months.
; If you have a:*Â»/ blood trouble write us about it, stating the case fully, and our physi-
cians will â  help you to get rid of ;it by free medical advice and will send books on the different
diseases, which contain valuable information, without charge.

CLAREMONT CLUB
IS VICTORIOUS
Sun Francisco Team Loses
the First Home-and-Home
Match by a Large Margin
DEFEAT IS DECISIVE
Only One of the Visiting
Twelve Comes In "With I
Lead Over His Opponent
The Claremont Country Club team
won the first home-and-home match
over thirty-six holes of the Interclub
tournament yesterday, beating the rep
resentatives of the San Francisco Golf
and Country Club by 38 points. In the
first half cÂ£ the match, played on the
Hth inst. on the Presidio course, the
Claremont team obtained a lead of
seven points, and yesterday 29 points
were added, making the total gain 38
points.
The Rev. E. E. Baker, one of the
substitutes of the Claremont team.
took the place of R. W. Fitzgerald, and
F. H. Beaver played instead of Perry
Eyre of the San Francisco team. Cap
tain J. S. Oyster was the only member
of the San Francisco team who beat
his opponent, winning 2 up. or 1VÂ»
points. The scoring was by points, the
hole that won a rr.atr-h counting one
point, and each additional hole increas
ing the score by half a point.
The day was lovely and the Clare- ;
mont course looked at its best. The
fair green waa in execellent condition
an.l the putting-greens were fast and
true. The details of the play are
shown in the table:

The Claremont Country Club haa
now won the first match of the Inter
club Tournament. A second 36-hole
match, eighteen holes on the Presidio
course and eighteen on the Claremont
links, will be played in April. If thd
Claremont team should prove victori
ous in this also, the silver trophy will
become the property of the Claremont
Country Club. If the San Francisco
team should win, a tie will result. This
will be played off later on a neutral
course.
