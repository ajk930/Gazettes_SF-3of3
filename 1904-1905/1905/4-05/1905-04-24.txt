France's insistence upon Rojestven-

DEATH SUMMONS
JEFFERSON.
End Comes to the Eminent Actor
at His Home in Florida.
WEST PALM BEACH. Fla.. April 23.
Joseph Jefferson, the eminent actor,
died at hi? home, "The Reefs," at Palm
Bearh at 6:15 o'clock this evening. The
end came after a day of unconscious
ness and after a heroic struggle which
had exhausted the patient's vitality. At
his deathbed were his wife, his sons,
Charles B. and Frank Jefferson, his
nurse, Miss Mabel Bingham, Dr. R. B.
Potter and his faithful old servant,
Carl Kettler.
The end waa not a surprise to the
family. Ever since his last sinking
spell, which came after a rally on
Thursday morning and which was fol
lo-wd by an apparent improvement
until Friday, the family has been wait
!r,p for the end.
Jefferson's condition on Saturday
night grew steadily worse and the
members of the family, who had re
tired, were summoned from their beds
and Dr. Potter was called. The Da
tient's condition continued to itrow
worse all through to-day and the brief
I'ullftins from the bedside contained no
words of encouragement.
The sickness of Jefferson, which
ended in his death, was contracted, it
is believed, while on a recent visit to
his son. Charles, at Hobe's Sound, a
few mile?! pbove Palm Beach, where he
v.ent to meet his friend, former Presi
dent Cleveland.
It if believed that from a s!ig:ht indis
cretion In his eating there he suffered
an attack of indigestion. Sinre his re
turn liomo his condition grew steadily
worse- v.:tn slight rallies until the end.
Thp body of Jefferson will be taken
to Buzzards Uay on a special train to
morrow, accompanied by all the mem
bers of hi* family who aro here,. It
will reach New YorK on Wednesday
morning and the family hopr-s to reach
I-suzzards Bay the evening <>f that day.
It was on April 1 that Jefferson went
to Hobe Sound to meet Cleveland acd
other friends at the home of Charles B.
Jefferson. The party spent about a
week there and during that time there
were Ashing expeditions. Jefferson ap
peared acilve. but as he bad been rest-
Ing at his home at Palm Beach and had
alqf^st recovered his strength from the
illness which pulled him down last
spring, he was over-confident and over
exerted himself. It was at a 6upper

which, it is thought, brought on the at
tack of indigestion.
When Jefferson became ill he return
ed to the Reefs and was taken to his
room on the second floor of the cot
tage, which is only one hundred feet
from the ocean, where he could watch
the sea The weather was favorable
I throughout his illnosp.
Dr. Potter, the family physician at
the Florida home, livpd three miles
from thf Reefs and went occasionally
to the bedside of his patient, feeling
that Jefferson might survive. But when
the first critical period occurred he
j spent mopt of his time there and
called Dr. Worley of St. Augustine, a
specialist, for a consultation.
It was soon seen that Jefferson had
iÂ«not the strength to shake off the at
i tack and his death was only a question
of days.
JEFFERSOX A GREAT ACTOR.
His Remarkable Career and Success
in "Rip Van Winkle."
"Joe" Jefferson was born In Phlladel-
I phia February 20, 1R29. He waa the

eminent English actor and manager.
He was born at Plymouth, England, in
1774 and came to this country in 1796,
making his first appearance In New
York at the theater in John street. He

â where he was permanently engaged
; during a period of twenty-seven years.
He died in 1532. HÂ«> married in 1800 a

! family of childrf n. .
His son. Joseph Jefferson the second,
was born in Philadelphia in 1804 and
died of yellow fever in Mobile. Ala., in
: 1842. He was an excellent actor in 'old
j men" parts and also a fine scene paint

Bided adjoined the theater of which h*Â»
was manager, and the boy had the run

ThÂ« parents of Miss Aurelia Henry,
who graduated from the University of
California In 1898. have Just received
word of their daughter's good fortune
In being awarded the European fel
lowship of the Association of Colleg
iate Alumnae. The home of the Henry
family Is at 1809 Euclid avenue, Berke
ley.
Mtes Aurelia Henry is regarded as
one of the most brilliant students that
have graduated from Californa. She
took the degree of Doctor of Philoso
phy at Tale, taught later at LÂ»e*viston,
Idaho, in the State Normal School,
and now will go abroad to enjoy In
Europe the advantages of the Euro
pean Fellowship.
The Association of Collegiate Alum
nae is a national organization of
women college graduates, with
branches in twenty-nine different
cities and a membership of more than
3000. It supports the European Fel
lowship with the aim of promoting ad
vanced study by college women who
"give promise of distinction through
original gifts, previous training, en
ergy, power of endurance and health."
The bestowal of the fellowship is
based upon evidence of the candidate's
ability and of her promise of success
in her chosen line of study. It is not
usually granted to those who intend
to take uj> the profession of law. the
ministry or medicine. "Women who are
looking forward to positions as teach
ers or professors or to literary or
scientific vcatlons are given the pref
erence.
Miss Henry's achievement, that is
believed to have won for her the
coveted fellowship, is a fine transla
tion, recently made, of Dante's "De

PITTSBURO. April 23.â The Western
part of Pennsylvania is now ripe for
revolt and there is serious talk of
asking that the great Keystone State
be divided, the twenty-three cour.'^s
west of the crest of the Allegheny
mountains to be known as the State
of Allegheny.
For some years there have been
murmurings against the way In which
the Philadelphia region has used the
. Legislature and Congress to further
only * iKe Â«nds of that "part of tha
! State, and the feeling grew : wanner at
the meeting of the Legislature ' Just
ended. To-day the Plttsburg Leader,
very close to Western Pennsylvania
bosses, came out in a three column ar
ticle calling for a division of the
State, the dividing line to be the water
shed of the Allegheny Mountain* and
the State to be named Allegheny.
Attention Is called to the prophetic
words of Abraham. Lincoln, who once
referred to this section as "The State
of Allegheny. " meaning at that time,
perhaps, Allegheny County. in which
Pittsburg and Allegheny are situated,
as well as the greatest steel plants
in the world.

the move, would have a population of

the last twenty years maintained,
would in the census of 1910 take sev

K^ covered is constantly being widened and extended; important discoveries have recently been made, which render extremely valuable the area now controlled by this company, and as well as that in which it is proposed to operate Sat

WÂ§. The remarkable discoveries made within the past two or three years in Western and Southwestern Nevada, embracing such districts as Tonopah, Goldfield, Bullfrog, Kawick, Lida, et al, call attention conspicuously to " Â«
S the opportunities for organized talent and capital prepared to operate in those districts. Notwithstanding the la<*k of capitai many splendid fortunes have been made. â Â§^
BJ| â¦. In nearly every instance those fortunes have been made at an astounding premium. Thus only have the very high grade ores been shipped at costs ranging from $20.00 to $40.00 per ton. Had ample capital been in hand â  5
gt? at the beginnig nearly the whole of the values could have been converted to the profit of the owners, instead of to transportation, reduction and other companies.. Such a condition as this presupposes only exceptionally high grade SBS B
U*| ores, while those of lower value either remain un worked altogether or are handled at a heavy disadvantage. A large proportion of mining dividends are derived not from bonanza ores, but from those of medium or even low value *m
jÂ«j B and the paying and going concerns of to-day are ones In which ample capital is in hand to make a success wherein for the lack of capital failure would follow. This is peculiarly true of all industrials,, and is conspicuously true j a
of mining. With these facts in view, it is considered that the Tonopah Home Consolidated Mines & Exploration Co. is in an excellent: position, and, operating as it is in such a wonderfully rich section, that early and large divi- I 8

SAN PEDRO, April 23.â Owners of
coastwise lumber vessels, both sail
and steam, are viewing with much
alarm the growth of the log rafting

the coast service cannot continue to
operate, if, in fact, it does not com
pletely drive the smaller sailing
schooners out of the lumber trade.
Several log rafts will be brought
from the Columbia river to San Fran
cisco during the summer by thq Ham

of water. It will contain the enormous
amount of 8,000,000 feet of lumber,

squadron from Kamranh Bay and af
firmed ncr determination to maintain
neutrality, ie received here with pleas

accomplished before he was ordered to
leave.
The Foreign Office, In a statement
issued to-day, says:
"The French Government, upon re
ceipt of the report that the Baltic
[ squadron had arrived at Kamranh Bay,
; instructed the Governor General of
Indo-Chino to strictly enforce the rules
of French neutrality. Subsequently the
Japanese Government lodged a protest
with France and the French Govern
ment issued new special instructions to
the Governor General for transmlttal
to the Russians, ordering them to leave
French territorial waters as soon as
possible. The Governor General tele
graphed, replying that he had taken
the necessary measures according to
instructions by the French Govern
ment, and simultaneously addressed
the Russian Government, asking that
the admiral be instructed to leave ter
ritorial waters. The Russian Govern
ment replied that It had already sent
such Instructions. The French gave as
surances that they had taken, and
would take in the future, necessary
measures to see that neutrality is rig
orously respected."

In IS2^ the family started on a tour

terminated in :~42 at Mobile with the
death of his father two weeks after
their arrival in that city. Mrs. Jeffer
'â 'pened a boarding-house and her

following the United States army into
the latter country. Returning to the
United Prates. Jefferson took up his
residence in Philadelphia, where he ap

He afterward conducted the dramatic
performances at Prale's Museum, and
then started on his first star engage

ho was recalled to Philadelphia by th.3
deatn of his mother, to whom he was
very devoted.
In 1549 he met and married Miss
Laekger, an actress, then under en
gagement at the Chatham Theater.

At the age of 22 Mr. Jefferson played
the important part of Marrall to the
elder Booth's Sir Giles Overreach in "A
New Way to Pay Old Debts." After
two seasons of metropolitan stock
playing he went into partnership with
a friend in the management of theaters
In Savannah and Macon. Ga_ Then he
was engaged as actor and manager in

Jarrett's Theater in the Baltimore Mu

ehrewd. keen Yankee. Asa Trenchard.
vgE an instance of admirable character
g entirely original with him. and
â o different from the customary staere
Yankee as to eventually drive that
;iture from the stage.
"Our American Cousin" ran more
than 150 nights and has continued to
be a favorite ever since. Before its
Beason was ended Jefferson acknowl
edged that Sothern had made Lord
Dundreary the most taking character
of the piece, but those who saw the
two men in their respective parts kno*
that Jefferson's performance of Asa
Trenchard was the essential factor in
making Pothern's "Lord Dundreary"
' ful.
During his engagement at Laura

a' number of parts tb*i h*Â» ]at*>r made

Newman Noggw in "Nicholas Nkkle

taken off "A Midsummer Xight's
Dream" was produced. Jefferson was
to have played the part of Bottom,
but after one rehearsal he felt that
he would make a failure of the part
and resigned the character.
Soon after this he took "Our Amer
ican Cousin" on a starring tour, with
the understanding that he would give
the management half of the profits for
the use of the play. This was the be
ginning of financial success for Jef
ferson, as he reaped the full benefit
of his great acting for himself rather
than for his managers as before.
In 1860 he came to California, and,
after a most successful season in this
city and other places in the State,
went on to Australia, where like suc
cess greeted him. At Hobart Town,
Tasmania, the capital of the penal
colony, he played "The Ticket-of-
Leave Man" before a large audience,
which comprised among other per
sons over 100 ticket-of-leave men.
These took a great liking for Mr. Jef
ferson on account of his rendering of
the character, Bob Brierly, and they
could not but believe that he was one
of themselves.
In May. 1*65. Jefferson sailed from
Melbourne for England via Callao and
Panama. Meeting Dion Boucicault in
London, he suggested to the latter that
he work up the play which later be
came so indissoluly linked with Jef
forson's name, "Rip Van Winkle."
His own account of how he hap
pened tn hit upon this part is quite
interesting. During the summer of
1559 he was boarding with his family
at an old Dutch farmhouse in Penn
sylvania, and while there came upon
the "Life and Letters of Washington
Irving" and was greatly pleased to
find therein a reference to himself by
Irving, who had seen him play Gold-
Unoh in "The Road to Ruin" at Laura
Keene's Theater. This brought to his
mind Irving's "Sketch Book" and then
"Rip Van Winkle " The story had al
ready been dramatized two or three
time 1 ? and had been acted in London
and elsewhere, but with not much suc
cess. Jefferson got together the various
dramatizations and out of them con
cocted one which he played in Wash
ington under the management of John
T. Raymond. The results were not
satisfactory: but. still believing In the
possibilities of the play, he offered it
as a theme to Boucicault on his arrival
in London. Baucirault rewrote the
drama to about the condition it was
played later with such success and for
â O preat a time.
Its lirst performance was at the
Adelphi Theater, where Jefferson then
had an engagement, on Monday, Sep
tember 5. 18C5. The play ran 170 nights,
and at the conclusion of his engage
ment Jefferson acted it in Manchester
and Liverpool with like success for a
l^nn time and then sailed for New
York.
ITS SVCCESS IX AMERICA.
On September 6, 1866, Jefferson pro
duced for the lirst time in America the
Boucicault version of "Rip Van Win
kle" at the Olympic Theater, Xew
York, with a support that included
many names that later achieved high
place in the histrionic sky. The play
and "Joe"* Jefferson were at once es
tablished in the hearts of American
playgoers, and became thereafter the
most taking card in Jefferson's col
lection. He became so thoroughly iden
tified with "Rip Van Winkle" that he
even thought and talked as "Rip" off
the stage at times.
Going once to a bank in Louisville,
Ky., to cash a check that he had re
ceived, the teller to whom he was a
stranger refused to pay it unless he
was identified, and asked him if there
was any one near by who knew him.
Jefferson said no and added: "If my
dog, Schneider, was here he would
know me." The money was handed
over without further demur. The teller
had seen "Rip" a day or two before and
heard that memorable plaint of the old
man.
"Rip Van Winkle" was played by
Jefferson during a period of thirty-six
>^ars in every city and large town in
the United States and In many of the
cities of England and Scotland, and
some in Ireland, always drawing large
audiences. It is said that Boucicault
received in purchase money and royal
ties for his work on "Rip Van Winkle"
over $26,000.
In 1871 Jefferson purchased a planta
tion on Bayou Teche, Lousiana. where
he spent a good part of his time during
the winter season; going in the sum
mer to a farm which he had purchased
in New Jersey. Of later years he spent
most of his time on one or the other
places, caring little for the exactions
and excitements of city life, but always
glad to see his friends, whom he enter
tained in the old-fashioned really
hospitable manner.
HIS GREAT CAPABILITIES.
Besides his remarkable ability as an
actor, Jefferson had quite a talent as
a painter. His work was of the im
pressionist school and a pleasing re
minder of that of the celebrated French
artist Carot.
In 1867 Jefferson married his second
wife, Sarah Warren, in Chicago. In
1889-90 Jefferson's autobiography was
published in the Cer.tury Magazine and
the plain, modest manner in which he
mid the story of his life was very
characteristic of the man.
As an actor Jefferson was remark
able for having departed from the
traditions of the stass, even in the
performance of such well-known char
acters as Bob Acres, Dr. Pangloss and
others of the old English comedies,
and rendering them according: to his
own interpretation. This was at first
regarded as a kind of audacious egot
ism by the critics, but it took well
With the people, who saw in his im
personations new and pleasing revela
tions that had entirely escaped former
Tenderers of the parts. His absolute
truth to nature was always his most
marked quality. His Asa Trenchard
was a character whose simplicity was
only equaled by its absolute verity
as a transcription of a certain Amer
ican type. His Rip Van Winkle stood
out as one of the most brilliant and
beautiful creations of the stage. Deep
ly pathetic, and at the same time
vivant with a humor peculiarly its
ovrn, this character, as made by Jef
ferson, claimed the attention and
touched the heart of the American
people more than any other outside
the range of the Shakespearean drama.
Joe Jefferson was a great actor, and,
more than that, a great man. He
had a *reat heart in his breast.

him. While the fight was on a police
man came on the scene and arrested

while on his way back to his home that
he had the trouble with the policeman.

liceman, but simply inquired from the
official why he was arrestinsr his
brother. He says the policeman made
an effort to push him aside and it was
then the unknown man, who was also
under arrest, pulled away from the
policeman and made his escape.

HINKEL SAYS HE WILL
NOT CONTEST FOR SEAT
Anxious to % Learn
if Money Was
Used.
Has No Purpose to
Oust Rickard
From Seat
BERKELEY, April 23. â "I hare
not the slightest Intention of con
testing Thomas Rickards seat in
the Board of Trustees," said John
Hlnkel to-day. "I do not care for the
position, though after I was nominated
by the non-partisan organization I
made a straightforward race for the
place. No matter what may be the
outcome of the investigation I or my
friends are making of the manner in
which the student vote was polled at
the last election, there; will be no con
test to follow."
John Hinkel is the Berkeley capital
ist who was defeated by Thomas
Rlckard in the recent contest for the
Trusteeship from the Second Ward. The
vote of the university students who
reside in his ward and who cast bal
lots at the election on April 10 will be
thoroughly investigated, he declares, to
determine whether there was any
illegal voting.
The defeated candidate was to have
held a conference to-day with a num
ber of his friends who have been look
ing into the methods alleged to have
been employed by Hinkel's opponents
in politics, but the conference was post
poned for a few days until the Investi
gation is completed. Interest In the af
fair has died away with the announce
ment that Mr. Hinkel has no thought
of contesting Rickard's seat, it being
understood that no official action of
any sort is contemplated.
The university authorities are said
to have begun an investigation of the
story that students voted illegally and
received money for their votes, but no
university professor or officer admits
knowledge of such an investigation.
Mr. Hinkel has not been called upon
by any university officer for proofs of
the alleged wrongdoing, and no other
man connected with the private inves
tigation Instituted by Hinkel has been
asked to enlighten the university ad
ministration.

RABBI MAKES
STERLING TALK
Contrasts the Evils of His
Own Country With Eussia
and Sounds Warning Note
OAKLAND, April 23.â The condition
of the masses of this country were
sharply contrasted with the condition
of the masses in Russia by Rabbi
Friedlander last night in a Good Fri
day address at the First Hebrew Con
gregation at Twelfth and Castro
streets. The address was entitled
"The Past and the Present," and the
serious and warning note struck by the
rabbi has created much comment
among the followers of the faith of
Juaism in this city In this connec
tion he said In part:
Russia is facing a crisis brought on by un
just and unreasonable arrogatlon of power by
the ruling potentates. America | is ( facing,. a
problem arising from illegitimate and unre
stricted amassing of wealth by the controlling
money magnates. In Russia It is a struggle
between the people and the Government,
threatening the overthrow of the bureaucracy.
Here ".it Is a struggle between capital and la
borâbetween the people ; among- â¢ the ' people
threatening the overthrow â of the entire in
dustrial system and the undermining of the
very foundation of our liberty. In Russia' the
people clamor for more civic : and political
equality, - th* concession of - which means a
curtailing of the present power of . the â  Govern
ment over the people. Here the people ask
for more economic equality, the adjustment â of
which entails an assumption of more | power
mare ethical duties by the Government 'towarV
the condition and needs of the people. : :
The people complain that the combination of
capital in vast amounts held by corporations,
trusts and syndicates crowds out capable men
with small means and gains control over the
time and wages of the laborers, which Involves
the greatest Industrial evils; the small produc
er or Individual driven to want, and the labor
er forced to submit to overwork and underpay.
This Is the complaint. Is It true? If this
complaint Is well founded,' then the present
system must lead to a wide gap between the
classes and the masses.*- an evil which caused
the downfall of ail republics In the past, and
which must surely though slowly undermine
our own. national strength. Now capital. de
nies this. The capitalist calls himself a bene
factor I and says he creates employment and'
frequently gives large Bums to educational and
charitable institutions. " .* Â "." " .". i'
The laboring man doea not want his chari
ties. He holds with Emerson, "Let no man
think himself absolved because he does a gen
erous action and befriends the poor, but let
him see whether he so holds his property that
a benefit goes from It to all."
If the laboring man Is right. If his cry Is
well founded, then he must be listened to and
receive justice. Then government, which, ac
cording to the old book, is a divine institution,
must right it. Then it la the duty of the
Government to call a halt to human greed.

CURE FOR MENINGITIS
CHICAGO. April 88. â Human blood
serum injected into the spinal canal
is almost a certain cure for cerebro
spinal meningitis, according to Dr.
Ludwig Hektoen, professor of pathol
ogy in Rush Medical College. He
declared that he had proved his state
ments in his laboratory. Scientifically
the theory is that blood serum admin
istered strengthens the resisting power
in the white corpuscles of the blood of
the patient, making the corpuscles
able to fight successfully the invading
bacteria.

SEEKS DEATH
DESPERATELY
Aged and Despondent Baker
Makes Three Attempts to
End His Unhappy Life
ENGINE STOPS IN TIME
At Hospital Tries to Slash
His Throat and Then to
Strangle Himself on Cot
OAKLAND, April M.â Michael Karl,
65 years old and a baker by occupa
tion, whose home is at 240 Dore street,
San Francisco, deliberately threw
himself in front of a Seventh street
local train this afternoon in an at
tempt to commit suicide. While being
treated at the hospital he tried to
slash his throat with a razor and again
meeting with. failure sought to strangle
himself after being placed in bed.
After this he was put under close
watch of the attendants to prevent
further effort at self-destruction.
When Earl threw himself across the
railroad track his life was saved be
cause the train was moving under
slow headway. At the Receiving Hos
pital Dr. O. D. Hamlin examined the
patient but found only an injury to
the left hip that was not serious.
It was on Seventh street, a short dis
tance west of Webster, that Earl
made his desperate effort to die. He
ran out to the track as the westbound
6:10 o'clock train, with Engineer James
Irelan In the cab, approached. Just
as the engine was almost upon him,
Earl dropped to the ground and threw
himself flat across the rails in front
of the locomotive. Engineer Irelan
caught a glimpse of the man in time
to put on brakes.
Earl's failure to end his life under
the train wheels only added to his de
termination to die. After the surgeons
had completed their examination. Earl
suddenly drew a razor from his coat
pocket and tried to cut his throat
while he was lying on the operating
table In the hospital. Dr. Hamlin saw
the keen-edged tool in time to grab
the man, and prevent him from ac
complishing his purpose.
This second failure did not dis
courage the despondent patient from
trying a third time. He was placed
on a cot in the large ward and there
made an attempt to strangle himself
to death by cording a pillow slip about
his neck. Earl tightened the cloth and
fastened one end to the head of the
bed. Harry Borchert, the hospital
steward, caught the slowly suffocating
old man and quickly removed the
noosed slip. Earl was restored and
was placed under restraint so that he
could make no further attempt. The
hospital attendants believe he is de
mented.
Earl said he was despondent because
bis money was gone and his people
Among the old man's effects were
found letters addressed to the Coroner
and to J- S. Earl, 806 Larkln street,
San Francisco, a son. The message
set forth that the writer intended to
commit suicide because his family had
abandoned him. The son said to-night:
"My father is subject to fits of tem
porary insanity. He has property and
means with which to care *or himself.
Friday night a flre occurred in the flat
above his home and damaged his place
by water. He spent last night with
me. I had no idea he was contemplat
ing suicide."
FORMER GOVERNOR BRODIE
EN ROUTE TO PHILIPPINES

to the Military Secretary's depart
ment of the army as assistant chief of
the Record and Pension Office, arrived
here Saturday and is staying at the
Occidental Hotel. He is on his way
to the Philippines, for which he will
depart next week. Major Brodie is an
intimate friend of President Roose
velt's, whom he assisted in raising the
Rough Rider Regiment. His appoint
ment to a position In the army was
made early in February and created
much comment in tfce military de
partment by reason of the fact that he
was advanced over the heads of many
other officers.
The position of assistant chief of
the Record and Pension Office was
held by Major Edward S, Fowler, who
was replaced by Brodie. It was the
original Dlan of the President to have
Brodie succeed Fowler when the lat
ter'B term expired in May, but an act
of Congress abolishing the office as
soon as a vacancy occurred changed
the President's plans and hastened the
Appointment of Arizona's Governor,
who immediately resigned the latter
position and reported to Washington.
The major is going to the Philippines

says that while away he, will be ad

at the Japanese capital during the two
days the steamship will lie at Yoko
hama. The trip to the Philippines was
planned months ago and the pause in
Japan Is a mere incident- It will be
the largest company of officials and
legislators from the United States that
ever visited a foreign capital.
Although the primary mission is to
see the Philippines in order' that the
future legislative policy concerning the
American far Eastern possessions may
be assisted by personal knowledge, it
is generally felt here that great sig
nificance will be attributed to the visit
to Tokio by ether powers interested In
the Far East. The Washington Gov
ernment will try to forestall false Ideas
about the trip.
Among those who will sail with Sec
retary Taft from San Francisco in
July are: Senators Allison, earmark,
Long, Newlands, Patterson, Daniel,
Dubols, Scott, Stone and Warren;
Speaker Cannon, Representatives Coch
ran, Crumpacker, Curtis, Cooper, Dear
mond, Foss, Gillett. Grosvenor, Hep
burn, Hill, Payne, Scott, Watson, Sher
ley, Howard, Jones and Longworth. In
this party are represented some of
strongest influences in both Republican
and Democratic circles of Congress.
The American legislators will spend
six days In Japan, a day or two In
Canton, China, and the rest of the
time In the Philippines. They will hear
as much while there of China and
Chinese politics as they hear in the
United States of the ins and outs of
national politics. For this reason the
diplomats In Washington, the State
Department officials and representa
tives of American manufacturing Inter
ests, who are anxious to conquer the
markets of the Pacific, expect much
to come of this Oriental pilgrimage in
the shape of Increased knowledge and
stimulated interest among the legisla

America's interests there.

"We hereby record our deep sense of
sorrow and regret at this Inexcusable
conduct and wrong on thÂ« part of our
brother, which has brought discredit
and reproach upon the church, and
give It as our deliberate 'Judgment
that It Is the duty of our brother, so
far as it Is In his power, to make a con
fesslon of his wrong and purge the
church from all sanction and complic

At Saturday afternoon 1 * session
Barr made a public acknowledgment
and apology that was accepted.
C. C. Reynolds, the divorced man
whom Rev. Mr. Barr married was

The Lincoln Gun Club held an old

Inarleside traps. Many old features,
as well as new ones, were introduced
during the day. The first event, under
the Rose System In which birds were
thrown from unknown traps, was
taken by Donohoe, who broke 12
birds. The next event was similar,
but the contestant was compelled to
hold his gun below the elbow. In
this Webb broke 12 birds and was
high man.
Iverson was high man In the twen
ty-bird race on th<s straight bulkhead.
He missed one bird. Webb and Syl
vester were both tied in the last svent,
both scoring Id breaks.

Weak
Stomach.
A weak stomach is most fre- X,
qnehtly caused by the over-
worked and exhausted- nervous
system. .;
The power that runs- -the
stomach is the nerve force sent
to it from the brain through
the nerves. When the nerves
are weak or exhausted the sup-
ply of energy is insufficient
and the action of the stomach "
is impaired, arid results in im-
perfect digestion dyspepsia.
. Dr. Miles' Restorative Nerv-
ine increases nerve force. It
strengthens and builds up nerve
tissue, gives vigor to the nerves
and muscles of the stomach;
this produces a healthy activity.
' Nervine allays the inflamma-
tion, heals the membranes, and
makes the stomach strong and â:
healthy. There is nothing that
. so quickly gives energy to the :
whole system as Restorative ...
Nervine.
"I : can't â¢ say enough for Dr. Miles'/

CELEBRATE EASTER
IN SPLENDOR.
SWEET fAUSIC FOR THE LORD
Congregations at Many of the City's
Churches Largest Seen in Years.
The glory of the risen Lord was ac
claimed by joyous organ peal and
hosaonae of silver throated choirs in
the various churches of the city.
Easter carte In robes of light to chase
away the gloom of Lent and thou
sands of believers, in sanctuaries mad
beautiful -with floral tributes, sent up
their, devotion to the Redeemer whti
lived again. In all the history of th<
city the day of the resurrection vu
never more generally observed; never
were the churches more beautiful with
bloom and never the music more in
spiring. Special programmes were ar-
ranged, as usual, and in some cases
the choirs were augmented with voices
that swelled the volume of lyric
thanksgiving.
The attendance at the larger
churches was so great that hundreds
i ovid not find seats. Though clouds
ed during the forenoon, the wor
shipers among the gentler sex could
f-fraln from wearing the new mil
linery creations that would make them
more lovely in the temples where the
>r was to be acclaimed. There was
â¢ >ual gorgeous scene of feminine
ment at the leading churches.
At St. Mary's Cathedral there were
several policemen present to handle
the crush and on the swÂ«p of stone
steps that lead from the broad avenue
to the doors of the famous sanctuary
far above, hundreds who were too late
tc enter in stood or sat while the
â  s notes rolled out to them or the
posite voice of the choir floated
through the entrance.
At St. Ignatius there was a similar
crush and the other big Catholic
churches turned away their hundreds.
More and more is the glad feast of
Easter growing in the hearts of the
people.
At Grace. Trinity and St. Luke's, the
preat Episcopal houses of worship, the
crush was the same. Fashionable
society paid its devotions and sat duti
and for the most part, doubtless.
â â¢ throughout the beautiful
cc that had been arranged for
â  casion.
The odor of lilies hung heavy in all
the churches and about the altars the
blossoms were gathered together in
clouds of white. Arches and crosses
had been arranged in some places. The
Bermuda Illy was displayed in the
greatest abundance and there were
callas and lilies of the valley, and with
them ferns and palms helped in the
floral ensemble.
At Grace Episcopal Church there
Stood a cross of lilies â the card
readâ by Mrs. Jane Lathrop Stanford
In memory of her dead son, Leland.
For years before her death this philan
thropic woman had been sending each
Easter such a cross as a memorial to
ter one child, who had been taken from
her. nd fend relatives and friends de
termined they would perform for her
the act of love that would have been
hers. Tears sprang to the lashes of
some who had known the good woman
when they read the card.
At St. Paul's the largest congrega
tion that church had ever known gath
ered at the morning Easter services, so
the Rev. Dr. Reilly. the rector, said.
In consequence many were disappoint
ed, but. as at the other big churches, a
large body of the overflow stayed about
outside to hear the music
At St. Dominic's the music pro
gramme was made notable by the pre
sentation for the first time of Ldzst's
coronation mass. It was beautifully
rendered and received the only ap
plause that worshiper* can giveâ the
half-audible murmur or sigh of ap
proval.
Several of the Episcopal Sunday
6chools and other organizations of
young people within the church cele
brated the feast of Easter. Some of
the latter wore their full regalia, and In
mome instances the children of the
Sunday-schools waved banners as they
raised their tender voices in glorifica
tion of their Savior.
Not only in the churches was Easter
observed. Aside from Its acclaim in
the houses of worship. it is gain
ing a firmer hold each year in San
Francisco as a gift day. and each year
the windows of certain stores are
gay with Easter tokens, which are
purchased by thousands, especially as
gifts for children. In the florists*
stores there has been an unusually
large display of the rich lilies of Ber
muda, fresh In the soil, which are also
a popular gift, and in every part of
the city yesterday, and for several
days before, might have been seen de
livery wagons bearing numbers of
these handsome floral tokens.
ST. MARY S FILLED
/ WITH WORSHIPERS
St. Mary's Cathedral never presented
a more splendid or imposing spectacle
than yesterday morning:, when the an
nual solemn Easter services were held
â with all the pomp and splendor that
attends a high mass in the Catholic
church. The immense structure was
thronged with worshipers from every
â¢walk of life, who knelt until Arch
bishop Riordan concluded the services
with the papal benediction.
Long before 11 o'clock the worship
ers began to gather. They filed into
the edifice by hundreds and before the
services began every pew was occu
pied. The doors were blocked with
people eager to grain admittance. They
crowded into the aisles and long lines
extended in each passageway from the
doors half way to the altars. In an
ticipation of a great crush, policemen
had been stationed at the main en
trance to and in each aisle.
Fashion and wealth as well as pov
erty and piety were represented. Fair
women and well-groomed men. whose
very appearance suggested elegance
and ease, offered up Easter prayers.
Then there were wan worshipers,
whose look*s bespoke their station in
ife. kneeling devoutly, forgetful of
tneir troubles while they prayed.
Solemn high mass was celebrated by
A-chbishop George Montgomery- Rev.
P ilip O'Ryan and Rev. W. P. Sulli
van ere the deacons of honor, while
Fa her Prendergast was the assistant
eel brant. Rev. John Hannlgan and
RÂ«\ Charles Ramm were the sub
deaons of the ceremony.
T Â« high altar of the church was a
maÂ« O f beautiful flowers and towering
canieg.-' Evergreens and palms were
plenif v ii 3 - scattered throughout the
sacrej edifice and the place presented
an in->oÃlng sight.
The choir, under the . direction of
Organist Harrison, rendered the work
of the masters during the mass. It
was reinforced by many voices for the
occasion.
Rev. Father Hannigan preached.
He took for his text the gospel of St.
Paul on the resurrection of Christ and j
delivered a sermon that held the at- |
tentlon of the congregation. Father j
Hannigan spoke of the victory achieved 1 i
on Easter â the triumph of Christ over I
his enemies and his glorious resurrec- j
tion after being persecuted. Insulted J
and put to a painful death.
At the conclusion of the mass Arch- |
bishop Riordan ascended the altar and
gave the solemn papal benediction, a
ceremony which is witnessed only a
few times each year in the Catholic ;
churches of the city. Archbishop Rior
dan was assisted by Archbishop Mont- j
gomery and the deacons and sub-dea
cons of the mass.
GREGORIAN CHANT
AT ST. DOMINIC'S
Liszt's wonderful Coronation Mass
was sung at St. Dominic Church with
impressive effect. This is the first
time the historic composition has been
heard here The "credo" is a plain
Gregorian chant of the order, recom
mended by the present Pope Pius X.
While there seemed something archaic
about the chant, it had a ring of the
purely sacred music The voices in
it sing in unison.
The Coronation Mass was first sung
when Emperor Franr Josef was
crowned King of Hungary in 1567.
The gorgeousness of the composition
makes it particularly appropriate as
an Easter mass.
The offertory, "Victimae. paschali
la-ndes." was oompoKd by Dr. H. J.
Stewart, the organist of St. Dominic.
It was a creditable effort and, sung
by Mrs. Benjamin Apple, received the
appreciation it juPtly deserved.
Rev Father Clancy officiated as
celebrant. Father Lewis as deacon and
Father Kelly as sub-deacon. The
Easter sermon was preached by the
Rev. Father Welch.
The main altar and the two side al
tars were tastefully decorated with
lilies, the flowers of the season. Just
above the main altar a large dimly
lighted electric cross was suspended.
The soloists were C. B. Stone, Mrs.
J. McClowsky. R. Elliot and Mrs B.
Apple. They were assisted by a choir
of thirty voices. Mrs. Thomas Nunan
was one of the most well-known of
these. The music was entirely under
the direction of Dr. Stewart, who de
serves great credit for the successful
rendering of such a difficult composi
tion.
LORD CONTROLLED
THE LIFE OF PAUL
The Easter services at St. Stephens
were the most elaborate in many years.
In the memory of the oldest parish
ioner the church never looked prettier.
The chancel and alter were almost hid
den by choice lilies and other beautiful
flowers. The early communion was
largely attended, and the seating ca
pacity of the church was overtaxed at
the 11 oclock service. There was a
larger choir and splendid music. The
Rev. Emmet Bradley, the rector,
preached on the resurrection as a spir
itual fact. "That we may know htm
and the power of his resurrection."
Phil. 3:10.
Mr. Bradley drew a vivid contrast of
the life of Paul, Saul the persecutor
and Paul the apostle and prisoner of
Jesus Christ, and then went on to show
how Jesus and the resurrection were
the controlling and all-absorbing
power in the life of the apostle. He
spoke of the historic Christ, saying, in
part:
As Intelligent men and women, I credit yon
with historic faith in Jesus of Nazareth, and
ret I am bound to tell you that that is not
â¢cough. For many people with historic faith
In Jesus hardly stands the pressure of mod
ern criticism. The Jesus of Emerson and
Martineau and Renau may be a picture of
"wonderful simplicity and graclousness," but
It has not seriously affected the hearts and
lives of the people. Humanity hungers for
something more than a beautiful picture of the
Christ. It thirsts for something more than
a mwÂ« historical fact of twenty centuries ago.
It lores and fears for the living Christ to
day. The ethical movements of onÂ« day and
generation do not accept Jesus Christ. When
confronted with thÂ« stupendous miracle of the
resurrection they say no.
"Far hence he lies.
In a lew Syrian town;
And on his grave with shining eyaa.
The Syrian stars look down."
The evidence the world needs to-day is the
personal vvtdeace. It Is cominÂ» The world
is gaining a new grip on the fundamental
( th* resurrection, and that fact is the
knowledge of Issue and the power of his
r*>-<UTveetion. We must accept that, or, as
â  nest men. reject the gospel altogether. Easter
day and all that It means forbid the con
struction cf a purely human Christ. Man is
proving himself to be master of the forces of
the world, but hÂ« has never been able to
conquer death. Death is the "bow of Ulyssea"
which i*? has never been able to bend. Christ
alÂ«-ne has bent and broken it. It has been
snapped in twain by the deathless power of
the son of God. We imagine in our blindness
that man is a body, and has a soul. If we
know the iÂ»ow*r of the resurrection we shall
reverse that statement. Man Is a soul, and
has a body. The grave is an outrage If we
stop with those words of the commitment sen
tence "Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to
dust " This is not the end. Believing In the
power of fhe resurrection, we may know that
we Mve. Â»nd shall live for ever. Life Is con
tinuous.
At the evening service the church
was filled again with the Sunday
school and the various organizations of
young people, who marched into the
church in full regalia and banners.
The choir of the Maria Kip Orphanage
assisted the regular choir, and the rec
tor addressed the children. One of the
largest offerings in many years was
taken up during the day.
EASTER SABBATH
DAY OF PRAISE
At Simpson Memorial Methodist
Church the pastor, the Rev. James H.
N. Williams, took as his Easter sub
ject: 'The Doxology of the Trium
phant Church."
Text: "Unto him that loveth us. and
loosed us from our sins by his blood;
and he made us to be a kingdom, to
be priests unto his God and Father: to
him be the glory and the dominion for
ever and ever. Amen!" â Revelation,
chapter I, verses 6 and 6.
The pastor said in part:
Saint John, the writer, was on the Island of
Patmoe. . raftering tribulation and banishment
for conscience sake.., But his soul wu aglow
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. MONDAY. APRIL 24, 1905.
with light, for he was "in the spirit on the
Lord's day" and his heart was full with sa
cred emotions, finding an outburst of expren-
Blon in a doxology of praise to Jesus. his
blessed Lord and Savior.
It has been said that Yosemlte' is. the place
of all places where a man can say his prayers.
Easter Sabbath of all days is the (Jay for dox
ologiea of praise and' thanksgiving to God.
With the Inspiration of the great historic fact-
Christ is risen â influencing - our prayers and
songs and sermons, we are ready to join John
in his outburst of doxological praise reyhing
the highest expression of worship: "Unto him
that loveth us. and loosed us from our sins by
his blood, be the glory and the dominion for
ever. ' '
This doxology is ascribed to Jesus, and love
is the source of its inspiration. It Is offered
unto him who was crucified in ignominy and
shame, who died and wan buried, but who is
our risen Lord, alive forever more. He who
was the victim of Calvary by his resurrection
from the dead Is the victor-victim of the ages,
with the keys of death and hell In his hands
and all power in heaven and on earth In his
control. *
The source of its inspiration is love â the
ultimate, as it is the supreme thing. Whether
we go backward to origins or forward to ends,
the greatest thing is- love. The meaning of
the creation and divine providence, of the in
carnation and Christ's great ministry, of Geth
sentane and Calvary, of the first Banter and
Olivet, with the intercession, and the parou
nia to come, is . love. Love accomplishes the
great work of redemption by which we are
loosed from our sins and made, through Christ,
citizens of the kingdom of God. given dignity
and privilege with responsibility and power.
Through the redemption in Jesus the defiled
are cleansed and the slaves at sTn are set free.
This is the cause of rejoicing. By - his death
and resurrection Christ Bets the believers free
from the bondage of sin; and finally he will
free us from the grip of death and the" greed
of the grave, giving us an immortality with
himself In the presence of God. Therefore let
us Join the great host of the redeemed in this
dcxologr of praise to him that loveth us, and
to whom is due the glory; and may he soon
have the dominion that Is universal and eter
nal. Amen!
The music by the choir was of a very
high order and inspired and Kreatly de
lighted the audience, which taxed the
seating capacity of the church.
ANTHEMS SUNG
BY EIGHTY VOICES
At St. Luke's Episcopal Church there
vas an unusual crush. The members
were given seats first, as is the cus
tom. Among the throng held beyond
the portals the following interesting
little notice, written by the Rev.
Burr M. Weeden, the rector, and
printed on blue slips was distributed:
"San Francisco, Easter Day. 1906.
"The rector of St. Luke's Church
greatly regrets the necessity to keep
visitors standing before closed doors.
Easter is a feast of obligation in which
confirmed members of the church fe
required to be at church and tÂ« make
their communion. The Easter eucharist
has a sacred and solemn import to
members of the church. They have
been preparing for it for weeks. The
rector is constrained, therefore, to pro
vide a place for members of the parish
before visitors are seated.
"If the numerous Easter visitors
would also present themselves on thÂ«
other Sundays of the year, the Episco
pal church would at once, with Joyful
ress, enlarge and multiply its places
of worship to accommodate them.
"You are welcome at the church this
morning. We shall do our best to re
ceive you and to furnish you a seat.
We also invite you to come next Sun
day. On any Sunday, except Easter
â ay. you will be received hospitably
4s>d seated without delay.
' "The doors of this church will be
opened at 11 o'clock."
The music was perhaps the finest
ever heard in this church. It was
smoothly and feelingly rendered. The
usual choir, consisting of fifty men and
boys, was assisted by the Woman's
Auxiliary of thirty female voices,
making eighty trained musical throats
pouring forth the melody. Wallace A.
Sabin, organist and choirmaster, di
rected.
Rector Weeden delivered a powerful
discourse on the resurrection.
The floral decorations were unusually
rich and attractive. There were several
memorial arches and crosses.
During the afternoon a class of
twenty adults and children was bap
tized by the Rev. Mr. Weeden, the
ceremony being witnessed by a large
congregation. The rector was assisted
by the Rev. Cecil M. Marraok.
KNIGHTS TEMPLAR
ATTEND SERVICES
The Easter services at the First Con
gregational Church last night were
very impressive. The Golden Gate
Commandery No. 16, Knights Templar,
attended the services. Rev. George C.
Adams, pastor; Sir Philip D. Code,
commander, and Sir William Henry
Jordan officiated.
While the organ prelude, "Marche
aux Flambeaux," was playing, the body
marched into the church and took
seats. The strains of "Onward, Chris
tian Soldier^' burst forth and the con
gregation lolned in the hymn.
Several beautiful sacred selections
were rendered by the choir composed
of: Miss Camille Frank and Mrs. Z. R.
Jenkins, soprani; Mrs. M. E. B. Robin
son and Miss Mabel F. Gordon, con
tralti; Herbert Williams and Sir
Charles L. Goetting, tenori; Sir Louis
A. Larsen and J. C. Hughes, bassi; Sir
Samuel D. Mayer, organist and choir
master.
Rev. George C. Adams preached the
sermon. He used for his theme, "Be
thou faithful unto death and I will give
thee a crown of life." The services
were concluded with Mendelssohn's or
gan postlude, "Priet's March," after
which the Knight 6 Templar marched in
line from the church.
SUNDAY SCHOOLS
OBSERVE THE DAY
In the Episcopal churches there were
Sunday-school festivals in the after
noon and among them St. Luke's
Church Sunday-school had a splendid
representation, numbering about 280.
The children marched up the aisle,
bearing handsome silk Sunday-school
banners and singing a hymn. The Rev.
Mr. Marrack led the children in prayer.
At Trinity Church the Sunday-school
class attended in large number, there
being present about 180. Religious ex
ercises were conducted by the Rev.
Mr. Hume. The children bore flags and
the procession was most imposing. One
flag, the gift of the late Mrs. C. V. S.
Gibbs just before her death, was par
ticularly prized by the class.
Grace Church Sunday-school class
attended also in large numbers, the
Rev. David J. Evans, the rector, con
ducting the service.
The children carried their school
banners and joined heartily in the
service.
GREAT THRONGS
AT GRACE CHURCH
Grace Church, California street, cor
ner of Stockton, was crowded with
worshipers long before the 11 o'clock
service. Even at holy communion at
8 o'clock in the morning the attendance
was exceptionally large.
The handsome church was beauti

fully decorated with flowers and ever
greens, one prominent floral gift at
the foot of the chancel coming in the
name of the late beloved Mrs. Jane
Lathrop Stanford, who, ever since the
death of her son, Leland. had sent to
Grace Church on Easter Sunday a
cross composed of most exquisite white
flowers.
It is evidently the intention of mem
bers of the family to conform to the
fond wish of the lamented lady and
continue the contribution of the great
floral cross, as she would have done
had she been spared. The cross was
composed of Bermuda lilies, lilies of
the valley, carnations and maiden
hair fern. It arrived at Grace Church
at 7 o'clock in the morning and was
placed a^ the , chancel by faithful
hands.
The sermon by the Rev. David J.
Evans was explanatory of the day and
urgent and lucid in explanation of the
resurrection.
The music was rendered by the great
choir which has been identified with
Grace Church for many years under
the direction of William H. Holt.
The anthem, "Rejoice This Hob-
Easter Morn," by Dressier, was given
in a beautiful manner, the male voices
blending with extraordinary effect.
The Gloria in G (Dr. Barnet) and the
offertory, "If Ye Then Be Risen," were
also perfectly rendered.
In the evening the church was again
filled and, like in the morning, there
were many unable to gain admission to
the service.
In the evening there was another
large attendance at Grace Church, in
cluding numerous members of the
Sons of St. George.
As in the morning, the services were
conducted by the Rev. David
Evans, who preached an eloquent ser
mon, appropriate to the day. The full
choir was present and gave a splendid
rendition of the grand sacred numbers.

MINNESOTA RABBITS
RACE AGAJVST TRAINS
Jacks Specially Taught Said to Be

CROOKSTON, Minn., April 23. â
Training jackrabbits to race against a
train is the latest fad of Norwood
Davies. managing editor of the
Crookaton Times. While on a train
last summer he saw a large jackrabbit
running even with the cars and the
idea of training jacks for racing pur
poses presented itself. Since then he
has been gathering likely and large
specimens "and has been devoting
much of his time to training them.
He now has two Jackrabbits trained
so they obey his commands fairly well
and every day when he has time he
takes them out and races them
against incoming trains. The speed
of these anim^ia is remarkable. 9o
far it has been impossible to accurate
ly time them, but it is claimed that
they can negotiate a mile in a minute.
As the train approaches the animals
become restless and nervous and prance
about much like running horses at the
start of a race. Up to the present time
the rabbits have only been .trained to
run when the train is approaching, but
Davies anticipates racing the Jacks
apainst horses, bicycles and motor
cars.

TRADE CONDITIONS MORE UNSETTLED.
TRADE conditions were more unsettled last week. The monotony
of the past month was broken and reports from the different
mercantile, financial and agricultural Jines showed considerable
irregularity. Jn this respect the situation was less favorable than it
has been of late, though outside of Wall street there were no adverse
indications. The clearings of the country exhibited the very large
gain of 654 per cent over the corresponding week last year and
mounted to the high aggregate of $3,154,000,000, but a great deal of
ttttt gain was directly assignable to New York, where the sudden
excitement and large transactions on the Stock Exchange gave thy
city an apparent trade gain of 97.3 per cent and aggregate clearings
of about $2,100,000,000. Hence these figures, apparently so favor
able, were not indicative of any such increase in trade, or any such
volume of legitimate business.
But outside of Xew York the figures made a fine showing. Prac
tically the whole country showed continued expansion in business,
the important trade centers rolling up heavy gains, such as 27.6 at
Boston. 28.8 at Philadelphia. 23.7 at Pittsburgh 54.8 at San Fran
cisco, and so on. San Francisco and the Pacific Coast are sending
in the very best commercial reports in the country at present, Brad
ftreetÂ« remarking that the outlook on this coast is without a flaw.
Los Angeles reports an increase of 36.7. Spokane 27.8, Seattle 45.4.
and so on. There is no stock market speculation at any of these
points to artificially inflate the clearings, as at New York, Chicago.
Koston and other large Eastern centers, hence they indicate just so
much expansion in actual commercial business.
The features of the week were the collapse of the great May
\Â« heat deal at Chicago and the violent and disagreeable decline in
stocks at New York. The former was due to the inability of those
v ho tried to corner May wheat to further struggle under their bur
den, and the latter to half a dozen causes, theoretical or definitely
known, such as the court decision in the Northern Securities case,
the Equitable Insurance affair, the throwing upon the market of
large lines of stocks for purposes of liquidation, the critical naval
situation in Asiatic waters, the collapse of the Chicago wheat deal.
the unloading of American stocks by London, the growing feeling
that stocks had soared too high for safety, and the sharp rise in call
money from 3 !/ 2 to 6*/> per cent, though the latter was rather an ef
fect than a cause. These conditions were sufficient to break any
stock market. The situation was more or less blind, however, so
much so that keen operators in Wall street wired out to their corre
spondents all over the country the confession that they really M dW
not know what was the matter with the market." Anyhow, it went
(i-nvn, and very sharply, too. and closed Thursday afternoon con
fused and feverish.
In addition to these two unfavorable features, the weather was
cold and very rainy and adverse to trade activity. It was 'noted that
the tendency in prices had taken a downward turn and that some
lines, previously very active, were showing quieter conditions. This
was particularly the case wi*h iron and steel, the demand for pig
and other iron being less pronounced. The manufacturing interests
as a rule, however, continued to send in cheerful reports, the textile
and footwear factories reporting their mills running on full time,
with no serious labor difficulties. The railroad earnings thus far
reported for April show a gain of 10.2 per cent over last year. The
failures for the week were 200. against 241 in 1904. The fall de- j
mand for general merchandise is much better than anticipated, and
collections, previously good, are improving. Lumber and other
building materials are in active demand, as are also agricultural im- i
plements. The condition of the winter wheat crop, as shown by
Government and private reports, is most excellent and considerably
above the average of recent years, presaging a very large crop, thougti j
the cold and rainy weather has interfered with spring wheat and the |
seeding of oats throughout the West
Thus it will be seen that trade conditions are again becoming
irregudar. The net showing, however, is good. Parts of the coun
try are unsettled, but taking the situation as a whole it exhibits
nothing of a character to create uneasiness. With the Chicago and
New York speculative disorders rectified the whole situation will
probably resume that tranquillity which characterized it for many ;
weeks.
THE FARMER THAT FARMS.
AT the meeting: of the Sacramento Valley Improvement Asso
ciation, its policy was declared to be the oneov.i agement of
paying industries, and the avoidance of inducing any one to
come to California upon false pretenses. The Call's views upon small
land holding and the encouragement of the farmer who farms were
indorsed in a speech made by Mr. Walton of Sutter County, who
that a colony from Dakota located on ten and twelve acre tracts
in his county in 180,2. and had prospered exceedingly. At Gridley
>ple went into Â«mall dairying and soon a creamery had to be built
to take their product and they are prospering. He believed in en
couraging the nnall farmer, smajl fruit grower and small dairyman.
That is the right policy. "Many a little makes a mickle" is the
I Scotch saying. This State needs families settled on such hold
| of good land as they can take care of. who will attend to their
r, \\ <>rk and their own business, do variety farming and have
â¢nothing to sell every month in the year. When this comes about,
proof will appear that a forty-acre farm in California produces
>re income than a quarter section farm in the Eastern States. That
it the demonstration California" needs.
We have had the da* of big things and they were good in their
toe. But we want no more 50.000-acre wheat fields. We want in
stead 50.000 small farms, from 20 acres to 80. That is enough to
keep one family busy and to earn a good living and produce an an
nual surplus of cash. Among the achievements of the Sacramento
Valley Improvement Association it i? able to boast, with justifiable
pride, the negotiation of a contract for subdivision and sale of the
Glettn ranch, the largest wheat farm on earth. It comprised ong
iraliv rx5.000 acre>. and now is being cut up into small farms for
1 ariet\ farming. Let the association go on in good work of that
kind and the Sacramento Valley will soon be the most densely popu
lated part of the State.

THE RAREBIT FIEND
IT WAS ONLY A DREAM
VOICES OF AMERICAN WOMEN
NOTHING adds more to womanly charm than a voice
both low and sweet. Shakespeare put the fact into
verse, but it had been said before him â and it will
continue to be said as long as woman continues to be
mans ide^l.
Yet it is the only too solemn fact that American
women have almost the most disagreeable voices in the
world. It is not entirely their fault. Our ancestors from
the north of England, where that sort of voicf also pre
vails, are responsible Cor it. and the climate hereabouts,
especially in the North, has something to do with it.
Nevertheless, few days pass in which a Bensatfve per
son does not meet some woman, either in a public place
or as a private acquaintance, whose mode of speech re
minds him of nothing so much as that old German tale
of the selfish sister from whose mouth toads leaped when
ever she spoke. If a woman is not remarkably fair to
look upon, it is certainly sorrily that she should be fair
to listen to; if she is good to look at. what a double pity
that her tongue and your ears should give the lie to your
eys and her face! ,
The first thing that strikes Americans traveling in
foreign parts is the prettiness of foreign speech; the first
&50.000 FEATHER.
On the apex of the Prince of Wales'
crown, which he wears on special oc
, casions, is a curious feather, or rather
a tuft of periwak feathers, the top of
which is adorned with a gold thread.
This feather is said to be worth
$50,000, and has the distinction of be
, ing the only one of its kind in the
world. It took twenty years to pro
cure it, and it caused the death of
more than a dozen hunters. The rea
son the pursuit of the periwak is so
dangerous is because it inhabits the
jungles and other haunts of tigers.

You have the cart before the horse.
' young man. Your experience does not
justify your belief, but your belief haa
resulted in your experience.
The secret of your failure lies in the
very attitude of mind you confess to
have hpld ail your life â that some Deo
pie are cut out for success and others
are not. The fear that you were cut
on the failure pattern has made its im

were conscious of it or not. This fear,
this uncertainty, has entered into the
very fiber of your thinking until it has
become a part of you.
No man who does not definitely and
heartily believe success is for him can
hope to win success. Prosperity does
not respond to any but an absolutely
dauntless demand.
'If things would only change." is the
cry of the soul unacquainted with its
God-given birthright to rule its own,
kingdom. You as a living, thinking \
being endowed with intelligence from your Creator, are placed In this worM
to rule, not to be ruled.
Conditions will never change for you until you have changed your con
cept of yourself â until you realize that you have power to shape circum
stances.
When you have once gained this idea of yourself, when you have out
yourself right with your environment, you will find that you are no lonsrer
the child of circUmÃtance, a punnet of fate. You will be the governing fa<
tor and "things" will fall into line, will "come your way" in obedience I
decree.
You have been in a thought atmosphere of failure so long that you have
begun to believe yourself a born failure. Others think so, too. don't they '
Of course. How could they help it. when you are carrying that conscious

Do you know that people can feel your thoughts just as distinctly as
they can perceive the kind of clothes you wearjand the type of featu:

He may not know why he turns you away, but the faculty he calls his judg

All your effort on the physical plane will avail little unless backed r
dynamic force of your belief in success for yourself. Your minc^ must h*Â»
charged with this electric certainty, if you would compel the interest of
others.
To make things come your way. break off definitely and forever from the
old thought currents of failure. Take a brand new mental attitude. TpII your
self daily that you are cut out for success, that you expect success and mean
to have it. Then go to work. Keep on making efforts. "Faith without
works is dead," you know. Be 2lad you have a chance to exercise both mind
and body. It takes the two kinds of effort to make success.
If you are doing something you feel you are not fitted to 80. leave it and
make a new start in something more congenial. But first get the right idea
about yourself as a success masnet. Conditions are plastic to your thought.

Of the Roekford Morning: Star.
"About seven years ago I ceased
drinking coffee to give your Postum
a trial.
'1 had suffered acutely from various
forms of indigestion and my stomach
had become so disordered as to repel
almost every sort of substantial food.
My general health was bad. At close
intervals I would suffer severe attacks,
which confined me in bed for a week
or more. Soon after changing from
toffee to Postum the indigestion abated
and in a short time ceased entirely. I
have continued the daily use of your
excellent Food Coffee and assure you
most cordially that I am indebted 10
you for the relief it has brought CM.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 24, 1905.
MISSION DOLORES OBJECT
LESSON IN HISTORY
Clubwomen Unite With Landmarks League
in Effort to Have Church Open.
PETITION IS TO BE SOON PRESENTED
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
Quite the most vital issue now before
the clubwomen of the city â those inter
ested in live Issues â Is the opening of
Mission Dolores to the people.
That Father Brennan, the venerable
pastor of the old mission, will accede
to the request of the Landmarks
League, supported by the California
Promotion Committee, the California
Club, the Daughters of California Pio
neers and the Outdoor Art League, is
fully believed, when ample assurance is
given him that the beloved sanctuary
will be properh* sentineled and safe
guarded from vandals.
This will be assured him by the
Landmazks League, which will assume
the payment of a competent caretaker
of the old church. Funds for this pur
pose are now offered the league, Frank
J. Sullivan leading with a proffered do
nation of $100â this without solicitation.
That's patriotism.
During the last two years funds have
been collected by Miss Nora Fennell
for the purpose of restoring the inte
rior of the church, and disbursed by
her seemingly to excellent purposes â
for the work done has been done intel
ligently and artistically, much of it by
her brother. C. E. Fennell.
The work of restoration will in no
way be interfered with by the opening
up of the church â which ethically Is
the possession of all San Francisco,
within whose sacred precincts the city
was nurtured and from which it has
derived its beautiful name â from St.
Francis de Assisi. the Good.
Likewise will all due credit be given
to those good people who are working
for the restoration of the mission
there seeming to be a lurking suspicion
that the Landmarks League is seeking
"credit" â that stupidest of all motives
in the pursuit of public work. Nay!
Nay!
The Landmarks League is in busi
ness solely and only to safeguard and
give publicity to landmarks, and it
doesn't care a fig who gets the credit,
so long as the end is accomplished.
The league wants the mission open
at certain periods of the day â and
every day â as are all the other mis
sionÃ in the State. The details of the
opening are of small importance â free
access being the one thing sought.
It wants the mission open, so tour
ists niny visit the spot where Francisco
Palou planted the cross in 17 76.
It wants it open so that the school
children may visit it and learn there
from the history of their city and of
their State â much of which germinat
ed in this hallowed spot.
It is one of the criminal omissions
of our school course that the history
of San Francisco and of California â
the latter the most fascinating history
in America â has, until the last few
years, been passed over as a thing of
small import.
Just now a great cry is sweeping
over the country about civic duty.
Now, the basis of civic duty is civic
pride: the basis of civic pride is pride
of history â of ancestry. Therefore, if
we ho^e to incubate in our children a
sense of civic duty, let us implant in
them a civic pride by teaching them
the history of their city and their
State.
And as an object lesson. Mission
Dolores must be open â it speaks to
the imagination of children's minds.
They people it again with neophytes
at prayer; they plant the patio with
palms and pomegranates: they see the
brown-rohen" friars among their chil
dren, preaching and teaching. All this
i=> history and poetry, both of which
are paths to civic virtue.
Therefore it is hoped that when
Congressman Joseph R. Knowland,
president of the Landmarks League,
presents his petition to Father Bren
nan during the week it will be readily
TABLES TURNED
IN WHEAT DEAL
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, April 23.â Now that the
great May wheat corner has gone to
smash and all that remains is the
somewhat costly process of burvine the
corpse, interest is turning to the July
proposition. In the last fatal hours of
the May deal, John W. Gates was
forced to make tertns with Armour to
minimize the losses. It is held by close
observers that Gates is now In a posi
tion to make things highly interesting
for Armour and drive him to terms In
the July deal.
Armour Is long on July wheat, lust
how long no one but himself knows,
but within a week or two he has taken
on 10,000,000 or 12,000,000 bushels at an
average price of 87Vfe cents. The mice
now hovers around this figure. CroD
conditions are ideal and with no set
back, a bumper crop will bepin to pour j
in before the end of July. It Is be- ,
lieved the supply of wheat will drive
the price to 75 cents or lower. All of
the Texas crop and Kansas hard winter
wheat can be put into Chieaeo before
the end of July. Other States in the
Southern territory will contribute
largely to the supply and here is the
hook upon which G^ites can hansr his
proposition to Armour to walk ud and
make terms.
It is supposed that Gates still has at
least 10,000,000 bushels of May wheat.
It would be better to sell this to Armour
at 88 or 87 cents now than to hold It.
pay elevator charges and insurance and
take the chances of bumper crops and
75 cents or less inside of thirteen weeks.
It is held that the tables have been
turned and that Gates \b now in a po
sition to dictate terms. Prospects for
a good wheat crop were never better.
Weather conditions have been perfect
and dispatches from Kentucky and
other States further South say the
stand of winter wheat is superb. In
States further north the plant is not
far enough advanced to be in danerer
of frost.
The effect on the digestive organs
after using Lash's Kidney and Liver
Bitters is truly wonderful. â¢

VESSEL ON OVERDUE
LIST COMES TO PORT
VERBENA HAS ROUGH VOYAGE
Gales, Storms and Calms Cause Lime
juicer to Make Long Passage.
The overdue British ship Verbena
came into port late Saturday nijsht. 185
days from Liverpool. Captain Lee re
ports that the long passage was due to
a succession of gales and calms. She
had been listed among the overdues
at 7 per cent.
The Verbena left Liverpool October
19, 1904, and at first ran into liKht
variable winds and very poor northeast
trades. She lost them in 20 decrees
north. She crossed the equator when
forty-four days out in 27 decrees west.
She was then carried by the southeast
trade winds to 23 degrees aouth. When
off the River Platte she ran into strong
head winds. For three weeks the ves
sel was buffeted about by winds and
waves, and when the storm subsided
it was found that no headway had been
made during that period.
The weather then moderated some
what, although the seas were running
high. On January 14 the Verbena
passed Staten Island. She was then
87 days out.
On January 17, while the vessel was
hove to, owing to heavy gales and
high seas, a great sea came on board
and filled the lee side of the deck. It
atruck the vessel with tremendous force
and almost threw her on her beam
ends. In its furious onslaught the
waves caught Ordinary' Seaman James
Putt and carried him overboard.
Everything was done to save the man's
life, but without avail. The seas at
this time were lashed into a seething
From that time on the ship ran into
a continuation of westerly gales until
she reached 50 degrees south. 86 desrrees
west. She was then 119 days out.
From that point to the equator she
had favorable weather and crossed in
113 degrees west when 152 days out.
Next followed a succession of indif
ferent northeast trade winds which
were lost in 21 degrees north. After
that the vessel encountered calms and
light, variable winds until she reached
port.
The Verbena brings a cars:o of gen
eral merchandise to J. D. Spreckels &
Bros. Company.
Record for Quick Dispatch.
The American bark St. Katharine, Captain
Saunders, has made a* record for quick dis
patch. She came into this port from Hono
lulu on April 15 with 30.653 bags of sugar.
These were discharged and a cargo of general
merchandise was taken aboard. Yesterday tne
vessel sailed for the islands again. She was
in port eight days. Welch & Co. are her
asents here.

WARNER SCORES
OVER CUTLER
The class singles tennis tournament
commenced at the California Club last
Sunday was completed yesterday. The
finals of the third and fourth classes
were played and resulted in victories
for Moulten Warner and Ed Bacon.
The former won third class honors,
while the latter proved his supremacy
in the baby class.
Warner's opponent was George Cut
ler. The latter proved no match for
his stronger and older adversary-. Cut
ler won a set, but the other three were
annexed by Warner quite easily. Tht
score in Warner's favor was 6-1. 6-2.
4-6, â¬-1.
The fourth class match was too one
sided to be interesting. Bacon proved
much too strong for Daniel Volkmann
and won in straight sets, 6-4. 6-2. 6-1.
Some good practice ' matches were
played, especially â¢ in doubles. Georee
Janes and Carl Gardner joined forces
for the first time and proved a strong
combination. They won three sets out
of four from Frank Mitchell and Sid
ney Salisbury. Janes is playing an
unusually strong game, and if Gardner
could improve his overhead work they
would make a strong team.' Salisbury
played a good game, as â  usual, but
Mitchell was rather unsteady. The
score was 6-3. 6-2, 1-6, 6-2. â 'â "-â ;'*
Another good doubles match was
that in which George Busch, and Grant
Smith defeated. Melville Long and Har
old Gabriel. The latter are two of the
cleverest youngsters in the city, but
their more experienced opponents were
much too strong for them. Busch
drove with remarkable precision and
seemed to get the balls just out of his
opponents' reach. The score was 6-3.
6-3, 2-6. ' ilSlNMJiroPfll^
After winning the fourth class Ed
Bacon took on W. G. Knowlton. one of
the beet men in the third class. Bacon
won the first set from the "iron man."
but the latter realizing he had a hard
man to beat, got to work in the next
two sets and won them. both. The
score 4-6, 6-4, 6-3.; -' â¢ '
Warner had no difficulty in beating
Spencer Grant. 6-1. The latter was
out of practice.. - ' / â . ; '
There was nothing scheduled at the
park yesterday, the day being devoted
to practice. Herbert Schmidt and
Harry Rolfe of the California ? Club
and Clarence Griffin and Charles Folev
of the Golden Gate Club furnished 'a
good exhibition: The public courts
players took ; threeÂ» sets, all â of : which
were close. The score,' 8-6. 7-5. 6-4.

VIENNA, April 2H.~~ Carl Konlsak, who was
leader of the Austrian band at the St. L<ouls
Exposition last year, was accidentally killed
in trying to board a railway train at Baden,
near Vienna, to-day.
The San Francisco and Talaeov
teams played an exhibition match of
lacrosse on the Presidio athletic
grounds yesterday afternoon, the ball
being faced soon ler 2 o'clock. Two
quarters of twer.., minutes each were
played, the San Francisco men scorine
6 goals to the Talagoos' 2. The referee
was C. H. Minto of the Olympic La
crosse Club. Though the San Fran
cisco team played two men short, their
passing was better than that of their
opponents, and O'Brien was accurate
in shooting for goal.
The game was rough, several of the
players carrying away marks of the
conflict. At 3:20 o'clock the football
teams came out and the lacrosse men
rested. During the intermission at
4:20 the lacrosse teams walked upon the
ground and, began to play, but after
much argument were persuaded to
Withdraw, it being explained that the
football game was the final and decid
ing match of the season, while the la
crosse game was merely for purposes
of practice and exhibition. The teams
lined up as follows:

FREEPORT IN
HIS BEST FORM
Ingleside Coursing Park reopened
yesterday, after being closed for sev
eral weeks. The coursing was of a
poor quality, as the hares from Ore
gon afforded miserable trials. The
stake waj3 left unfinished, owing to the
scarcity of hares. Freeport and False
Alarm were the two dogs left to com
pete in the deciding course.
The attendance was small, probably
due to the cold weather which pre
vailed. Fluky hares were the cause of
numerous upsets during the day. Many
of the favorites went out and led sev
eral lengths only to have the hares
double back, killing whatever chance
the public choice had. Freeport would
undoubtedly have captured first money
had the final been run. He won his
previous trials without having to ex
tend himself. False alarm showed
good form. Following are the day's

INDIES DEFEAT
HORNET ELEVEN
The Independents beat the Oakland
Hornets three goals to two in the
final round for the California Asso
ciation Football Union cup yesterday
on the Presidio athletic grounds. The
game was keenly fought from start
to hnish and was watched with great
interest by a large number of enthusi
astic spectators. Arthur Robinson was
referee and gave general satisfaction
by his quickness and decision. The
ball was kicked off at 3:40 p. m. and
after a few minutes' play the Oakland
Hornets secured a goal.
About half an hour later P. Fay
scored for the Independents, making
the game all even. Then Macartney,
the Hornet outside left, after a fine
run, centered the ball well and
Chambers put it into goal. When the
whistle sounded for half time the score
stood: Oakland Hornets two goals,
Independents one goal.
After some vigorous bacJc and forth
play after intermission one of the
Dwyer brothers headed the ball clev
erly into the Hornet goal, but the score
was not allowed. A little later Ball
man scored for the Independents,
making the record read "two all."
Though the Hornets played their hard
est, Macartney and Chambers doing
some excellent work, they were unable
to score. About eight minutes before
the call of time Ballman made another
goal for the Independents. At the final
whistle the score' read: Independents
three goals, Hornets two goals.
Their victory is the more creditable
to the Independents, inasmuch as they
played without Jones and Duncanson,
two of their strongest men. The Inde
pendent goalkeeper, Antrobus, ren
reded most valuable service, sa%*ing
some dangerous shorts. For the
Hornets Elliott did good work and
Barrett made some excellent saves.
The teams lined up as follows:

CHICAGO RACING SITUATION
IN A TANGLED CONDITION
Season Is to Open Next Saturday at
Worth, but the Authorities
May Interfere.
CHICAGO, April 23. â According to
the race track\ programme â which,
however, Is considerably blurred â
raclrtg around Chicago is to begin
next Saturday at Worth course.
Not for years has the opening been
regarded with so much apathy. Al
though only a few days intervene
before the opening turf enthusiasts do
not feel sure they will have a chance
at their favorite sport. The managers
of Worth track are going ahead with
their arrangements, but they admit
they are not sure they will be allowed
to race.
"War" has an additional depressing
effect on the situation. Not one racing
fan in a dozen cares whether the West
ern Jockey Club enforces its so-called
outlaw rule at Worth, but all of them
are wondering whether John Condon
will conspire secretly against the meet
ing or whether the Harlem man may
not proceed against the track in* the
courts by injunction. He might do this
effectually if he chose, as he owns
quite a share of stock in the Worth
Club and it has jumped from the West
ern Jockey Club against his counsel.
Either proceeding x#mld probably shut
the gates at Worth, even if there were
no interference from the Cook County
authorities.

The Commuters went right down the
line yesterday and took a double fall
out of Uncle's collection of baseball
stars. They managed to get away
with the first game without much ef
fort, but they needed everything they
had in order to win the last which
was all but served up to Uncle in a
ninth spasm finish that savored of the
proverbial Garrison brand. Scores:
Morning â Oakland 4. San Francisco
1 : afternoon â Oakland t. San Fran
cisco 2.
Good fast baseball won both games
for the Commuters. They wielded
their bats hard when men were ott the
basÂ«s and they fielded fast enough to
keep the Seals away from the rubber.
San Francisco outhit the Oaks in both
struggles, but intead of walloping the
ball with men on the bases, they
always managed to hit seemingly for
the fun of hitting.
The score was 3 to 2 in favor of old
Rip's kids when the Seals got read*
to take a last wallop at the floaters
of Ham Iberg. Wheeler was com
missioned to use the club Instead of
Gochnauer and he worked Ham for a
pass. Shea advanced Georgie with
an infield out and when Waldron
beat out a bunt, it looked good, but
when Spencer walked and completed
a full house, the fans were ready to
throw their bonnets away.
It was up to Ike Walters, but Ikey
was not there. The best he had was
a fly which Kruger grabbed with one
mitt and returned perfectly to the
plate. Byrnes whipped the ball to
second and came pretty near catch
ing Waldron off the sack. Hilde
brand, the last hope, made it good
night by dispatching a grounder to
Devereaux, which the red lad immedi
ately consumed and winged perfectly
to first.
Brick Devereaux and Van Haltren
batted in Oakland's runs. Their
sticking was great and they made good
time traveling around the sacks. Ham
Iberg never allowed the Seals to
bunch any hits on him.
Henley pitched a steady game, but
his judgment in the handling of bunta
was not at all like big league art. He
allowed Devereaux to reach third on
him in round three after Byrnes had
bunted. Byrnes stole promptly and
both men came in on Van Haltren's
double. This little mistake of Hen
ley's let the Commuters get their win
ning run. The score:

DOUBLE HEADER FOR TACOMA
Tigers Outfield and Outbat the Visitors
in Both Their Contests.
TACOMA, April 23. â To-day's
double header proved easy for the
champions. In the morning Keefe
was almost Invincible. In the ninth
James and Kane singled while Keefe
threw in a pass. Seattle's only chance
to score was spoiled by a clever double
play, Keefe to Graham and Nordyke.
Roach was effective except in the
third, when Doyle hit for two sacks,
followed by singles by Sheehan. Nor
dyke and Casey, which scored four.
In the afternoon the contest started
with even honors, but in the fifth Wil
liams lost control. With one down,
he passed Sheehan. Eagan and Casey.
Kane and Williams contributed errors
which with a passed ball and Mc
laughlin's single brought in four.
The Seattle team then went to pieces.
Tacoma adding three on a combina
tion of hits and errors. Pitapatrick

ROWDY BASEBALL AT PORTLAVD
Pitcher Goodwin Tries to Hit Mana
ger McCreedie With the Ball. * " -1;
PORTLAND. April 23.â Ange
les took to-day's game in thÂ« twelfth .
inning by a score of 5 to 2. There
were all sorts of baseball thrown into
these twelve â  Innings â baseball,
sinful miscues. wrangling and displays
of bad temper that should not be Â«
tossed into any ball game. Manager c
McCreedie. while standing on the plate
disputing Umpire Klopf 's decision, f
had a ball thrown directly at his head .
by Pitcher Goodwin. It was a vicious
and rowdy act. For his display of
temper . Goodwin was fined 15 and
was driven from the game. This and
an error by Schaffey at a critical time
of the game, when Bert .Jones virtu- -
ally had them shut out 1 to 0, -vfere"

MAKES ARREST
WHILE DRUNK
Because Charles "West would not buy
him a drink Policeman Thomas C.
Dowd placed him under arrest and at
tempted to book him at the Southern
Station. As Dowd was considerably
under the influence of liquor. Captain
Spillane released West immediately
and ordered the bibulous guardian of
the peace thrown into a cell. He was
charged with Gonduct unbecoming an
officer and drunkenness. His star was
taken from him.
Though Dowd has only been on the
force since last June, he has been
before the Commissioners three times
and been fined $300 in all for various
offenses. This last escapade will prob
ably result in his dismissal.
Dowd had been hanging around the
saloon at 1300 Folsom street all morn
ing in plain clothes. He had been
drinking heavily when Charles West
came into the place.
"Say, you've got to buy me a drink,"
Baid the policeman.
"You've had enough now, whoever
you are," retorted West.
"I'll show you who I am," asserted
Dowd. exposing his star. "I'm a police
man. I arrest you for disturbing the
peace and refusing to buy. You come
'long or I'll handcuff you."
Policeman and prisoner walked to
the Southern Station. West had to
guide his captor's rebellious footsteps
most of the time and hold him up.
When they reached the Southern
Station Captain Spillane immediately
ordered the intoxicated policeman ar
rested and stripped of his star.

POLICE PLACE ANOTHER
SUSPECT BEHIND BARS
John Sknrs Is Thought to Know
Something of the Bruitt Saloon
Holdup.
Detective Tom Ryan has arrested
another suÃpect in the case of the
saloon holdup at Brannan and Second
streets. The oolice have little or no
evidence to connect this man with the
holdup, but his movements and ac
tions previously to the night of the
crime make him a desirable prisoner
until the police advance further with
their investigation.
The suspect Is John Skurs, 21 years
of age, with a long criminal record.
He resides in the neighborhood of
where the holdup occurred and was
with the gang that shot Policeman
Fabian Calahan during the teamsters'
strike a few years ago. Skurs has
been arrested on many occasions for
thefts and he is regarded as a bay
pirate.
What caused Skurs' arrest waa his
connection with a holdup in South
Park two weeks ago, when he stood up
Matthew La, Strange, a nephew of the
murdered man. Skurs admits this,
but says he did it for fun. The police
are of a different opinion. Skurs and
La Strange are acquainted with each
other and it is probable that when
Skurs found who his victim was he
became frightened and laughed the
matter off. Skurs says he was home
when Riley was killed. He, however,
has been seen several times in the
neighborhood of the saloon since
then. *

FOG CREATES HAVOC WITH
DAINTY EASTER BOXXETS
There were plenty of Easter bonnets
and Easter finery of all sorts in the
Park yesterday until late in the after
noon When a heavy 'fog , almost a
Scotch mist, rolled 1 over the big pleas
ure grounds. Then the new feathers
assumed a look of anguish and curls
grew scraggy. There was a free for
all race from the bandstand to' the
cars. . â¢ - .-. -â - : . .'
Among those who took the air was
the damsel with the green hat. When
the fog. like a. gentle rain, dampened
the bonnet the color hegan to run so
did the girl. But the color had a
start and little green rivulots began
to trickle down her face. She made
a fatal mistake. She tried to mop her
changing complexion with a handker
chief. By this time *a red feather on
the headgear began to melt and the
lady of the verdant bonnet had a face
like a tinted. Easter etc

UNKNOWN YOUTH
ENDS HIS LIFE
Goes to Top of Strawberry
Hill. Golden Gate Park, and
Swallows Potion of Opium
IS FOUND UNCONSCIOUS
Leaves Note Asking That No
Step Be Taken to Learn
Identity of His People
A young man whose identity is un
known committed suicide at the top of
Strawberry Hill, Golden Gate Park,
yesterday. He was found In an un
conscious condition by a park police
man and was removed to the Park
Emergency Hospital, where he died.
Dr. Pinkham expressed the opinion
that death was caused by opium
poison. The stomach will be sent to
the City Chemist for analysis.
Deputy Coroner Meehan took charge
of the body and removed it to the
Morgue. It is that of a young man
about five feet seven inches tall, very
dark hair, smooth face, evidently a
Mexican. He wore a black cheviot suit
and hie shoes were worn through at the
soles. His collar and shirt had the
laundry mark "R 60." In the pockets
were found an empty purse, a 1-cent
piece, a Mexican cent piece and a Ger
man 10 pfennige piece. There were also
a silk handkerchief bearing the letter
"R," a cheap pair of sleeve links and
four small shells.
In a note book he had written in
pencil: "I am 22 years old January 27,
1905. S. T. D." On another leaf was
written: "Please do not try to find my
people, for I don't want them to know.
I did it myself and it is nobody's busi
ness why." On another leaf he had
started on with "on the," but stopped
and wrote below, "Once I had a sweet
heart, noble, brave and true, but she
is dead." The notebook bears the stamp
of "John D. Gray, druggist, 476 Main
street, Stockton-"

BEAM BREAKS
AND ROOF FALLS
Peculiar Accident in the
Two-Story Building at
309 Washington Street
PEOPLE ABE STAETLED
One of the Employes Goes
From Structure Just a Few
Minutes Before Collapse
People In the vicinity of Washington
and Front streets were startled yester
day afternoon by a crash as if a build
ing had collapsed. Policeman Silver
was notified and after making an in
vestigation he discovered that the roof
of a two-story building at 309 Wash
ington street, occupied by Gray & Bar
bieri, fruit and commission merchants,
had given way.
It is an old frame structure with a
heavy roof. The collapse was caused
by the bending of the center beam of
the second floor. It fell to the first
floor and one end struck the larere
scales, bending the stanchions. The
other end of the beam was left daneline
in the air. The breaking of the beam
loosened the supports of the roof, which
fell with a crash upon the second floor.
The weight of the roof upon this floor
made the front wall of the building
bulge out over the siedwalk.
Policeman Silver at once notified
Engine Company No. 1 of the Fire De
partment at 419 Pacific street, and by
instructions of the District Engineer a
board fence was erected in front of
the building to insure the safety of
pedestrians, as it was thought that at
any moment the whole structure would
collapse. The woodwork is rotten from
old age, and the wonder is that the
building did not give wrfy years ago.
One of the employes had been work-
Ing in the store yesterday morning, and
Policeman Smith saw him leave a few
minutes before the noon hour. If the
collapse had occurred during business
hours on a week day it. is probable that
there would have been a loss of life.

ORPHEUM SHOW
IS VERY FUNNY
"Christmas on Blackwells
Island" Is Amusing and
Full of Strong Singing
SKETCH BYCALIFOENIAN
Clay 31. Greene Wrote It for
Lamb's Club of New York,
but It Will Go Anywhere
Those that know their Orpheum as,
they should Â«aw "Christmas on Black
wells Island" last week. I saw It my
self last night and am sorry to have
gons without it for seven days. One
has heard a good deal of the Lambs'
Club Gambols, the "high jinks" of the
actor folk of New York. To these frol
ics the players, as the painters and
poetn here to the Bohemian Club jinks,
bring their best and brightest. "Christ
mas on Blackwells Island" was written
for a "gambol" by Clay M. Greene.
Patriotism impels one to mention that
the said Greene, before he knew enough
to be a "Lamb" â or anything else â was
a Californian. It is greatly to our
credit. The sketch aforesaid is one of
the brightest, and moreover one of the
best sung and handled generally of any
seen here of late.
There is a good, sounding "Adeste
Fideles" going on in male voices before
the curtain lifts. When it does lift you
see three cells in the Blackwell prison,
with numbers 13, 14, 15, peering through
the barred doors. They are swapping
jokes and turkey is their chief desire.
When they get tired of exchanging
Mr. Greene "s witticisms they take to
singing. you like them both ways.
Sydney Deane & "Co." present the
piece. Mr. .Deane and two of the
company have voices, one holding- a
basement C that belongs at the other
end of Tetrazzini's. They have good
songs, not a hint of the
"Do not take the doorknob from the
door,
"But leave it. mother, where it was
of yore"
kind. In fact No. 13, 14 15
are jovially unrepentant sinners,
and their "burgling and forg
ing" reminiscences make most of
the fun. The "company" distinct
ly deserves labeling, particularly one
Fred Jarvis, who is capital as the Eng
lish dude "trusty," "doing" his thirty
days for killing a silly person who got
in front of his automobile. The whole
sketch is flavorsome and funny to a
degree.
Lydia Yearnans Titug leads the new
people. Mrs. Titus is amusing as
ever, and fatter than general in her
baby impersonations. She does a grand
cpera imitation that is new, and of the
best. It Is distinctly and absurdly
reminiscent of Maria de Marchi, of late
and revered Conried memory. Jack
Norworth, another new light, did not
get his audience to begin with last
night. But his monologue is amusing,
if it just misses hitting the center of
things, and he has some new and funny
songs.
Herbert Brooks, with his truly mys
terious trunk act, better any day than
Herrmann's; the Busch-Devere trio,
â with their illustrated songs, and Louis
A. Simon, Grace Gardner and company
in "The New Coachman," the most
strenuous "rough-house" act that has
graced the Orpheum stage for some
time, are all still high favorites.

HI to 121 Post Street
by the Ferris Stock Company. Miss
Florence Stone, the popular actress
who has starred in many productions
here, was seen once again in the tile
roll of a new play When she made her
appearance on the stage in a big auto
mobile, it was the signal for a general
outburst of applause. Flowers were
showered upon the fair heroine and
her reappearance was marked by
everything that would betoken a suc
cessful season.
The Ferris company contains many
good actors, including Dick Ferris,
Miss Stone, Frederick Sumner. A, By
ron Beasley, Edith Julian, Irene Out
trim and many others. Their version
of Graustark was an exceptionally
good one and the difficult play was
well portrayed in every feature. Miss
Stone as the heroine gave a splendid
exhibition of emotional acting and was
well supported in these scenes by Mr.
Ferris.
The latter got several curtain calls
and favored the audience with a little
speech in which he said that his stock
company was about to enter on an ex
tended engagement here and he hoped
they would do justice to the pieces
they intended to play and satisfy the
public.
TORTURICI'S WIFE ATTENDS
MORNING MASS AT CHURCH
Accompanied by Her Child, Matron
Christ and a Policeman. She
Walks to St. Mary's.
Mrs. Rosa Torturlci, wife of the
murderer of Biaggio Vilardo, attended
the nine o'clock mass at St. Mary's
Church, California and Dupont streets,
yesterday morning. She had ex
pressed a desire on Friday to attend
the services on Easter Sunday in some
church where she would not meet any
of her race.
Accompanied by Matron Christ and
Policeman Michael Walsh and carry
ing her baby in her arms, she walked
from the prison to St. Mary's Church
shortly before nine o'clock. Matron
Christ sat beside her in church and
helped to quiet the baby when it be
came fretful. Matron Christ said that
Mrs. Torturici was a devout worship
er and at one time the tears rolled
down her cheeks as she hugged her
baby to her breast.
Mrs. Torturici had been provided
with a new Easter bonnet and a dress
by the president of the Italian Ladies'
Relief Society and she seemed to en
joy her outing.
POWERS FAMILY TROUBLES
TO BE AIRED IN COURT
The Powers family, who reside at
1332 Valencia street, intend to keep
the Mission police department busy
making arrests of the members of that
disunited family.
The troubles of this household were
brought to light yesterday morning,
when Mrs. Catherine Powers notified
Policeman Dasman that she wanted
her 16-year-old daughter. Eva, ar
rested for disturbing the peace. The
girl was taken into custody and when
brought to the Seventeenth-street sta
tion told her story to the effect that
she was employed in a candy store
on Kearny street and had been de
tained late on Saturday night attend
ing to Easter customers. When she
returned home her mother upbraided
her for being out late. The mother
called at the candy store to make in
quiries regarding the time her daugh
ter quit work. The proprietor got
angry at this interference and notified
the woman that hei* daughter was dis
charged. On the mother's return to
her home the row was renewed, and
the arrest followed.
Then came the father and husband.
William Powers, who got a warrant for
his wife's arrest on the charge of in
sanity. In the meantime another war
rant has been placed in the handa of
Captain M. O. Anderson for the ar
rest of "William Powers Jr. on the
complaint of his mother for disturb
ing: her peace.
