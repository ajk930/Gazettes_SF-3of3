Justice Smith Finds Rmdence Against Prisoner Is Sufficient
HOLDS WEBER FOR TRIAL
ON A CHARGE OF MURDER
JUSTICE SMITH decid
ed at Auburn yesterday
that Adolph Weber must
stand trial on the charge
â¢of having murdered his mother.
The prisoner's attorneys will try
to secure his release on bail
pending the trial. The officers
are still endeavoring to find
where the blood-stained revol
ver used by the murderer was
bought and will carry their
search to this city.
It was learned yesterday that
w'hile Weber was y^^g San
Francisco last July he had his
picture taken at a local studio
and that he gave an assumed
name to the attendant.

night for Edward H. Goodwin, scion of

discovered his identity and during the
night they kept him in a mental condi

Weber and Wills had been boyhood
friends and were almost Inseparable
until about four years ago. At that
time their paths diverged. Adolph' be
gan to drop all his friends. His life be
came more or less a solitary one. He
still kept up the outdoor athletics, and
occasionally mingled with his old school
friends at any general gathering..; . ;;
About a year ago he had practically
weaned himself away from all the as
sociates of his boyhood days. He went
so far that he finally stopped speaking
to the majority of his former friends.
He devoted his time to reading cheap
novels of the blood and thunder order.
Weber's sense of gratitude, . coupled
with some feeling 6f emotion, still
seemed to exist in him when he sent
word. to the correspondent of The Call
requesting that he visit him at the 4 jail.
1 WRITES NOTE OF THANKS.
"Adrian Wills' friendship' moves me
deeply. He Is the noblest specimen of
God's creation I have known. A year
ago, when I was | sick, he brought me
some quail. Last May I endeavored to
bring about the re-existence of that
happy tie which had embellished our
boyhood days. He responded not to my
effort, and until the fatal evening of
November 10, when I sarfk exhausted
beneath the little magnolia tree In front
of my burning home, no evidence of
recognition passed between us.

AUBURN, Nov. 23.â The only sign of
feeling that Adolph Weber has shown
since his arrest is manifested in the
following communication given by him
to a correspondent of The Call, with
the request that it be given publicity:

Returning to the cell door he bright

came up, and calling some of the other
boys raised me to my feet^and carried

was a towel. He came slowly forward
and without speaking a word handed

After the correspondent had read ths

owe to Adrian Wills to make this

Had Justice Smith failed to hold him,
Weber would have, been rearrested on
the . charge of killing his father, his
sister or his little brother. Except for
a slight flush which crept over his face,
young, Weber showed no visible sign of
emotion when he .heard the decision
committing him for trial. After court
adjourned he remained for some min
utes In > earnest conversation with his
attorney, Ben P. Tabor. He wrote a
couple of pages of manuscript for his
attorney, presumably notes taken dur
ing-the hearing."
The strain ' is beginning ; to tell on
Weber. Usually he walks into Â¦ the
courtroom wl(h elastic step | and with
head and shoulders erect. To-day he
held down his' head and his step was
slow. It is the belief of the officers
that it is only a question of time until
he breaks down and tells everything.
AUBURN, Nov., 23.â Adolph J. Web
er, 'the youth- accused of ..killing his
family,' will' face a Jury on the specific
charge of having murdered his mother.
Justice Smith, at the conclusion of the
preliminary hearing to-day, committed
the prisoner for trial and refused him
balL Â¦ ".'..-.'
The latest rumor concerning the pis
tol found in the barn is that the officers
have ascertained that a boy, James
Armstrong, sold a 32-callber pistol to
Eugene Rodehaver a few weeks ago.
At a dance Rodehaver hid the. pistol
outside, not wishing to take it Into the
hall. When he went to look for it later
it was gone. This story haa^not been
confirmed.
The officers now believe that the
shells (Peter's make) could have been
purchased in Auburn. One hardware
store here carries them, but R. J. Han
cock, the proprietor, does not recall
selling, any to Weber. Sheriff Keena
has inquired in Sacramento, and finds
but one hardware store that keeps the
Peters shells, Baker & Hamilton, and
the firm only sells at wholesale. The
pistol is not anew one. It shows rust
well eaten into the metal, and it may
be difficult to locate the. seller. The
number is 19554. It is an Iver Johnson
make, and the factory is located at
Fitchburg, Mass.
Weber sent word __ from the jail this
evening that he wanted to see John
Adams, his guardian, alone. His re
quest was not granted. Several days
ago Sheriff. Keena gave orders that no
one should be allowed to see the pris
oner without | an officer being j present,
.and this rule will be strictly enforced.

Mrs. Langhorne Putney, who returned
from St. Louis and is now with' the

According- to Mrs. Putney,- her hus

Young Putney's case is a mysterious

carrying her handbag, . containing
money and valuable Jewelry. Suddenly

WEBER'S MYSTERIOUS ACTION.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 23. â Dis
pleased by the actions of some na

sul at Alexandretta. is reported to
have lowered the American flag from
the consulate during a recent cele
bration in honor of the accession of
the Sultan. It is said the officials and
people 4 of Alexandretta regard the ac
tion of' the Consul as an insult, and it
is expected at the State Department
that a complaint on the subject will
reach here soon from Constantinople.
Should the Turkish Government
request the recall of Mr. Davis the
State Department would comply with
the request and he probably would be
given another assignment, unless it
should be known that his action was
unwarranted. *

the Sheriff. 2The pistol used by the
bank robber was oÂ£;22 caliber and was
found on the hillside below town. It
has been identified by Mr.'. Lichtenstein
of Sacramento and his description of
the purchaser tallies exactly with that
of Weber. "Cashier McFadyen says

that point.
LONDON, Nov. 24.â A dispatch from

A Japanese* correspondent, writing to
the Morning Post, betrays growing
anxiety concerning the Russian second

to the "strength of Port Arthur's re

consistency of Egypt in permitting
Vice Admiral Rojestvensky's ships to
coal when not going to a Russian port,
compared with Ahe refusal of such
facilities when the Spanish admiral,
Camara, wanted to take the battleship
Pelayo by the Suez route six years ago,
and maintains that it is Great Britain's
business to compel Egypt to maintain
neutrality in the present case.

ST. PETERSBURG. Nov. 24â (2:25

possibility of a big: battle south of
Mukden. The Japanese, according to
an official reDort. have received a se
vere setback in the vicinity of Sintsin
tin. in which direction they appar
ently were attempting to execute a
wide turning movement. The opinion
here is that it is scarcely possible that
the two great armies can winter less
than a rifle-shot distance from one an
other, though Ae heavy defenses on
each side make it extremely difficult
for either to assume the offensive.
It is believed, however, that if the
deadlock is to be broken. General Kuro
patkin will let Field Marshal Oyama
take the initiative, as the Russians
have the better of the present position,
namely, a strong line of defense and
Mukden behind them, making satisfac
tory winter quarters, where the Rus
sian reinforcements are now accumu
lating for an advance next spring.

SALONICA, European Turkey. Nov.
23. â Snow hinders the operations of the
troops sent against the Greek bandJ
entrenched southwest of Vedona, whose
outrages are terrorizing the -vicmlty.
The whole western part of the vilayet
of Salonica Is swarming with bands of
murderous Christians^ both Greek' and
Bulgarian, each of which is systemat
ically trying to weed out the most
prominent adherents of the other. .Mur
ders are frequent in Salonica itself and
are perpetrated with Impunity.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 23.â A report
received in Washington through official
sources says that a state- of anarchy
has become epidemic throughout Mace
donia, that public security has by. no
means been restored and that assas
sinations of Christians not in sym
pathy with the Bulgarian revolutionary
movement are of dally "occurrence. It
says that Greeks, as a rule, are tha
victims and large numbers of them
have been tortured, with the result that
the Greeks have started bands across
the frontier of Greece with retaliation
as their purpose. An extract from tha
report says:
"Public security Is by no means re
stored in Macedonia- So-called political
murders â that is, the assassination of
Christians not in sympathy with the
Bulgarian revolutionary movement, are
of daily occurrence. Refusal to- pay
blackmail or the indication of Â¦ tha
whereabouts of bands are reasons for
these murders, of which Greeks as a
rule are victims. Since the introduc
tion of reforms hundreds of Greeks of
the better class have been tortured to
death or burned alive by Bulgarian
bands."
. It also is stated that "these would-ba
savers of the country take good .care
not to molest the Turks." Another ex
tract from the report reads:
"In response the Greeks have now
started bands and have taken the law
into their own hands. Over 1000 men
In the last month have crossed the
Greek frontier with the object of pro
tecting their own countrymen. The
result is that a state of anarchy has
become prevalent throughout Mace
donia."
Because of the important part played
by torpedo craft in the war In the Far
East, It is deemed advisable that the
larger vessels of this type be command
ed by lieutenant commanders. To illus
trate how much older the captains of
the American navy are than those of
foreign navies, the report says the
youngest American commander on the
day he attained that rank was older
than the average age of Japanese and
about the same as the average of Eng
lish/and German captains. He had
passed the compulsory retirement age
for Japanese captains and was within
sixteen months of the compulsory re
tirement age for German and English
officers.
No specific remedy for this is offered
because Admiral Converse feels that if
the need be recognized by higher au
thority satisfactory means may soon
bV devised. He remarks, however,
"that until "a measure Is adopted for
the* compulsory ' retirement' of com
manders and captains that do not gain
promotions at certain ages the ages of
officers in the different grades will not
be satisfactory."
Authorization by Congress of two
vice admirals is urgently recommended
in order that our flag officers may not
YOUNG OFFICERS NEEDED.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 23.â How badly
off the navy is for officers and how se
riously this condition may affect the
navy and the nation is told in the-an
nual report of Rear Admiral George A.
Converse, Chief of the Bureau of Navi
gation, approved by. Secretary Morton
to-day. Experience, especially in gun
fire, he says, has shown that it is nec
essary to. increase the number of.offi
cers assigned to a ship, so that the
estimate made in 1902 of the number of
officers .for ships in commission
is ' inadequate. : - It provides for only
ab'out one-half as "many. 1 officers as
ships of- the same class carry in' the
British, French and German navies.
Admiral Converse recommends that the
number of lientenants be increased
from 350 to '600 and that the number of
lieutenant commanders' be j increased
from 200 to 300. "It is especially desira
ble." the admiral says, "that every bat
tleship and other powerful vessel re
quiring the ' greatest skill and experi
ence Â¦ for : proper efficiency should have
her fuir quota'of officers of suitable
rank;. yet many of our battleships have
lieutenants as navigators, practi
cally all have lieutenants as ord
nance officers and several battleships
have: ensigns and even midshipmen as
watqh and division officers. This very
unsatisfactory, and even dangerous,
condition is due to the many urgent de
mands for officers, the existing inade
quacy of numbers often making it im
possible to detail officers of appropriate
rank. The increasing numbers of mid
shipmen graduated from the Naval
Academy in time wjll partially relieve
the situation in the lower grades, but
more lieutenant commanders and lieu
tenants are needed than existing laws
provide."
"Although a hundred and more tor
pedo-boats and destroyers have been
actually engaged for five months
against battleships, which have been
exposed to attack times without num
ber, we have yet to learn authoritative
ly of a torpedo from a torpedo-vessel
causing the loss of a single battleship.
Those which have been sunk owed their
destruction to submarine mines anchor
ed or broken adrift, torpedo-vessels not
contributing to the result except by
the confusion and sense of Sweater dan
ger djie to their presence. It Is evident
that In the final summary of losses the
achievements of torpedo-vessels will
count less than was at first supposed.
It cannot be claimed, therefore, that
there has been so far anything to dis
credit the battleship as a type, nor is
any such outcome to be expected from
this war, whatever may be the casual
ties among battleships. To wage suc
cessful warfare with a naval force re
quires now n and,,it baa. refluired in all
ages, a type* of vessel" which' shall com
bine in the most . effective manner the
qualities of offense, mobility, defense,
endurance and self maintenance. Such
vessels are battleships . and they con
stitute, the main strength and" reliance
of a navy."
Early in the report Admiral Converse
calls attention to the need of a general
staff or, board, "an advisory body which
shall not be under the control of any
bureau, but responsible directly to the
Secretary."
Regarding the paramount efficiency
of the battleships and the part played
by them in the Far Eastern war, Ad
miral Converse says:
WORTH OF BATTLESinPS.
be beneath foreign officers holding In
ferior commands.
"It is manifestly undesirable," says
the admiral, "for our flag officers to be
beneath all others in matter of pre*-'
cedence in international affairs with
which they have to do as representa
tives of the United States."
â¢ It is therefore recommended that the
rank of vice admiral be conferred upon
the officers detailed as commanders in
chief of the North Atlantic and Asiatic
fleets and that the law reviving this
grade provide that "no officer shall hold
the rank of vice admiral in either the
active or retired list, except wljile ex
ercising: -such, command, until he shall
have commanded a 4Jeet as vice ad
miral foe. two., years or else as a flag
officer for three . years altogether, at
teast one of those years as a vice ad
miral," and ,that officers may not, as
they retire, be; promoted to the grade
of vice admiral. <
Attention is called to the indispens
ability of cÂ»uisers, the report saying:
"We require a cruiser squadron in the
North Atlantic, South Atlantic and the
Caribbean and also 1 on the European
station, all these being ready on the
approach of hostilities to combine in
one fleet wherever needed. In the Pa
cific our force should consist of a large
squadron of cruisers and on the
Asiatic station . the battleships should
be supplemented with a full squadron
of cruisers."

QUIETLY GATHERS EVIDENCE
RELATING TO BEEF TRUST
At the moment of the collision
many steerage passengers were on
the side of the ship toward the ap
proaching float. When the crash
came and the Xord Amerika keeled
over alarmingly many of the passen
gers were greatly frightened, and the
cre*r had much difficulty in reassur
ing them.
When the collision occurred the
Xord Amerika was going down the
upper bay with a full head of steam.
She had left her pier at the foot of
West Thirty-fourth street at 1:15
q'clock. As she was passing the
statue of Liberty Captain Raffo saw
on his starboard bow the heavy steel
float with a dozen freight' cars aboard
coming directly toward him. Ac
cording to the captain's statement he
thought the captain of the float in
tended to pass at his stern and kept
on p his course, but the float came on
at full speed and struck the steam
ship.
After the Xord Amerika regained
an even keel and the passengers were
quieted the vessel returned to her
pier. The float, which had appar
ently suffered but little in the colli
sion, . continued its course.

the black spots.
"Without a chemical test I would not
venture to say whether or not the
specks were made by gunpowder," said
' Dr. Lederle. '"I only examined them
I with a microscope."
Levy suggested that Dr. O'Hanlon be
put on the stand to tell the jury what
made the black marks on the skin.
Rand objected to the defense going on
at this stage of the trial and also to
calling O'Hanlon as an expert.
"I have a man who extracted grains
of powder from those pieces of skin,"
said Levy.
Justice Davis admonished the attor
ney to be more careful in his remarks,
and directed the Jury to disregard the
utterances of counsel regarding what It

by others than the witness disclosed.
Edward F. Freligh, a clerk in Stern's
pawnshop, said that late on the after
noon of June 3 last a man and a wom
an bought a revolver at the place where
he was employed. The man was tall
and well built, but he was unable to
describe the woman. The sale was
made by Stern, the proprietor. He iden
tified the weapon exhibited in court as
the one purchased by the man.
YOUNG ABUSED THE WOMAX.
John Crowley, a cabman, said he was
! hailed by two men and a woman about
, 4 o'clock on the morning of June 4,
while his cab was standing at the cor
ner of Eighth avenue and One Hundred
and Tw*>nty-fifth street. The woman
was the defendant in this case and one
i of the men was Caesar Young. Young
j had abused Miss Patterson, the witness
i said, and she was crying. Young c-r
j dered him to drive the woman to her
home and he did so. Cn the way down
town he watched the occupants of the
cab through the trap in the top of the
hansom and she continued crying all
the way dawn to Sixty-first street,
where she left the cab. Crowley said
that Young and the man were intoxi
cated, but that Miss Patterson was not.
Albert Sehueider, another cabman,
witnessed the scene when Miss Patter
son was put Into Crowley's cab and he
corroborated the testimony of the pre
vlou witness. After Crcwley drove
away, he said, Young and his compan
ion called him and were driven to a
house on West One Hundred and For
tieth street. He noticed that both men
were under the influence oi liquor.
" 3IORGAX SMITH'S BRUTALITY. .
The scene between "Xan" Patterson
and her brother-in-law, J. Morgan
' Smith, which was referred to at lengthy
! by Rand in his opening argument, was
j described by Joseph Hewitt, a news
boy. He said he was standing -ta front
of a cafe at Fifty-nintn street and
Eighth avenue about 9 o'clock on the
, night of June Z when Smith and Miss
Patterson came out and got into a cab.
They were quarreling and as they got
Into the cab Smith struck Miss Patter
son on the face.
"What did the man say?" asked Levy.
Â¦ "He said, 'You'll have to do It,' " an
swered the newsboy.
"And what did she say?"
" 'I won't,' and then he struck her
and pushed her into the cab."
Hewitt said he remembered the Inci
dent distinctly and was positive in his
identification of Miss Patterson and the
photograph of J. Morgan Smith. He
had noticed the couple particularly, he
said.
"There ia always a little quarreling
going around the circle, and I keep my
eyes open to see the fun," the newsboy
explained.
Police Captain Sweeney was recalled
to identify a photograph of Smith and
to testify that he had summoned Smith
to appear before the Grand Jury and
that Smith had failed to appear. He
said he procured a process against
Smith on June 9, but that he still had
it, having beA unable to serve it. A
warrant calling for Smith's arrest for

testimony of physicians was offered

have killed himself. Two cabmen tes
tified to havingr seen Young abuse

to her: "You will have to do it." and j

The cross-examination of Coroner's
Physician O'Hanlon was continued, j
The witness described In detail the
autopsy which he performed on
Young's body and admitted that at
that time he thought the case wa3 one I
of suicide. This was stricken from '
the record, however. He was not per
mitted to say whether the black
marks on the bits of skin which he
â¢tripped from Young's finger were
made by punpowder or whether he {
found powder mnrks when he exam- I

ter the shooting. '
The trial still attracts unusually j

room and to maintain order in the
building.
CLAIMS OF TI^E DEFENSE.
V.*hen the trial of "Xan" Patterson
was resumed to-day her attorney.
Abraham Levy, declared that, al
though the prosecution, has erected
several strong barriers through which
the defense would have to batter ( ts
way to obtain the acquittal of Miss
Patterson, he had no fear that they
would not succeed. He asserted that
he would bring forward a witness who
would tell a convincing story of hav
ing actually seen the shooting, no
matter how strong the evidence of the
r^orle to the effect that no one was
within the range of vision of the cab
when the fatal shot was fired.
This witness was a passenger on a
street car passing across West Broad
Â¦nay, he said, and In his narrative he
would swear that from where he stood,
though his glance was but momentary!
he saw -Xan" Patterson's companion
in the cab grapninp a revolver in his j
hand and struggling with the young
woman, who was endeavoring to wrest
Jt from him.
The skeleton which was brought into
the case yesterday for the use of Cor
cners Physician O'Hanlon in describ- j
in* the course of the bullet which'
caused Young's death was again j
brought into the courtroom when the
trial was resumed to-day. The ghastly
exhibit was suspended near the witness
stand when Levy, for the defense, con- i
tinued the cross-examination of the â¢
Coroner's physician, which was inter
rupted by the adjournment of court
yesterday.
BELIEVED IT WAS SUICIDE.
Levy in his cross-examination led Dr.
O'Kanlon back over the ground covered |
in his direct testimony yesterday. The j
witness described in detail the autopsy
which he performed on Young's body.
'If you had regarded the case as one
cf homicide, would you have made a
more careful examination?" asked
Levy.
"I did not regard it then as a case of
fcomicide."
'Did you regard it as a case of sui
cide?"
"I did," the witness replied.
Dr. O'Hanlon said that while per
forming 'the autopsy he found three
black marks on the second finger of
Young's right hand, and he stripped â¢
off pieces of skin, which were turned j
over to the District Attorney. The wit- j
Bess was not permitted to answer a j
Cuestion as to whether the black marks !
were made by gunpowder. '
Another Question, as to whether he )
found any indication of gunpowder â¢
when he examined "Xan" Patterson's j
hands soon after the shooting, also met j
with an objection from the prosecu
tion, and the court directed the witness
not to answer.
At the conclusion of Dr. O'Hanlon's
examination that part of his testimony
Jn which he said that he considered the
ease to be one of suicide and not homi
cide when%he performed the autopsy
was stricken from the .record on mo
tion of Rand. Counsel* for the defense
took an exception. to the ruling of Jus
tice Davis on this point.

A report was received by Manager
Agler of the Southern Pacific Com
pany yesterday that an attempt had'
been made to wreck southbound pas
senger train No. 10 a few miles this
side of Santa Barbara." Fortunately
the wreckers were discovered "In "their
dastardly work and an accident nar
rowly averted. Shortly after a north
bound train left Santa Barbara at an
early hour yesterday morning tWo
tramps were ejected from one of the
forward cars. An hour later the men
gathered together a number of empty
powder cans, which they filled with
recks, and then pilled them on the
track with several big boulders.
While engaged in their work they
were seen by a man on his way to
Capitan. The latter reported the mat
ter to the railroad officials, who sent
out section hands to signal the south
bound passenger train and clear the
track. On their way to the scene of
the attempted wreck the railroad men
captured two tramps, who answered
the description of the men who had
been piling obstructions on the
rails. The men were taken later to
Santa Barbara, where they were
turned over to the Sheriff and to
whom they later made a full confes
sion. They said they put the obstruc
tion on the track to get even with the
company for putting them off the
train. Had the passenger train struck
the obstruction it is probable that a
serious wreck would have resulted.

For five days the crew of the barken
tine was huddled on the top of the
cabin, with no protection whatever
from the gale. Exoepting a few raw po
tatoes the men had nothing to eat and
only such water as could be secured by

sibly have survived two days longer.
The Webfoot sailed from Coos Bay
for San Francisco on October 14, carry
ing a cargo of 350,000 feet of lumber.
Soon after leaving port she encounter
ed the first of the -heavy gales which
recently prevailed. On the 18th she be
came water-logged.
The cabins were flooded and every
thing lcose was carried away, includ
ing the clothing of the men and the
provisions. During the night of the
21st all three of her masts were rolled
out, but It was daylight before I the
crew succeeded in cutting them clear
of the vessel. Tuesday afternoon, after
the six vessels had passed the barken
tine. and failed to offer assistance, the
mate, named Bromer, and two seamen,
one named. O'Neill, left the vessel in a
small boat to- seek assistance. At this
time the gale was raging with great
fury, and there is no doubt that the
three men were drowned.
This morning the steamer Elder, on
her way to San Francisco, sighted the
dismasted barkentine off Tlllamook
Rock. The Elder gave the' men some
provisions and hastened back to the
Columbia River, where she summoned
assistance. Tugs and Government ves
sels put to sea, and the Wallula soon
had the wreck in tow. When the Web
foot arrived here her men were almost
dead.
The vessel is a total loss except for
her lumber cargo, of which 100,000 feet
was lost. She was built in 1869 at Coos
Bay and is owned by the Simpson
Lumber Company.

CHICAGO, Nov. 23.â A labor union
conspiracy is the latest explanation of
the automobile tragedy near Lemont,
111. According to this theory John W.
Bate Jr., the young chauffeur, was the
victim of bullets intended for Edwin
Archer, a vital witness for the prosecu
tion in a criminal case involving a
number of Chicago labor union officials.
Archer was an employe of the same au
tomobile company for which Bate
worked. "
It is a singular fact that Archer and
Bate were the only two chauffeurs on
duty when the automobile was hired
by telephone for "Mr. Dove," the sup
posed murderer. Only a moment before
Archer was alone, and it was he who
received the original commission to ac
company "Dove." A sudden impulse
or presentiment of danger led Archer
to turn the work over to Bate.
Archer has for months believed him
self in danger, since he gave evidence
in the case of an alleged professional
slugger who was charged with having
attacked non-union electrical workers
and who was freed by a change of
court records. The alteration of the
records was discovered and led to the
conviction of a court clerk and several
officials of labor unions on a charge of
conspiracy. Other cases were still pend
ing.
Archer's attorney was to-day so
strongly Impressed with the probabil
ity of the labor union conspiracy ex
planation of the tragedy that he laid
all the facts before the State's Attor
ney. A partial confirmation of the the
ory is the fact that "Dove" is said to
have avowed himself to be an elec
trician while casually explaining his
identity during an attempt to hire a
horse and buggy in Joliet the day after
the tragedy. *
William Friend, alias Patten, who is
held as the principal in the killing of
Weakly, in an Interview denies all
knowledge of a plot In which he drew
the short straw to do the shooting and
others were assigned to their respective
parts. â¢ /> i Â¦
In the remaining pan of his confes
sion Rauhauser tells o*f having put the
cartridges in. lathes at 3:30 o'clock on
November 21 and of the first discharge
at 5 o'clock, while the workmen were
pouring metal In the mold*
"I was Instructed in the use of dy
namite by Joseph Hollowell, at the
same time he told me to destroy the
mold of the shear punch, Valentine
agreeing to pay me $20 if I succeeded
in destroying the shear punch. I was
told by Joseph Hollowell to destroy all
the molds I could and was' given five
cartridges by Hollowell.
"I left Valentine's office at 10 o'clock
and returned to my home, telling my
mother what I was expected to do. I
went to work as usual on Monday, No
vember 21." .
RECEIVES INSTRUCTIONS.
The cases of Fred Rauhauser Jr.,
Fred Rauhauser Sr., John Hook, Joseph
Hollowell and Joseph F. Valentine were
called lit the Police Court to-day and
en motion of their attorneys their trial
was set for December 14. the cases of
Edward Trainer and Thomas Bracken
were set for next Saturday.
It Â»vas learned -to-night that the
officials of the Iron Holders' Union will
ask the courts here for a restraining
order against the Employers' Associa
tion and certain members of the asso
ciation to prohibit them from continu
ing the investigation in the conspiracy
crse, on th? ground that the examina
tion of the case has reached a point
where it is persecution rather than in
vestigation.
CONFESSION OF APPRENTICE.
It Is said that Fred Rauhauser,
the apprentice, aged 19 years, to
day repeated * his confession with
out contradictions, and that it
Is confirmed by his father, who is
also under arrest. Young Rauhauser
insists that John Hook, committeeman
of the local union, sought him and his
fathej on the night of November 16.
Later that night Hook brought in Jo
seph Hollowell, who went out for the
dynamite after Hook had made ar
rangements with the apprentice. Hol
lowell was to get the dynamite at
Helnekamp's office. Finding that place
closed, Rauhauser said:
"I then was asked to return to Heine
kamp's office on Sunday morning, No
vember 20. I went alone to Heine
kamp's office at the appointed time and
met Joseph Hollowell, went from there
to Valentine's office, where we met
Valentine.
CLEVELAND. Nov. 23.â Joseph F.
Vaientlne, president of the Iron Mold
ers' Union of North America, was pjaced
under arrest here to-day by the Cleve
land police upon a telegraphic request
from the Cincinnati police authorities.
Valentine made no resistance to being
taken into custody, and instead of try-
Ing- to avoid such action waited at his
hotel eeveral hours for the expected of
ficers.
Valentine's arrest is made in connec
tion with alleged violence by members
of the organization of which he is the
head in Cincinnati, where a strike is on.
He was not locked ur>, but was de
tained in the Central police station. He
was permitted to address a local union
of the Cleveland molders to-night. In
accordance with an engagement he had
made several weeks ago.
CINCINNATI. Nov. 23.â No addi
tional arrests were made here to-day
In connection with the alleged plot of
the striking molders to destroy the
Eureka foundry with dynamite. The
day passed quietly at the foundries.
Chief Interest centered in the arrest of
Joseph Valentine, president of the Iroh-
Molders of North America, in Cleve
land. The charge against Valentine is
aiding and abetting in the malicious
destruction of property. The warrant
for his arrest was sworn to by Presi
dent Henry Gossiger of the Eureka
Foundry Company, a personal friend of
the accused- A detective from this
city started for Cleveland late this
afternoon to bring Valentine back to
this city. Another detective went to
Detroit for Thomas Bracken, who is
charged with complicity in the murder
of Samuel Weakley, a non-union mol
der, here October 7.

at tho time a bona fide resident of the
Ftate of .Nebraska; that she fraudu
lently i''.nc( alod herself from her hus
band, and that the testimony on which
the obtFired her decree was perjured.
Last month the little fellow seized a
big butcherknife from the kitchen ta
ble and jammed it down his throat. He
was so nearly dead that it was feared
he would not recover. No sooner had
he regained 'sufficient strength than he
grabbed a hammer and began pounding
on his temples. His face was badly
bruised.
' The boy's father, who was a miner,
was killed some time ago In a mine dis
aster in Colorado. '
When pleaded with by his mother the
lad' declared his father was constantly
calling him. Quite distracted, his
mother said to him: . â¢
"Dewey, I will put you in a hole In
the ground if you do not stop this."
"That's where I want to go, mamma,"
cried the youngster. ."That's where
papa Is, and I want to go to him."
OMAHA, Nov. 23.â Twice within the
past week six-year-old Dewey Newhill
of Tilden, Nebraska, # has made a des
perate attempt to commit suicide. He
declares his dead father is calling to
him. and he wants to go to where his
father, is.
Two weeks ago Daniel PJeefer, a
baker, who lived at 4057 Twenty-fifth,
street, was reported missing from his
home and his faithful wife, had spent
the weary fortnight trying to find trace
of him. The woman's search was re
warded yesterday afternoon when ahe
stumbled across his remains strung to
the limb of a tree in Sutro Park forest,
near the Corbett road.
Every day since Pfeefer had been
missing his wife hunted over the hills
and among the sand dunes for her hus
band's body. She was convinced that
he had taken his own life and her sur
mise proved startlingly correct.
Until about- six months ago Pfeefer
conducted a small bakery on Church.
street, near Seventeenth. When he
sold out he made no effort to acquire
another business or secure employ
ment. About a month ago it was no
ticed that he acted strangely. He was
pensive and he seldom spoke to any
one. On the morning of November 14
he left his home saying that he would*
return in the evening, but when he did
not do so his wife started a search for
him. First she visited all of her hus
band's haunts, and when she found!
he had not been seen in any of these
she started about the city Inquiring
if any. one had seen "a man with a coat
buttoned over an undershirt rambling;
about." Yesterday, in company with
her brother-in-law,/ Conrad Dettling.
she visited the Sutro forest. After sev
eral hours' tramp she came upon the
body, then she went to rft. Boniface's
Church for advice and the priests told
her to notify the officials-
A strange feature of the case i3 that
while Pfeefer has been missing nearly
two weeks yet he hanged himself with
in twenty-four hours of the time he
was found. This was determined by
the condition of the body. Just where
Pfeefer spent the intervening time 13
hard to tell, but the Morgue officials
will endeavor to ascertain. His family
say he was. without doubt, insane, and
the deed is attributed to insanity.
."You have riot examined, it," sug
gested the lawyer. "Perhaps if you
were to examine it you might refresh
your memory." :
Still Hermann could not place it, but
he remembered what it was about-
Senator Mitchell had called upon him
at his office in company with S. A. D.
Puter and had said that Puter had
some land cases which he was inter
ested in and would like to have ex-'
pedited' by the department.
Judge O'Day, for 'the defense," ob
jected to' this admission, because Sen
ator Mitchell was not present and
could not be questioned, but the ob
jection was not heeded by the court.
"Did any one accompany Mr. Puter?"
"There was a woman with him," re
plied the witness, "that is as* far as I
can remember, also a clerk named
Valk. The clerk said that the papers
were all right, that he had examined
them, and I sent them to Governor
Richards, my assistant, who afterward
issued the final papers."
Hermann had only seen the woman
once, he said, and when asked if he
could identify her responded* in the
negative.
Hermann gave other evidence as to
the manner of conducting the business
of the land office and was then excused
without cross-examination.
John Withycombe, chief draughts
man in the Surveyor General's office,
and A. W. Barber, a clerk in the Gen
eral Land Office, were called to identify
certain maps, after which court ad
journed until to-morrow.
Attorney Henri .of the prosecution
handed him a' second, which met the
fate of the first.- 'â¢ 'Â» .
"I do not know that I. have ever seen
this," said Hermann, looking at it
Judiciously through his glasses. "I
know that the signature is that of Sen
ator Mitchell." '
Congressman Binger Hermann was
the next witness. Hermann was Com
mlsskfeer of the General. Land Office
at Washington from March, 1897, until
February 1, 1903. He told of the man
ner of conducting the correspondence
at this department and how the mail
was handled. A letter was offered to
him signed John H. Mitchell.
Circuit Judge William Galloway of
the Third District was the first witness
called by the Government to-day. The
Judge testified that he was Receiver of
the United States land office at^Oregon
City from February, 1896, tofJuly, 1902,
during the period when Mrs. jJjÂ«ter, ' or
Mrs. Watson, as the Government will
try to show her to be, took proof of
homesteads before that office. He iden
tified certain papers to be used as. evi
dence in the case.
H. F. Coleman, a clerk in the General
Land Office at Washington, testified to
receiving the applications at that office,
and Special Inspector A. R.'Greene tes
tified to having had the papers in his
custody and to the time when he re
ceived them from Washington. - -
PORTLAND, Nov. 23.â The Federal
attorneys in the land fraud cases bent
every energy in court to-day to show
primarily as a basis. for its ground for
prosecution that the Government has
been robbed by somebody with the end
in view of later on fastening the crimes
the accused persons now on trial.
All morning witnesses occupied the
box to establish the identity of docu
ments by which the Government hopes
to establish to the satisfaction of the
jury that Miss Ware, Mrs. Watson, Itc-
Kinley, Puter and others are guilty -of
acts of conspiracy to defraud the Gov
ernment. ,
Thus far the Government has sought
to prove that somebody has committed
a crime by the introduction of evidence
to indicate overt acts, reserving until
later (Jevelopments which are expected
to show the conspiracy of the princi
pals by connecting them with the" il
legal acts. This manner of proving the
case was objected to by the defense
this afternoon, but Judge Bellinger sus
tained the position taken by the prose
cution.
CHICAGO. Nov. 23.â Samuel P. Glos
ser, a patient in the county asylum for
the insane at: Dunning, was choked to
death last night, and to-morrow the
Coroner will endeavor to ascertain
whether he was . killed by Alexander
Harper, a colored man, who is also a
patient in the asylum, or whether' it
was done by' John Conway and, Scott
Hogan, two of the asylum attendants.
Hogan and Conway assert that Glos
ser was violent . and that Harper as
sisted them, in placing him under re
straint, and Harper declares that both
the attendants kicked Glosser and that
Hogan choked him. â¢
The trouble started with a fight be
tween Glosser and Harper, in which
the former. w*as the aggressor. He was
finally strapped to his bed by the at
tendants â¢ and Harper, but working
loose from the straps that held him he
again attacked Harper. The two at
tendants came to the assistance of Har
p"er and a desperate struggle ensued.
Glosser soon became unconscious, and
one of the physicians was called and
pronounced him dead. His windpipe
had been broken in the severe choking
he had received and his body was ter
ribly bruised, there being many marks
of boot heels in the flesh.iDr. Springer,
the county physician, who held an au
topsy to-night, declared that it was ut
terly impossible for Harper to have in
flicted all the wounds on the body of
Glosser. and he recommended that the
two attendants be held until after the
Coroner's inquest.

THE VALUE OF CHARCOALj.
Few People Know How Useful It Is in
Prcsenins Health and Beauty. i
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
few realize its value when taken, into
the human system for the same cleans-
ing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
5-ou take of it the better; it is not a
dru?7 at all, but simply absorbs the
rases and impurities always present in
the etomach and intestines and carries
them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
rmokint,. drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
jiro\-es the complexion, it whitens the
U-t th and further acts as a natural and
eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects ihe mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal In one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most. for the money
k in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; ahey
ere composed of the finest powdered
v illow charcoal and other harmless
antiseptics in tablet form or rather In
the form of large, pleasant tasting
lozenges, the charcoal being mixed
with hor.ey. . ; -,'.
The daily use of these lozenges will
Foon tell in a much improved condi-
tion of the general health., better com-
Elexion, sweeter < breath.', and purer
Jood. and the beautv of it is that no
possible harm can result from thetr
Â« ontlnued use. but "oh the contrary
great benefit.
A Buffalo physi'---. in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I ad-
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
)Â«at tents suffering from gas in stomach
nnd bowels, and to clear the com-
1 l^xion and. purify the breath, mouth
*ti4 throat: I also believe the liver is
preatly benefited by the dally use of
them: they cost but twenty-five cents
a box at drug stores, and. although
ir. some sense Â« natent preparation, yet
I believe I get -more and better char-
coal in Stiart's Charcoal Lozenges
than in an- of the ordinary. charcoal
tablets." - EflsSEIEHJ

The case had been heard and was

Bernard 3IcNlnnie's Body Pound.
The' body of Bernard McNinnie, a

Ing in the bay yesterday afternoon off
Meiggs wharf. It had 'been in the wa

was without family and his friends
say that he had often threatened sui

It is a scriptural sayingr that a house
divided against itself must fall, but it
does not logically follow that a town
divided against itself must go to

countries running along the middle of
the principal street.
The part of the town in the United
States. is in San Diego County. It has
been christened "Calexieo." The other
half Is in Mexico and has been called
"Mexicale." both names being formed
from the words ."California" and
"Mexico." In Calexieo there is a
United States custom-house, under
jurisdiction of the Collector of Cus

MURDERER'S AVIFE ASKS
COURT FOR SEPARATION
The Judge held that the primary elec
tion law was constitutional and disal
lowed the demurrer. Wyman pleaded
not guilty and the case was continued
till December 12 to be set for trial. '
The argument, on the demurrer to
quash the indictment charging Joseph
Rebstock, election officer, with ' violat
ing the primary election law was also
concluded, but the Judge reserved his
decision.;.
The argument on the demurrer to the
information charging Charles Wyman
with fraudulently voting at the last
primary election was resumed before
Judge Lawlor yesterday afternoon. At
torney Countryman contended that in
the act of 1901 the Legislature did. not
intend that any penalty should attach
to violations of the primary election
law and where there was no penalty
there could be no crime. He also argued
that section 64& of the Penal Code
regarding primary elections was un
constitutional because the act of 1899,
in which It was Incorporated, had been
declared unconstitutional.
Countryman took the further. ground
that section 2% of the State constitu
tion regarding primary elections was
in conflict with the Federal constitu
tion. He cited as an Illustration the*
fact that In view of the preponderance
of Republicans in the Legislature and
their percentage being high the Dem
ocratic party could not hold another
convention. That party could not go
on the ballot again by petition because
the "Registrar had the right to strike
out all the names of those who voted
at the last primary election, and they
would not have the necessary percent
age except Republican voters came "to
their fescue. He also argued that the
information had been drawn up under
the wrong section of 'the Penal Code.
Attorney Hosmer in reply contended
that the State constitution does not
conflict with the Federal constitution,
Inasmuch as it' was left to the State to
establish its own system of voting and
Qualification of voters. He argued at
considerable length that the informa
tion was drawn up under the proper
section of the Penal Code. The de
fendant had been guilty of fraudu
lently voting the name of S. IL'Mann,
although the other side had contended
that the defendant could only be
charged with false personation. '
Alleged delay on the part of the gas
Company in answering complaints of
low pressure gas and fluctuating supply
impelled a Coroner's jury yesterday to
censure" the company for the death of
Martin Ehrlich and to recommend reg
ulating legislation on the part of the
Supervisors.
Ehrlich was., accidentally suffocated
In his bed at 3342 Sixteenth street on
November 3. The evidence was that
the fixtures were leaking, and that
when on one occasion, according to the
statement of Mrs. Ethel Thlessen, a
plumber came to repair c. leak he
pumped^ water into the pipes in order
that the iron might become rusted and
stop the escape.
It was also In evidence that Mrs.
Jennings' complaint to- the gas com
pany about low pressure was not at- :
tended to until srbout a week after she
had notified the company. The follow
ing was the verdict:
During the course of Investigation, it hav
ing appeared that the - fixtures In the house
were bo flimsy as to Invite leakage, we recom
mend that the Board of Supervisors require
that fixtures of : certain standards be placed in
all buildings; also that an ordinance be passed
requiring: that all gas pipes and fixtures In new
buildings ' be thoroughly Inspected. We - also
censure the San .Francisco Gas and Electric
Company for their dilatory methods Jn ' re
sponding to the complaints - of - leakage and
other trouble with the g&s In buildings.

eion to think otherwise. In the cross
examination she said she never knew
that her friend was afflicted with in
somnia, pains in the back of the head
or any physical ills, as is alleged by
the contestant. Miss Dolbeer had com
plained of headaches, but the use of
glasses cured the ailment.
Miss Mary Jolllffe gave testimony to
the same effect as that of Miss Spreck
els. The witness received a letter from
Miss Dolbeer that was written in mid
ocean and mailed at Queenstown, and
the testatrix happily described inci
dents of her trip. Miss Warren was
referred to as "auntie" in a statement
that she was proving a good sailor.
Miss Mary Josselyn explained that
she and Miss Dolbeer both .stayed at
the Reglna Hotel In Paris and saw
each other every day. They went out
together often. Among other things
they participated In the v "battle of
roses" In June, and the testatrix took
a lively part in the fete of gayety. They
were both being treated by Dr. Gros
for anemia. Miss Dolbeer had, also con
tracted a cold in crossing the Atlantic,
but she was not in serious ill health
nor were her spirits at all depressed.
Miss Josselyn described her as "very
cheerful" while in Paris during the
weeks immediately preceding her death
in New York on July 9.
"Miss Dolbeer was perfectly rational
at all times, and certainly of sound
mind." said Miss Josselyn.
Cross-examination of the witness will
be resumed on Monday.

Judge Fritz yesterday for the .arrest
of Arthur Coleman, an ex-convict, on
a charge of forgery. Detective Ed

Coleman has been in the habit of

vais sent a telegram to Joseph Gervals
of Fargo, X. D., asking him to send
$60 at once. The money was forward

company's office, representing himself
as Ovlde Gervals and asked for the
money. He was informed that he
would be required to be identified.
Coleman taken by H. W.

George," to H. Le Baron Smith, tailor,
"$20 Bush street, and was introduced
to Smith as Gervals. Smith was asked
to identify Coleman and the trio went
to the company's office. After Cole

Gerrais to the order and Smith and
Knowlton had indorsed it the money
was paid to Coleman. The forgery
was discovered a few days ago and
Smith paid over the $60 to the tele
graph company.

CALL BUREAU, WORLD'S FAUI,
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 23.â The golden glow
of Sacramento Valley oranges filled the
mammoth Palace of Agriculture at the
World's Fair this afternoon, and surg
ing thousands cast delighted glances
upon the flowers and fruits of Califor
nia, and when formed into an orderly
line ate of the luscious fruit as it was
passed out to them. California, and
.especially the Sacramento Valley^ has
received a great advertisement. The real
productiveness of the northern- part of
th State is known to-night to' the peo
ple of more parts of the world than it
ever was before. >
Though the distribution of oranges
did not begin until 3 o'clock, there was a
Jam in the aisle facing the Sacramento
Valley exhibit before noou, and it grew
greater as the hours wore on. It seemed
as if half the people who had visited
the fair, were there to witness the un
usual scene and get an orange fresh
from the California groves. The crowd
did not show the wolfish propensities
usually manifest on such occasions, but
was reasonably well behaved. At 3
o'clock some speeches were made. Com
missioner J. A. Filcher spoke of the
beauties of California and the Sacra
mento Valley. Ed E. Leake of Wood
land told the people that fruits and
flowers of every description grow from
end to* end of California, and that not
only oranges, but strawberries, were
being picked in the Sacramento Valley.
Roy Brooke also made some remarks,
and the distribution began.
The exhibit space was roped off on
the main corridor and the Jefferson
Guards forced the forming of a line. It
extended from the center of the build
ing clear outside the south end, and
was made up of thousands. When the
fruit distribution ended chrysanthe
mums were handed out to the people,
who again formed into a surging mob
and scrambled wildly for bunches of
flowers thrown to them.

Consul General Zayquas said that
his Government was considerably dis
turbed over the widespread reports in
this country that yellow fever had
broken out on the island. Such re
ports, he said, had a tendency to keep
away tourists and hamper the trade
between this country and Cuba.
It is learned that the reason for
the energetic action of the State De
partment was that the marine hospi
tal service had reported that yellow
fever had appeared in several places
In the island of Cuba and it was
feared there might be an outbreak
in some of the large cities If prompt
preventive measures were not taken.
XEW YORK. Nov. 23. â The offi
cials of the Cuban Government to-day
officially deny the reports published in
this country that there is yellow fever
in Cuba. The denial was given out
through the Cuban Consul General la
this city.
WASHINGTON*. Nov. 23.â It was
said to-night that the communication
of the State Department to the Cuban
Government regarding the frightful
sanitary conditions at Santiago and
elsewhere is most emphatic in char
acter and is Intended to impress the
Cuban Government with the desire
of this Government for an immediate
remedying of this condition.
The economy of the fuel consumption, I
according to Edwin S. Cramp, was due ,
to the rigid discipline In the fireroom ;
and the excellence of the boilers. The
firemen distributed the coal regularly ;
and evenly with the result that the j
boilers steamed freely. At no time was '
there an attempt made to race the boat, ;
although Cramp stated at the end of
the trip that he was confident that the,
Pennsylvania could have made an aver- I
age of 23 knots. j
There was much Interest In compar- j
ing her effort to-day with that of her !
consort, the Colorado, which preceded j
her from the Cramps' yard only a j
month before. "While the latter made j
a 6.6-knot spurt at a rate of 23.294 j
per hour, her average for the entire :
course of eighty-eight miles was 22.25
knots, compared with the Pennsyl
vania's 22.43 knots.
The day was perfect for the trial, a ;
moderate breeze at the start falling to Â¦
a flat calm at the finish, while the sea i
throughout was very smooth. Â¦ Al- j
though the Pennsylvania started slow- j
ly, being nearly a quarter of a knot j
below her requirement over the first
two legs of the course; she gathered j
headway as she went on and over one â¢
leg of five miles of the forty-four to;
the turn averaged 22.53 knots an hour.
Her builders. "William Cramp & Son â¢
of Philadelphia, made no attempt Â¦
throughout the trial to push this, their j
greatest vessel, but on the other hand;
bent their energies to exceed the Gov- ;
eminent requirement with the most J
economic expenditure of fuel possible, j
Her trial was therefore the first of the j
numerous tests over the Cape Ann |
course where speed was not the object !
sought for. \
BOSTON, Nov. 21â The armored \

called for 22 knots, and her average j
speed for the four hours' trial was ;
22.43 knots per hour, while her coal J
consumption was 2.2 pounds per horse- j

About six wertts before Mis3 Dolbecr
met her death in New York Dr. Morris
Herzstein of this city attended a din
ner party with her in Paris and ho tes
tified yesterday that she was unques
tionably of so^nd mind at that time.
The opinion had the weight. of one
Â«'ho has had experience in treatment
of nervous and mental diseases. His
testimony was strongly reinforced by.
Miss Mary Josselyn, who war with
Miss Dolbeer every* day in the French
capital and in her company enjoyed
many of its attractions.
The trial of the will contest is at
tracting more interest and the court
room wag crowded yesterday to its full
capacity. Society was apain well rep
resented, and a good beginning was
made in taking the testimony of those
with whom Mies Dolbeer associated.
Judge Coffees sallies of wit and the
sharp conflict of the attorneys tend
to alleviate the distress occasioned by
the stuffy atmosphere of a room in
which proper ventilation is impossible.
An adjournment was taken to Mon
day morning while Mies Josselyn was
ctill on the stand. No one ventures to
predict when the trial will be ended.
Counsel for proponents declare that the
cross-examinations are unnecessarily
long, but the attorneys for the con
testant are prompt with the retort
courteous that Pillsbury has no regard
for time in the conduct of direct ex
aminations.
Besides the testimony of the two wit
nesses concerning the health and men
tal condition of Miss Dolbeer during
her stay In Paris Just before her life
came to an end in New York, there
was testimony of three witnesses who
told r.f her eood mental poise and the
enjoyment she was finding: in life dur
ing the months and years preceding
her departure on her last trip to Eu
rni>e. TbesÂ» witnesses were John D.
Spreckels. Miss Grace Spreckels and
Miss Mary Jolliffe.
coxverski> ixtelijgkxtly:
Dr. Herrstefn was ILe fir6t called in
the morning and he testified that in
either the latter part of May or early
in June of th<Â» present year he met
Miss Dolberr at a u.nner given by
Mrs. Hotaling in Paris. Miss Dolbeer
was his companion at the table and he
engaged in conversation with her for
two or three hours on general topics,
about Paris and San Francisco.
"She tpoJie very intelligently on all
FUbJects." said the doctor, "and was
thoroughly rational â as rational as any
person could be.''
"It Is my opinion that MUÂ«s Dolbeer
was of perfectly sound mind when I
saw her." waÂ» Dr. Herzstein's answer
to the qurry cf counsel.
When cross-examined he said that
one experienced in mental and nervouj
diseases as he waÂ« could usually dis
cover in a conversation of an hour or
two whether there was any weakness
of mind.
Hiram Johnson made much of the
fait that the witness was not familiar
with works on insanity that the at
torney has been studying for the case.
John D. Spreckels, who was the next
witness, said he knew Miss Dolbeer for
about twelve years, met her frequently
when she visited his home, was one of
several automobile and picnic parties in
which she participated and the close
acquaintanceship continued till her de
parture for Europe.
"Miss Dolbeer was certainly of sound
mind," declared the witness in response
to a question. "I never had reason to
think otherwise. I met her often and
Fhe was always rational. She was of a
very good disposition, indeed. She was
Inclined to be quiet, but at times would
unbend and be lively."
In driving an automobile Miss Dol
beer was an expert, the witness said.
Qualifications for which are nerve, self
possession and vigilance.
IJVELY IX SOCIETY.
Miss Grace Spreckels followed her
father on the stand. She was an inti
mate friend of Miss Dolbeer and often
â¢went into society with her. Their homes
being but a block apart, they were
often together. To combat the allega
tion that Miss Dolbeer suffered from
melancholia severely the last year of
her life. Miss Spreckels was asked to
tell of the numerous social affairs they
both attended durin? that time and Into
which, said the witness. Miss Dolbeer
at all timrs entered with zest. Miss
Dolbeer continued to enjoy herself so
ciaJly up to the time she left for Eu
rope.

mind, and never had the slightest occa-

WITNESSES WHO MET BERTHA DOLBEER

DR. MORRIS' HERZSTEIN met Miss Dolbeer at a dinner party in Paris about six weeks before
her death, and he was positive in the opinion he expressed to thejury yesterday that ! her~mind
was perfectly sound at that time. Miss Mary Josselyn, who was also in Paris last June, gave testimony
to the same effect. A number of intimate friends, who often came in contact with the young heiress
in this city, testified that they never noticed the slightest indications of insanity.

King to his rightful owner.
It is explained that Morgan gave or

horses, to pasture. The coachman by
mistake sent King, believing it to be
High Tide. When Morgan- returned
from Europe he gave orders that High
Tide should be sold, so King was sold

2148 Center street, Nov. 23.
The ax which has hung over the
heads of various members of the senior
class at the university, who are cred
ited with responsibility for the riot on
the campus a few weeks ago, fell to
day and found a victim in William T.
Hale, one of the most prominent men
lu the university. Hale was informed
by President Wheeler this morning
that he has been suspended until Au
gust, 1905.
Hale is editor of the Daily Califor
cian, a student publication which
prints tbe news of university affairs
and is controiled and edited by col
legians. The editorial policy of Hale,
with regard to the dispute between
Captain Nance, military instructor at
the university, and the senior class
which objected strenuously to Nance's
inarching orders, is responsible for the
young editor's suspension. The stu
ients' affairs committee considered his
case a week ago, summoned him to ex
plain his conduct, heard his explana
tions and defense and then recommend
ed his suspension for a time that equals'
a college year.
The fate of fourteen other seniors
still hanps in the balance, forty-eight
of the sixty-three who were originally
In disgrace having been placed on pro
bation by order of President Wheeler
yesterday on Captain Nance's recom
mendation. Each of the fourteen anx
iously awaits news of the action to be
taken in his particular case-
President Wheeler called Hale into
his office shortly before noon, and in
formed him of his fate. Later the
president said: "Mr. Hale is suspend
ed upon the recommendation of the
etudents' affairs committee, which con
sidered that his two editorials preced
ing the disturbance on the campus
Â« ere partly responsible for the trouble."
Professor W. A. Setchell of the stu
dents' affairs committee which convict
ed Hale, was on the campus during the
riot and tried to preserve order.
Professor Setchell, at Hale's hearing,
cited Hale's editorial in which he re
ferred to the military class as a mil
itary kindergarten and to Captain
Nance as a "schoolmaster." informing
Hale that the entire tone of his edi
torial had encouraged the seniors to
rebel as they did.
Hale talked a few days ago of carry
ing the cases of classmen who might
be dismissed from college as a sequel
to the riot to tbe academic senate and
appealing to that court of last resort.
He said to-day, however, that he has
no complaint to make and will not
contest the action of the -.university
authorities. He resides at San^ Diego
and will leave at once for his home.
His place as editor of the Daily Cali
fornian will be taken temporarily by'

< OAKLAND, Nov." 23.â To-morrow, whether
we have anything to be particularly thankful
for or not, we will all observe the old and
pleasant if somewhat pagan custom of sac
rificing the proud gobbler in annual thanks
giving to the gods that have smiled benignly
upon us since our appetite for turkey was last
appeased. Teas and card clubs are forgotten
to*- the nonce and many a well-known society
woman's superintending, with unusual and un
reserved pleasure, the preparations for the
yearly dinner, that to be really good must
include the old-fashioned dishes that "mother
used to make." The number of society women
who are really artists in the way of concocting
a noteworthy meal Is surprising, and the day
seems not lar off when belles will boast of
their housewifely ability.

According to a decision of the- Su
preme Court Just handed.down former
Mayor R. W. . Snow must return
$186832 to the city treasury. During
his incumbency as City Auditor he re
tained $7868 32 as fees on collec
tions made by him on personal, prop
erty taxes. Suit was begun against
him. but it was found that the statute
of limitations had operated against
$6000 of the amount and shutting out
all except the amount for which Judg
ment has been rendered.
The case was first tried before Judge
S. P. Hall, who found in favor of the
city, stating that all Snow was entitled
to was his salary of ?3000 a year and
that he was not entitled to any. money
for fees. The case was appealed from
this decision and the Supreme Court
has now affirmed the decision. It is
presumed that the amount of the judg
ment must come from Snow's- bonds
men, the Fidelity and Guaranty Coni
pany of Maryland.

Mr. Hershey's bulletin outlines the
bedrock geology and the gecmorpho
geny of the region, and includes a de
tailed description of the various ter
race remnants with a summary of their
characteristic features and differences.
Concerning the age of the terraces, Mr.
Hershey says:
I arbitrarily reduce the assigned age of the
highest terrace to 250,000 years. Tbe portion
of the Sierran Canyon above the 850- foot ter
race is more than three times as deep as that
below, several times as wice, and has charac
teristics indicating a mucli creater age. It is
undoubtedly conservative to assign it a period
of erosion not more than three times as great
as the age of the highest terrace, or 75O.OC0
years. This yields a. total nge for the Sierran
Canyon of 1,000,000 years, and that figure also
represents my idea of the probable length of
the Quaternary era.
The oherwood Valley has the appearance of
being at least flvft times as old as the Sierran
Canyon, or 5,000,000 years. The geologists who
are working the Pacifir Coast country are in
dined to assign much longer periods of dura
tion to the Pliocene and Pleistocene than do
tho^e whose field lteS In the Eastern, Stnte*.
Recently Dr. A. C. Lawson has given as a
posV.bl* duration for Quaternary time â¢_'. /.*>., 000
y*arÂ». However, tie includes in the Quater
nary the period of erosion of a series of '"high
valleys" of the Upper Kern Basin, which valleys .
appear to me 1 to be the correlatives of the
Sherwood valleys of the Klamath region. My
figure corrÂ«.pj>ondins to hia given above Is C
000,000 years. â¢ ... â¢
After delving deep into the secrets of
the river terraces of the Orleans Basin
in California, Oscar Hershey of the ge
ological department of the university
has put the results of his investigation
in a lengthy and exhaustive bulletin
issued to-day from the press of the uni
versity. Mr. Hershey says of the river
terraces problem:
During the flirt fÂ«w years of my residence In
California rtie river terraces did net appear. to
present any inter'sting problems, but tho deeper
I delve Into their history the more fascinating
grows the study. They are important because
they indicate o!oi?enlc disturbances end chants
of climate, and because by means of them Â»e
will be furnished the best chronometer cf gla
cial events. It is possible that they may yield
facts bearing strongly on the cause of the great
Quaternary They furnish the basis
for the classification of Quaternary land faunas.
Further, the relics of early man in California
may be referred to the different terraces and
thus some Idea gained of tneir relative ages.
So far. in the Orleans Basin, I have failed to
secure authentic evidence of the presence of
man until after the completion of the 45-foot
terrace.

much note in society circles. . The
large drill hall had been superbly
decorated. Just before 9 o'clock',
while the myriads of electric ' lights
wtfre being tested, a flash of flame
startled the soldiers. A flare from a
gas jet communicated with the decor

In an instant the east side of the

in flames. Quickly an alarm was
sounded that brought out the Fire
Department. The lights were/ shut

SAXTA CLARA. Xov. 23. â The pre
sentation of "The Light Eterna!," by
Martin V. Merle, at Santa Clara Col
lege theater this evening crowded
that playhouse with a fashionable and
enthusiastic audience. The new pro
duction ranks among the leading
miracle plays, and. aside from '.'Xaza
reth." the passion play written for the
college by Clay M. Greene, excels any
thing ever presented at the mission
school. The action of the play, which
Is laid within the shadow of the
Eternal City and during the time in
tervening between 302 and 307, A. D..
shows deep study upon the part of
the author. The dramatic story,
charming characters, gorgeous cos
tumes, unique scenic and electrical
effects and beautiful music thrilled
the audience. That rehearsals were
not slighted was evidenced by the
clever acting of the college boys, and
they, with Father Kenna, president of
the college, and other members of the
faculty, were highly praised for the
presentation of the plar to-night.
The plot of the play is based on the
life and death of Pancratius. and
deals with his persecution. Gerald P.
Beaumont as Pancratius was faultless,
as was the acting of John J. Ivanco
vich as Diocletian, the Roman Emper
or, and William McKagney as Corvi
nus. afterward Prefect of Rome. There
are six scenes. The first is the at
trium of the house of Dionysius. over
looking the River Tiber, and a gor
geous sunset is a feature of it. It Is
followed by scenes of the court of
Corvintis, the palace of the Emperor
Diocletian, the sanctifleation In the
Mamertime prison, and closes with
the sacrifice in the Colosseum. The
last act Is the grandest and most ef
fective. In the presence of a jeering
crowd Pancratius makes his simple
declaration of faith before the pagan
rabble. Diocletian loses his patience
and calls for the beasts. Shrieks of
the crowd, clanging of the cage,
and then a beam of silvery light /rom
above shows the mangled form of the
martyr, Pancratius. A ' panther
crouches over the boy with its claws
fastened In his throat. Standing over
him an anrel holds In one hand a
cross, while the other points to a
snow white dove, which flutters above.

NEW YORK, Xov. 23. â Total ab
stainers in the matter of spirituous and
malt liquors are likely, in the near
future, to be piven special low rates
by the leading life insurance com
panies. As is well known, the Insur
ance companies never issue policies
to immoderate drinkers where the cir
cumstances are known, but for many
years numerous authorities have
claimed that the average span of life
was longer among persons who were
not total abstainers and the under
writers have never taken a decided
stand in the matter.
Xow. however. It is stated that a
number of actuaries and medical di
rectors have been working on statis
tics running over a period of several
years and from the records of a large
number of life insurance companies
several of the authorities have come
to the conclusion that the total ab
stainers as a class live longer by from
20 to 50 per cent than the moderate
drinkers as a class.

SAX RAFAEL, Xov. 23.â A battle
royal is on between the shrimp fishers
of the Point San Pedro Shrimp Com
pany and the fishers of the San Mateo
Shrimp Company. The trouble is the
outcome of the refusal of the health
authorities to permit shrimps caught
in the southern part of the bay being
put upon the market. The San Mateo
Shrimp Company wanted the San
1 Pedro Company to divide the shrimps
I caught "by th? former company, but
I met with a refusal and the trouble
1 began.
It is alleged that fishermen of the
i San Mateo Company cut the nets ot
I the San Pedro Company under cover
! of darkness and the latter company
I has had men patrolling the bay in
te.iineh.es to protect the nets. Two
j launches were seen near Point San
! Pedro last night trolling with nets.
' Both sides opened fire and it Is re-
I ported that one" of the launches of the

that begins to-morrow night and ex

evidence of the growing appreciation of
the values of history. The objects of
thÂ« new organization are the advance- (

Coast. Now. fc r the latter phase the \

ly to be thanked, as California, history
has until very recently been thought
too neÂ» â like r:ueh cf its wine â for im- 1

spectable old year of 1542. with a couple i

BY LAURA BRIDE POWERS.
Embassador Porter's speech on the
upbuilding of the American navy was
enthusiastically received. He spoke of
the navy's exploits since 1S12 and urged
that Congress preserve the historic ship
Constitution. He emphasized the the
ory that a strong navy is the surest
guarantee of the nation's peace.
The speech of Baron d'Estournelles
de Constant was significant from the
fact that he was a member of The
Hague tribunal. He said the United
States had within the last three years
given Europe remarkable evidence &f
its power in shaping events which con
stitute the world's advancement. When
The Hague tribunal had been almost
forgotten and intentionally ignored.
President Roosevelt brought it back to
life by referring to it the Mexico-Cali
fornia case (the Pious "claim). States
men of Europe considered this as an
effort to resuscitate The Hague tribu
nal, and it speedily led to the submis
sion of the more Important case of
Great Britain. Germany and Italy
against Venezuela. The Hague court,
thus saved, the speaker said, made
steady progress, the latest result being
the submission of the Anglo-Russian
crisis to arbitration.
Baron d'Estournelles de Constant,
after graphically portraying the hor
rors of the war in the Far East, de
clared that the enlightened policy of the
United States gave hopes that even
that great tragedy will be stopped. He
closed with a toast to the success of
President Roosevelt's proposition for
a second meeting of The Hague confer
ence. ' The speech, which was Im
promptu, was heartily applauded.
PARIS, Nov. 23.â The Thanksgiving
eve banquet at the American Club,
at which prominent Frenchmen and
Americans were guests, brought out a
notable demonstration for a strong
navy, and at the same time an elo
quent tribute from Baron d'Estour
nelles de Constant to the part the
United States is taking in the world's
affairs and particularly in the mainte
nance of the world's peace. The ban
quent was held in the superb new
quarters of the Travelers" Club in the
Champs Elysees. The guests included
Embassador Porter, Baron d'Estour
nelles de Constant. Admiral Watson,
Professor Barrett Wendell of Harvard;
Dr. Trousy. dean of the University of
Paris, and over a hundred members of
the American colony.

JJTTUICATXOJrS AT PXOX XXZXT BAMEKSSOM.But no girl is going to be a matri
monial success unless she cultivates her
head and hands as well as her heart.
She .will need the full powers of all
three after she is married if she pulls
fair in the domestic harness. Love
never yet ran a household capably un
assisted. And even if it could, what
would be the sense of overworking
one's heart when one's head and hands
Of course, 'tis true -fundamentally
that a woman's sex is her book of fate.
Her greatest' happiness and her noblest
career is in marriage and motherhood
and in helping to bring up her grand
children. And love is the means to all
this.
I do not put much faith in "the whole
existence" theory. Spiritually, love is
a beautiful inspiration; practically, it
Is the best working hypothesis in the
world for a woman's endeavors; es
thetically, it is her crown of beauty.
But it is not all that there is of life by
any means.
There is a great deal of foolishness
in a girl's or even a woman's attitude
toward love. Both give it an undue im
portance In their lives. They are hypo
chrondriacsjso far as this one malady is
concerned. "* They have been told so
often, and feel that they are not living
up to their privileges unless they are
enjoying its pleasing pangs every min
ute, whether they can well spare the
time for it or not.
IN love, a girl's fancy needs the curb
more often than it needs the spur.
It is high-Btrungj impatient, aquiv
er with eagerness for the open road.
It does not have either real work
enough, or the right kind of fodder to
make it reliable.
But usually it gets the spur.' So reck
lessly do women ride, so careless are
they of consequences. Most of them
are such poor horsewomen, in fact, that
they do not even realize that if they
were better riders they would take no
unnecessary chances.
Phe has permitted her daughter to
grow up in an atmosphere _ of false
sentiment. Too much sentiment is
false* in Itself, for it is not true to
life as we really live it. And sh,e has
let her learn what love is without first
learning what life is. She has not
kept before her child's eyes a fine
ideal of womanhood â a womanhood
that loves and thinks and works with
the same breath, the sarn^ hope, the
same Joy and the same sorrow. She
has not treasured the girlish confi
dence which nature gave into her
keeping as a holy trust. Her head, as
much as her unhappy child's heart,
has allowed itself to be led astray.
This may either make her unwise in
her choice of a husband or it may
work, another evil, which, to my
thinking, is less to be deplored.
When a girl feels at 16 or 17 that
her#heart is broken â and many a one
does feel so, alas! â has nobody any
responsibility In "the matter except
herself and the man who hurt her?
Doesn't the mother come in for some
share of it? I think" she does.
stood ready either to take turns or to
share home burdens?
This article is not meant for an ar
gument for the so-called higher edu
cation of women, or for special train
ing in domestic science. I still stand
on the ground of love. I am merely
trying to call attention in my own
way to that truth which Emerson ex
presses when he says that the atmos
phere of the affections is always liable
to mirages.
One of the greatest things that a
girl faces when she enters young
womanhood is her liability to fancy
herself In love. She knows that fall
ing in love is one of the feats expect
ed of her. And everything that she
has ever heard or read about the ex
perience leads her to believe in its de
sirability. Every influence upon her
tends to make her overemotlonal and
oversentimental.

In General Stoessel's determination to
die like a rat in that doomed' citadel
at Port Arthur? Now that he has
made all the defense that any brave
man could, wouldn't it be much bet
ter for him and the heroes about him
to live for the Czar, rather than reck
lessly die for him? â Cleveland Plain
Dealer.
General Stoessel's pathetic weekly
farewells to the Czar, coupled with
the tragic assurance that Port Arthur
Is his tomb, look at this distance
less like the nervy resolve of a sol
dier than they do like tearful sugges
tions that he ought to be told to sur
render the place, at least if he thought
it would, soon fall anyway. If that is
his game it is a losing one. St. Peters
burg willingly credits him with great
heroism, but coolly says nothing about
surrender. â Chicago Chronicle.

THE CALL is glad to learn from the Sacramento Valley that
the beet sugar project at Colusa is not abandoned as, was re
ported, but will be taken up later. The production of sugar
beets and the manufacture of beet sugar are not experiments in
California. Everywhere this industry has been tried it is successful.
It is profitable to the owners of the mills and to the farmers, who get
mpre profit out of their lands and diversify their crops, than which
there is no greater blessing for an agricultural community.
The mills already in operation in this State are from Alameda
County southward, clear into Southern California. Because the
enterprise lined southward from its start at Alvarado, there may
have been generated the idea that it will not flourish in the Sacra
mento Valley! But this is a mistake. That valley has just as good
sugar lands as any in the State, and should not be under the ban.
It would pay the whole valley to contribute to the Colusa project, for
the sake of removing any misapprehension on the subject. Wherever
sugar beets are raised land values increase. In Idaho, from Pocatello
northeastward, there is a line of beet sugar mills, and land values
and rentals have been wonderfully stimulated by their success. If
the sugar beet will do that in Idaho, at an altitude of 5000 feet, it
should do it in a higher degree in the rich Sacramento Valley.
If the Colusa project is suspended through the indisposition of
the farmers to contract acreage they should by committees inquire
into the effect of beet culture in the places where it is established.
If it is a labor problem and farmers fear they cannot get the kind
and quantity of labor they want and when they want it they should*
say so, make their statement and argument and let the whole State
consider it, if such general consideration be needed to solve what
ever problem is holding back this desirable addition to the indus
tries of a fine valley, that has been too much neglected.

ery. There were tears in her eyes
now, and they were ' not bitter tears.
She began to feel strangely content.
The Idea that Herman might fail to
produce the viands for the feast never
entered her head. Somehow or other
he had always accomplished what he
started to do, ever since the day he
had braved Farmer Green's bull to
steal for her a certain red cheeked ap
ple which she coveted.
When she heard Herman's step at
the door she was just putting the
chrysanthemum he had brought her to
wear into a slender vaae to grace the
center of the table.
As she flung open the door she fairly
gasped. The â¢ bundle he carried In
either arm rose above his shoulder. She
sat down weakly on a flat-topped truhk
by the "kithen- table" to watch him un
pack the bundles. He checked off each
package.

In this land we may well be thankful for the institutions of lib
erty, for the common schools in which the children of the people
mingle and get their first lesson in human nature, and learn that
brotherhood which in after life protects them from class appeals and
class prejudice. We may be thankful for the abundance of nature's
store and for the industry which converts it to the use of man and
distributes it with equity. We may be thankful for the good and
orderly temper of the people who compete for control of a free gov
ernment, in amity and order,- and accept the decision of the ma
jority without heartburning or grudge. And, above all, we may be
thankful that our industry, \\*rought upon nature's store, gives us
such, surplus of those things necessary for existence that we hear
the far cry of distress from the ends of the earth where men perish
of famine, and answer it out of our abundance. For this and the
undying spirit of mercy and charity within us, let there be thanks.
To-day is. in a sense, the close of the season's productive work,
set at a time when its results are known, its harvests gathered and
its hope fulfilled. Peace has been with us, and our Government has
been the promoter of peace on earth and good will toward men.
May all the years to come be as good to us and to all men, and may
the republic resist in the spirit of brotherhood all attempts to over
throw libertv in the clash of class and faction.
Had man remained a troglodyte, each concerned only in the
comfort of his own cave and busied only with the getting of the
game that fed him, there would have been no civilization. It was
the development of a sense of interdependence that obsoleted indi
vidual and class selfishness, and made civilization and liberty possi
ble. With each advance men were drawn closer to each other in
things of common interest, and finally when the blessings and bene
fits from nature's store, that were taken by the single man at first
as the spoil of fleet foot and strong hand, were bestowed with fair
equality upon all. in the mass of humanity the selfish glorification of
individual skill and strength gave way to a common feeling of thank
fulness to the common source of every good and perfect gift neces
sary to man's existence.
" Those who are united in a brotherhood of thankfulness are one
also in respect to all things that make for the common good, and
they are one in support of that liberty which man now claims as his
birthright. That this spirit is necessary to the maintenance of lib
erty was well put by President Roosevelt in his introduction of Mr.
Wagner to a Washington audience on last Tuesday. Speaking of
the brotherhood of man the President said: "No republic can per
manently exist when it becomes a republic of classes â when the
man feels not the interest of the whole people, but only the interest
of the particular class to which he belongs, or fancies he belongs,
35 being of prime importance. In antiquity republics failed as they
did because they tended to become either a republic of the few who
exploited the many, or a republic of the many who plundered the
few. and in either case the end of the republic was never in doubt,
just so in one case as in the other, and no more so in one case than
in the other."
In that brotherhood that will not have classes among men this
republic was founded. In that- brotherhood it has passed from ado
lescence to power, and to-day, mighty among the mighty, its people
in brotherhood join hearts in thankfulness for all the gifts of the
vear. In no part of our vast domain is suffering left without succor
if men know it to exist. None need starve, none need perish of cold,
except by accident or concealment dictated by pride, for everywhere,
in all our great cities and smaller centers of population, the spirit
of brotherhood, expressed by an amazing number of organizations, is
abroad to relieve the needy and cheer the unhappy. Man. the cave
dweller, no longer gnaws his bone in selfish isolation, unthankfully.
He is one of a great family.
FROM the most ancient times until now men have had set times
and seasons in which to express gratitude and thanks for the
gifts of nature, which come to them from a source beyond
their ken and their control. It is a part of that feeling in all mem
bers of the race that there is a power, some say natural and some
say supernatural, that is greater than man.
The subject for thought that is opened out by that feeling is
one cause of civilization. The Chaldean shepherds who watched
their flocks by night and contemplated the stars above them were
wonderfully stimulated to thoughtfulness. They realized something
of the greatness of the physical universe, and learned at last to
separate the planets, which changed their position, from the fixed
stars that seemed immovable. In the elevation of thought that fol
lowed astronomy had its origin, and civilization took a step forward.
So it has been "whenever man has gained a higher conception of
the living things around him, and of the great manifestations of
nature in the whole universe.
How they had both stood in the door
way that last Thanksgiving night for a
final glance at the^Jear old room! And
the next time they had entered it, how
everything had changed! Death, des
olation, the village auctioneer and the
foreclosure of the mortgage, all these
had come to the little farm in less than
twelve months. The two years that
Janet had spent in the big city deny
ing herself everything, working in an
office during the day and in her studio
room at night to send home interest
money for the mortgage, now repre
sented just so much wasted time.
They had both come from Center
vine, she as a typewritist and he as a
bookkeeper â both fresh from business
college. The mighty city had de
manded much of their country vitality
and energy, so that they had seen very
little of each other, considering that
they had come from the same town, yet
somehow both had felt comforted in
the thought that the other was within
reach of messenger or telephone.
Janet had lived very much to herself
and her typewriter table, but Herman
had managed to see more of the city
and see more of the city's ways. That
was why he had discovered a desirable
restaurant where he could secure their
table d'hote dinner for Thanksgiving
day at the moderate price of 60 cents
each.
Now he tried to speak cheerfully and
to avoid looking at the hands that
trembled and the eyes that would fill
in spite of Janet's strenuous efforts
to maintain her composure.
"Hurry up, Janet!" he said; "the
Ramona fills up early, you know."
"I would not care if every table was
taken," she replied impulsively. "Oh,
forgive me, Herman, when you are so
kind to think of me to-day, but
Thanksgiving dinner in a restaurantâ
you know that seems only for the
homeless ones, and it makes me realize
more than ever that I belong to that
class now."
She looked around the room in
which she had gathered the few family
heirlooms brought down from the
farm. It did not look homeless to Her
man, and its possibilities as the scene
of the Thanksgiving dinner were
brought to mind as he caught sight of
the haijdle of a chafing dish, sticking
out from the cretonne cupboard cur
tain.
"I say. Janet, we won't go out. We'll
cook dinner right here."
She sat down very suddenly and
stared at him.
"Start Thanksgiving dinner at 12
o'clock?" she asked half bitterly. "And
will you please tell me how you can
cook a dinner by the aid of one oil
stove, not guaranteed to work, and a
chafing dish built for two?"
"Dead easy," was his reply, as he
"That noise down In the street!
Those gamins tooting horns and beg
ging for pennies. It's so different from
last year."
The man did not answer at once, but
he understood. He could see it all, the
big dining-room at the farm, the large
table in the center with its vivid red
cloth and green shaded lamp, flanked
on one side by plates of apples and
nuts, and on the other by copies of
â¢"The American Farmer" and "The
Ransom County Herald."
Â£ ( â¢""> LOSE the window. I cannot
I stand it!" said the girl,
V-^ thrusting her hatpin back
and forth in the velvet with
trembling fingers.
The man did as he was told and then
turned to her wonderingly.
"Can't stand what?" he asked. Â¦*.
Before she could ask any more ques
tions the door closed behind him. Me
chanically she removed her hat and
reached for the gingham apron which
she; used when preparing her break
fasts and luncheons. Her dinners she
always took at a nearby restaurant.
She lifted the typewriter from its table
and hid it in the closet. Then she
spread a newspaper over the table.
That would do for the culinary depart
ment, she argued.
She removed the student lamp from
the center table and spread upon it a
square piece of plain linen, handed
down by Grandmother Harris. Then
she went to a> trunk which she had
never opened since the day it left the
farm, and, one by one, she lifted out
the treasured pieces of family crock-
buttoned up his overcoat and reached
for his hat. "You fill the oil stove and
get the chafing dish ready, and set out
your table, and I'll do the rest."
A reception at the Simpson home
followed the ceremony. To this nearly
200 guests were bidden.
The bride's .table, rich with dressing
of white flowers, was extremely attrac-
; The groom, a young divine of Kioto,
Japan, met Miss Simpson during Jier
visit to her hister, the wife of Bishop
Partridge, also living in Kioto. !
Yesterday's wedding is the outcome
of their meeting and acquaintance.
The bride, gowned in white, em
broidered with the Japanese wistaria,
was attended by her sister, Miss
Amalia Simpsom, and Miss Helen Part
ridge.
Rev. Cecil Montague Marracks
served the groom, F. W. Dixon and Dr.

profusion of these same flowers.
St. Luke's was the scene of a

A wedding attracting wide attention
and characterized by many brilliant
features was that yesterday of Miss
Gertrude Eells and Lieutenant John
Franklin Babcock in Trinity Church.
The position held by these ypung peo
ple, together with their Immense per
sonal popularity, attracted a great
number of friends to the ceremony, for
genuine interest "impelled attendance.
The bride, beautifully gowned in bro
caded white, was attended by her six
bridesmaids, dressed In shaded yellow
chiffon creations. Miss Dorothy Eells,
maid of honor, wore white with yellow
embroideries. The groom was served by
John Sheppard Eells as best man. At

the bride with her father, who gave
her away, the ceremony being per
formed bv Rev. Dr. Frederick Clam
pett. The home of Mr. and Mrs. Eells
was then thrown open to the large
number of friends, who followed with
congratulations for Lieutenant and
Mrs. Babcock. They will reside in San
Francisco after a wedding Jpurney, for
the young lieutenant Is stationed in
town.
The wedding of Mi?s Susan PAtton
and Dr. Le Moyne Wills was surround

And that is why Herman Blake has
always maintained . that while most
men win their brides by the aid of the
florist or candy maker, he wooed Janet
through a delicatessen shop.
(Copyright, 1904, by Geo. W. Sargent.)
"Well," he maintained^ stoutly, "it is
considerably better than poor restaur
ant food, and when Scollard & Co.
wake up to an appreciation of my real
worth you can queen it over a real flat
and a real maid."
"I think I will try the prescription."
He had stepped picking over the
nuts now, and his hands were clasped
under the table. He did not want her
to see that they were shaking. He had
made the plunge so suddenly.
"I don't think this room is just what
we ought to have, but we can get a
nice little flat of three or four room's,
and you would not N have to stop your
work so long as ypu like it so much,
but we could make sure the front room
was cheerful and light for you to write
in. I think it's a sure cure for liome
slckness for both of us."
She sat staring at him, at first stolid
ly, then gradually the color came into
her cheeks, and the expression on her
face changed.
"I don't understand," sh*. said, but
Herman knew that she understood him
perfectly. â .
"I am just offering you a prescrip
tion signed H. Blake, M. D., to be
taken three times a day, breakfast,
dinner and supper â a husband and- a
cozy little flat."
Janet was regaining her composure.
"With delicatessen cooking:?"
"Do you know," Bhe said wonder
lngly, "I never supposed this place
could be so much like home."
"Home Is what people make it â
what two people make it," he cor
rected. . Â¦
While the soup cooked in the chafing
dish the potatoes and the gravy were
all heated In a big saucepan over the
oil stove, nnd wl.en the soup was
served the benns took its place in the
chafing dish. And the two young peo
ple, who hnd forgotten to X.-. homesick
and heartsick, seated themselves at
either end of a ridiculously small
Thanksgiving dinner table.
At last they sat over their nuts and
raisins. Last year they had eaten
them in front of a, blazing fire. In
stinctively Janet glanced toward a ra
diator in a distant corner of the. room.
It did not look cheerful, but the steam
was escaping merrily from the valve,
and that was something to be thankful
for. Then she looked back at Herman;
she ought to be thankful for him, too.
She gave a little sigh of contentment.
He looked up quickly. It sounded" like
old times.
"Herman, that cost you more than a
table d'hote dinner would, and now
how are we going to cook it?"
"Most of it was choked at the deli
catessen shop, and haven't we two
stoves, . or as. good as two stoves?
Draw out that oil contraption of
yours." , ' .
She sprang to her feet. In a few
moments the tea kettle was boiling and
the water was ready to ; pour over the
ooffee in the little French pot which
was then left to drip. The cranberry
sauce and the re9t of the cold dishes
were set forth in brave array .on the
china from the farm.
pickled onions, two turkey drumsticks,
ditto slices of white meat, stuffing and
gravy, one tin pail of cranberry Jelly,
one wooden dish filled with mashed po
tatoes, one can lima beans, one stalk
celery, one mince pie (just see how
thick it Is. with real raisins), one sack
of nuts (have you got a hammer?) and
two apples."
Janet looked at the remarkable com
bination with eyes turned suddenly
grave.

Greet Players to Appear.
For many years past these good ser
vitors of the poor have followed this
beautiful custom and thus the Joy of
anticipation prepares the little ones for
the Joys of a real Thanksgiving. The
tables are spread in the assembly hall
and are gladdened with loads of blos
soms and ferns, arranged with most
exquisite careâ not less than graces to
day the tables of the rich. The chil
dren will dine to-day at 2:30 p. m. and
there will be there to see that they
eat within the bounds of safety many
pretty society girls, who have decided
to abandon the pursuit of more ordi
nary pleasures to jnake the, little ones
Ixappy and to be happy with them.
And of these turkeys, whether pur
chased for 30 or for 10 cents' a pound,
hundreds of thousands of people will
dine in San Francisco to-day. Feasts
for little ones and feasts for the poor
have been prepared and doubtlessly
will be enjoyed- Some of these events
promise to be most "picturesque, es
pecially one at the home of the Sisters
of the Holy Family at the corner of
Hayes and Fillmore streets,' where 700
little tykes, lucky little lads and lassies,
will d'ine, the good sisters their hos
tesses.
No one has complaint to make but
the turkey man and even his is a self
ish complaint. When the week opened
the retailers of the good American bird
were piling up small fortunes on a
charge of 30 tents a pound for any
thing from a thin-chested hen to a
wheat-stuffed gobbler. But yesterday
morning their end came. Seventy tons
of turkeys marched into the market
from Oregon ami things began to
shake. Then some California farmers
that had about eighty tons more to
dispose of tossed them on top of the
quaking market and it broke like a
house of cards beneath the weight.
In half an hour turkeys dropped
from 30 cents to 20, then to 15, then to
12Vi and then in some places to 10
cents a pound. The result was that
every peddler that could borrow a
wa^on or a basket became a turkey
dealer. The retail markets held up as
long as they could under the competi
tion, but finally came down with the
slump and passed out turkeys over the
counter at a price below that usually
charged for tough round steak. It was
an unhappy day for the turkey men,
but a glad one for those that toil and
need to .husband their resources.
FEASTS FOR EVERYBODY.
And nowhere in this broad land can
greater cause for thankfulness be
found than in California. In the year
Just closed this State made remark
able advancement in every material
branch that goes to make, for the
wealth and comfort of those that live
within her borders. And in San Fran
cisco, her metropolis, the signs of
progress are everywhere and in every
home there will be celebration.
To-day, in accordance with the proc
lamation of the President of the Unit
ed States, the people of this favored
land will offer up thanks for the for
tunes of a year that has just passed
into history. It has been a year nota
ble for its prosperity and marked by
the content of the whole American peo
ple.
Special Thanksgiving services will be
held at many of the city's churches to

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 3.â The scene
that followed to-day's game Â¦was the
wildest that ever .took place on the
local grounds. The chief feature of
the game was the questionable deci
sions against the local te.am by Umpire
Brown. As a result Brown was slapped
in the face by^ Flood in the second
inning, knocked down by Frank
Chance at the end of the eighth, when
the game was called on account of
darkness, and almost mobbed by a
crowd of several hundred. The .trouble
began in the second inning, when
Flood slapped Brown in the;face with
his glove and was sent to the bench.

Chance hooked- a terrific left to
Brown's face, cutting his cheek badly
and sending him staggering against a
bystander. Brown attempted to fight
back, but another left on the Jaw sent
him to his knees. He grasped Chance
about the legs and at this moment two
policemen ended hostilities.
The two policemen took Brown by
the arms and started with him for the
gate. The mob was frantic and cush
ion seats were thrown at the umpire,
more than one striking him in the
back. The jam became so fierce that
the officers rushed Brown into the
ticket office and stood with their backs
against the door. Manager Morley
asked the crowd to disperse, but it was
ten minutes before the police ventured
out with the umpire. Finally he was
surrounded by officers and escorted to

W. T. Snyder, formerly of Sacra
mento, was found in a room at 19
Eddy street yesterday forenoon suf
fering from gas asphyxiation. He was
removed to the Emergency Hospital,
where Dr. Pawlicki administered Dr.
Hill's late remedy, peroxide of hydro
gen, but in this case the modern rem
edy failed to act as it had when Dr.
Hill applied It on a recent occasion.
The condition of Snyder is precarious
and his chances of recovery are re
mote. It is thought by some of his
friends that the man had contem
plated taking his life, as he showed
symptoms of melancholy, brought on
by trouble.
Poisoned With Gas.
Four favorites were knocked off the
perch at Oakland yesterday, but there
were other falls besides the header
taken by the talent.
Lady Rowell and Wandering Boy,
two starters in the opening event,
mixed it with the dust, but both Bell
and little Moran. their respective rid
ers, escaped injury. In the last race on
the programme Ocyrohe, the favorite,
â¢went down with 1 itzpatrick about a
furlong from the stand. The Coffey
stable jockey narrowly escaped serious
injury. As it was, the unlucky rider
got off with a wrenchf-d back and a
flight scalp wound. The fields wore an
open look, and it was one of the best
betting sessions of the meeting.
FLANFAR A GOOD REPEATER.
Flaneur, which won a purse on the
preceding day, proved a good repeater
by coming right back and taking the
opening event at odds of 9 to 10. It
was a fortunate win unquestionably,
for Karabel went the longest route and
then only lost the decision by a head.
Myrtle H, a 30 to 1 shot, ran third.
J. C. Nealon's Entre Nous showed to
be pounds the best of the ten starters
in the scramble for maiden two-year
old fillies. Helgesen. who had the mount,
left the barrier pulling up through be
ing cut off, and then the young miss
skirted her field and downed the 60 to
1 shot, Lily Golding, half a length. Ma
cene, another outsider, nosed out Glen
dene for show honors. The winner
ruled a warm favorite.
Neither Bob Itagon, the favorite, nor
George P. McNear, the second choice,
cut much of a figure in the Futurity
course selling run for two-year-olds.
"Big Bill" Knapp got away in the lead
with Yada, a 12 to 1 chance, tiptoeing
the bunch from start to finish. Corn
Blossom, a 7 to 1 outsider, with W. Da
vis in the saddle, dropped in three
lengths before the first choice, which
was piloted by Mickey McLaughlin.
EVEA G A WIXXER.
Resorting to figures it was difficult
to separate Evea G and. Heather
Honey, still the lafter mare had a pro
nounced call in the betting. Fitzpat
rick got Evea G away in front and,
stalling off the challenge of Frank Sul
livan astride the favorite, at the .end
finished first by three-fourths of a
lengrth in l:48Vi- Helgesen landed Allo
path in third pJace.
Vic Gilbert more than won Whoa Bill
out by the colt's clever run of the six
furlong sprint. T-he odds about the son
of Yrr El Rey went from 2% to 4%; In
a hard drive "Big Bill" Knapp placed
him over the plate a neck before the
post favorite. Sterling Towers. Doublet
lost the show to Scotsman by a neck.
If Ocyrohe, favorite for the conclud
ing mile selling affair, bad a chance it
was ruined by the celt falling about a
furlong from thÂ» stand. The winner
turned up in Bob Smith's Mindano,
backed from 6 to 4. which easily defeat
ed the pacemaker. Red Cross Nurse.
North West ran an indifferent third.

Britt, but has not yet succeeded in
getting the latter to make 130 pounds

meet Britt under any other conditions,
while Britt avers that there is nothing
doing with him except at 132 pounds
or over. If Coffroth can persuade
Britt to do 130 pounds the match i9

The spectators who Journeyed to
Battling Nelson's training camp at
Larkspur yesterday were treated to a
regular boxing carnival. The main
event was a' grudge fight between
Young Corbett, the boxer, is not wor
rying over the weight question. So
confident is he that he will reach the
mark by Sunday that he. spent yester
day afternoon with a party of friends
and his trainers at Sutro Baths swim
ming. No gymnasium work was done
in the afternoon, though in the morn- i
ing he did the hardest day's road work !
since he started training. With Billy
Otts he left his training quarters at 10
o'clock in the morning and they did
not return until 1 o'clock. More than
fifteen miles were covered.
Trainer Tuthill says Corbett weighed
136 pounds before he *-er.t on the road.
He is certain his charge was reduced
two pounds when he returned, as the
perspiration was rolling oft! him.
From the appearance of the Denver
ite he should reach the weight without
using any unusual exertions the last
day of training. His trainer says he
has mapped out a course of work for
the Denver lad that will bring him to
weight on Sunday evening. The fol
lowing two days will be devoted to
light exercise to keep his muscles in
trim. Tuthill says there will be no
chasing in. from the Cliff House behind
an automobile on the night of the fight.
This afternoon 'Corbett will resume
boxing. He will have Jack Johnson,
Jim Hayward and Billy Otts as spar
ring partners. Each day from now un
til Sunday considerable time will be
??ent on the road and in the gymna
sium.
Nelson was on the ro. 1 for fourteen
miles in the morning. After being
rubbed down he took his gun and went

1 The Oakland team is suffering from
a return attack of that ancient com
plaint that made tramps but of them
in the early part of the season, name
ly, yellow- streak. With the pennant
still in view the Commuters laid down
yesterday at Recreation Park to the
Seals. They quit before they were
half beaten. Score â San Francisco, 7;
Oakland, 3.
There was no reason why they did
not give the Seals a run,' even if it was
their fortune to get a beating. This
they refused to do, barring one inning,
when they ch.ased two runs in and
even then quit with two still on the
sacks and one out. To be sure they
did suffer from a little hard luck, but
this calamity might have been over
come by some rattling baseball which
the team is capable, of playing.
It was no fault of Moskiman's that
the Commuters lost, for he pitched
good enough' ball to win nine out of
ten games. "Brick" Devereaux started
the run getting with a glaring error
and after that time the team was not
itself. Byrnes executed a couple of
wide tosses, but the men in the field
refused to go after the thrown balls
and they both 'let in runs.
San Francisco started right away in
the second inning after two had been
chased. Anderson bit off a Texas
Leaguer between Francks and t)un
lcavy. Gochnauer was passed and
Wilson's drive filled the sacks. Barber
clouted an easy bounder to Devereaux,
who booted the ball around and then
hung his head. Van Buren's swing to
center brought in one more tally.
Oakland came back with one in the
next round on Byrnes' single, a sacri
fice by Stark and Francks' long fly.
The Seals celebrated the third period
with another pair, this time on errors
and bad plays by the Oakland infield.
Stark sent in two for Oakland during
the fifth with a timely three-bagger
out to the flagpole. After that Oak
land never raised her head and the
Seals managed to entice three more
through.
Ganley was out of the game and
Stark took his place in the right gar
den. ..Byrnes hurt his hand in the
eighth and Stark came in behind^the
bat. There will be two games to
day â the first at Oakland at 10 o'clock
and the second at the Eighth-street lot
at 2:30 o'clock. If Oakland expects to
figure as a champion team it will have
to take the next six games from the
Seals and the chances for that look
gloomy indeed. The score:
Oakland â San Francisco â

APVERTISEMEXTS.
Altoona, Pa., June 20, 1903.
I was afflicted with Tetter in bad shape.
It would appear in blotches as large as mr
hand, a yellowish color, and scale off.
You can imagine how offensive it was.
For twelve years I was afflicted with this
trouble. At night it was a case of scratch
and many times no rest at all. Seeing the
good the medicine was doing a fnend
who was taking it for Eczema, I com-
menced it, and as a result the eruption be-
gan to dry up and disappear, and to-day
I am practically a well man. Only two
tiny spots are left on the elbow and shin,
where once the whole body was affected.
I have every confidence in the medicine,
and feel sure that in a short time these
two remaining spots will disappear.
S. S.S. is certainly a great blood puri-
fier, and has done me a world of good.
I am grateful for what it has accom-
plished, and trusi*That what I have said
will lead others who are similarly afflict-
ed to take the remedy and obtain the
same good results that I have. â¢
125 East Fifth Ave. John F. Leak.
While washes, soaps, salves and powders
relieve temporarilv, they do not reach the
real cause of the disease. The blood must
be purified before the cure is permanent.

Before the end of this week four big
liners will be dispatched from the Pa
. cific Mail Company's wharves, rnaklnj:
a 'total of seven important sailings of
vessels flying the Harnraan flag within
as many days. The Manchuria and
City of Panama, each leaded deep with
merchandise and crowded with passen
gers, sailed !ast Saturday, the first for
the Far East and the secor.d for the
isthmus from which she take? her
nane. " The" company's big freighter
Aztec, with 7500 tor.s of freight, will
sail for the Orient to-morrow. The
Coptic will get away for the Far East
on Saturday, the day set for the de
parture of the Peru for Panama, and
th* Baiarouta on coasting cruise.
The Coptic will take about 4000 tons
of cargo, the Baraoouta 1500 terns, the
Peru 25C-Q.
The labor cf loading this fleet of
ocean carriers, following Immediately
upon the heroic exertions necessary to
get the Manchuria away on time, has
taxed the working force at the Mail
<ioek to the utmost. The chief burden
of the effort, however, is not falling
upon the Pacific Mail Company, but on
the owners of the horses, wagons and
drays that have been putting in tnelve
hours of waiting to one hour of work
ing. All the wharves are crowded with
freight and more is being unloaded
from trucks and drayw than is b^ing
hoisted into the holds of the waiting
steamers. Tfce more trucks headed for
the dock the slower the progress and
th* teamster, under present conditions,
that can make more than one trip a !
day Â»o either big or little Mai! dock is
a wonder. It would have puzzled a
burglar yesterday to break intn the |
Mail duck with a truck and all day
long groups of idle teamsters lounged
in the vicinity of the wharf, attesting
by their Inactivity to the waste of val
uable time Involved in tryirijr to handle
ten tons of frffsht in a space barely
J.irsr* enourh to accommodate a on.
It "will be at least a year before the
new wharves, vfclch will be equipped
v. ith zr.r-derzi appliarices for handling
freight, will be ready.
LOSS TO DRAYMEN
Eight additional arrests were made
by State Supreme Court officers to-day
on charges of contempt in violating the
injunction of the court on election day.
DENVER. Nov. 23.â The Supreme
Cour.t to-day ordered the Denver Elec
tion Commissioners not to certify to the
returns of this county to the State Can
vaSsins Board until further orders. This
is to give opportunity for argument in
the Supreme Court on the matter of
throwing out certain Democratic pre
cincts. In which the Republicans al
leged fraud.
Chairman Frederick A. Williams of
the Republican City Committee secured
from the County Court to-day a writ of
mandamus instructing the Election
Commission to permit him to make a
copy of the poll 'books for the purpose
of a contest of the county ticket.
In the second around not a solid blow
was struck. Both men swung wildly
at each other, the blows in most cases
falling short of the mark. What few
light blows were struck were harmless.
Root, as a rule, was the aggressor. All
through the second round the cro f wd
hissed and kept it up after the round
ended.
The third round was so palpably
The men did nothing more than
teint for nearly a full minute in the
opening round, which was followed by
a light exchange of blows, which left
no mark on the fighters. Ryan caught
Root lightly on the cheek and Root
returned with a light blow on the Jaw.
There was more sparring and then
Ryan let go a straight-arm blow to
Root's mouth, which did no damage.
When th&^.bell rang the men were
clinched. The spectators began to hiS3
the men toward the end of the round
and as they took their corners a storm
of disapproval was -hurled at them.
The managers of both fighters vehe
mently protested against the action of
the- referee, but -they found few sym
pathizers in the crowd.
Ryan and Root were late in entering
the ring. After the spectators had
been kept waiting half an hour
Referee McGuigan, who has an inter
est in the club, announced that the
fighters were counting the money in
the box office. He explained that the
house was a slim one and that each
man wanted his money in advance.
Five minutes later Ryan and Root ap
peared.
FEW BLOWS ARE STRUCK.
PHILADELPHIA. Nov. 23.â The
fight between Tommy Ryan, the mid
dle-weight pugilist, and Jack Root of
Chicago, the light heavy-weight,
which was scheduled to go six rounds
at the National Athletic Club to-night,
was ended in the middle of the fourth
rcund by the referee. Jack McGuigan,
announcing it was a fake. It was one
of. the most unsatisfactory p'ugilistic
affairs ever held in this city. The spec
tators, long before the referee stopped
the bout, showed their disapproval of
the exhibition the men were giving.
Trouble was averted by the prompt
work of the police in Jumping into the
ring and protecting the fighters and in
clearing the hall.
The fighters and their managers deÂ«
clared that the action of the referee
was an outrage and that It was unfair
to the patrbn3 to have stopped the fljht.
as both men were trying hard. Referee
McGuigan said it was the worst show
ing ever attempted in the city, and felt
sure the Ep**ctator* agreed with him.
He said the men were guaranteed $2300.
which they insisted upon getting before
entering the ring. As they had the
money he could do nothing but atop
the exhibition. He declared that the
club lost $1SCO on the venture.
The moment McGuigan left the men
a half hundred policemen, under the
command of a captain, surrounded the
ring. Ryan and Root stood in their re
spective corners, not knowing what to
do, and evidently afraid to leave th<?
arena for fear of harm at the hands of
the disappointed crowd. Suddenly a
soda water bottle which had been
thrown from the gallery dropped In the
middle of the ring. Then a score of po
licemen climbed through the ropes and
waved their hands for the crowd to
calm down. When the police had a
semblance of control Ryan and Root
were led to their dressing-rooms under
heavy escort.
The confusion was great. At the ex
piration of the three minutes the bell
rang. but. instead of sitting in their
corners, the men thought It was the be
ginning of the fourth round. The ref
eree let them go. He watched the men
mix up a little and then walked over to
where the newspaper men were seated
and told them Root had Just told Ryan
"to mix It up." He watched them
again attempting to land blows, which
they did without damage, and after 1
minute and 33 seconds had elapsed he
jumped through the ropes and left the
men in the ring alone. His action met
with, the approval of the crowd.
pcor that Referee McGuigan leaned
against the ropes and waved his hands
In dlsgrast at the fighters' attempt to
mix it up. After two minutes and
twenty seconds of the round had
elapsed Root swung: on Ryan and
Ryan dropped to the floor to avoid the
blow. At this action the referee
turned his back on the men and the
spectators became noisy. Ryan got on
one knee, and. seeing that the referee
was not tolling off the seconds, the
fighters went to their corners.

"SAMPLES ONLY" â The following are but
a few sample cases out of the MULTITUDE
successfully treated last week:
"CRIPPLE LEAPS"â Inflammatory rheuma-
tism stiffened my spine arid . limbs, could
barely CREEP along; last Tuesday Rexradio
straightened me out and limbered me up;
raised limbs naturally. RAN and LEAPED.
Many similar cases.
"LIFE SAVED" â "At the 'crisis' of danger-
ous disease he saved my life."
"DEATH AVERTED"â "Rexradio speedily,
-thoroughly cured me of dreadful malady,
which slowly but surely leads to certain
death." *
1 "SCIATICA'S DEMON FANGS exquisitely .
'tortured me; Rexradlo's power speedily slew j
thig GILA MONSTER and I entered a
PAINLESS PARADISE."
"IT STAYS"â "Rexradio cured my GASTRI-
TIS in July; I stay cured.".
"THE FIERY FURNACE of Typhoid Fever
was consuming me; Rexradio quickly quench-
ed It and delivered me."
"COULDN'T STOOP through Lumbago; quick-
ly, painlessly stooped and touched floor with
hands last week." (Numerous others^)
"NO RETUIÂ»N TICKET"â "My cancer left
many weeks ago and having no return ticket
It remains away." -'
"PILLORIED FOR YEARS" by deforming
"articular" rheumatism. Joints solid and
"Immovable." helpless, entirely waited on
â¢ by others, lifted from and Into bed. racked
with severest pains all" over, groaning with
agony If even lightly touched, lying In bed
like a statue cf marble, Mrs. Knowles, 370
Bartlett, by Rexradio's ONE treatment was
instantly able to freely, naturally, move.
each loosened Joint, fose unaided from bed,
and seated herself In a chair; first time In
years; her excruciating pains ceased and be-
ing at her request vigorously slapped she
declared the blows produced no pain; her
cheery welcome awaits "visitors"; she will
grasp and shake your hand with the hands
so long solid and unable to close. SEE
HER.
"FIRMLY ' LOCKED JOINTS." due to AN-
CHYLOSIS. In several ' cases recently, have
been UNLOCKED awi eet at liberty by the
MASTER KEY of Rexradlo's "humanized
Radium." (Proofs.)
DISLOCATED VERTE BRA.' 'âOne of the
spine bones thrown out of place, protruded
outwardly, producing PARALYSIS; Rex-
radio's wonderful power replaced It. also re-
moved the paralysis so I could run and
LEAP; see me." A precisely similar case
had a like benefit a week since.
"1^ ITS TOILS" â Acutely painful RHEUM-
ATIbM had me In its tolls; couldn't stoop,
raise feet, scarcely walk; Rexradio touched
me twice and, stooping, I touched the floor
with my hands, raised feet high, RAN and
LEAPED* freely,, painlessly; pains all gone
and smart clapping did not hurt, where the
. l<?ast touch â¢ hail produced agony before."
"MJTSIC IN' -HI9-... HEAD"â Totally deaf, pa-
tlent complained of hissing, crackling. roar-
Ing and MUSICAL sounds in his head; after
(onÂ») treatment he heard a' WHISPER and
said "AH those noises have ceased and even
'my MUSICAL BOX has RUN DOWN." -
"FAR REACHING" treatmentâ Numerous pa-
tients have been successfully treated for
various diseases, hundreds of miles away
without seeing Rexradio.
"SEVERAL PHYSICIANS" testify they SAW
Rexradio treat alleged "incurable" diseases
with amazing success. (Names at offices.)
"LIKE MAGICâ I saw the large CANCER
before R.'s (single) treatment; after, it was
lost to sight and touch. It was like magic.
"DANGER POINT" â Rexradlo's (one) treat-
ment at once removed my bedridden friend's
agonies when her acute disease had reached
the "alarming" danger point; next day she
rose WELL.
"PERMANENT RESULTS"â One treatment
may and often does secure surprising re-
sults, the possible permanence of which de-
pends on a limited number of further dally
treatments.
"PUBLICITY" is objected to by the above pa-
tlentB. .hence their "names" are not here

"Less than half a century ago the
heaviest gun known was the 68
pounder. This gun was about nine
inches bore, and fired a 68-pound pro
jectile, with a 16-pound charge of gun
powder, but was powerless against
four and a half inches of wrought
iron. Our battleships to-day are
equipped with 12-lnch guns, which,
with a charge of 400 to 425pounds
of' smokeless powder, are cap'able of
driving an 850-pound projectile
through fifty-one Inches of solid
wrought iron. In olden times It re
quired nearly four minutes to load and
fire one of the now obsolete 68-pound
ers, while the new- terrible 12-inch
guns can be loaded and fired in about
fifty seconds with perfect safety.
â¢ "If a projectile from one of the old
68-pounders hit its mark it was due to
good luck rather than to good man
agement, but it is a matter of proud
record that our modern 12-inch guns
have scored seven hits in less than
six minutes at target practice, while
our 6-inch gun has a record of nine
shots and nine hits in one minute."
The statistics of a modern 12-Inch
breech-loading rifle, as turned out by
the naval gun factory, makes an inter
esting showing. Its weight is 101,300
pounds, or over 45 tons. Its total
length, 36 feet 8 inches. The greatest
diameter of gun body is 45 inches; total
length of bore, 419.20 inches; capacity
of chamber, 12,043 cubic inches; total
capacity of bore," 51,355 cubic inches;
travel of projectile, 346.06 inches;
weight of charge, service velocity, 425
pounds; weight of projectile, 850
pounds; ratio of projectile pressure, 15
tons; muzzle velocity (service). 2100 feet
per second; thickness of steel which
shell will perforate at muzzle, 24.16
inches;, at 1500 Â« yards, 20.94 inches.â
Washington Star.
'.'This general development is not due
alone to improvements in guns or pow
der, or projectiles, but to the simulta
neous and progressive development of
all three.
Speaking of the development in the
defensive powers of the modern guns of
the American navy, as illustrated at
the Washington naval gun factory, an
experienced machinist and advance
worker said to a Star reporter:
POWER OF MODERN* GUNS.
Great credit for the handling of these
vast supplies of war materials and for
the complex recording of all receipts
and expenditures in the large establish
ment is due Major Jesse B. K. Lee,
chief clerk to the superintendent of the
naval gun factory and his force of as
sistants. ~-
The necessity of the proposed im
provements can be in a measure illus
trated by a summary of the great work
accomplished, in the past fiscal year
and that under way at the naval gun
factory. The expenditures for the year
for ordnance work and â¢ materials
amounted to $5,353,120. The value of
finished work sent out from 4.he factory
during the last year was 56,335,106. The
reason given for the excess Â«of value
shown in "finished work sent out" over
that of expenditures for the year is that
a lot of the work finished was com
menced in the preceding year and in
some cases the year before, but goes
into the accounts with this year's pro
duct. The value of .unfinished work in
hand at the beginning of the present
fiscal year was 56,600,000.
It Is an axiom that money, material
and labor are more carefully expended
under strict supervision at the naval
gun factory than in almost any other
department of the Government. Every
ounce of metal and every minute of la
bor expended is requi: to be accu
rately accounted fc-r, it is said.
During the past year shipments' of
ordnance material (guns, etc.), were
made to 117 United States naval ves
sels in commission, the total weight of
the articles shipped being 6,356.000
pounds, and to the proving ground at
Indian Head 33.566.000, or a total of 39,
922,000 pounds of ordnance material
sent out of the gun factory.
WORK ACCOMPLISHED.
IX. is the purpose of tne naval au
thorities to make Improvements at the
-Washington navy yard commensurate
with its importance as one of the best
big gun factories in the world, pro
vided Congress will be reasonably and
fairly liberal in the matter of appro
priation at its next and succeeding ses
sions.
In addition to the one-million-dollar
improvements now under way, as ex
clusively described in the Star several
days ago. Improvements have been rec
ommended for next year amounting
approximately to three million dollars.
The necessity for the new buildings
and machinery at Uncle Sam's great
gun foundry at the navy yard has been
apparent for some thne in order that
the plant can keep pace with the de
mands of the rapidly growing and su
perb American navy.
The new. buildings which -the gun
foundry officers have recommended are
stated to be: A new sighting shop and
the necessary machinery; a new brass,
iron and steel foundry and the neces
sary appliances; a new gun shop for
the manufacture of medium and small
caliber guns, with new machinery; a
new locomotive house for the use of
the locomotives of the gun factory
railroad; a new forge shop; extension
of the east and west gun carriage shops
Ly erecting new shops on the site at
present occupied by the old foundry; a
new pattern shop; a fireproof pattern
storehouse; a muster house /or muster
ing the thousands of employes.
There was a pathetic scene at the
apartments of the couple at the Al
hambra to-day when Drake was taken
into custody by an officer from the
prison. His wife had previously an
nounced her intention of remaining
loyal to him and helping him to live
down the past, but she was prevailed
upon by her mother to return to her"
home in Cincinnati.
Drake, whose age is given as forty
three, was formerly a well-to-do citi
zen of Tiffin, Ohio, where he was the
agent - of a life insurance company.
Since he was released on parole he has
claimed to own valuable mining claims
ir. Mexico and represented himself to
bo secretary of the American and Mex
ican Mining Company of Ameca, Jalis
co, Mexico. 0
COLUMBUS. Ohio, Nov. 23.â A re
markable romance was abruptly ter
minated to-day when Russell B. Drake,
alias James Russell Lowell Miller, a
paroled convict, who has been living in
Columbus since his release, was re
turned to the Ohio penitentiary for vio
lating his parole. V
Drake In August last wedded Miss K.
Schoemer, an accomplished musician of
Cincinnati, under the name of Miller-
No intimation of the fact that her hus
band was a paroled convict reached the
wife until yesterday, when a statement
signed by Drake's son-in-law, Charles
K. Heidelberg of Bowling Green, Ohio,
ieveallng the fact, was published in
the newspapers. It was through this
statement also that the prison officials
learned that Drake had violated his
parole by assuming a new name and
marrying.

WHEAT â There/ was . not much change any
where yesterday, either here or abroad. Lo

much demand.
The Chicago wires of. E. â¢ F. Hutton & Co.
yesterday aaid: "Receipts at Northwest pri
mary markets show a large increase over last I
year, while Southwest markets show, a decided
falling- off Broomhall estimates surplus' re
maining in Argentine about 13.000.000 bushels.
Argentine weather conditions are somewhat
conflicting. A better demand is. reported a/
primary . markets for cash Wheat, and some
Flour business Is reported, but talks confirma
tion. One hundred- thousand No. 2 hard re
ported sold at this - market for Buffalo. To
our minds the uncertainty existing . over Â¦ the
Argentine situation will cause some nervous
ness In the trade, and until we get; some defi
nite news of conditions prevailing In that
country wo Mel that the market will likely
move within ' narrow limits. Any serious dam
ago to that crop- at this time would eet , all
the world's markets' aflame and. cause very
much higher prices. Aside from this wÂ«>fee!
it will take a very urgent demand for cash
Wheat and Flour . to maintain present high
prices for Wheat In this country."

For the day preceding Thanksgiving the
market for Butter and Eggs was a disappoint
ment yesterday. Butter continued weak and
dull, though prices remained stationary. Ranch
Egg's were neglected and accumulating and
the large handlers offered them freely In the
afternoon : at 40c, wiih few buyers. The ex
pectation was that there would be a still fur-'
ther decline after the holiday. The public
consumption has been educated up to the East
ern and cold-storage goods, which is tha main
reason why the demand for i fresh ranch Is so
light.

The market for dressed Turkeys was de
moralized, with conditions all In favor of buy
ers. Fresh receipts were approximated at S5
tons, and there was an abundance of carried
over atock on hand. At the opening the ruling
price for prime fancy stock was 22c, with
some little business 'reported at 23c, but as
buyers refused to take hold at those figures
prices soon broke to 20c and continued to de
cline until Â¦ 18c was the highest price asked
for round lots, and there was a general rush
to sell at that figure. A carload of choice
stock came In from Oregon, and rather than
sacrifice It the receivers decided to place, It
tn storage. Late in the day several dealers
were trying to effect clearances at the flat rate
of 15c. per pound, but were generally unable
to do so. It was generally conceded that the
break In the market was due to the Indiffer
ence of the public about buying Turkeys, as
under normal conditions the receipts of the
past three days would not be considered ex
cessive, and, as previously mentioned, the pre
dictions that prices would be as high as last
year caused many people to decide to do with
out Turkeys. Live Turkeys were weaker in
sympathy with dressed, while other ltve Poul
try was dull at nominal prices. .
S) Retailers paid but little attention to Gams
and there was a general decline In price3 of
Wild Ducks.

It is generally believed there is quite a short
interest in Hog products and the action of the

feel the January stuff can be bought on re

market Is steady, with some sales at the top

The Hay circular of Somers &' Co. says:
"Shipments of hay show a little Increase
during the past week over the record for the
week preceding, the total showing 2500 tons,
in comparison with 22UO. We have had a very
quiet market right along, although there .was
some evidence of better prices until Monday,
when the arrival of fully 1000 tons weakened
the situation again, so for the present we have
practically the same condition of affairs to
report as baa been noted for over a month
past.
"The rather peculiar weather and crop con
ditions have created some talk for several
weeks past, although at this early date we do
not think that 'any apprehension need be felt
as to next season's crop. Of course, if tha
present dry weather continues well into De
cember therÂ«, Is bound to be some little ex
citement, which, of course will affect the hay,
market very materially. We are Inclined to
believe, however, that owing to the plentiful
amount of hay in the country the market wilt
continue along without any very great change
from the present range of prices.
"Southern California is still drawing from
our country stocks, but export trade is vry
quiet and local consumption shows somewhat
lighter than is generally noted for this time of
the year. J
"Choice wheat hay continues to come in
quite freely and we still' find that the poorer
qualities are being held back. Prices show
practically no change from those quoted for
the last two or three weeks."

1 COVi- Â¦ For a time trading was very" .quiet
and prices held around the low point. Toward'
the middle of the session sentiment became
quite bullish, one of the causes of the. im
proved tone was a decrease in primary re
cciptg, arrivals to-day at Kansas City and St.
Louis being only about one-half those ot the
corresponding day a year ago. Another factot.
was the continuance of; drouth conditions in
the Southwest. The Kansas crop report noted
considerable damage through. that State. v ' Late
news from the Northwest also favored the
bulls, demand for' flour at Minneapolis being
somewhat Improved. On the rally December
advanced to {l'W'/i and May to $1 10^;^ All
of the gain however, was lost during the last
half hour, profit-taking being largely rcspon-.
sifcle for a break in December to $1 OS 1 };. May
declined to $1 09^<Â®l 09%. The market closed
easy, with December off ' }4@%c at $1 08%.

In corn the market was firm. December
closed at 499s c. a sain of %c.
December oats closed *&@Hic higher at 20%c.
Provisions were steady, " as a result of a
tmall run of hogs at the yards. Trading was
entirely local and of small volume. At the

unchanged and ribs were up a shade.

he hoped ..the brotherhood he belonged
to, the Brotherhood of Boiler Makers

From New York's subway to the mines
of the Sierras, the. hand of labor was
apparent, â¢ and nowhere more so than
in the magnificent fighting craft that
lay in the harbor. :
Frank Devjin followed with a few
words of welcome, to which President
Gompers afterward responded. He
said that if anything confounded the
opponents of organized "labor it " was
the appearance of great men of . the
country mingling with the- labor men
at the- feast. _ He 'told ' of .. President
Roosevelt's statement that if he were
a laboring man he would Join union
in his trade. He then spoke* of the
work of labor for universal peace and
said that a' nation needed a navy so

Patrolmen Berry and McCortie were
in Judgfe Cabanlss' court to tell how
they arrested Miss Alice Wilson for
masquerading in masculine attire, but
the defendant failed to appeaft- and
thereby conveyed vexation of spirit, to
an expectant "auditory. The Judge
hinted at forfeiting the /10 bail that
was presertf in lieu of the woman, but
an attorney asked for and obtained a
continuance till to-morrow.
Miss Wilsonâ which is not her
name â was promenading Fulton
street, near the Chutes, at midnight
Tuesday when "the policemen cap
tured her. She was accompanied by
two women atlired In automobiling
costume, while she wore masculine
nether garments that were consider
ably too small for her. She said she
had met with an accident while
autoing. It ruined her own clothing
and she was compelled to don her
little brother's trousers. to enable her
to reach her home.
"I might have expected that," said
the officer to the Judge, "but it was
to save the woman from a threaten
ing knockout that I grabbed the man
first. He had her going."
NelliÂ« sniffed derisively and de
clared there was not the least danger
of her being knocked out. "I don't
care what any one says," _ she ex
claimed, "John never touched me, and
this policeman had no right to butt in,
anyway." \ Â¦
The Asperns, John and Nellie, will
be sentenced to-morrow for disturb
ing the peace.
Since their j wedding, less than C
twelvemonth ago, John and Nellie
Aspern have not dwelt in unbroken
marital felicity. Contention entered
their, home ''at Fifth and Brannan
streets ere the honeymoon had fairly
waned, and from acrimonious argu
ment it gradually broadened Into fistic
combat. In the oral tilts Nellie in
variably held her own and' had some
to spare, but in the athletic contests
John's superior muscle and knowledge
of the boxing game always won oufe
If conquered, however, Nellie was
never subdued. Her defeats were not
accompanied by disgrace, as that ele
ment is rated in pugdom. for in ab
sorption of punishment she proved
herself a perfect glutton. Before
she succumbed John was convinced
that he had a fight onhand.
In the battle described by. Patrol
man P. Hammond to . Police Judge
Mogan the woman had been knocked
down three times within as many
minutes, but was upon her feet and
punching hard. If not scientifically,
when the bout was stopped by the
officer's arrival. â¢ He. gallantly grasped
John ' and purposely afforded . Nellie
opportunity :to deliver a "sockdolo
ger" or two upon the prisoner's coun
tenance, but instead of doing that she
transferred her battery to, the police
man.
Again was the case of W. A. Prole,
charged with assaulting fourteen-year
old Lorella Campbell,' called In Judge
Mogan's court, again was there no
appearance of either the girl or her
mother. A detective who had previous
ly been detailed to discover their
whereabouts reported that they have
left the State. Another continuance of
two days was then ordered.
* John Wilson, a boy, was accused of
stealing twelve pounds of twine from
W. A. Plummer's rope and cordage
store. 111 Clay street, and' among the
puns evolved by the hearing 1 was one to
the effect that the defendant was
"roped in," and another alleging that
the arresting, policeman. had the pris
oner "on a string." When the Judge
pronounced the defendant guilty and
senten/ed him to three months* Impris
onment the attorney for the prosecu
tion opined that the decision was in ac

Laura Traver, alias Laura Le Seer,
was sent by Judge Fritz to the Supe
rior Court, where a jury will determine
her guilt or innocence of the charge of
felony embezzlement. Her bond was
fixed at $1000.
Miss Martini Turner said it was in
Samaritan spirit purely that she spoke
to a plain-clothes policeman night be
fore last at Post and Stockton streets.
She saw him stub his toe against a
sidewalk protubTrance, she explained,
and ! being a prof esrional chiropodist
and all-round expert In the treatment
of ailments of the feet, she asked him
If he was much hurt and if she could
do anything to alleviate his suffering.
To her great surprise he arrested her,
and there she was. The policeman's
version of his chat with the defendant
was somewhat conflicting with hers,
and Judge Mogan continued the case to
afford Miss Turner time and opportu
nity to prove her claim to the consider
ation due a licensed corn doctor.

saulted Ulln. Meeks, so the detectives
allege, was seen leaving the schooner
Ensign with Ulln and accompanied
him uptown.
A confirmation of the stories afloat
yesterday could not be obtained from
I. W. Hellman last night, but a man
who is very close to the banker and
railroad magnate said that it was true
that several changes had been made in
the directorate of the two Los Angeles
street railway corporations, but he did
not regard it as very significant. Con
tihuing'he said: . -
"Although several directors have been
changed, it' remains a fact that Henry
E. Huntlngton 4s still president of the
pacific Electric Railway. As a matter
of fact, Huntington has always been a
minority stockholder, but with the aid
of Hellman lie has practically dom
inated in the affairs of the companies.
Furthermore, "Hellman, as every one
knows, has . long been interested with
Harriman, and to-day the banker and
his son are representatives of the Har
riman interests, in a number of the
steam railroads in California."
A representative of The Call tried to
get a statement from H. E. Huntington
in Los Angeles, but. he refused to talk
and Immediately closed the mouths of
his subordinates. '
Last night this story was followed by
another from Los Angeles to the effect
that Huntington has signified his Inten
tion of getting out of the directorate of
the Southern Pacific Company, an an
nouncement that' may \ xnWan* a bitter
flght between the three moneyed men.
It is only a few months ago that peace
was patched â¢ up between Huntington
and Harriman after, their- war in Los
Angeles rights of way for street
railway companies. It was generally
understood that I. W.. Hellman was' the
peacemaker, and this fact naturally
deepens the Interest of the financial
world In the latest report that Hellman
and Huhtlngton" are, differing In their
business matters.
The local financial world was startled
yesterday by a report that I. W.,Hell
man and H.'^E.Huntington have disa
greed over the -policy of the \ Pacific
Electric Railway . and the Interurban
Railway companies of Los Angeles, in
which they . are jointly interested with
E. H: Harriman, and that as a result
Banker Hellman has joined with Harri
man In placing. Huntington in' the mi
nority, in the control of /tlfose compa
nies. It was reported that at the recent
election of .directors in the companies
named Hellman threw his stock to
Harriman and thereby aided the latter
in selecting: several new directors that
are not supposed to be in harmonywith
the interests of Huntington. .' . " Â¦' . :
