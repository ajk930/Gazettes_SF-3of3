LOS ANGELES. Feb. 3.â Southern
California is to-night more thoroughly
â¢oaked with moisture than it has been
for several years and there is more
*ater in the river courses than has
been seen for eighteen years, accord-
Ing to the statements of old residents.
To-night, at frequent intervals, there
â ire heavy shower?, with flashes of
lightning, an unusual feature of rain
storms in thie section.
While the Government Weather Bu
reau reports about an inch and a half
of rfcin within the last twenty-four
hours, the precipitation' in many places
has been double and possibly , three
times that amount. No great damage
has yet been reported except to < street
"work under way and to excavations for
new buildings. Telephone communica
tion with outside towns shows consid
erable disarrangement and there is
some damage to the roadbeds of the
interurban electric lines. On the sum
mit of Mount Lowe last night there
was a deluge of water, . somewhat in
the nature : of a .. cloudburst, . and the
flood rushed down. against the Alpine
Tavern, carrying away part of the
kitchen.
At- Burbank the water washed out
a small section of- the Southern Pacific
tracks this morning, causing, some de
lay to traffic. .It was soon repaired;,
however,' and trains "assumed running.
At Pasadena this afternoon there I was
the heaviest ,: downpour known ,- there

INVITATION
DECLINED
Cannon Refuses to
Attend a State
Dinner.
Speaker Objects Because He
Was Not to Be Given
Precedence.
Sends a Note and Remains Away
From Aflair in Honor of the
Supreme Court.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3. â To "Uncle
Joe" Cannon, Speaker of the House,
belongs the distinction of being the
first man who has declined to dine in
the White House since Rosoevelt be
came President, and all social and of
ficial Washington stood still in aston
ishment to-day when it heard the
ne ws.
Cannon Was invited to the state din
ner given last night to the members of
the Supreme Court. It was decreed
that as this dinner was to the mem
bc-rs of the Supreme Court, the Jus
tices should take precedence. The
Chief Justice is in mourning for his
v.ife and could not attend, so the place
of honor at the dinner fell to Justice
Harlan.
When Speaker Cannon learned that
the court was to be accorded preced
ence over him he sat down and penned
a note to the President, in which he
arserted that, as Speaker of the House,
he could not be outranked by any per
son at that dinner, except the Presi
dent, and he begged the President to
excuse him. This the President did
and will doubtless have Speaker Can
non to a dinner where he will be able
to accord him the position which his
rank commands. It is explained that
it the Presidents-had not given the Su
preme C*urt of fhe United Si
eedence at the dinner given especially
to its members the dignified Judges
would have felt deeply affronted.
Washington is wondering what the
plain folks of Danville, 111., will say
when they hear what their democratic
idol has been doing.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 3.â Not only
has the State Department amended the
protocol signed in Santo Domingo on
January 20 providing for an American
fiscal protectorate over the turbulent
republic, but it has disapproved the en
tire instrument. A new agreement, un
der which the United States will ad
minister the affairs of the black repub
lic, is being framed. It is yet to be
signed, and as the Senate is to ratify it
it is now being drawn with great care
at San Domingo City under daily in
structions from the department to Daw.
son, the Minister. He is ex
pected to sign it within a few days.
An effort was made to-day to ascer
tain whether, if the Senate fails to act
upon the treaty before March 4, the
President will assume charge of Santo
Domingo's affairs. The State Depart
ment avoids any statement on this
point, but it can be stated that the
President believes the executive Jias the
power to pursue such a course.
â¢ Whether the I Senate adjourns without
action or not, a dangerous state of
things will 'continue in \ Santo Domingo.
The republic's blindness to its just ob

FORCE FOR VENEZUELA.
AVarships May Be Necessary to Bring
Castro to Terms.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 3. â "Do you
think a warship would have a good ef
ftct on President Castro?" a State De
partment official was asked to-day.
"I think three warships would," was
the reply.
This explains as clearly as anything
can the situation in which the rela
tions of the United States and Vene
zuela are to-day. The crisis is draw
ing near. There is one ray of encour
agement in the idea prevailing here,
that the only way to protect American
rights in Venezuela is by force, and
considerable force at that. The slight
encouragement referred to is the re
cent report to the State Department
that the Venezuelan Government may
reconsider its' refusal to accept arbi
tration. President Castro is still ab
sent from Caracas, apparently mak
ing merry in some of "the small cities.
Minister Bowen is not on good terms
vith Castro and has not been since he
ofi ended the late Minister of Foreign
Affairs by sending out that official on
a matter of diplomatic import while
ho was giving a party. Bowen. in or
der to preserve the good relation*, was
compelled to write a letter of apology
to the Foreign Minister and also had a
notable correspondence with Presi
dent Castro, who took up the Foreign
Minister's side, apparently more to em
barrass Bowen that from any love for
the Foreign Minister, whom he later
ousted from the Ministry.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Feb. 3. â Peter
Eberhart is supposed to be the name
of a farmhand who yesterday drank
a small bottle of nitro-glycerin on a
v.ager, froze to death while walking
home and to-day exploded when ef
forts were made to thaw him out.
Peter worked for Claude Argonvale
near Wheatley, Minn., and while in
the village yesterday got drunk with
the Town Marshal, who showed him a
bottle of nitro-glycerin. saying it was
taken from a bank robber. Peter bet
that he could drink the contents and
never f?el the injurious effects. He
drank tho nitro-glycerin and started
for home. Whether from the explosive,
whisky or intense cold, he failed to 'get
home, and this morning was found by
the roadside frozen to death. The body,
which was badly distorted, was picked
up and hauled to the Argonvale home,
where Peter's late boss undertook to
thaw him out so that the body might
be placed in a coffin and properly com
posed. While the body was left in
an outbuilding near a stove, in which
was a roaring fire, the nitro-glycerin
exploded. The building was complete
ly wrecked, and one button, a boot
heel and a piece of a watch chain were
all that was found of Peter.

NEW YORK. Feb. 3.â Mrs. Jefferson
Davis, widow of the president of the
Confederate States, is living in this
city at the Hotel Gerard. Mrs. Davis
has been confined to her apartments for
the past week and to-day when a re
porter called on her, she sent word by
her secretary that she was too ill to be
seen. Through the secretary Mrs. Da
vis was asked if she cared to make a
statement concerning General Miles'
utterances to the effect that he had
been compelled to shackle Davis after
his capture because the latter tried to
escape. Mrs. Davis replied that she
was unable to discuss the matter at
this time because her health would not
permit it.
It was learned at the Hotel Gerard
that Mrs. Davis has been in poor health
for some time. So feeble is she that all

Tarnma Jail Holds San Franciscan
Who Punched Traveler for Show

TACOMA, Feb. 3. â Walter W. Law
son of San Francisco and W. H. Wil

jail as the result of a quarrel last
night in the women's parlor of the
Tacoma Hotel over the attentions paid
by Wilburn to Mrs. L/awson.
Lawson claims that his wife, whom
he married a year ago. left him sev

a scene at the* Hotel Northern, in
Seattle, where Mrs. Lawson and Wil

her. Last night at the Tacoma Hotel
Lawson struck Wilburn with his fists,

PREPARED

AT GERMANY
British Place Ships
In the North
Sea.
LONDON, Feb. 3.â A speech delivered
in the Hampshire village of Eastleigh
last evening by Arthur Hamilton
Lee, Civil Lord of the Admiralty, has
created much excitement. In dealing
with the recent redistribution of Great
Britain's naval forces. Lee frankly de
clared that Great. Britain had not so
much to keep her eyes on France and
the Mediterranean, but should look with
anxiety, though not with fear, toward
the North Sea. and the fleets had been
so distributed as to enable them to
deal with any danger in that direction
that may occur.
If war should unhappily be declared,
he continued, under existing conditions
the British navy would get its blow in
first, befon* the other side had time to
read in the papers that war haa been
declared. He maintained that "by re
cent naval reforms Great Britain's
strength as a naval fighting power has
been doubled during the last few
weeks."
The speech, which was delivered at
a railway dinner, in nowise of a politi
cal character, is commented on in some
i of the London morning papers as ex
ceedingly indiscreet and likely to be
greatly resented by Germany, at which
it evidently pointed. The Daily Chron
icle suggests that Premier Balfour
should muzzle his Civil Lord of the
Admiralty. â¢

Russian General Retires From Com
mand of Second Manchurian Army.
ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. 3.âLieu
tenant General Gripenberg has asked
to be relieved of command of the sec
ond Manchurian army and has hand
ed over his command to Lieutenant
General Myloff because of ill health.
It is believed in military circles that
the succession of Lieutenant General
Myloff to the command of the second
army of Manchuria does not neces
sarily mean that the position of sec
ond in command in the Far East has
devolved upon him. General Myloff
has a good record as a fighter, though
he was not present at any of the great
battles of the Manchurian campaign.
He is 62 years old. He fought in the
Turkish campaign and saw a great
deal of service in the Caucasus. He
w;i* appointed to the command of the
Eighth corps in 1301 and went \to
Mi huria with that corps fr#m
ud.'soa. The Eighth Corps was one
of the latest .corps to arrive there.
Army officers confirm the report
that General Gripenberg is in ill
health md point out that he was seri
ously ill a year before his appoint
ment to the command of the second
army of Manchuria.

ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. 4. â Offi

committee of Ministers on guarantees
for the observance of laws and for
the prevention of arbitrary conduct
by officials evoke general satisfaction.
The proposal to restore the Senate's
original character as the chief guaT

quarters as the cornerstone of the
new edifice which is building on the
ruins of the bureaucracy.
Special commissions of the

broadcast that I have ordered Gorky

a baseless fabrication, invented by per

impossible for a representative of the

course, reveal the exact ternjs of the
accusation against the prisoner, but
you may emphatically contradict the
version of the discovery of documents
implicating eight men who were to

Turning to the question of the pres
ent aspect of affairs, the Governor Gen

"We have every reason to feel satis
fied. Masters and men are now on ex

everywhere quietly. The reception of
the workmen's deputation by the Em
peror has created the best impression.
As to insinuations that the workmen
who were received at Tsarskoe-Selo
were not representative, you may say
their selection -was not influenced in
any way by the Government. The se
lection of the men had to be made
within a day. I summoned the princi
pal manufacturers and asked them -to
choose their most trustworthy and in
fluential men, and this was done."

SALEM Or., Feb. 3. â A plot to de

day through the confession of one W.

he had been summoned, that he had

Applications to purchase school lands
near Klamath Falls were filed by nine

CALF ATTACKS,
AGED WOMAN
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MODESTO, Feb. 3.â Mrs. Ellen
GrayÂ«ton, aged 78 years, one of the
pioneer women of this section, is lying
at death's door at her home in this
city as the result of the attack of a
vicious calf this afternoon.
Mrs. Grayston left her home at 2:30
this afternoon to visit with a neighbor
across the street. Ab she crossea the
street she noticed a calf standing in
the re-ad. She paid no attention to the
animal, but as she reached the gafVof
her neighbor's lawn just at the out
s-kirts of the business seetioa of the
town she heard a bellow and- looked
around just in time to see the calf as
it struck- her head on. The eld lady
was hurled to the ground and then the
brute with a triumphant bleat began
to jump upon her with its forefeet and
butt her feiociously with its head. No
one was a witness of the attack, but
ths screams of the old lady brought
neighbors to their doors and with dif
ficulty they drove the animal from its
victim.
Both the old lady's lower jaw bones
were broken, her face cut and bruised,
her breast lacerated and her whole
body a mass of bruises. Her clothing
was torn to shreds.
Mre. Grayston was carried into the
house and medical aid summoned. The
physician at once pronounced her inju
ries fatal, there being serious internal
injuries besides the fractures and
bruifsee.
The calf is the property of a Spaniard
named Jesus Romeo, and the children
of the owner had taught the little brute
to butt.

ATTACK ON OKU FAILS.
Russian Attempt to Turn His Left
Flank Proves a Failure.
GENERAL OKU'S HEADQUAR
TERS, Jan. 30, noon, via Tientsin, Feb.
3 (delayed in transmission).â The Rus
sian attempt to turn General Oku's left
flank has proved a complete failure.
Following on the failure of the recent
cavalry raid down the railway, this, it
is thought by the Japanese, will prob
ably induoe the Russians to await in
the future the Japanese attack. The
attempt, even with the bombardment
of other portions of the line, or a cav
alry movement around the flank, was
doomed to failure from the start. The
Japanese were at Heikoutai. but with
drew their small force from there and
allowed the Russians to occupy the
position until they could move over
enough men to make its recapture cer
tain.
Th'j reoccupation of this position was
easily accomplished, although the loss
was heavy. The casualties have not
yet been reported, but it is believed
that they will amount to fully 3000.
The Russians had hve^divisions en
gaged at Heikoutai and in that di
rection. They were driven back by
loss than two Japanese divisions.
M*ire than 100.000 men were engaged
in the Russian demonstration against
the Japanese positions immediately
east of Heikoutaiâ a force strong
enough to have been successful, as only
about one Japanese division was sent
against them. The Russian loss is
estimated at 4000, although prisoners
say that one regiment was practically
annihilated. The Japanese loss is
placed at only 200, due to the fact that
they remained in their trenches, while
the Russians v.ere forced to cross open
ground, solidly frozen, where the con
struction ot shelter trenches was im
poaetbie. The ground being covered
with snow, was nalurally a great dis
advantase to the attacking force, as
it was plainly visible against the white
background for a long distance. The

American Squadron Sails From Luzon
for Southern Archipelago.
PARIS, Feb. 3.â An official dispatch
: from Manila says that an American
squadron composed of fifteen warships
sailed to-day from the island of Luzon
i for the southern waters of the archi
! pelago, with the object of maintain
j ing neutrality in American waters both
I as to Russian or Japanese fleets.
It is the understanding here that the
! movement of the American sauadion is
i a precautionary step taken in connec
j tion with the movements of the Rus
j sian second Pacific squadron and of
Japanese warships. A recent dispatch
I said that Japanese warships had been
1 seen in Southern Philippine waters, and
! it is therefore expected that the pre
: cautionary measures apply equally

is added here that the Dutch islands

The Dutch Government has already

LONGER HOURS
BUT NO WORK
Within the very shadow of the statue
of Lincoln holding forth to the enchain
ed slaves the emancipation proclama
tion, the stately United States Mint
building holds 300 human beings pin
ing for liberty they cannot get. It is
all because of Eastern jealousy of the
Western inclination to take the world
easy and not to lead the strenuous life.
The Treasury Department makes no
distinctions. A full eight hours must
constitute a day's work here as else
where, and herein lies the trouble.
For many years tne San "Francisco
Mint has been a privileged institution.
WbÂ«*n a certain assignment of work
in a. given department w%s completed
the men and women employed therein
could mark up their time and leave the
building. Sometimes the work of a de
partment would be completed as early
ffs 11 o'clock a. m. and a half-holiday
would fall to him or her who had deft
ly filed the last twenty or weighed the
final ounce.
The Eastern mint people heard of
the jolly Californians. and all want
ed to be transferred to the realm of
short hours. Other mints compel em
ployes to remain on duty, work or no
work, till 4 p. m. Their" employes
made complaint, it is said, and the
Treasury Department notified Super
intendent Leach to retain his noble 30)
for a \ o'clock charge on Fifth street.
This order was followed by another,
which ruled that employes nuist not
leave their respective departments un
til the whistle blows.
The employes say it is pretty hard
work looking out barred windows and
dreaming how long it takes a clock
hand to travel two hours when there's
nothing doing.
John Deegan of the machinists' de
partment is said to be planning to pass
the long, weary hours surveying the
free country ir. the immediate vicinity
from one of the towers. Harry Me-
Guerin. Edward Riley and George
Erown have established a wireless tel
egraph system between their several
dpp.-irtinents by which some idea of
how the life of confinement is wearing
on the imprisoned ones can be re
curded. Jack Kirby is manufacturing
for himself a gaspipe connection with
Dan Riordan's place on Eddy street.
Among those who are "in" -several
hours per day over their accustomed
time is ex-Sheriff Healy of Marin
County. He thinks it is pretty hard
on a. man who has locked up so many
people to have the key turned on him
in his declining years.
Yesterday afternoon the Mint whistle
blew promptly at 4 o'clock, and a big
crowd gathered on Fifth street to see
the employes come trooping out. First
came the women, then the men. Dave
Meeker of the silver department rush
ed across Market street murmuring
"Dan's! Gee, but I'm dry!" Dave,
who is an advocate of good roads, over
looked a chuckhole in Market street,
tripped and fell in and has not been
heard from since.
But Uncle Sam is a stern master,
and what he pays goes. The halcyon
days of short hours are over.

WILLFUL INFRACTIONS
Watson of Indiana Declares
Against Activity of Rural
Mail Carriers in 'Politics
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3.â "Flagrant,
willful and continuous violations)" of
the law during the last five years are
laid at the door of the Atchison, To
peka and Santa Fe Railroad in a de
cision rendered to-day by the Inter
state Commerce Commission on the
unlawful rates and practices"
of that road in the transportation of
coul and mine supplies. The decision
also involves the Colorado Fuel and
Iron Company. The main points of
the decision are as follows:
The act to regulate commerce requires car
riers to publish and adhere to their tariffs.
The Atohlson, Topeka and Santa Ke Railway
Company has for the last five year? willfully
and continuously violated this provision in the
law in the respects above stated.
February in. Hit):;, the so-called "Elklns
bill" was enacted, providing that carriers
should In no cafe transport traffic until a
I raffle achadale haft bfon published, and that
the published tariff should be observed, and
providing a penalty of not less than lIOUO n Mr
more than (20, W0 for each offense. The pro
visions of this statute extend both to the
railway company which grants and the party
which receives the concessions. Both the
.Santa Fe and tho Colorado Fuul and Iron
i ompany systematically and continuously vi>
lated the provisions of that act In the par
ticulars mentioned from the day of its pas
sage down to November 21. 11HI4. when the
tariffs under which this coal moved were re
chice.l in all cases fl 15. It would seem that
the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad was
in violation oi' the same statute during that
period, but that company was not a party to
this proceeding and has not been heard.
It should be further observed that on March
L.">. IMS, the Tnited States Circuit Court, in
a suit begun at the instance and request of
the Interstate Commerce Commission enjoined
th<- Atrhison, Topeka and Santa Ke' Hallway
Company to observe in all respects Up pub
lished schedules of rates. That company from
the date of this injunction down to Noyemtwr
-'7. 11)04, was apparently in continuous disre
gard of that ordfr of court In Its failure to
maintain those coal tariffs.
v The decision says that a number of
other operators in New Mexico besides
Bowie of the Caledonia Coal Company
! found it difficult \ to dispose of their
products in competition with the' Col
orado Fuel and Iron Company
'The Santa Fe Company, the commis
! sion I says, acted ;as agent for the Col-
I orado Fuel and Iron Company in col
lecting from its customers the price of
the; coal itself ; along with the , freight
rate, and evidence shewed that in one
â¢ instance.*, at least, this also was done
for the Victor ; Fuel Company. Under
this arrangement v; the Santa Fe in
structed its agents to bill coal from cer
tain points at | which the Colorado Fuel
and Iron Company operated to various
station? on its system at figures to be
furnished iby the Colorado Fuel ; and
Iron Company, and the practice seems,

MEDAL IS WON
BY SHERRIFFS
OF STANFORD
ALEXANDER SHERRIFFS OF SAN
JOSE. WHO WON THE CARNOT
MEDAL FOR DEBATERS.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Feb. 3.â
Alexander Sherriffs of Stanford Untver
i sity in the eleventh annual debate be
! tween Stanford University and the
j University of California for the posses
sion of the Carnot medal proved that
the question, "Resolved, that the policy
of the late Combes Ministry with re
, gard to the relation of church and state
i in France was wise." should be decided
j in the affirmative, and won the coveted
j mÂ»dal, as well as proving himself the
j best debater of the two universities.
The decision of the judges was unan
! imous. and hardly was it announced by
j Professor Lisser when the Stanford
students picked up the winning debater j
and carried him in triumph around the
great assembly hall.
The Carnot medal, presented by the '
Baron de Coubertin for the purpose of
encouraging the study and discussion
in California of French history and I
politics, is awarded annually to the
student who proves himself the best de
bater in a contest held for the purpose
between Stanford University arid the
University of California.
Under the rules of 1905. the general '
subject for the debate was announced
in November, but the particular ques
tion, embodied in a resolution, was an
nounced to the debaters only two hours
before the time for speaking. This
general subject was 'The Relations of
Church ai?d State in France Since 1801." .
This medal has now been won four
times by Stanford and seven times by
California. Sherriffs was gfven the
prise not only for logical thinking, but
for exceedingly clever presentation. His
speech, which wa? nearly extempora
neous, was delivered like a prepared
oration.
He showed that the policy of the
Combes Ministry was the complete
separation of church and state and .
that such a separation would save
France money and secure future peace
for the state.
Sherriffs is an experienced debater,
having represented Stanford or#the In- â¢
tercon?giate team last year. He is a
senior in the law department, registers
from San Jose, and Is a member of the
Kappa Sigma and Phi Delta Phi fra
ternities. The other Stanford speakers i
were D. D. Sales and R. G. Barnett.
The debaters for California were E.
C. Baker, M. E. Harrison and W. J.
Musgrove. President David Starr Jor
dan presided at the debate and intro
duced the speakers. The Judges were
Professor Louis Lisser of San Fran
cisco. Rev. G. W. Stone of Oakland and
President M. E. Dailey of the San Jose
Normal School.

- kCORBIN IS INNOCENT
OF THE CHARGES OF MISUSING THE FUNDS OF
HIS ASSOCIATION, DECLARES THE GRAND JURY
DECISION IS UNANIMOUS
NOT TO FIND TRUE BILL
Continental Building and Loan Manager Is
Virtually Exonerated.
Gavin McNab as a Witness Clears the
Minds of Jurors.
By a unanimous vote the Grand Jury
last night decided. that there was no
foundation for a charge of embezzle
ment against William Corbin. secre
tary and manager of the Continental
Building and Loan Association. It
w&s furthermore agreed in manner not
without emphasis that no more time
should be wasted in investigation of
the affairs of the company, for after a
thorough inquiry into all the charges
that have been made of mismanage
ment and misappropriation of funds
th<? jurors came to the conclusion that
there was absolutely no basis for them.
In fact, the jurors were very much dis
gusted because they had been led into
the investigation.
Gavin McXab. fresh from the sensa
tional field of Sacramento, was the
most important witness last evening.
He^was dragged forth from a happy
dinner party at his brother's home and
came before the Jurors in evening
dress. But the result was far more
than worth the sacrifice of a peaceful
dinner. As attorney for the Conti
nental Building and Loan Association
he has not been spared in the whole
sale allegations of fraud, and the vin
dication of Corbin pleased him
mightily.
Nab "as very much in earnest
hen he explained all to the grand
jurors. His voice rang loud with ear
nestness in describing as unjust and
malicious the effort tliat has been
made to ruin the association. The
campaign to destroy the concern by
discrediting its officials, he declared,
was but a part of a desperate political
scheme to undo himself and Dr.
Washington Dodge, who is president
of the Continental. .v ,
There had been no embezzlement of
funds whatever, he declared. Long
years ago. he explained, there had
been difficulty between the directors
and Manager Corbin. But the witness
knew nothing of the ancient difficul
ties. He only knew that the company
had never lost a cent- He knew that
<_"orbins transactions had always bee.i
marked by a high standard of honor.
The basis for this charge was so old
that the statute of limitations had
long ago estopped prosecution, if any
crime had been committed.
As to"" the accusation against Cor-,
bin that- he misused 527.000 or any
other sum a year ago. McXab said
there was absolutely no truth in the
allegation. .Not a .cent -had been
(fully used, and the books would
fhow this /act conclusively. He suc
veeded in ' convincing the jurors be.
yond â venture.
ThÂ«? result of the inquiry, on which
th* Grand Jury has spent two pro
â¢racted sessions, going Into every de
tail of the testimony presented, was
a decision, speedily arrived at after
McXab had been excused, not to file
a true bill. There was not a dissent
ing voice. The investigation was
thorough, for all the evidence that
has been gathered was heard, and the
action of the Grand Jury is virtually
p.n exoneration of Corbin and the offi'
Â«prs of the corporation. :\' "

! cusers. witnesses and judges have de
parted for the city, but in the mean
while purveyors of rumors are not idle.
j nor is District Attorney Seymour of
Sacramentu. nor County Detective
O'Xeil.'
Bright and early this morning: De
tective O'Xeil. armed with a search
warrant, arrived at the State House.
X and Tenth streets, where Senator
Emmons has apartments. Producins:
his warrant of authority the detective
asked that he be permitted to search
the hotel safe to determine whether
any of the marked bills were concealed
therein. The hotel proprietor complied
without protest and for half an hour
the detective searched every nook and
< <>rner. but without success. He brought
to light $100 in gold that belonged to
Senator Emmons. but as the detective
was looking for bills only, the coin was
allowed to remain where it was.
Senator Emmons arrived shortly
after the detective concluded his labors
and said that he was glad the action
had been taken and hoped the detective
would search his room, for he would
find nothing there and this would add
Borne weight to his contention that he
is innocent.
After searching the safe the detec
tive continued on his quest of the bills.
As to whether he succeeded in finding
any of them is not known, but it is be
lieved that he did not. Word went out
to-night that since the consummation
of the alleged bribery not less than
thirty detectives have been scouring
the city in search of the bills, with
what success is not known. A rumor
is also in circulation to the effect that
one of Harry Morse's men trailed one
of the accused Senators to a San Fran
cisco bank the day after he received
the bills, and gathered in the entire lot
after the Senator had exchanged them
for gold. This story, like the rest,
lacks confirmation.
MANY RUMORS AFI/OAT.
The theory is voiced to-nijtht (every
one is looking for a theory to which to
pin his faith) that some of these bills
are in possession of the prosecution,
but that it did not present them dur
ing the presentation of its case in
chief, having a well-defined object in
view. The statute relating to bribery
directs that any legislator so accused
shall be compelled to testify, but that
any statement he may make shall not
thereafter be used against him, except
as a basis for prosecution for perjury.
It is the intention of the prosecution,
it is said, to permit the accused Sena
tors to take the stand, permit them to
deny with all the vehemence they are
capable of that they took the bills,
then present the recovered bills, to
gether with witnesses that saw them
passed by the accused, and demand
warrants for their arrest on charges of
perjury, in addition to those on charges
of bribery.
There is sosne criticism here as to the
methods used by Corbin and his advis
ers to entrap the Senators. Some say
that officers of the law should have
been posted to arrest the boodlers the
minute they took the bills and estab
lish their guilt through the simple
process of searching them. But these
critics do not bear in mind that the
purpose of the prosecution was to
catch four, not one of the alleged brib
ers. Had that plan beea followed out
the first man to take the money would
have been arrested, the alarm would
have gone out and the rest would have
escaped even the suspicion of guilt.
PLANS ARE SPOILED.
The prosecution had this end of the
â net! cared for, it develops, but the
sudden action of the Senate in issuing
a warrant for Corbin on contempt pro
ceedings spoiled its plans. It was forced
to show its hand too soon, and the de
tectives posted to follow the movements
of all the accused found themselves
without a job. because it was apparent
that after the exposure the accused,
though they may have been burdened
under the weight of marked bills, would
take rare to see that they remained un
passed while the excitement lasted.
Monday night the hearing will again
go on. with half a hundred character
witnesses present. This means that a
tiresome session awaits the trial com
mittee.
When the people generally learned
through this morning's Call that Sen
ator French had assaulted Detective
Tichenor any sympathy for the accused
Senator that may have remained de
parted. All are inclined to support
Tichenor's theory that French, if inno
cent, should have assaulted Joseph S.
Jordan, because the testimony estab
lishes the fact that it was Jordan who
told Tichenor he had paid French the
bribe money. Tichenor was simply re
peating Jordan's story, and if French
feels he must fight it is agreed that
Jordan should be the object of his
wrath.

Five Hundred Schoolboys
Join in Quest of Girls Who
Mysteriously Disappeared
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Feb. 3.â Five hundred
school boys are to-day engaged, In
searching the district of Vancouver Isl
and, between Souttifield and Nanalmo,
for the Rogers and Jones girls, who
have not been seen since January 10.
The girls wandered away from school
at Nanaimo and a thorough search has
so far failed to reveal their
abouts. Searchers to-day were formed
into squads of six under a careful
leadc-r.
Mrs. Walker, a clairvoyant of Van
couver, claims to have learned, while in
a trance, that an old Englishman, liv
ing with an Indian, in a hut four miles
from a railroad track near Ladysmith,
on the afternoon of January 10, while
returning from Nanaimo, came across
the girls on the railroad track and took
them home. She says both children are
ill, particularly the youngest.
John R. Packard of Albernl writes
the chief of police of Nanaimo describ
ing another spot where he believes the
children will be found. The searchers
are to-day trying to locate this spot,
though Packard gives no reason for his
belief.
CHARGES DISCRIMINATION
ON THE PART OF RAILROADS
Witness Before Senate Committee ou
Interstate Commerce Complains
of Secret Agreements.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 3.â E. H. Fer
guson of Duluth. Minn., representing
the retail and shippers' association,
continued his statement before the Sen
ate Committee on Interstate Commerce
to-day. He made especial complaint of
the secret routelng agreements of the
railroad companies operating in the
fruit centers of the West. This ar
rangement enabled the railroads to se
lect lines without consulting the ship
pers, and Ferguson said that loss and
inconvenience often resulted to perish
able goods. He charged discrimination
by the railroads in the interest of the
Armour private refrigerating car line
company, saying that the charres of
that company were often double those
of railroad lines themselves. This, he
said, was due to the exclusive con
tracts which the Armour Comoanv had
been able to procure, and he asserted
that the organization and success of
the beef trust were traceable to those
contracts.
In reply to questions Ferguson ex
pressed the opinion that the railroad
officials were interested in private car
companies, but that the railroad com
panies themselves secured no benefits
from the arrangement with the compa
nies.
CHOCTAW INDIAN IN SUIT
AGAINST CABINET OFFICERS
Seeks to Enjoin Them From Pa. vine
Big Fee Granted to a
Law Firm.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3.â Summonses
were to-day served on Secretary of the
Treasury Shaw. Secretary of the Inte
rior Hitchcock and United States
Treasurer Roberts in proceedings insti
tuted against them by Richard McLish,
a Choctaw Indian, to enjoin them from

law firm of Murray, Mansfield & Cor
nish of South McAlester, I. T., for ser
vices In "purifying" the citizenship
rolls of the Choctaw Indians. The
award was made under authority of an
act of Congress.
McLish charged that the firm secured
this fee by fraudulently concealing and
withholding the fact that the firm al
ready had been paid salaries aggre
gating $15,000 a year for their services
and sums aggregating approximately
$200,000 for their expenses.
AIMED AT WHEAT DRAWBACK.
Amendment to Sundry Civil Bill Intro-
duced by Hansbrough.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 8. â Senator
Hansbrough to-day introduced in the
form of an amendment to the sundry
civil bill a measure which if adopted
would have the effect of repealing the
drawback provision of the Dingley act,
in so far as it applies to wheat.
The amendment has been referred
to the Committee on Appropriations
and when it comes up for considera
tion Senator Hansbrough will argue
the necessity of its enactment on the
ground that the general drawback pro
vision of the Dingley act was not in
tended by the framers of that meas
ure to apply to wheat, although under
the recent decision of Attorney Gen
eral Moody drawback will be allowed

flour in the absence Â©f some Congres

Hold-Over Committee Deals
With Affairs of Association
and Its Financial Troubles
BLAME FOR SHOKTAGE
Smallness of Legislatures'
Appropriations, Say Solons,
Caused All the Difficulty
Special Dispatch to The Ca.ll.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 3.â The hold
over committee appointed at the last
session of the Legislature to investi
gate the affairs of the State Agricul
tural Society reported to-day. The com
mittee goes into details as to the
causes that led to the society's finan
cial difficulties and holds that they
were brought about by insufficient ap
propriations of the Legislature, politi
cal interference in the appointment of
subordinates and improper methods of
conducting races and installing agri
cultural exhibits. After recommending
that these evils be corrected, the com
mittee goes on to say:
The total indebtedness of the society to De
cember 16, 1908. with Interest and salaries
charged to February, 1904, amounted to $88,
797 96. Credits: rash balance, $SB3 57: bank
balance. $282 57; State appropriation, $15,000.
Net indebtedness December 16, 1903 $72 -
631 81.
In addition to the above indebtedness there
wan an indebtedness of $7110 due the Califor
nia Stats Bank and $639 90 interest to July 1,
1904, together with money collected as entrance
to futurity stakes and unpaid bills, amounting:
in the aggregate to $9910 51, making- a total
Indebtedness on July 1. 1904, of $90,292 22.
Between July 1. 1904. and January 1, 1905.
a further indebtedness of $9444 10 was created
by reason of damage to the pavilion from
storms and destruction of fence* and buildings
on the fair grounds, making & total indebted
ness on January 1, 1905. of $09,736 22.
The committee is of the unanlmoua opinion
that if this Legislature desires to continue the
existence of the State Agricultural Society and
carry on a yearly exhibit of Us resources as
is contemplated by the act creating said so
ciety it should appropriate sufficient money
therefor and in an amount not less than
fIBO.OOO.
DISCUSS INTERSTATE
COMMERCE LEGISLATION
Railway Presidents Recognize the
Reasonableness of Governmen- â¢
tal Regulation or Rates.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3.â A. B. Stick
ney of St. Paul, president of the Chi
cago Great Western Railway, to-night
delivered an address on "The Defects of
Interstate Commerce Law" before the
regular monthly meeting of the Wash
ington Economic Society. Among those
in the audience were Commissioners
Knapp, Prouty and Clements of the In
terstate Commerce Commission. Stick
ney's chief point was: "As all the pur
poses of the law relate to the schedule
of rates, and as none of the purposes
can be accomplished without a sched
ule, it seems evident that the most se
rious defect in the law is its failure to
authorize the. commission to make a
schedule of interstate rates."
PHILADELPHIA. Feb. 3.â A. J. Cas
satt, president of the Pennsylvania
Railroad, in an Interview on interstate
commerce legislation, says that the
management of the Pennsylvania Com
pany had for several years recognized
the reasonableness of legislation pro
viding for governmental regulation of
rates, under proper safeguards, to the
owners of railway properties. He be
lieved there was now a general disposi
tion to acquiesce in proper legislation
on this subject. Cassatt said the ques
tion of preventing discriminations of
preferences between shippers, by the
payment of rebates or by any other de
vice, seemed to be confounded in the
minds of the public with that of gov
ernmental regulation of rates.
Discriminations were already dealt
with by the Federal statute known as
the Elkins act. passed in 1903. he said,
in as effective a way as it is possible in
any legislative enactment, unless per
haps in the case of private car lines,
where further legislation might possi
bly be needed to bring them under the
provisions of the Elkins act. and that
this would be met by the Overstreet
bill, which is now pending in Congress.

CARE OF THE LEPERS.
Surgeon General Wyman Appears Be-
fore House Committee.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 3.â The care of
lepers in the United States and HawaH
was considered to-day by the House
Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce. Two bills, one providing
for the establishment of a sanitarium
in this country to which may be scrjt
all lepers in the United States, and
another appropriating $150,000 to be
used in Hawaii for the scientific study
of the disease, were before the com
mittee. Delegate Kalanianoale ex
plained brieffy the condition of lepers
in the Hawaiian Islands. The diminu
tion of the revenues of the islands,
owing to their absorption by the United
States, he said amounted to $1,250,000
annually, and for this reason the Fed
eral Government was asked for an ap
propriation, not to care for the lepers,
but to prosecute a scientific study of
the disease with the view of finding
some remedy therefor.
Surgeon General Wyman of the Pub
lic Health and Marine Service explain
ed the need of the leprosarium in this
country. He said there were known to
be 275 persons afflicted with the disease
in the United States and he estimated
there were 100 others. They are Bcat
tered through the States and Terri
tories. He suggested to the committee
a site in the arid region of the South
west.
The committee authorised a favor
able report on both bills.

KEANE MAKES
LOSING FIGHT
Efforts to Prevent Passage
of Liquor Bill in Senate
Receive but Little Support
LOCAL DEALERS HURT
Measure Provides for Confis
cation of Spirits for a
Violatiou of State Laws
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 3.â Senator
Keane put up a strong but futile fight
in the Senate this morning to amend
Broughton's bill that permits of the
confiscation and destruction of liquors
involved in a violation of State, county
or municipal regulation, jcveane said
that he had no objection to the bill if
the words "county or municipal" were
stricken therefrom, but that if the bill
was passed as written it would stand
as a grave menace to tne large inter
ests of liquor dealers of San Francis
co, who are always more or less sub
ject to assault from first one belligerent
civic body and then another.
If the bill were passed without
amendment in accordance with his
ideas, he said a liquor man might sud
denly find himself stripped of thou
sands of dollars' worth of property for
the most trivial breach of some of the
hundreds of municipal regulations.
Keane, however, found little support.
Half a dozen Senators took a fling at
the liquor business in San Francisco
and then the motion to amend was
put to a vote. Markey and Nelson of
San Francisco alone voted withÂ»Keane
and the bill will go to the Assembly as
it stands.
The Finance Committee reported to
the Senate this morning in favor of the
bill appropriating $300,000 for the con
struction of a hotel in Yosemite Val
ley. The bill will not be placed on the
file, however, until after the vote has
been taken on the re-cession measure
and then it will be withdrawn in the
event the State is authorized to re-cede
the park to the National Government.
The committee also reported in favor of
a majority of the bills appropriating
funds for the completion of the present
buildings and the construction of new
dormitories at the Glen Ellen Home for
the Feeble Minded; also the bill appro
priating $3000 for the purchase from
the heirs of the Cogswell estate of pic
tures of Abraham Lincoln and William
McKinley, it being the purpose to place
the pictures in the State Capitol.
A bill was introduced this morning
to grant the right to Lake County to
drain the bed of Clear Lake and re
claim the lands, the title to such lands
to thereafter vest in the county. A bill
was also introduced prohibiting the sale
of liquors within one and one-half
miles of the Veterans' Home at Yount
ville.
Coggins' bill vesting the Governor
with the right to restore to citizenship
under certain conditions persons who
have been deprived of such right
through conviction of crime was finally
passed and sent to the Assembly.
The Realty Syndicate of Oakland,
through F. C. Havens, this morning
petitioned the Senate in general session
to order at its earliest convenience an
Investigation by a committee of its af
fairs. The petition recites that in an
swer to subpena officers of the syndi
cate, bearing books, and papers, ap
peared at the rooms of the Committee
on Commissions and Retrenchment last
Monday, but did not secure a hecring.
Subsequently these officers went As
semblyman Waste and caused him to
introduce a bill providing that corpora
tions whose functions are the same as
those of the Realty Syndicate be placed
under the inspection of the Bank Com
mission.
Last evening, the petition continues,
these officers went before the commK
tee appointed to take up the work that
has been removed from the jurisdic
tion of the Committee on Commiastons
and Retrenchment and was informed
that it would have to wait till some fu
ture day before it could explain the
condition of its affairs.
The petition was ordered printed in
the journal and will be taken up early
next week.
DIES SUDDENLY IN CHURCH
AS SHE KNEELS IN PRAYER
Mr-. Evelyn Cashman. Wife of a San
Francisco Actor. Passes Away
in Xew York.
NEW YORK. Feb. 3.â Mrs. Evelyn
Cashman, about 38 years old, an artist,
living at 320 West Thirtieth street,
died suddenly to-day in St. Francis
German Catholic Church.
Rev. Father Fugensuis had finished
celebrating the 8 o'clock mass and was
walking down the aisle of the church,
when he saw the woman in a pew. She
was in an attitude of prayer. The
clergyman stepped up to her and
touched her on the shoulder. Receiv
ing no response, he summoned Dr.
Houley, who pronounced the woman
dead.
In the woman's purse was found a
card with the name "Evelyn Cashman,
care of Frank Mayne, No. 246 West
Thirty-eighth street."
Mayne was summoned and he identi
fied the body as that of Mrs. Cashman.
Her former husband, Mayne said, was
at one time connected with the Ttvoli
Stock Company of San Francisco.
Captain Hayes went to the woman's
boarding-house in Thirtieth street,
where he found several paintings bear
ing the name "Evelyn Temple." In ad
dition to the card found in the wo
man's purse, there were also found
four pawn tickets calling for articles
valued at 1140. There was also $6 30 in
cash.
Harry Cashman, who was formerly
the comedian at the old Tivoli and
played a short season at the Grand
Opera-house with the Fischer Com
pany, has been in Seattle in a stock
company for several weeks. His pres
ent wife. Irene Cashman. has been with
him during this time. Mrs. Cashman
yesterday telegraphed her father. De
tective Lynch, at the Palace Hotel that
she would be in this city in a few days.
Nothing is known here of a former
wife of Cashman.

REFUSE TO RECONSIDER
THE RECESSION MEASURE
Assemblyman Makes Vain Attempt to
Revive Bill and His Motion Is
Promptly Laid on Table.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 3.â Jones of
Tuolumne was not present in the As
sembly this morning to make his prom
ised motion for the reconsideration of
the vote upon which the (bill for the
re-cession of the Yosemite Valley was
passed, important business callinar him
away. It would have done him no
good, for the motion would have been
shelved.
Hawkins moved that the day on
which reconsideration was to be asked
be extended. This and also a motion
to reconsider at once were laid on the
table. The fight against the re-cession
of the valley to the people of the
whole nation, for whom it was taken
in trust by the pioneers to save it from
private acquirement, is ended as far
as the lower house is concerned.
Jones of San Francisco has succeeded
in securing a favorable report from
committee on his constitutional amend
ment exempting the Cogswell Poly
technic School from taxation. A rec
ommendation that it be passed was
filed to-day.
Prescott's bill making it a misde
meanor, punishable by fine not to ex
ceed $50, for any public school teacher
or public school authority to exploit
or try to secure the purchase of any
supplemental books recommended for
the use of pupils, under the provision
of the act, was passed.
A motion made by Anthony that when
the Assembly adjourn it be till 10
o'clock Monday morninit was vigor
ously fought and it was finally with
drawn by its author. Dunne the ar
gument Dorsey of Kern said if the ad
journments from Friday to Monday
were continued the members of the
house would find themselves workinr
twenty days beyond the statutory sixty
days and at their own expense, as the
file was getting crowded.
At the afternoon session there was
read a petition from Superior Judge
Lucas F. Smith of Santa Cruz County,
in which he said that to save any
members of the Assembly from the
task of presenting the impeachment
charges against him that had been
prepared in Santa Cruz County, he
would ask that they be considered filed
and that a committee of five Repub
licans, he being a Democrat, be ap
pointed to investigate the charges,
which the Judge declared false and
malicious. He asked that the inquiry
be held in his own county and said
that if he did not prove the accusa
tions false he would pay all the ex
penses.
The special committee to investigate
probably will be appointed as re
quested.
After the second reading of bills had
been carried on for some time it was
discovered that here was no longer a
quorum present. A call of absentees
was ordered, but not enough could be

Arrested for Distiarbamice
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
It was not without reluctance that
Mrs. Clayton unfolded her grievance to
iceman, for she considered the ten
der ag^s of the five defendants, the old
f whom had not attained man's es
tate, and exhausted every other avail
able means of quelling the disturbance
created by them before she enlisted the
law'e aiG. Far was it from her desire
to be instrumental in the sending of
five working lads to prison, but she
: could not afford to be driven from her
home by the racket they made every
evening. She and her family occupied
'. the lower floor of the house at Alice
and Shipley streets, between Third and
' Fourth, and the Greeleys were domi
; ciled on the second story. Before the
! Widow Greeley was removed to a hos
pital she managed to keep her 16-year
; old son Joe in order, but no sooner was
: he freed from her restraining influence \
J than he' began the nocturnal wassails i
i complained of. Hi* invited guests on 1
*each occasion were Ivester Sullivan, Joe j
! Lascarettes, Walter Brownlee and Fred
j Wyman, his equals in age, and j boister-
of temperament, and it was the
"wont of the quintet to make night as i
hideous as 5t could be made. without ;
' damaging the furniture. Appeals for
peace filed by Mrs. Clayton and other
J neighbors were ignored. Singing, dane
; ing and shouting were the chief con
stituents of the din.
- . No attempt was made by an alert de
"fense to deny that the boys sang. What
if they did sing? Was it not better for
them to assemble beneath the roof tree
of one of their number and spend their
evenings with "music than to roam the
streets or frequent saloons? What if it
were stated that the meetings in Mas
ter Greeley's home were likely to de
velop a vocal organization that would
contribute largely to the social life of
the South. Side? Maybe the complain
ing witness had not heard the defend
ants sing their most pleasing selection:
You never suoke like that to m* before, John;
. You always had a kind word and a. smile;
My heart tells me at last
Your love for me. is past.
For you never HNS* like that to me before.
If the boys had raised their voices
in ribald sentiment there might have
been good ground for the complaint
that led to their arrest. But the prose
cution was defied to prove that any ex
cept the /tenderest and purest thoughts
were vocally expressed. As for the mi
i sinuation that the voices did not blend
harmoniously and that their pitch was
unnecessarily high, it might be an
swered by a counter-insinuation that
the persons who had so said. were not
â¢ competent music critics and therefore
were disqualified to testify. But innu
. endo was hardly needed to convince the
; court that it would be unjust to punish
the quintet. . :
Judge Mogan gave himself until this
. morning to think it over, and permitted
the defendants to go free on their own
crnizance.
v iadly did David Jenkins stutter
that it was difficult to believe the com
plaint charging him with orally abus
ing a* well as battering Thomas Mad

with a bandaged head and averred that

James Merrick was plodding along
Dupont street, with umbrella aloft and
head bowed, for he was facing wind

police aid. Mr. Merrick was found
guilty of battery and will be sentenced

the charge of assault with a deadly
weapon which he *had entered against
16-year-old Michael O'Keefe, by whom
he was stabbed four times with a pen
knife last Sunday morning at the de
fendant's home.
"It was my duty to swear to the com
plaint," Baid the captain, "but the boy
seemed to be temporariyl insane, and as
he had always been a good boy and a
friend of mine I forgive his offense."
'â¢Neither his physiognomy nor his

he has always been a good boy," said
the Judge, "but as there are no other
witnesses to prosecute him I will take
your testimony under advisement until

James Fenwick pleaded guilty to j

"I said he raised hâlh â 1 in general. I

"Don't say it again," thundered the

"Well, he said he would knock all

"He's a drunken bum." she snapped,

ALL LINES ARE ACTIVE
Railway Earnings Increase
and Failures Decline in
Amount of Money Involved
NEW YORK*. Feb. B.â Dun's weekly
review of trade to-morrow will say.
Business progresses steadily, all spec- |
ulative excesses having been avoided |
thus far, and the numerous negotia- j
tions now pending indicate that the j
maximum of activity is yet to come.
Some irregularity is reported for the
first month and was undoubtedly due
to the exceptionally cold weather.
Taken as a whole the record for Jan
aary was very much better than in
the same month last year, particularly
as to failures.
Distribution of merchandise is once
more on a liberal scale, traffic block
ades having disappeared, and in many
cases large clearance sales have been
disposed of. Few labor disputes are in
terrupting work, although several new
controversies are threatened. Iron fur
naceÃ and steel mills operate close to
their full capacity and the quarterly
report of the leading concern showed
an enormous tonnage of business on
the books at the end of the year, de
spite the fact that the closing months
of 1904 made very good exhibits. Rail
way earnings for January were 1.1 per
cent larger than a year ago, and for
eign commerce at this port for the last
week showed an increase of $970,980 in
exports and a gain of $528,067 in im
ports.
Failures this week In the United
States are 259, against 305 last week
and 246 last year. Failures in Canada
number 30, against 33 last week and 34
the preceding week and 29 last year.
BRADSTREET'S REPORT.
Bradstreefs to-morrow N will say:
Widespread â¢-. cold .. weather hampers
trade in nearly all lines, thus retarding,
but not entirely checking the opening
of spring distribution. Except in a few
cases, â  however, notably transportation
and mining, industry displays rather
less than seasonable interference > and
the feeling is strong that milder. weath
er will usher in widespread activity in
all lines. The late freeze in Florida did
much damage to fruit and truck crops.
January clearings are the largest ever
recorded in that month. Failures . re- '
fleet the annual stock takings and bal
ancing of books, but the liabilities are
\ greatly reduced, compared with a year
ago. The South in this carries the
chief burden, in that * the increase for
the year reported by that section
shows, the largest liabilities of any
group of ' States. \ Signs 'â  of _~ Improve

A TRAINKD NVRSE SPKAKS OUT.
Trained nurses as a rule are a fine lot
of women, and if they were men would
make mapnifieent soldiers. They are
trained to obey to the minutest detail,
and it is seldom that one can be got to
express an opinion on any remedy, being
content to carry out the physician's or
riere. SpÂ»rikins on the subject, one of the
best known nurses of Pittsburgh Pa., said:
"I only recall one case where I felt called
upon to Â«peak right out and tell the doc
tors what I thought. I had been called in
to attend 'an old lady suffering with
chronic constipation and whose enfeebled
condition precluded the use of cascara,
rhubarb, licorice or other powerful pur
gat ivr-s. The doctors were giving the pa
tient large doees of olive oil without any
appreciable result. I insisted upon Red
Raven, knowing that as a laxative,
though mild. It was exceedingly sure. To
my delight thÂ»_ doctors, after consulta
tion, prescribed a bottle every morning
for three mornings. A prompt change
came over the patient and in a few days
she was relieved. This is the only expe
rience I ever had with Red Raven in a
critical illness, but in a number of mild
attacks of constipation, torpid liver,
headache and biliousness, I have known
them to bring quick relief."

Raven â a sparkling mineral water In

SWAYNE MAKES
FORMAL REPLY
Accused Judge Admits the
Facts Charged, but Seeks
to Justify His Actions
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3.â Through his
counsel Judge Swayne to-day made
formal response in the Senate to the
articles of impeachment voted by the
House of Representatives. The answer
was a formidable document in point of
size. Each of the twelve articles of Im
peachment was answered at length. In
every case the fact charged was admit
ted, but explained from Judge Swayne's
point of view. In addition it was con
tended that even if the contentions
were true, as charged, they were not of
a character to justify proceedings for
impeachment for "high crimes and mis
demeanor."
The answer was read by former Sen
ator Thurston, and when he concluded
the Senate issued an order requiring
the House to file its formal reply by
next Mjnday and directed that all
pleadings be in by February 9, so that
the trial may proceed on February 10.
Taking up first the charge of receiv
ing $10 a day for expenses, Swayne in
his response admitted the receipt of the
money as charged, but denied that his
! conduct in this respect was contrary to
\ law, as the allowance of $10 a day was
1 intended to be a fixed and definite al
; lowance for Judges when holding court
\ outside their districts. Judge Swayne
; said that other Judges generally have
| drawn the full amount of $10 a day,
t and that up to the beginning of the
i present proceeding he had not received
[ any intimation from the auditing office
of the Treasury Department, or from
others, that his course in accepting the
full amount allowed was contrary
either to law or to custom.
The charge that Judge Swayne had
appropriated to his own use a railway
car of the Jacksonville, Tampa and
Key West Railway Company was part
ly denied. Judge Swayne admitted the
use of the car, but said that it was oc
cupied by himself and friends in going
from Delaware to Florida on the invita
tion of the receiver of the road.
Judge Swayne also denied that he
failed to establish a residence in hia
district in Florida. He admitted fre
quent absences on account of the visits
to his family, the holding of court else
where and because of a tour in Europe,
but contended that there has been no
offense in this respect of a character to
justify impeachment for high crimes
and misdemeanor.
The charge of committing E. T. Da
vis to jail for contempt he admitted, !
but justified it as a public duty. With i
reference to the charge that he had
presided in a suit relating to real estate
In Florida In which he was interested.
Judge Swayne denied the holding of
such interest.
The Senate,, sitting as a court, then
adjourned and resumed legislative con
sideration of the joint statehood bill.
Stone spoke in opposition to the meas
ure, particularly on the provisions re
lating to the Indian Territory. Berr*
followed Stone, saying it was not true,
as has been asserted in the debate, that
all the people wanted Oklahoma and
Indian Territory united as one State.
Morgan said that each of. the Territo
ries should be admitted Into the Union
as a- State, and that to fail so to admit
them would be an act of bad faith.

Clarence Lubben of
Alameda Is
Victim.
SPINAL DISEASE
FOLLOWS INJURY
School Chiefs Fail
to Find Authors
of Mischief.
INVESTIGATION
PROVES FUTILE
ALAMEDA. Feb. Clarence Lub
ben. the S-year-old pupil of the Long
fellow Grammar School, who has been
lying ill for several weeks at his home,
â¬30 Pacific avenue, died at 11:40 o'clock
to-night from spinal meningitis. His
disease .nd resulting death were |
caused, it is believed, by the rough
usage the lad received at the hands of
his schoolmates, who tossed the little
fellow in the air in imitation of hazing
as practiced in large educational insti
tutions. The boy has been sinking for
some time and hope of his recovery 1
was abandoned several days ago.
School Superintendent Fred T. Moore
to-day conducted a rigid investigation
of boy pupils at the Longfellow Gram
mar School in this*al!eged case of haz
ing. Mr. Moore was unable to fix the
blame or responsibility for the Lubben
iad's injury upon any of the boys ex
amined.
After carefully considering the situa
tion last night and obtaining all the
information possible from the newspa
pers and other sources Superintendent
MoorÂ« to-day decided thoroughly to in
vestigate the hazing of the Lubben
child. He went to the Longfellow
School and with Principal Carl J. Phil
ippi, Janitor James Burton and De
tective George Brown of the Police De
partment subjected all the students
â whose names had been mentioned in
connection with the affair to a search
ing examination. The boys were sum
moned from their class rooms to tell
what they knew relative to the af
fair. Numerous discrepancies marked
the testimony given by the lads, whose
ages ranged from 7 to 14. Some said
that young Lubben was tossed on the
10th of January and others that he was
tossed on the 17th of trie same month.
Xo two witnesses agreed as to the time,
place or persons concerned in the
"â¢bouncing."
Several boys said they thought three
lads had done the tossing. The superin
tendent then picked out a pupil about
the size of Clarence Lubben and or
dere him to lie on the floor while three
other boys were told to toss him in the
air. They were unable to do so.
LITTLE INFORMATION' GAINED.
Principal Philippi and Janitor Burton,
who had done some detective work
among the pupils in the school yard,
pave Mr. Moore the evidence which
they obtained and which the Superin
tendent made use of in examining the
young witnesses. Nevertheless, the Su
perintendent and principal were unable
to accuse any of the boys questioned
of having been implicated in the alleged
hazing of a schoolmate, and the fur
ther the investigation proceeded the
more remote appeared the possibility of
definitely charging any boy or number
of boys with having injured Clarence
Lubben.
. Among the lads questioned were Ed
tv in Schroeder. Lumen Chandler. War- <
ren Fisk, Lawrence Steele, Albert Rid
ley. Ellis Kiser, Samuel Havery, Albert
Hastie, George Cull, George Blum, Har
ry Havery and Melville Brown.
Concerning the investigations In the
hazing cases Superintendent Moore
said:
The Lubben child may have been Injured
xvhile engaged in â¢â¢bouncing" with other boys,
but me cculd learn nothing definite. Some of
the boys said they remembered that Clarence

IN ICY WATERS
Sr>*cial Pispatch to The Call.
COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho. Feb. 3.â
In a soirit of revenge and to scare the
victim into leaving the country, a party
took aged Jonathan Frake? to the shore
of Lake Coeur d'Alene in the dead of
night and gave him a ducking in the
icy waters.
Frakes was accused of giving infor
mation in the land fraud cases which
are under investigation by special
agents of the Interior Department
working in Xorthern Idaho. One case
has attracted more than usual atten
tion. A man who made a homestead
entry in Washington under his true
name also made one in Idaho under an
other name and cut and sold 1,000,000
feet of timber to -buyers at Post Falls,
Harrison and Spokane.
When he sought to make final proof
the special agent started an investiga
tion and the purchasers of the timber
were forced to settle with the Govern
ment. It was presumably for giving
evidence in this case that Frakes was
maltreated. He live? at a lonely spot
on the lake shore and no one heard his
cries for help.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL. SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 4. 1905
ALAMEDA SCHOOL, OFFICIAL WHO IS CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION INTO
THE HAZING THAT LED TO THE DEATH OF LITTLE CLARENCE LUB
BEN. AND THE SCENE OF THE ALLEGED ROWDYISM.
LOWER RATES
ON MESSAGES
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3.â At the Cab
inet meeting to-day railroad rate leg
islation was under discussion. The
report of the Investigation made by the
Interstate Commerce Commission of
the charges that the Atchison, Topeka
and Santa Fe Railroad had granted re
bates to the Colorado Fuel and Iron
Company formed a basis for a part of
the discussion.
It is understood here that under an
act of r'ongress officials of a railroad
corporation who testify before the In
terstate Commerce Commission in an
investigation are rendered immune
thereby from prosecution for such of
fenses against the law as may be dis
closed by their testimony. Whether
officials of the same corporation who
do not testify also are immune from
prosecution for the offenses charged is
said to be a serious question of law.
Secretary Morton was one of the offi
cials of. the Atchison, Topeka and
Santa Fe Railroad who testified before
the commission during its investiga
tion of the rebate charges.
. Consideration ,of matters pertaining
to Alaska occupied some of the time
of the Cabinet. Much ; pressure ,' has
been brought to bear : upon. the Gov
ernment to induce the officials to facili
tate, the transmission of social and do
mestic HifWÂ»W> between the peooje, in
the United States and those in the in
terior ul v\l;isxji anu it uas uÂ«.ciaÂ» ii 10
reduce for such messages the c tele
graph tolls between . Valdez and such
Alaskan points as -are reached by t the
Government lines. Messages,' not ex
ceeding ten words 7 may be 'sent via
Valdez to or from Alaska points at a
toll of 50 cents or twenty-five words for
$1. The exchange of such messages! is
to be limited ;to two each month 1 be
tween any two persons. It is expected
that the Government, will, not^b.e able
to handle the: messages at this rate at
a profit, but" arrangement was sanc
tioned by the Cabinet in the interest of.
the people. >. V : VÂ»V :i . , ;1
The Government telegraph lines in
Alaska. Secretary Taft explained, are
being operated at a loss; Indeed, the
receipts from tolls pay scarcely more
than 25 per cent of the expenses of op
eration. It is expected, however, as
the Alaskan Territory is developed the
receipts will increase and eventually,
perhaps, will more than meet the op
erating expenses. The Secretary be
lieves the new arrangement will not af
fect the receipts to a greater extent
than 5 per cent of the aggregate of the
tolls from the Alaskan lines.
There was some incidental discussion
of Alaskan railroad matters, but no ac
tion was taken on the subject.

SHARP DEBATE
IN THE HOUSE
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3.â After near
ly a week of discussion on the post
office appropriation bill carrying $180,
787,415, it was passed by the House to
day.
An unsuccessful attempt was made
by Watson of Indiana, after a sharp
debate, to exclude ruraJ carriers from
the c-peration of the civil service reg
ulations. Watson charged that under
the present policy of appointments
there was being built up among the
rural carriers a political machine, and
he insisted that the Representatives in
Congress could be relied upon to recom
mend capable men for that service.
The chair sustained a point of order
against thg amendment.
The question of political activity by
postal employes and the course to 'je
adopted to prevent it was raised by
Griggs' of Georgia, who offered an
amendment providing that the uniting
by postal employes "with any associa
tion or organization which has for its
object the change of the relation of em
ployes to the Government shall be
cause for dismissal." The amendment
went out on a point of order.
Moon of Tennessee moved to recom
mit the bill with instructions to elitn
\ mate the provision for special mail
} facilities on trunk lines.
The motion to recommit was lost, 42
to 158, an.J the bill r.ien was passed
without division.
The House adjourned until to-mor
row.

LEADING. TOBACCO AND
CIGAR BUSINESS SOLD
Prominent Local Business Men Secure
Control of the M. Blaskower Co.'s
Wholesale Cigar and Tobacco
Buslnes*.
During the recent past it has been cor
rectly reported that the United Cigar
Stores Company, a corporation which is
conducting retail cigar stores on a large
scale in many of the leading cities of the
f'nitÂ«-d States, has acquired all of the
retail stores operated by the M Blas
kower Company. San Francisco, and it
has b?en generally supposed that the
wholesale business of the latter concern
was included in the purchase. It now
develops that the United Cigar Stores
Company ran up against formidable com
petition because it is authentically given
out by the parties interested that Mr
Blaskower has associated himself with
Mr. C. H. Schmidt and Mr. F. Tillmann
Jr.. gentlemen of considerable promi
nence In the wholesale cigar and tobacco
business, and they, jointly with Mr Blas
kowei. will continue the well-known anil
long-established wholesale business of
the M. Blaskower Company at its pres
ent location, 223-225 Montgomery street
and its future prospects under the guid
ance of those men, are promising Indeed
The amusing side of the deal is that
the Trust and its many representatives
who arc at present, in the city have been
completely outwitted by Messrs. Schmidt
and Tillmann. who cleverly and quietly
entered into negotiations with Mr. Blas
| kowfr for his wholesale business ana
; closed arrangements before the Trust
magnates realised that they did not have
things their own way.
The three gentlemen interested in the
Rlaskower Company intend to extend ani
exploit its business vigorously and to
conduct the same entirely independent of
any of their other business enterprises.
No doubt the many friends and patrons
lof Mr. Blaskowt-r will be pleaaed to
1 learn of this change.
INDIAN FUNDS
PROPERLY USED
Shown That President Acted
Within Rights in Dealing:
With Sectarian Schools
SCHARF IS REPUDIATED
Father Ketcham Says He Has \
No Connection With the
Catholic Mission Work ;
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3.â President
Roosevelt's connection with the diver
sion of Indian trust funds to the sup
port of Catholic mission schools is ex
plained and justified in a communication
addressed to the President by Attorney
General Moody, which was filed to-day
with the Senate Committee on Indian
Affairs by William H. Ketcham, direct
or of the bureau of Catholic missions.
Father Ketcham appeared before the
committee to defend his bureau against
the charges that it has been using un
due and political influences to secure
; the use of trust funds for Catholic
schools.
Moody's communication, dated Feb-
r uary 2, 1905, sets forth the record of a
! Cabinet meeting held in January, 1904,
; when the question of the use of Indian
funds for sectarian schools was dis
cussed and the President asked for an
opinion as to his authority to direct
that contracts be made for the use of
such funds by denominational educa
tional Institutions.
Senator Knox, then Attorney Gen
eral, said that the action of Congress in
; declaring it to be the policy of the Gov
ernment not to permit the use of the
public moneys of the American people
j for sectarian purposes did not repeal
| previous laws giving to the Secretary
I of the Interior discretion to use the In
i dlan funds in any manner he saw fit.
j Certain laws were cited to direct atten
; tlon to the President's authority in that
J regard.
MOODY'S COMMUNICATION.
In this communication Moody says;
By your direction I submit a statement of
i what occurred in January. IDO4, concerning
iuur decision to permit the uss oi the intfres.l
; upon certain funds held in trust by the
i Vnlted States for the purpose of sectarian
! schools.
The question was raised whether a certain
! declaration of Congress in appropriating tor
I Indian day, and Indus' rial scnoo.s precluded
the use of the funds in question In that way,
; and Mr. Russell of this department r'ce'ved a
note from Secretary HlUncock dated January
' 19. VMH. saying:
"The President hp.s requested me to inform
! you that there will be a meeting at the eiec
! utlve office in the Whit* House at 3 p. m. on
. Friday next (the 22d) to confer with reference
! to certain Indian matter? recently brought to
: your notice, at which meeting the President
, requests your presence."
The Attorney General (Mr. Knox) and Mr.
; Russell, w^o had been considering the ques
tion. proceeded to the meeting, at whk-h were
' present Secretaries Hitchcock. Cortelyou and
I Wilson and Postmaster General Payn?. Un
behalf of the Attorney General a memorandum
! Was sutimi.tted in favor of tht? legality of the
' use of the funds, and Secretary Hitchcock
I submitted a letter from th? Commissioner of
j Indian Affairs. Thereupon the question -rcas
discussed at length and left for your determl
i nation.
I>?ldes the memorandum referred to thÂ»r?
was a lonjc one giving the reasons for the con
clusion reached by the Attorney General, the
substance of which Mr. RussMl stated.
The brief memorandum whfch was left with
you was as follows, as appear* by a copy re
tained-at the Department of Justice:

Father Ketcham asserted that
Bishop Hare of the Episcopal church
knew a year a?Â« that the contracts
were being made and at that ume
made an inquiry of the Commissioner
cf Indian Affairs and had explained
to him the authority for the contracts.
It was declared further that Bishop
Hure was offered similar opportunities
for his schools, but declined to accept
them.
'If Bishop Hare had accepted this
aid in the same manner that the Luth
eran Synod accepted aid for their
schools in Wisconsin, then there would
have been no discussion of this mat
ter " said Father Ketcham. Reference
vas made by him to the annual ap
propriations by Congress to Hampton
Institute. Virginia, and other sectarian
schools. He said that what his bureau
was getting was not Government aid.
but payment for education from a
fund owned by the Indians and that
the aid was by direction of the In
dians' lawful guardians.

Berkeley Office Ran Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Feb. 3.
Two lads of Berkeley who ventured
out on the bay to shoot ducks, in a
boat without sail or oars, were this
morning rescued from death in the
waters by three other youths.
William Sweetman, 14 years old. of
Third and Delaware streets and Louis
OFarrell left the West Berkeley
wharf this morning in as unseaworthy
a craft as that part of the bay shore
boasted. They took a boat that had
been lying unused for a long time and
placidly pushed off from the shore,
content to drift with the wind and tide
out to where duck shooting might be
had. The tide carried them out three
miles from shore, the waves filled their
boat with water, but relief came from
three boys who saw their predicament.
Richard Richardson Jr., Paul Spring
er and Joseph Pachino put out from
the wharf with a 30-foot sloop. Their
glasses revealed the distress of the be
leaguered youngsters in the open boat,
and the rescuers reached the amateur
sailors none too soon. The daring hunt
ers and sailors had tight hold of the
buoy opposite the acid works on the
Berkeley shore, and there they clung,
drenched through, up to their waists in
water, expecting to perish any mo
ment. They were brought to shore and
taken to their homes.

REQUIRES THE COIN
AND NOT CERTIFICATES
OAKLAND, Feb. 3.â Mayor War
ren Olney to-day discovered that City
Treasurer Felton Taylor had $130,
000 of city money on deposit in local
banks, instead of in the safe deposit
vaults provided by the city. This the
Mayor declared was in violation of
the State law and he demanded that
the coin be produced. Taylor held
certificates of deposit on the Central
Bank and the First National Bank re
spectively for $90,000 and $40,000 in
lieu of the coin.
In explanation Treasurer Taylor
said that he had been compelled by
lack of space in the vaults to carry
the coin. He had not been provided
wirti proper vault room in the Treas
urer's office at the City Hall and had
therefore deposited the money in
banks, subject to immediate call. In
deference to the Mayor's inquiry,
Taylor cashed the certificates of de
posit and put the coin in the city's
vaults.

Crane Company Causes Ar
rest of George H. Jeffress,
the Firm's Oakland Agent
EXPERT PUT QN BOOKS
Charges the Withholding of
Money Collected for Ac
count of the Corporation
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 3.
George H. Jeffress, the Oakland man
ager for the Crane Company,- wholesale
dealers in plumbers' supplies at 21 First
street, San Francisco, was arrested this
afternoon at the company's branch
store, Twelfth and Webster streets, by.
Detective George Kyte on a charge or
embezzlement. The complaint, sworn
to by H. M. Haldeman, general man
ager of the Crane Company, makes a
specific accusation of the theft of $100.
Experts have been put at work on Jef
fress' books. Haldeman refuses to ex
press an opinion concerning the condi
tion of the accounts untij the'examina
tion has been completed.
Jeffress was taken to the City Prison
and held there awaiting bonds, which
were fixed at $2500. He sent for Attor
ney John J. McDonald,, and declined to
make any statement concerning his ar
rest. He had returned from a business
visit to San Jose and found Haldeman
and Detective Kyte waiting at the store
when he arrived. It is said that efforts
to compromise the financial troubles
were unsuccessful. So far as the charge
of stealing $100 is concerned, the Crane
Company people told the District At
torney that the shortage was uncovered
by the failure of Jeffress to remit the
full amount of a collection he had made
from one of the firm's patrons. It was
alleged that he had collected $200 and
had withheld one-half the amount.
Jeffress' arrest follows closely upon
the arrival of Haldeman from Chicago,
whence he came to succeed H. T. Lally
as Pacific Coast representative of the
company. Lally, who had been with
the company for many years, is said to
have resigned because the corporation
had installed a time clock check sys
tem in the office and had directed him
to register his arrivals and departures
the same as other employes.
Haldeman began to check up the ac
counts of the company with its branch
houses, and it is reported that the dis
crepancy charged against Jeffress was
thus brought to light.
Jeffress has been in the Crane Com
pany's employ for ten years. He was
stationed In San Francsico the first two
years, and was sent to~Oakland in
charge of the business here. In this
district he handled a large trade and
made practically all of the collections.
Haldeman said the firm had always
reposed confidence in the accused man
ager and had no reason to Buspect
there was anything wrong. He asserted
he knew nothing concerning Jeffress'
habits that might cast a doubt upon
his integrity. Jeffress is 42 years old,
married and lives at 1305 Third avenue.
He Is prominent ln Oakland, being a
member of a family of old residents.

FOSTER GRILLS
EXPERT HERR
Eailroad President Shines
Brilliantly as a Cross-
Examiner on Auditing
HIS QUESTIONS STING
Tries to Force Witness to
Admit That Methods Were
Loose and Services Poor
j Berkeley Office San Francisco Call.
; 2148 Center street. JFeb. 3.
The star figure in the investigation
conducted to-day at the university by
a Senatorial committee appointed to re
port on the financial affairs of the uni
versity was Regent A. W. Foster, rail
[ road president and chairman of the
finance committee of the Board of Re
gents. Foster served both as witness
and as cross-examiner of former aud
itor J. J. Herr. In both capacities he
gave important aid. The committee
concluded its sessions here this after
noon.
J. J. Herr, under the cross-question
ing of Regent Foster, was forced to ad
mit that his examination of the em
bezzling secretary's books had not re
vealed discrepancies between the rec
ord of moneys received and moneys ac
counted for in McKowen's reports.
Regent Foster had prepared a set of
questions addressed to Herr and to
these he requested that Herr answer
"yes" or "no."
"I don't care to argue matters with
you," said the regent to Herr; "I mere
ly want answers to my questions."
Some of the queries and the answers
thereto follow:
"Are you an expert bookkeeper?"
"Did you find that McKowen's system and
methods wr;re lax, and that McKowen was re
miss In his work?"
"Did you ever report such a thing to the re
gents?"
"If you had known that McKowen was a
man of bad habits and dishonest, would you
have reported it to the regents?"
Herr replied: "Surely, at once."
"If McKowen's laxneus was responsible, as
you say, for your failure to audit the books
regularly and also to detect discrepancies, why
did you not report the fact to the regents?"
"Because I was not supposed to make such
reports. ' '
"Did you examine all the books?"
"All the material books."
A MATERIAL BOOK.
"Was the book of minutes of tha regents a
material book?"
"Well, I examined that for a record of dis
bursements."
"Then it was a material book. But I will
now prove that the minutes of June 10, 1902,
contain a record of a donation of $500, made by
Rabbi Voorsanger for the ladies of Kmmanu-el
congregation In San Francisco, to be used for
the Err.manu-el fellowship for Semitic lan
guages at the university, wnlch donation was
not put upon McKowen's cashbook â money he
appropriated. You certified shortly after that
time that the books had been audited, but you
did not detect that and similar discrepancies,
did your'
"The minutes were not supposed to be ex
amined by me for such purposes. It being my
work merely to certify to the arithmetical
correctness of the books and reports which
McKowen submitted to me."
"That work," interjected Senator
Lukens, "could have been done well
enoupri by a freshman of ordinary in
telligence, could It not?"
Herr deigmed no answer to this.
Senator Carter asked the witness
whether he should not have detected
such discrepancies a* Regent Foster
had referred to and reported them to
the regents, but Herr reiterated that
his duties as auditor ended when he
found McKowen's papers and books,
submitted for auditing, to be mathe
matically accurate.
"I think," said Regent Foster, "that
I have shown by this witness that the
check on the secretary's accounts
which the auditor was supposed to give
us was not forthcoming."
Herr left the stand at noon and did
not return to the session in the after
noon.
FOSTER'S DOCUMENTS.
Regent Foster was sworn in the aft
ernoon. He produced documents to
prove that Herr's charges of laxness
against McKowen were unfounded,
showing where McKowen hal called
upon Herr to audit the books and that
the latter had not responded for many
months.
Chairman Carter intimated that the
regents, and particularly the finance
committee, of which Foster is chair
man, should have called oftener upon
Kerr for an audit when these audits
were not forthcoming regularly.
"How about McKowen's bond?"
queried Senator Carter of Regent Fos
ter. "Has that been collected yet?"
It was explained that a suit between
the State and the surety company on
McKowen's bond is now pending, the
company alleging that the life of the
bond had expired when the defalcation
occurred.
Regent Foster admitted that six
months had elapsed between the ex
piration of the bond and the time when
McKowen's stealings were discovered,
during which time the secretary was
not under bonds.
"We were not notified that the bond
had expired," said the regent. "Mc-
Kowen had been. notified by the surety
company, but he did not so inform the
regents."
Again Chairman Carter asked if the
regents were not derelict in permitting
the secretary to be not under bond for
so long a time, and the witness ad
mitted that some blame might attach
to the regents in the matter.
NO SUCCESSOR.
"Have you appointed McKowen's
successor yet?" asked Chairman Car
ter. Regent Foster said "no," and, be
ing asked for a reason, he said the re
gents desired a capable man for the
place, able to earn a salary of $500 a
month, which they were willing to pay,
and that pending the discovery of
such a man it was thought best to re
taing Acting Secretary Henderson.
Norman McLaren, who experted Mc-
Kowen's books after the latter's con
fession of theft, explained how the
shortages were discovered.
Regent F. W. Dohrmann was asked
regarding the award by the building
committee, of which he is a member,
of the contract to build California Hall
to a bidder whose bid was several
thousand dollars in excess of a com
pany that proposed to do the work.
He explained that the lower bidder
was not prepared to do the work, in
the opinion of the regents, and so the
award had been made to the other con
cern.
Mr. Dohrmann, questioned about the
appointment of a successor to Mc-
Kowen, declared that Acting** Secretary
Henderson filled the position 4to the
satisfaction of the regents.
The committee concluded its work at
5 o'clock and adjourned, after thank
ing the regents present and the uni
versity officers examined for their help
in conducting the investigation.

FAIL TO GAIN
THEIR RELEASE
Prison Doors Still Shut on
William Proctor and Boy
Ashberry, Awaiting Trial
JUDGE DENIES A WTUT
His Honor Believes They Are
Both Guilty of Defraud
ing Wealthy Niles Widow-
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 3.
Legal technicalities failed to open the
prison doors for William Proctor, the
wooer of aged widows, and his stepson
Roy Ashberry, who are under arrest
for inveigling Emily Tyson of Niles, a
widow of 75, into letting them have $108
in cash and several diamond rings.
Proctor, big and strapping and 45 years
of age, passed himself off as 59, pro
posed marriage, borrowed the money
and took the rings to have made into a
wedding present.
In ruling on the motion for a writ of
habeas corpus this morning Judge
Greene found that neither the money
nor rings had been used by them for
the purposes promised. He denied the
writ and said: "These men framed up
a contemptible piece of business, and
in my opinion the intent continues
throughout the entire proposition. Cer
tainly the evidence in the case is strong
enough to warrant holding them."
The plea made by Attorney Hugh
Aldrich was to the effect that there was
not sufficient legal evidence to hold
them and he read the transcript of the
preliminary examination to sustain his
contention, but which when he had fin
ished confirmed the Judge in the belief
as stated.
CLUB'S DANCE
WILL BE YEAR'S
GAYEST EVENT
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE
OAKLAND, Feb. 3.â lnvitations for the Pi
Delta Kappa dance are out and in their
richness of design promise a rare perfection
of arrangement for the great event which Is
scheduled for February 17. The cards are
beautifully engraved and the symbol of the
fraternity, embossed In gold, adds an ex
quisite finishing touch.
This particular fraternity includes some of
the most popular young men about town and
the committee In charge Is working hard to
make the coming dance one of the moat bril
liant affairs in the fraternity's history. Heed
Hall, which always lends itself readily to
any scheme of decoration, will, on this oc
casion, be the scene of an unusually artistic
and elaborate arrangement of â but there. I
almost told and I am sworn to darkest
secrecy. But at any rate the decorations as
planned will furnish a rare setting for the
many new and dainty dresses that are being
rushed to completion for the eagerly antici
pated event.
The committee, to which much credit must
bÂ« given for its artistic planning, is com
posed of Leslie Hayes Leslie Rice. Fred
Snowden, Harry Gray and George Conradi.

Mr. and Mrs. Page of Portland, Or., who
are visiting Mr. and Mrs. Frederick S. Strat
ton, were the recipients of a charming com
pliment this evening In the form of a dinner
a.t the Stratton home on Harrison street.
Twelve guests enjoyed the very elaborate
menu and later a musical feast. Mrs. Howard,
one of the most mustctanly pianists In Oak
land society, and Mrs. Stratton. whose beau
tiful voice we do not hear often enough, rend
ering several delightful Instrumental and vocal
number*.
Those asked to meet Mr. and Mrs. Pace
were: Mrs. Eleanor Foiger, Mr. and Mrs.
Andrew Moseley. Frederick W. Hall. Mr. and
Mrs. Thomas Prather and Mr. and Mrs. John
L. Howard.
Perhaps the wretched, wet weather Wednes
day evening dampened everybody's ardor
somewhat, but anyway the choral numbers
ot the Orpheus Club seemed to lack the gay
swing and brilliant ensemble that have been
such delightful, distinguishing features of past
concerts. Only two or three selections seemed
to win popular favor and call for an encore.
Is the Orpheus Club growing indifferent 01
was the audience lacking In appreciation? At
any rate things seemed to drag, something
very unusual at an Orpheus Club concert.
Mr.'ar.d Mrs. Fred Qutterson were heard for
the first time In Oakland since their return
from Europe. As a cellist Mr. Gutterson prob
ably has no equal on the coast, and the sympa
thetic piano accompaniment of his wife always
adds to the pleasure with which one listens to
this rarely talented couple. The violin, cello
and piano number by John Lewis, Mr. Gutter
son and Mrs. A. W. Moore was also well re
ceived and the participants were compelled to
respond to an encore.
There is one thing that must be said for the
Orpheus Clvb â they present rear artists a* soio
ists and wo have much to thank them for in
that line.
Socially, the concert was as usual a brilliant
success, society and lovers of music being out
in full force, notwithstanding the storm.
By the high standard It has ever endeavored
to maintain the Orpheus Club has attracted
and stimulated most of the male vocal talem
on this side of the bay and Is now In a most
prosperous condition. It has outgrown all
present concert hall accommodations, and the
need for an auditorium is felt more and more.
at each public entertainment. Many of the
members are in favor of erecting their own
home of music, and It would not be at all sur
prising If the end of the present year found
their dream materialized. Enthusiasm can
work miracles, and there is certainly plenty of
miracle-working stuff in the Orpheus Club.
The Clift home on San Pablo avenue was
filled with a gay crowd of young people to-day,
a large number of Mlsb Jean Cliffs friends
having been aÂ»ked to meet Miss Elizabeth Liv

from "Pinafore" will be tripping from every
body's tongue, for everybody will certainly at
tend the benefit to be given on that evening
for the little Congregational Chapel in Fruit
vale. The cast Includes many society maijs.
matrons and men, and those who have been
present at the rehearsals are prophesying a
brilliant success. Mrs. Henry Wetherbee, who
has already acquired fame as an amateur im
presario, is engineering the affair, as well as
taking an active part in the production. So
indications are that a l<val playhouse where
"Pinafore" will be presented on February 7,
will find Its space none too great.
Miss Pearl Ring is stage manager and A. S.
Hilton music director, and to their Splendid
executive ability each is adding an enthusiasm
that would never attend the efforts of high
salaried professionals.
The cast Is excellent. The choruses are good
and the soloists are unusually capable Mrs.
Mary Carpeneto Mead, who plays the part of
Josephine, is not only a beautiful woman but
has an exquisite soprano voice that will surely
call forth many an encore. Miss Gertrude
Gould promises some clever and graceful work
as Buttercup, and Sanfnrd Bennett as Plr
Joseph Porter, and Louis Jacoby as Dick
Deadeye, are very good, to Â«ay nothing of
handsome Dr. Rudolph^ who makes a fas
cinating Ralph Rackstraw. Mr. Bennett's lit
tle daughter. Marie, will take the part of the
Midshlpmite.
The regular theater orchestra will be aug
mented for "Pinafore." and everything that
will conduce to a perfect presentation ot the
popular opera will be done. About l*<v>
have already been sold for the affair, and rh.se
who have not bought their tickets had better
do so immediate.*.

I r.like the other blockade runners dis

for Kofi, Japan, the Brinkburn made
â¢cret of her destination. She

â will be commanded by Captain Morton. With

both lines will have all the business they can

Again and Lands Miyamoto
Ninety-four Chinese and Japanese j
immigrants, who arrived on the steam
ship* Korea from the Orient, are be
ing detained by United States Immi
grant Commissioner North pending
medical report as to their sanitary
condition. : Many of them are afflicted
with trachoma, a contagious disease of
the eyes.
A telegram was received yesterday
from Washington announcing that the
appeal of Kwanichi Miyamoto had
teen sustained and ordering his land
ing. This Japanese immigrant was an
employe of the Yokohama Specie Bank
of Yokohama and was on his way to
New York to take a clerical position
in the branch bank in that city. Com
missioner North, : following the rule
heretofore adopted by the Department
of Commerce and Labor, denied him a
landing as a contract laborer. |
Mrs. Kobuyo Tuitsumi. a prepossess
ing Japanese woman, 27 years old, is
also detained pending the arrival: of
her husband from Fresno. They were
married by proxy ; in Japan, the hus
band being 'represented by his : photo
graph. While such marriages ar2 legal
in Japan, and while : they are recog
nized as legal in the United States ,in
cases in which neither of the parties is
at the time of the ceremony within the
jurisdiction of the United States, the
marriage lis not demed I valid in the
present k case; ;. Mr. Tuitsumi being in
this country 'at the time the I ceremony
between i his '. bride I and his photograph |
was performed. Immigrant Commis- i
sicner North requires that the parties }
shall be married either according to
the -: Christian or . I the 'civil :â  rite when I.
the : '* bride 1 arrives ; here ; as ; a necessary .
condition Ito:; her being ; landed. The !
Japanese i Consul called ; .upon Mr. I
North yesterday to protest against this ;
procedure. g Finding Mr. North | obdu- '
rate, the Consul ' served a letter of pro- ,*
test upon i him, which ! the Commis
sioner â  will i forward Ito the Secretary .
of the 'Department of Commerce and

Will Buy Three Sweeping Machines.
The Supervisors' Btreet Committee
yesterday ordered the purchase of
three Austin sweeping: machines for
$1005, with the privilege of buying
three more at the same price. The
machines will require but two horses
instead of three for other machines
and will thus effect a saving of $2 75
per day. A saving will be made on
the rental of the machines, which has
all along been $12 per day. so the
machines will pay for themselves in a
month.

POLYGAMY IN IDAHO.
r yHK Idaho Legislators has passed an anti-polygamy measure,
on the motion of a Mormon. This is good as far as it goes,
*â  but it really touches the issue very slightly. The Idaho Mor
mons arc in a political minority, but a minority strong enough to
hold the balance of power. Their control does not extend to courts
and juries. They are outlying colonies, in a Gentile atmosphere, and
their situation denies" to them many immunities which are enjoyed
iren in Utah, the real center of the church. The Idaho
- no solution of the question. There is only one efficient
ion and that is by an amendment to the Federal constitution,
making polygamy a Federal question and putting it under such
ict ion that a trial for offense may be had anywhere within a
al court circuit.
In this way a jury can be secured that is not under any sort of
influence, exerted through social or business or political
vis. A church whose spiritual head is living now with five
- and is the father of forty-three children cannot make its
peace with the moral sentiment of the country by moving an Idaho
statute which would send its head and many of its apostles to the
penitentiary, if they were in Idaho jurisdiction. A constitutional
provision enforced by a Federal statute gives universal jurisdiction
to the Federal courts, that would apply to Idaho and Utah, Wyom
irado and Nevada. New Mexico and Arizona, all of the
m and semi-Mormon States and Territories.
When a Mormon member of Congress proposes such an amend
ment and it is ratified by a Mormon Legislature in Utah, the
country will begin to feel some confidence in Mormon professions
and manifestoes. Until then the country will refuse to accept the
nse, which consists in the Mormon kettle calling the
black. It has never been any answer, defensive of
j . that incontinence prevails in Gentile society. That is
admitted, but the offense in the Gentile world causes a moral recoil
that is not among the Mormon sensations caused by polygamy.
The country insists that an offense, everywhere else denounced by
;.\v and deprecated by society as an immorality and a felony,
cannot be transfigured into a virtue in Utah, though hallowed by
pretended revelations and sanctified into a religious obligation.
All other religious denominations recognize allegiance to civil
government. They take the statement, "Render unto Caesar the
ihihgs that are Caesar's." to mark the line between civil and re
ligious obligations, keeping them distinct and non-conflicting. But
this is not so with the Mormons. In his testimony in his own behalf
before the Senate committee, Senator Smoot admitted the possi
bility of a church command, called a revelation, in conflict with his
to the slate, and suspending all of his civil obligations, and
:hat in such case he would expatriate himself. Of course
that means that if his church ordered him to fight his country he
would become a fugitive from his country's justice and seek beyond
rs a foothold from which to strike it, at the command of his
church.
It will be seen that this admission of the Senator raises issues
that are n<>t possible in other than the Mormon communion. There
other which in its constitution and faith has the germ of
treason and possible enmity to the civil state. They are all con
tent with the conditions of religious liberty enforced by our system
and differentiate things spiritual from things temporal. A Catholic
Jodge on the bench hears cases in divorce and renders the decree
required by the law and facts, though his church does not permit
divorcement. Civil and spiritual allegiance are kept widely and
properly separated.
In the Mormon church they are merged and spiritual alle
giance is made paramount. Where Mormons are in a political
majority the State is transformed into a theocracy. These are the
deep stated issues made by the attitude of the church. They are
not met effectually by occasional State cognizance and jurisdiction.
If the elements of superstition and fanaticism were less necessary
to the Mormon cult, the leaders of the church should be glad to
put themselves on a loyal equality with the other churches. Much
of their doctrine is acceptable to the moral sense of the country,
no matter what the people may think of the fantastic claims of the
supernatural in the proceedings of Joseph Smith.
He established his movement in a time of emotion and impulse,
when t he minds of men were moved upon by marvels and wonders,
and human credulity was out hunting for the mystic and unaccount
able. If the system, however, can do any good among men, no
reasonable person objects. But the country insists that it shall
strip itself of immorality and disloyalty, and shall in good faith
observe the proper American distinction between state and church.
The burden of proof of Americanism rests upon the Mormon lead
ers. The country waits for its presentation in patience and watch
fulness. How long will it wait?
It is partly for the Mormons to say. One thing is sure* it
will not wait until the church has grasped political power in
enough States to prevent the issue being made a Federal concern.
The first Republican platform denounced the "Twin relics of bar
barism, slavery and polygamy." One twin was killed by an amend
ment to the constitution of the United States. The other lives and
is dodging a blow from the same club.
THE SUNDAY CALL MAGAZINE.
TO-MORROW in The Sunday Call Magazine will appear the
last installment of "The Brethren," H. Rider Haggard's ro
mance of the Crusades. On February 12 will appear the first
installment of the great English literary sensation of the day, a
posthumous unfinished novel by the late Benjamin Disraeli, Earl
of Beaconsfield. This novel, which is given just as the great Eng
lish statesman-author left it, is published in two installments. Con
cerning it the London Times says: "This work is the last which
came from the pen of the great statesman, who was engaged upon
it immediately prior to his death. Like 'Coningsby,' it is a novel
of the day. His contemporaries and the social and political condi
tions of thirty years ago furnish the framework of the story. A pecu
liar fascination is exercised by literary fragments. * * * He wrote
of his day, of the figures political and social that moved about him.
"What had he to say of them as he viewed them from his last days,
and to what conclusion would he have brought his story? To these
questions a complete answer can never be given, but to that por
tion of his novel finished ere the pen fell from his hand we may
]<>ok for at least a partial reply."
"The King of the Crooked H," by Anna Ballard Reeves, a
sympathetic study of cowboy life and character, is the prize fiction
story for the week. In "The Sealer," Stewart Edward White con
tributes one of his strong stories of the Maine lumbermen. Other
features of interest will be "Jottings of Old Lim Jncklin," by Opie
Read, in which the country store philosopher delivers himself of
some pungent reflections on "Horse Sense" ; "On and Off the Bread
Wagon," by Charles Dryden, in which the itinerant iron molder
gets amusing in his recitals of the trials of crossing the plains in
the early days; "Adventures of Chimmie Fadden," wherein the
Bowery philosopher makes useful discoveries as to logic ; "Fables for
the Foolish," by Nicholas Nemo; "The Matrimonial Handicap," by
Kate Thyson Marr; a page by Madge Moore, "Pretty Trifles for
Evening Wear." and answers .to correspondents; the regular book
review department handled by Robert W. Ritchie, and, in addition
to many smaller articles of interest, the puzzle page for the children.

IN THE HALL OF FAME AND FUN
THOMAS W. LAWSON IN A FINE FRENZY, AND J. PIERPONT
ENTER: A WINE-COLORED GOWN
THE train was thirty minutes <
from Padmore when Miss Rand
sat up straight and began pull- i
ing the pins out of her hat, a
pretty wine-colored affair that exactly j
matched her traveling gown. Five
minutes later in a tan rain coat and
cap she splashed down into the pools
of water on the open platform of the
railway station and faced the glaring
eyes of the hansom cabs, transfer
wagons and a private brougham or two
lined up opposite. She paused under
a lamp midway of the line and looked
expectant.
Only a brougham and a cab re
mained when Miss Hand gathered up
her skirts and started down the plat
form. A coachman in green livery
was guiding a young woman in a wine
colored gown to the brougham. Miss
Rand was hurrying toward the coach
man when a voice drawling from the
cab at her right made her stop short.
"Hello, Kate," it said. "What in
time are you doing here?"
"Well, Tommy Yates!" she laughed,
offering her hand. "Isn't this funny?"
"'Yes, isn't it?" he said, holding fast
to the hand. "Don't you know enough
to come in out of the rain?"
The next moment she was settling
herself on the dry cushions.
"I've been standing out there hours
waiting for some one to claim me,"
she said as the door banged shut and
the cab started off. "And you sitting
here all the time. Cruel! What were
i you doing anyway?"
"Looking for a girl very much like
you." Tommy turned and gazed at
her. The damp air had made little
blonde ringlets about her face. "You
are just as pretty as ever, Kate." He
leaned over and looked closer. "Yes,
even prettier," he added.
"Nonsense!" she said, blushing as
the cab passed under an arc light.
."You are just as silly as ever, Tommy;
you'll never get over that."
"What?" asked Tommy shortly.
"Silliness."
"I thought I had," said Tommy
j shortly. "But somehow I think I
1 never will, either." Something in his
I vcice made her turn and look at him.
"I am going to Brettons," she said,
â  alter a silence. "I think it is 538
Grant. If the coachman did get
the wrong girl I couldn't stand out in
the rain another minute. You see, I
was to be identified by my wine
colored dress, but it rained so hard I
put on this coat. I wasn't going to
have the gown spoiled."
"Ah-h!" Tommy actually hugged
himself. He had the cabby stop at
Martin's. "How long has it been
since I saw you, K^ate?"
"You have forgotten?"
"No. I Just wanted to see if you
remembered. Four years since you
Jilted me."
The cab had stopped and Tommy
was out in the streaming light of the
i cafe, ready to assist her. She sank
| back on the seat. #
"Oh, oh!" she protested. "I forgot
I was to be at the Brettons for dinner.
j They'll be expecting me."
"Oh, pshaw! Here I was delegated
to look after a girl in a wine-colored
frock, and now she disapproves of my
I scheme of entertainment."
"Oh," sad Kate, climbing out, "la
that it? I thought you were simply
! a convenience."
"Now see here," Tommy tucked her
I under the umbrella, "I'm not a kid
any more. I'm assistant cashier of
, the bank."

"Going? What do you mean? Please

"But, you see, it is this way," she
expostulated. "I don't know the Bret

"He's a nice sort," commented
Tommy.

"And how about the friend?"
"Well," Tommy looked at his watch,
"she has an hour and a half the start
of you."
"So this is your little game," she
cried. "Do you think for a minute,
Tommy Yates, that I'm going to let
another girl do me out? No, sir. He's

"I couldn't really believe my eyes

"You came down to get that girl in !

"So I did." Tommy was staring hard
at her wine-colored blouse. "I got her."
Kate pushed back her plate, clasped
her hands on the table and looked at
him.
"Explain yourself," she said.

"And you sat there, high and dry,

Tommy pulled out a box of cigarettes
and nourished it "With your permis- !

swer him. He lighted one regardless.
"I decided one minute after the train ;
pulled In that I wasn't going to marry
her after all."
"And you ran back and hid your head ;
in the cab to prevent her seeing you, 1

"I didn't get out."
"Baby! You were afraid you would
get your feet wet!"
Tommy blew a wreath of smoke over
the carafe.
"I was trying to figure how I was to
get you into the cab and keep her out."
"Tommy!" Kate's eyes had widened.
"Did you love that girl?"
Tommy shook his head.
"Then why did you ever think of
marrying her?"
Tommy made an inventory of the
pretty girl before him; pink and white,
blue, gold â cheeks, eyes, hair.
"She looked like you," he said shortly.
"Tommy, you don't care yet."
"Yes, I do."
"But you were so mean to the other
girl."
"She won't care. She likes money. I

DEPEW MAY BE JOLLY KING DA-UDU OF OLD.
Editor The Call: On page 8 of The
Call of February 2 there was printed a
cut of the world's oldest statue, and
which had recently been unearthed.
The statue bears a remarkable re
semblance to Senator Chauncey M. De
pew while in a humorous and satisfied
state of mind. Dr. E. J. Banks of the
University of Chicago now at Bagdad
says that It is the/ effigy of King Da-
Udu, King of the Babylonian city of
Bismyra, and who reigned 2000 yea/3
ago.
The discovery of this very old statue,
and the fact that it fs a close likeness
of Senator Depew, should be seised upcm
by Theosophists-Buddhists, and those
who believe Mn the theory of reincarna
tion as a probable proof of the exist
ence of such a natural law as pre-ex
istence. They claim that when we cast
off the physical body at death we enter
into a state of rest called Nirvana, the

HAVE A BOOM
Large Project to Get Gold
From American River.
Plans of the Mountain Copper Company Relat
ing to Keswick Reassure Shasta People.
The mines of Sierra County bid fair 1
to come more strongly to the front dur
ing; the coming: season than for many
years. Such are the authentic reports
that come down from those parts of the ;
county where mining: operations are
carried on. At Forest City the Mabel
Mertz mine is to be fully developed.
The company owning: the property has
COOO feet of channel, supposed to be the '
continuation of an old lead.
Work was carried on at the placer
mines at Goodyear Bar as long as the 1
weather would permit and until the '
deep snowScame. Pumping machinery
has been put in place to take the su- t
perfluous water from- the Dolly Varden
property, one of the oldest in the coun- I
ty. The miners all report good hopes
for the immediate future, which devel- i
opments would seem to warrant. 1
As usual, there are problems to be '
solved by the miners in their own way. *
In an ancient river bed, for instance,
it has been determined where a tunnel j
has been run that the channel Is ab- 1
normally wide, and although several
rich spots have been found in which
r.uggets worth from 590 to 1100 each 1
have been discovered, drifts must be i
run to find the richest portion.
Concerning a river mining proposi
tion which may result in the working
of a stretch of the American River bed
the Placervllle Nugget says:
The River Consolidated Mining Company, !
incorporated a few years ago in this city, has '
a proposition under way which may result in
the working out of a considerable stretch ot I
ttaf American River a short distance from this ,
city. The company has a string of claim* '
-aung SOOO feet, or nearly two miles, ;
located on the American River between the ;
dam of the electric company at Rock Creek I
anj the i>ower-house.
The crevices in the bed of the American I
Kiver have been found to be rich in gold 1
where it has been found possible to work them I
out and the tributary creeks at this point have
yielded gold. The rocky river bed Is not a',
suitable p>ace to operate a dredger, but It Is
claimed that a cheaper and better method can j
b? employed during the summer months. The
electric company takes 9000 inches 01 water '
from the river at Rock Creek and in the dry j
tnocths the water going over the spillway <
average* about 1000 inches. By building a
f.ume to handle this water and furnish power
the entire stretch of river bed could be !
cleaned up. Some work will be done on the I
property frpra time to time by the owners.

OPERATIONS AT Kl>\\lCK.
The Mountain Copper Company will
continue to operate the large smelting
plant at Keswick, Shasta County. One
furnace will be used continuously and
the other will be kept in reserve. None
of the water Jackets" will be removed
to Martinet, for the reason that at
Martinez the reverberatory furnaces
will be employed. A Redding paper says:
The force at the Keswick plant has been
materially lessened during the laÂ« lew months
but the number now employed v. 11l not be ma
terially reduced. The fire In the Iron Moun
tain mine, which hae caused considerable trouble
for teveral years past, prevent* the production i
of ore on such a large scale as in the early '
history of The property. Mining is restricted
because of the fire.
During tie last two years the smelter has
drawn upon large bedies of ore that had been
ir.tned and stored on the eld roaster grounds.
This has now all been smelted. The stocks
are exhausted, nd only the mine is left to I
draw upon. There is not much hope that two
furnacts will ever be run again at Keswick.
One will be kept running continuously.
The Martinez plant is designed to prepare
the way for utilizing ore in the Hornet mine.
Tbis is a mine adjoining the Iron Mountain.
It has a larger body of ore than that found in
' rhe famous Iron Mountain, but it is of lower
grade ar.d must be worked on a different basis. j
The operations at Keswick will, in view of ;
. the ehortage of the ore supply from the Iron â 
Mountain, be very much diminished from what j
. they lave been in the past. The" three railroad j
crewÂ» now running between Iron Mountain
and Keswick will be continued, and 300 men
will be constantly employed at the company's
Keswick and Iron Mountain property. The 1
elatement above i* from headquarters and is !
authentic. Keswick people and those of Shasta I
County at large can depend upon it that these
are the conditions that will be found here and
at Iron Mountain hereafter.

POSTUM CEREAL.
A REAR ADMIRAL
IÂ»f the Navy Gives Some Points on
Coffee.
A naval officer of all men has a
chance to become an expert on coffee
when he talks about it, naturally
â *c somewhat of hiÂ« subject.
A certain famous (now retired) rear
.ral whoee name can be given by
. on request, says:
"I have traveled thig wide world,
over from the Arctic to the Antarctic-
have drunk, the best coffees ever
n on thi6 coatinent or in the East,
- by the best chefs, and am an
â¢>]>fcrt coffee maker myself.
"Of late I noticed that there was
â thing wrong in my dietary and
that I was suffering from dizziness im-
mediately after my coffee. I was be-
coming sadly constipated, something
unusual for me. 1 was averse to
thinking that coffee was giving me so
much inconvenience, but I thought
j'erhaps it would be best to reduce its
strength, but it made no perceptible
change in my feelings.
"At last I thought I would venture
to try Postum Food Coffee, a prepara-
tion that I often laughed at, as I read
It* advertisements, so I purchased a
emaJl package and followed the direc-
<ions explicitly and prepared my first
< up. I was surprised to find that so
far as taste was concerned it was all
right! Besides it had a satisfactory
tee ling. The next morning 1 found
that my bowels were moved normal-
â  d ac in days when I was younger
Â»n the prime of life. Xext thing
I noticed that when I sat down to my
morning paper and later to my mail
that my head -and mind were much
< learer than they had been for a long
and I had no feeling oi depres-
and lassitude. No one could
made me believe that a change
from coffee to so simple a liquid food
( ould have produced such a rapid and
marked change in a person's condi-
tion.- It is now about three months
< I began to use Postum. I have
r hankered after coffee, do not
want to see it, for I am In excellent
â¢nditlon, no constipation, no indiges-
tion, no dizziness, no dullness and in
fact feel like a new man, and I at-
tribute It to the change wholly and I
may say that I feel stronger than I
/lid three months ago and at my age,
7C, strength Is a much needed thing,
in short, since I abandoned coffee I,
am better natured, better conditioned
and better pleased than I have been
for a long time. The experiment I
made with Poetum cost me 15 cents,
the < beneficial results obtained cannot
be calculated in dollars and cents. It
takes a little more time to make Pos-
tum Coffee than ordinary- coffee, but
I count the difference in time as
naught In comparison with the bene-
fit* gained. I think I â hall try Grape*
Nuu next"
last payment has been made on the
Enterprise mine, near Weaverville, and
that the purchase price was about
$40,000. Work will be resumed on a
larger scale than heretofore. The
property has been run under a bond
for about a year for E. M. Woodin of
Boston. The mine was located in ISB3.
The sale of the Enterprise mine, so
says the Searchlight, is good news for
Trinity County, for it implies the em
ployment of more men in the East
Fork district, and a general revival of
quartz mining in that remote part of
Trinity County.
Mining activity at Grub Gulch, so
says the Gazette Mariposan, is on the
increase. Several properties will be
operated soon In that section. Los An
peles people have bought the Tiger
mine and have taken a bond on the
Searchlight. It is also reported that
the same parties have purchased the
Mammoth electric power plant. Pros
pecting is proceeding at the Savannah
mine, which is owned by L. A. Sharp
of San Francisco. Work will soon be
gin at the Gambetta property. Nego
tiations are in progress to reopen the
Lucky Bill, owned by R. A. Prouty of
Mariposa and S. W. Westfall of Ma
dera. The same authority says:
There has not been so much powder ueed
for years on the Bull Creek and North Fork
mines as there Is to-day. And several more
mining men are coming here looking for mines
At the Dana mine Harry Soderbery Is running
the mill on good rock James Harris has lo
cated the old Pine Hill mine and is busy
taking out ore. Reynolds and HUllard are
opening np a. fine prospect. The Contention
mine and mill have resumed operations. Thomas
Twaddle is on Bull Creek where he has a
good mine. At the Puzzler. Patterson and
Kinsley are getting a mill in position.
IX OTHER COUNTIES.
The Jackson Ledger says that the
Mitchell mine near Pine Grove, Ama
dor County, will be operated again.
The title has been perfected by the
present owners.
George F. Bartlett has come into
possession of the Mayflower, Red Haw,
Lena Bell and other properties near
Carters. They were sold at Sheriff's
sale. The former ownej was the Man
zanita Mining Company. The Rain
bow, Iron Tross and Mount Key mines,
near the South Fork of the Stanislaus
River, have been acquired by a Colo
rado Company.
The Ashland Tidings says gold has
1 been discovered about two miles south
i of the Ashland mine on the mountain
I elope opposite Panther Butte. The
j ledge runs nearly east and west- The
j property ; s owned by D. B. Grant of
; Shasta County.
More than the usual number of mmâ 
â  ing locations were filed in January in
the various mining districts of Cali
fornia. Some of the interior papers
published in the mountainous regions
i have printed lists of locators md loca
1 tions numbering hundreds < acl .
The Trinity Journal reports that
with the exception of the Yellow Rose
1 and Dorleska properties all the mines
in Northern Trinity County have been
shut down for some time owing- to the
depth of the snow-. The Yellow Rose is
running a tunnel 1200 feet long on the
lower level. All surface work on the
Dorleska was suspended some weeks
ago, but a drift has been run south
from the bottom of the winze in ore.
The Journal also makes this com
plaint:
One of the most discouraging elements with
which the prospector and miner in Northern
California have to contend is the present status
of the railroad lands located in the mineral
districts. At the present time the majority of
lands are not for sale, and those thai
are on the market are quoted at euch fancy
figures as to put them beyond the reach of
the avprare miner. The fact of those lands
being taken off the market is a great draw
back to the development of the mining in
dustry of California. It not only retards the
development of the mineral and timber sections
in the railroad grant, but it also affects the
alternate sections of Government land, as pros
pectors do not care to take chances In losing
a season's work spent In a mining district
In which one-half the land Is not for sale and
the other half practically unsurveyed.
WORK IX THE NORTH.
The Yreka Journal reports that forty
five men are working night and day at
the Morrison & Carlock quartz mine, in
Quartz Valley, with very good success.
'A force of miners has been put to work
on the McKinley quartz mine, at Hum
bug. An assessment has been levied by
the directors of the Patterson Creek
Gold Mining Company preparatory to
; resuming operations in the spring. The
! Seattle gravel claim, in the Elliott
Creek district, on Siskiyou Mountain,
at the head of Applegate, on the Ore
gon boundary, will be again worked.
On the lower Klamath an abundance of
water has made the miners of the
Happy Camp section busy.
A demonstration of the remarkable
gem resources of San Diego County is
made by a collection that has just been
put on exhibition in the museum of the
California State Mining Bureau in the
ferry building in this city. The gems
are from Mesa Grande. The collection
is the property of Ernest Schernikow of
New York. It was lent to the State
Mining Bureau at the request of Miner
alopiPt Aubury. The stones are tour
malines, among the most interesting
gems ever discovered.
The tourmaline has many peculiari
ties. It was originally found in the
East Indies by the early navigators
and explorers. One of its strange prop
erties then noticed was its power of at
traction, which was thought to be elec
trical, for ashes, straw, paper and other
materials were drawn to it, especially
when exposed to the rays of the sun.
The hardness of the tourmaline com
pares with that of the emerald. The
gem has great brilliancy.
From a scientific point of view it is
explained that this remarkable gem
belongs to rocks of crystallization and
does not appear in the secondary ter
ralnes, or rocks of transition. Like the
sapphire, it has a variety of names and
synonj-ms, as well as diversity of col
ors. One expert says the monster red
gem which hangs as a pendant to the
jade necklace which belonged to the
ChineFe Emperor and was captured by
the French in the sacking of Peking
might prove to be a, tourmaline.
Mineralogist Aubury is endeavoring
to get the collection permanently for
the State, to be displayed in some pub
lic institution.
Federal Indictments.
The United States Grand Jury made
a preliminary report yesterday and
returned the following indictments:
John Russell, for making a mold for
the coining of counterfeit dollar
pieces; Charles Cohn. for embezzling

All Matches in Which Occi

Are Entirely Canceled
Three games of association football
will be played to-morrow in this vicin
ity, two of them being for the 1904-1905
championship of the California Asso
ciation Football League, and the third
a friendly contest between the Inde- ,
pendents and the Albion Rovers. The j
game between the Eagles and Occi
dentals that was set down on the
schedule has been canceled, the Occi
dentals having withdrawn from the
league. The opportunity has been taken |
to play the match between the Eagles i
and Pickwicks which was postponed
from Sunday, January 22, on account
of the wet condition of the Alameda j
ground on that day. The match will {
take place to-morrow on the ground at j
Webster street,' Alameda, J. Cameron ;
being the referee.
At Idora Park the Oakland Hornets
meet the Vampires, J. Frew being the
referee. At Freeman's Park, Golden j
Gate, the Independents will meet the j
Albion Rovers in a friendly match, C. !
W. Irish acting as referee.
All three games should prove interest- â¢
ing and well contested, as the teams are
well matched in point of strength. The j
Independents and Albion Rovers stand
at the head of the table of results for
the championship, while the Pickwicks
and Eagles are at the foot. The Vam
pires and Hornets occupy a midway po- â 
eition, the latter having less points to 1
their credit than the former, but have
played only five matches, while the
Vampires have played eight league j
games.
The Occidental Club having with- >
drawn from the California Association
Football League, the nine matches
played by the Occidental team have
been wiped out of consideration alto- J
gether, the goals made by or against
the eleven counting for nothing. A re- i
construction of the table of results for
the league championship has thus been
rendered necessary. The only match
lost by the Independents having been
the opening one of the season against
the Occidentals, the Independent team I
has a straight score, having played |
eight matches and won eight. The ta
ble as it stands now is given below:

When the resignation of the Occi
dental Club from the league came up
before the managers of that body It
'wdk accepted promptly and unanimous
ly. The league secretary was instructed |
to demand payment of the fines due by \
the club. Though the Occidentals have
asserted that they did not receive fair
treatment from the managers and ref
erees of the league, they were unable to
state any details or specific instances.
Only on one occasion did they enter
any objection to a decision of Arthur
Robinson, who is regarded as the most
competent referee in the State and as
quite impartial. He is, however, quick
to detect foul or tricky play and to Im
pose a severe penalty therefor. None
of the men who played during the pres
ent season in the Occidental eleven will
be permitted to take part in the ties
for the California Association Football
Union cup, which will begin as soon as
the. schedule for the league champion
ship Is played out. The Occidental elev
en started with a rush at the begin
ning of the season, winning in succes
sion from the Independents, the Albion
Hovers and the Pickwicks. They de
veloped a habit of alluding to them
felves as the "champion team" and the
'â¢foremost association football club in
San Francisco." After postponing two
matches' 1 they were beaten on Decem
,hcr 4 by the Oakland Hornets, and from
that time never won a match. The best
they could do was to play a tie with
the Eagles, who have never beaten any '
team or tied with any but the Occi
dentals. They became disgruntled and
began to abuse the referees and com
plain that, though they had rendered
more valuable services to the game
than any other club, they received no
favors from the managers >of the
league. They have issued a challenge
to play the Independents or the Hor
nets a, match for $100 a.. side, though
they know, well that neither of these, aa
amateur teams, can accept their chal
lenge. They announce their Intention
of taking up the Gaelic game and will
play in the coming Gaelic tournament.

GOLFERS RESUME
INTERCLUB TESTS
Home - and - Home Tourney Fixed
Th^re are evidences of increasing ac
tivity among the golfers of San Fran
cisco and neighborhood. On Tuesday
morning, the 7th inst., the ladies of the
San Francisco Golf and Country Club
will take part in the qualifying round,
over eighteen holes, medal play, of the
second competition held during the
present season for the Council's cup for
women. That is to say, they will do so
if they follow the schedule of events for
the women's annex exactly. It is. how
ever, much more likely that they will
dispense with the qualifying round,
which will be rendered unnecessary by
the fact of not more than eight ladies
wishing to enter the competition.
There being no need of eliminating
any surplus competitors, the opening
round of match play will be held on
Tuesday. On Wednesday the semi-final
round will be played, and on Thursday
the final round. As both Mrs. J. R.
Clark and Mrs. W. G. Miller have two
victories to their credit, if either of
them should prove a winner in next
week's competition the handsome silver
trophy, which is a three-time challenge
cup, will become her property. The
trophy bears the names of Mrs." R. Gil
man Brown (once), Mrs. W. G. Miller
(twice). Mrs. J. R. Clark (twice) and
Miss Alice Hager (once).
The ladies also have another trophy
in eight. Mrs. I.eroy Nickel has offered
a silver cup shaped like a long-stemmed
( hampagne glass for competition in a
handicap.
ATJTOISTS ACTIVE
Club Carries Test Case to Supreme Court
There is pending before the Su
preme Court of the State of Califor
nia a case in which automobilists are
greatly interested. In July of last
year a San Francisco business man
named T. C. Berry, who lives In Ma
rin County, was driving his motor car
on an open road in the county after
9 o'clock at night and was arrested
under thÂ« provision of the county or
dinance, which prohibits the operation
of automobiles between sunset of one
day and sunrise of the next. He was
fined $25 by the Justice of the Peace
and on appeal to the Superior Court
the decision was affirmed.
The matter has been brought be
fore the Supreme Court and will be
submitted on briefs. The Automobile
Club of California believes the county
has no power to make such an ordi
nance, its provisions being unconstitu
tional and directed against a partic
ular class of the community. The
club wishes to deter other counties
from passing similar ordinances,
which would seriously affect the
pleasure of motori.g. The Marin
County ordinance also prohibits the
operation of automobiles on certain
roads within the limits of its jurisdic
tion altogether. If the Automobile
Club defeats the "sunset and sunrise"
provision it will proceed to test the
validity of other sections of the or
dinance.* Warren Gregory has charge
of the case for the club. *
C. C. Moore, a member of the ex
ecutive committee of the Automobile
Club of California, is trying to have
the mountain road between San Jose
and Santa Cruz opened for the use of
motorists. Both Santa Cruz and San
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY. FEBRUARY 4. 1905
Arrangements have been made for
the resumption of the matches between
teams representing the golf clubs of
San Francisco and Oakland. These
have lapsed for some time on account
of the poor condition in which the Pre
sidio course was and of the loss of the
Adams Point course by the Oaklanders.
Now. however, the interclub contests,
which always excited great interest,
will take place again. A team of twelve
men representing the Clarcmont Coun
try Club will visit the Presidio course
on Saturday, the 11th inst., to meet an
equal number of members of the San
Francisco Golf and Country Club in the
first half of a thirty-six-hole home-and
home match. The second eighteen holes
of the first match will be played on the
course of the Claremont Country Club
in Rockrldge Park on Saturday, the
18th inst. Dr. J. R. Clark will captain
the San Francisco team and W. P.
Johnson will perform the same office for
the Claremont twelve.
A second thirty-six-hole match will
be played later in the season, and if the
same club wins both contests the tour
nament will be ended and the interclub
trophy won. If, however, each club
wins one thirty-six-hole match a tie
will result, which will be decided by a
third match, probably of eighteen
holes, on neutral links.
In former interclub team matches
each club has been represented by eight
men, but the number of players has
been increased in order to permit more
golfers to be taken into the teams and
to increase the general interest.
ta Clara counties had ordinances pro
hibiting the use of the road, but as
the Santa Cruz authorities have con
sented to throw the road on their side
of the range open, it is hoped the San
ta Clara Supervisors will consent to
do the same for their side. The dis
tance between San Jose and Santa
Cruz by way of Gilroy and Watson
ville is eighty miles, whereas it is
only thirty miles by the mountain
road. When the prohibition was made
many motor car owners were careless
of the rights of others and horses
were little used to automobiles. Now,
however, horses have overcome their
fear of motor cars to a large extent
and the operators of automobiles have
learned to be more considerate. It is
not so common to drive automobiles
at a dangerous rate of speed as it was
on their first introduction.
The Automobile Club is still grow
ing, more than sixty new members
having been added to its roll at the
last meeting. Many of the new mem
bers are not owners of motor cars,
but join the club because of the work
it is doing in securing good roads. This
work is of value to all who use the
roads, whether cyclists, drivers of
horses and other animals, pedestrians
or motorists.
The dinner of the members of
the Automobile Club of California will
be held on Saturday, the 18th inst. It
will be made an annual event.
CHAN CHEUNG DECISION POSTPONED.
The case of Chan Cheung-, charged with the
murder of Tom Tick of the Chinese Educa
tional Society was on Judgr^ Lawlor's calen
dar yesterday for the defendant to plead. As
tho Judge was not yet ready to decide the mo
tion to vacate the Indictment, a continuance
was ordered till February 11.
HORSES AND JOCKEYS WHICH
ARE EXPECTED TO PLAY PROM
INENT PARTS IN HANDICAP.
NOTED JOCKEYS
IN THE SADDLE
Hiding Talent at Oakland
Will Be Able to Do Full
Justice to Stake Horses
The fates are again unkind to the New
California Jockey Club in the matter of
weather and the eleventh renewal of the
Burns Handicap at Emeryville will be
decided over a race course deep with
mud. The officials have shifted the
date several times for this, the richest
event erf the winter season of racing,
but to no avail, inclement weather
being the invariable accompaniment of
this classic of the California turf.
The track conditions naturally in
crease the chances of such stout-heart
ed horses as Claude and Elliott which
will sport the Daly colcrrs, while they
reduce the chances of Dainty, Hora
tius, Ananias and other horses which
are at their best on a fast track.
The Daly pair will be the public
choice and if experience counts for
anything Claude, the great bay son
of Lissak, should be returned the win
ner. Away back in 1894, when the race
was run for the first time at the Bay
District track under the title of the
Spreckels Handicap.Lissak, then a two
year-old, and carrying 106 pounds, won.
In 1903 Claude with an impost of 96
pounds finished third. In 1904 he had
gained in favor with the handicapper
and was allotted 122 pounds. This time
he finished in second place. He will
carry 137 pounds to-day and at his rate
of progression should land in first
place. The heaviest weighted winner
o-f the Burns was Satsuma in 1898, when
he carried 122 pounds. The lightest
weighted winner was Imperious, which
carried 96 pounds.
One of the promising candidates for
the race will be Jimmy McLaughlinJp
Pasadena, which will have the serv
ices of Fuller as pilot. Walter Jen
nings will depend much on Rockaway,
which has done well in his preparatory
work.
The winner this year must score on
pure ability to run, as under the new
rule the minimum weight is 105 pounds.
This gives a good horse a chance as it
precludes the possibility of a selling
plater with a "feather" up, carrying off
the long end of the purse. The work of
Handicapper Egbert has given general
satisfaction and there will be some
mighty figuring on weights, jockeys,
mud and other conditions in an effort
to land on the ultimate winner.
There are enough good jockeys on
hand to go around so that both the
owners and the bettors should get a
ride which will satisfy them.
TO PARK DOLORES STREET.â The Board
of Works yesterday asked the Supervisors for
authority to enter into a contract for the
parking of Dolores street from Fifteenth to
Seventeenth. The sum of $5000 has been set
aside for the improvement as per plans of the
California Outdoor Art League.
PONIES TO RACE
AT INGLESIDE.
Exciting Sport Is Promised on
Washington's Birthday.
Ingleside racecourse will be gay with
life and color on Washington's birth
day, when the California Polo and Pony
Racing Association will give a day's
sport. Two worthy institutions, the
Armitage Orphange and the Women's
Hospital, will be the beneficiaries of the
affair.
This will be the first meet of the as
sociation held on a track near this city,
and it is expected a large assemblage
will be present to witness the exciting
sport furnished by. the miniature thor
oughbreds. The feature of the day will
be the two-mile steeplechase over the
stiff jumps through the field. This will
be open to all horses which have been
hunted with the San Mateo draj,
hounds. As there are a number of
splendid hunters owned by sportsmen
of this city and of San Mateo a strong
field is expected to start.
There will also be five races on the
fiat, i-anglng from a three-sixteenth
mile dash to one at a distance of one
HARES FROM IDAHO
TO BE COURSED HERE
NO FURTHER INTERRUPTION EXPECTED
The hares from Idaho and those from
Oregon will be severely tried out at the
two coursing parks to-morrow by the
California greyhounds. The Idaho
hares have much longer fur than those
from the warm climate of the San
Joaquin Valley and there is much
curiosity as to the shoeing they will
make. In moving about the field they
do not seem to have th'j extreme speed
of the California hares, but they seem
more tricky in dodging about.
Both parks having a plentiful supply
of hares in sight they will continue in
dependently of one another. As there
are many more dogs in training than
can be accommodated the parks can
pick over the entries and run the best
of those offered. This will raise the
class noticiably.
J. Walker has bought Tom King
winner of the John Grace Cup, from H
Waddington. He also bought Galves
ton. Both are by Rock Island King-
Irma and have won repeatedly.
The present intention of the officials
having in charge the running of the
Belle Brandon Cup is to have that
event decided on the last Sunday in
this month. The unsettled conditions
In coursing have put the trainers be
hind in conditioning their candidates
and they want all the time possible
There will be no stakes in which the
young dogs can be tried, but owing to
the big supply of hares now available
they can have all the private trials they
desire.
The Â«ard at Union 1- to-morrow
will be made up of a class and a re
serve stake. The quality of the grey
hounds is above the average in both
events. The likely winners look to be:

TENNIS EXPERTS
ARE PRACTICING
Championship of Alameda
County Is Expected tÂ»>
Prove Exciting Event
PLAY OX PAEK COURTS
Two Tournaments Will Bh
Completed To-Day by the
Ladies and the Juveniles
The principal tennis tournament
scheduled for February is ihe annual
singles event for the championship of
Alameda County. This tournament
will be played as usual on the Z.
Alameda, The event will be held
jointly by the various clubs of. Ala
meda County. The present champion
is George Baker of the Golden I
Club. The latter beat Percy Murdock
of Alameda in the finals last year.
Coast Champion MacGavin also par
ticipated in the tournament, but was
in poor form and lost to Variel, a man
whom he outclassed.
Murdock, in his best form, is easily
the cleverest player in the tourna
ment. Last year he played his best
early in his match with Baker, but
fell down toward the end. Baker is
a steady player, who is always in
practice. Murdock does moat of his"
playing in summer and consequently
is not at his best at this time of the
year. It is safe to say the champion
ship lies between these two experts.
Aside from Baker and Murdock the
players who stand a chance to win are
George Janes. Herbert Long. Clarence
Griffin. Charles Foley and Melville
LÂ»ong. Of these players Janes is prob
ably the best. He hardly did himself
justice at the park last Sunday, when
he lost to Brabant. His defeat was
the best thing that could have hap
pened to him and from now on he
should improve steadily. If Murdock
or Baker lose to an outsider it will
probably be Janes.
Herbert Long has been standing
still of late, but in the last two weeks
he has improved considerably. He
will undoubtedly make a first class
player and is liable to cause a surprise
at any time.
Of the younger players Melville
Long is the most promising. He has
improved wonderfully in the last
month and by next September should
be near the top. In the tournament at
the park he was placed "3-fc" below
scratch. This is not justified by any
form he has shown on the public
courts, where heretofore he has al
ways been above scratch. Despite the
handicap Long will prove hard to
beat.
Griffin and Foley are the most
promising young players at the park.
Although Foley beat Griffin m
straight sets the latter is considered by
his clubmates the stronger player. The
two are about evenly matched, with
the difference slightly in Griffins fa
vor.
Another youngster who has a bright
future on the courts is Harold Gabriel.
He is the youngest player of the lot,
but is by no means the least clever.
He plays a fast game, but is inclined
to be wild. When he grows a few
inches and steadies down he will be ct
top notcher.
After several postponements th*
handicap singles tournament was
started on the park courts last Sun
day. There were an unusual number
of defaults and also a few surprises.
Chief of the latter were the defeats
of Janes, Neil Baker and Clarence
Griffin.
The first round with the exception
of one match and about half of th-Â»
second round have been completed.
The men who have reached the third
round are George Baker. Howell.
Marius Hotchkiss, G. L. Hall. A. Bra
bant. A. McFarland and C. Teller.
The following second round matches
have not been played: Vensam vs.
Gayness, H. Long vs. Miller. Single
ton vs. Roche. Sobey vs. J. Baker or
Marvin, Palmer vs. Howell. M. Long
vs. Jewell, Lemon vs. Turner. Gabriel
vs. Morton, and Sayre vs. Lozano.
George Baker, the most heavily
handicapped player, looks to have the
best chance to win. If he meets with
trouble in his half it will be with th*
Long brothers. Both have a chant
to beat the park champion.
In the lower ha'.f the most '
candidates are Harold Gabriel. M
us " Hotchkiss and A. Brabant. The
last two named are evenly matche-i
and play from the same mark. Ga
briel will receive a slight handicap
from them and stands an excellent
chance to reach the finals. Morum is
a new man. who is on the same mark
as Brabant and Hotchkiss. He may
upset calculations.
Two tournaments will be finished on
the park courts to-day. In each there
Is an unfinished semi-final match.
These and the finals will be played.
One tournament is a ladies' hand
singles and the other a boys' handicap
doubles.

WILL NOT LEND
ITS ANTELOPES
The Board of Park Commissioners
met at the Palace Hotel yesterday aft
ernoon, President A. B. Spreckels pre
siding. Commissioners Dingee, Cum
mings and Metson and Superintendent
John McLaren attended the session.
The board denied the request of the
Pacific Coast Forest and Game Asso
ciation for a loan of antelopes. The
Commissioners decided In favor of lend
ing elk and black-tailed deer for the
proposed exhibition in the Mechanics'
Pavilion, but were not willing- that the
antelope should leave the paddock In
Golden Gate Park.
Superintendent McLaren was author
ized to construct a double wire fence
in the bear den at the park in order to
protect the cubs from the wrath or
carelessness of the old grizzly. There
will be a space of five feet between the
interior lines of wire fencing.
The superintendent reported progress
of work on the new athletic field. A
check for $250 was received from the
Academic Athletic League of Oakland.
President Spreckels reported the de
posit of $20,250 in the Central Trust
Company. Â«Â»
The superintendent announced that
he was planting a hedge of acacias on
the Fulton street line of the park, from
Fourth to Tenth avenues.
The board accepted a skin boat for
Stow Lake from the Alaska Commer
cial Company.
The board reported adversely on a
proposition to construct a convenience
station on the panhandle.
J. A. Filcher, who was connected with
the California exhibit at the St. Louis
Exposition, made application to the
board for plants to be used at the Port
land exposition. The president suggest
ed that the application should be made
in writing.
An application was granted for the
assignment to Cyrus Dunker of thQ
contract of E. Aigeltinger & Co. for
supplying to the park hay, barley, bran
and oats.
An application of the Fire Depart
ment for full access to the roads of the
park for automobiles on departmental
business was considered. The Commis
sioners voted that such access should
be given to automobiles responding to
fire alarms.
R. B. Moore, commanding the cadet
corps of the Third Congregational
Church, asked permission for the corps
to enter the park under arms in order
to be photographed. The request was
granted, with a proviso that the inva
sion should not be later than 10 o'clock
In the day.
The Olympic Club asked permission
for a cross-country try-out through the
park. The application was granted.
Commissioner Earl Cummings pre
sented to the board a beautiful design
for a drinking fountain to be erected at
the granite basin in Washington
square. It is estimated that the bronze,
representing a traveler "drinking water
from a stream," can be constructed for
the sum of $2000. The Commissioners
thanked JJr. Cummings for his gener
osity and directed that proposals should
be invited for the work. If means are
found available the bronze will be or
dered.

ISH LA NA MAKES A RUNAWAY AFFAIR
OF THE HANDICAP AT OAKLAND.
REVIEW OF STARTERS
IN BURNS HANDICAP
The Field Has mi Open Look
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
The eleventh renewal of the Burns
handicap will be decided at Oakland
track this afternoon, and once more
will the battle for the $10,000 prize be
fought out over a muddy course. In
terest In the big race is widespread,
and visitors from all sections of the
Pacific Coast are here to see the race
run. **
Ten days ago horsemen and turf fol
lowers in general were almost a unit
in declaring for Claude, even though
Mike Daly's grand campaigner is asked
to carry 137 pounds, the most formid
able task ever asked of a thoroughbred
in this far Western country. Now,
with the sound of the post bugle al
most within hearing and a heavy,
holding track to race over, the com
plexion of things has changed some
what.
At the eleventh hour the inevitable
dark horse looms up. This year it is
Rockaway, owned and trained by the
master hand, Walter Jennings. The
son of Altamax is reported to have
worked the one and a quarter miles
over Ingleside track In 2:12 with a
large sized package of weight up. If
his trials have not been elaborated
upon, then Rockaway with 107 pounds
will take some beating this afternoon.
DALY PAIR FAVORITE.
Beyond question Claude and Elliott,
the Daly pair, will have first call in the
betting, 8 to 5 and 2 to 1 being quoted
about the pair last night. Claude is
not particular. Any distance, any sort
of track or weight is agreeable. He
can go out in front or come on from be
hind. Could anything more be asked
of a race horse? The distance looks a
furlong too far for Elliott and if the
Daly colors are successful Claude will
have to do the trick. He will have
Willie Daly on his back, while Alarie
pilots Elliott.
Garnet Ferguson is a firm believer in
his horse Military Man, and It must be
conceded that with 105 pounds to handle
tlfe chestnut has an undeniable chance.
Then, too, he will be ridden by the
crack lightweight, W. Davis, and this
fact alone is worthy of more than pass
ing consideration.
EZELL WELL REPRESENTED.
Louis Ezell will be represented by
two, the old rogue Flying Torpedo and
W. R. Condon, the latter a mud run
ner fOr fair. Many good judges think
the horse that beats Condon will wear
the floral horseshoe. In his clever ad
justing of the weights Handicapper
Egbert has asked the Ezell horse to
shoulder 112 pounds, at which weight
he looks nicely in.
In shuffling up the ctfrds the Skin
ner stable, Bombardier and Horatius.

BIDS ARE NOT
TO BE INVITED
The Public Utilities Committee of the
Board of Supervisors yesterday report
ed against the inauguration of proceed
ings looking to the invitation of bids
for a franchise for the Geary street
road and other roads for which peti
tions have been filed.
Action was taken as the result of a
petition filed by the San Francisco
Railway Company for a franchise from
Market and East streets, thence run
ning along Market to Pine, to Kearny,
to Geary, to Point Lobos avenue, to
Fifth and Tenth avenues to the park,
and also for a cross-line beginning at
Baker and Bay streets, thence running
along Bay street to Franklin, to Oak, to
Market, to Eleventh and Bryant streets.
The petition of the Geary Street Rail
way Company for a franchise on Geary
street was rejected one year ago, and
the committee decided that it would be
advisable not to consider any petitions
now in view of the fact that it is pro
posed to make efforts looking to the ac
quisition or operation of the Geary
street road by the municipality. The
company is paying 5 per cent of its
gross earnings to the city under a spe
cial agreement, the percentage aggre
gating about $8000 yearly.
C. G. Hooker offered to sell outside
lands block 271 to the city for a portion
of the Golden Gate Park and Presidio
extension for $40,000. The City Engineer
had appraised the block at $39,100, and
the committee made him a flat offer of
$38,500, which Hooker refused. The
committee will thus be compelled to re
sort to condemnation proceedings un
less Hooker relents.
M. J. Brandenstein offered to sell
portions of outside lands blocks 296, 169
and 84 for $71,250. The City Engineer's
appraisement of the lands offered ag
gregate but $49,975. but Brandenstein
would not reduce his figure. No ajarree
ment could be reached and condemna
tion proceedings will be resorted to In
this instance also. It will he necessary
to provide an additional sum in case
judgment for a greater amount than
the appraised value is obtained against
the city. Brandenstein contended that
a mistake had been made in the ap
praisement, which he held to be far too
low.
The committee decided to begin con
must not be lost sight of. Horatius
started in the handicap decided at As
cot Park last Saturday, finishing third
to Oxford and Schoolmate, the one and
a quarter miles being run in 2:06. At
the head of the stretch the bay horse
was tenth, and. at the wire, running
over horses, he did not lose by two
lengths. If the track at Oakland to
day suits him, and he can repeat the
Ascot Park performance, there is no
use in looking further for a winner.
Bombardier Is a mudder, too, and has
more than a flying peep at the pot.
PASADENA A FACTOR.
About the visitor from the southland,
Pasadena, little is known only from
hearsay. He was brought up from Los
Angeles by James Mclaughlin, once j
the premier jockey of America. Jimmy,
as he is affectionately termed by turf
ites, is more than twenty-one and is
better than a farm hand around horses.
The son of Ben Strome -was nearly a
first-class two-year-old and must not
be passed over too lightly. The three
year-old will be piloted by Grover
Cleveland Fuller, two -years ago the
idol of the East. The colt has 109
pounds to negotiate. If he can concede
the weight asked and land first, then
he is surely a bird.
Getting down near the foot of the
class there is an old veteran, whose
odds will be anywhere from 30 to 50 to
1. Barrack is the entry referred to. If
no more rain falls the track will be
just to his liking. Possibly he may be
beaten off, and then again the old cam
paigner may earn all the glory. There
will unquestionably be plenty of pace
and some of the leaders are going to
get tired. If they do begin backing up,
old Barrack will be coming on. If a
rank outsider is returned first, Barrack
will be the one.
Hooligan and Gateway do not look to
possess a chance.
Honiton is a doubtful starter while
Veterano has shown poorly in his trial.
Following are the probable starters,
with their weights, riders and prices
quoted at the downtown resorts last
evening:
Claude. 137 (TV. Daly) 1

Symmes Discusses "Civic Duty."
"Civic Duty" was the subject of an
address delivered last night by Frank
J. Symmes, president of the Merchants'
Association, before the American and
British Union in the Academy of
Sciences hall. Symmes advocated the
organization here of "the Voters'
League," an organization, he said, that
had worked remarkable changes in
civic affairs in Chicago. # Dr. F. W.
d'Evelyn said he had received a let
ter from Whitelaw Reid thanking the
union for its congratulations upon the
report of the President's intention to
appoint him to the British embassy,
demnation proceedings for all the lands
the price of which is in excess of the
official appraisements. Those within
the appraisements will be submitted to
the board for final action.

Major Tenny Beats Venator
Easily for Place Honors.
GREENOCK GALLOPS IN FIRST
There were no freight trains to block
the crossings no<- fog banks to obscure
the way for Ishlana in the seven-fur
long handicap yesterday at Oakland.
The mare's odds were pounded down
from 7 to 5 to even money, and she
spreadeagled the Either four starters.
Venator, the top weight, died away in
the stretch, losing the place to Major
Tenny by half a dozen lengths.
The first three choices served up net
ted their backers nothing. Then Briers,
Bell Reed and Ishlana turned the tide,
and the crowd did not fare so badly.
There was the usual large attendance.
THE LEDAEAN SCORES.
Ed. Tierney has been as busy as a
cranberry merchant endeavoring to
pick up a purse with Mr. Dingle. The
old horse went to the post favorite for
the first event, and fell rather easy
prey to The Ledaean. The latter re
ceived considerable support, and Mo-
Bride handled him to good advantage.
Bob Palmer, a 50 to 1 snot, ran third,
after making all the early pace.
Old Greenock fooled the smart ones
by taking the Futurity course sprint
following in an ordinary gallop. Re
ceding to 6 to 1. Mmaer rated him
aloiiC the first part of the race and the
ancient cripple breezed home five
lengths ahead of Dr. Sherman. The
show went to Waterspoat. Haven Run,
the favorite, could not untrack himself
in the heavy going.
MAXTRESS WINS HANDILY.
Maxtress, also- piloted by Minder,
made a runaway affair of the seven
furlong selling number. The mare
ruled third choice in the betting and
led from start to finish. Play Ball, a
13 to 1 shot, beat Foxy Grandpa for
place honors.
W Davis, on Briers, landed the mile
and a sixteenth purse. The ring laid
8 to 5 about the mare and she defeated
Anvil and Modicum without apparent
effort. Dungannon appeared anchored
in the deep footing.
Although Platt had a strong follow
ing in the speculating done on the five
and a half furlong sprint, the three
year-old was asked to give away too
much weight to Bell Reed. The latter
held the place of honor in the betting
and, holding Platt safe through the
stretch, earned the verdict by more
than a length. "Whoa Bill, outrun the
first part of it, finished a strong third.
TRACK NOTES.
Colonel W. E. Applegate departed
for New Orleans yesterday.
Grover Cleveland Fuller, who is to
ride Pasadena, will arrive from Los
Angeles this morning.
The Fleur de Lis stable will ship to
Los Angeles.
Minder and McÃride divided thÂ£
saddle honors, each piloting two win
ners.
P. Ryan will undoubtedly scratch
Honiton from the handicap.
T. T. Rector, who raced Billy Moore
and other horses here last year, died
at Hot Springs early during the pres
ent week of pneumonia.

TEXAS RANGER
SEEKS BANDIT
Lieutenant Wheeler of Fron
tier Police Here Trailing
Desperado From the South
HAS A FAMOUS EECOED
Quick With His Eevolver. lie
Assists in the Capture
of Many Border Outlaws
Trailing a desperate border character
from Mexico, back and forth through
Arizona and then into California has
been the difficult task allotted to Lieu
tenant Walter Hiram Wheeler of the
Texas Rangers, who is now in this city
looking up the doings of one of the
gentry that have made life miserable
for peaceful folk on the frontier.
Ranger Wheeler thinks his man has
escaped to British Columbia or has
taken refuge in the Antipodes. Yes
terday afternoon he was closeted with
the British Consul, Courtenay Bennett,
for half an hour, determining what had
best be done to overta-ke the criminal.
Lieutenant Wheeler, who has been
the guest of the local Police Depart
ment for two days and will be for five
days to come, is one of the most in
teresting characters of the land on the
edge of the United States. Small in
stature, courteous and soft spoken, he
does not Impress a casual observer as
being the game, efficient officer that the
detective forces of several big Ameri
can cities know him to be. But there
is courage and quick determination in
his face.
"I am here simply on a little matter
of business," modestly explained the
ranger. "My headquarters are at
Globe, Ariz., but of course I have to
cover a large territory in ferreting out
border crimes, as you are perhaps
aware. The ranger is everywhere. We
are summoned at a moment's notice to
report at a given place and it is a
matter of getting into the saddle and
away without much reference to per
sonal comfort or individual opinion.
My business here is to capture a man
who is supposed to have traveled re
cently through this country. I cannot
go into particulars about the case now,
but I may later."
Detective Tom Gibson, who met
Wheeler and his colleagues of the
rangers when he was in Arizona on a
criminal case, speaks in the highest
terms of the ranger's prowess. Wheeler
is not the sort to boast of his exploits,
but Gibson says the little, unsophisti
cated fellow from the cactus and sage
brush is one of the best pistol shots in
all the Southwestern Territories. It
was Wheeler with another ranger who
captured the famous Stiles gang of
train robbers and outlaws after a hard
Journey over the bleak mountains and
desert of a rough country. The out
laws were completely routed and
brought to justice.
Wheeler was once in a little Arizona
town during the holdup of a gambling
place. While walking down the main
street he saw a boy break desperately
through the door of the 'â¢joint." Shout
ing to the lad, he asked:
"What is the matter over there?"
"They're holding up the faro bank."
replied the youth, as he sped for safety.
Wheeler entered the saloon. Two
men had the crowd at the gambling
tables "covered." Without a moment's
hesitation he addressed the outlaw
nearest him.
"Here! What are you doing? Throw
up your hands."
The desperado swung his pistol to
ward Wheeler, but before he could pull
the trigger the ranger shot him dead.
The other highwayman escaped and the
"bank" was saved.
Ranger Wheeler has hope of finding
the criminal whom he has been seek
ing before he leaves for the fastnesses
of the gierra Madres or the dusty
plains of Texas and the Arizona coun
try.

THEATER FIGHT
GROWS BITTER
Contention That Ordinance
Discriminates in Favor
of the Older Structures
VALIDITY IS ATTACKED
Attorney for Cheap Shows
Asks Judge Seawell to
Declare the 3leasure Void
A significant remark was dropped in
the corridor outside of Judge Seawell's
courtroom yesterday by Julius Kahn.
He addressed a member of the Grand
Jury. He asked: "Why doesn't your
Foreman Andrews arrest his father-in
law. J. D. Pryor. The Tivoli has been
reconstructed since this ordinance was
passed."
Pryor owns the Tivoli property, but
the theater was constructed by the
company which manages it. Another
indication that the 10-cent vaudeville
houses believe the older and larger the
aters have a monopoly of the amuse
ment business developed in the argu
ment of Attorney H. C. McPike against
the validity of the ordinance prescrib
ing the matter in which theater build
ings shall be constructed.
McPike contended that the ordinance
divides the theaters into two classes â
those built after the ordinance was
passed in June, 1901. and those built be
fore. The new ones, at greatest ex
pense, and with regard for vigorous
rules, must be built according to the
law. The old ones merely had to be
remodeled, "so far as considered neces
sary" by the Board of Public Works
and the Fire Commissioners. This, de
clared the attorney, gave the old the
aters a monopoly of the business be
cause of the greater expense attendant
upon the building of a new house like
the Majestic. The discrimination, it
was contended, makes the ordinance in
valid, in that it gives arbitrary power
to minor officers to determine in how
far the buildings constructed before the
ordinance was passed snail comply
with its provisions.
District Attorney Byington interrupt
ed with a remark that the argument
should not go into the validity of the
ordinance; the hearing was upon an in
junction restraining the police from
committing certain acts and a court of
equity had no power to prevent the
police from doing those acts if the or
dinance was being validated. The court
replied that If the ordinance were
proved invalid It would be so much
waste paper, and the police could not
proceed under it. His mind, however,
had been made up that an injunction
could not prevent the arrest of persons
violating the ordinance if it were not
declared Invalid.
McPike admitted that the arrests
could be made, but insisted that in
these cases the police seek to close the
houses and thereby declare a forfeiture
of property which is not provided for
in the ordinance.
Before beginning his argument Mc-
Pike offered the evidence of Charles
Godchaux, an architect, who worked on
the plans of the Majestic. With an
enlarged plan, the witness explained
â each requirement of the ordinance and
was of the opinion that the provision
for an open court on the side of the
aters was not a safe protection from
fire, particularly if the adjoining build
ing was of frame. He was asked
whether the terms of the ordinance
were not onerous, rigid and difficult to
comply with. MÂ«\ Byington offered an
objection which the court sustained.
Other architects were in court to give
evidence on the same points, but the
court declined to hear them.
Julius Kahn. representing the Unique
Theater, informed the court that he
would at the next hearing discuss the
question of licenses, contending that
his theater had paid a license in
1901 and that the Board of Works has
no right to require a new permit every
year. The hearing was continued
until next Friday.
CUSTOMS FORCE REDUCED.â Six as
sistant weighers and seven laborers in the
United States Appraiser's stores were <iis
missed yesterday by order of the Secretary
nf the Treasury on account of a slackening up
in the work.
INFRINGEMENT OF LABELS.â C. R.
Spi'^alo & Co. yesterday sued L. R. Podesta
for $10,000 damages and an injunction pre
venting infringement of irade marks. Th*
plaintiff and defendant are rival manufacturers
of macaroni anri like pastes. The plaintiff
uses the word "royal" on its packages and
on the end of the boxes the words "Queen's
Taste." The defendant's infringement is aaid
to consist of the use of the words "loyal"
and "President's Taste." together with a efctM
imitation of the Spllvalo package.

The New Tork circular of Henry Clews j
sayÂ«: '"The chaotic conditions in Russia must
exercise a depressing influence upon European ;
bourses. Paris being the center of interest
from the financial standpoint. French hold- i
ing* of Russian bonUs are said to aggregate '
about $1,800,000,000, which have only been j
. saved from sharp depreciation through the
most powerful support on the part of the J
Â«reat European bankers. Unfortunately short j
tales have been made illegal, and the means
of eupport adopted Instead may well be likened
to the (Jamming of a stream, which only in
tensifies the flood in case of a break. Parisian
â¢ backers, however, have . been unquestionably
strengthening themselves, and much of the
cold withdrawn from this and other marietta
during the past few months has gone to Paris ,
far thÂ« purpose of riving support where most |
i-.eeded' and more seems likely to follow. i
Whether bankers who recently took the Berlin .
Issue, and those who are expected to take thÂ« |
forthcoming issue at IJ^fis. will succeed m
finding a market for these new issues remains j
to be itea. In any case the situation is a <
delicate one and requires close watching-
THE AMERICAN SITUATION.
"The local situation Is goÂ« J. Large railroad .
*arr.lngs and bank clearings both testify to
th* heavy volume of business In progress.
â¢ Farmers North, South. East and West are un
usually prosperous. Manufacturers are gen
erally well employed and the great iron in
dustry showt an altogether unexpected de
cree of activity at this season, having booked
orders In advance that will keep furnaces j
and mills busy for several 'months to come.
Tliere is, consequently, no diminution of earn
ing capacity In sight for either railroads or
industrials. The only drawbacks are that â 
pood dlvidand-payinf blocks seem exceedingly I
high and the investment demand is abating,
â Jthoue-h desirably bonds etfll find ready buy
eie. Such conditions divert attention from,
established dividend payers to those which
' have recently entered the dividend list, or to
these which have a good chance of so doing
if present prosperity continues. Speculation
has, consequently, been most active In these
two classes or stock*, and operations were
thUF confined to a few specialties manipulated
by their respect cliques. Money rates con
tinue easy and gold shipments had little or
ro influence." Bankers' look for easy rates
; :cht along, this being one of the strongest
incucements for the holding of stocks, Bullish
*Â»rthusiasm had been materially checked by
recent events and a moderate decline fol
â  :'Â«fd: but there it. a genera! indisposition to
part with rtocks while the situation at large
is co satisfactory, particularly as any im
provement In the Russian situation or a genu
ine peace movement would impart additional I
urength to thÂ« market Vice versa, aggrava
t'.cn of revolutionary symptoms in Russia
â¢â¢ould induce fresh selling, especially abroad.
For â¢.- time being legislative 'movements at
Washington are overshadowed, although an
â¢-â >â .-* session for the purpose of railroad and
tariff legislation is probable next October.
As said in our previous advices, no radical
lt-gislation â â¢â â¢- likely."

New York Stork Market.
NEW YORK, Feb. 3.â There was continued
* active speculation in stocks to-day and con
siderable further advance In -the price level.
The movement was uneven and intermittent,
tbc advance shifting from one point to another.
There was no definite news to account for
f-Â» demand, which was based on general con
siderations and which was fostered by the
extreme abundance of money. Principal in
terest centered in railroads of the. Eastern
part of the country, although . there was some
recurrence of strength - later in the . day in
tbe Pacific*. Reading continued to be the
feature of the market and the rapid enhance
ment in its Quotations had a material effect
on the coalers and the . Pennsylvania . group |
rarticular'r- Another motive for the marking
â up of the price of Pennsylvania was for the
purpose ol fidJuVtng It to the recent wide
advance in New ' York Central. A movement
in either one of the standard trunk line stocks
is certain sooner or later to be followed b>
the <rth*r to preserve a certain parity between
th*m. Pennsylvania â Is naturally benefited by
thÂ» Frrwth in. value of the various companies
in which It holds a dominant interest. â  and
*sp^cia!!y hy the Increased dividend disburse
ments on many of Its controlled stocks. The
retf cf accumulation of Pennsylvania, and in
. fact, of Â»!1 thÂ« coalers, was very rapid*
Blocks, of 100 to 0000 s-hsr*-* were constantly
trfia??errrd. The announcement of the South
ern Pacific refunding plan revived the demand
for the Pacifies, but did not carry the move
ment In them far. Thl* plan has already
flcurf" to Â«uch an extent in the previous rise
in both Southern Pacific and Union Pacific
that its Influence aÂ« a market factor ' waÂ»
lejpejy exhausted before its announcement.
There was â¢'â¢me awakening In Rock Island
after a long period of comparative neglect,
hut that movement also was not well sus
tained. It seemed to be bsÂ»ed"upon the inti
mation that the supposed change of control
In Kansas City Southern and Colorado and
Southern was designed in the Rock Island In
terest. Atchison hung back during the period
of strength and wm onÂ« of the nrpr stocks to
weaken. The prospect of a prosecution i n the
Colorado Fuel rebate case is -not relished by
Ftockholder*. especially in view of the present
public attention aroused to this whole sub
ject. The extremity to which the grain rate
war is twin* carried must be taken some ac
count of in repard to the earning power of
the grangers. A number of the utocks which
have had unexplained advances relapsed sharp
ly to-day when efforts were made to dispose
of recently ' accumulated holdings. Th- Du
luth. South Shore and Atlantic stocks were an
example and the Minneapolis, St. Paul and j
Pte. Marie storks also were heavy. Chicago.
Ft Paul. Minneapolis and Omaha preferred. !
the 'purchase of â¢"â¢<> shares of which causes !
a rite of 35 points the other day. relapsed â¢
to-<*ay 25 points on a sale of 400 share*. The j
active realizing movement , to-day was coin
cident -with the appearance . of the ei>tlmat?s
"ti the week's currency movement, indicating
s. lr.os of cash by the banks of upward -of
$5,000,000, dee to the excess of gold exports
over the receipts from the Interior. The re
r.ewed strength of the . coalers, however, and
a rush to buy MiÂ«!Â«Turi Pacific pulled the j
msrket up and made the cloving; strong.
Bonds were lrrerultr. Total sales, par I

CHICAGO BOARD OP TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. Fsb. B.â The feature of trading !
in wheat was the relative strength and ac
tivity of the July delivery. The temporary I
supplanting of the May option by the more
distant months was due to an awakened real
ization of the possibility of a ehortage of
wheat durinjc the months of June and July
Fear of this contingency wat emphasized
through a report by a St. Louis trade journal â¢
that many complaint* of damage to winter
wheat by cold weather had been received. Thi
market was also bullishly affected by the de
cision of Attorney General Moody regarding
"drawbacks" on wheat Imported for the man
ufacture into flour for export. The action of
a leading operator In buying July and selling
May was a factor in causing disparity between
the two leading options. At the opening the
market was quite firm. May being up 4Â«j>y 4 c
at *1 17 to $1 174- July opened at 9tt%f>;Â»9%. I
Predictions of snows throughout the West and
HnuthwsFt caused some selling of July early in
the session and resulted in a decline to 8034 c j
A leader of the bull crowd was an active '
seller .'of May. Gradually, but surely, the price
'of â  that ' delivery ; sank lower. The ! same trader,
however,' . soon ' started buying *â  quite v' freely.
Pit traders followed the lead. :â¢ From Â»94c July
rose to $1,004. . Late .-in', the t day some reac
tion occurred on profit taking, final; quotations
.on , July being at ; $1.001.,. \ The May delivery
sold off to $1 lti's and closed weak at $1 16%

WHEATâ The decline at Chicago and the

lied. Tlowever. and closed in the afternoon at
$1 61 14. December kept steady all day at
about previous' prices. The cash grain showed
no change and was quiet.

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
Previous conditions still prevailed in the
I Potato market, fancy Burbanks being in good
request at steady rates while low-grade of
ferings, particularly river kinds, were not
wanted. The market was still overstocked
with poor Sweet Potatoes and several carloads
that had been standing on the railroad track
for several days had to be sent to the Crema
tory. Onions ruled weak at unchanged prices.
Aside from String Beans, which were still
scarce and high, all descriptions of southern
vegetables were in free supply and lower prices
ruled for Tomatoes, Summer Squash and Egg
Plant. A box of Asparagus from Alameda
County sold at 50c and two boxes from Isleton
on the Sacramento River were held at 75c per
pound.

Poultry and Game.
The receipts of domestic Poultry were lib
eral and a portion of a car of Western that
came In on Thursday was still on hand. The '
market was weaker, but quotations were un- I
changed, although large holders were cutting
prices In order to effect clearances. Dressed
Turkeys were In Increased supply and, being I
mostly of poor quality, sold at a lower range, i
There was a little better demand for Game '
and the most kinds cleaned up readily at the !
old quotations.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Butter was weaker yesterday and, though
receipts were lighter, there was more on the
market than for some time past. Further- :
more, the demand was slack and, as stocks |
â¢showed signs of accumulating and the north- I
era orders have been lost, there was a gen
eral selling movement, which resulted In a j
decline. The warm rain. too. Is against the '
market and creative of lower prices. All sell- â 
ers complained of the dullness of trade.
Eggs continued steady, with store and ranch i
closely together In price. As a general thing
the market wae fairly cleaned up. though sev- >
eral houses reported accumulating stocks. The '
warm rain will probably result In larger re
eatpta In a few days and dealers are disposed
to sell the goods and keep their floors clean.
There is nothing new in Cheese.
Receipts were 44.800 lbs Butter. 615 cases
Eggs and 2800 lbg Cheese.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
All kinds ot fresh fruits, particularly^Apples '
and Oranges, were in heavy supply, and. with
! trade still hampered by the Inclement weather.
' the market was very weak, with dealer* con
j ceding to buyers right along. The orange
i auction was postponed until Monday owing to
j the unfavorable market conditions, and the
| fact that only, two cars were available for
auction purposes. It is not likely that the
offerings at Monday's sale will be large, aa
OMSJt of the packing -houses in the southern
growing districts are closed owing to the rain,
which checked picking operations, and sup
plies on the way to this market are said to bo
light. I Two more carloads of Apples arrived
' from Jhe north, making twenty for the week,
| and me market for that fruit is very weak
; for everything except high-grade Spitzenbergs
and Newtown Pippins.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL. SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1905
MAY CHAMPION
MAYOR'S CAUSE
A. Paiof Is Being Seriously
Considered for Successor
to Finn as Supervisor
Mayor Schmitx is considering the
wisdom of appointing Abe Ruef as Su
pervisor to fill the vacancy caused by
the transfer of Supervisor Thomas
Finn to membership on the Board of
Fire Commissioners.
"1 should very much like to have
Mr. Ruef on the Board of Supervisors,"
said the Mayor yesterday. "I consider
him thoroughly qualified and com
petent to withstand any attacks that
may be made upon me or my adminis
tration."
There is doubt whether R'uef's busi
ness would permit him to devote his
time to the office. It has been pointed
out that it would only be necessary for
him to be present for two or three
hourÃ at each weekly meeting of the
board.
The only other man who has been
considered is Election Commissioner
Devoto. The charter provision dis
qualifying an Election Commissioner
from holding another ottlee within one
year after the expiration of his term
has no terrors for Mayor Schmitz.
"1 believe Mr. Devoto competent to
act as Supervisor," said the Mayor. "I
do not expect any trouble on account of
the charter prohibition. The only way
to contest the seating of Devoto would
be by quo warranto proceeding, which
could be brought only with the consent
of the Attorney General. I do not think
Mr. Webb would permit the doing of
Democratic politics by the Supervisors.
The Mayor said that he had not as
yet decided on Hutton's successor as
Police Commissioner. Jeremiah Dineen

LETTER CARRIER
NEATLY CAUGHT
Inspector O'Connell Traps
"William J. McGraw Steal
ing, Finding Booty on Him
PLUNDER IS IDENTIFIED
Prisoner Would Have Been
Promoted to Higher Grade
Within Next Two Weeks
William J. McGraw, a second class
mail carrier, with a wife and a ten- 'â¢
months-old baby on his hands, was |
locked up yesterday in the prisoners'
room at the United States Marshal's
office, with the prospect of imprison- '
ment in the penitentiary staring him
in the face. He had been caught like
a rat in a trap set by Postoffice In
spector ,James O'Connell, and his ca
reer as a thief in uniform had ab- ,
ruptly terminated. Part of the money
he had stolen from registered letters
was found in his possession. The j
money had been marked before be
ing placed in the letter from which it
had been extracted by McGraw and
its identification conclusively proved
his guilt.
Many complaints were received at !
the postofflce .that registered letters
containing money had never reached
their destinations. Other letters
reached the addresses minus the
money they had contained and show
ing marks also of having been bro
ken open. Others that had not con
tained money were mutilated by some
person who had been examining them
for money. It was not long before In
spector O'Connell traced the leaks to
McGraw, and steps were secretly tak
en to build up an impregnable case
against him.
Among the letters received by Me- !
Graw yesterday morning to deliver on i
his first round was a registered letter
addressed to G. W. Lee, 1604 Powell
street. Through an intentional omis
sion McGraw was not required to re
ceipt for this packet and thfe address
was not on his beat, so that the dis
honest carrier was assured that the
possession of it could not be traced
to him. A postoffice inspector sta
tioned at Mr. Lee's address notified
Inspector O'Connell that the carrier
had not made his appearance at that I
place and when McGraw returned to
the main postofflce O'Connell asked
him for the letter. McGraw denied :
ever having had it In his possession. ;
The inspector thereupon searched him
and found in his righthand hip pocket ,
a purse containing a $1 silver sertifl- :
cate, three 2-cent stamps and a half- j
dollar piece. All three articles had i
been privately marked by O'Connell
before being placed in the registered
letter addressed to Mr. Lee. He was
at once taken in charge by the United
States Marshal and shortly thereafter
Inspector O'Connell swore to a com
plaint before United States Commis
sioner Heacock and a warrant was is- !
sued. Wednesday next was set as the i
date of the preliminary examination.
McGraw is a good-looking man of
33 years. He* entered the postal ser
vice on August 1, 1901, as a substitute
carrier. On February 12, 1903, he
was appointed a regular carrier of the
third class. A year later he was
raised to the second class and on the
12th of the present month he would
have been promoted to the first class.
McGraw attempted to divert suspi
cion by sealing letters that he had
partly torn open and stamping upon
the envelope "Accidentally mutilated'
by the stamping machine." But such
stamping is done at the ferry and the
printing is different on the stamp used
by McGraw.
McGraw's bail was fixed at $1000,
failing to obtain which he was sent
to the County Jail.

HIDES INFANTS
FROM HIS WIFE
Man Who Wanted to Be an
Alderman at Victoria Is
; Defendant in Divorce Suit
t-i
CRUELTY IS CHARGED
Mrs. Salmon Says Husband
Has Threatened to Kill
His Family and Himself
For a man who had aldermanic as-
pirations at Victoria, B. C, the do- !
mestic conduct of Henry L. Salmon !
did not comport with his civic preten- !
sions, according to the contents of a J
divorce complaint filed yesterday by |
his wife, Fredrica Salmon. She says '
he has been cruel, even to the extent
of threatening to murder her, their i
children and himself. They were i
married in 1891 and four years ago, !
she says, he deeded her $10,000 worth
of property, but asked her to recon- ;
vey it in trust in order that he might |
qualify as an Alderman. He failed of
election, but kept the property. After .
their second child was born and while :
she was in a hospital, she says, he j
took the babe and their little girl and j
secreted them for a month. In Sep
tember last he again took the two !
children and has kept them. A few \
days ago he sent some one purporting '
to be a policeman to take their third i
baby from her, charging that she was j
not a fit person to care for it. She |
says he has an income of over $300
a month and she demands $1000 for
her attorneys and $250 costs.
Judge Graham encountered hard luck
yeterday . when he tendered his of
fices as reconciler to Joseph and Jo
hanna Hearne. Joseph is suing for i
divorce on the ground of cruelty. The ;
Judge called the pair before the bar
and asked them to make up, where
upon Joseph delivered a telling ora- j
tlon and the court postponed the ;
hearing for two weeks. Hearne aaid j
he was an Englishman born and did J
not believe in divorces, but he was \
willing td waive his scruples in this i
regard. "Tour Honor," he said, "I've
been in hell for four years and eight
months and I think that is long
enough for a man to be in hell." With
many a "shelp me God" to emphasize
his statements, Joseph told a long
qfory of his woes. He said he had
found two razors in his bed, which his
wife had put there in order that she
might kill him in the night, and
often, in fear of his life, he has locked
himself in a separate bedroom. He
declared she had taken carbolic acid,
had threatened to jump into the ocean
with his boy and had frightened his
daughter into hysterics. When he had
finished the story he asked the Judge
how he would like it himself, and the
court abandoned its conciliatory ef
forts.

Shakespearean reader, from Morgia
Lord-Whitney, a chorus girl, whose
whereabouts is unknown to the hus
band. They were married in May,
1903, and she lived with him only six
weeks. By the same Judge a divorce
was granted to Mabel L. Hatman from
Frank C. Hatman. a machinist at
Mare Island, on the ground of deser
tion.
The young wife of "William Foster,
an employe of the Standard Milk
Company, wants a divorce from him
on the ground of cruelty. They were
married a year ago this month in Ala
meda and have a baby, which the
father doesn't like. She says he holds
the infant aloft by the leg and places
his heavy hand over its mouth to
stifle its cries. Besides he, has a lik
ing for other women, and last Christ
mas received gifts of a muffler and
box of handkerchiefs from on a Hattie
Murasky. He said the gifts were bet
ter than any he had ever received
from his wife.
Other actions for legal separation
were begun by Katherine L. Short
against James' W. Short for cruelty
and by Bessie M. Hollingsworth
against C. Hollingsworth for neglect
and desertion.
BURGLAR UNDER
WOMAN'S BED
3liss Millie Weidenmuiler
Steps on Him When She
Arises to Light the Gas
Miss Millie Weidenmuller of 2C03 Pine
i street stepped on a maji who was
| crawling from under her bed night be
! fore last, and her sister. Miss Eliza
! beth, who was occupying another bed
in the same room, soon joined her in
an outburst of screaming that awak
ened the whole neighborhood. Meantime
the intruder made his escape without
leaving a tangible clew to his identity.
Miss Weidenmuller had arisen to light
the gas.
The suspicions of L. A. Weidenmuller,
brother of the young women, pointed
to the Japanese servant yesterday
morning, and the boy was summarily
dismissed. But the police have not
credited these suspicions and nothing
ha.s been done toward connecting the
young Japanese with attempted burg
lary. He stoutly asserts his innocence,
laying that he went to bed at 11 o'clock
and was deep in slumber at the time of
the excitement, which was 12:15 o'clock.
So far was he buried in his blankets
that he did not even hear the hue and
the cry the ladies raised.
Yesterday morning, when accused by
Mr. Weidenmuller, the boy was very
much surprised. After he had finished
the morning's work Miss Millie came to
him again accusing him of secreting
himself under her bed. He made de
nial, but she told him that his services
were no longer desired. He had been
employed in the household for six
months.
There have been two weddings in
the house within the last few months
and a considerable quantity of Jewelry
and silverware, received as gifts, are
displayed about the rooms. It is the
orized that a porch-climber, aware of
this fact, had secreted himself under
the bed early in the evening. There
was a gathering of friends in the house
during the evening and it would have
been easy for him to enter through a
rear door.
What puzzles the police is the fact
that after the burglar fled not a win
dow or door could be found unlocked.
Policeman Connolly thinks, however,
that escape might have been effected
through the front door.
Burglar Pleads Guilty.
David Grant, alias Frank McCor
mick, an ex-convict, pleaded guilty in
Judge L,awlor"s court yesterday to a
Â»:harge of burglary and will be sen
tenced to-day. He broke into the
jewelry store of S. Hyman, 124 Powell
street, on December 3 and stole a num
ber of watches, opera glasses and other
articles. He and William White, also
an ex-convict, were tried yesterday
afternoon on a charge of burplary for
breaking into a clothing store at 827
Kearny street on December 12 and the
jury acquitted them.
