SEOUL, March 14.â The funeral of
the Queen Dowager, who died in Jan

was placed on a catafalque at the
west gate of the city, where United
States Minister Allen and other dip
lomats gathered at 5:30 o'clock this
morning.
It was a weird scene. Thousands of
lantern bearers, soldiery and the pop
ulace in white dresses gathered around
a bonfire until daybreak. The Em
peror, attired in straw colored robes
and headdress, arrived at 6 o'clock and
performed his devotions over the body
within a canvas pavilion. The pro
cession then started for the tomb, eight
miles outside the city, the bands play
ing funeral dirges.
The procession was a couple of miles
long and full of Oriental color. It was
headed by native police, followed by
lantern bearers and spearsmen in fan-,
tastic attire, carrying banners and
huge paper horses. Then came two
biers, gorgeously colored, and sur
mounted by dragons' heads. They were,
borne on the shoulders of a hundred
men, there being 200 pallbearers. The
biers were surrounded by eunuchs and
court functionaries. The first bier was
empty, being Intended to cheat the

The highest Russian opinion obtain

to oppose the Chinese.
The same opinion asserts that Vice
Admiral Makaroff will fight hard. He
is determined to weaken the enemy at
any cost and make the operation of
the Baltic Sea fleet in the Far East

to fight .-without -the Pallada, the Ce

is " admitted; cannot be. fully repaired
within six months. On account of the
uncertainty of the success of the
scheme of constructing a mud dock
In which to repair the Oesarevitch and
Retvizan, naval experts allow a full

" YINKOW, March 14.â The local
Russian authorities are apparently in
censed and manifestly much annoyed
at the solicitious inquiries of the com
manders of foreign gunboats regard
ing the projected blocking of the Liao
River before the arrival of the Jap
anese, which latter event is regarded
as a foregone conclusion. Although
the blocking of the Liao and also the
defense of the settlement arid native
town are regarded as unattainable, it
is " certain that an important disposi
tion of guns and the arrangement of a
defense plan have already been made.
The arrival of General Kondratovifch
a few days ago, however, arrested the
arrangements and threatened to cause
the abandonment of the original inten

TO RETIRE BEFORE
ENEMY'S ADVANCE
SEOUL, March 12 (via Chefu, March
14). â It can now be stated positively
that the Japanese lost one cruiser in
the first naval engagement of the war,
which occurred off the harbor of Che
mulpo. Foreign residents of Chemulpo
who investigated the report that a
Japanese warship, disabled and aban
doned, was stranded on the beach sev
eral miles from the harbor entrance,
found that it was true. The vessel, is
aground In the mud fiats, only her
stem and funnels being above water at
low tide. Apparently she was an un
armored cruiser of the second class.
Some miles to the southward of . this
sunken warship is the hulk of a trans
port, which was driven ashore during a
gale while the Japanese army was be
ing transported to .; Seoul. . It is pre
sumed that the_ soldiers aboard the
transport succeeded in reaching shore.

The Daily Chronicle, commenting on
the' statement that it is Russia's . in
tention to fall back indefinitely until
she has 300,000 troops concentrated for
an advance, to ,say nothing of 200,000
more to watch the Chinese frontier,
says:
LONDON, March 15.â Premature, so
far as the latest reports received this
morning tell us, is the story that Port
Arthur has been either evacuated or
captured by the Japanese. At the same
time, judging from dispatches received
from all sources, the,re seems to be an
impression that the Russians are pre
paring for what is the Inevitable out
come of Japan's complete control of
the sea. Commenting on the situation
Rear Admiral Ingles, writing in the
Daily Telegraph this morning, says:
"It is perfectly certain to my mind
that the Japanese navy has decided
that the capitulation of Port Arthur
has become an immediate necessity.
Nothing will now stop Admiral Togo
unless it is an immediate negative from
the Emperor himself. The capture of
Port Arthur; is, I believe, only an affair
of a day, and then the whole coast of
China is entirejy in the hands of the
Japanese, . to do what they like with.
Vladivostok does not count further..
"Details of the naval battle off Port
Arthur have only confirmed me in this
idea. Even now there are probably
mines laid down across the entrance to
the harbor which will prevent the
Novlk and. the Bayan ever coming out
again, and as the power of the forts
and their supply of -^ammunition be
comes less and less, eo the cordon of
ships will be drawn tighter and tighter."
JAPAN'S OUTLOOK BRIGHT.
News has been received here, of the
first accident to a war correspondent,
Mr. McKenzie, the representative of the
Daily Mail in Korea, having suffered
the breaking of both his legs by a fall
from a pony.
is believed that It will not be necessary
to spend abroad more than an eighth
of the cost of the war, this expendi
ture being chiefly on coal, cordite and
steel.
LONDON, March 15. â A correspond
ent of the Daily Mail at Newchwang
says that after the removal of the
battleship Retvizan four Russian
steamships â the Harbin, the Hailar,
the- Ninguta,. and the Sungariâ were
anchored at the mouth of the entrance
of Port Arthur in proper position and
sunk, leaving only a small channel
available. Vice Admiral Makaroff hav
ing previously ordered the ?hole fleet
to remain outside with steam up, econ
omy in coal being unnecessary.
This dispatch, which is prominently
displayed by the Daily Mail, and
which, the correspondent says, is "on
Russian information." is, if true, news
of the first importance, confirming, the
idea that Vice Admiral Makaroff will
adopt the offensive and make a des
perate attempt to bring together Rus
sia's scattered naval forces or en
deavor to inflict damage upon the Jap
anese anvy. The . story must, how
ever", be viewed cautiously, the only
approach of confirmation from any
other quarter being in a dispatch from
a correspondent of the Daily Tele
graph at Yinkow, which merely says:
".Vice Admiral Makaroff has issued
orders to the effect that I the saving
of coal is unnecessary, but that the
big gun ammunition In the forts must
not be wasted. Evidently" this ammu
nition is running short."
The Daily Telegraph's Tokio corres
pondent sends, an unconfirmed rumor
to the effect that Japanese marines
have la/ided and occupied Dalny;
- It is a. subject of unceasing remark
and conjecture that nothing has been
heard of the Vladlvostok'squadron^ and
it la beginning to be believed that it is
really inside the harbor of Vladivostok.
The Japanese navy includes three
cruisersâ the Adsuma, the Asama and
the Sumaâ either one of which might
be the "Asuraa" referred to in the fore
going dispatch.

Four of the nine Justices dissented
outright. These were Chief Justice
Fuller and Justices White, Peckham
and Holmes. The opinions of Justices
Harlan and White were long, while
those of Justices Brewer and Holmes
were comparatively brief. All told the
court consumed two hours and three
quarters In disposing of the case. The
fact was noted by several persons that
the argument In the case was begun
December 14, Just three months pre
vious to the decision. For so impor
tant a case this is considered a very
brief interim between the arguments
and the decision.
The case decided to-day was brought
by the United States against the
Northern Securities Company, a cor
pcration of New Jersey; the Great
Northern Railroad Company, a corpor
ation of Minnesota; the Northern Pa
cific Railway Company,- a corporation
of Wisconsin: James J. Hill, a citizen

JUDGES DISAGREE.
There was no surprise manifested
when, promptly on the assembling of
court. Justice Harlan began the deliv
ery of the opinion. The fact that he
had been selected for the preparation
of the document at once led most peo
ple to conclude that the decision wouM
uphold the Sherman anti-trust law and
sustain the contention of the Govern
ment. The Justice read his opinion
from a printed copy, which covered
thirty pages, and consumed about an
hour and a quarter In its delivery.
Very soon after Justice Harlan had
concluded his presentation of the case
it became evident that the court had
divided on the questions at issue, and
as other opinions were announced it
developed that there not only had been
a very close shave for the Government,
but that one. of the members of the
court who cast his vote with the ma
jority entertained opinions of his own.
which fact rendered the division all the
more marked and interesting. This was
Justice Brewer, who, while he concur
red in the decision, announced In an
Independent opinion his view that pre
vious anti-trust decisions had been
more sweeping than was justified.
OPINION EXPECTED.
WASHINGTON, March 14.â In the
Supreme Court of the United States to
day an opinion was delivered in the
merger case of the Northern Securities
Company vs. the United States in favor
of the Government's contention that
the merger was illegal. The opinion of
the court was handed down by Justice
Harlan. and it upheld the decree of the
Circuit Court for the District of Minne
sota in every particular. Four of the
Justices dissented from the five consti
tuting the majority. The division of the
court was due to a difference of opinion
as to the right of Federal control of
State corporation 3. The majority opin
ion proceeded on the theory that Con
gress has a right under the constitu
tion to control interstate commerce, no
matter by whom conducted, while the
minority or dissenting opinion was
based on the theory that in the present
case the effort is to regulate the owner
ship, not interstate traffic.
An effort was made by the court to
prevent the knowledge of the fact that
the opinion was to be rendered to-day
from getting to the public, but never
theless, it was quite generally under
stood among newspaper men, attorneys
and others for an hour or so before the
convening of court to-day that the
opinion would be announced. When,
therefore, the members of the court
filed into the chamber they were met
by an exnectant crowd, which filled
every seat- both inside and outside the
bar. Seated among the attorneys were
Attorney General Knox and Secretary
Taft and an unusual number of Sen
ators and members of the House.

several hundred yards above and with
a long pole was rafting his way in the
direction of the county road, along
which is a grade four or five feet high.
Suddenly Sweeney disappeared. Hia
friends went to investigate and found
that the raft had struck the top of a
post and Sweeney could not be found.
The eearchers were surprised to find
on .the raft a complete outflt for
blowing a hole in the county road so
the waters would run off his land. But
for the mishap which cost Sweeney's

acres of fine growing grain destroyed.

SAN JOSE,. March 14.â A decision
was rendered by Judge Tuttle of the
Superior Court to-day which will be
interesting to the various county offi
cials of the State, as it is. rendered
under a late law which subjects* the
saJaries of county officers to garnish
ment. The court ordered a peremptory
writ of mandate to be issued to County
Auditor Parker directing him to draw
a warrant in favor of Jc-hn T. Wallace,
Justice of the Peace, to satisfy a claim
against ex-County Auditor Murphy
held by Mrs. Laura Erkson. Murphy
owed Mrs. Erkson a board bill of $65
for himself and family. She obtained
a judgment against him in the Justice
Court, but he failed to satisfy it. A
couple of weeks ago Murphy retired
frc-m the office of Auditor. Be'fore he
could draw his money Mrs. Erkson ap
plied to the Superior Court for a writ
compelling his successor to issue a war
rant to Justice Wallace against money
coming to Murphy to satisfy her judg
ment. Prior to the time when the
salary of Murphy became due Murphy
had made an assignment ot the money
to T. C. Hogan, G. Geoffrey and Wil
liam Osterman for money advanced to
him, and it was contended that by rea
son of such assignments the money had
passed out of his control and that no
attachable interest existed. Judge Tut
tle, however, ordered a warrant drawn
to satisfy the Judgment. Ten days
stay of execution was granted the de
fendants, however, to prepare a mo
tion for a new trial.

This combination Is within the meaning -of

commerce and that Is enough to bring it under

one ownership. Necessarily by this combina
tion or arrangement the holding company In
the fullest sense dominates the situation in
the interest of those, who were stockholders' of
the constituent companies; as much bo for every
practical purpose as if It had been itself a
railroad corporation which had built, organ
ized and operated both lines for tlfj exclusive
benefit of its stockholders. Necessarily, also,
the constituent companies ceased, under such
a combination, , to be in active competition for
trade and commerce along their respective lines
and have become practically one powerful con
solidated corporation by the name of a holding
corporation, the principal, Jf not the sole ob
ject for the formation of which was to carry
out the purpose of the original combination
under which competition between the' con
stituent companies would cease.
The stockholders of the two old companies
are now united in their interest In preventing
all competition between the two lines. They
would take rare that no persons Â¦ are . chosen
directors of the holding company who will per

Having outlined these preliminaries.
Justice Harlan came immediately to
the judicial consideration of the case
and practically indicated- the decision
of the court in the first sentence of the
opinion proper. In that sentence he
said: -
In our judgment the evidence fully sustains
the material ailegatlonÂ« of the bill and shows
a violation of the act of Congress in eo far as
it declares illegal every combination or cvn
eplracy in restraint of commerce among the
several States and with foreign nations and
forbids RttempU to monopolize such commerce.
The several defendants denied all the allega
tions of the bill imputing to them a purpese
to evade the provision* of tho act of Congress
or to form a combination cr conspiracy having
for itÂ« object cither to restrain x>r to monopo
lize commerce or trade among the States or
with foreign nations. They denied that any
combination or conspiracy was formed In viola
tion of the act.
Of the railroads' case, he said
After announcing the origin arid the
purpose sought to be accomplished by
the suit, Justice Harlan reviewed the
facts, as disclosed by tha record in the
case. 'Of the Government's â¢ case he
said:
The Government charges that if the combina
tion was held not to be In. violation of the act
of Congress, then all efforts of the national
Government to preserve to the people the bene
fits of free competition among carriers engaged
In Interstate commerce will be wholly unavail
ing and all transcontinental lines, indeed the
entire railroad system of the country, may be
absorbed, merged and consolidated, thus plac^
ing the public at the absolute mercy of the
holding corporation.

George F. Baker^and Daniel -Lamont,
citizens of New York."" Its" general ob
ject was to enforce, as against the de
fendants, the provisions of the statute
Â¦of July 2, 1890, commonly known as the
anti-trust act. and entitled "An act to
protect trade and commerce against un
lawful restraint and monopolies."
REVIEWS FACTS..
That to vitiate a- combination, such as the
act of Congress condemns. .It need not le
shown that such combination In fact results
or wilt . result In a total suppression of tradÂ»
cr In a complete monopoly, but It Is only es
pentlnl to show that by its necessary operation
It tands to restrain Interstate or International
trade or commerce, or tends to create a mo
nopoly In Â«urh trade or commerce and to de
prive the public of the advantages that flow
from free competition.
That the constitutional guarantee of liberty
of contract does not prevent Consress from
prescribing the rule of free competition for
those engaged in Interstate and international
commerce.
'â¢ That under Itg power to regulate commerce
That the natural effoct of competition Is to
Increase corr>merce and an asriÂ»Tnent whose
direct effect Is to prevent this "lay of compe
tition restrains Inpteads of promotes traclf and
commerce.
That every combination or conspiracy v.-hich
would extinguish competition b*twsen other
wise compiling railroads engaged in Interstate
trade cr commerce and which would ln-tKat
way restrain sv.ch trade or commerce Is made
Illegal bv the act.
That Congress has the power to establish
rules by which interstate or International com
merce shall be governed and bv the anti-trust
art has prescribed the rule of free competition
nirnns those engaged In such commerce.
That combinations even among private man
ufacturers or dealers whereby interstate or In
ternational commerce U restralne are equally
embraced by the act. â¢ Â¦
' That railroad carriers engaged In interstate
or International 'rarte or commerce are em
braced by the act.
That the act is not limited to restraints of
Interstate and international trade or commerce
that e.re unreasonable In their nature, but Is
directed against all direct restraints, reasonable
or unreasonable. Imposed by any combination,
conspiracy or monopoly upon such trade or
commerce.
ACT OPPOSES MONOPOLY.
That although the act of Congress known as
the anti-trust act has no reference to the mere
manufacture and production of articles or
commodities within the limits of the several
States, it embraces and declares to be Illegal
every contract, combination . or conspiracy In
whatever form, <*r whatever nature, and who.
ever may be parties to It whjch directly or
nei-eHsarlly o;y!ratf>8 !n restraint of trade or
commerce arannj the several States or with
foreign nations. Â«
He agreed with the summing up by
the Circuit Court of the results of the
combination, which was that it places
the control of the ' two roada in the
hands of a single person and, second,
that it destroyed every motive for com
petition between the two lines by pool
ing their earnings, notwithstanding
both were engaged in interstate traffic.
Entering upon an investigation of the
authorities bearing on the case. Justice
Harlan deduced from the consideration
of these precedents the following
propositions as applied to the present
case:
to have protected. If not destroyed all the
advantages that wnuld naturally come to the
public under the operation of the general law
of competition as between the* Great Northern
and Northern Pacific railway* will be lost and
the entire Commerce of the Immense territory
In tho northern part of the United States be
tween the Grer.t Lakes and Pacific at Pugst
Round would be at the mercy of a single hold
ing corporation organized in a State distant
from' the people of that territory. â¢ â¢" Â¦ >â¢

among the several States and foreign nations
Congress had authority to enact the statute
in question.
STATE'S RIGHTS PLEA.
Speaking of the State's rights plea of
the railroad representatives, Justice
Harlan said:
This view does not Impress us. There is no
reason to suppose that Congress had any pur
pose io Interfere with the internal affairs of
the State, nor Is there any ground whatever
for the contention that the anti- trust act regu
lates their domestic commerce.
Justice Harlan brushed aside as
scarcely worth mentioning the conten
tion on the part of the Securities Com
pany that the question involved is the
right of, an individual to dispose of 'his
stock in a State corporation, and that in
such transactions the individuals
whose interests are involved are sub
'ject only to the restraint of State laws.
He also referred to tr~ argument, that
'the position of the Government
amounts to declaring that the owner
ship of stock in a railroad corporation
is in itself interstate commerce and to
other similar declarations and, com
menting on these, he said:
AVc do not understand that the Government
makes any such contentions or tabes any such
positions a* those statements imply. It does
not contend that Congress may control thtt
mere ownership of etoclt in a riiate corporation
engaged In Interstate commerce. It does not
contend that Congress can control the organisa
tion or mere ownership of State corporations,
authorized b- their charters to engage in in
terstate and international commerce. But It
docs contend that Congress may protect the
freedom of interstate commerce by any means
that are appropriate and that are lawful and
not prohibited by the constitution.
CONGRESSIONAL RIGHTS.
' The opinion then takes up the right
of Congress to enact such legislation as
the anti-trust law and goes into an in
quiry as to how far the courts may go
in order to give effect to such an act
and to remedy the evils designed to be
suppressed by it. Justice Harlan said
it was the intention of legislation of
this character to prescribe a rule for
interstate and international commerce
which should prevent vexation by com
binations, conspiracies or monopolies
which restrain commerce by destroying
or restricting- competition. He then
added:
We say that Congress has prescribed such a
rule because in all prior cases in this court
the anti-trust act has been construed as for
bidding any combination which by -Us neces
sary operation destroys or restricts free com
petition among those engaged in interstate
commerce; In other words, that to destroy or
restrict free competition in Interstate com
merce was to restrain such commerce. Now,
can this court, in reason, say that such a
rule is prohibited by the constitution or is not
one that Congress could appropriately prescribe
when exerting its power under the commerce
clause of the constitution?
Taking up the contention that rail
road corporations created under the
laws of a State can be consolidated
only with the authority of that State,
Justice Haiian said that he could not
understand' why this suggestion was
made, in this case. "For," he went on,
"there is no pretense that the combi
nation here in question was under the
authority of the States under which
laws these railroad corporations were
created."
But even if the State allowed consolidation,
it would not follow that the stockholders of
two or more State corporations engaged In ln
terntate commerce could lawfully combine and
form a distinct corporation to bold- the stock
of the constituent corporations and by de
stroying' competition between them restrain
commerce among the States and with foreign
nations.. . Â¦
PRIOU DECISION'.
Justice Harlan announced the in
ability of the. court to concur in the
view.. 1 that the anti-trust act is repug
nant to the constitution of the. United
States. "The contention of the defend
ants," he said, "could not.be sustained
without in effect overruling the prior
decision of this court as to the scope
and validity of the anti-trust act."
Proceeding further, in Â¦ propounding
this line of argument, he said:
' Indeed, if the contentions pf the' defendants
are sound, why not all the railway companies
in the United States that are engaged under
Â£tate charters. In interstate and International
commerce, enter into a combination such as the
one here In question, and, by - the device of a
holding corporation, obtain the absolute con
trol .throughout the entire country _of rates
for passengers and freight beyond the power of
CoiixreHH to protect the public against their ex
actions?; . - .
The argument In behalf of the defendants
necessarily, leads to such results and places Con
gress. I although . invested by the people of the
United States with - full authority to : regulate
Interstate- and International commerce. In a
condition of utter helplessness, , so far as the
protection of the public against such combina
tion Â¦ is concerned. , ' .

the contention that interference by the
Federal Government with the affairs of

Court Finds Against CamHIe Wlden
felil In Minnesota Mercer Case.
ST. PAUL, Minn.. March 14. â A de
cision dismissing the appeal of Ca
mille Weidenfeld from a decree in the
"United States Circuit Court, dismiss
ing the appellant's intervening peti
tion in the case of Peter .Power against
the Northern Pacific Railway ; Com
pany, was handed down by the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals to
day. The suit originated m the Dis
trict Court, Peter Power, as the al
leged owner of 100 shares of common
Stock in the Northern Pacific Com
pany, seeking to obtain an injunction
restraining the Northern Pacific Com
pany's directors from entering into a
combination with similar officers of
the Great Northern and Chicago, Bur
lington and Quincy ronfls to mergo
and consolidate the three systems.
Power ' also sought to restrain the
Northern Pacific Company from re
tiring its preferred stock, alleging that
this was being done in the interest of
the alleged merger. The case was
removed to the United States Circuit
Court, "where the defendants conclu
sively showed that Power never owned
I any stock in the Northern Pacific.
I Camille Weidenfeld, with the per
mission of the court, filed his inter
vening petition seeking to have the
retirement of the stock declared un
lawful and fraudulent and to have the
Northern Pacific Company declared
guilty of having unlawfully consoli
dated its lines with those' of the Great
Northern.
The decision is against the conten
tions of the appellant at every point,
the court holding that the Northern
Pacific Company acted entirely with
in its powers in converting the pre
ferred stock into common stock.
APPEAL IS DISMISSED.
Justices Brewer, Brown* McKenna
and Day concurred in this opinion and
they, with Justice Harlan constituting
a majority of the court, made It the
opinion of the court. Justice Brewer,
however, did not accept the reasoning
of Justice Harlan in all its details and
therefore delivered a brief opinion of
his own. He expressed the opinion that
some of the recent* decisions of the
court in anti-trust cases had gone too
far and, after mentioning several of
them, said:
Instead of holding that the antl-tnist act
included all contracts, reasonable or unrea
Â¦onabte, In restraint of interstate trade, the
rullnr should have been that the contract*
there presented were In themselves unreason
able restrains of Interstate trade, and therefore
The Judgment of. the court is that the decree
below is hereby approved, with liberty to the
Circuit Court, to proceed in the execution of its
decree as the circumstances may require.
BREWER DISSENTS.
Justice Harlan. in conclusion, said
Guided by these long established rules of
construction, it Is manifest that if the anti
trust act is held not to embrace a case such
as is now before us. the plain Intention of the
legislative branch of the Government will bÂ«
defeated. " \ti -t'
Attention also was given to the argu
ment, that the anti-trust act must be
strictly construed in its criminal fea
tures. Quoting a number of authorities
on this subject, Justice Harlan said:
Referring to the decree of the Circuit
Court, Justice Harlan said that no
valid objection could be made to it in
form or in substance.
Discussing the effectiveness of relief
at the hands of the court, he quoted
approvingly the disposal by the Circuit
Court of the point, and continued:
The Circuit Court has done only what the
actual situation demanded. Its decree has
done nothing more than to meet the require
ments of the statute. -^^-
Justice Harlan set aside as fallacious
the argument that the acquisition of
stock by the Northern Securities Com
pany was in the nature of an invest
ment, saying that there had been no
actual investment in any substantial
sense. In this connection, he referred
to Mr. Morgan as authority for the
statement that the stock had been
transferred to the Securities Company
merely for the purpose of suppressing
competition and, in support of this
statement, quoted the testimony of Mr.
Morgan in which he had said that the
Securities Company had been created a
custodian, because ifhad no other alli
ances. ,-.'
FALLACIOUS ARGUMENT.
It is the history of monopolies In this country
and England that predictions of ruin are
habitually made by them when it is attempted
by legislation to restrain their operations ar.d
to protect the public against their exactions.
In this as in former cases, ttiey seek shelter
behind the reserved rights of the States and
the constitutional guarantee of liberty of con
tract. But this, court has heretofore adjudged
that the act of Congress did not touch the
rights of the sJtates and that liberty of contract
did not invofve a right to deprive the public
of the advantages of free competition in trade
and commerce. But. even If the court shared
the gloomy forebodings in which the defend
ants Indulge It could not refuse to respect
the action of the legislative branch of the
â¢Government If what it has done is within
the limits of its constitutional power. The
suggestions of disaster to Business have. we.
apprehend, their origin in the zeal of parties
who arÂ« opposed to the policy underlying the
act of Congress or are interested in the result
of this particular case; at any rate, the sug
gestions imply that the court may and ought to
refuse the enforcement of the provisions of
the act if, in its Judgment. Congress was not
wise in prescribing as a rule by which thÂ«
conduct of interstate and international com
merce is to be governed, that every combina
tion, whatever its form, in restraint of such
commerce and tho monopolizing or attempting
to monopolise such commerce shall be Illegal.
These plainly are questions as to the policy of
legislation which belong to the legislative de
partment, and this court has no function to
supervise such legislation from the standpoint
of wisdom or policy.
Discussing the question as to the
effect of the anti-trust law on financial
interests. Justice Harlan said the pre
diction had been made that disaster to
business and widespread financial ruin
would follow the execution of its pro
visions and," he added, that such pre
dictions had been made in connection
with all preceding Questions under that
act, "but," ' he said, "they have not
been verified." continuing, he said:
DISASTER PREDICTED.
We reject any such views of the relations cf
the national Government and Â»he States com
posing the Union. It cannot be given erect
without destroying the Just authority of the
United States.
Continuing in this line, he said
We cannot conceive how It is possible for any
one seriously to contemplate such a preposi
tion.
Securities Company from exercising its
functions and will be an invasion of
the rights of the State under which
the company was chartered, he said:
If such a. remote result of the exercise of
Â»n ordinary incident of property and personal
freedom l<i ertuigh to make that exercise un
lawful there iÂ» hardly any transaction con
cerning comeierce between the States that
may not be .made a crime by the flodlng of a
Jury or a court.
1 for not agreeing with the majority of
I the court in the decision reached- The
first of these was delivered by Justice
Holmes and the second by Justice
White. Justice Holmes, in his opinion,
contended that the anti-trust statute
is of a criminal nature and said:
It is In rain to Insist that this Is not a
criminal proceeding. The words cannot be
! read onÂ« way in a suit which Is to end In fine
I and imprisonment and another way In onÂ»
which seeks an Injunction. â¢
He conceded, he said, for the pur
pose of discussion that Congress might
take steps not only to regulate com
merce, but also to regulate instruments
of commerce or contracts, the bearing
of which upon commerce would be only
indirect. But the mere fact of an in
direct effect on commerce not shown
to be certain, he argued, would not Jus
tify such a law. Referring to the con
tention as to the effect that acquisition
of the stock of the Great Northern anJ
the Northern Pacific companies would
have in preventing competition be
tween the two roads, Justice Holmea
said:
OTHEU OPINION'S.

White, Peckham and Holmes, present

minor contracts in partial restraint of trada
which the Ions course of decisions at common
law had affirmed were reasonable and ought

ties and remedies to nullify those contracts
! which were !n direct restraint of trade, un
reasonable and asainst public policy. When
ever m departure from common law rules and
definitions Is claimed, the purpose to makÂ»
the departure should be clearly shown. Such
a purriose does not appear and such a de
parture wp.s not intended.
Justice Brewer also held that the
general language ot the act is limited
by the power which the individual has
to manage hi3 own property and deter
mine the place and manner of his in
vestment, v.

A large percentage of Irish jokes,
when they are analyzed, depend upon
a speaker's ignorance or disregard .of
the proper meaning of a word, or upon
the foolhardiness of using a word not
correctly understood. As an instance of
this trait of the'Irish character there is
the following story of a witness. He
was asked by counsel: "Now, my good
man, is not all this you have been say
ing merely an hypothesis?"
"Well," said the witness, "if your
honor says so, I suppose It was."
"Come, now," persisted counsel; "on

"Well, I think I do; it's some part of

He was probabiy thinking of the

would have been so blind to its Incom
patibility with the matter in hand. The
haunting thought comes in again here
as in the consideration of all Irish hu
mor. Was the man really as incongru
ous a fool as he seemed? To assist in
solving, - or still further complicating,
this question two interesting anecdotes
might be set down here on the plea
that if they do not help the reader to
the solution of this subtle question,
they will at least arouse his suspicion.
Judge Burton, a very old and infirm

TACOMA, March 14.â Little doubt
exists that the 'contents of every cargo
being shipped across the Paciflo from
Puget Sound ports are being carefully
ascertained by Russian secret agents
stationed in Tacoma, Seattle and Van
couver. A mysterious person who
speaks a foreign accent when he speaks
at all has been carefully watching 'the
loading of Oriental steamships here for
six weeks past. Shipping men say that
Oriental liners are similarly inspected
in other ports. An officer of the steam
ship Olympia says that her officers
were informed In Yokohama that the
Russian Government had several
agents on Puget Sound.
Three Russians visited United States
Consul Smith in Victoria about two
months ago. They told a "hard luck!'
story and wanted tickets to Seattle.
Later they called and said that they
had met friends who had helped them
out of their difficulty.
The loading of the steamships Peleus,
Lyra and â¢. Hyades was carefully
watched by a man who to-day observed
the unloading of the steamship Ping
Suey. To-morrow this vessel will be
gin reloading for the Orient. In this
manner Russian headquarters some
where, probably in New York, is in
formed of exactly how much flour, lead
and other contraband goods are shipped
to Chinese and Japanese ports.
Eight of the twenty-three wounded
Russians who were taken to the'Mat
suyama Red Cross Hospital are in a
serious condition. Three of them had
both legs amputated by a French sur
geon, but reamputation is now neces
sary. One Russian has 165 wounds,
steel splinters being scattered over his
body. Japanese surgeons are locating
them with Roentgen rays and extract
ing them.
A supplementary report from Vice
Admiral Togo concerning the effort
made by the crews of the Japanese tor
pedo-boat destroyers in action off Port
Arthur on the 10th inst. to rescue th'e
crew of a disabled Russian torpedo
boat destroyer reached here to-day.
Captain Shojiro Asai, commanding the
flotilla of torpedo-boat destroyers, says
that the Japanese would have been able
to rescue many more of the enemy but
for the deadly fire of the shore bat
teries and the close approach of the
Russian cruiser Nqvik. The report also
explains that. four men rescued were
not part of the crew of the Stere
guschtchl, as originally reported.
When the Japanese rescuers reached
the Stereguschtchi only the dead re
mained on, board, and it is believed
that the living members of the crew
jumped overboard and perished in the
sea. Three of the rescued Russians are
engineers and the fourth is a torpedo
operator. Two of the captives were
slightly wounded. They were all placed
on board a Japanese battleship and
were given food and medicine.
Engineer Minamisawa, the heroic of
ficer of the torpedo-boat destroyer Ka
suml, has been signally honored for his
gallantry. He has been given the Or
der of the Kyte and the Order of the
Rising Sun and promoted from engi
neer to chief engineer. The Order of
the Kyte is the Japanese equivalent
of the British Victoria Cross and tho
American medal of honor. Chief Engi
neer Minamisawa is the first to whom
the Kyte has been awarded for hero
ism In war. It is Improbable that he
"will survive his wounds.
TOKIO, March 14.â Viceroy Alexieff's
report stating that a Japanese torpedo
boat destroyer was sunk and the cruis
er Takasago heavily damaged by the
shell fire of the Russians during the
fourth attack on Port Arthur is offi
cially pronounced untrue. The dam
aged Japanese torpedo-boat destroyers
can be repaired in one week and it will
not be necessary to dock them.

A correspondent of a recent edition
of Lloyd's Weekly has expressed his
views of a shio doctor in the following
words: "Many travelers are in doubt
as to the position of the ship's doctor
in regard to his remuneration from
passengers for services rendered. The
merchant shipping act enacts that
every foreign-going vessed having
one hundred persons aboard or up
ward shall carry on board as part of
her complement a duly qualified med
cal practitioner. Furthermore, an
emigrant ship â i. e.. a foreign-going
vessel which carries fifty or more
steerage passengers â must have a
medical man irrespective of the num
ber of the crew or of other pasefgera
carried. The salary of the doctor on
board is commensurate with those
duties to his ship. To any passengers
who are suffering from ordinary
forms of seasickness and its concomi
tant evils or who receive injuries
which are in any way due to the ship,
the doctor's services are free. For any
sickness contracted before sailing or
during a voyage which is not connect
ed, with the above named conditions
he is entitled to a remunration at the
same rate as he would be on shore.
Obviously it would be< as unfair to ex
pect that the services to passengers
should be rendered gratis as it would
be for any visitor in a hotel. or trav
eler on a railway to expect to have
medical attendance free in any illness
for which the hotel or railway au
thorities could not be held respon
sible."
The writer of a letter to the Lancet
says that the case of the ship's surr
geon is stated with accuracy in the
above sentences, and adds that ship's
surgeons are of two kinds â (1) those
who after they have qualified take
such a position either for health or
for pleasure, and (2) those who elect
to make sea life a permanency.
The pay of the ship's doctor varies
from $30 to S50 a month. That Is for
duties to officers and crew. As regards
passengers in relation to the surgeon,
the following groups will include all:
(1) The passenger who takes the in
itiative by remunerating the surgeon
perhaps handsomely for any service
rendered; (2) the passenger who
asks for his bill and pays It If reason
able; (3) the passenger who, travel
ing for the first time, does not know
whether to ask for his bill or wait for
it to be delivered, but Is pleased to be
enlightened on the matter: <4> the
passenger who clings to the old-time
notion that the surgeon Is there solely
for the benefit of passengers, and (5)
the passenger who never intends to
pay the .surgeon. â -Medical Record.

In the course of his conversations in
the train, while traveling from Moscow,
according to this correspondent, Gen
eral Kuropatkin repeated his desire
that peace should be signed only" in
Toklo. The general said that France,
Germany and Austria had agreed with
Russia to prevent Great Britain inter
vening with another Berlin treaty, add
ing:
"We -will never permit Great Britain
to interfere for the purpose of depriving
us of the fruits of a dearly-bought vic
tory. Korea shall be Russian."
PARIS, March 15. â The St. Peters
burg correspondent of the Echo de
Paris says that the Czar's refusal, fol
lowing General Kuropatkin's advice, to
permit Prince Louis Napoleon to go to
the Far East, Is much commented upon.
The correspondent says that six new
torpedo-boats have been sent out of
the Newski yards and that ten others,
modeled after the French torpedo-boat
Cyclone, are being completed and prob
ably will be sent by railway to Port
Arthur.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 14.âGen
eral Zelinsky telegraphed as follows,
under yesterday's date:
"On March 7 our patrol discovered
four of the enemy's posts on the Chong
chengani River and a troop of cavalry
acting as scouts near Patetchen, nojrth
west of Anju. A Japanese cavalry pa
trol fell into an ambuscade prepared by
our patrol and were dispersed, losing
one killed. The Japanese left behind
them a quantity of guncotton and some
swords and blankets.
"The population of Manchuria Is
quiet. On the night of March 11 the
.enemy's ships explored Helena Bay and
the shore opposite Senutchlno with
searchlights. According to information
which has been verified, the Japanese
have not made any attacks north of
Gensan. The population along the Tu
men River is favorable to us."
When the Japanese closed on the
Russians the sailor sprang aboard the
enemy's vessel and met hter comman
der emerging from the cabin. Sailor
and captain sprang at one another, but
the Japanese was the quicker of the
two and felled the Russian officer by
striking him on the head with a cut
lass. The Russian endeavored to rise,
but the Japanese sailor kicked him
overboard and he was drowned.
The Japanese say there were twenty
two dead on the two Russian destroy
ers.
. The report of the death of Engineer
Mlnamisawa was premature, but he can
scarcely recover.
The Japanese dead were landed at
Sasebo and received with full military
honors. They were borne on gun car
riages to the naval brigade headquar

Mr. Sheppard began with a brief re
view of the growth of Russian power
during the last six centuries. "Taking
Moscow as a center of national life,"
h<Â» paid, "we find that Russian ex
pansion has been connected with two
great movements: her eastward ad
vance toward China, Manchuria and
Korea, and her southward advance to
ward Turkey, Persia and India." This
expansion was explained clearly in its
f-alk-nt historical facts, especial em
j>hasis being laid on the ancient Rus
sian policy of conquering and then ab
sorbing the wandering nomad tribes of
foes who harassed the Muscovite
jtowcr. ThiP. the speaker declared, had

last night before the Chit-Chat Club by
Eli T. Shej>rard. lung in the United
States consular service In China and
for many years the adviser of the Japa
ne5e Government la matters of Interna
tional law. Horace Davis, president of
the club, presided, and nearly 100 mem
bers listened to the address with the
deepest interest. Mr. Sheppard's life
long study of Oriental questions gave
his utterances the vrelsht of authority,
and his care in citing established his
torical facts as the basis of his deduc
tions marked him as a trustworthy and
conservative guide in a field that is
Just now much obscured by prejudice,
JCevcrtheless the speaker showed
himself no lover of Russia. While pay
ing due attention to the overmastering
skill of Russian diplomacy and the un
faltering determination with which the
agents of the great White Czar have
substituted order for chaos in their
Asiatic conquests, he pointed out the
long course of duplicity by which her
diplomats have tightened Russia's grip
upon these dominions, first established
by ruthless murder and rapine. Accord
ing to this expert in international law
there is no crime so foul that Russia
has not committed It in her progress
into Southern and Eastern Asia, no
pledge she has not repeatedly broken,
no falsehood so base that she has not
brazenly proclaimed It the truth, until
the facts disclosed her treachery to all
the world, when her familiar excuse
had been that "honesty is inerely rela
tive"â!n other words, that all is fair in
the international game.
THE RUSSIAN ADVANCE.
"There was no disputing the plaus
ibility and even the correctness of this
contention. Russia was only setting
up the lesson the Western powers had
imposed upon her at the Congress of
Berlin in 1879. But it took the world
two years to find out that she played
her game with a 'joker' up her sleeve.
It knows now that at the very moment
the Russian diplomatists were protest
ing so righteously against the dismem
berment of China, they were actually
in possession of the Cassini secret con
vention, by which China had practi
cally given to Russia a free hand In
the whole of Manchuria.
"The official text of this convention
has never been published and never
will be, for the reason . that the wjiole
episode is tainted with a moral obliq
uity and conscious duplicity that even
a Russian diplomatist would be asham
ed to confess. It is known, however,
that Russia undertook to obtain thÂ»
recession from Japan of the Liaotung
peninsula and to support China againct
further aggressions In consideration of
certain exclusive treaty rights in Man
churia. ','.':)>' '.'â¢''Â»â¢
"The scope of the Casslnl convention
has since been enlarged, notably by the
conventions of 1896 and 1898, both of
which were conducted in secret . and
both of which were repeatedly denied
officially by Russia after tHey had been
signed. The remarkable feature of all
these conventions is that in addition to
the exclusive railway, banking and
mining privileges secured by Russia, a
palpable injustice is inflicted- on all
other nations. It was provided, among
other things, that all goods and mer
chandise imported from Russia over
the Siberian railway should pay one
third less duty than that imposed at
the open treaty ports. This introduced
the principle of differential tariffs Into
Chinese commerce in direct violation
of the treaty rights of Japan and all
the other treaty powers. Yet on six
separate occasions since 1901 the Rus
sian Government has officially and sol
emnly declared that Manchuria would
be entirely restored to China and that
Russia had no Intention to acquire an
actual or virtual protectorate over
Manchuria or Korea or to annex any
part of their territories. In the face of
these facts. Russia is now asking the
sympathy of the western nations on
the ground that hers Is a Christian
Government, forced to defend herself
against a pagan power."
THE CASSINI TREATY.
In \*iew of the present war, a large
part of Mr. Sheppard's able paper was
naturally given to the story of Rus
sia's relations with China and the
steps by which she has gradually
fastened her hold upon Manchuria, His
narrative began with Peter the Great's
treaty with China, reserving the Amur
provinces to the latter nation. "The
influence of his name was so powerful,"
said the speaker, "that for a century
and a half Russian statesmen kept
their hands off these regions, but the
Crimean War was followed by their
seizure in defiance of the faith of na
tions, at the very moment when China
was in the throes of the Taiping re
bellion and unable to defend herself. .
"The results of the war between
China and Japan in 1S94 took the Rus
sians by surprise. They realized that
if Japan got herself firmly established
in the Liaotunar peninsula, the Russian
advance into Manchuria and their de
s5g:n of Oriental dominion would be
indefinitely postponed. But Russia was
then unprepared to attack Japan. So
she entered upon a course of consum
mate duplicity without parallel In mod
ern history. She took the lead In pro
testing against the occupation of
Korea and the Llaotung peninsula by
Japan, on the ground that it would
disturb the Integrity of China and the
Asiatic balance of power.
" 'Sire, your Majesty's order reached
me in the heart of that city which I
now have the honor to place at your

aggressive and resistless action at the
front. If these aggressions succeed,
then the Czar's ministers tell the world
that they are now accomplished facts
and the honor of Russia will not per

the Government disavows and dishon
ors the offending officers as evidence
to the world of the immaculate purity

"The two great factors In the Rus

"Just as General Cherniev was about
to advance on Tshkent, .the capital of
Turkestan, he received an order from
St. Petersburg to withdraw his expe

The St. Petersburg Zeitung asserts
that the proclamation leaves no fur
ther doubt that the United States has
a firm intention to observe strict neu
trality, and adds:
"It bears the stamp of strong and
most distinguished personality."
The other papers also make a display
this morning of the denials of the
Newchwang reports that the United
States intended to support the protest
of the commander of the United States
gunboat Helena against the plan of
the Russian authorities to sink Junks
at the entrance of the Lao River, evi
dently considering that this puts an
end to the statement which caused a
flurry here yesterday, and that further
comment is unnecessary. VÂ» "

ST. PETERSBURG, March 14.â
There is no truth in the rumors that

Commission on Far Eastern Affairs,

He says the situation at Port Arthur

President Roosevelt's recent procla

Japan or Russia has produced a great
impression here. The newspapers this

commending the substance and spirit
of the proclamation in the highest

unreservedly as a complete answer to
the charges that the American Govern
ment is hostile to Russia; and declares
that hereafter, despite any seemingly
untoward incident which may arise, it
will be considered settled once and for
all, "that- the American Government

An official statement that none of the Japanese warships was seriously damaged in the recent bat
tle off Port Arthur lias been issued in Toldo. J ci-- : Â«
Twenty thousand additional Chinese troops are on the way to guard the Mahchurian border, accord
ing to a dispatch from Xewchwang. Preparations to hold Xewchwang continue,. but. the opinion is held
that the Russians will abandon the town on the approach of the Japanese and wait until 300,000 men
are mobilized before beginning an active campaign. . Japanese rumors that the Russians had abandoned
Port Arthur were officially denied.
It is reported by a British correspondent that the Russian admiral, 3Iakaro'ff, has himself blockaded
the entrance to the harbor at Port Arthur, with the Russian fleet on the outside, and that he will assume
the aggressive against the Japanese fleet. â¢
Russian private advices admit that Port Arthur was badly damaged in the recent bombardment. It
is added that a state of siege is to be proclaimed in Russian seaports as a precautionary measure during
the movements of troops and ships.
From Seoul comes confirmation of the report received previously from several sources that the
Japanese lost a cruiser in the battle with the Russian warships Variag and Koreitz at the outbreak of the
war. A sunken warship lies in the mud flats near the entrance to the harbor of Chemulpo and not far

BERLIN. March 14. â In the Reich
stag to-day, before the order of the
day was taken up. Dr. Steubel, Di
rector of the Colonial Office, an
nounced the receipt of a cable message
from Colonel Leutwein, Governor of
German Southwest Africa, saying that
800 cavalry, with two mounted bat
teries, were indispensable for subduing
the Hereros, of whom fÂ»000 were un
der arms and still occupying strong
position on the line. of the railroads.
A bill providing these reinforcements
will' be introduced in the House as
soon as it can be prepared.
The House applauded a political eu
logy of President Cleveland by Pat
terson of Tennessee, and a moment
later a eulogy of the late President
McKinley, also by Patterson. Cleve
land, he said, had not hesitated to lis
ten to political and other advice from
the South and McKinley had done
much to heal the breach between the
North and the South. â¢ â¢ Â¦
"Although President Cleveland made
mistakes," declared Patterson, "he cer
tainly did not make them against the
interests of the South, and whatever
mistakes he made were like specks on
the sun compared to his great char
acter, his true Americanism and his
unblemished honor."
The blight of the fifteenth amend
ment to the constitution. had reversed
the previous great record of the South
in producing Presidents, but Patterson
expressed the belief that a Democratic
nominee from the South would not lose
a single electoral vote to the party.
HÂ« mentioned John G. Carlisle, Rep

Bailey as possible candidates.

letter from F. H. Cunningham,, presi

carriers. Crumpacker said that he was
not opposed to increasing the salaries
of carriers, but he believed this a ful
fillment of the prophecy of ex-Repre

would organize a powerful machine and

unexpected formation of a new polit

political affairs.
Non-Mormons, who are indignant at
the testimony of President Smith and
the admissions made before the Smoot
investigating committee, met here to
day with the avowed purpose of form
ing a new party. A committee of twen
ty-five citizens was appointed to frame
a plan of political action, and a mass
meeting will be held next week to ratify
the action and perfect organization. A
protest against the statements of Presi
dent Smith was unanimously adopted
and was at once forwarded to Chair
man Burrows of the investigating com
mittee, and copies will be circulated for
further signatures in Utah and adjoin
ing States.
The resolutions declare that the law
abiding citizens repudiate emphatically
the statement of President Smith that
his offense of living in open polygamy
is condoned; that, on the contrary, the
disclosures made by him at Washing
ton were nowhere received with greater
amazement, indignation and disgust
than In Utah; that it has been hereto
fore impossible to get at the real facts
of the situation owing to the wall of
secrecy with which, the polygamlsts
have surrounded themselves and their
constant practice of failing to comply
with the law in reporting births. The
protest conclude? with the demand that
law-breaking in Utah be brought to an
end and that the State keep its pledge
to the United States.

But the Hepbyrn-Dolliver bill is en
tirely different, and it is just as well to
clear any confusion resulting from the
Hepburn name. The measure is
fathered In the House by Mr. Hepburn
and in the Senate by Dolliver of Iowa.
Should it become a law it would em
power any State to stop the importa
tion of California wines, as well as all
other liquors, across its borders. It is
an Iowa measure â an attempt on the
par^ of that State to do away with the
liquor traffic as it is carried on "in the
original package." Iowa has a prohibi
tion law. Liquor being sent to pur
chasers living within that State from
dealers in other States, action was
brought and the State Supreme Court
said it was unlawful. The United
States Supreme Court reversed this
ruling, holding that, except as checked
by act of Congress, interstate com
merce was free. In 1S90 the Wilson bill
was passed to give the State the right
to prevent the sale of liquor in the orig
inal package. The bill failed of the de
sired effect â that is, to keep liquor out
of the State â for while it became un
lawful to transfer title to the "original
package" by sale, it was still lawful to
deliver to the consignee, and the num
ber of consignees simply multiplied.
The intent of the Hepburn-Dolllver
bill is to enable the Legislature of any
State to forbid by law the. importation
of liquor. Under its provisions a State
may stop at the line and confiscate any
wines or. other liquors consigned to an
individual within its borders, and may
regulate the importation otherwise by
levy of taxes.
The House Judiciary Committee, to j
which the bill was referred, has listened
with patience for many days to argu
ments on both sides. Temperance or
ganizations have called orators for the
purpose from long distances and many
directions throughout the United
States. Brewers' organizations and,
ethers have spoken against the bill. A
number of women have spoken on both
sides. Dr. Mary Walker and Phoebe

hearings have been enlivened by
charges made by opponents- of the bill

Special Dispatch to. The Call
Captain Daniels has introduced a new
bill touching the Colorado River irriga
tion question. It sets out as a fact
that the water is more valuable for
irrigation than for navigation purposes
and legalizes the appropriation that has
been made of the water already by
irrigation companies and admits the
same right in the future to any to
which it is accorded by the States or
Territories through which the 'river
flows. This makes a general proposi
tion of what was directed to the bene
fit of a single company and will at
least Â¦ eliminate some ground of oppo
sition on the part of the geological sur
vey. The water of the river is nearly
all employed in irrigation now and a
large part of its use for this purpose
is in Mexico, it being carried some dis
tance through that country by way of
finding grade and thence back into
California. Some Interesting questions
will develop in the consideration of the
bill. ~<,%:^ .
"That remark of his," adds Chaplain

CALIFORNIA'S PATRON AGE./
The failure of Senator Bard's essay
at harmony in the California delega
tion with regard to the distribution of
Federal patronage is the occasion of
many a wry face among its members.
The way seemed entirely clear to a
certain arrival at satisfactory nomina
tions to fill future vacancies. The po
sition taken by Senator Perkins will
ca'rry the matter over until next ses
sion. No great importance attaches to
this, he says, as there are no appoint
ments pending save those which Sen
ator Bard.ieserved. The argument is
made, however*, that for this reason the
time is opportune for arriving at an
agreement covering the future and be
fore any contention has arisen over the
filling of vacancies.. JVevertheless many
admit the strength c-f Senator Perkins
position in the matter, while regretting
the possible effect on the strength of
the delegation. .';.:;
Colonel Harvey Scott, is in the city
looking after the appropriation for the
Lewis and Clark Exposition of Port
land, of which he is president. The
disposition in the House is to cut the
appropriation down. The original bill
was for two millions national appro
priation. The Senate cut it only to
$1,775,000. The House committee talks
of allowing only $500,000. It was hear
ing of this that brought Mr. Scott
across the continent again after hav
ing gone home with the impression that
the fight was won. He says he is will
ing to compromise on a million, but
that if the nation is to be represented
at all it should not offer less than this,
considering the historical importance
of the event being celebrated as well
as the importance geographically of
the proposed exposition."
Edward Everett Hale, chaplain of the
Senate, thinks that there is a place in
history for a certain young sailorman
if his name can be learned, and he is
prosecuting an inquiry in which he has
enlisted Senator Foster of Washington.
In a letter dated March 4 addressed to
the Senator he says:
"When Commodore Perry opened the
ports of Japan the Japanese Govern
ment had in prison a young fellow from
Washington Territory who had <â¢ been
shipwrecked on their coast. He was
in prison only because he was a for
eigner. They were cross-examining
him, and asked him %vhat officers of
our Government held higher rank than
the men they knew. He said the offi
cers c-f the navy had to obey the Sec
retary of the Navy, and that he was
under the President. They asked him
who was greater than the President.
This boy said, 'The people is greater
than the President'; and in giving the
account of this afterward he said, 'Of
this they could make nothing.'
OKEGOX'S EXPOSITION.
It was question and answer like this
that kept interest in the Inquiry keyed
to a high pitch.
"Yes; he accepted it as a fact â but
he did not know it."
"You say that in your missionary
work, you teach only the plain princi
ples of Vyour doctrine and avoid the
mysteries?"
"Yes."
"Is polygamy one of the mysteries
of the doctrine?"
"It would be considered so now."
man said that Senator Smoot did not
know that he (Lyman) had a plurality
of wives.
"Did the people generally of Salt
Lake know that you had a number of
wives?"
"They accented it as a fact."
"Did Apostle^ Smoot accept it as a
fact?"

typical of a large part of the productions of the genius of the prolific poet-painter.' It is one of
the best known of thiÂ§ famous painter's canvases, the original bringing $25,000 at public sale in .
Â¦"s. .71881. It possesses the poetic inspiration, the refined and delicate color and the concise expression
of the essential elements of the beauty of landscape which distinguished him as the greatest land-
scape painter the sworld has yet known.
It is no wonder that the art of !orot was great. He possessed so kind and lovable a nature
that he endeared himself to every one who knew him. "Papa Corot" was the sobriquet \which men,
of his own profession bestowed upon him. While he was not a man^ of much educataion, he pos- V
sessed a great fund of that native intelligence which we call common sense, and considerable busi- ,
ness ability. . - â¢
His untiring industry resulted in the production of a quantity of work which is most extra- '
ordinary considering his uniform success in attaining his high aim. The -fleeting and uncertain ! : - ; vÂ£
.â¢effects of light and air were seized by him and reproduced in a most limited range of values and ..
the narrowest possible gamut of color. With delicate grays, greens, pale violet," yellow and salmon
tints he produced harmonies into which he threw a vibrant force by a touch of vermillion Â¦ and a
few positive notes of brown and black. â¢ ' - Â¦ r . â¢ '
Jean Baptiste Camile Corot was born in Psris in 1796. He received bis early educaticn. in â¢
Rouen, and became apprenticed to a cloth merchant in Paris when quite young. When 36 years
of age he begin his art studies in the studio of Michallon, and the next year entered the studio
of Victor Bertin. In 1827 he first exhibited in the Salon. Recognition came slowly, but by the time
he reached the age of 70 he had amassed a considerable Tortune. He received a second-class medal
in 1833; and a first in 1848. In 1874 a special gold medal was struck and presented to him by his.
fellow artists as a token of their esteem. He was made a chevalier of the Legion of Honor- in
1846, and promoted to the grade of officer in 1867. He died February 22, 1875.

GRUNSKY IS BANQUETED
BY FOR3IER ASSOCIATES
! R. L. Myrlck, a ticket collector at
the Oakland mole, was as positive as
Reardon that White is not a square
man. "I would not trust him under
oath," said Myrick.
' Myrick was a little bit puzzled by
the attorney's questions concerning
White reputation' for honesty. He
said he never had any dealings with
him in "dollars and cents," but he felt
certain any one with the alleged gen
eral reputation of White was not much
when it came to honesty. He proved
a most voluble' witness on the ques
tion of veracity, however, denouncing
White in strong language. f
"He lied about me'," he said,- "at a
time when I was about to secure a po
sition -he coveted. , He , said I was
drunk, when I had nothing to drink
but a bottle of. patent medicine that I
had taken for a co!4.''
The case will go on again to-day.
The discussion of White's reputation
was brought about by a suit filed
against White by Fred M. Boehm, ad
ministrator of the estate of Daniel
Boehm, who for years ran the restau
rants on the river steamers owned by
the Southern Pacific. The suit Is for a
sum approximating $3500, which Boehm
claims his uncle, the restaurant man.
Intrusted to White a short time prior to
his death, and which he says White has
not accounted for. White does not deny
receiving the money from Boehm at the
time specified, but he claims that it
was given to him outright as a .gift,
and the testimony showed that during
the last days of Boehrn's life the rail
road official had performed many acts
of kindnesses for him.
John Joseph Reardon, an employe
of the railroad company, was the first
witness examined concerning WWte's
reputation for truth, honesty and
integrity. He gave it as his opinion
that White was a "bad egg" and said
that there were any number of men
in the employ of the railroad and else
where that would say as much. He
testified that a Captain Freeman told
him he would not believe White un
der oath; that Howard Holmes,- for
merly chief engineer of the Harbor
Commissioners, had told him that
White was not to be trusted, and Paris
Kilburn, former president of ' ' the
Board of; Harbor Commissioners, had
eaid that White was not trustworthy.
He also said that one Johnson, once
chief engineer on the steamer Herald,
had denounced White In unmeasured
terms.
Under cross-examination he ad
mitted that he once had a little trouble
with White, but he said, "I am not
in the least hostile toward him."
Reardon said further that one Count
Van Lobensehl, who had trouble with
White over a wharf, did not like the
assistant superintendent. He said the
Count's opinion of White was. not {It
for publication or for expression in a
courtroom.. "He gave it to me," said
the' witness, "one foggy morning on
the mole. 1 '

BOE11M BRINGS SUIT.
The reDutation of Kellogg A. White,
assistant suDerintendent of steamers of
the Southern Pacific Company, was un
der discussion in Judge Sloss' court
yesterday. Several witnesses pro
nounced it decidedly bad, not only for
truth, but for t honesty and integrity,
and thev were not a bit backward in
announcing that almost every one that
came in contact with White had no
scruples In informing the public at
large that the Southern Pacific official
was everything that he should not be.
Strange to relate, these witnesses are
all In the employ of the Southern Pa
cific, holding positions more or less sub
ject to the influence of the man whose
reputation they assailed. Their testi
mony, however, was qualified by the
fact, brought out during their cross
examination, that at some time in their
careers as railroad employes they had
had trouble with White.
Lieutenant Dolie M. Metcalfe, Phil
ippine scouts, registered at headquar
ters on leave.
Colonel Owen J. Sweet is still con

The funeral of the late Captain
James E. Brett, retired, who died at
the State Military Institute in Okla
homa, took place yesterday afternoon
at the Presidio. He was burled In the
National Cemetery at the post with
military honors. The Sixtieth Com
pany of Coast Artillery acted as escort.
The caisson upon which the remains
Â¦were borne to their last resting place
â¢was drawn by six magnificent black
horses. \ \
The transport Dix is now scheduled
to sail for the Philippines on March
25. She Â¦will take the 210 mules now
â¢waiting at the Presidio and a hold full

Colonel Xoble of the Tenth Infantry
for the establishment of a court-mar

days. Lieutenant Colonel Edwin B.
Bolton Â¦will be president of the board.
Major R. C. Van Vleit and" Captain
Frank L. Winn, who have been trying
to locate a target range on the line of
the Southern Pacific, have returned.
Their report has been handed to Gen
eral MacArthur, who will later decide
upon which of the different sites is
most available. It was reported that
several sites are named in the report,
all having more or less advantages, so
in all probability the suggested Baker
cite â¢will be abandoned.
Several of the first and second lieu
tenants in command of the scouts were
formerly enlisted men and were ap
pointed to their commands from the
constabulary, having shown unusual
proficiency in the service.
The transport Thomas, which arrived
late last night from Manila brought

"We had most any kind of a wind
that could blow," said Lieutenant
Howell. "It started In with a south
easter, and we had It all around to the
southwest. The high wind was accom
panied by an extremely heavy sea.
After midnight Tuesday we had the
lowest barometer known in some time.
It was 2S.40. Captain Tuttle has been
on this coast for over twenty years,
and he never experienced as low a
barometer. When the barometer fell so
low we looked for most anything. We
were four days and a half getting down
here. We spoke several ships en route,
but saw none in distress."
SAUSALITO, March 14.â The United
States revenue cutter Manning Is lying
off Sausalito after an extremely rough
voyage down from Puget Sound. The
Manning left Seattle 'on Saturday,
March 6, and was five days In making
the trip to San Francisco. Captain
Tuttle says It was by far the roughest
trip he has ever experienced up or down
this coast. The Manning was In the
storm that raged last Tuesday night.

and thera was no cessation for many
hours. The boat braved the gale from
10 o'clock Tuesday night until 4 o'clock

was damaged slightly.
.Captain Tuttle was not aboard the
Manning to-day, but other officers of
the ship recounted their experiences.

Since the attachment was placed on
all the mining property by the mer
chants of Plumas County residing In
Quincy, a suit has been .filed by E. A.
Belcher and Attorney Kirk of the San
Francisco Board of Trade, represent
ing the San Francisco creditors. Bel
cher said yesterday that unless some
thing Is done the San Francisco cred
itors will not get anything for their
mining machinery and other supplies
that were furnished. .'!.;"%â¢
.If the Plumas County- creditors do
not do the fair thing a suit will be filed
to throw the mining company into in
voluntary bankruptcy.
Mr. Belcher said he did not have a
list of creditors. In other quarters it
was learned that among the San Fran
cisco parties concerned as creditors for
mining machinery and other appliances
supplied to the mine are the Dunham,
Carrigan & Hayden Company, the
Joshua Hendy Machine Works, the
California Powder Works, the Boston
"Woven Hose and Rubber Company, the
Schaw-Batch'er Company, the Pacific
Tank Company and the Meese &
Gottfried Company. Attorney Kellogg
of Quincy Is looking after San Fran
cisco interests at the Plumas end of the
line, while Messrs. Belcher and Kirk
are attending to matters here.
Certain of the parties concerned say
that the contractors, McGill & Stand
art, were put in charge of the mine to
represent Douglas. Lacey & Co. A rep
resentative of Douglas, Lacey & Co.,
Walter W. Vick, Is in this city.- He
contradicts some of the statements that
have been made by Lawton. The San
Francisco creditors seem to have com
plete confidence In Lawton. . A great
deal of litigation is likely to grow out
of the transaction.
CREDITORS PILE SUIT.
To have the story understood, some
history of the mining company involved
is given. The Plumas mine was origin
ally owned by the Plumas Gold Mining
Company. That was capitalized with
1,000,000 shares of stock. The mine has
a large ledge that carries low grade ore
ranging in value from $2 to $3 per ton,
according to assayers* returns. To make
It pay largely, it was deemed, wise by
the original company to put in a large
milling equipment that it might, after
the maner of the famous Treadwell
mining property in Alaska, make a
great deal of money by handling large
quantities of ore.
W. D. Lawton was managing the
property. He went to New York to In
terest outside capital, it being neces
sary to raise more money than could
be obtained by the sale of the stock in
California. Douglas. Lacey & Co. of
New York financed the matter. A new
corporation was formed that Is named
the Plumas Gold Mining Company,
Limited. The stock was divided into
5,000,000 shares. More or less of thia
stock has been sold In the East. In the
deals that concerned the mining prop
erty, McGill & Standart, contractors,
were involved. To them the sum" of
$6000 was due as an installment on a
debt. When the default occurred In the
payment of this $6000, the mine was lost
to the company. Douglas, Lacey & Co.,
who financed the deal, did not come to
the rescue. Before this took place Mr.
Lawton had lost his position with the
company. - Since then he has. made cer
tain statements about the entire trans
action that make the San Francisco
creditors, and possibly the investors in
the stock of the company, curious to
know Mow, with a good mine in sight,
with many thousands of dollars In
vested in new equipments. In default
of an actual run of ore through the
mill to show what the ore was. worth
v.hen It was handled, the property was
permitted to go for $6000. ' *
Within the last year the mine owned
by the company, in Plumas County,
has been equipped with forty stamps
and a large amount of mining ma
chinery. The equipment and supplied,
the latter being furnished by Plumas
County merchants, while the former
came from San Francisco, represent an
outlay of $50,000, the greater part of
which is due in this city. The indebt
edness was not paid, even in part. To
secure themselves, the Plumas mer
chants have filed a first attachment on
all the company's property. This leaves
the San Francisco merchants to lose all
that they have trusted the company
for, unless an agreement can be reach
ed Â¦with 'the business men of Plumas
to prorate, or unless legal proceedings
shall right matters. A suit is threat
ened with probable disclosures con
cerning very interesting phases of the
deal that has led the company to giva
up a property that Is Intrinsically valu
able and that has on It at least $40,000
worth of entirely new equipment, to
be sacrificed by reason of the default
In a payment of only $6000 that wa3
due as an installment.
HISTORY OF COMPANY.
San Francisco business men and their
attorneys suspect that there has been
sharp practice in. a mining deal by
which, on the face of affairs, they stam!
to lose $40,000. Not long ago the Plumad
Gold Mining Company, Limited, allow
ed Its valuable property to go out of its
possession Into the ownership of par
ties to whom the sum of only $6000 was
due.
The First Congregational Church of
Petaluma, of which the' Rev. Samuel
C. Patterson is pastor, closed a con
tract yesterday with a California organ
company for a patent pneumatic or
gan to cost $3500. The instrument is to
have fifteen speaking stops, fourteen
mechanical actions and 811 pipes. It
will be installed for the third Sunday
in August.
The executive committee of the San
Francisco Missionary Convention, to
take place in the city next month, and
for which big preparations are being
made, met yesterday afternoon at the
Methodist Book Concern building, Dr.
G. B. Smyth in the chair.
Arrangements were made to hold
meetings beginning Thursday evening,
April. 28, to be continued Friday all
day, Saturday morning and evening
and Sunday in the afternoon. In addi
tion to the meetings in the city, which
will be held in the Alhambra Theater,
there will in all probability be meet

The preparation of the day-school teacher is
In thÂ» normal school; the preparation of the
Sunday school teacher should be In her closet.
The day-school teacher feels her work finished
If she turns out a merely respectable and pass
ably int?lllgent product; the Sunday school
teacher can only feel her work done when she
sees her pupil close to thÂ« feet of, our Saviour.
PREPARE FOR CONVENTION.
I fear that harm Is sometimes done In Im
pressing on our church members the necessity
of special training as Sunday school teachers,
and leaving them to suppose that we mean the
training given our day-school teacher. -
Of course, wo should not overlook the general
laws of pedagogy, but do not frighten away our
teachers by Uflng the term.
Some of our teachers seemed afraid to even
mention a Ood. The thought of a loving: and
personal God Is far from the minds of even
our Christ- professing: teachers; far from their
minds, because of the fear of a claim that
they are teaching sectarian doctrines.
We hear our schools cpoken of as godless
and too frequently, I fear, they are and. there
fore, the more the neÂ«d of our Sunday schools.
The public school educator falls short In his
effort, because. In attempting to develop char
acter, he must, under our laws, and fre
quently following his own inclination, omit
that most essential phase of cbaractar-devel
opment. the spiritual.
Mr. Kingsbury said in part:
"The Public School and the Sunday-
School" was the theme of a paper read
by W. Kingsbury before the Methodist
Minislers' Association yesterday at
Epworth Hall.
While it did not seem to him that
an employer should say that a man
should not belong to a labor union, he
admitted that independent labor suf
fered through the unions. Mr. Collins
believed that all men should have^equal
rights and opportunity.
He illustrated the case where a man
was not permitted to employ hl9 own
son as an apprentice a.nd stigmatized
some union labor methods as usurpa
tion and slavery, but he asked If it
would be a bettlement of the troubles
if employers on the other hand adopt
the method of the "lockout."
The Rev. H. B. Mowbray addressed
the meeting bii "Our Work in the Sun
day-School." and took occasion to crit
icize the old methods while giving pre
ference for a modern pedagogic system.
PUBLIC AND SUNDAY SCHOOLS.
As the employers had taken that step
there was, he said, a resort to extreme
measures on both sides.
Mr. Collins referred to the Citizens'
Alliance and the work of Mr. Parry
of Indianapolis, whose association, he
understood, had been Instrumental in
righting labor troubles at the mines In
Idaho.
The lockout, he said, which had been
inaugurated in Oakland in a small way
might be a criterion by which future
troubles in labor might be determined.
ADVOCATES EQUAL. RIGHTS.
Out of an address on "International
Arbitration" delivered before the Pres
byterian Ministers' Association <Â»y D.
Edward Collins at the Presbyterian
House yesterday arose a discussion
dealing .with the labor situation In
America and the Citizens' Alliance.
Mr. Collins' subject was originally
devoted to war, the* settlement of in
ternational disputes, the great service
to humanity and nations rendered by
the Hague arbitration tribunal and the
anticipation of the great powers re
ducing or abolishing their vast armies
and navies. . Â¦* .
At the close of the address the Rev.
Mr. Bevler and the Rev. Dr. Strong
expressed the hope that Mr. Collins
might have dealt with arbitration also
as It would affect the labor problems
of the moment.
"Lockouts" and "strikes" were then
discussed, Mr. Collins reminding his
audience that he considered the action
of the Oakland butchers lH "locking
out" their employes quite as serious
as the stand of strikers and labor
unions that called out men and pre
vented them from accepting employ
ment.

of Mrs. Laura Campbell against her
husband, L. D. Campbell, whom she
had arrested for an alleged assault,
upon his mother-in-law, Mrs. H. Cut
ter, Police Judge George Samuels de
cided yesterday that Mrs. Campbell
could not testify against her husband,
owing to the fact that she had been
granted only an interlocutory decree
of divorce and not a final decree.
Attorney W. H. O'Brien, represent
ing Campbell, raised an objection to
Mrs. Campbell testifying upon the
ground that under the law she was
still married and therefore legally
barred from testifying against her
husband without his consent The de
cision of the Judge is in-line with the
recent decision of the Supreme Court.

The separating-house was, of course,
utterly destroyed and the washing
house, . a hundred yards away,
was telescoped so "that it will
have to be rebuilt entirely. All that
remained on the scene of the separat
ing-house was a hole in the ground
ten feet deep and seventy feet In diam
eter, a few piles and stanchions and
some water. All around was devasta
tion and debris. The eucalyptus trees
near by were stripped of all their
limbs and leaves, the leaves themselves
being split into pieces. There was not
a stick of whole timber about the place
and wherever there was a splinter, it
was buried a foot or two in the ground.
The bodies, of poor Jackson and
Pepin were nowhere to be found by the
men that searched the ruins afterward.
They had been pulverized, like the in
animate things that once made part of
the separating-house, , The utmost
that could be discovered of any, part of
the men's bodies was a piece of scalp
not much larger than a dollar.. This
was identified as a portion of the body
of Jackson by his brother, Arthur
Jackson, who recognized the color of
the hair that still, clung to lt-
Exactly what caused the explosion
will never be known, as the only men
that could give explanation/ bore
the secret with them to death. ..There
are a number of theories advanced, but
none that Beem to fit the -case.' About
the most plausible is_ that the acid with
which the men were/working caught
fire and got so ; far beyond, their -contAu
that It went off. The officials: at the
plant say, however, "that the. men | were
too inexperienced to let, such- a thing
occur, though they do not advance; any
other theory to take the place of this
discarded one.
It is certain, however, and it was'
OAKLAND, March 14.â Tons upon
tons of nitro-glycerln exploding at the
Giant Powder Works plant at Giant,
Contra Costa County, to-day crushed
out the lives of two men and so badly
wounded another that he had to submit
to the amputation of his left foot. The
dead are Farrer Jackson and John
Pepin, workmen in the separating
house at the plant; the wounded man
is Ben Schartau, foreman of the mix
ing-house. All of the men were trusted
employes and had been in the com
pany's service for years.
In addition to the loss of life and the
wounds the explosion caused great de
struction of property. This loss of prop
erty is not so much expressed in dollars
and cents as it is more apparently in
the number of buildings /shattered and
the area affected. The buildings may
not have cost more than $5000, but this
represents the cost of two buildings, a
large amount of glass and other things.
Considering the amount of explosive
involved, the damage is not so great as
it might have been. There have. been
explosions of the same amount of nitro
glycerin that affected places much
more distant. The damage from the ex
plosion at Giant is confined to the pre
cincts of the town. This is due largely
to the nature of the building in which
the explosion occurred, it being so
firmly built and walled about that the
concussion was kept within bounds.

tom, I had gone to , the 'separating

was left there. / I stopped a minute
and v then; went on.^but I hadn't got far

.^Schartau'8 left leg was mangled just
above, the ankle. Otherwise he was
not hurt and when assistance arrived
he , was taken to the Giant Company's
officei There hei showed his bravery
and nerve by sitting up and smoking a
pipe, while waiting for the doctors to
come from Point Richmondi five miles
away. , /
Aloud, sharp report, followed by the
crash of timbers and then silence, told
the story of disaster to the .inhabitants.
Some said afterward that they felt as
if 'all the -atmosphere had suddenly
drawn away and then rebounded. Some
felt as if the roofs were about to be
pulled off their houses and all were
frightened by the \ crash of glass. As
soon as it wa3 all over a rush was
â¢made ; for the scene of the tragedy,
,wives and children all thinking of loved
ones who might have been caught and
killed instantly.
The first sight that met their eyes
was Schartau, who was lying on the
hillside near the "separating house,"
He was returning to his work from
luncheon just as the explosion oc
curred and was struck by a piece of
iron that was broken from a vat and
sent through the air with terrific force.
It struck a huge stanchion in its flight
after striking Schartau and then went
out of sight over, a hill.
The explosion occurred at 12:40
o'clock, as all th^ clocks in Giant were
stopped at that time by the concus
sion. Most of the employes of the
works were at dinner at that hour,
else the loss of life migjit have been
far greater. There are nine girls and
a large number of white; men and Chi
nese at the place and if many had been
upon the grounds at the time some un
doubtedly would have been killed by
the flying debris.
STORY OF DISASTER.
generally known around the plant that
the workmen in the "separating house"
had been having trouble with the acid.
It could not be made to "separate" as
it should have done. It seems that the
acid was a new kind that had recently
been purchased from the Peyton Chem
ical Works at Martinez. Until recent
ly the Giant Company manufactured
its own acid, but discontinued this
practice when the Peyton company
started operations. Â¦ >
Jackson, the young man who was
killed, told a number of friends only
as, long ago as Sunday night that he
had been having' trouble getting the
acid and the oil that came into the
"separating house" to separate. He
told this to his fiancee. Miss Isabelle
Craig, and a number of other young
women who work at the plant. He
said that one night he had worked
until 1 o'clock in the morning "to sep
arate i the two dangerous liquids before
he finally succeeded. Jackson declared
the new acid to be the cause of all the
trouble and expressed the fear that
he stood in some danger of losing his
life.
"We all, knew that there was danger
on account of the acid and oil not sepa
rating," she said. "Farrer told a lot of
us girls last Sunday night that he had
worked until 1 o'clock one night trying
to make it go. He said he had some
fears, and I told him to be careful."
: .) Frank Roller, superintendent at the
works, doesn't believe that the new
acid had Â¦ anything â¢ to do with -it. To
him.who is familiar with every branch
of the powder-making industry, there
is no explanation. ;
: "Those 'â¢ men were too careful to let
any fife i : get the best of them," said the"
superintendent. "They "were too expe
rienced- for, that, and I : think It must
have been; something very unusual that
occurred to* cause the accident."
Â¦ The" men killed ' had seen long service
Even when the Giant/ Company used
the oil it manufactured the mixture In
the separatingihouse frequently caught
fire. And for the purpose of quenching
it the separating-house is provided with
a hose, so that water may be turned on
at any: minute. There was frequent use
for this hose lately, according to the
statements of the 'officials and work
men about the place, on account of the
uncertain quality of the new acid, and
extreme caution was exercised in the
hrfndling'of it. :
Miss Craig, to whom Jackson was to
have been married. on April 20 and who
is the daughter of one of the Giant
workmen, said to-day that she had had
misgivings that an accident would oc

FIRES WERE FREQUENT.
seconds separated them from death.
McClellan was carrying a lunch to
Jackson and Pepin at the time of the
explosion and if he had been a little
earlier would have suffered the same
fate as the two men he was about to
regale. Flynn was returning. to work
from lunch and for some providential
reason escaped instant death, as he
was nearer the ill-fated men than
either Schartau or McClellan.
Nels Johnson, foreman in the nitro
glycerin department, ran away from
his station above the separating
house as soon as he heard the explo
sion, fearing that the burning wood
about the place might start the explo
sion in the other places and cause still
greater destruction. This did not oc
cur", fortunately, and Johnson crept
back out of the hole in the hillside in
"which he had secreted himself.
At the time of the accident Jackson
and Pepin were "separating" the last
of a lot of acid and oil that had come
down from the nitro- glycerin depart
ment. It seems that after the nltro
glycerln reaches the separating-house it
is separated and then run to the wash
ing-house, where it is "washed," and
then finally run to the nitro-glycerin
storage tanks 500 feet away from the
scene of the explosion. In course of
time it is taken from these storage
tanks and turned into dynamite.
Jackson and Pepin should have been
through with their work at 12 o'clock,
but it is evident that they were still at
work at 12:40 o'clock. They had been
having a repetition of their trouble
with the new acid and were staying to
see that it "was properly "separated."
In fact they could not have left the
separating-house as long as there was
any acid and oil there, as the stuff would
explode if left alone. It has a tendency
to catch ; fire upon* small provocation.
For instance, a piece of wood or even a
cobweb falling into the mixture will ig
nite it spontaneously and then com
municate the flames to the other parts,
ultimately causing ah explosion.

LI.VER3IORE, March 14.â While su
perintending the repairing of a ware
house of Anspacher Bros., damaged *by
the windstorm last Thursday night,
William E. Tbom, a foreman in the
employ of Anspacher Bros., was caught
by a falling -.vali and instantly killed
this morning. The unfortunate man
v.as badly crushed and he was so deep
ly buried beneath the debris that it
was some time before the rescuers were
r.ble to extricate the body from the
ruins.
When the men went to -work to re
pair the damage one of the walls was
tottering and it was necessary to prop
it un to ke?D it from falling. Thorn
was directing the work on what seemed
the most dangerous part of the wall,
when, without warning, another part
of the wall near which he was stand
ing came down with a crash, burying
the fcTcman beneath a mass of planks
and timbers. . Rescuers at once set to
work to release Thorn, but when they
reached the body life was extinct.
Thorn was 40 years of age and leaves
a wife and four young children. He
was a prominent member of the Liver
more Fire Department and was also
a member of the Woodmen of the
Wcrld and the Foresters of America.
The funeral will be held next Wednes
day under the auspices of the local
lodge o! Foresters.
The refusal is said to have been based
upon a desire of Councilman, Baccus
to ihake up a favorable sentiment for
his resolution to add $85,000 to the bond
issue for the Fire Department.
This resolution was laid over to-night
in committee of the whole. Objection
to it is raised by members of the bond
committee on the ground that the cost
of maintaining the additional equip
ment could not be met by the $1 tax
levy rate.
Councilmen Aitken, Fitzgerald, Saceus
and McAtlam formed a combination to
night that prevented the holding of a
special meeting by the City Council to
discuss the projected bond issue. A
call for the meeting had been sent out
"over the signatures of Councilmen Cu
vellier, Elliott, Howard, Dornin and
P"endleton:
Councilmen Wallace and Meese ap
peared this evening and with Elliott,
Cuvellier, Howard and Dornin num

A ladÂ»v asked if Gray Bros, had a
permit to trade Thirtieth street and
I'raunhart called attention to the fact
t hat a resolution directing the Board of
Works to see that the charter was not
l>einj? violated by that firm was still in
the hands of the Mavor, but that no
permit had ever been granted for the
purpose.
Rev. Father Connolly, pastor of St.
Paul's Church, said that all the people
!n the surrounding district are opposed

"We had hoped that our Mayor
v.ill stand by the common people and
we trust that he will see his way clear
to do so," said Father Connolly.
this ordinance Is passed over
the llayor'j^veto or not, I hope some
KXreemest may be arrived at to rid
us of this rock crusher, which Is a
prcat nuisance. If it takes us to the
end of our lives that rock crusher is
poing out of that place."
Erandensteln took occasion to ex
press confidence in the honesty of
Braunhart In view of the Mayor's at
tack upon the latter, saying tfiat hit
colleague had always had the best In
terests of the people at heart.
PASTOR MAKES PROTEST.
'"I do not propose to allow my char
acter to be besmirched," said Braun
hart. "My reputation will compare fa
vorably with that of the Mayor."
'Â¦These personalities must close,"
Â«tld Mayor Echmitz. "I will not be In-
Kulted by you or by any other member
of the board. If the cap has fitted you,
wear It."
Braunhart resented the Mayor's ref
erences, claiming that he had no ul
terior motive in talking to Gray Bros.
as he had done.
BRAUN1IART REPLIES.
Action was not taken before the bad
feeling existing between Mayor
Bcbznlts and some of the members of
the board had frequently cropped out
in rather heated manner during the de
bate. The Mayor and Supervisor
Braunhart engaged In a wordy battle
regarding the former's reference to
Fraur.bart's having asked Gray Bros,
vrhy they had not seen him before es
tablishing- their quarry on Thirtieth
street. The reference which precipi
tated hostilities was contained in the
following reply to the caustic report of
the Street Committee recommending
that The ordinances be finally passed,
notwithstanding the Mayor's vetoes of
the same:
Th* report of the Ftreet Committee on my
\ftu messages is bo full of studied personal in
pult and garbled mitTtpresentation that, ecn
irary to my usual custom. I will not permit It

year, hag rr&nif^sted itself on every possible
Hecuba rtiould cause the members of this
t"srd to far to forget themselves and their
fluty a* Jo permit a report of this kind to be
r.ade. Litericr motives are basely Insinuated.
?Â¦â¢T.tences 1n mr meFsajje are torn from their
context and misconstrued, while others are de
!;r*rste:y cmttted.
The veto messages which nave Just been read
give in full the reasons for ray action. They

Urother* cannot carry out their business wlth

robwqatat ordlntnce extending the limits.
BELIEVES IN" FAIR PLAY.
Kut I believe In fair play to every one. The
:n insistency, if any, is on the part of tomÂ«
of the Supervisors. A few months ago you
i amrd an ordinance providing that no rock
cnMhtas should be dime in this city within
Thirtieth street. By this you declared that
l-Â»yond Thirtieth street such business could be
tarried en. Helving upon this, these men pro
ceeded to tear down their Twenty-sixth-street
I Â¦lart. and. 1n conformity with the ordinance.
I'uxeoded 10 e^tab'.iFh themselves en the other
<-s<Je if Thirtieth street.
N.w you are pursing them again. This ap
}.^ared to me a great deal like malicious per
>Â¦ nut iiersr-rutlon. especially in view of Gray
llmtkd*' public assertion that a certain Super
r who lias this report aeked them
why ti,r\ had not seen him first and stated
viat bt-r-auEe they had not he was against
i.'iem. right cr wrong.
Notwithstanding nay disgust at ecch appa
i'iii persecution I would not have Interfered
:' srtusl damage were ehown. but I have per
fr-.nally investigated the matter and visited
ibe locality, and I believe the protestants are
more frightened than hurt. If at any subse
quent date I find any resulting damage, if Gray
Brother* cannot do what they have agreed in
Â¦writing to do. I will be the first to advise the
ci a restrictive ordinance.
MATTEIi OF JUSTICE.
As individuals Gray Brcthera are nothing to
*Â»â¢. From a political standpoint It would un
iÂ«'ubted!y be easier to comply with the request
of the protestants. but as & matter of Junice
rnd fair dealing, which must stand above
)*Mit)cs and above personal consideration. I be
ii've. within the law. !n giving every man a
c hance and in protecting every citizen against
mslJclous persecution.
IVJth regard to the personal antagonism of
members of this board against myself, I
went to fsy thie: In the interest cf the" public
fonict: I df-bired to .have friendly relations be
tween the members of this board and myself.
In iny inaugural message I expressed the hoj>e
that all personal feelings might be laid a&ide
and that w<; might work together as friends
For the city's good. Instead of this, every pos-
Fibl* opportunity has been seized upon by cer
tain members of your board unjustly to a*sault
ihe administration, and indeed, to Insult the
jiTMin of the chief magistrate of this city
r-ly'.ng upon his regard for the dignity of his
otf.ee to refrain from reply.
This cannot be allowed to go on much longer
and I now warn the members cf this board
who have thus been conspiring and attacking
for petty political motives to discontinue, or
they will taJcc the consequences. I welcome
any legitimate criticism, and will encourage
and appreciate any sincere opposition, but I do
not propose any longer to stand from any
member of this board any further open Insult
euch as U contained in this report.

While the Sunset express was speed
ing along last Saturday evening them
was trouble in the dining car, and the
story was told by four colored gentle
men to Judge Cabaniss and an Interest
ed assemblage of chair-warmers yes
terday morning. William H. Milo, who
figured as defendant In the case, tes
tified that he and three other members
of the culinary department were clean-
Ing utensils In the pantry of the car
when he accidentally dropped some
acid, with which he was shining a cop
per vessel, upon the trousers worn by
the complaining witness, E. McCor
mick, who thereupon waxed exceeding
wroth and emitted uncomplimentary
language. "Quit yoV f ussln* an'.gwan
wif yp* wu'k," was Mr. Milo's only re
tort to the tirade of abuse which, he
alleged, Mr. McCormick hurled at him,
but he warily kept an eye upon the
angered ge'ntleman's movements and
was prepared to protect himself in thtÂ»
event of words giving way to blows.
While thus engaged he saw Mr. Mc-
Cormick pick up a pair of large carv
ing knives and turn toward him,
whereupon he snatched up a sharp and
heavy cleaver and with it dealt M;\
McCormick's cranium a blow that
would have cleft from crown to chin a
Caucasian head, but which merely
made a small abrasion upon Mr. Mc-
Cormick's Ethiopian skull and blunted
the edge of the cleaver.
Mr. McCormick stated that he never
thought of carving Mr. Milo with the
knives, and was more surprised than
hurt by that person's sudden applica
tion of the cleaver. Then Mr. McCor
mick added: "When he drapped the
acid on my pants I jes* sez, 'Luk heah,
man, what yo # tryin' ter doâ ruin ma
cloase?' An' he says, 'Yo' am a Hah.'
Den I sez, sez I, 'Ef yo'am a gen'lem'n

Four little boys in Conlan's court and
an equal number In the tribunal of
Fritz were sent up to the Juvenile
Court for having been unable to satis
factorily explain why they were roam-
Ing the public streets after 8 o'clock
p. m. The police are under instruction
to make a specialty of arresting "kids"
that violate the curfew ordinance.
Judge Conlan dismissed nine men ac
cused of playing poker in a Tenth
street clubroom, and Judge Cabanias
made similar disposition of fifty-five
men who had been arrested for poker
playing in the Washoe Club, 103 O'Far
rell street. In the latter case Police
Captain Duke, who led the raid, In
formed the court that he had not
prompted the arrests and had insuffi
cient evidence to convict, as he could
r.ot Drove that the Washoe Club con
ducted a percentage game. As the or
dinance prohibits poker-playing only
in public places, and as the Washoe
Club apeared to be open to members
only, dismissal was ordered.
While dismissing the charge against
Henry Bradburn, accused of having
been drunk and disorderly in the Pal
ace Hotel. Judge Conlan remarked that
he had heard of other instances of al
coholic indiscretion in the big hostelry
during times of political activity. To
which Clerk Rice retorted that he un
derstood the Palace was a choice meet
ing place for Democrats. This the
Judge most strenuously denied, and the
denial was emphatically backed up by
Attorney Weller. who declared that
Republicans only foregather to do poli
tics in the Palace. Clerk Rice was
about to say something in defense of
his party when the court cut him olf
by abruptly calling the next case.
"Twenty-five dollars fine or twenty
five days in jail for you, William," was
the Judge's comment. "And*when you
get out of this trouble I hope you
will forever abstain from participat
ing in the milkmen's chorus, 'Yes, We
Shall Gather by the River.' "
Then came William Cain, a driver
for the Golden Eagle Dairy, on Brazil
avenue, to explain why he had bee,n
hawking milk which expert analysis
had demonstrated to be 20 per cent
aqua pura. William said that the milk
was pure as it came from the cow
when he started out to distribute it,
but rain had entered the can while his
back was turned and sneakingly effect
ed the dilution- .
"For what," quoth the Judge, "do
I know about diseases of liver? Mine
is not an expert eye. The liver in ques
tion might be reeking of all kinds of
ailments and I could not detect them.
No; keep the liver where it is and al
low me to find out its condition by
means of hearsay." â¢
that there was no case apinst him, as
he had not actually offered the liver
for sale. All of this Impelled the court
to reserve its decision until this morn
ing. /
Dr. Creely testified that while driving
along Market street his attention was
attracted by the debilitated condition of
the contents of Maloney's wagon, and
that closer investigation satisfied him
that the entire load was unfit for
human food. In corroboration of the
complainant's testimony, Dr. D. F.
Westphal stated that he had examined
the liver and found it diseased, but the
disease was so slight as to be visible
only to the expert eye. Dr. W. P.
Hassler indorsed Dr. Westphal's find
ing and believed that the optic of the
inexperienced layman might search In
vain for disease in the liver. He had
examined the remainder of the meat
in Malony's possession and found it
all sufficiently healthy to be eaten with
impunity.
To convince the court that he was
not a mere alarmist, but had ample
grounds for Ms complaint. Dr. Creely
offered to have the liver produced In
court, but the offer was hastily de
clined.
A considerable portion of Judge Mo
gan's session yesterday was consumed
in oral analysis of a beef liver which
James Maloney, employed by Samuel
Aftergut, was conveying to market
when he was arrested on complaint
of Veterinary Surgeon E. J. Creely,
who opined that the meat was dis
eased. There was a conflict of opinion
as to the extent to which the liver was
tainted, and the defendant pleaded
Seven soldiers asseverated that they
were not shooting craps, but simply
watching some civilians play the game,
when they were arrested Sunday at
the Presidio, gate. Judge Mogan evi
dently did not believe their plea, for
each of them was fined $5.
* * *
Herman Payne, master of the llme
juicer Mandalay, was found not guilty
of shooting at Watchman Charles Poy
er of the same trim craft. Captain
Payne explained that he carried a pis
tol because / he was afflicted with a
rebellious crew, and that he was. sim
ply transferring the weapon to Poyer,
when it was -accidentally discharged.
So he was discharged by Judge Ca
baniss.
John Kelley. a colored man, who
claims to be of Hibernian nativity, was
sentenced to thirty days' imprisonment
for vagrancy after he had begged
Judge Mogan to enable him to be at
liberty to celebrate the natal day of
Erin's patron. saint.
The gray-haired mother cf 16-year
old Thomas Kerwin tearfully acknowl
edged to Judge Mogan that the court's
previously expressed estimate of her
son's worth had proved correct, and
that she desired the Judge to punish
the incorrigible youngster as he consid
ered proper.
Twice had the boy been before the
same tribunal oh a charge of petty lar
ceny, and twice had the Judge respond
ed to the mother's pleading and re
leased him. So when he was arrested
on the mother's complaint of incorrigl
bility the Judge was not surprised.
"I told you twice before," he said to
the weeping woman, "that this boy
would never be anything more satis
factory than a criminal and ingrate.
He is instinctively bad, and it would
have been better for him and for you
If I had sent him to a reformatory
when he first came, before me. I will
do so now, and for your sake I hope
that his new environment, will extin
guish his vicious tendencies." Â¦
"All right. But In advocacy of my
friend here, Mr. Ryan, I desire to sayâ"
"Oh, go along to the 'tanks' and take
Mr. Ryan with you. Next case, Mr.
Clerk."
Sarsfleld O'Brien shuffled away with
the air of a martyr to judicial tyranny.
Sarsfleld O'Brien, who has been im
prisoned for vagrancy until the County
Jail complains of a void when he is
at large, stood before Judge Mogan
yesterday and eloquently pleaded for
the release of Lawrence Ryan, with
whom he was arrested on the old
charge.
"May It please the court," said Sars
fleld, "I ask for mercy for my fellow
defendant. His noble spirit 1s suffi
ciently humiliated by appearing here,
and your clemencyâ"
"How long have you been out of
jail?" was the irrelevant interruption.
"A long timeâ seven weeks."
"Must seem like a lifetime to you."
remarked the Judge. "Come up to
morrow and I'll send you back to the
old home."
William Enright visited a catchpenny
show in which the marvels of electrical
invention are exhibited, and so enthu
siastic did he become over what he saw
that the manager of the establishment
summoned Police Officer Eckman to
eject him. Three times did the officer
gently thrust William outside the door,
and three times did William return.
Then the officer exercised a little
roughness, whereupon William kicked
the officer's shins. Arrested, pronounced
guilty by Judge Mogan and remanded
till to-day for sentence.
But there was nothing incongruous
in Margaret O'Connell's appearance as
she was accused of vagrancy by Police
man Harry Hook. "Old offender" was
plainly stamped upon Margaret's bloat
ed countenance and betrayed by her
bedraggled attire. "Take her away and
I'll sentence her to-morrow,"' said Judge
Mogan, wearily, when the policeman's
recital was finished.
Mary Jones â which probably Is not
her name â was such an unlikely look
ing person to be accused of vagrancy
that Judge Mogan held her until the
police have discovered something more
about her identity. As she stood before
the bench there was refinement- in her
countenance, costume and manner, and
the Judge rubbed his eyes and glanced
at her again after Policeman Connolly
had sworn that he found her wander
ing about Chinatown in an intoxicated
condition. She was not sufficiently Ine
briated to be communicative, however,
and all she told was that her name Was
Mary, Jones and that she did not reside
in San Francisco.
Joseph Miller, cigar dealer at Geary
street and Grant avenue, was before
Judge Mogan on a charge of selling
pools on horse races, and informed .the
court that he had not employed an at
torney and would defend the case him
self.
"So let It be," remarked the Judge;
"but don't forget, Mr. Miller, that the
layman that acts as his own attorney
usually has a fool for a client."
Mr. Miller was given until this morn-
Ing to digest^ this chunk of judicial
philosophy. The arrest was made by
Police Officer Cogill, who Invested a
dollar to make his case good.
â¢ â¢ â¢

As the evidence did not make It clear
ttfat either of the gentlemen acted with
malicious Intent the case was dis
missed.
'â¢Does your Honor mean to say that
Mr. Milo did not Intend to Inflict griev
ous bodily harm when he struck Mr.
McCormick with the cleaver?" inquired
the prosecuting attorney.
"That's what," replied the Judge. "If
Mr. Milo had really intended to injure
Mr. McCormick he would have smitten
some part of his anatomy other than
his head."

UNTIL yesterday Judge Parker had not been heard
of for six weeks, as a Presidential candidate. The
last time he was mentioned was when Fitzger
ald, member of Congress Â«from 'New York, interrupted
Landis of Indiana with an impassioned ascription to Par
ker as the hero of the Democracy, the bearer of the ark
of the covenant of liberty, the hope of the people, the
loved of the masses, their very present help in time of
trouble, the household word around the winter firesides
of the republic.
When he stopped for breath,, Landis said: "Can 'the
gentleman from New York give me Judge Parker's post
office address?" Fitzgerald, still sweltering from his elo
quent exertion, repfied that he could not. "Then let me
know his given name," said the -cold and deliberate
Landis. Then the New York member had to confess
that he did not know the given name of this national
hero and household word, and the whole House roared
with laughter at the anti-climax, and no ventured
to* refer tojudge Parker again until the 13th inst.
Meantime the have been thumbing the New
York blue book wherein his name appears as an official,
and it is given out that "Judge Alton B. Parker's nomi
nation is practically assured." This is a statement in
the line of a directory, for it carries his. given name.'but
should also give his address, to the end that no one may
be caught like Congressman Fitzgerald.
The directorial information is said to come from "one
of Judge Parker's foremost managers," and therefore is
of importance. Now what sort or managers has the

Human Contradictions.
This story, which has been the cause for much fruit
less -controversy and bandying of words to and fro by
the opponents of Roosevelt, seems to be settled, once
for all, by the new light thrown upon it by Francis E.
Leupp, in his recently published'book, "The Man Roose
velt." The author of this personal view of Roosevelt,
who as a veteran Washington newspaper correspondent,
had ready access to the inside circle of affairs at the
time when Long's anecdote about the Assistant Secretary
is placed, discusses the incident as follows: â¢
"The whole record of this incident was long ago
transcribed from notes made by me in the spring of
1898, with the idea of some possible historical use to be
made of them later. With all-'tleierence to Mr. Long
and entire faith in his sincerity of purpose, I am bound
to believe that he overlooked one essential feature of the
story. He represents Mr. Roosevelt as anxious to crush
Cervera's fleet on the high seas instanter and without
notice, whereas my notes show that Mr. Roosevelt's
plan involved, as a preliminary, a warning to Spain that
she must take the responsibility for whatever happened."
If this closely intimate view of the^affair from the pen
of the man whose business made it imperative to get
at the truth can be taken as more authoritative than the
statement of ex-Secretary Long, there does not remain
much campaign material in the anecdote. The sending
of Cervera's fle'et across the ocean in the early days of
March, 1898, was as definitely a hostile act as the con
stant reinforcement of the Port Arthur fleet by the Rus
sians prior to February 8 was a blow in the face of
Japan. Let those who wish to take strong exception to
the suggestion of Secretary Roosevelt turn back to the
history of the Venezuela boundary dispute and there dis
cover what attitude Cleveland was to take the minute
an English fleet appeared off the Bahamas. His vigor
ous action at that time averted a possible clash between
the two nations.
OPPONENTS of the candidacy of Theodore
Roosevelt to succeed himself in the Presidency
are wont to lay great stress upon the contention
that he is "unsafe," that his "strenuousness" would prob
ably lead him to a grave indiscretion of policy and con
sequently plunge this country into needless complica
tions with some foreign power. To bolster up their as
sertions these timorous ones have been citing of late the
Roosevelt anecdote, now widely published, which occurs
in ex-Secretary of the Navy John D. Long's new book,
"The New American Navy."
The incident referred to in Long's book was one which
the author described as having taken place just prior to
the outbreak of the war with Spain, while Roosevelt was
Assistant Secretary of the Navy. "His (Roosevelt's) ac
tivity was characteristic," says Long. * "He was zealous
in the work of putting the navy in condition for the ap
prehended hard struggle. flis ardor sometimes went
faster than the President or the department approved.
Tust before the war he, as well as some naval officers,
was anxious to send a squadron across the ocean to sink
the ships and torpedo-boat destroyers of the Spanish
fleet while we were yet at peace with Spain."
NEW LIGHT ON AN OLD STORY.
There are three companies in New
York and Brooklyn that are about to
put on the market devices for printing
without types. One is capitalized at
110,000,000. The process is as simple as
a-b-c. To begin with, a typewriter with
the standard keyboard ia used to "set
up" the copy, not in lettters. but in per
forations in an endless strip of paper.
The completed tape looks somewhat
like the music used in automatons that
play the piano. The strip of paper ia
passed through a machine which prints,
with justification, sheet after sheet of
matter of the required size â a book
page or a newspaper. Impressions of
this printed stuff are then made upon
aluminum or zinc plates as thin as or
dinary sheet iron, which are placed
with equal facility upon both the bed
and platen and the cylinder presses.
Printing Without Type.
In the April Delineator Allan Suth
erland writes of a remarkable socio
logical experiment â no longer an ex
periment, for its practical value has
been demonstrated â that has been tried
in several large cities, of changing un
beautiful vacant lots into garden spots.
Vacant tracts of land are borrowed
from generous owners of real estate,
divided into small tracts and loaned to
needy people, chiefly old men, invalids
and children. They are furnished with
seed, tools, etc., and their work is di
rected by competent supervisors.
Among the many beneficent results of
the efforts of the Vacant Lots Associa
tion, the following are mentioned in the
article: Hundreds have found employ
ment who would otherwise have been
idle; land has been rescued from weed3
and rubbish and made to bring forth
fruits and flowers; little children who
at best could hope only for a "country
week" have found glorious "country
summer": they have had. in large
measure at least, suggestions of coun
try life, with its blessing of pure air,
wholesome food and health-giving ex
ercise, and many have already set their
faces resolutely to look for pleasant
homes In the country; indeed, the de
mand from suburban property owners
is rapidly increasing for these youth
ful trained workers of the solL
Vacant Lot Farms.
"Take this, mother," he said, hand
ing her the glittering coin, "and get
home out of the cold."
He was not very ragged, but his
clothes had an appearance of seediness
about them that was mute evidence
that prosperity and he had been
strangers for some time. As he stood
in the lee of the Phelan fountain he
presented a most disconsolate appear
ance. Suddenly he straightened himself
up and removing his hands from his
pocket gazed for several minutes at a
50-cent piece the opening of his fist dis
played. It was all he had. He shrugged
his shoulders, and with a contemptu
ous "humph" started toward one of the
gayly lighted, warm-looking saloons
that are plentiful in the neighborhood.
Within a few feet of the door he passed
a little woman, poorly clad, who was
standing close to the building, and in a
weak, quavering voice called out "even
ing papere."
The poor, weak voice attracted the
attention of the seedy man. and he
half-turned in the little woman's direc
tion. Then he walked toward the sa
loon. "With his hand on the swinging
doors he stopped, looked at the piece of
money in his hand and then with a
shiver turned and walked rapidly to
the vender of the news.
His Last Bit.
Winders will never cease in the administration of
public affairs in this city. Exhibiting an inexplicable,
activity, the police have actually raided a gambling den
that has flaunted its tempting vice for months on one of
our prominent thoroughfares. The incident suggests
itself as of sufficient importance to warrant an investiga
tion by the Police Commissioners. If the raid was war
ranted, why was it delayed?

We have very convenient rail communication with
Mexico, and American capital has been largely invested
to construct it. Its projection southward has : reached
within 172 miles of the Guatemala line. Thence souther
ly, disjointed projects are contemplated or under con
struction that will carry lines across the Central Ameri
can states. Salvador has long had a line in contemplation
from the vallej' of the San Miguel to Fonseca Bay, and
some construction has been done upon it. It may be. met
by a line from Guatemala easy of construction down the
valley of the Lempa, and intersected by lines from the
western seaports, Acajutla, La Libertad and El Triunfo.
To that county such a line would be the equivalent of
our railways down the Atlantic coast, by which New
York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, Savannah,
Mobile and New Orleans are connected. It would tra
verse the rich alluvial zone of Salvador, believed to be
ihe richest part of Central America in its agricultural
possibilities. < Â»
Passing into Honduras there is a line already in oper
ation,* built by American capital. Nicaragua and Costa
Rica are backward in construction, but their topography
offers no impassable obstruction to a road. Once across
Panama, by hugging the coast rather closely the moun
tains of Colombia may be .avoided, and when the line
enters Ecuador there is nothing in climate or other phy
sical conditions to hinder easy construction, to connect
existing links through Peru and Chile to the Andean tun
nel through which the road must pass to the east side of
the mountains, into Argentine territory.
Already roads from either side are aimed at that
crossing., respectively from Buenos Ayres and Valpa
raiso. Passengers regularly make the transit now, by a
portage over the summit at an* altitude of over 10,000
feet. But the trip with saddle and pack animals is very
trying and offers no facility to commerce. When the
tunnel is bored, as it will be, all rail goods trains can
carry trade between the two coasts of South America.
Heretofore the difficulties have been political rather
than topographical or financial. After crossing the Rio
Grande this inter-American field has to traverse . eleven
different nations. No other line in the world has to deal
with as many jurisdictions and separate sovereignties.
Many of them are nations frequently at war with each
other, or torn by internal dissensions and domestic revo
lutions. By the last steamer it was reported that Central
America is chafing under such a long period of peace.
Salvador has had no revolution since Regalado smote
Gutierrez out of the Presidency in 1898, and Honduras
has been quiet nearly a year. Colombia is biting her
thumbs over the loss of Panama and is probably to be
the prey of Venezuela.
All of them would be made peaceable and prosperous by
the construction of this railway, which would make their
products readily exchangeable, give them quick mails
and bring them into the world and out of their seclu
sion. It would touch the business ambition of their
people, promote production, raise the standard of life
and touch their politics with" a zeal for the public welfare.
It would be the greatest north and south' highway in the
world, eclipsing Cecil Rhodes' Cape to Cairo dream of
a longitudinal line through Africa. His project was to
cross 65 degrees of latitude. The American project from
the northern line of Mexico would traverse 70 degrees.
His line would be inland the whole distance. The inter-
American railway would let on the Pacific, \vith access to
the seaports of Mexico, Guatemala, Salvador, Honduras,
Panama. Ecuador, Peru, Chile and Argentina. As
Jinks aggregating only 4800 miles remain to be built to
complete the American line, at a cost of $150,000,000, it
will be completed long before the Cape to Cairo plan is
accomplished.
THE very full acount of the report of Commissioner
Pepper, on the inter-American railway, which The
Call has published, will be taken as a satisfactory
report of progress in that great project. Such a railway
to connect the Rio Grande with the Rio de la Plata, and
give an all rail route from all parts of the United States
and Canada to Buenos Ayres, must of necessity be built
down the west side of the Andean range. On the east
side the obstacles presented by the mountains are the
least of the difficulties to be overcome by engineering.
The vast swamps of the Orinoco, the Rio Negro, and be
yond them the tropical forests and marshes of the Ama
zon and its tributaries, are obstructions that can be con
quered only by exhausting the wealth of the world, and
then the tropical poison of the climate would defeat the
purpose of such an enterprise, which is the union of the
extremes of the hemisphere by rail, and the supplying of
rapid mail facilities and means of communication and
commerce, useful to the peoples of both continents.

A part of the value of gold consists
:i its scarcity! If it were as plenty as
iirl it would not only be as cheap
is dirt, but a great deal cheaper, for it
!i-<mld be the greatest nuisance in the
i- or!d, since the uses to which it can
be put are very limited. Its principal
lttraetions consist in its beautiful
.olor. in its freedom from rust or oxi
latjon, and its great capacity for be
ns welded without heat, drawn into i
Â¦-lender wire, and hammered out into J
'.lmoFl inconceivably thin sheets. It t
has not the strength of iron or the ca
pacity of taking and keeping an edge.
But from the earliest ages it has been
fo attractive to men and so free from
the "rust that doth corrrupt," and
ivithal so scarce, that it has been re
garded a?ii most "precious" metal and
has served ajs the most convenient
medium of exchange called "money."
Bat. for all that gold is so scarce,
t is very widely distributed. An In-
Lonceivable amount of gold is dis
solved in the water of the ocean, but
n such Email quantities that It would
ost a thousand times as much to ex-
Tact it as the quantity extracted
ivouid be worth when in our posses
sion. The principal source of the sup
ply until very recent times has been
he deposits of sand and gravel form
ing the deltas of mountain streams
Â»nd lining their banks near their
source. These gravel deposits and
sandbars through which the gold is
â¢ isseminated are called "placers."
Placer mining consists In separating
he gold from the worthless ma
priaL through which it is dis
t minated, and it is carried on by a
â¢;iriety of processes in which water
akc-s a prominent part. The gold, be
npr heavier than almost any other tna
:erial, sinks to the bottom when agi
:at<?d in water, where It is found con
centrated after the removal of the
ighter material.
One of the earliest sources from
which gold was obtained was in the
bed of the Rion River, which coming
down from the Caucasus Mountains
empties into the Black Sea near Ba
tum. This was the celebrated region
lo which the Greeks resorted in early
times in search of the golden fleece,
Â¦.vhich now supposed to be nothing
else than a fleece of wool which had
'>etn F^rcad over the bottom of the
i'ion River, where the current swept
ilong a small amount of sand and
(Travel iti which particles of gold were
intermingled. The gold, being heavier
:han the gravel, kept closest to the bot
tom, to that the particles became en
iangled in the meshes of the fleece and
i bus it became "golden" in more than
a figurative sense. This mode of min
inp: < known as the GInsley process) is
still practiced and is the most efficient
way of getting fihe particles of gold
disseminated through a great body of
sand. A stream of the gold-bearing
rand is kept moving over a long stretch
of felt cloth by a current of water,
which carries away the sand, but per
mits the gold to be caught in the meshes
of the cloth, which after being shaken
for successive times to set free the
particles cf gold is finally burned, so
as to extract the entire amount that
has been entangled.
But in the more common placer mines
the gold Is found in bean-shaped
nodules of all e'.z**;â from thoÂ«e scarce
ly perceptibie to the naked eye up to
those -which weigh twenty or thirty
pounds, and in some rases even one
hundred pounds, one such mass having
been found in the Ural Mountains in
1642 and being now preserved in the
museum at St. Petersburg. In the rich
placers an immense amount of grold has
been extracted by the familiar hand
l>rocÂ«5s known as "panning." from
which there comes our expressive
phrase "pan out." The gravel Is shov
eled into a pan with flaring edges,
r.hich is heSd under a stream of water
and skillfully keut in motion by hand
and shaken so that the lighter material
is carried over the edge of the pan and
the heavier minerals left at the bottom..
But i;Â» gravel banks consisting of
rr.-arscr material, with a smaller pro-
PC'itlonai amount " of gold inclosed,
â¢ttbfcr more effective devices are resort
ed to for securing the separation. Often
a j<rt of water under great hydraulic
pressure is Â«!irected through the nozzle
of a "hose air.ainst a gravel bank, disin
fgratir.R it and washing it dor.nto
iÂ«>w*r-l*vels; in ublch process. Uic ma
terial is swopt throush a flume with
Â» -rough bottom, into tire crevice? of
which the sold settles while the gravel
and pebbles are r,wept beyond. After
n. suIHcicnt length of time the flume <Â«
e'eared out and tlie gold collected froru
the bottom.
Qit#-tjt!me* the rivers^ themselves
prow to be the best hydraulic agencies
for Â¦ separating the cold. As thes-f
mountain ftrenms wear atray the
gravel- torraces upon their banks they
<-arry the lijrtiter material to lower
levels, while the go!d . is caught in
peckets and holes that cover the bottom
of the stream. '
But the gold found in placer rhinos

The profit to be derived from quartz â¢
mining depends upon a combination of |
conditions, a vein of quartz rich in
gold may be so thin that it will not
pay to work it at great depths. A
rich vein of greater thickness may be !
in euch an inaccessible position that
the cost of working it would be exces
sive. One of the most celebrated ex
amples of a low grade gold bearing
quartz which has been' worked to great '
profit because of its accessibility is the i
Douglas mine, near Juneau, in Sc/uth- j
eastern Alaska. Here, rising from the |
water's edge, is a great mass nf quartz
with a small amount of gold dissemi
nated through it, averaging only about
$2 or $3 a ton. But the quantity is al
most unlimited; the stamping mill is
built close by the wharf; the quartz
is mined from the mountainside im
mediately in the rear and brought down ]
to the uppw stcTy of the mill by grav- j
ity, where stamping machines, moved
by water power, are set to work
upon it.
The final separation of the gold, espe
cially of that which is in fine particles
distributed through the quartz or grav- j
el, has until recently been secured prin
cipally by the use of mercury, which
has strong affinity for it, and when j
mixed with the residuum containing i
gold forms an amalgam, which can be
removed and easily subjected to sep
arate treatment to again free the gold.
But the most remarkable recent ad
vancement in the art of separating gold j
has been by the use of potassium cya- j
nide, which has the advantage of be
ing very cheap and of being able to
be used over and over; while the quartz
for this treatment does not need to be j
bo finely comminuted as for mercury, i
Potassium cyanide dissolves gold, when
the liquid readily yields it up again 1
on being supplied with certain other
compounds for which it has a greater
affinity. Through the use of this meth
od, which was discovered only a few I
years ago, the production of gold is
likely to be increased almost Indefi
nitely, gince ores of much less rich
ness, and indeed immense piles of ref
use discarded by the old process, can
be made to yield a profitable supply of
gold.
The variations in the supply of the
world's stock of gold have been re
markable. At the time of Christ it is
estimated that the total amount of
gold and silver in possession of the
world was worth about $2, 000, 000, 000,
of which we may suppose that one
half was gold, but this stock gradually
diminished, through abrasion, acci
dental loss and use in the ornamental
arts, till in the ninth century it was
reduced to about one-eleventh of that
amount, or to about $200,000,000
worth. To this amount there was lit
tle increase until after the discovery
of America, when the mines of Mex
ico, Chile and Peru began to pour in
their supply to the European market.
Between 14 93 and 1S50 the addition
to the supply of gold from America
was $3,273,600,000, while from 1850
to 1879 the addition was $3,755,
600,000. This great increase in the
supply of gold since 1850 was due
largely to the gold discoveries in Cali
fornia, which were made in 1848.
About the same time there were also
remarkable discoveries of gold in Aus
tralia. From these two sourfces alone
there were in twenty years $2,500,
000,000 worth of gold added to the
stock already in existence; thus nearly
doubling the amount in the posses
sion of the world.
Nor has the production of gold in
the United States diminished in
amount, but rather increased. The
largest production of gold during the
height of early mining Interests in
California amounted to $65,000,000 in
1853. From this the production gradu
ally fell to about $33,000,000 annuil
ly In 1892. Since that time it has in
creased until in 1900 the production
of gold in the United Stages, according
to the last report of its Geological Sur
vey (1901) van $79,171,000, and in
1901 $78,666,700.
At present the United States leads
the world in the production of gold,
while Australia continues to produce
n bout- half the- amount furnished by
the United States. Another growing
center of gold production with un
known future capacities is Siberia,
j where placer mines of immense extent
are found. on the flanks of the Altai
Mountains, In the mountains west ,of
the .Yenisei River about Minusinsk,
near the Chinese border, and east of
Yeniseisk, half way down toward the
Arctic regions. Placer mines of still
greater extent are now worked with
i Immense profit in the almost Inacce3
i siblc headwaters of the Lena River,
J northeast of Lake Baikal, sind fn vari-
I ous mountainous districts bordering
the Amur.
But the most remarkable of all the
recent discoveries of gold are in the
Transvaal, South Africa. Jlere gold
was discovered in small quantities in
1867, or rather it should be said re
discovered, for the whole country is
covered with the remains of prehis
toric mines, which, with considerable
probability, are Identified by Mr. Ham
mond with the mines of Ophir to
which Solomon sent expeditions.' In
18S5 th.e most , sensational gold dis
coveries ever made were those at Wit
â¢watersrand, in the Transvaal, where ah
I area no larger than the District of
I Columbia was, at the breaking out of
j the Boer -war, furnishing gold at the
â¢ rate of $40;000,000' worth a year. The
j total amount of gold in this single de
j posit is *-Â«Â«tiTriatcd by Mr. Becker to be
j $3 f 50C',eCO,t>00.
I tsinins the jrold is dug out from the
vein and artistically pulverized under
the action of great stamping machines,
when streams of water are caused to
run over it and separate the gold from
the worthless rrmteriftl very much as
it has beÂ«?ii done in nature by the
mountain streams. * Â¦
Through the use of modern 'machin
ery of various sorts it !s now possible
tc follow . these pold-bearing quartz
veins to great depths below the earth's
I surface, thus putting within the reach
of man a supply of gold that was here
tofore unthought of. The celebrated
Comstock vein in Nevada has be^n
mined for a depth of 3100 feet, whtle
a tunnel 50.000 feet long has been dug
to drain the mine. The extreme heat
developed at such depths presents the
greatest difficulty in working th? mine,
\ but It has already yielded more than
I $150,000,000 worth of cold.

party has shown itself to be capable of almost anything,
but I do not think that it will commit the- folly of
throwing this chance away."
Farewell, Judge Parker. Your postoffice address
need not be given if that is the kind of foremost man
agers you have. It is a party capable of almost anything
that the country fears, and not Judge Parker, given name
and* address uncertain. His nomination will not certify
that the party ceases to be capable of almost anything.
The country saw it run away from the strongest man it
ever put' in the White House, and in spite of him try to
bankrupt the treasury, debase'thc currency, destroy the
nation's financial honor and credit, and in the effort
bring on a panic that is remembered with horror by all
who experitneed its rigors. The party "capable of al
most anything" did this against the command and coun
sel of Cleveland, Carlisle, Bayard, Gray, Lindsay, Pal
mer, Vilas and every general of division and corps com
mander in the part}', and even* of the captains of tens
and of hundreds and the file closers and truncheon men.
With that history does a*ny one pretend that the colorless
and impalpable personality of Judge Parker will hold it
in check?
His foremost manager has shown that he shares the
country's estimate and apprehension of the party, which
no nominee can change or reassure.
A number of humane citizens of the
capital citv of Mexico are experiencing
difficulties in forming a society for the
prevention of cruelty to animals. Amer
ican residents had for a long time been
talking of forming an organization for
the relief of the sufferings of their
dumb friends, and had at last succeed
ed in interesting several prominent
Mexicans In the project. A meeting
was called and the scheme was thor
oughly discussed. The consensus of
opinion was that a humane society
should be formed. It was thought that
recognition of the work by the authori
ties would be an excellent advertise
ment of the new organization and that
it would also awaken the interest of the
masses. A committee was appointed to
wait on" the Mayor of the City of Mex
ico. The Mayor welcomed his visitors
with open arms and listened attentively
to their outline of the proposed work.
At last he stated that he fully ap
proved of the scheme and thought that
it would prove of immense benefit to
the municipality. He was then In
formed that there was a lack of suffi
cient funds to give the work a proper
start. He knitted his brows for a mo
ment and then exclaimed, "I have it,
gentlemen; we will have a grand bull
fightâthe best that the city has seen in
years. The proceeds will be used for
the benefit of the new society."
The humane citizens have decided to
gather the necessary funds by soliciting
contributions.

Regarding the projected transformation
of the local system; in Oakland Into an

that no definite , plans have yet been
decided on, but the matter Is receiving
the attention of the company.
General Manager Kruttschnitt has
Just returned from a visit to New York,
and came west by way of the Lucin
cut-off, over -which the company has
begun to operate freight trains. Upon
being asked yesterday when the com
pany expected .to operate passenger
trains regularly over the cut-off he
said: \
"No definite time has been settled on.
The fact is that the construction de
partment is still engaged in operating
work trains over the new line. A great
deal of filling in has yet to be done
along the immense length of trestle, as
was done along the trestle to the Oak
land mole, and to clear the tracks sev
eral times each day for the passage of
passenger trains would consume much
time of the construction department.
Therefore we have decided not to at
tempt to operate our passenger service
over the cut-off until all work has been
completed, which may be some time."
E- O. McCormiek left here for New

only consented to accept it about ten
days ago. He is regarded as one of
the most popular men in the trans
continental railroad service. He rap
idly made friends in this city and his
leave taking will be deeply regretted
by those that enjoyed his association,
both in a business and social way.
Charles S. Fee, nho succeeds Mr. Mc-
Cormiek as passenger traffic manager
of the Southern Pacific Company, is

that he was chief clerk to the man
ager of the" Hannibal and St. Joseph
Road and secretary to the general su
perintendent of the Michigan Central.
He was appointed to the position of
passenger and ticket agent of the
Northern Pacific Railway in 18S3. It
was stated yesterday that Mr. Stubbs
will probably come west from New Or

"Mr. Stubbs has long felt the need
of another assistant in his offlce in
Chicago and his expressed wishes re
garding the selection of Mr. McCor
mick have been gratified. Mr. Stubbs
and Mr. McCormJck are now In New
Orleans, where they are attending to
several railroad matters. The change
here will take effect on April 1, by
which time it is expected that Mr. Fee
will be here."
Mr. McCormick's successor here Is to
be Charles S. Fee of St. Paul, who is
at present general passenger and
ticket agent of the Northern Pacific
Railway. The news of E. O. McCor

honest business man.
William Badger was a member of the

WASHINGTON, March 14.â The spe
cial committee appointed to investigate
charges against Senator Dietrich of
Nebraska resumed its hearings this aft
ernoon. William Dutton of Hastings
was called and asked by Senator Hoar
whether he had ever had a conversa
tion with a U. S. Rohrer of Hastings
regarding the appointment of Mr. Hahn
as deputy Postmaster under Fisher and
whether he had said that it would take
$500 to bring about h;s appointment.
Dutton emphatically stated that he had
never talked to Rohrer about the mat
ter, and did not know that Hahn was
a candidate.
Senator Dietrich took the stand. and
at his request was sworn, although
Chairman Hoar stated that the prac
tice at t the Senate had been not to
swear a Senator, on the, theory that
all Senators had equal rights in that
body. In reply to Senator Hoar he
first reviewed his elections as Governor
end as Senator, and in answer to Sena
tor Hoar said: "I have never received
a cent for the appointment of Jacob
Fisher as Postmaster." Then the Sena
tor told of his relation with Jacob Fish
er and how he came to recommend him
for Postmaster.
Senator Dietrich said that while he
was Governor he had made a contract
with the Postoffice Department for the
rent of the Dietrich building, at $1700.
This contract was made with Post
master General Smith. He heard of
protests regarding the rent to be paid
and told Jacob Fisher that he would
take $1300 for the building, although
he felt that he ought not to pay for
the fixtures. Fisher responded that he
would pay for them. Dietrich declared
that Jacob Fisher would have been
Postmaster no matter where the post
office might have/been located. He de
nied that the deed of the postoffice
property was made to his daughter so
that he could lease -his building to the
Government.
In reply to a question from Senator
Hoar, Senator Dietrich said that never
directly or indirectly had the question
of money been suggested to any can
didate or applicant for any position
while he was Governor or Senator, and
said he had never received directly or
indirectly a cent for any appointment
he had made; nor, had he ever expected
a cent from any one so appointed. He
said that when the money that had
been received by his daughter from Ja
cob Fisher for the rent of the back
room was returned to Fisher and Fran
cis he (Dietrich) paid the amount
his daughter's account at the bank be
ing overdrawn. Dietrich also denied
having had a conversation with Fisher
in which the subject of paying $14,000
for. Thompson's expenses came up.
The committee adjourned to meet
Wednesday. ,
Avers He Is Guiltless of
Any Attempt to Get Rich
at Expense of Government
WASHINGTON, March 14.âSecre
tary Taft was beard to-day by the
House Committee on Insular Affairs on
the pending bill "to provide for the
more efficient administration of civil
government in the Philippines."
Previous to the hearing Chairman
Cooper read to the committee a cable
gram sent by Secretary Taft, March 2,
abrogating the Bates treaty between
the United States and the Sultan of
Sulu and his dattos. The cablegram
says:
"ill view of the failure on the part of
the Sultan and the signing dattos to
discharge the duties and fulfill the con
ditions imposed upon them by said
agreement they forfeited all right to
the annuities therein stipulated to ,be
paid them and to all other considera?
tions due them under the agreement;
the treat}' is abrogated and held for
naught, and as residents of the Moro
province, in the Philippines Archipel
ago, they are subject to the laws en
acted therein under the sovereignty of
the United States."
The Secretary said this action was
taken because disturbances in the Jolo
group indicated that the Moros had
violated the terms . of the treaty.
Prompt action was taken in preference
to referring the matter to Congress,
because of the continuation of the dis
turbances. President Roosevelt was
consulted and approved the action.
Secretary Taft told the committee
that he had received a cablegram to
day from General Wade stating that
General Wood reported that on account
of the anti-slavery proclamation the
Morofi of the Rio Grande del Mindanao
district had risen, and that this armed
force had been met and defeated with
no American loss, but with consider
able loss to the Moros. A considerable
number of small cannon was captured
from the Moros in the engagement.
Representative Crumpacker Imme
diately drafted a substitute for the
Patterson bill abrogating the treaty,
providing that the action of the Presi
dent and Secretary of War taken on
March 2, 1904, unqualifiedly abrogating
the Bates treaty, be confirmed and ap
proved. Secretary Taft approved this,
but the committee decided to defer its
action on the matter, desiring to hear
Sacretary Taft on the railroad prob
lem in the islands.

SALINAS. March 14.â A dastardly at
tempt to kill six Japanese was reported
from Del Monte last night to Sheriff
Xesbitt.* Cn March 7 the Southern Pa
cific Company discharged its section
crew oX six Italians, working between
â¢Jastrovillt- and Pacific Grove, and sub-
Fiituted Japanese laborers. Five of thf
Italians took their time, -received their
money and left for the south, but the
other still loitered near Del Monte.
Saturday night about 11 o'clock a
loud explosion startled the residents of
Del Monte and Monterey. An investi
gation showed that the bunk house oc
cupied by the Japanese had been total
ly demolished by giant povrder or dy
namite. The occupants were thrown a
great distance and four of the numbc
were badly bruised. Detective P. Lewm
of the Southern Pacific and Sheriff
Nesbitt went to the scene and waited
till this morning. They discovered
tracks leading to and from a cabin oc
cupied by one Farino. It was learnei
that Farino had tK-en seen in posses
sion of several sticks of giant powder,
lie had also been heard frequently tc
utter threats to kill the Japanese out
of revenge for having been displaced
by them. A short search resulted ia
the arrest cf Farino, who at first de
rued that he knew what giant powder
was or that he had been near the cabin..
Upon pressure he admitted that the
tracks found were his, and that he had
been near the house about the time of
the explosion.
Farino is a swarthy Italian and has
been working for the railroad as a
section hand about fifteen years. Ha

ESCAPES CHARGE OF
VIOLATING THE LAW
Trustee McDonald of Bakersfield, Ac
cused, of Fraud, is Upheld by
Court Ruling.
BAKERSFIELD, March 14. â Judge
Bennett to-day sustained the demurrer
to the accusation recently filed against
City Trustee B. McDonald by the late
Grand Jury. The accusation charged
that McDonald bad violated the law by
selling goods to the city while a mem
ber of the Board of Trustees. The de
murrer was sustained on every point,
the court holding that no specific
charge was made In regard to the
goods sold, and that no willful vio
lation of the law was shown and that
euch must be charged before action
looking to removal from office can be
sustained.
It is-understood that no appeal will
bÂ« taken. and the matter is probably
ended. The goods alleged to have been
furnished the city were articles of sta
tionery purchased by the city from
McDonald's store in the same way as
they would have been by. any' other
customer.

The Sfin Francisco Athletic Club will
open the new Woodward's Pavilion
ripxt Friday night with an amateur
exhibition, consisting: of ten four-round
goes between well-known youngsters.
Th<? main event of the. evening will be
a mill between Owen Sullivan and
Walter Moreno. ',' crack heavy
weights.
After Jimmy finished his morning
run yesterday he rested till the noon
hour and then, after a hearty meal and
another rest, spent some time in the
gymn&sltnn, hitting the bag and pull
ing the various appliances about. When
he became tired of this diversion he
took to the road again and. after a
good brisk trot and a rubdown, put on
the mitt* with Frank Rafael.
A few lively rounds followed, in
which Jimmie landed some stiff ones
on the Jaw and body of his training
partner. He showed good speed and
got around lively on his feet. He used
both hands to advantage and blocked
the hard ones nicely. Britt stated last
evening that he weighed just â¢- 134
pounds.
Corbett doep not like the wet weather
in the least, and yesterday was rather
a gloomy one at the beach. Neverthe
less, the champion went out for his run
and came back perspiring freely and
fueling fine and frisky..
He devoted most of the afternoon to
roughing It around the gymnasium
with Billy Otts. He had the gloves on
with ihe latter and they mixed it in a
liv-ly manner. Corbett says that he is
but h few pounds overweight now and
will be down handily on the night of
the battle.
The remaining few days left to
Jimmy Britt and Young Corbett are
busy ones at the training quarters of
the rival lightweights. Though the
weather for some time past has hardly
come up to the standard required by
athletes, still the little fellows have
been making the best of it and doing
all the work they could.
Britt started in yesterday morning to
take two runs a day, instead of one.
Ke imagines that this will be good for
his wind and will harden his leg mus
cles and therefore he will continue oil
ihe double road stunt till a day or so
before the battle.
CHICAGO, March 14.â Benny Tanger
of this city and Aurelio Herrera
fought a six-round draw before the
American Athletic Club to-night. The
fight was fast for the six rounds. Both
men scored knockdowns In the third
round, when Herrera put Tanger to
the flgor with a hard left on the ear,
and Yanger, who rose instantly, sent
Herrera down with a left hook to the
Jaw. Herrera depended on a left hook
for the greater part of his fighting,
while Tanger used straight lefts to' the
head and a right to the body for his
work.
TRINIDAD. Colo.. March 14. â Chris
Evans was beaten by three masked
men with six shooters to-day on board
the Colorado and Southern passenger
train bound for Pueblo, and was taken

Arthur McKnight, the well-known
assistant starter, at present with Dick
Dwyer, has accepted the position of
starter for the new Union Jockev Club
of St. Louis. Arthur has had a world
of experience and there is no doubt In
the world but that he will make good
in a gallop.
P. Phillips' now riding at T^os An
geles, will be seen in the saddle here
later on in the week.
The stables of A. C. Hayes and W.
D. Twyma'n arrived from Los Angeles
Sunday night. Barney Schreiber
shipped- Lacy Crawford back here in
the same car to start in the Thornton
stake. â¢'.".'.
Joe Teager left Los Angeles for Hot
Springs Sunday night, taking along
his lightweight rider Hildebrand. .
Steve Rafour is camping right on the
trail of Charley McCafferty. Â¦ The. lat
ter took Idogo away from Rafour last
week and in retaliation Steve bid Dr.
Leggo up from $500 to $900 without get
ting the horse. Later on he tiltedChick
adee from $400 to $800 and McCafferty
let the mare go.
Dick Dwyer replaced Jake Holtman
at the barrier yesterday, after a very
successful spell of starting at Los An
geles. Dick's efforts with the barrier
were characterized bv the same clean
cut work that has made him -so pop
ular with horsemen, Jockeys and the
public throughout the country.
The disposal sale of Burns & Water
house was a success from every stand
point. The horses were sold during the
noon hour in the paddock at Oakland
yesterday,. Billy Magrane filling the
auctioneer's position. The nineteen head
knocked down realized $19,200. -W. B.
Jennings paid $4500 for Rocka way and
Ed Gaylord, the well-known Denver
turfman, bought Toledo for $2100, and
each was considered a bargain. Fol
lowing is a list of the horses sold and
the purchasers:
Martin rode two winners.
On the strength of his previous good
showing in a race last week Galanthus
looked almost a certainty and was
heavily played to take the fifth num
ber. He had Jack Martin on his back
and after Pickaway had shot his bolt
the first choice took command, beating
out the 25 to 1 shot, Mr. Farnum, with
plenty to spare. Alice Carey, Prue
wood and Blackthorn cut no figure in
the race.
NOTES OP THE TRACK.
Lamasney Bros, furnished the favor
ite for the mile and fifty yard run in
Silurian, played from threes to 13 to 5.
Roach, who rode him, managed to get
away from the post poorly, and was
beaten comparatively handily at the
end by Chickadee, a 6 to 1 shot, well
ridden by C. Smith. The latter mare
cut out the pace from start to finish.
Illowaho runs in bar plates and this
militates against his chances in the
sloppy going.
Henry Spencer, "the Iceman," gave
an exhibition of his old time skill in
the saddle on Celebrant in the last race
on the card at Oakland yesterday, and
was then unfortunate enough to lose
the decision to Sailor Knot, the mount
of Johnny Daly, by a nose. There were
but two other starters, Solanus and
Hugh McGovern. The former opened at
7 to 5, receding toward the close to
twos. Jack Martin piloted the Jen- i
nings entry and his riding was sol
amateurish as to be almost ludicrous.!
The two riders first mentioned had the
race between them from the start, Mar
tin dropping in behind them with So
lanus. From the three-sixteenths pole
to the wire Spencer and Daly had it
hammer and tongs, Sailor Knot on the
outside receiving the verdict. Thd win
ner was held at 11 to 5 almost through
out the betting. It was one of the
prettiest exhibitions of horsemanship
seen at the meeting.
The track was once more transform
ed into a sea of mud. The only win*
ning favorites were Salto and Galan
thus. An unusually good-sized crowd
was in attendance.
Without any ifs or ands about it
Hlrtle, the 16 to 5 favorite, should have
won the first race. Buxton took the
mare wide in the stretch when he had
a commanding lead, and through some
hcok or crook managed to lose ground
enough to finish fourth. Captivate,
touted around as the goods and backed
from 5 to 18 to 5, was landed first by
Jack Martin, a neck in front of Cassie
W. Pure Dale with Travers up waa
third. N
Such a pronounced plunge was made
on Bob Ragon at scant odds to win the
two-year old dash, that it looked as iÂ£
Gil Summers* colt might have received
the nomination by acclamation. Such
proved not to be the case though, for,
blessed with the best of racing luck,
Bob ran unplaced. J. T. Sheenan'. on
Bill Short reached the straight for
home first and looked like oil from the
can. But the youngster's inclination
to run out cost him the long end of the
purse, Bonner getting up on the 15 to
1 shot, Dr. Leggo, in season to put the
McCafferty colt over Just by a neck.
Light of Day ran third.
Dell Fountain's Salto spreadeagled
his field in the Futurity course run fol
lowing. A 6 to 5 favorite with Vander
bout in the saddle, the gelding won
easing up from Resigned. Away badly.
Dusty Miller downed Standard for the
show.

look overcolored and artists dislike
working there."

Pinkham's Vegetable Compound
has added so much to my life and

severe pain, and could find no relief, but
one day when visiting a friend I ran
across Lydia E. Plnkham's Vege-
table Compound, â she had used
it with the best results and advised
me , to try it. I found that it worked
wonders with me ; I now experience
no pain, and only, had to use- a few
bottles, to bring about this wonderful
change. I use it occasionally now
when I am exceptionally tired or worn

fioes Ashore Along Hawser.
A JÂ«panese passenger, detained on the
st*am*hlp City of Puebla by the Immigration
Bureau, made his way ashore on Sunday night
by shinning down one of the forward mopring
lines. He would have escaped had he not
waited on the bulkhead to replace the shoes
he had removed to facilitate his gymnastic
performance. The dock, watchman's suspicions
were aroused by the man's actions and, before
his second foot was shod the Japanese was In
custody. With one shoe off and one shop on,
thp wanderer from the island empire, was taken
back aboard the steamer and locked up. ' Prior
to making his hazardous descent of the hawser,
the -Japanese had offered the watchman on
bop.rd $20 to let him go.

The Overdue List.
The rate of reinsurance on the Dutch bark
Zwljger, now out 148 days from Havre for

cock and Clematis, 15 per cent.
Buteshire Is Still Ashore.
The British ship Buteshire, which was
driven ashore in l!lchardson Bay during last
Thursday's gale, is still hard and fast In the
mud and. so 'far. all efforts to get her Into
deep water have failed. 'Ihe Buteshire is
drawing only nine feet, but in her vicinity
there Is only seven feet or water at high tide.
The shea; water prevents the uss of the larger
of the tugboat fleet, and such towboats as can
get sufficiently near the stranded vessel lack
the nower necessary to drag the big Britisher
from her mud bed. Captain Pardee is thinking
seriouBly of employing house movers to get his
vessel within reach of tugboats strong enough
to pull her into desp watar. Her position,
meanwhile, would be very dangerous in the,
event of heavy weather.

Further details supplied yesterday by
the officers of the steamship City of
Puebla have added greatly to the
anxiety felt for the safety of the ship
William H. Macy, sighted by the
steamer on Friday afternoon in lati
tude 44.19 north, longitude 124.50 west.
Captain Jepsen kept the City of Puebla
within an eighth of. a mile of the Macy
for a considerable time and was pre
pared either to take the ship in tow
or to take the sailing vessel's company
on board his steamer.
Although no assistance was asked,
there is little doubt that the plight, of
the Macy was extremely serious. Most
of her sails had been blown away and
the remains, fluttering in ragged rib
bons, paid tribute to the overpowering
force of the wind. The Macy's run
ning gear was trailing over the side in
tangled disorder. The vessel's cargo
had evidently shifted, for she was
listed to starboard, lying almost on
her beam ends. That she was leaking
is also certain, for both windmill and
donkey engine were in full commission
pumping water from the hold". Those
on the Puebla's bridge saw only two
people on the Mary's deck. One was
the man at the wheel. The other was
hanging on aft and was apparently an
officer. Of the sailing^ vessel's boats
there were only two visible, one on
each side, forward.
The llacy's yards were trimmed on
the starboard tack except the fore and
fore lower topsail yards, on which sail
was still standing and which were
trimmed to port. *
The Macv left Oyster Harbor thir
teen days ago for this port. Captain
Grothe. her commander, is an able
navigator, well known here and . at
every port of any size on the Pacific.
The vessel is owned here by Eschen
& Minor and was built in 1883 at Rock
port, Me.
The weather prevailing at the time
the Puebla was in the Macy's com
pany is described by Captain Jepsen as
the worst he has ever experienced on
this coast.
Wycficld Has Hard Trip.
The British steamer Wyefleld; due here
Saturday evening, did not reach port until
yesterday rimming, having been., delayed - by
the southeaster. thtouRh the full force of which
she had to drive her blunt bow. Captain Wat
son, the collier's oommandfr, says that the
storm was th" worst Ho over experienced in
any water*. The velocity of the wind he cal
culate* at moro than eighty miles an hour, and
during the worst of the storm the btp, .heavily
laden tramt> was burled under tons of tur
bulrnt sieen sea. The Wyefleld was five days
and twenty hours ooming from Isarcaimo and
brought 4t.00 tons of ooal.

Xorth Ontario Member of Parliament
Pronounces Grand Trunk lane a
Great Addition to Empire.
OTTAWA, Ontario, March 14. â
George D. Grant of North Ontario, in
moving the address in reply to the
speech from the throne- in the House
to-day said that the building of a new
transcontinental railway was one of
the best assets that Canada could
make for the empire. Borden, leader
of the opposition, pointed out that all
reference to the joint High Commis
sion was omitted from the speech.
Sir Wilfrid Laurier in reply said that
Canada had decided not to again call
the joint High Commission. Canada
would make no more advances of any
kind to the United States. "Whatever
was done in that direction would have
to originate with the United States. If
the United States had anything to pro
pose Canada would listen to It. As to
the United States tariff, it fostered
combines and trusts and Canada could
not follow the example.

BEL,LJ2J?(3HAM, Wash., March 14.â
Superintendent J. J. Donovan of the
B. B. and, \B.C. Railway, returned home
to-day from San Francisco, where he
attended the ten-day session of the di
rectors o^iis road. Regarding the re
port that the Great Northern has pur
chased the B. B. and B. C. he denied
that such was the case. He refused to
answer the query as to whether it is
true that ; the Great Xorthern three
months ago had an option for its pur
chase and that a hurried trip which
he then made to New Tork was for the
purpose of preventing the sale. Dono
van says that his company approved
the plan for an extension of the road
across the mountains to Spokane and
the extension to Blaine, in this county.

SAN JOSE. March 14. â Experts are
at wo'rk on the books of the City
Treasurer's office to get definite fig
urea on the shortage of ex-Treasurer
McGeoghegan. As soon as they report
<*orne new developments are expected.
District Attorney Campbell has ad
vised Treasurer H. D. Mathews to
make a formal written demand upon
McGeoghegun for whatever public
moneys that should be in the treasury
and that have not been turned over
to him. This is believed to be a pre-
Uminary move to a prosecution
against McGeoghegan.
The friends of the ex-Treasurer are
still trying to raise the necessary
money to meet the defalcation, but it
is doubtful whether they can get the
cash. A private detective still accom
panies MeGeoghegan. The Grand
Jury is to be drawn on March 28, at
Â¦which time they meet and organize,
and it is said that the condition of the
treasury of the city will be taken up.

c!sion bej-end *uth -Â«mall trading as has been
dena each week only to be cleaned up as socn
as the tessiicn of the court jevcaled a further
portponerr.ent.
In to-da^s market traders of this class had
set about covering their short contracts before
noon, having come to a belief that another
postponement \vaÂ« to be made. The announce
ment l f the actual decision caused a sharp
break, i but prices subsequently rallied to the
highest of the day, which was well above Sat
urday's level. The evidence of support in
Northern Securities stock Jtuclf on the curb
helped to rally the general market. The sub
sequent feverish fluctuations seemed largeiy
due to the efforts of traders to find the prev
alent tendency of the market- The tendency
became more distinctly downward as the
sweeping character of the decision began td
become clear from the constantly published
bulletins. All sources of news were besieged
with extraordinary Interest. The tenor of the
ceffiment was taken to mean that the large in
terests concerned were not likely to take pre
cipitate stock market action on the strength
of. hasty bulletins by telegraph. The quiet
and dullness into which the market fell late In
the day after the bulletins had brought the
last of tbe opinions as they were read tended
to confirm aa impression that the necessary
adjustment to the conditions formed by the
decision had been largely made before Its de
livery. The day's net changes In prices were
almost whogy inslenificant in Flace and t?ie
market became practically Inactive at the last.
Other influences were ignored. Among these
were the United States Steel Corporation's an
nual report, an improved tone of speculation
in foreiiro markets and a rather more strong
railway traffic.
Bonds were lrrerular. Total sales, $2,000,-
United States bonds were unchanged on call.
Three cart of. Western Poultry were on sal*
and met with a >teady demand at good prices.
There was practically no market for domestic
stock, receipts being light and the demand like
wise. Receipts of Game were unusually large
for Monday and, aa the demand was light,
prices of several kinds were lower.

Lieutenant Burnett, however, plead
ed "not guilty." and called Captain
Norman, chief clerk to the Chief of Po
lice, to the stand to prove that the lat
ter had given him permission to visit
Alameda County on the afternoon of
March 5. Chief Wittman testified that
he had vested Norman with authority
to grant leaves of absence during his
absence, but in the face of this. Bur
nett was found guilty and must forfeit
half a month's pay. The same action
was taken in the other cases.
Special Officer P. D. Linville, who
has been a familiar figure on Kearny
street for the last twenty years, was
deprived of his star, it being found
that he had not performed his duty in
detaining a man who had assaulted
Captain of Police Thomas Duke. The
captain was in citizen's clothes when
he became involved in a struggle while
attempting to : quell a disturbance, and
one man that kicked and threw him
started to run away. Linville cap
tured this man.* but released him from
custody before the captain could re
gain his feet. .
In extenuation "of the offense, each
patrolman offered an excuse. Some said
they went across the bay for recrea
tion, it being their time off .duty, others
that they had "tips" and desired to
play, and more that they thought that
their time, when not spent in serving
the city, was their own and subject
to their own pleasure. They all plead
ed guilty to having violated section 1
of rule 30, which provides that no po
lice officer shall leave the city without
permission. The testimony of the cap
tains showed the accused to be ex
cellent officers, and for a time it ap
peared that the Commissioners would
pass the offense with a reprimand.
PLEADS "NOT GUILTY." .
On March 5 the various police cap
tains visited the race track for the
purpose of trapping policemen who at
tended it. They found Patrolmen
John A. Annear, John J. Crowley,
Peter J. W'halen, Thomas F. Byrne,
Patrick Curry. .John L. Mangan, John
B. Collins, Patrick B. Mahoney, Jere
miah M. Dwyer and Lieutenant Jo
seph J. Burnett on the ..premises and
reported the same to Chief Wittman.
On their reports charges were pre
ferred against the various men and
their cases were called last night.
The particular charge upon which
the men were convicted was leaving
the city and county of San Francisco
without permission from the Chief of
Police. All of the patrolmen pleaded
guilty to the accusation and threw them
selves on the mercy of the beard after
having made an explanation. Lieuten
ant Burnett, however, who is one of
the best officers on the force and who
is next in line for the rank of captain,
pleaded not. guilty to the charge and
produced testimony in support ol his
denial. Notwithstanding this he was
convicted and fined with the others who
appeared before the commission.
OFFENDERS ARE TRAPPED.
The Board of Police Commissioners
at a. meeting last night passed sen
tence upon nine patrolmen and one
lieutenant of police who visited the
Emeryville racetrack on" the afternoon
of March 5. Each' of the men was fined
a half month's pay. which amounts to
$50 In the case of each patrolman and
$70 In the case of the lieutenant.
The proposition was accepted and
the new register of the hotel was soon
christened with tWe- first ink used in
the house. Seven famijies occupied
apartments in the hotel last night and
found their temporary needs attended
to by the beilboy and watchman, who
were intrusted with the care of the
establishment during the night. Next
Monday the stockholders and direct
ors of the hotel will give a dinner in
the hotel, and at 8 d'clock the St.
Francis will enter upon itc business
career in San Francisco.
A bellboy, temporarily endowed
with the dignity of a night clerk, and
a watchman, hurriedly pressed into
service for the occasion, stood a lone
ly watch in the new St. Francis Hotel
last night. Unexpectedly yesterday
Manager Allan Pollok of the magnifi
cent new hostelry, found himself a
full-fledged boniface. He had ar
ranged for a formal opening of the
hotel next Monday evening, but a mis
take in the original advertising mat
ter sent out by the hotel management
had announced that the opening
would take place March 1.
As a result a number of people from
Southern California and other points,
who had decided. to make their abode
at the St. Francis, proceeded thither
when they arrived here yesterday.
Their disappointment following the
explanation they received from Chief
Clerk McDermott that the hotel was
hot yet opened to the^ public appealed
to Manager Pollok. who finally agreed
to room them provided they would be
contented with rooms and icewater
only, the caterer's department not
being ready to accommodate guests.

Neither have the resources of th*

Chief honors go to Mr. Durkln and

â Ccnried fashion â summon the loiter

occasion, also Conried-wise, but very
modestly. There is still a moment's
grace and then the call is repeated.
All those that are not then seated re
main outside until the close of the act.
The trumpet theme is now taken up
by the orchestra and the Wagtier-
K3ein-Murphy "Parsifal" begins.
Mr. Kline has done his work well
after due survives the shock of Its being
done at all. He ' has arranged the
Wagner music to fit the Alcazar
measure very aptly, and the manage
ment has done its duty with a con
siderably enlarged ' orchestra. Mr.
Murphy's part is the condensing of the
libretto, that has also been done "with
deft hand. The original wording has
been almost exactly retained. A few
apparent Murphyisras, however, have
<rÂ»=pt in, such as "the time has come,"
but the diction, on the whole, is thor
oughly dignified and impressive. The
story, toe, is told with admirable clear
ness, the cuts havipg been made with
bold and judicious hand, and all the
salient features retained. In three acts
and six scenes the play is arranged, and
some two and a half out of the Conried
Fix hours or so of its length are shorn
off between the shears of Mr. Murphy
and Mr. Klein. ...

scened and costumed, the cast is "a
large one and a number of clever
specialties, are introduced. Herschel
Mayall, as Shamus, made a pronounced
hit. entering into the full spirit of the
role of the bold, quick-witted rebel of
'98. Mayall's versatility is unquestion
able, since last week he shone to ad
vantage in a Dutch part and now has
proved equally good In Irish character.
"Shamus O'Brien" contains a whole lot
of rollicking fun, but there are sev
eral pathetic incidents in the piece and
a number of thrilling climaxes.
Eugenia Thais Lawton, as O'Brien's
betrothed, made a captivating heroine,
and ?.lyrtle Vane had a soubrette part
that fitted her like a glove and she
sang "Come Rack to Erin" charming
ly. Georgie Woorlthorpe, as Mrs.
O'Brien, gave a first-rate character
portrayal, while Ernest Howell, as the
informer, had a part that brought
down upon him the hisses of the gal
lery, but hisses are always compli
mentary to the villain. Edwin T.
Emery did one of his best stunts in
the ro!e of a silly Cockney. Henry
Shumer, whose part is that of a British
officer, wao given a hearty welcome, it
being his first appearance since his re
cent illness.; Irish Jigs and reels are
cleverly danced by members of the
Gaelic Dancing Club, and the rendition
of Irish national airs by the orchestra
was a highly appreciated feature.^ As
St. Patrick's Day occurs this week,
"Shamus O'Brien" is a timely offer
ing, and the Central is certain to do
a 'prosperous business with the merit
orious production.
The proposed Democratic dinner in
San Francisco, under the auspices of
the Montlcello Club, is still in the air.
Leading lights of the Jefferaonian
League are not positive that the feast
will be spread before the middle of
April.
Ex-Governor Budd was a recent call
er at the political headquarters in the

of California on the Democratic Na
tional Committee. M. F. Tarpey, or
ganizer of the , Hearst forces on the
Pacific Coast, is out of town. Al Mur
phy represents the organization in the
absence of Mr. Tarpey.
There is some talk to the effect that
the Democrtic State convention will bÂ»
called to meet Wednesday, May 11. Al
McCabe. secretary of the committee,
fancies that the apportionment of rep
resentation will be made on the basfs
of the vote cast for Franklin K. Lane
in 1902. On the representation of one
delegate to every 200 votes cast for
Lane, the strength of the convention
will approximate 700. >
There may be a lively three-cornered
contest between San Jose, Santa Cruz
and Sacramento for the privilege of en
tertaining the delegates. The citizens
of Santa Cruz are holding out special
inducements to win. the favor of the
committee.
There are many indications that the
meeting of the Democratic State Oen
tral Committee at Pioneer Hall next
Saturday afternoon will be largely at

will be small. There is a good deal of
activity at Hearst headquarters In the
Grand Hotel.. The Hearst boomers do
not conceal their desire for an early

Fact* About the American Indian's
Healthy K&lr.
The American Indian, accustomed from
tim-; Immemorial to go bareheaded In all
kinds of weather, is never troubled with
falling hair or baldness.
The close atmosphere caused by ov4
"civilized" headgear is conducive to thV
breeding of infinitesimal germs which
dig Into the scalp and thrive on the sap
of the hair root.
This true cause of baldness Is of recent
discovery and explains the non-success
of all hair vigors which treated baldness
as a functional disorder.
Newbro's Herpicide Is a direct exter-
minator of the germ.' It destroys the
cause and permits the hair to grow as
nature intended.
