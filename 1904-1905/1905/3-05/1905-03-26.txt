FROM the years 1894 to .. Holmes ,
elusive, Mr. Sherlock Holmes
was a very htujr, man. It is safe
i. J - > to say that â  the-e â¢ was â¢no ; public -
'T "- case of any", difficulty In which .
he was not consulted ; during those ;:
eight year*, and there were hundreds
of private cases, seme of: them of the,
jnost intricate and extraordinary char
acter, in V which he played a prominent
part. Many startling successes and a
few unavoidable failures were the out
come of this long neiioU of continuous
work. As 1 have preserved very full
notes of all these cases â¢ and was : my
* self personally engaged in many ."of-,
â  them, it may be imagined that it is no
easy task to know. which I should se
lect to lay before the public. I shall, ",:-,
however, preserve my former rule and i
, give the preference to" those cases .
which derive their interest. nc-t so much
from the brutality of the crime as from
the ingenuity and dramatic quality of
the solution. For this reason I . will
now lay before the reader the facU â¢
connected with Miss Violet Smith, the.;
Â« solitary cyclist of Charlington, arid the
curious sequel of our s investigation, '
which culminated in unexpected trag
edy. It is true that the circumstance ;
did not admit of an* striking illustra : .
tlon of those powers "for which my
friend Â»as famous, but there ; were
some points about the case which made
It stand out in those long records -of ;
crime from which I' gather the ma
terial for these little narratives. . /, â¢'
On referring to my note-book for the
year W5 I find that it was upon Sat-,
urday. the 23rd of April, that we first
heard of Miss Violet Smith. Her viÂ«it
v.as, I remember, extremely unwelcome
to Holmes, for he was Immersed : at the
0 moment In a very abstruse and com
plicated problem concerning the pecu l
liar persecution' to which John Vincent
Harden, the well-known tobacco' mil
lionaire, had be<.n subjected.' My
friend, who loved above all things pre
cision and concentration of thought, re
sented anything .which -distracted his
attention from the matter *in i hand.
And yet. without a- "harshness which
was foreign to his nature;' it v.as im- .
poss. to refuse to listen to the story
of the young and beautiful woman* tall.
graceful and ; queenly, * who" presented ;
herself at Baker i street late â¢in the
evening and Implored ,his assistance
And advice. It was vain to urge that
his time was already fully occupied,
for the young lady had come' with the
determination to tell her story, v and it
v. as evident that nothing short'of force
could get ' her out of the f room â  until
ehe-had done, so. With a resigned air
and a somewhat weary smile' Holmes
begged the beautiful intruder to take
a seat and to inform \us whaT it was
that was troubling, her. ,' â¢ .; ;^'^
"At least it cannot be. your health,"
said he. as his keen eyes darted over
her; so ardent a bicyclist must be
full of energy." ,' ,
She glanced down in surprise 'at her ;
own feet and I observed the . slight
roughening of the side of "' the sole
caused by the friction of the edge of
the pedal. - '" ''i~"''\i
"Yes," T bicycle -a.* good ~ deal, ' Mr. -
Holmes and that has something to . do
with mr. visit to you to-day." .
My friend took the lady's ungloved
hand, and examined' it with as close
an attention an" as. little sentiment as ;
a scientist would show to a specimen.
"You will excuse me,' I am cure. ;, lt Â»
is my business." said be. as he dropped
1 it. "I nearly fell into the error bud- â â .

course, it is obvious that *it is music. .

what has" happened to you, near Farn
ham, on the borders of Surrey?" . .-:'<â 
.'.i; The, young lady, with great clearness
and composure, ; made the | following
curious statement: ,'.'â ':-: â¢".:>*
â¢:. â¢My father dead, Mr. Holmes. He
was , James' Smith, who conducted the
orchestra at the old Imperial ' Theater.'
Sly mother and I": were . left .without a
relation in the '.world -except one uncle.
Ralph Smith, who weiit Ito Africa
twenty-five years ago, and .-* we have
T)\ -ver had a word from 'â¢'. him since.
When fath< r - died 'â¢ we,.- were left ; very
P or, but one c*iy we were told that
there was an ; advertisement in the
Times, inquiring for our whereabouts.
You can imagine how excited, we were,
for. we thought that some one had left
â us : a fortune. ; We went at once to the
lawyer whose name was given in " the
paper. There we â : me t " two geotnvnen,
Mr. Carruthers and Mr. Woodley, who
were c homo on a visit , from South
Africa. They said that my uncle was
a friend of theirs, .that he; had died
some . months , before ; ir. jrrea,t : poverty
in Johannesburg:, and that he had ask-,
ed them with his ; last breath to hunt
up his relations, and see '"â â  that they
were in no want. It seemed strange to
us that Uncle' Ralph, who took no no
tice. of us when he . was alive, should
be so. careful. to look after us when he
was -dead,- but Mr. Carruthers explained
that the I reason was that my uncle
had v just v heard .of- the , death of his
â  brother, and so felt responsible for our
fate.'.' ; .. .^ ; - . .- - : ' .
â i "Excuse me," said Holmes. "When
was. this interview?" â¢.-. . ;
â  "Last Decemberâ four months aco.' 1
, "Pray proceed." , . ;. . â¢; . â..
"Mr. Woodley seemed to me to be a
most' odious person., He was forever
making eyes at meâ a . coarse, puffy- \
raced. . redrmoustached young man.
with' his hair plastered "down en â¢ each
â¢side vof his forehead. I thought that
he ; was perfectly hatefulâ and iI \ was
sure that Cyril; would not wish me to
know- such a person." :. , .
./.."Oh," Cyril 'is. his name!" said Holmes,
smiling-. ';â¢ - ';:'.. â¢; â¢ â .
The young lady blushed and laughed.
- "Yes, Mr. Holmes, Cyril Morton an
electrical engineer, and we hope to be
married at. the end [, of the summer >
Dear me. -how did I get talking about
him?; What: I wished to say was that
Mr. Woodley was perfectly odious, but
"that 1 Mr. Carruthers, who was a much
older man, was more agreeable. ; Ht
was a dark, sallow, '-.clean-shaven,';
silent person. r but he had po- ;
lite manners \ and t a pleasant
smile. "He ' inquired how
we were left, and on find- '
ing that we were left very r .
poor, he â¢â¢ suggested \ that I
shculd | come j and teach music-
! to his : only daughter, : aged 10 \
1 said that I' did not like to leave
my mother.' on which he ,' suggested .
that -^ I v should ": go home ? to her
every J week-end, and ,t he ' â  offered
me a hundred a year, which" was cer
tainly ; splendid , pay. v So ." It r ended Sby
my accepting, and I went down to Chil
tern Grange, about six miles from Farn
liam. Mr. Carruthers was a widower,
but he' had engaged a lady housekeeper,
a very respectable,' j | elderly v person,
called } Mrs. Dixon, :to 1 look after his
establishment;;; The r . child" was a dear,
and ,; everything promised * well. s Mr.
Carruthers 'I was 1 very t kind "â : and t, very
â  musical, and we - had most pleasant
evenings together. Every Â* week-end I
went - home ito - my mother in town. v ,C
"The first flaw in my happiness was
! the ' arrival â¢of the red-moustached Mr.
Woodley. He came for a:; visit r.of* a
week, and oh! It seemed three month*
ta. me. -^ He, was "; a dreadful personâ a
bully to every one else, but to me some
thing infinitely worse. He made odious
; love : to me, boasted of his wealth, said
that if . I married t him I could < have , the
finest diamonds \in London, and finally
when ;I ; would have ; nothing' to do with
. him he seized me ;in â  his } arms one day
after dinnerâ he was hideously strongâ
. and \ swore that : . he would l not let me ;go
until 'I; had ; kissed him. Mr. , Carruthers
came in . and tore ? him from me, \on
* which he turned ; upon '< his i own host,
knocking him down and 7 cutting,' bis
1 face 1 open. .That was ,i the , ; , end of \ his
visit, ;as you >â can } Imagine, r" Mr. / Car
; ruthers apologized Ito me : next day,l and
-, assured Lme that I should S never he ex
posed to such an insult again. I have
not seen Mr. Woodley si ace. ; ''-;â¢;:
' ".And now, Mr. Hohnes, I come }at
A. CONAN DOYLE
last to the special thing which has
caused me to ask your advice to-day.
You must know that every Sunday
forenoon I ride on my bicycle to Farn
ham Station, in order to get the 1:1:22'
to town. The " road* from Chiltern
Grange is a lonely one, and at ope spot
it is particularly bo, for. it lies for over
a mile between Charlington Heath up
on one side and the woods which iia :
round Chaningion Hall upon the other.
You could not rind a more lonely tract
of road anywhere, and it is quite rare
to meet so much as a cart, or a peasant,
until you reach the high road near
Crooksbury Hill. Two weeks ago I
was passing this place, when I chanced
to look back over my shoulder, and
about two hundred yards behind me I
saw a man, also on a bicycle. He
seemed to be a middle-aged man, with
a short, dark beard. I looked back be
fore I reached Farnham, but the man
was gone, so I thought no more about
it. But you can imagine how surprised
I was, Mr. Holmes, when, on my return
en the Monday, I saw the same man on
the same stretch of road. My aston
ishment was increased when the inci
dent occurred again, exactly as before,
on the following Saturday and Monday.
He always kept his distance and did
not molest me in any way, but still It
certainly v.as very odd. I mentioned
it to Mr. Carruthers, who seemed inter
ested in what I said, and told me that
he had ordered a horse and trap, so
that- in future I should: not pass over
these; lonely roads without : some com
panion. % â  â  '.;â ':'. Â;y â â ;-..;-. /ââ¢*> rrV, : i - ;?:?- : -:" ; '-â >;â¢*^i
y "The . horse I and â¢ trap were to have
me â : this ; week,", but 3 for ! tome reason
they .'.were not delivered, and again I
had to , cycle to ; the - station.. That "wag
this : morning. : You can think > that 1
looked' out when I came; to Charllngton
Heath, and ' there, sure; enough, i was thu
man, exactly as he had been the r two
weeks "before.: He always kept so. far
from; me that I : could not clearly sea
his face, but it was. certainly some one
v, hum 1 ; 1 did not know. He â¢ was dressed
in a dark suit with cloth cap. The
only ! thing ; about his faca that' I could :
clearly, see ;; was \ his dark i beard. To
day I was not alarmed, Jaui 1 w&a ! ailed!
with curiosity, and I determined to find:
out who â¢he was ! and what 'he * wanted.
Ti slowed down my machine, but ho
plowed down his. Then I stopped alto
gether, but he stopped Then I
laid r a â  trap for him. :^ There is \ a sharp
turning of the road, aid I pedaled very I
quickly round ' this.' and k then - I stopped
and waited. I expected him to shoot
around '. and pass me â¢- before * he ; could \
stop. â '. -.7 But : he ; never -appeared.. T Then
I went : back ' and looked â¢: round : the
coiner. ,r could sr-e a mile of road, but.
he : was not â¢-. on ..it. ; To make it the
more extraordinary, there was; no side
road' at this point down which he could
have gone." :>-'"^-'.--. --'.v^-;-' -'.'.'" "".-- â  : -' i .-i-v---* : ' ;

hands. â¢ i "This case certainly . pre

, "So, by the process
of exclusion, we. arrive
at the, 5 fact that he; mad*
his way toward . Char
lingrton Hall, which *
as I understand, Is situated in Its own
grounds on one side of the road. Any
thing else?"
"Nothing, Mr. Holmes, save that I
was so perplexed that I felt I should
not be happy until I had seen you and
had your advice."
Holmes sat in silence for some little
time.
"Where is the gentleman to whom
you are engaged?" he asked at last.
"He is in the Midland Electrical
Company, at Coventry."
"He would not pay you a surprise
visit?"
"Oh, Mr. Holmes! As if I should not
Know him!"
"Have you had any other admirers?"
"Several before I knew Cyril."
"And since?"
"There was this dreadful man. Wood
ley, if you can call him an admirer."
"No one else?"
Our fair client seemed a little con
fused.
"Who was he?" asked Holmes.
"Oh, It may be a mere fancy of mine;
but it had seemed to me sometimes
that my employer, Mr. Carruthero,
takes a great deal of interest In me.
We are thrown rather together. I play
his accompaniments in the evening.
He has never said anything. He is a
perfect gentleman. But a girl always
knows." â  â  ,
"Ha!" Holmes' looked grave. "What
does he do for a living?"
"He is a rich man."
"No carriages or horses?"
"Well, at least he is fairly well-to-do.
But he goes into the city two or three
times, a week. He is deeply interested
in South African gold shares."
"You will let me know any fresh de
velopment, Miss Smith. I am very
busy Juat now, but I will find time to
make some Inquiries into your case. In
the meantime, take no â¢Â« without
letting me know. Good-by, and I trust
that we shall have nothing but good
news from you."
"It Is part of the settled order of
nature that such a girl should have
followers," said Holmes,, as he pulled
at his meditative pipe, "but for choice
not on bicycles in lonely country roads.
Some secretive lover, beyond all doubt.
But there are curious and suggestive
details about the case, Watson."
"That he should appear only at that
point?"
"Exactly. Our first effort must be to
find v.-ho are the tenants of Chsaington
Hall. Then, -again, how auout Uxe con
nection between Carruthers and Wood
ley, since they appear to be men
of such a different type? How came
they both to he so keen upon looking
up Ralph Smith's relations? One more
point. What sort of a menage is it
which pays double the market price
for a governess, but does not keep a
horse, although six miles from tha
station? Odd, Watson â very odd!"' â
"You will eto down?"
â 'No, my dear fellow, you â will go
down, This.may be some trifling: In
trigue, and I cannot break my other
Important research for the sake of It.
On Monday you will 1 arrive early at
Farnham; you wll! conceal yourself
near Charllnglon Heath; you will
observe these facts ' for yourself and
act as your cAva judgment advises.
Then, having Inquired as to the occu-"
ps.nti* of. the hall, you vill come back
to me and report. And now, Watson,
not another word of the matter until
we have a few solid stepping-stones on
which we may hope to get across to
our solution."
We had ascertained from the lady
that she went flown upon the Monday
by the train which leaves Waterloo
at 9:50, so I started early and caught
the" 9:13. At Farnham Station I had
no difficulty In being directed to
Charlington Heath. It was Impossible
to mistake the scene of the young
lady's adventure, for the road runs
between the open heath on one side
and an old yew hedge upon the other,
surrounding a park which is studded
-with magnificent trees. There waa *

with some heat.
"Gone to the nearest public house.

that, either. That the hall is tenanted
by Williamson. Who's the better for
that? Well, well, my dear air, don't
look so depressed. We can do little
more until next Saturday, and in the

Next morning: we had a note from
Miss Smith, recounting shortly and ac
curately the very Incidents which!
had seen, but the pith of the letter lay
In the postscript: i

"Our young friend seems to be get

thoughtfully, as he finished the letter.

ThÂ» Thursday brought us another let
ter from our client.
"You will not be surprised, Mr.
Holmes, said she, "to hear that I am
leaving Mr. Carruthers' employment.
Even the high pay cannot reconcile me
to the discomforts of my situation. On
Saturday I come to town, and I do not
Intend to return. Mr. Carruthers has
got a trap, and so the dangers of the
lonely road, if there ever were any dan
gers, are n6tv over.
"As Â£o the special cause of my leav

tion with Mr. Carruthers, but it is the
reappearance of that odious man, Mr.
Woodley. He was always hideous, but
he looks more awful than ever now.
for he appears to have had an accident,
end he is much disfigured. I saw him
out of the window, but I am glad to
say I did not meet him. He had a
long talk with Mr. Carruthers, who
seemed much â¢ excited afterward.
Woodley must be staying In the neigh
borhood, for he did not sleep here, and
yet I caught a glimpse of him again
this morning, slinking about the
shrubbery. I would sooner have a sav
age wild animal loose about the place.
I loathe and fear him more than I can
say. How can Mr. Carruthers endure
such a creature fora moment? How
ever, all my troubles will be over on
Saturday."
"So 1 trust, Watson, so I trust," said
Holmes, gravely. ."There is some deep
Intrigue going on round that little
woman, and it is our duty to see that

I confess that I had not up to now
taken a very serious view of the case,
which had seemed to me rather gro
tesque and bizarre than dangerous.
That a man should lie in wait for and
follow a very handsome woman is no
unheard-of thing, and if he has. so
little audacity that he not only dared
not address her, but even fled from her
approach, he was not a very formid
able assailant. The ruffian Woodley
was a very different person, but, ex
oept on one occasion, he had not mo
ltfted our client, and now he visited
the house of Carruthers without in
truding upon her presence. The man
on the bicycle was doubtless a member
of those week-end parties at the Hall
of which the publican had spoken,
but who he was, or what he wanted,
was as obscure as ever. It was the
severity of Holmes' manner, and the
fact thai he slipped a revolver into
his pocket, before leaving: our rooms
which impressed me with .the feeling
tragedy might prove to lurk behind
this curious train of events.
A rainy night had been followed
by a glorious morning, and the heath
iovered country-side, with the glow
ing clumps of flowering gorse, seemed
all the more beautiful to eyes which
were weary of the duns and drabs
and slate-grays of London. Holmes
and I walked along the broad
sandy ro^d inhaling the fresh morn
ing air, and rejoicing in the music *of
the bird* and the fresh breath of the
spring. From a rise of the road on
the ehoulder of Crooksbury Hill we
could see the grim Hall bristling out
from amid the ancient oaks, which,
old as they were, were still younger,
than the building which they sur
rounded. Holmes pointed down the
long tract of road which wound, a red
difih yellow band, between the brown
of the heath and the budding: green
of the woods. Far away, a black dot,
we could see a vehicle moving in our
direction. Holmes gave an exclama
tion of impatience.
"I have given a margin of half an
hour," eai<? he. "If that is her trap,
she must be making for the earlier
Â»pqiiÂ». I f Â°;ir. Watson, that she will
be past Charlington before we can
possibly meet her."
From the instant that we passed the
rise we could no longer see the ve
hicle, but we hastened onward at
such a pace that my sedentary life
began to tell upon me, and I was com
pelled to fall behind. Holmes, how
ever, was always in training, for he .
had inexhaustible stores of nervous
energy upon which to draw. His
springy step never slowed until sud
denly, when he was a hundred yards*
in front of me. he halted, and I saw
him throw up his hand with a gesture
of grief and despair. At the same
instant an empty dog-cart, the horse
(. entering-, the reins trailing, appeared
round the curve of the road and rat
tled swiftly toward us.
"TÂ«o late, Watson, too late!" cried
Holmes, as I ran panting to his side.
"Fool that I was, not to allow for that
earlier train! It's abduction, Watson
â abduction! Murder! Heaven knows
what! Block the road! Stop the horse!
That's right. Now, jump in, and let
us see if I can repair the consequences
of my own blunder."
Wp had sprung into the dog-cart,
and Holmes, after turning the horse,
gave it a sharp cut with the whip,
and we flew back along the road. As
we turned the curve the whole stretch
of road between the Hall and heath
was opened up. I grasped Holmes'
arm.
"That's the man!" I gasped.
A solitary cyclist was coming toward
us. His head was down and his
shoulders rounded, as he put every
ounce of energy that he possessed on
to the pedals. He was flying like a
racer. Suddenly he raised his bearded
face, saw us close to him, and pulled
up, springing from his machine. That
coal-black beard was in singular con
trast to the pallor of his face, and his
eyes were as bright as if he had a
fever. He stared at us and at the dog
cart. Then a look of amazement came
over his face.
"Halloa! Stop there!" he shouted,
holding his bicycle to block our road.
"Where did you get that dog-cart?
Pull up, man! he yelled, drawing a
pistol from his sid._ pocket. "Pull up,
I Bay, or, by George, I'll put a bullet
into your horse."
Holmes threw the reins into my lap,
and sprang down from the cart.
"You're the man we want to see.
Where is Miss Violet Smith?" he said,
in his quick, clear way.
"That's what I'm asking you. You're
in her dog-cart. You ought to know
where she is."
"We met the dog-cart on the road.
There was no one in it. We drove
back to help the young lady."
"Good Lord! Good Lord! what shall
I do?" cried the stranger, in an
ecstasy of despair. "They've got her,
that hell-bound Woodley and the
blackguard parson. Come man, come,
if you really are her friend. Stand by
me and we'll save her, if 1 have to
leave my carcass in Charlington
Wood."
He ran distractedly, his pistoi in his
hand, toward a gap in the hedge.
Holmes followed him. and I, leaving
the horse grazing beside the road, fol
lowed Holmes.
"This iÂ« where they came through,"
said he, Anting to the marks ol sev
eral feet upon the muddy path.
"Halloai Stop a minute! Who's this in
the bush?"
It Was a young fellow about seven
teen, dressed like an 'ostler, with
leather cords and gaiters. He lay upon
his back, his kn-.-es drawn viÂ», a terri-
bie cut upon his head. He was In
sensible, but alive. A glance at his
wound told me that it had not pene
trated the bone.
"That's Peter, the groom," cried the
stranger. "He drove her. The beasts
have pulled him off and clubbed him.
Let him lie; we can't do him any good,
but we may save her from the worst
fate that can befall a woman."
We ran frantically down the path,
â¢which wound among the trees. We had
reached the shrubbery which sur
rounded the house when Holmes pulled
up.
"They didn't so to the house. Here
are their marks on the leftâ here, be
side the laurel bushes. Ah! I said so."
As he spoke, a woman's shrill scream
âa scream which vibrated with a,
frenzy or horrorâ burst from the thick,
green clump of bushes in front of us.
It ended suddenly on its highest note
with a choke and a gurgle.
"This way! This way! They are in
the bowling-alley," cried the stranger,
darting through the bushes. "Ah, the
cowardly dogs! Follow me, gentlemen!
Too late! too late! by the living Jingo!"
We had broken suddenly into a lovely
glade of greensward surrounded by an
cient trees. On the farther side of it,
under the shadow of a mighty oak,
there stood a singular group of three
people. One was a woman, our client,
drooping and faint, a handkerchief
round her mouth. Opposite her stood
a brutal, heavy-faced, red-moustached
THE SAN " FRANCISCO SUNDAY ' CALL.
young man, his gaitered legs
parted wide, one arm akimbo,
the other waving a riding
erpp, his whole attitude suggestive of
triumphant bravado. Between them an
elderly gray-bearded man, wearing a
short surplice over a light tweed suit,
had evidently just completed the wed
ding service, for he pocketed his
prayer-book as we appeared, and
slapped the sinister bridegroom upon
the back in Jovial congratulation.
"They're married!" I gasped.
'"Come on!" cried our guide; "come
on!" He rushed across the glade,
Holmes and I at his heels. As we ap
proached the lady staggered against
the trunk of the tree for support. Wil
liamson, the ex-clergyman, bowed to
us with mock politeness, and the bully,
Woodley, advanced with a shout of
brutal and exultant laughter.
"You can take your beard off, Bob,"
said he. "I know you, right enough.
Well, you and your pals have just come
in time for me to be able to introduce
you to Mrs. Woodley."
Our guide's answer was a singular
one. He snatched off the dark beard
which had disguised him and threw it
on the ground, disclosing a long, sal
lew, clean-shaven face below it. Then
he raised his revolver and covered the
young ruffian, who was advancing up
on him with his dangerous riding-crop
swiuging in his hand.
"Yes," eaid our ally, "I am Bob Car
ruthers, and I'll see this woman
righted, if I have to swing for it. I
told you what I'd do if you molested
her, and, by the Lord! I'll be as good
as my word."
"You're too late. She's my wife."
"No, she's your widow."
His revolver cracked, and I saw the
blood spurt from the front of Woodley's
waistcoat. He spun round with a
scream and fell upon his back, his
hideous red face turning suddenly to a
dreadful mottled pallor. The old man,
still clad in his surplice burst into
such a string or roui oaths as I have
never heard, and pulled out a revolver
of his own, but, before he could raise
it, he was looking down the barrel of
Holmes' weapon.
"Enough of this," Bald my friend,
coldly. "Drop that pistol! Watson,
pick it upl Hold it to his headl Thank
you. You, Carruthers, give me that
revolver. We'll have no more violence.
Come, hand it over!"
"Who are you, then?'*
"My name Is Sherlock Holmes."
"Good Lord!"
"You have heard of me, I see. I will
represent the official police until their
arrival. Here, you!" he shouted to a
frightened groom, who had appeared
at the edge of the glade. "Come here.
Take this note, as hard as you can
ride, to Farnham." He scribbled a few
words upon a leaf from his notebook.
"Give it to the superintendent at the
police station. Until he comes, I must
detain you all under my personal cus
tody."
The strong, masterful personality of
Holmes dominated the tragic scene, and
all were equally puppets in his hands.
Williamson and Carruthers found
themselves carrying the wounded
Woodley into the house, and I gave
my arm to the frightened girl. Tha
injured man was laid on his bed, and
at Holmes' request I examined him.
I carried my report to where he sat In
the old tapestry-hung dining-room with
his two prisoners before him.
|]He will live," said I.
"What!" cried Carruthera, springing
out of his chair. 'I'll go upstairs and
finish him first. Do you tell me that
that girl, that angel, is to be tied to
Roaring Jack Woodley for life?"
"You need not concern yourself
about that," said Holmes. "There
are two very good reasons why she
should, under no circumstances, be
his wife. In the first place, we are
very safe in questioning Mr. William
son s right to solemnije a marriage."
"I have been ordained," cried the
old rascal.
"And also unfrocked."
"Once a clergyman, always a cler
gyman."
"I think not. How about the li
cense?"
"We had a license for the marriage.
I have it here in my pocket."
"Then you got it by a trick. But,
in any case, a forced marriage is no
marriage, but it is a very serious fel
ony, as you will discover before you
have finished. You'll have time to
think the point out during the next
ten years or so, unless I am mistaken.
As to you, Carruthers, you would have
done better to keep your pistol in
your pocket."
"I begin to think so, Mr. Holmes,
but when I thought of all the precau
tion I had taken to shield this girl â
for I loved her, Mr. Holmes, and' it
is the only time that ever I knew
what love was â it fairly drove me
mad to think that she was in the pow
er of the greatest brute and bully in
South Africa â a man whose name is
a holy terror from Klmberley to Jo
hannesburg. Why, Mr. Holmes,
you'll hardly believe it, but ever since
that girl has been in my employment
I never once let her go past this
house, where I knew the rascals were
lurking, without following her on my
bicycle, just to see that she came to
no harm. I kept my distance from
her, and I wore a beard, so that she
should not recognize me, for she is a
good and high-spirited girl, and she
wouldn't have stayed in my employ
ment long if she had thought that
I was following her about the country
roads."
"Why didn't you tell her of her
ianger?"
"Because, then, again, she would
have left me, and I couldn't bear to
face that. Even if she couldn't love
me, it was a great deal to me just to
see her dainty form about the house,
and to hear the sound of her voice."
"Well," said I, "you call that love,
Mr. Carruthers, but I should call it
selfishness."
"Maybe the two things go together.
Anyhow. I couldn't let her go. Be
sides, with this crowd about, it was
well that she should have some one
near to look after her. Then, waen
the cable came, I ' knew they were
bound to make a move."
"What cable?"
Carruthers took a telegram from
his pocket.
"That's it," said he.
It was short and concise: â
"The old man is dead."
"Hum!" said Holmes. "I think I
see how things worked, and I can un
derstand how this message would, as
you say, bring them to a head. But
while you wait, you might tell me
what you can."
The old reprobate with the surplice
burst into a volley of bad language.
"By Heaven:" said he, 'if you
squeal on us, Bob Carruthers, I'll
serve you as you served Jack Wood
ley. You can bleat about the girl to
your heart's content, for that's your
own affair, but if you round on your
pals to this plain-clothes copper, it
will be the worst day's work that ever
you did."
"Your reverence need not be ex
cited," said Holmes, lighting a cig
arette. "The case is clear enough
against you, and all I ask is a few de
tails for my private curiosity. - How
ever, if there's any difficulty in your
telling me, I'll do the talking, and
then you will see how far you have a
chance of holding back your secrets.
In the first place, three of you
came from South Africa on this game
âyou Williamson, you Carruthers, and
Woodley."
"Lie number onetf* said the old man;
"I never saw either of them until two
months ago, and I have never been In
Africa in my life, so you can put that
in your pipe and smoke It, Mr. Busy
body Holmes!"
"What he says is true," said Car
ruthers.
'â¢Well, well, two of you came over.
His reverence is our own home-made
article. You had known Ralph Smith
in South Africa. You had reason to
believe he would not live lone. You
found out that his niece would inherit
his fortune. How's thatâ eh?"
Carruthers r.odded and Williamson
swore.
"She was next of kin, no doubt, and,
you were aware that the old fellow
would make co will."
"Couldn't read or write," said Car
ruthers.
"do you came over the two of you.
and hunted up the girl. The Idea wu
that one of you was to marry her, and
the other have a share of the plunder.
For some reason, Woodley was chosen
as the husband. Why was that?"
"We played cards for her on the voy
age. He won."
"I see. You got the young lady into
your service, and there Woodley was to
do the courting. She recognised the
drunken brute that he was and would
have nothing to do with him. Mean
while, your arrangement was rather
upset by the fact that you had your
self fallen in love with the lady. You
ccnild no longer bear the idea of this
ruffian owning her?"
"No, by George, I couldn't!"
"There was a quarrel between you.
He left you in a rage and began to
make his own plans Independently of
you."
"It strikes me, Williamson, there
isn't very much that we can tell this
gentleman," cried Carruthers. with a
bitter laugh. "Yes, we quarreled, and
he knocked me down. I am level with
him on that, anyhow. Then I lost sight
of him. That was when he picked up
with this cast padre here. I found that
they had set up housekeeping
at th'.s place on the line that she had
to pass for the station. I kept my eye
on her after that, for I knew there was
some deviltry in the wind. I saw them
from time to time, for I was anx!ou3
to know what they were after. Two
days ago Woodley came up to my
house with this cable, which showed
, that Ralph Smith was dead. He asked
me If I would stand by the bargain. I
said I would He asked me if I
would marry the girl myself and give
him a share. I said I would willingly
tin so, but that 3he wo*M not have me.
He said. Let us get her married first.
and after a v/eek or two she may see
things a bit different.' I said I -vould
have nothing to do with violence
he went oft! cursing, like the foul
mouthed blackguard that he was, and
swearing that he would have her yet.
She was leaving me this week-end, and
I had got a trap to take her to the sta
tion, but I was so uneasy in my mind
that I followed her ,-n my bicycle 9be
had got the start, however, and before
I could catch her the mischief was
done. The first thing I knew about it
was when I saw you two gentlemen
driving back in her dog cart."
Holmes rose and tossed the end of his
cigarette into the grate. "I have beÂ«n
very obtuse, WatsÂ«..-n," said he. 'When

CHAPTER I.
The Feast of Ranuzan.
O-T COOL breeze slipped ahead of
f 1 the dawn. It blew dim the calm ,
Â£ I Greek stare, stirred the intricate
JL branches of olive trees inlaid
in the rose-pearl facade of sky, bowed
the tail, coral-lipped oleanders lining
the rivulets and crisped the soft -wash
of the gulf -tide. It lifted the strong
bronze curls on the brow of a sleeping
man who lay on the sea beach covered
with a goatskin.
George Gordon woke and looked
about him; at the pallid, ripple-edged
dunes, the murmuring clusters of reeds;
at the dead fire on which a kid had
roasted the night before; at the forms
stretched !n umber around it â Sull
otes in woolen kirtles and with shawl
girdles stuck- with silver-handled pis
tols, an uncouth and savage body
guard; at his only English companion,
John Hcbhouse. who had traveled with
him through Albania and to-morrow
was to start back to London, asleep
now with a saddle for a pillow. While
he gazed, day broke effulgent, like light
at the first hour, and the sun rose,
pouring Its crimson wine into the gob
let of the sea's blue crystal.
For a full year Gordon had roughed
it in the wilderness, sleeping one night
In a pasha's palace, the next in a cow
shed â a strange choice, it seemed, for a
peer of twenty-two, who had taken his
seat in the House vi Lords and pub
lished a book that had become the talk
of London. Yet row, as he rose to his
feet and threw back his square-set
shoulders, his colorless face and deep
gray-blue eyes whetted with keen zest.
"This is better than England." he
muttered. "How the deuce could any
body make such a world as that, I
wc-nder? For what purpose were there
ordained dandies and kings â and fel
lows of collegesâ and women of a cer
tain age â and peers â and myself, most
of all?" His thought held an instant's
.thin edge of bitterness as his look fell;
his right bc-ot had a thicker sole than
the left, and he wore an inner shoe that
laced tightly under the shrunken foot.
Stepping gingerly lest he waken his
comrade he threaded the prostrate
forms to the shambling rock path that
led. through white rushes and clumps
of cochineal cactus, to the town. A lit
. tie way along it crossed a ledge Jutting
from the heel of the hill. Under this
shelf the water had washed a deep pool
of limpid emerald. He threw off his
clothing and plunged into the tingling
6urf. He swam far out into the sea,
under the sky's lightening amethyst,
every vein beating with delight.
Before l.c came from the water the
sunrise had gilded the tops of the
mountains; while he dressed on the
rock it was kindling golden half-moons,
on the minarets of Mlssolonghi, a mile
away.
As his eyes wandered over the scene
â the strange, stern crags, the nearer
fields fcroideretl with currant bushes,
the girdling coast steeped in the wild
poignant beauty of an lonian October
âthey turned with a darker meaning to
the town, quiet enough now, though at
, sunset it had blazed with Mussulman
ffcsti%ity. while its Greek citizens hud
dled in shops and houses behind barred
doors. It was the feast of Ramazan â
at. for the Turks of daily absti
nence and nightly carousal, a long fast
for 'overs, whose infractions were pun
ished rigorously with bastinado and
with the fatal sack. Till the midnight
tolled from the mosques the shouts and
muskets of the faithful had blasted the
solitude. And this land was the ge
nius-mother of the world, in the grip
of her Turkish conqueror, who denied
her cities with his Moslem feasts and
her waters with the bodies of his
drowned victims!
Would it always be so? Gordon
thought of a roll of. manuscript in his
saddle-bag verses written on ' the
slopes, of those mountains and in the
fiery shades of these shores. Into the
pages he had woven all that old love
for this shackled nation which had
been one of the pure enthusiasms of his
youth and had grown and deepened
with his present sojourn. Would the
old spirit of Marathon ever rearise?
He went back to the sandy beach,
sat down and, drawing paper from his
pocket, began to write, using his knee
for a desk. The spell of the place and
hour was upon him. Lines flowed from

but with ancient courage overlaid,
cringing now from the wands of Turk

his face as he wrote:

He looked up. The crescents on the
spires of the town were dazzling points
of light in the gold-blue air. the morn
ing full-blown, clear and fragrant with
scents of sun and sea. In the midst of
Its -warmth and beauty he shivered.
An odd prescient sensation had come
to him like a gelid breath from the
upper ether. He started at a voice
behind him: . <..â.,- ;
"More poetry. I*ll* lay a guinea!"
Gordon did not smile. The chill was
THE CASTAWAY
still creeping in his veins. He thrust
the pap*r into his pocket as Hobhouse
threw himself down by his side.
Tht- latter noticed his expression.
"What is it?" he asked.
"Only one of my moods. I fancy.
But just before you spoke I had a
;s feeling; it was as though this
that town yonder â were tangled
in my destiny."
The barbaric servants had roused
now and a fire was cracking;.
"There's a simple remedy for that,"
the other said. "Come "back to London
with me. I swear I hate to start to
morrow without you."
Gordon shook his head. He replied
more lightly, for the eerie depression
had vanished as swiftly as it had
come:
"Not E! You'll find it the same
hedge-and-ditch oid harridan of a city
â wine, women, waxworks and weath
ercocksâthe coaches in Hyde Park,
and man milliners promenading of a
Sunday. I prefer a clear sky with
windy mares-tails, and a fine savage
race of two-legged leopards like this."
âhe pointed to the fire with its pic
turesque figures. "I'll have another
year of it, Hobhouse, before I ko back."
u'll have spawned your whole
quarto by then, no doubt!" ,
"Perhaps. I am like a tiger; If I
miss the first spring I go growling
back t o N my Jungle. I must take the
fit as it offers. Composition comes over
me in a kind of frenzy, and if I don't
write to empty my mind I go mad.
Poetry is the lava of the imagination,
whose eruption prevents an earth
quake. Much the little envious knot
of parson-poets who rule the reviews
know about it!" he continued half
satirically.
Hobhouse smiled quizzically. The
man beside Him had had a short and
sharp acquaintance with England's
self-constituted authorities in poetic
criticism. Two years before, fresh
from college, he had published a slen
der volume of verses. In quality these
had been indifferent enough, but the
fact that their author was a peer of
fered an attractive text for the gibes
of the reviewers. Their ridicule pierced
him. His answer had been immediate
and stunning â a poetical satire, keen
as a rapier, polished as a mirror, piti
less as the inquisition, which flayed
his detractors one by one for the
'laughter of London. The book had
been the talk of the year, but while
at the very acme of popularity, the
youthful author had withdrawn it, and,
still smarting from the sneers which
had been its inspiration, had sailed for
the Levant. A thought of this sen
sitiveness was in Hobhouse's mind as
Gordon continued:
"When I get home I'll decide whether
to put it into the fire or to publish. If
it doesn't make fuel for me It will for
the critics."
"You gave them cause enough.
You'll admit that."
"Thoy should have let me alone,"
Gordon's voice under its lightness hid
a note of unaffected feeling, and his
eye gathered spots of fire and brown.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
HALLIE ERMINIE RIVES
"It wasn't muchâ that first poor little
college book of mine! But no! I was a
noble upstart â a young fool of a peer
that needed taking down! So they
loosed their literary mountebanks to
snap at me! Is it any wonder I hit
back? Who wouldn't?"
"At least," averred Hobhouse, "very
few would have done it so well. There
was no quill-whittler left in the Brit
ish Isles when you finished that Satire
of yours. None of the precious penny
a-liners will ever forgive you."
The other laughed. "I was mad, I
tell you â mad!" he said with humorous
ferocity. "I wrote in a passion and a
sirocco, with three bottles of claret in
my head and tears in my eyes. Be
sides, I was two years younger then.
Before I sailed I suppressed it. I
bought up the plates and every loose
volume In London. Ah, well," he add
ed, "one's youthful * indiscretions will
pass. When I come back, I'll give the
rascals something better."
He paused, his eyes on the stony
bridle-path that led from the town.
"What do you make of that?" he
queried.
Hobhouse looked. Along the rugged
way was approaching a strange pro
cession. In advance walked an officer
In a purple coat, carrying the long
wand of his rank. Following came a
file of Turkish soldiers. Then a group
of servants, wearing the uniform of
the Waywode â the town's chief magis
trate â and leading an ass, across whose
withers was strapped a bulky brown
sack. After flocked a rabble of all
degrees, Turks and Greeks.
"Queer!" speculated Hobhouse. 'It's
neither a funeral nor a wedding. What
other of their hanged ceremonials can
It be?"
The procession halted on the rock
shelf over the deep pool. The soldiers
began to unstrap the ass* brown bur
den. A quick flash of horrified in
credulity had darted Into Gordon's
eyes. The ass balked, and one of the
men pounded It with his sword-scab
bard. While It flinched and scrambled,
a miserable muffled wail came from
somewhere â seemingly from the air.
Gordon stiffened. His hand flew to
the pistol in his belt. He leaped to his
feet and dashed up the scraggy path
toward the rock, shouting in a voice
of strained, infuriate energy:
"By God, Hobhouse, there's a woman
in that sack!"
CHAPTER H.
"Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know."
At Lady Jersey's town house, in
Portman Square, the final course had
been served and the gentlemen's glasses
were being replenished. Lady Jersey
gave the signal. The gentlemen rose
and bowed, the three ladles withdrew
to the drawing-room; then the host,
the Earl, said, cracking a walnut:
"I heard the other day that George
Oordcm is on his way back to London.
Tou were with him in the East same
time, weren't you, Hobhouse?"
There were but three besides the
host: Sheridan, the playwright, looking
the beau and wit combined, of a clar
ety, elderly, rdd complexion, brisk and
bulbousâ William Lamb, heir of the
Melbourne title, a personified "career"
whose voice was worn on the edges by
public speakingâ and Hobhouse, whom
the Earl addressed.
The young man bowed. "I left him
in Greece Just a year ago."
"Is it true," asked Lamb, sipping
his Moet with finical deliberation,
"that he drinks nothing but barley
water and dines on two soda bis
cuits?"
"He eats very little," assented Hob
house; "dry toast, watercress, a glass
of claret â that was usually his regi
men."
"What an infernal pose!" Lamb ex
claimed, housing. "A ghoul eating
rice with a needle! He does It to be
eccentric. Why, at Cambridge they
say he used to keep a tame bear! His
appetite is all apiece with his other
fopperies abroad that the paper re
print here. One week he's mopish.
Another, he's a sort of limping Don
Quixote, rowing with the police for
a woman of the town â like that
Greek demirep of his he rescued from
the sack, that Petersham tells about."
"Nobody believes Petersham's
yarns," growled Sheridan.
"I was on the ground when that in
cident occurred. I'm sorry the clubs
got hold of it. It's a confounded
shame."
Hobhouse spoke explosively. Lord
Jersey's shrewd, deep-set eyes gath
ered interest and Sheridan paused
with a pinch of snuff in transit.
"It happened one sunrise, when we
were camped on the sea beach Just
outside Missolonghi. That is a Greek
town held by the Turks, who keep its
Christian citizens in terror of their
lives. The girl In the case was a
Greek by birth, but her father was a
renegado, so she came under Moslem
law."
"I. presume she was handsome,"
drawled Lamb caustically. "I credit
Gordon with good taste in femininity,
at least."
Hobhouse flushed, but kept his
temper.
"It's nonsense," he went on â "the
story that it was any affair of his own.
There was a young Arab-looking
ensign who had fallen in with us,
named Trevanlon â he had deserted
from an English sloop-of-the-line at
Bombay. He had disappeared the
night before and we had concluded
then it was for some petticoat deviltry
he'd been into. I didn't like the fellow
from the start, but Gordon wouldn't
give an unlucky footpad the cold
shoulder."
Sheridan chuckled. "That's Gor
don! I remember he had an old hag
of a fire-lighter at his room* here â
Mrs. Muhl. I asked him once why he
ever brought her from Newstead.
â¢Well,' he says, 'no one else will have
the Door old devil.' "
"Come, come." put In Lamb, wasp
lshly. "Let's hear the new version;
we've had Petersham's."
"We had aeen Trevanlon talking to
the girl," Hobhouse continued, "in
her father's shop In the baxaar. We
didn't know, of course, when we saw
the procession, whom the Turkish
scoundrels were going to drown. I
didn't even guess what it was all about
till Gordon shouted to me. His pistol
was out before you could wink, and
In another minute he had ths fat
leader by the throat"
"With Mr. Hobhouse clow behind
him," suggested the Ear!.
"I hadn't a firearm, so I was of small
assistance. .We had some Suliote raga
muffins for a bodyguard, but they axe
so cowed they will run from a Turkish
uniform. They promptly disappeared â
till it was all over. Well, there was a
terrible hullabaloo for a while. I made
sure they would butcher us out and
out, but Gordon kept his pistol clappea
on the purple coat and faced the whole
lot down."
'Wish he had shot him." rumbled
Sheridan, "and appealed to the resi
dent! In the year of Grace 1810 it's
time England took a hand and blew
th^ 1 Turk out of Greece, anyway!"
"I presume there was no doubt about
the offense?" asked the Earl.
"It seemed not Trevanion was a
good-looking, swarthy rogue, and had
been too bold. Though he got away
himself, he left the girl to her fate. It
was the feast of Ramazan. and he
must have known what that fate would
be. The time made interference harder
for Gordon, since both law and religion
were against him. He had learned
seme of their palaver. He told them
he was a pasha-of-three-tails himself
in his own country, and at last made
the head butcher cut open the sack.
The girl was a pitiful thing to see.
v.ith great almond eyes sunk with
fright â fifteen years old, perhaps,
though she looked no more than twelve
â and her chalk-white cheeks and the
nasty way they had her hands and
feet tied made my blood boil. There
was more talk, and Gordon flourished
th^ nrman All Pasha had given him
when we were in Albania. The officer
couldn't read, but he pretended he
could and at last agreed to go back
and submit the matter to the Way
wode. So back we all paraded to Mis
solonghi. It cost Gordon a plenty
there, but he won his point."
"That's where Petersham's account
ends, isn't it?" The Earl's tone was
dry.
"It's not all of it," Hobhouse answer
ed with some heat. "Gordon was afraid
the rascally primate might repent of
his promise (the Mussulman religion is
strenuous) so he took the girl that
day to a convent and as soon
as possible sent her to Argos to her
brother. She died, poor creature, two
months afterward, of fever."
- Lamb sniffed audibly.
"Very pretty! He ought to turn It

wouldn't have been altered. Pshaw!

Bay, 'Poor Gordonâ how Interesting he
looks! 1 Everything he does is a hectic
of vanity, and all he has written is
glittering nonsense â show and sophis
try."
Sheridan's magnificent iron-gray
bead, roughly hacked as if from gran
ite, turned sharply. "He's no sheer
seraph nor saint." he retorted; "none of
us Is, but curse catch me! there's no
sense In remonstering him! He'll do
great things one of these days. He was
born with a rosebud in his mouth and
a nightingale singing in his ear!"
The other shrugged his shoulders, but
at that moment the protestant face of
the hostess appeared.
"How interesting men are to each
other'" Lady Jersey exclaimed. "We
women have actually been driven to
the evening papers."
The four men followed Into the draw
lng-rooza. furnished in ruby and dull
s;old â a room perfect in its appoint
ments, for its mistress added to her
innate kindness of heart and tact %
rare taste and selection. It showed in
the Sevres-topped tables, the tawny
firescreens, the candelabra of Jasper
and filigree gold, and in the splendid
Gainsborough opposite the door.
The whole effect was a perfect set
ting for Lady Jersey. In It Lady Caro
line Lamb appeared too exotic, too
highly colored, too flamboyantâ like a
purple orchid In a dish of tea-roses:
on the other hand It was too warmly
drawn for the absent statellness of An
nabel Milbanke. Lady Melbourne's
niece and guest for the season. The
tatter's very posture, coldly fair like a
sword on salute, seemed to chide the
sparkle and glitter and color that ra
'-diated. a latent impetuosity, from
Lady Caroline.
"I see by the Courier," observed La-iy
Jersey, "that George Gordon Is la
London."
"Speak of the devilâ" sneered Lamb;
and Sheridan said:
"That's curious; we were just dis
cussing him."
Miss Milbanke's even votee entered
the conversation. "One hears every
where of his famous Satire. Tou think,
well of it don't you, Mr. Sheridan?"
"My dear madam, for the honor ot
having written it. I would have wel
comed all the enemies it has made its
author."
"What dreadful things the papers
are always saying about him!" cried
Lady Jersey, with a little shudder. "I
hope his mother hasn't seen them. I
hear she lives almost a recluse at New
stead Abbey."
"With due respect to the conven
tions." Lamb interposed Ironically,
"there's small love lost between them.
His guardian used to say they quar
reled like cat and dog."
"He never liked the boy." dispoted
the hostess, warmly. ""Why. he
wouldn't stand with him when he took
his seat In the Lords. I am right, am
I not, Mr. Hobhouse r*
"Yea, your ladyship. Lord Carlisle
refused to introduce him. The Chan
cellor, even, haggled absurdly over his
certificate of birth. Gordon came to
Parliament with only one friend â an
old tutor of hisâ entered alone, took
the peer's oath and left. He has never
crossed the threshold since."
"What a shame," cried Lady Caro
line, "that neither Annabel nor I have
ever seen your paragon. Lady Jersey!
Mr. Hobhouse, you or Mr. Sheridan
must bring him to dinner to Melbourne
House."
"If he'll come!" said Lamb, sotto
voce. to the Earl. "They say he hates
to see women tat, because it destroys
his illusions."
Lady Jersey shrugged. "It Is vastly
in his favor that he still has any." she
retorted, rising. "Come, Caro, give us
some music. We are growing too seri
ous."
Lady Caroline went to the piano and
let her hands wander over the keys.
Wild, Impatient of restraint, she was a
perpetual kaleidoscope of changes.
Now an unaccountably serious mood
had caDtured her. The melody that
fell from her fingers was a minor
strain, and she began singing in a
voice low. soft and caressingâ with a
feeling that Annabel Milbanke had
never guessed lay within that agree
able, absurd, perplexing, mad-cap lit
tle being:
Maid of Athens, ere wÂ» part.
Gire. oh. (It* me back my eartt

She sang the lines with a strange
tenderness â a haunting; accent of re
frain that had insensibly moved every
one In the room and surprised for a mo
ment even her own matter-of-fact hus
band. A womanly softness had misted
Lady Jersey's gaze and Annabel Mll
banke looked quickly and curiously up
at the singer as she paused, a spot ot
color in her cheeks and her hazel eyes
large and bright.
There was a moment of sflenoo â >
blank which Hobhouse broke:
"He wrote that when we wert trav
ellng together m Albania. I'm glad t
sent It to you. Lady Carol in*. I didn't
know how beautiful It was."
Miss Milbanke turned her head.
"So that Is George Gordon's." she
said. She had felt a slight thrill, aa
emotion new to her, while the other
sang. "Mr. Hobhouse, what does he
look like?"
The young man. who was by nature
and liking something of an artist, took
a folded paper from his wallet and
spread It out beneath a lamp.
"I made this sketch the last night X
saw him in Greece," he said, "at Mis
solonghi. Just a year ago."
Lady Caroline Lamb and Miss Mil
banke both bent to look at the por
fait. .When they withdrew their eyse
th* calmer, colder features showed
nothing, but Lady Caroline's wore a
deep, vivid flush.
'Mad, bad and dangerous to know!"
her brain was saying, "yet â what a
face:"
CHAPTER IH.
The Boomerang.
"George Gordon!"
There was an unaffected pleasure ta
the exclamation, and its echo tn the
answer. "Sherry! And young as ever,
XV be bound!"
"I heard last night at Lady Jersey's
you were In London." said Sheridan,
after the first greetings. "So you've
had enough of Greece, eh? Three
years! What have you done in ail
that time?"
"I have dined the mufti of Thebes.
I have viewed the harem of All Pasha.
I have kicked an Athenian postmaster.
I was blown ashore on the island of
S&lamis. I caught a fever going to
Olympia. And I have found that I
like to be back in England â the oddest
thing of all! "
Gordon ended half earnestly. Tread
ing the familiar thoroughfares, tasting
the city's rush, its interminableness, Its
counterplay and torsion of living, he
had felt a sense of new appreciation.
His months of freer breathing In the
open spaces of the East had quickened
klr. pulses.
The pair strolled on together chat
ting the old wit linking hie arm In the
younger man's. He had always liked
Gordon and the appearance of his fame us. tour de force had lifted this lik
ing into genuine admiration.
"Hohhouse says you've brought back
another book," said he, presently.
"I've- a portmanteau crammed with
stanzas m Spenser's measure, but
they're likely to be driveling idlotlsm
1 must leave that to the critics. I
have heard their chorus of deep dam
nations once," Gordon added ruefully.
â¢ But no doubt they've long ago for
. jrotten ray infantile â¢ ferocities."
Sheridan shot a keen glance under
his bushy brows Could the other, he
wondered, have so undervalued the
vicious hatred his cutting Satire had
raised in the ranks of the prigs and
pamphleteers it pilloried? In hie long
foreign absence had he been Ignorant
of the flood of tales so assiduously
circulated in the, London newspapers
and magazines? . . â  '
His thought snapped. Gordon had
halted before a bookshop which bore
the slgm of "The Juvenile Library,"
â¢ his eye caught by printed words on a
pasteboard placard hung in its win
dow.
"Sherry!" he cried, his color chang
ing prlsmatlcally. "Look there!"
â¢ The sign read:
"Queen Slab."

expense) which can be bought nowhere

"Devil take the blackguard!" blurted
Sheridan. He followed the other into
the musty shop, where a stooped,
agate-eyed old man laid aside a black
letter volume of Livv's Roman His
tory and shuffled forward to greet
them.
Gordon's face was pallid and his eye*
were sparkling. He had written the
book the pasteboard advertised in a
nt of rare that had been, cooled to
shame of its retaliative scorn. He had
believed every copy procurable de
*stroyed before he left England. He had
thought of this fact often with self
ccngratulation, dreaming this monu
ment of his youthful petulance rooted
out. To-day it was almost the first
thing he confronted. The sedulous
greed that hawked his literary indis
cretion to the world roused now an
old murderous fury that had some
times half-scared him in his child
hood. He was battling with this as he
pointed out the second item of the
sign.
"How many of these have you?" he
asked the proprietor shortly.
"Twelve."
"I will take them all " Gordon put a
bank-note on the counter.
The bookseller regarded him sagely
as he set the books before him. It
was a good day's bargain.
A doorway led from the shop into a
binding-room, where stood a stove
with glue pots heating upon It. With
a word to Sheridan, Gordon seized his
purchase and led the way Into this
room. The dealer stared and fol
lowed.
He saw the purchaser tear the
books cover from cover, and thrust
them one by one into the fiery maw
of the stove. And now, at the
stranger's halting step and the beauty
of his face, sudden intelligence came
to him. ,Five â â twenty guineas
apiece he could have got, If he had
only found the wit to guess! The
knowledge turned his parchment vis
ng-e saffron with suppressed cupidity,
anger -and regret.
The bell in the outer room an
nounced a customer, and the book
seiler went into the shop, leaving the
â  door ajar. Through it came a voice â
a lady's inquiry. She was asking for
a copy of the Satire whose pages were
.-â¢â¢ling under Sheridan's regretful
eye.
â¢ Gordon's hand held the last vol
ume. He had turned to look through
the door â a tine, tall, spirited-looking
cjrl. he thought. His observant eye
noted her face â a cool, chaste classic.
raid her dress, rich, but with a kind of
quiet and severity.
Yielding: to some whimsical im
pulse, he went rapidly out to the pave
ment. She was seating herself in her
< ;irriag~ beside her companion as he
approached.
"I had juFt secured the last copy,"
he stated gravely, almost apologetic
ally. "I have another, however, and
shall be glad if you will take this."
A glimmer of surprise had
shadowed the immobile face, but it
passed.
You are very kind," she said. "It
seems difficult to procure. We saw
tfle sign quite by accident!" She was
demurring â prudential grounds.
She hesitated only a moment â
long enough for him to become aware
of another personality beside her, an
impression of something wild, Ariel
like, eccentric yet pleasing then she
searched he: purse and held out to
\ him a golden guinea.
"That is the price, I think.," she
added, and with the word â¢'Melbourne
House" to the coachman, the carriage
merged in the. stream of the highway.
Annabel Milbanke's complaisant
brow was undisturbed. She was very
self-possessed, very unromantic, very
correct. As the chestnut bays whirled
on toward Hyde Park corner, she did
no more .-â¢! allow her .colorless
imagination to ask herself: "Who is
he, 1 wonder?"
Her fragile, overdressed companion
might have answered that mental
tinestiop. Am Gordon had come from
the doorway, his step halting, yet so
slightly as to be unnoticed by one
xv ho saw the delicate symmetry/ of his
fate, a quick tinge had come to Lady
Caroline Lamb's cheeks. The brown
curie j)il<Â»d Â°n the pale oval of brow,
the d<-^p gray eyes, the full chiseled
lips end strongly modeled chin â
brought hack to her a pencil sketch
she had once eeen under a table lamp.
The ting.? grew swiftly on, but she
eaid nothing. ,
Gordon had seen neither the flush
nor the backward look. . HiÂ» eyes, as
he surveyed the golden guinea in his
hand, held only the picture of the calm
girl who had given it to him.
"Melbourne House," he repeated
aloud. "What a stately beauty she has
â the perfection of a glacier! , I wonder
c*uv why 1 did that," he thought quiz
zically. "1 never saw her before. A
e-mail who wants to read my Satire; 1
and 1 always hated an esprit in petti
toats! It was impulse â pure impulse,
reasonless and irresponsible. , God
knows what contradictions one con
tains!"
He tossed the coin in the air ab
etractediy, caught it and' slipped it into
his waistcoat pocket as Sheridan re
joined him. - The latter had not seen
the carriage and its occupants. â¢ '
"A fine ash heap we've made," said
the wit. "and a pity, too! Curse catch
me, I wish; I'd written it! If it were
mine, instead of suppressing. I'd print
a new edition. and be damned to them.
If they won't forget this cram an

of iin de Graves with me at the Cocoa-

go to the Italian opera afterward.
What i do you say?"
Gordon shook his head. "Not to-day.

Hobhouse pretends he wants to read
my new manuscript" : ; _ , :'. ;
"To-morrow then. I want to ret the
rights* of the latest apocryphal stories

"Stories? . What stories?" . s
Sheridan cleared hie . throat' uneasily.
"Surely letters â newspapers â - must
have reached you in Greece?"
"Newspapers!" exclaimed Gordon.
"I haven't read one in a year. As for
lettersâ well, it has been little better.
Bo the newspapers have been talking
of me, eh?"
"Not that any one in particular be
lieves them," interposed his compan
ion hastily, "or anything the Scourge
prints for that matter!"
"The Scourge? That was the worst
of the lot before I left. It's still mud
flinging, i 6 it? I suppose I might have
expected it. There's scarcely a witling
ecribbler In London I didn't grill with
that cursed Satire of mine, thas. they
won't let stay in its grave. But the
newspaper wiseacres â what under the
canopy can they know of my wander
ings? I haven't set eyes on a jour
nalist since I left."
"Of course, they're perfectly irre
sponsible! "
"What are they saying, Sherry?"
Sheridan hesitated.
"Come, come; out with It!"
"The Morning Post reported last
week that the Pasha of the Morea had
made you a present of a Circassian
girl-"
"It was a Circassian mare!"
"And that you had quarters in a
Franciscan nunnery."
"A monastery!" Gordon laughedâ
an umnirthful laugh. "With one Ca
puchin friar, a bandy-legged Turkish
cook, a coude of Albanian savages
and a dragoman! What tales are they
telling at the clubs?"
"That's about all that's new â except
Petersham. He has some tale of a
Turkish perl of yours that you saved
from a sack in the Aegean."
Gordon's lips set tight together. The
pleasure he had feit at his return had
been shot through with a new pain
that spoke plainly in his question:
".Sherry! Is there no story they
tell of these two years that I need not
blush ;;t '.'"
The other caught at the straw.
"They say you swam the Hellespont
and outdid Leander."
"I'm obliged to them! I wonder they
didn't invent a Hero to wait for my
Leanderin?'" The voice held a bitter
humor, the antithesis of the open
pleasantry of iheir meeting. "I pre
*<un;e that version will not be long in
arriving," Gordon added, and held out
his hand.
Sheridan grasped it warmly. "I shall
t=ee you to-omorrow," he said, and they
parted.
From the edge of his show-window,
William Godwin, the bookseller, with a
malignant look in hla agate eyes,
watched Gordon go.
In the inner room he raked the frag
ments of charred leather from the
stove, thinking of the guineas he had
let slip through his fingers. Then he
sat down at his desk and drawing
some dusty sheets of folio to him began
to write, with many amendations. His
quill pen scratched maliciously for a
long time. At last he leaned back and
regarded what he had written with
huge satisfaction.
"The atheistical brat of a lord!" he
muttered vindictively. "I'll make his
ribs gridirons for his heart! I'll send
this as a leader for the next issue of
the Scourge!"
CHAPTER IV.
The Little Boy in Aberdeen.
"It is magnificent!" Hobhouse look
ed up as he spoke.
It was In Gordon's apartment In Red
dish's Hotel. The table was strewn
with loose manuscript â the verses he
had laughingly told Sheridan were
"likely to be driveling idiotism." Over
these Hobhouse had bent for an hour,
absorbed and delighted, breathing their
strange spirit of exhilaration, of free
dom from rhythmic shackles, of ad
venture into untried poetic depths.
They 6tood out m sharp relicf â original,
unique, of classic model yet of a genre
all their own. It would be a facer for
Jeffrey, the caustic editor of the Ed
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL*
lnburgh Review, and for all the crab
apple following Gordon's boyish ran
cor had roused to abuse. Now he said:
"Nothing like it was ever written be
fore. Have you shown it to a pub
lisher yet?"
Gordon glanced at the third person
in the roomâ a gray-haired elderly man
with kindly eyesâ as he replied:
"Dallas, here, took it to Miller. He
declined It"
"The devil!" shot out Hobhouse, In
credulously.
"John Murray will publish it," Gor
don continued. "I had his letter with
the copyhold an hour ago." He took
a paper from his pocket and held it up
to view.
"I congratulate you both," Hobhouse
said heartily.
Gordon shrugged acridly, and rising,
began to pace the room. The sore
spot had been rankling since that walk
with Sheridan."
"Walt till the critics see it. They
will have other opinions no doubt.
Well, never mind," he added. "I was
peppered so highly once that it must
be aloes or cayenne to make me taste.
They forced me to bitterness at first;
I may as well go through to the last.
Vac victis! I'll fall fighting the host.
That's something."
The gray-haired man had picked up
his hat. It was not a hat of the prim
est curve, nor were his clothes of a
fashionable cut. They were well-worn,
but his neckcloth was spotless and
though his face, showed lines of toil
and anxiety It bore the inextinguish
able marks of gentility. Gordon had
not told him that he had spent a part
of the day Inquiring; Into the last de
tail of invalid wife and literary fail
ure; now his glance veiled a singular
look whose source lay very deep in the
man.
"Don't hasten," he said. "I have a
reputation for gloom, but my friends
must not be among the reputants!
Least of all you, Dallas."
The other sat down again and threw
his hat on the table, smiling. "Gloom?"
he asked. "And have you still that
name? You were so as a little laddie
in Aberdeen, but I thought you would
have left off the Scotch blues long ago
with your tartan."
"I wish I could," cried Gordon, "as
I left off the burr from my tongue.
How I hated tha placeâ all except Dee
side and old Lachin-y-gair! That
pleased me for its wildness. If God
had a hand in its valleys the devil
must have had a hoof in some of Its
ravines, for the clouds foamed up from
their crevices like the spray of the
ocean of hell. Dallas," he said, veer
ing, "what a violent, unlovely little
wretch it was we used to know so
many years agoâ you never saw him,
Hobhouse!â that little boy in Aber
deen!"
Hobhouse looked up. There was. a
curious note in the voice, a sort of
brooding inquiry, of regret, of wist
fulness all in one. It was a tone he
had never heard so plainly but once
beforeâ a night when they two had
eat together before a campflre on the
Greek seacoast, when Gordon had
talked of old Cambridge days and of
Matthews, his classmate, destined to
be drowned. It was this tone Hob
house heard.
The older man's eyes had a retro
spective haze, which he winked away
as he smoothed down the frayed edges
of his waistcoat with a hesitating hand,
as though half-embarrassed under the
other's gaze.
"A little misshapen unit of a mil
lion," continued Gordon, "a miserable
nothing of something, who dreamed
barbarous fantasies and found no one
who understood him â no one but one.
Do you remember him, Dallas?"
The other nodded, his head turned
away. "He -was not bo bard to un
derstand."
"Not for you, Dallas, and it's for that
reason most of all I am going to paint
his picture. Will it bore you, Hob
house?" he asked whimsically. "To
discuss childhood is such a sniveling,
popping smallshot, water-hen waste of
powder to most people."
Hobhouse shook his head and the
speaker went on:
"First of all, I wish you would wit
ness a signature for me" â and handed
him the paper he had taken from his
pocket.
As the young man glanced at it, he
looked un with quick surprise, but
checked himself and. sismlnsr it, leaned
back in his chair.
Gordon returned to his Blow pic*
up and down the room, and as he went
he talked:
"The fiercest animals have thÂ«
smallest litters, and he was" an only
child, though he had been told he had
a half-sister somewhere in the world.
He was unmanageable in temper, bul
lenly passionate, a queer little bundle
of silent rages and wants and hates â
the sort people call 'inhuman.' There
was never but one nurse, if I remem
ber, who could manage him at all. He
had r twisted footâ the gift of his
mother, and added to by a Nottingham
quack. He lived In lodgings â cursed
fusty they were, too, the fustiest in
Aberdeen â with his mother. He had
never set eyes on his father; how he
knew he had one. I can't imagine.
When he was old enough, he was sent
to 'squeel,' as they called It in Aber
deen dialect â day school, where he
learned to say:
'God â made â man.
vv e tt â us â love â Him,'
and to make as poor a scrawl as ever
scratched over a frank. He was a
blockhead, a hopeless blockhead!
The master â how devout and raaor
faced and dapper he was! he was
minister to the kirk also â used to
topsy-turvy the class now and then,
and bring the lowest highest. These
were the only times the boy was at
the head. Then the master would say.
*Now, George, man, let's see how soon
you can limp to the foot again!' This
was a Jest, but when the others
shouted the boy used to turn cold
with shame. Small wonder he didn't
learn, for he didn't want to. A pity,
too, Dallas, for in those days three
words and a half-mile would have
changed him. I venture it would take
more than that to-day!"
He paused, his brows frowning, his
lips drawn softly. When he went on,
it v/as in a more constrained tone:
"One year, suddenly, everything
changed. His guardian took him from
the school and he had a tutor â a very
serious saturnine young man, with
spectacles" â Dallas had taken off his
own and was polishing them earnestly
with his handkerchief â "who didn't
make the boy hate him â a curious
thins! He was a great man already
In the boy's eyes, because he had been
in America when the colonies were
fighting King George. The boy would
have liked to be a colonist, too â he
had never been Introduced to the
gaudy charlatanry of kings and the
powwowishness of rank. He hadn't
become a lord then, himself.
â  "This marvel of a tutor wasn't pesti
lentiy prolix. He taught him no
skimble-skamble out of the catechism,
though he was a good churchman;
the first time the boy looked in those
big horn spectacles, he knew there
was one man in the world who could
understand him. The tutor made him
want to learn, too. and strangest of
all, he never seemed to notice that his
pupil was lame. How did he perform
that miracle. Dallas?"
The older man set his glasses care
fully on the ridge of his nose, as he
shook his head with a little graceful,
deprecating gesture that was very
winning. Hobhouse's eyes were trac
ing the design of the carpet.
"I remember once," Gordon contin
ued, "a strange thing happened. The
boy's father came to Aberdeen. One
dayâ the boy was walking up the High
street with his tutorâ some one pointed
him out. To think that splendid-look
ing man in uniform was his father! He
felt very pitiful-hearted, but he pluck
ed up courage and went up to him and
told his name."
Dallas, who had shifted uneasily in
his chair, cleared his throat with some
energy, rose and stood looking out of
the window.
"The splendid gentleman forgot to
take the boy in his arms. He looked
him over and lisped: "A pretty boyâ
but what a pity he has such a leg!' A
queer thing to say, wasn't It, Hob
houee!
"One of those fits of r&^e that made
all right-minded people hate him came
over the boy when he heard that.
'Dlnna speak of it! Dinna speak of it!*
he screamed, and struck at the man
with his fist. Then he ran away â off
to the fields, I thinkâ as fast as he
could, and that was the first and last
time he ever saw his father.
"He had forgotten all about his tu
tor, but the tutor ran after him, and
found him, and took him for a wonder
ful afternoonâ miles away, clear to the
seaside, where they lay on the purple
heather and he read to him out of the
historyâ what was it he read to the
boy, Dallas?" .
The man bjÂ» the window Jumped.
"Bless my soul," he said, wiping his
eyes vigorously ; "I do believe It was
the battle of Lake Regillus!"
"Yes, it was, Dallas! And they went
in swimming and had supper at a
farmhouse â " _Â,,,,
"So they did! So I believe they did!
"And they didn't get home till the
moon was up. Ahâ Dallas!"
Gordon went over and laid his nana
on the other's arm. "Do you think I
shall ever forget?" he said.
"I Imagine that was the end of the
tutorship," observed Hobhouse.
"Yes, the Idiots!" Gordon laughed a
llttlo, as did the elder man. though
there was a suspicious moisture in the
letter's eyes. "They said he was spoil
ing me. You came to London, Dallas,
end wrote booksâ moral essays and
theologyâ too good to give you money
or fame. Yes, yes"â as Dallas made a
gesture of dissentâ "much too good for
this thaw-swamped age of rickety trag
edy and canting satire! But when you
left Aberdeen you left something be
hind. It was a ponyâ four sound
straight legs, Dallas, to help out a
crooked one â a fat, frowsy, hard-going
little beast, I*ve no doubt, but It seem
ed the greatest thing- in all Scotland to
me."
â¢â¢Pshawl" protested Dallas. "It laid
me only four pounds, I'll swear."
"Well," pursued Gordon, "the boy
finally dropped back into the old stub
born rut. He went to Harrow and
came out a solitary, and to Cambridge
and they called him an atheist. Life
hasn't been all mirth and innocence,
milk and water. I've seen nearly as
many lives as Plutarch's, but I'm not
bilious enough to forget. Dallas. You
were the first of all to write and con
gratulate me when the critics only
sneered. When I came to London
to claim my seat in the Lords (a
scurvy honor, but one has to do as
other people do, confound them!) with
out a single associate in that body to
Introduce meâ l think a peer never
came to his place so unfriendlyâ you
rode with me to the door, Dallas, you
and I alone, and so we rode back
again."
He paused, took up the paper Hob
house had signed and handed it to the
man who still stood by the window.
"Dallas," he said, "you gave me my
first ride in the saddle. I've been
astride another bigger nag lately â one
they call Pegasus; this is its flrst real
gallop, and I want you to ride with
me."
With a puzzled face Dallas looked
from the speaker to the paper. It was
Gordon's copyhold of the verses that
lay there in manuscript, legally trans
ferred to himself.
As he took in its significance, a deep
flush stole into his scholarly-palo
cheeks, and tears, unconcealed this
time, clouded his sight. He put out
one uncertain hand, while Hobhouse
made a noisy pretense of gathering to
gether the loose leaves under his
hands.
"It's for six hundred pounds!" he
eaid huskily; "six hundred pounds!"
CHAPTER V.
An Anythingarian.
Two hours later Gordon sat alone in
the room, looking out on the soften
ing sun-glare of St. James street. In
the chastened light the brilliant dark
auburn curls that clustered over his
colorless face showed a richer brown
and under their long black lashes his
eyes had deepened their tint. Near-by,
whenÂ» Park Place opened, a fountain
played, on whose bronze rim dusty
sparrows preened and twined. The
clubs that faced the street were show-
Ing signs of life, and on the pave a
newsboy, for the benefit of late-rising
west-e*ad dandles, was crying the pa
pers.
Gordon was waiting for Hobhouse.
They were to sup together this last
night. To-morrow he was to leave for
Newstead Abbey and the uncomfort
able ministrations of his eccentric and
capricious mother, whom he had not
yet seen. He had come back to his
land and place to find that enmity
had been busy envenoming his absence,
and the taste of home had turned un
sweet to his palate.
As he sat now, however. Gordon
had thrust bitterness from his
mood. He was thinking with satisfac
tion of the copyhold he had
transferred. He had always de
clared that for what he wrote he
would take no money. If these verses
â the first, in whi~h he felt he had ex
pressed something of his real self â if
these brought recompense, it was a
fitting dispositilon he had made. He
had paid an old debt to the man with
the worn waistcoat and kindly, studi
ous face â almost the only debt of its
kind he owed in the world.
The words with which Dallas had
left him recurred to him â "God bless
you!"
"Poor, old plodding Dallas!" he
mused reflectively. "It's curious how
a man's sense of gratitude drags up
his religion â if he has any to drag up.
He thinks now the Creator put it into
my heart to da that â doesn't give him
self a bit of credit for it!"
He laughed reminiscently.
"I don't suppose he has seen Â£600
to spend since he bought that pony!
He has had a hard row to hoe all his
life, and never did an ounce of harm
to any living thine, yet at the flrst turn
of good luck he fairly oozes thankful
ness to the Almighty. He is a church
man clear through. He believes in re
vealed religion â though no religion
ever is revealed â and yet he doesn't
mistake theology for Christianity. He
positively doesn't know the meaning
of the word cant. Ahâ there goes an
other type!"
Gordon was looking at a square, mot
tle-faced man passing slowly on the
opposite side of the street, carrying a
bundle of leaflets, from which now and
then he drew to give a passer-by. He
was hlgh-browed, with eyes that pro
jected like an insect's and were flat
tish in their orbits. He wore a min
isterial cloak over his street costume.
"There's Cassidy," he said to him
self. "Dr. James Cassidy, on shore
leave, distributing his little doctrinal
tracts. I remember him well. He is
in the navy medical service, but it's
the grief of his life he can't be a par
son. He talked enough pedantry over
the ship's table of the Pylades, while I
was coming home from Greece, to last
me till the resurrection. He is as
ardent a predestinarian as any Calvin
istlc dean in gaiters and knows all tha
hackneyed catch phrases of eternal
punishment. He has an itch for propa
ganda, and distributes his tracts,
piinted at his own expense, on the
street corners for the glory of theol
ogy. He is the sort of Christian who
always writes damned with a dash.
And yet I wonder how much real true
Christianity he has â Christianity like
Dallas, I mean. I remember that scar
on his cheek; it stands for a thrashing
hf got once at Bombay from a desert
ing ensign named Trevanion â a youth
I met in Greece afterward, and had
cause to remember, by the way!"
His eyes had darkened suddenly.
His brows frowned, his firm white
hand ran over his curls as though to
brush away a disagreeable recollec
tion.
"Cassidy would travel half around
the globe to find the deserter that
thrashed him and land him In quod.
That man would deserve It richly
enough, but would Cassidy's act be fox
the good of the King's service? No â
for the satisfaction of James Cassidy,
Is that Christianity? Dallas never
treasured an enmity in his life. Yet
bcth of them believe the same doc
trine, worship the same God, read the
same Bible. Does man make his be
liefs? Or do his beliefs make him?
If his beliefs make man, why
are Dallas and Cassidy so differ
ent? If man makes his beliefs, why
should I not make my own? I will
be an Anythingarian, and leave dreams
to Emanuel Swedenborg!"
His gaze, that had followed the cler
ical figure till It passed out of sight,
returned meditatively to the slaty
white buildings opposite.
"Some people call me an atheist â I
never could understand why, though I
prefer Confucius to the ten command
ments and Socrates to St. Paulâ the
two latter happen to agree In their
opinion of marriage â and I don't think
eating bread or drinking wine from the
hand of an earthly vicar will make
me an inheritor of heaven. Dallas
would tell me not to reason, but to
believe. You might as well tell a man
not to wake, but to sleep. Neither
Cicero nor the Messiah could ever have
altered the vote of a single lord of the
bed chamber! And then to bully with
torments and all that! The menace of
hell makes as many devils as the penal
code makes villains. All cantâMeth
odistlcal cantâ yet Dallas believes it.
And both he and Cassidy belong to
the same one of the seventy-two sects
that are tearing each other to pieces
for the love of the Lord and hatred
of each other â the sects that call men
atheists because the eternal why will
creep into what they write. If it pleases
the church â I except Dallasâ to damn
me for asking; questions, I shall be
only one with some millions of scoun
drels who, after all, seem as likely ts
be damned as ever. As for Immortal
ity if people are to live, why die? And
our carcases, are they worth raising;?
I hope if mine is I shall have a better
pair of legs than I have moved on
these three-and-twenty years, or I shall
be sadly behind in the squeeM into
paradise!"
There was a knock at the door. He
rose and opened it It was Hobhouse.
Gordon caught up his hat and they left
the hotel together.
As they crossed Park place a woman,
draggled and gin-besotted, strayed
from some Thames-side stews, sat on
the worn stone base of the fountain,
leaning uncertainly against its bronie
rim. Her swollen lids hid her eye*
and one hand, ralm up, was thrown
out across her lap. Gordon drew a
shilling from his pocket, and passing
his arm in Hobhouse's. laid it in the
outstretched hand. At the touch of the
coin the drab started up. looked at him
stupidly an instant, then with a ribald
yell of laughter she flung the shilling;
Into the water and shambled across
the square, mimicking, in a hideous
sort of buffoonery, the lameness of his
gait.
Gordon's face turned ashen. He
walked on without a word, but his
companion could feel his hand tremble
against his sleeve. When he spoke it
was in a voice half-smothered, forbid
ding.
"The old jeer!" he said. "The very
riffraff of the street fling; it at me!
Yet I don't know why they should
spare that taunt; even my mother did
not. "Lame brat!' she called me once
when I was a child." He laughed. Jar
ringly, harshly. "Why, only a few
days before I sailed from England in
one of her fits of passion she flung it
at me. May you be as ill-formed in
mind as you are in body!* Could they
wish me worse than she?"
â¢'Gordon!" expostulated the other.
"Don't!â"
He had no time to finish. A yriazled
man in the dress of an upper serv
ant was approaching them, his
rubicund face bearing an unmistakable
look of haste and concern.
"We!!, Fletcher?" inquired Gordon.
"I thought your lordship had gone
out earlier. I have been inquiring for
you at the clubs. This message has
just come froni Newstead."
Hi 3 master took the letter and read
it. A strange, slow, remorseful look
overspread the passion on hfs face.
"No ill news, I hope," ventured Hob
house.
Gordon made no reply. He crashed
the letter Into his pocket, turned
abruptly and strode up St. James
street.
"His lordship's mother died yester
day. Mr. Hobhouse," said the valet in
a low voice
"Good God!" exclaimed the other.
"What a contretemps."
A knot o* loungers were seated under
the chandeliers in the bow-window of
White's Club as Gordon passed on his
way to the coach. Beau Brummell.
elegant, spendthrift, to white great
coat and blue satin cravat exhaling
an odor of eau de Jasmin, lifted a lan
guid glass to his eye.
"I'll go something handsome'" cried
he; "I thought he was in Greece!"
"He's the young whelp of a peer who
made such a dust with that Satire he
wrote." Lord Petersham informed his
neighbor. "Hero of the sack story I
told you. Took the title from his great
uncle, the madman who killed old
Chaworth in that tavern duel. House
of Lords tried him for murder, you
know. Used to train crickets and club
them over the head with straws; all
of them left the house in a body the
day he died. Devilish queer story.
Who's the aged party with thÂ» port
manteaus? Valet?"
"Yes," asserted some one. "The old
man was here a while ago trying to
find Gordonâ with bad news. His
lordship's mother is dead.
"Saw her once at Newstead Abby,"
yawned Brummell, wearily, dusting his
cuffs. "Corpulent termagant and gave
George no end of a row. He used to
call her his 'maternal war-whoop.' My
own parents â poor good people!â died
long ago," he added reflectively; "âcut
their throats eating peas with a knife."
CHAPTER VI.
What the Dead May Know.
Gordon was alone in the vehicle.
for Fletcher rode outside. He set his
face to the fogged pane, catching tha
panorama of dark hedges, gouged
gravelly runnels and stretches of
murky black, with occasional instan
taneous sense of detailâ dripping;
bank, sodden rhododendron and mil
dewed masonry â vivid in a dull, yel
low, soundless flare of July lightning.
A gauze of unbroken grayness, a
straggling light â the lodge. A battle
mented wall plunging out of the dark
ness â and Gordon saw the Abbey, its
tiers of ivied cloisters uninhabited
since Henry the Eighth battered the
old pile to ruin, its gaunt and un
sightly forts built for some occupant's
whim, and the wavering, fog
wreathed lake reflecting lighted win
dows. This was Newstead in which
the bearers of his title had lived and
died, the gloomy seat of an ancient
house stained by murder and insanity.
of which he was the sole representa
tive.
What was he thinking as he sat in
the gloomy dining-room, with Rushton.
the footman he had trained to his own
service, standing behind his chair? Of
his mother first of all. He had never,
even as a child, distinguished a sl#n of
real tenderness in her moments of
tempestuous caresses. Hia maturer
yenrs had grown to reganl her with a
half scornful, half good-humored tol
erance. He had shrugged at her tem
pers, dubbing her "The Honorable
Kitty** or his "Amiable Alecto." His
letters to her had shown only a nice
sense of filial duty: many of them
began with "Dear Madam'; more had
been signed simply with his name.
Yet now he felt an aching hope that
in her seclusion she had not seen th*
unkindest of stories of him. His half
gister now on her way from the
north of England â absorbed with her
family cares, would have missed thebrunt of the attacks; his mother had
been within their range. He recalled
with a pang that she had treasured
with a degree of pride a single re
view of his earliest book which had
not joined in the sneering chorus.
He pushed back his chair, dismissed
the footman, and alone passed to the
hall and ascended the stair. At the
turn of the balustrade a shaded lamp
drowsed like a monster glow-worm.
in his own room a low fire burned,
winking redly from the coroneted bed
and a lighted candle stood on
he dressing table. He looked around
he familiar apartment a moment un
nly, then crossed to a carved
Let above a writing desk and took
therefrom a bottle of claret. The
cabinet had belonged to his father,
dead many years before. Gordon
thought of him a* he stood wjth the
bottle in his hand, staring fixedly at
the dull, carved ebony of the swing
â  Â«or.
His father! "Mad Jack Gordon"
the world had called him when he ran
away with the Marchioness of Car
marthen to break her heart! Hand
some he h*d been still when he mar
ried for her money the heiress of
Gight, Gordon's mother. A stinging
memory recalled the only glimpse he
had ever had of that fatherâ a tall
man in uniform on an Aberdeen street,
looking critically at a child with a
lame leg.
Gordon winced painfully. He felt
with a sharper agony the sensitive
pang of the cripple, the shame of mis-
Hhapencess that all his life had clung
like an old-man-of-the sea. It had
not only stung his childhood; it had
stolen from him the romance of his
youthâ the one gleam that six years
a.go had died.
Six years! For a moment time fell
away like rotten shale from about a
crystal. The room, the wine cabinet,
faded into a dim background, and on
ihis, as if on a theater curtain, dis
solving pictures painted themselves
flame-like.
He was back in "his Harrow days now.
at home for bis last vacation.
"George," his mother had remarked
one day, looking up from a letter she
â vac reading. "I've some news for you.
Take out your handkerchief, for you
will need it."
"Nonsense! What Is it?"
" Mary Chaworth is married."
"Is that all?" he had replied coldly;
but an expression, peculiar, impossible
to describe, had passed over his face.
He had never afterward seen her or
spoken her name.
'Mary:' he murmured, and his hand
set down the bottle on the table. Love
-such love as his verseÃ told of â he,
had come to consider purely subjective,
;Â± miriige. a simulacrum to which ac
tual lite possessed no counterpart. Yet
U moment he was feeling the
ftrmith of an old thrill, his nostrils
smelting a rerfume like a dead pansy's
ghost.
He withdrew his hand from the bot-
Bd his fingers clenched. How it
hurt him â ihe sudden stab! For mem
ory had played him a trick; it had
-d a voice out of the past. It
ias her voice â her words that she had
..ttertd in a careless sentence meant
I ber ears, urn that through those
ars had tumbled and re-echoed in
unJ^r sea-cavern of his mmd â
;ou think I could ever care for
-hat lame boy?"
He smiled grimly. She had been
right. Nature had set him apart, made
him a ioui.-garou, a solitary hobgoblin.
Ke had been unclubbable, sauvage,
even at Cambridge. And yet he had
had real friendships there; one espe
cially.
Gordon's free hand fumbled for his
fob and his fingers closed on a little
cornelian heart. It had been a keep
sake from his college classmate, Mat
thews, drowned in the muddy waters
of the Cam.
He released the bottle hurriedly,
strode to the window and flung it open.
A gust of rain struck his face and
spluttered in the candle, and the cur
tain flapped like the wing of some un
gainly bird. Out in the dark, beneath
a clump of larches, glimmered whitely
the monument he had erected to
"BoatÃwain," his Newfoundland. The
animal had gone mad.
"Some curse hangs over me and
mine!" he muttered. "I never could
keep alive even a dog that I liked or
that liked me!"
A combined rattle and crash be
hind him made him turn. The
wind had blown shut the door of
the cabinet with a smart bang,
and a yellow obiect, large and
round, had toppled from its shelf,
fallen and rolled to his very feet.
He started back, his nerves for the
lr.stant shaken. It waa a skull, mot
tled like a polished tortoise shell,
mounted in dull silver as a drinking
cup. He had unearthed the relic years
before with a heap of stone coffins
amid the rubbish of the abbey's ruined
priory â grim reminder of some old
friar â and Its mounting had been his
own fancy. He had forgotten its very
existence.
Now, as It lay aupine, yet intrusive,
the symbol at one time of lastingness
and decay, it filled him with a painful
fascination.
Picking it up, he Â«et it upright on
the desk, seized the bottle, knocked
ofi ltÂ« top against the marble mantel
and poured the fantastic goblet full.
"Death and life!" he mused. "One
feeds the other, eÂ»ch In turn. Life!
yet it should not be too long; I have
no conception of any existence which
duration would not render tiresome.
How else fell the angels? They were
immortal, heavenly and happy. It is
the lastingness of life that is terrible;
I see no horror in a dreamless sleep."
He put out his hand to the goblet,
but withdrew it.
"No â wait!" he said, and seating
himself at the desk, he seized a pen.
The lines he wrote, rapidly and with
scarcely an alteration, were to live for
many a long year â index fingers point
ing back to that dark mood that con
sumed him then:
Start not â nor deem tny spirit fled;
In me behold the only skull.
From which, unlike a living head.
Whatever flows it never dull.
I lived. I loved. I quaffed like tbee;
I died; let earth my bones resign.
Fill vp â thou canst not injure me;
The worm hath fouler lips than thins.
Better to hold the sparkling grape
Than mirs* the earth-worm's illmr brood;
And circle In the goblet's shape
The drink of gods, than reptile's food.
Quaff while thou canst; another rac*
When thou and thine, like me. are sped.
Mar rescue thee from earth's embrace.
And rhyme and revel with the dead.
He repeated the last stanza aloud
and raised the goblet in both hands.
'Rhyming and reveling â what else
counts? To drink the wine of youth
dre*s and then â good night! Is
there anything beyond? Who knows?
He who does cannot tell! Who tells us
there is? He who does not know!"
Did the dead know?
He set the wine down, pushing it
from him. sprang up, seized the candle
and entered the room on the other
side of the corridor. The bed curtains
were drawn close and a Bible lay open
or the night stand. He wondered with
a kind of impersonal pity if the book
had held comfort for her at last.
He held the candle higher, so its
rays lighted the page: "But the Lord
shall give thee there a trembling
heart, and falling of eyes, and sorrow
of mind. ... In the morning
thou shalt say. Would God it were
even! and at even thou shalt say.
Would God it were morning."
It stared at him painfully in black
letters, an age-old agony of wretched
ness. Had this been the keynote of
her lonely, fitful, vehement life? Had
years of misery robbed her â as it had
robbed him, too? A distressed douubt,
like a dire finger of apprehension,
touched him; he put out his hand and
drew aside the curtains.
Looking, he shuddered. Death had
lent her its mystery, its ineffaceable
dignity. He recognized it with a new
and inexplicable feeling, like rising
from the grave. Back of the placid
look, in abeyance, in the stirlessness
of the unringed hands â she had lost
her wedding ring years ago â some
quality, strange, unintimate, lay con
fronting him. He remembered his
words to Hobhouse in the street â
wor.is that had not been cold on his
lips when he read Fletcher's message.
Ever since, they had lain rankling
like a raw burn in some crevice of his
brain. "Lame brat!" And yet, be
neath her frantic rages, under the sur
face he had habitually disregarded,
what if in her own way she had really
loved h'm!
A clutching pain took possession of
him, a sense of physical sickness and
anguish. He dropped the curtain, and
stumbled from the room, down the
long stair, calling for the footman.
"Rushton," he shouted, "get the
muffles! Let us have a bout like the
old times." He threw off his coat,
pushed the chairs aside and bared his
arms. "The gloves, Rushton, and be
quick about it!"
"Never fear," 6aid Gordon, and
laughed â a tightening laugh that
strained the cords of his throat. "Put
them on! That's right! What are
you staring at? Do you think she will
hear you? Not she! Put up your
hands â so! Touched, by the Lord!
Not up to your old style, Rushton!
You never used to spar so villainously.
You will disgrace the fancy. Ah-h!"
And he knocked him sprawling.
Rushton scrambled to his feet as
the housekeeper entered, dismay up
on her mask-iike relic of a face. Gor
don was very white and both noticed
that his eyes were full of tears.
Long after midnight, when the place
was quiet, the housekeeper heard an
un:i''eustomed sound issuing from the
chamber where the dead woman lay.
She took a light and entered. The
candle had burned out, and she saw
Gordon sitting in the dark beside the
bed.
"Oh, Mrs. Muhl," he said, "she was
my mother! After all, one can have
but one in this world, and I have
only just found it out!"
CHAPTER VII.
The Youth in Fleet Prison.
Behind the closed shutters of the
bookshop which bore the sign of "The
Juvenile Library," in the musty room
where George Gordon had burned the
errant copies of his Ã¼biquitous Satire,
old William Godwin sat reading by a
guttering candle. Livy's Roman His
tory in the original. It was his fa
vorite book, and in the early even
ings, when not writing his crabbed col
umn for the Courier, or caustic dia
tribes for the reviews, he was apt to
be reading it. A sound in the living
room above drew his eyes from the
black-letter page.
"Jane!" he called morosely â "Jane
Clermont!"
A lagging step came down the stair
and a girl entered, black-eyed, Creole in
effect. Her cheeks held the flame of
the wild-cherry leaf.
"Where is your sister?"
"I have no sister."
The old man struck the table with
his open hand. "Where is Mary, I
say?"
"At the door."
"Go and see what she is doing."
The girl stood still, regarding her
stepfather with a look that under its
beauty had a sullen half-contempt.
"Why don't you do as I tell you?"
"I'm not going to be a spy for you,
even if you did marry my mother. I'm
tired of it."
The anger on the old man's face
harshened. "If you were my own flesh
and blood," he said sternly, "I would
flog that French impudence of yours
to death. As long as you eat my
bread you will obey me."
She looked at him with covert mock
ery on her full lips.
"I'm not a child any longer," she
said as she turned flauntlngly away;
"I could earn my bread easier than by
dusting tumble-down bookshelves. Do
you think I don't know that?"
To William Godwin this defiant un
tutored girl had been a thorn in the
side â a perpetual slur and affront to
the irksome discipline he laid upon his
own pliant Mary, the child of that first
wife whose loss bad warped his man
hood. Now he saw her as a live dan
ger, a flagrant menace whose wild
ness would infect his own daughter.
It was this red-lipped vixen who was
teaching her the spirit of disobedi
ence!
He raised his voloe and called sharp,
ly: "Mary!"
There was no answer and he shuffled
down the shabby hall to the street
door. The old man glowered at the
slender, beardless figure of the youth
who stood with her â the brown, long
coat with curling lambs-wool collar
and cuffs, Its pockets bulging with
mysterious books. In a senile rage he
ordered his daughter indoors.
Passers-by stopped to stare at the
object of his rancor, standing uncer
tainly in the semi-dusk, a brighter ap
parition, with luminous eyes and ex
travagant locks. Words came thickly
to the old man; he launched Into in
vective, splenetic and Intemperate, at
which the listeners tittered.
As it chanced, a pedestrian heard the
name he mouthed â a man sharp-fea
tured and ill dressed. With a low
whistle he drew a soiled slip of paper
from his pocket and consulted it by a
street lamp, his grimy forefinger run
ning down the list of names It con
tained.
"I thought so. Fve a knack for
names," he muttered, and shouldered
through the bystanders.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
â 'Not so fast, young master," he said,
laying his hand on the youth's arm;
"father's the way to the Fleet."
The other drew back with a gesture
of disgust. "The rleet?" he echoed.
"Aye." said the bailiff, winking to the
crowd; "the pretty jug: for folk as
sptnd more than they find in pocket;
with a nice grating to see your friends
so genteel like."
Breaking from her father's hand, the
girl In the doorway ran out with fear
in her blue eyes.
"Oh. where are you taking him?"
she cried.
The fellow smirked. "I'm just going
to show his honor to a hotel I know,
till he has time to see his pal Dellevelly
of Golden Square to borrow a tidy
eighteen pound ten, which a bookseller
not so far off will be precious glad to
Set." ,
"Eighteen pounds!" gasped the
youth, with a hysteric laugh. "Debtors'
prison for only eighteen pounds! But
I have the books stillâ he can have
them back."
"After you've done- with 'em, eh?"
said the bailiff. "Oh, I know your
young gentlemen's ways. Come along."
"Father!" cried the girl, indignantly,
as the bailiff dropped a heavy grasp
on the lambs-wool collar. "You'll not
let them take Shelley. You'll wait for
the money, father."
"Go into the house!" thundered the
old man. "He's a good-for-nothing
vagabond, I tell you!" He thrust her
back, and the slammed door shut be
tween TÂ»er and the youth standing in
the bailiff's clutch, half-wonderingly
and disdainfully, like a bright-eyed,
restless fox amid sour grapes.
"Go to your room!" commanded her
father, and the girl slowly obeyed,
dashing away her tears, while the old
bookseller went back to the cluttered
shop and his reading of Livy's Roman
History.
In the chamber the girl entered, Jane
Clermont looked up half-scornfully.
"I heard it all," she burst; "you are
a little fool to tafce itâ scolding you like
a child, and before all those people!"
Mary opened a bureau drawer and
took out a small rosewood box con
taining her one dearest possession. As
she stood Â»ith her treasure in her
hand, Jane Jumped to her feet.
"I've borne it as long as I can my
self," she cried under her breath. "I'm
going to run away before I am a fort
night older."
"Run away? Where?"
Jane had begun to dance noiselessly
on tiptoe with swift bacchante move
ments. "I'm going to be an ac
tress," she confided, as she stood at a
pirouette. "I've been to see Mr. Sheri
dan â the great Mr. Sheridan â and he's
promised to get me a trial in a real
part at Drury Lane!" She paused,
struck with the determination in the
other's face. "What are you going to
do?"
"I'm going to Shelley."
"Good! I'll go with you- But you
have no money. How can you help
him?"
Mary held out the little box.
"Your mother's brooch!" cried Jane.
"Do you really care as much as that
for him?"â a little satirically.
Her companion was dressing for the
street with rapid, uncertain fingers.
"It's all I have," she answered.
They sat in silence till they heard the
outer door bolted and knew the old
man below had gone to his own room.
Then they stole softly down the creak
ing stair, undid the outer door cau
tiously and went out Into the evening
bustle.
The pavements were crowded, and
Mary clung to her companon's arm, bat
Jane walked nonchalantly, her dark
eyes snapping with adventure. Not a
few turned to gaze at her piquant
beauty. To one whose way led In the
same direction it brought a thought of
a distant land.
"In a Suliote shawl she might be a
maid of Missolonjrhl!" mused George
Gordon, as he strode across Fleet mar
ket behind the two girls. "Greece! I
â wonder when I shall see it again!"
A shade of melancholy was in his
face as he walked on, but not discon
tent. The resentment of his London
home-coming and the desolation of that
first black night at Newstead he had
overcome. With the companionship of
his sister and in the calm freshness of
frosty lake and rolling wind-washed
moor he had recovered some of the
buoyant spirits so suddenly stunned by
the impact of the slanders that had
met him. The London papers he had
left unopened, from a sensitive dread
of seeing the recital of his mother's
well-known eccentricities, which her
death might furnish excuse for recall
ing. His new book, whose stanzas
stood like mental mile-posts of his
journey, had almost finished its pro
gress through the press. In Its verses
he hoped to stand for something more
than the petty caviling of personal
paragraphists. It was to his publish
er's he was bound this night when that
wistful thought of the shores he best
loved had shadowed his mood.
Crossing the open space on which
faced the dark brick front and barred
windows of the Fleet Prison, he saw
the two girlish forms pause before its
dismal entrance, where stood the shirt
sleeved warden, pipe in mouth- What
errand could have brought them there
unaccompanied at such an hour, he
wondered.
Just then the clock of St. Dunstan's
ln-the-West began a ponderous stroke,
and the warden knocked the ashes from
his pipe.
"Eight o'clock," he announced
gruffly. "Prison closed."
A cry of dismay fell from Mary's
lipsâ a cry freighted with tears. "Then
we can't get poor Bysshe!"
Gordon turned back and approached
the dingy portal. "I have a fancy to
see the inside of the old rookery,
warden," he said. "Perhaps these vis
itors may enter with me." His hand
was in his pocket and a jingle caught
the warden's acute ear. The gruff de
meanor of the custodian merged
precipitately into the obsequious.
He pushed open the gate with alac
rity and preceded them Into the foul
area of the prison.
Mary threw Gordon a quick glance
of gratitude as she passed into the
warden's office â to return without the
little rosewood box. Across the look
had flitted a shudder at the shouts and
oaths that tainted tl.e inclosure, and as
she emerged he caught the gleam of
relief with which she saw him still in
the court.
A moment later the bailiff, who had
figured in the scene before Godwin's
shop, was leading the way along a noi
some gallery. It was littered with refuse
of vegetable and provision men who
cried their wares all day up and down.
At one side gaped a coffee-house, at
the other an ordinary, both reeking
with stale odors and tobacco smoke,
and a noisy club was meeting In the
taproom. Laughter and the click of

breast-high, impromptu table, a

the page, was ; the room's solitary oc

John Murray, anax of publishers, sat
that evening in his shop In Fleet street.

fvHe; broke off abruptly. "The pamph- i
â \ leteers ' have \ been a busy \ since lhe land-
Ed," he admitted, a trace of shrewd
ness edging his tone, "but the abuse
seems to have dulled now. I have been
waiting for that to issue."
"His lordship, sir," announced a clerk
and the proprietor sprang to his feet to
greet his visitor.
Gordon' 3 eyes lighted with pleasure
as they fell on Dallas, noting the
change the few months of relief from
the galling pressure of poverty had
wrought in the features no less than
the attire. "Are the types ready?" he
asked the publisher.
"Yes, my lord. We distribute to
morrow. I, have marked a few stan
zas, however, that I hesitate to include
in a further edition. Here they are.
You will guess my reason."
The other looked, his eyes reading,
but his mind thinking further than the
page.
London! Right well thou know' it the hour
of prayer;
Then thy spruce citizen, washed artisan
And smug apprentice gulp their weekly air.
The lines were bitter, indeed! They
had been written when he was still
smarting under the lash of his earlier
critics, in the first months of his jour
neylngs, before the great wind of travel
had swept his mind clear and sweet
for the latter harmonies of his poesy.
In them lay the hurt sneer of a per
sonal resentment â the resentment that
had been in his soul when he sailed
from England; that had sprung alive
again on his return, when he learned
that his enemies had employed his ab
sence to bespatter his name with lying
tales.
Yet that was past. He had cast it
behind him. And should he carry the
old spirit Into this better and nobler
work, to deflect his message from its
significance into cheaper channels of
abuse? His thought recurred to the
youth in the bare room of the
Fleet. Even there, in a debtor's
prison, Shelley had forgot his own
plight, and sunk individual re
sentment in desire for wider
justice! Should he be less big in toler
ance than that youth? So he asked
himself, as the publisher casually flut
tered the leaves of an uncut review
which the clerk had laid on hi 3 desk.
All at pnee John Murray's eyes
stopped, fixed on a page. He made an
exclamation of irritation and chagrin,
and pushed it out toward Gordon. It
was a fresh copy of the Scourge, and
the leader Gordon read, while the pub
lisher paced the floor with nervously
angry strides, was the one in which
had been steeped the anonymous
venom of William Godwin the book
sellerâa page whose caption waa his
own name:
"It may be asked whether to be a
simple citizen is more disgraceful than
to be the Illegitimate descendant of a
murderer; whether to. labor in an hon
orable profession be less worthy than
to waste the property of others in vul
gar debauchery; whether to be the son
of parents of no title be not as honor
able as to be the son of a profligate
father and a mother of demoniac tem
per, and, finally, whether a simple uni
versity career be less indicative of vir
tue than to be held up to the derision
and contempt of his fellow students, as
a scribbler of doggerel and a bear
leader, to be hated for repulsiveness of
manners and shunned by every man
who would not be deemed a profligate
without wit and trifling? without ele
gance."
A cold dead look of mingled pain and
savagery grew on his face as he read.
Then frer^prang up and went to the
door. Behind him Dallas had seized
the review and was reading it with
indignation. The publisher was still
pacing the floor: "What an unfortu
nate advertisement!" he was mutter-
Ing.
Gordon stared out into the lamp
lighted street. The bitter malignancy
which had spared not even the grave
in its slander numbed and maddened
him. His breath came hard and a
mist was before his eyes. Opposite
the shop loomed the blackened front
of the old church of St. Dunstans-in
the-West; as he stood, the two wooden
figures of wild men on the clock
which projected over the street struck
the hour with their clubs, and a late
newsboy passed crying tiredly: "News
and Chronicle! Ail about the Frame-
Breakers shot in Nottingham!"
The volume the publisher had given
him was still in Gordon's hand. He
turned into the room and flung it on
the desk.
"No," he said with harsh bluntness.
"Not a line shall be altered! If every
syllable were a rattlesnake and every
letter a pestilence, they should not be
expunged! Let those who cannot
swallow, chew it. I will have none
of your damned cutting and slashing,
Murray. I will battle my way against
them all, like a porcupine!"
Then he wheeled and plunged Into
the clack and babble of Fleet street's
pedestrians.
London would be reading his effusion
when his book appeared to-morrow â
reading it and talking about it. "The
curs!" he said to himself, as he walked
fiercely down the Strand.
The cry of the newsboy ahead came
back to him like a dulled refrain. He
turned into Whitehall at Charing
Cross, and looked up to find himself
opposite Melbourne House. He re
membered suddenly the clear-eyed girl
to whom he had offered his
Satire and whose coin was
still in his waistcoat pocket,
she had said "Melbourne House"
that day to the coachman. He won
dered with a curious levity whether
she would read the Scourge.
Before the House of Parliament
stood a double line of carriages.
"It's the debate in the Lords on the
Frame-Breakers bill," he heard one
passer-by Inform another, as he stared
frowning at the high Gothic entrance.
That was the measure against which
Shelley's pamphlet had been written.
The pain waa dulling and the old
unyielding devil of challenge and*nght
was struggling uppermost. ' 'The
illegitimate descendant of a murder
er!'" â Gordon muttered â "'a scrib
bler of doggerel and a bear leader!' '
Then suddenly he raised his head.
His eyes struck fire like gray flint. "I
am a peer," he said through his teeth,
and strode through the door, which
he had never entered in his life but
once.
An hour later there was a sensa
tion In John Murray's shop, where
Dallas sat. It was furnished by Sheri
dan, who came in taking snuff and
shaking: his gray head with delight.
"Heard the news?" he cried, chuck
ling:. "George Gordon just made a
great speech â best speech by a Lord
since the Lord knows when! I was in
thÂ« gallery with Lady Melbourne and
Lady Caroline Lamb. He opposed the
Frame-Breakers bill. They say it
means the death of the measure. You
should have seen the bigwigs flock
to offer congratulations! Why, even
the Lord Chancellor came down from
the woolsack to shake hands with
him!" He paused out of breath, with
a final, "What d'ye think of that?"
"Well, well!' ejaculated the pub
lisher, taking off his glasses and pol
ishing them with vigor. He looked at
Dallas.
â  What an unfortunate advertise
ment!' quoth that gentleman, pull
ing his nose. "Eh?"
John Murray brought his fist down
on the foot of the desk with a force
that made the inkwell leap. "By the
foot of Pharaoh!" he swore, "we'll
t:.ke advantage of it; it will discount
that attack in the Scourge. The pa
pers have their copies of the book al
ready. I'll send them word. We'll
not wait to-morrow. We'll Issue to
night!"
He rang the bell sharply and gave a
dirk hurried orders which in a few
moments made the office a scene of
confusion.
When Lady Melbourne entered
Melbourne House with her daughter
in-law that evening â about the time
a swarm of messengers were departing
from tha Fleet-street shop carrying
packages of books addressed to the
greatest houses of London â she found
her stately niece. Annabel Mllbanke.
reading ir. th*> drawing-room.
Lady Carolines eyes were very
bright as she threw off her wraps. She
vent to the piano and played softly â
long: dissolving arpeggios that melted
into a rich minor chord. Presently
she began to sing the same Greek air
that she had sung once before with a
pathos that had surprised and stirred
even the colder, calculate Annabel.
"Caro. what is that?" asked Lady
Melbourne, unclasping her sables be
fcre the fireplace. The singer did not
hoar her.
Lady Melbourne's thoughts were not
wholly on the song. She had seen the
book her niece had been reading â it waa
George Gordon's long famous Satire.
She picked It up, noting- the name on
the title page with approval. She had
been pondering since she left the la
dies' gallery of the House of Lords, and
her thoughts had concerned themselves
intimately with its autnor, the young
peer whose maiden speech had chal
lenged such surprise and admiration.
His name went perpetually accompa
nied by stories of eccentricities and
wild life at coilege, of tamed bears and
hidden orgies at Newatead with Pa
phian dancing: girls, of a secret estab
lishment at Brighton, of adventures
and liaisons the most reckless in cities
of the Orient. Yet he had stanch sup
porters, too.
"Annabel." shft said presently, and
with singular emphasis, "George Gor
don is in town. He spoke in Parlia
ment this evening. I am going to ask
him to dinner here to-morrow â to meet
you."
The refrain Lady Caroline was sing
ing broke queerly in the middle, and
her fingers stumbled on the keys. The
others did not see the expression that
slipped swiftly across her face, the ris
ing flush, the Indrawn bitten undei
Up, nor did they catch the undertone lri
her laugh as she ran up the stair.
In her own room she unlocked a
metal frame that stood on her dressing:
table. It held a pencil portrait, begged
10-ng before from Hobhouse. A vivid,
conscious flush was in her cheeks M
she looked at It. -
"For a woman of fire and dreams'
she murmured. "Not for a thins ot
snow! Never â never!"
CHAPTER IX.
Gordon Wakes and Finds Himself
Famous.
The sharp jostle of the pavement; the
rattle of the crossings; the "this way,
m'loxdr" of dodginsr linkboys and the
hoarse warning of the parochial watch
to reckless drivers; street lamps flar
ing redly in the raw and heavy night;
the steaming tap-rooms along the
Thames: the cut-throat darkness and
the dank smell of the slow turgid cur
rent under London bridge. Still Gordon
walked while the hour dragged till the
traffic ebbed to midnight's lull â on and
on, without purpose or direction. It
was dawn before he entered his lodg
ings, fagged and unstrung, with blood
pumping and quivering in his veins
like quicksilver.
He let himself In with his own key.
The door of the antechamber which
his valet occupied was ajar. Fletcher
had been waiting for his master; he
was dressed and seated in a chair, but
his good-natured, oleaginous face was
smoothed in slumber.
Gordon went into his sitting- room,
poured out a half goblet of cognac and
drank it to the last drop, feeling grate
fully its dull glow and grudging release
from nervous tension.
His memory of his speech was
a sort of rough-drawn composite im
pression whose salient points were color
and movement: the wide groined roof,
the peaked and gilded throne, the crim
son woolsack, the long, red morocco
sofas set thickly, the rustle in the
packed galleries and peers leaning in
their seats to speak In low tones with
their neighbors.
The majority there had not known
him, but his paleness, his beauty, his
curling hair, and most of all his lame
ness, told his name to the few. The
few whispered it to the many, they in
turn gazed and whispered, too. and al
most before he had uttered a word the
entire assemblage knew that the speak
er was the notorious writer of the fa
mous Satire, whose winged Apollonian
shafts had stung the whole poetic cult
of England â the 24-year-old lord whose
name was coupled in the newspapers
with unlovely tales of bacchanals In
Madrid, duellos in Malta and Gibral
tar, and harem intrigues in Constanti
nople; tales half-believed even by those
who best knew what enemies his vit
riolic pen had made and their oppor
tunities for slander.
Gordon had acted In a mental world
created by excitement. His pride had
spurred him. In a moment of humilia
tion, to thrust himself Into the place
he of right should occupy. Mere ac
cident had chosen the debate; the cas
ual circumstance of a visit to the Fleet
Prison had determined his position in
It. Given these, his mind had respond
ed clearly, spontaneously, with a grasp
and brilliancy of which he himself had
been scarcely conscious. He remem
bered, with a curious impersonal won
der as he walked, the sharp, strain
ing, mental effort before that battery
of glances coldly formal at first, then
surprised Into approval and at length
warmed to enthusiastic applause; the
momentary hush as he sat down;' the
buzz of undammed talk crisped by the
tap of the gavel; the press of congrat
ulations which followed him to the out
er air.

fT>OM FOSTER stood on the sum
n:it line, looking into the "prom
ised land." The mountain waa
I shagrgred with oak and manianita
and madrcme, and frothed herr
and there with bear-berry bloom. Be
yor.d, dimpled the hills, and farther
still lay the prune orchards, like giant
patchwork, spread over the valley. To
the northwest a silver rim marked the
bay.
Fester leaned on his gun, absently
vhiFtling in a minor key; then, quite
.rs if the thought were a fresh one, he
vent through his lunch box again;
there was not bo much as a cracker.
A paper rustled as his arm brushed his
M ; he drew out an envelope and
ecowled at it. He had tramped since
dav.-n in a vain endeavor to forget that
this tvas the 2<Uh, and here was Bob's
letter! Opening it. he began to read as
though he did not know the contents
by heart.
"Dear Tom," it ran. "And so you're
to be married on the 27th!"
Foster tore the paper into bits. It
had been three months since the quar
rel and now he could scarcely remem
ber whether he or Ruth had been to
blame- Where was ehe? Did she re
member what night this was? He
vondered if she had been miserable,
too.
In the west, a sun, luridly yellow like
en over-ripe pumpkin, was leisurely
going to bed. Shadcrws limbed them
telveÂ» Into the canyon; the Guadalupe
hills turned pink; beyond towered
Mount Hamilton, a huge amethyst with
a pearl at it 6 apex. In them all, Fos
ter saw the reproachful eyes of a girL
He v/as tired in head and heart and
legs. With an instinct to be out of the
way of temptation, he put his last cart
ridge into the gun, took aim at a cluster
of manzanlta bloom some fifty feet
away, and shattered it.
When the smoke cleared he saw
what he had not previously noticed â
a small white house crowning a "su
g;ar loaf." A road, like a big scar,
stretched diagonally up the mountain,
dipped into the canyon and came out
again on the loaf. Without further
thought, Foster swung the gun to his
shoulder and broke through the
brush.
The sun went the way of suns and
a nijrht breese came up the canyon.
The corn patch on the sugar loaf
â¢whispered like a woman's skirts. It
reminded Tom of wedding gowns. And
Ruth was â where?
Within the confines of the little
ranch the road cut through a billow
of cliaparral bloom to the barn. The
barn doors were open through a pad
lock hung unclapsed in the staple. To
the overwrought man breath of
the hay waa soothing, enticing. Far
ther on the house stood in a bit of a
garden. There were patches of petu
nia and lettuce, onions and mignon
ette, growing in democracy.
Foster knocked at the front door.
Receiving no response, he tried the
back door. Then, putting his. hands
to the sides of his head like a horse's
blinders, he peered through the rear
windows. A fresh baking- of bread
stood on the kitchen table and it
brought to him anew the fact that he
was hungry. With the instinct of the
animal and the savage that "might
makes right," and In need, whatever
he could get was legally his, Foster
tried the knob. It gave to him and
he wtnt In.
The light was growing dim, but he
found a lamp and matches. To make
sure that he waa alone, he reconnol
tered the two adjoining rooms. In
the first there waa a couch and shelves
of books, a low sewing-chair and a
partially mended pink frock. The
frock reoDened the wound In his
heart; Ruth had worn pink when they
quarreled. In the other room there
wan a bed and dresser. Satisfied, he
closed the door behind him as he re
turned to the kitchen.
A coffee pot stood on the shelf with
a canister beside It. Foster helped

himself and, pumping water by the
back door, he added it and lighted a
kerosene ptove. The breeze brought
him a whiff from the garden. A mo
ment later he was whistling "She's All
the World to Me," as he pulled let
tuce and onions.
The new-baked bread was good. The
man, tilted back in his chair, remem
bered that this was to have been his
w r edding eve, but a peace, such as he
had not known for three months, was
upon him. He piled the empty dishes
and wrote two words, "Thank you,"
en a piece of brown paper; then he
thought of the barn.
The oat hay was like a perfumed
l.arcotic- and Tom Foster stretched
his spent body. His lids were heavy;
he was driftiog â drifting with her.
She wore a pink frock â no, it was
white; it waa scented with orange

Ruth Armstrong drew the Sunday
papers from her postotnee box and
looked a second time to make sure
there was no letter. She had been
certain that Tom would remember the
date â that he would somehow trace
her and write. The last three months
had been lonely and it didn't matter
v.ho had been to blame. If he urged
her to â perhaps â
The constable left a group of men,
talking in the doorway of the office,
and sauntered toward her.
"The sun's down, Miss Armstrong,"
he began, as If it were news. "Going
up the mountain to-night?"
She nodded, forcing a smile.
"Whew!" he breathed. "Why, your
mother's in the city! You aren'tâ
aione?"
"Well, I'm not afraid if I am," she
made answer.
"N-o, I suppose not." He came
nearer, lowering his voice in mock
confidence, as he said, "But if you
run across a tall, well-set-up stranger
carrying a gun on your mountain, you
want to bag the game, that's aIL
There's a hundred dollars reward for
that fellow/ he concluded.
The girl's eyes rounded and the con
stable chuckled.
"Oh, I wouldn't stay out nights to
look for him," he advised, "though
half the men in town'd be out if it
wasn't for the gun!"
He turned, walked out of the office
with Ruth and across the sidewalk to
her horse. Unfastening the bridle
rein, he stood, still smiling down at
her, his thoughts full of the stranger.
"He can pick an elderberry off its
bush with that gun," he said, "or a
topknot off a quail. He gave a sort
of free exhibition yesterday, then,"
chuckling, "last night he Took the best
stuff in Barnaby's jewelry store and
racked It in a lunch box. Some folks
saw him and the gun headed for the
Almaden. The Sheriff's out there
now."
The girl swung herself to the cross
saddle.
"If I find him," she nodded, "I'll let
you know."
Beyond the lone pine which marked
the town limits the road turned at
right angles to begin its circuitous
climb. Over the mountain hung a
callow moon and one white star. They
blurred and merged in each other
through the tears in Ruth's eyes. Let
ting her horse choose its gait, she gave
herself up to misery. This was to have
been her wedding-eve! She thought of
the bridesmaids, of the gowns and of
Tom. The presents would have been
coming, and to-morrowâ
From the trees came the tones of
nestling birds. A hundred lights

sprang out in the town; here and there
on the hills glowed other lights, and
each one stood for a home! She alone
was jogging upâ up into the face of
the star. And he was â where?
The dew began to fall and the flow
ers spilled their perfume, laurel and
wild honey-suckle and columbine. A
gossamer thread set afloat by a spider
caught on her cheek. The girl dug
her spurs Into the horse's flanks and
blinked hard. At the house she'd make
a cup of strong coffee, andâ andâ go to
bed!
On the sugar-loaf the wind still whis
pered in the cornstalks; the barn doors
creaked as they swung. Ruth unsad
dled her horse and turned him loose
In the paddock. The bridle and saddle
she thrust inside the barn; then she
went into the house by the back way.
The kitchen was dark and chill. An
added sense of desolation came to her
that on this night of nights, the 26th,
her mother should of necessity leave
her aione!
Striking a match, she hunted for the
coffee-pot and found it on the stove.
There were grounds in it. A per
plexed pucker crept between her
brows. She hummed persistently as
she rinsed the pot and started fresh
coffee, shaking the canister to make
sure that its contents were safe. The
cream had been skimmed from the
morning's milk. Out from a pile of
childhood's memories crept the story
of the '"three Bears."
" 'Somebody's tasted my porridge, 1 "
she quoted. Then her glance fell on the
bread.
Suppressing a scream, Ruth caught
up a lamp and holding it above her
head, peered cautiously into the ad
joining rooms. They were untenanted.
She looked courageously under the bed.
Her revolver lay on the bookshelf
bae grasped it and tremblingly made
tbe rounds of the doors, locked ihem
and pulled down the shades.
From Uw piiddock came a prolonged
nicker; tiie huJM wanted hay.
Kuth Armstrong, standing in the
kitchen, saw the pile of empty dishes
and the two words, "thank you," and
her heart grew faint.
Again the horse called. In the attic,
the wood warped by the heat was cool
ing off. It creaked successively, like
steps.
Kuth lighted a candle; the vague
thought came to her that dumb com
panionship was better than none. She
would feed the horse and sleep in the
paddock.
In the sky, the youthful moon still
hung. The mountain 1 was black. A
lonesome owl hooted in the timber and
the lights of town looked distant ms
stars. The girl's throat was dry; nei
heart beat in her ears. Tlie barn door
swung out and she steppei inside. Set
ting the candle or. the feed box she
turned to the hay.
A man was stretched face downward
before her! Beside him was a gun and
a lunch box!
Outwardly calm, with the calm born
of a crisis, Ruth stared at him. The
words of the constable rang in her
ears. In that box must be "the beat
stuff in Barnaby's jewelry store!" She
tried to move, but terror fettered her.
In his sleep, the man half-turr.cd,
murmuring a name. His face was to
the hay.
A rush of hysterical, Incongruous
thoughts flooded the girl. He would
wakenâ there wou:i be another "free
exhibition" with the gun. This was
to have been her wedding eve, .' nd her
mother was away! She didn't want to
die â not yet! She was young:
The breathing of the man became
regular; he snored a little, his exhala
tions coming In puffs. Tossing one
muscular arm behind him, it fell un
consciously on the gun, and the fet
ters binding Ruth broke.
She extinguished the glimmer from
the candle and flitted from the barn.
The doors creaked as she rushed them
together; the padlock into
place. A fit of trembling seized her;
she sank to the ground, grasping her
revolver in both hands.
Fog was threading its way up the
canyon; the black tops of the laurels
rose like islands from the mist. On
a spur of the mountain rang the
staccato challenge of a coyote. It was
answered. Beyond the pack yelped
and snarled.
On the ground, weak of knee, but
flint-faced, Ruth sized up the situation.
She had this man in custody. She
couldn't let him out; he would kill her!
She couldn't keep him In; he would
starve !
The horse, nickering in his paddock,
gave her an inspiration. She started
up, then sank slowly back, remember
ing the bridle and saddle were In the
barn. The fog swooged aruund the
sugar-loaf and the girl shivered. She
dared not go in the house; she dared
not stay outside, and a luminous streak
in the mist stood for town! There was
but one thing to do.
Along the road fog dripped from the
over-hanging brush. Trees stood out
in sudden evidence and faded, ghost
like into the gray. Ruth sped past.
The pungent night breath of worm
wood and everlasting flower came up
to her. Tom had liked everlasting
flower! She slipped and caught her
self, half-crying, and a dislodged stone
spilled off the grade, bounding into
the ravine. This was to have been
their wedding-eve! If there was some
one to understandâ to know!
Another bend In the road. The lu
minous streak of the town grew white.
Between it and her stood a man. Ruth
swerved, but a. hand arrested her.
"What's 'the matter?" he asked. The
tones were deep, kindly, sympathetic.
A gun and a lunchbox were thrust be
hind him, but the Rirl did not see.
And the man was blg-*-like Tom!
The hand closed over hers. It was
warm and Rut 1 held on to it. Her
heart opened.
"There's a thÂ»ef !n our barn!" she
panted. "I've lacked him in! I'm go
ing for the cor nable!" A prolonged
shi\er ehook hÂ» r. but the has*
close on hers. "Oâ h," she wailed,
"he's been after coffee! In the bottom
of the canister there was $70! Help
me! Help me!' '.
"Sure!" said t- c man.
They stood soVor a momentâ Â«he un
nerved, he com;Srting.
"I'll go for 'ie constable myself,**
he suggested.
"No, no, no!" *he begged. Then with
the comradeship which comes with a
con mon danger.- she added, 'I couldn't
go back! You 50 and keep watch at
the barn!"
Again she â¼is on the way. The
streets of the Uwn were deserted. The
electric lights swung like low hung
sta rs.
The bell on the constable's house
pealed under Ruth's hand. A white
figure appeared at the window.
"I've got hira!" she cried. "It's I,
Ruth Armstrong! I've got him!"
"Got â who?" The constable's
tones were a!eÂ»py.
"The thief! And all the thins*
from Barnaby's jewelry store. H?
tried to g^ out" The truth
stretched under excitement. "But I
drove him back! And the gun! And
the jewels! There's a man on guard! "
'VVh â ew!" the constable whistled.
Ten minutes lat>r he tucked Ruth
into his buggy. " Ve'll stop for tha
Sheriff," he said with precaution.
thinking of the gun.
The Sheriff had been home but two
hours from the Almaden. He got Into
his clothes while the constable t.
"Yes. sir!" The constable brought
his flat into the hollow of his other
hand. "And she, single-handed â
mother in the city â not a blamed soul
within call â she wiled that rascal into
the barn and locked him up! Show
fight? I guess so!"
The Sheriff routed out a deputy.
"He knocked her down twice!" the
Sheriff explained, as they turned in
by the lone pine. "After she got him
locked in she went for â a neighbor.
She could hear him battering the
door an eighth of a mile away!"
"Jerusalem! What a girl!" breathed
the deputy.
Two teams emerged from the fog
on the sugar-loaf. Three officers of
the law and a girl, white, tense, ex
pectant, surrounded the barn.
There was no figure on guard.
The deputy whisked out a pair of
handcuffs. At the door he listened,
then beckoned to> the others. They
came cautiously, their guns ready.
, A rhythmic peaceful snore came
from the hay.
The men faced one another and a
breeze rustled a paper pinned on the
door. The Sheriffs hand was unsteady
as he took it off. Turning his lantern
on it he said:
"To the constable: Tou might as well
mosey on. The girl was a good one.
Tell her I'll take care of the seventy."
"It isn't true!" Ruth cried, her Toice
shrill. "He's in there now! Don't you
hear?"
For answer the constable slipped &
tool under the staple. It squeaked In
the wood, gave, and the door swung.
The Sheriff shot In his lantern.
Tom Foster turned over. "Hello!'*
he exclaimed, struggling to als feet.
"What's up?"
An open, empty lunch-box and a
gun lay beside him.
'Why. gentlemen," he courteously
began; then he saw Ruth.
She was sobbing ecstatically. To
the east, a crimson band lay behind
the Guadaloupe hills. Unmindful of
the audience, she turned her face, like
a dew-drenched flower to his.
"1 â was so sure you'd remember â
the 27th. Tom," she brokenly whis
pered, "and come back. So very, very
sure!"
And the constable, the Sheriff, and
the deputy, using strange epithets,
rode home in the breaking dawn.A CHANGE OF PROFESSION
/^YORMAN and Hanrafcan. the two
4 /^probationers newly assigned to
\la Engine Company No. â , were the
V^" first of their crew to reach the
roof ,of the sixteen-story Mansard
. "building. They had the nozzle of a
line of hose that was being laid from
â¢ the staridpipe of the top floor to wet
down the north wall of the "skyscrap
. er"; and they came out into the night.
dragging their length of the line, to
'ace a gale of wind that took the
breath from between their teeth. They
struggled against It, through the dark
* cess, toward the light of fire over the
parapet; and they looked down there,
through the smoke, at the flames in
the roof of an adjoining clothing house
twelve stories below them.
Captain Ball had followed them.
"Turn on your water," he bellowed
above the storm to the men behind
them; and in a moment a feeble
stream swelled the line of hose and
gushed from the "pipe." He swore at
it. "It can't spit past its chin," he
said.
It strengthened slowly as they
watched It. "Keep wettin' her down,",
he shouted in Gorman's ear. "Get up
another line," he cried to the rest of
the crew.
The rushing of the wind drowned
their answer, but they hurried below
to obey him. He remained with Gor
man and Hanrahan. watching the fire
spread and brighten in the roof of the
clothing house. Gorman was still grin
ning at the "Can't spit past its chin."
They were two hundred feet above
the street level, and the storm, hurl
ing itself across the huddled roofs be
low them, drew up a draft of heat and
Kinoke to them as if they were looking
down a chimney. They could guess
what the heat must be in the street,
for across the road the woodwork of
the windows of a five-story building
1 had caught fire without the touch of
any flame, and a pygmy crew were
drenching it with a stream which they
. Â£het up straight from the sidewalk.
Officers the size of manikins ran up
and down in the ruddy glow, waving
their little arms. The fire flowed over
, the roof as if it were a burning oil;
and the smoke came up to them thick
er and the heat more stifling with every
breath.
Their weak stream dribbled down
the wall, to dry out on the hot bricks
btfore it touched the point of danger;
and Gorman leaned over the parapet
to see that the paint was beginning to
peel ' off in great scales far below.
Hanrahan and he tried hopelessly to
reach these by swinging the pipe from
cide to side. They might as well have
tried to Irrigate a desert with it. Their
eyes were dry and beginning to smart.
The rest of the crew came up again,
dragging a second line.
Captain Ball turned to the lieuten
ant. "No use brlngln' more lines up
here," he shouted. "Windows '11 be
breakln'. There ain't a shutter on the
â whole blamed bulldin*. Fireproof!
She's matchwood! Back down to the
twelfth floor. Get lines stretched to
the airshaft there."
The men want back with their hose.
"Do the best you can up here," he
advised Gorman. "Chiefs orders to
wet her down. Look out for the alr
efcaft"
Gorman caught the first of these in
structions, but the wind carried away
that last warning of danger, and the
captain turned and left the two men
unconscious of the catastrophe which
â¢was preparing for them.
The airehaft, in fact, was acting as
a sheltered flua for the flames. It cut
a deep groove into the wall of tha
Mansard building: at Gorman's left,
and the wind, rushing Into It, rose
straight aloft, blowing up sparks like
f the draft of a blast furnace. Gorman,
v * etching only thÂ« wall and the win
dow* below him, pitied th* crews at
work In the street. He was wishing
for a quid of chawing tobacco, and ha
remembered with exasperation that
Hanrahan would have none. That was
one of Hanrahan's social limitations â
he did not chew. He had been nick
named "Delicate Pete" by his fellow
probationers at fire headquarters, and
Gonnan â was known as "Bull"
Gorman, being the big man of his
clzss â had despised him from the day
â¢ that the instructor, having pitted them
(against each other in a race with
scaling ladders, had then publicly
compared Gorman to a baby hippo
potamus in point of nlmbleness be
cause Hanrahan had run away from
him.
These two were being "broken" to
gether with all the hard work of the
company, but there was no friendship
between them. They rarely spoke to
each other, for Gorman had found
Hanrahan's conversation all "hot air
an' : m silver," and had quarreled
I with him about this wearisome enthu
siasm for politics. They continued
stolidly at their work, now, in the
silence of mutual indifference. The
growing strength of the stream threat
ened to tear the nozzle from their
hands, and they raised the hose to
their shoulders to bend It in a swan's
neck arch that sent the water hissing
down the bricks.
They were busied so, when they saw
a bluish-green flame flash .In the red
of the fire In -he roof below, and a
belch of smoke rolled up to them on
the burst and echo of an explosion. Be- .
fore it reached them they heard an
other roar beneath it; the ; cloud : of
smoke was split with flame, and they
leaped back from the parapet as if
from the crater of a volcano, and
threw themselves on their faces, as
the burning gases, freed by the col
lapse of the roofâ flaring 200 feet in the
air and licking up the side of the Man
sard building, to break every window
glass In Its upper ten stories and Ignite
every window curtain, window sash
and "trim" in its north wallâ rolled
over them in a heat that nipped their
ears like a frostbite and was gone.
Gorman pinned down the pipe that
was threshing about on the roof, and
staggered back to the parapet with it.
The beat of heat was unendurable, and
he could see nothing for the smoke that
blinded him with tears. He did not
know that the gale was carrying a solid
tongue of fire Into the hidden airshaft,
and that every window on that shaft
waÂ« already spitting flames. He could
Just see that the woodwork of the win
dow below him was afire, and he called
Hanrahan to train the pipe on It with
him. They doused it black at once,
and scattered the smoke, to see another
blaze below. Then, suddenly, tha
stream from their hose weakened and
fell short. It was plain that the
crews were using the water on tha
lower floors.
"We're wanted down below, I
guess," Hanrahan said. "We're no good
up here now."
Gorman nodded. They shut off tha
nozzle and turned to drag the line to
the ddor of tha stairs.
They were too lata. Gorman saw
the blaze In the airshaft and cried out
an oath. That shaft, he knew, lit the
stairway from the ground up, and cut
them off from the elevator shaft In
the center of the building. They
dropped the line and ran to the door.
Smoke was pouring from It, and flame
was behind tha smoke. Oorman ran
back for the hose, turned the neck
guard of the helmet over his face and,
with the water to open the way for
him, fought down three steps Into a
blaze that could not be faced. The
wind, blowing In the broken windows
of the airshaft, brought up a smother
of heat and smoke against which his
pipe was useless. He was fighting a
prairie fire with the stream of an ex
tinguisher.
Hanrahan pitched forward on his
shoulders. Gorman braced himself
against the weight turned to catch
him under the armpits and carried
him up, himself half suffocated, to lay
him on the roof. They were greeted
by the fierce purring of the flames.
Hanrahan groaned.
"Y f all right?" Gorman asked him.
He rolled his eyes. "Let's get down
out of this," he gasped.
Gorman straightened up and looked
around him. The doorway was the
only entrance to the roof. He walked
back, to kick the useless hose down
the staircase and chut the tin-sheathed
door on the blaze below. He went to
the stone railing that surmounted tha
cornice on the front of the building.
The coping overhung the lowef, win
dows In a sheer drop to the street. He

He could see that there was nothing
on the brick roof to burn; the heat aad

a dir>. I want you to help me get that
ladder loose."
Hanrahan slipped his arm around his
neck, raising himself on his elbow.
"Get me down out of this. Bull." he
whispered, "Get me down out of this
an' I'll make it good. I got a pull. I
got a promise â "
Gorman threw off his arm. "Stop
talkin" foolish. I can't get you down,
man. Here, take a drink."
Hanrahan caught at his collar,
thrusting aside the water. "Get ma
down." he said. "You get me down.
Bull. I'll make it good. I'm right in
with the gang. Dorgan said "'
Gorman threw him from him with a
curse. "I can't get you down," he
yelled at him. "What's the matter
with you?"
Hanrahan fell back heavily, and lay
breathing hard, with open mouth. A
puff of smoke blew down and choked
him with a sob.
Gorman dragged him across the roof
to the tank and sat down beside him â
uncertain what to doâ with his back to
the parapet and his face to the light
well. The heat swam over them in a
suffocating current. Hanrahan threw
out his arms and lay as if stretched on
a cross, rolling his head from side to
side, agonized and speechless.
He began to mumble the "confession**
of a Roman Catholic, beating his
breast with a whispered "through my
fault, through my fault, through my
most grievous fault."
Gorman scowled. The smoke irritat
ed him; the heat pricked him. "Can't
you shut yer yap for half a minute?"
he complained.
Hanrahan groaned and turned to
him. "D'you think there's any hell?"
he asked in a husky whisper.
Gorman laughed. "Aw, cut it out,"
he said. "You're scared. That's all
that's wrong with you."
There was a crash of breaking win
dows in the airshaft. The flames roar
ed up, flapping like a banner in the
wind.
"Help!" Hanrahan screeched. "Help!
He; "
Gorman clapped a hand over his
mouth. "Well, you lobster," ha said.
"Aw, don't, Bull," he pleaded.
"Don't!"
Gorman stood up in the thickening
smoke and looked down on him. "Say,"
he said, "if you got any breath to
waste, you'd better save it fer yer
prayers. This roof's going to drop you
in a hole so hot it won't leave enough
of ycu fer the devil to raise a blister
on. Shut up, will you?"
He turned away from him. and
climbed the ladder to the top of the
tank, so that he might sit down there
in quiet. He could hear the engines in
the street whistling frantically for
coal from the fuel wagons, and they
sounded very far away. He reached
down into the scuttle and drank from
his helmet again. The air came up
cool from the lank. He lay with his
face in the draft of it, and shut his
dry eyelids on his aching eyes.
Although he had threatened Han
rahan with the collapse of the roof, he
had spoken in anger, to terrify him
Into silence, and not because ha be
lieved that either of them would lose
his life. He was not a man of imag
ination, and his breath was too strong
in his body for him to realize the pos
sibility of death. If the crew below
did cot find some means of reaching
him, he hoped to live out the flre where
he was. Chiefly, he was angry â and
bewildered by his own angerâ because
Hanrahan had gone to pieces and made
such a noise. He could not think. Tha
heat was wearing on him. Ha lay there
waiting.
And In fact the men below were al
ready planning to reach him. For a
time Captain Ball had been so busy
fighting back the flames on the twelfth
floor that he did not think of tha two
men whom he had left on the roof. It
was not until sparks and burning
woodwork began to pour down the ele
vator shaft that the possibility of tha
situation occurred to him. Fortunate
ly the building was "fireproofed' and
the progress of the flames would ba
slow.
He called two of hhs rew to get scal
ing ladders, and. leaving his lieutenant
in charge of the pipes, he ran to the
southwest er.fl of the building â to be
farthest from the fire â and opening a
window there, looked up. He could sea
no signs of fire in any windov. above
him. "Looks all right, ' he told the
raon. "But you'll have to be quick.
Keep your ayes open for the windows
behind you."
They had a coll of life line and two
ladders. They used but one of the
latter, golns ud together for greater
speed. At the first window they saw
the wisdom of Captain Ball's instruc
tions. The room within was stifling
with smoke and heat, and as soon as
they opened a vent in it the tire showed
in the darkness.
At the fourteenth story a light of
flames was already glimmering behind
the broken pane. The smoke poured
out on them as they beat in the glass
and hauled up the ladder. They went
ahead, however, and while they were
climbing up the wall from that window
they heard the rush of a "back draff
below them and looked down to see tha
flames in the thirteenth story cutting
them off.
A cry of warning from Captain Ball
was answered by a faint shout above
them. They looked up to see Gorman
peering down over the edge of the
water tank. Captain Ball shouted to
them, "Coma down the rope!" They
looked down to see him waving to
them. They looked up to see that Gor
man hcd disappeared. â¢
"Jim." the upper man said, "we can't
reach "em." They tied the end of their
rope hurriedly around the shaft of the
ladder, and each took & twist of it in
the hook of his belt and dropped.
They slid down through flre and
smoke, blistered and blinded, to Cap
tain Ball, who caught each as ha came
and drew him In the window. A fire
man sent by tba lieutenant came up
shouting, "Fire's at tha elevator
abaft!" They turned and ran.
Gorman had gone down to the roof
to get Hanrahan and found him lying
on his face on the bricks.
"The men're comln' up the ladders,"
he said. Hanrahan sprang to his feet
with this new hope of life and followed
him around the tank to the parapet.
They looked down to sea the empty
ladder, twenty feet below them, hang
ing in the flames, with a biasing rope
dangling from the center of It Into the
smoke. "Hell!" Gorman said disgust
edly.
Hanrahan started at the abandoned
apparatus. "I guess," he said, in a
new voice.
He turned back with Gorman to the
front of the tank again. There was a
lull in the wind; tha smoke and the
flames rose up straight on two sides
of the roof and the bricks were hot
under their feet. There was no escape
now. "We got one chance left," Gor
man said. "We can get In the tank."
Hanrahan shook his head. "No use.
Bull." he answered. "I got to cash In,
I guess."
Gorman cursed him. "Well. I ain't,"*
he said. "Get a hold of this ladder."
He braced himself with a foot
against the tin covering of the tank,
bent his back and tugged to loosen the
ladder from its fastenings. Hanrahan
helped him. They strained and strug
gled with all the strength of every
muscle, and the great screws in th*
sockets of the uprights came out slow
ly as if they had been sunk in wax.
Once having loosened its hohl, they
levered the ladder, twisted It. and
wrenched it free. Gorman crawled un
der the steel beams and turned off the
stopcock there. Then '.hey both
climbed aloft, lowered the ladder Into
the tank and slid down, one on each
side of the rungs, into the water. They
drank together, sunk to the teeth.
Gorman ducked. "You'd better tie
yourself on." he spluttered. "We'll bÂ«
eating smoke here before long."
The scuttle was a red square of light
above them, and they could see each
other's faces aa pale blurs of no recog
nizable feature in the darkness. They
stripped off their upper clothing, and
bound themselves under their arms to
the ladder.
They could hear the crackle and roar
of flames outside. There was a peeking;
of scattered rain on the tin above
them.
"I wish I had somethin' t* eat," Gor
man said.
Hanrahan sighed again. "I'd like
something to breathe better."
He was choking with heat and
smoke. Ha rested his chin on the runs
of the ladder. He was tired and dizzy.
He seemed to be drifting on clouds of
smoke, blown about in storm and heat,
a glowing spark above the flames. His
mind wandered In a delirium of suffo
cation. He heard Gorman's voice, at a
great distance, say. "Wind changedâ
south."
Daybreak found the "fireproof"
Mansard building a smoking and
blackened shell above Its tenth story,
with the firemen putting out th
smolder in the gutted rooms. They
fought their way up slowly from floor
to floor, until by noon Captain Ball
and a squad of his company, looking
for their dead, reached the stairs lead
ing to the roof.
They found there the blackened
nozzle which Gorman had abandoned
to the fire. They went up the st.tirs
hopelessly and burst open the door to
see Gorman himself â red-eyÂ°d an 4
dripping and stripped to the waist â -
sitting on the edge of the tank, beat
ing with his heels on tts sides and
singing crazy nothings In the voice of
Insanity.
Captain Ball went over to him and
called up. 'Where's Hanrahan?"
He winked and pointed down into
the tank. "I'm the king of the cas
tle," he sang. "I'm the king of the
castle. I'm the king â what' 3 Hanra

he's a spellbinder." he said with a.
grin. "He's a spellbinder, talkin" hot

up. It ain't as hot up here as it waa."
And they found Hanrahan. uncon
scious but alive, still tied to the
der and floating with his head between
the rungs.
Two weeks later, when Gorman re
ported for duty at the engine-house,
his first question was for "Delicate
Pete." "Him?" the lieutenant said.
"Oh, he's quit the department. He'Â«
goin' to Join the police."
Copyright by S. S. McChrre Co.â¢^â f MUCHLY traveled Londoner,
f I lately visiting San Francisco, told
[~H the writer the other day that he
I Â«aw as smartly turned out car
* riages in this city as he has ob
served anywhere in the world. This
bit of flattery, however, was laid on
with rather a thick brush. It was well
that he did not say as many smartly
turned out carriag-es, for that would
have rendered his dictum of no value
whatever. It is true, we have a few
residents of wealth who have fine turn
outs, with servants in liveries, but they
are the rare instances. When any of
these appear in the streets, in the shop
ping districts, or even in the park, they
a. c sure to attract a crowd of curious
observers, the result of their rarity.
Take Central Park, New York, at about
6 o'clock in the afternoon, when all tne
smart people are driving â the display of
luxury in equipage and equipment is
something enormous, but no one ap
pears to notice anything unusual about
It. It is attractive, too, for nothing
looks better than a smart carriage with
correctly liveried coachman and foot
man on the box. the exquisitely gowned
occupants resting in luxurious ease
upon the cushions. To Bee the hand
somest eqjiipages one must go to New
York or abroad, to London, Paris, Ber
lin, Vienna or St. Petersburg. This Is
not saying that San Francisco is so
very far behind the times in carriage
matters. We have some fine turnouts
here, but they are not in the majorityâ
that Is all.
It was M. Theodore Kearney of Fres
no, who is now automobiling in Europe,
who claims the distinction of having in
troduced liveried turnouts in San Fran
cisco. In an article in a Fresno paper
last year Mr. Kearney said: "Some
twelve years ago I brought to San
Francisco a tandem cart with highly
bred horses and the latest style of har
ness. To have my 'turnout' in entirely
'good form' I had my coachman In
proper livery sitting up in the cart be
hind me. This was at the time the
'correct thing' in our Eastern cities, as
well as abroad, but for a long time I
was met with hooting and Jeers every
day from our free American citizens as
I drove out to Golden Gate Park. I am
not without some moral courage, and
knowing that I was right I 'stayed
with it," and I have the satisfaction of
seeing in San Francisco many well ap
pointed carriages with coachmen and
grooms properly equipped." Though
Mr. Kearney claims the honor of intro
flucing livened rigs in bur city, possi
bly the Selbys, Athertons. the late
George Gordon, the Parrotts, McAllis
ters and Newhalls might all dispute
hie claim were they disposed to do so.
The George Newhalls could easily claim
that they pioneered the custom of
wringing a liveried carriage Into the
flowntown district, for Mr. Newhall is
the only business man who drives home
In that degree of state.
Many wealthy San Franciscans con
sider any approach to a livery in their
servants' attire beneath the dignity of
c patriotic American. What they
â¢*ould not wear themselves they will
not compel their servants to wear.
Ptill there are others, quite as good
Americans, too, in thought, word and
deed, who believe strongly in liveries
and their right to dress their servants
j\ them. Frank Carolan has quite a
;rowd of servants at his Burlingame
home, always correctly liveried. All of
George Pope's men are well liveried.
George Newhall believes in liveries and
has his servants thus uniformed. That
there are seen liveries in this part of
the world of every cut and color is not
due to the absence of a standard, but
that the standard Is not recognised.
Perhaps, and this Is more to tbe point.
THE LADY AND HER CARRIAGE
the' standard is not understood. The
principles of liberty, equality, and fra
ternity, following closely upon the
heels of the good old customs ofÂ« Co
lonial days, were not conducive either
to elegance or neatness, but rather to
a forgetfulness of anything savoring
of form. Livery, though dating from
the days when the family retainers
were dressed for battlefield or crusade
in the distinctive livery of their feudal
lord, is still to mafty a new and un
trodden field. The question of livery
is a sensitive matter to touch upon in
a republic at any time. Liveries are a
badge of servitude, though to look
upon them in the rl&'ht spirit they are
no more that than is the uniform of a
soldier, or sailor, or trained nurse.
Perhaps in another year or so liv
eried servants will be the general rule,
such as the whitecapped and aproned
bonne has become. Time was when the
average maid-servant refused with
indignation to don a cap, and when she
did agree to wear one had to be ap
peased for the loss of her dignity with
a few dollars added to her wage. How
ever, she long ago got over her indig
nation and it is only In homes where
the laundry bill is a consideration that
maids now bo uncapped.
At the outset one must confess that
London is the fountain head from
which New York, and. In turn, the less
er cities, draw thoir knowledge of what
Is correct in livery. In the realm of
wiy, London is more than dictator.
She is the father and mother to the
child "Good Form" â a somewhat neg
lected infant in this country of ours.
The laws of livery are as the laws of
the Medes and Persians. Absolute cor
rectness even in the smallest details
is essential, for it is this correctness
which stamps the service of a well
regulated establishment with the hall
mark of good form. It is necessary to
remember that men servants in an
English house are either what our
British cousin calls "In" or "out" of
livery. Speaking of indoor servants,
the butler is "out of livery," 1. c., he
wears plain clothes and never appears
In a dress coat until It Is the hour for
dinner. Footmen, on the contrary, wear
their livery all the time. Of the out-of
door servants, the gardener is never in
livery, but the coachman and footmen
are. The correct dressing of servants
is a matter that is given great atten
tion In the older countries, and which
is gradually being observed by a num
ber of our best families In this city
that keep up large establishments. In
England It 1* frequently said that the

if the cost of his clothea

Take an outfit for a

These will cost consid

and grooms, who are.
out of doors a great
deal, are made of the
finest and most expen
sive materials. One has
known many instances'
where the monogram or
crest buttons alone for
certain family servants
cost over $100. The fam
ily crest or monogram
is always stamped on
the buttons worn by
coachmen, footmen,.
grooms, etc. Servants
in England are always
dressed in the special color of cloth
adopted by the family, and known to
the tailor as that family's color. This
fashion Is imitated by Americans.
Among San Franciscans one can point
to the following distinctive colors worn
by tho liveried servants of our rich:
Mrs. Frank Cardan's men wear black;
Mrs. George Pope's, blue; Mrs. E F
Pope's, light green; Mrs. Will Crock
er's, maroon; Mrs. "Joe" Tobin's, ma
roon; the Henry Crockers', dark green;
Mrs. W. G. Irwin's, black. John Par
rott's servants wear a livery of black
with black and red waistcoat. Mr.
Parrott, by thÂ« way, was the first man
In California to garb his household
servants In livery. The Walter Ho
barts used. In the days of their great
est prosperity, to dress their servants
in plain black, their livery being neat
but not conspicuous.
To thÂ« unlearned in livery lore who
aims to let up an establishment of
livwied servants. thÂ« following hint!
may be of use. They came to the
writer direct from a New York au
thority on everything there is to be
known regarding- liveries. And what a
dreadful thing it would be if there
should be anything wrong about the
get-up of Thomas or James or John.
Fancy what a shame Thomas would
feel if his greatcoat were cut one Inch
too long! Imagine what would be the
bitter degradation of James in his own
eyes and those of his fellows if his
master required him to wear a high
hat in the country when a low square
one is called for by the oracle of good
form! Why, it would be much worse
a solecism to Thomas or James to be
Incorrectly garbed than it would be for
their respective masters to appear in
a tall hat with a short coat, or vloa
versa. The gentlemun, If he were as
sured of his social position, might
make tall hats with short coats tho
fashion, but the tailors make the styles
for Thomas and James, and custom Id
tnelr case cannot be overnaaen oy ca
price.
A coachman's coat should be some
what longer than a groom's. It should
have. In addition, flap pockets, which
are never seen on a groom's coat. There
should be six buttons in front, and two
near the bottom of the skirt. The mid
dle buttons are omitted, so as not to
wear the box seat. The groom's coat,
au contraire, has the full six buttons
behind, and six in front; he. not the
coachman, leaves his seat wheu such
service is called for. The buttons
should by no means match the har
ness's metal trimmings except when the
family is In mourning and black is a
necessity. Velvet collars are a matter
of taste. A valentian sham wa'stcoat
must always be worn. Accordion-like
boots are incorrect, for they do not
retain their proper position; stiff -legged
calfskin with russet or white tops,
black If In mourning, are correct.
Breeches of wh'te stockinet, with the
upper button just below the kneecap,
are good form. Trousers can be worn,
but are not nearly so smart in ap
pearance as breeches. A white linen
scarf and regulation "coachman" col
lar, with silk hat, flnisn the general
equipment. If an Anglomaniac wishes
to be right up to the English standard,
he will have his liveries as plain and
simple as possible. Dark blue is pref
erable to the lighter and brighter
shades. Bright buttons should not be
worr in profusion, and unless a crest,
nothing should go on these buttons.
No bands should be worn around the
hats, if strict good form is the ob
ject. Silver is in execrab'e taste and
velvet, in England at least, stamps the
master of the liveried servants as "im
pcsssible." Cockades, in America, the
best authorities say, should not be
worn at all. A little while ago there
was considerable discussion in the pa
pers as to whether President Roose
velt's servants should wear cockades.
Some self-constituted crlterlons say
that members of the army, navy and
diplomatic corps have the right to put
cockades on their servants' hats, but
the best advice on this subject is the
Immortal Punch's â Don't. In England
army officers, present and retired, dep
uty lieutenants of counties, high
sheriffs, and other like officials may
spc-rt the cockade on their liveried
sarvants, but no one else would even
think of doing such a thing. The royal
family has a cockade of its own, a
round leather rosette, without any fan
at the top like the common cockade.
A coachman's greatcoat or overcoat,
when worn with boots and breeches.
must come a bit below his boot tops;
the groom's, to the top button oÂ£ n.is
breeches. "When trousers are worn,
the coats are longer. Gloves are usu
ally tan, but sometime* of white buck
skin.
The coachman's and groom's "undress"
llvery is whipcord, a brown square hat
to be worn with the jacket; a s-juare
or coaching hat with the coat. In w-it
weather the carriage servants mu3t
have mackintoshes, rubber hat-covers
and knitted gloves, a large umbrella to
be carried for the footman's use wheit
going between carriage and ho us*
doors.
The butler's morning dress includes
a plain black Jacket or coat, and
squeakless shoes of any kind of
leather. The second man wears Urn
same unless when he Is waiting, when
a Tuxedo is proper. In private services,
duck or thin coats are not to be worn.
Only at dinner need the butler don his
white gloves. At dinner the house
footman wears a dress coat of the
"family color." His waistcoat is of
striped or solid color valentian or
plush, trousers like the coat piped to
match the waistcoat. Jeems must al
ways wear a white collar and tie, and
noiseless shoes. It would be a direful
day for Jeems If his shoes emitted evÂ«n
the faintest kind of a squeak. â²
broken dish could not be- a much
greater calamity to him,
The hall boy or page wean trousers
and short jacket of the family color,
with plenty of buttons. The "boy la
buttons" is a familiar character abroad
and we had him on the stag* in nat
ural guise in that pretty play "The
Rajah," which Marie Burroughs pre
sented at the dear departed Baldwin
many years ago. Little George Bruen
lng sustained with fidelity the part of
the muchly buttoned boy. Our eleva
tor boys and the bellboys at our best
hotels wear a uniform approximating
that of the European hal'.boy, but he
Is not so lavishly supplied with but
tons. The West Point cadets come the
nearest in attire to the boy In but
tons as he Is seen In Europe.
Certain private establishments with
more than the average regard for form
and European precedent uniform their
house footmen in what is termed a
court coat, a garment of peculiar cut,
suitable to be worn with knee breeches
and buckles, a plush waistcoat, low
buckled shoes, and black stockings.
Club servants dress much as do house
footmen. The liveries in San Francis
co's clubs are about the same in style,
nothing distinctive. The men as a
rule wear uniform coats and plain
trousers. One does not see In the
West, or Indeed In the East very often,
any of those remarkable footmen w*
get on the stage, those huge giants
with bulging, white-stockinged calvet
that we read of in English novels.

had returned from Washington.
Those who openly had indorsed
- his candidacy and who secretly
had voted against him felt free
to call upon him and to question him
concerning the affairs of state. The
Congressman, the Honorable Mr. Jim
Horn Adams, welcomed his friends.
It was the part of his wife to inquire
of each man, "Oh. why didn't you
bring your wife?" And she did it well
âjust as If she meant It.

Honorable Jim Horn Adams, taking
â¢ seme papers out of one pocket and put
ting them into another. "And by the

"Haven't seen a seed," said the old
man.
"Why, that's singular. I sent you a

Adams continued, pleased at his own
invention and the lucky chance of old
Urn* Indorsement of It. "Homer,
that's the man."
"Did you make him an offer?"
"Well, no. The fact Is, I was very
busy at the time, having been sum
tnonÂ«d to meet the Committee on Ways
and Means, and hadn't the opportunity,
but I shall, as soon a I return."
"You are certain It was Homer?"
"Oh, yes, quite certain."
"Well, now you know that's strange.
There was a fellow along here about
a month ago fr^om Louisiana and we
got to talking about chickens and he
told me that Congressman Homerâ was
it L. B. Homer?"
"L. B. â that's his name. Yes, I rec
ollect perfectly. And I said to myself
âsaid to my wife, 'I'm going to get
that rooster for my old friend.' "
"Well, now," drawled old Lim. "I'm
glad you are sure as to his name. This
fellow told me he reckoned that L. B.
HornÂ«r was the finest judge of a
chicken in all the whole country, and
co I thought I'd write to him. And I
. did. I got me some of the finest paper
"they had at the store and took down
forae polkberry ink I'd made in the

wrote back from Washington that he
never owned, a game rooster in his
life, that he didn't care anything about
'era and that if he had his way he'd
have *eni all killed and stewed up for
a darky picnic. I'm glad you told
me, Mr. Adams, for I'll write to him
again on the commonest sort of paper
â  and tell him what a liar he is."
"Why. I wouldn't do that," pro
tested the Congressman.
"Yes I will. There's nothing that
does me more good than to catch a
representative of the people in a lie.
It is a duty we- owe to the public to
expose such frauds. Sure now his
naitie is Homer, are you?"
"Homer. Now let me see. Mary,"
he added, speaking to his wife, who
sat near him. exhibiting her uneasi
ness, "is that man's name Homer or
Warner?"
"I think it's Warner," she answered.
"I'm Quite certain of it."
"Yes. Warner." said the Congress
man.
"What, B. D. Warner?" Jucklin ex
claimed.
"Well," hesitated the Congressman.
"I'm not sure as to his Initials. But
I don't think, however. It's B. D. I
think they call him Samuel."
"Samuel R.," said his wife.
"What." again exclaimed old Lin,
"it is old Samuel Radner Warner. I
know him like a book. Sorter lame In
the right leg?"
"Not that I noticed," replied the
Congressman. .
"Oh, not at all," spoke up his wife.
"No?" said Llm. "Well, come to
think of It. neither was the one I
know. It's his brother that's lame.

Ideals in Practice
Fables for the FoolisH
IDEALS are good things to have,
even if you never use them.
They're like a dress suit for a $11
a week hall roomer, a badge of
respectability and a very present
help In case of need. It's a peculiar
thing about Ideals that they are al
ways turning up In unexpected places.
For example, you may find a black
smith who yearns with a mighty yearn
to write poetry. At times lam tempt
ed to believe that almost all the poets
of these degenerate days are black
smiths in disguise â and porly dis
guised at that. The typewriter dreams
of the day when she can marry the
head of the firm and break the speed
ordinances in her own automobile.
The head of the firm has his eye fixed
on the happy time when he can take
a whole week away from the â¢fflce
and eat a square meal without feeling
eorry for It afterward. Even the
criminal rich have their ideals. Not
being in their confidence. I oan't say
what they are, but I'm sure that they
must have them.
Horace Greeley Jones furnishes a
typical example of the difficulty of
living with an ideal regularly. Mr.
Jones' calling and election was the
purveying of news and the guldlnr
and forming of the public mind on all
questions of great general importance.
In other words, he was an editor. I
trust that no one will smile at this
implication that an editor may pos
sess ideals. I have known two or
three who kept a full set â in a safe
deposit vault in their wives' names.
Horace Greeley, however, was one of
the only editors on record who has
attempted to keep an ideal In a gilt
frame on his desk where he could
consult it constantly.
One of his fundamental conceptions
of the business of the newspaper edi
tor was that he should never allow
anything to appear in the columns of
his high class sheet which could pos
sibly offend the most sensitive of his
readers. Murders and lynchings and
ward caucuses must be carefully
avoided and full accounts should be
given of church sociables and the af
ternoon teas of the elite of the com
munity. That was ideal number one.
Ideal number two was that a news
paper should never tell anything but
the truth and when by any chance it
blundered Into a slight misrepresent
ation full apology and explanation
should be made in the next Issue. His
mistake here was in assuming that
while truth may lie at the bottom of
a well. It Is very seldom an ink well
in a newspaper office.
A third ideal to which he clun* with
the tenacity of a Congressman to his
full legal mileage was that a news
paper should never attempt to make
money. The stubbornness of coarser
men who begged to be allowed to live
was an abomination in his sight. He
was of the opinion that making: a liv
ing was a secondary matter. Finally
he thought that an editor should be
without ambitions or friends which
could possibly warp his Judgment. Ed
itors seldom do have any friends and
their ambitions are very soon trimmed
down to an overwhelming desire to get
the forms on the presses in time to
catch the first mall. It will thus be
seen that the only ideal In his whole
outfit to which he could cling with any
prospect of success was the last.
The exact manner In which the oth
ers were one by one consigned to the
darkness of oblivion makes a sad and
almost tragic story, but It is a story
which the Interests of truth compel me
to relate. Not being an editor I can
tell the truth occasionally, for practice
if for no other reason. When he began

"Are you going out, papa?" asks
Miss Fannie.
"Yes, me dear," says Whiskers. "A
man is hired to coma to de club dis
evening: who can put all fifteen pool
balls in de six pockets In one shot.
Dey tell me it Is a most amusing show.
Good-night."
I was getting mixed In me troubles,

"Don't bodder me now," she chips

to put his ideals in operation he com
menced with the one which forbade the
publication of malodorous news. This
would be a first-class Idea If we were
living in a world of perfect human be
ings. But the fact of the matter is
that imperfection is so general as to
be almost a habit with most of us. Mr.
Jones soon saw that his editorial
scheme was so full of blowholes that
It looked more like a slab of armor
plate than an editorial policy. People
turned with a sickening* alacrity from
the account of the Christian Endeavor
convention on the front pass of Jonas'
paper to the rival sheets where they
could find, a description with diagrams
of the murder In Chinatown the nlxht
before. They were more interested in
learning how Kid McCoy led tor the
point of the jaw with his left than la
reading the latest exploits of tbs Car
negie Institution. This is deplorable.
but it Is also human.
Horace Greeley sighed and turned the
face of Ideal number one tÂ» the wsiL
Then he took fresh courage. Surely he
could tell the truth. That small solace
must at least be left to him. But even
this proud distinction was to be denied.
He was destined to discover that peo
ple are not so much Interested In knew-
Ing the truth as they are In reading
a good story. Newspapers would tell
the truth if they could, that is, those
which have not forgotten how, but their
readers wouldn't stand for It. For ex
ample, a young woman elopes with her
father's coachman. No one would care
two cents about It if they were told In
cold-blooded English that she was a
homely, freckle-faced young person
with barely sense enough to hoist an
umbrella when it rain* Truth is usu
ally too matter of fact to be Interesting.
Therefore, the bright young man who
reports the story makes the eloperess
a brilliant beauty with the wit and wis
dom of Minerva, and the personal
charm of Helen of Troy or Mrs. Chad
wick of Cleveland. Then every one In
town buys the paper and talks about
It for at least two hours. News Is like
Thanksgiving turkey, very palatable if
It is properly dressed and attractively
served.
The idea that a newspaper should be
completely Indifferent to the condition
of its balance sheet received a sever*
Jolt Inside of a month after Horac*
Greely donned the editorial toga. la a
scathing editorial he held the lemonade
trust up to public scorn and ridicule.
The next day the business manager
came into the office with wrath in his
eye and a letter in his hand and de
manded to know if Horace Qreeley
were not aware that the lemonade trust
was one of the heaviest advertisers.
Horace Greeley didn't know It and ven
tured the opinion that he didn't a**
how It concerned him. anyway. Then
the manager made answer with blight
ing sarcasm that he supposed the long
eared Individual who wrot* that edito
rial was good for tha payroll Saturday
night. This was a crushing blow for
Horace Greeley. It had not occurred
to him before that he had a very direct
personal Interest in the financial condi
tion of the paper whose office he
graced with his presence.
But why prolong this sordid recital oÂ£
human weakness and error. Tou all
know how It is yourselves. Given a
choice between an Ideal and three
square meals, and. human nature being
what It is, nine hundred and ninety
nine out of every thousand will take
the meals. That was what Horace
Greeley did. To-day, In addition to
writing careful, conservative editorials
which are not calculated to wound the
feelings of the most sensitive "inter
est" In the country, he Is lecturing
semi-occasionally on ideals in Journal-
Ism.
It must not be concluded *rcm these
few brief but burning thoughts that tha
good old maxim "aim high" Is not good
advice; but when it Is necessary to get
meat for dinner a man sometimes has
to shoot at something close to thÂ«

Acting upon this hint, your corre
spondent made a study of their cloth-
Ing and particularly of the hats which
they have had made for the spring and
summer tours. The modistes, to whom
one always owes so much in the way
of kindness lor hints bestowed, assisted
also and the result is that the readers
of this page can have some very good
hints about the fashioning of their
spring hats and gowns from the ward
robes of those who are said to be the
"best dressed women."
In the matter of hats, the news is
particularly interesting. Edna Mays
"best hat,' according to an informant,
Is a very large, pale blue hat of scoop
shape. It has a wide brim, which
flares in front and is slightly depressed
at ear* side, though not sufficiently so
to be . tiled a genuine poke bonnet. It
Is in the very best taste and is of a
style which would be exceedingly be
coming to any blonde young woman.
The pretty feature of the hat is
found in the bunch of loops which
trims the side. Two whole pieces of
narrow blue velvet ribbon, arranged in
loops, hang from the left side of the
hat. The longest loop reaches almost
to the knees. The other loops gradually
grow shorter until there is just one
dainty link- Rt of loops right back of
the left ear. A hat of this kind is
called a casino hat, or a drawing
room hat.
Maxlne Elliott wears a hat which is
called a basket hat. It is flat on top
with the edges slightly raised, some
thing like a great straw tray; and into
the top there are piled flowers of all
Irtadg- It is like a little flower garden
gTowing upon the top of the head, or
like a tray of flowers which one might
Imagine that one were supporting upon
the coiffure. The under B ide is faced
â¢with pink, into which are set numerous
little pink button roses.
Miss Elsie de Wolfe has a large
â wardrobe of hats, most of them of the
English order, small and much trim
med with the nark of elegance upon
them. They are neat little turban
shaped hats, very compact, very ele-
Crant, and very expensive. Most of
them are on the order of what is called
all-the-year-round hats.
Novelties in Easter Hats.
No matter how backward the spring,
the Easter hat comes out brave and
gay. It is the sure landmark by which
one may know that fashion has put
aside her winter garb for the prettier
clothing of a merrier season.
The Easter hats this year show many
novel points. And on* of the most
novel is seen in their diminished size
True, there are big hats, and there are
picture hats, and there are hats that
are big to the point of romanticism
Eut the Easter hat as it will bloom
forth is quite limited as to size and
very much modified as to many other
points.
But do not think that, just b^-ause
hats are small, they are also cheap. On
the contrary, the smaller they grow the
higher they soar in price, and it really
looks as though the tiny hat had com
pressed within its crown and brim all
the expemsiveness which characterized
the great high wide hat with its flaring
leathers.
A hat which was small and could
have been put into a cheese box was
built for a woman who makes It one
of her religious maxims not to wear
cheap millinery. It cost, of a surety, a
1 1 9 and might have been more." ' It
was shaped like a turban, with a rathei
hijrh crown. One side was draped in
spangled cream tulle, which was
laid on in a very thick and very heavy
fold. The other side was trimmed with
gold fringe with paillettes a finger long.
There was the very tiniest facing of
gold lace. .
Another hat which cost a great deal,
but was not very big, was in turban
chap*. This turban was draped with
real lace over gray satin. At one side
there was a large bluish pink rose with
a wonderful pink center, while in the
very heart of the rose there was a
glittering: pin.
And still another turban, remark
able for its elegance, was all black, be
ing a wonderful display of lace and
jets and black tulle and black pail
lettes, with hundreds of spangles glit
tering all over the hat. This was one
of the all-the-year-round hats. And a
very pretty and becoming one at that.
There is undoubtedly a tendency to
get back to the little bonnet with
strings. But it is only the very young
woman who dares wear it. It is im
mensely becoming to the rosy-cheeked,
fresh, young face. But it is not so be
coming to the woman who has passed
beyond the age of natural roses.
Bonnets With Strings.
The Duchess of Manchester, that
popular Western girl, who has set the
example of domestic felicity to the
titled Americans of Europe, wears this
early spring a little black jet bonnet,
shaped like a toque. She went driving
in it the other day 'with Lady Mary-
Montague by her side. At the left
side there were pink roses and buds,
and right under the chin there was
tied a smart pink velvet bow with wide
ends spread out in the prim fashion
which was once the style, but which
one never sees nowadays except on
prim old women from Philadelphia,
Another pretty bonnet worn by the
Duchess is slightly on the poke order.
It is in golden brown, wide in the
brim, trimmed with pink roses and tied
under the chin with three sets of black
velvet ribbons.
Lady Mary Montague's Easter hat is
in blue and it is very large. It is ar
ranged simply, as befits her 3-year-old
dignity. It is a fiat hat, lifted sharply
at one side, where it is caught with a
big soft blue ribbon bow. There are
wide ribbons that tie under the chin.
She is to wear this with a white china
silk coat lined with blue. The coat
Is buttoned down the front with big
white crystal buttons, each one paint
ed with a blue flower. Her shoes and
leggings are white.
The Napoleons are becoming to near
ly all faces and can be worn even by
women of advanced age. They are
positively bewitching upon a young
woman with a tall, graceful figure and
a pretty face. And what Is bet of all
to be claimed in their favor is that
they are not extremely expensive and
can be easily trimmed by one's self at
home or trimmed at small cost by a
milliner.
"This is my last year's Easter hat,"
bragged a very well-dressed youngr
woman. "It had a wide straw brim,
flexible and made of good straw. I
turned it up irregularly around the
crown, and trimmed it in military fash
on. and, behold, I have a spring Na
poleon hat."
One of the most becoming Napoleons
was turned up at the back and under
the brim was set three bunches of
white grapes. Above the grapes there
were clusters of pink roses, large and
closely massed together. This trim
ming,, which was the feature of the hat,
consisted of pink roses, a great many
6mall green leaves and three bunches
of grapes.
How to Trim Your Hat.
The season's millinery has a great
deal in its favor and a great deal
against it. In the latter category can
be mentioned the fact that it is more
difficult to trim one's hats than last
year. Last year's hats were easily
trimmed at home. But this year the
hand of a professional is almost neces
sary.
And hats are dear, too. This year
you must pay a good price where last
year you could get along on $5 and less.
The reason is that the hats are mor>
elaborate. The trimmings cost more.
The articles used upon them are more
expensive and the result is a conse
quent higher figure.
It 16 no uncommon thing to see a
really elegant buckle upon a hat. The
conspicuous position in which the hat
is worn makes one loth to use a cheap
buckle, and so a handsome gold or
sterling silver ornament is used set
with semi-gems, which are, however
almost as dear as the real gems. In
this way one can pay very well for
ones hat buckles without intending to
be extravagant.
Feathers are to be used in the spring
again. And in this connection it can
be said that there is no trimming that
pays better. "I invested $40 in a feather
three years ago." said a woman who
dresses very well, "and I have worn it
winter and summer ever since. The
first year It was a white feather. I had
it dyed a blue, and now it is a golden
brown. This Easter I shall have it ar
ranged as a lyre plume around the
brim of a rough straw hat of moderate
size."
The rough straw hats seem to cry
out for a trimming of ostrich feathers
and particularly are they pretty, early
in the season, when the cold weather
makes them more appropriate than
flowers. If the feather be a heavy one,
well dressed, and of expensive make,
It will keep its shape all through the
mists of summer and will come out
very well in the fall. It is the cheaply
dyed feathers which growÃ lanky in an
hour.
Very many Easter hats are conspicu
ous by their trimming of feathers in
under the brim. Feathers are arranged
in groups and are caught in under the
brim in place of flowers. They make
a dressier trimming, some claim, and
certainly they have the approval of the
fashionable world.
A lovely little bunch of soft short
white tips trimmed the under brim of
a rough satin and chenille straw which
was trimmed on top with a wreath of
roses and many little black velvet
bows.
Another hat which had Its trimming
of ostrich feathers was in rough straw
with the feathers as short as tips.
They were massed to fall upon the
back hair. Ribbon loops were mixed
through them with a skill which be
spoke the professional.
The Ready-to-Wear Hat.
The ready-to-wear hat has been pro
moted from its lowly position In the
wardrobe to one of high dignity. It is
now a hat which is elegantly selected
and tastefully trimmed. Indeed, it is
â¢possible to so select one's ready-to
wear hats that they may supply every
need of one's wardrobe. They are
made of various materials and they
are trimmed in smart ways. It comes
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
LATEST
TIDINGS
OF THE
EASTER
HAT
In the elegant little English 'styles as
well as In the medium sizes and is even
to be found in the picture hats.
The only drawback to the ready-to
wear hat is that it is made by the
quantity for all to wear. It is a hat
of which one is never sure of secur
ing an exclusive shape. On the con
trary one gets a hat which can be seen
upon every corner. And to many per
sons this is not a pleasant thought.
One wants something more exclusively
one's own style.
To obviate the very disagreeable
commonness of the ready-to-wear hat
a milliner makes this suggestion:
Take a large brimmed hat of rough
straw which lies upon the ready-to
wear counter. You will find it faced
with straw of another kind, while
around the top there is a neat ar
rangement of maline and straw, with
a handsome straw bow. perhaps, or a
straw buckle or perhaps a feather or
nament.
Take a hat of this description and
finish it yourself. On the under side
of the brim, at the right, place a big
satin bow. Let it be large and well
made and considerably flattened out.
Now, if you please, set a bandeau un
derneath the hat. And upon this
bandeau arrange a little wreath of
tiny pink roses or small white ones,
or even of black flowers, if you find
them more becoming. As for the top
of the hat it needs nothing except a
very tiny wreath of flowers around
the brim, put around in such a way
that the vine falls off the back of the
hat.
Little improvements can be easily
made in the ready-to-wear hats and
they transform them from the every
day variety into handsome pieces of
millinery that rival the exclusive
French models.
The French Easter hats, by the way,
partake a little of the nature of the
bizarre. . In order to wear them one
must have three things â a long purse,
ii large wardrobe and the courage of
one's taste.
They are large arid thtir price is in
exact proportion to their size. One
shows a perfectly immense picture hat
with a great flaring front, wide
enough to shelter three faces instead
of one face, which looks quite dimin
utive under so bisf a hat. It is faced
with hand embroidered tulle, which
is chirred, while in the shirring are
set rows and rows of small roses.
The top of the hat is a flower gar
den running down to a point at the
back, where it is met by a great
crushed pink ribbon bow, which forms
streamers, which come forward and
are looped under the left ear.
The French Picture Hat.
And there are French picture hats
which are called Louis XIV hats, and
which, for women who want the im
mense picture hat. are ideal. There
is one in particular which is lovely.
Just picture to yourself a Gainsbor
ough hat. But it is different from the
Gainsborough, for the side is turned
up higher and much more sharply.
And instead of a feather there are
roses. This hat, which is trimmed
with a great deal of velvet ribbon,
can only be worn by a woman of some
style. It takes style to wear a hat
that Is turned up sharply at one side
and caught with a great rose and its
leaves, and with nothing else to soften
its outlines.
And still other picture hats have
appeared and of the galaxy â for there
is a great array â there is nothing quite
an decorative as the garden hat. It is
large and flat and beautifully trimmed,
and Maude herself could not have
"come into the garden" In a hat more
suggestive of summer.
The garden picture hat appeals to a
large number of women, for It requires
nothing more than a prety face. And
in these days all women are pretty.
It is built on the order of the old
time garden hats. There is a low
crown, around which a wreath of
leaves may be twined, or a wreath of
rcses. At one side there is a hand
some ribbon and velvet chou and in
the back there is an immense bunch
of loops with two ends, which come
down and are brought front, or can
hang right down the back in streamer
fashion.
Pretty variations of the garden hats
are seen. There is one which is round
and flat, with a low crown. It is
trimmed with a thatch of leaves,
â¢which line it. Arcund the very edge
of the brim there is a wreath of the
littlest roses. A similar wreath goes
around the crown. One side of this
hat is lifted and curved and held in
place by a stiff wire hidden ia the
roses. And right in this curve there
is set a pink rose of lar~e size. This
hat is one of the dressiest of the gar
den hats.
Although roses play a large part in
the Easter millinery, let nouody sup
pose that they are its exclusive trira
ir.ings. All sorts of flowers, real and
imaginary, flowers that grow in the
field and flowers that never grow save
under the nimble fingers of the
flower makers, are seen this year upon
the Easter shapes.
While following the flower thought
one must mention the fact that the
flower turban is once more very popu
lar and is seen very much as it was
some years ago, round and compact
and made almost exclusively of little
flowers.
There is a flower toque, which Is
very popular and which has for Its
basis the beautiful purple violet. It la
made with pointed front and rounding
back. Its style is called the boat
shape, though some call It the tri
ccrne. You will recognize it. Its
front or bow comes almost to a sharp
point, while its sides rise high and its
back is prettily shaped to fit the head.
The Flower Turban Is "In" Again.
For the flower turban one harks back
to the days when every woman had a
violet turban. This turban is rather
large this season. It is pointed in
front and is covered as to the top with
violets, while the sides are thatched
v.ith leaves. This violet and green
together term a very pretty combina
tion which can be made dressier by
the addition of a pink velvet bow, or
a series of little pink velvet bows, ar
ranged around the crown in such â¢
manner that the little bows touch the
hair.
The gown to wear with the flower
toque is unquestionably a gown of the
same color. A pretty purple, a pansy
colored, or a lavender gown goes beau
tifully with a violet-trimmed hat. And
one can even essay to wear pink if one
cares to do so.
A pink cloth street dress Is not such
a great extravagance if one looks at it
rightly and selects the shade of pink
as it should be selected. There are
many colors, all called pink, and one
can have something fashionable or
something bizarre just as one elects.
For street wear or for calling, for,
of course, a pink broadcloth dress ia
not a shopping gown, one should pick
out the deeper tones. There is a pink
which looks a great deal like the lav
ender and whi<h is chosen as a grad
ual way of getting out of mourning.
It is a sort of cross between drab and
lavender and rink, yet it is undenia
bly pink. It comes in lavender, cash
mere, in ladies cloth, in broadcloth, ia
the taffetas and in the new taffeta pop
lin.
Of course, one must pause to say a
word for the poplins. They are so ad
mirable in every way. They make the
smartest and most durable dresses ana
they are In good taste no matter how
worn or when.
A lovely deep pink poplin for Easter
wear has a hat of black chip trimmed
with pink rc-ses. Black gloves and
black boots complete the very neat
dress. And another poplin is in pansy
color made to wear with a toque all
pansies, and a parasol of pansy colored
silk with a pansy handle made to look
like the natural flower. With this
there is a silk petticoat to match and
the smartest little handpalnted fan
which hangs from a silver chain in
which are set little metal panaie*.
it would be an excellent thing If all
women had the time and the attention
to attend to the details of their ward
robes It is certainly the little things
that make the dress this season, and

While speaking of the littles why
not mention the bracelet which must

green gold and it is in little links with

*T ARK ye! In one of your many

*â¢ question. Not your household
linen, but the tiny scraps! and the odds
and czx&e that have collected from time
to time. Once accumulated, take an
inventory una see -whal cam be done
with the miscellaneous bits.
Now jn the first place don't alt
down, fold your hasds and calmly say
you haven't any linen scraps, Â«nd,
is more to the point, don't expect
to hayÂ« any, For. -whether she realizes
it or not, nearly every â woman under
the sun can find a goodly Â»ir^nnnÂ» if
WHAT WOMEN WANT TO KNOW
she will rummage Icing and hard
enough, Nine cut of ten women make
their own linen skirts and shirt waists,
or at least have them made at home,
and the great, irregular pieces that are
left over are just the very ticket.
It certainly Isn't the value of the ma
terial that saves It from the waste
basket, but the many uses to which It
can. be put, for no inhabitant of the
scrap bag Is half as popular. Heavy
linen makes a splendid interlining for
the cuffs to all sorts and descriptions
of shirt waists, for many times can
vas and crinoline are too heavy, but the
linen has just the right body. and when
it is used in wash waists it retains the
starch as nothing else can.
These days of fancy collars and cuffs
stray pieces come in mighty handy, and
the. woman who has been saving can
count herself in clover for once in her
life. For you know there really is noth
ing better, for It is both serviceable
zLnd pretty, and as every possible
weight, from the tiniest handkerchief
to the heaviest weave for punch work
is used, there is neither very much
waste nor very much doubt as to
whether the linen is fit or not.
When your bureau drawer is well
filled turn your attention to the linen
closet and see what is needed in this
line. Perhaps, after all, this is the
most satisfactory use, for every house
hold r.ceds quantities of dainty doilies.
â¢ d there is never a time when there
is hot room for just one more.
It's useless to tell you to cut your
doily according to your material, for
.you really cannot very well do other
wise. But. r.o matter the shape, rest in
peace, for every possible size and de
sign has its use, and it doesn't male?
the least difference whether any two
are alike or noL On a curve always
try to make a round oval one, for cir
cles are not only easier to get out, but
you can always make it larger than if
it were square.
If you want a round doily â¢ take a
plate or a bowl the size you can get out
of your cloth and mark out your circle.
Then take a quarter or a half dollar
and. mark your scallops, being careful
tn place the center or the coin on the
circular line, for in this way you can
raise or lower the money and get any
width scallop you like best.
Of course, if 3'ou possess a regular
pattern, and. by the way, some of them
are . wonderfully, pretty and decidedly
Â«"hea;>. you can transfer the design in
two ways. HoJfl it up to the window
with the linen on top and pencil the
outline cs it shows through, or use Im
pression paper between the linen and
the pattern. This impression paper
really is nothing more or less than
plain, nary carbon paper that is
used m all offices, and, as it is both
easy a. handle and very inexpensive,
I really think it th? best. Be careful
#of It. though, for ft is woefully smeary
stuff, and is never quite as happy as
wh*n It Is covering, everything with
hopeless black daubs.
. Pin the three thicknesses down care
fully and then keep your hands strictly
off the pattern. To trace use a sharp
pencil or a piece of blunt metal, for
anything with a very sharp point will
cut the pattern and ruin it for future
use. Then comes the finishing, end this
Is "fully, two-thirds of. the work. Fringe
Ib easy to do. but It is rarely satisfac
tory, and snarls and puckers in the
"laundry, and you will find to your sor
row that it will keep you busy smooth
ing it out, bo. that it will make even a
fair appearance. I
If you don't want to bother with a
more elaborate finish, draw a second
circle about an Inch from the edge of
the doily, and with the machine at low
tension stitch this inner circle and
fringe. If you possess many pieces fin
ished in this fashion the best thing for
you to do is to buy a stiff wire brush
that comes for this very purpose, and
In this way you will save yourself a deal
of labor. Iron the doily and then brush
out the matted fringe and put it away
In a box kept for this sort of thing.
The other finish is button-holing.
Don't throw up your hands in holy
horror, and say you ; haven't the time to
â¢waste In such ' foolishness,' for it really
isn't so bad after you once get into the
way of doing it. Instead of working
at it morning, noon and night, ,as
though your very life depended upon it,
keep it for pick-up work, and see how
quick It goes. By the : way, never
button in anything but soft white
embroidery cotton, -for; even the best
of silk win tarn yellow with age, and it
doesn't wear. half as well, either. â¢
' Square and â¢ oblong: mats : : are useful '
and pretty, too, and certainly they are
easier to fashion. To get it true, pull
a thread or two and use that as a guide
In cutting. If you have enough ma
terial hemstitch a hem. for the flat fin
ish Is always pretty and neat, and it
is absolutely no trouble at all. Don't
make the mistake that so many people
blunder into in doing drawn work.
Draw just as few threads as you can
get along with, for there is no gain
saying the fact that all the strain in
ribboning falls on this weak part, and
it isn't long before a thread gives here
and there and causes a decided wreck
in little or no time.
There Isn't a housewife in the land
who doesn't care for linen, and a
dozen little doilies of this sort is a
mighty nice gift and one that will
gladden her heart as well.
If you vant to be more pretentious,
fashion a large center piece, and make
the smaller ones to match. Instead of
button-holing the edges, trim them
v.ith a heavy Cluny lace and see how
pleased she will be. I think this holds
especially good since table cloths have
been relegated to the chests for
luncheon and after-theater suppers, for
the lace shows up on the polished table
as it does on nothing else.
The plain bits of linen are nearly
always relieved by a monogram or a
single initial, but this isn't a bugbear
by any manner of means, and the
woman who "doesn't sew a single
stitch " can mark every piece of linen
the house affords and not half try,
either. First and foremost lay in a
good supply of paper initials, which
come to tack on and work over and
over. The paper supplies the neces
sary padding and saves a deal of labor,
for "nlling" v.ith cotton takes fully as
long as the embroidering itself.
More and more are the Americans
adopting the French custom of keeping
everything strictly personal and quiet
as different from their neighbors as it
can possibly be. What every one wants
is to be considered individual, and cer
tainly to be this you must be original
and design your own styles, both in re
gard to personal garb and household
goods.
It is said that no French woman per
mits a label to remain on any of her
belongings, no matter what it may be.
If by any hook or crook there chances
to be one it is instantly ripped off and
promptly destroyed, so that madam's
friends may not know who fashioned
it and be able to present a duplicate, to
the everlasting chagrin of the exclu
sive Parlsienne.
Bo feel that way about all the queer
little Jinen pieces that you make. No
matter how odd and quaint it may be,
take comfort in the idea that no one
else will have one Just like it, and that
it is worth two of the commonplace
which line the windows of every shop
In town.
Once get the name for being origi
nal and you have attained something
which every one, young and old alike,
are striving for. And as long as you
must make a beginning, why not start
your Ingenuity to work on the linen
and see how quickly you can devise a
dozen or more ways to suit your own
peculiar requirements.

Correspondents
AMBITIOUS (Private Secretary) â
You have asked me a very difficult
question to answer, for circumstances
make all the difference in the world.
Many people want some one who can
read well, nlay the piano or sing a lit
tle and make themselves generally in
teresting. Again, you might be re
quired to write letters, attend to the
luggage when traveling, attend to the
hotel bills and make yourself generally
useful. Tour salary would all depend.
Now and then one hears of a compan
ion who receives a salary of $50 a week
and all traveling expenses, but this is
most unusual. Again, a salary of $35
or $50, with expenses, 1b paid, and now
and then ail clothes and expenses paid
for and a few dollars for pin money.
Yes, you may please yourself about
dress unless it is otherwise specified,
but I do not think any paid companion
should drees as v.ell as the lady her
self. Dress daintily and prettily so that
you may be attractive, but try to dress
in taste at the same time.
FEEDING THE BABY (Mrs. F. E.
S>â lrregular and overfeeding of a
very young child cannot be too strong-
MADGE MOORE

ly condemned, for they lead to all
manner of trouble, if the child is not
killed outright by these methods of
feeding the foundation for years of in
validism is likely to be laid. Have reg
ular hours for feeding and never de
viate from them unless the child is
asleep. Pure milk should constitute
the main part of the diet for a year-old
child, together with plenty of graham
bread. Carefully toasted white bread,
boiled rice, poached eggs, chicken and
mutton broth with all fat re
moved and well cooked cereals
served -without sugar will fur
nish sufficient variety for the third six
months of the child's life. Raw fruits,
vegetables and tastes from the table
should be forbidden, and especially so
during the summer. Should the child
fret between meals do not give him
milk (this is a food) but a drink of cool
water, though never Iced. Little chil
dren suffer from thirst and are given
food too often when only water is nec
essary.
SOAP TOOTH POWDERS (Mary).â
You are quite cdrrect in believing a
soapy tooth wash superior to the ordi
nary sort 3; it is very cleaning, an es
sential quality, and the distasteful
Boaplness may be overcome by au ad
mixture of orris root, which also im
parts a delicate fragrance to the
breath. It is more economical to buy
the ingredients lb bulk and mix them
at home than to buy a prepared article.
Buy a cake of pure white cttsttle soap
and shave off two ounces of it, which
reduce to a fine powder. In placÂ» of a
mortar for powdering the soap, use a
heavy wooden vegetable masher and an
earthenware bowl. Mix with the pow
dered soap two ounces of Florentine
orris root and one-half pound M pre
cipitated chalk. Pass the mixture
through a fine sieve several times to
thoroughly blend the ingredients, then
put away in a dry place, preferably in
a gl^.3 tlÂ« sely corked. The quantity
naried will be sufficient for a year's
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALIi
use. As the nerves of your teeth are
very sensitive to heat and cold, be par
ticular to always use tepid water when
rinsing the mouth and always use a
pliable bruah. Spools of dental floss
may be obtained at any drug store and
you will find it invaluable in removing
particles from between the teeth.
A CREAM FOR GENERAL USE
(E. B. D.).â After exposure to the hot
sun you will find cream of almonds
mosf beneficial, as it will not only
soothe the irritation, but Impart a de
lightful softness to the parched skin.
You may purchase the prepared cream
at any first-class dealer in toilet ar
ticles, or, if desired, you can make It
yourself. I give an excellent receipt
which, If carefully followed, will give
a very dainty compound. When pre
paring the cream use new vessels of
agate or tin in which to melt the wax,
as a dish used for other purposes ia
apt to Impart a taint to the delicate
ingredients. Take one ounce each of
white wax and spermaceti, five ounces
of oil of almonds and two ounces of
rose water. Cut the wax and sper
maceti in small pieces, place in a small
agate pan. set In another vessel filled
with boiling water, and when the in
gredients are melted beat in the oil of
almonds and lastly the rose water,
boating constantly until all are thor
oughly Incorporated and the whole
forms a creamy white mash. Pour
into a wide neck jar, and when per
fectly cold cover the top with oiled
paper. It Is never wise to dip out of a
large jar daily, as mcjre or less im
vurities are sure to get into the cream.
Keep a small jar filled with a week's
supply on the toilet table, then the
contents of the large jar can be kept
pure to the very last.
TO DRESS A SHORT NECK (For
ty).âln dressing a short neck the first
point to baar in mind is that it is quits
useless to try and endure high, stiff
collars: they only nfkke the wearer
miserable, accentuate the natural de
fect and force a double chin, which In
Itself Is far from desirable. Be sensi
ble and make tre best of the situation
by artistically dressing the neck. To
know the limitations of a collar and to
keep all neckwear comfortable, try on
collars of different heights and shapes
over the neckband of a well-fitting
shirt waist, and use the one which
seems most comfortable as a guide for
future wear. Make a careful note of
the exact heifth* in front and In back,
also its length arouud. and insist that
your dressmaker conform strictly to
the measurements you give her when
making similar collars. A difference
in cut wilt make a vast difference in
comfort and style, then, of course,
measurements change. For example,
the ordinary standing collar cut on
rather straight lines is not for the
short neck unless cut quite low, when
it loses all style. On the other hand,
the standing collar which is quite deep
ly curved directly in front, is most
agret-able, giving perfect freedom un
der the chin. Soft folds, fagoting,
lace, etc., daintily boned or mounted
over the regular skeleton shapes, have
superseded the stiff forms interlined
with canvas. Fasten the collar in
visibly and if a bow or the favorite
chou is used, make it rather fiat. Avoid
all full effects and when band and bows
are worn make them of soft gauze or
liberty satin ribbon, or tulle. Stocks
with deeply pointed, slender tabs in
frc-nt are always becoming.
TREATING STUBBORN HAIR (El-
S j e ), _ Brushing, shampooing, etc.,
which are such important elements in
good grooming will improve even seem
ingly hopeless locks, while systematic
training will, after a time, make the
most obstinate hair He in tlte desired
direction. Becai-" the hair has been
somewhat neglected in this respect in
the past, do not work on the principle
that if a certain amount of care. is ben
eficial, a ?Â«od deal will do wonders;
hÂ«sroic measures almost always prove
disastrous. Coax but do not force
matters, as too frequent brushing and
other manipulations of the hair irri
tate the scaip and cause the hair to
fall out. Hair which is scrupulously
clean but very stubborn in its habit
of growth needs training inste;*
shampooing, a common error in this day
of good grooming. Cloae observation
will soon teach one the difference be
tween fluffy hair and that which is ex
tremely dry. Never under any cir
cumstances allow the hair to remain at
night In the coll ur plaits worn dur
ing the day, for injury is donÂ© the
â  scalp,- and ; the halt soon assumes awk
ward lines, from the hours of pressure
in the wrong direction. Before retiring
brush the hair thoroughly and confine
It In one or two very loose plaits. This
will ; Insure a free circulation of air
through the hair and relax the delicate
'muscles of the scarp which are : more or
less irritated by. the pressure"* of nu
merous pins and the weight of the hair
confined largely at one point. To assist
in the training moisten the hair with
a little good tonic, such as a prepara
tion of quinine and bay rum, containing
Va . small ? per cent â¢of ' oil, and , brush ' in

IMPROVING HOLLOW CHEEKS
(Dorothy).â There are, manifold rea
sons for hollow cheeks. The mat" ones
are- a natural disposition toward bodily
thinness, which manifests Itself plainly
in the face. Weak, undeveloped mus
cles, due to defective nutrition, aa the
result of Impair- 1 circulation and gen
eral physical weakness. Lack of teeth,
which take away the natural support
and allow the cheeks to sink Inward
even though they bÂ« quite fleshy. In
such cases the missing teeth should
be replaced, if possible, for the sake
of proper mastication as well aa for
good appearance; then the labor of
restoring the contour of the face will
be quite easy, provided, of course, the
health is good. To Impart firmness,
facial gymnastics and massage, accom
panied by a good prepared skin food
or cocoa butter, will prove beneficial.
The skin food Is to be applied Just be
fore retiring and the exercise to be In
dulged in both night and morning for
about ten minutes. To exercise the
muscles, first compress the lips, fill the
cheeks v.ith air and work the Jaws in
a chewing movement, puffing the
cheeks outward as much as possible
and keeping the mouth closed. Before
applying the skin food prepare the face
to receive it by a thorough washing In
warm, soapy water, followed by a cold
rinse. Dry, and with the tips of the
fingers stroke the muscles of the
cheeks upward and backward with
gentle pressure, after placing the
thumbs at the base of the ears. Anoint
the hollows with the cocoa butter and
execute a rotary movement, beginning
by placing the finger tips at the cor
ner of the mouth and following the*
Jaw bone to the temple. Start again at
corner of mouth and work upward
through middle of cheek to outer cor
ner of the eye. Repeat each movement
ten times, keeping the pressure firm but
gentle.

GREAT BRITAIN SCORED FOR POLICY IN THE PACIFIC
KING EDWARD CAUSES QUARREL IN THE
ENGLISH ROYAL FAMILY
Princess of Wales Revolts Against Order Which
Entails Visit to India.
DON. March â There is a ter
rible .quarrel in the royal family here
over the Indian tour of the Prince and
Princess of "Wales. The Prince, who
obeys his father implicitly in every
thing, received his orders with due sub
mission. But it was otherwise with the
Princess.
She has been seething with revolt
ever since the King's accession, as she
feels she and her husband are thrown
â¢ entirely into the background by the
dominating: personality of the King.
They get nothing but second-rate func
tions to discharge, such as the opening
of free libraries, cattle shows and cor
poration ceremoniais.
The Princess is a woman of brains,
and ambitious to play a big part, but
the declares the policy of the King is
resulting in the existence of her hus
bar.d and herself being almost forgot
ten. There is a good deal of truth in
this view.
She dislikes going to India, for she is
a wretched sailor. She dislikes also
leaving her children, and her long ab
cer.ee will increase the indifference of
the people toward her.
HAXDSOFP FOR CURZON.
â¢ Then the order that no presents be
exchanged with native rulers adds in
jury to insult. "When the King as
Prince of Wales -went 'to India he col
lected magnificent offerings from the
rajahs, giving them, as is customary,
a trifling return in the shape of guns,
cwords, etc.
But Lord Curzon is going on his fare

next year, when it will be usual ; for

j them to testify their admiration for the
retiring: viceroy by giving him valua
bles of various kinds.
This is a recognized perquisite . of
viceroyalty and it has been pointed
I out to the Kins that if the Prince and
| Princess of Wales accepted presents
! this fall they would take the cream of
! the pot and only skimmed milk would
be left for Curzon next year.
Queen Alexandra is devoted to the
; Wales ' family, but the Princess 'of
; Wales undoubtedly :is jealous of the"
| Queen's extreme popularity, which she
â  never can hope to rival.
, Then it is quite certain that the
Princess knows thÂ«Â» general feeling in
: England, where: she is not popular.. is i
due in a measure to sympathy for the
Prince on account of his other wife
and children in Malta.
All - the world ; knows that he ' loved :
Miss Seymour with devotion and that !
he would have proclaimed her his wife ;
openly had it not been for Queen Vic
toria, and that his marriage with
Princess May was extremely, distaste- ;
ful to. him and was virtually, 1 forced j
upon him by the late Queen.

ritting habitation for the ducal fam
ily will necessitate a considerable ad
ditional expenditure of the Vanderbilt

PREMIER SEDDON
OF NEW ZEALAND
USES SHARP WORDS
Says That Valuable Islands
Have Been Neglected
by Government.
RARE OPPORTUNITIES ARE LOST
Special Cable to The Call.
! AUCKLAND. New Zealand. March 25.
| Premier R. J. Seddon is the â¢ un
j crowned king" of New Zealand and
! considered the greatest man to-day un
! der the Southern Cross.
Concerning the South Sea Islands the
Premier had a good deal to say in a
recent interview. England, he thinks.
| knows little about the South Sea Isl
ij ands. and gauged by the experience of
: years gone by, cares less.
"The history of the South Sea Isl-
I ands." said the Premier, proves that
I this has ever been so. The prypciple
', has always been followed of allowing
: the best things to drop into the hands
' of other nations out here, and then cry
' ing when it is too iate. Look at New
. Caledonia â an island 300 miles long, and
; one of the richest mineral countries in
| the world. Sir George Grey was agi
tating to have it annexed as far back
as 1553. and was supported by the
! chiefs and inhabitants of the islands:
! but no one listened to him. France.
j Germany and America are all on the
lookout, and never miss an opportunity
of improving their island possessions.
"Take the case of Samoa. In 1885.
â¢ with the consent of the chiefs of the
' Samoan Islands, the New Zealand Gov
! ernment had the steamship Auckland
i ready to proceed to annex the Samoan
Islands. There would have been no
trouble and other nations would have
had n<> srrounds to object. Suddenly a
telegraphic dispatch came from Down-
Ing street, and the annexation was
i stopped. Now Germany has one por-
I tion and America has the other, while
j Great Britain has cleared out and left
I New Zealand to labor under a great
disadvantage for ail time to come. Not
only that â they have secured good har-
bors and a base for future operations,
trade and otherwise.
"America in particular is looking
ahead. First she got a share of Samoa
â one week's journey from our colon
ies â then, second. Honoluluâ a week
from Samoa and one week from
Americaâ a good place for coaling,
apart from the value of the land."
McKIXLEY REJECTS PLAN".
On passing through America in 1897.,
Seddon had a talk with President Mc-
Kinley with respect to the Hawaiian
Islands. This was before annexation.
He proposed a joint protectorate-
Great Britain and America, but Mc-
Kinley did not favor it. He maintain
ed that joint protectorates did not work
well, and instanced the case of Samoa.
John Sherman. Secretary of State, was
opposed to annexation as beina: con
trary to the Monroe doctrine, but Mc-
Kinley favored it. and so America eot
the islands. Seddon said that as a rule
he did not approve of Joint pro
tectorates, but they were a step in the
direction of better things.
"With regard to the New Hebrides."
said the Premier, 'at one time these
islands were held to be within the
boundaries of New Zealand. Instead of
insistence, a passive course was taken.
The result is that the islands are now
under a joint protectorate with France,
and there has been continual trouble.
British settlers, it is alleged, are being
elbowed out. French companies and
French settlers claim to have pur
chased large areas of land from the na
tives. Thece is shortly to be a commis
sion of inquiry to look into these raat
ttrs. but there will always be trouble
under existing conditions.
"Koih nations may do their best and
work together; yet there will be dis
satisfaction, probably resulting in the
end. as was i the case with -Samoa, in
Great Britainâ for the sake of peace
and for . concessions elsewhere â with
drawing its protectorate in favor of
France."
â¢ HAND OF mm SEES".
Seddon had suggested, if it were im
possible for Britain to arrange with
France for English control over the
whole of these islands, that it would
be better for the territory ta be shared,
island by island, between France and
England, and thus ' avoid perpetual
friction. Each country would by this
means know where It was, and the
course would be similar to that taken
in respect to Samoa, when Germany
and America each * retained respective
islands.
Seddon was asked, whether he was
responsible for the recent annexation
to New Zealand of the Cook and cer
tain other islands.
"Why. the opposition say so," said
the. Premier with a twinkle in his eye.
"and sometimes even the opposition is
right. Strategically. Nlue and the Cook
Islands are more important than they
look."
Seddon foresaw the opening of the
Panama canal, and declares that he
does not particularly want to see isl
ands that are on the high road to the
colonies parceled out, here and there,
in exchange, perhaps, to America or
France, a thing always possible unatr
a protectorate. There; is a great deal
of unobtrusive French \ Influence at
work in the Pacific, he statedâ great
deal more than people at home seemed
to have an idea of.:',â *- -
"The recent additions to New Zea
land are commercially worth some
thing, are they not?" : >
"Certainly they are. I can show you
reports that show quite an astonishing
amount of trade between New Zealand
and her islandsâ mostly recent. Both
sides benefit. The islands get a market
for their products and we export our
groods to them."
"What about Tonga ? Is it prosper
ing under the present protectorate ar
rangement T'
"The islands have not progressed as
well as they should, but I think the
hurricanes have done more to keep
them back than King George and bis
Ministers, although more could
been done if European advice ana
trol had been followed. The island*
were never better governed than uader
the late Rev. Shirley Baker."
What about the question of settling
the Cook Islar :
They are capable of plenty of devel
opment, in the hands of a few indus
trious white men. without any injury
to the remnant of the native popula
tion â rather the revere. The English
do not understand, and never did un
derstand, the value of colonixing the
South Sea islands generally. Oth
tions do. I have always *een the im
portance of getting our share of that
part of the world, but it would take a>
charge of dynamite to introduce the
notion into the heads of the people in
England. One can only hope they will
wake up some day.
"Meantime we must do our duty and
keep looking ahead, and prepare for
eventualities which are bound to be
come acta en soâ¢* dayâ and
that not far distantâ the importance to
New Zealand and Australia of making

"Cerae In," McAllister pleaded, with

"Come In!" Mr. Worthing scornfully

he repeated: " "Come in.' false friend!

McAllister, "with the man that said
last night that I said that I could
make a better speech than he! And I
can't talk."
"I wonder," I doubted.
"You would if you heard me." Mr.
Worthing warned, leaning ominously
over the table to emphasize the pro
phecy.
"I have much courage." I laughed.
He nodded as he went out, saying:
"It takes more than chloroform!"
"Best fellow that ever was." his
"false friend" told me- "I am so haoDY !

as he and Miss Anglln."
"I think I shall have to ask now for
some of those life secrets." I began.
"Tell me how you happened to desert
the law for the stage."
"Oh. I was always intended for the

"Then it was not a case of being

"No! I went on thÂ«Â» stage at the

CONRIED TO BRING
SPLENDID COMPANY
Here is the pr> arramme of the! opera
season, as outlined by its managers.
Certainly it promises to be the most
brilliant musical event since the Grau
season, and may even conservatively
be expected to surpass that splendid
event.
Fresh from their recent triumphs in
New York and th* brilliant musical
victories which they have just won in
Boston, th* great company of artists
under the direction of Heinrirh
Conried will reach Chicago on Monday
next to begin a brief season of grand
opera at the Auditorium Theater before
departing for Sar. Francisco, where
the season opens at the Grand Opera
house on .April 6. -
Heinrich Conried is himself with
the company superintending the elab
orate productions.
No ' orf nights" have been counted
it: for the San Francisco season. The
orosrammes have been selected with
the utmost car- , the parts in every op
era and music-drama announced have
been distributed weeks in advance, and.
barring accidents, the performances at
the Grand Opera-house promise to Iw
; of the most brilliant and remarkable
i yet seen in this city.
It is a stupendous task and one not
attempted by any of Mr. Conrled's pre
decessors to produce in a season of
twelve performances three so different
n:a?terpieces that will be novelties â
or at least semi-novelties. The presen
tation of "Parsifal" alone would tax
the resources of the most enterprising
i impresario. In addition to "Parsifal,"
However, the success of which seems
already assured by the advance book
ings at the Grand Opera-house, we
shall have that marvel of brilliant
humor "Die Fledermaus" of the "waltz
king. ' Johann Strauss, and a superb
production of Ponchielli's opera "La
Gioconda. A few other trifles, like
the "all-star" performance of "Les
However, it is primarily as a water
colorist that Mr. Latimer has In
trenched himself among the foremost
men of art in San Francisco. In all
California, the home of the redwoods.
I know of no man of the brush with
so intimate a knowledge of the splendid
monarchs of the forest as this same
I-atimer. His knowledge of them is
that which comes of dwelling together
in loving comradeship, of feeling their
moods, their joys and their griefs.
Most ambitious among the canvases
shnvn i? a large oil, "Redwood Soli
tude" â dignified, calm/ reposeful, but to
me less alluring than the little water
color "Early Morning Near Guerne
ville," with its hills veiled in violet haze,
its redwoods freshly green and its
rugged old rail fence, moss-hung. Then
there is the â¢Forest Pool." "Intruding
Sunlight." "A Quiet Nook." "A Shaded
Path." "Early Spring" all exquisitely
treated, and breeding a fierce desire for
the great outside.

As to the company, it will include i
many of the great singers that ap
peared here last season, among them j
Mm-?. Sennbrich, while it will be ;
strengthened _ by the reappearance of i
Mme. Lillian Nordica. a great favorite |
here, and by the first appearance of ;
three new women sing?rs â Olive-
Fremstad, lime. Maria <ie ilacchi and '
Miss Bella Alten.
For the masculine contingent there I
are Mr. Van Rooy. an unrivaled Hans ;

and judge for ourselves Caruso, most >
celebrated :of living tenors.
The mere mention of Caruso's name j
on : the playbills of the cities in which
he has appeared j has sufficed :to draw
crowded and wildly enthusiastic audi
ences. Thousands upon thousands have
shouted I themselves hoarse during the
season at the New York Metropolitan

famous singer. It is piquant to recall !

Although neither a professional

Caruso is said to be a sufficiently well

artist. Adjectives have been exhausted

The Sequoia Club is to be the coziest
householder I know in clubdom.
The eastern half of the Lloyd build-
ing on Sutter street v is being whipped
into shape, and Is now in the hands of
the artists â Mersfelder and a*',
few other clever â who. with the
committee of ladies, are giving it some
mighty pretty touches. The furnish
ing of three of the clubrooms has been
given to the wizard Meyer, the Arts
and Crafts man, who is designing some
Interestingâ and usefulâ things for club
comfort. This duality of beauty and
utility is not such an awful under
taking.
The apartments are to consist of a
reception room, card room, smoking
room (for the men, to be sure), a din
ing room and kitchen, where small
repasts may be prepared and served.
And the distinctive feature of the new
home is that the club shall be open and
ready for business at all times. Good
news!
As for the. established custom of giv
ing receptions to distinguished visitors,
it is proposed to go "on in the same
manner as before â a course much to be
commendedâ when; the visitor is - will
ing, and he usually is. It is this phase
of the Sequoia Club that makes it
stand out above other organizations
in the city â a place where a visitor
i may meet interesting men and women,
and where the latter may mcct 4 each
other. The club hope* to hold its house
warming somewhere between April 1
and 15.
And here's to Its success.

LIFE OF RUSSIAN EDITOR
IS FULL OF THORNS.
Czar Keeps Eagle Eye on Newspapers
ST. PETERSBURG. March IS.â Re- j
cent events have brought Russian jour- *
nals and the men who run them into j
the news with a vengeance. By this â¢
time most American* must have grown |
familiar with the names of the at. J
Petersburg Novoye Vremya. N'ovosti |
and Rubs, the Moscow ' Vledomosti and !
the Kleff Kievlianin, fir since the be- {
ginning of the Far Eastern war there
has been hardly a day when the tele- !
graphic dispatches have not quoted one 5
or another of them. So far the cdi- j
tors of these newspapers have not got !
themselves into trouble- but several !
of their confreres have been less for- ;
tunate.
Among these are Peschechonoff and j
Annensky. Co-editors of the Ruskoye :
Boeatsto: M. Khlshnikoff. editor of j
Our Life, and M. Ganbeiser. editor of Â»
Our Days. They were ; among the }
writers arrested; with Maxim Gorky, j
just after the massacre at the Winter 'â â 
Palace, and r4nt with him to the for- }
tress of Peter and Paul. Quite re- \
cently, too. Prince Mestchersky. who
owns and edits the Grashdanin. was I
summoned to a conference with the f
Czar and M. Pobiedonestsefl. which, .
though ostensibly friendly enough, '
probably wasn't especially pteasanL !
Immediately- after the assassination {
of Grand Duke Sergtus the editors of j
the Liberal newspapers. Xashi.Dni and Â»
Nashaj-Izn, were warned and their {
Journals suppressed for three months. I
GRIM HAM) OF THK TZAR.
The official reason for this step' was 1
the publication in these two St. Pe
tersburg journals of articles which the.
Minister of the Interior regarded as :
revolutionary. In reality their "toni?
was mcÂ»d*rate enough, and th* editor*'
real offense was probably their failure ]
to publish articles on the Grand Duke I
murder, the Journalists having been j
indisposed to discuss the matter with- i
out commenting on the true cause, -j
As. â  matter of fact, the autocracy, j
having decided on reaction, is seizin? j
any convenient pretext to throttle the
progressive press, ;
â  Th (newspapers." said thÂ» Czar to >
Prince Mirsky the other day. "have
assumed * degree of license unknown j
in thÂ» history of Russia." So. , as If ,
censorship that extends even to adver
tisements in their columns were not i
enough, such Journals as dare to speak
their mind or decline to speak- what
is not their mind are to be gagged.
It Is possible that the Government will
be able to silence the voice of public |
opinion in this way. . but already its i
victims are showing fight- j
The Nashi Dni will attempt to re- ;
sume publication "within three. wee!c3 ',
under the name of the:Synotechestoa. i
which the iamc editors and publishers |
began issuing soon after the Zemsi |
Conference and which was suspendeÂ«l i
almost immediately for three months.!
a period now* almost expired. The sit- i
uatlon as between the authorities and !
the newspapers promises to be un- '
commonly interesting-, if it does not â 
become critical, and it may not t>- j
amiss to tell something about th? i
standing and opinions of the leading ;
Journals in this country and about tbV :
men responsible for their respective i
policies.

father acting a> attorney for his wayward son. and casting all of
great ability into a plea for his life.
1 hese events are out of the ordinary. They go beyond the usual
- oi crime. They belong to a chapter of transgression that
- not many years ago and that is more and more crowded as it
-ens. The criminal statistics of the country show a progressive
be age at which criminals are arrested in their career
in hand by the law. There seems to be somewhere a lack
-cipline and a loosening of the bonds of morality, which sen
affect the youth of the country. Wantonness and waste of
idleness and an aimless life, seem to be responsible for a con
dition that may well arouse the keenest solicitude of the moralist and
the humanitarian.
We have abundant codes on child labor, on truancy during
school age. and we have our juvenile courts created to deal with
youthful offenders. All over the country are State reform schools

matter at all points. Perhaps the State has done too much and has

adapted to their years and strength, show that these conditions are

A PROSPECT OF PEACE.

the domestic loan now being made in Russia seem to have had
an effect which, added to the loss of Port Arthur and Mukden, is
likely to end the struggle. The condition of Russian and Japanese
credit is sharply contrasted by the fact that Japan borrows money
cheaper abroad than Russia can borrow it at home. This joins the
financial judgment of the outside world and of Russia in the con
viction that the struggle is hopeless.
The Slav army is retiring as rapidly as possible to Siberia, and
if the war continue nothing can prevent the fall of Vladivostok. It is
the pan of wisdom now not to encourage Japan in hardening her

LESSON
THE picture with to-day's ("all is a copy of an original painting
by the eminent Belgian artist, Helene Gevers.
In "The Water-Color Lesson" the artist has given us a most
beautiful picture. In its harmonious blending of colors and its faith
fulness to detail the effects produced are truly wonderful. The intent
and intelligent gaze of the young pupil, herself as beautiful as the
(towen she paints, as she studies the light, shade and color of each
leaf and petal before producing it on her paper; the critical pose and
expression of the teacher; the beautiful colors, so strong in the drap
eries and in the dress of the teacher, but so delicate in the flowers and
dress of the pupil â all contribute to the production of a beautiful pic
ture which it would be difficult to surpass.

KIND OF WOMAN A MAN WORSHIPS
The Home-Making Virtues Attract and Hold the
Sincerest Love.
DOROTHY FENIMORE
DOES woman reign through
beauty, through wisdom, or j
through virtue? When this 1
question was submitted a while |
ago to the judgment of modern I
Paris by a leading woman's paper of
France. La Vie Heureuse, the aolden j
apple of commendation fell into the lap
of oie who did not take part in that
Olympic contest of long ago. when the
simple shepherd of the Idalan hills got
into trouble by slighting the ox-eyed
mother of gods and men.
Minerva, virgin goddess of the owls
and money-plate, whose heart was ever
inaccessible to love, lost again. So. too,
this time did Venus, "most knowine in
the mystery of love. " Juno's name was
not even mentionedâ that's what hap
pens to quarrelsome women. It was
pure-minded Vesta who carried off the
prizeâ Vesta, gentle goddess of the
home, who never cared to have her fie
ure ensrfrined in public temples, but
was content to have her altar-flame
burn brightly on the hearthstones of
the land.
To-day the men of all civilized na
tions, under southern and under north
ern skies, worship not Venus, but
Vesta. They like good women, and
they like women who. like vestal fires,
have the gracious gift of making a
bare room look furnished just by being
in it. Any man. wise or foolish, may
fall in love with a pretty face: many
a one declares in all sincerity that he
most admires the intellectual type of
woman, but. whatever may be the par
ticular charm which wins a mans love,
'tis womanliness and the home-making
virtues which hold it.
Wherever the true wife comes, says
Ruskin, she carries the atm9sphere of
home about her. "The stars only may
be over her head; the glow-worm in
the night-cold grass may be the only
fire at her foot; but home is yet wher
ever she is: and for a noble woman it
stretches far round her. better than
ceiled with cedar, or painted with ver
milion, shedding its quiet light far, for
those who else were homeless."
Is not this a thought for a woman
to chÂ°rish! that fke herself may be
"home" to those who love her; that
without her presence therein the four
walls of her house would be just fv,ur
walls, and her roof tree oply a shelter?
Is she not fortunate that upon her de
volves the duty of keeping the hearth
fire lighted, so that those she iovos
may gather round it. and renew each
an enemy immensely her physical and financial superior, and has
so made war as to instruct the world and make it wise in the ways
of saving life as well as in destroying it. No other people have
done this in war. Let her be content and seize the opportunity to
advance peace on earth, and she will add immeasurably to the debt
the world owes her.
Even the most democratic of American babies is a despot when it comes
to a question of rule, â Baltimore American.
President Roosevelt is going to hunt in the "big thicket" of Texas. It
will probably be easy for him after hunting so long in the political labyrinth
at Washington. â Denver Republican.
Testimony taken in Philadelphia shows that ballot-box stuffing there
has been reduced to an exact science. No other way of accounting for some

elaborate model ever made and has
been entirely undertaken by William
Salter, a maker of models.
The model has been built in Lon

about 40,000 separate parts and is on a

Is she not blessed that Just by being
good she sets up in the windows of her
soul a light which, shtaing out upon
the darkness of the world outside, may
be a beacon to some tired travel* r who
has lost his way?
The sweetest love stories in the
world are love stories of happy mar
ried women. Of all the love poems ever
written, most tender, most triumphant
are "The Sonnets From the Portu
guese." written by a woman who
loved her husband with so great a love
that in some moods he seemed to her
so near she could not even think of
him. And of all the eulogies of wife
hood that were ever written that de
scription of Tennyson's wife is certain
ly most beautifulâ "that she walked by
his side for more than forty years,
quickening his insight, strengthening
his faith, fulfilling his every heart's de
sire."

Deacon Watrous was saying. "You see,
that young Wight thinks we ought to
have a man. Of course, you'll have my
vote, but Bill Stiles is always strad
dling a fence, and the last man he talks
to gets him. This young feller's high
falutin' talk kind of caught Bill's fan

in hand, and now he's leanln' our way
again. I'll stick to him tighter than a

till the meetin' is over. It's to-morrow

replied Lydia, raising grateful eyes,
"and if I get the place I'll do my best
to vindicate your choice."
"I'll do all I can, Lyddy," said the
deacon.

ing the position, counting on the deacon
and Bill for a quorum, but now this
young man, who had fallen heir to the
farm of his uncle, John Wight, and had
come to The Corners in her absence,
might carry his point of hiring a man
to teach.
She simply had to have the position,
and she determined to help Deacon
Watrous in his efforts to secure Bill's
needed vote. It would be useless for
her to appeal to Bill â "Weathercock
Bill," a? he was called. She resolved
to make a bold move and encounter
the enemy whom she had never seen.

THE "WINDOW MUSEUM"
Perhaps the most dignified method
of luring crowds is the one invented
by a firm of wholesale druggists that
exhibits the various stages in the
manufacture of well-known drugs,
from the crude original mineral or the
original plant down to the familiar
final products. There, for instance, is
the quinine exhibit, neatly labeled and
boxed, showing quinine in its various
stages of manufacture up to the flaky,
snowy powder, the taste of which is
more bitter than gall. Copper ores are
displayed, showing, step by step, how
the metal is taken out of the mineral,
and how, step by step, the manufac
turer produces the beautiful sky-blue
lumps of sulphate of copper, one of
the rankest of poisons. Opium poppies
are there, in full bloom and other
wise, and the different exhibits show,
stage by stage, the different products
that lead eventually to the finished
product of this plant, the nerve-dead
ening opium. In short, scores of di
verse drugrs are shown in their suc
cessive stages of development and' the
exhibits are as neat and minute and
perfect as if prepared for the drug ex
hibit at a world's fair. â Pearson's Mag

LOVE AND THE COTTAGE
When a girl is first engaged she fig
ures on a ten-room house in the swell
part of town, says the Atchison Globe.
As time goes on the house gradually
decreases in size until it is a four
room structure. Then all the fancy
trimming are left off, and next the
house is located in a remote part of
town. Finally when the wedding
comes off it is announced that the
couple will reside with the bride's
father.
A WOMAN'S LAUGH
A woman has no natural grace more
bewitching than a sweet laugh. It is
like the sound of flutes on water. It
leaps from her heart in a clear, spark
ling rill, and the heart that hears it
feels as if bathed in the cool, ex
hilarating spring. How much we owe
to that sweet laugh! It turns the
prose of our life into poetry. It flings
showers of sunshine over the dark
some wood in which we are traveling.
It touches with light our sleep, which
is more the image of death, but
gemmed with dreams that are shadows
of immortality.
AN AMBITION QUENCHED
"Some day you may be President of

over this same subject of a quorum.
When he succeeded to his Inheritance
he had determined to become a prac
tical farmer and win the esteemed
position his uncle had ever maintained
in the hearts of the simple country
folk. They had laughed at the young
man for thinking he could be a farm
er, but he had shown them he could
learn from them and improve on their
methods. They were glad to have
him succeed his uncle as a member oi
the school committee; that seemed to
be more in his line.
He had as firm convictions on the
educational question as he had on
most subjects, and he thought a man
% more fitted to wrestle with the diffl-
Vulties of a country school than a
woman. He had not seen this applicant,
but he did not approve of a young girl
who had no preparation or experience
in teaching.
In the midst of his cogitations there
was a rap at the outer door. H<e

girl, with big, innocent eyes and an
artless manner.

He acknowledged the introduction

Hugh Wight was not a susceptible man,
and Lydia's beauty only strengthened
him in his belief that she was not com
petent for the position of schoolteacher
at The Corners.

He was somewhat surprised at this
frank appeal. He liked directness.

J continued earnestly, "and if I don't get
the place it will go very hard with my

Huph felt as it he had been stealing

fripperies, then, but to help her
father.
"What do you mean by my influ

"It's like this," she explained. "Dea

Up to this time the eyes, voice and
manner of the young man had not been
at all encouraging; but in the hearty
' peal of infectious laughter that follow
| ed her request Lydia caught a note of
- appreciation, and some way she de-
L rived hope from his amusement.
1 "Miss Gardner, it strikes me as rather
odd that you should come and show ma
the way to gain my point and then ask
me not to take It." â¢-Â»;â 
"Maybe it is. " she said wistfully,
"but I don't know what else to do."
He remained in deep study for a mo
ment. He did net like to be Influenced
by personalities.
â¢â¢Well." he said abruptly, "I*ll not
â¢ speak to Bill or in his presence about
i this matter, and I'll waive my objec
tions for this year and vote for you
myself, though I still" believe a man
should have the place."
Two bright spots burned in Lydta'Â»
cheeks.
"Thank you. I will now hayÂ» an
other incentive to do my best. I shall
try to show you that I can fill the po
sition as acceptably as a man. You
look incredulous. They all said about
here that you, a 'city chap." could never
make a farmer, but you showed them
! you could. I'll show you I can make
i a teacher."
Having made this telling point. Lydia
took her departure. Immediately the
housekeeper came in and expressed hr
approval of Wight's concession,
i "Lyddy's a , smart gal, and for all her
j purty looks and baby way she's got a
heap of grit. Pity her pa didn't have
it. . He used to be a professor, and he
eddicated Lyddy to use good speech."
At the meeting the next night Lvdia
i received a unanimous vote, and when
school opened she was installed as
teacher. She made companions of the
j big boys and girls and pets of the little
i ones. The country people were per
fectly satisfied. In due course of time
Deacon Watrous and Bill Stiles came
to make the accustomed visit. Lvdia
was fully prepared for the occasion,
and invited them to question the class.
They knew but a few question? to ask.
and as they had paid many visits to
the school the pupils knew the answers
by heart. ' Then Lydia asked them to
sing a stirring war sonar and a hymn.
Bill's little girl spoke a piece. carefully
rehearsed beforehand. The two mem
bers went away enthusiastic over the
new teacher, and told Wight he had
better go and see for himself.
And he did, appearing suddenly and
unexpectedly, near the close of an In
dian â¢ summer afternoon. Lydla's ex
pression of dismay caused a titter of
appreciation among the older boys.
Instead of a reprimand she a:av<* them
an imploring look that could not hit

Lydia felt that the visitor had noted
the look and interpreted It as a con
fession of inability to govern.
Just as she was about to call upon
the school for a song, little Bob Hanks
let loose a mouse he had carefully
confined In his book bag. Excitement
prevailed among the girls and delight
among the boys. Had Lydia known
that she was to lose her position she
would still have done as she did now â
Jumped up on her chair.
Hugh caught the mouse, threw it out
of the window, ejected Bob and his
book bag, and, in stentorian tone, re
stored order. , Lydia came down from
her chair, and in her confusion called
upon the arithmetic class to come for
ward. She wished that Lige Jenkins
had remained at home that day. Arith
metic was not his forte. She planned
adroitly to omit him, but the visitor
instantly detected the omission and
pounced upon the unfortunate lady.
"Lige. " he asked, "how many times
does nine go in twenty-seven?"
To Lydia's dismay. Lige promptly
stepped to the blackboard and com
menced a solution via lon* division,
finally putting down "two" for an an
swer.
"Try again, Lige," urged Wight
cheerfully.
Lige then substituted the fljrnrÂ© ftmr
for two.
"You've got another guess coming.
Lige." ISHOBÂ§Eg'.

desperately came to his rescue. - "
"Lige. won't It go three times?" she
asked insinuatingly.
Llge looked at her anxiously.
> "Why, yes," he replied slowly, "it
will: but It's a dern'd tight squeeze!**
Then ' came that delightful, uncon
strained burst of laughter that Lydia
had heard once before from Hugh
Wight.. The school Joined with him.
The teacher looked at the .clock and
thankfully observed It was time for
1 dismissal. She stood at the door until
the ? last scholar had vanished. Then -
she came back to the platform, where
Wight, still sat and Llge lingered.
. "Say," observed the lad earnestly,
"faint her fault' I never did know

I the best teacher we ever had."

"Lige." said Wight gently," "you did
' better than I expected. There are lots
I of things in life more desirable than a
I knowledge of the science of numbers.
Take this dime and go down to The
Corners and see what it will buy."
The boy sped happily away." Lydia
raised her head. A little gleam of
anger and defiance flashed through the
tears.
"You can send and get a man teacher
as soon as you want to. I am glad I
am not ,a . man!"
"So am" I. Lydia," he said heartily.

both in its personality and its Ili i â â !

serves society seems to be

While this Christian friend was

she said, with the melancholy smile
which lent still further beauty to the
refined austerity of her face, "these

you are the soul of goodness." I
The fact that the story of Lady Kitty
Bristol is closely analogous to the his
tory of Lady Caroline Lamb's affair
Vith Lord Byron was called attention
to while the novel was in serial form,
but that scandal could only have sug
gested the outlines of Mrs. Ward's
fiction, and the similarity in no way
lessens our interest in Lady Kitty as
her own creation. We refuse to recog
nize Lord Byron in the poet. Cliffe and
William Ashe's wife would never have
been so silly as Caroline Lamb was
when she wanted to dance with a lame
mm, asd ate glass {because he would
not try to glide thus with her into
double folly. Kitty's story is of more
consequence than Caroline's, and it is
better to consider her interesting and
instructive case with our docile atten
tion unadulterated by the revival of
an old and silly scandal. So let us doff
aside the story about a story, and en
joy Mrs. Ward's artistic work, not as
a rehash of diguised history, but as
fiction in fact, and entirely novel.
It is the woman in the story who in
terests us most, but we have to con
sider the men to some extent if only
in order to try to comprehend the
woman, and why she made of her life
the wreck it came to. The two men
who mainly influenced her careerâ her
husband, and the roan who made her
unfaithful wife, are worth reading
about only as subsidiary to the study
cf Kitty. It is or. her that the gifted
authoress has lavished her powers of
making us follow her thought and feel
ing. She presents Cliffe. the man who
misled her, as a modern determinist
for which type there is no responsibil
ity. He waits on life, following
*nere it leads, rejoicing in each new
'feeling, each fresh reaction of con
sciousness on experience, and so links
his fatalist belief to that Nietzsche
doctrine of self-development at all
costs."'
To make the story of the misleading
of a woman as fine as Kitty convincing
to our Imagination there is required
.some strength of effort in portrayal of
"the man capable of both the weakness
and the evil strength to make her folly
fatal. Mrs. Ward has given us in Cliffe
& man who would have been all inade
quate but for the combination of : cir
cumstances by which the powers of
evil seemed to abet his schemes. He
was so distinctly a. lesser man than
Ashe we wonder at the woman's be
clouded brain that failed even for an
hour to know it. This Is not to say
that the novelist has not drawn him
with an art up to the standard of the
high literary rank she . holds. It is
Kitty's temperament she is studying
as the cause of the failure of the mar
riage of William Ashe^ that and the
peculiarities of the noble character of
her husband, which yet by mistaken
pride and fataJ oversight made possible
Kitty's error. These are the main
things; Cliffe is but subordinate cause
to them â the demon in the pit that's
always provided for the weak willed
and the morally blind,
Cliffe is a traveler, an artist, a poet
and a soldier. Here is the way in which
he tried to Justify himself for the un
happiness he brought into Kitty's life.
It la a sample of the authors powers in
the psychological part of her art: After
her husbands first shock of wrath and
pain, then there would come a sense of
deliverance. For her, too, deliver
ance! It excited this artist's sense to
think of ail the further developments
through which he might carry that
eager, piastic nature. There would be
a new Kitty, wikh new capacities and
powers. He felt himself a sculptor in
the very substance of life, molding a.
living creature afresh, disengaging it
from harsh and hindering conditions.
What was there vile In that? â¢ â¢ â¢
Little, delicate, distinguished thing! â
every aspect of her. angry or sweet,
sad or willful, delighted his taste and
sense. Moreover she was his deliver
ance, tooâ from an ugly entanglement
of which he was ashamed."
In describing Kitty's husband Mrs.
Ward is. of course, in the element
where her capacities are most at home,
for he is a typical Englishman of the
upper class. Handsome, well-born, ac
customed to mastery, wealthy, heir *<*
a title, and having the good natur .-;<-:Â£
conscious strength. He loves ''/JjlC*^
mother and is her darling and; :*iv.
pride. He takes upon himself resptÂ«a|i
bi!ities in government as by hereditary
right. When called to high position,
as happened just about* the time -he
met Kitty, he goes to his work in iron
ic mood, as one who does not believe
a word of his own speeches. He feels
himself as thrust in that position, and
but an actor among acton?, a shade
among shadows. He makes a mock of
his 0 own liabilities, and yet in his li
brary are shelved his well-read books

his qualification comes naturally by in- j
heritance. He was glad to be an Eng- j
lishman and a member of the English j
Government. "That a man should

find the occupations that suited him
and pursue them. On these terms life
was still amply worth the living, and
gingpr was still hot in the mouth."
He was deeply interested in religion.
but for himself believed nothing To
find out the more intimate and inter- â 
esting things about him we must ob- j
servp him in his relations with Kitty.
One of the first things w*Â» note in
these relations is that although Ashe
is naturally masterful, both by indi
vidual inclination and by virtue of his
breed, he from the very start resolves
to attempt no mastery over his wife.
That's a part of the book's psycholog
ical study, and the play of the charac
teristic and its effect are worth observ
ing from the first love scenes of dawn
ing passion to the dark end of the
tragedy. He knows Kitty is willful,
audacious, born of a bad mother, and
by her own confession given to strong
fancies for men â "overpowering fan
cies, and I must follow them"; he
notes she is but half chiM and half
woman, and yet he decides that as his
wiff she shall be free â that she may
scandalize half England, but he will
understand her and trust her. Even
when after the terrible trouble came
and the Dean solemnly, in his char
as Christian friend of the un
happy girl, asks him if he had done
all that love could, he replies that "it
isn't in me to play the tutor and mas
to my wife."
But in interesting connection with
this idea he had of himself, here's a
g':mpse of Kitty, and what she thought
I of Ashes mastery. She was far from
' home, close to the moral danger which
a little later caught her. Ashe had
written her to come back to him. She
threw the letter from her impulsively,
saying: "He commands me! I won't
be any man's chattel." So much for a
mans ideal of himself as one who
! would never attempt to enslave a
won
As to this question of husbandly
; mastery, however. th^ author says
\ neither yea nor nay. Not a word of
j praise or blame as to Ashes taste- or
| wisdom in the matter. Ashe may have
j his ideals, the Dean may consider mas
tery a Christian duty in such case, the
j willful Kitty may tee! her woman's
impulse about it: but the novelist gives
mo word direct. Nevertheless, her
whole beautiful, sad story is leading
i us to see that the true mastery Ashe
should have had at the critical time
was the mastery of tenderly making
j his wife aware that he still loved her.
Then the bidding her come home would
, ha\ - e seemed, not a tyrant command.
â¢ but a mastery in the art of love's be
| feeeching.
Mrs. Ward is here using her noble
art to show us that if a man who had
cultivated the quality of mind and
heart she suggests had married that
' bewitching creature, he could have
I made Kitty behave and not been the
! least bit bossy about it.
That she is a bewitching "creature.
j and one well worth the exertion of the
j finest art of conduct to make her be-
J have, is wherein lies the fascination of
j the book. To read it is to understand
J the spell under which Ashe fell when
! he found he could hardly take his eyes
' from the small sparkling face of this
! half woman, half child, so singular in
; her personality, and with "the wild
â  intelligence in her eyes."
Many fine word pictures does the
: author draw of her in differing dress, in
I varied moods, in actions alive with

! Just one: "Her large black hat em-

ALBERT DURER
AND THE WORK
OF THE ARTIST
Not memerly a biography of a great
artist, but also a very entertain
ing explanation of what art is.
and how It links itself to the .other
great things of life, is the imported
English book, "Albert Durer." by T.
Sturge Moore. When Moore was asked
to do this work by his editor, Arthur
Strong, who wished it to fill a part
of the series he was editing, Moore
demurred because of modesty as to his
attainments, but his editor assured him
that the method in which he wished
Durert life and work treated was in
the way of an appreciation of this
great artist in relation to general ideas.
His editors confidence in Moore's abil
ity to do this is proved well founded
by the interesting manner in which he
renews our sense of indebtedness to
Durer's greatness and helps us to re
alize the interdependence of art with
religion, morals, happiness, the con
quest of the universe by man's ideals,
and. in fact, all the things which make
life best worth having.
As the chief thought to develop in
this appreciation the author seizes
upon Durer's idea of "proportion," to
which that artist gave such predom
inant place. This is the main "gen
eral idea" to which' he links Durer's
art. and it "was the great German en
gravers method of determining the
value of things.
What we are to understand by the
term proportion." as used in this ap
preciation. Is explained at considerable
length, and is one of the best parts
of the book. So far as it can be stated
briefly it is to this effect: The author
conceives of human reason as the an
tagonist of all othâ¬r forces that we
know, ana that our hope and desire Is
to master and transform the universe.
This idea of Moore's will remind us of
Huxley's view that with the dawning
of the combined intelligence and moral
sense in man a new cosmic power came
into being different from and very an
tagonistic to all those forces which
Darwin had so well demonstrated as
the fixers of the course of evolution till
man's ideals became a cosmic coun
ter to what was evil In their reign.
Now, a* Moore states it, "All things
Impress the mind with two contradic
tory notionsâ thjeir actual condition and
their perfection. Even the worst of Its
kind Impresses on us an idea of what
the best would be. Reason then seizes
on this aspect of things which suggests
their perfection and awards them her
attention in proportion as such aspect
makes their perfection seem near, or
as it may further her in transforming
the most pressing of other evi^
AUTHORS OF SOME OF THE RECENTLY PUBLISHED BOOKS. MOST OF THE
Pl-BLICATIONS BEING INTERESTING ADDITIONS TO CURRENT HIGH
CLASS LITERATURE AND ALL OF THEM BEING READABLE.
"The sense of proportion then is that
fineness of ; susceptibility by which "we
appreciate in a given object, person,
force or mood serviceableness in re
gard to reasons work." .Vow as to this
fineness of susceptibility which he men
tions, it is a thing: to which art spe
cially appeals. ';'.;ThV value of a 'work
of art depends on its having come as a
"real, and intimate experience; to, a
large number -of ." gifted men." ' When
we judge as to the power of works of
art to make such appeal we must be
governed by; this sense of proportion
which measures how things - stand in
regard to reason in help of man's chief
demand,' "the demand for a nobler
life." In Durer's idea of ; this sense of
proportion. arid the right way of find
ing the valuation of things, he feltthe
sovereignty of the aesthetic conscience."
So he estimated the success of a work
of art's ; appear in regard to its ad
vancement of a more complete and har
monious life. This idea has connection
. with , the > thought of the great French
writer, Flaubert, when he said "Genius
is not rare nowadays, but conscience is
what nobody has and what one should'
strive after." ' - ,
Perhaps the most vivid way in which
one could - briefly make ; clear what
; Moore means 'by this general idea of
; proportion ;: and Durer's â '.-}. and ..other,
â¢ great artists' uses of it ; is to call back
to memory Omar Khayyam's poetry:
Ob, Love', could thou and ':â  I with Fate con-
L* - ,-' spire. .".'â â â¢ 'â -â ' â â ;â¢.â -â â  ' -â -''â :.. Â;â  â  - ;"'; "'

Then think how futile. â ' though beau
tiful, was the'-old Persian's t ; wish to
him, arid : still is to ; many souls to-day.
Now for. the * artist to '; master this
Durer idea of - proportion, and ; use it in
his work; and for the great discerning â 
public to appreciate it. grasp it, put the
inspiration of it into their ideals and
work by means of it ever ito : realize

; The finest; passage in all this appre
elation of Durer â the . one; best worth
quoting, and ' which will last longest in ;
the memory, is where he \~ describes
what is probably * Durer's greatest
work, the only one in which" his ardent
i appreciator thinks he sustains : com
parison I with 5 the greatest- Italian, the
copper engraving called "Melancholia."
Comparing ; his ] other works with this "\
he says: "They have not been fused
in the rapture of some unique mood, .
not . [', focused by ;, the :j.: j. intensity- of :an
emotion. _ With the "Melancholy" all â¢is
'different; perhaps ' mong a., his 'â¢, works
only Durer's most haunting portrait of
himseif has an equal or even similar
power to bind us In its spell. "
It will be remembered chat, the
great engraving pictures a woman,
wintr^d and wreathed, seated despon
dent,, holding a pair of compasses in
her lap. her troubled face leaning on
her hand, her brows knit in deep
thought, and her eyes staring Into
space. Around her feet lie scattered
the implements of many industries.
Above her, on the wall, hang an hour
glass, a bell, and a pair of scales; a
leaning ladder leads up to an indefinite
somewhere. A child plays on top of
a newry finished millstone by her side.
Here are some extracts of our author's
interpretation of this masterpiece:
"That face holds our attention as not
even the Sibylla Delphica can â not by
beauty, not by conscious inspiration,
but by the spell of unanswerable
thought, by the power to brood, by the
patience that can and dare go unre
solved for many years. Everything is
begun about her; she cannot see unto
the end; she is powerful, she Is cap
able in many works, she has borne
children, she rests from her labors,
and her thought wanders, sleeps or
dreams. " â¢ â¢ there she sits, ab
sorbed, unsatisfied. Impetuosity and
the frank avowal of intention are
themselves an expression of the will to
create that which is desirable; they
can but form the habit of every artist
under happy circumstances. Â« â¢ â¢
But the circumstances of the artist
never are happy: even Michael An
gelo's were not. An intense brooding
melancholy arises from the repressed
and baffled desire to create; and in
some measure this gloom of failure,
underlying their success, is a necessary
character of all lovely and spiritual
creations in this world."
Durer was an artist of extraordin
ary personal beauty, and was fond of
making pictures of himself. One of
his masterpieces is spoken of as "that
most haunting portrait of himself."
Those appreciators of the man and his
art who feel the force of this portrait
haunting their memories may add to
it the memory that it was he wTÂ»
taught. In his great idea of proportion
in art. that the right use of great gifts
of genius was to remald this sorry
scheme of things some nearer to the
Heart's Desire; that another of his
great Meas was the need of docility to
the master in any art: and that he be
lieved there was no discipline in do
cility equal to training in the difficult
task of learning religion.
THE PLUM TREE,
A STORY OF THE
POLITICAL BOSS
"The Plum Tree," by which title Da-
vid Graham Phillips, the author of the
new book so called, means the tree
from which fall those political plums \
of emolument and preferment Â» hlch
come sometimes as the reward of the
concscientious worker, and perhaps as
often fall plump into the lap of the
cleverly unscrupulous, is a story whlcn
may well set us wondering to what ex- j
tent we are becoming the slaves of
greedy corporations and corrupt politi
cal bosses. It is written by a man who,
from the fact of his having climbed i> j
a very highly paid position as political â 
editor of one of the largest New York
dailies, may be presumed to have the ;
interests, the talents and the opportu- .
nities to make his story* true io the j
realities Â«f the methods pursued and j
the characters who act in that life of j
practical politics which he reveals to
us as bting su tricky and so unton
scientious.
The book is not exactly literature.
but it is a strong outline sketch out of
which literature might be made, it bj
the picture of a great uauouai boss, '
holding such position of yoner beaind
the throne as men of the type ot Mark
Hanna have made the country' ""t* 1 - j
miliar with the potencies ot. Phil- :
iips will probably have a large num- ;
ber of readers for "The Plum Tre
he is well known as the author of thai
much-called-for book, "The Cost, " and
because the subject he treats of, civic
corruption, is coming more and more,
as our country advances in wealth, to
be one of most vital convern to the
people. The published facts <A the lack
t of conscience in our civil life show that
the fiction is not wildly imagined ex
aggeration, but such a vivid picturing
of actuality as is the province of the
art of realism to make us see the truth.
The story is told in the nrst person,
acd this method was well chosen by
Phillips in order to get the/full power
of his art to bring out one of the
strongest features of the book, which
is the portrayal of the self-contempt
that mingles with all the triumphs of
! the great political boss' career. Aft:-r ;
' he has lived this iife of ei>mpromise ',
' between unscrupulous acts and the
j sensitive pride of one who was natur
' ally noble when, as a youth, he formed
his ideals, he meets, after long sepa
1 ration, the woman who was his boy- j
! hood's love, and in this sentence to her i
! sums up the story which was his life:
: "I have convinced other people that I
am somebody at the cost of convincing
; myself that I am nobody."
It is this fact of the chief actor in
the novel being so much nobler than
the men who were playing the game
with him which gives the unfolding of
the story much of its psychological in
terest. It seems to be making it so
compelling!}' plain to our minds that
in all actually important world-work
there must be a line of compromise to
which high ideal of honor descends, j
touches, and there even partly mingles
with corrupt methods in accomplish
ing results. So cleverly does Phillips
do this that the story is actually re
pellant in places, causing us to feel
that the author himself is advocating
too far a descent from ideals of honor
down to the schemes that put plans
through to fulfillment. In one page he
says. In regard to his early career: "I
was then Ignorant of the great founda
tion truth of practical ethics, that a
man's conscience Is not the producer
but the product of his career." In an
> other place he says he has no doubt
that the average citizen, leading a
small, quiet life, cannot "understand
the way superior men play the great
games, the heartlessness of ambition,
the cynicism of political and commer
cial prostitution, the sense of superir
ity to the legal and moral codes which
comes to most men with success."
There is a love story running through
the book which is repellant. too. be
cause of its compromise of romance
and high honor for the sake of prac
tical success.
It would seem that Phillips might
! well have summed up the lesson of the
book in the line from Jean Paul Rich
ter: "To the dreams of thy youth be
trueâ 'tis that alone leads life to ex
cellence. " |

BERNARD SHAW
ON THE CHURCH
AS A STIMULANT
George Bernard Bhaw has written an !
essay "On Going to Church. ' in which
that brilliant, cynical mocker puts him
self on record as approaching so far
toward piety as to use "going to
church" as a stimulant instead of the
smokes, drinks and drugs which he
claims every doer of fine and difficult
brain work must brace up on unless he
avails himself of the inspiration which
comes of visiting the sanctuary- He
says: "It will not be disputed. I pre
sume, that an unstimulated saint can
work aa hard, as long, as finely and. on
occasion, as fiercely, as a stimulated
sinner."
The essay, which comes from The
Savoy" quarterly, is published in an
attractive little book of sixty paces.
In it Shaw's brains go off In the same
old fireworks fashion as is his wont. It
is a strange mixture of the exercise of
his true talent and vocation of a free
lance warring against ail the self-satis
fied shams ol ihe world and such a
cynical playing with his power to prove
that he can write brilliantly that all
his fight seems itself but a sham bat
tle, and waged for no purpose but to
show that Shaw Is brilliant.
Th/re is good to be got out of thÂ«
little book, though, and we can. if w*
wish, mentally eliminate Its irrÂ»v*r
ence and mocking: aa we glance
through it. If it were more wholly
pious and less brightly wicked thers
are people who would not read it. and
its lesson would be lost to those sin
ners who really, and not the righteous,
are the ones who are called. The gist
of ihe book is a sermon against stimu
lants. He says that all our fine brain
work is done under their influence;
that we could do still finer work with,
out them: that we cannot do with
out them unless we use some substi
tute, and that the only substitute Is
in the inspiration of "goin-- to
church. He delivers this sermon
with sufficient mixture of irrevsrsÃcs)
to prevent any of his anxious appre
i ciator* from fearing that he is con
tracting that form of relitfous learn
ing which results from beins; too
weak to be wicked. It is debonair al
ways â sometimes diabolical.
If we do not wish to abandon stim
: ulants we can learn from this essay of
j Shaw's how to select them for thÂ«
â¢ production of certain desired effects.
| Thus: Tea and coffee and cis^rettes
j produce conversation; lager beer and
I pipes produce routine journalism;
j wine and gallantry produce brilliant
. journalism and essays: brandy and ci
gars produce violently devotional po
j etry: morphia, tragic exultation, use*
j ful on the stage: and sobriety pro
j duces an average curate's sermon. "
That's his fireworks, but there ars
sent â â¢> -es in which he uses his literary
gunpÂ«.wdÂ«r to the accomplishment of
better work. Thus: To those pro
j fessional men whose art affords prac
j tically boundless scope for skill of exe
j cutlon and elevation of thought, to
take drug or dram is to sacrifice the
keenest, most precious Dart of life to
a dollop of lazy and vulgar comfort."
Shaw himseif has abstained from
( stimulants for twelve years: this fact
i should sive him some rights to
1 preach on the subject. He says: I
have not failed to observe that all
the drugs, from tea to morphia, and
all the drams, from laser beer to
brandy, dull the edge of self-criticism
and make a man content with some
thing less than the best work â¢Â£
which he is soberly capable. "
DISAPPOINTMENT
IN NEW VOLUME,
BY DR. MITCHELL
"Constance Trescot. " by Doctor B.
Weir Mitchell, while a fairly flood
story, will certainly produce much
of the disappointment which Is
the natural reaction caused by com
ing of an ovÂ«Â»rheralded good thins;. To
read it after having expectation roused
with the announcement "that it is one
of thÂ« best novels written in the New
World. " Is to lose much of the pleasure
the work might have given, but for thÂ«
falling down from the height of the
anticipation caused by that over
praise.
Besides the internal interest of the
book, there are the exterior ones to
pique our curiosity to read it is the
facts of Its having been written by Dr
Mitchell in his seventy-fifth year; that
to his own judgment it is the best
novel he has produced: that it is found
ed on a fact which came under bis
personal observation: and that he
wrote It three times In three consecu
tive years in ord/r to perfect it. and
every page of it has been corrected
and recorrected before it flnailv went
to press- All this slow elaboration was
done by an author who usually writes
so facile!)' that he finished one of his
best novels. "Hugh Wjnae, in six
weeks. That speedy execution of a de
sign, however, is to be considered with
the qualifying explanation that tha
author was thinking of the story for
seven years before he sat #>wn to
write it. A further interesting item iÂ»
that this latest painstaking literary
work was done by an author who Is a
physician still in active practice.
The character study is of a woman
who fitted well her name of Constance
in two ways; in a Juliet-ltke Intensity
of love for her husband, and in a vÂ«
detta constancy of hate for the man
who killed him. The chapter which de
scribes this killing of Trescot by the
detestable character, Greyhurst. iÂ» the
strongest in the book, and seemÂ» tn
some measure to justify the strenuous
ness of the literar* effort

Late Wolf Fleisher's Di
vorced Wife Sues for Big
Share of His Property
The story of a divorce of the long
ago is told in a suit filed yesterday by
;C. D. Salfleld, as assignee of Rifke
Glucklich Fleisher, to recover $88,000
from the estate of the late pioneer hat
and cap manufacturer, Wolf Fleisher,
who died recently leaving an estate es
timated to be worth a quarter of a mil
lion dollars. It is alleged that $88,000
is due to Mrs. Fleisher as her share
of the community property, which was
not awarded her at the time of the di
; vorce, with interest.
Rifke Fleish'er and Wolf Fleisher
married in San Francisco, the
â  plaintiff alleges, on February 12. 1867,
and lived together as husband and wife
for nine and a half years. Early in 1876
; Fleisher sued his wife for divorce. The
record shows that a default was en
tered against her and on April 27 of
; that year he was granted a decree.
'. The court, however, it is claimed, made
no ordei relative to the community
property, which at that time was
i worth in the neighborhood of $60,000.
Mrs. Fleisher, plaintiff continues,
first learned on October 5, 1904, that
Fleisher had obtained a divorce from
; her, she having departed to Cracow,
; Austria, prior to the commencement of
I the suit and she has resided there ever
, since. When she learned of the di
| vorce, it is set forth, she recalled that
she was entitled to a large portion of
her former husband's estate. During
1 their married life, she claims, her hus
' band accumulated $32,500 profits from
his hat and cap factory, property on
Post street, near Hyde, worth $23,500;
, lots in the Paul Tract at Berlin and
Wilde streets, worth $2000, an# a lot
at Folsom and Seventeenth streets
worth $2000, totaling $60,000 in value.
No share of this community property
was awarded to her at the time of the
divorce, she says, and that she is en
titled to one-half of this amount and
interest from the date of the decree of
; divorce, April 27, 1876. Interest on the
! principal of $30,000. her half of the
1 community property, she says, now
amounts to $55,000.
On February 4 last, Sal field, as as
signee of Mrs. Fleisher. presented her
claim to Esther Fleisher, administra
trix of the estate of the late Wolf
Fleisher. hut it was rejected. Salfleld
n<-Â«w asks judgment of the court for an
accounting and for a declaration that
Fleisher held the assignor's portion of
his estate in trust for her during all of
these years, and that he be given judg
ment against the estate for $88,000 and
interest from February 4 last, the date
of the rejectment of the clAm by the
administratrix of the estate that now
enters its career of litigation. Arthur
H. Barendt is attorney for the plain
tiff.

.ADVjERTISE^IENTS.
The hair â
of your head
The hair of the head is
far more sensitive to
Climatic changes than is
usually supposed, and this
fact is peculiarly apparent
in California.
When the hair becomes
dry, brittle and falls out
and dandruff forms upon
the scalp it is an absolutely
certain indication of
diseased conditions, which,
unless promptly treated,
will result in baldness.
Coke Dandruff Cure is
the only remedy thus far
discovered which will not
only remove dandruff, but
will positively grow
ne\* hair.
That it will do so has
been proved by thousands.
It is a perfectly pure
liquid, free from even a
trace of sediment, sulphur
or any injurious ingredients
whatsoever.
It is delightfully refresh- 1
ing, and under its benign
influence the hair quickly
regains the softness and
gloss of youth, and a new,
vigorous growth takes the
place of that which has been
lost.

Briskness continues .in the local
realty market. Business properties
that have income-earning capacity as
sured or are promising for speculative
holding, naturally have a strong lead
in the favor of investors. The con
tinued building of costly structures in
the business centers and the success
that is met in renting them promptly
form an argument of great strength
for judicious buying. There is no lack
of purchasers for home sites and for
residences that are well situated. A
long string of leases has just been ef
fected. They prove the firmness of the
general conviction concerning the
j solidity of the present situation.

ISLAND RULER WHO. IS ANXIOUS TO RESTORE THE CREDIT OF HIS I.IT
. TLE NATION WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE UNITED STATES BUT
WHOSE- PLANS THE UNITED STATES SENATE HAS UPSET.
WaSHLVGTOX, March 25.âRe
newed interest in Santo Domingo af
faire was manifested in official < ircles
to-day upon the receipt by the State
I>epartment of a cablegram from Min
> ister Dawion indicating that he had
effected with the Dominican Govern
ment a tentative agreement, which,
temporarily at least, would adjust
satisfactorily the fiscal conditions of
the island government. No explicit
Information concerning the contents
of Minister Dawson's cablegram is
available at this time, as it has not
been communicated to President
Roosevelt. It is believed, however,
to be of *uch importance that the
President will take action upon it as
soon as it is made known to him.
While the precise nature of the ne
:oni between Minister Dawson
and the Dominican officials cannot be
"j. it is understood that the
agreement contemplates the placing
of the fiscal affairs of the island Gov
ernment, so far as the collection of
vjee is concerned, in the hands
to be designated
â¢ esident Roosevelt, with the con
sent of the Dominican Government.
Th* revenues of the island would be
ted by the Commissioner, a suf
ficient percentage of them being
placed to the credit of the Dominican
Government to pay current expenses,
and the remainder deposited as a fund
to pay the foreign claims of the island
Gox'ernment at such time as a distri
bution of the fund may be agreed
upon by the creditor Governments.
It is Intimated strongly that Presi
dent Roosevelt would receive such a
proposition with favor, if 1t should be
known to be satisfactory to the Santo
Domingo Government, although in en
tering into the agreement, if it actu
has been made. Minister Dawson
acted without specific instructions
from this Government and entirely
upon his own initiative.
Minister Dawson cabled from San
Domingo to-day that the receipt of the
news of the failure to ratify the treaty
had caused a great deal of excitement
end disappointment in Santo Domingo.
A reply was sent by Acting Secretary
Adee. which stated that it was hoped
by the administration that the treaty
would be ratified when Congress again
r.bled. It was further explained
treaty was favorably report
ed that a large majority of the
â¢ p was lr. favor of it. Dawson also
~>*en informed of the selection of
ssor Hollander as the President's
lal representative to visit Santo
:rig-o to inquire into the financial
â¢nditlons and the history of the vari
ous claims, and it is expected that
these signs that the American Govern
ment is not abating its interest in the
projected international settlement may
'â perate to prevent the situation reach-
Ing a crisis.
SAN DOMINGO, March 25â
egrams published in the United States
that diplomats here and fiscal:; repre
sentatives of foreign governments
which are creditors of Santo Domingo
have at a conference agreed on 'â  a tem
porary settlement of the fiscal question
Involving this republic are premature.

tion to demand payment of their
claims.
In order to meet the situation it has
been proposed by the Dominican Gov
ernment that an American be desig
nated as commissioner for the collec
tion of all customs at southern ports,
45 per cent of which collections be set
apart for the expenses of the Govern
ment and 55 per cent, less expenses of
collection, being deposited in an Amer
i<aui bank until the Sanrhez-Dilling
ham convention is either ratified or re
jected; should the convention be ulti
mately rejected the money to be di
vided in just proportion to all cred
itors, ineli'dins the Santo Domingo
Improvement Company of New York.
It is also mjfttmttft that the Ameri
can Government take charge of the
Custom-houses at Sanchez and Samana
under the arbitral award in the Santo
Domingo Improvement Company case.
It is understood the improvement
company, claiming: prior rights, de
mands that 55 j.er cent of the moneys
collected at the northern ports be also
deposited in an American bank to
await the final disposition of the con
vention. It is doubtful if such a prop
osition will be accepted.
Thus far nothing has been decided.
The Government is desirous of some
agreement being reached in order to
prevent differences -with European
creditors which might lead to inter
vention and also precipitate internal
troubles. The country* is quiet, although
the situation is unsettled.
PETTY REVENGE
ON FISHERMEN
Newfoundland Attributes
Defeat of Hay-Bond Treaty
to Gloucester Trawlers
HALJFAX, Nova Scotia, March 25.
The business interests of Halifax,
Lunenburg and other Nova Scotian
ports are intensely interested in the
situation which has been created by
the Newfoundland Government re
voking the bait purchasing privilege
enjoyed by United States fishermen.
Some of the Nova Scotia newspapers
indorse the action of the Newfound
land Government and place the blame
for the present difficulty upon the
fishermen of Gloucester, Mass., by
whose influence, it is declared, the
United States Senate practically nulli
fied a treaty which had been drawn up
by Secretary of State Hay and Premier
Bond of Newfoundland.
It is pointed out that the interests
which brought about the existing un
pleasantness are the chief sufferers.
A peculiarity of the situation is the
fact that a very large proportion of
the men in the Gloucester fleet are
Nova Scotians. If tha action of New
foundland should prove serious to the
Gloucester fleet it is said more Nova
Scotians than Americans would feÂ«l it.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LINCOLN, Neb., March 25.âNebras
ka has developed a second Mrs. Chad
wick in the person of Mrs. Edith Smed
ley, who to-day occupied the guest
room of the County Jail here. Mrs.
Sinedley is accused of having obtained
$15,000 from a wealthy retired farmer,
Joseph Wells by name. Scott Smedley,
husband of the woman, is supposed to
have aided and abetted her.
The marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Smed
j ley followed a two weeks' courtship.
The woman is said to have had two
| former husbands at Topeka, Kans. Her
; power over Wells was supreme. After
i her marriage in Lincoln, she and her
! husband lived in a house belonging to
j Wells, who collected the rent and soon
j became enamored of the woman and
[ asked her to become his wife. She
: told him she must have money in order
i to get a divorce and he gave her $2200.
' With this the Smedleys moved to Den
ver and went into business. Wells be
lieved the woman was in Illinois get
ting her divorce.
A little later she wrote to him again
that she had a piece of property in
Florida mortgaged for $3000 and wished
to clear off the mortgage that she
might sell it. This sum also was
forthcoming, as well as several other
amounts.
Finally she wrote from Denver that
she was in business there and needed
$8000 immediately to pay off pressing
obligation*. On her statement that the
divorce had been obtained and that she
would return to Lincoln the following
Sunday and marry him. Wells sent her
the $6000 and Avhen the woman did not
keep her part of the agreement he went
to Denver to learn why.
In Denver, Wells found the Smedleys
livings in considerable style. They en
tertained him liberally, but when he
became importunate Mrs. Smedley ap
peared indifferent and her husband
"jollied" the Lincoln jsnan on the ease
with which he had parted with his
money. Wells returned home and war
rants charging Mrs. Smedley with em
bezzlement and her husband with con
spiracy were sworn out. The couple
spent the day in the Lincoln jail, but
to-night Wells himself came forward
with a $6000 bond and they were re
leased.
Mrs- Smedley is a tall blonde, whose
extensive and gorgeous wardrobe is the
wonder of every one at the jail, where
she wears a pale blue silk tea gown,
ruffled with lace.
DENVER, March 25.â Following the
denouement in the career of Mrs- Edith
Smedley, Denver creditors have swoop
ed down upon all attachable property
of the woman they\ could find. The
bank account of the Smedlevs at the
First National has been attached by
the Lewis Jewelry Company to secure
payments on notes for $650 given by
Mrs. Smedley to Joseph I. Schwartz, a
jeweler, in part payment for $1000 worth
of jewelry- The automobile purchased
by Mrs. Smedley has been attached for
garage charges.
Late developments Indicate that
Wells is not the only man whom Mrs.
Smedley, or Mrs. Simmons, as she was
then known, ensnared. Those whose
names are now connected with the case
are: Joseph Wells. Lincoln, Neb.; E.
W. Hooker, Center, Tex.: J- H. James,
San Marcial, N. M.; N- M. Elliott. Mil
waukee, Wis. ; Lewis Jewelry Company,
Denver; Emory Willets, Topeka, Kas. ;
S. J. W. Bundy, Ellis, Kas.
Hooker, a Texas lawyer, was her
latest admirer. J. H. James, son of a
mine owner, met her in Sallna, Kas.
N. M. Elliott was a traveling man, who
married her while she was the wife of
Emory Willets, a farmer at Grants
ville, Kas., and while she was being
wooed by James. Bundy was a station
agent at Junction, Kas-, who, because
Bhe would not wed him, is said to have
taken poison, but recovered.
Mr. and Mrs. Smedley and Wells will
arrive in Denver in the morning Wells
signed the bond of both in Lincoln to
day, after Mrs. Smedley and he had
talked in her cell a while. She was
seated beside him when the train left
Lincoln and her husband was in the j
background.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, March 25.â How one man
suffered himself to be sent to prison in
order that a similar punishment might
be meted out to a former friend and
partner in crime was brought out in
the case of Charles Harris and Henry
Miller, when they were to-day sen
tenced to the Joliet Penitentiary for in
definite periods.
The trial revealed the fact that Har
ris had come to Chicago from New
fork for the express purpose of assist
ing in sending Miller to prison, even
sacrificing himself In order to accom
plish his purpose, because Miller had
informed upon him in New York and
had assisted in sending him to prison
for a crime he committed in that city.
Miller denied that he was guilty of
burglary in Chicago. Harris then turn
ed upon his old pal and caused surprise
by pleading guilty to the charges
against him and then making a confes
sion in which he implicated Miller in
the crime.
Harris is 34 years old and has spent
a considerable portion of his life be
hind prison bars, and ,the prospects
now are that he will remain a prisoner
the remainder of his days. He served
three terms in Sing Sing Prison, three
terms on Blackwell's Island, two terms
in the House of Refuge, New York, and
one term in the House of Correction.

WASHINGTON, March 25.â President
Roosevelt and Secretary of War Taft
are giving all their energy and their
best thought to the solution of a prob
lem which is of far greater personal
importance than the Isthmian canal
question, rate bill, tariff legislation or
treaties.
They are very busy trying to reduce
their weight. To this end they are
working continually, heroically, even
desperately, for the situation with both
of them has reached the stage which
doctors refer to as "serious, if not
critical."
The President weighs more than 200
pounds and Taft weighs more than 300
â how much more neither of them will
tell. If the truth were known it prob
ably would be found that Taft weighs
nearer 220 than 200.
In their Joint extremity the President :
has returned to lawn tennis with a
vengeance, all other methods having
failed; and Taft has taken up horse
back riding with desperate earnest
ness. Mr. Roosevelt spends at least
two huurs every day on the private
$2000 court back of his office, and Taft

PARIS, March 26, 1:80 a. m.â lnquiry
late last night tends to strongly con
firm the statement in yesterday's dis
patches that approaches toward peace
between Russia and Japan have al
ready been begun at a prlvat* confer
ence in a northern European capital.
In view of the statement from St.
Petersburg that pour parleurs ware go
ing on in Paris, a press correspondent
last night called at the Russian Em
bassy and the Japanese legation. Em
bassador Nelidoff stated specifically
that he knew nothing about such ne
gotiations being in progress herÂ» and
Minister Motono, while declining to
discuss the general question of peace,
authorized the statement that no pour
parleurs were occurring in Paris. At
the Forefcn Offic* also It was stated
that officials there wert not awara of
steps toward peacÂ«.
The foregoing statements by Count
Nelidoff and Dr. Motono, while indicat
ing that negotiations arÂ« not proceed
ing here, do not alter the main state
ment that peace preliminaries are ac-
tually progressing elsewhere. The real
explanation is probably to ba found in
the Paris dispatch of last evening that
a preliminary conference had already
been held at a northern European ea; -
ital. There are strong indications that
this capital is Stockholm and that the
negotiations will be conducted at
that city if the preliminaries prove
successful. Copenhagen also is men
tioned, but it is understood that the
point was raised against past or fu
ture conferences there that a large
and influential British element is at
that capital, whose sympathies might
be hostile to Russia.
NAMES NOT REVEALED.
The personage acting for Russia in
the preliminary stage of the negotia
tions is described as a "leading gen
eral."
The personage acting for Japan is nut
disclosed, but he is believed to be one
who has heretofore taken no promi
nent part in Japanese affairs.
There is reason to believe that
Petersburg and Tokio are aware of tha
results of the meeting and that sim
ilar information is in the possession of
certain diplomatic circles in Paris.
This simultaneous receipt of ider
information in St. Petersburg and
Paris probably accounts for St. Pe
tersburg's view that the preliminary
actually occurred here.
Concerning the final result of peace
efforts they seem to hinge less upuu
the actual terms than upon Japan "s
willingness to pause during the suc
cessful culmination of her military
campaign, as Japan is proceeding on
the theory that one* in possession of
Vladivostok she can dictate her own
terms, including an indemnity, which
Russia thus far has strongly resiatad.
HAYASHI STILL DENTING.
LONDON. March 15. â Officials and
diplomats in London preaaxva a
sphynx-llke slienca on the subject of
peace prospects in the Far East Tha
information contained in tha press
dispatches from St. Petersburg to-day
was conveyed to Baron Hayashi, tha
Japanese Minister to Great Britain.
The Minister disclaimed all knowledge
of negotiations and repeated his for
mer statement that Japan intended to
continue the war until Russia ex
pressed a desire to make terms of
peace.
While, naturally. It Is Impossible to
obtain any direct confirmation from
official sources, the manner of tha re
ception of the press Information by
officials conveys the impression that
there is cognizance of tentative pro
ceedings, at* least, and that much more
is known than will be admitted.
In well informed circles in London
it has been known for some time that
peace in the near future is not only
possible, but probable. All move
ments leading up to the commence
ment of actual negotiations have been
concealed under such a successful
show of ignorance that even those in
the closest confidence of thÂ« highe.se
personages have been deceive-'.
British official said to-day:
"Even if I knew it were true that
these negotiations were going on I
would consider it little less than a
crime to give out even a hint of their
nature, as so much hangs in the bal
ance and so much might be lost by
premature disclosures."

ST. PEIEKSBUnG, March. 25.,âAl
though public interest in the war has
suddenly been transferred from the
Lattieneid in Manchuria to the Indian
Ocean by the possibility of a great na
val conflict between Admiral Kojest
vensky and Admiral Togo, and despite
reports that scouting vessels have al
ready been engaged near- the island of
Mauritius, tile Admiralty declines to
display any excitement. Indeed, the
tranquillity manifested is quite unnat
ural, except on the theory that, pend
ing the prospects of peace negotiations,
Admirai Rojestvensky has received or
ders to beep out of the way of the Jap
anese. Although without direct ad
vices, the Admiralty does not credit the
report of the meeting of scouting ves
sels off Mauritius. The same thing
holds good in regard to the report of
the sinking of the Russian battleships
Sissoiviliky and Navarin, which, it is
declared, probably was an arrant in

It can be asserted, however, that the

the exact figures. From these it ap

and 216.321 tons of munitions and sup
pttea to the front, declaring the trans

organ admits that the army in the Far
when the war opened was hardly
worth the name (no figures are given,
but it is known that the troops did not
exceed 60.000 men), practically defend

GUNSHTJ PASS, Manchuria, March
25. â On the front all is quiet. Both
Bides are busily reorganizing and ef

A large party of Japanese prisoners
passed through this place on the way
to Hnrbin. One of the Japanese is
a spy, who was captured in a uniform
of the Eleventh Siberian Rifles. He
will be tried by court-martial.
Reports to the effect that General
Ma has occupied Mukden and Tie Pass

The Japanese have refused to con

Field Marshal Oyama informing him
that the Japanese will enter Kirin on

which Japan would conclude peace,
he said:
'"ihe source of my original Infor
mation on this subject was a high one,
but it is gratifying to receive this con- :
firmation. The European powers, not- ;
ably France, have for some time been
endeavoring to find out on what terms
Japan would acqept peace. These ,
have been stated in a general way i
and have been communicated to St.
Petersburg. When he called his war
council on March 14 the Emperor
knew, these terms and doubtless com- :
municated them to his Ministers.
"Japan's apparent reticence regard
ing the opening of peace negotiations
is not due, as far as I can learn, to a
desire to continue the war, but the
Tokio Government wishes to be cer
tain that Russia is proceeding to
peace negotiations in good faith and
is not playing for time, as she did in
the negotiations orior to the war."
ST. PETERSBURG, March 25.â
The information contained in these
dispatches for more than a week re
garding the change in Emperor
Nicholas' attitude concerning the ad
visability of making a pacific proposal
to Japan is fully confirmed, and in
very high quarters peace within six
weeks is regarded as certain. The
positiveness with which this Is af
firmed would indicate that the Gov
ernment is already In possession of in
formation as to the Japanese terms,
which indicate a basis to which
Russia can agree.
The exact situation is shrouded in
mystery. The secret of what has been
done and what is being done is zeal
ously guarded. The press hears,
however, from a source close to the
throne that pour parleurs are actually
in progress in Paris, but of a pre
liminary character, and that Copen
hagen may be the scene of the first
exchanges between representatives of
the two powers.
In this connection importance is be
ing attached to the visit of D'lswolski,
Russian Minister at Copenhagen, and
Baron Rosen, former Russian Min
ister to Japan, to Bompard, the
French Embasaador to Russia, on
Tuesday. The parties to this confer
ence refuse to admit that significance
!a attached to it. In the meantime the
Foreign Office is silent.
"NIPPONIZIXG" CHINA*
Japan's Agents Active Throughout the
Yellow Empire.
BERLIN, March 25. â A letter from
Peking published by the National Zei
tung this morning gives the results of
an inquiry into Japanese political ac
tivity in China. The writer says Jap
anese agents in various lines of busi
ness are penetrating into China and
settling in every important place in
the empire, devoting themselves to
their calling in life, whether priest,
editor, teacher or trader, and to win
ning peacefully the good will of the
Chinese for Japan.
The method most used is the found- i
ing of newspapers printed in the Chi- ',
nese language and friendly to Japan
ese aims. These try to influence the
provincial Governors and the Peking
Government to employ Japanese
teachers in schools and especially to
place Japanese military instructors in
charge of the Chinese troops.
In addition, Japanese Buddhist
monks have begun to arrive in China
on semi-political â¢ and semi-religious
errands. They seek closer relations
with the Chinese Buddhist organiza
tions and have acquired control of |
several monasteries over which the
Japanese flag is floated. The monks
also establish Buddhist chapels and
organize congregations. Their de
clared aim is to unite the various
Buddhist sects in China. The Bud
dhist monasteries in Canton already ;
have placed themselves under the pro- j
tection of the Japanese flag and have
become branches of the great Pen
Yuan Thue monastery at Tokio. At I
Swatow, province of Kuangtung, Jap- j
anese monks have rented a temple,
over which the Japanese flag has been
hoisted, and they already have 800
followers.
WAR IMPOVERISHES NEUTRALS.
Chinese Red Cross Is Caring for Thou-

NEWCHWANQ, March 25. â Since
the battle of Mukden the Chinese Red
Cross has been feeding 15.000 refu
gees. Thousands of them are housed
at Sinmintin, Mukden and Liaoyang.
Many farmers of the Liaoyang district
are still dependent on relief. Since
the beginning of the relief work the
Red Cross has expended $76,000 on
grain alone. The railroad has trans
ported more than 60,000 refugees In
side the great wall. Owing to the ap
proach of warm weather the farmers
are going to their homos, but they are
<n want of implements and animals.
Special commissioners are conducting
an li.vtstigation Into the situation and
the G( vernment will undoubtedly sup

ATTITUDE
OF CASTRO
IS HOSTILE
President of Venezuela
Manifests No Desire for
Peaceful Negotiations With
Tinted States and France
AIIROGANT DICTATOR
DEFIES "BIG STICK"
Xot Only Refuses to Arbi
trate American Demands
but Will Not Even
Discuss the Proposition
PARIS. March 25.â An official dis
patch from Caracas, Venezuela, says
President Castro, who was absent dur
ing the reesst supposed amelioration
of th? situation, has returned and
manifested strong hostility against
American and French interests. His at
titude, it is ad'led, is particularly men
acing against the French Cable Com
pany.
It is premature to say what steps
France will take, as the information
has just been received, and the officials
have not had an opportunity to con
sider it. However, it is likely that the
action will depend upon President
Castro putting his menaces into effect
by overt acts against the company or
the forfeiture cf its concessions. No
orders for warships to pc held in readi
ness have yet been issued or are con
templated for the present, but there
seems to be a growing impression In
official quarters that the presence^ a
warship in Venezuelan waters might
exercise a salutary influence.
The official dispatch adds that Presi
dent Castro's declination to arbitrate
the American demands was accom
panied by a refusal to hold any con
versation on the subject. The French
Cable Company has received advices
practically to the same effect. These
indicate that President Castro's in
fluence probably will cause theÂ» court
to render final judgment upon the ca
ble company's concession early next
week.
It is the unofficial opinion that the
attitude of President Castro against
both Aemrican and French interests
makes the moment opportune for some
exchange of communications between
the two governments toward eventual
action along similar lines.
WASHINGTON, March 25.â 1n a
brief cablegram received at the State
Department to-day from Minister
Bowen, dated at Caracas, the Minister
refers to the action taken in the case
of the French Cable Company, not,
however, indicating that it has been
postponed, but rather that it is still
pending on the court's docket, ready
for consideration, and that the matter
is in a chronic rather than an acute
phase.
HONOR THEIR DEAD HORSES.
Services Hold at Miyagi for Animals
Killed in the War.
VICTORIA, B. C, March 25.â Advices
were received by the steamer Kanagwa
Maru of a monster funeral service held
at Miyagi Temple for the horses killed
during the war. In the presence of the
Governor and other officials the priests
gave a posthumous name to the vic
tims and posts were erected to mark
the supposed burial places of the dead
horses. Offerings consisting of beans
and wheat were placed on a large altar
and a number of Buddhist priests read
prayers. The obsequies were the same
as those of soldiers. The president of
the Miyagi encampment of military
horses delivered a memorial address
for the horses.
A bullet-proof breast plate Invented
by a Tokio man was successfully test
ed at Omori range on March 3. The
apparatus, weighing ten pounds, was
not pierced even at the shortest range.
At twenty-five yards a dent was made,
but the regulation rifle bullets did not
penetrate it.

St. Petersburg Expects a Lull In the
Far Eastern War.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 26. â
General Linevitch continues the re
tirement of the bulk of his army
northward.
The general staff now declares it is
certain that Field Marshal Oyama has
been compelled to relinquish the idea
of a pursuit in force for the present.
The Japanese forces on the Russian
flanks are too light to constitute a
serious danger, and a lull in heavy
fighting for weeks, if not months, is
predicted by some of the correspond
ents.
A Russian correspondent warns the
St. Petersburg authorities of the dan
ger of Japanese activity in Mongolia,
where, he saya, their emissaries are
enlisting the Lamas and arousing
their old warlike spirit.
PROMISE OF BIG CROPS

MARYSVILLE, March 25.â "Prom

the history of the valley," said Hamil
ton "Wright of San Francisco to-day.
"It will be a bumper crop yew. Not
| only are all grains and grasses mak
ing remarkable growth, but for fruits
the season is so far advanced that the
bulk of the crop can be easily mar
keted ahead of competition. The only
danger would be from a killing frost
and there is little likelihood of that in
the opinion of many with whom I have
talked. Prospects are good for heavy
yields of all deciduous fruits. Almonds,
apricots and peaches are probably past
danger from frosts. Frosts would
damage the grapes, though. In fact it
is said thÂ« vbllav nf>vi>r looked better " !

Panic - Stricken Travelers

3lade for Life Preservers
HALIFAX,. N. S., March 25.â Two
great trans-Atlantic liners, the Paris
ian of thq Allan line, and the Albano,
a Hamburg-American boat, both bound
in, heavily loaded with passengers, col
lided off the harbor's entrance to-night.
Both were seriously damaged, but
reached their docks and landed their
passengers safely. There was a panic
among the passengers on both ships
when the steamers struck.
The Parisian's stern touched bottom
as she reached her wharf, while hard
pumping kept the Albano free. Both
steamers were irom European ports,
the Parisian from Movllle, and the Al
bano from Hamburg. The Parisian had
about 1000 passengers, many of whom
were bound for St. John, N. B. The
Albano carried about 800 passengers,
nearly all for Philadelphia, to which
port she was to have proceeded after
calling here.
The Parisian is one of the finest of
the Allan fleet and carried on this trip
400 sacks of mail and 1100 tons gen
eral cargo. An examination of her to
night showed the entire afthold to be
filled with water as far forward as the
engine-room compartment. She reats
on mud bottom. On the opposite side
of the same pier is berthed the Albano
with her stem twisted and bow plates
damaged. It is believed that she can
be temporarily repaired so as to pro
ceed on her voyage to Philadelphia.
The weather at the time was quite
clear. According to Captain Johnson
of the Parisian, the Albano, on ap
prcaching from sea, signaled that she
would pass astern of the Aljan liner,
but a moment later headed for the
Parisian. Captain Johnson said that
he rang to the engine-room to go ahead
full speed and his vessel had Just at
tained headway when the Albano
struck the Parisian. The bow of the
Albano smashed a hole twelve feet
wide and extending from the rail to
below the water's edge. After the col
lision the Albano drew off and hastily
securing a pilot, followed the. Parisian
into port. Meantime the passengers of
the Parisian became panic-stricken.
The deck was well filled with passen
gers, many of whom were immigrants
bound to the Canadian Northwest.
These rushed about the deck, women
fainted and there was a mad scramble
for life-preservers.

LACK WITNESS
TO PROVE DEED
Mrs. Stanford's Death Pre
cludes All Hope of a Con
viction in Poison Case
The identity of the person who
placed strychnine poison in the bottle
of Poland water In the California
street home of the late Mrs. Jane I*.
Stanford on January 14 may never be
learned by the interested public. Al
though It was announced by the po
lice three days ago that they had
satisfied themselves as to who was the
guilty person, it became known yes
terday that they are fearful that they
will never be able to bring the sus
pect to the bar of justice. That the
law is not broad enough to enable the
police to convict any one of the of
fense is the decision of District Attor
ney Byington and Attorney Mountford
Wilson, who have conferred over the
legal end of the case and found them
selves without sufficient foundation
for a prosecution.
Having satisfied themselves that
Mrs. Stanford died a natural death In
Honolulu, the detectives have turned
their attention to unraveling the mys
tery surrounding the poisoned bottle
of Poland water. They have found
strychnine in the Stanford house on
California street and also at Palo Alto.
They have their suspicions strongly di
rected toward one of Mr*. Stanford's
most trusted employes and would
probably continue on their search for
criminating circumstances against this
particular person but for the fact that
the law stands In the way of a con
viction should an arrest be made.
NO CONFESSION EXPECTED.
Even If the detectives are able to
prove that a servant bought the
poison or procured it from the bottle
of strychnine found at Palo Alto or
at the California-street residence and
put it in the Poland water, it would
be necessary to further prove that
Mrs. Stanford had drunk a portion of
the water, and this is impossible for
the reason that Mrs. Stanford, who
alone could have testified to this fact
Is dead. While it is true that Mrs.
Stanford told Miss Berner that she
had .trunk of the water, such testi
mony would not be admissible at a
trial.
The only hope of the detectives is
to force the suspected servant to mak
a confession, a feat that none of them
are expected to accomplish. Possibly,
they think, it may be proven that the
strychnine was placed in the Poland
water after Mrs. Stanford had taktn
a drink, with a view of casting sus
picion on Mlsa Berner, but it such
proved the cause the detectives are
agreed that no crime was committed.
THOUGHT POLAND WATER ST \LE
It is now an established fact that
Mrs. Stanford did not at first believe
that an attempt had been made to
poison her, for when she summoned
her maid and Miss Berner, her only re
mark waa that she had been made
sick by the Poland water, which, she
said, "tasted stale," and possibly waa
not fit to drink. With only the view
of satisfying herself that the water
was in proper condition to drink she
had the contents of the bottle sent to
a chemist and had almost forgotten the
incident of January 14, when she and
Miss Berner were startled by the re
port from the chemist that the water
contained strychnine. This was th#
first cause Mrs. Stanford found for
alarm, and the police investigation wan
begun. Although satisfied that a
further investigation on their part will,
result in naught, the detectives have
not yet abandoned the strange caae
and will continue to work on it until
every possible avenue for clews haa
been traversed.

LONDON, March J6. â When Lady
Verncn, who was Miss Margaret Law
recce of New York, conies to town from
her charming place, Poynton Towers,
In Cheshire, she Invariably visits one or
other of the temperance hospitals,
the one In Hampstead Road being the
apedal object of her attention. She
makes no secret of her belief that
much of the illness from which the
Engltsh poor folk suffer Is due to
r and although she is not a fan
atic on the question of temperance
much of her spare time is quietly
spent in promoting moderation In this
direction. No one up to the present
has seen her on a temperance plat
form, but she does a lot of quiet work
for "the cause" in the vicinity of
Poynton Towers, and at her other state
ly mansion, Sudbury Park, In Derby
shire.
Lady Vernon Is exceedingly fond of
. the smaller species being her fa

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL.
Few People Know How Useful It Is i
in Preserving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char- j
coal is the safest and most efficient !
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but '
few realize its value when taken into !
the human system for the same cleans- j
lug purpose. i
Charcoal Is a remedy that the more !
you take of It the better; it is not a!
drug at all, but simply absorbs the :
eases and impurities always present In '
the etomach and Intestines and carries '
them out of the system.
Charcoal eweetens the breath after i
smoking, drinking or after eating
onions and-other odorous vegetables. <
Charcoal effectually clears and lm-
' prb\-es the complexion, it whitens the ;
teeth and further acts as a natural '
and eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the etomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal In one
form or another, but probably the best I
charcoal and the most for the money i
is In Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they ;
â¢re composed of the finest powdered i
Willow charcoal and other harmless I
Antiseptics In tablet form or rather in '
the form of large, pleasant tasting
lozengers, the charcoal being mixed
with honey.
The dally nse of these lozenges will j
Boon tell In a much Improved condition
of the general health, better complex-
ion. 6weeter breath and purer blood,
and the beauty of It is, that no pos-
sible harm can result from their con-
tinued uÂ«Â«, but on the contrary, great
benefit.
A Buffalo physician In speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I ad- j
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients suffering from gas in stomach '
and bowels, and to clear the complex-
Inn and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver is great- ,
ly benefited by the dally use of them;
they cost but twenty-five cents a box
at drug stores, and although in some
sense a patent preparation, yet I be- !
lieve I get more and better charcoal in
Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges than in any
of the ordinary charcoal tablets."

FAMOUS HYMN WRITER PASSES
HIS EIGHTIETH BIRTHDAY.
Calm Life of an Author of Sacred Songs
AUTHOR OF FAMOUS HYMN' WHO RECENTLY CELEBRATED HIS EIGHTIETH
BIRTHDAT AT HIS HOME ON THE ISLE OF WIGHT, AND A VERSE OF I
THE SACRED SONG SDKS IN* EVERT LAND.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, March 25.â Translated into
every tongue and sung the world over
wherever Christianity has penetrated,
"There's^a Friend for Little Children,"
published over forty years ago, still
remains the favorite hymn of the
young. Its author, Albert Midlane, a
hale, benign, sunny old man who cele
brated his eightieth birthday a few
tve^ks ago, lives at Newport, Isle of
Wight, where he has dwelt and labored
all his days. He has written for me a
verse of the famous hymn and has
given me some details of his life,
which will be read with interest in
America, where, though every Sunday
school is familiar with the Eong, little
is known about the singer.
He was 34 when he wrote it and the
occasion was a memorable one, for it
nearly cost him his life. All day the
words had been haunting him as he
labored at his trade, that of a tinplate
worker, but it was not until late, after
the household had retired for the night,
that he found time \.6 write them down.
He was not then in good health; his
work had been particularly hard that
day and physically he was completely
exhausted when he set about his task.
In his weakened state the nervous
.Â«train of composition taxed him se
verely, but the hymn had taken Â«uch a
grip upon him that he felt he could
not Btop until he had hammered it out
and given it permanent form on paper.
As he finished the last words he col
lapsed utterly. He was found by his
wife unconscious, his head resting on
the feebly -written page. Efforts to re-
vive him proved futile for a time and
it was feared that he was beyond re
call, but he rallied at length and grad
ually his strength was restored.
He had no idea that the simple song
which had been produced in such tra
vail was a masterpiece of its kind.
It was first published in a local Sun
day-school paper, "Good News for the
Little Ones." There it attracted the
attention of a London publisher, who
obtained permission to include it in a
collection of hymns he was issuing. It
was eet to music by Michel Watson,
and its popularity was instantaneous,
and has proved abiding.
PRAISE OF GREAT DIVINE.
Long years afterward, when Mid
lane was an old man, he chanced to
attend a service at the City Temple,
London, whose pujpit was filled by the
late Rev. Dr. Parker, then considered
the most eloquent preacher In the me
tropolis. A member of the choir sang
as a solo "There's a Friend for Little
Children" with such touching effective
ness that she was twice entreated to
repeat it. The large gathering was

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 26. 1905.
totally unaware that its author was
present. After the close of the sermon
Midlane scribbled a note, which an at
tendant took to Dr. Parker, and a
meeting between them followed. "I
would rather be the author of that
hymn," said the famous divine, "than
be the preacher of the most eloquent
sermon. My sermon would simply pen
etrate the hearts of the few, but your
hymn goes all over world."
It is only one of something like 800
Ihe has written, many of which are
| still general favorites. Most of them
1 are for the young. His personality re
veals his success in writing them. At
four score his heart is still that of a
little child. No doubts have ever dis
turbed his faith. Modern skepticism
and the higher criticism have never
shaken his implicit belief in the simple
creed of the Quaker. He is a placid,
contented, serenely happy old man,
still finding a great joy in living and
looking forward, to death, which can
not now be far off, without a vestige
of fear. Of what are accounted hard
ships he had his share in his younger
days, but they have left no traces upon
him.
His father died three months before
he was born, leaving his mother to
fight life's battle with a large family
dependent upon her. He remembers
hearing her say to him when he was
still too young to grasp the meaning
of her words, "They told me when
your dear father died that you would
be the Lord's gift to cheer and comfort
me in my widowhood." That he ful
filled that prediction is the achieve
ment of his life of which he is m(Tst
proud. When a child of 5 he began at
tending the Friends' Chapel at New
port. Too young to comprehend the
sermon he used to solace himself by
reading the hymn book. He was only
a few years older when he began writ
ing hymns himself. Because of his
mother's poverty he received but a
scanty education and when a mere
boy he had to turn breadwinner him
self. Apart from the .Bible poetry con
stituted his favorite reading, and the
Sunday-school at which he was a
teacher In his teens strengthened his
bent for devotional compositions. He
was only 19 when his first hymn was
published.
MOTHER'S INFLUENCE.
T^> his mother's influence he ascribes
all the good that he has accomplished
and all the happiness that has attend
ed his long life. No man ever revered
a mother more. He delights to talk
of her still and deeply touching are
the old man's tributes to her memory.
"Every mother," he says, "possesses
the God-placed instinct to protect and
cherish, but only a godly mother has
spiritual intelligence to lead In what
Is holy, sacred and divine. Several
times It was my great grief to see my
mother seemngly on the verge of eter
nity. A palpitation of the heart, to
which she â was subject, was sometimes
bo acute that death seemed Imminent
and her departure near. But death
she dreaded not. 'Is It death? 1 she
would say as calmly as her agitated
frame would allow. 'Is It death. I'm
not afraid.' At such seasons I could
only repeat to her her favorite and
oft-quoted lines:
Yet a little Â«nd we know
Happy Â«ntranoe will bÂ« riven.
All our Borrows left below
And earth exchanged for hearen.
Despite these seizures she lived long
years beyond the allotted span and
on each recurring birthday Midlane
used to present her with a copy of
congratulatory verses. This is the de
scription he gave me of her end:
"The sun was setting and the shades
of evening gathering. Nature's rest
fulness was also increasing upon her
and the strength which for nearly
ninety years had been so vigorous was
daily waning fast; yet ttie soul was
peaceful â so peaceful. I Interpreted
I her desire to rest on my arm, and gent
ly I removed her languid head from
her pillow and nestled it calmly there.
And, oh! that intensely loving, un
speakable gaze which met mine. It
spoke its solemn message. Brokenly
I commenced to repeat the triumphant
langauge of the Apostle, 'Thanks be
to God who giveth us the victory,' when
with her last feeble effort she en

Claim Patrons Were Duped
by Unknown Conspirators
CINCINNATI, Ohio, March 25.â The
result of a conspiracy is declared by of
ficials of the Union Savings Bank and
Trust Company of this city to be the
explanation for a run on the savings
department of that institution, which,
after having continued quietly for
about two weeks, was to-day the
means of crowding the bank with sev
eral hundred excited depositors who
failed to reach the paying teller's win
dow. One woman was knocked down
and trampled on in the rush, but it is
not believed that her injuries will
prove dangerous.
The bank has $2,500,000 in cash on
hand and nearly $8,700,000 in securities
that can immediately be converted into
cash, besides other assets to care for
its $18,700,000 deposits, and the officers
express the utmost confidence in the
outcome.
It is charged that postal cards were
1 sent to depositors of the bank advising
| the withdrawal of deposits and that
I the telephone had also been used as a
| means of giving the same advice. The
i bank officials say that they have se-
I cured some of these postal cards and

' them. Offers of more than $2,000,000 in
I cash have been made by Chicago and

but all these proffers have been de
clined with thanks.
As an indication of the view of local
financiers an offer of $600 for the stock

no stock could be had for that price,
although it was the high record of the
stock.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba. March 25. â
Sandercock and Me-Donald, highway

robbery with violence from WinniDeg

first installment of twenty-five lashes.
Mac Donald made a great uproar and
from the first stroke of the dreaded

and had to be carried to his cell.
The. first few lashes seemed to have
no appreciable effect on Sandercock,
but he soon began to groan in a man

Donald.

DAUGHTER OF SHARON
TO GO IN FOR SOCIETY
Lady Hesketh to Take a House In
London for the Coming
Season.
LONDON, March 25.â Another Amer
ican woman, who has heretofore been
little seen in London society, Lady
Hesketh, is looking out for a town
house for the season, and will prove a
welcome addition to the hospitable col
ony. She is a daughter of the late
Senator Sharon of Nevada, but since
her marriage to Sir Thomas Hesketh,
which occurred as long ago as 1880,
country life has possessed more charms
for her than the gayeties of Mayfair.
Sir Thomas owns some 15,000 acres
and two beautiful country residences,
one at Ormskirk, in Lancashire, and
the other at Towcaster, In Northamp
tonshire. So she has had abundant op
portunities to gratify her natural
tastes. Like Mrs. Frank Mackey she is
an enthusiastic follower of the hounds,
and her devotion to outdoor pastimes
doubtless accounts for the remarkable
preservation of her youthful good
looks. She is still a pretty woman, fair
and alight and a remarkably good
dresser.
That she had inherited some share of
the Sharon luck was shown recently
when she invested 25 centÃ in a lottery
at a charitable bazaar over which Lady
Cadogan presided and won a valuable
emerald and diamond ornament.
THINKS NIGHT BETTER
THAN MORNING FOR STUDY
Professor Scott of NorUi western Uni
versity Speaks in Favor of
"Midnight OH."
CHICAGO, March 25. â Dr. John A.
Scott, professor of Greek In the North
western University, addressing one of
his classes in defense of "burning the
midnight oil," has declared the great
scholars of to-day are not those who
study early in the morning, but those
who study late into the night.
"In olden days," he said, "the Per
sians congregated at daybreak to pur
sue their studies, but nowadays the
great scholars pore over their books at
night. In the morning one's eyes are
not clear, his head Is still numb from
sleep and he is in no condition for
mental work."

WHAT SULPIIUK DOES
For the Unman I .â¢.!'. in Health and
Mi m
The mention of sulphur will recall
to nÂ»eny of us the early days when our
mother's* nr.d g^rendmothers gave us
our daily doee of sulphur and mo-
lasses every spring and fa!L
It was the universal rpring and fall
"blood purifier," tonic and cure-all,
a-.)d mind you. thi* old fashioned rem-
edy was not without merit.
The Idea was good, but the remedy
waj crude and unpalatable end a
large quantity had io be taken to get
any effect.
XowadaJ's we gv. all the brnencial
effecLs cf sulphur in a palatabi 1 ?, con-
centrated form, so that a nlr. -le grain
Is far more effective th?.n a table-
spoonful of the crude sulphur. .
In n?cent years research and ex-
pertment have jiroven that the best
sulphur for medicinal use Is that ob-
tain* from Cak-ium (Calcium Sul-
phlde) end sold Sn drug: stores under
the name of Stuart's Calc'.um Wafers.
They are small chocolate coated pel-
lets and contain the active medicinal
principle of sulphur in a highly con-
centrated, effective form. !
Few people are ay/are of the value
of this form of sulphur In restoring
and malntalnlns; bodily vigor and
health; sulphur acts directly on the
liver and excretory organs and puri-
fies and enriches the blood by the
prorr.r.t elimination of waste material.
Our grandmothers knew this when
they do?"d v* with sulphur and mo-
Irisses every spring and fall, but the
crudity and impurity of ordinary
flov.ers of sulphur were often worj*
than the disease and cannct compare
with the modern concentrated prep-
arations of sulphur, of which Stuart's
Calcium Wafers is undoubtedly the
bfs-t and most widely used.
They are the natural antidote for
]jver 'ittl kMr.ey trouble* and cure
constipation and purify the blood in
n way that often surprises patient and
physician nlike.
Dr. H. M. Wllklns. while <Â»xperl-

was superior to any othT form. He

Furprised at the results obtained from

guttering from boils and pimples and

repeatedly f*en them dry up and dis-
appear in four or five days, leaving
the skin clear and smooth. Although
Stuart's Calcium Wafers is a proprie-

forms of akin disease as this remedy." 1
At any rate people who are tired of

8089 Therese McKimTV. in
Fit of Hysteric Resents
Imputations on Good Name
RAYL GETS JUDGMENT
Assailants Must Pay $299
Damages for Brutally At
tacking Him on the Street
M:.--? Th^rese MeKinery created an
exciting socne yesterday in the court
0C Justice of the Peace Van Nob
trand during the trial of the suit of
Garfteld Rayl for 1239 damages against
Frank Hanrock. Roiand Murdock, Wil
liam H. Daly aud Sol Lar.dsburg- Miss
McKinen'. in vhose account the de
fendants administered a beating to
Rayl on Davis street, became hyster
ical and threw her purse at the head
of Lar.dsburg, v.ho, aÂ« attorney for the
-c, had persisted in asking wit
:.3 that tended to be
smirch hpr reputation.
It v.as while George Ducarpe was on
the stand that Miss McKlnery ' gave
way to violent emotion, and it looked
at one time as if it would be necessary
to call a physician. Ducarpe, in reply
to LandKburg's questions, stated that
he had gone to the Larchmont lodging
house in company with Miss McKinery
on two different occasions â piece of
testimony that had been previously
denied by the young lady. No sooner
had Ducarpe given his testimony than
Mis<: McKlnery rose from her seat in
the courtroom and advanced toward
l^andsburjj, Faying:
â  k yiur head off, you con-
Mmptibto thing: I'll knock your head
V "U are trying to ruin my rt-puta
lion. All of you have lied about this,
tnd it has gone too far."
HAS TALE TO TELL.
MftM Mr-Kinery's voice rose higher
and higher, and with hi-avy sobs and a
hysterical shriek she threw her purse
at Landsburg, but the mit-sile went
vi<l<- ot tho mark. Judge Van Nostrand
immediately adjourned court, and the
plaintiff's led the now hyster
ical woman to the Judges chambers,
v hero sho soon calmed down. When
curt was resumf-d- Miss MeKinery took
the stand and asked leave to make the
following statement:
1 have been made a fool of long
enough and I do not propose to be
made a scapegoat for others. The
quarrel was not over me, but over an
other woman. The details are too dis
gusting to be told in public, but I will
tell the story to the court privately."
Judge Van NoMrand ruled tha^ the
attorneys wouid have to be present if
Miss MeKinery told her story, but to
this she would not agree.
Earlier in the trial Miss MeKinery
denied a conversation which Ducarpe
alleged he had had with her relative
to the fabrication of the testimony as
to th<- alleged attacks made by Rayl
upon her.
IHAIKS IIAMOCK'S MORTGAGE.
" It was this way," said Misp Me-
Kinery, "Ducari* saiii to Hancock:
"Call me as a witness and I will tes
tify that I saw Rayl attack Miss Me-
Kinery.'
"Hancock seemed to think he had a
mortgage on me," continued Miss Me-
Kinery. "He had frequently threat
ened to take my life and on one oc
casion he choked me. It was because
I l>;ired Hancock that I told Rayl's at
torney th;;t liajrl had attacked me,
when as a matter of fact he had not
done so."
The court gave judgment against
three of the defendants, Hancock,
Murdock and Daly lor the full amount
demanded by Rayl. Iln doing so he
p." id:
"I consider this one of the most
cowardly and dastardly assaults that
has ever come to my notice. For three
or four men to attack an unsuspecting
man is, in my opinion, not a very
action, ji ih* romplatnt had
alleged conspiracy as well as assault I
would have given judgment against all
four of th^ defendant! Tho evidence
shows that Luntfsburg took no part in
the attack, although he aided in the
plot to beat Rayl."
Martin's Estate Settled.
Judge Kerrigan yesterday signed the '
final account of Mrs. Louise W. Mar- ';

JUDGE REBUKES TYRANNY OF TRUST
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Persiflage flew thick and fast In To
lice Judge Mohan's court whllfiTl.ulÃl
Alamlno and Ballorl Ediurto, flower
peddlers, were- undergoing examina
tion on the charge of disturbing the
peace by fighting. They were arrested
Friday afternoon at Market arid
Kearny streets by Patrolmen Connolly
and Hlnrlchs, who testified that thÂ«y
bombarded each other with bunches
of fragrant blooms until their ammu
nltion was exhausted, when they r*
sorted to fisticuffs. When the police
men arrived at the scene of the conflict
the combatants were surrounded by a
great throng and bouquets of violets,
pinks, carnations and other floral
gems were swishing through the air
and lading it with mingled perfumes.
So dense was the surrounding crowd
that by the time the officers had shoul
dered their way to its center the mis
siles had ceased to soar and Signors
Alamino and Ediurto were clutched
and pummeling.
"A regular war of the roses," was
the Judge's comment.
" 'Every aft I bring you â  violets,'
hummed- Clerk Patrick Grey.'
"Yet the throwing of bouquets is
rarely consfflePed a misdemeanor either
by the thrower or the throwee," mur
mured Prosecuting Attorney Greeley.
"What started this sweet scented
row, any way?" his Honor inquired.
Signors Alamino and Ediurto held
conflicting views of the quarrel's in
ception. They were among the ven
dors fringing the sidewalk that they
transformed into a field of battle, and
Signor Alamino averred that while he
was bending over his basket selecting
a bunch of pinks for a lady his
anatomy was rudely kicked by Signor
E'liurto, the force of the propulsion
prostrating Signor Alamino atop of his
wares, thereby frightening away the
fair would-be customer and spoiling a
sale. Signor Ediurto, on the other
hand, declared that while he was
picking out a nosegay of violets for a
gentleman he was violently thrust
aÃide by Signor Alamino, who loudly
ami falsely proclaimed said violets
stale and artificially perfumed.
"Notta da kind!" exclaimed Signor
Alamino. "I'm da independ' an' he
belonga da trost. I trya ta maka da
TTioh' an' he say, 'Go 'way; you no
belonga da trost.' Den we maka da
scrap." /
Signor Alamino had the most con
vincing testimony on his side, so he
was discharged and Signor Ediurto
remanded for sentence.
Richard B. Bunker, accused of
abandoning and failing to provide for
his 19-year-old wife and two young
children, was arraigned before Judge
Cabaniss and had the case continued
till next Wednesday. It was intimated
that an amicable settlement may be
effected out of court. Mrs. Bunker is
a daughter of Horseman "Jim" Neil
and a sister of Frankie Neil, former
world's champion feather-weight pugi
list.

Mabel Francis, a 16-year-old octoroon,
taught Sunday-school in an Afro-
Americnn church until she fell Into tha
clutches of Miss Willie Buren, also
colored, who led her into crooked path
ways. The girsjwas before Judge Mo
pan for incorrigibllity, and Miss Buren
indignantly denied that she was other
than a in the case; but the
testimony showed that her adoption of
the wayward one was Inspired by less
lofty motives. The Judge opined he
would send Mabel to a reformatory,
whereupon her father hoped his Honor
would not damage her character by so
doing, to which his Honor replied that
it would be rather difficult to injure
the reputation of a girl who had dwelt
in the immoral house maintained by
Miss Buren. So to a reformatory Miss
Francis will be seat.
Francis Reid, a licensed chauffeur,
was driving his automobile at a
twelve-mile-an-hour clip when he was
overhauled and arrested by Patrolman
TuJte last Friday afternoon at Market
and Powell streets. When a facetious
attorney Inquired if the defendant had
sounded "Toot" ere he was arrested by
Tuitc the pun was Ignored by Judge
Mogan, who apparently regarded Mr.
Reid's offense as no laughing matter,
for the pronouncement was that of
guilty. At the time and place of the
arrest the speeding of any vehicle en
dangered human life and limb.
Nineteen-year-old Agnes Murphy
yearned to be an actress, and In pur
suance of that desire she interviewed
and was repulsed by every reputable
theater manager in town, because she
possessed neither the physical nor the
artistic qualifications to warrant her
ambition. Nothing daunted, however,
Bhe descended to the cheap concert
halls, and finally met a Barbary Coast
impresario who told her that while
she was amply blessed with the nat
ural charms that compel stage suc
cess, elaborate wardrobe would be re
quired to augment her magnetism be
hind the footlights. That was how
she came to be arraigned before Judge
Mogan on the charge of stealing three
gold watches and a |20 gold piece from
her father's house at 61 East Park
street, Bernal Heights. It was to equip
herself sartorially for a brilliant debut
that she robbed her parent, a reapect

indulgence of her bibulous desire, and
when Patrolman Holmes first saw her
she was the central figure of a jeer

larity, she was emitting raucous
whoops and kicking her hat high In
air. while she menaced the throng by
jabbiner at it with two long- steel skew
en* which had served to fasten the
headgear to her coiffure. When the po
liceman approached she fiercely lunged
at him with the hatpins, one clutched
in each hand; nnd so nimbly did she
maintain the attack that he was forced
to break ground and back away to
avoid being punctured. Gallantry oro
hibited him using his club, and he was
â¢\rtively sidestepping and In a quan

his aid. The enemy, however, prac
ticed fine strategy by placing her back
ajrainFt a tiratt, thus guarding against
onslaught from the rear, while she had
a Bkewer grasped in a free hand to
meet each of her opponents in front.
The odds were clearly against the offi
cers until Rkain happily bethought him

which he did by doffing his coat and
throwing it over her outstretched
hands. Before she could shake off the
garment the foe was upon her and
holding her powerless to move her
arms. The rest was easy.

BESTOWS BOON ON MINERS
PENALTIES FOR MINING FAKIRS
Posts to Guide the Prospectors on
Mineralized Deserts.
Two hlllrt of much Importance to the
l*KltltnutÂ«> mining IrnJiiHtry nt Califor
nia lihvk b#Â«Â«n nlÃiied by (Jovernor Par
ili-<- in,- pii.il Â«â¢Â«â¢â¢â¢ k und there arÂ«\ con
â¢â¢quontly, two new mining laws In
the statute* of the State. One of these
Mlkktl provisions that arc supposed to
be sufficiently wide-reaching to prevent
dealers In fraudulent mining shares
from gulling the public The other
nmki's appropriation to procure metal
lic guide-posts to place on the deserts
at California to Indicate the location
of w-118, springs and water tanks on
the desert. Both measures have re
ceived the support of State Mineralo
gist Aubury.
Swindling transactions in shares of
non-producing, non-paying or prac
tically fictitious mines have long cast
discredit upon and interfered with the
success of legitimate mining enter
prises. Some fakers have, as the im
mediate result erf their operations,
passed time In penitentiaries. Others
are still at large, Issuing prospectuses
to catch the unwary and over-credu
lous Investors and using the United
States malls to decoy money from the
pockets of the residents of distant
States.
The measure that has been signed by
Governor Pardee to protect stockhold
ers and persons dealing with corpora
tions in this State was primarily pre
pared to meet mining exigincles, but
its scope is considerably wider, as will
be seen by the text of the leading sec
tion, which is, in full, as follows:
TEXT OF MEASUREL
Section Iâ Any superintendent, director. *ec
retary, manager, agent or othÂ«r officer, of
any corporation formed or existing under the
lawe of this State, or transacting business In
the same, and any person pretending or hold
ing himself out as such superintendent, di
rector, secretary, manager, agent, or other
officer, who shall willfully subscribe, sign, ra
dorÃe, verify, or otherwise assent to the pub
lication either generally or privately, to the
stockholders or other persons dealing with
such corporation, or its stock, any untrue or
willfully and fraudulently exaggerated report,
prospectus, account, statement of operations,
value*, business, profits, expenditures or pros
pects; or other paper or document Intended to
produce or give, or having a tendency to pro
duce or give, to the shares of stock in such
corporation a greater value or less apparent
or market value than they really possess, or
with the intention of defrauding any particu
lar person or persons, or the publlo, or per
sons generally, shall be deemed guilty of a
felony, and on conviction thereof shall be pun
ished by imprisonment In State prison or a
county jail not exceeding two years, or by
fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by
both.
The application of the guide post law
is particularly limited to seven coun
ties that have mining prospects on
wild deserts. The essential provisions
of that measure are as follows:
FOR DESERT REGIONS.
Section Iâ The sum of $5000 ia hereby appro
priated from any money in the State treasury,
not otherwise appropriated, for the purpose
of procuring metallic guide posts, upon which
are to lit indicated the distance and direction
from said posts, the location of wells, springs,
or tanks of water fit for drinking purposes,
and other information of value, in the desert
sections of California, particularly in the coun
ties r.f Kern, Ventura, Los Angeles, Inyo, Riv
erside, San Bernardino and San Diego; pro
viding, however, that each of said counties
(for its own county) shall bear the expense
of the proper erection of said guide posts at
euch points in the county as may be desig
nated by the department of highways, and
shall pay all expenses attendant upon the plac
ing of said post*, as well as the expense in
curred in placing the directions above men
tioned upon said costs.
Sec. 2 â The purchase and distribution of such
posts is hereby placed under the management
and control of the department of highways of
the State of California, and it is made the
duty of Raid department of highways to des
ignate the points at which said posts shall
be placed. Said posts shall be at least ten
feet in length and shall be made of not less
than two inch nor more than three inch iron
pipe, to be set in metallic cross pieces of such
size and to be suck in the earth at euch
depth as will insure proper anchorage. Bald
posts shall have Iron cross arm* on which
shall be affixed metallic letters stating the
information mentioned in section one of this
act.
Sec. 3 â Any person removing, defacing or
in any manner Injuring s&id guide posts shall
bfi deemed guilty of a felony.
The arguments in favor of the last
quoted law were strong. In the past
few years there have been large min
eral discoveries in the desert regions of
this State. Those at Randsburg, the
vast oil measures in Kern County, the
Gem and gold-bearing areas in San
Diego County and the niter and borax
deposits in the Death Valley country
may be mentioned as among the more
prominent instances. Very likely the
deserts are as rich as any part of Cali
fornia in minerals. The latest gold
f-elentlously pledge herself to abstain
from consuming intoxicating liquors,
because an appetite inherited from
whlsky-lovlns; forebears was not to be
suppressed at will, she could assure
the court that never again would she
convey said appetite to this city.
When ft becomes uncontrollable, she
explained, a messenger will be dis
patched for the means of appeasing it,
and her tippling will be done at home.
"After serving; twenty-four hours in
the City Prison you will be at liberty
to go where you please," said *tho
Judge, "and for your own sake I woulfi
advise you to confine your future
drunks to Marin County."
Such an incorrigible 16-year-old is
Laura Murray that the management of
the Magdalen Asylum, where she has
been confined, informed Judge Mogan
that it will not again receive her. After
her dismissal from that institution she
returned to waywardness and became
the "chum" of a notoriously Immoral
woman and, at her father's request.
Patrolman P. Sullivan arrested her.
Bhe was released on probation and as
sured that she will be sent to the
County Jail if her mode of living is
not Immediately reformed.
Geber Not Yet Sentenced.
August Geber, convicted of the
murdtr of Charles Hartmann at 319
Third street last July, was up for sen
tence by Judge Dunne yesterday. His
attorney filed a motion for a new
trial on statutory rrounds and asked
for a continuance for arsruingr the
points raised In the motion. The
Judge objected to any further delay,
but finally continued the case for a
week. GÂ«ber is also waiting trial for
the murder of Georare Hartmann at
the same time and the case was also
continued for a week.

1011 Harrieo/i street, reported to the
police yesterday morning that he had
been the victim of a footpad. He said
that between 3 and 4 o'clock on Fri
day morning an unknown man took
his watch and chain and $4 6 in coin
from his pockets, after beating him.
He admitted that he was considerably
under the Influence of liquor at the
time and could not recollect just
where the assault and robbery had
been committed. j
camps In Nevada add probability to
such t>Hi*>f. To make the deserts safer
for prospectors was the aim of the
Btate Mineralogist In urging the pass
age of the guide post law.
IBT THE BROWN VALLEY.
The Grass Valley Union says that a
mining revival is due in Brown's Val
ley.
Brown* Valley ha* a "boom" In sight. At
least tbÂ» one* prosperous, bat of late almost
forgotten, old quarti mining camp seems to
b# on the threshold of a revival. Brown's
Valley was one of the earliest of camps, and
at on* time had slxty-Alx stamps dropping.
Lens than half a dozen mines made & total
production of over $2,000,000 In a compara
tively short running time, and that, too, at
what might be termed shallow depth. Liti
gation, the encountering of water and the
management of novices caused the mine* to
shut down, and excitements elsÂ«whÂ«re drew
attention away from Brown's Valley.
Of recent year* It* main reason for con
tinuing upon the map* was the faot that it
was far enough out on the stage road from
MaryÂ»v!l!e to the mountains to be a con
venient stopping place for teamsters, and also
as a poatofflce for the foothills ranchmen in a
large scope of country.
The big surface plants of th* mine* had,
meanwhile, almost disappeared leaving some
bfÂ«r dumps to mark the sites of the shafts.
Those " dumps contained a large amount of
quartz. So-called refractory or* was not milled
In the early days, but having: bÂ«en raised to
the surface from the depths of the earth, was
allowed to accumulate. Metallurgists last year
happened to hear of these damp*, and investi
gating found that they contained. treasure. As
a result the owners of the dumps were in
duced to Mil to the metallurgists and they are
now erecting a mill to treat th- ore.
The Angels Record reports concern
ing the active operations at Copper
opolis. In substance Its account is as
follows:
Copperopolis Is the scene of great
activity. About 150 men are employed
in the erection of a mammoth smelter
of the latest design, and also in the
building of a ninety-foot steel hoist,
the second one In the county. The
mine will be operated as far as possible
by electricity. The company has a
great number of men at work chop
ping wood and clearing the land, the
wood to be used in the smelter fur
naces.
The happenings customary to the
early days of nearly all mining camps
on the Pacific Coast of the United
States are noted at Goldfleld. The
town now has something like 8000 In
habitants, as estimated. Rough pine
for building purposes brings $70 per
1000 feet. Stone is quarried for build
ing material near the town, and. ia
comparatively cheap. Two banks are
In construction. The transient element
makes tbe place lively. Town lots oÂ»
the main street are sold for $5000 each.
No clear titles can be given and lot-
Jumping has taken place. Owners have
forced squatters off the land with shot
guns. Much building is In progress.
MIXRS OF FOOTHILLS.
Concerning mines in El Dorado Coun
ty, the Placervllle Nugget says:
Trie gold and silver mine at Kelsey which
was in financial difficulties a short time ngo
is ea'd to be on !ts feet again. A compressor
will be installed there shortly and surveys are
being made for a ditch to bring water from
trie American River for power purposes. At
the Red Raven mine, formerly th* Hunt and
Kathan mine, near Shingle, preparations are
being me.de to install a ten stamp mill. Th*
new hoist nn the I^arkin property, recently
bonded by Wakefleld Baker, is now in opera
tion and sinking in the shaft will be vigorously
prosecuted. William Rupley will shortly Install
a ten stamp milt on his gravel mine at Smith
Flat. This is a c-ment gravel proposition
which prospects extremely well.

WEEK'S EVENTS
AFFECT MARKET
NEW YORK, Mtxch 25â Some ten
bo depression had to be contest
: -day's market, and this was
d by the large buying of a few
:ual etocke, notably Ontario and
ten, which was rushed up in the
palings to 63$*. This did not pre
an .irregular t*>ne for the closing.
I'acific was rather heavy
.phout. rising only a small I'rac
\er iast night at any time, and
a sentimental influence on the
r.iket. New York Central was
strong feature, and it was sup
be associated with Ontario
N'estern. A number of the indus
- made advances. London's dtts<
â : Ke profits was the main
: in the heavy tone of the first
and after this influence was over
there was another reaction, due
â¢n of an unfavorable
bank statement.
The $18,000,000 Joan contracted dis
closed by the statement helped to ef
fect such a reduction in deposits as to
relieve the reserve requirement to the
extent of nearly $6,000,000, so that in
spite of the loss in cash of $4,618,000,
whjch was considerably in excess of
c expectation, the margin of the surplus
Â»â¢&? expanded to the extent of $1,- '
825,350. The events of the week afford
i ground for confidence that even with
ruther loan contraction by the banks
resources will be found in the foreign '
exchange market* and in trust com- I
pany offerings to meet loan require- i
< ments. ;
It Is suggested that the present heavy i
outward movement to foreign markets â¢
of -securities represents holdings accu- !
mulated in the early stage of the mar- !
ket advance by foreigners and which
have been- held since with the pro- â¢
ceeds of loans in this market. The ;
loans are now being paid off and the i
securities taken abroad to be held In (
cheaper foreign markets. It is said by i
authorities in the exchange market that i
this process of delayed payment on i
foreign purchases of securities Is the 1
principal factor in the present sharp |
downward tendency in the price of for
eign exchange. London discounts hard
ened to-day and the sterling rate de
clined at Berlin.
Total sales of bonds, par value, $2 -
â MM. "
Stocks have been freely liquidated
during the past week and the decline
in prioea, which was extended by the
manipulative efforts of the bears,
caused the uncovering of stop-loss or- 'â â 
ders and forced offerings up on the
i -narket by impairment of margins. The
price level was considerably lowered at i
times, but the haste with which the
bears covered their short contracts ',
helped to restore a part of the losses. â 
The reaction was regarded with com
placence as normal after the extent to
which these previous rises had run !
continuously and the shaking out of
weak accounts, held for purely specu
lative purposes, was felt to add to the
health and soundness of the market.
The rectification of some of the ex
cesses In the price level which had re-
Mttei from the unbridled enthusiasm
of the speculative temper on the ad
vance was accomplished with satisfac- !
lion.
A quieting for stocks at this season
i ? the year Is. according to precedent,
i wing principally to the reasonable de
mands on the New York money market
for the spring requirements of the in
terior trade. Reserves which have been
accumulated in New York banks and
which hare been placed on call for use
la the stock market to avoid keeping
them idle and unprofitable in bank de
posits are sure to be reduced and
; axed in active use In the currents of
trade.

REIMBURSE A PASSENGER
Court Holds Corporation Is Liable for
Jewels Worth $6988 Lost
by Woman.
NEW YORK, March 25. â That the
Atlantic Transport Company must pay
to Mrs. Frances M. Barnes $6988 to
reimburse her for the value of jewels
which she alleged were stolen from
her stateroom on board the steamship
Minnetonka has been decided by
United States Commissioner Herbert
Green. The decision will be re
viewed by Judge Adams of the United
States Court, who, however, has al
ready declared that the steamship
company is liable.
Mrs. Barn<?s alleged that while
crossing the ocean on the Minnetonka
last November a man dressed in tha
uniform of a ship's steward burst into
her stateroom, seized a bag contain
ing the jewelry and disappeared. The
Atlantic Transport Company contend
ed that the form of ticket bought by
Mrs. Barnes exempted it from liability
for loss arising from theft.
A temperature of 4000 degrees or

Give Nature a Chance
BY USING â
Newbro's
Herpicide
â¢ The ORIGINAL remedy that "kills the dandruff germ."
It destroys the tiny vegetable growth in the sebaceous
glands of the' scalp, after which the hair will grow as nature
intended. Don't wait until it is too late, for chronic bald-
ness is incurable.
The microbe of dandruff and baldness makes the hair
dull, brittle and lusterless. It fills the hair with dandruff and
causes itching of the scalp. Later it chokes the very life
out of the hair and causes it to fall. Save it with NEW-
BRO'S HERPICIDE. Extraordinary results follow its use.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 26, 1905.
INTERESTING ADDRESS MADE
BY ADVERTISING EXPERT.
Relations of the Mer
chant and News
| paper Considered.
C H, House Points
Out Facts Impor
tant to Both.
At the recent banquet given at the i
EL Francis Hotel by the Ad Club of i
San Francisco to the retailers of the i
city the following address on "Adver- !
Using aa Seen by the Newspapers" was
delivered by C. H. House, advertising
manager of The Call:
"The question of 'Advertising as
Seen by the Newspaper" may, it seem*
to me, be most readily answered by
defining the way a newspaper regards i
advertisers â its attitude tbward them '
and their interests. Of course, all pa- |
pers regard advertising favorably and '
even cheerfully if it makes its appear
ance in their own columns. To pro- '.
duce a condition that will in as large '
a measure as is reasonably possible
contribute to that end seems to be the
point aimed at In the subject assigned I
to me.
'The relation between the news
paper and the advertiser is intimately I
joined. Each is essential to the other.
The newspaper is the link between the ;
merchant and the public and is at once i
the most important instrument of pub- j
licity for the merchant's wares.
"A cordial relation therefore be- |
tween the publisher and merchant !
should be fostered and all reasonable i
deferences made to maintain this !
"entente cordiale.' Community of in- j
terest should produce cordiality of in- |
tercourse.
"The newspaper's need of the mer- i
chant is constant, and no paper may ;
become so strong as to be justified in ;
assuming an arrogant or over eelf-suf- j
ficient attitude toward its patrons
without eventual harm to itself. A',
strong paper may always be stronger, '
and a less strong paper strengthened
by a liberal construction of the laws
of courtesy and consideration.
"A breach of these rules continu- i
ously indulged In will plant the seed of j
dislike and unfriendliness that upon !
future and favorable occasion will not \
be slow to manifest itself in the with- ;
drawal of patronage and the Indus- '
trious wielding of the hammer in no
uncertain manner.
"A .well managed paper will see to
It that the same courte=y that char- j
acterizes the heads of the paper must
be exhibited in every department.
"To a great extent the attitude of !
the manager will be simulated by '
subordinates. It is not an unusual :
thing to see the whole working force i
of a paper consistently emulate the j
manner of those in authority. You <
probably all have experienced the an- j
noyance of contact with officious !
counter men whose pose Is amplified j
on a more magniti- nt scale when you
have come in coii.uct with the au
thority beyond them. No advertiser
should ever be subjected to humilia
tion by the offensive or inattentive
treatment of a newspaper employe.
Competent and obliging men should !
be at the head of the various mechan- j
ical departments, for they may great
ly contribute to the satisfactory rela
tions between publisher and merchant.
"In preserving the cordiality be
tween merchant and paper the fine
discrimination between independence i
and arrogance on the part of the pub- j
lisher must not be lost sight of. A
marked degree of independence must i
be maintained, as no more sorry fig- j
ure can be exhibited than that of a i
paper sycophantic and groveling be- |
fore the material interest that it
would serve.
"Common consent has placed the
newspaper upon an elevated pedestal
and it is bound to emulate its reputa
tion, though often falling far short of
the attainment.
'A paper must have a definite pol
icy of furnishing the news and, ex
cept in unusual circumstances, the
merchant should not expect the policy
of the paper to be violated by the
suppression of facts which, in the j
judgment of the editor, the people !
have a right to know. Many people {
seem to feel that the purchase of ad
vertising space buys immunity from
criticism or notoriety no matter how
flagrant their offense.
"The newspaper is primarily a com
mercial proposition and cannot be run
upon sentimental lines, as many pro
fess to believe it should be, and yet
on its moral side U has a responsibil
ity by virtue of its vast influence that
inheres to no other commercial enter
prise.
"Its commercial instinct to make
money is stronger in the paper of to
day than ever in the history of jour
nalism, but in that respect it is proba
bly not in advance of the spirit that
characterizes the age, and is manifest
in every avenue of human endeavor.
"Its own success hinges upon the
; success of its advertisers and it must
make their-advertising pay if it would
retain the business that it has and ex
tend the scope of Its patronage.
"It must aim constantly toward
that attitude that years ago was
strongly impressed upon my mind by
one of our leading merchants when I
first undertook to solicit business. He
remarked to me then "that if the
newspapers would give more con
sideration and study to the interests
of the advertiser and less to the bare
contemplation of their cash drawers,
! advertising would pay better." As
i years have passed I have seen the
j newspapers display a more liberal
spirit and evince a greater considera
tion for what is happening to the
other fellow's cash drawer.
"I have paid that the papers have
j made concessions in the interests of
i the advertiser. It is hard even for
j the newspapers, enterprising though
! they may claim to be, to overturn tra
1 ditions. and particularly those that
I have been productive of income; yet
I we have seen the day pass when papers
' have contended for an increased price
for breaking a column rule, a regula- j
tion that seems to have been justified
by two reasons: the first, because it
was within their power to .charge for
it, and the second, being double
column the ad presenteq a stronger
and more attractive appearance, and
In consequence was worth more to
the advertiser. A most trivial and
senseless argument. Why should not
the advertiser be encouraged to arrange
hts copy and space so that it will pro
duce the most effective results? The
absurdity of this stand is heightened
when, In breaking the column rule,
the space was almost Invariably in
creased and the revenue to the paper
relatively larger.
"The inauguration of art depart
ments by the papers has been of mate
rial advantage to the advertiser.
They have assumed the expense of

maklnjc the cuts, if furnished with
drawings, .and no one will deny the
importance of Illustration in the mod
ern ad. Its power to impart specific
inform^|lon and to promote an effect
beyondi'the power of suggestion of
cold type is self-evident.
"The newspaper Is no doubt often
considered 'tight' in its seeming lack
of liberality in the granting of free
notices, jet advertisers should not be
offended because the privilege Is not
frequently conceded. There are two
substantial grounds for its refusai:
First, the advertiser* is presumed to
have had value received for the space
he buys a 'quid pro quo.' The paper
must regard Its space as So much mer
chandise, and only in the Orient is it
a commercial practice after a sale has
been made to throw in an extra quan
tity' to proclaim full measure. Sec
ondlj% if free notices were indiscrimi
nately Indulged in a minimum of value
would result (tor no discrimination be
tween advertisers could be made) and
a paper flooded with bogus news items
would soon experience a reaction â a de
crease in subscriptions directly detri
mental to the one lookfog for the bene
fit. Too great frequency of free no
tices would make them commonplace
and ineffective.
"Many merchants hold unorthodox
opinions of what constitutes news. His
departure on an Eastern trip is news
and is entitled to a place In the paper's
columns, but an extended description of
the character and quantity of the mer
chandise he expects to return with is
news far better adapted to his adver
tising space. The merchant who is
about to alter his premises or to re
place his fixtures may fancy all the
world is breathlessly waiting to learn
of it, and yet were the whole paper
composed of such Information his
would be the first subscription to be
stopped Ido not wiÃh it to be under
stood, however, that some courtesy of
the sort should not be shown adver
tisers; a reasonable degree should, and
in my judgment the papers of San
Francisco are liberal in this respect.
"The restrictions of these papers
upon the character of type and cuts
j used and the size that ads may oc-
I cupy are few. Full varieties of the
latest faces of type are always replac
ing worn and obsolete fonts, and few
papers are more attractive In their en
tire typographical appearance than
those of San Francisco.
"Cuts and borders of reasonable
blackness are permitted. Certain pa
pers of the Bast, notably those of
Washington, D. C, require the use of
I open-face type, permitting a black face
only upon the payment of a double
price for lines so run. The New York
Herald permits only one face, and that

Late Actual Status of
Her Hungarian Admirer
CLEVELAND, March 25.â Judge
Beacom of the Common Pleas Court
to-day planted a divorce to Mme.
Tackacs de Kis Joka on the ground of
extreme cruelty.
The plaintiff, formerly Mis* Hart,
is the daughter of a wealthy manufac
turer of this city. While traveling in
Europe with her parents she met
Count Tackacs de Kis Joka, a Hun
garian nobleman of Budapest, and the
couple were married after a brief
courtship. The young wife, according
to her statement, soon discovered that
her husband was heavily involved
financially and without means. She
declared that the nobleman had will
fully deceived her as to his standing,
socially and financially. Through mis
representations, she said, she was in
duced to sign notes for her husband's
creditors, aggregating a large sum.
Later she left her husband and came
here. The Count followed and attempt
ed a reconciliation, in which he was
unsuccessful. Mme. Tackacs de Kis
Joka filed a petition in voluntary bank
ruptcy and was declared a bankrupt
by the United States court. She then
applied for a divorce, which was grant
ed to-day.
BELIEVE ROCKEFELLER

Pupils of Chicago College Think Oil
Magnate Will Give School
$50,000,000.
CHICAGO, March 25.â That John D.
Rockefeller will provide a big endow
ment for the University of Chicago is
the belief of a majority of the students
at the school. They point to the first
letter ever received v the school from
its founder which arrived last night,
as substantiation of the hopes which
all entertain. Dr. Harper's most cher
ished hope it Is known was to see the
university endowed with $50,000,000.
open to the point of indistinctness.
The Chicago Daily News, owned by
Victor Lawson, and probably the best
paying newspaper in the United States,
with a daily circulation of 350,000. re
stricts the space an ad may occupy.
I am told five columns full on Fridays
is the limit, and for the reason that
the proprietor refuses to crowd out
news" to crowd In advertising. I know
of no such restraint upon advertisers
here In San Francisco.
"In regard to position of ads, the
merchant frequently asks more than
the paper can reasonably grant. A
paper has only a given number of po
sitions, and, as an illustration, I am
reminded of a dinner given at a cheap
boarding-house, made famous by the
alleged humorous publications. The
landlady, while carving an attenuated
turkey, was besought by all the board
ers for a leg each. She paused In her
Jiu jitsu exercise and remarked, 'Gen
tlemen, do you suppose I am carving
a centipede?' So all may not have the
choicest positions at the same time,
but, with one exception, the papers of
San Francisco exert themselves to
place their advertising to the best pos
sible advantage.
"The value of position is constantly
recognized. To a degree the attention
of the reader must be waylaid. The
advertisement must be intrusive. There
is undoubtedly a vast number of peo
ple whose only avenue of information
upon the everyday affairs of their life
is through the columns of the daily
paper. Still another class who I am
convinced religiously study advertis
ing, notably, women. These do not
need to be sandbagged into insensibil
ity before they awaken to the con
sciousness that advertising matter is
intended for them, but the remaining
element of busy business men, the
careless and the indifferent, must be
taken by the ear and be made to sit
up and take notice. It is In their path
that the obstruction must be laid, and
conspicuous position will go far to
wSTd compelling attention.
"Newspaper conditions in San Fran
cisco are not ideal, and yet I venture
the statement that nowhere in the
United States, population and patron
age considered, are better papers from
the standpoint of news, local and tele
graphic, pictorially and typographi
cally, to be found than right here in
San Francisco, and I do not believe
a city exists where a more cordial feel-
Ing obtains between merchant and
publisher. Gentlemen, I trust this
happy condition may long exist."

MAKES BIG HIT
WITH ROUVIER
French Premier Approves
Plan to Establish Franco-

LIKES YANKEE SYSTEM
Work of United States Gov
ernment in the Philippines
Praised by an Authority
PARIS, March 25.â Premier Rouvler
strongly approved the project to estab
lish a Franco- American financial Insti
tution In Paris during a recent conver
sation with James Bpeyer of Speyer St
Co. of New York. The Premier had
previously shown admiration for Amer
ican finances as the result of the fol
lowing Incident, heretofore unknown:
During the height of the religious
agitation French rentes suffered a se
rious decline, causing M. Rouvler, who
then was Minister of Finance, serious
anxiety. At this juncture the heads
of two leading American insurance
companies happened to be In Paris, and
It waa decided that the capitalists
should take four millions of rentes.
Their agents entered the Bourse and
made the purchase In a single day. ThÂ«
effect was magical. Rentes became
steady and then rose. M. Rouvier'i
prestige was regained asd his admira
tion for the power of American funds
was established. Therefore ho gave the
friendliest reception to 9 peyer's pro
ject, to establish a Franco-American
bank here, one purpose* of whicfe was
to place the new Mexican loan upon
the French market.
Minister of Colonies Clamentsl has
received a confidential report concern
ing the progress and status of the
Philippine Islands and the Island of
Java. The report is by Gorernor Gen
eral La Mothe of Cochin China, who Is
a recognized authority on colonial ad
ministration. Although ths report Is
not available. Governor Ls> Mothe In
an interview shows that It is a highly
favorable tribute to American control
of the Philippines.
"My Government charged mÂ«," he
said, "to thoroughly investigate the
economic and political conditions In the
Philippines and Java. I spent four
months In the Philippines studying the
result of American control. I was
struck by the enormous prestige made
In such a comparatively brief period.
This has been greater during the last
four years than during the 350 years
preceding the American occupation.
The natives are being educated, are re
ceiving the benefits of municipal and
provincial liberty and are rapidly ac
quiring the spirit of republican institu
tions."

ARMY CAPTAIN
FIGHTS DEBTS
Amos H. Martin Has Battle
With Bad Luck That May
End in Court-3lartial
I -'EARS YELLOW PERIL
( liinese Creditor Takes His j
Chum to Headquarters I
and Uncle Sam Is Wroth;
The old adage that troubles never
come singly has been fully exemplified
in the affairs of Captain Amos H. Mar
tin of the Fourteenth United States
Infantry, who arrived at the Occidental
Hotel Friday from the East, where a
trial by court-martial has been de
manding his attention for the past two
months. Yesterday the officer was to
have departed for Vancouver Bar
racks, Wash., but Just as he was say-
Ing adieu to his army friends he re
ceived a message from Washington
countermanding his previous orders
and instructing him to remain in San
Francisco until further orders.
Accompanying the message was one
to the effect that Captain Martin has
again subjected himself to army in
quiry through a financial affair with a
Chinese merchant. The Chinese, from
what could be interpreted from the
message from Washington, advanced
the captain $200 while the latter was
serving in the Philippines and failing
to secure the return of hie money for
warded the matter to Washington,
with the result that the officer haa
been detained here pending an investi
gation.
When seen la6t night Captain Martin
declined to discuss his troubles, but his
demeanor showed plainly that he was
greatly distressed over the unexpected
orders from headquarters and the wor
ried look on the countenance of his
handsome wife was sufficient evidence
that she, too, is sharing her husband's
burden. It was reported yesterday aft
ernoon that Captain Martin had nego
tiated a loan from a local money lender
and forwarded the amount of his in
debtedness to the Chinese merchant in
the Philippines, but this story was de
r.ied by one of the captains friends,
who said:
"1 know positively that Captain Mar
tin has not forwtrded any money to
Manila and 1 doubt if he will try to
make any settlement until the matter
has been inquired into by the army of
ficials,* who will probably subject him
to a formal inquiry. He has Just got
through a court-martial, during which
his pay has been tied up."
Captain Martin is one of the best
known officers in the army, who served
with distinction through the Spanish-
American war in Cuba and afterward
ir. the Philippines. Shortly before his
return from the Philippines four ;
months ago he was ordered home for
court-martial on charges of having
duplicated .his pay accounts. He was
tried at Fort Rochell and acquitted of :
the main charge, but was found guilty
of conduct prejudicial to army dis- i
cipline, In having been careless with
his accounts and for thl6 offense he j
was deprived of twenty files in his ;
ranking as a line officer. A week ago ;
he was ordered to Vancouver Bar
ftvekÃ, whither the Fourteenth In- i
fantry Us now bound from the Philip
pines on the Sheridan.
During the progress of his trial in
the East Captain Martin's wife and
her child have been livirfer at the Occi
dental and it was for the purpose of
joining them that he made a round
about trip to Vancouver Barracks by
way of San Francisco.
WANTS CHANNEL STREET
OBSTRUCTIONS REMOVED
Commissioner of Public Works
Aigeltinger has not given up all hope
in his efforts to have a roadway built
along Channel street, from Fourth to
Sixth, despite the refusal of the Har
bor Commissioners to aid in the pro
ject. The Harbor Commissioners
claim that to give up any portion of
the roadway would destroy the rev
enue from the wharf. Aigeltinger was
advised yesterday by Chief Street Dep
uty Donovan that the strip of land
claimed by the Harbor Commissioners
as State property belongs to the city
under a Supreme Court decision af
fecting Channel-street lands.
If that is so. thoi the city could im
prove the roadway on its own account, i
Aigeltinger will look into the matter
further before taking any definite ac- !
tion. In the meantime he will have '
another conference with the Harbor i
Commissioners to see if some agree- ;
ment cannot be reached. If the land
belongs to the city then the Commis
sioners have no jurisdiction over it.
and the State should pay the city
rental for the portion utilized as a
wharf.
As a preliminary to the proposed
improvement Aigeltinger ordered no
tices sent to the Pacific Improvement
Company to remove all obstructions
in the way of lumber and other ma
terial standing in the roadway of
Channel street. Aigeltinger hopes by
this means to bring the matter to an
APVEKTISEMKyrS.
Uricsol,
the only cure for
Rheumatism^
If you are suffering from rheuma-
tism there is a chance for you to be-
come absolutely cured. You may
cure yourself and do it quickly if you
â will lay : side your prejudice and
skepticism.
Every San Francisco druggist sells
Uricsol, the well-known remedy, and
we hereby authorize them to guaran-
tee a cure.
Uricsol cures ' rheumatism in the
only possible way it can be cured.
Uric Acid and Urates arc the cause
of Rheumatism. These are "deposited
in the tissues, blood vessels and joints
of the body.
: These deposits must be dissolved
and eliminated from the system be-
fore a cure can be accomplished.
Uricsol is a solvent of these and I
tones up the system, stimulates the
kidneys, liver and bowels . and thus
drives I them from ' the system. '
Uricsol ;is harmless, and no injuri- 'â 
ous results ; can possibly come to any
part of your body. - ' '

HIS PEN THE SORT
THAT EVES WILD
BEASTS FANCY.
ERNEST THOMPSON SETON WHO
WILL GIVE A COURSE OF LEC
TURES IN THIS CITY.
Magazine readers, and the school
children especially, who have read with
delight articles from the pen of Ernest
Thompson Seton, as well as those who
have read his books, will be pleased to
hear that he will be heard in five Illus
trated lectures at Lyric Hall next Fri
day and Saturday, March 31 and
April 1.
Ernest Thompson Seton is known to
many persons as a brilliant writer of
animal stories, and he is also a man of
many accomplishments. As an artist
he stands without a peer in depicting
with pen and brush characteristics o/
the wild animal. Many of his paintings
have been awarded first prizes in the
great art exhibits of the world.
Following are the hours and subjects
of his talks: Friday afternoon, at 3:30,
"Wild Animals I Have Known"; Fri
day evening, at 8:15, "Wild Animals at
Home"; Saturday morning, at 11
o'clock, "The Indian as I Know Him";
Saturday afternoon, at 2:30, "The Per
sonality of Wild Animals"; Saturday
evening, at 8:15, "New Adventures of
Animal Friends." Prices will be popu
lar, ranging from 50 cents to $1, while
transferable seats for four lectures, ex
cluding Saturday morning, will be
$1 50, $2 25 and ?3. Seats for the sea
son will be on sale at Sherman, Clay &
Co.'s Monday and Tuesday, after which
reservations for the separate lectures
may be obtained.
COMMISSIONERS ABOLISH
LEAVE OF ABSENCE RULE
Firemen Who Accept Appointment as
Policemen Must Resign From
Fire Department.
The Fire Commission decided yes
terday to grant no more leaves of ab
sence to firemen who have passed the
civil service examination for police
men and who accept the latter po
sition's. Heretofore it has been the
custom to allow firemen ninety days'
leave pending the outcome of their
probationary appointment as police
men.
The commission accepted the resig
nations of D. W. Moriarity, hoseman
of Engine Xo. ]2, and George E.
Dunn, hoseman of Engine No. 30.
John Daly and James A. Loretto
were appointed hosemen from the
civil service list, subject to assign.
ment by Chief Sullivan.
John Barry, engineer of Engine
Company No. 1, and F. L. Stahl, hose
man of the same company, were dis
missed from the department after a
public trial. Barry was charged with
leaving his engine house without per
mission and as it was his second of
fense in three months he lost his place.
Stahl was < ha.rged with disobedience
of orders, neglect of duty and incom
petency. On March 14 at a fire at
Broadway wharf Stahl was handling
the hose with another man and left
his post of duty and could assign no
good reason for his act.
The commission ordered that the
vacations of members of the Fire De
partment shall begin from April 1.
One man at a time from each com
pany will be given fifteen days' va
cation.
The commission ordered a letter of
thanks sent to Mrs. Samuel Rainey
for her gift of $2000 to found a medal
fund for brave firemen in honor of her
late husband.
SAN FRANCISCO POSTOFFICE
IS TRYING NEW SCHEME
Third and Fourth Class Packages May
Be Registered Without Return
Card.
The Postofflce Department has for
several weeks been trying the experi
ment of sending single third and
fourth ' class registered parcels in
registry package envelopes unaccom
panied by the usual gray card. The
experiments were made in Baltimore,
Brooklyn, Chicago, Cincinnati and De
troit.
The San Francisco office immedi
ately applied for permission to send
third and fourth class matter under
regular package tags without the ad
dress to office of destination, but this
was refused, as the postofflce had un
der advisement a form of tag envelope
which would make it unnecessary to
have an address on the tag.
At the same time permission was
granted the San Francisco office to
take advantage of the experiment al
lowed the above named Eastern cities
and to report on its efficiency in the
course of a few weeks.
OCEAN VOYAGE IMPROVES
SECRETARY HAY'S HEALTH
PONTA DEL, GADA, Azore Isl
ands, March 25. â The White Star line
steamship Cretic, which sailed from
New York March 18 for Naples, with
Secretary of State Hay and Mrs. Hay
on board, arrived here at 4 p. m. to
day. When questioned concerning his
health the Secretary said he was feel

comfortable trip.
WIFE AND BABE
ARE HIS EXCUSE
To Keep Them From Star
vation Mitchell Says He
Became a Bold Footpad
COULD NOT GET WORK
For Two Months Boy Hus
band Tramps Streets Seek
ing Support for Girl Wife
"When 1 had tramped the streets for
two months looking, for work, and my
wife and little baby were starving, in
my desperate search for something to
pawn, I came across a revolver I had
brought with me from Texas. As I
left the house the idea of robbery
fleshed across my mind and continually
haunted me until I committed the
crime."
This was the statement of Otto Z.
Mitchell, the young footpad arrested
at Hayes and Ashbury streets for a
hoid-up that was certain of failure be
cause of its crudeness. Mitchell stood
behind the bars of a cell at the City
Prison and told of the hard luck that
led him to commit the desperate crime.
He was scarcely more than twenty
when he married the frail little woman
three years,- ago; she was sixteen.
Mitchell then set out for Los Angeles
to make his living at his trade of
jeweler. While there the little one was
born and the young father worked
hard to support his family. Prospects
of better wages brought him to San
Francisco six months ago. Here he
worked for four months until trade be
came dull and he lost his position.
Persistent hard luck dogged him And
the little money he had saved drifted
away on the tide of adversity. The
little baby, then two years old, thrust
a point of a pair of scissors in Its eye,
destroying the sight and creating a
doctor's bill too large to pay. The
desperate young father tramped the
streets for work, frequently encouraged
by being told to call again, but only to
be disappointed.
Friendless and alone, the only friend
that came to the Httle family "was a
neighboring blacksmith who gave them
all he had, fifteen cents- On this the
family existed two days. With the baby
crying for food and the wife's face
pale, Mitchell found the revolver, and
the thought of robbery suggested itself.
That same night he was in the City
Prison charged with highway robbery.
The wife, a girl in years and frail in
appearance, is a constant visitor at the
prison, but does not realize the gravity
of her boy husband's offense. One
sympathetic visitor at the prison left
$5 for the young wife, but refused to
give his name to Sergeant Bidwill.
Meanwhile Mitchell awaits his first ap
pearance in court with a resolution and
regret for the trouble he has caused
his girl wife.

OFFICER KILLS
UNKNOWN MAN
Opens Fire With Shotgun on
Stranger Who Murderously
Assaulted Him With Rifle
ACTED IN SELF DEFENSE
Weapon Used by Victim of
Duel Said to Have Been
Stolen by Him on Tuesday
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call
SAN JOSE, March 2u.â An unknown
man was killed at Coyote, ten mile*
south of this city, this evening by Con
stable Lucas Patron, who was attempt
ing to arrest him. The stranger, who
is believed to be a Chilean, stole a rifle
from a woodchopper's camp in the ,Cal
averas Valley last Tuesday and inaug
urated a reign of terror among the
ranchers in the eastern foothills. He
called at the home of A. D. Rice, on
the Monterey road, this morning and
asked for food. Mrs. Rice gave him
food, but he was not satisfied, and,
rifle in hand, entered the house and
helped himself to what was on the
breakfast table, to which the woman
and her children were about to sit
down. When they remonstrated he
threatened to kill them. After he had
left the house Mrs. Rice notified the
Sheriff's office and Deputy Sheriff
Starbird and Constable Patron of Ma
drone started out to arrest him. They
soon came across his trail and the orti
cers separated to make his capture cer
tain.
Constable Patron learned at Stevens
store at Coyote that the man had been
there a short time before and had pur
chased 15 cents' worth of cheese and
crackers. VT. A. Beckwith, a farmer,
who was present at the time, took the
officer in his buggy and started after
the man. He was found a short dis
tance away, sitting by a telegraph pole.
Patron was armed with a shotgun and
revolver. When opposite the unknown
Patron got out of the buggy, where
upon the man jumped behind a tele
graph pole and began shooting at the
officer. Patron had a pistol in his hand,
but seeing that he could not use it to
advantage he opened fire with a re
peating shotgun.
Patron fired four shots, the iast one
hitting the man in the left side. The
unknown fired six shots. He lived
about ten minutes after being shot.
Patron's revolver was accidentally dis
charged when he was placing it in his
pocket and he received a flesh wound
in the thigh.
The deceased is about 50 years of age,
5 feet 3 inches tall, with black beard.
He wore a yellow sweater, with jumper
and overalls. Nothing is known of him
here.
A coroner's jury this evening return
ed a verdict of death from a gunshot
wound while resisting an officer.

GRAPE-XUTS.
IT'S FOOD -
That Restores and Makes Health Pos-
sible.
There are stomach racialists as well '
he eye and ear and other specialists.
One of these told a young lady of
New Brunswick, N. J., to quit medi-
cines and eat Orape-Nuts. She says:
"For about 12 months I suffered se-
verely with gastritis. I was unable to
retain much Â«f anything on my stom-
ach, and consequently was compelled
to give up my occupation. I took quan-
tities of medicine, and had an idea I
was dieting, but I continued to suffer,
and soon lost 15 pounds in weight. I
was depressed in spirits and lost Inter-
est in everything generally. My mind
was so affected that it was impossible
to become interested in even the light-
est reading matter:
"After Buffering for months I decid-
ed to go to a stomach specialist. He
put me on Grape-Nuts and nay health
began to improve immediately. It was
the keynote of a new life. I found that
I had been eating too much starchy
food which I did not digest, and that
the cereals which I had tried had been
too heavy. I soon proved that It Is not
the Quantity of food that one eats, but
the quality.
"In a few weeks I . was able to go
back to my old business of doing cler-
ical work. I have continued to eat
Grape-Nifts for both the morning and
evening meaL I wake in the morn-
ing with a clear mind and feel rested.
I regained my lost weight in a short
time. I am well aid happy again and
owe it to Orape-Nuts." Name given by

CARRIE SWAIN
FAILS IN SUIT
Paris Courts Decide That
Former Actress Is Not
Wife of Frank Gardner
XO RKrHT TO FORTI T XE
Woman's Stage Career Began
in This City and Man Is
Known as Mine Promoter
The courts of Paris have decided in
favor of Fnmk Gardner, the million
aire turfman and mining speculator, !
in the suit of Carrie Swain, once an
actress, to establish that he was for her
legal husband and to obtain a provi
sion of 1200.000 or 11000 a month all-*
mony. The fight between the two is
of interest in this part of the world
because they are well known here.
Carrie Swain began her stage career at
the old Bush-street Theater in San
Francisco, achieving a big reputation
In playing the part of Cad in "Cad the
Tomboy." Her brother, W. J. Wisler,
Ftill resides in this city, his home be
ing at 183S Oak street.
Gardner was a prominent character
in local racing circles in years gone
by, but he came most prominently into
public notice as promoter of the Cop
per King Mining Company, that ex
ploited an alleged copper name in
Fresno County, that brought discom
fiture to the Ixmdon Investors instead
of dividends.
The French courts held that Carrie
Swain never was the wife of Gardner,
and that she has no right to bear his
name. Announcement of the finding
wag made by the procurator and a
verdict setting forth in detail the con
clusions of the Paris Judicial mind will
be forthcoming within a fortnight.
Gardner's former American the
atrical connections and his later pa
tronage of the turf make the case one
of widespread Interest. On February
S, 7 902, Gardner was married to Mile.
Broulllet, a beautiful French woman,
and it was this move that prompted
Carrie Swain to take steps to prove the
validity of her" marriage claim. Mile.
Broulllet was a protege of Miss Swain,
who introduced her to Gardner.
MET WOMAN HERE.
Gardner first took the matrimonial
dip In partnership with Annie Graham,
an actress, who came Into the life of
Gardner when he was in Philadelphia
a score of years ago directing some
theatrical ventures there. It was fif
teen years ago when he first met Car
rie Swain, then playing the start part
in "Cad the Tomboy" at the old Bueh
street Theater.
Gardner fell deeply In love with '
Carrie, and he followed her to Aus- '
tralla, leaving his wife and three chil
dren to struggle on as best they could
in Philadelphia- Annie Graham-Gard- j
ncr shortly afterward went to San j
Francisco with the avowed intention â 
of following her husband to the ends ;
of the earth.
They were about to sail for Aus- ;
tralia when the purser, one Sutton, a I
friend of Gardner, cabled to him that 1
his family were on Â«is trail â sailing. I
Gardner and Carrie Swain took the j
next steamship from Australia to i
England, and then for a long time
Gardner dropped out of the public â 
eye. It has been since said that the i
fortune of his companion was the
foundation of the fortune that Gard
ner later accumulated.
About seven years ago Gardner ap- '
peared in Fresno County as the owner
of the Copper King mine. For this
property he is said to have paid $25,
000. A New York drug clerk who had ,
studied metallurgy during idle mo
ments behind the counter of a Fifth
avenue drugstore was found in Den- ;
ver and engaged by Gardner as an ex- '
pert.
It was upon the reports of the drug
clerk that Gardner went to London
and organized a powerful English syn- ;
dicate. Sir Christopher Furniss, ship
builder and member of Parliament, is ;
said to have put in $500,000. Gardner
received f 1.250,000 in cash and $225,- ;
000 In stock. Soon after the company
was floated the stock jumped from $5
to $10 a share.
COPPER MINE STOCK INFLATED. !
Gardner asked for $500,000 more
from the English investors to carry on
the operation of the mine, but they, 'â 
â â  becoming suspicious, refused to ante. :
The Copper King mine was abandoned ;
December 19, 1902, an investigation;
having revealed the sad truth of its
inflated value.
Gardner and Carrie Swain then ;
shifted to Paris. Their extravagant
manner of living became international \
gossip. The former actress wore dia- j
; monds that cost $80,000. She was tak
! Ing vocal lessons of Mme. Marches!,
and the story goes that when she
made the acquaintance of a poor girl i
'â â  working in a bazaar It was the dls- j
'. covery of her successor in the afTec- t
' tions of Gardner. Mile. Brouillet soon !
' jjot a firm place in the household and
there came an Immediate estrange
! ment between Carrie Swain and her
young protege. All this time Carrie
was widely known as Mrs. Gardner,
and when she and the millionaire
ceased to be seen together in public
I Cora Urauhart Potter was said to
have been the cause. She denied the
report.
Carrie Swain took to the lively
music hall life as a solace, and her j
career ought to have roused In Gard- |
ncr the fires of jealoupy. However, he '
married Mile. Brouillet, and then
came the suit of the former actress.

and the object of their expedition is to
investigate the oft-heard report that
there is a large drove of wild horses of
most peculiar appearance in that part
of Mexico. These animals are said to
be striped and bear a close resemblance
to the zebra. They are said to
make their home in a rich valley
which Is almost completely shut in by
the towering cliffs of the mountains.
It Is t he theory of Professor Ewart
that all horses were one time striped
and that their present colorings and
absence of stripes are due to intermix
ing the breed. He has been studying
the question for several years and re
cently finished an exhaustive research
into the prehistoric remains of horses
on the islands of Porto Rico and Ja
maica.
The account of the existence of a
large drive of striped horses In the
Sierra Madres seems to be authentic.
Long before white men had penetrated
the almost inaccessible region Indians
who lived in the mountains told of
having seen this drove of horses. About
fifteen years ago an American mining
prospector named Hampton Bradley,
who formerly lived at Parral, where
he owned and operated the Marco
mine, made a trip Into the mountains.
He was gone for about three months
and upon -his return he told of having
visited the valley where he aaw thlÃ
drove of horses. He said that there
were several thousand of the animals
and that their feeding ground em
braced many thousand acres of rich,
level land, with a small stream of
water running through It.

WILD POSIES ON EXHIBITION
Nature's Springtime Manifestations Much Admired
OAKLAND, March 25. â Every nook
and cornÂ«r of thÂ« children's room In
the Carnegie library was filled with
wild flowers to-day at the second an
nual wild flower exhibit of the Oak
land public school children.
Durmg the hours of the display,
from 9 a, m. to 8 p. m., more than
1000 people visited the library to in
spect ajid admire the exhibit of spring
blossom*, gathered by the little folk.
Dr. Edward F. Bipelow, editor of
the nature department of St. Nicho
las' Magazine, who has come to this
city to attend the teachers' institute.
was the guest of the children at 10
Â«- m. and gave an interesting address
to The little ones. In his talk Dr.
Bigelow compared the conditions in
Oakland, where the children may pick
wild flowers on the roadside on their
way to and from school, to those in
New York, where many of the chil
dren have never seen a wild flower
growing.
The annual exhibit, which was in
stituted last year at the suggestion of
Miss Bertha Chapman, instructor of
nature study in the public schools,
vaÂ« held under the direction of a
committee of thirty teachers, of which
Mies Elizabeth Arlett was the chair
man. The city was divided into seven
districts, and the work of collecting
the flower* for the exhibit was done
by the children. The teachers sorted
and arranged the flowers this morn
ing and they were classified and ;
named by Miss Wyth<\ teacher of bot
any at the Oakland High School.
Great surprise was expressed by
many of the visitor? at the extent of
the display. More than 100 varieties
of native wild flowers are on exhibi
tion. The little folks, who had
worked hard to make the exhibit a
success, were keenly alive to the in
terest shown by those who attended
the festival and took great delight in j
displaying their collections to the best
advantage. The entire exhibit was- in
charge of Miss Chapman, who was as
sisted in arranging the flowers by Li
brarian Greene. At the close of the
exhibit every -one who had attended
pronounced the second annual wild
Cower festival a grand success.

death of A. J. McLeod, who passed
away yesterday at his home in Liver

development of the Livermore Valley.

first general merchandise store ever
opened in Livermore, and while con
ducting thsft business received the ap
pointment as the first postmaster of
Livermore.

the active life of the farm to open t-tee-
American Exchange Hotel at Center
ville, and one year later he removed
to. Irvington, at that time known as
Washington Corners, where he built j
the Union Hotel.
Early in 1869 McLeod removed to
Livermore, becoming the owner of Mc-
Leod's Addition, which is now a part
of the town. In the same year, with
Henry Meyers as a partner, he opened
the first general store In the town,
this store being the beginning of the
well-known firm of Anspacher Bros.
Two years after opening the busi
ness Meyers sold out and his interest
was purchased by one of the AnSpach
ers. tile firm name being Anspacher &
McLeod.
McLeod was appointed postmaster of
Livermore in 1869. holding this office
till 1882. He was elected Township As
sessor in 1879, which office he also
held until 1882.

and Colin McLeod. Miss Annie Mc-
Leod, Mrs. D. J. Murphy and Mrs. L.

ENGAGES ATTORNEY
TO FIGHT THE CASE
Fair Student Traces Her
Family Connections and
Finds She Isl Descended
From House of Grawburghs
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center street, March 25.
Claiming to be the direct heir to a
great estate in Germany, now in the
hands of the Kaiser's Government,
Miss Mabel Hansen, a junior student
at the university In the college of me
chanics, has begun proceedings to have
restored to her what is declared to be
her rightful property. She resides with
her mother, Harriet Hansen, at 2932
Adeline street in South Berkeley.
The estate to which the young wo
man lays claim is said to have been
held by the Grawburghs, members of
the German nobility, from whom Miss
Hansen claims to be a direct descend
ant. She learned recently of this re
lationship and that it entails, accord
ing to her informants, a large interest
in an $11,000,000 estate. She placed the
matter in the hands of a San Francisco
attorney, who is soon to leave for New
York, where he will Institute a search
of records that is expected to estab
lish Miss Hansen's claim to the prop
erty.
If this claim is established action
w-ill be begun at once to compel the
German Government to restore to Miss
Hansen what may be adjudged as her
share of the estate now held by the
empire.
Miss Hansen has always believed
that she is a descendant of the Graw
burghs, but has lacked dooumentary
evidence to prove the interesting fact.
She has made a study of the genealogy
of noble houses of Germany, and
though unable to cite proofs in support
of her claim, declares that she will
eventually prove her assertions and se
cure a share of the vast wealth of the
Grawburghs.

ROBBERS STILL

in Keeping Under Cover
MAY BE IN THE EAST
Sheriff Frank Barnett Be

Left Vicinity of Crime
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, March 25.
Search for the masked robbers who,
at the points of a rifle and a revolver,
held up John E. Daly and Frank K.
Roche and relieved them of $10,000 be
longing to the Central Bank, still goes
on, but so far with little apparent re
sults. Sheriff Frank Barnett spent
several hours to-day at the Oakland
racetrack Investigating a report that
a man answering the description of
one of the robbers was located in one
of the stables there, but he was unable
to discover anything that would lead
to the belief that this report was true.
W. S. Rheem, superintendent of the
Pacific Coast Oil Refinery, said to
night that, as far as he had been able
to learn, no trace of the robbers had
been found among the former em
ployes of the refinery; but he said also
that It would have been easy for any
one connected with the works to learn
when the money was expected and to
lay plans for the robbery.
Sheriff Veale of Contra Costa County
was in Oakland this morning in con
ference with Sheriff Barnett, but he
says that there are no new develop
ments in the case. A report was cir
culated this morning to the effect that
the rifle and mask used by one of the
robbers had been found, but this Is de
nied by the officers who are conduct
ing the investigation. No further clew
has been discovered to the man who
rented the buggy used by the robbers
from Abernethy's stable on San Pablo
avenue.
Sheriff Frank Barnett. in speaking
of the robbery to-night, paid:
"So much time has elapsed now since
the robbery that the men have had
ample time to get away, and I consider
it very doubtful that they will be cap
tured in this part oT the country.
Naturally the first thing that men
who had made a successful haul of so
large an amount of money would do
would be to get as far away from the
scene of the crime as possible, and I
am satisfied that this is what the men
who robbed Daly have done. There are
many new rumors every day, but at
present we have little that is of any
real value to work on. Still we have
not abandoned the search and hope to
discover the men who committed the
crime."

Longest Lasting Woods.
Some Interesting experiments have
been made to ascertain which wood
lasts the longest. It was found ac
cording to the Indianapolis News, that
birch and aspen decayed in three
years, willow and chestnut in four
years, maple and red beech in five
years and elm and ash In seven years
Oak. Scottish fir and Weymouth pine
decayed to the depth of half an inch
In seven years; larch and juniper
were uninjured at the end of seven
years. In situations so free from
moisture that they may be practically
called dry the durability of timber is
unlimited. The roof of Westminster
Hall, London, is more than 450 years

Effect of Colors.
Red will annoy a turkey cock as
much as a bull, but a sparrow will not
let it disturb its mind. But If one
flirts a blue rag in front of a caged
sparrow's eyes he will go frantic with
disgust. Sparrows and linnets, too,
will refuse food offered them on a
piece of blue paper and dislike the
appearance of any one wearing a blue
dress. Medium light blue affects
them most, and blue serge they
scarcely mind at all. Thrushes and
blackbirds object to yellow, but will
use red or blue dried grasses left
about their haunts to build the outer
layers of their nests. Yellow grasses
they will not use. â Chicago Journal.
Parisian Prejudices.
In nothing is Paris more artistic
than in the designs of the metropolitan
railway stations. But there are mal
contents. The new station in the Place
de l'Opera is denounced because It is
rot what the French journals call
"modern style." It Is eighteenth cen
tury and looks like the Trianon at
Versailles on a small acale. "What
have we to do with the eighteenth cen
tury?" cry the conscientious objectors.
"No true republican can take his ticket
at such a station without violating; his
imrijuiiples." â New York Tribune.

Vice President Bryan of th* TntÂ«.
The transit lines of New York wera
put to the most severe test of the win!
ter during the recent storm. On the

elevated lines of the Interborough sis!

subway lines 411,000. making in all 1

twenty-four hours, with little or no
interruption of traffic.
"The popularity of the subway was
clearly demonstrated, and the ease with
which the 411.0)0 passengers were car
ried shows that the system with tfia
present incomplete terminals and fa.
cilnies is amply able to handle 150 000 "

could be easily Increased by putting
into effect on the local tracks of the

Hepburn's Grudge Against Barber*.
Colonel "Pete" Hapburn. Repre
sentative from lowa and ehairma-n of
the Interstate and Foreign Commerce
Committee, has a grudge against bar
bers and he feeds It fat.
A year ago people not members of
the House could get shaved in the
House barber shop. Colonel "Pete"
went In one morning with a grouch
and two days' whiskers. The chairs
were filled, some of them with out
siders. Thereupon he jumped up
stairs and got an order from the
Speaker shutting all persons not
members out of the shop and thus de
priving the barbers of some extra
money.
A little room near the doorkeeper's
office was set aside for a public bar
ber shop. Colonel Hepburn de
cided he wanted that room for
private conferences in connection with
his committee work and the barbers
were driven to the sub-basement.
"I suppose," said one of the barbers,
'that Hepburn will soon introduce a
resolution in the House requiring all
people to cut their own hair." â New

"Yes," said the officer politely.
"Have you read the Bible?"
"Yes."

ADVISES NEW
NAVY DOCTORS
President Roosevelt Delivers
Address at Graduating
Exercises in Washington
WARNS THE PHYSICIANS ;
,
Tells > Medicos That They
Must Prepare Themselves â¢
r to Sustain High Standard
WASHINGTON, March 25.-Presi
dent Roosevelt presented diplomas to
day to the class graduated from the
United States Medical School at exer
cises hell in the hall of the National
Museum. He addressed a large audi
ence and delivered a message to the
twenty -three newly made doctors on
the responsibilities of the service they
have entered. The President said:
"You represent two professions, for
you are members of the great medical
body and you are also officers of the
navy of the United States and there
fore you have a double standard to
perform. 1 think that all of us lay
men, men and women, have a peculiar
appreciation of what a doctor means,
for I do not suppose there is one of us
who does not teel the family doctor
stands in a position of close intimacy,
in a position of obligation under wnich
one is happy to rest to an extent that
hardly any one else can stand; and
those of us who, I think most of us, are
fortunate enough to have a family doc
tor who is an intimate friend, realize
that tnere can be few closer ties of in
timacy and affection in the world.
â Just as the great doctor, the man
who stands high in his profession, in
any city, counts as one of the most
valuable assets in that city's civic
work, so in the navy or the army the
effect of having thoroughly well
trained men with a high and sensitive
standard of professional honor and
professional duty Is well nigh incalcu
lable upon the service itself.
"I am not competent to speak save in
the most general terms of your profes
sional duties. I do want, however, to
call your attention to one or two fea
tures connected with them. In the first
place, in connection with the work you
do for the service you have peculiar
advantages in doing the work that will
be felt by the whole profession. For
instance, it will come to your lot to deal
peculiarly with certain types of trop
ical diseases. You will have to deal
with them as no ordinary American
doctor, no matter how great his expe
rience, will have to deal with them,
and you should fit yourselves by more
careful study and preparation so that
you shall not only be able to grapple
with cases as they come up, but in
grappling with them to make and re
cord observations upon them that will
be of permanent value to your fellows
in civil life.
"There probably is not a branch of
the profession Into which during your
career you will not have to go, no type
of disease that you will not have to
treat, and it is of consequence to the
entire medical profession that you
should bo fit yourselves by study and
preparation that you shall not only be
able to deal with those cases, but to
deal with them In a way that will be of
advantage to your stay-at-home breth
ren.
"There is one other point: Every ef
fort should be made to provide you
with ample means to do your work.
Every effort ought to be made to per
suade the national legislature to take
that view of the situation and to re
member that in case of war it is neces
sary to provide a gTeat medical service
for the army and navy. The needed in
crease is more keenly felt in the army
than in the navy, because it is always
the army that undergoes the greatest
expansion. But it is felt in both ser
vices. If there is trouble among the
volunteer forces it is feverish to the
greatest degree for the public men,
and especially for the public press, to
complain and shriek over the people
who happen to be in power at that
time. Let them shriek, or rather do
not let them shriek at all, for shriek
ing ie a sign of hysteria; but let them
solemnly think over and repent of the
fact that they have not made their
representatives provide adequately in
advance for the medical system in its
personnel and its material and its or
ganization and medical instruments
necessary to make that organization
effective, which, if prepared in ad
vance, will obviate the trouble which
is certain to come if we have war. Let
them remember not to blame the peo
ple in power wn en the big breakdown
come?, but blame themselves â the peo
ple of the United States â because they
have not had the forethought to take
the steps in advance which will pre
vent that breakdown occurring. Means
ought to be provided. That is part of
our duty. If we fail in it then it is
our responsibility, not yours."

TREPHINING MAY
END MENINGITIS
Apparently Successful Ex
periment Tried on 9- Year-
Old Patient in New York
OPEBATION RELIEVING
Number of Deaths Caused
by the Mysterious Disease
Arouses Health Officers
NEW YORK. March 25. â Cases
of cerebro spinal meningitis continue
to be reported in this city, three deaths
having occurred in the last twenty
four hours. All the victims were
adults. In two of the cases there were
no symptoms of the malady until
within a few hours before death.
An experiment of trephining the skull
has beeYi tried on a boy 9 years old at
Flower b Hospital and has apparently
been successful. The operation took
place nearly a week ago, and since then
leading specialists have watched
the patlont anxiously in the hope that
a method of treatment of the mysteri
ous disease might be found. It is said
he hss shown signs of relief and hopes
are entertained for his complete re
covery.
The disease is the most baffling with
which the Health Department has evev
b*en confronted in the matter of lack
Of knowledge of its symptoms, cure and
prevention of general Bpread.
A medical journal issued to-day says
there is a singular resemblance be
tween the symptoms of cerebro spinal
meningitis and typhus fever, which
frequently leads to confusion before an
exact clinical diagnosis can be had,
and it in<ficates the points of similarity.
It also calls attention to the efficacy
of the simple measures as preventives
and refers to the neglect of the mouth
aDd nose, which permits many patho
genic micro-organisms to reach more
vital parts.
DUEL TO THE DEATH
IX COLORADO SALOON
Mining Men Renew Old Quarrel and
One Becomes Candidate for
tfie Morgue.
SILVERTON, Colo.. March 25.â At j
Eureka, ten miles north of here, Mar- '
shal Mackenzie, a well-known mine
promoter of this county, was fatally
shot late this afternoon by Arthur
Rice, a mining man of Eureka and
candidate for Alderman on the Citi
zens' ticket in that town.
Early this year the men had trouble
over the possession of some mining
claims, and since then they have been
sworn enemies. To-day they met in a â¢
saloon, where the quarrel was renewed,
and Mackenzie fired five times at his
enemy. Rice rushed behind the bar
and, securing a revolver, shot Macken
zie through the left breast. Mackenzie
died shortly afterward. He was 40
years old and came to Colorado several
years ago from the East.
WRITER'S SON MAY DIE
AS RESULT OF A FALL
Spine Is Fractured by Tumble From
the Veranda of His
Home.
NEW YORK, March 26. â Sterling
Stuart, the 2 3 -year-old son of Ruth
McEnery Stuart, the writer, is re
ported as showing a slight improve
ment at the Flushing Hospital, where
he was taken yesterday after having
fallen from the roof of a veranda to
which he had climbed In an effort to
enter his home without his latchkey.
His spine is fractured and dislocated
at the lower dorsal vertebrae.
Stuart's condition is critical and the
surgeons express little hope of his re
covery. If he is found to be strong
enough an operation may be at
tempted to-day.

AVEBURY'S PRESUMPTION
DISPLEASES WASHINGTON
Titled Briton Ignores Official Etiquette
in Writing to State De.
imrtment.
WASHINGTON, March 25. â Some
surprise has been caused here at the
receipt by the State Department of a
communication from Lord Avebury,
chairman of the foreign bondholders,
soliciting the intervention of the
American Government between Pana
ma and Colombia to secure the as
sumption by the former of a share of
the Colombian foreign debt, which is
in a large part held by this organiza
tion. Without regard to the equity of
the proposal, the official mind here is
disturbed at the infraction of diplo
matic custom Involved in the dispatch
of this communication and the atten
tion of the senders has been called to
the fact that the only channel by
which the State Department can prop
erly receive communications from cit
izens of foreign countries is through
their own Embassadors or Ministers.

"Words cannot express the gratitude I feel toward you for
what Cuticura Soap, Ointment and Resolvent: have done for me.
My son had Eczema as bad as any child could have it. I had sev-
eral doctors treat him. but they helped him only for the time being,
-y, and after they discontinued treat-
ffili^lSi ing him his head would begin to
wS^lp get sore again, almost the next
CggSc* "silL day. It got so bad I really didn't
&?r^-^i_^\ know what to do. At last we took

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 26, 1905.
PIQUE CAUSE
OF REAGAN'S
OPPOSITION
Commissioner's Vote Against
Wittman Declared by Ex-
Cliief to Have Been Due
to Son's Disappointment
HAS AMBITION TO
BE A DETECTIVE
Parent Tries to Have Boy
Promoted From the Ranks,
but Fails to Convince
Late Head of Department
Police Commissioner Thomas Reagan
feels great pride in the young son he
had aopolnted to the department as a
patrolman, and it was because former
Chief of Police Wittman refused to
promote the youth to the rank of de
tective sergeant that the bitter per
sonal enmity was aroused that led to
the ousting of the head of the depart
ment so far as the insurance man's
vote was concerned at the meeting of
the board night before last.
Wittman yesterday felt free to dis
cuss the matter, and he confirmed
the report that has been published pre
viously in The Call.
"Young Reagan was appointed to the
force last May," said the deposed
Chief, "and in October his father came
to me with a request that the son be
made a detective. I explained that I
could not run the department on such
principles and that the detective force
must be made up of men who had
had wide experience and had demon
strated their fitness. Commissioner
Reagan from that time on was a bitter
enemy of mine."
WHY MARTIN WAS SCALPED.
Another interesting phase of the ad
ministration's policy in regard to the
Police Department has come out sincu
Wittman's dismissal. Captain John
Martin was not removed from the sta
tion of captain of detectives and dis
rated to the command of the Harbor
station on Wittman's own volition, but
as a result of the persistent demands
of Mayor Schmitz.
Captain Martin, it appears, could not
refrain from participating in politics
and his quiet activities were found out
to be directed against the administra
tion. For over a year Mayor Schmitz
had insisted that the captain should be
punished and Wittman felt himself
driven to comply.
Martin and the former Chief have
been close friends for many years and
Wittman signified his confidence in the
captain by appointing him head of the
detective force as soon as command of
the department was given him. There
was much mystery therefore when
Captain Martin was put out of his
higher post some months ago.
The revelations that are now made
are that the demoralizing whip la be
ing wielded over the department, the
lash of which Wittman has been made
to feel more keenly than did Martin,
to whom he had himself been a party
in applying it.
Mayor Schmitz, it is understood, did
not undertake to name Martin's suc
cessor as captain of detectives, prob
ably because he realized that the bluff
Chief of Police would not submit to
such interference. In any event the
appointment of Captain Burnett was
Wittman's own selection.
JERRY DIXAN TO BE CHIEF.
It eeems certain that Jerry Dinan,
now a detective sergeant, will be the
new Chief of Police. His close personal
relations with Mayor Schmitz will lift
him into the high station. When ad
dressed banteringly as "Chief" Dinan
becomes indignant and declares "it's
all hop smoke," but it is believed on
every hand that he is the man in view
to ride the horse and wear the epaulet
with the single star.
It is not expected that Dinan will dis
turb Captain Burnett. They have been
good friends for many years, and the
captain appears to be a satisfactory
man all around. It is likely, however,
that Dinan would make some changes
in the 'detective force, of which he is
now a member. It would appear that
he would at least have to make pro
vision for young Reagan.
The Commissioner's eon is not far out
of his teens and has already been be
fore the board on a charge of unofflcer
like conduct. He was found not guilty,
however. His fellow-patrolmen curry
his favor. Of course, the authority in
vested in him has turned his head, it is
said, and there has been complaint
against him because of his overbearing
manner.
But Chief Wittman's refusal to ele
vate him to the post of detective ser
geant was based on a rule that is law
in the department from immemorial
custom. The promotions to the "upper
office" have been made for meritorious
work and an exhibition of ability to
run criminals to earth.
Wittman haa not decided whether he
will contest the action of he Commis
sioners In the courts. "The matter is
In the hands of Julius Kahn, my at
torney," explained the former Chief.
The Congressman said he would come
to a conclusion on Monday. It is the
impression f hat the former Chief will
institute no 'suit, because such a step
would probably not be advisable from
a practical standpoint.
WITTMAX IS NOT WEALTHY.
"It is not true that I leave the de
partment a wealthy man," said Witt
man yesterday. "On the contrary I
must find something to do at once. I
have many friends and I hope to get a
position within a short time. At the
present time, however, I have abso
lutely nothing in view. Many messages
have come to me offering sympathy be
cause of the outrage to which I was
subjected by the Police Commissioners
after twenty-two years of faithful serv
ice in the department.
"But there's no ill wind that does
not blow some good. My wife is might
ily pleased. She hopes that my career
as a Dolice official is over. Not for
twenty-two years have I been able to
spend my evenings at home, and the
prospect now assures the gratification
of her wishes that I might have my
evenings to myself."
Congressman Kahn also voices a de
nial of the reports that Wittman owns
property worth $100,000 or more, as has
been reported. "I know whereof I
speak," asserted the attorney, "and I
will say authoritatively that the only
property Wittman has is a small piece
located on Devisadero street, and alto
gether he is not worth more than $6000
in worldly goods."

SMALL CROWDS
GREET MASTER
OF THE VIOLIN
San Francisco has by no means done
itself proud in the welcome accorded
to Fritz Kreisler, but yesterday after
noon's audience made the Alhambra
look a good deal more as it should
have looked throughout the season.
It is not possible for audiences to be
more enthusiastic than Kreisler's have
been, but the attendance has been
ridiculously small when one considers
that quite the greatest violinist ever
heard here, and perhaps the greatest
of living violinists, was the attraction.
So much larger was the house yester
day, however, that Mr. Greenbaum
has wisely decided upon an extra con
cert for next Sunday. By that time
word of what Kreisler is will have fil
tered into the community, every audi
tor being a devoted advertiser.
The Bruch concerto in G minor was
the piece de resistance of yesterday
afternoon's programme and was given
in magnificent fashion. Paganini, for
the playing of whom Kreisler first
came into prominence six years ago
in Berlin, was represented by the "Non
Piu Mesta" variations. The astound
ing technical difficulties were sur
mounted with utmost ease and an ova
tion greeted the player after its ren
dering.
The lovely Tartini "Variations" on
a theme of Corelli's were substituted
for the Chaminade 'Spanish Seren
ade" in response to innumerable re
quests and aroused stubborn demands
for a repeat that Mr. Kreisler hard
heartedly refused. He had, however,
been compelled to play aga'n the
Rameau "Tambourin" and the Dvorak
"Humoresque" and also gave gener
ously an encore to his concluding num
ber, two of Brahms "Hungarian
Dances."
The programme of the last recital
will include the Beethoven Concerto,
and it should not be missed by any
one Interested in music of any kind,
from the barrel organ down.

MAJOR GENERAL
SAYS GOOD BYE
Division Commander John H.
Dickinson Addresses the
Members of National Guard
REORGANIZING FORCE
Lieutenant Colonel Edward
Forbes Resigns From the
Second Regiment Infantry
In retiring from the office of division
commander of the National Guard of
California, Major General John H.
Dickinson, in an address to the vari
ous organizations says:
"Having been identified with the
Guard in active service since the Ist
day of April, 1877, except when on the
retired list as brigadier general I deem
It fit that I should say a parting word
to those particularly who were in the
service when I became identified with
it, and also to those who have since
become and now are active members
of the command. Twenty-eight years
is a good part of a lifetime to be de
voted even partially to any service,
and necessarily have seen many
changes in the personnel of the Guard
as well as in the laws and regulations
which have governed it. Many old
comrades have passed away, and many
remain, but the lives of all give the
best evidence of their love of country
and State and that feeling which made
us members of the National Guard
and has kept us in the service is the
basic feeling upon which the founda
tions of our common country rest.
"In taking this formal parting from
the officers and men of the National
Guard, I can but ask that yoft will per
form your duties in the future as faith
fully and as efficiently as you have in
the past, with the same intelligence
and alacrity, and above all with the
same love and pride for the flag of our
country."
The superior office in Sacramento Is
at work rearranging matters so as to
meet the conditions of the National
Guard under the recently signed re
organization bill. As yet no announce
ments have been made as to who will
be placed in command of the two bri
gades into which the guard will be
divided. It was confidentially asserted
a short time since that Colonel Kos
ter would be one of the new briga
diers, but during the past week it was
given out that It looked as if W. Frank
Pierce of Oakland was the coming man.
Colonel J. F. Burgin, who for twen
ty-one years was an active member
of the Guard and at the time he asked
to be placed on the retired list was
adjutant of the Second Brigade, has
been placed there, in a five-line type
written order, which merely declared
the fact, but makes no mention of his
long service.

PLACE A QUARANTINE
UPON FOVR DAIRIES
Health Officials Swoop Down on
Ranches Condemned as Unsan
itary and Destroy Milk.
Chief Inspecting Physician Hassler
of the Board of Health, in company
with Milk Inspectors O'Connor, Len
drum and Brady and four police of
ficers, swooped down yesterday morn
ing on the dairies of L. de Santl, L.
Reichmuth, Lauberge Bros, and Nicoli
& Sbragia, located on Berlin street
and Seventeenth avenue and S street
south, and quarantined them.
Some months ago the Board of
Health, acting on the recommendation
of Health Officer Ragan, condemned
these dairies because they were in a
filthy condition and the milk from
them was full of bacteria and unfit
for human consumption. The dairy
men frustrated the efforts of the
Health Department by securing in
junctions and continuing their busi
ness. Lauberge Bros, and Nicoli &
Sbragia decided to move to cleaner
premises and the legal proceedings
having been brought in the name of
Lauberge, there was no action pend
ing. Before another injunction could
be secured the health officials called
upon Acting Chief of Police Spillane
and secured the services of policemen
to guard the milk supply and prevent
it being taken from the dairies. These
officers were on the scene yesterday
morning and the dairymen were re
strained from dispensing their milk
to their customers. As soon as the
cows were milked yesterday the milk
was thrown away and this will be
done until the premises are vacated.

SUCCESSFUL TEST OF NEW AEROPLANE
Vofessor Montgomery of Santa Clara College, assisted by Father Bell, has invented an aero
plane which proved a success at the tests recently held in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The
machine was at aii times under control of the aeronaut and worked in a marvelous manner.
'rofessor Montgomery's invention promises to solve the problem of aerial navigation.
Inventor is Confident That He Has Solved
the Problem of Aerial Navigation.

riments have been conducted for
time nest at Leonard's ranch in
anta Cruz Mountains, fifteen miies
Santa Cruz. The three final tests
held this month. These were on
6th and 18th of March, and the
third on last Monday. Professor Mont
gomery has been assisted by Father
Bell lr. his invention.
On Monday John Maloney, an aero
naut and parachute-jumper, covered
more than two miles in experimenting
v Ith the aeroplane. The aeroplane.
w ith Maloney, was taken up to a
height of 3000 feet by a hot air balloon
and then the aeroplane was cut loose.
M&loney circled about at a rapid and
hen a slow rate, and then horizontal
ly. He next brought the aeroplane to
a standstill and finally alighted at a
particular spot he was directed to in a
two-acre field. He had absolute con
trol of the machine. The test was a
success and Professor Montgomery and
his friends are delighted.
The aeroplane is a sort of double
winged arrangement with a divided
surface, and to the casual observer ap
pears as a two- winged machine, but in
reality it has but a single wing, di
vided into two parts. It weighs forty
two pounds. Its frame is constructed
of light spruce wood, covered with cot
ton cloth and braced with .steel wire.
The machine can be manufactured at a
slipht cost.
The invention is not yet perfected,
but Professor Montgomery has no
d.Â«iubt but that his, idea is ; the ' right
one. He is now constructing two ma
chines, which he will use in an exhi
bition to :. be given before representa
tives of the press. These exhibitions
'will take place at Santa Clara College
some time next month. All of the testa
made by Professor . Montgomery, who
has been aided by Father Bell, have
been a success. No long attempts at
flight have been* undertaken and the
aeronaut operating the', machine has
been working under directions of the
Inventor. Now that the i principle of
flight ha* been proven. Professor
Montgomery- will perfect' his: Idea.'
While the success " of the ' individual
machine is assured, he is confident that
the principle can be applied to airships
â¢o that they can carry - â¢ passengers.

MANY VISITORS
ARE ARRIVING
AT CORONADO
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HOTEL DEL COROXADO. March
26. â Judging from the number of ar
rivals at the hotel each day and the
long list of reserved apartments, the
season for winter visitors to Coronado
is far from being over. Late last week
an excursion party of more than one
hundred persons, mostly from New
England, arrived, and each day since
has brought its quota.
Later came a party composed of the
following distinguished gentlemen:
Nicholas Murray Butler of New York
City, president of Columbia College;
Newton C. Dougherty, Superintendent
of Public Instruction at Peorla, 111.,
and Edwin Hewitt, son of Abram
Stevens Hewitt, ex-Mayor of New
York.
Mr. and Mrs. Paul Schmidt and
their guest. Mrs. Elder of Peoria, 111.,
are among the visitors to Coronado.
Herbert Hammond has arrived from
the East to remain indefinitely, Mrs.
Hammond and their sen having been
members of the cottage community
for several months past.
Mr. and Mrs. Charles Hanford came
in on the 21st and were welcomed by
a number of friends and admirers.
Colonel J. Murray Hoag U. S. A.,
retired, and Mrs. Hoag have taken
apartments at the hotel for a stay of
indefinite length.
applied for upon the invention and it
is expected this will shoVtly be granted.
In regard to the principle of flight as
applied to the aeroplane, Professor
Montgomery said:
"My idea is that the sustaining sur
face is not alone ta be considered, but
there are important movements set up
in the surrounding air which necessi
tate a peculiar form of surface and
adjustment. The central difference be
tween that idea of mine and others is
this: Others have considered only the
surface, while I have considered the
surface, the movements set up in the
surrounding air and the form and po
sition of the surface consequent upon
these movements."

ACCUSED TELL
THEIR STORIES
XAPA, March 25. â The trial of At
tendants T. D. Shanahan and Oscar
Retzman of the Napa State Hospital
on a charge of killing Patient Joseph
R. Louis at the institution on Decem
ber 25 last was resumed this morning
before Judge Gesford and a jury.
Oscar Retzman,- one of the defandants]
was recalled to the stand.
He testified that after Louis had at
tacked him in room 4 of ward B and
had kicked him severely in the groin
Shanahan went to his assistance and
had a fierce struggle with Louis. Retz
man went up to Louis as Shanahan
had him against the wall and pulled
Louis' legs out from under him. This
was the treatment for dangrerous pa
tients advised by Superintendent F. K.
Stone of the asylum several months
before in a lecture given to the at
tendants. After Louis fell, with
Shanahan on top, Shanahan asked
Retzman to help put Louis on a mat
tresp. Retzman was still in great pain
and unable to assist, so a patient
named Belgrade was called by Shana
han and assisted Shanahan. Louis
hrid foam and blood on his mouth and
Shanahan wiped this off on a sheet.
O n cross-examination Retzman admit
ted to District Attorney Benjamin
that ho concealed the manner of
Louis' death from Assistant Superin
tendent Raney and the physicians
when questioned just after the death
of Louis.
The defendant, T. S. Shanahan, was
then called to the stand and gave a
detailed account of the events con
nected with the death of Louis. His
story of the events tallied with that
given by Retzman.

WILL TRY
TO PURIFY
POLITICS
Patriotic Republicans Want
to Divorce Euef and Herrin
From the Party and Do
All Possible for New Deal
TIME IS RIPE FOE
DRIVING OUT EVIL
Belief Is General That In
dependents - Would Rally
'Support v of Party if
Grafters Are Fought Eight
Leading Republicans of the city are
firmly convinced that the party,
through the agency of the primary
election law. can elect a sufficient
number of delegates to the next
municipal nominating convention to
nominate a ticket that will command
the unqaulified indorsement of the
great mass of independent voters.
It is quite well understood that the
Republicans in the several Assembly
districts of San Francisco must, in or
der to achieve success, smash the po
litical machine, which \v;is established
by Herrin, Ruef and Lynch to defeat
Henry J. Crocker for Mayor at the last
municipal election. In the Thirty
fifth, Thirty-Sixth, Thirty-ninth and
Forty-first Assembly districts the de
termination to smash the machine is
openjy fexi.ressed by many active citi
zens. Other districts will join in the
work of machine-wrecking:
Former United States Senator A. P.
Williams, who has always stood for
good government and clean politics, is
of the opinion that the independent
Republican citizen:", who have no
sympathy for grafters, can easily win,
but he asserts that organized effort
under practical leadership is essential.
It has been suggested that the Mer
chants' Association shoald designate
a time for a mass-meeting in each As
sembly district, so that citizens may
come together and devise proper
means for getting control of the Re
publican and Democratic nominating
conventions. It is a sure thing that
Republicans will not wait for Herrin,
Ruef and Lynch to pass out a list of
delegates to be voted for. The initia
tive will be taken by the people. Con
ferences have already taken place in
the Thirty-fifth and Forty-first and
anti-Ruef delegations will represent
these districts.
ALL WANT HONESTY.
Citizens, irrespective of party, have
resolutely determined to bring about
an honest and capable administration
of local affairs. Republican leaders
who are reading the signals compre
hend that a ticket put forward under
the auspices of the Herrin, Ruef and
Lynch machine will not receive the
support of citizens who have resolved
for a betterment of conditions. They
are also convinced that a Republican
ticket headed by a fearless, capable,
and an honest man for Mayor will
command the support of active non
partisan bodies. All along the Repub
lican line one hears this talk:
"In order to win the Republicans
must exclude Herrin, Huef, Lynch and
their followers from the councils of
the party and go before the people
with cledi 'hands."
In political camps this question la
asked: "Will the high officers of the
Southern Pacific approve of an exten
sion of the Herrin-Ruef compact
through which Henry Crocker was de
feated and Eugene Schmitz elected in
the contest*Â«or Mayor two years ago?"
One of Herrin's lieutenants is quoted
as saying that the compact terminated
when Ruef made good to Herrin by
going to Sacramento and casting the
Ruef vote of the Legislature In favor
oi' the Los Angeles candidate for Unit
ed States Senator. It transpires that
the original compact was finally ad
justed on the day preceding the nom
ination of Henry Crocker for Mayor
by the Republican local convention.
Prior to that time many conferences
between Ruef and Herrin took place,
but the latter did not agree to give the
order to down Crocker until a few
hours before the nomination was made.
The Call obtains from an authentic
source the statement that Herrin paid
the expenses of the United Republican
League up to the time of Crocker's
nomination by the Republican conven
tion.
RUEF- HERRIN SCHEMES.
It is the judgment of well-informed
Republicans and Democrats that the
political partnership of Herrin and
Ruef exists and will continue in full
force throughout the coming munici
pal campaign. The present pro
gramme is to re-elect Schmitz, al
though Ruef, who is handy and re
sourceful, may take up some other
aspirant."
It is not likely that Ruef in any
event would attempt to force the
nomination of Schmitz in the Republi-'
can convention even if he should be
able to swing a majority of the dele
gates, but on the contrary would fol
low his old scheme of having Schmita
nominated by the labor unions and
encouraging desertions from the Re
publican party. Two years ago the
misguided followers of the Democratic
nominee did the very work that Ruef
secretly assigned to them. They shout
ed for Lane, when it was obvious to
the well-posted observers that he
could not carry any one of the As
sembly districts of the city, but the
HIGH SCHOOL BOYS
PERFORM CLEVERLY
Lick Colors Wave In Triumph Over Berkeley Oval
The stout-hearted athletes who sport
the black and gold of the California
School of Mechanical Arts (Lick
School) scored a decisive victory at
Berkeley oval yesterday in the twelfth
semi-annual field day of the Bay Coun
ties Athletic League. They won the
championship with a score of 48 points.
Oakland High School was second with
43 points. Berkeley High School scored
25%, Lowell 20 and Alameda 7%. Lick
and Oakland ran neck and neck
throughout the afternoon in the race
for points, first one and then the other
being in the lead.
The schools were strongly represent
ed by their pupils and each had
some well trained rooters. Oakland
carried off the palm in this respect.
During the entire time of the winning
of the exciting relay race the cheermg
pounded like the rattle of rapid-fire
guns.
Oakland led for the first half lap.
Berkeley then assumed the lead and !
held it until the finish, with the excep- j
tion of one instant in the last lap. when
Lick was in front. A claim of foul i
lodged against one of the Berkeley
men for cutting oft' another runner was
allowed and the team was disqualified.
This did not change the result of the
field day.
Although Trainer Christie pro
aounced the track fast, none of the
running records was broken. The only
new record established in actual com
petition was that for the hammer
throw. Moullen of Lick outclassed the
other competitors in this event and
hurled the big weight a distance of 157
feet 10 inches. The previous record of
151 feet was held by Blakemore.
Moullen also distinguished himself in ;
the pole vault. He finished second to
Vail, who won with a vault of 10 feet ;
H inch. Moullen, in a trial, covered 10 j
feet 8% inches, beating the former ret- j
ord of 10 feet 4 inches, held by Vail of
Oakland.
After winning the high jump, with a !
height of 5 feet 8% inches to his credit. I
Hall went on and cleared the bar at 5 ]
feet 10.68 inches. There is a question
as to whether the record will stand, i
owing to the number of trials he had.
E. Dozier of Oakland won both rhe
hurdle events. He is a big, rangy ath
lete and covers a lot of ground in a
long, swinging stride that promises
much when he is fully developed. In
the final of the 220-yard hurdles both
Doane and Peaseley. the other starters,
fell.
Gavin and Meyer of Lowell finished
first and second respectively in the
trying two-mile race. Thompson of
Lick came with a great rush at the
finish and took third place. All the
contestants had to #be assisted from
the track after the race.
Maundrell, the record holder, led
from start to finish in the mile event.
stalling 1 off a great rush of Mayer of
Lick at the end.
The quarter mile race and the 50
yard final each resulted in a dead heat,

to elect Schmitz.
In San Francisco it is calculated
there may be twelve thousand
straight-laced Republican who would
Bupport any ticket emanating from the
regular convention of the party. An
equal proportion of steadfast party
supporters may be found in the Demo
cratic camp. Doubtless Herrin and
Ruef are looking forward to the con
trol of both the regular party conven
tions, calculating that a purely non
partisan ticket could not muster, in
the face of two regular tickets, a suf
ficient number of voters to defeat the
nomineft of thr labor convention.
Here is where tht machine promoters
are making a false reckoning. The
people are now aroused as they never
were before. The awakening has not
taken the form of stormy public agi
tation. Mechanics, merchants, law
yers, bankers and the men belonging
to ihe great army of wage-earners
realize that San Francisco must be re
deemed from the rule of graft. Lead

voters will organize in every Assem

local convention who will respond to
the demands of the people.

KIND-HEARTED
TRIO ARRESTED
Three philanthropic saloon men who
assuaged the thirst and cured the in
ternal pains of two alleged painters out
near the Presidio Reservation were
arrested yesterday. It is agreed be
tween the Dost commander and the
Police Department that liquid joy shall
not be dispensed within a certain dis
tance of where the boys In blue abide,
and licenses are not granted within
this temperate zone. But it is well
known that there have been no deaths
from thirst out that way of late.
Yesterday Captain Mooney detailed
Policemen McDonald and McGee to
go out there in overalls and to paint
fences. They decorated the landscape
with alleged hair-oil "ads " and \
on the merits of certain liver pills.
By noon both developed a thirst and
severe cases of cramps. They entered
a benzine dispensary kept b\
Koeneke at I'slT Green street. Mc-
Donald rolled upon the floor and tied
himself into a double bow knot. M-. -
Gee followed suit with some twists that
would make a contortionist look sick.
"Whisky," they moaned m a mournful
duet.
Koeneke got a bottle and two
glasses. Four doses apiece and the
two alleged painters revived. You
have saved our liTes," they murmured,
with apparent gratitude.
"Tha,t is my business to save live*,"
said Koeneke. "Kick in with the
price, please."
The policemen went also to the sa
loons run by Aotone Meyers and James
Sheehan. At both these places they
were overcome with Sahara fever and
floored by oramps. The large-hearted
proprietors came to the rescue with th*
painkiller.
When the "painters" had secured
enough superficial and Internal evi
dence they swore out warrants for the
three philanthropists. The good sa
maritans were gathered fn at the North
End station. Now "The marble heart '

Much disappointment was expressed
the absence oâ¬ Sir Wilfred, Daru
ma, Roman Gold and Mary F, which
did not start, owing to various causes.
1 . W. BAKU IS I'IBLIC CHOICK.
F. W. Barr ruled an odds-oc favorite,
with Abe Meyer next in demand. The
price about Mooropus dropped from 15
to b, but the remaining starters cut lit
tie figure with bettors. Knapp, with
Mooropus, was first to show clear of the
field.
Tht favorite soon headed Ebel
Thatcher. Jones moving up on the in
side of the leader, which move cost
him the race. Mooropus outsprinted
Barr to the stretch and instead of com
ing out where the footing 'was good
Knapp picked the rail and kept the
favorite penned in on the inside of
his mount. Travers came out wide
with Ebel Thatcher and in a close fit
c wire was awarded a nose de
cision over the first choice. After be
ing cut off early in the game, Abe
Meyer only lost the show to Mooro
v a head. The value of the stake
t-"> the winner was $1325.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 2tt, 1905.
TENNIS TROPHY
FOR MISS HESS
Two tennis tournaments were played
on the park courts yesterday, one by
the young ladies and the other by the
boyts of the Junior Club. The former
event was a third-class handicap sin
gles tournament for the Miller cup.
Miss E. Hess, playing from the "3-6"
mark, proved the winner. In the finals
she beat Miss Bessie Cully in straight
sets. Miss Cully played from scratch
and, although defeated, made a good
showing.
In the previous round Mlbs Cully had
a hard match wllh Misa E. Noble. The
latter had the large handicap of 15 3-6
and came extremely close to beating
the scratch player. The score in Miss
Cully'g favor was 6-4, 3-6, 7-6.
The first match of the day was also
a close one. Miss E. Noble received
odds of "3-6" from Miss A. Greenberg.
They proved just large enough to en
able her to win. The score was 2-6,
8-6, 6-3. Miss Hess gave Miss G. Say
lor odds of "15" and defeated her after
two close sets had been played. The
score was 6-4. 7-5.
The Juveniles met in a handicap
doubles tournament. For the second
time Harold Getz and I* Levinson
carried off the honors. With their
names on the Manager's cups twice,
they have a big lead in the race for
the trophies. They played from "5-6"
back of scratch, receiving only "owe
2-6" from Mclaughlin and Martinez,
the most heavily handicapped team.
These two teams, which were undoubt
edly the best entered, met in the semi
finals and Getz and Levinson won eas
ily. They would probably have won
without the handicap, which was
small. The score was 6-4, 6-2. Oetz
and Levinson were underestimated by
the handicapper, as the scores show.
They went through the tournament
without losing a set and won their
matches as they pleased.
Lang and McLane also played good
tennis throughout the tourney. They
received liberal odds and made good
use of them. In the finals Getz and
Levinson proved much too steady for
them and the handicap team could
make little headway against the win
ners.
The result* follow:
H. Lang and H. McLane (4-7) beat
G. Sonntag and W. Marcus (1-6), 8-6,
6-4; R. Van Vliet and W. Patterson
(1-6) beat N. Abbott and Goldstein
(15 4-6), 6-1, 6-3; M. Morris and G. Mor
ris (J-6) beat R. Strachan and D. Stra
chan (owe 2-6) by default; R. Corbly
and V. Butler (scratch) beat H. Levin
son and R. Cutnmings (15 4-6), 6-3, 4-6,
6-4; M. McLoughlln and A- Martinez
(owe 16 1-6) beat H. Haven and W.
Mitchell (1-6), 6-4, 6-1.
First roundâ Lang and McLane beat
Bass and W. Ruggles (15), 6-3, 6-3; <
Morris and Morris beat Van Vliet and
Patterson, 6-4, 8-6; McLoughlin and
j. Martinez beat Corbly and Butler, 7-5,
I 3-6, 6-3; L. Levinson and H. Gets (Â©we
5-6) beat E. Garcia and H. Garcia
! (16 3-6), 6-2, 6-1.
Semi-finals â Lang and McLane beat
Morris and Morris, 7-5, 1-6, 6-2; Getz
and Levinson beat McLoughlin and
Martinez, 6-4. 6-2.
Finals â Getz and Levinson beat Lang
and McLane, 6-4, 6-2.

OPENING INNING BRINGS
JOY TO THE CHICAGO MEN
Miller Makes Unlucky Start
and Disaster Follows.
WHITEWASH FOR THE SEALS
The big leaguers enjoyed their first
chance to cheer yesterday at Recrea
tion Park. The shouting began in the
first inning and from that time only
one team was making noise and that
was Chicago. The Seals got theirs
after getting away like a bunch of
codflsh. It was Chicago for a fair-ye
well when the game was but a few
moments old, and the aspect never
changed till the finish came. Score â
Chicago 4, San Francisco 0.
The start was what beat the home
talent. It was as bad as any team
might wifeh to make. Roscoe Miller,
late of Pittsburg and other seaport
villages, waltzed over on the slab to
let the fans feast their peepers on him
for the iirst time. He did the best
he could, but he was in wrong, and
was beaten ere he could get a line on
the big leaguers.
Casey opened It up with a drive
over second and before Miller could
untangle himself Maloney had
dumped a bunt and beaten it out.
Along came Chance with a sacrifice,
putting both up a peg. Schulte waited
and was rewarded with a pass. A full
house and only one down was what
Mr. Miller had to go against.
Pennell lined a stiff wallop at Nealon.
He could not return the ball to the
pun in time, so he tossed it to first to
head off the runner. Miller dropped
the ball an<| Casey and Maloney
ambled home, while Schulte pulled
up at third. Tinker bit off a double
to right, letting Schulte arrive and
sending Pennell to third. Evers' out
put Pennell over the jump with the
last run of the game.
The Seals never could get over the
hypnotic atmosphere which surround
ed them while Wicker and Lundgren
wÂ«re serving up slants. Both had the
home tossers gasping, and with per
fect control and almost perfect field
ing the task of making it a clean
blank for nine rounds was not so
difficult.
"Flash" Nealon's work at the first
station was worth going out to the
park to see. He had nineteen chances
and most of them hard boys. The
busher ate every one up alive and
was cftlling for more. Incidentally he
swung through with a nice drive over
the third sack. He was robbed of
another hit by Evers in the last
period.
Uusher Henley pitched the last four
Johnson Is the Public Choice.
Jack Johnson and Marvin Hart will
finish their long seiges of training to
day. They are right on edge and no
two fighters have ever received a more
thorough preparation for a battle
than the colored Texan and the fight
ing Kentucklan. Johnson has been
in training for twenty-six days, and
the black boxer appears in better con
dition than he has been for the last
two years. His workouts with "Den
ver" Ed Martin have shown him shift
ier than ever before and he is thor
oughly satisfied with himself and con
fident of beating the Kentucky boy.
Both will box at their training quar
ters to-day.
In Marvin Hart Johnson will meet
the toughest proposition of his ca
reer. The Southern lad has been
working just as long and as hard as
the colored man and is trained to the
minute. When Hart starts fighting
he will remind the old fight fans of
Kid Carter when he was in his prime.
Like Carter, Hart is continually after
his man. willing to take any amount
of punishment if he can only land his
wallop once in a while.
The beting on the contest has
opened with Johnson a 1 to 2 favor
ite.
Scottish Bowlers Out in Force.
The Scottish bowlers crowded the
rinks at Golden Gate Park all yester
day afternoon and the green was taxed
to its utmost. Although the opening
round of the singles tournament was
scheduled for next Saturday, four of
the players disposed of their prelimi
nary round matches. In one James
Duncan beat A. R. Patterson, 21 to 15,
and James Black beat W. A. Cook,
21 to 18.
The following practice games were
played: R. Park and A. A. McVicar
beat James Black and T. McNaught,
21 to 19; Park and Dr. Gunn beat D.
O'Brien and McNaught, 21 to 15; Dr.
Hamilton and J. McLaren beat Judge
Shaw and J. M. Duncan, 21 to 10; J.

No other disease is so vile and destructive : as^Contagious Blood Poison. When the
.virus enters the blood the entire circulation becomes poisoned, and in a short time the symp-
toms begin to appear. The mouth and throat ulcerate, the hair and eyebrows fall . out, the

cases sores break out on the body, the finger nails drop off, and the sufferer finds himself
diseased from head to foot with the most hateful and humiliating of all poisons.

Accident Prevents "Babies"
From Beating Berkeley
Seniors in Close Finish
ROUT OF SOPHOMORES
University Crews Meet in
Regatta Practice Spurts
on Alameda Tidal Canal
ALAMEDA. March 25.-If H. K. Tul
lÂ«r, who rowed No. 3 in the freshmen
crew in the interclass regatta of the
University of California held this aft
ernoon on the tidal canal, had not
caught a "crab" 100 yards from the fin
ishing line he and his mates would
undoubtedly have won from the seniors
in the deciding and most exciting con
test of the day. Even after the fresh
men had sustained this setback they
pulled away and were only beaten a
scant length and a half. The distance
was over a course of about a mile
without a turn. No official time was
secured on this race.
There were three races and all were
over the same course. The starting line
was on the tidal canal near High
street bridge. The finishing line was
off the north end of Oak street. The
Fruitvale-avenue and Park-street
drawbridges afforded splendid places of
vantage for those who witnessed the
regatta.
In the first race the freshmen led the
sophomores from start to finish and
came in three lengths ahead. There
was no time taken.
In the second race the Juniors were
easily distanced by the seniors. The
latter, knowing they had easy game,
toyed with their opponents and con
served their strength for the struggle
with the freshmen. They crossed the
line three lengths ahead of the Juniors,
the time being five minutes and twen
ty-five seconds.
The seniors got away badly in the
race with the freshmen, but soon
evened ud matters and when the dis
tance had been half gone over the
crews were going along like a double
team. Then the freshmen made a
spurt that placed them a length to the
good. When Tuller caught his unfor
tunate "crab" the freshmen were
slightly in the lead and pulling
strongly.
The crews were made up as follows:
Seniorsâ E. A. Bannister, captain and
stroke; D. M. Evans, No. 3; G. J. An
loff. No. 2; E. V. Dodge. No. 1; J. P.

STRIKE CRISIS
FAST NEARING
ST. PETERSBURG. March IS. â
The industrial problem in St. Peters
burg again enters upon a difficult
stage, owners of many factories hav
ing, in consequence of continued
"backing and fllllng" by their em
ployes, decided to close down their
works entirely, locking out 30,000
men. The idle workmen are in an ugly
frame of mind. The machinery In one
of the big cotton mills was wrecked,
yesterday and disorder is in the air.
Trouble is expected and it is be
lieved the wilder spirits are now with
out bombs and other weapons of de
fense and reprisal. Guard officers con
tinue to receive warnings tbat they
will sign their death warrants if they
order the troops to fire, and a social
democratic propaganda of demonstra
tion and disturbance is evident.
The proprietors of the cotton mills
and woolen mills, which have been
operating on the smallest possible
margin of profit, are generally plan
ning to pay off and discharge their
employes, trying, with the aid of the
authorities, to send them back to the
villages.
It is openly stated among the work
men that the fighting wing of the so
cial revolutionists has passed a sen
tence of death on thirty high person
ages, the list being headed with the
names of Grand Duke Alexis an.l end
ing with that of the Emperor and
bearing also the name of the Dowager
Empress.

GRANDEST MARINE VIEW LOTS IN
â¢ THE CITY.
Sutro - Heights Addition Is the connecting
link between the -Golden Gate Park and Sutro
Heights. "
It comprises seven blocks between Fulton
street and Sutro Heights avenue, 46th and 49th
avenues, and is surely the most unique tract
of land ever offered In subdivisions. ' '
This Is the only property adjacent to the
ocean and Golden Gate Park where streets are
on official grades and macadamized.
SEWER, WATER AND GAS MAINS LAID.
Grandest marine view property in ' all the
city; no other city in. the United -States or
perhaps In the world affords residence sites
with such elevation, unobstructed marine and
scenic views., and so close to the pleasure
grounds of the people. It faces the Golden
Gate Park, the ocean, and adjoins Sutro
Heights, Sutro Baths and Cliff House.
This is not' the marine i view - advertised so
indiscriminately â marine view at a great
distance, a i mile or two off, but it is ' the
grandest marine view of the ocean, only - a
few hundred feet from your lot. " You have It
right in front of you, you can see and hear
the rolling and roaring of the breakers of "he
great Pacific. . â¢ â¢ 'â .'*â :.+â 
ALL LARGE LOTSâ 3O- foot frontagesâ the
special feature of this tract, as it gives oppor-
tunity for a better class of residences. Several
beautiful â¢ lines are contracted for and will
be in course of construction shortly.
Did you ever realize thit there are only a
few blocks north of Golden Gate Park so near
the ocean and that every lot sold means a
choice lot less to be had and makes yours
more valuable?.
Buy one of these lots for a home,
. for an Investment,
for speculation.
Buy one NOW, for there Is sure a time to
come when you cannot.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALC, SUNDAY, MARCH 26, 1905.
HOW PEOPLE GOT AIXJNG
IN THE "GOOD OLD TIMES"
Many of Our Modern Convenience*
and Necessities Were
Unknown.
Not until February of 181* did the
people of Kentucky know that Madi
son was elected President in the previ
ous November.
In 1884 one of the leading railroad*
of the United States printed on its
timetable: "The locomotive will leave
the depot every day at 10 e'clock if
the weather is fair."
The first typewriter was received by
the public with suspicion. It seemed
! subversive of existing conditions. A
reporter who took one into a court
room first proved its real worth.
In England some centuries ago, if
an ordinary workman, without permis
sion, moved from one parish to an
other in search of work or better
wages, he was branded with a hot
iron.
When Benjamin" Franklin first
thought of starting a newspaper in
Philadelphia, many of his friends ad
vised against it because there was a
paper published In Boston. Some of
I them doubted that the country would
: be able to support two newspapers.
One hundred years ago the fastest
I land travel In the world was on the
I Great North road, in England, after It
! had been put into its best condition.
i There the York mail coach tore along
1 at the rate of ninety miles a day, and
; many persons confidently predicted
j divine vengeance on such unseemly
haste.
When Thomas Jefferson was elected
President of the United States, on Feb
ruary 17, 1801, after one of the most
exciting political campaigns in our
h'story, the gratifying news did not
reach the successful candidate for as
many days as it now takes hours to
transmit the result of a presidential
election to the whole civilized world.
When, in 1809, Richard Trevithick
uttered the following words there
were many who considered him an in
sane, dangerous person: "The present
generation will use canals, the next
will prefer railroads with horses, but
their more enlightened successors will
employ steam carriages on railways
as the perfection of the art of con
veyance."
When Benjamin Franklin first took
the coach from Philadelphia to New
Ycrk he spent four days on the jour
ney. He tells us that, as the old driver
jogged along, he spent his time knit
ting stockings. Two stage coaches and
eight horses sufficed for all the com
merce that was carried on between
Boston and New York, and in winter
the journey occupied a week.
Napoleon, at the height of his
power, could not command our every
day conveniences, such as steam heat,
running water, bath and sanitary
plumbing, gas, electric light, railroads,
steamboats, the telegraph, the tele
phone, the phonograph, daily news
papers, magazines and a thousand
other blessings which are now part of
thu daily necessities of even manual
laborers.
When the first two tons of anthra
cite coal were brought into Philadel
phia, In 1803, the good people of that
city, so the records state, "tried to
burn the stuff; but, at length dis
gusted, they broke it up and made a
walk of it." Fourteen years later
Colonel George Shoemaker sold eight
or ten wagon loads of it in the same
city, but warrants were soon issued
for his arrest for taking money under
false pretenses." â Success.
Long Walk on Wager.
A. D. Buck, a civil engineer of De
troit, Mich., haa started from St.
Louis to walk to New Orleans. This
because he lost a wager made last
month in his home city. He and a
friend were discussing the Chicago-
Michigan University football game,
which was about to be played. Buck
agreed should the Chicago men lose
to walk from St. Louis to New Orv
leans. Having lost the wager, he is
now en route between the cities
named. He is to receive $80 a month
for the time he is away, and if he
completes his walk within ninety days
he will receive double p%y. He start
ed without a cent in his pocket and
must pick up a living as best he can. â
Chicago Chronicle.
"Engaged to Jack! Why, you're the
fourth girl he's been engaged to this
summer."
"Well, don't you think there must
be something very attractive about a
man who can get engaged to four girls
In about two months?" â London
Punch.

SAN ROSSORE A REAL
HOME OF BOTAI/TT
Mairnificent Estate of the Kinc Â°*
Italy and Some of Ita
Unique Treasure* .
San Rossore, where the tallan royal
family pasa their autumn month*, la,
without -exception, the most beau
tiful estate owned by the house
of Savoy. it extends from Viar
reggio to Livorno, at the foot of the
Apuan Alps, combining- the charm of
the seashore with the attractions of
the mountains. Formerly it belonged
to the Archbishops of Pisa, from
whom the Grand Dukes of Tuscany
purchased it and made it state prop
erty, which explains how it wai that
in 1860, at the time of the annexation
of Tuscany to the kingdom of Italy,
it ranked as one of the gems in the
civil list of Victor Emmanuel 11. The
Grand Dukes resided there the greater
part of the year, and one. Leopold 11,
built extensive farmhouses, within
which are numerous breeding animals.
About these farms are wideapreading
fields, where still horses, "oxen, cows,
sheep and buffalo graze in peace. San
Rossore comprises also extensive cul
tivated fertile lands; but the greater
part of it â and that is its essential
characteristic â is the thickly planted
woodlands, which yield an important
revenue from the sale of Its pine trees.
In these woods game is most plentiful;
while in the lakes, ponds and small
streams there is any quantity of fresh
water fish. At San Rossore one can
Indulge in almost any sport, for there
are wild boar, stags, reindeer, pheas
ants, partridges and almost every
species of inland water fowl.
Of all the curiosities at San Rossore,
the most curious, undoubtedly, are the
camels used for the purpose of re
moving the timber. These camels are
not by any means ordinary camels.
They are historical camels, and would
be proud of It were they conscious of
It, for It is said their ancestors figured
in the Crusades. History tells us that
these animals were brought from
Syria to Pisa in galleys which the
Plsan republic had dispatched to the
Holy Land for the purpose of bringing
back a load of the mold from the
grave of Christ. It was supposed that
this mold had the peculiarity of ab
sorbing the bodies burled in it. The
Plsans intrust**! with the mission of
bringing it" over evidently thought that
they could not do better when It was
shipped on board the galleys than to
embark as well the camels which had
been laden with it. These camels were
sent on to San Rossore. They pros
pered and multiplied there and it Is
their descendants which are used for
the purpose of shifting the timber
from the royal demesne.
With regard to the dogs in the ken
nels at San Rossore, every breed in use
for sporting purposes has been per
petuated there, from the remotest
medieval times. They have their hos
pital, as well as a small cemetery, with
Its accompanying tombstones, on
which are recorded the names of the
dogs which had their fleeting hours of
celebrity in the hunting field. With
regard to tfhe chateau Itself, it is of
somewhat modest appearance and di
mensions, but it contains numerous
works of art of priceless value.
Victor Emmanuel II spent much of
his spare time at San Rossore between
1864 and 1870 â that is to say. at the
t'me when his capital was at Florence
and not at Rome. In 18G8 the King
became very ill, and so serious was his
condition that the Bishop of Pisa was
sent for to hear his confession. The
prelate came in haste and thought to
profit by the opportunity to ask him
to make certain political concessions.
"Eminence," said the King, "if you
want ot speak about affairs of state
you will find my Ministers in the next
room; oblidge me by going there." â

Where It Grows, Its Value and How
It Is Prepared for ship

The United States is not a mahogany
growing country, unless Cuba may
now be said to be a part of the United
States. It is a tropical wood. Its
home is in Central America and in Cu
ba. Jamaica and Santo Domingo.
These Islands give the smallest but
heaviest ancl prettiest wood. British
Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua
give the most and Mexico the largest
timber. The richer, solid, heavy va
rieties come from the islands. These
will not float. They are susceptible of
a high polish, and the wood has a rich,
wavy figure. The pretty figured pieces
of wood are of great value. A six-foot
piece (which included* the crotch of a
tree) in a certain shipment will bring
about $DOO when cut Into veneers.
No matter where a shipment of the
wood comes from, or what variety it is,
there are always more or less of the
fine, flaky sticks that make veneer.
Mahogany is a phenomenal wood in
that it does not warn under any condi
tions of weather, use or age; neither
does it shrink. It is of great beauty,
hardness and durability. In no other
wood can these qualities be found com
bined with large size, uniformity of
grain and richness of color and figure.
The island timbers are eight to ten
feet In length by twelve inches in
diameter, 6ome from Cuba, however,
reaching thirty-five feet in length by
two feet in diameter. Honduras
squared Umbers are as long as forty
feet by two feet in diameter, and the
three-foot and four-foot timbers come
from Mexico. The softer mahogany
comes from the swampy lands. There
are no mahogany forests; the trqes are
not grouped that way, the individual
trees being more or less widely sep
arated. Like other trees, the core Is
the poorest part, often being worthless.
A schooner load represents an ex
penditure of about $13,000. That is not
all for the timber, labor and freight,
a considerable part of it representing
"grease" to the Spanish customs offi
cer, whose favor is not obtained by a
smile. There are no saw-mills in the
mahogany-growing countries. The
trees when cut down are squared by
hand. An Indianapolis company is go
ing to have them hewn Into octagon

Infecting Field Mice.
Field mice are as great a nuisance
in many parts of Europe as prairie
dogs are in some parts of the West, or
as rabbits are in Australia. Until re
cently no effective means was known
for combating this mouse plague, but
since resort was had to the infection
method large areas have been syste
matically cleared of the pest. Ths
virulent culture is that of the organ
ism known as the mouse typhus,
about which there is some contention
that it is identical to the similarly
named disease in man. It was feared
that the adoption of this method
would result in the infection of fowis
and other farm animals, but these ap
prehensions appear to have been
groundless. â Philadelphia Record.

RULER CHOSEN
BY BIRTH SIGNS
In Grand Lama of Thibet
Is Snpposed to Dwell Soul
of His August Predecessor
HOLY CHILD HONORED
Supreme Vicegerent of Budd
ha on Earth Has Grand Pal
aceâlnvisible to Strangers
No living white man, unless Colonel
Tounghusband has found htm, has
even seen the grand lama of Thibet,
who haa shut himself up, the telegrama
say, for three years.
Dominating the mysterious city, thÂ«
forbidden land whose gates are open-
Ing to the world, is the palace of the
young priest king. Set on a hill which
cannot be hid, rising In the center nine
stories high, the golden roofs of the
Potala palace would draw the first
gaze of the first white man who car
ried the British flag to this corner of
the earth, In which It had never before
been unfurled. *
The world has heard little of him
except that he loves Russia, hates
China and has great contempt for Eng
land. He has no authority for sitting
among the world's kings save that a
Buddhist theory puts him there.
Humbly born, 28 years old, with no
great gifts of his own, Tubdangyamtso
is ruler of Thibet because a strange
sign at his birth, real or imagined,
marked him out as the child in whom
the soul of the previous ruler had been
reborn. So, not long ago, the little
son of a poor fuel seller came to the
throne of Thibet; so for centuries have
the destinies of-the mountain kingdom
fallen into the hands of a little child.
BUDDHIST LEGENDS.
Long ago, when Charles Stuart wai
being driven from his throne in Eng
land, a dalai lama was raised to the
throne of Thibet by a Mongol prince
whom he had called in to conquer the
land. The Chinese Emperor let go his
hold on Lhasa and gave the ambitious
priest the title which his successors
have keDt ever sinee â the title of dalai
lama, "the great gem of majesty."
When the grand lama died his soul,
the Buddhists say, was born again in
another child, and so from age to age
the eternal life of the dalai lama goes
on.
Almost before his eyes were opened,
though his mother and father knew It
not, the dalai lama was destined for
the palace on the red hill. Some sign
at his birthâ once it was the sound of
music, at another time the dropping
of milk upon the pillars of the house
determined the choice. But there were
other signs and other children and for
a few years it was not known in
Thibet whether Tubdangyamtso would
be dalai lama or a common Thibetan's
son.
Then the names of the three chil
dren whose births had been attended
with miraculous signs were placed in
an urn, each Inscribed upon a slip in
Chinese and Thibetan characters, and
at a solemn service in the presence
of the people and all the lamas the
dalai lama was chosen by lot, placing
it "beyond a doubt that the actual and
genuine embodiment of the dalai lama
has appeared in the world, and the
yellow church has a ruler for its gov
ernance."
Henceforth the child's home was at
the palace, the palace into which no
woman must go. His parents were
given a residence for life about a mile
away, the mother seeing her son In cer
tain hours, the father being raised to
high rank. At 4 years old the dalai
lama was enthroned; at 8 he was or
dained a monk and head of the church;
at 18 he took into his own hands the
reins of government. For ten years
Tubdangyamtso has ruled in Lhasa,
yet he is still a youth of 28.
There are not many more pathetic
sights on earth than the sight of a
dalai lama seated on his throne. For
generations the grand lamas have been
mere boys; many of them are said to
have died mysterious deaths. It is, at
best, a sad enough life. Manning, the
last Englishman to see a grand lama,
now ninety years ago, could think of
nothing else but the beautiful face of
the doomed child. He could feel, he
said, the tears in his eyes. Yet this
child was ruler of Thibet, with a pal
ace bigger than the Vatican and an
environment as gorgeous as that of a
King.
There is a man living in India who
has seen the dalai lama, the first and
last man to enter his presence In dis
guise, and he brought away from the
forbidden city the same sad picture as
the Englishman.
IMPRESSIVE SCENE.
He sat three rows from the throne
at a reception by the dalai lama in
the grand hall in which the state of
ficials "walked from left to right with
a gravity becoming their exalted rank
in the presence of the supreme vice
gerent of Buddha on earth." The
dalai lama was 8 years old, seated on
a great altar, pillared on lions of
carved wood and covered with costly
silk scarfs. He wore a yellow miter
over his head, his body was robed in
a yellow mantle and the child sat
cross-legged with the palms of his
hands joined in blessing.
Sarat Chandra Dasa, iiv the -few mo
ments he stood before the king-child,
was filled with sorrow for him. The
child had "a really bright and fair
complexion, with rosy cheeks."
His eyes were large and penetrating.
The thinness of his person was prob
ably owing to the fatigues of the cere
monies at the court, of his religious
duties and of ascetic observances to
which he had been subjected since tak
ing the vows of monkhood.
A steward poured tea into the dalai
lama's golden cup from a golden tea
pot and before he lifted the cup to
his lips a grace was solemnly chanted.
Then the steward placed a golden dish
full of rice In front of the child, whfch
he barely touched before the rice was
distributed.
After grace had been said the holy
child chanted a hymn in a low, indis
tinct voice, and a venerable gentleman
rose from the middle of the first row
of seats and, addressing the grand
lama as the Lord Avalokita Incarnate,
recited many deeds of mercy which
that patron saint of Thibet had vouch
safed toward its benighted people. At
the conclusion he thrice prostrated
himself before his holiness, when a
solemn pause followed, after which the
audience rose and the grand lama re
tired.
The dalai lama, in truth, is an au
tocrat hardly less absolute on his tiny
stage than the Czar.
He rules his kingdom in Central
Asia, eight times as big as Great
Britain, but with a population no larg
er than London's, from one of the
noblest palaces in the world. His cap
ital stands higher than Mount Etna
above the level of the sea. and the
approach to the palace through an av
enue of trees is a wonderful sight from
the town. The dalai lama, did he. choose
to shelter all the monks in Lhasa in
his own house, could give each one a
separate room, and there are thou
sands of monks In the city. The Po
tala palace is greater than the palace
SINGLE STICK
FOR LADIES
Cane Defense, Once so Popu
lar With Men* Now Coming
Into Favor With Women
EXERCISE AND UTILITY
Art Is More Useful Than
Fencing, as the Club Will
Ward Off Heavy Attacks
With the increase of physical cul
ture the theory becomes more gener
ally accepted that physical exercise
merely as such is not nearly so valu
able as that which is to an appreci
able degree incidental to the accom
plishment of a definite object, some
thing which keeps the mind as well as
the muscles in play and working to
ward the same end. In other words,
and to come down to a concrete ex
ample, bedroom calisthenics and in
numerable similar exercises, while
well enough In their way, do not do
as much good as many games which
combine pleasure with practice.
The explanation of this is that ex
ercises which mean nothing to the
mind and which are gone through
with mechanically call for no real ex
ertion of the muscles and while the
muscles may nevertheless be benefited
and made alert by mere motion they
are not such ready and responsive ser
vants of the brain as when they are
trained to do what the brain requires
and is striving to accomplish.
In calisthenics the mind may be
far away, but In such work as box
ing, rowing, tennis and the like it is as
active as the body and the culture is
really mental as well as physical. The
motion is suited to the thought.
KEEPS FIGURE TRJM.
It is to a general realixatlon of the ',
soundness of this theory that physical
culturists attribute the great increase
in the popularity of fencing with '
women. In addition to fulfilling the
conditions described it is further de- [
slrable for women because it brings
Into play Just those muscles of the j
waist and hips which if not exercised
tend to make fat rapidly and in a way
that is disfiguring and it gives
strength and firmness and elasticity 1
without causing that abnormal and ;
unequal development of muscle which
!â  unfeminine and greatly feared by !
women who devote much time to !
physical culture.
Still another of its advantages is
that in so far as it involves a contest
for supremacy with another mind it
Imparts self-confidence and courage
and a power for rapid thought.
While these considerations are per
haps sufficient in themselves there is
still another and a queer cause. In the
opinion of Professor William J. Her
mann, a well known authority on
physical culture, for the great and in
creasing vogue for fencing among
women. Professor Hermann says that
the pastime first began when "A Gen
tleman of France " first appeared, and
since then there has been at least one
successful novel a year to fan that
flame.
More than one of the novels, too. In
which the heroine of some other like
ly figure carries her fortunes forward
through an ability to wield the rapier,
has been dramatized and the beauty |
of the exercise all the more realistic
ally demonstrated in consequence.
Most actresses, indeed, now include
fencing as a regular part of their
training and this alone tends to make
it generally popular. \
Many Philadelphia women are now '
so proficient in the art of fencing that
t^iey are going forward to other but
clcsely related forms of the exercise,
and among these "cane defense" is
rapidly coming to the front as giving
all that the use of the foil does, and
having, besides, a practical utility, for
the pastmistress of cane defense can
pick up a stick of any kind and "put
out" a man who is not similarly armed
or equally expert. Her self-confidence
is .even greater than that of the tencer,
for she has learned to work with the
kind of tool that may be had at a
moment's notice.
â¢ The chief difference between cane
practice and that with the foil is that
a stroke or blow is substituted for the ,
thrust. It is closely allied to and an
offspring, perhaps, of "single-stick,"
an exercise in which President Roose
velt has recently made himself profl
cent.
WHERE TO STRIKE.
It was at first thought that it would
be too heavx and strenuous for wom
en, but the cane used may be of as
light a weight as desired, and the
strength of wrist required Is less,
rather than greater, than in fencing.
Aside from parrying the blows of an
adversary similarly armed, the expert
ness of cane defense develops chiefly.,
in placing the blow at the exact point*
dt-sired and with just the desired force.
With a blow on the chin, for instance,
a man may be knocked out with a
comparatively light cane and without
any injury of a lasting character.
Tet. with all this, the exercise is
just as valuable as fencing when the
actual use of it as a means of self
dffense is not thought of. It cultivates
the same muscles in the same way and
brings the same mental control. As
in fencing, the use of the weapon in
either hand can and, Indeed, alwa>s
should be taught.
The costume for cane defense exer
cise is similar to that for single-stick,
with the sides of the head and shoul
ders and arms well protected, for it la
to these points that the blows are prin
cipally directed.
The science of defense, as well as of
attack. Is looked after In cane defense,
and an expert can protect herself
aeainst an adversary whose mere brute
strength is much greater. With this,
too, is Incorporated the principle, more
highly developed in the American
school than any other, of immediate
return, whereby the pupil, having re
ceived and parried a blow, at once
follows up the parry with a blow of
her own. Cane defense Is a pretty ex
ercise to look at, graceful and full of
suppleness, and to the inexpert spec
tator it is a marvel.
It would not be interesting to go here
into the methods of cane defense in
detail. All the positions and passes
that belong to fencing are taught and
In so far as the Instruction Is desig
nated for practical application, partic
ular stress !s laid on side-stepping, the
strokes at the head and on the jaw
and the use of the double-handed
guard, which permits the shifting of
the cane into whichever hand is most
convenient for an effective return The
ability to use either hand is particu
larly insisted on.â Philadelphia Record

Bank Robbers Find It Wasta

Charge of Dynamite Needed

Work Ruin to Building
Merchants are robbed; th* safes at
country banks that carry a surplus of
perhaps $10,000 or $20,000 are often rtd
dled by burglars. How Is it that thÂ«
mllliona quietly reposing within the
doors of scores of banks In the larger
cities are never attempted? For It !â¢
a fact that during the last twenty- flyÂ«
years no attack, successful or other
wise, has been madÂ© on any bank
vault In the United States In citiea
of over 60.000 Inhabitants. Most of
the bank robberies occurring to-day
take placÂ« in towns of 2500 to 7500 In
habitants. In the larger cities, whers
the treasure really is. no one even
attempts to rob a bank. Why is this?
Money can protect money. That is
the whole secret. The country banks
depend on safes costing perhaps a few
hundred dollars; a great city bank
spends perhaps $150,000 for Its burglar
and fire proof vaults. And these vaults
are proof. They are absolutely un
assailable. The guarding of a bank s
money has been reduced to such a
science that a banker, having one*
taken the proper precautions, never
gives the matter a further thought,
though he has millions of dollars with
in his doors.
The flreprooflng for a large vault can
be constructed for from $10,000 to $15.
000. It is the burglar-proof steel lin
ing that brings the cost of vault con
struction up to the six-figure mark.
HEAVY WATERPROOF DOORS.
Think of a steel door weighing twelv#>
tons or a hinge alone weighing one
ton. When that door consists of ten
inches of drillproof steel, plate lapped
on plate, do you wonder that even th*
most daring burglar has never at
tempted it? Such a great door usually
has some four and twentr-two or
three inch steel bolts which shoot out
automatically in four directions as soon
as the door is closed. The entire clos
ing of the door is absolutely water
tight. The closing has actually been
tested one whole night under water.
This closing is one of the "tongue and
groove" variety and the groove is
packed with packing.
This formidable door Is furnished
with a time lock that can oÂ« set for
any number of hours and that can
not be opened until the hour for which
It is set arrives. The door is furnish
ed with perhaps three duplicate tim
ers, so that if two should fail to work
there would still be one to open the
door
Inside the great door a massive grat
ing called the day srate gives access
to the vault. To this chamber, which,
with Its four- inch walls of drillproof
steel, is worthy of Vulcan himself
only the active officials of the bank
have entrance. Here are the tellers'
safes where they keep the money for
the days business.
PILES OF GOLD AND NOTES.
Here are bags of gold, $5000 in
eaoh. piled up like so many bags of
buttons, each bag being securely tied
and sealed. Here are packages of
bills stacked ud like bricks. The ones
and twos in $1000 packages and the
tens and twenties in $10,000 packages.
The bills In each of these packages
have been counted, tied up and sealed
by two persons in the presence of each
other, so that the bank can guarantee
the amounts as given on the labels
without recounting. Here, inside the
tellers' safes, are compartments where
the collateral received for loans to deÂ»
positors is kept.
But this is only the outer division
of the vault chamber; beyond it is in.
other massive grating dividing the
vault Into two rooms. Xo single offi
cial can penetrate to the inner shrine.
and one of the two officials necessarily
present must be a director of the
bank. Here is the holy of holies, when*
repose the reserve funds of the bank
â millions of gold and paper money.
The reserve funds are kept in safes on
which the locks are timed to open
every morning, so that if necessary the
bank tellers could have the money at
a moment's notice.
BIG SAFES IMPREGNABLE.
The two divisions of the vault form
really one chamber with walls at
drill-proof steel. The walls are drill
proof, vet as a matter of fact the u;>^
to-date burglar does not work with
drills. A few sticks of dynamite, some
nitroglyeertn in a bottle, with alcohol,
putty, candles, wires, wire nipper*
an exhaust pump are the prin
items in his outfit. With these tools
he often "makes an impression" on â 
small safe. But a single charge of
dynamite heavy enough to open thÂ»
Joints of a big vault would wreck ths
whole building.
Unlimited time, therefore, in whicU
to work would be necessary to tMt
successful wrecking of a drill-pmof
vault by explosives. For it would b*
necessary to use a long successi.
small charges; to work patiently at
plate after plate, and the conditions
make this absolutely impossible. Th*
reason such great pains are taken ta
make all Joints water tight is to |
against the introduction of nitro
glycerln, which has about the co:
ency of honey or common glycerin.
Nltroglyserln is not effective unless It
Is inside the safe or vault.
The entire great steel room is made
fire-proof by being inclosed In
or tile or cement walls, between which
and the steel walls is an air space four
or five Inches thick. Air is a non
conductor of heat and being Inter*
posed between the brick anÂ«l
walls prevents the latter from bi
Ing overheated. So perfect is the pro
tection that even when a building haÂ»
been destroyed the contents of the
vaults within have remained un
changed. â Philadelphia Inquirer.

COTTONâ The market was quiet to-day.
Every one seems to be waiting the final gin
r.ers' report, to be Issued next Tuesday, and.
as slated before, if It comes to 13.500,000 to
1*. 000, 000 bales wÂ« may hay* a decline tem
porarily. Price* are now town about thirty
points ob the average from the top. and it
look* as though the market will continue to
drag until after the ginners* report Is an
nounced. We do not, however, expect to see
an}' extensive selling movement or weakness
develop in the near future, as the South has
demonstrated her ability to carry over the
surplus of the crop Into next seasos If neces
sary la order to realize what Is regarded as a
reasonably fair price for the staple and also
on account of the extensive short interest
* such still exists In the May and July options,
and the fact that contract stock at New York
1* now <Jowr. to only 67.000 bales, against
71,000 two months ago.
COTTER â immediate course of the mar
ket win depend to a great extent on the move
ment of the crop In Brazil. If the receipts
continue heavy there will be further liquida
tion and a lower range of prices will be
reached temporarily at least, aa th* movement
of the crop to Rio end Santos will undoubt-.
edly be the dominating influence in general
t^atlraer.t for the next week or two. Mean
while spot coffee here Is quiet and steady.
COPPERâ Bo*-. March 25. âThe market
to-day developed unexpected strength and ac
tivity ail through the list. The trading m
Copper Range was large. A. C. Burr-ace, one
of the large holders of Old Trip Mountain was
reported seriously 111 last night, and this
caused some selling of the Mock, but he was
reported, much better to-day, and all stock
was quickly taken at advancing prices. The
entire market looks well and higher prices
should be recorded next week.
Dried Frulte in New York.
Mall advices from New York say:
â¢"The unsettled, and even weak, feelinc In
the California seeded Raisin market, which
hag prevailed for some time pact as a result
of dull trade and a desire on the part of a
cumber of holders to clean up their stocks
before the cÂ£iid-noraÂ«e season arrives. ap
â ptared to be giving place to a better tone at
the close of last week. It was believed that
the cheap lots are now pretty well out of the
' way, for. while there were known to be buy
ers for fancy Coast reeded at 5%,e. there 'were
apparently no -â¢.iers at lee* than 6Kc. and
that was paid !n several Instances, though the
â largest reported sale was of 250 cases. Ad
vice* from up the State were to the effect
that Jobbers there are entirely out of stock
la many Instances, and an early improvement
la demand from that quarter If confidently
expected. A feature of some Interest noted on
Saturday was the sale of a carload of a epe
cial brand of fresh seeded fancy, for Imme
diate shipment from the Coast to an Interior
Jobber, at the full price of Â«c f. o. b. Acâ
cording to advice* from the Coast received on
Saturday the remaining stock of Prunes dees
not exceed 300 carloads, and the tone there
v-as said to be firmer. In thi* market business
was only fair and on the hand-to-mouth order.
at price* which have been current for same
time past. There is some Inquiry for 4O*
and â¢>-. but 50s now seem to be the favorite
else with local buyers. Nothing new ie re
ported concerning Peaches and Apricots. Both
are In light supply and held at prices which
keep business within very narrow limits. Cur
rants receive little attention, but holders do
not seem inclined to make any further con
cession. Figs are In Increasing demand and
the market closed very firm, with the prob
ability of an early advance, as stocks are re
ported to be retting into email compass. The
demand for Persian Dates 1* unusually good
for thÂ» season, and prices are held firmly
up to the quotations." . ... .

Future Grain ; arid Provisions.
; CHICAGO, â¢ March 28.â Rumors of ia ; revirt.l
of the bull campaign In May wheat had a
strengthening effect on the wheat I market %in |
general here to-day. - At the close May wheat
was up.. %c. . . July ,â¢' is ,; . up .- %c. May . corn j
showed a gain of U@%c. Oats are off %osieV
. and 'provisions are. almost unchanged. ..;/ /â 
As a result. of higher 'prices i at \ Liverpool, â 
the - wheat market \ here â  . had 1 a firmer . ton* i
at the opening. May was ; unchanged to %c I
higher at ?1*12%Â©1- 12%. July was up a
shade to H&%a at 90%Â©90% c. The excellent :
outlook for the ; new crop; however, 5 Induced
some selling of July, and in consequence that !
option declined to uOUc'-Maay operators were â 
considerably disturbed by rumors that the May
deal was not yet finished, â¢ and . that it was the
intention of a Wall street coterie to force the
price of that option to a mucn higher level. '
The fact " that one oorf r the recognized leaders
of the Eastern speculators - was -in -Chicago
yesterday gave some , emphasis to such gossip
In addition to the revived interest In: the May
option, advices from Minneapolis claimed that ;
there was a good demand rrom elevators and;;
millers for all- grades or cash -. wheat.* The
eftect of excellent weather conditions was com- |
pletely offset, market becomlng-qulte bullish.
May was in good 'demand; but offerings were
extremely light: â¢ From $1 13. the -price of â¢ that -
option advanced to $1 14 : without a single
sale.' -At $1 14 commission houses 'sold mod
erately and the . price reacted somewhat. â  A
belief that July had been largely : oversold .l
caused' fair buying of: that option late In the]
day. The market closed strong, .with â , May '
at $1 13%. Final quotations on July were at
90&i<@Â«0%C. â  , â¢ -â  â  ' ' r ;
Influenced by the strength of "wheat .: the
corn ' market exhibited 1 considerable .- firmness.
May â  opened unchanged to a. shade lower ' at ,
4S%c. to.4S%Â®<S%c, sold between 4S%S4BV"Â»c
and 40c and closed at the highest point..
A liberal movement and a near approach of
the feeding season caused selling of oats by
cash houses, and the result was a weak mar
ket. May opened unchanged to %c lower at
30%@3054c, sold off to 30% c and closed at 30%

Potatoes. Onions and Vegetables.
..As is. generally the case at the end of the
week, there was very little doing in the mar
ket for old Potatoes and Onions and prices
stood as previously quoted. As previously men
tioned, the market is slenderly supplied with
really fancy table Burbanks. and. should the
stock brought from Oregon by the strainer St.
Paul run .high In grade, prices, are likely to
'advance. . â¢ Â-..-.
'.'â¢â¢ Trade in miscellaneous vegetables was brisk,
there being a good shipping demand' in addi
! tion .to the regular local trade. Nearly 2000
.boxes- of Asparagus cams in, but the heavy
receipts were readily, absorbed, - surplus stocks
. of the lower grades being cleaned up by can
ncre at 4@sc per pound. Peas did better under
'decreased receipts., while Rhubarb was weak
for the general run. String Beans, Egg Plant
â¢ and Tomatoes from Southern California were
cheaper, 'supplies being more plentiful and
generally of poor quality. .

j - Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
There are " large orders on the market for !
full-weight Butter for the north. Light
weights are not wanted for this business . if
full weights can be had, as Oregon has a law
requiring Butter package weights to be in even
pounds, hence Portland will not take our lVi
ib squares. . Washington, too, will not take
them if it can get the . full-weight squares. As
this northern business- is : very important and
helps this market out of many a hole when It
gets . overloaded, it would seem .to be nothing
moro than common business sense for our But
i ter producers to put up their goods in full
; weight squares. .-. The : market is ' steady In the
face of heavy receipts iin consequence of these
northern orders â¢ - â  ;
There is nothing new in Cheese.
The Egg market continues liberally supplied
and quiet, with .* the tendency still ; downward.
Dealers are complaining of the general dull
ness and heavy - stocks.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
ADVANCE
Opening of Transatlantic
Wireless Service
â  The return of Mr. Marconi to this country on March 30th fives every
assurance that the opening, of the wireless service with England is near at
hand. The cable charge between the United States and England is 25 cents
a word: the wireless charge 10 cents. It Is reasonable to expect that the
public will favor the cheaper rate. In addition to Increasing largely the
Company's assets, this . Transatlantic Station will return to the MARCONI
COMPANY a net profit sufficient to pay 12% per cent dividend. . With-..14,
â  such Transatlantic Stations, paralleling the 14 cables, the net profit would
be over $1(^000.000, thereby increasing the dividend to 150 per cent..
- In view of this fact, which will bo a great event in the world's history,
and on account of the extraordlnaiy development of the system during the
past twelve months, the price of Marconi Securities will
Advance 20 Per Cent
* These securities have already Increased 100 per cent in value, a greater
increase than any other security In the same time. Many readers of this
advertisement had the opportunity a few years ago. of in-resting In 801 l
Telephone stock and $100 Invested then has netted to date a profit of over
$200,000. Marconi Securities, taken NOW, offer equally as great an oppor-
tunity. 'â  - 1 ' '
FINAL NOTICE
â As we desire all the present stockholders and those who are interested
In ; these securities to be benefited by the advance. we advise you now of the
increase' in price that you may secure all you can before It takes place on
or before ' 'â â  .'

CONVICT MAKES
ESCAPE AT SEA
J. P. 31<>r<ran, a Convicted
Done Thief, Disappears
From the Steamer Corona
KOIM) To SAX QUENTIN
ITumboldt. Sheriff Search
ing Vessel for Han Who
Peril aps Jumped Overboard
J. P. Morgan, a convicted horse
thief* an ex-soldier and reputed bad
man, made his escape early yesterday
morning while on the high sea. from
Sheriff Brown of Humboldt County,
who was escorting the prisoner from
Eureka to San Quentin. At some time
between 3 and 5 o'clock, while the
Sheriff slumbered in a lower berth on
the caastlng steamer Corona, Morgan
climbed from the berth above his cus
todian's head, passed out into the
eight and since has not been seen. A
search of the Corona failed to uncov
er the missing convict. If Morgan
Jumped overboard he probably went
to sl speedy death.
Morgan was sentenced to serve four
years in San Quentin. He is a young
man of slight physique and appeared
to be reconciled to the fate meted out
to him by the hand of th.- law. Sizing
up his prisoner. Sheriff Brown decid
ed that it would be unnecessary to re
strain him. and Morgan was given the
liberty of -he ship.
PBISOVEP RISES EARiiY.
. his prisoner retired
latÂ«e Fridj Brown made him
self com: . t: a lower berth af
ward climb into the bed
above At 1:^0 a. m. Brown and his
prisoner exchanged words. Brown
said good-night and dropped into a
I sleep. About 3 a. m. Morgan
arose and went on deck. A watch
man apked him what he was doing up
at that hour and Morgan explained
he was chilly and would like a cup of
I â¢ . The watchman secured a mug
-reaming beverage and Mor
gan dcank it, thanked the watchman
and said good-night. A few minutes
the watchman encountered Mor
.'he horsethief explained
that he \va6 going to pace the deck
for a few minutes to let the coffee set
tle. Morgan walked to the after end
of the boat and that was the last the
watchn*. f him.
Brown awoke about 5 o'clock and
within a few minutes was searching
the steamer for his prisoner. High
and low he looked, but found no Mor
gan. The Corona signaled for the po
hc came in through the heads
and when the steamer reached Broad
wharf Detecive Coleman and a
squad from the Harbor police station
were there to receive her.
SEARCH IX VAIN.
Policemen were posted so that
man leaving the steamer came
under strict scrutiny. Officers Mc-
Gowan and Conlan, who know all
about ships and the habits of stow
aways, made another search of the
vessel. They looked into boats, peek
ed down ventilators and even exam
ined the interior of the smokestack.
In glory-hole and fireroom the sleuths
hod. They explored the shaft al
ley and groped into the darkest cor
ners of the hold. Grimy, hungry, but
without Morgan, they abandoned the
search after two hours' toil. Sheriff
Brown and Detective Colman accom
panied the Corona to Oakland, where
Fhe is discharging the balance of her
cargo. They believe that the missing
man, if he did not commit suicide, is
stowed away among the freight and
the law officers will not leave the
*team?r until she is empty, when they
â ft ill make another search.
At the time Morgan disappeared the
Corona was within two and a half
miles of shore. There was a good sea
running and even if provided with a
life preserver, it Is hardly possible
that a mar; of Morgan's physique
*ould be able to make his way to
land.
Brown has been Sheriff of Hum
boldt County for forty yean?. He has
brought many prisoners to this city,
but never before has he lost his man.
The next prisoner he brings from Eu
reka will wear handcuffs, leg irons,
an Oregon boot and if necessary a
Ftraitjacket. And Brown will sleep
with one eye or>en.

A neat litle brochure telling of
sights worth seeing in and around
Francisco has been issued by the
management of the Palace Hotel. The
printing is clear and there is a pleas-
Ing absence of advertising matter,
which usually obscures the real infor
mation looked for in a guide. The
only exception is a reference to the
Palare Hotel itself, and as that is one
of the sights of the city the guide cer
tainly would not be complete without

FIVE CHILDREN
ARE HYPNOTIZED
Special Dispatch to The Call.
EVERETT, -Wash.. March 25. â
Thorne Mason, a student ln the eighth
grade of the Garfleld School, has hyp
notized five younger members of his
class so that yesterday they chewed
wooden chips and thought they were
eating strawberries. Nearly every
member of his class has been hyp
notized by Mason, who is 15 years old.
He is one of the prize scholars of the
school.
The principal of the school was some
what horrified Friday to find Mason
conducting a hypnotic exhibition ln the
school. After the five youngsters, who
appear to be especially susceptible to
the boy's influence, had chewed the
chips, believing them to be straw
berries, they were commanded to play
upon ordinary sticks of firewood. They
obeyed. One appeared as if playing a
cornet, another a violin and another a
banjo. Mason was forced to restore his
subjects to their senses. They say they
cannot help themselves when Mason
looks at them.
