SENATE PROVIDES
FOR TWO STATES
New Mexico to Enter Alone
Indian Territory Will Be United
With Oklahoma, hut Arizona
Will Remain as It Is. >
AFTER a prolonged session, the Senate last night
passed the statehood bill in a form providing
for the admission of two new States, one to be
composed of Oklahoma and Indian Territory to
gether, and the other of New Mexico wjth its
present boundaries. Arizona was eliminated from
the measure and will retain its territorial status.
The main controversy centered about New Mexi
co. The amendment fathered by Senator Bard,
giving it separate statehood, was finally adopted.
WASHINGTON, Feb. After a con
tinuous session of nine hours, the Sen
ate to-night passed the Joint statehood
bill. As passed, the bill provides for
the admission of two States. It joins
Oklahoma and Indian Territory into
one State, to be called Oklahoma, and
edmlts New Mexico with its present
boundaries. â  Arizona was eliminated
from the bill.
The long session was characterized
by many surprises. Beginning prompt
ly at noon, the Senate proceeded to
consider the various amendments
which had been suggested in the Com
mittee on Territories. One of the first
of these taken up was the amendment
prohibiting the sale of intoxicating
liquors in what is now Indian Territory
for the next ten years and this was
displaced with c substitute offered by
Gallinger which extended the amend
ment to the entire State for a period
of twenty-one years, and this was
adopted.
The first surprise of the day came
lv-n the committee accepted Foraker's
amendment pn-viding for a separate
vote by each of the Territories of Ari
zona and New Mexico on the constitu
tion to be adopted by the proposed
State of Arizona. This provision had
f* arcely. bet n made - a *rt of th*Â» bill
when Bard presented his amendment,
which had been originally offered by
Patterson and which provided for the
admission of New Mexico â as a State
without the addition of Arizona. ' This
amendment proved to be the point
around which all the subsequent pro
ceedings of importance evolved. llt
was at first adopted by the close vote
of 42 t.f 40. This vote was taken while
the â¢ nate was sitting in committee of
the whole and was reversed in the Sen
ate proper by the tie vote of 38 to 3S.
I'KOVIDES FOR TWO STATES.
Subsequently the Senate decided by a
elope vote to entirely eliminate New
Mexico and Arizona from the bill, and
this result had hardly been announced
when Bard, in slightly changed form,
renewed his proposition for the admis-
Kiin of Xtw Mexico ' as a State, and
this time the amendment prevailed.
One of the affirmative votes was,
however, cast by- Beveridge. who was
in charge of the bill, for the purpose
of moving the reconsideration of the
vote. He was prompt in making the
motion as soon as the result was an
nounced, but the motion was laid on
the table. Th. effect was to eliminate
Arizona from the bill and to establish
a State of Xew Mexico and another of
Oklahoma and Indian Territory. In
this form the bill was passed.
I'AHAii; KlFi:i{i:\DlM.
mrprit in connection with
KM was the adoption of
I sugp. Â«t. d by Foraker,
piovi the submission of the
tution of the proposed State of
ten of the present
f Arizona and the Territory
- w Mexico â eparmteljr.
Beveridge had suggested that the
committee amendments should be
paaaed upon in order to perfect the
hill when Foraker secured recognition
to formally propose his amendment
This had for weeks been considered a
crucial amendment, and surprise was
depicted on many faces when it was
permitted to go to a vote without a
suggestion from any Senator. The sur
was no less when the supporters
ot the committee bill failed to demand
a division on the vote. Beveridge. in
ge of the bill, sat in his customary
on the front row of the Repub
lican side, hut made no sign. The re
pult created a ripple of excitement
throughout the Senate chamber, and
when it subsided B<veridge, on behalf
Â° committee, indicated his pur
pose of accepting several amendments
by Long. One of these prc
sr-ribed the proportion of the public
lands to be devoted to the benefit of
Th" higher institutions of learning In
the proposed State of Oklahoma.
The amendment suggested by Long,
increasing tho donation to the Okla
- Agricultural and Mechanical
cc from 150.000 acres to 250,000
s. was agreed to.
Bailey spoke in opposition to the
union of Oklahoma and Indian Terri
tory. He said that if Texas had had
Eufficient population in the beginning
It would in ail probability have been
divided into five States..
Carmack offered an amendment eli
â¢;ng- the provision in the bill re
quiring the adoption of a constitution
c State of Oklahoma, many of
of which shall be irre
vocable without the consent of the
T nited States. The amendment was
agreed to on a viva voce vote.
BARD FOR YEW MEXICO.
Bard then proposed an amendment.
ling for the admission of New
Mexico as a State with its present
boundaries, the effect being to elimin
" rizona as a part of the proposed
The amendment was formerly
â¢-ted by Patterson, and was of
fered as a substitute for the provision
in the bill admitting Arirona and New
Mexico as one State. The rending of
tke amendment consumed much time
The San Francisco Call.
and was followed with interest, as it
was realized that it probably would
furnish the first test vote of the day.
Bard explained the provisions of the
amendment and a number of Senators
s-poke for or against it. Among: the
Senators speaking: for the amendment
were Xewlands. Heyburn, Bailey, El
kins, Morgan, and among those op
posed to it were Hopkins and Spooner.
Spooner declared that it was idle to
compare New Mexico with the original
thirteen States.
"They did not come into the Union,"
he said, "they made the Union. New
Mexico is not fit to come into the i*n
tan. Her mineral resources are a
hagatelle, her agriculture a trifle; her
population is not such as to justify
admission. "'
XI.KINS DEFENDS PEOPLE.
Elkins. replying, said he had lived
in Xew Mexico for many years and
knew the people to be in every way
worthy of statehood. . He , said the
Democratic party was keeping its
pledges by supporting statehood for
Xtw Mexico, while the Republicans
were violating a pledge three times
made. - â  ' â  .
Dolliver opposed the amendment, ex
pressing the opinion that there could
never be a general civilization without
tain. /. v ââ¢;_ -.-.. ; ;->"- /^v-' ; '' --'j
"I have observed." he -said, "that

for New Mexico, as <lid TMler. Both

; cf New Mexico, saying that they com
pared favorably with the rural people
in other sections. Stewart and Clark
of Montana supported the amendment.
DANGER FROM I'OLVGAMY.
Burrows announced his opposition to
the admission of New Mexico and
based his antagonism on the revela
tions concerning liormotiumi which
have been made in the case of Senator
Bmoot before the Committee on Priv
ileges and Elections, of which he is
chairman.
"I cannot vote for tne admission of
Now Mexico." he said, "because to tak^
it out of the jurisdiction <>f the United
Ftates and lift It into statehood would
oe to remove the probability of bring
ing to iustice th>)SÂ« who are violating
the la .' .'
The bill as it stands, he said, recog
nizes the existence of the crime of
polygamy In New Mexico by prohibit
ing its practice, admitting that when
it becomes a sovereign State it may
remove the restriction and nullify it.
"This." he said, "brings us face to
face with a condition that should alarm
the country."
"Dof-F not the Senator's objection ap
ply with Just as much force to the ad
mission of a Stute composed of the two
Territories of Arizona and New Mex
ico as to the admission of New Mexico
alone*"' asked Bailey.
GOVERNMENT TO TAKE HAND.
Burrows admitted that it did, add
ing: "I will vote against the admis
sion of New Mexico alone or against
its admission coupled with Arizona.
The .condition with reference to polyg
amy is much worse in Arizona than in
New Mexico, and the conditions in both
are such as to restrain me from voting
for either. To-day polygamy exists in
New Mexico. Tt has been declared to
be the breeding ground of that prac
tice. I am in possession of informa
tion concerning the conditions in that
Territory which is absolutely startling.
I cannot now enter into particulars,
but I do want to call attention to the
conditions, and 1 say that, in my judg
ment, it would be a fatal mistake to
admit either or both Territories, and
1 believe the country at no distant time
would rue the step if taken. Neither
Territory should be admitted until this
abomination is wiped out."
Dubois, who is also a member of
the Committee on Privileges and
Elections, spoke for the admission of
New Mexico, saying that the revela
tions concerning polygamy made in the
Smoot case have been so startling that
the National Government will take con
trol of the question of polygamy in
the States as well as in the Terri
tories.
McComas also spoke of the revela
tions before the committee, and ex
pressed the opinion that in view of
them "far more effective strictures
than are now in force against poly
gamy are necessary." He opposed
separate statehood for New Mexico.
Platt of Connecticut said there was
no doubt about the power of Congress
to restrict polygamy, "an institution
which is," he said, "so inimical to our
future."
AMENDMENT CARRIED.
The vote on the amendment for the
separate admission of New Mexico was
then 'taken and it was carried, 42 to 40.
It was evident from the outset that the
vote would be close, and the progress
was followed with deep interest. Fol

Captain, Four Passengers
and Many ol the
Crew Perish.
Loss of the Dcmara During a Blinding
Snow Storm Off the Nova
i co i ian Coast.
HALIFAX. N. S.. Feb. 7. -During a
raging and bunding snowsonn which
has swept the Nova Scotia <'oast for
the pn.st t\venty-f"Ur hours the ocean
steamship Dapiara of the Furnessia
line struck on the rocks at Mushuodo
boit. thirty miles east of Halifax, early
to-day and is believed to have foun
<Werl with the loss of many lives.
The first officer of th^ ship. with
eighteen of the crew, escaped in one
of the life boats and landed at Pleas
ant Point after a terrifir struggle with
wind and sea. Captain Gorst, mas
ter of the Pamara, four passengers
and the rest of the crew left the ves
sel in another life hoat. They have
not been heard of since and it is feared
that they have perished.
The occupants of the boat which
reached shore were utterly exhausted
and many of tnem were badly frost
bitten. They had n harrowing experi
ence, battling in the darkness for hours
in the open boats with tempestuous
seas on a treacherous coast with tho
thermometer registering 10 degrees be
low zero and an Arctic blizzard raging.
They landed on shore some time during
the day and reached the telegraph of
fice at Mushu'odoboit harbor to-night,
whence they wired the first news of
the disaster to the agents of the Fur
nessfa line at Halifax, to which port
the Damars was bound.
The survivors say that the steam
ship struck at about 2 o'clock thi^
morning, when the blizzard was so
thick that it was impossible to see a
ship's length ahead, on what proved to
be Mushuodoboit ledge, five miles from
the main land.
An immense hole, through which the
sea poured in torrents, was smashed in
the bow of the steamship. The shock
of the impact awakened every one on
board and huge breakers swept the
vessel fore and aft. Life boats im
mediately were ordered over the side
and all hands left the ship.
It is believed that the steamship
foundered quickly and small hope is
entertained by the survivors of th>?
wreck that the captain and other oc
cupantF of the missing life boat could
have successfully withstood the ex
treme rigor of the weather prevailing
on this coast for the many hours which
have passed.
Tugs were dispatched from this har
bor to-nigh I to search for the boa?;
and to locate the hull of the Damara.
The Damara left Liverpool on Jan
uary 24 for Halifax, by way of St.
Johns, N. F., and left St. Johns for
thit- port last Saturday. The names
of the survivors could not be learned
to-night, but it is known that all of
the crew were shipped in England.
The Damara was a schooner- rigged
steamship of 1146 tons net. She was
owned by C. Furness, Withy & Co. of
Glasgow and was built in 1885 by A.
Stephens & Sons at Glasgow. Her
principal dimensions were: Length, 275
feet; breadth, S5 feet, and depth, 23
feet.
FRUIT BOAT FAST ASHORE.
Passengers Removed From the Steam
ship Admiral Sampson.
PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 7. â The
United Fruit Company's steamship
Admiral Sampson from Port Antonio
for Philadelphia, which was carried
I ashore by the ice yesterday on the
lower end of Pea Patch Island, is
still hard aground. Her passengers,
eighteen in number, were taken off
to-day. The Admiral Sampson lies
almost high and dry at low water.
Thirty thousand bunches of bananas
were thrown overboard to-day in an
effort to lighten the vessel, but all ef
forts to float her were futile.
In endeavoring to aid the tugs in
pulling her off the Admiral Sampson's
steering gear became disabled and she
I is practically helpless.
For more than fifteen hours to-day
â  the entrance to the harbor of this city
i was blocked by the huge ice pack
< which on the ebb tide swept down the
: Delaware River until it reached the
I Horse Shoe at Gloucester, where it
I lodged and extended from shore to

bc>3ts several heavy liners succeeded
ir forcing a passage through the Ice

Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER. Colo., Feb. 7.â Captain
James L. Smith, a "gun fighter" who
has spent sixty-seven years on the
plains and can pick off pennies at fifty
yards even now with his well-notched
six-shooter, says that "Bat" Master
son, who has been appointed a Deputy
United States Marshal for the South
ern District of New York, is a four
flusher. Here are some things Captain
Smith says:
"I want to go on record as saying
that Masterson is a four-flusher and
romancer. He makes his living, by re
lating yarns which have no foundation
in fact. He likes to leave the impres
sion that he has killed a score of men.
I know of only one man who fell a vic
tim to his shooting ability, and 'Bat*
potted him from behind a woodpile. I
told him to leave Denver because he
was circulating false stories about me
and he went. I did not intend to
shoot himâ only kick him out of town.
'Bat* is such an opera bouffe hero that
I can't refrain from exposing him.
Why, he doesn't even know how to
handle a revolver. Whenever he ma
nipulates firearms he is a positive
menace to the innocent bystanders.
"When "Bat" was in Tombstone, Ariz.,
the boys had much fun with him."
Captain Smith continued. "It was a
pretty wild town and 'Bat' was indis
creet enough to tell a few stories about
what he had done In Dodge City. The
boys decided to try him out and one
night they made him jump out of the
window of a gambling-house. H^
didn't come back for revenge, either."
Local sports tell of an encounter be
tween "Bat" Masterson and "Reddy"
Gallagher, athletic instructor of the
Denver Athletic <'lub. "Reddy" is not
strong with a "gun." but he can .han
dle his fists, and he undertook to punch
"Bat's" head off. The latter is said to
have wept before the irate pugilist
could be appeased.
It is claimed to be a fact that Mas
terson left Denver after spending an
entire day dodging Smith. Captain
Smith is engaged in running down cat
tle thieves for big cattle companies.

AUBURN*. Feb. 7.â The testimony in
tthe case of Adolph Weber, accused "f
the murder of his mother. Mary \V
was very strong to-day for the aj
cution. Miss May Clark was the star
witness. Her testimony flatly con
tradicted the testimony given by
Adolph Weber before the Coroner's
jury at the inquest on his mother's re
mains. At that time Weber stated that
he had left his home about 6 o'clock
and had gone In a roundabout way
over the hill in front of the college,
down College street to the court house,
and from that point to the town proper.
Miss Clark In her testimony to-day
stated positively that he had p
her house going down town sh
after 6:30 o'clock, going toward the
town on the direct road from his
home. An attempt was made to stiH.^
her testimony by the defense, but Mint
Clark only grew more emphatic.
The first witness called this morning
was Dr. R. F. Rooney, who told of
his examination of the bodies of thÂ«
murdered Webers on the night of the
tragedy. During the course of his Â«*
animation Dr. Rooney said:
"Late on the evening of the tragedy
I was called to the home, of Adrian
Wills to dress the wounds upon thÂ«
hand of Adolph Weber. The cuts on
his hand were not made by glass but
had evidently been inflicted by some
sharp instrument. While I waa dress
ing his hand Adolph. said to me, I
wanted to stay at the flrÂ», but Frank
Dependener carried me away. I want
to go there now. When I start out to
do a thing, doctor", I generally do it.
I want to find out about nay mother.
I know my mother is dead. I know
they are all dead."
"The wound on Weber's hand wai
jagged in appearance. "
SHOWS BILLET'S COI'RSE.
Dr. Rooney then went on to
a practical example how Julius Weber
was shot. He asked Attorney Hamil
ton to step to the witness chair and by
using the attorney as a mode! pointed
our thp ttWM "f the bullet which end
ed the life <>f Julias Weber. The bullet

straight downward course.
Dr. T. M. Todd was the next witness.
He substantiated in every detail the
testimony of Dr. Rooney. Dr. Todd
was sharply cross-examined by Attor
ney Johnson. Dr. Todd admitted that
though he had been a practicing physi
cian for more than f>rty years, on the
night he examined the body of Mary
er he found but one bullet hole.
Johnson also drew from Tbdd the fact
that the second bullet hole was not

WASHINGTON, Feb. 7. â President
Roosevelt, who would welcome the
end of the Russo-Japanese war, now
h;is reason to believe that Japan,
'.vhile not willing to sue. for peace,
v ould accept peace on terms which
appear to be more reasonable than
woul . be expected from a Government
flashed with victory.
That this belief -.-vails in the iiigh

founded upon something tangible It
would be quickly dispelled at any one
of the numerous conferences between
the Secretary of State aaid Takahira.
the Japanese Minister to the United
Ftates. . It is believed here that Japan
would come to peace with Russia on
practically the terms proposed by the
Tokio Government Just before diplo
matic relations between the two gov
ernments were bioken off. These pro
posals were:
"Recognition by Japan of Manchu
ria and its littoral as being outside
lit sphere of influence, and an en
gagiem^nt on the part of Russia to
respect the territorial integrity of
China in Manchuria. Russia within
the limits of Manchuria will not im

quired by them under existing treaties
Â»ith China.
â¢Recognition by Russia of Korea

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Feh. 7.â Fred Her
man, a prisoner en route from Alameda
County to serve six years at Folsoin
prison for burglary, escaped at th
depot in this city this afternoon and at
a late hour to-night had not been re
captured.
Herman was in charge of Deputy
Sheriff Simon. He was allowed to en
ter a toilet without shackles. As he
tame out he walked over to a water
tank to get a drink. Suddenly turning,
he darted out of the waiting-room and
through the crowded depot. The dep
uty Sheriff called to him to stop, but
did not shoot for fear of hurting in
nocent parties. Herman dashed
through the gate leading to the South
ern Pacific shops and was soon lost
to view.
The police department and Sheriff's
deputies were notified and a party
formed, which ever since has been
scouring the country for him. It is
believed Herman jumped on an out
going train.
Simon is criticized by the Sacramento
officers for allowing his prisoner to go
about without irons.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 8. liXTi
RAILROADS FIND
TWO DEFENDERS
McCal! of .Massachusetts and
Sibley of Pennsylvania
Oppose the Rate Bill
PRAISE FOX MR. BRYAN
Democrats Declare President
Roosevelt Is Following
the Xebraskan's Lead
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7.â The feature
; of the debate in the House to-day on
the freight rate bill was the speech
of McCall, who declared that .it was
not to be imagined that' the Supreme
Court would stand between the Gov
ernment and its -victim, following up
that utterance with the statement that
the courts usually reflected the policy
of the party in power. The views of
the speakers as to legislation needed
! were many and varied, but with the
; exception of McCall and Sibley of
: Pennsylvania, all were agreed that the
time had arr.iyed.f-Qr .the, granting of
relief. The names of \V. J. Bryan and
i President Roosevelt figured promi
nently in the discussion, the allegation
being made from the Democratic side
of the chamber that the President's
: recent message to Congress on the sub
! ject of rate legislation only reiterated .
the views of Bryan and the declara
tions of the Democratic party in three
national platforms.
Shackieford of Missouri referred to
the recent remark of Williams of Miss
issippi, the minority leader, that the
Democrats would "toe the mark" with
the President on this question. It was
not. he said with some emphasis, .a
question of marching shoulder to
! shoulder with the President, so long as
he was toe-marking the declarations
, of the last three Democratic platforms.
, It was a question with the Democrats
,of President Roosevelt marching
j "shoulder to shoulder" with the great |
; Nebraskan, who has taken the lead in i
i this great question.
The first voice raised against the
j legislation was that of McCall of i
; Massachusetts, who maintained that it I
i was incompatible with the funda- i
1 mental principles of private property.
' The granting of authority to the'
' Interstate Commerce Commission to
fix rates, he said, was crossing the line
between regulation and confiscation in
a manner that outraged the most
patent principles of justice, and he in- .
quired if any one could imagine any
more ideal method for the destruction
| of private property and one more likely
tn corrupt the American people. The ;
| powers vested by the bill, he said, were
! too vast and dangerous to be wielded
by any political government and were
likely to lead to the destruction of
cities and to Government ownership
of railways. The very air. he said. ;
vibrated with the demands of an
! aroused public appetite.
Despairing that the railroads would
get the protection to which they were
entitled, McCall said that If the lid .
of this Pandora's box should be re- !
moved everything would escape from it :
but hope. He declared It would be
better to let the struggle between the
cities and the railroads go on than to
set up a little machine or a deity, such
as the enlarged commission proposed .
would be.
Further opposition to rate legislation
|at this time came from Sibley of
Pennsylvania, who called on his col
leagues to pause and ponder before
they acted.
I.amar of Florida charged that Me-
Call's views were those of the most
complete reactionaries of the Govern- I
ment against regulating the railroads.
Lamar claimed for W. J. Bryan and
th<^ Democratic party the credit for
first stirring the people to action. Had
not President Roosevelt thrown the
question of regulating freight rates
into Congress by a bombshell, he
asserted, the House would have sat for
twenty years to come without action ;
upon it.
CTLLOM FAVORS RATE BILL.
Believes the Fs<*h-Townsend Measure
Should Be Passed.
WASHINGTON, Feb/ 7.â Senator
Cullom, formerly chairman of the
Senate Committee on Interstate Com
merce, favors the passage by the Sen
ate of the Esch-Townsend bill for the
regulation of railroad rates. He so
expressed himself to-day to the Illi
nois Congressional delegation and the
members of the Illinois Manufactur
ers* Association, who- are here urging
rate legislation.
Senator Cullom said he was not
ready to declare the bill perfect, but
as the House had given the question
thorough consideration, and' as the
Senate will not have time to revise
the measure, it should be given to the
country for trial.
PLAN FOR FISH HATCHERIES.
Canadian Government Is Asked to
Share the Expense.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 7.â Senator
Perkins has for some time been Im
portuned by business men of Califor
nia interested in the cod fisheries of
the North Pacific Coast to have the
Government establish hatcheries at
proper points. Senator Perkins has
taken no action hitherto for the rea
son that American fishermen would
secure only partial benefit, the Cana
dian fishermen being nearer the fish
eries and free to avail themselves of
the results of American effort and ex
penditure. It is estimated that to es
tablish a hatchery would cofÂ»t $30,000.
The Senator, however, has con
ferred with Commissioner of Fisheries
Bowers and correspondence has been
opened with the Canadian authorities
with a view of having them co-oper
ate financially and otherwise. It is
believed this result can be brought
about and the hatcheries established.
COMERFORD TO FIGHT
FOR LEGISLATIVE LIFE
Believes the Committee of the Illinois
Legislature Will Report
Against Him.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Feb. 7. â
Nearly every seat in the lower house
of the State Legislature was occupied
to-3ay in anticipation of a report by
the committee investigating Repre
sentative F. E. Comerford's charges
of corruption among fellow members.
The committee, however, was given
until to-morrow to prepare a report.
Comerford stated to-day that he fully
expected the committee to report
against him. He added that he is
preparing to make on the floor of the
House a vigorous fight for his legisla
tive life. Whether the committee will
recommend expulsion, however, seema
to be an open question. â¢

OKALHOMA NOT BY ITSKLF,
Pettus and Crane and Tillman and
Hnwley were paired on this vote, and
Aldrich, Burton, Knox and Mitchell
were absent.
The result evidently was a surprise
to the advocates of the House bill
and its announcement was followed
by many conterences among them on
the floor of the Senate. While these
were in progress, McCumbor proposed,
as a substitute for the provision ad
mitting a State composed of Oklahoma
and Indian Territory combined, an
â amendment admitting Oklahoma alone
as a f^tate.
McCumber reported the substitute
and, Beveridge made an earnest plea
against it, saying it strikes at the en
tire measure and deprives the people
of Indian Territory of the relief they
so much need. Bailey and Bate
spoke for the amendment. It was de
feated. 46 to 3".
Gallinger offered an amendment
Ifiat it require a majority of both Ok
lahoma and Indian Territory to adopt
a constitution for the proposed State
of Oklahoma. A motion by Hale to
lay the amendment on the table was
carried.
LOCATION OF COURTS.
An amendment was offered by Dolli
ver, providing for terms of court at
Tulsa, In addition to the other cities in
Oklahoma provided by the bill. Bailey
opposed the amendment on the ground
that the Senators and Representatives
of the new State should be permitted
to ask Congress to locate the courts.
He said, however, that if a session of
the court is to be held at Tulsa he had
friends he wanted to accommodate at
Chlckasaw, and he offered an amend
ment providing for this. Both amend
ments were agreed to. A number of
the other amendments offered by Dem
ocratic Senators were laid on the table.
Berry suggested an amendment pro
viding that nothing in the act admit
ting" Oklahoma should be construed as
prohibiting the establishment of sepa
rate white and colored schools.
Reveridge responded that the pro
vision had been offered early in the
session and had been â¢ printed. The
ayes and noes were ordered and the
amendment was accepted 38 to 33.

with her blood, were handed to him for
identification. Every eye in the crowd
ed courtroom was strained to the ut
most limit to see what effect the sight
of the blood-stained clothing would
"have on the defendant. If the specta
tors expected any sign of emotion they
were greatly disappointed. He looked
calmly and coldly at the garments once
worn by his mother without the slight
est change of countenance.
Mrs. Li. Muston, manager of the
Apollo apartments, 526 Eddy street.
San Francisco, where the Webers re
sided last summer, testified to the
wearing apparel worn by the defend
ant. She was not allowed to give any
testimony at length for the reason that
Attorney Johnson said the testimony
was too remote. She, however, stated
that the defendant wore a light slouch
hat, a black sweater and a long over
coat.
When pressed by Attorney Johnson
to give a reason for her remembrance of
"Weber's apparel, she replied she could
not forget the appearance of any man
of such a "disreputable personality."
MAY C LARK'S STORY.
Miss May Clark was the strong wit
ness of the day. She stated that on
the night of the tragedy she was re
siding at a place called "The Cottage"
on Brewery lane. At 6:30 o'clock she
said she was gathering kindling wood
in front of the house. A bright elec
tric light was shining over th? side
walk in front of the place. She heard
a noise, she said, and looking up saw
Adolph -Weber.
"I am well acquainted with him,"
continued the witness. "For several
months he had passed the house two
cr three times every day. He usual
ly walked slowly, but on this occasion
he was walking fast. He had barely
passed the house on his way down
town whenfj heard the whistle of the
local railroad train. This was about
6:30 o'clock. I then went into the
house, changed my skirt, and started
down to the postoffice to get the even-
Ing mail. When I got there, I saw
Adolph standing in front of the door.
I said to him, "Hello Kid." and went
into the postoffice. I don't remember
v hat he replied to the salutation."
At this point the Clark woman was
cross-examined by Attorney Johnson.
He attempted to shake her evidence in
every way, but she adhered firmly to
the story she had told.
Johnson read a statement to her,
made by Lottie Smith and Myrtle Hall,
inmates of a place called the "Palace,"
opposite the "Cottage." The state
ment was to the effect that on the
night of the tragedy Miss Clark had
visited them and had stated that she
was a great friend of the Weber fa
mily; that she and Bertha Weber were
chums, or words to that effect, and
that she had frequently been to the
Weber home.
Miss Clark could hardly contain
herself during the reading of the state
ment. She almost jumped out of the
â witness chair and shouted:
"No, sir, no, sir, that is not true, I
never said anything of that sort to
those women, so help me God."
POWELL, SAW WEBER.
J. A. Powell of Bullion was another
strong witness for the prosecution. He
stated that on the night of the tragedy
I he was in the wash-room of the Ameri
â  can Hotel. He was standing in a re
mote corner at the lavatory when he
; heard some one enter from the back
! street. He turned round and saw
â Adolph Weber washing his hands. At
that moment "Weber saw him. With
out turning off the water or stopping
to dry his hanÂ£- on the towel, said

Bacon then offered an amendment
eliminating Arizona and New Mexico
entirely from the bill. The amendment
was adopted. 38 to 36.
AMEXDMEXT PREVAILS.
Bard then in slightly different form
renewed his motion to admit New
Mexico as a separate State and the
motion prevailed, 40 to 37, as follows:

Foraker moved to lay on the table
the motion to reconsider and that mo
tion prevatled, 39 to 38. the only change
from the previous vote being that of
Beveridge, who voted %i the negative.
This was the last roll call. The bill as
amended then was passed without di
vision and on motion of Foraker the
Senate at 8:06 o'clock adjourned.
PIiEASED AT RESIXT.
Demonst rations Take Place in Okla-
homa and Indian Territory.
OKLAHOMA CITY, O. T., Feb. 7. â
The announcement that the Senate
has passed the statehood bill provid
ing for 'the joint admission of Okla
homa and Indian Territory is creating
great enthusiasm in both Territories.
The Gallinger prohibition amendment
is arousing a great deal of interest and
considerable opposition is expected to
develop against that feature, but there
appears no doubt that the enabling
act will be accepted even if this pro
vision is not stricken out In confer
ence. Public demonstrations took
place all over both Territories to
night.
Powell, Weber dashed out of the place '
into the main hallway of the hotel. 'â 
The witness stated that he went into
the hotel proper and looked at the
dock. It was either 6:40 or 6:43 p. m. j
"Weber's actions at that time," volun
teered the witness, "made an impres
sion upon my mind, and I remarked to
myself. That fellow must be crazy.' "
Powell said he saw Weber again later
on the same evening in the hotel. He
was scuffling with some young friends
and demanding to "see the girls."
Attorney Johnson rigidly cross-ex- i
I amined Powell, but could in no way
shake his testimony. "How did you get
into this case?" aaked Johnson. "I !
suppose by butting in, same as the
others did," was the answer. "Did you
see any man at that time in the
American Hotel as you state?" asked
Johnson. 'I saw that man at that
time." replied Powell, pointing at
Weber.
Mm Inez McÃrayer, who lived at
the "Cottage" at the time of the
tiagedy, testified she saw some man
pass the houpc about 6:30 hut she could
not say it was Adolph Weber.
Other witnesses to-day were W. F.
Crosby. J. K. Corea and Joseph Golden
l)t rg.
The court room was crowded
throughout the entire session. More
] than half the spectators were promi- â¢
nent women of Auburn. Among then:
were a number of the school girl I
friends of Bertha Weber.
Mrs. Snowden and Mrs. Hess, the â 
I sisters o? the murdered woman, were
present during the afternoon session.
Attorney General U. S. Webb, who is
conducting the prosecution of Weber,
warn greatly pleased with to-day's pro
ceedings. The evidence adduced he re
gardf a? most damaging against the
! defendant.

to Congress:
i i the Senate and House of Representatives:
Circumstar.i tS have placed under the control
oi ih;s Government the Philippine Archipelago.
111-- wlanls of that group present as many in-
U resting and novel tmestiuns with respoot to
their geology and mint-ral resources as any
region of the world. At my request the Na
tional Academy of Sciences appointed a com
mute" to consider and report upon the dÂ«
sirability of Instituting scientific explorations
of the Philippine Islands. The report of this
i-< mmittee, togpther with thÂ« report of the
bdjrd ot scientific rorveyi of the Philippine
liiar.ds, including the draft of a bill providing
for surveys or th*> Philippine Islands, which,
board was appointed by me. after receiving thÂ«
report of the committee appointed by the
-National Academy of Sciences, with Instruc
tions to prepare such estimates and m-ike
such ?u#KeÂ«>t:ons aÂ» might appear to it per
tinent in the circumstances, accompanies the
mesnage.
The scientific surveys which should be taken
go fur beyond any surveys or exp!f>rations
which the Government of 'the Philippine lal
ai.ils, ho*ever I'lirnpletely srlf-supr'Tting,
could be exuected to make. These surveys,
while, of course, beneflVlal to the people .if
the Philippine Islands-, should be undertaken
as a nationaJ work for the information not
merely of the people of the Philippine Islands,
but of the people of this country ami of the
world. Only preliminary explorations hava
yet been mad* in the archipelago, and It
shoold be a matter of pride to the Govern
ment of the l"nited States fully to investigate
and to describe the entire region. So far as
may be convenient and practical the work of
this survey sh.Kild be conducted in harmony
with that of the proper bureaus of the Gov
ernment of -the Philippines, but It should not
be under the control of the authorities In the
Philippines, for it should be undertaken as a
national work and subject to a board to bÂ«
appointed by Congress or the President.
The plan transmitted recommends simul
taneous surveys In different branches o< re
search, organized on a co-operative basla.
This would tend to i-ompleteness, avoid dupli
cation and render the work more economical
than if the exploration wens undertaken piece
meal. Xo such organized surveys have evei
yet been attempted anywhere: but the Idea is
in harmony with modern scientific and In
dustrial methods.
I recommend, therefore, that provision be
made for the appointment of a board of sur
veys to superintend the national survey and
explorations to be made In the Philippine IsU
ar.ds. and that appropriations be made front
time to time to meet the necessary expenses
of su'-h investigation. It Is nut probable that
the survey would be completed in a leas
period than that of eight or ten years, but
It Is well that It should be begun In the near
future. The Philippine Commission and those
rtsponsible for the Philippine Government art
properly anxious that this survey should n.>t
be considered as an expense of that Govern
ment, but should be carried on and treated as
a national duty in the interest of science.

NOW GOVERNOR GENERAL.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 7. â Luke EJ.
Wright of Tennessee is the first Amer
ican citizen to bear the title "Governor
General" in the Philippine Islands,
the Philippine bill signed by the
President yesterday authorizing the
change from the title he now holds,
namely, Civil Governor of the Phil
ipines. Secretary Taft to-day sent
the following cablegram to the new
Governor General:
I salute and congratulate the first American
(iuvernor General of the Philippine Islands,
and wish for him rhe same sucease which has
attended his administration as civil governor.
ARIZONA WELL SATISFIED.
PHOENIX, A. T., Feb. 7.â The ac
tion of the Senate with respect to
Statehood was not definitely learned
here until late this evening, when the
news spread quickly. Satisfaction is
expressed by all thus far, though there
was no public demonstration. Arizona
rejoices with New Mexico In her good
fortune and thinks she should be
similarly treated, but present satis
faction at not being tacked on to New
Mexico is so universal that the privi
lege of remaining a Territory is second
only to securing a single Statehood.
The opinion is generally expressed
that Arizona's chances for admission
have been greatly improved by the
favorable action as to New Mexico
and that this Territory will be admit
ted by the Fifty-ninth Congress.

The Rev. James Rowell of the Mari

Independent Want for
Armor Plate for Warships

Believed That the Capacity
of the New Company Does
Not Warrant Consideration
WASHINGTON. Feb. 7.â The board
of officers appointed by Secretary Mor
ton to investigate the capacity of the
several armorplate companies has
recommended that the bid for 8000
tons of armor for the battleship New
Hampshire and the armored cruiser*
North Carolina and Montana, of the
Midvale Steel Company, be rejected.

In announcing the award, it is stated
that while the Midvale Steel Company

BECOMES ALMOST A FARCE BECAUSE OF THE EFFORTS OF THE
DEFENDANTS TO IMPEACH THE CHARACTERS OF THE DETECTIVES
WITNESSES WHO BELITTLE SLEUTHS
ARE SHOWN TO BE PREJUDICED.
Gould and Cator Indulge in a Wordy War
Attorneys Wax Angry During Investigation and Chairman
Belshaw Is Compelled to Demand a Cessation of Hostilities.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 7.â The effort
of the attorneys representing Senators
BmtnotiE, Bunkers, French and Wright
to discredit the testimony of Detectives
Ticheror and Hartling is becoming
farcies'.. They produced another batch
of â¢witnesses to-night in an effort to
prove that the detectives named are
not worthy of belief, but in each in
stance the witnesses were proved to be
biased through connection with either
the section 26 shooting affray or the
swamp lands case, both Bakersfleld
productions, or through hearing the
same discussed.
The belligerency of opposing counsel
ie becoming more marked with each
session and to-night the lit OaRK so
n^ar bring passed that for a moment
there was grave danger of a < lash be
tween Frank H. Gould for the |
cution and Thomas V. Cator for the
defense. Gould drove his questions on
crose- examination with a rapidity that
ofttimee called for a protest from
Cator, who demanded that the wit
nesses be given all the time th<*y re
quired to answer questions. Gould ad
mitted that he was often in a hurry to
gret in another question. l>ui said it was
the preoccupation that overcame him
ID the heat of battle that was respon
sible for his haste.
Things were going along well after
this until Cator suddenly conceived the
Idea that Gould had again cut off an
answer a witness was about to make
and said: . .
â¢"Let the witness answer the ques
tion right through."
"I thought the witness was through."

"Don't you dare to accuse me again."
said Gould jumpin; tn his fe> t. <"au>r

warned the attorneys to cease
their quarrel.
"I had not spoken," said Gould,
"when Cator made a remark that I
<Â«uld not permit to go unchallenged."
Cator made no reply, but throughout
the session each watched for the op
portunity to hurl home a verbal shaft.
Joseph S. Jordan was not called to
the stand to-night, it being the desire
of the committee to permit the defense
to put on its remaining character wit
nesses. It was announced, however,
that Jordan would go on without fail
to-morrow night at S o'clock. Jordan
will have an interesting story to tell.
After this announcement the character
witness on behalf of the defense were
called. jt

"What do you know of Tichenor?
To your knowledge did he return true
and correct reports of the shooting

"Yes. he did return true reports to
his employers."
"Then why do you say you would
not believe him under oath?" -
"I wouldn't believe any detective
under oath. I think the ethical cen
ters of their minds are peculiar."
But the report he made of the
shooting affair was absolutely cor

"Yes, it was correct."
These answers on the part of the
witness are strongly in favor of the
case of the prosecution as they go to
estsMfsti that Tichenor is reliable In
his prof esslonal â¢ work and this is all
the prosecution wishes to establish.
In conclusion the witness was forced
to mit that he had known Senator

J. W. Briscoe, an oil man of Bakers

him asainst the detective. The wit
admitted that he was arrested
twice for the offense, hut was dismissed
through lack of evidence. Bousto
created a iaugh by saying he
did not believe Tichenor was
â  detective. but a hawkshaw.
He further admitted that he had
trouble with th<= Continental Building
and Loan Association, having borrow
ed $1800 from the Continental on a
piece of property -worth, he admitted,
only $600 and that he only paid up to
avoid the trnui'le of a lawsuit. Bousto
was rambling^ahead. going into the ins
and outs of the entire affair, when
Could suddenly interrupted him and
said :
'"< >h. you're the man that Sam Dun
lap whipped for getting full and giving
the whole section 26 affair away?"
"No sir." protested the witness. "I
licked Dunlap myself. I was not drunk
that nicht. When I get drunk I ain't
afraid to so. I get drunk and buy
wine myself."
As th<- committee was not anxious
to hear the entire story of Bnusto's wild
times in life, his further services as
character witness for the defense were
dispensed with.
II W MORE WITNESSES.
Th" names of W. A. McKenzie and
Mathew Smith were called by Cator
after the funny man from Fresno had
left the stand, but neither answered.
The attorney was asked what other
witnesses he had.
â¢We are through as far as I know,"
he said, "excepting as to those from
Downievllle."
â¢"When do you expect them here?"
asked Chairman Belshaw.
Sergeant at Arms Martin answered
that these witnesses were due in Sac
ramento at 10 o'clock to-morrow morn
ing.
The representatives of Corbin said
they had no witnesses here that they
wished to call, excepting Superintend
ent Beede of the Postal Telegraph
Company, who has a telegram that
passed during the time it is alleged
Tichenor was putting the money into
the hands of Jordan. Beede did not
answer to his name.
"If these witnesses from Downieville
do not get here by to-morrow night I
suppose we will close the case," said
Cator.
Yju said you wanted Corbin here
to-morrow night, did you not?" asked
Belshaw.
It was Copeland who wanted to ask
him some more questions," was the
reply.
The chairman said that Corbin would
be present. He also spoke a warning
to witnesses who may not answer their
names when called, saying that it
would be the unpleasant duty of the
committee to have them called before
the bar of the Senate for contempt.
The hearing went over until 8
o'clock to-morrow night. If the de
fense finishes early with the remainder
of its character witnesses, Corbin's
side may introduce some testimony in
rebuttal.
DEFEND TORRANCE.
San Diego Lawyers Tell of Jurist's
Good Points.
SAX DIEGO, Feb. 7.â The Assembly
committee that is inquiring into the
charts against Judge E. S. Torrance
of this city concluded its labors, so far
as the taking of testimony in San
Diego is concerned, at a late hour to
night. The day was almos| entirely
occupied by the defense, only one or
two witnesses being called by the pros
ecution.
A. Hjp, Sweet, president of the San
Diego Bar Association, was called and
testified along similar lines as the wit
nesses for the defense called yester
day. He had never known of Judge
Torrance being on the bench while un
der the influence of liquor and did not
believe that Judge Torrance's judicial
abilities had been impaired.
Walter S. Buchanan testified that he
had seen Judge Torrance the morning
of January* 16, 1905. The witness stated
that he did not believe Judge Tor
rance was intoxicated. Frank A. Sal
mons and Mrs. Thresher testified the
same as the preceding witnesses.
Judge Torrance took the stand in his
own behalf. He denied that he had
drunk any liquor on July 31, the date
or. which a witness testified that the
Judge appeared to be intoxicated. He
dtnied that he had ever engaged in a
boxing bout in a saloon, but said he
recalled an occasion when in a jocular
way he attempted to knock off a
friend's hat. Judge Torrance also de
nied that he had used language derog
atory to the Christian church, although
he recalled expressing his opinion
about hypocrites in the church who
had been active against himself.
BEFORE GRAND JURY.
Sacramento Inquisitorial Body Inves
tigating Scandal.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 7.â The charge
of bribe-taking preferred against Sen
ators Emmons, Wright, Bunkers and
French of the State Legislature was
under investigation to-day by the
Grand Jury of Sacramento County.
The entire day was spent by the Jurors
in examining the witnesses who were
called by the investigating committee
of the Senate to substantiate the
charges preferred in the affidavit filed
by William Corbfa.

he raised the money that is said to
have been passed to the Senators
through Joseph S. Jordan, was closely
questioned. Attorney Gavin McNab
has been called to tell what he knows
ot the allegations of bribery and this
afternoon Henry Hartling and George
Tiehenor, the detectives who swore
they laid the trap for Jordan and the
Senators, were called to reiterate their
story to the effect that they saw the
money given by Jordan to Senators
Emmons and Bunkers.
The greatest secrecy is being main
tained regarding the investigation into
the bribery scandal, and It has not
been learned who has been subpoenaed
on behalf of the deft-rise. It is ex
pected, however, that thr accused
Senators will be called before the
Grand Jury before the investigations
are concluded.

WOLFE SCENTS FIGHT.
Senator Aroused by Opposition to
< ivil Service Amendment.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 7. â In the ac
tion of the San Francisco delegation
reporting against Wolfe's proposed
constitutional amendment guarantee
ing the right of trial to every civil
service employe of San Francisco
whom It is sought to remove from of
fice, the author of the bill sees oppo
sition to civil service per se.
"This is simply a plain, open move
against civil service," said Wolfe this
morning, "but it will avail the oppo
nents little. I am confident the pro
posed amendment will pass the Legis
lature and be ratified by the people.
It is a well known fact that many peo
ple that want free rein in the patron
ag-e question are opposed to civil ser
vice per se and among these are the
San Francisco Senators that voted in
committee against the measure.
"It is a well known fact that in twer
cases the Supreme Court has plainly
held that the section of the charter
guaranteeing the right of trial to
municipal employes is contrary to the
constitution as it now stands and that
my amendment is essential if the in
stitution of civil service is to be safe
guarded. It must be safeguarded or
it will fall, and I am sure a majority
of the Legislature will share my
views."
del:ds and mortgages.
Laws Governing Redemption of Prop.
erty Subject of Legislation.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 7. â The pres
ent Legislature probably will make
two radical changes in the law cov
ering trust deeds and mortgages. A
bill has been introduced by Espey of
Alameda providing for the redemp
tion of property given under a trust
deed, the same as mortg-aged property
is redeemed. At present there is no
redemption of property conveyed un
der a trust deed.
A bill is to be introduced reducing
the time of redemption of property
sold under mortgage from one year to
six months. It is claimed that at pres
ent the property is held during the
period of redemption at the risk of
the mortgagee, as the mortgagor will
redeem if the property rises in value
and then the mortgagee will lose if it
depreciates. Another objection to the
year limit is that in many cases it pre
vents the mortgagor making in time
improvements that may mean much
for the future of the property.
POOL SELLING BILL.
New Measure Is Introduced by As
semblyman Duryea.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 7. â Within a
few days the Assembly will be con
sidering a bill prohibiting the selling
of pools on horse races and it will not
be the one the Committee on Public
Morals of that house had referred to
it. Duryea of Placer, chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, introduced such
a bill to-day and it was promptly re
ferred to his committee, it being the
intention, it is said, to report it back
immediately with a recommendation
that it pass.
Duryea's bill fixes the penalty for
the violation of its provisions at a fine
of not less than $2000 nor more than
$5000 or imprisonment for not less
than one year nor more than five
years. The period from September 1
to September 30 is left open so that
the State and district fairs may not be
affected.
NEW CLERKS NAMED.
Chief Clerk Lloyd Obtains Services of
Two Expert Engrossers.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 7.â The Re
publican members of the Assembly
held a caucus this afternoon to hear
some suggestions from Chief Clerk
Lloyd on how to facilitate legislation.
There has been some trouble in re
gard to the engrossment of bills. Two
serious errors have been made, bills
being sent back as correctly engrossed
without the amendments being in
cluded.
At the afternoon session of the As
sembly Chief Clerk Lloyd was author
ized to employ two expert clerks. He
will send for C. S. McMullen of Oak
land and L. F. Stinson of Grass Val
ley, two experienced desk and en
grossing men.

DECLARE GATES
IS A BUSYBODY
Scalp of Secretary Is Sought
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 7.â W. Almont
Gates, secretary of the State Board of
Charities and Corrections, has destroy
ed his usefulness as a public servant
in the opinion of the Senate committee
appointed to investigate various insti
tutions of the State. This committee â
composed of Woodward, chairman;
Muenter. Haskins, Sanford. Coggins
and McKee â recommends that Gates
be dismissed from office forthwith. It
was the intention of the committee to
recommend to the Senate that if the
Board of Charities refuses to consent
to his dismissal the Senate here
after deny any appropriation for the i
payment of his salary, but this recom
mendation was stricken from the re
port after the opinion was reached
that the board would doubtless
acquiesce in the views of the committee
and that an implied threat in the re
port was unnecessary. Regarding
Gates the committee says:
While possibly it may not be within the
province of the committee, the committee can
not refrain from '-ommeining on the executive
officer and secretary of the State Board of
Charitleg.
From information that has come to this com
mittee we conclude that the members of the
State Board of CharitWs are all most estimable
gentleman having at heart the welfare and
upbuilding: of the State institutions under their
supervision. If any criticism can be made
It Is that they have placed too much authority
In the hands of their secretary, who. In the
Judgment of this committee, misconceives his
duties. He has apparently assumed the role
of a Hawkshaw or Plnkerton detective and
Â«e-ems to teel that it is his duty to ferret out
all little errors of judgment or delinquencies
of the management of the various institutions
to which he has access and hold the manage
ment of these Institutions up to public criti
cism and condemnation not deserved, Instead
of kindly pointing out th'Â»se errors and show-
Ing the managers how they can be Improved
upon and corrected. HiÃ methods have been

COMMITTEE'S REPORT.
This committee, which left Sacra
mento on its tour of inspection on
January 26, returning on the Ist inst.,
visited the State School at Whittier,
the nrnal School at Los Angeles, the
State Hospital at Patton, the Normal
School and Quarantine Station at San
Diego, the Polytechnic School at San
Luis Obispo, the State Hospital at
Agnews and the Normal School at San
Jose. Regarding these institutions the
committee reported in part as follow*:
Your committee visited the formal School
at Ivos Angeles. Cal., and made a careful In
spection of the building and ground?. We
found the building in a had condition and
hardly suitable for the purposes Intended. As
a business proposition it would not pay the
Stat* to go to the expense of putting the
building in proper condition. The present, site
is near the center of town and could be sold
for a sufficient sum to build a modern up-to
ilate building. We would therefore recommend
that a new site be secured and that the pres
ent one be sold and the money from the sale
of the same bo used in erecting a new build-
Ing upon a different site. As It would take
some time to erect a new building, a small
amount of money should be appropriated to
repair the roof and floor to make said old
building tenantable until the new structure Is
ready for occupancy.
The Inspection of the Whittier School was a
1 pleasant and agreeable surprise. We found
the grounds and buildings in good order the
discipline all that could" be wished for and a
most kindly feeling existing between the in
mates and the superintendent, who exercises
a wholesome and Â«6oral supervision over both
girls and boys. The recommendation of the
superintendent that the sum of $000 be ap
propriated to furnish the girls' cottage, known
as Cottage "B," is. In the judgment of thÂ»
committee, of the greatest necessity. The
committee also recommends an appropriation
of $8000 for additional and correction of the
present plumbing in the main buildings; also
the sum of $8000 for the construction o? a
reservoir to store the water now available
% from the pumping plant.
We found the San Diego Normal School one
of the best arranged school buildings In the
State and suitable in every way for the work
Intended. The grounds should be fenced and
Improved; an appropriation of $5000 being
ample to begin with. The sewerage Is bad
and sufficient money should be appropriated
to properly connect the building with the city
sewer system.
Your committee arrived at the Southern
State Hoopital. located near Patton station,
in San Bernardino County, on Sunday, Janu
ary 29, 1906. at 4 p. m., and at this time de
sires to express its gratification and to com
mend the work of this particular Institution
and to especially comment upon the business
like ability of Its superintendent as demon
strated by him to this committee.
ENLARGE ASYLUMS.
The asylum at the time of our visit con
tained a total of 599 patients, or this num
ber 577 were males and 322 females. Your
committee found a large number of patients
sleeping in the corridors and hallways, and
that there are enough of these unfortunates to
fill a new ward building as soon as completed.
The completion of one additional wing would
therefore leave the hospital in a much better
condition and add much to the comfort of Its
Inmates. Therefore your committee recom
mends that Senate bill 4W. Introduced by Sen
ator Leeke, providing for the building, equip
ping and furnishing of a wing to said institu
tion, making an appropriation of $65,000 there
for, do pass, and be approved by his excel
lency the Hon. George C Pardee. the Gov
ernor of the State of Califs, via.
The San Luis Obispo Polytechnic School was
opened to pupils last July and as the State
Is thus committed to this policy the only thing
to do is to erect the other buildings necessary
to carry on this line of work properly.
The buildings and grounds of the San Jose
Normal School are In good condition. The
building Is crowded for room and It would
seem economy in the long run to erect a
library building and gymnasium, the base
ment to be used for a gymnasium and the
upper part for library purposes.

inspection of this institution commends the
work of the management of this institution
and especially commends the expenditure
of money from the contingent fund for the
erection of cottages, and further commend*
to similar Institutions in this State to follorv
this Institution in the erection of cottages such
as the one now just completed at this insti
tution.
The asylum at the time of our visit con
tained 1070 patients, and we found that by
the erection of cottages as hereinbefore men
tioned, thÂ«?e patients are all well cared for.
After recommending that the va
rious institutions be allowed the full
sums of their estimates for the main
tenance of the same the committee, in
conclusion, says:
Your committee desires to call attention to
the fact that the practice by the Senate of
sending upon tours oÂ£ investigation coramii
tees consisting of two or three members from
each of the several committees, who. will late.
have the various subjects affected In charge,
appears to us to be most desirable, both as a
measure of economy to the State as well as
when viewed in the light of the results general
ly desired to be accomplished. It appears to us
eminently proper that the members of thiÂ«
Senate, especially the particular committees
having In charge the matters treated in th'a
report, should be able to judge of the neces
titles of the various Institutions of the SU.e
desiring aid, financial or otherwise, at thÂ«j
hands of this Senate, and It appears to us
that this Information can only be obtained at
first hand through the means of personal ob
servation.
WOUI/D ABOLISH BOARD.
Assemblyman Atkinson introduced
a resolution in the lower house to
day providing for the framing by the
Committee on Commissions and Pub
lic ExDenditures of a bill abolishing
the State Board of Charities and Cor
rections.
The resolution brought to light the
fact that there has been some un
pleasant feeling engendered between
the board referred to and the As
semblymen who have visited the in
stitutions under its control. In his
resolution Atkinson quotes an article
from a Los Angeles paper which tells
of the Assembly Committee on State
Charities and Corrections going
"down to Whittier" from Los Angeles
to inspect the State institution there,
it being the third Assembly committee
to make the trip, and adding:
"It is said outside the charmed cir
cle that the legislators are assuming:
the powers of meddling in the ap
pointment of a new superintendent for
Whittier. This will be resented by
the board of trustees. One thing that
is apparent is that these committees
do not agree unanimously with the
State Board of Charities and Correc
tions, and it is reported that the mem
bers of the board even refused to go
into conference with a legislative com- !
â¢mlttee because the statesmen had but
a hazy idea of why they had come
to the southland, except for a good
time."
Atkinson's resolution, after quoting
this article, goes on to say that where
as the Board of Charities and Cor
rections is a creature of the Legisla
ture, trusted at the expense of the
taxpayers with the duties of enlight- j
ening said Legislature on public ser- i
vice and the various institutions un
der lbs control, and that whereas the
"insulting statements" In the article
referred to show that the board is
forgetting the consideration due t!%r
Legislature and its duty, the bill
asked for be prepared by the com
mittee designated.
A motion by Houser of Los Angeles
to lay the resolution on the table was
defeated and it was referred to the
committee suggested.

IRISH NOW
KNOWS WHAT
A "CINCH" IS
Senator's Misuse oi
Word Is Cause of
an Uproar.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 7.â Lack of;
understanding of the meaning of the !
term "cinch" bill on the part of Sen- ;
ator John B. Irish precipitated a
warm debate in the upper house this
morning and ended in Senator Irish j
withdrawing a statement that reflect- |
ed seriously on Senator Howard A. j
Broughton of Pomona. Broughton's
bill authorizing the destruction of
liquors involved in a violation of State, !
county or municipal laws or regula
tions, so strongly opposed by Keane |
last week, was up for final passage.
Irish led the opposition in to-day's
fight and had not proceeded long in
I his debate when he characterized the ;
I measure as a "cinch" bill. The ire I
I of the author of the bill and its sup- j
porters was immediately raised and !
they demanded of Irish an answer as
to whether he knew what he was say- |
ing; if he knew what a "cinch" bill
was commonly supposed to be.
Hohn rose and said that it was the
common understanding that a "cinch"
bill was a measure framed for the
purpose of blackmail; one that its au- j
thor had no idea of passing, but sim- j
ply introduced it to give weight to his
demand that his silence be purchased i
with gold.
Irish listened to this definition with !
astonishment plainly written on his
face, but before he could answer ;
other Senators corroborated Hahn's I
views, and then Irish said.
"My idea of a 'cinch' bill was en- (
tirely different from the one here giv- ;
en. This word Is new to me and I i
believed a 'cinch' bill was one au- !
thorizing the destruction of property '
or favoring a certain section against I
the whole people. I had no idea what- '
ever of reflecting on Senator Brough- i
ton or any of those that support his
measure and standing corrected I j
wish to withdraw my statement."
A motion was made that the bill be |
referred to a special committee of one :
for amendment, to retain its place on
the file, but Shortridge, who is also ,
opposed to the measure, said:
"Let us take up this measure now
â Ad kill it off. It is not a bill we want
on the statute books. No delay here
is necessary. Let us take a vote and
end its career."
But Shortridge was overruled aftd
the bill was referred to committee j
for amendment in minor particulars, :
after which it will again cbme up in
regular order. â¢
Two bills by Carter, one relating to ;
how funds may be invested by insur- j
ance companies the other to the hold- |
ing, purchase and conveyance of real
estate by life insurance companies, ,
were passed and sent to the Assembly.
ThÂ« balance of the morning session
was taken up with a discussion of
Welch's bill relating to the refunding
of taxes illegally or erroneously col
lected or paid more than once. Dis- !
cussion on the bill was not concluded ;
and it went over, retaining its place
on the file.
The Senate was informed this morn
ing that the Governor had signed the i
measures appropriating $70,000 for .
the installation of an exhibit at the i
Lewis and Clark Exposition in Port- â¢
land and authorizing the Federal Gov- \
ernment to lower the levels of Kla
math. Tule. Goose and Clear lakes in
Sisklyou and Modoc counties in fur- j
therance of its reclamation and irriga- '
tion work.
A bill was introduced this afternoon ,
by Lukens increasing the salary of the
secretary of the Bank Commission ,
from $200 to $300 a month, and vesting
that official with added functions. The
bill, if passed, will authorize the secre
tary to administer oaths and examine .
into the affairs of any institution he j
may be directed to investigate, his re- j
port to be the basis of subseauent ac- '
tion by the commission.
Senator Lukens also Introduced a j
proposed constitutional amendment ;
that if passed and ratified by the peo
ple will mean the end of bucket shops
and other institutions dealing in mar
gins or lotteries of any kind.
Senator Ward Introduced a bill
amending the present compulsory vac
cination law. the only changes being i
that "good and reliable" vaccine be
procured by trustees for the vaccina
tion of children whose parents are !
peculiarly or otherwise unable to pro- |
cure vaccination for such child, and |
that children whose health would ren- j
der their vaccination a dangerous j
operation be excluded from the provi- |
sions of the act.
Leavitt's anti-compulsory vaccina
tion bill came up on reconsideration
in the Senate this afternoon and was
passed and sent to the Assembly.

Amendment Changing Method of
Electing Senators Not Liked.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 7. â San
ford's proposed constitutional amend
ment providing for the election of
United States Senator! by direct vote
of the people is doomed to defeat.
A caucus of the Republican members
called by Wolfe to consider the meas
ure discussed It at length and then
called for a vote. Nineteen members
voted against the measure. When the
absentees are gathered in it is cer
tain that the amendment win be de
feated by a majority that will leave
no hope of a different result on recon
sideration. The Republicans hold
that the present manner of election
best safeguards the office, and is a
conservative method that cannot be
improved.

are several of these bills, the whole
covering the system of reform outlined
by the committee, yet to be passed.
; A!l the remaining ones ars ready for
final passage.
Houser took advantage of the fact
i that some of the opponents of the
measure on the San Francisco sidÂ«
i were absent on committee work, and
tried again to secure the passage of
! his celebrated bill granting the rizht
i tr> graduates of the law department of
| the Southern California Methodist Uni
; verslty to be admitted to practice on
; their diplomas. No word was spoken
i against the bill, but some of the San

on the floor and it was again defeated.
Houser gave an exhibition of tenacity
' by changing his vote from aye to no
i and giving notice that he would move
fee a reconsideration.
Two school bills of Importance â¢were
pissed. One by Tritnsue provides
that high schools may be organized in
districts where there are only 150 pupils
and where the nearest existing high
school 1y six miles away. The present
limit is 300 pupils. The other bill ia

THEORIES ABOUT FOOD.
Also a few Facts on the Same Subject.
"We hear"' much nowadays about
; health foods and hygienic living, about
J vegetarianism and many other fads
i along the same line.
Restaurants may be found in the
large cities where no meat, pastry or
I coffee is served and the food crank is
lin his glory, and arguments and
! theories galore are advanced to prove
i meat was never intended for human
i stomachs, and almost make us believe
that our sturdy ancestors who lived
four score years in robust health on |
j Toast beef, pork and mutton must havet
| been grossly ignorant of the laws of
health.
Our forefathers T ad other things to
do than formulae theories about the
[ food they ate. A warm welcome was
i extended to any kind from bacon to
i acorns. â 
A healthy appetite and common sense
I are excellent guides to follow In mat-
| ters of diet, and a mixed diet of grains,
i fruits and meats Is undoubtedly tb<Â»
best.
As compared with grains and vege-
tables, meat furnishes the most nutri-
1 ment in a highly concentrated form
'and is digested and assimilated more
quickly than. vegetables and grains.
Dr. Julius Remmson on this subject
says: Nervous persons, people run
down in health and of low vitality
should eat meat and plenty of It. If
the digestion is too feeble at first it
may be easily corrected by the regular
use of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets after
each meal. Two of these excellent
tablets taken . after dinner will , digest
several thousand grains of meat, eggs
or other animal food In three hour>.
j and no matter how weak the stomach
j may be. no trouble will be experienced
â¢ If a regular practice is made of using
! Staarf s Dyspepsia Tablets, because
{they supply the pepsin and diastase
' necessary :to perfect., digestion,', and
every form of Indigestion will be over-
come by their use.
That large class of people who come
under the head of nervous dyspeptics
should eat plenty of meat and Insure
its proper digestion, by the dally use
of a safe, . harmless digestive medicine
like ; Stuart's Dyspepsia â¢ Tablets com-
; posed of the natural digestive princi-
' pies, pepsin, diastase, fruit 'acids, and
I salts, which actually perform the work
lof digestion. Cheap cathartic mcdi-
' cines, masquerading under â¢' the name
I of dyspepsia cures, are useless for In-
'â  digestion as they hayÂ« absolutely no
effect upon the actual digestion of food.
Dyspepsia in : all its many forms is
! simply a failure of the stomach to
digest food, and the sensible r .way to
solve the riddle and cure the dyspepsia
f is to make dally use at meal flme of
; a preparation like Stuarfs Dyspepsia
! Tablets.' which Is endorsed by the medi-
cal profession and known to contain
active digestive - principle*.
All druggists sell Stuarf a Dywpepsia
Tablets at 50 cents for full treatment.

SOININEN'S
MURDERER
A STUDENT
Assassin Popu
lar at Helsing
fors College. â 
HELPIXOFORS, Finland, Feb. 7.â
The assassin of Soisalon Soininen, Pro
curator General of Finland, who was
shot and killed yesterday at his resi
dence by a young man dressed in an
officer's uniform, has been identified as
Earl Lenard Hohenthal, formerly a
student at the Imperial Alexander
University here. Hohenthal, who lat
terly had lived in Stockholm, returned
to Finland on January 13. When con
scious he maintains obstinate silence
under examination. Senator Akerman,
who has assumed the duties of Pro
curator of the Senate, is directing the
investigation ot the crime. The wounds
inrlicted on the assassin by the son of
Soininen are rot of a dangerous char
acter.
The assassin was removed to-day
from the surgical hospital to the Rus
sian military hospital, where he lies
not fully conscious. It was at flr6t be
lieved that his comatose condition was
the result of a drug, but his head was
badly injured while he was being
dragged downstairs after the murder.
This latest political crime, following
the January demonstration, has caused
the police to redouble their precau
tions. The Journal BJorsnbergs Tid
ings was suspended to-day, but this
had no direct connection with the as
sassination.
Hohenthal's father was a pastor of
Laiha. The assassin left the Helsing
fors University a couple of years ago
without terminating the medical
course, and took ur> massage as a
means of livelihood. He recently re
turned here from Stockholm and went
to St. Petersburg, where, it is believed,
he formed revolutionary ties. The uni
form worn by the assassin in order to
avert suspicion was an imitation of a
Russian naval officer's.
A press correspondent met a friend
of Hohenthal, who spoke in the highest
terms of him. He was popular among
his fellow students on account of his
good nature, winning w.ays and pre
dilection for sports.
The office of Procurator General is
one of the highest In Finland. The
Procurator General is head of the De
partment of Justice of the Finnish
Senate. The Finns have the right to
petition the Procurator General in the
case of any grievance In connection
with the administration of Justice and
the Procurator General can order a
new trial.
Soininen was 48 years old. His father
was a pastor of Pedisbarvl. Young
Soininen studied law, was appointed
secretary of the Department of Econ
omy in 1892, Senator of the Depart
ment of Justice in 1900 and Procurator
General In 1901.
BT. PETERSBURG, Feb. B.âEmper

WANTS TO SEE IF GOMPERS
WEARS UNION CLOTHINQ
Tailor Raises the Question, but De
clines to Make Investigation
When Urged.
BLOOMINGTON, 111.. Feb. 7. â
When Samuel Gompers. president of
the American Federation of Labor,
finished a speech of thirty minutes to
the national convention of tailors,
Delegate Herman Nehaus of Pittsburg
arose and said that there was some
doubt as to whether Gompers was
wearing clothes with the union label
and moved that a committee be ap
pointed to investigate.
The motion caused a storm of pro
test, but Gompers quieted the dele
gates and suggested to the convention
that Nehaus /be appointed a committee
of one to investigate. The convention
shouted its approval, and Gompers
advanced to the front of the platform
and, pointing to Nehaua, urged him
to come forward, at the same time
opening his coat as If to display the
label. Nehaus remained in his seat,
and the delegates yelled in derision.
Gompers then explained that every
article of clothing he wore bore the
union label.
The Journeymen Tailors of America
to-day voted down the proposition
submitted by the socialists in the
form of a preamble to the constitution,
which was an indorsement of the Na
tional Socialist party, the vote being
102 to 28.

to-day Bigler Johnson pleaded guilty
to the charge that he murdered hla
wife, Maggie B. Johnson, and her
niece, Annie Benjamin, 10 years old,
in September last, and afterward
burned the bodies. The prisoner made
his plea of guilty and signed a state
ment without the faintest indication
of nervousness. He la 26 years old,
and his wife was 40.
In December his older brother,
Charles Johnson, was convicted of
murder as an accessory. His mother,
Mrs. Sophia Merrltt, and his sister
and brother, Nancy and Alanson John
son, were put on trial for the same
crime to-day. The five members of
the family, it is charged, went to Mag

LAURA BRIDE POWERS
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 7.â Owing to
the terrific downpour of Monday night
the train bearing the delegates to the
Federation of Women's Clubs meeting
did not arrive until 2:30 o'clock this
morning. Two hotels had buses to
meet the belated travelers. These and
two small street cars were pressed into
service to accommodate about 500 peo
ple, mostly women.
It is natural to suppose some lan
guage was used, particularly when it
was learned that rooms thought to
hayÂ« been reserved were not to be \
had for love or money â nor language, j
Though retiring at five this morning, I
the delegates and their friends, 250 of
them, were promptly on hand when, at
10 o'clock, Mrs. George Law Smith
called the convention to order in Slmp-
Bon Auditorium. The morning session ;
was given up to desultory discussion, :
the real work beginning in the after- â 
noon.
To-night the smart event of the week
Is on hand â the reception to the visitors
by the club women of Los Angeles at
Cummoch Hall. To-morrow will bring
out the real life of the week's conven
tion, when the election of officers oc

SCKEAMS BRING AID
Encounter Occurs Near the
Spot Where a Babe Dis
appeared Last August
Bpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Feb. 7.â At New Sweden,
on Bainbridge Island, yesterday the $-
year-old eon of Adolph Peterson was
attacked by a cougar, which tore out
the child's right â¢ye with its claws and
bit off two of his fingers. The boy's
breast was badly torn. He was un
conscious this morning, but It is be
lieved he will llvÂ«.
No one saw the animal make the at
tack. When his screams had attracted
rescuers the boy declared he had been
attacked by a bear, but from the de
scription of the animal his parents are
convinced that it was a cougar.
The child was attacked two miles
from the spot where Prewit Baker dis
appeared last August. At that time it
was claimed there were no animals of
the cougar family on Bainbridge Isl
and. This contention dispelled the be
lief of many that Prewit Baker was
carried off by a cougar. Yesterday's
occurrence has revived the theory that
the Baker child was carried off by wild
animals.

NOTED FIGHTERS
ARE THESE MEN
Heroes of Siege of Lady
smith Are Arriving Here
on Their Way to Far East
A band of sturdy British warriore,
who served valorously through the
most exciting battles in the recent
South African war, arrived in this city
last night and are staying at the
Palace and St_ Francis hotels.
There are seven in the company.
| which is a part of forty-two officers
i who have been assigned to duty in the
| Orient for the purpose of making ob
j servatlons that may be of value to the
British army, should the latter become
involved in the present war between
Russia and Japan.
At the head of the party is Hon.
Captain "Joe" Willoughby of the
Twenty-eighth Gloucester Fusileers,
who is rated in the British army as
one of its greatest daredevils and
who is one of the most Intimate friends
of Dr. Jameson and the late South
African celebrities, Cecil Rhodes and
Barney Barnato. In fact. Captain Wil
loughby was charged with being one of
the prime movers in the famous Jame
son raid that resulted in the bloody I
war between England and the Boers,
in which his distinguished services won
for him the Victoria Cross. His travel
ing companions are Lieutenants |
Charles S. Townsend, H. R. Hornsby, I
William Wesley, James C. Howe and |
George H. Paget, son of Sir Harry
Paget. They were accompanied north
by Captain Macdonald Vance, who
arrived here about a week ago with his
bride, then Journeyed south to Los
Angeles to meet them. Awaiting I
Willoughby and his fellow officers here
was Major Lynch Blosse, who arrived
aÂ£ the Palace three days ago.
Willoughby and his companions are
all heroes of the siege of Ladysmlth
and four of them â Vance, Townsend,
Howe and Blosse â share with him ttfe
distinction of wearing the Victoria
Cross, well earned in the terrible
strife in South Africa. Other officers
are due here Sunday night from Eng
land and others will follow closely aft
er them. With a view to exciting as
little attention as possible the 42 of
ficers were assigned to separate
parties, each of which came from
England by different routes, but un
der instructions to meet here and re
port to the British Consul General,
Courtenay W. Bennett, through whom
their final instructions will be trans
mitted before their departure for the i
Far East, which will be about- the end
of the month.
Major Lynch Blosse and Captain
Macdonald Vance, since their arrivals
in the United States, have abandoned
their bachelor lives, Rlosse having re
cently married the daughter of Charles
C. Germain, one of Chicago's million
aire grain manipulators. Vance found
a handsome wife in a Philadelphia
heiress. Accompanying the officers on
their trip to the Orient is J. A. Mac
donald, a grandson of Canada's former
Premier, who is manager of several
English papers, including the County
Family Illustrated. After their serv
ice in Manchuria the entire party will
proceed to India, where they will re
join their regiments.

RACING TO WARD
A BIG DEFICIT
Houses of Congress Elimi
nate the Word "Economy "
From Their Lexicon
LARGE APPROPRIATIONS
Expenditures Will Exceed
Ke venues at Least $50,<X>0,
000 for Next Fiscal Year
Special Dlscatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7.â Congress is
riding headlong for a great deficit at
the end of the next fiscal year unless
the President uges the veto power.
Thus far in the present fiscal year the
expenditures of the Government ex
ceed the receipts by $24,814,550 63. It
has generally been conceded that the
escaping of a deficit larger than that
which confronts thÂ« Government at the
end of the present fiscal year, on June
80, could be accomplished only by Con
gress exercising scrupulous economy.
But "economy" Is a word which Con
gress seems to have cut out of its lexi
con. Leaving out of consideration the
river and harbor bill and other meas
ures which are characterized as "pork
bills," It is clear that the appropria
tions of this session now in sight will
exceed thoge of last session by at least
$10,000,000. That is to say, the appro
priations that have been practically
agreed upon will be that much in ex
cess of the public money voted by the
last regular session.
It now appears that the river and
harbor bill will carry at least $17,000.
000. There is a companion "pork bill"
in the public building grab and it was
stated to-day that there was to be an
omnibus public building bill carrying
about $10,000,000. Then there is to be
an omnibus claims bill, which will car
ry, perhaps, $3,000,000 more.
Here In sight is an excess over last
year's appropriations of at least $40,
000,000. At this rate the next fiscal year
seems likely to close not with a deficit
of $24,000,000, such as is assured at the
close of the present business year, but
of $50,000,000 or $60,000,000, and perhaps
more.
Congress is deluding Itself with the
hope that the lavish estimate of in
creased revenue for the fiscal year end
ing June 3, 1906, supplied by the Treas
ury Department, will be realized.
There does not seem to be much ground
for such expectation.

TRAFFIC RUSH DC SOUTH.
Ten Crowded Trains Poor Into liom
Angeles From East.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 7.â Ten ortr
land trains from Chicago reached Los
Angeles to-day at half-hour Intervals,
causing an unprecedented congestion
of mail and express business. The
trains are the first to arrive from Chi
cago since Saturday. They were de
layed by washouts caused by the re
cent storm, which after drenching
Southern California, passed eastward
through Arizona and New Mexico*
flooding tracks, washing out fills and
making it impossible for the railway
companies to move trains with any
speed. On the Santa Fe, no trains had
reached Los Angeles since Thursday.
All the trains were heavily loaded ;
and the rush of business to the hotels
was greater even than that during a
big convention. Mall, which should
have been delivered last week, will not :
find the persons to who it is addressed '
probably for two days. There A such
a quantity of mail that every man In
the postal service here worked all day
and most of them remained on duty
all night Wells-Far^o & Company !
hired a dozen extra wagons to handle
the express and packages are piled al- ;
most to the roof of their depot build- '

To Whom It May Concern: After treat-

for the past six years I called en Dr.
Wong Him. He made a simple- examina-
tion by feeling the pulse and explained my
case rally. I asked him if he could curei
It. â¢ He said yes. in from six to eight weeks,
which I can truthfully say he did. The
physicians here think him a wonder. Any
one writing mÂ« I will be only too Â«tad and
thankful to answer. I can cheerfully rec-
ommend him la the very worst casts of
enema, as my case wa* known to be one
of the most stubborn on record. ThÂ«

C a car ass at the shop of

It was on Third street, at 4 o'clock
last Monday morning, that Messrs.
Anderson and Gibson were overhauled
by Patrolman George A. Sullivan. Be
tween them H suspended the sheep
and they were very drunk. The meat
was subsequently identified by Mr.
Muller as his property.
An attorney from OaMand addressed
Police Judge Conlan for the defense.
His clients, he said, were not common
sheep-stealers, but gentlemen of ex
emplary character and highly esteemed
in their home town across the bay.
They had been school chums, and for
ten years had not seen u.-h other until
last Sunday afternoon, when they
accidentally met at Twenty-ninth
street and Broadway. The reunion
v. as cemented with liquor, and the
spree there inaugurated was conveyed
to this city and kept up to proper pitch
until the last ferry-boat had departed.
Then the celebrants decided to make
& night of It. They traveled much and
frequently imbibed imtll their total
absorption of intoxicants was not less
than fifty drinks apiece. The pen
chant of Mr. Anderson for appropriat
ing other people's mutton was mani
fested many times, and Mr. Gibson
restrained it until his patience gave
out.
"What is your vocaition?" the Judge
asked Mr. Gibson.
*"A medical student," was the reply.
"And yours?" said the court to Mr.
Andt n
"I'm a house-mover," came the
answer.

His wife's maternal relative. Mrs.

"And what's more," he informed
Judge Mogan. "she amioyed me aB

!andf-d some poor unfortunate."
"If there were no better husbands
than you are nobody would advertise
for one." was Mrs. Walters' withering
retort.
Th^n the Judge told Mr. O'Rorke
that Mrs. Walters' matrimonial affairs
cut no figure whatsoever In the case
under consideration. It was clearly
proven that for five months he had
not contributed one cent to the sup
port of his wife and child, so he was
pronounced guilty as charged and or
dered to appear for sentence to-day.
David Robinson and Francis James,

oil from a Seventh-street pickle fac

It was not the attistic defects so*
much as the physical imperfections of
the banjoist that provoked Thomas
Spellman to peace disturbance in one
of the chear^ vaudeville theaters on
Market street. Indeed there was no
member of the audience who made less
pretension to music culture than did
Mr. SDellman, nor one who was more i
tolerant of the programme prior to the
banjoist's appearance. No sooner,
however, did the bearer of the "African
harp" show his elongated self on the
stage â In fact, ere he had twanged a
stringâ than Mr. Spellman's spirit of
aversion was in play. For the man
was so tall, thin and crooked of torso
and limb as to anger those whom the
sight of him neither amused nor ;
moved to sympathy. Mr. Spellman
was of the former contingent. A con
noisseur of physical grace. Irrespective
of the sex of its bearer- he considered
the presentation of the banjoist's gen
eral ungainliness an insult to his
vision. He shut his eyes and curbed
his wrath, however, hoping that what
the banjoist lacked in manly beauty
would be compensated for by excellence
of instrumentation. Vain hope! The
aural visitation was. if possible, more ,
harrowing than the optical offense. So
with fingers Inserted in ears and head
averted Mr. Spellman rose in his
wrath and exclaimed so loudly that
all present heard the words:
"Git off. Slats! Ter de long grass
wid ye!"
Then he hurled his hat at the ban
joist, who was fulfilling the program
med announcement that he would play
"Echoes From the Cotton Fields, with
Variations of Popular Southern Melo
dies." An adept in banjo-plucking was
heard to remark that the variations
were created by the Inadvertent
sounding of wrong notes.
The special policeman attached to
the theater arrested Mr. Spellman and
charged him with having disturbed
the pence, ''â¢id before Judge Fritz the
defense Â»as set up that the term
"Slats" -.as not addressed to the ban
joist at ill. but to an emaciated friend
whom Mr. Spellman recognized in the
audience: aiso, that the hat-throwing
was not in anger, but in playfulness,
the target being the friend aforemen
tioned. . â

MISSING GEMS
Mystery Surrounding Dis
appearance of Holbrook
Jewelry Quickly Solved
â¢
MISLAID BY HUSBAND
Porter. Ignorant of Box's
Contents, Stores it Away
in a Room at St. Francis
The mystery surrounding the dis
uppearanee of a box of diamonds be
longing to Mrs. E. M. Holbrook of Min
neapolis, a guest of the St. Francis
Hotel, on the eve of her departure for
the north on Monday evening, was
cleared yesterday. Shortly after 10
o'clock yesterdny morning the $8090
worth of treasures were found in the
storeroom of the St. Francis, where
they had been deposited by one of the
loi ters of the hostelry. When the dia
monds wore first missed Monday night
at the Oakland mole Millionaire Hol
brook wps certain that he had them
>vith him up to the time of leaving a
carriage at the ferry, and promptly
wired the hotel management to look
up the driver of the vehicle with the
hope of recovering them.
It was discovered yesterday, how
ever, that Holbrook had carelessly left
the Jewelry cufe in the basement of
tho hotel v.hil? arranging for the ship
1 ing of his trunks. He found it neces
sary to leave several other small ar
ticles behind him. and after he and
his wife had aeparted for the ferry
the night pr.rter. little realizing thÂ«?
vilue of the jewelry box, picked It >
ap with the other articles and put the
' package away in a storeroom on the
j top floor of the hotel.
Yesterday while the search for the
missing valuables was continuing Head
Porter Smith suddenly noticed a mem
orandum on his blotter of the Holbrook
package, and. hurrying up to the top
fioor, instituted an investigation that
brought to li&ht the diamonds safely
reposing in thoir receptacle among the
sther less valuable property of the
Minnesota millionaire lumberman. As
soon as the matter v.as reported to
Manager Woods he wired the Hol
brooks and is now awaiting instruc
tions from them regarding the disposi
tion of Mrs. Holbrook's diamonds.
WHOLESALE GROCERS DEXY
FILING OF A CO3LPLAIXT
Story of Dissatisfaction Concerning
Awarding of Xavy Supplies Con
tracts Is Contradicted.
Wholesale grocers last evening dis
puted a story in an afternoon paper
that there is dissatisfaction among
the trade on account of the manner in
which contracts are awarded for
navy supplies that are delivered at
Mare Island. The substance of the
story was that complaint had been
fiitd at Washington against Pay In
spector L. C. Kerr by wholesale gro
cers. If such is in existence no gro
cer has any knowledge of it. It was
alleged that John Rothschild & Co.
have been getting a large share of the
contracts, and the firms of Guggen
hime fc Co., the Lewin-Meyer Com
pany and Getz Brothers were men
tioned among others as having failed
to get contracts where their bids were
shown to be lower than thoÃe of
Rothschild.
S&m Meyer of the Lewin-Meyer
Company denied emphatically that his
concern had made any protest or that
it was in any way dissatisfied. J.
Fieishman of Guggenhlme & Co. said
his concern was satisfied with the way '
business has been transacted and had â 
no complaint to make. Frank S. John
son of the Johnson-Locke Mercantile ,
Company said that the business was â 
entirely satisfactory and that there
was no complaint against the navy
pay office. At the headquarters of
the Wholesale Grocers' Association no
complaint has been filed for trans- ;
mission by grocers, nor had such com
plaint been previously heard of in the ,
office. F. W. Van Sicklen of Dodge, '
Sweeney & Co. said:
Since the Spanish-American War we have
done considerable business with the Navy De
partment and It has always been very satis
factory. In moil instances the propoeals are
sent to us from Washington. We send our
bids there and forward samples to Mare Isl
and. We assume that the paymaster at Mare
Island examines the samples and reports to
Washington, where the award is made. When
therÂ«" are rush orders we submit our bids
to the paymaster here and the goods are ac
'.cpted or rejected at Mare Island. We do
considerable business with John Rothschild
and consider him an excellent Judge of goods.
He has made a study and specialty of navy
business.

Witness in Dunsmuir Case Holds to

Charles J. Okell of the Employers' <

an uncomfortable day on the stand
under the cross-questioning of Attor- |
ney Wheeler in the Dunsmuir case j
jt-sterday at the British Consulate. |
Okell on his direct testimony told
of a conversation he had with J. A. S.
Lowe, former manager of the Duns
muir Company. Lowe was one of the
witnesses to the Dunsmuir will and. in
hiJ< testimony in British Columbia and '
in this city, said that he knew the in
strument which he witnessed ' was .a '
will. p^iS^s ;â ;. i
Okell has testified that Lowe, after
giving his testimony, admitted, to him*
that he did not know the nature of |
the document at the time he affixed :
his signature. Under California; pro- ;
bate law this would render the instru- '
ment void. j
Despite the rigid cross-examination I
by Wheeler, Okell . stuck Â« to his testi- I

FEARS SUMMONS
IN WIFE'S SUIT
Victoria 3lan Fails to Ap
pear in Court to Press
Writ of Habeas Corpus
H. L. Salmon, the man from Vic
toria, B. C, who has secreted two
of his children and is endeavoring to
get custody of the third by a writ of
habeas corpus, failed to appear in
Judge Hebbard's court yesterday for
a hearing of his writ. The attorney
for Mrs. Salmon charged that Salmon
was staying away to avoid service of
summons in his wife's suit for divorce.
In answer to the writ, Mrs. Salmon
answered that sjie is a proper person
to have the custody of her infants and
she denied her husband's charges of
infidelity. Judge Graham, to whom
the divorce case has been assigned,
gave the mother a partial victory yes
terday, by ordering that she should
have custody of the three children
pending the hearing of the case.
Judge Hebbard denied the divorce
asked for by Irene Jensen, who charged
Hans Jensen with various acts of
cruelty, including a disclaimer of the
paternity of their three-year-old child.
After Mrs. Jensens testimony was
heard, the husband's attorney pro
duced letters written by the wife a
short time before she sued, in whicn
she addressed her husband in endear
ing terms and expressed a desire to
return to him.
Divorces were granted by Judge
Hebbard to Julia X". Shields from Wil
liam J. Shields, intemperance; Judge
Murasky to Albert M. Duff from Mary
Duff, desertion;* Judge Graham to
Margaret Bevering from William Bev
ering, neglect; by Judge Seawell to
J. H. Van Home from Eloise Van
Home, desertion: to Mamie Bartlett
from Jesse Bartlett. annulment because
of a former marriage.
Frank B. Smith seeks a divorce from
Adeline Smith, whom he married in
ISBB, on the grounds of her intemper
ance and habit of assaulting him weekly
with household utensils. They have
seven children, the youngest an un
named boy. two months old.
Other actions for divorce were begun
hy Emma M. White against Daniel J.
White, cruelty : Isabella Papworth
against Frederick Papworth, cruelty:
Thomas H. Ervin against Maggie
Ervin, intemperance: Annie Collins
against Thomas J. Collins, intemper

MUST PAY TAX
ON INHERITANCE
Judge Coffey Overrules Ob
jections 3lade by Heirs
of Nevada Capitalist
Judge Coffey yesterday afternoon
confirmed the report of Special Ap
pra'ser K. C. Harrison upon the por
tion of the estate of J. M. Douglass sub
ject to inheritance tax in this State,
and the two nephews of the deceased,
who will divide $634,926 17 of their
uncle's fortune between them, must
ccntribute J15.573 15 each to the CaM
fornia treasury. Mr. Harrison's ap
praisement is more than ,$70,000 higher
than, the value of the California estate
reported by the executors on Monday,
making a goodly sum in favor of the
estate. The discrepancy is due to the
fact that Mr. Harrison appraised the
Douglass securities at the market price
obtainable on the day following the
death of the Nevada capitalist, while
the later inventory purported to take
existing values. TJn this account Har
rison's figures place Spring Valley
shares at $40 each, as against $35 in the
luter report, and his valuation of Con
fa Cot>ta shares was $40, as against
$20 obtainable now. Douglass o\\ r.ed
i:,i!00 shares in the Spring Valley Com
pany.
Major Huffaker, the Nevada attor
ney of R. L. and J. M. Douglass, heirs
and executors of the estate, appeared
before Judge Coffey to object to the
proceedings, and moved that the spe
cial appraisement be referred back to
th'? appraiser pending the set
tlement <>f the question of the
ourt's jurisdiction, which he at
tacked. He raised a point never be
fore made in regard to the inheritance
lax law. He contended that the local
court had no jurisdiction in the mat
ter, because Douglass owned no real
estate in this county. He owned $100
worth of realty in El Dorado
County, and the inheritance tax would
have to be settled by the court there.
Judge Coffey admitted that the point
was novel, but after Assistant City
Attornoy Partridge and E. C. Harri
son had combated the point with the
contention that the local court had ac
quired the jurisdiction through its jur
isdiction in the probate matters of the
estate the Jud?e ruled against Major
Huffaker and approved the report.
Huffaker admitted that the tax was
an obligation and should be paid, and
there will probably be no further diffi
culty excepting over the minor matters
of expenses for the last illness and
funeral of Douglass and attorney's fees
to bo paid. An account of the exec
utors was filed and approved, with the
exception of an item of $672S paid by
the executors cut of the money in Cal
ifornia to Huffaker for services per
formed for Douglass during his life
time. Huffaker said there was not
money enough in the Nevada estate to
pay the claim, and it had been paid
by the executors without securing an
order of court.

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
OLNEY ORDERS THE WITHDRAWAL
OF FELTON TAYLOR FROM TICKET
Oakland's Mayor Issues Letter Ex
plaining His Reason for
Taking Action.
OAKLAND, Feb. 7.â Political inter
est centered to-day over the with
drawal of Felton Taylor from the nom
ination for Treasurer on the Repub
lican ticket at the command of Mayor
Warren Olney. Few suspected such an
outcome, though many knew of the
charges, and even Mr. Taylor himself
did not reach a conclusion as to his ac
tions until at the close of a conference
with his friends that lasted until mid
night.
It became evident to-day that with
the resignation of Mr. Taylor from the
Republican ticket the incident
would be dropped as far as Mr. Tayloi :
and Mayor Olney were concerned. This
was settled when Mayor Olney Issued
his statement this afternoon. Mr. Tay
lor contented himself with sending a
formal resignation to the Republican
City Central Committee this morning.
He refused to further discuss the mat
ter. The Mayor's statement is as fol
lows:
Mr Taylor violated the clear letter and
spirit of the law. whÂ«n lie deposited a por
tion of the city's money in a bank, taking
back oertlfieates of deposit.
That It ha<- been cuetomary for cuetodian*
â¢f public funds to do co does not Justify It. I
cannot find that Mr. Taylor has profited in any
Â» - ay by the transaction. He cays he has not,
and he ie a truthful man. Besides he Is cor
roborated in thi* particular by the banker
friends whom he has allowed (following aa
unlawful custom) to use the city's money.
Ac Mayor I could not . Ignore ihe violation
of the law. Mr. Taylor has been sufficiently
punished.
The question of candidates was
sprung immediately and five names
were offered. Charles D. Bates Jr.,
Georg^E. Gross, present Deputy Treas
urer; Edwin Meese, City Councilman;
George Fitzgerald, City Councilman,
and Frank Thompson, City Clerk. The
fight narrowed down to Gross and
Bates, and when the Republican City
Committee met to-night to fill the va
cancy Charles D. Bates Jr. waa chosen
The Republican City Committee or
ganized by electing Frank W. Bilger
as chairman, Ed Planer as secretary
and Clinton G. Dodge aa treasurer.

MEAT COMPANY
WINS ITS SUIT
Court Decides That Butchers
Were Trying to Get Both
Wages and Strike Benefits
SHOWS INCONSISTENCY
Judo-e, 8. P. Hall Orders Dis
satisfied Employes to. Pay
the Costs of Their Action
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, Feb. 7.
The butchers who .recently brought
suits against the California Co-opera
tice Meat Company, organized for their
special benefit, were defeated in court
to-day when a Judgment was rendered
against them by Judge S. P. Hall. The
company was formed during the recent
butchers' strike to aid the men who
had been thrown out of employment.
John L. Davie, manager of the com
pany, said in court to-day that the
business was started on a "shoe
string," but that it had paid and made
money.
It was shown that H. Rauch, E. G.
Lapham, M. G. Strong and J. Ziegler
had put in claims against the com
pany aggregating $234 75, which they
alleged was due them for back wages.
The cross-examination developed the
fact that they went to work with the
understanding that their strike benefits
of $7 50 a week should be applied on
their wages, and now they were at
tempting to collect this money from the
company. Judge "Hall held that it was
inconsistent to suppose that they
would be allowed to receive $7 50 a
week benefits and hold their employ
ment at the same time.
The company admitted an Indebted
ness of $118 25, which it was willing to
pay, but according to Judge Hall's
figuring there was only duo $112 50. and
he ordered that as the plaintiffs had
failed to make out their case they
would also have to pay the costs,
amounting to $24 25. Â»
EDITOR ROASTS
GLEE CLUB MEN
University Singers Accused
of Flirting: During a Con
cert at Mills College
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center street, Feb. 7.
The members of the University Glee
Clvb â some of them â stand accused
of flirting from the platform of the
Mills College Concert Hall with the
pretty maidens who gathered there a
few days ago to hear the college chaps
warble the merry glpes of commerce.
They are invited by thÂ£ editor of the
Californian, the students' daily of the
university, to believe that they are not
really gentlemen, only "kids," un
worthy to represent the university as
glee club members, and deserving of
an excoriation most severe, which he
gives them.
Joseph P. Loeb has raised a storm
about his ears by printing a letfding
editorial in the Californian, reflecting
on the conduct of the glee club men
on the occasion in question. Loeb
edits the Californian. His predeces
sor, W. T. Hale, was suspended from
college for roasting, with more or less
warmth, the faculty of the university
during the celebrated episode in which
Captain Nance played the star part,
with the students appearing on the
stage principally in the mob scenes.
Loeb has not hitherto toyed other
than gently with the faculty, in his
editorials, but is believed to have
broken Hale's record for free and easy
speech in his discussion of the student
body's manners, *as represented by the
glee club during its recent perform
ance at Mills College, a seminary
for girls. Â»
Loeb's editorial in part is as fol
lows:
When the Glee (Hub gave a concert at Mills
College Friday evening several of the men
disgusted a large percentage of their audl
once by undisguised attempts to flirt from
the platform. If a man's self-respect Is nut
great enough to keep him from getting up on
a stage to make a fool of himself he. can do
much less harm to the university if he Is al
lowed to sever his connection with the Glee
Club and perform thereafter as a private in
dividual and under his own name. For the
Brood name of California these Irresponsible
youngsters should be dropped from the Glee
Club or measures taken to prevent a repeti
tion of such harmful asinlnity.

MAYOR OLXEY SIGXB
WATER BOND ORDINANCE
Measufe to Submit Project for a
Municipal Supply Becomes a
Law by That Act.
OAKLAND, Feb. 7. â Mayor Olney |
to-day signed the bond election or
dinance, which calls the municipal
water supply election for March 11. J
This completes all of the legal re
quirements preliminary to holding the
election except the publication of the
tall.
The proposition to be submitted to
the voters is the Bay Cities Water
Company's projected plan to furnish
a plant of 20,000,000 gallons daily
capacity at a cost of $3,750,000 and
the construction of a distributing pipe
line system, costing $1,950,000. It
will require a two-thirds affirmative

SUPPOETS ESPEY BILL
His Honor Going: to Sacra

Effort to Stop the Spoil
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, Feb. 7.
Mayor Olney announced to-day that j
he would appear before the Legisla- '
ture to-morrow to urge the passage of |
the Espey bill against horse racing.
His Honor vigorously took the posi
tion that he intended to go before the |
committee in his official capacity and
to represent the city in his support of I
the measure.
The Mayor said he believed the â¢
proximity of the Emeryville race i
I course to Oakland is demoralizing to i
I this city. Believing that, he felt it !
his duty to present his views at the
State Capitol. Further Mayor Olney
said:
Oakland is receiving throughout the United
States the reputation of belnfj a wide open
city of jramblers because of that raee
i track. Although It Is practically a part of
L the city, we have no Jurisdiction over the
i track because its management controls the
Incorporated town of Emeryville and will pre
vent any attempt to annex it to Oakland. I
am convinced that hundreds of our young
men and young women and our older fools
are ruined every year at the racetrack. I am ,
. so thoroughly convinced tnat It Is a detri-
I ment to Oakland that I am going to go on
record at Sacramento, as a matter oÂ£ duty.
In favor of Assemblyman Espey" s bill.
That much I owe to this community aa
its Mayor, and that much shall be donÂ«. no
matter whether my speech shall be heard by
unwilling or willing listeners.
The racetrack is a disgrace to the city and
a shame on the community which without
protest permits It to operate.
NO LIGHT DISCOVERED
IN THE LUBBEN CASE
Principals and Teachers Cannot Find
Evidences of Hazing and
Rough Play.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 7. â No action was
taken by the Board of Education to
night in the matter of the death of
Clarence Lubben, which was alleged
to have been caused by hazing at the
Longfellow School. Fred T. Moore,
Superintendent of Schools, reported
that he had made a thorough investi
gation at the school. He had not
found that any hazing had taken place
nor could he place the blame for Lub
ben's injuries.
At the request of Frank Otis, the
president of the board, the principals
cf all the schools were at the meeting.
Each said that all possible precautions
were taken against rough play. Dr.
Georgo F. Thompson, principal of the
High School, said that during the first
week of the term several boys had been
tossed in a large canvas, but none had
been injured. He did not consider this
practice any more dangerous than
football or baseball, and had not or
dered it stopped nor should he do so
unless so directed by the board.
Dr. W. K. Scott said he thought all
tossing should be stopped. No action
was taken in the matter and in
structions were issued to the princi
pals of the other schools.
A committee from the West End Im
provement Association was present and
a letter from the association asking
that the death of Lubben be investi
gated was read, but the committee
asked no questions and took no part in
the investigation.
AFFECTIONS OF PROFESSOR
RECEIVE SEVERE SHOCK
Maiden He Was to Wed in Japan
Loses Heart to Another While
En route.
BERKELEY, Feb. 7. â Friends of
Miss Ollie White and Professor Carey
Richard Colburn, formerly of the Uni
versity of California, learned with sur
prise to-day that Miss White, who left
for the Orient a month ago to wed
Professor Colburn in Japan, lost her
heart to a passenger on the steamer
c:; route, and married him, instead of
the professor, almost immediately aft
er her arrival in Japan.
Miss White graduated from the Uni
versity of California last year and un
t'i a month ago was a school teacher
in Petaluma. She had known Profes
sor Colburn when he was a reader At
the university. He obtained a pro
fessorship in the Japanese commercial
college in Tokio and sent for Miss
White. She became acquainted on
the way to Japan with >a passenger
who pleased her\ and when she was
met in Japan by the waiting fiance,
announced to him that her heart was
anothers' â she could not marry him.
Professor Colburn is said to have
taken the blow philosophically, and
to have been one of the guests at the
wedding of his former fiancee. He has
written of the affair, without, how
ever, mentioning the name of his suc
cessful rival.
SAYS PRICE HAS BEEN
PUT UPON* HIS HEAD
Cliincse Accused of Giving Police In-
formation Declares Countr>men
Seek His Life.
BERKELEY, Feb. 7. â Ge Lim, a
Chinese cook at Boones Academy, has
given out a story that the hatchet
men of his race, resident In Berkeley,
and employed for the most part in
the gentle art of laundrying the clothes
of Americans, have put a price on his
head, because he revealed to an out
sider facts about the fantan games
alleged to have been played on Dwight
Way and Shattuck avenues.
Ge lAm says little red posters, an
nouncing in Chinese characters that
$300 would be paid for the murder of
the marked man. have been posted in
the Chinese quarter of Berkeley. Ge
suspected that one Jue Sing, said to
be the chaperon of the gambling
games, was responsible for the "price
on his head v circular and informed
the alleged highbinder that the cir
culars must come down, or the plot
would be revealed to the police of
Berkeley. '
Ge Lim was assured that he had
misinterpreted the red circulars â that
the documents merely announced a
bargain sale of high-class junk in one
of the Chinese resorts. The Marshal's
office was informed of the affair, and
Ge Lim has been assured that he will
be protected, so far as possible.

FISHER IS OUT
FOR TRUSTEE
West Berkeley Saloon Man
Gets Into the Game and
Fight of Local Politics
HAS KOW WITH CHOCH
Since That Time He Has Xot
Been Able to Get License
From the town Trustees
Berkeley OfUce San Francisco Call.
2113 Center Street, Feb. 7.
A certain very fa>nous rummage sale
has at last got into politics, and Sam
Fisher of West Berkeley will appeal
from courts. Juries and Town Tru9tees
to the voters of his ward. He an
nounces that he will be an independent
candidate for Town Trustee from the
Sixth Ward, the position now held by
Thomas Dowd. But it is the story of
how Sam Fisher came to make this an
nouncement that is more interesting
i ha n his candidacy.
Sam Fisher, who saw service in the
Philippines with the United States
army, ran a saloon in West Berkeley
for a number of years, which he called
The Canteen, in remembrance of his
old army life. One day about a year
and a half as?o a rummage sale waa
started near Fisher's place by one of
the West Berkeley churches, and in
the excess of enthusiasm, inspired by
some West Berkeley whisky, Fisher
did sundry and various things to that
rummage sale that damage.d stock and
furniture and injured the feelings of
the participants.
For this a campaign was begun
against Fisher. He was arrested and
pleaded guilty to an overindulgence In
liquor. Then the church people went
after his license and had it revoked,
and for a year and a half Fisher haa
run his* saloon without that necessary
document. Many, many times Fisher
nas been arrested for selling liquor
without a license, but never once haa
he been convicted.
At the beginning of the new year
Fisher again applied for permission to
sell liquor within the law. The light
was renewed, and the Trustee* of
Berkeley refused to grant him the per
mit. The town election is now ap
proaching, and Fisher says that he is
going to make a fight for a place on
the town board. He said yesterday:
"I shall run as an independent, and
shall seek no party nomination, though
I should not refuse it if it were given
me. I have done everything in my
power to make amends for what has
been done, and if I cannot get per
mission to run my business like any
one else I am going to get into poli
tics and see what I can do for my
self."

Delmas Makes Strong Point
SHOWN THAT FATHER
SETTLED SON'S DEBTS
JOHX H. TOEEi,. ONE OF THE CONTESTANTS OF THE WIIX, OF J ALEX- !
ANDER YOELL, WHO WAS OX THE WITNESS STAND YESTERDAY, AND
ATTORNEY L>. M. DELMAS. BY WHOM HE WAS CROSS-EXAMINED. .
The promised sensation in the Yoell
*ill contest began to develop yester-
John EL Yoell. one of the dis-
BBCSj was on the stand
fay and under a steady stream of
ouestions put by Attorney D. M. Del
gave evidence damaging to ihe
f the contestants.
Documents to prove that the dead
Clara Dioneer had come to the
assistance of his son time and again
v. hen the younger man was in finan
cial straits were produced hy the at
lorney. At the start young Yoell pos
itively asserted that his father had
not assisted him to the extent of a dol
lar since his college days. The faded
bits of - ting produced by Delmas
tol<* a different tale. By them was
D that tvhen the son and his
mother were unable to meet urgent
financial obligations the money to save
them was advanced from J. Alexander
Yoell's puree.
On the back of a copy of one note
to Patrick Hannon for $2425, signed
by John H. Yoell and his mother, Em
ily Yocil. is a pencil note in the dead
pioneer's handwriting. It reads, "In
dorsed at the special request of Mrs.
Yoell to prevent her suicide."
Document â  â¢â¢â¢â¢ document of the
same nature were produced by Delmas
and read. *Another 'into for $ISOO
l>orÂ» the marking In the elder Yoell's
writing, "Mrs. Yoell made me go on
this."
The witness admitted that at an
other time his father paid $4885
which he (the son) had borrowed
from residents of San Jose. "We had
a sort of general cleanup at the office
and my father paid the notes," ex
plained Yoell.
ier the persiEfnt fire of ques
young Yoell often showed signs
-patience. At one time he blurt
.t. Oh, that was some crazy idea
; father's." In the same smooth
tone of voice that prated on the wlt
f-f-rs all day Detauta moved to
have the words stricken from the tes
timony as being disrespectful to the
dead.
Another time Yoell wanted to tell
that ar advanced to himself

tlement with his wife. This assertion
was ilso stricken out. Delmas main
taining that the document of the set
tlement was the best evidence.
Delmas brought out the fact that
young Yoell had motgaged a law lib
rary given to him by his father. The
witness seemed nettled by the expres
sion, "your father's library." '"It was
my library." he asserted. Then Del
mas brought out the fact that Mrs.
Yoell had induced the father to give
the library to the son and that it had
been pawned a few days later to raise
funds to meet a financial obligation
of a peculiar kind.
Young Yoell had been given $1000
by a San Jose client to be paid on a
note when it became due. Yoell us~d
the money and when the note became
due was unable to meet it. To raise
money he mortgaged the library given
to him by his father.
Pi 'in the evidence produced John
H. Yoell was frequently in suÂ«h
straits. He ai.d his mother often need
f-d the assistance of J. Alexander
Yoell. All this was advanced to prove
that the old pioneer's life was embit
tered by the conduct of the son who
is a prime mover in contesting the
will.
At the start the witness was slow
!init his own handwriting. "I am
not a handwriting expert," ho assert
ed. But later he quietly admitted the
damaging documents showered upon
him by Delmas. In four years the
amounts purported to have been paid
by the elder Yoell for his son and
Mrs. Yoell aggregated nearly $9000.
A little tiff between Delmas and At
torney Rix enlivened the morning ses
sion. Rix objected to the mode of
procedure taken by Delmas. "I have
been long enough in this profession to
know what is correct." said Delmas.
â  Yes. but wisdom does not always
go with age." retorted Rix. "Judge?"
asked Attorney Delmas in his most
urbane manner. The court sustained
Delmas.
Three of the dissatisfied daughters
were interested listeners at the trial.
The case will be resumed at 10:30 to
day.

Tax Clerk Opposes Discharge.
I. M. Silver, an extra clerk in the :
office of Tax Collector Edward J. !
Smith, who was certified for the po- j
sition on August 1 last, yesterday sued !
for an injunction to prevent the Tax i
Collector from discharging him ex
cept upon formal written charges.
Silver contends that the position of
extra clerk comes under the classiflca- i
tion of "ordinary clerks" in the civil I
service and he cannot be discharged '
without cause. He was notified by â¢
Smith on Monday that his services \
would be no longer required. Smith !
says that he Is acting under orders of j
the Civil Service Commission, there
being other clerks ahead of Silver on

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. WEDNESDAY. FEBRUARY 8, 1905.
THREE LAWYERS
DISPLAY ANGER
Bridgford Eefuses to Bead
Paper Until Instructed to
Do So by the Court
CLUXIE IS RESENTFUL
Meets White's Insinuations
With Beflections Involv
ing Professional Integrity
Clunle, Bridgford and White each :
had an opportunity to show temper yes- ;
terday in the tempestuous examination ]
Into the affairs of the executors of the â 
estate of Thomas J. Clunie and Judge '
Coffey continued his efforts to curb the
paesionate outbreaks. Judge Bridg- |
ford's departure from the regularity
expected from a witness on the stand
was momentary and ineffective. Olunie
was questioning him about the settle- i
ment with Mrs. Clunie and whether or !
not she had declined to take property
under ihe will. Biidgford had an- j
swered in his own way when Clunie j
handed him Mrs. Clunie's petition for j
a partial distribution of the estate.
"Read that." said Clunie, "and then :
answer my question."
Bridgford, with an angry gesture, i
threw the paper upon Judge Coffey's '
desk and said, "I wijl not read it. You
cannot make me read anything I do
not want to." "Then, ' said Clunie,
I'll appeal to the court to instruct you
to read it.' Bridgford turned to Judge
Coffey and said: "He digtates to me
as if I was a schoolboy." "Pay no at
tentlon to his manner," said the court j
softly, <- but 1 think you would better '
read the paper to refresh your mem- i
ory."
Wh'.n Burrell White was recalled
Clunie went into the matter of the
employment of Chester Bridgford to
keep the books of the estate. White
said that Clunie had suggested it.
Clunie referred to a "friendly" conver- ;
sation about the subject, whereupon
white interrupted with:
"Oh, you're only friendly when you '
want to use a man. You would be
friendly to me and then ask me for
money. I took assignments of your
interest in the estate and made you
advancements of over $50,000."
Clunie was enraged. "Wasn't it my
money?" he shouted. "I'll ask you if
the largest advancement I took wasn't i
to save you $3200 ?" It developed in
the examination that this had to do j
with the Harcourt loan and note, the
payment of which White guaranteed, 1
and with the subsequent sale of the
property. Clunie repeated that he had
"helped White out 6"f a hole" and then
White, pointing an accusing finger at
his interlocutor, said: "Yes. >*ou took ;
a half interest in the property and I
took half and then you forced me to j
pay $2500 more." This aroused Clunie
again and he demanded a full expla- '
nation. He said that White would
have the court believe that he was a
"highway robber" and "had stood him
up." "I want to show up this whole
transaction." he said, and he proceeded
to cast intimated reflections upon
White's integrity in his law practice. .
The court remarked that "this is get- I
ting interesting" and the further hear- j
ing was continued until this afternoon, j

DEATH OF A WELL-KXOWN
PIONEER OF CALIFORNIA
Harrison C. Jones Taken Suddenly 111
Succumbs to Operation at St.
Luke's Hospital.
Harrison C. Jones, a well-known
merchant of this city, was taken sud
denly ill Saturday night and It was
found necessary to remove him to St.
Luke's Hospital to have an operation
performed. His weak vitality and
â¢weight of years were not able to
stand the shock, and after lying in a
stupor for several hours he passed
away.
Deceased was a pioneer of Califor
nia. H<? came to this State from the
East in 1851. Five years ago he cele
brated his golden wedding.
The funeral will take place in
Healdsburg, where his wife and son
are both buried. Deceased leaves a
son and daughter, J. J. Jones and
Mrs. Hattie Pries of this city.
Wife Gets $100 a Month.
The Supreme Court decided yester
day that John Gay of San Diego must
pay $100 a month toward his wife's
maintenance while their suit for di
vorce remains unsettled. Mrs. Gay
began the contest, but her husband
got a decree on his cross complaint.
She gave notice of appeal, and pend
ing action by the Supreme Court, Gay
was ordered to pay her $100 a month.
He appealed from that judgment. The
action for divorce is before the Su
preme Court at present, but some
time is likely to elapse before an
opinion in the matter is handed down.
Gay Is said to be worth $400,000.

SANTA FE
ASSERTS GROCER
SHARED SPOILS
Albert Lake Makes Confes
sion of His Forgeries, Im
plicating: Samuel Flexner
Albert Lake, the defaulting confi
dential clerk of Robert Trost, contrac
tor, Army street, who was brought
from Seattle on Monday night by De
tective Cody on a warrant charging
him with forgery, has made a full con
fession implicating Samuel Flexner,
formerly a grocer at Twenty-sixth and
Howard streets. Lake got from Trost
checks to pay to lumbermen and others,
but instead of handing them to the
proper persons Jie gave them to Flex
ner, who cashed them at the Western
National Bank, where he had an ac
count, after Lake had forged the name
of the payee on the back.
When the warrant was issued for
Lake's arrest last October after his
disappearance, Flexner was asked to
pay a visit to police headquarters. He
was Questioned about the checks and
told a plausible story about Lake com
ing to him always after banking hours
and getting the money, as it was
urgently needed. His story was be
lieved, but Flexner did not care to wait
for further developments and sold out
his grocery for $4100. It is said that
he is now somewhere in the East.
Lake in his confession says that
Flexner got the half of each check that
was cashed and besides Flexner
charged $2 commission for his trouble
in going to the bank to cash each
check. The last check cashed was for
$662 on October 18 and with his share,
$331 less $2 commission, Lake fled from
the city. The total amount obtained
in that way was $1800. Flexner had
$700 in the bank which the bank seized,
30 that the bank is out only $1100 and
Flexner is in only $200 and his com
missions.
When arrested in Seattle Lake was
living under the name of Bert Mason.
He was tracked by the Pinkerton
agency. Whether an effort will he
made to find Flexner in view of Lakes
confession has not yet been decided.
Promoter Sues for Accounting.
The promoters of the Petaluma and
Santa Rosa electric lines, now in
course of construction, have disa
greed, and in a suit for the dissolu
tion of their copartnership one ac
cuses the other of withholding nearly
all of the profits of the enterprise,
amounting to more than $15,000. The
action was begun yesterday by Charles
Towne against Alfred D. Bowen, and
the complaint recites that they
agreed on April 1, 1903, to promote
the organization of a company to
build a railroad in Sonoma County,
each to have share and share alike in
the profits. It is declared that the
partnership has acquired assets of
more than $15,000. a large portion of
which has heen obtained *by Bowen,
"wrongfully, fraudulently and with
the intent to deceive" his partner.
Towne says he has demanded an ac
counting and the payment of his
share, which have been refused. He
believes the aggregate due him is
more than $6000.

REFI'SES TO PASS ON
THE FIT OF DRESS
Judpr Lawson Culls on Experts to De-
cide if Workmanship of Gar
ment Is Perfect.
The courtroom of Justice of the
Peace Lawson was yesterday turned
into a miniature school of dressmak
ing during the trial of the suit of Miss
Nellie Davison against the New York
Clcak and Suit House and N. E.
Neary to recover $299 damages for
humiliation alleged to have been
sustained by her as the result of
harsh treatment by the agents and
employes of the defendants. The evi
dence disclosed that Miss Davison or
dered a dress of the concern and de
posited $10 thereon. When the dress
\v;is finished the plaintiff asserted that
it d'd not fit her and she refused to
take it. Then it was that Miss Davi
son says she was rudely shocked, that
the language and gestures of the de
fendants frightened her,* and she suf
fered great humiliation when they
threatened to throw her out of the
store. Five witnesses testified that it
was IflSfl Davison who used the loud
language^ despite the fact that every
thing was done to satisfy her. They
also claimed that the dress was a per
fect fit. W. J. Heckard said he ac
companied the lady when the dress
was turned over to her and he testi
fied that the dress was a bad fit.
When asked if he was competent to
judge of the fit of a dress Heckard
replied, blandly:
"I should say I am; you see, I am
a married man."
Both sides agreed to let Judge
Lav.son decide as to the fit. but he,
with a wisdom born of the expe
rience of his colleagues in somewhat
similar dilemmas, firmly refused. In
stead Lawson called in two expert
dressmakers, who proceeded to Inves
tigate the fit of the dress, In which
Miss Davison arrayed herself for the
occasion in the afternoon. After
much surveying the experts said they
would file a report in a day or two,
and Lawson postpVmed his decision
until then.

BOLD ATTEMPT TO ROB
AT HALL OF JUSTICE
Man Bumps Against Assistant Bond
and Warrant Clerk Flood and
Makes Grab for Gold.
A bold attempt to rob Bernard J.
Flood, assistant bond and warrant
1 ierk, was made in front of the Hall
cf Justice about 9 o'clock yesterday
morning. No policeman was in sight
at the time and the man made his es
cape down Washington street. Flood
says he will be able to recognize him
again.
A good deal of silver had accumu
lated for bail money for prisoners dur
ing the night, and not caring to carry
it to the Treasurer's office. Flood w^nt
to a store near the hall and changed
the silver into gold. He carried the
gold in his open hand while returning
to the hall. As he aproached the en
trance a powerful man bumped
against him and made a downward
stroke with his hand at Flood's open
hand containing* the gold coin. Flood
o.uickly closed his hand and struck
the would-be robber a smashing blow
on the face with his other hand. Be
fore he could repeat the blow the man
fled and disappeared down Washing
ton street. The man's intention was
evidently to scatter the coin and pick
up as much as he could and run.
Object to Transfer of Classes.
The Supervisors' Educational Com
mittee yesterday heard the protests of
the West of Castro Club and 209 res
idents against the action of the Board
of Education which resulted in th?
transfer of the primary grades of the
James Lick Grammar School to the
Noe Valley School and the moving of
thegrammar classes in the latter la
the former school owing to the trou
ble between Principal Lyser and the
teachers under him.
The gist of the protests was that the
change caused small children to travel
an unnecessary distance.

THE YOSEMITE RE-CESSION.
THE bill to re-cede the Yosemite Valley to the Federal Govern
ment has passed the House at Sacramento, by a vote of about
two to one. We use the terms "re-cession" and "re-cede," be
circumstances have made them descriptive. In its legal as
the proposition is that a trustee asks a trustor to terminate
i?t. A proposition has been introduced in the Senate for an
iment to the constitution, conferring upon the Legislature the
rto abandon this trust. It is stated that this amendment is for
the purpose of letting the people vote upon the re-cession. We in
tend no disrespect to any one in saying that it seems more like an
evasion of the issue.
The act of Congress granting to the State the administration of
the valley passed June 30. 1864. The grant was made "upon the
express condition that the premises shall be held for public use, resort
and recreation."' Governor Low accepted the grant by proclamation
September 28, 1864, and appointed Commissioners to take charge of
the valley and Mariposa grove, which was included in the grant.
Two years later the Legislature passed an act of acceptance and
by law provided a commission with a style and title, and in the act
said, "and by such name they and their successors may sue and be
sued, and shall have full power to manage and administer the grant
made and the trust created by said act of Congress."
This recognized the trust and put it in the legal catalogue of
B, which may terminate at any time by agreement of the trustor
and trustee. It was also an acknowledgment that the State does not
own the valley by title in fee, but is merely a trustee to manage
property belonging to the Federal Government, within the terms
and limitations of the trust.
Almost immediately upon assuming this managerial trust trouble
began which was the means of further intrenching the trust feature
of the transaction. J. M. Hutchings and J. C. Lamon claimed pri
vate ownership on the floor of the valley under pre-emption rights.
There was never any legality in this claim, because there could be no
pre-emption on the unsurveyed public domain. The Legislature,
however, recognized the claims by an act which was vetoed by the
Governor, and passed over his veto. It provided that the Surveyor
(General should survey the amount of land claimed by Hutchings and
Lamon in such shape as they desired. Though this act failed of
proper authentication after it passed over the veto, the Surveyor
< General was ordered to make the survey. Hutchings had his land
laid out in the form of a cross, of which the short arms reached from
wall to wall of the valley, completely blocking it.
Lamon had his laid off in detached lots commanding springs
and meadows. This act was interpreted to be a grant by the trustee
of the land to private ownership, and it was assumed that Congress,
acting for the trnstor. would have to sanction it. Out of this and
other matters grew litigation which was carried by Hutchings by
writ of error from the Supreme Court of the State to that of the
L'nited States. Both courts held against him and defined the legal
>tatu<s of the State to be that of trustee for the management bf the
vail-
Further back than this is much interesting history. It became
xhc practice of visitors to the valley to post notices of claims to land
between its walls. Even before the ambitious 9cheme of Hutchings,
these claims were all joined and traded to a liquor seller in the
tains, who put the whole valley up at a raffle for one dollar a
ticket.
he decision of the State and Federal courts the character
-t was understood to be managerial only. Its acceptance
not referred to a popular vote. Therefore its return to the
â¢r does not require that formality. Nor is there any analogy
between the return of this trust and the giving away of the capital,
a- ha^ been suggested during the debate in the Legislature. The
never belonged to the State, and the only question at is
>w is, I e the trustor better able to administer its property than
the trustee?
What are some of the facts of the present management? The
Commissioners who manage this trust have put a tax of fifty
a head on all the visitors who go into the valley in a stage!
This is not only rank discrimination against those who cannot afford
a private team, but is a violation of the conditions of the trust. The
only income from the trust itself as expressly stated in the act of
Congress i? from' leases of privileges for profit, to parties in the val-
For the State itself to tax visitors is in clear violation of its
The foregoing exposition of the legal status of this trust is
ample answer to all of the sentimental objections to giving up the
valley as the property of the State. It is and always has been the
property of the United States. It is. inclosed by a national park, also
the property of the United States. The proposition is simply to re
from the State's managerial trust and let the United States
manage its whole property in the park and the valley. Then it is
probable that a fine of fifty cents a head will not be put upon stage
passengers for visiting the valley.
THE LADY AND THE SCHOOLS.
THE city campaign in Oakland presents some interesting fea
tures. For some years past the School Board of that city, which
elective, has had a woman member, Dr. Myra Knox. It is in
such evidence as popular esteem furnishes, and there is none better,
she iei c n<~Â»t only a skillful and successful physician, but is a citi
zen of public spirit and a woman of affairs, a useful member of the
politic, and a? a School Director has proved the value of such
an individuality in that capacity.
Most of the teachers are women, and a large percentage of the
pupil* are growing girls, and in the nature of things a sensible
woman and physician combined, willing to serve the city without
compensation, is valued highly by the thoughtful and careful parents
of pupils. Sometimes Mrs. Knox has been nominated by one party
convention, sometimes by another, and sometimes by none. She has
abstained from all effort to get her name on any ticket, but it gets
there and the people elect her. This time the Republican convention
at first left her off and there is some donbt about the attitude of the
Municipal League. The duty of responding to public sentiment has
been responded to by the Union Labor party, which has shown ex
ceeding good sense by putting her on its ticket, and was followed by
the Democratic convention.
The members of the Labor part}- are peculiarly dependent upon
the public schools for the education of their children, and the ex
perience of the city for years with Mrs. Knox on the School Board
has proved her to be a necessary factor in the right administration of
ihe schools. Not being a politician and not seeking even this office,
which has duty and responsibility for its sole emoluments, she has
no political debts to pay, and is independent and untrammeled. The
Call looks upon the situation with more interest than is in its news
feature.
It has an ethical side. The position of Mrs. Knox as a citizen
and a non-elector, yet elected time and again on her merit, is the ideal
position for a School Director, who should have no political debts to
pay to anybody. The value of such an example is too great to be
lost. All school boards should be made up of such individuals, men
and women, dutiful and impressed by the great responsibility they
have for the moral and physical character of the coming generation
of citizens. The outcome of the matter in Oakland will be the most
interesting feature of the city election.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 8. 1905.
THEIR SCARLET THREAD
IN bis heart of hearts the handsome
young principal of the High School
sometimes characterized the young
people under his charge in highly
unprofessional language, as "little
beasts." Teaching was by no means
his vocation, but Bimply a compulsory
grace by which he hoped to obtain two
coveted years of study at Heidelberg.
He did so now with a viciousness
that would have horrified their parents,
for as he and Miss Comyng entered
one of the smaller recitation rooms to
look at a globe they were confronted
by their own names, scrawled upon
the blackboard and bristling with the
canceled letters common to both. By
counting first the canceled and then
the remaining letters to the formula
"Friendship, love, indifference, hate,"
the youthful tormentors had discov
eredâand duly published to the world
âthat Miss Comyng's feeling for him
was a compound of friendship and in
difference, while his own for her was
unadulterated love.
But this was not all. Lest the in
scription should by any means escape
the attention of its objects, warnlngly
scrawled beneath it was the admoni
tion: "Change the name and not the
letter, and you change for worse and
not for better."
Cartright glanced at his companion
swiftly. He devoutly hoped she was
not one of those mawkishly senti
mental young women who blushed and
quivered at occurrences of this sort,
thereby giving him an uncomfortable
feeling that possibilities hovered in her
mind.
But this time he need have had no
fear. Miss Comyng took the matter
much more coolly than her predeces
sor had done under similar circum
stances. She faced the scrawl a mo
ment with puckering brows, then
transferred her gaze openly to his
face and laughed outright at the dawn
ing look of relief she surprised there
and when she spoke it was with a
great demureness.
"I don't feel a bit embarrassed," ehe
remarked. "No one, I'm sure, need
feel ashamed of feeling 'friendship and
indifference" for a colleague. But can
didly"âher tone changed and became
frank and matter-of-factâ "isn't It
amazing that in all those young heads
from which the pig-tails are still dang
linp. as well as the clipped and
rumpled ones on the other side of the
room, the romantic idea should be
dominant? You and I, being neither
very old nor very ugly"â her lips
twitchedâ "will play the leading roles
in a living drama for the next few
months. One hundred and twenty
pairs of keen eyes will be watching
us daily, awaiting some sign of our ad
miration for each other. It'sâ lt's
simply appalling!"
"Appalling!" he echoed. "I should
say it was â and pome of them are still
in the stage where they spell future
with a 'eh' and busy with an T! But
I don't mind if you don't," he added
magnanimously.
She was sitting on the arm of one
of the chairs in a thoroughly girlish
hut rather undignified attitude. Cart
right noticed with satisfaction that her
teaching had not "sunk in" as yet.
"Mind! Not I. Why, it's as good
as a play. Now, if you come Into my
room to speak to me during a recita
tion, especially if you should happen
to smile at me, the air becomes elec
tric with meaning. Minnie telegraphs
Jennie a swift 'Did you see that?' and
even the h*ilking, overgrown boys who
have been sitting like bumps upon

GROWING OLD.
The change in this matter of grow
ing old, since the time when the lady
of 3 8 felt herself too ancient to wear
a flower in her cap, is interesting. It
is especially interesting at that
dreadful moment when we first realize
that we are ourselves no longer young.
It is an extraordinary moment; pain,
denial, rebellion, hopelessness. It ar
rives in many different ways. It used
to come with spectacles â but nowa
days the babe wears spectacles;
it creeps upon us with a little stiffen
ing of the joints; one does not run
upstairs as lightly as one did. It may
even reveal itself In the impatience
that is felt because people do not
speak quite as distinctly as they
should â an impatience to which the
younger generation rudely refers as
deafness. These are gradual intima
tions that we are not so young as we
were. There are abrupt ones â es
pecially there is the glance into the
mirror some morning after a sleep
less night. Probably every woman
over 4 5 has known the start of aston
ishment and dismay that comes with
that glance â a creased and tired com
plexion, dull eyes, wrinkled throat;
well! these symptoms need not be
catalogued, they are too unpleasant
The woman who had this slight shock
before breakfact glances at her
looking-glass many times that day,
and always with a growing comfort,
for as the day passes things change;
her face is more alert; her eyes
brighten, her double chin is, some
how, firmer. No; It was only fa
tigue from a bad night; not age, oh,
no! â Margaret Deland, In Harper* â 
Bazar.
PIANOS CATCH COLDS.
"In this wintry weather," said the
tuner, "keep your piano in a warm,
dry room and see. besides, that its
cover is a good, thick, comfortable
one. Otherwise It will take cold. Its
tone will become hoarse and squeaky.
"3-?riously," the tuner continued, "a
piano's voice is affected by cold
weather and dampness much as is the
human voice. It gets altogether out
of tune. Considerable treatment Is re
quired to put it in good shape again.
"Hence, the piano should be kept
in a room of equable temperature. It
should be placed against the inside
wall, away from drafts. It should be
kept closed when not in use. Its
cover in the winter should be of felt,
thick, toft and warm."

she remarked slowly, and from the
bag at her side she took a slip of
paper and held it out to him. "It's
extremely flattering to you, anyway."
He looked at the slip. "I bet she's
in love with him," was written in a
wobbling, unformed hand. "I don't
see how she can help It, he has such
fearful fires in his dark eyes. They're
just like Rochester's."
There was a moment's silence, and
then the two young instructors broke

him," was written.
into a roar of laughter that wiped out
the last sense of strangeness beween
them.
"Now that you know that I know,
and I know that you know," was Cart
right's somewhat involved explana
tion, "I don't see any reason why we
can't be friends. Nothing that those
young cubs do can poÃsibly make us
shy. We'll show them that the thread
of romance doesn't run through every
friendship between a man and a
woman."
"As the scarlet thread through
every bit of rope used by the British
navy," she supplemented saucily, and
then the talk reverted to school mat
ters.

School were not slow to discover that
there was a new ease and understand

algebra and physiology and the prin

droppci (Iffjiinily Into (lie words of
her latest novel. "And words of love
fell from his lips."
"But how do you know â you didn't
hear them, did you." demanded the
practical and unimaginative. Minnie.
"Hear them!" was Jennie's scornful
retort. "There are some things you
don't have to hear to know them. I'll
bet you that he was proposing to her.
Just wait â and watch the third linger j
of her left hand."
But though they waited and !
watched with a patience that deserved j
reward, the tapering fingers of Ruth
Comyng's left hand remained un- â 
adorned. Had they shown any sign
of a misunderstanding all might have
been forgiven; but, on the contrary,
they were apparently the best of
friends, and Minnie Brown formed a
mean habit, twitting Jennie like this:
"Yes, that will happen just about the
time that ring appears on Miss Com
yng's left hand!'' And poor Jennie
was forced to listen in silence, for had
she not asserted positively that words
of love were falling from his lips?
She was conscious of a fearful disap
pointment with life, and she watched
thia unaccountable hero and heroine ;
with bitter, resentful eyes.
Meantime the school .year drew to- â 
ward its close and Cartright, with a !
dancing heart, saw his dream of two
years at Heidelberg about to mater
ialize into a real experience.
"Think of it," he said to Miss
Comyng as they rowed upon the little !
lake in the park one dusky spring
evening, "after June 15 I'm free. Then
ho, for the Vaterland! No more re- :
fractory boys, no more pert, half
fledged girls, no more tinkling of bells,
no more wasting of life and energy
on a life I'm utterly unfit for â no ,
more chalk, no more Latin â "
He paused abruptly as if some un
expected thought had arrested him .
and, trailing his oars, he looked curi- ;
ously at her. She, too, appeared ab- I
stracted, but she aroused herself and I
smiled, "Well?"
"I've had an awful thought," he re
sumed soberly. "It never occurred to
me until this moment, but don't you 1
see â there'll be no more you. either.
And I've got so â so accustomed to
you, you know!"
His face showed a puzzled amaze
ment that this should be so; and the !
girl opposite, seeing it, smiled invol- '
untarily. She, too, was a trifle bewil
dered at a certain quick constriction
of the heart that his talk about going
abroad had given her. They had been â 
the very best of friends and compan
ions, but was that any reason why she
should feel a quick, overwhelming
sense of desolation at the mere men
tion of his going away?
Cartright rowed on absently â me
chanically. Then, as the dusk melted
softly into darkness, he made for the
shore. The girl opposite him was a
mere blurred shadow. The boat poked
its nose into the shore and he jumped
out. The action seemed to shake off
the benumbing amazement that had
fallen upon him and in its place came
a great, glad certainty.
He held out his hand â two hands,
in fact â to help Miss Comyng ashore,
and as she put hers into them he
murmured: "My dear, mv dear â it's
the scarlet thread after all!"

HOW TO WIN
WOMAN'S LOVE
JOHANN HOCH
Aphorisms Evolved From
the Bigamist's Experience
With Forty-Four Wives
VETEBAX WOOER'S TIPS
Nine Out of Ten of the
Fair Sex, He Says, Can
Be Snared by Flattery
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. '.â Johann Hoch,
the arch bigamist, In his talks with a
police sergeant, confided to him the
following aphorisn<s and rules, evolved
from his experience with forty-four
women whom he married, swindled and
deserted:
"Nine out of every ten women can be
won by flattery.
"Never let a woman know her own
shortcomings.
"Always appear to the woman to be
the anxious one.
"Women like to be told pleasant
things about themselves.
"When you make love be ardent and
earnest.
"The average man can fool the aver
age woman if he will only let her have
her own way at the start."
Among the numerous women now
coming forward In the vicinity of New
York claiming that a man answering
Johann Hoch's description married
them several years ago is Mrs. Wil
helmina Rummler of Carlstadt, N. J.
She has not yet seen the prisoner, but
has examined his pictures. Mrs.
Rummler claims to have lost $6000 in
ht^r matrimonial venture and Is now
almost penniless. Said she:
On May 27, 1903, I had a prosperous florist's
business in Wot Nyack, N. Y. A man applied
to me for a job ac foreman. He gave his
name as Johann C. O. Schultze and said he
came from Chicago. His manner of talking
charmed me. and at last he proposed and I
decided to become his wife. Twenty minutes
after the ceremony my husband asked me if
I bad any money. I told him that I had
$6000 and* within tha next week he had drawn
it and told me that he had just $6000 more
and that he was going to put the $12,000 In a
safe Investment. He spoke so nicely and
kissed me Â«o often that 1 believed him. Bvery
day he would go to the postofflce himself and
return with dozens of letters. He never al
lowed me to read any of them. On December
22, 1903 Bchultze disappeared. I heard later
that he had been seen In Cincinnati and
threatened to kill me If I did not keep silent.
Since that day I have sever spoken of him.
That mart stole every penny I owned In the
world and I mi left alone with mjr three
children to make my living . .
CHICAGO, Feb. 7.â A variation in
the experience of Johann Hoch's al
leged wives was related by Mrs. Amelia
Kauke Hoch of Elgin, 111. She says
she married Hcch at Aurora, 111., two
years ago. Shortly after the marriage
she became violently ill after taking
some white powders administered by
her husband. A physician gave her
an emetic and, she believes, saved her
life. A small portion of the powder
was given to a cat. The cat died quick
ly. Louis Kauke, the woman's father,
identified Hoch's picture.
GERMANY MAKES NO PROTEST
AGAINST SPEECH OF LEE
Quick Denials From London Bettered

BERLIN. Feb. 7.â The Foreigm Of
fice says Germany has not protested
to the British Foreign Office on the
subject of the speech made by Civil
lx>rd of the Admiralty Lee at East
leigh on February 4, In which he de
clared that Great Britain had not so
much as kept her eyes on France and
the Mediterranean, but she had to
look with anxiety, though not with
fear, toward the North Sea. Possibly
the quick denials which reached Ber

TO SAVE WOMAN
FROM GALLOWS
Thousands Join in Petitions
in Behalf of Mrs. Edwards,
Pennsylvania Murderess
COXDE^IKED TO DEATH
Efforts Being Made to Hare
state Board of Pardons
Commute Her Sentence
HARRISBURGK Pa., Feb. 1. â So nu
merous have been the requests from
all over the country from people who
want Governor Pennypacker to com
mute to life imprisonment the sentence
of Mrs. Kate Kd wards, who is to be
hanged at Reading on February 16,
that It has been found necessary for
the executive department to prepare a
circular letter in answer to these re
quests. This letter quotes the State
constitution to show that the Governor
has no power to commute a death
sentence to life Imprisonment, except
upon the recommendation in writing
of the Board of Pardons.
READING, Pa., Feb. 7.â Letttn from
all parts of the country continue to
pour in upon Oliver Lentz, attorney
for Mrs. Kate Edwards. In each case
the writer thinks that It would be an
outrage to hang her. A number of rea
sons are given for this belief, the prin
cipal ones being that Ehe is a woman
and that the state she was in at the
time the crime was committed was
caused, in part at least, by the oonduct
of her huÃband.
Many of the letters are strong ap
peals, and the writers offer to circulate
petitions to be sent to the Board of
Pardons. It is estimated that at the
meeting of the latter next week peti
tions signed by 50,000 people will be
presented asking for mercy for the
woman. The press department of the
W. C. T. U. announces that It is try
ing to bring about concentrated action
on the part of the entire association in
the matter and that it will use every
effort in its power to save the con
demned woman from the fate that
overshadows her.
Attorney Lentz mailed to-day to the
Board of Pardons at Harrlsburg the
petition to have the sentence of Mrs.
Edwards commuted. He will call on
Governor Pennypacker to-morrow In
an endeavor to get a reprieve, and
John H. Rothermel, counsel for Sam
uel Greaser, her negro accomplice, will
go to Harrisburg on a similar mission
on Thursday.
Rev. Stephen Schweitier of Ephrata,
Pa., Mrs. Edwards' spiritual adviser,
to whose congregation she formerly
belonged, is circulating petitions among
the people of her old home. There has
not been one refusal. In the meantime
Mrs. Edwards is, with her prison-born
daughter. Alma, in her cell.

ONE LONE FAVORITE CATCHES JUDGES' EYES AT OAKLAND RACE TRACK
SAIS, WITH ALARIE UP,
UNPLACED IN HANDICAP
Bell Reed Is the Only Successful Favorite at Oakland
Arcade Defeated
by Hainault in
a Drive.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
Although Bell Reed is only a cheap
selling-plater it must be conceded he is
a consistent performer, far more so
than many of the so-called handicap
horses. The major portion of this lat
ter class are In and out. like waiters
passing through a kitchen door.
It so happened that Bell was
the only successful public choice at
Oakland yesterday, the balance all
g down for the count. The track
vas= still in a heavy condition, and this
served to Etill further complicate
things.
Even Sai*. the ready money article
from the Blute stable, departed from
th*> (straight and narrow path in the
irloog handicap. The brown
â  carried 11" pounds and Alarie, the
discovered star by the press
nomere. Racked down to 9 to 10.
U :i? shy of sp^ed as a collar but
ton vender If of clear notes, finishing
fourth.
KVAFF EIIM BRAGG A WINNER.
Bragp. fresh from Ascot Park and
excellently -handled by "Big Bill"
Knapp. earned the decision over Rector
in a driving finish. The show went to
pea Voyage, an eighty-nine pounder.
Bell Heed ruled an odds-on favorite
for the introductory sprint and with
Jakie Jones in the saddle won with
considerable in reserve. Ethel Abbott,
a 50 to 1 shot, made her first appear
ance this season and beat The Ha
ivaiian half a dozen lengths for the
place.
Mazapan. a filly hy Solitaire-Sweet
Cakes, starting with the colors of.
Napa Stock Farm up. downed I big
field for the two-year-old scramble.
Bonner had the leg up and getting
away second, quickly showed in front
and was never headed. Semilune fin
ished second, five lengths ahead of
Lady Catherine. â¢
Georjre A. Knight, the actual favor
ite which started coupled with Caz
zaza, ran fourth. I^orena M ran a nice
race after getting away poorly.
From the manner in which the coin
poured into the books on Fair Lady
Anna it looked Just a question of how
far the mare would win. From I the
price was hurriedly swiped to 9 to 10
and even lower at the last. Bonner
pot the pood thing away well, once
Fliowed first, then she flickered and
v. enf out completely.
TOTO GRATIOT FINISHES FIRST.
The winner turned up in Toto Gra
; iot, a 16 to 1 outsider, piloted by Bell.
Grandpa closed strongly, losing
mX a length only. Ragnarok at
] I >k the show.
It must have been that old Barrack
had |iot recovered from his race in the
- aiurday, for he disap
â  d sadly in the mile and a six
ling fixture. The veteran's
were forced down from a to 5 to
10. He ran an indifferent third.
Ar.vii. a well-backed 6 to 1 shot, made
he running and in a drive led
nnatus over the line nearly a
length. Briers came out rheumatic
and gouty, running back among the
â¢also ranf."
There were but four starters in the
concluding mile selling run, Elliott,
o-sving to lameness, being an absentee.
With the Daly horse out of the way,
Arcade had first call in the betting.
Alarie, who had the mount, rode a
v Judged race and Hainault, the
*^cond choice, carried off the purse.
Jakie J^ne?, who rode the winner, cot
: her three starters off at the first
turn, after which he enjoyed clear sail-
Ing. In the Ft retch Alarie picked the
deepest going for the favorite and
while it looked as if Hainault was
beaten at the paddock Arcade found
ered about the same time. Stilicho se
cured the show. Major Tenny cutting
little figure In the race.

Aqueduct Dates for Morris Park.
NEW YORK. Feb. 7.â Trouble in ar
ranging dates for the local race tracks
this season owing to the completion of
the New Belmont Park course on Long
Island and the decision of those con
trolling Morris Park to continue the
sport another year has resulted in a
deal which. will close Aqueduct track
at least for the summer. The sale of
the latter has not yet been concluded,
but probably will be in a few days,
for a sum in the neighborhood of
U.'.0.000. The racing dates thus made
open will be given to Morris Park.
Those controlling the older tracks on
Long Island absolutely refused to sur
render any of their time and the pur
chase of Aaueduct was the only
course open in order to preserve the
equal order of events interrupted by
tho unexpected decision of the club
controlling Morris Park.

tion. The members will not have their
hotel bills and other expenses paid.
Neither will they be under high salary.
Jockeys will be compelled to pay $25
for licenses and trainers between $5
and $10. The rules of racing will be
similar to those of the Western Jockey
Club.

of his work. He has a different point
of view now and wants to bring out
the best he has In him. HÂ« has been
training for weeks over In Marln
County for health, but from this time
forth he will be building up bis won
derful fighting machinery.

Mainland Market
Tempts Island
Breeders.
MANY ASIATICS
178 Japanese in
â¢ the Liner's
Steerage.
WYOMING SAILS
The cargo or the liner Alameda,
*hirh arrived yesterday from Hono
lulu, included Â£Â«'.OO ltve frogs. Frogs for
home consumption have been bred in
the Hawaiian Islands for some years,
but this is the first time that any seri
ous effort has been made to Invade the
mainland market. George Landon,
who accompanied the amphibious ani
mals on their lons journey, declares
that the Hawaiian frog ponds are of
vast extent, and if the transportation
difficulties can be overcome he expects
to see Hawaiian frogs living the meat
trust more concern than Lawson is
causing the copper kings of Wall
street.
Hawaiian frogs acquire great size
and are said t<Â» be of unusually deli
cate flavor. The canned pineapple in
dustry, recently born in the Hawaiian
Islands, is growing rapidly and prom
ises to become a valuable factor in the
Territory's commercial growth. It was
'he sueews on the mainland markets
of the pineapple venture which in
duced the live frog: people to expand
their business. If the frogs yin favor
the island Territory has other dainties
of tropical growth which will be added
to the Hawaiian export list.
Amoi c the Alajneda*s passengers
â¢was Colonel CJeorge French of the Sal
vation Army, who has been making
a -tour of the Hawaiian popts. In ad
dition to Colonei French. Miss Grace
Powers and 11. Severs were the only
cabin pass*-ngi?rs who came up on th-i
liner. In the steerage, ever, were
more than 200 passengers, of whom
ITS wer Japanese. The Alameda
brought 1750 tyns cf cargo, which in
cluded 15.01S eacks of sugar, 5207
bunches of bananas, rice, pineapples,
coffee, froge and Hawaiian silver val
ued at $20,000. sent here to be recoined
Into American money.
Captain Dowdell reports having en
countered four days of very heavy
â weather. In spite of head winds and
high seas, however, the Alameda was
only 6 days and 4 hours on the way,
and all her passengers were ashore
soon after 2 o'clock yesterday after
noon.
Bay Pirates Captured.
John Scores, alias "Dutchy the Grab," and
Edward Daly were arrested yesterday n<ar
the Pacific Mall wharf by Policemen McGowan
end Ccniar; and will be charged with burglary.
Scores is a praduate water frcnt rat and is
fa id to b* the boldest of all the bay pirates.
He is crtditrd In police circles with irreat ver
satility, a menace to i>roi>erty afloat and a
bat: man for unarmed citizens to encounter
tt nisht. Scores ani Dal>- are said to bÂ«
rnrrabrrs of the pirate band whose lair was
disÂ»-ovÂ«fred last wÂ«k on an abandoned whaling
l>erk off the P^cirtc Mail wharf. Th<Â»re are
oilier riraits still breathing th" air of freedom
and fcr tl.era the police are hurting. Hopps,

North Submits Papers to
Show That He Did Not
Assist Lee Toy's Case by
Deporting Six Witnesses
ADVISED BY DUNN
AS TO THE FACTS
Commissioner Neglects to
Inform District Attorney
That Evidence Was Here
in Time for Use in Court
United States Immigrant Commis
sioner North submitted to the inspec
tion of the press y-esterday certain
letters and telegrams and copies of
others bearing upon the case of the
six Chinese women whom he deported
to China last November, after he had
been informed by Inspector James R.
Dunn at St. Louis that the women, in
.their confessions, had implicated Lee
Toy and others then awaiting trial in
this city upon an indictment charging
them with having attempted to import
Chinese women for an immoral pur
pose.
The papers show that the women left
this city by the steamship Coptic on
November 26, 1904. A letter written by
Inspector Dunn to North dated at St.
Louis on November 19, was received and
stamped by North on November 23. It
contains the following important para
graph:
I transmit herewith transcripts of the sworn
confessions of those women above mentioned.
In which will be found very frank admissions
that they were Immoral women In China and
were brought to this country for immoral
purposes. I think it will be found that these
also implicate Lee Toy and perhaps others.
WOODWORTH XOT NOTIFIED.
Three, days after the receipt of this
letter by North these six . witnesses,
whom Mr. Dunn believed could testify
against Lee Toy, were shipped to
China from this port. United States
District Attorney Wood worth says he
was not Informed of the matter until
December 5. nine days after the women
had left. On December 5 North sent
to Woodworth's office "the six tran
scripts of the confessions of the
women, ' whereupon on the same date
Woodworth wrote to North. as follows:
You have Just sent me what purports to be
confessions of six Chinese women. Your mes
senger stated that these six Chinese women
Imd already been sent to China. â¢ He then
corrected himself and stated that they were
still here in San Francisco. I desire to be
informed whether these six Chinese persona
are still In your custody in San Francisco,
i and if they are not and if deported for China
; the date and the steamer by which they were
; sent to China, and I also desire to know by
i whose order they wÂ»"> sent. " If these women
1 were sent to China I fail to see how the eon
! fesslons of these women ' sent to me at this
) late date can be of any service in the prosecu
tion now pending in this oflWa against Lee
: Toy. H. Eca da SHva and others.
NORTH CALLS TO THF OCEAN.
! To this letter North replied on the
. same day, December b.
| These ' concessions" were received by me this
Â« day from the , Chinese Inspector In charge at
j St. Louis^ as iÂ»rt of a letter which was also
transmitted . to* you. The Chinese women in
question were deported from this port , for
â  China by the steamship Coptic on the 2Cth
â  ultimo by order of the department. If there
! is anything :in these confessions which you
desire to produce as evidence in the prcsecu-
J tiens now pendins in your hands against Lee
, Toy et al. I presume these people can be
i stopped and sent back. If you will advise
I me of your wishes I will take up the matter
â¢ with the department.
f On the next day, December 6, North
wired the following to the Commis
, sloner General at "Washington:
j Received yesterday Inspector Dunn's St.
I Louis confessions six Chinese women deported
1 this port 26th ultimo. Referred same to Unit
, ed States Attorney, who says testimony said
! wemen very valuable in case against Lee Toy
let al. He r"<iuests said , women be returned
; United States if possible.
lARXKH SI.FKPS VINE DAYS.
North says that the department
did not reply to this telegram, and on
December 15, nine days later, he re
peated the message. On December 16
he received * the following telegram
from F. H. Lamed, Acting Commis
sioner General:
Complete report Inspector Dunn regarding
transcripts of testimony .Chinese women mailed
you Uth. Women cannot be brought back.
L*tt<>r of Chinese Minister mailed to-day.
"That's the last I heard of the mat
ter," said Mr. North, "until - yester
day, when I read the article -in The
Call."
As showing that the department did
not suggest the detention of the six
women on their arrival here from St.
Louis, the following telegram from L.
O. Murray, acting secretary, dated
November 17, was produced :
Inspector Dunn directed the delivery your
port Ho Hunjr Loo Ngung, Ho ' Sun. Won
Feng, - Ngun Yuk. Chang , Gin Tai and Kg
Mow San. Chinese women arrested on depart
ment â¢ warrant and found to have entered
United States In violation law. You are In
structed to deport them at expense owners
steamship Doric, via which they arrived Au
gust 6 last. For so doing this sufficient war
rant. â  'â¢"â â â 
COM I.SSIONS SPIRITED AWAY.
The mysterious 'part of; the whole
affair is the disappearance of the con
fessions, which Dunn supposed he had
mailed to North : in the letter of trans
mission of the date November 19 and
received here November ', 23. On the
latter date North informed Dunn that
the confessions had not arrived in that
letter.
::. Depositions of H. A. S.-Persch, Miss
Madeline Lissak and E. L. Kimmel.
employes 1 : of North, are to the effect
that Dunn's letter of transmission did
not contain the confessions. Dunn in
reply to North's letter of November
23. says:
. I beg to assure you that the transcripts of
the confessions , of the Fix Chinese women
were :â  duly, prepared tor;: fending â  In my said
letter and my messenger Insists that they had
been : sent. Apparently they > have disappeared
or been missed. I â  herewith =eend : ; you dupli
cate 'of said confessions - for such use as your
office may desire to make of them. -
.-- To this letter ; North' replied on De
cember 6 \ that the * original â¢ confessions
had never been received.
United States ; District Attorney
Wood worth said yesterday: â¢
'â 'Â I felt It to be my duty to lay the facts be
fore . the â¢ Department :. of Justice. â¢ Mr. North
never mentioned. to me ' until December 5 that
any confessions had been made until; nine days

The \\ oatlier and Crops.
Hm weekly report of a. G. McA^ie. asetloa
director of the climate and crop sen-ice of
the Weather Bureau, is as follows:
GENERAL ECMMABT.
Abnormally warm weather prevailed in all
pcrts of the State during the week and heavy
rain ielV in ail sections nearly every day.
Trun<it; occurred in Southern California,
â¢ccompaniefl by copious rainfall, and heavy
â¢now tell in all the mountain district*. Rivers
and creeks overflowed their banks in the north
and ecuth, causing washouts on the railroad
lines and considerable damage to other prop
â¦rt> Lightning destroyed a church building
at Pasadena on the 3d.
The soil is too wet far cultivation in nearly
eJI fÂ«ections and but little farm work was Oone
*urinÂ»t the week. Grain is in good condition
in most places and has made excellent growth
in the southern districts, but the continued
rains have been eomewha un.'av. rabie in the
northern section and there are some reports of
the gTain turning yellow in places. On the
whole prospects erÂ«- never better at this sta
â¢ â "11 for large crops of wheat, oats and barley in.
aii parts of the State. Aifal'a is making rapid
growth and looks well. Green feÂ»d is plentiful
and of exceilent quality, and Esack is in thÂ«
very best condition. Early vegetables are
doing well.
The warm weather and rainÂ» hayÂ« been
rtther unfavorable for oranges in Southern
California, and shipments have been light.
The season thus far has been the best for
many years for deciduous fruit* and grapes,
owing to the heavy and well-distributed rains
which have thoroughly t>at.urate<l the soil.
Deciduous fruils have commenced budding in
rr.cny claces.
SACRAMENTO VALLEY.â Rain fell nearly
pvej-y day durimg the week and the weather
wps unusually warm for the season. The con
tinuous heavy rainfall has caused a suspen
sion of all farm work and is regarded as- un
favorable for grain, which ln some ptevcea has
commenced turning yellow. Most of the early
train, however, is still .n eood condition and
with fair, cooler weather will probably make
rapid improvement. Tb* acreage In grain is
laiger than usual and will be increased as
coon as the soil is in working condition.
Green iced is abundant and stock ie in ex
o-Uent condition. Tbe warm weatiier may
prcve unfavorable â  ror deciduous fruitSt in
causing- premature budding, but a well-known
authority among horticulturists regards the
e'-ascn ac remarkably favorable for fruit grow
-"Jers.
COAST AND BAT OODimjDÃ.â Warm j
weather continued during the week and ,44gnt ,
to heavy rain fell in all sections nearly every '
day. The soil is so completely saturated that j
a.l! farming operations nave been suspended ex
cept in portions of the Â«w>utherr district*.
â¢ Jraln is reported in .excellent condition and
is making irood growth. In the vicinity- of
Â«san Ltsis Oblspo grain planted before the rains
!has made a growth of six inches. Prospects
for large crops of wheat, oats and barley were
never better Borne damage has been done to
croj.B by the overflow of streams in the north
ern district?. Pasturage I* plentiful in all
fpctione and stock is n good condition. De
ciduous fruit trees have commenced budding.
Pruning is ii progress in come places.
â¢SAX JOAQUIN VALLEY. â Warm, cloudy
weather, with frequent rains, prevailed during
the past â¢â  â¢-.- These conditions were very
beneficial to grain, grass, vines and orcharoc.
Grain has made rapid growth and is reported
in excellent condition. Green feed Is plentiful
and Etock is healthy and in good condition.
Pruning and cultivating Â» orchards and vine
yards are nearly completed in some sections
snd progressing as rapidly as the wet soii
*ill permit. . Fruit buds are swelling â¢â  seme
districts. Heavy shipments of hay continue
to Southern California, Heavy enow is re
ported in the Sierras.
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.â Heavy . rain
commenced Wednesday and continued most of
the week, with severe gtornn and heavy snow-
Jtdl in the mountain districts. Rivers over
flowed their tiankÂ«. causing great damage to
the railroads and other property. At Pasa
dena a church building was struck by . light
i;ing and burned to the ground- The Beasrnal
rainfall at Los Angeles is now 10.13 inches.
and i_ probably much greater in the foothills.
At Upland 10.34 inches had fallen up to Sat
urday. Warm weather has prevailed and grain
and grass aye made good growth. Crop pros
pect* were never better at this time of the
>Â»Â«r. Plowing, needing and tree pruning are
progressing. Green feed lc plentiful.
LOS ANGELES SUMMARY.- The storm be
ginning February I continues with generous
well-dlEtributed rain, heavy at times, with
ecrne damage, but the good far offsets the
harm. Ran will do much toward replenishing
the water supply depleted b?' a long period of
do' years.
EUREKA SUMMARY.â The weather during
the week was favorable for farm work. Grass
and grain continue to make rapid growth.
Prospects for abundant crops are excellent.
Boil on the bottom land le still too wet for

NEW YORK. Feb. 7.â There were mere
railroad etorko Included Jn the movement than
I.B* th* taw- y.f-terday, but the relative
prominence of the industrialf and specialties
nas etill ffreat. The railroad stocks, which
Â«erÂ» active and strong, were not of first-rate
importance in thc-ir representative capacity,
or in tt.^ proportions of th# market for them.
Many of tbe most conspicuous 1 . favorite* in
â¢h* market were sluggish and comparatively
neglected. csp<*cially after the orÂ«ening ad
vance, which was in sympathy with the Lon
don market. The strength abroad was at
tributed to rumor* of a..c negotiations,
which were of lees influmce h*re, bo that
ths higher price? for American mocks cent
from London, while they were well < lamed.
were not extended In the tut-* of the leader*.
Yesterday's rumor* of a comprehensive mer
gf-r of local traction s^ock* dropped into the
trfifkground to-day with the . natural result
of some realizing in those stocks. â  But one
of the notable features of the rotation of ruÂ»-'
mntÂ« wnlch have induced the upotty rise fn
price* !k the manner In which the advances
nre retained ' after the rumors have spent
tii^ir force. The inference suggested by this
action of the market lis tnat Urn rumors < f
deals arc- suggested by the movements in
stocks rather than b<Â»ing the eau*e of them.
V.'hile Uie stocks affected fall Into negiect
thry yield comparatively Bllghtly. As a con
sequence the average level of prices it con
stantly rising. To-<3ay it was at the highest
In many month*, although many stocks are â 
slightly below the maximum. SpeÂ«ific v Â« cases
of buying of individual ctooks - were lacking, :
tut It i." prsbsble that a large ec:ir>ra) ef- l
foct Â«as pro-iuced by the, report that the In
ter*latÂ«> end Fcr<*lgn Commerce Committee of
th* Senate of the Untied States was to *tt
during the eummwr r*scei<s to investigate thÂ»
raJlrrad rate question. Thia was a<ioptâ¬-<1 as ,
â¢ practical announcement that definitive leg
islation on this subject was to be . postponed
beyond 'he present session of Congress. TJie
advances In Southern iron stocks were ,iue.
to vague rumcrs of a project of a consoli
dation of Southern iron companies. The United
States Steel /stocks were almost immovable for
the greater part of the -ion. The special
strength of Norfolk & Western and cf Atchi
son in the railroad list was unaccounted for.
The cotton carriers were helped by the Cen
sus Bureau's final report of cotton . ginned up
to January 16. indicating a crop of close to
13.<XiO,oeo bales. The rates on export grain,
which werxi re-established after being cut, were
cut again. The enormous diversion of corn
traffic from the Atlantic ports to the gulf al
ready effected Is sufficient notice of the seri
ous character of this contest. The rates for
sterling exchange yielded to a slight extent,
but inquiries indicated that practically all of
the $5,0u0.0U0 in gold bars transferred to New
V .rk from the Philadelphia Mint would go
out on Thursla>. The realizing of profits
cost nly a slight portion of the advances and
the market closed steady at very little below
the best.

The feature of the- * Egg : market : was heavy
arrivals of store Eggs .from â¢ Hollister, Watson
vJHe and the - San Joaquin. the -recent r urgent
demand and premium for these goods having
called them Into market. Ranch Eggs were
also tn better supply and. though they weere
no lower, there was a general tendency to sell
them, even if concessions were necessary.
A curious feature of the Egg market at the
moment is the arrival o? 18 barrels from
Shanghai. They were sent In here when Esjgs
were high some time ago and will be worked
off as bakers' Eggs. They are held at 24905'
per dozen. They are small and brown and in
ferior to our local product. There is a shipper
In Shanghai who ships to London and he ?ent
this K>t here as a "flyer."

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Trade in Citrus fruits continued to improre,
under the stimulus of the warm, sunny weath
er, but prices were no higher, as stocks of all
descriptions we^e still far tn excess of re
quirements. Fancy Navel Orange* were still
dragging, but the standard and choice grades
moved freely, cheap fruit being wanted by
peddlers and small retailers. The Apple mar
ket was still weak for ordinary offerings,
which were in heavy supply, while fancy New
town Pippins and Spitzenbergs continued flrm
at the outside quotation. Banana 3 were in
heavy supply and prices ruled in favor of
buyers.

reported, . one broker selling $120,000 a day or

that the bond business of this market Is much

Even if there were seventy concerts

HEAD SOLID SORE
Awful Suffering of Baby and
Sleepless Nights of
Mother.
CURED BY CUTICURA
Skin Fair as a Lily with no Scar
to Recall Awful Sore
. : Writes Mother.
" I herewith write out in full the be-
ginning and end of that terrible disease
eczema," sayi Mrs. Wm. Ryer, Elk
Rircr, Minn., "which caused mybar>e
untold Buffering and myself- many
â¢leepless nights. .My babe was born
seemingly a fair',- healthy child, but
when 6he was three weeks old a swell-
ing appeared on the back of her head,
and in course of time : broke. It did
not heal but grew worse, and the sore
spread f roai the size of a dime to that
of a dollar. I used all kinds, of reme- .
dies that I could think of, but nothing
seemed to help; in fact, it grew worse.
Her hair fell out where the. sore was,
and I feared it would never grow again. j
It continued until my aged father came
on a visit, and when he saw the baby
he told me to get Cuticura and
Ointment right away.
"To please him I did so, and to my
â¢urprise by their use the sore began to
heal over, the hzir grew over it, and
to-day she hs.s a nice head of hair, her
skin is as fair as a lily, and she has no
scar left to recall that awful sore, and
it is over ei^ht aonths and no sign of
its returning.''
CURE PERMANENT
"Your letter of the irjth inst. re-
ceived, asking in regard to the cure of
my baby some six years ago. Well,
the direasc has never returned to her
head which at that time was" a solid

no other Finger. She represents the
jeweled and luxurious side of art in her
every phase, the royalty of music, the
CiUnendom of song.
The suggestion was in ample and
most agreeable evidence last evening.
No singf-r coming hore of recent years,
for example, has surrounded himself
or herself with such a luxuriously dis
tinguished company as sets Melba
about this seasonâ Gilibert. who de
velops as a thoroughly delightful con
cert singer: Sassoli. a young girl harp
ist who is a phenomenal sort of person:
Ellison Van Hoose. an effective tenor,
and Mr. North, a flutist worthy of his
'iuti^s as obligato maker to her
majesty, Melba. Add to these an effec
tive local orchestra numbering fifty
men, under Paul Steindorff's direction,
and it will be seen that the setting is
worthy of the diva.
[f is fou- years since Melba was hero.
i singing th<=> "mad sc>ne" from "Lucia'"
|as she sang it last night. Of it and
her I wrote thenâ in my young and
enthusiastic daysâ "Her voice suggests
as no other voice the word "perfect."
Tt is th^ voice of which one has
-lreamed. dropping tho'silver chain of
sound without a break.' It is as the
lark s 'that at heavens gato sings,
crystal clear, each note pure as a peari,
from the merest silken thread of a
sound to a round, full, victorious note
\ t>l an infinite deliciousness of satis-
I faction.
"The suggestion of technique in the
connection seems a fallacy and a su
perstition, yet it must be remembered
:hat here to nature has been added
perfect art. that highest art that con
< r alp art. She has a wonderful stac
cato, drip â dripping its light and liquid
nott into the harmonious chalice of
thp orchestra below, or flying sheerly
heavenward â where the angels prob
ably make it over for^home consump-
I cpuld not quite set my name to all
i ( that now, that is. as to last night's
rt. There is still the same mar
velous, absolute ease of method; still
the wonderful liquid, fluty quality of
voice, yr-t ihe voice had not last night
the brilliant, sheer purity it had then.
One got husky threads now and again,
particularly in the upper range, which
is possibly why the singer saved her
setf more than one top note â not to
mention a cadenza or two â in the "mad
m <r.r> ' But it is a glorious voice,
natheless, so round and rich. Tetraz
zini? Of course. Well, I dropped in for
half of the "mad scene" at the Tivoli
last nightâ wading through six deep
standing to get near to it. Little Tet
razzini and the flute were engaged in
their immortal duel of sweets, and I
had just heard the other. One may
still be very glad of Tetrazzini. Of
course, Melba's voice is larger, as I
have before said, and it is sweeter,
ik herâ richer now than when she was
here before to my earâ yet the Tivoli
prima donna distinctly has it in purity
and freshness. And you got all the ca
tas. The curtain, too. fell on a
clean, dazzling high note that Melba
h rvetf might have owned. We may be
very ?da<l <-f Tetrazzifii.
eoorsÂ« the "mad* scene" was en
â  oied. and Melba gave them an en
tirely charming French chanson.
"Solr Paien," exquisitely sung, and
delightfully accompanied by Mr.
North on the flute and Miss Davies at
ihe piano. The real event of the even-
Inc was, however, the singing f
Tosti's "Goodbye." which not altogeth
er distinguished ballad Madame Melba
contrived to transform into a little
classic tragedy. It was as full of emo
ttonal spell as that immortal Marguer
ite she gave us here, and aroused an
extraordinary enthusiasm. The en
cere, "Over the Hills," was sung with

POLICE FIND
WOUNDED THIEF
Capture Frank Hawley, Who
Was Shot by Policeman
While Avoiding Arrest
ACCOMPLICE LOCKED UP
Man Found in Room Armed
With a Colt's Revolver Is
Taken to Hall of Justice
After working two days on the case
the police last night succeeded in find
ing Frank Hawley, the burglar who
was shot by Policeman J. H. Helms
last Sunday at First and Harrison
streets. Hawley was located by Po
licemen Helms, Conlon and McGowan
at 604 ] .,Â£ Third street, where he was
nursing a wounded foot, the result of
Helms' marksmanship. When arrested
Hawley admitted that he was the man
wanted and gave the police an account
of his escape.
In the room with Hawley at the time
the police entered was a man named
Mike Morrisey, believed to bo the for
mer's accomplice. On being searched a
Colt's revolver was found on him and
he was arrested and taken to the Hall
of Justice and his name placed on the
detinue book. Hawley was arrested,
but taken to the Central Emergency
Hospital, where his wounded foot was
dressed. No bones were broken by the
bullet.
On Sunday night Policeman Helnis
paw a man trying to enter the grocery
and barroom of R. and H. Muegge at
First and Harrison streets. He pur
sued the robber down Harrison street
to Fremont and over Fremont to Fo!
som, where the man jumped over a
high fence. As he did so Helms firi'd.
but the man got away. Helms knew
that he hit the man. as there were
bloodmarks near the fence.
Hawley lived at th<* Aurora House,
SOS Folsom, where he went immediateiy
after he waa plvt. but yesterday hÂ«
moved to the Third street house. He
is 20 years of age and says he is a
stevedore.

JURY ACQUITS KPSTEIX
IX JUDGE I.AWI.OH'S COURT
Upon Proving an Alibi It is Decided
That Defendant Did Not Receive
Stolen Goods.
The jury in Judge Lawlor's court,
after being out for several hours last
night, acquitted Louis Epstein, a sec
ond-hand dealer, of receiving stolen
goods. Epstein's place of business is
at 538 Mission street, and there, it was
charged, he received certain stolen
goods-- belonging to the Pacific Steel
and Hardware Company.
During the trial it was contended
that Epstein entered into a contract
with a clerk named Talbot, in the em
ploy of the firm, whereby Epstein* was
to pay him $5 a week for hardware.
The firm, it is said, declined to prose
cute Talbot on account of his youth.
It is also said that more than $200
worth of hardware was recovered by
Detective Matheson for the firm. Afi
bis wore introduced in favor of Ep
stein and he was acquitted.

ly, she makes, too, a royal picture.
Sassoli, the harpist, does the incredi

it to be possessed of beauties that most
of us are not at all inclined to crjedit it
with. She has a dazzlinc technique,
an astonishing tone, a great musical
sense and wonderfully the spirit of her
instrument. Poenitz and Godefroid
furnished her material which was
much above the usual average of harp
literature. Miss Sassoli is just 17. Mr.
Gilibert again was thoroughly delight
ful in his French songs. He shows
himself an artist to the finger tips,
and has a full, smooth, vibrant bary
tone that gives constant pleasure.
Sympathy, tenderness, humor, are also
his in ample degree. He sang songs by
Martini. and Wekerlin, and "Malgre
Moi" by Pfeiffer.
Mr. Van Hoose is alsc possessed of a
big voice, a virile, brilliant tenor. His
â¢Voir Griseldis" was not particularly
fortunate, but in his encore he showed
taste, sentiment and graceful tech
nique. Mr. Steindorff and his men

ELLIS MAY NOT GO ON STAND
BEFORE POLICE BOARD.
HOW TO DISMISS
HIM PERPLEXING
CHEUNG ALSO RECALCITRANT
Though the Police Commission has
Its mind well made up that Sergeant
Thomas Ellis, who confessed to the
Grand Jurj r that he accepted bribes
from the gambling games in China
town for police protection, must be dis
missed from the force, the law com
mands eC .fair and impartial trial, and
it is not certain just how the board
will bring the result about.
The Commissioners dragged through
two hours of warmed-over testimony
last night and when the point was
reached where it was expected that
Sergeant Ellis would go on the stand
and set off the fireworks that every one
was looking for, his attorney was not
ready to allow him to testify. After
a mere sputtering to afford entertain
ment the case of the confessed bribe
taker was adjourned to Friday even
ing.
The Commissioners have an idea that
they can place Ellis in the witness
chair and extract from him the con
fession he made to the Grand Jury of
taking $250 and sometimes $275 a week
from Chan Cheung, the "statesman"
who disbursed the Chinatown corrup
tion fund. It is not believed, however,
that the sergeant is in a mood to do
any more confessing. The law is that
a policeman accused before the com
mission shall be given "a fair and im
partial trial." A fair and impartial
trial is one conducted according to the
procedure and rules of evidence that
obtain in the courts.
It is a question whether the Grand
Jury will surrender the transcript it
has of Ellis' confession. Foreman An
drews snirl yesterday that he did not
think it wotlld be right or legal to dis
close what took place in the secret
chambers. Therefore if Ellis refuses
to testify before the commission it
looks as if thp board will not be able
to pry into the corruption in China
town. The hearing thus far has been
held on the charges that the sergeant
neglected hfs duty by permitting gam
bling to be carried on and that he noti
fied the fantan manager? of the ap
proach of Commissioner Hutton for
the purpose of making a raid on the
night of December 29.
SAYS CARPENTER GAVE TIP.
One of the Chinese witnesses testified
that L. G. Carpenter, an attorney who
had been co-operating with Hutton,
warned Chinatown of the Commis
sioner's intended visit, and this fur
ther clouds the case against the ac
cused sergeant. The powers of the;
commission are largely arbitrary, how
ever, 'and it is understood that the
chief purpose of tho members is to es
tablish the case far enough that Ellis
can be dismissed from the department.
Lee Sing was recalled to the stand
last night. He repeated the story he
told at an investigation several months
ago that he was in a gambling resort
on Spofford alley on one occasion when
two policemen came in ostensibly to
raid the place. An interpreter was
sent for, and after he had whispered
to the minions of the law for a few
minutes they departed without making
any arrests.
Members of the Chinatown squad
wen- called before him and he identi
fied Patrolmen Charles E. Munn and
William Doran as the two policemen
whose strange conduct gave rise to
suspicion.
Chin Fee once more told how his
house at 11 Ross alley was constantly
visited by the police and the operations
of his tables prevented by the espion
age until he began making a weekly
contribution of $10 to the corruption
fund. After that no policeman ever
came in sight and his games were not
molested.
William Minehan. -who accompanied
former Commissioner Hutton on the
raid of 820 Washington street the night
of December 29, was the first witness
called in the hearing. He was unable
to say that any gambling was goin?
on, for by the time entrance was ef
fected all evidence had been rsmovod.
ORDERS TO STOP GAMBLING.
"What have been your instructions
from superior officers as to the fantan
games?" queried Drinkhouse.
"To suppress gambling in all forms,"
was the answer of the patrolman.
It appeared that the witness did not
know much about the game of fantan,
and it was difficult for him to explain
conclusively that gambling was carried
on in the place that was raided.
Sergeant Ellis arrived about ten min
utes after Hutton, L. G. Carpenter and
the witness had gained entrance. The
sergeant came in response to a whistle
call by the Chinamen.
At this point Commissioner Poheim
essayed propounding the law, tried to
swing a phrase in Latin and made a
laughable failure of it. He said:
"The Supreme Court has ruled that
the discovery of gaming paraphernalia
in a place is bona fide evidence that it
is a gambling resort."
Chan Cheung's array of lawyers,
who sat bunched in a corner with ex-
Governor Budd in the center, tittered
Irrepressibly and the young president
of the commission realized that he had
better confine his exploits with the
dead language to the writing of pre
scriptions.
Minehan was excused from the
stand, whereupon Budd stepped for
ward and said his client, Chan Cheung,
whom Ellis named in' his confession as
the disbursing agent of the corruption
fund, was present in response to a
subpena.
"But," said the former Governor, "we
must advise him not to testify, taking
advantage of the constitutional priv
ilege that he cannot be compelled to
incriminate himself. While we have
no fear of the consequences, it would
not be in the best interests of his case
for him to go on the stand at this time.
The police committee of the Grand
Jury has left us in the dark as to the
evidence against Cheung, and this
gambling phase may be interlaced
with the charge of murder. He Is un
der indictment for murder. The com
mittee kidnaped him and held him
prisoner for forty-eight hours without
warrant of law " â¢
"The police committee of the Grand
Jury has done many funny things,"
interjected the quick-spoken Poheim.
"Well, they unlawfully restrained
him of his liberty," was the only com
ment Budd made. â¢
He added that the evidence that
was adduced to connect Chan Cheung
with the killing of Tom Yick had
"flashed into the memory of the wit
nesses at a late day, long after there
had been thorough investigations of
tho case by former Grand Juries."
Chan Cheung was accordingly ex
cused from testifying.
A call was made for another Chi
nese witness and then It was discover
ed that the following Chinatown
statesmen had ignored the subpena*
the commission Issued for them: Chin
Bok Gai, Chin Gin Tv, Mah Lin Git,
Wong Yu and Quong Bin; Wong
Fook, who is in St. Louis, and Jim
Wong, who is in Chicago.
FEAR INDICTMENT.
Attorney Meyer and Attorney Glov
er announced that they represented
the absentees who had failed to ap
pear for the same reason that Cham I
Cheung gave. They had been threat
ened with -indictment in connection ;
with the murder of Tom Yick. and
would rather stand in contempt of the
board than risk giving testimony \
that might be used against them by j
the Grand Jury.
"I will agree to produce these men
if they are examined on matters that
would not affect their cases," suggest
ed Meyer.
"Never you mind, we will look after
having them brought here," spoke up
Commissioner Reagan.
Then Meyer and Glover facetiously
said their clients feared kidnaping by
the â¢ Grand Jury if they should ven
ture near the Hall of Justice.
It was finally agreed that the law
yers should have the statesmen on
hand on Friday evening at 7:30
o'clock.
Chief Wittman took the stand to tell
of tho orders he gave Sergeant Ellis in
placing him in command of the China
town squad, to suppress gambling in
all its forms. In answer to questions
by Commissioner Drinkhouse the Chief
said he frequently visited Chinatown,
but was never able to see any evidence
of gambling.
"Did Sergeant Ellis ever report to
you that gambling was going on in
Chinatown?"
"Yes, he told me the games would
start every now and then and that he
would stop them. I told him it was
rumored his men w< â accepting mon
ey from the gamblers and that he
shouhl warn them. He said he had al
ready done so. I advised him to be
careful of the Chinese Educational So
ciety, because it might try to entrap
him or his men. and he said he had
cautioned his men in this regard also."
President Poheim announced that the
prosecution rested its case, with a res
ervation of the right to call the wit
nesses who had not responded to the
subpenaes.
Attorney Mogan said he had no evi
dence to offer until the prosecution's
evidence was all in.
"How about Ellis? Can't you call
him to the stand?" asked the presiding
officer.
The lawyer said he had not decided
whether or not to place the defendant
on the stand. He added that he did not
think the board would be justified in
compelling him to testify.
It was agreed that Mogan should an
nounce definitely on Friday evening
what course he 1b to pursue.

tivity yesterday, enjoying the relaxa
tion following the conclusion of its
Chinatown investigations. Last night
they were at the theaters and the air
of school-out enthusiasm was about
them.
The committeemen are not altogeth
er agreed as to Ellis' confession of
accepting bribes from the fantan
games. Foreman Andrews and Dis
trict Attorney Byington, the latter
having taken a prominent part in the
investigations, are convinced that the
strgeant has not told all he knows.
"I am willing to take my medicine,
but I don't want to be known as a
squealer," was one of his emphatic
statements during the sweating pro-
ctss. s
On the other hand, Messrs. Bowes
and Stafford are equally positive that
Ellis has not held back a bit of in
formation he possesses, whether it
would incriminate any one else or
himself further. They feel assured
that he has made a clean breast of
everything. They admit his strong in
clination to shield others and take the
brunt on his own shoulders. But in
the heat of the 'sweatbox' he put no
restraint on his tongue, they say, and
did not have himself sufficiently col
lected to hide anything under the hot
fire of questioning.
Andrews and Byington point to the
fact that Ellis now asserts that he
never said it was Sergeant Christian
sen who gave him the tip to call on
Chan Cheung for the weekly rake-off
from the corruption sack. There can
be no question that the confessed
bribe-taker made the statement to the
committee, for the shorthand record
corroborates the memories of the Jur
ors. But now comes Ellis, in fear of
being regarded as a "squealer," and
seeks to withdraw his statement im
plicating a fellow sergeant. The dis
position to shield alj but himself is
to strong, the District. Attorney and
the foreman declare, that there is no
doubt in their minds that he is with
holding information tha^ would place
other persons in a very uncomforta
ble predicament.
Sergeant Ellis and Patrolman Heinz
and O'Brien should have taken lessons
from Chan Cheung in the art of pro
testing innocence, say the J u rÂ°rÂ»-
When the wily Mongol was confronted
with the confession of Ellis that he
had been paid $250 a week by him for
immunity from the law Cheung mere
ly turned up his nose in derision and
refused to talk. He baffled his inter
rogators at every turn.
