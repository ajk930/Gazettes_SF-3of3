.The document Is of the deepest im
portance In the prÂ«ser.t state of Hussia
and indicates that the Government,
while steadily proceeding in its. planp
for the JulfUlmcnt of the imperial promi
ses contained in the rescript of March
5, is determined not to be swerved frotp
its purpose by the. pressure, of military
and naval disasters, but, in its 'own
time and as speedily as possible, to'give
the nation the legislative body "on '.yhich
the Bouligan . commission . has been
working. In It may, perhaps, also be
taken as an intimation that the war will
continue and that the question of peace
will not be submitted to a Zemsky
Sobor. . .
According to the Russ, the result of
the labors of the Bouligan commission,
â¢which has now been printed and sub
mitted to the commissioners, does not
embody a definite plan for the organiza
tion and functions of a new. govern
mental body, but rather a collection and
classification of the necessary data for
the formation of an assembly, giving
alternative views of the various points
in dispute and leaving the final decision
in the hands of the Ministers. .
GROUPING OF THE DATA.
An officer on board the Russian cruiser
Oles EayÂ« that the unexploded torpedoes
discharged by the Japanese are a menace
to shipping in the China Sea. .
The aeaths to-day aboard the Russian
ships now bring the total of killed up to
lorty-one. and there are five additional
cases in the hospital. American navy
surgeons are assisting the Russian sur
geons in their work of "caring for the
wounded.
Rear Admiral Endqulst lost, bis flagship
in the naval fight and then transferred
his flag to the Aurora and left the fight
ou Saturday night. He claims that he did
not know that the fight was continued on
Sunday. He declared that the Japanese
attack was to sudden and so ferocious
that his section was completely over
whelmed. The ships of his section while
attempting to reach Vladivostok were at
the same time looking for a fight with
the Japanese and when they encountered
tfceir opponents fought gallantly.
The Russian chips steamed into Ma
nila at a speed of fifteen knots. The Rus
sians are now taking on food supplies.
RUSSIANS EXPECTED VICTORY.
Rear Admiral Enquist and staff then
called upon Major General Corbin, \to
whom Rear Admiral Enquist expressed
great gratitude for the hospitality and
comfcrt afforded the l'ussians and the
courtesy with which General Corbin of
fered the use of the army hospitals, to
gether with surgeons and food for the
wounded Russian sailors. General Corbin
aFki-d:
"Admiral, how many admirals were
there in the fight?"
"There were four of us." replied the
admiral. *"ThÂ« others are in better luck
new than I."
The tears were dreaming down th#
Russian officer's face as he raid "this.
*"My ships are unseaworthy. I have
Â»ot heard from my Government and I
jequest time to make repairs," -
. Governor "Wright replied that, eccord
tns to Ills construction of the neutrality
laws, the Russian vessels could remain
long enough to make necessary repairs,
and. after these were finished, they
must leave within tweaty-four hours or
dismantle and intern. Rear Admiral
Enquist requested permission to bring
his ships behind tho breakwater for re-.
pairs. This request was granted him
and the ships will be moved on Tuesday
morning. -
Narita Goro. the Japanese Consul,
called upon Governor Wright Just pre
vious to Rear Admiral Enquist and.
made inquiry regarding the probable
disposition of the Russian warships.
On leaving he met Rear Admiral 'En-
Quist in the corridor of the Governor's
residence and tendered him a profound
salutation.
MANILA. June 4.â The board of inspec
tion appointed by Admiral Train to ex
amine the Russian cruisers that have ar
rived here reports that sixty days will be
required to repair the Oleg, thirty days
the Aurora and seven days tfie Jemtchug.
Admiral Enquist requests permission to
repair here, as his ships are unable to
sail except in a smooth sea on account of
the unpatched boles near the water line. -.
Rear Admiral Enquist, accompanied
by Rear Admiral Train and the French
Consul, formally called upon Governor
General Wright to-day. After the usual
greetings had been exchanged. Gov
ernor Wright asked":
"Admiral Enquist, do you wish to

ITXPAMII.IAR. FORCES.
Now If we examine the matter I think we
â¢hull find that the miracles recorded In Scrip
ture cr in thÂ» records of the church do not
absolutely require for their explanation .any
suspension of the' laws.' of nature any more
then 'would b* needed in the example Just giv
en, j So. though .we are net obliged to. we
may waive, for arcument> rate, any question
of nuch euÂ»pÂ»nÂ»>ion. and thus still more effect
ually- â¢â¢â¢Â»*.Â«â¢Â«â¢ th* objections madÂ«.- As In the
ca*e given, fo In that of the healing nf the
sJi-k, though It Involve the rennovatlon of dis
â¢as*d cr *orrup<tÂ«d flei<h.- or even tn that of
the resfnriÃg to life of th* dead, the natural
laws and force.* need not be suspended. No
one Imaciif r that the natural - laws which
would bring ebout death in a dangerouii dis
ease ir* *urpen<led by the uÂ»Â» of medicine, but
that otlirrs are brought in to counteract them.
L^t us see now Just .what is meant .by,, sus
pension. _of the laws of nature. Suppose a
stone t,o be thrcwn'lr.to ths aIF and that just
whÂ»a it reaches Its highest point it should ft
naHi there and drift about as a mote, such as
wÂ«- fee' in a sunbeam, practically doeÂ«. If the
law of gravity w*re suspended in the case of
this Eton* this If Just what would happen. But
ought we to Jmmed'etely epnHudÂ«>, if such a
V'heneiEcnoii mere observed, that such a ru*
per-sion of this natural jaw had occurred?- No. j
>."ot becau** It would t* i hi i "fusible, but b*-'

ing gravity:" And we If without prej
udle*. rot d*nj-_ use fact, but try to find out
what this foreÂ« wa*.
\u25a0 Tf 'we 'wlrti. then to retain even natural re
ligion we roust allow llvat a. suspension. of the
laws of nature is possible. â¢:
â¢ Of course. our objectors may. adopt panthe
i>m or any other system that thÂ»y choose.
Buf they must produce arguments for It. They'
bave.no right' to take, it for granted. -Thf-y
must prove it. which they n^ver hÂ«VÂ« done
â¢nd ne^-er can do. I But if thej- could, they
wfeuld' deetroy natural religion by it, as has
jutt been shfjwn. as well as the Christianity,
the miracles of which they wish to- discredit.
But if nature were uncreated, it would be
\u2666terns! in the papt as well a s tn the future,
for it is impossible f or what doÂ«Â» not exist to
rr<vjuce : itself. Th^re would then be- no God
cthT.than nature HaeK. for a Gcd^ilmply co
Â«"xifcVinp with nature wouh] be- no God--nt all.
Th<Â» .ifira of God requires that he should be
the Â«nÂ» and only bHng existing from eternity,
and independent of all rise. To put nature
in tnÂ»' place 'of -God Vs what- iÂ« known- as pan
rhÂ»ism, really a form of atheism, for nature
cannot have the attributes efsenttal to God.
But the main reason for doubt Â«f Ctristian
iniraxlcs that w have generally had to ccn
tÂ»-nd with is a doubt of. the potsibility of mira
cles at all. A miracle, it Is said, is againtt
thÂ» lawÂ»- of nature, and we \u25a0 are assured by
come people, in the name of science, that the
laws of nature can bo more be broken than
tics* of mathematics; that to expect a miracle
is as 'afcsurd as it would bÂ« to expect to wake
up eÂ«>K.e fine morning and fisd that two and
two make five, or that the different straight
lines can be drawn from one point to another.
This assertion may se^m plausible, but it
amounts to this: that" the laws cf nature are
Inherent in it and inseparable from It and that
they cannot poj-sibly work In any way differ
ent from the actual one nhich we observe.
Tfcis \u25a0 means . that nature is uncreated: for â¢if
we- allow that there is a creator of the natu
ral world.. Its larws ar.d its forces must be
merely Implanted in if by him. and it could
not possibly be beyond his power to change
them, either temporarily or permanently. He
mutt be able to simply suspend them; that Is,
to cause their operation to ctasi' for a time,
Cr^o substitute others for them. It would be
impossible for' the creature to get beyond the
control of th 6 creator or to become Independent
of him. -
THE.DOLET OF MIRACLES.
The reason for such doubts is, we may say,
two-fold- With come It is hatred or dislike for
Christianity, *t any rate of any dog
matic kind. Joined with a feeling that if
cue Christian miracle, particularly & con
clusive one 15ke thif, is admitted, the whole
reilgion will tM^e to follow: that if you say
A. \u25a0'â¢you- will- he ve to go right through -to-Z.
OtSjer m-racles may be conceded, but no: those
which so to prove the truth of Christ and of
h!s 'church- \Vith people so disposed, reason
ing ie". of ccurse. impossible, and "we' need ' not
masle'time on It. ;
The real, tangible and material â though glo
rifiÂ«dâbody of our Lord actually left this
etrth. remaining only in its sacramental' fcrm.
This is the Indubitable fact of the ascension to
ell Cathollce. and Indeed we may say to all
who can properly be called Christians. To
thote who *re not, it seems a picus fable nr
lc'read. perhaps origlrating in some ocular

Lieutenant Peary has completed all his
plans for the trip and Ue will sail from
the Maine coast not later than June la
for New York. He wilL. remain in that
city- until July i,- when he will start on
his cruise northward. The first and only
etop will be at St. Johns, N. F., where his
supplies will be replenished and his crew
of Esquimaux taken on. ..Us route from
St. Johns will be directly through the
Gulf of St. Lawrence to the Labrador^.
coast. Thence he will proceed to the,
west coast of Greenland as far as Cape ;
York. . There hi* sledge dogs .will be tak-'
en on and he will then sail to . the.
of Grant Land, on the southern 'extreme
ity of the Northern Polar Sea. {
By that time, it is expected, it will be
September, the beginning of the long
Polar night. During the period of dark^
ness Peary will establish various depots
for provisions and when dawn comes be
will start northward with his Esquimaux
and endeavor to cover the remaining 500
miles of unknown land and frozen sea
which lie between the northern shore of
Grant Land and his final goal. It is In
that territory that he expects to find an
area of 3,000,000 square miles at the pole,'
Where the foot of man has never trod. â¢

PHILADELPHIA, June 4. â The ex

seventy of the reform organization,
which took a prominent part in the gas
lease fight and which had a ticket
known as the "City party" ia the field
ajL the last city election, issued its
declaration of principles to-night for
the ccraliis local political campaign- It
saye:
* "The main end whicb this committee
has in view is the good government
of our city by the people and tor the
people. To crcompiish this result it
proposes to devote its best efforts as
fellows:
. "1. To the election of boaest. capable
and disinterested officials, and to this
esd It will aid the constituted authori
ties by every tseans in Its power in
parsing the Assessor's list and in the
honest enforcement of the election
laws.
â¢ "2. In advocating personal registra
tion is obedience to the mandate of the
people, which the recent Legislature so
op<*n!y disobeyed.
"3. Jn advocating the repeal of the
E*!r.endsicr.ts to the Bullitt bill, which
tervc to mutilate the best charter we
ever had. (Tee recent Legislature
aniendcd the city charter bo that after
iiayor Weaver's term expires. Councils
and not the Mayor shall have the power
of appointing and removing the direc
tors pt the departments of Public Safety
itnd Public Works.)
CHICAGO, June 4 â An adjustment of
the teamsters' strike "by mediation
seems as remote to-night as it did two
months- ago. ' Peace negotiations /begun
last week, which* promised." to ,brlrig
about an amicable adjustment â¢of the
difficulty; nave"."been abandoned for, the
present at least and the strike will be
allowed to take its natural' course, ac
cording to President Shea of the Team
sters' Union. â¢ A natural-course means
one 'of two things, either 1 a spread. of
Â£he strike or def<*at ; for- the" union,' as
all business-f irms now involved In the
trouble 'absolutely* refuse" to "concede
anything further In' the'fcoÃtroversy* or
to bring about a settlement." . - *~ '
' "Peace 'negotiations are oft tor ;aH
time?* said Levy Mayer,' chief counsel
for* the 'employer's; to-night. "We abso
lutely are flnisbed'with all conferences
with the strikers. The only thing that
prevented, a settlement "of -the whole
trouble last night 'was 'pique on', the
part "of President Shea because hV bad
been" slighted 1n â¢ the., conferences 'and
was angere<i on" "account' of his afrest.
ThY bnly- waV that a settlement can' be
reached now is for the strikers -to
acknowledge defeat."
"The employers blocked a settlement
last riight," said President Shea to-day.
â¢Their objection" 'to the': men "wearing
union buttons 'and .a refusal to l'agree
not to discriminate against the strikers
iras all that prevented the calling off
of the strike. We feel that our. posiiton
is as strong as it was a month ago' and
we are not going to/give in now ; that
we believe we have the struggle prac
tically won. \u25a0 Those business ttrms In
volved in thet'strike 'are losing money
every day and they 'are getting tired
of it. Theyiwill ! soonvbe twilling to
come tp us ,and "sue for.. peace. :. -Our
men are. perfectly satisfied with mat T
ters as and we are not going
to accept".any jiropo.sitfon'.fr'om the emr

the .standing of . Ihe Teamsters'^ Union."
.The .spread, of, the "strike_ 'depend^
upon' a meetjng' to "be held.tb-mOrrqw,

IX, THE GAKDEX CITY
To the Aliens, who have befriended the
girl, the charge of arson^came as a sur
prise and was treated" as a joke until the
arrival of Detective! Bell. Then they, as
sured him that the girl was all right and
needed no looking after, while Miss Os
born. in the- presence of the detective,
threatened to have the girl sent to . the
Magdalen Asylum. They spoke of her as
a quiet young lady and incapable of .com
mitting the crime of which she Is in
formally accused. '
While the young woman h2s been out
until 12 at night attending .lanpes there
has been nothing In her conduct to war
rant suspicion. The attempt, if there way
one. was not well planned, there being
only paper, and, the woodwork being only
sllgrhtly charred. The girl says she has
often had trouble in the house and could
well believe her enemies capable of start
ing the fire and accusing her, in the hope
that she might be sent to a home.
Detective Bell diagnosed the case as a
famÂ»y row and was satisfied that the
accused young woman should come to the
Kail or Justice this morning: and tell her
story. It is unlikely that. any move will
be made by the police unless Miss Osborn
swears to a complaint. This Is not prob
able, as she seems to have no evidence be
yond suspicion. .

girl was befriended by Mr. and Mrs. Al
len until the parents, who went to Palo
Alto, s bould send for her. -On Thursday
Miss Osborn had an altercation with the
Eirl, and. losing self-control, called her a
vile name. The girl Indignantly denied
the accusation and retorted that she must
have been a similar kind of woman to
think of such a charge. This incensed
the landlady, who struck Miss Chivelle,
and the Incident ended In tears.
The entire story of Miss Osborn is de
nied by Miss Chivelle, with the exception
of the slappinp. The girl says she has
always behaved herself in a becoming
manner, and that many insinuations were
made in the house by a clique inspired
with Jealousy. She knew nothing about
the fire : until accused by Miss Osborn.
and spoke of its having occurred at 8
o'clock In the evening. This is the time
she understood Miss Osborn to say, al
though the .landlady distinctly eaid it
took Dlace-in the. .morning. ~..
Tlic police were yesterday requested by
Miss F. L. Osbora. landlady at 706 Van
Ness avenue, to investigate the origin of
a fire that occurred in hejr house at 8
o'clock Friday morning. The woman ac
cused a -17-year-old girl. Nellie Chivelle,
of starting the blaze in a spirit of re
venge. The landlady says she had
trouble with the girl's parents and also
m-ith the girl, at one time slapping her
# face, and attributes this as the cause of
'arson. The girl avers that she has been
continually harrassed by several women
In the house and was compelled to leave.
No charge and no arrests have been
made, and Detective Bell, who was de
tailed to the case, believes that no serious
attempt was made to burn the house.
The place where the fire started was
in a bathroom on the ground floor. Some
newspapers had been lighted and the
flaraes Sad scorched tne wainscoting,
while the close proximity of carpeting
might have contributed to a spread of the
blzze. The fire was discovered and quick
ly quenched by Mrs. El!a Prankard. a
lodger In the house, who notified Miss
Osborn.
Miss Osborn immediately concluded
that It was the work of the girl and ac
cused her of the deed. Miss Chevllle tear
fully denied the charge and left the
house. Then it was that Miss Osborn
became suspicious and notified the police.
' Miss Osborn said that she had been in
CilSculty with Mr. and Mrs. W. E. Kent,
the stepfather and mother of Nellie, ow
ing to unpaid rent, and finally allowed
them to go. canceling a debt o,t $30. The

Real Heroes of . War .TLa*eÂ»
In e%-ery modern, war. but one, the..pro
pcrtlon of, deaths among th* TpMTful of
ficers has been greater than that among
Toe combatants. . In the French campaign
against Constant JnÂ« .while " every ;thir
teenth -combatant officer was killed every
sixth surgeon died.. In the. Crimean:. war
the mortality , among the surgeons was
T?.2 per cent and amonp the csjnjba-tant
officers 7.3. In the last Russian catppalsn
prior to the present war 255 surgeons out
of a total of. 2533 died. . In ..the Mexican
expedition (French) the â¢ mortality . rate
.among, .th* surgeons .was about "20 per
cent.' while, among the cofiihatant officers
it was only about 4 per cent." HerÂ«uÂ°. then,
all. unheralded in the daily, news of great
victories, are the real heroes of .war. who
die not In an effort to kill, but to.'say*
lives. He who would have a ,correet 4 estl

Johnson Sides, a noted "Indian temper
ance orator of bygone days: Ope day he
was caught in - the act of drinkins a
glass of whisky and was fined. Neither
Indians nor whites would listen then
to his temperance speeches. Poor John
son was in despair. One --day, however,
he had an inspiration. Ha asked Sena
tor Doolin of the Nevada. Legislature
to absolve his sin by act of thÂ» Legis
lature. Senator Doolin was agreeable
and. introduced and . . carried., through
"3enate Joint . Concurrent Resolution
No. 11." which Is as follows: "Resolved,
by the Senate, -the people of; the State
of Nevada concurring. That the drlnk-of
whisky taken by Johnson Side* on Sep

ty of Story, be and .is. hereby -declared

There have recently- been hatched out
In the aquarium's fish- hatchery "3000 land
locked salmon, from .eggs received from
the United States Jssh hatchery- at. Green
Lake. Maine. The aquarium has now.
all hatched in its own hatchery, youns
brook trout, rainbow, trout, lake trout,
white fish and .the .landlocked salmon. _
Among the fishes thus hatched out he/c
there have been, as may be seen in any
fish hatchery, the usual limited r number
of freak fishes, these, however, being most
likely to be found among rainbow and
brook-trout-- Among the little crook trout,
here there were two albinos, flesh colored
little fishes, with pink eyes, fishes looking
something like tiny golden Ide.
Among the little rainbow trout there
were some with two heads and but a
single: tall, "the two 'heads joined to ona
body.' 'There were also fishes 'with two
heads 'and .'two tails. - like two fishes
joined together, y \u25a0 , -\u25a0 . \u25a0.":"':
These curious and interesting little freak
ns hes -would become veritable \u25a0 marvels If
they ever lived to grow up, but they rare
ly survive '.beyond the time required for
the ; absorption of the ' yelk sack, from
which the fish derives Its sustenance un
til It is big enough to eat. Out at the
United < Government fish hatchery at Dtt
luth,-Minn.; they once raised a double
headed rainbow trout to the age of seven
months, when It was about two inches In
length, but this is perhaps the record for
two-beaded fishes.â N.T. Sun!

WARD'S ELEVEN
IS VICTORIOUS
Gardner's victory brings him into prom
inence with a bound, as this is the \ first
tournament be, has succeeded In- winning,
although he has often" contested. It ' is
something remarkable for a young player
to cÂ°> from the ranks to the head of the
list at one ' bound In this way, " and his
achievement sta.mps him as a unique
champion. His victory, was a popular one
and will doubtless prove a - good . thing
for the game, as it will encourage young
players -to persevere and new ones to
take up the game with an eye to future
contests and trophies.
The complete score, of the match was
7-5. 7-5,:3-â¬, 7-5.

Again in the third set Murdock started
with a rush and this time managed to
go the distance " without being ' headed,
winning the set, fc-3. It seemed he had
come into his true form and would, con
tinue to assert himself, but it proved
only a. flash In the pan. .
Gardner, started in the lead in the
fourth set, running the score to 3-1. when
Murdock flared up -in. what proved to. be
his last attempt, and .by good tennis
pulled up to 5-4 in his favor.; Then .he
faded away and Gardner rushed the set
to Its close, winning the next three
games, set. match, trophy and title. His
victory was a deserved one. being j ac
complished by steady. Bafe play. ; and.
while his game : was . not a particularly,
brilliant one it was consistent through
out the tournament he is entitled to
great credit. The tennis was not of a
specially high character. of play, but the
match was Interesting, although . Mur
dock. did not do himself, justice. He has
p'-ayed better tennis than he displayed
In this match, and neither In 'form -nor
condition . seemed to ' be' fairly" ait himself.
The tale of the second set was like
tinto the first. Murdock playing spas
modically, with spurts of his old-time
\u25a0form, but in the main falling much below
his usual standard of play and on!y at
brief intervals doing himself -Justice, He
pained a lead even larger than In the
first set, running up to 5-2 and 40-15, but
being unable to gain the point necessary
to give him the set. Gardner, while his
opponent was vainly striving for this
needed point, showed his best play in the
\u25a0whole match, sweeping all- before -him
and taking five games and the set by the
came score with which he won the first.
ing the score 4-1 in his favor. Then he
fell off in his play, while Gardner hung
on gamely and, playing his usual steady,
careful game, pulled up to even terms,
losing the ninth, after which he came on
again and was never heaoed, taking the
next three games and the set with a score
of 7-5. ._:::: ,:.xi_ . -/'H

A new tennis champion stepped Into the
limelight yesterday, when Carl Gardner
*-on the championship of San Francisco,
symbolized by the J. r>. Grant cup. from
Percy Myrdock In the finals, of the an
nual tournament ax the California Tennis
Club courts. Gardner's victory was un
expected,- as few of the large number of
spectators present thought at the tapgin
ninjr of yesterday's play that he had any
thing better than a desperate chance to
win. The opening brace of games con
firmed the. expectation that Murdock
would retain the trophy which he won In
such gallant style last year.
He started to make a runaway of .It.

the third after a long deuce contest and

'Z_\ em attitude : has been' a "decline in
(;â¢ *\u25a0 superannuation." It, is hot : that peo
ple live longer? oh I the average than they
once didâ a disputed point of vital statls
. ticsâ but that [ they ; live longer j during a
normal life in maintaining. activity of in
\tereBt up to the last. -This is evident, de
spite ;an and , perhaps â¢ growing
tendency to impese an age. limit of forty
in more strenuous physical service, whera
under pressure of competition full bodily
vigor is required for. efficiency. In. social
life notably, the'peculiar .badges "and dis
tinctions of age are increasingly discard

strings! and a neckerchief .the -inevitable
book ! or . workbag. in : her lap. conversation
with her .-.being. supposed to be 'concerned
principally with "what she did when she
was a girl " It is this type a social chron
icler pictures for us in an account of. a
reception given hi New York about sixty
years; ago to the .."venerable" widow of
Chancellor Kenti : a \u25a0 vigorous and alert
woman of 70 years.' who "sat in a chair
of state in- one f ; corner of the drawing
room all the evening.; The guests. Includ
ing many notables of the day, pa!i]Lthc,ir.
respects : to . her, exchanged a. few, words
and then withdrew." -This; conformed to
what was then the ritual'- of lif 3-^-to pay
ceremonious \ deference ]to Cage nccordtng
to an arbitrary 'distinction of birthdays.
This change Jin social attitude

the {changed -actual attitude, the attitude
of I encourageVhentUo continued 'activity, in

T"^ IRE LESS stoves were made the subject of an address by Mrs.
I""*' Back of Frankfort, Germany, 1 delivered to*- an audience cpn
. â¢ . sisting largely of ; working people, and synoptically reported
by our Consul at that place in. the' latest number of the Consular
Reports. Mrs. Back is the wife of the director of the industrial
school at Frankfort, and she has been using the hay box or fircless
stove for thirteen years, and has found it so greatly reduces. her
household cares she recommends it for general use.- As an article
of kitchen furniture it is not only a convenience, but effects a large
economy in fuel, -^^ ;?; :
This hay box stove consists of ja wooden box lined with hay or
any isolating material to prevent the escape of heat, and fitted wtih
a tight door. It was while making use of the box \u25a0-merely for the
purpose of keeping food warm ; that Mrs. Back discovered that "if
the pots were taken from the gas stove and inclosed while boiling
hot in the heat preserving hay box the process ;of cooking would
continue, and so save the waste of any. further fuel/ â¢
The scientific explanation of this surprising fact is that unless
pots are hermetically sealed our food in cooking is never subjected
to more than 212 Farenheit, or boiling point of water, no matter how
much fuel we 'consume or how long we keep the material on the
stove. It follows that if that amount of heat is once developed it
is only necessary to prevent the escape of heat and the process of
cooking goes on: A tight box made of thick wood and packed with
hay around the sides has been found effective for that purpose.
The articles of diet that can be finished in. this way- are all
boiled and roasted meats, sauces, fish, soup and vegetables, fruit .'.-'and'
puddings. It is not expected to cook everything: in this way, but to
use the box as supplemental. Most articles should remainin the
box two or three hours. In the preparatory cooking on the gas
stove, vegetables . require but two or three minutes' boiling,, but
roast meats should have twenty or thirty minutes. .! Some of the
principal advantages are that the â¢ cost of^ fuel ' can be reduced : four
fifths to nine-tenths; the food is betterVcopkwk 'fmpreVtasty.ran(ltnt[S
tritious; time and labor are sayed; no stirring is necessary, anil
there's no fear of scorching or burning; and where 'various members
of the family take their meals at "difi^erent times the food may be
taken from the -box warm, freshly cooked, [at any . hour of the day.
ECONOMICAL COOKING.
Conditions on this coast continue cheerful. Tacbma and
Seattle bank clearings in May broke all' previous records. The
wholesale lumber trade is reported in very good condition. Crop
prospects as a rule are first-class. Here in California the leading
grains and fruits, hops, wool, dairy products, etc., are enjoying very
firm and active markets, with stocks of everything reduced to
almost nothing and quotations away above the normal. There are
no clouds in the cemmercial sky of the Pacific Coast.
Against these apparently adverse factors, howevef, we have
what is of vast and indeed overshadowing importance and on which
the prosperity of the country largely depends, most excellent crop
prospects. Wheat, corn and cotton are all looking well, though
they would look betteY with warmer weafher. This is especially
the case with cotton, the condition of which is. given by the Gov
ernment report just issued at 77.2, as compared with 74.1 on the
corresponding date last j'ear and a ten-year average of 80.3. The
total acreage planted up to May 25 was about 28,120,000 acres, a
decrease of about 3,610,000 acres or 11.4 per cent from last yean
The report was bearish, as it showed a higher crop condition and
a smaller decrease in acreage than had been, figured on by. statis
ticians and the larger market operators, and it immediately broke
the cotton market.
The money market shows no new features, funds being plenti
ful and interest rates moderate everywhere. It' is estimated that
Eastern industrial corporations will pay out in dividends this
month $18,000,000, as compared with $15,600,000 in June,. 1904.
The- heaviest disbursement of this will be $8,775,000 by the Stand
ard Oil Company.
rpHE country has now had some weeks of practically unchang
1 ing trade conditions. From all sections come cheerful reports,
* the only unfavorable conditions being the . abnormally cool and
wet weather, which has set back the season and interfered more
or less with the usual distribution of goods and the early summer
trade. Still; in spite of this drawback,' the business of the \u25a0country
continues to expand beyond the normal increase' in population, and
as there is not much speculation, the current conditions are most
excellent and creative of continued confidence in the future.
The larger cities and towns continue to show' increasing bank
clearings, attestive of the growing volume of general business. For
ihe past several years weekly clearings of $2,000,000,000 constituted
the normal, but this index number must now be increased to about
$2,500,000,000. In especially active weeks, particularly during
periods of excitement on the New York Stock Exchange, they run
up over $3,000,000,000, while during the occasional lulls they fall
to about the old figure of $2,000,000,000. Anything below this in
dicates dullness. The figure last week was $2,240,000,000/ and it
is smaller than for some weeks, with one or two exceptions some
little time back. Still, the gain in percentage over 1904, when, it
will be remembered, the spring trade was quiet, was 42.2 per cent,
and most of the very large cities exhibited high expansions, such as
62.3 at New York, 32.9 at Pittsburg, 49.8 at Minneapolis, 12.6 at
Chicago, 18.2 at Boston, 26.1 at Philadelphia, 17.5 at San Francisco,
and so on. *
These cities form the clearing points of the stock markets
and great financial operations, the iron and steel, flour, grain and
provision, footwear, cotton woolen and general textile industries,,
and their clearings are therefore good indexes of the volume and
character of business throughout the country. If not infallible they
are very near it. And when almost every large city and town
from one coast to the other shows a continued gain week after week
the only. reasonable deduction is that business must be correspond
ingly increasing all over the land. Such is the current situation
to-day.
There are, however, certain signs which will bear watching.
For instance, there was a report last week from Pittsburg that
many mills of the United States Steel Corporation would shortly
be closed for the purpose of diminishing the production of iron and
steel products. This is not a good sign, and though the report
elicits a smile from the leaders of this great industry, it is reiterated
with a persistence which attracts more or less attention. Then
there is continued tameness in the provision trade, though this line
cannot be called dull, and in fact has exhibited more firmness dur
ing the past few days. Talk of tariff revision and the fixing of rail
road rates by the Government is also having some effect on the
stock market and influencing the movements of the great financial
interests. The occasional collapse of a bank through reckless, not
to say criminal, speculation on the part of its officers is another
feature of the times. These modern banking disasters have been
too frequent of late.

CLU3 rARTIES.
To locate the mine fields constitutes an
other problem. ' For j some weeks j the * ar
tillery has had four boats planting mines.
These mines are not loaded, but construc
tively they will be Jus t as dangerous to
the | navy as though they "contained^ex
plosives : unless located and ' > destroyed
through countermining operations. - Dur
ing these operations also -the artillery of
the fortresses , will > play. on, the vessels.*
-"When these exercises -have^.beenVcon
cluded before . one " set * of ', defenses, V; the
actors ' will ; move: to" another, '\u25a0 and ' should
Fort Monroe be ; the first point of at
tack, as is anticipated.! the conclusion of
the programme there, will be followed by
the same \ operations against the ! forts
nearer Washington and Baltimore. :
The operation of the defenses are un
der the general supervision of Major Gen
eral James F. Wade/ commanding the De
partment of the Atlantic. The- men and
officers : under ' him ''\u25a0 for the ; exercises will
number nearly! 10,000. 'Â«, ; I
Tabulated observations of what, haa
been accomplished, on each . side are , to
be made by the ' umpires and observers.
On each ship. will be a naval umpire and
an artillery, observer and in each fortress
will be an artillery "umpire and a\ naval
observer. None of the big : guns of the
navy will : be fired,' neither, will the big
guns of the fortifications be heard. These
guns on both .' sides. - however, -. will be
trained on" the target the same as In
actual* war, Vand ' their : fire / will " be indi
cated by the discharge of . a blank cart
ridge in a one-pounder.
. It is explained that? the night attacks
are to ascertain the efficiency of. the
searchlights of the fortifications and also
to give the navy exercises in construc
tively making these HghtÃ dark. To ren
der this more effective the ships of the
pquadron have been painted " four colors.
The Texas, : Newark, '\ Atlanta-, Terror,
Hornet, Siren and Sylvia are white; the
Florida; ~ Arkansas, Nevada, . war color;
the Hartford black, and the torpedo-boat
destroyers dark green. Artillery, flre will
be . directed on the ships as they are
picked up by. the", lights, but 1 for this ex
ercise the mines are hot regarded j as in
existence.
Anchor is to be weighed on June 5 and
from then on : a fascinating game of hide
and seek will be indulged Jn between the
artillery and the navy. \ ;
MUST LOCATE THE MINES.
In the present instance the object of
each of the' several 'forms of -attacks
by the navy will. be. to demonstrate the
strength or weakness of some partic
ular phase of the defense.
From the Information obtainable, the
programme first. contemplates the test
of Fort -\u25a0'\u25a0 Monroe. Expert v artillery
opinion has long held that^thlsjfortress
is the principal, defense of the Chesa
peak and consequently, the, cities of
Washington ana Baltimore. '
The hostile fleet has been assembled
under- the command of Rear Admiral
Francis W. Dlckins, who, with his flag
ship, the Texas, is lying at -Annapolis.
On the 10th of June Admiral, Dlckins
will hold his last communlction .with
shore. -He will not dtvulge his plans
or place of his attack, but it !s the cup
position that he will put to sea, hav
ing technically established ;a. base at
Norfolk. His squadron^ consists of the

r ASHINGTON, June: 4.-^ Sixteen
warships will attack the defenses .of
Washing-ton and Baltimore at midnight
on June 11 and^continue their offensive
operations for six: days,; and nigrhtsJ
Meanwhile the fortresses { along: Chesa
pealce Bay and the Potomac Ri ver, con

which they are_ capable. With it "all.

ular, and intensely Interesting only to
the army and navy experts who are
playing 1 , tha-game and know the con
structive effect \u25a0of the unloaded mines
and the empty shells. .
The exercises- are, to ; constitute : the
only joint operations of the army and
navy during the year..'- They, have been
designated J'Joint exercises"; to dis
tinguish; them, from the more elaborate
"combined army and | navy" maneuvers,
which were" first planned but which
faJledpf approval for; lack of an ade
quate, appropriation, from Congress.
The operations are to be conducted
under, rules which have been agreed
upon by a joint .. board l of army and
navy officers. Considerable importance
Is attached to the distinction between
maneuvers and joint exercises.
Maneuvers are held, to apply to oper
ations where actual war conditions are
simulated, while exercises mean only
that certain prescribed problems are to
be attempted.

An Oakland lady who has a taste for
good literature tells what a happy
time she bad on "The Road to Well-
\-Hle-" She Bays: â¢
â¢I drank coffee freely for eight years
before I began to perceive any evil ef-
fects from it. Then I noticed that I
\u25a0was becoming- very nervous, â¢ and that
my 6tomach was gradually losing- the
power to properly assimilate my food.
In time I got so weak that I dreaded
to leave the house â for no reason
whatever but because of the miserable
condition of my nerves and stomach. I
attributed the trouble to anything In
tho world but coffee, of course. I
dosed myself with medicines, which in
the end would leave me in a worse
condition than at first. I was most
wretched and discouraged â not 30
years old and feeling that life was a
failure!
"I had given up all hope of ever en-
joying myself like other people, till
one day I read the* little book "The
Road to'Wellvillc." It opened my eyes,
and taught me a lesson I shall never
forget and cannot value too highly. I
immediately .Quit the use of the old
-kind of roffee and began rto drink Pos-
tum 'Food Coffee. I noticed. the begin-
ning of an Iraproi-ement. in the whole
tone of my By? tern, after only two days
,nÂ»c cf the, new drink, and in a very
Â«.-.ort time" realized that I could go
about like other people without the
leaFt return of the nervous dread that
formerly gave me so much, trouble.; In
fa.ct ,my nervousness disappeared en-
tirely and has never returned, although
It .Is now a year that I havo been
drinking Postum Food Coffee. And my:
Ftoraach Is now like â¢Ironâ- nothing can
upf=et it!
"I>aBt week, during the big Conclave
in San Francisco. 1 was on the go day!
and night without the slightest- .fa- :
tigue; and as I stood in the immense
crowd watching the great parade that
lasted for hours I thought -.t0.- myself.
This strength is ' what Postum Food
Coffee tins given , me!' " Name given by
Postura Co., Battle Creek, Mich.
There's a reason. . .

*Ule" may be found In every pke. \u25a0 â¢

Unless Mate Moon organizes an expedi
tion 'with "Calif ornia Charley" as; min
ing engineer and assayer, no goldhunter
is likely to . start from" iiis part of the
world for the Moon" mine at, the bottom
of the Straits of Magellan.. . . . .fi ~
. Now comes Lijghtship No. 76. The "Cap
tain"' Moon of -the dispatch occupies the
modest position of, mate and !s not taken
very seriously -on board the lightship.
Captain Qulnton ; was ; disclaiming all
knowledge 'yesterday of ; having discov
ered'any gold during his .long voyage
' from Atlantic ,to \u25a0 Pacific when the noise
of a ioud voice filled the lightship's din
ing-ealoon ] and * overflowed * into the com
mander's quarters. ;
. "I'm - the Moon that caused the excite
ment Izt| the newspapers," bellowed the
voice," and it's all true."
Then a form In keeping, with the vocal
; effort* suddenly: appeared,:: eclipsing the
sun and darkening the cabin as his bulky
and opaque:, body came "to rest in, front
of several port holes. â¢ \u25a0.'*\u25a0 v
\u2666"I'm the- Moon," he repeated, giving his
superior officer a . look which ,on â¢ most
ships would Have led to the speedy, ap
pointment of a new mate. But Captain
Quinton merely smiled a tired ernlle.
Moon; acknowledged himself the author
of the letter to Baltimore and vowed that
what he saw was gold because "California
Charley" told him so. The anchor, with
its alleged coat, was dropped a
few seconds after It emerged from the
depths. When raised later there _ was
sticking to it nothing but common or sea
garden mud." "".
"California Charley," who recognized
the precious metal, is a sailor, on the
lightship. He is a- native soji of;Swe
deri:'\u25a0":\u25a0 In the lightship's 'forecastle, be
tween mouthfuls of iSea; pie, \he yes
terday -confirmed: Moon's Btory. He
was >rithin r , twenty, feet of the anchor,
he said.- and \u25a0 saw, most distinctly sev
eral: shining " particles of'; ffloutr t gold In
the v niud- tftat : was brought up' by v' the
anchor. . He knew lt^ was gold, he said,
because he once made a trip to Alaska
and he' guesses he. ought to know a thing
or two about gold. .
r* "Didn't J ' tell â¢ you?" said Moon.
Lightship Xo. 76. the source of the mar
velous tale" of ' gold r which,^ starting: /from
Baltimore, has been -] making the' rounds
of the press of. the -."world.", arrived, yes
terday with the author on board.
substance of the dispatch was to the ef
fect that Captain Moon! of Ldghtshlp' Ncv
76, in a - letter : to .'. a . friend 'in Baltimore,"
"had reported that; while in the Straits
of Magellan the vessel had ; anchored and
the anchor, when raised, was found to be
plated with gold. The dispatch added
that , numerous expeditions were fitting
'out and soon would be , on ' the scene of
the r=asy money, harvesting the bed of the

Explains Boat Mlsnap.
The young ladies who had charge of
the dance on the British ship Kynance
Friday evening in Oakland Creek are
much perturbed over the newspaper
reports of the lack of accommodations
for. the guests and their inability to
get home that night. Miss Mildred
.Burnett, who was one of the leading
spirits- in arranging for the festival,
claims that it was not the fault of the
committees that better provisions were
not made for the merrymakers. She
asserts that the unexpected crowd
coming late as 10 o'clock through a
misunderstanding of- s the invitational
committees necessitated a change "of
plans and that a number of warnings
were given the dancers that they roust
lÂ«!;ave early in order to get a train to
San Francisco.
