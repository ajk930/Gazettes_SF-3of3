POLICE UNABLE TO GIVE PROTECTION
NEW YORK, Jan. 16âAlarmed by
the Increasing boldness of highway
men, thieves and burglars, who have
become so daring of late that the
homes of wealthy men have been en

TACOMA, Jan. 16.âThe once brown
locks cf M. A. Mahohey, who brought
from Fairbanks to Valdez the body of
former Mayor Humes or Seattle, are
now white, as the result of his experi
ence with timber wolves during his
trip.
It was Mahoney's custom to leave the
box containing Hume's body on the
trail while he and his dogs each night
entered the nearby timber to build a
lire and sleep. As the sun was setting
one evening they heard the howls of a
large pack of timber wolves, which
gradually closed in around them.
Hauling the body into the timber,
Mahoney built a fire, and his dogs,
frightened and nervous, crept between
the sled and the Are. moaning their
fear throughout the long night. When
ever the fire grew "low the wolves came
closer.
Mahoney's fight was largely against
his own sleepiness. For safety he tied
a pine knot, burning, to his arm, and
when it burned close enough to hurt he
would get up and replenish the fire.
He was compelled to thus torture him
self three successive nights. # On the

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 16.âDr. Samuel
M. Woodbridge, director of the agricul
tural experiment station of the South
ern California Academy of Sciences and
an agricultural chemist of note, has
been arrested on two charges of assault
with intent to commit murder. The
complaints are sworn to by Mrs. Eunice
Groome, his mother-in-law, who claims
that Woodbridge made four attempts
to kill her on the night of December 31,
190 M.
The cases will develop a sensational
scandal, Woodbridge claiming that his
wife, who has brought a suit for divorce
in San Jose, has been on too friendly
terms with Justice Glover of South
Pasadena, before whom one of the com
plaints was sworn to. An attempt will
be made to have the divorce case trans
ferred to Los Angeles, and a motion to
dismiss the assault case before Justice
Glover on the ground of bias will be
made.
Intermingled with the legal action
that has been taken in connection with
the scandal are two suits for the fore
closure of mortgages on property
owned by' Woodbridge brought by Mrs.
Groome, and the arrest of M. W.
Groome, son of Mrs. Groome, on a
charge of committing battery on the
person of Woodbridge.
Juiftlce Glover indignantly denies
Woodbridge's insinuations regarding
the conduct of Mrs. Woodbridge. Mrs.
Woodbridge also denies every allega
tion. The case is the ugliest and most
complicated of Its kind brought here In
years. All the persons are well known.

SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, JANUARY 17, 1905.
BIG STRIKE,
INVOLVING
300,000 MEN
German Coal Miners
Have Determined
to Walk Out.
Great Concern Felt as to
tlie Consequences to
the Empire.
Troops Euihed to the Scene, but
Unions, Themselves, Will Help
to Preserve Order,
BERLIN. Jan. I.7.âThe strike of coal
miners, which broke out yesterday, is
the most formidable affair of the kind
that Germany has ever had. There had
been no serious trouble in the coal in
dustry since the strike of ISS9, but this
strike far eclipses the one alluded to,
all labor organizations taking part,
whereas in 1899 only the Socialist
unions were concerned. The present
movement has been largely engineered
by the so-cailed Christian unions,
which otherwise oppose the Socialist
element.
Commercial and financial classes are
greatly concerned lest the strike should
arrest Germany's recuperation from
the effects of the crisis of 1901, since it
is certain that enforced idleness will
follow la many other industries unless
the strike is speedily settled. The
Government, too, is deeply concerned,
and the Ministry is keeping the'wires
busy in communicating with the mili
tary and police authorities in the min
ing country.
Chancellor yon Buknv had a long
consultation on Monday In the Diet
with a Government Commissioner, who
had just returned froÂ» Dortmund.
The miners' .mating tp decide the
question of a strike tested less than
ten minutes and the decision to order
a strike of 300,000 men was made with
out further discussion.
It is evident that the organized min
ers Intend to conduct the strike in
strict obedience to the laws and so
win the sympathy of the people, but
there is a fear that individual strikers
may resort to exceaeea. The leaders
at to-day's meeting warned the dele
gates against molesting strike break
ers, and it was decided to organize a
police force of miners to assist the
authorities in maintaining order.
Nevertheless the Government Is tak
ing comprehensive precautions to pre
vent rioting. One regiment at Dussel
dorf already has received orders to
proceed to the mining district and an ~
other regiment at Deutz. near Cologne,
Is moving, while others at Cologne and
\Wisel are held in readiness to march
at a moment's notice. â¢
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 16.âThe,
strike begun to-day in the Putiloff
Iron Works is the result of the re
fusal of the manager to reinstate four
workmen who were dismissed for be
longing to a union and to discharge a
foreman on demands formulated by
the union, which represents twenty in
dustries. The works are idle in all de
partments.
The Putiloff Iron Works are execut
ing large Government contracts for
small arms, rapid-fire cannon and lo
comotives, which fact probably will in
duce the authorities to make an effort
for adjustment of the difficulties be
tween the workmen and their employ
ers.

ROSSEAU'S
PLOT FAILS
IN SEATTLE
Dynamiter Has a
. Record on This
Coast.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE. Jan. 16.âGessler Ros
seau, now under arrest in Philadel
phia, constructed an infernal machine
in Seattle about three years ago. The
machine was at the time found by the
police in a blacksmith shop, where
some work was being done on it. It
Is believed that the dynamiter intend
ed to blow up one of the Pacific liners
sailing from this port.
For several days Rosseau was shad
owed and it was learned that he was
making another similar machine. He
became aware that he was beln%
watched and disappeared. The ma
chine which he first made is still in
Seattle. It consists of a leadpipe
capped at each end and containing a
piston which is driven with great force
against nitro-glycerine which is placed
in one end of the pipe. Detective
Sergeant Arthur Carey of New York,
was in Seattle looking for Rosseau
soon after the Infernal machine was
found, but got no trace of his where
abouts.
NEW YORK. Jan. 16.âPolice offi
cials in this city hope to have posses
sion of Gessler Rosseau, now under
arrest in Philadelphia, by the middle
of the week. Inspector McClusky, chief
of the Dective Bureau, asserts that he
has sufficient evidence in the Umbria
infernal machine affair to convict Ros
seau of a felony and send him to pris
on for a ten-year term. The inspec
tor believes also that he can connect
Rosseau with the mysterious disap
pearance some years ago of the steam
ship Naronlc, in which many Uvea
were lost.
The disappearance of the steamship
Naronlc was one of the mysteries of
the Atlantic. She was a freighter with
nearly 100 men aboard and sailed in
February, 1893, from Liverpool for
New York. The vessel was only one
year old.
From the day she cleared the Mer
sey no trace of ber was found. In the
fail of 1893 a Norwegian bark, when
several hundred miles southwest of the
Azores, picked up parts of the wreck
age of what was believed to be one
of the liner's lifeboats. Again in the
summer of 1896 the fate of the Naro
nlc was recalled when a boatman pick
ed up in the Irish channel a bottle that
contained a note as follows:
"Struck iceberg; sinking fast; Naro
ni c> YOUNG."
Few persons believed the bottled
message was genuine.
PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 16. âSeveral
physicians, prominent as alientists,
visited Rosseau in his cell to-day to
determine his mental condition. Ros
seau was not told of the errand of the
visitors, but was left to Infer that they
were detectives. After the examina
tion the physicians withdrew and told
Captain of Detectives Donaghy that
Rosseau was perfectly sane upon all
points except anarchy and dynamiting.
Trainmen Will Not Strike.
PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 16. âUnof-
ficial returns from the vote cast by
the Brotherhood of .Railway Train
men employed by the Pennsylvania
Railroad indicate that there will be
no strike.

BURBANK'S
LATEST FIND
Everlasting Flower
Arouses Cupidity
of Dealers.
Special Dispatch to The Call
SANTA ROSA, Jan. 16.âSince the
publication to the world of the develop
ment of the everlasting and fadeless
flower by Luther BurbanK that gentle
man has received a number of flatter
ing offers for that creation. As the
flower has not yet been developed to
the full satisfaction of the wizard of
horticulture he has refused to sell it.
In the future, when his ideal of per
fection has been realized, Burbank will
dispose of his remarkable creation.
Not only have the offers to purchase
this new creation come by the dozen
from this country, but three firm! in
England have endeavored to obtain the
exclusive right to the flower. A firm
in France and another in South Amer
ica have, also made offers. Several of
the firms that wish the flower have
stated that their desire for it Is due
to the fact that it probably will revo
lutionize the millinery business by pro
viding an everlasting trimming for
women's hats.
Burbank himself believes the fadeless
flower will be principally used for the
adornment of feminine headdress, but
he says as the ladies are so changeable
he does not recommend the flower for
that particular purpose.
Each of the three English Arms that
have written to Burbank desires to
handle the novelty exclusively on the
continent and the offers for the fade
less flower are considered fairly liberal
by the originator. Burbank's custom,
however, is never to permit one of his
creations to leave his premises until
its condition is perfect from his point
cf view.

Nations.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 16.âSecretary
Hay is preparing a reply to the Rus
sian note charging the Chinese Gov
ernment with persistent violations of
neutrality, which will have an Im
portant bearing on the war and prob
ably will arouse as much interest
among the powers as did his call upon
them to preserve the "administrative
entity" of China by limiting the zone
of hostilities. That Hay himself at
taches much importance to the com
munication is proved by the fact that
he is preparing it in the privacy of
his. home, where he disposes of all great
questions. He was not at the State
Department on Saturday or to-day, but
he is keeping in tlose touch with the
developments in the situation and fre
quently sends for documents or other
information bearing upon it. While
the note has not been completed and
may not be for several days, its pur
port has been decided upon.
Hay will champion the cause of
China as vigorously as in his first note
to the powers. He will not admit that
there have been any intentional viola
tions of neutrality, but will maintain
that the Government in Peking has
exerted itself to preserve a strictly
proper attitude. Admitting that there
may have been some transgressions of
propriety by Chinese who could not
be controlled, he will suggest to the
Czar that his own troops have violated
the agreement to limit the war zone
by invading Chinese territory. Tlje
Cossack raid east of the Shakhe River
and other instances which have been
reported to the State Department will
be referred to. 1
In the Interest of the peace of Eu
rope Hay will ask the Czar to regard
the attitude of the Chinese Government
rather than the acts of individuals and
to adhere to the agreement by which
the field of hostilities was limited. Hay
will call Russia's attention to the dif
ficulty of the Government in
holding in check \ a enormous popula
tion, thousands of whom are ready to
side with whichever belligerent seems
t<< have an advantage.
Copies of the note will be sent to all
the powers and the other governments
are expected to interpret It as an ap
peal to them to exert moral pressure
!n St. Petersburg to prevent the Czar
violating the agreement which waa
suggested by Hay. That this action
will be taken by some of the powers
already is Indicated.
Japan has protested against the in
vasion of Chinese territory by the Rus
sians and is preparing a sharp reply
to the Russian rlote. England and Ger
many are keeping in touch with what
this Government is doing and prepar-
ing to do. " Sir Mortimer Durand, the
British Embassador, and Baron Bus
sone, the German Charge d'Affalres,
were at the State Department to-day
and went over the subject with Acting
Secretary Loomis. Takahira, the Jap
anese Minister, also was a State De
partment caller to-day.
POWERFUL
FOES FIGHT
HARRIMAN
Union Pacific Con
trol the Prize
at Stake.
6pecial Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK. Jan. 16.âWall street
heard the rumor to-day that J.
pont Morgan and James J. Hill were
secretly conspiring to obtain control of
the Union Pacific from Harrlman and
Rockefeller, in retaliation for the lat
ter's grab of Northern Pacific stock.
Many facts in connection with the
rumor appear suggestive. The most
important is the steady rise in the
price of Union Pacific, from 71 to 120,
in the face of the determined efforts
of the Harriman party to depress it.
Only within the last ten days have
Harriman and his friends ceased to
throw large blocks of stock on the
market in the hope of breaking it.
It is now believed, even in the Union
Pacific offices, that the mysterious per
sons who have taken all -this stock
were working for Morgan and Hill.
There is much nervousness where
Harriman has his office. His friends
believe Hill and Morgan will at least
get enough stock to demand the re
tirement of Harriman from his present
Czarlike control.

STATE LEGISLATURE
SOLONS' PLANS FOR LONG JAUNT
ARE NIPPED IN THE BUD.
DISASTER OVERTAKES SCHEME
OF WOULD-BE INVESTIGATORS
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 16.âThe storm
broke in the Senate this morning. Sen
ator Savage and a few of his- friends,
believing that the time for junketing
had arrived, presented a resolution
providing for an exhilarating tour to
the southland. But the howl that went
up fairly took the breath of the propo
nents of the measure and before the
clock had ticked off fifteen minutes
Senator Savage threw up his hands In
despair and withdrew the document.
In withdrawing it, however, he made it
known that he was inspired to present
it by a desire to do his fullest duty to
the State, but his inspiration had been
succeeded by that which evidently
dominated the upper house, and
henceforth he could be counted among
the opponents of every junketing pian
that could even be dreamed of.
The prayer of the chaplain had just
concluded when the members of the
Senate were thrown into verbal com
bat by Savage's resolution, which fol
lows:
. Kesolvtrd, That a select committee, consist
ing of Senators Coggins, Welch, McKce, Muen
ter. Nelson, Markey. Pendleton. Woodward,
Baur, Savage and French, representing th?
fallowing standing corrrnittees in the Senate,
to wit: Prisons and reformatories, hospitals
and asylums ami finance, be and they are
hereby granted a leave of absence for one
week for the purpose of visiting the State
School at Whittier, the Normal School at Los
Angeles, the State Hospital at Patton, the
Normal School at San Francisco, and the
Normal School and querantine station at San
Diego, in order that the needs of these various
Institutions may be thoroughly inquired into
and repdrted upon to the Senate. And the said
committee be and they are hereby allowed
their expenses actually Incurred upon said
vlelt.
VIGOROUS OPPOSITION.
When the reading of the resolution
was concluded the members of the
Senate sat for a moment gazing at one
another, the majority in amazement.
Then Senator Carter arose, and with a
confused expression on his face said
that if the measure was going to be
. adopted he would like to be counted in
for the trip. Then Senator Shortridge
started.
â¢ "We are now getting down to busi
ness," he said, "and it is with some
uneasiness that I contemplate this
new-fangled committee that has select
ed itself to visit some nine Institutions
and travel some 4000 miles to do it.
While I will admit that there are some
millions of dollars in the treasur-y that
only awaits our grasping hands, I can
not see why I should support such a
resolution when I glance around and
see these threadbare carpets and
dusty seats. There are no flowers on
my desk, and cheer has fled from the
Senate chamber. While this fact re
mains I can see no excuse for these
junketing trips."
Shortridge had barely concluded be
fore Wolfe was on his feet to support
the measure. "Senator Shortridge al
ways raises objections to these meas
ures," said Wolfe, "but when the time
comes he forgets his effort at oratory
and votes in favor of them."
Senator Timpson next took the floor
and moved that the resolution be sent
to the committee on Contingent Ex
penses for further consideration, but
the motion was lost sight of when
Belshaw arose to support the stand
taken by Shortridge. "I am a mem
ber of the Finance Committee," said
Belshaw, "and so far as I am aware
this committee does not desire to be
represented on the junketing commit
tee. We have not met as yet, and
while I admit that the junketers prob
ably would have a good time and
would be well entertained, I doubt, as
we have not discussed the question,
that the Finance Committee would
agree that the results of this junket
would be commensurate with the ex
pense to the State."
RESOLUTION WITHDRAWN.
Then Senator Ralston took a hand.
"I am opposed to this resolution on
the ground that those that favor It
are going about things in the wrong
way," he said. "Let the various in

and explain their needs. Then the
committees can determine what trips
are necessary and what action should
be taken to Investigate them."
This was enough for Savage and he
decided it was time to quit. With a
slight display of temper he said:
' I had no Idea this resolution was
going to create such a rumpus. But
in answer to those that have opposed
my measure I want to say that we
have obtained sufficient information
regarding the institutions named In
the resolution to warrant a viait there.
There is that murder at Napa that
needs looking into and then the infor
mation comes that the foundation of
the State Normal School at Los Ange
les is giving way and any minute the
building may come tumbling down.
There is no institution in, the State
that does not need Investigation. How
ever, I will yield to this unlocked for
display of opposition and withdraw my
motion, but not until after I have made
it known to you all that I will oppose
to the end any similar resolution that
may be presented during this session
of the Legislature."
Permission to withdraw the resolu
tion was granted Senator Savage and,
after those that had opposed it had
shaken hands over their victory, the
first clash of the session was at an
end.
AGAINST THE BOYCOTT.
; Among the important measures in
; troduced at this morning's session was
one by Senator Ralston against boy
cotting and blacklisting. The meas
ure is as follo%vs:
To prohibit boycr tting, unfair lists, picket
ing or other interference with the lawful busi
i ness or occupation of others, and to provide
a penalty therefor.
The people of the State of California, rep
res -jited in Senate and Assembly, do enact as
follows:
Section Iâlt shall be unlawful for two or
more persons to conspire together for the pur
pose of preventing any person, persons, firm,
association or corporation from carrying on
any lawful business within the State of Cali
fornia, or for the purpose of interfering with
the same.
Section 2âThat it shall be unlawful for any
person or persons to go near to or loiter about
the premises or place of business of any per
son, firm, association or corporation engaged
in a lawful business, for the purpose of influ
encing or inducing others not to trade with
buy from, sell to or have business dealings
with such person, firm, association or corpo
ration, or to picket the works or place of
business of such other person, firm, association
or corporation for the purpose of Interfering
with or injuring any lawful business or enter
prise: provided, that nothing herein shall pre
vent any person from soliciting trade or busi
ness for a competitive business.
Section 3âThat it shall be unlawful to print
or circulate any notice of boycott, boycott
cards, stickers, dodgers or unfair lists, pub
lishing or declaring that a boycott or ban ex
ists or has existed or is contemplated against
any person, firm, association or corporation

Section sâThat it shall be unlawful for any
person, firm, association or corporation to
maintain a blacklist, or to notify any other
person, firm, association or corporation that
any person has been blacklisted by such per

any other similar means to prevent such per
son from receiving employment.
Section 6âAny person, firm, association,
corporation or any officer thereof violating any
provision of this act Is guilty of a misde
meanor.
Section 7âAll acts and parts of acts in con
flict with the provisions of this act are hereby
repealed.
Section BâThis act shall take effect and be
in force from and after Its passage and ap
proval.
Regarding this bill Senator Ralston
said:
"This bill is not aimed at any union
or corporation, but is Intended to coV
r*ct many abuses. Its provision relat
ing to blacklisting will prove of ben
efit, in fact, to the laboring men that
are put under the ban by corporations,
and it enables men so injured to pro
cure redress in the criminal courts, as
it permits of the arrest of officers of
corporations that violate its provisions.

SACRAMENTO. Jan. 16.âFrank P. |
Flint of Los Angeles may be the last
of the United States Senators from
California to be elected by direct vote
of the Legislature. To-morrow morn
ing Senator J. B. Sanford of Ukiah
will present a bill placing In the hands
of the voters the right to name in gen
eral the candidates for this
high office. The bill is based off the
Oregon ar.d Wisconsin laws and so
worded as to avoid the provisions of
the Congressional measure relating to
the manner in which United States
Senators shall be elected and the
articles of the constitution of Califor
nia bearing upon the same â  subject.
The bill is as follows:
An act to enabli the people of the State of
California to -xtress by ballot their preieience j
lor some person for the office of United States
Senator. The people of the State cf California, ,
represented in Senate and Assembly, do enact
as fallows: i
Section IâAt all general elections next pre
ceding the election of a Senator in Congress
by the Legislature of Callrornia there shall be
placed upon the official ballot by each of the
county clerks the names of all candidates for
the office of Senator in Congress that have
been nominated In any of the methods now or
which may hereafter be provided by law for
the nomination of State officers of the State or
California, the votes for which candidates shall
be counted and certified Ij Dy the election offi
cers ,in<tfte same manner as the votes for other 1
candidates, and records of the votes for such
candidates shall be made out and sworn to
by the Board of Election Oi fleers of each county
of the State and returned to the Secretary of !
State, who shall transmit duplicate copies of I
such returns to the Legislature at its next en- j
suing session, one of which shall be addressed i
to the Senate and the other to the Assembly of I
the State of California, one copy of which
â hall be delivered by him to the President of i
the Senate and the other to the Speaker of the ;
Assembly, after the c.raanizaiion of such bod- I
les, which OtScars shall open and
lay the same before the separate
houses . when assembled to elect a
Senator in Congress as now required by law of j
Congress, and it shall be the duty of each !
house to count the votes and announce the j
candidate for Senator having the highest num. '
ber, and thereupon the House shall proceed to '
the election of a Senator as required by the i
act of Congress and the constitution of this t
State.
" For many years citizens of various
States have tried to secure the consent
of Congress to change the existing law,"
said Senator Sanford, "but they have
failed, the Senate always objecting,
each Senator probably taking into full
consideration the potency of the sys
tem that enabled him to secure his
election. The bill I have prepared is
based on the laws of Oregon and Wis
consin that have successfully with
stood attack, and while It .does not
absolutely hold each legislator to vote
for the candidate of bis party certified
under Its provisions to both houses it
does so morally and It would be a
nervy man Indeed that would dare to
go behind the vote of the people and
cast It aside as not binding.
"Under this act each political party
win nominate Its candidate and the
people will vote thereon. The candi
date receiving the highest vote wilt
then be elected by the Legislature. The
act will operate to bring every candi
date into the field early so that the
people may look him over and deter
mine his fitness. The day of the dark
.horse will have passed when this bill
I becomes operative and the scandals
that have blackened the record of
manfr California Legislatures will be
at an end."
It is anticipated that the bill will
develop a warm debate, but a majority
â of those that have heard of It express
themselves as favoring Its adoption.
*
There is much blacklisting done by the
railroad, express, water and lighting
companies and this provision will reach
them. On the other side it will prevent
a renewal of the scenes we have long
witnessed in this State, particularly in
San Francisco, where aggrieved em
ployes parade the streets, injuring the
business of former employers and the
State's good name."
MORE PAY FOR JUDGES.
Senator Welch of San Francisco in
tqpduced to-day the bill providing for
the increase of the salaries of the
Judges of the Superior Court of the
city and county of San Francisco to
$6000 per annum.
That the new appellate courts are
about ready for organization was made
evident to-day when Senator Hahn,
who held a long consultation with Gov
ernor Pardee last Saturday, introduced
a bill providing for the attaches of the
courts. The bill provides for the ap
pointment by the appellate judges of
a clerk, deputy clerk, stenographer and
bailiff for each of the three courts, the
clerk to receive a salary of $2400 a year,
the deputy $1200, stenographer $2400
and bailiff $1200. A second bill pro
vides for the appointment of three
deputy reporters of decision* for the
Supreme Court at salaries of $100 a
month each. Another bill provides for
the appropriation of $25,000 for the rent
ing and furnishing of quarters for the
three appellate courts.
WOODWARD'S GAME LAW.
The question of when and how and
where the game and other birds of the
State shall be killed by sportsmen and
others again came before the Senate
to-day. The most interesting of the
many bills was one presented by Wood
ward of Santa Rosa, who, as the rep
resentative of several thousand agri
culturists, presented the following:
An act to repeal all acts or parts of acts
prohibiting or imposing penalties for the kill
ing of wild game upon inclosed land by the
owner or lawful occupant thereof.
The people of the State of California, repre
sented in Senate and Assembly, do enact as
follows:
Section IâAll laws or parts of law* for
bidding or authorising local authorities to
forbid the killing of wild game upon inclosed
land by the owner or occupant thereof, or by
bis direction or consent, or providing penalties
therefor, are hereby repealed; provided, that
this act snail not be construed to repeal or
modify any law restricting or prohibiting the
catching of flsh.
â¢ Section 2âThis act shall be In effect from
and after its passage.
PROTECTIVE MEASURES.
Shortridge offered a bill to prevent
the sale of game birds to any ope at
any time of the year, and Selvage went
to his assistance with another to ex
tend the season wherein it shall be un
lawful to kill quail or any mountain
game birds from February 15 to Octo
ber L Leavitt put in another protective
measure, making It unlawful to kill
game birds after 6:30 p. m. and before
6 a, m.
Two bills of interest to the building
and loan associations of the State were
introduced to-day. One, by Hahn, pro
vides that building and loan associa
tions after they have accumulated
a capital of $200,000 or more may issue
non-withdrawable stock. As the law
now exists, Senator Hahn explained,
owners may withdraw their stock ana,

FRIENDS RALLY TO DEFENSE
OF ACCUSED SUPERIOR JUDGE
Torrance Case Before House
THREE LEGISLATORS WHO HAVE INTRODUCED SEVERAL BILLS OF IM
PORTANCE AND WHO ARE TAKING A PROMINENT PART IN THE DELIB
ERATIONS OF THE LOWER HOUSE AND THE SENATE.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 16.âThe im
peachment proceedings against Supe
rior "fludge El is ha S. Torrance of San
Diego County, which it was announced
in The Call at the opening of the ses
sl6n would be begun before the pres
ent Legislature, materialized in the As
sembly this morning. The Los Ange
les Bar Association presented the
charges through W. H. Anderson,
chairman of its grievance committee.
They were accompanied by a petition
that they be investigated and If found
true impeachment follow, or if found
false that Judge Torrance have his
judicial name cleared of all taint. The
charges, which embrace intoxication,
immoral behavior and improper con
duct in office, were prepared by the
trustees of the association, among
I whom is Superior Judge Curtis D. Wil
bur. The others whose names are at
tached are: J. Wiserman Macdonald,
Oscar Q. Mueller, J. H. Shankland and
Russ Avon.
The document is prefaced with a
statement that though the Los An
geles Bar Association Is a local body,
it feels it to be its duty to aid in the
maintenance of the dignity and honor
of the legal profession, without local
restriction,and to right existing wrongs
without regard to boundaries, and that
It has received evidence to Justify a
belief that Judge Torrance has been
guilty of misdemeanor In office, willful
misconduct and willful neglect of duty.
It was ordered that the charges be
not read and that they be placed on a
secret file. The Speaker appointed As
semblymen Weyand, Devlin, Barnes,
McGowan and O'Brien a special com
mittee to look into the charges.
TORRANCE HAS FRIENDS.
From the bluntness of the charges
made it might seem that Torrance's
(ate was already sealed, but he has
many friends in San Diego County and
a different tale comes from there. The
Impeachment document was not pre-,
sented by a San Diego Assemblyman,
but by McCartney of Los Angeles. The
two Assemblymen from San Diego
support Judge Torrance and intimate
that Los Angeles is merely "butting
in" where it has no business. It is
certain that Torrance will put up a
strong fight and the case will become
a celebrated one in the State.
Assemblyman Barnes, the senior
member of the lower house from San
Diego County, said something about
"disgruntled attorneys" of Los Ange
les when asked about his stand in the
Torrance case.
"As matters stand now, I am in
favor of Judge Torrance," he said. "If
evidence is introduced showing him
to be unfit to sit on the judicial bench
corporations, cause a run on the same
that always, results In financial injury
to the innocent stockholders that
choose to hold in good faith.
The other bill, by Shortridge, seeks to
create a bureau of building and loan
supervision, the bureau to consist of
two members to be appointed by the
Governor at salaries of $2400 per annum
and a secretary at $1800 per annum.
The act presented by Pendleton pro
v i â g tOT tne Increase of the number
of Superior Judges of Los Angeles from
six to nine was finally passed and sent
to the Assembly for its action.
j I will be against him. The peculiar
I phase of the case is that this com
f plaint does not come from Â£an Diego,
that from the Los Angeles bar. The
bar of San Diego is satisfied with him
and I believe the people in general
i are."
So far the threatened impeachment
proceedings against Judge Smith of
; Santa Cruz have not been presented
fo: the consideration of the Legisla
ture. Last week many of Judge Smith's
friends were in the city, among them
prominent Republicans, who said that
I though they did not agree with Judge
I Smith politically- they vouch for his
I integrity and would stand by him in
I event his accusers Insisted in taking
him before the bar of the Senate.
These friends say Judge Smith is the
victim of spite work.
BILL EXCITES WONDER,
The special committee appointed by
the last Assembly to investigate the
affairs of the various State prisons and
make a report presented a bill of but
$722 80, this being the total asked for
by it for expenses, including clerk hire.
The committee on contingent expenses
and accounts reported the bill favor
ably to-day, allowing $720 80.
"I wonder what any Assembly com
mittee having the liberty that this one
had did. not take a trip to St. Louis and
Paris and charge the cost up to the
State," said Assemblyman Rolley. "I
am astounded at the bill. I have a
notion to vote against allowing the
claim because the members did not
take in the World's Fair during their
investigation."
The claim was allowed.
The first bill to be reported on
favorably by a committee was that fix
ing the boundary between Sacramento
and San Joaquin counties. Chairman
Pyle of the Committee on Counties and
County Boundaries reported recom
mending its passage.
Goodrich of Pasadena introduced a
joint resolution that will put the Leg
islature on record In regard to the

DRAINAGE QUESTION IS DISCUSSED
AT A COMMITTEE MEETING.
GOVERNOR'S PLANS CONCERNING
IMPORTANT WORK ARE ADOPTED
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 16.âThe Sen
ate and Assembly Committees on
Drainage, Swamp and Overflowed
Lands and the Assembly Committee
on Levees and River Improvements
met in joint session this afternoon to
consider the resolution presented by
the executive committee of the River
Improvement and Drainage Associa
tion of California memoralizing Con
gress to appoint a board of tnrce * r . my
engineers to investigate the feasibility
of cleaning the channels of naylgapie
rivers of the State and reclaiming in
undated land as provided In the re
port of the Board of Engineers recent
ly employed by the association, also
the proposed bill empowering the Got -
ernor to appoint a commission of three
to act In co-operation with the Federal
board.
The committee was informed that
the Governor was opposed to any paid
State commfssion in this convention
on the ground of economy, the chief
executive holding that a commission
consisting of three State [officers who
would receive no extra compensation
would do just as well. His desire, it
was stated, was that Frank D. Ryan,
Commissioner of Public "Works, State
Engineer Nourse and Lieutenant Gov
ernor Anderson should be named as
the commission. There was a
protest at first from several members
of the committees against this, but
the objectors subsided when told that
it would be better to follow the wishes
of the Governor in the matter than to
have a bill carrying a paid commission
passed and vetoed.

Measure Appropriating $70,000 for
Portland Exposition Introduced.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 16. âAction
toward providing an appropriation to
insure the creditable representation
of-California at the Lewis and Clark
International Exposition at Portland.
Or., this year was taken*this morning
when Assemblyman Bliss of Alameda
introduced in the lower house a bill
appropriating $70,000, in addition to
the sum of $20,000 set aside by the
last Legislature, for this purpose.
This makes a total of $90,000 and .is
deemed sufficient by proper handling
to make a first class display, with
what aid the various counties will give
by supplying material.
The bill passed by the last Legisla
ture names Governor Pardee as com
missioner to this exposition and gives
him direction of the expenditure of
the $20,000. The one presented by
Assemblyman Bliss to-day makes no
provision for commissioners.. There
is a plan to amend the bill in commit
tee so that it will provide for two
honorary commissioners. It Is not
thought the chief executive will have
any trouble in securing non-salaried
commissioners to serve the State. At
any rate it is pretty certain none of
the money will be spent on a salaried
commission.
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 16.âThe Judi
ciary Committee of the Senate held a
brief meeting this afternoon. The
greater part oj the discussion related
to Hahn's bill that purposes correcting
the law as it stands in relation to jury
trials, wherein special questions of
fact prevail If In conflict with the gen
eral verdict In the case. The commit
tee expects that it will soon have the
question of a constitutional amend
ment to deal with in relation to crim
inal trials by Jury, it being the inten
tion, it is said, of a Senator yet un
earned to Introduce a bill making the
verdict of nine of a jury of twelve suf
ficient for conviction or acquittal.
It is said that this bill will be bit
terly opposed on the ground that it is
aimed at the very foundation of the
people's liberty.

Dr. Maguire Scores British Ways
LONDON. Jan. IÂ«.â"At West Point
the United States has the best training
school for army officers in the world.
â¢It is incomparably superior to our mili
tary school at Sandhurst."
This statement was made by Dr. T.
Miller Maguire. Here Dr. Maguire is
accounted as much an authority on all
that pertains to military education as
Edison is with respect to electricity.
He has made it a life study. At his
famous private academy in Earl's
Court square has trained more pu
pils for army staff examinations than
any military coach in the United King
dom. Lord Woiseley has spoken of him
as "one of, the ablest lecturers on mili
tary history and the art of war we
have In England." Lord Roberts has
extolled his military knowledge in
equally Mattering terms.
In what respect is West Point so
far ahead of the great English military
.school." was asked. He replied:
in c erytlilng that counts for efficiency, and
thi not a general in the British army.

ACADEMY'S BROAD TRAINING.

wise, though history and geography are ob
ligatory, but it is absolutely Impossible that
a duffe: can come out Of it as an officer In the
tjnitrd States army Not only Is the training
â adapted to gi\" him the knowledge necessary
for the profession of arms, but. what is equally
important, to develop the necessary character.
It is because thesÂ« two thing* are so happily
combined at West Point that I rank it even
â¢higher than Germany's military training
achools for officers, which, as regards efft-
Viency. approach nearest to it. though Baron
Fumeyaisa has given me a full statement of
Japanese education that Is startling in its
'spirit and excellence.
Very different, unfortunately, is the state
of affairs at Sandhurst, which is practically 1
a preserve for rich men's sons. Its condition j
was revealed In the report of the Akers
'l>ouÃlas Commission, appointed te, consider
the education and training of officers of the
army. -Their report showed that cadets had
"little inducement to work at Sandhurst and
instrue tors little inducement to teach." Most
of the military textbooks in use were found
to be antiquated and obsolete. There was no
.insistence on a high standard of proficiency.
To get through with as little trouble as pos
sibln was the dominating idea. Neither as re
.ga,.-ds knowledge nor character was the train
ing of the kind necessary to produce compe
tent officers.
I have had officers come to me for instruc
tionârich men's sons and former pupils of our
much vaunted public schoolsâwho told me
they wÂ«>re ashamed of l>Â«lng dependent on oth
ers to write their reports for them and show
them how to perform their duties.
Although the Akers-Dcuglas report was
made over two years ago, things have not
improved a bit. In some respects they are
even worse than they were then. If anything

I fashionable school boys. If the latter schools

classes of England will soon be decadent.
We hays profited nothing by the numerous
"regrettable incidents" of the Boer war that
were so largely duo to the Incapacity of com
manding officers. Only a few days ago Gen
eral Hutchinson Issued a report on the exam
inations for promotion of officers in the regu
lar army which reveals a state of ignorance
among many of the candidates that can only
be characterteed as disgraceful. General Hutch
inson states that bad spelling and Inability to
express themselves clearly were the failings
of a large number of them. Many of thÂ«m
showed that they were unfit for the duty of
instructing non-commissioned officers and men.
owing to being themselves insufficiently in
structed.
CAUSE OF DISASTERS.
The genera! deplores the fact that officers
neglect to keep their military knowledge up
to date by reading and study, as men in other
professions have to do. He describes the re
sults of the examinations In milita-y engineer
ing, tactics and topography as "indifferent."
the candidates generally failing to appreciate
the situations in the problems given them to
solve, the "majority ot them ignoring the en
emy or giving him credit for little intel
ligence."
It is appalling to reflect what disasters such
Incompetency as lls here shown woutd lead us
Into it we were engaged in a war with a first
class power -with Russia, for instance, for the
possession of India\
It should te borne in mind that the short
comings to which General Hutchinson calls at
tention Indicate not merely defective military
training, but. imperfect elementary education.
The report, therefore, constitutes quite as much
an Indictment of our swell public schoolsâ
Eton. Harrow, Rugby and such places where
the classes from whom our officers are drawn
are chiefly educatedâas of the instructions
where they receive their professional training.
Owing to the shortage of officers caused by
the casualties of the Boer war, many young
gertlentenâgraduates, most of them, of these
public schoolsâreceived commissions without
parsing the usual examinations. In India large
numbers of them, according to an official re
port, were found to lie so wanting In element
ary education as to be incapable of receiving
the ordinary garrison instruction. Many of
them, therefore, had to have recourse to the
regimental schoolmasters to remedy the defects
of expensive educations, which had left them
Ignorant of the simple branches of learning
that are obligatory In the higher grade classes
of the board schools, as wa term our free
schools. Surely no more humiliating report
was ever issued about the officers of an army.
AMERICA'S SUPERIOR MEN.
Napoleon appraised the relative value of
brain power and physical power In warfare at
three to one. Taking into account the enor
mous strides that have since been made in the
application of science to war, Lord Roberts now
estimates it as ten to one. And yet we con
tinue to bestow commissions in the army on
Â»men who are not only ignorant of all scientific
knowledge, but like-vise of tne very rudiments
of an oidinary education. The officer class is
not to blame. It has clamored for general and
technical education for the last fifteen years,
but social influences and false economy are
against any reform.
The fact Is our ruling classesâproducts of
the same system cf defective education and
men for the m ist part quite incapable of earn
ing their own livings in any industrial or com
mercial pursuitsâare hopelessly Incompetent
for thÂ° government uf the empire. Man for
man. the members of the American Cabinet
are greatly superior to ours. They are practi
cal men, who have demonstrated their ability
by achieving success in business or professions,
life before they received their high appoint
ments. Xou pay them on>y a year each.
We pay ours over three times as much. Yet
when Elihu Rjot comes over here to settle the
Alaska boundary question he easily scores over
our high salaried law officials.
If. after America has brought her navy up
to the high standard which she aims at, we
should ever have the misfortune to go to war
with herâwhich God forbid.âshe would flatten
us out like a pancake!

enacted at the request of Jerome when
he was trying to induce Jesse Lew-
Isohn to testify against Richard Can
field. That law automatically releases
from punishment any gambler who
gives evidence himself to the District
Attorney, at the same time compelling
him" to give such evidence. Lawyer
O'Relly said:
There will be no rambling houses in this
city. The Dowling- act has given the District
Attorney a weapon which he has used to close
effectually every place in the city. That
they will not reopen is shown by the surrender
of ail gambling paraphernalia. They cannot
afford to buy every time the District Attor
ney takes a notion to make a raid.

DARING COSSACK RAIDERS INFLICT HEAVY DAMAGE
UPON GENERAL OYAMA'S LINE OF COMMUNICATION
Kuropatkin Reports the Capture of
Japanese Stores.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 16.âGen
eral Kuropatkin, in a dispatch to Em
peror Nicholas, reporting the Russian
cavalry raids on January 10 and Janu
ary 11, says:
"The Japanese suffered heavily. The
Russian losses during those two days
were three officers killed and ten
wounded, and fifteen soldiers killed and
forty-nine wounded."
The general adds that the cavalry
captured a quantity of stores and pris
oners, and says that the Japanese
stores at Yinkow were ablaze for near
ly the whole night of January 12.
The text of General Kuropatkln's re
port is as follows:
â 'During the evening of January 10
one and a half companies of Japanese
infantry and half a squadron of Jap
anese dragoons were defeated with
great losses.
"On January II a Japanese company
and two squadrons of cavalry, which
were occupying Newchwang, were
driven out by the Cossacks, who occu
pied the place and afterward pursued
the company, defeating it and inflict
ing heavy loss. The same night our
patrols damaged the railway line, tele
graph line, a train and two locomo
tives. During these two days our cav
alry defeated several small detach
ments and captured one officer, four
teen soldiers and 500 carts with stores.
Our casualties were three officers killed
and ten wounded, and fifteen soldiers
killed and forty-nine wounded.
"On January 12 our patrols damaged
the railway six miles from Tlnkow. At
4 p. m. on January 12 a Russian de
tachment reached Yinkow. Our artil
lery cannonaded the station, set lire to
the stores and later stormed the sta
tion. The Japanese opened with rifles
and machine guns and our men sought
shelter in ditches and again attacked,
until they reached the railroad line,
when a strong column of Japanese In
fantry appeared, advancing from Tal

Japanese Say Port Arthur Could
Have Held Out Much Longer.
PORT ARTHUR. Saturday, Jan. 14.â
On Friday, January 13, the victorious
Japanese army formally entered Port
Arthur. General Nogi, accompanied
by his staff, entered first through the
old town and took his stand In the
public square of the new town. The
army, which was represented by one
regiment from each brigade, then
formed in procession and passed the
saluting base. This procession was five
miles long. Then the army passed out
of the city through the new town.
It is evident, many of the Japanese
say, that the surrender of the fortress
was not necessary, as there were 31,000
effective fighting men in the fortress.
The ammunition was short, but it had
not been exhausted. Food was scarce,
but private stores had not been re
quisitioned by the military, and there
is no difficulty in getting good meals In
the city even now from stores in the
possession of private persons.
The position, it is said, was capable
of being defended for months longer.
It is the opinion of non-combatants at.
Port Arthur that surrender was not
necessary, as the troops were willing
and able to fight to the bitter end.
General Stoessel Is much blamed by
these non-combatants for what they
characterize as the disgraceful con
clusion of a splendid defense, which
ended with the death of General Kon
dratenko, who was much loved by the
soldiers and who, they point out, was
the life of the defense.
LONDON, Jan. 17.âThe latest news
as to the condition of Port Arthur when
it was surrendered to the Japanese oc
casions much discussion as to General
Stoessel's reason for capitulating. Crit
icism, however, is generally lenient,
there being a tendency to regard Gen
eral Nogi's tributes to General Stoes
sel's courageous defense as much in his
favor, and the Inclination is to credit
General Stoessel with the knowledge
that the morale of his garrison was
shattered. â¢
The Dally Telegraph's Kobe corre
spondent gives a somewhat theatrical
account of the final meeting of the gen
erals at Port Arthur prior to the sur
render, which account was obtained
from Russian generals at Nagasaki.
According to this story, twelve generals
assembled at General Stoessel's house.
Asked the reason for two additional
vacant chairs, General Stoessel, burst
ing into tears, explained that they for
merly belonged to beloved departed,
and, having paid a tribute to the gal
lant dead. General Stoessel abruptly
exclaimed:
"Well, gentlemen, I presume we will
fight till the end."
The disci 3lon which ensued showed
that the only alternatives were prompt
surrender or speedy annihilation. Then
champagne glasses were filled and the
Emperor's health was solemnly hon
ored.
Meanwhile the artillery thundered
outside, and as several shells burst in
the vicinity General Stoessel ordered
the removal of the Emperor's photo
graph, the sole adornment of the bare
walls, remarking:
"It is not right that his Majesty
should witness such proceedings."
The decision to capitulate being
unanimously reached each general
signed the record, many sobbing aloud.
Finally, General Stoessel stood at at
tention, silently offering a prayer,
brought his sword to salute and shout
ed "Long live the Csar!" which the
others repeated in chorus and the coun
cil ended.
It is said that Madame Stoessel
seemed stunned and cried aloud when
she heard the decision. It is added
that acute estrangement exists between
General Stoessel and his men, owing to
the arrangement of favorable terms for
the officers, but not for the men.
The correspondent at Port Arthur of
the Daily Mail describes an incident of
the siege of the fortress, when, after a
disastrous attempt to capture a Rus
sian position, a Japanese reserve regi
ment was ordered to renew the at
tempt. Not a man stirred. The major
in command advanced alone, vainly
calling to his men to follow. He was
soon kllied. and after a time the regi
ment, apparently struck by remorse,
advanced to the assault, which com
pletely failed. The regiment was sent
back to the rear, punished with forced
drills and compelled to listen to ser
vices in memory of the dead major be
fore It was allowed to go to the front
again.

Iron poles and lay new and Improved I
rails along the route of the line in com- j
pliance with the the demand ma'> by <
property owners.
Supervisor Lunstedt s;>*d he had as-!
certained that the <â¢ jfnpany had al- J
ready begun t.. unsightly poles j
on California street for a distance of
four blocks before it had obtained a j
permit. He submitted two protests
signed by fifteen California-street
property tvwners against granting the
corporation a permit unless it is com
pelled, to erect ornamental iron poles
and. lay grooved rails on the route. The
Protestants say they propose to lay a |
>itumen roadway and cement walks
to the boulevard connecting Golden'
â¢ late Park and the Presidio, for which
l>onds have been issued, and that
wooden poles and dangerous rails
would prevent the improvement of the
â¢treet.
The attorney for the I'nited Rail-!
priads said that it was proposed to con- j
Mruct an up-to-date electric system. |
Mnd that permission was wanted to use,
electricity on three blocks only, the j
company already having the privilege!
on the rest of the route.
O. L. Scott, a property owner, said
the poles on the ground are not even'
sawed or planed, and the company
should be compelled to put up decent j
poles and lay Hat rails in return for'
the privilege which, he said, was worth
51.000.000, as the road had been bonded j
fi>v that amount.
"So far as I am concerned," said
Supervisor Comte. "I will not vote to
give this company or any other com
pany any privilege, unless it means to
keep in pace with the disposition of the
citizens to beautify this city and not)
retard the progressive spirit of the
times. They can cut down their divi- !
dends a little and construct a modern j
rlectric road with ornamental poles and
flat rails."
The board gave notice to the United
Railroads that operations along the
line must be discontinued pending the
settlement of the matter. Abbott
agreed to report the action of the board
to the managers of the corporation.
The resolution granting the United
Railroads permission to blast along its
right of way on Thirty-third avenue, j
through the Sutro estate property, for j
its proposed California street and Cliff I
House electric line was finally passed.
The protest against the acceptance
of Florida street, between Twenty-'
fourth and Twenty-fifth, was referred j
to the Street Committee.
The board passed to print an ordi
nance ordering the construction of an !
engine-house on Twenty-sixth avenue,
near Point Lobos avenue, at a cost of
$10,000.
That portion of Shipley street, from
Elizabeth to Ritch, was expunged from
the official map, as it is private prop

PROVES A BOON
Under Heavier Tax the Dives
That Disgraced Town of
Bremerton All Disappear
i The town of Bremerton, on Puget
Sound, has furnished advocates of a
high license lor saloons with a power
ful arguments. When the I'nited States
nary yard was established there the
main street of that hitherto unknown
hamlet assumed a business importance
in keeping with the sudden addition
lo the population of an army of me
( bi nics and several hundred free hand
ed bluejackets. Saloon-keepers were
among the first to realize the money
makiqg possibilities involved in -on
tiguity to a large and regular payroll,
v. ithin a tew months sixteen gin mills
Â«'< re in full blast along Bremerton's
principal thoroughfare. On paydays
the coin distributed by Cnele Sam soon
found its way into their tills. Jack
left his money in Bremerton but took
his jag back to the navy yard, where
the question of ni tint lining discipline
SOOfl '>Â« i arric a serious problem.
The matter Was reported lo the Navy
Department. Prompt action was
ti;ken. All liberty was denied the
si.ilormen and all work, on which an
army of mechanics had been employed,
was stopped. The people of Bremer
t( :i were warned that unless the sa
loons were removed from the neigh
borhood of the navy yard no more
ships would be sent to Bremerton for
repairs and that no sailor would be al
lowed outside the yard.
The saloon license at Bremerton at
this time was $300 a year. There were
sixteen saloons, all of a low type and
most of them deadfalls w here Jack was
relieved by trick and fraud of the
money he had been unable to spend
Ik fore succumbing to the paralysis
caused by the liquid refreshment
served. The people of Bremerton were
not quite so prompt to act as the Navy
Department had been, but when Uncle
Snm showed that his threat was not a
bluff the local authorities took decisive
steps to meet the Navy Department's
demands.
According to a navy officer who ar
rived here yesterday on the Queen,
Bremerton Is now a model town. The
I,tst thing the local authorities did
was to raise the saloon license to $1000
a year and to refuse to Issue any li
cense at all for business on the main
street. As a result, Bremerton's main
street Is clear of saloons, Bremerton
is free of dives, and In all the town
there are only six saloons and these
are well conducted. Discipline at the
Bremerton navy yard Is up to the serv
ice standard and the merchants of the
t< wn are enjoying a steady prosperity.

THE BOOK LAW
Hearing in Cheung Case Cut
Snort That Lawyers May
Look Up the Authorities
0
A one-hour round was fought in the
case of chan Cheung yesterday morn
ing before Judge Law lor. Robert Fer
ial of the District Attorney's office and
ex-Governor Budd were in frequent
conflict of vociferation over the light
of the defendant to inquire into the
proceedings of the Grand Jury that led
to the indictment for murder. The law
bi.oks were totally ignored and each
n.ntented himself with fiery declama
tion of how he thought the statutes
read.
Judge Lawlor's dinipiing smiles be
came wrinkles of impatience and be
fore abruptly adjourning he pointedly
directed counsel to look up some legal
authorities on their respective conten
ts DS and have them in court next Sat
urday morning, to which time he post
poned the hearing of the motion to
quash the indictment.
Andrew M. Davis, member of the
police committee of the cirand Jury,
was again called to the stand yester
oay. He admitted that he had dis
cussed with Andrews and Bowes, his
colleagues, before the indictment was
returned, their efforts to make Chan
Cheung tell of his connection with po
lice corruption in Chinatown. But his
recollection was hazy as to what was
said. He explained that he did not
pay much attention to the matter at
the time because he was Interested in
s< me other investigation.
According to the witness he was
neither biased nor prejudiced against
the prisoner when voting to charge him
with complicity in the murder of Tom
Yick. The defense is seeking to show
that the indictment war inspired by
the police committee hernnHi of Chan
Cheung's refusal to tell what It be
lieved he knew of the corruption fund
that was collected from the gambling
g;. mts for protection from interference
by the police.
Foreman Andrews was the next wit - j
r.tss. He again told the court he did
not vote on the Indictment. His reason
for so refraining was the fear that ]
the defendant might gain some tech- j
nical advantage, inasmuch as the wit
ness., had been one or those who
"sweated" him in trying to force him
to divulge the great Chinatown secrets, j
Then Budd produced a subpena call- i
ing on Chan Cheung to appear before ]
the police committee on Christmas day. |
The attorney said it was served the I
day after and he wanted to ask An- I
drews about It. The witness said the j
first time he saw It was 3 o'clock a. m., '
the morning after Christmas, when the
defendant showed it to him. This was
the night the foreman and Bowes
maintained vigil over their prisoner In I
seeking to force a confession from him.
Budd was going to make much of
this point. Ferral tried to address the
court, then exclaimed that the ex-Gov
ernor would not give him a chance to
talk. Budd was by this time quiescent
and declared that he had nothing to j
say. "I know you really have nothing
to say," was one of the Assistant Dis-!
trict Attorney's retorts courteous. The
tie of friendship between Budd and!
Ferral Is strong, but their love of
wrangling Is stronger.
Counsel for the defendant asked the
District Attorney to agree to ball "In
any amount," but he flatly refused.
He thinks Chan Cheung belongs behind
the bars.
ELECTRIC ROAD ANSWERS
RIVAL'S INJUNCTION SUIT
Santa Rosa Line Contends That Cali
fornia Northwestern Has No Title
to Spur That Was Crossed.
An answer was filed yesterday by
the Petaluma and Santa Rosa Railway
Company to the suit for injunction
filed by the California Northwestern
to prevent the former company from
building its line across the plaintiff's
tracks in Santa Rosa. The defendant
denies that it has threatened or used
force in attempting to build the
crossing. It answers in defense that
it was granted a franchise by the
Santa Rosa Council to build its elec
tric line along Railroad street In that
city and has expended $20,000 in the
purchase of realty for terminal facil
ities.
This franchise was granted in May
last, and in October permission was
given to Grace Bros, to build a spur
from their brewery to connect with
the Northwestern. The Mayor did not
approve this permission, but the spur*
was built and crossed Railroad street
100 feet from the electric road's ter
minal. The latter proceeded to build
across the sour and was driven out
by the opposition. It Is contended that
the Northwestern has no title to the
spur and that the Petaluma and -Santa
Rosa company had Grace Bros.' per
mission to cross the track.

as Miss Violetta Montrevor, balladist,
but the very first evening of her engage
ment there one of the low comedians
irreverently addressed her as "Dim
ples," and so apt was the sobriquet
that It received unanimous adoption.
Only as "Dimples" is she now ever al
luded to by the folk in front. At the
conclusion of her opening song, entitled
"She Should Be Scolded, but Not
Turned Adrift," the house rises as one
man and shouts, "Good girlf Dimples."

spiritâthe dimples are so numerous as
to be suggestive of a thickly quilted
cushion âor two of them.
Among the masculinity that surren
dered to the physical and vocal charms
of "Dimples" was ori" Joseph Burton,
a small young man with a large and
nasty temper and no fixed vocation.
He ardently pressed his suit, but the
lady told him she was wedded to her

tention of applying for divorce, so he
suffered in silence arid worshiped from

when he was driven to jealous frenzy

A REPUTATION
How II Was Made and Retained
in San Francisco.
A good reputation is not easily
earned, and it was only by hard, con
sistent work among our citizens that
Doan's Kidney Pills won their way
to the proud distinction attained in
this locality. The public indorsement
of scores of San Francisco residents
has rendered invaluable service to
the community. Fead what this citi
zen says:
F. T. Collins, silk hatter, of 10101,4
Hyde street says: "It is a difficult
matter to give greater praise to
Doan's Kidney Pills than their re
markable properties deserve. For
several years I was bothered more or
less with kidney complaint, particu
larly if I contracted a cold, which
was sure to seat itself in the region
of my back just over the kidneys. I
fooled around for a long time trying
medicine of various kinds, none of
which even helped, and finally Mrs.
Collins, who had been reading con
siderable about Doan's Kidney Pills,
advised me to take a course of the
treatment. If the first box had not
brought results I can positively guar
antee this, I never would have bought
a second, and if the second had not
stopped the last attack, and, what is
better, there has not been a symptom
of a recurrence for six months, I
could not be induced under any cir
cumstances to publicly recommend
the preparation."

Judge Conlan is weighing the com
plaint of Deon D. Bernardi, "King of
the Newsboys," against the defense
submitted by Charles McNulty, a sub
ject of the complainant. On the last
cay of last year Mr. Bernard! provided
Mr. McNulty with thirteen dozen of
fish horns to sell to celebrants lhat
same evening on Market street, and Mr.
McNulty failed to return either the in
struments of torture or the cash which
he presumably received for them. Mr.
McNulty pleaded that after disposing
of the horns he commenced to greet
the new year in a bibulous way and
v. as arrested for drunkenness and im
prisoned ten days, thus being deprived
of opportunity to pay his indebtedness
to Mr. Bernardi. When the truth or

monopolize her attention. Prior to his

after Mi. Jackson and rhe exchanged

other for the remainder of the festival.
The belle erased every name on her
list and reolaced it with his, and he
ignored the allurements of various
maidens who sought to be swung by
his encircling arm. As one gentleman,
whose signature had been wiped out,
remarked to a group of his fellows:
"It's all off wid us. Since she trew
'er lamps on dat guy it's curtains fer
us mugs."
It was not to be expected, of course,
that the repudiated ones would tame
ly submit to their cutting out. They
tried, individually and collectively to
persuade the belle into belief that her
behavior was a direct violation of
ballroom etiquette, to say nothing of
the fact that it might reflect unfavor
ably upon her discriminative ability.
"W'y, kid, youse must be crohey,"
one impassioned pleader urged. "Wot-

When suasion failed violence was
resorted to, and that's how Arthur
Carroll, Joseph Devlin, John Calla
han and William Callahan, all in their
late teens, came to be arrested on the
street arid charged with battery. They
had followed Mr. Jackson and the

Ytsterday we were plain San Fran

volatile throng, drinking beer at cafe
tables like seasoned boulevardiers.
Hinging cascarone, and sinsrina: the
songs of the street with fine noncha

The ballroom at the Palace has
never held quite so swagger a crowd In

The programme opened with some
capital music by "'an amateur orches

the backbone of the show, rendering
brave service to the vocal stunts that

George C. Walker, ably abetted by

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 17, 1905.
MISS HOPPER
COMES AS STAR
Law's "A Country Mouse"
Depicts an Elaborately
Sophisticated Damsel
LONDON GAY SET SEEN
riay Is Full of Wit, but Ex
hibits Society of the Great
Capital at Its Worst
With "A Country Mouse." by Arthur
Law, given at the Columbia Theater
last night, one can survive for a while
at least without Pinero s "Wife With
out a Smile." The London of Mr. Law
is the London of Pinero in ' The Gay
Lord Quex," of Henry Arthur Jones in,
say, "Joseph Entangled"; of R. C. Car
ton in "Wheels Within Wheels." It is
only less niceâas Oscar Wiide would
ha\e delighted in not saying. The Fau
bourg Germain has nothing to learn
from Mr. Law's Park Lane. His peo
ple throughout the cast, with the ex
ception of the Galllcally ridiculous de
ceived husband, a charwoman and a
butler who desires to die respectable
and therefore gives notice because
ping-pong and the "Prince of Pilsen"
are played on Sundays, are as frankly
unmoral as the best Parisian society of
the stage.
Lady Sylvia Bowlby and Violet Ayns
ley are discovered. They are smoking,
skillfully, and discussing Lady Bowl
by's lover. Lady Bowlby has decided
to "fly." Bowlby is a member of the
House of Commons, never asks what
his wife spends and dines at home only
when he is invited. His wife's lover Is
poor, but, as Lady Bowlby tells Miss
Aynsley, her husband has settled
Â£2u0.000 upon her, which "in these
cases is not interfered with." "Take
my tip." Miss Aynsley advises, "it's
not worth it." "But you don't'know,
you have never been in love." Lady
Bowlby sighs.
It is then Miss Aynsley's turn. "Oh.
haven't I?" she asks. "Why do you
think 1 am here to-night?" Altes Ayns
ley is there to meet Lord Bob Wyck
ham. She has met him before. She Is
known to him as "Mrs." Aynsley be
cause Lord Bob's "love" begins only
with the wedding-ring.
"Does he love you?" Lady Sylvia
asks. This and that proof Miss Ayns
ley then adduces, ending with "He
writes me the most beautiful letters."
"Ah," says Lady Sylvia, "he has given
you a hold over him." "But he doesn't
sign them," says Miss Violet, "and
they're typewritten. I wonder if
I'm the only recipient " Of this sit
uation the dramatist makes eood
enough fun himself, when he later
makes Lord Bob> play the injured
swain who has been deceived into lov
ing an unmarried woman.
Well, that's the tone of the whole
thing. . The "gentlemen" later join the
ladies, to discover Miss Aynsley with
carefully disarranged lingerie about
her ankles, and the "country mouse"
enters. The country mouse is an in
genu of the Nancy Brown type, "from
the country." but can give points in
Intrigue to the whole unpleasant gang.
Humorously, and with almost poetic
Justice, she lands the senile Duke of
St. Kitts in the last act.
Clever the play undoubtedly is.
its situations highly ingenious, its
dialogue bright; but in the heavier
English handling of the theme it lacks
what makes a "Divorcons," for ex
ample, possible and delightful. There
isn't an ideal in the crowd, not the
poorest little rag of one. There is not
one sweet or fine thing done during
the whole play, not one fine thing said.
One laughs with shame, and comes
away with a bad taste in one's teeth.
Perdie. when its dramatists get
through with it, there will be almost
aÂ«= little left of London as the Central
has left us of New York.
Little Edna Wallace Hopper, once
happily of "Wang" and "El Capltan,"
returns to us as the star of the piece.
She has not grown any, being still
about as tall as a minute and slim as
a match. But Miss Hopper made a
distinctly pleasing impression, particu
larly in the curtain-raiser, "Captain
January," of which more later. It is
possible that Miss Hopper, as "the
breezy, grassy, buttercuppy" Angela
Muir, suggested overmuch the sou
brette. She lacked also the ability to
suggest fully the simulated unsophlsti
cation, and at the same time to take
the audience into her confidence as to
th*Â» simulation. But the catty, mlnxy
quality of Miss Muir Miss Hopper was
very happy In suggesting and the
whole performance was largely in ad
vance of anything the actress has be
fore attempted. Her English accent is
dutiable.
The support is competent though
not brilliant. Miss Emma Janvier I
leads with a capital Violet Aynsley; I
Miss Kathryne Browne does Lady Syl
via with picturesque and dramatic 11- I
lusion, and Mabel Norton Is a truly :
comical charwoman. Edgar Norton.
Geoffrey C. Stein. Paul McAllister and
Paul Everton are all acceptable in the j
various male roles.
Those going to the Columbia this j
week are advised not to miss the )
"Captain January." as fragrantly
charming as "A Country Mouse" is
not. Here Miss Hopper appears as a
child of ten with striking illusion. And
here Mr. Everton shows a portrait of
an old sailor, powerful, touching, con- l
vincing. that is one of the best things
of its kind seen here. The play is all |
about a child rescued by an old sailor,
the two living together in a faraway !
lighthouse, and la a little Idyll.

Alcazar.
I A sigh arose from the audience last
i night at the Alcazar when the lead
! ing man appeared before the curtain
Jas the performance was about to be
\ gin and announced in honeyed accents
! that the leading lady had such a se-
I vere cold, etc., and Miss Woodson
! would read the part. After it was all
[ over the ladies asserted vehemently'as
' they probed their hatpins home that
[ the ingenue had done "Just darling"
and their escorts readily assented more
grammatically. And something for
which the management did not apolo
gize and for which there was no need
of apology was the substitution of
Herbert Farjeon as stage director for
Fred J. Butler, -whoV was necessarily
absent.
The play was "The Girl and the
Judge", by Clyde Fitch, and was char
acteristically interesting and amusing.
The play will be reviewed to-night by
Blanche Partington.

new bill, providing for the transfer of
a large tract of the Yosemlte National
Park to the adjoining Sierra forest re
serve, which passed the House on Sat*
urday, came over to the Senate to-day
and was referred by request of a num
ber of that body to the Committee on
Forest Reserves. Senator Perkins' bill,
which is identical, both being the so
called administration or department
measures introduced some days ago,
had been referred to the Committee on
Public Lands.of which Bard is a mem
ber. This leaves two bills identical in
purpose, before two different com
mittees.
It is well understood that two differ*
ent railway companies have interested
themselves in this measure with the
Intention of taking advantage of the
widening of the boundaries of the
Sierra forest reserve to approach the
Yosemite Valley. One of these leads
in from Merced and would be enabled
by the operation of the bill to make a
much closer approach to the valley
than the other from Fresno.
The Fresnoites were very wroth
over the passage of the earlier bill
and were pleased when it was held up
by the President, confident that the
recommendations of the commission
appointed to investigate the matter of
the transfer, and the report of which
had not yet been printed, would If
followed better their case. The new
Gillett and Perkins bills prepared
since, according to these recommenda*
tions, are found not to have helped
the Fresno line. This line, because of
topographical conditions, is compelled
in order to get a proper grade, to go
beyond the line of the forest reserve
even as extended by the new bill.
Threfore the Fresno interests have
been sending telegrams to members of
the California delegation, asking them
to delay the passage of the bill. The
telegmms have been signed by Frank
H. Short.
Senator Bard made answer that he
would secure them a hearing If they
were on hand In a few days. but x that
the new park boundaries recommend
ed by the commission and approved by
the President could not again be
changed. Gillett. of course, is anxious
to speed his bill.
With the knowledge of this proposed
delay, it is thought the Merced inter
ests have made a flank movement and
through a Senator, not aware of the
situation, had the bill referred "by re
quest" to a committee other than
Bard's. Bard nronoses to call the mat
ter to the attent on of the President
of the Senate to-morrow.
LIGHT ON POLITICAL
METHODS OF CARRIERS
Wynne Sends Matter to House Show
ing Plan to Effect a B ti gain.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 16.âPostmas
ter General Wynne transmitted to the
House to-day "a statement of facts"
relative to the dismissal on December
IC, 1904, of J. C. Keller, president of
the City Letter-Carriers' Association
and Frank Cunningham. Warren Turn
ber and H. W. Aldrich, officers- of the
Rural Carriers' Association.
The campaign of the Rural Carriers
for an increase of pay is set forth in
the communication in a number of
circular letters credited to the three
named carriers.
In one letter it was proposed that
Representative Overstreet should give
out a "newspaper interview to the ef
fect that at a coming session he would
allow to be* reported out of the post
office committee the Fairbanks bill
Uhe situation in Indiana is that Fair
banks will be defeated; the Republi
cans are of the opinion and should be
glad of a chance to make this trade).
Then what? This interview will be
flashed all over the country by the As
sociated Press, that Overstreet will do
this.
"We will then get in our work of
petting Congressmen and candidates to
Lcmmit themselves to vote for the bill.
We will then get out the Free Deliv
ery News with an extra whooping-up
of Overstreet; that he is not such a
bad fellow after all. and urge the car
riers to support the whole ticket.
"But If Cortelyou does not agree to

I ceived.
The credit for the most artistic per- '
I formance must be given to Edna Ells
mere, who played the wronged girl
\ with genuine pathos and feeling. Myr
â , tie Vane, as a Harriganesque tough
â  girl, was very clever, and seemed thor
oughly to enjoy the part. Maggie
i Frances Leavy, in a short part, was
: very good, and little Martine, her
I daughter, is a bright and talented
child. The others in the cast were ac
ceptable.
The Chutes.
Montgomery and Cantor, -singing
and dancing comedians, one of whom
U a very clever pianist, made their
first appearance at the Chutes yester-
J day and scored a hit at both per
i ft-rmances. The Kale Duo gave a
j capital exhibition of club juggling,

singing and dancing Irish comedian,
Ernest Wilson and Marie Leicester, in
their pretty act, "Love Stories Told in
Song," and the American Blograph,
showing realistic and remarkable mov

gramme. The feature of the amateur

they were escorted by the detectives to
their flat, where, they surrendered to
the detectives $1000 worth of diamonds,
$1000 worth of fine dresses and seal

said they did not know Smith had been
stealing. He had promised to marry
Rita, they said, as soon as he got a
divorce from his present wife, who is
an invalid.

GOSSIP ABOUT
THE AFFAIRS
OF SMART SET
BY ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE.
OAKLAND, Jan. 16.âEvery winter a few
members of Oakland's smart set take up tem
porary headquarters in San Francisco, but for
some reason the exodus has been unusually
great this year. Many have taken their goods
and chattels, and gone over the bay to reside
permanently, and in every instance Oakland
ha* been the loser, for they have been among
our most lavish entertainers. Perhaps that ac
counts for the dearth of important social func
tions lately.
Small card parties and informal teas keep
our social life stirring to a certain extent, but
of all the beautiful homes here that afford
ample scope for brilliant and memorable affairs
there are very few that throw open their doors
in the hospitable fashion of former days.
The Country Club is doing considerable just
new to revive a commendable social spirit,
nearly every day witnessing a dinner-dance or
some other form of entertainment in the ele
gant clubrooms in Claremont. Even the F. M.
Smiths, with one of the most beautiful homes
in Oakland, followed the fashion of the hour
Saturday evening and gave an elaborate dinner
at the Country Club. Their guests of honor
were Mrs. Harold Mason and daughters. Misses
Winifred and Mabel Mason, of Sausalito.
By the by, the subscription dance that was
to have taken place at the Country Club on
the 20th has been postponed to the 25th, as
the first mentioned date would have conflicted
with the Friday Night Cotillon. Nearly all of
the dancing act belong to the Friday Night
Club.

Among the latest to contemplate the desert

the metropolis are the Willard Williamsons.
They are planning to leave this week for a
temporary residence on Washington street,
pending the completion of the home they are
building out near the Presidio. Their going
will be a distinct loss to the local smart set,
tor Mrs. Williamson Is not only one of the
most beautiful young matrons In society, but
her unfailing graclbusness and vivacious charm
have made her an acquisition to every social
function. She has been a frequent entertainer
and is an Ideal hostess.
Last Friday afternoon Mrs. Williamson waa
the guest at an informal "4 o'clock" given by
Miss Maud Edith Pope, who has been enter
taining considerably of late.
Mr. and Mrs. W. E. Miles have also Joined
the ranks of deserters, and hereafter will be
found domiciled at the Luxor, In San Francisco,
where Mrs. Miles will be ready to see her
friends every first Thursday. It was hoped at
first that Mr. and Mrs. Miles had gone for the
winter only, but the Montell Taylors have pur
chased therr artistic little Webster-street home,

and highly esteemed family and their many
friends will learn with pleasure of Miss
Lavenson's approaching happiness, for Mr.
Kahn is not only popular as a merchant bot Is
said to be a "fine fellow."
The affianced pair met under distressing
circumstances while traveling in Europe. Miss
Lavenson was suddenly bereaved by the death
of her mother while in Frankfort, and as Mr.
Kahn and his sister. Mrs. Zeimer. were there
at the time, they promptly took charge of the
orphaned girl. The warm friendship that

PRIMARY LAW
IS HELD SOUND
Effort Made by Socialists to
Stop Calling Election Un
der Present Act Fails
INJUNCTION IS DENIED
Judge Holds That Provisions
Are General and Ap
ply Alike to All Parties
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 16.
The constitutionality of the primary
election law was upheld by Judge
Henry A. Melvin in a decision handed
down to-day in the case of M. Lesser,
representing the Socialist party, against
the City Council, In whir/h Lesser asked
for an injunction to restrain the city
officials from calling a primary election
for the 31st of the present month, on
three grounds: First, that secrecy
in voting is not preserved; second, that
the law arbitrarily classifies voters and
discriminates between classes; third,
because it destroys the right of self
preservation of political parties and
impairs the rights of citizens to assem
ble together and instruct their repre
sentatives.
Judge Melvin spoke thus:
The law has given the Legislature very ex
tensive powers in relation ti> tlie passage of
laws governing primary elections, particularly
In the matter of "tests and conditions" upon
which electors, political parties or organizations
cf voters may participate in any primary elec
tion.
Counsel say that the members of a party
advocating unpopular doctrines might thus be
subjected to persecution by those holding an
tagonistic theories, and that such persecution
would be made easy because the roster of those
voting at a primary election is a public docu
ment, ot which certified copies may be obtained
by any one.
In all ages men have been injured mora or
less by those whose ill will arises from politi
cal differences. It Is clear to me, however,
that the requirement for the declaration of
one's political faith, being general in Its appli
cation to all voters, is In accordance with the
provision of the constitution applicable to such
elections.
Upon this finding the demurrer of
City Attorney McElroy, appearing for
the City Council, was sustained and the
petition for the writ denied.
CITY TO VOTE
ON WATER PLAN
Ordinance for Bond Election
on March 11 Is Passed to
Print by Oakland Council
Oakland Office Saa Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 18.
The City Council to-night passed to
print by unanimous vote an ordinance
calling the bond election for the sub
mission of the Bay Cities Water Com
pany's municipal water supply project
for Saturday, March 11, two days be
fore the city municipal election. The
ordinance calls for the issuance of
bonds for $5,700,000 to purchase the
proposed water supply and equipment
at $3,750,000 with $1,950,000 for a dis
tributing system in the city. The
bonds are to be serials, running for
f6rty years, with interest at 4 per cent.
Before the ordinance was read. At
torney R. M. Fitzgerald for the Bay
Cities Company announced that the
corporation would agree further to
safeguard the city against adverse
claims by giving a bond in the full
amount of the payment for the works,
or it would agree to place In escrow
all payments from the city until the
plant should be complete and deliv
ered to the city, free and clear of all
Incumbrance.
"In short the company," Fitzgerald
said, "will arrange so the city cannot
possibly lose a dollar if the company
does not fill its agreement."
A communication from the company
covering this matter was filed with the
Council. Councilman Howard in vot
ing for the passage to print of the
ordinance said:
"As a Councilman I shall vote for
this ordinance because it will cost no
more to pass It up to the people than
not to do so under the agreement
with the company. Secondly, I think
the people want an opportunity to vote
on this proposition. But as a private
citizen, I shall vote against the Bay
Cities proposition because I think it
is immature and indefinite, and I be
lieve the action of the Council Is not
well considered and is not business
like."
Councilman Howard added that he
made this explanation of his vote in
order to be consistent with his dec
larations last week on the municipal
water question. Howard read a pa
per advocating the establishment of a
municipal salt water pumping plant
for street sprinkling purposes, and for
fire protection in the business district.

VINE EXPERT
BACK FOR TOIL
[ Professor Bioletti Returns
From Three Years of Ar
duous Study in New Lamb
HAS ACHIEVED HONORS
- â " ' â¦
Results of Experiments in
Africa and Europe to Be
Used on California. Vines
Berkeley office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center street, Jan. 16.
After three years of study and ex
perimenting in South Africa and
Europe, Professor Frederick T. Bio
letti returned to-day to the University
of California, to occupy an important
position wherein his work is expected
to be of great value to the viticuliural
interests of the State.
Professor Bioletti is to be professor
of viticulture. Although he is official
ly referred to as an "assistant profes
sor" he is practically supreme In his
department, as he has neither superior
nor associate in his particular field. He
is to apply the results of three years*
work abroad to the solving of prob
lems that affect the wine and grape
industry of California, and is to have
free rein'in making use of knowledge
gained in foreign countries.
The friction that was feared might
follow Professor Bioletti's return to
the university, because of Professor
Twighfs objection to Bioletti's taking
equal rank in the same department
with him, has been obviated by Pro
fessor Twight's decision to remain
with the university, but to assume the
title of lecturer in the department, be
ing independent of Professor Bioletti
or any other instructor.
Bioletti's advancement in his field is
looked upon by observers as phenom
enally rapid. Three years ago he
left a position here where he was rated
as merely an instructor", an inferior po
sition, to accept a* Government place
as chemist and vlticultural expert in
South Africa. He served in Africa
with distinction, producing valuable
results and earning a name and repu
tation that was considered enviable.
His recall to the University of Cali
fornia came last summer, when he
was offered the place and rank of an
assistant professor with salary and
powers correspondingly Increased. He
accepted the offer, with the proviso
that he be permitted to spend three
months before his return to this coun
try in study of viticultural conditions
in Algeria and Southern Europe. The
permission was granted, and it is from
these fields that Professor Bioletti has
just come.
He says that methods of winemakers
in Europe have been signally changed
during the last few years, notably by
the use of cultures of pure yeast In the
making of wine. Professor Bioletti
â¢ays that many of the diseases hither

:. W. H. Desborough, 610 Fillmore

attention was directed to a peculiar
noise at his front door and on look
ing- out of a window he saw a young
mkn attempting to pick the lock. Des
borough was too surprised to do any
thing and he allowed the young man
to'.walk away.
. 'Fhe young man returned in a few
minutes and again started to pick the
rock. Desborough ran downstairs and
quickly opened the front door. "What
do you want here?" he queried In an
angry tone. "How stupid of me," re
plied the youth; "I thought this was
my own house."
' ""Is that so?" said Desborough, as
he .'grabbed hold of the youth and,
turning him round, kicked him down
the front steps and into the street.
r ltho youth fled along Fillmore street,
ix-sl.orrtugh after thinking the mat
ter over went in search of a police
man, regretting his stupidity in allow
ing the burglar to escape.

MINISTERS CALL
OFF CONVENTION
Committee Votes to Yield
Big Gathering Which Was
Won for San Francisco
MAY TIDE OVER TROUBLE
Dr. Case Pays Compliment to
the Legislature's Unusual
High Tone and Character
It may depend on the outcome of
an Interview to-day between the con
j vention committee of the Christian
Church and the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company's representatives
whether the promised big internation
al gathering shall take place In San
Francisco or some city In the East
next August.
It was decided by the committee
yesterday that in view of no reply
having been received to the letter sent
the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe
Railroad companies on January 9 rela
tive to reduced rates for the conven
| tlon, the ultimate decision of the com
| mittee will go into effect, which means
j the calling off of the International af
| fair so far as San Francisco is con
! cerned.
| The Rev. Walter M. White, D. D..
told the meeting that "their letter had
been ignored" and the question before
them was whether they had better not
throw ud all idea of holding the con
vention in San Francisco.
The doctor said that such a move on
his part and of his ministerial breth
ren would cost them great pain since
they had been battling to win the con
vention for San Francisco for the last
eight years even against strong oppo
sition in the East.
He held that the bringing of 8000 or
10.000 people to San Francisco meant
an immense benefit for the State, but
he-regretted that if they could not get
the rate which had been verbally
promised at St. Louis he could not ad
vise the holding of the convention here
for the reason that the greater part of
the people would not come unless the
rate was granted.
YIELD THE CONVENTION.
The Rev. F. A. Boyer of Oakland,
the Rev. E. W. Darst of Berkeley, the
Rev. P. C. Macfarlane of Alameda, the
Rev. Frank S. Ford and the Rev. Mr.
Berry of San Francisco were in ac
cord with the views of Dr. White and
It was unanimously resolved to wire
the Rev. B. L. Smith, secretary of the
Home Mission Society, Cincinnati,
Ohio, announcing that the committee
had resolved under the circumstances
to yield the convention.
Shortly after the close of the meet
ing the railroad officials were In com
munication with Dr. White and in
formed him that a letter had been
sent in answer to the one written by
the committee on January 9. The
doctor assured them that it had not
been received. Dr. White said that the
officials had requested an interview
with the convention committee,
quently he and Dean Van Kirk and
the Rev. Mr. Macfarlane will meet
James Horsburg Jr. and Charles S.
Fee of the Southern Pacific Company
sometime to-day.
The Merchants' Association, said
the doctor, had promised to do all in
its power to bring the convention to
San Francisco.
The question of betting on races and
the existence of poolrooms came be
fore the Methodist Ministers' Associa
tion yesterday. Dr. E. R. Dille sub
mitted the following resolution which
was unanimously carried:
WOULD STOP GAMBLING.
Whereas, A measure has been introduced by
Hen. R. H. E. into the California Legis
lature the effect of which will be to suppress
the Iniquitous race track and poolroom gam
bling, which is such a curse to our State.
Resolved, That we favor tlie passage of ths
above measure and urge our legislators to sup
port it to the end that this evil so damaging
to our commercial Interests and moral welfare
may be entirely done away with.
In the discussion which followed Dr.
W. W. Case said that the tone and
character of the Legislature were so
unusually high that he considered
there was a strong sentiment in favor
of the purport of the resolution.
Reference was made to the saloons
in the vicinity of the Presidio and it
was decided to include the matter of
their removal in the resolution.
The Rev. Henry A. Fisk addressed
the Presbyterian Ministers' Association
yesterday on the advance made by the
People's Place, Greenwich street, be
tween Powell and Mason streets. The
Baptist Ministers' Association was ad
dressed by the Rev. Robert Whltaker,
and the Rev. B. F. Sargent spoke be
fore the Congregational Ministers' As
sociation.
ROBINSON MURDERER
SOON TO BE TRIED HERE
Governor of Minnesota Agrees to Al
low Police to Take Alan Goucher
Before Sentence Expires.
Within the next three weeks Alan
Goucher, alias "Kid" Goucher. the
only one of the six thugs implicated
in the murder of Policeman Eugene
C. Robinson at Sixteenth and Valencia
streets on January 21, 1902, who has
not yet been tried, will be brought
here from the penitentiary at Stillwa
ter, Minn., to stand his trial. It was
only a few months ago that Chief
Wittmnn learned that Goucher was
serving a term in the Stillwater Peni
tentiary.
When Willi/am Henderson, one of
the thugs who turned State's evidence,
appeared before Judge Cook again
yesterday to be sentenced, District At
torney Byington said he had received
a communication from the Governor
of Minnesota that Goucher would be
pardoned so as to enable the authori
ties here to take him before the ex
piration of his term. The requisition
papers would be made out at once and
he exDected to have Goucher here
within the next three weeks.
Henderson, who has been detained
to give evidence at Goucher's trial,
withdrew all of his* former demands
for sentence to be passed upon him
and through his attorney asked for a
continuance till January 27, which was
granted. Detective Taylor will go to
Stillwater for Goucher as soon as the
requisition papers are ready.
Threatened Wife's Life.
Mrs. Louisa Graves, residing at 69
Tehama street, swore to a warrant
yesterday charging her husband with
threats against life. Graves and his
wife have been separated for some
time, and, according to the woman,
her life has been threatened several
times. Yesterday she told Judge Fritz
he came to her residence on Tehama
street and took away a 5-year-old
child. It is alleged that Graves re
marked to some of the neighbors that
he would dispose of the little one, as
he knew his wife cherished it. The
warrant was placed in the hands of
the police, but up to a late hour last
night neither husband nor child had
been located.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 17, 1905.
SLEUTH WILKIE
LANDS IN JAIL
Secret Service Agents Take
in a Private Detective
for False Representation
RECEIVES ADMONITION
He Is Cautioned Not to Use
Names of Federal Officials
Orally or on Stationery
C. H. Wilkie. general manager of
"The C. H. Wilkie Detective Service,"
was taken into custody yesterday aft
noon by United States Secret Service
Agents George W. Hazen and John
Cronin.
Wilkie's letterheads and cards repre
sented that the business was "conduct
ed on the system of the United States
Secret Service"; that it was established
in 1884; that C. H. Wilkie was its gen
eral manager, R. I* Holllday Its secre
tary and treasurer and R. P. Riley its
superintendent. Wilkie had been rep
resenting himself to be a cousin of
John E. Wilkie, chief of the Secret
Service Department of the United
States.
Agent Cronin called at the agency,
632 Market street, yesterday morning,
and introduced himself as being con
nected with the Los Angeles Traction
Company, and in search of a private
detective to watch certain persons in
Los Angeles. Wilkie told him that he
had been employed for six years in the
United States Secret Service and that
he was a cousin of Chief Wilkie. Agent
Hazen next had an interview with the
pretender, and received similar infor
mation. On being taken to Hazen's
office the detective admitted that his
representations as to being Chief Wil
kie's cousin, and as to having been six
years or six minutes in the United
States Secret Service were false. He
maintained that his name was Charles
Herbert Wilkie; that he had been en
gaged in Colorado with Colonel Wil
liam Cody (Buffalo Bill) in rounding up
cattle rustlers, and that he was doing
a legitimate business. He said that
he arrived here from Pittsburg two
months ago with $300. and rented the
office at 632 Market street for $11 per
month, but that all his money was
gone. The only client appearing on his
books was Judson C. Brusie, agent for
a fidelity and guarantee company, who
had engaged Wilkie at $6 per diem to
hunt up Gee Gew, a Chinese, for whom

WILL CONTEST
IS SUCCESSFUL
Judge Kerrigan Decides in
Favor of the Nephew and
Niece of Mrs. Krzyanowski
A decision in favor of the nephew
and niece of Palagia Maria Kryzanow
ski, in their contest of that eccentric
woman's will, was rendered yesterday
by Judge Kerrigan, who has had the
case under advisement for several
weeks. The winners are Aloyzy Syl
vester Borkowski, who lives some
where in Poland, and his sister, An
tonina Borkowski Ogonowska of
Schenectady, N. Y. The lpsers are At
torney George H. Perry, to whom the
interest of Charles Rickman, the de
ceased beneficiary under the will, was
assigned, and Rickman's two sons,
who would have shared In the residue
after Perry had taken out his 25 per
cent.
The court was satisfied with the
proof of relationship of the niece and
nephew and judged from the evidence
that Madame Krzyanowski was incom
petent to make a will, when she signed
the testament leaving nearly all of her
$150,000 estate to Charles Rickman, a
pickle peddler. When the will was
made, the woman was hi a hospital,,
suffering from a paralytic stroke. She
died less than a month later.
Of the original $30,000 only about
$11,000 remains and there is another
obstacle in the way of its distribution
to the niece and nephew.* The Rick
man interests hold an assignment of
the rights of Marie Nightingale in the
estate and now that the will has been
broken, will try to prove that she Is
the daughter of the deceased and. her
heir at law. Under this claim of re
lationship Marie Nightingale filed a
contest against the will before it was
admitted to probate in February,
1903. The case was tried in Judge
Troutt's court, but before It was sub
mitted to the jury the alleged daugh
ter accepted $10,000 as a compromise
and assigned her interest to Rickman.
Perry received $1000 for his fees and
other allowances were made which re
duced the estate to its present propor
tions.
Witnesses in the trial of the case
testified that Madame Kryzanowski
claimed to belong to the nobility of
Poland. She was married three times
and her third husband was a general
in the civil war in this country. In
her latter days she lived in squalor, in
spite of her fortune.

George A. Kohn said that the loss was
trivial and had been made good. He

Coghill said:
The stories regarding the alleged embezzle

School Superintendent Langdon offl-
I cially notified the Supervisors' Finance
I Committee yesterday that a bill which
; has been introduced in the State Leg
i islature fixing the State's apportlon
| ment to the school funds of the vari
| ous vounties would, if adopted, reduce
I the school revenue of this city from
j that source by $215,495. The bill pur
! ports to allow $300 yearly for each
! teacher in the State and the rest of
; the school income is based on the
j actual enrollment of pupils Instead of
! the school census as at present. Lang
j don said that a committee of three
I teachers had been appointed to urge
the Board of Supervisors, the Mer
chants' Association and other civic or
ganizations to oppose the measure.
"The bill does not accomplish the
purpose which Governor Pardee has
sought," said Supervisor D'Ancona,
"namely to add to the funds of out
lying school districts. It diminishes
the tax rate for school purposes, but
its effect will be to lessen the revenue
iof the San Francisco schools. I have
[ requested our clerk to prepare data
| for presentation to the Legislature as
! arguments against the passage of the
j bill."
"I understand that the San Fran-
I Cisco delegation will oppose the bill,
j as will also the legislators from a few
i other counties whose school income
' would be reduced," said Langdon.
i M. Regensburger appeared before
i the Finance Committee and urged the
i return of $201 license paid for the
j "Clneograph" from July 1, 1904, to
; July 1, 1905. Regensburger said the
' owner of the place had been refused a
permit by the Board of Public Works
\ and had closed it on January 1. Tax
Collector Smith reported that the sum
i of $2211 had been paid in advance for
I licenses by eleven theaters to which
1 refusal had been made because they
;do not comply with the theater ordi
nance and which are now operating
! without licenses, although the money
I therefor had been paid to the city. No
; action was taken, pending a report
j from the Board of Public Works,
! which has the matter of granting per
' mits under consideration,
i The committee began an inquiry
; into the evasion of the payment of 11
--| cense taxes by owners of teams em
, ployed by the Board of Public Works.
! The teams are not owned by the city
j and the committee takes the ground
j that the fees should be paid. Tax
j Collector Smith will endeavor to col
i lect the money.
The resolution granting permits to
various persons to conduct hospitals
and sanitariums was rereferred to the
Health Committee. A protest has been
filed against the granting of a permit
to Drs. Hunsaker and Harvey at 2119
California street.
Acting on the recommendation of
the Finance Committee the Board of
Supervisors allowed out of the urgent

of fifty beds urgently needed for the
County Hospital aid $1100 for the
equipment of the nurses' quarters at

RESULT NOT IN DOUBT
Moneyed Institutions Are
to Merge Interests and
Center Their Business
It is announced by I. W. Hellman Jr.
that the Wells, Fargo & Co. Bank and
the Nevada National Bank of San
Francisco will merge their capital and
interests under the corporate name of
the Wells-Fargo Nevada National
Bank, with a capital of $6,000,000 and a
surplus of $8,500,000. The division and
disposition of this capital between the
several interests, so said Mr. Hellman
yesterday, is a matter to be determined
finally by the stockholders of the re
spective companies. The proportions
have been decided upon by the officers
and directors of the two banks.
Some time will elapse before the final
consolidation of interests can be ef
fected, as the Nevada National Bank
stockholders will have to be called to
gether, and thirty days' notice of the
meeting must be given. Various mat
ters of detail regarding the business of
Wells, Fargo & Co. will take some time
to settle. Mr. Hellman says the com
bined assets of the two banks after
consolidation will approximate $30,000,
--000, which* will make one of the strong
est and largest banks in the United
States. The purpose is to conduct all
the business in one building. The cler
ical forces of both institutions will be
provided for.
The deal between the Bank of Cali
fornia and the London and San Fran- ]
Cisco Bank, Limited, for the purchase
by the first named of the latter, has
reached the stage of a provisional;
agreement between the two banks. Un- ,
der this the Bank of California, ac
cording to a press dispatch from Lon
don, offers to pay about $76 for each $50 j
share to the British shareholders, who
will be called together in February to
vote on the question of the merger.
Cashier Black of the London and San
Francisco Bank says that the agree
ment Is to purchase the stock of the
London and San Francisco Bank at $75 i
a share and the deal includes the busi
ness, good will and realty of the bank.
Circulars signed by Manager Mack
intosh and Cashier Black of the Lon
don and San Francisco Bank, and Vice
President Anderson of the Bank of
California, have been Issued in which
announcement is made that a provi
sional agreement has been reached.
The Bank of California will, after con
solidation, according to present plans,
erect a large building on the northwest
corner of California and Sansome
streets, on the site of the old-time
building, owned and occupied as a j
banking structure.

LET US NOT BE BARBAROUS.
THE time has come when the good name of California requires j
that the mobbing of Chinese and Japanese shall cease. Those
people are here in the exercise of their treaty rights and statu
tory privileges. These treaties and statutes are made by the con
stitution the supreme law of the land. If that law is wrong it may
be amended or repealed, but it would be a cowardly Congress that â 
would repeal it or abrogate a treaty at the behest of mobs. If that
were done then we should repeal all laws that suffer infraction by
mobs. That part of the criminal code that is violated by lynching
mobs should in that case be repealed and Judge Lynch be substi--'
tuted for the judicial courts. To do either of these things is to
turn the country over to mobs, which will take the place of the
courts of first instance and of last resort.
As far as the employment of these Asiatics is concerned there i
is not an employer in California who does not prefer white labor if
it be equally reliable, leaving out all question of wages. The fruit
interest of this State has reached colossal proportions. Fruit is
perishable property. Its ripening does not wait. It must be har
vested and put into market promptly or the producer loses his whole
season. The fruit growers who employ Chinese labor must have it
said in justification that they take that labor because of its reliability,
and not for its cheapness, for it is no longer cheap. Japanese labor
is less reliable, but while a Japanese works he works, and renders
an equivalent for his wages. The labor of both is mobile, and moves
readily to the place where it is wanted. It would not be wanted
anywhere if those who mob it did not create the conditions that
make it necessary.
The Call is no friend to the presence of Asiatic labor here, but
it came originally by invitation of the people of California. In no
other part of the country wa* the original Burlingame treaty hailed
with such effusion and enthusiasm as here. When Koopmanschap
brought the considerable number of Chinese here, following that
treaty, there was practically an expression of public rejoicing at
their coming. <'.rant that their labor was at that time cheap. It
found its level. The whole fruit industry of this State was founded
not upon its cheapness, but upon its reliability and industry. There
is hardly a large pioneer fruit grower in the State who does not in
sist that this industry was based originally upon the adaptation of
the Chinese. There are many large fruit growers now who insist
that the growing scarcity of this reliable and adapted labor imperils
the whole fruit interest.
Here then is an industrial condition that must be faced, and a
problem that must be solved. If mobs refuse permission to the
Japanese and Chinese to labor, the fruit industry must contract and
perish down to the proportion in which white labor will do the work
required to maintain it. If it prove that we have made a mistake in
basing the industry in its present proportions upon the reliability of
a kind of labor that is not to be permitted, we must bravely face the
consequences and pocket the loss. But for the sake of the State's
good name let us not delegate to mobs the expression of our ac
ceptance of the inevitable.
Through our own mobs we may see as through a lens our own
attitude toward China, taken because the presence of white people
in that empire was objected to by a certain class which expressed its
objection precisely as mobs here express objection to Asiatics. For
that the civilized world sent armies to China, and thousands of Chi
nese were killed, their towns were destroyed, their treasure looted
and woe unutterable was spread abroad, not sparing the innocent or
the guilty. With what face can we justify this sore punishment of
Asiatics while we permit and countenance here the same acts toward
them which we punished them for inflicting upon white men? It
is time that this issue be taken out of the hand of mobs, and that its
adjustment be assumed by men who love reason and right. Our
Government should firmly refuse to consider any policy in its in
ternational relations that is expressed by a mob. To surrender to
such force is to subject us to international shame.
THE RECESSION OF YOSEMITE.
IN answer to ihe somewhat hysterical agitation against the re
cession to the National Government of the Yosemite Valley,
which is receivThg impetus from certain sources, the State Board
â¢of Trade has issued a pamphlet covering the whole discussion in a
perfectly sane and unimpassioned manner. The pamphlet also con
tains a lengthy list of municipal boards of trade, civic organizations
and improvement associations throughout the State that have shown
by their unanimity of action a general indorsement of the proposed
measure.
The Board of Trade's arguments take the perfectly tenable
ground that the recession of our Sierra beauty spot will be for the
ultimate benefit of the State itself, for under the control of Federal
Government such exploitation of the beauties of the valley and im
provement of its avenues of entrance and egress can be made as
to increase immediately the influx of tourists from the East. Under
the meager appropriations which have been made by the Slate Leg
islature, however aptly distributed they may be by our Park Com
. jnissioners. accommodations of travel and camping facilities must
necessarily remain cramped and inadequate and prospective visitors
may be again denied admittance to the valley as they were in the
summer of 190$.
Comparison between the Government expenditures upon the ;
Yellowstone National Park and State appropriations for Yosemite
i- in itself after all the most efficient recommendation for the re
cession of the State's trust. Federal appropriations for the mainte
nance of the Yellowstone during the years 1903-04 totaled $462,571:
during the same time our Legislature could allow to Yosemite a 1
meager $37,500 only, and this, in the words of one of the legislators, 'â 
was "a mighty hard squeeze." Does the State do itself justice in
continuing a supervision over the valley upon so slim a financial
basis as this? Better that the National Government take over our
valley wonderland and make of it a park second not even to the
Yellowstone.
LESSENING DESERT PERILS.
IN order that the perils of the desert may be lessened State Min
eralogist Lewis E. Anbury is to seek an appropriation from the
Legislature providing for the erection of signboards and the
digging of wells along the most frequented desert trails in the
southern part of the State. Declaring that the sum of $5000 would
be ample to cover the expense of this humane innovation, the State
mineralogist sees in the projected measure direct benefit for a large
part of the mining industry now- remaining partially undeveloped un
der the haunting shadow of death that lurks ever over the waste
places.
Mr. Aubury's scheme is a commendable one. Too often harrow
ing tales come out of the wilderness of alkali and sand of men
found dead from thirst and of prospectors unfamiliar with the coun
try wandering from the thin trails and becoming demented under
the awful influence of the evil genius that haunts the region. The
dazzle of gold in the very midst of piled up bones has lured many a
luckless miner to his certain destruction. Yet the gold is there, and
gems and valuable chemical deposits; some of the State's richest
mineral deposits lie within this region of thirst and insanity. The full
development of these resources cannot come until the ring of terrors
hedging them about is broken.
Should the Legislature grant Aubury's plea for a modest ap
propriation it is certain that Kern. San Diego, San Bernardino and
Inyo counties, the ones to be benefited indirectly by the innovation,
will find it to their profit to co-operate with the Mining Bureau in the
prosecution of the work. A work of mercy it would be, but also a
work of development.

HELP

TOMMY loved " Big Sister" and so
did Jack Sutton. Betty Travers
loved Tommy openly and Jack
Sutton secretly. Tommy liked
Sutton, but somehow this affec
tion was not reciprocated. And this
was the way matters stood when Sut
ton came upon Betty and Tommy in
the Chicago sleeper.
"Such a pleasant suprise," smiled
Betty, as she extended a smoothly
gloved hand in greeting. "I was afraid
it would lÂ»e such a dreary trip."
Sutton glowed.
"We can have lots of fun," supple
mented Tommy, slipping a moist and
uncomfortably sticky hand into Sut
ton's.
Sutton glowered.
Betty Travers was not the sort of
girl to wear her upon her sleeve.
For more than a year Sutton had
sought to learn his fate, and Betty,
woman-like, had parried his every at
tempt. This was his opportunity. If
only Tommy
"Won't you sit down?" asked Betty,
hospitably making room for him on
the seat across the way.
"I'm sorry," said Sutton boldly, "but
1 cannot ride with my l>ai k to the en
gine."
"I can ride with my back to the en
gine," said Tommy, proud that he pos
sessed accomplishments not enjoyed by
his elders. To prove it. he slipped into
the facing seat and Sutton sank down
beside the girl. He felt a sudden de
sire to buy Tommy candy, but the
newsboy was on the car ahead.
The rush of the train made it pos
sible for Sutton to speak
after a few conventional remarks he
plunged boldly Into the subject next
his heart.
"Do you know," lie asked, "that I
have wanted just this chance to talk
with you alone for a long time?"
* "Solitude in a crowd," she suggested
uneasily, glancing at a man across the
ais'e who seemed unduly interested.
"This is better than a ballroom," he
protested, "or at theater. I want to ask
you if "
"Look at the cows!" shouted Tommy,
precipitating himself into his sister's
lap and pointing wildly at the flying
landscape.
"I wanted to ask you." continued Sut
ton, "if there is anything I have done
to cause you to avoid me. you "
"I've got a cow, too," shouted Tom
my from the opposite seat. "I keep it
out at grandma's."
"That's a good place for it," said
Sutton to Tommy. Then turning to
Betty, he resumed:
"You seem to be afraid to give me a
moment alone with you. Do you fear
that I shall "
"Do tricks," demanded Tommy,
climbing upon Sutton's knee. Sutton

performed some simple parlor magic,
and the boy, satisfied, turned his at
tention to* the window.
"Are you afraid of the question I
want to ask, and which means so much
to me?" he urged. *
"I have not tried to avoid you," she
said blushing prettily. "I'm sure I've
given you a lot of my time this sea
son."
"Yes," he agreed, ' but for months I
have tried to tell you something, and
you have evaded me just as you are
trying to do now."
"I don't think this is evading you."
she laughed, glancing down at the
broad Ehoulder so close to her own.
"But this is the first time." he per
sisted, "and you couldn't help yourself.
You must have seen that "
"We're going over a big river!"
shouted Tommy gleefully. "Look at
the boats."
Betty took advantage of the diver
sion, and it was several minutes be
fore Sutton could lead the talk back
into the proper channel.
"We have been friends for so long,"
he said finally. "Won't you tell me
whether there is any possibility of mv
everâ *.'
"Going to stop," announced Tommy
as the train slowed down for a station.
"Take me for a walk."
"Please do." she pleaded. "The poor
little follew gets so tired and restless."
Dutifully Sutton led the lad up and
down the platform until he saw the
conductor coming away from the tele
graph window. Ten minutes more
were wasted by the young torment in
recounting his experience to Betty.
At last he subsided, and once more
Sutton sought toi learn his fate. "Don't
you know," he pleaded, "that I have
lcved you ever since I've known you?
Can't you say one little word to give
me hope that some dayâ"
"Lemme your watch," demanded
Tommy. Sutton passed over the hand
some timepiece without a word. If
it would keep the boy busy, he did not
( ;.re what happened.
"That some day." he went on. "I
may win you for my wife? I have
thought sometimes that I have been
so fortunate as to find favor in your
eyes, and then again I haveâ"
"Wheels!" demanded Tommy hand
ing back the watch. With a sudden
memory of what the back case con
tained. Sutton explained to the boy
thai the case did not open in the
back. Betty's face clouded. It might
hurt the works to open the case in all
this dust, but still â
Tommy had discovered the way to
make the hands go around by depress
ing the stem, and he was happy again.
"There have been times," continued
SuttOll, "when I have feared that
your avoidance of me was intentional,
and that you wanted to save me the
pain of refusal. No matter what your
answer may be, I want to know my
fate; to know whether I have any
chance to win the sweetest woman in
the world. Won't you tell me that
you do care for meâthat you will â"
"Wind it up," commanded Tommy.
With visions of dreadful fates, any
one of which w as too merciful for the
boy. Sutton took the watch and held
I* to his ear. The works had stop
ped.
In desperation he showed the boy
how to depress a boss on the side and
make the repeater strike the hour and
minute, and Tommy beaming, went
back to the other seat.
"Won't you give me an answer?"
Sutton pleaded. Her eyes grew- misty.
She wanted to answer, but somehow
she dreaded telling him on the cat.
The same fueling that had led her to
parry his proposal, now impelled her
to temporize. It was Tommy who
solved the situation. The watch flew
from his hands and clattered to the
floor.
"It just jumped out of my hands,"
explained the frightened boy. as he
s'A6 from the seat to pick it up. "The
back's broken off," he added in dis
may.
Sutton sprang for it, but the boy
was too quick for him. "It's got a pic
ture. Betty's picture," he cried as he
turned the cap over. "Do all watches
have nicturep in them?"
"No," said Sutton shortly, snapping
the cap back on the case.
"Betty's has," persisted the boy.
"Tommy. you mustn't fib," she
cried, turning a rosy red.
"Yes. it has," he Insisted, snatching
Third Matrimonial
Knot Is Severed
by Duchess.
j DUCHESS OF SUTHERLAND. |
DIFFERENCES between Mary,
Duchess of Sutherland, and
her third husband, Sir Albert
Rollit, have been so openly ex
pressed by both in the last six
j months that the announcement of
j their separation scarcely comes as
: news, says a London cable to the Phil
; adelphia North American.
The lawyers are busy, and in a
short while the matter will be for
mally carried through the courts.
The Duchess' pleasure at her release
is nothing to the delight of her hus
band, and Sir Albert celebrated his
freedom by sending out dinner invita
| tions to his intimate acquaintances,
few of whom he had been allowed to
keep up since his unsuitable alliance
with the widow of Arthur Kindersiey
Clair and the late Duke of Sutherland.
The Duchess is not on good terms
with her daughter. Miss Blair, who,
however, she is allowing to start as a
face specialist, and to whom she doles
out a pittance to the extent of a few
pounds weekly.
Although Sir Albert has returned all
the presents she ever gave him. she
refused to give up one single gift of
his. In the day of their courtship and
early marriage he bestowed on her a
wealth of jewels, including some per
fect ruby ornaments and a set of
matchless emeralds, as well as several
strings of pearls of great value.
TO PRESERVE
A HUSBAND
For this purpose select a nice, kind,
amiable, industrious, generous man.
The American variety is far better
than the foreign kind. Prepare him
by having him go through a long en
gagement, which effectually renders a |
man a soft thing and makes him easy
to handle. Gently detach him from all
oi his old friends and acquaintances
and remove any habits he may have.
He is then ready to can, preserve or
make jam, as you choose.
To can, merely deprive him of his
latchkey and throw a handful of
mother-in-law in the house. Men
corked up like this have been known
to keep for years without spoiling,
though when they are opened up, if ;
kept too long, they are apt to be sour. â 
To make jam,* prepare as before, but
shred all of his finer feelings by nag- j
ging and pound them into a pulp by
complaints. To preserve a husband,
put as much love into the heart as it
wifl hold, add an ocean of sympathy, j
a world of tenderness, a pound of for
bearance, a dram of patience and drop |
him into it until he is thoroughly
(oated over with sugar. Husbands i
should always be crystallized one at a '
time. Never in pairs. Neither should
they ever be stood in hot water. This
is where many women make mistakes.

Too Much for Melba.
A story is going the rounds of a party
at which Mme. Melba was singing.
The room was full, and the great prima
donna had just begun to sing when a
late comer sank into the only empty
chair. Immediately the sounds of
"Home, Sweet Home," mingled with
the notes of Mme. Melba's song. There
were indignant cries of "Sh-sh!" in
which the said late-comer joined, and
Mme. Melba stopped. But still "Home,
Sweet Home" went on, till some one
in authority summoned up courage to
tell the lady In question that the chair
she had taken was one with a musical
attachment and would go on playing
till she got up.

fair picture was the guest of honor. In
an exquisite robe of heavy pink silk,
with strings of pearls at her throat
and outlining a yoke of Irish point.
Likewise is she fair in personality, and

all of Mme. Roma's affairs the guests
were a delightful admixture of artists,
writers, musicians, army and society

FAVORS PLAN TO USE PLAYGROUNDS
AFTER SCHOOL HOURS.
Editor The Call: I was much inter
ested in the recommendation of Mr.
Langdon, the Superintendent of Public
Schools, as reported in this morning's
paper, that the yards or playgrounds of
our schools be thrown open after school
hours and on Saturdays.
All that he says is true and right in
line with the views expressed by Mr.
Riis in his lecture of last Monday
night.
To keep children off the streetÃ and
to provide for and supervise their rec
reation will do very much to improve
their morals and make good, healthy,
right-thinking men and women of
them. I want to offer a suggestion
that will, I think, help to carry out this
plan, viz., that young men who are
otherwise engaged, but have the leisure
time, be employed. There are soores of
young men in our medical schools and
colleges who would be glad to have the
opportunity to make the money.
This would insure having men of
high moral standard, which is of the
utmost importance, and at the same
time avoid the paying of large salaries,
which would be a temptation to those

The right man can make a play
ground such a pleasant and interest
ing place to boys that, to maintain dis
cipline, he need have recourse to no
other means than the withdrawal of
the privilege of playing for a limited

But to do so he must be able to en
thuse and share the feeling of the boys
âhe must organize the baseball nine
and the football eleven and make the
boys' interest his own.
In this way he may win the friend
ship of the boys and become their Ideal.
When he has reached that point his
influence over them is unbounded and
there is no measuring the good he may
do. He can instill right ideas, frown

This morning, in the clear intervals
that scattered the clouds, a sunspot of
unusual size was discernible, like a
black streak, extending visibly to the
naked eye In the northwest quadrant
of the solar disc. Measurement showed
that it was fully one-seventh of the

length and 80.000 in average width.
â¢Ten umbrae sprinkle the three pe

It may be a development of the stream
of average disturbances that extended
across the disc in December, though
it is not clearly Identifiable with any

have appeared since the great solar
rtorm of October. 1903, but they were
chiefly small or scattered, only about
ten being of medium dimensions.

BURTON TO GET
A NEW TRIAL
Held That Missouri Court
Had No Jurisdiction in
Case of Accused Senator
WASHINGTON THE PLACE
Effort to Be Made in the
Kansas Legislature to
Force His Kesignation
WASHINGTON, Jan. 16.âThe case
of Senator J. R. Burton was decided
by the United States Supreme Court
to-day. The court reversed the verdict
of the District Court for the Eastern
District of Missouri on the gTound
that the payments to Buron were
made in Washington. The District
Court was therefore reversed and the
case remanded for a new trial. The
opinion was handed down by Justice
Peckham, who took up the various
counts and recited the conclusions as
well as the divisions of the court.
As to the second count of guilt, it
is said that assuming that the statute
applies to the facts stated in the in
dictment, a further question arises
upon the general merits of the case,
whether there was sufficient evidence
of guilt to be submitted to the jury,
and a majority of the court is of the
opinion that there was, or is not pre
pared to say there was not, and the
minority dissents from that view and
is of the opinion that there was no
evidence whatever upon which to
found a verdict of conviction. The
decision further says:
This is not a case of the oommenotmect of a
crime in one district and it* completion In an
other, so that under the statute toe court In
either district has Jurisdiction. There was no
beginning of the offense in Missouri. The pay
ment of the money was In 'Washington, and
there was no commencement of that offense
when the officer of the Rlalto Company the
checks from St. Louis to the defendant. The
latter did not thereby begin an offense in Mis
souri.
Justice Peckham also took occasion
to comment upon the fact that when
the Jury came in with a disagreement,
the Judge asked how the Jury stood,
saying that the practice was one which
should not be encouraged.
The trial under the indictment
charging Senator Burton with receiv
ing a cash payment at St. Louis will
proceed immediately at that place.
The Department of Justice has not yet
considered the question of the trial
place of the Indictment alleging pay
ments in this city. It is possible the
statute of limitation may operate
against it.
In dissenting Justice Harlan says:
"It seems to me that in reversing the
Judgment upon the grounds stated in
the opinion the court has sacrificed
substance to mere form."
TOPEKA, Kans., Jan. 16.âA resolu
tion asking Senator Furton to resign
was introduced in ths Kansas House
and Senate this afternoon. Cyrus Le
land, leader of the deposed Republican
faction In Kansas, and a member of
the House, is the author of the resolu
tion. The matter will come up for
consideration to-morrow. An effort
will be made to table it on the ground
that the case of Senator Burton is yet
before the courts and the ore not a
subject for legislative action.
The Leland resolution re ites that
the decision of the United States Suv
preme Court to-day In the Burton
case necessarily deprives Burton of his
usefulness as a representative of the
State of Kansas in the United States
Senate.

CHICAGO DOCTOR TRACES
HEART DISEASE TO GRIP
Says Influenza Is Also the Most Im
portant Factor in Increase
of Pneumonia.
CHICAGO, Jan. 16.âInfluenza la
more prevalent and more fatal in Chi
cago this winter than at any time
since the epidemic year of 1891, ac
cording to the weekly bulletin of the
Health Department. Twenty more
deaths from this cause were reported
during the week.
Investigations by Dr. Robert B.
Preble, a medical Inspector for the de
partment, are held to show "there can
be no question that Influenza or la
grippe is the most Important factor in
the Increase of pneumonia and in con
sequence of heart disease,"
Statistics are quoted as proof that
the deaths from heart disease and
from pneumonia have Increased at al
most exactly the same ratio since
1843. The fact that the germ which
causes pneumonia also irritates the
membrane covering the valves of
the heart is commented on.

Tribunal.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 16.âThe lowa
Anti-Cigarette law was upheld by the
Supreme Court of the United States
to-day <n the two cases of Charles P.
Cook and Robert E. Hodge. The de
cision of the Supreme Court of lowa
was affirmed. The cigarettes were
shipped into the State in small paste

made that in enforcing the law the

The court refused, however, to hold
that the small boxes were original
packages and concluded that the ac
tion of the State authorities in assess

no violation of their constitutional

PIONEER FIRMS
CONSOLIDATED
L. D. Stone Company Buys
Out Main & Winchester
House on Private Terms
CHARLES MAIN SELLS
Retiring Manufacturer Has
Continuous Record That
Covers Fifty-Six Years
The business of the L. D. Stone
Company and that of Main & Winches
ter has been consolidated. A deal was
effected yesterday by which the first
named concern buys out the interest
of Charles Main. With this deal comes
to an end the old concern of Main &
Winchester. In the consolidation of
Interests that has been effected the
name of Winchester will not be un
known, as Frank Winchester is the
treasurer. Charles Main, an octogena
rian, the surviving partner of Main &
Winchester, which the the pioneer har
ness and saddlery concern on the Paci
fic Coast, retires from business, after an
unparalleled record of fifty-six years
of constant connection with one con
cern In San Francisco.
The officers of the L. D. Stone Com
pany have been A, G. Stoll, president;
R. P. Grubb, vice president; EÂ» M.
Lynn, secretary; R, M. Richardson,
treasurer. The consolidation makes
only a few changes. Frank Winches

nrdson is vice president. The other
officers are continued. At the offices of
the L. D. Stone Company yesterday it
was said that the consolidation will
mean the operation of th* business
of the two concern* Jointly. Each
Result of Boycott
The orlv place Â»n the United States
that guarantees freedom from strikes,
lockouts and labor warfare is Battle
Creek, Mloh.
The story? The workpeople, mer
chants, lawyers, doctors and other oiti
zens became aroused and Indignant at
the efforts of the labor unions through
out the country to destroy the business
of one of our largest Industrie*âthe
Postum Cereal Co., Ltd, and at the
open threats In the official union pa
pers that the entire power of the Na
tional State Federations of Labor was
being brought to bear to "punish" th*
Industries of Battle Creek, and partic
ularly the Postum Company.
This sprung from the refusal of C
W. Post to obey the "orders" of the
unions to take the Postum advertising
away from various papers that refuse
to purchase labor of the tabor trust â
the unions.
Mr. Post was ordered to Join the un
ions in their conspiracy to "ruin" and
"put out of business" these publishers
who had worked faithfully for him for
years, and helped build up his busi
ness. They had done no wrong, but
had found it inconvenient and against
their best judgment to buy labor of
the labor trust. It seems a rule of the
unions to conspire to ruin any one who
does not purchase from them upon
their own terms.
An Ink maker or paper maker who
failed to sell ink or paper would have
the same reason to order Post to help
ruin these publishers. So the peddler
In the street might stone you If you
refused to buy his apples; the cabman
run over you If you refused to ride
with him; the grocer order the man
ufacturer to discharge certain people
because they did not patronize him,
and so on to the ridiculous and villain
ous limit of all this boycott nonsense,
In trying to force people to buy what
they do not want.
If a man has labor to sell let him sell
It at the best price he can get Just as
he would sell wheat, but he has no
right to even Intimate that he will ob
struct the business or attempt Its ruin
because the owner will not purchase
of him.
The unions have become so tyran
nous and arrogant with their despot-
Ism that a common citizen who has
some time to spare and innocently
thinks he has a right to put a little
paint on his own house finds he must
have that paint taken off and put on
again by "the union" or all sorts of
dire things happen to him, his employ
er is ordered to discharge him, his gro
cer is boycotted if he furnishes him sup
plies, his family followed and Insulted
and his life made more miserable than
that of a black slave before the war.
If he drives a nail to repair his house
or barn the carpenters' "union" hounds
him. He takes a pipe wrench-to stop
a leaking pipe and prevent damage
to his property and the plumbers' "un
ion" does things to him. He cannot
put a little mortar to a loose brick on
his chimney or the bricklayers', plas
terers' or hod carriers" "union" is up
in arms and if he carelessly eats a
loaf of bread that has no "union"
label on it the bakers' "union" proceeds
to make life miserable for him.
So the white slave Is tied hand and
foot unable to lift a hand to better
himself or do the needful things, with
out first obtaining permission from
some haughty. Ignorant and abusive
tyrant of some labor union.
It would all seem rather like a comic
opera, If it did not rob people of their
freedom; that kind of work will not be
permitted long in America.
Some smooth managers have built up
the labor trust in the last few years,
to bring themselves money and power
and, by managing worKmen, have suc
ceeded in making it possible for them
to lay down the law in some cities and
force workmen and citizens to "obey"
implicitly, stripping them, right and
left of their liberties.
They have used boycotting, picket
ing, assaults, dynamiting of property
and murder to enforce their orders and
rule the people. They have gone far
enough to order the President to re
move certain citizens from office be
cause the "unions" weren't pleased.
That means they propose to make the
people of the unions replace the law
of this Government and the union lead
ers dominate even the chief executive.
This is a government of and for the
people and no organization or trust
shall displace it. But the unions try it
every now and then, led by desperate
men as shown in their defiance of law
and support of law breaker*.
The "union" record of assaults, crip
pling of men and even women and
children" destruction of property and
murder of American citizens during
the past two years is perhaps ten
times the volume of crime and abuse
perpetrated by slave owners during
any two years previous to the civil
war. We are In a horrible period of
lethargy, which permits us to stand

idly by while our American citizen*
are abused, crippled and murdered in
dozen* and hundreds by an organiza
tion or trust, having for it* purpose
thrusting what It has so sell (labor)
upon us whether or no.
Suppose an American in a foreign
city should be chased by a mob, caught
and beaten unconscious, then his
mouth pried open and carbolic acid
Eoured down his throat, then his ribs
icked In and his face well stamped
with iron nailed shoes, murdered be
cause he tried to earn bread for his
children. By the Eternal, sir, a fleet
of American men of war would as
semble there, clear for action and blow
something off the face of the earth, if
reparation were not made for the blood
of one of our citizens.
And what answer do we make to the
appeals of the hundreds of widows and
orphans of those Americans murdered
by labor unions? How do we try to
protect the thousands of Intelligent
citizens who, with reason, prefer not
to Join any labor union and be sub
ject to the tyranny of the heavily paid
rulers of the labor trusts?
Upon a firm refusal by Mr. Post to
Join this criminal conspiracy a general
boycott was ordered on Grape-Nuts
and Postum all over the country, which
set the good red blood of our ancestors
in motion, bringing forth the reply
that has now passed into history: "We
refuse to Join any conspiracy of or
ganized labor to ruin publishers, nor
will we discharge any of our trusted
employes upon the orders of any labor
union. If they can make their boy
cott effective and sink our ship, we will
go down with the captain on the bridge
and in command."
This set the writers in labor papers
crazy and they redoubled their abuse.
Finally one of their official organs
came out with a large double column
denunciation of Battle Creek, calling
it "a running sore on the face of Mich
igan," because It would not become
"organized", and pay In dues to their
labor leaders. The usual coarse, vil
lainous epithets common to labor un
ion writers were indulged In.
The result was to weld public senti
ment in Battle Creek for protection. A
citizens' association was started and
mass meetings held. Good citizens who
happened to be members of local un
ions, in some cases quit the unions
entirely, for there is small need for
them there.
The working people of Battle Creek
are of the highest order of American
mechanics. The majority are not union
members, for practically all of the
manufacturers have for years declined
to employ union men because of dis
turbances about eleven years ago, and
the union men now In the city are
nmong the best citizens.
No city in the State of Michigan pays
as high average wages as Battle Creek,
no city of its size is as prosperous,
and no city has so large a proportion
of the best grade of mechanics who
own their own homes.
So the workpeople massed together
with the other citizens in the organi
zation of the Citizens' Association with
the following preamble and constitu
tion:
Whereas from 1891 to 1894 the strikes
instigated by labor unions In Battle
Creek resulted In the destruction of
property and loss of large sums of,
money in wages that would have been
expended here; and,
Whereas, these acts caused serious
damage to the city and In a marked
way delayed its progress at that time;
and.
Whereas, since the year 1894 the
citizens have been enabled, by public
sentiment, to prevent the recurrence
of strikes and labor union disturb
ances which have been prevalent else
where; and,
Whereas, the employers oC this city
have steadfastly refused to place the
management of their business under
the control of the labor unions, but
have maintained the highest standard
of wages paid under like conditions
anywhere in the United States, and
hereby unanimously declared their in
tent to continue such policy; and the
employes of this city, a large percent
age of whom own homes and have
families reared and educated under
conditions of peace and the well-earned
prosperity of steady employment, have
steadfastly maintained their right as
free American citizens to work with
out the dictation and tyranny of labor
union leaders, the bitter experience of
the past offering sufficient reason for
a determined stand for freedom; and.
Whereas, the attitude of the citizens
on this subject has been the means of
preserving peaceful conditions and con
tinuous prosperity In marked contrast
to the conditions existing in other
cities suffering from the dictation of
trades unionism; it is therefore
Resolved, that the continuance of
peace and prosperity in Battle Creek
can be maintained, and the destructive
work of outside interference avoided un
der the combined effort and action of

SeventhâTo so amalgamate the
public sentiment of all of the best citi
zens of Battle Creek that a guarantee
can be given to the world of a con
tinuance of peaceful conditions, and
that under such guarantee hnd protec
tion manufacturers and capitalists can
be induced to locate their business en*
terprlse* In Battle Creek.
Then follow articles relating to
membership, officers, duties, etc, etc.
This constitution has been signed by
the great majority of representative
citizens, Including our workpeople.
A number of manufacturers from
other cities, where they have been suf
fering all sorts of indignities, incon
venience and losses from the general
hell of labor union strikes, picketing,
assaults and other Interference, pro
posed to move, providing they could
be guaranteed protection.
The subject grew In importance un
til it has reached a place where abso
lute protection can be guaranteed by
the citizens of Battle Creek on the fol
lowing broad and evenly balanced
terms which guarantee to the work
man and to the manufacturer fairness,
Justice, steady work and regularity of
output.
The new-coming manufacturer agrees
to maintain the standard rate of wage
paid elsewhere for like service, under
Bimilar conditions, the rate to be de
termined from time to time from well
authenticated reports from competing
cities. The tabulated wage reports is
sued by the Government Department of
Commerce and Labor can also be used
to show the standard rate, and It is
expected later on that this government
bureau will furnish weekly reports of
the labor market from different cen
ters, so that the workman when he is
ready to sell his labor and the employ
er when he 1* ready to buy may each
have reliable Information a* to the
market or ruling price.
The new-coming manufacturer also
agrees to maintain the sanitary and
hygienic conditions provided for by the
State laws and to refrain from any
lockouts to reduce wages below the
standard; reserving to himself the
right to discharge any employe for
cause.
The Citizens' Association on its part
agrees to furnish, in such numbers as
it is possible to obtain, first-class work
men who will contract to sell their
labor at the standard price for such
period as may be fixed upon, agreeing
not to strike, picket, assault other work
men, destroy property or do any of the
criminal acts common to labor union
ism, each workman reserving to him
self the right to quit work for cause,
and the Citizens' Association further
pledges Its members to use its asso
ciated Dower to enforce the contracts
between employer and employe and
to act en masse to uphold the law at
all times.
The new Industries locating in Bat
tle Creek will not start under any sort
of labor union domination whatsoever,
but will make individual contracts
with each employe, those contracts be
ing fair and equitable and guaranteed
on both sides.
Thus from the abuses of labor unions
and their Insane efforts to ruin every
one who does not "obey" has evolved
this plan which replaces the old con
ditions of injustice, lockouts, strikes,
violence, loss of money and property,
and general industrial warfare; and
Inaugurates an era of perfect balance
and fairness between employer and
employe, a steady continuance of in
dustry and consequent prosperity; the
entire community pledged by public

Identification.
The public should remember that
there are a few labor unions conducted
on peaceful lines and in proportion aa
they are worthy they have won es
teem, for we, as a people, are strong
ly In sympathy with any right act
that has for its purpose better condi
tions for wage workers. But we do
not forget that we seek the good of
all and not those alone who belong to
some organization, whereas even the
law-abiding unions show undeniable
evidences of tyranny and oppression
when they are strong enough, while
many of the unions harbor and en
courage criminals in their efforts to
force a yoke of slavery upon the Amer
ican people. As a public speaker lately
said: "The arrogance of the English
King that roused the fiery eloquence
of Otis, that inspired the immortal dec
laration of Jefferson, that left Warren
dying on the slopes of Bunker Hill
was not more outrageous than the con
ditions that a closed chop would force
upon the community. These men burst
Into rebellion 'when the king did
but touch their pockets.' Imagine if
you can their indignant protest had
he sought to prohibit or restrict their
occupation or determine the conditions
under which they should earn their
livelihood," and to assault, beat and
murder them, blow up their houses and
poison their food If they did not sub
mit.
The public should also remember that
good true American citizens can be
found in the unions and that they de
precate the criminal acts of their fel
low members, but they are often In baa
company.
Salt only hurts sore spots. So, the
honest, law-abiding union man is not
hurt when the criminals are denounced,
but when you hear a union man "hol
ler" because the facts are made pub
lic, he has branded himself aa either
one of the law breakers or a sym
pathizer, and therefore with the mind
of the l&to breaker, and likely to be
come one when opportunity offers.
That is one reason employers decline
to hire such men.
A short time ago inquiry came from
the union forces to know if Mr. Post
would "keep still" If they would call,
off the boycott on Postum and Grape-
Nuts.
This Is the replyi "The labor trust
has seen fit to try to ruin our business
because we would not Join its criminal
conspiracy. We are plain American
citizens and differ from the labor un
ion plan in that we do not force peo
ple to strike, picket, boycott, assault,
blow up property or commit murder,
"We do not pay thugs $20 to break
in the ribs of any man who tries to
support his family nor $30 for an eye
knocked' out.
"We try to show our plain, honest re
gard for sturdy and Independent work
men by paving the highest wages in
the State.
"We have a steady, unvarying respect
for the law-abiding, peaceable union
man and a most earnest desire to see
him gain power enough to purge the
unions of their criminal practices that
have brought down upon them the
righteous denunciation of a long-suf
fering and outraged public, but we will
not fawn, truckle, bend the knee, wear
the hated collar of white slavery, the
union label, nor prostitute our Ameri
can citizenship under 'orders' of any
labor trust.
"You offer to remove the restriction
on our business and with 'union' gold!
choke the throat and still the voice
raised in stern denunciation of the
despotism which tramples beneath an
iron shod heel the freedom of cur
brothers.
"You would gag us with a silver bar
and muffle the appeal to the American
people to harken to the cries for bread
of the little children whose faithful
fathers were beaten to death while
striving; to earn food for them.
"Your boycott may perhaps succeed
in throwing our people out of work
and driving us from business, but you
cannot wrench from us that priceless
jewel our fathers fought for and which
every true son guards with his life.
Therefore, speaking for our workpeo
ple and ourselves, the Infamous offer
is declined."

PORTLAND SECURES ATZ
Manager of Brownies Swaps
Phil Nadeau for Player
, Who Made Good in South
A bis baseball deal was consummated
yesterday when Pete Lohman and
Judge McCreedle heated the wires for
several hours and finally wound up by
swapping stars. When the deal had
been sent through Lohman was pos
sessed of Pitcher Ham Iberg and Mc-
Creedle had Schlafley safely under his
Wing.
Pete has been trying to do something
with Schlafley for many weeks past,
but could not make a satisfactory deal.
Larry was one of the best second base
men In the league last year and Loh
man wanted him for another season,
but Schlafley vowed he would not play
ball with the Commuters. Since learn
ing of his second baseman's decision
Uncle Peter has been looking around
tor a likely man for whom he could
swap the infielder.
The fans will be surprised to see Ham,
iberg in an Oakland uniform. Ham,
was not altogether satisfied with his
berth on the Portland team last year
and he will gladly welcome the change.
Pete and Ham were always the best
of friends and there is no reason why
the slow-ball pitcher will not make
good with the Commuters.
Just before closing the Schlafley-
Iberg deal McCreedle managed to trade
off another of his stars. After a deal
of'dickering with the management of
the New Orleans team McCreedle
. Anally secured Atz, the star shortstop,
for Phil Nadeau. Just what the finan
cial arrangement was could not be
learned, but it is understood McCreedie
had to give a little piece of side money
before he landed the Southerner.
Nadeau did not play his game at all
while with the Brownies last season
and McCreedie did not want to take
another chance with the hard-hitting
little Frenchman if he could possibly
avoid It. The New Orleans team was
in search of a husky outfielder and
when McCreedie heard this he Imme
diately opened negotiations with the
Southern magnates and finally accom
plished his purpose.
Atz led the shortstops of the South
ern League last season, playing a great
fielding game. He also hit the ball
some, finishing with a batting average
of .278. If he can sustain this gait in
Portland he won't experience any
trouble in making good from the jump.

ATHLETE ROSE
IS CRITICIZED
Giant Shot-Putter Will
Not Be Warmly Greeted
Apparently at Stanford
MICHIGAN IS PRAISED
Will Be More Honored in
Defeat Than in Victory
for Its Recent Action
STANFORD UNTVERSITT, Jan. 16.
The Dally Palo Alto, the represen
tative Stanford newspaper, takes a
whack at Ralph Rose, the University
of Michigan athlete who has recently
been barred from further participation
in college athletics. In an editorial
this evening the college editor has the
following to say regarding the fate of
the famous Eastern shot-putter:
It Is good news that Ralph Rose has been
dropped out of college athletics. Men of the
type of Rose may win field days, but they hurt
the spirit of amateur sport and do their uni
versity more harm than good. Roee, a young
Californian of great athletic ability, was "at
tracted" to Michigan in the manner that many
other fine athletes have been drawn to that
institution. He has taken part In many track
meets. He has made world's records for
Michigan. He has been extensively written
up in newspapers and magazines aa an athletic
marvel and as the only physically perfect man.
Rose, an uncultured country 'ad. grew bigger
than his college. The people of the United
Statee have taken notice and they have asked.
What is this young man in college for? A
college man has been compelled to admit that
Rose, to all appearances, is' in college for ath
letics only. The action of the Michigan board
of control will tend not only to check the
growing idea that colleges are subservient to
athletes, but it will in a measure restore the
reepect of collegians themselves for Michigan's
athletics, which have suffered greatly in pres
tige during the past few years because of the
pracUce of drawing star athletes from distant
parts of the country by means which have been
questioned. Miohigan may lose the athletic
championship of the Middle West because of
the elimination of Rose, but she will be more
honored in defeat than in victory.
CONEY ISLAND JOCKEY CLUB
MAY BUILD A NEW TRACK
Site Is Said to Be Near the New Bel
mont Park in Queens
Count)'.
NEW YORK, Jan. 16.âAn appar
ently well founded rumor has been
going the rounds of turf and real es
tate circles during the past few days
that the Coney Island Jockey Club is
to build a new home. The new track,
it is said, will be situated in Queens
County, and.will lie between the towns
of Hollis and Queens, thus being neai>
the new Belmont Park, which will be
thrown open to the public for the first
time this spring.
The Coney Island Jockey Club Is
practically in the same predicament
as the Brooklyn Jockey Club. Slowly
but surely the city's limits are getting
nearer and nearer to the tracks at
Sheepshead Bay andÂ»at Gravesend and
it is only matter of time before streets
must be cut through the tracks.

FLYING TAM O'SHANTER FROM ASCOT PARK
MAKES A SUCCESSFUL DEBUT AT OAKLAND
Outsiders in Betting Capture Majority of the Purses
Modicum Defeats Ink
and Briers in a
Â»Hard Drive.
BY FRED E. MULHOLLAND.
It was upto Isaac Tullettâor Ike,
to be In a hurryâto introduce a strange
mud lark yesterday at Oakland track.
Tarn O'Shanter was the new comer's
name and he figured as one of seven
starters in the fourth selection, a
seven-furlong selling event.
The O'Shanter horse has been rac
ing down in the southland, where the
clocks run faster than the Empire ex
press and the snowbirds die from sun
stroke. In conformation he Is long
and rangry. looking; like a hatrack
standing; on four corkscrews. Ike is
credited with owning; Tarn O'Shan
ter and for all anybody knows, he
may have secured a lease on the other
half-dozen starters in the race. Their
showing left room for such presump
tion.
The tip was a hot one, and at 9 to
5 the visitor from â  down below was
booted In first by three lengths, while
Box Elder and Haven Run came fol
lowing after. The wrong Mr. Wright
had no influence with Suburban Queen.
Jockey Bullman on Follow Me and one
of the assistant starters came together
in a rearend collision at the start,
spoiling that horse's chance. Tarn
O'Shanter was a good thing all right.
TALENT SUFFERS REVERSES.
It was an unpleasant afternoon for
favorites. The first choices were mas
sacred with but one exception, and
the talent received as thorough a dust
ing as if shoved through a carpet
beating renovatory. Fine weather
favored the sport, but the track was
muddy and holding.
My Order carried the colors of his
new owner. Dr. Rowell. in the opening
sprint, and at odds of 10 to 1 was re
turned a winner. Travers got the out
sider away well and he led Mogreg
or and Grenore past the judges with
little in reserve. Fay Templeton, the
favorite, got away ninth and finished
ninth, all of which goes to show that
the filly is endowed with much ten
acity of purpose.
A pipe through the Lick telescope
when the snow flakes weren't flying,
made Hipponax look like the whole
works for the Futurity course run
following. Heavily played at 9 to 5
John Bullman tied up to a hitching
post at the start and that ended it.
Hulford, a 10 to 1 shot, with Longshot
Jakie Jones up, came scampering home
a length in advance of Profitable, the
smart one of the party. It Was too
bad, but could not be helped. Water
spout ran third.
BATTDOR DEFEATS BRENNUS.
Well, Mysterious Charley Bell steered
the next one, that is the next favorite.
It was Brennus, an 8 to 5 chance for
the five furlong dash. It's a short tale
to relate. At the start Bell appeared
oblivious to all surroundings. In the
stretch something aroused him from
his lethargic state, for he landed his
mount second to Batidor, a 12 to 1
shot, ridden by Minder. Georgie Black,
the early pacemaker, took show hon
ors.
Eight horses that never contested
for a derby lined up in the mile and an
eighth selling fixture. Jakie Jones has
resolved never to win on a favorite, so
Theodora L. finished third. Glenarvon, a
well preserved in liniment specimen of
the thoroughbred, also handled by
Minder, won with tolerable ease from
Langford James. The winner received
some strategic backing at 6 and 6 to 1.
There's nothing to it. Travers is a
hard luck rider. He was given the leg
up on Briers again in the concluding
number, and the mare ran third. Prob
ably because the fourth horse got
nothing. Modicum, a strong 4to 1
chance, was permitted to make his own
pace, and trudged In half a length
ahead of Ink, the second choice.
TRACK NOTES.
Starter Holtman gave McÃride a
three days' vacation for breaking
through the barrier with Yellow Kid
in the first race.
Minder piloted two winners.
The stewards of the Pacific Jockey
Club rendered their decision in the
Knapp case yesterday, on an appeal
made by Walter Jennings against the
decision given by Judge Hamilton of
Ascot Park, awarding the services of
Jockey "Big Bill" Knapp to Puerl
Wilkerson. William S. Knapp, father
of the rider, was ruled off the turf for
swearing that he did not sign the con
tract which gave Wilkerson his son's
services. The original contract for
warded by the Jockey Club of New
York, expiring March 26 next, was
produced and is signed by both
Knapp Sr. and Big Bill. The jockey
was ordered to report to Wilkerson.
There is a probability that Walter
Jennings may now purchase the con
tract.
Knebelkamp & Co., it is reported,
refused an offer of $4000 for the con
tract on the services of Jockey Mc-
Bride.

MITCHELL CALLS ATTENTION
TO SLUMP IN COAL TRADE
At Annual Convention He Says Work
Has Been More Irregular Than
For Eight Years.
INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 16.âThe six
teenth annual national convention of
the United Mine Workers of America
was opened to-day by President Mitch
ell in Tomlinson Hall. Nearly six hun
dred delegates were in their seats, rep
resenting every one of the twenty-five
districts. Reports from the districts
show a shortage in work compared
with previous years. In Indiana the
average has been less than three days
in the week. It is said present condi
tions would tend toward further re
duction in wages were there a scale to
be fixed this year.
In the afternoon the first order of
business was the annual report of
President Mitchell, which was given.
"The heavy falling off in membership
for the month of December, 1904," said
Mitchell, "is accounted for by the fact
that from 20,000 to 25,000 members were
on strike and exempted from the pay
ment of dues. The greatest loss sus
tained is in the Eastern bituminous
and anthracite fields. At no time since
1897 has work been so irregular and
the coal trade so demoralized."
In conclusion Mitchell said: "If the
Western Federation of Miners persist
in pursuing its hostile policy we shall
be justified In extending our jurisdic
tion and opening our doors to the
metalliferous miners."
Secretary-Treasurer Wilson's report
showed that at the close of business on
November 30, 1903, there was in the
treasury $1,106,198. The income during
the year was $851,772 and the expendi
tures $1,354,019, leaving a balance on
November 30, 1904. of $603,952. The ex
penditures were $502,246 36 in excess of
the income and of the total expendi
tures $1,067,300 47 went to aid men on
strike.

ASKS PAY FOR DEATH.âMary E. Heavi
side, widow of Robert H. Heavlslde, and her
two children yesterday sued the United Rail
roads for $10,280 damages for the death of
the husband and father on January 12, 1904
They allege that he waa run over by a car
at the intersection of Turk and Hyde streets

DELIVERY WAGON AND CAR COLLIDE.
A wagon belonging to the Morton Special
Delivery ran into the dummy of a Polk
street car last night at Polk street and Austin
avenue. The car and wagon were damaged to
such an extent as to tie the cars up for some
time. Fortunately those who were seated on
the dummy lumped off and escaped injury.
CHURCH NOT IN POLITICS.
Utah Supreme Court Justice Cham
pions the Mormons.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 16.âJudge Wil
liam M. McCarthy of the Supreme
Court of Utah, a witness called for the
defense in the Smoot investigation, to
day declared that there was a tacit un
derstanding In Utah that one Senator
should be a Mormon and one a gentile.
He said the gentiles realized that If the
Mormons should unite they could con
trol and keep gentiles off the ticket,
and therefore gentiles were apprehen
sive until they knew whether they were
to get Mormon support. The Judge
said that It was his opinion that too
much importance was attached to the
church as a political factor, and that
as a matter of fact there was little In
terference.
Judge James A. Miner of Salt Lake,
formerly of the Supreme Court of Utah
was recalled to-day and testified as to
Smoot's good character and his promi
nence politically in 1890, when Judge
Miner went to Utah. Polygamy was
decreasing so rapidly, said the witness,
that he believed Utah would be better
in ten years than any State in the
Union.
William P. O'Meara, a resident of
Salt Lake City since 1890, testified that
the sentiment of young Mormons was
against polygamy, and that many of
them would be willing to have polye
amous offenses punished by the FpH
eral Government. a "
Judge Charles W. Morse of Salt Lake
City, a Judge of the District Court tes
tided in regard to the work of a sneoiai
Grand Jury In 1903, which investigated
the question of polygamous relations

ADVERTISEMENTS.
Wheeling, W. Va., May 28, 1903.
Some years ago while at work, I fell
over a truck and severely irfjured both
of my shins. My blood became poisoned
as a result, and the doctor told me I
would have running sores for life, and
that if they were healed up the result
would be fatal. Under this discouraging
report I left off their treatment and re
sorted to the use of S. S. S. Its effects
were prompt and gratifying. It took
only a short while for the medicine to en
tirely cure up the sores, and I am not
dead as the doctors intimated, nor have
the sores ever broke out again. Some 12
years have elapsed since what I have de
scribed occurred. Having been so signally
benefitted by its use I can heartily recom
mend it as the one great blood purifier.

Chronic sores start often from a pim
ple, scratch, bruise or boil, and while
salves, washes and powders are beneficial,
the unhealthy maher in the blood must
be driven out or the sore will continue
to eat and spread. S. S. S. reaches
these old sores through the blood, re
moves all impurities and poisons, builds
up the entire system and strengthens
the circulation. S. S. S. is a blood
purifier and tonic combined. Contains

In a few minutes notified the L. E. White

SUPREME JUDGE A WITNESS
IN THE MAIN-HAYES CASE
Justice Henslinw Tell--, of Bonus to Be
Given With Sale of Standard
Cement Bonds.
Justice F. W. Henshaw of the Su
preme Court was one of the witnesses
yesterday at the renewed hearing in
Judge Seawell's department of the case
of Charles Main against Thomas R.
Hayes for the reebvery of $45,000 stock
in the Standard Portland Cement Com
pany, said to have been received by
Hayes as a bonus in the purchase of
bends of the corporation for Main.
Judge Henshaw was a director in the
company and said that $500,000 in bends
were issued and they were underwrit
ten by his brother. William G. Hen
shaw, and W. J. Dingee. Twenty
shares of the company's stock were to
have been given with each $1000 bond,
and, so far as he knew, this arrange
ment was carried out, as none of the
10,000 shares given to Henshaw and
Dingee had been returned to the com
pany.
Dingee, called as a witness, said that
he was absent in the East when most
of the bends were sold by Henshaw
and he had no personal knowledge re
garding the transaction with Hayes.
For that reason questions as to the
bonus given with the sale of bonds
were ruled out by the court.
Charles Main, the plaintiff, who is 87
years old, was called, but had o-nly tes
tified to his Business relations with
Hayes and his absolute confidence in
him, when the trial was continued un
til this morning.
JUSTICE IS A WITNESS
IN HIS OWN COURTROOM
Judge Van, Nostrand Called by Com
plainant In Civil Suit and Testi
fies Under Oath.
For the first time in the history of
the Justices' Court in this city, a Jus
tice of the Peace was called as a wit
ness in hi* own courtroom yesterday.
Justice Van Nostrand had the honor
of appearing as a witness in the case
he was hearing and his testimony did
not in the least please the complain
ant, who called him.
The case was that of William John
son against G. Pistolesl to recover
$290 on the release of a bond. Be
fore the case had gone very far, John
son insisted on calling Van Nostrand
as a witness on his behalf, the suit
having been up In that Justice's court
some time ago. The Judge did not
want to go on the stand without being
sworn and he called Justice Lawson
to perform that ceremony.
Van Nostrand proved, a star witness
and when cross-questioned by the rival
attorneys he never wavered. Johnson
was much dissatisfied with the Judge's
testimony, but it was admitted as evi
dence. The case waa continued till
February 6. . .
WIL-ZINBKI JOINT VHUUâ The will of

minous streets be resumed at once. In
the event that the firm refuses to com
ply the Board of Works is requested

Wnere&a. the testimony of many witnesses,
including the manager of said r.rm, showed
that thÂ« Ccmands MN not in accord with the
contract enured into by the Board of Public
Works with sail! Arm. Inasmuch as sJlowaacia
had been insele at the discretion ot the DUpee

Commissioner of Works Aigeltinger
appeared before the Finance Commit
ter to arrive if possible at some agree
ment whereby the repairs to bitumi
nous pavements may be resumed by
F. M. Yorke & Co., who have
discontinued work owing to their de
mands for August and September hav
ing been refused payment. The com
mittee explained that the August bill
had been rejee-ted because it was re
garded as excessive and because un
due allowances had been made for
surfaces recovered with bitumen. Ai
geltinger reiterated his previous dec
laration that the Board of Works was
desirous of improving the deplorable
condition of the streets. Aigeltinger
later decided to serve a peremptory
notice on F. M. Yorke & Co. to resur
face the many chuckholes on "Market
street between Fourth and Sixth
streets.
FATHER GREY EXAMINED
IN ROOM AT ST. JOSEPH'S
Aged Priest's Memory Tested by
Questioning of Lawyers in His
Case Against Brennan.
On account of the age and illness of
Father P. J. Grey the hearing of his
suit against Dr. Thomas F. Brennan
for the recovery of more than $37,000
was shifted yesterday from Judge
Sloss' courtroom to St. Joseph s Home,
where the plaintiff was examined in
his own room. Judge Sloss, Clerk*
Mann, the stenographer, the attor
neys and the defendant were present.
Father Grey, who had just arisen
from his sick bed. underwent the
day's ordeal with an energy that be
lied his years.
The examination was a test of
memory. He said that he was 92
years old and was made a priest dur
ing the last French revolution. He
was nearly blind and unable to read,
he said, or he would have been at
tending to his duties at St. Patrick s
Church, the buHdlng of which had
been under his direction.
To the questions of his attorney, M.
C. Hassett. the venerable plaintiff told
of the circumstances of the with
drawal cf his funds from the Hiber
nia Bank by Brennan. He said Bren
nan had advised him to take the
money out. as the bank "was tattling
to the Bishop," and told him that the
Crocker-Woolworth Bank was a safe
place to put it. He insisted that
Brennan merely acted as his agent in
the transfer.
Asked on cross-examination as to
some of the matters which had slip
ped his memory. Father Grey admit
ted his forgetfulness and said shrewd
ly that he only wanted to get his
money and hoped the Judge could get
it for him, but he was afraid he
"could not break into their iron box."
He remembered, he said, the first time
he had met Brennan. He visited him
on a sick call and found him without
money. He gave him coin and sent
him into the country to recover.

MANY NATIONAL
BODIES COMING
Coast to Have Seventeen
Great Conventions This
Year, So Reports Wright
â¢
STATE OBTAINS NINE
Promotion Committee Has
Advices Regarding the
Interest in California
"Nine national conventions will be
held in California during the present
year and eight national conventions
will be held In Oregon," said Hamilton
Wright, chief of the publicity bureau
of the California Promotion Committee,
who arrived in the city last night after
an extensive trip throughout the East.
Mr. Wright has been traveling as
the special commissioner of the com
mittee and arranged for conventions
which will be held in California this
year.
From all indications," said Mr.
Wright, "the travel to California this
ye-ar will be the biggest ih the history
of the State. My information as to this
is based on three things, iirst of which
is the fact that the executives of the
big railroads told me that their pas
senger agents throughout the country
are receiving a larger number of in
quiries from people who"want to come
to California than ever before. The
second of these is the conventions men
tioned, and the other is the Portland
Exposition and the tourist business
generally, which will
large. Besides the tourist business
there will be a large colonist travel,
and the large railroads are bringing
out more household goods than ever
before." Mr. Wright continued:
James ("hatltcn. chairman of the Trans
continental Passenger Association, in Chicago,
said that lie thought this year would be far
ahead of last year. People are beginning to
have a more substantial and accural* idea of
the State than ever before. Of course th're
are millions who do not know anything at all
about California. On the other hand then
are hundreds who know what has been dsne
in the way of irrigation and who know tVi 3
opnortufiltles for the small farmer in this
State. Tn every one of the cities I visited the
daily newspapers gsve me interviews ranging
from SOO to 1200 words. They seemed to think
it was news matter and the city editors were
811 glad t > publish matter about California.
This was the best sort of advertising for the
State Â«ad has had the result of placing the
committee In correspondence with hundreds of
people, as the newspaper* all said that infor
mation about the State could be had by writ
ing to the committee.
I arranged with seven large magazines in
the Eas.i for the publication of California ar
ticles. One of the large weeklies, with a cir
culation of almost Ooo.oco, will publish a
Pacific roast number giving particular atten
tion to Callfornn. Some of th; magazines ar
ranged to publish a serle* of articles on Cali
fronla and orh rs to publish California num
ber". This will all be done without charge
and It shows how the East is interested In
California

cluded in the morning with the testi
mony of Mrs. Monnier Sr., who
changed some statements made by her
upon previous examination. Mrs. Mon
nier said that she had had time to re
fresh her memory and was able to
vouch for the corrections.
Roche began his argument by saying
that if the proponent lost the suit,
she would still have the $45,000 man
sion and half the vast estate left by
Monnier, whereas, if his client lost, he
would be penniless and the medical
testimony of the trial showed that he
was incapable of steady work.
Roche declared that all the testi
mony introduced showed conclusively
that George Monnier was the Illegiti
mate son of the wine merchant and
that the deceased often admitted it.
Notwithstanding this, he added, the
contestant was entitled to his rights as
the adopted son. * ,
At this point the court ordered an
adjournment until 10 o'clock this
morning, when Roche will continue
his argument.
Boiler-Maker Draws Too Much.
A suit for an accounting was filed
yesterday by R. J. Brady, administra
tor of the estate of Philip B. Brady,
against William J. Brady and the Eu
reka Boiler Works. Philip Brady died
October 1, last. According to the com
plaint, he Invested in 1889, $1000 in a
fourth interest in a boilermakirig busi
ness of which William Brady owned
half and John Traynor a third. Tray
nor withdrew In May of last year
and it Is alleged that William Brady
ha.= received $30,500 more than his
just proportion of the receipts, for
which he refuses to account. The as
sets of the concern are now said to be
worth $182,000 and Philip Brady's In
terest is valued at $45,000.
Seymour Funeral Not Paid For.
Susan C. Seymour, widow of the lats
Simon H. Seymour and special admin
istratrix of his estate, who is contest
ing the will in which he left her only a
small part of his $300,000 worth of prop
erty, has refused to pay the bill of the
undertakers, N. Gray & Co., for "labor
and materials" furnished for his fu
neral.- The fact is recited in the peti
tion of C. S. Wright, assignee of the
firm's claim for $1143, who asks that
the widow be cited to show cause why
the bill should not be paid. The chief
items of the bill are $900 for the casket.
$66 for eleven carriages and $20 for
eight carriers. Judge Kerrigan will
hear the matter next Monday.

SURGERY
X
Capt. Carney. In speaking* of his cure
by Electro-Chemistry, â ays: "I suffered
from a big tumor on the side of my neck. It
was In a dangerous place. I consulted two
surgeons regarding It. Both said an opera
tion was necessary to save my Ufa An opera
tion would have been expensive and owing to
the location of the growth tt would have been
dangerous. I did not like the Idea 9l the
knife any way. I read In the paper about
i the Electro-Chemic treatment. I read that
consultatftkn and examination at the Electro-
Chemlo Institute was free, so before consent
ing to surgical treatment I decided to have a
talk with the Electro-Chemic specialists. That
was a happy day for me, because in a very
short time at a little expense and with no
suffering or pain whatever I have been thor
oughly cured by Electro-Chemistry. No won
der the Electro-Chemic patients are willing to
give these public testimonials as to the cura
tive effects of this wonderful new treatment.
It surely gives me greet pleasure to do so."

AIM TO BETTER
THE CONDITIONS
Initial Meeting of the Cali
fornia Livestock Sani
tary Association Is Held
WANTS A BILL PASSED
a
AVill Ask the Legislature
to Establish the Position
of a County Inspector
The first meeting of the California
Livestock Association was held at the
Palace Hotel yesterday afternoon. The
object of the association is to work
for livestock sanitary interests of the
different counties as well as of the
State at large. Only county, city.
Federal and State veterinarians en
gaged officially in livestock sanitary
work are eligible to membership.
Many attended the first meeting and
were enrolled. Several State veterin
arians who are not officially engaged
were present and showed keen inter
est in the proceedings. Dr. C. L. Me
gowan was appointed president and
Dr. Charles Keane secretary.
After a short opening address by
the secretary Drs. Archibald, Baker
and Sawyer were appointed a com
mittee to draft rules and by-laws for
the association. The committee later
submitted its draft, which was adopt
ed. It was decided to hold an annual
meeting in December. A resolution
was adopted to appoint an executive
committee of five, including the pres
ident and Drs. Baker,
Archibald and Sawyer were appointed
as other members of the committee.
Dr. Keane presented an amendment
to the county government act, which
will be submitted to the Legislature,
giving the Board of Supervisors of a
city or county the power to create an
office of livestock sanitary inspector.
The salary and necessity of this of
flce is to be left to the discretion of
the Supervisors of such county. The
amendment was adopted and it will be
forwarded to Senator Lynch, who will
introduce the bill.
Papers entitled "Glanders" and
"Tuberculosis" were read by Dr. T.
Carpenter and Dr. George Baker re
spectively. These dealt with matters
of interest to the profession and were
thoroughly discussed.
Many of the memÃers were in fa
vor of framing a bill to present to the
Legislaure whereby the State would
compensate any stock raiser or indi
vidual whose animal was destroyed
because of glanders. The association
believed that it was one means by
which the feared disease could be
eradicated.
The following members were pres

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Jan. 16 âTransactions on the
Stock Exchange rose above the million share
mark again to-day and with the Increased
animation there was a considerable showing of
â¢trehgth. The conspicuous movement in Union
Pacific exercised a sympathetic influence on
the whole market. But during the course of
the' day, when the movement la that stock
'showed signs of having run itself out, the
tone of the rest of the market also gave evi
dence of hesitation and difficulty in resisting
the reaction. After its five points rise of last
week and with its advance tÂ«-day through the
figure which had been i>olnted to In the cur
rept speculative gossip as the objective of the
movement. Union Pacific naturally came In
for KHO* heavy speculative profit taking. The
â¢Accumulation of orders over Sunday, which
had been attracted by the buoyant movement
of Friday and Saturday, helped to carry the
Stocks up through the offerings to realize to a
high record for the movement of 120%. An
additional 3 point jump in Northern Securities
ion 'the curb kept up the parallel between the
.two stocks upon which the movement has
'hinged throughout. The sympathetic response
In- Southern Pacific and St. Paul was only
moderate and In the railroad list at large was
even less notable. Among the industrials and
Specialties, however, there were various points
of effective supplementary strength. Amalga
mated Copper was especially active and strong
Under the influence of the near approach of
the ;ierlod when the dividend Is usually acted
upon. United States Steel preferred was ef
fectively bought, although Its advance was
somewhat belaud, and the current gossip re
garding the showing of earnings for the De
cember quarter was more hopeful than last
wnek. The subsidiary steel companies and
railroad equipment companies, as well as the
â¢leotrica! and smelting companies, showed the
general effect of the metal trade conditions.
Tl)p money market was very easy In all de
partments and for call loans was practically
glutted as the result of the heavy Inflow of
oerroncy from the interior tast week. The
day's hwslntss was not only largely congested
In a few prominent stocks, but came from
concent rated sources less than half a dozen
Jarec- heoges being credited with deallnes any
where up to Sft.QDO shares apiece. The pres
sure against .the market gained force, with the
result that the Pacifies and St. Paul closed
at. net losses, while- thÂ» earlier gains were
much reduced throughout. The closing was
easy

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain an-l Provisions.
CHICAGO. Jan. 16.âThe whÂ»Â»Rt market
opened firm, with prices snowing some Im
provement over Saturday's dosing quotations.
May King up %c to %c at ft 10% to 61 17%.
The principal 'eason for the flimness was the
bullish appearance of world's shipments for
last week, the total amount being less than
the estimated consumption of the Importing
countries. In this connection the decreased
movement from Russia and Argentina had
certain influence. Offerings were rather lim
ited and came principally from scalpers. As
the session advanced, however, the selling be
came more pronounced and sentiment In the pit
turned bearish. cause of this change was
gossip received from outside markets telling
of a lessened sale for cash wheat. Commis
sion houses were free sellers during the latter
part of the session. May sold oft to $1 15%
and closed at $1 15%*rl 15%.
Indications of a heavier movement, as mani
fest, d by an Increase in the visible supply, had
a weakening effect on the corn market. May
opened c. shade to %c higher at 44%@45c and
closed at H%c.
Weakness of othor grains caused some selling
of oats, but a decrease In the visible supply
held the declining tendency in check and pre
vented any material loss. May closed %c
lower at 31c.
Influenced by a decline in hog prices, the
provision market was somewhat weak early in
the day. At the close May pork was up sc.
lard was up 2'<jc snd ribs were a shade higher.

advancing steadily, practically all of the
Wheat of the republic is In the hands of mill
ers and stocks are only sufficient to keep the
plants in operation to the end of this month."
In this market several descriptions of cash

In good shape for sellers and everything except
Broilers moved freely at steady* prices. Three
carloads of Western were marketed and cleaned
up well. Receipts of local stock were only

Butter. Cheese and Errs.
All but three or four houses reported Butter
a fraction higher yesterday, with the market
well cleaned up of the best' creameries. Those
who did not quote an advance still had large
stocks to get rid of. A higher Los Angeles
market and inquiries from there, together with
the diversion of the San Joaquin creameries
to Los Angeles and lighter stocks here, were
the prime causes of the advance. There was
no change In Cheese.
Eggs were considerably at sea yesterday.
Few dealers seemed to have any definite idea
as to prices, and the different houses quoted
anywhere from 26c to 30c, according to their
stock*. The quotations below are about as
close as can be given under the confusing cir
cumstances. Receipts were larger than usual
on Mondays, and as stocks were still accumu
lating the tendency to sell and get out from
under became more marked.
Receipts were 33,400 rbs Butter, 659 cases
Eggs and 8000 lbs Cheese.

Six carloads of Apples were received from j
Oregon and Washington, and. as further heary i
shipments are expected from tha, same sources |
within a few days, there is less flrmnes* in
thia department of the market, although trade
k) still active. Prices of Citrus fruits show
considerable revision. Standard Navel Or- j
anges and Mexican Limes are in good request
at steady prices, while choice and fancy Na
ve|s continue to drag. A carload of Tan- ;
gerlnes came in from Butte County and. being
of good* quality, met with a fair demand at

CONVICTED ROBBER AGAIN
PLACED UNDER ARREST
Fred Durkhard, Allowed to Go on His
Own Recognizance, Fails to
Keep His Promise.
Fred Durkhard was arrested yester
day by Detectives Davids and Mc-
Grayan and locked up pending action
by the District Attorney. The police
look upon Durkhard as a dangerous
character.
Durkhard, Fred Lawrence and Fred
Goodman were arrested on April 28
on a charge of robbery. They fol-
Jowed L. Kessler to his room in the
new Franklin Hotel on Pacific street,
beat and robbed him. Lawrence and
Goodman pleaded guilty and were
each sentenced to serve ten years in
San Quentin.
Durkhard pleaded not guilty and
was tried and convicted by a Jury. On
September 13 a motion for a new trial
was denied- On October 5, when he
appeared for sentence, his
promised that he would be sent to sea
in a deepwater vessel, whereupon the
Judge suspended sentence and allowed
him to go on his own recognisance.
The police say Durkhard remained
in the city. Thty are satisfied he has
committed several crimes, but he has
been shrewd enough to cover up his
tracks. Judge Dunne wlf! be asked to
pass sentence at once.
Severe winter weather begins in Si
beria early in October. Ice oftaa re
mains in the rivers until July.

KILLS SALOON MAN
IN A JEALOUS RAGE
William Nyberg Is Murdered
Siaator of Divorced Wife Shoots
Dowm Her Former Hmslbainid.
In a dispute over a divorced woman
William Peterson, a longshoreman,
shot and lnstantlly killed William Ny
berg; a saloon-keeper, yesterday at a
rooming-house. 231 Third street. The
woman over whom the' trouble arose
was formerly the wife of the murdered
man.
â¢. Peterson had threatened the woman
that if she received visits from her
former husband or any other man he
would make trouble. On January 1
he entered Mrs. Nyberg's room flour
ishing a revolver. She had him ar
rested for assault with a deadly weap
on. The charge was reduced to one
of .exhibiting a deadly weapon. After
serving a day's imprisonment Peter
son was discharged Sunday with the
understanding he was to leave town.
â¢ Instead of keeping his word Peterson
went back to the rooming-house
where Mrs. Nyberg lived and attempt
ed tb see her. She called for a police
man and Peterson left muttering
threats. He remained in the house
until yesterday afternoon, when, ac
companied by Oscar Laido, a < sailor.
Nyberg called there. At the head of

the stairway they met Peterson. In
a conciliatory manner Nyberg - sug
gested that they declare their differ
ences off.' Peterson turned on his heel
and walked away without a word.
Thereupon Laido and Nyberg went
into Mrs. Nyberg's room. Laido saw
that Peterson lurked in the hallway
for a while and then disappeared
toward the rear of the building. After
chatting a few moments with the wo
man and Mrs. Nellie Brown, Nyberg
walked down the hallway to a porch
in*the rear.
Here he opened a door and was sur
prised to find Peterson on the other
side of it. Peterson at once drew a
revolver and before Nyberg could ut
ter a word fired twice. Nyberg threw
up his arms and fell over backward,
dead. Both bullets entered Nyberg's
head.
Holding the smoking pistol in his
hand Peterson ran through the hall
way. A. B. Carleton, a carpenter who
had seen the shooting, was running
out of the house to give the alarm.
"Stop." shouted Peterson. "If you
try to report me I'll shoot you, too."
Carleton dodged back out of range
of the pistol and Peterson ran into the
street .and made good his escape.
The troubles of the Nybergs have
been aired In the Police Courts on sev
eral occasions. When Peterson was in
Judge Mogan's court last Friday the
ex-husband of the woman told the
Judge that Peterson had once shot at
him through a transom and had fre
quently threatened to kill him. Judge
Mogan advised the saloon-keeper to
swear out a warrant for the man's ar
rest. But Nyberg declined to take the.
advice, saying that he would get a pis
tol and take care of himself. When
Mrs. Nyberg appeared in court to pros
ecute Peterson she received a severe
talking to from Judge Mogan regard
ing her notions of morality. When
seen shortly after the shooting yester
day the woman denied that she had en
couraged the attentions of Peterson.
She became hysterical when she learn
ed that her former husband had been
killed. The woman at the bottom of
the sordid Zolaesque tragedy is in no
way attractive.
Had not Peterson's aim been true A.
B. Carleton. the only witness of the
murder, might have been hit by one of
the bullets. He was working on the
porch w here the tragedy occurred, and*
directly in range of Peterson's revolver.
According to him. Peterson came out
on the porch in an angry mood and,
going into a toilet room, slammed the
door. Shortly afterward Nyberg came
out and c-pened the door. At once came
the two shots.
Detectives Cody and Fitzgerald are
searching for the murderer, but up to
a late hour last night had found no
trace of him. Peterson is about 27
years old, five feet six Inches in height
and has a sandy mustache.

SHOW HOUSES

ORDINANCE
Three of the Ten-Cent Places
Are Closed by the Board of
Public Works at the Insti
gation of the Grand Jurors
FLAGRANTLY LACKING
IN FIRE PROTECTION
Attention of Commissioners
Is Called to Neglect to
Observe Law and Drastic
Steps Are at Once Taken
The activities of Foreman T. P. An
drews, E. J. Bowes and W. G. Staf
ford of the Grand Jury were shifted
yesterday from investigation of police
protection in Chinatown to fire protec
tion in the 10-cent showhouses. Com
missioners Aigeltinger, Maestretti and
Egan of the Board of Public Works
were invited to Join in the Inspection,
and the- three theaters visited during
the afternoon âthe Baldwin, the Nov
elty and the Uniqueâwere unanimous
ly condemned as far from complying
with the ordinances calculated to In
sure safety to the patrons. At the con
clusion of the performances last night
they were ordered closed by Chief
Wittman, by direction of the Board of
Public Works.
The jurors demanded that the show
houses be shut down yesterday after
noon after their visit, but the Com
missioners refused to take action until
they had deliberated and consulted
counsel. Every Commissioner ex
pressed himself as convinced, how
ever, that there was flagrant viola
tion of the regulations in each In
stance.
Notice was also served on the Cineo
graph on Market street last night by
the Commissioners, Independently of
Grand Jury suggestion. The house
had been closed for several days, how
ever. The other show-places are to be
visited by the grand jurors and the
Commissioners on Wednesday after
noon. It Is believed that there are
some of them that must go out of busi
ness urjtll the ordinances are complied
with.
UP TO WITTMAN.
Commissioners Aigelttnger and Egan,
who have just been appointed to
the board, explained that they had not
yet had time to look into the theater
conditions and what they saw was a
revelation to them. Maestretti said he
had not known of the violations of the
regulations, no reports having come to
him from the inspectors. There was
no dissenting voice among them as to
the rigorous course that should be
pursued.
It developed that the Novelty and
Upique theaters have been running for
several months, notwithstanding the
Board of Public Works refused to issue
permits to them because they had not
fulfilled the requirements of the ordi
nance.
"Why were they allowed to con
tinue?" was asked.
"That question is up to Chief Witt
man of the Police Department," an
swered Maestretti. "The board is not
supposed to do police duty. We dis
approved of these two showhouses and
denied them permits and that is all

MOET Â®> CHANDON
"White Seal" Champagne
According to Custom House statistics
compiled by the acknowledged authori
ties, S. G. Allaire & Son, 3 S. William St.,
New York, and Bonfort's Wine and Spirit
Circular, New York, the importations of
Moet & Chandon Champagne for the
year 1904 into the United States were
127,783 Cases
exceeding all other brands and breaking
all records.
WILLIAM WOLFF & CO., - - San Francisco,
PACIFIC COAST AGENTS FOR
Moet & Chandon" WHITE SEAL" and BRUT IMPERIAL Champagnes
our department had to do with the
matter."
The Grand Jury has had a detective
at work for several days examining
the Interiors of the three showhouses.
He made a report, and yesterday af
ternoon subpenas were quietly issued
on the members of the Board of Pub
lic Works. It was decided at once to
set out on the tour of inspection. The
first place visited was the Baldwin on
Market street. This showhouse has
been a favorite subject fqr Grand Jury
investigation. The former Inquisitorial
body was led to make inquiry as to
how Abe Ruef came to purchase his
interest in it.
MANY DEFECTS FOUND.
The faults found with it yesterday
were that there was a lodging-house
overhead; that the partitions in the
dressing-rooms are of wood; that the
walls of the proscenium arch are
built of wood; that the girders sup
porting the stage are of wood; that
there are no ventilators over the stage;
that there are no Iron grooves for
the asbestos curtain to slide in; that
there are no courts on each side of
the building to the street, with exits
to them from the auditorium and the
stage; that in the auditorium there
are more than six seats in a row be
tween the aisles, there being as many
as nine in some rows; that the seats
are only twenty-eight inches from
back to back* whereas they should be
thirty-two Inches apart; . that the two
stairways leading to the gallery are of
wood; that the gallery is not con
structed of fire-proof material; that
the ceiling Is not of fire-proof material,
and that the basement is used for
storage purposes.
In al! these instances, it was demon
strated, the ordinance was not com
plied with.
The Novelty Theater on Powell street j
had only one ventilator over the stage, i
the ordinance requiring two; the stair
ways were constructed of wood;, the
well of the proscenium arch was not
of brick; in the dressing-rooms and
other construction where fireproof ma
terials are required there was only a
covering of zinc.
AN ARCH OF PAPER.
At the Unique the proscenium arch I
was a false construction of paper; there
were no stage ventilators to draw
flames away from the audience. In
stead of fireproof construction about
the place there were only coverings of
asbestos paper and zinc. There were
large, ample exits, several water bar
rels about and plenty of hose In place.
The proprietors explained that at a
heavy expense over a year ago they
had fitted the place up to comply with
the demands of 'the Board of Public
works and its inspectors? But the
Jurors and the present Commissioners ;
declared that the ordinance was on the i
books to be obeyed and that there could
be no such thing as making a theater I
what would be reasonably regarded
safe in the opinion of the Board of
Public Works.
The showhouses closed last night
were as If struck by a oolt from the
blue sky. They complain that the reg
ulations made for theaters wlt,h a
capacity for l&OO or 2000 auditors are
not reasonably applied to the small
places where there are no larger audi
ences than 500 persons. They declare
that If the regulation against having
a lodging-house in the same building
were enforced stringently the Califor
nia would be compelled to shut its
doors because the hotel Is In the same
building and that the Columbia would
have to do likewise, for the floors above
It are devoted to a lodging-house.
New York Capitalist Very Ill.

ness man of New York City, who was j
recently removed from the Palace Ho- ,

MATADOR FROM
MADRID JAILED
Enrico Robles Arrested on
a Warrant From Paso Ro
bles, but Later Released
4
Enrico Robles, who says he is the
champion bullfighter of Madrid, Spain,
occupied a cell at the City Prison yes
terday waiting the arrival of Constable
R. W. Gavno from Paso Robles, San
Luis Obispo County, where he is want
ed on a charge of obtaining property by
false pretenses. It was while giving an
exhibition of bullfighting at Paso Ro
bles in October, 1903, that the alleged
crime was committed.
After leaving Paso Robles the bull
fighter came here and advertised that
he would give an exhibition at Point
Richmond. It proved a fiasco, as the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals interfered.
Robles was not heard of again till
the night of January 6, when, prior to
the wrestling match between Jenkins
and Carkeek at Woodward's Pavilion,
he stepped upon the platform and was
Introduced by "Billy" Jordan as "the
champion bullfighter from Madrid."
This led to his arrest.
Constable Gayno read in the papers
of Robles' introduction to the audience
at the Pavilion. He then wrote to Chief
Wlttman that he held a warrant for
Robles' arrest on a charge of obtain
ing property by false pretenses. Yes
terday afternoon Policeman Harry
Hook picked him up on O'Farrell
street.
Robles says he does not know why
he was arrested. He lived at a hotel at
Paso Robles for a week and paid his
bill, $15 or $20, he forgets which* He
understands it is alleged that he gave
a check which was worthless, but he
declares he never gave a check to any
'one. He is afraid his arrest will spoil
his proposed exhibition here, advertised
to take place in a few days.
Morris Levy, his manager, called at
the Hall of Justice and got Police
Judge Fritz to release Robles on $25
cash bail pending the arrival of the
constable from Paso Robles.
Sailors' Protective Society.
As a result of a controversy over rep
resentation on the board of an existing

Loan Sues for Broken Ribs.
Albert H. Lean, masseur and physi-
I cal culture director ,at the Olympic
I Club, yesterday filed a suit, for $6000
damages against the 'Standard Elec
trical Construction Company. On Jan
. vary 17, 1903, the company was en-
I gaged in installing an elevator In the
j club building. In prosecuting the
I work a trap door in one of the passages
! was left open. Lean had no warning
j and walked into the hole. His fail re
i suited in a couple of broken ribs and
I other injuries for which he demands
pay ' . Â» .
SATS WOMAN ROBBED HIM.âE. D. Oli
ver, a guest at the Russ House, reported to
the police yesterday that a woman stole from
his pocket four silver certificates of the value
of $10 each. He said he met the woman
early yenterday morning on Montgomery
street end after they had visited several
places unknown to him she left him. A few

HALL FOLLOWS
HIS FATHER
Son of a Supposed Victim
. of San Rafael Sinking
Disappears Mysteriously
Robert Hall, twenty years old, sane
snd sober, came to San Francisco on
December 16 with seventy dollars in
his pocket, some of which he was to
Fay H. V. Morehouse for legal serv
ices on behalf of his mother. Then he
was to take the boat for San Rafael
to visit an uncle, Patrick Cassidy. He
never went to the lawyer's offlce, and
Uncle Cassidy waited in vain. From
that day to this there have been no
tidings of Robert Hall. A letter
which had been mailed'by him at the
ferry building on December 16 was re
ceived by his mother, Mrs. Catherine
P.. Hall, at Sacramento. That was the
last clew he left as to his whereabouts!
The disappearance of this young
man is doubly interesting, because i-i
1901 his father. Alexander Hall, drop
ped from sight very much in the same
manner. He left his home in Sacra
mento to visit the same uncle, Patrk k
Cassidy, in San Rafael. He also
mailed at the ferry depot a letter to
his wife. It is presumed that he took
passage on the ferry boat San Refuel
for the train on which lie had left
Sacramento arrived at the ferry build
ing In time to allow him to take that
boat. Or. that trip the ferry steamer
Sausalito collided with and sank the
San Refael. No one who knew Hall
happened to be on the boat; no one on
the dock saw him go aboard, for he
was a stranger in this city. No body
identifled as his was ever found, yet
Judge de Haven a few weeks ago
awarded the widow and the minor
childen damages for his death, believ
ing the circumstances sufficient proof
that he was a victim of the collision.
There is a strange coincidence be
tween the fading away of the son and
of the father. Mr. Cassidy visited the
police and the Coroner yesterday and
told the story of the young man's dis
appearance.
