"The probability of war is decreasing.

landing of Japanese troops at a Korean
port with the object of maintaining
peace." . ;
"There is no doubt that the Russian
reply intimates in a friendly way that
Russia cannot-accept Japanese inter
ference. ' At a council concerning Man
churia it was stated that Japan was
placing immense difficulties in the way
of a peaceful solution, rendering it im
possible for Russia to recede from her

not allow Japan to acquire territory in
Southern Korea, thus cutting Commun

REPLY TO GENERAIi
REYES IS NOW READY
It is now the purpose of the depart
ment to cable to the admiral a special
set of instructions to meet the present
conditions in the Far East, and those
instructions will be delivered to him at
Guam, according to the present pro
gramme. It is said at the department
they will show no discrimination what
ever between the parties as to any pos
sible hostilities, but the admiral will
be expected to so dispose of his force
as to maintain the appearance of strict
neutrality as between the belligerents.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6.â Naval of
ficials are somewhat embarrassed as to
the best disposition to be made of
United States warships on the Asiatic
station in view of the imminence of
war between Russia and Japan. The
policy of the administration is to ob
serve the strictest neutrality and keep
hands off, except in the single con
tingency of Infringement upon Ameri
can "treaty rights. â¢
When Admiral Evans' fleet was or
dered ba<ck to its station from Honolulu
It was arranged that the cruiser squad
ron should stop at Midway Island,
where there is a cable station, 'to re
ceive any instructions the department
might desire to send. T-hese instruc
tions were simply for Admiral Evans*
fleet to await instructions at Guam.
That dispatch was delivered to the
cruiser squadron, which touched at
Midway on the 3d Instant and left the
same day for Guam, the rendezvous of
the entire sauadron fleet.
It Is expected that Admiral Evans
will reach Guam* in a few days and re
port his arrival to the department.
Inquiry at the navigation bureau de
velops the fact that up to this mo
ment the admiral has received no spe
cial instructions for his guidance In
the event of hostilities in the Far East.

"In making the third proposition
Japan wished not only to protect her
rights In China and those of Russia in
Korea, but to consecrate by the princi
ple.of equality the commercial rights of
all nations In Korea and China.
"Russia declined the Japanese propo
sitions and submitted a counter propo
sition which contained a clause provid
ing for the creation of a neutral zone
extending from the China-Korean fron
tier to. Wongtan<>n the east and to
Pingyang on the west. The zone com
prised almost a .third of Korea.
"This Russian pretension took from
Japan all guarantee of the protection of
her rights in Manchuria and sequestra
ted a considerable part of Korea where,
without contradiction, Japan's interests
preponderate and which every nation
recognizes as being within the legiti
mate sphere of Japan.
"The proposal exasperated Japanese
public opinion. Japan could not ac
cept the proposal for these reasons:
"1â The definitive occupation by Rus
sia of Manchuria would be a perma
nent menace to the independence of
Korea, which Japan must prevent at
any price, for Korea is an advance post
of Japan's line of defense and the safe
ty of Korea is a condition sine qua non
of her own security.
"2 â Japan has, as other powers,
rights and immunities in Manchuria by
virtue of treaties with China. These
rights- and, immunities cannot be left
to the jnercy of Russia. The refusal of
Russia to examine the Manchuria
question denoted on her part the Inten
tion not to observe the rights of all
nations In that region. Most evident
among other proofs of this intention on
the part of Russia were the occupation
of Yang Tung Tcheng and the reoccu
patlon of Moukden. Every one knows
that by. the new treaties concluded by
the United States and Japan with
China one city and two ports were to
be opened to the commerce of the
world. Yang Tung Tcheng and Mouk
den* were the two points chosen. By
the occupation of these ports Russia
prevented China fulfilling the obliga
tions of her treaties.
"In Korea, equally, acts of Russia
have had, as a result, the closing of
the Yalu River to foreign commerce.
Japan asked Korea, simultaneously
with the United States and Great Brit
ain, to-open thlsi region to international
commerce. In occupying Tongwang
pow (Yongampho). the only port in
North Korea, Russia paralyzed the
realization of this project. Japan then
had reason to. fear that letting Russia
alone would result in closing the Yeli
low^Sea and the interior of Manchuria
to international commerce. : â¢
"In struggling with all her force
against the pretensions of Russia In
the Far East, Japan works not only for
herself, but for all nations. Japan does
not Ignore the dangers and risks of an
armed conflict with Russia, and does
not embark upon it with a light heart."
of Seoul. Through the kindly offices of
the American, Minister, General Foote,
a peaceful adjustment of difficulties
was brought about. The Japanese sur
vivors of the massacre were es
corted to Chemulpo. The Chinese army
of 3000 men and the Japanese force of
5000 were withdrawn from Korea.
Japan regards the Russian pressure
toward Korea as a menace and will re-
Blst the advance on the battlefield. For
many years there existed a neutral
zone between the heavily timbered re
gion of Northern Korea and Manchu
ria. It is reuorted that the Russians
/recently sought leases of neutral ter
ritory and are now in possession of. the
country. It is well understood that
Russia is j|low to relinquish any ad
vantages gained by diplomacy or war.
General Foote entertains a high opin
ion of the fighting quality of the Jap
anese army and is not at all convinced
that Japan would come 'out second best
in. a clash on land. It is the judgment
of military men generally that Russia
will be able to hold the, territory that
she now occupies.' vX '- ' >c '

BRITAIN MAY AID JAPAN.
Cannot Permit the Little Empire to
Be Crushed by Russia.
, LONDON, Jan. 7.â There are two in
dications, this morning that nothing
definite has developed In the Far East
ern crisis and that nothing is likely to
develop until the end of the week. The
first of these- indications, according to
ttier Tokio" correspondent; of the Daily
fTelVgraph, is triat an urgency meeting
of the' Japanese Cabinet has been called
for to-day, and the second is that the
members of ; the British Cabinet have
been notified to assemble, on Monday.
The meeting of the Japanese Cabinet
has almost certainly been called for
the purpose of considering the reply of
Russia to the last Japanese note; and
it is equally certain the meeting of the
British Cabinet will be for the purpose
of discussing the attitude of Great
Britain In the light of the Russian re
ply. This question is beginning to be
most anxiously discussed by the Brit
ish press. . 'â¢â¢ .
Editorials in this morning's papers
are almost unanimous in admitting
that, even if the war should be con
fined to Russia and Japan, Great Brit
ain cannot possibly see Japan crushed,
and that, although not called upon to
interfere by the terms of the; Anglo-
Japanese treaty, and while hostilities
may be confined to the .two nations,
yet;in the event of Japan suffering, a
great naval defeat Great 'Britain would
be, almost compelled to go to her as
sistance. ' .
: "Thus," as the Dally Telegraph ob
serves, "the Cabinet will be called upon
to discuss not only the nature of the
obligations arising out of the Anglo-
Japanese alliance, but also the limits
pf British neutrality in the event of a
Russo-Japanese war." '
Some of the papers, apparently doubt
ing:.- from the record of the present
Government, urge that a plain Indica
tion of Great Britain's intentions would
be-most effective In avoiding war. The
Morning Post asks:
\ "What has the Government done by
way .of preparation for a war on a
sreat scale in 1904?"
The Daily Mail wants Russia notified
that "under no. circumstances will
Great Britain permit the Russian Black
Sea fleet to .pass the Dardanelles," and
urges the Admiralty "to see that the
navy is quite ready for emergency."
- The Standard's Tokio correspondent
says that the Russian warships which
until" recently were In Korean waters
are returning hastily to Port Arthur.
He adds that the fall in stocks con
tinues unchecked.
â¢The Chefu correspondent of the
Morning Post cables that orders have
been issued to the officials of the' Si
berian Railroad that freight trains

A strong squadron is moored in Â¦ the
harbor, of Port Arthur.
lu Event of War First Combat Will
Be Fought Near Seoul.
KOREA THE BATTLEGROUND.
In the event of war between Russia
and Japan the contending armies would
probably fight the ' first battle some
where near Seoul, the capital of Korea.
The seaport nearest Seoul is Chemulpo,
distant twenty-seven miles. An electric
railway, built in American style, con
nects the seaport with the capital.
There is a strong. Impression in army
and navy circles of San Francisco that
the United States Government is pre
paring the army transports with a view
of sending American troops to China
or Korea. There is said to be serious
apprehension of revolt and trouble in
China. It is feared that fighting on
Korean soil between the Russians and
Japanese would be the signal for an
other uprising in China.
Telegrams from Washington mention
the- preparation" to land United States
marines at Chemulpo as an incident of
affairs in the Orient, b\it in France and
England great, significance 13 attached
to the movement. Seoul, the capital of
Korea, was the scene of a bloody revo
lution in 1881. Many Japanese were
slain by Koreans and many more would
have been massacred If protection had
not been afforded to them at the Amer
ican legation .in Seoul. General Lucius
H. Foote of this city was then Minister
Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordi
nary from the United States to the
kingdom of Korea. His courageous and
kindly services in behalf or the Japan
ese were so highly valued by the Em
peror of Japan that the latter sent a
letter of thanks to our Government.
The letter was transmitted to the Sen
ate by the Secretary of State.
Speaking of the American legation at
Seoul, General FOote last evening re
marked that it embraced five acres of
land inclosed by a cement wall. The
residence of the Emperor of Korea is
near by, and the British and Russian
legations are adjacent. A large and
substantial brick dwelling and three
small houses are within the American
lines.
General Foote believes that a force
of 100 marines within the legation walls
would, if properly equipped with rapid
fire guns, be sufficient to afford pro
tection to the Minister and attaches. In
Korea foreigners are hated. There is
a traditional prejudice against the for
eigner of the Japanese type which does
not apply to Americans, British and
Russians. Legends of Korea represent
Japan as the ancient enemy and tradi
tional oppressor. In the outbreak of
18S1 the wrath of the populace against
the Japanese could- not be restrained,
hence many Japs were ruthlessly
butchered in the streets o-f S-Loul. In
the event of war and the massing; of
armed Russians and Japanese on Ko
rean territory the natives o. the coun
try might not extend sympathy or aid
to. either. It is probable that the ap
pearance of the Russians on the war
path would excite curiosity. The sight
of the Japanese would surely provoke
demonstrations of hostility. It is the
policy of Japan to civilize the Orient
and to preserve the autonomy of Ori
ental nations against the slow and
fateful advance of Russia. The pur
pose of the- Japanese is beyond the
comprehension of both the Korean and
the Chinaman. Â¦ ' "Â¦* . ' Â¦ â¢Â¦â¢

NEGOTIATIONS TO CONTINUE.
Tokio Official. Explains Status of the
,, ... , Far Eastern Question.
TOKIO, Jan. 6.â It- is believed here
that the Russian response has been
handed to the Government, but the
secret of Its delivery has been jealously
guarded and the nature of the reply
remains undisclosed. Minister of For
eign Affairs Komura called this after
noon upon Baron de Rosen, the Rus
sian Minister to Japan, with whom he
remained an hour. Later he visited
Premier Katsura and an extended con
ference was held.
There is every indication now that
further negotiations will take place, al
though it Js expected that Japan will
refuse to fransfer the discussion of af
fairs to St. Petersburg if this be pro
posed. â¢ Â¦ . .
Governor Taft of the Philippine Isl
ands and his wife was to-day granted
an audience by the Emperor and Em
press, taking luncheon with them later.
Subsequently an informal discussion
took place, the Emperor expressing his
satisfaction at- the friendly relations
which existed between America- and
Japan, which he hoped would continue.
He wished the Americana to under
stand that Japan was striving earnestly
and patiently to maintain peace.
A high Japanese authority to-day
made the following-explanation of the
status of the Far Eastern question:
"The statement that Russia has made
concessions to Japan is not exact. On
the contrary Russia, in the month of
October, made certain concessions
which were accepted by Japan, but sub
sequently withdrew them and assumed
an attitude which left the Japanese
little hope in the way of reaching a
satisfactory agreement. The Japanese
Government, -confident in the "declara
tions of disinterestedness In Manchuria
made by Russia and recognizing Rus
sia's special interests in that region,
wished to regulate, once "for all, all
questions in the Far East in the(inter
est of future peace and tranquillity.
To this end Japan made the following
proposals:
"1â Russia and Japan should mu
tually respect â¢ the independence and
territorial integrity of China and
Korea. - . . " v
"2â To recognize reciprocallyâ Japan,
the special interests of Russia in Man

Japan Jn Korea.

ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 6.â The
semi-official dispatch of last night from
Vladivostok reporting that, owing to
disturbances between Koreans and
Japanese in Korea, the Russian Second
Rifle Regiment, at Its full strength,
had been dispatched to Korea to pro
tect Russian interests there, created
little comment here. The diplomatists
are disposed to regard It as merely a
move on the diplomatic chessboard.
Only one newspaper, the St. Petersburg
Skija WJedomosti, refers to the dis
patch. It says the movement proves
the flrmnesa of the Russian policy.
The announcement appears to have
created a greater impression in Mos
cow. Commenting thereon, the Mos
kowsklja Wjedomosti declares Russia
Is "ready to fight Japan and a coali
tion, if necessary."
A dispatch from Port Arthur says the
Russo-Japanese crisis is commented
upon by Viceroy AlexienT's newspaper,
the JNbva Kraige, as follows:
"No threats can make Russia aban
don her legitimate rights in Manchuria
or in Korea. The interests of Russia
and Japan can be reconciled without
violating that country's (Korea's) sov
ereignty. The outcome of the negotia
tions depends on the number of iron
clads at Port Arthur and of troops in
?Manchuria. Russia does not fear war,
but she does not desire it and therefore
is seeking to render It impossible."

RUSSIAN' PRESS BOASTFUL.
"That implies the belief, according to
Russian explanation, that Japan will
give her reply much quicker than the
Czar's Government has been able to do.

to reply the Russian and some Euro
pean papers are very pacific, ' but di

Admiral Alexieff's agents are offering large sums . to induce
American and British gunners to desert and go to Port Arthur.
The correspondent adds that Prince Adelbert is reported as
predicting, presumably as a price of German good will, that the
whole province of Shantung will become German territory.
Commenting on the situation the Daily Telegraph adds:
"All of the latest information at hand from Russia confirms the
opinion long since held in diplomatic circles that. the. war party
has got the upper hand in court and that Count Lamsdorf and the
Foreign Office have practically no voice in the ultimate decision. *
If such be the case, peace is hopeless."

to-day that in the event of war his country was in a position to

find difficulty in sending more than 200,000 men.
Minister Ohyma said that the naval forces of Japan were
numerically superior to those of Russia, and, from a military
standpoint, ,were worth double.
"If war breaks out," said the Minister, "it will last for only
a few weeks. I hope for a victory for Japan."

This statement aroused Spooner, who
said that the charge did great injustice
to the Postmaster General.* So far as
the Bristow inquiry was concerned
Payne had been In thorough sympathy
with it and had placed the entire ma
chinery of the department at the com
mand of the official who had made thi3
most remorseless inquiry.
Replying, Carmack disclaimed any
intention to chargfi Payne with com
plicity or sympathy with the Irregu
larities in '_ his . department. His sug
gestion was that of indifference to the
wrong and the natural . inference was
that if the inquiry had . been lef t ?io
him there would have been none.
An agreement was reached to post
pone further discussion of 'the subject
until Friday next.
"If," he said, "this report speaks the
truth Perry Heath originated all the
frauds in his office. If the report Is
not correct the fact should be known'
and Mr. Heath vindicated. If the
charges are well founded Mr. Heath
should be indicted and punished."
â¢ Reference was made to the negotia
tions with G. S. Richardson concerning
the Montague indicator, in which Clay
said there were many suspicious feat
ures pointing to Heath.
Carmack made a- general plea for a
Senatorial inquiry and quoted the
newspaper report to the effect that the
Postmaster General had ,not been in
sympathy with the Postoffice Depart
ment Inquiry when undertaken and
that he pronounced the Tulloch charges
to be "hot air." : ,,:
Clay quoted extracts from the Bris
tow report to substantiate his argu
ntent.
Clay expressed surprise that there
should be opposition to the Carmack
resolution, and called attention to the
declarations by Fourth Assistant Gen
eral Brlstow and Counselors Bonaparte
and Conrad that the Investigation
should be carried further. He declared
that the Bristow report "demonstrates
the absolute guilt of the late First As
sistant Postmaster General, Mr. Heath.
He (Bristow) says himself that this
leading high official was guilty and the
proof overwhelming. If this is true.
Mr. Heath should have been indicted.
I will do Mr. Bristow the credit to say
that his report shows that the frauds
of the Postofflce Department originated
in Heath's office. If so, he must have
had cognizance of them. Then why
should the subordinates in that office
be indicted if the principal be allowed
to escape?"
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6.â Alleged ir
regularities in the Postoffice Depart
ment constituted the only theme In the
Senate to-day. The question came up
on a motion first made by Lodge and
afterward by Penrose" to refer the Car
mack resolution, looking to a Senato
rial investigation of the Postofflce De
partment, to the Committee on Post
offices and Postroads. The Demo
cratic Senators resisted the motion and
contended that the country would not
be satisfied with an investigation of a
department made by the department
itself. The debate continued for al
most two and a half hours and was
extremely spirited from start to finish.
Further consideration of the subject
was deferred until Friday.

took up the search and employed de

until a month ago did she learn of their
v.hereabouts. When she did she acted
quickly.
Arriving in Portland, she appeared
before the courts with documentary evi
dence of the Michigan court's decree
awarding the children to her. A de
tective then proceeded to Dicker's resi
dence and after a bitter scene and a
lengthy consultation with his attorneys
Dicker surrendered the children to their

HORRORS OV THE DISASTER.
Harvey G. Parsons, a writer for the
Topeka State Journal, was on the train.
In his account of the wreck he says:
. "It was in* the third car of the pas
senger tram â the first coach, preceded
by a smoker and baggage car â that the
great slaughter of passengers took
place. The shock drove the smoking
car, which was occupied by only two
or three men, completely over and
through the car behind it, which was
crowded with passengers, some stand
ing: in the aisle, when the shock came.
The passengers In the car where the
numerous deaths^occurred did not feel
any serious . shock. They were first
warned by the total darkness follow
ing the setting of the airbrakes. Then
a mass of splintered wood and iron
crowded down upon them. No one was
thrown out of his seat by the blow.
Out of possibly one hundred persons In
the car about thirty escaped without
injury. They got out, hurriedly, by the
rear door, which, was still unobstructed.
No one in the front half of the car
escaped. They were crushed down be
tween the seats by the smoking car.
Only three living persons were taken
out by the rescuers, who chopped holes
Into the side, floor and; , top* of the
wrecked cars in a frenzied attempt to
rescue a man, a small girl and a mid
dle-aged woman, who were moaning
and begging for aid. The rest of the
passengers in the forward half were"
dead.
"When the collision came we wer- air,
of course. In our berths. I was thrown
from mine and immediately got Into
my clothing to see what was wrong.
The 'condition of â¢ the wrecked train
cannot be described; and, indeed, after
ascertaining that the other train was
a stock train I paid little attention to
it. I saw that medical assistance \Vas
the first thing needed. There were two
young women* in my cai 1 who offered
their services and they worked unhesi
tatingly. I really did not do much, but
these other people did wonders. All of
the people in the sleeper were bundled
out to make room for the injured from
the wreck. We did. not have much in
tha vay of medical appliances, but tore
up sheets for bandages, stopped
wounds as well as we could and made
the injured as comfortable as possible.
The hero of" the wreck was Dr.
Bell of New York City, a . oung physi
cian, crippled and walking on crutches.
Dr. Bell, although slightly hurt as a
result of the collision, was tV"- first man
to leave the Pullman sleeper.which was
not damaged. Struggling heroically
forward on his crutches, he immediate
ly assumed charge of the relief work.
After working until nearly exhausted.
Dr. Bell gave way only when the
phycicians arrived from Topeka with
medicine and instruments. Speaking
of the relief work. Dr. Bell said: .
HERO OF THE WRECK.
"The engineer of the passenger train
had orders to wait at Willard for the
special stock train. He passed on, mis
taking a freight train on the eidlng
at that station for the extra stock
train. This caused the wreck. No
body else is to blame, so far as our In
formation goes."
A formal inquest was held at the
wreck to-day by Coroner Dolley of
Wabaunsee County. The investigation
will be continued to-morrow. Until a
verdict placing the blame i3 returned
no action will be taken against the
trainmen.
The single word "carelessness" will
sum up the reason for the . disaster.
Instructed to meet a special freieht at
Willard', the engineer and conductor
of the passenger train, .noting that a
freight train stood on the sidetrack at
Willard, rushed through, believing
that the cars they had seen were those
which they had been instructed to
pass. Failure to scrutinize the num
ber of the engine was directly respon
sible for the wreck. Had .the engineer
compared the number of the train at
Willard with his orders the catas
trophe would have beÂ«iti prevented.
Upon seeing at Willard a freight
train on the siding, Engineer Benja
min threw open the throttle and under
the impetus of full steam the passen
ger train leaped out into the darkness
and crashed along at a rate which the
passengers declare to have been fully
sixty-five miles an hour. General Su

SALT LAKE, Jan. 7.â For the past
week United States officers have been
searching fruitlessly for Perry Heath,
ex-First Assistant Postmaster General,
to serve upon him papers in connection
with postal frauds cases in the East.
Shortly after midnight Heath arrived
In this city from Denver. ( He denied
that he had been dodging the officials,
and said that he had not heard that
subpenas had been issued for him.
The papers will be served to-morrow.
A subpena Is in the hands of the
United States Marshal here, issued by
the Federal Court of Brooklyn, sum
moning Heath to testify in the case
of Congressman Driggs, who is under
indictment for complicity in the post
oflice frauds.
The subpena arrived here on Decem
ber 17. sent out by United States Dis
trict Attorney Young of Brooklyn. It
demanded the presence of Heath in the
Federal Court of that city to-day, when
the trial of Driggs was scheduled to
begin. Since then the United States
Marshal and his subordir ites have
been making a still hunt for Heath.
For some weeks past United States
Postal Inspectors have been actively
but quietly at work In this city and
vicinity seeking evidence in the cases
growing out of the postal scandal. It
is said that, as the statute of limita
tion has already been held to outlaw
any charges that might be brought
against Heath personally, there can be
no significance in the visit of the in
spectors and the hunt by the Mar
shal's office other than a desire on the
part of the Government to obtain
Heath's testimony in cases now pend
ing against indicted persons.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 6.â District At
torney Morgan H. Beach admitted to
night that a subpena had been issued
from this district for the appearance of
Perry S. Heath in connection with the
trial of postofflce cases of Machen and
others, which will be begun in Justice
Pritchard's court next Monday. The
subpena was issued last week and
should have reached Salt Lake about
Monday. Beach has not been advised
whether any attempts have been made
to serve the subjena or not.
Beach said he understood that a sub
pena had been issued on behalf of the
Government for Heath's presence also
in connection with the trial of former
Representative Driggs, begun in Brook
lyn to-day.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Manager Koonan. In lis evidence, de
clared that Archibald Bernard, the
elec'.riclan. -was depended upon to
operate the skylights and ventilators.
Bernard. \7ho followed Noonan, in
givir.g evidence, said he hai never been
told to look after .the skylights or
ventilators and tha* ' /i post was at
the switchboard, where he had several
hundred lights to manap'. y] <> stage
ventilator, which would probably have
saved. many lives had it been opened,
was. controlled, he declared, from the
side of the stage opposite his post of
duty.
Fifteen other witnesses who had
worked on the stage declared that they
had never received any orders from the
management as to what they should
do In case of . fire. There was never . a
fire drill In the theater, and none of the
stage hands was ever informed as to
the location or use of fire appliances
or the operation of the ventilators over
the auditorium and stage.
That theiemployes in the front of the
EVERY ONE IS CARELESS.
From figures obtained by N'oonan to
day it became evident that, almost one
In three of the people who attended
the matinee lost their lives, the per
centage being a trifle over 31 per cent.
The theater seated 1606 people and in
addition to thesÂ« 236 had been admitted
after all seats> were sold, making a
total of 1842 people In the theater, of
whom 591 were killed.
Manager Xoonan declared that the
two balconies, including seats and peo
ple standing, held 889 people. The total
number of fatalities in the fire is to
date 591, of whom three were killed on
the first floor. This would make, ac
cording to Manager Noonan's state
ment, 588 deaths out of 889 people In
the two balconies.
Will J. Davis testified that he had
given no orders to place a fire alarm
box Mn the 'theater; that he had given
no direction to place a pump upon the
stage, beyond the fact that any ap
paratus the firemen wanted should be
provided as soon as possible. He de
clared he could not say as to whether
the building had been finally accepted
from the 1 Fuller Company or not. He
admitted that he never had given any
instructions to anybody as to what
should be done In case of fire.' He had
no knowledge as to whether the theater
had received a final certificate of In
spection from the building department
of the city before opening or not.
Po- ers gave evidence substantially
the same rs that of Davis.
Noonan declared that no person had
been named by the theater manage
ment to superintend the operation of
the ventilators in case of fire and in
consequence the flames had been per
mitted to sweep the. place Instead of
seeking a natural outlet through the
stage ceiling. It was said by Noonan
that G. M. Dusenbery, the head usher;
Archibald Bernard, chief electrician,
and the theater engineer knew how to
operate the ventilators. -It was proven
by the evidence of these men, however,
that two of the"m never went upon the
stage and that the. other had never been
tuld to assume charge of the ventilators
in case of fire. Dusenbery.declared.that
his duty as usher kept him in the front
of the house. The engineer was also
below the stage attending to his. engine
and Bernard, the only one of the three
knowing how to operate the ventilators
who Was ever upon the stage during a
performance, testified that he had never
been told to assume charge of them.
ONE-THIRD ARE KILLED.,
Noonan, who is the working manager
of the theater under direction of Davis
and Powers, admitted to-day that
eleven of the theater exits were locked
and bolted. Two Of these exits, leading
to the front of the theater on the
ground floor, w-ere locked; three addi
tional exits on the north side of the
ground floor were bolted, three exits
on -.the north side of the theater from
the first balcony were bolted and three
exits on the north side of the second
bal<?ony were bolted.
The greatest Iobs of life from the fire
was in the first and second balconies,
when; hundreds of people were suffo
cated through their inability to get
out or were trampled to death while
trying to do so. Had these three exits
in each balcony been available, accord
ing to Fulkerson, the loss of life must
have been greatly diminished.
VENTILATORS NOT USED.
CHICAGO, Jan. 6.â By their own evi

ater. They admitted their failure to
instruct employes In fighting fire -and
failure even to provide suitable appli

statements were corroborated by the
testimony of twenty employes of the

placed 5530 in a local bank. He met ''

wealth, and that he intended to again \
start in business. The sharpers ad- i
vised him to buy some spurious coin, f
which, they . declared, was made of
genuine metal and impossible of detec
tion. Cailo drew his money from the
bank and went to San Francisco with '
the men. Negotiations were entered '
into and Cailo exchanged his $530 for
$1500 of seemingly good coin. The
money was counted, out in his presence
and put in a satchel for him to bring*
to this city. He was cautioned not to
open the valise until he arrived here.
When he did so in his room he found
two nicely wrapped bricks in the valise
Cailo has now removed to Redwood

The registration of visitors of the
California â¢ State. v Boar ; d, of Trade for
the year 1903 has been summarized by
direction of Manager Arthur R.
Briggs. This shows that there were
actually 137,000 visitors to the exhibi
tion hall of the board during the
twelve months of the year just closed,
an- average of more than' 11,000 per
month. Not all of this great throng
put their names on the registry books,
that are placed within convenient
reach, but the reliable ratio of regis
trations to visitors makes it clear that
rather more than 137,000 visitors in
spected the exhibits maintained by. the
board in the interest â¢ of California
counties during the period mentioned.
This showing demonstrates the value of
having a permanent . exhibit in this
city of California products, as only
those who are interested in the State
will-take the time to inspect. In the
registrations every State in the Union
was represented and also about every
civilized country in the world. The

Death of Famous Scientist,

Avoid Kxjx'ii'-ive Construction of
Tunnel Through Mountains.
The recent statement made by E.
Harriman to the effect that consid
ation of plans for tunneling through
e Sierras for the purpose of over
mine the steep grades on both
les of Summit had been indefinitely
ferred is now followed by the an
uncement that another and cheaper
ojert for accomplishing the same
end is being carefully looked into by
the president and general manager of
Southern Pacific Company. It
- was stated at. the offices of the -rail
i road company yesterday, that there
3 has been submitted to Harriman a
plan for a third rail between Sacra
mento and Truckee, by which means
. big electric motor cars may be op
â¢ erated on the line between the points
mentioned as an additional power for
assisting heavy trains over the steep
crades. A part of the plan is to de
velop electric power from the waters
. of the Truckee River at some eleva
| tion on that stream yet to be selected.
I It is claimed that sufficient power can
be acquired to move the heaviest
trains operated by the Southern Pa
cific on a time schedule several
' faster than the one under which traf
fic now moves over the mountain
grades and that the saving in coal
alone will be many thousands of dol
lars every month. As a substitute for
-the expensive construction of a long
tunnel it will save the Southern Pa
5 ciflc Company millions of dollars. The
plans for the electric- power system
were submitted to President Harri
mintwo -weeks ' ago Â¦ ami since then
he and General Manager Kruttschnitt
have been corresponding at length re
garding the proposition. General
Manager Kruttschnitt expects to go
East in a few weeks and will then
take the matter up with President

reported at the Presidio yesterday and
was assigned to temporary duty at the
post hospital. <
The great guns at Fort Baker were
in action yesterday morning and shook
the buildings and' rattled the windows
at the Presidio in a very lively fashion.
The slasher of Mrs. Carney has not
been identified yet, although 'Detective
Reynolds was at the post all the after
noc-n yesterday trying to get. him lo-'
cated. He had the full assistance of
the officers of the post, but he 'was
handicapped by the apparent apathy
of the principals and the witnesses of
the scrap to give him any help in the
matter.
The squadron of Ninth Cavalry sta
tioned at the Presidio passed in re
view yesterday morning before their
new commander, Major John Bigelow
Jr. It was the first time . % the. entire
squadron had been called out together
since it returned here from its six
months' sojouKn in Yosemite^ Valley.
The exercises, which began at 8:30
a. m., consisted of the. usual ceremo
nies of review, according to drill regu
lations. The squadron was in fine
shape, and the different.. troopsâ I, K,
L and Mâ acquitted themselves in a
satisfactory manner. At the clcrse of
the inspection as they dashed around"
the drill grounds at full gallop, with
sabers drawn and the bright guidons
floating to the breeze, they presented
a brilliant appearance.
Following the review Major Bigelow
made a full inspection of the troops,
which were in dress uniform; At the
close of the inspection the buglers
sounded the officers' call, and the new
commander made a sliort address to
the captains of the different troops, and
at 10:30 the recall was sounded and
the squadron left the field for the sta

Policeman J. B. Hurd and Special
Officer Smith were called, and they hur
ried to the lodcing-house and placed
Drew under arrest. He was taken to
the City Prison and two charges of
burglary were placed against him.
When Drew was searched at the City
Prison a leather card case engraved
"A. B. A., San Francisco, 1903," was
found in his pocket. Inside was a
pawn ticket for a fur cape with the
signature "Grace Austin," and the date
August 21, 1903. The police suspect that
Drew stole the fur cape and they want
the owner to make herself known.
The police say Drew is known among
pickpockets as "Mickey O'Dea." For
some months he has been lame from
rheumatism, and not being able to run
after picking a pocket he has devoted
his attention to stealing from rooms in
lodging-houses. He has been arrested
numerous times, but has always es
caped conviction.
Wooster became suspicious and,
jumping out of bed, followed his visitor
downstairs. Drew warned him not to
follow, and, dropping his booty, struck
Wooster a blow on the head with his
fist. Wooster clinched with him and
being the stronger of the two soon had
Drew on his back on the floor.
Frank DreÂ»\ a well known pickpockr
et, visited the lodging-house of Mrs.
Loring at 219A Mason street about 4
o'clock yesterday morning and entered
the room of Walter Lorir^g. He lit the
gas and helped himself to an overcoat,
a sack coat and vest, a pair erf scis
sors, a knife, a pair of spectacles and
$1 10 In silver. Loring awoke, and
Drew turned out the gas,- remarking.
"It's time for you to get up," so as to
allay suspicipn.
After leaving Loring's room. Drew
upened a trunk belonging to Miss Jo
sephine Hayes. It was in the hallway,
and the burslar stole a pair of gloves,
a pin cushion and two handkerchiefs.
He then entered the room of George
Wooster, and after he had collected a
bundle of clothing, a knife and memo
randum book Wooster awoke. Wooster
asked him what he wanted, an# Drew,
turning out the light, said, "It's time
for you to get up."
After inditing a farewell note to
his parents. George Godfrey of 2S2
Sagamore street. Ocean View, placed
a pistol to his head in the presence of
his wife and daughter and, after they
had run from the room, sent a bullet
crashing into his brain.
Godfrey returned home early last
evening under the influence of liquor
and entered the front room of his
house. His wife and daughter, Etta,
were in the apartment and, whipping
out the revolver, he placed the muzzle
to his head. The' terrified wife and
daughter ran screaming from the room
to the rear yard. In a moment there
was a report and, after summoning an
officer, they again entered the house.
Godfrey was found lying dead on the
floor in a pool of blood. The Coroner
was notified, but the body was not re
moved to the Morgue.: Godfrey's par
ents reside in South San Francisco.
The note assigns despondency as the
reason for his act.

Leo R. Wefll, loan teller of the bank.
, A. W. Naylor, president of the First
National Bank of Berkeley, produced a !
deposit tag for $3515, which showed that '
McKowen had deposited to hi3 own |
account a draft on the Crocker-Wool
worth Bank in that amount, and fur
ther record of the bank proved that the
embezzling secretary had checked
against this deposit .to his own account. ;
This draft was one of those McKowen
had issued to him by the Union Sav
ings Bank against the Hearst check.
-Victor H. Henderson, private secre
tary,, to President Wheeler of the uni
versity and acting secretary of the
Board of Regents, gave eviderfce con
cerning the demand made upon Mc-
Kowen to repay $3515. President Wheel
er testified that -the department of
anthropology was supported, solely by
the contributions from Mrs. Hearst and
that Its funds were under the control
of the Board of Regents. Expert Nor
man McLaren's testimony was that
McKowen had said he was unable to
meet the demand for the return of the I
money. John A. Britton, a member of!

DRAFTS IDENTIFIED.
District Attorney J.' J. Allen and
Charles E. Snook, attorney for the
Board of Regents, 'conducted the ex
amination of the prosecution's wit
nesses. The case hinges upon the spe
cific accusation of the embezzlement of
$3515 from the funds of the anthro
pological department of the university,
the amount being a portion of the
money contributed to the support of
that branch by Mrs. Phebe A. Hearst.
Testimony covering the manipula
tions by McKowen "of a check for
$6522 90 sent to the secretary by Rich
ard A. Clark, agent for the Hearst
estate, after McKowen had in May last
notified Clark that the amount was re
quired as balance due the anthropo
logical fund, was Introduced. Copies of
McKowen's letter, the check itself and
McKowen's acknowledgment of the re
ceipt of the check were placed in evi
dence. " .
CHECK MANIPULATION.
No testimony was offered in behalf
of McKowen, nor was there any cross
examination of the witnesses for the
State by Attorney H. M. Wright, who
appeared for. McKowen.
That McKowen will plead guilty to
the charge of embezzlement when he
shall have been arraigned in the Su
perior Court is certain, It will then be
a case for the presentation of such a
statement at the defaulting secretary's
representative deems best as an argu
ment in favor of mitigation of punish
ment.
W. A. McKowen, self-confessed em
bezzler of funds of the University of
California, which were stolen while he
was secretary of the Board of Regents,
was to-day held to , ar.3wer in $20,000

â¢ 1118- Broadway, Jan. 6.
The funeral of Madame Paget will be
held at 10::30 o'clock to-morrow from
the late residence, 2727 Dwlght way.
The service will be conducted by the
Rev. Joseph Worcester of the Swenden
borgian Church of San Francisco, the
lifelong friend of the famllv. The pall
bearers . will be Professor William
Carey Jones, Louis de F. Bartlett,
Frank M. Wilson and J. S. Bunnell.
Neither Professor nor Madame
Paget ever spoke about their affairs,
and even their intimate friends knew
nothing of the debt on the family
estate in France, destroyed during the
Franco-Prussian War, which both
obligated themselves "to pay. She was
the business manager of the house
hold. He loved only his books and did
not want the annoyance attendant on
business affairs, and but for her watch
ful eye the Paget estate would be much
more reduced than it appears to be.
During the years Professor and
Madame Paget taught the languages
in San Francisco they were very suc
cessful. Professor Paget, though al
most always uncommunicative about
his own affairs, one day told Professor
Spinello that his wife often earned $250
a month by giving lessons in French
and.ln.musie. This money, or rather
the most of it, went to pay the debt on
the estate in. France. ..â
nnated to be worth 512,000.
.It would take all of this $12,000 to
found the : scholarship' provided in
Madame Pdget's will alone. The inter
est on that sum would bring' only
about $480 annually to pay the scholar
ship. But out of this $12,000 there must
be paid the debts and mortgages on
the estate, which include doctor's bills
and the like, so that, after all, it does
not look as if there would be much
left to pay such bequests as the
Â¦scholarship, the sum of $300 to Mrs.
Harley Leete, $500 to the Rev. Joseph
Worcester and several other amounts.
3 "I do not believe the executor will be
able, to do all that Madame Paget re
quested in her will," said Professor
Marius Splnello, the Pagets* most in
timate friend. -"I know the estate is
heavily incumbered and, after all the
debts are paid, there will be little left.
Professor Paget told me just before
his death that he hoped he would die
before his wife, as he would not leave
an estate large enough to support her
in^her infirmity.
"Madame Paget's death was due a
good deal to the hard work attending
the nursing of her husband, to whom
she was devoted. She confided in me
that she was unable to afford the ex
pense lof a nurse and wore herself out
attending to him."
The estate consists' principally of
three houses and realty, all more or
less mortgaged. There are two houses
on Haste street, the family residence on
Dwight* way, arid some real estate in
Oakland.' These, together with a small
amount of personal property, *are esti-
'.Some doubt is felt among the friends
of the" late v Professor and Madame
,Paget as to .whether enough of their
estate remains to ' pay the bequests
made, by Madame Paget in her will.
Investigation discloses that the estate
is heavily incumbered by debts, which
accrned mainly during the long illness
of Professor Paget, and unless there Is
some property that their friends knew
;riothing about there "-will hardly be
enough to settle the prdinary obliga
tions. ':

"On the morning of December 17,
between 10:30 and noon, four flights
were made, two by Orville Wright and
two by Wilbur Wright. The starts were
all made from a point on the level near
our camp in Dare County, North Caro
lina. The wind at the time of the
flights had a velocity of twenty-seven
miles an hour. The flight was made di
rectly against the wind. Each time the
machine started froYn the level ground
by its own power, with no assistance
from gravity or other sources what
ever. After a run of about eight inches
on the ground it arose from the track,
and under the direction of the operator
climbed upward on an inclined course
till a height eight or ten, feet from the
ground was reached, after which the
course was kept as near horizontal as
the wind gusts and the limited skill of
the operator would permit. The flyer
made its way forward with a speed of
ten miles an hour over the ground and
of thirty to thirty-five miles an hour
through the air. The flight was short.
"The succeeding flights rapidly in
creased in length, and at the fourth
trial a flight of fifty-nine seconds was
made, in which the machine flew a lit
tle more than a. half mile through the
air and a distance of more than 852
feet over the ground. All of the ex
periments have been conducted at our
own expense, without assistance from
any individual or institution."
DAYTON. Ohio, Jan. 6.â The Wright
brothers, inventors of the flying machine
which has attracted such widespread
attention, have prepared the following,
which they say is the first correct
statement of the two successful trials
made by them:
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6.â Reports of
great destitution and threatened star
vation among the inhabitants of Fair
banks, Alaska, having reached the Wai-
Department through a communication
of the Mayor of that place, addressed
to Senator Nelson, General Funston,
commanding the Department of the
Columbia, was directed to make an in
vestigation and to take such steps as
would conserve the public peace while
affording relief. The Mayor specially
requested that staple supplies be not
given, but sold, to thes= people from
supplies on hand at Fort Gibbons.
V/hile General Funston was. carrying
out these instructions Captain Smith,
stationed at Fort Egbert, Alaska,
wired the department thai he had re
ceived information from Lieutenant
Llckard, who was at Fairbanks as latÂ«
as December 2?, that he neither saw
nor heard of any famine: that there
has been a shortage of supplies, oc
casioned by an early freeze, but that
freighting /had been going on steadily

SAN BERNARDINO, Jan. 6.â Two of
San Bernardino's most favored young
people stole a march on their relatives
and friends last evening and were
united in marriage in Los Angeles. The
bride was Miss Frances E. Perdew, a
daughter of Mrs. Jeanette Perdew, and
the groom Is Francis E. Gazzolo, th-Â»
second son of Mr. and Mrs. P. D. Gaz
zolo. The bride's mother recently re
moved to Fresno and it was presum
ably for that city that iliss Perdew left
yesterday afternoon. Gaszolo acqom
panying her as far as Los Angeles. IShe
had been the guest of Miss Minnie Gaz
zolo for several weeks at â¢ the Gazzolo
residence on C street and her mother
was expecting her at her northern home
to-day, but the young couple evidently
could not bear the thought of separa
tion and chose their own method of
preventing it. The wedding took place
last evening in the parsonage of the
church of New Jerusalem at Los Ange
les. The relatives of the young couple
received telegrams this morning telling
the news and letters are on the way.
Gazzolo and his bride left this morning
by steamer for Portland, where they
will make their home. Tlie groom, who
has been studying medicine, has se
cured the position of assistant surgeon
in one of the Portland hospitals.

OFFICERS ELECTED.
An increase of wages ranging from
2 to 3 cents an hour is asked by
the machinists in the employ of the
Southern Pacific Company. The de
mand will be probably be granted In
some, if not all, the shops.
The dispute between the members
of the Stablemen's Union and the Car
riage Qwners' Association seems no
nearer settlement than ever and a
strike is still imminent. The executive
committee of the Labor Council has
the matter in hand and will make an
advisory report at the meeting of the
council to-njorrow night. The mem
bers of the committee refuse to di
vulge the nature of the report, .but it
will have an important bearing on the
matter. A conference was held last
night between the men and the own
ers' association, but no action was
taken, it being deemed more advisable
to await the action of the Labor Coun
cil.
SAN RAFAEL. Jan. 6.â The State
Board of Prison Directors met at San
uentin prison this afternoon and was
surprised by a report presented by the
"Warden which showed the funds of the
prison to be in a badly depleted condi
tion. The general fund is nearly ex
hausted and the sale of jute bags will
not be sufficient to tide over the diffi
culty. The expense of the prison has
been greater than usual and the
amount apportioned to it, rapidly di
minished. To meet the demands
against the prison and pay the con
tracts awarded for good3 during the
coming year it will become necessary
to borrow money.
The Directors decided to meet with
the State Board of Examiners at Sac
ramento next Friday and ask them to
borrow enough money to meet all de
mands until the meeting of the Legis
lature.
When the Question of towels for the
use of the prisoners came up Warden
Tompkins said it would be too much
of a luxury. The board looked at it
differently and gave orders that the
price of towels be ascertained and at
the next meeting towels will be se
cured.
The charge by Convict Gardalli to
the effect that Captain McClure, who
was the turnkey at the "prison, had re
ceived money from him and never gave
him credit for the same, was dismissed
by the board. Gardalii's actions before
the board convinced them that he i's
slightly demented.
D. J. Sullivan of San Francisco, who
while acting as bond and warrant
clerk forged the name of a Police Judge
to a bond and was sentenced to six
years*, imprisonment, was paroled.
Robert Wilson, serving a life sen
tence from Tulare; John Burk. serving
twelve rears from Los Angeles, and
Walter O'Garrick, serving seven years
from Alameda, were â¢ also paroled.
The Directors will meet at Folsom
next Saturday.

Â«-rnt to the links and outside" the post
have cost nearly $20,000. Of course the
house could be moved away: its ar

rrmodel it into a living house. The im

however, be taken away, so Uncle Sam

"When the San Francisco Golf Ciub
allied permission to be allowed to use
that portion of Presidio for its links
it was understood from General Gra

from General MacArthur that they
might be called upon at any time to

the time has probably arrived they be-

The new commanding: officer. Major
John Bigelow Jr., after witnessing: the
review yesterday saw that the grounds
were not ample to fully meet with
Uncle Sam's requirements and he at
once decided that a much larger field
was necessary. He looked about for
a more available spot on, the reserva
tion and naturally his eyes fell on the
spacious grounds now used by thÂ«
coifers. They are in the finest condi
tion, high and dry. and there is in the
whole country, in such proximity to
any great city.- no grounds of such
magnitude or so fully adequate to meet
nil the present needs of the cavairy
for a drilling: ground.
The members of the San Francisco
Golf Club were thrown intoSa great
state of excitement yesterday afternoon
v. hen the rumor reached them that thÂ«
links at the Presidio were to be turned
into a drill ground. This of course
would put an end to the sport in the
immediate vicinity of San Francisco.
The rumor originated from the fact
that the squadron of the Ninth Cavalry
now stationed at the Presidio has been
ordered to go Into daily drill. The
present grounds on the flat are suf
ficient for drilling a single troop, but
when it comes to having the whole
squadron in the field they are entirely
inadequate.

chtrgtt.' - J . . ' |RECENT reports from Helsingfors, a town in the
north of Finland, carry the news of a piece of
Russian officialism which may have more import
to it than appears on the surface. A Swedish engineer,
Mr. Bjordklund, acting as the agent in Finland for a Ger
man manufacturer, was suddenly seized as a spy and cast
into prison, and because he refused to confess to any se
ditious acts against the Government was compelled to
remain in a cell all night, entirely stripped of his cloth
ing. The next morning the Russian officials pretended
to discover that their prisoner was a subject of the
Swedish King,' and they dismissed him summarily. King
Oscar's Ministers have set an inquiry on foot at the
court of St. Petersburg, but after the lapse of almost
three months no diplomatic reply has been made by the
Czar's Government.
'Idle as it may seem to attempt a. prediction of future
events, this latest piece of despotism in down-trodden
Finland, considered in conjunction with the well-known
devious ways of Russian diplomacy, must compel a.
thoughtful consideration of the bit of underground
statecraft this seemingly insignificant incident re
veals. Great as the roar and the bluster may be be
tween the Muscovite and the Jap in their sparring about
for an opportune moment in which to knock the chip off
the other fellow's shoulder, the wise ones who know the
tricks of the Tartar of the north are instinctively look
ing about to find the cause of his recent movements in
Finland.
One of the most characteristic features of , Russian di
plomacy has been that of taking advantage of a diver
sion to effect a coup in a direction, undreamed of.; Here
is Russia on the verge of a war which. must necessarily
be a bitter one and which will carry. with it the destinies
of all the East. So delicately poised is the balance of
European diplomac3V that England and France are al
ready beginning to polish up their sabers for use!ihcase
of emergency. Diplomatists have not hesitated to say
that the Eastern embroglio might develop into a general
European conflict such as that which marked the Rus
sian move to annex the Crimea. Granting the possi
bility of, even a partial fulfillment of these predictions,
it is not beyond the power of belief that in the, confusion
of a war. between herself and one or more of. the: powers
Russia would make a sudden grab -at a piece of "terri
tory within the locked province of ; Europe itself.
That territory would be upon the Scandinavian-pen
insula. It is 'not for naughts that for thepast ten years

have all done splendid pioneer work.
Howard Elliott, the new president of
the Northern Pacific system, is one of
the best types of the capable, self
reliant and progressive young railroad
man. At the age of 40 years he is at
the head of one of the most important
and prosperous railway systems in the
world and so great is the confidence
that the principal owners of the prop
erty repose in him that no restraint has
been placed upon his policy or methods.
Mr. Elliott attended Harvard College
while Theodore Roosevelt was there,
and although they were not class
mates they became close friends. Dur
ing Mr. Elliott's first visit to New York
after his election to his present posi
tion he was summoned to the White
House to receive congratulations and
enjoy a sociable luncheon with his dis
tinguished college mate.
The advancement of Mr. Elliott
made way for the advancement of an
other young man who has shown re
markable capacity for doing a great
variety of things in the railway ser
vice. Daniel Willard, who succeeds El
liott as second vice president of the
great Burlington system, had just be
gun to make a record as first vice
president of the Erie. His new posi
tion, however, will give him a larger
sphere of action. Beginning as a track
laborer, Mr. Willard has come up
through every grade In the operating
department â brakeman. fireman, en
gineer, conductor, station agent, sec
tion boss, division superintendent, as
sistant superintendent, superintendent,
general manager, etc.
Cornelius Vanderbilt's activities in
the railroad field now embrace both
the mechanical and financial depart
ments. It is just ten years ago that
this young man first put on overalls
and went into the New York Central
machine shops to find out how to
build a locomotive. He learned his les
son thoroughly and he has been devis
ing alterations and improvements to
the locomotive ever since. He has
taken out a dozen or more patents and
the Vanderbilt firebox is now widely
used on freight engines. For the past
few years Mr. Vanderbilt has been giv
ing much attention to the perfection
of a new type of tank car.
John D. Rockefeller Jr. came into
public view as a railroad man about
three years ago, when Wall-street
brokers traced purchases of several
blocks of Missouri Pacific stock to him
and Howard Gould. Young Rocke
feller showed astuteness in buying
when prices were at their lowest. He
is credited with having picked up con
siderable St. Paul, Union Pacific and
Lackawanna stock during the succes
sive "bear raids" on the general mar
ket It was through young Rockefel
led's initiative that his family be
came â as it is now believed to be â
the largest individual stockholder- in
the Missouri Pacific road. John D.
Jr. is a director of the Missouri, Kan
sas and Texas Railroad, which is prac
tically owned outright by Rockefeller
interests. It is the policy, of John D.
Rockefeller ] Sr. to keep in the back
ground and put his son, as well as his
brother, William, into the directorates
of the properties in which the family;
has an important interest. At pres- j
ent therefore John D. Jr. is simply his I
father's representative in railroad j
boards. He is intelligent, cool-headed
and judicious and may. yet develop a
forceful individuality of his own.
Howard Elliott's election to the presi
j dency of the Northern Pacific Railway,
' Corneliu" Vanderbilt's active Interest
j in the affairs of the Illinois Central, the
j entry of William K. Vanderbilt Jr. into
| f.. > financial department of the New
j York Central, the placing of John D.
; Rockefeller Jr. on important commlt
| tees in the Lackawanna directorate and
| the designation of Fourth Vice Presl
j dent Samuel Rea of the Pennsylvania
i to have full charge of the $50,000,000
j tunnel and terminal work at |.'ew York
j are the most recent and conspicuous
j evidences that young men are rapidly
j coming to the front in railroad man
j agement.
James J. Hill, who is training his son
to take his place as the head of the
Great Northern system, said to the
writer of this sketch not long ajo: "It
j is to the young men that the railroads
j of this country must look t< r progres

But what are the facts? People give
to their homes the frazzled ends of

the benefit of all the doubt there is.
The exactions of the outside world are
terrible. But after all, it is not so
much "necessity" as lack of correct
ideas that accounts for most men
bringing home nothing but the dregs
of their best selves. Women pour their
strength into the toil of mere house
keeping with the reckless waste of
prodigals and have nothing left but
quivering nerves and exasperated tem

describing the tyranny of cooking and
cleaning and mending. But who does
not know that a higher conception of
domestic life and nobler ideals of moth

save up the best of all their fund of
energy for the contact with children

In every one of us there is a "best"
and "'worst." We have cream and

Some men give their best to their

the "un'on" or "league" that you see
the full display of their mental re
sources. All their powers are saved

As for the women, many devote

A Little Home Sermon.
The evidence given in the case ought to be carefully
followed by all persons charged with .responsibility in the
management of theaters or with the official duty of inspect
ing them. It will not do to attribute the calamity wholly
to bad architecture, and limit inspection to similar mat
ters in other theaters. Attention should be paid to the
evidence concerning the blunders of the employes at the
time of the fire, and efforts made to see to.it that in all
theaters the employes be carefully drilled and disci
plined in the duties required of them when fire occurs.
AS the investigation of the Chicago disaster pro
gresses, it becomes^ more and more evident that
the calamity was the result not so much of any
defect in the construction of the Iroquois Theater as of
carelessness on the part of those in charge of the opera
tion of the mechanism of its various departments. .. From
evidence reported as having been given before the coro
ner, it appears that the fire might have been extinguished
or burned itself out harmlessly if only the employesÂ»had
been thoroughly drilled in the duties expected of them
in case of just such an emergency as occurred.
The asbestos drop curtain would have swung down in
to* place between the stage and the auditorium all right
if the reflector lights along the arch had been first swung
back where they belonged. It was the projection of
those lamps that interfered and prevented the descent of
the curtain, and it: would have been easy to swing them
out of the way had any one thought of doing so. One
witness testifies there had been a small blaze on the
stage some two weeks before the big fire took place, and
that it was noted at the time that the asbestos curtain
could not work while the obstruction was in the way;
and yet after that fact was made known nothing was
done either to free the curtain of the obstruction, or to
drill some one into the practice of swinging, the reflec
tors out of the way the moment the call for dropping the
asbestos curtain was given.
One of the chief causes of the terrible loss of life was
the darkness that fell upon the theater almost as soon
as the flames burst forth into the auditorium. It seems
clear that had there been ample light there would have
been less of a panic, and a chance for the escape of many
who perished because they could not see which way to
turn for safety. It is now reported that the theater was
equipped with an emergency lighting plant for use in
case the ordinary lights went out. That equipment was
in place and in good order, and had any one of the offi
cers or employes of the theater thought to turn the
switch there would have been an immediate illumination
of the auditorium, the corridors and the halls of the
building.
A third ' cause of the great fatality was the lack of a
shaft f6r the escape of the flames upward through the
roof; and yet just such a means of providing for the
safety of the theater had 'been arranged by the architect.
Above the stage were skylights which were designed ;to
open automatically under certain conditions, and thus
make a draft that would carry flames on the stage
straight upward and away from the auditorium or the
dressing-rooms. The skylight, it appears, did not open.
Efforts are now being* made to find out why, and there is
an ugly story of its having been battened down. At any
rate it might have been opened even after the automatic
mechanism had failed to work if only some one had been
drilled into doing it whenever fire occurred.
Here then are three instances of gross carelessness re
ported on that oneocasion, and each of them had much
to do with augmenting the calamity. By reason of one
the flames could find ;no outlet through the roof and
were driven into the auditorium; by reason of another
the asbestos' curtain designed to protect the auditorium
would not work; by reason of the third the building was
left in total darkness when it might have been amply
lighted. What possible architectural foresight could
guard against such terrible mistakes on the part of the
persons in charge cf the building?

The installation in theaters of steel curtains, to be
operated several times during every performance, has
been suggested as a necessary precaution against dis
asters, such as that which so recently threw the nation
into gloom. Common sense dictates that no theater
should be permitted to open its doors without this ordi
nary protection to its patrons. It will be' interesting to
follow the spirit with which municipal officers accept the
suggestion.
JAPAN'S KEEN MOVE.
JAPANESE statesmen are proving themselves the
. equal of any. They have watched the aggressions
of Russia upon China, that would have caused war
with any but" that helpless power. They have protested,
and have asked for explanation" and for understanding,
but no satisfactory response- has come from Russia.
Now, instead of declaring war and assuming the awful
responsibility of; breaking the world's peace, Japan - in
vesjts Korea, occupies the seaports of that" hermit: king
dom and says to Russia hands off. just as Russia says
hands off in Manchuria. * I
If .Russia attempt to interfere, there will be powder
burned, but Russia, by this highly strategic move, is
compelled to, assume the offensive and intrude upon or
attack Japan. China and the Western nations, as well

necessary by the peninsula's command of the Japanese
islands. What she has done now is entirely within her

a man came up before the Judge on a
charge of disturbing the peace. His
attorney made a strong plea for him,
telling the Judge that the defendant
was a good man and had a wife and

The Quality of Mercy.
On examining his prize, Mr. Hubbard
found the interwined monograms of
Henry II. and Diana of Poitiers â two
"D's" and an "H" â in ten places, as
well as the three interlaced crescents
which formed Diana's own crest, while
on the four corners waa the crowned
"H" of the monarch. There is no doubt
that the casket is one presented by
the King to his favorite.
The box, which is about eighteen
inches long and nine inches wide, 13 of
wood covered with beautiful gesso
work. It stands on eight silver acorns,
and at the corners of the lid and body
are elaborate silver ornaments. The
most curious feature is a silver Moorish
dome on the top. Experts suggest that
it may be hollow, and that there may
be something concealed within it. But
Mr. Hubbard has been unable to find
any opening.
"The find is unique." said an expert,
"and it would probably fetch Â£5000 to
morrow if put up for sale by auction."
In a few days the casket will be ex
hibited at South Kensington Museumâ

approval, and after a day or two wrote,

check.

Old Romance Unveiled.
But Avho are the three? Livernash is one, and it is
said that another hired man of Mr. Hearst graces a seat
from Chicago, who makes the second. But who, who is
the third? Perish the thought, or at least let something
unpleasant be done to the thought, that it is the Hon.
William Randolph Hearst himself! He informs us every
day in his newspapers that he is the noblest American
and the dandiest leader now up for public inspection,
and what must we think of our countrymen, or at least
that part of our fellow citizens who sit on the Demo
cratic side in Congress, if this leader of leaders is com
pelled to pull himself from oblivion by the seat of his
political trousers by voting for himself "to make it three!
What are we to think of Cleveland getting more votes
than Hearst! More, do we say? So much more that
the champion of the people, whose left hand stands yell
ing its achievements at his right until his dexter paw
has the earache, seems not in it. What ails his unappre
ciative brother members? Don't they take his news
papers and read therein what a matchless man he is?
Ingersollian echo.
There is evidence abroad now that the power of the
convention is about to be shorn, at least in the Demo
cratic party. There is a visible tendency to settle the
Presidential nomination by agreement of members of
Congress, leaving to the convention the lighter duty of
ratifying such action and the heavy task of listening to
speeches. With this in view there is repeated polling of
Democratic members of Congress, to develop their
Presidential preferences. In these several pollings the
Strength of some of the candidates fluctuates. It ebbs
and flows like the tide, and rises and falls like the
sounds of the night. But one candidate holds his
strength without variableness or shadow of turning. He
holds his own every time. His party in "California will
be proud to know that this inflexible and non-fluctuat
ing candidate is Mr. William Randolph Hearst.
While Cleveland, Gorman, Olney and Parker experi
ence the vicissitudes of political fortune, our own Will
iam Randolph simply and strongly dittos his vote
every time. But when the matter is looked in another
light its features are less reassuring. His total strength
is three votes. While the others run up into the scores
he gets always three votes, no more, no less. When it
is remembered that since the middle of November Wil
liam Randolph Hearst has been seated in the House hob
nobbing with his fellow members and meeting the
large number who have been his guests on yachts and
special trains, and who have acted as "commissioners" of
his several papers _ in settling the gyrations of the solar
system, this seems a small result.
FORMERLY candidates, for the Presidency were
nominated by a caucus of Congressmen. This was
before conventions had been devised. â¢ The first
national political convention was held in 1832 to nomi
nate a running mate for Andrew Jackson. Prior to that
time there was not much platform making. Mr. Jeffer
son's inaugural served as the platform of the Republi
can patty, which he organized. Sometimes an action in
Congress or a resolution in caucus was all the expres
sion of partisan purpose that was necessary, and then
the people fell to and fell as foul of each other as they
do now.
The convention of 1832 changed all of that. It was
seen that a national convention was a better place than
Congress to bring men together for consultation. The
party orators, who theretofore had mixed spell binding
with grain binding in campaigns in the rural districts,
were proud to put their figures of speech on the market
in a great convention. So political oratory rose as the
conventions gained in importance, and reached its cli
max in Ingersoll's speech nominating Since
then no nominating orator in any convention, State o"r
National, has ever got away from the ascriptive "the man
who," until Mr. Lane was nominated " for . Governor of
California. That nominating speech, made by Mr. Seth
Mann, was a model of good taste and. was free from the
A RANK TAIL-ENDER.
Up to this time the work of making
the crop had been done altogether by
the three boys, with an occasional bit
of assistance "from their father. Extra
help was employed in the harvest, how
ever, and when the corn was gathered
and measured into Mr. Rankin's great
corn bins, it was found that the boys
had grown 34,621 bushels of corn. At 12
cents per bushel this netted the hand
some sum of $4134 52. and Mr. Rankin
gave them a check for that amount.
The corn was of splendid quality.
When the account of the feat reached
the Missouri World's Fair Commission
ers they determined to honor the boyÂ«
by a World's Fair exhibit. Some of the
corn was obtained, and it will occupy a
place of honor in the Missouri agricul
ture exhibit.
a requisition made on the Missouri
mule, and six were attached to each of
three two-row cultivators. The weeds
were kept down, the soil loosened and
the corn grew. This cultivating was
gone through with three times. Mean
while the corn had grown and ripened
and when November rolled around the
crop was made and the harvest waa
begun.
David Bennett Hill, rising to the. stern emergency
of public address, has spoken and says he doesn't like
President Roosevelt. Nobody expected that Hill would,
nobody wanted him to and everybody is glad he doesn't.
The American people are too sensitive of their associa
tions not to feel an intimate concern for the character of
the company the President keeps. We are glad Hill
spoke for him.

in the R. M. S. annals."
"Christmas morning at 4 o'clock the
westbound overland with Woods In the
mail car stopped at Rocklin. Wonder
ing whether his little friend was there
the clerk went out to the car door.
Sure enough there she stood.
" 'No, no, â¢ it isn't too late,' replied
Woods. 'You be here to meet me when
I come back and I think there will be
an answer from Santa Claus. Good
night,' and the train started out into
the Sierras.
" 'I was afraid I'd be too late. I ran
out with this letter to Santa Claus. It
won't be too late, will itr eagerly asked
the tot, passing an envelope up to
Woods.
" 'I do want a dolly so badly and
paca is too sick to write to Santa
Claus for me this year.' explained the
anxious child.
"One night late in December the east
bound mail train stopped at Rocklin
to change engines. Woofls stepped to the
mail car door to get a breath of fresh
air, when he was attracted by a piping
cry of 'Mister, oh. mister.' Looking
into the darkness the old man made out
the form of a little girl, the daughter
of a section foreman, whose house was
near the station. Woods bent down,
for the child's head wouldn't near reach
the sill of the car door. The child was
barefooted and shivering' from the cold.
Eviden-tly some strong desire had sent
her out to the train at tnat late hour.
" 'What do you want, little one,'
kindly queried the interested mall clerk.
"I never go out on the Ogden run,"
said a railway mail clerk, "without
thinking of "Old Man* Woods' Santa

Russia has been systematically breaking the spirit of the
Finns and make that province an absolutely passive and
tractable part of the great empire. A national senti
ment and an unbending spirit* do" not comport" "well
with a conquered people who lie upon the frontier, of a
coveted patch of the world's surface.. Making sure their
foothold upon the frontier before taking a grab at the be
yond is the set rule of the Russians. Peter, the greatest
Czar of them all, did exactly the samething in Finland
after the Swedish Charles had lost Pultowa. That the
country north of the Baltic should again see Swede and
Russian in death grapples is well within the bounds of
possibility. . .

STATISTICS FOR DECEMBER
SANTA CRUZ, Jan. 6.â Leo Christal,
a son of Dr. J. F. Christal. left Hono
lulu recently as an attache of the San
ford theatrical company bound for
Australia. Young Christal was for six
weeks employed as bell boy in a Hono
lulu hotel, but; lost his position. He
and his sister, Anita Christal, are heirs
to $200,000 left by their grandfather. A
big sensation was caused a few morons
ago, when the boy was supposed to
have been spirited away from his
father and shipped on a schooner to
Honolulu. * i â
Young Chrlstal Sails for Australia.
It was alleged that the uncle, antici
pating the issuance of a writ of habeas
corpus, had caused the boy to flee to
Honolulu. It was alleged on the other
side that the boy left home of his own
accord because of dislike for his
father. Johnson and his wife were
cited for contempt of the Supreme
Court early in June, 1903.
The dismissal was signed by all of
the Justices with the exception of
Chief Justice Beatty.
R. F. Johnson, Mayor of Monterey,
and hia wife were purged of contempt
by the Supreme Court yesterday in the
matter of the disappearance of Leo
J. Christal. The temporary writ of
habeas corpus secured by Dr. J. F.
Christal, the boy's father, was dis
missed.
Leo Christal left his father's home
in Santa Cruz last February and went
to visit his uncle, Mayor Johnson, at
Monterey. Subsequently he left Mon
terey and went to Honolulu, where he
has since been living with his sister.
The father claimed that the Johnsons
had practically abducted his son and
sought the aid of the courts to have
his child restored to him:

and Wife of Monterey Not
Guilty of Contempt.

The Princess was first married to a
cousin! from whom she was soon di
vorced. She then married Baron von
Pagenhardt, and bore him six children.
The Princess was again divorced and
she allowed the Baron $1250 yearly, she
retaining and educating the children.
Later the Baron's allowance was dis
continued and he proceeded to exercise
certain legal rights and forced a mort
gage of $75,000 on the Princess' estate
near Cassel.
The Princess settled the matter by
resuming payment of the Baron's al
lowance, and he married the daughter
of a millionaire,. Herr Strohmeyer of
Baden-Baden, whereupon the Princess,
whose finances In the meanwTiile had
become involved, again stopped the
Baron's allowance. He protested and
took legal steps to have the Princess
declared a bankrupt, which the court
eventually ordered.

The speaker was presented by Mrs.
George HaJght, the president of the
club, who at the conclusion of the lec
ture extended the thanks of the mem
bers to Mr. Mills for the rare pleasure
he had conferred.
One of the most interesting addresses
heard In clubdom this winter was de
livered yesterday by William H. Mills
before the members and guests of the
Laurel Hall Club. "The Forestry Pol
icy of the United States Government"
was the subject of Mr. Mills' discourse,
which, for fact and fancy, was un
questionably the gem of the year in
clubdom.
During the period of her betrothal,
Mrs. Searles was extensively entertain
ed, and there is every promise of many
post-nuptial functions to be given in
her honor when she returns to town.
The crowning social affair of the
week occurred last night, when Miss
Caroline Ayers, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Grosvenor P. Ayers, became the
bride of Denis Searles. The ceremony'
was performed by the Rev. Dr. Clam
pett, at the home of the bride, to which
only relatives and close friends were
bidden.
A pretty bride was Mrs. Searles,
gov.-ned in her wedding robe of white,
enveloped in billows of filmy tulle. And
a pretty maid was Miss May Ayers,
who assisted her sister at the altar.
This service was rendered for the ,
groom by Frank King, and Isaac Up
ham and Hubert Mee officiated as
ribbon bearers. The drawing-room, ,
where the ceremony took place, was
beautiful in its profusion of pink roses ,
and feathery green; in the bay window
an altar had been erected, from which
rose masses of pink blossoms and
twinkling lights. The bride of last
night will be welcomed by the batch- Â»
elors of the "Hutch" as a charming ac
quisition to their clever coterie, even as
they welcomed Mrs. Augustus Costi
gan, who had lured one of their number
to forsake the ways of bachelorhood,
and incidentally their fireside.
The board of directors will hold a
VheetJng at 4 p. m. to-day at 4S Nevada

John Galen Howard, supervising

new football flejd . on the university
campus, it is settled that the next in
tercollegriate football game will be
played in Berkeley. Permission to. build
the field on the Hillegass tract has been
secured from the Board of Regents and
all that is necessary is the letting of
contracts for the work. The contracts
will' be let by the executive committee
of the Associated Students, the ex
pense of building the field having been
undertaken by the student body. ;
The surveys for the new field j have
just been completed/in accordance with
the plans,' which = a. -field
110x60 yards. This V area is to \ be ? ex
cavated and the material piled around
the-edee of the-, field to make an- em
banlcment. , ." .
: The first cost of the field will be
$20,000. It is intended to excavate only
a portion of the ground and surround
it with a fence. When the whole ; is
excavated >. to . conform v with the 'Â¦' plans
there will be embankments f forty feet

livan Also Workine Hard.
The boxing bouts scheduled for this
month are attracting the interest of
ring-goers. On next Tuesday night
Jim Scanlan and Joe. Millet will battle
twenty-five rounds before the Colma
Athletic Club and on the 19th inst Sam

amateur heavy-weights, will box four
rdunds in Mechanics' Pavilion under
the auspices of the Lincoln Athletic
CJub.
Scanlan is training at Blanken's Six-
Mile House and Eerger visits him every
afternoon and they box six fast rounds.
Millet and Sullivan are training to
cether at the former's resort near
Colma.
Scanlan and Millet are scheduled to
box at 175 pounds. Scanlan recently
returned from Australia, where he won
the heavy-weight championship. Millet
won the championship of Honolulu and
beat the champion of the British navy
in the Hawaiian Islands.
. Monte Attell, brother of clever Abe,
Is to box Jimmy Carroll, son of the ex

battle. Monte is working at the Hayes
Valley Athletic Club and Carroll is
bfling trained by his father at Blan
ken's.
A special train will leave for Colma
at 7:45 o'clock on the night of the fight.
SCAVLAX AND MILLET
TRAINING FOR BATTLE
Young Corbett yielded to Jimmy Britt
and the inevitable yesterday and agreed
to fight the Califoftnian at the weight
proposed by the latter, 130 pounds at
6 o'clock on the day of contest. The
boxers will meet Jn Mechanics' Pavilion
on a day in February yet to be se
lected and Eddie Graney will referee it.
It was announced that the fighters'
share of the purse will be divided 65
per cent to the winner and 25 per cent
to the loser.
When the boxers , parted on Tuesday
night it seemed neither would yield and
that the fight would not take place.
They met by appointment at the Palace
Grill yesterday morning and discussed
the fight in a desultory' fashion at
luncheon, but reached no conclusion.
They met again at Harry Corbett's at
6 o'clock. They retired to a private
room and reappeared in a few minutes
and announced that the match was
made. .
Negotiations must now be opened
with Manager Coffroth of the Yosemite
Club. The latter has been allowing the
boxers 50 per . cent of- the gross re
ceipts in the past, but Britt and Cor
bett apparently expect a better offer
than this. - li?-vÂ£
Corbett received a" substantial bonus
in his fight with Hanlon. Britt con
tends that he is equally as strong a
drawing card as "Corbett and if there
Is a bonus he will expect his share of
it. " The boxers will j surely draw the
record house for men -of -their weight,
some placing the figures as high as
$30,000. This would mean about 510,000
to the winner and $5000 to the loser.
The fight promises to be a great bet
ting affair and already predictions are
made that Corbett will be a slight favo
rite. The measurements of the men
taken before their latest fights show
Corbett is larger than Britt except as
to height and reach. Corbett has filled
out noticeably since be first came to
this coast.
Both boxers will settle down to light
training at once. Corbett at the Beach
Tavern with Tim McGrath. the veteran
trainer in command, and Britt at Ala
meda.
Britt will be at a great disadvan
tage. He will enter the ring at a low
weight and will have no reserve flesh
to lose. .Corbett will, be -slightly above
himself and will have" a leeway of at
least five pounds.

LEMCO SCORES
FOR CORRIGAN
From present indications, the ama
teur boxing game, in this city may soon
pass out of existence.yit has gone so
far within the last' year, or more that
the members of the board of govern
ors of the Pacific â¢Association are be
ginning to look, upon the sport as a
professional pursuit and, therefore, not
worthy to be included within the sphere
of amateur pastimes. Â¦
. At a meeting of the registration com
mittee. Held last evening, Secretary
Herbert Hauser of. the association
wrote' a letter to Supervisor Boxton,
chairman of the police committee of
the,Â»board, calling his attention to the
fact that amateur bouts should all take
place in the arena or clubrooms of
the club under whose auspices the
fights are held and, in strict accordance
with the law, permits should not be
issued to clubs giving exhibitions at
other places. fi
Just what the Supervisors will do in
regard to the matter is yet a question,
but should they decide to carry out the
law to the letter, it will practically
spoil the amateur fighting game in this
city. There is only- one club at the
present time which holds its exhibitions
at its clubrooms, all the others rent
ing the annex to the Mechanics' Pavil
ion for the purpose.
The officers of the Pacific Athletic
Association have been opposed to the
amateur prize fights for a long time,
but they have been powerless to inter
fere. It can safely be said that fully
95, per. cent of all fighters who pose as
amateurs are really out for the coin,
and fight for medals which are re
deemed for a certain sum of money.
A. M. Stone, who is acting for the
amateur association in the Northwest,
reports that several prominent athletic
organizations in that section of the
country are anxious to join the Pacific
Athletic Association and are willing to
come in at a moment's notice. Among
the clubs that are eligible are the Uni
versity of Washington, Pullman Col
lege, Spokane Athletic Club. Seattle
Athletic Club, the Y. M. C. A. and
several smaller institutions.
Much interest is being manifested in
the coming basket-ball tournament,
which will soon be . held in this city.
About eight teams will contest for a
valuable trophy, including the Y. M.
C A.. St. Ignatius College, Occidental
Athletic Club and the University ,of
California.

Eighteen-year-old William Reb
stock's death from a fractured skull
was the subject of one of the inquests
held yesterday by Coroner Leland. The
lad was employed by Tillmann & Ben
del as a helper in their warehouse, at
the â¢ corner of Pacific and Battery'
streets, and on December. 31 while
cleaning a window onthe third story
he fell from the sill to the sidewalk
and received injuries from which he
died on January 2 in the French Hos
pital.:.;;: :Â¦; 'Â¦- y : ':Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦' Â¦ > ' : Â¦
:Â¦>Â¦ The principal witness, Miss N. Wet
terquist, testified that â¢ the boy was
standing on the window sill on -the
outside, -the "being closed,
and that when she went to open
it for the purpose of letting i him
in. she saw, him .roll his eyes' as
though taken with a spell of dizziness
and. immediately fall..
-The Â»1ury returned a verdict .that
death was caused "by, fall from the
third-story window from building on
. the : corner ~_of .:; Pacific and ' Battery
streets, .while. employed by Tillmann &.
Bendel. ; While :: from ;the . evidence we
are:! unable to," accurately determine
the exact manner of the accident, we
feel 1 * that, from the fact of the window
having become completely closed," pre
venting 1 the return 'of the boy, and also
preventing any hold . for hinvfrom his
position on ; the outside" of ; the window,
that "more ; care .should : ; have 'been -ex
ercised to prevent such an aco.idpnt"
Blame for Exposing Him in a
Perilous Position.
They Say That Somebody Was to
' When a rider makes a costly mistake
he is loath to admit it, but Jack Martin
made no bones about acknowledging
that his carelessness or overconfidence,
whichever one chooses to call it, lost
the handicap for Dainty yesterday at
Oakland.
â¢ The race was over one" and a six
teenth miles and was wbrth 5800 to the
winner. Dainty fell heir to 101 pounds
and Walter Jennings and his frienus
unlimbered, the odds dropping from lYz
to 3 to 2 in no time. Faulconbridge _wa>
the only one figured likely to be dan-
At the start Larsen, on the latter
horse, jumped away in the lead, and
his mount was only nodding to the
bpnd for home. There Jack Martin
made his move with Dainty, taking the
lead before Larsen became aware 01
the fact. At the paddock, the Jennings
mare looked a 1 to 10 shot, and Jack
probably thought it would be a shame
to win too far off.
DAINTY- IS EASED UP.
He eased the first choice up just as
J. T. Sheehan, astride our Bessie
working overtime to get up. The iexas
mare responded and Martin quJcWy
discovered his mistake. It wastoolate
though, for . Our Bessie was awarded
the decision by a nose Faulconbridge
finished a length farther "fay. The
time, 1:46, marks an excellent perform
ai Favorites again scored a stand off,
capturing three of. the six events run.
A fetching looking card drew a large
attendance. .;,-_Vi
Sad Sam, the "jungle rattler
equaled the California record^ of
1:12 1-2 for six furlongs, in the second
number. He was ridden by the ap
prentice Sherwood and was a Â» â¢ ,â¢
favorite and won all the way. Martin,
on The Mighty, made a vain, effort -to
catch the half-breed sprinter, finis n |"S
nearly three lengths to the bad at the
wire. The presence of the winner
frightened all out of the race but five.
Harry Stover's big wind-touched
horse, Waterpower, ruled favorite for
the introductory scramble, with a field
of thirteen going to the post. He led
Sir Preston to the paddock, and then,
hoisting distress signals, finished
fourth. Bell brought the 5 to 1 chance,
Our Pride, from behind, winning by a
length. Theron. a 60 to 1 shot, beat Sir
Preston a head fo.r the place. %
MOCORITO BEATS PURE DALE.
Speculators accepted a short price
about Mocorito, favorite for the second
Futurity course sprint. Notwithstand
ing that she carried ,115 pounds, her
odds were pounded down to 9 to 10. In
a wild drive Jack Martin landed the
mare "winner over Pure Dale by half
a length. Romaine, always prominent,
ran a close third.
Rockaway, the Burns and "Water
house crack, with Bell in the saddle,
made it three straight by downing a
shifty field of , three-year-olds . at six
and one-half furlongs. Even money
was the prevailing price against the
colt.
Away from the barrier fifth Bell
gradually worked his way through the
bunch and soon had the pacemaker,
Dr. Rowell, in difficulties. The latter
tired, when Military Man loomed up
as a dangerous customer, the favorite
finally squelching his ambitions in a
head finish. Judge finished fourth, be
hird Dr. Rowel!. Â«
Dell Fountain's Modicum was a siz
zling hot favorite for the last event, a
mile and fifty yard selling affair. The
gelding has uncertain underpinning and
did not finish among me first three.
Avenger, a 90-pounder, and 0Y3 and 6
to 1 in the ring, made a runaway race
of it, reaching the wire more than two
lengths in advance of Marlin. Optimo
was an indifferent third.
XOTES OP'THE TRACK.
Bell was the only rider to pilot two
winners.
While Jack Martin's mistake on
Dainty \Vas a costly one for the mare's
backers Jack is entitled to some credit
for not being there with an apology. He
acknowledged frankly that,* the race
was thrown away.
Two thirds of the gunners who sit on
the fence in the mornings had a bat on
Clarinette to win the first event.
W. Coleman, who rode Teufel, was
extended the courtesies of the grounds
for three days because of breaking
through the barrier. . X .
. After the disgustingly bad showing
made by F. E. Shaw, Jockey John Bull
man was wrathy. Bullman also rode
The Fog and said that he Intended to
lay the matter before the judges. Even
money was obtainable against Sad Sam
because it was thought The Fog might
Â¦ carrv him the first part of the race and
he would "dog" it. The Fog ran as if
his noonday meal had consisted of
homemade' doughnuts, mash,
cannon balls and ocean water. Willie ,
Sink* told Bullman to win as far off as
he could with F. E. Shaw. Bullman'a
sense of wit is not as keen' as it might
be, and he tried to follow out instruc
tions. After running a panel or two
Shaw stopped so suddenly that Bull
man nearly rode himself off the three
year-old's back. The owner of Money j
Muss was suspended because of having
started his horse "short," and it looks
as if an explanation is due in these two
cases mentioned. The odds against
both The Fog and F. E. Shaw went
back in the ring, and It is difficult to
prognosticate what the quotations
would have been if betting had con
tinued.longer.
" . The sr>ecial | train" for the Â¦ city will
leave the track hereafter at 4:10 instead
Of 4:15 o'clock. .
Jockey Frank Otis met with anaccl
dent in the third race that will keep
him out of; the saddle for a time. He
had the mount on Chorus Boy and. just
before the far turn was reached, the
horse anparently crossed his legs and
fell. A* small gash was cut * in the
scalp behind the rider's left ear and
there" was a slight depression of the
skull. He was removed to Fabiola Hos
pital for treatment.

nounced that not even tar and feath

ing was hurriedly called of the men
who had tarred and feathered the
"apostle" two days ago, and *it was
soon announced that the night would
bring forth more drastic penalties for
the bridegroom. MTn were detailed to
watch the Beach residence, where the
Creffields were staying, that the where
abouts of the "apostle" might be known
for certain at the time appointed for
the attack. The Hurts, however, heard
of these plans, and. shortly after dusk
Prank Hurt drove up to the Beach
house in a buggy. Shortly afterward
his sister. Mrs. Creffleld, and an un
known woman climbed into the vehicle,
which drove off" in the direction of Al
bany. Shortly before midnight a party
of twelve armed men surrounded the
Beach house, while others entered and
searched it from top to bottom for the
"apostle." They found only six women.
About'the sameÂ«time Frank Hurt drove
back "and threw a bundle of clothing
into the yard. It is quite certain that

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO, Jan. 6. â Petty thieving,
which, it is alleged, costs the Govern
ment many hundreds of dollars every
year, is said to exist on M:.re Island,
and, as a result, the Government may
be f creed to deprive about 400 men of
the privllece, which they now enjoy, of
traveling to and from t".:e island in
small Loats. The authorities on the
island have been aware for a long time
that petty thefts were occurring, and
they have suggested to the Navy De
partment the employment of a police
force as a remedy. Not long ago G.'W.
White of Colusa, a former employe in
the yard, addressed a letter to Presi
dent. Roosevelt, charging the existence
in Vallejo of a gang of "Forty Thieves"
which annually stole from tie Govern
ment material , to the value of many
hundreds of dollars. Vhrough usual
channels, this document found its
way back to Mare Island, and volum
inous correspondence has resulted. The
charge was also made that the junk
dealers who purchased old cast-off
material from the yard pursue tactics
which would prove sensational if in
vestigated.
It is understood in the yard that the
reply made by the officials there was
to the effect that the latter charge is
unfounded, but that the allegations of
petty thievery, aggregating a large
sum annually, was true. As a remedy,
a police force of twelve men -was sug
gested, to which the department re
plied that no funds were available.
The reply developed the further state
ment from th^ yard that the only alter
native was to take away boat privileges
from about | 400 men. There is a ferry
plying between Vallejo and Mare Island
upon which $2 per month is charged for
monthly commutation tickets. If the
boat privileges were taken awav this
would mean a cost to each one of these
400 men of $24 per y<ear, or $9600 total.
The situation has revived the dis
cussion of the Government establishing
a free ferry between the island and
Vallejo. ' . .
The estate of John P. Harrington is
once .more in the courts. Shortly after
his death his widow, whom he left in
Michigan in 1874. twenty years before
his death, appeared and succeeded in
provine her right to a share of his
property, notwithstanding that she had,
many years after his desertion, believ
ing him dead, contracted a second mar
riage. This marriage was annulled
when she discovered that she was not
a widow at the time it was performed.
Her appearance in court yesterday was
in the nature of. an opposition to the
petition for partial distribution filed
by the Harrington heirs and the filing
of a claim for half the estate, on the
ground that it is community property.

cued, while Temple, after something of
a struggle, was taken to jail. In the
William R. Temple, the latest "Jack
the Hugger," to fall within the notice
of the police, was partly tried before
Judge Mogan yesterday. He is accused
of having entered an office in the Starr
King building, on Geary street, where
he found two pretty young women. One
of them was Miss Marjorie McLennan,
a stenographer in her father's office,
in the Starr King building, who lives
at 1545 Clay street, and the other Miss
May Cordoza, a telephone .operator
living- at 728. Sutter street.
Temple is a rather well-looking fel
low, big and broad, with a pronounced
English accent. According to the testi
mony taken yesterday. Temple, on
Tuesday afternoon, entered the tele
phone exchange of the buildin-. where
Miss Cordoza was in charere. He in
quired for the number of some one's
offlc* and was told there was no such
person in the building. He passed
around behind the counter and threw
an arm around Miss Cordoza's neck.
She struzarled in his embrace and
screamed. Miss McLennan, a stenog
rapher in her father's office p'oining
the telephone exchang- rushed in and
Temple turned his attention to :.er. He
attempted to embrace her and. when
she screamed, he grasped her by her
throat.
J. V. Dougherty, is a sailor in the
service ot the United States navy, who
has tasted the salt spray, and the va
ried booze of many lands for the, last
six years. Not until he struck, the Bar
bary Coast did he ever run afoul Â¦ of
the law. Once there he Imbibed a few
drinks and immediately tried to hide
the moon in his ve3t pocket. Failing
in this, he invaded a lodging-house and
stole a quilt. There was a doubt as to
his intent to be a criminal, and Judge
Mogan dismissed him with a large bun
dle of good advice.. which,' coming from
a seasoned magistrate, seemed almost
fatherly. The sailor promised to store
it in his sea chest and every time he
had shore leavp to overhaul it and re
fresh himself with its salient points.
In his opinion, Judge Morrow held
that a writ of error allowed by a. lower
court from a judgment of contempt^ a

proved, was reviewable by the Circuit
Court of Appeal*, and further found
that the Circuit Courts of Appeals have
jurisdiction under the act of March 3.

peals, to review criminal causes other
than capital, citing several decisions,
including those of the Circuit Court of
Appeals for^the Second Circuit.
In an oral opinion yesterday morn
ing United States Circuit Judge Mor
row denied the motion to set aside the
writ of supersedeas heretofore issued
by him in the case of the Butte and
Boston Consolidated Mining Company
vs. . F. Augustus Heinze, Montana Ore
Purchasing Company and others.
The petition foe a writ of supersedeas
was filed in the Circuit Court of Ap
peals on December 31, 1903, the object
of which was to stay the execution
of a judgment ' against F. Augustus
Heinze, Josiah H. Trerise and Alfred
Frank, for an alleged violation of a
contempt of the United States Circuit
Court for the District of Montana, the
contempt consisting in the refusal on

an inspection and examination and sur

valuable mining property in the State
of Montana.- â¢
j Upon the petition of the parties found
guilty of contempt United- States Cir
cuit Judge Morrow,, on the date men

judgment of the Circuit Court until
February 8.' Whereupon a motion was
filed . seeking to set aside the writ 'of

questions: -'How much money have you

It was Â¦ at this â¢â¢â¢. juncture that Selby
attempted V to â¢ voice his bitterness
against' the woman t~ whom he - was
The unhappy husband then en
deavored to j prove that his wife had
been guilty of censurable conduct with
o. man named Waters arid with DonaM
McKae, the furniture man who owned
the lodging-house .conducted by her,
but the court refused to allow him to
proceed, ordering him to confine him
self) to his efforts to refute the charge
that he was a neglectful spouse. Â».
Mrs. Selby was followed on the\vit
ness stand by Mrs. Donald McRae, wife
of the furniture man, .who is accused
by Selby of alienating his wife's affec
tions. She said *she had known Mrs.
Selby, for the last three years and that
she*was a most estimable woman. Dur
ing all that time, said -Mrs. McRae,
Mrs. Selby had earned her own living
and that of her three children.
Her testimony closed the case of Mrs.
Selby and the court called for the de
fense. Selby, shaking and nervous, ex
plained that he had no ; evidence to
offer, that he had summoned witnesses,
but that they had all refused v to ap
pear in his behalf. He said that in lieu
of witnesses he would like to read a
statement. "Permission 'to do so was
granted him, and he walked up to the
Witness chair.- ,
"Raise your right hand and be
sworn, Mr. Selby," said the court.
â¢ ;""1 affirm, sir," replied the minister. ,
Selby then tried to show that he had
met with reverses and informed the
court that the law of divorce. provided
that where it was shown that a hus
band had been a faithful provider for
yeaÂ«s, and then met with misfortune,
it became the duty of the wife to sup
port him.
SIRS. McRAE TESTIFIES.
"You certainly cannot have forgotten,
Mr. Selby, that you got all of it back
the first week after your arrival here?"
Witness and counsel, otherwise hus
band and wife, then entered into an ar
gument as to the amount of money
each had contributed to the "family
fund. The argument only served to
excite Selby to a painful degree and
make more apparent the remarkable
coolness of his wife. It - ended only
when Judge Hebbard announced that
he. would not allow it to proceed any
farther.
The preacher presented a pitiful spec
tacle ,during*,the progress of^he'vtria!'
of the divorce action. He was his own
attorney, and in his Â¦ efforts ' to "prove
that he was not guilty of the 'charge;, of
failing to provide for his wife" and
ily. he made almost a' f aide puttie; trial.
He , endeavored â¢ to introduce â¢ evidence
foreign to the suit. ' Were it no* for
the -fact that during the proceedings
he sobbed and cried repeatedly, partic
ularly after a. reference to the happi
ness he and his wife enjoyed during the
early days of their married life, it
would have been ludicrous. His emo
tion did not, however, affect his wife,
who bore his cross-examination with
out a sign of .nervousness. Neither did
it affect his pretty little daughter, who
sat in the courtroom during the trial.
She smiled occasionally and almost
laughed at times when their father's
woeful ignorance of the law led him to
make a blunder that called forth a
few words of caution from the Judge
or an objection from her mother's at
torney. His tears and sobs did not af
fect her near as much as did his piti
able attempts to show that he is a
wronged man.
Dark, plump and close to 40 is Mrs.
Selby. When she appeared " in court
she was attired in a tight-fitting, light
blue gown, a long string of beads was
around her neck ! and a black picture
hat, the somberness of which was re
lieved by a bit of bright red ribbon,
was her headgear. She testified that
she was married to Selby eighteen
years ago in Australia and that a few
years since she came to this country
with- him. They remained here for a
few years,,; and then he returned to
Australia,^where he is pretty well, con
nected. She remained behind, and to
support herself embarked in the lodg
ing-house business. Occasionally, she
said, her husband sent her jj some
money, but his remittances were not
regular. He finally came back here,
but she refused to live with him.

It" was when Selby began cross-ex
amining his wife that he broke down
and sobbed. He got so nervous that
it was with great difficulty that he was
able to hold in his hand the letters he
was endeavoring to read in evidence.
"Why was it, Mrs. Selby," he tear
fully said, "that when I first came to
this country and went to your room
ing-house and asked you for a room
you refused to give me one and
told me you had one for me in another
house?"
"Because I did not want you," said
his wife. -.-.
Selby then endeavored to show that
he had very frequently sent money to
his wife. â¢ She admitted to having re
ceived some of it and then. said to him:
A PITIFUL SIGHT.
"I will not listen to your remarks,"
said the court. "Thev are not . suit

Selby persisted in denouncing Mrs.
Selby as an unfaithful wife and the
Judge ordered him to take his seat. "I

Richards made a statement to the
police that he came here from Visalia
the night before Christmas with $100
in his pocket to have a good time. He
had been living at 771 Howard street.
He had spent all his money except
$24 50, which he had in his pocket
when searched. He said he had never
been in Martini's saloon before, did not
know the man and had no grudge
against him. The only reason he shot
was because Martini was coming to
ward him, although he admitted he did
not see a club or revolver in Martini's
hand. He said he had been drinking
very hard ever since Â¦ arriving in the
city and at times did not know what
he was doing. The police say he- was
under the influence of liquor, but knew
the consequences of his acts.
In Richards' pocket was found a let
ter from his brother, Bert Richards of
Salem, Mass. The writer said he had
heard that the wayward brother had
had some trouble with his wife. The
letter urged the transgressor to keep
away from drink and lead a good life.
His brother said he was praying for
Edward all the time and exhorted him
to join the church.
VISALIA. Jan. 6.â Edward Richards
left this city on the 19th day of De
cember to spend the holidays in San
Francisco. He was employed in the
livery stable of Matt McGovern. He
was generally regarded as a pretty de
cent fellow, except when under the in
fluence of liquor. He was 23 years old
on December 20, 1903, and was born in
Yreka. He has traveled all over the
country as a jockey and has lived in
Visalia about five years of his life. His
mother and two sisters live here. He
was recently divorced from his wife.
Martini was sfnt to the Harbor
Emergency Hospital, where Dr. J. D.
Murphy expressed the opinion that
there was no hope of his recovery, for
the bullet had penetrated the brain.
Martini died four hours later without
regaining consciousness. Richards had
been taken to the City Prison, and
when Martini died a murder charge
was placed against his name.
ADMITS THE SHOOTING.
Richards ran to the rear of the saloon
and Martini's wife, who was present,
tried to intercept him and then ran to
the front door and shouted for help.
Corporal Fraher and Policemen Holmes
and Skain heard the shot and the wo
man's cry for help and they ran to the
saloon. Just as they entered Richards
returned from the rear of the saloon,
as the door was locked, and he had the
revolver in his hand.
"There's the man who shot my hus
band." said Mrs. Martini. He did not
deny the shooting, but claimed that he
had acted in self-defense, as the saloon
keeper was advancing toward him
when he pulled out his revolver and
fired. The weapon was taken from him
and an empty shell was found, the
other chambers being loaded.
TRIES TO ESCAPE.
"No."
"Well." said Martini as he took
Bold of Richards' arm, "get out of
here."
Richards rose to his feet and pulling
a revolver out of his pocket fired a
shot at Martini. The bullet struck
Martini over the left eye and he fell to
the floor with a groan.
Richards met Victoria Angels, a Mex
ican woman, in a dance hall, and about
3 o'clock went into the Oasis saloon
with her. He ordered a bottle of beer,
and after It was consumed he "ordered
another. He did not pay for the beer
and Martini went to where he was sit
ting with the woman and asked him if
ha was going to pay. Richards ap
peared to be in an ugly humor and said
Joseph Martini, proprietor of the
Oasis saloon at C23 Pacific street, was
shot and killed early yesterday morning
in the presence of his wife by Edward
Richards, a stableman from Visalia,
who has been spending the holiday sea
son in this city.
The petition of Mrs. Schmitz. mother
of the Mayor, that new sidewalks be
laid on Greenwich street, between
Gough and Octavia, was taken under
advisement. A majority protest was
filed against the improvement..
The board recommended the expe
diency of constructing sewers on
Twenty-gixth avenue, between Califor
nia and Lake streets, and on California
street, between Twenty-fourth and
Twenty-sixth avenues.
The board sustained the protest of
property owners against the laying of
artificial stone sidewalks on First ave
nue, between Washington and Jackson
streets. The protestants favored the
laying of sidewalks six feet in width.
Chief of the Fire Department Sulli
van notified the board that the auto
matic sprinkler in the Chutes Theater
did not comply with the ordinance and
Commissioner Schmitz was detailed to
make an investigation.
The Board of , Public Works yester
day decided to recommend to the Board
Â« Supervisors that provision be made
m the next municipal budget for the
widening and repaving of the roadway
or Mission street, between East and
by eight feet. This will necessi
tate the reduction of the width of side
walks on both 6ides of the street by
four feet, an ordinance reducing their
"width from 19 feet to 15 feet having
already been passed.
The board took action as the result
Â°' a petition filed by property owners
owning more than 60 per cent of the to
tal frontage requesting that the street
Tu" idened to facI11 tatÂ« teaming traffic.
The .board not only approved the
widening of the street, but favored the
repaving from Steuart street to Ninth.
The petitioners asked that some practi
cal pavement be adopted for the street
ana the board agreed that the pave
ment rut down on Third street is the
best for the heavy traffic on Mission
street. City Engineer Grunsky roughly
estimates the cost of the work at $125.

It was a little-family row that caused

last week he issued a ukase to her to
prepare him a hot foot bath. The tem
perature of the water was nearly a
quarter of a degree higher than he had
expected, so he began to beat her. The
defendant was standing at the cigar
counter and, hearing the screams of his
sister, rushed to her rescue. He weighs
about two ounces lighter than a Pana
ma hat and apparently couldn't cut a
string of spaghetti with a Damascus
sword. He was valiant, however, and
tackled his big brother-in-law. Dur
ing the scuffle Kaufman was stuck
slightly in the wrist by a penknife. ..
The courtroom looked like a depot for
Kishenev refugees, all of whom were
anxious to testify on behalf of the de
fendant, but Judge Cabaniss thought
the case was a short, horse that could'
be curried soon. Prosecutor Hanley. co-
incided with alacrity, and Eskovitch
headed a triumphant procession out of
the courtroom, while Kaufman followed
dejectedly in the rear..',: â¢'. ..

prison yesterday he said he was an
agent for books and in the employ of
Collier Publishing Company. He at
tributed his trouble to an over-indul
gence in liquor. Judge Mogan increased
Temple'8, bail from $20 to $200 and, as
the defendant was unable to furnish
the amount, he spent the day and last
night in the city prison.
- .v'eary from plodding the burning
sands of the desert, a party of Mystic
Shriners found an oasis Tuesday night
in a saloon on the corner of Grant
avenue and O'Farrell street. Here they
rested pleasantly, quenching their
thirsts with yem-yem, which, infidels
call champagne, and discussing the
merits of camels and caravans. ,-Â¦' <
Suddenly the peace of the night was
broken. Two bashi bazouks, terrors to
all travelers on the desert, v came
through the sands to the oasis. They
looked like two ordinary American sol
diers and the keeper of the spring did
not want them around.â "Give us a
drink," .aid the soldiers. "On your
way," said the keeper. "This isn't the
headquarters of the Associated . Char
ities. Fui! Blow through yonder
swinging doors."
After many words had passed, the
bashi bazouks drew scimiters and,\vith
drew to the main trail, which is known
as Grant avenue, where they guarded
the entrance to the oasis and loudly
proclaimed their intention of slitting
open everybody as a woman would
cut a gourd. The Mystic Shriners "held
on to the rope,*" whicttsat this particular
spring is known as a' "bar rail" â all
save one. He is known to traders as
Tom Trebel, and. is president of the
Western Brass Works. He knew a side
â¢trail that led to a main highway called
O'Farrell street. Through this he went
and found Sheik Policeman Jim Pearl,
to whom he told the perilous condition
of himself and his comrades. Policeman
Pearl gathered the bashi bazouks into
custody and had them conveyed ' to a
fortress known as the city prison.
Yesterday the two bloodthirsty bashi
bazouks, who gave the names of Fred
H. Hlekman and Robert V/alker of the
Tenth Infantry of Uncle Sam, came
before Caliph Fritz to be judged. Trebel
testified to their utter misconduct and
Policeman Pearl verified his state
ments. TLi soldiers made faint de
fense, alleging: only that they feared
the crowd in the saloon was going to
attack them. They could not explain
their waiting with open knives outside
the doors and were promptly found
guilty of a serious disturbance of the
peace. Their punishment will be de
termined to-day.

cargo includes 3000 tons of flour. 250 barrels of
alcohol 700 tons of nitrate of soda and 1200
bales of cotton. The cargo is smaller than

The question of the tenantcy of the news
stands at the ferry depot did not come up
vesterday at the meeting of the State Board
of Harbor Commissioners owing to the absence
of CommisEioner Klrkpatrlck. Wellman. Peck
& Co. applied to the commission for a npur
track from the belt railroad to their new build
ing on East street. The matter was placed on
file for future action. Donald de Villamil Gra
ham is now a full-blown wharfinger, his bond
having- been filed and accepted. Although
classed on the payroll as a wharfinger, his bond
duties will not take him near tho water and
he will not b*' required to wear a uniform. Ills
activity will be confined to one of the clerical
departments !n the secretary's office.

Shipping Intelligence.
ARRIVED
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner Mariposa, which sailed yesterday
for Tahiti, carried among her passen
gers four scientists, the success of
whose mission in the tropics will mean
much for the native inhabitants of the
South Sea Islands. Death in myste
rious forms has been busy o-f recent
years among the dusky people of these
fair lands and its annual harvest has
grown to proportions that have alarm
ed the French Government, of which
many of the victims are wards.
Dr3. Lonvan, Cassian, Grcsfilley and
Nicholas Senn, who sailed for Tahiti
on the Mariposa, are in the service trf
the French Government. Each was se
lected for his fitness for the work, and
between them they hope to discover
the reason for the native mortality and
adequate means to fight it. To each
medico has been assigned a district in
which he will hold judicial sway. Un
der the guidance of the scientists the
natives will be taught the blessings of
hygienic living. Victims of the pecu
liar diseases from which European resi
dents are immune, but which pile up
the native death rate, will be isolated
and treated while the Government spe
cialists make a study of the trouble.
The word of the doctors will be law
and they will have all the legal ma
chinery of the colony at their disposal
in carrying out their plans. Under the
new system the French Government
hopes to restore the people of these
trc-pic dependencies to their original
sturdy health.
The Mariposa carried a large cargo,
and her passengers included the fol
lowing named: S. Lambert. Charles
Voria, Mrs. L. W. Robinson, Mrs. J.
C. Van Amringe, Dr. Lonvan, Dr. Cas
sian, Dr. Grosfllley, -Dr. Nicholas Senn,
Mrs. H. Menel, Miss Menel and N. Me
nel.
'. Mrs. Benson said:
i The new year opens auspiciously In respect
I of AmcrWnn trade, althouch there are many
j jrrave exceptions to the rule The short cotton
1 <rop has necessitated the closing of mills in
1 the Sot;th and Xew Enstend. throwing thou
sands of tvomeii and men out cf employment.
', Again there is th* absorption of exeat nat
' ural oroduots by a few men to the detriment
of the whole nation, the two most glaring in
stances beinjr the steel corporation of Morgan.
Carnegie & Co., owning through the Iniquitous
! power of money 75 :ier cent of the ore mines
! in the !-ake Superior resion, 72,000 acres of
' eeil landP, 18.5<HÂ» <?oke evens and 125 lake vts
i s<?!s: and the Standard Oil Company, with a
! marital etook of $97.000.000 â a coniDany which
controls petroleum refineries In all of the prin
cipal Northern cities and prcducew 70 per cent
of the total output of refined oil In America,
i Another natural product â ccal â is practically
' controlled by tlÂ»Â« MorEan-Vand*rbiU Erouo of
railways. In spita of these conditions la a
j free country the natural resources are not yet
a!! absorbed by the few, and the results of our
general trade and commerce are surprisingly
large.
As we have been leading the world in manu
factures for fome time, the outlook is re
assurinjj if our peoule can avoid entangling
alliances with foreign governments and can
find statesmen with suftlcient ability to con
trol the discordant portions of the labor union,
as well as the tendency of the laboring classes
to manipulate political affairs* and even legis
lation itself.
The fair picture of the new year is net
without its deep shadows. We sigh as we re
flect that the clouds of war take their shape
and density from the wicked ambitions and
cruel telftshnesa of politicians and rulers. In
the Far l.ast ominous slsns point to war be
tween two nations that selfishly covet their
neighbors' soods.
Mrs. Benson, after dealing with mat
ters pertaining to Colombia and the
isthmus, devoted herself to the subject
"Polygamy in Utah and Mexico," ask
ing whether polygamy was still prac
ticed in Utah by the Mormons.
Mrs. Benson said:
The question has been asked many times by
Americans since the polygamlst Roberts was
elected to Concress, but has not been satis
factorily answered. It now comes up again
because an officer oT the Mormon church. At
torney Keed Smoot, has been elected to the
United States Senate.
ThTe' is e Etronp conviction entertained by
the best clam of citizens that no "Latter-day
faint" 6hould be permitted in the halls of
Congress, and pressure is being broucht to
have a law passed to prevent a periodical
Etrugsl* to keep Mormons from actine in a
legiplative capacity, either in the State or
national !Â»eisiatureE. The oath administered
by thÂ» Mormon church being more binding
upon Mormons than any caths of allegiance to
thÂ» United States they might take. It is
against nub'.ic policy to yield them Congres
sional or legislative honors.
Mrs. C. E. Grunsky presided and in
troduced Mrs. Benson, who, remem
bered for her powerful course of ad
dresses last year, received a flattering
reception from the very large audience.
"Polygamy in Utah and Mexico," and
"Socialism and Its Present Outlook"
and labor dissensions were subjects
pungently treated by Mra. Louise Ben
son before the Channing Auxiliary in
the hall of the First Unitarian Church
yesterday morning.

CHICAGO, Jan. 6. â War news ruled the
wheat market to-day. Reawakened fear of
hoatllitlci in the Far East caused an excited
opening, and prices were much higher. Shorts
were extremely anxious to cover and there
was also a good demand from commission
houses. No one seemed wllllm? to sell, while
buying orders. appeared to come from all sides.
The opening price on May changed between
87%c and 88%c, a gain of 1%Â©1%c to 2%Â«Â«
2%c over vtsterdey's closing figures. July
also showed a big: advance, opening %c to 2Ho
higher, at Me to 83 Y*c. The Immediate cause
of the ursent demand was a decline in the
price of English consols, indicating that the
war situation wa3 regarded as. most critical.
To add emphasis to the factors, the cables
were higher. Receipts also light, not
withstanding the fact that weather conditions'
were fa\'orable for the free movement of the
crop. On the 2%c advance in May there was
general, profit-taking, and tho market settled
back. May receding to 87% c. although the
sentiment still remained bullish. A cable dis
patch from Paris stating that speculators were
purchasing large quantities of wheat on rumors
that a crash had occurred in Korea started
another active buying movement later in the
day. and prices again advanced. May again
touching tho 88&e mark. .The demand con
tinued excellent throughout the remainder of
the sessicn. There were slight recessions from
the high point, Â¦ but anything in the line of
war news would always result -in an- advance.
Closing prices were near the top. J^ay being

NEW YQRK. Jan. 6 There- was. -a. 'rathar
\iolent fall in prices of stocks to-day under
the joint ir.r.uence of a recrudescence of the
war scare and the poor quarterly report of the
earnings vt tin- United Sta.tes Steel Corpora
tion. The war scare was the dominating in
fluence late in the day, not only In the etock,
but in aii <he speculative markets. The grain
markets jumped and the cotton market. broke
<jh the commonly accepted view that the out-.
brÂ«?ak of war between Russia and Japan 'would
awaken an active demand fdr cereals to bVex
porttd from our Pacific Coast ports,- while- the
inteniiption of the Chinese cotton trade would
affect that staple. Whatever inconsistencies
ihtre may be in this view, .they were not of
dissuasive influence upon i..e â¢epfeZulatlve "ac
tivity at prortselonal traders" wbo -hehl-'tt..-- The
Pacific railroads were also conspicuously . tackl
ing: in any btneflt from- the expected increase
In the Pacific export trade In grains; and>were.
in fait, among the weakest stocks Jn the list,
scoring lecs<-s of between 3 colnls'on
the day. A few of the- coolers. Soutbem'rall
roads and M>ecialtleÂ» came..wltbin an. equal
range of losses, but that range rather exceeded?*
the average of- the day's looses. W '. jv . " Â¦"Â¦ Â¦
T^e beaviiist pree^ure jdevelOMd .after the
Lpndpa market had ctaÂ«ed. trading (or the day.
although that market was a. tree seller here
during its trading hours, .and the action -of^
IlusMan an-' British government , bonds in
London and Paris was accepted as. corrobora*
tory of the fc-aia of war.' Â¦ Added to these
features of inconsistency in the day's 'move
ments the fact that the late report of the
outbreak of actual hostilities was alleged to
have come o\er cur new Pacific cable to San
Francisco from an Asiatic terminus, and some
warrant is found for the suspicion of consid
erable btax activity in the day;Â» market do
ings.
It waÂ» worthy of remark that United States
St.-el preferred, was not among the weaker
stocks, although *he troubles of the Steel Cor
poration were supposed to be occaslpn fox
much of the day's weakness. . The extreme
decline In United States Steel preferred was
l T iÂ« and its net loss was 11^. The stock
showed *r>od J>ower of resistance to the early
general depression after the first downward
plunge.. Opinion varied. as to whither the buy
ing of the stock was for purposea of Support
or for purposes of accumulation on the ground
that the r-oor showing in yesterday's state
ment the low .level of ithe de
pression with' prospect of ' -Improvement'- from
this time onward. The. common stock was
without many friends and drifted downward
to a new low record " of 9%. ~
The rcce-nt active- n>ecÂ«Iation continued in
Amalgamated Copper and it made temporary
ehow of utrength, but yielded in the late gen
eral break with a sharp rebound at. the- last
on short covering. . . ' .' Â¦ ". â¢ Â¦
The Â¦ failure â¢Â»< the easine money market tt)
attract any outside demand frr either stocks
1 or bend* has had as much effect on specula
tive sentiment as the Far Eastern news and
leaves the holdlnts of buyers, of last month
who hoped for a January ris? in a condition
vulnerable to bear attacks. The market closed
rather unsteady at a rally.
Bonds were quiet and easy. T'tal sales,

A force of experienced men has
been selected by County Clerk-elect
John J. Greif to fill the positions in his
office during the next two years. The
names of the successful ones were
made public, last night while they
were all assembled in Judge Sloss'
courtroom, where they had been sum
moned by Greif to hear the news of
their appointment and to receive in
structions from their chief. The list
contains the names of many men fa
miliar to politicians. There is not a
man on the list, however, who cannot
fill any, of the desks in the County
Clerk's office; in fact, most of them
have had experience in the office.' :
In naming .the 'men Greif talked to
them as would a- man with . a large
business dependent upon his help and
when he was through they all stepped
forward and signed an ironclad agree
ment to, obey orders to the letter, and
to do everything in, their power to* see
that the County Clerk's office would'in
the future be a marvel of neatness and
an office against "which not a* word of

PEOPLE IX PARTY.
Mr. Cunningham got off the train at
Sacramento to see the sights and on
his return he saw Patti's private car
disappearing over the bridge. He tele
graphed Julius Francke, another of the
party, to look after his belongings, as
he would rejoin the party in this city.
At Sacramento representatives of the
press sought vainly for a chance to
talk to the Baroness, but she courte
ously declined. The overland arrived
at the- Oakland pier in time to catch
the ferry-boat which was laden with
racetrack goers. Madame Patti at
tracted a great deal of attention as
she left the car on the arm of her hus
band, Baron Cederstrom, and her agent,
Marcus Mayer. She entered a waiting
carriage and was driven on board the
ferry-boat.
Patti went immediately to the Palace
and retired to her apartments for rest
after her fatiguing journey. She seem
ed to be in excellent health and pleased
to have reached the city by the Gclden
Gate.
The dLva is accompanied by her hus
band, Mrs. Baird of London, a lifelong
friend of the singer and her guest: Miss
Karolyn Burmeistcr, ner companion,
who has been with her for thirty years,
and Signor Morini, her secretary. â¢
In the company who will appear to
night are Signor R. Saplo, the musical
director, who was here with Patti in
1890, and who has played her accom
paniments in her concert work; Miss
Mera Margolles. pianist; Miss Rose Za-^
meles, violinist; Claud Cunningham;
barytone; Wilfred Vrigo, tenor, and An
tone Hegner.
Baroness Cederstrom, better known
to theatergoers as Adelina Patti, ar
rived in this city last evening and, with
her husband and members of her party,
is quartered at the Palace Hotel. The
famous singer has been religiously
guarded by the Baron and her secre
tary and no one has been permitted to
interview her. Even while en route
from Salt Lake City the diva remained
in her private. car and declined to hold
converse with strangers. Her whole
desire was to save her strength for her
reappearance in San Francisco to-night.
She has not been here before since 1890.
When she steps before the footlights
at the Grand Opera-house to-night the
famous singer will be royally greeted
by a. large audience, composed of the
best people of this city and vicinity.
On last Monday night the diva had
the great honor of singing in the Mor
mon Tabernacle in Salt Lake City. Im
mediately after the concert she was
bundled up and went immediately to
her private car and the journey west

PRINCIPAL SHIPMENTS.
Some remarkable revelations concern
ing the relative share that San Fran
cisco is taking, in the transaction of
business between the mainland of the
United States and the non-contiguous
territory of the United States are found
in governmental statistics gathered un
der the law of April- 29, 1902, which are
now for the first time available. The
non-contiguous territory of the United
States includes the Philippines, Alaska.
Porto Rico, Hawaii and some lesser
islands. The point of interest in the
figures is the indication of. how the
business of the countries bordering on
the Pacific Ocean arid under the con
trol, of the United States is transacted.
The first fact for observation is that
the Puget Sound cities are gaining
strongly, in the race for the business of
Alaska and the Philippines. The cus
toms returns just at hand show that
the Pacific Coast shipments to Alaska
have increased since 1868 from 5253,000
to J13.457.000 in 1901. During the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1903, the value of
shipments from the Pacific. Coast to
Alaska amounted to $9,266,504. Of this
amount Puget Sound sent out $6,138,089,
San Francisco $2,955,341 arid Portland
and Astoria $173,124.
The value of shipments of all goods
from the United States to the Philip
pine Islands during the nine months
ending September 30, 1903, was '$3,309,
427, as compared with $3,61S,712 for the
corresponding period in 1902. The fol
low.lng table is provided to show how
the export business to the Philippines
from this coast is distributed, Â¦ the
figures representing the values moved
from each of the places named during
the nine months ending on September
30 in 1902 and 1903: .

The figures from official sources have
just been received by Eugene Goodwin,
director of the Pacific Commercial
Museum, and he is making a compila
tion for a bulletin to be issued for the
benefit of the business community.
Concerning the falling. off in exports
from San' Francisco and Portland to
the Philippines in 1903 Mr. Goodwin
says that it may be. accounted for in
pact' by the establishment of direct
steamship service between! Seattle and
Manila and the large shipments of lum
ber and forage from Seattle. The values
of such shipments 4 during the nine
months ending last September were
as follows:, Oats. $137,815; hay, $166,
692; lumber, $440,683. The significant
fact Is that the Puget. Sound ports are
increasing their exports not only, to
Alaska but also to the Orient at the
expense of San Francisco.

The audience was then entertained
with a whirlwind dance by Irene Koper
and Ruth Wilson, who gave a most
wonderful exhibit of rapid dancing.
Then* the orchestra played a march
dedicated to the head consul, after
which "Prince" Vincent, on behalf of
the Woodmen of California Camp, pre
sented, the head consul a ' beautiful
silver loving cup, a token of. esteem
from the host camp. Mr. Falkenburg,
who had been deeply moved by the ap
preciation shown for his invalid wife,
was for a moment almost lost for
words to express his feelings at this
further token from the , camp. ' As
soon as he recovered himself he
thanked the members of California No.
634 and the ladies of California Circle,
after which he delivered' an entertain-,
ing and Instructive address. The Bo
hemian Quartet.' E. Wright. A.
Mayce, C. Sheehan and C. Hanke,
favored with vocal selections, after
which there was dancing for two hours.
More than five hundred people were
turned away from the hall, as there
was no room for them.
At the close of her remarks Mrs.
Oliver, on behalf of the Women of
Woodcraft of California Circle, â¢ pre
sented to Miss Falkenburg for her
mother a -handsome cologne bottle in
cased in 4 silver, and while the young
lady was responding about one hun
dred and fifty ladies of the circle ad
vanced to the stage and each threw
upon It a bouquet of beautiful flowers,
a token of love and affection for the
past guardian neighbor, who could not
be present. (
This was followed with an overture
by. an orchestra and a few>words of
introduction by Chairman Wilson, who
expressed the feeling of" admiration
that there Is in California Camp for
"the grand old man of Woodcraft, Its
founder." After that there was a so
prano solo by Miss Gertrude Gallick.
a monologue by Isadore B. Myers and
a bass solo by J. J; Colgan. a member
Cf the camp. This was followed by
the presentation of a set of beautifully
engrossed resolutions by Leo de Car
dona. P. C. C. to Laurance Vincent in
recognition of the energetic and active
work he has done for. the camp of
which he is a charter member. The
recipient, who is generally known in
the fraternal circles as "the prince," re
sponded with that decree of modesty
for which he is noted.
Then Fred Purdy. the sweet singer
of the National Union, sang a tenor
solo, after which Mrs. -Hester Bell
Oliver, past guardian neighbor of
Woodcraft, delivered an interesting
address on Woodcraft, during which
she spoke of the good work done for
that order by Mrs. Falkenburg, wife
of the head consul, while she was its
grand guardian neighbor. That lady
could not be present, being an invalid
in Oakland.- but was represented by
her daughter. ?
MAKE PRESENTATION.
MUSIC FOLLOWS ARRIVAI*.
If ever Head Consul F. A. Falken
burg of the Woodmen of the World felt
honored by neighbors of Woodcraft it
must have been In Lyric Hall last night
at the reception tendered him by Cali
fornia Camp No. 634, W. O. W.
Previously to the reception the head
consul and his daughter were the spe
cial guests of a number of personal'
friends at a dinner, served in a popu
lar and fashionable dining hall on Lar
kin street. Those who were at that
affair besides the guests were: Joseph
A. "Wilson, . past consul commander of
California Camp, who was the chair
man of the evening at the reception;
Mrs. Wilson", Laurance and Mrs. Vin
cent, E. B. McManus and wife, C.
Welley and wife, D. L. Mayers and
wife, D. Oliver Jr.. editor of the Pa
cific Woodman, and Mrs. Oliver; C.
Goldberg and wife, G. W. Baltic and
wife, and Leo de Cardona and lady.
After the supper the guests were
driven to- Lyric Hall, and In company
with the chairman of the evening, Jo
seph A. Wilson, were received by the
following named members of the com
mittee of arrangements: Laurance
Vincent, Leo de Cardona. G. W. Baltic,
Charles Goldberg and D. L. Mayers and
the uniformed teams of Golden Gate
and Mission camps. He was escorted
Into the beautifully decorated hall, in
which were assembled about a thou
sand people, neighbors of Woodcraft,
members of the Women of Woodcraft
Â»nd many who do not belong to either
organization. The advance of the guest
of the evening was the signal for a
burst of applause that shook the build
ing as did the concussion of the great
guns that were fired during the fore
noon, and the applause and the shouts
of "Hurrah for Falky!" were kept up
until the head consul and his daughter
reached the scatÂ£ reserved for them
on the stage. Both the head consul
and Miss. Falkenburg bowed their ac
knowledgment of appreciation of the
ovation.
Should Dr. Brackett not be placed on
the Health Board he will be considered
along with Dr. J. H. Dlllnn and Dr. I).
F. Ragan for Health Officer. The buc-.
ctBPful two of the three named would
then be placated by appointment as
chief emergency surgeon, to succeed
Dr. Bunnell, and City Physician, to suc
ceed I5r. Morrissey. Dr. T. A. Rottanzl
Is also an aspirant for one of the latter
two positions and is being considered
by the Mayor for appointment. â¢
SI Gunst, brother of Moses Gunst,
has been appointed expert searcher by
Tax Collector Smith j to succeed Her
man -Bnkel, who recently died. ThÂ«
position was originally created by
ordinance of the Board of Supervisors,
on the. recommendation of the Mayor,
and pays a salary of $150 a month. It
is under civil service, but no examina
tion has as vet been held for it.
The vacancy created by the death of
Dr. Stahle will be filled by the appoint
ment of William C. Gray, who stands
next in line on the list of experienced
clerks.
Board of Healthâ Dr. G. F. Brackett,
D ( r. Miles Van Meter, Dr. F. C. New

HEALTH BOARD VACANCIES.
It is almost certain that Mayor
Schmitz will name three members of
the Board of Health, although the
terms of Buckley and Baum alone ex
pire, Lewitt having still one more year
to serve. Lewitt has frequently ex
pressed his determination to resign as
soon as his two colleagues retire, he
preferring'- not to remain on a
board the new members of which
will be antagonistic to him. Should
Lewitt not resign the Mayor may con
sider him as having been removed un
der the recent Supreme Court decision*
that the' Mayor has the power of re
moval at will. Lewit was removed by
Schmitz along with the other mem
bers of Phelan's Board of Health, who
retained their offices by reason of an
injunction restraining Schmitz "from
removing them. The Supreme Court
decision referred to makes it possible
for Schmitz to remove JLewitt again
and to appoint his successor. â¢ Lewitt
himself says that he dors not know
whether he will resign or riot and that
his prospective removal does not
bother him.
Mayor Schmitz is having some
trouble in" selecting the members of
the Health Board. He would like to
reappolnt Dr. Miles Van Meter, whom
he appointed in 1902, when he at
tempted to remove the old board. Dr.
Ward, who was appointed on the
board at the same time by Schmitz, is
averse to having Van Meter as a col
league for some reason. Ward and
the Mayor have had some warm de
bates over the matter, but it is likely
that the Mayor's intention to appoint
Van Meter will be carried out. The
second vacancy on the Health Board
probably will be filled by the.appoint
ment of Dr. C. F. Brackett, a close
friend of the Mayor. Dr. Frank C.
Newton is also under consideration for
one of the vacancies on the Health
Board.
PRosPEcrrrrc appointees.- ,
The Mayor believes that the provi
sion is unconstitutional, In that It is
discriminatory and is a disfranchise
ment not legally warranted. Still he.
hesitates to appoint Boyle, much as he
would. like to, fearing complications ofr
a serious nature.
Boyle also thinks the provision Is
unconstitutional and ascertained on
inquiry that the charter" framers al
lowed it to slip through in the hurry
incident to the preparation of the or
ganic law. Boyle assured the Mayor
yesterday that, he is willing to take
chances of some one initiating proceed
ing to have the matter settled by the
courts by protesting against the pay
ment of his salary, but he is of the.
opinion that no one would .take the
trouble to do so. It is quit* within th*Â»
range of probability that Mayor
Schmitz will take the bull by. the
horns and that Boyle's name will ap
pear as the new Commissioner of Pub
lic Works on the list of appointments
on the various boards, which the
Mayor has promised to announce late
this afternoon. Jeremiah Dineen, a
contractor, may get -the plum if Boyle
is jiot named.
Mayor Schmitz is Â«in a quandary be
tween his desire on the - one hand
to appoint Election Commissioner
Thomas F. Boyle as a member of the
Board of Public Works to succeed
Marsden Manson, whose term expires
to-morrow, and the charter provision
on the other prescribing: that "No
member of thef Board of Election
Commissioners shall during his term of
office be eligible to any other municipal
office during the term for ' which he
shall have been appointed or for one
year thereafter."
