REVOLUTIONISTS MAKING NO HEADWAY
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 26.â1n spite of the spread of the strike movement the authorities appear to
have the situation well in hand. The various revolutionary elements lack capable leadership, and it is believed
the worst of the crisis has parsed. Disturbances are occurring in Finland, but they are local in character. Only
one slight collision took place in Moscow yesterday.
OFFICIAL PROCLAMATION PLEDGES REFORMS IN FAVOR OF RUSSIAN WORKINGMEN
TREPOFF TRIES
TO BRING CALM
OUT OF CHAOS
FIRST ACT IS PACIFIC
Laborers Told Their Appeals
Will Be Heard When
Quiet Is Restored.
ST. PETERSBURG. Jan. 26 (2:15 a. m.)â Governor General Trepoff and
Minister of Finance KOkovseff Issued a proclamation last night which re
veals the Government's plan for breaking the strike, not only here, but
throughout Russia. The proclamation is conceived in a paternal tone and
points out that honest workmen, who want to better their condition, should
have brought their demands to the Government instead of being misled by
agitators into affiliating with a movement which is not confined to eco
nomic aspirations. It Invites them to return to work, promising
them, in the Emperor's name, a revision of the general law so as to restrict
the hours of labor, the institution of a plan for state insurance and other
wise to meet their demands so far as the law will permit, and guarantee
. them protection against interference by agitators. This document will be
followed either by an Imperial manifesto, along the same lines. In the hope
of preventing the spread of the strike, or by specific proclamations by the
local authorities, wherever strikes are in progress. By promising to yield
the question of the hours of labor, which are now legally eleven in Russia,
the authorities believe they will meet the main grlveance of the workmen.
This, together with the guarantee of protection, the authorities hope, will
induce those strikers who are Indifferent to political demands, and which
class they declare constitutes a great bulk of the men, to resume work.
Sir Charles Hardlnge, the British Minister, received from Captain Grove,
the British Consul at Moscow, confirmation of the press dispatch from
Moscow announcing public posting of a London telegram imputing the
disorders to British and Japanese Influences and he will ask for explana
tions from Foreign Minister Lamsdorff to-day. It is not expected, however,
that the affair will lead to a serious diplomatic incident, and it is believed
the Russian Government will disavow responsibility for the course of Act
ing Chief of Police Roudneff. The dispatch to Embassador Hardinge makes
no mention of Roudneff's offer to meet Captain Grove in a duel.
TEXT OF TREFOFF'S P/70CL4 MA TIO/V.
The full text of the proclamation issued by Governor General Trepoff
â¢ and Minister of Finance Kokovzeff, which will be posted in the street to
day, follows:
"Workmen should assist the Government In its tranquillizing task in be
half of the betterment of their condition. This they can accomplish only by
holding themselves aloof from fomenters of disturbance, who are alien to the
workmen's true interest and to the country's welfare. Let them return to
their ordinary labor, which Is as needful for the country as for themselves,
for without it they, their wives and children must suffer distress; and, re
â¢ turning to work, let the people be assured that their needs are as
Emperor's heart as those of all his Majesty's true subjects; that only recent
ly of his own free will the Emperor commanded that the question of work
ingmen's insurance be taken up, with the object of securing them against
disablement or sickness; that this measure does not exhaust his Majesty's
anxiety for the well being of the working classes, for at the same time the
Emperor sent an order instructing the Ministry of Finance to draft a law
shortening the hours of labor and for the elaboration of such measures as
will legalize workmen's discussions of their needs."
The proclamation concludes as follows:
"Let it be known to all workmen who return to their labors that they
may count upon the protection of the Government and freedom from harm
for themselves, their families, hearths and homes. The Government will pro
tect them from any criminal attack on the freedom of their labor by evil
disposed persons, who, loudly preaching liberty, understand it only as the
right to use forcible means to prevent their comrades from returning to their
peaceful employment." Â«
The proclamation, which, it is announced, was issued by the Emperor's
order, in its preamble recounts the origin of the recent events and declares
that evil disposed persons used the workmen as their tools, leading them
astray by false and impossible promises. It says:
"The result of this criminal agitation has been breaches of the peace, in
volving the inevitable intervention of armed forces. These evil wishers have
not been restrained even by the difficulties in which the fatherland is in
volved in a time of trying war, while the workmen, their blind tools, have
disregarded the fact that demands were being made in their name which
had nothing in common with their needs, besides forgetting that the Govern
ment always has shown Itself considerate of their needs and is now ready
to listen attentively to their Just desires and satisfy them wherever possible.
To this end the Government requires, above all. the restoration of order and
the return of workmen to work, because in times of disturbance the Gov
ernment's well-intentioned efforts for satisfaction of the workmen's demands,
however Just, is out of the question."
COSSACKS DISPERSE MOSCOW MOB.
MOSCOW, Jan. 25.âA squadron of Cossacks this evening dispersed about
3000 workmen who were growing obstreperous across the Moskva. No fatali
ties are reported. This was the only event of the kind during the day. Re
ports that a mob was plundering and wrecking shops In the Trevskala are
untrue.
The merchants have sent an appeal to the Emperor to avoid bloodshed.
There is complete tranquillity within the boundaries of this city, but the
people are keeping Indoors, owing to the official warning. The strike is
spreading gradually, but thus far is confined to the smaller mills. The
larger industrial concerns are being guarded in order to prevent the men
employed there being Intimidated, but it is the belief that the strike will
become general.
There are no troops in sight in the city proper. Probably there will be
no newspapers to-morrow. The citizens are alarmed at the prospect of an
Irruption of hundreds of thousands of workmen and demand the proclama
tion of a state of siege. The Moscow garrison numbers no more than 20,000
men, but the authorities consider this Is sufficient for present needs and are
determined to avoid bloodshed if possible. They declare they have the situ
ation well in hand. ....
Captain Grove, the British Consul, has called upon Roudneff, the As
sistant Police Master, who is acting In the absence of Chief Volkoff, and re
quested an explanation of the posted- telegram from London alleging that
the disturbances at the Russian dockyards and arsenal were due to Anglo-
Japanese Instigation; that both Great Britain and Japan are spending vast

THE San Francisco CALL
PRESIDENT
SURRENDERS
TO SENATE
Change in Plans Re
garding Santo
Domingo.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL, BUREAU, POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 25.âPresident
Roosevelt, instead of attempting to
establish an American protectorate
over Santo Domingo by his own act,
without any reference of the question
to Congress, has decided to send to the
Senate the treaty or protocol with the
island republic providing for the new
order of things. His sudden reversal
is due' to the certainty of a serious
clash with the Senate if he attempted
to carry out his original intention to
ignore that body, to a discussion In
the. Committee of Foreign Relations
this afternoon, and to the probability
of armed conflict with the rebels in
Santo Domingo.
Official announcement of the change
in the President's policy was made to
day. It was explained that there never
had been any other intention than to
submit the arrangement with Santo
Domingo to the Senate for approval.
It was said that it was not known,
and would not be known until Com
mander Dillingham reached Washing
ton, whether his agreement with
President Morales was In the form of
a treaty or a protocol. Whatever
shape it was in, it was stated, it would
be sent to the Senate and nothing fur
ther would be done until the Senate
had approved or rejected *he conven
tion.
The proposed arrangement by which
this country is to become receiver for
Santo Domingo and Mr. Roosevelt to
assume the role of policeman for Cen
tral and South America was not men
tioned to any of the Republican lead
ers in the Senate.
Before the President decided to sub
mit the question to the Senate there
was an angry discussion in the Sen
ate Committee on Foreign Relations.
The word "impeachment" was used.
Senator Spooner, one of the strong
est supporters of the administration,
pointed out to the Democrats how the
President could be impeached. In the
course of a long speech before the
committee on the Bacon resolution,
calling upon the President for a state
ment as to whether the press dis
patches and the announcement by As
sistant Secretary Loomls regarding the i
virtual establishment of suzerainty j
over Santo Domingo contained the
true facts, Spooner made his sensa
tional utterances. He said that if the
President answered that the publica
tions were accurate, showing that he
had violated the constitution in per
fecting a treaty without the advice or
consent of the Senate, it could be used
as a basis for impeachment proceed
ings.
This was construed as meaning that

Lillian Russell Re

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 25.âLillian Russell
to-day refused to appear at Mrs. Stuy
vesant Fish's party on Friday night
with a Lady Teazle cap.
"I should refuse to act in any one's
home as a paid performerâa clownâto
amuse guests after dinner," said Miss
Russell. "It would place me in a menial
position, which I can avoid by refusing
to go to Mrs. Fish's house. I have been
entertained in homes of quite as much
importance as Mrs. Fish's, and there
is a difference in performing in private
and on the stage."
Mrs. Fish said to-night Miss Russell
had not been asked to sing for her
guests.
if the Democrats desired to pursue the
subject to a culmination the proper
course was to offer a resolution in the
House, where impeachment proceed
ings must originate.
The Foreign Relations Committee
devoted an hour and a half to a dis
cussion of the Bacon resolution of in
quiry, which was referred to it yes
terday by vote of the Senate. There
was no disposition among any of the
members of the Foreign Relations
Ccmmittee to shield the President if
he had violated the constitution.
Neither was evidence given in com
mittee of any disposition on the part
of the Democrats to take up the sug
gestion thrown out by Senator Spooner
that the information from the Presi
dent, if he responded to the Bacon
resolution, might form the basis for
impeachment proceedings. It is not
believed the Democrats care to press
the matter, now that the Republicans
arc aroused and will take action look
ing to the prevention of further en
croachment by the President upon the
Senate's prerogatives.

MR. BRYAN
LAYS DOWN
PARTY LAW
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Jan. 25.âWilliam Jen
nings Bryan in a three-hour conference
this afternoon with Alton B. Parker
made several things plain to the recent
ly defeated candidate for the Presi
dency.
First, that he believes he (Bryan) and
his friends are now the dominating fac
tion of the Democratic party.
Second, that within a few years there
will be great internal changes in both
party organizations, and men who now
call themselves Democrats will come
out openly as Republicans, while pro
fessed Republicans will declare them
selves Democrats.
Third, that the new strength for the
Democratic party will come from the
West, while the new Republicans will
appear In the Eastern States.
Fourth, that for the reason that the
West and South will remain steadfast
they must have a dominating voice In
the party councils.
Fifth, that the trust question will
overshadow everything else in the next
campaign; that President Roosevelt's
acts In following out the provisions of
Democratic platforms and resolutions
will be an aid to the party, it being the
belief that the President will be al
lowed to go just so far and then ob
stacles will arise in Congress, and that
the present course of the President
should cause every Democrat to con
gratulate himself.
Bryan told Parker that one cause of
the recent disastrous defeat was that
the party had so temporized that it had
resulted In being neither Democratic
nor Republican. Parker was told, too,
that local Democrats would realize the
strength of Bryan's position and turn
in to help in future campaigns. There
was no discussion of the financial ques.
tlon, Bryan acknowledging that other
issues were of more importance.

IN BATTLE
MANILA, Jan. a battle this
morning in a river bed near Silang
between a detachment of scouts and
constabulary and 100 armed ladrones,
who,-under the leadership of the out
law, Fejizardo, attacked the town of
San Francisco de Malabon, In the
province of Cavite, last Tuesday night,
ten ladrones were killed and several
taken prisoners. There were no
casualties among the scouts and con
stabulary. Severe fighting continues.
In their attack on the town on
Tuesday nisrht the ladrones captured
the wife and two children of Governor
Trias. These, together with several
native women prisoners, were seen
with the ladrones this morning, but
an attempt to rescue them was un
successful.
Additional details regarding the at
tack by ladrones on San Francisco de
Malabon, in which Contract Surgeon J.
A. O'Neill was killed, show that the la
drones numbered 300. They were led by
the famous outlaws Montalon and Feli
zardo, who Were aided by two Ameri
can negroes. The ladrones were armed
with over 130' rifles.
Besides Surgeon O'Neill, one private
of the constabulary was killed and
three were seriously wounded.
The municipal treasury was looted of
$2000, and twenty-five Remington rifles
were taken by the ladrones. The rebels
were dressed in constabulary uniforms,
and this fact created considerable con
fusion.

The demonstration which was begun

POWERFUL AID

Center Party in Prussian
Diet Is Supporting the
Cause of the Workingmen
BERLIN, Jan. 25.âThe Center party
in a resolution presented in the Prus
sian Diet to-day asked the Government
to appoint seven members of the Diet
to investigate the coal strike. This was
done in the interest of the strikers, who
hope to force the owners of the mines
into a still more difficult position, as
they have refused an invitation of the
Commissioners appointed by the Min
istry of the Interior to discuss the situ
ation with the delegates of the work
lngmen. The commission asked for by
the Center party would have powers
that the Interior Department Commis
sion does not have for summoning per

ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 25. â Gov
ernor General Trepoff was in supreme
command of the city to-day. Although
a state of siege has not been actually
proclaimed, it practically exists, the
Emperor having conferred upon him,
as Governor General, almost absolute
power, authorizing him to use the mil
itary, gendarmerie and any other
agency of the Government to preserve
order, placing under his control the
Government works and schools and
even empowering him to exile persons
who are inimical to peace. During last
night hundreds of arrests were made.
The only decision of the Government
thus far is to preserve order at all
costs.
"The Government is living over a vol
cano, and can do nothing else," said a
high official thiÃ morning. "Every
ether consideration must give way to
the question of public order."
Private advices from all the big cit
ies and towns of Russia indicate that
there is excitement everywhere. The
red flag demonstrations at Helsingfors,'
Finland, last night were disquieting,
but there is no evidence yet of a gen
eral movement. The appointment of
Senator Linder as Secretary of State
for Finland just at this time is con
sidered to be an unfortunate blunder,
and is likely to prove exceedingly dis
tasteful to the Finns. Although a Finn
himself, Senator Linder is unpopular,
owing to his support of the policy of
the Russification of the towns of the
Baltic provinces.
STRIKERS HAVE LARGE FUND.
Evidence accumulates that the strik
ers are supplied with money to meet
their present needs. All sorts of stories
are afloat as to the size and origin of
the fund. Money Is undoubtedly being
supplied by the Liberals. It is said
that they have a fund of $2,000,000,
some of which was advanced by Ger
man Socialists. It is seriously believed
In some quarters that money Is be
ing furnished from Japanese-British
sources to bring on a revolution, or
such internal complications as will
compel the Government to make peace
with Japan.
Reports late this afternoon were that
the strike was extending at Narva,
Saratoff and Kbarkoff.
Some foreign correspondents, who
have been indulging in the wildest ex
aggeration of the situation, are now, In
anticipation of arrest, trying to ar
range for the embassies of their re
spective countries to make proper rep
resentations in their behalf.
The strikers seem still to be without
definite plans for the future. It is said
that a demonstration has been decided
upon for to-morrow, on the occasion of
the funerals of several of : the more
prominent victims, but this is denied.
For the moment the strikers appear to
be content to remain quiet.
All of the outgoing trains are filled
w r lth people going abroad, mostly for
eigners. Mr. and Mrs. W. E. Smith and
their family have left St. Petersburg
for Berlin.

day's tragedy were held this morning.
Pitiful sights were witnessed. In sev
eral cases a man and wife carried be
tween them a wooden box containing a
child killed. Some of the coffins were
borne on common carters' sleighs, the
mourners following on foot, according
to the Russian custom. It was notice
able that in many cases the usual
priest and ikon ahead of the procession
were absent. No demonstration oc
curred, but workmen and others stood
uncovered in the streets as the little
groups passed with the dead. In the
Volkoff Cemetery, beyond the Narva
gates, 167 bodies were lowered to their
last resting place. ,
A notice was posted to-day at all the
works, giving the strikers twenty-four
hours to resume their employment and
intimating that those who did not com
ply would be deported to villages.
It is expected that a message from
Emperor Nicholas will to-morrow be
delivered to the workmen, through the
Minister of Finance.

the Rioting on Sunday
LONDON, Jan. 25.âThe Foreign Of
fice views the situation in Russia with
alarm. It believes that, while the pre
sent risings will be put down, the af
fair of Sunday at St. Petersburg is cer
tain to bring about a change In the
form of government. The Foreign Of
fice would welcome a Russian govern
ment with which it could enter a treaty
agreement similar to the Anglo-French
agreement, feeling that a contract with
the present regime would be repudiated
at will. But fears are entertained of
a revolution which might result in in
ternational complications.
The remarks of War Secretary Ar
nold-Forster at Croydon last night,
when he expressed the sympathy of the
people of the United Kingdom with the
people of Russia, are exciting consider
able comment, coming from a Cabinet
Minister. He seemed to voice the gen
eral suspicion that the British Govern
ment has of Russian bureaucracy. Ar
nold-Forster also made the astound
ing statement that It would be a bold
man who would say whether this move
ment would be likely to help
or hurt the British nation, but "We
must be on our guard."
The British press as a whole takes a
no less gloomy view. The papers have
been given up exclusively since Sunday
to alarmist reports from Russia, hos
tile articles and scathing editorials on
"the massacre," one of the mildest
terms used for the affair of Sunday,
and the Russian Emperor and his Gov
ernment are generally compared to
"beasts at bay."
THOUSANDS SLAIN WITH PEN.
The whole discussion of the situation
in Russia serves again to reveal the
poorly disguised hostility of the British
press to everything Russian. The spe
cial dispatches to the London papers
all report the conditions prevailing in
Russia to be worse than the Associated
Press accounts. The Russian official
figures of the killed and wounded are
stigmatised as ' ludicrously official."
The nuniber of slain reported here in
Monday's papers ranged from 2000 to
8000. One prominent paper announced
that the dead alone numbered 2000 and
another said 8000. The Associated Press
figures, 800, given on Monday, are now
considered at the embassies here as the
maximum.
Exaggerations are noticed in most of
the reports. A notable instance is a
long account of an alleged mutiny of
sailors of the Black Sea fleet, and a de
tailed account of an incendiary Are at
the Sevastopol works, which later was
contradicted by the Associated Press
correspondent.
Many articles are appearing in the
papers and reviews by prominent au
thorities on Russia, arguing the cer
tain success of the revolution, but they
seem inspired more by the hope of the
writers than by facts.
Prfhce Sviatopolk-Mirsky, a cousin
of the Russian Minister of the Interior
and Becond secretary of the embassy
here, said to-dayj
"It Is certain that last Sunday's
events in St. Petersburg are grossly
exaggerated in all the European press.
I am sure normal tranquillity will soon
be restored."
The Prince expressed no surprise
that the Emperor had declined to re
ceive a deputation of 100,000 workmen,
who pleaded, among other demands,
for the separation of the church from
the state.
NO PRESS CENSORSHIP.
LONDON, Jan. 26.âSome of the Lon
don morning papers complain that the
Russian censorship of news dispatches
has been relmposed. These complaints
are quite unjustified. The Associated
Press and other di itches are coming
freely from St. Petersburg, Moscow
and other Russian cities, but are suf
fering serious delay in transmission,
probably owing to the pressure on the
wires, all the European journals the
past week having been daily increas
ing the length of their Russian dis
patches.
It should be mentioned, however, rs
a curious fact, that the alleged censor
ship appears chiefly to have affected
those journals which have Indulged in
the dissemination of wild and extrava
gant reports. That no real censorship
is exercised is evident from Associated
Press and other dispatches which con
tinue to comment with perfect free
dom on the political situation.
The Daily Telegraph's correspondent ,
at St. Petersburg declares that In the
whole empire there is but one official so
utterly loathed as Trepoff and that is
General KUegeb of Kleff, who may yet
be Minister of the Interior. He con
tinues:
"Russia is cloven in twain and no
human force can weld the parts to
gether. On one side stands the auto-'
crat, whose behests are still mechani
cally fulfilled by his Majesty's army,
which, however, Is a section of the
people. On the other hand stands the
empire nation, united In the determina- i
tion to deliver itself from a yoke which i
has now become unbearable. The army j
is acting In virtue of use and wont and ;
in time will come over to its own kith ,
and kin."
This is taken as evidence that the
censorship Is not so very strict.

Members of the Romanoff
Family Accused of Arti
ficially-Arresting the De
velopment of the Nation
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 25.âThe
council of the Polytechnic Institute
to-day adoptefj the following':
One of the memberÂ» of tha family of tha
Polytechnic Institute of St. Petersburg;, the
Student Savinkln, died a violent death, being
â¢hot on January 22 in the Alexander Qardens.
Savinkln was one of the victims of the butch
ery against a peaceful, unarmed crowd. The
council of the Institute, being revolted and
depressed by the acta of January 22, which
prove that In Russia the very Uvea of peace
able citizens are unsafe, expresses profound
indignation on account of the general firing,
one of the victims of which waa the student
Savinkln. The councU finds that peace unde>
the present conditions existing is absolutely
Impossible, and resolves, first, to Inform the
Minister of Finance of the opinions of the
council regarding the events of January 22;
second, to suspend lectures in the Institute:
and third, to defray the cost of the funeral
of Savinkln.
The students of the institute sent a
declaration to the director, declaring
their' agreement with the resolution.
Fourteen members of the Zemstvo
of Simblek (on the Volga, 105 miles
south-southwest of Kazan) have
adopted the following resolutions:
During our whole lives we have been forced
to observe silence in all our new ideas. The
authorities see specters threatening to destroy
the foundations of state. For forty years we
Have said "All is well." We had been so ac
customed to this course that to say otherwise
would have been a political crime. This atti
tude on the part of the people debased to
slavery has led Russia to a crisis through
which she cannot safely be brought by pal
liatives or half measures. Russia is on the
road to complete ruin, and the fatherland is
threatened with terrible danger, not alone by
the foreign enemy with whom she is now
struggling, but by an Internal foe against
whom the bureaucracy has been bo long fight
ing with disastrous results.
The danger lies In the prostration of the
general development of the country, brought
about by the bureaucracy. The development
of Russia has been artificially arrested, and
all other institutions stricken unto death and
cannot be brought back to life. The very de
pressed condition of the country also consti
tutes a danger front which there is no escape.
The Zemstvo representatives had no oppor
nlty of freely and honestly speaking their
minds on the subjects of abuses, but the
bureaucrat* took measures to prevent them.
The president of the Zemstvo proposed an
amendment to this resolution, but our duty
to the fatherland and the throne obliged us
to refuse to vote the address in the form he
suggested. It is a crime to shut our eyes to
the condition of the country. Freely elected
representatives alone can liberate Russla.
These representatives would point to Russia
and the Emperor a new path to peace and
Slory.
SttfPKROPOL, Jan. 25.âThe Zems
tvo at Taurida, at its first meeting of
the year to-day, unanimously adopted
the following petition to Emperor
Nicholas: 'â¢
Sire: The Taurida Zemstvo congratulates
your Majesty, as well as the Empress, on the
birth of an heir to the throne. This event oc
curred in a terrible year of national grief, a
year of cruel and bloody war, a year of bitter
Internal disorder. Let peace dawn on Russia
and her frontiers. That is the best wish
Russian subjects can express at the cradle of
your son.
Tour decree of December 25 held out to the
nation hopes of internal peace In the future,
which everywhere is dependent on the preser
vation and maintenance of the law and equal
rights of citizens, on freedom of conscience
and religion, freedom of speech and the press,
freedom of association and public meetings.
Sire: We are strongly convinced that the
fulfillment of all your great Intentions for their
Inviolability can only be assured by the par
ticipation of elected representatives of the
whole nation in the legislative power. We sin
cerely believe that In the union of the power
of the state with that of the people can be
found the only pledge for the complete devel
opment of the productive forces of the coun
try.
If you summon representatives of the nation
to take part in the legislation, finance and ad
ministrative control and fulfillment of the law
and the intentions of your Imperial Majesty,
you will make Russia powerful and invincible
from without and flourishing within her bor
ders In the light of right and truth.

Winter has its pleasures. The skat

sports of winter, combined with Its pure,
bracing atmosphere, all tend toward pro
ducing a healthy condition of the body.
Yet, in spite of these pleasures, winter
brings Its ills. Most of them are in the
nature of climatic diseases-
People are sometimes not as careful as
they should be. They expose themselves
unduly.
They are caught in cold, sleety rain.
They enter the house with damp shoes
and clothing and do not take the time or
trouble to change to dry clothing.
They sit about the house and breathe
the vitiated air of stuffy, unventllated
rooms.
They do not take enough outdoor exer
cise and neglect hygienic precautions.
The amusements of the long evenings
create a tendency to keep late hours ana
eat heavy meals before retiring.
All of these indiscretions create ca
tarrhal diseases.
Coughs, colds, bronchitis, croup, pneu

indigestion and stomach catarrh are al
most as prevalent as in summer.

LONDON, Jan. 26. âThe report of

of the proved coal field at 100,000.000,
--000 tons, which at the present increas

years. The commissioners expect that,
owing to physical considerations, the
rate of the increase of the'output will
soon be slower and will be followed by
a period of stationary output and then
by a gradual decline, which will pro
long the duration of the resources.GOVERNOR AND MRS. PARDEE RECEIVE STATE OFFICIALS

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 25.âThe Exe
cutive Mansion was the scene to-night
â¢>f the first official reception held dur
ing the residence of Governor and Mrs.
. George C. Pardee here and it was in
â¢ very respect a brilliant event. Sacra
mento had witnessed nothing of the
kind since the days of Governor and
Mrs. Leland Stanford's residence here
years ago, when their handsome home
' was the scene of many notable recep
tions.
It has been the custom of the Gov
ernors of later years to retain their
residence in the localities whence they
were called to serve the State, and the
capital city was little more to them
than to the average legislatorâa so
journing place for a period only. But
Governor and Mrs. Pardee in taking
their abode in the new Executive
Mansion have entered fully into the
social life of Sacramento and the pres
â¢ t' was only one of a series of recep
tit>ns they have planned. Some time next
â¢ keek a card party will be given at
the mansion to the ladies of Sacramen
lo ny Mrs. Pardre, her sister, Miss Etta
Penniman. and Mrs. Alden Anderson,
ife of the Lieutenant Governor. In
the week follow ing there will be a
< . pLion at the mansion to the people
of. Sacramento of the same general
character as the official function to
l.ight.
Governor and Mrs. Pardee about two
â¢ks ago issued invitations to all the
State officials, including in each in
stance a deputy also, asking themselves
Mini wives to be present at their home
this evening. Fully 600 of those re
â  ivlng them responded in person to-.
. I ight.
The purchasing of a home for the
Governor of the State has proved a
great blessing for Sacramento, since the
interests which should have been cen
tered here have of late years been neg
lected on account of there being no suit
able official residence. Governor and
Mis. Pardee have done much for the
society of Sacramento and it is well
appreciated. The reception to-night

before met and many of whom might

Parde- and Lieutenant Governor and
Mrs. Anderson, who received the
guests. Miss Etta Penniman. Mrs.
Pardee's sister, stood in the hall and

FILCHER TELLS
OF A SURPLUS
Commission to St. Louis
Has $6000 in Coin to
Turn Back to the State
a
Commissioner J. A. Filcher reports
that the California Commissioners to
the St. Louis Exposition will have a
balance of cash unexpended, amount
ing to about $6000, to turn back into
the State treasury from the $130,000 ap
propriated by the Legislature for ad
vertising the State at St. Louis. In ad
dition to this the Commissioners have
exhibit material that cost $14,000 in
readiness to show at the Lewis and
Clark Exposition at Portland this year.
This has been removed to Portland and
is stored there ready for installing as
soon as the California building is con
structed.
Practically all the educational ex
hibit of the State that was displayed
at St. Louis is at Portland, says Fil
cher. The mining exhibits that are
there assembled include samples of all
the mineral products of the State and
amount in bulk to about thirty-five
tons. The forestry exhibit material
was nearly all removed from St. Louis
to Portland. The Commissioners
bought and have gold nuggets to con
siderable value that are safely stored
and are ready to be put in the show
when the time comes.
The material that the University of
California had on show at St. Louis is
available and can be had for Portland.
A part of the State agricultural and
horticultural show from St. Louis is
also at Portland. The accounts of the
State at the St. Louis Exposition are
not completely wound up, but Filcher
Is sure that at least $6000 in coin will
remain to be covered back into the
State treasury when all bills are sea
tled.

SENATOR WRIGHT FAVORS FREE SCHOOL BOOKS FOR ALL PUPILS
PROPOSES AN AMENDMENT
TO STATE CONSTITUTION
.Manufacturers File
: Protest With the
Senate.
a
Oppose Giving More
Power to Inter
state Body.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
' SACRAMENTO, Jan. 25.âSurprise
was created in the Senate this morning
when a resolution from the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association of
â¢California was received protesting
against any action on the part of the
Legislature tending to vest the Inter
state Commerce Commission with the
arbitrary right to make rates. The as
sociation, In its communication, says
that such action would not be to the
advantage of business and that the in
terests of the coast will be best sub
served by leaving the authority to
make rates where it now stands.
; The association suggests, however,
that the Interstate Commerce Com
mission be increased to seven mem
bers, one new member to come from
the East, the other from the West. The
law under which the commission is now
operating, the communication con
cludes, is proper if proper measures be
taken to expedite appeals, which would
contemplate the establishment of a
court of transportation, whose decrees
would be final except in cases In which
constitutional questions were Involved.
The. communication was ordered on file
to be printed in the journal.
A resolution was offered by Senator
Keane this morning to amend section
8 of article 11 of the State constitution
relating to city charters, providing
that it shall be mandatory upon Boards
â¢of Supervisors to submit to the voters
any proposed charter amendments
â¢w:hen the same have been presented by
â¢a petition signed by fifteen (15) per cent
of the qualified electors of, the munici
palities wherein they reside, nd pre
scribing that charters may be amended
at intervals of not less than twenty
three .months instead of two years as
under the present law. This will obviate
the objection raised in a recent Su
preme Court decision, which held that
two complete years must elapse before
amendments can be voted for at suc
ceeding periods, as the days of gen
eral elections occur on the first Tues
day after the first Monday in Novem
ber, which frequently does not allow
the full expiration of the two-year
terms.
! A further advantage is gained in this
respect, that charter amendments do
hot become operative until ratification
by the Legislature and these changes
permit nmendments'to be approved by
the people on the same days that can
didates for the Legislature are elected,
thereby allowing the r nendments to be
acted upon at the session immediately
succeeding the election.
SALARIES OF GUARDS.
. Senator Keane also introduced a bill
â providing for the increase of salaries
of guards at the State prisons from
$600 to $900 a year.
Another bill relating to the prisons
was prosented by Belshaw. It Is an
amendment of the bill presented in
1903 by Grove L. Johnson providing
for the establishment of a California
Relief Committee, the duty of which
shall be to oversee, guide and provide
employment for men that have been
discharged from the prisons of the
State after the expiration of their
terms. The bill was referred to the
committee on Prisons and Reforma
tories.
The bill providing for the granting
by California to the Federal Govern
ment of the right to drain the Klamath
Basin Lakes, in connection with its
reclamation work, and to cede to the
Government the beds of such lakes for
storage and irrigation purposes was
finally passed, but not until after
Senator Emmons had filed a petition
signed by some scores of citizens of
Hanford and Los Angeles asking that
the bill be defeated as they are pre
paring to reclaim the lake beds at their
own expense. After the passage of the
bill Emmons moved for a reconsidera
tion, which was granted, the bill re
taining its place on the file. Before
the bill is again taken up the purposes
of the petitioners will be looked into.
A novel scheme to pay for the work
of correcting the channels of the Sacra
mento and San Joaquin rivers and
reclaiming the inundated lands of
their basins is advanced in a communi
cation received this morning from the
California Miners' Association. The
association asks that the Legislature
enact a law providing for the volun
tary conveyance to the State by pres
ent owners or the acquirement by the
State by process .of eminent domain
of all the Inundated lands, the same,
after their reclamation, to be leased by
-the State, the accruing rents to be
utilized for the payment of the work
of reclamation. The communication
was referred to the Committee on
Swamp and Overflowed Lands. The "ac
tion thus proposed is but a new appli
cation of the Federal irrigation law.

ONE OF SAN FRANCISCO'S REPRESENTATIVES IN THE LOWER HOUSE OF
THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND TWO MEMBERS' " fflOT INTERIOR
COUNTIES WHO ARE TAKING AN ACTIVE PART IN PROCEEDINGS.
President of the Senate appointed
a committee this morning to in
vestigate ' the financial system of
the University of California. Carter
was appointed chairman of the com
mittee and will be aided In his investi
gations by Lukens, Selvage, Leeke and
Sanford. The committee will take up
Its work next week.
Senator Welch introduced a bill that
will Interest every consumer of gas In
the State. It provides that upon appli
cation all gas and electric lighting
companies shall install pipes or con
duits without charge to the consumer
or deposit by him when the residence
of such consumer shall be within 300
feet of the main pipes or conduits of
such lighting companies. The bill fur
ther provides that the companies shall
cause to be published a complete list,
for eight weeks of each year, of all
persons from whom they have exacted
deposits for meters or other installa
tions, the object being to thus deter
mine whether or not the companies are
living up to the preceding provisions of
the law.
Here is a proposed amendment to the
constitution of the State, proposed by
Senator Wright, that will receive the
approval of the parents of the State. It
provides for the issuance to all school
children of all books required by the
various courses of study without
charge. There have been many hard
fought battles over the question of free
school books, but Senator Wright says
this fact does not daunt him and he is
sure of the support of both houses at
the present session.
The last bill on the file taken up for
final action to-day is that providing for
the decent burial by the various Boards
of Supervisors of all ex-soldiers of the
United States. It passed without a dis
senting voice.
Senator E. L Wolfe of San Francisco
presented In the upper house to-day a
bill providing for the amendment of the
election law In relation to registry and
the counting of ballots. This is the bill
that raised a storm when presented by
Atkinson in the Assembly yesterday, it
being apparent that it held a "bug."
When Wolfe heard this afternoon thai
objections had been raised to the bill
he announced that he would withdraw
It to-morrow. He explained that the bill
had been Introduced by him upon re
quest and that he did not look over it
carefully, leaving this work for the
committee. He said he would save the
committee this work, however, by with
drawing the bill and seeing that it is
put in proper shape before it is again
offered.
PROTECTION FOR CHILDREN.
Measures Looking Toward Their Re
lief Introduced in Senate.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 26.âThe chil
dren of California will receive the full
est attention of the present Legislature.
Measures looking to their protection
have been introduced in the Senate by
Lukens of Alameda, at the instance of
M. J. White, secretary of the Califor
nia Society for the Prevention of Cruel
ty to Children. Though the measures
take a wide range the most interest
ing is that making the sale of infants
a felony. That marts where children
are bartered away for gold exist in all
of the large cities of the State, partic
ularly San Francisco, is well known, 1
but by various subterfuges the guilty
have generally escaped punishment.
The proposed law td do away with this I
inhuman practice, the tiny victim gen- 1
erally being of illegitimate parentage, I
is as follows:
Any person who willfully sells or offers to
sell an infant, child or human being; or any !
person who in any manner or under any pre
tense or claim gives away, parts with, in- !
dentures or disposes of an Infant, child or!
human being for money, goods, favor or con- '
sioeratlon or promise of consideration of any \
kind whatsoever: or any person who In any I
manner or under any pretense or claim will- |
fully offers to give away, part with, indenture .

being for money, goods, favor or consideration
or promise of consideration of any kind what
soever Is guilty of a felony and upon oon
viction shall be punished by Impritonment In
the State prison not longer than ten years.
Another bill aimed to prevent the
abuse of children on the stage of pub
lic theaters was Introduced by Sena
tor Lukens. It is said that the pro
posed measure has the unqualified In
dorsement of the legitimate theater
managers of the State and that en
forcement of its provisions will fall
heaviest on the keepers of penny shows,
exhibitors of montrosities and theater
men of like ilk. The feature of the
bill is that it makes the Mayor of
every city or the President of the Board
of Trustees of every township the
judge as to what child should be al
lowed to perform and to regulate the
number of times such child shall play
and the duration of performances.

TONTINE SYNDICATES.
Senate Committee on Commissions
and Retrenchments Investigates,
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 25.âThe Sen
ate Committee on Commisslojis and
Retrenchments has decided that the
Bardwell-Ford syndicate of San Fran
cisco, of which J. S. Joselyn is the
head, the firm having succeeded the
discredited Guarantee Investment
Company, Is not operating upon legal
lines and will so report to the Senate
to-morrow. Another tontine syndi
cate of San Francisco, of which one
Gunsberger is the manager, Is under
Investigation to-night and will be re
ported upon later. After the Investi
gation has been completed It is an
nounced that a bill wlii be drafted
which will put all firms that are
found to be operating illegally out of
business. It was also announced to
night that the investigation of the af
fairs of the Continental Building and
Loan Association of San Francisco
will begin to-morrow, the principal
aim being to determine the solvency
of the corporation and the alleged of
fenses of William Corbin, its secre
tary and manager. The investigation
will be open.
SOUTHLAND CORPORATION
IS VERY BADLY DISRUPTED
President Is a Fugitive, One Director
Is In Jail, While Still Another
Is a Suicide.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 25.âWith its
president a fugitive, one member of Its
directorate in Jail convicted of larceny,
another director dead by his own
hfinds, a fourth believed to be a fic
titious person and the fifth unable to
be located, the original directorate of
the Southern California Trust Com
pany, a seemingly regularly incorpor
ated institution, is sadly disrupted.
The company was organized several
months ago and from the number of
its creditors, who are now clamoring
for information as to the money they
invested, It appears to have transacted
a large business. It had a suite of of- I
flees in the Braly building and its big- 1
geet bid for business was the sale of
numerous lots in San Diego on the in
stallment plan. What the present con
dition of its finances may be can only
be conjectured, for inquiry at the of
fices elicits only the information that
the officers are out.
Committee Favors Normal School Bill
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 25.âThe As
sembly bill presented by McGowan,
appropriating- $150,000 for the Normal
School In San Francisco, took another
important step to-day toward becom
ing a law when the Ways and Means
Committee of the Assembly decided to
report it favorably. It has already
been approved by the Assembly Com
mittee on Education and has been
passed by the Senate. i
ROW ENLIVENS
THE ASSEMBLY
San Francisco's Delegation
Is Divided on Bill Relating
to the Assessment Maps
TAX COLLECTOR VICTOR
Measure Directing Assessor
to Furnish Him Desired
Data Passes Lower House
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 25.âThe As
sembly was enlivened this morning by
a rumpus over Assembly bill No. 121,
by Atkinson, providing that the maps
made annually by the Assessor pf the
City of San Francisco from the block
book in his office shall be turned over
to the Tax Collector each year atter use
has been made of them by the Asses
sor. There was a division of the San
Francisco delegation over the bill,
which is local to the metropolis. It is
always a matter of pleasure to the
members from the interior when the
representatives from the metropolis
fail out. They like a situation where
they can sway the destinies of San
Francisco's own measures.
The bill in question was passed at
yesterday morning's session, but
Treadwell gave notice that he would
move for a reconsideration to-day. This
he did and made a speech, which devel
oped the fact that there is a merry row
on between San Francisco's Assessor
and her Tax Collector over this seem
ingly trivial, matter, the disposition of
the annual assessment maps. The bat
tle has been fought out on the floor of
the Assembly and there the Tax Collec
tor has won. It was hinted during the
fight that the title insurance companies
ot San Francisco were interested.
SPEAKS FOX THE ASSESSOR.
"After the adjournment yesterday,"
said Treadwell, when the matter was
taken up this morning, "1 received a
telegram from Washington Dodge*. As
sessor of San Francisco, asking that he
be given a hearing on the bill before it
was finally passed. This bill provides
for the turning over to the Tax Collec
tor of the maps showing the location of
realty in San Francisco, taking away
from the Assessor's office what repre
sents the work of forty or fifty years."
Anthony said the transfer of the
maps would entail great expense.
"It appears that Mr. Treadwell has in
mind," replied- Atkinson, "the block
books kept permanently in the office of
the Assessor. The maps we want turn
ed over to the Tax Collector are not the
ones he refers to at all. The bill con
templates only those maps which are
made annually from the block book
and which the Assessor changes annu
ally by merely making erasures. The
Tax Collector handed me the bill, say
ing his records were not now complete.
He gets the assessment roll and other
data, but he needs these maps also. I
have experted the office of the Assessor
at various times for years and am fa
miliar with it. The other gentlemen,
who are opposing this measure, know
little about it."
"It seems the bill before us states
only the Tax Collector's side," said
Cromwell. "I think the Assessor should
be allowed to make his statement."
"The gentleman from San Francisco
says we know nothing about this bill,"
said Treadwell, "and yet he asks us to
pass it. What is wanted by those be
hind it is that the State of California
and the city of San Francisco shall
bear an expense that should fall cm
title insurance companies."
After some further discussion the roll
was called on a motion to reconsider,
which was lost by a vote of 37 for and
22 against, it requiring a majority of
all the members to carry such a mo
tion.
FIGHT GOES TO SENATE.
The bill now stands passed in the As
sembly and the fight between San
Francisco's Assessor and her Tax Col
lector over the annual realty maps will
be transferred to the Senate, which
must also pass the bill before It can go
to the Governor.
The bill providing how election bal
lots shall be counted, that was handed
Atkinson by the Registrar's office in
San Francisco for introduction and
and which, when it came up yesterday
for final passage was held over because
a noxious insect was discovered in its
folds, was finally passed this morning
with an amendment made by Atkinson
that covered the objection. The bill as
passed provides, as did the original
law, for the placing of the Initials of
election officers on the backs of ballots
for purposes of Identification.
The 'Assembly failed to pass Beards
lee's measure providing that a wife's
separate property shall be responsible
for debts incurred by her husband for
the necessaries of life while they were
living together as man and wife. The
author gave notice of reconsideration.
Gates' measure permitting School Su
perintendents of two or more counties
to call joint teachers' institutes was so
passed by the Assembly.
Slavin's joint resolution memorializ
ing the Federal Government to set
aside a tract of land including the Pin
nacles, in San Benito County, aa a na
tional park was unanimously adopted.
The Committee on Agriculture re
ported in favor of the passage of John
stone's bill providing an appropriation
for an agricultural farm. At the same
time the Committee on Education re
ported favorably the bill presented by
Hawkins for the same purpose.
INTERSTATE COMMERCE
COMMISSION'S TROUBLES
Witnesses Refuse to Give Testimony
That Might Incriminate
Themselves.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 25.âJudson C.
Clements, a member of the Interstate
Commerce Commission, replying before
the House Committee on Interstate and
Foreign Commerce to-day to a state
ment which he said had been made to
the effect that the commission had not
endeavored to enforce the provisions of
the law, said that it waa strange that
this should be said by people who have
violated the law.
He called attention to the investiga
tion instituted by the commission in the
matter of grain rates and packing
house products and the injunction pro
ceedings which resulted against the
carriers. The result had been, he said,
that the giving of rebates and devia
tion from published rates In the form
of rebates practically had disappeared.
He spoke of the difficulties experi
enced by the commission In obtaining
testimony because of the refusal of wit
nesses to testify, on the ground that to
do so would be to Incriminate them
selves.

SACRAMENTO, Jan. 25.âAmong
the interesting Assembly bills intro
duced to-day is one by Wlckersham
providing for the exclusion by popu
lar vote of territory already embraced
in the corporate limits of a municipal

dents of the territory so excluded shall
still be responsible for their share of
any Indebtedness of the city incurred
while they were included in It and
that the city shall have the power to
tax their property for that purpose
until such debt is paid.
McGowan presented a bill aimed to
elevate the profession of nursing by
providing that all those who are grad
uates of some hospital or training
school for nurses that may be ap
proved by the regents of the State
University may be registered by the
regents and given official license as
accredited nurses. It Is provided also
that # the regents shall select five upon
examination from those so registered
to constitute an examining board and
that all nurses, excepting those who
graduated subsequent to the passage
of the act, who wish to become ac
credited must undergo an examination
by this board. The bill does not pro
hibit any one from nursing for hire,
but provides that none not registered
shall style themselves registered
nurses.
Burke introduced a bill making it
unlawful to run trains or even light
engines out of railroad yards without
full train crews. The measure also

RECLAMATION MEASURES.
Congressman-Elect McKlnlay Will
Urge Their Immediate Passage.
. SACRAMENTO, Jan. 25.âCongress
man-elect McKlnlay of the Second
District is in town as a proponent of
the measures that will be introduced
in the Senate to-morrow or Friday,
providing for the raising of $24,000,
--000 to be used for the reclamation of
the inundated lands of the San Joa
quin and Sacramento basins. Mc-
Kinlay said to-night that he was go
ing to use every endeavor to secure
the passage of this bill, and also to
secure Congressional relief, because if
the great reclamation plan Is carried
through it will mean that lands ca
pable of maintaining 10,000,000 peo
ple will be recovered for the use of the
people of the State. The great pro
blem of California, he said in conclu
sion, is to Increase its population. No
better plan could be devised than to
reclaim these rich lands and place
them at the disposal of the tillers of
the soil.
DEMENTED MOTHER TRIES
TO KILL HER CHILDREN
Loads Revolver With, Wrong Style of
Cartridges and Uvea of Little
Ones Are Saved.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 25.â0n1y her
Ignorance of the use of firearms pre
vented a demented mother from mur
dering her five children and taking her
own life to-day, and to prevent the
possibility of a second attempt on her
part the authorities to-night took the
children from her and placed her
where she will be properly cared for.
The mother is Mrs. Jane Washington
(colored), who has worked for some of
the best known families of this city,
among whom she is regarded as being
above the average of persons of her
station in life. This afternoon she ap
proached a policeman and, showing
him a revolver, asked him why it
would not shoot. The weapon was in
perfect condition, but the officer found
that it was loaded with rim-fire
cartridges instead of those of central
fire and with such cartridges the re
volver was useless. In response to the
questions of the officer the woman
finally admitted that she had made
repeated attempts to Are the weapon
at her children and she wanted to know
how to shoot it. An investigation
showed that she had used half a box
of cartridges, not one of which had ex
ploded and this only had prevented a
tragedy. The officers found the woman's
five children locked in a room and the
eldest told how the mother had re
peatedly stood them in line and snap
ped the revolver at them.
The mother told a rambling story,
but the burden of it was that she had
been told that her husband, who is in
a hospital, would die before the end of
the week and she had decided to send
the children to heaven so that he
would meet them there and then she
intended to take her own life- so as to
join them. The woman's mind had
given away under the burden of
trouble. Her husband's illness had
taken the money which should have
gone for food and the family had had
nothing to eat for several days except
what neighbors had given them. The
children were taken In charge by the
Humane Society and the mother prop
erly cared for.

APPORTIONMENT BILL
Visit SacramentÂ© to Fight
the Proposed Measure. *
â¦
IS NOT FAIR TO THIS CITY
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 25.âA delega- â 
tion of San Francisco school officials
reached here this afternoon to opposej
the bill introduced by Rowell in the
Senate and Slavin in the Assembly
providing that the apportionment of
State school money shall be made on a
basis of $300 to the teacher instead of
the number of school children as at
present. In the party were Superin
tendent of Schools Lajigdon, School
Director Roncovieri and Principal Ce
cil Mark of the Crocker Grammar
School. Dr. d'Ancona, chairman of j
the finance committee of the Board of j
Supervisors, came up on the evening ,
train to help out.
Langdon, Roncovieri and Mark
talked to many legislators during the J
afternoon and explained to them the i
lossâs2ls,oooâSan Francisco would
sustain if the bill became a law.
Though the city pays $1,300,000 of State
taxes she gets but $865,000 of It back In
school money on the apportionment
made on the basis of the number of
pupils.
Another joint meeting of the Senate
and Assembly committees on education
was called for to-night at State Super
intendent Kirk's office, but there was |
not a quorum of either committee and
no action was taken. Senators Rowell,
Keane and Wolfe and Assemblymen
Bates, Jones of San Francisco, Anthony,
Chandler add Atkinson were there to
meet the San Francisco visitors. It
was pointed out by tne latter that If
the Supervisors of San Francisco were
unable to make up the the
proposed law would create, teachers'
salaries in the metropolis would have
to be cut or the Bchool term shortened.
Attention was also called to the fact
that hundreds of San Francisco census
school children are maintained at paro
chial and private schools and that
their parents have to pay the State
tax without deriving any benefit.
Alameda and Los Angeles would
also suffer under the proposed law, as
they are in a similar position to that
of San Francisco.
Another meeting of the committees
will be held to-morrow night. It is
thought a compromise measure will be
agreed upon.

PETROLEUM INDUSTRY.
Bill Is Introduced in Assembly Pro
viding for State Refinery.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 26.âThe most
radical bill pertaining to the oil indus
try that has been introduced before
this Legislature made its appearance
to-day. It is a bill by Assemblyman
John of San Luis Obispo, providing for
the establishment of a State refinery
to refine oil for public institutions as
the word refine is applied to the prepar
ing crude petroleum for various uses."
It is also provided that the "surplus so
refined shall be sold to the best ad
vantage."
The bill simply aims to place the
business of oil refining in the hands of
the State of California, It names a
commission to be composed of the Gov
ernor, Surveyor General and the man
ager of the refinery, the latter to be ap
pointed by the Governor, and shall re
ceive a salary of $5000 a year. The
manager, it is set forth, shall take
steps as soon as appointed to secure a
site, either by purchase or donation,
and also to acquire water rights and
producing oil wells and shall lay and
operate pipe when the refinery shall be
established. All purchases made by
him shall be approved by the rest of
the commission before they shall be
valid.
An appropriation of $250,000 is pro
vided to build and equip the refinery.
The purchase of the oil refined by
the State for the use of public institu
tions is made mandatory upon the
managers of such institutions.
It is provided that the manager of
the refinery may be removed for cause
approved by the Chief Justice of the
State Supreme Court or any Judge of
the District Court of Appeals in the dis
trict where the refinery may be located.
The bill if it becomes a law will go
into effect under a clause it contains
on January 1, 1906.

Francisco Superior Judges hy intro
ducing a bill in the Assembly provid
ing for a raise of the Loa Angeles and
the Alameda Superior Judges as well
as those of San Francisco. His meas
ure provides for an Increase from
$4000 to $5000. instead of $6000, as
wished by the San Franciscans for
their judiciary.
The bill fixes the rate of compensa
tion in many other counties. It pro
vides that the Honor of Alpine, who
ever he may be, shall gather to his
craggy nest the sum of $2000 annu
ally. In the $4000 list are placed San
Joaquin. Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, San
Mateo, Yuba, Sutter, Sacramento.
Butte, Nevada. Sonoma, Colusa, Mon
terey, San Luis Obispo. Shasta, Siski
you, Santa Barbara, San Diego, Marin,
Mendocino, Tehama, San Bernardino,
Kern, Placer, Humboldt, Tulare, Fres
no, Solano, Yolo and Contra Costa
counties. Many of these are in the
$3000 class now, but the Judges of
some of them already receive $4000.
In the $3500 class are placed Ama
dor, Calaveras, Stanislaus, Bl Dorado
and Tuolumne counties.
It looks as if the San Francisco del
egation would have to stand for the
raises in Los Angeles and Alameda, at
least, if it wishes to get an increase for
its own Judges. As a concession it
may get the $6000 stipend asked for.
Beardslee of San Joaquin intro
duced a bill providing that one addi
tional Superior Judge be added to the
bench of San Joaquin, which now has
two. This puts the San Joaquin dele
gation into the salary fight.
The bill providing for an increase in
the bench of Los Angeles of three Su
perior Judges has passed the Senate,
but is still on the third reading or
final passage file of the Assembly.
Favors Anti-Trading Stamp Bill.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 26.âSenator
Keane's anti-trading stamp bill re
ceived a unanimous recommendation
for passage by the Senate Judiciary
Committee to-day, after an extended
discussion of its legal and practical
merits. The validity of the bill Is
based upon the provisions of section
26, article IV. of the State constitu
tion, prohibiting lotteries or gift en
terprises, or the issuance of tickets for
such purposes.

ISOLATES CITY
OF NEW YORK
Fierce Gale, Snow and Intense
Cold Paralyze Traffic on
Atlantic Coast.
Â«
Many Succumb in the Metropolis
.. NEW YORK, Jan. 25.âNot since the
blizzard of 1888. by which all storms
are estimated as great or small, has
. New York been so completely snow
bound as it is to-night. The city itself
is lying under a foot of snow. In many
places it has been banked by the wind
to a height of several feet. Surface
travel early in the day was abandoned,
overhead transit was irregular and slow
and it remained for the underground
roads to carry home the hundreds of
thousands of workers from the down
town districts.
The entire coast line from the Dela
ware capes north has been in the grasp
of a storm which, because of its heavy
fall of snow, the intensity of the cold
and the force of the gale, has exceeded
in severity anything experienced in
years. From Maine, the New England
States and the Middle Atlantic States
have come reports of a most complete
winter tie-up. Far Into the West there
is snow and a remarkably low tem
perature. Everywhere railroad traffic
is delayed. Reports of disasters to ship
ping are coming in, and with the rap
idly falling thermometer much suffer
ing must ensue.
SEVERAL DIE FROM COLD.
So severe was the storm in this city
that even during the day hours several
persons were frozen to death or died
from exposure. To-night the hospitals,
. police stations and the House of Refuge
are crowded to their capacity. More
than once police reserves were called
out to take care of the crowds that
were struggling around the entrance to
some belated ferry-boat which was
soon to attempt another trip.
Long before sundown the homeward
' bound workers learned that trolleys
everywhere throughout Manhattan had
. been abandoned, that cable cars were
stalled in many places and that for
those who lived in the suburbs nothing
remained but to take up quarters
somewhere near at hand If they hoped
to return to work the following day.
â . Soon after 7 o'clock to-night a bul
letin was posted In the New York Cen
tral station saying that no more trains
were expected to arrive to-night. This
notice referred to both local and ex
press trains.
. Not a vessel of any kind has sailed
from or arrived at this port in more
. than twenty-four hours, and at the
'port of Boston only one arrival was re
â¢ pdrted, and that a coastwise steamer.
Two trans-Atlantic liners, the Ryn
dam, carrying the mails, and the Nord
America, have been unable to leave
their piers. Seven other steamships, all
scheduled to leave their piers during
the day, are still in port.
WORST STORM IN YEARS.
At Sandy Hook and at the quarantine
station the gale blew at the rate of
sixty miles an hour, and a number of
vessels are reported at anchor there.
The Atlantic Transport line steamship
Menominee from London, the Holland-
American line steamship Rotterdam
and the Fabre line steamship Germa
hla, all of which have been reported by
wireless, are In Sandy Hook Bay. A
dozen or more other steamships now
overdue have not been heard from.
This city, always susceptible to ab
normal weather conditions, is facing a
condition unequaled since that March
â¢ day years ago when it was cut off from
the rest of the world by a record snow.
' fall. The present storm began yester
day afternoon in a gentle way. As the
night came the wind increased, and by
midnight it was blowing half a gale
and drifting hard. At noon it was forty
miles an hour, and with It came a
heavy fall of snow and a temperature
that fell rapidly. The thermometer
then registered about 15 degrees. To
night the mercury went to about 10 de
grees at midnight, and the wind at that
time was blowing forty-eight miles an
hour. Less snow was falling than dur
ing the day, but It was still piling high.
All traffic on Long Island was sus
pended.

VESSELS BLOWN ASHORE.
Wrecks Line Atlantic Coast as Result
of Gale.
NORFOLK, Va., Jan. 25âThree
schooners were blown ashore In Hamp
ton Roads to-day by the fierce north
west storm which swept over the re
gion last night, accompanied by a fall
of snow. The John A. Russell of Tap
pahannock, Pa,, coal laden, was a
total loss, while the Lula and the oth
er, name unkndVn, were pulled into
deep water by tugs. A yawl from the
Lula is on the beach and it is thought
some of her crew tried to make shore
in the gale. If they did they were
drowned. Those on >ard the John A.
Russell were saved.
BALTIMORE, Jan. 25.âTwo steam
ers were blown ashore below Bodkins
"Point to-day. They are the British
steamship Lord Erne, from Baltimore
for Belfast, and the British steamship
â¢ Alswick Lodge, from Baltimore to Rot
' terdam. The Alswick Lodge was !
floated this afternoon and anchored j
near Bodkins Point. No report as to
xvhether either vessel is damaged has
reached here.
PORTLAND, Me., Jan. 25.âDuring a
hard snowstorm to-day the three
masted schooner Rodney Parker was
blown on the rocks Just outside of
the harbor. The captain and crew
' later left the vessel and were brought
to this city. The schooner probably
>vjll be a total loss. She was loaded
with granite.
PROVINCETOWN, Mass., Jan. 25.â
An unknown two-masted schooner was
blown on the bar at the upper end of
the harbor to-day. The seas are break- j
ing over her. It Is feared she may
sink.
. ATLANTIC CITY. N. J., Jan. 25.âA
" large steamship came ashore during j
the gale to-day on the shoals at Brig- ;
antine. Owing to the high wind and
blinding snow it was impossible for the
life saving to render aid.
COLD WAVE IN WIDE AREA.
Freezing Weather From Rockies to |
. . Alleghnnics.
. CHICAGO, Jan. 25.âPractically every
town in the Mississippi Valley and the
â¢ lake region had its weather troubles
to-day. In some places it was ex
tremely cold, in others it was less so.
but was snowing heavily, and In a [
great many others It was both cold and ;
snowing.
In this city the mercury, which was t
2 below zero last night, mounted this I
morning to 20 above. Then came the
snow and a gale from the north. In the
Outlying portions of the city street car
trafflo was badly hindered. The wind ;
died somewhat to-night and the snow
ceased, but the mercury is falling and j
it is predicted that it will be from 5 to !
10 degrees below zero before morninsr.
In Kansas and Western Missouri the
weather was the coldest recorded in '
the last five years. All through the I
Ohio Valley the weather was the cold
est of the winter, ranging from 8 de
grees above to 2 below. In the major
ity of cases the cold was accompanied
by a high wind and driving snow
that interfered seriously with railroad
traffic.
Reports from the South show that ;
the most severe weather of the winter
is prevailing In that section of the I
country. Mobile had a temperature
of 26 and New Orleans 30, and in both
places the mercury is still falling. At
Mobile a cold northwest wind drove so
much water out of the slips that many
ships were left aground. It is expected j
that all along the north coast of the
Gulf of Mexico the temperature to
night will approximate 12 degrees
above zero and that all exposed truck- j
age will be killed and much damage
done to fruit trees.
The extent of the cold wave can be
estimated by the statement that with
the exception of Helena, Mont., and
some points in the State of Texas,
there was not a city to-night between j
the Rocky Mountains and the Allegha-
Dies that reported a temperature as
high as the freezing point, and in all
places the mercury is falling to-night,
with the probability of being 10 to 12
degrees lower before morning.
FIREMEN INCASED IN ICE.
Fight Blaze During Terrific Storm in !
New York.
NEW YORK, Jan. 25.âWhile the
worst storm of. many winters howled
around them, a dozen fire companies j
under the personal direction of Chief j
Croker for eight hours to-day fought j
a stubborn fire in the Kips Bay Brew- !
cry at First avenue and Thirty-eighth j
street. All the men suffered intensely |
from long exposure to the chlllling I
blasts and five of them were more or j
less seriously hurt by being caught
beneath a falling wall.
The firemen worked under the most I
discouraging and trying conditions, i
Flying spray froze the moment it !
touched their garments and long be
fore the fire was controlled many of j
them resembled huge icicles. Chief j
Croker was obliged to discard his hel- j
met because of the accumulation of i
ice. The financial loss is placed at
ShOUt $150,000. â¢
MERCHANTS DISCUSS
MATTERS AT DINNER
The San Francisco Credit Men's As
sociation held a meeting and dinner
last evening at a well-known Pine
street restaurant, where, for several
hours, the members of the organiza
tion discussed numerous subjects of
interest to their respective business
enterprises.
President Gustav Brenner presided at
the dinner. Among the subjects that
came before the assemblage was the
bulk law, which was read by Sol Mag
ner and then thoroughly discussed by
B. T. Alexander, Alexander Bell and
Gustav Brenner.
W. H. Preston, first president of the
national association of credit men,
who recently returned from an East
ern trip, addressed his fellow mem
bers on the conditions existing among
the credit associations in the East and
compared the work of those organi
zations with the work of the local as
sociation. Walter Mansfield spoke of
the laws covering the fraudulent con
cealment of merchandise and of the
difficulties encountered by lawyers and
merchants in trying to enforce them.
The concluding speech of the evening
was delivered by Congressman Julius
Kahn.
SCHOONER MAHUKONA
IN DANGEROUS POSITION
ASTORIA, Ore., Jan. 25.âThe four
masted schooner Mahukona, in ballast
from San Pedro, lies almost ashore at
the mouth of the Columbia River at
the very edge of the seething breakers
which are pounding over the bar. She
is dragging her anchor. The crews
from the life-saving stations at Fort
Stevens and Fort Canby are in readi
ness to go to her assistance the mo
ment rockets are sent up. The power
ful bar tug Tatoosh is standing by,
but is powerless to render assistance.
The Mahukona came up to the bar late
to-day, but found a strong ebb tide
running.
She made an effort to put out to sea,
but was almost carried on the rocks at
Cape Disappointment by wind and tide.
As a last resource she was headed for
the mouth of the river and an attempt
to cross the bar was made.
The Mahukona wallowed through the
big breakers, but the tide finally com
pelled her to anchor within a few rods
of the bar. To add to her distress, the
wind has increased from twenty-five
miles an hour to forty and her anchors
are dragging.
The pilot of the Tatoosh believes If
the Mahukona can keep off the bar un
til midnight and if the wind blows no
harder he will be able to get a line
aboard her, but even in case that Is ac
complished he expresses faint hopes of
saving her.
ONE-MILE AUTO RECORD
BROKEN THREE TIMES
ORMOND, Fla., Jan. 25.âThe world's
mile record was broken three times at
the automobile ra*es to-day in spite of
the cold weather. Louis S. Ross in his
twenty horsepower car covered a mile
In 38 seconds flat, one second under the
world's record made by Vanderbllt in
his ninety horsepower car on the OrÂ»
mond-Daytonia beach one year ago.
Ross held the record but a short time.
Arthur E. McDonald in his ninety
horsepower crossed the mile tape in
34 2-5 seconds. Shortly afterward H.
L. Bowden In his 100 horsepower ma
chine covered a mile in 34 1-5 seconds.
The one-mll# international champion
ship for the Sir Thomas Dewar chal
lenge cup brought out a field of entries,
all the fast racers competing. In the
final Louis Ross in his twenty horse
power Teakettle won in 42 seconds. Ar
thur Mac Donald was second in 42 2-5
seconds, William Wallace third and
Barney Oldfleld last.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 26, 1905.
LODGE DEFENDS
GENERAL MILES
Sharp Debate in the Senate
on Tart of Army Bill Di
rected at Retired Officer
Â«
NO DECISION REACHED
â¦
Effort Made to Curtail Pay
of Men Who Take Service
With the National Guard
WASHINGTON, Jan. 25.â1n connec
tion wiih the consideration of the army
appropriation bill, there was an ani
mated discussion In the Senate to-day
of the assignment of General Miles to
service In charge of the Massachusetts
State militia.
The controversy was begun by Lodge,
who criticized In sharp language the
provision of the army bill prohibiting
the awarding of extra pay to retired
officers assigned to active service when
1t exceeds that of major on the ac
tive list. Lodge declared the provision
was directed at General Miles and was
most unfair. Lodge, Proctor, Piatt of
Connecticut, Spooner, Bailey, Patter
son. Carmack and Money took part In
the debate which followed. Spooner,
Piatt and Money contended that the
enactment would have the effect of
limiting the salaries of all retired of
ficers assigned to active duty to a ma
jor's pay regardless of rank. Spooner
contended that the paragraph was an
indirect effort to prevent the assign
ment to active service of officers and
denounced it as "cowardly."
Nelson said the real desire is to place
officers in a position to get not only
their full pay but also an additional
$2000 or $3000 from the States. "That is
the germ of the Senator's contention,"
he said, referring to Lodge.
The latter replied that General Miles
is getting no pay from Massachusetts;
that he had refused it.
Several amendments were suggested,
but action on them and on the provision
went over for the day.
In connection with the provision for
the support of a provisional regiment
of native troops In Porto Rico, Clay
called attention to the fact that Secre
tary Root had recommended the dis
continuance of that regiment. Proctor
replied that Root subsequently had
changed his mind and had urged the re
tention of the regiment.
GRIDLEY'S WIDOW A CLERK
AT THE AGE OF SIXTY
Relict of Date Naval Hero Asks Con
gress to Erect Monument to
His Memory.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 25. âSenator
Alger to-day introduced a bill appro
priating $5000 for the erection of a
monument to the memory of Captain j
C. W. Gridley, who commanded Ad
miral Dewey's flagship Olympia at
tbe battle of Manila Bay. In ;
tion with the presentation of the bin !
Alger had read a letter writen by ;
Mrs. Gridley to President Roosevelt. |
In this letter Mrs. Gridley stated i
that at 60 years of age she is working j
as a clerk in one of the executive
departments of Washington, and is |
financially unable to erect the monu
ment herself. She therefore asks the
President to exercise his influence for
the monument. She also mentions j
the death by accident of Captain Grid
ley's only son on the Missouri, and
suggests that the monument might be J
of a joint nature.
Smoot Case Near End.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 25. âThe in
vestigation of protests against Senator
Smoot, so far as the introduction of
testimony is concerned, was brought
to a close When the Senate
Committee on Privileges and Elections
convened, A. S. Worthington, counsel
for Senator Smoot, announced that
he would not DUt other witnesses on
the stand, and that he had nothing
further to offer.
Baker Assails the Tariff.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 25.âThe
House to-day passed the District of
Columbia and the Military Academy
appropriation bills. Except for a
speech by Baker of New York, bitter
ly assailing the protective tariff pol
icy of the Republican party, the pro
ceedings were devoid of interest.

I sentatlve Hughes of* New Jersey lntro
| duced a resolution In the House to-day
j directing the Committee on Judiciary
; "to inquire and report whether'the ac
' tion of this House Is requisite concern-
J Ing the official misconduct of John j
| Goodnow, Judge of the United Statei
Consular Court at Shanghai. China,
and to say whether the said Judge has j

tive Little's resolution, offered in the
House some time ago, providing for a
thorough Investigation of the steel
trust, was ordered favorably reported
at the meeting of the Judiciary Com
mittee to-day.
Representative Little's resolution is
similar to the resolution Introduced
last fall, asking for an Investigation of
the beef trust, which Investigation is
now under way In Chicago and other
Western cities. The resolution calls
upon the Secretary of Commerce and
Labor to take up the <york under the
law creating his department.
The resolution was amended in one
respect. The original directed that the
Secretary of Commerce and Labor re
port the result of his findings and any
recommendations he might deem wise
to the first session of the Fifty-ninth
Congress. This was amended to direct
that the Secretary report his findings
according to law, which means that he
must report direct to the President,
who can use his discretion about mak
ing the report public.
The bill directs that the following
facts be ascertained:
la the United States Steel Corpora
tion and its associated and constituent
companies engaged in commerce be
tween States and Territories or with
foreign countries, and, if so, to what
extent is the steel and iron industry
In the United States, Including the
output and prices of its products, con
trolled by said corporation and its as
sociated and constituent companies?
To what extent does the corporation
and its associates control the output
and prices of finished product made by
independent companies dependent upon
it for their raw material?
To what extent, if at all, does the
corporation or its associates sell Its
products more cheaply to its export
trade than it does to Its domestic con
sumers?
What conditions have resulted in
whole or in part from any contract,
combination or agreement in the na
ture of a trust or conspiracy in re
straint of commerce between the
States and Territories or between for
eign countries?

TRAINS CRASH
NEAR A SIDING
Owing to Fog Engineer Does
Not See Signal to Stop
and a Collision Follows
STOCKTON, Jan. 25. âA number of
persons hurt and a car thrown off the
track are the results of a train acci
dent on the Santa Fe this morning at
Blum, forty-five miles west of Stock
ton.
The injured: J. C. Hurle of Stockton,
superintendent of the Pacific Glass
Works, scalp wound; Johannes Reimers
of Stockton, landscape gardener for
the Santa Fe, cut on the face. A few
others suffered minor bruises.
F. Dohnken Sr. and wife and F.
Dehnken Jr. and wife of Antioch, con
ducting the Arlington Hotel, were bad
ly shaken up, and Conductor H. A.
Bankead of Kansas City, on a visit to
San Francisco, had his back badly
hurt. The injured people were brought
to Stockton and cared for. All were
able to proceed to their homes. Hurle
is probably the most painfully hurt and
had to be conveyed to his home in a
cab. It cannot be told yet whether his
injuries are serious.
The dense fog prevailing Is partly re
sponsible for the accident. No. 41, car
rying passengers for San Francisco,
left here at 9:20 this mornimg, No. 6
leaving San Francisco at 7:307 While
No. 41 was going on the siding at
Blum Engineer Deardorff of No. 6 con
tinued on, striking the rear coach of
No. 41. He thought No. 41 had cleared,
but he was deceived by the fog.
There will be an investigation to fix
the blame for the accident. The Santa
Fe officials here say there are mitigat
ing circumstances in Deardorff's favor.
A flag was to have stopped him at
Blum. He had no previous orders to
stop. In the fog, however, he did not
see the flag, evidently, and so ran by
the. station as No. 41 was taking the
siding. Had either train been ten sec
ons earlier a serious accident would
have resulted, though both trains were
siowing down at the time.

TAKES STAND
FOR HIMSELF
Youth Who Killed His Wife
.. Explains Causes Leading
to Commission of Murder
HIS ATTORNEY'S PLAN
Relies Upon a Plea of Emo
tional Insanity, Due to
Much Worry and Liquor
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 25. 1
: Interest in the trial of Lemuel
* D. Campbell, charged with the murder
of hi* wife, centered to-day in the de
fendant himself, who took the stand in
his own defense. He was led careful
ly oyer the ground of his troubles with
His wife as testified to by other wit
nesses, connecting and explaining their
testimony.
The murder and the circumstances
connected with it he is not supposed
to know anything about, and was not
. "asked. His attorney, ex-Judge Frick,
relies upon making out a case of emo
tional insanity, superinduced by men
tal worry by his wife's misdeeds and
aggravated by liquor, to clear his cli
ent, and does not believe that for the
week preceding the homicide he was
responsible.
â¢ Campbell himself made the most In
teresting witness that has been put on
â  the stand during the trial of the case.
His. answers were clear cut and
straightforward. His fight with J.
FossatL whom he knocked down for
taking His wife out one night, was ex
plained in detail. The state of his
mind on the night of the shooting has
been left to the Imagination of the
â¢Jury, except facts testified to by other
witnesses.
A, W. Anselmi, a butcher for whom
Campbell worked, has testified that
Campbell came to his shop about 7
o'clock on the night of the homicide
In an Intoxicated condition and had
with him a quart bottle of whisky. An
selmi was asked to take a drink, which
he refused. Campbell then took
a drink himself and put the bottle back
' into his pocket. Anselmi says that he
then told Campbell that his former
â¢wife had called him up twice and
wanted to see him. Campbell said he
â¢would go and see her. An hour later
he fled from the place her slayer.
Campbell's sister, Mrs. Romie Raf
ifeto, made a pathetic witness for her
. brother. She almost fainted on the
.stand, but held herself together long
enough to tell of a visit she received
from her brother's wife, on which oc
casion Mrs. Campbell had a big re
volver and said that she was going to
shoot him. She also had a call from
Mrs. Cutler, Mrs. Campbell's mother,
. who told her that she was after her
brother and would send him to San
Quentin if it took every cent she had.
Mrs. Klmer Kennedy, â  Campbell's
: mother, tord of the separation"/of the
pair and of his living at home, and
said that, seemingly, a state of peace
had been brought about when he be
gan to receive notes and messages from
. his former wife and she again involved
his life with her own.

POPULAR PROFESSOR AT UNI

WILL SINO THE "MIKADO."
BERKELEY, Jan. 25. âAn unex
pected impetus has been given to the
preparations qf the Prytanean Society
for the "Mikado" production by the an
nouncement that Professor Walter E.
Magee of the State University has
consented to assume the part of the
"Mikado" in the comic opera.
Professor Magee is at the head of
the physical culture department of the
university, a great favorite in his
classes and conceded to have one of
the finest voices among the amateur
singers of the university town. Of
striking presence, experience in stage
business and qualified in other ways
to score a hit in opera, Professor Ma
gee's wilrrngness to assist the Pry
tanean girls In their production has
added immensely to the "co-eds' " con
fidence in their ability to make a suc
cess of their stage venture.
The other principal parts in the opera
have not yet been assigned, as the try
outs have not progressed sufficiently to
give the coach and the committee in
charge an exact "line" on the capabili
ties of the candidates for places. There
are seventy candidates for places in the
production, twenty of whom are can
didates for principal parts,, and the* re
rnalp.fjer for places in the chorus.
The "Mikado" Is to raise funds for a
university bospital. The performance
for this object is to be given at the
Macdonough Theater in Oakland on
February 24.

Southern Pacific Official
Sends Welcome News to
Town Clerk of Berkeley
DEFINITE PROMISE MADE
Objectionable Feature to Be
Discontinued in One Week.
History of Negotiations
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Jan. 25.
Definite promise to move the obnox
ious freight yard in the center of
Berkeley's business section has been
made by the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company and. there is rejoicing in
Berkeley. Town Clerk Merrill to-day
received the following letter, signed by
Superintendent W. S. Palmer of the
company:
. Dear Sir: Answering your communication
of January 12 I beg leave to advise you that
on and after February 1. 1905, we will cease
to handle all freight at our station between
Center street. University, Shattuck and Stan
ford avenues.
The delay in making such arrangements has
been due to our desire to complete our plans
for improvement of our property at the In
tersection of Shattuck avenue and Adeline
street before handling all our local freight
trafffic at such solnt.
Regretting the delay In the change, I rpmaln.
W S PALMER, Superintendent.
The change promised by the railroad
corporation Is expected to greatly im
prove the appearance of East Berkeley.
The corporation has utilized the heart
of the town as a freight and passenger
yard for nearly thirty years. When the
town was small the freight yard was
considered a convenience. With growth
came the feeling that a freight yard in
the center of the city was not a thing
of beauty or an attraction of any sort.
Suggestions that the freight business
be done elsewhere were made by civic
bodies and the company consented a
year ago to make the change, though
up to this time the freight business has
continued to be in evidence at Shattuck
avenue and Center street.
The railroad company has proposed
to erect a $25,000 stone depot on Its
land, but no definite promise has been
given in regard to the time when work
on it is to begin.
YOUNG ELOPERS
ARE ARRESTED
Girl Wife of John Pat
ton of Sacramento Euns
Away With .Walter Boone
â  4
Oakland Office San Franclaco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 25.
The police to-night stopped the elope
ment of Mrs. Lillie Patton, the girl wife
of John Patton, a Sacramento iron
molder, and Walter Boone, a motorman
of the capital, who, after an acquain
tance of four months with the bride of
half a year, Induced her to run away
with him.
The pair were arrested to-night at
Sixteenth-street station while they
were on their way from Sacramento to
San Francisco on an evening tram.
Complaint had been made by Mrs. Sa
rah James, the young wife's mother, to
the authorities at Dixon, where Mrs.
Patton had been visiting. Constable D.
McKinnon telegraphed a warrant for
the arrest of the runaways and they
will be held until he arrives to take
them btfck. Mrs. Patton admitted to
night she was only 17 years old.
Her home before her marriage to
Patton seven months ago was with her
mother at Broderick, Yolo County.
After her wedding she went to Sacra
mento. There she became acquainted
with Boone, who is 2a years old. Mu
tual admiration led to frequent meet
ings and the final arrangement for
elopement. The girl left her husband a
few days ago and went to Dixon, os
tensibly to stay with relatives for a
short time.* That trip was only a blind
to deceive her spouse. In correspond
ence with Boone she agreed to meet
him on the evening train out of Sacra
mento. The plan failed to some extent,
for suspicions were aroused that all
was not right in the girl's sudden de
parture. Mrs. Janes was hastily sum
moned and took the steps that led to
the police Interference. Mrs. Patton
and her companion were indignant over
their arrest and protested at the outset
that it was all a mistake. Later they
told enough to warrant the police in
holding them. The young woman is a
buxom country girl far from unat

MAYOR HESITATES TO
REMOVE BOOTBLACKS
OAKLAND, Jan. 25.âMayor War
ren Olney has replied- to the request
of the Barbers' Union to remove all
bootblack stands from the sidewalks
by declaring that he has the subject
under consideration, but hesitates to
act on account of the many families
supported by owners of s\ich conveni
ences. In his letter to the union
Mayor Olney says:
It Is within the power of the Mayor to re
move them (bootblack atanda) from all public
streeta; the question la, shall he do It? Tbey
are a convenience to the public. An easy op
portunity to get a shine for a nickel Is an
encouragement to personal neatness. Cleanli
ness, you know. Is akin to godliness. That is
why public baths are maintained In many
cities. Then, again, to sweep these stands off
the sidewalks would deprive a large number
of people of their means of livelihood. It
might take bread from children's mouths. This
makes me hesitate. I shall consider the mat
ter more fully and should be glad to know
what the mind of the people Is on the sub
ject.

Rev. R. A. Walton' Arrives
in Oakland and Assists
General Local Committee
GOOD WORK IN DENVER
Earnest Effort Being Made
by 31embers of Protestant
Churches Across the Bay
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 25.
There was an important conference
of the pastors of Oakland this after
noon in the parlors of the First Presby
terian Church, when Rev. R. A. Wal
ton, one of the four evangelists who is
to conduct meetings here in March,
was present and outlined the plan the
evangelists should follow in their work.
There were present many clergymen of
the principal Protestant churches.
The plan of the committees now at
work here was gone over and approved.
The advertising committee was fur
ther instructed as to its duties, being
expected to use billboard posters, ban
ners and see to the distribution of
thousands of cards of invitation. The
music committee was asked to obtain
from each church a list of ten members
and train them for the choruses.
It was decided in view of the great
attendance "at other cities where the
evangelists have worked that it would
be necessary to hrve more meetings on
Sunday evenings than at first planned
and a meeting at Golden Gate and at
Twenty-third avenue was added to
the number. This will give ten meet
ings on each of the three Sunday
evenings. The need of renting at least
one of the theaters for Sunday after
noons and evenings was discussed and
considered favorably. Dr. Walton, in
an interview, said:
"In Denver, where Dr. Chapman is
working now with his assistants, there
has been marvelous work done."
Dr. Walton left on the evening train
from Denver for Los Angeles, where
the evangelists will hold meetings last
ing from January 27 to February 19.
At the close of the meeting of the
general committee there was a meeting
of the Central Oakland district. Each
pastor was asked to furnish Rev.
Charles R. Brown, the chairman, four
workersâone to secure singers, one to
select personal workers, one to act on
the finance committee and one on the
advertising committee.
Owing to the two principal meetings
being so close together, one in the First
Congregational Church jnd the other
in the First Presbyterian Church, It was
deemed best to say where the workers
and singers from fjhe churches In the
district were expected to co-operate,
and the following division was made:
For the First Congregational Church,
Rev. J. Wilber Chapman, evan
gelist; First Congregational, First
Christian, First Lutheran, First
Free Baptist. United Presbyte
rian, Fourth Congregational, United
Brethren, Thirty-fburth-street Meth
odist and Golden Gate Methodist
churches. For the First Presbyterian
Church meeting, Rev. Henry Ostrum
evangelist; First Presbyterian, First
Baptist, First Methodist, Oak Chapel
Congregational, Methodist Episcopal
South, Alden Presbyterian, Golden Gate
Baptist and Golden Gate Presbyterian.
The officers of the Central District
are: President#Rev. C. R. Brown; vice
pesldent. Rev. -H. J. Vosburgh; secre
tary, Rev. Paul Stewart.

JAILS CLIENT
TO TEST LAW
Scavengers' Attorney Makes
a Move to Get Hearing in
the State Supreme Court
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 25.
After failing to-day to induce Chief
of Police Hodgkins to stop the arresting
of scavengers charged with violating
the garbage collecting laws, Attorney
James H. Creely, for the scavengers,
caused the arrest of one of his clients
that the legal warfare that is on may
be taken into the Supreme Court at
once. Creely purposes to consent to
immediate conviction and sentence of
this self sacrificing scavenger, get im
uaediate hearing In the Superior Court
aTfirming the police oourt Judgment,
then hasten to the highest tribunal
with an application for a writ of
habeas corpus on behalf of the impris
oned man.
On thiÃ programme Creely says he
expects to get a decision touching the
validity of the ordinance under which
the arrests are being made. His point
is that the city had no right to grant
the Pacific Incinerating Company its
franchise to collect and destroy the
city's refuse.
The company's attorney, L. S.
Church, was apprised to-day of the
move, and in reply declared that he
would be glad to try conclusions with
Creely before the Supreme Court.
Church said he believed the activity
on the part of the scavengers was due
to the injunction proceedings that have
been taken by the incinerating com
pany before the Unit* States Circuit
Court,

and found the woman lying on the
hoor in a condition warranting small
hope of recovery. An instant call
brought a physician, who stitched the
wound with as much care aa though
the injury were but slight, and, to the
surprise of the physician, the nurse
and the patient herself, Mrs. Leien
decker has steadily Improved until
now she is able to be up.

WAS ECCENTRIC
"Witnesses Tell of Peculiar
Actions of the Pioneer
Whose Will Is Contested
DAUGHTER TAKES STAND
Mrs. Emily Dunn Says That
Her Father Once Chanted
Kock of Ages in a Theater
â¦
Further revelations of the eccentrici
ties of J. Alexander Yoell's character
were made in Judge Kerrigan's court
yesterday. John Farnham, formerly
Public Administrator of this city, oc
â¢cupied a room near the Santa Clara
pioneer when he passed away at High
land Springs.
..'According to Farnham the last words
'tittered by Yoell were startling to say
the least. "Jesus, dear Jesus," pleaded
â¢the old man In his last breath, "I can- j
â¢ not stand this any longer. I must get !
a drink of whisky." The strange re- j
quest was not fulfilled, for on the fol- !
.lowing- morning Yoell was found dead
in his bed.
Mrs. Emily F. Dunn, one of the dis
inherited children by Yoell's second
wife, gave a long account of her father s
peculiar actions. She declared that one j
night when she and her sister Gertrude
.were at the Grand Opera-house with i
their father he suddenly burst into
song. Despite their protests Yoell
ihanted "Rock of Ages" in a high key,
.disturbing the entire audience. Mr?.
Dunn related an incident that occurred
in the Yoell home at San Jose, which
was intended to show that the old
man's mind was clouded with wild sus
â¢pioions against the world in general.
Mrs, Dunn was talking to Mrs. James
de la Montanya when old Yoell came
lntd the room. Though up to that time
the pioneer had always greeted Mrs.
Montanya cordially and addressed her
by her first name, he refused to talk to
her then. "Afterward," Mrs. Dunn de
clared, "he accused me of plotting with
the guest."
F- W. Shroeder, proprietor of a resort I
in Monterey County, said that while
Yoell stopped at his resort the old
' man's conduct was decidedly irrational.
Shroeder said that Yoell disturbed the
guests of the place by alternately pray
. ing and rursing in a loud tone of voice.
Because of these disturbances Shroeder
was. forced to order Yoell from the
place.
. Mrs. Dunn said that after her father I
had held a consultation with Mrs. Eva- |
line Levy he changed entirely his attl- I
tude toward the rest of his children. |
Before that, she declared, she and her
father-had been on friendly terms.
The case will be resumed at 10:30 I
o'riorÂ«k this morning, when depositions:
taken in San Jose are expected to be
forthcoming.

. coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but I
fe-w realize its value when taken into
' the human system for the same cleans- |
ing'puroose.
. Charcoal is a remedy that the more
yon take of it the better; it is not a
.. drug at all, but simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present in
the ctornach and intestines and carries
' them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after eating j
' onfons and other odorous vegetables. I
'â¢ Charcoal effectually clears and im- j
proves the complexion, it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural and '
eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which !
collect in the stomach and bowels; it i
'. '.disinfects the mouth and throat from !
â¢ the poison of catarrh.
All .druggists sell charcoal In one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money j
is in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges: they
"are composed of the finest powdered
WJllow charcoal, and other harmless
antiseptics in tablet form or rather In ;
the form of large, pleasant tasting loz
enges, the charcoal being mixed with â¢
heney.
The daily use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much Improved condition !
of the general health, better complex- i
ion, sweeter breath and purer blood,
and the beauty of it is, that no possible
. harm can result from their continued ;
use. but on the contrary, great benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I ad- i
viae Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all I
patients suffering from gas in stom- i
ach and bowels, and to clear the com- !
plexion and purify the breath, mouth 'â¢
and throat; I also believe the HVer is 1
greatly benefited by the daily use of
them; they cost but 25 cents a box at
drug stores, and although in some sense
a patent preparation, yet I believe I j
get more and better charcoal in Stuart's
Charcoal Lozenges than in any of the
ordinary charcoal tablets."

TOUCHES COURT
GUSHING TEARS OF TWO
KEENANS WIN MERCY.
But Pat Must Serve Fifteen Days for Bombard
ing Workshop of His Brother John.
It was not the first appearance of the
Keenan brothers. Tat and John, before
Police Judge Cabaniss, and, as on each
of the preceding occasions, Pat was ac
cused of having disturbed the peace of
John, who makes and mends shoes at
303 Kentucky street. The court record
showed that for his first offense, black- |
ening John's eyes, Pat was sentenced j
to ten days' imprisonment, that he
wept himself clear of charge No. 2, j
smiting John's head with a stovelid, j
and that he obtained dismissal of ac- ;
cusation No. 3, wrecking John's work- ,
shop, by solemnly swearing to abstain |
from indulgence in intoxicating liquors ;
for a period of six months. He had !
stuck to his pledge just two weeks j
when he relapsed and again was ar
rested for bombarding John's place of
business.
Tears of contrition dripped from Pat's
nose as he begged for leniency. "If you
send me to Jail," he blubbered, "I'll
lose a job that has been promised me."
"I'm tired of your weeping and your
promises, Pat," said his Honor, "and
am thinking of putting you away and
assuring peace for your brother until
sixty days have come and gone."
Pat fairly bellowed his grief, and
John's eyes, too, seemed to be pained
by the court's declaration of intention.
It was apparently in deference to the
latter's state of feeling that the Judge
reduced the penalty to thirty days,
whereupon Pat emitted another wail
and John whispered across the bench,
"Judge, I wish you'd cut it down."
"Well, I'll make it fifteen days, and
that's final," was the response. Then
to the bailiff his Honor shouted: "Take
these lachrymose kinsmen away from
here, else their combined pleading is
likely to result In this court handing to
Pat $15 in cash instead of sentencing
him to fifteen days in jail."
Pat's departing cry was heavily laden
with anguish. John's tears were silent
ly shed.

As the violin virtuoso scrapes his soul
into the strings and brings it out in
convincing strains, so did Mtss Dollie
Wallace's attorney thunder his con
victions into the ears of the jury In
Judfre Mogan's court and compel a
verdtct of acquittal In the time con
sumed by polling the twelve good and
true members.
Miss Wallace was one of many wom
en charged with being inmates of a dis
orderly house on Jackson street, and as
the outcome of her trial was regarded
as the establishing of a precedent for
disposal of the others the attorney put
the best he had into his closing argu
ment. If there was one man without
sin on that panel, he said, would he be
so kind as to throw the first stone at
that defendant. Would the gentlemen
please remember that In the matter of
morals women are pretty much what
men make them? Was It necessary for
him to suggest that his client may have
been more sinned against than sinning?
Let not the occupants of that Jury box
cease to remember that they had moth
ersâmaybe sisters, wives, sweethearts.
But enough of sentiment. There was a
practical side to the case that should
not be overlooked. San Francisco Is no
village, but a metropolitan seaport,
with a material future so bright that
the mere thought of it was dazzling.
Was that future to be blighted by a
narrow communal spirit of Puritanism?
Was the growth to still greater great
ness of this queen city of the
Pacific to be hampered by the
Importation of blue laws? Are
the sailors, the soldiers, the men
from the valleys, the forests and
the mountains to be confronted on
every hand by legalized restrictions
when they come to San Francisco in
quest of recreation and incidentally to
spend their money? â¢ Noâa hundred
times no! One glance at the intelli
gence therein impaneled sufficed to
satisfy any observer of ordinary acu
men that its verdict would be not
guilty.

CODLIN MOTH'S
ENEMY THRIVES
Great News for Orchard Men
Is Fact That Imported
Parasite Is Doing Well
HAS A DEADLY RAPIER
In Arena of Glass It Is |
Seen to Stab Larva to
Death and Deposit Eggsj
Farmers and fruit growers will be in
terested in the Information that the
beneficial parasite imported into Cali
fornia for the extermination of the cod
lin moth is thriving in the ferry building
in this city. Daily Messrs. Ehrhorn and
Carnes of the State Horticultural Com
missioner's staff receive proof of this
highly significant statement. If the
parasite does as well in the open in or
chards when placed to perform the work
required as it is doing In the ferry
building millions of dollars will be add
ed to the value of the apple crops of
California in a very few years.
Some days ago the parasites began to
hatch quite numerously. In large glass
jars files of a peculiarly glossy luster
appeared, one after another, and soon
began to viciously attack sliced apples
that had been previously placed in the
jars. The apple was eaten, so say the
entomologists, solely because of the
drink its juice afforded. After a good
drink or two apiece of applejack the
flies started in upon their real workâ
the killing of worms that would turn
into codlin moths, and the depositing of
eggs in the bodies of the worms, which
would serve as food for the future
young of the parasite.
The transparent glass jars afforded
Messrs. Ehrhorn and Carnes rare op
portunities to watch the entire process.
They are devoted students of the nat
ural phenomena supplied for the in
struction. The parasite fly has long,
wiry legs of strength that would be un
suspected on a casual examination. It
also has a swordâthat is. the female
fly hasâand this thin, rapier-like point,
incredible as the fact may appear, is
sufficiently strong and is wielded with
enough vigor to perforate repeatedly
thick layers of apple tree bark and to
stab to death with repeated and rapid
wounds the worm that is directly un
derneath the bark.
This sword-like appendage is charged
with the eggs of the fly parasite. When
It wounds the worm to death It leaves
the eggs in the wounds to hatch. To
make all the experimental conditions
perfect the Horticultural Commissioner
had codlin moth worms brought to this
city In considerable quantities. He also
provided for the worms quantities of
apples, by the box, which the worms
promptly attacked, the apple being
their particular food. The worms paved
the way for future codlin moths, and so
the enemy of the apple and the enemy
of the codlin moth were produced in
the same room, under constant inspec
tion, and an insect tragedy was pre
meditatedly prepared for the pleasure
of any one who wished to watch the
minute gladiators in their arena of
glass.
Boughs from apple trees are also I
placed under glass. The bark on these
boughs has been so perforated that the
codlin moth worm crawls easily under
it. Then comes the fly parasite from
Europe and by marvelous instinct lo- |
cates the invisible worm from Watson- :
ville or other California point with un
erring certainty. Then follows the pro- !
cess of stabbing the worm to death, as
already described. The fly parasite has
been seen to stab several worms to
death, and In each the eggs of the fu
ture flies, to stab to death other worms j
and so cut off the supply of codlin
moths, have been deposited. In fact,
the insect tragedies seem to proceed in
an endless chain.
George Compere, who discovered the j
deadly enemy of the codlin moth in Eu
rope after twice circling the globe In
search of it, will be here soon. As soon I
as the weather is favorable the first
distribution of the codlin moth para
sites will be made. Compere will accom
pany the Horticultural Commissioner's
representatives to some orchard which
is determined to have about the same
conditions as the European orchard
where the parasites were discovered.
When the favorable surroundings are
thus provided nature is supposed to do
the remainder of the work, and not
only California, but all of horticultural
America, will look on with interest
based on financial as well as scientific
considerations. The success of the ex
periment will mean that the apple crop
of the United States will be doubled
from the same acreage In a few years
as soon as the parasite has had a chance
to become domesticated all over the
land.
BRENNAN NEED NOT TELL

jections to % other questions of the same

Estate Makes Bad Feeling
Between the Executors
There were more displays of ill feel
ing between the executors of the Thom
as J. Clunie estate at yesterday's hear
ing of Andrew J. Clunie's objections to
the accounts of Executors E. A. Bridg
ford and Burrell G. White.
Clunie declared that the affairs of the
estate were In shape to permit the
filing of a final account by the execu
tors at once. Judge Bridgford admit
ted the truth of the statement, but de
clared that he would not make the ac
count until it was guaranteed that Clu
nle would not contest the Jack Clunle
trust. "If he will elect now not to con
test the trust we will file a final account
within a week." said Bridgford.
This made Clunle angry. He demand
ed that the court order the executors
to file the final account forthwith, and
said that there was a difference be
tween an account and a petition for
distribution. "They have no right to
say that I must waive my rights as a
legatee."
Bridgford retorted: "I propose to
make Mr. Clunie elect what he will do
as to contesting this trust. We propose
to file a petition for partial distribution
to Jack Clunie and force him to show
his hand."
Judge Coffey declined to make the or
der requested by Mr. Clunie at this
time.
Clunie questioned Bridgford as to the
law books In the latter*s office, which
he claimed belonged to the Clunie es
tate and had not been returned in the
inventory. Judge Grant asked him why
he had not claimed the ownership be
fore the inventory was made. Clunie re
plied, "I did not want to accuse Bridg
ford of stealing the books. I was sensi
tive about hurting his feelings."
"You have outgrown that sensitive
ness," remarked Judge Coffey, and Mr.
Clunle admitted that he had.
While Clunie was examining Judge
Grant as to his fee of $8000. the latter
said that If it were not allowed by the
court as a charge against the execu
tors he would probably charge it
against the trustees of the estate.
"So you mean to get It anyway,"
shouted Clunie, "regardless of the de
cision of the court."
The hearing probably will be conclud
ed this afternoon.
VISIT OF BURGLARS TO
BARBER SHOP DISCOVERED
Police Make Investigation and Come
to Conclusion That Intention Was
to Rob Neighboring Saloon.
When the barber shop of William
Baron at O'Farrell street and Grant
avenue was ou'ened for business yes
terday morning there was evidence of
the fact that it had been visited by
burglars during the night A hole
had been bored in the front door to
enable the lock to be worked. The
police were notified and Detectives
Dinan and Wren were detailed on the
case.
As nothing had been taken from the
barber shop the officers made a thor
ough Investigation of the premises
and came to the conclusion that the
hole in .the door had been made from
the Inside. The shop is under Caley
& Roeder's saloon and it is the the
ory 'of the officers that the burglars
had been in the saloon and had gone
to the basement, opening the door
leading from the shop to the saloon
with a skeleton key. Their Intention
had been to hide in the shop till the
saloon closed at 3 o'clock in the
morning and then rob it. A Chinese
who sleeps in the saloon commences
work as soon as it iss closed and his
reappearance disconcerted the burg
lars and they made their escape
through the front door of the barber
shop. _

THEATRICAL. STAR WHO WILL.
MAKE HIS FIRST APPEARANCE
HERE IN "THE DICTATOR"
The first appearance here of William
Collier since he became a star under
the direction of Charles Frohman is
announced for two weeks, commencing
January 30, at the Columbia Theater.
He will present the farce "The Dicta
tor," written by Richard Harding Da
vis, the author of many successful
plays and books. Most excellent re
ports of the success that Mr. Collier
has met with In this play have reached
this city; it is said to suit him better
than any In which he has appeared. It
has been described as being excruciat
ingly funny and to create Incessant
laughter.
The subject deals with the peculiar
methods used In the Central American
republics. It is a satire on the upris
ings and revolutions, which are almost
a dally occurrence, and the trials and
tribulations of the American Consul.
Mr. Collier seems to have made a grand
start under the direction of Charles
Frohman, "The Dictator" having been
seen for five months- at the Criterion
Theater, New York, in a very prosper
ous engagement.

TO COMPROMISE
SUIT FOR GRAIN
Attorneys in the Bank Case
Draw Agreement for Di
vision of Eppinger Assets
CLIENTS WILL DECIDE
If Plan Is Accepted Long
Legal Controversy Among
Creditors Will Be at End
An agreement out of court for a di
vision of the $102,000 received from the
sale of the remnant of the Eppinger
grain will probably be made by the
claimants In a day or two. Yesterday
during the progress of the trial in
Judge Murasky's court of the suit be
tween the banks to determine the own
ership of the grain Attorney Powers,
representing the Nevada Bank, sug
gested that the seventeen lawyers pres
ent take a few minutes to discuss a
compromise. They retired to the Jury
room adjoining the court, and after the
scaling down of various demands prac
tically agreed upon a scheme of distri
bution which will be at once submitted
to their clients. In the meantime the
trial was continued until next Tuesday,
when the settlement, if made, will be re
ported to the court.
The attorneys declined to state the
respective amounts to be given the
claimants, but said that there would be
three classes of creditors âthose who
hold warehouse receipts for lots of
grain that have been identified, those
who hold warehouse receipts but have
no grain to show for them, and, third,
the Eppinger trustee In bankruptcy,
who will distribute his share for the
benefit of all the Eppinger creditors.
It was learned that the largest allow
ance to a bank claiming specific lots
of grain was $12,000 to the American
National. The Bank of Monterey was
given $4400, Wells-Fargo $4000 and the
Bank of Yolo $3000. The other figures
were not divulged.

the warehouse at Crockett, was again

FEDERAL HELP FOR THE RIVERS.
THE plan of the engineers for the rectification of the Sacramento
River, and incidentally to keep its floods out of the San Joaquin,
looks to a contribution by the Federal Government. AÂ«Jhe
plan highly concerns the navigability of a meandered stream which
is by law under Federal jurisdiction, the assistance of the Federal
(iovernment seems to be a matter of course. If the cost of the worÂ«v
is divided between the State and the United States, the solution be
comes easy. If. however, it is all to fall upon the State, the end is
put afar off. Fur several years past we have commented upon tiie
small appropriations for our rivers in the river and harbor bill,
they have not suffice.! to properly discharge the Federal obligation
to keep the streams in a navigable condition. Snags and sandbars
have been left without attention, and these waterways, so necessary
as a check upon transportation charges, have been permitted to de
teriorate in respect to navigability.
There is no doubt that the plan of the engineers for the Sac
ramento will bring it into a state of the highest efficiency as a
navigable stream. When that plan is worked out we may expect
again what was a familiar sight in other days, when ocean ships tied
to the landing in Sacramento. The levees proposed will restore the
old' channel and purge the river of accumulated silt. But all this
restoration of navigation cannot fairly be left to California. The ,
levees will do a continuous work for navigation, with but little fur-;
iher assistance, that the Federal Government could not do by the ;
sporadic expenditure of many more millions than would be its share
of this permanent work. In the division of the cost it will be seen
that the State does that fair share which carries with it protection
against floods and reclamation of land for tillage. This the State
should do and expects to do. It will get every dollar back finally
by the addition of a great area of land to the taxable objects of the
State. It will get it back, too, in the increase in our producing popu
lation. People make a State. If the State is willing to do this, its
fair share of the work, the Federal Government should do its duty on
this meandered stream. The permanent navigability of the Sec
rarnento is under the same head as the building of an isthmian canal.
The two differ in degree only and not in kind. All waterways for
transportation have the same function of regulation and convenience.
The obligation of the United States in the case of the Sacramento
is older than that to the canal.
The Mississippi is leveed and controlled exclusively at Federal
cost. It is done on the theory that the work is for navigation and
the United States must do it. Yet that work is of equal importance
as a reclamation process, which makes millions of acres of land avail
able for the benefit of the States in which it lies. They get the benefit
;'at Federal expense. California pays her share, according to the
" sum total of her Federal taxes, toward this reclamation work on that
stream. In this way she must have a large sum to her credit, which
the States affected by the Mississippi floods owe to her. They should
support the proposition to share the cost of rectifying the Sacra
mento with the Federal Government.
To obtain this certain preliminaries are necessary. The Federal
Government makes appropriations upon the reports of its own en
gineers. The engineers employed by the State have reported their
plan, which is satisfactory to the State. But if it were the only
possible plan and all others were barred in the nature of things, the
United States would not accept without confirmation by its own
engineers. Before the present session of Congress our members, in
a meeting, agreed to solidly support Federal help in effecting this
plan. They determined to "make it a special issue in the next Con
gress and to use all of their power over other questions to force it to
the front and to success. It was expected, therefore, that the matter
would wait till the meeting of the Fifty-ninth Congress next De
cember. But our members are not losing any time, and Mr. Mc-
Lachlan has inserted in the river and harbor bill a provision that a
commission of Federal engineers shall be appointed to go over the
â¢ Sacramento River problem and make report to the next session for
action.
It will be seen that this advances the matter one year and per
haps two. It secures more prompt attention by Congress than was
hoped for, and it makes necessary more prompt action by the State
than has been expected. The Legislature will not meet again until
1007, while the prospect is that the Federal Government will be ready
for co-operation in 1906. Xo time should be lost, and especially
should the State avoid losing any. The present session of the Leg
islature should take this matter up and decide now whether the
State will help and how. If it be by direct appropriation, to be sup
plied by taxation, the amount to be used in each fiscal year should
â¢be decided upon. If it be by an issue of bonds, that should be set
tled, in order that it may go to the people. The attitude of the
State should be known and its permanent policy decided upon. Lack
ing this it is useless to expect that the Federal Government will take
the initiative. That belongs to California.
The Legislature is doubtless absorbed in many important mat
ters, but it should not in their exclusive contemplation forget this.
For a year the State has been actively preparing to have something
clone for the river. Our people were appalled by the flood disasters
â¢* of. last spring. They were the sole break in the year's happiness and
. prosperity. They caused the loss of millions and suspended, for the
time being, the production of some of our most important export
specialties. So critical was the situation that antagonism between
. rivers and cities ceased and the people of the valleys and the delta
came together to do something. That effort culminated in the report
of the engineers. Shall it stop there?
It is for the Legislature to say. That body represents the peo
ple, and if it do nothing in the premises, then the people can do
nothing and Congress will do nothing, and matters remain as they
. are. only we will be a little worse off and much farther away from a
settlement, because we did wake up, get a plan, and then lapse into
indifference. This Legislature should not adjourn without putting
the State in position to co-operate with-the United States.
AGAIN the fight is on over the army canteen. Army officers as
a rule favor its restoration. It was the service men's club. It
furnished a decent place of resort, built up a regimental li
brary, afforded a comfortable reading room, and gave enlisted men
an opportunity for reasonable pleasure and amusement, away from
vicious surroundings and temptations. But all this was denounced by
outside reformers. The use of light beers and wines in the canteen
â¢was decided by those who use neither as creating an appetite for the
fiery and rebellious liquors that cause murder and riot, and the can
teen went down before the onslaught of a theory.
Then arose again the fringe of low deadfalls around every army
post. The wholesome regimental club, books, reading rooms and
reasonable pleasure gave way to the dirty dive, the poison liquor, the
vicious associations of the wickedest form of drinking place. The
enlisted men as a result have suffered in health, morals and discipline.
Under these circumstances the army petitions for a restoration of
the canteen, believing that if restored the fringe of deadfalls will
disappear as it did before. .But restoration is actively resisted. Those
who oppose it propose no means for getting rid of the deadfalls, ex- j
cept as part of a general programme for total prohibition. This
means that whole generations of our soldiers are to be the victims of
vice, while the army waits upon the success of an impossible policy.
The spirit of reform is good, and deserving of all praise, and
even those who dream of the impossible are entitled to respect. But
common sense and the philosophical estimate of human nature as it
is are praiseworthy also, and their use in discussing this question will
be found quite valuable.
Now that science has made It possible to produce light out of rubbish the
Hrculation of the Congressional Record will increase "by leaps and bounds."â

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY. JANUARY .26, 1905.
THE KEEPER'S DAUGHTER
P\OR six days the thermometer had
soaring - at almost midsum-
heat, softening the ice of the
Great South Bay until nearly all
its cohesive power was gone. Now the
ice was a thick, spongy mass, so rot
ten that even the foot of a life-saver
pressing upon it firmly would break
through at many places. It was Im
possible either for foot passage or for
a boat to be forced through. And to
increase the seriousness of the case
the last two days had brought a fog
so gray and dense as to shut Fire Isl
and from every object a dozen yards
away.
Out In the channel toward the Long
Island shore, and on the ocean side,
currents had kept the ice from freez
ing thickly, and had hastened the de
composition. Already the delayed
shipping was seeking passage toward
New York or the open sea, and in the
fog and the narrow channels that
were free from ice was meeting with
disaster. From time to time signals
of distress came from one direction
or another, and so far as they were
able the life-saving stations of Fire
Island responded.
Perhaps at no other place in the
world could assistance have been ren
dered across that barrier of slush Ice,
in which spaces of open water were
beginning to appear; but then at no
other place in the world perhaps were
there amphibious scooters.
Several of these unique distinctions
of Fire Island were lying on the edge
of the ice. with pike and scooter
ing iron and oars across the thwarts
ready for Instant use, while their
owners leaned forward, listening,
peering, and. for the most part, shak
ing their heads. The wind was rising,
blowing straight from the sea. In
another hour it was likely to freshen
into a gale. Before it the gray fog
was being swirled and tossed and ed
died, but still encompassing and
denseâa huge wet blanket that
seemed writhing in the agonies of
pain.
On all sides were the sounds of fog
and danger, bell buoys, boat whistles,
occasional fog horns, the pounding
and crushing of ice where some ves
sel was forcing Its way through, and
now and then the ominous signal of
distress and call for help. Among
these came a sudden dull booming,
toward the sea and evidently at con
siderable distance. The men who
were in looked at each other, their
faces paling.
"A big ship," one of them said,
"and on the bar. Lord help 'em!"
"Yes," assented the man nearest
him, "nothing can get to 'em that far
out, not even scooters."
There was a peculiar grinding sound
near them. A scooter slid up the
beach and a man sprang out.
"The other fellows in yet?" he
asked.
"Only Carey. He brought a man

VALUE OF SENTIMENT IN MARRIED LIFE
Wk HAVE received a letter which I
Ws am particularly glad to answer.
1Â£ for its subjectâthe value of senti
ment in married life âis one which in
terests me deeply.
"Who makes the better wife," asks
the correspondent, "the woman of
brains or the woman of sentiment?
Should sentiment predominate in a
woman's nature if she Is amiable?"
Of course, there Is no cut and dried
rule for congeniality. Some authori
ties would have us believe that invari
ably blondes should wed brunettes,
that persons of phlegmatic tempera
ment should marry those who are
mercurial or sanguine, etc., ad In
finitum. For every one of these rules
there is a small army of exceptions
which might either prove or refute
their validity, according to one's preju
dices.
All you can sensibly say In regard to
the matter is that a girl who would
make an ideal wife for this man would
find marriage a complete failure if
wedded to that one. And amiability,
which always is numbered rightly
among the blessed, humbler virtues, is
quite as liable to ruin a home as ill
temper is, if it is the expression of
weakness and not of strength.
The woman who has brains and no
sentiment, and the woman who has
sentiment and no brains, are both
matrimonial misfits. For either one of
them to go into a life work where the
heart must speak a high language is
a mistake which society la certain to
j find out If they themselves fail to
do so.
The woman of brains need not be a
woman without sentiment A genuine
education develops the sensibilities as
well aa the Intellect It simply pro
duces a fine Inner balance. The dan

"Oh, Mr. Bowman:" The call was
clear and peremptory. Jack Bowman
paused, with one foot in the scooter, his
face growing set. The owner of the
voice was the keeper's daughter, ana
only the day before she had closed the
door into a future which he had begun
to believe would be his. The sentence,
I "I shall never marry a man whose fu
ture is bounded by his clam hoe and
fish trawl; the world has use for brave
deeds," still rang in his ears.
"What is it. Miss Blanche?" he asked,
trying to keep his voice calm. "I am
lin a hurry."
"Father says for no one to answer
that call just yet. He thinks this wind
will soon break up the ice so the life
| boat can go out. He says it will be sui
cide to attempt scooting through this
fog. Mr. Bowman!" her voice rising
in sudden displeasure, for the scooter
ist had stepped into his craft and
thrown out his pike to shove her into
Uie wind.
"I'm sorry, Miss Blanche," over his
shoulder, "but the keeper's orders are
j for his own men and not for a poor
> outside fisherman like me. Besides, the
: boat may be in 6ore need, and though a
' little scooter cannot do much, it may
jat least carry intelligence and perhaps
j save one or two âprovided 1 can reach

The girl's face underwent a sudden
! change, and she took an impetuous step
'â  forward, but already the scooter had
slipped away into the fog.
As they waited there, listening, peer
ing, while the hours dragged by, the
faces of the men showed something of
what they knew to be taking place
; within the fearsome, shifting pall of
mist. The scooter was rushing on,
! dropping into open spaces of water,
| slipping up again upon patches of rot
j ten ice, swiftly, with scarcely any
! checking of speed, its owner knowing
i time was of more importance than cau
i tion. Any moment its nose was liable
jto strike some obstruction and throw
| out its occupant, the wind at that
; speed might overturn the scooter or a
I sudden jibing wreck it without an mi
i stant's warning, either of which on the
j waste of rotten ice held but one possi
! ble fate for the owner,
j Two hours and there came another
i signal of distress close in shore. The
i waiting life-savers dropped into their
j scooters and slid out into the fog. The
, girl was still there, watching, her face
\ white. Ten minutes more and a scoo
i ter's nose suddenly slipped from the
darkness, almost at her feet, and Jack
I Bowman sprang out. Bending over, he
; lifted a recumbent figure from the
; scooter to the sand.
"Will you call some one from the sta
tion to carry this man up, Miss
: Blanche," he said hurriedly, as he
, swung his craft back into the wind. "I
! haven't time. There are others waiting
i for me."
The girl moved forward swiftly, plac
ing a hand upon his shoulder.
"I shall be waiting, too, Jack," she
! said in a low voice. "You must come
| back to me."
I A tremor went through the man's
frame, but he did not pause an instant
in his work. As the craft disappeared
in the fog his voice rose strong and res

we have seen many others who had
more brains than she who made as
foolish a figure.
Sentiment Is nothing: but Insight of
the finer kind. Behind it is the eye
which sees, the heart which under
stands, the hopefulness which inspires,
the brain which acts. Sentimentality
Is quite another thing. It is a dressed
up jackdaw. If is not the real thing;
and, what is more, it does not look so.
Sometimes you find in a woman's life
a curious mixture of sentiment and
sentimentality. You gain the impres
sion that an honest affection Is making
the social error of wearing in the sun
light clothes which are too dressy for
the daytime.
There Is one little woman I know who
is as good as expect to find,
and her dally acts show the sweetest
devotion to her family. But she is too
superlatively sweet. In her presence
her husband Is certainly not a happy
man. There is something so helplessly
protesting about his attitude toward
her elaborate endearments that he al
ways makes me think of a fly caught in
syrup. i
Octave Thanet publishes In one of
the December magazines a story, "The
Angel of His Youth," which gives an
effective contrast between a strong wo- j
man with sentiment and a weak wo
man of sentiment. The former she de
scribes as a thoroughbred, who would
run until she dropped, and run with
spirit. So I feel Justified In defining the
second type she portrays aa a truck
horse from the livery stable.
Certainly we love the heart woman
better than we love the brain womanâ
"white roses please leas than red." But
in picking out a wife I would, if I were
a man, seek for a woman with brains,
who had yet tenderness In her heart for
little children and sentiment enough to
appreciate the full meaning of the
words "love" and "home."

OF A MIDDAY PRAYER
BISHOP NICHOLS OPENS CHURCH CONVENTION
_. * . j- â
â¢Russia's internal difficulties were
not forgotten by the Protestant Epis
copal church yesterday, when at the
'deliberations of the fifty-flfth conven
tion at Grace Church Bishop Nichols
offered up a prayer at the midday de
votional exercise asking that in the
land where so much trouble exists
peace might be speedily restored.
. It was a day of hard work and many
accomplishments and foremost in the
rank of important achievements was
the adoption of a canon which has
made the "House of Churchwomen" a
â¢fact.
The canon passed with one or two
minor amendments and without dis
sent or argument. The adoption of
the canon places the women of the
church in a position where their in
defatigable labors will be more â¢promi
nently brought before the church
l>cdy. They will have power, subject
at all times to the constitution and
canons of the diocese, to legislate for
the conduct of woman's work in the
church and to act in an advisory ca
pacity upon such matters as the con
vention may from time to time sub
mit for an opinion.
The decision will be received with
the utmost interest throughout the
United States, Canada and England.
Another matter of importance con
sidered was the church journal, the
Pacific Churchman, about which the
Rev. Mardon D. Wilson gave a glow
ing account. The paper is on sure
ground, said Dr. Wilson, it is out of
debt and the prospect is that it will
embrace and represent the whole of
' the Pacific Coast, thus making it an
official organ In a wide sense.
AN EPISCOPAL RESIDENCE.
The report of the committee on
Episcopal residence gave the Rev. Mr.
Gallwey the opportunity to speak on
the subject as one of the committee
men. Never had he received a re
fusal when he had placed the matter
or finance before the men of the dio
cese, but all were eager to contribute
freely toward the building. Indeed, he
said, all those he had approached ex
pressed surprise that the residence had
not become an accomplished fact long
ago.
. Mr. Gallwey desired it to go on rec
ord that in every instance the commit
tee had been most cordially welcomed
and the response had been equally cor
dial.
Dr. Clampett congratulated Mr. Gall
wey on the hearty enthusiasm he
evinced in the matter and by a unani
mous vote both he and Mr. Gallwey
were placed on the general committee
on the residence.
. Chancellor A. N. Drown informed
Bishop Nichols that proper steps are
being taken to observe the fifteenth an
niversary of the Bishop's episcopate.
In reply Bishop Nichols feelingly
thanked the chancellor and the conven
tion and expressed his desire that if
there should be a recognition of the
anniversary that it might not be a for
mal observance.
A committee composed of the follow
ing was appointed to arrange for the
observance of the fifteenth anniversary
of the Bishop's episcopate: Archdea
con Emery, the Rev. D. O. Kelley, the
Rev. Dr. Bakewell, Chancellor Drown,
W. H. Crocker and Robert Bruce.
In connection with the cathedral
lands in Washington it was resolved
that the convention advocates the pas
sage of a bill now pending in Congress
"for the extension and improving of
.Massachusetts and Boundary avenues.
Northwest," in Washington, D. C.
CHURCH'S FINANCES.
The principle of apportionment was
introduced by W. A. M. Van Bokkelen,
â¢treasurer of the diocese, and the mis
sionary meeting was one of the most
interesting kind. Reports showed that
everywhere In the diocese the labor
expended in the cause of church ex
tension was meeting with strong re
sults.
Van Bokkelen reported as follows:
The diocesan corporation having charge of
several of the Invited or permanent funds
of the diocese concluded to unite them for in
vestment purposes. In this way each fund
hat, an" Interest in a greater variety of secu
rities. The investment of the tund is In
charge of three gtntlemen In close touch with
large financial transactions. It requires the
unanimous approval of the three to make or
change any of the investments and then only
,in giltedge securities.
In the management the rule has beÂ«n to
build up a reserve tund to provide for liquida
tion of the premium paid in purchasing of
securities and to provide against any danger
of unexpected calamity to any security held.
The Invested funds are steadily growing
from year to year, having nearly doubled
in the last six years. This, Independent of
large gifts to Institution*, which do not report
to the convention, but which are church In
stitutions and indirectly under control of
ecclesiastical authorities.
The diocese and all Its funds were never
in such a sound and satisfactory condition as
to-day.
The Rev. Mr. Gardner, chaplain of
Stanford University, read a report of
the state of the church, and the Rev.
Mr. Parsons, rector of St. Mark's
Church, Berkeley, read the report of
the Sunday School Commission. Mr.
Gardner presented a petition from
W. S. Dike, secretary of the National
Divorce Reform League, Washington,
D. C, asking the convention to unite
in a petition to Congress, that statis
tics on the subject of marriage and
GRAPE-NUTS.
MIGHT HAVE SAVED IT.
A Lot of Trouble From Too Much
Starchy Food.
A little boy of eight years whose
parents did not feed him on the right
kind of food was always nervous and
suffered from a weak condition of the
stomach and bowels. Finally he was
taken down with appendicitis and af
ter the operation the doctor, knowing
that his intestinal digestion was very
weak, put him on Grape-Nuts twice
a day.
He rapidly recovered and about two
months thereafter, his father states,
"He has grown to be strong, muscu
lar and sleeps soundly, weighs sixty
â¢ two pounds and his whole system is in
a fine condition of health." Name giv
en by Postum Co., Battle Creek, Mich.
" It is plain that If he had been put
on Grape-Nuts at an earlier period in
. his life, and kept from the use of
foods that he could not digest, he
never would have had appendicitis.
That disease is caused by undigested
â¢ food decaying in the stomach and
bowels, causing irritation and making
for the growth of all kinds of mi
crobes, setting up a diseased condition
which is the active cause of appendi
citis, and this is more marked with
people who do not properly digest
white bread.
Grape-Nuts is made of the selected
parts of wheat and barley and by the
peculiar process of the cooking at
the factory all of the starch is turned
â¢ into sugar ready for immediate diges
tion and the more perfect nourishment
of- all parts of the body, particularly
the brain and nerve centers.

The convention acquiesced In the
request.
BOARD OF MISSIONS.
The election of the diocesan board
of missions resulted as follows:
Clerical membera âRev. E. Bradley. Rev. C.
Macon, Rev. C. T. Walkley. Lay membersâ
Francis Avery. Robert Bruce, George E. But
ler, G. H. Kellogg.
Mr. Drown was reappointed chan
cellor, and the Rev. Mr. Brewer was
chosen registrar.
W. A. M. Van Bokkelen was elected
a member of the corporation of the
Diocese of California.
The committee appointed to inter
est the religious organizations of the
State in an effort to memorialize
Congress to legislate in the matter of
marriage and divorce reported that
it had written to the principal denom
inations in the State, but that no in
terest on their part could be aroused.
The committee recommended that It
be discharged, but that the convention
use its best wisdom devising some
method of arousing the Christian
sentiment of the State to grapple with
the evil. The recommendation was
adopted.
Business of the convention will be
resumed at Grace Church at 9 o'clock
this morning, and at 8 to-night the
Bishop and Mrs. Nichpls will hold
a reception under the auspices of the
Church Club, in the SL Francis
Hotel.
To-morrow morning Woman's Aux
iliary day will be observed at St.
Luke's Church, Van Ness and Clay
streets. At 11 o'clock in the morning
there will be holy communion, the
Bishop being celebrant.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 26, 1905.
BERLINDI SINGS
"ZAZA" AND IS
WELL RECEIVED
All conditions conformed to make a
great success for Signorina Berlindl in
"Zaza" last evening at the Tivoli. If
the entire range of operatic composi
tion, which is certainly extensive, were
to be considered, it is doubtful if there
is any work that surpasses "Zaza" in
the opportunities that it affords for the
compass of the Berlindi voice and the
Berlindi dramatic ability to And ex
pression. Then there was Polacco, con
ducting the insinuating music of Leon
cavallo, the sensuous, persisting,
climax-reaching, cumulatively affect
ing music that grieves in the strings,
warbles in the wood, wind and French
horns and is like a heartbreak in the
harp. Polacco conducted and In that
there is a partial essay on the theme
of why Berlindi succeeded.
Add to this that the audience was
perfectly in sympathy with the star of
the evening; that she did not have to
wring reluctant "bravas" from her
auditors, but that the applause was
spontaneous and electric and included,
with Berlindi, her principal associate*
in the cast. The audience rewarded,
with discriminating Judgment, the
splendid work of Polacco when he per
formed hiÃ task with perfection.
Berlindi, for her part, was deliriously
happy over . the reception that her
singing and acting received. She made
no attempt to conceal the joy that now,
naturally enough, was hers after the
somewhat disappointing experiences
that she has had at times. Not only
the audience, but Polacco and the en
tire orchestra, at the end of the third
act, were applauding her enthusiastic
ally and long. The close of each act
was followed by repeated curtain calls.
Not even Tetrazzini on a "Lucia" night
has created a greater* whirlwind of ap
proval. It was Berlindi's night.
The voice of the dramatic soprano
was In excellent fettle. It was evident
In the beginning that she Intended not
to spare either her voice or her efforts
in the dramatic way to score in the
affections of her auditors. There were
tew solecisms to detract from her dra
matic work, which was frequently
marked with Intensity. There could
not justly be any cavil concerning the
full use that she made of her voice. It
was enough when the full orchestra
produced its largest volume of tone. It
climbed above the accompanying tune
ful din and balanced it In bulk. Had
Berlindl sung first In "Zaza" in this
city her fame would already have been
greater than It is. The performance of
last night will undoubtedly give her a
strong hold on future audiences In this
city.
This measure of commendation does
not recant anything that has been said
heretofore concerning the Berlindl
singing in other operas. The preceding

DE PACHMANN
RENDERS MUSIC
WORTH HEARING
Awful press reports had reached ona
about De Pachmann. No longer, said !
these, did the pianist pat his audience
on the back when good and say things
when they were not. No longer, they
said, did he wink at you not to miss
the shower of pearls he would be
throwing, or pull your ear down to a
beloved phrase. No longer, in short,
did De Pachmann play showman to his
Chopin, and one was lamenting.
It was a respectable not buoyant au
dience fn consequence that met him at
the Alhambra last night. Chopin we |
were there for, the finest Chopin made,
and we were going to get it. But the
comedian of the piano, the man that j
is his own best audience and wants, !
oh so hard! to help you there, we were
secretly regretting. We had heard,
oh yes! that De Pachmann no longer
played the farceur at the piano. How
nice that was going to be! âaside; how
stupid! It was so MUCH better that
he should leave us free to enjoy after
our own fashion, wasn't it? ânot it!
We wondered it it were not too good
to be true."
It was, that is, it was -not true. It
took only M. de Paehmann'a three
friendly bows and expansive smile as
he came on lo proclaim nun the same
old De Pachmann us ever. True, he
kept ma where they belong
through most ot the Mozart .fantasia,
that the programme. Three
limes, however, tempted uy an auor
able modulation, a inciting chord or
two, a tasciiiuii.it; change ot rhythm,
he looked o\ei at us to ask iÂ£ we Had
noticed, "tiuie, I'apa de I'acnmann,"
some of us nodded oacK, uoih oi us
at home and content, .tie gave next
the tieethoven rvunoo Capncctoso in G.
with more enjoyment for himself and
us. And then, as encore, came the
first taste oi the Chopin, the G flat
major etude (.the first).
It seems a pity that De Pachmaun
should bother with anything outside of
Chopin, lie was in the Mozart Fanta
sia, in comparison, as one speaking a
foreign tongue, tiis phrase had a for
eign air, his ih> thm even a conscious,
posed sound, and lovely as the thing
was it was Mozart through the eyes
of a gifted, gracious alien.
But what a change when comes
Chopin! It is then a Siamese sym
pathy. One does not know where to
begin on De Pachmaun s perfections
here. Possibly what will first strike a
pianist about De Pachmaun is his tone.
"Velvet," so oft< n used, so seldom de- |
served, best describes it to me. There
Is never a hint of harshness, hardness,
dryness, throughout its whole length |
and breadth. It is deep, soft, juicy; i
mellow in its snappiest staccato, round ;
in its tiniest pianissimo. That pianis- j
simo! You have to listen for it with
the ears of your soul âthe gods only
know how M. de Pachmaun's oortlv
little hands evolve it. Herein lies his
distinguishing virtuosity.
But one thinks of nothing less than
the virtuoso when De Pachmann plays.
You think of him no more than the
pianist does. You think of Chopin and
De Pachmann, and he thinks of Chopin
and you. To hear his Chopin is like
hearing Schumann-Heink sing Schu
mann or Harold Bauer play him. It is
the acme of grace, distinction, poise,
authority. It is poetry, and poetry ut
terly, intensely Polish at that. There
is nothing more suggestive here than
De Pachmann's individualizing of the
waltz and mazurka. Both have a fabu
lous "measure of the dance spirit and
both are charactewsticized in an amaz
ing fashion. He played the Grande
Mazurka in B minor and the A flat
waltz, op. 42âmay you hear them. I
hope if you do that the pianist will
shout over to you as he did to us in the
waltz, "Different rhythms, listen!" You
might not otherwise notice.
His other numbers were the Bal
lade in A fiat majorâan imperially
beautiful rendering; the D flat major
nocturne (Op. 27, No. 2); and four
studies, Op. 25, 3, 4, 9. The "Butterfly"
was, of course, repeated, and the
house howled and shrieked for more.
Here Mr. de Pachmann did not play
fair. He got up, laughing out loud at
the noise, then sat down as if to play
it againâbut went on to the next num
ber.
The audience, fairly large, was roy
ally friendly and wonderfully noisy.
They laughed, listened and shouted
with the pianist and quite agreed with
him that they could not get anything
better than what he gave them of
Chopin. You cannot. It Is not to be
had. In it, by the way, I am forget
ting to mention the Schumann sonata
In G minor that completed the pro
gramme.
There will be another concert to-mor
row evening and another delightful
programme.

Run Down by a Streetcar.
Helen Gunniston was run down by a
Sixth-street car at the corner of How
ard street last night and severely in
jured. She was treated at the hospital
by Dr. Kucich for a lacerated scalp
and a fractured skull.
roles, from the musical point of view,
have differed with that of Zasa so
radically that they have not afforded a
fit criterion to Judge Berlindi in her
claim to being a dramatic soprano with 1
anything like the thoroughness that I
Zaza supplies.
The audience was large, but did not
fill the opera-house by any means.
There were scores of vacant seats in
the dress circle and higher up, and also
gaps in the orchestra. Fashion was
comparatively little in evidence, but
distributed through the house were
those who would be easily accepted
upon the enumeration of their names
as representative, largely, of .the real
musical culture of San Francisco. Con
sequently the approval that met Ber
lindi did not smack of the perfunctory
and there was little of claque in evi
dence. The demonstration therefore
gave full reason and justification for
Berlindi orlde and satisfaction.
Signor Colli had a curtain call or two
and was compelled to sing one of his
solos a second time. Colli has force j
when he exerts it, and this goes well I
with certain dramatic situations in
"Zaza." He is not the possessor of the
sweetness of the lyric tenor, and others
have surpassed him in several respects,
who have appeared on the stage of the
Tivoli. Last night he created a decid
edly favorable impression. As a lover;
he was languishing. La Puma as Cas
car added to his laurels very materially.
He was In accord with the spirit that
moved Berlindi. His voice has not been i
heard to better advantage during the I
season. Signorina Bettini, Miss Eu
genia Barker, Helen Peters, Rossi, Cor- |
tesi, Cervi, Napoleoni, Pelligrinl and!
Perron were in the cast, also Signorina
I Tofanelli as Toto.

night at Scottish Hall by the St. An
drew's Society with appropriate ad

friends and the elaborate programme
wa* frequently applauded. The open
ing: selection by Fairgrieves' Orchestra,
entitled "A Nicht WT Burns." con
sisted of a medley of Scottish airs, into
which many of the poet's songs were
woven.
An introductory address was de
livered by President J. C. Fyfe, tell
ir.Â», of the life of Burns. He was fol
lowed by A. C. Reed, who sang "There
Was a Lad Was Born in Kyle." Dr.
J. Wilson Shiels cleverly recited "Ad
dress to a Haggis" and "To a Mouse."
One of the hits of the evening was
the song. "Afton Water." sung by Miss
Helen Colburn Heath with simple and
dainty effect. Dr. William Rader
then delivered the address of the even
ing on "The Genius of Robert Burns."
Following the address came songs and
recitations by Miss Viola Van Orden,
Miss Hattie M. Corlett. A. C. Read,
Alexander Smith and Miss Helen Col
burn Heath. At the conclusion of the
programme the beautiful "Auld Lang
Syne" was sung. The evening ended
with dane ing and the serving of re
freshments.

Misty's Pride Runs in
Ahead oi Some
Fair Ones.
â¢ BY FRED E. MULHOLLAND.
When Louis Ezell arose from his
couch yesterday morning the first
thing he did was to look in his left
stocking to see if anybody had taken
the handicap away from him. The
tall, ministerial-looking owner recalled
a dream that Christmas was here
again and that W. R. Condon had made
a cat-hop of the $1000 mile and a fur
long handicap yesterday at Oakland.
W. R. Condon with his 110 pounds
â¢ made good by skimming through the
adobe gravy, which was deep and juicy
on the track, without drawing a long
breath. Backed from 8 to 5 to 11 to
10, the bay horse touched only the high
.spots, Sais, which finished second,
. at no time being able to extend him.
Modicum lost the show to Captain
Forsee.
The card, an extremely fetching one,
attracted a good attendance, and some
first-class sport was witnessed. While
only two public choices won, none of
the purse setters escaped the talent.
HOOLIGAN BEATS SALABLE.
Del Fountain's good three-year-old
Hooligan beat Salable the length of
an oyster can for the last purse, there
by causing tremendous rejoicing in
" certain circles. Hooligan was a good
thing from Springviile. and, opening
at 10, his odds fell to 7. Many things
contributed to the outsider's victory.
Sea Air, the favorite, tried to run out
most of the way, and Knapp beat the
filly shamefully on the head. Me-
Bride did everything, from a pirouette
to a head stand on the back of Salable,
the second choice. Then Lloyd Foun
tain appeared in his slide for life with
Hooligan, and, dropping from ten feet
nbove the center pole, nailed Salable
a nose on the wire. It was an aston
ishing feat for a hitherto low-salaried
artist.
Educate proved a good repeater by
coming back after her win of the pre
ceding day and downing a racy field In
the introductory sprint. The mare had
Davit* in the saddle and, quoted at 3%
to 1, won all the way. Sir Preston,
which opened favorite- and receded to
fours, finished second, three lengths
iihead of Hipponax. Profitable*, the
post choice, ran fourth.
PICKAWAY IS MADE FAVORITE.
After a prolonged vacation Pjckaway
came out of retirement, to be installed
favorite for the Futurity course num
ber, which followed. Possibly if Fort
. Wayne had not been a starter in the
race the favorite might have scored.
The outsider had a well defined dash of
early speed, and It did Pickaway no
good trying to outrun him. As Davis
turned wide into the stretch with his
mount Tommy Clark made a short cut
with Sol Liechtenstein and in a driving
finish earned the decision by half a
length. Dora I finished third.
There was nothing to the five-furlong
purse fixture but Misty's Pride. The
books laid as good as even money
about the Oregon mare and she breezed
'home first. "Big Bill" Knapp. on Al
bert Fir, easily disposed of Tramotor
for place honors. Davis went the over
land route with Bell Reed.
Somewhat erratic Major Tenny made
his first appearance with the Multno
mah stable colors up in the mile and
fifty yard run and came out of it with
a pair of winning brackets. A hot tip
sent Cincinnatus to the post favorite
at 8 to B, the newcomer being touted
as a certainty. Anvil and Bard Burns
were also well supported. Charley Bell,
astride Major Tenny, shook off Bard
Burns on the back stretch turn and
nothing else got close enough to make
him gallop. The favorite, hard ridden
by Davis, beat Anvil several lengths
for the place.

Disorder
la the fall of 18951-contracted that fear
ful disease, Blood Poison. It gained such
headway that I was forced to resign my
position and seek relief at Hot Springs.
After spending all the means I had I went
to Memphis. In less than three weeks I
was in a hospital, and after nine weeks of
suffering I was discharged as cured. In
less than a month every bone in my body
seemed to be affected and felt as if they
would break at the least exertion. Again
I was compelled to resign, and I returned
to the hospital for a seven weeks stay.
When I came out I was advised to try
farming. When I first went on the farm I
Prevailed on the only firm who handled
rugs to get me one dozen bottles of S. S.
S. At that time both of my hands were
broken out with blisters and I was covered
with boils and sores. In the meantime my
druggist had gotten two dozen bottles of
S. S. S. for me and I began its use, and
after taking the thirteenth bottle not a
sore or boil was visible. R. B. Powell.

tonia (providing the court decides in
Colonel Applegate's favor). The head
quarters of the club will be in Chicago.
Another meeting of the new turf body
will be held at Hot Springs on Febru
ary 4, at which meeting directors of
each jockey club will be present and
by-laws be drafted. At this conference
the allotment of dates will also be

indefinite period.
Those present at the meeting were
Ed Corrigan, Humphrey Devereaux,
Rome Respess, William T. Shannon, J.
L. Rhinock, Matt Winn, P. J. Carmody
and Samuel Wagner. It was decided
that any horseman who has not been
ruled off the turf for fraud is eligible to
membership in the new organization.
Ed Corrigan was made temporary
chairman and Humphrey Devereaux
was made temporary secretary of the
American Jockey Club.
HURDLER LANAGAN RETURNS
TO STANFORD UNIVERSITY
Cardinal Adherents Are Delighted, as
He Will Strengthen the Track
Team Materially.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan. 25.
W. H. Lanagan, Stanford's crack
hurdler, returned to college this morn
ing and registered in the geology and
mining department. Lanagan's return
means ten possible points for Stan
ford's score in the intercollegiate field
meet with California next April. Lan
agan left before . Christmas to follow
active practice wdrk near Folsom and
his unexpected return brings Joy to
the hearts of the cardinal supporters.
Pony Races Are Postponed.
Owing to the heavy rains of the past
few days it has been deemed advis
able by the officials of the California
Polo and Pony Racing Association to
postpone the matinee races scheduled
for Saturday on the private track of
Charles W. Clark at San Mateo. The
meeting will be held one week later,
February 4, weather permitting.
The meeting is intended as a friend
ly gathering, and as the track has
been unfit for training and would be
unsafe for racing, it was thought best
to postpone it one week.

Former Mayor and Tax Col

Faces Criminal Accusation
SANTA BARBARA, Jan. 25.âEd
mund M. Burke, former Mayor of
Santa Barbara, and for four years Tax
Collector of this county, was placed
under arrest this afternoon charged
with embezzlement, and to-night Is
awaiting the results of the efforts of
his attorney to secure $5000 bonds fixed
by Justice Peace, pending a preliminary
examination.
For the past ten days and nights a
corps of experts has been examining
the accounts of Burke, who resigned
last December. When the change was
made an inspection of the accounts dis
closed a shortage of $1800, this shortage
having been verified by the experts
appointed by the District Attorney.
Burkes bondsmen made good, and to
cover them valuable property was as
signed by Burke to them. It was sup
posed when the first shortage was dis
covered and met by the bondsmen and
with the subsequent resignation of
Burke the difficulties of the Tax Collec
tor had ended and the second alleged
deficit came as a matter of - surprise.
DESIRE TO SEE BULL FIGHT
ENDS BADLY FOR YOUNG MAN
John Thompson, While Being Chased
by a Policeman. Falls and Frac
tures His Skull.
John Thompson, 21 years old, was
fatally injured last night while at
tempting to gain entrance in the rear
of Woodward's Pavilion to view the
bull fight. While being chased by Po
liceman M. Murphy of the City Hall
station Thompson tripped over a curb
ing and fell, striking his head on the
asphalt of the street.
The injured man was hurried to the
Receiving Hospital, where Dr. Kucich
discovered a fracture at the base of
the skull.
Several young boys say they heard
that the policeman struck Thompson,
knocking him down against the curb.
A woman is said to have made this
statement also, though no one could
be found who actually saw the acci
dent.
Policeman Murphy says he saw a
gang of boys trying to open the rear
door of the pavilion. He ran toward
them, chasing Thompson. He says
the man tripped over the curb and fell,
striking his head. Murphy denies
that he struck him.
Thompson will probably die. He is
the son of O. Thompson of 1326 Jes
sie street, an inspector employed by
the United Railroads.

HYLAND READY
TO STOP BOXING
Will Put on the Gloves To
â¢Day for the Last Time in
Training With Nelson
FUN AT NEIL'S CAMP
Young Corbett and Trainer
McDonald Make Disap
pointing Trip for Ducks
Dick Hyland will do his last hard
work with the gloves in training to
day at the Ocean Beach, when he will
have a friendly set-to wit,h Battling
Nelson. The latter has a kindly feel
ing for Hyland, who fights in the same
aggressive as the man from
Hegewisch.
Nelson says the boxing enthusisasts
see only Neil in the coming fight and
talk learnedly of his class. The Bat
tler says they saw only the class of
Canole, Corbett and other victims of
his prowess and that Hyland may rout
the followers of class in the coming
fight.
Hyland boxed four fast rounds with
big Dave Barry yesterday and three
rounds with McCloud.
The day was a quiet one at Frankie
Neil's training quarters at Billy Shan
non's villa near San Rafael. On Tues
day night Young Corbett, his brother,
Jimmle Rothwell, Frank McDonald and
Bill Richardson went duck shooting at
the San Rafael Duck Club preserve,
about seventeen miles from camp. Con
sequently Frankie was left alone. He
retired early, but was up at daylight
yesterday and took a ten-mile Jog.
About 11 o'clock a rusty looking indi
vidual, driving a horse that had seen
better days, approached the camp and
yelled for something to eat. Billy
Shannon was about to call a constable,
but after the supposed tramp managed
to scrape some of the mud from his
face he was recognized as Young Cor
bett, and alone, footsore, and worst of
all, hungry.
Frankie Neil nearly died laughing
and started to kid Corbett about the
ducks.
"Ducks!" exclaimed Corbett. "I'm
ashamed to look a duck in the face."
He then told his troubles to Frankie,
who winked at Shannon. When near
the duck preserve one of the horses
went lame, so the occupants had to
wade, through mire for nearly two
miles.
Jimmle Rothwell, in attempting to
gain the club veranda, slipped and
fell overboard. Curtains for him for
the rest of the night.
The ducks got wise that something
was doing and didn't appear. The
night was long and cold, as there was
a scarcity of fuel.
At last dawn approached and the
weary hunters started for home. One
of the horses was unable to travel, so
Corbett mounted the other one and
rode to the nearest livery stable at
Novato and hired a cart and drove to
San Rafael,. A rescue party was im
mediately dispatched to the scene and
late in the afternoon the three would
be hunters reached camp.
Neil took the afternoon off and came
over to the Orpheum. He returned
home in time for dinner. *
Although the seats will not be placed
on sale until to-morrow, Manager
Greggalns has advance orders for
$1000 worth of the pasteboards. This
is taken as an indication that a large
crowd will witness the fight.
BOXING BOUTS ARE PROMISING.
Hawthorne Club Matchmaker Brings
Together Good Material.
Gloves will fly to-morrow night in
Woodward's Pavilion. Some of the
best boxers of the city will battle be
fore the Hawthorne Club and specta
tors are promised some fast fighting.
Seldom has an exhibition excited so
much talk. It is the first show given
by the club and every man who is on
the programme is a veteran of the
game and has won his laurels in the
arena.
There will be a lot of money wager
ed on the contest between Lew Powell
and Bob Calms. Powell held the light
weight championship until he allowed
Young Choynski to come in over
wtight and gain a decision over him.
Lew now hopes to retrieve his lost
laurels by handily beating Cairns and
then forcing Choynski to come down
to his weight. Cairns is one of the
best boxers developed at the Olympic
Club. He is a terrific puncher. He
has met and defeated Mike Synfy, Wil
lie Wolf, Young Dempsey and a dozen
others and has a feeling that he can
trim clever Lew Powell.
Willie Wolf has been beaten but
once since starting his fighting career.
He is a fast lad with his mitts and
can take a drubbing. In Charley
Dunne he will meet a dangerous oppo
nent. Dunne is developing in the
game and before long may turn pro
fessional. "Rough House" Billy Mc-
Donald and Frank Mayfield should put
up a rip-roaring bout. These two
would rather fight than eat and are
evenly matched in size, strength and
ability to mix things.
Eddie Kehoe and Harry Baker are
also evenly matched. Harry Tenny is
the most dangerous amateur of his
weight in the game td-day. In Frankie
Edwards, however, he will meet a foe
man worthy of his steel. Edwards
proved his ability when he beat
Tommy West, the boy who was on the
way to championship laurels.
Pete Sullivan and Jim Keegan are
to open the show. Sullivan is a new
man in the game, but the easy way
he disposed of Artie Granfield proved
his success as a fighter.
Eddie Smith of Oakland will referee
the bouts. George Harting will hold
the watch.
SOLDIER SAYS HE WAS
DRUGGED AND ROBBED
Complains He Was Directed by
Chance Acquaintance to Lodging-
House Where Theft Took Place.
William Spores, a soldier, who had
just returned from the Philippines,
was discharged from the service last
Monday. Spores got $103 from the
paymaster and later met a civilian,
whom he asked to recommend him to
a decent lodging-house. The stranger
took him to a lodging-house, where
he went to bed. Yesterday morning
the proprietor Invited him to partake
of some hot coffee. After he drank
the coffee he was seized with cramps,
which rendered him unconscious.
When he came to he found that his
purse, containing his money, had been
taken from under his pillow. He went
to the Emergency Hospital and placed
himself under the care of Dr. Carl G.
Wilson for treatment for poisoning.
He can give no description of bis new
acquaintance.
NO GORE SHED
AT BOLL FIGHT
Senor Robles and His Pica
dores Fail to Excite
Bloodthirsty Spectators
BEASTS SLIP AND FALL
Jack Johnson's Desire for
Speechmaking Ceases as
Warning Signal Is Given
There were no ambulances waiting
outside Woodward's Pavilion last
night to carry off the mangled pica
dores and toreadores or the women
who were supposed to faint. The
bulls came near hurting themselves
badly by sliding over the slippery
floors, but luckily they had too much
sense to try the trick often, so blood
shed on both sides was averted.
The bull fight game may go for the
impulsive Spanish multitude, but It's
not spirited enough for the people of
San Francisco, who have been in the
habit of seeing men fight Had it not
been for Jack Johnson and his little
clown side play those present would
be forced to admit that they were
bunkoed. Johnson's daring climb into
the gallery was the bread winner and
life saver of the night.
The flodr of the pavilion was about
half covered with tanbark and every
time the bulls tried to make a charge
they slipped and, fell. It was impos
sible for the beasts to go more than
a few feet at a time."TPfl the meantime
Senor Robles and his able corps of
picadores were frantically waiving red
rags and brown rags and rags of every
size and hue at the bull, which winked
at the crowd and proceeded to stall.
FLOOR IS SLIPPERY.
What might have happened with a
good floor is unsettled, but the bull
would undoubtedly have secured the
decision over .the senor and his pic
adores. None of them did anything
that alarmed the crowd, save one man.
in a barrel, who was game enough to
let the bull play football with him
for several minutes.
After Senor Robles had piped a lit
tle song the first bull was turned loose.
There was a snort and a kick and
then the beast tried to charge. There
was too much slippery floor in evi
dence and the best he did was to slip
down and get up again. This was
gone over a few times and then the
senor caught the bull by the tail and
horns and showed those present what
he could do if it came to a pinch.
The first bull was voted a failure
by the multitude, but after the second
one had been in evidence a few min
utes they began to yell for number
one again. The second wild beast was
not there. He had no fighting blood
in his veins and was looking for a
getaway hole all the time. After the
picadores and the senor had officed
up to him for a few minutes bull num
ber one was brought forth again, but
he was all in after his first trial and
the show soon broke up.
JOHNSON MAKES A HIT.
During one of the intermissions
Jack Johnson, the champion colored
heavyweight boxer, expressed a -desire
to get into the middle of the ring and
rid himself of some overflow elo
quence. Some one invited Jack to
climb over from the balcony and he
proceeded to follow out Instructions.
When his task was half completed a
voice from the gallery yelled. "Look
out for the bull." Jack tried to get
up again, but no one volunteered to
aid him and he hung for a minute in
midair, with his feet dangling and the
band playing "Good-By, Little Girl,
Good-By."
Finally Jack climbed up in the gal
lery and came down the stairs. He
was introduced and insisted on mak
ing a speech. Just as he had finished
saying "Ladies and gentlemen" Senor
Robles rushed up from behind, hold
ing a red cloth and yelling like a real
bull. Jack took the fence in a leap
and cut the speech out.
As a preliminary to the bull fight
George Braun and Jack Ely wrestled,
the former winning two falls out of
three.
Prisoners Plead Guilty.
Herman Meyers pleaded guilty In
Judge Dunne's court yesterday to a
charge of burglary and will be sen
tenced on February 1. He entered
the room of Louis Pittroff, 118U Ellis
street, on November 2 and stole 30
cents. Charles Svensen pleaded guil
ty in Judge Cook's court to a charge
of grand larceny and will be sentenced
on January 30. He stole $5 from
Hippolyte Allain on December 2.

SHOOTS DOWN
MAN ON TRAIN
Insurance Cashier Fatally
Wounds Bival for Wife' 4 *
Love on Chicago Elevated
CHICAGO. Jan. 25.âPassengers on
an eastbound Metropolitan elevated
train were thrown into a panic last
night when George H. Gould, cashier
of an insurance company, shot and
fatally wounded A. K. Hammond, a
guard employed by the road.
Hammond was off duty and was re
turning home. Gould boarded the train
and entered the car where the guard
was sitting. Witnesses to the shooting
say he at once accused Hammond of
alienating the affections of his wife,
who, Gould said, left home, deserting
her husband and three little children,
a week ago. Words followed, and be
fore the train had reached the next
station Gould drew a revolver and fired
two shots.
There were more than twenty pas
sengers in the car, and these persons
fled to the other coaches of the train.
The train crew telephoned to the police,
asking for an ambulance to meet the
train at the Marshfield-avenue sta
tion. They then hurried the wounded
man to that station without making
stops. Gould stayed in the car and sur
rendered himself to the police.
Among the persons in the station at
Marshfleld avenue was Mrs. Gould,
who said she was waiting for a friend,
whose name she refused to divulge!
When she saw Hammond being carried
out of the station she started forward
with a cry. Both she and her husband
were locked up. Hammond was taken
to a hospital, where it was said that
he could not recover. One of the bul
lets took effect in his left side an inch
below the heart and the other pene
trated his left wrist.
Before her marriage Mrs. Gould was
Mary L. Everts. Her relatives live in
Rhode Island.BLOCKADE RUNNER GOES ASHORE
M. 5. DOLLAR OM VLADIVOSTOK BEACH
There is every reason to believe that
the steamship M. 8. Dollar, which left
here December 31 ostensibly for Mojl,
but in reality for Vladivostok, with a
large, cargo of contraband for. the Rus
sian Government, is piled up on the
rocks at the Russian port. M. A. Newell
. & Co., the local firm through which all
reinsurance speculation is done, yes
terday received a cable from London
quoting a rate of SO per cent for rein
surance on the M. S. Dollar and stating
as the reason for the underwriters' de
sire to protect themselves that a vessel
corresponding in description to jthe
Dollar was ashore at Vladivostok. The
cablegram furnished no details as to
the seriousness of the vessel's predica
ment.
At the offices of the Dollar Steamship
Company In this city the description
furnished in the London cable is taken
as. sufficient to identify the vessel in
trouble with the M. S. Dollar? but as no
Uves. appear to have been lost the inci
dent is not causing any special worry,
as the steamship was fully insured.
The amount of insurance was not given
out for publication.
The vessel was chartered by Harry J.
. Hart and the cargo, which consisted of
hay, oats, barley and a little lumber,
is said to have been insured in London.
â¢ The M. S. Dollar, although owned
â¦here, flies the British flag. She was
formerly the Arab and is well known at
..this port. She left here December 31.
. She cleared for Mojl, but it was gen
erally understood, that she was under
; orders to run the blockade and take her
cargo into Vladivostok. She has reached
. Vladivostok. Whether her cargo will
be worth delivering or whether the
steamship will be floated will probably
.not be known for a few days. Captain
Cross, w ; ho is In command of the M. S.
Dollar, was formerly chief officer of
that'vessel. He was promoted to the
command when Captain Gow, the
â¢former skipper, left for Scotland to
bring out a new steamship built on the
Clydeâ¢for the Dollar Steamship Com
pany.
The M. S. Dollar was built in IS9O at
Newcastle, England. She Is a vessel of
2674 net tons register. Her cargo was
aos follows: 14,003 centals of barley,
.valued at $16,103; 27,000 bales of hay,
valued at $21,600 ; 30.000 centals of oats,
valued at $45,000, and 10.000 feet of lum
ber, used as dunnage, valued at $115.
Fog Impedes Navigation.
The steamer Whittler lost herself In the fog
' yesterday morning and narrowly escaped going
,aih.ore on Mission flats. Fortunately she was
going at slow speed and when the rapid shoal
ing of the water was detected, she was able to
stop and back away from the threatened dan
ger. A heavy fog hung over the harbor all
day and made navigation difficult. On all the
ferry routes the boats ran on fog schedule and
'no accidents were reported, nor were any of the
boats unduly delayed. Running ferry .boats,
as most of them are with passengers,
lft. thick weather, is anxious work and in view
of- the sccentricity of local tides a day like yes->
terday without accident Is a high tribute to
the skill and good Judgment of the men re
â spaneible for piloting the big boats back and
forth. At hardly any time during the day
cculd the pilots see mors than two boat lengths*
in any direction.
Will Be an Oil Barge.
' The old bark Sonoma, famous for some ex
ceedingly long passages. Is to have her wings
permanently clipped and never again, unless
perhaps trailing behind a towboat, will she
be seen outside the Golden Gate. She has
been purchased by the Transport Oil Company
â¢and will be converted into a floating oil depot
to fee stationed permanently at an anchorage
in the harbor. e*Blg tanks will be built in her
holds and she will be furnished with pumping
gear for the loading and discharging of liquid
fuel. The oil with which her tanks will be
.s.tored Is to brought here from Port Harford.

Â°6000 tons of Government supplies, sailed yes
terday for the Philippines. She left the trans
â  port wharf promptly at noon, but It was late
. afternoon before the fog had lifted sufficiently
'. to' allow the big troopship to proceed safely to

S. D. Carleton Is Floated.
. The ship 8. D. Carleton, which was blown
. ashore some time ago at Bellingham, was float

the Carloton would prove a total loss as she
* was driven ashore during a heavy gale and at
high Ode.
Water Front Notes.
. The big British steamer Tottenham will sail
'fn a. few days for the Orient, with Vladivo
utock as her probable destination. W, B.
; Swears has been asked to secure several of
ficers for her as she lacks her full comple

The little tug L. Roscoe. which came here
from the Rogue River to be overhauled, sailed
.yesterday for her home port.
Carl Anderson, a pallor on the steamer New

WITTMAN WANTS JACKSON
STREET ORDER DISSOLVED
Says Injunction Protects Inmates of
Immoral Resort From Arrest
by Police.
To-morrow morning- in Judge Heb
bard's court a motion will be made by
Chief of Police Wittman for a dissolu
tion of the injunction prohibiting the
Police Department from raiding the
immoral resort at 621 Jackson street.
The injunction was obtained by Sebas
tian Ravanl, owner of the cigar store
by which an entrance to the premises
Is effected. The Chief contends that
Ravani's suit was not in good faith,
but brought for the purpose of pro
tecting the inmates of the house from
arrest. Accompanying the notice of
motion are affidavits of Bert I. Wren
and William W. Lambert describing
the premises, discussing the character
and practices of the inmates and de
claring it necessary for the prevention
of crime that the police have constant
supervision over the .place.
The bum actor is sometimes egged on
to his worst.

SLAVES FINISH
THEIR STORIES
These Tally in Every Case
and Implicate Lee Toy
the Philadelphia Merchant
Lung Ah Duck finished her testimony
yesterday In the United States District
Court. She repeated her statement
that Da Silva struck her on the mouth
with the back of his'hand because she
refused to accept his coaching. The
witness admitted that ,he Doric was
several days out from Hongkong before
she met Da Silva. She said also that
she was put into the lockup by Da
Silva, but denied that she was drunk
and quarrelsome on that occasion.
Le Oun Kew, a nineteen-year-old
slave girl, gave like testimony. She
said that Da Silva struck her on the
mouth because she had refused to con
sent to the proposal made by Lee Toy
that she should lead an Immoral life in
this country after the close of the St.
Louis Exposition. The witness testi
fied also that Lee Toy came to her
while she was being examined in the
Chinese Bureau and threatened that
the bureau officials might hang her if
she told any story other than the
coached one.
Yuen Tsoy Fung, 17 years old, the
prettiest of the four, told a similar
story. She testified also to the fact
that Lee Toy was allowed to enter the
Chinese Bureau and converse with the
twelve women whom he had taken
over on the Doric, The testimony of
Chun Ho, the last of the four, was sim
ilar, except that Lee Toy told her that
he had paid $660 for her in Hongkong.
The case will be resumed this morn
ing.
It's easier for a woman to love a
man than it Is for her to agree with
another woman.
RESENTS ACTION
OF SUPERVISORS
Works Board Makes Caustic
Reply to Criticism About
Post Street Curve Permit
MAESTRETTI IS ANGRY
Questions Delay in Prepa
ration of Specifications
for Paving Thoroughfare
The Board of Public Works yesterday
| replied to the charge made last Mon
| day in a resolution adopted by the Su-
I pervisors that the first named board
j had acted without authority and in an
! unwarranted manner in issuing a per
! Mit to the United Railroads to open
! streets and to. lay a curved track at
' Post and Kearny streets upon the
; ground that there is apparently no ex
press grant made in the franchise of
said company or its predecessors in in
terest to lay such a curved track- The
board is also directed not to issue any
more such permits. . M
The Board of Publlo Works adopted
a counter resolution as follows:
Resolved. That this board deems that the
Board of Supervisors, in respect to the earn
i notification and direction in said resolution
i contained, has transcended the limitation of
! the power (ranted to it by the charter: and
that Its action in passing such a resolution
I was an attempted assumption of the power ex
: pressly granted to the Mayor of this city and
I county, in and by virtue of the provisions of
I chapter 1 of article 4 of the charter, and
which jTovisions contemplate that the legisla
tive department of the municipality shall con
cern itself with matters only that are legisla
tive in character That this board is entitled
to the presumptions of law; "that official duty
â as been regularly performed," and "that the
| law has been oTeyed"; that In numerous ln
' stances this boaid has refused to Issue permits
to enable perse ns or corporations to enjoy
prlvileres granted by the Board of Supervisors
! which were not authorised by law. as in the
I cases of the grants of the privilege to obstruct
the public streets, and divert the public use
' thereof to private use for private purposes, by
: the laying thetfon of spur tracks, and which
want of authority was very evident from the
fact that the Board of Supervisors submitted
an amendment to the charter last year, provid
ing for a grant of power to grant spur track
privileges for private use.
; Commissioner Eagan said he did not
! consider the Board of Supervisors the
1 properly constituted body to reflect on
the acts of any municipal department,
i That all is not harmonious between
the Board of Public Works and the
City Engineer's office was demonstrated
when President Maestretti objected to
the delay in the preparation of specifi
cations for the improvement of H
street.
"I will direct the secretary to ask tfie
City Engineer to file his report on the
matter of paving H street on or before
next Wednesday's meeting," said Maes
tretti. "There seems to be some object
in delaying this work, and I want to
know about it."
Assistant Engineer Morser, who was
sent for, explained that it would take
j some time to prepare the specifications.
| "There has been some work done and
I that must be measured."
j "What have you done in regard to
measuring the area already done?"
asked Maestretti.
"We have done-nothing." said Morser,
"as we have not had the time."
"Well, if you are overworked in your
office." said Maestretti, "we will have
the data looked up here and send it
over to you."
Morser assured the board that the
work of preparing the specifications
would be vigorously prosecuted and a
report filed in a few days.
The City Attorney was asked for an
opinion as to whether Clay street runs
through Lafayette square.
Bids were ordered to be Invited for
the paving of Fourth street, between
Market and Howard, for the construc
tion of a safety station at Market and
Powell streets and for a driveway for
the election booth warehouse.
The petition of the Central Improve
ment Club that sidewalks be construct
ed on Market street, from Fourteenth
to Seventeenth, was taken under ad
visement.
The bids for work on Ninteenth ave
nue, from I to J streets, were rejected
, owing to an error in the proceedings.
Hart Cited for Contempt.
I Upon application of the Nevada Mill
ing and Mining Company, Judge
Troutt yesterday cited General W. H.
EL Hart to show cause next Tuesday
; why he should not be punished for
1 contempt for refusing to testify as tp
I his property before Referee L. Seiden
berg. Over two years ago the mining
company got a judgment for more
than $5000 against Hart on a promis
sory note, but has not been able to
collect. His examination was ordered,
but he'refused to testify as to his prop
erty on the grounds that he lives in
Santa Clara County, that the mining
company Is a foreign corporation that
i has not compiled with the California
laws and that the order of examina
tion has already had a hearing before
Judge Troutt. _ _
Adopted Son Contests Will.
Frank D. Mosher, adopted son of
Annie Mosher, who died of paralysis
January 8 at the King's Daughters'
Home, yesterday filed a contest of her
will of April 80 last, which left half of
her $1000 estate $o William House, a
barber. Mosher claims that Mrs.
Mosher had been declared incompetent
before the will was made and had not
been restored to capacity. He claims
all of the estate under a will of No
vember 15, 1899.

CITY FATHERS
FAVOR ASPHALT
They Eecommend Use of
Home Product in Paving
of Mission and H Streets
IBON POLES EXPENSIVE
a
United Eailroads Says the
Short Period of Franchise
Does Not Warrant Cost
The Supervisors' Street Committee
yesterday put itself on record as being
in favor of the use of asphalt in mate
rials to be used for the paving of
streets. The committee reported in fa
vor of rejecting the recommendation of
the Works Board that the ordinance or
dering the paving with asphalt of Mis
sion street, from Onondaga avenue to
the county line, be rescinded. The
board wants to bitumlnize the street
because the intersecting streets are so
paved. City Engineer Woodward stated
that he had recommended an asphalt
pavement. The committee expresi d
itself in favor of asphalt, it being a
California product, and also directed
that it be used on H street, from Sev
enth to Twentieth avenues.
The committee requested the Brard
of Works to file a for the
purchase of six sweeping machines at
a cost of about $2000. Inspector c:ow- ,
den reported that the deficit in the
â treat sweeping fund was $18,000, and a j
great saving could be effected by using
the machines.
The Street Committee heard repre
sentatives of the United Railroads rela
tive to the proposed type of construc
tion on the California street extension
steam road, which is to be converted
into an electric system. The corpora
tion intends to put up wooden poles,
and some of the Supervisors think iron,
poles should be erected.
Tirey L. Ford, attorney for the cor- j
poration, argued that the only matter \
before the committee was the grant of
a permit to use electricity on California I
street, from Parker street to First aye- '
nue, a distance of three blocks, as the
company already has the privilege for
the rest of the road. Ford said that the '
franchise for the greater part of the
road expired in six years, and this fact
did not warrant the great expense for
the purchase of iron poles, which cost
830 each. The committee decided to in
spect the route of the line next Satur
day at 10 o'clock.
"In the meantime." said Braunhart.
facetiously, "I suppose you are laying
the curve at Post and Kearny streets."
"The curve is already laid," said
Ford with dignity, "and the cars are
running."
John Quinn addressed the committee
on behalf of the Merchants' Associa
tion against the noise caused by the
switch engines of the railroad compa
nies. It was decided to communicate
with Eastern cities regarding regula
tions on the matter.
The long-pending dispute over the
proposed improvement of blocks on
Parnassus avenue and Lotta street was
settled by a recommendation that both
blocks be paved.
TWENTY-FIRST INFANTRY
HOLDS FINAL DRILL
Regiment Preparing to Leave for the
Philippines on the First of
February.
The Twenty-first Infantry yesterday
held its last drill on the parade
ground in front of the General Hos
pital. Colonel C. A. Williams, com
manding, ordered that all drills be
suspended after Wednesday. The of
ficers' schools have finished their re
views and the examinations by the
field officers and senior captains are
now going on and will be continued '
on the transport Sherman, which !
leaves February 1 for the Philippines. j
Lieutenant William M. Goodale, -
signal corps, left for Hot Springs,
Ark., for a short stay. Mrs. Goodaie
remains in the city. Lieutenant G. B.
G. Hanna returns this morning from
detached work at Point Bonita. No
arrivals were. registered yesterday at
department headquarters.
Captain B. C. Morse of the Seven- I
teenth Infantry, who lately arrived â 
from the Philippines, is assigned to
special duty in the place of Captain
John J Bradley, who left Tuesdny for
Vancouver Barracks.
Deputy Registrars Want Pay.
Henry M. Shaw, one of the deputy
registrars appointed prior to the last
erection, for himself and twenty-eight
others yesterday sued for a writ of
mandate to compel Auditor Baehr to
audit their salary warrants. The
warrants were duly approved by the
Election Commissioners, but the pay
has been withheld on the ground that
the men were not appointed from the
civil service lists. Shaw's suit gives a
list of deputies employed as follows:
Seven in March, fifteen in April, forty
three in July, thirteen In August and
thirty-nine in September.
Steffens' Trial Postponed.
The trial of Adolph Steffens for
fraudulently voting at the last pri
mary election, which was set for yes
terday, was by consent continued by
Judge Lawlor till January 30. It is
expected that by that time Detective
Taylor, who arrested Steffens, will
have returned to the city.

He has met every expectation, every ad
vertised promise. He is acknowledged by ail
who consult him as a true exponent of the
occult science tor overcoming trouble, bad
luck, ill health, business, love, family and
financial worries. Would it not be a relief
to know how you will succeed, to be relieved
of the matters that are troubling you and
of the schemes ot your enemies that you
may meet with better success? His only
reason for giving your name in full or any
important information you may desire Is
that ho does this incidentally, as a chain to
rend by, and it is left to your judgment
whether he intelligently does all he claims
and advcitis-s to do.

109 MONTGOMERY ST.
City Lots Accurately and Officially Surveyed.
CHARGES REASONABLE.
My field books, diagrams show, by actual
measurements, the exact points from which
your lot was surveyed, which Is Imperatively
necessary, as the City Surveyor and othtr sur
veyors do not show that and also because all
the original monuments were taken out when
the streets were forme*! In the early days of
the city, since which time the different City
Surveyors extending to the present time have
made innumerable errors in their street and
lot surveys, and to conceal such errors they
have moved the monument lines away from
their original correct positions without legal
authority from the people, causing blocks and
streets to measure Incorrectly, creating excess
measurements In blocks of the most valuable
portion of the city, which they do not distribute
proportionately throughout the block, but often
give the entire excess of sometimes 12 Inches
or more to one person, thereby Interfering with
the deed distances of the people and the abso
lute security of boundary lines.
Consult ma before moving your valuable
buildings on such unfair surveys. Work guar
anteed.

INITIAL ENTERTAINMENT
OF THE ADVANCE CLUB
Occupies Rooms in the Jefferson
Square Building and Outlines
a Policy.
The Advance Club made its initial |
appearance last night in club life of j
San Francisco at its rooms over the j
Jefferson Square building, 925 Golden
Gate avenue. Its objects are not only j
to drive dull care away, but also to
bring about the intellectual and phyt
tea] advancement of its members.
These 'Objects were, to some extent, j
realized last night in a musical and j
literary entertainment, followed by a
dance.
The Advance Club is a Jewish or- j
ganization and consists of profession- j
al and business men. H. L. Samson,
the well known merchant, is its pres
ident. The future of the club seems 1
very bright, as it is organized on lib
eral lines and has set for itself a high
standard. Among its members are ;
men of wide learnintr and travel, in j
whose hands is the installation of a|
library. Chess and whist tourna- '
ments will also be arranged for and* a \
general meeting of the club will take |
place twice a month, at which the
members will be given an opportunuy
to display their dramatic and musi
cal talents.

MAKES ORDER RELEASING
JOSEPH SMITH ON BONDS
Judge Cook Thinks Man Charged !
With MeGowan's Murder Is En
titled to Bail Pending Trial.
Judge Cook yesterday denied the j
application for a writ of habeas cor- j
pus for the release of Joseph Smith,
the old man held to answer by Police
Judge Mogan on a' charge of murder
without bonds, and remanded the ;
prisoner into the custody of the Sher- !
iff. |
Attorney D. J. Murphy asked that
the defendant be admitted to bail. The
Judge said he had carefully read the
testimony taken at the preliminary ex
amoination and he had come to the
conclusion that the defendant was as
much entitled to bail as the defend
ant who was released by the Supreme
Court on bonds last Monday. He
thought that bonds In $25,000 would â¢
be sufficient. Attorney Murphy sug
gested 5 15.000 and finally the Judge
compromised on 520.000.
Smith, during a quarrel with Jo
seph McGowan in a tile yard at 2969
Mission street on the morning of No- |
vember 26. fired a shot at McGowan, !
killing him. MeGowan's father leased
the yard from Smith, who lived in a |
hut on the premises.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Jan. 25.âThe weakness of
' stocks, which became more pronounced to-day,
â¢wis doubtless attributable to the uncertain
outlook in Russia, but the effect waa not pro
duced directly through the usual channels. In
fact, London bought here during the early
' ; a:;t of the day almost as freely as it sold
bn Monday. The tone of the foreign markets
generally also reflected a relaxation of the
y acute anxiety over the situation in Russia, and
â the point of view adopted was indicated by
the circulation of a rumor that advances were
making toward mediation between Russia and
â¢ Japan as a consequence of the embarrassments
of the Russian Government at home. This
foreign influence and the demand to cover
shorts from the late sellers of yesterday gave
the upward Impulse to prices at the opening.
A tendency has been noticeable on the part of
professional traders to put out a line of ehort
contracts late In the day on the supposition
â¢ that unexpected events over night would be
likely to favor the bear side. With the open
ing of the following day's market and with
affairs In Bt. Petersburg apparently better tnan
worse, the market has been strong in the
early dealings. But with the better basis of
prices afforded by tha opening advance to-day
there was aoma Important speculative liqui
â¢ datlon. This was believed to come largely
â from Western sources and from the great
steel centers on the part of operators who
ware responsible for the large transactions of
laet week on the long side of the market. While
â¢ no. positively unfavorable news became known
to' account for the speculative liquidation, it
was thought probable that It had been decided
by those who had entered on the Speculation
:that no considerable public Interest could be
expected in the market while affairs In Russia
continued In so uncertain a state. With pros
â¢ pects poor for an advance In prices, ft seemed
to be considered the part of wisdom to lighten
holdings. The lull In the activity of the In
terior freight movement made an Impression
on senUment, and this was reinforced to-day
by the sharp falling off in gross earnings for
the third week in January as reported by the
Missouri Pacific. The decline in net earn
ings for the Wabash for December was ef
fective in the same direction. The very heavy
dimensions reached by the gold export move
ment to-day was a chilling influence on specu
lative sentiment, the more so as the movement
has no defined limit In sight. It is evident
that Paris regards Its large, holdings of Rus
sian securities as requiring the fortifying of its
gold reserve to an Important extent. The dis
pute among the railroads over export grain
rates aa between the Atlantic and the gulf
ports came In for some consideration, and
favorable action by a Congressional committee
. upon a proposed investigation of the United
States Steel Corporation weighed upou Its
securities. The gold outgo enured a firmer
â¦one for time loans, hut the premium on New
York exchange at Chicago rose sharply. Indi
cating available source for still further re
plenishing the local money supply. The demand
to cover from the day's short sellers was sufil
. -dent to efteet a material rally, and the clos
ing was firm at recoveries from the extreme
declines.
. Bonds were heavy. Total sales, par value,
$5,166,000.
United States bonds were unchanged on call.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. Jan. 25.âThroughout the day the i
situation In Russia was a source of uneasi- |
ness in the wheat pit. At the opening of trad- t
Ing evidence of a lessened movement in grain |
to market In the Northwest helped send the |
price of wheat up %Â®% to %o%c. the Inl- '
Ual quotation being $1 15%0l 16%. The
firmness that pervaded the market had a more
aubstantial basis in buying by commission j
houses. The purchases were generally gauged j
ta apply against sales made by a leading
short interest. In all It Is said that over
million bushels of May wheat were covqjsra 1
for this account. Except for a momentary j
wavering at the start when offerings of long |
lines at the advance caused the May option to
ease off to $1 1501 15%. decidedly more than i
merely adequate support was afforded the .
market by shorts, who haatened to follow the .
example of the larger interests. May ad
vanced to $1 15%01 16%, and closed firm at |
$1 15%.
Corn waa Arm. but trade waa dull. May
started a shade higher at 44% c and cloaed
firm at 45%045'/Â»c.
Oata were steady, though dull. May closed
%@%c up to 30%031c.
A strong market for live hogs gave provi
sions a firm start, with prices up 2%05c. The
close showed a loss on May pork of 2 %'a ."Â»â¢â¢; i
lard and ribs were down 2%c.

1 Excellent Flour sales in this market. Mlnne
! apoiis and Kansas City, and the activity of
millers In primary markets and better Flour
demand by Southeastern dealers, all contrlb
' uted to the' change of sentiment. The action
,of the market in maintaining it* level above
! yesterday's close is significant. It suggests
| the inability of the short sellers to force any
further decline and rather indicates a desire
jon their part at least to reduce their com
mitments. The bearish feeling prevailing In
the trade has been altogether too unanimous
and one-sided and has created a large /hort
interest, which will continue as a prop under
the market."
This market was considerably improved. The
cash grain was- very firm, while futures ad
vanced on the morning session, with an
active business and a bullish feeling among

Flour and Farinaceous Goods.
One ot the American Consul* In England
writes: "The Fli>ur milling industry of Eng
land Is now especially prosperous. On ao
couut of the comparatively low price of Rus
sian and Indian Wheat as compared with that
ot the United States, millers are able to mix
It with Canadian Wheat and thus beat out
American competition In Flour. Liverpool is
row the second largest Flour milling center in
the world. Wheat has been carried the past
season from Montreal to Liverpool at the ex
tremely low rate of 67c a ton. that figure being
lower than the British farmer could get it
railed from his country station to the mill."

Hay and FeedstnfTs.
Higher price* are quoted for Bran. Shorta,
Middlings and Rolled Barley. The Hay mar
ket coatlnues slow and weak.
The circular of Somers at Co. says:
"The Hay .market continues in a rather un
interesting condition, as has been the case
for two or three weeks past. The total ship
ments for the current week amount to 3580
tons, In comparison with 3820 tons for the
week preceding.
"Town trade la rather dull aa well aa the
regular export shipments, but this Is made
up for to some extent by a considerable amount
being shipped to the Orient, presumably for
the Russian Government. Although this de
mand baa taken quite a quantity of Hay off
{he market, yet there la sufficient of all grades
to supply other wants; In fact, we could get
along easily wltn~~l!ghter shipments.
"Rain has fallen quite freely in all parte
of the State of Late and crops have been
greatly benefited. This la especially true of
Southern California, where crop prospects are
said to be better than they were at this time
last year. However, the season has not ad
vanced far enough to absolutely assure us of
abundant crops Wa have known of seasons
when heavy January rains were followed by
cold and dry spells, and so. although thus far
prospect* are good, much will depend on later
conditions.
"In general wa would say the market a)
weak with all grades of Bay earns Miai
lower."

firm at the previously quoted rates.

were in good request, both for local use and

Butter. Cheese and Eggs.
The scarcity in Butter was still acute yes
terday, and though one delayed boat arrived
from Bolinas with supplies, her invoice was so
urgently needed Jhat the market was not af
fected. Those houses who had any Butter to
sell got about what they chose to ask for It,
and buyers who were obliged to have the goods
paid up to 30c in some instances. For several
days most dealers have been saying that just
as soon as the delayed boats get In the mar
ket will fall back, but thus far they have not
got In and the market Is apparently as far
from falling back as it was at the beginning
of the week. The day closed with the floors
practically bare of stock.
The storm has kept back Eggs in the coun
try and the market is steadier in consequence,
with stocks much lighter and prices lc better.
The demand has also Improved and the move
ment Is now reported very satisfactory. Store !
Eggs are even firmer than ranch and are
bringing about as much.

Deciduous and citrus Fruits.
The fruit market was exceedingly dull, as i
the uncertain state of the weather discouraged |
local buyers, and there was no movement to 1
speak of in shipping channels. The attend- !
ance at the arrange auction was small and, â 
although the fruit was of good quality, the
bidding was indifferent and the stock sold at
low price*. Five cars of Navels were die- ;

MAYOR REMOVES HUTTON
FROM THE POLICE BOARD
Police Commissioner H. W. Hutton toppled from his high office yesterday.
Mayor Schmitz exercised the authority of the chief magistracy as set forth
in the city charter. The charges involve the ex-Commissioner with an
eighteen-year-old girl named Viola Keeler, who is an art student. Hutton
stoutly asserts his innocence, but will not contest his dismissal.
Immoral Conduct
Is Given as the
Cause.
Deposed Official
Denies Truth
of Charge.
The career of H. W. Hutton as a
Police Commissioner was brought to an
abrupt close by Mayor Schmitz yester
day afternoon. The chief magistrate
exercised his prerogative and summar
ily ousted the member who has been a
thorn in thetside of the administration
the last two years. Immoral conduct
was given as the cause for removal,
the Mayor having gathered evidence
that links the Commissioner's name
with that of Miss Viola Keeier, an art
student of eighteen years. There are
other allegations of misconduct of the
same character, all of which Mayor
Schmitz declared to be "unbecoming
in a Police Commissioner of the city
and county of rian Francisco."
Hutton is emphatic in denial of the
truth of the charges and declares that
they were trumped up so that he might
be removed and the administration
freed of his persistency in efforts to
enforce the law and make San Fran
cisco a more wholesome city. He says
he has expected such a step by the
Mayor for some time and knew he
was jeopardizing his tenure by being
st> energetic against 1120 Dupont street,
620 Jackson street, the French restau
rants and other places of vice.
KNEW HE WAS SHADOWED.
"I was not deterred in one particular
from doing my duty conscientiously,
fearlessly and with honest purpose,"
said the deposed Commissioner last
night. "While I have been looking for
this to happen, I am surprised, how
ever, at the means adopted. I did not
think they would attack my private
'life. 1 have known that detectives
were shadowing me, but I thought they
were trying to get at me in some other
way.
â¢The charges that the Mayor makes
against me are utterly false so far as
accusation of impropriety is con
cerned. But even if they were true,
wbus;.' business is it to concern himself
about my private life? Suppose all
public officials were put to the test,
how many would you have left to run
th- government?
"Yes, I know Miss Viola Keeler and
she has be*>n at my house as a guest.
But the allegation that our relations
have in any way been improper is
without a vestige of truth. There are
six rooms in my home. I frequently
entertain at dinner. I often have
friends here at card parties. Am I to
hve like a hermit? Is a man to cut
himself off from all social life because
he is a member of the Police Board?
"I have never visited any woman at
235 O'Farrell street, as is alleged. I
have gone to play cards with men who
have apartments there, but never was
in the company of any woman in the
hotel. 1 repeat that the Mayor has un
justly accused me.
.<â¢**! was appointed to the commission
three years ago by the same Mayor
who has now removed me. I became
interested in the labor union movement
and worked hard for Schmitz and the
ticket in the first campaign. We got
along harmoniously for a year. Later
discord came between us. I fought for
the removal of the big nlckei-in-the
slot machines from the salbons. Schmitz
.tried to have me desist, but I stuck to
what I regarded my duty.
COULD NOT BE HANDLED.
"The Mayor learned that I was a
man who could not be swerved once
my mind was made up that I was
right. It was not long till the admin
istration let me alone, and I was one
of them no more. My activities in
seeking to expose police corruption in
Chinatown, my attitude against the
French restaurants and the inability
of the administration to control me
were responsible for the action of the
Mayor to-day.
"I have not given the matter serious
thought, but I do not think I will
make any contest cf my dismissal. My
term would expire in another year, and
a suit could not be adjudicated much
before that time. I did not go to the
meeting of the Commissioners to-night.
There was no use going down there
and making any fuss abcut it."
Commissioner Hutton has long been
a difficult and somewhat mysterious
factor for Mayor Schmits and his ad
ministration to deat with. The Com
missioner has been disposed to antag
onize the administration. He was nev
er content with the ordinary enforce
â¢ ment of the law. but seeking, it
appeared, to discredit the administra
tion's conduct of the government. His

battles against vice were more or less
of the suectacular order and gave the
impression that the public officials
were net doing their duty. Having
been appointed to office by the admin
istration, Hutton is regarded as hav
ing been unfair in making political en
terprise to place it in bad odor before
the public.
MAYOR'S LANGUAGE STRONG.
The Mayor does not mince words in
his reason for removing Hutton, but
cites specific instances of the latter's
indiscretions with women. Hutton's
name in the notice is coupled princi
pally with that of Viola Keeler, who
lives at the St. Andre House, at 1230
Pine street. The notice of removal con
tinues:
Some weeks azo information was officially
brought before me. and charges were made,
that in takinz certain Official action and in
making certain official declarations, ostensibly
In the interest of the good morals Of the
community, Police Commissioner Hutton was
actuated by private malice and personal in
terest and not by a sincere desire ior a bet
terment of the city's moral condition. That
he was himself personally a most immoral
man. That he was in the habit of visiting
disorderly houses with female companions of
more or less renutabllity, and that he was
in the habit of accepting hospitality and of
drinking wine at these pieces without paying
therefor.
Evidence of the truth of these charges, with
times and places of occurrence, was submitted
to me at the time, but preferring to satiety
myself absolutely of the truth of these heinous
charges before taking any action. I merely
stated that I Would consider the matter
further. Since then, without any reference
whatever to th* original sources of informa
tion, and on evidence Independent of and un
connected therewith, the facts then stated
have not only been confirmed in their en
tirety, but have been Intensified, and I now
have no hesitancy whatever in revoking the
commission of H. W. Hutton and removing
him from office, with the most profound re
gret that I should ever have been misled into
appointing as a conservator of the public mor.
als of this city one who is so thoroughly un
worthy.
The Mayor's notice further charges
that Hutton's acquaintance with Miss
Viola Keeler began when she was only
15 years old.
HAVE HOT SESSION.
It was shortly after 4 o'clock when
Hutton called on the Mayor in response
to the latter's summons. When Hutton
was handed a copy of the notice of re
moval he became very much excited.
He deniea the charges contained in the
notice and used the vilest kind of lan
guage in doing so.
"I have called you here," said the
Mayor, "to hand you personally this
communication, which is a notice of
your removal."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 26, 1905.
"Thank you." said Hutton, and after
reading the paper Hutton continued:
"I say in reply that this is not true,
that it is a lie: but if it were true, it is
none of your business."
"That is all right," said the Mayor,
"but I have absolute proof for every
word that is written there."
"I say again it is not true," said Hut
ton. "You have hired two disreputable
people in this matter, and I wish you
joy- of your job."
"That is enough," said the Mayor, in
terrupting Hutton. "Had you acted
with any decency I might have been
willing to have given you a chance to
resign."
"Talk of resigning." said Hutton,
"you have already said this was the
notice of my removal. How can I re
sign?"
Then the Mayor, becoming angered
at Hutton's frequent use of vile epi
thets, said:
"I have not yet sent the communica
tion, a. copy of which you have, to the
Board of Supervisors. Now I shall
send it immediately."
"1 shall say that I expected this,"
said Hutton, "and I will say that I
will occupy a political position when
you are gone."
'That is enough," said the Mayor,
and rang for Policeman Pete Fanning,
to whom he handed a copy of the com
plaint, telling him to take it to the
Supervisors at once.
"I won't own to it," said Hutton. "I
wish you joy of your Job. lam much
obliged to you," and Hutton took his
hat and left the office.
I was informed." said lahe Mayor in
a statement, "of the acts of Hutton as
far back as last June. I paid no at
tention to the charges, but set about
investigating the matter on my own
account. From information I have re
ceived I can say that every charge
made against Hutton is true. There
is more behind that I have not made
public.
"I consider Hutton wholly unfit for
public office, and I am sorry that I
did not have knowledge of his true
character before I appointed him three
years ago. I deem It my duty at this
time when Hutton stands in the public
light as a great purist and is posing as
a reformer to make the result of my
investigations known and to remove
him from his office for what I consider
good and sufficient cause."
MAYOR FILES HIS CHARGES.

TRIES IN VAIN
TO KILL WIFE
French Miller Stabs Woman
Four Times and Policeman
Prevents Cowardly Murder
ASSAULT ENDS QUAERE L
Victim Alleges Dozen Men
Stood By and Watched Her
Being Repeatedly Stabbed
French Miller, a furniture man,
made a dastardly but vain attempt to
murder his wife, Lizzie Miller, on Mc-
Allister street, near Leavenworth,
last night. The prompt action of
Policeman T. F. O'Connell saved the
woman's life.
Last night Miller went to his wife's
rooma at 38 McAllister street. The j
pair had been separated since last j
September. Miller wanted to get his
wife to return to him. She refused j
and a quarrel ensued. The infuriated \
husband attacked her with a knife, i
Mrs. Miller ran down into the street
and into the Glen Ada saloon, at Mc-
Allister and Leavenworth streets. She
â ought the protection of the pro
proprietor, Tony Ashton, but says that
he ordered her out.
As the woman emerged from the j
saloon Miller pounced on her. He j
stabbed her through the left ear, and j
as she raised her arms his descending
blade tore a great gash in each hand. j
The frenzied man then placed his j
knee on his wife's prostrate body and .
made a slash at her breast. The j
blade made a superficial wound. He
raised the weapon again, and in all
probability would have reached her
heart had not Policeman O'Connell
seised his hand. Mrs. Miller says a
dozen men stood by and saw her hus
band assault her.
Miller was locked un at the City
Hall station on a charge of assault
to commit murder. Mrs. Miller's in
juries were dressed at the hospital by
Dr. Kucich, who says they are not j
serious. â¢

WOMAN FINDS
A DEAD BABY?
Mrs. M. Spickman Rushes
Into Hospital and Declares
She Has Corpse in Basket
SURPRISES ATTENDANTS
German Lady's Imaginative
Brain Creates a Furor at
the Central Emergency
Â«
"Gentlemen, there is a dead baby in
this basket."
The foregoing information was con
veyed to Dr. Kucich at the Central
Emergency Hospital last night, and it
is unnecessary to say he was startled.
Shortly after 7 o'clock a middle-aged
German lady, carrying a large tel
escope basket, rushed breathlessly into
the hospital. Laying her burden on
the operating table. Mrs. Martha
Spickmanâfor that was her name â
said: 'Open it; open it. You will find
it there. Can't you tell that it is
there?"
Then the woman sank exhausted Into
a chair and covered her face with
her hands. She did not want to see
the poor little corpse; but Dr. Kucich
and Steward Dan Barry made an in
vestigation.
"You open* it. Dan," said the doctor.
"Not for mine," quoth the steward.
Ambulance Driver McCarty then vol
unteered to do the job. Everybody
peered with curiosity at the basket as
McCarty opened it. A pink chemise
first came to light. A bundle of clothes
âJust the kind that would inclose a
dead babyâwas then disclosed. More
clothes were removed âa lady's waist,
then some underwear, a gaudy pair of
stockings, next a nightgown, some
more chemisesâblue ones this timeâ
and finally the last garment was held
up for inspection, but no baby was in
sight.
Mrs. Splckman seemed relieved.
"Well, there is something mysterious
about It anyway," she said. Every one
sighed. Belief was experienced by all
and the hospital staff knew that there
had not been a tragedy.
Mrs. Spickman lives on a small ranch
near Palo Alto. She spotted the bas
ket by a telegraph pole at Golden
Gate avenue and Jones street. For an
hour she watched. Lurid scenes of
murder and mystery flitted through her
brain. Hf r gÂ«ze pierced the wicker
ware, and she thought she saw a
corpse. Horrois!
Mrs. Spickman felt that she had done
her duty, and with a self-satisfied sigh
she retired from the hospital with the
parting repetition:
"Well, there was something mysteri
ous about it anyway."
EDNA WALLACE HOPPER
ATTENDS WILL PROCEEDINGS
Present for n Short While at Duns
muir Hearing in Consul Ben
tictt's Office.
The monotonous cross-examination
of J. J. Dwyer, the expert on Califor
nia probate law, by Sir Charles H. Tup
per, in the Dunsmuir will contest was
suddenly interrupted yesterday morn
ing, when the fair and :*etite tontest
ant appeared in a dainty gown and
black picture hat and listened for
half an hour to the attempts of Sir
Charles to catch the expert in clev
erly laid trans.
Following the adjournment of the
morning session Mrs. Hopper was es
corted by Judge Coyne, her attorney,
and Sir Charles Tupper to her hotel.
The entire afternoon was taken up
with the cross-examination of Dwyer,
whose answers to questions were not
very satisfactory to his questioner.
An interesting feature of the case
is that the marriage of Dwyer took
place yesterday, and to-day will prob
ably be his last appearance on the
stand to answer the questions of Sir
Charles. It is expected that Mr. Bod
well's examination will keep Dwyer
on the stand for several days.
