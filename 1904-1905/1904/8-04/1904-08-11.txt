NEWPORT. R. I., Aug. 10.â The
United States gunboat Hist was beaten
this afternoon by the submarine boat
Shark in a sham attack off Brentoris
Reef lightship, under conditions that
favored the gunboat.
The Shark, upon which a new peri
scope was being tried, dived near the
torpedo station, and, after running two
miles submerged, came to the surface
within ninety yards of her target,
which, it is considered, could have
been sunk without those on board ever
knowing what struck them.
Lieutenant England and his crew
were observing on the Hist, but they
failed to locate the enemy until she
came up well within striking distance.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
elected aroused instant interest, which
increased to marked enthusiasm when
the speaker went on to explain his posi
tion. Then the crowd seemed to yield
to the force of his reasoning, and at the
end of a particularly telling period to
ward the close of the speech it gave the
candidate the greatest demonstration of
the afternoon. It looked as though
every man, woman and child in the
throng surrounding' the platform had a
small American flag, and as they
cheered the waving flags almost con
cealed the occupants of the stand.
As Judge Parker spoke his closing
words the band struck up "The S tar-
Spangled. Banner," and- from the deck
of the yacht Sapphire a number of
rockets were . fired. . These, bursting in
the air, released . parachutes. Later
there , were salutes from the Sagamore
and August Belmont's yacht.
After the ceremony all crowded up
eagerly to shake the candidate's hand
and, to . congratulate . him upon his
speech. . ' :T. â¢.Â¦

ST. PETERSBURG. Aug. 10.âGen
eral Kuropatkin's forces have suffered
serious reverses. Such Is the news that
has come to my knowledge from an ex
cellent source, but which is as yet with
held from the public. I am therefore
unable to give details further than tc
say that matters look very black for
the commander in chief, although I am
assured that he has neither been cap
tured nor wounded.

When he enunciated this principle
there came a burst of cheers that
caused the speaker to wait a few;min
utes before -he continued. His' pledge
not to accept ' a second term if hÂ« wan
for none," said Clark, and the specta
tors showed their appreciation of, the
sally by a shout of laughter.
While Judge Parker was speaking
there was no need of shelter. The
rain stopped and not a breath of air
stirred. In the stillness every word
could be heard distinctly to the farth
est borders of the crowd.
It is long years since Judge Parker
had been heard in a political speech
and to most of his hearers he was ab
solutely new in this capacity. They
heard him with a keen interest, not
unmixed with curiosity. The address
was delivered .in the clearest tones, in
a voice which was hardly raised above
a conversational pitch, but fairly audi
ble nevertheless. His delivery was ex
ceedingly deliberate. He used few ges
tures, making his emphasis almost en
tirely with his voice. He adhered to
the text of his written address, with
the wording ' of which he appeared
perfectly familiar, though he had a
copy in his hand and followed It
somewhat closely with his eye while
speaking:
The speech was heard with closest
attention and applause frequently
punctuated it. The candidate's audi
ence awoke to a high pitch of enthusi
asm when he spoke of imperialism
and militarism.
"Our world power," said he, "as
such must be maintained, but I deny
that it is at all recently that the Unit
ed States has attained that eminence."

Standing bareheaded during a brief
loll In the rainstorm, which had lasted
since soon after daylight. Judge Parker
accepted the nomination and set forth
his views in a speech that evoked fre
quent and hearty applause. He spoke
for a little more than a half -hour.
The ceremony was held on the lawn
at Rosemount, under the trees at the
north of the house, and was attended
by upward of 600 'persons, the larger
number of whom came from New York
with the committee on the steamship
Sagamore. The company included many
Democrats of national promlnenece, as
well as a large and representative num
ber from Tammany Hall. There would
have been a gala-day gathering from
Kingston and vicinity, where perhaps
the Judge is best known, but the rain
had been so heavy and continuous that
few local residents ventured forth.
It was at first decided to hold the
ceremonies on the Sagamore, owing to
the storm, but the protest of those who
wanted , Judge Parker notified at his
own house was so vigorous that at the
last moment the little platform erected
on the Parker lawn was hastily deco
rated , with flags and the ceremonies
were held there, according to the orig
inal plan.
During most of the time occupied
by Champ Clark's speech the rain was
falling in a steady: drizzle, but it
stopped entirely just as Judge Parker
began his address and held oft until
he finished, v.
, Clark was speaking and Parker was
standing without shelter when a man
in the crowd called out: . ,
- "Somebody hold an umbrella over
Judge Parker."
A number were immediately offered,
but the â¢ Judge refused.

ST. PETERSBURG. Aug. 10.â Again
the chance of a decisive battle between
General Kuropatkin and the command
er of the Japanese army seems to be
disappearing. According to a statement
issued by 'the general staff to-night
rains are again falling throughout a
wide area of Manchuria, with the pros
pect of impeding operations, but even
more Important is the information re
ceived to-night from an exceptional
source that the Japanese have once
more delayed too long.
General Kuropatkin has now with
drawn the bulk of h!s army safely
north of Liaoyang. leaving only a
strong rear line to contest the advance
when it comes.
According to this information the
Japanese have about 300,000 men in the
armies operating against Kuropatkin.
rendering It too hazardous for him to
risk a general engagement.
The general staff has no information
bearing on the reported presence of a
large force of Japanese at Paithuhi. a
place that cannot be located on avail
able maps. The report agYees, however,
with the general tenor of the Informa
tion received by the pressâ that Gen
eral Kuro'catkin is already retreating
north of Liaoyang.

ST. LOUIS, Aug. 10.â Harry Jones, a
checkman' in the office of the St. Louis
Transfer Company, was arrested to
day for grand larceny oh complaint of
August Kleinert, a "World's Fair visit
or from California.
Kleinert, his wife and daughter, ar
rived here July 30. At the Union Sta
tion he was surrounded by hotel run
ners, cab drivers and baggage men.
After escaping from the crowd he
missed his three return tickets to San
Francisco.
Kleinert not only reported his loss
to the police, but cleverly played de
tective for himself, daily visiting the
ticket brokers' offices and inquiring for
tickets to San Francisco by the route
designated in the transportation he had
lest.
A ticket broker named Marmaduke
yesterday offered to sell Kleinert three
tickets bearing the names of himself,
wife and- daughter. Kleinert reported
the fact to the police, who seized the
tickets, which they learned had been
sold to the broker by Jones.
Special Dispatch to The GaU.
LASSA, Tibet, Aug. 5.â Yesterday, tor
the first time in history. British troops
marched through the streets of T^a .Â¦*Â«;-â¢*_
the occasion being a ceremonial visit
by Colonel Younghusband, the civil
commissioner accompanying the British
expedition to the Chinese Amban.
The troops, while en route to the
city, passed at the foot of the Dalai
Larria's great palace on Mount Potala,
about three miles Â¦west of Lass a, and
through the fields to the outskirts of
the city. Then they passed through the
Chinese quarter, which was swarming
with pigs, and entered the city proper.
The Amban's smart guard of honor
received Colonel Younghusband, who
had an hour's interview with the Chi
nese representative. The Amban la
n-ented the clannish ignorance and low
cunning displayed by the Tibetans in
their foreign dealings.
On its leturn to the camp the mission
passed the Great Cathedral, or "The
Palace of the Gods." The streets were
filthy.
Reports still vary as to the where
abouts of the Dalai Lama and M. Dor
jeieff, his Russian adviser. The peopie
displayed the greatest curiosity to see
the British, swarming in the side
Ftreets and climbing on roofs to get a
better view. To-day there were 400
Lassans outside the camp, and they
did an enormous trade, selling veget
ables, sweets and sugar.
The chiefs to-day objected to a pro
posal that the British occupy the sum
mer palace, alleging that it is the same
as a temple. The chiefs promise that
the national assembly will appoint del
egates to negotiate with the British,
and that their arts will be fully binding
upon the Dalai Lama and the people.

NEW YORK. Aug. 10. â It has been
decided by Coroner Scholer to hold an
inquest on" Friday afternoon into the
cause of the death of Miss Bertha
Marion Dolbeer, the wealthy and
eccentric California woman, who was
killed on July 9 by falling from the
ninth floor of the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel, and whose will gave her entire
estate, valued at about $1, 000,000, to
Miss E. Marion Warren. A dozen per
sons have tried to contest the will. Dr.
O. O. Schultz, the Coroner's physi
cian, who performed an autopsy on
the body, reported the case one of sui
cide.
Miss E. Marion Warren, the sole
witness of the tragedy and the life
long friend and constant companion
of Miss Dolbeer, is in California and
her testimony, in the form of an af
fidavit, will be ready to be shown to
the jury. The affidavit is in part as
follows:
"On the afternoon of July 9, be
tween 4 and 5 o'clock. Miss Dolbeer
sat on the sill of a hall window of the
Waldorf- Astoria Hotel on the ninth
floor, awaiting the arrival of her
physician. Later we wfent to our
rooms and had some conversation
about our plans for the following day
Miss Dolbeer then left the room and
went out into the hall, saying she
wanted to open the window to get
MÂ«ne fresh air. I followed her and
just saw her body fail out of the win
dew. I do not know whether her fall
was accidental or suicidal." .

Seclusion,
VICTOR, Colo., Aug. 10.â Rev. T. S.
Leland, pastor of the Methodist Epis
copal church of this city and known as
the "cowboy preacher," was this morn
ing waited, upon by a committee of
three and ordered to leave town on or
before 8:30 o'clock. The preacher is
still here.
Non-union men object to the parson
for the reason that he has repeatedly
expressed himself as being on their
side, provided always that they keep
within the law. But the present ques
tion, the pastor says, hinges upon a
man's right to hold an opinion.
Mr. Leland is a dead shot. He nays
his wife is a better one. Both are
armed with rifles and revolvers in their
own home, waiting for intruders. In
the meantime the city officials have
posted a score of guards to protect the
clergyman.
The committee that waited upon Mr.
Leland told him that, provided he did
not leave quickly, he would surely re
ceive the same treatment as that ad
ministered to his friend and neighbor,
John Harper. The latter, a former
president of the Victor Miners' Union
and late manager of the Miners' Union
store in this city, was one of the de
ported unionists. He returned to the
camp yesterday. Last night he was
seized at his home by a party of masked
men and driven out of the district.
Harper's son Archie,- about 21 years of
age, was compelled to accompany him.
Young Harper, however, was brought
back an hour later.
Harper telephoned to his family to
day that he was at Canon .City, to
which place he had been compelled to
walk after being beaten and robbed of
$10.
It Is charged that one of the men
who took Harper from his home last
night struck Mrs. Harper as she at
tempted to kiss her husband.

CHEFU, Aug. 11, 7:30 A. M.â A Russian torpedo-boat destroyer entered Chefu harbor at 5:30 o'clock this morning and reported that six Russian battleships, four
cruisers and half of the torpedo-boats escaped from Port Arthur yesterday morning. The torpedo-boat destroyer left Port Arthur last .night, bringing five passengers, who said
that the Japanese fleet was pursuing the Russians, and that a battle on the open sea was expected.
TOKIO, Aug. ii (na. m.) â Evidently driven to sea by the fire of the Japanese land batteries, the Russian fleet emerged from Port Arthur. yesterday morning. Admiral Togo immediately closed in on it and opened a se
vere engagement, which lasted until nightfall. Afterward the Japanese destroyers and torpedo flotilla delivered a series of attacks. The Japanese fleet withdrew during the night. A guardship stationed off the harbor reported that she say
at dawn to-day the battleships Retvizan and Pobieda steaming toward the harbor of Port Arthur. Admiral Togo has not yet reported the results of yesterday's engagement. It is thought here that the Russians attempted to escape seaward
from a base which is no longer tenable, but they again refused to attempt to force Admiral Togo's lines. Details are hourly expected. â¢ Â» Â» ti

In the evening a strange woman ap

with her a little boy that bore every re

wore the clothing, shoes and hat that
Burton wore during the day. A few
minutes prior to this a strange man
appeared and said he knew where the

certain amount of money.
The man and woman both disap
peared, and on returning to their home
Mr. and Mrs. Melone discovered for the

DUBLIN, Aug. 10.â It was clearly

He enjoys a great deal of affectionate
loyalty among his constituents in Cork

sides, but the general sense of the
country is behind Redmond, Dillon,

be paid for Irish land and the best
way to prevent the landlords from ob

J'ORTE SENDS MESSAGE
TO A31KRICAX MINISTER
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 10.âDis
counting the fall of Port Arthur and
the disastrous defeat of General Kuro
patkin at the hands of the combined
Japanese armies, some diplomats are
already speculating \ipon the situation
in which the combatants would be left
and the question as to whether
it is possible, that a way would
be opened for peace. The almost unan
imous opinion is that, with her present
record of victories -combined with the
financial difficulties of continuing the
war indefinitely, Japan would welcome
peace, and the almost equal unanimous
verdict is that Russia would 'adopt a
contrary course. Even should every
Russian soldier be driven out of Man
churia the diplomats- believe Russia
could not afford to yield, but would be
compelled to doggedly continue the
war, collect another army In Siberia
and take the offensive next year.
Several keen diplomats, however, are
of the opinion that Japan, by a clever
coup in the event of Kuropatkin being
routed, might perhaps force the powers
to intervene in a way that Russia
could not resist. One diplomat repre
senting a European power at the court
of Emperor Nicholas said:
"Secretary Hay's note opening a way
for the guarantee for the administra
tive entity of China, to which all of the
powers subscribed in principle, may
after all become the means of bringing
about peace. If Japan, pushing the
Russian military forces out of Manchu
ria and obtaining undisputed posses
sion, should then formally relinquish
the province to China, its real owner,
and call upon the powers under their
guarantee to protect the entity of the
Celestial empire, I do not think the
powers could escape responsibility."
Diplomats Anticipate Fall
of Port Arthur and Disas
ter to Kuropatkin's Army
tucre.ss of which was demonstrated this
evening by the bad news announced in
the beginning of this dispatch. It is
further known that another danger is
threatening, as the Japanese, without
losing a moment's time, have dis
patched several detachments up the
Liao River, which must needs seriously
threaten the Russian rear on the west
tide, as General Kuroki has done on the
east as far as Mukden. Simultaneously
cpecial telegrams from Liaoyang have
told of sudden activity on the part of
the Chunchuses and to animosity dis
played by the Chinese population,
"which is apparently now throwing off
the mask.

Â¦ 2^ Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
DES MOINES, lovva, Aug. 10.â After
three weeks of mystery that has agi
tated the entire State it has been estab
lished that Mrs. Aliene Butterfield of
Greene County was not murdered by
her husband, as was supposed. She ran
away from home because she learned
that her husband preferred another
woman, one old enough to be his
mother.
Mrs. Butterfield would never have
bfen located but for the fact that she
read a newspaper account of an at
tempt to lynch her husband as her sup
posed murderer. When he reappeared
at Butterfleld's farm after having de
serted her three months ago and left
his wife to raise 160 acres of corn sin
gle-handed, the indignation of the
neighbors found expression hi the or
ganization of a mob, and the Sheriff
was barely able to avert a tragedy.
Bloody clothes were found In a field
and it was taken as conclusive evidence
that a murder had been committed.
Mrs. Butterfield determined to save
her husband and wrote a letter to the
Sheriff assuring him that she was alive.
The Sheriff came to Des Moines to-day
and after a long search found the
woman. . >

The naval officer intimates that the

Captain Kostchavoski said further
that the Russian torpedo boats, gun
boats and small craft generally re
mained at Port Arthur. Some came
out to perform their usual duties In
ihe vicinity, but they did not follow
the* bis ships.
Captain Rostchavoski said that the
recent firing heard at Chefu evidently
*came from Port Arthur, where the
Japanese' continued to attack daily
\vi;h scarcely less energy than they
manifested during the severe three
days' lighting: the latter part of July.
The Japanese line, he said, now ex
tended from the north shore of Louise
Bay to a point immediately east of
Tache Bay, about seven miles east of
3'ort Arthur.
. The Japanese, he alleged, were wast
ing lives with reckless courage. Their
positions were frequently lost, retaken,
then lost and retaken again.

BLOOD CKLXS.
tK HXALTH. CÂ« DISEASE.
-Ian is a millionaire many times over in
the possession of blood cells. Woman is
not quite so rich, for scientists have proven
that the norical comber of red blood cells
in adult nen is five million; in women four
end a half million, to the square millimeter.
The normal cell is not absolutely round
in health, but, in disease, becomes ejt-
tremely irregular in shape. Every one can
be in perfect health ana possess the mil-
lions of ricb<Â«ed blood corpuscles if they
only know how to go about it Dr. R. V.
Pierce, consulting physician to the Inva-
lids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, at Buf-
falo," N. Y., advises every man and woman
to prepare for a long life by observing na-
ture's laws. In the first place, if your
digestion is faulty, and the food you
eat is not taken up by the blood and assim-
ilated properly, you need a tonic and diges-
tive corrector, something that will increase
the red blood corpuscles; he believes in
roing about this in nature's own way.
Years Â«go, in his active practice, he found
that an alterative extract of certain herbs
and roots, put vp without the use of alco-
* hoi, would put the liver, lungs and heart
into fuller and more complete action. This
jnedicine he called Dr. Pieree'w Golden
Medical Discovery. By assimilating the
food eaten, it nourishes the blood, and, in-
etead of the ill-shaped corpuscles, the per-
eon r 8 blood takes on a rich red color and
the corpuscles are more nearly round.
Nervousness is only the cry of the 6tarved
nerves for food, and when the nerves are
led on rich red blood the person loses
those irritable feelings, sleeps well at night
c-d feels refreshed in the morning.
KNOWLEDGE IS POWER.

As I have already proceeded at too great

humbled In tbelr presence. . .
For fifty years, with the exception of the
war with Mexico, this country had b*en at
peace, with a standing army most of the time
flf less than 10.000 men. He who thinks that
the nation had grown effeminate during that
period should read the casualty rolls of the
armies on either side of Shlloh, Antletam,
Fredericksburg and Gettysburg, at ' Stone
River and at Chlckamauga. I would be the
last man to pluck a single laurel from the
crown of any one of the military heroes to
whom this country owes so much, but I Insist
that their most heroic deeds ' proceeded Infin
itely more from devotion to the country than
from martial spirit.
We are not a military people bent on con
quest or engaged In extending our domains
in foreign lands, or desirous of securing nat
ural advantages, however great, by force: but
a people loving peace not only for ourselves
but for all the nations of the earth. The dis
play of great military armaments may please
the rye and for the moment excite the pride
of the citizen, but It cannot bring to the
country the brains, brawn and muscle of a
single Immigrant r.or Induce the investment
here of a dollar of capital. Of course, such
armament as may be necessary for the se
curity of the country and the protection of
the rights of its citizens at home and abroad
must be maintained. Any ether course would
be not only false economy but pusllanimous.
I protest, however, against the feeling, now
far too prevalent, that by reason of the com
manding position we have assumed In the
world, we must take part In the disputes and
broils of foreign countries, and that because
we have grown great we t'hould Intervene In
every important question that arises In other
parts of the world. I also protest against. the
erection of any such military establishments
as would be required to maintain the coun
try in that attitude. We should confine our
International activities solely ' to matters in
which the rights of our- country or of -.our
citizens are directly Involved. That Is not a'
situation of isolation, but of independence.'. 7
The Government of the United States was'
organized solely for the people of the United
States. While it was contemplated that this
country should become a refuge for the op
pressed oP every land who might be fit to
discharge the duties of. our citizenship, and
while we have always sympathized with the
people of every nation in their struggles for
sell-government, the Government was not cre
ated for a career of political or civilizing
evangelisation in foreign countries or among
alien race?. The most efficient work we can
do in uplifting the people of other countries Is
by the presentation of a happy, prosperous,
self-governing nation as an Ideal to be emu
lated, a model to be followed. The general
occupation of our citizens in the arts of peace
or In the absence of large military armaments
tends to impair neither patriotism nor physical
courage, and for the truth of this I refer the
young men of to-day to the history of the Civil
war.
NOT HKNT UPON' CONQUEST.
It is the liberty, the advancement and the
prosperity of Its citizens, net any career ot
conquest, that raake the country a world
power. This condition we owe to the- bounty
of Providence, unfolded In the great natural
resources of the country, to the wisdom of our
fathers manifested in the form of government
established by them, to the energy, Industry,
moral character and law-abiding spirit of the
people themselves.

At the very threshold of this response and

nomination for the Presidency â the
first expression of his political views â
is herewith riven in full:
ESOPUS, Aug. 10. â In notifying
Judge Parker of his nomination for
the Presidency Hon. Champ Clark
acted as spokesman for the commit
tee appointed by the St. Louis con
vention. Clark said: !
Judge Parker: The most momentous pollti- i
cal performance known among men is thf j
quadrennial election of an American Presi
dent. The supreme executive power of SO.OOO.
000 free people changes hands with elmpleet
ceremony and most perfect order. While the
contest for votes is waged with earnestness
and enthusiasm â sometimes with much heat
and bitterness â the ready acceptance of tho
result by the defeated is the surest augury
of the perpetuity of our Institutions.
Presidents come and Presidents go, but the
great republic, freighted with the hopes of th-.
human race for liberty, goes on forever. j
AH history proves that a government bot
tomed on popular suffrage is a government by
party. Experience shows that he serves his
party best who serves his country best. The
names most fondly cherished are these of men
who devoted their time, their energies, . their
talents, their fortunes and their lives to the
promotion of the public weal-. Stronger In
centive to high and patriotic endeavor no man
hath than the hope to stand through all thÂ«Â»
ages In that goodly company: â¢ '
Out of the masterly debates and profound
deliberations of the St. Louis convention
emerged a reunited .party, which goes forth
conquering and to conquer. The flower of the
Democracy assembled there to consult on the
state of the cougtry and to take measures for
restoring tne Government to the principles
enunciated by the fathers, from which it has
drifted far. In these latter days.
PARTY WELL REPRESENTED, j j
Every phase of Democratic opinion was rep- t
resented by brave, honest and able champions ,
in that great conclave of free and patriotic (
men.
The St. Louis convention carried out no cut
and dried . programme. Its delegates weÂ«J not
mere automatons or marionettes waving and
talking when the strings were pulled by one
man. Speech and action were absolutely free,
and the great debates which took place there
will constitute part of the permanent political
literature of the country. No effort was made
to gag or bridle any one. If a delegate had a
pet Idea which he was anxious to exploit he
was given an adequate and respectful hearing
before either the platform committee or the
entire convention. Every man had his say.
To none was opportunity denied. Out of It
all grew such unity as encourages lovers of;
liberty and of pure government everywhere.
' We enter upon this campaign with the
strength which grows. out of the union of a
'mighty party: with the enthusiasm born of
truth, with the courage that emanates from
' a righteous cause, with the confidence of men
animated \)y noble purposes and lofty patriot
ism.
The principles of Democracy are grounded In
eternal truth. As formulated Â¦ by the father
of Democracy they are not for a day, but for
all time, and are as applicable in this hour
as when he pmclaimed them In his first in
augural address, which has become a classic.
The necessity of putting them * Into practice
is as nresslng now as it was then. To once
more make them the basis of our political ac
tion is thn pleasant but arduous task assigned
you by the Democracy of the land.
AIMS OF DEMOCRACY.
To serve the whole American people, with
out discrimination, faithfully and well; to
distribute the blessings of the Federal Govern
ment impartially among all our citizens; to
lighten the burdens of government by reduc
ing taxation to the minimum and by rigid
economy in the public service; to administer
the powers conferred by the constitution Justly,
wisely, fearlessly, vigorously and patriotic
ally, without diminution and without usurpa
tion; to maintain freedom of thought, free
dom of speech and freedom of the press; to
promote th e sacred cause of- human liberty
everywhere by the wholesomeness of our ex
ample; to vindicate and glorify the theory and
practice of representative government: to se
cure its blessings to our neÂ«,t<r!ty for all time
âthese ' always have been,' are and forever
must be the alms, and purposes of Democrats.
These alms and purposes have been care
fully, clearly and comprehensively set forth
In the declaration of principles which waa
ventlon In July last, by the platform com
ventlon in ujly last, by the Platform Com
mittee, after more than sixteen hours spent
In its consideration. In which every great live
Issue is frankly, boldly and fully discussed,
and which was unanimously and enthusiastic
ally adopted by that convention, composed of
delegates from every constituency under our
flag.
There, was a splendid array of Presidential
candidates before the St. Louis Convention,
supported by loyal friends and ardent ! ad
mirers. An unusually large number of men
were placed In .nomination for the greatly
; coveted honor. You were chosen with such
enthusiasm as foretells success. Having, on
the only ballot, received the two-thirds ma
jority Indispensable by Democratic usage, your
nomination was made unanimous with the
heartiest approval of your Illustrious com
petitors. "Absolute acquiescence In the de
cisions of the majority, the vital principle of
republics," has ever been a cardinal tenet
of Democracy, and the signs of the times
Indicate that you will be supported at the
polls by the Democratic hosts with the same
unanimity with which you were nominated.
SUPPORT OF ALL MEN.
The hope Is not too extravagant for enter
tainment that in this campaign our candidates
will have the support not only of every Dem
ocrat In the land, but also of every voter,
by whatever political name called, who believes
that the constitution of the United States Is a
living reality and that It applies equally to
highland low, great and small, to public of
ficial and to private citizen.
They will also be supported, let Â¦ us hope,
by 'all men. without regard to political af
filiations who favor maintaining the llnei
of demarcation between the .legislative. Ju
dicial and executive departments of the Gov
ernment, the separation of which has been
generally regarded as the most salutary and
dlfllcult achievement of the masterful states
men who framed the constitution. It is be
lieved and hoped that as President you will
use every legitimate Influence at your com
mand to restore and preserve the healthful
equilibrium. among the departments established
by the constitution.
The most marked characteristics of the bulk
of the American people are reverence for the
constitution and obedience to law.

He characterized a New York news

"Judge Parker," said the Speaker,
"had to send that telegram to satisfy

'CHAMP CLARK of Missouri, Chairman,
It also was signed by all other
members of the notification commit
tee. _
There need be no fear that the assertion so
often rnade of late that we have now become
a world power will then be without Â«upport
Ours is a world power, and as such it must
be maintained, but I deny that it is at all
recently that the United States has attained
that eminence. Our country became a world
power over a century ago. when., having
thrown off foreign domination, the people es
tablished a free government, the sources of
whose authority Rprung and was continually
to proceed from the will of the people vthem
eelver. It grew as a world power as its eturdy
citizens, to whose natural Increase were added
iirmiÂ»Tant'Â» from the old world seeking to ob
tain here the liberty and prosperity denied them
In their own country, spread over the race of
the land, reduced the prairies and forests to
cultivation, bui't cities, constructed highways
and railroads, till now a nation which at the
formation of the ' government numbered only
3.000.COO in. population hai grown, to 80.000,000
and from ocean - to ocean and from the lakes
to the gulf the country in the free, abode of
prosperous people advanced in the highest dÂ«-
Mrtm la the learning - of art* Â¦ of â¢ civilization.
Can we hope for the resnect of the civilized
world while proudly sruaranteeing to. every
citizen cf the United States that no law shall
rx> made or enforced which shall abridge the
privileges or Immunities of citizens, of the
United States or deny to any person the
*o,u:il protection of the laws, and at the same
time not only deny similar rights to the In
hahitants of the Philippines, but take away
from them the right of trial by Jury anjl
place their lives and the disposition of their
property in the keeping of those whom we
f-mi\ to them to bo their rrovernors? We shall
certainly rue it as a nation if we make Â«ny
such attempt. Viewing the question even
from the standpoint of national selfishnees,
thrre Is no prospect that the $20,000,000 ex
pended in the purchase* of. the Islands and the
$C..O.*v>.noo said to have been disbursed will
ever tome back to uj. The accident of war
brought the Philippines into our possession
and we arc not at liberty to disregard the
responsibility that came to us but that re
sponsibility will be best subserved by pre
paring the inlander* a* rapidly an possible for

LIBERTY FOR THE FIIJPIXOS.
It it a faci and i-hould be frankly con
ceded that though our party be successful in
the coming contest we cannot hope to secure
a majority of the Senate during the next four
}tars, and hence we &hall be unable to secure
Â»ny moditicauon in tne tari:i, M.vÂ« to which
the Republican majority in thf Senate may
consent. "While, therefore, we are unable to
give assurances of relief to the people from
such excessive duties as burden them it is
due to them that we state our position to be
in favor of a reasonable i eduction in the tar
iff; that we believe it is demandtd by the bÂ«st
Interests of both manufacturer and, consumer,
and that a wise and beneficent revision of the
laritT can be accomplished as soon as both
branches ol Congress aid an executive in fa
vor of it are elected, without creating that
sense of unomainty and inbtabllUy that has
on other occasions manUs-sted Itself. This
can be achieved by providing that such a rea
sonable period shall intervene between the
date of the enactment of the statute making
a revision and the date of its enforcement as
shall be deemed sufficient for the Industry or
business affected by such revision to adjust it
eelf to the changes and new conditions Im
posed. Eo confident am I in the belief that the
demand of the people for a reform of the
tariff is just that I indulge in the hope that
ehould a Democratic House of Representatives
and a Democratic executive be chosen by the
l-eople even a Republican Senate may heed
the warning and consent to give at least some
measure of relief to the people.
The combinations, popularly called trusts,
which aim to secure a monopoly of trade in
the necessaries of life as well as In those
things that are employed on the farm. In the
factory and in many other fields of Industry,
have been encouraged and stimulated by ex
cessive tariff duties. These operate to furnish
a substantial market in the necessities of
80.C00.C0o of people by practically excluding
competition. "With so large a market and
highly remunerative prices continuing long
after the line of possible competition would
naturally be reached the temptation of all en
gaged in the same business to combine, so as
to prevent competition abroad and a resulting
reduction of prices, has proved irresistible In
a number of cases. All men must agree that
the- natural result of enacting laws that foster
ruch inequitable conditions In most unfortunate
for the people as a whole, and it would seem
a3 If all ought to agree that the effective
remedy would bÂ« to appropriately modify the
offending law.
The growth of monopoly, of which com
plaint Is Justly made, cannot Justly be laid, at
the doors of the courts of this country. The
decisions cf th? Suprpme Court of the United
States, the Court of Appeals of this State and
the court of last resort in many other States
warrant the assertion that the common law
as developed affords a complete legal remedy
acalnst monopolies. The fact that they have
multlnlled In number and incrpased in power
has been due net to the failure of the courts
to apply the law whrn properly moved by ad
m!nl*tratlvÂ» officials cr private Individuals,
but to the failure of officials charged with the
duty of enforcing the law to take the neces
sary procedure to procure the Judirment of the
courts 1n the appropriate Jurisdiction, coupled
Â¦with thÂ» fact that thÂ» legislative departments
of rots* of cur State governments as well as

CAXXOT WIX THE SENATE.
ify ihe latter claes. With absolute control of
both legislative and executive departments of
the Government since March 4. lb'JT. there has
been neither, reduction nor an attempt at re
duction in tariff duties. It Is not unreason
able to assume, in the light of that record,
that a Ituure Congress of that party will not
undertake a revision cf the tariff downward
in the event that it shall receive an Indorse
ment o: its past course on that subject by the
people.
The foregoing suggestion* but emphasize the
distinction which exists between our own and
many other forms of government. It has been
well cald, in substance, that there are but
two powers in government â one the power of
the sword, sustained by the hand that wields
it, and the other the power of the law, sus
tained by an enlightened public sentiment. The
difference In the powers Is the difference in
the republic â such as powers, based on law
and a written constitution, supported by Intel
ligence and patriotism â and a monarchy, sus
tained by force exerted by an Individual, un
controlled by laws other than those made or
sanctioned by him; cne represents constitu
tionalism. thÂ« other imperialism.
The present tariff law Is unjust In Its opera
tion, excessive in many rates and eo framed
in particular instances aa to exact Inordinate
profits from the people. So well understood
has this view become that many prominent
members of the Republican party and at least
two of ita State conventions have dared to
voice the eeneral sentiment on that subject.
That rarty seerr.s. however, to be collectively
abie to harmonize only upon a plank that ad
mits that revision may from time to time be
IWW Â¦ Â¦ I jr. but is eo phrased that it is expectod
to be satisfactory to these in favor of an
Increase or tho^a who favor a reduction thereoi
and to those opposed to any change whatever.
Judged by the record of performance, rather
than that of promise on the part of that party
in the rast. it would seem as if the outcome
in the event cf its success would be to grat-
the failure of government to protect the citi
zen and hie property, which not only justi
fied the action of your convention In this re
gard, but made it Its duty to call attention
to the fact that constitutional guarantees are
violated whenever any citizen is denied the
ripht 10 labor, to acquire and to enjoy prop
erly, or to reside where his Interests or incli
nation may determine; and the fulfillment of
the asKurunoe to rebuke and punieh ail de
nials of these rights, whether brought about
by individuals or government agencies, shield
be enforced by every official and supported
by every citizen. The essence of. good govern
ment lies in strict observance ot constitutional
limitation?, enforcement cf law and order and
rugged opposition to all encroachment upon
the eoverelKnty of the people.

MEN TO WATCH ECLIPSE
ALAMEDA, Aug. 10. â Fire to-night
burned the Graham stables, owned by
r: H. McMillan, on Sherman street,
near Central avenue. Twenty-two
horses perished and thirty-five vehi
cles, with harness, hay and grain, were
destroyed. The large two-story frame
building occupied by the stables was
swept clean.
Besides this loss a two-stoiy frame
building adjoining the stables, owned
by Frank Moulton of Palo Alto and
occupied by Frank Tern pieman, was
badly injured. Two cottages owned
and occupied by Antone Vaccarezza
at 1416 and 1418 Sherman street were
damaged, as was C. A. Fortner's res
idence at 1217 Central avenue, owned
by Syz & Co. of San Francisco.
The total loss is $20,0001 From the
stables ten horses and four or five
vehicles were saved. McMillan's loss
will reach $15,000 to $17,500. Fire
men had great difficulty in handling
the flames. The only steam fire en
gine Alameda owns was in a repair
shop and out of commission. The de-*.
partment was compelled to work
with the ordinary hydrant pres
sure, which was so low that a stream
of water would not reach the second
story of the burning buildings. It was
only by strdnuous effort that a disas
trous spread of the five was prevented.
The fire broke out in a room in the
stable occupied by the employes as a
sleeping apartment.
Al Bray, a stableman, saw the sud
den outbreak at 9:45 o'clock. He- was
at the rear of the big barn. Bray ran
to the firehouse, not fifty feet away, on
Sherman street and gave the alarm.
The hose company responded quickly,
but the whole structure was afire be
fore the water was in service. A gen
eral alarm was sounded and brought
the entire department po the scene.
Volunteers tried to save the live stock,
but not more than one-third of the
horses escaped. Most of these, as well
as the vehicles and harness destroyed,
belonged to individuals who kept their
stock at the stable. The fire made such
headway that the firemen ex*erted
themselves to save the neighboring res
idences. Insurance was carried on the
damaged dwellings. McMillan's insur
ance could not be ascertained. The
cause of the fire is not known.

, Dr. Peixotto will lecture on con
temporary-socialism and the history
of socialism, in which he will review
the methods of contemporary social
istic parties and examine the antece
dents " of contemporary socialism. The
instruction in the department will in
clude, finally, lectures on agriculture
by Professor Ehvood Mead of the irri
gation department, on the commerce
of China and Japan by Professor John
Fryer, on. the methods of modern
charities and corrections by Professor
ISrnest C. Moore and on insurance by
Albert \V. Whitney.
Assistant Professor "Wesley C.
Mitchell will offer a new course in
"International Exchanges," in which
he will consider foreign bills, prices,
international trades, foreign invest
ments and shipments. Professor
Mitchell will also assist Professor
Aliller in the course on the principles
of economics, and repeat his lectures
on banking v money, the labor prob
lem and econom'c origins.
Dr. Simon Litman, instructor in
commercial practice, will offer two
new courses, one touching upon busi
ness forms and practice and the other
upon customs tariffs and regulations.
His other courses will be discussions
of modern industrial processes, the
technique of trade and transporta
tion.
The department has been greatl>
strengthened by, the addition of Pro
fessor Henry Rand Hatileld and Pro
fessor Jessica . B. Peixotto to the
teaching staff. Professor Hatfield's
courses will deal 1 with commercial
geography, the geography of interna
tional trade, the history of commerce,
practical banking, the principles of
accounting and the investment mar
ket.. Professor 'Hatfleld is "an au
thority, on thp subject of commercial
accounting and was lately called from
the University of Chicago to accept
the post of associate professor of ac
counting. ' '.:';Â¦;:
BERKELEY, Aug. 10. â In response
to the rapidly increasing enrollment
in the college of commerce of the Uni
versity of California the work of the
department of economics has been
completely reorganized for the next
term. Announcement was made to
day of many new courses in economics
with direct and practical application
to the needs of modern industrial life.
These courses will be of great inter
est, however, not only to students who
are fitting themselves for banking, in
surance, commerce, manufacturing
and exploitation of natural resources,
but also to the theoretical student.
Professor Carl C. Plehn, dean of
the college of commerce, will offer
during the year a new course in the
"History and : Theory of Prices," in
which he will discuss the methods of
scientific investigation applicable to a
study of prices and the causes of their
fluctuations. In addition he will give
courses in American agriculture, the
economics of industry, public finance,
statistics and railway transportation.
The course which he gave last year
in the history of economic science will
this year be given by Professor
Adolph C. Miller, who has arranged
that Professor Plehn shall take his
course in railway transportation.
The work in economics will be
completed by the highly important
courses to be given by the head of
the department, Professor Miller of
the chair of political economy and
commerce. Besides the course in the
history of economics he will offer a
new elementary course in the intro
duction of economics and will repeat
his old courses in the principles of
economics, the financial history of the
United States, and advanced econom
ics.

child a certificate to this effect, and other
, prtupipal* in the Oakland School Department
Â¦will accept such certificate as natififaciory evi
dtnee of successful vaccination.
â¢ OAKLAND, Aug. 10. â Superintend
ent J. W. McClymonds of the School
Department said to-day that before
the week closes the schools will have
received more than their quota of pu
pils. The Superintendent explained
that the vacant seats are rapidly fill
ing and that the setback to enroll
ment because of the vaccination order
appears to be only temporary. Partial
reports from the schools to-day show
that normal conditions have been
reached and that there will be over
crowding in some of the buildings.
In connection with the vaccination
order City Attorney McElroy has giv
en an opinion, at the request of Su
perintendent McClymonds, that prin
cipals of schools may determine by
personal examination whether the ap
plicant for enrollment has been vac
cinated. Following is an order that
was issued to-day by the Superintend

The campaign for the bond issue for
Oakland improvements has begun,
though the City Council has not yet
formally called the election. In com
mittee session the Council has de
cided that the bond election shall be
held September 27 and at the meeting
on Monday next this action will be
regularly taken. All of the other pre
liminary work has been done and
there now remains nothing 1 but a cam
paign of a little more than six weeks
in which to impress upon the voters
of Oakland the necessity for the pro
posed improvements.
A regular campaign will be under
taken by the city officials of Oakland
and the various improvement societies
and organizations interested in the ad
vancement of the city. All of such
societies will hold meetings before
the bond election, at which members
of the City Council and city officials
will be requested to explain the pro
posed bond issue and the reasons for
its adoption.
The first general meeting for the
central portion of Oakland will be
held August 16 under the auspices of
the Oakland Board of Trade. This
will be the regular quarterly meeting
of the board and they will resolve it
into a bond meeting. The officers of
all the local improvement societies
have been Invited to be present and
the plan is to start a series of meet
ings in all sections of the city and to
carry on an active campaign that will
induce every voter in the city to cast
his ballot September 27.
The first actual meeting in favor of
bonds was held last night in the
Union-street Presbyterian Church.
The meeting was called by the Men's
League of that church for a discus
sion of the matter, but there was very
little discussion, for the members
seemed to all be of one mind and that
for the bonds. Addresses were made
by George W. Dornin, president of the
Oakland City Council, *and Edwin
Meese, "chairman of the Street Com
mittee of that body. Dornin showed
that if all the bonds were voted it
would add $3 25 in taxes to each
thousand dollars' worth of property
in Oakland for the first year and that
this would be reduced as the bonds
were paid off and property values
rose. He believed that the increased
valuation of Oakland property caused
by the investment of the bond money
would meet, to a large extent, the in
crease of actual taxes. January 1
next Dornin said that the bonded in
debtedness of Oakland would only be.
$252,500. This would leave an avail
able bond credit of $5,000,000, which
could be raised for a water plant if
the people thought best.
Dornin explained that every item
in the bond issue was separate and
could be so voted for or against except
a few small parks, which were
grouped. The items in the bond is
sue are:

The j*ry failed to take this view of
the case. Robinson says he put the
money in a bureau drawer when he
went out one night and found on re
turning that his room had been ran
sacked by thieves and the money
stolen. He refused to make the loss
good, and suit was brought against the
company, his surety, for the amount.
The plea that Robinson was not re
sponsible was held not to be a good de
fense, because bondsmen are for pro
tection* against loss without reference
to the manner in which the loss may be
occasioned. '
By a verdict rendered to-day the Fi
delity Deposit and Trust Company of
Maryland is held responsible for the
sum of- $269 22 lost by W. H. Robinson,
former treasurer of Athens Camp No.
457, Woodmen of the World, and must
pay this amount to the camp, as well
as costs, amounting to $17 in the Jus
tice's Court, and 82 in the Superior
Court. The money, it was claimed by
Robinson, was stolen from his room,
and the surety company made the de
fense that it could not be held respon
sible for ikmething not the result of
the act of Robinson.

cratic party will have undisputed con
trol of the convention of that party.
The Democratic vote was so small,
however, that a very few votes would
have swung the party control either
way. In the Forty-ninth Assembly
District there were only 55 votes cast
for both Democratic county tickets
and only 47 votes for both Democratic
Slate tickets. The Laymance-English
ticket won the county fight by a vote
of 35 to 20 and they won the State
fight by a vote of 30 to 17.
There has been no discussion about
Democratic nominees, the fight being
solely for control of the party ma

John Mitchell won his light for the
Republican nomination Tor Supervisor,
but there is going to be no friction in ,
the Republican party as a result of that
victory if he and his friends can help t
it. The battle was a stubborn one and
hard fought in every precinct. Leaders
were arrayed against leaders on each
side, and there was bitterness in some
sections, but simply because two Re
publicans came together in a hard
fought primary is not considered to be
any reason why the fight should be con
tinued. As a result ol this feeling there
were several little private conferences
last night and to-day. Several of the
-victorious leaders talked with several
of the defeated leaders, with the result
that the wounds of battle are rapidly
healing, and by the time the Presiden
tial election is here the party will bo
more united in Alameda County than
it has been for many years.
These conferences were informal, and
personal rather than official, but they
all tended to harmony in the future.
Those who talked matters over were
Guy C. Earl, Charles E. Snook, Charles
H. Spear and A. H. Breed of the Mitch
ell forces, and County Clerk J. f. Cook,
his chief deputy George Pierce, J. Cal
Ewing and a number of others repre
senting the Randolph forces. Both sides
expressed conciliatory sentiments. The
Mitchell managers frankly said that '
they wanted the Randolph men to get
behind the ticket and expressed a de
sire to give the defeated side full recog
nition in the convention and in the fu
ture. The Randolph men met them in
the same spirit. As there are no county
officers to be nominated this year ex
cept three Supervisors, and the county
convention when a county ticket is to
be put up is still two years away, it is
likely that the hatchet will be buried.
rcturns canvassed.
The canvass of the returns of yes
terday's primary election was begun
by the Supervisors to-day.* It is a
complicated and tedious task, owing
to the multiplicity of parties and the
contesting tickets within each party.
Only the Forty-ninth Assembly Dis
trict and the portions of the Fiftieth
and Fifty-second districts comprised
in the Fifth Supervisorial District
were canvassed, these covering the
two Republican contests.
This canvass showed that John
Mitchell carried the entire Fifth Su
pervisorial District by a majority of
120, including the Fiftieth Assembly
District and West Oakland. In the
Fiftieth Assembly District, where the
hardest fight was, he had a majority
of 102, while in the Forty-ninth As
sembly District he had a majority of
30. There were two precincts of the
Fifty-second Assembly District in his
Supervisorial district, of which he lost
Golden Gate by 64 votes and carried
Feralta by 20.
The vote for Assemblyman In the
Forty-ninth District was about as
close as it could well be, there being
a difference of just three votes in the
total in that district. ; Those three
votes were in favor of Morris Flynn,
but as the Assembly district was di
vided into election precincts, J. J.
Burke carr>d a majority of the dele
gates and will get the nomination.
This peculiar condition was caused by
the fact that Flynn carried only one
precinct in his district, his home pre
cinct, but he carried that by a
phenomenal vote, and Burke carried
a majority of the voting precincts,
each, by a small majority. This ma
jority was so small in one precinct, a
portion of the Fourth Ward, that
Flynn elected one delegate out of the
eight apportioned to that place,
Burke elected six, while three dele
gates were tied for the eighth vote.
This will give Burke 21 1-3 delegates
and Flynn 10 2-3 delegates in the en
tire district.

In the early twenties he came to

with Oakland, Berkeley and Alameda.
There is no doubt that the man was
nearly 120 years of age.

The climax was reached. Cheers re

ST. LOUIS, Aug. 10. â In the con
vention of the International Typo

the proposition that no member of the
International Typographical Union
shall enlist in the service of any State
in the United States as State guard,
militiaman or ranger, under the pen
alty of expulsion and being barred
from reinstatement. On this proposi
tion the committee on laws had re
ported As sentiment
against this unfavorable report arose
in the convention Delegate Anderson
of Macon, Ga., chairman of the com
mittee on laws, jumped to his feet.
When in a patriotic address he quoted
the famous lines of Sir Walter Scott:
Breathes ti^ere a man with sou! so dead
Who never to himself hath said:

Union Men .Toinins Militia.

Butchers' Union President Arrested.
SIOUX CITY, Iowa, Aug. 10. â
Charles Macguire, president of the
Butchers' Union and leader of the
packing house strike in Sioux City,
was arrested to-day on a charge * of
conspiracy to injure the business of
the Cudahy Packing Company.
The Pinkertons disappointed Mc-
Nab. He expected better service from
the detective agency than was given on
election day. The leader of the County
Committee forces has no thought of
compromise in dealing with his politi
cal adversaries. He asserts that the
regulars will organize the convention,
and that the Horses and Carts will not
have a look-in. He claims that the or
ganization has elected 100 of the 163
delegates.
The leaders of the regular Republi
can, organization are quite well sat
isfied with the result of the primary
election. According to the official can
vass Richard J. "Welch Is elected to the
State convention in the Thirty-second
District. Robert Gordon is elected to
the local convention. Welch headed
the opposition State ticket and Gordon
the opposition local in the district. The
organization elected all other delegates
In the Thirty-second.
rOOR DETECTIVE SERVICE.
The opulent, easy going deputies
were hugging the sweet delusion that
peace reigned In the party and no more
assessments would be required for a
year, when whizz, bang, came the fight
from the league, and every fellow hold
ing a good job at the City Hall had
to dig down for money to print pasters,
hire watchers and organize for re
sistance.
Regret Is expressed in the corral of
the Horses and Carts that some enter
prising repeater did not vote the name
of that distinguished but absent Demo
cratic statesman, James D. Phelan.
The Fays were voted at the sweet will
of the stuffer.
Gavin McNab has put on his war
paint. He asserts that steps have al
ready been taken by the Merchants'
Association to punish the men who
perpetrated frauds on election day, and
predicts that some of the offenders will
be sent to the penitentiary for fraudu
lent Voting.
The Call's statement yesterday morn
ing that McXab had won ninety-six and
O'Brien seventy-two of the 16S dele
gates to the local Democratic conven
tion is correct. There is nothing but hot
air in the claim that the Horses and
Carts will organize the convention.
James H. O'Brien claims delegates In
the Thirty-ninth and Fortieth districts
who were vigorously opposed on ele<>
tion day by Horse and Cart forces.
O'Brien was asked yesterday to name
two or three delegates in these dis
tricts who would go into the Demo
cratic League caucus, but declined to
give names on the ground that it would
expose the delegates to pressure from
the County Committee. The facts are
that O'Brien's following: In the conven
tion will not exceed sixty-eight and he
may encounter a, deal of trouble in
holding that number In line. The poli
ticians, however, agree that he put up
a good fight and compelled the Demo
cratic machine office holders and
attaches to hustle around and produce
the 'sinews of war.
DEPUTIES HAD TO DIG.
The Board of Election Commissioners
yesterday commenced the official count
of the returns In Tuesday's primary
elections and will conclude Its labors
to-day. Previous to beginning the
count the board canvassed the returns
from the 109th precinct in the Forty
fourth Assembly District, which had
not been Included in the results. The
regular Democratic ticket polled forty
one votes and the Democratic League
twenty-seven, making a total in the
district of 2S3 for McNab's ticket and
241 for the Horses and Carts.
Pierre Mairie Erneste Waldeck-
Kousseau was born at Nantes, France,
December 2, 1846, and was a son of
Rene Waldeck-Rousseau, at that time
a prominent member of the Assembly.
Waldeck-Rousseau studied at St.
Lazare, where he practiced for spme
time before settling at Rennes. There
he made his first entrance into poli
tics, being elected Deputy in 1879. He
then became prominent in the ranks
of the Republican Union, which was
very conspicuous in opening the way
for innovation an/1 the present Re
publicanism, and was considered one
of the most prominent orators of the
Assembly. His best known work was
for the reform of the judiciary.
He was re-elected on August 21.
1881, and on Xovember 14 of the same
year, although only 33 years old, was
admitted into Gambetta's Cabinet aa
Minister of the Interior. The short
lived Ministry of Gambetta did not
ofter a fitting chance to Waldeck-
Rousseau to prove his ability at that
time. The resignation of the Govern
ment took place on January 6, 1S82.
Having been offered the same port
folio in the succeeding Cabinet, .he ac
cepted and held it until 1885. In 18S6
he was elected a Senator. In 1888 he
v/as entered at the bar of Paris and
has since then pleaded some of the
most important cases of the time.
On June 22, 1899, Waldeck-Rous
seau was called upon to form his own
Ministry and after having been in of
fice for over three years he resigned
on June 1, 1902. Shortly after his
resignation as Prime Minister, havfng
b^en repeatedly taken ill with trouble
of the stomach â cancer, according to
some versions â Waldeck-Rousseau re
tired from public life.

SEATLE. Wash., Aug. 10. â Cor
nelius l!cL. Stoneman. a son. of former
tlovernor Stoneman of California, shot
" himself through the braiii r this morn
iv.S and died almost instantly. The
.Utath was a premeditated suicide, for
before firing the fatal shot the de
, spondent man addressed two letters
"To the Press," giving in a rambling
w'ay the cause of his suicide.
Stoneman was about 42 years old
' and hafl been employed by the Seattle
Cereal Company as engineer for the
: last two years. He held an engineer's
license issued by the city, which will
expire next December. tJtoneman was
..a single man and for several months
had been rooming at 61S Fifth avenue.
"Man's love and woman's perfidy" Is
cnÂ» reason that he gives for his self
."tj^ 5 * 1 " 1 * 01 * 011 - Â¦ Another is that he
'imagined himself to be a,-/obber and
"that temptations were beir.g put in
his "way every day in the hope that
lie would do something that would
: cause his arrest.
' Those who knew Stoneman best Bay
.that they believe his mind had be
f'come deranged. Others believe that
.lie has had trouble with women and
this le.d to his hurried end. All these
things he refers to in letters found in
liis pockets.
*At the odee of the Seattle Cereal
Company it was said to-day that
Ftonernan had not missed a day's
"vork'fince he was first employed by
the'- company two years ago. There
c h<Â» is paid to have been honest in all
Jiis dealings. Why he should imagine
j J hat- he was being watched as a thief
Is a mystery to the company, for it
â¢ had" always regarded him aa entirely
. trustworthy and competent.

PARIS, Aug. 10.â Conul General Gow
dy on arriving at the American consu
late to-day found that his private desk
had been forced, the woodwork badly
smashed, petty cash and postage
stamps amounting to several hundred
francs abstracted and his papers ran
sacked. The big safe of the! consulate
bore suspicious traces of unsuccessful
attempts to force It open. The safe con
tained a large sum in cash and im
portant documents.
The consulate occupies a handsome
suite of rooms on the" third floor of 36
Avenue de l'Opera, one of the finest
streets in Paris. The building is de
voted to offices, nobody except the Jan
itor residing there.
The burglars gave their attention to
Gowdy's private office, in which are a
large desk and a strong safe. The
former was partly wrecked, the draw
ers being forced, the woodwork splin
tered, the papers turned out and let
ters even being dragged out of their en
velopes. Luckily none of the drawers
contained anything valuable, beyond
a few hundred francs, the petty cash
and postage stamps, which were car
ried off.
The safe, which the robbers failed to
open, contained about $5000, besides im
portant documents.
The union officials are elated over
the conditions as they now exist. The
contest has been and will be one with
out bloodshed. They point to the fact,
which has been verified, that over 60
per cent of the men who have gone
into Zt-igler have quit, and from those
who have come out they learn that not
a man, unless it be the' guards, will re
main longer than is necessary to get a
stake. The conditions are so absolutely
different to those of any other Ameri
can plant that the American miners
will not remain. To-night another con
tingent will be landed.
CARBOXDALE. 111., Aug. 10.â
Shortly after 5 o'clock this morning in
a car of the 'Wheeling and Erie Rail
road, Joseph Letter, armed with a
Colt's revolver, personally conducted a
contingent of thirty-nine West Vir
ginia coal miners to his plant at Zeig
!er. The coming of %he train was
known to the union miners at Plnck
neyville and Duquoin, but after keep
ing up a vigil until nearly 3 o'clock in
the morning the men gave up the task,
thinking the report was untrue.
On the train Leiter talked freely and
mingled with the men. He was in
buoyant spirits. Up to date the sum
total of the large contingent from
West Virginia which he has publicly
proclaimed would man his shaft is
sixty, and many of the men who first
went in have quit. They refuse to
work where they are not permitted to
make a garden or own domestic ani
mals, or where they are not permitted
to own more than their household
goods.

One of the men lost his grop, contain
ing $15S in cash, and a German who
had been in this country only a short
time lost $4000 worth of bonds and
mortgages and other valuable papers
when their baggage was thrown into
the river by the strikers yesterday.
In speaking of conditions at the
Schwarzchild & Sulzberger plant, the
men claimed the sleeping-rooms were
so filthy that many of them went out
of doors at night and lay on the bare
ground. â¢ ' --
According to their statement of the

Kansas City.
KANSAS CITY, Aug. 10.â Saying that
they could not stand the sanitary con
ditions at the Schwarzchild & Sulz
berger packing plant and alleging that
the officers of the company had broken
faith with them regarding wages, forty
one men picked up by Murray &
Ready, the Schwarzchild & Sulzberger
agents at San Francisco, walked out of
the plant of that company this morn
ing, notwithstanding the efforts of the
boss to prevent them, and joined the
ranks of, the strikers. It was the bag
gage of these men that was destroyed
by a gang of strikers - yesterday, and
every man in the party says he will not

Premier Combes decided to post
pone his departure from Paris and the
Cabinet will meet to-morrow to con
sider the details of the funeral, which
the Government desires shall be of a
national character.
"I have received the news contained
In your telegram with the keenest
grief. Please explain to Mme. 'Wal
deck-Rousseau the share I take in her
mourning, which is the mourning of
all France."
A priest was summoned from Paris
to administer the last rites to the Min
ister, but he was too late.
When the death of the Premier be
came known messages of condolence
began to arrive. The first came from
Premier Combes, who telegraphed:
PARIS. Aug. 10. â Former Premier
Waldeck-Rousseau died at 2:45 o'clock
this afterrlon at his country residence
at Corbeil, eighteen miles from Paris,
from the effects of an operation,
which his medical attendants deemed
to be affinal necessity. A similar
operation, performed in" Paris some
months ago, proved partially success
ful and the former Premier was well
enoug-h to be removed to Corbeil,
where it was hoped that rest and the*
effect of the country air would re
store his strength. The evil, however,
was not eradicated and alarming re
ports regarding the condition of the
distinguished patient had been cir
culated frequently.
When Waldeck-Rousseau was in
formed of the necessity of another
operation, he received the news witn
calmness and courage. The operation
was performed at noon to>-day by Pro
fessor Kehr, who was assisted by Dr.
Armor and three French surgeons. It
at first appeared that it would prove
successful and the patient was re
moved from the operating table to
bed, but the pulse became more feeble,
and, despite the administration of in
jections of serum, the patient grad
ually sank and died without regaining
consciousness.

were obliged to carry him to the patrol

CHICAGO. Aug. 10.â James O'Leary,
the "king" of hand-book men, was to
day acquitted by Judge Clifford. On
the motion of Attorney Edward Morris,
in whose hands O'Leary intrusted his
case, Judge Clifford instructed the jury
to return a vedict of "riot guilty."
The court ruled out the evidence of
the 100 telegrams addressed to O'Leary
and giving the odds on the horse races
at New Orleans, Sheepshead Bay and
other racetracks. The court held that
no proof was furnished that any of
these messages reached O'Leary's
hands or were intended expressly for
him.

Tennis Prodigy to Be Seen ln Action
at San itafacl After Eastern
Triumph.
The tournament committee in
charge of the coast championship
tennis tournaments to be played at
San Rafael next month received word
yesterday that the Sutton sisters will
defend their titles. It has been gen
erally understood that the Southern
California champions would be absent
this year. The presence of these
famous sisters will add to the interest
in the coming tournament.
Miss May Sutton. the national
champion, is singles, doubles and
mixed doubles champion of the coast.
She shares these honors with her sis
ter, Miss Violet, and with A. C. Way.
The champion will be the chief at
traction at San Rafael. Her triumph
ant tour of the East, which has just
ended, has brought her more honors
than have fallen to the lot of any
athlete from the West. She won the
national championship with the
greatest of ease, and proved beyond
a doubt that no woman tennis player
in America is entitled to rank in her
class.
Alfonzo Bell, the crack player from
Los Angeles, who holds the coast
championship title, is In the East, and
it has not been learned yet whether
he will get back in time to defend hia
title.
Reuben Hunt, the Alameda crack,
who won the Northwestern champion
ship from "Waidner during the week,
will play at San Rafael.

ing Even His Friends.
Yesterday vras a happy day at the
Munroe training quarters, for the bii?
miner looked better and worked faster
than at any other time since he h;n
commenced training for his battlo
with Jeffries. While boxing with Andy
Gallagher and Harry Chester JacJc
landed blow after blow with both
hands and showed foot work that as
tonished even hia most ardent ad
mirers.
He seems in perfect condition at thÂ»Â»
present time, having lost that rotund
appearance. When he hit the punch
ing bag yesterday he put nil kinds c:f
life and snap into his work ind went
at it with a will. After boxing five of
the fastest kind of rounds with Ches
ter and Gallagher the big fellow was
treated to his rubdown.
Jeffries is not losing any time at
Harbin Springs. He goes through hia
usual stunts and makes it interesting
for Joe Kennedy and Brother Jack,
his two sparring partners.
The Yosemite Club officials have se
lected Eddie Graney as referee and no
one else will be considered.

â¢hits were culled from the stock of
Jimmy "Whalen, but these same nine
' brought in six runs. Score, Seattle 6,
Baa Francisco 2.
Never for a moment did the home
â¢ tossers have a chance to lay claim to
the game after the second inning. Jay
Hughes toyed with them, kidded them
and then mystified them. He was
"steady and cool all the time and simply
had the locals bewildered, especially
when men were on bases.
Seattle started with one in the first
and it might have been more had not
Delehanty hit into a double play. The
natives came back with two in the
third when Van Buren lut and Town
'send sacrificed and Irwin soused one to
left. Anderson swung through with a
: double to left and a moment later a
eteai and Wilson's error made it two.
This gave Uncle, some confidence, but
it was short lived, for the Siwashes
comnienced in the fourth to break it
VP for fair. Mohler hit and Frisk
walked. Blankenship unloaded one in
front of Meany and as Pat was about
â¢ to wing it in to the ijlate the ball took
a bad bound and went to the fence for
k triple, scoring both men. Blanken
fhip arrived on Smith's out, making it
throe for the inning and four in all.
Mohler drew a four spot in the sixth,
but only had to wait a few seconds for
Frisk to drive one to the score board
and brinj him to the pan. Smith kept
the good work up and Frisk came in
with the last. one.
Waldron was called out by O'Connell
in the third r *>n an infield play and im
mediately (commenced to abuse the
umpire. J/tick stood for the tirade for
a moment and then ordered Waldron
out of game. He did not feel in
clined/ to obey, but went Â©ut into the
lTt'jd .Vith his team mates. Jack finally
persuaded him to take to the dressing
room, but not before the irate fielder
Â°had emitted a lot more back talk. The

ALLEJO. Aug. 10.â A fairly good at
tendance of spectators witnessed the
first day's racing of the Vallejo-meet
of the California circuit to-day. The
track was fast, although a strong wind
was blowing. A field of seven horses
started in the first race, the 2.15 pace.
Edwin S, the favorite, won ln three
straight heats. The fastest heat was
done in 2:12%.
In the race for green pacers a field
of eight started. All the heats were
good. Dr. W won, being closely pressed
by Cavalier.
The principal event of the day for the
local people was the race for Solano
County road horses, which brought out
a field of four. After considerable scor
ing the trotters were sent off, and it
was soon seen that the race was be
tween Princess \V and Roscoe. The
first heat was won by Roscoe. Princess
W then took the race by winning three
straight heats.
The bookmakers did a good business.
The favorites won the three events on
the card. Summary:

CHICAGO, Aug. 10.â C. R. Ellison's
great mud horse Judge Himes made a
show of a good, field in the mile handi
cap to-day at Harlem track. Old
"Giraffe" found the track with a soft
cushion, which favored his "dinky"
legs. After Gregor K and Warte Nicht
had raced their heads off in front he
ran over them in the stretch and won
in a canter, with three lengths to spare.
Warte Nicht finished second, a like dis
tance in front of Gregor K.
The backers of Gregor K were dis
pleased at the showing of Hedges' geld
ing. He was nearly pounded off the
boards, opening at 9 to 5 and backed
down to 13 to 10, while Judge Himes
went from 2 to 1 to 3 to 1 at post time.
Warte Nicht also had a strong follow
ing, which backed him from 4 to 1 to 18
to 5.
Three favorites, one second choice
and three outsiders well njbbled at won
purses. The track was slow, but drying
out rapidly, there being no mud in
sight. The weather was cloudy and
threatening and the attendance about
as usual. Summary:

SARATOGA, N. Y., Aug. 10.â Over a
dead, damp track, made so by rain
which fell for several hours this morn-
Ing, the Grand Union Hotel stakes, the
chief feature of this afternoon's sport,
was decided. It is a guaranteed event,
with $8500 to the first horse. There
were seven starters, with the Paget
stabl^a strong favorite at 11 to 10. The
race was -a surprise, as it was won by
J. E. Madden's Siglight, which was
called a Cheap selling plater by his
owner recently. The finish was close,
many to the left of the judges* stand
thinking John "W. Schorr's Jack Lory
had won, but those in line with the
finishing point declared that Siglight
won by a neck.
He ran a remarkable race, as he was
forced back to next to the last place on
the far turn. The pace was set by Glen
Echo and Sparkling Star. In the last
furlong there was a general closing up
from the rear, and Siglight, Jack Lory
and Cairngorm became the three lead
ers. Cairngorm nearly fell at the last
furlong pole. The other two fought it
out and" Siglight won by a neck, with
Jack Lory a small margin Ln front of
Cairngorm. Summary.

The Supervisors' Street Committee
had its attention called yesterday by
Supervisor Rock to the fact that the
Board of Works- was paying $12 per
day as rental for street sweeping' ma
chines. Rock thought the machines
should be bought outright. Herbert
Sthmitz of the Board of Works stated
the machines cost $1200, but the
board was investigating the suction
machines used in Los Angeles and
other methods of street sweeping and
the machines may be dispensed with.
He promised to report on the matter
in two weeks.
Action on the complaint of Mrs.
Mary Drady that her property had
been damaged through blasting opera

agreeing: to select persons competent
to appraise the damages.
The petition of citizens calling at
tention to the violations of the ordi
nance requiring safety devices on side
walk elevators was referred to the
Merchants' Association for investiga
tion as to suitable devices, so the ordi
nance may be revised and enforced.
Sixteen property-owners yesterday
filed a protest against the acceptance
of the bitumen used for the new pave

Twenty-fourth and Twenty-sixth, on
the ground that it is too soft and was

mittee postponed action on the ac
ceptance of the blocks until after a
hearing.

The recent discovery of placer gold
;on the beach at Sand Point has added
'to the troubles of. the skippers c-f the
vessels of the cod-flshing f.eet. The
schooner Pearl arrived yesterday, 14
Â¦ dayfc from Sand Point, and Captain
â¢Sod<yholm reports a large number of
desertions from all vessels touching at
the Alaska fishing port. The Pearl lost
Borne erf her men and ihat they did not
.ail go, says the skipper, is due more
Â¦ to his vigilance than to the sailors'
. sense of duty.
All available claims have been
Â¦staked out, but the owners fire offer
ing J10 to J12 a day for men to work
them and the bait is too tempting for
most- sailors to resist. The diggings
-have proved rich and' the ground is
easily worked.

Chester Donaldson. United States
Consul at Managua, has been a guest
at the Occidental Hotel for two days.
He is enjoying a leave of absence from
his southern post. Regarding the con
ditions in Nicaragua, Consul Donaldson
says the Central American republic has
never before enjoyed the prosperity she
is now experiencing. Peace has appar
ently been permanently established
throughout the republic, and this fact
has given encouragement to foreigners
to invest much capital in industrial
projects there.
It is the opinion of the Consul that
the building of the canal through Pan
ama instead of through Nicaragua,
while a great disappointment to the
people of the latter country, will not
greatly affect Nicaragua, whose citizens
have turned their attention to the de
velopment of their own territory and
are rapidly forgetting that they ever
hoped for a canal. In view of the fact
that the canal route through Nicaragua
has been abandoned, Consul Donaldson
thinks that the United States will soon
make a number of changes in its con
sular service In that country.
Several years ago, when it was hoped
by this Government that Nicaragua
might have the canal, the authorities at
Washington established a consulate at
Bluefields and placed in its charge the
entire consular business on the Atlan
tic side of the republic. Donaldson was
then put in charge of , the business orig
inating on the Pacific side. It is now
expected that in the near future the
United States Government's entire
Nicaraguan consular service will be su
'pervised from the capital of the coun
try. At present the United States Min
ister 'accredited to Nicaragua has his
headquarters at San Jose, Costa Rica.
Consul Donaldson has been a resident
of Nicaragua for nine years and has
held his present position for five.
The Board of Harbor Commissioners I
yesterday opened bids for the construe- j
tion of a car ferry slip in China Basin. ]
The Santa Fe Railway Company was
the only bidder and won the contract. \
The corporation offers to construct the \
slip for $30,000 and- take a lease on the
property for seventy-two months. At
the expiration of this time the property
will revert to the State. A- suitable |
bond accompanied the bid, which was
accepted without opposition.
President Spear called attention to
the fact that tl:e work on the new stair
way in the ferry building is not accord
ing to specifications. The Imitation
Tennessee marble being used is thicker
than called for in the plans and is also
off color. Spear said the contractor had
told him that in the course of years
the imitation marble would fade to the
desired color and it was impossible to
make it any thinner. He offered to
give up the contract, for a bonus of $700.
This offer was not accepted and the
matter was turned over to the board's
engineer for investigation.
Giovanetti & Son, commission mer
chants, asked that the permit to do
business on the State wharves, which
was revoked last week, be renewed. In
their communication the firm says that
it has withdrawn from the Produce
Dealers' Association and is willing to
abide by the spirit and letter of the
Woodward act and the regulations of
the Harbor Commissioners. , A new
permit was, by motion of Commissioner
Kirkpatrick, granted the firm.
Attention was called by President
Spear to the injunction Issued by Judge
Kerrigan on application of Webster &
Dunbar, G. B. Olcese. Jonas Erlanger-
Davis Company and Schultz, Hansen &â¢
Co. temporarily restraining the board
from interfering with the business of
these firms on the wharves. The mat
ter was. referred to the attorney for the
board without comment.
A communication from the Southern
Pacific Company asking that the board
I arrange for the dredging of Channel
! street to a depth of twenty feet from
! Fourth street to deep water in the bay
; was referred to the chief engineer.
i The board adjourned until next

SEQUENCEâ A. P. P., Alameda. Cal.
In poker a sequence is five cards, not
of the same suit but all in sequence.
In computing the value of a sequence
an ace counts either as the highest or
the lowest cardâ that is, below a deuce
or above a king. When each party
holds a sequence the hand commencing
with the highest card in sequence wins:
so, also, when two or more parties hold
flushes against each other. If there is
a tie the next highest card In either
or any hand wins. ,
The Superior Court, in a decision^ recently rendered,
draws a fine distinction between "office" and "employ
ment" as applied/ to the leisurely occupation of the serv
ants of the municipality. While there may be to the
legal mind some similarity between the terms, if not an
identity, to the lay mind public office and employment
are as far removed from each other as the poles. Their
association would be an absurdity. :
LETTERSâ A Reader, City. There
is a law In California that makes it a
crime for a person to open a letter ad

struction of that law a husband would
not have the right to open his wife'a
letters, but if the old idea that a man
and his wife are one prevails, he prob
ably would have the right to open such.

"5 HENRIETTA STREET. COVENT

how Mr. Pinero likes Jt? Wonder if he
isn't a bit jealous of Mr. Barrie? This
year's season, Jike last year's, starts
with new plays coming from both dra
matists, and once more, the elder play
wright seems in danger of being
eclipsed by the younger. In spite of
Mr. Barrie'p string of successes â "The
Little Minister," "Quality Street" and
"The Admirable Crichton" â probably up
to last fall no one thought of his wrest
ing from Pinero his title of premier
British dramatist. Pinero least of all.
But "Letty" and "Little Mary," pro
duced within a few nights of each oth
er, afforded a rather striking compari
son so far as popularity was concerned.
The Pinero play Interested the town

REPORTS from London announce that at last Col
onel Younghusband's "commercial mission" of
regular Indian troops has arrived at the gates of
the Forbidden City of Lhasa. After having dragged their
gatlings and their howitzers over the summit of the Him
alayas and used them to good effect more than once on
the barren steppes of Tibet, these missionaries of a
commercial creed are now at their destination. The
world awaits the results of their preachment.
That the anxiety of some interested nations as well
as the doubts at home might be set at rest there' were
recently read, before Parliament all of the official pa
pers bearing upon the Tibetan mission. These, coupled
with the assurances solemnly pronounced to Russia, and
more recently to the United States, at least define the
position Great Britain has taken in the Tibetan affair if
they do not allay unrest in the suspicious hearts ' of
some.of her near neighbors on the Continent. ,
"A trade mart shall be established at Yatung, on the
Tibetan side of the frontier, and shall "be opened to all
British subjects for. the purposes of trade from the first
day of May, 1894. , The Government of India shall be
free to send officers, to reside at Yatung to watch the
conditions of British trade at that mart."

Americans for two years it seems time for anybody's
patience to be worn out. It might be well for the Sultan
to view Secretary Hay's words as a- threatening prelim
inary to actions that do not ask but force respect.

No Chinese representative of the

their ideas of anatomy and physiology
are matters of faith â confirmed by im
ages which have been reproduced dur

teaches that the skull is formed of one
bone; so is the pelvis; the number of
ribs varies with the individual, and at
the junction of the arm with the fore
arm is placed a cubital patella. Ac
cording to Chinese splanchnology the
small intestine communicates with the
cavity of the heart, while the colon,
after describing sixteen circumvolu
tions, terminates by opening into the
lung. The heart governs the vital pro
cessesâIn co-operation with the cavity
of the stomach It supplies all ideas and
all pleasurable sensations. The liver is
the habitat of the soul, and it is from
this gland that all noble and generous
sentiments emanate.
The gall bladder is the receptacle of
courage, its ascent in the body is the
cause of a fit of anger. They have an
idea of the continuous motion of the
blood, but it seems to be the, product
of an imagination more riotously Ori
ental than even that which created the
other items of their physiology knowl
edge. They do not know the pulmonary
circulation; they naturally know noth
ing of the valves In the veins; they do
not even appear to have quite grasped

5 HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT
GARDEN, LONDON. July 27.â Before
long, marksmen in some part of the
' United States may find themselves op
posed on the shooting range by an at-
Ctractive English girl in the person of
Miss Florence Lewes. She is the young
woman whose exploits with her rifle
at this years "Bisley," the annual
British shooting competition, have at
tracted so much attention. MissJ^ewes,
who is a grandnieoe_ of Geor^P^Henry
Lewes, George Eliot's friend, explained
the other day. just after she had made
S3 out of a possible 35 bullseyes, at 200
yards, that she took up shooting not
long ago because she intends to emi
grate to Canada shortly. So her ap
pearance on American ranges is an
event quite likely to occur.
Women rif.e shots are rare in this
country. One of them turns up at Bis
ley now and then, but for the most
part their personal appearance is
rather weird, and they don't really
know how to shoot. Miss Lewes, on the
contrary, is quite the trimmest figure
ever seen at the Bisley range, and her
marksmanship made many of the male
â¢'cracks" green with envy. Tall and
Cood-ldoking, she shot in a brown cos
" tume, belted at the waist, her jacket
' being fitted with yellow elbow patches.
She also wore a very effective white
helmet, with an "anti -sunstroke" flap
behind, and high brown shooting boots.
When at work. Miss Lewes is busi
nesslike to the last detail. Sitting
down on the range, the other day. she
. prepared her rifle in the orthodox fash
ion, without any help. A glance at the
â¢ flags told her how much to allow for
wind, and then from her satchel she
.produced a "vernier" and small pencil,
with which she carefully drew the
aiming line on the back sight bar. Her
subsequent work with the rifle showed
that she possessed both the steady
nerve and the clear eye of the born
ehot. Vpon her first attempt at Bisley
she rofssed the center ring of the tar
get only three times and in each case
the shot was the closest possible "in
ner." She shoots also at &00 and 600
yards, where his scores vary from 22
to 28 out of a possible 35.
It is only two mor.ths ago that Mies
Lewes first went in for marksmanship,
. on learning that she was to go to Can
â¢ ada in August. "I expect to lead a de
lightful life there." she said, "but I
know that it is necessary to J>e a good
. horsewoman and to know h\y to use
the rifle." So Miss Lewes placed her
self under the tuition of Private Gray,
the famous instructor of the London
Scottish regiment, and for the last two
months ha? shot regularly at the
â¢ weekly matches. So far, the young
woman's silver trophies number nine.
THE city of Riverside has, through the work of a
committee and with the sanction of the local
Chamber of Commerce, with painstaking care and
with much of detail, prepared for beautifying the. city
streets with trees upon a definite S}-6tem. Riverside is
already famed for attractiveness. In the winter its dwell
ers represent all civilized portions of the globe. Tour
ists go there in great numbers. The charms of skillfully
placed semi-tropical foliage are effectively employed to
give architectural beauties fitting environment. Attention
to the task of making the city beautiful has paid finan
cially. A golden harvest has been reaped and other aurif
erous tourist seasons are in view. Persons with wealth
and refinement appreciate that which pleases the eye all
the more when it is coupled with city comforts. The
shrewd people of the south see this and are acting ac
cordingly.
In any line of endeavor a wise system counts. Â» To
produce the best results the best system is indispensable.
The Riverside committee is evidently in complete har
mony with this view. The Riverside Enterprise pub
lishes the committee motto, as follows: "If a man write
a better book, preach a better sermon or make a better
mousetrap than his neighbors, though he build his house
in the woods, the world will make a beaten path to his
door." Nothing is left to individual caprice in the River
side plan in the selection of the variety or the number
of trees to be planted in the streets. So many cotton
woods arc to be in one locality, a determined number of
pepper trees, eucalypti, Hame trees, magnolia trees Â»or
other determined varieties in other specified localities.
Uniformity in a locality is secured. The result will be the
best that Riverside can do and the world^as heretofore,
"will make a beaten path" to its door.
The value, of information of this sort is found in its
application. Riverside is but one of several communities
in Southern California continually striving to be con
sidered more attractive and more desirable than any rival
as a place of residence. Riverside, already well adorned,
adopts system that it may not only be beautiful, but that
it may become pre-eminently so, as much so as possible.
It is the idea of the party versed in entertainment as
compared with that of a mere amateur who underesti
mates the desires, ability and intelligence of th'-se to be
entertained. Therefore the work proposed is entitled to
respectful consideration. <
The climate and soil of the cities north of Tehachapi
endow them with prolific growths, but there is not one of
these communities that has done its best to become a
show city. Alameda is beautiful with its wealth of shade
trees and large residential sites. Oakland has fine streets
and avenues. Berkeley vaunts its contours and views of
bay and ocean. Marin County is a miniature Switzerland.
The counties north and south of San Francisco are beau
tiful with orchards. and. vineyards. But no one will ven
ture to seriously combat the assertion that no Northern
California community has yet even resolved to do its
best to be beautiful. System and determination are all
that are lacking. Money abounds. An Italian sky is
overhead. What town or city will tear a leaf from the
Riverside book and systematically plan to become the
best possible show town north 'of Tehachapi?
BEAUTIFYING BY SYSTEM.
For native impudence, unsurpassed even in the riots
of imagination, the invitation of the Japanese besiegers
of Port Arthur to the Russians to surrender and save
the useless cost of thousands of human lives, must be
accepted as the limit in modern experience. The little
brown men should be able after this to take a unique
place in history as a nation of unconscious jokers. They
must remember, however, that in war the balance of
profit and loss. is not made in human lives.
After many years the hordes under
Mohammed II captured Constantin
ople. At that time the crescent- wa3
used everywhere and upon everything.
Suspecting that there must be magi
cal power in the emblem the Moham
medans appropriated it and have since
used it as their only symbolic decora
tion. â Boston Transcript.
The crescent symbol of the Moham
medans haa nothing to do with their
peculiar religious opinions and cere
monies. It was not originally a sym
bol of the followers of Mohammed at
all. but was first used by the Byzan
tines. Thousands of coins have been
found in all parts of Turkey which
date back to the time when Constan
tinople waa known as Byzantium, and
on each of these the symbol of thÂ«
crescent appear*, proving conclusive
ly that it waa in use as an emblem,
among the people of that region long
before Byzantium was overthrown
and its name changed to Constantin
ople. The story of the origin of tho
crescent symbol lg as follows: When
Philip of Macedonia besieged Byzan
tium he had planned to storm the city
on a certain cloudy night, but before
his arrangements were completed the
moon shone out and discovered hi?
approach to the besieged citizens, who
accordingly marched out and repulsed
his forces â something which would
have been impossible in the darkness.
After that event all Byzantine coins
bore the symbol of the crescent moon,
which was always alluded to as the
"savior of Byzantium."

If there were ever a time in the history of the coun
try when the public interests require honesty and frank
ness in^the men who seek the suffrage of the people,
that time is now. The moneyed combinations that have
excited the fear of the people are behind Judge Parker.
Western men of finance visiting New York are taken into
the vaults of the great financial institutions and shown
the sheaves of bonds and securities that represent hun
dreds of millions, and are told that if President Roosevelt
is elected those securities will be made worthless. No art
of persuasion or coercion is left unused to foster the idea
that the President will bring financial ruin upon the
country. What does it all mean?
Obviously the President represents the popular wish
that all persons, natural and artificial, shall obey the law
and be subject to it, while the great combines desire a
free hand 4o do-as they please. The country has been
taught by the vigor of the President's action that he will
enforce the law and make it unsafe to indulge in illegal
aggressions upon the rights of the people. Before this
all other issues and all party names and all party alle
giance fade away. On the part of the President are sin
cerity, frankness and courage. With his opponents there
io daily action and sign that the Presidency is to be cap
tured, if possible, by covertness and deceit. If money
can buy it it will be bought for Judge^ Parker. If the
public interests have the sense of self-protection the peo
ple will carry the day for Roosevelt.
THE ways of -latter day Democracy are mysterious
and past finding out In New York the favorite for
the gubernatorial nomination is Mr. Dan Lamont,
vice president of the Northern Pacific, and one of the. ac
tive parties to the railroad merger, which the Federal
Supreme Court knocked out, in the suit brought at the
instance of President Roosevelt. In Minnesota the
party's strongest candidate for the Governorship is Mr.
J. J. Hill, president of the Great Northern and the author
of the same railroad merger, which he and Mr. J. P.
Morgan effected.
The Republican Governor of Minnesota, Mr. Van Zant.
organized the seven States that were stricken in their
interests by the merger to resist it by the application of
State laws. Mr. Hill has untold millions at his com
mand, as has Mr. Lamont, and they would both spend
liberally to secure a popular indorsement of the railroad
trust, and rebuke, at the same time, President Roose
velt and Governor Van Zant. All of these plans are laid
and hopes entertained by the party that has been making
anti-trust agitation a prominent factor in politics.
Whether Lamont and^Hill are nominated or not, the
movement for them is indicative of their friendship
and support of Judge Parker. It remains to be - seen
whether the people will indorse the trust idea by falling
in behind its exponents. No matter in recent years pro
duced such widespread feeling as the combination in one
trust, one management and one policy of three com
peting roads, the Burlington, Northern Pacific and Great
Northern. The prompt action of the President in en
forcing the law saved the transportation interests of a
vast population and an enormous productive area. Will
the people rebuke him for it? That remains to be seen.
The muddling of the muddle is further assisted by Mr.
Eliot Danforth, who appears with a statement affirming
that President Rooseveit is a very dangerous man. a
usurper, who may ruin the country any morning before
breakfast. In the same article Mr. Danforth lauds the
honor and the safety of Judge Parker, and files a bill
of particulars. In this he says that when Parker was
nominated for Chief Judge in 1897 the Gold Democrats
of New York started a movement to formally indorse
him. Thereupon Mr. Parker announced to his friends
that his honor would not permit him to accept such
indorsement without making his position on the money
question known, and that he would prepare, a letter dis
closing the fact that he was a supporter of Mr. Bryan's
views, and voted for him in 1806! If the Gold Demo
crats, informed of this, chose then to indorse him, his
honor would permit him to accept it!
Mr. Danforth puts this out as evidence of the sensitive
nature of the Judge's honor. But what happened to that
quality of the Judge since 1897? Following the dictates
of honor as he saw them in 1897, he should have sent
his gold standard telegram to the St. Louis con
vention before his nomination and not after. Is
there one kind of honor at stake in a nomination for
Chief Judge and another in a nomination for the Presi
dency? Mr. Danforth has succeeded in proving that in
1896 Judge Parker was for free silver and against sound
money and the gold standard. That he held the same
position in 1900 there is no doubt. Just when did the
scales fall from his eye?, and at what spot on the road
from Esopus to Wolfert's Roost, causing him to see the
true faith about money? Why did he retain all the joy
of his conversion in his own hreast until after he was
nominated and the convention could not back out? This
money muddle is a fit companion piece to the trust mud
dle which takes into the sympathy and activities of the
party the red-handed trust leaders of the country.
Now. although It haa been ahnounoed

Is to be seen here nrst and afterward

idea for the play was Barrie's. Rumor

daughter. And no sooner had the dra
matist confided It to his manager,
Charles Frohmian, than the American
Impresario declared that Ellen Terry
must be secured for the' part of the eld
er woman, so off he and" Barrie posted

MUDDLING A MUDDLE.
and China has been 'the fly in the ointment for
the Indian Government. The Tibetans first re
fused to comply with, the agreement, in that they
deliberately took all trade from Yatiing, leaving
that village nothing but a spot on the map as far as
commercial value was concerned. Then came the news
that Russia had concluded a secret treaty direct with
the Tibetan Dalai Llama by which she was to have the
cream of the trade from that drear country of snow
In January of last year the Indian Government noti
fied the British Secretary for India at home: "We can
undertake negotiations nowhere else than at Lhasa," and
"a British commercial mission will start for that place
at a suitable date in the forthcoming spring, there to
meet the Chinese Resident and a duly appointed high
official of the Tibetan Government. We think that the
negotiations should culminate in the appointment of a
permanent British representative, consular or diplo
matic, to reside at Lhasa."
This, then, is, in brief, the British justification of the
Younghusband expedition. Now that the troops of the
Indian Government have had to fight their way from
the frontier righ^up to the gates of Lhasa itself, shed
ding much Tibetan blood in the operation, it is plainly
a larger question than the establishment of a consular
representative in the Forbidden City that the leader of
this mission has to face. For the first time in the his
tory of that strange land an army of white soldiers has
faced the walls of its sacred city. Can it be reasonably
expected that with these invade.rt there .will be executed
a mere treaty of trade relation I?
The power of circumstances to alter cases will prob
ably receive convincing demonstration before Colonel
Younghusband begins the homeward trek.

of outrage?
Hundreds of acts equally infamous are
repeated from day to day, daring strikes
conducted by lawless and criminal mem

Decent . people read with horror the
tales of distress, women attacked and
sometimes stripped on the street, (St.
Louis St: car strike), workmen blown to
pieces with dynamite, men assaulted,
mobs formed, millions of doilars worth of
property destroyed, many lives lost, and
a general reign of terror, disorder, and
anarchy conducted by the labor trust, in
trying to 'dree the balance of mankind to
obey, without question the mandates of
the leaders of the Unions.

They favor no law but their own, end

pure and simple.

broke the rales of the union and went to

They caught him one evening on the
street, knocked him down with brass

To-day we inaugurate a sale of hosiery that will be a memorable event in
the annals of San Francisco's retail trade. No bargain of the kind has ever been
offered, and this sole has been made possible by the simple fact* that* we made a
lucky purchase from one of the largest* and best* known manufacturers. We
cleaned up all of his samples and the remainder of his season's stock at* less than
the cost* of manufacturing. They are all good things and it* would therefore be
advisable to call early.

Late Shipping Intelligence.
SEATTLE, Aug. 10.â The hull of the
Nome steamship Discovery is lying on
the Inner side of Middleton Island, near
Valde*. Advices to that effect were re
ceived in Seattle to-day.
On a recent cruise in northern waters
the steam tender Pacific of the Alaska
Packers' Association cruised close to
Middleton Island and there saw the hull
of the Discovery. The officers reported
at Valdez that the hull is high above
the ordinary water line and was no
doubt landed there in a heavy storm.
When the steamship Discovery went
down between "twenty-five and forty
persons met death, the exact number
aboard the vessel at the time not be
ing known by the local representatives
of the company. The vessel made her
last call at Takutat, en route from
Nome, about the middle of November,
1903.
The board of engineers held a brief
meeting in the Flood building yester
day morning. C. W. Clarke, who owns
sixteen ranches on the Sacramento
River; A. S. Peiley. who owns a por
tion of Sherman Island, and H. Park,
a rancher of Tulare, gave a concise
history of the damage that has been
done by floods within the time of their
memory. They had no suggestions to
offer as to a remedy, being confident
that the engineers appointed for that
purpose were better fitted to cope with
the difficulty than they.
The board will hold meetings each
morning at 10 o'clock until they leave
on their tour. These meetings will be
informal, however, It being the opinion
of the board that It is best to avoid a
general discussion of the condition un
til after the ground has been gone
over.

CHICAGO. Aug. 10. â Scare news from the
Northwest continued . to be a factor in the
wheat market, but appeared to impart less
terror to the hearts of wheat traders. There
wan no panic, no sharp break, no reversal ot
advices, but apparently a general disposition
to await more conclusive information of .North
west conditions. In the uncertainty manifest
ed at the opening, September wheat scored a
loss of %c to ftc, initial sales ranging from
$1 Cl% to $1 01 %. Timid longs who had not
taken advantags of the high prices of the past
few days saw much of â¢ danger in the new
sentiment, and seized -the opportunity to un
load, causing prices to descend to a lower
level, , September going to $1 00% under the
celling pressure. Professional buying rallied
the market on the break, the purchasers' con
fidence being attributed to a rumor that the
Government report would show an - enormous
decrease from last year's figures/Under this
leadership longs gained new courage and for
a time the furious buying spirit of the past
few days seemed to have revived.- September
responded with a bulge to $1 02 before the
fever abated. There was plenty of wheat to
be had at that figure. In consequence a grad
ual recession ensued to $1 00%, or under
the opening price. Shorts and others alert 'to
buy at the lower figures steadied the market
and carried the ' price back to $1 01 for Sep
tember, at which figure lt closed.
Corn values held up well, but with a gen
eral inclination to weakness. September bulged

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ Liverpool futures were lower and
Paris futures higher.
Chicago was lower than on the preceding
day,' as will be seen. The Government Issued
its monthly report, showing a spring Wheat
condition August 1 of 87.5, against 93.7 July
1 77.1 August 1 last year and a ten-year
average for August 1 of 81; It said that it
was yet too early to estimate the damage from
rust. The report Indicates a winter Wheat
crop of 333,400,000 bushels and a eprlng Wheat
crop of 247,000,000. Total crop, 5SO,O0O,00O,
which Is not as low an estimate as the other
recognized authorities, but it must not be for
gotten that these figures were made up before
the current reports of rust damage were re
ceived.
Cutter A Moseley's wires from Chicago said:
"Marketings of long Wheat are enormous and
well taken There is no question about the
extensive damage in the Northwest, but the
crowd are Inclined to realize because the Gov
ernment report will not show lt."
The wires of E. F, Hutton & Co. said: "Crop
reports continue bad, if not worse than ever,
with the Northwest heavy sellers. Dallas
i (Tex.) wires that even at the advance the mlll
;â¢ era are not - able to get enough Wheat, The
crop Is shorter than anticipated and no doubt
a great quantity will be chipped Into that State
1 to meet the demand of the milln."
The wires of R. Brent Mitchell said: "It
was a nervous. . uncertain market on a moder
: ate volume of ' trade, mainly scalping opera
: tlons. The cables leaned . toward weakness;
there was further crop damage reports in the
Northwest of same character as heretofore.
; Along with these, however. Is coming rather
less sensational estimates and some modifica
tion is noticeable in the general character of
the news from that quarter. The large prottt
Â¦ taking In this market by leading holders is
1 also felt to some extent. A little more atten
tion Is; being paid to the cash situation as
outside movement of Wheat continues liberal
and millers are rather disposed to hold â¢ off.
As a matter of fact the flour situation seems
such that the Wheat is worth more for specu
lative purposes than fors. marketing it Into
I flour The Government report this afternoon,
' while it may : show considerable' decrease - in
the condition, is not expected to reflect v tha

Mail advices from New York say of crop pros
pects: "The present outlook for the 1904 coast
crop Is 2C0.0CO bales. Oregon being estimated
at 100,000 bales, California 60,000 bales and j
Washington 40, COO bales; others of the trade,
however consider these figures excessive and
look for a crop of about 1S0.C00 bales. Ad
vices received from up the State continued fa
vorable and most of the trade look for a State
crop fully 25 per cent larger than last year.
Cable advices were received from England
giving rather better prospects for the crop,
which promises to yield from 400.000 to 420.000
cwt. The market for 1903 Hops held firm,
with a limited demand from brewers."
Of Wool a local firm says: "Spring shear

NEW YORK, Aug. 10.â Speculation in
etocks was largely devoted to what are
known as the specialties to-day. The con
stant whipping up of excitement and activity
in one or another of these afforded the principal
sustaining inrtuence on the general list. That
this influence was not notably effective is
disclosed by the Ijtt of changes for the day,
which were comparatively insignificant.
'ihÂ« waiting attitude ot the market was un
doubtedly due .ta the desire to read the
monthly report of tne Agricultural Depart
ment on the August 1 condition of the gram
crops, and especially of spring wneat, before
venturing on extensive commitments in stocks.
The Incidental speculation in the specialties
was apparently designed as a diversion for
what promised to be a dull period for the
time, lor publication of the crop report being
4 o'clock, there would be no chance for oper
at:r~ In to-day's market on the basis ot its
lniormaticn. Ine grain markets also reflected
the importance att-ched to the Government
report in the nervousness exblhlted for specu
lators committed in that market and their de
eire to lighten their contracts before the report
ehould appear. The realizing which carried
back the prices of wheat was largely attrib
uted, to this purpose, although the weather
in the spring wheat country was considered
better. Stocks derived some firmness from
this view. There was a continued belief in
the difficulty experienced In the Eteel trade
over the maintenance of association prices, as
was ehown by the persistence with which
United States Steel preferred hung below last
night's price, in face of the firmness of other
stocks. Good advances were made by South
western Railroad Btocks, which were fairly
attributable to the comparative prosperity of
the cotton and corn crops, as compared with
wheat. The rise in Southern PaciUc was im
pressive to sentiment, because accepted as
showing the protective policy toward the mar
ket of its controllers. The conviction became
firmer that gold would be exported to Eng
land this week, as sterling exchange continued
to advance, acd the London market rallied on
tfce same assurance. But the real Interest
of the day centered in the furious specula
tion in the fpecialties. The sensational ad
vance In the Metropolitan stocks was accom
panied by much published quotations from In
fluential but unnamed individuals, who were
Impressive in their admissions that important
transactions were Impending, but entirely reti
cent as to specific information of what the de
velopments would be. The day's movements Jn
Sugar and Amalgamated Copper were equally
mystifying as to their basi*. These advances
were not fully held at the close and the whole
market underwent some reaction, but the clos
ing was active and firm.
Bonds were firm. Total sales (par value),
$2,960,00-0.
United States bonds were unchanged on calL

Hay and Feedstuffs. â¢
The millers continue to ''report steady to
firm markets for Bran and Middlings.
Somers & Co. in their circular say of Hay:
"Shipments of Hay have been on the in
crease again, the total arrivals for the .week
â¢Just ended amounting to 470O tons, or COO tons
more than for the week preceding. We note a (Â¦
somewhat better demand than last week, but
In spite of this fact Hay Is being shipped here
rather more freely than the situation war
rants All grades of Hay are therefore drag-
King, except perhapa strictly gilt-edge Wheat j
Hay, There is yet an exceedingly large
amount of Hay out of doors that must be
marketed before the rains, and toward the end
of the month we fear rather an unprecedented j
rush of Hay to market. Conditions this year
have been quite the reverse from those of last
season; last June the market ' opened with
fairly good figures and made a slow but steady
advance throughout the fall and winter. This
year the reverse of this seems to be the case,
for, although the market opened quite firm,
yet ever since the middle of June there has
been a steady weakening in the situation, with
a continually oversupplled market.
5 "Aside from the disinclination on the part
of many consumers to buy their season's sup
ply at present prices, we note a decided de
crease in the natural demand. On careful In
vestigation we find that there are large num
bers of horses turned out to pasture at present,
which materially lessens the consumption of
Hay here."

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
The Potato market was more active, particu
larly for cheap stock In sacks, which was In
fair request for shipment to various points
in the Southwest, but supplies were well up
to requirements and prices showed no improve
ment. Sweet Potatoes from Coachella were
selling slowly at 5c per pound, while Merced
lots met with prompt sale at 3%c. The de
mand for Onions showed some improvement
and top quality stock was slightly higher.
Receipts of Tomatoes continued light and
freshly arrived lots cleaned up quickly at im
proved prices. Bay Tomatoes are commencing
to come forward freely, but they are selling
slowly as the trad<> is running almost entirely
on the' river article. Green Corn was firmer j
for fresh stock, but there was still plenty ot
carried-over in. sacks to be had at easy figures.
Available supplies of Garlic were held by a
few dealers who were exacting higher prices.
Okra and Lima Beans were plentiful and
easier, while the other vegetables stood as

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Yesterday was a dull day in this trade, as
the retail grocers were out of town on their
annual picnic and the wholesalers had nothing
to do except to loaf about with their hands in
their pockets. The Butter and Egg markets
were both strong, however, with stocks of
choice goods well cleaned up. Some dealers
quoted Eggs a little higher, but most of the
trade found no change.
Some of the Butter houses are complaining
of the action of other firms In drawing large
lines of Eastern out of the Icehouse, cutting,
It up into squares and putting It on the mar
ket as choice California creamery. They say
that this is hurting the sale of California
creamery, as at present quotations it can be
sold In this guise below the California goods
and at a very large profit. .

SPLENDID BUILDING ERECTED FOR THE LITTLE SISTFRS OF THE POOR AS f
HOME FOR THE AGED. WHICH WAS FORMALLY DEDICATFn wctpr
I>AY BY ARCHBISHOP MONTGOMERY. AND AN INTERIOR VI E^V YESTER-
The report of the City Chemist, filed
yesterday with the Board of Health,
shows that the spraying apparatus in
stalled by the Sanitary Reduction
Works results In the elimination of all
the noxious gases emanating from the
burning of the garbage in the crema
tory and as a consequence the odor
from the smoke is not any more offen
sive than that from common house
smoke. Investigations disclosed that
there were 2000 pounds of mud precipi
tated by the apparatus during ten
hours' run and analyses showed that
the noxious gases such as sulphuretted
and carburetted hydrogen were retain
ed in the water instead of passing off
in the smoke. : : . Â¦;. .. r ,,Â»
Acting on the report of the City
Chemist, Health Officer Ragan and
Chief Inspecting Physician Hasa
ler signed a letter to the corporation
testifying that the spraying apparatus
was adequate for the purpose intended.
Hassler reported that the dairy of
W E Allen, at Forty-sixth avenue and
P street, which had been under quar
antine, owing to unsanitary conditions,
had been closed, Allen having disposed
of his cattle to Dominick Roberts. As
a commentary on the kind of water
used by Allen in adulterating his milk,
Hassler reports that Allen's horse,
which showed evidence of poisoning.
Â¦was killed and a post mortem examin
ation disclosed that the animal's stom
ach was filled with one gallon of sand,
several pieces of tin, a few nails and
some wood fiber. The well used by Al
len has 'been filled.
The Board of Health yesterday is
sued its "Health Hints for House
holds," over which it and the Super
visors had some trouble regarding the
printing of the names of the health cf
flcials on the front page. Although the
Supervisors' Health Committee
thought the printing of the names
would be too much of an advertise
ment for the medicos, the names of all
the members of the board and that of
Health Officer Ragan appear on the
cover It was intended to have Mayor
Schmitz's name printed, but the Health
Committee successfully opposed that
nlan Deputy Health Officer Levy,
?rom whom copies of the Pamphlet
may. be obtained, succeeded in having
his name put on the pamphlet, al
though the committee ruled against it.
The proposed visit of Health Officer
Ragan and Chief Physician Hassler to
Santa Clara County to Inspect the
dairits. on Information given by Health
Officer Simpson of San Jose that some
of them are unsanitary, was postponed
until next Saturday. v :

No telephone message was sent from
the Morgue to Mrs. Jackson. It is be
lieved that the message came from
Cavanaugh himself, though with what
motive it is difficult to understand. â¢
Deputy Meehan explained that no
one named Cavanaugh had been re
ceived at tho Morgue. Brown, how
ever, viewed the body of one Wilson, a
suicide, and said that although he had
not seen Cavanaugh for several years
he was almost sure that that waa
Cavanaugh"? body.
It appears that Wilson was well
known where he died and that he could
not by any possibility be the missing
Cavanaugh. Immediately after Brown
reported that Wilson's body was that
of Cavanaugh his mother sent a cable
gram to Cavanaugh's mother in Aus
tralia announcing his death. Later in
the day another friend of Mrs. Jack
son viewed the remains of Wilson and
reported that Brown had made a mis
take.
Miss Elizabeth Jackson of 1714 Van
Xess avenue was summoned to the tele
phone yesterday morning, when she re
ceived the following message:
"Jim Cavanaugh killed himself last
night. He is now in the Morgue.'
'James Cavanaugh was well known
to the young woman and her mother,
Mrs. Elizabeth Jackson. He belonged
to a well-to-do family in Australia, was
graduated at an English university
and then became the black sheep of the
family. He was sent to this country
in the hope that removal from his old
associates might revive some slumber
ing spark of ambition within him, but
he went along in the old shiftless, aim
less, almost hopeless way. His mother
had been allowing him $50 per month
for his support, but a few evenings' ago
Mrs. Jackson received a letter from
her announcing that she had discon
tinued the allowance to her son.
Such is the story told to Deputy
Coroner Charles W. Meehan at the
Morgue yesterday afternoon by Mrs.
Jackson. Edward Brown, who was also
acquainted with Cavanaugh. came with
her to identify the remains.
MISTERY VEILS
DEATH NOTICE
Alfred Roncovieri, president of the
Board of -Education, was busy all day
yesterday preparing a proposed amend
ment to the charter providing that the
Board of Education be independent of
the Board of Supervisors in the prepa
ration of the annual budget of the ex
penditures of the School Department.
This amendment is on entirely different
lines to the one originally contemplated
by the Board of Education and which
provided for a special tax levy of 12
cents on every $100 of assesed valua
tion as the city's contribution to the
support of the schools.
The new amendment, if adopted* will
give the Board of Education the power
to prepare its own budget of the appro
priation which it considers necessary
for the actual maintenance of schools,
and this budget must be adopted by the
Supervisors.
Of course, in order to safeguard the
city against any extravagant demands
; which may be made for funds a clause
. will be inserted in the amendment lim
iting the tax rate to a certain figure
for the schools. The board has already
expressed Itself in favor of a 12-cent
rate, and it is likely that this will be
incorporated in the new amendment.
This would mean an appropriation of
$600,000 from the city, the State's por- |
tion being estimated at about $1,000,000 'Â¦
and increasing yearly as the number of <
pupils increases.
Roncovieri proposes to have the
amendment submitted to the voters by ;
petition of 15 per cent of the qualified
electors, and he has already received
assurances of support from many prin
cipals and teachers. The amendment ;
will first be submitted to competent j
attorneys to revise its legal phrase
ology.
"It seems to me," said Roncovieri,
"that the Board of Education is better
able to judge of its own needs than the j
Supervisors. Why, one of the members '
of the Finance Committee acknowl
edged to me that he was unaware that j
we had requested an appropriation for ;
the sanitary repairs in schools. If he
knew nothing about it, what did the
rest know about our requests? We ask
for so much, and they take a lump sum
off for no good reason. In New York
City they annually make provision for
25,000 new desks to keep pace with the
natural increase in attendance. They
are erecting fifty-five school buildings
there at the present time. In St. Louis
the Board of Education prepares its
own budget, being limited to a certain
tax rate, and the Board of Aldermen
must appropriate the amount asked for
providing it is in the legal limit."
Riordan asked for time to present the
defense, ard as he was to leave the
city last night for two weeks the case
was cc-ntinued till August 29.
The Judge, in denying the motion,
said that there had b<Â»en nothing to
show that Pen was not conducting a
legitimate business and it did not mat
ter who his patrons were. It had not
been shown that Pon had any connec
tion with the premises In the rear. The
evidence showed that Hutton had
given orders to arrest, without war
rant, every woman coming from 112.^
Dupont RtrceU and such order was
in direr-t violation of the injunction.
From the evidence before him a prima
facie rase had been made out.
Sergeant Brophy, Corporal Fraher
and Policemen Barry and Fennell tes
tified to receiving the order and the
two patrolmen to making the arrest of
Mary Duran in consequence of it. The
woman herself testified that she fre
quented Pon's restaurant and had just
eaten a meal when she was arrested
after leaving the restaurant.
Attorney Johnson mo-ved for a dis
missal of the citation, claiming that
the proceedings were farcical and that
there was r.o willful violation of the
injunction. He denounced Pon's resort
in unmeasured terms and contended
that Hutton was simply doing his duty
as a public official. Attorney George
D. Collins replied, contending that a
violation of the injunction had been
clearly proved against Hutton and it
was unnecessary to argue whether it
trcs willful or not.
â¢ Strenuous objections were made by
Attorneys T. D. Riordan and Hiram
Johnson on behalf of Hutton against
the introduction of the order on the
ground that it was a privileged com
munication, but the Judge overruled
them.
Police Commistkraer H. W. Hutton,
'Special Chief of Police for 1129 Du
pont Etreet," succeeded in getting one
of the charges of contempt of court
against him dismissed by Judge Cook
yesterday. On the second charge the
Judge held that a prlma facie case had
been made out by the prosecution and
Hutton was given till August 29 to pre
sent his side of the case.
The contempt consisted in the al
leged violation of the injunction
restraining the police frotm inter
fering with the business of Jean
Ton, proprietor of a restaurant at
112$ Dupont street. In the first case
Hutton waa charged with ordering
several policemen to raid the premises
in rear of the restaurant on May 21.
It was shown that three warrants of
arrest had been procured, designating
the women to be arrested, and the
Judge held that this was not a viola
tion of the injunction.
In the second case, Mary Z>uran was
arrested on the night of June 7 by Po
licemen Barry and Fennell after she
had left Pon's restaurant. Captain
Duke testified that he went to Hutton's
office on June 7, as Hutton had found
fault with him and the men under him
for not showing proper energy in re
gard to 1129 Dupont street. In accord
ance with Hutton's instructions, he is
sued an order to Sergeant Brophy and
Corporal Fraher to arrest every wom
an seen coming from 1129 Dupont
street, and immediately after the ar
rest the arresting officers were to tele
phone to S. L. Gummel, 603 Valencia
street, who would swear to the com
plaints and warrants, which would be
returned . as if the arrests had been
made on these warrants. The order
was produced in court.
