will be discovered. The brokers appear
to be "easy marks" on news from

Tbcre are two or three men in Wash

never, under any circumstances, can
be in^uc^d even to attempt to give or

themselves with sizing up things gen

of their suffering .and. opposition 'were

CHICAGO. June 2S.â Stung by what he
termed, his daughter's perfidy, William
Cleaver Wilkinson, professor of literature
and criticism at the University of Chi
cago and known the country over as the
author of a Chautauqua scries of text
books, his disowned Evelyn A. Wilkinson
because of her marriage to Nathan- W.
Stowell, a Los Angeles millionaire.' The
action was due to a romance which re
sulted in Stowell, who is fifty-three years
old, divorcing his conipaion of years and
marrying twenty-two-year-old; Evelyn.
â¢ In a letter to the attorney for the for
mer Mrs. ; Stowell, Professor Wilkinson
poured out his feelings in this manner:
"You,, cannot Imagine the depths of
darkness under . which .we are compelled
to live the remainder of our lives of sad
ness. We would infinitely' have preferred
laying her In â¢ the. grave. . ' If i wide, publi

though , nominally celebratlnp with, his
classmates tbs twenty-fifth anniversary
of the class of '80 of Harvard University.
President Roosevelt was to-day the .hon
ored guest of America's" most ancient
peat of learning- No degrees of honor
were conferred upon him. .as he already
holds the highest degree the university
is empowered to bestow, but the welcome
accrorded him by Cambridge citizens,
alr.rnni and college officials was most cor
dial.
The second point upon which I wish to speck
U the matter of sport. Now I ehall not be sus
pected of a tendency unduly to minimize the
importance of sport. I believe heartily in sport.
I believe In outdoor games, and I do not mind
In the least that they are rough games, or that
those who take part In them are occasionally
Injured. I ! nave , no Â« sympathy \u25a0 'whatever â¢' with
the overwrought sentimentality Â» which* would
Keep a young man in cotton wool, and I have a
hearty contempt for Mm If- he counts a broken
arm or collar bone as of serious consequence,
when balanced agalnÂ« the chance of showing
that he ' possesses hardihood. . physical address
and courage. But when- these Injuries aro ln
ficted by. others, either : wantonly or of aet'de
elgp. we are confronted by. the question, : not of
damage to -one man's body,- but of damage to
the other man's character. Brutality In play
lnÂ« a same should awaken . the heartiest and
most : plainly shown contempt for the player
KUlltyof it; veepedany If this, brutality is
coupled with a low cunning In committing It
without getting caught by the umpire. 1 hope
to BeÂ« both graduate and undergraduate opinion
come to. scorn such a man as one guilty of base
and dishonorable action, who has no place In
the fecard of gallant and upright men. -
- It Is a bad thing for any college man to grow
to regard oport as .the serious business of. ]if p.

the rest of us. most dolighi to honor,â -Colonel

Harvard Union.. than which no better gift; no
gift meeting a more vital need, could have been
given to the university. It' ls neither. poÂ«lhle

ences are compared to the differences of renl
achicveroest. and compared also to the bonds
which should unite, together all the men who
are In any degree capable or such real achieve

these capable men to their brethren who need
their help.

WORK OFFERS OWX REWARD.
As a people 1 think .we are waking: up to
the fact that there must be better pay for the
average man and average, woman t-ngaged In
the work of education. But 1 am not tpeak
inj? of this now; 1 am not speaking of the
desirability, great though that Is; uf giving
letter payment to the average educator: 1 am
speaking of the desirability^ of glvÂ»nÂ« .to the
exceptional man the chance of winning an ex
<*ptlonal prize. Just as he has the chance to
do in law- and business. In business- at ' the
present day nothing cculd â¢be more healthy
then an imraensc reduction in. the money. value
<>f the exceptional prize* thus to be won: bat
In scholarship what Is needed is the reverse.
'In this country we rightly bo upon the theory
that It I* more Important to care for the wel
lare of the average man than to put a pre
mium upon: the exertions of the .exceptional.
But we must not forget that the. establishment
of such a premium for the exceptional, though
of lees Importance, is nevertheless of very
great importance. It Is Lmuortant even to the.
development of the average man, for the aver
age of all of Ug la raised by the -work, of the"
Â£reat master?. . \u25a0 . '
BETTER PAY FOR SCIIOLYItS. ;
There Is no one thing which will bring about
this desired change, but there Is one thine
which will materially help in bringing it
about, and that is to secure to scholars- the
chance of getting one of a few brilliant posi
tions as prizes if they rise to the first rank
in their chosen career. Every Â«uch brilliant
position Ehould have aÂ» an accompaniment an
added salary, which shall help Indicate how
high thÂ« position really It; and it must be
the efforts of the alumni which can alone ser;,
cure Â«uch salaries for euch positions. <
then It will with difficulty be made attractive
to the most viÃorotis and Rifted of our Ameri
can young men. Good teachers, excellent In
stitution*, and libraries, are all' demanded-; in
a graduate 6CIIOOI worthy of the name, nut
there Is an even- more urgent demand for the
right sort of student. No flrst-cliss science.
no first-clacs literature or art.: tan â¢ ever be
built up with second-class men. The scho'l
firly career, the, career of the.man .xifJetteis.

be made such as to attract thosÂ« siroce .and

the Sebastopol squadron reach Odessa
it may be induced to join the mutineers.
Several members ot tne House ot Com
mons having business relations 'with
Russia were questioned in the lobby of
the House last night and admitted that
they regarded the situation with the
utmost concern. The majority, how
ever, inclined to the opinion that the
trouble was local and that it did not
necessarily show that the whole coun
try was ripe for revolution.
According to the correspondent of
the Standard, in a dispatch dated at 10
o'clock Wednesday night, the.quaran
tine station in the harbor, warehouses,
stores and offices and some ships have
been fired by revolutionary bands. All
foreign ships, the dispatch said, were
preparing to slip their moorings in case
of need, and. the Kniaz Potemkine was
playing a searchlight on every portion
of tho harbor. " V ; '
Late last night, perceiving a picket
of Cossacks stationed at the Richelieu
monument on Nicolai boulevard, the
Potemkine fired a shell, killing four
and wounding twenty of ; them.
"It is rumored," says this corre
spoadeat, - "but ; tbe rumor is not con
firmed, that 'the men "of four 'other
battleships, mutinied at Sebastopol,
and that tyro of; the ships are on the
way to Join the Potemkine. . .. > =
'"Two hours ago a huge mob broke
through the military cordon around the
town and looted two large customs
warehouses.
"To-night the Potemkine moved
closer to the breakwater, with^ her
guns still trained* on the- city. I All
public buildings ' are strongly ; guarded
and the night , patrols;^ have: been -in
creased by 6000 infantry and i 1200 Cos

of St. Petersburg, KiefT, War :

the cities of. dt. Petersburg and Moscow^
The mobollzation in St. Petersburg and
Moscow was begun at midnight. Many
of the reserve men who did not respond
were seized at their homes. All diy.
long men have* been inarched to bar
racks under .escort. The mobilization
includes Tsarskoa^Selo, Cachina, Peter
hof and other towns in St. Petersburg
province.-.; The workmen are grumbling
and'trouble is, expected,, but thus far no
rioting ;has occurred.: Sixty-thousand
men^ have been called to the colors.
Of this number about one-half will be
incorporated' into regiments. .
; //The; proposed mobilization 'in Russian

where orders have been* given to take in
from '\u25a0\u25a0 the reserve ' a sufficient number of
men to make up. the regular complements

ODESSA, Jnne^ 2S. â The red flag of
revolution is hoisted at the masthead of
the Kniaz Potemkine, Russia** most
powerful . battleship in the Black Sea,
which now lies in the harbor in the
hands of mutineers.
The captain and most of the officers
were murdered, aed their bodies thrown
overboard in the open sea and 4!:e ssliip

crew and a few oSiccrs who have
thrown in their lot with mutineers,.

The main squadron of the Black Sea
fleet, fonclktioK of the battleships
<icÂ«rgl l'ohiedocofcctx (Ucorse the Vic
torious), Tri SvlatUelia, Kostislav and
Kkntorina -11, vÂ»ltli two cruisers, are
expected to arrive here to-night, and a
regular naval battle is in prospect.
The rioters are in a most defiant
mood and are not inclined to surrender
\u25a0without fighting.
Reports of the mutiny, which oc
curred while the battleship was at sea,
are difficult to obtain, a*chc mutineers
refuse to allow communication with the
shore, but it is ascertained that it arose
Irom the shooting ot a sailor who was
presenting- on behalf of the crew a
complaint against bad food. According
to one version, this sailor, whose name
was Omiltchuk, objected to the quality
of the "borchtch," or soup, and was im
mediately shot down by a mess officer.
The crew then rose and seized the ship
and the officers, eight of whom were
spared- on condition that they would
join' the mutineers. The others were]
killed and their bodies thrown over- '
board. - c -
c After a period of vacillation the
Kniaz Potemkine headed for Odessa and
arrived here last night, accomapnied by
two torpedo-boats. Early to-day the
body 0 of Omiltchuk was brought ashore
in one of the battleship's boats and was
landed on the new mole, where it has
been exposed in semi-state ajl day. It
\u25a0was visited by thousands of persons.
many of whom placed coins in a basket
at the head of the body toward a fund
to defray the cost of the funeral, which
the sailors purpose, to hold to-morrow,
and which the strikers will make the
occasion for a great demonstration.
An Â° Inscription on the breast of the
dead Bailor states on behalf of the crew
f that Omiltchuk died for the truth, be
cause he presented a Just complaint of
the crew.
The authorities hare aiade no at
tempt to remove the body, the sailors
bavin? served notice that the ship
vronld open fire on any one seeking to
Interfere with it. A police agent visit
iuÃ the spot was killed by strikers.
During the day a red nag was hoisted
on the Kniaz Potemkine and members
of the crew rowed from ship to ship
isthe harbor, forcing the stoppage of
all work thereon. Food was supplied
by sympathisers on shore, who pillaged
the maritime storehouses.
The strike is now general in the city
and the rioters are growing: in numbers
and boldness. There were exchanges
of shots all day. but the number of vic
tims cannot be stated. This evening a
bomb was thrown In Cathedral Pal
ace, killing Its thrower and a. police
man.
, A telegram from the Mayor of
Odessa, who is at Moscow, imploring
the citizens to restore order, has been
posted throughout the city.
Daring the day one of the torpedo
boats which accompanied the Kniaz
Potemkine came into the' harbor and
seized the Russian steamship Esper

2000 tons of coal, which the battleship
Is taking on board.

an author. He has written a book that
pretends to portray the dark side of

written while Kirkman was under ar
rest in Fort Niobrara, charged with
enough lapses of good conduct to dismiss
a hundred officers.
As a West Point cadet In 1884 he be
gan his mad record, and be remained, in
the academy only after a verdict of dis
missal had been set aside. After his
graduation and commissioning as an of

martial and In each instance the sen
tence was dismissal. In the fifth only
did his influence fail to save him, and
last week he entered Fort Leavenworth
prison under a three-year sentence.
Under the title "Thirty Years of Army
Life" Kirkman is to tell all of the scan

Miss Rehan is improving and probably

resorting to "the knife.
LONDON, June 28.â Miss Ada Rehan,
the American actress, who is visiting
here, was taken 111 last Monday and the
trouble Is appendicitis. The symp
toms have not grown worsej however,
and the surgeons, who had made prepa
rations to perform the operation, at the
last moment decided not to do so.
ST. PETERSBURG, June 28.â At Great
Britain's door the Novoe Vremya lays
much of the responsibility of the Fran
oo-Gcrman crisis,; saying England 'is
pursuing her territorial policy of en
couraging a conflict between ; her com
petitors in order to profit thereby.
& "Great Britain," the paper adds,
"pushed France into the Morocco ad
venture, sustaining M.' Delcasse,' the
Foreign Minister, in his resistance to
Germany's claims: For decades Great
Britain's hostility has been directed
against Russia, at last succeeding- in
having another country accomplish a
task^ from which she herself 'shrank.
With Russia no longer dangerous for
the . present, all Great Britain's mach
inations were set in motion against
Germany, now. her : chief ( competitor in
Europe."
The Novoe Vremya thinks It quite
conceivable; that, \u25a0 in case of a conflict,
Great Britain would aid France to the
extent of .destroying, the German fleet
and that then, with both .France and
Germany . weakened, supremacy
would be assured for another half-cen
tury. The Novoe Vremya, however, be
lieves that, .with Premier Rouvier in
charge of the negotiations with France
Great Britain's -plans will be'defeated,
and the Moroccan affair will be satis
factorily adjusted.

County Democratic leaders are author

Lean, owner and publisher of the Cin
olnnntl Cnqnlrer, viill change the pol
icy of that paper noon and make it a
Republican paper. McLean's rcaiena

Ohio, sent in a telegram to Chairman
McKloaey at tbe Mate convention In

COLUMBUS. Ohio, June 2S.â After a
continuous session lasting six hours, with
â¢eeveral striking features, the Ohio Dem
ocratic convention to-day named the fol
lowing State ticket, to be voted on at the
State election in November:
For Governorâ John M. Pattison of
Clermont County.
For Lieutenant Governorâ Louis B.
Houck of Knox County.
For Supreme Judgeâ J. T. Mathers of
Stelby County.
For Attorney Generalâ James A. Rice
of Stark County.
For State Treasurerâ Charles F. Mason
of Butler County.
For member of the Board of Public
Worksâ Patrick C. Mcdovern of Muskin
gTim County.
The office of State Treasurer was the
only once for, which but one name was
presented for consideration,- eight con
testants lining up in the race for Gov
ernor and two ballots being necessary fer
both that place and for Supreme Judge.
After the temporary ofllcers were elect
ed as the permanent officials of the con
vention, Chairman Daugherty sprang a
sensation by reading a communication
"from National Committeeman John R.
McLean who wrote from Washington of
fering his resignation, which was at
once accepted.
Pattlson's nomination came on the
second ballot and had been predicted by
his managers in statements issued yes
terday and It was brought about not-
' withstanding the fact that the four
counties having the most delegates in the
convention were voting for other candi
dates.
In the way of demonstrations the great
est came at the close of Chairman
Daugherty's speech, when an impromptu
tribute to W. J. Bryan as the party
leader in the nation brought out a storm
Â©f cheers that lasted fully a minute and
was repeated later in the convention
when other speakers referred to the for
mer national candidate of the party.
The paltform adopted is as follows:
- The Democracy of Ohio, la convention assem
- bl^d, announces the following declaration of
principles:
We note- with satisfaction the determination
of the national administration to purchase sup
plies fcr the Panama Canal in the markets
of the world and not pay tribute to our pro
tectrd monopolies. We trust that the day may
soon come wh*n the common people of this
country may enjoy the same privilege and
not be compelled to pay the manufacturers for
the necessaries of life a higher price than
the articles are sold for by the same manu
facturers to foreign purchasers.
â¢ We. demand of our representatives In Con
gress to aid In the enactment of such laws
as will prevent all rebates and secret con
tracts by railways and will guarantee the same
service to every citlsen. , â¢
We favor the conferring upon the Interstate
i Commerce Commission the power, when it
finds a rate unreasonable, to fix a, reason
abi- rate.
Tbe Democratic party pledges Itself In this
State election. If successful, to use its utmost
endeavor to eliminate the graft and political
cormption that has been nourished and fast
ened upon the State by the Republican party
in the last few years. We have Been the
blighting effect of boss rule in one of our
cities and we call upon the voters, Irrespective
of party, to unite in preventing its perma
nent lodgment la control of our State.
We believe In free and unqualified home
rule. Free from State interference,! each city.
-town and village should be allowed to decide
for Itself all . matters of local policies, espe
cially as between public or private ownership
of all public utilities, including street railways,
am well aa water works and lighting systems,
and that provisoin should be made for sub
mitting such questions to the people upon
request from a reasonable number of voters
And at euch elections the majority shall de
cide, Such public ownership should be safe
guarded by the merit eyetem of appointment
and tenure of office, so as to prevent the
eprlnglng up of political machines and the
perpetuation of boss rule.
"Â»Ve declare that the present laws for as
sessing tbe property of steam railroads and
other public service corporations should be so
changed a* to compel the assessment of these
properties at net less than their salable value
and to prevent their evasion of just taxation.
We favor the election of United States Sena
ton by filrect vote of the people.
We favor the Initiative and referendum, es
pecially with reference to the tssulng of mu
nicipal and county bonds and the granting of
public franchises.
OBERLIN. 0., June 28.â James B. Dill
of New York, in the course of. an'ad
dress to thegraduating class of Oberlin
College, to-day delivered a scathing re
buke to men who misuse positions of
honor and trust for purposes of per
sonal gain. In urgrlns-Jiis hearers to
"go back to beginnings," Dill contended
that grafting, which was foreign to
the true American character, had been
developed by the mad rush for wealth
und the recognition of false standards
by educated men In the competitive
struggle for business power and social
prominence. Said he:
A large part of. our modern prosperity, is to
a perilously large extent bottomed upon an
overproduction of fraud and sham. The crisis
is acute. A feeline of distrust is growing
throughout the country. Many â¢ branches of
financial -business - have been in one way or
another taken' possession of by the unscrupu
lous for the purpose of deceiving the â¢unwary-
Trust companies have been- made the mediums
of the flotation of specious and fraudulent pro
motions. Some companies in the field of life
insurance, the highest and In a sense a sacred
form of investment, are, as we all know now,
conducted through a system by which the sav
ings of policy holders are diverted into specu
lative operations.
Credit Â«nd good faith, not money, are the
basis of business. Good or bad, our modern
prosperity Is founded on public confidence.
Take that away and the whole fabric falls.
. The fact Is that the unprecedented material
growth of the country, the resulting creation of
immense private fortunes, the massing of
great aggregations of corporate capital. Indus
trial commissions and railroad mergers, all
have tended to concentrate the attention of
the people upon great financial achievements
and to establish in the highest place In the
l>opular estimation the captains of industry
and the powerful financiers, little rfgard being
paid, in making up the Judgment, to the finan
cial virtues of private individual life.
Now, whose fault Is this? It Is ours. It Is
the fault of public opinion, and public opinion
is our opinion, yours and mme â yours of me,
mine of you. ours of all the rest. We have to
learn to recognize graft and the grafters,
however respectable their disguises, nad pun
ish them, not alone by imprisonment and fine,
but with al lthe might of the terrible scorn of
society. We have to recognize that the seeds
of socialism, revolution and anarchy are sown
by the man of our own class and kind who
pretends to be what hÂ« is not; these seeds are
cultivated by the grafting bank officer, insur
ance officer, man in power In financial organi
zationsâin ehort. every grafter who. in â¢ His
dealings, with the public, departs openly or se
cretly from old-fashioned ten-commandment
honesty. ' - '
This Indictment of our business life is j not
based upon an Inherent, Incurable defect In our
American character, but,' on the .contrary,
these evils are an outgrowth of our American
Mrenuoslty in the riotous race for the dollar
and the many dollars. In. the hearts of- the
genuine men and women of our country there
is an appreciation of the Importane of char
acter; the rank and file of the American people
not only believe In but also stand for tight
living and a conscience undlmmed and unfet
tered by business environments.
Therefore, right and honesty will triumph;
a saturnalia of graft and an era of grab will
find itself short-lived, speedily to be ended
by the uplifting Influence of educated men and
\u25a0women of character.
BERLIN,' June 28.â The calm tone the
French press has assumed since the re
ception of Chancellor ; yon | Bulow's an
swer has made an excellent -impression
on the German press, "since '; it coincides
wlth ; the view maintained i here through
out, that Morocco is not important
enough to furnish occasion for warlike
designs jon the part of two great powers
which otherwise . are | peaceably disposed.
PARIS; June 28.â The Franco-German
complications have been so far overcome
that a complete agreement is regarded
as only a question of time. The Im
provement in the situation was further
manifest in ofilcial and diplomatic quar
ters to-day and the bourse again showed
a marked advance in rentes and a gen
eral j firmness throughout.
It is; not likely that J France ; will send
another note, as her position was fully
defined in the first communication, .to
which Germany has fully replied. The
tone of these notes clearly Indicates
that the final understanding will be on
the basis of holding a conference.

disappointed If the offices - are kept
Bhut-on. Monday. On the other band,
It was argued that the conditions were
exceptionally favorable for giving to
the clerks and Dthers engaged In of
ficp work a fine outing, to begin on
Saturday night and continue until

and counted the responses sent by mail
to a .query regarding vne wishes of the
brokers., Ip appeared from this that
out of ' a membership of thirty-nine
large real estate concerns In this city
there were thirty -four in favor of clos
ing on Monday. Four houses only opÂ«
posed closing and one was non-commit
tal. This settled the matter at once in

Plant- lice .in great numbers are now
at work on the oak leaves. They. suck
the nap from the leaves, leaving a
secretion which develops into fungus,
eventually killing the leaves, after the
fashion of the black scale.
â¢ Besides this moth, the trcos are being
attacked by the Tussick moth and the
tent caterpillar. Their action is simi
lar to that of the first mentioned in
eect. "
BERKELEY, June moths
hover over the branches of the great oaks
on the university campus, their atten
tions being such as to lead Professor
C. M. Woodworth, the entomological ex
pert, to declare that the attacks of the
inserts constitute a menace to the life
of the magnificent trees.* Last year a
somewhat ; similar . plague was exper
ienced, but the visitations of the moths
this spring are very. much more harm
ful, in the opinion of experts.
Four varieties of insects have settled
in swarm upon the oaks. One of these
is said by Professor Woodworth to be
the only specimen of the kind in the
United States. This moth is called the
Phryganidia Californiea, of the dlop
tidne family. The moths hover over
the trees. In thousands. Their eggs are
laid on the brandies and leaves, to de
velop In a month into caterpillars. The
caterpillars 'eat the leavc| and twigs.
It is proposed by Professor Woodworth
to thoroughly spray thÂ« oaks when the
caterpillars are a few days old. hoping
by this, means to prevent serious dam
age.

SAN. MATEO. June 2S.â The greatest
improvement in the history of San ilateo,
the macademizifig of the streets through
out the business center, is now practically
complete and represents "both in the ex
penditure of money and in the display
of enterprise on the part of citizens, a
great step forward for the town. The
appearance of .the whole business district
has been changed by these new pave
ments and an agitation has been started
to continue the jwork to include the resi
dence sections of the city.
If this be done San Mateo will be one
of the most beautiful towns in Cali
fornia." The work has " been rushed to
completion in the expectation that fully
'ten- thousand visitors will be here dUr r
ing the celebration of Independence day.
The result > has been so gratifying that
Hie proposition to extend the improvement
to the rest of the town Is meeting with
marked enthusiasm. In connection with
this plan is an effort to induce the United
Railroads to extend Its service farther
south' in the city. Some time ago the
electric road people asked for a franchise
to extend their road in this direction, but
on a show of opposition the matter was

her trus.band, ' John E. Mathews. cruelly
rn.alfrea.ted" her yesterday at their home
in Jsan I>andro. Mrs. Mathews swore to
a/ .complaint to-day and caused her hus
bin'd/g arrest. . -
; The trouble, according to the mother,
et>rled. while the husband and wife were
disputing, over her purchase of a sewing
machine. "|p the "midst of the discussion
Mathews looked out of the window and
saw George, the eight-year-old son, tor
menting: his sifter. Angry over the quar
rel with his .wife, Mathews rushed out,
grabbed .the 'boy, 1 and, according to the
confplaint, ..began to beat him brutally
with a barrel stave. : .
* Alarmed lest the punishment should be
too severe, Mrs.- Mathews followed her
husbacd, and remonstrated with him.
His 'reply, was to turn upon his wife,
she declares, 'beat and choke her almost
into 'insensibility, and drag her into the
house. The wife asserts the was locked
in a room, her husband returning to the
attack on 'the boy. The frantic woman
broke' oat and a second time tried to
stop the furious man. Again she was
attacked and again' made a prisoner in
the house. After, the scene ended Mrs.
Mathews declared she would lake her
son to the office of the District Attorney
and get a warrant for her husband's ar
rest. She fays . her husband became
angry again at her statements and pro
duced a large carving knife with, which
he threatened to take her lite. He beat
her again, the sa!d. and locked her In
the room, but. with the assistance of her'
other children. Fbe gained ber'jiberty and
came to Oakland, where she told her
story at the District Attorney's office.
Mrs. Licht's first thought wa'sto save
her home from destruction and she
bravely seized the blazing kettle and
threw, it from the window/ Just as she
did so her little son, who had been at
tracted to the kitchen by the smoke
which was pouring from the door, ran
up the back steps, and the burning
mass passed so close to his face] that
some of the melted lard was sprinkled
on his clothing. Had the kettle struck
him it is likely that he would have been
fatally burned by the blazing grease
before aid could have reached him.
The Fire Department extinguished
the fire in the kitchen with but little
damage to the house, for most of the
fire went out after the kettle was
thrown from the window by Mrs. Licht.
The loss was about $25.

Mr. Merrill and his family are at
present traveling in Europe. The
house was in charge of a butler, who'
was absent last night ' on , a visit with
relatives. The mansion contained none
save the . two : Japanese, who retired
early in the eveninsr. v \u25a0 M
James and Ralph Merrill, sons of the
owner of the house, said they visited
the place shortly after *8- o'clock last
evening: and that everything ,waÂ« in
perfect order at that time. / They esti
mate the loss at $50.000. ;;\u25a0â¢'
The Merrill home was one of most
beautiful of the older residences of the
city. It contained a' very valuable art
collection and assortment of ; . bric-a
brac, together with furnishings v that
cost a fortune. Nearly the-entlre fit
tings of the house were ". damaged more
or less by either fire or water. ' The
loss will run .Into .'the thousands,
though It. is thought to be fully cov
ered by insurance. '
Patrolman .Lantze saw. flames shoot
ing from the roof of the mansion. He
turned in an alarm, and when the dis
trict chief arrived another was sent in.
Tho firemen worked valiantly and suc-1
ceeded in keeping the flames from
spreading to the adjoining mansions,
though for a time it was feared many
of them would be damaged.
Three Japanese servants,' who were
sleeping in the 'basement of the house,
heard a sharp explosion just before the
fire was discovered -by, Lantze. They,
rushed out only to! find the mansion on
flre. The Japanese could not throw any,
light on the cause, but \u25a0 from the â¢ fact
that they heard the explosion it is sur
mised that an accumulation of the
deadly monoxide paused (the blaze. ;
Fire broke out shortly after \u25a0 mid
night this morning in the palatial resi
dence of John F. Merrill at: the cornel
of Van Ness avenue and .Washington
street, and before the flames were ex
tinguished the upper floor, of the mans
ion was badly gutted. ' The Merrills are
away in Europe and the house was inj
charge of servants. The flre started. in
a dumb waiter on the third . floor and
is supposed to \u25a0 have been caused by an
explosion of gas.

XOMIXATIOX OP TICKET.
On motion of John S. Partridge, the
chair appointed a committee of three to
draft the usual petition for a place on the
ballot, and to submit in proper form a
cali for a nominating convention. The
chair named Mr. Partridge, C. C. Morris
and- Leon Samuels as the committee.
After a recess of ten minutes the sub
committee . reported . the following call
providing for a convention of 399 dele
gates to meet on September 19, 1905. and
the full committee adopted it:
Resolved, That we place upon our records
tm 8 expression of our sorrow and feeble testi
mony to the memory of our departed friend
and leader, and that enshrined in the history
of our civic and political itruggle for better
government the name of Thomas Daniel Rior
aan shall be ever recalled with love and
gratitude as passing time shall more fully
estimate his worth. '\u25a0\u25a0 .
Resolved. That the Republican County Com
mittee of the city and county of San Fran
cisco, voicing the sentiment of all Republi
can voters, as well 86 of all citizens of this
community, deeply deplore the untimely tak
ing off of Thomas Daniel Rlordan In the full
ness oi his powers and the ripeness of his in
tellect, and at a time of life when the vista
before him was one of friendships, ' love and
honor. \u25a0 ' ..Â»-.-
less energy. A patriot who loved and wor
shiped the American flag, who firmly, and
"tanchly believed that it was ever safe under
the guiding principles of the great Republi
can party, Mas Thomas Daniel Hiordan. Many
yearn will pass before the Republican party
can replace this indefatigable worker and un
selfish Uader both in local and .State affairs,
liis achievements make his memory imper
ishable, and it is the universal conviction
among all citizens that not only has the city
an <J county of San Francisco but the State
or California sustained, an loss by
the demise of its distinguished citizen, Thomas
Daniel Riordan. Therefore, be it
.C. D. Staples, former policeman, testi
fied for the defense, to having arrested
Wilson V Gray, father of Mrs. Adams'
child, for disturbing the peace and said
that when he searched' Gray he found
an unloaded revolver in his pocket. "/' He
later found several cartridges on the
mantel shelf in the house occupied by,
Gray and the defendant. It was then
the defendant was called. She testified
that Gray had threatened to blow her
brains out and just before the ' police
arrived she had taken the cartridges
out of the revolver and placed them on
the mantel shelf. Sergeant J.T. Dono
van' also testified to having seen the
furniture in the house of the defendant
and Gray broken up. j
Several character witnesses were
called and they all testified that the
defendant was kind to the boy. John
H. Tyrrell, a brother of the defendant,
testified that he was in the house on
the night of March 12 and the defend
ant was there all the. time till he went
to bed at 9:30 o'clock. She never wore
a cape of the kind described by Herlihy
and Cox, he said,, and other relatives
testified to the same effect.
The defense will make the most ; of
the discrepancy, 'for it wishes to show
that it was not Mrs. Adams who bought
theacid. If it can do so the charge
that sho forced her- two-year-old boy
to drink the poison and thus caused
his death on -March 13. 1899. will be
materially weakened.
The prosecution rested Its case with
Cox's testimony and Mrs. Adams was
called to the stand for a few minutes
by Judge Dibble to corroborate a state
ment made by one of the witnesses.
To-day she will give her entire version
of the boy's death. : ";/'
Oliver Thomas Cox, a gripman on the
Geary-street road, yesterday ; corrobor
ated the testimony of Police Corporal
Herllhy, who said. he saw ' Mrs." Minnie
Adams come from a drug store at
Devisadero and Geary.- streets on .the
night of March 12, 1899, and board a
Geary-street car. Cox's testimony
placed the time of her boarding the car
at about seventeen minutes later than
the time mentioned by Herlihy, v/ho
said he reached the corner at exactly
8:35, saw the woman come from the
store, tear the label off a bottle of car
bolic acid she had purchased and then
get on the car. all this taking from
four to ten minutes. Cox says his car
left Kearny street at 8:48 and that the
running time to Devisadero street was
fourteen minutes.

HERE is a very decided vogue among fashionable dressers for those
new dinner coats, and novel effects in these are: very ; much* sought,
after. And they are a very decided economy as well, for the ; correct
style calls for a widely different and contrasting sklrt ? tobe wornwith
them; in no instance are the coat and skirt to coincide, either as to color
or fabric/ 1 In -the illustration a' very clever effect is .achieved 'i with a
coat of the Dlrectoire period, and a plain * full skirt of - a silky iw.hite
sicilienne. The coat : is, in printed taffetas,: the back .fashioned with the
usual complement*' of seams, and "slit* up /the 1 center .to the waistline ; to
let-the full'folds of the skirt show through. The; fronts i come but half
way to the center, which is filled in /with a bodice of white chiffon,
shirred down the center. 'and with. handkerchief; shaped reveres'of lace
for. a finish at the bust -The coat Itself also: shows reveres,' these inter- *
lined with a princess ! haircloth and .rolled -back: gently *\u25a0 to " display the
embroidered \u25a0 chiffon facing. ;.\The; sleeve is a bullt-out full and billowy i
puff ; that', drops J Into ' a smart ; upturned " cu ff { above the elbow. ;. The skirt
is one of those" new circular cut. 'with i narrow pleats at theT band, - that
are not pressed at'all, and falls- In extremely full and swirling^ folds to
the feet. The length is : the new. round train. -.

*H*pHÃ discussion xtf the Norwegian question in the Swedish
I Riksdag has produced some war talk. The dignity of Sweden
\u25a0Â°*~ywas ruffled by the secession, and some members were of the
opinion that the only remedy was some bloodshed. This strikes the
, outside world as unnecessary. Violence lay behind the original
union of the two countries. It was not a willing compact in the
beginning. Each. was under its own constitution; with its own Par
liament, called in Norway the Storthing and in Sweden the Riksdag.
The common crown was about all there was of the union. Norway
bad her distinct national policy and ambitions, often at variance with
Â« 'the policy and ambitions of Sweden, though the people were of the
same'bldbd, and with only slight variations in language.
As Sweden was in no political sense the superior of Norway,
and. took but. little from the union, it is amazftig that any Swede
statesman should consider the matter worth fighting about. If we
were authorized to advise Sweden, we would say accept the offer
of Norway and take the Crown Prince of Sweden for King. The
% only concrete fact and matter of the union being the crowhj it would
be natural for the crown to be again united. in a few years upon the
head of the same Prince, and the two countries would be again itj
as substantial .union as they were before the secession.
* The Scandinavian is the parent stock of England and America,
and the stream has been renewed and; enriched by immigration to
the United States. If the question were left to the decision of Scan
dinavian Americans, the two countries would separate in peace and
remain united in friendship. It is a cold country to be hot-blooded
in, and the world will lament the spectacle of. bloodshed. Let
Sweden hasten to .recognize the independence ;; of . Norway and re
move a vexatious issue from the foreign offices of other nations.
THE COURSE OF SWEDEN.
ONE of the most remarkable In
stances in which a large sum of
money was lost through putting too
much faith in a dream occurred
about five years ago to a Colonel Booker,
who related the facts himself to the pres
ent writer, says Tit-Bits. In 1899 Colonel
Booker . was in* Mexico City, . and while
there: played roulette regularly in the
casino. One : night, after- winning a fair
amount,'; he /to rest and had- a
curious dream; He thought he was com
ing out of the theater with a lady on his
arm, when" a . cabman came up' to him
and asked \ him if he wanted ' a cab. The
colonel 'turned to the lady and inquired
if she Iwould ... ride, but she declined,
whereupon the cabman took a piece of
chalk from his \u25a0 pocket and marked the
colonel's sleeve with the number IL.--.Then
Colonel Booker awoke, and was so v much
impressed by. his dream that he believed
he had received a\bona-flde "Up" to put
his money on that number.
That evening he followed trie nocturnal
advice , and 105t. .; But so great a hold had
the dream taken upon him that he contin
ued to play, the same number, and though
he lost nineteen times out r ot twenty, he
persevered; for -several; days. at. the end
of which time he found his losses amount
ed I to : Â£5000. : Then, like; a .wise man j re
covered I from his foolishness, , the colonel
decided to "quit," and since then: he has
put very little . faith \u25a0In dreams as an aid
to successful gambling. :'\u25a0 â¢ . . ..
But Colonel ; ; Booker's experience , with
nocturnal' ''tips" '.was by ho means as dis-~
astrous as; that' of a certain 7 rich s young
man at Monte Carlo fsome few years ago.
Thla , young .fellow, , whom we will call
Smith," was a" s member! of} a well-known
and I highly ; respected-Devonshire family ;
he T had gone : the I "pace," and had - lost a
considerable "amount t in ' horse .\u25a0 racing j and
gambling," when one' night he, had a dream
which greatly ; impressed . itself .â¢ upon him;
and which was \ the : direct ' means Jof \u25a0 his
loslngjtne remainder of his fortune.' '
,He \ thought 'â¢ he , was .standing ! in /the"

lice :"officer; came.; along cwlth , a squad
of gendarmes and^halted within a hun TJ
dfed i feet \of him.;; He *;' watched * them"
Idly, and vi soon " experienced .'\u25a0 an tuncon
trollable desire ' to : find out / how many
there" were, but; just'as he began to
count the officer Issued peremptory
commands, which were so promptly
obeyed that the dreamer had no chance
of satisfying his curiosity. Finally,
however, -the men stood in single file
facing their officer, and Mr. Smith, was
just able to make out that there were
27 in all when he awoke.
Being superstitious, like all gamblers,
he at once saw In his dream the nn
gerot fate silently pointing to 27 *as
the' lucky number, and tbe following:
day he was early at the tables and
staked a large sum on it. Curiously
enough. , 27 won twice in succession.
and then the luck changed and -he be
gan to lose steadily. Most of that day
he played his favorite number without
success, and when the casino closed
that night he had lost a considerable
amount of money. * -
The next day he continued to play
the same number with. the same result,
and. to cut. a long: story short, that
fatal 27 ran away with every penny
he .possessed, -and he was only 'pre
vented- from .shooting himself by an
interested ' spectator who followed him
out of the casino, and by tact and the
loan of a small. sum induced him to
face his misfortune like a man. Those
to whom Mr. Smith afterward related
the \u25a0 circumstance of the dream - de
clared tuat he had made a mistake in
not. counting the officer as well as the
gendarmes." \u25a0' V/

*-pHE late Senator Hoar said that the integrity and perpetuity
I of onr institutions depend upon making the ballot-box as pure
* as the altar. It is sure that the collapse of free government is
certain if corruption . of the ballot-box go on unchecked. In every
American city that has a government steeped in crime and run by
graft and for graft the ballot-box has been left open to the crim
inals by which to entrench themselves in power that they misuse.
Folk found that to be the case in St. Louis. It is notorious in
Chicago. It is practiced in Baltimore.' It has been the system of
Tammany in New . York. It made official Cincinnati a den of
thieves. Mayor Weaver finds it so in Philadelphia, where three
members of the push have just been sentenced to prison for cor
ruption of the ballot. It is in San Francisco the weapon of the
system, used .by the push. Any one who thinks that only the
three men now under conviction here were engaged in the dirty
work is mistaken. The crime of which they were convicted is not
peculiar to one. precinct or to one district. It has been common
wherever it was necessary to control the municipal government. It
is also a mistake to conclude that the convictions that have fol
lowed detection have had an admonitory effect upon those who
have not been exposed and punished. The countenance and en
couragement, trie help and approval from high places in the city
government, have efficiently offset any fear that may have been
inspired by the punishment of their partners in crime.
Graft, blackmail and rakeoff go on as if they were a legitimate
function of government, and an appeal is made for the support of
even' vicious element in the city, to the end that the system may
survive against all efforts at reform. The legal punishment that
has in three cases overcome official ppotection of crime is the merest
scratching of the surface. The system is as insensible to it as a
rock to the scratching of its outside. What is needed is a sledge
hammer blow to shatter it. When hammered into powder the sys
tem, like the rock, cannot well reintegrate itself. Such a blow is
proposed by the Republican League. It intends to prove that one
party at least, backed by the independent vote of the city, can
cleanse itself of responsibility for the disgrace of San Francisco, and
at the same time deliver the city from the toils of the system.
This is not a movement of theoretical or impractical reformers,
who usually content themselves with being horrified at a condition
they do not attempt to remedy. The sj'stem is jocund when such
reformers speak. But its hilarity ceases when practical men act to
gether, and by practical means join their forces for its overthrow.
The work so far has disclosed the symptoms of a deeply seated
municipal disease, which begins in the ballot-box and smites every
branch of the government with actual corruption, or with indiffer
ence to its existence. â¢ ..
;. . The Call has noted the work of the literary syndicate that has
its headquarters in the newspaper organs of ballot-box stuffing and
public corruption. That syndicate discloses, unintentionally, the
situation here. The articles it is publishing in the outside press
are boastful of the perpetuity of graft and defy any power to defeat
it. Among the reasons given is the boast of a partnership between
powerful combinations of contractors and corporations with the
system to which they look for protection. It is interesting that this
boast is accompanied by covert threats of vengeance on all who op
pose the system, and by the declaration that with such allies its
fight is already won. Rightly read and understood, this boasting
gives the strongest reason why the people of San Francisco should
join fists and smite this partnership.
Another boast is made that the grafters have a war chest
greater than can be brought against them by the people. This
means that the money of the people, secured by a rakeoff of official
salaries, by the blackmailing of private business, added to the, con
tributions of protected predatory combinations, . is to be used to
defeat the purification of this city government. Such a combination
is not new. That sort of criminal partnership existed here before
the Vigilance Committee. It was so conscious of its power and so
impudent in displaying it that an assassin rode in the Sheriff's
buggy to murder a citizen who had protested against public corrup
tion. The town then was in the official grasp of scoundrels and
murder, burglary, highway robbery and vice flourished,
cÂ»* The reaction was violent. It was in the form of resumption
of the means of order by-the people themselves and justice was taken
u out of the hands of officers who were no better than the criminals
to* whom they gave immunity, and was sternly administered by the
organized public. Who shall deny that we have now the signs of
the same condition of things? Murder is done in the streets. Citi
zens are held up at their very doors by thugs. Highwaymen ply
their trade in the plazas. Burglars sack homes. Vice flaunts its
red sign, and the members of the government who should stop all
this are so busy at official looting, grafting, blackmail and rakeoff:
that the city is as unprotected as a flock without a shepherd. The
great public agencies of government, paid by the people as the in
struments of law, order and safety, are diverted to instrumentalities
of private gain, and the public safety is left to shift for itself.
The people are surfeited with this sort of government. They'
intend to end it peacefully at the ballot-box- If the boast that the
war chest of corruption caii defeat them is made good, and private
crime flourishes in the shadow of public corruption, both unchecked,
what remedy is there, except the resumption of the. proper powers
of government by the people themselves?
CORRUPTING THE BALLOT-BOX.
Epictetus pointed this out when he said: "If any one should set your body
at the . mercy of every passer-by, you would be indignant. When, therefore,
you set your own mind at the mercy of every chance to be troubled and per
turbed when any one may revile you, have you no shame of this?"
If you find you have this tendency to, fret yourself because of the world's
opinion, make., every attempt to check It before it .controls 'you. ' Nothing . could
make you more, unhappy. Nothing could more surely deprive you of the irhole
some character you really wish to attain.
Recently she was decidedly misjudged by some one who had no means of
knowing her as she really lived, and when she learned of the fact she was
plunged In misery for days.
She can see no reason for any such occurrence in her life and is bitter over
the injustice of it. If she would -forget herself and look about her she would
soon learn that such misrepresentation is going on in the world every dayâ that
no one is immune from it.
are of right doing?
If ; you have not yet achieved this. attitude toward life, the sooner you set
about acquiring it the better, for you /will discover, if you have not already done
so. that* rear happiness and growth are Impossible Without it."*.-'
A very serious [fault- of 'many \u25a0exemplary characters is an undue anxiety that
the world shall give' them full credit for their goodness. It â¢ Is perfectly natural
that one should wish for the good opin
ion of others, yet that wish should:. not
be the pivot for one's conduct, nor should
the fact of being misjudged interfere ma
terially with one's peace of mind. :,
\u25a0 If you know you: are living up to your
highest standard, living "square" with
your best self,, it. ought 'not to disturb you
to discover that you are not given credit
for it by people . who fail to understand
you or -who willfully misjudge you.
So many persons i whose \ strength of
character ; ought to' keep^ them, from in
dulging in such weakness allow them
selves to suffer the . keenest j pangs of
misery -when others "bear false witness"
against them.
Life Is too precious a thing to be spoiled
by ' such ' ; unnecessary ? hobnobbing with
trouble, a practice is entirely in
consistent with the highest Ideal of char r
acter;' r To : waste one's energy worrying
about what "people" think and agonizing
over the wrong impressions, the world
has of one's conduct i 3 a species of
spiritual suicide. \u25a0 ;
I know a woman whose life is very
miserable because she spends her" days
worrying about other people's, opinion of
her. Instead of being content with her
own | knowledge of her . motives and ac
tions,' she ; wonders constantly , if perhaps
after all Mrs. So-and-So may not believe
her to be a hyprocrite or her next door
neighbor look upon her as a pretender to
virtues she does not possess.
She is so: anxious lest some one mis
judge her that she patterns her life along
lines ~ unnecessarily, narrow and cheats
herself of much, harmless pleasure and
enjoyment. And what is her reward?
Unhapplness and 'anxiety ' always â an
utterly hopeless struggle to conform to
the ideas other people have of what her,
conduct should be.

Health Board employes in the. pure
food department who are not residents
of ; thjB coanty are having a^turnwlth
the Grand Jury. That body is investi
gating * their appointments.' holding:
that they are illegal' under the charter.
Among those whose eruEloyment is
considered illegal is H. D. Gibbs,
assistant superintendent of the depart
ment, named, who receiver a salary of
$200 per month. Gibbs is a university
man, and was not a resident of this
city at the time the Health Board ap
pointed him to the place, some two
months ago.
|C. W. Beaver, an assistant chemist
in the department. Is also said to be
a non-resident, bis name not appearing
in the local directory. P. L. McCreary.
Carlton C. James. W. H. Sloan and Q.
D, Barnett are also employed as as
sistant chemist 3 and their names are
not in the . local directory .and the
Grand Jury claims they are non-rest
dents. .
Section 2, article XVI of the -char
ter governs the matter, and Is as fol
lows:
'/All deputies, clerks, assistants and
other employes of the city, and county
must be citizens of the United States,
and must, during their respective terms
of office or employment, actually re
side in the city and county, and must
â¢have so resided for one year next pre
ceding their appointment."
The 1 Civil Service Commission has also
notitied the Board, of Health that the
appointments of the employes who do
not reside in this city and who have
not so resided for one year prior : to
their appointment are in direct viola
tion of the charter and are therefore
illegal.
The employes named come from the
universities, and it is said they do not
owe their appointment either to Abe
Ruef or to Mayor Schmitz, but to Dr.
Ward, president of the Health Board.
In his zeal for the improvement of the
pure food department Dr. Ward ap
pears to have ignored the plain pro
visions of the charter, so the Grand
Jury thinks.
Norman F. Titus, who lives in Berke
ley, was employed for a time as as
sistant chemist, but he recently re
signed and was succeeded by G. D. Bar
nett.

The six boys manfully decline to give
the name of this modern Helen who
upset the affairs of the school.
Attorney Cannon swore to a warrant
for the arrest of the six hazers yester
day for false Imprisonment, but after
a consultation with Judge Cabaniss re
frained from signing it. He may swear
to a fresh warrant to-day for assault.
The parents of Smith, Mason and Free
man have written to him, apologizing
for the actions of their young hopefuls.
Six members of the Alpha Neu So
ciety at the Mission High School will
probably be \ brought into the Police
Colirt to-day to explain. a little lark of
theirs on May. 27. They areJcharged
with enveloping the head of Klngsley 1
Cannon, stepson of Attorney AVilliam
M. Cannon, in a potato sack. and walk
ing him blindfolded. through the park,
terrorizing the youth with the threat
of a cold plunge 'in Stow Lake. The
boys accused are Harry Stafford, son
of ex-Judge Stafford; Aubrey Leib.
Albert Devlin, Thomas Smith, Charles
Mason and George Freeman.
//According to young Cannon's story,
he was waiting for a car at the corner
of Dolores and Eighteenth streets, when
he was suddenly seized from behind. 'A
sack was thrown over his head, and
Cannon, believing that it wasa hold
up and "fearing great bodily harm,"
said. "Take my money. I give up!" ;
But his laughing captors marched
him up the. street, still keeping him
blindfolded. For over three hours they
inarched him along with th?m, though
he. begged to be released. After he had
been walked for nearly two hours he
heard one of his captors say, "Well,
Stow Lake is good and cold."
"The beach is a whole lot colder,"
suggested another, and Cannon was
still walked up hills and down dale.
Finally the hazers freed their victim
near Haight and Stanyan streets, after
threatening him if he divulged ; the
secrets of the Alpha Neu. . Young Can
non had intended to go to p an enter
tainment, where he was to appear as
attorney at a mock trial.
Cannon was to plead for a merry
young high school girl, who was to
pose as plaintiff in a mock divorce trial.
The young lady has evidently thrown
her spell over many of the youths at
the Mission High School and Cannon's
alleged incarceration was probably
prompted by Jealousy. The male stu
dents of the high school were jealous
of the honor accorded to him- and
wanted to keep him away, from the
"trial" so that he might not win fresh
favor in â¢ the eyes of the belle of the
school.

POUGHKEEPSIE; N. T.. June 23.â
Cornell regained her prestlgre In Inter
collegiate rowing affairs to-day by win
ning with utmost ease the varsity eight
oar and freshman eight-oar races In tha
intercollegiate regatta. Syracuse was
given the decision in the varsity fourÂ»oar
race, after a sensational and exasperat
ing "mix-up," in which the Judges gava
out conflicting decisions, the victory be
ing given first to Cornell, although Syra
cuse came in first. .
The hesitation over the dlclsion was
due to â¢ two factsâ first, that some of
those In the judges* boat \u25a0 were in doubt
as to the Identity of the leading crew
as they passed the finish mark; second,
that at the outset of the race Syracuse
is declared to have passed - out of her
course In front of Columbia,- and thera
was claim of a disqualifying foul against
her. After a long delay the decision-was
reversed and declared in favor of Syra
cuse. The three races were rowed under
ideal conditions over the beautiful and
historic Hudson River course, stretching
four miles, from Krum Elbow to a point
one mile below the towering steel bridgs
which Joins Poughkeepsie and the High
lands, wjy
CORNELL NEVER HEADED.
In the varsity race, the feature cf thÂ»
day, Cornell, never pressed after the first
quarter-mile had been covered, rowed
across the finishing line a dozen lengths
or more in front of the crew from Syra
cuse, which surprised the aquatic world
by winning this event last year.
Thoroughly beaten, but struggling to
the last limit of endurance for the honors
of third place, Georgetown and Columbia
swept by the Judges' boat almost to
gether, Georgetown having the slightest
of advantages. Back in the ruck cams
Pennsylvania, and last of all finished
Wisconsin, whose chances had been fa
vorably considered by the rowing ex
perts.
Cornell won the freshman race for
eight-oared shells almost as easily, again
having Syracuse as her nearest competi
tor. The order of the finish in last year's
freshman race was just the reverse, Syr
acuse having won and having been con
sidered a strong factor in to-day's two
mile sprint.
In the four-oarded varsity race Syra
cuse won. with Cornell second, Cornell
and Syracuse thus almost evenly dlvld
tag the honors of the day, the former
getting two firsts and a second and the
latter one first and two seconds. "Wis
consin furnished a big surprise by finish
ing last; :"-â¢
SYRACUSE PERFORMS WELL.
Columbia's crews redeemed themselves
to a degree by their fine effort for third
honors in the varsity.
. Georgetown rowed much better thaa
expected, and Pennsylvania lived tip to
the predictions. that had been made con
cerning her crews.-
Syracuse, by her clever work to-day,
following the two victories of la3t year,
has finally established herself in the row
ing affairs of the intercollegiate asaocia-Â»
tion, and is undoubtedly to bo reckoned
with in all , future regattas.

Graphic and Accurate Report of the^Championship Battle
at Reno Wil^
In keeping with its policy to present to its readers the latest- news in at
tractive and authoritative form, The Call is making special arrangements to prop
erly report the championship fight between Marvin Hart and Jack Root, which
will take place at Reno, Nev., oh Monday next. \
Robert A. Smyth, The Call's sporting editor, will be at the ringside to
record for its readers>f he scenes and incidents; attending this .championship battle,.
wHich also marks the^ first 'finish fight decided in America since the, memorable
one between Fitzsimmons and Corbett. \
While authorities differ as to the right of James J. Jeffries to cede his.
title, that mightiest of modern gladiators will be inside the ropes as referee, and
when he points to ths winner he will proclaim him champion. ;\u25a0 When the man
tle drops irom the shoulders of the invincible, herculean Jeffries, another scramble
extending over years will ensue for possession of the title. ,
There will be life and color and action at the Nevada ringside, all of
which will be fairhfuUy depicted for the benefit. of The Call's sporting clientele.
Mr. Smyth brings to his task a keen knowledge ot boxing, having report
ed for this paper all the championship fights held here for many years. As a judge
of condition in athletes in all departments of sport, he has no superior among
American sporting writers- having; made this a deep study. His criticisms of
championship battles have been notably just and impartial and invariably reflect
the views of the major portion of the spectators.

For several years I suffered -with Chills

I have never been troubled since. lam

me so complete and immediate relief,

SUMMARY.
PORTLAND^ v June 28â Umpire Per
rine incurred the enmity ._ of the
bleachers again to-day for decisions
in : the.' game Portland"; lost
to Tacoma by a score of 7- to
3.. He, was mobbed on 'the field and
was escorted home by two policemen to
â¢prevent rowdies from dolng-hinvinjury.
The better. class, of fans are annoyed at
the occurrence, although they, consider
Perrine incompetent. The fans were in'
bad temperA as French hadbeenpound
ed out of the box in the^third. Only one
run was scored by â¢the Tigers In. this
Inning, "but French dsk*?d to bo relieved.
The' fans hooted Perrinc's decision on
strikes. : After that ' every., adverse de
cision called : down- - jeers from- : the
cr6wd.' r ;The 'game had no batting fea
tures, though Tacoma made, most of its
runs after two men were. out.
Â» The trouble. against Perrine arose- in
the sixth," when; tho crowd surged in the
field and was only stopped j from a dis
graceful attack on the defenseless uni
pire by the police and players interven

SUMMARY. \u25a0
Los Angeles bumped Hitt safely nino
times, but they were all. wasted with
the exception *of .Ross' single in :' the
fourth and Dillon's in the. ninth, both
of which, by thÂ« way, were scratchy
ones. The Angels had a chance in the
seventh when Bernard led off with a
single. . Davis declared, him out at sec
ond, â¢. though he was safe^a mile. This
t6ok. ! a'lot of ginger out of the Southern
bandT- and possibly cost them .victory.

-RUNS AND HITS BY INNINGS. /
Gray > was;; at fault when he let the
Seals two through on him in the
fourth. With, two faded Wheeler hit
and Dolly issued a pass to Hildebrand.
Irwin slapped to right and scored
Georgie. The sanctimonious south
winger; passed Nealon and Wilson in a
row, ..forcing Hilde over with another
run.
At that the Bluebells managed to
make it a deadlock in the ninth, when
Tim Flood. walked, stole, took third on
Smith's out. and came tearing in on
Dillon's scratchy hit that 'was barely,
good enough to give' the leader of the
tribe a life at first. The Seals came
back so rapidly, and won out so cleverly
it' seemed they could turn such a trick
every day in their lives.
Tozier, who relieved Dolly Gray in
the eighth, kissed his game good-by
when he walked Wheeler and bumped
Hildebrand in .the slats during the last
period. Uncle Charley, Irwin laid down
a sacrifice^ iand' Brother Joe Nealon
smote a low.' rakish one out to center
that is undoubtedly going yet, for no
one chased'lt, as the game was over

bbili. , '-; ;.-^- ~-..~>
The Mariposa returned to Pacific
Ft roe t about 6 o'clock and in getting his
ship to her berth Captain Howard
found, that docking a liner* Is not al
ways the simple matter it looks from
the wharf. \ c
In addition -to satisfying: JJncle Sam
that she could surpass his utmost exac
tior.s. in Â«very respect, the Mariposa
also 'gave evidence to the French Gov
ernment that she still can more tlian
qualify to -carry the French mails.
The. Mariposa and her twin sister, the
Alatneda.' have a world-wide reputation
ns capable .and â¢ consistent travelers.
Their -record "when they carried the
British mails. to Australia Is still a by
word in the postal world and the peo
ple "of Honolulu still regulate their
â¢ locks ahd watches by the going and
coming of the Alameda. The people of
Tahiti could 'put the .Mariposa to simi
lar, use, but. in the South Seas nobody
worries about, such a trivial matter as
"tl;e correct time."
Captain H. 2. Howard, superintendent
of . the steamship company, was in
command' of the liner during the trip,
near Admiral William 11. Whking, Cap
tain Holland N.. Stevenson . and Naval
Constructor John G. Tawrcsey consti
tuted the naval 1 board detailed to sit
In judgment oz\ the liner's performance.
The " llariposA left Pacific-street
xcharf at ?. o'clock-" fcmd proceeded di
l^c.i'ly. to sea. Outside .the head she
â¢was run jufull speed for six hours and
es'. she', traveled .through the ocean
F>vells tbe'n&xy officers' made careful
note of her behavior. At the end of the
fix hour* rt wÂ»j found ' that she had
averaged : a little better than sixteen
knots -an hour, developing 3957 hbrse
j>ower. '.with eighty-one revolutions to
the minute.. . Her engines worked
Fmootlily and at the end of the trial not
a- bearing showed a sign of heat.'
\u25a0T4ie Oi'oahic Steamship Company's
lia<Â»r Mariposa. svas given an ocean trial
trip ycptcidajfc for the purpose of
demonstrating to a naval board that
the "steamship had all the qualifications
exacted under the act of 1891 of auxil
iary cruisers. She exceeded the speed
requirement by more than two knots
end in every other respect won the
unanimous approval of the naval board.
The United Stales recently asked, for
bids for carrying the United States
maps between here and Honolulu. The
awarding of the contract to the Oceanic
Sreatnship Company depended â¢ upon
yesterday's trial. Under the law the
qualifications required ability, to de
velop ah average speed of fourteen
knots and the stability to mount four
Kix-fnJch suns and, a secondary battery
of smaller caliber. In other words.
Vf.cle Sam will not- award mail con
tracts on-, ocean routes to vessels

New York Cotton Market.
NEW" YORK. June 28.â COTTONâ The sen
sational advance of 50 points that the cotton
market made to-day j was the result â¢of â¢ a
stampede among the shorts and heavy buy
l.ig by spot dealers and spinning interests as
well as the generality of speculators. In ap
prehension of what appears ; to be the menace
of something in the nature of a crop, failure.
With the heavy rains throughout Texas and j
.the Mississippi Valley , of the last four days
going a great ways toward offsetting th-e bear
ish sentimental ; influence of .the moderately
favorable Government report, expected Mon
day, shorts have. been covering rapidly and
there has been heavy buying by spinning In
terests and spot dealers and a large bull spec
ulation coming In from southern and local
operators. It would be hazardous to predict
the immediate future course of prices, but the
opir.lon is that the market Is advancing too
rapidly and Is discounting too much of what is
known and expected from the present condi
tions of crop arid trade outlook.
The Journal of Commerce says: "Cotton shows
improvement in Louisiana and Alabama. We
may go higher. Public haw a craze to buy.

The circular of Somera & Co. says of Hay:
"Shipments 'of Hay \u25a0 have been ' moderately
heavy during * the . past | week." ; considering the
rather ' ~uiet demand that Iwe always experi
ence just before the Fourth of July, 2500 tons
having arrived, in comparison : with 2SOO tons
for the â¢ week- preceding., â¢ The new crop has
been somewhat in evidence during the past
few days, about one-quarter, of the present ar
rivals being new. Choicer grades . of Wheat
and Wheat and - Oat are selling well, whereas
anything that -is of but medium quality goes
at very low prices. It is difficult to quote
any definite standard for new, crop, for re
ceivers here have ' very dl"'--"t ideas ;as to
values; Reports go to show that the State has
a much larger Hay crop than that of last
year, although the pronortfon of good quality
will be smaller. There Is no outside demand
whatever at the moment, -. nor. ts there anything
in sight to encourage the market; both north
and south of us the crop. is very plentiful bo
that; unless some unexpected foreign demand
a rises, practically all shipments must go for
local consumption.

The officials of the Ocean Shore Rail
way Company appeared , before the Su
pervisors' Street Committee yesterday to
urge Immediate; action on its petition for
a fifty years' franchise to operate a rail
road in the 1 Sunset and Richmond dis
tricts to connect with the main line cenr
tering at- Army and Illinois, streets. As
there was no quorum- present no action
was taken, but . the officials were advised
to ' arrange a V conference with their" en
gineers and the - City Engineer for the
purpose of settling; upon the preliminary
street 'surveys ; and alignments on the
proposed route. ! The committee will con
sider the petition at next Wednesday's
meetiftg. The company has already ap
plied to the City Engineer for. a map of
the various official : street lines.
The committee postponed for one week
consideration of the offer of : the Mer
chants' Cold Storage and Ice Company
to furnish 1,000,000 gallons of salt water
daily for sprinkling -the^ public streets.
It; is planned to secure from the. United
Railroads- one or two; sprinkling cars after
the necessary pipe "connections are made.
Superintendent of Street Sweepers Cow
den requested the committee not to take
any money away from the street-sweep
ing fund for t be purpose. Cowden said
that the appropriation 1 of $215,000 -was
barely sufficient; ;to sweep the- streets
properly and that only twenty-five sweep
ers are at work this ; month. Supervisor
Boxton" "suggested that \the\ use of the
salt water would result in 1 a\ saving of
$500 monthly â¢ now % paid to : the Spring
Valley Water* Company for fresh water.
In all likelihood . the offer will be ac
cepted. -- Tirey L. Ford informed the com
mittee" that the United Railroads uses
sprinkling cars on the San Mateo road
at* present and has no other cars for the
purpose. Â«i:
An opinion of Importance to material
men, contractors and mechanics.' was
handed down yesterday by Judge Seawell
in the suit of Jocelyn against Arnold, lrÂ£
volving the question of lien growing out
of . the abandonment by Williams Bros.,
contractors, of work on the home of
Robert Oxnard on Broadway, near Bu
chanan street. Judge Seawell goes fully
Into the lien law of the State and con
cludes with the opinion that section 1200
of the Code of Civil Procedure is uncon
stitutional.
At the time of the abandonment of the
work by Williams Bros., Mr. Oxnard had
paid 53130, 0n the total contract price.
$16,270. Immediately;, thereafter Hens
against the building were filed, aggregat
ing in all $10,000. ; Mr. Oxnard then fin
ished the building, depositing with tne
court 51566 15, the difference between the
actual. cost "and the contract price. The
case then went to trial. .
The* code section Judge Seawell holds
unconstitutional provides that when a
contractor fails to complete or abandons
his contract .before completion, the por
tion of the contract price applicable to
the liens of others than the contractor
shall be fixed by deducting from the value
of tho work done and materials delivered
on the ground; the. sum of money paid
and. actually due at- the time of aban
donmentâthe materials on the- ground
thenceforth', to .be- the property of .'the
owner.M. '...' , !
Tho court holds that the contentions of
â¢Mr. Oxnard should be sustained, and in
passing upon section 1200 asserts that Its
language Is uncertain an%T difficult to In
terpret; that" an 'abandoned, uncompleted
building is not worth Its proportion of the
total contract price: that the owner
should not be obliged to accept the mate
rials delivered on the ground, and,
finally, that the sum to which the mate
rial men and mechanics should be limited
is.lo be obtained by deducting the reas
onable cost of tne building from the con
tract price, the* owner having the . privi
lege " of completing the building himself.
The : theory of ' this _is that the owner
should not be called , upon to pay more
than the i original contract price for his
building. . - u ? i^Â« ifjjÃffiggHÃg
â¢ Under this decision the court held tliat
Hen-holders were limited In their recovery
to the fund of $1865 13 deposited :In court
by Mr. Oxnard.

"He doesn't know how to earn an
honest livelihood and wouldn't earn it if
he did know how," was the estimate of
John Warned's character tendered by
the patrolman who had arrested him
for "stealing a sack of sugar from the
wholesale grocery of Wellman, Peck &
Co. on' East street, between Pacific and
Jackson, last Tuesday afternoon. .
But the .accusation of theft was
sturdily combated by Mr. Warned.
While sauntering past the grocery, he
informed Police Judge Conlan, a
stranger accosted him with an offer to
bet 50 cents that he, Mr. W., could not
lift and carry a sack of sugar which
lay upon the sidewalk. > Proud of ' his
muscular strength, Mr. Warned prompt
ly accepted the wager and was in pro
cess of winning it with ease when two
clerks from the grocery compassed his
arrest on the charge of stealing, his
burden. "It was a most absurd blunder
on their part," he declared.
"Who held the stakes?" inquired his
Honor. ':%\u25a0;â¢ '
"The man who proposed the bet,".re
plied Mr. Warned.- .
"What became of him?".
"I'll give It up."
'Twas then the policeman put in his
estimate of Mr. Warned's character
and supplemented it with the statement
that he had "kept track" of the man
for- several years- and was therefore
qualified to know whereof he testified.
"That bet story Is rot," he concluded.
"I think so, too," said the Judge, x
Mr. Warned will be sentenced to-day
for petty larceny. .
George O'Brien, who was shot by
Samuel Cohen because he would not
pay $500 in return for his alleged
alienation of Mrs. Cohen's affections,
Informed Judge Mogan that he did not
desire to file formal complaint against
his assailant. / ; ;V^ > *; V
"Why?" the Judge asked.
"Well, because â becauseâ my mother
Is sick," was the stammering answer.
"And you want to -be constantly by
her side, I suppose?" said his Honor,
dryly. ; S?-*:f
' "Yes, sir." .
"Well, we'll take and transcribe your
testimony right now and thus obviate
the necessity of your coming here
again," was the unexpected proposal.
But still Mr. .O'Brien balked. Then
the -Judge sent for Detective. Ross
Whittaker, who had , worked up the
case, and requested him to swear to a
complaint, but Mr. Whittaker. also de
clined, to "do so, his stated reason be
ing that other police o/flcers knew more
about the shooting than he did. The
Judge thereupon ordered that subpenas
be Issued to Patrolmen Mitchell. Cor
nelius and Hostetter and that Mr.
O'Brien be detained in custody as a wit
ness until the desired complaint be
filed. To this ruling Mr. O'Brien en
tered demurrer, but the Judge stood
firm and declared that the case would
not be "fixed" -if . he could prevent.it.
Mr. O'Brien's' obstinacy n^elted ere he
was jn custody half an hour/ He sub
scribed to the complaint and was re
leased,- and then -the case was set for
hearing to-day.
Cohen Is at liberty on $2500 bail. His
shooting of O'Brien, who is a build
ing contractor, occurred one evening
about six weeks ago at Golden Gate
and Van Ness avenues. Three bullets
were pumpedinto O'Brien's body from
a 22-caliber revolver, and to the small
caliber of the weapon he owes his life.
As It was, he spent several weeks In a
hospital, where he stated that Cohen,
after accusing him of paying undue at
tentions to Mrs. Cohen, demanded $500
as balm for his wounded marital honor,
and' began shooting when his demand
was rejected.
J. Walter Laymance forfeited the
$200 which he Lad deposited as security

Proceedings in contempt , against the
San Francisco Labor Council and the va
rious unions of brewery workers, against
whom citation was issued upon affidavit
of the Seattle Malting and Brewing
Company, was continued yesterday by.
Judge Murasky until; this morning for
hearing. \u0084The respondents were present
with their attorney, but the court ' de
cided "to first" dispose of the petition for
Injunction against ; the ; Cooks' and the
.Waiters' unions , filed iby A;: J. . Kasta,
owner of a restaurant "at 21 Sixth street.
On behalf of the petitioners It was ad
mitted that the cooks and - the waiters
had the right 'to quit work if they so
desired and to make a condition upon
which they would remain at work that
they, be not required to work with non
union men, but there their rights ended
and they committed a breach of the law
the moment tuey instituted boycotts,
placed pickets and endeavored to harass
and intimidate j the employers. '
The claim was made on behalf of the
defendant unions that they had only
used peaceful -means in an effort to at
tain, their end, but this claim was met
by counter affidavits of the . employer.
Upon this joinder of issues the argument
proceeded. T. C. \an Ness, who repre
sents the plaintiff and who, is associated
with Aitorney Bush : Finnell ln^ the pre
sentation of the petitions for similar re
lief filed, by a score of employers, first ad
dressed the court. \u25a0. \u25a0
FOLLOW' ENGLISH CASE.
"The courts of America," said Mr. Van
Ness, "ere now advancing in cases in
volving the questions here raised along
the lines of ti.e rule laid down -n Eng
land's highest court. The iirst case that
reached that court included . the question
of the right of^employes to cease' their
labor, in a body, to /strike ,' as it Is com
monly called. In that case the men had
quit their employment owing to; the. fact
that non-union men were given work ; be
side them.' As they were persistent in
their stand that -.they would . not i return
until . the non-union men were discharged
the employers were finally forced to ' dis
charge the non-union men, the services
of the union men being the more valuable.
The discharged employes, carried the case
to the courts and upon this action the
opinion of the higher court was founded.
'.'The court held. that employes had the
right at any and all times to quit their
wor^kand walk -out ..in a body and . that
they ; also had the right to say upon what
conditions they would remain in the em
ploy of any person ; or firm; their right
to even demand that non-union men be
discharged as a condition upon which
they would remain at their work not
being questioned. In other words, em
ployes, held the court, could place; any
condition they desired upon their posi
tions, and had the, right to quit their
work if the conditions so imposed were
not honored in every way "by the em
ployers. *
CO BEYOND RIGHTS;
"Emboldened by this decision of the
highest court of their land the English
union members went ; further and 'finally,
when their demands as -to.' the. discharge
of non-union men and higher wages and
shorter hours' were not granted, they
proceeded with the; boycott, placed pick
ets-and sought to intimidate to -attain
their, ends.; This ""case '.was carried to. the
upper court and here came the decision
upon which the' courts of 'America now
base theirs. .
"This decision was to the effect that
evÂ«n though it were true that,, employes
had the right* to name: any conditions
they^, desired; to even demand .the dis
charge of. non-unionvmen under threat
of. a walkout, their rights ; ended ,in
event tlfelr demand, was denied ; when
they exercised their: right to; walk out.
After walking out they had j done all
they . could legally do" and the court
firmly held that they had' no 'right! to
boycott,, to picket or to; intimidate; -.they
might walk out .as -. they pleasedf but
there their lfgal right; to injure ended.
"This is- the theory upon which we are
proceeding in this case*," continued Mr.
Van Ness. "We do ; not for a" moment
question the right: of the cooks aiid f the
waiters to quit their employment -at any
time or for any reason they please.
After they ' have quit, however.,' we hold
that there their; rights; end and , that in
boycotting/ picketing "and Intimidating
others who have; taken .their place we
hold they violate the la w^ and should be
forever enjoined , from . pursuing such
tactics." . : , \u25a0 '' \u0084" . . ..'.'\u25a0
MARBLE OUTLINES STAND.
; Attorney Marblo f - who represents the
unions, said that while ; lt- was true that
pickets had been stationed tin : front; of
tho*! restaurant ' of the =">. petitioner.:, and
others they had! committed no overt acts
and had conducted themselves ; In ; a quiet,
peaceful manner. \u25a0 Â« ' . \u25a0 '
"Picketing^ If 'quietly -carried on, can
not ba declared a nuisance," said Marble.'
"It cannot be declared a nuisance because
people are stationed on the sidewalk, be-;
causo It is a presumption of. law. and Is a
fact.' capable ;qf j proof ; ; that' people":* are
standing t and . passing -.up - and 'â¢' down J In
front of restaurants on the public .streets
at all hours.". ,', ' '. " . -. â¢
/But you will condede, "will you not,"
asked Attorney .'Van' 1 Ness/ '-'that -people
cannot combine^ to injure a person's
business?!' "
"What;- we ; concede,".^ answered ,; Mar
ble, "is that : labor unions Â£ have "-no
right ; to *: combine S to "\u25a0* exercise '.-.- unlawful
acts , against .the ; proprietors f of : ; places Â» of

the i defendants >';.were~j notY exercising ; un
lawful acts, but " were C fully ' within ' the
spiritVof i the: letter Vof Uhe'i law. V> ;
v "It; seems -to jme,"', answered Van Ness,
"that ' the ' answer 'consists alone : of words ; :
itiis .not* argument." .',".-' .-*
This .concluded- the \l discussion and the
case was taken \u25a0 under 'advisement. J
