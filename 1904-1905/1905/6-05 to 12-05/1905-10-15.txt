\u25a0nd the ones which made Dr.
Doyle* tame. They arc entire

of Sherlock Holmes."

fHK Lord St. Simon marriage and
Its curious termination have lone
ceased to be a subject of Interest
in those exalted circles In which
the unfortunate bridegroom
novn. Fresh scandals have eclipsed
It, and their more piquant details have
drawn the gossips away from this
four-year-ola drama. As I have rea
son to believe, however, that the full,
facts have never been revealed to the
general public, and as my friend Sher
lock Holmes had a considerable share
In clearing' the matter up, I feel that
no memoir of him would be complete
without tome little sketch of this re
markable episode.
It was a few weeks before my own
marriage, during the days -when I was
still sharing rooms with Sherlock
Holme* in Baker street, that he came
home from an afternoon stroll to find
s. letter on the table waiting for him.
I had remained Indoors all day. for the
weather Had taken a sudden turn to
rain, with high autumnal winds, and
the Jeza.il bullet which I had brought
back in one of my limbs as a relic of
jg? Afghan campaign throbbed with dull
Je.-sistency. With my body in one
ccsy-chair and my legs upon another,
I had surrounded myself with a cloud
of newspapers, until at last, saturated
with the news of the day, I tossed them
ail aside and lay listless, watching the
iiuge crest and monogram upon the en
velope upon the table, and wondering
lazily who my friend's noble corre
\u25a0pondettt could be.
"Here is a very fashionable epistle,"
I remarked, as he entered. "Your
morning letters, if I remember right,
were from a lish-monser and a tide
waiter." ; V:'"
"Yes, my correspondence has certain
ly the charm of variety," he answered,
smilitif, "and tiie humbler are usually
the more interesting. This looks like
one ct th'-se unwelcome" social sura
iiiunscs vphich caii upop a man either to
b<* boreii or tc lie." ' _
He br wte ' the " seal^ andâ* glanced "" over
the contents.
"Oh, come, it may prove to be some
thing of interest, afttr all." â¢ ,
"Kot social; then?"
"Ko, distinctly professional." .
"And from a noble client?"
"One of the highest In England.**
"My dear fellow, I congratulate yâ \u25a0
"I assure you, Watson, without affec
tation, that the status of my client is a
mutter of less moment to me than the
Interest of his case. It is just possible,
howevy, that that also may not be
\u25a0Â»\u25a0\u25a0 anting In this new investigation. You
*^Â«-vÂ« been reading the papers diligently
' oi late, have you not?"
"It looks like it," said I, ruefully,
pointing to a huge bundle in the corner.
"I have had nothing else to do."
"It Is fortunate, for you will perhaps
bt ablt to post me up. I read nothing
except the criminal news and the agony
column. The latter Is always instruc
tive. Bat If you have followed recent
events so closely you must have read
about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?"
"Oh, yea, with the deepest interest." .
That Is welL The letter which I hold
In my hand iÂ« from Lord St, Simon, I
'Will read It to you, and In return you
most turn over these papers and let me
have whatever bears upon thÂ« matter.
This Is what he says:
'"My Dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes â
Lord Backwater tells me that I may
place explicit reliance upon your judg
ment and discretion. I have deter
mined therefore td call upon you and
to consult you In reference to the very
painful event which has occurred in
connection with my wedding. Mr.
Lestrade of Scotland Yard is acting al
ready in the matter, but he assures me
that he sees no objection to your co
operation, and that he even thinks that
it night be of some assistance. I will
call at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and
should you have any other engagement
at* that time, I hope that you will post
pone it, as this matter is of paramount
importance. Yours faithfully,
- ST. SIMON/ .

written with a quill pen, and the noble
lord has had the misfortune to get a
smear of ink upon the outer side of his
right little finger," remarked Holmes,
&s he folded up the epistle.
"He says 4 o'clock. It is 3 now. He
â¢will be here in an hour." .
"Then I have Just time, with your
assistance, to get clear upon the sub
ject. Turn over those papers and ar
range the extracts in their order of
time, while I take a glance as to who
our client is." He picked a red -covered
volume from a line of books of refer
ence beside the mantel piece. "Here it
is," said he, sitting down and' flatten
ing- it upon his knee. "Lord Robert

Holmes, stretching his "long," thin' legs I
toward the fire.-* : > ':\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0â¢ '. - \â¢.

"A fair. dowry. -Not more than Is usual
In my family." \. '
"And this, of course, remains to you,
since the marriage is a fait accompli?"
"I really have, made no Inquiries on the
subject."
"Very naturally not. Did you see- Miss
Doran on the day before the wedding?"
"Yes."

we should do in our. future lives." "

until after . the ceremony/
"And did you observe any change in
her then "
"Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the
first signs that I had ever seen that her
temper wa3 Just a littlo sharp. The inci
dent, however, was too trivial to relate
and can have no possible bearing upon
the case."
-*'Pray let us have it, for all that."
- "Oh, It is childish. She dropped her
bouquet as we went toward the vestry.
She was passing the front pew at the
time, and it f.ell over Into the pew. There
\ was a~ moment's delay, but the gentle
man in the pew handed It up to her agaiu,
and it did not appear to be the worse for
the fall. Yet tPhen I spoke to her of the .
matter she answered me abruptly, and
J in . the , carriage. . on our way home, she
seemed absurdly agitated over thij
trifling cause."
"Indeed! You say that there was a
gentleman in the pew. Some of the gen
eral-public were present, then?"
"Ob, yes. It is impossible to exclude
them when the church is open."
"This gentleman was not one of your
wife's friends r*. '.
"No, no; I call him a gentleman by cour
tesy, but he v.as quite a common-looking
person. I hardly noticed his appearance.
But really I think that we are wander-
Ing rather far from the point."
"Lady St. Simon, then, returned from "
the wedding in a less cheerful frame of
mind than she had gone to It. What did .
she do on re-entering her father's hou3e?"
"I saw her in conversation with her
maid." -
: "And who la her maid?"
"Alice is \ her name. She is an Ameri
can, and came from California with her."
."A confidential servant?"
"A little too much so. It seemed to me
that : her mistress allowed her to * tak&
- great liberties. Still,- of course, in Amer
ica they look upon these things in a dif
ferent "way.'" '"
" "How long did she speak to. this Alice?"
"Oh, a -few minutes. I had something
else to think of." ;
."â¢'. "You did not overhear what they said?"
â¢ ."Lady! St. Simon said something about
â¢jumping 'a claim.* â¢ She was accustomed
to use slang, of. the kind.. I have no Idea
what sne meant." BSSHMfi -.

"Quite so. And she was afterward seen
walking: into Hyde Park in company with
l'lcra Millar, a woman who is now in
custody, and who had already made a
disturbance at Mr. Doran's house that
morning." .
"Ah. y<s. I should like a few particu
lars as to this young lady and your re
lations to her."
Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders
and raised his eyebrows. "We have been
on a friendly fooling for some yearsâ

"Did your wife hear all this?"
"No. thank goodness, she did not,"
"And she was seen walking with' this
very woman afterward?"
"Yce. That is what Mr. Lestrade of
Scotiand Yard looks upon as bo Eerlous.
It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife
out and laid some terrible trap for her."
â¢'WeJl, it is a possible supposition."
"You think so, too?"
"1 did not say a probable one. But you
Â«lo not yourself look upon this as
likely?"
"1 do not think Flora would hurt a
fly."
"Still, jealousy is a strange transformer
of character. Pray what Is your own
theory as to what took place?"
"Well, really, I came to seek a theory,
not to propound one. I have given you
all the facts. Since you ask me, however,
I may say that It has occurred to me as
i>ossible that the excitement of this af
fair, the consciousness that she had made
co immense a social stride, had the effect
of causing some little nervous disturb
ance in my wife."
"In short, that she had become suddenly
deranged?
"W^ll, re-aJly, when 1 consider that she
has turned her backâ l will not say upon
m*, but upon so much that many have
aspired to without successâ l can hardly
explain It in any otner fashion."
"Well, certainly that is also a conceiv
able hypothesis." said Holmes, smiling.
"And now, Lord St Simon. I think that
I have nearly all my data. May I ask
whether you were seated at the break
fast table so that you could see out
of the window?"
"We could see the other side of the
road and the park."
"Quite so. Then I do not think that I
need to detain you longer. I shall com
municate /with you."
"Should you be fortunate enough to
solve this problem." said our client, ris
ing:.
"I have solved it."
"Eh? What was that?"
"I say that I have solved it."
"Where, then. Is my wife?"
"That :e a detail which I shall speed
ily supply." â¢-, * ;.
Lord St. Simon shook his head. - "I am
afaid that it will, take wiser heads than
yours or .mine." he .remarked, and, bow
ing In a stately, old-fashioned manner.
he departed.
"It Is very good of Lord St. Simon to
honor my head by putting It, on a level
with his own," said Holmes, laughing. '"l
think that I shall have a whisky and
soda, and a cigar after all this cross
questioning. I had formed my conclu
sions as to the case before, our client
came- Into the room."
"My de*r Holmes!"
"I have of several similar cases,
though none, as I remarked before, which
were quite as prompt. My whole exam
ination served to turn my conjecture Into
a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is
occasionally very convincing, as when ysu
find a trout in the milk, to quote Tho

*Â»Â»â¢'. jr ANUAL training is simply the
/A /J training of the hands. Of all
I V I wondertul things on earth the
I hand is surpassing and superla
â¢^ tlve In beauty and capability.
Look at it. Four fingers and a thumb, an
open palm; what other instrument is
there so pliant, so flexible, so obedient to
Its owner's will?
Then, girls, as if one hand were not
enough, each of us has two. To tell the
truth, we do not make half the use we
ought of the poor left hand, which is
treated like an orphan child whose edu
cation is neglected, while everything is
lavished on the much prized right hand.
The fact is we all ought to be able to use
both hands impartially,, to be as deft and
clever in the use of the left hand as In
that of the right.
One sign of a good brain Is a sure, safe
and accurate method of using the hands.
You may fancy that It is very Important
for you to learn a good deal of science,
ever so much history, and ever so much
arithmetic. But, after all, it is just as
important that you should know how to
do things well, swiftly, thoroughly and
easily with the hands. You don't want
to be awkward and clumsy In using fin
sera and tbumb. People who are skillful
in the use of their hands are very seldom
larking in efficiency in other things.
Every girl used to be taught to do plain
needlework beautifully by hand. Before
the days of sewing machines ! no young
"But I have heard all that you have
heard."
"Without, howev-er. the knowledge of
pre-existing cases which serves me so
well. There was a parallel instance in
Aberdeen some years back, and something
on very much the Bame lines at Munich'
the year after the Franco- Prussian war.
It is one of these casesâ but, hello, .her*;
is Lestrade! Good afternoon, Lostrade!
You will find an extra tumbler upon tha
sideboard, and there are cigars in the
box;" ' ;
The official detective was -attired in a
pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a
decidedly . nautical appearance, and he
carried a black canvas bag in 'his 'hand.
With a short greeting he seated, himselt
and lit the cigar which had been oftercJ
to him.
"What's up, then?" ; asked Holmes, with
a twinkle in his eye.' "You look dissat
isfied." â¢
"And I feÂ«l dissatisfied. It is .this in
fernal St. Simon marriage case. "... I can
make neither head nor tail of the busi
ness."
"Really: You surprise me."
"Who ever hfard of such a mixed af
fair? Every clew seems to slip thx^ugh
my fingers. I have -been at w"ork upon
it, all day."
"And very wet it seems to have made
you," said Holmes, laying his hand upon
the arm of the pea-jacket. .
"Yes, I. "have been dragging the Ser
pentine," - . â¢ \u25a0
"In heaven' 3 name, what for?" "
"In search of the body of_ Lady St.
Simon." . ....
Sherlock Holmes leaned back In his
chair and laughed heartily.
"Have you dragged the basin of Trafal
gar Square fountain?".- he asked. â¢
"Why, what do you mean?"
"Because you have just as good a
chance of finding this lady in the one as
in the other."
LejJtrade shot an angry glance at my
companion. .
. "1. supposf; you know all about it," he
snarled.
"We 11, .1 have only just heard. the facts,
but my mind is made up."
"Oh, indeed! Then you think that the
Serpentine plays no part in the matter?"
"I think it very unlikely." , ,; '
"Then perhaps you will kindly explain
how it is that we found this- in It?"
He opened hie bag as he spoke and tum
bled on the floor a wedding dress _ of
watered silk, a pair of. white satin -shoes
and a bride's wreath and veil, all/dts
colored and soaked In water. "There,"
said he, putting a new wedding ring upon
the top of the pile. "ThÂ«re, is a little nut
for you to crack, Master Holmes."
"Oh, Indeed!" said my friend, ' blowing
blue rings into the air. "You dragged
them from the Serpentine?" .
"No. They were found floating,near the
margin by a park-keeper. They . have
been identified as h^r clothes, and It seem
ed to me that if the clothes were there
the body would not be far off."
"By the same brilliant reasoning, every
man's body Is to be found in .the neigh
borhood of his wardrobe. And pray
what did. you hope to arrive at through
this?"
"At some evidence implicating Flora
Millar in the disappearance." â¢ .
"I am afraid that you will find' it diffi
cult."
"Are you, indeed, now?" cried Lestrade,
with some bitterness. "I am afraid.
Holmes, that you are not very, practical
with your deductionsand your Inferences.
You have made two blunders in as many
minutes. Tills dress does implicate Miss
Flora Millar.", \u25a0-; v ; .;. ; ' , ;- -
"And how?". : \, â¢ ' .-y\ :â¢' \ ,' '
. "In the dress is a pocket.- In the pocket
is a card case.: In the;card.case is a note.
And here Is the very note." He slapped
It down iupon the table in* front^of^binu,
"Listen to this: .'lcm'.will see mfc when

Now my theory,, all;. along.; has .been 'that
Lady St. Simon -'.wiis' decoyed away â¢by

disappearance. Here, feigned with her in
itials, Is the very note i which was", no
doubt quietly slipped into her hand, at
the door and which lured her within their
reach." r â¢-.\u25a0'.
"Very goou. Lestrade," said Holmes,
laughing. "You really are very fine, in

paper in a listless way, but his attention
instantly became riveted, and he gave a
llttie cry of satisfaction. "This Is in-

well educated or. accomplished who did
not know how to make her own gar
ments with dainty neatness, who could
not darn stockings nicely, and who was
unskilled In the art of setting in a patch
and making old linen last after It had
begun to break here and there in thin
places. I think myself that to do plain
hand sewing with elegance Is a finer ac
complishment than to embroider beauti
fully.
Yet to be sure, embroidery is the poetry
of the needle. I have 6een In a home in
New Jersey some pieces of artistic m
broidery which arc fit to be handed down
as heirlooms, or to find a permanent place
in some museum of art. They are mar
vels of exquisite shading and coloring and
resemble the most beautiful specimens of
work with the brush. . :
I think I .hear Dorothy remarking to
Gladys that for her part she does not like
sewing and never did; that she has heard
her mother ray there Is no- economy In
making clothes at home, when they may
be bought at reasonable rates In the
shops, and that she for- one does not
mean to be coaxed and humbugged into
sitting down with a needle when: she
would much rather be doing something
else. \u25a0
Very well, Dorothy, you have the prlvi :
lege of candor, but Just listen to me, my
dear.
If any one of you girls is conscious of
a pronounced, decided and strenuous aver,
sion to the manual training which you can
get by learning the womanly art of sew
ing, then I advise you for your own sake
to conquer the aversion long enough. to
learn what you don't like.. I have said
this before In another, connection." I now
repeat that nothing is better for a girl in
the line of mental . discipline than reso
lutely to undertake and diligently to carry
through some undertaking which does not
much appeal to her. Every one \of us Is

some hill of difficulty and, seats herself

Holmes left me, but I had no time to be
lonely, for within an hour there arrived j
a confectioner's man with' a very large
flat box. This he unpacktd with the help I
of a youth whom he had brought with
lam, and presently, to my very great'as
tonishment,, a quite epicurean little cold
supper began to .be laid out upon our' j
humble lodging-house mahogany. There
were a couple of !brace of, cold woodcock,
a pheasant, a pate de foie^gras pie, with
akgroup of ancient and cobwebby bot
tles. Having laid out all these luxuries
my twp viÃitors -, vanished away, like the

Just before 0 o'clock Sherlock Holmes
stepped briskly Into the room. His fea
tures were gravely set, but there was a
light in his eye, which made me think that
he had not been disappointed in his con
clusions.- ,v -;. , . \u25a0
"They,. have laid the supper, then," he
said, rubbing his hands.
"You seem to expect company. They
have laid for five." .*
"Yes, I fancy we may have some com
pany dropping in," said he. "I am sur
prised that Lord St. Simon has not al
ready arrived. ;,Ha! â¢ I fancy that I hear
his step now upon. the stairs."
It was indeed our: visitor of the morn
ing who came bustling in, dangling his
glasses more vigorously than ever, and
with a very perturbed expression upon his
aristocratic features. ;
"My messenger reached you, then?"
asked Holmes.
"Yes, and I confess that the contents
startled me beyond measure. Have you
good authority for what you say?"
. {'The best â¢possible."

equipped tool chest is as valuable a pos
session to a girl as to. a' boy. As things
now are, thousands of young women after
they grow up? will have homes of their
own, in which they will live and reign in
quite contented splnsterhood.. Perhaps
you will be : stenographers, artists or
newspaper '.women; by and by. living in
pleasant companionship with other women
like yourselves, without even a brother or
a cousin to help you along. There are
times when a;maa In the house Is a great
comfort, but if there should not be a con
venient masculine relative within call,, a
girl who' can use a hammer, a saw and a
screwdriver, whoÂ« can open boxes- that
come by express, and nail boxes up, who
can mend something that is broken \ and
do her own household tinkering without
outside aid,, will be a very independent

The manual 'training class is supposed
not so much to enable ybu-to do'marvel
ous things in school as to fit you for
taking good care of yourself in practical
ways later ion in life. I am disposed to
Include under the head of manual trairi-
Ing some things that most girls find. very,
pleasant. Why should not a schoolgirl
ibe â¢ taught to drive, to ride, to row and
to reef a sail? All the outdoor life in
which the hands play a part Is' better,
carried on by ~a young woman- whose
hands have been "trained than, by- one
who ' has given exclusive attention to her
mind and very little to. her body. '
If I were you I would care a good 'deal
about the beauty of the hands. They
should be well kept, but not so well kept
that their owners do ho useful work. For
instance, there Is washing the dishesâ a
homely task which is seldom properly
done except by a lady. Of co"urse, . you
and I -take pride in the possession ~i of
beautiful china. In a New England farm
house.that I know there are Intact, not. a
piece broken, a cup nicked, a platter chip
ped.Vor any damage done 'anywhere, ;two
gets, of ancestral - china, j The china- was
brought from i England ; in the "early days
of the .Massachusetts \u25a0 colony, , and it has
been handed down' from mother to 'daugh
ter, in an unbroken line 'ever since. ;.
"I will make no allowance. -. I am very
angry, Indeed, and I have been shameful
ly used." â¢ " â¢
"I ' think that I heard a ring," said
Holmes. "Yes, : there are steps on the
landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a
lenient ; view j of ,: the â¢ matter,- Lord \u25a0 St.- Si r
mon,;l have- brought -an < advocate -here
who may be more successful." He opened
the door and ushered In a : lady and gentle
man.:! "Lord St.. Simon," said he, ."allow
me to introduce ' you to Mr. and Mrs.
Francis Hay- Moulton. The lady, I, think,
you have already met." * ' '- ;
At the : Bight ; of these newcomers .our
client had sprung from his seat and stood
very, erect, with his eyes ;cast- down and
his hand thrust Into the breast x 'of _'; his
frock coat, a picture of offended dignity.
The lady had taken a quick "step forward
and had held: out her hand to him, but
he still refused to raise his eyes. It was
as well for ".his resolution, perhaps, for
her pleading face was one which it was
hard to resist.
"You're angry, Robert," said she/ "Well,
I guess you have every cause to be."
"!Pray make no apology to me,", said
Lord St. Simon, .bitterly, v \
"Oh, yes, I know that*! have treated
you real bad and that I should^ have spo-'
ken to you before I went; but I was kind
of rattled, and from the i time ' when Jj I
saw Frank here again I' just didn't know
what I was doing or saying. I only won
der I .didn't fall " down - and faint right
there before the altar.'* â¢ ~
"Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like
my friend and me to leave the room while
you explain this matter?" \u25a0
"If I may give an opinion," remarked
the strange ;seutleman, "we've had just
a little too much secrecy -over this mat
ter already. For my part, I should like
all Europe and America to hear the rights
of -it."., He was a small, wiry, sunburnt
man,- clean shaven, .with a sharp face and
alert manner. â¢* â¢
"Then I'll tell our story right away,
said theflady. here and *I met in
'84 in McGuire's 1 camp, near the Rockies,
where pa was .working a claim. We were
engaged to each other, Frank and I; but
then one day -father struck a rich pocket
and made a pile, while poor Frank' here
had a claim that petered out and came to
nothing. The richer pa grew, the poorer
was Frank; so at last, pa wouldn't hear
of our engagement lasting any longer,
and he took me away to Frisco. Frank
wouldn't throw up his hand, though; so
he followed me there, and he saw me with
out pa knowing anything about It. It
would only have made hinumad to know,
so we just fixed it up for ourselves.
Frank said that he would go and make
his pile, too, and never come back to
claim me until he had as much as pa.
So then I promised to wait for him to the
end of time and pledged "myself not to
marry any one else while he lived, 'Why
shouldn't we be married right away,
then,' said he, 'and then I will feel sure
of you, and I won't claim to be your
husband until I come back?' Well, we'
talked It 'over, and he had fixed It all
up so nicely with a clergyman all ready
in waiting-, that we just did it right
there; and then Frank wentoff to seek
his fortune, and I went back to pa.
"The next I heard of Frank was that he
was in Montana, and then he went pros
pecting in xirizoiia, 3 and then I heard of
him from New Mexico. ; After that came
a long newspaper story about \u25a0 how a
miners' camp had been "attacked by
Apache Indians, and there was my
Frank's name among the killed. I faint
ed dead away, and I was very sick for
months -after. Pa thought I had a de
cline, and took me to half the doctors in
Frisco.- Not a word of news carno for a
year : or more, so' that I never doubted \u25a0
tha- Frank was really .dead. Then Lord
St. Simon came to Frisco, and we came
to London 1 , and a marriage was arranged,,
and- pa was very pleased, but I felt all
the ;time that \ no . man on this earth
would ever take the place in my -heart
that had been given to my poor Frank.
"Still, if I had married Lord St. Si
mon, of course I'd have to do . my duty
by him. We can't command our love,
but we can our actions. I went to the
altar with him with the intention to make
him just as good a wife asjt was in. me
to be. But you may imagine what I felt
when, just as I came to the altar rails,
I glanced back, and 'saw Frank standing
and looking at me out of the first pew.
I thought It was his ghost at first; but
when I looked ! again there he was still,

>â¢ I -pose we shall agree that it. is
one which is white and dimpled,
tvith rosy; finger tips, nice . nails and
small joints.' Large, obtrusive knuckles,
hands that are too thick and pudgy, or
too jthln and scrawny- to be sym
metrical,^ are not precisely beautiful.
But so far. as the size and shape of our
hands are concerned, we have to take
them as they come. We are born with
the hands of our ancestry, but the care
3f the ; hands is our own, and has far
nore- to do with keeping them beauti

show character almost as unerringly
ye our " faces do, and ; I think the man
ner of uaing them and the general neat
ness or* slovenliness which their own
ers impose upon them are apt to be
revelations of the inward life.

[had given him up for dead and had

had come upon me at last on the very

"I. saw it In a, paper," explained the
American. "It gave the name and the

and. never see any of them againâ just
sending a line to pa, perhaps, to show
him Chat I was alive.' It was awful to
me 'to think of all those lords and ladies
sitting round that breakfast - table and
waiting for me to come back. 'So Frank
took my wedding clothes and things and
made a bundle of them, so that I should
not be traced, and dropped them away
somewhere where no one could find them.
It is likely that we should have gone on
to Paris to-morrow, only that this good
gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came - rqund to
us this* evening, though how he found
us is more than I can think, and he show
nd us very clearly and kindly that I was
wrong and that Frank was right, and
that we should be putting ourselves in the
wrong. If we were so secret. Then he
affered to give us a chance of talking to
Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came
right away round to his rooms at once.
Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and
I am very sorry if I have given you
pain, and I hope that you do not think
very meanly of me." ... â¢ ' .-
Lord St. Simon had by no means re
laxed his rigid attitude, but had listened
with a frowning brow . and a com
pressed lip to this long narrative.
"Excuse me," he said, "but it is not
my custom to discuss my most intimate
personal affairs In this public manner." .
"Then â¢ you won't forgive me? .You
won't shake hands before I go?"
"Oh, certainly, If It would give you any
pleasure." He put out his hand and
coldly grasped that which she extended
tchhlm. 'i 'M ~ ' â¢ " It*
ii'l had hoped," suggested' Holmes, "that
you would have joined us in a friendly
supper.'' i
7 "I think that there. you ask a- little too
much," responded his Lordship. "I may
be forced to acquiesce In these recent de
velopments, but I can hardly be expected
to make merry. over them. I think that,
with your permission, I will now wish
you all a very good-night.',' He included
us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out
of the room.
"Then I trust that you at least will
honor me with your company," said Sher
lock Holmes. "It Is always a joy to
meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for I
friend without possessing. herself of. the
friend's hand, squeezing it and fondling
it as qne strokes a kitten, and near
Luoy sits Fannie, with a. yet more ob-.
lectlonable habit of handling every
thing she sees; objects of art, curios,
fans or other delicate things in other
people's houses, or in the shops, articles
meant to'be looked at, but not intended j
to be touched. Fannle's way Is sureto
render her persona non grata wherever
she goes.
George Eliot, describing Dorothea in
Mlddlemarch, says: "Her hand and
wrist were, so finely formed . that she
could wear sleeves not less bare of style
than those in which the blessed virgin
appeared to Italian painters."
If you look at some favorite picture of
the Madonna by Raphael s'pu wiir see
the sort of hand that Dorothea had. Such
hands can lie peacefully crossed in one's
iap, or, if busy with the pen or needle,
they still retain their feeling of calmness.
"It was all very well for Dorothea, to
have had those statuesque hands." ex
claims Marjorie, "but Just fancy j that
she had been in my case, and had dishes
to wash, beds to make and sometimes
pieces to Iron. Although I, am a school
girl, I .have to help my mother with the
housework, and kitchen work spoils a
pretty hand." I am aware that many
girls think just as Marjorie does about
this. I have even known girls who shirk
ed household tasks; and allowed ' tired
mothers to grow more tired instead . of
trying to ease their burdens, simply be
cauFe they feared to ruin hands of which
they were vain. You would never do
this, I am sure, you girls who are read
ing this talk. "*
While I_ am about It, let me caution
you not to wear dress gloves too small
for ; you, or that fit too tightly. Instead
of making your hand look smaller, tight
gloves exaggerate Its size. Gloves should

-The case has been an interesting one.
r remarked Holmes, when our visitors had
left us, '.'because it serves to show ver>
clearly how simple the explanation may
be of anaffalr which at first sight seems
to be almost Inexplicable. Nothing could
be more natural than the sequence ot
events as narrated by thia lady, and
nothing 'stranger than the result when
viewed, for Instance, by Mr. Lestrade.
of "Scotland- Yard." ; ; \u25a0
"You were not yourself at fault at all.
then?" ' *' w'
"From the first, two facts were very ob
vious to me, the one that the lady had
been quite willing to undergo the wed
dlrig ceremony, the other that she had
repented. of it within a few minutes of
returning home. Obviously something had
occurred during the morning, then, to
cause- her to change her mind. What
could that something be? She could not
have spoken to any one when she wa3
out. ; for she had been in the company of
the bridegroom. Had she seen some one,
then? If she had. It must be some one
from/Amerlca, because she had spent so.
short a time in this country that she
could hardly have allowed any one to ac
quire so deep an Influence over her that
the mere; sight of him would induce her to
change her plans so completely. You see
we have already arrived, by a process of
exclusion, that she might have seen an
American. ,' Then who could this Ameri
can be, and why should he possess" so
much influence over her? It might be a
lover: it might be a husband. Her young
womanhood had, I knew, been spent In
rough scenes and under strange condi
tions. So far I had got .before I ever
heard Ldrd St. Simon's narrative. When
he told us of* a man in a pew, of the
change iv the bride's manner, of so trans
parent a', device for obtaining a note as
the dropping of a bouquet, of. her resort
to her confidential maid, and of her very
significant allusion to claim jumpingâ
which, in miners' parlance means taking
possession, of that which another "person
has a prior claim toâ the whole situation
became absolutely clear. She had- gone
off with a" man, and the man was either
a lover or was a previous husbandâ the
chances being In favor of the latter."
"And -how In the world did you find
them?" _,
"It might have been difficult, but friend
Lestrade held information In his hands
the value of which he did not himself
know; The initials were of course, of the
highest importance, but more valuable
still was'it to know that within a week
he had settled hl3 bill at one of the
most select London hotels."
: "How did you deduce the select?"
"By the select prices.- Eight shillings
for a bed and eightpence for a glass of
sherry pointed to one .of the most ex
pensive hotels. There are not many in
London which charge at that rate. In
the' second^ one which I visited In North
umberland avenue, I learned by an In
spection of the book .that FÂ»ancls H.
Moulton, an American gentleman, had left
only the day before, and on looking over
the entries- against him I came upon the
very items which; I had seen In the du
plicate bill. His letters were to be foi
warded to No. 226 Gordon square; so
thither I traveled, and \u25a0 being fortunate
enough to find the loving couple at home,
I ventured to give them some paternal ad
vice, and to point out to . them that it
would be better In every. way that they
should make their position a little clearer
both to the general public and to Lbrd
St. Simon, in particular. I Invited thtna
to meet , him. here, and, as . yoo see, I
made him keep the appointment." .
"But with no very good result." I re
marked. "His conduct was certainly not
very gracious."; ; . ...
"Ah, Watson," said Holmes, , smiling,
"perhaps you would 1 not be very gracious
either if, after all the trouble of wooing
and wedding, you found yourself deprived
in an instant of wife and of fortune. I
think that we may judge i_ord St. Simon
very mercifully, and thank- our stars
.that we are never likely to find ourselves
in the same position. Draw your chair
up and 'hand me my violin, for the only
problem we have still to solve Is how to
while away these bleak, . autumnal even
ings."
where girls receive demerits If they go
out \o walk or make calls without put
ting on their gloves first.
Every young girl should have on . her
dressing table a manicure set. This, con
sists of a small pair of curved scissors,
a nail file, an orange stick, a chamois
polisher and a little box of nail powder.
When about to trim the nails soften them
by dipping the ends of the fingers Into
warm soapy water. File the nails, first,
gently press back the , cuticle with an
orange stick, rub them with a little
vaseline and polish . the nails with
chamois. A girl who neglects cleanliness
in the daily toilet of the hands and nails
Is either indifferent to bathing and â¢to
the proper care of the body, or else her
early surroundings have been unfortu
nate. Observe girls, that a lady's. hands
may be rough and red, but they are In
variably immaculate. Clean hands are
the hall-mark of a gentlewoman;
I must add a word, too. about the cor
dial hand-clasp. Some girls have a limp.
flabby way of shaking hands. They really
have no grip. Others go to the opposite
extreme, and almost crush a friend's
hand when they grasp It. There Is a
happy medium in this, as In most things.
When you. meet a friend In the street or
at your home, it is very seldom necessary
to greet her with a kiss. Almost, never
should one girl kiss another in a public
place. The only exception is when
friends are separating. for a long time or
for a Journey, such as crossing the At
lantic or the continent. Then kisses are
in order. Usually, it is enough to shake
hands when one encounters friends or ac
quaintances, and the hand-clasp should
be warm and sincere. â¢ - -.
Do not rush to fada in hand-shaking.
Several years ago there was a" fashion
of elevating a friend's hand in a rather
abrupt perpendicular way. which had* an
extremely. awkward effect. That style Is
now obsolete. In your, own home do not
greet visitors with a' mere stiff bow.
Offer your hand. You have, o" course,
the privilege of refusing to shake hands
with a person you dislike, or with one
of whom you do not approve.
"The hand of. Douglas Is his own.". but
one can hardly offer a greater slight than
to refuse or overlook a proffered hand.FASHINABLE GOWNS

AUGUSTA PRESCOTT.
THE D-ichesÂ» of llarlborough,
dressed In a shirt waist suit, sat
upon the terrace of the Cafe Rue
de la. J'ais:. drinking: boer. So tho
dispatches said. But the truth Is
that the Dute drank the beer. while
tho Duehecfl sipped tea. ThÂ« pair were
eot holidaying and seemed ridiculously
happy and remarkably well costumed.
The Duchess, from time to time, pat
ted the ekirt of her shirt waist suit,
which m of light-weight taffeta,
which blew In the breeze. And more
than once she t-traightened the little
fenther toque which she had donned for
fall. That the pair were smartly
dressed there would have been no Ques
tion, even had they not been sketched
by a fashion artist, who was on deck,
for a Kronen paper. â¢
The shirt waist suit of the Duchess
was made of watermelon green taffeta
and the skirt was "built" â as the
French say â on accordeou lines. Noth
ing could have been snugger at the hips
than the plaits, which were stitched flat
fully three fingers deep. And then
came tlie accordeon-llke flare.
The waist was on the shirt waist
order. 6tltched flat as to the yoke, with
a handsome flare across the bust. There
were buttons of blue enamel and the
dearest little shoulderette of soft blua
woolly Staff, one of the sort which you
can weave upon the little modern looms
\u25a0which some for the purpose. Then
there was a. bij; soft muff of the same
oiaterlal.
All of the new skirts are not ac
cordecm plaited, but a great majority of
them are built in this manntr, for the
popularity of the modified a.ccordeon
plaite<l dress is great. But one docÂ«
vow ar.d tl.on tt-e a gown built on other
lines, and it is with these dresses that
the fashion writer has to dual, because
they sire newer.
While in I'aris the Duke and th*
Dui'liess went bhopping a great deal
and usually upon the popular streets,
and here tlu-y picked up many a hand
some p'ov.n. The Duchess, who docs
not boMeye iv preserving: her \u25a0wardrobe,
but who i -urchiises new jowns in order
thut slit may wear them, was teen one
Â«ia> in a wry pretty smooth serge sown
In deep plu::i. It was called a "cab
govvi;." \u25a0
>Mu>( Have a Cab (ionn.
A cab town, by the way. is one that
!s. for ha i k wear. It is made of Â»oraÂ«
light-weight, serviceable stuff like
serge and it is built upon thÂ« most use
ful lines. It is good, whether one goes
in a cab or not. for it is a. utility dress.
One very becoming hack gown worn
by the Dnclieis â a. gown which any
woman rn!sht copy â was la a very
pretty Scottish troods In a shade of
walnut brows. It was made with a
plaited skirt, but thf. plaits were in
' verted and stitched almost all the way
to the* held. The effect was very much
like a killed skirt. The waist had threo
box plaits front and back and sug
gested in manj ways a Norfolk Jacket,
t>a.vÂ«s that it wils fitted and needed no
belt. Around her waist the Duchess
worÂ«! p- bid silver chain, to which wm
attached a shopping bag and many
chatelaine ornaments.
It is rather umart these days to have
a handsome shopping shirt waist built
of black material. If you can succeed
In making up a black cloth waist so
that it looks dresay you will have ac
complished much. â¢ The French dress
makers are making a. specialty of thesa
â¢waists and are finishing them in pretty
ways *o that tl:ey can be worn ir. the
Btreet. Made of heavy novelty tloth.
embroidered or braided, and worn with
v handsome fur or feather boa. they are
Indeed beautiful if one can manage to
make them sn.urt'ln style.
The blouse shirt waists are handsome
and tLe blouse pattern Is really the
most to be r^-ommended, because It id
most easiiy Jilted. Such a waist, nicely
made end worn- in the street on cold
days. cÂ«irrios with it a. wonderful air
of smartness, tven though ii be nothing
but a cloth shirt waist after ull.
v It would be. simply impossible to be
gin to tell all the shirt waist models of
the year. The fall has brought in hun
dreds of new ones and you cannot look
Ã¼bout without seeing something which
haÂ» never been seen before. "How
majjy new &hirt waists can be counted
In the stores this year?" asked tome
one of a modiste whose specialty Is the
made to order shirt waist.
"I have counted a thousand new
modela," replied she, "and 1 am con
tinually seeing new ones. They must
run up into the tt-na of thousands.
Each, little sliouider ornament, each lit
tle cape, eucii double fold, each broad
ening of the shoulder and each modifi
cation of the sleeves suggests some
thing new and out of the ordinary."
One of (be Popular Model*.
The new waists nbow this form,
and tl re are certain designs which
ere noticeable, among which may be
mentioned the waist which is made
with three overlapping folds. These
folds arc wide enough to take the place
of ruffles. The waist is composed of
three of , these, which extend from the
bust to the belt.
Mrs. Payne Whitney, who was Helen
Hay. the poet sister of the Hay family,
wore on her" arrival from Europe a
handsome French suit which attracted
Lie attention of all who saw It. The
length was slightly. more than walking
Uength ana the material was a heavy
Fren.-h Henrietta: The skirt had its
little stilohcd plaits around the hips,
whi. the foct had three deep tucks.
The waist was \u25a0 tucked across the bust,
three wide tucks falling nearly to the
wide dull silk girdle. The model could
be copied in deep brown for the woman
who wants a handsome reception dress
for fall.
All dresses are so pretty these days
that it is almost impossible to desig
nate them. It is very difficult to say:
"This is an Â». very-day gown and that
is a reception dress." And when it
comes to the distinction between call
ing and dinner gowns the line is .still
harder to draw. All are so boautiful
that one can scarcely distinguish one
from the, other.
"I wear my gowns as I choose, regard
less of cost," said a woman, "and I am al
ways well dressed. Theft are all handsome
gowns. And I, myself, can hardly tell
the dtessy from the cheap ones. It all
depends upon the way Th which they are
made. And I lay *Jown a law that none
of my dresses shall be shoddily construct
ed."
It is a fact that all dn -~os are pretty
t- s year. AH se< . made with a high
regiird for vtyle and there is hardly such
a thing as a dowdy dress to be seen.
Even the liitle wool novelties selling for
a fchillin;? a yard are made up into much
smartness.
Pick Your Material Tastefully.
A very handsome little brown novelty
goods, looking something like a Japanese
cloth, with its tiny red embroidered fig
ure, was made into an Eton suit with the
Eton built on the French lines, with a lit
tle shoulderette and a very smart inserted
vest. The trimmings -were in cherry taf
feta and there were. ' some wonderful
enamel buttons.
Buttons do a great deal to help out.
One pretty costume owed its success to its
buttons, which were large and handsome
ly worked. The covers, were worked be
fore the buttons were slipped upon the
molds and a little mock gem was sewn
in the center of each. There was a girdle
to match, with a great handsome buckle
wider than "your hand in front, all curved
to tit the waist. In the back there was a
great round medallion. This quite made
the suit.
Knowing vwomen of fashion are buying
the neat little feather toques^ These are
in white. In red," in blue and in black and
they are large in the head and big around,
very much like a polo turban. In fact the
feather toque of fall has succeeded the
polo turban of summer. It is large and
round, high, yet flat on top, and It 1b
made of the most beautiful feathers. Its
price runs up to all figures. But you can
get a pretty one for about S3. though the
really handsome feather turbans com
mand the price of $25. And well are the jr^
worth it, for they never wear out?! f 'given
ordinary care.
It was a very extravagant New tfork
woman who came out the other day in
a peacock blue cloth, trimmed around
the semi-skirt with a band of peacock
feathers. Her toque was trimmed with
peacock eyes and she carried an um
brella with a metal handle of peacock
feathers. It was striking, pretty and ex
pensive at the sarhd time.
While hats have Â»Â»ereai.ed In size there
are many little hats, and particularly
are there many little cloth hats. These
are rolled around in turban fashion and
.trimmed with feathers. It Is possible to
match the costume to any hat. And to
do- this means to be well dressed.
"Don't make your hat of your dress
material." said a milliner. "It Is fatal
to. style. Make it of * feathers or of silk,
or of some other material, felt or any
thing .you -please. But don't'make It off
a' piece of you,r ' gown. It will kill your
haU LÂ»et it' match in color, but don't
try to have it match in; material. That
la a rule to be followed always."

THE SAN FRANCISCO -SUNDAY . CALL
written by a fashionable American wom
an traveling abroad: v
"We arrived in ; Paris Monday, with a
dinner in prospect | and [ nothing to wear.
Our. trunks had been delayed, and' though
I had a silk skirt which would do, I was
positively without a waist. My old pongee
traveling blouse was impossibleT ; In my
quandary somebody whispered to me,
'Visit the ready-mad^e shops and buy a
shirt waist.' ,
"Directly after luncheon I hied, me to
the stores and here I found shirt-waists
in' bewildering array. '\ Such beauties,
such artistic . conceptions, such . marvel
ous adaptations of color and style, and
such bargains. For twelve good Ameri
can dollars I \u25a0 could get anything In the
world I wanted â or so it seemed
to ma.
"But I soon found my mistake; The
prices ran upward into a -good hundred
American* dollars, and one beauty cost
$300. But it was a waist which was
trimmed with topaz of bewildering glow.
It was quite too good to go with my plain
navy' di ae taffeta sun-plaited- skirt, so
I passed It" by.
"What I ' did . find* was. a wonderful
black silk mull Waist, a" perfect dream,
trimmed with strappi.: *s . oÂ» loose pink'
and navy blue; combined in a manner
that r .distinctly Parisian. Rose; pink
aiid navy blue ' ribbon were tied in
knots to'make a ladder down the front
of the waist and there- were beautiful
little bov/s upon "the elbow sleeves.;
Underlying the bows were little plat
ters of lace â I suppose you would call
them medallionsâ and upon each me
dallion there was a lot of embroidery,
with a deal of ribbon threaded through"
lace running all over the gown. .
"I bought the waist and found It just
the thing for, evening. 'Buy. a hip yoke
of lace threaded with ribbon,' -suggested
the charming saleswoman. And I
bought the yoke, attached it to my
skirt, and,. when I had added a pair of
shoes to J matcfa, I was complete; .
"My friend, who had a biscuit colored
cloth skirtâ and who was in the same
predicament as I regarding, a waist â
bought a lovely biscuit colored taffeta,
trimmed with ruffles and ruffles of chif
fon, each ruffle edgedwith valenclennes
lace
"The only note of coloring was a lllao
turquoise blue thread running through
the ruffles. And there were dozens of
little turqouisc buttons. They trimmed
the waist down the sleeves, across the
front, tipon the Â«tock and over the
shoulders. They were put on in groups
of five and they. were so little that you
could only see; them^gleam. Of cou"rse,
the girdle had a great;turquoise buckle,

tastic, elaborate and expensive.

shades. is both artistic and inexpensive,
and has the great . advantage : of being

caslon. This is a -positive advantage,
for the Oriental lamp ; shades, beautiful
as they are, are out of place in many
rooms whose furnishings have no -rich

There is more in the same strain, but
thlsis enough' to. show which way the
wind ! is blowing.
The new siiirt wal3t models have
many striking features which are not
only.tnotice.able but pretty. "I sigh for
the days ' of the old plain shirt waist,"
said a woman looking at the new mod
els. "The new shirt -waists are so elab
orate that they cost as much as a
whole gowrPshould cost."
"But," was the reply, "see. how much
prettier they are and in how many
ways they can be used. You can go to
a weddlmj In a ready-made shirt waist,
whereas v once you could hardly have
gone to a luncheon in one."
And this about described the situa
tion as far as the shirt. waist season of
the present year is concerned. The
new models are made in great variety
and there is no doubt that a good bod
ice, â¢ ready-made and ready to', be . put

every occasion which nay arise In the
life of a society 'wo:.".an.

sleeves swept with lace ruffles. Across
the shoulders there Is a double cape
effect of shell pink chiffon accordeon
plaited and put on so as to make the
Immensely broad shoulder effect.
The sleeves consist of three big crÂ«pÂ«
de chine chiffon puff 3. lined with crepW
de chine, with the puffs tied with pink
velvet ribbons. And there is a very
wide pink velvet girdle and a sash
with very wide ends that sweep thÂ»
skirt. Nothing now Is needed except a
plain white chiffon, mull, muslin or taf
feta skirt, such as every girl has la
her summer wardrobe. Thus In a few
hours the bridal party was fitted out.
Getting a Wardrobe Together.
There are women who, wishing to pos
sess large wardrobes, are arranging for
handsome dress skirts. They will buy or
have mada to order a dozen handsome
dress skfrti. and these, with the help of
a number of handsome shirt waists, will
constitute the wardrobe. And a very nlcÂ»
showing this arrangement will make.
"Tell me what skirts to get," asked a
woman of her modiste. "I find the shirt
waist and the ready-made bodice very
becoming to me. But I need a unmber of
handsome skirts."
The modiste hesitated. "Choose a va
riety and in all colors," said the modist*
pcomptly. "There is no other way to ar
range for a handsome wardrobe."
"I would suggest," said she. "a beauti
ful skirt of black mull embroidered in
pink roses. This would be made over a
chiffon lining, with a silk skirt under
neath. Have all the trimmings of pink.
This will do to wear with all your pink
bodices. 'V"
"Next have a handsome skirt of. blue
taffeta, trimmed with black flounces, and
have the. flounces embroidered in blua
flowers and vines, small but attractive.
Provide a wide blue velvet girdle, coming
high in the back. And see that you have
plenty of turquoise ornaments. This will
make a very lovely setting for your blue
waists, no matter what shade of blue.
"Have plenty of skirts." said the mo
diste. "This is quite necessary to remem
ber. Don't neglect to provide an abund
ance of skirts, both short and long, for
you cannot look nice if your skirt Is
dowdy." _
Advice which the home dressmaker
shauld heed
nected throughout the design by , their
stems, etc.. are very good. These all per
mit, of -many open spaces which can be
cut away, thus leaving the shade more
light i and open.
In all these instances the foundation
shade which shows through the open
spaces ia of the color of the design or
one that contrasts prettily with it. For
Instance, a design of green grapes on a
pale blown lattice would he made up on a
pale green or a white shade, an exquialta
design of cabbage roses In made up on
a pink shade or a green one. a design
of yellow iris is made up on a cream
color ' silk shade and â¢so on.
In , the case of women who cannot do
water color painting It Is quite possible
"to make thess'lamp shades of wall paper.
Floral designs, lattice designs and fruit,
designs have recently run riot In wall
paper, and It. will be no very difficult
matter to find one having the 'proper
pattern for a lamp shade. Care must bo
taken, however, not only to get an ap
propriate design but one as finely carried
out 'as possible, because since the design
must be cut out, perfection of detail is
necessary.
It is best to choose a design to which
a lot of branches, leaves, twigs, etc., de- -
â¢pend from the main blossom, as the effect
Is much prettier when a great many flna
temJrills,',etc, are cut out. It gives the
shade a softer effect and takes away from
the flatness of the stiff paper. ?THE PLUM TREE

1 SHALL, not retail the negotiations.
The u?t>hot was that I let the admin
istration drop the criminal cases
ssainst Roebuck in return for the
restoration of my power In the national
CGir.mittee of the party to the smal
leet ejected postmaster in the farth
est State. The civil action was pressed
by Ferguson â¢ will all his skill as a
lawyer end a popularity seeking politi
cian; and he won triumphantly In the
Supreme Courtâ the lower Federal court
<nith its Power Trust Judge had added
to his triumph by deciding against him.
Roebuck waÂ«, therefore, under the ne
cessity of going through the customary
forms or outward obedience to the Su
preme Court's order to him to dissolve-
He had to get at huge expense, and to
carry out at huger, a plan of organiza
tion.
Though he was glad enough to escape
thus lightly, he dissembled his content
and grumbled go loudly that Burbank's
fears were roused and arrangements
were made to placate him. The scheme
adopted was, I believe, suggested by
Vice President Howard, as shrewd and
cynical a rascal as ever lived In the
mire without getting smutch or eplash
upon his fine linen of respectability.
For several years there had been a
Ftrorijr popular demand for a revision of
the tariff. The party had promised to
yield, but had put off redeeming its
promise. Kow there arose a necessity
for revising the tariff In the Interest of
"the interests." Some of the schedules
vi ere 100 low; others protected articles
which the interests v.-anted as free raw
material? ; a few could be abolished with
out offending any large interests and
with the effect of punishing some small
ones that had beÂ«n niggard In contribut
ing to the "campaign fund" which maiji
lains the standing army of political work
ers and augments it whenever a battle
is on. Accordingly a revision of the tariff
waÂ« in progress. To soothe Roebuck, they
save him a tariff schedule that would
rr.a ble him to collect each year more
than the total of the extraordinary ex
penses to which I had put him. Roe
buck "forgave" me; and I really forgave
Burbank.
But I washed my hands of his admin
istration. Not only did I actually stand
aloof, but also J disassociated myself
from it in the public mind. When the
crash should come, as come it must with
such men at the helm, I wished to be
in a position successfully to take full
charge for the work of repair.
CHAPTER XXXII.
A (Vlance Behind the Mask of Grandenf.
Not until late in the spring of his Â»ec
on'J yÂ«ar did Burbank find a trace of gall
in ids wine.
From the night of his election parasites
and plunderers and agents of plunderers
had imprisoned him in the usual Presi
dential fool's paradise. The organs of the
interests and their Congressional hench
men praised everything he did; I and my
group of Congressmen and my newspa
pers, as loyal partisans, bent firet of all
upon regularity,- were silent where we did
not praise also. But the second year of
a President's nrst term is the beginning
of frank, if guarded, criticism of him
from his own side. For it is practically
his last year of venturing to exercise any
real official power. The selection of dele
gates to the party's national convention,
to which a President must submit him
self for leave to resubmit himself to the
people, is well under way before the- end
of his third year; and direct and active
preparations for it must begin long in ad
vance.
Late In that second spring Burbank
maiie a tour of the country, to give the
people the pleasure of seeing their great
man, to give himself the pleasure of their
admiration, and to help on the Congres
sional campaign, the result of which
would be the preliminary popular verdict
upon his administration. The thinness of
the crowds, the feebleness of the enthusi
eem. the newspaper sneers and flings at
that oratory once hailed as a model of
tflgnity and eloquenceâ even he could not
accept the smooth explanations of his
flatterers. And in November came the
party's memorable overwhelming defeat
reducing our majority in the Senate from
twenty to six, and substituting for our
majority of ninety-three in the House an
opposition majority of sixty-seven.
I talked with, him early In January and
was amazed that, while he appreciated
the public anger against the party, he
still believed himself personally popular.
"There Is a lull in prosperity," said
he, "and the people are peevish."
goon, however, by a sort of endosmosis
to which the densest vanity is some
what subject, the truth began to Â»eep
through and to penetrate into him.
He became friendlier to me, solicitous
toward spring 11 â but he clung none the
less tightly to jGoodrich. The full
awakening came in his third summer
when the press and the politicians of
the party began openly to discuss the
next year's nomination and to -speak of
him as if he were out of the running.
He was spending the hot months on
the Jersey coaet, the flatterers still
swarming about him and still aseidu
oui. but their flatteries falling upon
ever deafer ears as his mind riveted
upon the hair-suspended sword. In
early September he invited me to visit
him â ray first Invitation of that kind
in two year* and a half. We had three
interviews before lie could nerve him
self to brush aside the barriers be
tween him and me.
"I am abotlt to get together my
friends with a view to next year," said
he through an uneasy emile. "What
do you think of the prospects?" .;
"What <io your friends say?" I asked.
"Oh, of course, I am assured of v. re
nomination â " He paused and his look
at me made the confident affirmation a
dubious question.
" Yes," said 1.
"And â don't you think my record has
made me strong?" he went on nerv
ously.
"Strong â Y/ilh .whom ?" said I.
He was silent. Finally he laid his
lA*nd on my kneÂ« â v.c were taking the
nir on the ocean drive. "Harvey," he
snid, "I can count on you?" '
I shook my head. "I sliall.take.no
part In the m.-xt campaign," I said. "I
rhall rvsisn the chairmanship." \ -
"Uut. I bare Be'lectt-df you as my
chairman. I have insisted -on you. - I
can't trivet any one else. I no**d others,
I use others, but I trust only you."
I shook my head. "I shall resign,"
I repeated. "What's the matter â
won't Goodrich take the place?"
He looked away. "1 have not seri
ously thought of any one but you," he
said reproachfully.
I happened to know % that thft
place had been offered to Good
rich . and that he had declined it,
protesting that I, a Western man, must
not be disturbed when the West was
vltnl to the party's success. "My reso
lution is fixed," said I.' *
A long silence, then: "Sayler, have
you heard anything of an attempt to
defeat me for the nomination?"
"Goodrich hps decided to nominate
Governor Riugeway of Illinois," said I.
He blanched and had to moisten his
dry, wrinkled lips several times before,
he could speak. "A report of that na
ture reached me last Thursday," he
went on. "For some time I have been '.
perplexed by the Ridgeway talk In
many of our organs. I have questioned
Goodrich about it â and â I must sayâ .
his explanations are not â not wholly
satisfactory." \
1 glanced at him and had instantly
to glance away, so plainly was I show
ing my pity. He was not hiding him
self from me now. He looked old and
tired and Â»iek â not mere sickness <of
body, but that mortal sickness of the
mind and heart which kills a \u25a0 man,
often years before his body dies.
"I have come to the conclusion that
you .were right about Goodrich,. Sayler.
I am glad that I took your advice and
never trusted him. I think you and. I i
together will be too strong for him."
"You are going to seek a renomina
tlon?" I asked. , .-. . "
He looked at me in genuine astonish
ment. "It is impossible, that the party â¢
should refuse me." he said.
I was eilent. .
"Be frank with me, Sayler," -he ex
claimed at last. "Be frank. Be my
friend, your own old'self."
"As frank 'and as friendly as you
have been?" eaid I, rather to^ remind
myself than to reproach him. .-For I
was afraid of the. reviving feeling of
former years â the-liking for his per-
sonal charms and virtues, the forbear
ance toward, that weakness which he
could no more change than he could
change the color of hijs eyes. His moral
descent had put no clear markings
upon his poÂ»e. On the contrary, he had
grown in dignity through the custom
of deference. The people passing
us looked . admiration at him,
had a new sense of the eleva
tion of the Presidential -office.
Often it takes the trained and searching
eye to detect in the majestic facade the
evidences that the palace hag degener
ated into a rookery for pariahs.
"I have done what I thought for the
best," he answered, never more .direct
and manly In manner. - "I have always
been afraid, been on guard, lest my per
sonal fondness for you should betray me
into yielding to you when I ought not.
Perhaps I have erred at timÂ« 3, have
leaned backward in my anxiety to be
fair. But I had and have no fear of your
not understanding. Our friendship is too
long established, too well founded." Ami
I do not doubt that he believed himself;
the capacity for eelf-deception is rarely
short of the demands upon it. -
"It's unfortunate â " I began. I was
going to say it was unfortunate that no
such anxieties had ever restrained him
from yielding to Goodrich. But I* hadn't
the heart. Instead. I finished my sen
tence with: "However, It's idle to hold
a post-mortem on thlf case The cause
of death is unimportant. The fact of it
is sufficient. No doubt j r ou did the best
you could, Mr. President."
My manner was that of finality. It for
bade further discussion. He abandoned
the finesse of negotiation.
"Harvey, I ask you, as a. personal
favor, to help me through this crisis,"
he said. "I ask you, my friend and my
dead wife's friend."
No depth too low, no sentiment too
sacred! Anger whirled up in me against
this miserable, shortsighted self-seeker
who had brought to a climax of spolia
tion my ylana to guide th* strong in
developing the resources of the country.
And I turned upon him. Intending to
overwhelm him with the truth about his
treachery, about his attempts to destroy
me. For I- was now safe from his and
Goodrich's 'vengeance â they had destroyed'
themselves with the people and with the
party. But a glance at him andâ how
cpuld I Etrike a man stretched in agony
upon his deathbed? "If 1 could help you,
I would," said I.
"Youâ you' and I together can get a
convention that will nominate me," he
urged, hope and fear jostling each other
to look pleadingly at me from his
eycÃ.
â¢'Possibly," I said- "Butâ of what use
would that hp?" '
He sank back in the carriage, yellow
white and with tremblinp hands and eye
lids. "Then you don't think I could be
elected?"- he asked in a broken, breath
less way.
For ' answer I. could only shake my
head. "No matter who is tho nominee."
I went on after a moment, "our party
can't win." I half-yielded to the impulse
of sentimentality and turned to him ap-

pealingly. "James," said I, "why don't
youâ right awayâ before the country sees
you are to bo denied , a renominationâ
publicly announce that you won't take it
in any circumstances? Why don't you
devote the rest of your, term to regaining
your lostâ popularity? Every, day has its
throrrgs of opportunities for the man in'
the White House. Break ' boldly j and
openly with Goodrich and his crowd."
I saw. and read the change in his;face.
My advice about the nomination straight
way closed his mind against me. At the
mention of. Goodrich his old .notion of my
Jealousy revived. And 'l saw, too, ; that
contact" with and use of. and subservience
to corruption had so corrupted him, that
he no longer had any' faith in any,meth
od, not corrupt. All in' an instant^ l real-,
ized the full folly of what I was doing. 1

I had indicated ho could; so change fhe

would- make it impossible for them to re

ing that mingled admiration, envy and
awe which humanity gives its exalted
greats "The President! The President!"
I heard every "few yards in excited un
dertones. Andhats were lifting, and once
a, crowd of enthusiastic partisans raised
a cheer. '
"The President!" 'I ' thought, with
mournful irony. And I glanced at him.
Suddenly he was transformed by an ex
pression the \u25a0 most frightful I have ever
seen. 'It was the , look of a despairing,
weak, .vicious thing,' cornered, giving bat
tle 1 for its lifeâ like a fox at bay before a
pack of huge dogs*. It- was not Burbank
âno, he was wholly.- unlike that. It was
Burbank's ambition, ; interrupted at Its
meal by the relentless, sure-aiming j hun
ter, , Fate. *, ; .', .'. ' , .\u25a0\u25a0 ;. -. '
"For God's sake, Burbank!" I exclaim

t^llyou, Sayler. I will be nominated! And
elected, too.* by., God! I, will- , not ,be
thrown aside llke'an emptied orange skin.

Those words, ; said , by. some : men, in

The next seven months. were months of
turmoil in the party and in the countryâ
a turmoil of which I was a silent specta
tor, conspicuous by my silence. Burbank,
the deepest passions of his nature iam
pant, had burst -through the meshes, of
partisanship' and the meshes of social and
personal intimacies j in which he, as a
"gpod party man"' and as the father tt
children with social aspirations and es
the worshiper of wealth and respecta
bility, was" entangled; and bound down;
with the desperate courage that comes
from fear, of destruction he was trying to
save himself.
But . his only available instruments
were all either j Goodrich men or otner
kinds of .machine-men; they' owed
nothing to him. they . had noth
ing to fear ' from himâ a . fallfns
king',, is â¢ , &\u25a0'-. .fallen; king. \ Every
project ' he â¢. devised . "for . striking'
down hit traitor friends and making
himself popular was subtly turned by his
Cabinet, or: by. the' Senate, or by the
press, or. by. all :- three, into something'
futile and ridiculous or contemptible. It
was a demonstration of the
silliness of ,the fiction that the President
could "foe an. autocrat 'if he chosel g Even
had' Burbank seen through the fawnings
and; the flatteries i of the tr*.itoTs round
him arid dismisfle.d his Cabinet,'. whatever '
men he ; might put' into 'It would
not i have- attached ? themselves to his lost
cause,, but would have; used ." their post- ;
tions-to ingratiate; themselves with thi?
power; that, had used, and, exhausted and
discarded, him. ': ; V , *. "" v-;
He had the wisdom, or the timidity, to
proceed always with caution and safe
legality and so "to avoid Impeachment
and degradation. Ills chief attempts
were, naturally. . upon monopoly; they
were slyly balked by h!s sly Attorney
General, and their failure was tailed -by
the press and was. believed by the people,
the cause of the- hard- times which were
Just beginning to" be acute. What made
him such an easy victim to 'his lieuten
ants was not t their craft, , but ths fact
that he had lost his. sense of right and
wrong. A man -of affairs-m ay not. in
deed will not. always steer by that com-"
pass: but he mu3t have it aboard.' With
out it he can not know how far off
the course he Is, or how to get. back to
it. No ship- ever reached any port ex
cept that of failure' and disgrace, unless
It, in spite, of all its tackings before the
cross winds of practical life, kept in the
main to : the compass and to the course.
His -last stagger was-^or seemed to be
an attempt to involve us in a war with
Germany. I say "seemed to be" because
I 'hesitate,' to 'ascribe .a project as in
famous to "him. even, when unbalanced
by despair." The â¢ lirst ugly dispatch he
ordered his Goodrich Secretary of, State
to send, somehow leaked to the news- \
papers* before It could be put into cipher
for transmission. . It ' was npt . sentâ for
from the press of the. en tire country rose
a clamor against "deliberate provocation
of a- nation with which we are, and wish
to remain, at peace.". He repudiated the
dispatch and dismissed the Secretary of
State ,in disgrace to disgraceâ the
one stroke in his fight against
Goodrich in which he got the advant
age. But that advantage, was â¢ too
small, too doubtful- and too late.
His name was not presented to the
convention. '.-r
CHAPTER XXXin.
A "Spasm of Virtue."
I forced upon Goodrich my place as
chairman of the national committee
and went abroad with my daughters.
As s^on as the election was over our
people began to cable me to come home
and take charge. But I waited until
Woodruff and my; other faithful lieu
tenants had thoroughly convinced all
the officers of the machine now
desperate its plight was. and that
I alone - could repair and restore,
and that I could do it only If absolute
control were given me. .
A week or so "after I resumed the chair
manship Scarborough. invited me to lunch
alone with him at the White House.
When I had seen him four years before,
just after, his defeat, he was. in high
spirits and looked a youth. Now it de
pressed me, but gave . me no surprise to
find him worn and overcast by that tragic
sadness which canopies every one of the
seats of the mighty. "I fear, Mr. Presi
dent," said I. "you are hndlng the men
who will help you to carry out your ideas
as rare as I once warned you they were."
"Not rare," was his answer, "but hard
to get at through ' the throngs of Baal
worshipers that have descended upon nip
and are trying to hedge me in."

means. .You believe the best results can

passion against passion, by offsetting ar>

"Your method has had one recent and
very striking apparent success," said
I. "Butâ the spasm of virtue will pass â¢â¢
"Certainly." he replied, "and so too
will the succeeding spasm of reaction.
Also, your party must improve itselfrâ
and mine too â as the result of this
spasm of virtue."
"For a time,". I admitted. "I envy
you your courage and hope. But I
can't share in them. You will serve
four stormy years; you will retire
with friends less devoted and wnemies m
more, bitter; 'you will, be misunder
stood, maligned; and there's only a re
mole possibility that your vindication
will come before you are too old to be
offered a second term. And the har
vest from the best you sow will be
ruined in some flood of reaction. "
"No." he answered. "It will .be
reaped. The evil I do. all evil, passes.
The good will be reaped. Nothing
good is. lost." .
"And if It is reaped," I rejoined,
"the reaping will not come until luhÂ£.
long after you are. a mere name in hia
tory."
Even as I spoke my doubts I 'was
wishing, l had kept them to myself;
for. thought I, there's no poorer bus
iness than shooting at the beautiful
soaring bird. of illusion. But he. was
looking at me without seeing me. His
expression suggested the throwing
open of the . blinds- hiiLntf a .mau's in
most self.
' **If "at" man," "said he- absently;* "fties
hisv mind, not. Ob making: friend* or de
feating enemies, not on elections or
on' history, but just on avoiding from
day- to day. from act to .act. the con-,
demnation of his own self-respect â "
The blinds closed as suddenly as they
had opened â he had become conscious
that some one was looking in. And I
was wishing again that I had kept my
doubts to myself;- for I now saw that
what I had thought a bright bird of
illusion was in fact the lost "star which'
lighted my. own youth. . . Â» -.-;-â¢

In the following September X took
my daughters to Elizabeth. She looked
earnestly, first *at Frances, tall ' and
slim and fancying herself a woman

and struggling with the gigjlinj age.
"We shall like each other, I'm sure,"

V I men made speechesâ pretty good
â¢speeches, too, clevej. forceful ar.<l
effective, that held the interest and
attention, and. at times excited the ad
miration and enthusiasm of that big au
dience that by its very size showed the
interest San Francisco is taking in her
own well-being.
What those speakers gave us who lis
tened was oratory. well-intentioned, well
prepared, well-deliveredâ but still oratory.
They had spared no effort and slighted
no talent to be ingenious and effective.
They had decorated their arguments witn
*>he posies of rhetoric and* the spangles
&ot wit. Their speeches were speeches to
persuade and inflame, made according- to
tbe "time-honored pattern of campaign
speechesâ the accustomed weapons in the
game of politics.
We feltâ we who listened, and I've a no
lion I siÂ»eak for you if you were there,
*s well as for myselfâ that each speech
sis a performance and we were entitled
to our critical attitude.

of this greatest of gamesâ there came
a man down to the footlights, a young
man cf slight . figure and lean, wiry
ouild, with- " earnest, clean-cut, -serious
face. He came with a firm, light step,
quietly and without flourish. He stood
crulte still, waiting, through the storm
of greeting, and when silence fell he
spoke.
He had not spoken ten sentences before
weâ all of us In that assemblage packed
solidly from wall to wailâ saw that he
had no gift of oratory as an art; that he
fer.as not going through the campaign
irickÃ cf a candidate, as it were, and
giving us a sample speech, but Just a
straight talk.
We saw that he wasn't trying to per
euade or beguileâ only to convince.
His voice wasn't strong nor of elocu
tionary quality, but there . was in It a
note of passionate earnestness that car
ried his words to every listener in the
topmost gallery.
His gestures were not frequent nor^
dramatic nor particularly illustrativeâ
and certainly not mirror-practiced. They
were rather unimportant. In fact even a
little inadequate for any other sort of a
man.
His sentences were not flowery, but
. well-balanced, incisive, conveying his
thoughts accurately, unequivocally, ab-
Keolutely without ambiguity.

In his words as in his attitude there
was no flourish.
In the big auditorium there was no
murmur of comment, no rustle of move-
J|fStnt. The listening silence was so In
. Ur.se that it seemed almost as If all those
people breathed in rhythm. The critical
attitude was suspended.
While that slight young man talked
it was as if heart met heart and mind
. met mind in naked, trusting, honest con
tact.
All speciousness and suspiciousness, all
expediency and pretense and trumpery
were stripped off and cast aside.
In all the vast assemblage there was
not one, I'm sure, that did not recognize
Â» and accept him as absolutely honest,
sincere and genuine.
And the slight young man was John
g. Partridge, of course.
I am, perversely, beginning at tbe
end of my story, for my story to-day
Is of a day â a busy dayâ with the can
didate for Mayor, of a day's doings in
practical politics, and the big meeting
at tbe Alliambra was, of course, the last
event of the day chronologically.
But it Is the first in Importance, and I
would not have you miss the picture.
In that meeting between John i>. Part-
and the people of San Fran
fci'sco â as many of them as could be

grip 'of man on man lies in .his truth
and sincerity. . ;~"
I wonder how many in that "i^udience

S. Partridge is not elected Mayor or San

- When the speechmaking was done
and the applause had died out and the
shuffle of departing feet was ebbing and
I went to- John S. Partridge in the box,
where his family and. personal friends
were waiting to take him home, and
asked him, to tell me just how he
meant to make his fight for the mayor
alty, this is what he answered me:
"I'm srolnfr to tnlk to the people in
word* of one nyllnhlr, so â¢ that even
those who are asrnlnst me trill . have
no doubt abont where I: stand.,
"I'm ' Rolng: to rlvc tIV facts as I

men believe In hljch-Moundlngr phranes.
"The ereat thins in a n*ht like this,
where tbe lasue Is one of principle, Is
to !Â»*â¢ rlÃht with yourself, and then you
rant help beins: right with the people.**
He doesn't want to N *Â»e elected at. ANY
price, you ccc. He has a* price of his
own, and it does not include the sacri
fice of any friend's political principle.
He is not going around button-holing
his friends and Imploring them to
"Vote for me, for ME â your friend
John Partridge. Never mind politicsâ
but vote for Me."
On the contrary, he is saying: "Don't
vote for me unless you believe in the
principles I staita for. Don't give me Â«
your vote merely on personal grounds."
That's a most unusual candidate,
don't you think, a queer sort of a poli
tician? But that is John S. Partridge,
reform candidate for Mayorâ not only :
on the platform, but' from early morn
ing until late at night of the day on
which I follow. in his wake' to -'sec, him
do politics.
" It is a day that begins early in the'
morning, at half-past eight, in his
office.
He does no politics in his own modest
home in the Mission. He has not even
'; a telephone there by which politics can
be thrust, in upon, its peace and quiet;
. but no sooner does he set foot beyond
,lts doorstep, at 8 o'clock, than he be

comes the candidate for Mayor. The
first man passing on, Guerrero street
recognizes him as such, and wishes him
well, or buttonholes him to advise him
\u25a0 â or ask something ofâ him. So does
the next man he meets on , the corner,
and the man on the car he comes down
'town on, for all the Mission knows him.
At his law offices in the Call building
the real day's work of campaigning be
gins>-*-wlth the people waiting to tell
him what is being done for him, and
what isn't being done, what .should be
done and what shouldn't'be done. They
follow'each other 'as closely as \u25a0 beads
on a string, and the String \u25a0â¢ runs
through all the hours of the day and.
as many of the night as the candidate
and his lieutenants are accessible^ '
The places of meeting may shift from
the law-offices on the tenth floor of the
Call building to the corridor, -to -the
elevator, t6 the street, to the personal
headquarters in the Spreckels Annex
next door, to the Republican .League
headquarters at 636 Market street, to
the . street car,, street corner, or any
where â¢where one man. may grasp the
hand and . engage the ear of another,
but the succession of< men who liaye
the infallible recipe for the winning
of the election is without intermission.
What a great. game is this game of ;
politics! '
And what a big place it has in man's
life!
How; absorbing is the interest in it!

There's the man. careful kindly soul,
who wants Mr. Partridge to come into
another room with him where in privacy
he can show Mr. Partridge how most ef
fectively to sit when facing the audience
from 'a platform. He thinks Mr. Par
tridge is not sufficiently attentive to his
posingâ which, heaven be thanked, is
perfectly true.
And another photographer.

And there's the Spring Valley case in
court. Even on his busy day Mr. Par
tridge finds the time in that cool un
hurried way of hi 3 to attend to this duty.
One of the provisions he has made
is that when he is elected â WHEN is
the word, remember â he is to retain
the privilege to go on with the Spring
Valley case. >*
On his busy day there is a witness
to be examined In this case, and he
slips quietly away from between the
demands on his time to the court room
in the new Postofflce* building- to do
that. -
Out of the myriad* distractions of
campaigning he steps t and bends hi 3
mind in that still courtroom to the
careful consideration of the the min
utae of expert testimony. The witness
Is suffering 1 the effects of recent Illness,
and the humanity of Partridge Is ex
pressed i&Â» the gentle consideration of
voice and. manner as he asks him his
questions, but the ylgllahce of the alert
lawyer is in the questions.
He doesn't see all the ' people who
make their demands upon his time, of
course. It is beyond one man's capaci
ty to do that, but with all that he sees
and in all that he does he ts the simple,
unselfconoscious man, giving; his at
tention wholly to the matter before
In the day's doings, in all this meeting:
of people. I make a discovery for myself,
and It is that John S. Partridge Is not
what is called "a good mixer."
He is not what Is best described In
handy slang "a hot-air artist."
He is too sincere to acquire popularity
by the oily, easy glad-hand method.
He is not beguiling, but he^ is can-~
vincing. /
I noticed that the many men who came
to shake hands and wish htm well did
not 'slap him on the back, but they did
give him ready respect.
lf'.heia not a good mixer he yet has
tact and courtesy and kindliness. He is
receptive, listening with keen interest to
the other man's opinion, never supercili
ous never self-sumcientâ and never sub
servient, and the men woo came to shake
hands with him seemed to give him their
ready respect, because they could re
spect themselves in giving It.
The men who came, too. were not of
the usual type peculiar to political head
quarters-that sleek, slightly shabby
type, loose-cheeked, furtive-eyed, soft
handcu and whispering, but very much
of the same clean, clear-cut, aggressive.,
energetic type that the candidate for
Mayor is. They looked like men who have
homes and famllies'and regularity of bar
bers and pay days. They came in as
' though they came, for a definite purpose,
and they went away as though they had
some place to go and something to do
when they got thereâ a new type of poli
tician rallying around a new type of can
didate.AMERICAN INGENUITY IN

is only in its infancy. Up to a few years
ago managers simply rehashed plays im
ported from Europe, until the firm of
Klaw & Erlanger entered the field. Their
progreEsivenet-s worked wonders, and to
day it can be truthfully stated that their
individual efforts have succeeded in
eclipsing all foreign importations. In
New JTork City away Lack in the "60"s.
when Jarrett 6z Palmer presented "The
Klack Crook." and spectacles criginate-1
by the Kiraify brothers, the only pieca ol
Mage mechanism that the public mar
veled at was a "trap" cut in the stage
through which one of the performers
made a sj.-ringing entrance. In those tlays
a melodrama called "The World" had a
tccne showing a iaft at sea being
to jxeits l>y huge waves, which arousea
cc-iiSJCieiabie interest. In IW>j the lirin of
Klaw i Erlar.gcr, in conjunction with C.
B. Jefferson, a sen of Joseph Jefferson,
commenced producing. Their firs 1 , play,
"A Dark Bccrct." was brought out at the
New York Academy of Music. One of the
Bccnee showed the c-mire -Plage covered
with water to represent a real lake, with
boats sailing to and fro. It scored an in
stantaneous bit and tired this progressive
i:rm with an ambition to attempt bigger
things. Next on their list , was "The
Country Circus," giving a parade on the
stage with hors^v. animals, all kind of
live stock and wagons, the same as Ring
ling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey pre
sent to-day in t"he public thoroughfares.
This attempt was also highly successful,
and from that lime on they have stopped
at nothing in the way of expense in giv
ing the American public the biggest in
dvxÂ»r entertainment possible.
Eight year* ago the attention of Klaw
&. Erlanger was drawn to General Lew
Wallace's interesting novel', "Ben Hur,"
and negotiations started toward drama
tizing it. General Wallace was like the
man from Missouri, "lie had to be
shown"â that is, iie yould not agree to
his work bci: g dramatized unless the
chariot race could be as realistically pre
sented as his description in the book. It
is here the creative American mechanist
showed his capacity, for Klaw & Er
langer commissioned every one of promi
nence in this countr;- to furnish practi
cal working models of this big scene, and
the prize was won by Claude Hagan. It
.coft thou nds of dollars in experiment
ing, but a rich reward nas been reaped,
lor ir. the six years that "Ben Hur" has
been before the public a profit of over
$2,000,000 has been earned. The mechani
cal device which Mr. Hagan employed
in constructing this scene is not new to
the siago. In its r simpler sense it has
been the backbone of "The County Fair"
and many other plays and has helped en
rich the men who have' had stage melo
dramas, with their accompaniment of
etorms, steamships, moving trains, life
bridges and avalanches. But these have
all been cheap illusions, while the chariot
rao; in "Ben Hur" is not. In fact, this
6cene as now presented is acknowledged
to be the most thrilling stage picture
ever shown within the four walls of a
playhouse. It is a. race scene in which
the runner does not progress. It differs
from the horse races in such plays as
"In Old Kentucky," "The Suburban" and
"Checkers," where the horses are ridden
from wing to wing. In playa where the
horses actually cross the stage there is
no need of an illusion to give the appear
ance of movement, but in a race like that
driven by the charioteer in "Ben Hur."
where the horses actually run but do not
move forward, there must be some me
chanical means of deceiving the eye tc
give the impression of actual progress.
It is such casts as this that makes "Ben
Hur" a mechanical triumph. There ie
nothing half done. The illusion is com
plete, even to the whirring of the wheels
and driving clouds of dust that fly from
the imaginary floor of the hippodrome.
It is not behind the scenes that you
find the secret of all this, but down be
neath the stage in a wilderness of dy
namos, electric wires, windlasses, shafts
ana wheels. While the horses are pound
ing out thunder on the stage floor dur
ing the race, the under region is like a
bee-hive. Electricians run here and
there, throwing 1 switches and giving sig
nals. The men are tugging at windlass
crunks. The signal bells from which
wires lead to the stage above keep up a
constant dinâ one ring for one switch,
two rinjrs for another and so on. Only
two minutes it lasts, but durlnz those
minutes the tension in the under re
gions is greater than In the audience,
which is at rim stunned and then torn
into a perfect paroxysm of cheers, so
you see that not all the effect of the
chariot race Is exerted upon the nerves'
of those who pay to see the spectacle.
There are other men who are paid to be
there, who are worn out with the terri
fic work of those two minutes under the
stage.

You may hug close to the scenery and

But It all teaches you quickly what a

spectacle of this kind and how far the
public demands , that thoss who furnish
tnese things shall go to satisfy the hun

It does not take a mechanic to sec how
much work has been done in staging
the "Ben Hur" chariot race. For a month
Lelore the first performance a large force
of carpenters, steel workers and elec
. tricians worked upon this odd race course
and its mechanical equipment. The stage
of thÂ« tnÂ«ater has to be carefully recon

sustain its great weight. A bungling Job
in the slightest detail would spoil tho
whole spectacle. That it has never been
spoiled Is a wonder and a tribute on the
intelligence ot the advance carpenter.
When in position for an .ordinary per
formance the floor of the stage is four

to which it can be lowered. For the
chariot race it is at the lowest position.
Above this stage floor Is built another

cept the race. Upon . the stage floor
proper are built trenches and In these the
horses run four abreast upon treadmills.
These' treadmills are ail laid horizontally
â¢and each is j independent of'the other. In
sets of i four the treadmills are built In
strong carriers that furnish the equip
ment which gives the v Illusion of Ben
Hur gaining, upon and passing Messala
in tha race. Ben Hur's four horses,
which are running upon the four .tread
mills in tha trench nearest tho footlights,
are started at the left side of the stage
running toward the right. Messala's four
are started at the right side. This places
Messala several feet In the lead of Ben
Hur. ~ \u25a0"\u25a0: \u25a0\u25a0-\u25a0', '-'ViT.':-
' Beneath the stage at the right side are
windlasses and an equal number un
der the left side. When the race begins,
with Ben Hur behind Messala* for one
minute the carriers are allowed to remain
in the "location they occupy at the be
ginning of the race. In the wings to the
right stands the stage manager with two
magnets 1 In his hands. Each of these
magnets is" attached to electric wires
which run to an electric bell beneath the
stage. .When Messala. confident of win
ning the race, turns in his chariot to Jeer
at Ben Hur, the stage manager brings
the magnets together. This is the signal
for the men at the windlasses to make

When the audience decs Ken Hur ris
ing to his full height in h's chariot and
begin laying on the !aah. the stage man
ager strikes the mcgneU tv/ics together.
The mpn at the* windlasses begin turning
the cranks slowly. Slowly, almost im
perceptibly. Ken Hur gains upon Mes
sala. Actually, ilassala's horses have been
drawn backward Just as far as Een Hur's
four have been drawn forward. Messala
sets Ben "Hur creeping slowly forward,
gaining slightly every eecond, but yet
not rapidly enough" to win the race. H<Â»
turns and tho whip circles- about his
four white ~ horses, but. both for stags
purpose* and in reality, they are running
at their utmost speed. Again the auOU
ence sees Ben Hur raise his arm and ttm.
lash shoots out over the backs of th<*
four animals he is driving? They can gÂ»
no faster, for they. too. are .unning at
top speed.
But the stage manager makes them
gam. In the cyclone of noise which the
running horses" b^at from *.*e treadmills
the audience 2s deafened, but down below
the bell Is ringing continually. The stage
manager is playing v tattoo with the
magnets. The panorama ia set going
faster, until the painted figures in the
tiers -of the amphitheater are lost in a
blur.
The noise , from the stage stuns thÂ»
audience. Down below it is the noise
of machinery that is heard. Every bell
is ringing, every shaft turning. The men
at the windlasses, with the slow, steady
motion, grind at the ropes which lead
up over the pulleys to the carriers in the
trenches.' The bell beneath the stags
rattles five times: the men at the wind
lasses work a little faster. Twice the
bell rings. That Is the signal to slow
down. By this time Ben Hur's four
steeds are neck and neck with Messala's
four.
Just as Ben Hur's chariot draws oppo
site the one In which Messala rides the
audience sees the right wheel of Mes
sala's chariot torn from the axle, a trick
of the stage mechanist of to-day. Ths
stage manager again brings his magnet
into play. Four times he clicks them to
gether; a man under the stage jerks a
rope which runs through the floor be
neath Messala's chariot to a trigger on
the axle. JPiis trigger releases a stout
spring" which throws tne wheel. *
It is .then that the stage manWjSr
becomes the busiest man in tha world.
As fast 'as his hands can move ha
clocks the magnets. Below, the men
&.t the windlasses work with all their
might. .Messala'3 chariot is brought
forward with a jerk, and Ben Hur'3
is drawn as rapidly forward. All the
horses are plunging as fiercely as ever,
but the sudden widening of the space
between the two chariots seems to tho
audience to be the result of the vlctor"3
sudden forward dash in a race that iJ
not an illusion.
This race has lasted two minutes,
as long as a real race at a mile and
a furlong 1 . \u25a0On a race course the
charioteers would have covered r.lmost
a mile. Just as tho two minutes pass
there is a shrill v/histle from the
"flies." As quick as a fta3h all lights
are out. There are loud cries of
"Whoa! Whoa!" but "this 'is not hetird
by the audience, for the \u25a0 "hoofs of the
horses are still pounding the treadmills.
Within thirty seconds the drivers bring
them all to a stop.
The engine that moves th panorama
i 3 brought to a standstill. The stage
manager drops his magnets. The race
is over. ,
Five minutes later the false stage
floor has been relald, new scenery has
taken the place of the panorama and
the curtain rises to give the audience a
glimpse- of an interior of tho palace of
Ben Hur In Jerusalem.
The treadmills upon which the horses
run are not unlike the treadmills uaefi
for power purposes, such^as all r. Â«Â»y
seen at a sorghum or grist mill down
in the country. But these treadmills
are carefully and strongly built. They
turn upon the most perfect ball bear
ings, and with your little finger you
can start them as easily as the horses
start them with their galloping hoofs.
To the audience the spinning chariot
wheels seem to be upon the floor of the
sugc. But. the weight of the chariots
does not rest at all upon the :wheel3.
The cars are poised on a rod. which fits
into a steel pipe run through the stags
floor. The wheels are turned by small
motors beneath the treadmills.
The clouds of dust which apparently
are thrown by the horses* hoofs coma
from small boxes beneath the chariots.
These boxes have a bellows attachment,
which blows out clouds '. of fine sand.
Another complete illusion Is that of the.
apparent backward movement of the
track upon which the horses seem to be
running. This moving track is nothing
more or less than canvas belts painted
cray They are turned by small wheels
placed upon shafts projecting through the
stage floor. Bentath the stage these
shafts connect by flanged cog-wheels
with a transverse shaft which turns not
only the big wheels but the panorama
The panorama is formed by three great
scenic belts, two of them with a thirty
foot face being placed diagonally at the
sides of the stage, and one forty feet
long being at the rear. Upon these^belt*.
which are twenty feet wide, is pal*r!Â»i
an interior view, of thÂ« amphitheater,
with its tiers of steps filled with spec
tators This panorama moves in th* di
rection opposite to those In which tha

pression of a progressive movement of
the chariots.

- \u25a0end.)FIGHTING FIRE IN THE SNOW-SHEDS
THE average passenger journeying
over the Sierras usually utters a
derp Figh of relief -when his train
emerges from the snowsheds. They
have formed one bleak, uninterest
ing section of the journey, relieved only
by a monotonous succession of tantaliz
ing glimpses of striking tcenery through
the breaks and cracks in a dead wall of
grimy timbers. The cars have filUd with
suffocating smoke and life has been made
miserable for a time. It is natural, then,
that but UttJe of interest should attach
to the snowslieds. The ordinary traveler
dewctts them, and knows little and cares
less about the system which protects thi3
valuable part of the railroad equipment
from destruction by fire. For dull and
uninteresting as the .sheds themselves
may be, they are, nevertheless, an Indis
pensable and necessary part of mountain
railroad construction. Upon their main
tenance depend the "safety and security
of the leads of passengers and freight
which form the heavy traffic over the
mountain division. Accordingly, the pres
ervation and protection of the snowsheds
from the ravages of fire forms one of the
meat Interesting features of railroad ad
ministration In California.
The long line of snowsheds on the di
vision between Sacramento and Sparks,
Nev., begins at a point near Blue Canyon,
and winds Its tortuous way up the steep
grades of the Sierra Nevada Mountains,
over their summit, and down the eastern
dope almost to Truckee. This stretch of
forty miles of railroad Is through the
very heart of the Sierras, where the
snows of winter fall to a great depth,
varying from five to thirty feet, and ac
cumulate In great drifts, blocking and
burying out of sight the ordinary high
ways of travel. To protect the railroad
from this danger of Interruption of com
munication and blockade of traffic, the
snowsbeds were built over the track,
forming a shelter for the trains. These m
cheds are not of temporary character, in
tended for on* season only, to be replaced
the next, bet are strongly and substan
tially built, designed to withstand the
fiercest onslaughts of nature's forces. The
timbers are twelve and eighteen inches
t quart, and the planks on the sides and
roof an from two to four Inches thick.
The sheds are firmly braced and tied to
gether, and anchored securely.
The original cost of the snowsheds
stands a tidy sum on the books of the
railroad company, and the annual ex
penditure for repairs and maintenance
represents a small fortune. It was once
stated by Leland Stanford that the sheds
originally cost 11,500,000. Lest year the
repairs and overhauling of the sheds was
a charge of over (100,000. It Is little won
der, then, that the line of sheds is care
fully watched and protected from fire.
The sheds are peculiarly liable to de
struction by fire. The passing locomo
tives emit 6parks which lodge in the
OPORTUNITY VS. HANDICAPS
IT WAS the fixed belief of all of the
members of the Dubb fanuly that
Percy %as an "it," with an adult I.
In the first place he was the last of
the lot to arrive on the scene, a sort
of an encore. As though that were not
enough, his parents had immediately
loaded him down with the polite but In
vidious appellation of Percy. It is a well
known fact that a boy named Percy has
about as much chance of arriving at ulti
mate, or any other kind, of greatness as
a Massachusetts Republican has of car
rying the solid South In a Presidential
campaign.
Another obstacle* that Percy was up
against from the start was the fact that
he v.as the youngest son. Youngest sons
are usually regarded as more or less sur
plusage, a reserve force in the family
stable, so to speak. If be runs well,
everybody Is surprised and mildly happy,
but no one puts his money on him. The
timbers Uiat.are as dry as cracklings,
and this is a frequent source of disas
trous flres. Besides this, forest fires and
burning brush often ignite the sheds. The
pine lumber of which the sheets are built
is fat with pitch and thoroughly dried by
the combined heat of the passing loco
motives Inside and the rays of the cum
mer sun without. This makes excellent
fuel for the names. And when they are
once started they v spread with lightning
like rapidity along the line of sheds, as
if it were a train of powder. The long
line of sheds acts as a huge chimney with
a powerful draft, and not much time is
required for* a small blaze to develop
into a fire of ugly proportions.
The protection of the shedg from the
ravages cf fire is a matter of prims im
portance. The sheds must be kept intact,
for otherwise the line, of travel would
be hopelessly blockaded in the winter
season. And here, as elsewhere in the
gigantic corporation, system and organi
zation are necessary. A fire in the sheds
is a costly blaze and one of the things
most dreaded in railway circles, because
of the danger to life and property in
volved and the interruption of traffic. The
organization of the flre brigade must be
and is as highly efficient and as thor
oughly trained as any company in a
metropolitan flre department.
The system which secures this protec
tion consists of two parts; first, the fire
patrol, and second, the flre trains and
their crews.
The flre patrol keeps the closest watch*
for any outbreak of flre through the
track walkers and the lookouts. Eternal
vigilance Is the price of safety in the
snowsheds, and herein is demonstrated
the efficiency of the patrol. The track
walkers are men constantly patrolling the
track before and after trains pass
through the sheds to Inspect the condi
tion of the track and to see that ob- '
structions are removed to prevent acci
dents. Their beat is usually three miles
in length. One of their most Important
duties Is the detection of flre in the
sheds. At short intervals along the line,
about three-fourths of a mile apart, there
are signal boxes, connected with the sta
tions where the flre trains are located.
When a track walker discovers a flre
he turns In the alarm at the nearest sig
nal box, and the" alarm is registered at
Summit, Blue Canyon and Truckee. Tha

The main flre lookout is located on the
top of Red Mountain, a high peak of
the Blerras near Cisco. Red Mountain is
about 8000 feet high. From Its summit

Thus it will be seen that Percy was up
against it from the time the curtain, rose
on his little act. His other brothers, who
had been given good, useful names, like
John Henry, William or Charles Edward,
names that are guaranteed not to rip,
ravel or run down at the heel, were al
ready well established in tho favor of
visible.*"' 'A "more suitable watch tower,
than ; this lofty peak, .rearing its head
into the clear Sierra sky, could hardly
be found anywhere. The exceedingly dry,
cleer atmosphere makes it possible to see
distinctly for great- distances. The flre
lookout is maintained day and night, and
from this excellent point of vantage the
first outbreak of fire can be located. With
telescopes and field glasses trained on
the sinuous line of sheds winding In and
out among the mountains the lookout
commands the situation absolutely. An
incessant, unrelaxing ' vigil guards the
line of travel from the attacks of the
ravaging flames. The instant a fire is
detected by the watchers on Red Moun
tain the alarm is sent to the stations
where the fire trains are held In waiting.
In the fire patrol, besides the track
walkers and the main lookout on Red
Mountain, the company also has special
watchmen stationed ;at other points of
long range of vision, such as Tunnel No.
Six, Lakeview, Shed Twenty-nine and
'Tunnel No. Five. *
' On the portion of the Sacramento divis
ion where the snowsheds are located th,ere_
are three fire trains, one stationed at"
Summit, one at Cisco and one at Blue
Canyon. Each train is made up of afire
ergine, which is a locomotive) equipped
with a powerful pump throwing three
.streams of water,, a. tender, and two
water cars. The trains are also equipped
with telegraph and telephone outfits.' The
ctrs have tanks capable of holding 18,500
gallons of water. They are fully equip
pÂ«d with fire hose, some of it on. reels
and some laid out on. top of the cars, also
ladders, axes, saws, ropes and pike poles.
Around the top of the cars, on which
tl;e crew rides, runs a stout railing to

â¢must not *forget the extras and specials
that may be on the road. He must think
of a multitude of things in a brief period
of time. He is rapidly sizing up the situ
ation as with feverish haste he fingers
the pages of the time table and register.
It is a scene of intense dramatic action
taking place in the little office of the
operator, with the engineer as the chief
figure.
The engineer checks the train register
to see what trains due have not arrived.
The superintendent in,- Sacramento givs
him running orders and train rights.
Sometimes, however, the telegraph wires
are down and* communication is impossi
ble. In such event the engineer proceeds
to the fire by "blocking" from station to
station by use of the telephone: If the
telephone wires shquld also be down, he
sends a "man ahead of the' train on foot
or on a gravity car to protect the fire
train from opposing trains. !
Meantime the crew/consisting of about
a dozen men, have clambered on the
train, some on top of the water cars,
some on the rear pilot, and all await the
start. Having received orders which
give him the absolute right of way over
all other trains, - and the track being
cleared, the engineer pulls open the throt
tle and the wild ride begins. In less than
three minutes after the receipt, of thÂ«"
alarm the.train Is speeding away to the
scene of danger.- Every pound of steam
that can be safely crowded on is applied
in the_ race with the, flames. The engine
and cars sway from; side to eide as they
swing around the sharp curves, and the
train flashes past the stations and block
houses. It Is a thrilling and dangerous
ride. The speed attained on the se runs
of the fire train often exceeds a mile per
minute, and somo of the stretches or
road- are not built especially, for such
exhibitions of record-breaking time. It
certainlyiis a test of grit and pluck to
guide a ftraln In such a meteoric flight.
In a few minutes the train has reached
the scene of the fire. 'Then comes the

This is my greeting from
"â Captain Ross, in charge of
construction of the Pacific "Wireless
Telegraph Company's new station on
Mount Tamalpais as I, breathless,
reach the top of the slope.
"If the car that was just ahead of
you had broken loose from the hoisting
engine, It would have gone_down hill
at a great rate, taking you with It,"
he continues, sternly.
"But nothing like that ever did hap
pen here," I offer. In a still, small voice,
hoping he will adroit he has been pic
turing a vague might-have-been.
"Oh. yes. It did," he replies. "One
day when we had the car loaded with
those big twelve-by-twelves it broke
loose and the timbers went flying over
the slope as far as Redwood Springs."
I promise j.Â«>ver to do it again.
I had not thought of any danger In
climbing the spur leading: from the
main line of the "crookedest railroad In
the world" to the top of the West peak,
but only of the distance that seemed
endless and the slope that I after
ward learned shows an incline of 37^4
per cent.
A heavy fog enveloped the mountain
â though the sun had shown brightly
enough until we reached the double
bowknot point in the ascentâ and it
was impossible to see more than a few
feet ahead. Just when I began to fear
I should never reach the summit, the
cloud curtain was lifted by a breath
of wind and I stood face to face with
many evidences that the new station
will soon be an accomplished fact.
The most striking evidence, the thing
that dwarfs everything else in sight, is
a great trianguar structure that lies
across the little pleateau of the sum
mit and is supported by a long trestle
out over the slope. It is tht first of
the great towers of the most powerful
wireless telegraph station ever planned.
At first glance, with its coat of black
paint, it appears to be of iron, but Cap
tain Ross, designer and builder, points
out that It is entirely of wood (Oregon
fir for the most part, though there is
some oak in its construction), and that,
the only metal are the bolts and braces
which are to enable it to resist the
strongest winds that may blow. It is
three hundred feet long, tapering from
twenty feet wide at the base to four
feet at the top. and weighs sixty tons.
If this tower had been built as a
square it could have grown from the
foundation upward, timber upon timber,
and there would have been no problem
of raising it In one piece. But a square
tower offers too much resistance to the
wind, and if you have ever stood on the
summit of Mount Tamalpais you know
â¢â¢hat the strongest winds on this pen
iÂ«i)--il:i are as summer zephyrs in com
iv...'*un with the breath that there
ijcios from the Pacific.
An equilateral triangle was the form
determined u*>on, and the two towers
were built accordingly at Adams
wharf, in Oakland. After being found
satisfactory in every detail they were
taken apart, ferried across to Sausalito
and sent uo the mountain to their Â»ew
home. Here, on the long' trestle, the
first of them has been put together, and
as It now lies completed the base all
but touches the foundation of natural
rock and concrete that is ready to re
ceive it.
The West peak, as I should tell you. Is
about a quarter ol a mile from the fa
mous Tamalpais Tavern and is over 2000
feet high, far above all natural obstruc
tions, if, Indeed, anything can be consid
ered an obstruction to this wonderful
force of electricity.
On first inspection it gave no evidence
of having been especially designed by a
bountiful nature for the site of awireless
nation. The crest of the hill was held
Ly irregular rocks, soft and shaley. with
hardy chaparral, the long roots eighteen
inches underground, growing in the crev
ices and wherever the rocks gave place.
In order to provide a level of 115x40
feet, Â©30 tons of this rock were blasted
off. Other blasting cleared the way for
the 10SO feet of special track and when
that was laid the company felt they were
really making headway.
, Up its steep incline the small -flat cars
have made countless trips carrying tim
bers, heavy chains, iron cables, hawser?,
bolts, tools and all the many parts that
go t^> form the stupendous whole. They
have been passenger cars, as well, for
though visitors have not been frequent,
there are some forty workmen, ship
builders, riggers and Italian laborers,
who have cone up and down the short
length of the line many, many times.
Notwithstanding Us rock ballast, this
track showed a tendency to uilde down
ward and in order to anchor it securely
a "dead man" was put in. That sounds
ghoulish, doesn't it? I doÂ«e to me until
Captain Roes explains that a dead-man
is a heavy block of wood burled as far
below the surface as needs be to reach
bed rock, to which it is held by long bolts
ar.d cement. By chains or wire cables
the track is attached to this dead-man
and all chance of its yielding to the force
of gravity is at an end. ~. *
As we go over the work, we come
across other dead-men, many of themâ as
if the hill had served Bat Masterson for
iL last resting place of those offenders
\u25a0** cscne under his official notice.
On the western slope, perhaps one hun- '
dred and twenty-five feet from the foun
dation waiting for the first tower, there
is the longest mound of all and as we
look at it recall that, "There were giants
in those days."
"Yes." answters my guide, "there was
one thirty feet long. It lies fifteen feet
below the surface and is held by eye
bolts to the bed rock. Six barrels of
cement icakt it solid as the rock itself
ar.fi I think we could tear the mountain
down before it would come out. That
will be our main support."
By means of two crab capstans, them
selves anchored to the solid rock, have
been raised the masts o"r shears which
are to aid In lifting the tower. These
masts are 140 feet high aad weigh IS
tons, bo that the problem of putting them
In position and holding them securely by
ruy wires was no simple one and Jts
solution argues a favorable outcome for
the greater effort bo soon to be made.

From these shears extends a heavy
Â«able to the prostrate frame around
which are eight lashings. The first lash
ing Is made 150 feet from the foot or
heel, and the. last one 60 feet from the
top. By bridles these lashings arc joined
In sets of two. then groups one and two
are joined, as are three and four, and
another bridle joins the two groups thus
formed. This last bridle "represents the
main purchase of the cable, in lifting thc^
tower.
Because it would not be possible for
men on the sides of the mountain to' pay
out the guy wires evenly ' as the tower*
goes up, cavils are arranged on the front
legs of the tower, at the heel, and every
guy wire comes to a cavil and Is num
bered. The men are similarly numbered
and will be easily under the direction of
their foreman.
I wish I could tell you of all the dif
ficulties the builders have encountered
and the ingenuity they have shown.
You would be interested in the way

Marconi used a. ten-Inch Induction coll
V ' ' ' ' '\u25a0
by. means of. which he caused a spark. to
pass through a spark gap about three
quarters of an irrch.in length. The pole
supporting the'air wires, was only .one
hundred and fifty feet high. ,
From '; some' source I ' had the state
ment that a wire twenty feet high will,
carry an effective signal oiie mile; for
ty fpet high, four miles;' eighty feet
high, 16 mile*-, and so in like ratio. I
asked \u25a0â¢\u25a0\u25a0".whether.-.. this were true and
whether/. all", things would not there
fore,',', be j possible to-; a., three hundred 'â¢\u25a0
foot tower so set as to be 'practically,
three thousand feet* above" the sea.
It was polrited-out that the theoryjof:
exact ratio "between the height of the"
mast or tower and the distance to
which : service would be rendered :was a
mistaken ont 1 and. that:, the main value '
of. the high towers lies in the fact'that
thoy/mny carry a sTeator; quantity of
the 'copper jwlre- necessary ; f or handling*
the powerful current without which, the
cloctrlo' waves cannot be sent 'over long
distances. ' ,/ '\u25a0^~~ 7 l : ~
It "is claimed that this problem of
handling the current generated is the
only one. to bt considered in the es
tablishment â¢of wireless telegraphic
communication with Japan and as soon
as the new station, is completed, as
soon as ; the operators become accus
tomed to using its enormous power,
tests'wlll be made to establish definitely
its possibilities. \u25a0
The transmitting instrument in prac
tically all wireless telegraphy systems
is a key not unlike. that with which we
are familiar: In! the "Morse" and other
wlre-and-pole- systems. The point of
contact ,- Is much larger In the - wireless
instrumf-ntsOhowevcr, for whereas In
the^ Morse. key there Is a point of only
orfe-thirty-second of an inch. - the wlre
kss key provides for contact" of about
one-fourth of an inch. This for the
reason that a very much stronger' Im
pulse isjmeded In sending the wireless
messages than in '.communicating by the
older telegraphic method.
Every iuf-entor ot. a. plan of wireless
telegraphy., and there are many, has in
the receiving apparatus his paten tea
feature. According to certain sys
tems communications are received as a
series of dots and dashes impressed upon
a narrow paper tape, dots and dashes
which the operator reads by sight, or
touch, or both, and transcribes.
Some others, including: the onÂ»
to be used on Mount Tamalpals, have
the - receiving instrument equipped with
a microphone Dy which the dots ami
dashes are audible to the operator, who
writes the messages as rapidly as heard.
It is claimed that the average -of fifteen
to twenty words per minute made by op
erators of the former can be raised to
thirty-five to forty words per minute by
use of the microphone.
"Kow does It happen." I asked, "that
other people do not read your messages,
since the common air is the medium?"
"Well," replied General Manager New.
"If other people, will equip -themselves
with a complete apparatus and a receiv
ing station and will arrange to have their
Instrument tuned to the same rate of vi
bration as the transmitting Instrument,
they can intercept messages, but don't
yon think it would be a difficult thing
to do?
"One can get a little outfit for $2 50
by which he can tap the ordinary tele
graph wire and learn what messages
are being" transmitted, or he may even
get communications by induction without
having any outfit at all. If he under
takes to intercept wireless messages he
will find It a very different proposition.
"Experiments have been made to de
termine whether one station could read
the messages intended for another and
the tests have always shown that unless
the same rate of vibration was secured
in both no Intelligible word could be re
ceived."
Since the* power of the Impulses de
termines the distance to which messages
can be sent, it is plain that vessels at
.sea can receive reports from the Mount
Tamalpais station when they cannot re
ply, their own equipment being neces*
sarlly much lighter.' It is confidently
expected, however, that it will be a sim
ple matter for ships to send messages to
the mountain station â or any other sta 5 .
tion for that matterâ from points 400 Â«>r
500 mil*>s at sea. and early in the nÂ»rv
year, whep thi3 station will be com
pleted, steamer equipment will be ready
for use so that practical trials can be
made.
If v/e are to appreciate the rapidity with
which wireless telegraphy, has been de
veloped we must bear in mind that it Is
hardly ten years since the first actual es
tablishment of this form of communica
tion according to a syst< n that was sat

It was a year later that Marconi, who

r y m [ MAZIAH, you dare read off
. Jsv* f I your composition now," said
fâ | Ell' Darmstetter, addressing
V, I the largest pupil of the class
JL that sat before him in his
fc-choolroom. one warm afternoon* in
April.
Amaziah Mas a stalwart young man
of 20; his sun-browned fact and hands
bore evidence that he was a son of the
soil, and his countenance, though some
what heavy, was *o open and honest,
hSb eyes ana mouth so kindly, that the
heart of the comely Elviny warmed to
him.
This youth of 20 and damsel of 17
were by no means exceptionally old pu
pils In the Canaan District School, the
short winter term of six months giving
so little opportunity for an education
that many of the sons and daughters
of the district farmers availed them
e*lve*> thereof til! even a later age.
\u25a0rt.m-T.ziah in a loud though embar
rassed voice announced his subject and
read his production.
"The study of Geography which so
many people delight in studying, is
studied in all most all parts of the
Earth and has been studied since the
beginning of the World already. With
out Geography we could not get along
just so very well still, for if we wanted
to gro to Philadelphia. We might go to
Harrlsburg In a mistake not knowing
what direction Philadelphia was from
us. When Columbus sailed from Spain
in search of the new World He might
of vent in the opposite direction if He
liad not of studied Geography before he
undertook the expedition. Geography
Is off great importance to travelers that
>Â«ye to trftvel all over the World 4or
-Â«k>hey did not know where th* places ;.
tftey wanted to travel was They might
of never found the places they -wanted
to travel." . . .
Amaziah had often Baid that he
would rather plow. for a week than-
write one composition. The above had
been an especially strenuous effort,
made in the hope that E]viny "wouldn't
think he was so wonderful dumb, for
all he couldn't speak off pieces of po
etry as good as her."
He looked vastly relieved as he sat
down; and he listened and watched
with closest attention as Elviny, in her
turn, gracefully rose, and, placing the
tips of her fingers on her lips, coughed
genteelly before commencing to read:
"Single life is the happiest life that
ever was spent when you are single
you can go when you please and come
when you please and stay as long as
you please. When you are single you
have nothing on your mind still to
bother you. Single life Is the sweetest
life that was "ever spent.- When you
are single you can do as you please
you have nothing to bother your mind
at all."
Without so much as glancing toward
Amaziah to note the full effect of these
radical sentiments; Elviny complacent
ly resumed her seat. As for him, he
found himself co painfully surprised at
learning that such were the views of
the girl wJth whom he "kep steady
comp'ny" that he had no attention to
give to the remaining compositions of
the cIaES.
On their way- home from -school, in
the April afternoon sunshine, he ex
postulated with her. -.:,-.:
"Elviny," he said, reproachfully, as
side by side they walked on the high,
wide pike, "the way you spoke in that
composition, it was something shame
ful! I didn't think to hear you read off
such thoughts as them." â¢
"Och, don't be so dumb, Amaziah,"
Elylny said, poking him Impatiently
with her elbow. "A body don't haverto
mean everything that a person writes
off in a composition. I had to write off
somepin then, and it was so'warm.l
couldn't ' think what \u25a0" for thoughts ' to
\u25a0write. There for a while I had a mind
to put down how solemn if^ras to get
married. But then It came to me," shÂ«
said seriously, "how it would be a good
deal more solemn , not â¢to get married.
So I Just wrote off them thoughts
about single life/to get through once."
Amaziah's face lighted up with relief.
'Td have thought you meant it, and I
was now bothered something wonderful
already."

There had been a~ tacit" engagement of
marriage between these two ever since
four years before, when Elviny was 13
and Amaziah . 16. It had happened one
'summer evening^ while they had been
Bwinging together in a hammock by the
front gate of Elviny's home. She had
suddenly, and unexpectedly said to
Amaziah:
"Say, will you be mad if I tell you
something, Amaziah 7" ' .
"Naw!" in a tone of affectionate scorn
at the suggestion. "Let It out!"
"Sayâ l love you!"
"Awâ r knowed that already. Tou be
mad if I tell you somepln, Elviny?"
"No; go on; tell me oncet."
"I love you."
The understanding thus established
hadgrown clearer every day and hour
of the past four years.
"There's just or^y but one thing, El
viny, that I wlshtâ "
"Now, Amaziah, I know what you're
atâ you ' needn't say nothin' about
that!" Elviny tried to check him. "I
don't want to hear it!"
Amaziah set his Jaw obstinately. "It's
time me and you had this here thing
out and done with it," he affirmed. "I
like you better*n any girl in Canaan
district, but I ain't goin* to waste my
time settin* up Saturday evenings with
ft girl that's likely any day to give her
pelf up and put on them darned Noo
Mennonlte little white caps and gray
dresses with them foollsh-lookin* capes!
X know;them Noo Mennonltes!" he de
fiantly-exclaimed, his resolution to
â¢peak his mind at Its highest. Elviny
turned pale at his tone and look of de
termination.
"Tour folks is Noo Mennonites from
way % back to i your great grandfather
already, and when It's in a body's blood
that there way, they're bound to give
themselves< up sooner or laterâ unless
they promise they won't never! I'm
afraid of it for, you, Elviny."
"A body to hear you talk, Amaziah,
\u25a0would think it was the smallpox any
how, 'stid of religion!" Elviny almost
sobbed.' ;<>-..â¢
"Yes, and I'd anyhow as soon It was
the smallpox! Elviny, I'd as soon see
you dead as see your pretty face in one
of them darnedâ"
"Amaziah! I ain't goin' to listen to
no.sichtalkf- You speak something
shameful!" ; â¢-"'
"Well, I like you 'cause you're pretty,
and if you went and made yourself
ugly by wearin* them caps and capes
and. dull colors, and if you went and
turned plain and wouldn't never no
more go to town with me to see a cir
cus or a county fair or have our pho
\u25a0 tographs took or whatever, where'd be
any comfort for a feller In beln* mar
ried? Elviny, I tell you now, straight
forward, I don't want to be married to
no Noo Mennonlte. And if I ain't to
marry you, I. don't want to waste my
time settln' up with you Saturdays."
"Then you needn't! I guess I can
find' a plenty' others that wants to set
up with me." . .- iJ '\u25a0 â¢*
Amaziah's determined Jaw slightly
relaxed. But he he"ld out. "And I
guess, I ; can; mebbe find others that
wants -me 'to 'set up with 'em, JElviny,
so far forth as that goes," he* retali
ated.' ;
"You'll be keepln* comp'ny, I guess,
with Sally Haverstick then!"- crossly
said 'Elviny. :Â»
"It's very probable," he relentlessly
acknowledged, "unless you pass me
your promise you won't never, as long
as. you live, put on one of them little
white caps with ties."
"But, Amaziah, how can a body
tell â¢ whether :or no she'll ever coma
under conviction and be led to glvo
herself up?". Elviny reasoned with
.him. "I might never, mebbe. Then
again, I might any day. Yon might
mebbe some -time come under con
viction yourself. - A body, can't tell of
them things. I can't choose you in
stead of Christ, can I? I think you
are, now, onreasonable."
. "You pass me your promise you
won't never put on their little white
caps with stringsâ that's all I got . to
say. Anything you want me to prom
ise back, I'll say yes to. If you'll pass
me that promise, Elviny, I'll marry
you and be the best husband to you
that anybody kin."
Elviny knew full well the force of
these words,* for v Amaziah always
meant Just what he said, and always
stuck to It. Moreover, he would bo
fully able to carry out his promise to
be a good husband to her, for he was
the ; only son of a father who owned
three -large, rich farms, and was,
therefore, in the language of the
neighborhood, "well fixed."
"I tell you, Amaziah," Elviny said
brokenly, "how can a body make such
a promise like what that is? If ever
I came under conviction â "
"Then Join the Methodists or the
Baptists.' I pass it as my opinion that
there's good in all religions. You can
have religion without turnin' plain.
The Methodists stays fashionable after
they are' convicted of their sins."
"But If I was ever to come under
conviction, Amaziah, I couldn't never
hold to the things of the world no
more. It wouldn't be according to
Scriptures, deedn't it wouldn't," she
pleaded, with quivering lips. "Oh,
Amaziah!"
They had turned from the pike Into
the lane leading to Elviny's home,
and the girl suddenly stopped short
and leaned against the face, bent
her arm over : her eyes IlkÂ© a child
and sobbed. Amaziah's kindly face
twitched with sympathy for her trou
ble as he awkwardly stood before her.
"I guess you think I'm usin' you
mean, Elviny," he said, tenderly, but
with no relaxation of his firmness.
"But "it's for the happiness of us
both In ' the ! coming - future before us,
Elviny. I couldn't be contented mar
ried to no Noo Mennonlte. I couldn't
like you If you didn't dress and act
, fashionable like me." /:
. "But mebbe I'll never be called to
turn, plain," Elviny pleaded. "Mebbe,"
she said hopefully, "the spirit won't
never lead me to see the light."
"But 'then again' mebbe It will. I
ain't takln", no such risks. You pass
me yourâ here -comes your Momi"
The sudden appearance at the fence
of a stout woman holding, a dishpan
full of lettuce was the occasion of Ama
ziah's digression. . The woman, was
dressed in the "plain" garb of the New
Mennonitesâ a straight gathered' skirt,
an untrlmmed waist extending below
the belt, (to distinguish them from the
: Old. MennonltesJ whose basques end at
the :belt), a three-cornered cape of the
same material as. the gown.-and a little
white ;'cap; with flying ties. At a first
glance Mrs." Dlnklebergrer's face ap
peared to be commonplace enough, sto
lid/ heavy, uninteresting; but a closer
examination revealed In her otherwise
>dull{eyes a look :,that = only a deep ex
perience ;of life can give to any coun
tenance; that ; look "* which shows that
through some channel the soul has
sounded its own nether foundations and
i has . laid â¢ hold upon ; a Reality^ which
only .those who 'lose themselves in the
-larger life of the Divine can* ever find.
"Well," she said in a mild voice, !"arÂ»
yous home a'ready? It's only a quar
ter till four."
"We come right away out then," said
Elviny, speaking cheerf uly to hide the
signs- of her. weeping. "Ain't we did.
Amaziah? Are you pickln' the lettuce
for market. Mom?" .
"Yes, I thought I'd do It for Fop; than
it* would be done."
"Why didn't you wait till I corns to
help you through oncet? She does too
much still," she added explanatorily- to
Amaziah. "Ever since she had the pee-,
noo-mony it makes her so tired till she
gets the work through."
"Yes, I'll be glad when Elviny's dona
school oncet, so's she can help me stilL
We got such big washln's â till each haa
their pile, the wash Is big already.".
"That's what Mom says still," said
Amaziah sociably. "And she alnt no
daughter to help herâ only a dopplis
(awkward) hired girl."
"Well." said Mrs. Dinkleberger,. "I
got to go In now and make supper.
Won't you come in, Amaziah, and set a
while?"
"Saddy (thank you), but I cant Just
bo very convenient to-day. Good-by."
"Good-by, Amaziah. then."
Without looking at her lover, 'Elviny
took the books from his hands over
the fence.
"Promise. Elviny," he whispered, ej
he gave them to her. "Go on, dear!
That you won't never wear one of
them- "
Elviny shook her head, the tears ris
ing again to her eyes.
"You think It out and write me off
a note then," was his parting admoni
tion. And Elviny left him and hasten
ed after her mother.
Elviny had known from the first
that when Amaziah took that tons of
firmness with her she would. In the
end, do what he demanded of her. So
she was not surprised at herself when
that night, sorely against her con
science, she dispatched a note to him,
giving the promise that he ' had re
quired, namely,^ that she would "never
wear one of them little white caps
with ties," this particular feature of
the Mennonlte garb evidently standing
to him for a symbol of all the ascetic
ism, and narrowness of the New Men
nonites* life.
1 But Amaziah's Joy In his conquest
was short-lived. When two evenings
later, being Sunday, he betook himself,
clad in the "fashionable" apparel his
soul loved, to the home of hl3 sweet
heart, he found her so pale, bo silent,
so woebegone that he was stricken
\u25a0with remorse and sorrow for her.
They did not discuss or even mention
the painful subject of the promise; but
Amaziah felt convinced after a two
hours' fruitless endeavor to make her
"act sociable and pleasant." that poor
Elviny would never bÂ» "contented"
again with such a load of Â«in on her
conscience as that promise seemed
to be. .
"I wlsht I could see her lookin* con
tented "once again," he said to himself
orie Saturday evening, as, with little
pleasure In his visit/ ke walked up the
lane to her home.- "Blamed If I
wouldn't most be wlllln' to do any
thing to, see her lookln* contented
again."
He was destined to hayÂ« this gen
erous wish of his put to the test soon
er than he had* counted on. When,
ten minutes later, Elviny walked Into
her' parlor to receive him. he. knew.
In a flash such as seldom came to his
monotonous, slow moving ' mental life,
that never had he seen her more
beautiful than she appeared to his
eyes this night. She was robed as she
had never been before. A light gray
skirt hung straight from her waist,
and a plain, untrimmed, close fitting
basque brought out the beautiful
womanly development of her bust and
shoulders and was \u25a0 not concealed by
the little three-cornered cape that lay
over her basque. v.'.'V
The letter of her promise to Ama
ziah had been that she would "never
wear one of them white caps with
ties"â but, oh, the subtlety of the
daughters of Eve and the fatuity of
the sons of Adam! â an Indian mull
cap, not white, but of the faintest
shade of gray and havln* no ties, cov
ered her head.
' However, her "plain" clothes "wÂ«rÂ«
not the greatest change he found In
her. What was this new light In her
eyes that looked up at- him with such
deep happiness shining in their clear
beauty? A feeling of .awe fell upon
Amaziah. Had Elviny Indeed got re
ligion? - 'â¢â¢ _. ."\u25a0
"You see, Amaziah'*â he- heard her
soft voice speak as though coming from
a distance, for there was a loud slnj
ing in his head that kept him from
hearing her clearlyâ "I'm keepin* my
promise. I ain't wearin" one of them
little white caps with ties. ; This here's
a tinted gray- cap â¢ and ain't got no
ties. The scriptures haven't got noth
in' about the color nor the -ties., only
that a woman's head shall be covered
because her hair's a pride to her and
pleasing to the eye."
"Are you turned plain. EWarâ¢
Amaziah managed to ask la a half
whisper.
"I've give myself up. Amaziah," she
replied with pale-faced, dear-eyed .res- v
olutlon. "I ain't broke my promise to
you and never will. I'll always wear
these here tmted caps without ties to
'em. Now you have the dare to take
me or leave me be." ,â¢_*-.^.
"Are you contented again, Ehrtnyt"
"I never knowed before what happi
ness It was to be had In this here life.
It's all in servln* the Lord. Amaziah.
I had such a troubled conscience â It
was now a wonderful troubled con
science I had this here while back- al
ready. ' And my fashionable clothes
they condemned me something turrlble.
But it's all over now, Amaziah. " I've
give myself ud and* I'm dressln' plain,
and I'll never walk no \u25a0 more In the
paths of this world." .* j '\u25a0'
Elviny slowly revolved herself for In
spection. When her back was toward
him. Amaziah measured her shapely
form with his masculine eye, then sud
denly put his arms about her and held
her close to his breast. *
."It becomes you something surpris
ing Elviny!" he whispered ecstatically.
"You never looked as pretty before.
And I never liked you as good as what
I do to-night!" â.,_.;.
She turned in his arms and laid her
head on his shoulder, with a long, hap
py sigh of relief. -He pressed his lips
to her soft neck and" downy cheek.
"But well have to be married soon,
Amaziahâ before I Join meeting-, you
know. For after I'm once Joined, I
r can't marry In the world, no more. And
you're In the world, you know. So we'll
have to be married soon."
"All right. Elviny," \u25a0\u25a0 Amaziah heartily
responded. - "I'll make it suit Just aa
soon as I otherwise can! We'll be mar
ried till the back end of August al
ready!"CYNICAL moralizers upon

then the waste basin should have some
thing placed in the bottom to hold back
all clogging stuff, or that pipe may get
choked. An ordinary wire sieve net In
over the opening, or an old colander,
will answer the purpose. Uhey can be
lifted as often as necessary -and the dust
and refuse collected therein sent below
lo the garbage can. But if there be no
euch place convenient for the workers
to use, they will have to go to the bath
room, for the steps of day-by-day toil
ers should always be considered and no
more imposed upon them than the ex
igencies of the occasion demand. There
fore, if the bath room must be open to
them, every mean* should be employed
to protect It from Injury.
KEEP PLUMBEBS AWAY
Bciorv any cleaning begins the floor.
If of bard ur -'.-.lned wood, ought to be
covered with strong paper fastened
down to keep it Immovable .under the
treading of leet. There is a stout dark
paper which comes in rolls for protect
ing tioors during cleaning times, always
used by bkillcd floor polishers, that
bears very hard usage without tearing.
This paper is the best thing that the
vnter knows of ior such occasions. The
bathtub and the basin can both be pro
tected by placing Jn each, over the
waste exit, the ii.-ta rubber mats that
come for that purpose. Upon these pails
caa stand without marring the porce
lain or marble.
Waste water should never be thrown
luto a bathtub because it makes ex
m.ordinary .waning frequently neces
sary lo prevent staiuing the tub. What
ever place may be chosen for getting, rid
of the dirty water during cleaning times,
vigilance will be requisite to avoid chok-

SCHOOL FOR HOUSEWIVES
floors as "troublesome" Lcyond the
capacity of housemothers of moder
ate means.- They must be swept
twice a week, we are told, and dust
ed daily, if one would keep one's
bouse decent. Putting . aside, the
question as to the composite nature
of the dust removed, and which
would, if left "in a woolen carpet,
find its way gradually, but surely,
into the lungs and stomachs' of those
who walk, sit and sleep in the rooms
thus made "comfortable," let us rea
son together over this same obliga
tion of sweeping.
A soft hair broom is usually sold
for this purpose. I find a stiff,
Etauncb, rather brpad besom of the
regulation broomcorn variety, cov
ered with a snug bag of red flannel,
altogether the best agent in the
work.. It is as easily handled as a
cloth * duster; it may be i untied,
drawn off and washed when soiled;
and it does not- scratch the polished
surface of the floor.
The rugs,' be they cheap. or expen
sive, should be lifted and shaken
once a week, then laid upon . the
grass and swept on both sides.. After
which leave them lying on 'the grass,
if you have a patch of turf. If you
are a flat-dweller, let shaking, sweep
ing and sunning be done upon the
housetop or in a .vacant lot. or in a
to hold back the malted stuff that com
monly collects at' tnose limes. This is
one of many instances uuring house
cleamug wneii the proverbial uuuee of
prc-vei.iion bpares t>ome one pounds,
shillings and pence of expense lor cure.
An early call uponâ and -f mmâ the
pluiaber tor repairs .is not invariably
fraught with unalloyed- pleasure to a
houbenold, either immediately or- when
the inevitable" bill is presented ior pay
ment. Far better, by a little forethougnt
-and' painstaking, avert iiustiuc mischief
than experience- the - -vexatious, conse
quences ot one'js own omission to safe
guard exposed places. . It is "childish to
blame others lor; damage occurring be

"We" cook an even cupful of raw ncs

water for about twenty minutes, giving
the saucepan a sharp shake now and
then to keep the rice from sticking to
the bottom or sides. When it is tender,
which wo ascertain by biting Into a

the open vessel of rice is set at the sid<Â»
of the range to dry off. And every grain
of our rice has a separate and distinct

When sitting in a chair be sure to
have him tied in carefully and place
a soft pad or pillow at his back to give
him a little support. He will enjoy ex

The Courtesies - Giving Dinner Party
Following Old Beliefs, the Modern Hostess
Finds This a Popular Way to Entertain
ELEANOR B. CLAPP
CopjTicht. 1306. by A. S. Barnes & Co.
"All human history &ttefct3
That happiness for manâ the hungry sinnerâ
J-ir.ce Eve etc apples, much depends on dinner!'
â Hyron.
V'Â»7 > jrITH modern society one of the
I\ V / most popular of all forms of
YY entertaining is the giving of
dinner parties. For this there
arc many good and sufficient reasons.
I While accepting with a very large
"grain of salt" the old adage that "Th<*
way to a man's heart is thrcuch his
stomach," the matron of to-day agrees
thoroughly, with Byron that "much de
pends on dinner." Anil accordingly she
puts forth all her efforts to make her
table the best spread and most con
penial "board" known to her immediate
R coterie "of friends.
The Invitations.
"First catch your bare" begins the
famous old. recipe Tor Jugged hare, so
in giving a dinner party first invite
>our friendsâ be sure you choose people
who will be congenialâ and then, having
received their acceptances, sit down and
*}\u25ba: aref ully think out your menu.
The Invitations to a dinner are sent
out on engraved cards or by written
notes, and are always Issued In the
name 'of both host and hostess. Cards
can get hold of into his mouth. If
the child has never had the thumb
sucking habit, be careful that he docs
not form it now. Should he show a
tendency to do it, put a small bag on
his hand or dip his thumb In a solution
of quinine or aloes.
A piece of cardboard bound on the
arm, and long enough to reach a little
above and below the elbow so that the
arm cannot be bent, will often prove
an effective means of preventing thumb
sucking when other methods fail. The
habit of thumb suckins is not only an
ugly one, but it spoils the shape of the
mouth and finger.
A special cracker is now made in the
form of a ring; it is quite hard and is
composed largely of malt sugar and is
Intended for teething babies to bite on.
As they can get very little, if anything,
off of it, such a cracker will do no
harm and may be given to the baby in
preference to ivory or rubber rings,
which often do more harm than good
by hardening the gums and so making
it more difficult for the teeth to push
their way through them.
If the baby "drools" much, he is apt
to quickly wet through any little bib he
may wear, and so take cold by having
damp clothing next to his chest. A
material now made, which is water
proof, but not so heavy as rubber and
without the odor rubber is apt to have,
may be very useful at this time. If .a
piece of it is cut the shape of the bib
and bound with tape, it may then be
worn underneath the bib and prevent
the clothing from becoming^ wet.
arc used when the dinner is to be a
large and formal one, notes when It Is to
be a small and what is termed "quiet"
dinner. For the former cards are sent
out a fortnight, and even three weeks,
beforehand, while to the latter an Invita
tion of from five to ten days is consid
ered sufficient notice. Dinner or luncheon
invitations, above all others, must be an
swered promptly, and guests must ar
rive punctually at the hour, mentioned
in the invitation; To be late to dinner
is a crime not easily pardoned by so
ciety.' And after a would-be guest has
once sent an acceptance to an invita
tion to a feast he must go, unless some
thing -very grave and important hap
pens to prevent. Hen.cc the old society
quip that nothing but death must keep
one from a dinner party, and if one's
demise Inopportunely intervenes the ex
ecutor must be sent to Gil the vacant
chair. *
A daintily spread table, with' sparkling
glass, glittering silver and pretty floral
decorations, tends not only to the en
joyment of the guests, but to the! suc
cess of the dinner; and these things, de
pend upon tho hostess, who should super
intend the arrangements of, the dinner
table personally, and riot leave it to the
care of a servant unless sure that the
servant can be perfectly relied upon.'

mother and aunts and loving friends
'pour into his .lap all kinds of treasures
for his comfort' and joy. 'His thoughtful
mother thinks of his comfort -first, arid
her own incidentally, and- supplies* Nur
sery Land first with useful things. The
centre of all toilet functions is the baby
basket. This fluffy creation of pink or
blue has its pincushions and pockets.
Baskets just like it belonged to mother
and grandmother in olden days., And
baskets just like It probabjy will belong
to daughter and granddaughter in days
to come. Among the dainty things that
belong to the present is, an article that
has to dp. with, his .first experiences of
discipline. It is aribbon contrivance to
tie him In bed. About four yards of one
inch ribbon is used. A little belt is made
to go around his body, fastened with, a
pearl button.' There are two or three
buttonholes, so that when baby grows
fatter there still /.will be . room. From
each side of the belt extend two straps
of ribbon, about, twelve Inches long.; At
each end of these,' two strands of ribbon
are sewed, with which the little prisoner
is tied, to his bed. One, of the sweetest
accessories to a baby girl's lingerie is a
pair of tiny garters. These are bands
of one-fourth-inch rubber r,un through
a casing of one-half-inch ribbon, with
little bows, a dear littie "miniature of
mother's own. . . . â¢
Dainty- and Useful.
One of mother's, greatest comforts is
a ribbon roli. Ut is practically a spool,
its dimensions being about : three inches
by one-half iiuch..,. The sides are covered
with white china silk, on which is paint
ed the daintiest of flowers. In : the cen
tre is a bow of baby ribbon, from which
comes one long strand bearing an Ivory
bodkin. This is an 1 almost indispensable
part of baby's layette. 'Another help is a

Recording Baby's Progress.
There are not many mothers to whom
every step in the baby's growth is not
profoundly important. A record of his
every little happening is very dear to
her. She can prepare for herself some
thing to hold this precious story.' It is a
booklet whose covers are white linen,
held together by white ribbon. On the
front is painted a water scene; stand
ing among the reed 3 are ' two. storks,
which, arp- embroidered in while silk.
The leaves of the book are feather-edge
linen paper, with the headings of each
page drawn in ink. The Sheadings run
Komethins in this wise: ; Baby's birth

Weight. Baby's Height, "arid all . the
things that <he mother deems worthy

the ribbons'that the- covers. A
pretty idea is to paint in water color
on the fly leaf a mirror. \
, The first of baby's play times begin in
the nursery, -and . they come very early.
Some things .quite befitting his ; station

Photography. .'â¢â¢\u25a0
An acquaintance of mine, up in Ver
mont, became ; quite proficient in ama
teur photography: .She, had two cam
eras,', and took great pride in completing
-sail the work herself. Her- husband. was
a traveling man. and she spent most of
her time when with him taking pic
tures that she developed at home.. Some
of these turned out real works of art.
- When her husband was thrown from a
car and killed she had to hold a sale of
pictures in order to, pay the debts in
curred by the funeral. Her only^talent
seemed to be photography. Still, she did
not set up' a shop and run in debt wait
ing for people, to come to her. She hired
a boy to carry her traps, -and then she
took up -the house-to-house : canvassing.
She offered : to take views of the
homes, Inside and out.. This led to group
pictures for fun, pictures of the- chllr
dren, which qf ten called in .large orders
because they seemed more natural than
gallery pictures." - '
Whenever V she.": saw a child on the
street that she thought would make a
pretty "picture, she snapped it and sent
a proof to the'mother, saying'she would
furnish; the pictures 'at sol much a
dozen. She made a thriving business in.
one little town", where. she happened to
take the picture of a servant girl with
her beau out. Walking.'* "Every girl In
town want^a a . picture 'after that,
whether she had a beau or not.
! Photographing on Cloth.
..She carried her photograph work into
doing printing oh' cloth, making'pin
cushions of the print of some noted
home and selling them at fairs. Per
haps she used the very cliurch in which
the fair was givenâ such made a par
ticularly good souvenir. :
..This fancy article photography leads
one to making pillows,- 'table -covers,
"scarfs, bags, etc., by ornamenting. them
with the blue prints.
The rules'; for making . these priqts^ on
cloth "are furnished me'; by -MrB.' : jMc-.'" :
Clary,''"of \u0084Malone,-N.\ V., ; who spends
much of her leisure time making: thqso^
things, then donating them' to - thÂ»
churches for their sales.
Use fine cambric for* printing. 'For,.
sensitizing four yaVda f * of- cambric, dis
solve-In 8 ounces of. water . 17s ounces
citrate of iron and ammonium. Then
dissolve 1U ounces of potassium ferricy
anide.in another, S ounces of water; mis
the 'two together- when ready :to use.
\u25a0 It, is wise to have the cambric cut into
Coil's Weekly Cartoon! on American Society
sizes needed, for it i 3 so much easier to
handle. When the cloth is fully satu
rated, lift it out with a stick and pin
up In a dark place to dry. The mixture
is poisonous; don't get your fingers into
it more than is necessary. When dry put
the cloth in some box proof to the light.
In sensitizing the cloth work in a room
lighted only with a small lamp. Print
as you would from any negative, using
the cloth instead of paper. When printed
rinse the picture three or four times in
scalding hot water, then leave it about
five minutes in cold water. Iron dry
with a hot iron, placing the print be
tween two sheets of white paper.
These things are liked in the country,
where* ft is hard to take time to go to
a photographer. With a lot of this
sensitized cloth, a good camera and a
quick eye for catching pretty as well as
funny poses, a woman can even utilize
the workers in the hay field, churchgo
ing people or Sunday picnickersâevery
body will want a picture when he once
sees the proof and finds his face In It.
Charge from 25 to 50 cents each. Color
some, mount some and frame others.
Often the frame attracts as much as
the picture.
Transparent Colors of
the Japanese
AN OLD idea is often very new to
some people. Here is one that, if
the amount of interest the public
takes in It Is to be considered, is
new to the majority of people, namely,
the Peerless transparent water colors,
for the amateur's use.- They can be used
for tinting photographs, lantern slides,
half-tones, magazine prints and process
work of .all kinds where a perfectly
transparent color is required. They
come in a booklet, the colors by somÂ»
secret, process being spread over a leaf
let In concentrated form. All that is
needed Ss to cut off strips from the vari
ous tipts as required for the work In
hand, place in sufficient water, to dis
solve-the color film from the leaflet,
and then add water to bring the color
to the desired strength. The colors are
immediately soluble in water; so it all
.is a simple matter. They flow smootSiiy
and combine perfectly* making an in
finite number of - shades. The art of
J f ransparent tinting had Its origin In
Japan, and the wonderful skill of th~e
Japanese artists in this line Is well
known and admired everywhere. For
the amateur these colors have. an ad
vantage over the bottled inks and colors
in cakes, porcelains, etc., for they are
so easily handled; and they have no
sediment when laid on. For. the woman
who ; would ' add attractive pictures hÂ«re
and there In some needy spot on the
wall, or who would make little gift 3 of
calendars, blotters and what not. here
rP a delightful way to do It. An attrac
tive picture from a magazine, or a Perry
picture, or 'a Cosmos picture "may be
beautifully colored, so that the only ex
pense will be the frame. "The amateur
photofirrapher will delight her friends if
she colors some of, the iportraits this
way. One of the children's great de
lights Is picture books. If, the mother
colors these' pictures the work becqme3
a three-fold treasure in the child's eyes.NAME PUZZLES

IS THE BIGGEST CATCH
IN MATRIMONIAL OCEAN
Young Lord Howard de Walden Has Income of More Than
$1,000,000 a Year and His Record Is Clear.
Â£j>cclal Cable to The CalL
LONDON, Oct. 14. â There was rather
a special interest about the recent ac
quisition of "Audley End," the historic
and splendid Tudor mansion, in Essex,
by Lord Howard de Walden. It led one
to speculate as to whether an American'
girl might not eventually succeed "in
â¢ marrying this nobleman, who, though
he is only 25, and has been rarely men
tioned in the newspapers,' has spent the
last few years of his life in dodging ,
attempts to lure him into matrimony.
For by thus providing himself with" a
country seat worthy to rank with the
London palace which he owns in Bel
grave square, this youthful peer has
done the last thing necessary to make
himself pre-eminently \tlie greatest
"catch" in the world to-day. And isn't
it acknowledged that most of the other
greatly desired bachelors of ' recent
years have finally capitulated to. fair
daughters of the Stars and 'Stripes?,
To exaggerate the attractions of Lord
Howard de Walden, considered "from "a
matrimonial standpoint, would be rath
er difficult. For besides possessing
good looks, a historic ancestry, and that
rare thine in a youthful member of the
British peerage," an absolutely clean
record, this young nobleman has be
come one of the , richest men in all
Europe. He owns huge estates In Not
tinghamshire and Ayrshire, and It Is
now estimated that he owns more valu
able land in London than the young'
Duke of Westminster, who always has
been held to be the greatest of London
landlords, and as such, has been the
subject of endless columns of gossip.
Lord Howard de Walden's . recently
acquired pre-eminence Is due, partly to
the fact that his London, possessions in
clude many acres In the Harnpstead
which Is getting more and
more popular as a place of residence;'
but it is the square -mile of real estate
that he owns in the Marylebone district
that can be described as a veritable El
dorado. Besides aristocratic Cavendish
square with its ducal mansions, this
estate includes Harley street, \u25a0where all
the most eminent and fashionable Lon
don doctors have their abiding places,
and a doien more thoroughfares whose
names mean almost as much in this
country.' From this property alone the
young bachelor's income is between
$1,000,000 and $1,500,000 a year. What
his total income is It would be- rash
to guess â and he himself probably
would be the last to try to guess.
OTHER QUALIFICATIONS.
Besides being the eighth Baron How
ard de Walden, this youthful peer Is
Baron Seaford. Moreover he is "Supe
rior" of the Scotch town of Kllmarnock,
a large slice of which is Included In
his si Ayrshire estate," this title being'
equivalent to that of Lord of the Manor
in England. He is; an ex-lieutenant of
the swagger Tenth Regiment' of Hus
sars, w^tb whom he went 'to the South
African war. He is one of the most
prominent breeders of racehorses in
this country. His steam yacht, "the
Highwayman," Is one of the finest
afloat. Perhaps, however, apart from
his vast wealth, Howard de Walden is
most interesting as a "catch" on ac
count of, the two superb mansions of
which W is now the proprietor. *
The flrs\ of these, "Seaford House,"
in Belgrave square, now disputes with
Stafford House, the magnificent resi
dence of. the Duke and : Duchess of
Sutherland, the honor of being the fin
est private residence In London. .It
was bought .by Howard de .Walden in
1900, or about six months after the
unexpected sudden / death' of his
father changed!' the young man,' ,. who ;

had barely attained 'his majority, from
plain Thomas. Evelyn Ellis ' Esq. , to., the.
holder of ' two | baronies and one' of the
rlchetft; noblemen ''in # 'Europe. ''.The man
sion was then "Sef ton . House," andThad
previously been one of . the best known,
as well aa" one 'of 'the largest pf London
mansions.. Its, owner, the' Countess of
Sef ton, held a' salon that was', famous
for its brilliance. When, however, her
only ' son came to grief in a steeple
chase and. became an '-Invalid for- life,
the -Countess ' retired into", the country
to be with him, and for several; years
her. great .town house remained closed.
When Lord' Howard; de* Walden
bought "Seaford House.", as. lie renamed
it, /he found it ,' full . of moldy leather
chairs and other* relics' of ; early- Vic
torian, tastelessness, :but' in -less/than
five months he had transformed it In a
way that Monte ' Cristo himself ! might
have .'envied.'. Now the feature- of the
place is : its superb \ marble staircase.
The stone used in. its construction' tones
! from ; palest sea_ green to "deepest emer
ald, and was brought from South Africa
at great ; expense. ;. The; column's ' of the
staircase are of Mexican: alabaster. "The
painted 'ceilings'. of !' "Seaford House? are
models of artistic decoration, whilethe 1
furniture is entire .French. -
GOIXG DOWNSTAIRS BED.
Perhaps the oddest thing about"Aud
ley End," Howard" de .Walden's stately
new. country,,seat,ywhlch he leases from
Lord Braybrooke, is ; the "fact, that- the
guests he entertains, there have. to. go
downstairs,' instead iof- upstairs, to bed!
This is accounted -for^by, the- fact "that
in' this.o ld: Tudor mansion 'the. state
apartments are on \ the' -second 'floor,
while the' bedrooms are. on, the- ground,
floor. -The* .grounds , are" vast,' -and) to
look after "them and .the -flower-beds,
Howard de Walden "employs 'fifty ; gar- ,
deners, twenty of whom confine their
attention to the blooms and vegetables!
which, he raises under, glass.; ' i
With two such establishments, not to
jnention a few, millions-at< her com- I
mand, - the -future .Lady -Howard de !
AValden ought to be fairly I .'
In addition/ however,, she will probably j
one day; come into.- about: the finest
collection of, jewelry-, in this country.
This is now: the property, of ' Howard de
Waldcir"s .mother, .who -is LadyVLudlow
by her second 1 marriage,; and' Is one of
the handsomest women: in ,< the land.
She it is who entertains for him when
ever there is a blg.partyat either Sea
ford : House or Audley, End,' and a- most
charming chatelaine she-, makes. Her
ladyship, -who was Blanche. Holden be
,fore she married the late Lord Howard
de Walden, did not have an . especially
happy time with that, nobleman; in fact,
she secured a legal separation from him
immediately a^ter their : 'sori was born.
But she, and "the present Howard de
Walden are devoted to each j other, and
before her ,. marriage to Lord Ludlow,
two years ag6, they used to be seen
continually dining" or lunching together
at the" best ."restaurants; where stran
gers generally 'took them for brother
and sister.- â¢\u25a0 \u25a0 â¢ \u25a0â¢ \u25a0 ; '\u25a0
â¢ The young bachelor peer is about the
most ".baffling proposition with which
match-making mammas and chaperones
on this, side .of the- water- ever have
had to deal. and perhaps this is partly
due'to the intention which he has often
expressed^ .of waiting â until he found
a, woman^Just;like his. mother before
hemarrled; â¢ In' society; however, it is
affirmed : that Lady herself will
choose: her son's bride. With the pos
sible exception- of the Duchess of Port
land, no. English peeress can vie with
.LadyLudlbw,'. so: far as jewels are con
cerned; -Most' of her priceless- collec
tion; of gems 'came- to her when she
married : her first husband. Her emer-
I aids are of. really barbaric splendorand
she -possesses' sufficient --to cover an
entire corsage.- In fact, when her en
gagement' to \u25a0 Lord Ludlow; -was 'an- I
nouriced,' the former Lady Howard de f
Walden begged her. friends on no ac- ',
count to 'send her jewels, as she "slm- '
ply did not know what to do with those '
she already possessed." And it goes f-

The American author" of "The Life of

more than any Englishman to reveal
to England the full measure of her in

also commended. the scheme. Â£"l should

DISPLAYS -OF PATRIOTISM.. '"\u25a0''
The anniversary will, of course, call
forth' many 'displays of patriotism . In
various parts of the empire, but they
will be in' the main of a pacific charac
ter. At Trafalgar, England annihilated
the combined j fleets of France' j and
Spain. A r grand naval review, which
would exhibit England's naval .'might
and power, would seem to be the, most
fitting celebration of the of
her. greatest sea victory and the. death
of her greatest sea hero. It would cer
tainly be most; popular, with;the jin-.
goes. But the entente .cordiale; had to
be taken into \u25a0 consideration. Gallic
pride is sensitive and Trafalgar/ day is
a day<_ of humiliation for France.
Therefore, if has . been ' decided, -that
there, shall be 'nothing in ' the various
celebrations which can hurt.'the feel

of Ab'ercorh, she Intends to give some
thing unique In the way of a fancy dress
ballâ something that will be talked about
as much as was Mrs. Bradley Martin' 3
famous ball. The latter did not make
at all the sort of hit Mrs. Bradley Martin
had fondly anticipated. It was derided
as a vulgar and ostentatious exhibition of
wealth. Preachers denounced it. As far
as the ambitious hostess is concerned it
simply represented a great waste of
money. Because of the comments made
on It, Instead of helping her it hurt her
socially. But the ambitious Chicago
woman has much more tact and good
taste than her compatriot. Her enter
prise will be so managed that it will not
lay her open to the same charge. Besides
she will have the assistance of her friend.

plained points that were not clear to
the members, spoke at great length on
the subject of retaining the membership

of neglect to pay dues. On a number of
these visits the groves manifested Inter

that this jurisdiction will call upon the
entire membership for a loan, a popu
lar loan in small monthly advances to
be applied to the payment of outstand
ing claims, so that all obligations can
be met In a comparatively short space
of time. If this Idea is carried out the
amount advanced will be repaid to?the
lenders in the reduction of monthly
assessments and it is believed that the
loyalty of all the members will be such
that the order instead of being called
upon jto borrow money from money
lenders, for which it would have to
pay a high rate of. interest; can borrow
the amount required from the members
and in, that way place the order in a
much better condition than it has been
for many years. -The Idea will be
worked out by the advisory board and
in a short time will be presented to all
the members in the jurisdiction. The
money due by the supreme body which
would place the Jurisdiction "on vel
vet" is sure to come in and in a short
time all Indebtedness will be Uqul
dated.

Merely Mr. Zangwill in the drama of
this week is not wholly inspiring con
sideration. The second of Mr. Zang
wiirs efforts to be seen here,
Mary Ann," is now on the local market.
The first. 'The Children of the Ghetto,"
was given here some few years ago â
chiefly memorable, one remembers, for
a superb picturing of the rabbi therein
by Wilton Lackaye. Â«: ,
"Merely Mery Ann" was one of the
successes of the season before last in
London. Thfs was followed by a palmy
career in New* York in all of ten
In neither place did the ram
~pajit puerilities of Mr. Zangwill's play
excite more than passing note. There,
es here, the charm of Eleanor Robson
carried the play, nor to forget the cap
ital contributions of Ada Dwyer and
the rest of the company. But minus
these how does the play sum up? In
the central character the dramatist
achieves a Quaint triumph. The figure
is new to the stage and charming as it
is new. But one figure does not make
a play. Mary Ann is Mr. Zangwill's
one full-length portrait. Lancelot is
tho coat and trousers only of an irre
sponsible genius â plucklly filled by
the way, by H. B. Warner. The char
acter of Peter has many possibilities,
almost completely discounted again by
the scatterful handling. And these are
the chief people of the play. After
Mary Ann the most realistic figure is
that of the landlady, touched in quite
shrewdly by the dramatist. The
daughter is another neat bit. But the
rest of the people are puppets. In im
agination one sees them like the fam
ily washing, dangling legs and arms
i' the sun in a sweet and separate in
rtependence.
For it is here that Mr. Zangwill most
shrewdly fails. Not welded together
by blest* or damnable chance, one char
acter helplessly reacting upon another,
as in true drama, do his puppets ap
pear. In fact their grouping not in
frequently suggests an Orpheum olio,
turn by turn. Nor in this only is the
Orpheum suggested. Vaudeville of the
Cear. deadest days contained no com-
If-ncr spectacle than that of the ab-
person besprinkling things
with a siphon, that Lancelot indulges.
la. This would not be so ill had not
I'eter, Just, before this, absent mindedly
tioused the carpet with hot tea, and.
three times over, ochone! that the joke
might sink in.
The music lesson scene is more vaude
ville. The way of the composer (6tage)
is hard, yet one would imagine Mr. Zang
will's inevitable acquaintance with the
breed would have taught him better here.
Mr. Warner as the composer frankly
plays the scene as vaudeville, gnashing
his teeth and massaging his locks in
true "variety" rage. There Isn't any
thing else to do. Nor is there anything
else to do in Lancelot's turns with Mary
Â» Ann's canary. '\u25a0 a hardworking bird that
begins' to sing whenever no one else is
"on." Mr. Zangwill gives him here var
ious apostrophes of the "so true!" sort,
and Mr. Warner brings distinct heroism
to their appropriately sentimental dcliv-
Vaudeville, symbolism, fantasy, farce,
and some moments of genuine and de
lightful comedy would seem to be the pre
scription for "Merely Mary Ann." There
Is quite a Maeterlinckian note â over
worked â In the maid-servant's handing the
pen to the composer. But as before said
it happens too often. So do most of
Mr. Zangwill's little themes. Nor is the
dialogue particularly luminous; yet Mr.
Zangwill can write a scintillant line like
the landlady'sâ as Lancelot "gives no
tice": "What! you want a clean towelâ
a.nd leaving to-morrow!" But the charm
W his Mary Ann, as acted by Miss Rob
*Â«oa. and the heroic value of the rest of
the company may be imagined, when it
can be said that the play almost con
tinuously entertains. The little maid-ser
vant, from her soft "Zumxnerzet" burr,
to her gentle, tired slouch, is wholly cap
tivating. Humble without servility, stur
dily self-respecting, practical and still
with dreams, innately a lady, unworldly
honest and sweet, she is one of the most
attractive of recent stage folk and all
ways delicious in Miss Robson's exquisite
interpretation.
Miss Dwyer' s landlady is as good, with
her shabby gentility, her sordldness, her
kindness, her pretentiousness, her lovely
bourgeois piety all portrayed with sub
lime naturalness. So the cast, through
out. But Mr. Zangwill has not yet
threatened the fame of a Pinero, not by
what Mr. Britt calls "a Jugful."

Distinctly one for us Is New York's re

j one of Henry Miller's sumptuous seasons,
i when Miss Anglin so startlingiy discov
j ered her particular genius. New York
Jater saw that "Camille," with an almost
: identical cast. It is amusing hiow to re
: call what was said of it. The consensus
I of the critical opinion was that the play
I was eld-fashioned and that Miss Anglin
j looked odd in a black wig. '\u25a0 Perdie, we
could have told them that. too. But
; there was just the much more that they
j have now discovered (with naive pride)
| then a-smok'e under their critical nos-
I trlls.
However, it is in "Zira" that New York
â¢ has discovered Margaret Anglin. With
j "Wra" Henry Miller opened on Septem
j bcr 22 a stock season at the Princess
j Theater, with a company that reminds irr
\u25a0 caliber of hiE famous companies here?
i The play will be remembered. It is the
I free adaptation of Wllkie Collins' " book
| "The New Magdalen," done by Henry
j Miller and J. Hartley Manners, that had
j its first production during Miss AngJin's
j lecent season at the Caliiornla. It will
j be remembered that Hester Trent (Zira)
1 takes the name of a woman that she sup
i poses to be dead, killed In the Boer war,
and makes her home in England â¢ with
the people to whom the other woman was
going. The other woman recovers. She,
jat length reaches England. She finds
I Zira in possessionâ in possession of both
! position and money that should be hers.
| Love, also, has come. The two meet.
i Zira pleads that she may be permitted
!to go away undisgraced. ' The other
j woman refuses, hardly, bitterly. It is
| then that Miss Anglin's first big scene
'comes. Zira dares the woman to tell
j her story and succeeds in making good
I her word against the real niece of the
i house. Miss Anglin must have topped
' that scene for the New Yorkers as she
â¢ topped it for us,' when, after' its almost
: unbearable strain, she plunged into the
| further heart-wrenching of tne confes-
I Eion. At least they say, practically what
j was said here, that that twenty minutes
\u25a0 makes the play great.
Henry \u2666 Miller made Miss Anglin's
; speech after it. The Dramatic *-.rror
j gives it that "he .hoped this meant not
! only an Indorsement of their sincere at
| tempt to form a stock company of actors,
[ not starsâ which is a very different
I thÂ«ng â but also that it was a proof of
> Miss Anglin's place as an artist after
I the biggest .power in the theatrical world
! â who has 'now outlived his usefulness â
had boasted openly that there was no
further use for Miss Anglin as an actress
in New York. I submit the question to
the public," Mr. Miller left it-
Prank Worthing, Fred Thome, George
! S. Tltheradge, Jameson Lee Finney, J. R.
j Crauford. Harrington Reynolds, Beverly
j SRgreaves and Mrs. Thomas Whiffen are
) of the company, and to these and Mr.
| Miller's consummate stage handling even
j lavish praise, has been given.
i One would like to hear of "The Eternal
i Feminine" in New York. It has not been
I done there yet. Certainly Robert M'isch's
j delicious comedy was of. the particular de
! lights of Miss Anglin's last season here.
J One wonders, too, what they might have
j to cay of Margaret Anglin in "Mariana."
j Some of us here liked neither the play
! nor Miss Anglin in it. â¢ I liked both. But
i. Miss Anglin's Mariana weara a black

Will Sing Carmen
Quite alluring !s the air of mystery
that surrounds the' appearance of Alice
Colman, who ventures on. a Carmen at
the Tivoli next Wednesday, -evening.'
Miss Colman is a San Francisco girl,
suspected of extreme (operatic) youth,
a product of , Europe in h,er artistic
studies, and with some' European "ex
perience on the operatic. stage.. She
comes forward very ; modestlyâ &6 far
as one can follow. Calve, Collamarlni,
De Lussan in this famous ; role with
modesty â and hopes only - v for a ' fair
judgment on her performance. . Pos
sibly Miss Colman has 'begun at the
top of the hard {hings operatic that,
she misrn^ have attempted.' here. The
role of Carmen is easily .more; familiar
here than any other, and the partisans
of its exponents at least as â strenuous
as those of Partridge and Schmitz.
But the more danger, the more glory,
and one cannot but hope that the
young San Franciscan shall* turn-; out
another Calveâ or Collamarlni 'as you
will. The house to greet her will.be
a record to the 'local '.curiosity concern
ing Carmen. Miss, Colman is-. * the
daughter of Charles Colman, a well

EARL OF TAMvEKVILLE
OX STOOL OP PEXITEXCB
British Nobleman Who Fell From Grace
.Makes Ills, Heap pea ranee as a
RWlvnltst.
LONDON, October 14â There is great re
joicing-in evangelical circles over the Earl
of Tankerville's reappearance as a revi
valist. At the beginning of the- year the
pious associates of his earlier outpour
ings of religious zeal were greatly ahock
ed^ by his impenitent acknowledgment
that he had told Dr. Lunn he could "go
and be dâ d." What made it the mora
reprehensible was the fact that Dr. Lunn
had himself been a prominent missionary
exhorter before he found a more profita
ble field for the exercise of his persua
sive talents, In the establishment of a
tourist agency. It was that latter enter
prise which led to a split between him.
and the Earl. Dr. Lunn conceived me
brilliant idea of chartering a liner for a
cruise in the Mediterranean under the
auspices of a band of peers, and at rates
commensurate, with the exalted rjciety
that would be enjoyed by purchasers of
tickets.' Lord Tankerville accepted the
chairmanship of the tour and rive state
rooms for himself and wife. A newspa
per, greatly lacking in respect for coro
nets, disclosed the scheme, and made
some caustic comments on "titled touts."
Thereupon Lord Tankerville declared
that the use of his name had been
unauthorized. Dr. Lunn sought a. retrac
tion and got the big "D."
Since then the noble Earl has been re
garded as | a backslider by. many Non
conformists. His return to the revivalist
fieM Is accepted as proof of his repent
ance and restoration to grace. It la sus
pected that his American wifeâ formerly
Miss VanMarter of Tacomaâ had no lit
tle to. do with bringing about this happy
result. She is participating in the open
air mission which he/is conducting in
Shropshire and delivers addresses at
them. Lord Tankerville was at one time
associated with Moody. It is said that
he sings hymps almost as effectively as
did Sankey. I
BRITISH OFFICERS LOSE
MANY RICH PERQUISITES
Naval Reform* Do Away With Free
Furniture for Men Who Com- -
maad King Edward's Shins.
LONDON. Oct. 14. â There is & good
deal of heartburning among naval offi
cers, owing to one reform which, the
admiralty has Just announced and
which it is meant to carry but at once.
This has reference to the extraordinary
system under which officers of the fleet
from time immemorial have been sup
plied with furniture.
When a war ship goes into commis
sion she Is fitted by the dockyard au
thorities with all the necessary f urnl- .
ture. both in her Jiving and sleeping
Quarters, as well as with mess plate.
At I the expiration of tho commission
the Government plate is sold by auction
and the proceeds divided among the
members of the mess using it. In othejr
worda, the present of a substantial sum '
is made to the officer*.
The t urnituro is removed and sawed
up in the dockyard after the ship has
been paid off. When the ship Is recom
mlssloned new plato and furniture hare
to be provided. It Is estimated that an
economy of many thousands of pounds
can bo effected by this extravagant sys
tem being abolished.
Tolstoi's New Book Ready.
ST. PETERSBURG. Oct. 14. â Tolstoi's
new book, which was to have been pub
lished serially in the Russkaia Mysl,
having been forbidden by
the censor, will, it is stated, shortly
be publisned in English under tho title
of "The Great Transgression." In this
work the famous author endeavors to
show that tho Russian people will not
be able to obtain any serious political
reforms so long as . they do not rid
themselves of their principal \u25a0 fault,
which is in not claiming the Indubitable
and natural right they possess of own-
Ing and cultivating a part of the soil

COLLEGE INFLUENCES UPON SOCIETY
Never as now has society found it
fcelf so wearied, so impatient with Its
own lack of resource and spontaneity.
Never as now has the strain after
the unusual been so relentless.
Never as now have so many eligible
girls and men deliberately cut the
dances and ihe dull dinners that hang
heavy over each social season. These
are the awards of the .debutantes and j
are beloved by them alone. To most of \
the bachelor girls and men these "gay
ctles" have become ineffable bores and
it is from other sources that they
must seek their pleasures.
Fortunately for iSan Francisco so
ciety is beginning to draw heavily
upon the universities for rejuvenation.
It is bringing thought into the draw
ing-room and threatens to revive con
versation. I
Cards are declining in sets where
college girl predominates, and livelier,
saner things are done to amuse, even
to substituting conversation for chat
ter.
In Eastern university towns â as in
near-by towns â the social life is
etrongly colored with the life upon the
campus. The influence of college Is
felt in the type of amusements, and a
large part of the social life centers
around the social affairs of college.
Now that a large part of our smart
society are alumni from the universi
ties the leaven of their presence is felt.
More interest Is taken to-day In the
activities of college life than ever
before, and* a hope for the resuscitation
of local society lies therein.
As it finds Itself this year it is
a-weary from inanition. It needs food
as well as fun, and the right kind of
both.
And the influence of the colleges
promise to do it. And may the good
time hasten.

Flat r.ofm Forth That Uurm Alexandra
Mmt Eat No More Sweet
Thing*.
LONDON. October 14.â Even royalty
finds it necessary to yield obedience to
the doctor's orders. The fiat has gone
forth that Queen Alexandra must eat no
more ' sweet things. In consequence, a
well known firm of London pastry cook?,
who have for many years supplied her
Majesty with confectionery arid other
tempting delicacies, have had their order
canceled. For their loss of trade they
are consoled by the fact .that they are
stll! allowed to display the coat of arms
whicn indicate! that they axe under royal
patronage. The Queen has long -een in
ordinately fond of sweets and confec
tions and has recklessly Indulged her ap
petite for them. That has produced -*Â«
accumulation of superfluous adiposo^^ \u25a0
sue. which even the most expert of dress
makers are unable to conceal. She is no
longer slim and willowy, though English,
newspapers continue so to describe her.
Her medical attendant has told her that
her only hope of regaining something like
her youthful contour of figure liâ¬ 3 in
the practice of rigid self-denial with re-
Bpect to the dainties she enjoys most.
The Princess of Wales has also received
a hint from a high medical authority that
she will some day become a second edi
tion of her mother, the Duchess of Teck,
who was enormously fat, unless she prac
tices frugality In the matter of , confec
tions.

COAL MESURES
ARE INVOLVED
Bondholders' in Sonora Cor
poration File Suit to
Ilecover $700,000 bamages
REPUDIATION ALLEGED
Plaintiffs Assert That New
Company Kefused to As
sume Obligations of Old
Suit involving title to coal measures
of Sonora, Mexico, recently transferred,
was instituted, yesterday in the Superior
Court. The plaintiffs in the action are
James Ainsa, B. V. Garcia, Jeaus Alnsa,
F. H. Garcia, Kate J. Black, George W.
Jackson and M. Lopez and the defendants
are thÂ« Mexican Coal ; Mining Company,
A. J. Uhlmann. Charles Lane. H. G.
Stevenson, J. D. Arnold. William J.Din
gee, I* W. Shinn. R. v M. Strauss, J. D.
Hopkins and C. P. Eagan.. The plaintiffs
demand Judgment against. the defendants
for $700,000 damages, with interest from
July 2, 1901, less eight per cent, which
the plaintiffs admit having indirectly re
ceived at the time : o the transfer which
Is complained of in the suit.
The plaintiffs allege that prior to July
2, 1901, they held bonds. of the total value
of $700,000 in the Compania Explotadora
dft Tereno Carboniferos en Sonora, a Mex
ican corporation, such bonds, under, the
law of Mexico, standing as a lien against
the corporation. On July ' 2, 1901, it Is
alleged, the Sonora corporation sold . to
C. P. Eagan the coal j measures involved.
In turn Eagan organized the "Mexican
Coal Mining Company," of which "the de
fendants named- are members, .and trans
ferred to the corporation -title "to .the
measures. It is alleged that Eagan se
cured possession of <\u25a0 the measures, - well
knowing that the plaintiffs held the' in
terest therein as stated, but since the or
ganization of the Mexican Coal Mining
Company it has repudiated the bonds held
by the plaintiffs in the Sonora corpora
tion.. %
At the time of the transfer of the prop
erty it is admitted that the defendants
paid the Sonora corporation- eight per,
cent of the agreed purchase price of $700,
000, which sum has been, credited' to - the
bondholders of Â» the Sonora corporation.
Now. the plaintiffs demand judgment for,
the balance of the $700,000 "with interest
as- stated. It Is alleged that- the -coal
measures Involved are worth far in ex-:
cess of . $1,000,000.
The plaintiffs, are represented by Attor
ney Joseph -McKinley.
ATTORNEYS FOR MURDERERS
RAISE TECHNICAL POINTS
Claim That Chilion Hoiren anil. John
A. Logan Bell ; Have < Been ,
Illegally Held. . ;
When the cases of Chilion Bowen,
charged with the murder of William A.
Stephensonof Washoe, Nev., and John
A. Logan Bell, charged with the mur
der of his stepfather, were called In
Judge Lawlor's court yesterday for the
defendants to plead, motions to dismiss
were made in each case on similar
grounds. The points raised will be
argued .next Saturday.
The principal : point Is that the de
fendants were held" to ; -answer by the
Police Court and not by aya v Judge there
of acting as a magistrate, it being con
tended that the provision of the charter
establishing a Police' Court Is
stitutional, as the -Penal*; Code pro
vides that those who can j sit as com
mitting magistrates are Justices of the
Supreme Court. Superior Court Judge,
Police Court Judges and Justices of the
Peace, but not the Police Court acting
as a Police Court.
The other.ground 1s that the commit
ting magistrate under an act passed by
the Legislature must indorse the order
holding the defendant to answer on
the back of the complaint instead of
on a fugitive sheet.

AMERICAN CHILD RINGS
FAMOUS ABBEY BELL
Montana Girl En joy s Unique
Distinction on Visit to
Westminster.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Oct. 14. â Now that most of
the summer visitors from the' United
States have, gone back, there are not
as many little American girls in Lon
don as there were a while ago, but of
those whp remain ther..e .isn't a prouder
one to-day than Miss Evelyn MacNlven
of Butte, Mont. Little Miss MacNiven,"
whose years number only. B, yesterday
had the honor of ringing the bell of
Westminster Abbey that summons
worshipers to the venerable fane. , It
is the first time a little American girl
has done this, or, in fact, any little girl,
bo far as is known. â¢
It is because the small Miss MacNlven
possessed the enterprise of the true
American girl that she had this en
viable experience. She and her parents,
who recently arrived' in London, were
paying a visit to thÂ« abbey, which .is
invariably ; one of : the '\u25a0 first duties of
Americans in the metropolis, when the
little girl wandered off on a tour of
inspection of her. own among the royal
tombs. , \u25a0 , Â»
Spying one of the '/vergers" or ush
ers, tho little, girl from Butte promptly
annexed and plied him with questions.
It happened that during the absence of
the regular bellringer of the Abbey It
was this official's duty to ring the bell,
and the hour of the 3 o'clock service
approaching, he asked his email ques-'
tioner,' to whom he had taken a' fancy,'
if she would like to be the first little
girl to call worshipers to Westminster
Abbey. s i
Naturally she jumped at the chance
and so when her . parents had been
"collected* 1 all parties set out for the
room below the great belfry of the
Abbey, where the chimes are rung,
and there, after, having been instructed
by the verger,, the little girl from Butte
laid hold of the' dangling rope and
rang the bell. ;, .. ,' !
The call to service at !the Abbey con
sists of several : long: strokes^ followed
by three quick ones, which, the verger
explained, . were ' designed in the early
days of the f great fane, to warn V the
various clergymen to be in their places.

PETEESEN IN TROUBLE
Erandulent: Citizen Declares
Schmitz Is the Governor,
and ' Abe Euef Pfesidehi
Captain John 'Gordon Hitchfleld, chief
officer of the Mongolia, was admitted ..to
citizenship yesterday" by United States
Circuit Jddge Morrow. Captain Hitch
field's naturalization- papers were found
to be irregular because of error of one
of his witnesses. â¢ and United States- Se
ciet Service Agent John H. Helms-took
'away his papers and his seagoing li
censes. Captain Hitchfleld then went be
fore the. United, States Circuit Court- and
applied for naturalization on his declar
ation of intention, those papers having
been obtained in the legal way. United
States District Attorney, Devlin with
drew all objection, and Judge Morrow,
after the usual questions 'had been satis
factorily answered by Captain Hitchfleld;
admitted him to citizenship. ,' f
, Judge Morrow remarked at the same
time! that this was the ) first . case .of â¢ the
kind that had ever come 'before him, and
he desired it to be understood that in all
future cases where the; applicant^ could
show that his intention papers f had not
been fraudulently obtained, he would per
mit such intention papers to form.; the
basis of an application for re-naturaliza
tion. : It was evident to him that in^the
case of Captain Hitchfleld there had been
no intention on his part to defraud. V f,
Samuel Martin Petersen,,; holding' a
master's license in the American mer
chant marine, was gathered .yesterday
into the net of Secret Service Agent
Helms. The agent's numerous assistants
had been at work for several weeks on
Petersen's case and when all the- facts
had been gathered Helms sent for .the
mariner and requested a statement.; Pet
ersen glibly declared that he was natur
alized in the Superior Court of Merced
County on March 5, 1900, and showed
the agent what purported to be a copy
of those papers bearing .the seal of the
court and the .certificate of the clerk.
He denied that he had ever been nat
uralized anywhere else.
\u25a0Mr.- Helms then confronted the aston
ished mariner with the following facts:
on September . 18, 1891. : Petersen \ again
United States Local Inspectors Bolles and
Bulger for a license as mate, and on
that occasion swore that he~was born in
Norway in 1562. and that he was natural
ized in Judge Coffey's couJ-t in this city
on â¢September, 18, 1891. 'Petersen again
applied on November 12, 1902, for licenses
as master of sail and second mafe of
steam vessels and swore that he was
born In Norway in; 1864. On January 12.
1905. he applied for, a license as chief
mate of steam vessels and , swore that
he was born in Norway in 1866.
When Petersen found that Agent
Helms . had his history at his fingers'
ends he confessed everything In con
nection with the matter.; His \ story,
was that a man whom ho knew, as
Judge William Burke had informed
him that he had been long enough, in
the. country to. be a citizen and that he
would get: his- naturalization/ papers
without .putting Petersen, to any.trour
ble in app"ea"ring'befora' a court... Burke
gave him his naturalization' papers,
purporting to have been Issued out" of
Superior Judge Coffey's court,. and_told
him at the ) same time- that they .would
be of no use 'to hlrn, : outside "of San
Francisco; that if he went to the coun-'
try he would have to be naturalized in
the country. It 'was for this reason,
Petersen. explained, that he became nat
uralized also in Merced' .
Petersen finally admitted that Burke
was not "a'Judjje at all, but conducted
a navigation school In this city, of
which Petersen was a pupil. Burke
has since died. Agent Helms placed
Petersen under arrest for perjury com-,
mitted before the: United States local
inspectors. United States Commission^
er Heacock ordered the prisoner to ap^
pear" for examination ; on Monday at
2p. m.. andflxed his bail' at $2000. '\u25a0\u25a0 ">
Superior- Judge [Kerrigan yesterday
reinstated Svend Stangeland to citi
zenship.' The application ;of August
Petersen to be reinstated to citizenship
was denied on' account of the j appli
cant's dense Ignorance of American in
stitutions.' He was chief mate of the
steamer Olympia,' and this papers -had
been taken away from him by United
States Secret Service Agent Helms.
He said that' Eugene Schmitz was
Governor of California, lie could- riot
remember who was President of the
United State's, he said, but he thought
it was Abe Ruef.

TALBOT CASE
IS ON TRIAL
Wife of Capitalist Tells
Why She Needs Large Al^
lowaiice . and Counsel Fees
MANY TO GO ON STAND
Says She Will Obtain Testir
; mony of Easterners -to
Bear Out; Her Allegations
William H. Talbot, capitalist, and his
wife, Annie D. Talbot, "who; is suing him
for maintenance, met in Judge Murasky's
court yesterday. "No- sign of. recognition
passed between them, but when one was
sure the other was riot looking : an In
spection of features arid dress would be
enjoyed, r
\u25a0Talbot -'found" his wife handsomely
gowned In a . brown j foulard, a rich gray
feather stole : thrown., over her shoulders
and a white \u25a0 felt hat, . graced | with black
plumes, completing her toilette. Talbot
was dignified in a dark English walking
suit, a pink 'carnation fresh from the
florist lending a touch of color. Talbot' s
face reflected but little of his thoughts as
he inspected his. wife, but she could not
restrain â¢ fhe disdainful smiles that told
of [the bitterness feels against him. ggj
When the case was called for hearingâ
a petition directing Talbot to show cause
why -he should not pay, his wife alimony
pending-the final determination of her
suit being : on the J calendarâ Attorney
Samuel M. Shortrldge, chief counsel for
Mrs. '-- Talbot, read her- complaint. Dun
can E. McKlnlay, : associate . counsel for
the , plaintiff, read the answer, and Tal
bot was called to the stand.
Attorney Shortridge asked him how
much separate" property he ownedâ Mrs.
.Talbot stating; that the community'prop
erty | is : worth I $1,500,000 and his separate
property $I,ooo,oooâ but his counsel saved
him the necessity of answering by admit
ting that if the court so orders he Is
financially able to meet Mrs. Talbofs
demand for $5000 counsel fees, $2500 costs
and a monthly, allowance of $2500. Talbot
then left the stand and Mrs. Talbot took
his place. / ~ ;
. : She testified that all the â¢ ready money
she possesses .Is $400 on deposit in one
bank and $500 in another and all of thl*
amount, she said, she owed on bills. Her
demand for counsel fees,- costs and an al
lowance, she said, was not excessive in
view of her husband's '.wealth and the
demands upon her purse. Her household
expenses are large, she explained, and
her daughter is now being Instructed at
home,^ while her. sons are attending a pri
vate university. '
Furthermore, she complained, she needs
funds to secure depositions of hotel clerks
and proprietors in .the East, nurses in
this 'city and to secure the attendance of

SUNDAY OCTOBER IS, 1905
FOR ANTI-DIVORCE PEOPLE.
THE discussion of divorce goes on intermittently, but earnestly.
The rights of society in the matter are pleaded to reinforce the
moral and religious argument. Society has the right to have
families reared by the joint care and nurture pf both parents. Di
vorce interrupts this, and the court distributes the children. Whether
given to the care and custody of the father or the mother, painful
scenes occur. The right of the non-custodian to occasionally visit
the children only keeps alive the painful memories connected with
the unfortunate situation. Frequently the children of divorced
parents are in nv.ny respects worse off than orphans or half-orphans.
At best theirs is only half a home, with either the father or the
mother lacking to its completeness. Society suffers the results in
citizens that may be said to be incompletely reared. Frequently the
children, at a tender age, are partisans in the parental controversy.
In the hotly contested divorce suit between Captain Taggart and
his wife the little sons sided with their mother. One of them was
so violently partisan than he said if the court gave him to his father
he would run away or shoot himself. Such things are appalling, and
if a little patience and self-restraint will prevent them, it is pitiful
that these are lacking.
Tho interest of society in the married state is vital and pro
found. We speak of society in its sociological sense and not in
its artificial sense. Society makes the rules and regulations and the
ethics of domestic life and intercourse. Society owes it to itself
that its common law of conduct shall, better protect married
manners and morals. But when society assumes the right to say
that there shall be no divorce, it is the same as assuming the right
to say that there shall be no marriage. The church, joining in the
controversy, declares that there shall be no divorce, treating as
sacrosanct what the State treats entirely as a civil contract.
Turning from the social wrongs chargeable to divorce, is it
deniable that society will be wronged by denying divorce? The
newspapers every day, in current news, furnish facts upon which
to found a valid argument for divorce as a means of mitigating
human misery. A recent case in this city is in point. The father of
a family, stout and- physically able to work, chose to keep drunk
and idle for nearly a \ear. He omitted any provision for his family,
which seems to have depended upon the exertions of the wife and
mother.
During this time he continually beat and abused the mother
of his children, and ended by seizing his seven months' old baby
and dashing it against^ the wall, breaking its leg. The suffering
mother's remonstrance was answered by a beating that jfeft her
helpless and unconscious. Then, to prevent her tailing a police
man, this husband stripped her of her clothing. By this he also pre
vented the calling of medical assistance for the child he had nearly
killed. If there is anywhere a picture of more abject woe than this
presents it has not been published.
We speak of such things as brutal. But that does gross injus
tice to our fellow beings, the beasts that perish. No brute but. man
is capable of such things. The blood grows hot in contemplating
it and the law seems to fail in adequacy of punishment. But what
will society do about it? Shall a woman be held in bonds to such a
monster? Is the church willing to say that she has no' remedy? Is
society helped by holding such households together? Are the chil
dren subject to such inhuman cruelty better than the young of a
divorced couple? Will society stand by and enforce the claim of
such a monster to his marital rights and his paternal authority? jÂ»
It is unthinkable. There is no answer in pattering about the class
to which such families belong. We are all of one class. The social
obligation knows no class nor kind. The sufferings. of that wretched
wife and mother are part of the social torture and misery. If she
have no escape, then the door of hope is locked against all her sex.
If she can escape, others may avail themselves of the same means. If
society furnish no way out of such a hell, then suicide is the only
remedy. Is it well to encourage that? It is an unfortunate symp
tom of social disease that cases of this kind, let us hope in less de
gree, and of desertion of their families by men, are increasing in
our large cities. What will society and the state and the church
do about it?
COLONIAL ECONOMIC STUDY.'
ASSISTANCE to the acquirement of skill in conducting the
great work which the United States has undertaken for the
Philippine Isknds could no dclpt be obtained by t s*uÂ«ly
of the experiences which the English have gathered in their ex
tensive governmental dealings with alien races. In an address
delivered by the president to the Economic Science and Statistics
Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science,
in which although he is considering South Africa specifically he
treats of economics in a general way, there are some remarks which
show the necessity of investigating the actual history of past
development in order to help formulate plans for new ones. As
the British â¢ are the greatest colonizers of the world, and as we
are of the same race, and as we are beginners on the art of con
trolling colonies, there are reasons why we should recognize
the value to us of what the British know and think about the
subject. /
The address deals with unconscious assumptions in economics.
Even the assumptions that have been made current by the great
economists who are called classic are liable to mislead when newly
applied to some country that is developing under new conditions.
John Stuart Mill describes political economy as, a N "science which,
assuming the facts of human nature and the physical world, con
siders the laws of production and distribution of wealth." The
president thinks we must limit what we may legitimately assume
as the facts of human nature, for we cannot take for granted that
human nature is the same the world over. We are perhaps not
making allowance enough for nature's preference and purpose for
differentiation.
It is said that we can no longer take for granted that human
lims and activities are becoming closely similar in all parts of the
globe, even for economic purposes. In the consideration of what
the British must do in South Africa he finds that every particular
economic problem presents itself in a new aspect, but says that it
â¢s a pleasure to thus renew the struggle with an old. difficulty in a
fresh form. The value to us from this address is to note that tliere
is no set of cut and dried economic principles that will serve for
newly developing conditions, and to see the usefulness of the mul
titude of facts British history of colonial efforts furnishes for our
examination. "There is a mass of experience in the past which may
be drawn upon as a help; we may appropriate it and save. ourselves
the expense of buying fresh experience in a costly fashion." " That
experience, however, he says, is not lying about for any one to pick
WHAT is going to be the diet of the superman can probably
be answered only by George Bernard Shaw;, for the number
of cults and fads that are now professing to be reforms in
eating are enough to confuse the best intentioned who /wish to find
the wisest method of linking, via the stomach, the spiritual man
with the material upon which he must base his life. , Writing in
the October CentunV Professor Chittenden tells us of the wonderful
tilings that can be accomplished by alteration from a habit imposed
diet to one that the science of alimentation would show, to be cor
rect.
He opposes not only the common customs of the generality of
people as to eating, but also the standardsset up by dietary, experts.
His ideas are not just theories, for he has been putting them to the
DIET FADS.

effective sustainment. .' \ . ' \ ' * \u25a0
The remarkable thing about his teaching is that when the right
kinds and proportions of food are used only about half the. quantities
usually prescribed are necessary to give abundant life. The/people
experimented upon were of various. ages and habits of' life and they
were enabled by the change of diet.to. do their work with" increased
energy and ease. Some of them gained in weight. One of them
won an intercollegiate championship. This particular/ cult is not
wholly vegetarian, but is more inclined that way than is our common
custom. In one of the recommended .meals there is no meat but an
ounce and a half of bacon. The' rest is macaroni, bread, potatoes,
butter, sugar, cream and coffee. The admission of coffee seems to
signify that he is not a fanatic. \u25a0 â¢', \u25a0 .
In all these various diet fads there is one reform that seems
to be held with some consistency throughout, and that, is that we eat
too much meat. Some extremists say we should use none at all,
and they 'being in the minority will probably not at present' be
heeded very much, but all the reformers favor lessening, the amount
of meat that we now consume. It has not yet been reported whether
their preaching of the gospel of less meat has greatly injured or
even alarmed the beef trust. Perhaps, there is more: hopÂ£ of down-,
ing those barons by abstinence than there is by legislation. "
Whatever be the measure of truth in '\u25a0 these -^"attempts of
science to teach us dietary reform, it must remain true that most
of even the wisest improvements can only be introduced gradually.
W T e are creatures of gradual evolution and our stomachs having be
come adapted to craving and digesting certain kinds of food they
cannot be trained to some other methods with-such celerity as the
mind can be . made to recognize them as scientifically correct. It
will be well though to at least make a beginning in the right direc
tion, and not let half-blind instinct have too much rule. Another
principle that cannot be ignored is that one man's meat is another
man's poison. If you eat a dinner obedient to the ordering of what
some' other man considers ideal, you are likely to pay for your com-"
plaisance with nightmare dreams. J

""THERE'S a wonderful-land where the. waters play
]-' -On a white, bright strand that is far away;
And the ripples "sing as they kiss the shore
A song* tKat is, sweet as a dream of yore;
And the pleasant paths forever are trod
By the ones who smile to the smile of God,
As .they patiently wait by the silvery strand
For voyagers borne from the earthly land;
And to greet them there;
And that haven of peace my soal shall see f
For it is the Land of Going-to-Be.
MY course is uncharted: the storms beat hleh.
And the voice .of the wind is an eerie sign;
My compass is broken; my sails are torn,
And hither and thither my bark is borne. .
Yet I know right well that the Pilot knows
The floundering course that my shallop goes,

And hear the promise it waits for me. ;

And shattered the mast,

And still through the shadows they whisper to me,
"Come over, come over the billowy sea,

And ever, forever, storm-beaten and tossed,

MOLDING YOUNG MINDS
ANGELA MORGAN
MUCH interest 'is being manifested by thoughtful people to-day In th*
subject of- hypnotism as an aid in the training of children.
Recently a woman physician of New York aroused considerable press
comment by dcv larinsr that mothers, in order to cure their offspring of unde
sirable traits and wayward tendencies, should train themselves to bÂ« hypnotists.
The !dea was treated seriously by some exchanges and lightly by others, and
was doubtless dismissed by the majority of mothers who read of it v some
thing too ridiculous and fantastic to consider with any gravity.
If these mothers only realized ft. the main principle underlying this â¢eem
ingly amusing theory deserves the earnest attention of every parent In the land.
: I do not agree with this woman physician that mothers should hypnotlza
their "children: at least, I should not so express my belief. I would say, rather,
that every mother study the laws of suggestion and train her children
to help themselves by the proper use of auto-suggestion. By this mean 3 a child
may: be taught to develop into just the sort of character the mother wishes
it to bo. \u25a0\u25a0â . , \u25a0 . " <"
As it goes without saying that every normal mother wants her child to bÂ«
brave strong, healthy and happy, it would be the object of the mother In ap
plying these laws to give her offspring only ;such- suggestion? as would encour
age bravery, strength, health, happiness and all good tral* .
By systematically giving a child "suggestions of positive good, the child in
turn is enabled to give himself the right sort of auto-suggestionsâself-sugges
tions or self-Impressions.
This does not mean that the parent obtains "control" of thÂ« child's mind:
nor does it mean that any mysterious power- Is Invoked or supernatural agency
employed. The mother who uses suggestion in training her children is simply
recognizing a natural law: a law which to-day is admitted by psychologists to
be one of the greatest forces in nature.
Whether conscious of ; the fact or not, mothers, every day of their lives,
are employing this- force in the -training of the young. Every mother, by
wÂ»rds sDoken in the presence of her offspring, by looks, smiles, frowns, ges- b
turesâ indeed, by her. entire attitudeâ uses suggestion, either adverse or favor
able.' in molding their characters. . '
What is the secret of the' "bad", child? Listen to this dialogue of the nursery:
You have heard something like it, haven't you?
Mother (to interested relative)â l'm sure I don't know what I shall do with
Bobby. He's getting to be a regular little terror. Every day I seÂ« his father's
temper developing fn him. - and you know from the first we could see heÂ» was
marked with his Uncle Bob's - headstrong disposition. I believe the boy inherits
'all a the -.bad traits in the family combined. %
"Interested Relative (sighing heavily)â Well, Mary, you certainly have your
hands 'full in training him. You'll have to employ firmness witn that child.
What happens? Bobby, in thÂ«Â» corner, ears wide open. Is smitten with the
consciousness that he Is branded; accursed: a "bad, bad boy." Naturally bad.
..And what is the secret of the good child? Listen to the continuation o<
the nursery,' dialogue:, . ..
Mother (cheerfully)â Eut there is Susie, nowâ bless her! As obedient and good
as a lnmb. . I never have to tell her. twice to do anything 1 . She Just naturally
wants to be good. She's just like her dear, beautiful Aunt Ida. She'll be just
such a character when she's grown. -> Â»
And Susie? Sitting in her little armchair, she feels her whole small being
glow with the consciousness that she is a good child. Ever after the actions of
these two - children are influenced by the suggestions given in the nursery. And
as these are > repeated day after day, their characters are shaped accordingly.
"Thought is a positive dynamic force and takes form in action." says Dr.
Herbert A. Parkyn in that wonderful little book of his, "Auto-Suggestion." And
he says further: "A young child's mind Is very much like a barrel, so far as
its first impression? are concerned. Its mind is an empty thing, waiting to be
filled with any kind of Impressions, and the impressions of childhood are by
far the most lasting." \ â¢ ( i
Parents, if you want your children to be happy, healthy, brays and strong,
give them the suggestions that will make them so.
DEALING WITH A SULTAN
THE story of an interview that once took place between Mrs. Reader
and the Sultan of Johore, India, Is thus related by Juliet Wllbor
Tompklns in her. continuation of the history of "Ella Rawls Reader.
Financier," in the October Everybody's:
"She named' her conditions; the right to issue $5,000,000 worth of 5 per
cent bonds. 120.000 acres of land extending along the 120 miles of track.
tin minesâ but here royalty demurred a little, he thought he would keep
all the tin mines. For the first' time the young contractor slipped into
v- feminine processes of reasoning and set aside for a moment the urgent
business-full enthusiasm of the promoter for the dismay of the human,
girl "who sees her pet project in danger of failure.
"'But you are so rich, you know you don't need all those "mines.' shÂ«
' argued, 'and we do!'
"The Sultan' conceded the mines. From an Oriental polntof view the
experience was perhaps cheap at. the price. He conceded the $5,000,000
worth of bonds, the 120.000 acres of land. At the end of their three hours'
talk Ella Rawls had in her possession a $5,000,000 dollar Contract to
' build a railroad across the State of Johore, and its ruler had secured, on .
fair terms, a means to wealth and civilization the need of which, could no ..
longer be Ignored. She had come to him at the psychological moment. â¢
*â¢-- when the cbntract'.was ripe for giving; she had shown herself clear-head- \u25a0
ed and resolute, master of the facts and frankly open In her statements;
.she had demanded much,\knowing the value of what she gave, but there
'had been no sign of sharpness, of trying to steal an advantage. No doubt
\u25a0 to a man accustomed to be approached by indirect methods, by arif t3 and
flatteries, there was a wholesome convincingness 'in this novel experience,
a welcome promise of good faith. At all events, he accepted freely and
wholly." \u25a0 \u25a0 \ -.

AND SOME OTHER STORIES
"THE GIANTS' is tiie title of a new
novel by a California \u25a0woman, Mrs. Fre
mont Older, who is not wholly a new
novelist, for she is the author of "The
Socialist and the Prince." The hero of
her new stcry i^ named Jack and he is
a Jack the Giant Killer in the modern
ized sense of destroying a monster Of
monopolistic oppression. Jack is a law
yer and kills the g:ant in a legal battle
that ends by the monopolist of oil going
to Jail in disgrace. It is not a fairy
story except that the chiefly offending
giant, to wit. the King of Petroleum, gets
safely jailed by Jack in the tlction,
whereas, for a fact, we know he is still
free to go outdoors and owns nearly all
of it.
We do not positively know whether the
. King of Petroleum ought to be slain by
lawyer .-trong and clever enough to
JiÂ»e modern Jack the Giant Killer, but we
know there is so much popular prejudice
against the great monopolist that even to
destroy him tietitiously will be applauded
by the multitude as a poetic justice de
voutly to bo wished. So to see him pulled
down will be a sort of temporary stay
ing at the appetite for the real thingâ
of tbe actual auwnfall which the devout
wisuers may satisfy themselves with hop
ing the book truly predicts. There is
a trim satisfaction in hanging a man in
ffligy. Mrs. Older's new novel will give
just that sort of satisfaction to those
who di<=!ike the man and the methods of
the gigantic petroleum trust.
The author never in her novel names
the name that superlatively associates
itself in the mind wnh the thought of the
greatest of till the giants who have
oppressed by petroleum monopoly; but it
is hardly necessary. The motif of her
no\ei is to smite a man who has been
put in pillory of public condemnation for
destroying tree competition in the pe
iroieum industry; and for being the arch
nen.J ot the rebate iniquity; to make him
a fixed figure "lor the hand of scorn to
point her slowly moving ringer at." and
encourage pelting him with any old fling.
She cahs this ttfigy Jabez Kand and
makes a monster ot him. Meanwhile the
old man v.i the piilory flings back, for
reply to the public, certined checks of
vast valueâ ten million dollars the latest
uoc was, for educational and charitable
purposes. Dear God: that's a drama.
"Hit him again, he's got no friends."
It was Ida Tarbell who hit so hard
W^s similitude In a two-volume work, in
the man in the pillory is dis
tinctly labeled Rockefeller. That work
was history, or at least purported to
be history. A writer in the North
American Review. G. 11. Montague, law
yer, editor. Harvard man, with a degree
of A. B. sumraa cum laude, author of
"The Rise and Progress of the Standard
Oil Company," of the Harvard graduate
school and winner of the Ricardo prize
in economics, virtually denies that Miss
Tarbell's work is history. lie satirically
speaks of her conclusions as "The
Legend of the Standard Oil." "Legend,"
indeed', that's enough to make the Tar
beliites sit up aad listen. If you go to
the libraries to settle the question by
noting how they hayÂ« classified the im
portant two volumes you get left. It
is not classified as history, nor is it
put among the legends and myths. It
Is rightly catalogued as chemistry and
shelved in the oil regions. Mr. Mon
tague and Miss Tarbell can there fight
out the question of the historicity of
the history of the Standard oil. The
cataloguer magnanimously waives the
issue. It is as dangerous to fool with
big public prejudices as it is to play
with gunpowder, and more perilous still to
tackle authenticity and pride of author- j
ship. Besides there's conscience, you
know. But certain â it's about oil, and
oil will smooth all troubled waters.
Now, if one is inclined to be v gam
bler, it would be a not wholly reck
less lay to bet that "The Giants" is
based on a sincere faith in Tarbell be
.V g history. "The Giants," however,
ff.il be classified as fiction. The quan
rfary between, legend shelf and history
shelf is not for it. If the North Amer
ican Review reviewer tears Ida Tar
bell's book's authenticity to tatters,
then that is for Miss Ida to confute;
but "The Giants" is still fiction In name
and claim, and the right to be absurdly
sternly reckoned with as to historicity
end the true, bona fide portraiture of
the most remarkable commercial per
sonage and puzzling sociological study
of this age is thus waived.
To do justice to a book of this kind
is a much more complicated task than
the reviewing of a work that is clear
cut either way â purely imaginative
fiction or straight history or biography.
There is a much more puzzling- un
known quantity of moral responsibil
ity attached to it. Not nearly so much
as attaches to the writing of such a
novel, but nevertheless a persistently
questioning unknown quantity;.. "The
Giants." as well as Tarbell's history of
the Standard Oil, are evidently con
scientious attacks on an evil commer
cial system, and a man whom a large
part of the public believes to be a
eondemnably unscrupulous perfecter of
that system and cruelly militant ap
piler of the same. "The Giants" bold
ly and cleverly follows *up with the
dramatic force of attack there lies !n
strong fiction the battle the Tarbell
history had begun. To what extent
-Jfaat fiction portrait of a great petrol
jbÂ±'i magnate is based on original re
search, and to what extent the as
sumption is presumption that it is based
on Tarbell's challenged conclusions,
are questions, which to thoroughly
know would be to much simplify the
public's problem of Just the fair
amount of appreciation to measure out
to "The Giants." Just considered as a
novel, and a novel only, it is excellent,
and will be of far more than ordinary
Interest, but if In addition to that merit
it gives us an authentically based por
trait of a personality who is just now
of vast economic and sociologic Impor
tance to all the world, and with right
deductions and true Intuitions and
sensible imagination fills out the por
trait until It becomes that fine quality
of fiction which Byron says is truer
than history, then "The Giants" is en
titled to be received by the reading
public with the interest due an extra
ordinary work. On the face of it the
book seems to be making a bold bid J
for the extraordinary ! interest that j
would attach to such a more than mere '
fiction story. 1
As to whether ' the God's creature in

able enlightenment or caricatured . to

dices ia a writ-large Interrogation
point which the hand of Conscience
puts on the book's back, and Art also
wants to know about that matter and
underscores the query sign. If some
lnerrant Justice could answer that the
picture is conscience true â art true,
â¢ then "The Giants" deserves a multitu
dinous reading ajid a gigantic .success,
-tfj* the great financier portrayed there
of is a monster whom the public
should have their. indignation aroused
against until they destroy him and the
commercial system he supremely rep
resents. To try to be Just to this God's
creature though, as well as to the 1
book, must give us pause, for he may
not be wholly financial fiend incarnate,
but simply the superlative product of
this age of individualistic philosophy:
and be endeavoring to live like a
Christian gentleman as nearly as is
practically profitable in an environ
ment where competition reigns su
preme.
In this effort to be fair it should not
be forgotten that the North American
Review writer, Montague, he who thinks
Ida Tarbell has embodied in her book,
"The Legend of the Standard Oil," uses
about it such expressions as this: "Fail
ure to examine the evidence and careless
disregard of facts that oppose common
tradition are serious defects in a his
tory." And this: "Episodes which have
been shown to be without foundation, but
which Miss Tarbell repeats In the be
lief, apparently, that even a statement
proved untrue, if quoted widely enough,
acquires tho auality of evidence." So
much jusÂ»t to warn the readers of the
novel that in enjoying its full worth as a
story they must remember there are two
opinions about the iniquity of the Pe
troleum King. The conclusion of the
Tarbell book is so fine in its evident de
sire to be ethical and "The Giants" is
so celever as a story and so sincere in its
enthusiasm to dramatically show ud a
great evil, it would be comfortable to,
Pilate-like, wash one's hands of the
quandaries of the matter, and since, in
regard to the Petroleum King, the cry
is crucify himf Crucify-' htm! then say,
if he deserves It,' bravo, literary lances,
errant, brave and bright; but If, per
: chance, the donative old mart- is, after'
all, more benevolent than villainous, why
then, his blood be on the heads of Ida
Tarbell and Mrs. Older.
The story represents the hero. Jack Ire- !
ton, as being incensed against the oil
monopoly when he was a mere boy in
California, because his father's fortune
was destroyed by the squeeze-out meth
ods of the "Model Improvement Com
pany," and his father killed by the set
ting afire of some great oil tanks, this
incendiarism being supposed to be the
work of the oil magnate's confidential
agents. There is a very pretty love af
fair runs through the book. This love
affair, it was Ireton's, came very, very
near getting its currents turned awry be
cause of the machinations, temptations
and clever lies of a beautiful woman, who
is represented as being a quondam mis
tress of the great Petroleum King in his
younger years. She has preserved her
beauty Into the thirties and then, being
super-sophisticated, she nearly succeeds
in making young Ire ton a slave of her
charms.
The description of the culminating
effort of this ex-mistress of Jabeaf Rand
to tempt the puritanical Jack Ireton is
the strongest, finest thing in the novel.
Next to a striking cleverness in invent
ing expressions comes the descriptions
of environing scenery. The temptress
scene is the best art shown. It's a
Kundry and Parsifal episode about as
good as anybody could do. Reina. the
j temptress of the story, almost out-Kun
\u25a0 dries Kundry In that she .has that en
slaving charm of so fastening herself in
a man's imagination that the fantasy of
her- stays with him conquerlngly, long
after he has left her physical presence,
making herself a vivldly : imaged delight
that can pass through locked doors, and
so be ever imperiously present and. wak
ing or dreaming, beyond the man's power
to dismiss her. Here Is a description of
Ireton after he had won a moral victory
over Reina:
"It was easy to mount the stairs, to
turn the key in the door, but he could
not bar the presence of 'the woman: it
had entered with him. and clung around
his neck, gighed on his lips and mad
dened him. All that night he lay trem
bling on her soft, white shoulders, and
In the morning jjun the nymphs were
still dancing in his room."

Story of Wagner's'
Platonic Affection
â¢
"Loves of the Great Composers," no
doubt, by means of the research and
thought necessary for Its composition
helped to prepare its author, Gustav
Kobbe, for the writing of his new book,
"Wagner and His Isolde." To people who
are neither musicians nor interested
students of romantic amours it may be
necessary to say that the Isolde of. this
title does not refer to the woman of his
great opera, but to the famous musician's
real Isolde of flesh and blood and beauti
fully incarnated poetic emotions, the wife
of his one-time friend. Otto Wesendonk,
the Mathilde who wrote dream poems
which Wagner ', set to music, the lady,
admiration and affection for whom di
rectly inspired his superlative creation,
"Tristan and Isolde," and indirectly all
of his greater operas, the mistress of his
life-long platonic loveâ in one word, his
Beatrice.
It is, however, a far flight downward
f rojn the high sentiment of Dante's
platonic love for . the blessed Beatrice
to the almost comically mixed senti
ment and sentimentality of the platonic
passion of Wagner, the husband of
the prosaic but fierce Minna, for Ma
thllde, the wife of the unpoetic but
prudently wise Otto Wesendonk. The
love affair was a right noble thing In a

ing art, born of this 'amour that was of
the mind and soul only. Stlll'there
were absurdities to it that make one
smile with a little less than the perfect
reverence we would like to give to. a
more completely sensible and unalloyed
platonlc passion. If one were going to
sermonize over the* love letters and the
most intimate revelations of. this new
book, and sought a text therefor, one
might be found in a sentence from a
beautiful prayer published in the. fa
mous comic paper, Life, of New York,
on the 2d of June, 1904. It is a prayer
that might bo universally used, for it
is utterly undogmatic and will appeal
to every one, religious or irreligious,
who wishes to be. thoroughly sensible
and thoroughbredly game. Some frag
ments may serve to recall the whole,
which is well worth the remembering:
"O POWERS That Be, make me sufficient
to my own occasions. Teach me-, to
kndw and to observe the Rules of the
Game. â¢ â¢ * Let me never lack
pride, or a due sense of humor. * â¢â¢â¢
Help, me not to cry for the moony. â¢ *.*
never to dramatize my spiritual dis
comforts. â¢.-, â¢ â¢. Deliver me from
emotional excess. Deliver me from
atrophy of the emotions. â¢ â¢ â¢
Grant me \u2666 â¢ â¢ to distinguish
sharply between sentiment and senti
mentality, cleaving to the one and de
spising the other." \u25a0
The comment suggested by that text
on Wagner's love letters to a married
woman and the conduct of his j platonic
passion for her is that he did not dis
tinguish sharply enough between senti
ment and sentimentality: that evidently
he did not pray hard enough to be . de
livered from . emotional excess ; that -he
cried too much for the moon; that in his
philandering with another man's wife
whilst -he left his own wife love-neg
lected, he did â¢ not thoroughbredly regard
the Rules of the Game. The single fact
that Otto Wesendonk, with a magnanimi
ty of almost absolute trust, allowed; him
the prlvikge of cultivating and enjoying
an Intellectual and sentimental friendship
with his wife should have held him aloof
from getting so love-sick as to say silly
things to her, and Wagner, shows a sad
insufficiency of . knowing and observing
the Rules of the Game. But, O POWERS
That Be, perhaps, we had! better pardon
the mite of sentimentality, that ' seems in
bad taste in view of what is solemnly
vouched for as a factâ that the pure sen
timent of this sexual ,but unsensual
friendship produced a miracle of operatic
art which is among the world's priceless
possessions. One of the last things Wag
ner wrote to Mathllde Is:- "That 'I, should
have composed .'Tristan' I owe |to you,
and I thank you from the depths of my
heart in all eternity." In the' presence
of the confession of a passion like that,
the outpouring of a gratitude great as
that, and -from a man acknowledged to
be; a genius wno wrought his most ex
alted emotions Jnto an enduring art-form
and gave them to be added. to humanity's
sum. of invaluable beatitudes, carping
criticisms must be reverently dumb.
Still we are perhaps not hypercritical
if we. wonder if that grand thing'might.
not have been done, and t:. even.; more

in this affair Wagner and Mathilde are
virtually the Tristanand Isolde of the
opera,- and "then consider this, Minna
was mad, very, very mad, and as. Wag
ner would express it, "vengefully vio
lent," and she criticized ' the grand
opera with t^his outburst of. a Justly
jealous heart: "Tristan and Isolde are a
nasty, lovesick pair!" After that, need
we inquire too inquisitively what was

'and'=loyed,; : and ;read and ;.wrote, 'young

prose tales as given by the Lambs. . .
That preface is a pretty thing. It
says that the. "Tales- are meant to be
submitted to the young : reader as an
introduction to the study of Shakes
peare, for which purpose his words are
used whenever it seemed possible to
bring them in; â¢ * diligent care has
been taken to select such words as
might least Interrupt the effect of the
beautiful English tongue in which he
wrote" * * "it was the only way in
which could be given to them a few
hints . and .a little foretastes of the
great pleasure which awaits them in
their elder years." â¢ . â¢ "It is hoped
that no worse effect will result than
to make them. wish themselves a little
.older, that they may be allowed to
read the. plays at full length (such a
wish will be neither peevish nor ir
rational)." Consider this closing para
graph of the preface; if it has been
twice read before it can be trebly
read with still a thrill of admiring ap
preciation for an appreciation:
"What these tales shall have been
to the young readers,, that and much
'more it is the writer's wish that the
true plays of Shakespeare . may prove
to " them in older years â enricher% of
the' fancy, 'strcngtheners of virtue, a
withdrawing from all selfish and mer
cenary thoughts and actions, to teach
courtesy... benignity, generosity, hu
manity;, for of examples, teaching
these virtues, his pages are fujl." , .
Mention must be emphasized ' of the
fine Illustrations by Norman M. Price.
There are a score. ot them in colors,
full page anTi- large page at that. One
of the best of them is of Imogen in her
bedroom asleep,- whilst the villain,
lachimo, is Just lifting the lid of the
trunk in which he Is concealed. The
picture S shows the beautiful bracelet,
love gift of her husband, on that love
ly arm which he had called "fairest of
prisoners" when he placed It there as
"manacle" to bind her to his heart for
ever. The picture will help us to re
member that as lachimo stole the af
fection treasured, .pledge- token jewel
from the wrist of this true wife, des
tined to suffer so undeservedly from
slander, he spoke his purpose thus:
Come off, come off :
As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard*
'Tls mine; and this will witness outwardly.
As strongly as the conscience does within,
â¢ To the madding of her lord.
The story of Cymbclene is a fine sample
of the way- in which the Lambs can make
the strong things of Shakespeare simple
enough to be understood by young peo~
pie, and yet retain a glow of beauty
round the prose outline he lets "the
youngsters hear. Here Is a passage that
tells of the parting when Imogen's father
banished her young husband:
"Imogen and Posthumous took %> a most
affectionate leave of each other. "Imogen
gave her husband a diamond ring, which
had been her mother's, and Posthumous
promised never to part with the ring; and
he fastened a bracelet on the arm of his
wife, which he begged she would preserve
with great care, as a token of his love;
they then bid each other farewell with
many, vows o*f love and fidelity.
"Posthumous fell into company at
Rome with some gay young men of dif
ferent nations, who were talking freely
of ladies: each one praising the ladies of
his own country, and his own mistress.
Posthumous^ who had ever -his own dear
lady, in his mind, affirmed that his wife,
the fair Imogen, was the most virtuous,
wise and constant l^dy.in the world."

YOUTH WEARS PETTICOATS
TO AVOID ARMY SERVICE
Ilor In Svritcerland Passes Himself as
a Girl for Seventeen Years.
GENEVA, Oct. 14. â The discovery
that a pretty "girl," aged 17 years, be
longs In reality to the sterner sex has
caused a commotion among the inhabi
tants ofilorat, a village iv the Canton
of Frlbourg.
It appears that the mother had such
a horror of compulsory military service
that she had her only child baptized
and registered as a girl.
For the last seventeen years the boy
has worn petticoats and kept the secret.
He made such a charming "girl" that
he won the hearts of two village swains
and received offers of marriage from
them.
A slight illness led to the discovery.
and the young man will be rechristened.
Dogs Answer Telephones.
GENEVA. Oct. 14.â The romance of
the famous St. Bernard pass Is giving
way before the spread of modern
science. Several huts have been erected
by the monks on various parts of the
pass, where in former days snow-bound
and benighted travelers used to be dis
covered by the dogs. These huts are
connected with the hospice by tele
phone, and the dogs belonging to the
monastery have been trained on a
number being repeated to them, to go
off at once to the hut which bears that
number.-

Pontiff Reminds Visitors That Drag-
Urtnsr Dr?wÂ« Collect Lnrge
Quantities of Microbe^.
ROME. Oct. 14.â An interesting story is
told of hew the Pope received some
j women the other day. His Holiness was
quick to note that they wore long trains,
and at once reminied them that it was
not in the-interestH of health that these
trains should collect quantities of mi
crobes from the streets.
"As for me." he added, "when I am
forced to put a train on my cassock, I
am incommoded, end yet there are pre
lates who uphold it."
"But. holy father." said'one of the
women, "we hold up our trains while
waUting in the streets."
"Still," replied the Pope, "It must be
very Inconvenieirt for you to have, to hold :
your dress." And suiting the action to !
the word, Pius X walked round the room
several times holding up his cassock and
j instating the women as they walked.
The good humor of the. pontiff's visitors
can be imagined. The "Pope hasr no re
gard for pontifical majesty.* As soon as
a visitor enters he scarcely gives him time
to kneel for the benediction, but pushes
him Into an armchair, sits down beside
him,, talks, laughs, and relates anecdotes.
The largest Dante horary in the world
is that of Leonldas Leonelll In Udlne,

ENGLISH PEER WHO RANKS AB I
THE FINEST .GAME â¢ SHOT ?IU - \

LONDON. Oct. 14. â Though 53 years
old, Earl de Grey, upon whose, estate
at IJalgowill the Prince of'Walest'has
recently been shooting, still ranks as
the finest game shot in England. In-,
deea, it is tne geiieral opinion here that
nt! Is the best in the world. Anyhow, >
lie has Kineu more game tria'n - any
other living sportsman. Ten years ago
it Had amounted to 31ti,699 head: Com
prised in tnia list were lll.aoo pheas
ants, Jsa.4oo partridges, 45,500 grouse,
26,5u0 Hares and aoont as many rab
bits. In one year alone hia "bag"
amounted to more than iy, 000. head, in
Yorkshire he once shot 500 grouse .ln
a siugie day and on another occasion
brougnt down 750 pheasants. In Wales,
between sunrise and sunset/ he once
disposed of 950 rabbits. . . ; , â¢ \u0084 :
In America, many people' would : re
gard feats of this kind as sheer slaugh-"
ter rather than. sport, but English \u25a0tolk
do not so consider them', and- Earl de
Grey is English in everything.. His
wonderful knack of -bringing down
birds completely dazes strangers, who
go away and explain to their friends
their firm belief that he '.'simply can't
miBS." But to do him justice all his
sport has not been of that! tame variety
where the only risk run Is that of being
shot by some novice. He has done .a
lot of big game - shooting. \ :ln r India,
where his father, tlie Marquis of RipOn,
who still lives, was Viceroy^for four
years, many big tigers have fallen be
fore his rifle. \u25a0'\u0084 \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0.. \u25a0 . ": n i
1 He is always in good form and does
not'know from personal experience
what it is to be nervous. He is slightly
-under the average height, -but his' fig
ure is broad and well knit.. He never
puts on "side" as the. English call it.
I When at Studley Royals-one of.' the
most lovely country seats in England-r
the grounds of which enclose the fa
mous ruins of Fountain- Abbey, he may
frequently be met walking -or driving
in a cap and knockabout suit, and he
has on more than one occasion been
taken by visitors to be an" individual of '
much less rank than that to which he
rightly lays claim. He bears an his
toric English name and has a j lot' of
blue-blooded ancestry at the -back* of
him, but- there is. nothing .aristocratic
in his appearance. , - V - *
Herbert Spencer would have said that
the marvelous proficiency" ih'e., displays
with powder and shot argues a mis
spent life. He has never gone in' for
anything seriously but "; r ' sport, , though
before he was 30 he sat for* six years
in the House of Commons as-the'repre
sentative of Rlpon.' . On account of .his"
family connections it was easygetting
elected for that borough.' 'For -many
years \u25a0. his father was regarded as one
of the foremost of .'^Liberal; "statesmen,
but It is probable that his "son' s~* fame
as a crack shot will last, the longer.
He is "a favorite, at court and. the post
of treasurer to the Queen's | houseriold
has been conferred on "him.
Lady de Grey Is as distinguished ;.in
society as her husband is, in the realms
of sport. jShe.has sometimes;"/ been
called the uncrowned queen of Covent
Garden: Opera. During, the '; season 'her
stately form' appears night after 'night
and year .after year In the. same 'box
on the grand tier. .'When she first came
out as Lady , Gladys Herbert,' . and | for
years afterward, she was accounted one
of the-mbst beautiful wo'men': ln. society.
She stlllretalns a large'measure.of her

ELLIS A PAL OF KELLY GANG OF THUGS AND HE FOUGHT WITH ANDREWS OVER LOOT
BOTH WSTH THE CROOK WHEN POLICEMAN: LESTRAMGE KILLED HIM AT BERKELEY
William Ellis, whose real name is Lee, and Milton Fraiikliii Andrews were members of the criminal gang that tried
to kill Policeman Lestrangein Berkeley. Lee. who isnowknowiito.be a notorious crook,^ -aiid Aiidrews foiighi over
loot secured by them in Australia. One of the gang was killed by Lestrange. ' Andrews and the fourth, Casey, are
in hiding in San Francisco. - \u25a0
The police of San Francisco hare
learned that "William Kills," who
claim* thst he was murderously as
saulted last AVednrnday nljcht bj â¢â¢Wil
liam Brush," better known to the po
lice nÂ» Milton Franklin Andrews, and
* woman In Berkeley, Is \MUtnin Lee,
! si noxoriou* Australian crook, and he.
ha* been a pal In criminal work of the
man who tried to kill him.
James Kelly, the man who was killed
br Policeman Lr*tranÂ«Â«> in Berkeley on
September 2S, IxlonKnl to the aauie
FÂ»b?. The four who gave battle to
Policeman I.Â«"strancr in the earlr morn
ing: hoar were L.cc, Andrew*, Kelly nnd
a man known fn police circle* as Casey.
The Quartet that encountered the
brave policeman was aa desperate a
t>and of criminal* a* roams the norld.
They have been hunted by the police of
Australia and thi* country for variouft ,
crime*, ranging- from arson to murder. ;
They were knunu as the â¢â¢Howard j
Â«Â«Â»s." - â¢ â¢ â¢ J
A small fortune in jewelry which <
these crooks stole in Australia has been
located In Oakland pawnshop*. The
Oakland police and the police of San
F*ranci*co have been in communication :
with the Australian police for Heveral j
diyi and detective* from that country I
will start for here as soon as ponsiblc. !
The police believe that Andrew* and '
Case?- ar^ in biding- in thia citj-.
\u25a0V Tbe trouble between Andrrira and
l.cc waa over the division of the Aus
tralian spoils.
The \u25a0woman Is an unfortunate who is
infatuated with Andrews atid the police :
do not think that she took any part in
the attempt to murder LÂ»ee. It was a
murderous duel over theJr loot that re
sulted in one thief receiving what may
prove death wounds. ,
The Oakland police and the local police
are confident that in Lee they have one
of the murderous quartet of thugs that
were put to flight in the battle with Po- J
liceman Lestrange. The guns had set
\u25a0 tied in Berkeley to carry out a careful
ly planned series of criir.es.
At the first attempt they were thwarted j
ky the brave officer and one of the grang ;
was killed. Immediately afterward C'as- j
ey left the other two. The theory held j
fey the police is that I^e then became j
alarmed also and demanded his share, of
\u25a0what had been stolen, intending to seek
new and independent fields.
When his last follower expressed a
desire to leave him the desperate An
.Â£rew6 became incensed. He refused an
equal division and the pair quarreled.
During the dispute Andrews struck his
"pal" on the head with a hammer.
Stunned by the blow and in a half- j
tfelirium L<-e siag-gered Into a stable. '
where he told the weird story of v nan j
end a \u25a0woman who lured him to the j
house to kill hipv When his mind be
came more lucid, however, he back
f.red on many of his statements. Should
Andrews be captured it would only in
sure Lee's conviction with him.
\u25ba Self-preservation is the only motive
that keeps Lee from telling- all he
knows about the crook who tried to
murder him.
The instruments and acids for disposing j
of a body were not intended for Lee. They
were kept in the house for some wealthy
victim whom the four crooks planned to
ensnare. The police expect to get full de
tails from Lee when his condition permits
of his being sweated.
So certain are the local police that An
drews, Casey and the woman are in this
city that every avenue of escape is being
watched. Little attention is paid to out
side towns. When the Australian detec
tives arrive full details of the crimes com
mitted there by the quartet will be had
and Identification will be made certain.
The police believe also that the Austral
ian detectives can throw, sogie light on
the identity of the woman. *
William Lee, alias Ellis, was well
known around the California Hotel bar.
He used to drop in there frequently, and
always wanted to get up a "little game
cf cards." He was successful and gen
erally came out winner. The stakes
played for were not large, but his win
rings managed to support him and en
abled him to pay back the small sums
of money that he borrowed from the dif
ferent people In the hotel.
In one of his games Lee roped In a
man by the name of Corey who was
ctaying at the hotel, and less time than
that It takes to tell Corey was out $30.
w Ke had asked Corey to Join in a little
*game 'Just for pastime and tha drinkÃ."
This ended Ellis' playing at the hotel and
rext time he* turned up there his recep
tion was so frigid that he took the hint
end kept away. -; â¢ '
ELLIS INVOLVES HI3ISELF.
His Stories Kow Make a Mue of Con
tradictions.
BKRKELSY, Oct. 14. â Inspired by a
suspicion that William Ellis, turfman
of Australia, who so narrowly escaped
being: butchered by Milton Franklin
Andrews last Wednesday, has not yet
revealed all that he knows of Andrews'
< j-hninal record, the detectives now at
-..ork in Berkeley on the extraordinary
case devoted their energies principally
to-day to the tusk of clearing up the
maze of partially conflicting statements
which the injured man has made since
his removal to the Roosevelt Hospital.
Lllis to-day made a flat denial that
!ic ever had said Andrews admitted hav
lâ¬jg killed a wsman in Colorado â a
Kutemont which was given out by the
o>tc*tives j'etterday as having come
.straight from Hills' lips. The question
was put to him to-day in this form:
-Did Andrews ever tell you at any
time that he had 'done* or killed a wo- |
man, his wife, in Colorado after she had ,
niade an alleged attempt to shoot him?"
To this query Ellis answered to-day
\u25a0with the monosyllable "No."
Yet Detective Jamison, who had a
thirty minutes' talk with Ellis yester
day, gave It ottt at the conclusion of
the interview that Ellis admitted know
ing that Andrews had "done" a woman
k ip Colorado, who was his wife at the
time. Jamison is regarded as highly
trustworthy.
Detective Jamison was thoroughly
puzzled to-<3a.y by the apparent contra
diction in Ellis* statements of yester
-â¢<. -* -. in Him mmatmn\il IT~ -

cay atid to-day, and. atter-npted an ex
planation ot.it as- follows:
DETECTIVE IS POSITIVE.
"Kills j.-csteruay c-ortainly conveyed.
j t!>e Jni*<reasidii to me' thathe knew. An
i drews uu<l'ki'lleil a woman in Colorado,
j and that the woiiiaawis his wife at
that time, obtained the information
from Andrews himself, he tsald. ami,
while Andrews had. not told him in su
many words 'that, the woman had been
murdered by him (Andrews), Â«the infer
ence was hardly rnistakable.
"Ellis* version' of tills 'feature of his
s conversation *.vith Andrews, as given
! to rr;e yes-terday. was that in a clever,
j rather crooked fashibivAndrews had let
him know of the murder of the Colo
rado woman. Andrews certainly .toM
him th.it he had had trouble with his
â¢>vife in Colorado, that they had quar
reled violently, that' the woman tried
to shoot him. that^ she died soon after,
and that while pneumonia was ostensi
bly the cause of her death Andrews [
himself really was responsible for her
taking off."
The talk of Kessic Bouton having died
of pneumonia, suggests to the police
that Andrews may have perpetrated a
grhastly joke in ascribing her death to
such a cause after he had murdered the
woman and left her nude body on the i
top of Mount Cutler, near Colorado I
Springs. Pneumonia, say the police,
might naturally result from exposure
of an uncl.no body on a. lonely mountain
top, and this may have been Andrews'
little joke, perpetrated on Ellis, when
he told him his wife had "died of pneu
monia."
SPOKE MUCH OF COLORADO.
Ellis admits to-day that Andrews
never hesitated to link his own past
with scenes In and around Colorado
Springs, despite the reluctance a crim
inal might be supposed to feel at iden
tifying his past history with a spot
where he ha<l committed a fiendish
crime.,,
"Andrews often spdke of Colorado
Springs." said Ellis this morning, "and
told me he owned property there, and
that the place had a particular interest
for him because it was at Colorado
Springs that his wife died. Certainly, the
place must have deeply interested him,
if he 'murdered Bessie Bouton in that
vicinity, but it seems extraordinary that
he should speak so fondly of the spot,
under those circumstances."
Kllis' account of the extraordinary char
acter of Andrews' admissions and talk
Is not new or particularly valuable, be
cause all who have been identified with
this car.c have concluded that not only is
Andrews a most -extraordinary criminal
and fiend, but that William Ellis, his
last victim, is also an extraordinary
character, whose relations with Andrews
stamp Mm as being either a confederate
of a man hÂ« knew to be a card sharp,
a murderer, a black leg, or else the will-
Ing vltfJm of one who, he declares, pos
sessed a remarkable, hypnotic influence
over him.
With these contradictions and extraor
dinary idmisslons of Ellis, the police are
led to N adopt the theory that Ellis and
Andrews really were con federates, in a
plan to operate in crooked games in
America that they quarreled over matters
that affected their* own enterprises or had
something to do with Andrews' "wife,"
upon w.iom Ellis has admitted his money
was lavished. ' through Andrews, to pro
vide her with Jewels and fine raiment.
" HIS STANDING 'GOOD. -
The s latement * that has been made : by
San Francisco sporting men that Ellis was
concern id In : a , crooked racing; coup 7in
Australia and was : ruled off Uhe '- turf
there, being"" obliged Yin consequence to
seek n<w pastures, was spoken : of sto5 to
Ellis to-day, and he showed a disinclin

positively, however,"' that he was a mem-

ber in.' good standing of the Kensington
Bookmakers' Club in Australia, and that
his record was clear and good. He urged
all who were concerned to write to Aus
tralia and learn for themselves about his
career and standing in Australia.
A minor detail in which Ellis appears
to have contradicted himself is that
while yesterday he referred to Andrews'
deformed chest as having been, accord
ing to Andrews, a misfortune that he had
borne "from birth, to-day Ellis says An
drews told him his chest was injured
in a railroad wr?fck.
Ellis - reiterates that on last Monday
night he stayed at the house.. occupied by
Andrews, in Berkeley, and, that for sev
eral hours Andrews discussed with him
methods by which mQneycould be made,
"bunko" ar.d burglary being only two of
the various means suggested by Andrews.
Ellis was invited to become- a burglar
and a professional crooK by Andrews
and Berkeley was referred to as an ideal
'community which would be easy to in
vade and fruitful in spoil.
To Jhese overtures. Ellis says, ~he was
not responsive, but dreaded to appearre
sentful, Andrews having such hypnotic
or magnetic influence iver him -that it
was impossible to oppose directly his pro-.
, posals. i
TALK OF CROOKED WORK.
Ellis had been assured by Andrews be
fore coming to. America, . he said to-day,
that in America opportunities ; for. money
making were abundant. When Ellis
asked to be told in exact terms last Mon
day Just. what these golden opportunities
were, Andrews replied with a suggestion
that- burglary and other crooked work
would produce. the gold.' \u25a0 . ; ./ â¢' \u25a0
To such suggestions tUlis insists that
he -was not at all favorable -.and.' that:' it
was on this night he determined W at
once - cut loose from the 'man - and \ his
wife, who had been- such intimate friends
with him in: Australia ana* aboard; the
steamship eh i route, for America. It, was
that night, after hearing # this lurid talk
from Andrews regarding . criminal \u25a0: meth
ods of .T making 'money, 'that j Ellis .lay
awake most of the \u25a0 night, listening to
whispers from --ndrews'-and his wife in
the adjoining. bedroom t and frightened at
the; thought ; that .he was fn such -close
proximity to : a" man he perceived was a
cold-blooded,' "desperate crook..' .
"Next day, Ellis says, Andrews^ treated
the .conversation of the ; night ~ before
lightly,,' declaring that', he ;,v.as merely
testing Ellis; while proposing ; the crooked
work, all he'desired being assurance fhat
Ellis, ; indeed,':, was 1 not! Inclined to; crook
ed vrork,' as â¢. -Vat- crook -.would 1 ' never do
business â¢- with him :, (Andrews)." ,â¢ .
TRIED TO POISON- ELLIS.
\u25a0. A queer :.liature' of Ellis' story: to-day
In his reference to a bottle" of poison given
to, him by Andrews on last -Monday night
In the house at Berkeley.' Ellis says that
after' complaining of .a sore T throat. An
drews .produced a bottle or permanganate
of. potassium,.. afpolsonS. >vhlch he'sug
gested, that JS'lis drink. The stuff 'ls used
by people v.'ho desire a mouth wash and
for such purpose may 'be harmless, but
Ellis insists that. Andrews proposed that
he drink the liquid v v.-nich would, of
course, have produced death^ Ellis did
not drink it. The poison label was plain
ly apparent on the bottle and Ellis still
has the bottle.
It has been suggested to the police that
Andrews' present "wife," who. assisted
him in the attempt to murder Ellis last
Wednesday, may be Xina Ward Huntley,
who was sent to' San. CJuentln from Los
Angeles in ISOO for one. year for a dia
mond robbery. Her description is said
to tally with the description of Andrews'
present "wife," g^iven by Ellis to the po
lice. No photograph of the Huntley wo
man has been procured here or shown to
Ellis or any Tone else in Berkeley for
Identification purposes.
S. B. Kenfleld, the real estate agent of
Berkeley, who rented the house on. Ells
worth street : to. Andrews, his "wife" and
Ellis on October 3, -has looked at An
drews' portrait, which the police records
contain, and identifies \u25a0 him as the indi
vidual to \u25a0 whom, he rented, the Kllsworth
cottage. vKenfleld's identification is not
so positive,', however, as that of Ellis,*
who, of course,' knew Andrews' features
better than, the real estate agent, and so
made further Identification nothing more
than corroboration of , an -already estab
lished fact; Kenfleld said to-day:
"There are doubts dn. my mind regard
ing Ellis' assumption. of being merely ; a
guest of the Andrews couple, as I un-.
derstand he -he, was. When An
drews came to me to rent the house last
week he was accompanied by the woman
and by Ellis. While Andrews appeared
to be the dominant party :iri the trio, I
observed i that Ellis , was quite as â¢ much
Interested \u25ba in- the matter, apparently, as
Andrews. *' Ellis was ; particularly, con
cerned when : informed .that the couple's
trunks had not been S brought over for
delivery to the house, a3 expected,- and
fussed and fumed a great deal about that.'
He was far from appearing to be merely
a guest |or companion j only of 'Andrews
and . the> woman." I ' supposed he was: as
much in : the renting arrangement . as An
drews."- \u25a0 . :\u25a0\u25a0. ' ;''' '\u25a0'''' : ;â¢. .'

tiKW YORK. Oct. H.â The Press As-
pvciiition. through thÂ« London Tele-
graph. :innouiu.vs that the Board ot I
Trade and Trinity House have ilnally !
t-ojiL-luded a contract with the Marconi j
AVlrehss Telegraph Company, provid- !
ingr.fur the Immediate equipment and j
installation of the Marconi system on
every lighthouse and lightship guard-
ing the coasts of Engrland, Scotland
and Jivland. This important arrange- I
jricii will enable the lightships to com-
inuuicale with one another and with-j
tho slaor* :.y wir^J^ss telegraphy, not
uiily.for the ordinary purposes of light- I
Â«hip s. rvlec but also to report ships in
tiistrts-s. This decision was brought
about as a result of several months'
successful operation on the Kast Good-
win LJgtotthlp, which has already |
proved on several occasions to be of I
\u25a0special utility in reporting: damage
from storm and in securing prompt as-
ei^tanee.
Many attempts wÂ«?re made to connect
and maintain cable communication be-
tween lightships md the mainland, but
the cable proved both so expensive and
uncertain that it was discarded and re-
rlaceÂ«l by the more dependable and less
expensive system of Wireless Tcleg-
raj.hy.
Tikis Marconi installation on the East
Goodwin Lightship was the means of
eaviag a r.ur.ili r of human lives, be-
*UK-s property of considerable value.
I- vJdence in the Admiralty Court shows
that thanks to a single short wireless
n.tfcsage a loss ot $^50.00 to one st^ani-
er was averted. Again, the big sailing
vessel R. F. Mathews was promptly
towed out of danger by the tugboats
Kumtr.oned by a wireless message to
her assistance.
In the case of the French warship
Fujly. which sank off the coast of
Rrkttce. when going down she called
for help by the Marconi service, and
the Gueydon came a distance of eighty
mile* to the rescue and picked up, the
entire crow of two hundred and fifty
persons, then adrift in the open ocÂ£an.
That wireless telegraphy is capable
and <i< stined to become of incalculable-
value to humanity, no one who has
given thought to the subject can doubt.
Light signals are hidden and sound sig-
nals are muffled by fog. which, how-
ever, is no hindrajic? to Marconi Teleg-
raphy. Marconi Wireless is to tht>
ocean what the Bell Telephone is to the
land.
The Marconi system has established
afcrt-ncles in Italy, Norway, Sweden.
Russia-. Holland. Denmark, Iceland, The
Dutch Kast ladies, Austria, Belgium,
India. China, Brazil, Feru." Chill, The
Argentine, Uruguay. Ecuador. Panama,
Prance, Mexico, United States and Can-
ada.
The Marconi sy.Â«terri is in daily ope-
ration between both sides of the Atlan-
tic and all trans-Atlantic steamships
and war vessels at s<ia. Every day now
from Poldhu. England; from Wellfleet,
United States, and from Cape Breton.
Canada, messages are sf>nt to vessels at
sea up to a distance of 2200 miles.
Many of these are news dispatches and
sire printed in daily papers issued each
<3ay on the liners equipped with the
Marconi system. There Is no time
Throughout the trip across whoa a ves-
sf-1 using,th<v wireless cannot be reach-
ed or when she cannot communicate
with her homo office if necessary.
The value of wireless telegraphy was
\u25a0well illustrated a few days ago in the
case of a Wall-street broker, Mr. Hy.
Steele, who, during the trip of the
eteamer St. Louis, became acquainted
â¢with a promoter going to London to
finance a large proposition. After get-
ting- particulars of the deal the tlnan-
cier agreed to furnish the money, but
before signing the contract th<; pro-
moter insisted on the payment of J.SOvO
"earnest" money. Insipid oÂ£. waifng
until the ship "eaeiÂ»l Liverpool i: n<i
taking chances that the promoter
Ti-ould change his mind, hoping to get
better terms from English '-apitalists,
the enterprising broker sent the fol-
lowing wireless message to his office in
Wall street: "Pay at once to American
Steamship Line $5000, instructing
purser St. Louis to pay me."
Th<, money was paid, and a few
hours later tho purser of the St. Louis
received wireless instructions to pay
the New York financier.
Thf- Marconi Company has already
prov* d itsplf a large money earner and
1s In receipt of constantly increasing
revenues. The earnings of the Well-
fieet station alone, working in conjunc-
tion with its co-ordinate station at
Poldhu. Is estimated to be at least
11.500.000 per annum. Many readers of
this paper had the opportunity a few
years ago to.i>uy Bell Telephone stock
at a very low figure. One hundred dol-
lars invented then has increased to over
5200.000 to date. The only difference
botweÂ«n the B*ll Telephone opportu-
nity you missed, and the Marconi op-
portunity you need not miss, is in the
name. Th<Â± time to buy is now. when
Marconi stock can still be had at a
comparatively low price. Your chancu
for profit is in lindingr out that this in-
vestment is a good one, before every-
body else knows it. If Bell Telephone
stock were offered now, at the price it
was sold to early Investors, it wouldn't
last a minute. You would telegraph
the money. Marconi Securities taken
to-day are just as good.
The company is now operating com-
mercially on a large scale and the pro-
fits will soon be. large enough to pay
large and permanent dividends anil
make the market value of the stock
several t:nÂ«s the present selling price.
The Marconi system is a demonstrated
success, and its future is as safe and
fully assured as that of the Bell Tele-
phone. \u25a0 Tho stock is continually in-
creasing in price and going fast." It
won't last much longer. Soon every-
body will want it. It will be no better
then than now. but It will cost more.
Tho last statement furnished by tho
Marconi Company shows that there is
only a small amount of treasury stock
unsold.

HE CALLS IT AGRACH
Enjoys Strange Fame Until
Bertillon Learns That^He
Is a Notorious Criminal
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Oct. 14.â Not since de Rouge
thont fooled ". the" Royal . Geographical
Society, the â¢ Wide .. World Magazine,
and the British public generally by his
fictitious accounts of adventures
-among undiscovered- tribes -of Austral
lan aborigines has there, been such a
successful hoax, as. that by '' which a
young Tyroleso. vagabond- has duped
\u25a0Parisian magistrates/ polyglot savants
and a host of other clever folk. ?>,,
Agostino Rinaldo, to give him his
real name, was arrested by the. Paris
police on a charge of vagrancy. He
was discovered sleeping on a bench,
and his ragged clothing- afforded pre
sumptive evidence that he had been
guilty of that offense among civilized
communities â existing without visible
means of support. That he had been
for some time a stranger to a square
meal was shown by his gaunt frame
and hollow cheeks. There was nothing
in his face to indicate that he was pos
sessed of a particularly shrewd intel
ligence. He looked much like many
other lads who have led a life of vaga
bondage.
As soon as he found he was nabbed ha
concocted a scheme to profit by his ar
rest. Shamming Ignorance of the re-,
mark addressed to him by the minions of
the law, he answered them in an unin
telligible Jargon. Btfore the magistrate,
M. Roty, he pursued the same tactics.
He epoke- volubly, but none of the court
interpreters could make anything out of
it, whereat he appeared much grieved.
Learned philologists and professors of
nearly every known language were equal
ly baffled by his strange tongue.
judge: leakxs language.
Scorning the suggestion that the lad
was an Imposter, the sympathetic Judge
set himself laboriously to work to ac
quire a knowledge of his strange lan
guage. The prisoner, established some
connection between himself and "Amard
Ritard," which the Judge took to be his
name. In the same way he arrived at
the opinion that the tongue which he
spoke was called "Agrach."
The Judge spent several hours daily
with his prisoner, compiling an Agrach-
French dictionaiy. He would draw a pic
ture of a horse, a house or a tree and
jot down the name which the youth gave
to it. By this linguistic kindergarten
method he fashioned some sort of history
of the lad, frcm which it appeared that
at one time he had lived in the midst of
a forestâ a forest where the tiger roamsâ
by the side of a river. In a steamer with
two funnels he had crossed the ocean
and the rest was a dark mystery.
RinalUo. meanwhile, _ became the hero
of the hour. The Judge supplied . him
with food from his own private table
and replaced his rags with a good suit
of clothes. Ha held receptions daily to
which learned men resorted to acquire a
smattering of Agiach. All sorts 'of
theories were ventilated in the press to
account for him. That which found most
acceptance was that he was some species
of sa\ - age who had escaped from the
tutelage of Colonel Cody's "Wild West"
Ehow, which had been traveling recently
In France.
If "it had not been for the telltale
finger Jirints which have proved the un
doing of so many clever rogues Rinaldo
might still have been living In. clover,
with the prospect of some day becoming
the author of a rival to Esperanto or
Volapuk. While the magistrate was
coddling him, M. Bertlllon, the chlef*of
the anthropometrical department of the
French police, took an impression of his
finger orints and then started a search
among the criminal archives ,for dupli
cates. The denouement was 'somewhat
dramatic. â¢ . \u25a0
BERTH-LOST EXPOSES FAKE.
M. Roty was telling several persons of
the progress he 'had made in mastering
Agrach. He had ascertained by means of
pictures that the mysterious stranger
not only recognized a horse, but knew
how to ride one. And that afternoon he
had invited the lad to accompany him on
a ride in the Bois de Boulogne, from
which he anticipated, among other
things, a considerable enlargement of
his Agrach vocabulary. Then he sum
moned the youth into the room and ejac
ulated something that sounded like "Jig
gery jaw jampot." He told the company
that was. Agrach fon'"How do you do?"
The lad replied in words which tho mag
istrate' had not heard before and which
he hurriedly added to the reams of fools
cap which contained his embryo Agrach-
French dictionary. At this juncture M.
Bertillon rushed into the room.
"I have found the scoundrel out!" he
fxclalmed. Then turning td the youth,
whose face had not revealed the slight
<st indication that he - understood the
meaning 1 of the words, he went on, "Your
name Is Agostino Rinaldo and you are
from the Austrian Tyrol. You have been
arrested several times. You servfd your
last term of Imprisonment in Marseilles."
He proceeded to give a list of various
petty offtnses for w..iCh Rinaldo had
been imprisoned by the French police. Be-,
fore he finished speaking the lad realized
that the game was up. But it was not
penitence that caused him to burst Into
tears. It was the knowledge that the
good things that had been showered upon
him would be withdrawn and he would be
thrust forth into a hard, cold world again
to make a living by his wits, and that
Agrach would not serve him a second
time. He acknowledged that that lan
guage was a medley of thieves' lingo,
Italian and German slang and words of
his own Invention.
Among his dupes are several learned
philologists and it will be a long time be-

gramme that shall further Increase
Germany's defensive resources against
Great Britain. Popular distrust of
Great Britain has naturally swollen to
great proportions and the semi-of
ficial denials in London can scarcely
oVercome the convictions now formed
that Germany has had a narrow escape
from a war, which, although she would
have been . victorious on land, would
have resulted In he*r being crushed at
sea and damaged along the coast, with
the consequent destruction of her over
st& commerce. 'The events of the last
four months have silenced the oppo
nents of a naval increase, except the
Socialists and Radicals.
While time and money beyond Ger
man's resources would be necessary to
equal Great Britain's present navy, not
to speak of her future buildings, yet
the feeling is that Germany must, for
defensive reasons, build as many more
ship's as the country finances will bear.
The Government some months ago de
cided to introduce in the Reichstag a
measure substituting large for small
cruisers in the authorized naval pro
gramme. Whether \u25a0 the " Government
will increase the recommendations be
yond this or not is not yet known.
PARIS, Oct. 14.â Public opinion has
been wrought up during the present week
by alleged revelations of Great Britain's
readiness to invade Germany on behalf of
France. These revelations, following the
Franco-German controversy -over Moroc
co and the open declaration of Prince
Bulow, the German Imperial Chancellor,
favorable to a Russo-German rapproche
ment, created a feeling that France was
the center of dangerous enmities and
coalitions. Although the alleged dis
closures did not receive the slightest of
ficial recognition, they became the theme
for discussion throughout Europe and the
Intimations that former Foreign Minister

riohe the less served, to excite intense
political bitterness in' the highest . cir
cles and disclosed the sensitiveness of
French statesmen to the maneuvers of
various European* powers to readjust
their ententes at the expanse of France.
From the mass of contradictory revela
tions and denials, the fact stands out
that the Morocco" controversy took Ger
many and France dangerously near the
verge of war, and that Great Britain,
while not officially promising military
aid, stood ready to give France her loyal
support The bitterness aroused by the
incident is indicated by the calling of a

BIG TRINITY TUNNEL.
WILL TURN RIVER
Great Project to Save
Gold Is Now Half
Completed.
Important Question Is
/ Raised in Court
in Alaska '
Exr Judge E. A. Belcher, who has Just
returned, from Trinity County, reports
that the big " tunnel which will drain
Trinity River for three-quarters of a
milo and with the aid of a deflecting dam
lay bare the river bed for chat distance
and enable miners to dig the gold that
is supposed to be in' the sands to the
amount of millions of dollars, is half
completed. The works are at Horseshoe
Bend and T. H. Seward, A. W. Lindsay
and Henry Anderson have them in
charge. The tunnel when llnlshed will
be 430 feet long. In driving the tunnel a
.great quantity of talc has been encoun
tered, necessitating much timbering. Not
withstanding all difficulties the work is
half done.
Mr. Belcher says that the most recent
discoveries and the most promising min
ing region in Trinity County are on the
New Kiver, about sixteen* miles from
Hawkins Bar and about sixty-five milea
from Eureka. Placer mining has been
carried on there in a small way since
the early days, but- all of. the lodes, are
recent discoveries. Several very prom
ising discoveries have been made this
year.
The La .Grange hydraulic mine, about
four miles from Weaverville, has made
a larger output thl3 year under the man
agement of Pierre Bourery than during
any previous season. The la3t clean-up
amounted to $70,000. The water was re
cently turned oft and new Humes are
being put in preparatory to next season's
work. Unusually low water has retarded
mining greatly throughout the summer
and fall within the water sheds of the
Trinity and Klamath : rivers.
Trie Hupp & McMurray placer on the I
outskirts of Weaverville has had a good j
run for the season. One of the most!
promising lode claims In Eastern Trinity,
Mr. Belcher says. Is the Bonanza King,
hitherto worked in a small way for some
years with a -cannon ball , mill. Next
spring James H. Porter, the superintend
ent, will put In a ten-stamp mill and the:
property will be developed extensively.
The Qulmby Creek Company has re
cently placed a nine-stamp mill on Its |
property and the stamps will begin drop
ping as soon as there is water sufficient
to drive the machinery. The Bear Tooth
mine has been thoroughly opened under
the management of F. P. Burris, the prin
cipal owner. The Intention is to place a
stamp mill on the property at once.
The ore of all the New River mines
in the vicinity of Burris assays very high,
Belcher says, some of it hundreds of dol
lars a ton. So far, within, the widely
extended zone, It is free milling.* It is
expected that the cyanide and other pro
cesses will- become necessary when deep
v/orkings \u25a0 are reached. Even though
slightly refractory ores should be en
countered there will be no difficulty In
treating them by. simple methods. .
Concerning operations In the Siskiyou
mining districts the Yreka Journal re
ports as follows:
The new quartz mill and cyanide' plant ; at
the Mono mine on Punch Creek, a tributary of
Humbug, just over: the mountain, west, of
Yreka, has been completed, and work will be
commenced in a f ew . days. : W. A.-Chamber
lain has been obliged to put in a large pump
at tho Black I Lead mine on Greenhorn. Just
above the old Blue Gravel claim, ". as the water
was too heavy to handle otherwise.
The Seattle parties bonding tha^ Greenhorn
Blue Gravel mine have organized a company
under the name of the Yreka Blue Gravel Min
ing: Company.'- ' -\ -:.

mining section in the, world. . I. invested therein
on the '.representations' of , ; John McKane,* and
with the â¢ utmost confidence, and the '. outcome
has convinced me ' that the : investment was
well made.' ' I am also confident that \u25a0 the next
, year will record a vastly increased output from
the mines of this entire mineral belt, and, be
lieve me, the world has become awakened to
this fact.
It is our Intention to push the exploitation
of our. properties as rapidly a 9 is possible un- '.
der the present facilities for handling the i
product; and one of the main purposes cf my !
present visit Is to look into the advisability j
of establishing a smelter somewhere in this \
section for the treatment .of. the ores mined in â¢
our properties. This plan, however, is as yet 1
embryonic, and I am unable to state- at this;
time just what the result will be in that re
upect. Mr. McKane is the arbiter In the mat- i
ttr, and whatever he advocates In the way of â¢
improvements at our mines and In the line |
of. future investments will meet with my ap- '.
proval. It is our purpose to visit our holdings â¢
at Bullfrog, which include the Great Eastern !
group and other*, and I may state that any- \
thing in the: way of profitable mining invest
ment that may be offered us will receive con- |
slderate attention. . ' . . ;
- Near Sumner Hot Springs, in Kern ;
County, several â¢ locators have recently!
filed claims. Four mines will be pros- â¢
pected. One of the claljns is supposed (
to be rich in tungsten. I |
The old Midas mine in Harrison]
Gulch will be improved largely. \
The Redding Searchlight reports that '
G. F. ICendall, consulting engineer for J
the American Lead Corporation, ha 3 i
been inspecting the Bullychoop mining,
property. From this it is inferred by
the Searchlight that large operations
â¢are in prospects \u25a0 .\u25a0
Progress has been made at the Ban
ner mine. The , Miner-Transcript re
ports that the wateV in the north shaft
â¢ has been lowered to a point fifty feet
below the 400-foot level. The south
shaft has. been drained to the depth of \u25a0
340 feet. As soon as the ,water is out
the shaft will be carried down to a depth ;
of 1200 feet. Senator Belshaw is in- j
terested in the property. j
An attempt will be made by parties !
In interest to raise sufficient funds, to
liquidate the indebtedness of the New
York-Grass Valley mine in Nevada
County. J. W. Heisner and Edwin
Fernald have gone East to interview
the principal stockholders. At a re
cent meeting the old board of directors
was re-elected. It is probable that the
property will be further developed.
WICKERSHAM DECIDES.
Judge Wickersham has delivered a
mining decision in Alaska that has
wide application and has, according to.
the Fairbanks News, settled the ques-. [
tion aa to what constitutes a discovery J
of mineral under the' location laws, i
This; phase of the matter is of very;
great Importance to people in Califor- |
nia who -have made locations. The I
News. -reports the following general
facts relating, to the case, which was
entitled Kinghorn et al. vs. Audrak,
Semply, McQueen. et al.:
No case before the court has taken uo more
time, or has been more bitterly contested. It
was a four-sided- fight for mining ground on
Cripple Creek st the mouth of Esther- Creek.
There were so many conflicting interest* that
even the attorneys on those most directly In
terested have apparently become confused In \u25a0
trying to follow all of its devious windings
and turnings through the mass of law which
has been brought to bear upon the question. I

tevant case. In this the contention is between
two groups, as well aa against the individual
locator â the Sturtevant case hetnz a group
against an individual. Here the groups over
lap each other. The ground was first taken up
as separate mining claims. Then came a group
party and located the same ground, and an
other group party located adjoining ground,
which overlapped this ground. Sturtevant was
interested In No. 11. Esther Creek, and his
claim was included In the original group, but
he wa* awarded the decision, after a sensa
tional trial, and now has possession of that
1 claim.
The Judge. In dismissing the case, said thar
I he had lately come into possession of a ruling
i from the Supreme Court and this, togetner
; with the fact that he had become better ac
| qualnttd with tae conditions, made him feel
! disposed to modify some of the points laid
j down In former decisions^ " The seven reasons
' for dismissing the case are here given, but
I the principal Interest contained therein Is the
! fact that he Indicates that one discovery for
; eight claims will no. longer serve â there must
j be a discovery for every separate claim.
! 'While his remarks In dismissing the case
i before him may not have the force of a formal
! opinion, yet they indicate what is to be cx
i pected when that question Is regularly up for
i determination. , .
The principal bone of contention at' the out
set was, "What constitutes' a discovery of
mineral under the location laws?"' It was !n
the famous Sturtevant surtace discovery case,
tried during the early pan of the term, that
| the court decided that a eweovery of colors on
' the surface was sufficient to hold a. mining
claim. \u25a0 After the decision in this case, the
plaintiff was indicted before the Grand Jury,
and. after an exciting ann highly rensattoail
trial, he was acquitted on the charge of per
jury. But the case had Its deslrea effect; the
\u25a0 question was as to whether or not muck, cr
whatever the substance Is which lays on top of
bedrock, carries gold, was determined. Export
after expert testified that colors or prospects
could be found almost any place along the
creeks in this vicinity. Then the question came
squarely to the court. "Does the mere finding
of colors of gold create a discovery _cf mineral.
; under the mineral laws of the United States?"
i The first case In which this question arose af
; ter the Sturtevant case was the case which in
] volved a conflicting townslte as against a con
flicting mining claim. It was not tried before
the court, but by the Jury. However, the court

must be such as would warrant a prudent man-

This instruction was at the time regarded as
a death blow to what had been known aa sur
face discoveries.
But it Is one thins for the court to instruct
and another thing: for the jury to decide. Tna
Juries ara the Judge 3 of the facts of the cas*.
: and the only power that the court has Is to tell
. them what the law Is. In a case tried a few

in securing control of the State Sav
ings Bank, F. Augustus Heinte can now
regulate the payment of about $600,000,

to the extent of $300,000, and with an
other $300,000 he secured control of the
stock of the bank.
Thomas H. Hodgens is one of the
best known bankers in the Northwest.
The State Savings Bank was organized
In 1890 and is capitalized at $300,000.

TENESSEE GIRL TO ENTERTAIN
AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE
Wins Distinction f as * Negro Impersonator
MEMPHIS GIRL WHO HAS WON DISTINCTION. IN ENGLAND AS AN IMPER
EONATOR OF THE NEGRO AND WHO IS TO APPEAR BY INVITATION BE
FORE THE QUEEN AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Oct. 14. â A pretty girl from
Men phis who makes a specialty of
negro recitations is looking forward
to the honor of appearing in private
before Queen ' Alexandra. This is an
experience to be anticipated with un
common satisfaction, of course, but it
seems to be arousing no special trepi
dation in the bfeast of the fortunate
young woman concerned. As a matter
of fact, Miss Clara Alexander, who
came over to London from New York
about a year ago armed only with cer- [
tain good letters of Introduction, has
had euch an uncommon amount of ar
tistic and social success in' the metrop
olis since that it is not surprising that !
even the prospect .of appearing at
Buckingham Palace does not excite her
unduly. ';. ;'.:'-ir'
Miss Alexander, who does her
"darky" business the better for hav
ing -bÂ«>en born and brought up on a
plantation, has had high compliments
paid ter during her itay In London.
After hearing her recital two or three
times, W. S. Gilbert, the author .of
"Pinafore," advised her strongly to go
in for emotional acting, while Lady
Bancroft,, who before her marriage to
Sir Squire Brancroft was one of the
finest actresses on the stage, told the
American girl that if she would study
the part of the heroine tin "Romeo and
Juliet" she, Lady Bancroft, would
coach her.
If Miss Alexander's "very palpable
hit" In London had been made on the
theater or music-hall stage, no doubt
quite a lot about it would have been
published In the United States. But
what goes on in drawing-rooms, espe
cially in as fashionable drawing-rooms
as those in which this American girl's
recitals have been given, is not re
ported to any extent, and so her suc
cess has hardly been mentioned in the
newspapers. When she recited at Lady
Ludlow's, who had lent her charming
house in Portland Place to. the Tennes
see girl for that purpose, the tickets
were sold at the fashionable price, of
one guinea â $5. Miss Alexander, has ap
peared before royalty already, a recital
of hers having been attended by Prin
cess Christian, wh \u25a0 those who heard
her recently at ' Gilbert Farquhar's, In
Hempstead, Included Prlne Victor" and
Princess Dhuleep Singh, Princess Low
enstein, the Marchioness of Tweeddale
and the Earl ofMunster. , \u25a0
Miss Alexander gives negro poems,
stories and monologues, and -It Is
doubtful If the thing has ever been
done better, on this side of the water,
at least. It. ls no small thing to move
a London fashionable drawing-room
crowd to tears, as she has sometimes
succeeded in doing, and so unimpres
sionable a granddame as Mrs? John
Mackay declares that she" never in her
life had been more .deeply,, touched
than by one of, the ; Memphis girl's reci
tations. ' -i*-
It was Mrs. Mackay, -to. whom one of
Miss Alexander's | American letters of
introduction was addressed.: who.
launched her over here. \ Since then
she has been in such constant demand
for smart functions thai she has hardly
had time: to fill them all and to accept
all the purely social invitations of
.which she has been the recipient,^She
is frequently, the. guest lot. Lady- in
gram.Ywhose husband owns the*lllus

and â¢ Mrs. T. P. O'Connor. /. Lady ; Ludlo w,

a few amendments to the rules to en

. Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 14.â Lillian, Russell
took the ticket speculator nuisance
her own hands to-day. The loud-voiced

of the theater heavily veiled.
"The : last twenty seats in the house-^
here -they areâ sl 50 each," shouted a
"buccaneer,", holding out a wad of tick
ets. '
Miss Russell reached for *' the' bunch of
pasteboards and threw. them into the win

return the purchase money, to ; the holder.
The husky speculator tried - L to argue
back his tickets ; from the . cage of . the
seller, but all he got was his money back.
Finally an equally husky porter threw
him out of the entrance.

; Loyal to Its
- GnieL
Demands for His Res
ignation Are to
Be Ignored.
Claim Ma,de That, Whatever
His Sins, Thsy Were Not
Due to Cupidity.
NEW YORK, Oct. 14.â The directors of
the : New " York Life Insurance Company
have decided to stand by John A. McCall,
president of the company. No official ac
tion has yet been taken. formally to that
effect, but .the announcement may. be ac
cepted _as none the less authoritative that
a large majority of the board has in
formally resolved to sustain McCall in his
position, despite the tremendous pressure
brought to bear for his removal, In the
form of letters from policy , holders and
resolutions of . various organizations de
manding: his withdrawal from the presi
dency. O-i't_
This decision on the.part of the direc
tors does not mean that all of them ap
prove, or.â¬ven condone, some of the acts
of the McCall . administration recently
made public through the legislative insur
ance inquiry. Many members of the
board have professed surprise and . deep
regret to learn of the diversion of money
paid to Republican campaign funds on the
sole responsibility" of .McCall and Perkins.
Nor do they approve of the methods em
ployed in devoting large sums to the in
fluencing of legislation through "Judge"
Andrew Hamilton, nor of the lax system,
or lack of system, whereby "Judge" Ham
ilton has been permitted to hold hundreds
of thousands of dollars without making
any proper accounting therefor.
Members Af the board, however, main
tain that, while McCall may have been
guilty of errors of judgment and sins of
omission, there has been no scintilla of
evidence to show that he has in any way
profited selfishly at the expense of the
company. In the matter of syndicate par
ticip" tlons, for instance, they hold that
his r< ord remained unblemished, while
that of .Lher insurance officials has suf
fered severely, as the result of personal
interest. Â»n such deals^. They are;*dis
posed to belieVe /that.^whateve'r'Tiis 1 'de
relictions in the- management of affairs,
cupidity prompted none of them!

BRITONS MOURN
IRVING'S DEATH
News' of the Sudden Demise
of Veteran Actor Is Be
ceived With Great Sorrow
3IAN Y FLOBAL TBIBUTES
Suggestion Is Made That the
Body Be Buried in Poets'
Corner, Westminster Abbey
LONDON,. Oct. 14.â The bodyof Henry
Irving will reach London at 3:20 o'clock
to-morrow morning. It wiir be \u25a0: con
veyed here on a funeral car attached to
the regular train from Bradford; ac
companied . by his sons, Henry B., and
Lawrence, and Bram Stoker "and other
members of his business staff'and-per
toiial friends." Immediately on its ar
rival the body wilf be taken to Irving' s
residence. Notwithstanding the re
quests that no flowers be sent,, several
lnagniticent - J designs" have' already
leached Bradford and have been given
a place on the coffin.
Flags were placed aj halfmast on
many of the theaters in' London to-day
and the afternoon and evening per
formances in the theaters throughout
the country closed with the orchestras
playing a dead march. At the Queen's
Hall concert Chopin's "Funeral March"
was played, the vast audience standing.
Ellen Terry, who is playing, at
Birmingham, is reported to, be com
pletely prostrated with grief : and did
not appear at to-nignt's performance. ,
A meeting will be. held in London
at which a proposition tor a natlpnal
memorial will take shape. It is u"n-^
derstood to be extremely probable that
Sir Charles Wyndham will propose the
endowment of a national theater in
Irving's name. /.-â¢
Seldom has the death of a public man
in England called out such a general
expression of sorrow as has 'followed
the tragically sudden demise of Sir
Henry Irving. Appreciations, histories
of his career, and stories of his many
sided activities fill the newspapers. His
last words- on the stage as the curtain
was run down on the death, of Becket,
"Into thy hands, O Lord,' into thy
'hands," were the last he uttered, as he
never spoke after his collapse in the
hall of the hotel where he died.
During the performance of "The
Bells" at Bradford on Thursday, the
veteran actor delivered many passages
seated, instead of his customary free
dom of movement on the stage. Once
or twice last night, toward the close of
the performance, Sir Henry was seen
tp support himself on the stage, .but
in response to the recalls of the au
dience he appeared before the curtain
and acknowledged the cordiality of his
reception.
In view of the doctor's certificate,
the Coroner decided that an inquest
was not necessary.
Ellen Terry was greatly distressed at
the news of Irving's death. .She said:
"I know -all this has happened as he
wisFed. "He worked to the very last "In
full possession- of his faculties, ir re
joices me that he finished his* evening's
work. His last words on ; the stage
were: . : ' v '
i "/Through night to light. * -
"''lnto thy, hands, O Lord, into thy
hands.' , \ -. ;.'; .'- -.-' \u25a0\u25a0* -': 'Â£ '
"His last expressed wish, the wish of
his life, was for a municipal theater,
where everything would be of the first
order; where the standard of true
drama, as distinguished from miscel
laneous entertainment, -would- be suc
cessfully upheld. A realization of this
wish would be a fitting monument to
him."
Suggestions are heard In some quar
ters that the burial take place In West
minster Abbey, iri poets' corner, w.here
lie the bodies of Garrick, Mrs. Siddons
and other theatrical celebrities.

NEW YORK. Oct.? 14.â The Herald
says the following letter received, from
Actor James K. Hackett, inclosing $50
for himself and his wife, known on the"

voices a wish that was in "the. mind
of very many men and women -within
and without the profession when they
heard the news of Sir Henry Irving's
death. , ..
To the EditOf of thÂ«Her*ld: Sir 'Henry
Irj-lng was so essentially an International fig

lantic as on the other, that It seÂ«ms to me
a great pity that, owinÂ« to the distance be

eands of his admirers in this country should
be unable to pay the tribute" to his memory
which they would have offered had this great
man passed c.way. on American soil. Would
the New York Herald act : as custodian of
any sums ot money, no matter â¢ how email,
that might be cent. not only by the mem
bers of his own profession I but the . general
public as well, the proceeds '"to be devoted
to the purchase Jn London of a suitable, floral
ofterinz as a slight token of. affection' and
' tsteem from his American admirers, to be
in evidence side by side 3 with . those of . hia
own countrymen when the last Bad rites take
place in England, thousands ofmles : away â
because, : ilk? I Shakespeare. Irviny's person
ality belongs to the world? â¢ - :
Should the suggestion meet with your ap
proval pleaee seoept \u25a0 checks of J25 each, from
Mrs. Hapkett and myself, although personal
ly I have mail" a ; small- offering " as
probably have many of my professional breth
ren. Furthermore, if I can be of service on

that may be deemed wise. * Moat sincerely, .

The Herald has replied to Mr.

JAIL FOR LIFE
IS THUG'S FATE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
UKIAH. Oct. 14. â Last night a jury
brought in a verdict of guilty in the
case of Charles Jones or Stevens,
charged with the murder of Frank
Drake In this county last year.
Jones, with two companions named
Kinlay and Lambert, killed Drake in
an attempt to rob him. They were not
suspected, iind were witnesses here at
the examination of a suspect, who
proved an alibi. They disappeared aicer
the examination and suspicion was
not directed their way until the wom
an with whom they lived began to talk.
After a lung chas^ Finlay was
vaught in Colusa County. A month
later Lambert was captured in Oregon.
Last August Jones was caught in
Washington. Finlay was convicted and
sent up Tor life, lie was shot In the
Folsom outbreak. Lambert pleaded
guilty and also got a life sentence. The
jury in the Jones case recommended
life imprisonment.
Jones is the son of a Tennessee min
ister. His father wanted to come nere
to defend his son and offered every
tinancial aid. Â»
Jones' conviction rids Mendocino
County of three desperate characters
who lived by gambling and other ques
tionable means. It is believed by many
that Ffr.lay killed an express messen
gfr at Meyer two years ago in an at
tempted stage hold-up.

BOILER SCALES
Special Dispatch to The Call
VALLEJO, Oct. 14. â The court-mar
tial of Commander Lucien Young of the
Bennington continues its weary way at
the Mare Island navy yard. Lieuten
ant Commander F. \V. Bartlett was
again on the witness stand all day.
The most important ruling made dur
ing to-day's session was that giving
the board's consent to a request that
a pint of the scales taken from boiler
B, which were forwarded to the Navy
Department at Washington by the
board of inquiry that sat at San Diego
be sent "for. This request was made
by the defense. Its purpose was not
made clear, but it is believed there is a
desire to compare the scales obtained
from the safety valves of the boiler
which brought such damage with those
from boiler C, which were on exhibi
tion at the court session to-day. Two
employes of the navy yard opened the
safety valve of boiler. C to-day. It
was examined thoroughly by the coun
sel, the witnesses and the members -of
the court.
Counsel Evans again attempted to se
cure an opinion from Bartlett to-day
by which he could have the expert's
testimony thrown out, but the watch
fulness of Advocate West, who ob
jected to the question, asked the wit
ness regarding the quantity of water
in the safety valve of boiler B at the
time that the Bennington was at sea,
foiled Evans. V.'est did not desire
Bartlett to impeach himself by answer
ing this question, as it was of no par
ticular interest to the court and Bart
lett does not pretend to be an expert In
this particular.
The feature of the day's proceedings
was the appearance of Ensign Charles
T. Wade in the ante-room of the court.
He appeared to be well and strong and
was accompanied by Past Assistant
Surgeon Smith, under wliose care he
has been since he was stricken with ap
pendicitis. Wade was not allowed In
the courtroom, as it is the policy of the
board to exclude all witnesses, but he
held a levee in the big library, which
is used as an ante-room to the court
Wade is on almost as friendly terms
with the members of the court as Com
noÂ»nder Young, whose daily greetng is
a handshake with each and every mem
ber of the court previous to the com
mencement of the day's session.

NEW YORK, Oct. 14.â The bank
statement proved an enigma again to
day, as has come to be expected, owing
to the largu share in banking opera
tions by institutions outside tne clear
ing-house, which do not report results
to be included in the bank statement.
The stook market remained so impas
sive on the appearance of the statement
that tluctuations were feeble, with the
closing easy at small declines.
The bank statement's showing of a
decrease in loans of $29,456,600 makes a"
record, with the sole exception of the
reduction for the lirst week of Septem
ber. Repayments Jof temporary bor
rowings by the city of New York with
the proceeds of u.e yearly tax*Â»ayments
figure in the showing.
The stock market has indicated some
A.quidation during the week, but noth
ing like the flguro reported in the
bank statement. Preliminary estimates
of the cash change, based on figures
supplied by the oanks themselves,
promised an increase of about $1,000,
000, while the bank statement shows
an actual decrease of $2,350,800. No
explanation Is offered for the dis
crepancy except as it may represent a
rectincation of previous statements,
which has shown unexplained growth
In the cash reserves. The foreign ex
change market was unusually strong
for a Saturday. ,-
Sterling exchange declined at Paris
again and a small^arcel of gold was
withdrawn from the Bank of England
for shipment to France. Sterling ex
change reacted slightly at Berlin.- but
discounts advanced again at that cen
ter, at Paris and at London. The in
ternational pressure for gold is shown
to be fully maintained by these de
velopments.

Prices have moved irregularly through
the week In a dull market and did not

for money hdve moved upward In all.
great centers of capital on account of
encroachments upon reserves for pur
poses of circulation and coincident
large demands for credits.
The course ot the money market dur
ing the week has reinforced the coun
sel of caution in speculative extension.
Tne Hank of Knprland refrained from
advancing its discount rate, and it was
reported that the Bank of France was
parting with gold for Egypt to relieve
the larse drain on the London rr.on^y
market. Foreign exchange in this
market moved away from the gold Im
port r-oint in response to the higher
money ratos abroad. Rumors were cir
culated of an intended redepbsit In na
tional banks nf : a portion of the Gov
erum^ntv.surplus. but~these failed of
otfiMa.l confirmation. Time money, rates
and. interest on commercial credits
moved upward, and there was some
calling of "loans at the Stock Exchange.
Bonds have moved narrowly on a

FRESNO, Oct. 14.â A lynching was nar
rowly averted here to-day. A party of
enraged -farmers secured a rope ana set
out with the purpose of stringing up a
negro who had attempted to attack a
white woman. The life of the black
brute was saved only through the qulcK
action of a constable, who hurried him
into a buggy and drove at a breakneck
speed to 'Fresno, where the prisoner was
safely lodged in the County Jail.
The negro, Herbert Flnley, lives with
his family on a small farm near Fowler.
A half-mile away reside the Klime fam
ily. A few days ago the husband and
father weijt on a trip to Los Angeles and
yesterday, Finley, meeting . a small
daughter of the house, asked her if her
father was at home and if the -mother

ever, refused to hear the case arid it

the reserves with the State Treasurer

Instead of real : love being such a lady

LONDON'S LORD
MAYOR -ELECT
IS A BACHELOR
LORD MAYOR-ELECT OF LONDON.
WHO WILL BE INSTALLED IN
MONTH OF NOVEMBER.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Oct. 14.â With that prodig
ious gravity which characterizes the per
formance of all their official functions,
London's City Aldermen have once more I
gone through the annual farcical cere- !
mony of "electing" a Lord Mayor. As I
everybody knew would be the case, their
choice has fallen on Walter Vaughan
Morgan, the senior sheriff of the city
corporation. Time was, some centuries
ago, when the citizens of London really
elected their Lord Mayor, but lons since
the Aldermen succeeded in getting things
fixed so that each one of them in turn,
provided he lived long enough, would at
tain to the exalted office of the Civic
Chief Magistrate. And thus it comrs
about that at seventy-four years of age
Walter Vaughan Morgan has had that
dignity thrust upon him. He will be in
stalled on November 9.
For the year that he nils the ofllce he
will reside at the Mansion House. His
chief duties will consist in eating a great
number of official luncheons and dinners,
wearing gorgeous garments, and going
through funny ceremonies with prodigi
ous solemnity. For this he will be paid
a salary of tfiO.OJO. but It" will cost him
at least twice that sum to maintain the
Mansion House traditions of hospitality.
He has. huwever. the consolatipn ol
knowing that during his tenure of- office
he is sure to be knighted and will be
known as Sir Walter for the rest of his
days.
Like all the city fathers. Alderman Mor
gan is a prominent business man. With
five of his brothers he founded the firm
of Morgan Brothers, merchants and
newspaper proprietors, and the Morgan
Crucible Company in 18oÂ«3, resigning for
that purpose the chief oashlership of the
National Provincial Bank's Manchester
branch, in whose service he had be^n for
' ten years. These firms' steady prosperity
has placed Walter Morgan In such com
fortable circumstances that he will hardly .
! be pinched by the heavy demands on his
own private purse, which the office of
Lord Mayor entails. The two firms
stand to-day as they did nearly 50 years
ago, except- that death has reduced the
number of partners from six to three.
Unless Mr. Morgan marries within the
next few weeks, he will be the first
bachelor Lord Mayor in many years.
Pleasant though his blessedness ,
may have been, he must now be wonder
ing* how the traditions of Mansion House
entertaining are to be kept up without
a wife or even a daughter to share the
responsibilities. In the many functions j
which each Lord Mayor is expected to
give hte Lady Mayoress is an important
feature, and unless some lady relative
comes to his rescue, the aged official is
likely to find his social duties rather
heavy.
Besides already holding the ancient of
fice of his Majesty's Lieutenant for the
City, the Lord Mayor-elect is treasurer
of Christ's Hospital, and a Freemason
of many years standing, being a past
grand treasurer of the Grand Lodge
of England.

TO HIGHWAYMAN

experience of a logger employed on the
Pit River has led very probably to the
discovery of a clew by which it is be

ment. . . â¢ .
The foot ' was dressed and the stran
ger related his terrible experience, but
refused to give his name.: He reap
peared at. the doctor's office Saturday
and Sunday for treatment. Sunday he
was perceptibly anxious , to get away,
notwithstanding the serious condition
he was in. He told the doctor to dress
his foot in such a, way. that he could do
a great deal of walking, as he expected
to.be absent about two days. He said
he would have to walk, , but would . not
say where. "â¢'
Tuesday afternoon, the day after: the
robbery, he appeared at_the doctor's of
fice, pale and nervous, his fOQt horrribly
swollen" f rom \u25a0 long ; walking. He asked

had his foot attended to and said he
would be back next day. He j has ; riot
been seen since. * f ;

answering his description and walking
with a cane was seen near Bear "Valley.

tion to-day are now; endeavoring to find

ing and sewering and work thereon has j
begun. Lyon & Hoag also report that
i the .activity in Burlingame sales is j
sustained; that all Indications point to |
increased activity, and that, \u0084 in: the [
opinion of many, 190 C wlll.be the. ban- j
ncr year in the development" of penin
sula property? /This will largely 'be
brought about by the completion of the
Bay Shore cut-off and the. fact that I
land-owners who have heretofore, been
unwilling to cut up their lands are
now selling.

ward the closing up of ...the "gap .be
tween the Western Addition, , which is
now built up to this land, "and a large
district south of the park. The devel
opment of the property in the . vicinity,
of this block is now In .rapid progress.
Close to $500,000 has been expended in
the last two years in a very small ra

HOHTON CASE COMPROMISED.
OAKLAND, Oct 14.â The verdict
given Mrs. Joanna Horton and her son
Charles for $12,500 against the Sunset
Telephone and Telegraph Company for
the death of Horace Horton, who was
killed by one of the company's wires,
was compromised by Attorney Stanley
Moore for $10,000 to-day and the court
gave its official sanction on benalf of
young Horton, who is a minor.
It Is a victory for Moore, who con
ducted the case, which was bitterly
contested, and opened up a new line of
procedure against the company, as it
was held responsible for placing its
wires so near heavily charged electric
wires that it became charged by In
duction and "was a deadly menace to
any one f>ho happened to touch it.
Horton. who lived at 1820 Thirtieth
avenue, was killed while in the act of
tearing the telephone from the wall,
It having become a nuisance by its
ringing and which complaints at "the
office had failed to rectify.

ROOM THIEF WALKS
BOLDLY INTO JAIL
OAKLAND, Oct 14.â A .cunning at
tempt to escape capture for trying to
pick the packets of Bartley Dlreane by
applying for lodgings at the City Prison
in the hope that it would be the last
place where a fugitive from the law
would be sought, resulted, last night in
the capture of Edward Craig, a clever
room thief, who since his arrest has con
fessed to a number of burglaries which
have lately- been reported to the local
police. The authorities are satisfied that
In Craig they have captured a man who
has been causing them a lot of trouble,
and the detectives, are now making a'
careful investigation of the prisoner's
record. -
Craig was seen by Dlreane, who is a
j-oung Irishman^ recently arrived from
the old country- to attempt to enter sev
eral rooms in the St. Lawrence House_
at Seventh and Franklin streets, and a'
moment later as he passed Direane In
the hall, Craig tried to pick the lat
ter's pocket. Direane caught the crook
in the act, and the latter fled. He was
closely pursued, however, and hoping to
escape by a ruse, he went directly to
the City Prison, and asked for a night's
lodging.
Craig had been locked up but a ifew
minutes when Dlreane appeared, having
been unable to find him, and reported the
attempt to rob him. His description of
the man fitted that of Craig, and when
the latter was confronted by Direane,
he broke down and confessed. Among
the houses he said that he had robbed
were those of T. M. Van Slyke, J. Crab
and J. H. Haffee, all in this city.

OAKLAND, Oct 14. â No further word

Tlie First Free Baptist Church feels
that its name snoulu ue cleared' in this
unsavory, mutter und has issued the
following statement:
"\u25a0.Henry A. .Logan. has been a mem
ber of the cnurcn only for ''\u25a0\u25a0 a few;
months, uimseir and wile having been
received by letterfrom the First Bap- :
tist Cnurcn of Sacramento, lie was
never a deacon ut the church nor had
he any authority or influence in spirit
ual matters whatever. His parents'
years ago were members of our church,,
when Henry was a boy, and they are
excellent Christian people.
"A vacancy occurring in our board
of trustees, he was unfortunately elect-,
ed to till out the unexpired term. Some
or our trustees opposed this action at
the- time, but the good standing of his
paVentr and the great esteem' ln which
his excellent Christian wife was held by
thj church prevailed. Boards tf trus
tees in Free Bapist churches have no
authority in spiritual matters, their
duties being . confined entirely to .the
temporalities of the church." A minority
of the'board may be elected from out
side the membership of the church.
"The young lady was a Sunday-school
scholar, who had been assigned to
teach an infant class during the tem
porary absence of the . regular class
teacher. She was a very bright girl
and "the official board (or prudential
committee), who have all authority in
spiritual matters under the direction
of the church, had great hopes of her
accomplishing much good in the world.
The official board had secured for' her
from a benevolent gentleman interested
In the education of the young/ a
scholarship of $25 a term while in the
High School and a large amount per
term while she should be in the unl
versit'yv'"Ttiis^sa'irYe board had done

WANT NEW- CHARTER
FOR MUNICIPALITY
ALAMEDA, , Oct. 14.â Another move
ment to have framed and adopted a
freeholders' charter for this city is to
be Inaugurated with the sanction of
the City Trustees, who, without excep
tion, are in favor of a more compre
hensive and up-to-date organic law for
the governing of the municipality. It
is expected that the first step in the
campaign for the new, charter will be
taken within a few weeks..
- President William J. Gorham . and
William M. Bowers of the. City Trus
tees are ardent advocates' of a .new
charter.* They have outlined a". plan of

tion of a .petition for a mass meeting
of residents and property owners at
which nominations for freeholdersYwill
be. made." The City Trustees will then
be requested to call an election* for the
purpose of choosing those who will
constitute the Board of Freeholders.
Provision was made in the recent
tax levy for the expenses of an elec
tion for freeholders and for a
election. The West End Alameda Im
provement Association has been active
in its advocacy of a new charter and
the subject will be a matter of discus

against the Realty Syndicate and F.
M. Smith for $100,000 damages for the
alleged diversion of water out of Sau
sal Creek by the latter company. It
is claimed by the water company that
it has the right to the, 600.000 gallons
daily from this creek and that the
Realty Syndicate has gone Into the
stream above plaintiff's dam and put in
five dams, besides three tunnels, and
has been diverting the water for three
years past and giving it to people who
have bought land from it in the Pied
mont Heights district.
Sausal Creek runs down through
Fruitvale and empties Into the estuary.
The Contra Costa Company states that
It has had a dam in the creek known
as Sausal Dam for more than twenty
years and that It has been piping water
to the extent of 600,000 gallons dally
from this supply. Lately, however, the
complaint sets forth, plaintiff's pipe
will not fill, owing .to the diversion of
water from the stream above, where its
dam is located. :
The complaint alleges that the Real
ty Syndicate has constructed extensive
works along this creek and built dams
across the creek and tunneled Into it
and has taken off such a supply of wa
ter that the supply has been encroached
upon so that it takes practically all the
water In the creek. Attorney M. C.
Chapman brings the suit on behalf of
the water company.

familiarity that certainly would be un

veyed great amusement to a gToup of his

these words at Patrolman "Gus" Skelly

"Hi there, namesake! You're Skelly.

admitted to Judge Mogan that one
\u25a0evening last week she turned off the
g-as purrent to her. hostelry and. soon
afterward turned it on again, thereby
unintentionally; seini-asphyxlating Mrs.
C. Bower, wife of a rnotorruan. as she
slept in her room. ..' :
The gas was iighetd and Mrs. Bower
awoke when Mr. Bower" went out, but
she dropped Into slumber while'await
ing hia return, and when he did re
turn the jet was pouring deadly monor
ide into the apartment, and hiÂ» better
half was unconscious. He had Mrs.
Bodrru.r arrested for. having violated an
ordinance which, prohibits .the turning
ofT at the meter of gas by any person
, other than the agent of the gas com
; pany.
Mrs. Bodmer pleaded Ignorance of the
ordinance alluded to. and stated" that
she turned^off the gas- to prevent its
extravagant waste by persons who left
it blazing In the 'toilet and bathroom.
On the evening in question she did not
know that -the Jet in the' Bower, apart

slept. ..'-
Patrolman J. J. Barker has. been sum
moned to appear in court to-morrow

\u25a0 G. W. Howe, who advertises that in re
turn for aj $12 fee he is ready to, bring
about the severance of.- the marital bond

rather; uncomfortable quarter of an hour
in Judge Mogan's court, where he ap
.peared as complaining witness in the case
of Francis J. Week, accused of malicious
I mischief, battery and assault to do great
bodily, harm. He was forced to confess
that*the Superior Court of San Fran
cisco had disbarred him from practice be
fore it.
It was in response to Mr. Howe's ad
vertisement that Mr.. Week, recently from
;the interior of. the State, went to the
office at 1122 Market street and engaged
the service of Mr. Howe to. obtain a di
vorce, and he paid $20 for such" service.
Then, he alleges, Mr. Howe demanded
an additional $5 for. advertising suit,
also $5 to defray the cost of fillngMt. and
when Mr. Week refused to pay either
of 'the sums ! mentioned _ and demanded
that his ?20 be returned to him/ Mr.

PRELATE OPENS
CHURCH FAIR
Archbishop Montgomery opened St.
Joseph's Church Fair -last night at St.
Joseph's Hall. Tenth and Howard
streets. A large crowd was present.
Bishop Montgomery delivered a stir
ring address and requested all to work
with a will. y
The funds raised &\ the fair will go
toward the building of a new convent,
to be known as the Holy Name Convent.
The new building will be situated next
St. Joseph's Church, and when com
pleted will be an imposing and lasting
monument to the generosity of the
Catholic people. The fair will last a
month. x
An excellent programme- was ren
dered last night. Father Mulligan
spoke warmly of the cherished- desire of
his parish to build a- convent. The

VICTORS HA YE
CELEBRATION
PARK WINSLOW
The blue and gold is waving trium
phantly over the cardinal to-day, for
Btarford went down to defeat In the great
football battle for the infant champion
ship. There has never been another
freshman game to compare with the con
tent held on the gridiron at Berkeley yes
terday. Xone could pick a winner up to
the last minute of play. Bui. when the
referee sounded his whistle to announce
the struggle had ended. California had
Â»â¢ touchdown and a goal and the young
\u25a0ters from Palo Alto had no score.
Then the youths against whose backs
setting sun was shining, leaped over
guard rails In wild delight and car
ried on their shoulders the limp and
happy classmen whose brawn and brains
had gained the glorious victory. In
serpentine lines they marched amid deaf
ening cheers across the roughened check
erboard while the thousands in the grand
stands urged them on with voices grown
hoarse with shouting. On the : eastern
â¢side or the Held a little band of exhausted
boys with cardinal stockings watched
the gay scene dejectedly, while the friends
*ho had seen how well they fought tried
to remove a little of the bitterness of de
ft at.
MCUOWDS CO3IE EARLY.
Long before the appointed hour the
slope leading to the arena was gay with
color. E&ch irain sent forth its long
* tr ' a| n of humanity and from the high- <
waye ana 'tfte tjyTrayÂ£ the people of. Ber- '
ki ley augmented the torrent. On . the j
ww t *-t tide of the gridiron sat the Call- :
forma partisans. The bleachers opposite
were given over to those whose hopes
vcre centered in the prowess of Stan
ford. The wearers of the blue and gold
outnumbered the visiting rooters by more !
than two to one.
There could De no more enthusiasm at
the big varsity game. E\ery man in the
grandstand shouted himself into whisper- i
ing. Every lady waved somethingâ ban- !
ricr, handkerchief or parasolâ and jumped '
up and down in excitement. The weather j
vas ideal for sin-ctator, if a trifle warm |
for player. The bands played constantly j
when the cheering subsided. It was a
day of days and a game of games..
The best team won. There are- many
who will say otherwise. They will "say
that Stanford was the superior offensive
ly and the writer will agree with them. J
They will say that the cardinal excelled .
In punting a.nd again there will be no
dispute. They may claim that the boys
from down the bay shore were stronger
on the defense and there is where the
difference comes.
Taking line plays alone into considera
tion. Stanford had a belter defense than
California. Otherwise the visitors were
terribly inefficient. . Time and again
Stanford should have saved twenty yards
cr more when the home team ran in
punts. In this way the superiority of
the cardinal in kicking was nullified.
Offside playing detracts from the value
of any eleven. Stanford lost thirty yards
on penalizations. Careless handling of
the ball is a bad defect. Fumbles cost
the cardinal a possible chance to score
end dozens of yards on several occa
sions.
BKST TEAM WINS.
California had more speed and played
â¢with more spirit. With th<j ball only
a couple of feet from the goal line and j
c tie game. Stanford failed to send her '
men through for the score, but lost the '
ball. Layir.gr aside the questions of j
epeed, spirit, penalizations, fumbles and
the running in of punts, the cardinal
was superior. But these defect* made
the eleven from Palo Alto inferior as a
team.
X The ball was in Stanford's half of
the gridiron pretty much all of the
time. Occasionally the visitors would
show a burst of speed combined with
team work that made California look
like the proverbial SO cents, but the
fight was not continued. Some one
would funlble or go wrong on the sig
nals and the labor that had won an
advance over a dozen streaks of white
wash was lost. Both outfits were good
on team work. Both elevens were weak
offensively. Stanford held for downs
more frequently on line plays.
The cardinal had a kicker from Kick
ville. A punt of fifty yards was a cinch
for him at any time. All he needs is
a little practice to kick field goals from
the hundred-yard line or from back of
the fence. The backs In neither team
were strong in advancing: the ball. The
tackling- was high too frequently, to
be readily forgiven. Line plays proved
of little value to either team, except
when 'Stanford made an occasional
spurt. Attempts at end runs usually
resultfd in a loss for the side posses
sing the ball. The Interference on both
teams was really excellent and should
have brought better results.
California's quarter exercised better '
judgment than the man behind the
other center. '.There were no real fake '
plays. A nuarterback kick, however,
proved profitable to California in two
hard places and won the touchdown.
The condition of the men was about
on a rar. Grest credit is due both uni
versities that the play was absolutely
clean and manly. There were several '
delays exasperating 1 to the spectators
because of disputes and injuries... ;
* KXDS â¢ ABB WEAK.
The ends on both teams were weak.
They did not remember whose place It
\u25a0uas to down with the punts. Stan
ford has .-t triile the best of the argu
ment on tack!* 1!*,1 !*, and California was
Buperior in guards. About the only
piece where the blue and gold seemed

CALIFORNIA FRESEMEXMAKLYG A PLUNGE THROUGH THE CENTER ON STANFORD'S SIDE OF-: FIELD}
FIRST HALF COMES
TO END SCORELESS
Home Eleven Makes Brilliant Dash
From Center of Field to Touchdown.
California won the toss and took the
| field while the expectant thousands drew
! a long breath and waited for the battle
!to open. Down toward the goal posts
sailed the ball and Stanton nabbed it on
the five-yard line. He came back ten
I yards before the visitors smothered him
;in a heap of brandishing limbs. Call-
\u25a0 fornia bombarded the opposing line three
j times for the distance and then lost the
i pigskin on a fumble. Jackson got the
{ ball on the Blue and Gold twenty-five
j yard- line and the eastern bleachers were
a frenzied mass of wildly \yavlng colors.
Three, tackle plays netted seven yards,
then California strengthened and got the
ball on downs. Stanford's line was im
j pregnable and after two scrimmages, a
kick was ordered. The ball went forty
yards dov.n the Held, where the Stanford
backs fumbled it. When the eighty-eight
limbs were untangled, the referee called
it California's ball. The signal was given
for a try at a field goal and the crowd i
laughed in derision as the pigskin was
fifty-two yards from the posts.
The quarter fumbled the pass, but Stan
ton grabbed the ball and skipped away for
thirty yards around Stanford's right end.
Now the west side bleachers were swell
ing tumultuously with life. A buck at
the opposing left tackle gave the Blue
and Gold another ten yards. It looked
like a touchdown, but Stanford held.
Stanton tried for a fltld goal, but the
kick was blocked. A Stanford man got
the pigskin behind the posts and tried to
run out with It andwas downed. \u25a0\u25a0 .
CALLS IT A TOUCHBACK.
The referee called it a touchback, al
though the rumor swept hrough the audi
ence that the play was a safety. Stan
j ford kicked ten yards past center and
California brought the ] ball back to the
visitors' fifty-yard .line. Two line plays
| proved fruitless and the ball was punted
to Stanford's -, fifteen-yard line. Torney
kicked back to. center. California's kicker
punted' back ten yards high and outside.
It was Stanford's ball on her own forty
yard line. Torney kicked sixty yards.
California tried two bucks at tackle and
Stanton then sent the ball back' to center.
HoUnan muffed the fly and a Blue and
Gold urchin assimilated the pigskin. Stan
ford held and California kicked. The
Cardinal not to be outdone in courtesy
kicked back to center. California punted
again and Stanford also punted. The
Blue and Gold was making rapid progrtss'
toward Its own goal posts on this Inter
change of kicks. The half ended 'with. the 1
ball in Stanford's possession of Cainor-'
nla's forty-nve-yard line.
After Ahe intermission, the teams
changed \sid(S and California kicked toj
the five-yard line. Stanford tried for a.
punt, but a bad pass spoiled the play.'
By rare good luck, a Cardinal man fell
on the ball and saved his outfit .from'
being placed in a. very perilous position/
Torney kicked high and short. California'
got the ball on the Stanford fifteen-yard
line. Stanford was penalized for offside'
play and it looked like a sure score. "Xow
they will make a touchdown, the rascals,'*:
shouttd a famous Eastern college football
captain of other days who was sitting at
the writer's side. But the signal was for!
a try at a field goal and it missed. Here I
was an opportunity for California to have
pushed through for a score. rl
BALL. TRAVELS BACK.
Stanford v.-as safe for the moment and
while the roiters drew sighs of relief
the ball was sent back by the air route,
to center. California found a weak place
able to gain on a line play was through'
Stanford's 'left guard. Both cen
ters ' proved themselves; worthy of
their respective teams by t stopping hard
bucks. ' California, had a. better, quar
terback. The other backs were about
equal except In 'punting/ Torney, kicks
better than any man on either varsity
if yesterday's work is any criterion/?-;';,'
The pamÂ« n-as a big victory for
Coach Knlbbs. I>ist year Stanford had
j in Stanford's left side and made the dls
tance in two downs. Stanford was penal
ized for offside play and it was the Blue
and Gold on the Cardinal j thirty-yard
line. Bucking the middlemen netted fif
teen yards and. again a try was made at
| field goal. / .The same opportunity for
bucking the ball through for a touchdown
was presented, although two yards had
to be gained on "the -last down. The ball
j went wide as the spectators- had become
; accustomed to expect and Tormey lifted
j it back to the middle line.
j The visitors had repaired the holes in
I thtir armor and California was com
pelled to kick. The pigskin went low and
hard to the Cardinal ten-yard line. . Tor
ney booted the ball out of danger, but
Stanton captured it on the fiy. and made
a brilliant dash toward the Cardinal goal
for thirty long, glorious yards. Schaef
fer made a nifty little quarterback kick
unexpectedly. Holman touched, but
failed to grasp the ball. Stanton was
there, all hands, and drifted quietly be
hind the. goal posts where he dropped
with the ball clasped affectionately to his
heaving chest. It was California's touch
down. Cerf kicked the goal.
'CALIFORNIA EXULTS.
The great Blue and Gold monster on the
west side was rampant. The noise would
have drowned out the Ruef heelers at
the Republican ' convention In the Al- |
hambra. California was far in the lead. ;
There was just six minutes of play left.
Stanford kicked off and California kicked
back to center. Torney made ten yards
around his own right end. It took three
plays to-_ make the next five yards, then
Terril went around California's left end
for twenty yards. Here is where the
eastern bleachers began to see something
worth living for again.
Down the field slowly, but surely, went
the ball in Stanford's hands. Inexorably
the timekeepers tolled off the faithful sec
ands. I'Can they do it?" "Will they
have time?" was on every one's tongue.
"Don't let them do it, Freshmen,"
howled the west side..
"Get through there," "Give 'em the
ax,", yelled the east side. It was Stan
ford's, ball, three yards for the Blue and
Gold line.
"Call-for-r-rnia, Cali-for-r-rnia" shriek
ed' the dancing Berkeleyites.
"Eat 'em up," vociferated Stanford's
adherents.
"Oneâ twoâ threeâ fourâ fiveâ six," said
California.
The Cardinal freshmen gathered them
selves together for a rally, but like the
waves on the seal rocks they fell back.
One, twice and three times California's
sons held hard and stopped the furious
onslaught. Then it was all over. Cali
fornia took \ possession of the pigskin on
downs and kicked it far away out: into
the brown gridiron. The referee blew
his whistle after the first scrimmage,' and
It was California day. ,r, r

The football team from the" Lowell iliph
School yesterday proved L itself . worthy

of Mechanical Arts. The garqe was one
of those 0-0 affairs, which so much pro

was concerned neither team had the ad-
I vantage of .the other. â¢ ;
\u25a0 Shortly after 10. o'clock Giberson of
i Lowell kicked off to Hall, who ran the
i ball in fifteen yards before downed. Ilen

\u25a0 Rogers then lost, two yards and Hall losi
I fifteen more on:- a quarter-back sneak,
i Main punted to Roncovleri.who only ran
the ball in "five yards. : ' \u0084\.
Toward the end of the half- Lick gained

.a delayed pass.- for : end around end.
After using Henderson and Hotchkiss
again. Main, was forced to kick, 'the half
ending shortly after with the ball In Low

In the second half Main kicked off to
Giberson. Lowell did not retain the ball
long, however, as . they were .forced, .to
I kick. Lick,' in its turn, kicked also, the
ball going out of bounds. At this stage
of the game Lowell seemed to take a
sudden brace- arid gained thirty-four
yards on -one -buck and trick- plays, the
ball being in a fine position for a field
goal. On the next play TLscornia fumbled

The crowd ' poured over on the courss
to begin their departure, and after a
time Lancia started his car again ami
the crowd fell ba-.-k as the pistol-like
reports of the exhaust cracked and thvi
side.s of the machine belched tiamt: anÂ«r

The first ear was started promptly'
at tJ o'clock this morning, and the oth

report,^ anÂ»l a call for physicians was
made: but Kcene Mmself telephoned*
to the. stand that he was uninjured, but
would be unable to continue.the riice. r

j some apprehension was the report of Lyt

of woods on the back of the course. "VVV
K. Vanderbilt Jr. Jumped Into his racins

to pick up TattersalL It was found that
the latter had been fixing some of the"
car's * machinery and was leaning well
I forward *and at* a sharp turn -he was
hurled over and over out of. the car. He
was much scratched and bruised but no
bones were broken., - >
HEMERYCOMES TO THE FRONT. ;
These were the most serious of the day's;
accidents and gave the "crowds its thrills.;
Hemsry of the French team i. in tho
meantime had come well to' the front and?
from the seventh round oÂ» to the end
there was a pretty race between him and
-Heath. Going through- the starting point
on the ninth round Hemery - led Heath
ty two seconds. As the, pair passed the
grand stand a mighty shout went up.
They went through Lakevlllo fighting"
for the lead. *The fact that Kemery start
ed three minutes later than Heath seemed
, at his point barring accidents to make
the race surely his. Hemery passed Hyde
Park ahead of Heath. Now every one
leaned over the stands and strained his
i eyts down the road for the first glimpse
; of the winner.
Hemery was first to cross the line. The
\u25a0 occupants of, the stands held their breath'
\u25a0until the cars flew through. Scarcely a
chesr sounded juntil they, were well down
; the road. "Then the spectators shouted
themselves hoarse. \u25a0Â»
Dingley went through on his fifth lap
and Warden on his eighth. The fight for
the third place was between Tracy of the"
' Americans and Lancia. Tracy got third \u25a0
place.

Goldfielld Club Offers Nel
son and Lowell Boy Purse
of $25,000 for a Fight
KIO EAGAX CO3IES HERE
Is Deputized to Make Match,
Which, if Consummated, Is
to ]3e to Finish in Daytime
A purse of $25,000 nas been offered for
a finish fight betweer. Battling Nelson and
Jimmy Gardner. Kid Eagan, promoter
of the recent Hart-Root light at Reno
arrived in town yesterday and made the
offer in behalf of the Goldfleld Club of
Goldfitld.
Egan was deputise! here to secure the
match by Larry Sullivan and Pete Grant
of the Goldfield Club. Egan ofTers the
fighters a purse of $25,000, no percentage
being mentioned in his inducement. ; He
says if hs can get the signatures of both
men the conttst mus;t take place in the
open air on a day between Christmas and
New Years. Egan says that $5000 guar
antee is In the Nye & Ormsby Bank at
Goldfleld and on the signing of articles,
the club agrees to post JMJOO and the tight
ers will <be expected to pos: $2500 apiece
as evidence of good faith. The boxers
must be in Goldfleld ten days prior to
the contest and the referee to be se
lected one week before the battle.
Gardner has not been heard from as
yeU but it is most likely he will agree
to these conditions. He has claimed he
could make this weight and it is likely
Egan will havens consent at short no
tice. -\u0084--; 7 .--
Nelson is in the East on a theatrical
tour. Whether his contract with the dif
ferent theaters would allow him to come
West and battle is an obstacle that"
might prevent Egan from getting . the
Dane to light. JCelson and his manager
neve repeatedly stated that Gardner was
the next in line for a tight. The terms
for the match and th? liberal purse of
fered by Egan might lure the Dane to
ctase work befote the footlights and
turn westward for a, battle with the
Lowell boy.
Word from both fighters Is expected
by Egan within* a few days.

became a widow. Sick and but a few
days beiore a child was to bo born to
her, she was left a widow with meager
muds to provide the necessaries of life.
After tne child was born she strug
gled to support herself and baby. She
became sick a few weeks ago and had
been Starring until kind neighbors dis
covered her condition. Yesterday the
woman was removed to the Almshouse.

poorer players were larger than usual,

the new home. Lake street and Fourteenth ave
i.ue, on Thursday afternoon and evening, I Oc
tober 20.
The first fall meeting of the California
Polo and Pony Racing Association held
on the tiack at Charles W. Clark's beau
t'ful San Mateo country place yesterday
was extremely well patronized, more es
pecially by the exclusive set of Burlln
game and San Matco. Admittance was
obtained by invitation, it. being s.mply
racing for pure love of the thing. Auto
mobiles and styi.sh equipages of every
sort were lined up on the inner field and
fashionably gowned women greeted the
different winners from the members'
stand. For the accommodation of those
j speculatively Inclined a Paris mutuel box
was operated in the ring.
Although unsuccessful in the main fea
ture of the afternoon, it is interesting
to chronicle that on two occasions the
colors of Charles \V. Clark were seen
In tho fore. Five events were down for
decision, of which number favorites cap
tured three..
Tom Driscoll, the well-known polo play
er, presided in the judge's stand. Captain
John Barneson and C. T. Boots acted
as stewards. F. E. *~ulholland dispaich
cd the fields. Frank W., v-usack was offi
cial timer and Robert â¢f. Leighton ably
filled the position of clerk of the scales
and hamlieapper.
Much Interest developed over the meet
ing of Midlove, sporting the Clark colors
and ridden by Charles Dunphy car
rying 152 pounds, and Ulctma, the "Beat
tie flyer," now owned by Rudolph Spreck
els and having Frank Skinner up
with 148 pounds to shoulder. It was .a
pretty race to the stretch, where Mr.
Skinner, on the favorite, let .out "a link
and the Spreckels entry won llesurely
at the end in 52 seconds. Five Jollar mu
tuel tickets ?aid $735.
Mr. Dunphy took the opening quarter
mile scramble with Leah, which downed
Carlotta, the mount of J. O. Tobin,
with considerable in reserve. Chanate,
the Clark entry, piloted by the Australian
rider, Mr. Mackay, ran third. Mutuels
paid $22 50.
Mr. Dunphy followed j this by landing
the favorite, . Bas Blancs, first for^ the
three-furlong dash. The filly ran coupled
in the betting with her stable mate, Ethel
Qi Mr. Skinner rode an excellent race on |
Althomer, finishing a good second, but |
had no chance of beating the. winner. !
Mutuels paid fS 80. \u2666. . :

second quarter-mile spin. Leah, winner !
of the first number, repeattd her vie- j
tory by easily disposing of Alvernie from '
the Clark stable and Boastful.: Alvernie ,
was so strongly tipped that she . closed 1
favorite, but- was outsprinted fnnn.Btart j
to finish. Mutuels paid $13 50. ' V-. I
Mr. Marsh rode his second winner, of, the
day In the final slx-furlong run. The mare
eported the Clark silks, and after her sta
ble companion, Bas Blancs, had made
the early pace she took command, win
ning hands down from Carlolly. Tno last
named mare from the Spreckels string
lacked; early speed, but closed strong tin
der the vigorous | urging of Mr. Skinner/
taking the place from Bas Blancs by half

IÂ¥l l^i Cflfl'E C SAP THE VITALITY
WLII AND UNDERMINE
Old Sores that refuse to heal are a constant THE HEALTH
menace to health. They sap the vitality and undermine the constitution by
draining the system of its very life fluids, and those afflicted with one of
these ulcers grow despondent and almost desperate as one treatment after
another fails. They patiently apply salves, washes, plasters, etc., but in
spite of all these the sore refuses to heal and eats deeper into the surround-
ing flesh, destroying the tissues and growing: to be a festering, inflamed and
angry mass. The source of the trouble is in the blood. This vital "fluid is
filled with impurities and poisons which are constantly being discharged
into the sore or ulcer, making it impossible for the place to heal. It will not
do to depend on external applications for a cure, because they do not reach
the real cause, end valuable time is lost experimenting with such treatment;
the most they caa do is keep the ulcer clean. Any sore that will not heal is
dangerous, for the reason that it may have the deadly germs of Cancer behind
it. A cure can be brought about only through a remedy that can change the
quality of the blood, and this is what S. S. S. does. It goes to the very
bottom of the trouble, drives out the poisons and germs with which it is
S^â^ fi^ed. and purifies and builds up the entire cir-
gp^3 P?~^ eolation. By the use of S. S. S. the sore is
\|^k supplied with new, rich blood which corrects

WELCOME TO JOHN S. PARTRIDGE
Mass-Meeting in Thirty-Second
Hears Fusion's Nominee.
THIRTY-FOURTH FILLS THE HALL
Men Pack Stairway in Eagerness
to Listen to Candidates.
The fusion nominee for Mayor, John
g. Partridge, and his fellow candidates
on the Republican-Democratic ticket,
rlsited what is supposed to be one of the
t great Eatf strongholds last night in the
* Thirty-second District, w~ere they ad
dressed a large audience at Mangel's Hall.
From the reception accorded the speak
ers in the district, it is apparent that all
the shouting ie done by th<- Ruef-Schmitz
adherents, while the fusion voters* are
steadily working for the ticket.
Mangel's Hall was tilled with the rep
resentative classes of the district and
on only one occasion was there a cry for
tlie opponent of -~r. Partridge. This cheer
was so weak that one of the speakers
urged the few noi6y ones to try again and
do better.
The first speaker introduced by P. J.
Hagrgerty, the presiding officer, was Pe
ter J. Curtis, the present Sheriff and fu
sion candidate for re-election. Curtis
made a straightforward appeal to the vot
ers for an indorsement of his acts as
Sheriff and was heartily applauded. He
said that he feared " no man and assured
his hearers that he would uphold the law
and preserve order In the community
while acting as Sheriff. He closed with
an appeal to the voters on behalf of
Samuel Braunhart, the Supervisor, who
Is now on a sickbed and unable to make
his campaign.
i:m:mii:s spread lies.
General C. A. Woodruff followed Ed
:nond Godchaux. candidate for re-election
as Recorder, and appealed in his speech
:o the mothers and fathers of the city.
He described the wide open conditions of
Chicago and compared them with the
pres+nt conditions in San Francisco. He
~sosed with a description of the develop
ment of SSan Francisco by natural causes,
4J> ne of which could be attributable to
.Mayor Schmitz and fully answered the
rry that Schmitz was responsible for the
cuy's growth.
The speaker was interrupted by ue en
trance of Mr. Partridge, who â¢was warmly
cheered and who was then presented as
the next speaker. Mr. Partridge said in
part:
â¢'Already my enemies are spreading vile
scandals about me and seeking to lie
aboi" me to the people. They supposedly
quote an article of mine In the case of
Hess vs. the Typothetae, and by garbling
the writing and leaving out portions of
the context seek to paint me the enemy
o- labor.
"I^ast Tuesday night I warned the
Kiafters to do their worst. I wanted to
bo fair in this whole campaign, and so I
-mcd them to do all thoy could to de
feat me. They have taken the warning.
and by their actions we know who they
are. They are driven out into the open,
un'j|'rom now on it will be give and take
<>nW>oth sides. They are* uttering lies
about me on the stump; they are pre
paring scurrilous printed matter for cir
culation; their hired thugs are tearing
down my banners and assaulting the men
who put them up. The campaign commit
tee is sending out banners bearing, the
words, 'Against the Grafters.' No man
can object to those words, unless he Is a
grafter. I know there are thousands of
honest men who are supporting my oppo
nent, and they can have no objection to
those words. But the men who are sup
porting my opponent because they want
V) graft are the ones I mean. And again
defy them to do their worst.
SAX FRAXCISCO'S REPUTATION.
"Many of you here are my friends, and
I want you to take this message and pro
claim it wherever you go: That if the
fusion ticket is defeated, the world will
believe, rightly or wrongly, that more
than half the people of San Francisco
are in favor of corrupt government.
"In connection with the Spring Valley
Water Works case, I have met a num
ber of eminent engineers from Eastern
cities, and, like every one who visits us,
I have found them enthusiastic in their
praises of San Francisco and her future
prospects. Without exception they have
Informed me that al lthrough the Bast
men are looking to this city as a profit
able field for the establishment of large
enterprises. 'But,' they say, 'you have a
very bad reputation. Your city govern
ment is considered so corrupt that men
who intend to Invest here are waiting for
& change.'
"Aside from every other consideration
that fact is doing incalculable harm to
every man in San Francisco, no matter
how he earns his living. ' It is doing harm
to the property holder, because .if new
capital Is invested here it means an in
crease in real estate values. It means
harm to the wage earners, above all, be
cause increased capital means plenty of
employment and high wages. How can
er.y man who works for his living be in
favor of an administration which drives
business away from the town?
want to say to you, as I said last
"f^nt in the Twenty-ninth District, that
any man who says that I am under the
domination or control of any body of
men hostile to labor lies in his throat,
and I defy him to produce the proof."
As Mr. Partridge left the hall Henry U.
Brandenstein. the fusion candidate for
District Attorney, entered and was warm-

ly cheered. Brandenstein gave them some
inside facts regarding the relations be
tween the Mayor and the Board of Su
pervisors, and told several stories well
known at the City Hall regarding the
graft practiced in the municipal build
ing. He closed with an answer to the at
tacks made upon him personally by the
gangsters.
AT DUVEXECK'S HALL.
"Voters of the Thirty-fourth, I have
lived among you since boyhood and stud
ied your needs almost twenty years. 1
know what you need in this district and
when I am Mayor I will see that you get
equal privileges the same as any other
part of the city." These were the words
spoken by John S. Partridge last night
at Duveneck's Hall at Twenty-fourth and
Church streets before an audience that
filled the place to overflowing.
From the time of Partridge's entrance
until the close of the meeting he was re
peatedly applauded and cheered and the
reception accorded the candidate and his
associates on the fusion ticket has
spurred on the Republican and Demo
cratic workers of the district to renewed
but friendly rivalry for the success of
the nominees. The remainder of Mr.
Partridge's speech follows:
"Not only have I studied the needs of
the voters of the Mission, but those of
the entire city. I am strongly and heart
ily in favor of a better water supply than
that which now exists, and I will do all
in my power to secure it. "When it was
proposed to bring the Sierra streams to
our city we made a visit to the mountains
and attempted to purchase the water
shed. We there found that other inter
ests in this city were working against us
and appeals have been made to Wash
ington. I promise you to do all in my
power to obtain the supply.
GRAFTERS 3IUST GO.
"I have given the grafters fair warn
ing that I will throw every one of them
from the City Hall when I am elected,
and they have all turned out against me.
I am glad to see it. for,, although I did
not to seek this nomination and did not
want it. 1 am determined not to let them
whip me and they will know that they
have been in a fight. Not by tearing
down my banners will the gangsters be
able to defeat the fusion ticket. This is
not going to be a fight on points, but will
go on until the count of ten is made and
the gong rings the defeat of one or the
other of us. I do not fear any attacks
made upon me and will answer any at
tacks. lam not afraid of anything they
may attempt, from viU abuse to physical
violence. \ \\. \'',
"This present administration has had
the advantage of $1,770,000 from the
sale of bonds and still the streets are
unpaved and unsÂ«wered and the
schoolhouses are yet to be built.
"Why, over in this section of the 2ity
there is a school to be erected for $119,
000. City Engineer Grunsky estimated
the cost at $108,000, with contingeaies
amounting in full to $119,000. and yet
the school is yet to be started. I -rill
build the Geary-street road, not t ilk
about it, and will see that the sewers
are constructed. Are laboring men
going to vote for a man who holds bi ck
the development of the city? I say co."
While the audience was awaiting the
arrival of Partridge, Henry U. Bran
denstein addressed it on the falsity of
the opposition, claiming that the issue
of the campaign was the Citizens' AKi
ance. He also told of the hiring aid
firing of the employes of the Board of
Health by those in power, according to
a list furnished in the Mayor's offl :e
by Buet.
where: steals are made.
P. J. Healey, who presided at tie
meeting, also introduced Dr: d'Ancon t,
candidate for re-election as Superviso/.
Dr. d'Ancona told of the friction be
tween the present Board of Supervisoa s
and the Mayor and spoke of the trich -
cry of the gangsters throughout the de
partments of the City Hall. â¢
Nominee for Supervisor, John A. Me â¢
Gee, who is making a strong campaign,
reviewed the stand of the Police Com
missloners during the great teamsters
strike In ordering police on the wa
gons, and said that one man stood out
against putting them there, Commis
sioner Dave Mahoney. The first thing
Schmitz did was to remove Mahoney
and appoint, instead, Drinkhouse, the
man discredited by the cigarmakers.
Hutton, who was placed on the board
by the City Front Federation, was re
moved by the Mayor to makÂ«. place for
Ruef's personal friend. Dr. Poheim.
H. G. Davis, a leading: Democrat of
the district, told of the graft of the ad
ministration in the civil service, in the
Yorke & CoYs bill for three times the
amount of work really done, in the
High School textbooks, in the shaving:
of police and firemen's warrants and in
the hold-up of salo,onmen whose
licenses are threatened. â¢
The other speakers were Fred Egr
gers, Edmond Godchaux, John' Connor
and Joseph A. Nyland.
SECURING EVIDENCE
AGAINST BEEF: TRUST
Government Prosecutors Is
sue Subpenaes for For-
Packers.
CHICAGO, Oct. 14.â Important sub
penas for former officials of packing
companies said to have been consolidated
into the National Packing Company and
for former officials of the latter company
were issued to-day by the Federal offi
cials. An attempt is being made to show
in the trial of the packers. that the men
eubpened signed contracts or. knew of
such papers, binding the owners of the
consolidated companies to an agreement
that the signers would "not engage in the
tame line of business after the sale.
The Government apparently will try to
show that the new packing company is
practically a clearing-house and that by
its organization trade commerce and com
petition was thw -cd. .
The list Includes the following: . George
H. Taylor, treasurer of the Continental
Packing Company; Thomas E. Wells,
former president, of the Continental Pack
ing Company; Benjamin S. Wilson, for

Schmitz hoodlums tore down the fusion
banners.
Vandals of the Ruef camp are resorting'
to this kind of lawlessness : in every dis
trict of the city. The police pay no at
tention to these acts of vandalism. The
law-abiding citizens of San Francisco are
becoming so accustomed to exhibitions
of lawlessness that they would not be
astonished at the spectacle of the Chief,
of Police himself leading a band of row
dies in a raid against the nominees of
the fusion ticket.
Grafters chortled in their Joy when they
saw a paragraph in a morning paper yes
terday that only five merchants of the
city responded to Louis Sloss 1 Invitation
for a conference, on finance at fusion
headquarters.' The hilarity was prema
ture. The response to Mr. Sloss' circular
letter was prompt and gratifying. . There
will be no lack of means to meet the
expenses, of the Partridge campaign. ';
Before Mr. Partridge accepted the
nomination for Mayor he frankly said to
the members of the organization commit
tee of the San Francisco Republican
League that he had no money to conduct
the campaign. The committee then told
him that the citizens of San Francisco
would contribute the money. When David
Rich suggested to his fellow members, of
the executive committee that Mr. Part
ridge Bhould be chosen as the nominee
for Mayor it was quite well understood
that the latter had no 'money to make
the fight. Republicans and Democrats,
who have gone Into the battle to drive
the grafters from power, will see to it
that a sufficient sum of money Is raised
to effectively organize the forces of
fusion In every Assembly district of the
city. Louis Sloss, as chairman of the
finance committee, will see that the mon
ey Is properly applied. Merchants, bus
iness men, professional men and wage
earners have confidence in his' integrity
and Judgment. There will -be- no black
listing of men who do not contribute to
the fund and there will be no "hold ups"
or forced assessments.
If Mr. Herrln wants to contribute to
the fund on his own personal behalf or
as the representative of the Soumern Pa
cific Railroad, it. 'is presumed that the
committee would cheerfully accept the
donation.
There Is a deep and indisposed feeling
throughout the city that a change in the
administration of municipal affairs would
promote peace, prosperity' and decency.
The fusion campaign committee' Is as
sured that many men prominent in labor
unions entertain the opinion that organ
ized labor cannot stand for Ruef. ';
To-day the fusion j nominees for office .
take a well-earned rest In preparation for
the arduous programme of campaigning
mapped out by the campaign committee.
To-morrow night Mr. Partridge will speak
at Phelps Hall and Twin Peaks Hall.
The other speakers will be: H. U.
Brandenstein, Charles A. Swelgert, H. G.
Davis, Daniel A. Ryan, H. B. Leland,
John Connor, A. J. Fritz 'and Jesse W.

speak at Harmony -*all, Mission Opera

The official view, here is that the

CHEERS GREET MAYOR SCHMITZ'
SPEECH TO WAGE-EARNERS.
Crowd in Electricians' Hall Approves the* Sentiments Ex
pressed by San Francisco's Chief Executive. ,
"I would rather be defeated In my can
didacy for Mayor than to have it said
of me that I was in office with the collar
of a corporation around my neck." Thus
declared Mayor Schmitz at a meeting
held at Electricians' Hall, 35 Eddy street,
last night. The room was packed to over
flowing and the Mayor . took the oppor
tunity to carefully go " over what he
termed the general results of his admin
istration. '
Municipal ownership of public utilities
was the Mayor's theme at each of the
two meetings which he addressed last
night. He urged " in no mincing terms
that the voters of this municipality elect
the Union Labor party -ticket from top
to bottom, so that he would -have some
power behind him to help push what he
promised would be a real reform. He
pledged, himself to see that the new
schoolhouses were built and that the
rates on gas and water were reduced.
He claimed that the 50,000 men . who
marched In the parade on Labor day
were his supporters and that on Novem-

that' he was a union man himself. "There
never: was a- man who stood up ; for* the
labor organizations." he said, ''who has
not been vilified 1 by some of the capital-;
istic members of the community. I have
been held up to. scorn; yet I- am the
stronger for It. For four years I have
faced serious problems and during all

HARRIMAN LINES
TO BE IMPROVED
Julius Kruttschnitt arrived â¢ from
Chicago last night and is at the Palace
Hotel. He came to meet President Har
rlman of the Southern Pacific, who is
due" here from the Orient on October 23
on the steamship Siberia.
Kruttschnitt announced last night
that the Harriman lines are all to be
improved in every, way. He said he had
recently placed large orders for rails
and for rolling stoqk. In this list is
included 100,000 tons of ninety-pound
rails. Orders have been placed also
for 140 locomotives, 6000 freight cars,
120 passenger coaches and 72 diner 3.
All of these are to be of the most im
proved style. .
For the coast trade betweeen New
York and New Orleans and New York
and Galveston the company has ordered
two 10.000.-ton steamers, and for the
line running: between New Orleans and
Savannah : a 10,000-ton steamer with
turbine engines is being built. Nine
teen steamers are* already in operation,
on the Atlantic Coast.
In reference to improvements on the
lines on this coast, Kruttschnitt said
that the block signal system" was be
ing, put in as rapidly as possible. The
system Is now complete between here
and Sacramento, and within two years
it will be complete, between here and
Omaha, he said.
The narrow gauge line, he said, would
ultimately be turned ,into a broad gauge
line. " . \u25a0-\u25a0â¢"".
When asked about the Carquinez bridge.
Krutsehnitt replied that he had positive
ly nothing â¢to say. , He would * not deny. â¢
however, that that question would come
up for discussion. when Harrlman arrived
here. | That it will be largely discussed
there , can be no question.
Within the last ten days officials high in
the Southern Pacific have been in Mar
tinez investigating the tide land on the
water front near that point. Last week a
gang of surveyors of the Southern Pacific
was In ' Benicla and it \u25a0Is reported 'â¢ that
It made two surveys for a . bridge to be
constructed : from points that would be
1 most advantageous for the railroad com
pany, v
The survey , starts at; Array Point and
ends at- a' place below Grangers wharf.
The \u25a0 second â¢ runs from the hills back of
Benicla, through the burial grounds of
the Catholic fathers, .near the Govern
ment; arsenal,- to a point in the hills Just
below the Nevada docks. If this latter
survey should be decided upon, .lt will
mean the cutting : out of Benicla and
Port Costa, because the grade on the
Benicia side of the bridge will not strike
the main track until Crockett is reached,
which ' is about two and a half miles
from tha Nevada docks.
The bridge, whenever it Is built, will
have to be. a pier structure, at least
sixty feet above the surface at high wa
ter, according to the statement given out
by Secretary of -War. Taft.
Danish Ladles , Entertain.
/â¢The Danish Ladies* Relief Society
gave an entertainment and dance at
Saratoga Hall last night. The pro
gramme given by a mixture of ama
teurs and professionals was a creditable
one/: The music was furnished "by
Lamp's Orchestra.- The proceeds ' will
be turned Into the treasury "of/ the
Danish Ladles'; Relief Society.- Judging
from the crowd that attended the sum
wil 1 : be\ a substantial one.
POLICE HUNT;! FOR I SHOPLIFTER.â

WONDERFUL TESTIMONY" of Mr. C. En-
gleke of the Cal. DEMOKRAT, late owner

years universally known and respected In
6. F. : -MY RHEUMATISM, which off and
on I had 20 years, at times BEDRIDDEN tor
days and WEEKS was completely CURED
â¢ 4 days ago and still STAYS cured. Last
week I SAW and now positively VOUCH for
the following: MY DAUGHTER'S large
GOITRE nearly all disappeared by ONE
treatment. Mr. Ellwood (1114 Howard) had
LOCOMOTOR ATAXIA. which preventefl
RAISING foot or leg, arm DEAD and IM-
MOVABLE, by ONE treatment MOVED arm.
RAISED leg to table top and LEAPED
often. NOTED CITX PHYSICIANS deaf
ear heard distant WHISPERING by one
treatment. Another DEAF . ear heard
WHISPER at 20 feet after I had touched it
ONE MOMENT with a handkerchief which
Rexradlo had CHARGED with his h'd
RADIUM power, though he never personally
came into contact with the patient, who
stood 20 feet from him. PROMINENT PRO-
FESSIONAL man badly PARALYZED, could
not RISE from a chair without two persons
LIFTING him up. also could not raise foot
from floor, instantly ROSE from chair UN-
AIDED and LIFTED foot from floor. DEAF
MUTE instantly HEARD and SPOKE many
words that were WHISPERED to her (one
treatment). PARALYTICS LEGS, very
feeble. Instantly LEAPED over a CHAIR
laid on its side on floor. Practically
D-U-M-B man instantly SPOKE intelligibly.
The written ana signed TESTIMONY of all
these grateful patients was also signed by
the following EYE-WITNESSES and I will

SIBERIA IS MAKING A RECORD RUN HOME
Pacific Mail Liner, With Har
liman on.'Board, Will Eace
â¢ --From Yokohama.
Bunkers Are Filled With
Picked Coal and She Car
ries Additional Stokers.
The liner Siberia, with Miss Alice
Roosevelt and the Harriman party on
board, which left Yokohama on Fri
day, is expected to make a record run
across tho I-sxclllc. Under ordinary
circumstances she wouM make the run
In about eleven days. With" President
Hal xiiiian on board, however, an effort
is likely to be made to break all pre
vious records.
The Siberia left here prepared to do
some speedy steaming, and she did It
on the outward voyage. She is carry
ing: liftcen additional coal passers, and
at the Pacific Mail wharf they look
for the liner at any time after noon
of next Sunday. . .â¢' .
In actual time from, port to port the
trans-Pacific record is held by the Em
press of Jnpan. The Korea on her last
trip traveled .faster than the Empress,
out having nearly a day's journey far
ther to go yv.Ts a few hours behind the
Canadian Pacitic liner's time. The Brit
ish line still <-liiinis the right to carry
the broom. :~^C -
The^Siberia. it is believed, can over
come the handicap or" extra distance
and still beat the Empress* time, and
conditions never will be more favorable
for making the effort. It is understood
that before leaving the other side the
Siberia's bct&ers were filled with bet
ter coal thnn is usually bought for the
homeward trip and a greater quantity
of it. With pic-Ked coal, fifteen addi
tional roul passers and the inspiration
of President Harriman's presence on
board. ?f the Siberia does not come into
port with a new broom lashed to the
masthead it will be because she has
not "got it in her.*'

A trad, journal cays: "Since the cuspen
*:oa of the lake axd rail buelneÂ«a trora Paclflo
Coast points, the withdrawal of. thÂ© rates be
cornlr.c e^tcuve on the 30th of last month,
fh'.ngie prices have fallen off about sc; thÂ«
market is now quoted steady. Several ehlngle
reacts have closed down and the movement
-r-a-usrurated by thÂ« Shlngl* Manufacturers' Bu
reau for a. general winter cloee-fiown of two
mot:tiiÂ« ie erowlcg rapidly. The ehlngle manu
facturers who are In the combination to close
<-ows their plant* for a stated period during
-.he winter aeaaon feel that the Blackening of
the market will prove beneficial to their pro
ject, inasmuch as there will not be the tame
Inducements to oontlnne manufacturing as
were oSered before the market began to de
cline."
The Vanderllp Speech Acnln.
The New York wires of E. F. Hurton & Co.
yestÂ«reay Â«alfi:
- â¢'Sellers of ctocke on the VarjSerlip speech
rave beea astonished at the underlying strength
of the market. They Â«iw the contracts pass to
strong hands, some of whom are affiliated with
thÂ« Interests whose viewe Mr. Vanderllp is
euppesed to reflect. . They realize that, boiled
down, this gentleman's utterance* were far
more favorable to the bull than to the bear.
There Is a positive feeling that the 6hort com
mitments made on the Idea that the Standard
Oil capitalists are working for a decline will
be covered on an adrar.ee. Despite tfc'.a week's
i reaction In prices, the technical poeition of the
Â£1 -tock market Is explained by the continued
"* absorption o f stocks by (substantial Interests.
Contrasting prevailing trade conditions with
those of a little more than a year ago, a good
authority eeys that then the problem of the
teianagement was how to keep prices from
paing down. To-day Its Ingenuity Is being
taxed to keej> them/ from going up to avert a
ruaaway market." '
Ralsinsi and Dried Fruits.
Mail advices from Xew York say:
"Buyers" hesitation to confirm orders for
r.ew crop California seeded Raisins has been
increased by *he development of Important out
eiae competition. The California Fruit Can
r.^rs 1 Association, which has entered the IMed
Fruit fitld, is making & bid for a share of the
Raiein business by putting out prices that on
***de<i goods are half a cent a pound lower
thin those Issued by the Raisin Growers' Com
pany en Thursday last, or 7Â» 4 c for fancy and
T^sc for choice seeded la one-pound cartons
t. o. b. crtast. This competitor of the combine,
b*?ing 'a a more independent position than the
â¢rnaJler fry by reason of Its large Interests
In other direet-ons, *nd being errdemly pre
pared to mate sacrifice cf profits to get a
ggOPC foothold in this, for It. new field. Is
expected to make a. stiff fight to gain ita
point. It is understood here that the Cali
fo:r.ia Fruit Canners' Association Is well
quipped in the matter of packing and seeding
raeihties and that there is a sufficiently large
tereage in Raisins not under contract 'to the
combine or rackere affiliated with it to assure
an ample eupply of Raisins for seeding pur
poses. Moreover, the threat of injunction pro
ceedlrgs, whirh has been Â«ffecUve with smaller
â¢â¢eders, will. H is believed, be without <*e
terrem influence upen this more formidable
competitor of the claimant of exclusive patent
rights in ell seeding devices. Email outside
eeeders of California RÂ»is!r.s are offering r.ew
crop fancy seeded at "ijc f. o. b. without ap
parently attracting much attention from buy
ers here. Imported Raisins, especially Smyrna
euÂ»tar.as. are in active demand and the busi
ness so far done in the new crop is .said to
h.a\-e beÂ«n larger than Jn many years past.
, foine trade authorities estimate the quantity
BOJ4 for distribution in the United Staue from
the beginning of the season to- date at fully
â¬5.000 boxes. Currants remain firm in the pri
mary market and fire steady but rather quiet
fcere. Prunes were steady, but with appar
ently little Inquiry for prompt or future de
liveries. Peaches and Apricots were somewhat
eperisgly cStered and w*re held on the pre
vious high le\el of prices."

THE COPPER STOCKS.
BOSTON, Oct. 14. â Activity in coppers con
tinued roMlay. but traders took advantage of
the higher prices and sold stocks all around
the room. Boston Consolidated continued to
! be well bought, the orders coming principally
from New York. The attention of traders is
I being gradually turned from the cheaper stocks
to the medium-priced Issues, and Osceola, Mo
hawk and Copper Range are meeting with at
tention at these prices. Money is still tight,
with very little prospects of lower rates for
I some time to come.

A'ew York Cotton .Market.
NEW YORK. Oct. 14. â The market was
pounded after the opening, with January sell
ing down to 9.77 c. The rally which followed
carried the list up about a dozen points, with
the close a point or two better than last
night's-. Sentiment was tomewhat mixed,. but
more, bearish in the long run. There was some
heavy selling by a prominent house who have
been sellers for the last* few days on their
estimate of the crop. 1 There is no definite
frost news as to damage done, but it will
take a little time for results to be seen. With
temperatures abnormally low it will undoubt
ediy put an end to a top crop, as cotton is
never known.. to thrive under these conditions.
While the spot demand is lair it will no doubt
show a ereat increase if the South .offers cot
ton on the price of futures, but es long as
the deadlock between spinners and the pro
ducers continues operators rather look for the
market to hang around these prices.

well supplied and indifferent about- buying.

poor- condition. The market was abundantly
supplied with Cranberries an<} 'Wade was're

poor stock, which met with slow sale. ..Melons

while off lots were neglected and easy. A
feature of the Citrus market was .the arrival
of two boxes of -new crop , Grape Fruit from

Have Been Lost During tlie
Storm Last' Wednesday
.\u25a0 ; \u2666â
NEW YORK, Oct. 14.â Five lives are
! known to have been lost and more than
thirty persons injured, one of them
fatally, on the Cunard line steamer
Campania . last. Wednesday when a glr
gantic^wave rolled over the vessel and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SUNDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1905.
.swept across a deck thick with steer-!
age passengers. I
So sudden was the coming of the
disaster . and so great the confusion
which attended and, followed it that
even the officers ; of the steamer them
selves were unable to-day upon the
vessel's arrival here to* estimate the
full extent of the tragedy.:^ It is pos
sible that the five persons known to be
missing from the "steerage may not
constitute the full number of dead.*
When the Campania reached quaran
tine to-day ten of the injured pas
sengers were still in the ship's hospital,
some of the seriously hurt, and a score
of others were nursing minor injuries.
John Graham of Milwaukee was 6no |
of the passengers, washed overboard]
and lost. The others who are known
to have lost their lives; were two Irish I
girls and two other women.

I disaster when" suddenly the big steamer
lurched to porUand,<scooped- up,' an
enormous sea. "The steamer's side was
buried and passengers on; the deck,
above tUe. steerage, were: submerged 'to
their waists; as; the immense volume, of
water rolled aft- and then: surged for
ward. All the cabin passengers on the
; upper " deck succeeded 'in:' clinging 'to
supports, while the waters surged
around them and were saved, but-' the
unfortunates in. the steerage _l deck
found themselves utterly helpless.- So
great was the volume and force of tl\e
rushing waters that a door in the rail
was smashed and through this opening
five of the helpless ones who had been
caught by the wave were swept to their
death. Others dashed againat the rails
and like obstructions, and escaped;
death, but many of; them received |
severe injuries. t " "I/-'-.
CHILDREN AXE SAVED.
From.tho steerage passengers it was
learned that thÂ«:lives of several chil
dren were saved by a stewardess. Miss
