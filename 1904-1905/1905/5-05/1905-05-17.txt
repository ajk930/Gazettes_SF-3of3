Strike.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Byington refusefi to answer thequestion
directly.. The District Attorney's confi
dent that Smith has cached somewhere a
large portion of his stealings. '
Both the District ' Attorney and Barrett
quoted decisions In support of their argu
ments. Finally ' Judge I Lawlor called ' a
halt to the wrangling and declared that
he -would raise the bail, to 140,000 to cover
the peculations with 'which the :' thieving
Tax Collector has already been charged.
Barrett then hurried fr.om the courtroom.
The Plnkerton detective* who have
been '.trying 1 to locate where. Smith.: has
"planted" his loot- hare at last located
a part of, H In Lna Angeles:. The lo
rn 1 representatives : refuse .to tell how
â¢Are you stating ihat Smith has in his
possession property which he has stolen?"
demanded Barrett- \u25a0: .>;-=\u25a0,- -
If the accused has property obtained
by commission of the crime he should be
held for an amount at least as large as
that which he obtained by commission of
the crime." Byington rejoined
W hen Barrett announced to Judge
Lairlor that he had securities for $20 IS
E>ington made the motion that the bond
be raised to $70,000.
Barrett objected strenuously to thiiT'
"His bail has be*n fixed at ttO.000?" Â£Â£
Earrett.^ "We have here bonds for that
amount from the Guaranty Title and
Trust Company."
â¢Why Smith must have somewhere an
amount in excess of. that sum in his
possession and the bail is decidedly too
easy." the District Attorney declared
The appearance of John . J. Barrett as
attorney for Smith -surprised both Foret
man Andrews and District Attorney
Byington. Barrett refuses to say whit
S^^Y ll^ f Â° r Smlth ' Yd reuses
to be interviewed upon the case
When Bylngton heard that Smith was
ab^V,Â° be relea Â«* on Â«0.Â«o he 7"
mediately prepared to fight for a larger
bond. He declared that to release the
defaulter on such bail would d^ out!
Smith will not be photographed by the
police photographer, that is final " de
clared Chief Dinan yesterday
The defaulter was given a cell to him
self, but he spent little time behind the
Efâ¢" * J*' aS conveni ently necessary for
him to be present in the office of the
Captain of Detectives nearly all day un
til he was released.
By yesterday afternoon Attorney Bar
rett was ready with the bonds for $20 GOO
under -which Smith was at first held;
But Foreman Andrews of the Grand Jury
end District Attorney Byingtoa were de
termined that he should not be released
on such a email amount. Judge Lawlor
decided that as Smith had been indicted
for stealing nearly $40,000 the ball should
at least be as large as the peculation*
charged to the defaulter.
When Barrett realized that Smith
cculd not be released on $20,000 bonds he
curried from the courtroom. Before 9
o'clock he and James B. Smith had ar
ranged to raise the full $40,000 the
amount Judge Lawlor decided upon.
The man who robbed the city, betrayed
his friends axid disgraced his family was
treated with extraordinary consideration
by the police yesterday. Chief Dinan
departed from the custom of photograph-
Ing felons in the case of Smith. Where
the unfortunate wretch who steals a loaf
of bread would be hustled around and
cragged before the camera of the police
photographer. Smith was spared.
sHowar 3iAjvv favors.
The door was quickly slammed. The
husband was left to talk to the woman
who was ready to forgive the grossest
wrong that could be offered to her. She
held her husband in her arms as the
door closed upon them. And she uttered
no reproaches.

As soon as lie was released Smith was
hurriedly placed In a. hack with his
brother. James B. Smith, and Barrett.
The vehicle was driven rapidly away
from ti.e Hall of Justice.
Smith went to face the one he had
wronged most of all â his wife. He was
driven rapidly out to his home -at 339
Pair Oaks street.
When the carriage stopped in front
of tfae bouse the two. Smiths and Bar
rett hurried up the stairway.' As the
former Tax Collector stood on the
threshold oÂ£ his own home J_he, criminal
faltered &n instant.

The door was flung open. Smith raised

NO HARM DONE
SAN JOSE, May 16.â rEd ward Corr, a
farmer of Warm Springs. Alameda
County, dropped dead on West- Santa
Clara street thi3 morning. " ; It is said
that Corr had come here to be married
to a Mrs; ' Jone- of San Francisco. Two
weeks ago 'he: obtained a license In- San
Francisco} to wed the Mrs. , JoneSi . but
for some' reason .the wedding was post
poned. v ""An ; inquest "to-night showed
that death ; resulted from a rupture of
a blood vessel in his brain.
Another division of; reinforcements for
Rojestvensky; is. almost ready .'at'Kron
stadt. and t will be â¢ sent out under,; the
command of Rear Admiral Parenagb. ; It
will consist . of ; two fine " new battleships;
the Slava and the Emperor. Alexander. ll;
two . cruisers, . a torpedo ; a giih
boat, a transport and several minor "units.
The division is now engaged In speed
trials and maneuvering off ; Kronstadt.~
The appearance" of Xthis reserve I division
in the Far East in;the course of .the sum
mer,- shoul4-the hostile fleets suffer equal--'
ly in. the coming battle,; is- counted"; upon
to ."givey Russia the pneoes'sary,; decisive
preponderance, on the: sea:; The posses-;
Eion of L this division,/ naval- men believej
may eventually prove Russia's salvation.
Many naval men incline to the opinion
that Rojestvensky \u25a0 will pass . out .- of the
China Sea into the Pacific -\u25a0 through the
Ballingtang channel, north of the island
of Luzon, Philippine* Islands, and give
Formosa a wide berth, instead of "sailing
through the 200^mile stretch of the Straits
of Formosa, in ' which â¢ the Russians might
be subject to a torpedo attack. ;> ;\u25a0
The many wild reports emanating from
Tokio are attributed to the agitated state
of mind of the Japanese over the coming
battle. The story that sailors from the
crews of the interned Russian ships at
Shanghai are being sent to" complete the
complement of Rojestvensky's !\u25a0\u25a0 fleets is
nonsense, as is the previous story that a
large number of mercenaries were shipped
at Madagascar. * ; \u0084*::..
The admiralty considers --' there .is \u25a0no
harm now in divulging the fact that Ro-
Jestvensky's ships are overmanned, in
stead of undermanned. . .When they left
Llbau there was still hope that" Chilean
and Argentina warships could be pur
chased and portions of > the crews de
signed for them were carried .on board
the Russian fleet. : ,
ST. PETERSBURG, May 16.â The naval
game in the Far East is watched, with
Intense interest here, but the Admiralty

not guilty will be made. Attorney Bar

be, and Smith's brothers are equally reti

SHANGHAI, May- 16.â The rumored

Ludwig Nlssen of New York spoke on
the Governmental relations of public fran
chises. The address was \ largely J devoted
to a; discussion; of the '; "lin-Amerlcanism
of Government <& public utili
ties." He said in part: '\u25a0' VÂ«-:l '-
Reciprocity^ would be a wiser course \ than
tariff revision. .1 .do not think the eltuatton
calls for radical treatment, but rather for the
adoption of .a conservative policy looking more
to ,the to the bottling up of
our commerce. ,\u25a0..;',- . ' , , ;
â¢ To my; mind: there are some features In the
present tariff situation that open to serious
question the wisdom of the "stand pat", policy.
Th 6 foreign'-- demand: for,' our 'agricultural, pro
ducts appears ' to be declining', and "\u25a0 the expor
tation \u25a0 \u25a0 of , manufactured commodities -Is : . not
nearly so great as - it " ehould be. How in the
face of unfavorable :.; f orelen ' tariffs 'we - can
materially develop the market abroad is l dif
ficult ,to see, unless - through the adoption of
a l more \u25a0 liberal .; tariff policy on \u25a0 our own â¢ part
we I secure ' compensating . c<Â»neesÂ«lonft \u25a0 \u25a0 In > th.?
tariff schedule of those countries whose .mar
kets we. seek.
While, the 'enlargement of the scope and
power jf of \ government .by the ' purchase and
management lof I certal n enterprises has found
considerable support - among the \u25a0 people, ! yet I
believe the sentiment favorable to BOcialistio
measures Involving the confiscation of - profits
and â¢ the limitation, of private management: of
ca pi tal â¢is the â¢ more; widespread and dangerous,
without .making special reference to the ami
or the avowed socialist,", we have; organized
labor and Its sympathizers supporting the idea
that '< organizations of men- may dictate to a
largo i extent ~ the i management - of; enterprises
which they/ do not own, determining; the rate
of wages and flxingtne hours of . employment.
Another illustration of this kind Â» of socialistic
sentiment is manifested In the present agita
tion to have the Government fix railroad : rates.
The attempt is made to make it appear that
the \u25a0 railroad rates are so high that - the
shippers \u25a0\u25a0â¢. and the :'' general ''-,[ public V cannot
longer stand \u25a0 the -extortion,. but must
have relief from. Congress, i Now," . the
simple incontrovertible fact la that the railroad
rates in: this country are 'â¢ far cheaper ' than
anywhere ; else in i the world.' These rates ;, in
general- are one-third', lower than those ' of
Great; Britain and France,' and: one-half lower
than - those >of German j r , where the railroads
arÂ« owned and ', operated by the Government.
An examination of rates In : the past also
shows -. there has. been an almost continuous
tendency downward.- In 1870 the , rates were
three times what they are now. v ; . ;

Ufi&appy Women'T-
Ko woman can be happy when "her;
health is undermined. 2so- woman can-
have good health while she .suffers from,
femaie weakness, InflemmaUon, ulcfcra-
tlon or any disease of the delicate worn- .
aniy organs. Xervons, gJeepless, fretful,
suffering in body and mind,- she does not
live but only exists.
More than a half a million such women i
have fonnd a perfect and permanent cure ;
for their diseased condition in the'-use of J
Doctor Pterce'B Favorite ; Prescription. ;
Women cured by this remedy say it is I
a "wonderful medicine," so perfectly
does it restore them to health and come-
liness.
There is no alcohol in "Favorite Pre-
scription,*' neither does It contain opium, J
cocaine, nor any other harmful drug. It i
is in' the strictest sense, an honest, tem-
perance medicine. Its ingredients aro
purely vegetable, and it will. agree. with
the most delicate constitution.
FS^T Don't be hypnotized, or over per-
*â ' suaded, into accepting a substitute.
This medicine has a record that's worth
far more than any difference in price.
Sick and ailing women are invited to
consult Dr. Pierce, either personally or
by letter, absolutely without charge or
fee, thus avoiding tbo unpleasant ques-
tionings, offensive examinations and ob-
noxious local treatments considered nec-
essary by many local practitioners. All
correspondence treated as strictly private
and eacrodly confidential. Write without
fear and without foe to Dr. R. V: Pierce,

. Economy .in medicine must â¢be

arid' effect. It cannot be meas-

to secure the release of ex-Senator Frank
French from ,the County. Jail failed in an
unexpected manner to-day. The bail bond
prepared by French's counsel in San
Francisco and bearing the names of the
sureties war presented to District.Attor
ney Seymour for his indorsement prepar
atory to -securing : the approval of the
Superior Court. The form of the bond
was declared by the District Attorney to
be so full; of irregularities that he felt
called upon to specify them in a formal
note to the. court, in which he refused his
indorsement. . â¢ . -\u25a0
The name French' is .spelled "Franch,"
and . the bond recites that "an indict
ment having been filed," when the statu
tory form requires, that it 'shall 'read "an
indictment having been found," Seymour
characterized the bond as' insufficient,- and
it was returned to French's friends. They
promised that they would have the bond

The productive scholar was pictured by
the speaker, and the fruits of such schol
arship were declared to be precious. The
high Ideals that should animate Phi
Beta Kappa men,' all of whom are sup
posed to be -interested in the promotion
of culture and scholarship, were referred
to by Professor Murray, wno urged that
members of the society cleave to these
ideals, and aid in furthering the means
that will enable scholars best to , serve
the world in their careers. '
President and Mrs. Wheeler will hold
a reception to the graduating class to
morrow night in Hearst Hall, but there
will be opposition to that affair, as the
seniors who did not graduate have ! or
ganized a rival reception and issued for
mal invitations, which state that the
company of the receiver is desired by
"President and Mrs. Gottleft" at their
reception -to be - given .in the' Town and

Epceches, toasts and kindred merry-mak

necessities are what some would regard
as luxuries. He must have books, and
books that are expensive ' and he must
travel, otherwise he stagnates, becomes
dead and so of no use.

been one of the most successful ever held
and much' has been shown that has helped

The leading feature of yesterday's work
was a demonstration of the X-ray, by Dr.

Stapff. The ray was used to determine
the location of a bullet passing in at "the
nasal base, penetrating the : bone ' and
passing out through the 1 palate into .the
neck. The object was to find the: bullet,
which had ' never been found, "and \ deter
mine whether it was the cause of neu
ralgic I pains in I the . region where it was
supposed to Jie. The experiment was car
ried out very successfully.
Dr. Jamea G. Sharp interested the as
sembled dentists by exhibiting sections of
skulls showing the relationship of differ
ent accessory sinuses of the nasal cavity.
Others who gave demonstrations during
the day are Dr. George N. Van Orden,

LAWYER'S STATEMENT
ASTOUNDS THE COUET
Incident That Promises to
Develop Into Scandal Is
Easily Explained.
An incident occurred in Judge .Gra
ham's court yesterday that promised for
a time to develop into a* sensation, but
subsequent explanations ! placed it : in* an
ordinary light. The' case of J. W.Hans
broug-h 1 to recover J2500 from ' A.'. ll' Mann
was on : trial, when |Â§| Attorney ... Robert
Mann, son and' attorney : for the defend
ants,' startled the . court by.? saying-:, ; 'â¢â¢.
"1 /wish to call your Honor's attention
to an unusual incident that, occurred here,
last Thursday/ Wljfn the case adjourned
that afternoon . a -stranger., in the court
room approached Juror Abraham Vane
berg and subsequently.^ took the juror
over and introduced him to Attorney I*.
H. Brownptone, who is opposing, me here.
They shook hands and bad quite an ex
tended conversation. ; I would like to have
the incident explained.". Â£
Brownstone and Juror Vaneberg were
astonished at this statement' and' both
took the stand "to explain. They, said
that the stranger referred to was a
brother of Brownstone, 1 who recently ar
rived in the city and, anxious to hear a
member of his family -plead before \the
bar, he had gron<i to court. When the case
adjourned he met in Vaneberg a\ life
long friend. 'So he introduced Taneberg
\u25a0to' his- brother and ' they ! chatted a:min
ute in; court, then ; separating. .This ex
planation' satisfied all; and the incident
was closed, Judge Graham remarking
that he" was glad to learn that the sus
picions' of ; Mr.*- Mann were not ' well
founded. ' ' \u25a0 T ',';"\u25a0

San Frarieiseo Is Made
is 3 deal in knowing how, 3
H thing is done. With some people seeing
R is believing, and it is to these people
A that the Brewers of San Francisco ad-
dress their pemsrks to-day, (^
JVhen you buy San Francisco Beer you get
the purest and highest equality of beer ithat is
made in the worlds .
V You may be skeptical about this. You may
be among those who Judge quality from a geo-
graphical standpoint; but even if you have^ ho
civic pride^ no fsith in home industry, just for
curiosity's sake visit any of the city's Breweries
and see how Beer is made by San Francisco
Brewers from Californian ingredients. ; '
There is no nook nor corner of these big
plants where you cannot go, The brooms, in
which the Beer is cooled in filtered air, are
open to you. The huge refrigerating cellar'
where the Beer is aged for months awaits your
ihspectioh. From the tinie the hops, malt and
water are put in the airtight copper caldrons
until the last bottle is f Hied, sealed and steril-
ized you can follow every step in the manufac-
ture of San! Francisco Beer.
The* Brewers of San Francisco want the
public to know r to what extremes they have gone
to produce a^ beer of perfect purity and 'excellent.,
T;^ want the-> public to \ learn v that San
Francisco labor in co-operation with California
materials can produce a Beer that is as good
as the best imported Beer, and when 3 prsctical
and Judicial 'test is given the consumers' verdict
and patronage must necessarily be for the beer
that js made in San Frsncisco. i

that proclaims its ; Parisian, origin .ewen to the unlnitated.The shirtwaist, or
blouse, is fashioned upon the plain, sacque pattern, without pleats or tucks,
and ' sets " smoothly .-\u25a0' over the" shoulders. ' The back is left quite â¢ untrimmed,
while the fronts are slit below the bust to admit. the embroidered linen, this
affording thie 1 requisite fullness to the blouse. The fastening is effected with
an overlaid box [pleat. -The sleeves are a full puff to below the elbow.. the
deep mitaine' cuff being of the embroidered goods. The skirt .is a circular
pattern/ with: panels of the embroidery inserted in slit fashion just as in the
blouse. Handsome -.triangular-shaped pieces of Russian guipure are posed at
the'.' top : of each' inserted panel, giving a touch of. distinction. to the style;
and there is a .velvet ceinture passed around the waist and, tying in a short
sash in the back... The one touchof color contrast ; may be chosen, to suit;

roe â¢â. of \u0084l the .University,
vWashington, D. - : Ci says : ' *'Th er e :is a
.very common ;but \u25a0, erroneous belief . that
gunpowder explodes ' upward and that
high explosives explode , downward.'- It
arises from the fact that if a -quantity
of ; dynamite ' be laid ; unconflned ' upon
the . surface of a: rock; on I detonating, it
the rock will often be fractured, f where
as if \u25a0 gunpowder is ;,thus " placed ;/] and
fired ; it -, produces ; no . effect * upon the
rock ;i whatever.*: 1 The ; facts ;: are -that

T^ ECXAMATION of arid lands is a fascinating. subject, and the
J"\ ? ew! y Published' official proceedings of the Twelfth National
N Irrigation Congress; which was held at El Paso last fall re
minds us of its possibilities in our own country in a more satisfying
way than could the report of any previous congress. The con
gresses heretofore worked at experimental policies which could not
stand the critical scrutiny of the statesmanship of the country but
this latest one at El Paso dealt with a.well defined and accepted
ptÂ»hcy, namely, the national . irrigation act, : wliich gives the Interior
Department power to proceed at once upon the^task, With $27,000000
'i the treasury for a starter of the operations. ' \ . , -
It is estimated that under the operations of this act -the entire
reclamation of the arid lands susceptible of such improvement oati
be accomplished without -further legislation, and that in the next
twenty years $150,000,000 worth of work will be done. It may well
be that this national enterprise is one of the most important move-;
ments now being undertaken by mankind." â¢Among the thoughts
suggested, by the coming advance in wealth' and population 'there'
are two or three about prospects, of social betterment â¢ which .present
themselves with pleasing prominence ; irrigation laws . compel' such
division of land ;\u25a0 into small holdings that a" multiplicity of \u25a0 iHder
pendent homes, will naturally result, and monopolistic tendencies
will be checked ; furthermore, in all big populations sustained- by
irrigation systems there is; suggested, encouraged, and ito a large
extent compelled, a type of effort which .leads to - the
highest civilization.^
NATIONAL IRRIGATION CONGRESS.
When the primary lav/ took effect and the primary election vvas
iuvested-with the same responsibility as the regular election, the old
habits that had ruled the voluntary and- non-statutory primary were
carried over into the new conditions. Decent citizens stayed away.
and their names on the register were voted by the push. The sup
porters of the system of municipal graft were slow to learn that
there was anything more serious in stuffing the ballot-box and voting
other names than there had been under the old plan. So, also, de
cent citizens were just as slow to learn that at the statutory primary
they were entitled .to protection in their right to vote their own
names, and could invoke the law to punish any crimes against the
primary ballot. Therefore the system had taken root in municipal
administration in spite of the legal primary. '
Just how this came to pass would not have been known except
that one citizen, Mr. Fairfax Wheelan, determined to exercise his
rights at the primary polls, and to give up one day of his time in
standing guard and observing things. As the result of orie citizen
mounting guard one day in one precinct, two members of the push
are in the penitentiary and two more are on the way there. Such a
catch in one precinct makes it probable that if such a citizen had
been on guard in every precinct in the city, the ignoble company
of ballot stuffers faced toward the jail would be much larger than
it is. The catch is large enough, however, to admonish those who
escaped arrest, and also to give decent citizens an idea of the duty
they owe to the city.
It is not necessary to go outside the roll call of the known felons
to show the need of serious attention to the primary. It is not
necessary to file a bill of particulars involving this one or that in
the city administration. It is not necessary to file charges, drum up
proofs or rave against individuals. It is not even necessary to show
personal rancor in harsh speech, for let it be remembered that for
existing offensive conditions they are to blame who neglected their
duty at the primaries. Let it be understoood as a rule of human
action, to which there are no exceptions, that if neglect leave open
an opportunity for wrongdoing advantage will be taken of it. Even
a man of fairly decent instincts, being ambitious for office and find
ing that other decent men will not pay enough attention to their
civic dut}- to help him, will turn for lielp to the push, which is al
ways in politics and always at the polls. The indifference of de
cency has forced him into alliance with indecency, the push gets a
recruit, the system a defender, and who aÂ«-e most to blame for it?
The Republican League desires to change all of this. Its pur
pose is to get on its roll the decent majority of Republicans* in the
city, to the end that a party convention may be constituted that
will take action to command the support of good citizens of all par
ties. If this can be done, then when it is done the independent* vote
of the city will do the rest. The first thing to do is to register, for
no man can vote at the primary without registering. " Men who have
a domiciliary residence out of town, but a legal and voting ( /esidence
in the city, must take time to register and to vote at the August
primary. Voters who live out of town for the summer must not
forget their duty* at the primary in their anxiety to catch the boat.
The push lives in town during the summer. Its members never,
fret about the boat, only when they are running away from an
officer or it is going to take. them to San Quentin. We have them
with us at all seasons, and they are never idle. It is their business
â¢to push in politics for the graft that is in it, and they are diligent
in business. Their nets are spread all the time. Some of them
are not lacking in certain gifts and graces, for artfulness is necessary
in their trade. We admit that there are men among them who
would not pick pockets nor pass a forged check. But the same men
will stuff a ballot-box and sign a fraudulent voucher, do blackmail
under official protection and steal money out of the public treasury
if they have the chance.
s The city needs a government that the push does not want.
That need is emphasized by the events which explain the need and
the purpose of the Republican League. Two convicts are in stripes
for crimes against the ballot. Two more men are under indictment
for the same and collateral offenses. One of these is the president
of the most powerful of the municipal boards. The* city Tax Col
lector is in jail, the embezzler of $100,000 of public money, and
guilty of more squalid offenses against decency and good -morals.
Deputies in the city offices are shown to be neglectful of duty, if
not criminally indifferent to 'their responsibility. ,
Look where one will throughout the municipal administration
and there is no sign in the places of authority where it should be of
sympathy with the popular aspiration for good government. The
sordid spirit of the push is upon it all. The subject studied seems
to be how much can be made out of official opportunity and keep
out of jail. The city government is oriented wrongly. It is not
squared with the right compass. It mistakes the system worked
by the push for that four square public sentiment which should be
the inspiration of good government A complete change is needed
There should be an administration that will avert its face and favor
from the push. Try it once. If the first effort succeed, if we get a
decent and clean government once, the effect will be so gratefully
appreciated that there will never be a lapse. - \
â¢npHESE are recruiting days for the Republican League. It is
| saved the task" of explaining its purpose. Events are suffi
\* ciently explanatory. It was an old habit, going, back to the
time of the partnership of political bosses, for citizens to avoid the
primary. When there was no primary except the volunteer action
of bosses or part}- committees, usually expressed in a rough and tum
ble meeting in or near a drinking place, it was made so unpleasant
and irequcntly so dangerous for a decent man to attend that all
such stayed atvay and the push voted their names and rioted and
had rough house, to celebrate the first step in politics leading
joward providing a government for the city! Such primaries were
the fountain head of municipal administration. What wonder that
it had faults!
THE REPUBLICAN LEAGUE.
MICHAEL HALEY Is a man of regu
lar habits, though most , of them
-,_-are not the, sort of habits that.pro
fessors of, ethics recommend ; to '-. their, pu
pils. His *â¢' ordinary- occupation ; is '\u25a0), the
driver of the wagon in one of the penal
institutions of a big city. This he varies
â¢whenever his sen
tence expires by, go-
Ing home.
, Mrs. Haley is con
siderably older than
her husband, whom
she married because
he was such a fine
figure of a man." She
had supported her
self for many years
before Michael's six
feet of \ sturdiriess
disturbed* her maid
en fancy. The neigh
bors say she jiid all
the courting, and
even ,the proposing,
and it is certain that
the fact of her being
an â¢ accomplished
bushelwoman or fin
isher of line gar
ments and in receipt
of a good weekly
wage' had -more to
do with Michael's
acceptance of -her
than either her
years or her beauty.
Julia, Mrs. Haley,
is a treasure." Her
little room ;is as
clean as soap and
water can make it,
her. clothes are al
ways neatly washed
and ironed and hung
up under a cloth in
the corner by the
bed, and she is trust
worthiness itself to
her employers, and
to the neighbors
willing and generous
to a fault. But she
has one fatal weak
ness: Though she al
ways knows just
row long Michael is
sent up for, she has
never been able to
figure out the day;
when he may be ex
pected home. Either
it runs on so far
past the time that she gives up looking
for him, or he appears on the scene two
or three days in advance. In" either event
she is taken by a surprise that bids fair
to become perennial, \u25a0\u25a0',
When Michael is released it . is his in
variable practice to make as straight a
line as possible for â¢ the little room his
wife maintains.' If the door is 'locked it
requires nothing more than a shove of
his powerful shoulder to open; it. Julia
always promises him when he is on his
way to punishment that she will be at
home to meet him. If she ever were the
result might possibly be different, but she
never ' has been so far, for : the reason
stated. So Michael , i 3 invariably, disap
pointed and, left to his"" own devices,
temptation seizes him and makes him its
own. :'>^V; ; i
His first act after he has verified Julia's
absence is to gather together her little
wardrobe of clean-starched calicoes I and
other garments and take them to the
pawnbroker's. This he follows with the
bed, the two chairs and the cooking uten
sils.. In fact, he cleans out the room ex
cept \u25a0 for the stove and â¢an old and bat
tered milk can, which he regards as com
panion and friend. Having sold or pawned
Julia's effects for; what.he can get.^he
buys a demijohn of liquor and a peck of
onions. ; Filling the milk can , with < water
at. the. hydrant below, -he retires' to , the
stripped and . ungarnished ; room for self
communion and gratification of his pecu
liar and besetting sin. -
Michael sits \u25a0' on the clean s floor, : takes
a swicr of whisky. a bite of onion and a
drink of water. Aft
er the three have
been ; combined - ', in
varying i proportions,;
it , is \u25a0 his , custom to
break forth ]in song."
It is a fine, powerful
voice he has, and
the ;. neighbors hear
and know, that he is
home. â¢ -They. 'also
knowL that;
thing will presently,
be 'doing, and they \u25a0
generally notify the
patrolman on the
beat. 'l At least thai
official is always ; on
hand at the climax.'
Â§ Michael ' Haley iis
not \u25a0&] composer, .but
he: weaves together
coon - songs s and \u25a0 his
Connemara . dialect

Mayall, as Richard Atherton, the young

for by Henry Shumer, ] the villain.' The
deed, was an accident; Jjut it. Jpossessed
the reality it was expected [ib convey to.
the fluttering hearts in the â¢ galiery. /
It was in the third act where Mayall
encounters the dark villain in the "rolling
null of the Stockton Iron Company." To
get rid of his i adversary Shumer strikes
two mock blows with the butt end of a
revolver. MayaH's part is to "duck."
According to mutual arrangement the
"ducking" -and blows are fixed so that
the villain's blows cleave nothing but
the cold air of the Central stage, while
to the spellbound audience the skull and
gun seem to make forcible connections.

at the headquarters of the San ; Franf
Cisco \u25a0Republitan- League, 636 Market
street, last evening to discuss topics re
lating to the organization of the; forces
of good citizenship in these, districts. 1
The representation 6f the Thirty-fourth
was quite prominent. Fred Severance,
P. J. Grey, Alpheus Duff ee . and J. J\

men .of the district/were : present.
Other representatives attending were

David Ross, E. M. Ritter, "Joseph
Belcher, William Gleesonandv'Arthur

rill, who is classed' as i "a Ruef follower,
did not attend. -
The Thirty-third District was also
ably -represented.- The- factional dif
ferences in the ; Thirty-third -are not
obstinate. .Â» ' .
George D. Clark, permanent chair-v
man of the league's committee on or-A
ganization, was not present last night,
but the , delegations from the Thirty-,
third and Thirty-fourth submitted their
recommendations to Daniel, H. â¢ Ryan,
Fairfax H. Wheelan, Richard J. Welch,
David Rich, E. J. Bowes, John ; Lack
mann and John D. Daly. Other dis-;
tricts will be considered to-morrow
night. >:
It is gossip in political circles that
the Schmitz Central Club, an organiza
tion which was created by A. Ruef, for
special du ty . in the municipal campaign
two years ago, has put eight organizers
in the field at- a salary of $100 a month
for each organizer. It is said that Ruef
is planning for reorganization; of the
Union Labor party. Many of the in
fluential labor leaders who":' supported
Eugene, E. Schmitz in 1903 are openly
opposed to Ruef, hence- there is a feel
ing in the' r Schmitz ' camip that Ruef's
personality should not be conspicuously,
obtruded in labor,, circles? / The notion'
is entertained that better results would
be accomplished by converting
Schmitz Central ' Club into an employ
ment agency, with Ruef behind the
scenes to prompt the agents.
The State Board of Harbor Commis
sioners will meet to-morrow afternoon.
Rumor is rife that Charles H. Spear and
John :D. Mackenzie will stand in -for
Senator John H. Nelson's appointment
to the position of superintendcntT'of
tugs ; and dredgers, the place formerly
held by ex-Senator French. '. ,
The claim is advanced by Nelson's
supporters that he is loyal -to the Re
publican;,-State administration A and
demonstrated his loyalty at Sacramento
during the last session of ",the Legisla
ture and therefore should not be turned
down because^, he -trains with Ruef. .
"-Republicans wh<K, are rln sympathy
with the movement for better municir'
pall government; in,, San; Francisco Yap- S
prehend that the'appointmerit of Nelson
.would be construed as an i'lndorsement
of Ruef and. would"- enable the directing
power of tho : Schmitz following '; to]pro
claim, "See,' the' State .administration
as well ; as - that 'of the "city recog

WRIGHT "ADJUDGED ' INS ANE.^rJames P,
Wrlghtwaa adjudged : of unsound mind: yester
day by Dr. McOetUsan. AV right was formerly
a clerk for. Fred E.-, Booth,": commission | broker. 5
Some - time ' ago i several orders > for' Immense
shipments of . lumber/ were oent - to lumbermen
up north,'; and, upon' Investigation the.'. orden
were traced to Wright. .
| J. Mozetti, a cousin- of the complain
ant, testified;: that B." Mozetti' had on
March 22 last, asked him \in : Edwards'
presence :if he -could s change $20. ', He
replied that; he had ;is,'-.whichhe gave
to :B. Mozetti, v who. then handed \ the
coin to* Edwards.' -'Thomas. Riley, a milk
wagon driver, that he \u25a0 had
heard Edwards tell Mozetti one evening
that it would-be all right to leave his
cows "out", that- night after! Mozetti had
paid Edwards 7 some 'money ., which the
former, took from a: coin -sack/
Thomas - J.' ;' Rlley, ; Va'v saloon-keeper,
said he had; received a * telephone mes
sager from some one '\u25a0 who " said .he was
a friend of ' Mozetti to the effect that
the poundmen were on -the" way to Mo
zetti's place and to inform the latter
to drive his cows into the corral. At
torney Miller said he would at the next
meeting put other \ witnesses 'on: the
stand to testify, that money had been
paid' to the poundmen.
. B. Mozetti denied that he .had - told
Unger- that Supervisor Rea was his
cousin and that; the official would* see
that the money .paid for the release
of the. cows was returned to him: Mo
zetti also denied that he had told Un
ger,-.that^he had been offered $200 ; to
testify that he had paid the poundmen
for protection.-- Mozetti said Supervisor
Rea .was;, not . his -cousin and repeated
hjs ; former! evidence that " he 1 had. paid
Edwards $15 at three different times
and $15 to linger on another occasion.
* G. H. Roundy testified that the fence
around \ Mozetti' s corral was j old and
ready .to fall at any time and that the
poundmen .were hampered in' their work
in the : outlying districts through warn
ings given to dairymen; by ; friends of
the , approach of Jthe 'poundmen. :J.
Stevenson .testified that one of Mozetti's
herders had told him it was fixed with
the \u25a0 poundmen .to let the cattle roam
at large. . \u25a0 â¢ \ ;>'^
\u0084 ; The' investigation will be resumed
next Tuesday at 3 p.m.
. T The ; Supervisors' Police Committee
yesterday. resumed its investigation into
the charges .made; by- Bl , Mozetti, {a.
'dairyman,-; -that {he , had \u25a0 paid , money to
Superin tendent A.' L. Unger.of the P.ub
lic pound. \u25a0and to iDeputy^ Poundmaster
pound ing of his cbws^f or being at large.
The charges grew, out of the petition
nied byv Mozetti? for -the'; funds of $315
paid to^,the pokndmen for the release
of 105 cows .which' had ;been; impounded.
As .'Mozetti's (witnesses; cannot speak
English^. Supervisor | Rea : was pressed
into service^as interpreter. .
-Mozetti had W. B.; Miller for his atr
torney and C. B. Holbrook, secretary of
the " Society* for the Prevention of
Cruelty -to , which , has : con
ducted :the pound ever since H. O. Irvln,
the Mayor's appointee, iwas ousted; con
ducted-the case for. the accused men. \u25a0\u25a0â¢ \u25a0
Al the close of the announced pro
gramme Mrs. Henry C. Coe, who with
Madame Ysaye was a guest of the club,
made a sprightly liitle talk upon a pro-
Ject of unitinr the female descendants
of New lingland women in California into
*n organization such as exists upon the
Atlantic coast. That the matter may be
thoroughly canvassed â and perhaps a club
terminated Mrs. Coe will entertain at
luncheon at the St. Francis on Monday
next about twenty club presidents, and
later, from 3 to 5 o'clock, she will give a
reception to the clubwomen of San Fran
ciscoâquite a little bunch of women when
they get together. These societies whose
character depends upon lineage seem to
be growing in popularity. If they steer
clear of the shoals of snobbishness they
subserve many worthy purposes, but
there is in most of them an air of "I am
nicer than thou."
The California Club held a vigorous ses
sion yesterday afternoon at ita clubrooms
in the Young Men's Christian Association
buildir.g under the direction of Mrs. E. I*
â¢Jaldwin, chairman of the civic depart
ment. The following topics were discussed
in interesting fashion: "A Working Wom
an's Co-operative Home," Mrs. May
Woodman; '"The New Child Labor Law,"
Joseph Chamberlain; "Camp Life in the
High Sierra*.'- William E. Colby. : "
home, where the pair will be deluged
with entertainmentâ lest, indeed, they be
wi^e enough to Reek out the solitude of
the Sabin country home, and there en
joy the quiet of their prenuptlal days.
But now that the story's out, congratu
lations are threatening to swamp tbe
young lady and her family.
The lucky chap that's won her is said
to be on his way to visit at the Sabin
To be sure, the Wise Ones long ago
presaged Just such an Interesting climax
to that interesting meeting, and the
scores of interesting meetings that fol
lowed ; but when the Twenty-eighth was
ordered away to Fort Snelling by an un
feeling inconsiderate War Depart
ment, it was supposed that the affair
was merely an incident of a very gay
winter for a very charnrtng maid and a
gallant young soldierâ simply an incident.
But when Miss Sabin and her debutante
sister. Miss Pearl, accepted the invita
tion of Captain and Mrs. Thomas Pierce
to vi&it them at Fort Snelling. the "inci
dent" began to grow grave, as "incidents"
will, when two interesting young people
are left together in the delightful pro
pinquity of an army post.
And there's where the handsome eol
dicr pleaded his cause â and won.
There are those who think that the
sly little maid had given her promise to
Captain BJornsted before ehe took leave
of him in February, and has kept the
tweet secret within her family ever since,
but ihat is conjecture.
Since the coming-out of Miss Pearl,
and later, of Miss Irene, the young la
dies have been conspicuously identified
with the army set, attending all toff
winter's hops at the Presidio and the
delightful little suppers that followed.
It was at one of these affairs that
the dashing soldier met the maid who I
has since promised to wed him.
Another triumph for a son of Mars, cold
Corblnism notwithstanding: .
Yesterday came the announcement of
the engagement of charming Pearl Ba
bin. daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John I.
Safoin. to Captain A. W. BJornsted, so
well remembered at the Presidio, where
he vras stationed with the gallant Twen
ty-eighth.

Facts of Family Kelation
"An ;, element of; mystery surrounds
the sudden appearance ' of A. C. Hinkle
In { the case of . the Mariano E. ; Goazales
estate. He alleges that he is a son of
the deceased pioneer and is . entitled to
one-third of the J300.000 left by thÂ«

Now , comes U inkle _with the -'claim
that the Rico heirs are -entitled to
nothing, and that; all the wealth , of
the deceased belongs to' the widow,
the daughter, and ', himself, a son.
Winkle sets forth" that there are pa
pers^ in .existence fntwhicb Gonzalea
admitted that ho was the father of the
claimant.". Hinkle docs- not say these

where they can \u25a0bo had.' , He - does not
say who his mother was of is, nor will
his : attorneys â¢ divulge the secret. â¢
"I do not. care to discuss ,the case,"
said ; Judsre N. A. Dorn, . chief counsel
for che. claimant, "nor do I care to
who .was the mother of the claimant.
All I can 3Â« y is that I am satisfied
with the proofs."
" Thus is another interesting phase
added to an already interesting .con
test, made remarkable through - the
fact that . ovcry ' person connected with

lin. . Pinkham's Advice '. Saves Many
From this Sad and Costly Experience.
Ifc a bnt
yB/j;2!^/S l rfQw7S patients lying
white .beds are women and girls who
.are awaiting- or recovering from opera-
tions made necessary by neglect.
' Every , one "of t these \ patients - had
plenty of warning in that bearing down
\u25a0 feeling, pain at the left or right of the
womb,' nervous exhaustion; pain in the
small of the -back. : leucorrhcea, diz2i-
ness,\ flatulency, displaceaaents of the
womb or irregularities. All of these
symptoms â¢ are \u25a0 indications - of - an ; un-
healthy condition of ' the ovaries or^
rwomb, and if not heeded -the trouble ;
will make headway until the penalty
: has to be paid by a dangerous opera-
tion| and a lifetime of impaired useful-
ness :at best, while in many, cases the
results are fatal.
'TheT following letter should bring
hope to suffering women. Miss Luella
Adams,of the Colonnade Hotel, Seattle,
\u25a0Wash., writes:
Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â
- I. About t^o years ago I was a great suf-
ferer from a severe female trouble, pains and
headaches. , The doctor prescribed for me and
finally told me that I had a tumor on the
'. womb and must undergo an operation If I
wanted to get well. I felt that this was my
death warrant, but I spent hundreds of dol-
lars for medical help, but the tumor kept
growing. >\ Fortunately , I ' corresponded with
an aunt in the New England States, and she
advised me to take Lydia E. Pinkham's Veg-
etable Compound, as it was said to cure tu-
mors. I did so and immediately began to
Improve in health, and I was entirely cured,
the tumor disappearing entirely; without an
operation. I wish every suffering woman
would try this great preparation." -
V Just as surely, as Miss Adams was
cured of the troubles enumerated in
her letter, just so surely will Lydia E.
Pinkham's - Vegetable \u25a0 Compound euro
every woman in the land who suffers
from womb troubles, . inflammation of

IN SECOND TOURXAMENT
Meantime the fog held thick. Shortly
after 3 p. ra. the Hamburg and ASlsa
arrived and. joined* the fleet. At- 3:10
the committee. boat went alongside the
Valhalla and notified the Earl of Craw
ford that the race would be postponed
until noon to-morrow. Other, yachts
were notified by the committee boat
â¢and were quickly snugged- down for
the night. All - are expected to \u25a0be at
the starting line to-morrow.
. As the , night . wore on the weather
signs care little ' hope^Jo ' the anxious
watcbtrs on the -yachts. A cold, misty
rain and fog:, were' over the lower , bay
and the wind blew a fresh breeze from
.the east. The forecast is for rain. to
moTTOw, Jrat the racing yacht' skippers
are hoping ' for enough wind to blow
away. tSxtt mist and let them over the
IfaM.
The Government tug Vigilant, with
Commander Hebbinghaus of tne Ger
man navy, tbe Emperor's official repre
sentative, on board. Joined. the fleet,
and two excursion steamers heavily
laden with passengers and a dozen tugs
about among the racers as they
'lay at anchor, while their :>. passengers
cheered the Amejlcan, English and
; German craft impartially and their
bands saluted with tbe "Wacht -Am
Rhein," "Rule, J3rittanla" or '.'Yankee
.Doodle." Captain Charles Barr was on
board tbe big three-master. Atlantic
' and hJs splendid record of victories in
America's cup defenders, together with
the fact that the yacht is known to
be able and speedy, led many to re
~ gard her as 1 a likely winner.
BOATS ARE SXDCCED DOWX
Though the starting committee had
announced that the boats would be sent
away unless the fog was of the '"'pea
soup" variety,, tbe.- conditions, were
clearly dangerous. There was a splen
did Bailing breeze outside the Hook,
but it was dead ahead, and to have, at
tempted to send the yachts away in it
would probably have resulted in col
lisions as soon as they began to beat
to windward. The start of the race
liad been set for 2:15 p. ra., but at that
hour only six of the racers lay at
anchor within the Hook. They were
tbe British ship Valhalla and the
American schooners Utowana, Atlantic,
Thistle, Hildegarde and Endymion.
The Sunbeam, Apache and Fleur de Lis
had not joined the fleet at .nightfall,
having remained at anchor in . the up
per harbor.
CHEWS ARE SERKXADEIJ.
CONDITION'S*'- ARIS DANGEROUS.
The smallest yacht in the fleet, the
American schooner Fleur de Las, owned
by Dr. Lewis A. Stimson of the New
York Yacht Club, was run down by a
scow in tow while tlie yacht was at
anchor in the lower bay before day
light to-day. She was towed into Erie
Basin and the tiamage was repaired.
Dr. Stinson announced that be would
be ready to start in the .race to
morrow.
NEW TOEK, May 16. â Eight of the

shelter of Sandy"Hook to-night, for the
start of the race had been postponed
until noon to-morrow because of the
fog. A denee blanket of mist hung
over the Hooli and the sea outside,
where the start was to have been made.
At nightfall there was nothing to in

The Gold selling stakes, over six fur

unsatisfactory contest. Backed from 1121 12

saddle, led from the .- &.art, beating the
even money :i favorite'; David Boland three
wide-open lengths ' Jn 'l:l4%. } Sad Sam, the
8 f o 5 second choice, ran a dull race, I fin
ishing.third; four lengths farther off. ; On
the day preceding Interlude ; started in a
cheap event, failing to evoke any. favor
able comment by his display of speed.
Apparently the complexion of things did
not please the judges, for all bets on the
race were declared off. > This afforded the
first chance to win a \ bet' that had' come
to the third-class /hustlers during the
meeting, for 101 tickets were torn up and
thrown on the ground. McClees, the pilot
of Sad Sam, was suspended, and .O.
Chandler, who rode the favorite, David
Boland, remains . swinging on the gate
pending further investigation.
Cooler weather prevailed, to the appar

The damages to the British ship
Peter Iredale appear to be of a much
oiore serious character than at first re
ported. When the news of her colli
sion with the British ship Cambermerc
in the harbor of Melbourne on May 10
was received the damages were said to
be slight. Now by advices which came
from London yesterday the marine sur
veyors at Melbourne state that they
rind her starboard quarter badly stove,
her frames broken and chain plates
and riggring carried away. They esti
mate that it will cost $3250 to repair
her damages.
During: her last trip to this port the
iredale came near s^oingr to the bot
tom of the ocean. When off Cape Horn,
on September 10, 1904, she ran into a
terrible hurricane. She was thrown on
Tier beam ends and her port rail was
under water for twelve hours. Her
masts and sails were blown away and
one of her apprentices was washed
overboard and drowned.
She sailed from this port on Febru
ary IS with a cargo of lumber and
merchandise for Melbourne. The Peter
lredaJe is a four-masted steel bark of
1594 tons net. She is 287:5 feet in
length, 3Â» feet in breadth and 23:5
feet in depth. She was built in Mary
port in 1890. â¢
Her commander. Captain H. Law
rence, has been particularly unfortun
ate during the la*t few years. He is
popular with his brother skippers, but
he seems to have run into a streak of
bad luck. On December 16. 1891. he
put into port with the British bark
Kinkora in distress. The Kinkora was
in terrible shape and practically dis
mantled. She was bound from New
castle to Portland. Or., with coal.

The weather was generally cool and cloudy
at the beginning of the week and warm and
clear at U*e close. Ugfat rain feU in all sec
â¢Jjas bat caused no damage, and the injury
by rain at the close of the preceding week
was not as serious as expected. Some grain
was lodged aod cut hay was damaged. Light
frosts occurred on the 9th in Lake, HumhoTdt
and Contra Costa counties, but no damage
resulted. Crop prospects are better than at
this time last week, and tbe outlook is good
'or a heavy yield of hay and at least an
average yield of grain la moet places. Hops
are in fair condition, but backward, aad win
be Improved by the warm weather. Late
sown grain was greaUy benefited by recettt
rains. Sogmr beets, beans and vegetables are
doing wea. Green reed Is plentiful. Peacoes
and prcnes are improving and fair yields are
now expected. Tbe flrrt Royal apricots were
Rhfppod from Vavcaville dortngr tbe week.
Vineyards are in excenent condition. "rtÂ«e
cherry crop is exceedingly light.
6AN JOAQUIN VALLEY.
Late sown wheat was greatly benefited by
the recent rains and is in excellent condition
ia rnÂ«* places.; Tfce Carnage to grain aad
fcay by ttfc rains of the. preceding week was
less than expected, though In some sections
considerable grain was lodged and cut hay
badiy daiiiaeed. The outlook for good crops
of crair. arm hay is much better than at this
time last week, and a continuance of present
condiUons*wi:i rapidly improve ail crops. Hay
ing is in progress in nearly all sections and
the yield :s large. Hope are somewhat back
ward, but improving. Beans, sugar beets and
vegetables are doing well, and green feofl 16
plentiful.
Vineyards are in good condition and mak
ing fair progress, but require renewed cultiva
tion. Cherries are exceedingly light in all
sections, and it la reported that the total
yield will not be more than one-third of the
average for the last three years. Other de
ciduous fruits, except peais. give promise of
eood cross.
SACRAMENTO VALLEY.
\u25a0Cool and cloudy weather continued daring
the first of the week* with light rain, and was
followed by dear weather and higher tem
perature. A severe thunderstorm, accom
panied by hail and rain, occurred In the
vicinity of Sacramento on tbe 11th, damaging
grain, hay and fruit to some extent, in a very
limited area. The rains caused very little
damage la other 6ectlone, and the heavy rains
of the preceding week were less injurious than
expected. Considerable hay had been cut and
â¢was damaged, but late sown wheat was
preatly benefited and â¢Â« now in excellent con
dition. Tne observer at Red Bluff reports 1 that
the yields of grain, hay and all fruit except
pears aad prunes will be the heaviest In ten
years. Rust has appeared in a few wheat
fields, but the warm, clear weather is having
a beneficial effect. Hops are improving rajK
idly and vegetables are making good growth.
VinÂ«?yaxiis are looking well, but will have to
be cultivated again. Citrus fruits are in good,
condition.

New York Stock List.
NEW YORK, May 16. â Some considerable
declines were effected in prices of stocks In
the course of an hour's business after the
opening to-day and a creeping upward move
ment followed for the most of the day. A
large proportion of the day's total transac
tions was . done during .the first hour, and
after that business waa little more than
nominal. Some items of information in the
day's news offered a nominal cause for the
setback in prices, but the market is best exr
plained by the discouragement of the pro-;
fessionsl element over the utter- lack of suc
cess in attracting any outside interest. While
the great ease of money aod thÂ« abundance
of funds apparently available rather diverts
opinion from attributing money market affairs
as the reason for the present neglected stock
market, it is open to question whether a de
elre to conserve the money market ' has not
more or less to do with the attitude of pas
sive discouragement of speculation ; which has
been adopted by the banking and financial
world. Some very heavy . operations are pro
ceeding in the money market and there has
been a very large shifting of loan accounts
to consequence in- the last two days. The
taking up of nearly $15,000,000 of Government
deposits from the national banks is being car
ried through and it is surmised that pro
vision Is being " made for the calling ot 60
per cent of the underwriting subscriptions
to the $100,000,000 Pennsylvania convertible
bond issue. Next week, on May 25. sub
scriptions to the amount of nearly $60,000,000
to the Japanese loan issue will be payable
in New. York. The money market, in spite
of these enormous transactions and the prep
arations for them, is absolutely unruffled. and
iÂ«. in fact, working easier. It can be under
stood however that a sense of reiyf. ma;
be felt over the freedom of the money market
from extensive speculative entanglements dur
ing the conduct-- of 'these operations. There
are- some counter influences, notably the ex
pectation that the Government bonds to secure
the deposits now being returned will be em
ployed for taking out additional banknote cir
culation. The April foreign trade statement,
showing an excess in value of exports well
above that for the April of the preceding
year, gives assurance of the resources of- the
exchange market, on which special demands
are now made in preparation for remittances
on. the Japanese loan. Of the more im
mediate influences on to-day's market the
foreign political disturbance was most con
spicuous. This was due to the reported seiz
ure by Germany -of a Chinese port and the
official denial from Berlin only partly re
lieved .speculative markets from this effect.
Our grain markets ' were more affected \u25a0 than
stocks. A two-fold influence in both markets
also was the weathfr news from' the crop
regions. Extensive rains .were reported In the
Southwest delaying, corn . planting and .dam
aging winter wheat. \u25a0 But -the amount of stock
brought on the market by these factors was
exceedingly small. The easy yielding of prices,
however under the light offerings discour
aged the professional attempts to get the
market up. The marking up of St. Paul late
in the day was attributed to a traders' , move
ment designed for effect on the general list,"
but the closing was heavy for the smallest
day's business of the year.
Bonds were dull and heavy. Total sales,'
par value. $2,255,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
call. - -

Wounded Man Saj i s Black
mail Was Tried on Him
Georse W. O'Brien* one of the pro
Â»rie*nrs of the Unlon-Sqoare Transfer
Companr<i was perhaps fatally shot
â¢boat 10:30 o'clock last night by Sam
uel Cohen, a photographer at Habe-
aJehfs. Cohen chased his victim down
Tan Ness arrrnae and fired four shots,
two of which took: effect^ In O'Brien's
body. One of the ballets 'imbedded it
self la tiie brain, tbousn the patient
may recover.
At the hospital O'Brirn said Cohen
tried to blackmail him a few days n&o,
also that Cohen demanded $300, then
a diamond ring, Jnst before the shoot
taj;, &\u25a0 (he men parleyed on the steps
of the old library building. O'Brien
\u25a0ays that just after he denied Intimacy
with Mrs. Cohen be vrss shot.
Mrs. Cohen's relations with O'Brien are
said to be the cause of the shooting.
O'Brien left his mother's house, 513 Van
. Ness avenue, about 10:33 p. m. The aged
â¢woman kissed him good-night. Then she
watched him walk to his office and sleep
ing-room in the old Mercantile Library
building. 51S Van Ness avenue. As he
mounted the ftcps she saw Cohen sud
denly step from a passageway and fire at
her son. As Cohen shot O'Brien ran. Co
hen followed him. emptying his revolver
at the victim and shooting after O'Brien
had fallen. Two shots â¢ took effect.
One was defected by a rib. The other
pierced the skull and brain. Mrs. O'Brien
ran after her son in an effort to-save his
life. Then she fainted and was picked up
by neisrhVx>rs. Cohen fled up Golden Gate
avenue, where he was captured by two
witnesses of the shooting, Henry Heaton
and August Xorber, who turned him over
to Policemen Cornelius. Mitchell and
Hottetter. He was htld at the City Pris
on pending the result of O'Brien's injury.
Cohen and his wife lived with O'Brien's
mother. A week ago Cohen sent his wife
to Los Ar.gelts to get her away from
O'Brien. He says he knew that O'Brien
and his wife had been unduly intimate.
Yesterday afternoon he bought a revolver
and went out to hunt the alleged wrecker
of his household.
O'Britn refused to talk on the wife
trouble. He says Cohen attempted to
b^icirmail him. He refused to pay and
WÂ£s asked by Cohen for his diamond
Ting. He refused again to pay and sought
the services of Attorney Michael H. Her
nan of 503 California street. O'Brien says
his refusal to pay Cohen resulted in the
. shooting.
O'Brien is 22 years old. The bullet in
,h:s brain pierced his forehead. Xo in
.jurious symptoms due to its presence are
manifest and if no suppuration or hemor
. rhage sets in he has an even chance for
his life. If he lives he will- carry the lead
en missile in his brain for the remainder
cf his life. O'Brien was treated by Dr.
Pinkhara at the Central Emergency Hos
pital.
Thomas Kennedy, of the District At
torney's office, hurried to the hospital to
get O'Brien's statement. It was to the
effect that Cohen again tried blackmail
just before the 6hooting.
- "He met me on the steps of the Library
\u25a0building," said O'Brien, "and demanded
â¢ J500,' which I refused, saying I did not
possess so much. He then demanded my
/diamond ring, and when I refused it he
charged me with criminal relations with
Mrs. Cohen. This I denied, after which
â¢ he began to fire."

-at present employed on special duty
. for the GrauÂ«l Jury, was promoted to

Eallivan, captain of .the' guard -at Jail
No. 2, was prornotfcd to the position of
Depnty ?*crtff made vacant by the pro
motion of CoyJe. :.".';;
nians who witnessed her /'hula-hula" and
"hootchie-kootchie" dances while she was
a stellar attraction of the Columbian Ex
position had told her that San Francisco
was athirst for terpslchorean abandon
such as she displayed, and it was with
expectation of making a terrific hit that
she decided to give this city a taste of her
professional quality ere she opens a.
season at the coming Portland Fair. Her
surprise and chagrin could therefore be
better Imagined and described when the
law's restraining hand was laid upon her.
James Reese, who was arrested for
conducting: the exhibition given by Miss
Haas^ also deplored the unlooked-for,, le
galized Puritanism that stopped his show.
Prior to his arrival here he had been
led by common report to regard San
Francisco as a city "wide open." "with
the "lid off" and "never dark.** Instead
of finding these charming communal
traits, however, he had been confronted
with an every-day straightlacedness that
made a Connecticut Sabbath appear gay
by comparison. His getting out of court
would be quickly followed by. his getting
out of a town in which he. felt lonesome
without a hymn book in his pocket. .
The policeman's description of the
dance . performed by Miss Haas was at
tentively listened to by. Judge Cabaniss
and a crowded auditorium, and at its
conclusion the witness recounted a ru
mor to the effect that gentlemen who
paid 10 cents for the enjoyment to be de
rived from seeing either the "hula-hÂ«ila"
or the "hootchie-kootchie" were covertly
solicited to pay an extra" two-bits and be
privileged to perceive Miss Haas in a
private exhibition that would eclipse in
magnetism .. her public endeavor even as
the inanimate Venus de Milo â¢ attracts
masculine art lovers who could not be
bribed to devote more than passing
glance to a statue of Dr. Mary Walker.
Those who gave pecuniary response to
the solicitation, the report said, were in
structed to pass through a door and wait,
and when they obeyed the instruction
they found themselves in an alley and
the door behind them locked. As a rule,
instead of waiting they hastened to steer
others against the same game.
It was to the alleged violation of ordi
nance Xo. 1059, prohibiting indecent ex
hibitions, that the Judge confined his
finding-, however, there being no formal
charge on file relative to the obtaining
of money under false pretenses. His
Honor held it questionable that dances
such as Policeman McManus had
blushingly witnessed Miss Haas per
form could be brought within the pro
hibitory scope of the . ordinance, inas
much as they are not essentially im
moral, any more than certain painted
or chiseled presentments of the human
form- divine could be so designated.
It all depends, the court held, upon the
point of view from which such exhibi
tions are observed. If approached with
prurient mind they are reprehensible,
but if gazed upon purely, in an artistic
light they arc educational. Therefore
he would dismiss the case; with a warn
ing, however, to , Miss \u25a0- Haas and her
manager that- they would practice dis
cretion by reserving their performances
for the edification and instruction of
visitors to the- Lewis and Clark centen
ary celebration.
Mrs. C. A- Baxter told Judge Mo gan
that for eight months prior to her visit
to San Jose; with Dr. Herbert Thorn

"Beer," Mr. McGilvray i remarked, "is
slops and no drink for a lady."
To his inexpressible astonishment Mrs.
Nelson retorted most "Do'you
mean to say," she snapped, "that I'm ndt
a lady?" ..Mr. McGilvray hastened , to as
sure her" that such was not the" impres
sion his comment was intended; to con
vey. The speech, he explained,.! was aimed
as a reproach at J Mr. . Aiken for; having
neglected to^consult .her taste * before he
obtained the liquor, but her wrath de
clined to be appeased by what she termed
his "gab." Then, -as; he stated to Judge
Fritz, "one ' word t -borryed another," un
til an excrutiatingly-stinging word > from
her provoked him to " lay : on : hands. j In
an instant -she seized : the -can, , then but
half emptied, dashed . the ' contents in â¢ his
face and smote his bared 'head ..with a
sharp edge of the vessel itself,- the blow
cutting a gash both deep and long."" He
fled from her presence . and the house,
and it .wasbv means of tracking.' bis

the : defendants <-, had â¢ paid $100.000 Â» on . ; ac
count of; the \ purchase price Â» of one-half
of the Amador .Tuanel. Milling and Min
ing Company, but; that they had refused
to live up to their \u25a0agreement ; '\u25a0\u25a0to pay an
additional J150.000. out of. the dividends of
their share " of the 'stock and by' arbi
trary . means; had prevented the , plaintiffs
from developing' the mine, theVeby pre^
venting s the stock from reaching the
value it otherwise would have done.
'. "And we Trtll \u25a0' prove,";,' continued
Shortrldge,*"that In April of, 1887 John
Flenmiingr, whose ; Interests 'William
Flfmmlng succeeded ' to, \u25a0 , approached
xMr. Nevllls during a meeting of the di
rectors of the company and : said he
would kill him If he persisted In levy-
Ing jan assessment ' on the shares of the"
corporation. Mr. Nevills left the room,'
but - this was not â¢ through any fear of
personal ' Injury. Oh no, indeed, it was
only to avoid trouble.
"And ; through : the failure to ralsg'this
assessment the: property, which warS'and
Is of \u25a0 great j value, j was \u25a0 riot : aeveloped 'as
it 'was intended it should have been and
the contention of thedefendantsthat'the
dividends of the company were not \ what
they, .expected , they, would be was the
result of .their Town acts and due to no
fault of the plaintiffs."
; In a : cross-complaint Flemming and his
associate defendants demand the $100,000
paid on account wof. the \ purchase "re-,
turned to - them, claiming ' that the value
of - the : mine ' was less .than -represented
and ., that instead of paying - any ; more
for "the stock, they should be remunerated,
for what they- have already lost.: "

When her husband .departed for the
Alaska fisheries Mrs. Fannie Nelson,
buxom and forty, took Dan McGilvray
and Billy Aiken. friends of Mr. Nelson,
to board and lodge at her home ; at 163
Tehama street. The gentlemen vied with
each other -in lightening up the gloom
of a household 'temporarily deprived of
its mastuline head, and in their amiable"
rivalry the lady of the house was made
the recipient of much liquefied as, well as
unlimited oral *, tenders of \u25a0 sympathy.
While she had never expressed within
hearing of Mr. / McGilvray a preference
for any particular kind of tipple, he had
observed that she seemed to relish beer
less than either, whisky or, wine, so when
he found her being treated by Mr. Aiken

The doctor acknowledged that his re
lationship to Mrs. Baxter had been lm-.
proper, but denied the hypnotism arid
chloroforming and declared' that she
had inveigled him into the double be
trayal of Mr. Baxter's :trust. The plea
drew from the" bench a most scathing
arraignment of the doctor, "ingrate",
and /'adventurer" being among the
mildest terms applied to him. Then he
was pronounced -guilty of the threats
against life charge and further hearing
