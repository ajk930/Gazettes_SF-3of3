SAX RAFAEL, Aug. 26.â Dan Kelly
and .F. Â»W. Montague, two desperate
convicts, escaped from San Quentln
prison this afternoon, and up to a late
hour to-night no trace of . them had
been found.
The two escapes had been employed
for the last few. months in driving the
garbage wagons from the prison to the
hog ranch, a Quarter of a mile distant.
Montague. left the prison about 1 n.
m. to-day. with a load of garbage and
arrived at his destination fifteen min
utes later. . Kelly did not make a trip
and was supposed to be. working with
one of the prison gangs. The two men
were in the habit of spending about an
hour at the ranch, and the guard evi
dently paid little attention to Mon
tague's absence. A few hours later the
guard discovered the garbage wagon at
the ranch and Montague missing.
The officials at the, prison were noti
lied cf the escape and .all. available
guards were detailed to scour the hills.

Taylor of Marin County were notified
and the Saus'alito ferry-boats watched.
At T> p. ni., lock-up time. Kelly. Mon

day with cheers for" Roosevelt and
thanks to Santa Cruz. The delegates
were at no time yesterday or to-day
wearied by long speeches. The talks
were brief, pointed and patriotic. The
remarks of John F. Davis of Amador
in seconding the nomination of U. S.

thusiasm. ' , ," . :
George A.' Knight,' national commit
tecman from California, was greeted
with cordial enthusiasm and his speech
of acknowledgment was cheered.
Frank P. Flint and Henry T. Oxnard,
candidates for the United States Sen
ate, did not address the convention,
but they lost nothing in point of pres
tige by reason of their silence, for
George A. Knight made no reference
whatever to the Senatorial campaign in
his remarks.
Comment is made by delegates and
spectators belonging to the Republican
party that Mr. Oxnard was placed in
an unfortunate position ..yesterday, by
the blunders of his political managers.
It is remarked that one of his three
managers. ' Walter Bacon of Los
Angeles, should be absolved from all
blame for the unfortunate incident, as
he took no part in the proceedings to
place the candidate for United States
Senator in the contest for Presidential
elector to represent the Eighth District.'
Charles M. Hammond of Upper Lake,
Lake County, candidate ' for Presi

HERMOSILLO. Mexico, Aug. 26.â
Determined to break up, if possible, the
uprising of Yaoui Indians, which was
geming headway in 'the vicinity of
Hermosillo, the capital of Sonora, Gov
ernor Rafael Ysabel, commanding the
Federal forces in the absence of Gen
eral Luis E. Torres, who is visiting in
the United States, concentrated all of
the Oovernment ahd State troops/ with
the exception of small detachments
left to guard the ranches and roods
north of Guaymas, and ordered a gen
eral roundup of all Yaqui laborers, or
tame Indians, and all broncos within a
radius of fifty miles from Hermosillo.
The Indians -employed on the ranches
were^ not excluded, and when, on
Thursday, the movement was com
pleted, 400 Yaquis had been gathered in
the military prison.
Seventeen of the prisoners examined
by the Governor himself implicated
fifty others in crimes recently com
mitted. As a result of the preliminary
hearing, Domingo Bajeca, who led al
most all of the recent assaults; Antonio
Valencia, who had supervision over the
Indians on El Realito ranch and pro
vided a storehouse for arms and am
munition; Jose Alvarez, employed at
the Munoz ranch, at whose house the
Indians met and planned the revolt,
and Jose Buitemea, another . con
spirator, were condemned to death and
immediately shot. Others of the
IndiRns will receive the death sentence
if they can be proved guilty of the
crimes with which they are charged.
Governor Ysabcl has not yet decided
the fate of the many prisoners who re
main, but it is probable that, notwith
standing the protest of some of the
ranchers who depend on their labor," all
A'ill be deported to. Yucatan.

The rain fell in torrents at 4_ o'clock,
but it did not stop the fighting and late
in the evening several Russian com
panies moved forward to the attack.
It Is not yet possible to state posi
tively the result of the battle, but it la
asserted that the Russians were suc
cessful. There is prospect of more
fighting to-morrow.
At 2 o'clock the artillery fire became
as hot as it was at Vafangow, but it
fluctuated considerably and occasion
ally the Russian fire almost silenced
that of the Japanese.
KANTZERTUX (seven miles south
east of Liaoyang), Aug. 25.â Contrary
to the expectation of the Russians, the
Japanese are beginning to advance
along the whole line of the Russian
eastern front. On the morning of
August 24 there was a rifle skirmish
and the next day the Japanese artil
lery opened fire. On both days the
firing ceased at dusk and the small
energy displayed by the Japanese mil
itary was taken to indicate that it was
merely a demonstration or a recon
naissance in force. On the morning of
August 26, however, the rifle and ar
tillery fire was renewed with an energy
that left no doubt that a severe batil*
was intended.
The Japanese pushed their attack
against the Russian right flank and
center, concentrating their flre on the
First Battery of the Third Brigade.
Three officers and several men were
wounded early in the day. but the bat
tery held its position and replied to
the Japanese fire with such marked ef
fect that General Ivanof! (who com
mands the late General Keller's corps)
sent a congratulatory message to its
commander.
The Japanese several times at
tempted to cross the Tankih (Link*
River, but only a few succeeded and
these were forced to hide in the fleld3

Some time after they had departed
Earl succeeded in freeing himself of
the fetters which bound him and, rid
ing madly to the round-up camp, told
his story- Drue Wilson headed a posse
of six men. who followed the trail of
the outlaws to the Blue River, where
they were overtaken about dusk on
Thursday evening. In the fight which
followed the posse was handicapped by
fear of killing the boy, but the out
laws, outnumbered and hampered by
their captive, finally abandoned the
child, dropping him on the trail as
they fled.
The posse camped on the scene of
the fight, expecting to take up the trail
the next morning, but a heavy rain
fell in the night, completely obliterat
ing all trace of the outlaws.
SAFFORD. Ariz.. Aug. 26.â A cow- j
boy. who comes in once a week for mail j
for the Black Rock Ranch, in the Gila i
Mountains, reached Safford to-day with I
nefc 6 of the kidnaping of Thomas War- !
dell, a twelve-year-old boy. on the '
Black Rock Ranch, and his subsequent !
recoverj'. after a fight with bandits.
â¢ The foreman of the ranch and his j
cowboys were out on the round-up, !
wjth the exception of John Earl, left
in charge of the ranch, and the War
dell boy, a son of one of the men.
Shortly after nightfall on Wednesday
tfcrÂ«Â«'*4URi, whom Earl tlid not recog- j
nize. rode into the corral around the J
house and, dismounting, raised their j
rifles and ordered Earl's hands up. He
succeeded in slipping inside of the door i
and barricaded it. The outlaws, how- i
ever poured such a hot fire after Earl i
that in a few minutes the door was t
no more than a sieve and after making j
a feeble effort to return the fire the Â¦
Yanch house capitulated and the out- 1
laws took possession. Earl was tied j
hand and foot and the place searched, j
but nothing valuable was discovered. â¢
One of the outlaws then suggested the j
carrying off of the frightened child, to '

AID OF PARISH FAIR
Preceding the vote oh the question
of the permanent, headquarters there
was a love feast among the delegates
from Salt Lake and Denver, each dele
gate expressing, great regret over the
unhappy occurrence of. yesterday aft
ernoon, when uncomplimentary words
were bandied from one delegation to
the other because of the fact that -the
Mormon question had been interjected
into the debate for the permanent
headquarters." Â¦'.-Â¦â¢Â¦'. â¢ ; â¢
The olive branch was first extended
by Judge C. W. Powers of Salt Lake,
who in a few words expressed regret
for any hasty words he had used in
his address yesterday afternoon. Lafe
Pence of Lewiston, Idaho; who was
the chief speaker for the Denver dele
gation yesterday, accepted the token
of peace from Judge Powers, and in' a
straightforward manner impressed
upon his hearers the extent of his re
gret for having said things, though un
intentionally, that had created ill feel
ing among the delegations. The dove
of peace having extended its wings
over the proceedings, the question :of
the permanent headquarters, was de
bated pro and con with the result that
Denver carried oft the palm by a good
majority, which, upon motion of Judge
Powers, was made unanimous. ' â¢ â¢ '
A feature of the afternoon session
was the election of Joseph T. Corn
forth of -Alaska as an honorary life
member of the congress. The honor
was a token of appreciation of Corn
forth's services to the mining industry
in that he was one of the founders of
the American Mining Congress and has
given it substantial and valuable as
sistance In its growth since.
When the congress reconvened -at

Help came from the powerhouse and
" the party searched three hours before
" it found the body of Carpenter, which
eventually appeared on the opposite
side of the lake.
That Carpenter should have been at
tacked by a cramp and sink was a
' surprise to all. but how Miss Dowie
saved herself is a still greater cause
fnr wonder. MCTta
Deputy Coroner W. A. Bean left to
' day for the scene.
Carpenter was an expert swimmer
and during the summer, when outing
parties stop at the powerhouse for a
few days on their trip, the principal
'pport is swimming in the lake at the
head of the reservoir. Carpenter al
ways volunteered his services and was
such a trusted man in the water that
â¢ rone feared to go Into deep water with
him.
Miss Dowie, another young lady and
' George Marty were enjoying the cool
Â¦waters, the girls taking lessons from
Carpenter. He and Miss Dowie were
out in the deep water when Carpenter

Senator Hoar's Xote-
In Washington one day Senator
Hoar met an acquaintance who
stopped to inform him that a very
dear friend was seriously ill with ap
pendicitis. Senator Hoar was very
solieitious and determined to write a
note of sympathy at once. He had
hardly finished the note before word
came to him that his friend was ill
with acute indigestion instead of ap
pendicitis. Senator Hoar tore up the
first note and sent the following in
its place: "I am very sorrv to hear
tiiat you are ill, but am glad that the
trouble is with the table of contents
rather than with the appendix." â Ex

Nature sometimes saves a woman the
trouble of making a fool of a man.

Thousands followed the remains of
Peter J. Dunne to their last resting
place at Holy Cross Cemetery yester
day. St. Brigld's Church, where the
solemn rites were held, was crowded.
While the reauiem high mass was be
ing sung belated mourners arrived and
crowded the street in front of the edi
fice.
There were men from all walks of
life, but they were united in this, they
had all known and liked Peter J.
Dunne and were grieved over his un
timely death. Politicians, policemen,
lawyers, doctors, newspaper men and
laborers stood side by side and bared
their heads as the coffin wasioorne by.
They furnished a touching proof of
Captain Dunne's power to make and
keep friends.
â¢ 'In the crowd were four Chinamen
who had been employed by the Dunne
Brothers. Their faces were full of sor
row.
The pall bearers were Garret W. Mc-
Enerney, William H. Leahy. J. F. Sul
livan, James E. Britt, Michael Asey,
H. T. Creswell, Percy V. Long, Josiah
R. Howell, James Shay and Joseph
Loewe. '
The funeral procession left the late
captain's residence. 1322 Leavenworth
street, at 10 o'clock. It was preceded
by%a procession farmed of members
of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, Ig
natian Council, Y. M. I., the Iroquois
Club and the Knights of St. Patrick.
The carriages following the hearse
formed a train that reached for five
blocks
At St. Brigld's' Church the requiem
high mass was sung by Rev. Father
Cottle, assisted by Father McAullffe.
After the services the remains were
conveyed to Holy Cross Cemetery on
a funeral car. There the remains of
one of the best liked men in the city
were laid to rest. j^H
One incident broke rudely into the
solemnity of the occasion. A dispute
; arose between the union and non-union
hackmen as the funeral procession left
the dead man's residence. For the sake
of peace the non-union hackmen agreed
to drive to the church on ' a different
street. On the way to the funeral car
the non-union men drove in the rear
of the others.

NEW YORK, Aug. 26.â Bradstreet to
morrow will say: Rather better west
ern crop reports and the advance of
the fall season have brought an in
creased number of buyers to nearly all
western and eastern markets. This has
resulted in an enlargement of fall dis
tributions, which, however, have pro
ceeded along conservative lines, with
staple products, notably In best de
mand. A feature of the week through
out the country has been clearance
sales of summer goods bv retailers
which have enlarged distribution in
this line, no doubt to be later on re
flected In collections. Industrial re
sumptions are numerous and the num
ber of operatives involved is consider
able. The labor situation is still rather
complex, a large number of additional
building hands striking in New York.
A rather better .tone is noted in tex
tile circles, the effect of a numerous
resumption of cotton mills and the
disposition to take hold shown by buy
ers of textiles at first and second
hands. What few railroad earnings are
available point to slight gains over the
corresponding month a year ago.
Raw wool is rather in better demand
j and firm, with scoured wools strong.
Lumber is fairly active at the North
west, but rather quiet at the East,
where building trade troubles affect
distribution.

MONTPELIER, Vt., Aug. 26.âSecre
tary of War Taft addressed a Republi
can rally in Armory Hall this [ after
noon. Secretary Taft briefly reviewed
the issues and history of the parties
and discussed their platforms. He
eulogized the President highly, say
ing:
Unable really to attack the record of the
Republican party, unable really to take, any
ground which makes a combaiable Issue with,
the Republicans on the main question, the
Democrats now seek to attack the President
and to charge him with violations of the con
stitution, with a Headstrong disposition to rule
or ruin, with a tendency to Involve the coun
try In foreign wars, with beinfe. In other
words, an unsafe man. In all my experience
I never have met a man In authority who has
less uride ofioplnlon tn the Judgments that he
has formed In respect to situations presented
to htm for action than has Theodore Roose
velt. I have never met a man who was so
amenable to reason, so anxious to reach a just
conclusicn and eo willing to sacrifice a pre
viously formed opinion as the present Presi
dent of the United States. He weiths every
argument which is brouuht before htm, and if
by reason of the limpid character of his
nature, wrlch leads him to speak as he thinks,
he gives instant expression to an opinion which
subsequent facts show him to be erroneous, he
changes as only a man can change who 1$
an earnest seeker for truth, wlth'tho sincerest
desire to do rlsht. , -
He iÂ« not a tyrant, but he is a leader. He
does believe in a. strenuous life. He does be
lieve In doing thinus. He believes that a man
who 'is Eivei. brain and muscle is charged
with the responsibility of making the most of
them and of doing as much with both as
possible for his fellow men. He represents
as high a type as there- is in the country of
energetic American manhood.
No man ever Fat In the Presidential chair
more anxious to avoid war or conflict with
foreign nations than he. His lmpulslvenesn
of manner and his quickness of thoueht and
speech co-exist with a real conservatism of
action that makes it as certain as it was under
Mr. McKinley that no policy will be followed
n-eedlessly exposing tl^e interests of the coun
try to the peril, ot war.
/Ah. but It is said wait until he has a free
hand after the election, then you'; will see
him in his true light. It is difficult to answer
such a sratuitous suggestlcn, founded as It
must be on the assumption, that a man like
Theodore Roosevelt, whose candor and honesty
are so patent that he almost thinks aloud, has
been playing: a Dart for threre yam and is only
awaiting the success at election to throw off
the mask. It Is too ridiculous for discussion.

LAST TRIBUTE
this afternoon, and the nominee has
the ability and resources for a vigor
ous campaign on his own behal'f. Re
cent political events have signified his
popularity In Santa- Clara County and
he will surely hold the full measure of
the party strength In San Mateo
County.
The nomination of Duncan E. Mc-
Kinlay for Congress in the Second Dis
trict is highly commended. He deserves
the support of every Republican in the
district on ' account of the excellent
service that he has rendered to the
people of California in general and the
Republican party In particular. The
citizens of Sacramento County are
elated over his nomination, as they
comprehend that his vigorous intellect
and persuasive personality will enable
him to accomplish something in Con
gress for the benefit of the Sacramento
Valley. It is remarked that the only
legislation obtained by the J present
Democratic Representative of the Sec
ond District was an amendment abol
ishing the canteen at the Veterans'
Home. Every county of the Second
District was fully and ably represented
In the Republican Congressional Con
vention that nominated' Duncan Mc-
Kinlay. In the Democratic Congress
ional Convention of the Second held
here lastf Tuesday the county of Marin
was not represented at all and only
a few delegates from other counties
attended. As conclusive proof that the
Democratic Convention of the Second
District was a small affair the fact
is cited that it was held in the ladles'
parlor of the St. George Hotel, Santa
C.ruz.
Nearly all the delegates to the Re
publican State Convention and all the

Santa Clara Man Choice of the Fifth
â¢ v Congressional District.
SANTA CRUZ, Aug. 26.â The dele
gates from the Fifth Congressional
District assembled to-day immediately
after the adjournment of the State
convention and unanimously nomi
nated K. A. Hayes of San Jose for
Congtesa. The choice of the delega
tion being without opposition, the sec
retary was Instructed to cast the vote
of the convention for the Santa Clara
man.
James R. Lowe of San Jose acted
as chairman of the convention a vV
George C. Ross of Redwood City was
chosen secretary. The nominating and
seconding speeches were brief and to
the point. Loud cheers were given
when Hayes arose in response to
the calls of the delegates to make a
speech.
"Gentlemenâ I know that you will
give me your support," said Hayes,
"and feel confident that we can re
deem the Fifth District from the hands
of the "Democratic party. As long as
I have your support and the support
of my fellow Republicans of the Fifth
I know it will be plain sailing. I don't
want to tell you all the good things
I will do, bnt I will promise to uphold
the principles of the- great party and
work for the betterment of the people
of our district."
The employes of the San Jose Her
ald and Mercury immediately sent a
congratulatory telegram to Hayes, ex
pressing to him their heartfelt wishes
at his good fortune. The telegram was
as follows:
"E.'A. Hayes, Sea Beach Hotel, Santa
Cruz: Congratulations to our next
Congressman, with affectionate wishes
and loyal support of 150 of the. hap
piest employes in California,"
SANTA CRUZ, Aug. 26.â Time adds
to the snarl in the Twenty-ninth Sen
atorial District. When the district cen
vention met this morning it was an
ticipated that the clashing Interests
would be harmonized. But the Santa
Cruz County Central Committee, dis
satisfied with the outlook and antici
pating such a contingency, took snap
action from which "was born a dizzy
legal tangle. As a result S. H. Rambo
and Christian Hoffman, both of this
city, hold certificates of nomination for
State Senator, but which will be recog
nized by the Secretary of State is a
question.
Under the call of the State Central
Committee for the State Convention a
clause was Inserted in which it was
stated that thecounty delegates to the
State Convention would constitute the
various Legislative conventions unless
the county committees of the various
counties composing the several Assem
bly and Senatorial districts had taken
legal action for the constitution of sep
arate Legislative conventions. Action
for such separate conventions â¢ the
Santa Cruz Central Committee claimed
it had taken. Chairman Stone of the
State Central Committee claimed that
the county committee had not taken
6uch action and ordered that the dele
gates to the State convention from San
Mateo and Santa Cruz counties*, which
compose the Twenty-ninth Senatorial
District, meet this morning and nomin
ate a candidate for Senator.
The delegates from the two counties
named met in the Casino this morn
ing, but the Hoffman faction of the
Santa Cruz delegation refused to recog
nize the legality of the meeting as
composed of the delegates to the State
convention and presented a list of nine i
other delegates selected this morning
by the County Central Committee of
Santa Cruz, which the county commit
tee said were properly accredited to'
the Senatorial convention. These nine
men are L. .". Dake, 'George Radeliff,
Harry S. Wanzer, Harry Lucas, W. C.
Hoffman, H. F. Fanneuf, S. A. Palmer,
A. G. Lay and H. F. Kron.
The Rambo faction of the Santa Cruz
delegation refused to; recognize these
ninr, as did the seven delegates from
San Mateo, which favored Henry "Ward
Brown for Sen or. The Bror/n and
Rambo delegates then assembled and
elected George Ross of Redwood chair-,
man of the convention. The San Mateo
delegation" cast Its seven votes for
Brown and the Rambo faction of the
Santa Cruz delegation four votes for
Rambo. Brown, however, stated that
as one half of the delegates of the two
counties ionstltutlnp the district had
not cast "heir vote for him he could
not consider that he had been nomin
ated. Therefore, he refused to accept
a certificate from the seven delegates
of San Mateo, .constituting a" majority
of the convention as held, a Â§eeon<3
ballot was taken In which Brov. a again
received seven votes, but again he de
clined to consider that his nomination
had been effected. Upon the third bal
lot the San Mateo delegation bolted to
Rambo and he was declared the nom
inee.
While this was foingr on the r.!ns
delegates appointed by the Santa Cruz
County Committee assembled in anoth
er part of the hall, elected Dake chrir
man and proceeded to organize a Sen
atorial disirlct convention of its o*n.
Nominations were called for and the
nine cast their vote for Christian HofJ
man of Santa Cruz. The nominees of
the two conventions will now make a
race to get their certificates to the of
fice of the Secretary of State. In tin
meanwhile the Secretary of State will
be apprised of the situation and upon
his Judgment will rest the fate of the
opposing nominees. ' -;â¢ .

commend the effort how being made to re-establish
in, a* ;modern way the road known as El Camino
Real. ' : j-' :: Â£ \^X' i i
- \Ve> congratulate the country, upon the passage of
the national Irrigation act, a measure recom
mended : by a Republican j President and enacted
by a Republican Congress.
We pledge our nominees for Congress, to: the
earnest advocacy. and consistent* support. of meas
ures now -pending and to be offered- -'designed for
the Improvement of the rivers and harbors of the
State.- ....â,,.,-.â¢-.... ............... ,
We commend the efforts that are being made by
the National and State' Governments to promote
the mining industries of the. State without detri
ment to the agricultural and other interests in
volved. .
We approve and advocate the adoption of the
prdf>osed constitutional amendment providing- for
the establishment of District Courts of Appeal.
Owing to the rapid growth of the State nnd the
consequent increase, of litigation, the business of
the Supreme Court has become greater than that
court can dispose of. Tills causes unavoidable de
lay,, to the gr.mt injury of litigants, and prevents
the prompt administration of criminal justice.
This* plan is in successful operation in the national
system and in other States. The amendment aboi-
Ishe^ the [present Supreme Court Commission, and
the change will not materially increase the expense
of maintaining the judicial system, while *it will
.very materially cxpedtie the business of the courts.
We recommend the adoption. of the proposed con
stitutional amendment empowering the Legislature
to revise the codes by a single act, and the further
proposed amendment designed to exempt from tax
ation 'household furniture to- the value of $100.
We oppose tlic adoption of Senate constitutional
' amendment No. 20, known as the San ford amend
ment, extendinr the session of the Legislature fi-om
sixty to eighty days, and* providing a private sec
retary for each member.
We favor the adoption of the proposal sub
mitted by tlic Legislature to the people to Issue
State bonds to the* amount of $2,000,000 for the
improvement of the San Francisco water front,
known as the San Francisco seawall act. The in
creasing commerce of the "Pacine#imperatively de
mands better Inrbor accommodations on the coast.
This measure will not entail any tax upon the peo
ple of the State, as the entire expenditure is to be
borne by the State harbor fund. '
In conclusion we, the delegated representatives
of the Republi?an party of California, an integral
portion of the great National Republican party,
appeal upon this platform to the electors of the
State. We especially address ourselves to the
young citizens who will this year cast their first vote.
The ranks of the older generation who have voted
with the party are' unbroken; we wish to enlist
the young men. j To the first voters of our State we
say. wiillc our party has a glorious past, it does not
live in the past: it is the party of the future.
Align yourselves with the iwirty that stands for the
national idea, that has always stood for sound
money and honest finances and that Is pledged by
Its history to t he policy of protection.
We pledge the nominees of the party for the
Senate and Assembly to strict economy, and to a
careful and persistent effort to avoid and prevent
extravagance and waste in,. the disposition of the
public funds.
The Republican party stands pledged. now as In
the past to lib?ral appropriations for the support
and maintenan ?e of the public schools and the
State University.
Recognizing the great importance of the farming,
horticultural, stock and dairy interests of our State,
and convinced that th'e work of the agricultural
department of our State University will be of great
and lasting benefit to those interests, we recom
mend that the Legislature provide a suitable appro
priation for the purchase of an experimental farm
for the use of the agricultural department of the
University of. California.
We fully recognize that good roads tend to the
well-being and prosperity of the State, nnd we
urge the improvement of our public highways and
With nil those who believe' that the executive
head of the National Government should be en
trusted to men endowed with force, energy and
determination, and not to the mere instruments of
a political party, we rejoice that the choice of the
Republican party has fallen upon Theodore Roose
velt for President and Charles W. Fairbanks for
Vice President. Their lives and careers show their
entire fitness for the high offices for which they
have been nominated. Possessed of courage, en
dowed with ability, trained In statesmanship, ever
ready to assume a positive stand on all national
Questions; and to declare their views without hesi
tation, the can lldates of the Republican party can
justly claim t:r-* confidence rfhd support of the
American people.
We commend the . course of our Senators and
Republican ""Representatives in the' Congress .of .the
United States, and we are especially gratified In
the merited promotion of the Hon. Victor II. Met
calf to a position in the Cabinet.
We heartily commend the present State admin

C. Pardee.
.the Republican party has no past which it
wants . forgotten. It dories in its record, and in
the statesmen and soldiers, livlnjr and dead, who
made it.

The people of v California find in the national

DR. PIERCE'S REMEDIED.
It is much easier for a woman to coaSde
ia the average man than ia the average
woman. She knows that the man will re-
spect her confidences and keep them to
hraself. He is strong:, has more experience
of the world and can help the woman who
needs advice. There is every reason why
women should not trust their delicate
constitutions in the hands of unskilled
persons. It requires a thorough medical
education to appreciate and understand
the womanly organism. When a woman
has ills and pains that she cannot bear
â when life seems dark for every woman,
she should confide her troubles to a
physician of standing in the community,
or one who has a national reputation. â¢ Cer-
tainly it would not be the part of wisdom
to confide in an ignorant person â¢without
medical education simply because she was
a woman. There is every reason why she
should write to some great specialist, one
who has made the diseases of women a
specialty for a third of a century, like Dr.
R. V. Pierce, founder of the Invalids' Hotel
and Surgical Institute, of Buffalo. N. V

fidential, and he gives his advice free aa<i

legal action against Thomas B. Wa.g
gamann, treasurer of the Catholic Uni
versity, against whom bankruptcy
proceedings were Instituted to prevent
his making the university a preferred
creditor, was taken to-day when a
number of citizens of Maryland filed

The complainants allege that they at
various times placed In Waggamann's
hands certain money for Investment

caused him to become, as to each of
the complainants, a trustee, and that
he was bound to hold the notes for

NEW YORK, Aug. 26.â The an
nouncement that the American Steel
and Wire Company of the United
States Steel Corporation will ship 500
carloads of wire products over the
Union Pacific Railroad at a cut freight
rate of 41*4 per cent Â¦ to carry on a
war against the Colorado Fuel and
Iron Company means aggressive re
taliatory movements at other points.
George J. Gould is at the head of
the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company.
As soon as the invasion of that com
pany's territory by the United States
Steel Corporation was made possible
by the Union Pacific's cutting of
freight rates from Chicago to Colo
rado the Gould lines came to-the res
cue of the Colorado Fuel and Iron
Company by announcing that they
would make corresponding reductions
in rates from Pueblo and other Colo
rado points to Missouri River points.
The Union Pacific and other Harri
iflan lines joined in the crusade of the
United States Steel Corporation against
the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company,
because that company, being controlled
by the Gould interests, naturally gave
all its competitive business to the
Gould railroads. So far the fight i3
confined to the Jollet plant of the
American Steel and Wire Company and
the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company's
plant at Pueblo, but this fight in
volves all the railroads from Chicago
to Ogden. If the other plants of the
steel trust become involved the other
railroads will too.

DEL MONTE, Aug. 26.â The first day
of the race meet of the Automobile
Club of California, held on the Del
Monte track, passed off most success
fully. A large and fashionable assem
blage witnessed the events, which were
run without mishap of any kind. The
day was warm and bright and the
spectators were enthusiastic.
The first pursuit race was without
much interest, as the spectators did
not quite understand" it, but the second
one excited much closer and more in
telligent attention. The non-appearance
of Frank A. Garbutfs racing car in
the third race caused disappointment,
the clutch not working properly. This
clever operator,^ however, appeared in
the first heat for the Del Monte cup.
but was beaten after a most exciting
contest by a Pope-Toledo car. Two of
the eight races run off during the day
took place in the morning. The other
six events, several of which required
two preliminary heats and a final heat,
began at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
The track was in fine condition and
fast time was made.
The fastest mile of the day was
made by a Pope-Toledo in the second
heat for the Del Monte cup, George
P. Fuller, owner and operator, cover
ing the distance in 1:03%. The final
heat for the Del Monte cup will take
place to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock
between a Pope-Toledo car, driven by
F. J. Swentzel, and a car of the same
make operated by George P. Fuller.
; DETAILS OF THE RACES.
HOTEL DEL MONTE, Aug. 26.â The
annual rodeo of the smart set at Del
Monte o'pened to-day with a zip. The
dispenser of weather did the right thing
and the race track looked like a seg
ment of Saratoga. If there's a mobllist
le.'t In San Francisco let him admit it â
he'll surely lose caste. Socially all the
"ins" are here, likewise those who
merely get a "look-in"; also the "outs,"
and the "outs" are paying cheerfully
for the privilege, of staring at the
"ins" and rubbing elbows with them.
Style? Yes, there are some stunning
â¢women here. There's Mrs. R. P.
Sehwerln, the Taylors, Miss Grace
Spreckels. Miss Ethel Hager, Miss
Pearl Landers and a few others. Hut
I have never seen such an aggregation
of fat women â and so many thin men â
for which, of course, there must be
some economic or physical reason. But
Gibson ha3 told that story with his
pencil.
To-day the dining-room doors were
announced to open at 1:30, but by 1:13
every maid and matron on the "assem
bly" invitation list was lined up at the
barricade that barred them from their
luncheon, elbov.ing her pretty way
"up close." I have seen dining-room
doors rushed beforeâ but they were
over on the Potrero. f
When the doors finally yielded the
fair influx looked like the Rosebud set
tlement rush. Among those who are
now within sight on the hotel veranda
to-night are: Ned Greenway, round as

Captain Hitch testified that the plans
of the mob had been so carefully laid
that not even a regiment of soldiers
could successfully have resisted them.
He told of having before participated
in riot duty and of having observed the
moral effect upon a crowd of the com
mand "load guns."
This command he had intended to
give at the proper time, but Just be
fore that time, in his opinion, was
reached, he was seized by a deputy
sheriff and thrown downstairs to the
mob, which promptly disarmed him.
The soldiers, not having any loads in
their rifles, were soon overcome and
the mob completed its murderous work
unmolested. He said he had no inti
mation of the purpose of the mob to
seize and lynch the negroes as soon as
they were convicted.
Captain Hitch and non-commissioned
officers and privates testified to the
collusion of the Sheriff and some of
the deputies with the mob. Some of
the Eoldiers swore that Sheriff Ken
drick had himself opened the door of
the guardroom and pointed out the
prisoners to the mob, which', was hard
on his' heels.
Henry Hodges and family. Militiamen
also told the court of inquiry appointed
by Governor Terrell that the Sheriff
and his deputies aided the lynchers.
The two sergeants on duty at the
cell of the negroes testified that the
Sheriff told them to turn over the pris
oners to the mob, as he had seen Cap
tain Hitch and had been instructed by
the captain to let the mob have the
men.
SAVANNAH, Ga., Aug. 25.âDepen
dence on the order "load guns" to
quell a mob rather than on the effi
ciency of bullets to accomplish the
eaxne purpose was a reason given to
day by Captain Hitch of the Georgia
National Guard for his failure to pre
vent the murder by burning at the
stake of Will Cato and Paul Reed,
negroes convicted of the murder of

to Load Guns Would Quell

The salarv roll could be swelled to
advantage by employing some well
posted men to explain to visitors what
they are looking at in the exhibit build

thoroughly exploited, but there is no

FRESNO, Aug. 26.â The women of
Fresno who wish to free themselves
from marriage vows seem to have en
teredinto an agreement to boycott the
lawyers' union. Encouraged by the
success of Mrs. Mary E. Cook, who ob
tained her divorce without a lawyer, a
couple of weeks ago, Mrs. Almeda M.

J. M. Grey r who lives at Byron.
Mrs. Grey owns a grocery at 1362 F
street. As grounds f or h er suit sno a! _
leges failure to provide. She says that
whisky has ruined her home and her
husband has never looked after her as
he should.
Mrs. Grey has gone a step farther
than Mrs. Cook, who had previously ob
tained a divorce and from the same
man. All Mrs. Cook had to do was to
change the dates on her complaint.
But Mrs. Grey had to make her own
complaint. She went to a lawyer, who
told her the charge would be $50. She
borrowed a copy of a complaint from
a friend who had obtained a divorce on
the same ground she wished to allege,
and with this for a sample she to-day
riled her papers.

SUCCESS OF THE TURBINA
PLEASES NAVAL ENGINEERS
Kxpcrinicntal Craft Is Regarded as
Highly Satisfactory in
Every Way.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 26.â A board of
naval engineering experts has just
completed a thorough examination of
the Turbina, one of the latest devel
opments in the use of the steam tur
bine, as applied to vessels. The results
of the inspection will be made known
in detail in a report on the subject of
turbine power which the board will pre
pare, but it may be said the perform
ance of the Turbina was regarded as
highly satisfactory in , the complete
absence of vibration and in the com
fort of the crew.
Furthermore, almost no more repairs
are necessarv to the engine, there be
ing no friction except in a few bear-
Ings. There is no pounding and thud
ding of enginesâ nothing but a soft
rush of steam through the pipes so that
noise is suppressedâ a valuable consid
eration in naval combats. The engine
room force is largely reduced. Addi
tional coal carrying capacity is gained
by the reduction of weight of the en
gines and the center of gravity is low
ered through the motors being placed
just above the keel. . Â» "
Now that a.* practical reversing de
vice has been found and Installed in
this boat the naval engineers are pre
pared to press forward the completion
of their plans for the installation of
turbines on the new warships.
tory over Louis Burns. The boys went
four rounds, and the bout abounded in
a lot of willingness, even though the
real science of the game was lacking.
Saglnaw was game, and that was what
got him the purse. He started off like
a quarter horse in the first round, but
fared rather badly for two rounds. He
finally began to wear his man down,
and floored him several times in the
last two rounds, winning the fight by
an ample margin.
Jack Means and Billy Sullivan, two
130-poundfere, mixed it in the second
preliminary. Means showed great form
in the close places and was cool and
collected throughout. He was a little
to the bad in the game of lead, and
it was here that Sullivan had the better
of the go and also had his man in dan
ger a couple of times.
Means did his best work In the first
two rounds. Every time Sullivan came
at him he sent in "rights and lefts in
quick succession and had Sullivan
wabbly on several occasions. The last
round was about even up, but as Sul
livan had done all the effective work
Referee Frank Corillo gave him the
decision.
Following is the report of the fight
by rounds:
Round 1 â Both advanced slowly to
the center and indulged in light spar
ring. Munroe was the first to lead,
this with" a left that was short. Jeff
ries danced around his opponent, drew
him into a clinch and missed a right
for the body. Munroe. In a clinch,
missed a right for the body. Jeffries
was chewing gum and smiling. Jeff
ries sent Munroe to the floor with a
left hook to the jaw. Munroe was up
quickly, but the champion drove a
straight right to the head and followed
it with a left swing to the stomach.
Jeffries followed his advantage, driv
ing Munroe to the ropes with right
and left to the body. A well directed
left to the jaw sent Munroe to the floor
for eight seconds. He arose, but again
was floored with a similar blow. Jeff
ries started a vicious right for the Jaw,
but the bell rang and the champion
stayed its progress. Munroe did not
land a blow and looked nearly out as
his seconds shoved him to his corner.
â¢ Round 2 â They went to a clinch.
Munroe received a left swing to the
mouth that made him spit blood. He
bored in, but Jeffries was unrelenting,
smashing him all over the body with
left and right.- He floored the miner.
Blood flowed from Munroe's face and
mouth. Another terrific right to the
face rendered the miner helpless. He
sank slowly to the floor and attempted
to rise. Jeffries was waiting for him,
but before the champion could land on
his helpless victim Rereree Graney
grabbed him and declared Jeffries the
winner.
BETTORS FAVOR JEFFRIES.
Make Him a Strong Choice Through
out All the Wagering.
Jeffries ruled a strong favorite from
first to last in the wagering on the
fight. The first tickets -written showed
Jeffries a 3Va to 10 choice.
This was the prevailing price tip to
yesterday, when the pressure of Jef
fries money sent the price down to
3 to 10. Jeffries' admirers were all In
the heavy-weight class, sending In
their checks for thousands.
To offset this flood of money the
men who figured Munroe to have a
chance sent in their commissions In
fives and tens and It was slow work to
absorb the Jeffries money.
The liveliest betting wu on tlia
probable number of rounds tha con
test would last. Jeffries' adherents
were confident he would win insJda of
ten rounds and freely offered erea
money on the proposition.
This price appealed to the Monro*
followers and they took up a lot of
money. The total sum for which
tickets were written was reminiscent
of the palmy days when every *n^n
had at least a small bet down on bis
favorite fighter.
McCoy Believes
Butte Miner Was
Fairly Subdued
"No. 1 ha\e no excuses (o of
fer," said Kid McCoy after the
battle. "Muni-oe might hate
made a better showing had he
gone after the champion in the
first round. As it. was, that first
punch in the stomach started
him going. We tried to revive
him at the end of the round,
but it was useless. I did not
throw up the sponge, for I
thought â¢ Munroe might still
make a stand. If he had suc
ceeded In hitting the big fellow
a few tunes he surely would
have showed the public that he
is capable of lighting. Munroe
Is not injured to any extent, for
he wi:s in splendid physical con
dition."
Jeffries Punches
His Opponent
at Will.
"This may be Jeff's last nglu."
said Billy Delaney. "He has
met and beaten them all, and
now I do not see whom they
can bring to the front. As far
as I- am concerned, I would like
him to retire on his laurels. If
lie has to wait for a couple of
years he may not be in such
good form. About the fight?
Well, I was disappointed. Mun
roe was hopelessly outclassed. I
knew that when I saw him
make the first pass. I know,
that Jeff hit harder to-night
than he ever did before in his
life and Munroe received some
punches tliat were something
terrible. No. we have no plans
for the future."
"Jeff May Retire
From Prize Ring,"
Says His Trainer
s f I STOPPED the fight because I feared Munroe might be killed:' He is too game a man to be injured
I .for life, nnd 1 am sure all fair minded persons will agree that I acted humanely. I appealed to Mc
Â¦ Coy to throw up the sponge, but he motioned a refusal' When Munroe arose in the second round I
knew he was helpless and I prevented a ring fatality; Jeffries Is bigger, faster and better than ever.
He improves in each fight. Nature lias been kind to the champion. He is too strong and hits too hard
for nny man. Jeffries landed the first punch and it vrtis a lucky one. After it landed Munroe was at sea
and was at the mercy of Jeffries. Jeffries had an easy victory because lie was up against a man who was
too slow anil ungainly. Munroe should not take his defeat to heart, as he was beaten by a champion of
champions." â Eddie M. Graney, referee, In an interview.
Referee Graney Says He Prevented a Ring Tragedy.
THE CHAMPION OF CHAMPIONS AND MOST FORMIDABLE FICSHTKR IN HISTORY OF RING.
It was a gala night at the Pavilion.
The great structure was filled with an
excited crowd that came to see Cham
pion James J. Jeffries do battle with
Jack Munroe. aspirant for heavy
weight honors. The crowd was expect
ant and anticipated a hot battle, but
it was sadly disappointed. The throng
departed with jeers for the vanquished
and praise for the boilermaker.
Many had traveled thousands of
miles to see a "championship battle,"
and ihe visitors will return to their
homes and tell what a "dub" Munroe
is and of his consummate nerve in
even fancying he aad a chance to wrest
the championship from the mighty
Jeffries.
It was a banner attendance, and
when the "gate receipts had been
counted it was noted that $21,500 had
been paid in by people anxious to see
the men perform. Of this sum the
fighters received CO per cent, amounting
to $13.0S0. Jeffries then gathered $7813
and Munroe accepted $5222 for his
beating. The Yosemite Athletic Club's
share was $8100.
Captain Mooney and Lieutenant
KÂ°lly handled the spectators in good
fashion. There was little crowdins and
no one was injured. The ticket-holders
got their seats without lighting for
them, and this reflected great credit on
th^ club and management.
As car)y,as 3 o'clock there was a long
line of men and boys camped along
the Grove-street side of the Pavilion.
They waited patiently until the doors
were thrown open. Each hour brought
more waiters, and by 6:30 p. m. the club
was assured of a big attendance in the
gallery. A line of rese. ved-seat holders
gathered in front of Mechanics' Pavil
ion, awaiting the opening of the main
entrance. Promptly at 7:30 p. m. the
ticket holders w ere allowed to enter,
Sling down two passage-ways without
crowding. The crowd was slow to ar
rive, but by the time the main event
was announced the structure was
crowded with spectators. The Pavilion
presented a gala appearance, due to
decorations being placed in the rafters
for the foi incoming visit of the
Knights Templar. â¢
One lone woman braved the eyes of
fightgoers and sat in the gallery with
htr escort. She took as deep an inter
est in thÂ» goes as any one present, and
her voice joined the mighty shouts
that greeted Jeffries on achieving his
easy victory.
PROMINENT MEN THERE.
Seated close to the ring were men
prominent in professional and business
life. Lawyers and doctors brushed
elbows with men who toil with their
hand?. Flasks of "inspiration" were
passed around in good fellowship. The
curling smoke from cigars mingled
with the "coffin-nail" puffed by the
youths in the gallery. While waiting
for Ihe "event of the evening" to come
off. the viritor from the country ex
changed views with his city friend. In
troductions were unnecessary and un
sought.
There was considerable betting at
the ringside, but these bets were made
on the theory that Jeffries would or
would not win In less than ten round3.
Lieutenant Kelly of the Police De
partment sat c!cse to the ring, await
ing developments. He also practiced
peering beneath the new military head
gear that has been introduced in police
circles. The peak of the cap had Kelly
blinded, but he did not fail to see that
Jeffries was hammering Munroe (to
pieces and had not Referee Graney
interfered would have . flopped the
unequal fight. Beside the officer sat
William P. Harlowe, formerly a lawyer
of Sacramento, but who is now a r.il
lionaire mine owner of Mexico. Mr.
Harlowe Journeyed from New York to
see the championship fight and does
not think he was repaid for the Ions
trip.
HORSES AND CARTS THERE.
The "Horses and Carts" and the
"Morgue Club" forgot all about De
mocracy In their eagerness to ,see the
"mill." The.McN'ab men were of the
opinion that the fight was just as easy
as the one they had "on the opening
night of the late municipal convention.
Here and there among the spectators
could be seen statesmen who had
twelve hours before made the walls of
the convention hall at Santa Cruz echo
with their eloquence.
Charles M. Shortridge forgot all
about his defeat for the Congressional
nomination. Senator Eddie Wolfe for
got his coming fight, but when it was
all over he turned to a friend and said,
"I hope I win my district as easy as
Jeff won to-night."
Senator Savage of Los Angeles
rubbed his glasses and watched the
gladiators intently. Judge Fritz could
not keep quiet during the mill. He
feinted and ducked with every blow
and whenever he saw an opening he
let fly with his elbow and his ste
nographer suffered. "Dick" Adams and
"Cute" Eddie Hanlon were close to the
ring to give Jeff confidence and other
things. "Sandy" Griswold came all the
way from Omaha to see the contest and
was rewarded by Billy Delar.ey, who
allowed him to hold the "bottle." Mike
Sheehan gazed at Munroe and won
dered if his porterhouse steaks had
given Jack sufficient strength to stand
off the boiler-maker.
SPECTATORS AMBITIOUS.
George Knight gazed at the big
crowd and wished that he could enter
the ring and make * rousing speech
for Roosevelt. Mose Gunst was also
among those present. Dr. D. F. Ragan.
Health Officer, thought the Pavilion
was in need of disinfection by reason
of the bad cigars that were being
puffed around him. Dr. Drucker sat
on a cane-bottomed chair and thought
it was as easy as pulling teeth.. Joe
Gottlob. Johnny Morrisey and other
well-known theatrical managers were
in the throng and sized up the house.
Colonel Kirkpatrick sat on the side ani
voiced the opinion that "Jeffries was a
cinch." Gus Messinger was on the point
of taking out a policy en Munroe's life,
but Bob Mitchell of ostrich fame ad
vised Gus not to do so, as Jeffries
was likely to kill Munroe. After the
fight Messinger thanked Mitchell for
the timely advice. Judge Hebbard for
got judicial matters and was ready to
render a decision in favor of Jeffrie3
at the end of the first round.
All the old faces so often seen at
pugilistic encounters were noted around
the ring. It was a typical fight crowd
and easily managed. There was no
disorder and everything passed off in
Sunday school fashion. The unequal
contest was over at 20 o'clock and the
disappointed devotees of the fistic game
slowly wended their way out of the
Pavilion and homeward. Many blame
Jeffries for not knocking Munroe out
in Butte, Mont., and thus saving them
from being enticed to the arena.
Should Munroe ever fight again a
corporal's guard would not turn out to
see him. The question that remains to
be answered is. "Who Is capable of
giving Jeffries a warming up?"
Jarnes J. Jeffries, the Goliath of the
prizenng and the undisputed cham
pion of all champions, disposed of Jack
Mur.roo'? pretensions last night in Me
chanics' Pavilion with ridiculous ease.
The end came with swift and terrible
action, after forty-five seconds of
tightinc in the fetcond round.
Munr'ie had b?*n knocked down re
jeatcily. and ts-n seconds had been
tolled o2 by Timekeeper George Hart
ing, which meant the end of the fi^ht.
Neither the boxers nor Refere? Graney
heart! this in the tumult about ihe
xing. Munroe was helpless, and the
referee appealed to his seconds to toss
a sponge into the ring, signaling de
fee V. Jutt then Jeffries drew back his
:ight hand to land the decisive blow.
Keferee Graney anticipated his action
iind. stepping between the rival boxers,
t-t'jpped the proceedings.
Had Jeffries landed on Munroe in
the lattcr'-j helpless condition it is
possible an-jthci tragedy would have
been recorded. Up to this time Jeffries'
blows had a!i been of the short, jolty
order an-1 they punished Munroe ter
ribly. What would have happened had
Jewries put a'-l the force of his power
ful muscles behind a blow is easy jo
conjecture. The recipient would not
have been able to discuss subsequent
events.
Munroe was a defeated man when he
stepped tato the ring. He had lost all
the- boyish buoyancy â¢ which he -dis
played during the months he has been
ia training here and looked white and
hasrgard. lie peered furtively at Jef
fries, who was partly screened from
his view by the seconds in the rin?.
V.'hat he taw did not relieve his anx
iety.
JEFFRIES' GRAND FORM.
Jeffries wag the most perfect type of
fighter that ever stepped into the ring.
He seemed unusually amiable, fairly
beaming on the men whom he recog
nized at the ringside. He weighed 2'la
pounds, the most of which seemed
taken up by his immense sloping
shoulders and arms. From the waist
down ne had the weij-turned muscu
lar legs of a sprinter, stout enough to
carry him any distance, but with no
unnecessary bulk. His naturally dirk
ekin Â« af tanned to a deep mahogany.
After the fight Jeffries said he never
felt in all hie ring career such confi
dence in his punching ability. He was
just warming up to his work when pro
ceedings were stopped.
Munroe presented an entirely differ
ent type of athlete to Jeffries. While
he weighed but ten pounds less a casual
glance would lead one to think there
wee a -iifference of fully fifty pounds.
While the bulk of Jeffries' weight was
above the waist and all fighting mate
rial, that of Munroe seemed below the
waipt and in the legs.
Whether from stage fright or timid
ity Monroe did not strike one effective
bljW --2vrV?S the Ehort and one-sided
battle. TV. th* spectators the blow
which took all the fight out of him
v.a? a Jeft upp^rcut to the body, much
tfc* same blow which took all the light
out of Ruhlin. In discussing the affair
in hie dressing-room Jeffries eaid it
was a left to the Jaw which started
Muorot on the downward path.
When the ?ong sent the two men to
gether Jeffries went right after his
man. He crouched but slightly, keep
ins his left we!! out. After a couple of
feints h* landed a left to the head,
which shook up Munroe. He followed
this with a hard uppercut and then
c<=nt a right to- the body. Munroe
6*em*4 to fchrink In thÂ° size of a middle
weight. Jeffries was smiling as if sur
prised at the easy game Munroe was
proving for him. Jeffries sent a short
left hook to the ear and Munroe
dropped to his knees. He was up in a
few seconds, only to get a left to the
body. Jeffries then crossed his right
ow t.^ the head, staggering Munroe.
He followed this with a left uppercut
to the body and then sent left to the
head and body like a flash. Another
right ard left staggered Munroe. Jef
fries outfelnted him easily and sent
him down at-ain with a left and right
to the brxiy. MunroÂ» stood up and
Jeffries was about to lead again, when
the b*'I sounded the end of the round.
Munro* staggered toward his corner
and wh*n he eat down spectators could
teÂ»: his fare -*as terribly puffed wher
ever Jeffries' gloves had come In con
tact with him. His left eye was nearly
clos^'t and the other was badly black
Â«,ea.
M UXROE A TIRED BOXER.
Murroe came up for the second round
a tirâ d boxer. Jeftries went at him at
once, sending a left to the body ami
then a I*>ft to, the head twice without
a return. His loft was working HUo a
piston rod on Munroe's jaw and the
unfortunate man from ButfÂ» could ;v>t
defend himself/ Jeffries landed a<?-.=r
rateiy on head ami body and Munroe
finally went .fWv n from left to the jaw.
The house was in a lumult whlie Time
ktej^r Baiting was filling off the fate
ful un Â«M?conds. Neither,, the fighi^rK
nor Referee Graney knew that the tlmu
Â«at up. and Jeffries was preparing to
deliv-r a decisive blow, when the
referee stepped between the men and
motioned to Jeffries that he was the
winner. Referee Graney saw the help
less condition of Munroe and had asked
his seconds: to toss up the sponge. As
they were slow about this he humanely
stopped the unequal contest. Munroe
?tagg<:red to his coiner, bleeding pro
fuseiy from a number of cuts about the
face.
Jeltiies hits with so much ease that
the spectators never appreciate the ter
rible force he puts into his blows.
â¢ Immediately after the '.ontest Munroe
commenced spitting blood, indicating
that he had been hurt internally.
It was it: 17 o'clock when a shout went
up from th<> spectators in the gallery
announcing the approach of the glad*
iatcrs. Munrce was the first to be seen
forcing his way through the crowd. He
wore a big overcoat over his fighting
riÂ§; and as he forced his way toward
the ring his pallor was noticeable. Ht
was followed by "Kid McCoy." who
looked mere like a sallow faced col
legian than a premier exponent of
fifcticuffs; Tim McGrath. short and
chunky, with the latest in gauze shirts;
Frank McDonald and "Twin" Sullivan,
who were to act as towel swingers
and water carriers. Right after Mun
roe came Jeffries, stripped for action
and looking unusually formidable. The
champion was chewing gum and his
ciaik face was wreathed in smiles.
FIGHTERS ARE INTRODUCED.
Jeff wore his old-time black trunks
and around his waist was the Amer
ican flag belt that had seen service in
ail his battlts. Munroe wore, green
tights and an elastic band of blue oÂ£
unusual width. His belt consisted of
a red, white and blue ribbon. Munroe's
hands were incased in bandages and
looked bulky. Jeffries had no bandages
on hi.s hands, as he has confidence in
his ability to hit hard and in the
proper fashion. Jeff stood up while
Munroe sat and gazed in open-eyed
wonder at his massive opponent. Mc-
Coy came over and shook hands with
the champion. Dcianey and Brother
Jack and then retired to look after the
miner.
Munroe was first to be introduced
by Billy Jordan, whose splendid voice
was unheard amid the tumult and the
shouting of the Immense crowd. He
announced him as "the miners' pride.
Of Butte, Montana." Jeffries was the
next to be presented, and again the
announcement was drowned by the
cheers and comments. Jordan yelled
that Jeffries was "the only champion
of the world." Eddie Graney, the "hon
est horse-shoer," was too modest to be
introduced. He moved around the ring
86 if in a ballroom. He was attired
in an immaculate Tuxedo. "Kid" Mc-
Coy was introduced as "the Beau
Brummel of the prize ring, who was
open to fight any man in the world,
save Jeffries."
Jeffries showed Eome Interest in hia
opponent while waiting for the cam
era men to fix their machines. He said
to Delaney: "Take a look at his
hands," and the trainer replied: "I
did; they're all right." Jeffries went
to Munroe's corner and examined the
bandages.
JEFFRIES INSPECTS GLOVES.
Jeff made a close inspection of the
gloves that were handed to him. as
he did not care to have them break, as
one did when he fought Corbett. He
then got up and tried the floor of the
ring and Munroe's eyes opened wider.
Jeff then toid Jimmy Brltt to go over
and look at Munroe put on the gloves.
Jarnes Edward tripped across the can
vas and "rubbered." Manager Harry
Pollok performed the same office for
Munroe. He watched Delaney and
Brother Jack as they put the gloves
on the champion.
A small fight among the spectators
for possession of a* chair interested the
fighters for half a' minute. When Jeff
and Munroe stood up to be photo
graphed Munroe kept his eyes away
from Jeff. The champion grasped the
miner by the hand and posed. Trie
ring was cleared and the referee called
the men for final instructions.
Billy Jordan then announced that
thp men had agreed to fight straight
Marquis of Queer.sberry rules and pro
tect themselves In the clinches. With
the final and familiar cry, "Let 'cr
go." the bell clanged and the short fight
was on.
) As there are no more men" for Jef
fries to meet, he seems destined to fill
the place of strong man In the circus.
In the' condition he showed last night
he could defeat a whole ring full of
aspirants for the championship. Jack
Johnson had announced his intention of
challenging the winner, but one glance
at Jeffries caused him to change his
mind. He maintained a discreet si
lence.

I was in the best of condition and hare no complaint to offer on

SACR.\MENTO. Aug. 26. -The State
, Fair race meeting caught Us old-time
. ~- Â¦Â¦Â¦-Â¦Â¦Â¦/Â¦
, swing to-day and a fairly good card
1 was run off before a fair attendance.
\ with a little something doing in the
i' betting ring at all times.
The syndicate book fattened the or
1 dinarily lean programme by giving an
, additional race, a seven furlong func
tion! over which the <?dds were so
tight that it would have required a
: burglar Â¦with a jimmy to break in.
At post time there was a slight loos
; enin?, but those who fancied they were
wearing their sporting raiment had not
recovered from the first shock suffi
l ciently to make a plunge and the syn
: dicate quit to the good and the day.
A quartet of teamsters tried to break
1 Vf. G. D'jrfee's string of luck in the in
itial event, a 2:27 trot, but failed sig
nally. Reta H, the well played favor
. ite. winning a creditable race in
Â¦ straight heats. Nance O'Neil. after
; dropping tbe first heat to Billy Red,
; won the second race, a pace for the
2:27 class, and her victory was a popu
1 lar one. In the second heat Billy Red
! crowded the mare almost cm top of the
: rail and when Zibble registered a pro
: test with the judges, it was heeded and
, the heat awarded to Nance O'Neil.
Idalum, at even money, landed the
talent's money in the third race, a
handicap for all ages, at five furlongs.
; Enjoyment showed a burst of speed in
j the stretch and beat Wandering Boy
j for the place. Johnson fell off Gray
! Morn at the half-mile post, but was
Â¦ not seriously hurt.
Edgecliffe was supposed to be the
i good thing in the fourth race, a handi
i cap for two-year-olds, at five furlongs.
; He was backed down to 1 to 3, but was
; beaten a length by Gossiper. an
\ even money chance, Anita Knight, at
j 5 to 1. being third.
Sir Preston, a 1 to 2 favorite, took
. the fifth race, five furlongs, winning
[easily by a length from Our Pride.
Fille d'Or won the closing event of
1 the day, seven furlongs, beating Hua-
I pala two lengths. Pilot was third.

CHICAGO, Aug. 26.â Irene Lindsey.
cnvned by E. E. Smathers of New York, i
won the third and feature event of
the Hawthcrne card to-day, which was !
a six furlong handicap. The big mare, !
which was always favorite in the bet- J
ting at 3 tcr 5, picked up 116 pounds |
and covered the three-quarters in j
1:13 3-5, leading all the way by a big'
margin and having at the end two-and '
a half lengths to spare over Eig Ben.
The latter, with 117 pounds up, ran a
smashing race. He laid second and ,
well up all the way, outsprinting Clif
ton Forge easily, and at the finish was
five lengths in front of Ananias for the
place. Corrigan's colt ran a dull race.
From point of numbers the best card
of the present meeting was offered. The
n^ids als</ were, nicely balanced, mak
ing interesting contention possible in
each event. The track was at its best
and the weather fine. The attendance
was hardly up to the average. Sum

That the Futurity will be a contest
between millionaires and their horses
is apparent at a glance at the names of
the owners of those which are bulle
tined to start for the $55,000 race to
morrow. Only a millionaire can afford
to refuse $100,000 for a two-year-old, as
James R. Keene has done, and If Sy
sonby, the colt which was not for sale
at the price mentioned, is worth the
sum, surely Hanya, which has already
won more than $60,000 this year and
may win $50,000 more to-day, is worth
as much as Sysonby.
The trio of fillies which will race in
the interest of Herman B. Duryea are
the product of stallions and mares for
which the late William C. Whitney
paid a fortune, and that the product of
Hamburg and Meddler should race up
to the reputation of their progenitors
is only to be expected.
Tradition may not win to-day, but it
Is declared by turfmen that no filly of
her age gives brighter promise of bril
liant maturity next year. She is owned
by the multi-millionaire James B. Hag
gin, and races in the name and colors
of Sydney Papot for business reasons.
August Belmont owns Woodsaw,
which *also races in the name and colors
of Paget, but it is an assured thing
that this colt will bear his owner's
colors next season.
Glorlfler also Is owned by one of the
turfs most wealthy patrons, Louis V
Bell.
It is a fact, however, that the great
race to be run has. in the minds of
the experts, really settled down to a
contest between horses owned or
raced by two, or. at the most, three of
the wealthiest turfmen of the country.
Rarely, indeed, in these days does one
see a "poor man's'* colt looming up as
a Futurity possibility. â¢ Long before
the date of the race the colt would
have been sold at a fancy figure too
high" for any poor man gifted with good
sense to refuse.
With the field Including Sysonby.
winner of the Brighton Junior and the
Saratoga Special; Tanya, which has
already captured the rich National
Stallion and Hopeful stakes, and Tra
dition, also a stake winner, horsemen

ALAMEDA, Aug. 26. â Joseph F.
Fordecer, president of the Alameda
Board of Trustees, explained last night
at a meeting of the West End Im
provement Association that if the de
mands of the various municipal de
partments for an increase of salaries
and of the Board of Education for
maintenance of the schools of the city
were to be met, the tax rate would
have to be fixed at a rate not less than
$1 49 on each $100 of property valuation.
Fred T. Moore, superintendent of
schools, said the school department had
long been conducted on lines second
to none in the United States.
"If the school department Is to be
conducted according to Its present
high standard," said Mr. Moore, "we
must have the amount of money from
th* city that our estimate calls for.
It is poor economy to allow our school
buildings to deteriorate for want of a
little paint or varnish, and the under
standing when the present Board of
Trustees was elected was that the de
partment was to be conducted accord
ing to the presenthigh standard."
Frank Otis, one "of the members of
the Board of Education, and George
Renner also made short addresses.
The matter of entertaining the visit
ing Knights Templar was also touched
upon.

OAKLAND, Aug. 26.â The Union La
bor party county convention, called to
meet at Germania Hall to-night, went
to pieces before it had effected perma-
nent organization, and the large ma
jority''of the delegates marched over
to the cooks and waiters' headquarters
and attended a meeting there, which
Is to be followed by another to lay
out a programme for the conduct of
union labor politics during the coming
campaign.
Wild disorder followed the announce
ment made bv J. Ehard, who got up
in the convention and said that he saw
sitting in this delegation a man who
had "scabbed" during the butchers'
strike, and that he refused to sit with
him and he called upon all union men
to follow him. With him went nearly
the entire convention, leaving but
about, thirty delegates of the 192 who
answered to roll call. Every new de
serter was greeted with cheers, and
finally Chairman Paul Wuthe stated,
that he resigned his position (as chair
man and declared the meeting ad
journed until next Friday night. The
meeting was called to order by J. B.
Crandall, with R. J. Silva acting as
secretary.
The remark that they had been sold
was shouted from different parts of the
room. T. L. Holden and L. R. James
were placed in nomination for secre
tary, and to avoid a contest both men
were called upon to serve. Chairman
Wuthe then announced the following
committees:
Platform and resolutions â J. Jo
seph, R.^M. Smith, M. D. Cook, J. D.
Kay, H. B. Wayne. E. L. Bair and L.
R. James. Permanent organizationâ

Day. Credentialsâ J. B. Crandall, G.
M. Britt, J. D. Owens, E. F. O'Brien,
H. Alkus, W. C. Allen and F. O'Connor.
After the reports of the committees
had been read by the secretary the
floor was obtained by A. J. Sunderer,
who denounced the meeting as a fraud.
He was followed by J. Ehard, who
called upon the union men to follow
him out of the hall.
J. B. Reboll presided at the meeting
at Cooks* and Waiters' Hall. Many
speeches were made, including one by
Wuthe, who said he had been deceived
and that he should have nothing more
to do with the convention.
Leaders of the delegates who walked
out said they were undecided whether
to return to the convention next Friday
night and reorganize it, or name an in
dependent lot of condidates.

2148 Center Street, Aug. 26.
Â¦ Judge Samuel H. Wright, Whose
I twenty years, of service on the District
1 bench of Nevada made his name known
to almost every inhabitant in the Silver
State, a jurist whose opinions are
quoted often in the courts and a man
whose allegiance to Republicanism was
unswerving, died this morning at the
family home, 2201 Ellsworth street,
after a lingering illness. Heart dis
ease, from which he had suffered for
years, was the cause of death.
Most of Judge Wright's life career
was spent in the West. It was re
markable in many respects and there
were many thrilling episodes in the
twenty years spent on the Nevada
bench. Crossing the plains in a wagon
train from Kentucky in 1849, Judge
Wright settled in Marysville, engaging
in business there for a number of years.
Later he went to Santa Clara, serving
there as Justice and postmaster.
The mining excitement attracted the
jurist to Carson City and a few months
after his arrival there he was elected
to the bench upon which he served so
long. Ten years ago Judge Wright re
tired and came to Berkeley, where he
had since lived in well earned ease.
"Only a few days ago we refused a
compromise of $2000. I had no idea
our time was out and I consider that
my attorneys have intentionally al
lowed this matter to go against us. We
have been defrauded of a considerable
mm of money and, while we must
acquiesce in the order of the court,
1 shall see if there is not some way
in which the attorneys can be punished
<->r this. I tried to get rid of them
some time ago on account of their in
action in the matter, but I could not
get them to sign the substitution pa
pers."
In answer to her query, Judge Ogden
advised her t*iat if she wished to bring
the matter before the Grand Jury she
would have to apply to the District At
torney, 'or if she wanted damages,
which would be her best plan, she
could seek redress through the courts.
Notice of a motion to be made to
this effect was sent to Louise Matthai
and with her sister she appeared in
court and made the statement that It
had always been her intention to pros
ecute the case, but that for one reason
or another the suit had been continued
from time to time and iier lawyers had
put off the trial. In this connection,
the witness said:

Rose and Louise Matthai accused
their attorneys, Webber and Ruther
ford of Napa, before Judge Ogden this
morning with having neglected their
interests, allowing a $25,000 damage
suit against the estate of the late
George C. Stanley to go by default.
They are left, they say, without relief
in the matter other than such satisfac
tion as they can get out of their attor
neys throueh civil process.
Frank Matthai shot and killed George
C. Stanley in a quarrel over a mag
nesite claim located in Xapa County.
The property was owned by Louise
Matthai and she began a suit for $25,
000 against the estate of Stanley for
magmesite used by Stanley from her
claim. This suit has been in court for
the last three years, and this morning
Judge Ogdcn struck the case from the
docket on the ground of lack of prose
cution.

Justice of the Peace W. R, Geary, but
the weapon was discharged when, ac

Mrs. Robinson was discharged.
v The women quarreled about a dun for
$6 40, which Mrs. Verweibe claimed wks
due from Mrs. Robinson. There was
not any doubt about the display of a
pistol, but the evidence was not suffi
cient to show that the weapon had been
fired while the storekeeper was within
range or sight. It was intimated that

The promptings of curiosity led the
youths to sally forth to inspect the
sign about 3 o'clock this morning, the
word having been passed around that
it was going to be put up. While en
gaged in admiring the legend, in the
company of some other students they
met, the police appeared. The quar
tet, having nothing to fear, walked
leisurely along, but the others fled. A
moment later the four were surrounded
by as many university guardians, who
ordered them to throw up their hands
and, by' way of emphasis, rubbed big
pistols against their noses.
To be arrested for nothing and
threatened with pistols besides the
youths thought was bad enough, but
their feelings were further outraged
when they were escorted to' the super
intendent's office. They were not only
placed under guard and lock, but hand
cuffed, too. They pleaded against this
unnecessary humiliation, but without
avail. v The policemen forced them to
remain Bitting in chairs for the rest
of the night and this morning took
them to the County Jail, where they
remained until friends balled them out.
"It was an outrageous proceeding, 1 '
said Schreiber, one of the; victims,
after his release. "In the first place, we
did nothing more â¢ than look at the
sign. It had been strung before we ar
rived. Even if we had put it up, the
offense did not call for such unneces
sary measures to humiliate us. Su
perintendent's Bolton's policemen are
altogether too officious. The entire stu
dent body is incensed against the su
perintendent and I have received sym
pathy from all sides. I do not think
the matter will be ended with the
court proceedings, which I am confi
dent will be quashed."
All the young men arrested are well
connected. 'Besides having been Agui
naldo's secretary, . Buencamino's father
has held high office under the -new
government in. the Philippines and he
was one of the Filipino commissioners
to the t World's Fair. Taylor's uncle
is the Sheriff of Marin County. and the
others are sons of well- known San
Francisco business men.
A-university professor visited Justice
Edgar's court this afternoon and asked
some questions that would - indicate
that the university authorities will' pre
fer the graver charge of tampering
with electric light wires against the
accused youths. ~ There Is a State law
BERKELEY, Aug. 26.â Felipe Buen
camino <s as much an Insurrecto
against constituted authority in the
University of California as his illus
trious father of the same name used to
be against the United States when he
was Secretary of State in Agulnaldo'a
Cabinet. With three other students he
was arrested at an unseemly hour on
the university campus for participat
ing in a sophomore trick, ' designed to
confuse the freshies. As Buencamino
has been in trouble before, Professor
C. L. Cory having arrested him on last
Charter day night, he is likely now to
suffer the penalty of dismissal.
Buencamino's companions In this
night-time prank were D. W. Taylor,
H. TV. Schreiber and Clair Gordon.
They are accused of decorating- the
university grounds. The youths de
clare that they are not guilty. Their
arrest they characterize as an outrage,
and they are particularly Incensed
against Grounds Superintendent Bolton
and his minions, whom they charge
with overofflciousness. The students
intend to appeal to President Wheeler
for redress!
As the story comes from the lips of
the quartet, they were observing a
sign that had been put up on the
grounds by other students two hours
before they appeared on the scene. This
sign was of cloth and bore the legend,
"Welcome '08, Baby Class." It was
forty feet long and stretched on an
electric light wire between North and
South halls. Â¦

PROMINENT JAPANESE
, TO TAKE A FAIR BRIDE
Ihu?c Okubo, a Little Brown Dentist
Practicing: Here, Will Marry
Waka Iseri This Evening.
I Ihuge Okubo, a Japanese dentist,
will take a fair maid from the Mikado's
land for his wife. At the Japanese
Presbyterian Church,' 121 Haight street,
this evening Rev. K. Inazawa will tie
the knot that will make Mlsa Waka
Iseri Mrs. Okubo. * , -
The groom is a prosperous dentist,
being one of the only two licensed Jap
anese dentists in California. Miss
Iseri arrived here on the steamship
Siberia on its last trip, coming directly
from her native land, where she re
cently graduated from college. She
reads English well but does not speak
it. .
Ihuge Okubo me^t his bride when ho
was a boy, attending the college of
which her uncle was president. He was
a favorite of the uncle, who promised
that he would eive his niece to iiirn
some day. Okubo came to this coun
try more than ten years ago. In his
spare time he studied dentistry at the
College of Physicians and Surgeons.
He took the last examination of the
State Board cf Dental Examiners and
passed.' He prospered at his profession
and sent home for his bride.
The Rev. Hugh W. Fraser, pastor of
Brooklyn Presbyterian Church, has
been requested, with practical unanim
ity, by his large congregation, to with
draw his letter of resignation and he
has accepted the invitation. This ac
tion disposes of a bit of a strained sit
uation which had 4 developed apparently
out of thin air in one of Oakland's larg
est church organizations.
Several weeks ago Dr. Fraser was
approached by one of the church offi
cers, who suggested that the pastor's
resignation might be acceptable. It
was hinted that members had become
dissatisfied with the spiritual life of
the church, that the standard did not
seem to have been maintained. This
and some vague criticisms were made,
much to the amazement of Dr. Fraser
and some of his stanch friends, with
whom he conferred as soon as the dis
turbing rumors reached his ears.
Investigation was set on foot and it
was decided to test, as soon as church
law gave opportunity, the real senti
ment of the parishioners. To this end,
in accordance with Presbyterian rule,
the pastor wrote a letter to his con
gregation reque'sting them to join wrth
him in a letter to the Presbytery of
Oakland, urging that ruling body to
withdraw the pastor from his charge.
That letter was the basis of a called
meeting of the congregation, which was
held Wednesday night during the pas
tor's absence at Hay wards. The/sltu
atlon was threshed out from all points
of view. The rumors were sifted and
out of it all not a thing tangible was
foui>d. There had been a little indi
vidual discussion of church affairs
which had enlarged beyond the scope
it had been intended to take. Hence
the disquieting aspect the "tempest in
a teapot" assumed.
The course of Dr. Fraser. during his
five years of pastorate was approved
cordially.

It was reported to me that the baby's death
was not from a natural cause; that there were
Â«o many suspicious circumstances surround iruc
the casft that I should be remiss unless I made
a very careful Inquiry. The child 'died from
hunger, and the father Is so 111 from starvation
that the doctors at the County Hospital say
he is in a serious condition. The mother Is in
like state and is also deficient mentally. As
soon as I have received a detailed, 'report from
the autopsy surg-eon. Dr. J. K. Warner of
Livermore, I shall hold an Inquest. â¢
Father and mother near death from
starvation and their three-month-old
child in the hands' of the Coroner from
the same cause is the piteous plight
of Frank 'Galindo and his wife, re
vealed to-day through an investigation
which was made by Coroner H. - B.
Mehrmann.
Barely alive, the father was sent to
the County Infirmary by the Coroner's
order this afternoon. The mother was
taken in charge by people at Liver
more, where the family afrived
Wednesday, the baby having* died
while they were nearing. the town after
a hard trip from Red Bluff.
It was because of. a rumor that the
baby had died from unnatural causes
which led Coroner Mehrmann to begin
an inquiry of the circumstances. He
found that the family had left Red
Bluff Sunday in a wagon. The hard
journey of 250 miles under stress- of
great poverty, with lack of proper
nourishment for either the parents or
the child, caused the infant's death.
It was not until this afternoon that
the Coroner discovered that the hus
band and wife were in such a critical
condition. Galindo, it had been re
ported, was shamming illness to avoid
questioning about the death of his
child. The fact was that he was actual
ly starving and could barely be moved
to the hospital. Mrs. Galindo's phys
ical condition was accentuated by a
manifest weakening of her mental fac
ulties.
. Galindo has relatives residing near
Livermore. It was through them, ac
cording to the report that was filed
with the Coroner, that the suspicions
were aroused concerning the baby's
death.
Coroner Mehrmann ordered rn au
topsy to be held in the case of the
child and he will conduct an Inquest
to-morrow. The father, the Coroner
said, had been confined for a term rn
a State Prison, and this fact also had
a bearing upon the rumors that had
been spread concerning the baby's end.
Touching the case, Coroner Mehr
mann.said: , â .- .... . . %T:."^

In his opinion Judge Dickey said the
action was an entirely new one in the
courts, but he came to the conclusion
that the arbitration agreement was not
enforceable by the means sought, or by
any other method, for the reason
stated.
"It is well settled," said the court,
"that an employer has a right to em
ploy and discharge any one he pleases,
and a workman may work or refuse to
work at will."

"The packers have said just what
they said before: that they are run
ning their plants and have nothing to
arbitrate, and that there is no reason
why they should confer with the men.
"We heard a review of the entire strike
trouble, and the packers say that in
every city, except Chicago and Omaha,
the strike Is over, and they assert that
75- per cent as many men as they em
ployed in Chicago before the strike arc
now turning out 92 per cent of the nor
mal output."
Labor leaders to-night announced
that in all probability the butchers'
strike would be "settled peaceably" be
fore next "Wednesday. They declined
to explain the cause of their belief, but
were positive in their statements that
the strike would not be called off.
CHICAGO, Aug. 26.â The conference
of the committee appointed earlier in
the week to attempt a settlement of the
stockyards strike with the parties to
the disDUte resulted in nothing. There
is no present prospect of peace, and
the chances of an agreement between
the packers and the strikers being
reached appear very meager. The strike
leaders appeared before the committee
this morning arid stated their side of
the case: They did not suggest to the
Aldermanic committee that it make any
overtures to the packers, but simply
gave their side of the case. Represen

before the committee. After a session

the fact that last week's variations in

be impossible to restore national pros

greatly reduced.

Their operations in are sup
ported from Gutziatzy, three miles
higher up the Lian River and along
the Taitse River, as shown in the dis
patch reporting that the Russian front
south of the Taitse River was engaged
and that General Kuroki was simul
taneously moving on Liandiansian,
along the high road, as reported from
Liaoyang last night, and by the fact
that another Japanese column Is mov
ing on Liandiansian along the south
road from'SIaolindzy, ten miles north
east of Haicheng.
That General Kuropatkin has fore
seen these various movements Is shown
by the manner in which the attack on
Tanzapu was met and by the repulse
of the Japanese at Slaolindzy.
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 26.â After
a four weeks' interval the Japanese
have resumed their advance against
General Kuropatkin's positions. The
opposing armies are in contact east
and south of Liaoyang and fighting
has been in progress since Wednes
day. The advices at hand are too
meager to enable the officials to form
a correct opinion as to whether it will
result in a general engagement, but the
extent and character of the Japanese
movement leads to that conclusion*
Since the rains ceased a week ago
there have been continued Intimations
that General Kuropatkin was about to
assume the offensive, but instead of
that it was the Japanese who attacked
the Russian commander's eastern and
southern positions. A Japanese col
umn, 30,000 strong, was reported on
Tuesday to be marching up the right
bank of the Lian River, which would
seem to indicate that three Japanese
armies are co-operating In enveloping
three sides of Liaoyang. From the
meager accounts received it appears
that General Kuroki selected Tantzla
pudze as the point for his attempt to
drive the wedge into Kuropatkin's out
er defenses at Anping and Liandian
sian, which are situated, respectively,
ten miles northwest and southwest qf
Tantxlapudze, the latter being on the
Lian River, eight miles above the con
fluence of the Taitse River, whence a
mountain ridge runs westward.
The fact that the Japanese are pre
paring pontoons at the Taitse River
was noted in these dispatches several
days ago. The capture of this bridge
will be the first obstacle of the Japan
ese and doubtless will entail severe
fighting, in which the Japanese proba
bly count on the superiority of their
mountain guns. If they be successful,
the Russian position at Anping and
Liandiansian will become precarious.

there is no hope of taking- Port Arthur

Raymond Recouly, correspondent of

follows to his paper:
"I was -fortunate this morning to
travel with an American naval at
tache (Lieutenant Newton A. McCully),
who has just returned from Port Ar
thur after a sojourn there of three
months. The news he gives me is en
tirely different from the pessimistic
reports current lately concerning the
situation at the fortress.
"The American attache left the fort
ress on August 14. The Japanese were
then four and a half miles from the
city. The Russian positions upon a
chain of rugged hills 200 meters high
were protected by trenches, mines, net
works, barbed wire and cannon, and,
according to the American officer. It
was impossible to take them by as
sault. Japanese shells fell Into the
city, but each position possessed a dug
out, in which the occupants were able
to secure shelter. The Japanese heavy
guns ceased firing every night, fearing
that the Russians would detect their
exact location by the flashes during
the darkness.
"There was a considerable stock of
provisions at Port Arthur. The Rus
sian soldiers had a fresh meat ratidn
daily. The reports that Russian offi
cers were subsisting: on onions and
black bread were absurd inventions.
The stores were still open and the pop
ulation promenaded the streets.
"The regiments took turns in the
trenches. Part of the garrison was al
ways resting. The Russian sailors as
sisted In the defense of the fortress.
They made excellent sharpshooters.
The heat has not been unbearabfe.
"The American attache believes that
the Japanese losses have been very

5 HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT
GARDEN, LONDON, Aug. 15.â Those
in the United States who are interested
in the millions left by the late Mrs.
Blake of Ireland probably will be dis
appointed to hear that though the
Irish party in Parliament will make
an attempt to prevent the British
treasury from taking possession of this
fortune, the matter is not likely to
come up for settlement before the be
ginning of 1905.
Mrs. Blake, It will be remembered,
bore the maiden name of Sheridan,
came from County Longford and, be
fore her marriage with Captain Blake,
was a servant. The fortune of $2,500,
000 which she left when she died in
testate in London thirty-three years
ago had been accumulated by Captain
Blake in California.
The discovery of descendants of Mrs.
Blake in the. United States, however,
was made when a British Government
official named Quirke, employed by the
Colonial Office in India, started an in
vestigation about a year ago. He did
so- on behalf of a friend named Sheri
dan, an ex-soldier in the Indian army.
Sheridan had satisfied Mr. Quirke that
he was a lineal descendant of Mrs.
Helen Blake. Quirke was coming to
England on a twelve months' holiday
and he undertook to devote a larjre
amount: of his time in trying to estab
lish the claim of his friend to at least
a share of these millions. Sheridan Is
a native of the County of Longford
in Ireland and thence Mr. Quirke re
paired to try to build up a family tree.
As the result, in the midst of many
spurious claimants, he discovered one
Special Correspondence
or two whom he thought were entitled
to a share in the Blake fortune.
He learned, too, that there were pos
sible descendants by the name of Sher
idan living in both Baltimore and Bos
ton, U. S. A. He hastened across thÂ«-
Atlantic to interview them and foun<l
that quite a number of them could claim
some distant relationship with his
friend in India. He had the same diffi
culty in separating the chaff from th>?
corn in the United States that he had
in Ireland, but he tame back armtvl
with a mass of material sufficiently
tangible, to justify him in bombarding
the English Treasury, which. In the
meantime, was getting ready to '"se
questrate" the fortune. With the accu
mulated Interest this now amounts t.Â»
about $5,000,00).
But the Court of Chancery, which
takes possession of all intestates' prop
erty, having gone through the usual
formalities In endeavoring to find thv
next of kin, refused to listen to Mr.
Quirke after all the time and money
he had spent in the interests of th"
Sheridans an>l their numerous progeny.
He had exhausted his holiday and had
to return to India, but before he left
he invited a number .Â»f Irish Members
of Parliament to take posses?i<>n of his
documents and bring: the subject be
fore the House of Commons. Mr. J.
P. Farrell, M. P. for Longford, the
county which < laim? the distinction of
being th'.> birthplace Â«>f Mrs. Flake, ha?
the matter in hand and he has already
commenced to stir up the law officers
of* the crown. There is a reasonah'
prospect that the Government will
grant an inquiry at once, but a delay
of several months is expected before
any decisive action is taken, as the
Parliamentary session is so nearly at
an end.

who was so savagely beaten in the prize-ring that his reason fled and his
wretched career was. mercifully closed by dfeath in the madhouse at Stock

. brutal, barbarous privilege still remains unanswered to those of us that boast
of our humanity and our progress.

FASHIONS, HOME HINTS AND OTHER THINGS IN THE REALM OF WOMAN
(COPYRIGHT. 1904. BY SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL AND THE NEW YORK EVENING MAIL..)
This attempt to extract partisan capital out of a movement that took
itÂ« inspiration from the President's message is simply flagrant. If party
weight and strength in securing the law are to be awarded praise it
belongs to the President and his party in Congress. The action at Santa
Cruz is, however, characteristic of the party that took it. It camps on
the trail of Republican progress and posts pre-emption notices on accom
plished Republican policies, claiming them for its own. In a few years,
if the Democracy survive its next defeat, it will be found claiming the
credit for securing the gold standard and sound money. It is already
preparing to annex to itself the credit for the benefits of protection, ana
if it live long enough will claim that it fought the war for the Union and
abolished slavery.
While a majority of the committee were Republicans, in its member
ship were Democrat* and Populists, for it was a getting together of the
We?t for a high economic purpose, which would not have been effective
ii partisanship had appeared at any part of the movement. When the bill
was drawn and presented the President regarded it as weak in the features
protective of the interests of the small landholder and informed the men
in charge of i; that, if passed without repairing that infirmity, he would
veto it. He dictated the amendment which prevents the grabbing of
large tracts of the land to be irrigated and protects the small holder,
putting the maximum holding at 160 acres. The bill passed as so amended
and became a law- by the signature of President Roosevelt.
The law obsoletes the rather valid objection of the East to taxation
;o make competing lands productive by using the proceeds of the sale
of public land as an irrigation fund. This fund is perpetuated by requiring
the holders of irrigated lands to repay to the Government the cost of
irrigated lands in easy installments. By this plan, when all the land
possible of irrigation has been covered by water, the whole sum expended
by the Government will finally be paid back by the landholders and will
go into the treasury as part of the resources of the Government.
Republicans regarded it as z great public measure for the development
and settlement of the West, in which men of all parties participated with
out thought of partisanship. The Republican party controlled both houses
of Congress and its support was necessary to effectuate the measure. If
the law had immediately proved a failure the Democratic State Convention
at Santa Cruz would have denounced the Republican party for that failure,
i^it the law is a success and so that convention sought to make party
capital by claiming it as a party measure.
In doing this the convention was inexpert and unhappy. It roused
expectations as to the operation of the law in California, the realization
of which is in great doubt. Except en the Colorado Desert, where there
are public lands to which the law may apply, there is probably no con
siderable area of irrigable lands that can receive benefit from the Federal
law.
Pre?ident Roosevelt, with an intimate and sympathetic knowledge of
the West, saw' the whole problem, and not its various parts. In his
mes<ape of December, 1901, he outlined and advocated the present law.
Immediate^- a voluntary committee on irrigation was formed, consisting
of seventeen Senators and Representatives from the arid West. That
committee held frequent meetings and polished the proposition down until
all the local differences and diverse plans were canceled out and reached
an agreement that approximated the views of -the President. What is
called "the Xewlands bill" was the result of these conferences' and was
the final issue of the voluntary committee.
Many and futile efforts had been made to secure such an irrigation law.
It was regarded in the East as a sectional Western measure, and as long
as it was a proposition to take money out of the Federal treasury â the
proceeds of taxation of all the people, and to which the East made the
greatest contribution â the plan made no headway against the objection
of Eastern farmers, who opposed being taxed to bring new land into
production in competition with their own. But this was not the onlj'
difficulty. The representatives of the arid States were unable to agree
among themselves. Many of them wanted the arid lands ceded to the
States and others wanted a Federal law that would apply to the local
conditions of the States the>' represented.
THE frail and fragmentary Democratic State Convention at Santa Cruz,
in feeling around for an issue, prof&ssed to have found one in the
national irrigation law, which it claimed as a Democratic measure
and proceeded to annex with much and florid language. The morality of
this attempt to filch the merit of a great measure for partisan purposes
is not open to any question. Its character is stamped upon it. It is
immoral.

Rev. Thomas S. Young, pastor of

delivered a graphic account of his trip
To the Holy Land at the Hamilton
Square Baptist Church. Post street,
n._-ar Fillmore, last night. The Rev.
Mr. Young was one of the delegates,
with Dr. H. H. Bell of this city, to
the Worlds Sunday-school Convention
which was held at Jerusalem. He re
turned with a fund of interesting in
formation and also with an invaluable
collection of pictures of localities and
arsons of the Holy Land, which he
showed in the course of his remarks
to the delight of a large audience.

It has been reported that inadvert
ently the committee having charge of
the selection first called her sister, Miss
Martha Mitchell, to christen the
cruiser, but Mies Jenet was the sister
chosen. The choice of a daughter- of
the late Senator is a compliment to
his prominence as a statesman in na
tional affairs and also as a compliment
to the Grand Army of the Republic, of
which he was a member.
The launching committee accompany
ing Miss Mitchell are General Louis
Auer, E. P. Hackett, Julian O. Frank
and O. E. Bartlett. A gift of a $5000
silver service donated by. the citizens
of Milwaukee will be presented to the
cruiser, and a library to the future
men behind her guns.
Miss Lilly Jeffrey, daughter of Vice
President Frank Jeffrey of the Union
Iron Works, will rouse the electric
spark that will loosen Uncle Sam's
youngest seafighter from the shore and
send her to her native element, and
Miss Jeriet Mitchell will christen the
cruiser as she goes. She is the daugh
ter of the late United States Senator
John L. Mitchell of Wisconsin, and has
been selected by the commonwealth of
that State to name their vessel at the
launching. September 10.
Miss Mitchell, with her party, will
leave Milwaukee the 5th of next month
to land in San Francisco three days
later.
She is the second daughter of the late
Senator, and was born in the city
whose name she will give the great
craft. She is a highly gifted young
lady, trained in the best educational
Institutions of America and* Europe.
She and Mrs. Mitchell were in this city
at the launching of the battleship Wis
consin.
One of the most interesting and im
pressive events in connection with the
coming Knights Templar Conclave will
be the launching of a completed war
vessel. There will be a dainty and
graceful feature to the affair for
\\ hen the big red armored cruiser
down at the Union Iron Works, which
will be known as the Milwaukee, is
ready to ?lip away, two fair maidens
will stand at the vessel's stem. One
will be from the Central West, the
other from the Golden West, and when
the master with a gesture of command
waves his hand and "the sound qf
hammers, blow on blow," is heard, one
girl will start the great mass of steel
down the ways and the other will speak
the name "Milwaukee."
San Jose Commandery No. 10 will en
tertain in a manner that will be cred
itable not only to San Joso, but cer
tainly will redound to the credit of the
whole State of California. The com
mandery has a membership of 150 Sir
Knishts, and they will come to the con
clave almost to a man. Their head
quarters will be at the Grand Hotel,
but the receptions and the entertain
ing will be at the Mechanics' Pavilion,
where a space of 140 by 2A feet has
been secured in the gallery. This is to
be fitted up with a garden effect, so
as to make it somewhat resemble the
home of the commandery, which is
known as the "Garden City" of Cali
fornia. 1 here will be lanes and vistas
and bowers made of palms, trees and
flowers. Another space will be re
served for a ladies' reception room and
an armory, leaving fully 100 feet for
display. The commandery will keep
open house and entertain every after
noon and evening during conclave
week. From fifty to 100 boxes of fruit
and several hundred baskets and
bunches ot flowers are to be given away
to visitors each day.
The following are prominent mem
bers of this commandery: Eminent
Commander W. G. Alexander, Albert
Harris, W. H. Haydock, \V. L. Wood

Smythe.

The Federal Grand Jury yesterday
returned a new indictment against
Thomas Davis, formerly indicted for
committing an assault' upon Mrs.
Emma Ames on the high seas on Oc
tober 17, 1903. Davis was tried sev
eral months ago in the United States
Circuit Court, and, although the Gov
ernment presented a convincing case,
the jury disagreed, some of the jurors
not thinking that the case wa3 strong
enough on which to base a verdict
calling for the death penalty, the only
penalty provided by the Federal statute
for the offense charged. The new in
dictment merely adds a second count,
charging an attempt at the crime,
which attempt is punishable with im
prisonment in the penitentiary for
thre years and a fine of S3000. The
trial has been set for next Monday.
Jury Will Be Allowed Some latitude
in Which to Evade fixing
Penalty of 'Death.

PERSONAL.
Charles F. Martin, secretary of the
National Livestock Association, said
to-day that this rate was the most sat
isfactory that had ever been granted
by the Transcontinental Passenger As
sociation and the promptness with
which it was made is exceedingly en
couraging to the officers of the asso
ciation, as it will no doubt insure a
very large attendance from the west
and northwest territory.
"The foregoing amounts added for
circuit covering Portland and San
Francisco, to accrue to lines south of
Portland.
"Limits: Tickets to be limited to
continuous passage going commencing
date of sale, with final return limit
thirty days and permit stop over re
turning within final limit. *
"Dates of sale to be determined by
Pacific Coast terminal lines."
"For tickets from North Pacific Coast
points, going direct, return via San
Francisco, rates to be $13 50 higher
than direct line rate.
"For tickets from San Francisco,
Tracy, Lathrop. Stockton, Redding and
points intermediate, going direct to
Denver, returning via Portland, rates
to be $13 50 higher than direct line rate.
For tickets from points south of San
Francisco, Tracy, Lathrop and Stock
ton, going direct, returning via Port
land, the usual arbitrary is to be added.
"This association will make a rate
from Pacific coast territory, to be one
thirty-day flrst-class fare for the round
trip via direct routes, usual diverse
routes to apply.
DENVER. Colo., Aug. 26.â In re
sponse to the request of the National
Livestock Association and the National
Wool Growers' Association for a rate
of one fare*for the round trip on the

which will be held in this city January
9 to 13 inclusive, the secretary of the
National Live Stock Association to
day received a letter from Chairman
James Charlton of the Transcontinent
al Passenger Association, which says:
The will revealed the secret and in
'dirated that more than $30,000 was be
queathed to a brother in Ireland and
$10,000 each to his two sisters, one liv
ing in Iowa and the other at TVymore,
Nebraska. Frank A. Harrison of Oma

Michael McCourt, a devout Catholic,
t took up his abode in a lonely hut on
the banks of Coopers Creek, near Table

solitary life as a religious recluse un
til last week, when death claimed him.
Neighbors found his wasted figure in
its last sleep on the barren floor.
A cearch revealed a Â¦will stored away

â¢ During: his lifetime little was known
of the o!d man's past. It was, however,

expected, would go to the church at
his death.

T1IKEK SIURDKRERS MAKE
GOOD THEIR ESCAPE
The police are searching for an aged
woman in black, who committed a
contemptible theft from a two-year
old boy on Thursday afternoon at Cal
ifornia and Broderick streets. They
have an accurate description of her
and expect to have her under arrest
soon. :
Mrs. J. A. Scrlbner of 1340 Pine
street stepped off a California-street
car at Devisadero street shortly after
2 o'clock. She had her little boy with
her and just as he left the car his hat
was blown off and rolled along the
street. Mrs. Scribner ran after the
hat, leaving her purse, containing $20,
with her little boy.
She recovered the hat and when she
returned to the boy he pointed to an
elderly woman, who was walking hur
riedly along Broderick street, and told
her in his childish way that she had
taken the purse. Mrs. Scribner fol
lowed the woman, who turned east on
Sacramento street and disappeared.
Mrs. Scribner reported the theft to the
police yesterday and gave a descrip
tion of the woman in black.

Ed Gibson arrived and took him into
custody. A dispatch was "sent "to
Louisville* and a reply was received
that there was no Phoenix distillery

As soon as the two women who fur

rest here they called^ at the Hall of
Justice and said they wanted to sur

any longer.
Henry Heller is again in trouble.
He was arrested in Los Angeles re
cently and brought to this city,
charged with selling barrels of whis

S300 cash bail furnished by two
women friends, but his- case has not

The California Methodist Annual
Conference, which meets at Pacific
Grove "September 14, will be asked to
return Dr. White to the pastorate of
the Central Methodist Episcopal
Church in this city. Dr. White, who
was formerly president of the Univer

for several years pastor of the Central
Church and his term having expired

A large percentage of the Municipal
Civil Service Employes' Association ex
press themselves as not being in favor
of all the proposed amendments to the
charter affecting the service of the city
employes, which will be submitted to
a vote of the people next November.
The amendments provide, in brief,
that all municipal offices be kept open
from 9 a, m. to i p. m.; that each em
ploye shall have two weeks' vacation
with pay and be given a half-holiday
with pay every Saturday. The Satur
day half-holiday is favored by most
of the employes, but it is the opinion
of some that the other two could be
dispensed with in order to insure the
success of the half-holiday proposition.
It Is the intention to have a bill in
troduced in the next Legislature pro
viding for a half-holiday In all public
offices on Saturdays. Even if a gen
eral law Is passed on the subject It
might be necessary to amend the char
ter in view of the constitutional pro
vision giving San Francisco and other
cities the right to govern themselves
in matters municipal.
At all events It looks as though some
of the municipal employes will be found
working for but one proposed amend
ment relating to the half-holiday, al
though some of the more
will urge the adoption of all the propo
sitions by the people.

The Dairymen's Association meets in
Sacramento on Tuesday, when the
matter of aggressive operations will be
taken up. E. F. Schulz, secretary of
the State Dairymen's Association, has
informed the California Promotion
Committee that the prospects are good
for a representative showing from his
association, which is the central organ
ization of dairymen, embracing eight
minor organizations throughout the
State.
Dairymen thro'ughotlt California will
make \a. strong effort to 1 have the na
tional butter-makers' convention of
1905 held in this State. As an argu
ment and an object lesson, the Cali
fornia Promotion Committee will send
a native-born cow to the, bufter
makers' convention at St. Louis in
October. .
.The animal will not be expected to
make any vocal argument, though It
has a healthy moo. Its sleek appear
ance, the committee thinks, will make
the Eastern butter-makers wonder
what sort of a cow paradise California
Is. .
I Betwen 6000 and 8000 delegates attend
the meetings of the National Butter
makers' Association, and if held in San
Francisco next year It will be the
largest agricujtural convention ever
brought to this State. In order to get
this convention, California dairymen
Intend to make a big show at St. Louis
when the national association meets.
A number of excursions have already
been planned to take 'Californians to
St. Louis. The California Creamery
Operators' Association will give an ex
cursion which will leave San Francisco
October 16, stopping en route at Salt
Lake City, Colorado Springs, Denver,
Lincoln, Omaha, St. Joseph and Kansas
City. It is expected that at least one
train will be made up from the Cali
fornia Creamery Operators' Associa
tion. Although the announcement of
the excursion has been but recently
made, the following have already sig
nified their intention of going:
At a recent meeting of the Labor
Council President Baufn offered a reso
lution denouncing Drinkhouse's meth
ods in foisting his cigars on the trades
people. This resolution was referred to
the executive committee of the coun
cil, which body made a careful inves
tigation of the allegations, summoning
the offender before it and hearing from
him his version and excuses for forc
ing the sale of the cigars of which he
Is the agent. "With him several whole-.
Eale cigar manufacturers were interro
gated regarding the charges of the
Cigarmakers' Union, all of whom sub
stantiated the charges. It was stated
that saloon men declined to come for
ward, fearing to incur the displeasure
of the Police Department, in whose
power their license is vested.
The result of the Investigation was
that th'e executive committee indorsed
the resolution of the Cigarmakers'
Union in recommending the removal of
Commissioner Drinkhouse. That the
action of the Labor Council may bear
fruit one section recommends that a
committee from the council wait on
Mayor Schmitz.
With the view of following up the
Issue while it Is hot, a copy of the
resolution will be presented to the
Building Trades Council at its next
meeting.
Several of the delegates stated that
It Is almost Impossible to obtain a
union cigar in any of the cigar stands
controlled by saloon-keepers. Accept
ing the views and the language of the
delegates It is a question "whether
Drinkhouse should control the cigar
business in this city by virtue of his
position as a Police Commissioner or,
whether the Cigarmakers' Union shall
go under." The vote of the members
of the council was unanimous.
After a short and snappish debate
the Labor Council decided last night
that Police Commissioner J. A. Drink
house is using "'moral intimidation" on
the saloon-keepers in this city to make
them patronize his cigars instead of
the International Blue Label brand.
William E. Slader, a gunner of the
Fifth Battalion, field artillery U. S. A..
was badly hurt while the artillery was
out for drill. Captain John L. Hayden
â¢was in command. They were at the
south end of the big camp field and
were just starting into the country,
when the guidon carried by one of
the sergeants, in some unaccountable
way. struck a pole which was sup
porting the telegraph wire of the sig
nal service corps, knocking It down.
As the wire fell it caught Slader under
the chin and threw him with great force
from his seat directly under the wheels
of the caisson, which passed over his
bead and legs. He was taken to the
general field hospital. His injuries are
Ferious and painful, but not danger
ous. That he was not killed instantly
seems to have been almost a miracle.
General MacArthur made farewell
official calls on the different United
States army organizations remaining
in camp here. He left his headquar
ters at 5 o'clock in the signal corps
auto, accompanied by Major West,
Captain Wlnn and Colonel S. P. Joce
lyn. He first called on the officers of
the First Brigade, Colonel A. C. Mark
ley commanding, who were assembled
at the headquarters of the provisional
regiment. He next vlsltetl the officers
of the Second Brigade, Colonel H. C.
Ward commanding. His final call was
on the officers of divisional cavalry,
divisional artillery, divisional hospital
and divisional signal corps at the cav-
ATASCADERO. Aug. 26.â The pro
visional division at this camp is now
a thing of the past. ThÂ« booming of
the cannon at 6 o'clock to-night, while
the band pleyed "The Star-Spangled
Banner,", announced that the division
v.2s dissolved.
The big maneuvers are closed and
r.oT\\ as fast as practicable, the troops
v. ill so to the!r home posts.
Both General MacArthur and Gen
eral Lauck are pleased at the outcome.
These were the sentiments expressed
l&st night at a meeting held here In
the assembly tent at which all the of
f.icers of both the regulars and militia
were present. General MacArthur pre
sided. While the militia thought the
work imposed upon them at the start
whs too rtrenuous, they find that they
have learned many object lessons and
they leave the scene o-f the greatest
combined maneuvers of both forces
that has ever taken place on this coast
in splendid spirits, fine health and with
a marvelously increased knowledge of
what a real United States military
camp is like.
The great camp field looks like a
deserted village. Only a few piles of
firewood and a lot of scattered straw
remain to mark the spot where at sun
lise this morning nearly 3000 troops
encamped. At daybreak the men
commenced to pull up stakes and each
organization marched out of camp on
exactly schedule time. On arrival at
Atascadero station they found that
Colonel \V. S. Patton had their respec
tive trains awaiting them, which they
ct once boarded and steamed away to
their different home stations. The ar
rangements were so perfect that some
of the troops were settled in the cars
and ready for departure before the an
nounced time. The first train departed
at 8 a. m. and the last at 5 p. m. Not
an accident happened to mar the en
training. There were eight trains, con
t-iFting of sixty-eight passenger cars
and thirty-eight baggage cars, besides
tars for 250 animal?. As the different
regiments left the camp their bands
j'luyed patriotic airs and festive
inarches. The Second Regiment was
the first to leave and as that organiza
tion went by headquarters the band
l>!ayed "Au!d Lang Syne."

Mrs. Jennie ' Gilmore stepped out, of
the Branch County Jail, where she had
served three months for disturbing the
peace, to find her lifelong friend,, Mrs.
John Prior and six other men were
playing "tappa," an Italian game of
chance, when they were arrested for
gambling, and as nobody connected
with the prosecution seemed able to
tell how the game was played Judge
Cabaniss continued the case until fur
ther information on that point can
be obtained.
Seventeen-year-old George Roach,
who was found asleep in a Southern
Pacific freight car, pleaded that his
intent was not larcenous, as he had
stolen a ride Jn the car from San Jose
and was nabbed before; he could get
out. By request of the Southern Paci
fic's attorney the charge of burglary
was dismissed.
â¢ â¢ â¢
J. B. Gilmore was charged with bur
glary by the policeman who found him
asleep In a North Beach warehouse,
but as no plunder was found in his
possession ar.d there was no evidence
that he had forced an entrance, it
looked like dismissal for him, when he
suddenly expressed a desire to plead
guilty to disturbing the peace. His
offer was promptly accepted and he got
thirty days.
â¢ . â¢ â¢
George Henry was arrested five times
within as many weeks for selling lot
tery tickets at 907 Market street, and
each time he was fined $40. "If you
come back here on a similar charge it
will cost you more than $40," said Ca
baniss, "for the thing is becoming mo
notonous to me."
John Wilson, who committed bur
glary at Berkeley and 6old his plun
der in San Francisco, _ was sent to
the Superior Court by Judge Cabaniss,
with bail fixed at $2000.
"I can't do that," said the Judge,
"but at the expiration of thirty days
she can be sent to the Almshouse."
"I will see to it that she goes there,"
said the officer.
Â¦'The clothes these women claim 1
tried to steal were my own that I
brought from San Jose," she Insisted.
Patrolman Lambert said the old
woman was so strongly imbued with
the petty larceny habit that she could
not pass anything portable without en
deavoring to steal it. Her specialty
was "swiping" domestic utensils from
back yards, but if she saw an open
door she could not resist the temptation
to enter and explore. Her pilferings
were usually, of such light value, and
her destitution so apparent, that her
victims seldom had her arrested. But
it would be a good thing for the woman
herself, as well as for the community
at large, the policeman said, if she
were sent to jail for the remainder of
her days. *
Sixty years of age and a confirmed
kleptomaniac, Mrs. Theresa Farrell was
sentenced to thirty days' imprison
ment by Police Judge' Cabaniss after
she had informed him that she was
homeless. She stole clothing from Mrs.
Frederickson of 14 Godus street and
Mrs. Margaret McCarthy of 216 Pros
pect avenue, but stoutly denied both
accusations.
Mrs. Frederickson testified that she
met the defendant as she was coming
out of a room in her house with a silk
skirt and other garments in her pos
session. Mrs. McCarthy swore that
when she caught the defendant in the
act of plundering her house she had
to apply physical force to get back her
property. Despite these unequivocal
charges the defendant declared that
she never even coveted her neighbor's
goods, much less attempt to steal
them.
Gustav Scherf, the deputy pound
master who shot and killed Rudolph
W. Schultze last Wednesday at South
San Francisco, spent a - very uncom
fortable quarter of an hour yesterday
morning in the courtroom of Police
Judge Cabaniss, where he was ar
raigned on the murder complaint filed
by his victim's brother. There was
palpable dread in the furtive glances
he shot from time^o'time at the throng
that filled every available inch of
standing room and stared at him with
expressions in which there was little
or no sympathy. During the formal
arraignment his mind Â«emed to be
concentrated upon the demeanor of thfe
crowd instead of the words that meant
so much to him. A lonely figure he
was, neither attorney nor friehd being
there to speak to him or for him. He
said he had not made any arrangement
to engage counsel, and the Judge sug
gested that he. communicate with his
family or friends and get legal assist
ance.
After the arraignment the prelim
inary examination was continued till
next Thursday, by which time a Coro
ner's jury will have investigated the
killing of Schultze. As the defendant
was led back to the prison the crowd
surged out ahead of him, and from
courtroom to elevator he walked be
tween living walls. But no deed/ of
violence was attempted nor intemper
ate word uttered.
Margaret. Galvln was exactly seven
hours out of Jail, where she had spent
a month for. drunkenness, when a po
liceman found her, intoxicated and in
capable of walking. In police circles
she Is Known aa -"the aristocratic
drunk," because she has rear and per
sonal property of value and keeps a
maid.
"You. might as well fine me and. let
me go," she Baid to Judge .Cabaniss,
"for sending me to Jail only serves to
keep me sober while I'm there, and the
city might as well profit by my mis
fortune." ,
"Your philosophy is patriotic," said
his Honor, "and I guess I'll make it
$10 this time."
She paid the money on the spot.
â¢ ' â¢ â¢
Clark Jayne, convicted of stealing $5
from John Cunningham, was sent to
the Superior Court by Judge Fritz,
with bail fixed at 52000.
Kitty Wilson, awaiting her with oral
and liquefied solace, the latter contained
in a pocket flask. Together the ladies
started to walk to the city's center,
and as confinement in the prison had
impaired Mrs.'' Gilmore's pedestrian
prowess to some' extent she occasion
ally dropped into a saloon, accom
panied by herl faithful crony, to rest.
That's how both of them happened to
be placed; under, arrest for. drunken
ness and .fighting: before they, arrived
at^their destination. The. policeman
found them 'locked in embrace and
when he split them asunder the face
of each trickled' gore from/ sundry
scratches made by finger nails. Mrs.
Gilmore told Judge Cabaniss that Mrs.
Wilson was entirely to blame for the
encounter, but his Honor sent her back
to the "Branch" for thirty days and
discharged her; sister defendant. "

The commission of engineers of the
River and Drainage Association was
again in session at the Flood building
yesterday morning. A. Boschke, for
merly assistant engineer under State
Engineer Hall's administration, sub
mitted plans for controlling the flood
waters of the Sacramento and Old riv
ers. He maintained that by cutting a
canal at Coles Bend and diverting the
surplus water through the basin to the
west of the Sacramento the flooding
of lands in the vicinity of Grand Island
would be prevented.
W. S. Smith, a land owner at Grand
Island, occupied the rest of the morn
ing explaining the conditions on Old
River and Steamboat Slough. Smith
advocated a canal cut from the Sacra
mento River, belo'w where the Old river
ends, through the Montezuma Hills to
Suisun Bay to accommodate the over
flow. He did not think that it would
be expensive, as the cut would not have
to be very deep to accommodate the
surplus water. This work, he thought,
shotfld be paid for by the State.
In answer to Major Dabney's ques
tion as to whether the landowners on
Old River would object to water be
ing carried away from them by open
ing up Steamboat Slough, Smith
thought they would not. He maintained
that Old River was the legitimate con
tinuation of the Sacramento and that
by the constant wash from river steam
ers the point of land at the mouth of
Steamboat Slough had been "worn away
and the sand had piled up at the
mouth, blocking the channel. He
thought, however, that the flow through
Georgiana Slough should be cut off.
The. levees raised to keep back the
floods from Grand Island, he said,
were constructed of sand, and to pre
vent the wind from blowing them away
a rather costly process of oiling them
was adopted. Grasses, have been
planted on the levees and these, it is
hoped, will In time do away with the
necessity for oiling. Â¦ , Â¦ -
William Muir submitted a paper to
the commission, but It was not read
at the meeting. The. hearing goes on
to-day at 10 o'clock and the session
will be continued for several days.
Earl Cummings, the newly appoint
ed member of the Park Commission,
met with the board yesterday in the
olflce of Commissioner R. H. Lloyd.
His intro&uction was in the matter of
a new park seal. The design chosen
by the board was a representation of
the Claus Spreckels grand music
stand". Mr. Cummings was asked to
exercise his artistic tastes on the pic
ture.
A communication was received from
Supervisor Fay calling 1 the attention
of the Board of Park Commissioners
to the city and county ordinance re
lating to keeping the ocean beach part
of the park clear of rubbish and gam
blers. The sanitary machinery of the
commission will be put to work Im
mediately.
' The board decided not to open the
approach of Forty-ninth street to the
park until that thoroughfare has been
paved. The Board of Fire Commis
sioners was tendered a vote of thanks
for 200 feet of condemned hose. While
this t hose is too weak for the great
pressure of lire work it can be used
in the park for years. Many rare ar
ticles were given to the museum.
Commissioner Lloyd spoke of the
inscription to be cut on the new stone
gateway at the Haight-street entrance
and mentioned that all he could save
from the wreck of the McCauley lit
igation for this gateway was $2300.
"When Mrs. William A. McCauley
four years ago," said Mr. Lloyd, '"in
her will left 'the residue* of her estate
for this purpose she fondly thought
that Golden Gate Park would get a
$20,000 entrance, but after the prop
erty had weathered the Superior and
Supreme courts there was just $2300."
\ "1 can't say what lawyer got the
lost coin," said Mr. Lloyd in reply to
a question of one of his brother Com
missioners.

WASHINGTON. Aug. 26.â John Bur
ley, a negro, was hanged, here to-day

arraignment of the prisoner and tha
crime for which he was convicted.

"CONSTANCE/' By D. S. W. Richtcr. i
The first subject selected could with difficulty be recognized by the
halftone above on account of the impossibility of showing the exquisite
coloring of the original by this process. .
Copies of this picture, which is to be given away next Sunday, are dis-
played in prominent places throughout the city. Don't fail toÂ»see one. \
"Constance" represents a rare and delicate type of beauty. The calm, '
pure expression of her face is enlivened by the beautiful flesh tints and 1
strengthened by the bits of contrasting colors brought out by the arrange-
ment of the apple blossoms in her dark hair. ]
This study : s a most careful reproduction of Mr. Richter's celebrated i
original, and is regarded as one of the best of this famous artist's paint- j

Continued on Fa;e Fourteen.
I Corn opened fractionally under the previous
close, chiefly because cf the weakness of ca
bles. September opened unchanged to 4c up
at 524c to 53c. December was down iiÂ©t,c
to at 51 Uc to SIVic. September touched
S3*ie and December 524c. The cloae was
flrm at 53 He and 51 %c for September and
December, respectively.
Oats In a general way followed the course
of the corn market, although trading was
without distinguishing feature and price
changes were within a very narrow range.
September started h%c to 4c lower at 32 \i c to
32%c. dipped to 32c. rallied to 32%c and closed
at 32% c. December opened unchanged to He

CHICAGO, Aug. 26. â Wheat was extremely
nervous throughout the session to-day. Sep
tember started 4c to 14c down at $1 024Â®
C*l 034. December waa Â»ie%c to 1M<&
1-V.c off at $1 04 to $1 044. The . weakness
was attributed largely to the non-appearance
of frosts in the Northwest and to heavy Ar
gentine shipments. A disposition to take prof
its vu shown by outsiders, who had bought
wheat under the dollar mark. Several of
the leading bulls, however, were . reported
to hava comÂ« to the support of thÂ» market.
The alleged operations resulted tn rather eager
plunge* to the buying side. The reversion of
feeling was helped by private advices, which.
If true. Indicated more emphatically that the
Manitoba crop will be considerably shorter
than that of last year. The Northwest bought
In this market on the strength of the short
age news. As a result frightened shorts began
to cover their lines. In a few minutes Sep
tember wheat advanced 1% to $1 0S*4 and
December 3c to $1 0C4. The trade seemingly
lÂ« rapidly getting out of the nearer month, and
the deferred future received the ffreater atten
tion. Renewed profit taking resulted in a sud
den decline. Soon September was back to
$1 04*4 and December to $1 05%. At these
prices another bull wave overtook the market,
and the best prices of the day were recorded.
The strength attending the last reaction con
tinued until the close, final quotations being
at the top, $1 C5Ti for September and $1 07^4
for December.

WHEATâ Liverpool futures were higher.
The Paris Petit Journal says that the wheat
crop ia proving deceptive-, and although not
likely to be so deficient as some authorities
affirm will be largely, short of last year's
abundance; the excellent quality and the etoeks
of old wheat on hand, however, will probably
render France again practically independent
of foreign wheat.
Chicago declined from $1 W to $1 02T4 and
closed at |1 05%. The trade were bearish
and all bands were ! working to get prices
down, but werÂ« unsuccessful, owing to con
tinued bad reports from the Northwest.
The Chicago Inter Ocean says: "A lit
tle history on the wheat crop of the North
west Is not out of place at present, omnj
to the calamitous reports coming from there. ;
The Northwestern people In somÂ« Instances
have the crop down to lOO.OCO.OOO bmhals.
The milling capacity' of the Northwest Is
about 15O.0C0.0OO bushels. In 1894. just ten
years ago, the thre* States only raised 86,
000,000 bushels. The average yield ->er acre
of the three Northwestern States waa from
12 to 15 bushels. The talk of smajl yields
this â¢ year is no wore* than the threshing re
turns last year."
In thi3 market futures were quiet, but 14 c
higher, and the cash grain recovered the
ground lost several days ago.

John Whelden. the three and a
half months old son of Mr. and Mrs.
Edward Whelden of 1576 Turk street,
was taken suddenly yesterday morn
ing with convulsions and died within
a few minutes thereafter. The infant
was asleep on a pillow on a lounge
and at 9:45 a. m. the attention of
Mrs. Whelden was attracted by a
gurgling and choking sound. She
looked toward the infant and saw that
it was black in the face and that its
little hands were twitching. Snatch
ing it In her arms, she ran to Poeh
ner's drug store, corner of Pierce and
Turk streets, half a block away. When
she reached the store the baby was
dead. . v .
Mrs. Whelden was of the impression
that the child may have picked up a
button and swallowed it. The autopsy
by Morgue Surgeon Bacigalupi showed
that there was.no foreign body pres
ent in or near the windpipe of the
child.

nesses examined were Dr. George H.
Martin, Corporal George W. Russell,
Captain W. J. Peterson and Policeman
H. E. Green of Oakland; Miss Nora,
Kennealy, Mrs. Minnie L. Whitney
and Dr. Bacigalupi.
The District Attorney offered to read
the testimony of Mrs. Coit taken at
the preliminary hearing before Police
Judge Fritz, but Attorney George D.
Collins objected on technical grounds.
The Judge held that sufficient evidence
had been adduced to satisfy the court
that Mrs. Coit was not within the juris
diction of the court, but he wanted to
hear from counsel as to the other ob
jections. As Judge Fritz is sick and
S. Bloom, his court stenographer, failed
to appear, the case was continued until
Monday morning.
Rev. Edward Bently Church was for
years grand chaplain of California
Commander)', Knights Templar.
Rev. .Edward Bently Church, founder
of Irving Institute and a prominent
Knight Templar, died at Pasadena yes
terday. The clergyman-schoolmaster
had retired from active life two years
ago, his health having been broken by
overwork.
Dr. Church was born in Greenville,
Mo., September 4, 1844. He came to
California in 1S69, where he soon be
came prominent as an educator. He
was principal and instructor in several
private schools.
In 1S81 Church founded the Irving
Institute in this city. This institution
is one of the best known schools for
girls in the country. Though his work
as an educator was enough to keep an
ordinary man busy, he found time to
attend to his clerical duties besides.
He was once assistant at' Trinity
Church and afterward of St. Luke's.
This zealous activity culminated in a
collapse two years ago and Church was
compelled to resign his position at the
institute.
Since that time he has been livfng
quietly at Pasadena. There he con
tracted pneumonia a few days ago. His
system, overtaxed by the active life he
had led, could not withstand the dis
ease.
The management of the Irving Insti
tute he turned over to Mr. and Mrs.
George H. Kellogg when he retired.
They will continue to conduct it.

THE REV. EDWARD BENTLEY
CHURCH WHO DIED YESTER
DAY AT PASADENA.
Upon this view the Judge decided to
hear arguments next Monday, when
he will probably settle, the question of
the deposition and set the trial for
hearing.
Judge Coffey said the only question
was as to whether Miss Warren's con
dition is such as to make an order to
proceed with her testimony proper. If
the doctor was to be believed the ac
tion might be perilous to her health,
and he did not believe the contestants
would care to drive . her out of her
mind.
Mrs. Adeline Copeland, a notary,
testified that she had been called to
Mr. Pillsbury's office to verify Miss
Warren's answer to the Schander con
test. She said that Miss Warren "was
pallid, nervous and unfit." When
asked to explain her statement she de
clared that "it is difficult to make a
man understand a woman's condition
In that shape."
C. Barretta, a jeweler, testified that
Miss Warren and another woman
came to his establishment on August
13 and 16 and made purchases of
jewelry.
Sam Valenzuela, the last witness, af
forded some insight as to methods in
serving summons and some amuse
ment in his explanations. He said he
went to Miss Warren's house with a
summons for her to appear, before a
â¢notary. He wore a messenger's cap,
unlettered, however, and when the
nurse came to the door said that he
"had a message which he must give
Mi.-s Warren personally." She came
downstairs, dressed in black, and he
handed her the summons.
This evidence seemed to interest
Judge Coffey and he questioned the
young man at length. The boy said
he was in the business of serving sum
monses in difficult cases. He" admitted
that he frequently used disguises and
said: "When I go to those rich houses
the nurse always answers the door and
I have to look like a messenger to
get next."
The answer raised a laugh. When
the Judge asked the boy if he was em
ployed by any company, he replied
that he had a company of his .own.
At the end of the examination At
torney Pillsbury renewed his motion
that the case be set for trial. Hiram
Johnson asked that all the evidence
and the affidavits heretofore submitted
be considered by the court. Albert
Johnson asked the court to order Miss
Warren to show cause why she. should
not be punished for contempt and re
quire her to give a deposition.
DEFENSE DOESXT NEED, HER.
Mr. Pillsbury suggested that the ad
ministrators would go to trial without
Miss Warren's presence, and Mr.
Johnson retorted that such a proceed
ing would indeed be "inhuman," con
sidering that the executors were de
fending her interests as the chief resi
duary legatee of the estate.
Dr. Lewitt first visited Miss Warren
on August 8 and between the 3d and
that date he did not know of any one
having attended her. He said she was
suffering from the effects of the
shock. She is evidently much better,
but her mental condition is such that
a severe strain might bring on col
lapse. Her nervous system is upset
and will probably continue so for sev
eral weeks. The doctor thought she
might stand a short examination if it
were not exciting, but he was not in
clined to say that she might appear
in court under a few weeks, nor ap
pear in a private office for a deposition,
in which the cross-examination might
txcite her.
Hiram Johnson cross-examined Dr.
Lewitt and learned that he had ad
vised Miss Warren to take as much
daily exercise as possible and that he
knew she had made trips downtown,
accompanied by her nurse. It was
brought out, on the admission of At
torney Pillsbury, that Miss Warren
had visited his office twice.
NERVOUS AND UNFIT.
SUFFERS FROM SHOCK!
Â«. witness of Bertha Dolbeer's dreadful
death. Ho was acting for Dr. Lewitt,
who was absent. Miss Warren was in
a nervous condition, but continued to
improve until August 3, when he
ceased his visits.
Three points were involved in the
hearing before Judge Coffeyâ the
physical and mental condition of Etta
Warren, the demand of the Schander
side that her deposition be taken be
fore the case is set for trial and the
insistence of the attorneys of the ad
ministrators that the trial be set for
an early date.
After the examination Judge Coffey
said he would hear arguments on
Monday afternoon. He intimated that
he might deal more directly upon the
illness if the person involved were a
man. but under the circumstances he
had to believe the testimony of the
woman's physician.
Dr. C. C. Wadsworth was the first
witness. He attended Miss Warren
and was present at the time she ar
rived from New York, where she was
Etta Marion Warren's physical
health is "fair," according to the ex
pert testimony of her physician, Dr.
Yi\ B. Lewitt, given in Judge Coffey's
court yesterday morning. To outward
appearances an ordinary person might
say that the woman who has left the
major portion of Bertha M. Dolbeer's
fortune is enjoying perfect health.
But Dr. lewitt says his patient is
recovering from a nervous shock and
that the ordea" of an appearance "in
court or bofore a notary for a depo
sition might cause a collapse.
The trial of Alexander B. Garriett,
charged with the murder of fcjajor J.
"W. McClung in the Palace Hotel on
November 25, was continued before a
jury in Judge Lawlor's court yester
day afternoon. The defendant did not
seem to take much interest in the pro
ceedings.
A large part of the session was taken
up by District Attorney Byington's
opening address to the jury. In suc
cinct fashion and without attempt at
oratory he recalled the principal de
tails of the crime and outlined the
State's case against Garnett.
District Attorney Byington said that
Mrs. Lillian $1. Colt occupied rooms
in the . Palace Hotel and was ac
quainted with the defendant, who fre
quently visited her. Ten days prior to
| November 25 Garnett and Mrs. Coit
had a* dispute while playing bridge
whist in her rooms. He made use of
vulgar language and she told him to
leave, as she would have nothing fur
ther to do with him. He wrote her
'several notes, tendering an apology,
but she did not reply.
About 4 o'clock in the afternoon of
November 25 . Major McClung called
upon Mrs. Coit and in a few minutes
Garnett appeared in the doorway. Mrs.
Coit told him to leave the room, and
Garnett said to McClung: "Major, leave
the room."
Mrs. Coit asked McClung not to leave,
and Garnett said: "Major, leave the
room; I came to see this lady."
Garnett drew a pistol from his pocket
and advanced toward Mrs. Coit. Mc-
Clung seized "Garnett's uplifted arm
and was shot by Garnett.
McClung said, "I am desperately
wounded," and Gsrnett said to Mrs.
Coit:" "Woman, I have come for an
apology and I mean to shoot you."
She begged him not to kill her, tell
ing him to remember what her mother
had done for him. He retorted that
he had done as much for her. Mrs.
Coit went to the telephone and Gar
nett followed her and prevented her
from using it. Mrs. Coit again begged
him not to shoot her, and he said:
"Well. I have killed McClung, but I
won't kill you."
Garnett left the room and went to
Mrs. Whitney's room, telling her he
had shot* McClung. Miss Nora Ken
nealy, a servant, called Dr. Martin,
who found McClung lying on a lounge.
McClung died the following day.
After making his statement the Dis
trict [Attorney called the following wit
nesses to prove that Mrs. Coit was not
within the jurisdiction of the court,
so that her testimony, taken at the
preliminary hearing, could be read to
the jury: Detective T. L. Ryan, I. W.
Hellman Jr., Captain J. B. Martin, At
torney H. W. Bradley and Richard A.
