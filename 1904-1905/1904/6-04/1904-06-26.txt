J, he was the editor of the Eugene Demo

tlce of law, which did not please him,
he went to London in l$St>, and it was
here that his first book of ; poems .was
'published and met- with instant^iavor.
Then followed several Â¦ years" of news

1S87 he has been a constant resident'of*
Oakland, living, for the. most of
time in his picturesque home on the

wondered very much and could not 'see
the difference. â¢ " . ; .
â¢ "Papa, what Is the soul, anyhow ?",
Malke asked her father with a pensive
air. I
"A soul is that part of godliness,"
explained her father, "that every Jew
possesses."
'"Has not a gentile that part of god
liness in him, father?" asked the girl
again.
"This is too deep for you to under
stand, my child," responded Mr Ta
kiff, and puffed at his pipe. "You're a
girl, and a woman's brain is not able
to comprehend such serious -problems.
A Jew whose soul was present on
Mount Sinai when the Torah was given
to Israel, as the Talmud says, has got
that part of godliness because he- an-'
swered: 'All that the Lord spoke we
will do and hear.' "
This explanation did not seem to
satisfy Malke. "Will not the gentiles
have gan-eden (heaven), father?" she
resumed. "Not even Count LosJInaki,
who is so good to every one and favors
the Jewish people in particular?"
"Oh. yes, my daughter. The Talmud
also says:#All good gentiles will have
the world to come. In heaven all will
be Jews.' "
"It will be so nice," laughed Malke.
"All will be alike and there will be no
more Jews and gentiles, but all the
same, and the Jews will be permitted
to own land in their own names, like
the gentiles, and will be allowed to
live everywhere, even in St. Peters
burg and Moscow."
"Oh, you fool!" interrupted her little
brother. "In gan-eden all the noble
men will make fire in Jewish houses
and snuff the candles on Shabbos. And
Vanka, who' calls me Christ-killer, will
carry mama's prayer-book to the syna
gogue on Shabbos. It will be so nice!"

ready bore the yoke of. the Torah,
clapped his wee hands' and danced

CHAPTER XXII.
A PROPOSAL. OF MARRIAGE.
. Mrs. Takiff often sighed because Mal
kele, as she fondly called her daughter,
was already going on eighteen and
there was 'Nothing: suitable'' for her.
Shadchonin. (marriage . . brokers) , pro
posed many bridegrooms, and each, one
whispered to Rob Nosen. (as they ad
dressed him) that he had the 'very best
article in the market. But! none quite
satisfied the . innkeeper. .As , for Malke,
who of course, was ;â¢ -never ' consulted
when the; merits of 'the various candi

'=}Â¦ One afternoon at the end*of August
we were in the sitiing-ron^m^Mr. Takiff
in his bfg armchair before an open win-,
dow, puffing at his long pipe,: Mrs. Ta-'
v'klff mending a stocking, Malke work
_'lng over a piece/of embroidery, and I
scajmlng th,r pages of a Russian book
â when Koppel the rhadchan,. who had
taken a keen interest in Malke's future,
appeared before the window at which
Mr. Takiff sat. â¢ ' ; ' '-.
"Good afternoon, Reb Nosen," ,he
said, with his indolent, oily smile on his
face.
"Sholom . Aleichem," returned Mr.
Takiff, offering his hand through the
open wfndow. "How do you come here
at this time of the day?"
- "What a questionâ ha! ha! ha! ha!"
The shadchan's laugh was dry and
cackling. "Isn't a person allowed to
pay you a visit? When one has mer
chandise he. should not clrfse the door'
against a prospective purchaser." And
winking significantly he cackled again.
.""Well, Reb Koppel, well," rejoined
Mr. Takiff somewhat eagerly, "any
thing new?" . .-;
"Sure, indeed, Reb Nosen. The very
article you are looking for Js at hand,
and one to -suitâ I should rather say'
becoming â an Honorable Jew like Reb
Nosen .Takiff. Well:'â spreading his
armsâ '.'a young man who is a rarity I

myself; and my- wife said the very v
same/'lhls goldfish-must go to no one

"Well, well, come into the house and
let me hear what jyou' have tq,.Â«ay."
The shadchan" disappeared from the'
window and a moment later was. with
us In the sitting-room. 'He had an'ex
tlngulshed corn-cob pipe in' his mouth,
and he playfully swung a gnarled cane
between his'<" Ihuihb and? forefinger, I
which" were yellow' from the tobacco .he
snuffed. He 'was a man of medhjm
size, with a weazenefl" head, which he J
carried bent slightly* forward and -to
one side. His eyes, set in their
sockets, were overhung by shaggy eye
brows, his beard, though . was
broad and long,- and his,' pells, fell to â¢
his shoulders. S He ( wore 'a long ; caftan, :

blessed be his name! â help me to ac
complish my undertaking In a happy
hour. Of course you know Rabbi Brill
of Javolin; he told me that the young
man is a shining star in Israel whose
brilliancy will illumine our holy people
in exile. As to his-, personal beauty" â
here he shrugged his shoulders and
made a motion with his hands as If to
drive away an Imaginary opponent â
"he looks like an angel. God's grace
rests upon him. Tall, majestic, and in
his white and crimson face there is the
reflection of .angels, so may the Lord
send a blessing wherever I turn.". .
â¢ He paused for a moment tor.wipe the
perspiration from his forehead. Nosen
Takiff nodded hia head In silent ap
proval. - ...
"As to the dowry," ..the shadchan
continued,' "we have little to say. Ha
has been offered ten thousand and fif
teen thousand, rubles, but of course to
an aristocrat like Reb Nosen â well, he
would go for a little less. I believe you
once told me that you were willing to
give your daughter six thousand ru

gem you will- not mind to add two

what I call a bargain -which could not
be had by the richest of our brethren-
Why, did you never hear of the Javo

ishment at Mr. Takiff that the latter
blushed at his own ignorance.
"So- may the holy one â blessed be he!
âhelp me find suitors for my owp mar
riageable daughters â even babes. have

Young fellows like you must not listen
to talk of marriage;" this with his oily
smile. "When you will be ripe. enough
I'll get you a nice girl -with a big
dowry." . ,'-. ':' ' .
With my heart throbbing painfully
over what I had heard I went Into the
dining-room. There I found ..Malke,
pale and apprehensive, j pretending to
read a book. I thought I detected the
sign of fresh tears on her cheeks. ;v .
In about an hour Mr. Takiff came.in
to the room where we sat. sniilins
blissfully. "My daughter," he an
nounced, "next Friday 'your intended
one" is going to stay Shabbos with us."
Malke did'not utter a word, but her
beautiful face changed color, a few
tears trickled down her cheeks, and
the bock in her .hand slipped to the
floor. "Oh, Israel," I am so unhappyâ
so 1 unhappy!" she. whispered, and
without givins me a chance tec reply
she slipped away to her bedroom.

MÂ»!ke Â«>pcr.rd the window of her
:hcmber and thrust '>ut her head. Her
tyvn were only half oper., and the mist
ri f sleep was still hc-vering over her
face.
"Why did you get up so early?" she
rs-lced me. ard faintly blushing as she
navtrtd her partly- exposed bosom with
her B&ked hand.
I raised my eves to hers, and behold
in? her head. 'resting between her
hards, her luxuriant hair hanging
down her bare neck like a loosened
?kein of ri'k. her rising and falling
br*>ar^ between her arms, I faltered
shyly, "Ah. it is so beautiful:" and I
spread my arms and dropped them in
des- pair.
She smiled, blushed and lowering her
head she r.Eked me to pluck a violet
for "her. v
I was delighted to obey her. to be
of fnme service to her, to please every
v.him and fancy of hers. â¢ â¢
As I handed the flower to her she
brr.t forward through the open win
dow, ar.d Fr.-.elling the violet she mur
mured. "What a deliciL-us fragrance!"
BQd glanced blushing!y at my face
with a charming twinkle in .her eyes.
Fhe remained leaning on the win
dow sdll and staring in front of her
meditatively. whi!e I gazed and gazed
at her fa'e 'hat spoke of unsatiable
life, youth, passion, beauty. The gar
den with those many trees and shrubs

dar.t: earth, the delicious air, the
bloomirg mr.iden with that wondering
puze of hersâ ah! Nature In all her
pplcnflor and supreme beauty stc-od b%
fore -me.
She again glanced at me. with a sad
srni!Â» playing around her lips, and with
what I thought teasing mockery she
said in a very low tone, ".Â»h. It is so
beautiful!" and her pretty head dis
appeared.
I threw myself upon the ground with
the book clasped to my breast, and
locked list'.essly at the bits of sky
screened by the branches above me.
In my heart I felt a longing mixed
with venom. She was so near to me.
and yet her confidence in me, her
frankness, her calmness, her self-pos
session in my presence, Indicated the
distance between us.
Thus passed the summer In a state
of doubt and despair. Malke grew
Tmore and. j more absent-minded and
melancholy. She frequently spoke to
me of her lack of friends, of the monot
ony Vf her life, and expressed a long
ing to visit theaters and -attend balls
as did thÂ« ladies of big cities.
One.<fay she asked abruptly: "Israel,
is it such a great sin to marry a gen
tile? Magdeline Grubovskl, the sur
vcyor's.daoghter, says she would mar
ry a Jew if she only loved him, and
the ts a Christian. Why should it be
a greater sin for a Jew to marry a
Christian?"
I ceuld give no definite answer to
this, so I said nothing. Then she re-
Kumed: "I ilke Magdeline so much.
She has parties and balls, and oh I
what nice, gallant gentlemen come to
her! 1 have been Invited many times,
but I do not like to go there because
the young men call me 'pretty Jewess.'

with me than with Magdeline. But they
are so pleasant, eo polite. Isn't Count

he said to fatherâ In a Joke, of course
that if he could get a girl like me "
Here she burst into feigned laughter
and covered her blushing face, .with
. both hands. "Isn't It n:ce of him. to
say that? He's a count and owns this
village and the next, and what a pal
ace he has! - Think of his marrying. a
plain Jewish girl â Why do yon keep
ko quiet, Israel?" 'she asked abruptly.

Fpeak of Count Losjinski. You're a

tdded, emphasizing every syllable by
stroking my chin in a playful manner
and laughing sweetly. How little I
understood the world or even myself! I
did not know that there Is something
deeper In words than the mere mean
ing of them; that things spoken- are

eyes. I bowed my head,, and there
came upon me a burning, realization of
the - meaning this-"perio*d j ; of self
denialâthis day which , has-been- eter
nized Jn , Jewish memory by ; fire and
blood; ,the" day- which , cost the down
trodden' Israelite the lives of ; his inno

daughters; the day on which. the eter-
quietude. All rose with faces uplifted.
The silence grew deeper; nothing but
tho soft tread of shoeless feet was
heard; these were the footsteps of .the
seven white-bearded elders of the con
gregation. The snow-white " curtain
overhanging the oren-kodesh was
drawn aside; the portals were opened.
At sight of tUls there came a look of
awe in j every countenance. Each of
the 1 elders took out a""scroll of the
Tc-rah, kissed it, and holding' it to his
breast marched to the altar, where the
seven formed a ring. Breathing almost
stoppedâ it was a moment too reveren
tial for tears, too solemn for prayer.
The choir waited for. the sexton's sig
nal; the sexton waited for a 'motion
from the rabbi. At length the signal
came/ The -leader of the choir gave a
faint cough to clear his throat, and in a
tremulous minor key began the quaint,

groaned and moaned and wept." The

of a dam. ~ ..

gogue all night, reciting prayers and
chanting hymns... When I returned the
next morning they were still praying
and crying and .beating their, breasts.
The reeky smell of socks mingled with
the foul odor of hundreds of smoking
tallow and wax candles. Mr. Takiff's
candle, which stood In the recess of the
window nearest him, was already ex
tinguished, and a long piece of burned
Â¦ wick, fell 'over" one side, where the wax
had melted away.' He regarded this as
a "bad omen and was perturbed. Mrs.
Takiff extende(J..her head from the wo
men's gallery and gazed at the extin
guished ., candle with a frightened ex
pression en her face. \ "*Â¦
The day slowly advanced. The effect
of the fast was Impressed upon every
face." Only the little boys who had not
reached the fasting age looked happy,
munching legs and gizzards of chicken
and; making guesses and bets as to
what candles would burn out the soon

the fasting "age cf 13 sat exhausted in
the hay' that littered, the floor. ' Their

'drew up before the long house. No

and Malke was -not on the porch to

their hands and making the sign of the

woman pulled Mr. Takiff by his sleeve.
"May you live to see great-great

orphan who has a mother lying sick in
bed," pleaded a ragged boy. "Oh, pray,
give JTie something. Good life and
health to you! I have eleven children;

broken leg," entreated a woman with a
babe at her breast. In response to all
these pleas Mr. Takiff drew a bagful of
silver coins from upder his long coat
and distributed its. contents to the mis
erable alms-seekers. That done, we en
tered the synagogue.
The large "building was filled to its
very doors with pious worshipers, some
of whom read from books and cried
softly; others. shook their bodies vio
lently and shouted in most agonizing
despair; and still others wept,
moaned and beat their breasts as if
they meant to strike _them through and

shrouds, over which were thrown loose
ly white and black praying-shawls.
Hundreds of wax candles, stuck in a
large box of sand, burned before the al
tar, .and hundreds. of them flickered^in
the deep recesses 'of the'windows.'
Some belated people \ with penitent,
faces were pulling off.thejr boots and
unfolding their '.shrouds;' .many Â¦ re
mained at the door shaking hands and
asking forgiveness of one another, and
with tears in their eyes expressing re
gret for the past; here and there others
kissed her and blessed her Jn the' old
Hebrew fashion. She did not speak a
word, but I could see that her tears
ajmost stifled her.
"I shall" pray for you to-morrow*,"
her father said, as he stood upon the
threshold of the house, "and/ you should
also pray for us."
Malke wiped her eyes but did not
venture upon an answer. After we had
left the house Sarah went back to
kiss her once more.
As we' rolled away in the carriage I
glanced back at Malke. My heart al
most broke at sight of her, standing on
the porch, her hands clasped before,
her, her face streaming with tears.
Another instant and the thick forest
had shut her from my view. -But the
picture of her weeping In the doorway,"
with interlocked hands, v/as still vivid
before meâ as it is even ', now when
ever I think of '. er.
.On arriving at Gonsmar we left our
carriage at an Inn Â»and at once, re
paired to the "synagogue. The yard
about the house, of worship was
crowded with people. â Immediately be
fore the entrance of the synagogue
there stood a long table on which
plates were placed marked . "Hospital,"
"Orphan Asylum," "Hakhnoses-Kalo" '
(to bring poor maidens into wedlock),
and with the names of' the various
other charities of the communjty. Be
fore each plate sat some prominent
member of the congregation.
Mr. Takiff stopped before the long
table, bade them all "Gut yomtov,"
and droped five rubles ,In ( one.' plate,
ten" in another, three In another, until
and come to the dining-room," said
Mr. Takiff to me as I came In.
I found Malke. who had remained In
her room all day, lying on her bed with
lier head burled in the pillows. When I
delivered my message she answered me
dully: "I'll come in soon.'.'
In a few minutes she entered the
|n>oni and sat down* quietly, her face
white and drawn. Her mother glanced
at her pale face and quietly dropped
her eyes upon the prayer-book before
her. My heart ached with love and
sympathy for Malke. I wished to
speak to her, but I dared not and could
not.
We sat in an embarrassing silence
till the door opened and Mr. Takiff
ushered in a young man.
Oh. heavens! Shmunke Menke
Shnmnke's stood before me in all his
ugliness. His tall, lank figure, with
I" ' i head drooped over his chest, looked
c a failed sunflower bending the
ilk of its weight. His stooping
oulders seemed to have become more
untied, and the corkscrew curls that
ins over each ear had c/rtainly
lgthened. He wore a coat that al
.rst swept the floor, and an octagonal
apod hat with a long visor that
ershadowed his greenish eyes.

Mr. Takiff turned to his wife,

Ma.lke - p face changed from white to
arlet. then to white again. I had a
eat desire to knock down this in

e how he was to blame. Neither
alke nor I was introduced to
imunke. I managed to sit at one- end
the tablo. and as his eyes rarely left
_ _k plate 1 escaped recosnition.
During the meal Mr. .Takiff tested
the young man's shsrpness in the Tal
mud. The host questioned and the
bridegroom answered with wonderful
e.uickness. Mr. Takiff's admiration was
plainly read on his face: he was ecsta
tic over flr.dirg his future son-in-law
so well equipped for the battlefield of
hair-splitting discussions. The chosen
did not exchange a word with his
fiancee that night; once I noticed him

at the silent, trembling girl, but he
bashfully dropped his eyes as soon as
rho looked up. ..', 'Â¦'.'.Â¦
Depressed and miserable I sneaked
out of the room in order to avoid
ShTnunkc. I spent all of the next day
in the forest on the pretense of feeling
ill. I hated ,the whole wdrldâ Mr.
Takiff fnr bringing this Talmudic im'
beetle. Mrs. Takiff for not chasing
Phmunke out of the hous^ and I al
most hated even Malke because she
kept silent.
The following evening the betrothal

down in K shower, celebrating the sol

FATHER AGAINST CHILD.
The days parsed rapidly, bringing
Malke nearer and nearer to the day set
for her marriage. Her feelings for
Shmunke were obvious to me. but she
spoke very little to any one. and even
with me she went no further than to
gay that the was very, very unhappy.
A few days before the Jewish New
Year, while we were all loitering at
the table after we had finished dinner,
Mr. Takiff took notice of the silent de

But he threw off her hand and paced ,
up and down the floor, gazing wrath- ,
fully at Malke, who sat weeping with

"Confound you, pig's snout! Did you
see my daughter going away with the
Count?" ""
"No, Pan Notka, butâ"
The master lost control of himself
and shook the muzhik by hi3 ears.
"Where is my daughter? Tell roe quick
or â "
His excitement was so intense and
. his anger so fierce that he could not
finish the sentence. His wife dropped
upon a sofa and sobbed. Little Yankcle
(Jacob), frightened by the frenzy of
his father and the grief of his mother,
broke into wails. I stood in the middle
of the room,, etlff and cold.
"I saw Paj^e Malke walking toward
the forest about half an houc after the
Count had left," stammered the trem
bling Andrew.
"Harness the two best horses in the
light vehicle, Nikolai," shouted tho
master. "Israel and I will look in the
woods."
I realized the folly of searching in thÂ©
woods for Malke, for I divined the
cause of her disappearance. But I
made no objection, and accompanied
the agitated father to the forest. Tho
horses galloped as fast as they could;
Xikoini. at the command of his master,
whipped them mercilessly. On the way
Mr. Takiff did not utter a word, only
pressed his temples with his hand3 and
groaned>
When we reached the path that cut
through the forest, Mr. Takiff alighted
and asked me to walk with him
through the thick woods. We tramped
over stumps and fallen trees and
through the~*thlck underbrush. Every
thing, was quiet except the autumn
wind that whistled painfully' and tho
sound of our footsteps.
"Malke! Malke!" shouted the unhap
py father distractedly.
Nothing but a hollow echo came la
response. Once there was a noisa
which sounded like the cracking of dry
twigs under foot. We stopped and lis
tened with held breath. But it was
only the hissing of the wind.
At the other end of the woods Nikolai
was waiting for us with a carriage.
"To Count Losjlnski," ordered the mas
ter as we stepped into the vehicle.
In about an hour we reached the*
Count's palace. No light was to be
seen at any of the windows. Mr. TakifC
pulled the bell fiercely. % No one> cama
to the door. He rang again Impatiently
and again and again, but he only got J
the same silent answer that he received *
when he called for his daughter in the
heart of the forest.
We remained .standing on the steps
of the palace while minute after minute
passed, Mr. Takiff with his head hang
ing over his chest.
Presently we started hony*; there was
nothing else for us to do. . On our way
we accosted every peasant we met with
questions, but learned nothing. At
length we came to a small Inn kept by
a Jew, and here we stopped in the hope
of obtaining some clew. â¢
We found a shriveled, black-haired,
black-eyed little man seated at a table,
with his wife and three little children
by his side, eating their first meal
after the long fast. A few muzhiks sat
at another table in the same room,
smoking their stinking makhorka (a
poor quality of tobacco- and washing
their throats with delicious vodka.
"How do you do, Pan Notka?" said
one of the muzhiks, with long, flaxen
hair, a sharp little nose, and small,
shiny eyes peeping., from under a nar
row, projecting forehead. "You're
highly promoted. Pan Notka," he went
on Jestingly, before any one else could
speak. "I saw Malke driving with tho
Count In a carriage to-day," and he
winked at his companions.
Mr. Takiff fell back* and stood quiver
ing for a minute. Then he partially
controlled himself, and besought tho
peasant to teil him all he knew about
his- daughter. "Pray, Danila. whero
have you seen my daughter with the
Count? Have mercy on an old father,"
the old man implored, with tears rolling
down his soft, white face.
Sympathy for his grief could be read
in every countenance: even Danila ap
peared more earnest at these words.
"Well, Pan Notka, I'll tell you all X
know," said the peasant, putting his
'pipe aside. "You know, my^oat-fleld
lies right by the forest, and you know.
Pan Notka, this year we had a poor
harvest. At first there was no rain at
all. then there was too much rain. You
remember the hall that broke the win-,
dc-w-panes of your hothouse? So my
oatfield in the skirts of the Count's for

gather my oats until last week. This
morning, "an Notka, I went to gather
the last few sheaves I had there, when,
about two t o'clock In the afternoon, I
noticed the. Count Losjlnskl with your
daughter coming toward my field. And
the Count "was very good and kind to
day. He asked rn<- about my^harvwi
and about . the ' vegetables. Coming
home I told my wife there must be
something wrong with the Count, to
talk to me as if he were one of our set.
First the Count waited in the forest,
walking up and down and whistling.
then I saw your daughter coming.- She
was .wrapped In a large black shawl
and carried a reticule. I wondered at
first where she was going on the great
est of your holidays, but I said nothing,
because the Count fan to receive her

understand it. Then the Count whis

from the woods. They got In and
drove off as quick as the devil. In fact.
I couldn't believe my own eyes, and so
I told my wife, but. says I to myself:
.'Don't I know Malke, Pan Notka's
daughter?' My wife laughed right out
in my face,* and said the devil must,
have played a nice trick on me, and I
thought my Murianna was right, and it
must have been some ghost or devil, or
the evil spirits know what."
This story the peasant told In the
usual -' digressive peasant's style, and
finished by spitting on the floor unspar
ingly before returning to his pipel The
little innkeeper and his bewlgged wife
shook their heads and moaned: "Woe
is to us! woe is to us!" But Mr. Takiff
said nothing; he stood dumb, staring
idiotically. And we Immediately left
the inn.
About an hour later we arrived at
home. We found Mrs. Takiff lying In
bed, and an old peasant woman, who
was the physician of the village, at
tending her. Little Yankele was sleep
ing -In his clothes, crouched on two
chairs in the dining-room.
Mrs.. Takiff pointed to an open letter
that lay or the table. It ran thus:
"MY BELOVED FATHER AND
MOTHER â I go with the Count. I real
ize the pain and shame . I am causing
you. I know you will never forgive me
â it Is useless to justify myself to you.
The thought that I shall never see you
again makes me dizzy. How my blood Is
and suddenly rushed out of the room
and slammed the door after him.
CHAPTER XXV.
"YOM KIPPUR."
The family storra*- abated after this
fierce outburst. Mr! - Takiff, who was a
very devoted father, had simply lost
control of himself for the instant. He
was now all kindness. Of course, it
never for an Instant occurred to him to
yield to Malke's desire; but he began
to try to reconcile her to the coming
marriage by recitfng the great virtues
and ability of her choson, and by
drawing pictures of the -happiness and
the honor that the Illul would bring
her. Malke scarcely replied to his per
suasionsâa silence which her father
mistook for tacit acquiescence.
We had planned to spend the Day of
Atonement Jn Gonsmar, a town seven
versts distant, where the family al
ways went to worship, as there was
no synagogue in Dubrovka. On the
morning before the Day or Atonement,
Mr. Takiff. Mrs. Takiff and even little
Jacob rose early, beaming with happi
ness: for just as the following day Is
devoted to earnest prayer an* self
denial, this day is one of festivity and
rejoicing. It is incumbent upon every
God-fearing Israelite to feast and
thank the great Creator a hundred and
one times. And in order to fulfill this
commandment. Mr. Takiff took a bite
of various kinds of fruit and offered a
each time. ....-.â¢
Despite the general happiness, Malke
looked so sad and ill that her mother
suggested it would be wise for her to
stay at home if she would not feel
lonesome. Malke expressed her prefer
ence to remain, and it was so settled.
At dinner we dipped our bread in
honey â this being a symbolic prayer
that the coming year may be as sweet
as the bread we ate. After dinner we
prepared to start for CJonsmar. Mr.
Takiff. who made a grand appearance
in his long, black holiday coat,- called
together his servants and gave them
orders not to sell or execute any trans
action the next day. Suddenly Mrs.
Takiff began to weep, crying that she
feared to leave Malke benmd. But her
husband laughed at her forebodings,
and, said if X.'alke wished to remain at
home she might remain. Malke threw
her arms about her mother and kissed
her again and . again, and embraced
and kissed her father, her warm tears
trickling down his white Deard. H<Â»
The passage from the table to the
door was blocked by scores ef wretched
cripples, orphans and widows, . who
begged in most pitiful tones./As every
well-to-do man entered the synagogue

creatures, who perhaps had been wait
ing ail the year for this charitable sea

The experience of all was our experi

Day of Atonement all must be friends.
"Sins between man arid his Maker are
forgiven on Yom Kippur," laid down
the vTalmudic sages, "but sins of one
man against another are not atoned for
until the .wrongdoer asks . forgiveness
from the person wronged."
The t'philo .zako (the pure "prayer)
had already begun when we arrived. I
also opened a prayer-book . and mur
mured the pure prayer, but my mind
traveled back to Malke with her bowed
head and clasped hands.
A resounding clap on the big hollow
table at the altar suddenly silenced all
noises. Only the irrepressible sc/o of a

women from the gallery disturbed ths

lasted over .. an hour. Like warriors

From the women's gallery came a

the men to augment their own. The
hour was sacred, fearful, awe-inspiring.

CHAPTER XXVI.
A TRAGEDY WITHOUT BLOOD
SHED.
We found a carriage waiting, and
without stopping to break the fast in
town we started for home. The coach
man cracked his whip fiercely and set
the horses at full speed. Mrs. Takiff
was anxious about her daughter, and
asked the driver, who had been in the
innkeeper's house for fifteen years,
how he had left Malke. "All right," he
-muttered; and he snapped his whip
viciously at the horses' ears and cursed
them for their. slowness. I wondered
at this, for I knew Nikolai loved the
horses better than his wife. Even-w,hen
the horses were, galloping at breakneck
speed Nikolai 'did not stop his curses.

"RUSSIAN JERUSALEM."
One chilly autumn morning I arrived
in Kieffâ the "City of Churches." Its
numberless glittering spires, - gilt cu
polas, sparkling crosses, superb bel
fries, overtowering domes, and the
splendor and holiness or Its atmos
phere filled me with overwhelming ad
miration. The sight of the picturesque
Jerusalem of Russia, witn its number
less monasteries, cathedrals, and
churches, aroused in me new feelings,
new thoughts, new hopes, new aspira
tions. My innate lo"v*e for beauty in
any form stirred my enthusiasm to
wonderment, admiration, worship.
I found Ephraim easily enough, and
through him I found Dolgoff. The
former was pursuing his studies and no
less ardently his propaganda, and the
latter, by some means or other, man
aged, without doing a stroke of work,
to wear good clothes and eat the
choicest of food.
Dolgoff started on seeing me the first
time. "By thunder!" he cried, "with
that sprouting mustache on your, face'
and appealing look you're enough like
an old friend of mine to be his brother
(this mustache was a product of my
last year in Vilno). And by the by, one
of his namesâ he had a dbzen (this
with a rolling laugh)â was the same as
yours, Abramowitch."
I thought of Josephâ in my turn I
was startled. My heart beat wildly.
This (if this friend of DolgoITs should
prove my brother) was the first I had
heard of Joseph since I was a child;
and, In fact. I had scarcely ever
thought of him.
"What was the brother of mine like?"
I -asked controlling myself and at
tempting to laugh.
"Don't call him your brother, even, in
jest," returned Dolgoff. "You look a
CHAPTER IIL
A ROSE WITH A THORN.
During the winter and. the following
summer my studies were a passion
with me. My eagerness for study and
my inexhaustible craving for books
kept me so spellbound that the nights
for sleep appeared' to me like black
spokes in a fast-whirling wheel. I was
instinctively ah idler, and day dreams
were as natural to me as breathing. I
forced myself to read and study as
siduously all day and night. My
friends urged me to study less and give
more time to recreation. But how
could I? I realized there was so much
to learn, so much to observe, so much
to think about, and that I was so
Ignorant and life was so short. And
when I did permit myself a little res
pite in dusky twilight; wneji I figured
it was cheaper to rest than to burn oil
or candles, which I could ill afford, my
mind would immediately ''turn to lit
erature. I would revel in memories of
the works of/ Shakespeare and Milton
and Dante and Goethe and Schiller and
Lessing and Heine and Rousseau and
Moliere and Cervantes. I was in
spired by their grandeurâ and at the
same time I was humbled. To be
called a student without possessing a
thorough knowledge of literature,
philosophy, and all the sciences seemed
to me unpardonable pedantry. Such
thoughts, immediately followed by a
realization of my own insignificance
and ignorance, often drove me to de
spair; and I would quickly make a
light (not minding the cost, which fre
quently deprived me of a few meals at
the end of the month) and proceed with
my studies more arduously than ever.
To say that I devoured all the books I
could get hold of is scarcely a figure of
speech. Finding myself in a library
before many tiers of books, my brain
would become dizzy from a nervous
desire to read all the books at once.
In spite of Dolgoff's congeniality and
kindness, I soon determined that his
house was no place for me. I dreaded
people with secrets. So as soon as I
found employment by which I could
earn enough for bread and butter and
tea I moved to a small attic, from
which I looked down upon a wide ex
panse of roofs. Small as my room was,
I enjoyed it more than if it had been a
sumptuously furnished palace. I loved
the noiseless hum of silence at night,
and there in my forsaken nook, with
but a cot, a chair, and a table, I found
these comforts in all their lavishness.
Of Ephraim I saw little, and at Dol
goff's apartment I called rarely. The
former was too much engrossed in his
ideas and propaganda, and the latter
was busy fabricating passports and
printing circulars, which he took pains
to keep away from me. Besides, I had
made up my mind that the. secret bond
between the two was such as would not
admit.of investigation. From remarks
dropped now and then I learned that
they belonged to a revolutionary soci
ety, which I had no desire to join.
At the end of the summer I was ad
mitted to the sixth grade of gymna
sium, as Ephraim had predicted. My
answers to the examination Â¦ questions
drew attention to me. I overheard one
of the examiners remark to another:
"A bright Jewish lad." And the record
I made at examination I kept up in the
classrooms. I was constantly being
commended by my instructors.
But there is no sunshine without
shadow, no rose without a thorn. A
very sensitive person can k never be
happy; his feelings are so tender that
the least unkindness puts - him in
misery. -Happfhess is the lot of those
whose nerve? are dull, whose brains are
heavy, whose eyes look and do not see.
Unfortunately, I was very sensitive â
quick to see, quick to comprehend,
quick to feel.
And it was not long before I felt the
prick of the thorn. My assiduous study
and native aptness for. literature
brought me to the head of the class in
"The people that walk in darkness have
seen a great light." â Isaiah.
CHAPTER>"I.
"LITHUANIAN JERUSALEM."
The holidays passed mournfully
enough. Nothing was heard of Malke.
Her name was not to be mentioned in
her father's presence, though both of
the grief-stricken parents continued to
weep and groan, and the dreary fall
added a touch of gloom. I could not
bear to stay in this house any longer,
so when the first Enow fell I thanked
the broken-hearted people for their
kindness and departed. With a hun
dred rubles in my pocket I hoped to be
able to make a start In Vilno.
Late on Friday afternoon -I arrived in
the great city of enlightenment. The
streets of "Lithuanian Jerusalem," as
Vilno was Justly termed, were thronged
with running. Jostling, pushing men
and women, whose every look and ges
ture spoke of thrifty commerce. With
no particular destination in view, I
wandered through the busy thorough
fares, 6taring at everything about me
with astonishment; at the three and
four story white-plastered buildings
which seemed to me like bo many
towers of Babel, at the crowded side
walks, at the noisy pavements, at the
Emoothly rolling carriages, at the rat
tling carts, at the rushing droskies.
Everything was so different from what
I had been accustomed to in the small
dirty towns that I felt helpless, half
frightened.
I reached the marketplace. Here
more than ever I was aware that I was
in Vilno and on Friday â the busiest
day of all seven. I paused on a street
corner and looked about dazedly. Fish
mongers, fruit-venders, small dry
goods dealers called off their wares in
stentorian voices, asthmatic voices,
screechy, piping voices, jarring voices,
and in all sorts of intonations and dia
lects.
A heavy-cloaked, fat Jewess, with a
large woolen shawl twisted around her
head and covering all features but her
frozen nose and moving lips, solicited
trade In this wise: "Blessed women,
come, come; good, hot, mellow, and
rellshable beans; buy, women, for the
Sabbath. They will melt in your
mouths like granulated sugar â so may
the One whose name lam not worthy
of mentioning help me to see^my chil
dren under the bridal canopy â a real
bargain; a bargain as sure as I live."
"A bargain ' as sure as I live," piped
her little' daughter, while her mother,
was rubbing her hands and warming"
herself over the "fire-pot."
Another woman stood in the doorway
of a dry-goods shop, her hands under
her apron and her head cowled In a
heavy shawl, quarreling with a woman
who was leaving the store. "Outcast!
Vixen! May. your name be effaced from
the earth!" cursed the storekeeper.
"Don't I know that you go around from
store to store only to bargain and hag
gle without buying a penny's worth of
stuff? Ha! ha! ha! Did you ever see
such a pig, such an unclean animal,
who came over here from some small
town or village, and simply goes
around for the fun of bargaining? Ten
customersâ so may God help me and
give me good luckâ ten customersâ so
may I see my eldest daughter under
the bridal canopy and you in the
grave! â ten customers â so may ten
plagues set on your hoggish black face!
âten customers passed my door and
did not come in because you were bar
gaining with me, and they surely would
have bought more goods than you have
got in your store, you pig of a small
town! All the ten plagues of Egypt
shall rest on your hoggish head!" The
shopkeeper turned to the passersby:
"Nu! nu! Did you ever hear? She don't
want my goods, she says, after I had
turned the store upside down and
quoted her the cheapest pricesâ almost
at cost."
The would-be customer, a short,
heavy-set woman with purple cheeks,
blue lips, and a reddish snub-nose, had
been gathering wrath, and the now
turned it loose. "Thief! Pickpocket!
Your swindles are known all over the
world, 'from India unto Ethiopia.' Ha!
ha! ha! She thinks she has got hold of
a fool from a small town, and tries to
sell her a 'cat in a bag.' Before I ever
knew about your threadbare stolen
handkerchiefs and rotten silk I had'al
ready dealt in ten thousand rubles'
worth of satin and costly silks and vel
vets. All the storekeepers of our town
warned me not to buy any goods from
youâ so may I live to see my husband
and children in the best of health
' when I arrive home! All your curses
will fall in the deep sea where the
Egyptians were drowned, and where I
hope to see you swallowed. Must I buy

CHAPTER II.
MY SECOND BIRTH.
After a long res.tÂ»I awoke the next
morning with a happy word on my lips
â Vilno. I lay In bed listening to the
rumbling of wheels on the loud cobble
stones as if it were sweet music, and
later, glancing through my window at
the tier upon tier of high buildings and
domes and spires, I pictured myself as
Napoleon beholding the burnished roofs
and magnlficant structures of Moscow
before its doom. >.".;:
My joy was so overwhelming for
many days to come that all. past recol
lections escaped my memory; even the
fresh remembrance of Malke was mere
ly like the sour taste that remains after"
eating sweets. I thought of nothing
but the future. Nor was I troubled by
the suspicion that Dolgoff had *at first
aroused in my mind. I did my clerical
work as he bade me, asking no ques
tions. Not infrequently I wondered
what he did with so many passports,
which I copied, and what he did with
that printing-press, which I often
heard him work behind closed doors,
but I would instantly recall his stipu
lation and remain dumb. Did I have
any cause to disregard his orders? Did
he not treat me generously? Did he not
furnish me with books that I might
pursue my studies? Did he not help me
in every possible way? With such ques
tions I would quiet any misgivings. that
arose in my mind. And what a com
panion! His rich, elastic barytone,
which rang with tragic sweetness and
pathos on many a frosty winter night,
still chimes in my ears like a weird
echo whenever my mind recurs to that
period of my eventful life.
Two months passed happily in rou
tine work and study. One night about
Christmas time, while I sat reading, I
heard Dolgoff and another man talk
ing in the adjoining room. That there
was a man in his room was itself sur
prising, as Dolgoff had few visitors,
but my attention was attracted not so
much by the visitor as by something
suggestive in the voice of the guest
"S-h! I hear somebody stirring in the
next room," I heard the' visitor say.
'"This Is the fellow I told you about â
silent as a flsh."
A short pause.
"How soon must you have the pass
ports and the circulars?"
There was a sound like that of un
folding a large sheet of paper. VTo
morrow morning, if â¢ possible," the
stranger answered. "There is danger
if they don't get the passports in three
days."
"I am afraid to work at night. The
press makes too much noise, and my
housekeeper tells "me that the neigh
bors are getting suspicious of us." r
"How about getting the fellow to.
work to-morrow all day?"
Another' pause.
"I am afraid to trust him. He ap- 
peared dull at first, but I find him
quite shrewd." ' "
"Suppose you call him out so I can
size him up."
Dolgoff called, "Israel!" ,
â¢ I pretended not to hear.
He called a second time.
I stepped into the next room. It was
dim, and I could not see Dolgoff's com
panion very distinctly, but I noticed
that he wore a gymnasium uniform.
"Is that you?" the stranger ex
claimed.
I shrank back a step and said laugh
ingly: "The voice is Jacob's voice and
the hands are the hands of Esau."
"Don't you know me?" he asked,
again coming closer to me.
Ephraim! But what a change! A
heavy crop of dark, curly hair crowned
his well-formed head, a brown mus
tache shaded his upper lip, and his
keen eyes sparkled through a pair of
glasses. He was more erect, more
graceful than ever, and. In the smart
gymnasium uniform he looked quite
distinguished.
Then we forgot everything else and
talked of days gone by and of what
had happened to us since our separa
tion.
"I am in the seventh," he answered
to my question as to his class.
"And I am in minus one," I said Jo
cosely, though a trifle Jealously.
"You will catch up with the rest of
us," Ephraim assured me encourag
'ingly. "Once rid of the fanatics, the
rest is easy sailing. 'In der Beschrank
jmg zeigt alch erst der Melster,' " he
quoted Goethe. "The danger is now
over; one daring step brings the* ad
vance of two."
Although I rejoiced at meeting my
old friend, yet I dreaded his associa
tion. I realized that Ephraim's mo
tfves and ideas had always been wor
thy, but at the same time I feared he
was instinctively creating trouble for
himself and his companions. I did not
clearly upderstand in what complica
tion he was now involved, but the pass
ports of his and Dolgoff's fabrication.
,as well as the circulars printed behind
closed doors, were doubtless not serv
ing a legitimate purpose. However, my
situation was such as did not warrant
my severing connections with either
him or Dolgoff. And, besides, in spite
of Ephraim's revolutionary ideas,
which were not in harmony with my
nature, I loved him for his sincerity.
I . have always preferred erring sin
cerity to truth advocated by a hypo
crite.
The following day he took me to his
lodging, where we v discussed my future.
There would be no trouble in my being
admitted to the sixth, he assured me,
if I should Btudy all , winter and the
coming summer; but I had no passport,
without which, he said, I could not
even 1 present myself for 'examination.
After a few minutes' thought he asked:
little alikeâ only In physical appear
ance. He is one of the biggest rogues
the devil ever got into."
"He sounds interesting. Tou might
at least tell me a little about him." I
said, with a fast-beating heart, again
straining a light manner.
"He certainly was a lost soul," said
Dolgoff carelessly. "I heard it whis
pered that he killed his own father.
Whether this was true I can't say. But
I know he collected a lot of blackmail
from an important personage who was
mixed up in a murder, by threatening
exposure. I got to know him pretty
well, for we worked together for a
while â passports, you know. When I
first knew him he was living with a
woman, a gentile, who said she was his
wife. But they weren't married. He
had talked free-love hocus-pocus to
her till he had convinced her marriage
wasn't necessary. He soon deserted
her and ran off with a money-lender's
daughter and all of his money he could
get hold off. I haven't heard of him
since, but he's undoubtedly at the same
game. If I weiys you, Israel," he ended
humorously, with a soft, rolling laugh,
"I'd shave off my mustache and look
like some one else."
I did not dare question him any
further about Joseph, for fear my curi
osity, together with the resemblance he
had noted, might lead him to suspect
the relationship between his old friend
and me. Needless to say, I was . not
proud of Joseph., ;So I turned the con
versation upon Ephraim.
"Oh, Razovski Is now stirring Kieff
with 'liberty for the Jews' and 'assimi
lation,' " he said in answer to my ques
tion as to what was Ephraim's present
hobby. "He is always fortunate in
finding co-operators. A certain Judge
Bialnickâ a gentileâ is working inde
fatigably for the cause."
L "Judge Bialnick!" I uttered breath
lessly.
"Why, did you ever hear of him? He
comes from Lithuania and has spent
his life among Jews."
I did not answer his question; instead
I again changed the Subject. "And
what about Nihilism?"
"It is not dead yet." he responded in
a whisper. "That's how Razpvskl came
to meet Judge Bialnick. The Judge Is
at the head of our secret society here.
Matters will become lively pretty
soon." He suddenly checked himself,
as if he realized he had already talked
too much.
The information that Bialnick was in
Kieff took me completely by surprise.
I was so dazed that after leaving Dol
goff I almost lost my way. I recalled
that Bialnick had talked of being
transferred to Kieff, so this must be
the same Bialnick that I had known.
And Katia must be In Kieff, too. .A
thrilling hope took hold of me. I could
not see my way clear to a renewal of
friendship with her, but I trusted to
fate and my efforts.
I took up my new course of study
with fresh, zeal. Because Katia was so
near, because of the new hope that was
burning within me, the dry pages of
anatomy and materia medlca became
as attractive to me as volumes of
poetry. I was happy all the time be
cause I was breathing the ' same air
with Katia: and every evening I was
doubly happy, because then I walked
past her residence, which, I soon
learned, was in the Pecherski quarter,
the most fashionable part of the city.
But I suffered from material want.
Living expenses here were much higher
than at Vilno, and my earnings were
less. I eked out my livelihood by doing
some odd literary Jobs for a well
known periodical, but the remunera
tion, was so meager that I was often
compelled to live on one meal a day.
However, I was not discouraged. On
the contrary, my ambition was stimu
lated, and the time of the missing meal
was spent in writing verses. My muse
was very, active In those days. With
ink and paper before me, and a pen in
my hand, I felt as if I were riding on
a fast-sailing cloud, with the earth be
low like a mere child's ball.
Yet I could not substitute verses for
all my meals. So I advertised in a
local newspaper, and the second inser
tion procured me a position as tutor In
a wealthy family. The payment I
agreed upon was sufficient to carry me
through college. The first lessons I
gave were satisfactory, and now all
seemed easy sailing.' But I was soon
again reminded that a rose Is scarce
ly even without thorn. One afternoon,
as I presented myself at the appointed
time, I found the father Instead of his
two sons.
He bowed stiffly and in a courteous
tone said: "Wellâ aâ you will excuse
me â a â your name â a â deceived me."
And he smiled, as if he wished me to
understand the rest.
I looked dubiously at him.
"Don't you seeâ Mr. Russakoff?" he
added. "I don't believe you are the
kind of tutor my hoys need."
"Could you kindly specify my defi
ciencies, so that I may benefit by your
opinion?" I asked smilingly, though I
was filled with sudden despair.
"I beg your pardon, sir." He smiled
graciously. "The faultâ aâ is not with
you, butâ aâ withâ aâ the Jewâ"
My feelings at that instant were be
yond all description. I had suffered
many injuries of Â«a similar kind before,
but never had I felt so hurt as at this
time. . I went to my room and threw
myself upon my bed, and, man though
I now was, burst Into a flood of tears â
tears of rage, of humiliation, of help
lessness. Afterward I sat smarting at
my window, watching daylight turn to
dusk and twilight to darkness.
"He finds no fault with me, but with
the Jew." This ran througn my brain
for days. However, little by little my
wounds were healed. I soon began to
reason and ' look for excuses for my
abuser, as I had always done, and
found some justification ror his inhu
man, act. But I could not forsjet that
my college fees were due and my board
bill was not settled.
And now a daring plan came into my
mindâ a plan suggested by my recent
company had made me f eel as if we
had been lifelong friends. - But what
did it matter as long as I was in Vilno
â in Lithuanian Jerusalem â in the
great city of light and culture* Finally
magic hope sung a sweet lullaby and
lulled me to sleep. , .
that course. The jealousy of the gen
tile boys was provoked, and I suffered.
During recess, when the boys would
play and fight, I could not pass through
the schoolyard without insult. One
would gather the skirt of his coat in
his hand in the shape of a pig's ear
and imitate that unclean animal as I
passed; another would mimic my walk;
some one else would bespatter me with
ink blown through a straw. Nor -were
these the worst pranks they played up
on me. Need I say that I suffered? The
word suffer is not adequate to express
what I felt. It was not their Jibes and
mockery alone that hurt me. I* was
hurt as much by their injustice to my
race. It was not me individually that
they insulted, but the creat suffering
people of Israel. - 'Â¦ .
Many a night, when' myj tormentors
were peacefully asleep, . !â¢ lay In my
dark 'little chamber and longed for the
Ghetto and the Talmud, .Several times
I determined to give up all hopes of be
coming a distinguished- man and go
back to the Beth-Hamedresh and the
musty folios of the Talmud. "Is not
the confined Ghetto, with all its dirt
and bigotry, the safest corner for- the
sensitive Jew?" I would ask myself.
"There at least, though I suffered
physically, I w,as not a target . for
sneering and Jeering and . unbearable
offenses. There at least my heart and
stntlments were not wounded. The
swineherds who had beaten me were
ignorant and were therefore not quite
responsible for their inhuman act. But
now, among educated people who are
taught to reason and who boast of civ :
ilization, why should I feel like a
strayed lamb among a pack of wolves?
What fault do they find with me that
justifies their Insults? What makes me
an object of scorn? I do not ask of
them to love me. Toleration Is all I
pray for." -
But the next morning all my yearn
ing for knowledge would come back to
me, and I would go on with my. studies
with unabated) zeal.. Though It has
never been in .my nature to humble
myself before* any one, I learned after
a while! in spite of my pride, to walk
humbly before those brutal boys. I
even used" to correct some of the stu
dents' compositions before they had
been handed to the teacher. And what
recompense did I get for It? Smiling in
sults and tacit offenses.
After all, I derived a certain benefit
from all these Injuries. The misery I
suffered through the prejudice of my
tormentors strengthened "my will; the
sneers I received because I was. of. the
fugitive race lent courage my timor
ous nature. .Suffering Is the best culti
vator . of character. The " wrongs
others had done to me made me realize
the wrong I was doing to others. Per
secution taught me tolerance, sympa
thy, truthfulness. Justice.. y
After a time I began to take thought
as to what profession I should enter. I
finally settled upon mecicme, though I
had no inclination for it. In Russia a
Jew may not do what he wishes, but
what he is permitted to do. I chose
-medicine because it was the most Inde
pendent'profession open to me.
During all the period of study and
torture the image of Katia was con
stantly arising in my mind. Her sov
ereignty over me, which had lapsed
during Malke's brief sway, was now
more absolute, more absorbing; it
sweetness to my existence. I could not
clearly see where or how I could ever
meet her again, but I was young, and
youth ' is ever hopeful. When" my
teacher pronounced my verses "de
cidedly promising" I regarded this suc
cess as a partial fulfillment of Katia's
mprediction. that I would become a
famous poet. Then would come the
consuming ambition to realize her ex
pectations, and I would study and
write more zealously than ever that I
might become as great as Nekrassoff or
Lermontoff or Pushkin.
So several years passed â years of tor
ment, of study # of versifying, of dream
ing of Katia. On my graduation day I
heard, as I once had dreamed: "A gold
medal for Ivan Petrowitch Russakoff."
Ephraim had graduated the year be
fore and had gone to Kieff, to study in
the university; and thither I also de
cided to go.
"Would you mind changing your
name?"
I did not divine his meaning at first
and looked at him somewhat dubiously.
"Why, don't you understand?" He
lowered his voice. "I can get .you a
passport under a different name, pro
vided you would assume that name.
Kvery three years you may renew the
passport and live undisturbed all your
life." ;
I felt that it would not be easy to
part with my name; it seemed to me
like changing my nose without remod
eling my other features. But after he
had laid the proposition before me and
explained the impossibility of my ac
complishing anything without 'such a
step, I submlted to this change.
So that /very afternoon, in the pres
ence of Dolgoff,: Ephraim presented me
with a document that bore the Russian
eagle .arid smilingly said: "I'll be your
godfather and christen you Ivan Pe
ti^svitch Russakoff, a native of Pskoff.
Remember, you are a native of Pskoff."
he repeated warningly. "And now you
are safe." ,
That night. I lay awake for hours.
Hitherto I had worked with enthus
iasm, I had been in much the situation
of one who is trying to find his way
alone through a wilderness. Ephraim
had pointed the direct path to me; his
advice helped, me to reduce my de
sultory plan to order. My hopes grew
stronger as I tossed about on my bed.
I began to look into 'the future. I saw
myself in gymnasium' uniform; I saw
myself studying arduously to win
prizes; I saw myself in the midst of a
graduating class and heard distinctly,
"Gold medal for Ivan Petrowitch Rus
sakoff" â and then, ghostlike, a picture
began to take hazy shape. Gradually
the figure, assumed more definite out
lines. My heart began to throb faster
and the blood in my veins ran more
swiftly as the picture became clear be
fore my eyes. I held my breath. A
blooming maiden, with rich brown hair
hanging down her back, stood by my
side, smiling. I thought I, heard her
murmur very softly: '"You' foolish Is
rael! Why, then I'll marry you." ,
your rotten goods? Get yourself a big
ger fool than me. No, no, little sister"
â this in a tone of mockeryâ "you can't
sell me your stinking goods., I was not
born yesterday."
"Fish â trembling, live fish. Just from
the bait, as good as the leviathan,"
struck in a fishmonger, winking signifi
cantly at the two quarreling women.
"The Czar himself may eat them. Try
them, buy them, good women. Eight
copecks a pound â eight copecks. Fresh
and trembling, good women."
Bewildered by the tumult and con
fusion I strolled from stall to stall;
staring about me in countryman fash
ion. I paid dear for my curiosity.
Every time I raised my eyes to the
high buildings some urchin was certain
to aim a painful blow under my chin.
Once the blow was so powerful that
when I recovered from my surprise I
found my image deeply imprinted in a
heap of snow.
At length the yellowish street lights
began to flicker. I had never before
seen such illuminations, and they filled
my mind with admiration for the mag
nificence of the Lithuanian metropolis.
"While engrossed in sight-seeing I was
utterly unconscious of the biting frost
and the dust-like sprinkling of snow in
the air; but now that my curiosity was
half-satisfied and night had fallen I
began to feel the cold and think of a
place to spend the night. I had money
in my pocket and might easily have
found lodgings,. but I was so at a loss
in this big city that I actually feared to
try. At one tavern after' another I
stopped, but could not summon courage
enough to open the door. 1 1 might have
walked the streets all night had I not
soon observed that on every corner po
licemen were eying me, made suspi
cious by my having: so often passed
and repassed them. As" my fear of
them was greater than my fear of Inn
keepers, I determined to seek refuge in
the first lodging-house I should come
across.
I pushed open the door of an ale
house and, half-embarrassed, remained
standing like a beggar on the very
threshold. Two men seated at a little
table were talking in low tones, and at
first seemed not to observe my pres
ence. A minute later, however, one of
the men looked up at me angrily # and
said to his companion: "The beggars
are eating the flesh off our bones. They
give us no rest even on Friday night."
Then he asked sarcastically of me:
"How many suppers have you had to
night?"
I was humiliated. I fingered the
money in my pocket, with a strong de
sire to pull out the roll of bills and
show him that I had more than enough
to pay for a meal.
"He's not that kind of a bird," ,the
other remarked, rising from his seat.
"What do you wish?" demanded the
first man, who was the proprietor.
In a faltering voice I told him that I
was a stranger seeking lodging for, the
night, for which I was ready to pay in
advance. My explanation seemed to
appease the angry proprietor, and com
ing near me he asked: "What is your
business, young man?"
I could not understand what right he
had to put this question to me, but as
I lacked courage to refuse an answer I
told him I had come to attend the gym
nasium.
"Talmudlc sucklings are flocking in
dally, so that the yeshlvas will soon
have to be closed for want of students,"
he said to his companion. Then turn
ing to me he said in a tone of dis
missal: "This is no lodging-house,
young man."
I was about to leave, when his com
panion, who had been scrutinizing me
silently, inquired: "Have you any
friends here?"
"I don't know a soul in the city," I
answered.
He contfnued to look sharply at me,
and after a moment's hesitation asked:
"Da you write a neat handâ I mean
Russian?"
"I think I do."
"If you are willing to do some copy-
Ing â for an hour or two a day â I will
give you lodging by way of compensa
tion and give you an opportunity to
earn a few rubles besides."
This was Indeed a godsend. I ac
cepted the offer straightway.
A few minutes later we were walking
through the streets, while my com
panion was questioning me about my
past. Me was tall and solidly built,
with Jet-black curly hair, and with,
what I thought, mischievous-looking
eyes. At first I was apprehensive of
danger; but there were candor and
sympathy In his wards, and his offer
was too inviting for one in my circum
stances to reject, so I soon dismissed
all suspicion from my mind.
"We presently entered a large, gloomy
courtyard. After we had climbed two
narrow stairways my friend rapped on
a door. We were admitted by a young
woman into a dimly lighted apartment.
He introduced the woman as "the lady
who keeps house for me," and he
showed me Into a peat-looking room
which contained, besides a bed and a
little table, a small printing-press.
"Israelâ don't mind my calling you
by your first name; I also wish you to
call me Adolph, not Mr. Dolgoff," he
laughed merrily, and slapped me on
the shoulder by way of encouraging
good, fellowship â "Israel, make your
self at home here. I hope you will not
find me a bad fellow. But I must add
one stipulationâ whatever you see or
hear keep to yourself; ask no questions.
When you have had as much experi
ence as I you will find this advioe very
helpful to you. Children must be
taught to talk, grown people to keep
silent."
After I ha'd supped on very palatable
food I went to bed. But although I
was worn out hours passed before I fell
asleep./ The incident of my meeting
Dolgoff and the scenes I had witnessed
during the day kept me awake. My
new friend looked mysterious; every
thing about him was suggestive of a
secret; and yet his cordial manners
won my confidence. One hour in his
boiling! But I could not help myself. I
love Count Losjinskl: the thought of him
nils me with life and love. Can I resist
when a greater* force, which governs you
and me and every one else, has taken pos
session of me? Do you remember, father,
you used to tell me that whatever one
does It is the will of God? If this Is true,
then, it is not my wrong, but His, who
made me love the Count. If you cannot
forgive, forget not your ever-loving
, "MALKE."
The aggrieved father scanned the let
ter with a wild stare in his eyes. He
remained speechless . for a moment.
Then, as if awakening from a delirium,
he rose to his feet, got a knife, and
with a nodding head and tears flowing
over his face came up to his wife.
"Sarah, our daughter Malke Is no
more!" he said in a hoarse, tremulous
voice. "Her chastity is gone! Our child
is dead to usâ dead! Krea (rend your
clothes)."
And as he said this he made a cut in
his wife's Jacket, then in the lapel of
his own coat, and eat down 'on the
floor heavily.
"Malke is deadâ dead!" he groaned
through his streaming tears as he
swayed his body mournfully. Â¦
"Oh. my child! Oh, Malke! Malke!"
wept Mrs. Taklff bitterly, wringing
her hands. â¢
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
4â¢ The next day was the ever-memora
ble March 13. 1*81â the date of the as
sassination of Alexander II. The bomb
which exploded In St Petersburg shook
the entire empire. Immediately the
whole nation was in mournng; the
theaters were closed, music was for
bidden, every place of amusement was
desolated. The very air was filled with
sadness and fear; every heart trembled
with consternation, for even a loud
laugh was regarded suspiciously. The
student element fearefl tne most, for
the students were known a3 the chief
conspirators. Following the murder,
they were arrested everywhere on the
slightest shadow of suspicion; thou
sands were Imprisoned during that
month. Close watch was kept over all
the students, and the least suspicion or
denunciation was sufficient to throw a
student into prison, pernaps never to
come out again. People in the streets
did not talk above a whisper. One
heard of nothing but arrests.
That night I sat in my room trying to
study, but could not fix my mind upon
my books. The news of the murder of
the Czar and a fear that In some man
ner the Jews would be made scapegoats
had' unnerved me. I moved restlessly
about my room, stirring my fire, peer;
ing out of my window at the snow
sheeted roofs, listening to the passage
of crunching footsteps and tinkling
sleigh bells.
About midnight there was a gentle
knock on my door. 1 jumped up with
A GREAT EVENT.
CHAPTER VII.
After a while we began to talk of the
years that had passed since I had
tramped through the sleety night away
from Zamok. She told' me of her ex
periences, all of which were very quiet,
for her life had moved on evenly and
happily: and I told her of the Yeshiva
of Javolln, of . Malke, of the gymna
sium at Vllno. Then our talk became
more broken.
"How surprised father will be to
learn who you really are," she said at
one time during the evening. I made
haste to suggest that it might be wis
est not to reveal my identity to him
Just yet, giving reasons which, though
plausible, were not the ones which
actually influenced me. To this she
agreed.
When I told her the poems which
appeared weekly In the Moskovski
Gazette, and for which she had often
expressed admiration, were mine, she
assumed an "I-toId-you-so" air that
was bewitching.
"Don't you remember, I used to say
that some day you would be a great
poet like Pushkin or Lermontoff "
"And then." I interrupted her, "you
remember what you promised?"
"Why, you foolish Israelâ then." she
laughed rapturously and dropped her
head on my breast
I asked about the officer whom I had
seen so frequently at her house and to
whom I had that day been Introduced,
and she confessed to me that he had
proposed to her twice within the last
two weeks. : ;".'
"When you think of that fine-look
ing man how can you love me?" I
asked with a tinge of Jealousy. "Meâ
a Jew?" ]
"Oh. you foolish, foolish boy!" she
cried, again showing her affection in
a way that was mere expressive than
words.
Contiauad Kext Sunday.
I BEND TO THE CROSS.
CHAPTER IX.
"It seems strange," she went on hes
itatingly, playing with the golden cru
cifix that dangled over' her bosom.
"When my feelings are touched I. have
very few words to say, and for the
rest" â she broke the sentence with a
forced laughâ "I cry. I think \ that
tears are the poetry that flows from
the very depths of one's soul, while
words come more from thej>ra!n. Don't
you ever feel inclined to shed tears,
Mr. Russakc-ff?"
"Sometimes." I replied in a stifled
tone; and immediately I added with an
attempt at lightness: "And sometimes
I relieve my feelings as the poets do â
In verses."
A silence of a minute or more fol
lowed, during which she glanced at me
several times from under her lowered
eyelashes.
"Do you know." she resumed, clearing
her. throat as she spoke, "the more I
see of you the more you remind me of
Israel. He was always melancholy."
The following morning I was called
before the chief, and after a brief trial
was told to go home, but warned that
I was "under the suspicion of the po
lice."
On ray way home I learned from Mr.
Levinski. who had had an interview
with the chief of police concerning
Ephralm, that Ephralm was also ar
rested on suspicion only, but his case
was rather serious because he had car
ried on some correspondence with Pro
fessor Dragmanoff, who was a great
agitator "of nihilism and who had fled
to Switzerland. The worst for Eph
raim was, however, his being found de
stroying papers, and the discovery in
his trunk of letters from Dragmanoff
after his denial of ever having corre
sponded with the professor. Besides
other "censored" books, "The Revisor"
(Gogol's famous drama of corruption),
which had been particularly suppressed
that winter, was also found in Eph
raim's possession. Mr. Levinski gave
it as his opinion that Ephralm would
certainly be sent to Siberia.
However, the misfortune that befell
my friend, and the still graver afflic
tion that the nation had sustained by
losing the noblest of its emperors, were
as naught compared to my anxiety
about Katia. Of what interest or
value was Russia to me? What did it
matter' that the liberal Czar was as
sassinated when Katia, who was more
to me than my nation, my creed, my
race, and above kings and queens, was
away from me and yet dwelt in the
innermost chamber of my heart* For
who is more selfish, jealous, conceited
than a lover? Human beings, the ani
mal kingdom, and other matters like
pen, ink, or paper, serve only one pur
pose â to communicate his or her fever
ish sentiments to the beloved. Even
the world plays a trifling part when
the egotistic lover is engaged In the
amorous vanity of the heart And yet
the world was built on love, so the
poets say. Love is the magnetism
which holds together the molecules of
humanity.
I stayed In my room two days, and
then, the excitement being over, I
went to give Katla her regular lesson.
I was shown into the reception-room,
where I found her taking leave of a
tall stout man of military bearing. I
had met him several times before, but
he had evaded an introduction, always
overlooking me with obvious contempt
This time he could not avoid meet-
Ing me, but he acknowledged the Intro
duction formally with a bow that
seemed to mean: "What the devil is
the Jew doing here?"
He remained only a few minutes
longer, and when he departed he did
not .give me even so much as a friend
ly look.
"Is it not horrible, Mr. Russakoff?"
Katia began tremulously. "My father
has been sick In bed for the four days
since the fearful news reached us. He
takes this catastrophe so to heart It
is terrible. Oh, the Nihilists are ruin
ing this country! Why cannot people
live peacefully, I wonder?"
She dropped Into a chair as If from
sheer exhaustion. She evidently knew
â¢nothing of misery, of suffering, of
starvation, of oppression â she did not
even know her own father.
For a while we talked of her father,
of th* Nihilists, of the possible results
of the Czar's* assassination; and then
our talk shifted to Heine, whose
."Relsebllder" she was reading with my
assistance.
"I always wondered how those poets
could write so much on the single sub
ject, of love," Katia remarked; and
then she immediately blushed, as if
she wished to recall her words.
"Because they felt so much," I an
swered.

occupation as tutor and my desire to
pee Katia. I wrote a brief formal note
to Katia, without giving my real *uune,
stating that I was a student in the uni
versity who desired to do same tutor
ing, mentioning the branches which I
felt competent to teach, and explain
ing that I was writing her because I
understood that she desired instruction
in one of these subjects.
Two days later the answer came.
She desired a tutor In Garman, she
wrote â In fact, she had just applied for
one at the university; so she would be
glad indeed to talk with me and per
haps arrange to give her the desired
lessons.
CHAPTER. V.
I SEE WITHOUT BEING SEEN.
The following day I ascended the
steps of the Bialnick mansion with a
quivering heart A footman immedi
ately answered ray ring, ushered ma
Into a sumptuously furnished room,
and disappeared with my card.
A few minutes later a side door
opened. Katla! At sight of her I
trembled so that I could hardly keep
my feet Katia! Katsa *t last! The
same Katia. but so grown, so changed.
In* my dreams of her all these years I
had always seen her as a slight girl in
a short frock, with her hair hanging
down her back. Now she stood before
me a young woman. The slight figure
had matured: her gown swept the
fioor; the luxurious hair was coiled at
the back of her head. But her lumi
nous eyes, of no particular color, but
rather a mixture of many colors, wÂ»re
the same, and her soft smile was the
same, for she was smiling at some
thing when she came In, and I could
see she was as graceful, as sweet as
ever.
I steadied myself with my hands up
on the back of a chair, and wondered if
she would recognize me. But I had
changed in the years of our separation
more than she had. She greeted me as
1 an absolute stranger.
"Is this Mr. Russakoff?" she asked In
her low, sweet voice.
I acknowledged my name with a bow.
I could not trust myself to speak- But
I Immediately gained control of mysolf
and we proceeded to* business.
After we had arranged the hours of
instruction, price and books, I re
marked: "I ought to inform you, per
haps, at the outset, that I am a Jew.
Perhaps you have objections to my
race ?"
"Mr. Russakoff. your question sur
prises me," she answered. "Why, my
father is known as a friend of the Jews.
As to myself"â here she laughed softly
and a blush crept down her neck â "my
dearest playmate when I was a little
girl was a Jewish boy."
At this the control I was trying so
hard to maintain almost left me. I
gripped myself and said with a show of
calmness: "I did not know how you
felt; some people are so narrow-minded
and so prejudiced"; and I told her of
my recent experience.
"That is a shame!" she cried lndig-'>
nantly. And then, as if to express her
feeling, she added: "It Is, of course,
natural for me to like tne Jews on ac
count of my early Intimacy."
For a moment I was tempted to dis
close my identity, but I obeyed the ad
vice of prudence to remain unknown.
' I soon left her and repaired imme
diately to my scantily furnished room.
She recalled our early romance as a
mere childish fancy, while with me It
had matured into a deep-rooted affec
tion. I now realized more than ever
how deeply I loved her.
But what a gulf there was now be
tween us! We were no longer boy and
girl, I told myself, with the natural
impulses of childhood. She was now a
charming woman of high social posi
tion, and Iâ a vagabond, a poor devil
of a Etudent, with nothing to Inspire
or charm her. True, ehe had called ma
brother when I was a mere tramp, a
wandering little gipsy, but that was
many years ago; true, she still remem
bered me, but to her I was only a
pleasant znemeory. That was all I was
to her â a pleasant memory â a bit of
recollection of playful childhood.
This change of thought brought the
Images of her father ana my father to
my mind. I shuddered â the blood of
Judge Bialnlck was flowing in her
veins. The consciousness of my race,
of my faith (little as It was), of the
duty I owed to my innocent father,
stirred my blood and woRe xay calm
nature. I ought to think only of
vengeance. I ought to abandon my
wild plan and see Katla no more!
But when the decision was half made
my heart was torn with anguish and an
irresistible desire to see herâ Just to see
her and hear the cadence of her voice
again â that and no more; just to ba
near her asd feel her presence â nothing
further; Just to be her teacher without
ever breathing to her the secret of my
heartâ that was all I wished.
CTTAPTERVL
CUPID'S ARROWS.
When I called to give my pupil her
first lesson I found her father present
A shiver passed through ma as ha
grasped my hand. Ha eyed me so In
tently that I thought ha had recognized
me, but his remark that followed con
vinced me that be had net
"It Is rather strange. Mr. Russakoff."
he said, "that there Is a close resem
blance among Intellectual Jews. At
the first glance I thought I had met
you before."
I made an evasive remark, and he
chatted on, asking about my native
town, my parents, my previous studies;
to most of which questions, I am sorry
to record. I gave false replies in order
to avoid suspicion. *
As he sat talking In his big armchair
I watched him furtively. The change
in him was almost startling; his hair
and beard were fast turning white, and
there was a perceptible nervousness in
his movements; even the hue of his
skin had changed. His eyelids drooped
frequently, and there was a certain
"You must not be afraid of me," I
said, thrown into throbbing confusion
by her words. "I am too weak to hurt
anybody."
The night following that afternoon I
lay a long time awake, my mind a prey
to incoherent thoughts and memories.
"How your eyes change from their
steady brown to pitch black" passed
through my mind again and again. I
had never noticed the color of my eyes.
She had. What could it mean? "You
remind me of Israel, the Jewish boy I
told you of." I again recalled hef
words. Evidently the memory of that
boy was still sweet to her, and evident
ly she was interested in me. My heart
almost leaped out of my breast at the
thought
I was near falling asleep from mere
mental exhaustion; my mind was rav
ing already â Just a wink from uncon
sciousness â when in the blank darkness
of my chamber the form of a female
shaped Itself before me. Thick, light
brown hair with a silky gloss, brilliant
ly smiling eyes, an exquisitely shaped
mouth with deep corners, fine arched
eyebrows, a fine bosomâ It "remained
but a moment, then gradually faded
away, and in its place the small golden
crucifix which Katia wore suspended
from a fine gold chain around her neck
grew larger and larger until it assumed
the shape and size of a female form. A
minute later the figure of a woman
again appeared, and again it vanished;
and that little golden cross was meta
morphosed Into the form of a person,
and â behold! the features were mine.
Oh, that little golden cross! What
pangs and mortification It added to my
wounded heart! As soon as I would
begin to think of Katia (and when did
I not think of her?) that tiny cross, as
if by magic, would appear before my
fancy, swaying to and fro and growing
larger and larger until It assumed the
size and proportions of a human form
with my own features.
Weeks passed by. The hope that had
sprung ud within me was soon suc
ceeded by doubt by thoughts of my
awn Insignificance. Of course I loved
her madlyâ loved her es no one else
had ever loved. I thought. But I had
also been In love many times with the
brilliant stars that shone on a serene
frosty night And was I not as far
from my beloved Katia as I was from
the stars? "I, a poor vagabond, a strug
gling student who earned his bread by
glvlnglessons and scribbling lyrics at
a penny a line, a wandering Jew bated
and scorned by all. without a place to
call homeâ have I the right to love
Katia and drag her down to my levelâ
her who, besides her social position, is
in every respect superior *to me?" I
would ask myself.
"But have I no right to love her,
"Read it again. Gospodln Russakoff,"
she asked, sighing deeply, when I had
finished the last line. "You speak like
a poet yourself, and how your eyes
change from their steady brown to
pitch black! You remind me of Israel,
the Jewish boy I told you of," she
added, smiling faintly. "I almost fear
you when you read as you have done â
your eyes look so strange when you are
aroused."
While I read, Katia sat with her lus
trous eyes fixed upon me. She did not
once stir. She seemed as much pos
sessed by this magnificent lyric as I
was.
laxity, like that of extreme Indolence,
in his speech and gestures. Every few
minutes he nervously passed his hand
over his eyes, an act which I soon per
ceived had become with him a habit.
I found myself speechless in his pres
ence. I was surprised at myself. I
had always told myself that when
chance brought us together I would de
nounce him and take vengeance; but
now that I was in his presence I felt
no angerâ Instead, I pitied him. I
could easily see that he constantly
suffered great pain, that he was a phy
sical wreck; and it was obvious that he
suffered mental agony no less intense
than the physical. For the time, com
passion banished my hatred.
' I continued giving Katia lessons four
times a week without so much as be
traying a sign of my Identity. Occa
sionally we would drift off the lesson
to the discussion of other matters. We
talked of history, of novels, of poetry,
of characters in fiction. I often won
dered where I got the phrases and pic
turesque descriptions which I used in
making my ideas clear to her. I simply
drew inspiration from har to give it
back to her. Sometimes her look would
thrill me; then I would drop my eyes,
and when again I raised them I would
see her cheeks suffused with blushes
and her own eyes burning with intense
emotion. I would wonder if that show
of feeling was induced t>y our talk-ror
was it an indication that she cared for
me? I realized that I was a nobody,
and therefore she could not care for
me; and yet how kindly, how sympa
thetically she treated meâ me, a vaga
bond, a son of the hated race, a child of
persecution!
I was playing with fire. I knew It.
and yet I loved to be burned. I' would
feel happy and miserable at the same
time. I would become possessed at
once with Jealousy and hatred of my
self for harboring that Jealousy. I rea
soned that if she now loved meâ Ivan
Petrowitch Russakoffâ she had forgot
ten Israel Yudelowitch Abramowitch,
and I could not bear the idea that she
did not love my old self.
One afternoon I gave her my inter
pretation of Heine's "Traumbilder, II."
I read with s all the glow and enthus
iasm with which this bard, whose soul
I understood better than that of any
other poet, has always Inspired me. I
forgot my sorrows In feeling his. His
words seemed to me like drops of
honey dripping from a poisoned honey
comb. His heart was poisoned with
the same venom that embittered my
own. I have always imagined when
reading Heine that when he laughed
tears were trickling down his cheeks,
and when he cried a smile of defiance
and irony played around the deep cor
ners of his mouth.
"I'll go," I reiterated, moving about
Impatiently. Many conflicting thoughts
rushed through my brain; it was the
battle between revenge and forgive
ness. "Love your enemies, bless them
that^ curse you, do good to them that
hate you, and pray for them that de
spitefully use you and^ persecute you,"
a weird voice whispered to me, "I'll
go â I'll go," I reiterated nervously, lest
I should change ray mind.
Dolgoff took a bundle from under his
arm, unrolled it and disclosed an ar
tificial beard, a pair of glasses and a
cap with a cockade. he
asked. In an Instant I was entirely
transformed; my daily companions
could not have recognized me. "Re
member, you are Doctor Orshanski, the
famous surgeon. The impersonation is
complete." He examined me studious
ly and added, half to me, half to him
self: "The hat should be drawn a lit
tle lowerâ that's better."
In another instant the beard and hat
were thrown off and I .beheld Dolgoff.
"Razovski is in the net," he said in
a low, tremblous voice. "As usual, I
escaped," he added with a faint smile.
"'I came to you for help."
I answered nothing. ,
"Not for me: I am safe," he contin
ued. "Razovskl's friend, Judge Bial
nick, is In danger. His house is guard
ed. The police spy him. If he leaves
It lit three-quarters of an hour (which
he will unless he is warned In time) he
will never see his home again."
"I'll go," I said, trembling with agi
tation.'
"Don't say yes before you hear the
nature of your mission," he said smil
ingly. "Blalnick's house Is guarded
three squares around. You will be
stopped half a dozen times within the
Pecherskoi. and unless successful you
will not come back to this cozy nook.
I don't want you to undertake this
task without fully realizing the risk
attached to It"
"I'll go/' I repeated - parrot-like,
shivering with anxiety for Katla.
"I would have gone myself but my
absence from, another place would
ruin a score of faithful members. A
secret meeting, which was discovered
by the police, was to be held to-night.
Every member who will start'for our
meeting-place will never see his home
again. I don't wish to impose upon
you, but If you are fearless enough
you will have a chance to save the life
of a noble man, who is also a champion
of the Jews." : . : s '
I told him that I was an orphan and
that I did not know of my relatives,
nor in fact did I know whether I had
any.
"Search the room," commanded the
chief to his subordinates. Every nook
was ransacked. They even threw my
pillows out of their cases. But noth
ing suspicious was found.
"What are these short lines?" de
manded the chief pointing at a manu
script poem, without It
"It is a poem," I said.
"A what?" . Hi '
"A poem," I repeated.
"Well, you'll have to explain to the
chief of the detective bureau what a
poem is," he replied with a burst of
laughter. And ordering me to appear
before the chief, he and the other offi
cers departed.
The relief I felt at their departure
can be easily imagined. While they
had been /ransacking my room I saw
the prison gates yawning to receive
me. I went to bed, not to sleep, but.
to wonder fearfully what changes the
next few days might bring.
Presently there came a third knock-
Ing at my doorâ this time so gently
; that I cpuld scarcely hear, it I held
my breath. Everything was still; only
the buzzing of the burning lamp was
heard." I feared to answer the knock,
so I rose on my elbow and stared in
terror in the direction of the -door.
"Israel!" came through the keyhole
In a husky vÂ«lce. '?-*;â¢
. VWho is it?" I asked.
"Open."
I opened the door, and started back
a step or two. A large, bearded muz
hik, in a sheepskin hat and fur cloak,
girdled by a red belt, stood in the
doorway. Warning me by a gesture to
keep silent, he bolted the door behind
him.
I explained to him.
"Do you have any relations in St
Petersburg by the name of Russa
koff?"
a palpitating heart (though I knew the
knock was too gentle for the police)
and turned the kne-b. A short, stocky
man wearing glasses stood before m<s.
He was Mr/ Levinski, a gifted journal
ist with whom I had become ac
quainted through Ephrarm.
Mr. Levinski entered, pale and shiv
ering. "No time to stop." he % whlspered
hurriedly. "I have just come to warn
you. Razovski has been arrested. Ex
amine . your, booksâ quick. The police
are ransacking the whole city. Eight
Jewish students* have been . arrested.
Good night." And he dosed the d^oor
behind him." '-P^iPk
1 bolted the door and examined every
scrap of paper I had in my trunk. I
burned all the letters I had ever re
ceived from Razovski and some manu
scripts that might be. construed In a
manner to throw suspicion upon me.
I thought I had nothing to be afraii
of, and a little later I tested the lock of
my door and crept into bed. I had
scarcely settled myself for sleep when
three blows against the door made the
walls of the house shake.
"In the name of the law, open!"
thundered a voice.
I leaped out of bed and unlocked the
door. Four officers entered. ,
"Is your name Ivan Petrowltch Rus
sakoff?" demanded the leader.
I said that was my name.
"Do you know a student by the nama
of Razovskl?" I was asked abruptly.
"Yes."
"Did you have any communication
with him?"
I said that we had exchanged some
friendly letters.
"When did you first get acquainted
with" him?"
In one of our talks I casually touched
the history of the Jews in Spain, the
pages of which are aflame with fire
and blood. I must have talked with no
little fervor and enthusiasm, for I no
ticed tears sparkling in tne eyes of my
pupil. I asked whether I had' hurt her
feelings. She only smiled in response,
but a minute later she said in her
sweet, sympathetic voice: "It must
have hurt you to speak of it, Mr. Rus
sakoff. How your eyes changed!"
After that lesson I went home like a
somnambulist. I recall a collision with
something or somebody, and that some
body muttered: "It is really a shame to
have drunkards stagger through the
streets." Next I remember my head
met with something as bulky and as
hard as mine, and the owner of it
grumbled, "Bolshay durak (big fool)!"
and then I remember, as through a
mist, myself seated on the old sofa in
my room, my head between my hands,
looking fixedly upon the Head of a nail
in my caroetless floor. I cannot tell,
how long I studied that object before a
Jolly laugh, which sounded queer In my
ears," interrupted my reflection, and a
hand shook me by the shoulder rather
violently.
I looked up and recognized Ephralm
Razovskl.'
"You - must have a nightmare,"
laughed Razovskl again, slapping me
on the shoulder. "I rapped on your
door more than etiquette permits, but
you we're evidently so absorbed In your
dreams that you did not hear me at all.
So I ventured to open the door myself,
â¢for I saw the key sticking on the in
side. Wake up, comrade! You must
not dream in your fur coat." Again he
laughed a hearty, sonorous peal.
"You are perhaps dreaming of writ
ing for the Morning Star an article
against assimilation, you Orientalist,
you Ghetto mystic," he continued,
having received no answer from me.
"You always come out with your bosh
about the glorious Jewish past, their
wonderful history and their philosophic
monotheism, and so forth, and so on.
Can't we look Into the face of truth
and realize that the world is waiting
for us to assimilate if we just say the
word? Wake up, you dreamer!" And
he slapped me on the shoulder again.
"There must be .something wrong
with you," Razovskl continued, shak
ing me by my lonp.-hair. 1 "Wake up,
Israel Che always called me by my
Jewish name). If it Is love, a night's
rest and sound sleep will readily cure
you of It I fell in love at least a score
of times, and every time I thought I
would not be able to survive It, and in
spite of that I lived long enough to fall
in love with spme other 'best girl in the
world.'." '
He shook my head in both his
hands and examined my face playfully.
"I surmised correctly," he laughed.
"Your absent-mindedness and these
blue rings betray you. Indeed, you are
more sensitive than I thought; this Is
only a momentary sickness. Once I be
lieved that a person could love one girl
only, and If that one rejected him he
should seize the first knife he could get
and send his soul to the Detter world.
My 'twenty-six years or experience,
however, have taught me differently.
If you are in love with a girl and she
Is indifferent to you, seize the first op
portunity and fall In love with another.
This is the best cure I can recommend
as a layman. Ha!ha! ha! Isn't that a
good prescription for a lawyer?"
"Well, good night, comrade," he said
after a few moments of silence. "I Just
dropped in to see you. It is getting daik
and I have yet a lot of work to do.
Well, good night I will let you dream
of your best girl," and he slammed the
door after him.
though she Is so much above me?" I
jvvould demand in behalf of my passion.
"Must the poor's right to love be re
stricted, Just as are all his other priv
ileges, and confined within a narrow
compass?" And anger would swell my
breast against all the rich people of the
world, as if they had taken sides
against me. "She may not reciprocate
my loveâ that Is as she will. I only
Justify my right to love her."
But if she was to learn that I loved
her, I told myself, she would discharge
me immediately. Dismissal I could not
stand. I would rather a thousand
times over suffer the pangs of an un
told love than be sent awny from her.
Her servantâ her slaveâ I cared not
what my position was so : long as I
could continue to see. her. -
"Now go." he said. Â¦ "You will find
a droshky on the corner. Get in with

The droshky sped lixe lightning for
fully twenty minutes. The \ driver
avoided principal streets. I was only
stopped once, and before I had time to
give my name the officer said, "Pass
on, Dr. Orshanski," without any inter
rogations. Other particulars of the ride
I do not remember. All the way my
brain was so feverish that I was like
one stunned. , When I was just In the
act of, ringing the bell the door opened
and the Judge appeared before me.
robed in a heavy fur clcak. ,1 deliv
ered my message and for fear, of being
recognized by him I turned quickly and
sped home.
Again there was silence. I quivered
with delight at the introduction of my
old self. "What became of this early
friend?" I asked at length.
She flushed slightly and twirled the
chain of her crucifix.
"He ran away. He was too sensitive.
In that respect he was also- like you."
"I suppose he felt guilty of some
wrong. Sensitive people cannot bear
their ov.n wrongs, though they can
tolerate the same wrongs in others,"
I rejoined.
"No. It was I who was to blame for
it all." She flushed again. "I commit
ted the wrong and he was punished.
My father wars a little too harsh on
him."
Then she added: "I am Inclined to
believe' that my father was also very
fond of that boy, for he talked of him
quite often, and of his purpose to edu
cate him and make a great man of hinv
He was exceptionally bright."
"And yet you drove him out of yoor
house and forced him to become a
vagrant, as he undoubtedly has be
come." I said, forgetting for the mo>
ment that I was supposed tor know
nothing of this incident
She glanced at me in bewilderment
at these words. "You are quite mis
taken,' Mr. Russakoff," she rejoined
somewhat confusedly. "He ran away
voluntarily."
I perceived that she was not awara
that I had been asked to leave, and I
saw no reason for enlightening her.
After an awkward pause ~ I said Jeal
ously: "It* is unfortunate for two
young people -of different stations In
life to fall in love. It is better that
they should be separated. Think of
that Jewish boy" â I was smiling and
yet trembling â "now grown to man
hood and come to claim you."
"It would all depend," she replied,
looking down and fingering her cruci
fix.
"Yes, it would all depend on his be
ing rich and famous and handsome,"
J said bitterly.
"Oh, no. It would all depend on his
being the same as he had been." she
said very softly, her face warm with
blushes. "There is nothing specific we
love; we love something indefinable,
and we can only love as long as that
indefinable attraction exists."
"But suppose," I continued eagerly,
my eyes fixed intently upon her, "your
early lover should come as a poor
student, nameless, without a fortune,
and yet possessed of that indefinable
something?"
She quivered perceptibly and turned
her eyes away from me, her breath
coming fast and short.
All my feelings of unworthlness, all
my vows of silence went to the winds.
I . leaned forward, on "fire with love,
and caught her hand. "Katla !" I
whispered.
"Katla!" I Implored. "Don't yoo
know me?"
She trembled, "and her head sank
forward so that I coulet not see her
face.
"Katiaâ Katla, I have lived for
years with one thought, one desire,
one hope â to find you. And at last I
have found you â Katia!"
Â¦ Her breast rose and fell violently,
but she did not speak.
"I am the same Israelâ the Israel
who used to play with you â who used
to love you." I pressed her hand more
closely. "Don't you rememberâ don't
you remember that afternoon when we
Bat together? Don't you remember
your promise? Aren't you the same
Katla who once loved me a little â a lit
tle bit. at least?**
A hot tear splashed upon my wrist.
"Katla!" I cried, all my soul in that
.one word.
I dropped to the floor beside her and
dared to touch her chin, with the inten
tion of raising her head. But It came
slowly up of its own accord. She
turned' her glorious eyes, brimming
with tears, full upon me, and her face
threw open heaven to me.
"You â you! Oh, Israel!" she whis
pered.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
5lad that -you can tie to your bench

to find him when you come back?
When is your next meeting and
where?"
"The meetings are held in this room,
and the next will be on Wednesday
night at 11 o'cUJck." _ ,
"Bless my soul!" cried. Ballengeich.
"Would nothing content you' but to
drink the whole bucketful?: The "ren

escapes, your head's on a pike." .
"Aye," murmured the shoemaker, dis
mally.
;-,"It Isn't taking very many of you to
overturn the iiouso- of â¢ Stuart," said
the laird, looking about the room,
which was small. .
/'There's just one less than a dozen,"
replied the cobbler. *
"Then- we'll inaks up the number to
the even twelve. I will meet you here
on "Wednesday night at this time, and
learn whether or no they agree to have
niH as one Â«?f "their number. If. they
refuse, there's no harm done; I shall
say nothing. 1 and "the King will know
no more about the matter than he does
now.":.-'
Â¦ "I could not ask you better assurance
than that," -said the host' cordially, as
hlÂ« guest rose.
They shook hands, and the guidman

where until he listens to wisdom."
"And It is In your mind that my
house should become a prison for the
King?" -,.....
"It seems tome worth considering."
".There seems to me very little worth
considering in the matter. It is a
mad scheme. Supposing .the King
promised under compulsion, what
would be his first action the moment
he returned to Stirling Castle? He
would scour the country- for you,, and
your heads would come off one by one
like buttons from an old coat." /
' "That's what I said, 'Trust the word
of a Stuart,* says* I, 'It's pure non
sense.' " . __._ â¢"
"Oh. I'm not sure but .the word of a
Stuart is as good as the word of any
other man," replied Ballengeich. with
a rlngof anger in his voice, at which
the cobbler, looked up surprised. Â¦>
; "You're not such an ' enemy of the
King as you let on at first." commented
the mender of shoes. "I t "doubt If- I
should have told you all this."
"Haveno fear.', I can pledge you that
my word Is as good as a Stuart's at
least." >;_
,"I;hope:it's a good deal better."
, "Your plan; is not/'only useless, but
dangerous,"* my. friend.-. I told "you I
would give you '. my advice, and now
you have" It Do you think James Is a
. cobbler dryly, "when you came plump
on my shoulders."-, -",-.'
. . "By the way, did you ever hear any
more of the thief, you were after?"
"That's just the point I am coming
to. The man. we were after was 'his
youthful Majesty James V of Scot
land."
"What. Â¦ the King!" . exclaimed the
amazed laird;:;; "I
"Just him and no other," replied the
cobbler, "and very glad I am that the
plot miscarried, although I fear it's to
come on again." ""'.
"I never heard the like of this""
Â¦ "You may well say that ; <You see. It
is known 'that. the King in disguise
visits a certain house, for Â¦â¢ what -pur
pose his Majesty - will .be 'able to; tell
you better than I. He goes unattended
and secretly and this gives us our
chance." .^ '
"But what in. the name of the 'god of
fools, whoever he happens to be. would
you do with Jamie once you got: him?"
" 'Deed, there's many, things" that
might be mended, in this 'country.- as
you very well know, and the King can
mend them, if he likes, with . a . word.
Now,; rather tha^ have his* throat cut,
our. leader thinks he will agree to rea
sonable reform." \ '-
, "And supposing be 'doesn't agree, are
you going to cut his throat?!*' ;
"I don't know what would happen if
he proved stubborn. The moderate
is as good as his bond, arid the
strongest oath ever sworn never yet
kept a rascal from divulging a secret
intrueted to him." \
"You're right in that;. you're right
i!i that," the cobbler hastened to add;
"but this involves others as well as
myself and all are bound to each
other by oaths."
"Then I venture to say you are en
gaged- in some â¢ nefarious Â¦ business.
What is it? I'll tell nobody, and
mayhap, young as I am, - 1, can give
you some plain, useful advice from
the creeri fields."
"Well. I'm not at all sure that we
don't need it. for to tell the truth I
have met with a /wild set. of lads and
I find myself wondering. how long my
head will be. in partnership with my
body."*
*'Is the case as serious as that?"
"Aye, it Us." _
"Then why not withdraw?"
"Ah, that's easier said than done.
When, you once shut a spring door
on yourself it isn't by saying *I. will*
that you get out. You'll not have for
gotten the first night we . met, when
you jumped down on my back from
the wall of the Gray Friars* church?"
â¢ "I remember It very distinctly,, but
which was the more surprised, you or
I, I have never yet been able to
settle."
"Not so much as I," interrupted the
of Ballengetcn. after peering out into
the darkness to see that the way was
clear, took his leave.
The laird was prompt in keeping his
appointment on the following Wednes
day, and learned that the conspirators
were glad of his assistance. The cob
bler's tool box had been pushed out of
the way, and a table, com
posed of three boards and two trestles,
occupied the center of the room.
"We have been told," began the
leader, who filled the chair at the
head of the tab'.e, where he had ad
ministered the oath with much solem
nity to their new member, "we have
been told that you own a house, which
you will place at our disposal should
the purpose for which we are gathered
here together succeed."
"I have such a house," said the laird,
"and it is, of course, placed freely at
your service. But the plan you pro
pose is so full of i danger that I wond
ered If you have given the project the
deep consideration It deserves. It will
be a hazardous undertaking to get the
King safely into my house, but let us
suppose that done. How are you go-
ing to keep him there?"
"We will set a guard over him."
"Very good. Which of you are to be
the guardsmen, and how many?"
The conspirators looked at one an
other, but none replied. At last the
leader said:
"It will be time to settle that when
we have, him safely under bolt."
"Pardon me. not so. The time to ar
range all things Is now. Everything
must be cut and dried, or failure Is
certain. The moment the King Is
missed the country will be scoured for
him. 'There will be no possible place
'of refuge for miles round that will not
be searched for the missing monarch."
"The King is but a boy. and when he
sees death or compliance before him
he will accede to our demands."
"Suppcse, then, he gives consent to
all you place before him? Do you
think he will keep his word?"
"I doubt it," said the cobbler, speak
ing lor the first time. "The word of a
Stuart Is not worth the snap of my
finger."
"On the other hand. If he does not
accede." continued Bellengelch, "what
are we to do- with him?"
"Cut his throat," replied the leader
decisively.
"No. no," crlpd several others, and
for a moment there was a clamor of
discussion, all speaking at once, while
the laird stood silently regarding the
vociferous disputants. Finally their
leader said:
"What better plan have you to pro
pose ?**,â¢ ' i
"The King is a boy," spoke up Ballen
geich, "as you have said." At the sound
of his voice instant silence reigned.
"But he Is a boy, as I have told you,
extremely difficult to handle with vio
lence. I propose then that a deputation
walt'upon his Majesty and place before
him the evils that require remedying,
being prepared to answer any question
he may ask regarding the method of
their amendment. If peaceable means
fall, "then try violence, say I: but it Is
hardly fair to the young man to ap
proach him at the beginning of his
reign with a dirk In the hand. I have
some friends about the castle." con
tinued the laird. "I supply them with
various necessaries from the farm: and,
if T do say It myself, I am well thought
of by some in authority. I can guar
antee you. I am sure, a safe conduct
for your mission."
"Will you Lead the delegation and be
Its spokesman?'*
"No. My power to serve you lies in
the fact that I am well thought of in
the palace. This power would be In
stantly destroyed were I known as dis
affected. I would put It on this basis:
My friend Flemmlng is the spokesman
of ten others who have grievances to
place before his Majesty.- Therefore. 1 as
a matter of friendship between Flem
mlng and. myself, I ask' safe conduct
for the eleven."
"Indeed." cried the cobbler, "I wish
you would "leave my name out of the
affair, since no one else seems eager to
put his own : forward."
"I .put mine fqrward In making the
request," said Ballengeich.
"There Is wisdom In what the laird
says," cried one of the more moderate

Y ATK evening had fallen on the
I m gray walls of Stiriing Castle, and
I I dark night' on the town itself.
With ( sume suggestion of stealth
In his movements, a young man picked
his u-ar through the thickening gloom
ut the streets. There was still light
cnouph to show that, judging by his
ccstume. he was of the well-to-do
tanner dats. T1Â»Â«? youth descended and
descended until he came to the lower
j&rt of the town, where, turning aside
up a narrow lane, he knocked at the
door of a closed and shuttered build
ing, evidently an abiding :>!ace of the
lNÂ»orer inhabitants of Stirling. With
sÂ«;me decree of caution the door was
slightly opened; but v.'hen the occupant
tiaw l,y the flash of light that came
from ivlthin who his visitor was, he
threw the ;.<>rtal wide and narmly wel
coiiK-d the newcomer. . â¢ ,->Â¦
"Key. guidman!'.' he cried, "ye're late
the night in Stirling."
"Yes," said the young man/stepping
inside, "tfut the furm wiil set; nothing
of ne till the morning. I've a friend in
town who gives me a bed for "myself
and a stall for my horse, and gets the
tame in return when lie pays a visit to
the country.*"
'"A fair exchange." replied the host,
as he closed and barred the door.
The lov'room in which the stranger
found himself was palpably a* cobbler's
"Well." said the shoemaker, with a
laugh, "what's wring with you?"' â¢'"..
"Wrong with me? Nothing. Why
do you thiiiknlun- Is* anything amiss?"
"You are flushed in the face; your
breath comes quick, as if you had been
running, and there's a set about your
lips that s;te;is anger."* "
"You are a very observing man,
Tic mining." replied he of the plaid. "I
had a fight up the street. One of those
young court s:>rig.s riding to the castle
tried to trample me under the feet of
his horse and struck at me with his
whip for getting into his road, so I had
just to plaster my back against some
body's front door and keep out of the
vay."
"'It's easv to see that you live in the
country, Ballengeich," replied the cob
bler, "or you would never get red in
the face over a little thing like that."
"1 had some thought of pulling him
off his horse, nevertheless," said the
L*lrd of Ballengeich, whose brow
wrinkled into a frown at the thought
of the indignity he had suffered.
"It was just as well you left him
filonc," commented the cobbler, "for an
unarmed man must take ' whatever
those court gallants think fit to offer,
and, if wise, he keeps the gap In his
face shut, for fear he gets a bigger
gap opened in his head. Still, I am
speaking rather freely, and doubtless
you are a firm friend of the now
King?" ard the shoemakcV cast a
cautious eie>long glance at his visitor.
"A friend of the King? I wonder to
hear you! I doubt If he has a greater
enemy than myself in all Scotland."
"Do you mean that. Ba-llengelch?"
inquired the shoemaker, with more in
terest than the subject appeared to
demand, laying down his hammer as he
spoke, and looking Intently at his
guest.
"I'd never say It if it wasn't true"
replied the laird.
4** You are n Â°t a married man, I think
you told me?"
"No. I am not. There's time enough
for that yet." returned the other with
a smile. "You see. I am new to my'
situation of responsibility, and it's as
well not to take in the wife till you
are sure vou can support her.**
"What like a house have you got,
and how far Is it from Stirling?"
'The house is well enough in its
way; there's more room in it than. I
care to occupy. It's strongly built of
.stone, and could stand a siege if neces
sary, as very likely it had done in
days long past, for It's a stout old
mansion. It's near enough to Stirling
for me to come in and see my friend
the cubblcr In the evening, and sleep
in my own bed that night, if I care to
do so."
"Is it in a lonely place?"
"I can hardly say that It is at the
top of a bit hill, yet there's room
enough to si\-e you rest and retire
ment from the busy world of the
town. What's n you mind, Flem
mlng? Are you swithering whether
you'll turn farmer.or no? Let me In
form you that It's a poor occupation."
"I'll tell you what's on my mind,
BaJlengelch, if you'll swear .piously
to keejj it a secret."
"Indeed, I'll do nothing of the
eort." replied the young man de
cisively. "An honest man's bare word
party.""' "I never liked the kidnaping
idea."
"Nor I," said the cobbler. "It was
but a. wild Hlelan*. notion." .
"My project has this advantage,"
continued Uallengeich with nonchalant
impartiality, "that 1* It does not suc
ceed you can then fall back upon ab
duction. Nothing in this proposal in- Â¦
, terferts with the ultimate carrying out
of your first plan."
At last It was decided that all should
go. if Ball^ngelch couid procure a writ
ten safe-conduct signed by the Kins.
which would Include eleven persons.
Within three da;'s this document was
placed in the hards of the cobbler by
Ballengelch. who to!d him that it haU
been sisned that morning. And We
added that the King had expressed
himself as wtH'.jdeased to receive a
deputation of his loyal subjects.
The cobbler handled the passport
gingerly as if he were not altogether
assured of its potency to protect him.
"The conference is for Wednesday at
midnight," said Ballengeich. "Assem
ble some minutes before that hour In
the courtyard of the castle, and you
will be conducted to the presence."
"Wednesday:" echoed the j cobbler,
his face turning pale. "Why, Wednes
day, the day of <>ur weekly meetings?
Did you suggest it?"
"It was thei King's suggestion, of
course," replied Ballengeich. "It is
merely a coincidence, and Is. I think, a
good omen."
"I wish I were sure of it," moaned
the cobbler.
Before the bell rang twelve the con
spirators were gathered together in the
courtyard of Castle Stirlingâ huddled
would perhaps be the more accurate
word, for they were eleven very fright
ened Men.
As the bell slowly tolled twelve an of
ficial camp from the nalace into the
courtyard, searched the delegation for
concealed weapons and curtly com
manded them to follow him. Climbing
the stone stairway they were ushered
into a lar^e room containing a. long
oaken table with five chairs on one side
and six on the other. At the head of
the table was a high-backed Â«eat re
sembling a throne. The official lefn
them standing there alone, and after he
nad closed the. door they heard the
ominous sound of bolts being thrust
Into their places. The silence which
followed seemed oppressive, almost suf
focating. At -last the tension was
broken, but it would scarcely be con-eci
to" say that it was relieved. The heavy
curtains parted and the King entered
the room, clad in the imposing robes of
his high state. A frown was on his
brow and he advanced straight from
the doorway to the throne at the head
of the table without sneaking or cast
ing a glance at any one of the eleven.
When he had seated himself he said
gruffly: v Â» Â¦'; L> V
"There is a chair for each of you, sit
down."
It is doubtful if any of the company
except the cobbler at first recognized
their ruler as the alleged Laird of Bal
lengeich: but at the sound of the mon
arch's voice several started and looked
anxiously one at another. Again the
Kins addressed them:
"A week ago to-night I met you in
Flemming's room. I appointed this day
for the conference that the routine of
your meetings might not be disturbed.
as I thought it well that the last of
your religious gatherings should be
held in the Castle of Stirling, for I
nm resolved th:it this conclave shall
be your final effort in treason. One of
your number has stated that the word
of a Stuart is not to be trusted. This
refutation "appears to have descended
to me, and. it Is a P^>' 1 should not
take advantage of it."
When the King ceased speaking he
lifted a small mallet and smote a re
sounding bell which was on the table
before him. A curtain parted and two
men entered bearing between them a.
block covered with bluck cloth; this
they placed silently in the center of
the floor and withdrew. Again the
King smote the bell and there entered
a masked executioner with Â¦ gleaming
ax over h!s shoulder. He took his
place beside the block, resting the
head of .his ax on the tloor.
"This." said the 1 King, "is the en
tertainment I "have provided for you.
Each of you shall taste of that." and
he pointed to the heading block.
The cobbler rose unsteadily to his
feet, drawing from his bosom with
trembling fingers the parchment bear
ing the Kings signature. He moisten
ed his dry lips with his tongue, then
spoke in a low voice:
"Sir," he said, "we are* here under
safe conduct from the King."
"Sate conduct to where?" cried
â¢ James angrily; "that is the point. I
stand by the document. Read itâ
read it!" , - V Â¦
"Sir, It says safe conduct for eleven
men here present, under protection of
your royal word."
'â¢ "You do fNt keep to the point, cob-
Mer," shouted the King, bringing his
first down on the table- "Safe con
duct to where, I asked. The parch
ment does not^say safe conduct back
Into Stirling again. Safe conduct to
heaven or elsewhere was what I guar
anteed."
"That is but an advocate's quibble,
your Majesty. Safe conduct is. a.
phase well understood by high and
low alike. Nevertheless, I would re
spectfully submit to your Majesty that
I alone of those present doubted a
Stuart's word and am like to have my
doubts practically confirmed. I would
also point to your Majesty that my
comrades would not have been here
had I not trusted the Master of Bajlen
geich. and through him the King;
therefore I ask you to let me alone
pay the penalty of my error and al
low my friends to go scathless from
the grim walls of Stirling."
"There is reason in what you say,'
replied the King. "Are you all agreed
to that?" he asked of the others.
"No. by" God!" cried the leader,
springing to his feet as lustily as the
King had done. "We stand together
or fall together. The mistake was
ours as much as his and we entered
these gates with our eyes open."
"Headsman," said the King, "do
your duty." .
The headsman whipped off the black
cloth and displayed underneath it a box
containing a large jug surrounded by
eleven drinking horns. Those present,
all now on their feet, glanced with
amazement from the masked man to
the King. The sternness had vanished
from his Majesty's face, as if a dark
cloud had passed from the sun and al
lowed it to shine again. There spark
led in the King's eye all the Jubilant
mischief of the Incorrigible boy and his
laughter rang to the celling. Some
what recovering his gravity, he
stretched out his hand and pointed a.
finger at the cobbler.
"I frightened you. Flemmins!" he
cried. "I frightened you; don't deny it.
I'll wager you my gold crown against
a weaver's woolen' bonnet I frightened
the whole eleven of you."
"Indeed." said the cobbler with an
uneasy laugh, "I shall be the first to
admit 1L"
"Your face was as white as a harvest
moon In mid-day, aiicl I heard some
body's teeth chatter. Now. the drink
we have had at our meetings hereto
fore was vile, and no more fitted for h
Christian throat than Is the headsman'"
ax; but. If you ever tasted anything
bettor than this, tell me where to set a
hoeshead of It."
The headsman having filled their
horns, the leiÂ»drr raised the tlason
above his head art! Paul:
' "I give the toast of the Kins!"
"No. no." proclairnfd the boyish mon
arch. "I. want to drink this mvself.
I'll give you a toast. May th*re npver
come a time when a Scotchman I*
afraid to riÂ«k his head for what hv
thinks is risht."
And this toast they drank together.

had so much trouble with. X wouldn't
write to that man. He's a rascal. Dad."
"What did he ever do to you and your
mother?:*
"I'll tell you. Dad; though it's a mat
ter I don't talk about much. My father
had trouble back there fifteen or six
teen years ago. _ He was running an
engine, and had a wreck; there were
some passengers killed. The dispatcher
managed to throw the blame on father,
and. they indicted him for manslaugh
ter. He pretty near went crazy, and all
of a sudden he disappeared, and we
never, heard of . him from that day to
this. But this man- Scaylor. mother
stuck to it. knew something about
where father was; only be always de
nied It."
Less than a week afterward a gsntla
little old woman stepped off the flyer
at Zanesville and Into the arms of
Georgie Sinclair. A smart rig was la
waiting, to which her son hurried her
and they were driven rapidly to thÂ«
hospital. When, they entered the old
fireman's room together the nurse
softly closed the door behind them.
But when they sent for Neighbor
and me. I suppose we were the two
biggest fools in the hospital, trying to
look unconscious of all we saw in the
faces of the group at Dad'a bed.
He never got his old strength back,
yet Neighbor fixed him out, for all
that. The skyscraper, once our pride.
was so badly stove that we gave up
hope of restoring her for a passenger
run. So Neighbor built her over into
a- sort of dub engine for short runs.
stubs and so on. and though Dad had
vowed Ions ago, -when unjustly con
demned, that he would never touch
a throttle, we got him to take the sky
scraper and the Acton run.
And when Georgie, who takes the
flyer every other day. is off dutyMxe
climbs lnlo Dad's cab. shoves the old
gentleman aside and shoots around the
yard in the rejuvenated skyscraper
at a hair-raising rate of speed.
After awhile the old engine got so
full of alkali that George gave her
a new name â Soda- Water Sal â and It
hangs to her yet. We thought the
best of her had gone in the Harvard
wreck, but there came a time when
Dad and Soda- Water Sal showed us
we were very much mistaken.
"And that indictment was wiped out
long ago against father." said Georgia
to me, "but that rascal Scaylor kept
writing him for money to fight it witb>
and to pay my schooling â and this
was the kind of schooling I was yet
ting all the time. Wouldn't that kill
you ?"
I couldn't sleep till I had hunted up
Neighbor and told him about It and
next morning he wired back transpor
tation for Mrs. Sinclair to come ont
on.
His face contracted and Georgrie rose,
frightened. With a herculean effort tha
old man raised himself up and grasped
Georgie's hands.
"Son." he gasped to the astonished
boy, "don't you know me?"
"Of course I know you. Dad. What* s
the matter with you? Lie down."
"Boy, I'm your own father. My
name is David Hamilton Sinclair. I
had the trouble â <Jeorgie." He chok
ed up like a child and Georgie Mc-
Neal went white and scared; then hs
grasped the gray-haired man In bis
arms. ' .
When I dropped in an hour later
they were talking hysterically. Dad
T7as explaining how he had been send
ing money to Scaylor every month,
and Georgie was contending that
neither he nor his mother had ever
seen a cent of it. But one great fact
overshadowed ail the villainy that
night; father and son were united and
happy and a message had already
gone back to the old home from Geor
gie to his mother, telling her the good
news.
I've been on the relief, so ; I'm -/trying
to make up a little now for my old
mammie." , ,
"Where does yours so. Dad?" I asked.
"Me?" answered* the old man, eva
sively. "I've got a boy back East;'get
ting to be a big one," too. He's in
school. When are you going to- give us
a passenger run with the skyscraper.
Neighbor?" asked Hamilton, turning to
the master mechanic.
"Soon as we get this wheat up on the
high line out of the way,'' replied
Neighbor. "We haven't half engines,
enough, to move it, and I 'get a wire
about every six hours to move it faster.
Every siding's blocked, clear to Bel
grade. How many of those sixty-thou
sand-pound cars can you take over
Beverly â¢ Hill with your skyscraper?"
He was asking both men. The en
gineer looked at his chum.
"I reckon maybe thirty-five or forty,"
said MeNeal. "Eh. Dad?" .,. â¢
"Maybe, son," growled " Hamilton;
"and break my back doing it?" :
"I gave you a helper once and you
kicked him off . the tender.", retorted
Neighbor.
"Don't tv ant anybody raking ashes
for me â not while I'm drawing full
time." Dad frowned.
But the "upshot of it was that we put
the skyscraper at -hauling wheat, and
within a week she was doing the work
of a double-header. ."
It was May, and a thousand miles
east of us. In Chicago, there was
trouble in the wheat-pit on the Board :
of Trade. You would hardly suspect
what queer things that wheat scramble
gave rise to, affecting Gecrgie McNeal
and o!d man Hamilton and â¢> .lot "f
other fellows away on the railroad di
vision of the Western plains; but this
was the way of it:
â¢A man sitting in a little office on
La Salle street wrote a few words on
a very ordinary looking sheet of paper
and touched a button. That brought
a colored boy and he took the paper
oat to a young man who sat at the
eastern end of a private wire.
The next thing we knew orders be
gan to come in hot from the presi
dent's office â the president of the
road, if you please â to get that wheat
on the high line into Chicago, and to
get it there quickly.
Trainmen, elevator men. superin
tendents of motive power were spur
red with special orders and special
bulletins. Farmers, startled by the
great price offering, hauled night and
day. Every old tub we had in the
shops and on the scrap was over
hauled and hustled into the service.
The division danced with excitement.
Every bushel of wheat on it must be
in Chicago by the morning of Mav 31.
For two weeks we worked every
thing to the limit; the skyscraper led
any two engines on the line. Even
Dad Hamilton was glad to cry enough
and Uike a helper. We doubled them
every day and the way the wheat flew
over the line toward the lower end
of Lake Michigan was appalling to
speculators. It was a battle between
two commercial giants, and a battle
to the death. It shook not alone the
country, it shook the world; but that
was nothing to us; our orders were
simply to move the whfeat. And the
wheat moved.
The last week found us pretty well
cleaned up, but the high price brought
grain out of cellars and wells, the
buyers said â ct least, it brought all
the hoarded wheat and much of the
seed wheat, and the 2Sth day of the
month found fifty cars of wheat still
in the Zanesville yards. I was at Har
vard working on a time card when the
word came, and behind it a special
from the general manager, stating
there was a thousand dollars premium
in it for the company, besides tariff.
if we got that wheat into Chicago by
Saturday morning.
The train end of it didn't bother me
any; It was the motive power that
kept us studying. However, we fig
ured that by running McNeal with the
skyscraper back v.ild we could pull
all the wheat behind her In one train.
As it happened Neighbor was at Har
vard, too.
"Can they ever get over Beverly
with fifty. Neighbor?" I asked doubt
fully.
"We'll never know till they try It,"
growled Neighbor. "There's a thou
sand for the company if they do, that's
all. How'H you run them? Give them
plenty of searoom; they'll have to
gallop to make it."
Cool and reckless planning, taking
the daring cha'nees, straining the flesh
and blood, driving the steel loaded to
the snapping point, thaj; was what It
.meant. But the company wanted re
sults; wanted the prestige and the
premium, too. To gain them we were
expected to stretch our little resources
to the uttermost.
I studied a minute, then turned to
the dispatcher.
"Tell Norman to send.them out as
second 4; that gives the right of way
over every wheel against them. If
they can't make it on that kind of
schedule it isn't in the track."
It was extraordinary . business,
rather, sending a train" ' of. wheat
through on a passenger schedule,
practically, as the second section of
our eastbound flyer; but we took halr-
Hf ting chances on the plains.
It was noon when the. orders were
flashed. At 3 o'clock No. 4 was due
to leave Zanesville. For three, hours
I kept the wires busy warning - all
operators and trainmen, even -switch
engines and yard masters, of the wheat
special second 4.
The flyer, the first section and reg
ular passensrer train, .was checked out
of Zanesville on time. â¢ Second - 4,
Â¦which meant Georgie McNeal, - Dad,
the skyscraper S and j fifty loads of
men waiting next behind. .Then Neigh
bor pulled Dad .back, blind now and
senseless. When they got the old fire
man out he made a pitiful struggle to
pull himself together. He tried to stand
up, but .the sweat broke over him and
he sank in a heap at Neighbor's feet.
That was the saving of George Mc-
Neal and. out there they will still tell
you about that lift of Dad Hamil
ton's. '
We nut him on the cot at the hos
pital next to his engineer. Georgie,
dreadfully bruised and scalded, came
on fast in spite of bis hurts. But' the
doctor said Dad had wrenched a ten
don in that frightful effort, and he lay
there a very sick and very old man
long after the young engineer was up
and around telling of his experience.
-"When we cleared the chutes I saw
white signals, I thought," he said to
me at Dad's bedside, "I knew we had
the right-of-way over everything. It
was a hustle, anyway, on that sched
ule, Mr. Reed; you know that; an aw
ful hustle with . our load. I never
choked her a notch to run the yards;
didn't mean to do it with the Junction
grade to climb just ahead of us. But
I looked * out again, and by hokey! I
thought I'd gone crazy, got color blind,
red signals! Of course, I thought I
must have been wrong the first time
I looked. I choked her; I threw the
aid; I dumped the gravel. Heavens!
she never felt it! . I couldn't figure how
we were wrong.: but there was the red
light. I yelled: 'Jump, Dad!' and he
yelled: 'Jump, son!' Didn't you. Dad?
' "He Jumped; but I wasn't. ever going
to jump and my engine, going full
against a red lamp. Not much;
"I kind of dodged down behind. the
head; when she struck it was biff, and
she Jumped â¢ about .twenty feet up

like it. Then it was" biff, biff, biff,

Isn't that better?- Poor Musgrave!"
he' added, speaking of the engineer
of 55, who was instantly- killed. "He
Crouching an instant, the giant mus
cles of his back set in a tremendous
effort. The wreckage snapped and
groaned, the knotted legs slowly and
painfully . straightened, the cab for a
passing instant rose. in the air and in
that â¢ instant Neighbor dragged Â¦ George
McNeal from out the vise of death and
passed â¢* him, like a pinch-bar, to ' the

ants hurried away together. When* I
reached the skyscraper, buried in the
thick of the smash, roaring like a vol
cano, thes^air were already, into the
jam like a brace of ferrets, hunting for
the engine crews. . -It seemed an hour,
though it was much less, before they
found any one. Then they brought out
55's fireman. Neighbor found him. But
his back was broken. Back again they
wormed through twisted trucks, under
splintered beams, . in and around and
overchoked -with heat, blinded by
steam, 'shouting as they groped, listen
ing for word or cry or gasp.
Soon we heard Dad'a voice in a dif
ferent cry â one that meant everything;
and the wreckers, turning like beavers
through a dozen blind trails, gathered
all close to. the big fireman. He was
under a great piece of the cab, where
none could follow, and he was crying
for a bar. They passed him a bar.
Other men, careless of life and limb,
tried to crawl under and in to him; but
he warned them back. Who but a man
baked twenty years in an engine cab
could stand the steam that poured â¢ on
him where he lay? ,
Neighbor, just outside, flashing a
light,' heard the labored strain of his
breathing; saw him getting half up,
bend to the bar and saw the Iron give
like lead i in his hands as he pried
mightily. gS .
Neighbor' heard, and he told me long:
afterward, how the old man flung the
bar away with an imprecation, - and
cried for one. to help him; for a minute
meant a life now â the boy lying pinned
under the shattered cab was roasting

we worked on our time card. Neigh
bor, in -the dispatcher's office across
the hall, figured out that the wheat
train would enrich the. company just
eleven thousand Â¦ "* dollars, tolls and
premium. "If it; doesn't break in two
on the Beverly Hill," growled Neigh
bor, with a qualm.
On the dispatcher's sheet, which Is
a sort of a panorama, I watched the
big train whirl past station after sta
tion, drawing Eteadily nearer to us,
and doing it, the marvel, on full pas
s^n?er time. It was a great feat, and
Georgie. McNeal, whose "nerve and
brain were guiding the tremendous
load, was breaking records with every
milestone. ,
They were due In Harvard at 9
o'clock/ The first 4, our flyer, pulled in
and out on time, meeting 55, the west
bound overland freight, at the second
-station east 'of Harvard â Redbud.
Neighbor and I sat with the dls
'patchers, up in their office smoking.
The wheat train was now due from the
west, and, looking* at my watch, I
stepped to the western window. Almost
immediately I heard the long peculiarly
hollow blast of the skyscraper whis
tling for the upper yard.
"She's coming," I exclaimed.
The boys crowded to the window, but
Neighbor happened to glance to the
east.
"What's that coming in from the
junction. Bailey?" he exclaimed, turn
ing to the local dispatcher. We looked
and saw a headlight in the east.
"That's 55." *
"Where do they meet?"
"Fifty-five takes the long -siding in
from the junction" â which was two
miles east â "and she ought to be on
it right now/' added the dispatcher.
anxiously looking over the - master
mechanic's shoulder.
NeiEhbor Jumped as if a bullet had
struck him. "She'll never take a siding
to-night. She's coming down the main
track. What's her orders?" he demand
ed, furiously.
"Meeting orders for first 4 at Redbud,
second 4 here, 78 at Glencoe. Great
Jupiter!" cried the dispatcher, and his
face went sick and scared, "they've
forgotten second 4."
"They'll think of her a long time
doad," roared the master mechanic,
savagely. Jumping to the west- window.'
"Throw your red. lights! There's^ the
skyscraper bovj;!" - - .
Her head*^shot that instant around
the coal chutes, less than a. mile away,
and on going dead against her. I stood
like one palsied, my' eyes glued on the
burning eye of the big engine. As she
whipped past a street arc light I
caught a glimpse of Georgie McNeal's
head out of the cab. window. He al
ways rode bareheaded if the night was
warm/ and I knew it was he; but sud
denly, like a flash, his head went in.
I knew why as well as if my eyes were
his eyÂ«?s and ray thoughts his thoughts.
He h3d seen red signals' where he had
every right to look for white.
But red signals now â to stop her â to
pull her flat on her haunches like a
bronco? Shake a. weather flag at a
cyclone!
I saw the fire stream from her driv
ers; I knew they were churning in the
sand; I knew he had twenty air cars
behind him sliding. What of it?
Two thousand tons were sweeping
forward like an avalanche. What did
brains or pluck count for now with
55 dancing along like a school girl
right into the teeth of it.
I don't know how the t/tner men felt.
As for me, my breath choked in my
throat, my knees shook, and a deadly
nausea seized me. Unable to avert the
horrible blunder, I saw its hideous re
sults.
Darkness hid the worst of the sight;
it was the" sound that appalled.' Chil
dren asleep in sod shanties miles from
where the two engines reared in awful
shc-ck, Jumped in their â¢ cribs at that
crash. ' 55"s little engine, barely checked
the skyscraper. She split it like a
banana. She bucked like . a frantic
horse and leaped fearfully ahead. There
was a blinding explosion, a sudden
awful burst of steam; trie windows
crashed about our ears, and we were
dashed to the wall and floor like lead
pencils. A baggage truck, whipped up
from the platform below, came through
the heavy sash and down on the dis
patcher's table like a brickbat, and as
we scrambled to our feet a shower of
wheat suffocated us. The floor heaved;
freight cars slid into the depot like bat
tering-rams. In the height of the con
fusion an oil tank in the yard took fire
and threw a yellow glare on the ghast
ly scene.
I saw men get up and fall again to
their knees; I was - shivering and wet
with sweat The stairway was crushed
into kindling wood. I climbed out a
back window, down on the roof of the
freight platform and so to the ground.
There was a running to and fro, use
less and aimless. Men were beside
themselves. They plunged through
wheat up to their knees at every step.
All at once, above the frantic hissing
of the buried Skyscraper and the wild
calling of the car tinks, I heard the
stentorian tones of Neighbor, mounted
on a twisted truck, organizing the men
at hand into a wrecking gang. Soon
people began running up the yard to
where the skyscraper lay, like another
Samson, prostrate in the midst of the
destruction it had wrought. Foremost
among the excited men, covered with
dirt and blood, staggered Dad Hamil
ton. '
"Where's McNeal?" cried Neighbor.
Hamilton pointed to the wreck.
"Why didn't he jump?" yelled Neigh
bor. . '
Hamilton pointed at the twisted sig
nal tower. The red light still burned
In. it. :
"You changed the signals on him!"
he cried - savagely. "What does it
mean? We had rights against every
thing. What does it- mean?" he raved,
in a frenzy. "
â¢ Neighbor answered him never a
word. He only put his hand on Dad'a
shoulder.
"Find him firstâ find him!" he re
peated, with a strain In his voice I

over horses and marvel at it when I
think cf the iron horse. I hear them
Â«. hatter of distance, and my mind turns
to the annihilatcr. I hear them brag
cf shirs, and I think of the ship that
plov.s the mountains and rivers and
plains. And when they talk of speedâ
what can I think of but her?
As the new engine rolled into the
yards, ir.y heart beat quicker. Her
lines were too imposing to call strong:
they were massive, yet so simple you
could draw them, like the needle snout
of a collie, to a very point.
Every bearing looked precise, every
joint looked supple, as she swept mag
nificently vp and checked herself, pant
ing:, in front of us.
Fo'.ey was in the cab. He had been

She was built in Pennsylvania, but
the fellows on the Missouri end of our
line thought nothing could ever safely
be put into our hands until they had
stopped it en route and looked it over.
â¢How does she run, Foley?" asked
Neighbor, gloating silently over the
toy. ' â¢
"Cool as an ice-box," said Foley,
swinging down. "She's a regular sum
rr.cr resort Little stiff on the hills
yet.**
"We'll take that out of her." mused
Neighbor, climbing into the cab to look
her over. "Boys, this is up in a bal
loon." he added, pushing his big head
through the cab window and peering
down at the ninety-inch drivers under
him.
"I grew dizzy once or twice looking
for the nonies," declared Foley. biting
off a piece of tobacco as he hitched at
his overalls. "She looms like a sky
scraper. Say, Neighbor, I'm to get her
myself, ain't IT" asked Foley, with his
usual nerve.
"When McNeal gets through with
her. yes." returned Neighbor gruffly.
giving her a thimble of steam and try
ing the air.
"What:" cried Foley. affecting sur
prise. "You going to give her to the
kid ?"
"I am," returned the master me
chanic unfeelingly, and he kept his
v.ord.
Georgie SIcNeal, just reporting for
work after the session in his cab with
the loose end of a connecting rod, was
invited to take out the skyscraper â
4SS, cla^s H â as she was listed, and
Dad Hamilton, of course, took the
scoop to fire her.
"They get everything good that's
going." grumbled Foley.
"They are good people," retorted
Neighbor. He also assigned a helper
tr the old fireman. It was a new thing
with us then, a fellow with a slicebar
to tickle the grate, and Dad, of course,
kicked. He always kicked. If they
hafl raised his salary he would have
kicked. Neighbor wasted no words.
He eimply eer.t the helper back to
wiping until the old fireman should cry
er.ough. ' *
VÂ»ry likely you know that a new
engine must be regularly broken, as a
. horse is broken, before it is ready for
ttendy, hard work. And as Georgie
JJcNeal was not very strong yet. he
was ji ppointed to do the breaking.
For two months it was & picnic.
Light rur.s and easy lay-overs. After
the smash at the Narrows, Hamilton
had sort of taken the kid engineer un
der fcls wing, and it was prettygener
ijly understood that any one who
elbowed Georgie McXeal must reckon
with his doughty old fireman. So the
two tised to march up and down the
street together, as much like chums
as a very young engineer and a very
old fireman possibly could be. They
talked together, walked together and
ate together. Foley was as Jealous as
a czt of Hamilton, because he had
brought Georgie out West and felt a
port or guardiin interest In that quar
ter himself. Really, anybody could
jove Georgie McNeal; old Dad Hamil
ton was j^roof cno'.iYh cf that.
One evening. Just after pay day, I
saw the pair in the postofSce lobby
getting their checks cashed. Present
ly the two stepped over to the money
order window; a moment later each
came back with a money order.
''Is that where you leave your

up. to speak to me.

Magnetic North" lays claim to con
sideration aa one of the really solid
novels of the year. >
As comparison with Jack London's
Alaskan stories is, of course, inevitable
in the consideration of Miss Robins'
novel, it is well to make such at the
outset so that suggested elements of
contrast made manifest by closer view
of the story's detail may be better
comprehended. At first off this one
fact appeals: that woman though the
author is, her book has nothing of the
womanly in its spirit. It softens noth
ing, skips nothing, colors nothing with
the delicateness of femininity nor
cloaks anything with a veil of
woman's finer sensibilities. " The
Magnetic North" is masculine
to the core. It " has to deal
with men In a man's struggle.
In this It yields nothing to the virulent
man-strength of Jack (London. The
powerful masculine spirit of Mrs.
Steel's stories of the Mutiny Is dupli
cated in Mies Robins' .book. In this
element, subtle and difficult of exact
definition, does "The Magnetic North"
differ : from ."The Call of the Wild";
the element of the heart. Jack Lon
don's men are all bone and sinew, In
spired by London's own characteristic
concept of life as the eternal tooth
and-claw rending and tearing wKereby
only the fittest Burvlve. London finds
in man the animal "always, the spirit
rarely. Miss Robins sees in her men
of the. north brutality, yes, but more:
a fine essence of the soul, of th.e some
thing ' which we are, glad to believe
makes man a little lower than the
angels rather than a little higher than
the anthropoid apes. London's stories
are soulless; Miss Robins' is warm with
trust in the God-given spark of ex
altation above the beasts given â¢ to
the creatures made in His image. '
Not all to the grim terror and .the
fcllnd fate of the great north is "The
Magnetic North".. devoted, nor Is the
spirit of the book that of ceaseless
battling , against . the relentless hidden
springs of relentless - natural force.
Man is not pitted against the white
silence, fighting for a foothold and a
freehold. Bloody sweat does not reek
from every page of the book. The
story is not about men made strange
new creatures, half beast, in the
strange land under the aurora, but on
the contrary, It follows the fortunes
of normal men who ; remain normal
enough under the unwonted condi
tions of the new land, changing only
as they fit themselves to their sur
roundings. There " are tragic uplifts
to, the tale, but it is not all tragedy.
The "colonel" from Kentucky, the
"boy" from Florida, Potts, the Den
ver bank clerk; MacCann, the Nova
Scotia school master, and O'Flynn,
lawyer, of San Francisco â these are
the five men, gathered from five cor
ners of the continent, whose fortunes
are followed through Miss Robins*
tale. Thrust by the icy hand of win
ter into a cabin of their own building
on tne bank of the lower .Yukon, these
upon Alaska. Indeed, that land of
the ice and the grim stalking death
which . yielded to this young man
treasures not of gold has had no other
interpreter in fiction worthy of note
until the present. Now comes a
woman, Elizabeth Robins, with a
novel of remarkable power, "The Mag
netic North," to divide if not to con
test this literary field with the young"
Callfornian. For there is ample room
for a division of the Alaskan bread
that has hitherto been the whole loaf
to London. That a woman. should bo
the Oiie to essay a tala of the north
ern gold fields which reflects so much
of actual experience and personal ob
servation as does "The ! Magnetic
North" is more remarkable than the
fact, that therein is something which
must share honors with "The Call of
the Wild" or "The God of His
Fathers." â¢
In' "By Snare of Love" Arthur W.
Marphmont has turned out another of
his semi-annual productions In thu
breathless, reckless fiction line. The
itory has to do with a young Ameri
can-who 1 ' obtains â¢ a concession for a
small province in Turkey, hoping
there "to- establish an Industrial com
munity which may be the leavening
spot for a possible regeneration of the
whole country. H'. obtains his con
cession all right and everything is
working smoothly when the hero
blunders into the inevitable snare of
love that is set for the sons of Adam.
He becomes the catspaw, for a parcel
of, low-browed revolutionists, incurs
the wrathful revenge of the Sultan

flame of a new era conviction against
encompassing hosts of conventional
morality and acceptors.
As It is. however, its scintilating as
sault may more amuse than menace
society as at present constituted. . Mr.
Shaw is not taking himself seriously,
nor presenting opinions of more impor
tance than that of being the mere ve
hicle of the author's wit. It is a fine
example of a man so rejoicing in the
possession of a brilliant brain, and the
exercise and revelation of it, that in
stead of his brilliance being obedient
servant to his will in the execution of
*ome Eeriuus purpose, it makes his
work subservient to the mere display
of its sparkling. .'â¢ ,'K
The book consists of three parts:.
First, a very long letter in whicn the
author explains that he Is writing a
modern Dun Juan fctory at the request
cf a. friend. Second, .i sort of allegori
cal play, -'a comedy and a philosophy,"
in which the -principal exponent of the
revolutionary views is John -Tanner.,
which is English for Don Juan Ten
or io. Third, there is appended the. re
volutionist's handbook written by John
Tanner, "wherein you will find the pol
itics of the eex question as I conceive
Don Juan's descendant to understand
them. Not that I disclaim the fullest
responsibility for his opinions andfor
those of all my characters, pleasant
and unpleasant. They are all right
from their several points of view, f â¢ â¢
This may puzzle people who belieVe
that there is 6uch a thing as an abso
lutely right point of view." Mr. Shaw
tells us that instead of following the
common practice of romancers of an
nouncing that their hero is a man of
extraordinary genius and leaving his
works entirely to the reader's imagin
ation, he actually gives you the writ-
Ing, which is very naive and nervy, but
it sounds all right from Shaw.
The two main things which the revo
lutionary .thought of this modern Don
Juan (note that he Is not. a Don Juan
in the old sense, but a comparatively
tame and pious person) deals with are
property and marriage. In .the., epistol
ary preface this excuse for vagary waa
given: "Every man who records his il
lusions Is providing data for the genu
ine scientific psychology which the
world still waits for." We are told that
there is no future for men who are
neither Intelligent, nor politically.edu
cated enough to be socialists. There is
much about good breeding, and- when
Shaw uses the . term "gpod breeding"
he means eugenics. ''Â¦-â¢ â¢;â¢ If the.
Superhuman is to come, he must be
born of Woman by Man's Intentional
and well-considered contrivance. Con
viction of this will smash everything
that opposes it, even property and mar
riage, . â¢ Â¦ â¢ â¢ when it becomes a. fully
realized vital purpose of the race."
The mating of uncongenial spirits
Â¦would often be a cross productive of
finer types, and, as marriage between
euch would be most unhappy, he would
have for the nonce conjunction without
marriage, but yet retain marriage for
the sake of domesticity.
Hence It would seem that the modern
Don John Tanner would In the process
of breeding the Superman .eliminate
jealousy, from his make-up. The plan
must surely Involve the abrogation â¢ of
that old Scripture that "love is strong
as death, and jealousy is as cruel as the
grave." But -probably we . need never
doubt that Nature intends rather to
produce the Superman with mingled
stupidity and jealousy rather than the
â¢superlative intellectual without it; so
the John Tanner way to such general
production of the Superman will be
barred by the jealous hand which will
put the supersire up against the exter
minating gun., and. in order to make
security doubly sure that no such types
are brought forth, may shoot also the
brilliant embryo and Its matrix back to
the chaos whence they sought to
evolute; like Francesca, to love for
ever elsewhere, but not to rock the
cradle here.
The most uncompromising thing
that can be said of the book is that
It Is exceeding full of cerebration. It
makes you sit up and listen even when
you don't- like it It flashes,- but it's
flippant. In It" wisdom is twist awry
to let wit have the right of way. Its
purpose, if it has any, is too much
subordinate to play, and it. borders

' A PECULIARLY difficult character
*Â» to analyze is that about which W.

are men whose conscious acts of de
ception and of equivocation are care

deceives himself alike with others, and
whose deceit is sul generia a thing of

standpoint of literary workmanship.
Norris' analysis of this character is

Through the various chameleon-like
changes of heart, that, this moral

dulges himself with, the writer has not
missed a shadow of meaning or drop
ped a line of significance. Whether^or
not this perfect portrait will please
must depend., uijon tne. taste of the
reader in the matter of this Intensive
style of fiction writingâ the style that
calls little of incident to the support

Mr. Harold Dunville is an actor of
no little worth on. the stage and qf
consummate 'skill when off. We are
first introduced tÂ» him when he is just
drawing to a close ills' very successful
season and wondering how he can hide
himself on his vacation so that Miss
Lorna Fitzwalter, his leading; lady and
devoted lover, , may not .t bother him.
Chance, in the guise of his mother's
sudden death, calls Dunville from Lon
don to his old Irome in Kent and there
he believes that he falls in love with
a little rosebud of a country girl who,
like the lamented Fitzwalter. loses her
heart instanter. Enters then the third
young lady, Josephine Gardiner, rich,
worldly wise ifhd world-stale. The
reader cannot conjure up a dilemma
more perplexing than was that of the
hero. But the * hero takes a course
which the reader might well eschew.
From love to politics the change is
made with results little more encour
aging. People begin "to find out," the
hero last of all. At last the author has
his creature creation taKe a course
vainly, melodramn^'c. vainly propitiat
ing. Harold Dunville dies, true to his
nature, In a foolish self-sacrifice, which
may be lauded in the papers for a day
âand then forgotten.
Above the superficiality and the triv

there may be found by those that are

a **i ALT!" The command rang
* * I \ out sharply and the figure
J 1 skulking through the rice
J field hesitated, then turned
and came slowly toward the sentinel.
It was clad in the uniform of a com
mon soldier.
The sergeant of the guard was
near and to him the man was trans
ferred and taken directly to the tent
of the commanding officer.
â¢A deserter, your distinguished
highness," the sergeant reported, sa
luting.
The officer looked up from a chess
board on which he had been maneu
vering men in lines of battle. He was
a strong, handsome fellow, with a
hard face. As his eyes fell upon the
prisoner he started slightly.
"You. Kurino?" he exclaimed. The
prisoner smiled satirically.
"Even I, Shihiro," he answered,
"though I suppose I ought t*Â» *dd "no
ble and distinguished highness, now
that you are an officer.*'
The other waved his han >a
tiently.
"You may go," he said to the ser
geant, "I wish to speak with the pris
oner alone a few minutes." Then, ?.
the sergeant withdrew, "You under
stand what this involves?"
"Of course, ' c<*ldly; "deserting is
death. "'
"Yes, ceath." grimly, "and I will
see that the penalty is paid to-morrow
morning at sunrise. But greater than
death, you have the disgrace of de
serting. That will go with you into
the grave and out to darken the

ENDERBY'S WAY
Then he sauntered to the window to
look over at the skyscraper across the
way. where at a certain window, in a
certain tier." he had often seen a cer
tain head. It was a shapely head,
ringleted as close as a baby's with
sunny brown curls. Indeed, so fre
quently of late'had he gone to his own
casement to discover if that particular
bonnle head and rose-leaf face were
within range of his vision that his
business began to suffer from such
erratic absences.
Not that Jack Berenson was bother
ing himself about business. During
those minutes he^ stood, absorbed in
day-dreams, staring apparently at the
uninteresting wall of an uninteresting
building. He was thinking for the most
par V how strange it was that he. who
had come gayly up the road of life,
heart-whole and fancy free, until he
had reached his thirtieth milestone,
should all at once be beset by the
most chimerical hopes, the most futile
desires, the most glorious if chaotic
Imaginings.
It was lunacy, he told himself â stark,
staring lunacyâ that he should go on
his way wjth a bounding heart and a
feelins of the most senseless exhilara
tion, just because he had passed a
girlish* figure oh the sidewalk, met the
indifferent glance of violet, black
lashed eyes, looking forth from beneath
a white brow, or caught the faint, elu
sive perfume of her demure garments.
And the worst of it was that he could
not bring himself to be indignant with
himself for being such a fool!
Â¦Â¦-. VYou like to be a fool!" he told him
self angrily. "You're "hugging your
"It was mlghtv muddy, too!" he
commented disgustedly. -\ .<
This accusation could not be made
against it an hour later, cleansed and
polished to the highest possible de
gree by the man ,who kept the shoe
stand in the office building where
Berenson had a suite. He took his
prize upstairs, and deposited it,
wrapped in tissue paper, on the top of
his desk.
folly! And much good it will do you!
You've not got enough sense. Jack
Berenson, to last a crazy man till
breakfast time!" .
With which final shot he was apt to
break away from his. vigil, return
sternly to his desk, and plunge Into
work until-until he began to wonder
it she.might have returned to her chair
in the window â or by any chance be
going out. Though whether out or in.
there had seemed sUght chance of mak
ing her acquaintance before Fate, in
the guise of a treacherous street cross
ing, had placed a belonging of hers in
his possession. .
But when he had sallied forth with
his prize his courage almost failed him.
And when , the elevator man let him off
at the eighth floor, as bidden, it was
an insane desire to make his imme
diate escape by way of the staircase
that overwhelmed him. But he pulled
himself together and went toward the
suite of doctors' offices which he knew
occupied that particular angle of the
big building. Some of the physicians
whose names were inscribed on the
tablet inMhe corridor were friends of
his. S
"Hope I don't run into Norton, or
Schrlener. or Maclntyre," he said.
"Hope I don't."
But he didâ all three of them. They
and a few of their professional asso
ciates had met in the reception-room
previous to attending a medical con
vention -in a body. It seemed to poor
Berenson, standing helplessly in the
doorway with his package In his hand,
that the place was packed with eyes
curious, inquisitive, mocking eyes!
But a few voices called out pleasant
ly enough, "Halloâ how d'ye do. Beren
son?" And Maclntyre came forward
Â¦with a smile that made his ugly coun
tenance\qulte charming.
"Yourâthe young ladyâ" stammered
Jack. He held out the package much
as though it were a letter of introduc
tion." "She lost this, and-V"
"Oh. I see!" The i--Â»tor turned hast

Berenson let the dray pass. Look-
Ing down directly on the. spot where
the girl had hesitated, he saw that
which had arrested her, and bending
quickly, he pulled out of the thick,
black, sticky mud an absurdly small
rubber, with its wrinkles holding the
arch of a high little instep.
"Well!" he ejaculated. ' "Here's
luck!"
He felt ridiculously elated. So
pleased did he look, . in fact; that a
friend jostling him as he reached the
opposite sidewalk, remarked- his satis
faction.
"Wheat cone up, Berenson?"
."Noâ rubber!" laughed Berenson.
And his friend walked off wondering
what there was in fishing footwear
out of the mire to make a -fellow look
so idiotically pleased.

the extent of their acquaintance.
He had groaned more than once to
think conventionality forbade a more
extended one. She was not the kind
of a girl with whom one might scrape
up a bowing recognition, to be later
elaborated in an exchange of com
monplaces that might culminate in
permission to call. Indeed, if she had
been, "it is safe to conclude Berenson
would not have troubled his head
about her, for he had a social posi
tion to maintain, a good deal of per
sonal pride and more than the aver
age sense of exclusiveness.
"Halloa!" -he said suddenly, and
stopped short.
The girl ahead had paused. " She
was evidently in some predicament.
For she stooped as though to extricate
herself or to pick up an article drop
ped. Almost at the same instant, how
ever; a tremendous dray, piled with
boxes, bore down upon her, and at the
shout of the driver, who i was ; striv

she sprang toward safety and reached

ever without her hat and coat. Her
soft, green gown fitted her as Its sheath
fits a flower.- And the pretty, bewil

more than ever like violet stars.
Berenson knew then how a man felt

cannon's mouth.

"Have you thought it over?" said
he.
Now this question was entirely ir
relevant to the talk of the moment.
"Have I thought what over?" Miss*
Carmichael asked.
"Marrying me?" said Enderby terse
ly. "I'm a very practical manâ not
romantic and that sort of thing, you
know. Still, I flatter myself I'd make
a fairly good husband. You'd have a
house and servants very much like this
establishment here."
Miss Carmlchael's eyes opened
wide. Was ever a girl wooed in such
cold-blooded fashion, she wondered.
She spoke calmly, yet her voice was
not as firm as she intended.
"Mr. Enderby, I thoroughly respect
you, but' as for marrying you â "
She paused and Enderby went on.
"Perhaps you want to think It over
a little longer. That will be all right.
I'm not one of the Impatient sort.
Good-night." ;*::

hat and stick, and departed leaving '.l.e

wrath. Tii : .
Spring was well advanced before En
derby broached the subject again. It
was one evening Just as he was about
to depart from the Carmichaels, and it
was with the usual abruptness.
"Have you decided to marry me
yet?" said he.
Miss Carmichael looked at' him
steadily, and this time her .voice was
_xery firm.
"No, Mr. Enderby, I have not; nor
do I think 1 ever shall decide to mar
ry you."
"That's all right," said he.
At the door he turned.
"If you should change your mind let
me know." ,,
To this day Miss Carmichael is un
decided whether the tears she shed
were of mirth or of anger. She felt
certain thie was the end of it; but En
dtrby came as heretofore to take her
driving, or to the theater, or to ves
pers on a pleasant Sunday. His man
ner was quite unchanged; it was as If
nothing whatever had happened.
Summer came, and the Carmichaels
left the city for their pretty country
place in a quiet village. Every sec
ond Saturday Enderby came down to
And thenâ perhaps something in
her voice suggested the course â En
derby tempted fate once more. â¢
"Going to marry me?" he said.
Miss Carmichael laughed hysteric

"Of course I am, you funny man,"
Bhe said. "How on earth can I help
myself?" ,_
Enderby looked puzzled.
"You're quite sure you want to?"
he asked doubtfully. *â¢
"Very, very sure,, dear," said Mis3
Carmichael gravely.
"Good! Good . enough!" said En
derby with hearty, satisfaction. It was
Enderby's way.
, "Oh!" said Miss Carmichael in tones
of relief, "he was positively insulting.
I'm bo glad you came."
"That's all right," said Enderby.
That Saturday afternoon Miss Car
michael was alwne in the house. At
4 o'clock a tree agent came to the
door, and by persistent efforts to sell
his goods was making himself very
obnoxious. At this juncture Ender
by came up the walk. .He heard the
voices in the hall and took In the
situation at a glance. He laid a hand
none too gently on the agent's shoul
der.
"You're annoying the lady," said
Enderby severely.
"Is that any of your business?"
said the man, with heated insolence.
"None at all," said Enderby cheer
fully. Whereupon he took the man
by the collar, marched him to the
porch and helped his undignified re
treat to the graver walk.
The agent rose from the ' gravel,
sputtering -profane Invective. Ender
by started down the steps.
â¢' Haven't had enough, eh?" said he,
and something in his tone and ex
pression forced upon the irate agent's
understanding a realization of the bet
ter part of valor. He fled the field in
inglorious haste. Enderby returned

dine with them. The portly head of
the house of Carmichael entertained
a genuine and outspoken liking for the
reserved young man, and Mrs. Car
michael was voluble in his praises.
Miss Carmichael said nothing, but
she recognized some potent fascina
tion about this strange, reticent man
and his stranger method of wooing.
Sometimes it amused her; sometimes
it angered her; and yet his plain words
and his frank strength appealed to her
more strongly than she cared to ad
mit. What manner of man was this,
she asked herself countless times; and
each time a definite ans\ver_was want
ing.
(Copyright. 1304, by T. C. McClure.)
* T was eminently characteristic of
I Enderby. He had known Miss Car-
I michael scarcely three months, but
to Enderby's mind time was not
always measured by the clock.
They were walking homeward from
the opera. Miss Carmichael had in
sisted that they walk; it was a perfect
night and the distance home was short.
"When they entered the quiet street
where Miss Carmichael lived Enderby
fell into a brown study. The girl be
side hifn was talking in eprightly fash
ion of nibelungs and Rhinemaidens, all
of which was lost to Enderby's ears.
They had reached the substantial Car
znichael residence, when Enderby came
suddenly from his reticent silenceâ so
suddenly, indeed, that he Interrupted
the gfrl in the middle of a sentence.
"Look here." said he, "I'm a pretty
steady-going sort. I've a fair income
and a steadilv growing clientage. I
want an establishment of my own.
Why wouldn't It be a good idea for us
to marry?"
Miss Carmichael was so thoroughly
astounded that she found no reply un
til they had reached the top step and
Enderby was struggling with the latch
key. ('.
"Good gracious!" was all she man-
Aged to gasp even then.
"I mean it," said Enderby. "Think
It over if you like. .1 don't necessarily
expect my answer right now."
"Good night, Mr. Enderby," she said
rather coolly, and the door swung shut
behind -her. Â¦'.
Enderby strode down the street to
ward the club with never a qualm in
his mind and never a tremor beneath
his immaculate 6hlrt front; but that
was Enderby's way.
After that he saw Miss Carmichael
as usual, and for several weeks made
no allusion to the "matter. At first
the girl was furtively uneasy in his
presence, but as the weeks went by
and he said nothing more, she evi
dently began to think the affair had
passed from his mind. But In that
she misjudged Enderby.

know that I am pursued; still, it is
strange to find me here in America.
I am going to my niece, the Princess
Flavia, who. is now In Chicago." â
There was something grotesque In
this odd jumble of the Hope story and
the American towns. Morgan glanced
apprehensively about the car. There
was no woman to whom he could make
appeal. There were three in the sleep
er, but Morgan knew the type only too
well. One was evidently a traveling
saleswoman, since she fraternized with
the other commercial travelers In the
car and made notes of the points they
offered for her instruction. One was
evidently a soubrette who vied with
the woman drummer for the attention
of 'the men. The third was a young
woman whose very face betokened her
incapacity.
He leaned over to the little Princess.
"It Would be better," he suggested,
"that no one else should know that you
are a Princess. I. too, am going to
Chicago, and will wait upon your com
mands. The others in the car are not
to be trusted, believe me."
"Bless your heart," she fairly beamed
upon- himâ it is not always that her
Rurutarilan subjects yielded this ready
acquiescence â "I don't dare reveal my
self to any but a Rurutanian. Don't
you see" â her voice grew confidential â
"that there is Black Michael in the
smoker? It would never do for him to
realize that I was in this very car,
when he came to* America on purpose
to destroy me. He thinks that with me
out of the way* It would be easy to
marry Flavia. That will nev*- be. I
am determined that she shall marry
Rudolph. That la why I am forced to
flee my own country."
All that long afternoon Morgan hu
mored her whim. It vnild never do to
let her proclaim her royalty to the oth
ers. There was not a single soul in the
crowded Chicago sleeper who would see
the pathos of her condition. Instead
she would be made the object of their
jeers. She was such a dainty little old
lady that he could not bear thÂ« thought
of her being subjected to ridicule.
He took her in to dinner, paying
proper deference to royalty and show
ing that he appreciated the honor of
dining with one of a race of kings.
After that he played piquet with her
until she became sleepy, and it was he
who gave the porter an extra tip to
make her berth down first.
Early the next morning she was In
her seat, smiling and happy, when
Morgan emerged from his berth. She
beckoned to him. "I slept soundly."
she said blithely. "From time to time
I wakened to hear the tramp of my
knight's footsteps in the aisle, and I
knew that the Princess of Rurutania
was safely guarded."
Morgan divined that the awakenings
were due to the stops and that her
knight's footsteps were those of the
porter as he conducted weary travelers
to their berths, but he smiled and said
nothing. .
All the morning he played her favor
ite piquet with her, and in a way it
was a help to him, for it made him
forget that he was on his way to seek
the girl he loved. A few months be
fore "it had been. his duty, as District
Attorney in a town near New York, to

note a second time, then glanced curi
ously at the little woman across the
aisle. There was nothing about her to
suggest the fantastic: She was just a
dainty little old lady, scarcely five feet
tall, with whom Father Time had dealt
gently. Now she was watching him in
a flutter of '.expectation. Surely there
was something odd, butâ Morgan
crossed the aisle.
"How. can I serve you?" he asked,
as he dropped into the seat beside
her. .
She gave a tiny cry of delight. "I
knew I could not be wrong," she said,
glancing apprehensively about the car.
"I knew you were from Rurutania. I
amâ shâ " she lowered her voice,
"Ethel, Princess of the Royal House."
Morgan gave a start.* Here was a
little woman who claimed connection
with a royal family of fiction, yet gave
no indication of the insanity proven
by her. words. She accepted the start
as a tribute to her revelation.
"I do not wonder that you start,"
she said complacently. "You must be

PRINCESS FLAVIA'S BETROTH AIL
By E. Sargent
It was clear that the man had com
mitted the crime, but a clever law
yer had created a feeling of sympathy
/or the criminal, and Irene Osterman
had coldly told him that she could
never accept the love of a man wbt
had sent an Innocent fellow being to
the gallows. .
She had left for Omaha the follow
ing morning, and had not even given
him a chance to plead his cause. He
was on his way there now. in the
hope that a change of scene would
enable him to make a more successful
appeal to her reason.
The breaking of the engagement
had been a terrible shock to him. and
her Highness from Rurutania at last
enabled him to partially forget the pain
that was gnawing at his heart.
Shortly before 3 the train pulled into
the yards at Chicago, and presently
they were In the station after a tedious
journey between lanes of freight and
passenger trains on side tracks. Just
before they arrived the Princess in
sisted upon having his card and his
Chicago address.
"We Rurutanians are so few." she
protested, "that I am unwilling to lose
sight of so faithful a subject."
And unwillingly he had given her his
card with "The Bismarck" hastily pen
ciled in the corner. She would forget
before she had Reached her home, he
argued.
There was a young man at the train
to meet her, and he was warm in his
thanks to Morgan. The young District
Attorney hurried to the hotel that was
to break his travel. Three hours later
a bellboy knocked upon his door ami
handed in a dainty note.
â¢â¢The 'Princess Flavia,' " it read in
unfamiliar hand, "would be glad to
welcome to Chicago the traveler from
â¢Rurutania.' who by his courtesy has
done so much to help the "Princes3
Ethel.' " and . there followed an ad
dress on Michigan avenue.
From curiosity Morgan determined
to follow the odd experience to the
end, and as soon as he could unpack
his dress suit he called a cab and
gave the address.
Arriving he was promptly shown 4
into the parlor and in a moment there
entered a woman whose presence
caused Morgan's heart to thrill. With
a cry of "Irene!" he sprang forward,
and in another moment she was folded
within his arms.
Ten minutes later, when speech was
possible, she explained that the Prin
cess Ethel was her maiden aunt.
whose dementia took the form of the
belief that she was one of the omitted
characters in the Hope novel.
"When I heard from Cousin Jack."
she said gently, "of the man who had
been so kind, I realized that you had
done it to keep her misfortune from
the rest of the car, and a man who can
take all the pains to spare poor
Aunt Ethel cannot be as heartless as
I supposed you were. I realize my
mistake. Morgan. Can you forgive
me?" -"^
A kiss was his only answer, but an
eloquent one. So engrossed were they
that they failed to hear footsteps until
a thin treble was heard announcing.
"Well. I never suspected that you
were the real Rudolph, but I am glad
that my niece came from Omaha to
meet me." .. :. i.

Shihiro's hand trembled -visibly as

j "You are mistaken, Kurino," he said
at length in a low voice. "I did not
have you seized as you think. I did
not even know you were in my com
pany until a few days ago.
"When I discovered you were here,
though. I admit I was glad. It put
you out of my path temporarily, and
there was the chance of your being
killed. And. now this mistake of your3
has solved that part of the problem
permanently. I am. not having you

suffer the same. But in this case."
frankly, "I am glad; though," a note
of doubt coming into his face, "per

darkened. ., . ;?V ',

The .sergeant entered.

In the guardhouse, with the curious,
unfriendly eyes no longer' watching
: him, Kuriho's scornful composure van-
ished. He squatted upon the earthen
floor, with his eyes fixed drearily upon
the little square hole through which
fell a shaft of light- . The hole was too
small for him to squeeze through, and
there was a double guard outside the
door. This was to be the end. not only
of his political advancement in Korea,
but of that sweeter possibility which
he had won and must now lose.
The hours dragged by, until from thÂ«
shifting light he knew that it was after
midnight. Then the door opened and
some one came in. He did not even
turn. It was a guard solicitous for his
safety, or perhaps come to mock him.
"Kurino!" a voice called.
Kurino sprang to his feet, wondering,
for in the voice was the same dreary
hopelessness that he had been feelin?.
"Shihlro!" he exclaimed.
' "Yes, Iâ I have been thinking it over
and It is as you say. Nuyama would
hate me. Here." thrusting a paper into
K^lno's hand. "It is an honorable dis
charge from the army. It will pass you
through the lines. Now go!"
"What." incredulously; "you let me
go free?" .
"Ym, yes," more harshly; "but it is
not for you. It is for Nuyama. Iâ [
love her, too. I would rather die than
for her to think ill of me. Wow go:
Go! *Go!"
At the door Kurino looked back in
voluntarily. Shihlro was squatted
upon the earthen floor, gazing hope
lessly at the little square hole through
which the light dropped.

however, they are too pretty to be put
lightly aside, especially when ingen

bringing out smart variations of the
modes which ob%iate any thought of
monotony. Gored skirts range from
thirteen to one and two piece circular
skirts. While the long sweep is a no
ticeable feature of the dressy gowns,
common sense has ruled in the making
of street costumes. The exaggerated
sweep, which merely served to tire and
soil the wearer of the gown, has been
curtailed to a graceful short sweep
easily controlled, or to the pretty round
length so convenient to the promenader
or business woman. Another point to
remember is this: A style may be sim

failure unless the style and the fabric
of which the garment is composed are

mother and near relatives the problem
of making appropriate gifts.
Any piece of handsome household
linen, from sheets or pillow cases to
lace or embroidered tablecloths or doy
lies, jewels, silverware and choice
fabrics, are eligible for admission to the
dower chest. A fortunate baby recent
ly received the title deed to a valuable
piece of property which Is to become
hers on her twenty-first birthday. This
precious document was sent by a dot
ing grandfather in a beautifully carved
chest which had been in the family for
generations and which still left abund
ant room for more showy gifts.
Another corset cover, made of three
women's embroidered and hemstitched
handkerchiefs, has the initials of the
owner on the fronts. Kimonas. sachet
bags, mouchoir bags and hat pin hold
ers are also made of handkerchiefs. A
pleasing combing negligee was built of
a bis white silk handkerchief, which
had an opening cut in the center to
thrust the head through. It was em
broidered all about the border with
forget-me-nots and bound at the neck
with pale-blue satin ribbon.
Brier stitched buttonhole stitched
and feather stitched lingerie of all sorts
finds ?ts way into the dower chest, and
nothing Is considered of too much trou

chest girl. Â»"*
One autumn bride is making ex
quisite handkerchief lingerie for her
dower chest. A corset cover, for in
stanae. is made of three men's white
hemstitched handkerchiefs, used on
the bias. Each bias hemstitched edge
Is joined by hand made fagoted bead
ing of heavy white crochet silk. A
row of this beading finishes the side
of each front. The beading is also
edged with lace. One row of beading
was used fer the armhole. Two rows
Â¦were used for finishing the top and
four strands of white wash ribbon
were drawn through this. The entire
garment is feather stitched with fine
white silk thread. The Christian name
of the owner is embroidered on the
right-hand side with white silk thread.
dainty bit of nainsook or sheer linen
in her hands, turning by delicate
stitchery her lingerie into beautiful
creatic-ns. . \
The dower chest girl makes all her
bed linen by hand, for she knows that
nothing can take the place of hem
stitched sheets and pillow slips. On
these, too, ehe daintily embroiders her
"crest." whatever it may be. Even
her bolster slips are marvels of dain
tiness, and quite as much care is ex
pended upon them as on the sheets
and pillow cases.
The latest adjunct to such an outfit
was a moucholr bedspread, pillow
shams and dressing table scarf, all
made out of pure embroidered linen
beaded handkerchiefs, such as come
for corset covers. It took twelve dozen
to make the spread, but when it was
finished, with white wash ribbons run
through the beading, it was worthy of
reposing in the dower chest. The pil
low shams and dresser scarf were
made likewise, joined neatly and with?
ribbon run through the beading. The
finishing touch was a fleur de Us de
sign worked in (he center of each
handkerchief.
This same chest contained table
cloths, napkins and doilies, all ex
quisitely hand made and embroidered
with a fleur de 11s design In the cor
ners. There were also embroidered
bands of ribbon for holding each set,
which added to the charm of posses
sion. On these were painted the words
"Towels," "Table Cloths." "Doilies."
etc. There were also "Bridal Sets,"
made In the same way ror holding the
Unrerie. . .
The dower chest girl will be a
feature of the summer. Instead of
the inevitable doily or centerpiece, she
will be seen on the piazza with some
Xext to the question of the chest
itself, the contents are of the most im
portance to the dower chest girl. If
ehe Is thrifty she will turn out many
dainty bits of needlework, in all of
which she will take much pride. It Is
quite the fad at present to hemstitch
linen towels by hand, scallop the hem
and then buttonhole stitch them. The
monogram of the workerâor, better
still, a design of fleur de Ms. sham
rock or clover â is worked in one end
to stamp the owner's individuality.
Even wash cloths are treated in the
same manner.
Another chest was of mahogany,
polished so highly that it reflected
like a mirror. It was perfectly plain
except for brass mountings and the
monogram of its owner In brass at
one end. It and the trays were
lined wth pale blue quilted satin and
delicately scented with sachet pow
der. This chest sat in an alcove in
the hall, which was furnished In ma
hogany, and it gave an air of ele
gance to the room.
These chests may be inexpensively
made, and serve their purpose, or
they may be constructed with a view
to using them as heirlooms, in which
case they are best bound in copper or
brass.
An artistic burnt wood chest was
made out of an old oak bedstead,
which had been in the family so long
that it had become endeared by asso
ciation. It was made to fit under a
wide window, where it served as a
commodious seat. The design was
burned by the girl herself, and was a
conventional one of poppies. sprawled
over the cover and down the sides.
Copper mounting's were used, and a
lock, made after an old-fashioned
model, decorated the front. The
wood was stained to look like weath
ered oak, and the chest itself was
lined with cedar.
Sometimes she- buys her chest
ready-made, but more often she* plans
it herself and has it constructed to
suit her individual preference. If
she is an enthusiast about wood carv
ing, she has her chest handsomely
carved, or does it herself. Her idea
is to have it so decorative that it will
never be awkward or out of place in
the reception hall, living room, bed
chamber, or wherever she may choose
to keep it. for ornament as well as
use. Whether decorated or plain, it
must have her monogTam on it in
silver or copper to match the trim
mings, or carved on it.
oak. carved or plain, to suit her fancy.
In any event, it will be cedar lined
and have cedar trays, the pungent
odor of which moths eschew, and
which clings to the garments she
places therein as persistently as her
favorite sachet perfumes her bureau
drawers.
COUNTRY.â (Hats). I would wait a
few weeks If I were you before I
bought a hat. On account of the Con
clave an *addltional season .has been
decided upon, and you will be able to
get one that has not been lying about
the shops since early spring.
JENNIE.â (Panama Canal). The es
timated cost of the Panama Canal was
5200.0C0.0OO.
MRS. N.â (Perfume). Good perfumes
never fail to be expensive and poor
cnes are an , abomination. However,
get a bottle of violet toilet water and
twenty-five cents' worth of musk.
Pour the musk into the full bottle of
water and then use as you see fit.
You need not be afraid of the musk,
for it merely serves to hold the violet
odor and to add the faintest possible
sweetness of its own. Do not buy
more than a quarter's worth, though.
ALICE.â (Handkerchief). Go to any
good linen house and ask for linen one
yard wide and pay from one dollar to
FLORENCE.â (Bridal Outfit). For a
girl who .wants a plain but good out
fit I should think this about correct.
A smart traveling suit, short of
course: a silk shirtwaist suit, a black
crepe or net that would answer as an
afternoon and an evening gown and
a white wedding gown made of any
of the soft* materials that are so much
In vogue. Have it made so that
you may be able to .wear, it as an
evening gown, for there is little sense
in putting It away and cherishing it.
Two hats, one strictly tailored and the
other soft and fluffy, and oneVlong
loose coat should answer all practical

THE FEEDING OF BABY (Youn^
Mother).â A healthy well-developed
child fifteen months old may be fed
soft-boiled eggs, well cooked cereals,
beef juice, finely minced baked apple,
toast and oven-dried homemade bread,
barley gruel and plenty of pure milk
nnd a moderate amount of cream if it
agrees with the ch!!d. Do not allow the
baby to taste of harmful foods. The
pernicious habit of giving baby "little
tastes" c-f whatever it cries for cannot
be too strongly condemned. It invari
ably results in strife and often in
severe illness. If. as you say, your
maid or nurse has disobeyed you re
peatedly in regard to feeding the baby
she is not fit to have the care of a.
child. Better take this part of the
work in your own hards and thus
kno-w what your baby eats. (2) â To
make barley gruel, put ouo teaspoonful
of barley flour into the upper pan of
the double boiler and rub to a smooth
paste with a little cold water; then
stir in one pint of boiling water and
boll for twenty minutes. If a double
boiler Is not used, the cruel must be
stirred almost constantly to prevent
scorching. Add a small pinch of salt
and at feeding time mix equal parts
of hot (not boiled) milk and the gruel
together. (3) â Do not think of resort
ing to soothing syrups and similar
drugs when baby is fretful. Discover
the cause and relieve it if possible.
If it i3 a question simply of temper,
firm discipline will soon teach the little
mite to be cheerful when its needs are
well attended to. To keep up a con
tinual series of rocking, tafking and
feeding is not only highly injurious to
the child, but makes a perfect slave of
both mother and nurse. As soon as a
child learns that willful crying avails
it nothing it will soon turn its atten
tion to something else. Thi3 part of
the training cannot be begun too early.
FASHIONABLE DRESS SKIRTS
(Marion). â The styles of dres3 skirts
are so varied that no woman need be
unbecomingly gowned if she will select
wisely only such styles as are best
suited to her form. The stout woman
should not adopt the fad of the season,
the 1830 skirt, with side and back gores
gathered at the top. but this style is
admirably suited to the slender woman.
1'lalted and shirred effects still obtain.
TTVO .DELICIOUS SALADS. (Mrs.
L. G-). â As you are so tired of heavy
meat salads why not try a dainty fruit
and nut or celery and fruit mixture?
Daintily served, with a plain mayon
naise or with an admixture of whipped
cream. It will !*Â» quite rich enough to
suit rour husband and the friends hÂ»
is to entertain at the stag dinner; fur
thermore, it will afford a refreshing va
riety after the elaborate meat courses.
Two excellent recipes are here given.
The ingredients. n!ates. salad bowls,
etc.. should be kept ice-cold until the
moment of serving. Cut with a sharp
knife enough perfectly blanched celery
in fine rings to fill a quart measure.
Peel and cut In very small pieces
enough Greening apples to measure one
pint. The apples should be firm and
tart. Then take one pint of freshly
prated cocoanut. mix with the other in
gredients and moisten with dressing
consisting of one part rluh whipped
cream to three rarts of mayonnaise
dressing. Serve on delicate heart leaves
of lettuce garnished with quarters of
pitted olives. A fruit and nut salad is
made of six tart oranges and one pint
of English walnut meats, moistened
with mayonnaise dressing and served
on lettuce leaves. Pee! anl pull the sec
tions arart. remove the seeds and ail
fibrous white skin from the oranges,
frying careful not to press out the juice.
With a sharrÂ« knife cut out the sec
tions in small nieces; chon the walnut
meat3. Mix <he cut orange and wal
nuts and moisten with mayonnaise.
Put delicate crisp lettuce leaves on
chilled plates, heap a spoonful of the
mixture in the center of each nest of
leaves and garnish with unbroken
halves of walnuts and tiny stars cut
from rich golden orange peel.
BIRTHDAY PARTY (Busy Mother).
A dainty m*nu for the birthday party
supper m^y consist of clear clam broth,
served in cup?, accompanied by tiny
rolls, lamb chocs breaded, creamed
peas, sliced breast of chicken hot or
cold, tiny cucumber pickles and olives,
fruit salad served in orange baskets,
ire cream, cake, bon bons and coooa.
The table linen, china and silver should,
of course, be In perfect order, and the
floral decorations in the favorite color
of the little maid. Either carnations
or roses and ferns, arranged in a low
crystal bow!, wiil make a charming
center piece. As a cheaper adornment,
and one quite as attractive. I sugest a
pot of the lovely Chinese primrose,
ruse and white in color, in full bloom,
nestled among a lot cf filmy ferns. Ar
ranged in a low wicker basket this
would be lovely and really be more ap
propriate for a child's party than thÂ«
carnations or roses. Strands of ros?
rolorcd ribbon radiating from thÂ« cen
ter of- the table forming z whe?I ef
fect and silt cand:estic-k3 with ross
colored silk or paper shades will afford
an abundance of color to relieve the
white and gold china. A clever
scheme, to relieve any embarrassment
the little guests may feel between
courses and to encourage a Joyous
ppirit. is managed thus. A small card
upon which is written or neatly paste!
a witty little story told in a. very fev.
words, or a conundrum. Is folded in
each napkin. Each child Is asked to
read aloud his or her card for tha
amusement of all and the idea will hi
much enjoyed.
' ~J LABORATE. made to orflfr
â¢J trousseaux are going out of
J [ fashion, and the good old Ger- .
V. man custom of using the dower
chest is fast coming in. In New Eng
land the dower chest has long been a
concrete expression of a prettv senti
ment, but it is only recently that the
idea has spread over the whole coun
try.
This revival has inaugurated a new
feminine typeâ the charming Dower
Chest Girl. Unlike her German cousin,
the does not exist solely for marriage
âeven bachelor girls have the fad â
but. nevertheless, Ehe tucks a hope
down snugly in her heart that some
tirr.e she will meet her Prince Charm
in?.
Fortunate is she if her mother has
instilled into her a sentiment to put
much value on association Instead of
ever looking for the new. If eo, she
will take to her future home & store
cf things, every one cf which will be
dear because cf some sentiment con
nected with a sr^eciai event of her life.
It win, theiefore. be an ever recurring
pleasure to use or handle them In her
married life.
The dower chest girl, as an Amer
ican type, is distinctive. As a rule, ehe
acquires her chest by purchase, rather
than by Inheritance, as does her Ger
man prototype, but she takes quite as
much pride in its possession as if it
were an heirloom. If she can afford
it, her chest will be cf mahogany or
IMPROVING LARGE KNUCKLES.
â (Mabel). I know of nothing which
will reduce the size cf the knuckles.
With many people these abnormally
large knuckles is a matter of heredity;
in torn? cases they are the result of
outdoor sport3 or other exercises that
bring severe strains on the muscles of
the hands. Many people' ruin the
shape of their handte unconsciously by
sleeping with them under their head.
If you have acquired the habit of
thrusting your hand under your cheek
at night obtain a pillow a trifle smaller
than the one to which you are accus
tomed or use a small pad to thrust
u..der the side of the face while sleep
ing. This will assist in breaking up
the bad habit and after awhile you will
be able to discard the go-between. If
this plan does not suffice dab a little
strong perfume on the h^nd3 before
retiring and if the hands are brought
close to the fa'ce the strong odor is apt
to awaken the sleeper enough so that
the position will be changed. After
having discovered r.r.d removed the
cause of the enlarged knuckles it may
be possible to effect an improvement
for. the red. swollen appearance can
be greatly reduced by gentle massags
and the application of a whitening lo
tion. (See reply to Brownle.> Avoid
anything which tend3 to strain or
harden the muscles of the hands and
do not expect a decided improvement
in a few weeks or you will be disap
pointed; patience and perseverance are
required and I am confident if you fol
low the treatment suggested you will
be rewarded for the exertion in hands
of better sha^e and color.
A "WHITENING LOTION" (Brownie).
âIt is unfortunate that your skin Is
so dark that it does not seem to har
monize with your blue eyes, but I think
it can be Improved by persistent care
and the application of a whitening lo
tion. You may indulge freely in the
use of fruits, either raw or cooked, and
In vegetables, but abstain from the use
of strong coffee, sweets, pastry and
rich salads. Ask your physician to
prescribe a course cf treatment which
will act especially on the liver and
bowels and continue the warm and
cold snonge bath.3 to which you are
accustomed. Have the following lotion,
which is whitening as well as a good
tonic, prepared at any good druggist's:
Four ounces of violet cologne, one
ounce simple tincture of benzoin and
two ounces tincture of camphor. After
the bath/ berth morning and night,
bathe the arms, neck and face freely
vith the lotion. It will whiten and
tone up the skin wonderfully.
No. I do not think face powders
harmful if the best are bought and
they are properly used, as a mere fin
ish to a dainty toilet. It is a duty
every v/oman owes to herself to look as
pretty as possible at a!l rimes and. it
must be acknowledged, a little pow
tler works wonders in improving the
complexion. Discard the pink an<l
'.vhitc face powders you are now using:
they only exaggerate ihe color of your
skin and are too noticeable for a re
fined toilet. As a substitute us" a deep
cream face powder of a reliable make.
asking for the shade manufactured es
pecially for brunettes. This will blend
softly with the flesh tints and can
scarcely be perceived if judiciously ap
plied.
thin material plalrifand gored is sure
to look skimped and be & failure in its
peculiar way. A little thought In this
matter will save a good many dollars
and much annoyance. Silk drop lin
ings should be made entirely separate
from the # dress skirt, but both may be
joined in the same belt. I do not think
a habit-back skirt advisable for ' a
woman with large hips, for the skirt is
apt to ride op in front whenever the
wearer sits, roakir.sr it awkwardly short

length may be when ' standing, even
though fitted with the utmost care.
three or three and a. half yards in
length, for you may need it on state
occasions. Two dozen towels will
suffice and one doz;n tea towels will
keep you going. Sheets , are a con
sideration and I would try to get at
least eight, for in case of illness they
are a positive necessity. One dozen
slips should serve, and your troubles
should be at an Â«nd. Of course, there
are endless small articles that are nice
and decidedly convenient, but if you
find that your money is holding out
better than you thought It would it is
very easy to get them. A good way
would be to make out a list and allow
yourself so much for each article, and
if you search diligently you can just
about make both end3 meet every
time.

why he couldn't get home , from the office in time to
put on decent clothes and make himself look as though
he was a member of a respectable family. That t was
what George got for tending to busincss*;iiid keeping
out of tlie black sheep class. All the young 'ladies
he Was .the sheerest cumbprcr of the ground. Their
parents were always telling people how bright a fellow
John Henry was and how cute he had looked in kilts
when he was four years old; if the visitor didn't be
lieve it they would drag down the chamber of l>orrorj
from the marble-topped center table in the parlor and
produce- the documentary evidence. If any one sug
gested that George was a fair sort of a chap George's
mother would shrug her shoulders and. grudgingly ad
mit that he hadn't been in jailâ yet. Then she would
launch out in a long panegyric of John Henry tending
to prove that he was one of the original wonders of the
world, although he wasn't doing"* business at that par
ticular moment.
Whenever they had company at dinner John Henry
would come down dressed like the lilies of the field
only warmer â while George would probably dash in at
thh last minute with his hair standing on end and ink
marks all over his collar. Then Johiv Henry would get
the glad hand all round while George would be asked
cate the awful curse of gamblingâ by breaking the bank
six nights in succession. It was > matter of history that
he had beÂ«:n seen in church at least once in the course
of his life, but it was alleged by competent witnesses
that that was when he was christened, a..d as he hadn't
been consulted about that it should not be laid up
against him. John Henry was very fond of his home,
and to prove it he took good care not to wear out the
carpet in the front hall by walking over it any more
than was absolutely necessary, or to appear at break
fast with the rest of the family often enough to become
commonplace.
It would naturally be assumed by those unversed in
the ways of the world toward black sheep in : general
that John, Henry would be very unpopular and that the
family would play George for favorite on = every occa
sion. This was so far from being the :case > . however,*
that it might have been guessed by the' same unversed
individuals that it was George and not John Henry, who
scratched all the paint off the front door and tried to
take the banisters upstairs with him â¢when- he came in
after the closing hour. - â¢ Â¦ . Â¦
George did more good to. the .world in five minutes
than John Henry did in a month, but the. action 'of the
world "in question would have led one to believe that
WOHN HENRY was a black sheep, while his brother
I George was the other kind. At this point let us
f%\ pause for a moment, or possibly two, to reflect on
the remarkable fact in human psycho-physiology, if
any one present knows what that means, that black
sheep arc almost always less sheepish than their white
brethren. Cut to proceed, if we can get the right of
way. John lienry devoted most of his waking hours to
putting in an extra large crop of wild oats, while his
brother was attending strictly to business and gradually
working up to the point where he would be known as
the teacher of the largest Sunday-school class in town
and so admirable a young man that he wouldn't be able
to get any one except the minister and the president of
the VYo;nan'Â» Aid Society to talk to him for more tlvan
ten minutes at a stretch, r
The .theory upon which John lienry regulated his ac
tions was that life is necessarily more or less limited
in its scope and that when we are through with it we
arc likely to be unoccupied for a considerable time.
Furthermore, he reflected, the money that we leave be
hind us doesn't <3q us any sort of good and is likely to
be the source of no end of trouble to our heirs. George,
on the other hand, was everything that a really good
young man should be, except popular. He was slowly
but surely building up a balance in the bank that would
enable him to purchase at least an umbrella and a rain
coat wT.cn the inevitable rainy d2y should blow in. He
worked from nine to five six days in the week and then
carefully cleaned off his desk and walked home to get
jhc air. In the evening he played checkers' with Â¦ his
father or steered his mother and sister around the cor
ner to a paic tea zX the rectory in aid of the crippled
children oi Da;iiur.-knd. He was the sort of chap who
always v.ears rubbers when it rains and never goes out
i:i cold weather without an overcoat and a pair of van:
jrlovca. His idea of a wild time was to put on a black
cutaway :i;;d a v.hite tic -and play charades and ask
ridclci from eight to ten, with an intermission for cof
fee -nil sslad snndv.iches.
It would be impossible to describe John Henry's idea
of a good time without using asbestos paper. His even
ing was ju;t beginning, as a rule, when George was lay
ing i,:m down upon his virtuous couch, and it lasted un
til the waiters began to put the chairs on the tables and
turn the lights out. He never drankâ more than there
was in the houseâ and his highest ambition was to eradi-
thought George was a very nice fellow,, but any one
skilled in the ways of the sex might have detected that
the said young ladies never spent any time talking with
George when John Henry was on the horizon. The rea
son that they gave for this peculiar behavior was that
they thought they might be able' to reform the latter
and turn him from his ways of sin. /
Of course it often happened that John Henry got into
debt and, equally of course, on each such occasion his
father came to the front like a little man and threw him
a life preserver that enabled him to make # his way baclc
to the terra firma of unimpaired credit again. When he
landed in the police station for running off with another
man's automobile in an' excess of bibulous emotion the
whole community shook its head gently and murmured
that boys must be "boys, even at other people's expense.
This feat only made the young ladies more anxious than
ever to draw him out of the highway of sin and back
to the narrow path of strict rectitude.
By. and by, or perhaps a little later, it happened that
George got his eye on a particular young lady whom he
thought might be induced to;sjt-in the shade of his vine
and fig tree if he could, guarantee the right kind of a
tree. Affairs seemed promisjgg and George had made
a date with himself when, he intended to ask the young
lady the important question/ 'if, it wasn't raining too
hard for him to go out. Just then John Flenry sailed
into the game and carried the girl off in a single sitting.
He was introduced to her one evening, proposed the
next and was married to her a week later.
Of course John Henry hasn't reformed.. If he did
people would lose interest in him and his wife would
have "no more occasion to be good to Aim for the
sake Jbi wooing him from the ways of sin. When his
father died he left the big end of his bank account* to
John Henry because George would always be able to
take care of himself, thus proving that whatever
heaven may do for men who help themselves, the earth
is much more careful of the other kind. George has
never married because he has never been able to con
vince any woman that a man who always knows where
his umbrella is and saves half of his salary right along
needs a wife around to tell him what he ought to do.
To make a long, sad story as short : ; possible, this
little tragedy of real life demonstrates to the entire
satisfaction of all reasonably intelligent people that
while we must all undoubtedly reap wha" we have sown,
the man who sows wild oats is likely to have a lot more
people to help him when it comes time to gather in the
sheaves.

Anybody can have the ball; he has
had his game and is happy. They talk
of introducing cricket into Belgium. I
shall 'certaintly try to be present at
the opening game. I am afraid that
until he learns from experience, the
Belgian fielder, will stop cricket balls
with his head. That the head is the
proper thing with which to play ball
appears to be in his blood; my head is
round, he argues, and hard, Just like
the ball itself; what part of a man
more fit and proper to meet and stop a
ball, except, perhapsâ but no, the head
comes more readily. Golf has not yet
caught on, but tennis is firmly estab
lished from St. Petersburg to Bor
deaux. The German, with the thor
oughness characteristic of him, is
working hard. University professors,
stout majors, rising early In the morn-
w-ere daring tobogganists; the undu
lating common makes them sad because
they can no longer handle a golf club;
by the riverside they eit down and tell
you of the salmon they caught before
they caught rheumatic fever; birds only
make them long for guns; music raises
visions of the local cricket match of
long ago enlivened by the local band;
a picturesque estaminet with little ta
bles spread out under the vines recalls
bitter memories of ping-pong. One is
sorry for them, but their conversation
is not exhilarating. The man who has
other interests In life beyond sport is
apt to find their reminiscences monot
onous; while to each other they do not
care to talk; one gathers that they do
not altogether believe one another. The
foreigner is taking kindly to our sports;
one hopes he will be forewarned by our
example and not overdo the thing. At
present one is bound to admit he shows
no sign of taking sport too seriously.
Football is gaining favor more and
more throughout Europe. Buf yet the
Frenchman has not got it out of his
head that the coup to practice is kick
ing the ball high into the air and catch
ing it upon his head. He would father
catch the ball upon his head than score
a goal. If he can maneuver the ball
away into a corner, kick it up into the
air twice running, and each time catch
it on his head, he does not seem to care
ing, hire boys ana practice back hand
ers and half volleys. But to the French
man,' as yet, it still remains a game.
He plays It in a happy, merry fashion,
that Is shocking to English eyes. Your
partner's service rather astonishes you.
An occasional yard or so beyond the
line happens to any. one, but this man's
object appears to be to break windows.
You feel you really must remonstrate
when the Joyous laughter and tumultu
ous applause of the spectators explains
the puzzle to you. He has not been
trying to serve, he has been trying to
hit a man in the next court who is
stooping down to tie up his shoelace.
With his last ball he has succeeded; he
has hit the man in the small of the

unanimous opinion of the surrounding
critics is that the ball could not possi
bly have been better placed. A Doherty

followed by whooping claimants. In the
course of half an hour or so, when
everybody is dead beat, the gameâ the
original game â is resumed. You de
mand the score; your partner promptly
says it is forty-fifteen. Both your op
ponents rush up to the set and appar
ently there is going to be a duel. It
is only a friendly altercation; they very
much doubt its being forty-flf teen. Flf
teeh-forty they could believe; they sug
gest it as a compromise; the discussion
Is concluded by calling it deuce. As it
is rare for a game to proceed without
some such Incident, occurring in the
middle of it, the score generally is
deuce. This avoids heartburning; no
body wins a set and nobody loses. The
one game generally suffices for the
afternoon. To the earnest player it is
also confusing to occasionally miss your
partnerâ to turn around and find he is
talking to a man. Nobody but yourself
takes the slightest objection of his ab
sence. The other side appears to regard
it as a good opportunity to score. Five
minutes later he resumes the game.
His friend comes. with him, also the
dog of his friend. The dog is welcomed
with enthusiasm: all balls are return
ed to the dog. Until the dog Is tired
you do not get a look In. But all this
will no doubt soon be changed. ' There

the crowd. Even the man who has been
hit appears pleased; it shows what *â¢
Frenchman can do when he does take
up a game. But French honor demands
revenge.
He forgets his shoe, he forgets his
game. He gathers together all the balls
that happen .to be handy. And then'
commences the return match. At this
point it is best to crouch down under
shelter of the net. Most of the players
round about adopt this plan; the more'
timid make for the clubhouse, and, flnd-
ing themselves there, order coffee and
light up cigarettes. After a while play
ers appear to be satisfied. The other
players then gather round to claim .
their balls. This makes a good game
by itself. The object is to get as many
balls as. you can, your own, and other

it naturally attracts one. Anyhow the
fact remains that -most tannfs : . players
on the Continent, whether English or
foreign, have a tendency to aim the
ball direct at heaven. At- an English
club in Switzerland there existed in my
day a young Englishman who was real
ly a wonderful player. To get the ball
past .him was almost an impossibility.

hundred feet or so into the air and de

pleading to be given an umpire. Every
umpire had fled. They hid behind trees,
borrowed silk hats *and umbrellas and
pretended they were visitors â any de
vice, hdwever mean, to avoid the task
of umpiring for that young man. Pro
vided his opponent did not go to sleep
or get cramp, one game might last all
day. .-"-*%
Any one could return his ball3; but,
as I have said, to get a ball past him
was almost an Impossibility. He in
variably won. The other man, after an
hour or so, would get mad and try to
lose. It was his only chance of dinner.
It is a pretty sight generally speaking,
a tennis ground abroad. The women
pay more attention to their costumes
than do our lady player3; the men are
usually In spotless white. The ground
is often charmingly situated, the club
house picturesque; there is always
laughter and merriment. The play may
not be so good to watch, but the pic
ture is delightful. I accompanied a
man a little while ago to his club on
the outskirts of Brussels. The ground
was bordered by a wood on one slda
and surrounded on the other three by
petites fermesâ allotments, as we
should call-them in England, worked
by the peasants themselves. It was a
glorious spring afternoon. The courts
were crowded. The red earth and the
green grass formed . & background
against which the women In their new
Parisian toilets, under their bright par
asols, stood out like wondrous bouquets
of moving flowers. The whole atmos
phere was a delightful mingling of Idle
gayety, flirtation and graceful sen
suousness. A modern Watteau would
have seized upon the scene with avidity.
Just beyondâ separated by the al
most invisible wire fencingâ a group of
peasants were working in their field.
An old woman and a young girl, with
ropes about their shoulders, were draw
ing a harrow guided by a withered old
scarecrow of a man. They paused for,
a moment at the wire fencing and look
ed through. It was an odd contrast;
the two worlds divided ! by that wire
fencingâ so slight, almost invisible. The
girl swept the sweat from her face
with her hand; the woman pushed back
her gray locks underneath the hand
kerchiefs knotted about her head, the
old man straightened himself with
some difficulty. So they stood, for per
haps a minute, gazing with quiet, pas
sionless faces through that slight fenc
ing, that a push from their work-hard
ened hands might have leveled. Was
there any thought, I wonder, passing
through their brains? The younc girl?
âshe was a handsome creature In spite
of her disfiguring garments. The
woman?â it was a wonderfully fine
face, clear, calm eyes, deep set under
a square, broad- brow. The "withered
old scarecrow?â ever sowing the seed
in the spring of the fruit that others
shall eat. The old man bent again over
the guiding ropes; gave a word. The
team moved forward up the hllL ' It Is

THAT we English attach too much
importance to eport goes without
sayingâ or. rather, it has been
said so often as to have become
a commonplace. Jnc of these days
some reforming EngliEh novelist will
write a book, showing the evil effects of
overindulgence in sport; the neglected
business, the ruined home, the slow but
sure sapping of the brain â what there
may have been of it in the beginning;
l<>adins to semi-imbecility arid yearly
increasing obesity. A young couple I
once heard of went for their honeymoon
to Scotland. The poor girl did not know
he was a golfer (he had wooed and won
her during a period of idleness, enforced,
by* a sprained rhoulder), or maybe she
would have avoided Scotland. The idea
they started with was that of a tour.
The second day the roan went out for
a Etro!l by himself. At dinner time he
observed, with a far away look in his
eyes, that it seemed a pretty spot they'
had struck, and suggested their staying
there another day. The next morning
after breakfast he borrowed a club
from the hotel porter and remarked he
would take a walk while she finished
doing her hair. He said it amused him,
swinging a golf club while she walked.
He returned in time for lunch and
seemed moody all the afternoon; he
said the a;z- suited him, and urged that
they should linger yet another day. She
was young and inexperienced and
thought rr.aybe it was his liver. She had
heard much about liver from her
father. The next morning he borrowed
more clubs and went out. this time,
before breakfast, returning to a late
and not over sociable dinner. That was
the end of their honeymoon, so far as
she was concerned. HÂ« meant well,
but the. thing had gone too far. The
vice had entered into his blood, and the
smell of the links drove out all other
considerations.
We are most of us familiar, I take it,
with the story of the golfing person who
could not help from swearing when
balls went wrong. "Golf and the min
istry don't seem to go together," his
friend told him; "take my advice be
fore it's too late and give it up, Tamus."
A few months later Tamus met his
friend again. "Ye were right, Jamie,"
cried the person, cheerfully, "they
dinna run well in harness; golf and
the rneenistry. I hae followed your ad
vice, I hae given it oop." "Then what
are ye doing with the sack of clubs?"
inquired Jimmy. "What am I doing
with them?" repeated the puzzled Ta
mus, "why I'm going to play golf with
them." A light broke upon him.
"Great Heavens, man!" he continued.
"ye didna' think t'was the golf I'd
gi'en up!" The Englishman does not
understand play; he makes a lifelong
labor of his sport, and to it sacrifices
mind and body. The health resorts of
Europe â to paraphrase a famous say
ing that nobody appears to have said â
draw half their profits from the play-

like to undertake the care and training
of from forty' to sixty belonging to
some . other- people who 'don't, care
enough about their children to ask who
their teacher is? When finding fault
with a teacher, do you ever stop to
think that. at least ninety-nine out of
every hundred teachers are better pre
pared for, the training of .children than
are most 'parents? They have spent
years striving to learn how best to edu
cate these precious children. How much
time doos ' the average parent give to
this subject? Is it not â¢' just possible
that they know more about their work
than do most parents? Would it not,
therefore, be best for parents to try to
co-operate' with the teachers.'
Have you ever really tried to learn
how you can help the teacher "so that
she might accomplish more for. your
own dear child and those of others?
Do you ever believe what your child
says Â¦without' hearing the other side of
the complaint? Should not parents and
teachers work together? If they pull
in ' opposite directions,:. will not the in
terest - of the ; child remain stationary?
Before criticizing, will you not stop and
The teacher's moral influence is by.
far her most important influence. What
have you done to make certain that it
is what it should be? How often have
you visited the teacher, unless to tell
her how much you don't think of her,
or to make some complaint? If you
have found a worthy teacher and are
pleased with, your child's progress,
what- have you done to encourage her?
How often have you told the principal
or a member of the Board of Education
what good work she is doing, and what
an, outrage you think it is to pay so
of children? Tet how common it is.
So common, indeed, that it has become
a proverb that "One parent will sup
port ten children better than ten chil
dren will support one parent." It is
a shame. It is the fault of their train
ing. It is our fault.
The lack of interest shown by many
parents In their children's school is
one of the wonders of the present day.
Many seem to think that the school
life consists entirely of recitations, and
that it is merely for this purpose .that
children go to school. This is a very
small and the least important part of
their training. If it were the most im
portant part, parents might be ex
cused for their lack of interest. There
might then be some excuse for not pay
ing the poor teacher such a salary as
would enable her to live as she should
and improve herself as she would.
is the case, .with little consideration.
The important thing Is to have the
right ideal.
We must not expect that each ehild
will be able to reach the high ideal we
have in mind. But this is no reason
why we should work patiently and
persistently to secure the Best possible
results. What parent, looking Into the
face of the blue-eyed girl or the brown
eyed boy, can tell what strong passions
or what high moral qualities lie hidden
in that head or heart? There may be
the elements of the criminal, of the
orator, of the sta'-iman. No matter
what these tendencies 'are, they are
subject to modification and susceptible
to the Influences which the parents can
exert. Every normal child is capable
of â¢ endless improvemtnt through, the
long years, of life.
No parent can easily manage a child
until he has made a very careful exam
ination of himself. Each one of us has
a f number of peculiarities which are
likely to reappear in our children, who
have learned or inherited them from
us; and they are also likely to deter
mine our 'methods of managing others.
We must not forget that "like pro
duces like." Lore awakens. love. Harsh
ness excites harshness; anger, anger;
frankness, frankness. This seemingly
important fact is of th^greatesf*valu<Â»
in enabling us to. properly train, our
children. We must ever remember that
the surest and best way to produce
emotions or thoughts in our children
is to show these qualities in ourselves.
This is one of the great secrets of suc
cess In the management of children..
Have you ever crlftcized the teacher
in the presence of your. child? .If you
do, are you aware of the fact that you
are injuring your child . a . hundred
times as much as you are injuring the
.teacher? When he finds he can depend
- upon you he will say the teacher has
a "pick at him." . It is Â¦ quite natural
that you should believe, his story. But
should you not investigate before-let
ting. him . have his . own ..way about
leaving school? On your way down the
street, watch for other boys whose par
ents believed that they were "picked
at." You can see him on every corner.
A cigar in his mouth, impudence in his
face, a swagger in" his walk, and don't
care-a-cent in -his manner. He 'thinks
he is older, than his parents, knows
more than all' his teachers, . and is
probably running * a â¢ | downward ' course
faster than the latest automobile. Might
4tnot be well to consider h6w you can
help the teacher manage and, train your
child? Is it not best to take for granted
that the teacher is right, unless you arc
led to the opposite conclusion : after
careful investigation? Do- you really.
remember that the teacher's work is
very difficult at beat?. It" Is probable
that your child's* teacher Is making
the work more interesting and profit
able than "any. teacher to J whom you
have ever gone; for the schools of to
day are infinitely better than they
were twenty-five years ago.
want to help .. the teacher and your
children? See that they are neat and
clean, that they attend school regu
larly and promptly, that they under
stand that you expect them to obey
their teachers; that they work indus
triously while In school. Will you do
this?- If you will, you and your chil
dren will never regret your having
done so. 1-." ~-~ â¢
There, are times when It seems best
to send boys and girls to boarding
schools. Generally it is a mistake.
Better keep them under your own eye.
If -you must send them to boarding
school, select the school with great
care. Like a poor teacher, a poor
school is dear at any price. Don't be
in a hurry about having your children
take advanced subjects and other lan
guages. * It is more important that
they learn to observe, to think and
compare, and that they understand
and have something to say in English
rather than know many languages and
have nothing-, to say in any of them.
- Every thoughtful parent is anxious
to properly train his child. Proper
training will differ with each child. The
effort should be to develop the" natural
capacities of the child so that it may
unfold to a strong, beautiful character.
This will mean strength of body, vigor
ous energy, warm affections, natural
appetites, Â¦'. proper ambitions, refined
tastes, firm moral convictions and a
strong desire to do what is right!
It is well for parents to have an ideal
in mind while training children. How
ever, this should be determined upon
after careful thought and not, as often
children of the same age are in other
families. This is entirely a matter of
training. Children naturally love to do
things themselves. We all know chil
dren four or five years old who are able
to help . themselves as well as many
children much older. In helping them-
Felves we should let them make reaÂ»
sonable effort, but stand ready to give
assistance at the proper time. If a
child wishes to do what the parent
thinks should not be done, lest it suf
fer pain, it is often best to warn the
child. Then, if it suffers because of
not following the suggestion of the
parent, the child learns the evil effects
of disobedience. The great majority
of parents will express sympathy, and
will not say, "it serves you right." The
parent who answers in such a way may
be certain that the child's confidence
will not soon be won.
Considerable effort should be made to
teach children to be grateful for- the
many blessings which most do not ap
preciate. We, ourselves, are not gen
erally grateful save for that which is
unexpected. Much less are our chil
dren likely to be. They are apt to take
everything as if it rightly belonged to
them. Too few children in these days
have any idea of what they owe their
parents. Is this not largely the result
of our training? The parent who has
shown children reasons for being grate
ful will have children who will
appreciate what is done for them.
This will make out of home a comfort
able, happy place for the parents.
What thrust will sink deeper into the
soul of a parent than the ingratitude'

The family where all children are
boys or girls is not complete. There is
something lacking. . Xo â¢ matter how

Without boys, there will be lacking the
manly, strengthening influences. With

sweetness â¢ and tenderness. But are
there .not many homes where there

From one of the " Russians it was
learned that there is a regular trade4n
human smuggling on the frontier lines
of Russia and that for the sum of $15
foreign agents undertake to bring these
runaways across, providing them with
clothes in exchange, for the Russian
uniforms, and keeping them out of the

they are able to get a safe distance

PARIS, June 25. â Louise Michel,
much broken In appearance from the
severe strain from a recent illness, re
cently gave in the Hotel des Socletes
Savantes in Paris a lecture in which
she described her feelings when she
believed herself to be dying. â¢
"My will was absolutely gone," she
said. "I observed â¢ myself as dispas
sionately as though I were another
b^ing. All material things became
vague. But my impressions became
powerfully acute â my senses became
externalized, as it were. I recollected a
similar experience I had in New Cale

were black, the sea, was black, and it
seemed to me that from the depths of

LOUISE MICHEL EXPLAINS
SENSATION OF DYING
Of his future plans nothing certain is
known. He would like to win the Prix
de Rome; but for that he must become
a naturalized Frenchman, and then. the
dreadful military service (doubly
dreadful to an artistic nature such as
his) would have to follow. Perhaps
when they have once known America
the Stykas will learn to love it and
make it their future home.
At the St. Louis Exposition, in a spe
cial building, Jan Styka will exhibit his
"Quo Vadis" series, together with his
"Golgotha." Tada Styka will be repre
sented by five pictures there, his "Tol
stoi" portrait and four others. . '.
easels and is posed, the son making
suggestions to the father, and the
father generally, carrying them out.
Jan Styka works very rapidly with
powerful brush In long, unwavering
strokes. Tada is more timid, seeking
his medium, choosing between the
many possibilities his vision sees. The
father has gained his effect, broad, ex
perienced, floridj $l?e boy refines, ideal
izing, dreaming with" nervous touch.
And the model sees her dual personal
ity emerging from the two canvases;
and the father's picture flatters her so
that she smiles, but the son's leaves her
pensive.
Father and son live alone together in
their studio of the Place Pigalle, Bohe
mian both. There is ho show of au
thority on the father's side. Tada is
"serious," and needs no guiding hand.
So they work together, and for recrea
tion roam out to see the galleries, the
Luxembourg or Louvre.
It is wonderfully^ interesting to see
them paint simultaneously from the
same model. She sits before their two
He has had his romping, of course,
and recalls with pleasure his bicycling
escapades with Jean de Reszke's son
last summer at St. Jean de Luz. He
rides a horse and enjoys it, and in the
studio can be seen an elastic home ex
erciser, to make him strong, says his
father, since health and strength are
the handmaidens of successful art. But
the truth is, he exists only for , his
work. "Taciturn and solitary," they
termed him at the Jesuits': but it was
no such thing. No morbid limitation,
only an absolute self-devotion.
IS FATHER'S COMPANION/
It can easily be imagined that Tada
Styka does not present many points of
resemblance with other boys of his
age. Small, even for his years (espe
cially in comparison with his father, a
broad-shouldered giant), thin and pal
lid, with the eyes that grasp the vision
of truth and beauty and the mobile
mouth that speaks of limitless poten
tial emotion, he is bright and cheery
when roused, but loves rather to rest In
repose, and is timid because sensitive,
silent because absorbed.
'The boy next did his portrait of
Tolstoi, which was hung in the Paris
salon of last year and created no lit
tle sensation. But he still worked on,
never taking lessons, never having
taken lessons, offering, on the con
trary, advice to his father which
might easily have emanated from a
veteran in the art. Heller, their next
door neighbor, "came in occasionally
and gave him valuable hints, but there
were never any lessons or semblance
of them, for the reason (it is Jan Styka
again who speaks) that this boy of 13
had already acquired his art by natural
gift.
. He has just sent in two canvases to
the salon, which were instantly ac
ceptedâa portrait of his father and,
strange and difficult introspection, a
portrait of himself. In the studio,
among other works, there hang two
studies of "Ecce Homo" and a study
of the "Flight of Icarus," not yet fin
ished. There are, too, : innumerable
drawings, as well as several works of
sculpture, including one of a long
haired greyhound, which is wonderful
ly clever. This last manifestation of
his genius is perhaps the most strik
ing of all. The father is not a sculptor,
and bo could not have taught Tada had
he wished. The boy somehow grot hold
of a handful of clay, and when the
dog, a stray pet of the studio, strolled
in, modeled him then and there.
He is also copying Holbein at the
Louvre. A special authorization had
to be obtained for him from the Min
ister of Fine Arts, it not being tht
custom, protested the administration,
to admit children of such tender years.
Another canvas that well Illustrates
the trend of his talent is a Hungarian
battle scene. His father is working
upon a composition, "Bern and Patofl,"
the heroesb of the Hungarian war ol
independence. Tada saw it and de
picted It, tooâ not in servile imitation,
but as his own, independent vision
saw it. the grouping, coloring and gen
eral plan entirely distinct. "For," he
said naively, "I also would like to be a
Meissonier." - : ; "..; \M

born at Lemberg (Poland), and, left
an orphan at an early age, was soon
studying art and earning his living at
it meanwhile In Vienna and Rome.
He returned home in 1890 and there
painted his magnificent composition
of "Polonia" â his motherland per
sonified by a tortured woman, around
her the great ones among her children
protesting in the face of heaven. This
excited such admiration that a public
subscription was set on foot to pur
chase it and it now hangs in the place
of honor in the Town Hall of Styka's
native city of Lemberg. Any repro
duction of the painting Is forbidden In
Itussia. A friend of the artist at War
saw was discovered with a print of it
in his possession and is still In prison,
jvrhaps in Siberia, for this dire of
fense.
Jan Styka next accepted a commis
sion from Paderewski tÂ© paint the
Crucifixion and spent the entire year
of 1894 in the Holy Land. The result
"was his "Golgotha, the Place of
Skulls."' -which was first shown in
Paderewski's palace at Warsaw, but is
now on its way to St. Louis. He was
also the painter of that huge pano
rama of "Nero's Circus," which was
one of the features of the Paris Ex
position of 1900.
The work, however, which has estab
lished his international reputation
must be held to be the pictures to
Â¦Quo Vadis." In a series of fifteen
frigantic canvases he has portrayed
the principal scenes of that famous
book with an accuracy, a detail* and
an emotional effect that none but a
penius could attain to.
SOX'S GEXTUS BORN'.
It was during the progress of these
"Quo Vadis" pictures that his son, lit
tle Tada, manifested his talent and fin
ished by convincing his father of it,
sternest and most exacting critic of
them all. M. Styka has five sons. The
other four played with their toys or
indulged in rough and tumble, but
Tada, the eldest, remained In his
father's Etudio, looking with wonder
ing, reflective eyes at the work going
on around him. Then he would pick
up a pencil lying near and without a
word begin to sketch the objects that
caught his notice. Still life, or parts
of his father's paintings, but prin
cipally, first of all, animals, commenc
ing with the domestic cat lying sleep
ing upon a cushion.
The father at first paid no heed,
busy In his own work, and thinking
nothing of these boyish fancies; but
his friends and visitors began to ques
tion and to prophesy. For the boy
was trying now with palette and with
clayâ dogs, horses and other animals
still holding his preference as models.
Then he and his father came tp Paris,
the rest of the family remaining in
Poland. Jan Styka had grown used to
his son's companionship, grown used
to his presence in his studio, and so
brought him with him.
In Paris the reproach was made to
Styka that the boy's education was
being neglected, so the father, as he
thought in duty bound, as much
against his own will as his son's, sent
him to the Jesuit Fathers in the Rue
<3e Vaugirard. It is to be feared that
in science and mathematics Tada was
. onsidered inattentive, but he brought
back the gold medal for drawing.
Another development followed. One
day the boy brought to his father a
life-cire canvas depicting his concep
tion of Silenus. the rubicund Baccha
nalian, with the vine leaves in his hair.
It was impossible to dispute further.
The boy at 11 years of age had de
clared himself a born painter.
Tot even then the father was not
quite sure. They were living in that
i*reat block of btudios on the Place
Pigaile. wliieh Puvis de Chavannes and
so many others have rendered illustri
ous. Holler and Gerome were living
next door, and Styka went to see them.
and ask them to judge the work. The
reply was decisive. The Jesuit fathers
saw Tada Styka no more. He came to
live with his fatherâ two comrades (It
is his father's own expression) work
ins together in their art
1 henceforward they abided together,
fellow artists sharing one Etudio. but
certainly equals. It was with the "Quo
VadjB" pictures that they inaugurated
Iheir partnership, for the boy is re
sponsible for no inconsiderable part of
them. All the animals are hisâ the

LONDON, June 16.â What might be
called the "eannlness" of the Duke and
Duchess of Roxburghe has of late been
making a profound Impression on vari-
The promised arrival of the artist
Jan van Beers from Paris comes as
most welcome news tÂ» many of the
beautiful American society women in
London, who have hopes of persuading
the master to let them give him sittings
for a portrait. For all this artist's
most notable successes have been with
the portraits of the fair ones from the
United States. His great patron In
England is Lily, Dowager Duchess of
Marlborougb, and it was as a mark of
gratitude to her and her husband that
Jan van Beers gave the famous supper
a few years ago at the Continental Gal
lery, when the late Duke of Marlbor
ough was the guest of honor and John
Alrd.-the great engineer of Nile fame,
was also a special guest. The table
around which the guests sat was oC
crystal, lit up from beneath by electric
lights. The menu was no less than a
foot long and the dinner Itself one
series of surprises. A pie was brought
in and placed before Jan van Beers,
and when this was cut out came a
flight of Java sparrows. Magic lantern
views were thrown upon the ceilinp:.
and for the entertainment of the guests,
artists so varied in methods as Melba
and Florence St. John, the musical
comedy favorite, warbled from behind
a screen. One point always to be re
membered was the profusely befrilled
shirt worn on this occasion by Jan van
Beersâ who was the host of some forty*
to fifty men. leading representatives of
all the arts and professions.
The. protege of the Americans in
London and on the" Continent comes to
England, however, not in his capacity
as a great portrait painter; but. on the
contrary, to hold an exhibition of hid
landscape work at the Dowdeswell
Galleries, for he is most anxious to
prove that the man who is a portrait
painter can also be a landscapist.
If King Edward had his own way ha
would divide his time about equally
between sport and science. It is not
generally known that he is an enthu
siastic weather prophe* and when he
had the time he was a devoted student
of geology. Since he came to the throne
he has had each of the royal residences
fitted up with an observatory, and on
clear nights he occupies some hours on
the roofs studying and observing the
heavens. For a private observatory the>
one at Frogmore is one of the most
scientifically equipped In Europe. When
his Majesty is not in residence there,
he insists that a copy of the special
report of the observations be sent to
him each day, and these he carefully
compares with corresponding periods
during previous years. His medical ad
visers know that his meteorological en
thusiasm has cost him many a severe
cold.
The Hon. John Lee Carroll of Mary
land was, during his stay in England,
a constant visitor to the House of
Commons, where he evinced much in
terest In the debates. He appears to
have friends among all sections of poli
ticians. One evening he was the guest
of John Redmond, the leader of the
Irish party, the next day he was es
corted by Major Seeley, who is In re
volt against the Tories on the subjects
of Chinese labor in South Africa and
the fiscal policy of Joseph Chamberlain,
while later on In the evening he was
the guest of the Prime Minister at the
Carlton Club.
Coombe Abbey at Coventry, where
Lord and Lady Craven have hitherto
spent most of their time, will not be
entirely deserted. Mrs. Bradley-Martin
will be there or at her place in Scot
land, when she is not in London. It
Is not her intention to set up a Lon
don establishment for some time, and
when she has occasion to come to Lon
don she will stay at some of the fash
ionable family hotels. She is getting
tired of the increasing excitement of
the London season, and her intention
is to live more in the country in the
future. If she had her choice she
would prefer Lord Craven's other
place In Berkshire, but his Lordship's
connection with the Berkshire Yeo
manry makes it necessary for him to
reside there during a portion of th*
year. Coombe Abbey Is an expensive
place to maintain, and as it is the
intention of the Martins to live quietly
for some time it is not expected that
they will spend much of their time
there. The fact that the servants, ex
cept those who will be transferred to
Chesterfield House, are about to be dis
charged is taken as an indication that
Coombe Abbey will not see many so

Through .the generosity of hii
mother-in-law Lord Craven has after
some years of waiting become pos
sessed of a mansion in London. Mrs.
Bradley-Martin has presented her for
mer town house to her daughter, and
the present season will see the Coun
tess and her husband entertaining on
a liberal scale. Since their marriage
Lord and Lady Craven have been pre
cluded from taking much part in the
London season simply because they had
no town house. Her Ladyship is not
given to extravagance and could not
see the sense of paying the extortion
ate rents demanded in the West End.

the lodge was closed there was a march
to an adjoining hall, where a banquet
waÂ» iserved to more than one hundred.
At the head of the table sat two of

"Was this in your Bostonian days?" I
asked.
"Partly. I was first one year with '.
them, and then another two," the sing
er replied.
"Did you begin with them?" I asked.
"Dear, no," Miss Bertram replied. "I
began, if you please, with Herr Hein
rich Conried â came out here on my first
visit with him in 'The King's Fool.' "
"No, really?" I cried. "Tell me about
it. It was, of course, an operatic com
pany?"
"Yes," the singer said; "not very im
portant, not at all famous, pretty poor
financially. We had to wait not a few
times for pay day; we always got it,
though. But I think we did some pret
ty good work. Ah, if I had only done
as Mr. Conried advised!"
"Worked hard, I suppose?"
Miss Bertram nodded a wistful "yes"
and went on then to say: "Mr. Conried
taught me all I know, and If I'd done
as he told me I should have been â well,
not in vaudeville. He wanted me to
study for such parts as Fritzl Scheff
takes, andâ who knows?"'
"Who knows?" I echoed.
"Yes, I fcsed to walk for Mr. Con
ried two hours a dayâ"
"To walk?"
"Yes, like this," Miss Bertram laugh
ed, and she got up and ambled across
the room, even as you and I would
if we were told to trot for an audience.
It was very funny, not funnier, how
ever, than to see her lift her arm as
I suppose you and I would for critical
company.
"And Mr. Conried does not forget
his old friends," Mis3 Bertram went on
to testify. "He has time for every
body. I went In to see him not so
long ago, and, busy as he was, he
would hardly let me come away. I
must listen to Caruso on his phono
graph â "
"Oh, Conried, how could you!" V t
cried.
"It's not lad," the singer laughed,
"I knew the voice in a minute."
"Well, you were with the Bostonlans
after that?"
"With other things between."
"And It was while with them that
you did the chief role in Oscar Weil's
opera?"
" 'A War Time Wedding,' yes," Miss
Bertram said. "We did it first at the
Columbia. It's such a pretty opera.
Yo-u know it?"
"Better, I know its composer," I said.
Then I told Miss Bertram that Mr.
Weil had said very nice things of her
work in the opera, whereat she re
joiced greatly.
"If I had only worked!" she sighed
then. "But there. I've had so much
trouble. One can't," you know, play
seven times a week, rehearse, travel,
and. then study for bigger things and
be in an everlasting peck of trouble
at the same time."
"You look happy enough nowâ"
"I am," she said, and you would have
beli-jved her. "I was never so happy
in my life. You know â Mr. Morgan and
I liked each other for a long time be
foreâbut you don't want to know
that."
"Don't I!"
Then she told me she had been a
widow for five years before she had
married Mr. Morganâ nine months ago
âand several other interesting things
not for publication, ending up by ask
ing: "Are you married?"
"Noâ"
"You should be," she decided; "it's
the only way to live."

it." . â¢

Am I betraying confidence in saying
why the vaudeville conditions appeal?
âat least partly, a little Eastern home,
a father and mother there who look to
the love of a daughter for that which
they can no longer earn for themselves.
At least it*is another facet of the Ber
tram make-up and adds another glint
to the shining cheerfulness that Is its
chief characteristic.
"And how long have you been in vau
deville?" I inquire.
"Twelve weeks," replied the fair vau
devillaine.
"And how long do you intend to stay
in It?". I inquire again.
"About â well about as long as my
husband's patience holds out," she
laughed. "They have booked us to
gether next season" â
"Wha-at!"
"Oh, I mean in the same towns at
the same time," Miss Bertram ex
plained, "we don't appear together in
vaudeville for at least another season!
So you see we can be together in that
way. He'd make me leave the stage if
we couldn't. And that is right. I need
him and-Jie needs me. I don't believe
in these theatrical separations."
"What does Mr. Morgan play next
year?" I asked then, after agreeing
with Miss Bertram as to "theatrical
separations."
"He has a new play of Hall Caine's,
'The Prodigal Son.' It was written for
Mr. Morgan," his wife told me. Then
she put her finger to her lips and said,
"But it's rather a secret ,yet," so you
need not say that I told you.
"Isn't it rather fun to do this?" Miss
Bertram suddenly asked me then. "You
must see lots of queer people â mercy,
don't say that! But I was telling Mr.
Morgan this morning â he was putting
ice on my poor head, by the way â that
your kind of work must be lots of fun.
It must be fun to be clever enough to
do it, isn't it?"
"It is," I replied feelingly; "how
much?"
"I meant it," Miss Bertram avowed
soberly. "I have a little daughter â
you'd better not put that in, though, it
spoils business â who has a talent for
writing. She^ wrote a book review that
was really fine."
"Ah! Henley's daughter," I ex
claimed; "the niece of W. E. Henley?"
Miss Bertram nodded . assent, and
then told me something of her former
husband, the actor Henley â "Ted," the
weak and gifted flower of the Henley
flock. Something also she told of the
crippled W. E. Ifenley, friend of Ste
venson, poet and litterateur, and of the
other brother. "Tony. 7 artist, also with

any doubt that they were excep
tionally musical here. Something like
New Orleans, in fact. Remarkably like
New Orleans, now she thought about it.
"That must be the opera," I ex
claimed. "New Orleans has had its
opera just as the Tivoli has given it to
us here, only for a longer period. And
you really found a public like San
Francisco's there?" Miss Bertram has
just "played" New Orleans for two
weeks at their Orpheum.
"Wonderfully like," the singer said,
â¢quite evidently the result of the same
conditions, the operatic plenty that has
prevailed in both places."
'And now, how do you like vaude

confined to the Caramelitps â so 1
k bought I would betake me Orpbeum
v>ard this week to see Miss Bertram.
Oirls, he was there! I dimly mad*
him <^ut in the gloom half a mile or so
uway in the orchestra, as J went in.
The plump shadow at the piano, with a
lagh light on his bald crown, was
Â«-f course Mr. Rosner. and the tall,
hhaptly apparition at Mr. Morgan's
ride the happiest woman in the world,
Hel.-n Bertram. There was a desultory
rote or two coming from the piano â
not. curtly. "Tossi<?. you are my only.
~o-on!y7" â and then silence. That was
my opportunity. 1 stumbled through
the darknessâ such dark, after the
(iazzlinp of the morning sun! â and a
moment later was one of the little
Jlembrandt-like proup about the piano.
And then, piris. I had the honor of
rhaking hards with Mr. Morgan â we
are old acquaintances, -with Mr. Rosner,
ihe cleverest trick orchestra leader I
know of. and with Miss Bertram, the
only stranger of the trio. There was
trouble a-brew 1 discovered. Like many
another explorer of the vaudeville
wilds Miss Bertram had found her
equipment lacking in fitness. Her
songs had been voted o'crtine for the
audience, and she was in search of the
popular ditty. The "Tessie, you are
my only" I had heard has no illusion,
and Miss Bertram came up still hum
ming the thing.
â¢'How d'ye do?" she laughed, putting
out a warm, substantial hand. The
lijrht glinted or her little white teeth,
and on a pair of the merriest, prettiest,
gypsy gray eyes you would want to
fee. "Tessie, you are my only, only,"
Bbe hummed. "Isn't it comical to sing
that sort of thing? Helen Bertram in
search of a 'chune' â trying to please â
good material, eh?"
"Scrumptious*," I said, "and do you
come before or after the dog?"
"JuÂ«?t" after," the other sing-er smiled.
"Mike." the week's dog, sings tenor, as
everybody knows.
"An<l what does Mr. Morgan think
about all this?" I asked.
"I know nothing about it," that gen
tleman said. He was sitting on the
orchestra rail and looking rather as
if he would have preferred to be some
where else. Nor did his looks belie
him. Mrs. Morgan told me afterward
that- her husband's objections to her
vaudeville venture were lively, if po
lite, and that she intended to be a good
i?irl soon and give it up.
"I know nothing of music," Mr. Mor
gan hartily deprecated.
. "Only of musicians," I murmured,
noting the prideful glance that flew
over Miss Bertram's way. Girls, it's
no use. Mr. Morgan is MARRIED!
"Are you not," 1 ventured then, tak
ing in. as my c-yes grew more used to
the dark, a very tanned and hand
somely filled out actor, "are you not
getting â er â plump?"
The actor allowed, doubtfully,
"Maybe â but I've just lost sixteen
j>ounds."
Miss Bertram's quick and laughing
"I think he looks splendid. He's just
been roughing it in a Washington log-
King camp," made me understand that
one must not call Mr. Morgan â erâ
plump. Nor is he. He is only
plumper.
"It is tremendously becoming,
though," I whispered to the lady, and
then Mr. Morgan left us to our chat.
We went upstairs to the Orpheum
boardroom and took seats at the table
where they decide whether or not the
ISabe! McKinleys are worth their salt â
their very expensive salt.
By the way â about that fabulous
S1250 a week that Miss McKinley was
Kupponed to be paid Jiere and that I
guiltlessly stated she was paid. Well,
she was. We have seen the bond. We
have been (saving up the information
for Borne months to flaunt it afront
of those kindly contemporaries who
accused us of the sin of credulity.
There now! Whether Miss McKinley
was '.vorth it is another question. The
Orpheum folk would, however, take two
of her at the same price any day they
could pet them. So, I suppose, -she
must have been worth the money to
them. At any rate, it was paid, for we
have, seen the bonds!
But all this is not Miss Bertram,

her cool gray walking suit, her round,
sparkling face olive against the fram

"Do you ever have to look pleasant
when you're hungry?" Fhe began, as
the artist came in for his loot. "I've
not â "
â¢â¢you've not breakfasted," I inter
rupted despairingly. "Of course not.
Nobody I have seen lately has break
faetf-d. Will you ttll me why? Just
think how it makes me feel, a hungry
woman â woree, a hungry man! â to in
terview."
Shfe explained, as she posed, smiling
f-asily at the artist's request, that she
had had ?- headache and didn't want
any breakfast, but that she and Mr.
Morgan were to eat after the inter
view. She had been very anxious about
coming here. You see she had not been
here for eo long, and there were always
people to confute who were looking out
for you to lose your voice. And it was
a pretty critical congregation â not par
ticularly the Orpheum's, but the San
Franciscans generally. There wasn't
The fine "Robin Hood" at the Tiv
oli this week almost recociles one to
the fact that there will be ho grand
opera this season. Almost, that is,
especially -since the rumor that Herr
Conried is to bring the Metropolitan
Operi-house company here in the
spring seems likely to be verified. It
is a truly excellent production, from
â¢i* all points of view. Never before, for
example, have they counted such a
singing cast for comic opera as they
have this week given to "Robin
Hood." Barron Berthald our Con
tinental neighbors spread upon the
grandest of grand opera. He goes
back to Bremen after this season to
do Tristans and things there. Vocal
ly one could ask nothing better than
Mr. 'Berthald's Robin Hood. John
Dunsmure brings a fine broad basso
to the role of Will Scarlett, using it
moreover in a jovial, ample fashion
that leaves no doubt as to his re
source. William Schuster, who has
the role of hid life in Friar Tuck, still
sings a good song, and Arthur Cun
ningham's barytone is as reliable as
ever. One forgets, too, what a really
good little tenor Teddy Webb is. One
could go a long way before finding an
ensemble like that furnished by these
artists.
Dora de Fillippe still possesses the
most valuable voice among the
women. It is full and pentrating and
Miss de Fillippe sings with all her
heart and soul as well as a good level
bead. Kate Condon, the new contral
to, is a very comely damsel, besides
being a charming singer, and is also
an unusually graceful actress. Edith
Mason has more taste than voice â
mayhap also more voice than she
makes use of. But Miss Mason has
still the engaging personality that
made her so well liked in the South
well opera days and is a welcome
member of the new company.
The chorus is simply admirable.
Male and female voices alike are of
the desirable sort, excellently bal
anced, well trained. They sing with all
the spirit in life, and Mr. Steindorff is
to be warmly congratulated on both
the technical excellence of their per
formance and the enthusiasm with
which he has inspired the singers. The
scenic side of things, costuming, set
tings, ranks with the best of the
Eastern productions of the kind, and
Ferris Hartman has covered himself
with glory as a stage manager. Af-,
ter this production of "Robin Hood" it
will be more than ever difficult for the
comic opera road company to "make
good," nor will it be easjvfor the Tiv
oli to live up to its own levels. It
looks "mighty lak" the best thing the
Tivoli folk have ever done.
A word of the new comedian, Wil
lard Sims, who has the famous role of
the Sheriff of Nottingham. Mr. Sims
is an easy and ingratiating comedian,
with enough of a voice and a most
useful fape. He is distinctly clever.
Altogether as the Tivoli gives it, you
can afford to see "Robin Hood" an
other half dozen times. . .
But about that grand opera^ We
get none at the Tivoli this year â only
grand opera. The Conried ru
mors are "splendiferous" â but rumors.
Still, let us pray. And now, would
not this be an excellent year to -bring
up the New Orleans French Opera
Company â to the Alhambra, Mr.
Greenbaum? or to the Majestic, Mr.
Bishop? San Francisco is not used
to going without its grand opera. It
won't like it. It would like the
French opera company, if that com
pany's reception on its last visit here
some years ago is aught to go by. At
any rate the Metropolitan company
does not come â If it does come â until
March next. There is almost all of a
season between now and then. Most
gratefully, I think, some of the time
might be used in listening to the New
Orleans folk.
The company, last season, accord
ing to report, touched its high water
mark, though bad business manage
ment made the season they gave in
New York financially a failure. They
have a repertoire, too, seldom in
fringed upon by the Italians, so that
singers, operas, methods also, would
be new to the local audiences.
There is again the Henry Savage
English Grand Opera Company, that
for some years has been promising a
season here. This, Mr. Savage, is an
acceptable time. Or are there any
wandering Azzali, Lombard!, or other
such grand Italian opera companies,
that will come here to sing, split up
and leave their Collamarinls. Bar
bareschis, Russos, for our after grati
fication? or, perhops, bring with them
a new "La Boheme," with an Agostini
to sing its hero role? 'Tis a good
time to come, and meanwhile the
opera hungry must possess their souls
in patience and take the good "Robin
Hood" the gods have provided..

of music and the like.
With this enviable list comes the fol
lowing letter that, in the belief that its
facts may prove of use to some musi
cians, as they will be of interest to all,
I print. The invitation at the close to
make full use of the library and its
facilities ia open to all musicians:
WASHINGTON. D. C.
Dear Madam: By direction of the Librarian
of Congress I take pleasure in forwarding tu
you a copy of the "Select List of Recent Pur
chases of the Library of Congress" (reprinted
from the Librarian's report for the last fiscal
year), assuming your particQlar interest pos
sibly in that section of the list which ex
hibits the accessions in music (See pp. 80
141.)
The Division of Music In the library was
set apart in the reorganization of the library
in 1837, when all the music that had accu
mulated since the foundation of the. library
in 1SC0 was given into its custody. With the
exception of a few rareties. the collection was
almost entirely the result of deposits under
the copyright law. For reasons connected with
the history of copyright legislation only a por
tion of the music entered for copyright between
ITS:; and ISIS was in possession of the li
brary; but that Issued since 1S10, so far as
representing the press of the United States, was
represented in a collection which was fairly
comprehensive, and, of course, unique. Of
European publications the library in 1S97 pos
sessed very few prior to 1891, and these prin
cipally works by American composers. Since
1SD1, when protection under our copyright
laws was extended to the works of foreign
authors, the collection came to embrace music
which foreign publishers cared thus to enter for
protection. As all the Continental countries
making Important contributions to music, with
the excepUon of Austria-Hungary, Russia, Nor
way and 'Sweden, have been included In thi3
protection, and aa the European publishers
copyrighted the majority of their publications
(and frequently works by Russians. Austrian*,
etc.), the Library of Congress, under the in
ternational copyright law of 1891, ' came to
acquire a very extensive and representative
collection of contemporary European music.
Â¦Withln^the past three years, however, there
has been systematic effort and a very consid
erable expenditure to increase the scope of tha
collection in order to make it a center of
research to the ' student, critic and historian
of music. The accompanying list, although
only a select one, will show to some extent
the character of the acquisitions which have
resulted in pursuance of this policy.
In the report of the Librarian for the past
year the collections In the Division of Music
were thug briefly described:
"The Library of Congress now possesses a
good working collection of the literature on
music fundamental to the student of the history
and theory of music, and the collection of musio
is no longer limited to that which has convÂ»
from copyright. In order that it should also
contain representatives of the best printed
ecores of classical and standard material, the
works of the classical composers have been
purchased in complete editions, ao far as they
have been published; and those of the morÂ«
notable modern masters have been acquired
in a selection intended to represent their com
positions in opera, oratorio, cantata, orchestral
and chamber music.
"Special attention has also been paid to
early American psalmody, civil war music,
and to serial publications of a historical char
acter, such as the Denkmaler der Tonkunst in
Osterreieh. Finally, efforts have been mada
toward the acquisition of dramatic music la
full score, that the student may consult the
standard operas in their original form and at
first source."
Such gaps as necessarily still exist will, it
is hoped, disappear aa the plans for a system
atic development of the collection are carried
into effect.
On July 1, 1003, the total number of volume*
and pieces of music In the Division waa esti
mated at 3B6.735. this being an Increase of
21,224 over the preceding year. In addition,
the- division had in its custody some 470O vol
umes and pamphlets dealing with the history
and theory of music. Not included In this
enumeration was Instructive material estimated
at about B00O volumes, pamphlets and pieces,
Â¦ince set apart in a special section of the col
lection.
The accessions during the past ten months
would bring: the grand total of the collection
to the neighborhood of 4W.C0O items.
This collection will be made aa freely acces
sible as any other in the Library of Congress,
and the Library of Congress in now the Na
tional Library of the United States, entirely
fret* and accessible, without formality. Re
garding itaelf as having a duty to research,
wherever ortgrtnatinic. It la also quJta ready,
within its capacity, to answer inquiries ad
dressed N to it by mail. It would be gratified
at any opportunity that you may afford it
to bÂ« of service to your own investigation*.
Very respectfully.

Chief of the Division of Mualo.

TACOMA, Wash., June 26.â It be
came known to-day, that the Chicago,
Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway pos
sesses one or. more complete surveys
from South Dakota to Puget Sound.
At least one complete survey was
made several years ago, following the
visit to the sound of Roswell Miller,
present chairman of the board of di
rectors. Complete notes have been
secured of other surveys made by en
gineers through both the Rocky and
Cascade mountains more than . ten
years ago for the Union Pacific and
other systems. The survey made , by
the'. Milwaukee road runs west from
Chamberlain, S. D.; passing south of
the Black Hills, thence across Wyom
ing, south of the Bitter Root Moun
tains in Idaho and thence following
the Salmon River to Its confluence
with the Snake River, near the State
line of Washington, Oregon and Idaho.
A community of interests between
the -Milwaukee and Harriman systems
leads to the belief that the former- will
reach Portland over the Oregon Rail
road arid Navigation lines. from East
ern Washington and that the Harri
man system will reach Puget Sound
over the Milwaukee's new road from
the Columbia River to Tacoma and i
Seattle. A number, of, officials of the ,
Milwaukee and the Northwestern Life
Insurance Company, of â¢ Milwaukee
have . been working quietly in . , the
Northwest for weeks. These ' Include
H. H. Field of Chicago, assistant gen^
eral solicitor of the Milwaukee, and
J. T. Woodward, who is understood to
! be a high officer of the Northwestern

sible sale of the property. It is said
that the prospective purchaser is , the
Union Pacific and that the Alton will
shortly become the Chicago end of that
system from Kansas City. The proba
bility of such absorption has long been
discussed and its entire practicability
has always been apparent.
'SThese changes will bring the South
era, Central and Union Pacific, the
Santa Fe, the Alton, the Kansas City
Southern, the Oregon Railway and
Navigation Company and the Oregon
Short Line under one direct control
and would make the E. H. Harriman
system of railroads by far the largest
in the country Irrespective altogether
of the indirect influences exercised by
the Harriman Interests upon what is
known as the Hill group of roads."*

logical conclusion the community- of

suddenly taken a fresh lease of life and

"It Is reported to-day on what seems
to be excellent authority that a change

WHO ARE SAID TO BE LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR A MERGER OF
THE TWO RAILROAD SYSTEMS.
Mrs. G. B. de Martini was the wife
of a prominent grocer residing at 28
West Washington street. In this city.
She leaves several children. Mrs. Frank
Valente was the wife of a teamster
residing at 1757 South San Joaquln
street. She leaves three children, two
of whem .v/ere with her on the train
and escaped serious injury.
Mrs. Valente received a telephone
message this morning Informing her
tliat her brother-in-law was 111 at Mur
pbys and that if Ehe wanted to see him
alive she would have to come quickly.
She was on her way to his probable
deathbed when final summons came
In such awful form for her.
Among others on the wrecked train
Mrs. de Martini and Mrs. Valente
were occupying the rear seats of the
coach with Mrs. Valente's young son
and daughter. They heard the shriek
cf the locomotive and saw the threat
ening oil car dashing down on them.
Mrs. Valente screamed to her children
to Jump, but instead they ran to the
forward end 'of the car. The two wo
men ran out on the rear platform of
the coach and were In the act of leap
ing from it when the crash came. They
.were probably killed Instantly. Their
bodle3 were mangled beyond any sem
blance to human form. Â¦
The name of the engineer of the'run
away locomotive could not be learned
from this city. He is reported to have
disappeared at once after the wreck.
Report blames him for the catastrophe.
The railroad people refuse to discuss
the wreck or give any particulars, save
thf barest facts.
DISAPPEARS AFTER WRECK.
The wcrk train locomotive, pushing
the heavily loaded oil car in front of
it, started down the switchback. Engi
neer F. Cook of the passenger train
Â¦was leaning out of his cab .watching
the approach of the oil car when sud
denly he noticed that something had
gone wrong. The oil car and locomo
tive were running down the Incline at
too great a speed. It did not dawn
upon him that his train was threatened
by a death dealing runaway, however,
until he heard the screeching of the
runaway locomotive's whistle and a
moment later saw the engineer and
firemen leap for their lives.
Cock stayed at his post and took the
only chance for saving the lives of his
passengers. He jerked open the throt
tle of his engine, but in his haste he
gave It too much steam and the
drive wheels spun around on the
track without starting the train. In
the meantime the runaway had attain
ed a mile a minute speed.
The oil car struck the rear of the
passenger coach, split It and hurled the
â¢wreck high in the air. The oil car con
tinued apparently unchecked and bat
tered to splinters the end of the bag
gage car. The passengers were mixed
up r.ith thÂ© wreckage, but. almost In
credible as It seems, there were but two
killed.
The passenger train was due at An
pels at 6:15 o'clock and was late. It
passed a work train at the El Rico
mice and received orders to take an
oil car from there 'to Angels. The pas
penger train was made up of the loco
motive, three freight cars, a combina
tion baggage and smoker and a pas
senger coach. Conductor A. Decker of
the passenger train gave orders for the
work train locomotive to get the oil
car ar.d couple it to the passenger
coach. The passenger train was stand
ing on the main line with the rear end
of the train extending a short distance
up the lower end of a long switch
back.

Ted Melone, a ball player of the
Mail nine of this city, was the worst
hurt of the injured. He had his arm
and shoulders cut badly and sustained
severe bruises.
STOCKTON. , June 25.â Two women
were killed and several other passen
gers were Injured this evening by the
telescoping of a Sierra Railway pas
eenger coach by a runaway oil car
and locomotive near Melones. By a
seeming miracle, all of the occupants
of the coach, with the exception of the
two women, escaped with their lives,
for the car was eplit from end to end.
The wreck occurred at tha El Rico

WOOSTER, Ohio. June 25.â Mrs.
Grace Viola Culvert Taggart of San
Francisco, wife of Major E. F. Tag
gart, transport quartermaster, reached
this city this morning and filed an an
swer to the petition of her husband for
divorce. Mrs. Taggart came determined
to see her Boys, aged 9 and 6 years,
whom she charges Taggart spirited
away from her in San Francslco. She
learned that the children were at the
home of Taggart's parents, and after
considerable trouble managed to have
a talk with the little chaps. The latter
were overjoyed to see their mother, the
younger boy crying bitterly to go with
her when she left. \
Mrs. Taggart filed an answer and a
cross-petition to the application for di
vorce, denying the major's allegations
in toto. Mrs. Taggart says that on two
occasions, while in Manila, Taggart,
without cause or provocation, struck
her on the face with his fists. The first
of these occasions was about Septem
ber 1, 1901, and the second a week later.
Taggart, she says, was intoxicated.
Later, at Fort Leavenwortb, Kansas,
she says, he threw her against a chif
fenier, dislocating her jaw. A short
time afterward he struck, her repeat
edly and so violently thaÂ£ v ,sj!Â»&was com
pelled to. have medical assistance for
many. days. '
She alleges, further, that on the oc r
casion hereinbefore mentioned she was
invited out to a social gathering, of
which Major Taggart knew, and "that
she -attended this gathering at" his" re
quest and with the understanding that
he would call and take her home. Tag
gart did not call, although friends tele
phoned to his home. In company with
Captain Poor and wife and. Lieutenant
Fortesque she went to her home, but
was unable to gain admission, and she
then went to the residence of Captain
Poor, accompanied by Mrs. Poor.
While at Captain Poor's, Major Tag
gart telephoned and wanted to know if
it would be necessary to send -an am
bulance " for Mrs. Taggart, meaning
thereby that she was intoxicated. Cap
tain Poor told Major Taggart of their
failure to gain admission to the' house
and that she would again return, which
she did, in company with Captain Poor.
This time, Mrs. Taggart alleges, Tag
gart seized her and in his anger and
rage tore the clothing completely from
her body and beat her so that her en
tire body was discolored and bleeding
and her condition such that it was be
lieved she would die. She says that he
desisted in his beating only because of
the pleading of the eldest boy. Taggart,'
she alleges, was drunk on this occasion.
Mrs. Taggart says that her husband
was guilty of qther extreme cruelty,
falsely accusing her of infidelity, which
he knew was untrue. She asserts that
Major Taggart's , conduct became
known to his superior officers, that he
was threatened with "court-martial arid
for a time was actually confined, with
a sentinel over him.
Mrs. Taggart charges that Major
Taggart upon his discharge began writ
ing scandalous letters to army officers
and ' threatening proceedings for di T
vorce. .
Major Taggart, ; about May 21, 1904,
pretending to want to take the chil
dren on a transport, got possession' of
them and .came to Ohio, according to
the wife's statement. She declares that
Major Taggart is not a suitable person
to' care for them, that he gets intoxi
cated and uses vile language before
them. Mrs. Taggart insists that she is
entitled to the possesion of the children.

Discovery in France of a

IS CONQUERED
The negroes were placed In the tanks
and their names registered on the de
tention book. Williamson is a Jamaica
negro and Smith a native of South.
Carolina.- Both came here to fill the
places of strikers. Williams was under
arrest a few weeks ago for carrying a
concealed weapon.
"I hardly know how it happened," he
said. "A crowd of men Jumped us.
They knocked Williams down and fired
at us. I-think there weie five of them.
I thought they would kill me, so I de
fended myself."
The other negro. Williams, who is
about. 22 years old, was unmistakably
scared. "There were crowds - and
crowds of men." h? declared.
"I saw, several revolvers, then some
thing hit me on the head and I did not
see or. hear anything for about five
minutes."
At the City Prison Smith was, or pre
tended to be. still very much fright
ened.
Many -people saw a number of men
lurking in the. ' vicinity before tho
trouble took place, but allvjthe descrip
tions are extremely vague. Immedi
ately after the last shot was fired John
O'Connell saw two negroes running vp
Geary street from Polk. One of them,
whose description fits Smith, was put
ting a revolver Into his pocket as he
ran. . :.'\
Policeman Owen found an empty re
volver lying on tha sidewalk near
where Gallagher fell. This leads to the
theory that the many revolvers al
leged to have been seen by the fright
ened negroes were empty or loaded
with blank cartridges. It is believed
that the purpose of the strikers was to
Intimidate the non-union men into
quiting the stables. Several witnesses,
hqwever, declare that more than two
shots were fired, thus tending to show
that the negroes were first fired upon.
Smith, frenzied by terror, as he said
last night, drew a revolver, whic'n ho
always carried- At 6ight of It his as
sailants drew back. The negro* fired a
shot and the men began to scatter.
Again Smith's pfstol rang out, this time
with deadly effect. Anthony Gallagher
threw his arms wildly upward, stag
gered against a wall and collapsed, an
inert mass, on the pavement.
Gallagher's companions did not wait
to learn the fate of their comrade. They
'fled in different directions, and as yet
the police have no clew to their iden
tity. The negroes immediately after
the shooting ran into the Excelsior sta
bles, where they were found and taken
into custody by Policeman Dan Owen.
Gallagher was hurriedly placed in an
ambulance but died on the way to tha
Central Emergency Hospital. It was
found that the bullet had entered his
head on the right side near thÂ© back of
the skull. This would show that he
was attempting to escape when Smith
fired.
Mrs. Gallagher, wife of thÂ» dead
man. soon heard of the tragedy.. Sho
arrived at tha hospital, carrying her
young baby, shortly after her hus
band's body was removed and her piti
ful cries caused an excited crowd to
gather.
Gallagher was a member of tha Sta
blemen's Union In good standing, as a
card found in his pocket showed. Ha
has been out on strike and tha police
believe that his companions wera also
striking stablemen.
In a row over labor troubles An
thony Owen Gallagher, a striking sta
bleman, was fatally shot last evening
by James Smith, a non-union negro
hostler in the employ of the Excelsior
Stables. The trouble occurred shortly
after 7 o'clock on Polk street, between
Post and Geary.
Smith and Arthur Williams, another
negro, also employed at the stables,
were returning from a restaurant. As
they passed Walnut avenue, five men
who had been crouching: behind a,
building leaped suddenly out upon the
two negroes.
"Throw up your hands," was the or
der shouted. The negroes quickly
obeyed. They were so badly frightened
that It seemed to them that every onÂ©
of their assailants flourished a revolver.
They will swear that several pistols
were displayed.
William* received a blow on tha head
from the butt of a pistol and fell to
the pavement stunned. At the same
time several shots were fired* by the at
tacking party, presumably Into the air,
for they were so close to the negroes
that had they shot to kill they could
not have missed.

FRESNO, June 23.â The San Fran
cisco and Bakersfield Santa Fe limited
and the Vlsalla local met In a head-on I
collision this afternoon at 5 o'clock just j
outside the Fresno yards. Trains No. |
3 and No. 23 are now on the tracks a !
dilapidated heap of splintered boards :
and scrap iron. Several persons were
injured, some seriously, and it Is a
marvel that many are not now lying In
the City Morgue. The blame for the
collision has not been fixed.
The Injured are: Arthur
fireman on the Limited, whose left arm
Is crushed badly. It is feared it will
have to be amputated. Local physi
cians insisted upon amputation-, but
friends took him to San Francisco this
evening with the hopes of saving the
arm. Charles Hill, the engineer on the
Limited, had his left leg broken and an
ankle badly bruised. The trainmen on
the local jumped in time to escape the
crash. The conductors on both trains
escaped without a scratch. . .
Among the passengers injured were
Samuel Samuelson, a fruit buyer in the
employ of Castle Bros. He had his left
foot very badly crushed. It was caught
between the cars as he started to jump
from the train. Ora Jones, 11 years
old, who was on the Visalia train, had
her head out of the window and was
severely bruised. Wing Hing was the
worst Injured passenger on the Vlsalla
train, as he sat in tHe front seat of the
smoker. His head and shoulder were
cut and he was braised considerably.
: After picking: himself up . from the
wreck he started across the fields and
has not been seen since. B. O. Farmer,

why the conductors were not aware of

not clear. The limited had just rounded
the curve, leaving Fresno station when
it met the Visalla train, which was
running at full speed. A freight train
on a switch obstructed the view and
the engineers saw nothing of the dan
ger till the two trains were upon each
other.
When the two engineers saw the
danger, whistles were blown and
emergency brakes put into action, but
It was too late. The train crew on the

SAN BERNARDINO, June 25.â Had
the overland train on the Santa Fe
Railroad been reported late to-day, and
it was late, a soldier train sidetracked
at Needles would have gone out on the
main line and been run into by a train
of five coaches which had broken a
drawhead at Ibex, some ten miles-far
ther up the steep grade, and which
went through Needles burning the
brakes. The accident occurred just as
a freight train consisting of a caboose
and eleven coaches of the interurbaii
type was going into the siding. A sec
tion of the train broke away and
started back down the steep grade.
A brakeman placed a red flag on the
head end Of the runaway train and set
the hand brakes, j At Java the train
slowed up some and he jumped. At
Kleinfelter the westbound local had
taken the siding for the overland just
in time to avoid a head on collision
with the wild train. At Needles two
special trains of soldiers were on the
Biding waiting for the overland and a
large crowd was gathered about the
depot. The main line was cleared. The
runaway train passed through there at
a rate of thirty miles per hour,' creat
ing much excitement. The brakes were
burning up. Immediately the yard
crew pursued with the switch engine
and caught the runaway train on a
small grade four. miles east of that
place.

But little warning was given and
no one except the trainmen had time

ST. PETERSBURG, June 25.â The
general staff has received the following
dispatch from Lieutenant General Sak
haroff, under date of June 25:
"Since the morning of June* 23 the
enemy has continued to advance to
ward Kaichou. Three detachments of
cavalry, each consisting of four, or five
squadrons, led, and were followed by
dense lines of infantry, behind which
are marching columns of the line. The
Japanese outposts toward evening ex
tended along the Ho Valley, about nine
miles south' of Senuchen; with the cav
alry posted in the rear. The infantry,
with machine guns, held the village of
Motsiatung, on the right flank. There
was firing all day long. We had one
man wounded.
"The frontier guards under Sub-
Lieutenant Demeyer ambuscaded and
fired upon a squadron of Japanese cav
alry, which lost considerably, ten of
their horses being killed.
"There had been no further advance
of the enemy toward Kaichou up to 1
o'clock yesterday afternoon since June
21, when a movement of the Japanese
was observed from Khanza, Jn '. the
southern Siuyen road, toward Kai
chou, along the mountainous route
from Khanza leading northward to
Slakhotung.
"The Japanese on June 22 occupied
the village of- Siandiao, but toward
evening evacuated the j place under
pressure by a detachment of our van
guard n
"The enemy concentrated three bat
talions, with six guns and four squad
rons oJ cavalry, at Matsiavaitze, and
at dawn of June 23 a detachment con
sisting of a battalion of infantry, two
guns and two squadrons of cavalry
suddenly attacked a company of our
vanguard bivouacking at Sandiao and
forced the company to 'retire. The
Japanese occupied Black . Mountain,
north of Siandhiao, and also the pass
east of Sandiao, on the Slkhotung road.
"The Russians concentrated on the
heights near Siakhotung. Four com
panies with guns were ordered to move
from Siakhotung over, the pass to Sian
dao. The Japanese were dislodged from
thejr position by our artillery, and our
detachment, reinforced, proceeded at 11
o'clock in the morning to attack the
whole of the enemy's front. The enemy
fell back in utter disorder, and Sian
diao was reoccupied at 1 o'clock In the
afternoon. Our artillery fire forced
back the Japanese, who retired precipi
tately beyond Eritakau. ' â¢

three officers- and fourteen soldiers
wounded and one man missing. The
officer commanding the detachment

Russian force was wounded.
"At 11 oVlock in the morning of June
22 a Russian detachment reconnoiter-
Ing three miles to the eastward of
Aiyangamen exchanged shots with the
enemy's vanguard. At about noon the
Russians advanced and attacked the
Japanese on the right Hank, dislodging
them from several advanced fortified
positions.
"A Russian detachment at 5 o'clock
in the afternoon approached the en
emy's main position and found, it occu
pied by three regiments of infantry,
with eighteen guns. The Russians held
their position until 9 o'clock, not at
tacking the Japanese because of the
latter's superior force, and not being
attacked. Our detachment then retired
in perfect order toward Saimatsze. Our
losses are Jfiot yet known.

ports that on Thursday last, June 23,
his patrol boats discovered the battle
ship Peresviet and seven other vessels,
accompanied by nine torpedo-boat de
stroyers, near the entrance to Port
Arthur harbor. They warned him by
wireless telegraphy and he immediately
advanced his entire fleet, except those
engaged upon special duty. The ad
miral then discovered that the Russian
fleet, which consisted of six battleships,
five cruisers and fourteen destroyers,
evidently had planned a dash south
ward by sundown.
The Russians stopped outside the en
trance to the harbor and after nightfall
a fleet of Japanese torpedo-boat de
stroyers resolutely attacked the Rus-
Eian ships and succeeded in torpedoing
and sinking a battleship of the Peres
viet type and disabled the battleship
Svastopol. A cruiser of the Diana type
was observed b'eing towed into harbor
on Friday morning, and it was evident
she had sustained serious damage.
The Japanese ships sustained little
damage. The torpedo-boat destroyer
Shirakumo was hit by a shell, which
fell In the cabin, three men being killed
and three wounded. The Chldori, a ves

SALT LAKE, June 25.â Mrs. Mary
Judge, a millionaire widow of Salt
Lake, is defendant in habeas* corpus
proceedings brought in the Interest of
two Japanese girls, j servants in her
household. The girls were brought
from Japan by Mrs. Judge last year.
At that time* Mrs. Judge was detained
by the customs officials at San Fran
cisco, her baggage searched and the
collection of duty on several thousand
dollars' worth of silks enforced. The
Japaneese girls assert they are held
virtually as slaves in the Judge home,
are slapped repeatedly and without
cause by members of the family and are
beaten on the head with brooms. They
are not permitted to receive visit3
from their 'countrymen and are not,
they claim, allowed to leave the house.
One of them succeeded in throwing
& note to a Japanese cook in a neigh
boring house two days ago and he
caused the legal action to be taken.
Mrs. Judge refuses to discuss the mat
ter and permits no one to see the
girls. A messenger with a note for
the girls was forcibly ejected from the
house and a special. delivery letter was
returned.
. The case will be heard in the Dis
trict Court Monday. Mrs. Judge is a
heavy stockholder in the Silver King
mine and owns much valuable Salt
Lake real ' estate.

BRING CRUELTY CHARGE
CHICAGO, June 25.â A remarkable
suit at law to determine the final dls-)
position of the $500,000 estate of the late
Thomas VL Jordan of the Chicago
Board of Trade has been begun before
Judg-o Marcus Kavanaugh in the Su
preme Court.
The suit comes as an entire surprise
to the widow of Jordan and the other
heirs. It was brought by George C.
Ida. of London, once pastor of Unity
Church In this city and later a Shake
spearean actor. Jointly with his wife,
Louise Jordan Miln, who Is a daughter
of the dead Board of Trade man. Miln
xns the pulpit successor of the Rev.
Robert Collyer. His wife has made a
name as an English novelist.
Dorm* the last week the Mllns, with
an English barrister, Henry Wellington
Wack, have been in Chicago engaged
In an examination of court records re
lating to the management of the estate
In Question by Mrs. Anne J. Jordan,
widow cf the capitalist.
Based on this investigation, sensa
tional charges are to follow in the
courts regarding an alleged attempt to
deprive the Mllns of their share of the
Jordan estate allotted to the daughter
by the will. In substance, the plaintiffs
charge that for sixteen years the in
come from the Jordan estate has not
been rightfully distributed, and the
sums of money forwarded from Chi
cago to the daughter in London have
been Insignificant compared to those to
which she was rightfully entitled.
Reports from mercantile sources
have not revealed any marked change
in condition, but, while the lower level
of activity is still manifest, there
seems to be no progressive shrinkage.
Reports of gross earnings of railroads
show Improvement for June thus far,
the ''average earnings of all roads
showing a good percentage of earnings
over last year. An important factor
in maintaining the firm tone of the
week's market was the rise in United
States securities! Xo very definite
new? of improvement in that trade was
received to explain the buying of the
stocks, but the rise was important to
the whole market. So was the relaxa
tion of the pressure on Southern
Pacific, wh*ich has been bought on all
occasions of weakness since the an
nouncement of the preferred stock is
tue by bankers usually Intrusted with
financial operations for the company.
Bond prices have moved upward
during the week, with the exception of
some of the speculative isBues.
United States new 4s registered have
declined 1-8 per cent on call during the
week.
Prices of stocks have crept upward
this week, slowly and somewhat la
boriously. Business has been in small
volume on the Stock Exchange and the
fluctuations have been exceedingly nar
row, but the tone of the market has
been unmistakably firm, and the senti
ment In the Wall street section has
been more cheerful and hopeful over
the new market. The market has been
almost entirely free from pressure, and
the small advances met little resistance
in the way of selling to realize or bear
attack. The news of the market has
not been important and was decidedly
mixed in character, but the news un
favorable to values was accepted as
further deveolpment of factors long
recognized in the situation and consid
ered in the operations for some time
past. There has been a general disposi
tion to feel that the worst of these de
velopments is over. Underlying the
stability of the market la the content
ment felt with the condition of the
crops and a conviction that, in the ab
sence of some change in conditions, the
country may feel secure of profitable
harvests.
CONDITION' UNCHANGED.
STOCKS CRAWIj UP.
XEW YORK, June 25.â The stock
market made some stand early to-day
against the reactionary tendency yes
terday, but yielded at the close and
showed small net losses for the day.
The result Is to leave the week's
change* Quite small. The dealings to
day were Indifferent to the point of Ufe
lessness. A fractional rise in Union and
Southern Pacific and a steady tone in
the Wabaehes, Indicating the passing
effect of the remission of Interest on
the debenture bonds, were the encour
aging: factors. The bank statement
contained no great surprise, but It was
entirely without stimulating effect. The
Increase in cash reserves was nearly
In accord with calculations and brought
that Item to a n%w high level. The
$17,000,000 loan Increase wants only to
be repeated to bring that item to a new
high level. To-day's deposits of $1,143,
314,100 exceed by over $11,000,000 the pre
vious record made early last month
Just previous to the withdrawal of Gov
ernment deposits from the banks for
the Panama canal. Greatly curtailed
demand for money in the channels of
trade Is a deduction from this condi
tion of the money market. But grow
ing discussion is given to the part
played by bids for deposits by the
banks and trust companies in causing
this condition, and the soundness and
healthfulness of the policy In such a
money market as that existing at pres
ent.
The total soles of bonds, par value,
were Jl.347.000.

Sol Getz & Son report that the sale of
lots in the Oceanside district is going
on steadily and improvements are con
stantly being 'made. The demand for
homes is unabated and places to rent
are exceedingly scarce. The Spring Val
ley Water Company has laid pipes on
the boulevard as far south as M street,
where Beveral houses are being con
structed. It is the intention of the
water company to tap the whole dis
trict.
The publication of the condition of
affairs revealed by the investigation, as
far as it has gone, into the causes con
tributing to the tragedy of the New
York steamer General Slocum has
caused commuters and excursionists
throughout the land to view with wide
awake interest the state of things ex
isting on passenger steamers plying In
his own locality. Nowhere is
the interest more' vital than in
the vicinity of San Francisco,
and It will be with deep satisfaction
that local travelers by water learn that
under the jurisdiction of the local gov
ernment inspectors nothing has been
left undone to insure against anything
so dreadful happening on any passen
ger boat in these waters.
There arc few excursion steamers
here, but many ferry-boats, and as the
latter are frequently Â£ven more crowd
ed than was the General Slocum the
necessity is just as great for obedience
to the wide-reaching regulations set
upon the statute books for the protec
tion of human life.
President Roosevelt after the Slocum
tragedy issued an order for the rein
spection of all excursion steamers
throughout the United States. The lo
cal inspectors find that at this port
there is not a passenger steamer which
is not equipped in full accord with the
Federal laws.
At each inspection every life-pre-
is the Ramona, which runs between
San Diego and Ccronado. Not only is
she equipped with bulkheads and fire
fighting apparatus, but Captain P.
Johnson, her commander, has adopted
a plan whereby the proper way to put
on a life preserver is made plain to
all.
Johnson has had taken a series of
photographs showing the captain put
ting on a life preserver. Cards on
which these pictures are printed are
posted in conspicuous places. To fol
low these directions all that is required
is eyesight and Inspector Bulger
recommends the Johnson plan for all
passenger steamers.
* "We have no excursion steamers
here," said Inspector Bulger yesterday,
"in the sense that they have in New
York, but on every boat we have the
Federal requirements have been com
plied with. No precaution prescribe^
by the law has been overlooked. Our
inspections always have been rigid and
in most cases we find the owners of
vessels ready to co-operate with us
and to follow suggestions even when
they involve work the performance of
which the' law does not give us author
ity to compel. Over the personal equa
tion we have no control and to show
how much that figures I have only to
cite the case of the steamer South
President of Board of Education Will
Seek Latest Ideas in Modern
Architecture.
President Roncovieri of the Board
of Education will leave to-day for a
visit to the St. Louis Exposition and
the East. He will combine business
with pleasure while away. In Xew
York City he will confer with M. Sny
der, special architect of the New York
Board of Education, with a view to
observing the architectur? of .school
buildings there. New York has recent
ly expended $26,000,000 for new school
buildings, most .of which are of stone
and brick and strictly fireproof. .'â¢
Roncovieri has been in comunlca
tion with Snyder for several months
and has photographs and' blueprints of
some of the modern school buildings,
but he desires to make a personal in
vestigation to aid him in designating
the character of buildings to be erect
ed under the bond issue now before
the Supreme Court for decision as to
its validity.

Portland as compared with the case
of the Charles Nelson. This oflice is
ready to stand on its record."
The local inspectors took up the mat
ter of fire hose some time ago. The old
system of keeping ft on a reel was
abandoned, and now on every ferry and
excursion steamer on this coast the fire
hose is always spread and ready for
immediate use. Further than this, the
pumps, supplying the water for this
hose never stop, and there Is always
considerably more pressure than is
found in thp average city main. By the
pulling of a lever, which is within easy
reach, the fire hose with a strong
stream of water Is available to any
body on board the boat. There Is j a
tire drill on, every boat once a week.
"More water-tight bulkhAds" is the
text of the sermon the local inspectors
would preach, and they never, iose an
opportunity of advising their construc
tion when possible.
The model ferry boat of the Pacific
Coast, says Inspector John K. Bulger,
FIRE FIGHTING APPARATUS.
The Importance of life-preservers, ac
cording to the local Inspectors, is some
times exaggerated, and although they
exact full compliance with the law in
the matter of these cork jackets, they
insist upon other and in their opinion
more important precautions.
Water-tight bulkheads, for which the
law does not provide, and adequate
fire-fighting apparatus are the two
things most desirable, say the inspect
ors, in a ferry or excursion steamer.
With the dangers of the boat sinking
or burning eliminated, passengers
would have a better chance on board
than in the water, even if encased in a
dozen life-preservers.
Additional bulkheads have been built
lately in nearly all the bay passenger
steamers. When the San Rafael sank
bulkheads were the exception. Imme
diately following that disaster the Sau
salito and Tiburon boats and the Santa
Fe ferry steamers were each equipped
with three water-tight bulkheads, and
to these others are being added as op
portunity offers. '

of old age. On the steamer Newark,
which returned to duty yesterday after
having been -laid oft for several days
for purposes of inspection, several high
piled truckloads of preservers were con
demned. An inspection of these showed
that few of them appeared to be in
very bad condition, most of them hav
ing been rejected because their canvas
jackets had become discolored. On each
Southern Pacific ferry-boat from 600 to
700 additional life-preservers has been
placed.

concludes with a warning tÂ« his wife
to be careful of any money that comes
to her and asks her to try and teach
his little girls to think kindly of their
father.

It was at this juncture that the other
team drove up, and failing in nerve the
robbers, instead of commanding the
driver of the second rig to halt, started
on a run for the brush. Their capture
Ib doubtful.
The stage was being driven by B. E.
Travis, the owner, and three passen
gers were aboard. It was near Tipton
that the bandits stepped out from the
brush into the road and ordered the
driver to halt, at the same time leveling
guns at his head. There was nothing
for him to do but obey, and the horses
were brought to a standstill. One of
the robbers then told the passengers to
file out of the rig and line up on the
road so they could be relieved of their
valuables.

masked men held up the Whitney-Can

flight as many times as desired, and
the time as recorded by the judges will
be the average time in which it covers
the full course. No trial will be con
sidered unless the full course is cov
ered, and the aeronaut must make the
complete trips around the course at an
average speed of at least twenty miles
an hour. The trials will continue dur
ing the months of July, August and
September. Twelve acres inclosed by a
fence thirty feet high near the Admin
istration building of the fair constitute
a windbreak and a starting point for
the races. The competitors Include all
the great airship Inventors of the world
âSantos Dumont, Sir Hiram Maxim,
Professor Langley, Leo Stevens, Octave
Chanute and others already well known
will be among the .number.
Dr. August Greth of San Francisco
will enter the contest with his airship,
which he has already thoroughly tested
with considerable satisfaction and
which, he says, he has under perfect
control. A Phoenix, Ariz., recluse has
invented a flying machine with a frame
uork of willow twigs made into wings
like those of a bird. The rapid move
ment like a stroke of the bird's wing, he
thinks, will give his machine the neces
sary Â£?eed and buoyancy. He claims
tÂ«i have made several successful tests
of the machine at night. He will not
divulge anything relating to his inven
tion.

animal, bearing an empty packsaddle,
found Its way into the camp of Her

two miners in that vicinity. The horse
was frantic, stamping and snorting un

upon him, when he made off Into the

they came in the early morning upon a
camp in which lay five men who had

the unconscious comrade for many
miles until their strength failed them
and they lay down to die. In all of

SACRAMENTO, June 25.â The Bee
publishes an article which states that
it has just discovered that "Warden
Tell thwarted the plans for another
prison break, in which Jack Brady and
Kid Thompson, who are serving life
sentences for train robbery, and sev
eral other desperate prisoners were the
ringleaders.
The convicts had planned that, com
mencing several days before the exe
cution of Koklchi Hldaki on, June 10,
they were to feign illness and be sent
to the hospital, two or three at a time.
When the death chamber was filled
with officials and free men awaiting
the execution, Thompson, Brady and
the others, were to rush from the hos
pital and close and bar the door to the
death chamber, making the officials and
free men prisoners. They were then
to release Wood, Murphy and Eldridge,

WASHINGTON, June 25.â According
to figures Just completed at the Pen
sion Office the unknown army of old
soldiers not heretofore drawing pen
sions but eligible under President
Roosevelt's new order is far smaller
than had been supposed. It Is believed
it will not exceed 25,000 men.
Though the new law has been In ef
fect for nearly three months and the
Pension Office authorities have been
endeavoring to have this class of veter
ans apply for pensions due them, less
than 5000 applications have been filed.
It was estimated by members of Con
gress and pension officers that there
were at least 150,000 of former . mem
bers of the armies of the Civil War
who were unaccounted for on the rolls.
Now, however, the estimate has been
revised, and It was said to-day that
there were not more than 20,000 old
soldiers alive who were not pensioners.

the death rate has been much higher

POOD FACTS.
What an M. D. Learned.
A prominent physician of Home,
Georgia, went through a food experi-
ence which he makes public:
"It was my own experience that first
ltd me to advocate Grape-Nuts food
and I also know from having: pre-
Bcrlbed It to convaler -Â«nts and other
weak patients that the food Is a won-
derful rebuilder and restorer of nerve
and brain tissue, as well as muscle. It
knproves the digestion and Elck pa-
tients always pain just as I did in
strength and weight very rapidly.
/-TI was in such a low state that I had
to give up my work entirely and go to
the mountains of this State, but two
months there did not improve me; In
fact. 1 was not quite as well as when I
left home. My food absolutely refused
to sustain me and it became plain that
I must change, then I began to use
CJi-ape-Xuts food and in two weeks I
could walk a mile without the least
fatiirue and ln five weeks returned to
:r>y home and practice, taking up hard
work agttin. Since that time I have
frit as well and strong as I ever did In
my life.

hufferers I consider it a duty to make
thf-tse facts public" Name given by

Two" special cars left Montgomery and
Post streets yesterday afternoon at 2
o'clock carrying the directors of the
Pacific Jupiter Steel Company, their
friends and several men interested' in
foundries around San Francisco. A
number of women were of the party.
The destination of the cars was South
San Francisco, where is located the
large plant of the Pacific Jupiter Steel
Company.
On arriving at the works the party,
which was led by Constant Meese, pres
ident of. the company, was taken in
charge" by the several foremen and the
inspection began. The first things of
interest insoected were the huge fur
naces where the molten steel is kept at
white heat, and the spectator's face
must be shielded on approaching the
doors. Near by huge pots are being
heated to receive the boiling fluid when
it is properly "cooked." A huge steel
overhead traveling crane swings heavy
molds and blocks of steel as deftly as a
child handles his toy blocks. Next came
the forges- and the baking ovens for
drying the molds, the emory wheels
smoothing off rough -metal amid a
Bhower of sparks and the crash of saws
cutting their way through metal; the
great automatic chisels- and planes
slicing oft steel shavings.
When the metal had reached a right
consistency the huge pot, containing
seven tons of molten steel, was carried
by the crane to the empty molds, and
each was filled with the seething metal.
That was the most spectacular sight
of the dayâ the showers of sparks
where the metal was pouring and the
multi-colored lambent flames playing
about the vent holes of the molds gave
the scene a fantastic beauty.
About 4:30 o'clock the party boarded
the cars and returned to this city.

The increased census is remarkable
in view of the fact that the census
marshals found great difficulty in pre
vailing upon parents and guardians of
children to sign their names to af
fidavits as provided by a recently en
acted law. In many cases it was im
possible to secure the signatures, but
the deputies under Chief Census Mar
shal Atkinson and his assistant chief,
John G. Fitzgerald, made extraordin
ary efforts with the excellent result
noted.
As the State pays to the city the
sum of $9 for each child of school
age, the school fund of the Board of
Education will receive this year J876,
177, as against 5822,474 for last year,

and Member of W. C.T. U., tells how she
recovered from a serious illness by the use of
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
" Drxn Mrs. FixkitJlm: â I am one of the many of your grateful friends
who hare been cured through the use of Lydia E. Pinkbani's Vegetable
Compound, and rrhocan to-day thank you for the fine health I enjoy. When
I was thirty-five years old, I Buffered severe backache and frequent bearing-
down pains; in fact, I had womb trouble. I was very anxious to get well,
Â¦md reading of the cures your Compound had made, I decided to try it. I took
only six bottles, but it built me up and cured me entirely of all my troubles.
" My family and relatives were naturally as gratified as I was. My niece
tad heart trouble and nervous prostration, and was considered incurable.
She took your Vegetable Compound and it cured her in a &bort time, and she
became well and strong, and her home to her great joy and her husband's
delight was blessed with a baby. I know of a number of others who have
been cured of different kinds of female trouble, and am satisfied that your
Compound is the best medicine for aick women." â Mbs. Elizabeth H. Thompson,
Box 1Â«5, Lillydale, N. Y.
Thousands upon thousands of women throughout this country
are not only expressing such sentiments as the above to their
friends, but are continually writing letters of gratitude to Mrs.
Pinkharn, until she has hundreds of thousands of letters from
women in all classes of society who have been restored to health
by her advice and medicine after all other means had failed.

PARIS, June 25.â The whereabouts of
Kent J. Loomis, brother of Assistant
Secretary of State Frank B. Loomis.
who disappeared shortly, before or after
the arrival of the steamer Kaiser WI1
helm II of the North German Lloyd
line, at Plymouth, June - 20, remains
In the came state of doubt as yester
day. The officials who are conducting
the search for the missing- man say
there Is no.truth In the report publish
ed by a London news agency to the
effect that Loomis turned up here yes
terday. The announcement probably
resulted from confusing the names of
Loomis and W. H. Ellis. The latter
sailed from Marseilles this afternoon
for AJsys sinia.
LONDON, June 25.â The mystery
which surrounds the disappearance of
Kent J. Loomis Is no nearer solution
to-day. Not a solitary clue as to his
whereabouts has resulted from nearly
a week's widespread Investigation. Con
sul General Evans and the Assistant
Consuls have made and are still mak
ing all possible inquiries, but without
the faintest trace of the missing man.
The statement of Gustav Flamm of
San Francisco, a passenger on the
Kaiser "Wllhelm II, that he saw Loomis
at Plymouth Is so far uncorroborated.
The American Consul at that port says
the Board of Trade figures, which pre
sumably tally with the number of pas
sengers who came off the steamer,
show that 158 persons landed, all of
whom gave their names. These tally
with the passenger list and Loomis'
name Is not among them.
At the request of Consul General
Evans the hospitals at Plymouth are
now being searched. Scotland Yard
has the matter in hand and the Eng
lish papers, especially the local papers
at Plymouth, continue to give prom
inence to Loomis,' disappearance, so If
Loomis Is in England and In possession
of his faculties, he could scarcely fall
to know he is being looked foT. The
authorities here are unable to form
even a conjectural explanation of
Loomis' disappearance. The theory
that Loomis fell overboard finds no
support and the suggestion that he
may have unintentionally disembarked
at Plymouth is now regarded as quite
out of the question. t

The Tageblatt has a rather pretty
story of the German Emperor and pic
ture postcards. On his Mediterranean
cruise he was accompanied by his old
gymnastic instructor, but before the
instructor's departure his daughter had
made him promise to send her a'pic
ture postcard signed by the Emperor.
The request seemed scarcely possible of
fulfillment, -but it happened that while
at Gibraltar after lunch the Emperor
sent for some picture postcards, as
usual, and sent them around the table
for the signatures of the company.
They were intended for his own little
daughter, who, as he said, is a keen
collector. The old instructor seized
the opportunity to mention the com
mand laid upon himself, and the Em
peror, smiling, signed one of the cards
and had it sent off to t,he Instructor's
daughter with those , destined ; for the
Princess.â Westminster Gazette.

MAYOR OLNEY of "Oakland has put in definite
shape the v proposition to consolidate Berkeley
and intermediate . towns with Oakland and to
project the same policy across the harbor'and take in
Alameda. The, matter* is under discussion and already it
is apparent that the greatest objection is to the loss of
identity that will befall Berkeley and Alameda when
they become only the city and county of Oakland. ,
The objection is .something more than sentimental
and must be removed; before consolidation can -be ef
fected. Meantime physical consolidation is going on
rapidly. There is . one continuous population from the
'south front of Oakland to the north 'line of Berkeley.
The interurban r electric roads have done that. But each
separate town has pride* of identity "and all are jealous of
the bigger city of Oakland, which wants the name and
the renown. Berkeley has'the university and does not
want that institution transferred . to Oakland, and will
bear the :11s she has rather than cancel her name off
the map. : Â¦ .
When the project for a greater New York took shape
it was met by the same objection, which held it at a
standstill for a long time. Finally a plan was found that
would satisfy the pride of- identity 'and at the 'same time
tongues of the credulous are wagging in tones of amaze
ment. We don't need the boom of this discovery. We
have gold enough in our marts and manufactures, in our
trade and varied industries, to care little for a revival of
the stimulus that gave us our first start in the Western
world of civilization. i
Again the exulting. cry has gone forth that. gold has
been found beneath the streets of San Francisco and the
EAST SIDE CONSOLIDATION.
A Montana convict was pardoned from the peniten
tiary the other day after he had served twenty years of
a life sentence for a crime of which he was guiltless. If
life's rewards and punishments may be estimated in
comparisons, what indeed, must be the thoughts of this
man as he steps again into the .world of freedom^ He
will take small comfort in the fact that by one of the
tragic' mistakes of fate he was made victim. -
BUTTERâ H. C, La Panza, San Luis
Obispo County. Cal. The following Is
given as a method for preserving butter
by salting: "Mix well together one
ounce each of saltpeter and white sugar
and two ounces of the best salt, all in
very fine powder; then add one ounce
of this mixture to every pound of but
ter, and thoroughly incorporate them
together. The butter thus prepared is
then to be tightly pressed into clean
glazed earthenware vessels,' so as to
have no vacant spaces. This : butter
dce3 not taste well until It has stood for
two or three weeks, "after which it ac
quires a rich marrow flavor, which no
other butter possesses. Any good, well
made fresh butter, free from batter
milk, will succeed by this method, but
the application of it to butter clarified
by the Tartar plan produces an, article
that will keep good longer than butter
cured by any other process." The fol
lowing is the Tartar plan alluded to in
the above: "Melt the butter in well
glazed earthen pans at a heat not ex
ceeding 180 degrees Fahrenheit in a
water bath, and keep It heated, skim
ming It from time to time, until the
butter becomes quite transparent; then
pour off the clear into another vessel
and cool it aa quickly as possible by
surrounding It with cold water or ice.
It Is said that butter melted by the
Tartar method and then salted in the
Tnanner above described will keep good
and fine-tasting; for a period of two
years."
Experts have decided that at least seventy-five thou
sand dollars will be necessary to repair the damage to
the great freighter Algoa, whose captain, economically
inspired, tried to bring the .ship safely through the
Golden Gate. Everybody concerned is probably ready
to admit lhat this is a somewhat expensive if not dan
gerous substitute for pilotage. Experience, however, is
too frequently like the stern lights of a vessel, illumin
ing only the path" behind.
NEW YORK, June 19.
Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: We
are told In the Bible that "God created
every winged fowl aft^r hfs kind; and
God saw that it was good. And God
blessed tnem, saying, be fruitful, and
let fowl multiply In the earth."
It is a sad fact that man is not per
mitting the birds of the air to multiply
as God directs: they' are wantonly
killed for sport by men, and boys de
stroy thousands of eggs and nestlings
each year. Fashion decrees that
women must wear the plumage of wild
birds for ornaments. . Glance . at the
bonnets worn at any , church service
and note the large number of graceful
plumes known as, "Aigrettes.". There
is not ' a woman that- does not know
that these plumes are obtained only
by the most cruel and barbarous meth
ods. How can she kneel and partake
of the holy communion while wearing
them?
Can the children of ' the Sunday
schools grow to be goou men and
women unless they are taught that
kindness to all G< s wild creatures Is
a part of Christian life? The Saviour
says a sparrow -"shall not fall on the
ground without your Father." This
certainly means that human- beings
will be held responsible for all acts of
cruelty " to~" even the most humble of
Cod's creatures.
â¢ Birds are a check on insect life and
so lessen the labor of the tiller of the
soil. Scientific study during the past
two. ''""ides has demonstrated the fact
t'-at birds .are the most valuable
friends the agriculturist has; they;de
stroy insect pests and noxious vermin;
they also eat thousands of , tons of
v weed seeds which If left to propagate
would soon overrun the land.
'Birds require no pay for their labors,
they on^y ask to be let done to enipy
in pence and safety the life the Creator
gave them, the same right-that every
good, citizen enjoys. - v

Artists often have to do queer things
to get realistic effects. Recently a
painter who has made something of a
reputation with his pictures of animals
wished to paint a dog tugging at a
rope â straining every muscle to get
away. He thought in this way to make
a vivid reproduction of muscular ten
sion. But it was not easy to get his
model. Finally he hit upon the plan
of starving his own dog until the ani

tying him in the studio Just out of

On Wednesday, March 7, 1S04, "a nu
merous and respectable meeting of per
sons or various denominations'* was
held at the London Tavern, and a so
ciety, formed "ttt promote the circula
tion of the Holy Scriptures In the prin
cipal living languages." At that time
the Bible." or portions of it, could be
obtained in about forty living
languages, spoken by two-tenths of
the race. During the century since tho
meeting at the London Tavern ad
journed, and very largely from the
machinery then and there started, the
Scriptures have been translated Into
450 langauges and dialects, understood
by seven-tenths of the race. By the
London society alone 180,000,000 copies
have been distributed, at an expense of
$70,000,000. If we add to this total the
70,000,000 copies already distributed by
the younger American Bible Society,
and the unknown millions printed and
sold by private enterprise, we find our
selves inside a safe estimate if we hold
that certainly 300,000,000 copies of the
Scriptures, In whole or separate books
or portions, have gone Into circulation
during the last century.
. Amazement attends the study of the
Bible, whatever the point of view or
the course pursued. But nothing about
the Bible Is more amazing than its
continuous,/ universal and utterly un
paralleled popularity. In nearly every
if not every country on earth pvhere
books are sold more Bibles are sold
tban any other book. Last year' the
British and Foreign Bible Society alone
distributed 5,943,775 copies, the majority
by sale. In 370 languages, covering
every part of the globe. And the issue
by the American society for the. year
amounted to 1,993,553 Bibles and por

THE Stockton City Board of Education has placed
itself squarely on record concerning the compensa
tion of teachers in the public schools. Incidentally
the members of the board, submitting a report, have hit
upor. to may topics of general concern; that their rea
soning and presentation of facts have more than the
ordinary interest. The minimum salary of Stockton's
grade teachers is raised from $500 to $600 per annum,
while the maximum grade salary is raised from $850 to
$900. The salaries of the principals of the smaller schools
are increased from $900 to $1000. In the high school
certain salaries are advanced.
Among the conclusions reached by the board some are
worth attention throughout the State. It is set up as an
axiom that among the requisites of teachers are tact in
management, "an even and kindly disposition and the,
health, .strength and ability and inclination for constant
improvement. Added to these specifications the board
holds it to be essential lha teachers shall be possessed
of a moral character above reproach and that they shall
have a social training as shown in personal' manners,'
habits and ilress that will present a good example to the
children.
The action of the board in raising salaries is based
upon several considerations. Stated concisely, these are
that the growing compensation of the Stockton teachers
has not kept pace with the higher standards of work
demanded in the schools; that the more extended train
ing now required takes from two to six years more time
than was formerly noccssury to properly equip the
teacher; that during the period when the cost of living
has increased there has been marked advance in the
salaries in all lines of prci'< ssional work with the excep
tion of those for teaching^ that the time and expense
involved in becoming a competent teacher equal such
tfutliys in fitting for any other profession; that teaches
have a right to a support that bears a just relation to the
kind of work they are cohig and to the ability needed to
do it well. V v ! :
Prior to voting to give the teachers more money for
their services the board inquired how to rate the com
pensation. The coqeiuMon was arrived at that teachers
who have made Icictirg a life work are entitled to the.
largest maximum salary that the city is able to pay. In
lur.king the -adjustment the stand was taken that no
salary should be i educed and that all ought tb be in
creased.
Applying the schedule to salaries .paid the individual
teachers shows an increase for the coming year of 6 to
28 per cent over those that have been paid. The largest
increase is granted to the younger teachers in the school
department, with a substantial increase to those who
have served many years. -K Â¦'**.'
It was found that a schedule based on a "flat" salary
would result in cutting the 'salaries of nineteen teachers
and that basis was dropped without further considera
tion. This question was raised when the board con
fronted an inquiry whether all teachers should be paid
the same salary or should be compensated according to
training and experience. It was also ascertained that
reducing the number of years to elapse before the maxi
mum is reached would cut down the pay of fifteen teach
ers and that idea was rejected. Clearly the purpose' in
Stockton was to "encourage the teachers as much as pos
sible and to provide sufficient salaries to make it an ob
ject for persons of ability to continue to instruct the
young.
STOCKTON TEACHERS' SALARIES.
Let us briefly inquire into those qual
ities which make the King successful
as a diplomatist, which give him his
personal equipment. It is significant
that our present sovereign has made
no tactical mistakes, has, both as
Prinze of Wales and King, turned the
flank of more than one false movement,
and has, by his Intelligence and skill,
won the admiration of Intellectual
men. He has been called shrewd, but I
prefer to think of him as a man of tem
perament and imagination, with an in
stinct as keen as that of a dramatist,
or painter, and with the impulses of
the Instinct rationalized by wide and
high experience, and by the best of
knowledge â that directly gained viva
voce from the ablest men of the world.
In such associations, In this sort of
tuition, he has had the heart of the
thing laid bare, the essentials concise
ly presented for him to apply at once
in the discharge of his public duties.
I believe that the King is naturally one
of the most impulsive men In his em
pire, but his intellectual qualities, and
his capacity for comparison, historical
and immediate, his curious ability in
feeing what "the other man is think
ing," have steadied to powerful use
that temperament which, left to flour
ish unhampered by the convention of
duty, necessity, and high Responsibil
ity, might have been called genius. In
truth, the King has genius of a kind,
if he is not to be called a genius, hap
pily for himself. All that rare faculty
for saying and doing the right thing,
for remembering faces and incidents,
and people and places â it is all the
equipment of the man of temperament,
It is the secret of his popularity.
Geniality Is no name for It, for he feels
when to be genial and he knows when
to be "icily" regular. He is too pow
erful in temperament to be merely
"genial." With such a temperament as
he possesses there is also dormant in
his Majesty a certain Irascibility, due
to his capacity to feel strongly, to the
sharp decision of his mind. He is no
waverer, he does not need to lean on
others, and he has a keen impatience
with the dull or the inane; but long
ago the native irascibility was brought
âand keptâ under control. Still, the
capacity to be wilfulâ to be impetuous,
to be Impulsive â lies at the very root of
his strength. It all belongs to his in
fluence uppn men, quite apart from
the power in the state which he repre
sents. Men who know the things that
count in intellectual equipment have
never underrated the King's knowl
edge; and his capacity for seeing all
sides of a question, thour'i he is known
to take one - * *e very strongly, and
that not from natural predilection but
according to his own judgment, right
or wrong.â Sir Gilbert Parker, M. P.,

The Board of Public Works has decided that the ab
sence of all employes in the office shall be duly recorded
as a check to what appears to be a general neglect of* duty
on the part of many insubordinates. It seems almost in
credible that a municipal department of San Francisco
will become so revolutionary in its methods as even to
suggest that its employes must give to the city an
equivalent for their salaries. The tax-eater has fallen
upon evil days.
John VT. Tompklna, "Warden of the
State Penitentiary at San Quentln. Is
of the opinion that a prison guard who
does not know how to shoot a pistol,
rifle and shotgun Is not of much .value

Warden Tompkins practices that which
he preaches.
He has established a regulation pistol
practice range and a standard 200
yards rifle target range for the service
of his men. And he not only sees to It
that the guards do study to aim
straight, but the Warden himself takes
part in the drill at the targets. Warden
Tompkins is an expert on small arms,
a splendid shot and possessed of fine
technical and practical knowledge of
rifles and pistols.
Several days ago the Warden and
some of his men were shooting- on the
rifle range. The day was very windy
and the brisk breeze that blew over
the unsheltered range was not con
ducive to good work. And It was near
to the close of the day. the light being
none too good. Under these conditions
the 35's, SS's and thereabouts scored
out of possible 50's by the guards were
well .enough. Bnt Warden Tompkins
opened his men's eyes. With ten suc
cessive shots he scored, 46, and the last
bullets were fired at dusk. That stands
as {he record to date. The Warden Is
going to conduct competitive shoots
among the guards. In the nine months
Warden Tompklna has been In charge

on the relation held by plays and works

HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALL..
S HENRIETTA STREET. COVENT
GARDEN. LONDON. June Lâ Until a
few days ago I had no idea, aa probably
was the case with most Americans
who read it, that Richard Whlteing's
story. "The Yellow Van," which at
tracted so much attention on both
sides of the Atlantic, had largely to
do with existing things. It Beems, how
ever, that there really Is a yellow van
and a Land Nationalization Society in
Â¦whose interests the van travels about
through rural England and that the
experiences of those who Inhabit this
vehicle are quite as exhilarating as Mr.
Whlteing made out. / .
This I discovered \rhen the Land
Nationalization Society held a meeting
in London the other day. The society
was founded in 1SS1 by a distinguished
committee, which included Dr. Alfred
Russel Wallace, who hit on the theory
of evolution simultaneously with Dar
win; Miss Helen Taylor, who Is a step
daughter of John Stuart Mill, and A.
C. Swinton, but the organization's
propaganda by means of the yellow
van did not begin until 1S90. For four
teen years straight, however, the orig
inal van (the society now owns two
others) has perambulated the country
and its presiding genius, whose name*
is Hyder, preached the gospel, "The
Land for the People and the People
fcr the Land." In this time some 10,
000 miles have been covered and meet
ings innumerable held. The van, like
the bicycle in the song, is "built for
two," Mr. Hyder, who is the society's
general secretary, and his assistant.
They live exactly such a gypsy-like
existence as Whiteing pictured, spend
ing the night in fields (where Inquisi
tive cows occasionally made things
lively for them), buying their food from
the farming folk and cooking it inside
the van. In most districts the yellow
van's speaker and his leaflets are re
ceived good naturedly enough by the
country' people, though seldom by the
representatives of the landlords. In the
most rural parts, however, where
squirearchy still Is supreme, stones
and rotten eggs propelled in his direc
tion frequently leave Hyder in no
doubt as to the attitude of his hearers.
In such districts, in fact, determined
attacks on the van are by no means
rare occurrences. In one county an
onslaught was made by a mob of stable
boys armed with stones and headed by
the local parsoa. In a Hertfordshire
village, Hyder and his companion were
locked up in the stables where they
were tending their horses, and had to
escape by means of a skylight. Else
where, the creatures of the lord of the
manor tried to throw the yellow van
ard its occupants into a river.

WILLIAM DUTCHER,
Chairman National Committee of Au

His father preceded him as a Cabinet officer, being-a
member of Mr. Cleveland's last Cabinet in the Depart
ment of Agriculture. President Roosevelt has now two
Cabinet officers whose fathers were there before them,
Mr. Taft and Mr. Morton. -' â¢
In that great and distinctly American work Paul Mor
ton has had a distinguished part. The country may 'con
gratulate itself, that the persuasions of the President
have succeeded in securing such a man for the public
service. He is all that William C. Whitney was when
that gentleman was lured out of private and professional
life to begin the building of a navy. He is more than-
William C. Whitney was in his business experience as
the manager of vast things and knowledge of all their
details. He comes to public duty at the exact time when
the need of such a man is the greatest.- There , is no
difference of opinion about our need of a navy not
second to the combined sea power of any two of the
first-class nations of Europe. That is one policy in
which all parties and all sections concur. The President
has made a happy selection of the man to carry on the
work. He has youth, experience, energy, honor and pa
triotism. The good son of a good father, he has Ameri
can soundness and saneness in every fiber, and the honor
of the navy is safe in his hands. His executive career
should be prolonged.
In the organization of the government under the con
stitution in' 1789 the - Secretary of War had charge of
both the army and navy. In 1798 the navy was made an
independent department. The changes in the secretary
ship of that department have been the most frequent and
the terms of service the shortest of all the Cabinet posi
tions. The only long term Secretary was Gideon Welles
of Connecticut, who went in with Mr. Lincoln in 1861
and remained eight years, giving way' to Adolph Borie
in 1869. In the one hundred and six years since the
creation of the department thirty-six secretaries have
held the office, an average of less than three years each.
We are getting better ideas of the necessity of continuity
of policy in the business of our Government, and it is to
be hoped that we will apply it to the business'of build
ing a navy by keeping Mr. Morton long in a place for
which he is peculiarly fitted
THE CALL has already felicitated California upon
the "prospect of representation in the Cabinet. That
prospect has become a certainty, and the State for
the second time in its history has a representative in the
official council of the President. In Secretary Metcalf
the Pacific Coast will have an. intelligent and painstaking
friend of our commerce and the great interests and great
future of our trade will be promoted by him with indus
try and zeal. In doing this he will be advancing the in
terests of the whole country, for the entire Union has a
stake in the commerce of the Pacific.
By the organic act of his department many important
matters are transferred to it from the Treasury. One of
these is the supervision of the lighting and buoying of
our coasts and harbors. The Call has frequently re
ferred to the insufficiency of these safeguards of deep
water shipping on our whole coast. The trade of the
Pacific must come and go in ships and their danger lies
in approaching the coast and entering its harbors. When
Secretary Metcalf returns here in August, as he intends,
to put his private affairs in order, our people and com
mercial bodies will tender to him public expressions of
gratification at the deserved distinction that has come to
him, and will take occasion to discuss with him the needs
of our coast for the promotion of its commerce.
The other new member of the Cabinet/Mr. Paul Mor
ton, the Secretary of the Navy, is almost a Califorhian.
He was born and reared on a farm in Nebraska. His
father, the late J. Sterling Morton, was one of the most
distinguished men in the country and was one of the
foremost* in the West. He was a pioner in Nebraska,
and that State owes to him a debt for which it fondly
cherishes his great memory. He reared a remarkable
family of Â£Â£wis. Each became great in the line of busi
ness which he selected tojollow. Paul entered the rail
road business in a subordinate capacity in his youth, and
passed rapidly and solely on his merit from one station
to another until he became vice president of the Santa
Fe system and the manager of its vast traffic.
He was an important agency in domesticating that
system in California and bringing it to San Francisco.
Much of his time has been spent here and he knows our
State and people intimately, lie has the finest' business
capacity and ranks among the first experts' in the great
field of railway management in this country that is the
marvel of the world. Americans are accustomed to read
the compliments of European and Asiatic railroad man
agers paid to our American roads. The efficiency and
cheapness of our service, the exact adjustment of every
part of it to every other part and to the enormous traffic
of the country, cause#thcse foreign observers to elevate
our transportation to a place among arts of the .world,
since it is the application to practical affairs of the
principles of science.

lyn became the" borough of Brooklyn, New York the
Borough of Manhattan, above the Harlem River the

will be found quite easy to consolidate the Borough of
Berkelfy and a borough of the intermediate territory
with Oakland as, say, the Borough of Peraltaand the
Borough of Alameda, all under the charter of the city
anl county of Oakland. Each will retain its identity
with its separate borough organization, and all will get
rid of the costly and unnecessary dual government from'
which all saffer now in useless taxation.
We would advise that the discussion of the subject be
addressed to this proposed creation and consolidation of
boroughs into one government. Debate will develop the
legal hindrances, which must be cleared awav. and then
if the game be worth the candle, if the benefit of consoli
dation justify the effort necessary to make straight the
legal path to it, the work can go on aimed at a definite
object.

"Mayor Holtzman, Mr. Griffiths, Mr.
Kern, my neighbors and friends: Your
warm and enthusiastic welcome almost
overwhelms me. I am too poor in
words to express to you the gratitude
I feel for this kindly greeting. It % is
immeasurable. I am not insensible to
the high honor which the Republican
National Convention at Chicago has
conferred. But above and beyond that
I value the neighborly respect and
friendly regard which I have bo long
enjoyed here and which you manifest
so generously to-night.
"This city is very dear to us all. We
have for it a profound affection. Most
of what we have been and what we
are and what we expect to be Is cen
tered here. Its shame is our shame;
Its honor our glory. It is home, and
there Is no sweeter, better word than
this In all the .vast vocabulary of men.

have taken conspicuous place in Amer

high purpose, and we honor their mem
ories : irrespective of our political Â¦ be

"In the perilous hours of our country
There' was another - enthusiastic
demonstration that lasted several min
utes when Senator Fairbanks came
forward to express his appreciation of
the words of welcome. He said:
John W. Kern,, who, like Mayor
Holtzman, Is a Democrat, welcomed
Senator Fairbanks home on behalf of
the Commercial Club and in the inter
ests of the city.
THANKS HIS NEIGHBORS.
Senator Beverldge was cheered
heartily as he arose. After a welcom
ing introduction he said:
"The law of compensation is uni
versal and no honor comes to man
â¢without corresponding duties. In the
arduous work to which my eminent
colleague is called he will have the
hearty good wishes of every man and
woman in Indiana, and we, on our
part, have the knowledge that he will
speak and work for what he believes
to be best for the republic. And in
this he will be merely a type of Amer
icanism, because all of us, of every,
party and of every creed, are hoping
and working in our various ways to
make and keep this nation the noblest
of all the nations of the earth."
The committee representing the Co
lumbia, Marion and Commercial clubs
and the Merchants' Association, which
met the Senator at Lebanon, had care
fully planned the details and the party
rapidly passed through the shouting
throng to carriages in waiting behind
an escort of 500 members of the Ma
rlon Club.
The music of the bands was drowned
In the great wave of welcome that
hurled itself against the buildings as
the procession of fifty carriages
Btarted through the crowded streets.
Up Illinois street, into Washington,
around the Circle and up Merid'an
street to the Senator's home, two miles
away, there were two solid fronts of
humanity. The Senator bowed his
acknowledgments continually.
The warmth of the welcome and the
manifest enthusiasm of the populace
were remarked upon with great pleas
ure by the distinguished visitors ot
the party as they drove through the
streets. Many houses were illumi
nated, flags were displayed and rockets
brilliantly piercing the darkness above
carried In advance the news ; of the
approach of the Senator to his home.
TWENTY THOUSAND IN PARTY.
At Sixteenth and Meridian streets,
near which stands the beautiful Fair
banks home, shaded by great forest
trees and flanked by a spacious lawn,
fully 20.000 persons were awaiting the
party. Cheer followed cheer as the
Senator and Mrs. Fairbanks alighted
and entered their dooryard, in which
a large platform, profusely decorated,
had been erected. Seats had been ar
ranged for the speakers and guests.
Mayor Holtzman first expressed to the
Senator the pride of his neighbors In
their sincere welcome.
Senator Fairbanks reached his
home city at 7:30 o'clock to-night, the
approach of the special train bearing
his party being announced by hun
dreds of steam whistles and by the
ringing of -bells. When the train stop
ped 10,000 persons cheered and waved
a welcome. In front were several
hundred prominent residents of the
city, representing all political parties
end including the Mayor of the city
and Governor of the State.
WELCOMED AT HOME.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., June 25. â
The welcome extended to Senator
Fairbanks to-day by. the people of In
diana on his return home from the
Republican National Convention at
Chicago, where he was nominated for
Vice President, was very flattering and
extremely gratifying to the Senator.
Crowd? were waiting at ajl the
towns where the train was scheduled
to stop and the Vice Presidential can
didate was. given the closest attention
while he was speaking. Senator Fair
banks scarcely referred to politics in
the half dozen speeches he made dur
ing the trip, as persons of all parties
and classes turned out to greet him
and the demonstration in most in
stances was of a non-partisan nature.
The first crowd to meet the Senator
was at Kankakee, Illi Fowler and
Lafayette were the next stopping
places and the Senator made speeches
at -both. At Lebanon Senator Fair
banks left his car and spoke from a
platform erected near the station. 1'he
demonstration here was "in charge of
the Hanna Club. Short stops were
made at Colfax, Zionsvllle, Thorntown
and Whitestown.

"I thank you, and thank you again."
Senator Fairbanks at the close of his
address expressed a desire to meet as
many as possible 'personally and shake
hands with them. This wish he had ex
pressed during the day at the various
stops. For an hour and more following
the speeches people thronged past and
shook hands with both Senator and
Mrs. Fairbanks, Chairman Cortelyou

duced.

Is not only a highly accomplished actress, but also a most attrac-
tive woman. However, neither the brilliance of her intellect nor
undoubted charm of manner -or.ld have raised her to world-wide
eminence and renown if nature had not first endowed her with those
indispensable physical attributes â sparkling eyes, cameo cut like
features, and last but not least a luxurious growth of lustrous bronze
hair enfolding her form, vhen let down, in a veil of glory.
It cannot be repeated too often that a woman can seldom hope
to obtain advancement in the realms of art or society if she is not
blessed with a luxuriant growth of glossy hair. As strength is the
pride cf man so is beauty and beautiful hair -the glory of woman. How
neeessarv it is, therefore, for every woman to care for and to guard her
hair. It is precious to her. Science now provides her with the veg-

have been less severe if he had not
exposed latent hoodlumlsm in court.
While his wife, a meek little woman,
accompanied by a three-year-old boy,
was appealing in a .whisper to the
Judge for leniency, Martlnell shouted
surlily from the dock.
"Here, you speak up or shut up."
"Silence, sir!" commanded the Judge.
"Silence yourself," was the defiant
retort. "I don't allow you or any one

"I'll hand it to you day after to
morrow," said the Judge, who had
been Informed that John's character
was not spotless.
Judge Mogan 'dismissed the charge of
assault with a deadly weapon .which
for several weeks had been registered
against Robert Powell, a colored troop
err The complaining witness, an Afro-
American civilian, testified that'he had
been slashed on the head with a bolo
in the hands of Powell, who found him
enjoying, the company of a mulatto
laundress for whom both gentlemen
had "a feelln'." The evidence showed
that the defendant had not committed
all the battery in the case, as his rival
had wielded a razor. With this ex
tenuating circumstance was combined
an excellent previous character, sworn
to by comrades who had served with
PowelL
Among those whose testimony con
tributed to the dismissal of Priyafe
Powell was Private "Bud" Riddles,
ebony-hued, standing six " feet three,
inches In his stockings and with thirty
years' uninterrupted military service
to his credit. He pronounced Private
Powell a "nefty eoldiah," and added
that Sergeant Ell McCarthy could also
conscientiously heap euloglum upon the
defendant if he were permitted to do
so.
"Well," said the Judge, "we are will-
Ing to give hearing to Sergeant Mc-
Carthy â whoso patronymic, by the way,
suggests Celtic rather than Ethiopian
ancestry. Is he a white gentleman?"
"No, sah," replied Private Riddles;
"Sahgant McCa'thy's as black as they
make 'em."
"And what prevents his coming to
court?" Â«
"He's on gyahd, sah, on gyahd."

yesterday morning when Patrolman

Complaints poured Into the office of
the California Hotel from many rooms
at 2 o'clock yesterday morning and in
vestigation by the night clerk Med' to
the discovery that the slumbers of the
complainants had been disturbed by
the strident tones of V. A. Swan aa he
stood on Bush street and in the Swed
ish tongue conversed with a , mild
mannered compatriot Patrolman
Hems was summoned. As he escorted
Swan to the City Prison he was told
thlnflp in Swedish that he would not
have tamely submitted to had they
been" uttered in English. His ignor
ance of the lingo was bliss , for the
prisoner as well as himself.
As Bandmaster Sousa directs his In
strumentalists so did Swan gesticulate
when he stood before Judge Conlan
and. pronounced his arrest one "of the
outrages of the new century. His arms
swung like the limbs of a windmill and
his gestures made Clerk Jack; Rice,
In , proximity, fidget uneasily. Instead
of defending the conduct that pro
voked the policeman to scoop him in,
he severely arraigned the police sys
tem of this city as a whole and ac
cused . his captor of behavior i utterly
unbecoming his uniform. Much more
he evidently was prepared to say when
the Judge abruptly stopped his oratory
by ordering him .to' appear .for'sen
tence to-morrow. ;
.Mary Taylor, accused of stealing a
skirt from a Market-street dry goods
store, pleaded kleptomania and said
she had recently been confined In the
Uklah Asylum for the Insane. But
further Information concerning her- 1
self Mary would not Impart and Judge
Mogan continued her case to give the
police time to find out something more
about her. She is 30 or thereabouts,
respectably dressed and refined in
speech and -bearing.

: Patrolman J. P. Fogarty arrested
the woman in an apartment house at
Turk and Taylor streets, where she
was consorting with Harry Hynes, a
vaudeville speclallslt out of a Job.
Hynes convinced the court that he was
willing to perform for a moderate sal
ary, but for some reason the managers
did not yearn to book his fact." He,
too, was discharged from custody and
gratuitously advised to change his oc
cupation.
Mary M,oore, arrested for vagrancy,
swooned while Judge Conlan.was in
terrogating her. While on her way to
the witness stand she overheard one
policeman facetiously whisper to an
other that the Supervisors had Just
passed an ordinance establishing a
whipping post for the punishment of
female vagrants, but she did not see
the wink that accompanied the whis
per, nor did she know that the re
mark was uttered specially for her
hearing. So when she ascended the
platform her nerves were all aflutter
and the Judicial" questioning so en.
hanced the trepidation that she sud
denly went Into dreamland. After her
removal to the matron's room the case
was dismissed.
"Take me away," sighed 12-year-old
Digby Hurst to the policeman who
grabbed him, "for I would "rather be in
jail than listening to them cheers and
not seeing the fights."
Judge Fritz sent all the defendants
to answer in the Juvenile court.
Two dozen youths of tender age were
arrested Friday night for violating the
curfew ordinance by loitering around
the entrances to Woodward's Pavilion,
wherein Impresario Alec Greggalns' ag
gregation of amateur boxers were de
lighting an Immense concourse of spec
tators.
Joseph B. Simpson and Harry Barker
were arraigned and Instructed by Judge
Mogan as to their rights under the
charges of impersonating an officer
and of batterv which have been sworn
against them by Madame Russell, mas
seuse, and Madame Violet de Wolfe,
seeress, at 136 Sixth street. According
to the complaint the two men visited
the apartments respectively occupied
by the women and attempted to extort
money by representing themselves to
be peace officers, and when they failed
to obtain the money they assaulted the
complainants. The case will be heard
on July 6.
Shortridge produced affidavits . to
show that Kelly had repeatedly com
mitted perjury in order to be permit
ted to vote at public elections. At
Olympia, Washington Territory. In the
year 1870, the attorney said, Kelly for
mally declared his intention of renounc
ing allegiance to* the Queen of Great
Britain and Ireland, and that same
year he voted as a full-fledged citizen
of the United States, although he was
not legally entitled to do so. Ten years
later he swore that he did not embrace
citizenship until 1879, and two years
thereafter he testified on oath that he
became a citizen in 1370. Subsequently
he repeated these contradictory aver
ments and otherwise pronounced him
self a person whose oath was valueless.
In addition to the alleged perjury by
Kelly, Shortridge hinted, at collusion
between Kelly and Gunther In the brib
ery In question, but Judge Fritz
thought that such collusion had not
been indicated by the evidence.
Edward W. Gunther will answer â¢ in
the Superior Court the charge of at
tempting to bribe a juror In a Chinese
murder case recently on trial before
Judge Lawlor.
When the preliminary examination
was called in Department No. 3 of the
Police Court yesterday the defendant's
attorney, Samuel M. Shortrldge, moved
for dismissal on the ground that the
complaining witness, David Kelly, was
unworthy of credence under oath, but
the motion was denied and the hearing
continued till next Tuesday, when, as
Judge Fritz said, he would hold.Gun
ther to the higher court, with ball fixed
at $5000.

The compensation of the other em
ployes affected by the change in the
'salary roll were adjusted to the stand
ard of those of other mints. This
change necessitated the abolishing of
two positions â those . of memorandum
clerk and transfer clerk. The pay of
all the clerks transferred to the salary
roll was fixed at $1600 per year, which
is the same as that of the minor clerks
already on the salary roll. This is. a
raise of $33 per year. The only other
material reduction was that of the
chief doorkeeper, who suffered a reduc
tion of $277 per year, and the \ other
doorkeepers, who were cut $255 a year.
The compensation of the workmen, or
helpers, who constitute the bulk of , the
employes of the Mint, was not affected
by this order.
George E. Roberts, director., of
mints, arrived from Washington ; last
night and is staying at the Palace. He
said he came here simply on his an
nual tour of inspection and- to partici
pate in the work of counting the "coin
In. the, local' mint. _
Section two of the appropriation bill
fixes the compensation of watchmen,
assistant messengers, firemen and la
borers, which has In the case of the
watchmen reduced their pay $375 per
year, or from $3 per day for each day
in the year to 5720 per year. /The fire
men are reduced from $3 50 per day to
5720 per year, and the laborers from
$2 50 and $3 per day to $GCO per year.
It seems that these are the salaries
that prevail at all other branches of the
Treasury Department, and Congress
has taken the view that all should be
uniform.
i A stir was caused at the United
j States Mint yesterday, when orders
| were received from the Treasury De
partment at Washington reducing the
j wages of many of the employes. It has
j been the custom for many years past
for the salaries of certain employes to
be cut down or their services dispensed
with whenever pressure of work be
j came greater in other branches of the
| Mint. Congress objected to this meth
j od some time since, and the auditor of
the Treasury Department upheld that
body. The local Mint authorities are
therefore compelled to await word from
the national capital in order to change
j the salary schedule. "
The Judge in dismissing the Lou
Sing case EaJd that some men who be
came vested in a llttlÂ«. brief authority
abused that authority, as in the case3
under discussion, and by that means
were more dangerous to the peace of
the community than a whole shipload
of Louie Poys.
Judge Dunne took occasion again
yesterday to criticize the actions of
members of the Police Department
when the case of Lou Sing, charged
ivlth.an assault to commit murder, for
shooting at Louie Poy on Baker alley
on March 29, was called to be dismissed
on motion of the District Attorney.
Lou Lee, charged with ehooting at
Kam Chin at the same place and time.
had been tried abo-ut ten days ago and
the Jury had acquitted him. Several
policemen had testified for the defense
to the effect that the character of the
complaining witness was bad. The
Judge severely reflected upon the offi
cers for bo testifying from what he
deemed .unworthy motives and he com
mented generally upon the consistent
perjury In Chinese cases.
Yesterday Attorney Carpenter said
lie understood that the Judge had
questioned the rood faith of the prose
cution in the Lou Lee case. The law
yer desired to demur to any such criti
cism. ThÂ» Judge assured him that he
had been misinformed as he had never
called In question the good faith of
the prosecution. Attorney Frank G.
Drury for the defense said that the
officers had simply done their duty and
he was prepared to prove by the same
witnesses that Louie Poy was also a
notorious highbinder and ' dangerous
character.

A motion was made, before Judge
Lawlor yesterday for a new trial in
the case of Edward Richards, charged
with murder, but convicted by a jury
of manslaughter. He shot and killed
Joseph Martini, saloon-keeper, 623
Pacific street, on January 6, during a
dispute about the payment for two
bottles of beer.
In connection with the motion af
fidavits were filed by two of the ju
rors who tried the case, Frederick
Stallman and Peter Anthes. Stallman
averred 'that the instructions of the
court were bo long and the Judge
spoke in so low a tone of voice that
he was un&ble to hear the instructions
fully. Peter Anthes averred â¢ that he
only heard part of the instructions
read owing to" the clatter rnaUe by
passing cars and vehicles and the low
tone of the Judge's voice.
Affidavits were also filed by the
other jurors declaring that about
twenty-six ballots were taken, the jury
being divided as to the degree of the
crime, and that the verdict "Sf man
slaughter was * a compromised The
matter was continued for a week.

SALINAS, June 25.â Fearful of the
results of an operation for appendicitis,
the Rev. Charles Montgomery Hoge,
one of the most widely known clergy
men of the State and the Episcopal
minister in charge of the King City
and Jolon districts, committed suicide
by blowing out his brains with a re
volver early this morning: at his home
near New Monterey. The deceased,
who was eccentric in his actions, was
told on Thursday that he would have
to submit to an operation, and it is
thought he became insane brooding
over it. He was a native of Arkansas,
71 years of age.
Dr. Hoge came to this State from
Texas during the early '50's and settled
near Salinas. In 1860 he was ordained
a minister by the "Pacific annual con
ference of the Methodist church South,
and left that denomination in 1863 to
join the" Episcopal church. Some thlrty
flve years ago his wife, who survives
him, became Insane, but since 1ST0 she
hsa been kept at home under, his sur
veillance. She is mildly insane, and the
fear that harm would tome to her also
added to his worry. On leaving the
Methodist church he was the recipient
of commendatory resolutions. He -was
highly respected, and his tragic end has
cast a gloom over the community. The
verdict of the Coroner's jury la that
Dr. Hoge committed suicide while tem
porarily Insane.
Rev. Charles M. Hoge Com
mits Suicide at His
Home Near New Monterey
Dr. Stoll. and Dr. Blake had offices
with Dr. Decker in the Phelan building.
The first two named were wrangling
constantly. On October 16, 1902, an an
gry altercation arose between the two
men, and at the conclusion of the quar
rel Blake had two bullets iA his body.
He died from the effects of his wounds
a few days later and Dr. Stoll was ar
rested on the charge of murder. ..' .
The question on which the court splits
Is whether the plea of twice in jeopardy
should apply in the case at bar. Jus
tices Lorigan, Shaw, Henshaw and Me
Farland agree that the defendant was
not in jeouardy* In, the meaning of the
law. Chief Justice Beatty reserves his
opinion on this question, and Justices
Angellotti'and Van Dyke hold that the
jury verdict is a bar to another trial.
QUARREIi CAUSES SHOOTING.
"The â¢ sole question presented Is
whether the court had au/}iorlty to give
such a direction to the jury. We are
satisfied it had not, and that the order
to that effect Is not only erroneous, but
void." It was erroneous because under
no circumstances is the court author
ized in a criminal case to direct a jury
to return any particular verdict. It
can simply advise them to do so, an
advice which they are not bound to fol
low."
The jury acquitted Dr. Stoll, the Dis
trict Attorney having previously, taken
exceptiop to the ruling. Attorney Gen
eral Webb then appedeld. The Supreme
Court after citing the facts in the case
says:
The Supreme Court has decided that
Dr. Benjamin F. Stoll must again be
tried on the charge of murdering his
former' business associate, Dr. Robert
Blake. Judge Cook's order directing
the jury to return a verdict of acquittal
is reversed. District Attorney Bying
ton' states that he will immediately pro
ceed with the prosecution. Dr. Stoll is
not under bail, but will furnish bonds
when rearrested. The case is unique in
California jurisprudence, in that the
State appealed from. a jury verdict of
acquittal. Two Justices dissent from
the majority opinion, but all agree that
Judge Cook's ruling was erroneous.
When the case had been brought to
trial in the Superior Court Assistant
District Attorney Ashe made the usual
statement of what the prosecution in
tended to show. Hiram Johnson, "Dr.
Stoll's attorney, then moved the court
to acquit the defendant. Judge Cook
instructed the jury as follows:
"Gentlemen, on the admitted facts in
this case, as stated to you by the Dis
trict Attorney and admitted by the
counsel for the .defendant, you have
heard the discussion that has "taken
place here by counsel and the court,
and I direct you to find a verdict for the
defendant, for the reason, in my opin
ion, under the facts of. the case as ad
mitted the homicide admitted to have
taken place was justiable." '

half in :50&, a terrific pace for a slow
track. Colonial Girl still hung on,
running well within herself. Moharib
was third and Sambo. fourth.
At the three-quarter pole Hermis
seemed to have the race at his mercy,
but little Booker, noticing that the
Eastern horse faltered and was tiring,
sent Colonial Girl after him. Redfern
felt his mount tire under him and
struck him twice with the whip as the
St. Louis mare ran up alongside of
him. Hermis shot out into the lead
again, but it was his dying effort.
Colonial Girl was surely and speedily
overhauling him.
COLONIAL GIRL DRAWS AWAY.
As they rounded into the stretch a

Hermis had shot his bolt.

Redfern, on Hermis, was the quickest
to get his mounjt in motion, followed

shot his mount to the outside of the
track, where the going was better, fol

While the elder McConaghy is
strong in the defense of his son before
strangers, he has intimated that this
is the prodigal's last chance.
McConaghy was at one time a promis
ing young attorney, but the desire to
be a "good fellow" overshadowed his
ambitions for a career. He found t!he
red lights and their, associations' glow
more inviting than the midnight oil
'and dry legal lore'. He sold a notary
ship he once held for a song and aban
doned everything for the pursuit of
pleasure.
The rumor that Neil McConaglly
had been Involved in some shady
financial transactions just before his
departure was indignantly denied Jay
McConaghy Sr. yesterday. The father
said: "The story that my son misap
propriated money belonging to me or
to anybody else is absolutely false.
He is still in the State and I know
exactly where to find him."
The young attorney's mother, said:
"My son has wronged nobody. Of
course we know where he is. His
father wrote to him to-day. When
my son returns â we expect him short
ly â he will not be afraid of anybody."
Neil McConaghy, formerly an attor
ney, with an office in the Mills building,
has fled from this city, leaving behind a
small army of bill collectors gnashing
their teeth as they view the sign,
"Away on business," on his office door.
Two of his creditors, H. H. Taylor,
manager of the Mills building, and
Carl Elfving, a money lender, have
locked horns over McConaghy's law
library.
â¢ It seems that the attorney, owing
Elfving $150 on a note and having
against him $125 in back rent for the
Mills building office, had given both
the money lender and the building
agent liens on the books. Then he
left several weeks ago for parts un
certainâfriends say for Placerville.
When the creditors quarreled over
the library, N. McConaghy Sr., father of
the missing lawyer and reputed to be
wealthy, came to the rescue. He set

this week by his masterly work. Al
though the hits were even, the Oak
land pitcher was steady and effective
at critical times, while Keefe was
wild, two of his bases on balls de
veloping into runs. After Schlafley
was passed O. Graham hit for two
sacks and after Nordyke missed a
grounder both scored.
In the fifth Ganley was given a
ticket to first, took second on a wild
pitch and tallied when Schlafley
singled. Tacoma's run was earned on
Sheehan's two-bagger and Nordyke's
single. After that they could not hit
Buchanan to advantage and he was
supported in faultless style. Oscar
Graham made a splendid catch In the
field, while Casey's work was nothing
short of sensational, he spoiling sev

BUCHANAN'S GREAT WORK.
SEATTLE, June 25.vCharlle Hall
pitched a great game this afternoon
against Ban Francisco and scored a
Bhut-out. All the luck was with, the
1 youngster. Every time he got - into a
hole, and he did that on several occa
sions, he either worked out himself or
phenomlnal fielding did the trick for
him. 'Â¦(Â¦/Â¦_
Knell was in good form and had the
sluggers guessing until thÂ«*seventh in
ning, when they lined out two three
baggers, a double and a single. These
hits, combined with Knell's muff of a
difficult pop fly, netted four runs and
cinched the game.
Van Haltren surprised the crowd by
throwing a man out at the home plate,
cutting off the run that seemed abso
lutely safe for San Francisco. Tom
Browne continues to umpire fine ball.

form from a spectator's standpoint,
and many a greyhound was exhausted
trying to run down the fleet-footed
animals. The feature of the day was
the course between Ml Amigo and
Golden Rule. The two dogs chased the
hare for 5 minutes and 60 seconds.
Eight relief dogs were sent to their as

surprise of the day when he defeated

It was at this point the boys on the
leaders began to ride hard. Irish Lad
was ahead, but O'Neill on Ort Wells
began to gain. He was, however, un
able to head off Irish Lad, which pass

Passing the stand the first time,
Irish Lad was leading by a. head from
Delhi, while Ort Wells was third.
The quarter was covered' in 24 seconds.
Making the turn into the back stretch
BLtiCL coming to the half-mile pole, Delhi
took the lead, with Irish Lad second,
a length back. The time to the half
was :48 2-5. Ort Wells was third, with
Bryn Mawr and Highball close up.
Delhi was still leading at the three
quarters, which was covered in 1:13,
Irish I.ad being in second place and
going easily. Ort Wells was third, and
he, too, was going In a good, easy
stride. The mile was covered in 1:33
flat, the fastest mile run In the Bast
this year.
* Hildebrand on Irish Lad at this
point sent his mount to the front? and
as he flashed past the one and a quar
ter pole In 2:08 the game son of Candel
mas-Arrow Crass was a length ahead
of Ort Wells, which had moved up as
Delhi fell back.
NEW YORK, June 25.â Driven to the
limit in the last few strides, the favor
ite. Irish Lad, won the $15,000 Advance
stakes at Sheepshead. Bay to-day, mak
ing a new world's record of 2:17 3-5
for the dfstance, one'and three-eighths
miles. The best previous record, 2:18%,
was made by Sabine in Chicago on
July 5, 1894. Ort Wells was second and
Bryn Mawr third. The crowd in at
tendance was equal to that of j Sub
urban day.
The field that made up the Advance
stakes was one of the best that ever
faced the starter for this rich purse."
Irish Lad was quoted at the good price
of 5 to 2. The Drake-Gates combina
tion bet heavily on Ort Wells, which
closed at 3 to 1. -Bryn Mawr, winner
of the Brooklyn Derby, was quoted at
7 to 2," while The Picket was held at
4 to 1. The horses were sent away to
a good start. Irish Lad was the first
to show, with Delhi second and Ort
Wells third. The Picket was off in
a -good position, but in the rush for
the rail was interfered with, which
probably accounted for his bad race.

EIGHT BELIEF HOUNDS
CHICAGO, June 26. â Despite heavy
showers this morning the track at
Hawthorne was \n fair shape. The at
tendance was light. Port Royal won
the feature race in a drive from Fon
casta. He was pounded down from
6 to 1 to 16 to 5. Ocean Dream led
to the paddock gate, where she took
!the. rail in the worst going. . Port
I Royal and Foncasta then hooked up
in the middle of the track and the two
fought it out to the wire, the Street
horse getting the verdict by a short
neck. Beau Ormonde was a 2 to 1
favorite, but the going was not to hl3
liking. . â¢ :/
A mild killing was made on Rag
Tag in the second event. Opening at
5 to 2, so much money was poured into
the ring on him that 2 to 1 was soon
the best obtainable. Zlbia opened fa
vorite at 2 to 1 and had considerable
backing, but at post time 13 to 5 could
be secured. "Big Bill" Knapp rode
Rag Tag perfectly, getting off in
front, but allowing Zibia to set the
pace until well Into the stretch, finally
winning after a mild drive in the last
sixteenth. Three favorites won. Sum

PHILADELPHIA, Juno 23.â Miss
May Sutton of Pasadena, CaL. won thÂ«
women's tennis championship of tha
United States at Wlssahlckon Heights
to-day by defeating Miss Bessie Moore
in straight sets. 6-1, 6-3. There were)
many people who thought the steadi
ness for which Miss Moore is noted
might gradually wear down the Call
fornlan and enable the New York
player to retain her championship, but
it was not to be.
As in all her other matches, Miss
Sutton gained a pronounced lead at
the start and, continuing her powerful
drives throughout two sets, soon had
Miss Moore chasing to all corners of
her side of the court in a desperate at
tempt to return the ball over thÂ»
net.
Game after game went to the sturdy
Western girl and the only credit to
which Miss Moore could lay claim at
the end was the fact that she won one
more game than any of the others who
had opposed the new phenomenon.
Summary:

Miss Sutton defeated Miss Moore, 6-1,

AGAINST TRULY SHATTUCK
NEW YORK, June 25.â The Toung
Corbett-Jimmy Brttt fight, scheduled to
take place In San Francisco next De
cember, has been Jeopardized by Toung
Corbett.
One of the stipulations in the agree
ment eigned by Harry Pollock, Cor
bett's manager, was that neither of
the principals was to engage in any
contest In the meantime. This is the
clause Corbett has decided to break,
and unless he fights Britt during the
summer he will be seen In the ring
with tome other good man.
As no forfeits were put up when the
articles were bo signed Corbett will lose
nothing by calling off the match. Since
Corbett returned from England he has
been taking things easy along Broad
way, lie is anxious to get back Into
harness and earn a few dollars. Of
course, he would prefer his next match
with Britt, but he cannot wait until
December to accommodate Britt.
The Hayes Valley Club will match
Corbett with the winner of the Nelson-
Hanlon fight If it c$n secure the
Augrust permit.
Under Pollock's construction of the
agreement it rests with Britt to decide
whether he will go on with the match
or not.

I of the wiles of the dog faker is King
Edward. Not long ago his Majesty
bought a dog to which he had taken a
frreat fancy. "When later on he went to
the royal kennels to see his new pet he
was unable to recognize it. The elab
orate results obtained by trimming,
combing and cropping had disappeared,
and the dog stood revealed with all its
bad points. ' ; '
There is a great deal of dissatisfac

is shortly to be approached with a view
to letting It become known when a dog

man, was treated at the Central Emer
gency Hospital last night for a num
ber of scalp wounds and a lacerated
wound of the right cheek. He was
somewhat und^r the influence of liquor
upon arriving at the hospital and de
clared that he had been shot by an un
known man In front of Mlchelson's sta
ble, 844 Geary street. An examination
of Bullard was made by Dr. Boskowitz,
who found no indication of a bullet
wound. Detective Charles Taylor made
an investigation and ascertained that
Bullard, who. was employed by
Michelson as head stableman before
the present strike, walked into the barn
last night In an ; intoxicated condition,
and the employes of the place, , fearing
that he intended to create trouble,
forcibly ejected him.

to be taken a prisoner. This morning
he appeared in the Police Court and
was held over to appear before the Su
perior Court on a charge of grand
larceny. The man gave the name of
Alexander Phin.
Phin says he was hungry. He met
Mr*. Whitney close to her home at
1610 West street last night, snatched
her purse and bolted.. Her cries were
heard by Mr. Quick, â¢ who lives about
a block away in the direction the thief
was taking. Runnmg out of his house
close behind the fleeing man he
threatened to shot him. Then Â¦ Phin
stopped. Quick recovered the purse,
which he gave to; the woman, and
turned the thief over to the police.

His fame, indeed, is said to have
traveled to America and a few days
ago he received a cablegram asking
on what terms he would cross the
Atlantic. Rae would not be tempted.
LONDON, June 25.â London has been
flooded during the week with reports of
the marvelous cures effected by Wil
liam Rae, a Scotch miner living at
Blantyre, a little village near Glasgow.
Special correspondents have written
columns telling how the halt were cured
and the deformed made straight by an
old man whose medical knowledge, was
limited to a few notions of anatomy ob
tained by cursory study of a hand
book. Some of them went so far as to
suggest that Rae's power was superhu
man. His cottage, it was said, pre
sented a remarkable sight. Crowds of
persons, some on crutches, others hob
.bling along with walking sticks, but all
full of hope, besieged the former miner.
One Instance of Rae's methods was
given by a correspondent as follows:
"The patient was a little boy, who
could not walk. Said Rae: 'This is a
case of dislocated hip. The doctors call
it a disease, but it is not.' He made the
boy lie down: then, suddenly seizing
the limb, he gave it a Jerk. There was
a sharp crack, a sharper cry from the
boy and before the latter's mother
cculd recover from her astonishment
her child was walking about the room
delightedly, waving his discarded pa
tent weighted boot in the air." .
There was a dozen of. stories such as
this detailed at length In the" Daily
Mail, the Chronicle, the Express and
several other London newspapers.
Photographs of Rae have been pub
lished, showing him to be a somewhat
uncouth looking mani with a badly
trimmed beard , and heavy features.
His fee never varies. To all alike he
charges half a guinea.-
From every part of England and
Scotland, if one is to believe the ac
counts one reads, people have traveled
to seek Rae's assistance and pay. their
half a guinea. Still Rae is not wealthy,
although It appears he has been carry
ing on his "bloodless surgery" for
years. '

BERKELEY, June 25. â In addition
to its other functions the University

the right to pass upon the quality of
the cooklnsr in local student boarding
houses. It has taken upon itself to
say that fifty-six of these places have
come uj> to the standard and has
given them a "first section" in the
cuisine department. Five others did
not pass the test because the pie or
the soup or something else was not as
good as the label said it should be.
The board of Burvey that acted for
the university in this health food

Reinhardt and Dr. Mary Ritter. This
board went the rounds of the Berkeley
boarding-houses and carried out a

ST. LOUIS, June 25.â The police to
day discovered that a Four Courts
prisoner, Dr. R. "W. Royal Donmeyer,
a young dentist whose personal card
proclaims him a Mystic Shriner and a
thirty-second degree Mason of San
Francisco, had passed stolen diamonds
valued at more than $4000 through the
bars of his cell into his mother's mouth
while kissing her. The mother re
stored the diamonds to their owner,
vainly attempting to persuade the lat
â¢ter not to prosecute.
The plaintiffs are Mr. and Mrs. W. B.
Hays of St. Louis, who were entertain
ing Donmeyer when it is alleged he
stole the diamonds from Mrs. Hays'
Jewel box. At first the Hays did not
suspect Donmeyer, but Chief of De
tective^ Desmond did and accordingly
ordered Donmeyer arrested. A search
of Donmeyer's person failed to reveal
the diamonds, which at that moment
were hidden in a cavity In his mouth
caused by the loss of two rear teeth.
According to Assistant Chief Gillaspy,
Donmoyer's knowledge of dentistry
helped him greatly In the selection of
a hiding place for the diamonds.
The police learned the secret by
"sweating" Donmeyer .to-day, after
Hays had told of the restoration of the
diamonds to him by " Donmeyer's
mother.
JDonmeyer's father and mother ar
rived on Monday from Johnstown, Pa.,
where the name of Donmeyer is highly
respected. Mrs. Donmeyer. pleaded for
a chance to see her son alone. This
permission was refused until Thursday
afternoon. Her son was brought to
her and the guards retired to a re
spectful distance.
Mother and son talked earnestly for
a long while, the mother weeping. The
son arose and took his mother in his
arms. Their lips met in a long and
fervent kiss. The guard, watching
them covertly, felt a sympathetic lump
rise in his throat, but kept hi3 eyes
upon them. The mother turned away
with her handkerchief to her eyes and
her hands covering her face, and pass
ed out of the jail; the son was led back
to his cell.

SEATTLE, June 25.â Joseph Klemer,
a butcher on the steamship Excelsior,
was a raving maniac this morning
when the vessel arrived from Alaska,
all because he thought he saw his
wife's face mirrored in the waters when
he looked over the side of the vessel
four days ago. A believer in super
stitions and omens, this meant to
Klemer that some one was plotting
against the wife he had married in
Seattle six months ago and who was
awaiting his return. He thought that
some enemy was pursuing her and this
enemy he took to be her stepfather.
Being unable to help her, he became a
madman and was put in irons. It re
quired two Jailers to carry him to the
County Jail this morning, where a
medical commission was summoned to
examine him.
The minute that Klemer saw his wife
and that she was not injured, he quiet
ed down and became almost perfectly
sane.
In Valdez, Alaska, lives Mrs. Klem
er's stepfather, and It is said he has
always been trying to make trouble
for the couple. It is declared that when
the mother of Mrs. Klemer died, her
stepfather tried to force her to marry
him, but she ran away. Some months
afterward ghe married Klemer and the
stepfather, according to the story told
by several witnesses, has been pursu
ing the couple ever since.

The Chicago letter of Mitchell. Mulcahy &
Co. said: "Market showed a little strength
early, but met with free offerings, and the
improvement was more than lost. We are In
clined to the view that the holders of Pro
vlslpns would be wise to take profits. In the
first place, we are approaching delivery day
and there is a large scattered long interest.
With liberal local stocks they are pretty apt
to pay full carrying charges Into September.
The advance has been purely speculative, and
on the disappointing receipts of Hogs. There
is nothing very bullish tn the cash situation,
and In respect to Lard is the reverse of bull
ish. Local stocks of Lard are accumulating
rapidly. If there is any shortage of Hogs tn
the country It Is likely to be only in the Â»nar
ketable Hogs and not in the foundations of
supplies for the future. It may be too soon to
take the bear side, but we think it wise to
take profits."

Z.t'r mail aÂ«ivicâ¬Â« from New York say:
"Although complaint is made In some quar
ters that trade is not what it should be even
lor this time of the year, the general rejÂ»ort
Is that there is a fair amount of business,
though tt is on the hand-to-mouth order, and
there is a better feeling in the markÂ« t than
has been noted for Fome time past. This is
largely attributable to the fact that not for
many years have ttock* of all varieties been
to closely clear.ed up at this sÂ»-ason as they
e^e at the present time. Even raisins are not
Jn excessive supply, even for such a <lull mar
ket. Supplies: of Peaches and Apricots are
particularly low here and light everywhere
eise. particularly on the Coast. In ihU mar
ket there is said to bÂ«- but uno holder of a
rtraight car of any prade of peaches. This
oonslsts of extra choice ettx-k and Is held at

place orders for future delivery, but the sea
son is in Its emiy stages and not much ac
tivity In futures is ever looked for Â»o soon
after the opening. The currant market is
fairly firm, but as buyers and sellers are a[>art
In their views little business results. Sultana

Washington Crop .Bulletin.
The report of G. N. Salisbury, section di
rector. United States Weather Bureau, for thÂ«
\\>shington Crop Bulletin, week ended June 21,
Is as fallows:
The week war one of averspr warmth for
the season of the year. On Friday brisk to
bifh northwest winds caused a decided fall in
temperature, anfl Saturday remained cool. Sun
day was somewhat warmer In the afternoon.
The drought that has prevailed for several
weeks cu broken on the 17th by a heavy,
r _*>.::.*.- rain throughout the western counties,
and copious ehowers in most parts of the eaj-t
rm counties. Vegetation had beÂ«run to suffer
from lack of moisture; ganiens and strawber
ries were drying up. The rain was. therefore,
of very great benefit to crops of nil kinds,
except, perhaj*. the hay crop, some of which
waÂ» being cut. In parts of the western coun
ties hirh winds and ' heavy rain lodged the
clover badly. From appearances the hay crop
will not be as heavy as it has been for the
yast two or three years. Timothy is reported
as light, and the alfalfa that has been cut is,
eo far, a light crop.
Although northerly -winds have prevailed
muÂ«-h of the time for two weeks they have not
been hot enough to Injure the wheat, and the
only damage uas on low lands, from the frost
of the 11th inst. Winter wheat continues in
fine condition, and 1* fast approaching ma
turity. Some in the southeast counties has
been cut for hay.. Spring wheat, barley, and
oats are all growing well. Considerable China
lettuce is reported In Lincoln County fields.
Barly potatoes are all in bloom, and late ones
are well up out of the ground. Heavy winds
broke off the arms of hop vines and whipped
them badly: they also blew off considerable
fruit. Royal Anne cherries are beginning to
ripen.

Bank Clearings.
CHICAGO. June 25. â As the result of a va
riety of bullish Influences, a strong tone pre
vailed In wheat at the opening. Th? most
prominent factors were higher cables, de
creased shipments from Australia and addi
tional rain in sections of the Southwest where
. harvesting Is In progress. Initial quotations on
; September were up >4c to %c at 80Â»ic to Sic-
Trading was light during the early part of
â¢ the nession. more from a scarcity of offer-
I inj;3 than from any lack of dfmand. Shorts
and commission-houses were the principal bid
ders. The sellins: was largely by scalpers.
Â¦ As the. Fesslon advanced a considerable amount
of bearish news was received, but it had little
effect, the market retaining its opening firm
ness. On the other hand, tradeis took par
ticular note of all bulish items. Continental
advices told of treat damage to wheat in
Â¦ Caucasia. An estimate on tlie world's ship
ments for the week placed the amount at about
eight million bushels, a low figure compared
I with r<?c<?nt shipments. Apparently the more
influential fHCtor of late trading- was a report
; of a Minneaiiolis croc expert. In referring to
i harvesting operations in the Southwest, this
i authority eelii the milling demand was so ur
' gent that there was little likelihood of anj"
new wheat reaching Chicago during July. The
effect Â«>f this report was to give added Im
i petus to buying. During the last hour S*p
j tember advancfd to Sl*;c on the purchase of
several million bushels by Nufthwestern
houses. There was some reaction from the
top. but tl>e market clos?d strong, with Sep
tember Â«t 81*4c July ranged between 85%o
ami S6Hc and clqsed with a gain of fie at
Â£5Tic.
Heavy Felling of the July option by elevator
interests caused weakness In corn. The
Host was almost at the lowest point of the
day, July l<elnsr down %c at 47?ic, after sell
ins between 47%c Â¦ and 4S%c. September
opfiie.i tio to \' t c bteher at 4M%c to 48%@
4S-^c. sold between 4S(Â£c and 4SÂ»^s and closed
at 4RVi l &4S%c.
The fluctuations In wheat and corn had little
Influence < n tlie oats market, prices holding
*t<arly within a very small range.
After *<elllnff between 4S%<34S%c. July
closed with a loss of Vh@Uc at H8KC Septem
ber opened unchanged to %c@Vic higher at
31-T^c to 31 T ,Â«Â®32c. sold within the opening
range and closed at the low point.
Provisions were firm rarly an smaller re
oeijite nf hogs anil higher prices at the yards.
Packers were fair purchasers early. in the day.
â¢ I^ater in tlie session the market eased oft on
; profit-taking. Prospects of more liberal re
! ceipts of hogs on Monday were a late bear
| Influence. At th? clpa-s September pork was

Chicago Board of Trade.
Trade In fresh fruits was quite active, aa
local dealers were purchasing for two days'
requirements, and a fair inquiry was noted for
good, sound stock for shipment on the Portland
steamer leaving to-day. Despite the, Increased
trading, the market had an easy tone, as sup
plies of most descriptions were still In excess
of the demand, and as usual there was a
heavy surplus unsold at the close. Apricots,
Peaches and Apples were lower and large, buy
ers experienced no difficulty in obtaining sup
plies, at concessions. The canners were etill
in the market for Apricots and paid from $20
to $."15 per ton as to size, color and quality.
Cantaloupes were quoted lower, aa the re- j
cetpts came to hand rather soft and had to be>
sold quickly. Dullness continued to character- I
ize the market for Berries and large lines of
all varieties could be hadtn the afternoon at
or near the minimum quotations. The canners
bought surplus stocks of Mallnda Strawberries

Wheat and Other Grains.
_____ V
WHEAT â The ' foreign markets were firm,
with higher futures. Private cables reported
serious damage to the Â¦ Russian crop.
Chicago was lc higher on the stronger cables
and reports of damage 4n large areas tn Kansas
by wind, bail and rain. The private wires of
Mitchell. Mulcahy & Co. from Chicago said:
'"It was a much more active market and rather
indicates a broadening of speculative Interest.
Cables were sharply higher. Broomhall said
the advance in Liverpool was the result of
large houses buying freely and to a decreas* in
Indian offerings. There were further general
rains throughout the West and Southwest.
Along with the prediction of better weather
there was also the rrediction of light frost in
the Dakotas. All these made a covering- of
shorts and better investment buying. South
west .reports no acceptances of Wheat from
the Interior. A message from Jones from Kan
sas reported damage by rain and hall. There
was a sale of 10,000 bushels No. 1 Northern
to so to mills at U6c. Reports were that cash
Wheat in Baltimore was sharply off. So far
as our markets are concerned. It Is largely a
question of weather. Evld-ently the deprecia
tion In European crops is affecting the specu
lative feeling In European markets. The move
ment of Wheat will in any event be delayed
by the rains, and we are Inclined to think
Wheat may be bought on the reactions for the
time being. We doubt, however, if any great
damage has been done so far. Nebraska re
ports pome complaints of rust."
There was no change in the local situation
boyoni an advance in the December option.
The cash grain was quiet.

BARLEYâ Of the heavy receipts of 19,505
ctl* yesterday 10,454 had been sold to a local
mill prior to arrival, and consequently did not
come on the market. The arrival of such a
large quantity, however, depressed .futures and
the market closed weak. Ths cash grain was
also lower and trade was quiet. The demand"

Stray dogs may be impounded, at the
expense " of Â¦ the , owner, â¢ and (if not
claimed .within five; clear days may be
destroyed. - Â¦ .'.-,; .
The act Is intended to apply also to
Scotland and Ireland, and to, come into
operation in 1905.
The curfew regulation empowers .the
Board of Agriculture to make orders
"for preventing dogs from straying
during all or any of the hours between
sunset and sunrise."
Hitherto, in order to be successful In
an action for damage done, by a dog, It
has been necessary to prove a previous
mischievous propensity in the animal.
The first clause of the new bill recites
that "tho owner of a dog shall be liable
in damages for injury done to any cat
tle by that dog; and it shall not be
necessary to show a previous mis
chievous propensity in the dog, or the
owner's knowledge of such propensity,
or to show Â»that the mjury was at
tributable to neglect on the part of the
owner."
A dog proved to have chased or in
jured cattle may be dealt with' as a
dangerous dog under section two of the
act of 1871. v
Dogs in Great Britain, If they only
knew It, have much reason to fear, a
bill introduced In Parliament by Mr.
Fellowes, a lord of the treasury; Walter
Long, president of the local government
board, and the solicitor general. ;
The dog bill is apparently designed
to lessen the damage done by^dogs in
the worrying of cattle, and- this" it pro
poses to do by instituting a kind of
curfew for dogs, and by robbing them
of the time-honored privilege of Vflrst
bite." .
New Government Bill Aims to Abolish
. the Silly "First Bite"
Doctrine.

Mr. Lewis enlisted at Albany, May
27, 1861, in Captain Charles Riley*s
Company F 'of , the famous Thirty
fourth Â£ Regiment, commanded by
James A. Suiter. Lewis went through
the Peninsula campaign without a
scratch until the bloody battle at An
tietam, when he was shot five times,
twice In the legs and once in the face.
He was left on the field for dead and
for two days and nights lay out In the
open, suffering untold agonies, and
should Lewis live to be 100 years old
he will never forget the hours spent
on that battlefield. He was among the
dead reported September 17, 1862, and
his body was supposed to have been
removed from the battlefield and
placed in grave No. 844 in the Na
tional Cemetery at Sharpsburg. Md..

Instead, however, . Lewis was re
moved to a shed, where he remained
a prisoner for seven days, when he
was exchanged and transferred to
Washington, being honorably dis
charged for surgical disability March
22, 1863. 'The wound in the face was
a peculiar one and never since he was
shot has he been able to open his
mouth wide.
In 1868, when he made application
for a pension, Mr. Lewis was promptly
informed by the Pension Department
at Washington that he was killed at
the battle of Antletam and that there
was no such man as William H. Lewis,
a member of Company F, Thiry-fourth
Regiment. He had no trouble in se
curing affidavits from " his captain,
Charles Rlley, and his colonel, James
A; Suiter, establishing his identity and
his pension was soon forthcoming.
Lewis enlisted at 23 years of age and
is now 66. â Herkimer Citizen.

GALVESTON, Texas, June 25.â Miss
Ida B. Criswell, a pretty belle of Denl
sori, died at her home last night as the
result of taking a dose of patent chill
tonic. Soon after taking the medicine
she was seized with convulsions. Two
physicians were summoned and they
worked for hours in a vain effort to
save the : sufferer's life. The doctors
pronounce her death due to the effects
of strychnine and arsenic contained in
the alleged tonic.

WASHINGTON, June 25.â A fraud
order was this morning issued against
"Professor" George Ruppert of Boston
and the "American College of Astrol
ogy."
"Professor" Ruppert is believed to
have obtained* $10,000 or $15,000 by
means of an unscrupulous wit and the
stars and moon in less than two years.
He advertised his alleged knowledge of
the occult extensively and his circulars
are alleged to have been masterpieces
of the swindlers' art. In one he said:
"For $1 I will give you a complete
horoscope of your whole life, written
in accordance to the different position
of the moon and the planets at the
time of your birth."

FRAUD ORDER AGAINST

NEW YORK, June 25. â Philip Wald
helmer, associated with the lawyers
defending "Nan" Patterson, has re
ceived a letter from the chorus girl's
brother-in-law, J. Morgan Smith, who
disappeared several weeks ago.
Smith says he was not the man
who, acompanled by a woman, went
into Hyman Stern's pawnshop on Sixth
avenue the day before the shooting
and purchased the revolver which was
found in Young's pocket. He will tell
where he was on the day the pistol
was purchased and prove it by those
who saw him, he says, when he ap
pears on the stand to help clear his
sister-in-law.
After the receipt of the letter the
lawyer took it to the Tombs and
showed It to "Nan" Patterson, who
was overjoyed. i-t'J

Turning to more convivial lays, the
first which occur to the mind are the
companion songs, "We Won't Go Home
Till Morning" and "For He's a Jolly
Good Fellow," which own a tune In
common. With reference to the words
of the latter, they certainly run into
something that may by courtesy be"
termed a couplet, but of "We Won't
Go Home Till Morning" nothing, ap
parently, has survived beyond the two
lines thej singer's 'Â¦ disinclin
ation to seek repose. Whether a match
less epic has been lost to the world or
whether the poet's inspiration gave out
after the one immortal statement his
tory sayeth not. At any rate, the ac
cumulated archives of the British Mu
seum can yield no information on the
question, so, failing this, the words of
these two most Jovial ditties must per
force be classed \ogether as "tradi
tional." The tune, on the contrary, is a
case In point of English adaptability,? or
as most people know it primarily ap
pertained to ; "Halbrook s'en ya t'en
guerre"â verses not only "made in
France," but containing distinctly anti-
English sentiments. Both - words .. and
music were composed during the great
Duke of Marlborough's campaign, but
the date is not positively known. One
authority indeed asserts that it can be
assigned to this night after the battle
of Malplaquet, but this somehow does
not carry conviction... Hungry soldiers,

HE'S A JOLLY. GOOD FELLOW.
To the modern verses is attached a
romance emanating from the days of
hoops and patches. The hero. of this,
Robin Adairr a good-looLing young
Irish surgeon, once chanced to be of
service to an elderly titled dame who
ha dmer with "an accident near Holy
head. More frightened than hurt, the
lady, when matters were adjusted, pre
sented her deliverer with a Zee of a
hundred guineas and insisted on his
escorting her back to London. Arrived
there, he was forthwith made free of
his patroness' house, and, sad to say,
so far forgot his position as to set his
alte<rtlons on one of the visitors, who
was by no means backward In respond
ing. ' Without further ado the fascinat
ing medico was banished, but the mis
chief was done, his high-born inamo
rata refusing to even look at her other
suitors. As a last expedient she was
taken to Bath to try what a course of
gayety, combined with unpleasant
mineral waters, could effect. Here,
however, Instead of forgetting her lov
er of low degree, the enamored maiden
wrote or induced some one to write
the lines eulogizing her adored Robin
Adair. To make a long story short,
the two were ultimately married, but
their happiness was of brief duration,
for the young wife speedily_fell a vic
tim to consumption, leaving her hus
band bound by a vow to wear perpet-"
ual mourning in memory of their love.
STORY OP THE SONG.
Another melody supposed to.Â»date
from that period is "Robin Adair."
Though, for some mysterious reason
generally included in collections of
Scotch airs, the tune originally came
from Irelandâ where ' it was called
"Eileen Aroon"â the "Scotch snap" on
the words "Robin Adair" being a nine
teenth century addition. The tradition
has it that a chieftain of the clan
O'Daly, like Romeo, fell in i love with
the daughter of his race's hereditary
foe. As is customary in romances, the
lady was competed to marry an unwel
come wooer, but this only made her
lever's opportunity. Disguised as a
harper he appeared at the wedding
feast, where he sang a doleful lay of
love and woe. Then, \ suspicion being
lulled, he suddenly swung the bride on
his horse and, leaping the castle moat,
carried her off before the eyes of his
rival. In remembrance of this the
pseudo-minstrel's melody was treas
ured bv his descendants. At least the
air "Eileen Aroon" is known to have
been the work of one Gerald O'Daly,
a harper of later times, who probably
utilized the ancestral tune. .
To a certain extent the English are
cosmopolitan in their musical tastes.
That is to say, they are always, ready
to adopt the songs and tunes of other
nations, provided only the melody be
pleasing in their ears. Hence possibly
the varied and heterogeneous types of
many of our best-known ballads. Most
of 'these, it is true, took their rise In
other parts of the kingdom; still, the
difference between Celtic, Cymric and
Saxon temperaments is enough to ac
count for much that is otherwise inex
plicable in some of the so-called na
tional songs. Yet even among the3e
we find exceptions. "The British' Gren
adiers," for instance, like its name, is
English to the backbone, and is, fur
thermore, one of the \ oldest popular
songs we have. The' words, it Is evi
dent, were written somewhere between
1C78, when the Grenadier Company was
first formed, and the time of Queen
Anne, in whose reign the regiment
ceased to carry hand grenades. The
tune, from all accounts, is considerably
older, and may even belong to Good
Queen Bess' days, though this, of
course, is merely surmise.

"Mr. Hare and Mr. Fox had apart

The jokes which appear in the al

with comic pictures, most of which
are highly exaggerated caricatures.
Some of the jokes, humorous remarks,

In the almanac for 1S04 quite a large
space is devoted to "original Jokes, wit
ty remarks and humorous anecdotes."
Some of the Jokes found in this number
are still answering, and have appeared
in recent humorous publications as
original. The jokes are not accompa
nied by any key or chart, but so as to
make the humor of the Joke readily ap
parent to the reader they are all pub
lished under the headings of "humor"
and the parts of the anecdotes sup
posed to be funny were printed in ital

thought exceptionally good were print
ed under the head "Very Funny."
There is nothing to indicate the au
thorship of any of the jokes. Some of
the "very funny" jokes which appear in
the almanac of 1804 were as follows:

"WASHINGTON, June 25.â Fat men
and men not indicating sufficient inter
est in' horses are to be barred out of the
cavalry. If the assignments of West
Point cadets this year are to be taken
as a criterion.
In making the assignments this year
a new policy was adopted. Inspector
General Burton recently made an Inter
esting report' to the Secretary, In which
he urgently recommended that the se
lection of cadets for the cavalry arm
of the service be made with the great
est care. He said that fat men or men
who had not shown any particular
fondness for horses during their four
years at West Point should not be as
signed to the cavalry, no matter wheth
er they graduated sufficiently high or
not.
Hitherto It has been the policy of the
War Department to give cadets who
were graduated with high marks their
choice '.between the cavalry and Infan
try arms of the service. In the future
no cadets who are over a certain weight
will be sent to the nor will
those men who have shown at West
Point a timidity in horsemanship be
assigned to the mounted branch of the
army.

NEW YORK, June 25.â The Financier
this week says:
, The striking features of the official
statement of the New York Associated
Banks lust week were more or less im
portant increases in all the . Items ex
cepT surplus reserve, which decreased
only slightly. The loans are now with
in 512.115J400 of the highest ever re
ported, which was on May 14. The
deposits are the greatest on record,
exceeding by 511,601,300 the maximum
shown on May 7, and the specie, legal
tenders and. total cash are the highest
for the current year. Loans were in
creased last week by 517,123,400, a gain
of 530,248,000 since June 4. The week*s
Increase was doubtless largely the re
sult of negotiations of corporation
loans. The near approach of â¢ the July
dividend period also affected the ' loan
operations. The total bt : these pay
ments this week. will aggregate about
5137,000,000. The cash reserve rose 54,
0S6.200 or about 14-5 millions less than
the arilbunt which was elected upon
the, basis of the. traceable movement
of money during the week. The state
ment, so far as ret "ds cash, was prob
ably made on rising averages, the gains
having * been i largest after the middle
of the week. Deposits were Increased
by ; 521,301,600." making a gain - of 544,

week, it will be noted, was less by 5730,
000 than the sum of the gain In 1 loans

tings was brought out in a complaint
filed yesterday in the Superior Court
by /Charles Ehman & Co. of Chicago
against the Pattosien Company of this

Eaid to remain unpaidon a contract
of 56543 for an order of 200 oakwood
and sixty imitation mahograny mantels.
It is alleged that the local firm knew
when it made the order that the plain
tiff would have . to manufacture the
mantels, but "after receiving part of
them the Pattosien Company entered
into an agreement with P. H. Mc-
Carthy and the San Francisco Build
ing Trades Council not to sell any of
the plaintiff's mantels in this State be
cause they had been declared unfair

"If a lower tax rate, based on an in

the revenue which your honorable
board has decided upon I respectfully
eubmit that our taxpayers should Hae
given the benefit of this lower tax rate.
Taxes this year are going to be largely
increased, and to this increase there
should not be added the additional bur
den of taxes, which if levied will mere
ly form a surplus revenue, which must
lie in the city treasury unused during
the ensuing fiscal year. I do not be
lieve that the majority of our taxpay
ers will object to the increase in their
taxes, which increase your honorable
board has so Justly devoted to neces
sary public improvements, amounting
to the sum of over 5500,000. I do believe,

of taxation.

â¢'SAN FRANCISCO. June 25. 1904.
â¢To the Honorable Board of Super
visors of the City and County of San
Franciscoâ Gentlemen: While I am as
yet unable to determine the exact
amount of the assessment roll for this
year, I have in the last few days been
able to estimate approximately what it
will be. From these computations I feel
Eafe In giving you the assurance that
you may estimate the city's revenue
for the current year on the basis of a
roll of 5500.000.000. rather than on a roll
of 54G5.OO0.OO0. This additional increase
in the roll would result in a decrease
of the tax rate amounting to approxi
mately 8 cents, giving to taxpayers the
extremely low rate of 92 cents on. the
5100 in lieu of the dollar limit I am
advised that it is within your power
to change the tax rate previously es
tablished, which was adopted for pur
poses of computation only in order to
provide the revenue made necessary by
the tax budget, which latter has, how
ever, been definitely fixed. " â¢ ;-
Accessor Dodge sent a communication
yesterday to the Board of Supervisors
in which he gives assurance that the
city** revenue for the next fiscal year
ir.ay be estimated on the basis of a
roll of more than J500.000.000. This
makes possible a lower city tax rate
than originally contemplated.
This announcement haa already beÂ«n
outlined in The Call, and In all likeli
hood when the full returns are all in
the roll will aggregate an amount ap
proximating $515,000,000.
Assessor Dodge urges that a lower
tax rate than that of 3L2053, proposed
on an estimated roll of $465,000,000, be
adopted by the Board of Supervisors.
The board will therefore reduce the
rate to JL125G6 at to-morrow's meeting,
making lt 93 cents for running ex
penses. 7 cents for parks and 12.566
cents for Interest and sinking fund on
bonds. Dodgre's letter follows:
