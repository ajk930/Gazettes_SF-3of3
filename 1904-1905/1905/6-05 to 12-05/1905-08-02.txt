LONDON. Avar. 1. â A seven-column
article written by Count Tolstoy ap
peared in the Times this morning, en
titled **A Great Iniquity." It deals with
thÂ« land question and declares that
Russia is living through an Important
tim 9 that > Is destined to h&va enormous
results.
o The article Is largely dsvoted to taÂ«
theories of Henry George and declares
that the land Question has now reached "
a state of ripeness such as fifty years
ago was reached by the question of
"serfdom; that Henry George was right
and that the removal of the sin of land
ed property is near.
o The movement for the liberation o*
mankind, says Count Tolstoy. Is to be
effected by thÂ« Russian Slavonic people,
whp believe- their spiritual and eco
nomic character are predestined for the
great universal task.
Â«ln conclusion. Â°whilo maintaining that
Henry George perfected tho only prac
ticable peaceful solution of the prob
lem. /Tolstoy predicts that - it will be*
solved by the Russian people, not by
Imitation of European and American
proletarianism. but by abolishing land
ed property, thus showing the other na
tions the way to a rational, free and
happy life. .

half of Commander Young that that offi
cer not only wan aware Â»of the weakened
condition" of the Bennington's boilers, but
had more than once advised higher au
thority. On 0 the evening before the ex
plosion he had.^upbn the receipt, of 'rush
orders ta proceed to Port Harf ord to as

OneÂ° Of the: most important statements
to^be forwarded to Washington in the
court's* findings ,1s that the heavy'one
inch steel bolts which rivet the e cfown
sheet to the boiler shell snapped "off as
cleanly as though, they had been or
bitten. eS Theo bolts, through too long use,
had become; crystallized, brittle, burned
out, lifeless and -Incapable of- withstand
ing even^an ordinary strain. Tests here
of- the tensile strength remaining in them
have proved this and this is one of the
facts which the court is now most Jeal
ously-guarding. The condition of these
bolts meant life or death to the crew. \u25a0 ;
It Is more than hinted that the findings
of the : .court, when forwarded to the-Sec
retary "of the oNavy, \u25a0 will ; contain \ recom

connection^ with the court. itself. It" be
came known- ;t6-night .what in substance
'will'be'- the" report" of the of; in-
Qulry; now -investigating tlie Benfiing
ton disaster^ . I
Â» It nuij- be Mtnted authoritatively that
the court will- find that boiler *'B" of
the IlcunitiKt'in exploded not because of
nnuKually high pressure, but
the oaetal.of the crown. sheet and the
bolts holding that cronvn c sheet in place
had become ""dead," had lo.it nil life
ond nearly nil tensile strength by rea
son of eÂ»Â»nÂ«Â«(iiiit tiair and the failure of
those responsible to renew the weak
ened place "during . the twenty years
that the ill-fated Bennlngton . was In
service. " The court wlll c not censure
the officer* of the B.ennfngton, but will
pans up the matter and thr responsibil
ity to higher authority, and it will be
for the - heads of certain bureaus' at
-Washington to explain how the acci
dent happened. o c Â°
Under a pressure of'loo poundscor less,
the crown sheet^of boiler "'B," its sup
ports weakened, and, robbed of "their .ten
sile strength by the crystallization- of the
metal, parted at both ends and dropped,
letting the water and steanudirectlyiinto
the firebox. -This is what the members of
the court of inquiry found this afternoon
after a careful examination of the. wreck
ed boilers. This accounts for ,the terrific
explosion and for the fact that the fire
and ashes were "blown, aft through the
fire rooms. So fierce was ; the force of the
explosion that fire, ashes and live steam
were 'blown "to nearly all parts of the
vessel through the hatches and* ventila
tors. Boiler "D" did not explode, al
though" the. other, boiler was driven
against it. : . 'Â» "' ' cC Â° â =\u25a0 o Â° o ?
The court lias established the further
important fact "that, at e the timeVpf the
explosion the "boiler which exploded was
under lower steam pressure than^ any of
the other boilers. It had been ' filled last
and was fired Â«last and could not' have
raised sufficient steam to cause the ex
plosion-except for the defective parts.

be available. â¢ . â¢ .. .
The Ruefters in the Thirty-eighth As
sembly District are demoralized. They
placed at the- head of their ticket the
name of, P. A. Bergerot. The gangsters
had no more right to use Mr. Bergerot's
name in , the Thirty-eighth than they
had to ,xiae the name' of Colonel Kirk-v
partxick in the Twenty-eighth.- In each
case a fraudulent effort was made to
identify a prominent- citizen" with a bad
cause. The following expression from
Mr. Bergerot is timely: .

apprised 'through the public press 'from day to
day of Â»he work done by the officers of the ae
soctatlun at Washington. As a.result of their
charges, the unreliability of the Veports of the
Department of Agriculture relating to' the oot-.
ton crop ha? been, fully disclosed, and the â¢mal
administration of" that ; department under its
present head had been rpaae evident. â¢ â¢
Following these exposureÂ« efforts are. now
being? .made to, divert public attention" from
the main Issue, which Is the Imperfections of
the department, toward an attempted prose
cution of anybody who can be found as a
scapegoat. Their punishment, even If It Is ac
complished, is of secondary Importance as com
pared j with the reformation of the eystem
which has made their perrormances possible,
and-the purpose' of this address is to secure the
co-operation of the members of this assoolatlon
in influencing. 'ln "every legitimate wny a
reformation of the eystem and a reorganization
of the department. ;
The membership of 'this association, num
bering nearly one million, includes the .pro
ducers of the .most valuable product of Ameri
can agriculture. The cotton crop- of 'the United
States and Its by-products is .worth between
$uqt),oqo,tfoO and J7U0,000,000 annually. It fur
nishes'two-thirds of. our annual trade balance
and In its production and' manufacture employe
many million individuals. No other' product
of the United States Is or greater or of equal
Importance.
.The .practical 'monop-oly of cotton which
America enjoys and Jhe narrow balance |whlch'
has existed for years \u25a0 between sufficiency and
scarcity in .the world's cotton supply rentier
the cotton market peculiarly and acutely 'sus
ceptible to the reports or the Department of
Agriculture regarding the condition -and pros
pects of the cotton" crop. " Under the present
circumstances a great duty devolves upon the
members of the association. We are less con
cerned with what has been done by a few Indi
viduals and the consequences" thereof, remark
able aa they may be, than with* such reforma
tion of departmental methods as shall secure
for us Just and accurate reports In future. â¢In
the system at â¢ present in vogue, and which,
promises to be undisturbed unless public at
tention ehall be aroused to need of reform, the
reports- issued by the. .Department of. Agricul
ture are, in their lost analysis, slrnply'the In
dividual opinion of a few orncials of doubtful
experience and honor, â¢ by wnlch the valuo of
the cotton crop m,ay be and has-b een affected
as much as $75,000,000 In n. single day. ...
No such power should be delegated, to any
Individual or statistical board 'except under
conditions which guarantee the most incorrupt-,
ibis, expert and intelligent, opinion arrived at
by the, application of the most scientific meth
ods and safeguarded by the most scientific pre
cautions. It" Is, therefore., urgently, recom
mended to the members of the' Southern Cot
toniAssociation that,- througn their representa
tives, in Congress and by every, other, mean*
available to. them,- they exert . their, lnflfcence
and that of the association toward securing the

j would throw light upon the Cook af
j fair and there is sl belief that' if he
\u25a0 got information about other crimes he
! must have - been told something that
, boars upon the assault of a week ago

But thfe Sheriff refuses to say any
thing about the Cook assault, and con

that he at last has something definite
upon which to hold Pembroke arid
Crbwhurst. What he learned about the
j most important assault will have to de
l'velop later. Sheriff Barnet, assisted by

I entire day - sweating out the four
.suspects, and from early morning until
I late to-night the. boys were examined
j singly and collectively, until, from a
I mass of contradictory statements a
little that was definite was secured,
i According to the Sheriff, Crowhurst

I the talking. '. .

[ broke down, and he admitted that he

! Crowhurst was one of the .men in the

I the story of an attempt to rob Frank

j Blaker made the plan, but Pembroke
[ *?aia that he refused to go into it be
! cause a sister of Barker had married

Police Captain Spillane waxed so wroth
of epeech and demeanor In the court of
Judge Fritz as to create something of a
sensation. His anger was provoked by
intimation to the effect that malicious ru
mor assailed his official probity/^
' Charles Hamilton, .keeper of a Third
street cigar store, and 'about a dozen
young men, were arrested and accused of
playing, craps', but the patrolman failed
to produce \u25a0 evidence sufficient to warrant
their conviction. Tho Judge, in dismiss
ing the cases, Â« remarked -that he, had no
doubt of the defendants' guilt, and hoped
the police would continue raiding the al
leged cltfbroom *In * Mr. Hamilton's store
and arresting Its -inmates until gambling
therein would be- considered too haz
ardous to be profitable. 'Twas then Cap
tain Sp.Hlane's wrath exploded.,
"We will continue raiding ; the place,"
he Bald, excitedly) "and I'll 6how that
gambling cannot' be carried on in that
district so long as I'm its captain. I'm
an old "man, now, and my .record is clean.

Hamilton with ari expression which
that, gentleman plainly did not relish.
The "Judge, hastened*, to assure Cap
talii Splllane Chat his Integrity was not'
'questioned by -any one connect\d with
the" Court," and the captain bowed ac
knowledgment of the assurance. In
quiry developed,' tha information that
some .person or persons affected by the
ralfl of the Hamilton premises had told
*ome other person or person's, who had
conveyed tbe tale to some other person
or persons, that Captain Splllane was
in receipt of $300 a; month.as remuner
ation for hi& "letting things alone," and
for that reason there was no danger
of ihe -arresting policeman 'presenting

The story of the exploits of a- number
of sure thing men who have been in
\u25a0â¢ Portland and were In St. Louis last
year has gone the rounds, and the al
cohol is to be used in testing diamonds.
. Some ten .days ago parties visited sev
eral Saii Francisco pawnshops and of
fered "blue diamonds" for sale. -The
gems were mounted and had a hand
some look. From their angles, viewed
\u25a0 from any point, a soft blue light was
diffused. The oldest men in the pawn
broking business had heard of blue
diamonds before and so were not eas
ily caught. , One woman on Third
Btreet and possibly others were .'less
fortunate. . â¢
1 A real blue diamond of gofcd size iÂ«
worth a good sum of money. Such a
Stxa Is soxnewjiat rare and is prized ao
cordinjly. Every one in the business
knows this. But when the blueness la
produced by* a clever and concealed ap
plication, of aniline dye there is a dif
ference. The story Is that blue dia
monds were sold to San Francisco
dealers and that, after they had given
'up good gold for the gems, the dealers
found, tuat they were out and injured.
.Business principles prevented making
tti6. facts known, but did not prevent
.the truth from leaking out after a

the 'dye very quickly from, a diamond.

tenced by Judge Cook yesterday to be
hanged at Ban Quentin on October 6.
This la the second, time the death sen
tence has been passed upon Woods. An
appeal to the Supreme jCourt stopped
the execution nxed for January 21,
1908. . . \ ' \u25a0 ' \u25a0- â¢\u25a0
When . the Judge asked "Woods if hie
had anything to say. -why. sentence
should not be pronounced upon, him,
he said: ;.\u25a0\u25a0 * ' â¢ . \u25a0.
"The decision of the Supreme. Court
Is not a just decision. It .la most rot
ten In my opinion. I did not "get. a fair
trial and the newspapers -were hound
ing me. They are rotten. Who is the
worst, Jme or Henderson? I -am not
afraid to die or anything like that,* but
I did not get a square deal. Henderson
told- you that he lied about mo and
wrote you two letters telling you .that
he had lied. Could you believe that
man?"
"The Jury found you guilty," said the
Judge. *
"'Why shouldn't they?" replied Woods.
"They get $2 a day for 1L"
"The evidence showed that y,ou flred
the shot," asserted the Judge. . â¢
"It don't show anything of the kind,"
retorted Woods.
Judge Cook put an end to the discus-"
sion and pronounced sentence of death
upon Woods, who stood- up with a
dogged look on his face".
. District Attorney Byington and his
assistant, Porter Ashe, complimented"
Attorney Al Wheelan, who represented
the defendant, for the manner in which
he conducted the defense and the Judge
added a word of praise. .'. V â¢ =
William Henderson,' -who turned
State's evidence against Woods aqd the
four other defendants, has been out on
probation for some months and the.
charge against him was placed op ihe
reserve calendar. The probation order,
was modified so that he could leave the
State -and go to his home in Montreal.
If he does not leave the. State before
September 1 he will be arrested an-d
brought to .trial. An effort was made
to- Induce the court to make an order
p.aylng Henderson's transportation to
Montreal, but. the Judge said he had
no. power to make such an. order.
Woods was taken to San Quentin
yesterday afternoon. He is a victim of.
consumption .and the County Jail 'au-'
thorities were anxious to get rid of

Great schpols of deep-sea fish dashing
at torpedo"-boat speed .through the surf
and far up on the beach are delighting
and astonishing 'long-shore folk near this
place, says" the Sayville (L. I.), corre
spondent of the^New York Times. The 'fish
are from one to two feet lpng and of a
variety seldom seen in shoal water. Their
action indicates that they are fleeing
from some peril of the ocean. Old sailors
declare that the advent of the fish indi
cates an impending volcanic disturbance
of the ocean's bed, and that the creatures
have, felt its "first warning shock. In the
meantime natives are salting the fish
â¢down by tons.

HERE. are' man's four views pf time:
"You still have forty years ta live","
said the* goardian spirit â¢ to the
youth., \ â¢ â¢ , .
. . "It is a .long, long time." the youth
rep.lied, "and I will do a great deal be
fore it is past." " . . . "â¢
"You ha*vc thirty 'years yat.- to live,"
the guardian* spirit "said to the stiH
young man. \u25a0 . Â» â¢ \u25a0' '
"Well, that is fluite'a while," was the
reply. "Probably I cannot do all i
'had intended, but I will make- quite a
showing." ' ' * â¢
. "Ypu have twenty years .to live.." the
-spirit 'said to th.c ' middle.-aged man.. â¢
"Only twenty!*,. Well, I suppose I will
have to do 'the best I can In that length
of time." " ;'-â¢â¢
For the last time tire .guardian! spirit
appeared. "You. yet have J ten years
left," he said to the rapidly aging man.*
The man sigtied. "But ten years,"
he whispered in reply, "arid what can
one do in those few days!" ." " .
And when the 'end had come the man
looked' backward and moaned. /;i am
.leaving it nearl* all undone!"

ONE YEAR AGCX
THE Russian and Japanese commissioners are nfa.king ready to
parley at Portsmouth for peace 1 .-. The Czar has called on the
Kaiser to tell of his sad plight and get advice. The famed
Baltic fleet is at the bottom of the sea of Japan', except such ships as
Japan took alive and those interned at Manila., A year ago.it was
different. The Vladivostok fleet raided the coasts of Japan, shot
to death the great British merchant "ship Knight Commander, and
captured two other merchantmen and took them. into. Vladivostok,
getting much flour and other- stores. -. .'**.-, *
The sinking of defenseless merchant ships disturbed the world.
No one could recall such an act by. any â¢ Government whose navy
had a home port to which prizes could -be sent. ' During- our Civil
War the Confederate cruisers Alabama and Shenandoah destroyed
our merchant fleet at sea, haVingasari excuse. that there was no
port in the world to which prizes could be sent, and as they were
seizing our ships as an act of war, a stern necessity required their
destruction. \Ve looked upon this as' piracy,' and the Confederay
threw John Paul Jones ; at us, citing his scourging the English coast
and gathering, the enormous fortune that supported him in Paris,
from the spoils of British merchantmen. â¢ \u25a0 ' â¢
"â¢'\u25a0â¢' So,, after all, it. is : the point of view. ' But no point of view
'seemed to justify Russia in sinking merchant ships within a few
hours' sail of a port! When trie Russian admiral returned to Vladi
vostok and set. up the beer for his crews, and had- a celebration over
:hii- achievements, merchant skippers on many -a 'ship, gritted their
\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0 "/"This raid; one year ago. even raised doubts about Japan's mas
\u25a0terv â¢'of the" Eastern seas. True, Kuropatkin had just" lost New

jtiint- of. the-r examination that Mayhew
I hid- given out -the papers. He stated that
|at the examination, when Dr. Mayhew
.'appeared on the stage before the stu-
I. dents.- he "(Dr. Mayhew) had received
! rounds of applause. When questioned fur
:j"th"erby Att9rney Braun, Dr. Cool said
I that he- had' rjeceived applause, but not
until "the last day of the examinations.
J.He, however, put a" stop toHhe applause
'. \ by -raising his- hand. He. admitted that!
.1 theit was "feeling" in the board which
IK c designated as "more or less, family
j disturbances." "," â¢*â¢ â¢â¢'
' The beginrjjng of ; the feeling between
the members occurred when 'the board.
â¢| nioved the bffice of the secretary to JacX
â¢)s6n. He said he had never aspired to
\u25a0\u25a0. be ' president of- the*., board,' and had'
j never 'asked any 'one to vote for him. He
"denied in.' ah 'emphatic manner that he
.tuÂ«.d ever told ,Dr/ Mayhew that he would
ruin Dr.-MaS'htfw's practice at'Palo Alto
"â¢and 'cause - him to' lose his millionaire
patients living- there. --.*;
â¢ Dr. Cool said that- Dr. Steele had
informed him that "questions In ana
! to ray" -had. b'etn giv^n out, but Steele
would not tell him .where he got that
Infohrnation. Steele ..had, however,
pkLCfrd Jilmselfon record tÂ»y addressing:
him. '4. letter, which letter was in pos
session of . the . committee." Mayhew's
â¢ rmme- was, not" mentioned in. the letter.
When questioned by Attorney Braun
" -as "to- the statements that had appeared
ih .the. Chronicle on Sunday." June 18,
1805, regrar.diÃg the conditions of af
fairs trristlng in" the board. Dr. Cool
replied: \u25a0 *"I .refuse to be interviewed
by repojters.^' C*\'-
i Grouped around . the room were the
i eighty-five young dentists who are awalt
i ing tne ouicome of the findings of the

t interest fn the' proceedings, and expressed

â¢ The commission appointed by Lieuten
ant Governor. Alden Anderson to investi
gate the situation now alleged to be ex
isting in the. S^ate Dental Board began
i!s "siulrigs -yesterday morning in room
18 in the Ferry building. The members
of the tTvu contending factions were
there, each represented by attorneys.
\u25a0 The boaid is composed of A. J. Pills
bury (chairman). Frank A. Cromwell
(secretary) and Frank. R. Devlin.
On one side of the board sat Dr. R. H.
Cool and Dr. J. M. Dunn, representing one
faction, with" their attorney, Russel J.
I^ukinj; and opposite' sat the other fac
tion, known as . the solid five, composed
of- Dr. A. B. Mayhew, Dr. C. A. Herrick.

Dr. F. G. . Baird, with their attorney.

It is' whispered about, the St. Franci#
Hotel.t hat a conference of importance
to California ; has been quietly arranged
for at that hotel, to. take place to-morrow
afternoon. The subject Is Chinese- and
Japanese immigration to the United
States. The Initiative comes from United
States Minister John" Barrett to Co
lombia, who is reported to' have
telegraphed to this ' city request
ing that representative men of busi
ness shall be at the hotel to talk over
the Immigration matter with him. Ignor
ance is professed among the members of
the commercial organizations of the city
regarding the conference, but It is a fact
that Minister ... Barrett' has .made his
wishes known in this regard.
\u0084 Since the Merchants' Exchange decided
not to hold a public meeting until the
fpcts about the Chinese, boycott on Am
erican products are S officially reported,
from Washington, that branch of the
Oriental controversy haÂ« lagged, but lm
migiation and the status of the present
regulations -regarding the administration
of the exclusion acts and amendments
are discussed in every quarter with vigor
and Minister Barrett Is expected to ar
rive, at the St. Francis Hotel to-morrow
afternoon. Whether he has been request
ed to inquire personally concerning the
views of business men in California about
Chinese and Japanese immigration is not
known. " *â¢
" Possibly Minister Barrett .will pursue
means similar to those adopted by Mr.
Bristow when he was in this city, and
was charged by President Roosevelt with
the duty of securing all available Infor
mation relating to transportation via the
"Panama isthmus. Mr. Bristow held meet
ings and then welcomed all who had in
formation te impart. No commercial
body has yet elected representatives to
talk with Minister Barrett. '

shores of the Mississippi River opposite
Memphis, where patrons of poolrooms,
roulette, faro and other games, may
play at leisure.. â¢ â¢'. '
The site said to be' selected lies .op
posite Memphis, near, the terminus, of
the bis bridge spanning the river. ThÂ«i
parties, said t j be backed- by 'James
O'T/eary of Chicago, have already erect
ed a building, originally intended for
poolroom purposes only. The refusal
of the telegraph company to serve race
reports, however, caused the postpone
ment of " the scheduled opening. The
proprietors have now despaired of
opening, it is said, and will *ell out
right to Gella. Adler & Idles.
Since the poolroom owned by G. C.
Bennett has been allowed to operate
for many -.years near the new â¢locatiqn,

In. the league, .started the second half, of
the season on Its -way/on the Oakland
field yesterday. "The . game did cot look
good on paper, but it turned.out to be
a rattling contest' and the GJants call
ed victory their own in the twelfth' inning
1 when Matt Stanley dropped Franks',
throw at the plate, letting. Baby McLean
score a rim..
It did riot seem possible that the Oak
ianders co.uld â¢play.such* a game of bail
with" the aggregation they â¢ had ..on the
field.. For Instance, Kruger, a" man who
knows nothing" about first base but. to
run.to^it onde In a /while, was stationed
there" to .take -care of the bad throws.
Hogan â¢ had to chase flies in right field;
bo. the" line-up was not a dangerous .look
ing, one, .though the Commuters did not
'hayÂ« it. on the Giants a whole lot at
thaU * ' â¢ . < " "'â¢
Â«*For them; Van Buren was stationed at
first, Â°Cates at second andCorbett in cen-
ter field, the men playing these regular
Â°p/sitlons being all but of commission and
lit only. lor -a hospital.' Fleming, the new
outfielder, . bowed himself -into popular
favor .by cracking "out, two hits and get^
ting away with a stolen base.
Ham- Iberg had" every. Giant on' his staff
at the. opening of the trouble. \u25a0 He struck
out four- men Jn- succession in the second "
and .third inriings,: but Essiek "finally
broke the spell- by smashing c one out to"
center that 'resulted in. a- Texas Leaguer.
Atz forced- him. at second, but McCreedie "
was passed and Fleming and Van Buren
singled, letting a run through. Van Hal
tren made a pretty throw from deep cen
ter, catchrng- . McCreedle â¢at the" plate,'
otherwise it might have been .worse.
â¢ Things looked awful, bad for the Com
muters till ' Devereaux Â° Singled lri the
seyenth .and' proceeded fo steal second
without wasting any time,- as two men
â¢w'ero faded at "the" time. -.Stanley, saw U
was up. to him, so "he closed his -eyes and
swung hard enough -oh the leather -to
place ona .out to deep center and. "bring
â¢Bill home. . \u25a0 :-"
. After that, the ' two pitcher* settled
dovn and began" to work some .till the
game. -was"- ended. Both had" the. goods
and though an occasional error was com
mitted, they . did not seem to mind that
at all. but waded, right in- and pitched
baseball. â¢ Everything went lovely till the
eleventh, 'when Umpire Bray called Dev
ereatfx "safe' at second on a â¢ glide. _
AtÂ» "resented this Tuling and rfisried" at"
the indicator man. Esalck's ire was also
rpused'and he pulled Atz away and.Jn.
sisted on getting" Into the mix-up .hfm
\u25a0self. " When this started in, the whole
Portland baseball team, with the excep-.
tiori of McLean, -gathere^d around Bray
.and- it looked like an old tfme jj rough
house.* Some" wanted peace,, others de
manded fight, but it all.ended in a few
minutes! Bray, was so kindhearted that,
.he did. not even throw any Qf the Giants
out, of the game, though It looked aa
though 'the whole-, team should have been
banished. *

changed wallops at the Olympic Athletic
Club last nl&ht and three gladiators hit
the ( carpet and stayed there , until .E-
Mervln Graney, referee and "honest
blacksmith.'.*- declared' them out of the
running. AH the boys were well matched
and .trained for the fray. The Olympic
Club boys > showed to advantage over
their outside opponents and this is due to
the coaching of De Witt Van Court, the
club's instnictOT.
/V\'. Letcher of the" Olympio -Club re
trieved the laurels 'lost by Willie Dwyer
the previous night .by knocking Joe Kane
"out In two rounds. .' Le tcher'i victory was
a popular one' and he was given a great
reception. Kane was game to the core i
and fought all the . way. Even when J
practically helpless from the heavy blows
administered by I<etcher, he Â° was- willing
to continue, but Referee Graney humane
ly stopped the uneven contest: Letcher
will- bear watching and should reach the
top- In the 122 pound class,' as he Is fast
and a stiff puncher. : â¢ /.-. "
The entertainment opened with a four
round go between 'Eddie Mennte and
Jimmy Carroll. It went the limit and
was highly interesting. Mennle was the
stronger and the aggressor, but .little
Carroll proved the cleverer. Carroll de-.
served more than cheers for his gallant
snowing. . . '\u25a0cÂ«SS !
C. Schultz" and J. O'Connell fought each
other to a standstill and the Judges,
Stewart Carter and William Cartwright
disagreed. Referee Graney. ' magnani
mously decided that both boys should re
ceive a medal and the members ; con
curred. Schultz- proved a two â¢ handed
boxer and will develop, O'Connell was a
mlnature Sharkey and, like the sailor,
was full of fight. i."t-y
Despite an j injured! thumb, Willie
Leonard again proved his right to cham
pionship laurels by making Bob Ritchie
stop in two rounds.' "lt was a pretty ex"
h!b.ition while It lasted. "Leonard planted
a. couple in his "dining-room" and Ritchie
felt depressed.. He dropped to the floor
and would not. get up until the referee
shooed the relentless Leonard away.
J. . Moore of the Olympio Club dropped
J. Irwin In half a minute's fighting and
Irwin's auburn locks }o3t their curL He
succumbed to a punch In the stomach
and had to be escorted out of the ring.
G. Murray took a* beating from T. Mc-
Laughlln. The latter was given the de
cision because he did the cleaner hitting.
Mupray- was game and stayed the limit,
but that Is ail that could be .said . In his
favor. . . . .
â¢ Tad Rlordan, bustled J. Mecchi for four
rounds.and gained .a decision. J. Sulli- 0
van, another find, was ready to gÂ© against
Al Kaufmann, but -the doctor refused to
'allow .him. to go to the slaughter because
he- was out of condition. Taprico, who was
beaten by Kaufmann 'the previous night,
was sent to the hospital, which attests
that ' Kaufmann has a 'Trick" In either
hand. :';;.\u25a0 ' -. â¢/ â¢ ; ' i.'- . - ._ :
Previous .to the entertainment, the
members -held' a short session to elect a
nominating committee that will select

â¢ ST. ; PAUL, Aug. 1.-John-'C. Hanley, |
publisher ,of .the Alliance Advocate â¢ and !
well known throughout the West as a j
leader in the Farmers' Alliance and other*!
political movements, has> been arrested j
by United States Marshal Grlmshaw on
a charge of using the .mails in connecV*
tlon with, a scheme to defraud.
For moro than a yjear the local con
cern has been 'plpsed down. AbÂ»ut one
month aj;o, hov/evcr, the property was
bought up by Martin B. Daly, general
manager of the East Ohio Gas Com
pany, a well-known Rockefeller cor
poration. The plant is now being
overhauled at an outlay of $100,000. It
will, be turning out . carbon products
by September 15, it was announced of
ficially yesterday.
Burton Â£\ Foster, manager of the
company: sviid th.it in addition to the
plant here, branches will be established
in the natural gas belts of Ohio and
a mammoth organization will be built
up rapidly to* compete with the Na
tional .Company. â¢ Daly is now abroad,
but will return August 15 and immedi
ately thereafter the financing will be
begun. The ' company will be, reor
ganized and will probably be given a
new name, among other changes.
Foster admitted that Rockefeller
capital is interested in the project and
spoke optimistically of the future of
the company about to-be formed. He
said that one carbon customer -has al
ready been t secured that will net $100,
080 a year to the concern. He also in
timated -that various lighting plants
and electrical concerns will throw
enough patronage to the new ofganiza
tion to inSure for it great progress.
Foster said that the new- company
will be maintained as an independent
institution, regardless of its. backing,
and will have the distinction of being
the only independent carbon company
on American soil.
CLKVELAXP, Ohio. August 1. â ;The
Plain Dealer to-day says: The .-National
Carbon Company, known as the carbon
trust, will soon have a competitor with
â¢imnifr.se financial backing. It de
veloped lTjre yesterday that Rocke
feller interests are behind 'the United
[Statc-3 Carbon Company. which soon
| will bo financed with a capitalization

Butter, Cheese and Errs.
" The situation' ln Butter remains unchanged,
the market being abundantly supplied and
quiet. Cheese rules firm for the fine grade 3,
which are in light supply, but weak and quiet
for the lower grades, which are over-plentiful.
Eggs are steady at the advance already
noted, but the market is quiet and without
especial feature.

Deciduous! and Citrus Fruits.
"An easier feeling -prevailed in the market
for fresh fruits and prices of most descriptions
had a downward tendency under more liberal
offerings and a rather sluggish demand. Apri
cots ' and Figs were exceptions, supplies of
those descriptions being extremely light. The
canners â¢ were indifferent buyers In the open
market and were only picking up bargains,
being overloaded with contract supplies of
Bartlett Pears. Small packages of tree fruits
were In good supply and generally easy.
Peaches in open btoxes were â¢ decidedly weak.
Small open boxes from Sonoma sold at 40@600
and large boxes from other- sections from SOc
to Ssc, with occasional sales of fine \u25a0 Early
Crawfords \u25a0 reported at $I@l 25. The Appte
market was badly congested and weak except
for gilt-edged offerings of Gravenstelns In 4
tier boxes, which, occasionally commanded a
premium.' Cantaloupes and Nutmeg Melons
were plentiful and lower, and Grapes were
weak at the old quotations, with supplies more
than sufficient for market needs.. In the Berry
line Blackberries and Huckleberries were plen
tiful and lower, while the best lots of Rasp
berries and- Strawberries were In good 'ae
mand at firm rates.- The .Lemon market was
weak for- general offerings while all other"
Citrus goods were steady. A carload of extra
fancy . Santa Barbara Lemons was received
and the stock was held at a substantial pre
mium. - - "

%@lc. Generally clear weather in the/Korth
west developed evidence of a. lack of strength
in wheat prices at the" start, the opening quo
tations on September being unchanged to %c
lower at W>Vic to &5%c. Sentiment, however,
soon became bullish and prices made a quick
rally. An official forecast or rain to-night in
Minnesota and the Dakotas started active cov
ering by shorts. . In addition - foreign . news
confirmed in a general way what was < heard
yesterday, concerning poor prospects for the
Russian crop.. There was also enlarged . Eu
ropean inquiry for American wheat. This fact
suggested a possibility <of better export busi
ness In the. near â¢ future. Numerous reports
from private,- sources were received from \u25a0: the
spring whsat districts, but advices regarding
damage by rust were decidedly contradictor!'.
Some of the reports claimed , that -the' crop
would be of exceptionally good quality. Other
reports asserted : that great damage had al
ready been done , by. the blight. During the
nrtst half of the session offerings were llghtr
As a result the price of September advanced
to 80U.C. Later there was a complete reversal

an offset. The unresponsiveness of the gener

no improvement is indicated except clay lands
in South Carolina, while on sandy land the
crop has deteriorated in that State. In Geor
g!a it Is fruiting rapidiy where sufficient Tains
have occurred, but In other localities of that
