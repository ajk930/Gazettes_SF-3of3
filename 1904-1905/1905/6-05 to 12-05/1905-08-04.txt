WOOSTER, Ohio, Aug. 3.â With a re
quest from Captain Taggart's attorney
that the court order Mrs. Taggart to per
mit her husband to see their two sons,
the Taggart divorce hearing was re
turned to-day. Judgo Easton ruled that
both parties had equal rights in thÂ» chil
dren, though they were temporarily un
der the mother's care.
The first witness, Howard Taggart,
brother of the plaintiff, said he lived with
the Taggarts at Fort Thomas, Kentucky,
. from Vb"J3 to IS9B. He described a visit of
Lieutenant Rlther to the Taggart house,
where he had an interview with Mrs.
Taggart in the parlor at 1:30 o'clock In
the morning while Captain Taggart was
away. The witness discovered Rither'n
presence, he said, and the latter hurried
away and did not call again.
A week later Mrs. Taggart handed the
witness an anonymous letter, asking him
if he knew the writing. The Jetter ad
vised the captain to watch his wife, de
' daring that Rither was taking her to a
resort in Newport. The witness said he
never mentioned Rither's early morning
call or the ietter to his brother.
Mrs. Taggarts alleged capacity for
beer was given as five glasses at one
fitting, when the witness described a
drinking bout between Mrs. Taggart and
the wife of another Officer at Fort Thom
as. The contest was for the champion
ship of the garrison, the witness said, and
the contestants were backed by officers.
Mrs. Taggart told him afterward, the
'witness said, that her opponent won the
matrh, drinking nine goblets to Mrs. Tag
' gart's five.
Howard Taggart testified that his sis
ter-in-law drank habitually with the of
ficers and prided herself on taking her
whisky straight, laughing at the men for
mixing water with it. The captain, the
witness said, objected to his wife giving
their sons beer.

NEW YORK. Aug. 3.â ln the rapid
inarch of events preliminary to the
peace conference tbe most' significant
thing to-day was the disclosure of tho
purpose of President Roosevelt to
show an especia.l mark of favor to the
Japanese plenipotentiaries, which is
understood as part of the President's
plan to induce the representatives of
the Mikado to announce to the Rus
sians an "irreducible minimum" which
Mr. Â«le Witte ca.n accept. It has been
ordered that the programme for Sat
urday's reception and introduction be
changed and that the Japanese envoys
be given precedence of half an hour.
As originally arranged, the Russian
visitors were to have been received
first, but to-day this was changed. An
order was received at Washington re
versing the order of departure of the
men-of-war. The Tacoma will leave
with Baron Komura and his party at
9 o'clock; the Chattanooga, with Mr.
de Witte and his party, at 10 o'clock.
The Japanese will arrive lirst and spend
a full hall-hour on the Mayflower with
the President before the Russian dele
gation arrives, and there will be ample
time for the President, if he~chooses,
10 express the hope that Japan -will
see her way clear to suggest terms
that Russia can accept with dignity.
The news that the Japanese envoys
were to bo received first was communi
cated to Baron Komura anÂ«l Mr. de
Wltte by Mr. Pierce, Assistant Secre
tary of State. The Japanese visitors
were naturally elated.
Of much significance was the visit of
the British Embassador. Sir Mortimer
Duraml, to the President . at , \u25a0 Oyster
Bay to-day. Sir Mortimer Insisted that
he did not come to participate in the
peace negotiations, but it is inconceiv

In Miss Pearl J. Sanderlln. a comely
lass of 17 years. San Francisco has a re
markable character. *Mlss Pearl lives with
her mamma at 930 Washington street, but
she loves nature, writes poetry and is
happy when she can steal far from the
madding crowd to drink in the divine
afflatus. â¢
When the shadows were growing long
on the hillsides Wednesday < afternoon
Miss Pearl felt that the spell of poetry,
was upon her, so she, hurriedly boarded
a car /and 1 rushed' toward' the \ sad % sea,
neve'r?stoppihg until she had .found 'a se
cluded spot over the surging Golden Gate
in the vicinity of Bakers Beach.
The,". young lady went there to wrlto
poetry, carrying in her mind visions of
Tennyson, of Byron, of Poe and others
who have written apostrophes to the
surging mainâ and in her: reticule a 22
caliber revolver, for Miss Pearl Is some
what of a shot as well as a poet. -
The. young woman's experiences during
the afternoon would furnish material for
a volumeâ not of poetry, . as she had
planned, but of adventures and hair
breadth escapes by the thundering sea,
which she had hoped to pacify by her
poems.
After drinking In the. inspiration of her
isolated sitting with nature for some
moments Miss Pearl began to write her
poem, beginning â
- I stand amid the roar
Of a surf- tormented shore,
And hold within my hand
Grains of golden sand â
But she got no further before there
was a violent Interruption. The inter- j
prejter of nature heard a stir of scurrying
feet. Looking behind her she beheld a
monstrous six-footer with a revolverâ a
masked . and bewhiskered highwayman.
He fired five shots with such rapidity as
to suggest a weapon of the automatic
magazine type 4 but the divine afflatus
was with her and .the. villain's shots
could not penetrate the halo. Not a sin
gle bullet struck the daughter of the
muses.
Dropping her manuscript, the practical
lover of rhyme opened her purse, pulled
out her little revolver and began to emp
ty its contents in the direction of the
scoundrel who had broken into her train
of thought. Realizing that he would
surely give up the ghost unless he be
stirred . himself, the bandit - - ungallantly
Knocked Miss Banderlin's weapon into
the sea. Vandalism was soon getting the
best of literature in the strange battle
by the waves, but the child bt respiration
had a card up her sleeve, so' to speak,
and the wretch who had interfered with
her poetry was' soon discomfited to such
an extent that Miss Pearl believes he Is
languishing somewhere in mortal. pain.
â¢ In 'a twinkling the young woman . re
called her anatomical accomplishments
and dealt the vandal a kick that j would
have done . Justice to Fay Templeton,
darling high-kicker of comic opera. One
blow from her little foot settled the van
dal. Miss Pearl remembers no more. Her
assailant's remains -have npt been found
by the police. , . .
Corporal Van Meter and Private War
moth . of the . Seventh Coast Artillery
found the young lady wandering fright

the, evening, she .had , set aside for the
completion of -her poem. She was in the

poem lost, her revolver in the sea. She is
I confined to her apartments just now, but

It was seen at once that the presence
of a physician was unnecessary, and the
attendants contented themselves with
notifying the police of West Sixty-eighth
station, whither 'the body was later re
moved in a patrol. wagon. There a search
of the pockets revealed letters, the writ
ing on which, although scarcely decipher
able, indicated the name to have been
Robert W. Criswell, with a residence in
the Hotel Belleclaire.
None of those who were supposed to
have been" in Criswell's confidence were
able to. assign a cause for the man to
have ended his life, for they are agreed
that he was singularly contident that he
would be acquitted on the charge now
hanging over him.
Criswell was arrested recently . on a
charge of criminal libel, preferred against
him by Representative Joseph L. Rhinock
of Kentucky. In his weekly publication,
the New Yorker, Criswell had printed an
article about the recent visit of Miss
.Roosevelt," the President's daughter, to
Cincinnati, and told ~of the various per
sons who were introduced to her on the
race track, 'among 'them Mr. . .Rhlnock,
who, the article. said, once had been in
dicted for. stealing money from a man on
the race track.
Criswell's explanation was that the ar
ticle had been sent to him by a friend
in whom he had the greatest confidence,
who was -then in. California, and he
asked to be permitted . to. communicate
with him. He caused a correction to be
placed in the New Yorker's . next issue.
He was placed under ball and was held
for trial : in \u25a0 the Special Sessions \u25a0 Court,
with the understanding that the trial
would notbe helduntil autumn.
Just as the train was pulling out of , the
station, a ,miiii, evidently.' under stress of
great excitement, ran down the steps from'
the Street, and, ninn.ng the kngth of the
platform, --leaped' in front of the cars,
which had 'attained considerable speed.
AVhen the train. was stopped_the body had
been cut to pieces. ; ; .The tragedy nad been
jeet-n standing; on' the
platform; ar)(l by- two, of the*, passengers in
the/f orward . car. â¢ Their" cries warned the
others and it was only with difficulty
that the train men prevented a panic, no
fewer than four women .fainting... '
. When the platform guards had located
the body the train was divided into two
parts and from under the forward truck
of the third car. the body was extricat
ed and lifted \u25a0\u25a0 to the platform. Then the
train was . backed up to the other end
of the platform and the passengers re
quested to alight and avail themselves of
the local service, and it was announced
that no ..expresses would run for some
time. '\u25a0\u25a0:''

j ST. PAUL, Aug. 3.â The second day of

; the \u25a0 strikers, all ithe" operators on one
i branch of the Great Northern in North
! Dakota having gone back to work and
i thirty - or "forty mqre having signified

Ithe strikei-s that the freight traffic has'
\u25a0been completely paralyzed. 1 There has;
i been much delay at many points in the â¢

The stories about the men going back to

There is a- charge being made against us
that I would like to contradict. 'It was said
that by my orders the men that went out
"turned their boards- red": that is. displayed
"<!a"Yiger signals to all approaching trains, and
that this was Hone merely to embarras the
(company arid delay traffic.' It was done, but
| it was done to protect life and property. Some
[ ag<*nts or. operators that were called out. would
i be sore" to have train orders not yet delivered, i
Perhaps some of those orders could not' be de
livered for twelve hours. Now, if the men
were to leave their posts and fail to deliver
the orders serious accidents might happen. I
could not tell what operators had train orders
to deliver, so I Instructed all operators to
turn their boards 'red on quitting. This would
force the trainmen on every train to stop at
the station and make sure there were no orders
j before proceeding.
As for the report that/ our men have been
cutting the wires â there's no truth In It. All
our men are Instructed to do nothing unlawful.

and to-night several hundred smeltermen
held a meeting and. marched in a body to
the depot, surrounded the structure and
compelled Spurrier, to quit work under
pain of "being escorted out of town," an
expression which is. significant in Butte
circles. Other operators were looked for,
but "none were found. \u25a0â¢â¢,-â¢'

"by the division superintendent in the lat

At Basin, forty miles north of Butte,

He said little; yet spoke volumes. The

Based on figures given by Mr. Sato,
the- war lias cost $500,000,000. If the
Japanese envoys insist upon being; re
imbursed an additional 50 per cent above
their actual losses it means that Russia
will be asked. to pay an Indemnity of
fully $750,000,000.
"Do you think -the- negotiations will

then replied deliberately:
"Yes, I think that peace ... will come
with the negotiations."

amcirig a large number of people now out

the fever. The marine hospital officers
have been besieged with applicants for
various positions, and there is apparently
a widespread belief that the Government
is to turn loose a golden stream in the

that no monoy is to be spent by the â¢Gov

VAU DAMAN'S SIDE.
Dr. C. M. Brady returned to-day from
Lake Providence, La., on the Mississippi
River in North lyouisiana. bringing in
formation that the Italians who invaded
that peeticn have been completely isolated
and are. under constant observation. The
case of fever th?re Is carefully . guarded
and every precaution has been taken to
pre\ ent further infection. . . ,
Much surprise was expressed at the
State Board of Health when a dispatch
rrached it to-day from Dr. Gremillon
at Alexandra announcing the appearance
of a cisc of yellow fever there.
, Rapiues Parish had taken extraordi
nary measures to keep out the infection,
and it was thought that none of the
fugitive Italians would be able to pass
the cordon of guards with which she
had surrounded herself. The Alexandra
case was traced to New Orleans, and
that opens up the question of â¢ the
efficiency of "certain quarantines estab
lished in the country; parishes* > The
period of incubation of yellow fever Is
five days, and this Italian, therefore,
must have got into Rapides within that
time, although the quarantine has been
in effect for a much longer period. There
Is naturally much anxiety among the
health officials to know how many more
Italians have slipppd out of Xew Or
leans recently and managed to have made
their way into uninfected localities.
CASE AT ALEXANDRA.
Health in the matter of enfoicins sani
tary and hygienic measures. No one
seems to have had any idea until the
developments of the past two weeks of
the do:>!urable conditions . that have ex
isted in the Italian 'lUisrur. Hundreds
of people have been found crowded into
ramshackle tenements; seme of them
built perjiaps a teniury ago, and sur
rounded with none of the essentials of
the most primitive sanitation and hy
giene. The district has been a rich lieid
for the planting of epidemic diseases,
nr.d there is a strong demand that laws
shall be pas-sec! and enforced to revolu
tionize thc?e -conditions, not only in the
present infected area, but in other parts
of the city. It !Â« not improbable also
that the movements to bring Italian'lm
migrants here on a large scale will suf
fer, partly by reason of the terror wh'ch
the present infection has spread among
the Italians, and partly by reason of the
entirely uiuvnrrr.n.ted j prejudice which
seems to have arisen against extensive
Italian colonization. With : the â¢ negro
flocking to the City. Louisiana and Mis
sissippi planters have- had â¢ a \u25a0 difiicult
problem to eolve in obtaining -adequate
labor to til! their fields. Thousands of
Itallens have in recent- years replaced
.negroes in the sugar. fields of Louisiana,
and. as the Italian is usually an excel
lent laborer, th<?r"?_has for some time
been a strong movement to provide such,
facilities in the way .of ajv immigrant
station a? would divert to thi? gateway
a larger proportion of Italian immi
grants.

Pain 'in the \ -
Head
Is a danger signal. Warning
you that the brain nerves are
exhausted â irritated, and are
undergoing 1 an unnatural strain.
Frequent and prolonged at-
tacks of pain weaken the gen-
erative power of the nerve
cells of the brain, and lead to
loss of memory, melancholy,
spasms, epilepsy, and frequent-
ly insanity.
When the brain nerves are
weakened they are unable to
supply sufficient nerve force
to the nerves that control the
lungs, heart, stomach and
other organs, and these organs
are thus robbed of energy, and
unable to meet the demands
upon them,and they get sick.
Stop the head pains with Â£>r.
Miles' Antr-Pain Pills, and the
influence upon your general
health will be greater than you
can realize.

Dr. McClish was elected president of
the university in ISO 6. At that time the
school was largely in debt and there was
a small attendance of pupils. Under his
administration money was raised to pay
off a mortgage and indebtedness of $60,000
and in aduition an endowment of JIOO.UOO
was raised for the school. Besides the
endowment $26,000 worth of property has

At the afternoon session of the, board
Ryan protested against the assessment
for 1504 of short lines operated the
'Southern Pacific Company, artel lying
wholly in one county. The local assessors,
he siid, assessed the3e roads as "jerk
water linos" at $5000 a nlile, while the
State Board of Equalization assessed
them as main lines at $15,000 a milt;. Ryan
said he believed the board had made the
assessment under a misapprehension.
Some of these lines, he contended, operate
only one. train. a day and have no value
as main lines and should not be assessed
so high. , \u25a0\u25a0":' â¢ -
j To-morrow the assessment of the Cali
fornia Northwestern and the North Shore
roads will be considered. This will com

! SACRAMENTO, Aug. 3.â E. Black
Ryan, tax agent, and P. G. Williams, as
sistant auditor of the Southern Pacific
Company, were before the State Board
of Equalization to-day . in connec
tion with the assessments" of railroiids
operated by that corporation. Williams
; stated, in discussing the freight traffic
over the Central Paciiic, that the road
i is better equipped to handle fruit ship
ments than it has ever been, this branch
of the service having been greatly im
proved. This year there has been an in
crease in passenger traffic, due to heavy
travel westward. Colonist rates, while
low, contributed to the earnings.
Regarding the steamship earnings, Wil
liams stated that the ferry service be
tween Oakland and San Francisco had
been greatly improved. When the Key
Route first put on its boats the Southern
Pacific felt the competition keenly. The
Southern Pacific is now operating a
twenty-minute service to meet the com
petition and is getting back much of the
business it lost. The Alameda side of San
Francisco Bay is building up rapidly,
which has Increased the company's ferry
receipts 20 per cent in the last year. Most
of -{he increase in traffic between Oak
land, East Oakland and Alameda. goes to
the Southern Pacific, it was stated, while
the increase due to the advancement of
Berkeley goes largely to the Key Route.
William H. Alford asked what was the
cause of putting on the new train be
tween this city and San Francisco. Wil
liams said he did not know, but thought
it was due to public demand. Alford
said he liked the service, but found the
extra charge for a seat in the chair car a
novelty in California railroading.
Williams repeated the statement which
had previously been made to the board
that the Southern Pacific Company actu
ally owns only four miles of railroad in
the State, but operates the Central Pa
cific* the Souu.ern Pacific Company and
other lines under lease.

financial concerns that has been
brought about in Los Angeles. The Los
Angeles National Bank, the Southwest
ern National Bank and the First Na

The elder , Traphagen has for years
owned and conducted the hotel at Elsi
nore and is a man of large means.
Three years ago an exceedingly pretty
girl came to the Lake View Hotel at
Elsinore as a waitress. She -became
enamored of the son of the proprietor.
Some time later there was a midnight
marriage in the County \u25a0 Clerk's office at
Riverside, with the Sheriff as best man.
This was on March 23, 1903. The young
man, then but 21, deserted the girl on
the night of hfs marriage and she re
turned alone to the hotel conducted by
her father-in-law. He ordered her off
the premises and assisted her with such
roughness that he was arrested for bat
tery and paid a large line on pleading
guilty. To escape public wrath, the elder
Traphagen decided to receive his son's
bride and a little later the son, James
H.- Traphagen, was rounded. up and made
to stay with his wife in they hotel. Both
were employed by the father. Later they
moved to Los Angeles, where, on Janu
ary 15 of this year, young Traphagen
deserted his wife and went to Eureka.
He has since refused to return to her and
the eleven-month-old baby boy and has
not contributed anything toward their
support.
Mrs. Traphagen, in her complaint, al
lr-.eed that while she and her husband
remained under the parental roof the
defendant treated her with the greatest
cruelty, that he compelled her to sign
a. contract not to speak to any man save
her husband and not to. receive any com
pany whatever. She states that he con
stantly accused her of infidelity and made
like allegations to his son. The couple
fled to Los Angeles, hoping that the
persecution would end. The young wom
an declares that the father continued to
visit the son and to pour in his ear
stories of her alleged unfaithfulness.
Finally the young man left, and ever
since the girl wife has been compelled
to support herself and her child.
RIVERSIDE, Aug. S.â Mrs. Beulah
Traphagen to-day began auit against her
father-in-law, Charles S. Traphagen of
Elsinore, proprietor of the Lake View
Hotel, for ?10,000 damages for the alleged
alienation of her husband's affections.
She^ alleges that her father-in-law caused
her* husband to desert her.

"You must know that the action of the
eleam causes a corrosion to form at the
â¢eat of the safety valve. This corrosion
it net exactly a rust and yet its effect
is not entirely unliKe rust. It is sticky
and un'.tr-fcs cleaned out will soon cause
the valv* to ttick in such a manner that
oO.i rooosi of steam could not set it off.
Neither was tne valve properly weighted.
If It had bctn. when the pressure had
passec* the danger point, tee whole valve
would have been blown out. Nothing
could have prevented that. The regula
' ticms require that every safety valve must
be blown at least once every three
months. Had the valve been popped
within the last three months, the steam
would have cleaned out all the corrosion.
"I am very' certain that the steam gauge
did not register correctly. Had It regis
tered correctly there would not have been
such a tremendous pressure of steam at
the time of the accident. When that
crownsheet collapsed the boiler was
carrying a pressure between 2jO and 400
pounds."
Lieutenant Yates and Ensign Wade of
the Eeunington were before the' court of
inquiry to-day. Officers of the court say
,tAat they do not expect to be able to

The naval court of inquiry continues its
daily session on board the flagship Chi
cago. Testimony is still being heard by
the board and no formal report has been
made to the admiral, but no information
as to the probable length of the inquiry
is available.
Of the injured seamen remaining in the
military hospital those still in the most
furious condition, Mueller and Sullivan,
probably will recover, so that now there
may be no further additions to the death
list. Yesterday eighteen of the men were
discharged, and there are now only thir
ty-five In the hospital. Hospital Surgeon
/v needier spoke in terms of praise of the
civilians who have assisted In the care of
the injured boys. He said:
"The women of San. Diego have aided
materially in the rapid recovery of the
boys. Not a day passes but several visit
the tick at the barracks, read to the
boys to help them pass the long hours
and writ* their letters for them. Those
women have done a world of good, i
don't see how we -could have got along
without them."
Ex-cry- afternoon the Bick men are en
tertained by the marine band from the

EAK "DIEGO. Aug. 3.â The Tribune this
evening prints the. . following interview
with an engineering officer of the flag-
Ehip Chicago on the Bennington disaster:
"After the Chicago reached port last
Thursday morr.ir.g-. 1 was one of the party
which boardffl the Bennington and made
a thorough, examination of the Benning
ton's boilers. What I saw in the Ben
r.higton's engine-room that day will bear
oi:t the truth of my statement. The
â¢waole accident is due to the negligence
of some one, I know but Â«m not going to
Bay who is to blame. Had i.ue accident
not happened when it did there is ao
doubt it would have come Later and would
have been caused from any one of peveral
reasons.
"My examination of the boiler demon
strated to me conclusively that at the
time of tho accident there was not enough
circulating water over the crownsheet.
The boiler is what is known as a "loco
motive boiler.' The circulating water Is
over the top of the crownsheet. At the
time of the accident, this water had been
allowed to run low. This left nothing
but the steam above the top of the crown
sheet ar.d as a result the top of the eheet
vis soon heated red hot. Later It be
came white hot. This, of course, weak
ened the crownsheet and with the tre
mendous amount of steam pressure above
caused it to collapse.
\u25ba- "How the circulating water was allowed
to run s>o low of course I don't know/.
However, I do not believe that any at
tention was paid to the water gauge.
"Another thing, from what I have seen,
neither the water gauge, the steam gauge
nor the safety valve was in proper con
dition. The safety valve on that boiler
would not have popped off under jOO
pounds pressure. This is shown by j
condition of the valve. The seat of the
valve is corroded in such a manner that
it shows conclusively that it had not
been popped off for at least a year and
very possibly eighteen months.

LONDON, Aug. 3. â The session In

was taken up with a discussion of the
foreign policy. Â£arl Percy, Under Sec
retary for Foreign Affairs, said that,
under the present circumstances, it was
impossible to discuss the changes in
the Far East that might be brought
about by the war or changes that it
might be desirable to introduce in the
Anglo- Japanese alliance when it was
thought right tÂ© renew If He noted
with satisfaction that all agreed upon
the desirability of renewing 3uch an
alliance. He thought that the general
state of Europe presented no cause for
anxiety.
Reverting to the Far East, he said it
was true that, while Great Britain, in
common with other countries, was los
ing trade! in China, Japan's trade in
that country was increasing. Efforts
were being made to obtain fresh mar
kets in the interior, and China had
promised, If the Chinese were unable
to finance the proposed railroad through
the Yangtse Valley to Redstone Basin,
in the province of Szechuan, to apply
first to British and American capital to
build It. Great Britain, he said, was
now negotiating with France for the
Joint construction of the line.

ago and suggestions that objections to
it were raised by Germany were un
founded. Ernest George Prettyman,
secretary to the Admiralty, to-day in
reply to questions said definitely that
no protest regarding the visit of the
fleet had been received.
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.. Aug. 3.â
Former Lieutenant Governor John A.
Lee resumed his testimony to-day in the
trial of Senitor F. H. Farris on- the
charge of bribery. Lee's denial at the
former trial of Farris that he (Lee)
wrote the letter sending the $7000 in ques-"
tion back to p. J. Kelley of New York,
representative' of the baking powder in
terests, was taken up in a severe cross
examination by the defense. Several
checks from Kelley to Lee were intro
duced and. identified, but were not ad
mitted in evidence by Judge Davis, who
ruled that the inquiry should be limited
to transactions that took place in St.
Louis. .
This precludes the introduction of a
number of, letters and checks which the
defense intended to offer as evidence.
When the cross-examniation was com
pleted, the State took the witness on
redirect examination. Lee testified con
cerning "the letter purporting to return
$7000 to Kelley, which at the former trial
he had denied writing, but yesterday ad
mitted that he had written by saying
that he had written the letter Jbecause
he feared that there might be trouble at
some time and the letter was for the
purpose of covering up the transaction
concerning the conveyance of the $7000,
but that ha did not return the .$7OOO to
Kelley.

To P. H. McCarthy, President of thÂ« Building
Trades Councilâ Sir: Since you havo taken
upon yourself the right of dictator of the
union men of this city and have declared
all who will not submit to the dictation of
yourself or ypur master, Abe Ruef, to be In
league with the Citizens* Alliance, I would
like to know from you a few things which do
not appear exactly right to my mind.
How Js It, McCarthy, tnat you are at this
I tinfe declaring with a loud mouth that Abe
Ruef, a mercenary politician. Is the great
champion of labor, when only laet November,
during the Congressional campaign, you de
clared very forcibly on the BtreÂ«t corners that
he was the greatest raacal unhung? What has
prompted your attack upon John E. McDougald,
a union man of long standing and unblemished
record? How did Harry Gray of the firm of
Gray Brothers bring about tne conciliation be
tween yourself and Abe Kuef? Why Is the
product of Gray Brothers considered fair by
you when they employ over 100 non-union men
on their plant and work them longer hours
nnd pay them SO cents per day less wages than
the fair employer* of the same Industry in
this city? And what becomes of the money
thus saved?
How Is it that the schedule for hauling ma
terial for Gray Brothers Is lower than that of
other firms, and why do their teamÂ«ters have
to work longer hours? What prompted you, on
the very eve of this coming primary election,
to stuff the executive board of the United La
! bor League, destroy the efforts of union men
i for clean representation, ani close the rolls of
' the league to prevent it again pursuing the
policy tor which It was organized?
These ara some Questions which I ehouM
like to have answered. There are many other
matters pertaining to your policies which would
be made plainer with the calcium of exposure,
but for the present can you answer these, and
answer them quickly, or perhaps you may not
be able to deliver the goods in the shape of
the unions into the grasping clutches of your
master AbÂ« Ruef, it the coming primary.

John Barrett, the newly appointed
American Minister to Colombia, arrived
In San Francisco yesterday from Wash
ington and Is staying at the St Francis
Hotel. Minister Barrett, while accred
ited to Colombia and ostensibly on his
way to his new post of duty, after sev
eral months' service In the republic of
Panama, is hero in connection with the
commercial relations existing between
the United States and China, particu
larly as regards the boycott inaugu
rated by the Chinese guilds against
. American products. v
He insists, however, that his mission
is not of an official character â that is.
he has not been commissioned to come
to the coast, but has made it his per
sonal business to come this way in or
dÂ»r to acoualnt himself with the feel
ing of the people of the coast as to the
boycott and Incidentally Interview
somo of the merchants who are en
gaged In the Oriental trade.
Minister Barrett, while conceding
that the Chinese guilds are all-power
ful in their country, where they repre
sent the bone and sinew of the nation,
is of the opinion that the present alarm
shown by the people of this country
over the action of the Chinese Is un
necessarily exaggerated. He firmly be
lieves that whatever grievances tha
Chinese guilds have will soon be dis
pelled when they are made to realize
that our Government is disposed to act
fairly with them In the matter of Im
migration.
PREDICTS CHANGE OF POLICY.
He Is also of the opinion that our fu
ture policy as regards the Orient will
depend much upon the results of the
peaco conference between the repre
sentatives of Japan and Russia, and
predicts that the next two years will
witness a great change in the policy
of the United States. Such a change
will be attended with a noticeable im
provement of our commercial relations
in the Far' East. .
Of the situation in Panama. Minister
Barrett said: ':?P\k
' Since my return from Panama I have read
much in the papers as to the feeling of the
people of the Pacific Coast, and especially of
the merchants of San francisco. that the open
ing of that great waterway will seriously af
fect commerce here, in that your port will lose
much of the Pacific traffic mat it now enjoys.
While this - may be Â«the case for a time, you
will eventually realize rnai the caual is a
benefit to the coast, for what you may lose in
one direction you will gain twofold In another.
- When the Suez canal was under construction
Bombay loudly protested that the commerce of
the Orient would pasa its port and that its peo
ple would â¢ suffer by the fact. \u25a0-. instead, history
Fhows us , that the trade at Bombay, after the
canal was finished, increased as It had never
done before. . '.',

have been encountered at the Isthmus, for they

Dr. Ward yesterday told Foreman An
drews of the Grand Jury that he could
make a thorough investigation of the
alleged illegal registration at the City
and County Hospital at his convenience
notwithstanding the objections of. Su
perintendent McQuaid. The meeting of
the Grand Jury, which was to have been
held to-day was postponed after this
announcement, but Andrews will in
spect the institution Saturday or Mon
day.
Two discrepancies were found in the
registration at the Almshouso yester
day by Foreman Andrews in allowing
forty-one incorrlgibles to register. It
is said that they are governed by the
same laws as though serving a term in
prison. Twenty per cent of those on
the register had left the Institution.
Andrews will make a further inspec
tion of the lncorrigibles case to-day
and order the names of the absent
voters stricken from the list
A new Grand Jury will be formed aa
aoon as Judge Lawlor returns from his
vacation, about August 14. Andrews
was notified yesterday to have his re
port for the year made out by August
19. Judge Muraskey Is presiding dur

to the character and quality of the men

he eulogized them as representing the
best element and as standing for hon

speaker adverted to his stand with the
Board of Supervisors on the gas rates
and was cheered to the echo.
L. H. Anderson was also introduced
and^made a stirring speeoh that added,
to the enthusiasm. Following the
speakers came several vocal selections
by popular members of the club and
then an adjournment was taken until
a plentiful supply of refreshments was
consumed. A resolution setting forth
the stand of the club against the cor
rupt municipal control was adopted
unanimously and the Republican
League was given three rousing cheers
as the members Quitted the hall.

The 21erchairts' Association submitted
a. long list of names yesterday to Regis
trar Adams and called his attention to
the fjict that these persons were not liv
ing at the places designated in the rÂ«glÂ«
ter. A request was added that they be
cited to appear and show cause why their
names should not be stricken off.
Although Adams received this commu-
Eicatlcn from the association early in the
afternoon he gave it no attention. Sub
servient to Ruef end Schmitz, he would
make no effort whatever to Investigate.
Last night he Insolently declared that he
would take his time about it His at
titude was Identical with that of Hos
pital Superintendent lucQuaid, who in
hoodlum-like manner refused to allow the
Grand Jury foreman access to the wards
to examine patients regarding registra
tion frauds.
The following iras the list of names
presented by the Merchants' Association i
TWEXTY-EIGHTH DISTRICTâ NINTH PRS
CINCT.
"Now that we . have got our watchers
selected and can be reasonably sure of a
square deal," said President Sullivan of
the Anti-Ruef Labor League last evening.
"we are confident we will put up a. fight
that will surprise our most ardent friends.
The people little "dream to what extent
tt?e defection from Ruef and Schmitz, in
the ranks of union labor, has taken. We
now know and state it; without fear of
contradiction that, Ruef will not have a
union labor \u25a0â¢rote to spare to throw, into
his losing Republican fight.' If he starts
to use union labor to bolster up his Re
publican end- he is lost. It is a fore
gone conclusion that he will be over
whelmingly defeated by Â£ the) San Fran
cisco Republican League and if he starts
In addition to this number a score or
more will ( remain at headquarters, S
Eddy street, ready to respond to any call
for aid that may be made. These men, to
gether with the watchers the Republican
party â¢will put in the field, will make It
extremely dangerous for those that may
make an attempt to repeat the crimes
that have added several of the adminis
tration followers to the list of inmates of
the State penitentiaries. The word Is out
that fraud will be attempted in several
of the precincts, but the Anti-Ruef La
bor League says that disaster will come
to any man that attempts to vote an
other's name. . '
The grafters are not making much
headway in the Thirtieth District. When
Ruef "butted in" the better elements of
the Republican party sought the assist
ance of Henry J. McMann, whose clean
politics has won every fight In which he
figured fas a leader. The introduction of
McMann disconcerted Ruef to the extent
that the boss found it necessary to bor
row Isadore Erb, who lives on Russ
street, and who holds down a chair in
the Supreme Court clerk's office. Ruef
thought that an "official" from the Par
rott building with a bunch of State red
tape about his neck would hypnotize the
voters of the Thirtieth District into his
lines, but McMann with Assemblyman
Francis McNamara at the head of the
Republican League ticket will win out
two to one next Tuesday.
The present fight In this district cor
responds with the contest of one year
ago, when McMann championed the nom
ination of Francis McNamara for the
Legislature.' The result of this was that
McNamara was elected by a' greater ma
jority than the vote cast for his two op
ponents. A similar result will follow
next Tuesday when Ruef and- Schmitz
will wonder "where they are at" so far
as the Thirtieth is concerned.
Its ticket completed- and every man on
it a member of a â¢ union or even hlgner
in the ranks of organized labor, the Anti-
Ruef Labor League is now turning its at
tention to ''plans to prevent fraud at the
polls next Tuesday. Last evening the of
ficers of the league occupied their time
preparing a list of 250 men out of the
hundreds that have volunteered to serve
as watchers at the booths.
VOLUNTEERS WILL WATCH.
Ruef is making a desperate fight to
down Senator Welch in the Thirty-sec
ond. The Senator has never obeyed the
political commands of Ruef and the lat
ter is out for political revenge.
John E. Heilmann, chairman, and D.
J. Wren, secretary of the regular Re
publican (anti-Ruef) Club of the Thir
ty-second district, have issued a circu
lar in substance as follows:-
A FEW AVOIiDS TO THE WORKINGMEN
OF THE THIRTY-SECOND ASSEMBLY
DISTRICT: Do not believe the malicious
falsehoods and misrepresentations contained in
the circular issued by the creatures of "Ruef"
in this dtstrict, in fact the only district out of
the eighteen in this city and county where It
was found necessary by"them to Insult the in
telligence of the worklngman and those in
sympathy with the cause of unionism.
In this circular it is charged that if the del
egates, for whom your suffrage is asked, are
elected at the coming primary they will be
pledged to and controlled by the Citizens' Al
liance, and for a complete answer and refuta
tion to this malicious charge you are simply
directed to note the occupation of many of the
nominees on the within ticket, and not only
will you find that they are enrolled under the
banner of "unionism," but are some of Its
strongest supporters; in, fact, if It Is a ques
tion of the number of "union men" on said
ticket or that of the opposition, the majority
is in favor of the Republican League ticket.
Although some of the nominees on the with
in ticket are recognized leaders in the labor
union ranks, still they are, not identified, nor
do they owe allegiance to any corrupt boss, nor
have they been imported into this district as
charged, but they are your neighbors, friends
and fellow citizens, who have lived in the dis
trict most of their li\-es, own property in the
district, and if elected will use every effort
to save San Francisco from the grip of the
grafters. â¢ â¢ â¢
The inclosed ticket is indorsed by the Hon
orable State Senator and Assemblyman from
this district, and the records speak for them
selves as to whether or not they were the
friends of labor and labor organizations.
Xow it Is squarely up to you, as good citi
zens and worklngmen, to do your duty at the
coming primary, and if you will vote the bal
lot inclosed you will secure good government
and all the blessings It implies, or. as our be
loved President, Theodore Roosevelt, says, "A
square deal for every man," a thing no gov
ernment of graft has ever yet delivered.
GRAFTERS' SLOW WORK.
BUEF FIGHTS HARD.
The San Francisco Republican League
is in possession of names'" of falsely
registered persons at the hospital. The
records in the Auditor's office give the
names of all the employes of the insti
tution for the month of July, 1905. Sev
tnty-four employes at a compensation
of $5 a month each have been recently
added to the working force of the hos
pital. The truth is as plain as the light
of day that these seventy-four men
\u25a0vrere put on a blind payroll to register
and vote in the Thirty-second Assembly
District as regular employes of the hos
pital. There has been no increase in
the number of patients to Justify the
employment of this army of new at
taches. There has been no extension
of the hospital service calling for the
engagement of extra men. The hiring
of additional helpers, dishwashers and
scullions smacks plainly of fraud.
No doubt the grafters who concocted
the scheme fancied that exposure would
not come until the ballots of the pre
cinct had been counted, but the experts
of the San Francisco Republican
League detected the fraud and informed
the Grand Jury. The grafters now ask
the tax-paying citizens of San Fran
cisco the question, "What are you go
ing to do about it?" The purpose of
the grafters to stuff the ballot box Is
publicly proclaimed and it is now up to
the law abiding citizens to decide
whether this premeditated fraud on the
elective franchise shall be consum
mated next Tuesday.
Disclosures concerning the Internal
condition, of affairs at the City and
County Hospital are startling, and it
some one connected with the present
city administration is not sent to the
penitentiary for felony there will be a
miscarriage of justice.
To-morrow evening the regular Re
publicans of the Thirty-third Assembly
District will hold a meeting at Silk's
Hall, Preolta avenue near Mission
street. The regulars in the Thirty
third are opposed by the Meincke-
French crowd.
The organization committee of the
San Francisco Republican League, con
sisting- of George D. Clark chairman,
D. A. Ryan secretary, Fairfax H. "Whee
lan, John D. Daly, David Rich, E. J.
Bo%ves, Richard J. Welch and John
Lackmann, met last night at head
quarters, 656 Market street. Arthur
Fisk attended the meeting as an advis
er. The founders of the League ar.e
quite confident that a victory over the
forces of graft will be achieved next
Tuesday.
A Joint meeting of tha campaign
committee and proposed delegates of
the Forty-fifth Assembly District was
held at League headquarters last night.
Important district meetings under
the auspices of the League will take
place to-night. '. The citizens of the
Forty-first will meet at Steimke Hall.
The meeting of Fortieth District Re
publicans will be at Franklin Hall. Re
publicans of the Thirty-seventh will
rally at Phelps Hall, 817 Devisadero
street. The legions of the Thirty
eighth will assemble at Jefferson Square
Hall.
to throw union labor votes into this fight
we will sweep the city and Mayor
Schmitz will go begging for renomination.
We are in this fight to accomplish our
purpose to defeat Abe Ruef and we mean
to do it. Tuesday will tell the story and
I am confident that on that day San
Francisco can offer thanks that the day
of its deliverance from the administra
tion that hangs Over it like a pall is at
hand."

from a' spring strongly impregnated
with mineral poisons. Until a month
ago the spring was known the country
round for its delicious water. Then th c
composition suddenly changed and peo

several had become deathly sick by tak

analyzed. He believes that recent vol

PORTLAND, Aug. 3- â "The statement
that at any time'l ever claimed 'divine
rgiht' to anything except 'life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness' is a mar
licious falsehood," said George F. Baer,
president of the Philadelpnia and Read
ing Railroad, to-day." Baer' in com
pany with his family is in Portland on
a pleasure trip.
"Those conscienceless papers which
made me appear as saying tl^at my as
sociates and I controlled the anthra
cite coal of this country by divine right
deliberately falsiried. I have said and
done some foolish things in my time,
but never anything quite so unworthy,
or idiotic as to make such an utter
ance. That falsehood was circulated at
the time "of the coal strike hearing
for the express purpose of -inflaming
the public mind.
"At that time Senator Marcus A.
Hanna said tom e: 'Baer'. don't deny
it. It won't do any good. The lie-will
travel bo fast that you : can't overtake
it.' Mr. Hanna was right and I knew
it, so said nothing by way of denial.
. "As he said to me, so I say to you, if
some one starts a lie N about -you don't 1
deny it. Live it down. That's the
only way. Prove that It is not true.
One of the greatest human feelings is '
a proneness to believe evil report. The I
world wants to hear evil so badly that !
it will believe It in preference to "good'i
report any time. As to that story about'
divine right, I think that I have lived
it down pretty successfully by this' time
and only trouble makers or their dupes
credit it." â¢ .

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Aur. Aâ
Professor Harris J. Ryan of- Cornell
University, lately appointed head of the
college of electrical engineering at
Stanford University, has made known
the plans he will follow In his depart
ment. The principal branches of. the
subject, continuous current theory, al
ternating current theory and the de
signing of electrical machinery, will ba
handled according to methods In vogue
at Cornell. The subject ot designing.
hitherto untouched, will be especially
emphasized. This subject Is of the
greatest practical importance and In
order to receive a degree from the col
lege of electrical engineering. It must
be covered along with the two other
co-ordinating branches.
The electrical department as It will
be run will encourage greatly the en
rollment of non-electrical engineers.
that is. students who have fqr their
major subject either mechanical or civil
engineering. It has been found that
in these courses, and especially in the
latter, the transmission of power
enters into, a large percentage of tho
work undertaken. At Cornell Uni
versity the course of nOn-electrlcal en
gineers is extremely popular, and Pro
fessor Ryan would welcome a like state
of affairs here. The combination of
courses usually, however, requires one
year of graduate work to enable It 3
completion.

ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS
District Attorney Boyd said that If
there were reliable men employed by
the Supervisors as special officers to ar
rest every transgressor, it would have
a healthy effect on the observance of
the existing law. Ex-Assemblyman J.
W. Atherton of Novato introduced re
solutions calling upon the Supervisors
to pass an ordinance In regard to
mountain roads and to empjoy men as
auto-police, to be stationed at different
parts of the county, to enforce both the
State and county regulations.
Among those at the meeting were:
George Mason, of Red. Hill; J. W. Ath
erton, Novato; B. G. Morse, Bolinas; C.
J .Pease, Point Reyes; F. S. Johnson,
H. J. Lucas. F. F. Cochrane, T. P. Boyd.
S. H. Olmsted and G. E. Butler. .
SAN RAFAEL, Aug. 3. â There was a
good deal of discussion at the meeting
held by prominent citizens this after
noon in the office of District Attorney
3oyd to devise ways and means to en
force the present State and county
automobile regulations. Ex-Supervisor
George Mason of Red Hill was chosen
chairman of the meeting. Letters ad
vocating' the strict enforcement of the
existing laws were read from James
Coffin of the Union Sugar Company, J.
F. D.- Curtis, manager of the Provldenae
Washington Insurance .Company, Wil
liam Babcock of the Merchants" Ex
change, and others. In the course of
the discussion, it was shown that In
many instances autoists traveling over
the prohibiteti roads have jeopardized
the lives of persons in vehicles.
C. J, Pease, who represents many
taxpayers^ said that it was dangerous
for the farmers to travel over the roads
as the autoists proceed at a high rate
of speed, regardless of the narrow road.
Rev. Dr. Crosby, head master of the
Mount Taniulpais Military School, rclted
several instances in which serious ac
cidents had barely been averted. He
thought the county would be better if
the motorists were excluded from the
use of all' highways in this county. Mr.
Eells stated that he had observed cases
on mountain roads where the most con
scientious autoist could not avoid a
mishap. Some parties said that if the
autos continued to travel over the pro
hibited roads, they would be obliged
to dispose of their holdings as it was
not safe for them to drive.
6AUSALITO. Aug. 3.â Henry Collins,
a prominent plumber of this town and
the best shot in the county, had a flgllt
for his life with an enormous, enraged
and crippled buck In Portuguese Gulch,
in the Lucas Canyon, yesterday after
noon. He has hunted for all kinds of
wild game in this county and along the
shores of Alaska, Siberia and Japan, but
never did any of -iis hunting experience
place him In such a dangerous position.
He was hunting on the grounds of the
Victor Club with Benjamin Baum of
1144 Howard street. San Francisco, Sal
vador Pacheco. Thomas â¢J. Fallon, Mi
chael Murray and Henry Marten of San
Rafael. Leo de Sella of this town and
Victor Sartort. owner of the grounds,
all club members.
â¢ One of the hunters fired two sbots at
a large buck, who was leaving the bot
tom of the gulch. 200 yards distant,
crippling- him. Collins, who was close
by, started down the sidehill tnrough
the dense brush for the bottom of the
gulch. He thought me deer was mor
tally wounded. As he was - going
through the undergrowth he ran upon
the -deer in a small clearing about
twenty-five feet In diameter. The ani
mal was in the center of a circle of
hounds. As soon as the buck saw Col
lins it- lowered its head to charge upon
him. Before the deer got within ten
feet of him Collins raised his rifle and
dropped the animal with a bullet
through the neck.
The deer fought desperately with the
dogs and again attacked Collins before
it expired. Several of the bounds were
badly wounded in the fight. The deÂ«r
was the largest ever seen around this
place and when dressed weighed 153
pounds. De Sella and Collins each killed
a spike and Pacheco and Baum a forked
horn. Collins said:
"I have been In many close places dur
ing my hunting experience, but never had
as close a call as this onÂ» and I hope that
I never will. I did not expect to en
counter the deer so soon and when I
saw him coming toward me with his
head down, ten feet away, I thought
that my time had come. I put my rifle
to my shoulder and dropped him. If I
had missed him. he would have killed me.
He is the largest deer that I ever saw
in California."

Tht- Supervisors were busy to-day
checking up the account with the Central
NÂ»rs Company and they have found a
number of discrepancies warranting big
cuts in the items. It is said to be the
opinion of some of the Supervisors that
the bilis have been stuffed and they de
clare no Â«uch amounts will be paid the
woman for stationery. Various county
officers have either been, careless and im
posed upon, or they have been participat
ing in petty grafting.
OAKLAND, Aug. S.-Mre. Lottie M.
Ciaisbey -apjjf-ared before the Board of
Supervisors to-day and demanded an ex
planation why the bills ehe held against
trre county for $400y, due on stationery
and supplies, were not paid. Some of the
\u25a0accounts with the various offices are far
too large, and as the result of . an ex
pert's ' report there has been much prun
ing. Some peculiar juggling with the sta
tionery account was unearthed and an
investigation is to be made,
Tht woman conducts' the Central News
Company, at 1203 Broadway, and had one
Otto lÂ». Hasse in her employ." During her
absence several months ago it is claimed
that Hasse assigned JI9OQ to the Central
Bank, and now since her return the
cinount of her bills calling for $1900 has
been cut to $1500. It is said that a corre
sponding reduction will be made on all
the bills, but if the reductions are made
M:s. Clat-bey threatens to employ attor
neys to defend her rights.
,lt i? alleged that several Items on the
various bills are misrepresented and
should read stationery instead of office
fvrpi'ure. Mrs. Clasby believes that the
tCrgir.g of wrong items in place of the
originate is the work of pome- one trying
tr> <io her harm.

Disappearance of Fifteen-
Year -Old Girl Followed
I by a Sensational Sequel
BERKELEY, Aug. 3. â "Mrs." Joel
A*reo has determined to fight for pos
session of her pretty 15-year-old
daughter, Esther, who disappeared last
Saturday, even though tho mother's
contest may bring upon her- the re
proach attaching to those who have not
the sanction of church or state fbr
their marital relations.
"Mother love in the case of "Mrs."
Agee has triumphed over personal
pride and she is determined that the
search for. her missing girl, nqw sup
posed to be in the custody of hor fath
er, Jesse Van V#l6or, shall be contin
ued even at the cost of an expose of
the mother's relations during 'the last
few years with the man who has posed
as her husband, but to whom she has
never been married.
It developed to-day, as a sequel to
the mother's attempt to recover Esther,
her daughter, that although she has
resided with Joel Agee at 1240 Alston
way for years as his wife the only cer
emony that united them was a hand
shake,, given by each- at a; timer when
Agee had interfered to prevent Van
Veisor from abusing the woman.' At
that time, "Mrs." Agee admits.
Van Veisor left her and she
and Agee decided that fate had
thrown them â¢ together and they â¢
would not be separated, even though the
Divorce Court had not freed the woman
from her husband, Jesse Van Veisor.
Esther Van Veisor, the little girl, was
at that time given to Mrs. E. Steele of
Peralta Park to care for and it was
from Mrs. Steele's home that the girl
disappeared last week. The mother at
once asked the police to help her find
Miss Esther and declared her belief
that Van Veisor, the father, had kid
naped the girl. .
The aftermath of this accusation was
the revelation to-day of Mrs. Van Vel
sor's life as mother and wife, which is
understood to be the ground upon
which Mrs. Steele, who admits sending
the child away to keep it from the
mother, justifies h<?r action.

DEOPPED BY A BULLET
I have never visited or talked with any one
directly or' lndirectly connected with the Syn
dicate or any of its allied corporations upon
the matter ot , its s assessments. I .did visit
Wickham Havens, who Is not connected with
the Syndicate, when he wanted to talk
me about a read through -some property. The
road wanted was Inside of the city limits and
we did not mention assessments. It has been
Fald in thp oaoers that I had stated that I
believed . that the assessments of the Realty
Syndicate should be Increased. I have neyr
made any Ftatempnt of any kind about assess
ments.
I wish that Assessor Dalton ;were here to
day, for I have something to say abou,t him.
I sent him a n<ne asking him to b? present at
the meeting to-day, bocaupe T was solng tn
charge Jilm with dereliction In his duty and
I. wanted him present when. I said It. I am
now going to ask the Clerk for the personal
property aÂ«:*eFsmÂ«;nt roll for the year.
MIKES >ionrc CHARGES.
County Clerk Cook said that it had not
been turned over to him and Supervisor
Rowe continued: ; ; .- ,
Htre we are sittlnc as. a Board of Eciuall
i zotion trying to pass upon assessments when
w<Â» hayÂ« not got the complete rolls bsfore us.
I for one would like to know what the personal
property of some of these corporations Is as
sessed for. y<=t Dalton. without life or Hcens?.
retains a portion of the assessment rolls which
w e are expected to pass upon. This looks to
me like a piece of raw politics In the year
before election. Dalton now asks the board to
sustain him in his actions, and I say now
that I have been submitting to his actions for
three year* until I am disgusted. If Dalton
would do his work like a business man In
stead of like a faker, and would assess the
county of Alameda equally for about 60 per
cent of Its valuation Instead of playicg to the
gallery, we would have money enough to pay
all oT our bills, and '* thÂ» tax rate would be
ore third leso. -The .conduct of the Assessor
has don*, more, to hurt this county than the
corporations that are trying' to evade paying
taxes. Th<> Assessor Is the- man 'responsible
for the high tax rate In this county. i
"The AÂ«Â«Ff>tw>r: In one ~or his- circulars, says
that the K<>y Route is assessed for about ' 25
per cent of, Ita value. It that Is true hÂ» lv
Vcrelict in his duty" as 'an 'Assessor. I find
here that one of the banks In this city Is
assisted for $130,000 for its property and
building.- while in 1U literature it places
thÂ« value at $250,000. Is that a fair assess
ment? .1 would ljkp' to- examine the-' personal
property - assessment ;of some: of the banks
and corporations, 1 but we. have not, got the
book.'. . . . i
Chief Deputy Assessor Robinson ex
plained ;that the . Assessor has to collect
the personal property, tax. and that in
ordfr to do so, h$ must retain the roll.
OAKLAND, Aug. 3.â Supervisor H. X>.
Rpwe made.an open attack upon County
Assessor Henry P. j_alton at the meeting
of the County Board pf Equalization this,
morning, tho attack being called for.th
by the tight that is being waged over the
assessment of the Oakland Traction Com
pany, the Key Route ferry and railroad
service, and tho Realty Syndicate. â¢.
The attack was a startling one, for in
days gone by Supervisor Rowe and As
sessor Dalton were political frUnds, but
to-day the Supervisor said things in open
(meeting that have set the politicians on
J edge, and made people sit up and look
; around to see what was coming next.
j The Board of Equalization, however,
I did nothing except listen to Supervisor
J Rowe, adopt a resolution embodying some
i of the speech-of Supervisor Rowe against
I Assessor DaKon and some of the press,
1 receive seme petitions and circulars asking
that the assessment of the corporations
in question be not reduced, and then
adjourn. The corporations in question
have not, as yet, asked for any reduction
in assessment. â¢ . . . \u25a0 "
SUPERVISOR GROWS WARM.
' Supervisor Rowe blazed up just after
\the board had got through with some
routine business. A number of long
petitions . that have been in circulation
throughout the county for several days
were presented opposing any reduction in
the assessments of the Realty Syndicate
and its allied railroad and' ferry corpora
tions. Upon this Mr. Rowe presented tlie
following resolutions,- wÂ»..ch were adopted
by the votes of all of the members pres
ent. Supervisor Kelly being absent:
Whereas, It has come to the notice of the
Board of Supervisors sitting &s a Board I of
Equalization of Alameda County, toy peraonal
notices %Jid circulars .and also through th? pub
lio press,- Intimating-. Insinuating and \ even
charging that this board, or individual mem
bers thereof, are being bought, bribed or per
suaded by a certain corporation to reduce its
assessment to .the great detriment of this
county; and
Whereas, The County Assessor and the pub
lic prpss seem to be greatly wrought up for
fear that we are about to commit a great In
justice; and
Whereas, This board wishes once and for
all to allay all fears on that subject, and to
save the unnecessary worry and expens* of
our County Assessor, the pres>s and others,
who are expending their valuable time and
money circularizing the county, and securing
interviews and signatures to letters for pub
lication on matters which have never as yet
been presented for the consideration of this
board, and which, bo far as we know, never
may. be; now therefore be it "
Resolved, That . this board, before taking
final action upon any application presented to
it. will diligently inquire Into the merits of
the request and will be governed In Its final
decision by the evidence introduced before it,
and not Iby any outside pressure or effort to
Intimidate or jam; and be It further
Resolved. That this board deeply regrets the
failure of the Assessor of this county to deltv
<-r the assessment rolls of this county within
the time provided by law. co that a fair op
portunity might have been given to this board
to fully Investigate the assesment of a large
number of ..corporations and Individuals
throughout the county.
While this Was before the board Super
visor Rowe made his speech. He read
"selections from newspaper articles and
.from.-documents that have been in cir
culation . for. some time, and then said
in part:
This board and its members have been
grossly misrepresented. Whether an attempt
has been made to' browbeat and bulldoze the
member* xÂ»t the board Into taking action upon
assessments before an application for a re
duction has-been filed I will leave oth#r6 to
Judge. Up to the present time there has been
no application for a reduction filed by any of j
the corporation Involved, and, as far as I am ;
concerned, I know of no application that will
bes filed, and yet petitions are being filed
j asking us to sustain Dalton'a assessments. A
I San Fc^ncisco paper has gone bo far as to
intimate that I had visited the Realty Syn
dicate to ascertain who was going to handle
I their assessment matters.

All the witnesses In the case of William
F. Hopkins, who Is under $2000 bond on
the charge of stabbing with Intent : to
murder James McGlnley,: have ; been noti
fied by Judge Fritz to report to the Dis
trict . Attorney, who is investigating < the
booking of the defendant for assault to
do great bodily harm Instead of assault
to commit murder.; The "complaint was
yesterday amended to comply with the
latter charge and the case* is set for
hearing next Thursday^ in Judge Fritz's
court. , ; c \u25a0"â¢\u25a0; .. . '
The story goes that Warren Herman,
alias Newman, keeper of a shipping
agency at 26 Steuart street, informed Pa
trolman McGreavy that a sailor aboard
the British ship Battle Abbey was a de
serter from the United States navy; that
McGreavy arrested the mariner, who not
only proved he was no deserter, but em
ployed Vaughn to prosecute Herman, and
tnat Vaughn obtained a warrant for Her
man's arrest, but before presenting It for
Judge Fritz's signature visited Herman
at the latter's residence, on Diamond
street, and notified him of .what had been
done, said visit and notification being ir
regular.
After Herman had complained of
Vaughn's conduct he weakened, and his
wife has been summoned to tell what she
knows about the .incident. Attempt to
extort has been hinted at, and the case
promises to wax In Interest.'
In the office of the Warrant and Bond
Clerk and the court of Judge Fritz there
is agitation over the alleged unprofes
sional conduct of an attorney named
Vaughn.
.Patrolman Prohl testified that the Jap
was recumbent and asleep in a doorway
on Grant avenue, near Pine street, when
Mr. Rose^ "went through him," or, In
other words, searched his pockets and
abstracted therefrom such of the con
tents as were considered desirable. The
harvest was not what the gleaner had
expected it to be, however, for in rage
of disappointment he threw away a few
keys and other worthless things and then
fell to belaboring with feet and hands
the still slumbering victim.
"He was beating the Jap as hard as he
could when I nabbed him," said the po
liceman. "It was the first time I ever
saw a hophead strike any one, and if the
Jap hadn't been too drunk to hit back
I'm sure this fellow wouldn't have at
tacked him."
Mr. Rose was given four months.

fleeted by his sunken and sallow cheeks,
the abnormal dilation of his glittering
eyes, his unkempt person, his shuffling
gait, his ghastly smile of propitiation at
the magistrate. Then the disappointed
cualr warmers settled down to be bored
by another period of the commonplace.
But the case was not altogether devoid
of the unique, for the defendant stood
charged with the offense â most unusual
for a "dope fiend" to commitâ of having
battered a Japanese Inebriate whrfm he
had robbed of several articles of trifling
value.-
In co-operation with the Southern
Pacific Company, which recently added
$100,000 to the fund set aside for ad

Aaoipti K. Harshall, arrested for
speeding an automobile at a forty
mlles-an-hour clip in Golden Gate
Park, declared that the ordinance he
was alleged to have violated conflicted
radically with the laws of the state of
California, from which he quoted most
liberally for the : enlightenment of
Judge Fritz. Patrolman Al Williams,
the complaining witness, also - venti
lated his legal acumen for the benefit
of the court, and his Honor was visibly
impressed by the unexpected competi
tive outpouring of statutory lore.
Mr. Harshall admitted having driven
his auto at a sneed .of twenty mile's an
hour within the park boundaries, but
contended that thereby he did not frac
ture any law of this commonwealth.
The Judge gave himself until to-day to
weigh the- arguments presented by the
rival amateurs.
When he was arrested at midnight
for ringing the doorbell of C. J. Cut
ting's residence. 2099 Bush street, Xor
man Hodgkinson informed the police
man that he was acquainted with a
certain inmate of the domicile with
whom he desired to converse, but every
member of the Cutting family denied
previous knowledge of him.
When placed before Judge Fritz to
answer the charge of peace disturb

In the process of clearing off his cal

the action of the lower^trlbuna! was
sustained and the defendant's bail to
appear for sentence fixed in the sum of

failed to appear for sentence on the day
appointed for that ordeal, and yester

The women were captured in Weinstock,

satchel and Mrs. Grady after stealing
the shirtwaists slipped them to her. In
the eatchel were found four waists,
valued at IS apiece, and another wnist

Scott's dress. At the City Prison the
jounger woman asserted that she was

she had ever accompanied her on any
of her shoplifting trips. Mrs. Grady at

was calling on Mrs. Grady when the two
went forth on their thieving tour. Most

missing wares recently to visit polite
headquarters to-day with a view of asceiv
raining if any of the property belongs to
them. ,
Detectives Wren and Reynolds took
Mre. Nellie Grady, a lodging-house keeper
a-t 2SI Sixth street, and Miss Virginia
Scott, a girl 16 years of age, and a resi

The curests disclosed the fact that the
alder â¢woman was schooling the younger
in the art of shoplirtlng and the latter
was on her first expedition when she was
detected. Hex clumsy work proved her
undoing. A price tag on a silk shirt
waist that had just been Btolen hung out
side a handgrip in which it hod been
secreted. One of the clerks noticed it
and the women were detained.
After the prisoners had been locked up
in the City Prison the detectives searched
Mrs. >Grady's room in her lodging-house
and recovered about $500 worth of stolen
property. There were expensive silk
skirts, waists, gowns and underwear in
abundance. Also silverware, coats, mink

Cloves, bric-a-brac, satchels, card cases,
pictures, btads, clocks and almost every

After she had been with me several
days I said to her, 1 will stir up a
fruit-cake, but I want you to attend
to the baking of it. Bake the cake,

affairs, made of metal of son* kind,
that hung on the kitchen wall.
" 'Sure, Mum.' Nora replied.
"I went upstairs, took my sewing,
and soon the hum of the sewing ma
chine broke the stillness. After a
while my nostrils were assailed by a
most peculiar odor. I sniffed the at
mosphere, trying- to determine what
the smell might be. for sometimes
trash was thrown into the furnace.
along with the coal. It smelled neither
like burning rags, paper nor rubber. I.
threw down my sewing and hastened
to the kitcnen.
"'What Is burning. NoraT I ex
claimed.
" 'Faith, Mum, It must be the clock,'
she replied.
"'The clock! What do you mean?*
"Nora oDened the oven door, dis
closing the cake and what was left of
the clock 'side by each.' I grabbed the
coal scuttle and hurriedly raked it Into
the smelly mess.
" "What on earth. Nora," I demanded,
'made you put the clock In the oven?
Are you crazy?*
â " 'Crazy, is it?* she made answer In
tones that a tragedy queen might have
envied, 'and I Just a-followin* your or

"Yes?"
"Yes, one of these fragile, undulat

"Then you have seen her, have you?"
"No, but I have it on good authority
that she says that she does not believe
in surf-bathing In the presence of

ii p VERY man in this world," said
\Zi the Malt Philosopher, "has some
niche into which he is prepared to
fit as perfectly and smoothly as a round
peg fits into its round hole."
"I don't know about that," said the
man who was not a Malt Philosopher.
"Well, you bet I do."
"How do you account, then, for the
men who buck their luck \ all the way
through life and never seem to find any
place where they fit?"
"Why, the dern fools don't know their
niche when they see it, and bo they keep
on trying to fit a round peg into a square
hole, or a square peg into a round hole."
"Well, you are only supposing that
there is a niche into which they would
fit."
"Not by a dum sight."
"Whare's your proof, then?"
"Don't they all find a hole at last In
which they fit so well that they stay
there permanently?"
All that the man who was not a Malt
Philosopher said was, "Ahâ yesâ l see."
You will understand that I here concede
You have but to see, and you do the deed;
You do not palter and falter, delay,
And wish that you had some time to-day;
You do not sneak,
While your knees turn weak
And you throttle the word that you
ought to speak.
In fact, you are really superior chaps.
And you do the thing that you shouldâ
perhaps;
You do not wait for to-morrow's sun.
As I grieve to state I have frequently
done;
You knuckle right down and tho thing
you do
When you see that old Right needs a
shove or two.
Ah well, I am proud
To be allowed
This tribute to pay to the stalwart crowd.
Which, of course, Includes youâ and you â
and you, c
And all, save myself, of tne human crew,
Orâ that isâ nearly,
For I see clearly
You are not like myself, who act so
queerly;
And this screed's written to speak re
gret . -
That I'm not like youâ that Is. as yet.
But to-morrowâ to-morrowâ Ah well, I
say!
You chaps.
You should never smile when I talk this
way â
That is, perhaps.
rnp HERE'S many a thing that I ought
I to dp,
'1 And I know right well they are need
ed, too.
There's the brave, true word that
should straisrht be said.
The word that a coward alone would
dread;
There's the stalwart deed
" For the great world's need, ,
Refusal to walk with the dastard breed;
There's a place right here and now, I see,
Where my note would make for the har
mony
That the Maker of all doth surely know
Out of life's discord at last shall grow.
Ah yes, there is room for. a stalwart
deed
Wherever black Wrong has muttered his
creed;
For the Truth to seek;
To stand, not sneak.
Nor cunningly ask if the Right is weak.
Good faith, there is much that my hand
may do,
And I'll taka much pleasure In doing It,
tooâ ,
That is, to-morrow,
For I note with sorrow
That the time from to-day I cannot bor
row
To speak the word and do the deed
That would brighten and lighten the gray
world's need;
But, of course, it isn't the same with you.
You chapa
To-day do the thing that you ought to
do-
That is, perhaps.

The.crisis is upon us. The forces are aligned for battle. The struggle is
unavoidable. \ Will the people shirk? The grafters will not shirk. They may
be depended upon to go to the primary at -the head of the embattled vices of
the city. What will embattled virtue arid decency do ?
r TP*HE fate of San Francisco will soon be known. The Republican League
has projected and perfected its organization in every district in the city.
A It has appreciated the fact that in protecting the ballot-box against fraud
it must provide its own safeguards. The city administration, controlling ,the
lawful means to do so, uses them for an. unlawful purpose or compels a nega
tive attitude that means winking at crime and doing nothing to prevent it. .
The League, with only a small part of the public agencies at its disposal,
has supplemented them by a complete organization. Its detective facilities are
fully equipped. Ballot-box stuffers and sophisticators of the registry list may
not be prevented by the police in carrying out their schemes, but they may be
sure of one thing, they will have to face a Grand Jury and plead to an indict
ment for their crimes, and before a petit' jury face the fate that overtook trie
stuffers at last year's primary.
But, with every safeguard wisely in action, it must not be forgotten that
the fate of the city depends upon every man doing his duty by casting his legal
ballot in the interest of law, order and decency, and against^raft, graft, greed and
corruption. A large majority of our peopld want a decent and upright city
government. The public conscience is awakened to the evils of municipal
government. Even Philadelphia stirs uneasily in her sleep and seeks to escape
a bondage endured so long that it seemed a permanent and legitimate condition.
San Francisco, with high hopes, adopted the present charter in the belief
that it automatically safeguarded the government, Now the unpleasant dis
covery is made that its safeguards in evil hands protect every form of political
offense and governmental impropriety possible to public authority. History
does not furnish another equally flagrant instance of the utter perversion of the
purpose of a fundamental law. As in the case of all such perversions, the effect
has been injurious to the interests and galling to the pride of the city. The
scribbling apologists of the administration have scattered broadcast their
syndicated excuses and their combined attacks upon the element that demands
an end of these offenses.
In all of these elaborate defenses the members of the city government
are treated as the only parties having any rights in the premises and the people
are studiously ignored. Entrenched in power to misuse it, the agencies of
infamous misgovernment are treated as if they had chartered rights for misrule
and graft is glorified with legitimacy.
These syndicated apologists are not the only proofs of the existence of a
system abhorrent in all of its features. The efforts of the press, the Republi
can League and the Grand Jury have added evidence that should quicken th<f
local patriotism of every citizeri who does not enjoy blushing for his city. If
such citizens default at the primary, if they are too busy or too indifferent to
attend to the sole duty of that day, they must take what comes and not complain.
If they fail in their duty joy will thrill the whole kingdom of graft and the con
victed ballot-box stuffers, who are expiating their crimes in the State prison, will
be jocund because they will be justified.
When so much that is offensive in the city administration is known it must
not be supposed that all is known. Below the * exposed surface lie strata \)f.
crime and transgression successfully concealed by those in power who are its
abettdrs and its beneficiaries. If the chastening rod of correction is used at
the primary and the. enemies of decency are put on the run, what is now covert
and concealed will be uncovered and disclosed.
St. Louis went on for years as San Francisco is -now going on. One day
AAr. Folk struck a blow at what was superficial and apparent. Decency rallied
to his support. Public officers took the alarm. They shaved their beards and
ran. Tens of thousands of dollars, the proceeds of graft and bribery, sneaked
out Qf hiding. Men in a panic, to save themselves from stripes, gave up the
story of corruption.
The courts were kept busy and the jails were filled with officials who had
before known them only as a means of graft and theft, of which the taxpayers
were the sufferers. By taking a bold stand Mayor Weaver of Philadelphia, in a
night, struck down the criminal courage of the robbers of that city, and each
one thought only of his personal safety, to be secured by exposing his partners
In San Francisco reform does not depend upon one man. It depends upon
all the voters who are impressed by its necessity. The legions of decency,
marching to the primary^ polls, casting lawful ballots and then standing guard
for one day, can do here what one man had to do in St. Louis and one man in
Philadelphia. The conscience of this city is quickened, but its late awakening
is futile unless it is transmuted into action.
This is a commercial community, but its people are concerned in other
things than buying cheap and selling dear. . There is commerce here in the sa
cred things of government as well as the -standard articles of merchandise.
These merchants in the profits of immorality ,.vice and crime, these defilers of
public authority, will never quit until they are scourged out of power.
If v they gain immunity at the primary they will use their license to mis
govern. No doubt about that. They have caused all the past governments by
boss rule, bad as they were, to be looked upon as the golden age of the city
compared with what we have now. If by their own craft and the indifference
of the people they get another lease of power, who can blame them for
using it? a ...'â¢â¢ v " : \u25a0 -
NOW FOR THE PRIMARY.
THE SMART SET
SALLY SHARP
BURBANK ON STIRPICULTURE.
IT is announced, at second hand, that Mr. Burbank, whose service
to the world -in plant improvement has made him a foremost
benefactor of mankind, has in view the application of his science
to. children, with a view of making man perfect, physically and
morally. The question of stirpiculture has before this occupied the
attention of physiologists and biologists. But it was one wiser
than the rest who, in discussing juvenile reformation and perfec
tion, said that the only way to reform a boy and make^him perfect
was by beginning with his grandfather.
In'developing plants and getting a higher quality of usefulness
out of those already subjected to the use of man, and' in directing
weeds out of their 'class 'into the useful class, Mr. Burbank begins
with the grandfathers, and even with more remote generations of
trie plant he is treating and guiding to a higher life. He cannot
in one season, in one generation, turn a white lily yellow, nor make
a seedless prune, nor a walnut that grows like Jack's beanstalk.
It is the patient work of many seasons, upon many generations, and
by careful' selection on a definite line that these marvels are
wrought.
The same is true in the breeding of cattle and other domestic
animals. A cart horse cannot be changed into a flier. This has to
be done by careful selection, maintained through many generations.
Differentiation has to be carefully watched. By watching we have
differentiated the original dog (probably it was a jackal) into the
immense St. Bernard, the shaggy terrier, the tiny King Charles
spaniel, and the large number of breeds, each with its different ca
pacities and characteristics. Labor would have been wasted in try
ing to turn the original one dog into an Irish setter or a bench
legged Dachshund. The beginning was many generations back, and
many grandfathers had to be studied and moved along just a little in
the desired direction.
. In all these differentiations of animal and plants the subject
was entirely in the control of man. Whole generations of plants
were pulled up, killed and thrown aside, and one was preserved.
In perfecting neat cattle whole generations went to the butcher,
except a few favored individuals that were saved for the transmis
sion of the desired traits. Whole litters of puppies were sent to
the millpond except one or two that promised results. By pro
longed patience and by the sacrifice of the unfit, results were ob
tained.
Who shall be bold enough to say that man can be subjected
to the same processes? Regard for individual freedom forbids it.
What we call civilization began with man uncounted generations
away. It has dealt with the grandfathers, but has not yet perfected
the grandsons. Families righteous through many generations have
finally produced individuals of the worst sort. Atavism- has worked
its- way, because, unlike plants and animals, man cannot be sub
jected to the will of the stirpiculturisL
The law of human advancement is a subtle statute that man
cannot read. It was so from the beginning. The first family had
in it only one blameless member and he was murdered by his
brother. The second genesis of the race made a bad start and the
righteous Lot was surrounded by events which now would send
somebody to the penitentiary. In view of these things, it must be
admitted that the human race is running very well, and from a bad
start is doing as well as can be expected.
If Mr. Burbank believe that limitation of crime and relief of
poverty in this generation is likely to produce better results in the
next he is entirely right, and that is just what society is trying
all the time to do. If he or any one can direct its efforts more wisely
and to greater effectiveness that direction is needed. Plants and
animals we can drive. But man must be led. He will not be
driven. We cannot even confine the transmission of life to the
fittest morally and physically. The effort to make all more fit is. a.
noble occupation for the philanthropist. We are persuaded that
every year it enlists the energies and devotion of more people, and
that on the whole, considering the perversity of man, the race is
progressing satisfactorily.
The effort of Barnardo. in London in training waif children has
succeeded with a large percentage of those who have been in his
care. But in plants and animals selection and training fix a type
which is preserved by absolutely controlling the transmission of
life. In the absence of this control it is impossible to fix a type in
man and secure its transmission, making it permanent. The dog
will go back through mongrelism to the original type. The plant
will become a weed and neat kine degenerate to the type of their
shaggy ancestors, unless controlled. Man, insusceptible to control,
will lose in the next generation the characteristics trained into him
in this.
To do what Mr. Burbank suggests is a very high ideal, a most
worthy purpose, but as it failed, according to the old story, with
the first family and with the second, we must expect that the race
will go on producing the good, indifferent and bad, as it began.
Above all the apparently changeless scene presides the law of
evolution, under which, in nature's slow time and way, the earth
may be entirely unpeopled of the forms of life that now are, and
others â¢ will succeed, as these followed the great creatures whose
fossil remains tell the story of the slow changes that are wrought
by environment.

Love's romance was ended for James
Galloway at 1500 Kentucky street yes
terday morning. An open gas key and
the room full of the suffocating fluid
revealed the cause of death. Galloway
was 2S years old and had been em
ployed in the Union Iron Works as a
machinist's helper. He had reported
among his friends, notably Fred Rlcomi,
his landlord, that he was engaged to
be married to Miss Lena Kendal. who
is employed in the Buffalo Hotel on
Sixth street, near Brannun. and that
the lady had $500 of his money, which
she was keeping for him. Whether
they had a quarrel or not Is not known,
but Galloway had been .drinking
heavily ever since last Sunday and he
was intoxicated when he went to his
room last Wednesday night. He waa
found lying on the floor near his bed
fully dressed, with the exception of his
coat.

Dr. O'Connell, to whom Papandre Is
alleged to have given the questions and
auvwers, swore as follows ln his signed
affidavit made on the first Saturday
{ after the examinations were given t
"On Tuesrtny, June 13, 1003, I saw Dr.
Dunn, who was talking to an applicant
for a license. I have since been
informed that his name is Richard D.
Papandre. "The conversation between
him and Dr. Dunn took place In the
small hallway on the ground floor of
the building In which the examinations
took place. I went Into the examina
tion rooms and immediately upon said
applicant' coming Into the room and
taking bis seat I said to. him. 'What
did you get â pass It out,' nnd the appli
cant fcald 'Define what is osteology.'
He then proceeded to define it. Then
he told me what the second question
was and what was the answer to it,
what the third question was and what
the answer was and then put another
question to me In a little different form,
which be told that he (Dunn) could
not answer. I then' asked said appli
cant bow he did It, meaning how be
got the Information, and he said that
Dr. Dunn was a friend of bis.
"GEORGE D. O'CONNELL/'
DID NOT LIKE TO TESTIFY.
Dr. Papandre, however, was a disap
pointment to the "solid five" when he
took the stand. He did not want to
give his testimony and he could not
Eeem to remember some of the things
which he swore to in the affidavit. He
would only state positively yesterday
that Dr. Dunn had given him the first
question that appeared ln Dr. Mayhew's
examination, and he did not remember
having told O'Connell that he ha*d ob
tained the questions direct from this
source. Papandre told the commission
that he did not attend the University
of California, but that he had assisted
Dr. Dunn in the latter's office and had
there gained a practical knowledge of
dentistry. Dr. Dunn and he were very
friendly. "I was not impressed at. the
time of the examination," he said,
"with the similarity of the questions
given me by Dr. Dunn and those on the
board, except in the first one. That I
did receive, but I regard it as a coin
cidence and not ah evidence of fraud.
Dunn stood back of my chair and spoke
to me once, but I did not hear what he
said to me."
Dr. O'Connell was the star witness
for the faction to which Dr. Mayhew
belongs, the "solid five." He gave in
every detail the conversation that he
had with Pap&ndre during which the
latter gave him the questions and told
him the answers. His evidence was
what cast the suspicion on Dr. Dunn,
although it ln no way explained the set
of questions which Dr. Lew Smith said
were the "real dope."
PAPANDRE GIVES ANSWERS.
"I saw Dr. Dunn on Tuesday. June
18." the witness stated. "Immediately
before the anatomy examination I en
tered the bunding with Flood and Mi
nor. As we passed through a small
way my attention was called to Papan/
dre and Dr. Dunn talking In the little
hall. Dr. Dunn held a paper in his
hand. 1
"1 sat down and Papandre -entered.
When he sat down next to me I asked
him what he*got. and to come through
with It. He then gave me some ques
tions and Rome answers. I asked him
where he got it and he told me that
Dunn was his friend and had told film
the Questions, and that one of them
Dunn did not know the answer to. Dr.
Minor was there and he -received the
benefit of this. Then Dr. Mayhew be
gan to write the questions on the.
board and we had to stop talking.
"I kept still about what I knew because
I did not want to get" mixed up In a fac
tional war which I had heard /was going
on within the board. Especially did I not
want to ret Into any friction because 1
was a- candidate for a degree. The fact
that I had this information was given to
the board by Dr. Minor, and' Dr. Baird
came to me and asked me to sign an affi
davit telling all that I had .seen and
heard. I dJd not want to do this and at
flrst refused, but Dr. Baftd urged me to
Furthermore the "solid five," through
their attorney, "Walter S. Braun, say
that they will introduce other witnesses
and other affidavits to firmly intrench
this accusing information. One of
these witnesses, Dr. Minor, a member
of the jecent graduating class from
the University of California, will be put
on the stand at nine o'clock this morn
ing. He is alleged to have heard Pa
pandre give the questions which seem
to entwine Dr. Dunn into the muss.
The other. Dr. Flood, is not now in San
Francisco, but on his arrival he will be
brought before the commission at once.
SWEARS DUXN GAVE QUESTIONS.
The affidavit of Dr. Papandre is giv
en in part as follows: "Before I saw
examination I had a conversation with
Dr. J. M. Dunn in hal\way of the ex
amination rooms. In all, my best recol
lection is that he suggested three or
four questions to me and Informally
gave me the answers to them. Dr.
Dunn knew that I had been preparing
for these examinations for three
or four months past because I nad told
him so. (Signed) Richard D. Papandre.
No. 58."
This young man is Dr. Richard D.
Papandre nnd he says In a sworn affi
davit that he was given three or four
questions by bis employer, a member
of the State board. To back this testi
mony up the solid five introduced Dr.
George D. O'Connell, who stated before
the commission yesterday afternoon
that Papaudre gave him these questions
a few minutes before the examination
and that four of them were embodied in
the questions written -on the board by
Dr. Ma j hew. He, too, had made an
affidavit swearing to these facts. By
this evidence the black hand of sus
picion is made to turn from Dr. May
hew, the first accused, and point slowly
in the direction of Dr. Dunn.
A complete surprise was sprang in
the investigation of the alleged irregu
lar actions of the State Dental Board
yesterday afternoon when those mem
bers of the board known as the "solid
five" â Drs. A. B. Mayhew, C. A. Her
rick, G. A. White. E. J. Howard and F.
G. Balrdâ brought forward testimony
whlch directly accused Dr. J. 31. Dunn,
one of the opposing faction in the
board, with giving out some of the
questions in anatomy to a young man
ln his employ who was about to take
the test so that he could apply for a
dfentist's license.

sented."
"Do you know whether you have passed
the examinations?" asked Commissioner
Cromwell.
COMPARISOX OP QUESTIONS.
"Dr. Coke told me that I did," was the
reply from O'Connell. This is the Market
street dental firm member who. it is said,
has given the information to many of the
graduates whether or not they were suc
cessful.
"Did he tell you who told him?"
"He did not," answered O'Connell, "but
I inferred that it was the minority mem
bers of the board" (Drs. Dunn and Cool).
The questions which O'Connell swears
were given to him ] by Dr. Papandre
just before the examination as coming
from Dr. Dunn are strikingly like

STORY PROVES A SENSATION*.
The giving of, O'Connell's testimony
produced a sensation in the room of the
commission. Up to this time the inves
tigation had proved to bo featureless, but
when O'Connell took the stand the crowd
; of students and graduates in the room
pressed forward so as not to miss a syl
lable of what waa said. Attorney Braun
had promised a sensation for yesterday
afternoon, and he made good, his promise.
O'Connell's words sounded with a sharp
i distinctness that lent a tragic atmosphere
! to the occasion. Dr. Dunn, evidently sur
prised, sat staring at the witness. The
"solid five" beamed with the pleasure
that they were enjoying at his discom
fiture.
DU.W DENIES ACCUSATIONS.
Dr. Dunn denies that he crave the
questions to Papandre. "I warn only
Joking; with him and gave him one josh
question that is common for us dentists
to pans to a young; student. I am not
Kullty of having; given awn.r the ques
tions. Nor do I believe that Dr. May
hew did It. Of course I have not heard
all the testimony, but I believe that all
the questions which the boys had Were
general ones and that there Tras no
Irregularity at all. Dr. Cool had his
suspicions because of the. decided simi
larity between the real examination
questions and the list obtained in ad
vance by Dr. Smith."
The morning session of the commission
yesterday was featureless. Many of the
recent graduates were examined to show
the amount of applause that was given
"Dr. Mayhew on his appearances before
them on different occasions. Fraternity
affairs claimed a considerable part of the
discussion and fraternity jealousy was
alleged by several to have been at the
bottom of much of the trouble in the
State board. Several more students were
examined who had been told that they
had successfully passed the examina
tions. The same Dr. Coke was their in
formant, although not one knew whence
he got his authority to talk. -

Miss I. E. Connor, milliner, of 138 Geary
street, has removed to 223 Post street. â¢
The Italian -Swiss colony has en
gaged iii an enterprise that promises
great benefit for the California wine
industry. The plan is to bottle in New
York the good California wine and in
troduce it in the market under Califor
nia labels. In this the colony and the
California Wine Association are pur
euing the same policy.
P. C Rossi went to New York last
week at the request of representatives
of the New York house of the Italian-
Pwi&s colony and he has leased a lot at
the corner of Washington and West
Eleventh streets, 90x130 feet In size,
for fifteen years for a total rental for
the term of $200,000. The lease was
made with contract that a six-otory
building with basement shall be erect
ed. The structure, according to A.
t-barboro. will cost at least $160,000.
In the building will be the offices of
the colony, wine vaults and storage ca
pacity. It is proposed now to have a
large bottling department ln New York,
where California wines shall go out
%Â£ith a. California label, the purpose be
icg to give all wine ; purchasers a
chance to get California wine and to
tecure all the credit that belongs to
this State In the matter. By this the
fame of the California vintages will be
established and the market will be ex
tended.
Heretofore California wines have
been sold ln New York under foreign
labels end poor wines manufactured in
the Eastern States have been given
California labels. The effect has been
bad for California. Mr. Sbarboro 6ays
that this State is capable of producing
as much wine and as good wines as
France. At this time France has an
annual wine consumption of 1.01)0,000,
000 gallons with a population of about
40,000,000, and this brings in $300,000,
000 a year.
The United States has more than
double the population of France but
consumes only about 50,000,000 gallons
a year. Properly fostered, the demand
for California wines will equal in vol
ume the demand for French wines, Mr.
Sbarboro says. The Italian-Swiss col
ony will do its best to promote thÂ«
California wine Industry in Xew York
;ind other Eastern centers of popula
tion.

Longs opinion continues thus:
The attachment so levitd upon said proper
ties was jirlcr In limj to ail other -attach
ments, of which I am informed there were a
number issued immediately thereafter. On
June 16, ISKIS. my attention having been
called by the National Sumy Company to
some :u,(\> shares of stock in the Pacific Jupiter
Steel Company, standing upon the books of
fa id company in the name of K. J. Smith, an
attachment was levied en such ..stock. The
seme course was taken in reier?nce to 200
shares of stock of the Southern Pacific Com-
NO ACTION TAKEN YET.
No action has as y.et keen taken against the
National Surety Company, the eurety com
pany appearing upon the official bond given by
Smith, as Tax Collector,- in the sum of $100,000
as required by the provisions of section 2 of
article XV of the charter. The assuranc-d
given by the officers of this company at the
time the defalcation was discovered that
prompt payment would be made of the amount
found to be due encouraged the belief that .no
action at law would be necessary to collect
auch amount.
The demand on the surety company to
make good the $51,672 8S may be regarded as
necessarily preliminary to the institution of
legal proceedings for the recovery of the
amount due, should the city and county of San
Francisco b* compelled to resort to such ac
tion. In the event of the refusal or neglect
of the surety company to pay the amount, the
Mayor should at once Inform this office, and
instruct the City Attorney to commence an
action.
Mayor Schmitz stated that he would
Immediately follow the advice and
make written demand on the surety
company for the full amount of Smith's
defalcation.
SHORTAGE MADE GOOD.
Relative to the liability of City
Treasurer McDougald for the $15,590 08
paid out on Smith's personal check.
Long refers to the notification received
that McDougald had returned the full
amount to the city treasury, and says:
"There is no doubt; that the Treasurer
is liable for the sum paid out by his
deputy on E. J. Smith's check. "With
regard to sections 424 and 425 of the
Penal Code, however, I am of the opin
ion that they must be read in connec
tion with section 20 of the same code,
which provides that in every cr|me or
public offense there must exist a un
ion or Joint operation of act and Intent.
Accepting your statement that in your
opinion there was no guilty intent, I
consider that the Treasurer must be
held guiltless of intentional violation
of the penal statutes."
Replying to the Mayor's query as to
his duty relative to the payment of
$9935 70 as attorney's fees for collec
tion of collateral inheritance taxes and
McDougald's holding out of $5273 15
claimed as his commission for collect
ing such tax. Long says:
NOT ENTITLED TO FEES.
"I hold in view of certain decisions
on the point that in no event Is the
Treasurer entitled to retain the com
missions attempted to be allowed him
by section 20 of the said act to his own
use. On the contrary, such commis
sions belong to the municipality and so
far as they have accrued prior to the
amendment of February, 1903, herein
after considered, they should be paid
into the treasury to the credit of the
unappropriated fee fund, if such pay
ment has not been made.
"I hold that section 20 & of the act
of 1903 Js constitutional and authorizes
the Treasurer to appoint and compen
sate special counsel .for services ren
dered in the collection of collateral In
heritance taxes, in an amount not ex
ceeding the percentages named in sec
tion 20 of the act. The'tax imposed
owes its existence entirely to this act.
It is a direct tax . imposed by State
authority upon the bequests, devises
and transfers named In the act and Is
ln no manner dependent upon municipal
action for its imposition. Not only Is
it imposed directly by the State but It
is payable, to the State."
Startling testimony introduced yesterday afternoon by the
"Solid Five" of the Dental Board in the investigation now
being conducted by a State commission seems to point the
black hand of suspicion at Dr. J. . M. Dunn, member of the
minority faction in the board. He is accused of having given
out questions similar to those in the anatomy examination to
his assistant, Dr. Papandre, who told them to afellow student.

Four Facts For
Sick Women
To Considez
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound
Has an Unequalled Record of Cures â
Mrs. 'Pinkbam's Advice Is Conftden>
fiat. Free, and always Helpful
First. â That almost every operation
in our hospitals performed upon women
becomes necessary through neglect of
such symptoms as backache, irregular
and painful menstruation, leucorrhcea,
displacement* of the uterus, pain in
the side, bnrnlng sensation in the stom-
ach, bearing-down pains, nervousness,
dizziness and sleeplessness.
SECOND.â The medicine that holds
the record for the largest number of
absolute cures of female ills is Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
It .regnlates, strengthens and cures
diseases of the female organism as
nothing else can.
For thirty years it has been helping
women to be strong, curing backache,
nervousness, kidney troubles, all uter-
ine and ovarian inflammation, weak-
ness and displacements, regulating
menstruation perfectly and overcom-
ing its pains. It has also proved itself
invaluable in preparing for childbirth
and the change of life.
Tothd.â The great volume of unso-
licited and grateful testimonials on file
at the Pinkham Laboratory at Lynn,
Mass., many of which are from time to
time published by permission, give ab-
solute evidence of the value of Lydia
K. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound and
Mrs. Pinkhairfs advice.
Focp.th. â Every ailing woman in the
United States is asked to accept the
following invitation. It is free, will
bring you health and may save your
life.
\ Mrs. Pinkham's Standing Invitation
to Women.- Women suffering from any
form of female weakness are invited to
promptly communicate with Mrs. Pink-
ham. at Lynn, Mass. All letters are
received, opened, read and answered
by women only. From symptoms given,
your trouble may be located and the
quickest and surest way of recovery
advised. Out of the vast volume of ex-
perience in treating female ills Mrs.
Pinkham probably has the very knowl-
edge' that will help your case. Surely,
any woman, rich or poor, is very foolish
if she does not take advantage of Uum
generous offer of p^jfjt-? T i<*Ot
Save the Babies.
INFANT MOBTAIITY is something frightful We can hardly realize that of -
all the children horn in civilized oountries, twentytwo per cent., or nearly
one-quarter, die hefore they reach one year; thirtyseven per cent, or moro
than one-third, hefore they are five, and one-half hefore they are fifteen!
We do not hesitate to say that a timely use of Oastoria would save a ma-
jority of these precious lives. Neither do we hesitate to say that many of these
infantile deaths are occasioned hy the use of narcotic preparations. Drops, tinctures
and soothing syrups sold for children's complaints contain more or less opium, or
morphine. They are, in considerable quantities, deadly poisons. In any quantity
they stupefy, retard circulation and lead to congestions, sickness, death.. Oastoria
operates exactly the reverse, but you must see that it hears the signature of
j Ohas. H. Fletcher. Oastoria causes the blood to circulate properly, opens the
pores of the skin and allays fever.

In the second heat, McDonald had Sweet
Marie right on her stride and went away
with Tiverton at a whirlwind gait. For
a few strides the mare showed in front
and then the gelding forged ahead, lead
ing at the quarter, by a length. This time
McDonald made his drive earlier, reach
ing Tiverton at the three-quarters. From
there to the .wire was witnessed one of
the mqst desperate finishes ever seen on
a traclt. The 6000 spectators in the grand
stand were aroused to the highest pitch
of excitement, and when Sweet Marie
flashed under the wire a winner by a
neck the applause was . deafening \and
continued until the driver had dismounted
and weighed in. Time, 2:04*4: ;
In tha third and final heat .Tiverton
rushed to the front, but Sweet Marie
yokefi him on . the lower turn. Howell
pushed ' Tiverton to the \u25a0 distance post.
Then he realized that he was beaten and
considerably eased his horse, the mare
Jogging home a winner by an open
length. Time, 2:0 C%.
The time of the- three heats' was, with
the exception of Cresceus-The Abbott
race, at Brighton Beach, the fastest ever
trotted. Jn the opinion of experienced
horsemen" the time made to-day, was su
perior, as The Abbott was withdrawn
after the second heat and Cresceus went
the mile accompanied by a runner for a
pacemaker. Summary:
Match race, trot, pursa $5000â Sweet Marie
won second and third heats and race. Tiver
ton won first hÂ»>at. Time by. quarters:
First heatâ :32.' l:o3%. 1:34%; 2:05%.
Second heat â :31U. l:02Â»i, $1:33%- - 2:04%.
Third heatâ :32 1:03%. 1:31%, 2:06%
vine track, and when the contest of
epÂ«eed ended the honors were awarded
to the Pacific slope. In one of the finest
speed contests ever seen on any race
course, Sweet Marie defeated Tiverton
two out of three heats, thereby winning
for her owner, William Garland, of Los
Angeles', a purse of JS(KX).
It was 2:20 when Alta McDonald, be
hind Sweet Marie, and John Howell, with
Tiverton, appeared for the first heat,
the latter getting the pole on the toss.
After tv.o preliminary scores all was in
readiness, and the first time down they
got the v.ord, with Tiverton a saddle
girth in the lead. This advantage he in
creased until he swung down the stretch
for home, when Sweet, Marie reached his
wheel, but the gilding won handily by
half a length. Sweet Marie was undef
a hard drive. The time, 2:05%, was the
trotting record of the year, beating that
of Dr. Strone at Detroit last week by
half a second.

WhÂ«Â»n Jirr.mle Gardner of Lowell,
Mass-., and Rufe Turner of Stockton
: hook \:p to-ni.srht at Colnia onÂ« of the
bePt battles of the season between
lightweights is fissured.^ It will be
Gardners first ap;>eararce in a Cali
fornia ring, and will also mark the
initial attempt of the black whirlwind
to subdue a high-grade boxer in the
vicinity of this city. x
The men are to box twenty-five
rounds at ISS pounds at â¢) o'clock. The
battle wil! be referred by Billy Roche.,
the ofÃcial judge of the Golden State
Athlttic Association, under whos?
auspiefs the jrjill will be fought. All
indications point to a knockout within
a short period, for both men are hard
punchers and Quick to take advantage
of an opening.
In the br-tting: last right Turner ruled
a 10 to 9 favorite over the man from
the Bay State; but it ie expected that
the heaviest wagering will be done to
day, as the admirers of both men
seemed to be holding out for better
odds. The fight looks like an cven
money proposition, but still the tvis3
brigade is looking for the best of the
price..
Turner did all his training near hi*
home- In Stockton. Last night he went
to bed well under weight. The black
cm worked harder for this go than
he was ever known to labor before,
.\u25a0and lack of condition can never stand
as an excuse if lie falls to bring back
the- coin. Turner will arrive in this
city this afternoon on a special train,
J which bears the members of Stockton's
â¢porting fraternity.
Gardner's work has been done at
Larkspur, where he trained under the
watchful eyes of his brother George and !
â¢Smiling Metzner. The Lowell boy is a
bit rangier than Turner.* and therefore
the wtight was not co easy for him.
But he managed to take it all off dur
ing the last few days, end will tip the
beam this evenirlg well under the re-
Qulred notch, for he retired last night
a couple of pounds to the good.
The figrhU will start early, and there
will be no unnecessary delay. As the
management expects an immense crowd
at the ringside, many additional spe
cial cars have been arranged for, so
that the patrons will be well taken
care of and landed back In this city
: before midnight. i

The Commuters never pulled off a bet
ter rally in their existence than the one
that came to pass in the ninth spasm
yesterday afternoon, as the various men
grabbed their bats, then continued one
I after another to line 'em out and chasfc
over the sacks. Before the Galnts could
.' realize what was coming off, Oakland
j had clouted three men past the line and
bade their opponents a pleasant evening.
The hardened fan would not have given
a last year's rain check for Oakland's
chances in the ninth, when ' the Giants
were leading 4 to 2 and the game seemed
In. But Old Rip Van Haltren started
the doings with a pretty bunt and Dun
lea vy beat a slow one to Atz. While the
Portland infield was playing catch, Van
sneaked around to third.
Along came Kruger with a smash into
the right garden, putting Van through
with the first tally. Baby McLean tried
to wing a fast one and catch Dunleavy
at second, but the peg was wide and Dun
tore in with the second. Kruger got as
far as second. He quickly stole third and
when Hogan responded with a drive over
Van Buren's head, all the fans went
; home.
There was lots of lively hitting sand
wiched in between those nine rounds of
action. Smiling Schmidt was wild after
his sojourn in the bushes and did not
pitch as good ball as he might. | Corbett
was a very lucky young man, for the
Commuters were getting men on the bases
right along, but they all seemed to stick
till the big rally was pulled off in the
ninth spasm. ;
They each made a run in the first two
innings, but the Giants icame through
with three in the fourth, and it looked
bad for Oakland. Runkle showed the way
by getting a life on Kruger's fumble and
Corbett hammered one safe to left. Mc-
Creedie unloaded another two bagger to
center and Runkle arrived. When Flem
ing dispatched his second liner out to left,
both McCreedie and Corbett chased them
selves over the rubber, making it 4 to 1
in Portland's favor.
Oakland grabbed another in the seventh
! on a couple of hits, but it did not look
as If they had a chance to bring home
the money till the rally happened. Con
rad, the former catcher for the soldier's
baseball nine at the Presidio, has been
signed by the Giants and will be seen
in action in a few days. The score:

OAMUS TO-DAY.
BUFFALO, Aug. 3. â The racing across
the river to-day was rather marked for
its placidity and smoothness, not an in
cident of any kind out of the ordinary
occurring-. The track and weather oon
ditlons were perfect. A handicap at a
mile and an eighth was the principal
feature and was won , by Our Bessie, \
who set a new track record for the
distance, covering it in 1:53.
. Hans Wagner was an equal favorite
with Bishop Pool's Baikal and the race
was between these two for the first
mile with Hans Wagner in the lead.
When they straightened out for home.
Our Bessie put on a full head of steam I
I and, catching the other two in the clos-
I ing strides, won ridden out. by a length.

CHICAGO, Aug. 3.â Gamblers, intent
I upon playing the races, and policemen,
determined to prevent ail race track bet
ting on the high seas, furnished to-day
on Lake Michigan a unique' and spec
tacular gambling raid. The police and
gamblers raced around the lake, first
| Into Michigan waters, then close to .the
1 shores of Illinois, and then into the juris
. diction of Indiana, the one seeking es-
I cape and the police determined to cap-
I ture them. The net lesults of the day for
' the police were the capture of fourteen
' weary marine gamblers who floated
ashore at South Chicago in a launch. All
of the others, after a hot chase by the
police in a lumbering fire tug, escaped
to Indiana Harbor, Ind., and made their
way ashore outside of the Jurisdiction of
the Chicago police,
' Chief of Police Collins said to-day he
'would no longer permit the operation of
'the floating poolroom City of Traverse.
" He asserted that he would arrest all the
j gamWers when they attempted to board
' it, claiming that they were about to com
mit an Illegal act, which brought them
within police Jurisdiction. The gamblers
circumvented the, Chief of Police at the
outset. by causlng\the steamer City of
Traverse to 'be run out into the lake
into the waters of the State of Indiana,
where she lay all through the morning.
Large details of police were placed on
the shore guarding approaches to all the
docks from which the gamblers might
make their way to the lake.
It was the expectation of the authori
ties that the betting fraternity would
leave Chicago on the City of Traverse,
but instead of this a small excursion
steamer, the Eagle, had been chartered,
and the gamblers, walking past the po
lice, embarked and started for the City
of Traverse, which was rolling around in
midlake.
The police were powerless to intercept
the "excursionists," as they called them
selves, and with deep chagrin watched
them sail away to place their money "on
the races.
The announced programme of the man
agers of the floating poolroom was that
all passengers would be landed at the
foot of Ninety-second street In South
Chicago, where the Calumet River emp
ties . into Lake Michigan. Chief Collins,
balked in his attempt to prevent^the
sailing of the gamblers on the Eagle,
transferred his forces to Js'inety-second
street and posted them along the shore
in such a manner that it would have been
practically impossible for any man from
the City of Traverse or the Eagle to set
foot on shore and escape arrest.
Late in the day the Eagle steamed Into
the harbor at South Chicago loaded with
200 men who were anxious to reach the
shore. As soon as the boat was well in
side of the first bridge It was swung be
hind it. With escape to the lake cut oft
by the bridge and no possible chance of
i a safe landing on shore, the case of the
gamblers for a time looked desperate.
The Eagle circled around and around In
the harbor, tooting its whistle in frantic
fashion for the bridge tender to turn the
bridge and allow it to steam back into
the lake. The police stood on the shore
and laughed, feeling confident that it. 'was
only a question of time before the pas
sengers of the Eagle would be in their
power.
A small, insignificant mud scow hap
pened along at this critical moment,
however, and blew its whistle as a signal
for the bridge to open. The bridge tender
was compelled to swing the bridge, and
the Eagle, planting its bow squarely in
the stern of the mud scow, crowded In
closely as It passed through the bridge
and then made a run for the open lake
and freedom.
As soon as the , police discovered the
approach of the mud scow and realized
that the bridge must open they made a
rush for the fire tug Yosemlte, and by
the time the Eagle was entering the
waters of the lake the tug was , tearing
after it, loaded down with policemen.
The Eagle, however, steadily drew away
from the tug, and after a run of ten
minutes the police gave up the chase.
The Eagle landed at Indiana Harbor, its
passengers returning to Chicago by train.
Before the arrival of the Eagle at South
Chicago a small launch, the Panther,
came in bearing a number of gamblers
from the City of Traverse and several
fishermen. All the passengers of the
Panther were lined up on the pier and
compelled to stand in a heavy, rain while
the police weeded out the fishermen from
the. "excursionists." Fourteen .men who
could not prove that they had been fish
ing were loaded into the partol wagon
and carried to the police station.
The gamblers who returned to Chicago
this evening declared that even though
the police had arrested all the passengers
of the Eagle- they would have found it
impossible to prove a case; against them.

footrace swindle in Golden Gate Park
on June 13, 1903, when Herman Grun
naeur lost $2500, was resumed in Judge
Cook's court yesterday Attorney Frank
J. \u25a0'Murphy, one of defendant's counsel,
referred to the article in The Call as
to the transcripts of the testimony
taken at the preliminary examination
in the Police Court having been stolen
from the District Attorney's office and
the branch, office of the County Clerk.
Murphy denied that he or any one else
interested in the defens^ had anything
to do .with the disappearance of the
transcripts.
The case was closed yesterday after
noon and the Judge will deliver his
charge to the jury this morning. . The
witnesses for the prosecution were hazy
in their recollection of what, had trans
pired and in more than one instance
contradicted themselves when cross

CHICAGO. Aug. 3.â William J. Bryan
Jr. Is lying at the Presbyterian Hospital,
where he underwent- a surgical operation
yesterday for the removal of an abscess
on his right knee brought about by in
flammation that began with a corn on his
foot. Young Bryan was brought to the
hospital yesterday from Win6na Lake.
Ind., on a fast train. He is a student at
a military academy.
The hospital physicians announced that
his condition was not dangerous, but that
the prompt action in bringing him to
Chicago for treatment' prevented a se
rious turn. The inflammation that result
ed in the forming of the abscess was first
noticeable two* weeks ago. A corn on his
rfght foot first became inflamed after it
had been accidentally cut. The* cut be
came infected, and It was for this reason
that blood poisoning was feared. ;
The young man, who is IS years old,
kept the facts of his condition from his
parents and other relatives. Bryan is
now touring in Ohio. After the reassur
ing report by the hospital physicians,
who say that the boy will be able to re
turn to his studies in a few days, word
was sent last night to his father and his
uncle. Charles W. Bryan, at Lincoln.

A few days ago L. H. Taylor, who owns
the lands covering the outlet of the
Truckee River, filed suit to restrain Ed
ward Malley frcm cutting the canal, set
ting forth that the canal would take
from the plaintiff the power, to control
the flow of the waters of the lake into
the Truckee and destroy his prysp?ct3 ot
installing an immense power plant. Upon
the filing of the complaint a temporary
restraining order was issued directing
Malley to forthwith suspend work on the
canal.
LÂ»ate yesterda*y afternoon, however,
United States District Attorney Robert T.
Devlin and his assistant. A. P. Black,
appeared before Judge Troutt and a.-rked
that the restraining, order be modified.
Mr. Devlrn stated that the United States
Government was the real defendant and
that' Malley appeared only as agent to
carry out the Government's project. Mr.
Malley took the stand and testified that
he was simply acting on behalf of the
Government and that the position of the
Uniteci States Attorney was correct.
Judge Troutt then modified the re
straining order, permitting the Govern
ment to continue with the work from the
banks of the Truckee up to within - 100
feet of the lake. The court thought it
necessary that the 100-foot embankment
be left, that there would be no danger ot
the waters of the lake breaking through,
until such time as laylor's suit is finally
determined.
It developed yesterday afternoon In
Judge Troutt's department of the Supe
rior Court that the United States Govern
ment is back of the project to dig a
canal from Lake Tahoe to the Truckee
River, cutting off some miles of crooked,
treacherous rivtr bed, that the great irri
gation scheme for the reclamation of the
desert wastes of Nevada may be fur
thered.
NEW. YORK. Aug. 3.â Efforts to recon
struct the Manhattan terminal of the
Brooklyn bridge for the purpose of re

made travel during the rush hours a
menace to life and limb were begun yes
terday. By October It is expected that
the improvements will bÂ» completed and
the congestion in traffic stopped.
Temporary relief only is expected from"
the present reconstruction. Work on a
J5.000.000 terminal recently authorized by
the city authorities will begin next year
and will require a considerable time for
completion. The platforms will be great
ly extended and changes will be made
enabling the Brooklyn elevated trains to
cross the bridge at all times, thus doing
away with -the terriflc scramble to board
bridge trains.

Ru*sinn Jew* Trust in Thin Country*
influence to JJetter Their Condition.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 3.-Dr. Adolphe
Danzig*. r, formerly United States Consul
at Madrid, has arrived here to lay before
the Department of Commerce and LaCor
memoranda concerning the conditions of
the Jew's abroad, the information being
gathered at the request of the depart
ment for the use in the Bureau of Im
migration in dealing with that class of
immigrants.
"In England, Germany and Russia,"
said Dr. Danziger. in reviewing: his ob
servations, ''what struck me most notable
was the hopeful views the Jtws take of
America.
"The people, I met. were hoping that
the President would take the opportun
ity that presented itself to Induce the
Russian Government to grant them free
dom or at least to give them equal rights
in Russia. Many of the Russian Jews
do not want to leave that country. They
iove their country , in spite of the ter
rible oppression that has been brought
I upon them by the Russian Government.
j "I found .a terrible condition among the
I Russian Jews who i.aye gone to England
jto come to this country. The steamship
! companies are afraid to bring them here
for fear they will be declared paupers,
with the result that the steamship com
panies would have to take them back
to Ensiand. In order to refuse them
passage when they have the money to
pay their way the companies invent ex
cuses. They declare that they are suf
fering from some kind of disease. The
fact is, the Jews th*re are powerful fel
lows, who have had their muscles trained
on farms in Russia. They are not only
farmers but mechanics 01 ail kinds."
Dr. Danslger expressed the opinion that
the South offered an opening for the Jews
if the interests there were anxious to ob
tain white labor for farm work.

The Board of Education received noti
fication yesterday from James McSheehy,
who was detailed to supervise operations
on the building of additions to the Crock
er Grammar School building on Page
street, near Baker, that the contractor
in raising the building had failed to put
I proper underpinning beneath the struc
ture and there was danger of anou.er col
lapse such as the one which recently oc
curred on Ninth street.
McSheehy immediately not.fied the con
tractor, Frederick G. JoneS, to strengthen
the frail supports. This was done.
School Director Boyle, who investigated
the matter, said the supports could have
been easily dislodged and the timely dis
covery prevented a serious accident.
The fact that Jones will not complete
the additions to the building In time for
the opening *of the school term, on Au
gust 14 caused the Board of Education
to instruct McSheehy to make immediate
arrangements to hire quarters in the
neighborhood for the accommodation of
531 pupils who are enrolled in the school.
McSheehy will ascertain if a large market
on Oak street, near Devisadero. can be
secured for the purpose, and will figure
the cost of installing class rooms therein.
Then he will arrange for the renting of
Phelps Hall on Devisadero street, near
Oak, where several more class rooms
can be fitted up. A room formerly occu
pied by the school at Oak and Broderick !
streets will also be pressed # into service.
The Crocker Grammar School has
twelve class rocms and that number will
have to be provided in the course of the
next ten days. The board is wroth over
the delay in the reconstruction' of the
building and will not consent to an ex
tension of a single day to Jones, who has
until September 21 to do the work. His
bondsmen will be held responsible should
he fail to build the additional six rooms
by that time.
President Roncovierl returned from his
Eastern trip primed with new ideas for
school administration and school con
struction which he will utilize in the many
new buildings to be constructed under the
bond Issue. â¢
Attorney Jassinowsky of Warsaw,
leader of the seceding Zionists, declares
that the majority of the original con
gress did not represent the interes-.s
of the Jewish nation, and adds:
"A great mistake was made in re
fusing the land offered by the English
Government as a site for a colony. It
would have been the beginning of a
movement that would have had world
wide significance and would have made
a haven where persecuted JeVs would
.have taken refuge."
Dr. Cyrkin, a radical, said: "We "in
tend to conduct the new Zionist party
on democratic principles and the new
organization will be completed along
the lines originally planned for the
old Zionist party. We will establish a
central committee . in Paris with
branches throughout the whole world."
Israel Zangwill, the author, said:
â¢The rejecting of the English offer, if
it had been agreed to by the majority
of our people, would have been the
death blow to practical Zionism and
would have reduced the movement to a
chase of phantoms. Zionism will be
rescued by the Territoriahsts, who nave
abandoned the original movement and
have organized a new movement that
is> bound to be crowned with success."
Banker Wolfsom of London declared
that the congress had been absolutely
without fruit and that its session will
greatly retard the growth of the move
ment. "The riotous scenes." he said,
'discredited Zionists in the eyes of the
world and it will be a long uphill task
to recover the lost ground."
NEW YORK. Aug. 3.â lnterviews
with leaders in the Zionist movement,
gathered by special correspondents at
tending the Zionist Congress, which
closed yesterday at Basle. Switzerland,
are published to-day by the Jewish
Morning Journal.
â¢ SAULT STE. MARIE, Mich.. Aug. 13.
Commemoration exercises In the Gov
ernment Park here adjoining the ship
canal made up the second day's pro
gramme of the semi-centennial celebra
tion of the opening or the St. Marys
ship canal, which connects Lake Su
perior with the lower lakes. The ex
ercises took the form of a programme
of addresses, the feature of which was
an address by Vice President C. W.
Fairbanks. . \u0084 ;
A concert by the Calumet and Hecla
bands. at S> o'clock opened the exec
cises.
The park was well filled before the
music began and at its conclusion. the
l grounds were crowded with thousands
of people. Archdeacon Lord of Sault
Ste. Marie opened the exercises with,
an invocation and Hon. Charles S. Os
borne of this city followed with an ad
dress, which, in graceful words, he
made the throngs welcome to the city.
Second in importance, perhaps, to the
address of the Vice President was that
made by Hon. Peter White of Mar
quette, president of the commission
which has been in charge of the cele
bration and the most widely known
man in the upper peninsula of Michi
gan. White's topic was "The Develop
ment of the Lake Superior Region."
White is a pioneer in the upper penin
sula, and Is an authority on the history
of that part of the State and its de
velopment from an unexplored wilder
ness to its present importance as a
mining center. White described the de
velopments of the mining industry in
the upper peninsula and the marvelous
growth of the lake marine traffic since
the opening of the first 330-foot lock
here, tifty years ago.
The commemoration exercises were
ao lengthy that they were divided into
a morning and afternoon programme,
the speakers and distinguished guests
beir.g entertained during the interval
at luncheon at Le Sault de Ste. Maria
Club.
.The Pacific Mail Company's coaster
San Ju.n. Captain liny, which arrived
yesttrdsy from I'^na'.na. brought 131

AGED VICTIM
OF INJUSTICE
Man of 85 Years Still Striv
ing to Induce British Gov
ernment to Kight a Wrong
BOABDS AT THE CECIL
Premier of New Zealand
Pays for tke Meals of
a Peddler of Matches
Special Dispatch to The Call
LONDON, Aug. 3.â Victims of injustice
are many, but lew oi them have such a
romantic history as Jonn VV. Burt, a
little white-bearded old man' who sells
newspapers, boot laces and matches for
a jiving? sleeps in one of the London
County Council's cheap lodging-houses
ana feeds sumptuously three times a day
at the Hotei Cecil, one ut London's most
luxurious caravansaries. It is probably
due to th e fact that the requirements of,
his inner man are so abundantly satiatied
that Burt, despite his 15 years, endures
his lot with patient resignation and san
guinely awaits the day when his wrongs
will be righted and he will be restored
again to alttuence.
It is to Premie* -'Dick" Seddon of New
Zealand that the old man is indebted for
this strange tempering of the wind to
the shorn lamb. The picturesque colonial
statesman possesses the virtue of never
forgetting an old friend. Ht and Burt
were "pals" at the Ballarat gold dig
gings in Australia long years ago, and
for two years shared all the hardships
and luck that came their way. Then they
parted company and' did not meet again
until they accidentally ran across, each
other in London a few years ago. Burt
was then having a hard time of it to
keep himself out of the poorhouse and
Seddon was being feted everywhere as
one of the apostles of imperial unity.
That made no difference to the big-hearte
d Premier. He broke an engagement
with a titled nabob that he and the old
man might dine together at tha Cecil.
And when he returned to New Zealand
he left directions with tha proprietor
that Burt should be allowed to take what
meals he pleased there. The bills are set
tled by Seddon.
It was a trumpery dispute about a
watch that was the source of all the mis
fortune that has dogged Burfs footsteps
for the last seventeen years. For some
time after he and Seddon dissolved their
gold-prospecting partnership he pros
pered and acquired a valuable farm in
Tasmania. One day he sent a gold watch
to a watchmaker in Fingal to be repaired.
But the watch that was ' returned to him
was another watch and of Inferior qual
ity, according to Burt's story. The mat
ter was then taken into court. There the
magistrates urged Burt to accept a judg
ment of nonsuit and in\the presence of
a witness return the watch to the watch
maker and then sue again to recover his
own. Burt acted on their advice.
He got slugged for his pains by the
watchmaker and was laid up for several
weeks in consequence. Then he sued the
watchmaker for assault, claiming heavy
damages. When the case came up for
trial it was discovered that, instead of a
judgmena of nonsuit, a verdict had been
entered against" Burt. ,In view of this
the court dismissed his claim, with costs
â¢amounting to over $1000.
Since then Burt's life has been one long:
struggle to obtain a rehearing of the
case. That a wrong verdict had been
entered was admitted, but, as the legal
authorities of Tasmania interpreted 'the
lav/, there was no way by which the
wheels of justice could be revolved back
ward and the wrong verdict changed into
a right one. The watchmaker had a big
political pull and that was exerted against
Burt to the utmost. In the fight, Burt's
farm was gobbled up by the lawyers and
his means utterly-exhausted. Finally the
Attorney General of the colony declared
that the wrong verdict co.uld be ex
punged and the right verdict substituted
for it only through a special act of the
Imr -rial Parliament and the royal-as
sen> thereto.
Punlic feeling in behalf of the old man,
who had been beggared in his efforts to
obtain justice, was strongly aroused in
Tasmania. A fund was raised to enable
him to come to England and prosecute
his claim here. \He arrived In 1599. He
appealed to Queen Victoria, to the Privy
Council, to the House of Lords and to
King Edward, and the only result has
been an accumulation of 'documentary
evidence that would nearly fill a furniture
van. j The wrong verdict still stands
against him. No compensation for a for
tune-dissipated in striving to get it set
right has been awarded him.
But, sustained by the bountiful fare
provided for him through Seddon's gen
erosity, the old man continues his gal
lant fight against legal red tape and cir
cumlocution. He declares that he will not
return to Tasmania until he has obtatned
a decision one way or the other. The
chances are that he will be dead and
probably be buried in a pauper's -grave
before it is reached, i* Â»

CHICAGO, Aug. 3.â lnfluenced* by/higher
prices at Liverpool the wheat market opened
quite firm, the September option Mfelne un a
shade to Â»4&% c at 84%@84% c . The. strength
of the EnglUh market was due to- reported
confirmation of a Ehortage in the Russian
crop. On; moderate demand from commission
.houses the September delivery touched 85c soon
after th e opening-. Sentiment then became
bearish and pit traders sold freely. Conditions
affecting the spring . sown crop furnished the'
principal reason for the change In sentiment.
Throughout Minnesota and the Dakotas the
weather was clear and the temperature moder
ate. In addition the Government bureau pre
dicted for to-morrow a continuance of condi
tions favorable to the quick maturing of the
new crop. Asa result the early advance In
prices to-day was .completely obliterated, but
the market sagged below yesterday's final fig
ures, September dropping to 84 % c. Spread of
bearish sentiment, however." was effectively
checked by news from the Southwest, where
the movement of ' the . new â¢ crop ' seemed begin
ning to show signs of abatement. Arrivals
to-day at St. Xouls and Kansas City aggre
gated 339,000 bushels, against 578, 000. a year
ago. The price of cash wheat in the: South
western markets" showed \an - advance to-day,
and this Increased the demand for options here
A late feature of moderate bullish interest was
the Ohio report, showing for July a decline of
3 points in Uie condition of wheat. During

STOCK AND BOND EXCHANGE.
There Were continued' heavy arrivals of
Bartlett Pears and Peaches In bulk. and both
descriptions ruled very weak, as the canners
were running to full- capacity on contract sup
plies of the former and were purchasing but
little of anything In the open market. Ripe
Bartlett Pears In wrappers were wanted by the
regular trad* and ruled firm, while Peaches,
both packed and loose were very weak and
prices had a wide range as to variety, quality
and size of package. Shipping brokers were
paying higher prices for choice Plums and
Prunes In crates, there being a scarcity of
suitable stock. There was a good inquiry for
Grapes for export on the Puget Sound steam
er, fine Muscat, Malaga and Rose of Peru sell
ing for that purpose at $I@l' 15 per crate.
Seedless too were In good request, the bsst
lots finding prompt sale at 75@S5c per crate.
Nutmeg Melons and Cantaloupes were steady
during the early trade, the principal river boat
with fresh supplies being late, but there was
no scarcity and the market became weak upon
the arrival of the belated boat. The market
for ordinary Apples was In a state Of complete
demoralisation and, although select parcels of
Gravenstelns In 4-tler packages still sold up
to $1 15 per box. $1 was the ruling price for
the general run of fancy stock. Crab Apples
continued firm under an urgent demand and
limited supplies. In the Berry line Raspberries
did better and Strawberries were steady, while
Blackberries remained very weak, with a large
portion of the day's receipts going- to the can- I
ners at the Inside quotation. Citrus goods
were steady and aside from an advance In

States Stf-rl stocks was alto attributed to the
Morgan influence, tcKether with trte continued
favoral>> reports from that industry. The
ere and metal industrials showed the continued
effect of the persistent assertions of the work
ing out cf a merger plan. The Southern rail
roads were also the subject of some rumors of
a proposed holding company for joint control.
The great public interest shown in the ap
j-raoching peace negotiations was fully shared
in the financial district, but without apprecia
ble effect on the market for stocks here. In
foreign markets some slight depression was
perceptible from this cause. The closing of
the London Stock Exchange from Friday until
Tuesday was given to explain the extreme dull
ness of that market and the Insignificant
ruMness done here for that account. Weather
r.tws affecting the grain crops was regarded
ss= good. Money was easy, but the possible
reduction of resources within the next few
wefks ecunes In for consideration. Sub-Treas
wty operations show a balance against the
"VÂ£-ks thus far this week of over $3,500,000,
J^ payment of Government interest having
r ml no offset to the payment last Satur
day of the Central Pacific note to the Govern
ment. The second installment of 5 per cent
cf the Japanese loan subscriptions was payable
to-day, calling Ear only $2,r>00.000. The privi
lege accrued, however, to pay the balance of
f'jVscciiptions to-day. Tlie unruffled demeanor
cf the money market did net reveal any large
tTJiFitions for this purport. The strength in
rprcial stocks did not awaken a comparative
rf-^T^-rse at any time, but the greatest activity
and ftrer.sth of the day were in the final
dealings ard the closing- was *troni? at the
h'rhert. Borfls were irregular. Total cales.

Xciv York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK, Aug. 3. â The bureau report Is
bullish. 16 per cent lower than last year's con
dition of 91.4, which, when added to 15 per
cent decrease In the acreage, promises a crop
of only two-thirds that of a year ago, aay
9,112.000 bales, and when ngured on the small
crop year of- 1003 it only points to 8,800,000.
If we allow 7 per. cent for exaggeration only
9.925.0C0 is the result on last year's baEis anl
only 9.."00.000 on the baÂ«s of the year before.
The Government report of conditions in the
cotton . belt fully confirms recent private re
port? and ve/y plainly shows that the crop Is
actually threatened with failure and that the
season may prove a. calamitous one to the pro
ducer unless weather condition* from now on
are of the most perfect character. On tht
basis of this report the indications point to
ultimately higher prices regardless of present
manipulation.

We went as far as Twenty-sixth avenue, as
I said, and then Tom Cook turned out' ln the

Yes, sir. SchneJder^and I were ten feet away

Schneider ran at all.' I made up my mind It
was best to run and run. as fast as I could.
I didn't make up my rr/nd to run. I Just ran
as quick as I could.
' Where did you get the pipe that was used on
Cook's head?
Found It In Harold's orchard, wrapped up In
a paper; apparently, It had been hid there.
When did you rind this?
That was In the afternoon some time, and
Blaker and Schneider' went arter It some time,
I suppose, and they had it down there at the

YOUNG FOOTPAD WHO BROKE DOWN YESTERDAY AND TOLD SHERIFF BARNET THAT HE WAS WITH BLAKER \ND
SCHNEIDER WHEN THEY HELD UP AND ROBBED THOMAS COOK. AND THAT HE R.Ov AWAY AFTER SEEING
BLAKER STRIKE HIS VICTIM ON THE HEAD WITH A BLUDGEON.
Amazement was depicted on the face
of Attorney Newburgh In Judge Cook's
court yesterday morning when the re
mittitur from the. District Court of Ap
peals in the case of William Noon was
ve'ad.* Noon was convicted on a charge
of burglary and on April 30, 1904, he
was sentenced to serve twenty years in
San .Quentin,. as there were several
prior convictions against him. An ap
peal was taken on the ground that a
P9.crÂ«Â» had been taken from the in
formation against Noon by some one in
the District Attorney's office, and this,
it was said, invalidated the whole pro
ceedings. The point w"as raised at the
trial, but was overruled. â¢ 'jl*
The remittitur read that the cause
"had been affirmed. Newburgh protest-,
ed that, the Appellate Court had grant
ed the defendant a new trial and that
a grievous mistake had been made.
Assistant District Attorney Ashe said
he would have to abide by the remit
titur and the Judge said he would send
his clerk to the Appellate Court to ask
for an explanation.
' In about -an hour the clerk from- the
Appellate Court appeared with another
remittitur showing that the defendant
had been granted a new trial and ex
plaining that an error had been made.
Ttie case was continued till Monday to
be set for trial. Noon entered the room
of C- Heuaer, 503 Mason street, on Jan
uary 21. 19tÂ»4, during the absence of the
occupant.

REMITTITUK SEXT TO JUDGE
COOK'S COURT CAUSES STIR
OAKLAND, Aug. S.â Percy Pembroke,
one of the youths Sheriff Barnet took in
to custody on suspicion, has confessed
the details of tho brutal murder of
Thomas YV. Cock, the young grocer of
Fruitvaie, who succumb^ yeeterday to
the terrible injuries he received. Pem
broke says that George Blaker, th.c son
of the captain of the ferry-boat Berkeley,
dealt the fatai blows w..h a piece of pipe
ai:d 'that John Schneider participated in
the revolting crime. The prisoner who
lias weuker.ed protests thr.t he did not
take part in the murder and was averse
to accompanying Schneider and Blaker
on the expedition. \u25a0He â¢ declares that
crrawhurst. the fourth _ suspect in jail.
hud nothing to do wit^i'the murder, but
was a member of tho gang which had
commit ted a number of misdeeds.
!t was in the dead hour of night that
Sheriff Barnet called the shuddering boy
from lÂ»ig cell and demanded all the details
of tht- murderous expedition. The Sheriff
had good reason to beiJeve Pembroke
would break down. When told the day
before of Cook's death the lad became
unnerved in marked degree.
It was after midnight this morning
when the clanking of Cfll-door boit re
sounded through ihe prison stillness and
caused the boy prisoner to jump in alarm
from his restless bed. Without explana
tion Sheriff Barnet led him to the office \u25a0
and the youth, vic^.m of evil associa
tions, there confessed.
He was present when Cook was struck
down and heard the cries of terror as
the beating with the pipe was ad
ministered. Pembroke, says he ran from
the feeene as soon as the assault was
made and did not share In the robbery, i
PI.OTTIXG OF CRIME.
He had met Schneider and Blaker that
evening and they indicated to him that
Crowhurst was to join them in some
criminal enterprise. Then, it was sug
gested that young Cook should be robbed,
gcd Pembroke says the other two urged
that he should "hit" the victim. He
had one of the bludgeons and Blaker the
other. Pembroke demurred, saying he
had had enough of such "rackets." but
the urginge were renewed and the
temptation held out of the money that
\u25a0would be realized.
Cook was seen leaving 1 the store, and
Pembroke refusing to make the as
saulJ, it fell to Blaker to strike the gro
cer. Pembroke declares that he ran
eway and did not take part in the
| rifling of the pockets of $200 or more.
i Xone of the boys in the gang is out
jof h!s teens. Yet they seem to have
I been the boldest an-J most viciou3 of
I criminals. James Crowliurst was the
I ring-leader and the g^angr took the name
of "Jim Crows." after I: is name. While,
he is not implicated in the Cook case,
having failed to appear In time to join.
Schneider, Blaker and Pembroke, who
waited for him until the grocer came
: In sight, he will not be let off. however,
j for Sheriff Barnet and District Attorney;
j Allen believe him to be a far too dan
i gerous character to be allowed his
freedom and lie will be prosecuted on
i some one of the many offenses to which
â¢ he has confessed.
The charge of murder -will now be
! formally placed against Schneider and
j Blaker. while Pembroke and Crowhurst
will have to answer for the other rob
beries the youthful criminals have ad-
I initted they committed.
PKMnitOKE'S COXFESSIOX.
After Pembroke broke down this
morning Sheriff Barnet summoned
i Chief Jailer White and Deupty Charlie
Clark, and in their presence questions
by the Sli'?riff and the answers of the
prison< j r w*Â»re taken down in short-!
hand, a? fellows:
Now, I want you to undt rt>tand that this is
a free and voluntary statement en your part
without any thri-at coming from me. You un
tler^tar.d that, do you?
Yes. sir.
Now. ptart in ar.d tell me the first time you
heard of th<- proposition to hold uji this man
Torn Cook en July 'SJ of this year. Start right
from the beginning.
We wert at Twenty-third avenue and the
old county road. ar<J Biaker. I think it was
askÂ»d me if I would come with him, or some
thing of that sort. He told me "to knock
Tom Cook." I didn't realize right away what
he meant. I ihous'bt he v.-as going to have a
fisht with him or something. 1 asfcrd, "Arc
yea poinir to have a ripht?" and ho says. "No,
we are going to hold him up." and so I says.'
"I don't want none of th-.t in mine; I have
had en<-u?h." And he'ktp* on talking and
everything, and tellingr us about- all the money
we would have and all- that.
Whom did he say this to? " '
He told it to me.
To jou alone?
YeÂ£.
Go ahÂ»ad.
So I Fatd. '"I will walk up that way with
you. but I won't hit him or anything like
that." So w-e started as soon as> they closed
up the etore. We went up the street; we fol
lowed them up the street.
Whom do you mean by them?
Tom Cook and old man Cruff.
Then what happened?
We went as far as Twenty-fourth avenue
Says He Ran Away When Victim 1
Was Felled With Pipe Bludgeon.
Straight goods, lemcrtades and high
balls arc now purchasable In the town of
Bullfrog at metropolis rates. Barbers are
shaving with real, lather and baths are
a common every-day luxury with the
miners of that prosperous Nevada mining
center. A week ago water was selling In
Bullfrog at $2 50 and $3 a barrel; miners
had to walk seven miles to get a batb.
and dumb beasts were lucky if they got
one Vood drink a day. Water was more
jxpensivc than whisky at the bars, where
a. palron would as soon ask for a lemon
ade as he would for the diamond stud in â¢
i.Tc bartender's shirt front.
On Sunday the new water company,
which has just completed a twelve-mile
pipe line, turned on the fluid, and Bull
frog's populace turned itself loose. Baths
and drinks of water were the order of
the day, and a great day it was. As the
result cf the important innovation water
is now selling for a cent a gallon in the
mining town and the price of drinks has
laded to the "bit" mark.
11. H. Clark, general manager of the
Bullfiog Mining Company and the pro
moter of the telegraph and telephone sys
tems and ether enterprises of BtaUfrog.
arrived here yesterday from Nevada and
is staying at fhe Palace. It is mainly
through his energy that a water system .
was :>iovided for the mining town, with
a daily flow of nearly 500,000 gallons.
Anticipating a great waste of water,
Clark and his associates conceived the
idea of establishing a big swimming
tank, probably the only one In a Western I
mining camp, where the traveler, after a
long and hot ride, may find unexpected
comfort on his arrival in Bullfrog.
An ice plant is about to be started, and
the next enterprise that Clark will estab
lish in the iov.-n will be a smelter at his
mine. His present visit to San Francisco
is in connection with this matter. I

Unnerved by death of the victim, Percy Pembroke broke down when Sheriff Barnet took him Jr 6m his cell during the hours
of night that murderers dread, and told how George Blaker viciously felled Thomas W. Gook with a bludgeon. Pembroke
says he then ran away and left B laker and John, Schneider to complete the crime of murder and robbery. The youth protests

UNMATOUBLE .SHOE VALUES
For years San Francisco was skeptical about shoe sales un-
â¢ til Kaufmann's inaugurated genuine shoe sales. The buying pub-
lic readily appreciated the difference, and now a Kaufmann sale
meets instantaneous response. An advertised reduction here is a
real cut from regular prices; every statement made in an adver-
tisement is the absolute truth.
Our summer clearance offer 1 : shoe values the like of which
. have not been known here for many years. A great number of
complete lines of the finest summer shoes that were shipped late
by factories must be closed out before fall. The manufacturers
made us extraordinary inducements to keep them, and the prices \u25a0
on these shoes now are actually less than the cost of making.
