the I>abor Upheaval.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 10.â St.
! Petersburg is again face to face with
â  a renewal of the labor upheaval, the
i immediate incitement being the failure
of the workmen to obtain payment for
' the time they were out on strike, added
i to the fact that there has been no
I adjustment of the demands which led
! to the strike last month.
The Putiloff Iron Works, where the
former strike originated, ia playing the
i principal part. There are 30,000 work
men already out within the metropolis
1 district and workmen at the torpedo
! factory in Kolpinu, eighteen miles dis
; t.'tnt, have joined the strikers. There
is a strong prospect of the movement
! extending.
Only energetic measures by the troops
, and police prevented the resumption to
1 day of the former tactics of the strik-
I ers marching from factory to factory
and inducing or compelling employes
j to lay down their tools. Thus far there
! has been no disorder In St. Petersburg
! and the authorities appear to have the I
: situation well in hand in this respect. '
I It is generally believed that such pre
i cautions have been taken as will pre
i elude the repetition of the bloodshed
I of January 22.
However, circumstantial reports that i
! the revolutionary element is about to
I Join with the strikers and resort to
bomb-throwing are causing grave ap
, prehensions.
Father Gopon's organization still exr
ibts, but secretly, and it is less effect
ive. On the other hand the employers
realize the importance of a prompt set
tlement of the workmen's grievances,
but have allowed weeks to slip by with
out deciding on combined action. The
accessions to the ranks of the strikers
have reduced to idleness the entire
region 'between the Moscow and the

the Defeat of Lena or Bard's
Amendment
WASHINGTON. Feb. 10.â Statehood :
for Oklahoma and New Mexico will
sot be granted during this session of ,
Congress unless it be on lines provided .
in the House Statehood bill, admitting ;
New Mexico and Arizona as one State. ;
This was decided to-day at a confer- j
ence of Republican members of the
; House. The following resolution setting'
! forth this position was adopted, by 112
; to 33, after three hours of debate:
â¢'Resolved, That it is the sense of J
I this caucus that the decision of the Re- â 
I publican caucus held on April 19. touch
! ing the statehood of New Mexico and
' Arizona, as provided in the bill of the j
i House which has been amended in the ;
j Senate and is now pending in the House '
; Committee on Territories, be insisted j
I upon, and that we insist on such par
| liamentary proceedings as can be had
by a majority of the House or a special
I order as can be adopted by a majority
j of the House, under which the afore
| said policy of the Republicans of the
House will b$ worked out."
Speaker Cannon is the author of this
resolution.
Delegate Rodye of New Mexico made
j a strong appeal for concurrence in the
j Senate bill. Delegate McGuire of Okla-
I homa pleaded for action whereby at
I least Oklahoma and Indian Territory
I might be admitted. Speaker Cannon
occupied the ftoor at length on two dlf
j ferent occasions.
The debate was keyed to a high pitch
at all times. The ground was taken) by
j those Tvho favored the House provi
i fcions or nothing that the Republicans
! of the body would be sacrlficlnK their
i position to a few Republican Senators
! if the bill as amended were accepted.
A definition of what is regarded as
i the binding feature of a caucus was
! made to those Republican members
| who have indicated an intention to
i vote with the Democrats should oppor
tunity arise for the acceptance of the
Senate bill. This definition was that
unless a member gave notice in caucus
that he would not be bound by the ac
tion taken he must hold himself bound
thereby.

AUDIENCE
IS CHEATED
BY DEATH
Singer Found Dead
in Dressing-
Room.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« CalL
REDLANDB, Feb. 10.- While the
fashionable audience that crowded the
New Wyatt Theater to the doors was
Impatiently waiting to hear another
song by Mrs. J. P. McElroy of Los An
geles, formerly of Philadelphia, she
was lying dead in her dressing-room.
She was found there by her husband
and the theater attendants a few mm- j
utes after her time came to sing.
The occasion was one of the most
notable functions in Redlands society ;
this season, being the annual vaude- J
{ ville performance by the Redlands i
Lodge of Elks. A number of sineers of i
ability had been engaged and among !
them Mrs. McElroy. She sans the â 
"Bridge of Sighs" early on the pro- |
gramme, and was down for another
I gong near the close. She had been re
| ceived with much enthusiasm and had
responded to an encore.
When the time arrived for her to at>- i
pear again her husband gave the si*- 1
nal which was her cue to appear upon ]
the stage, but there was no resDonse. !
An investigation showed that her dress- j
ing-room was locked. The door was !
forced open and she was found lylner
dead upon the floor. Several physicians
were summoned from the audience, and j
they pronounced heart disease as the
cause of death.
Mrs. McElroy was well known in the
musical world in the East. She came
to California only a short time ago and
took up her home in Los Anjjeles, where
she has appeared on many occasions.
The body will be sent to Los Angeles.
The announcement of Mrs. McElrov's
death caused the audience to leave the
theater.

FOURTH BOODLING SENATOR IS ARRESTED
JORDAN LOSES
HIS POSITION
AS SECRETARY
Age&f Is No Longer Scribe
of Sau Francisco
] delegation.
Fate Is Decided After
Lengthy Debate in the
Senate.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 10.â They
wasted something like $tSt worth of
time in the Senate this morning in an
ethical effort to decide whether the
few dollars that are coming to un- .
fortunate Joseph S. Jordan, up to to- ,
day secretary of the San Francisco !
â turial delegation, should be or- ,
dered withheld from him by the Treas
urer of the ate.
The debate on the question took al
most the entire forenoon session and
followed the adoption of a resolution I
ictroduced by Selvage dropping Jor- j
dan from the roll. Prior to the adop- ;
lion of Selvage's resolution there was
some discussion as to the best way to ]
expunge Jordan's name from the roll, ;
6ome holding that the Senate should
first wait for the report of the investi
gating committee, for the only knowl
edge the Senate had as a body might
be termed hearsay. But as the upper
house is not bound by the rules of cvi- !
drnce this point was not taken seri
ousjy and there were no votes against
the resolution dropping Jordan from;
the roll. I
Then came the quest. on as to whether :
Jordan's warrants to date should be
withheld. Selvage thought this would â¢
be the proper course, but after a long
debate on the question Curtln called
the attention of the Senate to the fact
that the constitution did not even call
for the confiscation of a man's property
' upon his conviction for murder. This
settled the question and Jordan will re
ceive his money to date. His successor
will be named Monday.
NORMAL SCHOOL. BILL-
legislators Watching Measure Now in
<.o\<>rnor"p Hands.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 10.â Now that
ill appropriating $150,000 for the
San Fram isHi Normal School is in the
hands of the QOVCTMT, the San Fran
cisco Senatorial and Assembly delega
tions are keeping a strict eye on it and
they will not let the thief executive for
get that they want it signed.
The MB is the first carrying an ap
propriation for a public building to be
reported out by the Ways and Means
viittee. Two of the San Francisco
delegation, McGowan and Jones, were
un this committee, and they made the
bill their special concern. The entire
delegation put. it 6 shoulder behind it
and as a consequence when it came uu
he file for passage yesterday tht
unal'i objection that was raised was
promptly overcome.
The anxiety of the San Franciscans
he Mil passed early in the ses-
Fion was due to a fÂ«*ar that if it was
delayed along with the other appropri
ation bills and passed toward the close
t>f tht session the Governor might for
Â£*n to affix his signature to it. in which
case it would be in the dead list. As
if he fails to approve or veto it
within ten days after its passage it
will become a law anyway.

Warrants of Senator Welch and As

SACRAMENTO. Feb. 10.â The State
Board <yi Examiners this afternoon cut
lrom the January pay roll of the State
Harbor Oommissirm the claims of R. J.
Wekh. chief wharfinger of San Fran
harbor, and Louis Strohl, one of
his assistants. This action was taken
sc ground that Welch is now re
i tiving pay from the State as a Senator
and Strohl as an Assemblyman, and
that neither if entitled to draw two
palariep at one time.
hf name appears on the State
Harbor Commission pay roll for $250
for services during January and

After these sums had been deducted
the State Controller drew warrants for

sum of 122.767.

SACRAMENTO. Feb. 10.âSenator
elect Flint dropped into the Assembly
during the afternoon and a speech was
demanded of him. In response he said
his purpose in coming here was to take
a trip on the Sacramento River to learn
what was necessary to improve its
navigability and reclaim the lands it
firmed over. He wished, too, to show
the people of thf State that his state
ment that he represented all actions,
north and south, wag true. Before his
departure for Washington, he Â»aid. it
was his desire to visit every locality

Jnpe for San Diego and Eureka.

WRIGHT APPEARS
WITH SURETIES
EVADES SHERIFF BECAUSE
HE DREADED NIGHT IN JAIL
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACKAMEXTO, Feb. 10. â State
Senator Eli Wright, the one member
of the crowd of four Senators ac-
CMCfI of bribery who could not be
found by the Sheriff last night, gave
himself into custody to-day. He
walked into the office of Sheriff Reese
shortly after 10 o'clock in the fore
noon and surrendered himself.
Wright's reason for secreting himself
last night is that he had not secured
two bondsmen and was not willing to
take the chance of passing a night in
the county jail. He looked pale and
haggard when he reached the Sher
iff's office.
Wright gave the Sheriff the names
of some friends who he said would
furnish bonds for him and he sat in
the office until nearly noon while two
men who would qualify were being
found. George Eagan and Thomas
Norton, snloon-keepers, finally arrived
and signed the bond in the sum of
$5000 each before Superior Judge
Hart. W'right was allowed to go his
way and he lost no time in removing
himself from the courthouse, with its
prison suggestion.
The four boodling legislators will be
arraigned before Judge Hart on the
morning of Saturday, the ISth inst.
This was decided on to-day by the
I>istrict Attorney, who is anxious
that the cases go to trial as soon as
possible, that the witnesses may not
scatter and render locating them dif
ficult.
IX) BE TRIED IN MARCH
Although it is possible that the de
fendants will be placed on trial before
the adjournment of the Legislature, it
is not probable, though the entire ques
tion of the date of the hearing in the
criminal court rests with the defend
ants. District Attorney Seymour is
ready to proceed at this time, but the
fact is recognized that the defendants
are entitled to reasonable delay to pre
pare their case. The District Attorney
will insist, however, that the triai pro
ceed in the early part of March.
Just who will try the defendants has
not been determined. It is probable
that Judge Hart will try them all, in
view of his long experience in criminal
cases, but the desire that the cases
should be put through to a verdict with
the least possible delay may result in
the assignment of one to Judge
Hughes, one to Judge Shields and two
COVDUCTOR'S BRUTALITY
PAID FOR BY RAILROAD
Woman Ejected From a Train Gets a
Verdict for $999 Against
Company.
CHICAGO, Feb. 10.â Her hand hav
ing been squeezed by the conductor of
a railway train so severely that she
was unable to use it for fifteen months.
Mrs. Annie Young of Harvey is to be
paid $9Â»9 by the Chicago Terminal
Transfer Railway Company. Besides
suffering the squeeze which caused her
suit against the railway company, Mrs.
Young declares she was hurried and
dragged from the train and left "see
ing stars" beside the railroad track.
In deciding that the railway com
pany must pay Mrs. Young damages
the Appellate Court to-day declared
that, even if Mrs. Young did make a
mistake in boarding the wrong train,
she was entitled to great care and con
sideration in being shown her error.
The trouble occurred at Sixteenth
street station in 1897, when Mrs. YounK
believed she was boarding a train for
Blue Island, but was, in fact, setting
aboard the "race special" bound for
the Harlem track.

came as a surprise to him.

the War Department, Major Frank E.
Hobbp. ordnance department, will
make one visit prior to April 1 from
the Benicia arsenal to Fort Rosecrans,
Cal., to inspect the armament at that

Philippine Tariff Bill Favored.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 10.â The House
Committee on Ways and Means to-day
authorized a favorable report on the
tariff bill for the Philippines. The bill
provides for a complete revision of the

material particular by the committee.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL. SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 1905.
to Judge Hart. A separate indictment
was returned in each case.
The trials will constitute a series of
the hardest fought legal struggles in
the history of California. It is probable
that every step will be contested, and
many tough points of evidence brought
up. Demurrers to the indictments prob
ably will be interposed and fought out.
Every effort will be made to impeach
the witnesses of the prosecution, as
this, as indicated by the method em
ployed before the Senate inquiry, un
doubtedly will be one of the strongest
factors the defense will rely upon.
Feeling probably will run high and there
will be crowded houses at every ses
sion of court while the cases of the ar
rested Senators are being heard.
SEYMOUR CAUTIONS.
District Attorney Seymour is said to
be a man who proceeds slowly and
cautiously but stubbornly and deter
minedly when once he has mapped out
his course. He says he will treat these
cases as he would any other, trying
them fairly and dispassionately, with
a view toward getting at all the truth
and making the strongest presentation
possible.
It is likely that changes of venue will
be asked by some, if not all the ac
cused, but it will be maintained that
they could not receive a fairer trial
anywhere than here, where none of
them resides and where there are few
partisans with leanings either way.
An interesting question has arisen
here as to when successors to the of
fices now held by Emmons, French,
Wright and Bunkers will be selected in
event of their expulsion, which now
seems to be the only course open for
the Senate. The law provides that
when a vacancy occurs in either House
the Governor shall Immediately issue
writs of election, but in this case it is
said that this will not be done. Em
mons, French and Bunkers are hold
over Senators and as it would be Im
possible to elect their successors in
time for the present session the selec
tion of their successors will be left to
the next general election. Not bo in
the case of Wright, however. It is said
that in his case the Governor will wait
urtll a short time before the next ses
sion and then will order a special eleo
tion in his district to name his suc
cessor. All of these calculations will
be upset if it is found that a special
session should be necessary, In which
event the Governor would be compelled
to immediately call for the election of
successors to all four of the boodlers.
TALKS WITH THE PRESIDENT
ON CALIFORNIA IRRIGATION
Representative Daniels Brings Up the
itiiiM'iial Valley Reclamation
Project.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 10âRepresenta
tive Daniels of California and John M.
Rankin and R. H. Thayer, counsel for
the California Development Company,

regarding the taking over by the Gov
ernment reclamation service of the Im
perial Valley irrigation project, in Cali

persons in interest, so that an early
determination of the matter might be
reached.
The Interior Department to-day with
drew forty-five townships of public
lands in California, Nevada and Mon
tana from disposal under the public
land laws for irrigation purposes. These
embrace 506,880 acres in the Independ
ence (Cal.) and 539,920 acres in the Car-
Fon City (Nev.) land districts with
drawn from all forms of disposal.

Coghlan Shocks Legislators
by Giving Money Back
to the State.
Special Dispatch to The Call
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 10.â There was
a long debate in the Assembly this
morning over the passage of a bill
amending the act covering union high
school districts. The bill under dis
cussion was introduced by the Com
mittee on Education. Under the exist
ing law all pupils living in districts
adjoining such union districts that have
no high school may attend that in the
union district free. The amendment
provides that such pupils shall pay
for their attendance at such high
schools. The bill was passed.
The Committee on Ways and Means
filed a report showing that it had re
ceived appropriation bills representing
a total of $3,149,750 42; that it had re
ported favorably bills aggregating
$292,486 95, and that others calling for
$220,000 had been withdrawn, leaving a
total of $2,637,263 47 demanded by bills
that were still to be considered.
Assemblyman Coghlan introduced a
resolution that for a moment produced
a sensation. It recited that he wished
to turn back into the contingent fund
$294 that he had collected as mileage
on the trip of the Committee on Chari
ties and Corrections of which he is
chairman. It developed though that
Coghlan had not been attacked, with a
spasm of virtue and was not trying
any Kansas maneuver. A clerical error
had been made in figuring up the ac
count and it was merely an overcharge
that was being returned.
A motion that when the Assembly
adjourn it be till Monday morning at
10:30 was carried with hardly any dis
senting votes, experience having taught
that it would be hard to secure a
quorum Saturday.
EXHIBITS AT PORTLAND.
Alameda and Other Counties Want

SACRAMENTO, Feb. 10.â W. H.
Weilbye, Wilbur Walker and Theodore
Gier, who were Alameda County's Com
missioners to the World's Fair at St.
Louis and who have been appointed to
act as such at the Lewis and Clark
Exposition at Portland this year, were
before the Governor to-day making the
request that Alameda County be al
lowed space in the State building to
make a separate display and that it be
allowed to install its exhibit in its own
way and appoint representatives to su
perintend it. The committee was given
to understand that a collective exhibit
of all the products of the State would
be made and that Its request could not
be granted.
The Sacramento Valley Developement
Association has made the same request
and the San Joaquin Valley wants the
same privilege. A committee may be
appointed to confer with the Governor
and reach a satisfactory arrangement,
whereby the various localiti?s can get
the representation they desire.
BUILDERS INTERESTED.
Espey Introduces Measure Affecting

SACRAMENTO, Feb. 10.âContract

SACRAMENTO, Feb. 10.âAssembly
man Hartman has introduced a meas

colleagues are fearful will produce com
plications with the Rising Sun Empire.
It makes it mandatory upon the par
ents or guardians of all Japanese chil
dren attending the public schools of
the State to pay an annual fee of $2
each for such pupils. Hartman says
he has no wish to harass the Japanese
Government in its present predicament,
but that he believes the young Japs
should pay something for absorbing
American methods.

Measures Intended to Put an End to
the Evil Conditions in

BOISE, Idaho, Feb. 10. â The House
to-day passed the two Senate bills
[ known as the purity or Mormon meas
ures. One is a bill against polygamy,
making it punishable by fine and Im
prisonment in the penitentiary. The
other is aimed at dultery. It carries
a minimum punishment of $100, with
a maximum running up to a year in
jail or three years in the penitentiary.
There is a good deal of sentiment in
favor of an illegal cohabitation meas
ure to round out legislation on the
subject, since it is claimed a polygamy
law cannot be enforced because of the
difficulty in proving the marriage.

you my arm you would be able to

calmly, "I can walk without your aid."
On the way he stumbled once "or
twice and the officers proffered assist
ance. It "was not needed, however.
There was no weakness. McCue had
merely slipped on the frozen snow.
Watched by a silent crowd of per
haps thirty persona, McCue mounted

1 cended the scaffold with him. Tha
prisoner was placed over the trap, his
arms were pinioned and his ankle*
strapped. The black gown was folded
around him and the noose was ad-
Justed. All this while McCue'; stood
without moving. He did not utter a
word. The guard took hold of the
rope that was to release. the trap.
Rogers, standing alone upon -.the

with the kidney secretions to me i

Sometimes continence or. stoppage j
was very marked; sometimes the i
action was too often and the quan-

I had backache every now and then.
Matters had gone on like this for
some years, and although I con- !
stantly tried to get rid of the cause
I was unsuccessful until I used !
Doan's Kidney Pills. What I saw

At present the attention of the Japan

where also pass the two main roads to
Mukden. The armies are closely In
touch all along the line of Sandiapu,
Paohsingtun, Chenlianhu, Liuchang
tun and Shakhe. The region is entire
ly deserted by natives, but their stone
houses and stout walls have been turn
ed into veritable fortresses. The de
clivities have been iced and ascent
would be almost impossible, even with
out obstruction. The approaches to
the streets of the villages can be swept
by machine guns hidden behind thick
walls.

Madagascar) report that the Russian
second Pacific squadron was still there
on February 2. A dispute had arisen
between Vice Admiral Rojestvensky
and the German companies which are
coaling the fleet. The admiral, who is
well supplied with coal, wishes the col
liers to follow the fleet, but they refuse
to do so, on account of the too close
prdximity of the Japanese squadron.
The Russian ships will not leave Nos
sibe before February 28.
GENERAL OKU'S HEADQUAR
TERS, Feb. 10.â A large Russian force
remains on the right bank of thÂ« Hun

SINKING SHIP FIRE ON.
Details Given of 15 lowing IP of Jap- I
anese Cruiser.
TOKIO, Dec. 28. â Commander
Okuda, who was second in command
of the ill-fated Japanese cruiser Sai- |
yen when a Russian mine sent It to j
the bottom, has given a detailed state
ment of the disaster. His report of j
the accident follows:
The Saiyen was in Louisa Bay on Novetn
bee 20, co-operating with the army, which
was then engaged in an attack against the
enemy's stronghold on 203-Meter Hill. At 2:24
o'clock in the afternoon there was a sudden
explosion and almost immediately the ship
listed to starboard. Captain Tajima and all
of us realized at once that all hope of saving
the vessel was lost. The ship had struck one
of the enemy's mines. The mine hit below
the engine-room, killing live men on duty in i
the forward engine-room and three in the
after room. The ship took water fast, but her
captain remained on the bridpe and directed
me to take steps to save the^irew.
Ar the ship was sinking fast, I advised tho
captain to take to a boat, but he declined to
Uo so and remained at his post until death
oame to him. The enemy on Liaotin Moun
tain, observing our condition, mercilessly
poured a deadly fire on us and the comrade
ships that hurried to our rescue. The latter
had to engage In their humane task in the
face of a vigorous fire from the enemy.
The Salven erdinarlly carried five boats and
one launch, but stripped for action we had
only three of thÂ» boats, (inly two of tl>e boats
could be lowered, and into these, under com
mand of the chief paymaster and a sub-lieu
tenant, went eeventy men. When the ship
sank the captain was on the port side of the
bridge and I on the starboard side, and as
the ship listed to starboard I must have gone
before the captain. I sank deep, but gained
the surface and caught hold of a hammock,
which kept me afloat until I was picked up.
W-Wle in the water I did not fee! the cold,
which was Intense, hut I was chilled when
lifted aboard the vessel that picked me up.
Of th" rescued five died of exposure. Only
two minutes elapsed between the explosion and
the sinking, but I am glad to s=ay that no con
fusion of any kind occurred.
It v/hjÂ» due to the valor of our comrade
ships that thirteen officers, six warrant officers
and 1-40 men were rescued. Captain Tajima
md thirty others were lost. We searched for
their bodies until December 2. but did not re
cover the corpse of our beloved commander.
Lieutenant Kashlwaca. who was a good
swimmer, caught hold of an empty barrel and
evidently tried to make land, but died of ex
posure. As the ship went down our thoughts
were for our captain, and pur men cried:
"Captain, captain, whore anryou?" but the
rolling of the sea was the only response.

BUYS CHILEAN WARSHIP.
Japan Said to Have Purchased the
â  Capltan Prat.
LONDON, Feb. 11. â The Daily Tel
egraph's correspondent at Tokio says
there is good authority for the state
ment that Japan intends after the war
to establish herself in Peking as
China's principal adviser.
The correspondent adds that the
warship which Japan is reported to
have purchased is said to be the Chil
ean battleship Capitan Prat. The ne
gotiations, it is added, were conducted
through an American firm. Orders for
four large battleships have been
pTaced in England, and alÂ§o contracts
for guns to the value of $2,500,000.
The same correspondent asserts that
the Japanese ambition now is un
doubtedly to invade a small portion of
actual Russian territory, and an active
siege of Vladivostok, therefore, is ex
pected. '

LEFT DYING
OF WOUNDS
IN A CAVE
With a Bullet in His Head
Herbert Smith Baker Is
Found by Soldiers Near
Land's End Almost Dead
DECLARES HE WAS
FOOTPADS' VICTIM
Stricken Man Says That He
AYas Held Up on Monday
or Tuesday and Deserted
in the Cavern to Perish
With a bullet wound In his head and
his eyes blinded by blood clots, Herbert
Smith lay for several days in a cayÂ«
near Land's End.
The unfortunate man says he was the
victim of two highwaymen who as
saulted him, and, after taking what
money he had, carried him to the cave
to die. When found yesterday after
noon by three soldiers from Fort Mlley,
Smith was delirious irom the pangs of
thirst, and unable to stir a limb.
Dazed and on the verge of insanity
he is unable to recall whether it was
on Monday or Tuesday that the assault
took place. The bullet entered near
one of his eyes and the blood that
gushed from the wound became caked
and blinded him. Tortured by pain
the man could keep no account of time.
When p. little water and nourishment
had been given to him at the Fort
Miley Hospital Smith revived enough to
tell something of his adventures.
He was walking near Land's End
either Monday or Tuesday. Two rough
ly clad men approached him and dv
nianded his money. Smith started to
run, whereupon one of the men struck
him a stunning blow on the head with
a revolver. Smith struck back at him
and the man's accomplice fired.
Smith dropped to the sand, partly
stunned and the footpads emptied his
pockets, getting about $22. Raising
their helpless victim the pair carried
him to one of the many rocky caves in
the vicinity and left him there for dead.
Sc-me time after the assault Smith re
gained consciousness, but could not see.
He was terrorized, believing that he
had been blinded. Desperately he tried
to rise, but his limbs were numb
and he was like one stricken by paral
ysis. He shouted till his throat became
dry and parched and when he tried to
cry aloud he could only raise a husky
whisper.
Time dragged on slowly. Every hour
added to the pain in his head, thirst
choked him, and hunger gnawed at his
vitals.
Outside the cave he could hear the
water lapping noisily on the beach. The
sound added to his distress. He longed
to reach it, to cool his burning head in
it. But the rippling water only seemed !
to mock him, and with its monotonous
music in his ears he gradually lapsed
into a delirium.
At times he gave up hope, and prayed
that he might die. Then the ruling in
stinct would assert itself, and the man
would concentrate his faculties and try
to move his leaden limbs. At first he
feared the tide would reach him as he
lay helpless and gradually choke out
his life. By yesterday a merciful stupor
overcame him.
In the afternoon Privates W. T.
Looman, H. J. Royston and J. Hunter
of Fort Miley passed the cave. They
heard faint groans issuing from it and
on entering found Smith all but dead.
They bore the wounded man quickly
to the post hospital at Fort Miley.
There he was treated by Dr. Short
ridge. A little water was poured into
his parched mouth and the blood clots
j were washed from his eyes. Smith ral
lied wonderfully when his eyes were
opened, for he was certain that he had
been blinded.
His cries for water and food were
pitiful, but the surgeon could give him
only a little at a time owing to his
, weakness.
Though the man's head is in a ter
i rible condition, blackened near the
! wound, and though he is weak from ex
; posure, it is thought that he may live.
Smith was able to give a description
of his assailants. One is about 30 years
â¢ oid, 5 feet 6 inches tall, heavily set and
wore a dark mustache. He wore over
alls and a black felt hat. This one did
the shooting. The other is described as
being 5 feet 6 inches in height, smooth
i shaven and wore overalls and a felt
hat.
The police are inclined to doubt
I Smith's story, believing that he at
tempted suicide, but the soldiers found
no revolver in the cave. Smith is a
, baker, 30 years old. He gave his ad
| dress as 928 Jackson street.

LUBIN'S PLAN
FINDS FAVOR
Italians Enthusiastically
Greet His Scheme for a
Cliamter of Agriculture
TO BE INTERNATIONAL
Californian Hopes It Will
Adjust Conditions to the
Benefit of the Farmers
{ ROME, Feb.. 10.â David Lubin of
Sacramento, Cal., who has been staying
here : for. some months perfecting the
plans for the establishment lof an t in
ternational chamber of agriculture,
said to-day:
Ido not with to bÂ« interviewed, m thing
oomlnt from a Â«lnglÂ« person will diminish thÂ«
Importance of , thÂ» ; scheme, which Is and must
remain the i undertaking of ; King Victor Em
manuel, who has divined the true needs or thÂ«
people throughout the world, and who will
become, one of â¢ the greatest sovereigns In his
tory if the project Is carried out successfully.
Lubin has ', had numerous interviews
with Minister \of the Treasury. Luzzati
and prominent economists and agri
culturists. In a report on the subject
bin says:
'*. The - purpose 'of . the International CliambÂ«r
of "Agriculture Is not to create abnormal con
ditions, : but to bring about ; and maintain as
normal ,'. conditions â  which " are : now abnormal.
No i consumer should object .to paying normal
prices even If; some of them be , higher than
those now ' prevalent." ; If consumers understood
the reason for this they would not only, con
sent to pay normal prices, but would eagerly
desire It,; as. in the end: prices would become
equalized. 'â¢;
,â  ; Asked If > the end ; sought In 'â¢ the pro
posed chamber was not already met by
the ; Department . of Agriculture. Lubin
answered: * ,
; No. because the thousands of documents and
facts from throughout the world are too nu
merous to be mastered by a Minister of Agri
culture,*; he having no means at his control to
establish : the authenticity, of the facts, his Ju
risdiction-; being bounded by his own nation
and his - powers being - limited and â¢ prescribed
by law. â  He > also : has no power ;to Influence
other nations. â¢ For instance, in America the
Department of Agriculture Is unable to abol
ish the evil tendencies of trusts, combines and
mergers which mads American agriculturists
lose millions of dollars last year. But an In
ternational chamber could do : mote , than ' this.
The press comments enthusiastically
on the project of King Victor Emmanuel
to establish an international chamber
of agriculture. The Capitale says:
We cannot refrain from manifesting our
pride as Italians in a fact which will make
the name of King Victor Emmanuel applaud
ed from the Italian frontier to the country of
George Washington. â¢. .

EDITOR -HORSEWHIPPED
BY WOMAN LECTURER
Lash Piled Because or Alleged Insult
ing Criticism of an Oratorical
Effort.
CHICAGO, Feb. 10.â The Journal this
evening published the following: Julius
Liebling*. editor and publisher of the
Jewish Progress, 429 Union street, yes
terday was the victim of a. horsewhip
ping by Miss Esther Weinshenker,
national chairman of the Woman's
Zion Society.
Miss Weinshenker was angered by
an article appearing in Liebling's paper,
in connection with the report of a
speech delivered by her at a meeting
of Zionists. In this report, she alleges,
she was spoken of in an insulting man
ner.
Armed with a cowboy's whip she
went to the office of Liebling and sent
in word that he was wanted at the
door. When he appeared she struck
him several times on the face. Lieb
ling retreated to his office.
In reporting the affair to the police,

robbed by a woman and two compan
ions. With Miss Weinshenker at the
time of the attack were her brother and
an acquaintance.
CHICAGO PACKERS SECURE
CORNER IX EGG MARKET
Hold Millions in Cold Storage While
the Price Reaches High
Figure.
CHICAGO. Feb. 10.â It is estimated
that there are 45,000,000 eggs in cold
storage in Chicago. Notwithstanding
this, a famine in the product exists and
householders are paying 38 cents a
dozen. The big meat packers are said
to have a "corner" on the market. Last
spring, when eggs were cheap, the meat
packers and a few heavy dealers se
cured hundreds of thousands of cases
of eggs, which were at once put away
for a time when, owing to natural con
ditions, the market supply of fresh esjrs
would be unequal to the demand. The
eggs were bought at a price ranging
from 15 to 17 *Â£ cents per dozen.

All Work Ordered Stopped
in Kansas When Refinery
Bill 3leets With Favor
TALK OF BOODLE FUND
In Investigation, However,
Nothing Is Discovered on
Which to Base Charges
TOPEKA, Kans.. Feb. 10. â The
Legislative committee appointed to in
vestigate the rumors of Doodling in
connection with the oil refinery bill
held a meeting this evening:, but failed
to find anything; upon which to base
proceedings against any of the mem
bers.
Previous to the appointment of the
Investigating committee the support- !
ers of the measure, which provides '
for the erection by the State of an oil I
refinery, won a victory for their bill .
when they secured its reference to the
committee of the whole. The meas- j
ure already has passed the Senate
and the vote to-day referring it to ;
this committee indicates, it is believed,
that it has enough supporters to in
sure its passage by the House.
Before action was finally taken ,
there was a sensational discussion.
One member had the clerk read a
newspaper story, asserting that cer
tain oil interests were using money
to prevent the passage of the refinery
bill and saying that "some statesmen i
are under suspicion."
Speaker Stubbs, who took the floor
to move that the bill be referred to
the Judiciary Committee, said that I
the bill brought up a constitutional
question and he was in favor of going
slow until lawyers could give an opln- i
ion on it. Stubbs took occasion to de- >
nounce the Btandard Oil Company as
"the most dastardly, fiendish concern
in this country," and, continuing,
said:
It hu bean htntad in eertala quarters that
I have Interests In common with the Standard
Oil. Tha man who uttered such a statement
Uan unmitigated and malicious liar. I want
to say that thÂ» action of tho trust In cutting
the price ot crude oil Is now costing me $1000
a month. My Interest* as compared with the
Interests of tha Btata, however. Is a mera bag
atelle, and I do not regard them.
After further discussion tha bill was re
ferred to tha committee of the whola and
made tha special order for Wednesday, Feb
ruary 17.
LIMA, Ohio, Feb. 10. â General
Manager O'Day of the Standard Oil
Company's interests in Ohio, Indiana

ordered stopped in the Kansas field.
In explanation he showed the follow
ing telegram, sent to the heads of all

W. J. Young, president ot the Prairie Oil

on account of the present agitation In regard
to our business in Kansas, our credit Is being
Injured and we are unable to secure loans,
which are necessary for our company In order
to carry out the work we have contemplated
in taking caro of tho oil produced by building

MINE OWNERS
BREAK PLEDGE
Prussian Strikers on At-
tempting to Ressme Work
Find They Are Blacklisted
REDUCTIONS OF WAGES
Attitude of Employers Ex
pected to Cause Resump
tion of Industrial War
BERLIN, Feb. 11.â The morning
newspapers to-day printed dispatches
from Bochum and Essen which mdi- j
cate that the resumption of the coal j
miners' strike is highly probable. Bo
chum dispatches say news reach-
Ing the headquarters of the socialist
labor unions all yesterday afternoon of j
the blacklisting of men by the mine j
owners and that thousands of men i
were turned away with the declaration
that they never again would fee given
work. Some of the mines also are at
tempting to- enforce reduced wages as
a penalty for striking. Tha miners are
greatly incensed.
An Essen dispatch says that at a
meeting of miners on Friday evening
Herr Hue, a member of the Reichstag,
gave out the watchword "ths strike
must continue." Tbe Berlin news
papers condemn the action of the mine
owners as an incredible piece of folly.
ESSEN Prussia, Feb. 10.â The situa
tion In the coal mine strike is very
much confused. Some mines report
scarcely any increase In the number of
operatives returning to work at the
midday's shift, while others announce
a great Increase. At Krupp's mines
two-thirds of the men are working.
Other mines have applications from
great numbers of operatives. Even in
the districts where miners' meetings
voted to stay out it is believed the
strike will crumble away In a few days.
A dispatch from Hoerde, Westphalia,
says that although the strikers are dis
appointed and angry over the decision
of the delegates' conference they have
voted to follow the leaders and take up
work. A general resumption on Mon
day Is expected there.
Advices from Oberhausen indicate
that few miners have resumed work,
acting In accordance with the vot* at
Thursday's mass-meetings. Another
meeting was held to-day which, after
an exciting discussion, reiterated yes
terday's decision to stay out.
The Herne region reports a violent
attitude toward the committee. In the
Aplebrek district a strong force has
been collected to keep the peace.
HEINZE SEERS A WRIT

SIGHS FOR CERTIFICATE
Law's Delay Annoys Her
SHE FINDS THAT MARRIED LIFE
IS NOT A DREAM OF BLISS
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Mrs. Carl Urblln of Amazonian
physique and temperament had heard
of the law's vexatious delays and was
â willing; to make reasonable allowance
for tardiness due to circumlocution, but
Ehe could not help thinking it rather
strange, to say the very least, that
three weeks after her marriage she
should still be awaiting receipt of docu
mentary proof that the ceremony had
been performed. When ' the knot was
tied the officiating magistrate. Judge
Cabaniss. informed her that the certi
ficate signed by him and attested by
witnesses would be sent to her after It
had b^en legally recorded, yet she had
' cd. it, and she would like to
know why not. Perhaps she would be
mpatient if Mr. Urblin had not
rhafc-d under marital restriction and
threatened to abandon her, and if she
piven assurance that he had not
obtained n of the certificate.
and that it would be addressed to her
Dally, Fh* might manage t<Â» wait
â¢ w days longer without fur
ther sacrifice of patience.
When the desired assurance had been
n, the lady reminded the Judge
: hrst he had bÂ«-cn paid only $2 by her
husbandâ !=<> <-haractensu< of that per
-ai-dliiu-ssâand she hoped that
ihf - - of the fee was not re
siblc for the n-m-delivery of the
r,< atf . because if it were. she. al
z)\ far from being a millionaires?.
h*r. ? fully contribute whatever
tfonal sum hfs Honor might con
â  ade-quato to fairiy compensate
him for his work.
The fee was ample." said the Judge.
â  may afford you some eatisfac
nformed by me that the nup
;not binding you ana Mr. Urblin
firmly tied as if he had paid a
*If>no for it. Moreover, the certificate
shall be delivered into your hands just
p as it has passed through all the
Men such documents are
eu'nj-Â«*ted ere they are capable of what
â¢we M^ight ;f-im holding water."
Thank ;â  ou v^ry much." was the
- â¢ r sr.onse. "and I'm sure you will
c me for taking up your time, but
> "v know marriage is new to me. while
Mr. T'rblin was married twice before he
met me, and he's up to all the tricks of
divorce and things that I know nothing
about, and I was afraid tnat if he got
the certificate he would tear it up or
put it in the stove, and the nice frame
that I bought for It would be juÂ«t so
much money lo*t. You're sure $2 was
enough?"
More than enough when I add to it
tlie pleasure derived from this visit,"
Â«aÂ» the gallant reply.
â¢ Thank you ever so much and I'll
leave you my address, and don't forget
tx tell the policeman or the boy or
â whoever brings it that lt'e to be deliv
ered to me and not to Mr. Urblin."

Mrs. Emma Clarke guilty of keeping a

George Betts. alias Spring, was ac
cused of vagrancy, but Patrolmen
Dow and Dobbin, who arrested him
while he was lying under a bench in
the park panhandle, said he was a
systematic blackmailer, and Judge
Mogan held him for investigation of
character. He gave his residence as
518 Jones street and said he was a
machinist.
The officers told the Judge that they
hoped to produce proof that the de
fendant had attempted to levy black
mail on young women whose conver
sation with male escorts he overheard
while they were seated on .park
benches. One girl had agreed to so
testify if she were promised immunity
from scandal, and her testimony will
be heard in chambers.
Mrs. Bridget Johnson wore a black
straw hat with brim hooked up at the
sides and embellished with a droop
ing white p'ume when she appeared
before Judge Cabaniss to press her
charge of attempt to murder against
Roger Davis and when his Honor,
glancing at her headgear, asked if
she were a Knight Templar she bri
dled up an snappingly replied:
"No. I ain't; but I don't drink
nothln'."
The testimony showed that Mr. Da
vis fired a pistol from a window of
his dwelling on Langton street near
Howard, with evident intent to shoot
either John McDermott or Mrs.
Rohre, who were engaged In wordy
altercation beneath his lattice and dis
turbing his slumbers. Mr. Davis ad
mitted having exploded powder, but
denied that he tried to shoot anybody,
the bullet being aimed upward. Nor
did he flre the pistol, he averred, un
til after he had warned Mr. McDer
mott and Mrs. Rohre to cease their
wrangling and had also vainly sought
to summon the police by blowing a
whistle.
"A sensible man," said the Judge,
"would have remained in bed and al
lowed the exchange of epithets be
neath the window to exhaust itself."
After declaring herself a teetotaler
Mrs. Johnson informed the court that
she was married to a "square-head,"
and in response to his Honor's request
for a translation of the noun she said
her spouse was a Swede. As there
was no evidence to show that she had
been damaged by Mr. Davis' pistol
practice the case was dismissed.
Robert Powell, a stalwart negro, at
tired in military tunic and trousers,
was charged with disturbing the peace
by Alfred Riddle, also colored, and
Mrs. Morris, a comely young negress,
appeared as the woman in the case.
The alleged peace disturbance con
sisted of Mr. Riddle's forcible ejection
from the residence of Mr. Powell, at
2330 Greenwich street. In retaliation
of Mr. Riddle's intrusion and demand
that Mrs. Morris depart from the
house.
Mr. Powell, exhibiting to Judge
Cabaniss a large medal bearing a life
like portrait of Mrs. Morris, declared
that his relationship with that lady
was purely platonlc. She wan' the widow
of an army comrade whose dying be
hest was that Mr. Powell would pro
tect her. and In his capacity of pro
tector he was entertaining her at his
home when Mr. Riddle "butted in" and
provoked expulsion by his vulgar in
sinuations. Mr. Powell served as a sol
dier thirty years and was in receipt of
a pension from a grateful country. The
pension more than sufficed to keep the
wolf from his door.
"De husban' oh de lads," he said,
"tvuz mah fren' in de ahmy, en w'en
wif his dyin' href he ast me ter tek
keer ob de widder I jes cudden refuse."
Mr. Riddle declared that his sense of
social propriety was shocked by the
fact of Mrs. Morris being "favahed" by
Mr. Powell, and it was with desire to
save the lady's name from scandal that
he requested her to Rbide elsewhere
than in the Powell domicile.
The testimony is under Judicial con
sideration.
Among the eccentricities charged
against Miss Jessie Bell, a young per
son with a mass of old-gold hair, was
that of dancing upon a table in a Tay
lor-etreet rotisserie, thereby conveying
entertainment Jo some, and horror to
other beholders. She told Judge Mogan
that she recently left a happy home at
Penryn. Placer County, and liked 'fcn
derloin life so well that she had no de
sire to return to the pines. Her sen
tence for vagrancy will be pronounced
to-day.
The oculist rejoices in the man who
has an eye for business.
THE SAN FRAN-CISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 1905.
MEMORY OF LINCOLN
FITINGLY HONORED
Pu6fic Schools Entertain Veterans and
Grand Army Commemorates
the Martyr's Birthday.
The memory of Abraham Lincoln
was honored by the srSiool children
of this city yesterday afternoon and
nearly all of the public schools were
visited by members of the Grand
Army of the Republic In accordance
with a custom that has been observed
here for many years. All of the
schools had arranged for special exer
cises and in some the programmes
were particularly well selected.
One thing must ba said that reflects
great credit on the local public school
system ; the children showed that their
careful training had instilled in them
a spirit of Americanism that will be
inseparable from them through their
li'-o.s :ml * i!l be hanT"d down for
generations to come. They were en
thusiastic in their endeavors to vie
with one .-mother in paying tribute to
the man who did as much for the per
petuation of the great United States
as even the immortal Washington.
The special numbers for programme
introduced by the respective schools
were striking examples of careful,
patriotic training and earnest and ef
fective work on the part of the
scholars.
Nearly every school demonstrated a
marked degree of advancement in
musical culture. The exercises In
cluded many patriotic songs.
By courtesy of Comrade W. W.
Stone of Lincoln Post. G. A. R., the
School Department was enabled to get
the moral and practical assistance of
the Rev. W. H. Rader, Supervisor
d'Ancona and Congressman Julius
Kahn in preparing programmes.
The exercises commenced at 1:30
o'clock in nearly all of the schools
and lasted about an hour and a half.
Routine studies were abandoned for
the occasion.
LINCOLN SCHOOL EXERCISES.
Principal Hamilton Shows What His
Scholars Are Capable of Doing.
Loncoln School children decorated
the statue of "Honest Old Abe" that
stands In front of the edifice on Fifth
street near Market with small Amer
ican flags and helped place old glory
at the top of the flagstaff of the build
ing. The young ones had done this
before when they were not so old by
a year, but to honor Lincoln is a
pleasure that never dies with the
scholars of the school that bears the
name of the emancipator of the slaves.
A delegation of Grand Army vet
erans was present at the school ex
ercises. Among these was comrade
G. W. Marques of Napa, from Unity
Post, and comrades Robert Graham
and Ferdinand Kliem of Lincoln Post.

Mrs. Jennie Duffy Tells of
Flight in Night Clothes
MRS. JENNIE Dt-K-FY. WHO TELUS A STRANGE STORT OF FORCIBLE DE- I
TENTION IN AND FINAL ESCAPE!. CLAD ONLY IN HER NIGHT CLOTHES,
ntOM THE SALVATION ARMY RESCUE HOME AT BEL'I.AH.
OAKLAND, Feb. 9.â A strange story
of forcible detention and unkind treat
ment inflicted by those in charge of
the Salvation Army Rescue Home at
Beulah in Fruitvale is told by Mrs.
Jennie Duffy, an aged woman, residing
at 507 Eighth street in this city.
Mrs. Duffy says she entered the in
stitution by mistake, and that as soon
Â«.? the officers in charge discovered that
she was a skillful seamstress and was
able to make fine fancy work they took
her clothing from her and refused to
allow her to leave the home, even go
ing so far as to lock her in her room at
night.
Mrs. Duffy to-day attempted to enlist
the aid ot the police in recovering the
clothing she left at the home, but as
the institution is outside the jurisdic
tion of the city authorities, she was
told that she would have to procure the
services of the Constable of Fruitvale.
Following is Mrs. Duffy's account of
her alleged imprisonment at the Rescue
Home:
I am â¢â¦ years old and have been out of
work for several months. Ab I had a letter of
recommendation to Mrs. Carrie Judd Montgom
ery of the Orphanp" Home, at B^ulah, I de
cided about a month ago to go therr and see
whether I could get a place to etay until I
could eet work.
I left here on Tuesday. January 24, and went
out to Beulah. but the conductor made a mlF
take and stopped at the Salvation Army Home.
1 went In there before I knew it was not the
place I wae looking for. The captain in charge

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 11. 1905
rpcÂ»ived me very nicely, and I showed her
the letter I had. which mentioned among
other things that I was a skillful seamstress.
Thoy aÂ»ked me to stay there that nipht, and
1 did, but when I got up in the morning they
refused to givr me my clothes, and told mÂ«
I could not leave and that I would have to
help with the sewing.
I did not want to go away without my
clothes, but things became so bad for me at
last that 1 made up my mind to escape in
wrae way. The door of my room was locked
every night, but a week ago last Monday nipht
I made a rope of two sheets and a blanket
and got out of the window. I walked to Mills
Sf-minary, and the night watchman there got
me some clothes. Then I came to Oakland,
walking all the way, as I had no money. I
reached here about 3 o'clock In the morning,
and when I got to Mrs. Siiva's again I fell
in a faint in thp hall. In the darkness I
stumbled into a creek near the college, and
walked all the rest of the way with my clothe*
wringing wet.
The latter part of Mrs. Duffy's story
is corroborated by Mrs. Silva, who says
that she found Mrs. Duffy lying uncon
scious in the hall about 3:30 o'clock on
Tuesday morning, January 31, with her
clothing wet and muddy.
Mrs. Mills of Mills College said she
knew nothing about the woman's story.
The officers at the Salvation Army
barracks in this city say that Mrs. Duf
fy is an habitual mendicant, who has
often received aid from the army, but
that lately she has been refused assist
ance, as she was not considered de
serving. They say that she has told a
story false from first to last through
motives of revenge.

LEGISLATORS
AT UNIVERSITY
Welcome Extended by Presi
dent Wheeler, the Faculty
and Students to Guests
RECEPTION IS HEARTY
The 31en From Sacramento
Are Cordial, but Declare
That Money Is Very Scarce
. Â»
Berkeley-: Office San Francisco Call,
.;â¢;:; 2148: Center StreeU Feb. ;10.; 10. â .
Frank C. Prescott, Speaker of the As
sembly, accompanied by his wife, with
a delegation of Assemblymen, paid a
formal visit to the State University this
morning and received an enthusiastic
greeting by President Wheeler arid the
students. Harmon gymnasium was
utilized as the scene of the reception,
and there the University Cadet Band,
the "rooters," the Glee Club and the
senior women in their picturesque caps
and gowns joined in extending welcome
to the guests from the Legislature.
Originally it wa* planned that nearly
all the Legislature should visit Berke
ley to see, each man for himself, the
needs of the State University, and note
the work it is accomplishing. The press
of important business in the State Sen
ate, and particularly the bribery scan
dal, has so occupied the time of the
upper house that excuses for the Sena
tors' ntrn-attendanee had to be made on
these grounds by the legislators present
to-day.
The visitors included the following:
Speaker Frank C. Prescott, Redlands,
ex-officio regent of the university; As
semblyman \V. A. Johnstone, San
Dimas, of the University Com
mittee, and wife; Assemblyman
W. H. Waste, Berkeley, chair
man of the University Commit
tee and member of the Ways and
Means Committee; Assemblyman John
A. Goodrich, Pasadena, of the Univers
ity Committee and of the Ways and
Means Committee; Assemblyman R. H.
E. Espey, Oakland, at the University
Committee and of the Ways and Means
Committee; Assemblyman Edward F.
Treadwell, San Francisco, of the Com
mittee on Commissions and Public Ex
penditures and of the Irrigation Com
mittee; Assemblyman N. A. Hawkins,
Woodland, of the Fruit and Vine In
terests Committee.
"STRAW " IS NEEDED.
Professor Bernard Moses delivered
the address of welcome on behalf of the
faculty and W. H. Dehm spoke for the
student body, of which he is president.
Professor Moses referred to past bene
factions Of the Legislature, by which
the university has profited, and urged
their continuance. He said that bricks
are being made at the university, but
that bricks could not be made without
straw â "and you must furnish the
straw." he declared.
Speaker Prescott responded to these
addresses of welcome. He said that he
believed the office of regent and the
title to be greater than that of Speaker
of the Assembly. Referring to the
bribery scandal at Sacramento, the
Speaker said:
I hope California has seen for the last time
Its splendid front smirched with an awful
soandal. The safeguard against such a dis
grace Is up to such as you. Show that probity
and honor come from Berkeley. Convince the
r*opl<Â» of this Stiite that your institution is
turning out noble and patriotic citizens, a:ii
that none of the millions spent here ere spent
in vain.
Assemblyman Hawkins of Wood
land, who was a university student
twenty-five years ago, believed the
State would deal generously with the
university, but added that because of
many claims all that the Legislature
might desire to do for the institution
might not be accomplished.
Assemblyman Treadwell was proud
of the fact that he was president of
the alumni association of Hastings
Law College. He said it did not need
an expert eye nor even that of an
alumnus to see the present needs of
the university. He referred to the
difficulty of getting appropriations.
To accomplish this more easily, he
said, the university should be kept
close to the people's heart. So long
as it had the affection and confidence
of the public there need be no fear
about its support. He commented
upon the large number of graduates
interested in civic and state affairs and
referred to the many college men at
Sacramento, -whose loyality is one of
the university's strongest bulwarks.
Treadwell received a hearty cheer
when he told of how he refused to
introduce a bill making the State col
ors green and gold, as he believed the
State colors should be those of the
university â fclue and gold.
STUNNKD BY SCANDAL.
Assemblyman W. H. Waste brought
the regrets of the benate, which is
now, he said, occupied with its bribery
investigation. Waste said that such
Senators as Belshaw and Lukens had
approached him personally and told
him they "didn't have the heart" tto
come to Berkeley at this time. As
semblyman Waste told his hearers
that the demands for appropriations
from every part of the State were'ap
palling to the Ways and Means Com
mittee and that already the general
appropriation bill carries items call
ing for an expenditure of $15,000,000.
He said that every State institution
which requires State aid was asking
for from 15 to 20 per cent more than
was given two years ago. He feared
that a cut of claims would have to be
made all along the line and that the
university's friends might have to ac
cept a cut in university appropriation
bills, but said the institution would be
generously treated in any event.
The members of the Legislature
were entertained at luncheon by Pres
ident and Mrs. Wheeler and were ecÂ«
corted about the campus in the afterÂ«
noon, each department and building
being thoroughly investigated.

MURDER THEORY
NOT ACCEPTED
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, Feb. 10.
Investigation by the police has settled
the suspicion that Reuben Q. Collins, a
Seattle contractor, who was found dy
ing at First and Jefferson streets last
night, mifeht have been murdered. De
tectives found nothing to indicate foul
play. On Collins' person was a dia
mond studded gold watch and a purse
full of greenbacks. His clothing was
undisturbed. It was covered with mud
and oil.
The Injured man was found at the
side of the Southern Pacific Com
pany's track on First street by the en
gineer of an Alameda local train.
Whether Collins was struck by the
train or fell from another one has not
been definitely settled. Neither has it
been learned what the stranger was
doing when he met with the fatal in
iury.
Collins' head was badly crushed, an
injury that might have been caused by
a fall from a moving train or by being
struck by the engine. He was uncon
scious when picked up and did not re
gain his senses.
He had been here on a business trip
and was in correspondence with tho
American Bridge Company. He was a
member of the firm of Gerrick, Collins
& Gerrick of Seattle. Coroner Mehr
macn to-day received word from John
Gerrick, senior member of the firm, to
hold the body pending the arrival of a
. man from the north to take charge of
the remain?.

WOMAN MAKES
GRAVE CHARGE
Sequel to Elopement of Aged
Mrs. Werren With a Man
of One Half Her Years
HUSBAND IS ACCUSED
Wife Says He Shot Her Last
Year When She Reported
Kobber Was to Blame
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call.
2148 Center street, Feb. II
Confession was made to-day by Mrs.
IJzette Werren, who returned to her
husband's home in North Berkeley yes
terday after eloping with Fred Trosch.
that the sensational ghooting affair at
the Werrens' road resort a year ago
was really a murderous attack by Wer
ren upon her. She declares that thÂ«
ghastly wound in the breast which she
received at the time, supposedly from
a highwayman's rifle, was really from
a gun in the hands of her angry hus
band.
Mrs. Werren's accusation contradicts
the story she gave to the authorities at
the time of the shooting, in April, 1904,
when she declared that a masked high
wayman had covered her with a rifle,
demanding that she give up the money
In the till and safe. Neglect to obey
the highwayman's command resulted,
she then said, in the firing ot a bullet
which penetrated her breast.
Now the woman has been repulsed
by a wronged husband, whose forgiVi
ness she begged, after eloping with
their boarder and losing nearly all of
the savings bank hoard the Werrena
had accumulated in thirty years. But
she declares that Werren has always
abused her that he forced her to work
in the fields and that hia abuse cul
minated a year ago in the attack upon
her with a rifle, which almost resulted
In death. Werren scoffs at the woman's
story, which was told to a group of
men at the door of her husband's re
sort in the hills to-day, and says that
she will probably tell a different story
to-morrow.
"You are crazy, woman," he called to
Mrs. Werren, as she sat rocking on his
porch, white-faced and in despair be
cause Werren had declined to admit
her again to his home. To the by
standers Werren explained that his
wife had turned on him in fury when
he refused to give her the place of wife
again.
"It was not possible for me to shoot
my wife," declared Werren, "for on
that night I did not even have a rifle
on the place. Mra. Werren was at
tacked by a robber, who shot her in the
breast, and I had absolutely nothing to
do with it."
Mrs. Werren remained at her hus
band's home to-day despite his an
nouncement th^at she could no longer
be his wife. She has no kin in this
country anÂ«J says that she will remain
at the Werren resort unless driven
away by her husband.

GRAND JCRY ON HFNT
FOR BOODLJNG CASFS
Witnesses From Bui Kline and Loan
Association Fail to Give Any
Tangible Evidence.
The Grand Jury was engaged yes
terday afternoon In Investigating alle
gations that it has been a common
practice on the part of building and
loan associations to raise corruption
funds In years past to influence legis

None of those called could give any
definite testimony as to boodling. They
offered their surmises that Influence
had been brought to bear in some way

'â .hedule time, but a day longer on
the Â«ay thaji usual, the Occidental and
1 'riemal Steamship Company's liner
Coptic, Captain William Finch, arrived
<-ariy yesterday morning from the Far
Kast. As far as Honolulu the Coptic
made her usual time, but heavy weath
( r encountered after leaving the island
mpeded the liner's speed and in-
Ftead of reaching this port early on
Thursday it was 6 o'clock yesterday
morning before she passed in through
the heads.
Captain Finch, formerly commander
of the Gaelic, recently released from
her O. and O. charter, assumed com
mand of the Cootie at Shanghai, re
lieving Captain Beadnell, who was
transferred to the Gaelic.
The Coptic brought 2300 tons of
freight, seventeen cabin passengers and
a large number of Japanese laborers
under contract to work in Mexico for
three years at 65 cents a day. Four
Japanese women were refused a land
ing by the immigration authorities.
They are all afflicted with trachoma.
Among- the passengers were Mrs. J.
M. Bell, wife of General Bell, who has
been making a tour of the world; T. R.
Henderson, a hemp planter from Ma
nila; W. J. Wood, an attorney from ;
Manila, and Magosaburo Miyajima,
' who comes here to take a position with
the Yokohama Specie Bank.
The Coptic's cargo included 851 bales

The Gray P.ros.* rock barge, which a few
â¢lays p-fo blocked the fairway oft the Pacific
>?ail wharf and delayed the mailing of the
I>oric for nearly an hour, was again in the
way yesterday and prevented the liner Coptic
from reaching her berth. The harbor author
it ic-s were notified that the barge had been
aacttorad in such a ay as to obstruct com
."ueree, but. as belor*. no attention was paid
t" vho notification and the Coptic had to an-
< !:or in the stream while the tvs Arab- towed
the bargi' away. The Coptic's mall and pas
sengers were delayed more than an hour by
the obstruction.
\ New Quarantine Bartc.
Bids were opened yesterday for the construc
tion of a new fumigating barge for use at
l!*e Federal Quarantine Station at Angel Island.
AY. A. Boole & Son Company was the low
Â«st bidder, and the barge will be built at the
Boole Alsmctla shipyard. The barge is to be
V\<) fr^t long, .16.7 feet beam and 7 feet deep.
It will cost about $10,000. It will be fitted
vith modern appliances for fumigating the
holds enii oahlns of 'an liners. The liners
jiow coming to this port are 510 large that it
}fc not deemed advisable to take them along-
PidÂ«? the old liulk Omaha, on board which the
present fumigating plant is installed. The
now barge will be kept at Argcl Island, and
when the necessity arise?" for fumigating: onÂ«
of the bisr vessels the barge will be towed
alongside the victim and its batteries turned
loose on the imoorted germs. The Omaha
will be retained and used for fumigating
f-mallcr craft, which can safely be taken along
side.
Bids will coon be invited for the construc
tion of h quarantine cutter to be used in con
n'v-tion with 4he men fc*tÂ«'Â»til>Â»ia. The new
ruitÂ»T will be larger and faster than the Stern
bÂ«-rg. which will be retained, however, as a re
lirf boat for her new and swifter sister.

POLICE RAIDS
ARE ILLEGAL
Judge Hebbard Decides That
Besorts Cannot Be En
tered Without a Warrant
ENLABGES INJUNCTION
Bestrains Authorities From
Blockading Entrance to
Dive on Jackson Street
Not only has Judge Hebbard declined
to dissolve the restraining orders which
prevent the police, shrievalty and
Grand Jury from raiding the notorious
resorts at 620 Jackson street and in j
Belden place, but he has enlarged the i
' injunction to include a prohibition of j
' the police from blockading the entrance j
to Ravani's cigar store and the side- I
I walk in front thereof, from molesting |
his customers by threats of arrest and J
from arresting persons entering or |
| leaving the place, unless armed with a J
! warrant of law. As Ravani's store is
j in the entrance to the Jackson-street
: reso-rt, the inmates, though judicially
j declared immoral, are immune from po
j lice interference unless caught in the
â  act of violating the ordinance govern- j
ing their crime, or unless the bluecoats
present the proper order for arrest.
Judge Hebbard's decision is handed
j down in a written opinion covering
: nineteen typewritten pages and it dis
! poses temporarily of the cases of Ra
vahl, the cigar-store keeper, who com
plained that the police were ruining
his business at 620 Jackson; of Edward
| Moran, who complained that, as a
: ludger at the number named, he was
j driven from his home by the police
: sledge-hammer raids, and of filysa
â  Malenoire and seven others who com
j plained that in the crusade against
j vice, the authorities infringed upon
their property rights as licensed lodg
; ing-house keepers in Belden place. The
i oc-Urt overruled the demurrers to the
complaints, denied the motions of the
District Attorney to dissolve the in
junctions, enlarged the injunction in
Ravani's case, as pleaded for .by Hen
ry Ach, and gave the defendants â the
Chief of Police, Mayor, District Attor
ney, Sheriff and Grand Jury â ten days
! in w liich to answer.
During the hearing the court found,
: and reiterates in the opinion, that the
j houses named in the complaints are
I used for immoral purposes. Two ques
i tions of law remained: First, as to the
jurisdiction of a court of equity to in
terfere in such cases; second, as to the
right erf policemen or citizens to
attempt to make arrests for misde
lneanors not committed within their
view, and without writ or warrant.
Says the opinion: "The determina-*
tion of these issues by the court is
warranted by abundant citations from
adjudicated cases in many States of
the Union and by text book authority,
as well as by decisions of this court."
QUOTES OTHER OPINIONS.
Then, the opinion proceeds to cite
"the abundant authorities" and to
quote at least three important decisions
in full. First of the latter is Judge
Murasky's opinion in the case where
the police, without warrant, entered the
track of the Pacific Coast Jockey Club
to make arrests for pool selling and
bookmaking and the court held that the
authorities should be enjoined, and that
a court of equity had jurisdiction in
such cases. Next was the opinion of
Judge Seawell in the case of Marie
Paris wherein, for the same reasons,
the police were enjoined from blockad
ing Bacon place and interfering with
the business of a "restaurant and
boarding-house" on that street by
threatening the persons who passed
through it with arrest.
The third opinion quoted was that of
Judge Gaynor of the New York Su
preme Court wherein there is an ethical
analysis of police activity in cases of
thi.Â« kind. <'ulled from the Gaynor
opinion are the following paragraphs
which Judge Hebbard thought worth
giving in full:
If the officers sfatiom-d at thÂ» plaintiff's
rUrÂ« were put to patrolling the street and ar
resting all buc!i women there would very room
be no soliciting there. It cannot exist except
by sufferance of the. police. And if the de
fondant has evidence, as he claims, that the
plaintiff is violating the law. his duty and the
CUUKC prpsorilvd to him by law is to cause
the plaintiff's arrest and conviction. One such
L-ottVictiag would b<^ more whclfsomc and do
more to prevent such offenses than any amount
of unlawful violence.
It may be that the plaintiff is breaking the
law. but the law does not â confer arbitrary
power on the defendant to deal with him. The
defendant is not an official of unlimited powers.
We have no such officials in this country. No
police official can be suffered to take the law
into his own hands. When he does so he be
comes the most dangerous of criminals. He
cannot decide any one to bo guilty and proceed
to destroy him, as the deft-mlant has done in
this case.
All gcod citizens want to see outward order
and decency enforced, and will support the po
!ice in doing it in the efficient manner which
the law prescribes, but most of them know the
inevitable result of extortion and blackmail
which comes from police officials being suffered
to go beyond their powers. That some zealous
persons, to whom the word vice has only one
meaning, do not see this is much to be regret
ted. They 6eem to be altogether unconscious
that by encouraging police officials to resort to
lawless force they are themselves aiding and
abetting a far greater and more dangerous
vies than any which they are so zealous to
suppress.
Police officials are as much bound to obey
tha law as are other people. Ths notion that
the police may violate and trample on tha
law regulating their conduct, In their effort*
or under pretense of efforts to make other
people obey the law regulating theirs. Is thÂ«
most dangerous and pernicious that ever en
tered into the heads of men. If the conduct of
this police captain should be suffered to be
come general, then our free government would
be overthrown and despotism would have taken
Its place. Officials should not be permitted to
forget that our government, like all free gov
ernments, is a government of laws and not of
men. The people do not put persons In office
to do as they please, but to keep safely within
the laws enacted for their guidance and for
the limitation of their powers. Experience has
shown from the beginning that it Is far more
important to the common weal that officials
should not be suffered to transgress the laws
limiting their powers than that even all male
factors, let alone petty offenders, should be ar
rested and convicted.
Officials who override the law and do as
they please are guilty of a vice more danger
ous to society than all the other vices and
crimes combined.
USED FOR EXTORTION.
Lawless acts like those disclosed in this case
of police officials in the city of New Tork
have been used for years to extort millions of
money and enable such officials to retire cne
after another with great wealth. So-called
"raids" without warrants, and threats thereof,
have been the efficient means oT effecting such
extortions.
Judge Hebbard also quoted at some
length from Vicker's work on "The
Powers and .Duties of Police Officers
Â»nd Coroners," In which the following
is the most significant paragraph in its
relation to the present case:
If these ordinances were enforced regularly
and steadily they would be amply sufficient,
and resort need not be had to the ' sudden
employment of a dozen officers to enter a
house seize all persona found there, for pur
poses' not far removed from blackmail, and
then relax all vigilance and discontinue all at
tention to that house, although its character
is well known, until another swoop has been
resolved on, another squeeze of the inmates'
purses made, and another period of quiet per
mission to continue its existence granted to the
house. This permission, may be longer or
shorter, and more or less complete, according
as certain officers are or are not compensated
by the keepers of the house for the permission.
Proper complaint should be made and continue
to be made, and warrant Issued, except in
these cases where acts dangerous to the -public
peace are committed or threatened in the pres
ence of an officer.

SATURDAY FEBRUARY 11, 1905
THE ACTION OF THE SENATE.
THE proceedings in the case of the State Senators accused
of bribery are of present and continued interest of the keen
est sort. The case stands alone in our legislative history:
There were no precedents to serve as a guide. The State law,
which has focused the whole legal aspect of the case, was made
for the purpose of exposing and punishing the crime of which the
four Senators are accused. It offers immunity from judicial punish
ment to men in the position of Jordan, who act as the agents of
bribe-taking legislators, or to men also, who, under threat of black
mail or cinch, pay bribes for immunity.
But under the obvious reading of the law it gives immunity
also to the bribe-taker, provided he go before a committee of the
body to which he belongs and make oath to his innocence. We
think this is the proper legal construction of the statute, though it
can hardly have been tjie intention of its framers that it should
be so. This put upon the Senate the most serious responsibility
that can engage it? attention. Senator Belshaw, chairman of the
committee of investigation, has conducted himself with conspicuous
ability and level headedneÂ«<=. and when the committee found itself
confronted by the responsibility of letting the men escape by quali
fying as witnesses in their own behalf, he took the proper view
that judgment was a function of the whole Senate, to which the
committee must go for instruction.
Then ensued a debate in the Senate that becomes permanently
historic. The resolution of Senator Lukens, instructing the com
mittee not to hear the accused Senators as witnesses, the substi
tute offered by Senator Simpson and the amendment to the Lukens
resolution offered by Senator Shortridge, put every possible phase
of the issue before the Senate. The arguments that followed un
fortunately cannot appear at length in the journal of the Senate,
which is merely a skeleton of roll-calls and the text or number of
bills and resolutions, not clothed with the flesh of argument that
would make it the record of the reasons why members act as
shown by their votes, or the measures they propose.
But this debate will doubtless be preserved in more complete
form than in the abbreviated press reports. It carries the full ex
â >n of the two views of construction of the statute of immunity,
and a third most interesting view in the constitutional argument of
Senator frish. The debate was not a dry legal combat. It was
characterized by all of the emotions that rise in a crisis affecting
the personal fate of fellow men. the purity of public life and the
honor of the Senate. That it had in it also plain signs of emotions
quite different in their origin may appear to the keen observer.
was no confusion as to where the line lay, on
cither side of which Senators could align themselves with honor.
Senators who held that the Senate itself had the power of punish
by expulsion, and that such penalty was the heaviest that
could be imposed, acted from a very proper and lofty view of the
dignity of the Senatorial office. Expulsion for bribery is, in the
of honorable men. a stain ineffaceable. So Senators are 'not
<Â»pen to reprehension because they put into their votes a conception
that docs them honor.
the other hand, the majority, that refused immunity to
faring the views of those who regarded expulsion as
capital punishment for the crime charged, looked further and fixed
their eyes upon the rights of the people who are not Senators,
horn the accused men would be enlarged under no legal
lity and able to claim that nothing was legally proved against
them, and they wt re the victims of persecution and the zeal of
the press. This is a straighter view than any and its justification
'.ween the two views the people may make choice without
gning motives any further than is justified by the expressions
of Sei themselves. The speech of Senator Selvage stands
and be must answer for it alone. District Attorney Seymour
- duty and kept his official oath. If the District Attor-
Sacnunento County is to be restrained in his official duty
ar of personal harm or of personal abuse, then the stately
capital building may become a den of thieves and the people will
have no recourse. Mr. Seymour had been watchful of the public
interest and had guarded the rights of the commonwealth. The law
ther watchman with those functions. When Senator
Selvage denounced him he denounced the law and its executors
and attempted to discredit a co-ordinate branch of the State gov
ernment. Senator Ward's reply, strengthened by its manner, was
a fine example of the noble rhetoric of understatement.
From the dramatic picture must not be omitted the speech
in his own behalf made by Senator Enunons, one of the accused,
-closed a remarkable self-poise and an intellectual subtlety
no less remarkable and will cause wonder that the qualities that
it revealed could be associated with a lower range of sentiment.
In view of the charge against him and the proofs, one may well
exclaim, in pity and surprise: "How art thou fallen, Lucifer, son
oi iho mornir
The movement of this dramatic incident in the Senate, the
arguments and the sentiments which covered the gamut of emo
tion and impulse, form a chapter that is complimentary to the Sen
ate of California. It had to deal with a question that is always
the most delicate and the most difficult under our scheme of gov
ernment â the mixture of legislative prerogative and judicial right.
Senators acquitted themselves well in the great debate, and out of
isgrace and personal degradation comes a higher estimate of
the honor and capacity of the Senate of California.
THE SUNDAY CALL MAGAZINE.
T MORROW in the Sunday Call Magazine will begin one of
the greatest literary features of the year â the uncompleted por- ]
tion of the last novel written by the late Benjamin Disraeli,
Lord Beaconsfield. The unfinished novel deals with London politics
and society, and has for its center figure that other great English
statesman and bitter personal and political enemy of Disraeli, Glad
stone. The work is given just as Disraeli left it, in the midst of a
paragraph, after some fifteen thousand words had been written. Just
how Disraeli would have handled his characters and worked out his
plot can never be known, but the work as it stands, because of the
fame of the author, will always have a high place in literature as
one of the greatest of posthumous literary fragments. The owners
of the American copyright paid to the Disraeli executors the tre
mendous price of one dollar per word for each of the 15.000 compos
ing the fragment. In connection with the story The Sunday Call
offers a cash prize of $50 to the writer submitting the best conclu
sion to the novel within ten days after its publication. A conclusion
is desired that is plausible, readable and interesting. It will be run j
as the prize fiction story for the week of its appearance.
"The Honorable Burglar" is the title of the prize story for the
week, from the pen of Clarence Ludlow Brownell, author of "The
Heart of Japan" and many other Japanese stories. It is a dainty
little story and a delightful picture of how love came to the heart of
â¢'Spring Blossom." Other features of interest will be 'The Phono

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 1905
WITH A BEAUTIFUL LIVING MODEL AN AUTHOR ENACTS
THE VARIOUS SCENES OF HIS NOVEL.
THE WRITER, THE MODEL AND THE WIFE WHO DIDN'T CARE.
A STORY built on a psychological study of emotions
and passions, with a living model on which to "try
out" the parts, and a faithful portrayal of personal
experiences in love making, is what Clarence Wil-
bur Taber of Evanston, 111., is bringing out, says the
Chicago Inter Ocean.
The heroine, known to the stage as Alice Moulton,
has been transferred through the aid of psychology and
realism to the pages of a bound volume, and in the world
of letters is a unique production.
In order that this may be done love scenes, a passion
ate proposal of marriage, the first awakening of two
affinities in the soft moonlight, the rage of a jealous
man and a disappointed sweetheart have for the pur
pose of procuring realism been acted out, like a play
between the author and his model. In his own home, at
3 017 Ridge court, in the presence of his wife, Clarence
Wilbur Taber says he put himself in the position of his
various male characters while his beautiful model, prop
erly costumed, placed herself in the position of the fe
male characters.
Taber understood the part he wanted to emphasize
and with hard study and continuous application his
model assimilated her portions of the story. Each mem
THE LONG LANE
THE room was unlighted save
for the fire on the hearth,
which snapped and crackled
and sent weird, distorted
shadows about the walls.
Barrington sat near the fire, which
lighted his heavy features uncannily
and showed plainly the drawn, hard
lines about his mouth. Barbara Allen
had withdrawn to the shadows of a
far corner and divided her time be
tween a playful Angora kitten and co
vert glances in the young man's direc
tion. Kow and again, as his brows
knit in an angry frown, she smiled
knowingly as she smoothed the kit
ten's silky coat.
Presently the young man whirled
about in his chair and glared into the
gloom of the corner where the girl's
face was barely visible.
"I suppose," said he with bitter sar
casm, "that I should have known from
the beginning where we would come
out with this little affair of ours. I
suppose I should have taken warning
from the countless predecessors who
have tempted fate before me. But a
man in love is blind to many things,
and I find I've been no exception to
this general rule."
The girl in the corner bent over the
kitten, but made no reply. Barrington
kicked back an ember which hurtled
from the fire aoid continued:
"I didn't think you were that sort
of a girl. I fondly imagined, in my
blessed innocence, that you had some
spirit of fairness. I find I've been mis
taken â and more."
"Be careful, Fritz," she said warn
ingly. "You're saying some rather
hard things."
He laughed roughly. "It's hardly
the time to mince matters," said he.
"I'm well aware that the truth Isn't
always pleasant to hear, but I think
you'll admit yiere are times when cir
cumstances warrant its utterance. You
have known from the first that I was
honest and sincere. You knew I was
no trifier. You might, at least, have
let me know from the outset that my
case was hopeless, instead of dragging
it on in this wretched fashion."
The girl sighed patiently.
"I've merely tried to be nice â in a
friendly way," she protested.
"Oh, you've succeeded admirably,"
said he. "You've been very, very nice.
It was necessary to do that to keep me
In line, I suppose?"
"Kindly be a trifle considerate,"' she
said coldly.
"Do you deserve consideration?" he
asked.
"Perhaps not," she said with a
meekness that fanned the fires of his
wrath.
"I tell you," he declared, "it's a dan
gerous game you play, and some time
orized the part assigned and then went through the mo
tions. These included love making, kisses, caresses,
weepings and moments of bliss.
The daring model who essayed to aid the author in
his work permitted herself to be first embraced, then
repulsed and finally struck to the floor in the frenzy of
his angry passion, and then, in order not to lose any of
the effect, Taber rushed like a madman from his house,
across fields, down the road and did not return until the
psychologically produced passion wore off.
Taber's wife is a domestic little woman, whose chief
pride is in her home, her children, her husband and his
success. With beating heart and hopeful spirit she
watched all that took place and feels sure that he can
not fail.
"Did you not feel just the slightest, smallest bit of
jealousy when your husband practiced with his model?"
she was asked.
"Jealousy, nonsense! What do you mean? Why, he
was trying his very best to write something worth while,
and how else could he write? He could not describe
what he had not experienced. My, my, I am just as
interested as I can be and always have been. I didn't
care a fig. Why should I?"
THOMAS G. FESSENDEN
"Well, good-by," he said.
It will go against you. There'll come
a time when the glove will be on the
other hand. It's a long lane that has
no turning."
The rapid succession of metaphors
eet her smiling again. She leaned for
ward in her chair.
"And at the turn of the lane â what
then?" she asked.
He frowned savagely at the fire.
"At the turn of the lane," said he,
"you'll see It all from my present per
spective. You'll know what it is to love
honestly â only to provoke laughter."
She stroked the kitten thoughtfully.
"Fritz," she said, with a little note
of awe â whether real or mocking he
could not decide â in her voice, "you
frighten me."
"It will come," he saia flatly.
He rose and picked up his hat and
coat. ,He loomed up tall and forbid
ding in the flickering firelight
"I'm going now," he said, "but before
I do I want to ask a favor of you.
Don't treat the next chap as you've
treated me."
Barbara rose, too. She spilled the
Ritten on the floor and came over to
Barrington's side.
"We're friends, aren't we?" she asked
anxiously.
"Yes, we're friends," he said.
"You won't forget me because of
thisâ you won't let this be a barrier be
tween us?" she asked.
He looked down at her and smiled
slowly.
"We'll be friends," he said enigmat
ically.
The truth of the situation dawned
on her suddenly. It left her a trifle dis
mayed.
"You don't mean you're not coming
here again? You don't mean you'll
avoid me?" she asked. â¢
"I think it is the only way to insure
our friendship," said he.
"Oh!" She said, in sudden contrition.
He drew himself up with an effort.
"Well, good-by," he said, holding out
his hand.
The girl seemed not to notice it. She
leaned against a chair.
"Good-by!" he said again.
"Don'tâ don't goâ like this," she said
in entreaty.
He looked at her questioningly, then
strode to the door.
"Don't go!" she whispered weakly.
He turned. "Why not?" he demand
ed abruptly.
She flushed and hesitated. She saw
it was too late to retreat.
"Well," she said, looking into the
fire, "there's a turn !n the lane, you
know, andâ and I think we've reached
it now, Fritz, dear."â (Copyright, 1905,

CLEARING-HOUSE â A Reader.
City. The bank clearing-house in San
Francisco is located at 211 Sansome
street. A clearing-house is a plac*
where the settlement of mutual claims
is effected by the payment of differ
ences called balances. Clerks from each
bank attend the clearing-house with
checks and drafts, usually called ex
change on the other banks belonging x->
the clearing-house. These exchanges
are distributed by messengers to thÂ«
banks, which must pay them. Each
bank in turn receives from all other
banks the exchanges they bar* re
ceived on it and which must bÂ« paid.
The exchanges which a bank takes to
the clearing-house are called creditor
exchanges; those which it receives are
called debtor exchanges. If the cred
itor exchanges of a bank exceed the
debtor exchanges it Is a creditor bank
and must be paid the balance; if the re
verse it Is a debtor bank and must pay
the balance. These are paid to the
clearing-house, which in turn makes
settlements each day. The details dif
fer in the different clearing-houses.

PROMISE MILLIONS
Hundreds of Miles of Fuel Are Re
ported to Be Available for
California's Use.
At the State Mining Bureau yester
day there were placed on exhibition
samples of combined California prod
ucts, in which, it is said, reside the
possibilities of great and wide-spread
ing results. The exhibits are Califor
'ust^ peat and California crude petro
leum. The peat, a porous, absorbent
substance, has been thoroughly satu
rated with petroleum from the ex
haustless fuel supplies of the Kern
raver district. It will burn. The crude
petroleum, united with the peat, in
creases the inflammability of the first
mentioned substance. Together they
constitute a new sort of fuel, which, if
- expectations are fulfilled, may be a
very great factor in the future domes
tic and industrial life of California
and save many millions of dollars.
Information has been largely de
rived at the State Mining Bureau from
E. Woltmann. who says he is informed
concerning the extent of the existence
o! peat in this State and also to be en
tirely conversant regarding its proper
ties as fuel. Woltmann has told the
.^uue Mineralogist that the supply of
I>eat in the San Joaquin Valley along
the San Joaquin River Is beyond com
mutation. The levees that extend many
miles on both sides of the San Joa-
River and also the protecting
kvees that surround islands in the
San Joa<juin River are made almost
< atirely of peat- It is generally sup
posed that the material that levees are
made of in California is mud, but
U â ^.ann says he cannot be mistaken
v lien he asserts that they are peat
levees.
In the first place this Question has
bten settled by burning samples of
the peat that have been taken from
several Ban Joaquin localities. In the
eecond place Mr. Woltmann says that
in the part of Germany where he
once lived the only fuel known was
peat, and he knows peat when he sees
i:. For many ( yeafs peat had been
fcund in sufficient quantity to satisfy
the local German demand and there
v.as promise of enough to last for a
great many years near his boyhood's
home.
The somewhat staggering proposi
tion is therefore suggested. If Mr.
Woltmann makes no mistake in this
matter, that for centuries to come,
possibly, California will have for the
picking up and for the slight expense
cf pumping oil from the prolific wells
of a vast territory, a fuel that can be
used in manufacturing and in domestic
stoves and ranges and in the furnaces
of locomotives and steamships. Each
of the two materials supplements the
other in the making of the new com
bustible.

A FELDOW FEEDING.
Why She Pelt Lenient Toward the
Drunkard.
A great deal depends on the point of
view. A pood temperance woman was
led, in a very peculiar way, to revise
her somewhat harsh Judgment of the
poor devil who cannot resist. his cups
and she is now the more charitable.
She writes:
"For many years I was a great suf- '
ferer from asthma. Finally my health
got so poor that I found I could not lie
down, but walked the floor whilst oth-
ers slept. I got so nervous I could
not rest anywhere.
"Specialists told me I must giro ! up
the use of coffee â main thins: that !
I always thought gave me somÂ« relief.
I consulted our family physician, and
he, being a coffee fiend himself, told
me to pay no attention to their advice. â¢
Coffee had such a charm for me that !
in passing a restaurant and getting a !
â whiff of the fragrance I could not re-
sist a cup. I felt very lenient toward
the drunkard who could not pass the:
raloon. Friends often urged me to try j
Postum, but I turned a deaf ear. Bay- j
ing That may do for people to whom j
coffee is harmful, but not for me â j
coffee and I will never part.'
"At last, however, I bought a pack-
age of Postum, although I was sure I
could not drink it. I prepared it as
directed, and served It for breakfast. :
Well, bitter as I was against it, I must :
i?ay that never before had I tasted a |
more delicious cup of coffee! From 1
that day to this (more than 2 years) !
I have never had a desire for the old
coffee. My health soon returned: the
asthma disappeared. I began- to sleep 1
well and in a short time I gained 20 j
pounds in weight.
"One day I handed my physician the
tablets he had prescribed for me. tell-
ing him I had no use for them. He j
stayed for dinner. When I passed him 1
his coffee cup he remarked # I am triad I
to seÂ« s*ou were sensible enoueh not to
lpt yourself be persuaded that coffee
was harmful. This is the best cud -of j
coffee I ever drank,' he continued: 'the ]
trouble Is so few people know how to j
make good coffee.' When he ' erot his !
second cup I told him he was drinkiner
Postum. He was incredulous, but .I :
convinced him, and now he uses noth- j
ing but Postum In his home and has ;
preatly improved in health." '"Name !

T^ook In each packaere for the famous
little book "The Road to Wellville." J
prived of its by-products, is BtiU all
that is needed to add to the inflamma
bility of the peat and to increase its
heat-giving capacity. Peat, by itself,
does not blaze, but smolders. So it hap
pens that when a peat bog gets on fire
thÂ« only visible sign to denote the fact
is found in heat waves which may be
seen rising from the bog. The fire burna
until the material is consumed. Ire
land and Germany were both Instanced
by Woltmann to show the practical use
of the fuel. In his opinion a greater
amount of heat can be produced by the
union of peat and petroleum than by
crude petroleum and of course the
quantity of material to burn is in
definitely stretched by the use of the
peat.
PEAT FIFTEEN FEET DEEP.
One remark that Mr. Woltmann
made is calculated to attract atten
tion for its significance. He estimated
that the peat in the San Joaquin Val
ley may be fifteen feet deep. On this
basis one square mile of peat bog
will be found to contain millions of
tons of peat all of the same general
fuel-providing nature.
Once more, the California petro
leum miners, who have been able to
marshal a great array of statistics
based on reasonable estimates, may
again be justified in making large fig
ures to show how the consumption of
the native crude fuel oil may be in
creased and the mnrket demand cor
respondingly augmented. There are
i,-irp-ei ,-irp-e oil fields in Kern; Fresno and
Kings counties, and in several coun
ties in Southern California, in which
work is proceeding with only enough
to supply the present demand and to
keep sufficient oil in tankage to meet
cfells as they are made.
The idea of hundreds of miles of
fuel beds lying unsuspected in Cali
fornia on the surface and in view of
all for half a century would be more
surprising were it not for the fact
that nearly every large industry in
the State is based on discoveries of
conditions in soil and climate that for
a long term of years were not even
imagined.
Any one â¢who wishes can see the
California peat at the State Mining
Bureau, free of charge, as the entire
exhibit is open to the public every
secular day in the year, holidays ex
cepted. The peat samples are In

WORKING GOLD MIXES.
The snow in the mountains still in
terferes with mining operations in
certain districts. As has been, here
tofore said, the water supply for the
season figures less in the calculation
of large mining operators than it did
formerly. The bitter controversies
with water companies are consequent
ly ]es>s frequent than formerly. Elec
tric power is taking the place of wa
ter in large mines and electricity
works the dredgers near the rivers.
Concerning the resumption of op
erations of the Polar Star mine the
Grass Valley Union says:
There Is but little doubt of the reopening of
tbe Polar Star mine. W. W. Byrnes, one of
thÂ« owners oX the property, who la also con
nected with the company behind the move,
stated i that . the papers | bad â  all been
drawn up and that he had concluded to make
thÂ« necessary transfer so that work could be
commenced soon. .
The company, he stated, composed mainly
of New York men. Is very anxious to start
work Immediately. The only objection to re
suming at once is the extra amount of water
which will have to be handled In the next two
months without any particular advantage and
at a heavy extra cost. It Is the Intention to
replace the present wood burning system with
oil burners, thus obtaining better results.
Thomas Warden, a former Grass Valleyan,
who has be*n superintendent of the Minnie
Healy mine of litigation fame, has been chosen
lor the same position with the Polar Star. J.

terests In the Northwest, will also manage

CONVICT LE BAJROJT
IS HELD TO AJTSVVKR
PosltivdT Identified bj Three Persons
ag the Man Who Had Passed
Several Raised Bills.
William Le Baron, alias Howard,
ex-convict, was held yesterday to an
swer before the United States Grand
Jury on a charge of having passed
several one-dollar silver certificates
raised to 520 certificates by pasting in
the higher numbers cut from Confed
erate bills. United States Commis
sioner Heacock flxed Le Baron's ball
at $3000. in default of which he was
taken to the County JaiL
At the preliminary examination yes
terday the prisoner was identified pos
itively by Mrs. Emma Pontet, mis
tress of a lodging-house on Third
etreet; Miss Antonine Bouisson of Clay
end Stockton streets, and J. H. Men
sing, grocer, McAllister and Polk
streets. During the examination of
these witnesses Le Baron sat with a
defiant sneer on his lips. The United
States Secret Service agents have an
impregnable case against him. They
had been on his trail for several
months. On October 28 Secret Service
Agent Thomas B. Foster showed some
of the raised bills to Charles Dase
king and advised him to send for the
I-olice should Le Baron or any other
person attempt to pass similar bills
upon him. The prisoner appeared at
Daseking-'s store last Saturday night
and offered one of the bills. Dase
li'ng. upon the pretext of going out for
change, went next door and tele
phoned for a policeman. Upon being
told that the bill had been raised Le
Baron attempted to escape, and Dase
kinj? Pfized him. They were struggling
â¢rately when the policeman ar- j
rived. J
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 1905.
LUCKY HUSBAND
PRODUCES WILL
Mrs. Hoover Makes Many Be
quests, but Leaves Only
One Dollar to Her Sister
DEED TO RICH REALTY
Harry Poole's Mother Con
veys Property to Third
Spouse Before She Dies
If she does not look upon it as a joke,
lira. Louise Bee may take a notion to
contest the will of her sister, Mrs. Ma
rie B. Hoover, who died on January
22, the reputed owner of about $220,-
COO worth of realty. No other pro
bate proceedings having materialized,
Airs. Bee two days ago concluded to
apply for letters of administration on
her sister's estate. Her petition was
filed by Attorney Bert Schlesinger, and
in it she recited that Mrs. Hoover was
the owner of a half-interest in the
property .at the corner of O'Farrell
and Stockton streets, had left no will
and her only heirs were the petitioner,
her sister, and the widower, George S.
Hoover.
Yesterday Hoover's attorneys, Sulli
van & Sullivan, to prevent Mrs. Bee
from acquiring the coveted adminis
tration, and "to correct her probable
misunderstanding of the property of
the estate," filed a will for probate and
asked that letters of administration be
granted to the husband. The point
that may or may not appeal to thÂ« !
sister as a joke is in the fact that the
will bequeaths her only one dollar
and leaves a like sum to Mrs. Bee's
daughter, Lena Marsten, while there
follow a score or more of legatees to
whom sums ranging from $100 to
$3000 are left.
But behind the will there Is more of
a story. Hoover's petition recites that
his wife was 45 years old; that he is
38; that her estate consists of personal
property valued at less than $10,000,
and he does not mention the owner
ship of the O'Farrell-Stockton corner.
In the directory the only Hoover bear
ing the husband's given name is set
down as a paper carrier, and his resi
dence there given corresponds to the
number of the property owned by
Mrs. Hoover, adjoining the Phelan
property on Valencia street.
Inquiry developed that Hoover mar
ried his wife a few days before her
will was made on October 5 last, and
that before her death she had deeded
all of her property to Attorney Matt
Sullivan, and he had reconveyed it to
Mrs. Hoover and her husband. Under
this Joint ownership Hoover became
the owner of the valuable corner and
the Valencia-street home upon his
wife's death. It is declared that she
had very little other property and the
bequests in her will, which exceed the
estimated value of her personal es
tate, are being paid by the fortunate
widower.
Mrs. Hoover may have been older
than the stated 45 years. She was
married to men named Poole, New
lands and lastly Hoover. She was the
mother of Harry T. Poole, the young
National Guardsman who was shot by
the mother of Truly Shattuck, actress,
and in her will Mrs. Hoover leaves
$1000 to Dr. John Gallwey for his
care of the young man before his
death.
Her other bequests Include fourteen
under $1000 each, among which are
three Catholic charities, and those
over $1000 are as follows: Louise
Hammer, $1000; John G. Koch, $1000;
Mrs. Wefelsburg, $1000; Mrs. Leon
tine Price, $1000; Joseph H. Scott,
$3000; Alfred Zollner, $2000; Nora
Sullivan, $2000; Dr. John Gallwey,
$1000; C. L. Rogers, $1000; Mrs. John
Nicholas, $1000; Mary Polito, $1000;
Mrs. F. W. Goetz, $2000; David Scho
field, $1000. The residue goes to Hoo
ver, who is named as executor, with
Joseph H. Scott and Alfred Zollner.

AUDITOR TRICKED OUT OF
A WARRANT BY TELEPHONE
E. Hachett and J. Barry, Arrested
Wednesday Night, Are Snspected
but Not Positively Identified.
Edward Hachett and James Barry,
who were arrested on Wednesday
night for attempting to extort 1 10
from James Hurley, saloon-keeper,
116 Eddy street, by means of a tele
phone message, are suspected by the
police of having played a similar trick
upon Ajaditor Harry Baehr last Tues
day. Baehr was called up by tele
phone and a voice said, "This is Tay
lor, head gardener at Golden Gate
Park. Are the park demands ready?"
Baehr replied In the affirmative and
the voice said, "Well, I'll send a young
man for my warrant."
A young man called later and repre
senting that he came from Taylor, got
the warrant. The name of Charles
Taylor was forged on the warrant
and It was cashed at the Treasurer's
office. The amount was $7 9. The
forgery was dlsoovered when Taylor
applied on Thursday to the Auditor
for his warrant.
Daniel Leary and John Llford of the
Auditor's office had a look at Hachett
and although they feel satisfied he
was the man who got Taylor's war
rant they would not swear positively.
Hachett was released yesterday on
1200 casn bail on the Hurley charge
and Barry was sent to the Central
Emergency Hospital suffering from
delirium tremens.

JAP MAIDENS
MUST RETURN
Physician Finds Trachoma
Mingled With Love-Light
in Eyes of Fair Travelers
ONE A PICTURE BRIDE
Another Is the Daughter of
a Rich Brewer and Is Here
Seeking* Occidental Polish
Among the passengers who arrived
htre yesterday on the liner Coptic
were two pretty daughters of Japan,
who may not be allowed to land. One
left the island kingdom to meet the
husband whose photograph she vowed,
eight months ago, to love, honor and
obey. The other, the daughter of a
wealthy Yokohama brewer, came here
to join her intimate and high-born
friend at a private school in this city.
When the keen-eyed but hard-hearted
immigration surgeon examined the
lath-fringed lids that covered the al
mond eyes of the Japanese girls he
found traces of trachoma, a disease
very prevalent in Japan, and one
which Uncle Sam's surgeons are do
ing their best to keep out of this
country. The surgeon's discovery will
probably lead to the girls being sent
back to Japan.
Thus in the case of Sei Yam ague hi
is cruelly shattered a dream of re
union in a far land with a girlhood
chum. Sei is the daughter of one of
Japan's wealthiest brewers. A year or
so ago her friend came to this
city to have her education fin
ished and polished in the most
approved Occidental fashion. Many
letters passed between the girla
and finally Sei's parents consented to
their daughter's taking a dip in the
sea of higher education. On the
shores of the ocean of learning, how
ever, a man of science meets the
pretty little schoolgirl. He looks into
her eyes as many a youth of far Nip
pon has yearned to look, but with a
different purpose. The Japanese lover
might look and find the love-light
dancing. The Federal doctor lpoked
and found â trachoma. Unless he erred
in his diagnosis Miss Sei Yamaguchi
m,ust finish her education in Japan.
Tasaburo Asai, the other victim of
the dread disease, is also exceedingly
fair of face and form. Eight months
ago she was married to the photo
graph of a Japanese honest boy estab
lished in this city. When she, In Yo
kohama, in the presence of her rela
tives and the relatives of the photo
graph's original, was making her mar
riage vows to the flower-draped pic
ture of her far-away fiance, the long
distance groom was with his friends
in this city swearing fidelity to a
counterfeit presentment of Tasaburo's
fair features. The husband's marriage
certificate was sent to Japan and with
that in her possession Tasaburo start
ed on the Coptic to join her spouse.
She, too, will have to return to Japan
and there- wait in patience until her
Japanese honest boy has made his
pile.
Two other Japanese girla. passen
gers on the Coptic and victims of tra
choma, were held up yesterday by the
immigration people.
MISS SHAW
FINDS MANY
GOOD OSWALDS
Miss Mary Shaw, whose Mrs. Alving
in "Ghosts' is of the famous figures of
the contemporary stage, told me that it
was impossible to find a really bad Os
wald. Miss Shaw should know.
She had six of them during her ex
perience In the play, Including Mr.
Harry Mestayer, the Oswald of the
week at the Alcazar. Miss Shaw's
theory, of course, is that the impulse of
the role is so tremendous that it must
carry any actor to a certain distlnctloa.
To me it does not carry Mr. Mes
tayer so very far. The actor was, how
ever, at considerable disadvantage last
Thursday, with the curiously miscon
strued Mrs. Alving of Miss Lillian
Lawrence to play up to, and the gen
eral uncertainty of an odd matinee
performance. But the play is essen
tially pathological and must so be con
sidered. The truth or untruth of the
depicting of Oswald'B physical wreck
age is of its most important considera
tions. Here Mr. Mestayer fails to con
vince, even by the physiological data
furnished by the lines. Oswald has
come home tired out, is sleeping, in
fact, as the play opens, in the middle
of the day, yet Mr. Meatayer moves,
gestures, even shouts, through scene
after scene with a quite melodramatic â¢
energy. Oswald's shrinking fear of
noise is Insisted uponâ Mr. Mestayer
uses all of a very healthy pair of lungs
in line after line. One of the essential
symptoms of his malady is the inca
pacity to feel emotion, yet the actor
evinces strenuous feeling In situation
after situation. Even Mr. Mestayer's
earlier make-up did not conduce to il
lusion; he looked like any other nice
boy of one's acquaintance. In the last
act, of course, the black and white con
tributed the necessary ghastllness. But
aa a portrait of a degenerate Mr. Mes
tayer's Oswald Is only spasmodically
convincing. It Is ingenious and illum
inative In spots and throughout shows
conscientious effort. But it Is keyed
rather in melodrama than in problem
key, and far from Ibsen.
Miss Lawrence, in a charming Pa
risian gown, was an eminently lady
like figure as Mrs. Alving. Miss Law
rence does not "emote" â to use Blanche
Bates' awful and effective verb â very
successfully. In the lighter moments j
of the play, such as there are, the ac
tress showed her usual cultured, easy
Intelligence, but failed entirely in sug
gesting the stress of the heavier scenes.
Mr. Shumer acted the Pastor Manders
in a wholesome, straightaway fashion
that one was quite grateful for, once
only playing for the obvious laughs for
which the role offers such tempting op
portunity. Engstrand was played by
George P. Webster with fair success,
Regina with the same by Miss Eliza
beth Taite. The play will go again at
a special matinee next Thursday. The
house of this week was crowded to
capacity.
BLANCHE PARTINOTON.
Uses a Strange Hold.
While Ah Yin*, a Chinese pawn
broker at 823% Washington street,
was standing at the corner of Wash
ington and Stockton streets yesterday
afternoon with his friend, Tee Sun,
John J. Smith, a hanger-on in China
town, approached Ying and threw an
arm around his neck. With his other
hand Smith slapped Ying'a pocket to
see if any coin was in it. Ying broke
away from him and ran till he met
Policeman Rudden. Meantime Smith
had thrown his arm around Yee Sun's
neck and a crowd had gathered. Smith
was arrested by Rudden and locked
up on a charge of battery.
MONEY LENDERS
MAKE A PROFIT
Stockholder Wants Account
ing of Ten Per Cent
Loans Made Workingmen
INTEREST IS DIVERTED
Methods of Danby Company
Shown in Bad Light by a
Partner Now Dissatisfied
That particular feature of "frenaied
finance" which holds a wage earner up
for 10 per cent a month when he is
forced to assign his prospective pay to
a money lender in order to get the
wherewithal to .pay current expenses is
set forth in a complaint for accounting
filed yesterday by W. H. Liana against
the Danby Company, the Standard
Bank, John EL Morris, Jane I* Morris,
S. I. Danby and other stockholders of
the Danby Company.
Lane says he owns a five-eighths in
terest in a block of 1200 shares in the
Danby Company, and that, though the
profits on 10 per cent loans have been
great, he has received no dividends. He
says that only 4000 shares have been is
sued and of these Morris owns 2347 and
pretends to hold 1200 as trustee. How
he came by the 1200 is explained in the
allegation that, in order to control and
wreck the concern, he threatened to ex
pose the wrongdoings of S. I. Danby,
then general manager of the company,
unless he transferred the shares and.
later, by the same threats, caused Dan
by to leave the State. It Is Bald, too,
that one M. B. Mihran claims to hold
an assignment of Danny's 1200 shares,
though knowing that Lane owned an
interest in them. With practically all
the stock in his possession and the
other stockholders in his control, it la
charged, Morris acted as the board of
directors and ran things for his own
benefit.
His practice, it is said, waa to lend
money in the name of his wife or him
self to the company at 8 per cent a
month, and then lend it through the
company to wage earners at 10 per
cent, finally appropriating principal and
interest to his own use. In July of last
year, it Is alleged, he conceived a
scheme to put the company out of busi
ness by a resolution "of the directors"
that it should cease lending money and
deposit lta cash on hand with the
Standard Bank at 4 per cent per an
num. Lane alleges that the so-called
bank is ÃBing the Danby company
money as usual for the 10 per cent a
month loans and that Morris and his
wife are getting the nroflta. He says
that the amount Morris has converted
to his own use exceeds $2500 and a full
accounting of the profits and losses of
the loans fo wage earners is demanded.

match agrinst the seaside team. The
Santa Cru2 players have become en
thusiastic since their match against

overy Sunday until the close of the sea
son.
Association football has "caught on"
in Sacramento, the effort to establish
the game there having met with suc
cess. Edgar Pomeroy, the veteran foot
baller, is in Sacramento and has
worked hard to get old players of as- j
sociation football together. He has
been helped by John McGregor of the
Oakland Hornets and by . L. Wilson
Robitaille, the well-known cricketer of
itie capital city. In spite of - wet
ground and threatening sky, twenty
two players turned out for the first
practice in Oak Park, and a lively game
was played, with G. Readman. an old
association footballer, as referee. Some
of the men, though entirely out of
practice, showed good form. The roll
of members includes: H. G. Macartney

NOTED HOUND POCATELLI
RETIRED FROM COURSING
Son of Emm Pasha-Little Wonder Will
Not Be Sent to Slips Again
one of the greatest grey
hounds ever bred In California, has
been retired to the stud. The coursing
field thus leses one of its cleverest per
formers. He injured hie feet some
months since in competition and it was
found Impossible to bring him back to
his old form.
He is owned by George Nethercott of
Sacramento and is by Emm Pasha-Lit
tle Wonder. These are two of the most
famous American greyhounds, so that
Pocatelli came naturally by his speed
and by the other qualities which made
him stand out as a giant among the
running dogs of this coast. Pocatelli
was considered of such class that nego
tiations were entered Into with his
owner by a well-known fancier in an
< Wort to send him to England to com
plete for the great Waterloo Cup. As
he has not been run to such a degree
as to break him down it is expected he
will duplicate the success of his sire as
â  stud dog.
The owners of . candidates for the
Belle Brandon Cup are giving their
young greyhounds some stout trials. T.
.1 Cronin has a dozen candidates from
which to select his representatives.
James Sweeney will start the first of
the Roman Athlete puppies, of which
much is expected.
The coursing men expect some sen
sational sport with the , Oregon hares
when the weather conditions are favor
able. Last Sunday was -cold and wet
and the hares were just off the train.
With all these handicaps they proved
fliers. They will show - greater 'speed
this week, from all "appearances. \, This

The Vampires contended strenuously
that last Sunday's match with the Hor
nets was a tie, asserting the referee de
prived them of a goal through an error.
They put up the fee for a protest to
the league and the case was heard on
Thursday night. Two prominent Vam
pires, .who are also referees, stated un
equivocally that the referee's whistle
sounded before the ball entered the net.
and that the ball was, therefore, dead.
The league decided against the Vam
pires en the ground . that a referee's
decision is final, even though he should
state he was in error.

BLUE AND GOLD TEAM
MADE UP OF VETERANS
"Heine" Heitmuller, the Giant
Pitcher, Is Again the
Mainstay of Nine.
SOME OF THE CLEVER BALL TOSSERS WHO WILL SPORT THE BLUE ANP GULO OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFOR
NIA ON THE DIAMOND IN THE TNTFRCOLLEGIATE SERIES WITH THE PLAYERS FROM STANFORD UNVEKSITT,
FOR WHICH PRACTICE IS NOW IN PROGRESS.
BERKELEY, Feb. 10.â Luck Is con
ceded to be with the University of
California's baseball team this year, so
far as the matter of having a major
ity of seasoned players on its list Is
concerned. Eight of the nine players
who defeated Stanford so handily on
the diamond last year are back in col
lege again competing for places on the
varsity team. Probably seven of the
eight will get the coveted places. For
the other two there Is a strenuous
contest on between a lot of freshmen
and the veterans. The issue will not
be finally settled for several weeks,
when Coarli Williams will announce
the make-up of the varsity team.
The eight veterans who are on the
roster of the team are: Heltmuller.
Bliss, Graham, Glllis, Streub. Gunn.
Wulzer and Sweesy. The men who
dropped out of last year's team are
Captain Adams and Kenneth Hamil
ton.
The freshmen who are candidates for
places on the nine are Butler. Reed.
Cunha, Schmidt and Jordan. All of
these youngsters aspire to positions in
the outfield. None of them hopes to
displace the first-class veterans who
make up the infield and battery of the
university team.
"Heinie" Heitmuller, star of the var
sity football eleven, whose punting was
Club and Dr. E. E. Baker and G. D.
Greenwood are substitutes of the vis
iting team. The second half of the
match will be played on the course of
the Claremont Country Club next Sat
urday, the scores of the two days'
play being reckoned together. A sim
ilar thirty-six hole match, eighteen
holes on one course and eighteen on
the other, will be played later in the
season. The Presidio course, which
was rain soaked, has been dried con
siderably by the wind and bright sun
of the last few days and is in fair con
dition.
the bright particular feature of the
varsity's work against Stanford, shines
also on the baseball diamond. He is
captain of this year's team, one of its
heaviest batters and a smashing good
pitcher. Heitmuller pitched on Wed
nesday against the fast St. Mary's Col
lege team and held the Oakland men
down to four hits. In the same game
he made two or three base hits, scoring
the two runs California, made. He Is
looked upon as a tower of strength to
the varsity, and when his arm gets into
shape is expected to make the Stan
ford men resemble the traditional mon
keys of the forest.
Streub, who did well last year, will
alternate as pitcher with Heitmuller.
Bliss will serve as catcher, as he did
last season. Graham is to be on first
base and Gillis will have the second bag.
Gunn is to take Adams' place at short
stop. Streub is playing third, though
with a broken finger that will prevent
him from doing any box work for some
time. Wulzer's position is right field,
and Sweesy in center. The freshmen
candidates are alternating In the field.
All of the foregoing men are in their
second year on the team, except Bliss
and Heitmuller, who have played four
years as varsity baseball men.
Causley, who waa third base on the
varsity In 1903. is trying for short stop,
and Hunter, who was captain in 1901,
may also come back to the team,
though he has not yet done any prac
tice work. Wulzen has been playing
first base during Graham's recent ill
ness, but will probably be put perma
nently in right field.

AMATEUR JOCKEYS
TO PILOT PONIES
OUT AT INGLESIDE
Exciting Races Expected at
the Charily Meet on
tbe 22d Inst
The officials of the California Polo
and Pony Racing Association are de
termined to make the forthcoming
meeting at Ingleside on Washington's
birthday the banner one in the history
of the association. Their efforts in this
direction are being greatly furthered bj
the additional co-operation of an active
committee of ladies headed by Mrs. H.
T. Scott and Mrs. Francis J. Carolan,
who are indefatigable in their efforts
to further the cause of those worthy
charities, the Women's Hospital and
the Armitage Orphanage, which insti
tutions are to be the beneficiaries of
the afternoon's sport.
The programme will consist of six
events with a two-mile steeplechase as
the possible piece de resistance. This
will partake of an international char
acter, as, in addition to E. J. Coleman,
R. M. Tobin and Francis J. Carolan,
Captain de Crespigny and Sir George
Preseott, both well-known performers
between the flags in England, will don
colors. As it is the wish of the com
petitors, the fences will be built up far
in excess of the regulation height and
the contest will be one of horseman
ship as much as of speed.
The conditions of the other five
events are so well arranged it will be
hard to forestall results, especially so
as several fast ponies will face the
starter for the first time at this meet
ing. Among these are Midlove, by
Midlothian, which won several races
under California Jockey Club rules.
Leah, which was a winner at the
Northern meetings last year, will also
start. R. M. Tobin's new purchase,
Ethel G., is, it is said, a wonder over a
distance of ground. Her owner hopes
to proudly annex the handsome silver
cup donated by the lady friends of the
asociation in the mile race.
It is expected -several ponies will
compete from the south, and there is
said to be a speed marvel in training at
Red Bluff which will make Silver Dick
and Becky look to their laurels. Ru
dolph Spreckela' string of ponies is al
ready at Ingleside. where they will be
joined in a few days by the stables of
C. W. Clark and W. E. Pedley. As a
bona fide amateur organization the as
sociation Is doing much to further the
TENNIS DEVOTEES AWAIT
FAVORABLE WEATHER.
Many Tournaments Planned
FIRST OF THE CHAMPIONSHIPS
FOR WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY
If the weather does not interfere with
the plans of the tennis players there
will be many tournaments ii^ progress
soon. On Washington's Birthday there
will be one at the California Tennis
Club and another on the Alameda ten
nis courts. The latter will be the first
championship event of the year and
will bring togther the strongest players
in the bay counties. Almost every
player of any prominence at the park
will compete and the California Club
will send four or five good men.
The present champion is George
Baker, who represents the Golden Gate
Tennis Club. It is rumored Percy Mur
dock. the Alameda crack, will not enter
the tournament. In this event Baker
will in all probability retain the cham
pionship. Even with Murdock in the
competition the champion could not be.
denied a chance. He beat Murdock in
the- finals last year when he did not
look to have a chance.
Baker's most dangerous opponent
will be George Janes. The latter has
improved considerably of late and is a
good tournament player. He foil off in
his play recently at the park, but will
do better across the bay. Other player*
who will probably work well along into
the tournament are Carl Gardner. Her
bert and Melville Long. Harry Rolfe. i
Clarence Griffin. Charles Foley, Neif;
Baker and Marius Hotchkiss.
The handicap tournament which has
been dragging at the park for weeks.
owing to unfavorable weather, will be
completed down to the semi-finals to
morrow. The committee In charge is
anxious to finish the event before the
Alameda championship tournament is
commenced. Nine players have reached
tho third round and seven places are
still open. The following second round
matches will be played in the morning:
Vensano (15) vs. Gayness (scratch >,
Singleton (15) vs. Roche (15 3-6). Sobey
(3-6) vs. Marvin (15), M. Long (owe 3-6)
vs. Jewell (3-6). Lemon (3-6) vs.
Turner (15), Gabriel (scratch) vs. Mor
MORE HARMONIOUS
FEELING PREVAILS
San Francisco Yachtsmen Express Confidence
in Commodore and Condemn Disloyalty.
The annual meeting and election of
officers of && San Francisco Yacht
Club, held in this city on Wednesday
evening, brought out nearly one-half of !
the members. 111 votes being cast. The j
annual reports showed the club to be in
a sound financial condition, its lots,
clubhouse and furniture, wharf and
rowboats being valued at more than
$16.0u0. while its liabilities do not ex
ceed $3000. Annual dues and initiation
fees brought in during the year about i
$3500. the total receipts of the club
frum all sources being J4O9J 73. The
maintenance of the club, entertain
ments, new furniture and improve- '
ments. with interest on the mortgage
and a part payment of $201) on tho prin- !
cipal of th^ mortgage, consumed nearly
all the receipts, leaving the treasurer j
T\ith a balance of $1">.
The reports showed the club has 234 .
members, a net gain of sixteen during
the year and the largest number ever :
on the roll. The fleet includes six
schooners, eighteen sloops, five yaw Is ;
and twenty-two steamers and launches. !
The dub book containing the constitu
tion and by-laws, the racing rules and
other information will he ready for dls- t
t i ibution to the members in a few days.
The most interesting and important j
features of the meeting were the strong â¢
comments made by Commodore W. O.

OUTLOOK FOR BOATLYG IS PROMISING
The new league of the boating clubs j
j of San Francisco Bay, entitled the Pa- :
I cine Coast Associuton of Amateur
j Oarsmen, has been organized and the '
following have been chosen officers for j
the coming year: William F. Harris,
president; Jainc?s A. Wilson, vice :
president; W. C. Donnelly, treasurer,
and F. E. Browning, temporary secre- i
j tary. The president is' the well-knovrn
I vater polo player and stroke of the
i senior barge crew of the Dolphin Boat
ing Club; the vice president is a mem
ber of the Ariel Rowing Club and has
competed in many regattas; the treas
urer and the secretary are members of
the Alameda Boat Club. A oonstitu
1 tion and by-laws, based on those of
| the National Association of Amateur
, Oarsmen, have been adopted, such al
terations having been made as local
circumstances require.
The delegates from the rowing clubs
t.t the n< -w association are: W. C. Don

In the upper section of the top half
George Baker and Herbert Lon.;
probably cÂ«M together. This witi t
good match. In the lower section
Long is the strongest player. H!a
hardest match will probably be with
Palmer, who looks to have a larg^Â»
handicap. With M and oa
Palmer has a good chance to 1 1
semi-tinals. Long's match with Cap
tain Jewell will be no walkover. The
Presidio crack is a clever player and
the youngster will have to do his beat
to beat him.
In the upper part of the lower half
Gabriel looks to have almost a surÂ«
thing for the semi-final place. Hotcfc
kisa and Brabant will probably flght It
out for the other place.
On the 22d the California Club will
hold the first of a series of handicap
doubles tournaments for the new di
rectors' cups. Entries will close at S
p. m. on the 21st, when the handicaps
w ill be arranged and the drawings held.
On the Dark courts today the mem
bers of the Ladles' Annex will hold a
handii-ap doubles tournament for the
DWs cups. These trophies have been
competed for but once and are in thÂ«
possession of Miss Myer and M!iÂ»s Vod
den. The tournament will start at 9
o'clock. The Juveniles will start their
February tournament to-day. It will
be a handicap singles.
The California Club has decided to
award no prizes in the continuous
tournament for the first three months'
play. This is due to the weather. \vhi<'h
has prevented play to any extent In the
tournament. It would hardly be fair to
give Janes a prize for heading th<
when Gardner, who ha* Ml I
match, has not had a chance to reach
the top.
The only change in the first etaag
ing the week was caused by the defeat
of Rolfp at the hands of Gardner. Th*Â»
latter is in second place and has chal-
I^nsr^d Janes, the number one man.
They will probably meet to-morrow.
, and that his protest had been entirely
disregarded by the regatta committee
and .the directors.
\ Treat's resolution was to' the' effect
that loyalty to the officers is essential
.to the well-being of the club, and that
the officers should enforce the by-laws
rigidly against those who disregard
their reasonable regulations and at
tempt to follow a schedule of their own.
The resolution met with a cordial re
ception and was declared to be the
sense of the meeting. The only mem
ber of the regatta committee present
declared the committee had done It*
best and that its action is final. With
a view to the more satisfactory man
agement of future power-boat races It
wag decided to add three owners of
such craft to the regatta committee.
Steps are to be taken to amend the by
laws, if It is found necessary, in this
respect. Â»
The general sentiment of the club,
as shown at the meeting, is strongly in
favor of the commodore and his fellow
directors, and the spirit of opposition
seems â  much weakened. The prospects
for a successful and harmonious sea
son are better than they were a year
ago. The opposition not only failed to
elect any one of Its nominees, but also
to develop any Support for Its course
during the season of 1904.
A good piece of news was that It is
the intention of the club to challenge
for the Perpetual Challenge cup, now
held by the ; Corinthians. . If the Chal
lenger should be beaten again an ef
fort will be made to organize a syndi
cate to build a boat that may prove
speedier.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 11. 1905.
PETERSON ADDS
TO CONQUESTS
Hard Hitting- Welter Has
Frank Mayfield at His
Mercy in Four-Round Go
The fight fans who saw George Peter
son batter and buffet Frank Mayfield
at Woodward's Pavilion last night had
t-> admit that the slender blonde youth
is the king of amateur welters in this
village. Peterson's opponent showed
he is a fighter and a game boy, but his
strength and aggressiveness were
doubly discounted by the generalship
and stiff wallops of the victor.
The mill was the climax to the Hayes
Valley Club's show. Both men com
menced to mix when the bell brought
them together. Peterson showed his
superiority in the initial spasm, land
ing lefts and rights at will, while May
fitld struggled and roughed it for a
chance to punch. Peterson opened
Mayfteld's eye with a stiff left early in
the second round and the dark-haired
lad was then at a disadvantage. He
showed sudden flashes of speed and
came back with a rally at the end of
the round that brought forth the cheers
of the multitude.
The third round was faster than the
previous two and here Mayfield came
strongly. He staggered Peterson a
couple of times in the mixups, but the
more the blonde was hit the faster he
came. The windup period contained all
kinds of fierce milling. When the bell
tapped for the last time the boys were
mixing it furiously, with Maytteld
grocrc but still fighting. Peterson re
reived the unanimous verdict of the
judges.
Johnny Crowe was never more clever
than whrn he met Jack O'Brien in the
next important event. The latter did
not have a look-in till the last round,
'.vhfn he brought a haymaker over on
< 'rowe's Jaw and put the clever one to
the floor. He was up in a twinkling
and suffered but little from the effects
of the fierce wallop.
Harry Tenny stowed Jimmy Carroll
away with a right to thr jaw in the
third spasm of their mixup. Up to
that tinir Carroll was fighting cleverly
and looked to have a chance. Abe

NEW YORK, Feb. 10.â Sefton
Hero, by many dog fanciers consid
ered the most typical and greatest
collie ever shown, is dead at the ken
nels of J. P. Morgan in Highland
Falls. N. Y. The dog won many cham
pionship ribbons here and in Europe.
He was brought from England nine
years ago and was 15 years old. The
animal was valued at $4000.
Label beat George Curran in three
rounds. Curran was winning all the
way till Label came through with a
telling one in the third and had Cur
ran gone so far that the referee stopped
the bout.
Jack Murray of New York was too
clever for Eddie Carr and won easily
in four rounds. "Tanglefoot McGov
orn" got an earned verdict over Pier
pent Ordway, while Frank Wells out
boxed Frankie Smith in the curtain
raiser. Young Frank McConnell. the
"< rippled boxer, was introduced and the
spectators showered money on him.
Jack Johnson started the shower and
then kept his hand in by refereeing the
Crowe-O'Brien mixup.
CONKLIN PLAYS A STEADY, CONSISTENT GAME
AND MAINTAINS LEAD THROUGHOUT THE MATCH

Trophies to Mark Event
CONTESTANTS CAUTIOUS
CHICAGO, Feb. 10.â Charles P. Conk
lln of Chicago became amateur billiard
champion of the United States to-nigh^
by defeating W. H. Sigourney of San
Francisco, 300 to 231, in an extra match
to decide the tie result of the national
amateur billiard tournament. Conklin
gets the Brooklyn Eagle's cup. In ad
dition to the cup, which Conklhi will
have to win three times at different
tournaments to be the permanent pos
sessor, jewelry valued at $800 goes to
the winner of the present tournament.
Conklin also, won the prize for the high
est run made during the tournament.
His high mark was 78. Conklin and
Gardner are tied for the individual ay-,
erage of the tourney, each having a
score of 11 3-37. They will meet in an
exhibition game to-morrow night to de
cide who shall receive the prize that
goes with this honor.
The second prize, won by Sigourney,
is a diamond ring valued at $500. Gard
ner had the highest grand average dur
ing the contests, and will receive a
handsome jewel. Gardner also won the
third prize. Fourth and fifth prizes
went to Norris of New York and
Threshie of Boston, respectively.
The game to-night between Conklin
and Sigourney, which decided the
championship, lasted more than three
hours. Both players were so deliberate
and so careful in their playing that the
game grew tiresome at times. Conklin
took the lead at the start and kept it
through the contest. Sigourney played
good billiards in spots only and seemed
to weaken at critical moments. On sev
eral occasions luck seemed decidedly
against him when he had the balls in
position for a good run, and he failed
of several easy shots. Conklin Dlayed
the more consistent game of the two,
and kept well in the lead throughout
the contest. Following Is the score of
the game:
Conklinâ Total, 300; high run, 31; av
erage, 6 44-46.
Sigourneyâ Total, 231; high run. 40;
average, 5 6-45.

SALOON MAN
UNDER ARREST
John McNamara, Proprietor
of Turtle, Charged With
Felony Embezzlement
TROUBLE WITH DEALERS
Fails to Turn Over Keceipts
of His Place to Hilbert
Company, His Creditors
John McNamara, proprietor ol the
Turtle saloon at the corner of Geary
and Powell streets, was arrested last
evening on a warrant charging him
with felony embezzlement. The
amount involved is $1060. The war
rant was issued at the request of F.
H. Hilbert of the Hilbert Mercantile
Company and vice president of the
Turtle Cafe Company, of which Mc-
Namara is president. The arrest grrew
out of a recent disagreement between
the two men. McNamara asserts that
the case is one of persecution and that
an effort is being made to drive him
out of business. Two daya ago the
Hilbert Mercantile Company levied
an attachment on the saloon for a
debt of $964. McNamara says that
this proceeding was unnecessary, as
he had arranged to pay the bill in full
on the day the attachment was levied.
"Last July," says McNamara, "we
decided to incorporate and had the
consent of our creditors. I retained
all the stock with the exception of
four shares, one of which was gi\^en
to each of the fpur other directors. I
then delivered a portion of the stock
to the Hilbert Company as security
for what I owed them. It was under
stood that I should continue the busi
ness and I was elected president of
the corporation. Hilbert, with but
one share of stock in his own name,
was made vice president. It was un
derstood then that all new debts
were to be paid in preference to the
old ones and eighteen months was the
time allowed to settle the latter.
"On February 8 we held a meeting
of creditors in .Hubert's office and a
proposition was made to pay off the
old debts at the rate of 50 cents on
the dollar. This was agreeable to
every one with the exception of Hil
bert's concern, and then I agreed to
pay him his bill in full. Hilbert was
to have seen me next day, but instead
of this he obtained the attachment.
All the other creditors came forward
that day and signed an agreement in
accordance with my proposition.
"My arrest to-night i^ due to the
fact that I refused to turn over to
Hilbert and the other directors the
money that has been taken in during
the last few days. I own all of the
stock and I consider the place mine.
That being the case, I am entitled to
the receipts and I will not turn them
over to any one else."
McNamara was released on bonds
as soon as he had been booked at the
City Prison.

RIDER HAGGARD
IN A NEW ROLE
Appointed to Investigate
the Land Settlement Plan
of the Salvation Army
WILL VISIT AMERICA
Effort Being Made to Secure
a Novel to Support the
Anti-Vivisection Doctrine
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. Feb. 10.â Rider Haggard's
appointment by the Colonial Secretary
to Inquire Into and report upon the Sal
vatlon Army land settlements for Im
migrants has met with general ap
proval. Ordinarily almost any one but
a popular novelist would bÂ« selected for
such a mission, but for the last few
years the author of '"She" has devoted
a good deal more time to the study of
industrial and agricultural questions
than his readers cared to see him give
to any pursuit but novel-writing.
A while ago Haggard confessed his
belief that his speechmaking and edi
torial writing regarding land culture
had made him a bit of a bore. He
declared that upon joining a social
gathering one day he overheard the re
mark: "Here's Rider Haggard; for
heaven's sake, don't mention agricul
ture." The novelist is in London at
present, partly in connection with his
coming visit to the United States and
partly to make arrangement for the
publication in book form of "Ayesho,"
the sequel to "She." which is appearing
serially on this side of the water in the
Windsor Magazine and proving one of
the greatest attractions ever secured
by this periodical. Haggard's other
novel, "The Brethren," is in great de
mand at the book shops.
It is stated that the novelist's mis
sion in the United States is directly
connected with the British govern
ment's scheme for agricultural settle
ment in South Africa. The expenses of
his trip will be borne by the trustees of
the late Cecil Rhodes. Just when Hag
gard will sail has not yet been decided.
ANTI- VIVISECTION' NOVEL.
An offer of $250 has Just been made
by the "Animals' Guardian," the offi
cial organ of English antl-vivlsectlon
ists, for the best anti-vivisection novel
submitted to its editor. The competi
tion is not restricted to British authors,
so there is no reason why writers in
America should not compete, if they
think it worth while. Probably tha
smallness of the reward and the short
ness of the time set â all manuscripts
must be submitted by the first of JunÂ«
âwill keep any author of real promi
nence from actually taking part in the
contest, but it is just possible that it
may inspire one of the several writers
of renown who are anti-vlvisectionists
to undertake a romance of this kind.
Mark Twain is against vivisection.
George Bernard Shaw is of the same
mind, and so is Jerome K. Jerome, who
took a spirited part in a recent news
paper discussion on the subject. "Wil
kie Collins and James Payn both were
apti-vivisectionists, and, according to
the editor of the "Animals' Guardian,"
both essayed the task of treating the
subject in a romance, but found it dif
ficult, owing to a limited knowledge of
the subject. It is now declared that a
standard novel pointing an anti-vivi
section moral is the greatest need of
this cause.
RELIGION OF SHAKESPEARE.
Shakespeare's religion has long been
a source of much speculation, and that
interest in the question has not abated
was shown by the composition and size
of an audience which gathered at the
Royal Institution the other day to hear
Professor Churton Collins read a paper
on the subject. That they departed
â with their curiosity unsatisfied consti
tutes no reflection on Professor Collins'
reputation as a Shakespearean scholar.
He ended his lecture as he began it,
â with a query, for the simple reason that
Shakespeare's plays afford no conclu
sive proof as to his belief.
The professor pointed out that it can
not be assumed that the religious views
expressed by the dramatist's characters
co-incide with his own. It could not, he
said, be inferred from the words of
the ghost of Hamlet's father that the
bard himself believed in purgatory; nor
from what he makes Henry VIII say
that he had faith in angels. In no sin
gle line that he had written did he ex
press disbelief in Christianity or any
of its dogmas, as understood in his
time, but it could not be asserted that
he was himself orthodox.
It was certain, however, the professor
maintained, that he accepted the ethics
of Christianity and revered them. There
was always a peculiar tenderness in his
references to Christ, and his insistence
on mercy, forgiveness and repentance
were emphatic as especially shown in
the "Tempest." His plays contain
abundant proof of his own faith in a
divinely appointed moral law. But his
theology, as far as he revealed it, ap
peared to confine itself to the know
able. There was nothing in his works
which would Justify one in asserting
positively that he believed in the im
mortality of the soul or a future state.
DICKENS STILX. POPULAR.
Two most effective answers have Just
been given to the recent assertion of a
prominent English critic that the works
of Charles Dickens no longer appeal
greatly to the readers or these islands.
The first is an announcement that In
the past month over 200,000 copies of
Dickens' novels were sold in Great Bri
tain. The second comes in the form of
a new periodical. It is called "The
Dickensian," is to be published monthly
hereafter, and is entirely devoted to
Charles Dickens and his writings.
Horace Vachell. formerly of Califor
nia, whose first novel, "Brothers," has
gone into its sixth edition on this side
of the water, has just finished a new
story which deals with school life the
scene being laid at Harrow. It is
named "The Hill."
PRINGLE PROPERTY IS SOLD.â Through
the agency oÂ£ the William Cranston Company.
Mra. Pringle has scld to Julius Hetty a lot
35x137:6 feet on the north line of Ellis street
300 west of Taylor, with Improvements con
sisting of three eight-room flats. The lot has
two frontages. ThÂ« sale price was about $J^J -
000. The seller purchased this property in
June, 1903. and paid for it $25,000. The Im
provements are not new and probably would,
not be appraised for more than $7000. The
advance of $10,000 in the price in eighteen
months Is considered by the brokers as indica
tive of the upward trend of values In thÂ« 30
vara district.

HACKS CHINESE
WIFE TO DEATH
Lung 3roy Brutally Murdered
by Fiend Who Wields a
Cleaver Tpon Her Head
LIE SUE IS SUSPECTED
Circumstances Point to Sim
ple - Minded Countryman
of Victim as the Assassin
Lung Moy. wife of Lee Soon, a cook,
was brutally murdered on a porch at
the rear of her residence, 635 Jackson
street, early last evening. The mur
derer wielded a cleaver and hacked thÂ«
woman's head and arms in a horrible
manner. Not satisfied with his fiendish
work, he drew a revolver and fired a
bullet into the prostrate form. Lie
Sue, whom the police pronounce, de
mented, and who Imagines the woman
was his first wife, has been arrested by
Detective George McMahon for the
crime. McMahon says he has sufficient
evidence to convict.
Lee Soon and Lunr Moy have been
married about twelve years and hayÂ«
j two children. Some time ago Lie Sue
, took a room adjoining the apartments
of the family in the Jackson street
â¢ house and very soon afterward became
! enamored with Lung Moy. He startled
; his friends by declaring that the
1 woman was his first wife and that he
was the father of her children. TAe Sue
did little for a livelihood and he was
regarded as being simple-minded.
Hence his declarations were not heeded
and the husband paid little attention to
him.
Shortly after 7 o'clock last evening
! Ah Won, a cousin of the woman, heard
the sounds of a scuffle on the back
porch. He did not investigate imme
diately, but rushed to the back en
trance when he heard the pistol shot.
j When he reached the porch he found
j the bloody body of the woman, with a
; new cleaver close to it. Tha murderer
had made his escape. Won called in
| the detectives and circumstances im-
I mediately pointed to Lie Sue as being
the guilty person. "When the officers
searched the tetter's room a pair of
trousers stained with blood was found
and booked as evidence against him.

NEW TORK. Feb. 10 âThe feature in stocks
to-day was the aggressive advance in the iron
md steel Industrials, especially those whose
â¢roptrty holdings are in the Southern regions.
rhe effect of thjÂ« movement on. the general list
was extremely moderate and. a fair proportion
â >r tMÂ»- prominent trading stocks were heavy.
Phe imminence of a double holiday undoubt
edly had it* -usual effect in diminishing the
rolume of profewtional operations except so
sr as the closing up of outstanding contracts
tvas concerned. Contemplated absences for
â nore prolonged periods on the part of some
."ery .*peculative operators were also looked
â â  â â :; a-Â« indicating the likelihood of dullness
n the Immediate future. There were some
â umors pointing to a distressed short interest
>' K>ng standing being closed out. especially in
:hp iron and steel stocks. But the Ftrength in
:hie group was more plausibly explainable by
h* p^rFistent rumors in circulation that â¢an
ri!d-f>tanding project had been revived â  for the
on^olidation of the leading Independent com
panies of the Southern region. Tennessee Coal,
Republic Steel and Sloss-Sheffield Steel wore
.mmedlately indicated. Reports of the flota
:ion of a bonil- !Â»^iÂ« to take care of chort-tlme
'â otes 'by Kepfiblic 'Steel ' arid an assumption
that provision would be made out of the pro
â¢c\-i9 for the accrued dividends" on the pre
>rrÂ»d stock were potent factors in thai stock,
"nited- States Steel itself showed satire in
lifference to the early stages of the movement. |
?ut rose strongly at the last. The railroad ;
.is* was but scantily represented in gains for
:hp <lay and most of the prominent stocks
ivere FluggiEh throughout. The passage of the
rate control bill through the House of Repre
sentatives was held responsible in some quar
ters for the heaviness of the market. Another
motive assigned Â«ti the prospect of a weak
hank statement. The money market continued
very easy and gave no evidence of a diminu
tion of the eupply of available credits. The
buoyancy Â©f the iron and steel Industrials held
the latter market steady, but the indifference
Df the railroad list was unrelieved. The clos
ing was firm.
Bond? were irregular. Total talee (par
rslue). f5,260,000.
I'nited States bonds were all unchanged on
call.

Trade In Potatoes and Onions continued
quiet and the market was decidedly weak,
with quite an accumulation of supplies t ln re
ceivers' hands. The market Is controlled by a
few houses, however, who are indifferent about
parting with their holdings at less than the
quotations. Two carloads of Sweet Potatoes
were marketed and choice lots found ready
sale at the maximum quotation, while poor
quality dragged at irregular prices.
Changes In southern Vegetables were slight
and there was continued firmness In good

Poultry and Game.
The Poultry market was well supplied and
easy and, although quotations were no lower,
prices had a downward tendency. Large
young chickens were fairly steady, but posted
buyers experienced no difficulty in shading the
quotations for other descriptions. Twenty-nine
cases of dressed Turkeys came in and sold
slowly at weak prices. Receipts of Game
were moderate and the market was weak for
everything except Hare and Rabbits.

Butter. Cheese and Eggs.
I The slow decline in Butter continues and the
market is reported well stocked and very dull,
â¢with the northern orders generally shut off.
Cheese has shown no change for some time.
â  The Egg market Is heavily stocked and de
pressed and prices continue to shade' off. Fine
ranch are freely offered at 24c, and only the
very choicest now bring 25c. Store Eggs are
also lower. Sellers are indurarlously seeking
buyers, but the latter are shy and do not take
a case more than they need f<* the day.
Receipts were 34.700 lba Butter, 678 cases
Eggs and 6200 lbs Cheese.

Decicluou.s and Citrus Fruits.
The open market for Oranges and other
Citrus fruits waa very quiet, with stocks of
everything except Mexican Limes plentiful.
Receipts of Oranges have been light for somÂ»
time, but there is a heavy accumulation of
all grades lying around unsold. At the auc
tion sale five carloads, chiefly standard and
choice fruit, were disposed of. Fancy sold at
$1 10@l 60, choice at 85c@$l 40 and standard
at 75c@$l 05. The Apple market was still
badly congested with low-grade fruit, which
moved slowly at irregular prices. Offerings
of Ne-wtown Pippins and Spitzenbergs were
limited and thofo varieties were firmly held at
the outelde quotation. An assorted car of or
dinary fruit from Oregon, which was rejected
by the consignees, was turned over to the
auction company to dp auctioned for account
of the railroad company, and' sold at prices
ranging from GOc to 90c per box.

LIES FOR DAYS
WITH THE SLAIN
Wounded Russian Soldier
Left for Dead Is Saved
by War Correspondents
JAMES H. HARE BACKj
Photographer at the Front
for Collier's Just Misses
the Fall of Port Arthur
James H. Hare, the famous war
photographer, who, as Collier's rep
resentative with the Japanese army,
has seen probably more of the fight
ing In the Far East than any other
civilian, returned yesterday on the
liner Coptic. With the aid of his
camera Hare has done more than all
the correspondents to convey to the
outside world some adequate idea of
the great Oriental drama through the
most stirring scenes of which he
passed.
Hare was assigned to the first army
and followed its fortunes from April
3 until December 31. He had the
good fortune to be in many engage
ments and the nerve to get more than
a few pictures while under fire. His
good fortune, he says, deserted him
at the last moment. When thing?
ceased to stir in Manchuria he pro
ceeded to Port Arthur, hoping to pho
tograph the scenes attending the fall
and evacuation of that fortress. He
waited patiently. On December 31,
after a heart-to-heart talk with the
Japanese military authorities m
charge of the siege, he came to the
i nmlusion that Port Arthur's fall was
still far away. He packed up his
cameras and other paraphernalia and
started for Dalny. on his way home.
The day after he left the first nego
tiations for surrender took place and
January 2 the siege was all over.
"And when I heard it." said Hare,
"I felt more like blubbering than I
have since I doffed knee pants."
Hare, with Donahoe and Maxwell,
two other correspondents, saved the
life of a Russian soldier on the bat
tlefield of the Shakhe under rather un
usual circumstances. It was three
days after the end of the big fight.
The three men were walking over the
corpse strewn field in company with
a Japanese officer. They were exam
ining a heap of dead Russians piled
in a trench. One big Slav, his skin
shriveled tight on his shrunk features,
attracted their particular attention as
he lay in the full glare of the blazing
t sun. A bullet had plowed a deep fur
row across the top of his head and the
blood-stained face presented a pecu
liarly ghastly appearance.
Fascinated by the horror of it, the
three men stared at the soldier's face.
Suddenly an eyelid seemed to move.
"He's alive," said one of the news
paper men.
"Nonsense," said the Japanese df
ficer. "He has been lying in that heap
and under that sun for three days. If
be had been a well man when he lay
down the sun would have killed him.
And look at that wound on his head."
"But I saw his eye move," persist
ed Donohoe of the London Daily
Chronicle. "Dead men do not bat
their eyelids. Let's take another look
at him."
Two Chinese servants were ordered
to pull the body away from the pile
of slain. As they raised the burden
the Russian's eyes opened and closed
and with a shriek of fear the Chinese
dropped their load and ran. . Other
Chinese were impressed, the Russiin
taken to the hospital and in two days
his three saviors visited him and
found him sitting up in bed drinking
tea and smoking cigarettes. He sub
sequently recovered.
Hare expects to return to the Ori
ent in a few months. He is now on
his way to New York to visit his fam
ily. ' _ _

t'XIOX MEN SAY BAKERS
HAVE HIKED "GUM FIGHTERS"
Affidavits in Boycott Cases Filed by
Members of Labor Organizations
Deny Charges. *
A bunch of affidavits was filed in
the Superior Court yesterday by va
rious members of the bakery workers'
unions in relation to the suits brought
by Swain's and Thorp & Co. for in
junctions to restitfiin picketing, boy
cotting and the intimidation of non
union workmen and customers. The
affidavits are all of the same tenor.
They admit the presence of pickets.
but say that they were only placed in
front of the places of business to "di
vert trade to persons employing union
labor." This diversion is said to be
dene in a "gentlemanly and peaceable
niKnner" and denials are entered to
Hie charges of threats, vile language
and intimidation.
It is declared, too, that the plain
i fis "have employed certain thugs and
desperate characters known as 'gun
rijrhters.' who have exhibited knives
and pistols in the presence of mem
bers of the unions, with threats of
bodily harm." The cases are before
Judge Murasky.

DUNNE CRITICIZES JURY
FOR WEAK VERDICT.
Â« .
Judge Hants That Sheriff's
Men May Have Used Suasion
AM INTIMATION OF PERJURY.
I WANT to ask you, Mr. Byington, if it is
your purpose to take any steps toward an in
quiry relative to ;; the conduct: of the Sheriff's â 
, office in connection with this case? I might sug- V,
gest in that connection that it would be advisable v
to make. ! some inquiry. , I\ am satisfied there has -
been a great deal of \% perjury in \ this case, and it
should be looked into: i: I may say also, in that
behalf, that, while lit.* is no part of my duty
. to â  lecture juries because of any verdict they
may render, I think the verdict in this case is
almost a miscarriage of justice; and it is just such
verdicts as- this that : make the name of this city
for law and order a byword for shame and dis
grzce\â--Judge Dunne's Address to District J
dMorÂ£>y'*jÃf/ing"ori/l - - \ .\
Superior .fudge Frank Dunne caused
a surprise, to put it mildly, yesterday
afternoon a'ftef^the jury in the case of
Kseorge * urry, charged with the murder
of his wife, Daisy Cyrry, handed in a
verdict of manslaughter. Judge Dunne
seemed astonished when the foreman
read the findings, and for a moment
hesitated as if pondering on the strange
trend of human opinion that in this
particular case appears to have been
decidedly opposite to his judicial views.
His Honor whirled about "in his chair,
and, addressing District Attorney By
ington, gave vent to the expressions
that are quoted above. Mr. Byington
was startled and puzzled, but in a few
moments recovered sufficiently to re
ply in a way that showed that, while
he hardly expected so sensational a
statement from the bench, he was nev
ertheless strongly inclined to support
the Judge in his criticisms.
The trial of Curry began shortly af
ter his arrest for the murder of his
wife. When he was held at the County
Jail tending a decision three of the jail
ersâFinnegan, 'Feehan and Sullivan
gave testimony that the prisoner was
subject to fainting spells, and this gave
rise to a defense of insanity. A great
deal of testimony was taken which
tended to show that on July 5, 1904,
Curry shot and killed his wife at 35
Turk street, after a quarrel. The pair
were married in Oakland six months
pior to the crime. It was said that
they had lived together before the mar
riage ceremony was performed. Curry
said his wife deserted him for a man
named "Fred," and that on the day of
the shooting he had discovered evidence
of her unfaithfulness.
BARTENDER HAS A NARROW
ESCAPE FROM BEING SHOT
Oliver Sands'. Manufacturing Chemist,
Fires Tfcice at Max Dunow In
the Press Saloon.
Max Dunow, bartender at the Press
saloon, 15 Third street, was shot at
twice yesterday morning by Oliver
Sands, a manufacturing chemist living
at the Graystone Hotel pn Geary
street. Both bullets narrowly missed
Dunow. Sands was arrested and
booked at the City Prison on a charge
of assault to murder.
Dunow told the police that Sands
had been in the saloon twice before
during the morning and as he had
been drinking Dunow refused to give
him any more liquor. This angered
Sands and he left the saloon mutter
ing to himself. When he returned
about 8 o'clock he pulled a revolver
out of his overcoat pocket and de
liberately fired at Dunow. The first
bullet grazed Dunow's head and
struck the mirror behind. Sands
fired again, but his aim was unsteady
and the bullet struck a glass on the
bar. Sands was arrested at Third and
Market streets.

IGNORE SUBPENAS IN
SERGEANT ELMS' CASE
Chinese "Statesmen" Defy Authority
of Police Commission and Trial
Is Again Postponed.
The Police Commission resumed the j
trial of Sergeant Ellis last night, but j
the six "statesmen" of Chinatown who j
failed to respond to subpenas at the i
previous session again failed to appear
and postponement was taken to Mon- [
day evening that they might be haled !
up. The Chinamen were represented i
before the board by Attorney George j
D. Collins and he announced that he |
had advised his clients to ignore the ;
subpenas on the ground that the com- j
mission does not have legal author- i
ity to compel the attendance of wit- |
nesses. The Commissioners will seek \
l^gal advice on this first defiance of !
their powers.
J. J. Scott and L. G. Carpenter testi- '<
fled that gambling was carried on in j
the Chinese quarter during the period
Ellis was in command on the squad
there. Foreman Andrews and E. J. i
Bowes of the Grand Jury were called !
to testify as to the confession of Ser- j
geant Elli? that he accepted bribe j
money, but they refused to reveal the
(secrets of the Grand Jury room. The j
commission had the report of the in
quisitorial body read and in the argu
ment on its admissibility clearly Indi
cated that it is their purpose to dismiss

Perkins Gets Into Trouble.

ran out of the store and was pursued
by one of the salesmen. A Chinese
got in his. way and Perkins struck him
on the mouth, knocking him down.
At Kearny street Perkins ran into Ser
geant Williams, who seized him. Per
kins struck the sergeant, but was soon
overpowered and taken to the City
Prison. Two charges of battery and
one of petty larceny were booked
against him. The stolen coin was
found in his pockets.

SCHOOL INCOME
IS ENDANGERED
Supervisors to Confer With
Merchants' Association on
Proposed Apportionment
WILL OPPOSE MEASURE
Meeting Is Arranged for To-
Day to Present City's Case
to the State Legislature
The Supervisor's Finance Commit
aee held a special meeting yesterday
on the bill which is now before the
Legislature, and which has gone to
second reading, amending the Stata
apportionment for the support of pub
lic schools. This will result in a loss
of about $250,000 in the school reve
nue of San Francisco. It \/as shown
that this city contributes one-third of
the taxes for the conduct of the
schools of the State and yet receives
only one-fourth in return for its own
schools.
The apportionment is to be made
in the interest of the poorer school
districts. The rural legislators are
unanimously in favor of the bill, and
Governor Pardee, it was Baid, will sign
It if it passes, as it undoubtedly will,
unless this city makes proper effort to
protect its interests.
One plan suggested yesterday, but
not adopted, was for the Board of Su
pervisors to establish eighty school
districts in this city. This would only
result in an increase of $25,000 in the
school funds, leaving still a shortage
of $225,000.
The committee deemed it advisable
to interest the Merchants' Associa
tion and other civic organizations for
the purpose of presenting data to the
Legislature in opposition to the meas
ure. It was arranged by telephone for
a committee from the Merchants' As
sociation to meet the Finance Commit
tee this afternoon at the City Hall at
2 o'clock, when a plan of campaign
will be definitely agreed upon.
Other bills affecting the municipal
â  affairs of San Francisco will also be
'discussed, including the one to double
the force in the Fire Department,
which, the Finance Committee says,
j will cost the city $500,000 yearly.

THIEVES ROB
HOHN'S STORE
Break Into Grocery and Then
Start to Load Wagon,
but Are Frightened Away
Three men, supported by a fourth in
a light wagon, broke into and robbed
the grocery store of W. & H. Hohn at
Hyde and Turk streets yesterday morn
ing at 3 o'clock and before being fright
ened away took $20 from the cash reg
ister. That they did not get more was
owing to the restlessness of R. E.
Goodmanson, living at 405 Turk street,
opposite the store, who spied the
burglars and blew a police whistle,
which, however, brought no response.
Goodmanson, who is suffering from
rheumatism and sleeps lightly, arose
about 3 o'clock to get a drink. The
faucet is near the window and glancing
out he saw three men acting suspi
ciously in front of the Hohn grocery.
While he was watching, a wagon,
drawn by a dark horse, was driven
down Hyde street and turned Into
Turk, passing the store. As the wagon
rattled by the men on the sidewalk
smashed a large pane erf glass in the
front door. The sound of falling glass
was drowned by the noise of the wagon.
Awaiting developments Goodmanson
continued to watch the three. One man
dressed in a long overcoat and soft hat
and carrying a white bundle under his
arm stood on the street corner to act
as "lookout." The other two, who ap
peared to be young men, moved toward
the duor.
The wagon, which had evidently been
driven around the block, now reap
peared and stopped before the grocery.
One of the young men entered the shop
and Goodmanson ran for his police
whistle. As he returned the man inside
handed sc-mething to the one outside,
who in turn handed It to the lookout.
At that moment Goodmanson blew a
long blast on the whistle; the man in
the wagon whipped up, and the three
men on foot mc-ved rapidly up Hyde
street and disappeared.
After blowing for several minutes
and getting no response Goodmanson
returned to bed. and the grocery with
the shattered door lay exposed to fur
ther depredation until the clerks ar
rived in the morning. The police re
ceived a report of the affair yesterday
morning and are investigating.
Hart's Contempt Submitted.
Arguments were heard before
Judge Troutt yesterday upon the cita
tion for General \V. H. H. Hart to
show cause why he should not be pun
ished for contempt for refusing to tes
tify before a referee a3 to his prop
erty interests in the matter of the ef
fort of the Nevada Mining and Mill
ing Company to recover from him on
a judgment for 55733. Haxt resists
the order on the ground that he is a
resident of Santa Clara County; that
the Nevada company is a foreign cor
poration, which has not complied with
the laws of this State, and that the or
der for examination was pending be
fore Judge Troutt, not before the ref
eree. The plaintiff desires particu
larly to inquire into a mortgage for
$12,000 given by Hart to his wife, os
tensibly foi borrowed money, upon
property in the southern part of the
' State. If it can be proved that the
> incumbrance is an evasion the coin
1 pany may be able to recover. The
case will be submitted on briefs.

Hubbard Fails to Appear.
Elbert Hubbard. lecturer and writer.
was to have spoken at the T. M. C. A.
Auditorium last evening, but he failed
to be there. The agent of the lec
turer had accepted the T. M. C. A.
terms for an address and the housp
was sold out to the last row. All th"
explanation Secretary McCoy could
offer was that "he agreed to come, bur.
he didn't. I suppose he is still In Los
Angeles, where we last communicated
with him."
