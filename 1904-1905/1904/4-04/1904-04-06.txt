The^defendant is accused of shoot
ing Van Zandwick. who was a porter
in Freeman's saloon in Harvey. â¢
Repeated protests were made by the
defendant's counsel, but the court per
mitted the Assistant State's Attorney
to proceed. When as a climax. Bar
bour carried the minds of the jurors
to Oakwood Cemetery the "witness"
was again returned to his grave and
the jury /was asked to sentence Free
man to death. Â£"Â£.?â¢Â£Â» '
Freeman turned pale and, gazed
helplessly at his lawyers. The widow
and two children af Van Zandwick
broke into^ears as the attorney put
question after question to the vacant
chair. Not a sound could be heard
in the courtroom as Barbour pictured
the witness sitting there, bleeding and
wounded. In a graphic -manner the
attorney demonstrated to the jury just
how he believed Van Zandwick would
act and what evidence he would give
were he really on the witness stand.
Pointing in a dramatic manner to the
empty witness chair the Assistant
State's Attorney told the jury t\iat he
had summoned -Van Zandwick from
his grave to confront the man on trial
for murder. With awe-stricken faces
the jurors leaned forward and gazed
at the chair, apparently as interested
as if the dead had come to life, and
sat before them as a witness.

CHICAGO, April 5. â That an auda

"The idea occurred to me. when I
was in New York," said Niedemeier.
"I stood outside the church and
thought how easy it would be to do a
piece of business with Rockefeller that
would bring us millions of dollars in
stead of the paitry hundreds that we
were making by saloon 'stick-ups.'
Of course, it would have taken time,
but then a man can afford to wait a

have to get money, too.

Officers are scouring the city in hopes
of capturing Professor Sherwood's as

Near the corner of Fulton street and
Durant avenue two men approached
him, walking some feet apart. He
passed between them, and as he did so
one of them struck him from behind
with a sandbag, and the other, drawing
a revolver, told him not to yell.
Professor Sherwood, half stunned,
staggered away from the men. : At that
moment Assemblyman W. H. Waste
and his .wife and D. W. Albee came
along.'
At sight of them the thugs ran, dis
appearing in the darkness. Sherwood
fell to the walkl Before he lost con
sciousness he gave brief details of the
attack.
The injured man was carried to Mr.
Albeejs home and Dr. Stella Lehr was
called. She found a cut in the scalp
and took six stitches in it-
Professor Sherwood, was returning
from the Postofflce, to which he had
gone to mail some letters.
â¢ Professor William Sherwood of the
chemistry department of the Univer
sity of California was the victim of a
mysterious and brutal assault at mid
night last night. He is now lying at
the home of D. W. Albee in an uncon
scious condition and it is feared his
skull is fractured.
The professor's assailants made no
demand for his valuables before at
tacking him and were frightened away
by the approach of other people Im
mediately after the assault. While
their motive was probably robbery, it
was not shown by any words they ut
tered nor by any act after the attack.

2148 Center Street. April 6.
Anticipating they know not just
what, the local Santa Fe officials this
evening enlisted the services of Charles
Elton, who yesterday resigned the office
of Chief of Police. He admitted that
he had been engaged, but would not
discuss the matter further than to say
that he was fully prepared for any
emergency. He has twenty picked men
at his command and has instructed
them to report to him to-morrow morn
ing. He says they are to be used only
in an emergency.
At San Bernardino to-night a request
was made upon the authorities for the
appointment of. 100 additional deputies.
The shops of the company are there,
and that point will be the center of ope
rations In the event of trouble.
General Manager Wells of the Santa
Fe lines in Southern California denied
to-night that any trouble was expect
ed. He stated that the company's po
sition with reference to the demands
of the men is known and there would
be no deviation from it. He intimated
that preparations have been made to
meet any possible contingency. '
If the strike is declared it will affect
mainly the machinists and with them
the roundhouse employes and helpers,
but the employes of the operating de
partment w III not take part in the
trouble.
"I'll tell you' this,"/ said a machinist
at the Santa Fe roundhouse to-night,
"if, there is a strike there will be no
violence. ,. If we strike we will go s
far as anybody, to protect the com
pany's property. It all depends upon
what our officers in the Kast decide.
We have submitted our case and the
decision will- soon be known."
The report, that the men .would be
ordered to walk out at the hour men
tioned was received from Chicago and
by the men themselves. It was trans
mitted secretly, and it-is their admitted
expectation that matters iwill reach a
climax to-morrow. They, decline to
state what their plans are, but there

LOS ANGELES, April 5.â If the ex
pected happens the strike which has
been threatened on the entire Santa Fe
Railroad system will bggin to-morrow
morning at S o'clock. 'There have been
so many alarms of this character since
the trouble between the machinists and
railroad officials began that some of the
latter are disposed to doubt the' reports
which have been received by the : men
to-night and to assert that there 'will
be no, strike. Others. equally conserv
ative are taking the .other view of it
and through their efforts the railroad
company to-night made preparations
to meet almost any emergency.

The military academy appropriation
bill was then passed without amend
ment.
Branching off on the tariff, he
called ux>on De Armond to state what
ought to be changed in the tariff.
"There would be no ten of you,"
he said, "that will name the same
item: no five of you that will come
within 50 per cent of it, and none of
you will agree on all of the items of
the tariff," at which there was much
laughter.
lie scored the Democratic party on
the tariff question, as being composed
of a "disorganized, broken up, dis
membered, helter skelter crowd."
Democratic applause followed an
inquiry from De Armond as to
Â¦whether the gentleman would en
deavor to "provide one if the statute
of limitations is found to be insuf
ficient."
Grosvenor, facing the Democratic
Bide, said:
"Tour entire clamor and your libel
ous attacks have been based upon
nothing but a deliberate purpose to
tarnish the administration of your
Government in the interest of party
politics."
"And." he said, referring to the St.
Ivouis boodle case, "so far as we
know there is no ready-made, â¢willing
Supreme Court to set at liberty every
body who should h* convicted."
Giosvenor said this had been shown
by the convictions in Â¦Washington,
Baltimore, New York and elsewhere.
He sarcastically remarked that
Â¦when a member of the House knew
enough to hurl in the face of the
rhajorlty of the House the charge
that they were covering up and pro
tecting crime, "he ought to know
enough to make some statement that
somebody, somewhere, had commit
ted some crime." He declared, amid
laughter, that since the reference to
the postoffice report in the House the
Democrats had gone through a series
of "agonirings.*"
"Why are you opposed to investi
(Tdtjon?" inquired De Armond.
"For the manifest reason," said
Grosvenor. "that the department has
been thoroughly investigated. All
Â¦wrong has been laid bare."
What crime.** Grosvenor asked,
"has been committed in any one of
The branches of the administration of
the Federal Government and by
vliom ?"
Grosvenor closed general debate on
the military academy appropriation
bill, devoting: himself to a defense of
the Republican party. De Armond.
he Eaid. had indicted the leaders of
the House for an attempt to cover up
crime.
Referring: to the President, he
spoke of the situation at the White
House as "executive chaos." and in
quired -what the President had done
to commend himself to the people.
WASHINGTON. April 5. â The pro
ceedings In the House to-day -were
enlivened fcy speeches by De Armond
and Grosvenor. the former attacking:
the Republicans for failure to order
an Investigation Into the postofflce
charges tad to revise the tariff, and
the latter vigorously defending: the
Republican party and lauding Presi
dent Roosevelt for the part he played
In the postal investigation, the pass
*jre of the Cuban reciprocity law and
the treaty -with Pans^na for the con
struction of an isthmian canal.
Speaking to the Republican mem
bers of the House, De Armond said:

"Th<s Fawan left Chefu last week and
at that time it was not known there
that the Russians had proclaimed
martial law at Newchwang, which was
supposed to be a neutral port that was
free to air comers. Mr, Washburn and
myself were greatly astonished, there

Newchwang harbor, the Fawan was
seized by the Russian officials, who
came out to us in a steam launch.
The muster of our crew revealed the
presence of two Japanese, "which
caused great excitement among our

declined and soldiers with fixed . bayo

destroy it if any atempt should be
made to leave the harbor. During the

BELGRADE, April 5. â The committee
which had been enrolling volunteers
in Servia for service in Russian arm
ies in the war in the Far East have
been dismayed at the receipt of a tele
gram from the Emperor of Russia
thanking the members of the commit
tee and the volunteers for their sym
pathy, but declaring that the services
of the Servians would not be required.
. The Emperor's telegram came as a
complete surprise. One thousand ap
plications from volunteers already had
been received and the medical exam
ination of the candidates had been set
for next week. The news created
something of a sensation at the festi
val for the benefit of the Russian Red
Cross Society, at which King Peter
and many persons distinguished in so
cial life were present, but it did not
interfere with the financial , result of
the festival, tp_ which the King con
tributed $1000. p

said that .he would accept the volun

Twelfth divisions, which had been
concentrated at Anju, is moving on
Wiju by three routes.' It was the ad
vance guard, composed of 450 infan

five miles southeast of Wiju, on March
28. Lieutenant Kato and four Japan
ese were k'lled on that occasion and
Captain Kurowaka and eleven men
seriously wounded. The Russians had
ten men killed.

ST. PETERSBURG, April 5.â A
correspondent at Port Arthur, , who re
turned to the fortress yesterday from
an inspection ' trip through Southern
Manchuria, telegraphs that, the coun
try is strikingly full of an unusualand
active. life; that the troops are vigor
ous and healthy and animated by a de
sire for active operations, and that the
entire native population, including
that of the commercial world, is
friendly to Russia and full of faith in
the Russian arms. The correspon
dent says:
"Russian money, which was shaky
at the beginning of the war, is again
firm. The Chinese volunteer militia
formed here presents a good appear
ance, wearing a special uniform with
epaulettes bearing the Russian na
tional flag.' The natives provide pro
visions freely and are selling horses
brought from the surrounding coun
try. The Mandarins are an exception
to this general rule, as they are cau
tious and are trying to carry water
on both shoulders. As their conduct
is passive it does the Russians no
harm.

enemy's ships for a long time in the
darkness, was himself wounded, and
his chief engineer and six men were
killed.
"With his machinery disabled and
the helm of the Silni damaged, the
Lieutenant decided to cease firing;
but, fearing to leave the open entrance
to the harbor, he approached the
shallows near Golden Hill and got
off In a boat with another officer to
extinguish the flre on. the nearest
steamer and to render aid to the
twelve Japanese who had been
wounded. . â¢!; ]
,. "The Otvajny sent surgeons to care
for the wounded, and boats were sent
to the other steamers at a terrible
risk, to cut the wires connecting the
torpedoes, which the Japanese had
arranged to destroy the steamers.
The fires on the ships were ex
tinguished."
"Other Japanese steamers came on
at full speed, raining Hotchkiss bul
lets at the Silni, which fired a second
torpedo at the steamers . and then
ran aground.
"The commander of. the Silni dis
covered five of the- -enemy's destroy
ers farther away, and the big ships
valiantly rushed to attack,' firing their
guns as they did so. The- enemy then
separated and* disappeared in ; . the
darkness.
"Following a reconnoissance our
fleet returned and anchored in the
interior of the harbor. After mid
night the darkness became more pro
found and our searchlights were con
stantly in operation, . piercing the
gloom. Suddenly a shot thundered,
and then a second and then a third.
Golden Hill and Tiger Cliff opened
flre when the enemy was discovered.
From the battleship Petropavlovsk
a launch put on! with Vice Admiral
Makaroff and other officers heading
for the sunboat Bobr. At the same
time the torpedo-boats Silni and
Reshitelny signaled to prepare for
action and to attack the enemy. The
Kunboat Otvajny discharged her six
inch guns and the torpedo-boat Silni
fired a broadside while hurrying to
ward the enemy and let go a torpedo
which fairly struck the prow of the
first Japanese steamer, carrying it
away.
ST. PETERSBURG, April 5. â A

BRUSSELS, April 5.â A telegram from
the Berlin correspondent of the Solr,
which is reproduced for what it is
worth, says that King Edward . has
taken the preliminary steps to ascer

ably disposed to accept an offer of me
diation.
The Czar, it is alleged,: replied that
such an offer on the part- of the Kirig
of England would certainly be accept

eecured, the correspondent says, it
would be difficult for Japan to decline
a proposal emanating from her power
ful ally.
Special Dispatch to THÂ« Call.
The army organ's correspondent at
Liaoyang forwards a description of
General Kuropatkin's headquarters, as
follows:
"There is none of the pomp and cir
cumstance in life hereâ nothing but a
round of hard work. The stone cot
tages builf for the staff are "'cold and
cheerless. Inside the officers have to sit
in furs, despite the roaring fires, but
they are too busy to notice the discom

Great preparations are being made
at St. Petersburg for the reception of
the crews of the Varaig and Korietz.
The Council has voted $7500 for their
entertainment. Scholarships will ' be
found for the children of the officers.
Lieutenant Colonel Froloff, who has
been acting 5 chief of the general staff
since General. Sakharoff's appointment
as War Minister, has been granted the
rights and privileges of an Assistant
Secretary of State by the Emperor.
This may foreshadow his permanent
appointment.
General Sakharoff announces that the
Orenburg Cossacks will be allowed $25
each for the purchase of horses. This
measure indicates the mobilization of
the Cossacks in the Orenburg prov
ince in case of necessity.
RECEPTION' TO CREWS,
"Captain StepanofT has done well to
explain the truth. It has never been
to Russia's interest to make enemies,
although foolish chauvinism often has
done so. Russia has every reason to
express her sincere thanks and recog
nition for the humane and noble bear
ing of every power represented at Che
mulpo." ' , "
Captain Stepanoff, in the statement
referred to, said:
"At the time the VicksOurg was sta
tioned at Chemulpo her captain held
aloof; he took no part irT the confer
ences of protest preceding the fight, for
the simple reason that he was not In
vited to do so. After the fight, like the
others, he sent a surgeon with a boat
to the rescue. As regards his not tak
ing Russian^ seamen aboard the Vicks
burg, this, was unnecessary, and it is
more than probable that Captain Rudi
neff. commanding the Varaig. did not
ask it."
The statement by. Captain Stepanoff,
an officer formerly attached to the Va
riag, at Odessa on April 2 regarding
the action of the commander of the
United States gunboat Vicksburg at
Chemulpo was reprinted here to-day.
It is believed the statement will put
an end to the discussion of the inci
dent, which has been the cause of so
much irritation in Russia. The Zei
tung says:

WHAT TEA DOES TO
RHEUMATICS.
"When you next take tea, think of th!*
Tea contains 175 grains of Uric Acid
,ln every pound.
Meat contains only five to sevea
grains.
j Rheumatism is Uric Acid In the blood.
j Uric Add accumulates from food when
I the digestive apparatus cannot create
enough Alkaline elements (like soda) to
neutralize it. '
This Acid collects urea, or worn-out
waste matter, from the system.
That Urea enters the blood when Alka-
line action has not previously dis-
solved it.
By and by the waste matter reached
the joints and muscles, through circula-
tion of the blood. ' .
; There it gradually deposits in bo114
particles, like granulated sugar.
These solid particles grind between
I the Joints and muscles at every move-
ment.
i This grinding causes irritation and
1 pain.
These in turn may develop inflammv
i tion and swelling. That inflammation
:bestirs Nature to help herself.
She proceeds to coat the hard Uric par-
ticles over with cushions of pulpy mu-
cous, like the first healing strata of an
Â©uter sore.
This pulpy covering grows to thÂ»
bones, as well as to the particles deposit-
ed. There it hardens like plaster or
sealing wax. Then we . have "bony
Joints." almost inflexible, and usually
fixed in a bended position, from the pain
and inflammation.
That is Rheumatism at its worst.
It is bad enough before it gets that
far.
There is but one sure way of curing
Rheumatism. The first step is to neutral-
ize the Uric Acid already in the system.
Next, to dissolve, and carry away, tht
hard deposits that grind between thÂ«*
Joints. Then get the digestive apparatus
into such hpalthy condition that it will,
unaided, produce less Uric Acid, and
more Alkalines.
This is v.-hat Doctors generally havÂ«
failed to do. â¢
It is what* I studied a lifetime to ac-
complish, and achieved only after many
failures and thousands of experiments*.
At last I found, in Germany, a Solvent
which wos not only effective, but abso-
lutely safe to use.
Few agents powerful enough to be ef-
fective in Rheumatism are safe.
My discovery, now called "Dr. Shoop 9
Rheumatic Cure." acts directly, but in-
ternally, upon Uric Acid in the Joints
and muscles.
It dissolves, and carries off. tha pain-
ful deposits, producing an immediate Al-
kaline condition of the blood, and neu-
tralizing the Acid in it which would
have fed the- Rheumatism and extended,
the disease. < t>
It won't rpstore bony Joints to flexibil-
ity, and it can't undo, in a week, tho
damage caused by years of rheumatio
condition.
But it will benefit every case, afcd it
will entirely cure most cap<?s of Rheuma-
tism. Â¦'.Â¦:..-Â¦
So sure am I of this, that I will supply
Dr. Shoop's Rheumatic Cure, to any sick
one who writes me for It. on a month's
trial, at my risk.
If it succeeds, the cost to him Is only
\ $5.50 for the six bottle treatment.
If it fails, I bear the whole cost my-
: self.
And â he alone shall be the Judge â Â«
shall decide who shall pay.
Surely you will not continue to ruffer
when you can thus get well, at my risk.
I have written an important Treatise
on Rheumatism, telling of Its relief and
cure.
It is free to Rheumatic pÂ«opla.

- NEW YORK, April 5.â At the age of
90, Samuel Mowery has sacrificed his
life at Washington, N. J., to save Wil

Both men lived on the same farm and
were inseparable. They went Into a
meadow to burn off some dead grass.
The flames were fanned by a >brisk
breeze, and soon Drake, who started
the blaze, discovered that his clothing
was on fire. He tottered and fell, cry
ing in a tremulous voice for aid. Mow

out the flames with his cap and bare
hands. Too weak to carry the victim. â¢

CHICAGO, April 5.â The strike riot
ing at the American Can Company|s
plant in this city to-day was fiercer
than it has been at any time, and one
man, John Nichols, lost his life by a
bullet fired, it is said, from a train
on which a number of non-union men
were being taken back to the city
after the conclusion of the day's work.
The fighting began early in the
morning, when 300 Greeks, who have
been employed- during the strike, at
tempted to come to the factory. They
were met at the gates by a large num
ber of union pickets, who attacked
them with stones and clubs. A large
detachment of police had their hands
full to protect the Greeks, when a shot
fired from the crowd aroused the
Greeks to fury. Those of the number
who had entered the factory came
pouring out, armed with knives- and
revolvers, and attempted to attack the
union men and their sympathizers,
who were assaulting the Greeks who
had not reached the gateway. The po
lice, after a desperate ' struggle, man
aged to keep the two bodies of men
apart, drove the Greeks into the
factory and dispersed those on the out
side. In this light a number of men
were severely hurt.
At night when the Greeks left the
plant they were attacked by a mob
fully 1000 strong that pelted them with
sticks, stones and bottles. The police,
however, escorted them to the train
without anybody having been serious
ly injured, although quite* a number
of men on both sides were bruised.
After the Greeks had reached their
train, it Is said, somebody on the cars
fired a shot, the bullet killing John
Nichols instantly.

"When these raids are made the
most aw^ul cruelties are practiced. In
nocent women and children are killed

depopulated. One of these raids was

LOUISVILLE, Ky., April 5.â Dr.
William Morrison, a Southern Presby
terian minister to the Â¦ Congo Free
State, in speaking to the Presbyterian
Ministers' Association here, gave an
impressive recital of the alleged" bar
barities practiced upon the natives of
the Congo Free State by those holding
the power and of the obstacles thrown
in the way of their correction by the
authorities.
"I lived with the people for seven
years," said Dr. Morrison. "Leopold
has there a native cannibal army, of
20,000 men, officered by white Belgians
and armed with repeating rifles." The
men, representing the worst and most
savage type of the natives, were first
caught, then carried far away from
their homes and forced into .this mili
tary service. There, in turn, this can
nibal soldiery is used to compel' the
natives to bring in enormous tribute
of ivory and india rubber. It is worth
noting that the King of Belgium is
to-day reputed the largest dealer in
ivory and rubber in the world.
"As a result of this forced labor and
military service, great and unspeaka
ble cruelties are practiced on the na
tive people. I have seen a number of
times at least 5000 fleeing into the for
estst6 escape from the cannibal sol
diers of King Leopold; I have seen
these soldiers scouring through the
forests, and after catching a number
of men whom the Government wanted
as laborers, going away with the cap
tives tied together by ropes around
their necks. Raids upon villages are
constantly being made. Some of the
people are killed and eaten, others are
hurried away into captivity, and sold;
others are forced yito labor and mili
tary service. I can buy all the slaves
you want at Luebo at from $10 to $15
apiece.
Experts say the strike is a most
lucky one. The cheapness of mining
on the river banks and islands is in
ducement enough, while the richness of
the pay on this particular ' island is
taken by the miners flocking to the
scene as indicating valuable bar dig
gings over a wide area. The theory is
advanced that it is Forty-Mile gold
which may prove to be scattered over
the whole intervening fifty miles of the
Yukon from the mouth of Forty-Mile
Creek.
A shaft forty-five feet deep was sunk
and during the last thirteen feet was
in good pay. More than $1500 was tak
en out in twenty-three successive pans,
and the pans were not picked. The
bars up and down the river for a con
siderable distance from the island have
been staked and lays are being renewed
on the island.

Leopold cl^ Belgium, caused her hus^
band, Prince Philip of Coburg, to have
her detained in a private asylum for

Mattasich arrived at Coswig in an

co-operation of 'a restaurant-keeper
whom he had Initiated into the plan,
but the latter told other persons,
through whom the physician In charge
of the asylum was informed of the
facts in the case., After waiting for
several days in the vicinity to see if
the Princes stook a daily drive, Mat

useless now, for the Princess was no

UNIVERSITY EVENTS
The new hospital is located at the
corner of Broadway and T\venty r eighth
street- and is a frame structure, four
stories in height, .with a high base
ment. It has a frontage on Broadway
of about 275 feet and the outline of the
building is very irregular, which al
lows nearly every room to be lighted
by two or more windows. .The build
ing is lighted by electricity and is
heated by steam, which is generated
in a building separated from the main
structure, which makes, the hospital
proper absolutely safe from any, dan
ger of fire from within.
. I wish to express a word of thanks to the
eistere for their great enterprise, which I
trust will be of lasting benefit to Greater
Oakland. 1 can well appreciate the value of
such an institution, for once, when a young
man. I was nursed through a long. Illness by
the Â¦ sisters of the Catholic church. I. lane
great pleasure In extending to Providence Hos
pital a welcome on behalf of the city of
Oakland. '.Â¦=*.; **V> Â¦ Â¦
Mayor Olney on behair of the city
of Oakland extended a welcome to the
new hospital in a brief address, in
which he said in part:
This institution, the. result of years of labor
by the Sisters of Providence, is worthy of
support from all classes of people, for here
may come all who are ill, regardless of color
or of creed, and great good may be accom
plished by the endowment by wealthy people
of rooms or beds for the use of those who
are unable to pay for flrst-class attendance
in time of Bickness. I hope that those who
can will aid in this work for humanity and
will shara their abundance of the goods of
this world that this Institution may be the
ixwans of helping the poor and needy.
Dr. Adams described in detail the
equipment and furnishings of the ope
rating room and wards, and. was fol
lowed by Judge Melvin, who in a brief
address complimented the Sisters of
Providence on their great work. Judge
Melvin said:
- - It seems to me that all that can possibly
be Bald has already been said by the speak
ers who have preceded me. and it seema a
hopeless ', task to try to tell anything more.
However, I will say that in the future "Greater
Oakland may well be proud of Providence
Hospital."
WELCOME BY 3IAYOK.
.The exercises opened at 3 o'clock,
City Attorney J. E. McElroy presiding.
The blessing was given by Archbishop
Riordan, and was followed by the dedi
catory address by Archbishop Mont
gomery, who said In part:
It gives me groat pleasure to dedicate this
magnificent structure, which will henceforth
bo known as Providence Hospital, to the pur
pose for which it has been erected, and I
wish to express my thanks and the thanks of
the clergy to the Sisters of Providence and
also to the physicians of this city who have
t&ken bo much interest In this great enter
prise. It is a well-known fact that hospitals
of a private or semi-private character are
more generally successful than those operated
by municipal or county governments, for too
often in public Institutions politics Is given
precedence over the healing of the sick.
Lc-ng before the hour at which the
exercises were to'begtnVthe building
was crowded with visftors from both
sides of the bay, who inspected the ope
rating rooms, wards and private rooms,
all of which are equipped and furnished
with the most modern appliances.
BLKSSING BY ARCHBISHOP.
OAKLAND, April 5.â Providence Hos
pital, erected by the Sisters of Provi
dence, and which has Just been com
pleted, was formally dedicated this aft
ernoon by Most Rev. Archbishop Rior
dan, assisted by Most Rev. Archbishop
Montgomery and a large number of
Catholic clergymen, public officials and
prominent laymen cf San Francisco
and Oakland. After the invocation and
blessing by Archbishop Riordan and
the dedicatory address by Archbishop
Montgomery short addresses were de
livered by Mayor Olney, Judge Henry
A. Melvin, City Attorney J. E. McEi
roy and Dr. Frank L. Adams. Music
was furnished by the quartet of St.
Francis de Sales Church, assisted b'y
a choir of the sisters and pupils of
Sacred Heart Convent.
Attorney Church said that his clients
were very much dissatisfied with the
situation. They are hopeful that the
ordinance will be sustained in the
courts, jbut a long lepal fight will be
necessary to settle the controversy.
Meanwhile the crematory people fear
the scavengers will continue In busi
ness and that a small percentage of
the total garbage accumulations will
find its way into the incinerating fur
naces, where, the company declares,
the law says it shall go.
Concerning the Board of Health's at
titude, Inspector Gemmel paid: "I have
been notified that the arrests alVeady
made are sufficient for a test of the law.
I shall make no more unless orders are
issued to carry on the arrests wherever
scavengers are found collecting garb
age."
Attorney. L. S. Church, who. repre
sents .the incinerating company, has
been busy in an effort to force further
arrests. He- asserts that the new. law
is . being steadily violated, that the
scavengers are collecting garbage, that
they are paying no attention to the ex
istence cf. the crematory, and are evi
dently preparing to fight every move
thatshall be made to put them out of
business.
The Foard of Health and the Pacific
Incinerating Company, which holds the
contract for the disposal of the munici
pality's garbage, are at loggerheads. It
is because tho Health Department has
ceased enforcing the new garbage ordi
nance after arresting two scavengers
for collecting refuse that the crema
tory company feels aggrieved. The cor
poration people declare that the law
will avail them - little if prosecution
cease at this juncture.
On the other hand, the Health De
partment inspectors assert that for, the
purposes of testing the, law,, the .two
arrests that have been made are suffi
cient and will serve the. purpose fully
as well as if 100 scavengers were ar
rested.

the young woman has been informed
of what her supposed friend;; have said
about her she has been very despond

the scandal has brought upon her.
"My daughtter did not intend to say
anything of that kind. She has been

what she vras doing. We are all
grieved very much, and she more than
the rrft cf us. She tried to retract it,
but it was too late. Mrs. Fargo is still

the truth. She wishes particularly to
emphasize the statements in regard to
her interview with Miss Engle, in which
Mrs. McDonald says Miss Engle told
her that Bulkeley had ruined her life
by his talk. She does not understand
why Miss Engle sbouid deny saying
this. <]
Mrs. Hutchins wins shown this state
ment to-night, but v she refused to say
anything in reply. She said that her
niece was laboring under a misappre
hension, else she would not have as
sailed her in that uncompromising
manner. She said:*'
I deeply regret that, solely throujrb Mrs.
Hutrhins. this unenviable notoriety has beca
brought upon vs. MKS. I. U. FARGO.
In justice to Mr. Lrwis Bulkrlcy. I- should
like to add a few words to the statement made
abma him by Mrs. Hutchins. When 1 nrst
cam.* t<> the WaJworth last September with my
daughter. Marjorie Fargo, ilrs. Hutcbin<Â» in
ppeaklrg of an episode in Mr. Bulkeley'* life,
when he was only 17 years of age, told me that
be had boon more finned against thin sinning
She also jyjid that he had always be<>n gentle
manly in her hcuso, and th&t though *bf> had
b. en much troubled by college ."indents ua
boardPrs. he had given hrr no trotblr. She
ppoke of him in complimentary trrms to my
(Uiughtrr alwx After Mr. Bulkeley anl my
daughter bwanf better acquainted Mrs. Hutrh
in* U'gan talking to mo constantly of things
dercgatcry to his character. So much was i-aij
that I asked Mr. Hulkeloy if l could t-peak to
his guardian about them. He said that he
Â¦would be giad to have me do so. 1 had an in
terview with his guardian and he sa'.l that the
rtatemrms wvrc entirely without foundation
He spoke highly cf hie ward and taid he con
sidered him a young man of procure.
The statement made by airs. Hulchlns that
ftif sought an Interview with Mr. liulkeley
upon hearing of his engagement is untrue â¢ The
interview was Fought by him and was In refer
ence to a letter belonging to him which had
bÂ«en detained by her. She was insulting and
overhearing to him and the detention of the
loiter was the direct cause of his leaving the
house. Arter Sir. BulkHey hail left the house
Miss Engic the young lady who attempted
WJioide, rnade. this statement to me: "Airs.
Kargr>_ l feave bocn In this house a year while
Mr. JSulkeiey ha* been here and I have never
wen anything wrong in htm. 1 thlnic he is a
F'Â»d young man." Miss Kngle told iry daugh
ter that she thought ilr. Hu'keley incapable of
the d-shcnorable actions Mrs. Hutchins accused
him of. and told her not to mind what was be
ing Mid. She seemed perfectly sincere and
truthful ard we never thought of dirubting her.
To the be.Â«:t of my knowledge, the interview
botwpen MIfs Kngle and Mrs. McDonald was
sought, not by Miss Kngle. but by Mrs. Mo
I.viiiiUI. at Mrs. Hutchins' euggrmUon. and was
in regard to a matter about which Mira Rngle
never sbouid have been troubled. Though Miss
Engle'Â« statement of yesterday completely ex
onerate* Mr. lJalkclcy. I tboughv it only right
that 1 should state what I know to be the facts
in the case.
Mrs. Fargo's attack takes the form of
a commuication to. the press, and in
this Fhe docs not hesitate to assail Mrs.
Hutchins 1 actions in dealing with
young: Bulkeley. She does not even
stop at impaeching the lady's veractiy,
and one of her statements she char
acterizes as "absolutely untrue." She
declares that Mrs. Hutchins' demeanor
toward Bulkeley was unkind and over
bearing; that she took the liberty of
detaining his private letters; that the
motive for her opposition to Bulkeley
was the engagement of lier grandniece,
Miss Fargo, to him. Finally she pays
that the interview of Mrs. Lucy Mc-
Donald with Mi?s Engle on Friday last
was sought at the suggestion of Mrs.
Hutchinr. not of Miss Engle, as Mrs.
Hutchins has slated. Here is what Mrs.
Fargo Â£ays:

claimed on the part of the opposition
that Mcllwaine was dissipated and.

In Mcllwaine"s brhalf, however, it is
stated that th^re was a clause in the

The New York Tribune prints an
interesting Interview with Christian H.
Zeederburg of Buluwayo, in Rhodesia,
Africa, in which that gentleman tells
of the progress of the Cape to Cairo
railroad. Says he:
"The main line of the Cape to Cairo
railroad ' from Cape Town to Bulu
wayo, 1360 miles north, has been open
since 1897. The branch to the north
east runs through Salisbury, the capi
tal of Rhodesia, to the port of Belra,
on the Portuguese coast. The exten
sion of the main line northwest from
Buluwayo runs through the Wanki
coal fields. These are 220 miles from
Buluwayo and the work ; of construc
tion has been pushed on toward the
falls fn the Zambesi or Victoria Falls,
an ; additional distance of DO miles. . .
; 1 "Only twenty miles of this remains
to be built,;: and It: will :probably be
accomplished by. the/end of April. , I
must be back at Caoe. Town by May 3.

THE average reader may be surprised to. learn that
there are more than 5000' irrigated farms in
Oregon. Much has been said about the rain in
the State next north of California on the Pacific Coast.
Indeed, by reason of the copious downfalls from -the skies
the Orcgonians have jocularly been given the title of
"webfooters." This idea will need to be modified in a
degree by the irrigation statistics that have just been re
ceived from the United States Census Bureau. . .;
Oregon finds it; necessary, in order that farming shall
be carried on to the satisfaction of its people, to irrigate
nearly half a million acresjor, to.be exact, 439,981 acres.
Better methods of management are urged and more eco
nomical use of water,' that a greater area may have the
benefits of irrigation. Since 1899 _ /the increase in the
irrigated Oregon area has increased, according to the
official figures, by. 51,671 /acres, or 13.3 peV cent in* three
years, Â¦ the figures in total, . as -given, representing the
conditions'atthe end'of 1902. â¢
In that year Oregon had- 2555 irrigation systems in
operation, representing a total construction cost- of; $2,-

CONVICT'S RIGHTSâ T., Sacramen
to, Cal. Under the following section of
the Penal Code of California a convict
may be restored to citizenship at the
discretion of the Governor:
"At the end of every month' the
board must report to the Governor of
this State the names of all- prisoners
whose terms of imprisonment are about
to expire by reason of the benefits of
this chapter, giving in such report tha
terms of their sentences, the .date of
imprisonment, the amount of total
credits to the date of such report and
the date when their service would ex
pire by limitation of sentence. . The
Governor, at the expiration of the term
for. which any prisoner has , been sen
tenced, less the number of days allow
ed and credited to him. must order, the
release of such prisoner,' by. an order
under his hand, addressed to the war
den of the prison, in such mode and
form as he may deen proper, and with
or without restoration to citizenship,
according to his discretion." â¢.
' The spirit of war moves again in the sluggish breasts
of the Far Eastern combatants. Newchwang has been
placed under martial law -by the Russians and it is not
beyond the range of probability that we may expect at
any time to hear that Admiral Togo has fired another
shot into the Retvizan. Unless friends intervene Russia
and Japan may actually come to blows in a few months.

S SITION.
STRIKING TWO NOTES ABOVE AN
OCTAVE. STRETCHING EXER
CISE.
the legato form of octave playing, and
the student should endeavor to make
his octaves sound as smooth and even
as a single-hand scale, binding the
notes together In such a way that the
flow of tone may be uninterrupted.
Octaves should be practiced In this
way, both with separate hands and the
hands together. To rouse the pupil's
ambition, I can only call to his mind
the liquid octaves of Paderewskl and
De Pachmann, and ask if he (the boy)
cares to let the chance go by of follow
ing in their footsteps, without a seri
ous attempt to the most of everything
there is in him.
There is another way of practicing
octavesâ the light staccato method,
which is also excellent, and is very
beneficial when taken in conjunction
with the methdd just described. In
this octave form the hand is first
raised with the ordinary light-wrist
motion, then, descending quickly,
strikes the octave with a^sharp, rapid
blow, and as quickly spi Ings . upward
into place, spending only a fraction of
a. second on the key-board. The pupil
should take plenty of time before the
spring downward, but once started,
should lose no time in getting back to
the position where his hand Is upraised
in. readiness for the next rapid de
scent.
This octave study should be prac
ticed up and down the scale, with
single and with both hands, and should
be tried In all the different forms,
"twos," "threes," and so forth, not
omitting the arpeggios.
When the pupil has become perfectly
familiar with the three different forms
of octave study given In the lesson to
day he must make a systematic study
of them in all keys. > , "-
It would be well for him to take the
keys chromatically for instance, after
he has made a thorough study of oc
taves in the key of C let him take up
the same thing in the key of D flat.
After the intricacies of the study in
D flat have been mastered he must try
hi8 octaves in the key of D. Then in
E flat, then in E, F, and so on.
Naturally, this is not all to be done
in one day, or a week, or a month, but
it is well to know all the forms, so
that one may., have a variety to choose
from when studying. It not only
helps the student to gain a thorough
mastery over the piano (which, of
course, is the main object in -View) ,
but it prevents monotony' and
helps to keep' the boy interested, as
he cannot possibly be when confined
to a few- scale forms, and a single oc
tave form. .,
* tart, but a little practice will make
everything come risht.
The first octave struÂ« k should be C
and after relaxing once the student
Ehould repeat the exercise, this time
striking the octave D.
Id this way he should go straight up
the 6cale for eight notes or more,
after which he should . return as he
came, being careful to "relax between
each trial of the exercise.
After practicing in this way for
some days the pupil should continue
his study of the exorcise without the
relaxing periods between. By this
time the work Fhould be carried out
Jn the form of one continuous exer
cised up and down the piano, and the
metronome will be found a great help
in preserving the rhythm and so en
abling the exercise to move of itself;
as it were. There should be a regular
"clinch,*' "spring" â clinch, springâ
clinch, spring: â one beat of the metro
nome marking each change of move
ment.
The pupil must not. *ot course, give
up the "relaxing" periods until he can
practice the exercise without tighten
ing the muscles â that must be under
stood at the outset â but Just as soon
as he can he murt drop the relaxing,
eo that he may be able to swing the
exercise along rhythmically.
Naturally all his wrist -muscles will

THE British^ Tibetan expedition under Colonel
Younghusband has had its first clash with the na
tives of the unknown land. N At thfe village of Guru
a detachment of the Tibetan army, under the leadership
of one of the most fanatical Lamas, opposed the further
advance of the British, fired upon them unawares and
were almost annihilated by the desperate charges of the
Indian' Sikhs. By the side of the body of almost every
one of the slain Tibetans was found a gun bearing the
mark of Russian manufacture.
This foray at Guru/ a village, by the way, on the Tib
etan side of the Himalayas well in the Dalai Lama's
province, marks the opening of a new chapter in the his
tory of British dominion in the East. The charges which
were made by the Indian troops were the first of many
which are to be follow and which -are to lead straight
through the gates of the Forbidden City itself. Tibet's
existence as aÂ»land of mystery, a country forbidden to
any one with t white blood in his veins.- is not for long
now. Whatever may have been" the announced intention
of Colonel Younghusband's march over the "roof of
the world," the expected has come to pass and the con
quest of -Tibet is now a thing in the making.
In a recent number of the Century Ekai Kawaguchi, a
Japanese Buddhist, priest who had made his way into
Lassa and there studied the tenets of r his religion and
incidentally the political aspect of the Dalai Lama's gov
ernment, tells at length of Russia's, secret influence
which has-been at work in the capital of the forbidden
land. Tibetan' priests, 1 bought with the gold of Russian
governors along the northern border, had acted as the
emissaries of . the Dalai Lama. Gifts, had been ex
changed between that dignitary and the Czar. What the
.Czar's : gifts were is revealed by thV finding of ' the Rus- â¢
sian guns on the slain at Guru. England was evidently
not unaware of the conditions which this Buddhist priest
reveals in his article when' she allowed' Lord Curzon ;to
dispatch the .Younghusband expedition.
Upon, the acquisition of- a protectorate or a complete
colonial form of government over Tibet depends the in
tegrity of the empire of India" as surely as does the
possession of Korea assure Japan of a continued na
tional existence. England and Japan arc both proceed
ing in the open against a foe, whose darkly veiled move
ments, always stealthy, always forward, are brought to
light only when the prize at their goal is -won. V

Captain McLellan, whose recent voy
age to trie Aleutian Islands in the reve
nue cutter Maiming has had such mem
orable results, found the streams of
Attu and of the other islands crowded
with salmon. On Buldir Island, in 52
degrees 30 minutes north, he found new
fur seal rookeries. That this discovery
may prove to .be of great financial
value may be realized when it is con
sidered that the revenue from the rook
eries of the Pribiloff Islands has
amounted thus far to over $50,000,000.
On Umnak Island the revenue cutter
steamed into' a harbor two miles long
and three-fourths of a mile wide. .
So strongly convinced are some of
the alert men of the northwest that
the Aleutians are now destined to as
sume great importance in the affairs of
the Pacific that a company has been
formed to colonize the archipelago.
Wharves and storehouses are to be
built and trading stations established.
Stock raising is to be begun first on
Akun Island. There, it is estimated,
50,000 head of cattle can find abundant
pasture the year through.
It is claimed that, on account of the
mollifying influence' of the Japan cur
rent, the Aleutian Islands have a more
desirable climate than any part of the
Atlantic seaboard north of Cape Hat
teras. Aside from stock raising, gen
eral agriculture is to be inaugurated.
It is stated that copper, gold, oil and
coal are found on the islands, and that
there is a great abundance of water
power, as in Japan. One town^ called
Jarvis, has already been started fn Lost
Harbor. The problem of transportation
will not have to be solved, as in the

pave wrist studies, which if properly
followed are quite strenuous enough

child's hand i* constantly growing and
the ordinary "relaxing exercises" are
enough in themselves to develop a
good octave hand without need of ex
tra stretching in the earlier stages of

singing old academy songs, which,
strangely enough, he seemed to remem

opened abottle of wine in the cabin of
his ship, the Naniwas, where he exhib

academy raincoat, with "Y. Enouye"

showing this coat, though the weather
was hot and clear, he rushed out on the
quarter-deck and shouted in excellent

ON 'May 4 in the city of Los Angeles the Cjuadrenv
nial General Conference of the Methodist Epis
copal church will open its session. In attendance
upon the conference there will be delegates from all
parts of the United States, missionaries from foreign
fields and the governing heads of the church, thus mak
ing the body one of the most representative assemblages
of church workers of the many which have come to Cali
fornia for their deliberations. .
In view of the enormous increase in the missionary ac
tivities of the church since the last General Conference
in 1900 the subject of the spread of the word promises
to be one of the most important topics of discussion
which will be brought before the delegates. The recent
operations of the missionaries in the -Philippines and
China and the constantly growing exigencies of the mis
sionary fields in those countries will make the Los An
geles conference particularly a notable one forthe work
which it will do in this direction.
According to the report of the missionary society of
the church, which will be submitted at the conference,
the outposts of the missions have been pushed farther
afield into unoccupied territory during the past four years
than at any other time during the recent history of the
church. In Korea the membership in the missionary
conference has grown from 3897 to 6915, in the Philip
pines from a nominal number up to 7842, in Northwest
India from 34,469 to 42,672. The estimated value of all
foreign mission- property has increased from $5,410,
938 to $6,655,058, an advance of $1,244,120. The increase
of the self-supporting capacity, of the foreign missions
over that of four years ago amounts to 37 per cent.
When it takes into consideration that these material
advances in the .work of spreading the gospel have been
accomplished in some instances under the most dis
couraging circumstances the Methodist church should
have just cause for self-congratulation. The Boxer up
risings in the north of China and the floods in the south
and. central regions have made the work" of the mis
sionaries one of great physical risk and sometimes of
little profit. Cholera and the plague in the Indian coun
tries have had to be fought as well as the prejudices
and century-rooted antipathies of the natives. The ex
pansion of the missionary field has made it imperative
that all of these' endeavors be pushed with less and
less of financial assistance from the home offices.
Much has been said and written lately of the* futility
of missionary work on the part of the Christian churches.
It has been argued that the proselytes utilize their con
version for selfish motives, that the presence of mis
sionaries in a heathen country leads to disturbances and
bloodshed often, and that so ardent a prosecution of the
command of Christ to go forth and teach all men the
way of truth is a fruitless waste of energy. The best
disproof of these assertions is to be found in the very
reports such as that of the missionary society, wherein
the tale of added converts to the fold of Christianity is
told from every pagan land.

Three police ; officers of this city are under investiga
tion on the charge that they_ have been deserting their

OUT of the cloud of rumor from the Eastern war
one fact seems to issue, and that is that Korean
soil is'clearof Russians. The Japanese have been
very successful in the use of their transport service in
getting an army of 300,000 men into Korea. Whenever
the forces have met in action the Japanese have seemed
to be victorious, and whenever the Russians have retired
the ground has been occupied by the forces of' the
Mikado. ,
The Russians appear to have made their stand in Man
churia, and now approaches the interesting period^of
the war. It has been the opinion of British military
strategists that' Japan will make a tactical mistake by
penetrating Manchuria. It has been held that it would be
the policy of Russia to lure them into that province. It
is not definitely known whether the ultimate purpose of
Japan extends beyond Korea. Her suspicions ; were
roused by Korean concessions to Russia on the Yalu
'River, which justified the belief that the annexation, of
Korea was intended. The Hermit Kingdom is "~ now
practically Japanese territory. The powers would prob
ably assent to its annexation. If Japan be willing to ac
cept this as a substitute for her former conquest of Man
churia in the war with China, the road is open for the
good offices of other governments to end the war. Rus
sia would lose prestige, but would hold her footing in
Manchuria, and Japan would gain more than her ancient
rights in Korea.
But Japan has a plan, that is not known to the out
side world. She knows the strength of Russia and has
counted the cost of a campaign and the chances of suc
cess. The effrontery of Russia rankles still at Tokio.
After the Chinese war Port Arthur and all that part of
Manchuria now occupied by Russia was ceded to Japan.
Then Russia appealed to Germany and the rest of Eu
rope to nullify the. treaty of cession on the ground that
to cede a part of Manchuria to Japan would be a dismem
berment of China! Japan was forced to relinquish her
conquest and accept the wild island of Formosa, as the
barren fruit of her victory. Russia then immediately
took the part of Manchuria that Japan had been com
pelled to relinquish, and Germany got territory on the
Gulf of Pechili as her pay for her part in the transac
tion. In all history there is hardly a more rank trans
action. If Japan have the ability to whip Russia and take
Manchuria, .whether she keep it or restore it to China,
the believers in fair play will rejoice.
Russia is again trying to scare the world by the cry of
Pan-Mongolism and the specter of the yellow peril. In
this country, where we have been long in contact with
Japanese statesmanship, there is no response to this
tocsin, nor is there, we believe, in Great Britain. If
China, Korea and Japan are in combination, with Japan
as leader and teacher, the world has nothing to fear from
Pan-Mongolism. China and Korea are as capable of re
ceiving all that can be assimilated of Western civilization
as Japan has proved'to be/and it is better that they do
this, independently, than that they be seized and ex
ploited by any of the Western nations.
The woes of the East have been caused by European
ambitions and aggrandizement. At this moment Great
Britain, fearful of the appearance of Russia in Tibet,
menacing her Indian frontier, is*in that country on a
mission of slaughter that sickens the world. The peo
ple of the, land are the innocent victims of one European
plbwers suspicion of the motives of another, and are be
ing slain in an issue to which they are not parties. Ever
since Russia crossed the Amur she has been making a
shambles of Manchuria. Given Pan-Mongolism and
autonomy, and we will see progress and civilization in
Eastern Asia under the intelligent leadership of Japan,
and peace and happiness and development will take the
place oLwar and destruction.
We are not aware that anywhere in the United States
is there any fear that the interests of the world will
suffer from such a solution of the Eastern problem. If
the good offices of the friendly, powers should be asked
and used effectively in ending the war, by leaving Japan
in Korea and Russia in Manchuria, it would be a settle
ment that would give secondary satisfaction. It would
imply such restrictions upon Russian occupation of Man
churia as would protect Japan at home and in Korea
and enhance her influence in China.
Russia is still inflamed against the United States, and
the St. Petersburg press is flouting at "the ungrateful
Yankees," while they boast of service rendered in our
Civil War. That service is written only in the political
Apocrypha of forty years ago. But granting it was
what the Russians claim it was, it is no reason why we
should support Russia in a policy of conquest, injustice
and murder.
Our Government has maintained, a severe neutrality
and will continue to do so. Our people are free. They
60 not have a nobility and aristocracy to think for
them. They think for themselves, and Russia must learn
that in a free country the attitude of the. Government is

The pupil's aim should be to keep his

lead the hand and arm up and down
the scale, as in the "water motion." so
often brought in to aid us. This Is
The pupil must not try to play his
octaves loo rapidly; he is trying for
flexibility and tone now, and if he ac
quires these the rapidity will take care
of itself.
In conjunction with this the pupil
should take up the study of octaves
with the limp wrist. These should be
practiced in scale fashion. First very
slowly (with one hand), relaxing be
tween each note, and keeping time with
the metronome, which should be set
at a very slow figure. Next the exer
cise should be practiced in "twos" (ac
cording to directions for scale prac
tice given in former lessons). Here
every other note should be accented,
and the time of the exercise will, of
course, be' twice as rapid as in the
first form. Next it should be tried in
"threes," emphasizing every- third
note. Next in fourths, with the usual
rules.
If the pupil, by reason of the natural
inelasticity of his hand, is unable to
strike an octave. at all, he should first
try the exercise with seven notes in
stead .of eight. That is, he should
strike C and B rather than C and C,
and so on up and down the scale,
striking a seventh each time instead
of .an eighth. He should, however,
stretch his hand with all his might
each time, trying for the octave every
little -while. Â»
When the student finds that he can,
after some weeks of study in this way,
p!ay octaves with ease let him try
stretching one note beyond an octave
â that is. nine notes. Some people's
hands are naturally so flexible that
they can do this with very little prac
tice, but in the majority erf cases it is
not so, and practice of this sort is a
good thing, for occasionally the pupil
will come across some musical" pas
sage where there is a chord, the sound
of which would be improved if two
notes, nine notes apart, could be played
by one hand, without having either to
be slurred, in arpeggio fashion, or, as
is generally the case, a compromise
effected by means of which the other
hand is called in to solve the difficulty
and strike o-ne of the notes. It is, of
course, always much more artistic to
strike notes as they are written, for
one does not like to feel that one has
anj' limitations, particularly in a mat
ter of technique, where the difficulty
can be overcome by patient study. Care
must be taken, however, not to over
strain the muscles, and this exercise
should not be indulged in longer than
a few moments daily.

Commissioner Blnger Hermann of the
General Land Office, In June, 1902.
This was when the Government first
got conclusive evidence that crooked
work was going on, with which it now
alleges the defendants were connected.
William E. Valk, McPhaul's prede
cessor in the lieu land division, was
recalled for further questioning by the
defense, and Charles S. Wheeler, of
counsel for Dimond. tried to repair the
damage done by the witness in his
statement on Friday that Dimond had
come to him privately in Washington
with a note from Benson, saying in
substance, "This man represents me
and he is all right." Valk admitted
that his recollection as to the kind of
paper, style /of writing, and. exact
wording was vague, but stuck to his
declaration as to the gist of the com
munication.
"Did you have any social relations
with Dimond?" asked Heney, when
the witness was turned over to him
for cross-examination.
"'Yes. We often drank' together, and
I dined with him several times."
The hearing will continue this morn
ing.
DEFENDANTS HAD A "PULL."
On cross-examination the witness
testified to many suspicious circum
stances connected with these cases.
One was the speed with which the
Hyde-Benson cases had been rushed
through." hundreds of them having
been advanced out of their regular
order, apparently aa a result of "pull"
or other Influence well applied.
McPhaul showed that all the relin-

failed to introduce any evidence de
stroying the presumption of guilt
raised by the indictment. Whether
they will do so is a question to be an
swered by their course hereafter."
HAVE PROVED NOTHING.
This explicit statement that the Com
missioner had not.been Impressed with
the case thus far made by defendants
more than, offset any exultation they
may have felt over their success in
holding Heney down to strict cross-ex
amination of the Government's own
witnesses.
Much of the day was spent in the ex
amination of John McPhaul, the prin
cipal"examiner in the lieu division of
the General Land Office. He testified
before the Grand Jury and was called
yesterday by the defense. He testified
at length as to several land transac
tions named in the indictment. In one
case the witness had discovered that
640 acros of the school land assigned by
the defendants on what purported to
be a title from Oregon had never been
surveyed. Therefore it had never
passed out of the Government's own
ership, and Oregon had no title to con
vey. In some cases the selections had
been rejected because the defendants
had duplicated their relinquishments,
offering the same school lands as a base
for different sslections. The witness
admitted that sometimes the defend
ants had been permitted to correct the

After consultation with Judges Mor
row and De Haven, the Commissioner
paid he would sustain the defendants'
objection to Heney's line of questions.
But he added: "I think this is the log
icaj position for me in view of the
Government's action in resting oji the
indictment and refusing, to put In other
evidence the defense contra
dicts it with substantial testimony.
Â¦ The earlier part of the day was un
eventful, save that it began as it
closed, with a blow to the defense.
Commissioner Heacock announced hi3
decision regarding Heney's efforts on
cross-examination to show that while
Government witnesses. Corbett, Mc-
Cusker et al, had no acquaintance or
correspondence with Hyde or Dimond,
they had had dealings with Benson or
Schneider, the other alleged conspira
tors.
"Mr. Heney's offer to the defense
seems to me a fair one," Heacock said,
in sustaining the Government's objec
tion to McEnerney's question. "I have
already held that the indictment
makes a prima facie case and that the
defense is not entitled to know in ad
vance the evidence on which it was
based. Hence I will not compel the
witness to answer."
So the issue was joined. The ten
sion in the courtroom was tremendous.
After it -was all over Burns safd he
was prepared to refuse to answer Mc-
Enerney's question and would have
gone to jail rather than answer unless
ordered by Government counsel to tell
what letters of Hyde's the prosecution
has ud its sleeve.
"We Intend to prove," said Mc-
Enerney, "that among all the docu
ments this witness has seen there was
nothing of an incriminating nature
and nothing that warrants the hold
ing of the defendant, Hyde."
WOULD GO TO JAIL.
It was th*Â» old fight in a new form.
Ever since the hearing began the at
torneys for Defendants Hyde and Di
mond have been trying to force the
Government to produce the evidence
on which the indictment was returned,
and, in spite of Commissioner Hea
cock's repeated adverse rulings that
the indictment' established a presump
tion of guilt, which the defense must
contradict by positive testimony be
fore the Government could be com
pelled to disclose its case, lhey have
gone merrily on repeating the same
effort under . different disguises day
after day. Many of the Government
witnesses have been called to show that
they knew nothing to' the discredit of
Hyde or Dimond â a. negative state
ment easily established, as their
Grand Jury testimony had been
against the other members of the al
leged conspiracy. But in Burns tlie
defense had one of the prosecution's,
strongest witnesses and they proposed
to handle him accordingly.
"This is not a fishing excursion, but
an opportunity for the defense to show
their innocence if they can do so. In
order to aid them, we will make this
offer to Mr. McEnerney: If he- will
name any particular paper or letter
written by Hyde which is in our pos
session and which he needs for his
case we will produce it. Otherwise we
shall not consent that this Government
drtective, who has worked up the case,
and who knows all the documentary
evidence on which the Grand Jury
acted, shall be used to assist the de
fense in escaping the effect of your
Honor's decision."
"We object to the question," shouted
Francis J. Heney. special counsel to the
Government. "The defendants are sim
ply trying to find out if we have any
documentary evidence that will dis
prove anything Hyde may say here
after ou the witness stand. They want
to get hold of our case, so that they
may manufacture a defense to fit it.
We do not propose to furnish them
with the testimony given before the
Grand Jury until they have presented
evidence to contradict the indictment.
Your Honor has ruled several times
that our position is correct.
NO FISniXG KXCCRSIOX.
"I am regularly connected with the
secret service work of the Treasury
Department," Burns had replied to Me-
Enerney's preliminary questions, "but
was especially detailed to take charge
of this case as the agent of the Gen
eral Land Office. I first saw the de
fendant Hyde about 1901, when I came
here to work up the Dimmick cases
for the treasury, but I am not person
ally acquainted with him and have had
no correspondence with him." Then
McEnerney probed deeper.
"Tcs," said Burns, answering: him;
"I have seen many of Mr. Hyde's let
ters and papers relating- to the land
cases and matters covered by the in
dictment, but I cannot say where they
are now. I had them in my awn pos
session for a time and turned them over
to Judge Pugh at the Interior Depart
ment in October last."
"What were these letters and papers,
Mr. Burns?" the attorney asked.
The secret service man made no an
swer. <i
days that preceded it. William J.
Burns, the famous Government detec
tive, had been called to the stand by
the defendants in the course of their
daring attempt to use the witness lor
the prosecution to break down the in
dictment found by the Federal Grand
Jury at Washington on the testimony
of these very witnesses. Garret W. Mc-
Enerney, who has the interests of De
fendant Fred A. Hyde especially in
charge, was trying to force Burns to

PORTLAND, Or., April 5.â A bomb,
containing two pounds of powder,
heavily charged with nitrogyclerin
and containing a box of 100 detonating
caps, was found on the guard rail of
the steamer Albany of the Western
Transportation Company's line to-day.
The fuse had been .burned almost to
the cap, but had gone. out. Had the
bomb exploded the Albany would
doubtless have been completely wreck
ed and much other damage done.
From the fact that a quantity of
Chinese tissue paper and^ a white sock,
such as is worn by Chinese, were
wrapped around the infernal 'machine,
it is thought that the plot to destroy
the steamer; was evolved by Chinese.

Of poor blood circulation is shortness of

Whether Madame Schumann-Heink
reminds more of Nordica or of Mr.
Denis O'Sullivan .is difficult to decide.
The singer gave the first of her three
recitals at the Alhambra last night
to an audience that reserved no en
thusiasms. Its Easter hat, too, was
in complimentary evidence, together
with a general spring air about things.
Perhaps of the great Grau sextet we
had here in the dear, dead' days of three
years ago, Sembrich, Melba, Nordica,
Gadski, Calve, Schunjann-Heink, the
contralto is best, because uniquely re
membered. There was only one con
tralto â we haven't forgotten her, to
Judge by the numbers tucked into the
Alhambra last night. And when she
walked out, be-medaled round that
noble decolletage of hers like a Dewey,
and with her mirthful brown eyes al
most lost in her smile, we did not for
get to cheer. -; X'
We have heard since her appearance
here of the contralto's comic opera en
gagement for this year. There were
some to wonder what that meantâ
further than that the roguish Madda
lena of "Die Meistersinger" was about
to illume the comic opera she is so
brilliantly fitted to adorn. It means
evidently just this, that Madame
Schumann-Heink will appear in comic
opera* because she will, not because,
say, Wagner, in the solemn slang of
the moment, has "ruined hei* voice." .
Hardly. The voiceâ ah, such a. voice!
An opulent, vivid, luscious "volume of
sweets â is in its freshest prime. The
singer seems never to touch the re
serves of its power. She sings one big
thing after another without the slight
est sign of fatigue. , the voice as se
renely pure at the end of_ the pro
gramme as at the beginning. There
may be another such voice and with, a
brain behind it like Sehumann-Heink's,
but f the possibility is easily doubtful.
Our city halls have echoed to none such
in my experience, nor, I fancy, "are
likely to. â¢Â¦ . â¢"â¢â¢â¢Â¦
Perhaps. there is a less vividly intel
lectual quality in Hchumann-Heink's
musical speech than in Nordica's, but
there is the same dramatic verve, abso
lute technical authority and wide range
of sympathy. And the vocal â¢ quality.
Take the Nordica voice, run it down to
that deep E of "Der Wanderer," hon
eyed and heady like old mead, and you
have the Schumann-Heink. organ.. One
noted it -in the unforgotten. glories of
"Lohengrin,"- where the sister voices of
the two were interwoven beyond recog
nition. The Denis O'SuIlIvan resem
blanceâour brilliant expatriate- has

The fun, the dithyramblc dash, the
heart, the lively f eryor, \ besides all the
other gifts that make Denis O'Sullivan.
a born singer of songs, make Schumann-
Heink equally such. In fact, she is as
much at home'in concert as' in. opera.

Except the first, a facile'Tind pretty
thing, they were worth little beyond
what Schumann-Heink lent them. A
beautiful "Widmung" then roused the
attendant fatherlanders to hysterical
fiights of appreciation and the rest of
us to following suit.

It Is the quantity of fish that each
boat should catch that is disturbing the
evenness of the fishermen up north
this season and not the rate of wages.
The rate heretofore allowed each boat
on a catch was fixed at 1000; this year
the men want the limit increased to
1300. with the Drices as before: 2 cents
each for dogfish. 2% cents for red and
silverslde flsh, and 10 cents for salmon,
with $50 for crewing the vessels to and
from Astoria to the fishing grounds.
The difference being so little it Is
thought that the canneries will yield
rather than get Into a tangle # with
their men at this time, when every day
counts in the general catch for the
season.

It se^ms a rumor has beon Being around that
the company jjrnj>o!u?ii to declare a lockout nnd
to dcptroy the Carmen's Union. This is calcu
lated to irritate the ir.en and cr.Iist outside
*ymnathy. Th* etory is untrue. The company
Manager Chapman, referring to the
visit of President Cornelius and Secre
tary Bowlinsr, said they had broached
to him j;esterday a proposition that
the company stop hiring men for the
jrresent and continuing he said:
In a statement issued late last niph*
the union claims that it has absolute
proof that the company Is preparing
for a strike by storing provisions in

tar barns and is employing new men
from different parts of the country at
th? rate of ten a day and pledging
them not to join the local union.
Last night the union held a meeting
and adopted resolutions condemning
the action of the company in hiring ad
d'Uonal men, who, it is claimed, are
being engaged for the purpose of an
ticipating a probable strike and the
president of the union was instructed to
notify President Holland of the United
Kailroads that if the company did not
Immediately cease employing new men

that the reply was not ready, but in all

Six years have wrought, changes in
memories, although not in beliefs.
When Mrs. Botkin was first tried 8he
was convicted and a sentence of life
imprisonment was imposed on her.
The verdict was reversed by the Su
preme Court on technical grounds
arfd the present trial resulted.
The defendant herself was the first
witness called during the, proceeding
yesterday. She took the stand at the
request of the District Attorney. Three
In the closing testimony of the
prosecution there was n > evidence of
a sensation, which all throughout the
trial has been promised. Less dramat
ically than the opening was the closing
of a case wherein a woman's life is
tip-tilted with a possible verdict that
the rough strands of a hemp rope
may leave marks on her throat that
will testify truthfully to the manner
of her death.
The evidence connecting Cordelia
Botkin with the. murder of Mrs. John
P. Dunning is in. All that remains of
the trial is the argument of the counsel
for .the defense and the closing argu
ment of District Attorney Byington.
Twelve men In the Jury box will de
cide the question whether or not Mrs.
Botkin caused the death of Mrs. John
P. Dunning and Mrs. Joshua P. Deane
in August, lÂ£9S,in Dover. Del., by send
ing to the former, from this city, a box
of poisoned candy.
The testimony of both sides was con
cluded yesterday afternoon. Among
the features were the reappearance of
Mrs. Botkin herself, called by the pros
ecution In regard to the authorship of
the anonymous letters alleged to have
been sent to Mrs. Dunning. John P.
Dunning was called by the prosecution
on an unimportant fact, and Attorney
McGowan, for the defense, asked Dun
ning a question that was quickly ob
jected to by the prosecution, and the
objection was sustained by Judge Cook.
The embarrassing question was:
"Are you not ashamed of some of the
testimony you gave on the stand dur
ing this trial?"
Dunning wagged his head negatively,
but before the spoken words of his de
nial could creep into the record the
prosecution shut off his verbal reply.
Mrs. Botkin was called to testify re
garding her knowledge of one of the
anonymous letters. The craning necks
of an unusually large number of
women followed her as ehe wobbled to
the witness stand. Gowned in black
and heavy beyond an excuse of fatness,
Mrs. Botkin went to the front at the
call of District Attorney Byington.
There was nothing in her appearance
that would suggest the picture of a
woman who is alleged to have ruined
a home by her attractiveness.
SENSATION" NOT ''SPRUNG.
Under the ordeal of the opening argu
ment Mrs. Botkin lost the wonted fliuh
in her cheeks and her ordinarily tense
lips grew into a straight line. Her
hands were nervous and the neck mus
cles twitched, but there was no other
indication of a physical breakdown, as
has been told by prophets.
Assistant District Attorney Ferral oc
cupied more than an hour during his
argument in the afternoon session, and
when adjournment time came Judge
Cook announced that a night session
would be held. At S o'clock^last night
Assistant District Attorney Ferral fin
ished his argument and closed at 10:20.
To-day Attorney Knight will make
the opening argument for the defense.
Argument of counsel was in order,
and Assistant District Attorney Ferral
left his seat and faced the Jury. Dur
ing the first part of his terrific arraign
ment of the defendant his voice was
bad, but he warmed up In a few min
utes and thereafter his denunciations
rang out clearly and coldly, like the
snapping of a pine under stress of frost.
FERRAL OPENS.
Copies of a dally paper published in
this city were packed into, the court
room by G. G. Weigel to show that
certain interviews with reporters al
leged by the prosecution were never
printed. This ended the testimony.
When Dunning walked into the court
room on the demand of the District At
torney Mrs. Botkin talked excitedly for
one minute to Attorney McGowan.
After that Dunning testified as to a se
cured loan he obtained from Mrs. Cor
bally, the woman of mystery in the
trial. He said that the transaction
was entirely proper and that he never
had illicit relations with the woman in
question. On cross-examination At
torney McGowan asked the witness a
question regarding his lack of shame.
It was ruled out by the court.
Charles Brown, purser of the steamer
Pomona in 1897, called by the defense,
told that when he acted In the capacity
named the steamer carried mail. This
testimony was introduced to support
the defense in its theory that one of
the anonymous letters, which has been
"declared to be in Mrs. Botkin's hand
writing, could hot have been mailed by
her because it was postmarked at San
Francisco on N a date when f she was in
Humboldt County.
been poisoned and sent to Mrs. Dun
ning at Dover. Delaware.
Mrs. Smith was retired after a
declaration that a doctor might have
visited Mrs. Botkin on the date in ques
tion unknown to the witness.

WlLIi PLANT HISTORIC
OAK AT WHITE HOUSE
Secretary Hitchcock Will Supply Sap
ling That Has an Interesting
" " History.
WASHINGTON, April 5.â A historic
oak sapling will be planted in the
White House grounds next Thursday.
Secretary Hitchcock will supply the
tree and in connection therewith, to
day told the President a pretty story.
Many years ago, Charles Sumner
sent to the Czar of Russia some acorns
from a stately oak which overhangs
the tomb ! of Washington at Mount
Vernonl The 'Czar caused the acorns
to be planted in^ the grounds of the
Peterhof palace," in St. Petersburg.
One of the acorns grew into a mag
nificent oak which stands in the palace
grounds.
While In St. Petersburg in 1898 as the
X T nited States Embossador to Russia
Hitchcock collected a handful of
acorns from the historical offspring of
the Mount Vernon oak, sent them . to
this country and had them planted in
the grounds at his Missouri home.
Some of them developed into fine sap
lings and it is one of them that is to
be planted In the White House grounds
on Thursday. The planting, . which Is
to be done at the Instance of President
Roosevelt, will be without ceremony.
It was announced March 23 from Ber
lin that the engagement of the Crown .
Prince Frederick William to Princess'
Alexandra of Brunswick end Lun*Â«
burg, the Duke of Cumberland's sec~;
ond (laughter, which was rmnored to>;
be under negotiations last year, at thai
time Emperor William visited Copen-Â»
hagen, and which was then denied, ap
parently had some basis In fact, but
was . frustrated by the Dnke of Cum
berland's sudden departure from Cop
enhagen Just before the Emperor's arÂ»
rival. According to the Brunswick
Landes Zeltung, the Emperor resented
the Duke's departure, and character
ized it as an affront, adding to a highf
military personage in his entourago
that he would not again run after ths
Duke. The Landes Zeltung vouched
for this story In such a way as to war
rant the conclusion that It emanated
from the Brunswick Ministry.
Dr. l5othe. the City Chemist, said the
move was a good one and that he
found that all thA samples submitted
to him, including poor ones, run above
3.5. without any truce of the use of
preservatives, except in one sample
submitted.
Samuel Poorman. one of the direct
ors of the Bay Counties Commercial

lower percentage of butter fat during
the spring months, when the soft green
feed is fed to the stock, as compared
with that of the fall, when the rich,

ted that the contracts with the dealers
last year called for 3.6, but claimed
that at times, it was impossible to keep
up to that standard. Mr. Poorman
maintained that pure cow's milk of

ard should be raised to 3.5 butter fat.
IJe read from reports of the depart
ment that the analysis of samples sub
mitted to the City Chemist rince last
August showed that the butter fat was
in excess of the 3.5 standard. Major
Robinson contended that the 3.2 stand
ard allows the milkmen to add water
without fear of detection.
Deputy Health Officer Louis Levy
t-ald the Board of Health had recom
iuÂ»Â»rdÂ«?d the raising of the percentage
upon the suggestion of Health Officer
P.agan and that since the New York
authorities had adopted the same
ttandard infantile mortality had been
greatly decreased. Levy said the
rresent health board intended to pro
tect the infants of this city and that
It would be the endeavor of that
branch of the city government to pee
that the public received good milk.
FEED IMPORTANT FACTOR.
Milk was the one absorbing topic at
the Joint meeting of the Health and
Police Committees of the Board of Su
pervisors yesterday afternoon, and
everything appertaining to the subject
was thoroughly discussed. The meet
ing had been called to consider the re
quest of the Board of Health that the
oxtsting milk ordinance be amended so
that the necessary percentage of but
ter fat be raised from 3.2 to 3.5. Su
pervisors D'Ancona and Alpers of tht
Health, and Su:>ervisor loggers of the
l"Ollee Committee, attended the meet
ing and D'Ancona presided. A number
<Â»f milk producers from neighboring
< ountk'S were present, in addition to
the representatives of the local milk
fiealoFs.
| The change in the head of the de
partment does hot mean a wholesale
change in the subordinate positions,
the members of the department being
under civil service rules. The Mayor,
however, under the provisions of the
city charter, dominates the department
and is practically its head. This means
that there will be no change of policy
in "the police administration.
In the resignation which he present
ed Elton referred to the adverse criti
cism of him and his department and
demanded a complete, investigation.
After he had been relieved of his posi
tion he was told that hla demand for
investigation would be granted if he
desired, and two weeks from to-day
was set for the hearing. Hammel will
take charge of the Police Department
to-morrow.
LOS ANGELES, April 5.â After a
stormy session, in which there.- were
liberal exchanges of bitter personali
ties, the Board of Police Commissioners
to-day accepted the resignation - of
Charles Elton as Chief of Police of Los
AngeleB and appointed former Sheriff
Will A. Hammol to succeed him.
Special Dispatch' to The Call.
The. committee informed the board
that there are many defects In the ex
isting ordinances governing the erec
tion and construction of buildings and
that these defects should be remedied.
The theater ordinance was character
ised as being prohibitory in its terms.
It wag deemed advisable by the com
mittee that the measure be so modified
as to exempt churches, schoolhouses
and theaters having a capacity of less
than a designated number of specta
tors and employing not more than three
musicians from Its provisions.
When asked to specify other defects
in the building ordinance the commit
tee coulU only ansjtver as to general
pro-visions, and this Ehowing did not
satisfy the Board of Works.
'"Before this board makes any recom
mendations to amend the building ordi
nance." said Commissioner Schmitz, "it
will have to be satisfied that the modi
fications are warranted by the facts in
the case. The mistakes in the ordi
nance, if such there are, are not clear,
and before taking any action I would
ask this committee to submit in writ
ing a list of the particular changes it
desires made. This is an important
matter and should not be acted on
hastily, as once the ordinances are
amended it will be for all time. I un
derstand that the local architects were
consulted before the ordinances were
passed and the errors should have been
noticed at that time."
The committee promised to submit a
list of desired amendments, which the
Board of Works will consider before
making any recommendations to the
Board of Supervisors.
The Board of Public Works held a
conference yesterday with a commit
tee from the San Francisco Chapter of
Architects relative to proposed amend
ments to the building and theater ordi
nances. The committee consisted of
W. H. Mooser, Lionel Deane, 8.

, Lilly Moore, a professional nurse,
came to her death yesterday from the
effects of poison administered by her
self, but whether by accident or sui
cidal intent remains for a Coroner's
Jury to decide. She came to this city
about five years ago from . New York,
where her relatives reside, but their
whereabouts- is not known to her ac
quaintances here.
Since her arrival she. had spent most
of her time at different asylums in the
interior of the State, acting as a nurse.
When in tho city Bhe had resided at
1926 Market street. .When she returned
to town two weeks ago, after being ab
sent for a time, Bhe registered aa "Mrs.
Devine." Mrs. Alice Straub, the land
lady where- she stopped; said: "Mrs. De
vine, or Lilly Moore, as she previously
called herself, was always very quiet
about tho house. She spent most of her
time nursing in the country. .
"Monday morning she told me she
had been suffering from aheadache, but
felt better and was -going nursing in
the afternoon. About. 12 o'clock she
came rushing down the stairs, scream-
Ing and crying and highly hysterical.
She cried: 'I have taken morphine and
I have taken too much.' My husband
rushed around the neighborhood and
finally succeeded In getting Dr. A. J.
Minaker. When the doctor came she
was unconscious and remained so un
til she died yesterday at 2 p. m. I don't
know what caused her to take the mor
phine, and I don't know of any trouble
that she had with anybody. Occasion
ally a gentleman used to come and see
her, but I don't know his name."
Dr. Minaker said: "When I arrived
at the room of the woman who had
taken the morphine I found her partly
unconscious and evidently in great
agony. From the first symptoms I
could not tell whether it was alcohol
ism, hysteria or poisoning. I decided
from her bulging eyes and light con
vulsions that it must be poisoning, and
applied the usual remedies, which re
lieved the stomach of its contents.
"She had no friends, in the house,
and I happened to glance at the bu
reau and saw the name of H.. C.
Devighne, so I immediately telephoned
to him to come. He did so, and re
mained and took care of her till she
died. It certainly is a peculiar case.
In the room I found a small empty
phial labeled 'Morphine and atropine.'
She may have taken" a dose" of this,
but I cannot say. ' She never was con
scious after I arrived. I remained in
constant attendance until midnight on
Monday, when I saw that she was
Finking and was past medical aid;
but under my instructions stimulants
were administered in the possible hope
of reviving her." .
H. C. Devighne, the young man Who
was called at Dr. Minaker's sugges
tion, states that he knew the deceased
in New York five years ago, and that
they had kept up an acquaintance
after her arrival here till about two
and a half years ago, when she visit
ed the country in her professional ca
pacity, and he had only seen her oc
casionally during that period.
He added that she had always been
WASHINGTON, April 5.â The Senate
to-day listened to a two hours' speech
by Morgan on the Panama canal ques
tion and" then again tooK up the post
office appropriation bill, but adjourned
without completing its ' consideration.
Some important amendments aside
from those suggested by the commit
tee were agreed to, among them one
increasing from two to four ounces the
size of franked- . letters, and another
adding" twenty-five members to the
force, of the rural free delivery agents.
Morgan's speech was In especial ad
vocacy of his resolution requesting In
formation from the Attorney General
concerning concessions to the original
Panama Canal Company, and was in
the main an arraignment of the new
Panama Canal Company.
When the postofHce appropriation bill
was laid before the Senate amendments
were adopted without â¢ objection, until
the Senate committee provision con
tinuing the contract with the Oceanic
Steamship Company and appropriating
$45,000 for . transporting the malls by
its steamships sailing from San Fran
cisco to Tahiti was reached.
Perkins explained the item and said
it was impossible to operate the Ta
hiti steamship line without the aid of
the United States, and there was no
other way in which an efficient mall
service could be maintained at the pres
ent time.
Objection to the renewal of the con
tract was made by Teller on the ground
that it was a "plain subsidy." He ob
jected to the payment of $45,000 for the
conveyance of malls to islands where
"the interests of the United States are
inconsequential." .â¢
The Senate amendment renewing the
contract was agreed to.

FRESNO, April 5. â In a game, the
shortest of the season and one full of
good ball, Tacoma won from San
Francisco this afternoon -in the first
game of the series by a score of 2 to 1.
Overall pitched for Tacoma and was
in great form. After the first inning,
in which San Francisco made their
only run, Overall was hit for only two
safe drives. He struck few men out,
but Uncle Harris" boys could not con
nect effectively with his benders. The
score was as follows:

PHILADELPHIA, April 5. â Herr
Placke, the champion pugilist of Hol
land, made a sorry spectacle of himself
to-night in a fight with Kid McCoy at
the Lenox Athletic Club. Standing
six inches taller and weighing 7S
pounds more than his pale-faced oppo
nent, he was beaten almost into insensi
bility in less than four minutes. Placke
never laid a glove upon McCoy except
when the men clinched, and the cool,
calculating McCoy darted in and out
and around his burly opponent almost
like lightning. He would feint with
his right and then drive his left to the
face viciously, scarcely ever failing to
bring the blood. Twice in the first
round Placke was covered by blood
from his waist to his neck and his eyes
were almost closed. Just before the
gong sounded announcing the close of
the first round McCoy drove a vicious
left flush to the chin, dropping Placke
like a log.
The gong saved - him from . being
knocked out. He was carried to his
corner, only to be knocked out ten sec
onds after the second round was. called.
McCoy feinted with the right and then
drove his left square to the point of
Placke's nose. The latter intuitively
placed his left hand over the damaged
organ and dropped to his knees. The
blood was running from him in a
stream. As he knelt by the ropes the
pojice appeared in the ring and stopped
the flght. The fight by rounds:

SECOND ROUND
PLACKE'S FINISH
Referee McDevitt stopped the bout
between Patsy Hogan In . the first
round, awarding it to the former.
Neither man could fight a little bit.
The flght between Thurston and Wil
liams provided ten rounds of as des
perate slugging as ringgoers have seen
In many days. Williams was game
and took a terrific punching about the
body. Neither showed any science, but
they kept up a fast pace from first to
last. The spectators cheered them re
peatedly for their efforts. The decision
went to Thurston.
Jimmy Brltt entered the building just
before the men appeared fn the ring
and there were loud calls for him. Billy
Jordan presented him to the spectators
as the tamest little champion in the
world. A speech was called for and
Jimmy said: "I thank you one and all
for this kind reception. If Toung Cor
bett is dissatisfied with what I did to
him the other night I will do it over
again."

that Don Domo, Double Six, Atwood

though not a steady habitue of the
game, but usually arrives on time,
was installed favorite at 11 to 5. The
108 pounds set a bit too snug, and she
finished next to last. Powell beat the
others away from the . webbing with
Hagerdon, and Jimmy Jones on At
wood was the only, one to get at all in
quisitive. H. L. Franks' big gelding
held the three-year-old safe, though,
leading him over the line more than a
length, with something in reserve. Don
Domo could not get to the front and
on the stretch turn looked all in.
Bonner finished third astride Albula,
An excellent card, warm, balmy
weather and a fast track for the
horses to race over, drew a large
crowd. And while Matt Hogan was
the only successful favorite, the sport
was good, and every event well con
tested.
"Big Bill" Knapp had the mount on
Aunt Polly, the 2% to 1 favorite for
the first, a' six-furlong selling sprint.
The mare wore down the lead of the
light- weighted Crigli, . which fairly
flew for five-eighths of a mile, and was
in turn collared and beaten out by Oro
Viva, the second choice. Bonner rode
the latter horse to good advantage.
Holbrook did not putup a very aggres
sive ride on Shell Mount, landing Just
beyond the money.
With his next mount "Knapp was
more successful. Bill tossed the leg
over Flrelia, a 12 to 1 shot in the bet
ting on the two-year-old scramble, and,
getting away well, came home two
lengths ahead of Velna, another out
sider. Bozeman' started away from the
barrier using his whip, on Hooligan, the
opening favorite, clinched his hold on
fourth position and finished there, the
show going to Ben Eric. Bob Smith
started a new one in Palmdale, a colt
by George Kessler, which was backed
down to favoritism, but his showing did
not justify the plunge.
%Billy Magrane's old ready money ar
ticle, Matt Mogan, outflgured his field
in the six and a half furlong run* and
at 6 to 5 scored off by himself. Moco
rito pegged along in second position
and at the wire led Modder out a neck.
Better things were expected of David
S, but Powell was detained at some of
the sidings or way stations, arriving
late. Captivate stumbled to her knees
on the back stretch with P. Phillips
while making some progress.
"White Hat" McCarty claims he
has another Horton in the bay mare
Petrolia, and perhaps he has. At any
rate she has a habit of reaching the
wire first at remunerative odds, and
that is good enough. Col. Van and,
Montana Peeress were two such warm
ones for the mile and seventy-yard run
that little attention was devoted to
any of the other starters. Col. Van
closed favorite and less than a furlong
from the judges he apparently had the
race won. Then Vanderbout lost his
head, and it looked as if Phillips wo'uld
put the 10 to 1 shot Billy Moore over.
About this time, when within a few
gasps of the tape, Bonner got up with
Petrolia. beating Billy out a neck. Fif
teen to one could be had about the win
ner. Expedient looked to have a chance,
but probably the route was a trifle too
abbreviated for him. Montana Peeress
lookod a possibility to the stretch,
where she resigned her position.
Hainault at first had the call in the
speculating on the closing mile and
fifty-yard selling fixture, but later
gave way to Hoceo, which was backed
down to 16 > to 5 favoritism. The for
mer has had too much racing of late,
though cutting out the pace long
enough to kill off Hoceo. Illilouon, rid
den by Buxton, and Lacy Crawford
with Bonner in the saddle,. then fought
it out, trie former receiving the verdict
by a head. The winner closed at 5 to 1
in the ring. *S|
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
An improvement was perceptible in
Bonner's riding, the McCafferty Jockey
piloting two winners ; and \ thrice . fin
ishing inside the money.
Buxton also reached the wire with
a brace of winners.
James Hanley received a wire from
John Condon last evening,' in which
the blind' owner of; Harlem says there
is no change- in the Chicago racing
situation. He still opines that the
Worth track people will accept ,the
original dates allotted by the West
ern Jockey Club.
The stake and programme book of
the new Louisville Jockey Club shows
a splendid list of entries, and the
meeting this spring at Churchill
Downs should be, one of the most
successful in the: history of the asso-;
ciation.
The question of superiority between
Napa Stock Farm's great filly Arisbe
and Barney. Schreiber's black colt
Pinkerton still remains unsettled. In
the' stake race ; last Saturday Arisbe
was .unfortunate", in drawing a poor
position and getting away , badly.

"Well, dey ain't got a chance," said
the tough kid yesterday afternoon
when the ninth inniner at the Oakland
grounds was reached ancl Portland was
leading, 3 to 1. "I tell yer, its curtains
wid Pete and his tramps now. I'm
goin' to de big feed and read about
de finish to-morrer. Ta ta."
As the tough kid made, his getaway,
Streib was given a life on an error
by Thielmanâ the first that Portland
had committed during the game. Nor
had he been on the bag for a minute,
when Devereaux lined a hot one at
Castro. He fumbled it and the run
ner was safe, amid cheers from the
Oakland rooters.
Dr. Moskiman, instead of Buchanan
was called in to take a wallop at the
ball. Thielman got rattled at this
Juncture and walked the medical
tosser, filling up the bases. Ganley
approached the rubber with his club,
took his place, and, bing! He clouted
that ball out to left field for two bags
and tied up the score by bringing in
Streib and Devereaux. -
Then the Portland manager got
nervous and took Thielman out of the
box, although he had been pitching
championship ball and was not re
sponsible for the runs that kept
swarming in. The first ball that
Shields, the new twirler, pitched was
hit by Francks to Castro. The latter
had no glue on his glove, so he fum
bled the hot one and then threw wild
to first. Francks was safe and Mos
kiman came tearing in with the win
ning run.
It was a great game of ball from the
start and it looked like - a Portland
cinch for many innings. In the sec
ond, they landed on the offerings of
Buchanan for four hits, which pro
duced but one run. The Oaklanders
tied up this in the sixth on a two
bagger by Francks and singles by
Kruger and Dunleavy. Then Portland
forged ahead in the seventh, when they
made two rtins on clean hits and main
tained the lead till that skyrocket
finish which Peter Lohman and his
crew executed. The score:

Proves Portland's Undoing
With Bases Full, He Lines
Out a Two-Bagger, Which
Toward the end of the round they
held with one hand and with the free
hand swung wildly for head and body.
The bell stopped hostility at this
Woods was trying to hustle Schreck
.nbout in the twenty-fourth, but the
man from Chicago bravely stood his
ground. In the twenty-Hfth and last
round they went at it like a pair of
feather- weights just starting on an
exhibition bout. They fought all over
the ring, each trying to land any
kind of a blow.
A GREAT CLOSE
The twenty-second round was a
hard round. Woods went in viciously
aiid got a right and left to the head
that stopped hiÂ« gallop. They were
both trying hard for a decisive punch
at the end of the round. Schreck
kopt up his jabbing and ducking in
the twenty-third round.
The sixteenth was a fierce round,
the men struggling all over the ring.
Woods missed two left swings and got
a stiff right to the head. The seven
teenth was Schreck's round. His left
was shooting out with the regularity
of a piston rod and Woods seemed un
able to either block it or get out of
the way. Schreck kept up his tactics
in the eighteenth round. Woods
freshened up in the nineteenth and
scored some hard blows to the head
and body.
In the twelfth round Schreck kept
up his Jabbing and had Woods bleeding
badly from the noee. Schreck seemed
to be tiring from his exertions, but
he freshened up and had thÂ« best of
the elugglng match. Woods missed
many swings in this round and then
tried rough tactics with Schreck, who
stood his ground manfully.
Woods kept up big efforts in the
fourteenth to land one of his swings,
but Schreck'e head was never In the
way. The fifteenth was Woods'
round. He staggered Schreck early in
the round and then forced him about
the ring.
In the ninth round each was poking
about In an effort to draw the other's
fire. Woods staggered Schreck with a
left to the head, but he came back
fighting. Schreck commenced to im
prove In the eleventh round, scoring
often to the body and head.
Woods sent a left to the head at the
opening of the seventh round and took
one In return. Schreck shook him up
with a right and left to the head.
Schreck half slipped down near the
end of the round from a left to the
head.
Both men crouched considerably,
Hchreck's position being reminiscent of
Jeffries' attitude. Woods kept his left
thoulder high and many blowB intend
ed for his jaw Sanded there. Shreck
was the first to try when the men went
together in the opening round, sending
a right to the body. Woods came back
Kith a right as they broke away.
Woods sent a right and left to the head
*\nd followed with another left, which
started Schreck bleeding. Schreck sent
a left to the head and got another one
in return early in the second round.
S'-hrcck tried repeatpdly, but the blows
did not go past his guard.
Woods did most of the scoring in
the third round, although Schreck
kept up his Jabbing tactics. The fourth
v.as a bad round for Schreck. He got
a left to the head, which made his
knees hend under him, and he got a
vicious ]eft swing as he was getting
out of a -break. Woods staggered him
v.-Jth a left to the head near the end
of the round. Schreck tried several
times to land a back hander. but did
no damage.
Early in the fifth round Woods sent
x left to the body and got a left in
return. Schreck got through a left to
the jaw and in exchange landed a left
to the head. Woods missed one of his
favorite left hooks. Schreck had him
worried this early in the fight by the
light blows he was sending to his head.
Pchreck ducked under three hard
swings early in the sixth round. He
came back with a left to the body
and another left to the head. There
was a hot slugging match Just before
the end of the round. Each man tried
for a knockout. Schreck seemed on the
point of going out, but he came back
fighting on the ropes and In the strug
gle both men slipped down.
SO3IE HOT WORK.
When the grong sounded the end of
the battle the referee waved both arms
in the air, signaling a draw. The men
who had been betting: 2 to 1 on Woods
seemed relieved when the decision was
announced. The fig-lit was fast and
clean, there being but little clinching
and the men breaking quickly at the
quiet commands of the referee. Schreck
did most of the forcing, but In the
*>arly part of the figrht he found it diffi
cult to tret past 'Woods' gxiard.
THERE WAS CROUCHING.
Throughout the figfct Woods was try
ing to get an opportunity to land thÂ«;
decislre knockout punch. Schreck
ducked fully a hundred swings in
which was aU the strength of Woods'
powerful body. Had any one of thesfi
landed, the iron-jaw^d man would
surely have taken the count. In the
twenty-third round the spectators, who
were with Schreck from the start, com
menced yelling "Schreck, Schreck,
Schreck." Their cries seemed to amuse
rteferee Jack Welch, who smiled sar
castically, as much as to say, "You
might catch Eddie Graney with that
chaff, but you can't fool me." The
cries were continued after each round
until the end.
Referee Jack Welch in calling: It a
drmw <Jld so because Woods was the
stronger toward the end of the fight
and also because he did the most ef
fective hitting. Schreck tapped and
tapped, but there was no force in most
oi his blows.
Mike Sclxreek. the Iron-Jawed boxer
from Chicago, look some of the luster
from the reputation of BJlly Woods,
Â¦who was proclaimed the greatest mid
dle-weight In America. He boxed
tweuty-Ove rounds with the colored
bonder !act night at Colma and, on
mere boxing points, was probably en
titled to the decision.

quarrel over dates does not affect us."
paid Lawrence A. Young, president of
the Washington Park Jockey Club to
day. The sentiment among the West
ern Jockey Club leaders also was that
the prospects of a turf war coming
from the Worth Jockey Club sources
were slight and not to be feared. It
was believed by them and admitted
that the combination of the Western
Jockey Club and the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club formed an obstacle which
cut short all possible combination to
combat the local organization.
Worth's course was said to-day to be
Btill undecided, but officials of the
i rack declared positively that Worth
will not open on the dates assigned.
Turf War Is Not Expected.
Small In More Trouble.
William A. Small was booked at the
City Prison yesterday on a warrant
charging him with felony embezzle
ment issued by Police Judge Fritz.
The complaining witness is George A.
Rigg, assistant manager of the Howe
Scale Company, 12 Pine street, who
alleges that Small, while acting as
agent for the company for the sale
of typewriting machines in 1892, em
bezzled $265. The amount in the
complaint is $65, the price of one ma
chine.* Small is waiting his prelimin
ary hearing in Judge Fritz's court on
a charge of grand larceny for stealing
diamonds valued at $1000 from Miss
Josie Sinkie, 912 McAllister street. He
was arrested in New Orleans.
M rs. Docture Is Released.
Mrs. Helen Docture, a colored
woman, who called at police head
quarters on Monday, evening and said
she had shot a rival in the affections
of her husband in Cleveland, Ohio,
was released from custody yesterday
morning. Chief Wittman wired to
Chief Fred Kohler of Cleveland and
he replied yesterday morning that
Mrs. Docture was not wanted there.
District Attorney Byington has de
cided to retry William B. Kennedy,
alias Richard Jackson, alias "Yellow,"
for the murder of Policeman Eugene
C. Robinson at Sixteenth and Valen
cia streets on the morning of January
21, 1902. Kennedy was convicted of
murder in the second degree, but was
granted a new trial by the Supreme
Court on the ground that he could not
be convicted on the uncorroborated
testimony of an accomplice. He was
discharged by Judge Cook on Satur
day, as the District Attorney had no
further evidence at that time to offer.
Now it is said that new evidence will
be forthcoming. There is a charge of
attempt to commit burglary pending
aganst Kennedy in Police Judge
Fritz's court.
Kennedy to Be Retried.
Charles Steinberg was the creator of
the devastation. He had pursued Emil
Denlson, a ship carpenter, from the
Folsom-street saloon wherein their
quarrel began until the fugitive sought
refuge in Erben's place. As the hunted
man pantlngly rested his aching nether
limbs Steinberg dashed In, and with
a sigh Denison resumed running. In the
dining-room his Nemesis caught him,
picked him up, swung him around his
head twice or thrice to convey to the
helpless body a proper momentum and
then slammed It with terrific force upon
the table. The entire structure col
lapsed beneath the impact,- and Denl
son lay groaning amid a heap of splin
tered wood, broken crockery and glass
ware and ruined edibles.
Such was the tale narrated to Judge
Mogan, before whom Steinberg . stood
charged with assault and several other
offenses incidental thereto. To give the
defendant opportunity to make good
his declaration that Denison got no
more than was coming to him the case
was continued till to-day.

Mrs. Minnie Thompson was accom
panied bv her three neatly dressed
little children when she entered Mo
gan's court-to press the charge of as
sault which she had filed against her
husband, Charles L. t . a tea and cof
fee salesman residing at \ 23 Roscoe
street. The woman herself was attired
in well-fitting garments of inexpensive
George Jones, a young vagrant, was
unable to explain to the satisfaction
of Judge Mogan how he became pos
sessed of two ladies' purses, and six
months in the County Jail was prompt
ly prescribed for him.
Laura Martinez, who was born on
one of the spice Islands that stud the
Spanish Main, held her heart intact un
til she met Sergeant Lee Banks, a col
cred infantryman, and to him It . was
promptly and unconditionally surren
dered. At the time of the capitulation
Laura was one of the attractions of a
Pacific-street dancehouse, and when
the dashing soldier captured her heart
and hand she naturally presumed that
he would remove his bride to a place
more conducive to cloudless honey
mooning, but she fooled herself. Ser
geant Banks not only insisted that she
continue her terpsichorean exercises at
the old stand, but assaulted her when
she declined to give him all the money
she earned as a danseuse.
That's how the story was told, to
Judge Conlan, and at its conclusiop he
pronounced Sergeant Banks guilty of
battery and ordered him to appear to
day for sentence.
Maurice Knapp, a ladies* tailor, and
the husband of one of his customers
were before Judge Cabaniss on charges
of disturbing the peace, and after all
the evidence had been heard, the court
dismissed the case as one that could be
amicably settled without the aid of the
law's machinery.
It appeared that the tailor made a
$15 dress for the lady and that in pay
ment for It her husband offered $10
cash and a bill for $5 which he held
against the tailor's father-in-law, and
that thereupon the tailor waxed
mighty/ wroth and refused to accept
anything but full payment in money,
with the result that an altercation en
sued which led to the court proceed
ings.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Meyer denied that he conducted a
pool room, but the court disbelieved his
plea and ordered him to appear to-day
for sentence. Then it was suggested to
Cole that he might make a charge of
embezzlement stick against Meyer, and
Cole has the suggestion under advise
ment.
In addition to violating the ordi
nance which prohibits the selling of
pools on sporting events, an offense of
which he was convicted yesterday in
Conlan's court, W. J. Meyer stands ac
cused of "welching," and may be for
mally charged with embezzlement.
J. Cole, the complaining witness, tes
tified that after losing several invest
ments in the race handbook kept by
Meyer at his cigar store, 48 Fourth
street, he at last picked a horse named
Skip Me to win at Oakland, and Skip
Me did not disappoint him. The pre
vailing odds were 8 to 1, and Cole
backed his judgment with $5, thus win
ning $40. But when he went to collect
Meyer coolly informed him that no
such wager had been entered in his
book and firmly declined to give Cole
as much as one cent. Cole's statement
was corroborated by J. Horton, who
was present when the $5 was staked on
Skip Me and heard the terms of the
wager. Â»
A motion to dismiss the charge of
carrying concealed weapons was re
fused,, as was an application for a
transfer of the case to another de
partment on the ground that Judge Mo
gan had shown prejudice.
"The record shows no such preju
dice," was Judge Mogan's only com
ment. Then he advised the prosecut
ing attorney to supply the police au
thorities of Oakland with that portion
of the woman's testimony stating that
her husband had placed her in a dis
reputable house there and cqjlected her
earnings.
The hearing n*ill be resumed this
morning.
"This defendant," said the court, "Is
the most depraved and contemptible
wretch that has ever appeared before
me, and while he shall be treated fairly
within the law, he shall receive no con
cessions from this bench. His unfor
tunate wife Is entitled to .protection,
and I shall see to it that she is neither
coerced nor' cajoled into refusing to
prosecute him."
Then, turning to the bailiff, the Judge
requested him to Inform the city jailer
that the woman was not to be allowed
to hold any communication whatever
with the defendant.
In the case of the Johnsons, Michael
and Hattie, it developed yesterday that
since his incarceration on her com
plaint the young wife has visited the
middle-aged husband at the City Prison
and supplied him with creature com
fcrts; also that she neglected to ap
pear in Judge Mogan's court last Mon
day to prosecute, as she had been -in
structed to do, and that an attachment
for her person was issued to secure her
attendance yesterday.
For a while the unfortunate woman
testified reluctantly, but under direct
questioning by the Judge, and despite
the strenuous objections of the defend
ant's attorney, she gradually abandoned
whatever lenient intentions she may
have harbored and told her piteous
story freely. From the time when, as
a 16-year-old girl, she was ruined by
Johnson until his arrest last Friday
she had been his helpless slave, sup
porting him In idleness, under intimi
dation, by the earnings of her shame.
He it was who arranged the prelimi
naries of her admission to various im
moral houses in Portland, Los Angeles
and this city, and he it was who threat
ened to kill her if she ever appearefl
in court against him. During her re
cital Johnson stared fixedly in her face,
but she kept her eyes upon her kindly
interrogator and spolte fearlessly.
The attorney for the defense alluded
to his client as if he were a model citi
zen, and the allusion apparently ex
ploded the judicial indignation which
the woman's tale had kindled.

Then came Sherman Washburn, tall,
lean and dirty, who had been arrested
for peddling books at 4 o'clock yester
day morning in the vicinity of Bush
and Kearny streets. Patrolman Mc-
Grane offered In evidence a small bro
chure entitled "Washburn in Water,"
its four leaves being filled, with In
structions for novices in the art nata
torial. Mr. Washburn modestly con
fessed authorship of the work.
"Why don't you practice what you
preach?", queried the, Judge. ,
v What do you mean?" Inquired ; the
defendant.
"I mean that you look as if you had
not been in water since you were born."
"Oh, I am^ engaged in the construc
tion of another volume, to be entitled
'The Rain Cloud,' and telling how rain
may.be produced at will, and close ap
plication to my literary labor is re
sponsible for. these evidences of. per
sonal ' neglect," .- explained Mr. Wash
burn, gazing meditatively, at one of .his
bunches of soiled fingers.
"Well, Washburn out of water, we
have had all the rain we want In this
latitude for one . season," said the
Judge, "and I , hate to let you go to
complete that book; and fill the â city
with amateur cloud-crackers.- 7 But ,T
will let you go on condition, that you
Immediately, betake yourself and your
unfinished contribution to scientific lit
erature to the region 1 Bouth.of the Te
hachapj, where precipitation in -unlim
ited quantity Is ever yearned for."
Mr. Washburn promised to travel as
suggested.
Richard O'Brien gave his occupation
as "professional astrologer and phren
ologist" when he was booked for va
grancy, but he didn't look either part
as he stood before Judge Mogan.
"To me the firmament is an open
volume and the human cranial forma
tion an infallible Index to human char
acter," said the savant proudly as he
hitched up his tattered trousers with
one hand and buttoned his ragged
coat across a vestless chest with the
other.
"Does your astrological skill enable
you to foretell mundane events?" re
spectfully inquired the Judge.
"Aye, that it does."
. "Well, request the jailer to permit
you to consult the stars to-night so
that you may be. prepared to receive
what I will hand to you to-rhorrow."
The man of science bowed courte
ously and was withdrawn.
"Well, we'll wait for the cop, Mr.
Reed, and if your old friend's', skull is
fractured I may fall" to appreciate the
spirit of playfulness that prompted
you to fracture it."
" 'Twas all a josh, yeronner," he
said pleasantly. "An old friend of
mine came inter de saloon an' I just
guv him a clout on de head wid a
billiard cue. Dat wuz all. Nottin' to
it. All a josh."
"Is your old friend still alive?" In
quired the court.
"Guess so," replied Mr. Reed. "De
cop can tell youse all about dat."
Mr. Reed leaned a brawny arm
upon the bench and smiled blandly as
he complied with the judicial com
mand.
Patrolman Nelson failed to appear

"Tell us about it," said the Judge
to the defendant.
The Shong Kee housewarming night
before last eclipsed the most success
ful of its predecessors in all that went
to make social enjoyment. Among
those not present was Fong HIngr.
"Five dollars," said the Judge.
The great Shong Â¦ Kee event was
scheduled for last Monday evening,
and on the afternoon of that day Fong
Hing hied him to the laundry of Sam
Hop to obtain the precious shirt. Sam
Hop passed him a bundle tagged with
his name, but before tendering his
ticket Fong Hing insisted that the
shirt be shown him. Sam Hop was un
able to show it. The shirt was miss
ing. Fong Hinp cut up roughly. Sam
Hop and aids hurled him through a
window. Arrest of Fong Hing by Po
lice Sergeant Christensen and posse.
Charge, malicious mischief.
"State your defense," said Judge
Mogan to Sam Hop.
"Me no tlow him tloo window,"
said Sam Hop to Judge Mogan; "he
tlow himself tloo window."
For weeks Fong Hing, famed as the
Adonis of Chinatown, has been re
garding with anticipatory delight the
figure he would cut at the Shong Kee
annual reunion, one of the most im
portant social functions on the calen
dar of the Chinese haut ton. Fong
was determined to eclipse his best pre
vious effort in the line of captivat
ing the ladies and earning the envy of
his own sex, and with that end in
view he overhauled his wardrobe.
Among the garments that could be
made to pass critical Inspection, even
at the fastidious Shong Kee affair,
was one silken shirt, but it needed
â¢washing for the ordeal. So he took
it, with some other soiled clothing,
to the laundrv of Sam Hop, an old
college chum, at 837 Clay street, and
there left it, with particular directions
as to its treatment.
material, and both her appearance and
demeanor contributed to substantiate
the tale of unprovoked cruelty which
she told. She said that for several
years the man had treated her and his
offspring in a most inhuman way, and
the details which she furnished were
piteous. Thompson offered no defense,
and the Judge pronounced him guilty
and remanded him for sentence to
day..''
"And for your information I will
now state that vou will get the limit
for battery and non-support," said
tho Judge to the defendant,, who hung
his head and said nothing.*
"Judge, I wish you would give me
a divorce," said the little woman.
"Sorry I can't do that for you, mad
am," was the kindly response, "but
if my testimony aids you to get a di
vorce in the proper court I shall be
glad to furnish it."

Norris stated that the trust dictated
in one instance the size of paper a
newspaper should use, thereby pre
scribing-the kind of press that should
be operated.
WASHINGTON, April 5.-7The reso
lution of Representative Lilly instruct
ing the Secretary oi\Commerce and
Labor to Investigate the high price
and scarcity of news print paper and
the causes which have produced these
conditions was the subject of discus
sion to-day before the House Com
mittee on Judiciary. Don C. Seitz of
the New York World and John Xor
ris, business manager of the New York
Times, were heard. Both covered prac
tically the same ground in statements
that the International Paper Company
and the General Paper Company had
divided the United States between
them in the control of the news print
paper. The International controlled
all that section east of the Indiana line
and the General Company the terri
tory west of that line. â This combina
tion, it was testified, had raised the
price of news paper during the last
four years $14 a ton and during the
past year as much as $5 a ton; it was
selling paper in London, counting the
freight and insurance, at 30 per cent
less than it did in New York.
Seitz declared that when the paper
trust was formed it took nearly all the
independent mills at prices not war
ranted by the condition of the prop
erty. It had $55,000,000 invested in
plants not worth over $25,000,000 and
was charging prices for paper to pay
dividends on the larger amount. -

Five apprentice* on the British ship Falls of
Halladalp, lying: at Union-street wharf, had a
narrow escape yÂ«>terday from being crushed
to death. They were on a staging suspended
over the ship's side engaged in chipping rust
from the plates near the water line. The gaso-'
line bchooner Expansion was testing the driv
ing power of a new engine. As she neared
the Hailadale her steering gear got out of. or
der. -The >nglnÂ«-*wa3 stopped, but the heavy
schooner had considerable headway and was
making a course which would throw her
against the Halladale's side, about tbe place
where the five men worked on the staging.
Warnings were shouted in all directions, and
when the crash came the five sailor boys were
chinning for their lives up the slings in which
the staging hung. With all their activity,
however, some of them would have been killed
but for a slight changing oX the Expansion's
course, which caused her to veer away from
the Hailadale while there was still a space of
a foot between the schooner's wooden guard
and the ship's eteel side.
Sailors Un,vc Narrow Escape.
If the wreck of the Rio de Janeiro Is where
the latest alleged discoverers claim. It Is safe
from all the efforts of treasure hunters. Ac
cording: to Captain Whitelaw, who was taken
out yesterday to where the liner's bones are
wild to be resting, the wreck la lying in twen
ty-one fathoms of water. This is just about
two score feet too deep for salving operations,
even if the water were still and abovo what Is
claimed to be the Rio's grave, the tide races
like a runaway colt and never rests.
The most valuable part of the Rio's cargo
was a shipment of raw Silk. If recovered and
properly and promptly treated, experts say this
silk would still have rome value. The liner
alwo carried a large shipment of block tin.
Except for such change as might be in the
purser's safe. Rhc had no gold. The total value
of her carto was estimated at $800,000.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
WASHINGTON. April 5.â The labor
troubles on the Isthmus of Panama,
growing out of the strike of the em
ployes of the Panama Railroad Com
pany, have taken a serious turn, and
the facts have been reported to the
State Department by the United States
Charge at Panama. The matter was
deemed of sufficient importance to war
rant consideration at length at the Cab
inet meeting to-day, and the unani
mous opinion was that everything pos
sible'should be done to avoid an entan
glement of the United States Govern
ment in any labor controversy. But it
also was determined that the Govern
ment would not withhold in any degree
the protection to the Panama Railroad
which It had assumed by treaty, and it
was directed that the railroad proerty,
rolling stock, track and terminals
should be protected by forces from the
United States warships at the isthmus,
if that became necessary.
No compulsion will be exercised
against the strikers to compel them to
return to work. If the railroad man
agement can secure a sufficient force oC
men to operate the road they will be
upheld In such an attempt. This will
be done with the full consent of the
Panama Government, though under
broad treaty provisions this is not ab
solutely necessary.
Secretary Moody was charged with
the duty of carrying out this decision,
and with instructing Admirals Glass
and Sigsbeo as <o the course they shall
pursue.
There is ample force on the isthmus
for any emergency. .
The Egyptian agreement does not af
fect Great Britain's protectorate over
Egypt, being confined to the adminis
tration of the Egyptian debt. Great
Britain having a larger latitude in dis
posing of the surplus without the con
currence of France. France gets, im
proved facilities in reaching Lake
Tchad and other points in French Cen
tral Africa. This concession is a par
tial return for the surrender of her
sovereignty over the Newfoundland
shore.
The indications are that the treaty
will go strengthen the French position
that her North African empire will
eventually stretch westward to the At
lantic.
The main points are settled, but there
are some details capable of causing
delay. For instance, the Newfoundland
Government does not wish the French
fishermen to retain the right of
catching their own bait off shore.
However, this is considered a minor
detail and not likely to affect the gen
eral agreement. France surrenders her
sovereignty over the Newfoundland
shore, and receives an indemnity. The
latter is twofold â '
First, for French individuals giving
up property along the surrendered
shore, and,
Second, for the French Government'*
relinquishment of its sovereignty.
The reports current setting .forth the
amount of the indemnity are Inac
curate, as it is the present intention
to submit the amount of the indem
nity to The Hague tribunal.
Morocco will figure In the treaty,
and, according to the French view, will
be the most Important subject.
PARIS. April 5.â Foreign Minister
Delcasse had a long conference to-day
with Paul Cambon, French Embassa
dor at London,, relative to the Anglo-
French colonial treaty, settling several
long-pending issues, principally In re
gard to Morocco, Egypt and New
foundland. Cambon will return to
London to-morrow, and it Is the ex
pectation that the treaty -will be sign
ed toward the end of the present week.

The Union Lumber Company has
chartered the bark Vidette and the
barge (formerly the bark) Tidal Wave
and will put both Into commission car
rying lumber between Fort Bragg and
this port. They will be towed both
ways. Other mills are making similar
arrangements and the local market will
soon again be receiving its regular sup
ply of lumber from the northern coast
The trouble between the steam
schooner owners and their employes
seems to be further from prospect .of
settlement than ever, and in view of
the withdrawal of the steamers from
the coast trade for an indefinite period
the lumber people are making other
arrangements to get the product of
their mills to market. The plan in
course of. adoption promises active em
ployment for many otherwise idle sail
ing vessels and will keep the available
sea, going towboats working at high
pressure.
The Fort Bragg Lumber Company
was the pioneer in the effort to get
along without the steam schooner. It
chartered the schooners Falcon and Jo
seph Russ and the \ tug Sea Rover
and has kept the little fleet on the
move since putting its plan into ope
ration. The Rover towed the Falcon
and Rusff to Fort Bragg. While the
company was loading them the tug re
turned and took the schooner Bella
from here to Caspar. From there the
Rover went to Fort Bragg and took in
tow the loaded. Joseph Russ, arriving
here with her yesterday. The Russ had
on board 276.00Q feet of lumber. The
Falcon, with 270,000 feet of lumber on
board, arrived here Monday, having
sailed down. Taking the liuss to her
berth, the Sea Rover passed a hawser
to the schooner Sailor Boy and left
with her yesterday afternoon for Cas
par.

Longworth Strawberries wrre offering again.
Thrre drawers of six small baskets each. came
in from Pals Alto . and sold at $1 25 per
drawer.
Trade in the Orange market continued ac
tive, but supplies were ample for all require
ments and prices were without quotable
variance. The large sizes of Navels, that is,
80s. 90s and 112s, jwere dull and .offered at
liberal concessions by some dealers, while the
small sizes met with a steady " inquiry and
cloie clearances of such fruit, particularly of
the standard grade, were effected at previous
prices. Mexican Limes were more active at
the recently reduced quotations, but stocks
were still txcesslve. Grape Fruit. Lemons and
Tangerines were in good request at unchanged

Butter developed more easiness yesterday
and In view of the heavy stocks dealers were
Inclined to shade quotations to keep their floors
clear. There were some sales of fine creamery
at l&c, but most of the trade still quoted 20c.
The Cheese market showed no change one way
or the other, being still overstocked and dÂ«
moraltxed, not only in this market, but up and
down the coast as well.
There was not much variation In Eggs. Re
ceipts were liberal and several receivers were
obliged- to do some storing to relieve their
floor*. Eastern Eggs have already begun to
roll this way. and at least one house reported
some en route. They -will go into store on
arrival. There Is no particular excitement in
the market at the moment and the whole trade
seem â¢ to be pretty well agreed upon quota
tions. Fomethtng that, does not often occur at
this time- of the year. Â¦ . .- Â¦ Â¦

NEW YORK. April .Vâ The perturbation ,Â».
fletted jvfterJay in the Btock market on ac
count of the Union Pacific's legal fight to re
tain im former holding of Northern Pacific
in the dissolution of the Northern Securities
Company had largely subsided to-day. The
n-sult was a siwcuiative movement of more
breadth and inert general Indication of In
terest than for a Ions time. That the oper
ations w.-r e largely thote of professionals j n
noUos nj sofaclently Indicated by the me
tl.odical manaer in which they were con
ducted. Kirst one and then another stix.-k
or group of stocks wag taken in hand and aj
vÂ»ncÂ«?d to a hichcr level or prices while 8*11
inti to t*-aliz<? the i>roflt on the advance Â»u
successfully conducted in the every act ..f
BMlilJja to tiuying in another jtroup. The
tyinpa>etie effect of a rise in one depart
nitnt u;wn the whole market Is cnÂ« of the
j most ofcv.-ous phenomena in the dealings in
j an open exchange. Tbie system of operation
Â¦ vas cirricd through nearly all the principal
I groups in the market to-day. The spread of
tho demand for stocks was no more ton
*I icuous.^ however, than the successive rtac
t;or.s which followed the transfer of opeta
t!cns to new quarter?. The marktt was vastly
improvtc in tone and in the distribution of
the dealings for all that. There was
les.s diFpositioh to attribute the unfound
e4 buying of Union Pacific to a competition
tor t-or.trol, oDinl^n leaning rather to an ec
cun ulation by powerful capitalists moved
r.iore by investment considerations. Union
Pacific was aloof from the day's upw&rl
movement, but it had no appearance of belm
in free enpply or being for sale. United
Plates t>tee! areferred also railed to share
fully in the <lny'a ptrength. The knowledge
tl;at nothing would b<? announced until aftirr
tbÂ« close regarding the preferred dividend and
Hie quarter's earnings discouraged the trading
in the ptock. It was cenTJilly assumed, how
ever, that the full dividend would be declared
en th-? prrferred. There was an erroneous
â¢ bsorplirin of the p^cond mortgage bonds on
a. strongly rising market. The day's nÂ«Â»s
dii not sec-m to play much part in the gen
eral moiement. Iieports of rain In the South
west may have induced buying of the grain
carriers in that section. Tlie reports of rail
r. ad earnings for the fourth week In March
which cahv to hand were distinctly belt< r
than tb* recent average and especially in the
Southern sections. Prices of copper ro;>e
stronKly both here and abroad and the strong
FiatiEtic-al position in the trade is much dwelt
upon. The local tractions as a group moved
upward without news.
Sterling exchange moved quite decisively
away from the point of profit on the triangular
export cold operation both here and In Paii*
The market closed Irregular and with the
effects of realising quite evident.

Mrs. George Law Smith presided â
and *ith what a manifestation of pa
tience! No amount of chatter calls
forth from the chair more than a look
of reproval. and the tap, tap of the
little wooden hammer.
" Before the real action of the after
noon began, reports from the depart
ment leaders were heard â and ladies,
congratulations for the brevity, pith
and conciseness of the information
given. As a rule â lest one be directly
interested in the particular department
under discussion â the reports of de
partment* are rather dull.
But yesterday vital interest was
manifested in ail three recapitulations
of work â Mrs. J. W. Orr reporting for
the Educational Department as its
chairman, Mrs. Jacob Brandt for the
Social Science Department and .Mrs.
F. W. Bradley for the Civics.
Mrs. Orr, working along the lines of
decoration for the home, announced
the completion of the work of decorat
ing the assembly hall in Franklin
Grammar School, wherein a reception
will be held on the 15th, when the girls
of the cooking classes will serve re
freshments for visiting friends.
The work was done through the
co-operation of the Board of Ed
ucation and the Franklin school,
likewise its principal, Mr. Faulk
ner; bnt the collecting of mon
eys was mostly due to the enter
gleg . of Mrs. Orr's department of the
club. And thus is demonstrated the
fast that not only the school board,
the children, and even their par
ents, can be aroused to the value of
domestic art: and it is this fact pri
marily that the club seeks to develop â

Druskin is detained in "the tanks"
pending an investigation. He says he
is 19 years of age, that he belongs to
San Jose and" is a son of Julius Drus
kin, a junk dealer there. He told De
tectives Dlnan and Wren that he had
been seeing a friend home, but he re
fused to give his friend's name or ad
dress, or to say where he had been liv
ing. Two men who have been held up
recently in the Western Addition will
be asked "to call at the prison to see if
they can identify Druskin.
Detectives Wren and Dinan searched
Druskin's room last night. They found
a large eight-ounce boitie of distilled
chloroform, ' a bicycle and a shotgun.
When Druskin was searched the offi
cers found two loaded revolvers, a box
of cartridges, a slung shot, a false
black mustache, ?32Â»in coin and a dia
mond ring. ' What gives color to the
suspicion that Druskin is a footpad is
the possession of the black mustache,
more than anything else, as the de
scription with mustache answers that
given by a man who was robbed fn
Jefferson square a few nights ago.
By this time Wafd was only -a few
yards behind Druskin, and 'when Drus
kin'saw him he started to run. Ward
took up the chase, and, after running
four blocks, Druskin was met by Po
licemen Ottson and Casey, who seized
him. * ., -v.V -
The police believe that In George
Druskin, who was arrested at an early
hour yesterday morning at Van Ness
avenue and Grove street by Policemen
Ottson, -"Casey and Ward, they have the
man who has been holding up people in
the Western Addition.
Policeman Ward observed Druskin
following M. C. Nelson of 408 Fulton
street, who was on his way < home. A3
Druskin's actions were suspicious,
Ward started after him. Druskin was
rapidly gaining on Nelson when Nelson
reached his residence and quickly
opening the front door closed it almost
in Druskin's face.
He was given permission to interro
gate the jurors, and one of them, Ru
dolph Mohr, admitted that Dempsey's
plea of guilty had prejudiced him
against the rest of the gang. Judge
de Haven excused Juror Mohr from the
further consideration of the case, but
as the panel had been already excused
for the day Mr. Mohr's place could not
be filled and the trial went over until
11 a. m. to-day.
At the beginning of the trial on the
second indictment counsel for the de
fendants raised the contention that the
defendants Dasha and Dempsey having
been convicted of conspiracy could not
be placed again upon trial, because
whatever was done by them .with re
spect to Horn Toon, Wong Din and Lee
Lin was in pursuance of the one con
spiracy of which they had been con
victed.
Judge de Haven remarked that the
point was one for serious considera
tion, but that he would not, at that
time, grant the motion to dismiss. He
added. that the point could be made
just as well after conviction as before.
.lUDGK i>E HAVEN'S CHARGE.
The court, in charging the jury in
the ; morning in the trial of Dasha,
Dempsey and Horn Toon, said that
conspiracy might be proved by circum
stantial evidence. The trial was not,
he added, for illegally landing Chi
nese, buft^for conspiring to do so; and
that should it be proved in this case
that the defendants had illegally land
ed Chinese that would not prove them
guilty of conspiracy unless conspir
acy were also _ proved. The illegal
landing of Chinese, was an offense for
which the defendants could be punish
ed, but the indictment under which
they were being tried did not charge
that offense.
With reference to the . remarks of
defendant's counsel concerning the
testimony of Thomas T. " Burnett, the
court said that his testimony should
be weighed and considered with the
same care and in the. same manner
as that of any other witness in the
case.
Dempsey seemed to take the verdict
MOHR WAS- PKE.FUDICED.
In the United States District Court
yesterday, after deliberating for just
twelve minutes, the jury, convicted
William F. Dasha'. T. J. Dempsey and
Horn Toon of the crime of conspiring to
land Chinese in the United States ille
gally. The defendants were ordered to
appear for sentence to-morrow morn
ing at 11 o'clock without being required
to deposit any bail in addition to their
present bonds of J3000 each.
At 2 o'clock 'in the afternoon Thomas
T. Burnett was .granted a severance
and separate trial on the second indict
ment, which, charges W. . F. Dasha,
Thomas J. Dempsey, T. T. Burnett and
Wong Din with conspiring to land Chi
nese, illegally in the United States.
After the jury had been' impaneled; the
defendant Dempsey withdrew his pica
of not guilty and pleaded guilty. There
upon T. C. West, attorney for Wong
Din, remarked that the" action of one
of the defendants in pleading ' guilty
might have prejudiced the jury against
thy remaining defendants.
