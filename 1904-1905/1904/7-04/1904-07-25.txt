TOKIO, July 24, 6 p. m.â The Rus
sian Vladivostok squadron has . sunk
trie merchantman which it captured off
the coast of Izu province to-day. The
name of this ship and her nationality
are not known, and nothing has been
learned as to the fate of her crew.
Witnesses on shore saw the \ mer
chantman following the fleet, j Then
they saw her fired upon, after 'which
she disappeared.
The Russian warships were last re
ported at 11 o'clock this morning to the
southwest of Cape Iro, Izu province,
steering to the westward. .
Cape Iro is about sixty-five miles
southwest of Yokohama' and about fifty
miles from the entrance to the bay
upon which Yokohama and Toklo are
located.
When the Vladivostok, ships were
first seen- it was ' believed they '. were
going to capture the Pacific ; Mall
steamship Korea,- from San Francisco
for Yokohama, with "foodstuffs and ma

The Korea left San Francisco on July
12 and it has been feared that .she
would fall in with the ' Vladivostok
squadron. However, she was not due
off the Japanese Coast for three or four
days and it-Is doubtful if the Russians
would sink her. Her. capture would be
more Hkely. She has a valuable cargo.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
"I got clear of the ground all right
and then the wind struck the balloon.
The next thing I knew ,1 was In the
wires. I felt that if I was dragged over
the-wires It would.be all off with me,
so I let go of the bar and caught a
wire. It seemed as if I hung there for
an hour and then my hands began to
hurt. I tried to get a fresh grip and
that was thftlast.I knew." '
After Corkery fell the wires swung
together and two of them were burned
apart. .The'endsfell to the ground and
caused a display of electrical fireworks
until they were repaired.
-Corkery. resides at 807 Grove street.
When seen to-night the aeronaut was
so. unstrung- that he could not give a
very complete account of the accident.
He said, however:
. The accident occurred at 6 o'clock
this evening and was witnessed by a
thousand horrified 'people, not one of
whom was able to give any aid to the
imperiled aeronaut. Several men ran
for ladders and ropes, but before either
could be procured Corkery had fallen.
Corkery is the regular aeronaut at
the park and was making the balloon
ascension which closes, the Sunday
afternoon programme. After the bal
loon had been inflated Corkery pre
pared to ascend and gave the signal to
let go. He cleared the ground safely,
but as soon as the big bag rose above
the shelter of the trees it was struck
by the wind, which was blowing hard,
and instead of .rising higher was car
ried in an almost horizontal direction
toward. Telegraph avenue.. A moment
later the parachute was swung against
the electric light wires. \
DESPERATE FIGHT FOR LIFE.
Corkery realized at once that unless
h? let go he would be drawn across the
wires. Reaching up with one hand he
caught hold of a wire and then let go
his hold on the bar attached to the
balloon. The jerk of the balloon as It
was released nearly threw him to the
ground, but he held on and managed
to get a hold with his ether hand. This
was all that he t:ould do arid there he
hung, facing certain death if he tried
to draw himself up. and probably fatal
injury should he let go.
As the wire began to cut into his
hands, however, he made a struggle
to get a better hold. In doing so he
struck another wire with the back of
his neck. Instantly there was a flash
and the aeronaut fell. When picked
up he was unconscious and It was at
first thought that he was dead, but
after being carried Into the park he re
gained consciousness, and was taken
home.. .
part of the current. This was suffi
ciently, strong to rob him of his senses
and loosen his hold on the wire before

The question as to the efficiency of
the French navy under the manage
ment of M. Pelletan has reached an
acute stage In the French Parliament.
At a recent meeting of the extra Par
liamentary Commission of Inquiry into
the administration, of the Naval De
partment M. Lockroy, former. Minister
of Marine, stated that the Mediterra
nean squadron, which in 1899 was com.
posed of thirty-six ships, had now only
twenty-three. The. condition of the
The British armored cruiser Mon
niouth, 9800 tons, 22.000 horsepower, and
designed for twenty-three knots trial
speed, Is the last of the nine cruisers
of. the Kent class to be completed.
She has been in commission about
three months and arrived at Devon
port July 7 from Gibraltar, having
made the trip of 1200 miles in fifty
three and one-half hours. This Is an
average 'of 22.43 knots an hour, a sus
tained sea speed much higher than
her designers hoped for, and nearly up
to the trial run of eight "hours than
the ship averaged 22.58 knots with
2C.1S9 horsepower. "The hull and ma
chinery were built by the London and
Olaagow Shipbuilding Company. Glas
gow, and the boilers are of the Belle
ville type.
SPEED OF THE MOXMOUTII.
The dimensions and other principal
data of the three scout cruisers to be
built for the United StateB navy have
been decided. They are to be 420 feet
in length, 47 feet beam and displacing
4000 tons on 17.5 feet draught with a
fuli load of 1000 tons of coal, sufficient
for a steaming radius of 5000 miles.
These vessels will be marked improve
ments on the British scouts of the Ad
venture and Sentinel clqss, of which
eight are being built. . On a full load
displacement, varying from 3015 to 3320
tons, they carry only 380 to 470 tons of
coal. Their horsepower under full
speed of twenty-five knots is calculated
at 16,000, at which thirteen tons of coal
would be required for one hour's run,
and this would exhaust the supply of
470 tons in about thirty-six hours. The
American. scouts, carrying 1000 tons of
coal and assuming a horsepower of
20,000 would have sufficient fuel for
sixty-two hours at a gait of twenty
five knots an hoiir.
The trophies for excellence in gun
nery are of bronze and the designs ex
ecuted in low relief. The trophy won
by the Oregon represents a battleship
in an ordinary sea, steaming with a
bone in her teeth, and she is firing
from an after gun of her starboard
secondary battery.: Another battleship
is on her port boiv. The trophy won
by the Paul Jones represents a tor
pedo-boat destroyer steaming along in
a heavy sea. These trophies will be
located in a conspicuous place on
board the respective vessels and re
main in their possession until the first
following annual record target prac
tice, when the trophy may go to some
other ship having a higher percentage
of efficiency.
highest number of hits made by any
13-inch gun of the Oregon was five, '
while the Wisconsin's best score was
nine hits. The value of the Oregon's
firing with 13-inch guns is therefore de- i
termined by multiplying all the hits she
made by 100 and dividing the result by
five, the best score of the best pointer. !
The Winconsin's final result is arrived '
at by the same process, the divisor
the latter case being nine. In a sim- '
ilar manner all other guns of whatever
caliber are compared with each other,
but In no case are guns of different
bore or types thus compared. Every
officer and man therefore realizes that
no matter what the type of gun he
has to fire they may by excellent work
win the trophy of their class.
AMERICAN CRUISER NOW AT
BREMERTON AFTER LONG SER
VICE IN THE PHILIPPINES.
The British Admiralty has under con
sideration the o.uestion of motor tor
pedo-boats, and may create a class of
these small crafts for the riavy. An
experiment will be made with a boat
130 feet in length, with motors below
the water line, to be fitted with a deck
torpedo tube which can be pointed in
any direction. As torpedo picket boats
these craft would be invaluable in night
attacks, as the absence of smoke and
funnels would make them almost Invis
ible to an enemy. On the other hand,
the serious objection to motors for war
purposes is the highly Inflammable na
ture of the fuel, for if a shell struck a
tank of gasoline or petroleum it would
mean the instantaneous destruction of
the craft.
The number of British naval officers
studying foreign languages abroad has
been increased to twenty, and special
inducements are offered by the Admir
alty. The officers are allowed full pay,
and particular attention is to be direct
ed to the study of 'German, Russian
and Japanese languages, and in. regard
to the latter a Japanese teacher has
been attached to the Weihaiwei station.
northern squadron was such as to ren
der any combat impossible, as half the
ships were unfit for sea service, and
only one destroyer had been added to
the squadron during the last five years.
A vote was taken on the proposition to
deal exclusively with the charges
against M.'. Pelletan, and as this vote
was not carried the minority threatened
to resign. In order to avoid a scandal
M. Clemenceau, the president, managed
to effect a compromise by setting a fur
ther hearing a few days later. All tho
former Ministers of Marine and a large
majority of the higher grade naval of
ficers are decidedly antagonistic to M.
Pelletan.
The above flsrures of final merit of
ships do not. of course, represent pos
sible hits, but (simply the relative ef
ficiency of the various ehips and squad
rons. In calculating the final merit the
efficiency of old and modern Runs is
considered and nhipu having ordnance
that differs areatly from that of other
vessels in efficiency may, nevertheless,
compete with equal chances of attain
ing the highest final merit. Thus, tak
ing the Oregon and Wisconsin as ex
amples, it Is conceded that the latter
is the better fighting machine, having
the advantage of six years' improve
ments over the Oresron: but as each
pointer in the service fires durlnsr"ex-
HCtlvrthe same length of time, his srn re
is -the number. orhita he makes. The
The record of the target practice
scores made by sixty-four vessels of
the United States navy has been tab
ulated and shows some interesting re
sults. The vessels are classified under
three groups; the first composed of
ships firing guns of 5-inch caliber or
above; the second. of 4-inch or less, and
the 'third of torpedo vessels. Of the
eight squadrons, numbering thirty-five
in all, the North Atlantic fleet of seven
battleships made an average of 87.2 per
cent; the Asiatic fleet of three battle
ships and two monitors (the latter
counted as one ship) scored 82.84 per
cent, and the other squadrons ranjred
from 78.64 to 61.06 per cent meritB.
Class II, consisting of twenty-one ves
sels, scored from 77.26 to 32.82 per cent
in the ftve subdivisions and the eight
torpedo craft In three divisions gave
87.57 to 32.63 per cent.. Of Individual
ships the Oregon, as usual, comes to
the front with a final merit score of
111.47 per cent; the Wisconsin a good
second with 104.47 and the other nine
battleships ranging from 102.13 for the
Illinois to 69.72 credited to the Kear
sarge. Of the fifteen cruisers the New
York led with 96.37 per cent and the
Baltimore scored only 36.49 per cent.
The Paul Jones in the torpedo craft
class got 121.54 meritB, and the Stewart
obtained only 5.40 per cent. The trophy
vessels were the Oregon, dispatch-boat
Dolphin with 105.72 merits and the gun
boat Sarmar, which scored 93.07 per
cent.
The protected cruiser Albany, which
recently arrived at Bremerton for re
pairs and general overhauling, has
been in commission, attached to the
Asiatic station, since June, 1900, and
has made a good record. This ship,
then named Abreu, was purchased
March 16, 1898, from the Brazilian
Government for $1,205,000. The ves
sel was still on the- stocks at the Arm
strong yard, Elswick, and was not
launched until January 14, 1899. She
was commissioned May 29 of the fol
lowing year and proceeded to the
Philippines, where she remained until
about a month ago. He.r total cost,
rea.y ior service, was $1,207,644 13
and the repairs up to July 1, 1903,
have only amounted to $38,422 04,
which is within $luuO of the sum ex
pended for repairs to the New Or
leans, a sister ship, also purchased
from Brazil in 1898. These vessels are
of 3763 tons displacement, 7500 horse
power and twenty knots speed. They
are wood sheathed and coppered and
have 4 therefore been able to maintain a
higher speed on less coal consumption,
without being compelled to dock fre
quently. The New Orleans was ready
for service, when purchased for
$1,429,215 54, but after the war $124,
248 was expended in alterations and
additions to fit her for service in
northern waters. This- expense was
not required on the Albany, which was
designed for service in the tropics.
The launching of the battleship Con
necticut, building at the New York
Navy Yard, has been set for Septem
ber 29, at which time she will be about
one-half completed. The keel was laid
March 10, 1903, and the vessel had
advanced to 44.82 per cent toward
completion on July l, against the
Louisiana, 50.79 per cent, building at
Newport News. The Connecticut gain
ed 1 per cent on the Louisiana during
June. The latter will probably be
launched in October, and the Ne
braska, building at Seattle, is also ex
pected to run off the ways during the
beginning of October.

NEW YORK, July 24.â John P. Hol
land, inventor of the submarine' boat
which bears his name, is at work upon
a new navy destroyer which he= be
lieves will be, when completed, an en
gine of war against which no warship
will be able to stand. He has been
considering the plans several years, but
they, probably will not be carried to
completion until he has mastered the
flying machine problem, which lately
has 'engrossed his attention.
Holland has severed his connection
with the Electric Boat Manufacturing
Company which built the Holland
boats. His contract with the com
pany expired last April. He had al
ready withdrawn as an officer and di
rectof, although he still retained a few
shares of stock. These he sdld a few
days ago in this city.
Holland complained that the com
pany changed the plans of his boats
against his will and gave him only
1% per cent of $1,000,000 capital stock as
his interest in the concern for his boats
and plans. To-day the inventor said
that it may be months before his new
submarine boat is ready for service,
but he would divulge none of the de
tails of the work. His whole time is
taken up with experiments.

The admiral is the only Englishman
who can boast of having the freedom of
New York conferred upon him since
revolutionary days. This honor fol
lowed what is known as the Virginiuj
incident, when an American filibuster,
the Virginius, was. captured by the
Spanish and ' taken to the har
bor of Santiago de Cuba. The
Spaniards were engaged in a whole
sale execution of the English and
Americans aboard when Sir Lambton
entered the port in command of the
warship Nile and ( threatened to blow
every vessel out of the harbor if any
more were killed. The butchery was
suspended, and for this Sir Lambton,
who is the head of one of the oldest
houses in England, his baronetcy dat
ing from Kins Charles I, received the
freedom of New York and a pure gold
brick from Montana miners.

It If not known in Esopus what an
swer Judge Parker made to tUe letter,
but it is understood that thus far he
has accepted no dinner engagement of
a political character.
ESOPUS, July 24. â In contradiction
of the story that no overtures have
been made to Judge Parker with a
view of bringing about closer rela
tions between the candidate for Presi
dent and Tammany, it was learned
here to-day that Edward Rupallo of
New York wrote to the Judge on
July 12 inviting him to take dinner
with Tammany Hall men at the New-
York Ityemocratic Club. Rapallo re
ported to Judge Parker that he had
been commissioned by Charles F. Mur
phy and Mayor McClellan to tender
the invitation.

TAMMAXV MARKS OVERTURES.
In 1S97 Parker was elected Chief
Judge, and in January. 189S, Clearwater
was appointed to the Supreme Court
vacancy. In the fall of the same year
Ckarvratrr was defeated for the Su
preme Court bench in the district. He
has always carried Ulster County in
every contest he has engaged in at
the polls.
The paths of Judge Parker and Judge
Clearwater have run parallel for many
years. They studied law together and
have occupied pews in the Frst Dutch
Church. In 1877 Parker was elected
Surrogate and Clearwater District
Attorney and in 1SS3 both were re
elected. In 1SS5 Parker was elected
Supreme Judge; in 1S89 Clearwater was
elected County Judge and re-elected
in 1SP5.
in Vicinity of Ksopus,
ESOPUS, July 24.â It is the purpose
of the Republicans of Ulster county
living in Kingston. Esopus and sur
rounding villages to make Judsre
Parker's home county one of the prin
cipal righting grounds in the New York
State campaign. To offset the effect
cf having an Ulster county Democrat
at tne h-.-ad c-f the national Democratic
ticket, the New York Republican
leaders will be asked to look kindly
upon the plan to name Judge A. T.
Clearvvater of Kingston as the Repub-
Kcan candidate to succeed Judge Mar
t n on the Court of Appeals. Judge
I.artin will retire under the age limit
ard his successor will be named this
fixil. Judge Clearwater enjoys great
'Â¦ cal popularity and the Republicans
Â«-f Kingston and vicinity argue that if
tre county Is to be kept from the Dem
ocratic column it must be accomplished
by placing on the ticket the name of
?-ii Ulster Countv man.
Republicans Will U'ase Heavy War
TO FIGHT PARKER AT HOME.
What gave Judpe Parker greater sat
isfactan than he derived from the in
\itation was the assurance that the dif-
I't i -fin Â«.s between the opposing factions
in the Illinois Democracy would be en
tirely settled and that the party in that
State Hould present a solid front for
the national ticket. It was stated in the.
convci nation between Judgre Parker and
the Illinois delegation that the ill feel
ing tngendoied as the result of the con
tests between delegations seeking seats
in the St. Louis convention would be
eliminated absolutely. This informa
tion, coming from representatives of
Mayor Harrison, proved reassuring to
Judge Parker, inasmuch as it is taken
to mean th^ healinpr over of the dispute
between Mayor Harrison ar.d John P.
Hopkirs. who in all probability will
have charge of the campaign in Illinois.
ESOPUS. N. Y.. July 24.â Judge Alton
LJ. Parker. Democratic candidate for
PresiCtnt. did not accept nor did he de
tJine an invitation presented to him to
day to sr>tak at a Democratic ratifica
tion tnectins to be hold in Chicago on
August 20. when William J. Bryan will
be one of the p;>eakeis. A delegation
representing Mayor Carter H. Harrl
an vis-ited him at Esonus to-day.
Judge Parker told E. M. LahilT. who
artÂ»-<l as Fnoktpman, that to accept the
Invitation at this time might cause him
surnc- embarrassment, and he did not
ftt'l like- promising to- attend any event
ot that character, at least until after
the notification ceremonies had taken
llii.ee. He did czy. however, that If he
acieptvd any invitations at all he would
visit Chicago.

LONDON, July 25.â The statement
that Russia has decided to waive her
claim to search the Malacca and to
forbid similar seizures in the future is
accepted by the morning papers as a
fairly satisfactory solution of the sit

that vessel. The fact that German
vessels have also been seized is held
to acquit Russia of any design to em
broil Great Britain with other powers.
The Malacca's passengers, -who have
arrived at Aden, the Morning Post

cers were civil, but made the strange
threat that if other ships were seized
with the same quantities of explosives
on board they would be sunk, no other
prize crews being available.

ST. PETERSBURG. July 25, 3:15
e. m. â The report that the Russian
volunteer fleet steamship Smolensk
fired shells at the British steamship
Ardova is not considered likely to en
danger the Anglo-Russian agreement.
It is pointed out that the Ardova had
no right to refuse to stop when or
dered. At the same time It is fully
realized, that the captain of the Smol
ensk should not have fired a ehell over
the decks of the Ardova,
There is considerable annoyance in
naval circles over the failure of the
vessels of the volunteer fleet to keep in
touch with St. Petersburg by cable.
Several days ago orders were cabled
to the St. Petersburg and Smolensk
Instructing them to abstain from the
further stoppage of vessels. These or
ders were subsequently rendered more
imperative and it is not too much to
Bay that they took the form of a recall
of both vessels.

the Immediate release of the Hamburg-
American line steamship Scandia,
which had arrived there and was

encountered the vessel at the Island of
Perlm, In the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb,
and that she was seized, notwithstand

special train from the encampment at
Santa Cruz. At camp all the morning,
prior and subsequent to worship, every
one was astir and at 2 o'clock p. m.
the generale was sounded and the

brought to a close one of the most
successful and delightful encamp

By gentlemanly like behavior and
discipline the cadets won the esteem
of the people of Santa Cruz, thousands
of whom were at the railway station
to bid them good-by on their departure.
The day opened with a grand mili
tary mass in the Casino. The regi

regimental band rendered a programme
of sacred music, including "Gloria,"
(Beethoven); hymn, "Come, Holy
Ghost;" "Rosary," (Grey); "Palms.**
(Fauvre); "the Lost Chord," (Sulli

The drum was beaten at consecration
by Sergeant James . Keane. . Father
O'Ryan in addressing the cadets
thanked Colonel James Power and all
the officers for the great work done
during the encampment and congratu

However, the decision of the Russian

Riven to the volunteer fleet to make

view of this new attitude of the Rus-

released promptly, the seizure dis
avowed and the incident will be closed
without delay.
No shipments or stores or other sup
plies made by the army or the navy

WASHINGTON, July 24.â SoW an
nouncement is expected to-morrow as
to whether the United States Govern

questions of the searching of neutral
ships by belligerent powers and of con
traband of war. The final decision
rests with Secretary Hay. Loomis,
first assistant Secretary of State, was
out of the city to-night and no one at
the department would say Just where
he was. The supposition was that he
had gone to hold a consultation with
the Secretary of State.
There is some question in the de
partment as to the advisability of
issuing a new proclamation at this time
on the question of neutral ships, simply
for the purpose of giving Information
to American owners. It is thought by
some Government officials to be wiser
for the United- States to remain quiet
on this question until some specific
case arises.
Professor John Bassett Moore's opin
ion is regarded in official circles here as
an able announcement of America's po
sition on contraband of war and any
proclamation from this Government on
the question Is likely to follow the gen
eral lines laid down by Professor
Moore.
State Department Officials Doubt Its
Advisability at This Time.

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
. The mill gates -will be opened at the
usual time to-morrow morning and the
operatives will be given an opportunity
to go to work under a wage reduction
of 12V6 per cent. If an insufficient num.
ber responds the mlll3 will be closed
for an Indefinite period. The strike
leaders were of the opinion to-night
that there would not be Â«nough opera
tives applying for work throughout the
entire city to run even one mill, to
say nothing of the eighty or more that
are affected by the strike order. The
manufacturers claim that the two
thousand union men who voted to
strike do not represent the sentiment
of the great body of cotton mill em
ployes. They give the total number
of operatives on their payroll as 25.630.
This, of course, does not include the
employes at thÂ« independent mills of
M. C. D. Borien, which are not in
volved.
The talk on the streets, however. In
dicates that the feeling against the
manufacturers is quite as bitter amone
the non-union operatives as it Is among
those who are affiliated with the labor
organizations.
John Golden, president of the United
Textile Workers of America, the leader
of the strike, has cautioned the opera
tives not to go near the mills to-mor
row. Many wild threats have been
made by an uninfluential class of
workers, but violence Is not expected.
FALL RIVER, Mass.. July 24.â With
hope of a peaceful settlement aban

determination the coming of to-mor
row and the first teat of strength be
tween a little group of manufacturers
representing a combined capital of
$25,000,000 on one side and more than
25,000 cotton mill operatives on the
other. ''â¢â¢.'â¢*Â¦'â¢'.'
In fact, the negotiations throughout
the crisis were conducted In a most
friendly spirit on both sides and the
etory that there was a stormy scene
in the Foreign Office on July 20, when
{Sir Charles "presented the British pro
test, has not the slightest foundation.
The relations between the Foreign
Minister and the British Embassador
are extremely cordial. Count Lams
riorff. although he rarely goes any
v. here, called at the British Embassy
last night and remained an hour in in
i'.rmal chat with Sir Charles Hardinge.
It is now reported that the libera
tion of the Peninsular and Oriental
-Ftramship Malacca will occur at Al
f.iers.
Orders have been sent . to the St.
Petersburg and Smolensk to refrain
from interferences with foreign ship
lung. It is expected these steamships
will eventually Join the Baltic fleet and
be replaced by ordinary warships.
The Russian and British Govern
ments' have agreed on a mutually sat
isfactory basis for a settlement of the
question of the status of Russian vol
unteer fleet steamships in the Red Sea
and the seizures by them of British
frhirs. A few minor points still remain
ui.settled. but these will be cleared up
to-morrow and it is not expected that
farther complications will arise.
Great credit for the satisfactory
termination of this incident Is due* to
Foreign Secretary Lamsdorff, who, it
Is admitted, acted in the calm and con
ciliatory spirit worthy of a great
statesman. The attitude of Sir Charles
Hardinge, the British Embassador.
both for moderation and dignity, also
evokes j'raise. . . â¢'
After a long discussion, in which
Count Lamsdorff took a leading part,
it was decided that the present status
of the volunteer fleet was not sufii
ciently well defined, according to in
ternational law, to render further
searches and seizures advisable, and
that, therefore, Russia, in the interests
of friendly relations with the powers,
enould withdraw the authority given
the volunteer Meet in this respect.
The result of the conference removes
all doubts concerning the present atti
tude of Russia with regard to the vol
unteer fleet. The validity of the view
expressed In the British note regarding
th<j irregularity of the position of the
vessels was so far admitted that the
council agreed to waive thÂ» right of
t-earch.

council, which Count Lamsdorff, the
Foreign Secretary, and Vice Admiral
-A\<?llan. chief of the Admiralty De
partment Â«md other high naval officers
intended.
"Chinese report that General Kuro
patkin. with 40,000 troops, is at Liao
jang, while his second in command,
with many men. Is still at Haicheng.
I still adhere to the opinion that the
Russians are not able to seriously op
pose the Japanese advance."
The Standard's correspondent with
the Japanese army under date of July
24 says:
Â¦ "It is difficult to understand the in
tentions of the Russians. Kuropatkin
is evidently bent on a retreat north
ward, yet he lingers in the south, at
tracted apparently by Port Arthur."
The correspondent of the Times with
General Kuroki's army says: â¢
Â¦'A junk from Dalny reports that
last night a Japanese Ueet of twenty
warships and twenty torpedo-boats
bombarded Hwangshin for three hours
and the forts replied."
The same correspondent learns that
the Japanese first array is being large
ly reinforced by veterans from the re
serves.
LONDON, July 25.â Specials to the
London morning papers confirm the
news of active operations at the seat
of war.
The Telegraph's Chefu correspondent,
under date of July 23, says:
The Chinese say that the Japanese
troops numbered 8000. The Russian
losses were one officer and four Cos
sacks wounded and a few horses killed.
Chinese scouts state that the Japan
ese are apparently establishing a base
in Korea, near the Yalu River, and
that there have been large movements
during the last few days from the
armies of Generals Kuroki and Oku to
Antung, on the Yalu. They say that
considerable camp equipment and pro
visions are being brought bv steam
ships, and it looks as though the Jap
anese were transferring their main
base from Japan to Korea. The Chi
nese also state that the latest Japan
ese troops consist of old men and boys,
apparently the last line of reserves.
SINTZINTIN (seventy miles east of
Mukden), July 24.â According to Chi
nese information, 30,000 Japanese, with
thirty-five field and 200 mountain guns,
have reached Saimatsza from the
south and have occupied the district
covered bv Saimatsza, lzvanchan and
Saiober. Four companies of Russian
cavalry and one company of infantry,
with two guns, came into contact with
the Japanese advance at 7 o'clock on
the morning of July 22 and discovered
that the Japanese, 1000 strong, were
advancing a mile and a half from Izy
arichan. The Russian guns checked
the advance, but, heavy reserves com
ing up, the Russians retired to a side
road near Uitzintzin to save them
selves from being cut off. The Japan
ese, however, did not continue to ad
vance.
Another handicap the packers will
meet with in the morning is a scarcity
of livestock. An estimate of the
amount of livestock in tho pens of the
packers to-night was 6000 cattle, 4000
hogs and 5000 sheep.
The packers claim to have nearly 5000
men with which to start operations to
morrow morning.
the most important body of men In tho
whole controversy. With these men on
strike the union forces expect to pre
vent any non-union men who take
their places from leaving the yards. and
scenes similar to those during: the
"caravan" days of the 1902 strike un
doubtedly will be the result if the
strike is prolonged. Teamsters outside
the yards are to be asked to refuse to
handle meat from any of the branch
houses, and if non-union men are en
gaged to perform this work riots are
certain to result.
These men will all work under po
lice protection and it is not believed
any trouble, will be experienced until
the several firms begin distributing
meats to the local tradÂ© with non
union drivers. It is on this apparent
predicament of the packers that the
labor leaders are depending on success
In the struggle.
The situation makes the teamsters
Preparations for the struggle were
being made at the different packing
plants all during the day and far into
the night. Dozens of representatives of
the packing-houses were sent through
the country in search of men to fill the
places of the strikers. Four trainloads
of new employes were taken into the
yards before darkness set in to Join the
non-union men already established in
side the plants. Clerks were being ini
tiated into new duties, and employes
who had been promoted, from trades
were returned to their former work to
take the places of the' regular workers,
who are expected to quit.
Stockades have been erected at all the
different plants to protect men whose
work exposes them to danger from mob
violence. \
In addition to the four trains filled
with non-union men s brought into the
yards- to-day under police protection,
many other trains loaded with men
who had been secured during the last
twenty-four hours were scheduled to
arrive before daylight. With the num
ber of men already Installed within
the stockyards and the addition of
clerks and office men to the killing
rooms, work will be resumed In all the
plants to-morrow morning on as ex
tended a scale as possible.
UNDER POMCE PROTECTION
CHICAGO, July 24.â Determined on a
fight to a finish to enforce the demands
of the Butchers' Union, a sympathetic
strike of all union workmen employed
in the meat-packing industry through
out the country, with the exception of
the teamsters, will be inaugurated to
morrow morning at 7 o'clock. The indi
cations to-night are that the teamsters
will join the other unions 'on Tuesday
in order to bring the packers to terms.
- The teamsters employed in the Chi
cago plants at a meeting to-day de
clared in favor of the sympathetic
strike, their decision being subject to
ratification by the Joint council of the
Teamsters' Union and its sanction by
the international officers.
. No conferences were held to-day,
either by the packers or the labor lead
ers, or jointly, in an effort to reach ah
adjustment of the controversy. Both
sides rested to-day, apparently waiting
for to-morrow's developments."
Whether or not the packers would
make any concessions to the demands
of. the labor leaders in order to prevent
a general walkout of the trades at the
stockyardSyWould not be discussed by
any of the packing-house representa
tives to-day, but from the preparations
going on at the different plants during
the day it was plainly evident that the
packers intended to fight for. their In
dependence.

stead, appointed a committee to communicate with the packers In an
effort to reopen peace negotiations. The sympathetic strike of tho

The mountain lion that has been such
a terror to the inhabitants of the

was seen yesterday several miles from
his first haunts around Schmidtville.
He appeared in an abandoned quarry
on the old Fish' Ranch road, where a\

of the beast as he slunk off into the
brush when frightened by them, but
that glimpse was enough to convince
them that he is a full grown animal.
To some of the men, inQeed, he looked
as big as an elephant and altogether
he corresponds in description to the
animal seen by the farmers of

The lion first made himself known In

Frank N. Dodd of the Aiameda Land
Company asserts that his firm is pre

attributes the building boom to the
lack of modern cottages and larger

Another matter that Mr. Dcdd believes
is responsible for the demand for homes
in Aiameda is the advertising the city
has been given throughout California
and in the Eastern States. He was one

of Aiameda in the larger magazines

The escapades of Lieutenants W. W.
White and Charles F. Smith at Angel
Island do not seem to have been con
fined to that post, at any rate so far
as .. White Is concerned, if rumor be
true. Soon after the escapades at Fort
McDowell in June, Â¦ White was sent
over to the discharge camp on the
eastern side of the island, where Smith
had previously been stationed. Both
were restricted by orders from leaving
that camp, pending the investigations
that were being made, by General Mac-
Arthur. White apparently, according
to rumor, cared very little about these
orders and much less about retaining
his commission, for it is reported that
one dark night he left his quarters,
and under the shadows of the trees,
stole along a narrow path until he
gained a small inlet on the beach. Here
a trusty friend from town was await
ing him with a rowboat.and brought
him over to this cUy. Here the high
places are said to have been touched
to the limit. It is reported that the
.fun was fast and furious, but was
mainly confined to shady nooks and
quiet corners, owing to the young
lieutenant's being away from his post
without leave. Search for him was
made in vain, and It was nearly a
week before he finally returned to his
quarters. What the result of these
gay and Joyous f rollcisms will be re
mnins for Colonel Markley and Gen

While the tiny corpse rested on a bier
ia one erf the rooms and kindly neigh
bors and physicians spent the day try
ing to save the other's life, the father
languished in a cell at the city prison,
eo deep in his cups that the officers
were unable to arouse him until this
evenicg, when they informed him of
the fa.te of his youngest child.
From what the physicians say pto
maine poisoning is ihe cause ut the
gloom in the Rohan home. None of
the family seem to be able to give a
clear account of how the youngsters
were taken ill. but neighbors believe
they ate canned salmon. The doctors
*ay that such an article of diet, if in
fected, could have produced the symp
toms they dettcted in both cases. A
boy 3 years of age passed away early
this morning. He had been ill but a
thort time. The present patient, a boy
5, is in a precarious condition and his
recovery is doubtfuL
The first intimaticm the police had
of the case was when the father was
arrested at Thirty-sixth street and San
Pablo avenue and brought to the sta
tion very drunk. A short time later
Dr. Paterson, who had been called to
attend the younger boy on Saturday,
called up Deputy Coroner Quellen on
the telephone and informed him that
ar Investigation should oe made. The
physician said that another child was
near to death and that an air of ab
solute indifference as to the fate of the
sick child prevailed about the place.
He said the same was true the night
before, and asked that some official in
quiry be made. Paterscn had request
ed the father of his patient to ring
him up early in the morning and let
him know how the boy was getting
along. Instead of reporting, the father
cot drunk. The physician called on
his own account about 10 o'clock, only
to find that his patient had expired a
Fhort time before, and that another
boy lay dangerously ill. , : Before Dr.
Paterson arrived, however, Drs. Dunn
and Lesault had been sent for and ad
ministered treatment to the latter pa
tient.

William J. Laymance of the Lay
mance Real Estate Company said to
day:
â¢ This has been the busiest vacation season
that I have ever experienced. Our renting de
partment has been active twenty properties
having been rented this week. Two-thlrda of
the applicants for houses are strangers here.
We have received more Inquiries from non
resident business men for Investment Income
property, but there are few desirable holdings
on the market. Owners of good properties
are not anxious to sell. Among the recent
tales made by our office are the following.
The rapid growth and general pros
perity of Oakland during the last year
has attracted the attention of people
from all parts of the East and real
estate dealers are receiving Inquiries
every day regarding the prices of prop
erty in this city. These inquiries come
not only from home seekers, but also
from real estate speculators and from
men seeking business investments. A
well-known local broker said this
morning that the majority of sales
made by him during the week were
to non-residents of Oakland.
The chief difficulty experienced by
real estate men is to secure a sufficient
number of cottages and small homes to
accommodate prospective renters. As
the vacation season draws to a close
this difficulty will increase. This con
dition is a considerable surprise to local
brokers, for during the year many
houses of this class have been built to
rent, and in addition many apartment
houses and flats have been erected.

lightning. Number one of a squad is

forming bridges over ravines the pig
tails are also indispensable.
After a hearty open ah* chow and
some brisk skirmish work the yellow
warriors returned to. the almond-eyed
girls they left behind.
To the tunft of "Good-by Da-Lee

Through the China lilies that

front, giving all their atention to
the arduous "haytfoot, straw foot" in
strict military fashion and ignoring
the enraptured belles.
Captain Wong Kam, the slant-eyed
descendant of a thousand mandarins,
commanded. He was as full of dig

Walter H. Frost and Miss Millie
Redell were married Thursday, July 14.
at the home of the bride's parents, 221
Fell street. The ceremony was attend
ed by many friends and relatives. They
hive taken apartments at the Ainsley.
A pretty wedding took place yes
terday afternoon in St. Boniface's
Church on Golden Gate avenue, when
Charles Aregger and Miss Regina Roh
rer were united in the presence of a
small party of friends and relatives.
The ceremony was performed by the
Rev. Father Maximillian Neumann.
The bride, who is a native of Switzer
land, is a tall and stately brunette,
and .she was very attractive in her
nuptial gown of sheer lace over chrt
fon and silk.- She wore a flowing tulle
veil, and carried lilies of the valley.
Miss Josephine Rohrer, a. sister of
the bride, handsomely gowned, served
as bridesmaid. She carried a shower
bouquet of marguerites. David Areg
ger was best man.
After the -marriage a banquet was
served at a downtown restaurant to a
large number of invited guests. The
couple took a late train for the south
on their honeymoon. The groom has
been In business in this city for sev
eral years. The event was the culmin
ation of a romance that began in
Switzerland when the bride was but
sixteen years of age.
WEDDINGS.
The faithful in every age have invoked the
intercession of the saints, and if their prayers
have not been answered always they have
been answered frequently when It was for
their good.
Honor the eaints by visiting their shrines,
and by their shrines I mean their tombs, or
churches bearing 1 their names and containing
their relics. Some three years ago I visited
the city of Apt. in Southeastern France, where
we are told by the Bollandists. the Jesuit
writers, that the body of St. Ann is pre
served. Accordtns to them, the sacred re
mains were brought frorft Jerusalem to the
Roman city of Apta Julia by Lazarus, Mary
Mardalen. Martha and others. They were
committed to the charge of Bishop Auspicious,
a disciple of St. Peter. During the persecu
tions this sacred deposit was hidden in the
crypt of the church. It was discovered anew
by Charlemagne, as we learn from a letter
from him to Pope Adrian, as well as the reply
which the Pontiff wrote to the Emperor. God
has worked wonders through the relics of the
saints. In the fourth book of Kings we read
of a dead man who was restored to life by
touching the dead body, of a prophet. A wo
man was cured of disease by touching the gar
ment of the Savior. Touch and have faith and
your faith will make you whole. Invoke the
intercession of the saints constantly, for by so
doing you will not only be benefltting your
selves, but you will be obeying the command
of the apostle, "Render honor to whom honor
Is due." â¢
We can honor the saints by making them
intercession : by visiting their shiines, and by
venerating their relics. We invoke the inter
cession cf the saints because they see hore
and assist us in heaven. In the parable of
the lost sheep our Savior declares that the
angels rejoice over the conversion of the sin
ner, but they could not so rejoice if they did
not witness the operation of grace In his soul,
and his change of heart and conduct. And If
they know what passes in his heart and soul
they can hear our prayers, because we utter
them with our lips and waft them heavenward.
What we *ay of the angels is applicable to
the saints, for the Lord has declared that
"the saints are as the angels of God in heav
en." St. Augustine, held and practiced the
belief that the Faints see and hear us, as is
evident from his apostrophe to St. Paul:
"You now reicn with Christ, together with
him whom ye stoned, St. Stephen. You both
see and hear this, my discourse. I desire you
both to Dray for us." * Â¦
ACitrdine to the apostle, we should render
honor to whom honor is due. Among thusu
whom we should honor are the saints and ser
vants of God. They have been honored by
itui! lymself. because he has bestowed upon
them his grace most abundantly and makes
them the instruments of his power in working
wonders. The church honors them, for she
has Inscribed their names upon her calendar.
She places their relics upon her altars and
she celebrates their feasts.

The Chicago Woiraa'a dub. now grown to

organized by twenty-one women twenty-eight
>c_ra ago the 17th of February. Its declared
clject was:
During the summer months, when i
the clubrooms are in the custody of
janitors and maids, inspection intb the
lives of other clubs â clubs beyond our
physical visionâ is attracting the at
tention of progressive clubwomen. For,
however clever our organizations may
be â and many of them are very clever
and broad and cultivating â there's al
ways room for expansion.
Among the clubs that attracted the
greatest amount of attention at the
late biennial (this sounds funereal,
but the meet wasn'tâ not a bit of it)
v.as the Chicago Woman's Club. This
organization seems to me to be one of
the broadest and cleverest in America.
Therefore I beg to outline briefly its
principles, its activities and a few of
'its resultsâ even if it be a far cry
from home. And in quoting from an
article in "The Club Woman," pre
pared by Mrs. G. W. Plummer, let me
prefaca the quotation by stating that
California really has no apologies to
n.^ke to Illinois, or any other State, for
that matter, for the Quality of our
'..omen's clubs, and the women who
compose them. But an interchange of
ideas is conducive to healthy growth â
hence the Chicago Woman's Club, to
wit:
By the conservatism and sincerity of its
work, the Chicago Woman's Club has gained
the respect and confidence of the citizens of
Chicago. Its aid is sought and its appeals
always meet a prompt response.
It has a membership now of a thousand,
drawn from every walk of life, of varying
creeds, nationalities, even races. It has grown
mentally and spiritually as well as numeri
cally, albeit, not without its "growing pair.s."
It i* a far cry from the day when it debated
whether it were wise to .even discuss suf
frage in executive session 1> the crucial hour
when it travailed In the decision as to whether
its motto was a pretty fancy or a liÂ«ng prin
ciple. It has worked and faltered, has failed
and succeeded, stumbled and girded Itself
anew to fresh endeavor. Nowhere is there
another such organization â thoroughly demo
cratic, wholly unique: women of wealth, cul
ture and high social position banded with
those less fortunate in a worldly sense, hon
oring only ability, high Ideals and noble lives.
Â¦Women who. without that common ground of
the Woman's Club, would j never know each
other here, weld hearts in a life-long friend
ship. Settlement worker and leader oC society.
Jew' and Gentile, black and white, rich and
poor alike labor together for the good of men
and.' therefore, to the glory of God.
Many of the members of the club are busi
ness women: teachers, physicians, lawyers,
etc. and practically debarred from hearing the
papers, lectures and muslcalea which are given"
to the club on Wednesday afternoons. For
their sake, and that of other women, who. on
account of a business life, have little leisure
during the week the club decided several
years aro to open Its door* on Sunday after
noons and to have repeated there the best of
the club's programme*, with such additions or
changes as might seem best. The result has
been most satisfactory. The rooms have been
taxed to thfir capacity with a most interested
and interesting audience. Many of the club
members declare thÂ«?se meetings to be the best
part of the club work.
Now, fellow-clubwomen, what do you
think of these achievements? If any
of you are wedded to grumpy men
who sneer at "women's clubs," just
tell them a few of these things that
Chicago â even male Chicago â owns up
to. It may, if their minds be not
hermetically sealed, start a new
thought into life.
It wis through the philosophy and science
department that Professor Breasted went to
Egypt for exploration purposes, and the results
Of his labors the department presented to the
Field Museum of Chicago.
In addition to the public work, study classes
are carried on by the various departments for
the benefit *f all members of the club, and
literary and musical as well as practical pro
grammes are given bi-monthly.
The income of the club is derived from a
yearly due of $12 and an Initiation fee of $25.
It expends about $700<) yearly for 'rent, and
after paying the running expenses incident to
such a club, the remainder goes mainly to in
crease and maintain its activities. It puts by
little for the proverbial "rainy day," and as
it is its policy not to glv* fetes or pntertaln
mÂ»r.ts to raise money, it dives deep into indi
vidual pockets and attracts from outside
source? when the call for funds for some new
enterprise is imperative. (Al?_Â» ncte this,
ladtes.)
The art and literary department not only
has study classes in art, literature and music,
but engages in reform and philanthropic work
alcng Its lines; aÂ«. witness, the establish
ment cf a scholarship of $1500 in the Art In-
Mitute to be competed for by the seniors in
the city high schools; the giving of exhibi
tions of the pictures of local artists, the pur
chase for the clubrooms of several valuable
works of art, the establishment of the small
park system in the city, and finally, the mu
ral decoration of an audience-room in the
McKinley High School, the latter involving
an expenditure of thousands of dollars.
In UK the financial depression in Chicago
necessitated the raising of large sums to re
lieve distress among the unemployed. The
Woman's Club sent out a call to the other and
similar women's organizations of the city and
together they established nine workrooms,
where sewinf? was Riven to women who applied
in order that they might support their fami
lies. Twenty thousand dollars was paid out
In this way, distress avoided and the self-re
spect of the recipient preserved.
From this beginning: grew the Model Lodg
inc-hou!>e, 'which furnishes temporary lodging
at the small price cf 15 cents a night. Falling
even this pittance, the lodger may "work out"
the amount. The plan has been very success
ful and the work is carried on as the "emer
gency work" by a number of women's clubs
working- together.
Many societies have been bcrn in the club
and gone out Into the world to battle valiantly
and successfully: The Protective Agency for
Women and Children, a society which gives
legal aid and moral support to wronged women
and children; the Physiological Institute,
which opened courses of weekly lectures for
Instruction of working women In the princi
ples of hygiene and sanitary / science; the Mu
nicipal Order League, now merged into the
Civic Federation; the Household Economics,
the Society for Correct Dress, the Political
Equality League, whose object is to promote
the ttudy of political science and to foster and
extend political rights and privileges of wo
men; the Public School Art Association, which
places good casts and pictures in public
schools, secures harmonious coloring on walls,
blackboards, etc.; the School Children's Aid
Society, now If teen years old, which dis
penses from $701*0 to $00CO a year in keeping
destitute children clothed in order that they
may attend school.
that period there have been two. Two women
a* assistant superintendents owe their posi
tions also to the same influence largely, and
the election of women as trustees of the State
University at Champaign. 111., is directly due
to work done In the club.
Another of the good works in which the club
took an active Interest was /the Glenwood
School, an Industrial school for boys. It
raised $4i>,U0O lor this purpose and one of the
buildings bears its:, name in commemoration of
this fact.

there TverÂ° so many calls for Postum
It was served regularly and many were
induced to try it. myself among the
number. How delighted I was to find
it so agreeable, delicious and satisfj'-
ing. As I had suffered from nervous
prostration a change from tea and cof-
fee was imperative, but all these
troubles disappeared after I had used
the Postum faithfully for a few weeks.
"A sister and a son-in-law were con-
verted to Postum at the same time and
now we all enjoy it as well as we ever
did coffee, but instead of making us
nervous like coffee we enjoy steady
nerves, sleei> Â«ound and are in every
way better &>r the change." Name
given by Postum Co., Battle Creek,
Mich. \ *
This lady found what she thought
was natural nervousness was only due
to an acquired taste for coffee that is
to some people a sure destroyer of
rerves and heaTth. Like her, anyone
who cuts off coffee altogether and uses
well boiled Postum In Its place will be
greatly benefited after a few days and
the return to health is a Joyful Journey.

Special Corrr5pcr.dcnce of The Call
Not long ago a very rich man in the
north of England discovered that one
section of his gardens was rendered
useless through exposure to the keen
east wind. This was not to be toler
ated, said the great man, and to keep
the eastern blasts from trespassing he
planted thousands of Scotch and Nor
wegian fir trees to act as a screen, pay
ing as much as Â£5 for individual trees.
This little whim cost him*nearly Â£20,
000, but he considered himself amply
rewarded by seeing his wilderness
turned into a paradise of flowers.
In such gardens as these it is quite
usual to employ as many as seventy
or eighty men and boys, so that a
Cabinet Minister's yearly salary may
easily go in wages alone. It is said
that there are^ 900 country houses in
Great Britain each of which employs
a staff of over fifty men; of these, 200
employ between eighty and 150, while
sixty of them employ over 200; and the
large majority of all these male serv
ants are gardeners of one kind or an
other.
In addition to the cost of labor there
are repairs and alterations of houses,
furnaces to be fed, walls built for fruit
growing, nets for protection, tools to
buy and replace, and â often the most
costly ttem of allâ seeds and plants to
purchase. Baron Schroder is credited
with having spent 'Â£40,000 on his col
lection of orchids, and Sir Trevor Law
rence with an expenditure of Â£30,000.
Joseph Chamberlain has thirteen
glass houses containing, roughly, 6000
plants, many of them of great value
and gathered from almost every part
of the earth where orchids are to be
found. The plants are arranged in dif
ferent houses according to the time of
flowering, so that the succession of ex
quisite flowers never fails the whole
year round. Each plant bears its num
ber as well as its name, and it. Is said
that Mr. Chamberlain knows every one'
of his floral pets.â London Tit Bits.
One gets an impressive idea of the
extent of such gardens as these when
we hear that the kitchen garden alone
at Welbeck covers thirty acres, that
the houses in which peaches, apricots
and nectarines are grown stretch for a
quarter of a mile, and that to stock
them cost as much as Â£10,000. When a
millionaire sets his heart on making
himself a lordly pleasure-garden we
may be sure that he recks little of the
cost.
Further than this, there are, on the
best authority, more than 5000 "seats
of the mighty," or at least of the rich,
the gardens of which cost their owners
anything almost from Â£500 a year up
ward into the thousands: while there
are as many more which demand be
tween Â£200 and Â£500 a year for their
maintenance. Of these 10,000 British
gardens an annual sum estimated at
ovr Â£2,000 000 is spent for labor alone;
and another round million pounds at
least goes in the purchase of seeds,
plants and manures, and the general
upkeep of the gardens and glass houses.
To this must be added the tens of
thousands of gardens of the well-to-do
classes on which sums ranging from
Â£10 to perhaps Â£100 a year are spent,
and the hundreds of thousands of more
modest gardens, each, however, a
source of pride and pleasure to Its
owner, which cost from a few shillings
to a few pounds a year.
It is difficult and. perhaps, invidious
to say which are the most costly gar
dens in Great Britain; but among them
are certainly those of Trentham Hall,
Welbeck Abbey, Lord Bute's gardens
at Cardiff Castle, the world-famous
gardens of Chatsworth, and those of
the* Rothschilds, on which .gold has
been lavished like water.
It has been said that there are a
score of noblemen in the United King
dom who spend more every year on
th^ir gardens than Â¦would pay the of
ficial salaries of the entire Cabinet;
cr.d. extravagant as the statement may
appear, it is well within the limits of
truth.

No Tea for Mattoon.
Custom-House Broker J. S. Mattoon
scowls whenever he is asked as to
what brand of tea he likes, because
the question recalls a very disagree
able episode in connection with a tea
transaction which caused no end of
good-humored raillery at Broker Mat
toon's expense.
Mattoon likes tea, and prides him
self upon his ability to state, merely
from inspection of the used leaves, the
particular district in China or Ceylon
where the tea was grown, as well as
its variety and value. One day he re
ceived from a grateful client a five
pound box of his favorite brand and
this he placed in keeping of the pro
prietor of la chophouse not far from
the Custom-house. The broker gave
orders that whenever he should call
for tea at his lunch he should be
served out of his personal and ex
clusive box.
Mattoon Is not at all selfish, and de
siring that his friends should also en
joy the aroma of his favorite bever
age, invited three of them to lunch
with him the next day. The brokers
and Mattoon were at the chophouse
punctually at noon and ordered por
ter house steaks at their host's ex
pense. When the waiter, who was a
stranger, appeared with the steaks
Mattoon ordered him to brew four
pots of Â»tea from, the special box.
The waiter did not seem to under
stand.
"Send for Spirovich, the proprietor,"
demanded the broker.
"Oh," replied the waiter, "Spiro
vich sold out yesterday and went to
Seattle. He didn't leave any box of tea
here."
In Old Jersey.
Regarding mosquito broods and the
number of specimens that develop
within a limited area, few persons rec
ognize the fact that breeding is Inten
sive rather than extensive. It la not
that there is a scattering of wrigglers
over a large area. There Is, on the
! contrary, a concentration of speci
mens within a limited space. The
best illustration of that was seen last
year in one of the New Jersey resorts,
where a small pond, with an area of
1894 square feet, produced in one
brood over ten million, six hundred
thousand specimens. This will seem
almost incredible to those who have
never 83en a really well-populated
mosqui co-pool; but the estimate was
carefully made after hours of work, in
which every part of the pond was
sampled and the larvae in each sam
ple were counted. There were two
similar ponds close by, and the com
bined-output was quite sufficient to
give the place a full supply. If one
million mosquitoes are. distributed
among one thousand porches, each
will get one thousand examples; and
I need not emphasize the fact that
even one hundred healthy specimens
will drive a dozen people indoors when
they â the mosquitoes â are really hun
gry. â Booklover's Magazine.

The stnange and sudden dignity of death.
â Itichard E. Burton, in Scrlbner's.
PROFESSOR JACQUES LOEB, the daring in
vestigator into nature's innermost secrets, has sent
forth from his laboratory over in Berkeley a mes
sage which must startle into breathless attention scien
tist and layman alike. With all the careful conservatism
of science Professor Loeb recently announced that his
series of experiments in the artificial fertilization of the
eggs of lower orders of life had led him to believe that
for mankind a natural death never comes â that by bodily
disabilities alone, and these open to curative measures,
is Jhe human being robbed of life before his time.
"It is by no means certain," said the scientist in his
recent exposition of artificial egg fertilization, "that
death, even in old age, can be called 'natural death.' We
know that as a rule death is caused by the fact that some
important organ is disabled, but we are far from certain
that such inability is unavoidable." This tenet of the
savant's comes only as the result of actual operations
in checking and turning aside the progress of death in the
eggs of the starfish and the sea urchin where dissolution
was imminent from within the embryonic body itself
and not as the result of external causes..
In the grand scheme of life, of which man is supposed
to be at present the highest, the most complex organ
ism, the scientists tell us that there is one universal law
of growth, unchanged in the processes of evolution. If
man may bring life to the germ of the starfish, and ward
from the same ''impending death, what may not man
do for himself, whose life is governed by the same
formula, advanced only to a higher degree of.complexity?
Does not Professor Loeb's dictum carry with it an ele
ment of the sublime in the immensity of its concept?
Not long ago Professor Elie .Metchnikoff, a pupil of
the great Pasteur, approached the conclusions Professor
Loeb has announced from a different train of reasoning
and experiment. By eliminating what Metchnikoff terms
"the disharmonies," or incongruities of organic action in,
the body, man may, according to his conception, find a
natural death. Then, and then only, will the tired
worldling lay him down to welcome the last process
of nature, coming gently, naturally as sleep.
'The normal end," says Metchnikoff," coming after
the appearance of the instinct of death, may truly be re
garded as the ultimate goal of human existence."
Strange thought?, these. Can man be ma,de the arbiter
of his death through science? If there is a "natural
death," whose pangs we have never tasted, will it be
indeed that, enjoying such, man may feel even a longing
for death when all of his tired members have gradually
lost; their springs of action and the true end of the day
is drawing nigh?

About him and lies down to pleasant dreams.

NO STRINGS ON HIM.
Puissant Tsi An.
When the time came for adieus her
Majesty mingled with her guests, the
Emperor following closely, and as Mrs.
Conger got beyond me I stepped aside
for royalty. Imagine my astonishment
when the Empress Dowager turned,
took me by both hands, stroked my
arm and inquired how I liked
China and how long I would re
main, concluding by asking me to come
and see her again when I returned to
visit Mrs. Conger! I did not lose my
equanimity, but studied this most re
markable woman at closest range.
Could she of dignified mien, deep-set,
unflinching eyes, rare smile and melo
dious voice be the most despotic female
sovereign in the history of the world?
Has she two distinctly opposite na
tures? Is this the secret of her mar
velous power? Born in obscurity, the
daughter of a minor officer, a favorite
concubine of. the harem, young and in
experienced, she reached the pinnacle of
authority by incredible ability, shrewd
ness and daring. Through all the in
trigue of the Chinese court since she
first usurped the throne she has borne
a charmed life, and her enemies have
arisen only to disappear with terrible
swiftness, while her autocracy remains
unchallenged. With relentless will she
has stripped the Emperor of the last
vestige of the legitimate authority
which for a Tarief period he had exer
cised under the wise guidance of Kang
Yu Wei, absolutely controlling his every
word and act. as well as the earthly
destiny of 400,000,000 of subjects.
And this most fascinating hostess,
urging us to "stay longer" and "come
again," annihilating conventionality
and precedent, was Tsi An, the great
woman ruler in this land of Confucius,
where to be a woman,, according to the
philosophy of the great sage, is to be
despised among men!â From Minnie
Norton Wood's "Summer Splendor of
the Chinese Court," in the August Cen
tury.
THE first steps in the Republican campaign show
the perfect independence of President Roosevelt.
He went clear of the machine in selecting Mr. Cor
telyou as chairman of the National Committee and in
every act and frank expression shows "that no one has
any strings upon him. The publy: has the key to his
next administration in his own full and free expressions.
He will administer the law, regarding none as above and
none as below it. He will advise the reinforcement of
the law wherein it seems to require strengthening. He
will regard always that equality of right which is the
American birthright.
While no President has been more dutifully respect
ful of the limitations of the constitution, with' the ex
ception of Lincoln, none has been more virulently ac
cused of destroying the fundamental law. Lincoln
was accused of tyranny, of destroying the lib
erties of his countrymen, and these accusations fired the
brain of his assassin, who condensed all attacks upon the
great liberator in his dramatic shout of "Sic Semper
Tyrannis" as he jumped from the scene of his crime upon
the stage of Ford's Opera-house and made his escape
through the wings. Yet Lincoln left to the country
four millions more of free men than were in it when he
took the oath of office and to all men more liberty than
they ever had before. . N -
The memory of this should deter the Democracy
from repeating upon his successor the tactics . of
which they made such reckless use during the
Civil War. But it will have no such effect. The high
financiers, who have been checked in their schemes by
the determined front of the President, are, in their way,
sincere when they accuse him of interfering with liberty,
meaning their liberty to' dodge the law and to^Molate
the' restraints of morality in business. But the people
understand that in a republic liberty is for all under the
law and that liberty ior the few to disregard the law
means abridgment of the just and lawful liberty of the
many.
There is a deep-seated sense and conviction that Pres
ident Roosevelt represents all that is excellent in
citizenship and policy and principle that has been com
mon to all deserving statesmen of either party. Elder
Democrats find him representing those policies in ad
ministration which they were taught to^ respect and Re
publicans : find him illustrating that awakened national
conscience in which their part^ was born. He has no
strings on him, but embodies the aspirations of the whole
people. ";i j:; v '
Swallow, candidate of the Prohibition party for Presi
dent of the United States, declares in his address of ac
ceptance that he is far from being assured "of defeat.
Inspired by such optimism as this, no failure possible in

"Uncle Joe's' Coup.
"Uncle Joe" Cannon tells this story
of his early days in the practice of the
law in Illinois: .
Patrick McDonald, an Irishman, was
a well-known character in the town of
Danville. He was a loud talker and
was constantly "butting in" where he
wasn't wanted. â¢ ''Â¦?''."-'-.
Harrison Wheelock, who was known
throughout the county by the contrac
tion of "Hat," was another local
celebrity. Wheelock was talking with
a fellow citizen in the main street
one afternoon, when McDonald came
up and attempted to participate in the
conversation. "Get, out of this," said
Wheelock, and when McDonald at
tempted to parley, the former made a
lunge at him with his strong right
arm.
McDonald ran like the wind, and
Wheelock was close after him. Later
in the day Wheelock was placed un
der arrest by a constable on a warrant
sworn out by McDonald, who charged
that Wheelock had threatened him
and that he felt his life endangered.
"Hat" Wheelock retained Cannon,
then a young lawyer struggling for
a reputation, to defend him. The case,
which was heard before a local Justice,
attracted a large number of the towns
men. McDonald had given his version
of the affair, when" "Uncle Joe" start
ed in to the cross-examination. After
A NATURAL DEATH.
Another San Francisco' woman, swindled in the man
ipulations .of a marriage bureau,, has poured her tale of
woe into the sympathetic ears of the police. Her sav
ings are gone and with them has disappeared the male
creature she accepted as a husband. The lady should
contribute the incident to her store of experience that
sometimes but not frequently proves profitable in new
ventures. '<^sj
THE condition of trade remains about the* same as
for several weeks past. The weather and crop
prospects are still the governing factors, and as
the former has improved and the latter arc excellent,
the confident feeling which appeared a month or so ago
is still apparent. There will be a loss in the" wheat crop
from earlier estimates, but it will not be as large as
feared ten days ago, while corn and cotton are making
I a most excellent showing.
It as figured that on the present outlook we ought to
! get a corn crop of about 2,500,000,000 bushels, yielding
the growers about $1,000,000,000, not to mention its
added value in pork and beef. The cotton crop, if it
amounts to 11,000,000 bales, which is an average estimate
at present, should return the planters about $400,000,000,
j to say nothing of the increment to railroads, exporters
i and manufacturers; so that from these two crops alone
I there ought to be an enhancement to the country's wealth
i of more than $1,500,000,000. Then there is a wheat crop
! of something like 615,000,000 bushels, now worth some
; thing like 87.V< cents per bushel, or say $550,000,000 in
i round numbers. The three crops, therefore, on the
j present basis of prospects and prices figure out an
addition to the farmers' pockets of s'ay $2,000,000,000
! during the coming year. Of course, this is only one re
sult; there are many others in the form of railroad earn
ings, wages, clothing, shipping, etc. In fact, the list of
j industries benefited by these three crops might be in-
I definitely extended, considering that their ramifications
radiate into all branches of trade.
This exhibit is what the leading financial and commer
cial interests of the country are basing their cheerful
views upon" at present, and as it is simply a case of
i arithmetic, unconnected with any speculation, it must
! be admitted it is a very fair foundation upon which to
I build expectations. Of course, mishaps are possible, but
these are always figured in as contingencies. On this
showing Wall street is shouting "Good times!" and try
ing to run up the price of stocks, though, it must be
confessed, with indifferent success, for just as soon as
; the public are prepared to re-enter the investment field
j something comes along and scares them off again.
! For instance, when better reports were being received
from the iron and steel trade and it was freely said that
; the bottom had probably been touched in this industry,
â¢ the Iron Age comes out with the cynical remark that
I the only improvement visible in iron and steel is in Wall
street, whereupon the buoyant market gives two or three
gasps and slowly collapses like a rent balloon. Or the
packing-house strike is no sooner apparently settled and
j the commercial atmosphere begins to clear when the
j men take their dinner pails and walk out again, and there
j is another collapse. Or just when the wheat crop is
looking fine and the weather is reported almost perfect
along the whole belt, Kansas comes along with the
, third flood this year and down comes our house of
cards again. There is always something happening to
that brilliant pasteboard mansion.
Still, with all these backsets, the crop outlook is ex
. cellent and even the most conservative interests of the
country are looking forward to another fair year. It
will be quieter than its three or four immediate pre
decessor^, but nobody expects anything serious to hap
pen. There is too much money lying around. We are
very, very rich, and furthermore, sound. Almost all
dubious elements have been eliminated and we are doing
business again in more of the old-fashioned way. Labor
troubles are the principal drawback at present, but it
will be observed that they are briefer and less violent
than they were a couple of years ago. Wiser counsels
now prevail and strikes are fewer and more quickly set
tled. Capital and labor are both tired of these injurious
wrangles and there is a general disposition to avoid
them.
Commercial reports last week were almost uniformly
cheerful. Many of the larger cities are reporting a bet
ter jobbing and retail trade, though collections are not
as prompt as for the past several years. The jobbers
report'a good and gradually increasing demand for gen
eral merchandise from the farming districts.. There is a
better feeling in the dry goods trade at New York, with
out, however, any appreciable enlargement in the move
ment. The remarkable scramble for wool has imparted
a bullish aspect to the woolen trade, though there is no
particular rush among the mills. Provisions continue
quiet and dragging more or less at all packing points.
Prices for cattle, sheep and hogs are slowly declining,
but they have been too high for the good of the country
at large, and the stock raiser can jrtand a little deprecia
tion in his product without serious injury. There is
rather more doing in the leather trade, and the packing
house strike is diminishing the output of hides. There
are no features in the grocery trade worthy of especial
comment.
Railway earnings thus far in July show the small loss
of 1.5 per cent from the corresponding time last year.
The bank clearings last week were again on the right
side of the exhibit, though the gain over 1903 was only
.8 per cent. Still, most of the large cities showed an
increase, and the aggregate clearings were $2,171,836,000,
an excellent showing. The failures for the week were
213, against 191 last year, and none of them were of
sufficient importance to attract attention. Money con
tinued in enormous supply and weak at & to I per cent
for call and 2 to 3% per cent for time loans. These are
pretty low rates."
Our local conditions continue bright. The crops of
wheat and barley in . California are turning out lighter
than expected, but there is \no famine, and the loss in
quantity will probably be offset by the excellent prices
which the grain is bringing. During the early part of
the week there was a scramble for barley in the Sacra
mento Valley, and in their eagerness for supplies buyers
paid more in the country than the grain would bring in
San Francisco. The spring wool clip is cleaned up and
the fall clip will come in on a bare and very strong
market. The hop crop is looking excellently and prices
continue, away above the' cost of production â something
like 100 per cent. The hop growers have been making
money for several years. Stocks of dried fruits, except
prunes and raisins, are cleaned up and the new crop
goods are in demand at very good prices, while the fresh
fruit has been selling very well all the -season. The
dairy trade has enjoyed a surprising demand, for months/
though the markets have lately* shown the usual mid
summer dullness. The output of butterand eggs this
year has been of enormous volume, but 'the market has
absorbed it, showing a pronounced increase in the popu
lation of the city and State at, large. In fact, whichever
way we turnâ toward country or city â we find the same
expanding markets for. our products and the same re
ports of increasing population. If the present influx of
newcomers from across the mountains- continues the
next census, will surprise a good many people! Times in

Slav Measurements.
At the recent gathering of the As
sociation of Academies Sir .A. Geikie
moved a resolution, which was unani
mously adopted, in favor of interna
tional co-operation in the efforts to
obtain "precise determination of levels
in mountain chains subject to earth
quakes, with the view of ascertaining
whether such chains are stable, or are
undcrgoingr'movements of deviation or
depression." Another proposal aimed
to secure measurements of the value
of gravity, with the object, so far as
geological questions are concerned, of
throwing light on the internal dis
tribution of masses in the earth and
on the rigidity or isostasy of the ter
restrial crust. These problems call for
| minute and rigorous observation. In
I this way it is believed to have been
proved that the land about 'the city of
New York Has been subsiding since
1875 at the rate of about 1.45 feet
(nearly 17% inches) per century. Pos

According to reports from home
Americans have been offered one or
two rather indifferent entertainments
in the musical comedy line from this
side of the water recently, but one
which is likely to reach the United
Etates before Jong is practically sure
of ita welcome. This is "Sergeant
Brue," the new musical comedy by
Owen Hall, author of "The Girl From
Kay's." which has succeeded "A Chi
nese Honeymoon," at the Strand The
ater. I eaid something soon after Owen
Hall started work on this piece regard-
Ing the novelty of the main Idea.
"Sergeant Brue" is, of course, a police
man, wÂ£o Is left a tremendous fortune,
which is to remain his, however, only
Â¦while he remains on the force, unless
It should happen that he Is made an
inspector, when the testator permits
him to retire. Brue, however, is a
man of lew brains; an inspectorship is
practically out of the question as far
as he is concerned, and so though pos
sessed of the Income of an American
millionaire and of a house in Park
Lane, he is compelled to keep on pa
trolling his beat day after day as con
scientiously as if he were drawing the
ordinary salary of a "bobby." After
awhile, however, it happens that Brue,
while off duty, befriends a well known
"crook," who out of gratitude declares
that he will enable Brue to win pro
motion by discovering to him the
â¢â¢/elonious utie plans" of his con
freres. But the coups thus arranged
never come off; always land Brue in
hot water, in fact, instead of getting
him,, any nearer his inspectorship.
How he finally attains this rank
it would not be fair to tell,
but it is only after many laugh
able situations. Here the part
of Sergeant Brue is played by Willie
Edouin, and i3 quite the best thing he
has done since his Hoggenheimer in
The Girl From Kay's." The part of
the crook is taken by Arthur Williams,
who was seen in the United States
with Iiawtrey Jn "A Message From
Mars," and the scenes between these
two are among the best that have
been given on the stage this
season. Unless new songs can
be interpolated, however, the
piece will have to depend on its
humor for its success, Madame Liza
Lehinaim's much-talked of score hav
ing proved indifferent as a whole,
though one bright exception is a ditty
called "Mother Eve," novel both in
theme and melody. Altogether "Ser
vant Brue" will give an American
company no end of opportunities,
â¢ * â¢
Â¦\vhom the audiences here will take to
their hearts as Edna May, Phyllis
Rankin, Dan Daly, Frank Lawton and
E. J. Sullivan, who played the "polite
lunatic," were taken. John W. Ransone
peems to be the popular favorite at
present. His interpretation of the trav
eling brewer, with his constant query,
"Vas you effer in Cincinnati?" does not
appeal over here as strongly as it must
have done at home, but he gets his
laugh from beginning to end and is es
pecially funny in the song â which he
has substituted for "It Was the Dutch"
â"I'm On the Water Wagon Now,"
though audiences here have only a
vague idea of what being on the water
wagon means. The "Song of the Cit
ies" is a great go, particularly the New
Tork girl's part of it; but, speaking
generally, it seems to be the chorus
work and the novel "effects" that hit
the audiences here hardest. If they
can keep on doing as well at the
Shaftesbury as they are at present the
success of Musgrove's "London home
of American musical comedy" will be
assured.

Hut a considerable per cent of the decay
which the oranges suffer in transit may bo
due to causes which we do not yet understand.
Ar.d just here we need the help of the Depart
ment cf Agriculture. We hope for Important
results from the investigations which are to be
made tinder the direction of Mr. Powell; and
the crowers should co-operate fully with any
expert or experts he may send here, so that
this problem may be thoroughly studied. We
cannot afford to loss any 10 per cent of our
fruit in transit by decay, which may be due
to preventable causes.
The Pasadena Press finds that a
problem worth considering is before
the orange growers of the State and
says that something may be done to
diminish the percentage of loss on
oranges on their way to the Eastern
market. In part the Press says:
The orange growers who read the reports of
sales in the East cannot fall to note the
frequent recurrence of items like this: "Seven
to 15 per cent decay," or "10 to 20 per cent
dÂ»cay" ; "much fruit sold low because.lt ar
rive in Door ordÂ«r."
Now any fruit that reaches the market In a
decayed condition is worse man a. dead loss.
WÂ« have to pay freight on it and packing and
icing charge?, just as much as If sold "extra
fancy," instead of being dumped out. And
it reduces the average returns from a car of
fruit whe-.i en even 10 per cent of It we pay
out -*1 30 to $1 50 ier box and get absolutely
no ru-turn whatever. And if the decay runs
13 or -0 per cent, that is JuiÂ«t eo much worse.
In part tills dÂ«cay In transit is probably
due to slow service by the railroads and cli
matic extremes through which the fruit passes
en route. But that explanation cannot be ac
cepted as adequate to fully cover the case.
Thtre must in many instances be something
wror.p vrith the fruit before it starts; and^lt
is ui> to the growers and the Department of
Agriculture to find out what the trouble ls.
Fruit crown in a climate like ours, with an
air that i3 pure and dry and notably free from
germs, ought not to decay easily. We are in
clined to think rome of th* decay Is due to
careless handling In picking, hauling and pack
ing. Too much emonasis cannot be placed on
the importance of care in preventing the fruit
from bclr.s bruised or contaminated with dirt
that may contain the germs of decay. Nothing
short or the highest cleanliness and the most
careful handling should be allowed in the mar
keting of a product so, valuable and so perish
able as the orange crop.

the choicest Italian vines. Seven ' hundred
acres have been added on the south, where the
station of Chiantl has been established. There
are 2700 acred in vines and 15<M> are In full
bearing. The yield is not fabulous, but there
are no finer vines or vintage even In Italy.
The colony crushed over 60"JO tons of out
side grapes last year and has ample facilities
for caring for the vintage of 1904.
About liity tons of cream ot tartar are made
yearly and the residue from the pomace la
converted into a valuable fertilizer for the

Stock raising ie one of the moat promising

factors which the observing stockman will ap

factors make this a most promising field for

factor, -viz., direct" and cheap transportation.
There are countless openings hero for men of
industry and energy, whenever a eouthern
outlet Is provided. At present the i mining
campe take all the more -perishable produce we
can supply; the honey, wool, meats and sim
ilar , products are profitably sold in the Jargi
cities.- Our creameries find sale' for their
output, but thus far have not undertaken to

Sugar beets grown in an experimental way

crops. On some tracts as high as S5C0 pounds
of wheat per acre has been grown. While this
is much above the normal, yields of 2000 to
2500 pounds per acre are common.
Potatoes and all forma of garden produce
are extensively grotvn..
It is proverbial that a complete crop failure
in this valley is unknown. "Armies" of in
fcect pests fail to reach us. and as the mows
of the hitrh Sierras are the main dependence
for water, sweeping droughts are impossible.
The valley is not adapted to citrus fruits.
Figs, cotton and tobacco have been grown on
a limited scale, but without a degree of suc
cess to encourage euch culture. Apples, pears,
apricots, peaches, plums, prunes, walnuts,
almonds and all kinds of berries grown here
excite admiration wherever they are displayed,
for their sire as well as flavor. This Is es
pecially true of apples and other large fruits.
Grapes of all kinds are successfully irrown
in all parts of the valley. In the southern
part, especially, are opportunities for this
kind of culture equal to those of any part of
the State.
Agricultural lands are obtainable at prices
which, in comparison with those charged in
many less fertile sections, are very low, rang
ing from *1 25 an acre for Government loca
tions to from $10 to $100 for improved tracts.
Much grood land lies east of the river; that
on the west side is.- however, far greater in
amount and area developed. As this latter ls

the valley, is not. apt to do us Justice.

station and slightly more In. Round Valley.
Owing to this and the dry air, the climate it
mild and healthful.
The Inyo Register devotes much
space to a special description of Inyo
County. Some of the leading facts are
republished here for general informa
tion as follows:
Inyo's aroa, 10,156 square miles; boundaries,
north. Mono County; east, State c~T Nevada;
south, San Bernardino and Kern; west. Fresno
and Tulare. Surface largely mountainous,
with large valleys, which, with the exception
cf Owens Valley, are mostly desert.
Population, census 1900 4377. Bonded debt,
$($0.0<J0. Assessed value. 1003, $2,310,319; tax
rate, l'JO;:, 92 25 per (100.
Nearly all the common minerals and metals
and some that are rare are found in the
county. The desert portion is a veritable
treasure houae of minerals, now in most in
stances lying dormant because of lack of
available transportation. Textbooks credit
Inyo with having a larger variety of minerals
than any other California county, nearly 150
such being known, and others probable. Mil
lions of dollars have been produced from this
pource in years past, the single camp of
Cerro Gordo being credited with $13,000,000
output during the first seven years of its ca
reer. Mines are found, and more or less
worked, in all portions of the county. Add to
the ledges and similar deposits the vast beds
of borax, salt, niter, marble, slate, building
stone, phosphates, etc.. and the unlimited de
posit of soda In the waters of Owens Lake
and now being extracted by evaporation and
we have a lengthy list. Within the county
He deposits extensive enough to supply the
world's markets In several lines, oncfe the prob
lem of cheap transportation is solved.
The Owens Valley extends nearly the length
of the county's western edge. To It alone is
reference made in speaking of agricultural
development, for it contains all the county's
agricultural land and fully nine-tenths^ of the
population. It is the natural supply point for
surrounding mining regions, including the min
eral fields of it* own county, much of Mono
and Esmeralda. counties, and the new camps
in tha Tonopali region.
Owens Valley ls approximately 100 miles
Ions, about fifteÂ«n miles wide at Bishop; is
almost cut In two by a spur of the Sierras
near Fish Springs, south of which it expands
to a width of six to ten miles. It contains
about 500,000 acres of areable land, of which
200.000 acres are now held under patent.
Scarcely one-fifth of this is as yet materially
improved.
The coll is fertile. Along the foothills and
through much of the valley it is sandy with
loam along the low lands. Alkali is found in
this latter soil, but not usually In sufficient
quantity to make the land useless.

Possibilities Give Higher Rank.

California is very much in need of
a good milling wheat that will retain
its properties here. The State Board
of Trade and the University of Cali
fornia are working together on this
problem, and, in view of its import
ance, and of the very great resources
of the National Government, it seems
most fortunate that there is now lo
cated in this State a department farm,
the purpose of which is the solution of
just such problems.
Among the plants which have been
introduced from^abroad is the alfalfa,
which comes to us from Turkestan and
is probably the most valuable plant in
California to-day, the one which prom
ises most to the future prosperity of
the State. The Washington navel
orange was introduced through the De
partment of Agriculture, as were many
of our most valuable fruits.
Among the introductions of the de
partment which are now growing into
great industries are rice culture and
tea culture in the south. Rice has
proved a profitable crop in Louisiana
and Texas and the rice fields are con
stantly growing in extent. Tea plan
tations are also proving successful.
â¢ It is impossible even to mention any
considerable portion of the many evi
dences of the value of this work, and
it is utterly impossible to forecast what
the future may bring forth. Explorers
are working in many portions of the
world and their efforts will undoubt
edly result in vast benefits to agricul
ture and horticulture in America. There
are valuable food and forage plants
without number which may be success
fully and profitably grown in this coun
try and of which we know nothing.
The introduction of plants which may
be profitably grown by American
farmers means the addition of millions
to their wealth. California, by reason
of her inviting conditions, varied to
pography and climate, may be expected
to reap the greatest benefit, even were
the testing gardens located elsewhere,
but Â¦with the gardens situated in a
favored district of this State our tillers
of the soil will . certainly reap even
greater proportionate advantages. The
immediate locality will get the first
and greatest benefit, for there the suc
cesses will be first known and first
used.
bureau which are contributing to-day
to the prosperity of American farmers
are new and improved varieties of
wheat, oats, barley and other grains.
During the past few years the depart
ment has introduced macaroni wheats,
which by reason of adaptability to
semi-arid conditions, have added ap
proximately a million acres to the
wheat-producing area of the United
States and at the same time rendered i
possible the upbuilding of a macaroni i
manufacturing industry. Macaroni
is consumed extensively in this coun
try, the importations in a single year
amounting to 15,000,000 pounds.

The plant introduction garden lately
established by the United States De
partment of Agriculture at Chico, in
Butte County, will probably play an
lmpqrtant part in the tests that will
be made of this and perhaps other
grasses for matting purposes. P. H.
Dorsett, manager of the gardens, has
expressed a great interest in the mat
ter and will take it up direct with the
department, and it is altogether prob
able that a tract of suitable land may
be secured and experiments in culture
conducted under his supervision.
The possibility of Introducing intÂ»
our tule lands a product that will sell
at $60 per ton or at any considerable
portion of such figure is sufficiently
enticing to warrant considerable ex
penditure in investigation. General
Green Is confident that success will
be attained. '

Coghlan feels his loss keenly. For
many years he has been saving his
small earnings to build a little home.
He never intrusted his money to the
banks, but always kept it in his home
and generally took it with him when
he went out. His wife gave the police
a good description of the men who she
believes robbed her husband and a gen
eral round-up of the pickpockets known
to be in town will be made with a view
to having the culprits identified by
their victim and his wife.
John Coghlan, a laborer living at 607
Third street, was robbed yesterday aft
ernoon of 5400 by pickpockets. The
light-fingered gentry, three in number,
made good their escape.
Coghlan and his wife and children
.went to the Cliff House yesterday to
spend the day. With him he had tied
in a leather pouch his entire savings.
He thought the money would be safer
on his person than if left in the house.
The laborer and his family took the
blue car line to the beach. Starting to
return about 4 p. m., he made his way
through a large crowd waiting for seats
on the cars. Three men jostled him. two
of them attracting his attention while
the third deftly went through his
pockets and filched the coveted coin.
Coghlan's wife saw the men acting sus
piciously. When they were seated in
the car she asked her husband if the
money was safe. He felt for the sack,
but it was gone.
With a cry he jumped from the car
and vainly endeavored to catch sight
of the thieves: His noise attracted the
attention of the police at the beach,
who made a search for any well-known
characters in the pickpocket line, but
did not make any arrests. Coghlan
reported the theft to the captain of de
tectives and Detective Thomas Gibson
was detailed on the case.
The result of this careful com
parison of the Chico district with
others of the most favored in this
State is in effect an official indorse
ment of the claims put forth by its
residents in its behalf, and in view of
this fact it is surprising to learn that
j subscriptions have been so solw in
coming in that there Is danger of the
institution being lost.
PRACTICAL BENEFITS.
The great value of the garden, .of
course, is in the benefit to agriculture
and horticulture. This may be best
illustrated by calling attention to
benefits which have already accrued to
American farmers through plant In
troduction. For many years the.de
partment has maintained a staff of
*'arâ 'cultural explorers," who search
the earth for new plans that may
prove of value to the American
farmer.
They are constantly sending in new
seeds and new plants, some of which
prove of value, while others, of course,
prove of no value here. Those which
give promise of developing into valu
able products are carefully propa
gated and in many instances improved
or acclimated by selection and plant
breeding. This work is not confined
to finding new and strange plants, but
new varieties of plants already grown
extensively here are constantly sought
and occasionally the search results in
developing varieties that are a distinct
gain to the producers of this coun
try.
Among the importations of this
This garden is the result of the
! growth in importance of this branch
i of the work of the department. Here
1 tofore new introductions have been
I handled in the department green
; houses and grounds at Washington.
; During recent years it has been the
! custom to delegate to nurserymen and
seedsmen much of the work of trying
I out new importations, but heir work
j has not proved satisfactory. Private
! individuals have in the majority of
i instances found it impossible to give
i to the work of the department that de
gree of time and attention necessary
I to anything like satisfactory results
â¢ and the result has been the decision
j to establish a farm where this may
! all be performed under the direction
j of capable experts in the employ of
; the department.
The selection ' of a site at Chico for
i this important branch carried on by
; the Government is itself the strongest
indorsement ever given to the section
of California in which it has been lo
! cated. ,
The site was not selected until every
Â¦ portion of California that was believed
i to offer anything like suitable advan
1 tages was carefully examined. Several
j months were spent in a close examina
tion of various districts. This was
I conducted by experts who enjoyed
the fullest confidence of the depart
ment officials. One of these was Pro
fessor A. V. Stubenrauch, of the Uni
versity of California.- The other was
P. H. Dorsett. who is now in charge
of the institution. The work of these
gentlemen was systematic and thor
ough. They found several places well
adapted, but by a careful grading, in
which each desired condition was
given its proper value, Chico was
found to be slightly in advance of the
others.
The work of introducing plants and
seeds from foreign countries has been
carried on by the department for a
great many years and many of our
most valuable products have come to
us through this work. There are few
products of farm or orchard but have
in some measure been benefited by the
work of the Department of Agricul
ture, while many of the commonest
grains and grasses as well as fruits
and grapes are direct importations
brought to us through the very work
that will henceforth be carried on at
the Chico garden.
WORK IS IMPORTANT.
The plant introduction garden as a
separate institution is new, though the
work to be carried on there has long
been carried on by the Department of
Agriculture. As its name indicates, it
is the place where seeds and plants
imported from foreign countries will
be introduced and tested. The mis
take has been made of calling it a
"seed farm" and in the minds of some
it has been confounded with the annu
al distribution of seeds through our
representatives in Congress. These
gardens, however, will not be used to
produce seeds for Congressmen to giv*
away to their constituents, but will
serve a vastly more important pur
pose.
The tract selected comprises eighty
acres lying about two miles southeast
of Chico, near Butte Creek. It is as
fine a body of land as can be found in
the State for the successful cultiva
tion of the widest possible variety of
plants. The greater portion of it is
rich, deep loam, which is bordered on
the north by a stretch of what is desig
nated "slough" land, and is heavily
timbered, forming a wind-break. Upon
this tract work has already begun and
many valuable plants are now grow
ing there.
The announcement has just been
made at Chico lhat the plant and pro
duction garden located near that city
a few months ago-, by- the United
States Department of Agriculture may
be lost to thi3 portion of California
through the failure of the people of
the locality to subscribe . sufficient
memey to pay for the land.
This announcement arouses renewed
Interest in the garden and another ef
fcTt is being made to raise the neces
sary funds.. There has been some
criticism of the attitude of the depart
ment in the matter of requiring that
land be donated for the purpose, but
it seems that several other localities
in the State where the garden might
be satisfactorily located stand ready
to dc-nate the necessary land, and the
understanding of <he department at
the time the Chico site was selected
was that equally favorable terms
would be offered there. Whatever may
be the merits, however, of the conten
tion that the Government should buy
the land and pay for it, the fact is
that the Government does not regard
it in that light and the land must be
donated if the institution is to remain
at Chico.
A new effort will be made to raise
the money, aided by the Sacramento
Valley Development Association. Rapid
work will be necessary, as the depart
ment has fixed August 1 as the time
when the matter must be settled, and
o-nly one week remains in which to se
: cure subscriptions amounting to $5000.
EXTENT OF THE GARDEN.
BY W. A. BEARD.
There has been some fear expressed that the
Mexican Government might Interpose obstacles
to the acquisition of the system by the people
through the Reclamation Bureau, but it now
looks as though this would not be the case.
About the only lands in Mexico available for
irrigation are those of the California and Mex
ico Land and Cattle Company and the Cali
fornia Development Company, both composed
of Log Angeles capitalists, and their Interests
are naturally allied with a movement to secure
the completion of the irrigation system on a
strong basis.
What is really the most complicated feature"
of the projected completion of the Bystem by
the Government Is the fact that the 217.000
acres which have been filed on have secured
water stock in mutual companies, based on the
system of the California Development Com
pany, and have paid a large sum of money
for a water right on which the Government has
placed a cloud. The Government is not dis
posed to recognise the payments which have
been made for water stock as giving the hold
ers advantages over the bare land not yet filed
on, while the land owners feel that when It
comes to figuring out a basis of payments for
the completion of the irrigation system they
should not be called on to pay as much as
those who will hereafter file on land and who
have made no payments for water stock.
The reclamation bureau naturally takes
great interest in the proposed development on
the Lower Colorado, for the new system will
not only be the largest worn of the kind ta
this country, but it will take' rank with the
immense lrrisatlon systems built by the Brit
ish Government on the Nile and Ganges rivers,
and probably would remain Tor all time as
one of the three greatest irrigation systems on
earth.
It is expected that when the water users
and tha development company have reached an
agreement, if that agreement reaches the ap-'
proval of the "Reclamation Bureau^ of the In
terior Department, the Government will ad
vance the moi.ey for the purchase of the plant
and for its completion out of the reclamation
fund, the amount to be paid back to the Gov
ernment in ten annual payments without in
terest.
The plan will Include possibly 800,000 acres In
the United States and 300,tXX> acres in Lower
California and Mexico.
While the negotiations have riot reached a
definite conclusion, it is understood that' there
Is good prospect that the water users and
the development company will get together on
a price, which will Include Mexican laud over
Â¦which the irrigation canals have to travel.
The Drice of this will probably be somewhere
between $ l,B<)0. COO and J2.500.C00.
A conference has been in progreA in
Los Angeles that lasted several days,
the purpose of which was to find some
basis upon which the irrigation system
of the 'Imperial Valley may be taken
over by the United States Government
and completed as a part of a compre
hensive plan to cover all lands on the
lower Colorado River, so says the Los
Angeles Herald, which makes also the
following statements relative to the
matter:

raised before the first of August to pay for the land that is required,
the garden may' bo removed to some other locality. There are sev
eral other places in California where the garden might be satisfac
torily located, so writes Secretary Beard,, and the people of such
places stand ready to donate the land. The understanding was that
Chico would provide what land was needed. The Government is not
inclined to buy and pay for the site. . The selected tract embraces
eighty acres, lyln~ about two miles southeast of Chico, near Bntte
Creek. The . Government oflicials found ideal conditions near Chico.
A strong effort will be made to raise the needed $5000 during the
present week. Work has already begun on the site near Chlco and
many valuable plants are growing there. Mr. Beard submits cogent
reasons to show the necessity that Chico shall retain the institution,
a matter in which the entire Sacramento Valley is concerned. The
garden l s destined to play an important part in the agricultural fu
ture of California.

OAKLAND.. July 21.â The Oakland
Wheelmen to-day won the California
Associated Cyclers' trophy fifty-mile re
lay race over the San Leandro triangle
in so close a finish that there was bare
ly four inches between the Oakland
man, R. Williamson, and the New
Century Wheelmen's representative, A.
Trout, at the tape. The race was so
hot that the timers could not make a
comparative difference between the two
leaders. Wheeler of the California
Cycling Club, the third man, was dis
tanced by his two speedy competitors.
â¢ By their victory to-day the Oakland
Wheelmen retain possession of the tro
phy, which they captured last year..
The race was the Oakland Wheel
men's throughout, their men leading in
four of the six relays into which the
fifty-mile course was divided.

Travelers who have valuable Jewelry will be
interested in a recent court decision which
established a precedent regarding the liability
of steamship companies. Frances M. Barnes
eued the owners of the steamship Minnetonka
for the loss of a diamond necklace valued at
$5COO, which was stolen from her stateroom
by a steward. She had asked the eurser of
the steamer to tako it for safekeeping and he
refused to do so. Judge Adams found for the
libelant.
Steamship Must Pay.
The fine weather yesterday attracted a big
crowd of sightseers, who lined the water front
from the Pacific Mall dock way down to
Meiggs wharf. Men, women and children all
joined in the calm delights of the quiet after
noon. They inspected the ships lying along-
Fide the piers, watched the ferry-boats as
they glided emoothly over the blue waters
of the bay and looked with admiration at an
army ot cwlft yachts as the*- sailed gaily
past. It was the largest crowd that has been
on the front since the summer exoduar to the
country began. A surprising feature cf the
day was the absence of the usual contingent
of eccentric orators, fakers and venders of dif
ferent kinds of patent wares that commonly
hold forth on the different* wharves crying in
strenuous tones the merits of their wares or
their creeds. The elimination cf this discord
ant element added greatly to the pleasure of
the day for those who sought respite from
the humdrum of city life In the rest and recre
ation afforded by a quiet stroll along the front.
Â«
Crowds on AVatcr Front.
The largest eteel steamers included in these
figures were the Minnesota, of 20.718 grosÂ»
tons, built at New London. Conn.; the Sahara,
of 57S5 tons, at Ix>raln, O. : the City of At
lanta, of 5433 tons, at Chester, Pa. and the
Martin Mallen, of 4G35 tons, at Cleveland, O.
The wooden Pteam vessels numbered 89, with
a gross tonnage of 0770. Of these ten were
built on the Pacific Coast, having a gross ton
nage of 20S4; fcrty-elght were built In Atlantic
and gulf ports, four on the great lakes anil
the remaining twenty-s=even on Western rivers.
The steel Bteam vessels numbered eight,
with a gross tonnage of 37.75t>. Only one of
those was built on the Pacific Coast and was
of 84 tens gross. Five were built on the At
lantic and the gulf, to curry 27,252 tons, and
the remaining two were built on the great
lakes.
â¢The Bureau of Navigation reports that 137
vessels of 61, CO" gross tons were built In the
United States and officially numbered during
the month of June, 1901. Among these were
forty wooden sailing vessels, of a gross ton
nase of 70S1. Five of these, having a gross
tonnage of 177S, were built on the Pacific
(.'oast, thirty-four were built In Atlantic and

TACOMA, Wash., July 24.â Slavonian
miners started a riot yesterday morn
ing at the Treadwell mines by throw
ing stones at Japanese underground
employes. The Slav miners side with
Russia in the present Oriental war and
have had numerous altercations with
the Japanese outside of working hours.
News of the struggle in the Orient ia
eagerly awaited by each nationality,
which members do not refrain from
poking fun at their opponents when
the news will justify it.
Talcing cognizance of the belligerent
feelings the management of the mines
had warned bqth sides to strictly be
have themselves underground. The
Japanese promptly retaliated yesterday
and war seemed inevitable. Knives
and rocks were freely used and a num
ber were Injured on each side.
Superintendent McDonald armed his
most trusted white miners with re
volvers, at the same time sending for
United States Marshal Shoup at
Juneau, who responded with a posse of
deputies. Armed guards are keeping
watch to prevent another outbreak.

One mishap occurred during the race.
The sloops Mignon and Emma had
rounded Goat Island shoal buoy and
were beating out to Presidio shoal
buoy. While the Emma was on the
starboard tack and the Mignon on the
port tack, the Mignon struck the
Emma with her bowsprit, making a
hole and doing other damage. The
Mignon's bowsprit was snapped off
short.
The actual sailing times of th* first firs
boats were as follows: Ruby, 2 hours 11
minutes and 2S seconds; Emma, 2 hours and 2
minutes; Aeolus, 2 hoars 4 minutes and B2
seconds; Speedwell. 1 hour GS minutes and C3
seconds; Thelma, 2 hours 8 minutes and 33
seconds.

boats crossing the starting line and
twenty-one finishing. About a score
of prizes was awarded, the first five
being taken by the sloops Ruby. Em
ma, Aeolus, Speedwell and Thelma, m
the order named. The start was across
a line drawn from Peninsula Point to
the stakeboat May, thence to and round
Goat Island shoal buoy, leaving It on,
the starboard hand, thence to ana
round Presidio shoal buoy, leaving It
on the starboard hand; thence the
finish across the starting line. The
wind was light at the start and the
finish^ but in the channel there was
a strong breeze with a heavy sea. The
little yawl Klttiwake made excellent
time out to Presidio shoal buoy, but
on the last leg struck a calm spot and
was overhauled by several of the
yachts. A handicap was assigned to
each yacht according to her speed, the
little sloop Vixen receiving the longest
start and Haruoon being the scratch
boat. Neither finished.

Battle Delays the Game.
The morning conter was - A slug
ping match and both teams took turns
a.t hammering the ball around the lot.
Oakland hit just a little harder and
managed to win out in the ninth
inning. Then the Seattle players tried
to delay the game in every possible
manner so the score would revert back
to the eighth inning and the game
would be a tie. Clay Hawbaker,
president of the Oakland club, made a
complaint to President Bert of the
league and the latter announced that
he would fine the Seattle team heavily
should this happen again. ThÂ« score:

The open stake at Union Coursing
Park yesterday was captured by J.
Dtnnis* Racing Auto. The Refefee ran
against him in the deciding course.
These two hounds were the whole show
and some of the sideshows of the
course. The consolation stake went to
Rose of Gold after a neck-and-neck
dash with Rapid Water. It was a
mournful seance for the pikers, as only
a half dozen short ends got the coin.
Texas Jim at 3 to 1 was the biggest
haul. He scooted away from Honest
John and got the price of sinkers for
numerous short-end takers. The jacks
were strong except in few instances.

Alameda Eleven Falls to Capture All
Opponents' Wickets Before the
I Call of Time.
The match played yesterday on the
Alameda ground between the Pacific
and Alameda teams ended in a fortun
ate draw for the Pacific club, whose
representatives' had one wicket to fall
and 55 runs to make to win when
stumps were drawn. The Alameda
team went to the wicket first and com
piled the respectable total of ITS runs,
the chief contributors being F. J. Croll
(41). H. Bird (40) and G. Croll (27).
Casidy proved the most effective of the
Pacific howlers, taking 4 wickets for
31 runs.
"When the Pacifies went in they had
to make 177 runs to secure a win or
play out time to get a draw. The first
three batsmen did well, scoring 78
runs, but Petherick and Bowly, who
are generally run-getters, scored only
1 between them. Casidy, however, kept
up his wicket and with Altman was
not out when time was called. F.
Croll and Harold "Ward proved the
most deadly of the Alameda bowlers,
the former taking 4 wickets for 3$ runs
and the latter 3 for 42. The full de
tails follow:

Not until the seventh did the Tigers
get a semblance of a hit. Then the
two knocked out went for naught.
Third base was their limit. Overall
was Ditching hard, but the Browns
landed upon him. In the eighth
Eagan whacked out a hit that took
him to second. On Lynch's out he went
to third and Hogan's hit to center
brought him home.
In the tenth, Thielman slew the first
two batters and the third skied to
Drtnnan. McLaughlin singled and
went to second on Eagan's sacrifice.
Castro hid the ball and McLaughlin
supped from the cushion to be caught
napping. Score:

The fir*t haif of the baseball season I
pas^d into history yesterday alter- j
noon, and Mike Fishers Tacoma Tigers j
emerjed from the fray with the title of j
chami :cr.s for the time being. It was a
â¢ueil earned victory and one that
brought surprise to a vast army of i
Jans. Seattle finished a good second. I
as 'a as expected. On Tuesday the sec- j
cod na!f of the season will begin. San J
Francisco and Seattle will mix it in
Oakland. Oakland at Los Angeles and
Iicoma a.t Portland.
The victorious potion was evenly
C'Â»Â«ait out yesterday. Oakland shone
1'fightJy on the home diamond in the
rnurningr. ar.d Seattle rallied in the ,
sixth inning at Recreation Park, bat
ting in four runs and breaking the i
fame arÂ»- Scoresâ Morning game. Oak- J
lar.u 1L Seattle 7; afternoon game,
Seattle 6. Oakland 4.
Oakland was leading 3 to 0 in the lat
ter struggle when the sixth inning was j
st hand. Then young Hall opentd up j
Â¦*-ith a scratch hit and Van Haltren
cleared the riffht field fence with the
bail, tying; urÂ» the result. This set the
EBUltitade wild, and the cheers did not
even subside then, for Seattle was not
ihioug-h sticking.
Williams was given a life on Schla
tiey's error and Frisk sent him around
to third on a safe drive, going to sec
ond h:rr.Â«=elf on the throw. When Smith
swung through to left field they both
came in, and this final hit simply
turned the tide of victory.
Oakland did its best work in the first
two rounds. Hall started off wrong.
Me allowed Ganley and Graham hits j
uxd erred on Dunleavy's bunt, letting i
a run in. Then he hit Schlafiey, filling j
u? th* bases, with no one out. It looked
like an avalanche cf runs for Oakland.
but Dunleavy was doubled up at second
urnen Devertaux flew to Van Haltren, j
and this dummy work on Dun's part
i;robably cost Oakland the game.
Oakland was there again in the sec- j
c nÂ»i round with two more. Byrnes hit ,
and Buchanan landed on an error, j
â¢?^ndinj? Byrnes to third. Ganley placed t
a double out to center, scoring- Byrnes i
and sending Buchanan to third. He
himself slid over the bag and was out.
A r-assed ball then happened and
Buchanan arrived. .
Oakland had a chance to tie the score
in the ninth inning. Dunleavy doubled
to * the score board and Schlafiey
v alked. There were two out at the
time ar.d Schlafiey went down to sec
ond. While sliding to the base he
knocked Mohler down. Umpire McCar
thy oxarr.ir.ed the mass of arms and
U5S and finally declared Schlafiey out.

ond class â Horace Mann beat Fred Ad&sis, ft-4,
6-4. 6-3.
The local tennis player3 were busily
engaged in tc/urnament play yester
day. On the California Club courts a
handicap doubles tournament for the
Directors' Cups waa the feature. At
the park, the cracka met in a class
singles tournament. The third and
fourth classes were commenced and
will be finished next Sunday. The see
ond class was finished and resulted la
a victory for Horace Mann. In the
first class, R. X. Whitney and Georgd
Baker were the contestants in the
finals. Baker won the first two s<its
but the third, which was an exceed
ingly long one, went to Whitney. The
latter wa^ tired out and the remain
ing sets will be played next Sunday.
In the semi-finals of the first class
Whitney beat Carl Gardner easily, the
score being 6-3, 6-3. The other semi
final match between Clarence Griffin
and Baker was interesting and closely
contested. Griffin won the first set
but his more experienced opponent
steadied down and won the next two
by a small margin.
In the finals, Whitney tired in thÂ«
first set, which he lost. 6-4. In tha
second set he did not exert himself
and won only two games. The third
set was close, first one in the lead and
then the other. At no time waa either
mere than one game ahead. Whitney
did some clever driving and won by a
score of 11-9. Neither player took any
chances at the net and consequently
some long ralleys resulted.
In the second class, Fred Adams was
no match for Horace Mann. The IatÂ»
ter won three straight sets. Mann
played a careful game and his clever
cuts were too much for his opponent.
The score waa 6-4, 8-4, 6-2.
Eight teams entered the California
Club tournament. None of the first
class cracks entered and some liberal
handicaps were given. A new team
composed of George Janes and Her
bert Long carried off the trophies. la
the finals they met Harry Rolfe and
Chester Smith c-n even terma. Tha
former won in straights, but the match
was by do means one-sided. In the
first two sets Long and Janes did some
great driving. Long handled lobs bet
ter than usual and the lobbing game
of his opponents Just suited him. Smith
and Rolfe had a good lead in the third
set but lost after sixteen games had
been played.
In the first round, Janes and Long
had a narrow escape. Nourse and
Kuehn had many chances to win both
sets but luck was not with them.. Al
den Ames and W. G. Knowlton made
a good showing for new men. They
reached the semi-finals and made a
good showing against Long and Janes.
The matches resulted as follows:

Dr. Benjamin Apple, the Hayes Val
ley Club's physician, examined Battling
yesterday and found him to be iu per
fect condition. The doctor says he is a
fine specimen of humanity and is built
like an ox. ,
Yesterday morning a baseball game
was played between two picked teams.
Nelson captained one nine and Teddy
Murphy the other. In the third Inning
Nelson was at the bat and Frank Neu
house, r>Stcher for the other side, threw
the ball and hit Battling on the head.
The ball turned to one side and was re
turned to Frank, who found that it had
been knocked loosided. Nelson says he
thought his head was hard, but he had
no idea that it would bend a baseball.
Several hundred admirers of Eddie
Hanlon made their way to his training
quarters at Croll's Gardens, Alameda,
yesterday afternoon to observe the lit
tle fighter in action with his sparring
mates. Hanlon came into' his large
gymnasium at 3:30 o'clock and boxed
four rounds with Toby Irwin and Fred
Landers.
Eddie took on Toby for the first two
periods and stood up straight in deliv
ering: and receiving punches. Irwin's
left kept Hanlon stepping about lively
to keeD out of range, but Toby did not
have everything his own way when
Eddie cut loose. In his two rounds with
Landers Hanlon assumed his charac
teristic crouch, and his blocking with
his arms was a feature of the bout. In
the last round Eddie went after Fred
and there was a hammer-and-tongs
mixup that called forth the applause
of the big crowd present.
In the morning Hanlon rested, not
even doing any roadwork. He is now
and has been for a week practically
at the weight at which he js to meet
Battling Nelson, 130 pounds, and Train
er McDonald does not believe that it
would be prudent to have his charge
do any more exercising than that which
is necessary to keep him on edge.
About 150 people crowded "Smiling"
Metzner's tavern at Larkspur yester
day to watch Battling Nelson work for
his coming bout with Eddie Hanlon.
Battling denned the mitts and went
three rounds each with Frank Rafael
and Frank Xeuhause. The latter bout
was exceptionally fast and the end of
the third round found Neuhouse very
groggy.
There will be four more games played
between the two clubs this season, the
next to come off in San Mateo August 7.
In the last score San Francisco won by
Chambers ! passing the ball to Taylor,
Taylor to Scanlan, Scanlan to Renwick.
then lost to Lynch, recovered by Tay
lor, who passed it to Scanlan again,
lost to Lynch, stolen by Scanlan, who
drove it into the goal. W. Blackwood,
the president of the Lacrosse Associa
tion, who was present, stated that
many of the players on the field in that
game would rank with the crack teams
of Canada.
The San Francisco and San Mateo la
crosse clubs crossed sticks yesterday
afternoon in a warmly contested game
at the Presidio grounds. It was In a
measure a crucial game, and the~"vlc
tory of the home team by a score of 10
to 4 makes its members feel like cham
pions. This is the first time the San
Mateos have played here since they de
feated the crack players of Los An
geles, who were practically the cham
pions of the State. There waa much
surprise at the San Franciscos' big
score, but they won only by the hard
est work, as Lynch, Sisson, Pease and
Tobin fought the home team every Inch
of the ground. But the playing of Dar
ragh, McAteer, Scanlan, Peterson and
Taylor was almost faultless and their
team only could win.
The San Francisco team was as fol
lows: Delcescaux, McQuade, Barclay,
De Villeas, Peterson. Renwick. Cham
bers. Taylor, McCarthy, Darragh, Scan
lan and McAteer. The members of the
San Mateo club are Tobin. Degan,
Dunn, Lyons, Sisson. McLelland. Gllll
gan, G. and J. "Wilson, Lynch, Hughes
and Pease. The referee waa R. R.
I'Hommedieu.
The game opened with first score for
San Francisco and the two following
for San Mateo. Then the home team
and next the visitors. The Friscos then
tcok six straight scores, followed by
one for the San Mateos. then the last
two went to the San Franciscos. Mc-
Ateer made the most score plays, fol
lowed by Taylor and Scanlan. For the
visitors Lynch and Hughes drove the
ball into their opponents' goal. Dar
ragh was the coolest and most rapid
runner on the field, the ball appearing
to fall into his net constantly.
Tobin made an excellent goalkeeper
and saved the score many times by
checking the ball when It was driving
straight home. Taylor and Peterson
always seemed" to be in the right place,
and Dr. Sisson did splendid- work for
his team. Often a hot fight would take
place right at the entrance to the goal,
when a lucky and skillful defense
would send it back to the other side of
the field.

The scores follow:
A meeting of the California Schuet
zen Club will be held on Tuesday next
and, as many members have expressed
a desire for the formation of a coast
bund, no doubt a strong committee will
be appointed to represent that organ
ization at the preliminary meetings.
The California Schuetzen Club won the
Centennial cup in Philadelphia In 1876
against competitors from all over the
world, and included in its membership
many of the best riflemen who appear
on the ranges. When last heard from
the Sacramento-Helvetia Rifle Club
was strongly in favor of a Pacific
Coast Schuetzen Bund and will easerly
take proceedings to have their mem
bers represented - on the organizing
committee. \.
A special meeting was held yesterday
at Shell Mound Park by the Germania
Schuetzen Club, at which it was unan
imously decided to appoint a commit
tee to act In conjunction with other
clubs for the early formation of the
bund. Herman Huber, Charles F.
Thierbach and Clarence M. Henderson
were appointed a committee of three.
At the last meeting of the San Fran
cisco Schuetzen Vereln, Captain Henry
Stelling, Kaufman Wertheim and Lieu
tenant Henry Meyer were appointed
and instructed to do everything In their
power to further the interests of the
bund. It will be seen that the mem
bers of the committees so far appointed
are enthusiastic riflemen and will with
out doubt do their utmost In the mat
ter.
Great interest is being manifested by
the riflemen of the Pacific Coast in
reference to the formation of a Pacific
Coast Shooting Bund. Negotiations are
under way and committees are being
appointed by the different rifle clubs
to perfect arrangements for a success
ful launching of the bund.
The attendance of marksmen at Shell
Mound Park yesterday was very large.
The weather conditions were favorable
to good marksmanship, consequently
line average scores was the result. A
large number of enthusiasts are at
present in the mountains of Mendocino
and Sonoma counties, pursuing the
elusive buck, therefore the names of
many well-known marksmen will not
be lound among the competitors at
the ritle range.
The organizations participating were
Knights of the Red Branch, Company
A Veteran Reserve, Golden Gate Rifle
and Pistol Club, Germania Schuetzen
Club, San Francisco Schuetzen Venein,
Norddeutscher Schuetzen Club, Red
Men's Shooting Company and Shell
Mound Pistol and Rifle Club.
At Ingleside Coursing Park yesterday
an unusually large crowd saw J. Man
ning's Dore?n defeat W. Creamer's Lily
Wright in three straight courses in
their match race. Jn the first course,
with the betting even and floods of
mouey going into the boxes, the crowd
saw one of the most exciting courses
ever run on a sward. At four different
stages of the course the kill for either
dog would have scored a win. First one
dog held the advantage of a point and
then the other until finally Doreen
killed the hare, which gained her the
flag. Doreen won the next two courses
handily. The betting was even on the
first two trials, but in the third the
winner was made a 5 to 3 favorite.
The talent was right in many, in
stances during the day. They backed
Lost Chord, ttie winner of the Class
stake, in his races. They stayed with
Sunny South in the Reserve stake and
he brought home the long end of the
purse. Both the winner of the Class
and Reserve stakes ran in brilliant
form and won their courses in decisive
fashion. Following are the results

The memorial service at Grace
Church for the late Rev. Robert
Chester Foute yesterday morning was
attended by a large assemblage.
The sermon by the Rev. David J.
Evans was impressive and the sacred
music specially selected by William H.
Holt, the organist, from the numbers
that were very dear to the late rector,
was beautifully rendered by Grace
Church choir, augmented by several
who had in many years ago sung in the
church as choristers.
The last service conducted by the la
mented rector* was on Sunday morning.
July 12, 1903, and the first lesson was
Gen. 49, ending with that prophetic
"And when -Jacob had made an end
of commanding his sons, he gathered
up his feet into the bed and yielded up
the ghost, and was gathered unto his
people."
For his memorial sermon the Rev.
Mr. Evans took that same verse for his
text and said in part: -.
Tlie conception of such a service as this,
which enriches our customary devotions with
the personal element of a hallowed memory,
does not need apology or explanation.
In every thoughtful man's life there are
days and places linked with dear memories
and fragrant with happy associations, and
it Is woe unto us if we forget their sacred
nesd.
A twelve-month has gone by. alas! how
quickly gone, since you were bereaved as In
the twinkling of an eye of the good and true
man who for two-thirds of a generation had
been your minister in holy things.
For twenty years with strong voice ne pro
claimed the way of ealvatlcn In this pulpit.
Your Joys and sorrows he had shared, and
with tha most sacred moments in the lives of
very many of you he had been Intimately iden
tified as Chrtsfs true minister must always
be. And there is ma>:v a one before me at
this moment who. whin stricken sore, had
beea soothed and solaced by his words of sym
pathy. There are many here who would tes
tify. If It were necessary, and exclaim. "I
was In trouble and he helped me."
' You have a vision of him at this moment,
many of you. speaking words of comfort anfl
encourngement to dear ones of your own In
their last sickness. You can hear him bid
them be of good cheer as he points them to
the green and smiling pastures en the other
side of the dark river. <i % Â¦'- .
To many of you In times of perplexity and
embarrassment he supplied counsel and h.eav
cnlv advice, for he was not merely a good
man. proficient In the immediate fifties of his
ministerial office, but he was also a man of
sound judgment, clear brain and strong intel
lect on whose advice in dealing with life's
thorny problems you could rely.
He was devoted soul and body to the in
terests of this church, working for It nlsht
and day. In season and out of season. . with
indefatigable energy and consuming zeal.

David J. Evans -Remembers
Late Dr. Robert C. Foute
If you happen to take in "A Gentle
man of France" this week at the Grand
Opera-house, don't leave until the fifth
scene is over. The impatiently inclined
will need the tip. Even yesterday aft
ernoon's audience, the most leisurely of
the wetk, swatted protesting fingers. at
the long waits. Served hot, the roman
tic drama may persuade; otherwise, it
is about as inviting as cold mutton
gravy. "A Gentleman of France" will
be remembered as the most usual of
romances, with its distressed damsels,
abductions, kings and cavaliers and
wonderful combats. But set jigging on
its wayâ one, two, three, thrust! one,
two, fTiret-, guard! â without pause. -or
stay, and the bustle and dash ' carry
the thing. Half-past four yesterday aft
ernoon found "A Gentleman of France"
full fifteen minutes from the end of the
second act.
Given s*Â»eed the performance would
go. Mr. Neill has the part of -De Mar
sac, and -though sleeny to fit the gen
eral pace at first, fires up nobly Inthe
combat scene. And 'tis a gay combat.
Like the tailor in Grimm's, the .hero
kills "seven at a blow." Alone he does
it. That is, s not quite alone. The hero
ine finished one man with a sort of sofa
cushion -and spits another of the
wounded with a borrowed sword. She
has him on end, as on a toasting fork,
as the scene goes down. But 'tis a good
fight. The house howled joyously as
one spitted villain after another tum
bled down the~"staircase. I counted, I
think, eight curtain recalls for the tri
umphant De Marsac.
Miss Edythe Chapman is the heroine,
and, as usual, earnest and charming as
Mile, de la Vire. A performance distin
guished by happy buoyancy and' gayely
Is Mr. Bowles' Henry of Navarre, that
is also exceptionally effective from the
picturesque side. John W. Burton is

particular distinction. The play. is pret

fame and SIgnor Abramoff she" ap

"Faust."- Â¦ " .-:%;/-â¢ \ : . '
Nobody could get enough of her and
she was compelled -to answer thrÂ§e en

sponse to the thunderous applause. She
sings with wonderful clarity and sweet

possesses an amazing amount of mag
netism. . She. was happy over her re
ception and .the audience was Â¦ glad to
see and hear her. Russo as Faust and
Abramoff asMophlstoples, respectively,
sang splendidly and contributed :their
full share to Miss Decker's . triumph.
Another tremendous in another

somewhat daring disrobing act- in the
beginning and then twistsand twirls on
the bar in an extraordinarily graceful

To the lovers of fistic art and melo
dramatic excitement a visit to
the California Theater this week
will prove entertaining. In the
first act the tramp who has
"Just struck town" fights the first
old man. the character comedian, and
the villain. After that there are fights
scattered throughout the remainder of
thÂ«Â« play, culminating in a crand cli
max, when Jo Podesta and Charles
Augustus, both of local fame, tamely
attempt to damage each other's beauty
amidst a chorus- of*, "ohs" from the
feminine portion of the house. Of
course-there was some acting, but the
chief features were the flights. Along
with the fls.tic encounters one or two
thrilling rescues were thrown in.
Harry Todd, as : the acrobatic and
ever hungry thirst-ridden tramp, has
about the only nart in the piece. He
handles it very well. Lloyd Ingraham,
as the town marshal, is entirely satis
factory. Barring the entire absence of
a Swedish dialect. Theresa Belmont
Waters gives a good performance of
the Swedish girl. Baby. Martine proves
a precocious child and .shows clever

Well-Known Superintendent of the
Mission-Street Division Is Slated
for Retirement.
It was learned yesterday from a re
liable source that Charles B. Kitch.
superintendent of the Mission-street
division of the United Railroads, is
soon to be retired. Rumor has it that
this change will be followed by sev
eral more on the lines of the street
railway corporation. Kitch's retire
ment will come as a surprise to many,
for he has been connected with the
local street railway system for many
years and was regarded as a very cap
able man. General Manager Chapman
has refused to confirm the report of
Kitch's retirement, but the latter has
informed several of his friends that hr
is s.oon to leave the employ of the
corporation.

Two Men Arc Chased by Policeman,
Who Fires in the Air, and
.One Surrenders.
John Alfasis, a fisherman from Be
nicia, reported to Policeman Bruce
early yesterday morning that while he
was turning the corner of Third and
Bryant streets two men approached
him. One had a revolver in his hand
and pointed it at him, ordering him to
throw up his hands. Alfasis shouted
for help when he saw the second man
sneaking up behind him and the two
assailants ran away. , *
Alfasis accompanied Bruce in quest
of the would-be robbers. At the cor
ner of Bryant and Ritch streets Al
fasis pointed to two men as those who
attempted to hold him up. They fled
along Zoe street. Bruce started in
pursuit. He called upon them to halt,
but they ran the faster and he lired
two shots in the air to intimidate
them. One of them, John Chodrick, a
riveter, took refuge in a doorway.
Bruce covered ! him with his revolver
and the fugitive surrendered. The
other man escaped. Chodrick was
taken to the City Prison, where a
charge of assault to commit robbery
was booked against him. Xo weapon
was found upon him.
ATTEMPT TO HOLD UP
VISITOR FROM BEXICIA
JÂ»HYSICIAX IS HELD
â¢FOR AIDING A SUICIDE
MATTOON. II... July 24. â John P.
Lilly, editor of the Sullivan Herald,
committed suicide yesterday at his
home in this city by taking morphine;
Â¦which he had bought from Dr. Hardin.
The Coroner's jury found that Hardin
-was an accessory before the fact and
5ield him in $5000 bonds to the Grand
Jury.
Policeman Nicholas Baculich. one of
the biggest men on the force, by his
presence of mind and bravery yester^
day saved the life of Edward Nelson.
Nelson is a diiver for the Presidio and
Ferries Railroad, piloting the cars from
the end of the cable line at Montgom
ery avenue to the ferry.
Yesterday afternoon shortly after 4
o'clock Nelson was hitching his horses
to the car preparatory' to driving to the
ferry. A sprinkling wagon was passing
at the time and a quantity of water
sprayed over the car and on the legs
of the horses. They became frightened
and started to run down Washington
street. Nelson hung to the reins in an
endeavor to arrest the frightened ani
mals. His arm became entangled in the
lines and he was dragged over the
rough cobbles for a distance of a hun
dred yards.
The horses gained speed and death
seemed almost certain for the unfortu
nate driver. Policeman Baculich saw
the accident and ran to intercept the
team. He seized the bridle of one of
the horses and threw his 275 pounds
against the most frenzied of the ani
mal?. JIe was lifted from his feet, but
hung on and finally brought the horses
to a stpp.
Nelson was picked up by some car
ir.en and the policeman. He was terri
tly bruised and cut from contact with
the rough stones. He refused to go to
the hospital and .was sent to his home,
â¢where he will be confined to his bed
for several days. Baculich's hand was
badly sprained, but he was otherwise
uninjured. He modestly refrained from
tolling his fellow officers of his brav
ery, but the story leaked out, and when
Jt became generally known he was the
recipient of many congratulations.
Another day has been spent in fruit
less. deliberations by the jury in the
'Eppinger case and the interested par
ties are beginning to show signs of the
strain. The jurors themselves show the
least signs of worry. They walked from
their quarters in the Palace Hotel to
the juryroom yesterday morning look-
Ing more as if they were on their way
to a picnic than to enter into delibera
tions concerning the liberty of one of
their fellow-citizens. After being locked
up in the juryroom no communication
was received from them until 12:30,
when, In answer to a*summons, a dep
uty sheriff opened the door and received
a message brief but suggestive. It was
simply, "We are hungry." The deputy
sheriffs' were hungry also and sympa
thized with the twelve talesmen, who
were at once escorted to the Palace
Hotel. They did not return until 2
o'clock and from that hour until 5
not a word was heard from them. At
5 Judge Lawlor telephoned, saying that
he would not return and that the
jurors might be taken back to their
quarters in the Palace and would not
be expected to resume deliberations un
til-10 o'clock this morning.
Jaeob Eppinger is still a prisoner in
Judge Cook's chambers. He goes out to
his meals, escorted by his son Joe and
an attache of the Sheriff's office. While
outside the walls of the Hall of Justice
the aged defendant steps as nimbly as
in the halcyon days when he was one
of the rulers of the grain market. Re
ports from the extemporized prison,
however, are to the effect that he has
not slept. since the jury went out. and
that spasms due to weakness of the
heart and nervous strain are frequent:
His sons, Joseph and Herman, are con
stantly by his side. Friends and rela
tives pay frequent visits to his quar
ters. Attorneys Ach, Dunne and Short
ridge spend, considerable time in the
hall yesterday and did whatever they
could to encourage their client.
There were rumors yesterday to the
effect that the jury stood ten for con
viction and two for acquittal. Just
before the jurors were led back to their
hotel rumor had it that the jury stood
eleven to one. There was much sdccu
lation regarding the identity of the
one who was -holdinp out. The ex
pense of the trial thus far. including
board, meals and fees for the jurors
and mileage and fees for the witnesses,
has been enormous.

MISS XO. S9G3 LOST A DIAMOND
It must be an engagement rinj?. as it
was found in the glove of the left hand,
in the third finger.
i Joe Rosenberg, the Market-street hab-
I crdasher. kept open three hours aftor
, closing time last Saturday evening, but
j waited in vain, for the fair claimant
\ failed to make an appearance. â¢
- Can it.be that she no longer cares and
that her engagement has been thrown
aside likft the "old gauntlets that were
brought in to bo cleaned?
The rufe of this store is that when
ever any one. finds an article which no
body claims, it goes to the finder. Miss
HafTenon will be the lucky one if nobody
calls. She says she would rather see the
i owner have it. but would make no ob-
I jectipn to having such a beautiful dia
! mono, but would not like to wear it on
I her finger, so she is making plans to
! have a fine time in vacation on it.
] Should the owner call her hopes will be
blasted. It's a beautiful ring, which no
| woman could help admiring. It must
! have belonged to some beautiful unraar
! ried woman, as them wasn't any wed
i ding ring to guard it. or it could not
. have slipped off. So they are wondering
i and pondering, yet no one comes to
I claim It.
Because he had a quarrel with his
young: wife on Thursday Edward J.
Morris, known among: his political
friends as "Teddy," commited suicide
in their roms at SOI Ellis street with
carbon-monoxide. The body was not
discovered till yesterday afternoon.
Morris' mother died about a year
ago, leaving a valuable estate in the
neighborhood of Geary and William
! streets. Last March he married
j Theresa Sharkey, a sister of Miles A.
Sharkey. 451 Bryant street. They had
a quarrel last Thursday and Mrs. Mor
i ris went to the house* of a friend, Mrs.
Donnelly. 613^2 Eddy street. She stop
i ped there all night, and next day went
i to her brother's house".
| On Saturday night Sharkey ques
tioned her as to why she was staying
away from her husband. After some
persuasion she told him they had
j quarreled on Thursday and when she
â¢ returned to their rooms she found
| the door locked. She complained to
! a policeman and he advised her to
break open the door. She was afraid
to do that and returned to her broth
er's house. She begged her brother
to call upon her husband and en
deavor to patch up their quarrel.
Yesterday afternoon Sharkey and
Mrs. Morris started out on their mis
sion of reconciliation. Sharkey went to
801 Ellis street, and Mrs. Morris went
j to her friend, Mrs. Donelly, to await
I developments. Sharkey found the
i door locked and became alarmed
; when he smelled gas. He notified the
j police and Corporal Eastman arrived
j upon the scene and broke in the door.
' The dead body of Morris was discov
! ered fully dressed stretched out on the
! bed. There was a tube in his mouth
and the other end was attached to the
open gas jet. From the condition of
the body death must have occurred on
' Thursday. The landlady smelled gas
fsince Thursday, but thought it came
from a defective gas stove.
The Morgue was notified, but at the
request of the distracted young wife
?nd her brother Chief Deputy Mc
i Cormick allowed the body to be re
i moved to an undertaker's. Morris
j was about 45 years ,of age. Shortly
j after his mother's death his sister
j Marj- sued him for S3000 forattend
j ance upon their mother during her ill
ness, but she lost the suit.
