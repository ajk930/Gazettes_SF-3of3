~: â¢ The Legion Â¦ came : out - t next morning
and pitched, camp in a woodland of oak
arid sugar "trees," where was to be voiced
a patriotic welcome by a "-greats editor,
a great orator, and young i. Crittenden.
.Before noon. . company - streets i.were
laid out arid lined with tents and, when
the first ' buggies ; and- rockaways began
to. roll In from the country, every boy-
: '-"Thinkyit over very carefully,- then
pleaseâfor. my sake." Her voice trexn
.bled, and, with a /pang. Crittenden
thought of the suffering she had known
from one, war. ,. Basil's way was. clear,
and he could never ask the. boy. to give
up to him because he was the elder.
Was it fair' to brave mother for him to
gq, too^-was it right?
"Yes, v mother;" he said, soberly.
suade him-lf he thinks -It Is his duty,"
she added, so solemnly that silence fell
upon the three, and with a smothered
"good Lawd,'-' at the door, Ben hurried
again into v the kitchen.
-. "Both them boys was a-goln' off, to
gt killed! an', ole Miss. Rachel not sayln'
one wjid to keep 'em backâ not a wud."
After breakfast .the boy hurried. out
and, as Crlttanden rose, the mother,
w-ho pretended to" be arranging silver
at the old sideboard, spoke with her
back to him.' V
> \ "Think it over. son. / 1 can't see that
'you should -go, but if you : think you
ought,' I- shall have nothing to say.
Have you made up your mind?"
: Crittenden 'hesitated.
; "Not qujte." 'â¢ I â¢
In 'the center of the woodland was' a
big" auditorium, where the- speaking
was to take" place. After the orators
were done, there was to be a* regimental
review in the bluesrass pasture in front
of historic Ashland. It was .it the col
onel's tent, where Crittenden went to
pay his respects, that he found Judith
Page, and 'he stopped for a moment
under an oak. taking in the gay party
of women and officers who sat' and
stood about the entrance. In the center
of the group stood a lleutenan: in the'
blue of a regular and with the crossed
sabers of a cavalryman on his neck
band, and-the number "of his regiment.
-The girl was. talking to the gallant old
colonel with her back to Crittenden, but
he would: rave known -her had he seen
but an arm*; a shoulder, the poise of her
head, a' single pgesture-^a little, fuller,
perhaps, *!ut graceful, round and slen
der, as was the throat. The hair was a
trifle darker/ he thought, but brown
still, and as rich With gold as autumn
sunlight, r The â¢ rkoflle was in outline
nowâ It was rhore*cleanly cut than ever.
The face was a little older, but still're
markably girlish' in spite of its maturer
strength; and as she turned "to answer
his look, he kept on unconsciously re
affirming to his memory the broad brow
and : deep! clear, eyes,.- even, while his
hand was reaching for the brim of his
hat. She showed only gracious surprise
soldier was brushed and burnished to
defy .the stare of inspection and to quite
dazzle* the eye of masculine envy"or
feminine admiration. . ".*-', 'Â¦"
The train slackened speed and
stopped. There was his . horseâRain
crowâand his buggy .waiting, for him
when he stepped from the platform;
and, as he went forward with his fish
ing tackle, a livery-stable boy sprang
out of the buggy .and went to â¢ the
horse's head.
"Bob lef* yo* hoss In town las' night,
Mustuh Crittenden," he said. "Miss
Rachel said yestiddy she jes kntiwed

Crittenden smiled â it w.as one of his

wound that had caused his . father's
death! long after the war arid Just be
. fprje the boy was born. The hilt wa3
tarnished, and when he caught it and '

and stuck fast. Some one stepped, on

"Hold 6n there, little brother."

"I'n\ the first born, you know," added
Crittenden, still smiling, and the lad
stretched the saber out to him, repeat

The older. brother did not answer; but
turned, without taking the weapon, and
. walked to the door and back again. â¢ ,[ '. .

"Me? Oh, I. have to go." said the
boy solemnly and with great dignity,
as though the matter were â¢ quite be
yond, the pale of discussion. "
"You, do?" . . *
v "Yes; the. Legion is going."
"Only the members who volunteer;
nobody, has to go." â¢
"Don't.they?" said the lad, indlgnant-
I ly. "Well, If I had a son who belonged

, "Why, Judge rage Baid it; that's

"Howdy, Ole.Cap'n." Crittenden had
beeri "Ole Captain" with the servantsâ
since the death of "Ole. ' Master," his

.The eyes, which "were dreamy, kindly,

glow of c6ncentr.at|on : : And pver 'the
rather reckless -cast of his 'features
lay at once the' shadow of suffering
and the light of a great tenderness.
Slowly, a- little, hardness came into his
eyes and a littles bitterness, about his
mouth; His upper lip curved in upon
.his teeth with' self-scorn â for he had
had little cause.to.be pleased with

arid :his . i eyes showed now how

.now" and was shining through the tops
of the treesjn the lovely woodland into
which Crittenden turned, and through
which a road of brown creeksand ran
to thepasture beyona and through .that
to the long avenue of locusts, up which
the noble portico of his 'old homestead,
Canewood, . -was visible among cedars
and firs arid, old, forest trees. His mother
was not up , yet-r-the shutters of., her
window were still closedâ but -the ser
vants were astir and busy. He could
see men and plow horses on their
way to the fields; and", that far away,
â¢he could hear the sound of old-Eph
raim's; ax at the woodpile, the noises
around the barn and cowpens, and old
.Aunt Kezlah singing a hymn in the
kitchen, the old wailing cry. of; the
â¢mother slave. Â¦^:.>
"Oh I wonder whur my baby's ; done

The song stopped, a negro boy sprang
out the kitchen door and ran for the

ter, is settled now by the sword. The
constitution left the question open, but
.it Is. written there now In letters of
blood. We' have given' our -word that
they shall stand; and remember it is
the word of gentlemen and binding on
their sons. There have been those In
the North who have doubted that word;
there have been those" .in the South
who have given cause ror doubt; and
this may be true for a long time. But
if ever the time comes to. test that
word, do you be the first to prove It.
You will fight for your nagâ mine now
as well* as yours â just as sincerely as
I fought against it." And these words,
said Crittenden, in a trembling voice,
the brave gentleman' spoke again on his
deathbed; and . now, as x fce looked
around on the fearless 1 young faces
about. him, lie, had no need to fear that
they were spoken in vain. *
And so the time was come for the
South toprove its loyaltyâ not to itself,
nor to the North, but to the world.

Page. The lieutenant of regulars was
standing on the edge of the crow'd, and
to his right was Grafton, also'standing,
with hjs hat under hts armâ idly curi
ous. But it was to his mother that he
spoke and, steadfastly, he saw her
strong, gentle face even when he was
looking far over her head, and he knew
that she knew that he" was arguing- the
point then and there between them.
It was. he said, ihe ffrst war of Its
kind in history. It marked, ah epoch
in the growth of national character
since the world began. As an American,
he believed that no finger of-medieval
ism should so much as touch this hem
isphere. Tke Cubans had earned their
freedom long since, and the cries of
starving women arid children for thft
bread which fathers and brothers asked
but the right to earn must cease. To
put out' of mind the Americans blown
to death at Havanaâ If such a thing
were possibleâ he. yet believed with all
his heart in the ; war. He did not think
there would be much of a fight â but if
everybody acted on that presumption,
there would be no answer to the call
for volunteers. He was proud to think
that the Legion of his own State, that
in itself stood for the reunion of the
North and the South, had been the first
to spring to arms. And he was proud
to think that not even they were the
first Kentuckians to fight for Cuban
liberty. He was proud that, before the
Civil War even, a Kentuckian of
his own name and blood had !ed a band
of one hundred and fifty brave men of
his own State against Spanish tyranny,
in Cuba, and a Crittenden. viifh fifty
of his followers, were captured and
shot in platoons of six.
"A Kentuckian kneels only to woman
and his God," this Crittenden had said
proudly when ordered, to kneel blind
folded and with his face to the wall,
"and always dies facing his enemy."
And so those Kentuckians â¢ had died
nearly half a century before, and he
knew that the young Kentuckians be
fore him would as bravely dlÂ», if need
be, in the same cause now: .a nd- when
they came face to face with the Span
iard they would remember the shat
tered battleship In tha Havana harbor
and something moreâ they v would- re-
member Crittenden. And -then the
speaker closed with the worda of a cer
tain proud old Confederate soldier to
Â¦his son: .
"My little brother Is going to the
war." he repeated, looking at her.
Judith smiled and went on bravely:
"And- you?" . â¢ â¢ . â¢ â¢ â¢
Crittenden, too, smiled. * â¢
"I may consider it my duty to stay

that he was looking for â and,, in truth,
she was. His. evasive and careless an

by the thoughtful, that he was making
a shameful waste of the talents that
the Almighty had showered so freely
down upon him. And so without suf
fering greatly in public estimation, in
spite of the fact that the ideals of
Southern life were changing fast, he
passed into the old-young period that
Is the critical tfme in the lives of men
like him â -when he thought he had
drunk his cup to the dregs; had run
the gamut of human experience; that
nothing was left to his future but the
dull repetition of his past. Only those
who knew him best had not given up
hope for him,; nor had he really given
up hope for himself as fully as he

'Judith "cared for nobody. Crittenden
laughed and -pleaded,^ stormed, sulked
same way. There was a day when
he was near it; when he turned the
same fresh, frank face ' fearlessly to
the^ world, when his nature wa3 as
unspoiled and as clean, his hopes as
high, and his faith as child-like; and
once when he ran across a passage in
Stevenson in which that gentle stu
dent spoke of his earlier and better
self as his "little brother"" whom he
loved and longed for and sought per
sistently, but who dropped farther and
farther behind at times, until. In mo
ments of darkness, he' sometimes
feared that he might lose him for
everâ-Crittenden had clung to the
phrase, and he had let his fancy lead
him to regard this boy as his early
and better selfâ better far than he
had ever been â his little brother, in
a double sense, who drew from him,
besides the love of brother for brother
and father for son, a tenderness that
was almost maternal. â¢ â¢
| The pike-gate slammed now and the
swiftrush of wheels over the blue
grass turf followed; the barn-gate
cracked "sharply on the night air and
Crittenden heard him singing, in the
boyish, untrained tenor that is so
common in the South, one, of the old
fashioned love-songs that are 'still
sung with -perfect sincerity, and with
out shame by his people:
"Tou'll never find another love like nine, -
Tou'll never find a heart that's half so true."
And then. the voice was muffled sud
denly.' A little while later he entered
the- yard-gate â¢ and stopped in the'
moonlight and, ; from his window,
'Crittenden looked . down and
watched; him. r '.The 'boy was go
ing through the manual of Â¦ arms
with his buggy- whip, at the command
of'x an. imaginary officer,' "whom,
erect -.and martial, -he^was < apparently
looking straight In the eye. Plainly he
was a private how. ' Suddenly he sprauig
forward and saluted;. he was Volunteer
ing for some dangerous duty; and then
had carried Its name canewood down
from pioneer days; that had never been
owned by a white man who was not a
Crittenden; that was Isolated, and had
its slaves ' and the children of those
slaves Btill as servants; that still clung
rigidly to old traditionsâ social, agri
cultural and patriarchalâ out there
Crittenden found himself one day alone.
His. friends â even the boy, his brother
âhad caught the modern trend of
things quicker than he, and most of
them had gone to workâ some to law,
some as clerks, railroad men, mer
chants, civil engineers; some to mining
and speculating in the State's own rich
mountains. Of course he had studied
lawâ his type of â¢ Southerner always
studies law â and he tried the practice
of it. He had too much self-confidence,
perhaps, based on his own brilliant rec
ord as a college orator, and he never
got over the humiliation of losing his
first case, being handled like putty ; by
a small, black-eyed youth of his own
age, who had come from nowhere and
had passed up through a philanthrop
ical old judge's office to the dignity,
by and. by, of a license of his own.
Losing the suit, through some j absurd
little technical mistake, Crittenden not
only declined a fee, but paid -the Judg
ment against j his client out of his own
pocket and went home with a wound
to his foolish, sensitive pride for which
there was no quick cure. A little later,
he went to the mountains, when those
wonderful hills first began to give up
their wealth to the world; but the pace
was too swift, competition was too un
dignified ami greedy, ana business was
won on too low a plane. After a year
or two of rough life, which heJped him
more than - he knew, until long after
ward. , he went home./ Politics .he had
not yet j tried, and /politics hs was â¢ now
persuaded to try. He made a brilliant
the squeak of a pig that was pushed out
of. his warm place by a stronger broth
er. The night noises were strong and
clearâ the cricket- in the grass, thi
croaking â¢ frogs from the pool, the
whir of a night hawk's wings
along the edge of the yard, the
persistent wail of a whip-poor-will
sitting lengthwise of # a willow limb
over the meadow-branch, the occa
sional sleepy caw of crows from their
roost in the woods beyond, the bark of
a house-dog at a neighbor's home
across the fields, and, farther still,
the fine high yell of a fox-hunter and
the faint answering yelp of a' hound.
And inside, in the mother's room, the
curtain was rising on a tragedy that
was tearing open the wounds of that
other war â the tragedy upon which a
bloody curtain had fallen more than
thirty years before. The mother lis
tened quietly, as had her mother be
fore her, while the son spoke quietly,
for time and again he had gone over
the ground to himself, ending ever
with the same unalterable resolve.
There had been a Crittenden in every
war of the nationâ down to the two
Crittendens who slept side by side in
the old graveyard below the garden.
And the Crittendenâ of whom he
had spoken that morning â the gallant
Crittenden who led his Kentuckians to
death in Cuba in 1851, was his father's
elder brother. And again he* repeated
the dying old Confederate's deathless
words with which he had Cirilled the
Legion that morningâ words; heard by
her own ears as well as his own. What
else was left him to doâ^henhe knew
what those three ; brothers, if. . they
were alive, would hsrve him do?
And there were other untold reasons
hid in the core of his own heart; faced
only when he was alone, and faced
again, that, night, after he had left his
mother and was in his own room and
looking out at the moonlight and the
some of them of those old enemies, but
ready to ' fight together now, and as
near shoulder to shoulder as the mod
ern line of battle will allow.
Rivers, bronzed, quick-tempered, and
of superb physique, met him at the
Station. Â«
"You'll come right out to camp with
me." ;-..f
The town was thronged. There were
gra,y slouch hats everywhere with little
brass crosses pinned to them â tiny
rifles, sabers, cannon â crosses that
were not symbols of religion, unless this
was a time when the Master's coming
meant the sword. Under them were sol
diers with big pistols and belts of big,
gleaming cartridges â soldiers, white
and black, â¢ everywhere â swaggering,
ogling, and loud of voice, but all good
natured, orderly.
Inside the hotel the lobby was full
of officers in uniform, scanning the yel
low bulletin-boards, writing letters,
chatting in groups; gray veterans of
horse, foot, apd artillery; company
officers in from Western service â
quiet young men with bronzed faces
and keen eyes, like Rivers' â renewing
old friendships and swapping experi
ences on tthe plains; subalterns down
to the last graduating class from "West
Point, with slim waists, fresh faces,
and nothing to swap yet but memories
of the old school on the 'Hudson. In
there he saw Grafton again and Lieu
tenant Sharpe, of the Tenth Colored
Cavalry, whom he had seen in the
bluegrass, and Rivers introduced him.
He was surprised that Rivers, though
a Southerner, had so little feeling on
the question of negro soldiers; that
many, officers in the negro regiments
were Southern; that Southerners were
; preferred, because they understood
.the | black man, and, for that reason,
could better handle him. Sharpe pre
sented both to his father. Colonel
Sharpe, of. the infantry, who was tak
ing credit to himself that, for the
first time- in his life, he allowed his
band to play "Dixie" in camp after
the. Southerners in Congress had risen
up and voted millions for. the. national
'defense. Colonel Sharpe spoke with
some bitterness and Crittenden won
dered. He never dreamed; that there
was any bitterness on the other side
why? How could a" victor feel bitter
ness for a fallen foe? It was the one
word ' he was " to \ hear about, the . old
war from" Federal or ex-Confederate.

was deadly serious now. "I done

rising higher., and Bob darted into the
barn before she could turn back again
to him, and a moment later darted his
head. like. a woodpecker, out again to
see If the were gone, and grinned si
lently' after her as she rolled angrily
toward the house, scolding both Bob
and Basil to herself loudly.
A ec ng rose from the cowpens Just
he walked on toward the house. Again
he stopped. Apparently he . had been
promoted; now for gallant conduct, for
he waved his Whip and called out "writh
low, sharp stern ess :
"Steady, now! Ready; fire t" And
then swinging his hat over his head: ,
â¢ "Double-quickâ charge!" After- the
charge, he B&t down for a moment on
the stiles, looking up at the moon, and
then came on toward the house, singing
again:
. "Tou'n nÂ«rÂ«r tod a man in all thU worid
Who'll lore yÂ«a half so wÂ«U as I 1otÂ« you.
And inside, the mother, too. was list
ening; and she heard j the elder brother
call the boy' into hisroom'and the door
close, and'she as well .knew the theme
of their talk as though she could hear
all they said." Her. sons-^even the elder
one â did not realize what war was; the
boy looked upon, it as a frolic. That
Â¦was. the -way herVwo brothers had re
garded '. the old- war. They went with
the South, of course, as, did her father
and her sweetheart. And her sweet
heart .was the only one who came back,
and him she married the third month
after the surrender/, when he was so
sick and wounded that he could hardly
stand. Now she must give up all that
was left for the North, that had taken
nearly all she had. \
Was it all to come againâ the same
long days of sorrow," loneliness, the
anxious, waiting, waiting, waiting to
hear that this one was dead, and that
this one was wounded or sick to death
â would either come back unharmed?
She knew now what her "own mother
must have suffered 1 , and what it must
ha"ve cost her to tell her sons what she
had told hers that night. Ah, God, was
it all to come .again?
â
Some days later a bugle blast started
Crittenden from a soldier's cot. when
the flaps of his tent were yellow with
the rising sun. Peeping between them,
he saw that only one tent was open.
Rivers, as acting quartermaster, had
been up long ago and gone. That blast
was meant for the private at the foot
of the hill, and Crittenden went back
to his. cot and slept on.
The day before he had swept out of
the hills again â out through a blossom
ing storm of dogwoodâ but this time
southward bound. Incidentally, he
would see unveiled these statutes that
Kentucky was going, to dedicate to her
Federal and ; Confederate dead. He
would find his father's old comrade â
little Jerry Carterâ and secure a com
mission, If possible. Meanwhile, he
would drill with Rivers' regiment, as a
f soldier of the line.
At sunset he swept Into the glory of
a Southern spring and the hallowed
haze of an old battlefield where certain
gallant Americans once fought certain
other gallant Americans fiercely for
ward and back over some 6000 acres of .
creek bottom and wooded hills, and
where Uncle Sam was pitching tents
tor his war-childrenâ children, too â
big, weeping willow that drooped over
the one white tomb under which 'the
two brothers, 'who had been enemies
in the battle, slept ' Bide â¢ by 6ide * thus
in peace. Bo far he had' followed In
their footsteps, since the one part that
he was fitted to play was the role they
and their ancestors had played beyond
the time when [â¢ the first American
among them, falling, to rescue his king
from Carisbrooke Castle, set sail for
Virginia on the very day Charles lost
his royal head. But for the Civil War
Crittenden would -' have ' played that
role worthily and without question to
the end. With the dose of the war.
however, his birthright was gone â
even before he was bornâ and yet, as

and. he. had emerged '.with a clear eye,

It was midnight now and far across
the "fields came the swift faint beats
of a horse's hoof3 on the turnpike. A
moment later he could hear the hum
of wheels â it was his little brother
coming home; nobody had "a horse
that could go like that, and nobody
else would drive that way if he had.
Since the death of their father, thir
teen years after the war. he had been
father to the. boy, and, time and again
he had wondered now why could he
not have been like that youngster.
Life was an open book to the boy â
to be read as he ran. He took It as
he took his daily bread, without
thought, without question. If left
alone, he and the little girl whom he
had gone that night to see would mar
ry, settle down, and go hand inihand
into old age without questioning love,
life, or happiness. And that was as
It should be; and would to , Heaven

deterioration that comes from idleness,
from energy that gets the wrong vent,
from strong passions that a definite
purpose would have kept under con
trolâand the worse elements of a na
ture that, "at the bottom, was true and
fine, slowly began to take possession of
him as weeds will take possession of
an, abandoned field.
-But even then nobody took him as
seriously as he took himself. So that

against him by the pious was that he

seemed suddenly to still everything else

â¢corner of the barn' he waited. From

"Mollyâ eay, Molly." Â¦ ' .
The song stopped short.
"Say,-, honey, wait a minute â Jes' a.

"Go on, nigger, but you Jes' wait."
Molly Bang on: .-_.:Â¦
"Take By yo" erota, ca. 'â¢ â¢lanet-man." '
Before he knew it. Bob gave the re

"I reckon I got to break dat gal's

whut "my .cross is," and then he started
eltfwly after her, shaking- his. head and,
as. his wont was, talking to himself.
He. was stjll talking to himself when
Basil came cut to the stiles after sup

The boy, too;. laughed as he gathered

Â¦ ''We'll seer-we'U see." .
And Bob .with a triumphant snort
turned toward Molly's" cabin.
j The locust trees were- quiet now and
the barn was c till except for the ooca
sional'stcm^ of a horse In his stall ox
Indeed, he mistook a short, stout.
careless appointee. Major Billings,
with his negro -servant, his Southern
mustache and goatee and his pompous
"ways, for a genuine- Southerner, and
the major, though from Vermont,
seemed pleased.
But it was to the soldier outside
that Crittenden's heart had been
drawn, for it was his first stirring
sight of the regular of his own land,
and the soldier in him answered at
once with a thrill. Waiting for Ri
vers, he stood in the *:?t of the note!
watching the strong men pass, and by
and- by he saw three coming down the
street, arm in arm. On the edge of
the light, the middle one, a low. thick-,
set, black-browed fellow, 1 . pushed his
comrades away, fen drunkenly. and
slipped loosely to the- street, while the
two stood above him in disgust. â¢ One
of them was a mere b.oy and the other
was a giant, with a lean face, so like â¢
Lincoln's that Crittenden started when
the boy called impatiently:
"Pick him up. Abe." 'f \
The tall soldier stooped, and with â¢
one hand lifted the drunken man as.
lightly as though he had been a sack
of wool, and the two caught him un
der the arms again. As they came on,
both suddenly let go; the middle ona
straightened sharply, j and all three :
saluted. Crittenden heard Rivers"
voice at his ear:
"Report for this, Reynolds.**
And the drunken soldier turned an*
rather sullenly saluted again. : .;
"You'll come right out to camp with.
me," repeated Rivers. . . ' :,. - â¢
And now out at the camp, naxt
morning, a dozen trump*ets were ring
ing out an emphatic complaint XntÂ«
Crittenden's sleeping ears: *. . â¢>'.-

The corporal's worse than th'Â» â¢erreaat," . .
The sergeant's worse than the UeutwnTit.* '
And the captain U worst of ill.
This is as high up. apparently, as
the private dares to go, unless he con-'.
siders the somnolent Iniquity of thÂ«,
colonel quite beyond the range of-tbÂ»
bugle. But the pathetic appeal waa
too much for Crittenden, and he got Â¦
up, stepping into a fragrant foot bath,
of cold dew and out to a dapple-gray
wash basin that sat on- three wooden
stakes Just outside. Sousing hia head,
he sniffed in the chill air "and. looking
below him. took in, with pure mathe
matical delight, the- working unit of
the army as it came to life. The very"
camp was the symbol of order and
system; a low hill, rising from : a tiny,
stream below him in a series of natu-"
ral terraces to the fringe of low pines
behind him," and on these terraces
cers and men sitting. aÂ«cording to
rank; the white tepees of the privates. 1
and their tethered horses â camped .in .
column of troops â stretching up the
hill toward him; op the first terrace,
above and flanking the columns, the
old-fashioned .army tents of the com- Â¦
pany officers and subaltern and the'
guidons in line â each captain with; his-,
lieutenants at the head of each com-
pany street; behind them and on the
next terrace, the majors three â each,
facing the- center' of his sqtfadron; i
And highest on top. of the hill, and
facing the center of ths regiment, the
slate-colored tent of the colonel, com
manding every foot of the camp. : '
"Yes," said a voice behind- him.
"and you'll find it Just that, way
throughout the army."
Crittenden turned in surprise, and
the ubiquitous Grafton . went on â¢ as
though the little trick of thought
reading were too unimportant for-no
tice. * . '; '_Â¦Â¦' Â¦Â¦'.'
"Let's- go down and take a look at
things. This is my lost day." Gnafton
went on, "and I'm out early. I. go to
Tampa to-morrow."
All- the day before, as he traveled,
Crittenden had seen the stations ;
thronged with eage,r countrymenâ
that must have been the way It was in 'â¢
the old war, he . thought â and
swarmed the thicker the- farther ha â¢
went south. And, now, as the two:
started down the bill, he could see In '
the dusty road that ran through the
old battle field ~-Â»uthern interest and
sympathy taking visible shape. For a
hundred miles around, ' the human. *
swarm had risen from the earth ] and .
was moving toward him on wagon,
bicycle, horseback, foot; In omnibus,
carriage, cart; in barges on wheels, *
with projecting a - lltions,. and other
land craft beyond- classification or
description. And the peopleâ the
American Southerners; rich whites,
whites well to do, poor white trash;
good countâ folks, valley farmers;
mouritaineersâ darkies, and the 'mot
ley feminine horde that the soldier
draws the world overâ all mqvtni *
along the road as far as he could see. "
and interspersed here and there in
the long; low cloud of dust with a
clanking troop of horse or a red rum
bling battery â all coming to Bee the
soldiers â the soldiers!
And the darkies! How they flocked
and stared at their soldler-brethern
with, pathetic worship, dumb admira
tion, and, here and there, with a look!
of contemptuous resentment that was *
most curious. And. how those dusky*
sons of Mars were drinking deep Into â¢
their broad nostrils the incens* wafted â¢
to them from hedge and highway.
For a moment Grafton stopped still,
looking.
"Great!"
Below the majors'" terrace stood an
old sergeant, with a gray mustache
and a kind, blue eye. Each horse had*
his nose in a mouth bag -nd was con-,
tentedly munching corn, while a*
trooper affectionately curried him
from tip of ear to tip of taiL.
"Horse ever first and man ever
afterward is the trooper's law," said
Grafton.
"I suppose you'ye got the best colo
nel in the army," he added to the, sol
dier and with a wink at Crittenden.
"Yes, sir," said the guileless old ser
geant, quickly, and with perfect sert-'
ousness. "We have, sir, and I*m not*
savin' a wor-rd against the rest; sir."
The sergeant's voice was as kind as
his face, and Grafton soon learned
that he was called "the Governor"
throughout the regiment â that he was
a Kentuckian and a sharpshooter.
He had seen twenty-seven years of
service, and his ambition had been to
become a sergeant of ordnance. He
passed his examination finally, but he
was then a little too old. That almost"
broke the sergeant's heart, but the.
hope of a fight, now, was "fast healing*
it-.
"I'm from Kentucky, too," aald
Crittenden. The old soldier turned
. " "I knew you were, sir."
This was too much for, Grafton.
"Now, how on earth- â " and then he
checked himselfâ it was not hia busi
ness. ]Mte

fell swiftly, and the pines began their
nightly dirge for the many dead who
died 1 under them five and thirty years
ago. They had a new .andominous*
chant now to Crittendehâ a chant of
premonition for the strong men about
him who were soon to follow them.
Campfires began to glow out of . the
darkness far and near over the old.
battle field.
Around a little fire on the top of the
hill, .and in front of the colonel's tent,
sat the colonel, with kind. Irish face,
Irish eye, and Irish wit of tongue.
Near him the old Indian fighter, Chaf
fee, with strong brow, deep eyes, long
jaw, firm mouth, strong chinâ the
long, lean face of a thirteenth century
monk- who was quick to doff cowl for
helmet. While they told war stories'-
Crittenden sat in silence with the
majors three, and WHIlngs, the sur
geon (whom he knew better in Cuba),
and listened. Every now and then a
horse would loom, from the darkness
and a visiting officer would swing Into
light and everybody would say:
"How!" .
There is no humor in that monosyl
lable of good cheer throughout the '
United States army, and with Indiari
like solemnity they said It, tin cup In
Once It was Lawton, tall, bronzed,
commanding. taciturnâ but. fluent
when he did speak â or Kent, v or Sum
ner, or little Jerry Carter himself. And
once, a soldier stepped into the circle
of firelight his heels clicking sharply
together; and Crittenden thought an
uneasy movement ran around the
group, and that the younger men
looked furtively up as though to take
their cue from the colonel. It was the
soldier who had been an officer once.
The colonel showed not a hint of con
sciousness, nor did the impassive sol
dier to anybody but. Crittenden, and
with him it may have been imagina
tion that made him think that, once,
when the soldier let. his eye flash,
quite around the group, he flushed
slightly when he- met Crittenden's
gaze. Rivers shrugged'his shoulders
when Crittenden asked about him
later.
. "Black' sheep â well educated, brave,
well born most likely, came up-from
the ranksâ won a commission- as ser
geant fighting Indians, but always in
trouble â gambling, fighting, and so
forth. Somebody in Washington got
him a lieutenancy, and while the com
- mission was on its way to him out
West he got into a bar room brawl.
He resigned then, and left the army. He
was gentleman enough to do that.
Now he's back. The type is common
in the army, and they often come
back. I expect he has ' Â¦ decency
enough to want to get killed. If he
has, maybe he'll come out a captain '
yet." " ..: .->*.,
By and by came "tattqp/Vand final

then another and another and another
still. At last . "when $ all were,;

that once was dearer than life Itself.
"Love, good night."
Such the trumpet meant, to one
poet, and such it meant to many an
other than Crittenden, doubtless, when
he stretched himself on his cotâ
thinking of Judith there that after
noon, and seeing her hand lift to pull
away- the vet; from the. statues again.'
So it had always* been with him. One
touch of her hand and the veil that
hid his better self parted, and that
self stepped forth victorious. It had
been thickening, fold on fold, a. long
while* now; and how, he thought
sternly, the rending must be' done, .
and should be done with his own '
hands. And then he would go back
to thinking of her as he saw. her.last

what that last look and smile of hers
could mean. Later, he moved I in. his
sleep â dreaming of that brave column

waked him. "And he remembered that

It was mid May now, and the leaves
were full and their points were droop
ing toward the ' earth. The woods
were musical w'th the cries of black
birds as Crittenden drove toward the
pike gate, and the meadow was sweet
with the love calls of larks. The sun
was fast nearing the zenith, and air
and earth were lusty with life. Al
ready the lane, lined with locust trees,
brambles, wild rose bushes and
young elders, was fragrant with the
promise of unborn flowers, and the
turnpike, when he neared town, was
soft with the dust of many a hoof
j and wheel that had passed over it to
ward the haze of smoke which rose
over the first recruiting camp In the
State for the Spanish war. There was
. a big crowd in the lovely woodland
over Â¦ which hung the haze, and the
muslo . of horn and drum j came forth
to Crittenden's ears even that far
away, and Raincrow raised head and
tall and quickened his pace proudly. '
For a week he had drilled at Chick
amauga. He had done the work of a
plain soldier, and he . liked . itâ liked
his temporary comrades, who were
frankly men to men with him, in
spite of 'his friendship with- their su
periors on top of the hill. To the big
soldier, Abe Long, the wag of the
regiment he had been' drawn with
genuine^ affection. He liked Abe's
bunkle, the boy; Sanders, who waa
from Maine, while Abe was a West
ernerâthe lineal descendant In frame,
cast of 'Â¦', mind, and character of ' the
"Don't you Join any regiment yet,"
he said to Crittenden; "you may get
hung up here all summer till the war
is over. If you want to get Into the
fun for sure â wait Go to Tampa and
wait. You might come here, or go
there, and drill and watch for your
chance." "Which was the conclusion
Crittenden had already reached for
hlnself.
The sun sank rapidly now. Dusk
Along the brow of the hill, and but
faintly seen through the smoky haze,
came tha pendulum-like swing of
rank after rank of sturdy legs, with
guidons fluttering along the columns
and big, ghostly army wagons rum
bling behind. Up started the band at
the foot of the hill with a rousing
march, and up started every band
along the line, and through madly
cheering soldiers swung the. regiment
on its way to Tampa â magic word,
hope of every chafing soldier left bet
hind â Tampa, the point of embarka
tion for the little Island where waited
death or glory. Vi'l-.-r VS
. Rivers was deeply dejected.
"Yes, sir," said Crittenden.
"I knew it. Bless me. I was think
ing of him just that moment â natu
rally enough â and you startled me.
Thought it was Tom himself." He
grasped the Kentuckian's hand warm
ly.
"Yes," he said, studying his face.
"You look just as he did when we
courted and camped and fought to
gether." The tone of his voice fioved
Crittenden deeply. "And you are
going to the war â good â good! Your
father would be with me right now if
he were alive. Come to see me right
away. I may go to Tampa any day."
And, as he rode away, he stopped
again, "--^ti
"Of course you have a commission
In the Legion." *-".
"No, sir. I didn't ask for one. I
was afraid the Legion might not get to
Cuba." The general smiled.
"Well, come to see me," he smiled
again. "We'll see â we'll see!" and
he rode on with his hands still folded
on the pommel of his saddle and his
eyes still lifted, dreamily, upward.
It was guard mount and sunset
when Crittenden, with a leaping heart,'
reached Rivers' camp. The band was
just marching out ' with a corps of
trumpeters, when a crash of martial
music came across the hollow from
the camp on the next low hill/fol
lowed by cheers, which ran along the
road and were swollen into a mighty
shouting when taken up by the camp
at the foot of the hill. Through the
smoke and faint haze of . the early
evening, moved a column of infantry
into sight headed by a band.

its power. Behind him that nat'on
was patching up its one great quarrel,
and now a gray phantom stalked out
of the past to the music of drum and
fife, and Crittenden turned sharply to '
see a little body of men, in queer uni
forms, marching through a camp of
regulars toward him. They were old
boys, and they .went rather slowly, but
they stepped Jauntily and, in their
natty old-fashioned caps and old gray
jackets pointed -into a V-shape be
hind, they looked -jaunty in spite of
their years. Not a soldier but paused
to look at these men In gray, who
marched thus proudly through such a
stronghold of blue, and were not
ashamed. Not -a' man Joked or
laughed or smiled, for all knew that
they "were old Confederates in butter
nut, and once fighting men indeed.
All knew that these men had fought
battles that made scouts and Indian
skirmishes and city riots and, per
haps, any battles in store for them
with Spain but play by contrast for the
tin soldier, upon whom the regular
smiles with such mild contempt; that
this thin column had seen twice the
full, muster of the seven thousand
strong encamped there melt away up
on that very battle field In a single
day. And so the little remnant of
gray marched through an atmosphere
of profound respect, and on through
a mist of memories to the rocky little
point where the Federal 'Virginian
Thomas â "The Rock of Chickamau
ga" â stood against seventeen fierce
assaults of hill-swarming demons in
butternut, whose desperate valor has
hardly a parallel on earth, unless it
then and there found its counterpart
In the desDerate courage of the broth
ers in name and race whose lives they
sought that day. They were bound to
a patriotic love feast with their old
enemies in blue â these men In gray â
to hold it on the hill around the four
bronze statues that Crittenden's State
was putting up for her sons who fought
on one or the other side on that one
battle field,* aod Crittenden felt a
clutch at his heart and his eyes filled
when the tattered old flag of the stars
and bars trembled toward him. Un
der its folds rode the spirit of gallant
fraternity â a little, o'* man with a
grizzled beard and with stars on his
shoulders, his hands folded on the
pommel of his saddle, his eyes lifted
dreamily upward â they called him the
"bee hunter," from that habit of ! his
in the old war â : his father's old com
rade, little Jerry Carter. That was
the man Critte'nden had come South to
see. Behind came a carriage, -in
which sat a -woman in widow's weeds
and a tall girl in gray, i He did not
heed to look again to see that it was

where he was throughout the cere
mony, until he saw the girl lift her
hand, and the veil fall away from the
bronze symbols of the soldier that was
in her fathers and in his â stood reso
lutely still, until the gray figure dis
appeared. and â¢ the veterans, blue and
gray intermingled, marched away.
The little general was the last to
leave, and he rode slowly, as if over
come . with memories. , Crittenden'
took off his hat and, while he
tated, hardly knowing whether to
make himself known or not, the little
man caught sight of him and stopped
short
"Why â why, bless my soul, arn't
you Tom Crittenden's son?"
"He was flipping at one shaft with
the cracker of his whip and not look
ing at her, and Judith kept silent; but
she was watching his face. .
"It's time," he went on, with slow
humor. "So far, I've missed being
what I should have been; doing what
T should have doneâ -by a hair's
breadth. I did pretty well in college,
but thereafter, things begin to count!

â and it looks as though I were going

He was quite sincere and unsparing,
H but had Judith been ten years older,,
she would have laughed outright- Aa
it was, she grew sober and sympa
thetic and. like a woman, began to
wonder, for the millionth time, per
haps, how far she had been to blame.
"The comfort I have is that I have
been, and still am, honest with my
self. I haven't done what I ought not
and then tried to persuade myself that
it was right. I always knew it was
wrong, and I did It anyhow. And the

Browning's poem, I believe I always

often I stumble. I shan't give up hope
until I am willing to He still. And I

suddenly â "I haven't missed being a
man."
"And a gentleman," added Judith
gently.
"According to the -old standard; â
no." Crittenden paused.
The sound of buggy wheels Â«nd a
fast-trotting horse rose behind them.
Raincrow lifted his head and quick
ened his pace, but Crittenden pulled
him In as Basil and Phyllis swept by.*
The two youngsters were in high.
spirits, and the boy shook his whip
back and the girl her handkerchief â
both crying something which neither
Judith nor Crittenden could under
stand. Far behind was the sound of
another horse's hoofs, and Crittenden.
glancing back, saw his political enemy
â Wharton â a girl by his side, and
coming at full speed. At once he in
stinctively gave half the road, and
Raincrow, knowing what that meant,
shot out his feet and Crittenden tight
ened the reins, net to check, but to
steady him. The head of the horse
behind he could Just see, but he went
on talking quietly.
"I love that boy," pointing with his
whfp ahead. "Do you remember that'
passage 1 once read you In Stevenson
about hi? little brother"?"
Judith nodded.
The horse behind was creeping up
now, and his nostrils were visible past
the light hair blowing about Judith's
neck. Crittenden spoke one quiet
word to his own horse, and Judith saw
the leaders of his wrist begin to stand
out as Raincrow settled into the long
reach that had sent his sire a winner
under many a string.
"Well, I know what he meant â that
boy never will. And that is as a man
should be. The hope of the race isn't
in this buggyâ it has gone on before
with Phyllis and Basil."
Once the buggy wheels ran within
an inch of a rather steep bank, and
straight- ahead was a short line of
broken limestone so common on blue
grass" turnpikes, but Judith had the
Southern girl's trust and courage, and
seemed to notice the reckless drive as
little as did Crittenden, who made the
wheels straddle the stones, when the
variation of an inch or two would
have lamed his horse and overturned
them.
"Oh, it was nothing, or everything,
just as you look at It. I made a dis
covery soon after you went .away. I
found that when I fell short of the
standard you" â Crittenden spoke
slowly â "had set for me, I gqt'at least
mental relief. I couldn't think of you
until â until I had recovered myself
again." . v;*^'
"I used the discovery."* i
"That was weak."
"It was deliberate." . *
"Then it was criminal."
"Both, if you wish; but credit, me

and the grace to be ashamed.. Bat I'm

.-"I. was. ' Other men may have found
the fires of my conscience smoldering
sometimes, but they were always
ablaze whenever you came near. I
liked you better than the rest â better
than all â "
Crittend^n's heart gave a faint throb
and he finished the sentence for her.
"But one."
"But one."
And that one had been unworthy,
and Judith has sent him adrift She
had always been frank with Critten
den. That much he knew and no
more â not even. the man's name; but
how he had wondered who and where
and what manner of man he was! And
how he had longed to see him!
They were passing over a little
bridge in a hollow where, a cool cur
rent of air struck them and the fresh
ened odor/Of moistening green things
iw the creek bed â the first breath of
the night that was still below . the
cloudy horizon.
"Deterioration." said Judith, almost
sharply. "What did you mean by
that?" â¢ %.;>.
Crittenden hesitated, and he added!
"Go on; 1 we are no longer children.""
The girl gave a low laugh. How
often" he had played this harmless lit
tle part. But there was a cool.self
possession about him that she had
never seen before. She had come
home, prepared to be nice to' him, and
she was finding it easy.
"And you never answered," said
Crittenden. Â¦'Â¦Â¦ V. 'Â¦Â¦'..';;
"No; and I don't know why."
The birds were coming from shade
and thicket â for midday had been
warm â into the fields arid along the
hedges, and were fluttering from one
fence rail to another ahead of them
and piping from the bushes by the
'wayside and the top of young weeds.
"You wrote that you were â 'getting
'over it' 'in the usual way?"
Crittenden glanced covertly at Ju
dith's fare. A mood In her like this
always made him uneasy.
"Not In the usual way; I don't
think it's unusual. I hope not." Â¦
"How then?"
"Oh, pride, absence â deterioration
and other things."
"Why, then?"
Judith's head was leaning back
ward, her eyes were closed, but her
face seemed perfectly serious.
"You. told me to get over it"
"Did I?"
Crittenden did not deign to answer
this, and' Judith was silent a long
while. Then her eyes opened; but
they ;were looking backward again,
and she might have been talking to
herself.
? ; '<"Tm wondering," she said, "wheth
er any woman ever really meant that

"whom she liked," added Judith, as
though she had not seen his move

: say it; she may say It because It is her
duty; but in her heart, I suppose, she
wants him to keep on loving her Just
the. same â if she likes him â " Judith
paused â "even more, than a very lit
tle. That's very selfish, but I'm afraid
It's true."
And Judith sighed helplessly. .
: - "I* think you made it little enough
that time," laughed Crittenden. "Are
you still afraid of giving me too much
hope?"
"I- am afraid of nothingâ now."
"Thank you. You. were ever too
much concerned about me."
Judith smiled dreamily and her
eyes were' looking backward â very far
backward. Suddenly they were shot
with mischief.
"Why, you really don't seem to â "
she hesitated â "to like me any more^"
"I really don't â " Crittenden, too,
hesitated â "don't like you any more
ânot as I did."
"You wrote me that."
"The smile at her mouth twitched
her lips faintly, and still Crittenden

her method â If she had a conscious
method â was as mysterious and as
sure as is the way of nature; and one
could no more catch her nursing a
budding passion here and there than
one" could catch nature making the
bluegrass grow. Everybody saw the
result; nobody saw just how it was
done. Judith wanted to go home, and
Mrs. Stanton, who had brought her to
camp, wanted to go to town. Phyllis,
too, . wanted to go home, and her
wicked little brother, Walter, who had
brought; her, climbed Into Basil's
brake before her eyes, and, making a
face at her, disappeared in a cloud of
dust. Of course, neither of the brothers
nor the two girls knew what was go-
Ing on. but. a few minutes later, there
was Basil pleading with Mrs. Stanton
to let him take Phyllis home, and
there was Crittenden politely asking
the privilege of taking Judith into his
buggy. The girl looked embarrassed,
but* when Mrs. Stanton made a gra
cious feint of giving up her trip to
town. Judith even more graciously de
clined to allow her, and, with a smile
to Crittenden. as though he were a
conscious partner in her effort to save
Mrs. Stanton trouble, gave him her
hand and was helped into the smart
trap, ; with Its top pressed flat. Its nar
row seat and. a high headed, high
reined, half thoroughbred restive be

ment later, smiled a good by to the
placid, lady, who, with a sigh that was
half ' an envious memory, half the
throb of a big heart, turned to her
own carriage, assuring herself that it
really was imperative for her to drive
to town, if for no other reason than to
Bee that her mischievous boy got out
of town with the younger Crittenden's
brake.
Judith and Crittenden were out of
the push of cart, carriage, wagon and
street car now, and out of the smoke
and dust of the .town v and "Crittenden
pulled his horse down to a slow trot
The air was clear and fragrant and
restful. So far, the two had spoken
scarcely . a dozen words. Crittenden
was embarressed â he hardly knew
whyâand Judith saw it, and there
was a suppressed smile at the corners
of her mouth which Crittenden did
not see."
"It's too bad." . Â¦
Crittenden-turned suddenly.
"It's a great pleasure."
It was plain that the old ex-Confed

border backwoodsman of the Revolu
tion.- Reynolds was a bully, and Crit
tenden all but had trouble with him;
for he bullied the boy Sanders when
Abe was not around, and bullied the
"rookies." Abe seemed to have little
use for him. but as;he had, saved the
big soldier's life once in an Indian
fight, Abe; stuck to him, In conse
quence," loyally. But Blackford, the
man who had been an officer once,
had Interested him most; perhaps, be
cause Blackford showed peculiar
friendliness 'tor^ him at once. From
Washington^iBrittehden had heard not
a word ; nor from General Carter, -who
had left 'Chlckamauga' before he could
see him- again. If, within two days
more no word came Crittenden had
made up his mind to go to Tampa,
where the little general was, and
where Rivers' regiment had been or
dered, and drill again and, as Rivers
advised, await his chance.
The camp was like some great pic-'
nic or political barbecue, with the
smoking trenches, the burgoo, and
the central feast of beef and mutton
left, out. Everywhere country folks
were gathering up fragments of lunch'
on the thick grass, or strolling past
the tents of the soldiers, or stopping
before; the colonel's pavilion to look
upon the martial . young gentlemen
who composed his staff, their beauti
ful, horses, and the colonel's beautiful
guests from the river cityâ the big
town of the State. Everywhere were
young soldiers in 'twos "and threes
keeping step, to, be sure, 'but^vith eyes
anywhere but to the front; groups"
lying on the ground, chewing blades
of -Jt>luegrass, watching pretty girls
pass," and lounging lazily; groups to
one side, but. by no means-out of sight,
throwing dice or'playing "craps" â the
game dear to the darky's heart. On
the outskirts were guards to gently
challenge the visitors, but not very
stern sentinels were they. As Critten
den drove in .he saw one' pacing, a
shady beat with a girl on his arm.
And, later, as he stood by his buggy,
looking around -Jiyfth an amused sense
of the playful contrast it all was to -
what he had seen at Chlckamauga, he
saw another sentinel brought to. a sud
den halt by a surprised exclamation
from a girl, who was being shown
through the camp by a strutting lieu
tenant. The^sentinel was : .Basil and
Phyllis was the girl. :
"Why, Isn't that Basil?" she asked,
in an amazed toneâ amazed because
Basil did not speak to her, but
grinned silently,
"Why, it is Basil; why â why," and
she turned -hejplessly from private to
officer and back again. "Can't you
speak to me, Basil ?" .
Basil grinned again sheepishly.
"Yes," he said, answering her, but
looking straight at his supeVior, "I
can If the lieutenant will let me."
Phyllis was, indignant. 'â¢_.
'"Let you!" she- said, witherlngly;
and she turned on the hapless, tyrant
at her side. . - . . s *V
tuckian. The sergeant turned: A sol
dier came up and asked some trifling
question, with a searching look, Graf
ton observed, at Crittenden. Every
one- looked at that man twice, thought
Graf ton. __ and he looked again himself.
It was his manner, his â¢ bearing, the
way his head was set on hrs shoulders,
the plastic force of his striking face.
But Crlttendon saw only that the ser
geant answered the soldier as'though
he were talking to a supe'rior. He had
been watching: the men closely â they
rrtight be his comrades some day â
and, already, had noticed, wrth in
creasing surprise, the character of the
men whom he. saw as common sol
diers â young, quiet and above the
average countryman in address and
Intelligence â and this man's face sur
prised him still more, as did his bear-
Ing. His face was dark, his eye was
dark and penetrating and passionate;
his mouth was reckless and weak, his
build was graceful, and his voice was
low and even â the voice of a gentle
rnari; he was the refined type of the
Western gentleman desperado, as Crit
tenden had imagined it from fiction
end. hearsay. As the soldier turned
away, the old sergeant saved him the
question he was about to ask.
. "He used to be an officer."
"Who â hoWs that?" asked Grafton,
scenting "a story."
The old sergeant checked himself at
<jnce. and added cautiously:
â¢. "He was a lieutenant in this regi
ment'and he resigned. He Just got
back to-day, and he has enlisted as a
private rather than risk not getting to
Cuba at all. But, of course", he'll get
his commission back again." The ser
geant's manner-fooled neither Grafton
nor Crittenden; both respected the old
sergeant's unwillingness to gossip
about a man who had been his supe
rior, and Grafton asked- no more ques
tions.
There was no Idleness In that camp.
JSach man was busy within and with
out the conical-walled tents in which
the troopers lie like the spokes of a
ti heel, -.vith heads, out like a covey of
partridges. Before one tent sat the
tall soldier â Abe â and the boy. his
comrade, whom Crittenden had seen
the night before.
"Where's* Reynolds?' ' asked Crit
tenden, smiling.
â¢ "Guardhouse,", said the sergeant,
shaking his head.
Not- a scrap of waste matter was to
be seen anywhere â not a piece of
paper â not the faintest odor was per
ceptible; the camp was as clean as a
Dutch kitchen.
"And this is a camp of cavalry, mind
you." said Grafton. "Ten minutes af
ter they have broken camp, you won't
be able to tell that there had been a
man or horse on the ground, except
for the fact that It will* be packed
â¢ down hard in places. And I bet you
that in a month they won't have three
men In the hospital." The old ser
geant nearly blushed with pleasure.
"An* I've got the best captain, too,
sir," he said, as they turned away, and
Grafton laughed. ,
"That's the way you'll find it all
through the army. Each colonel and
each captain is always the best to the
soldiers, and, by the Â¦way," he went
on. "do you happen to know about
this little United States regular
army?".
"Not much."
"I thought so. Germany knows a
good deal â England. France, Prussia.
Russia- â everybody knows but the
American and the Spaniard. Just
look at these men. They're young,
strong. Intelligent â bully, good Ameri
cans. It's an army of picked men â
picked for heart, body and brain. Al
most each man Is an athlete. It is
tho finest body of men on God Al
mighty's earth, to-day, and everybody
on earth but the American and the
Spaniard knows It. And how this na
tion has treated them. Think of that
miserable Congress" â Grafton waved
his hands in impotent ragÂ« and ceased
â Rivers was calling them from the
top of the hill.
So all morning: Crittenden watched
the regimental unit at work. He took
a saber lesson from the old sergeant.
He visited camps of Infantry and ar
tillery and, late that afternoon, he sat
on a little wooded hill, where stood
four draped, ghost-like statues â
watching these units paint pictures on
a bigger canvas below him* of the
army at work as a whole.
Every green Interspace below was
thickly dotted with tents and rising
.spirals of faint smoke; every little
plain was filled with soldiers, at drill.
Behind him wheeled cannon and cais
son and men and horses, splashed
; wlth prophetic drops of red. wheeling
at a gallop, halting, unllmbeiing,
loading, and firing Imaginary sheila at
Imaginary Spaniards â limbering and
off with a flash of metal, wheelspoke
and crimson trappings at a gallop
Â¦ again; I-n tha plain below were regi
ments of Infantry, deploying In skirm
ish line, advancing by rushes; beyond
them sharpshooters were at' target
practice, and Uttle bands of recruits
and awkwacd squads were every
where. In front, rose cloud after
cloud of dust, and, under them, surged
cloud after cloud of troopers at
mounted drill, all making ready for
the soldier's work â to kill with mercy
and die without complaint. What a
picture â what a picture! And what a
rich earnest of the sleerlng might of
the nation behind It all. Just under
him was going an "escort of the stan
dard," which he could plainly see.
Across the long drill ground the regi
ment â lit waa Rivers* regiment â stood,
a solid mass of silent, Hvrn8T statues,
and It was a brave sight that cams
now â that flash of sabers along the
long length of the drill field, like ona
leaping horizontal flame. It was a
regimental acknowledgment of the
honor of â esentatlon to the standard,
and Crittenden raised his hat gravely
In recognition of the same honor,
little dreaming that he was soon to
follow that standard up a certain Cu
ban hill. tf&MM
What a picture!
There the nation was concentrating

I was next to broke. Why didn't I hold
my hand? Oh, why? Why? Why?"
And Fortune La Pearle would roll
upon the floor, vainly interrogating the
scheme of things. At such outbreaks
Uri said no word, rave no sign, save
that his gray eyes seemed to turn dull
and muddy, as though from lack of
Interest. There was nr thing In common
between these two men, and this fact
Fortune grasped sufficiently to wonder
sometimes why Uri stood by him.
But the time of waiting came to an
end. Even a community's blood lust
cannot stand before Its gold lust. The
murder of John Randolph had already
passed into the annals of the camp,
and there it rested. Had the murderer
appeared the men* of Nome would cer
tainly have stopped stampeding long
enough to see Justice done, whereas the
whereabouts of Fortune La Pearle was
no longer an Insistent problem. There
'Was gold- In the creek beds and ruby
beaches and, when the sea opened, the
men, with healthy sacks, would sail
away to where the rood things of life
were sold absurdly cheap.
So one night Fortune helped Urt
Bram harness the dogs and lash the
sled, and the train took the winter trail
south on the ice. But It waa not all
south; for they left the sea. east from
St. Michael, crossed the divide, and
I struck the Yukon at Anvik, many
hundreds of miles from ItÂ» mouth.
Then on, into the northeast, past Koy
okuk, Tanana and Mlnook, till they
rounded the Great Curve at Fort
Yukon, crossed and recrossed the
Arctic Circle, and headed south
through the Flats. It was a weary Jour
ney, and Fortune would have wondered
why the man went with him had
not Uri told him that he owned claims
and had men working at Eagle. Eagle
lay on the edre of the line; a few miles
further on the British flag waved over
the barracks at Fort Cudahy. Then
came Dawson, Pelly, the Five Fingers,
might know. He was narrow but deep;
and Fortune, his own humanity broad
and shallow, could make nothing of
him. Did Uri sing when merry and sigh
when sad he could have understood;
but as it was the oryptlo features were
undecipherable; he could not measure
the soul they concealed.
"Lend a hand, Mister Man," Uri or
dered, when the cups had been emptied.
"We've got to fix up for visitors."
â¢ Fortune purred his, name for the
other's benefit and assisted under-,
standingly. The bunk was built
against a side, and end of the cabin.
It was a rude affair, the bottom being
composed of driftwood logs overlaid
with moss. At' the foot the rough
ends of these timbers projected In an
uneven row. From the side next the
wall' Uri ripped back the moss and
removed three of the logs. The Jag
ged ends he sawed off and â¢ replaced,
so that the projecting row remained
unbroken. \ Fortune carried in sacks
of flour from the cache and piled them
on the floor ; beneath the aperture.
On these Uri laid a pair of sea bags,
and over all spread several thtek
nesies of moss and blankets. Upon
this Fortune could lie, with the sleep-
Ing furs stretched over him from one
side of the bunk to the other, and all
men could look upon it and declare
it empty.
In ( the weeks which followed several
domiciliary visits were paid, not a
shack or .tent in Nome escaping, but
Fortune lay In his cranny undisturbed.
'In fact, little attention was given; to
Uri Bram'a cabin, for It was the last
place under the sun "to expect to find
the murderer of John Randolph. Except
during^ such interruptions, Fortune
lolled about .the cabin, playing long
"games of solitaire and smoking endless
cigarettes. Though I his volatile nature Â¦
loved reniality/ the play of words and
laughter, he '"quickly accommodated
himself to Uxi's taciturnity.' Beyond the
â¢ actions and plans of rhls pursuers, - the
state of the trails and the price of dogs
they* never' talked; and. these ; things
were ' only ; discussed ' at rare intervals
and briefly. But Fortune fell to working
out a system, and hour after hour and
day after day he shuffled and dealt,
shuffled and dealt, noted the combina
tions of the cards In Ions columns, and
shuffled and dealt again. Toward the
end even this absorption failed him,
and, head : bowed upon the table, he
visioned the lively all night houses of
Nome, where the ramekeepers, and
lookouts worked in shifts and the clat
tering roulette ball never slept. At such
times his loneliness and bankruptcy
stunned him till he sat for hours In the
same unblinking, unchanging position.
At other times his long pent bitterness
found voice in passionate outbursts; for
he had rubbed the world the wrong way

He " stopped, appalled, crushfxi by

seized the moment. He was not g-iven

followed was the longest in his life,
save one long afterward in another

He ceased as the murderer drew a
prayer book from his pocket With the
aurora borealis glimmering yellow In
the northwest, heads bared to the frost
and naked hands grasping the sacred
book. Fortune La Pearle swore him to
the words he had spoken â an oath
which Uri Bram never intended break-
Ing and never broke.
At the door of the shack the gambler
hesitated for an instant, marveling at
the strangeness of this man, who had
befriended him, and doubting. But by
the candlelight he found the cabl '
comfortable and without occupants,
and he was quickly rolling a cigarette
while the other man made coffee. His
muscles relaxed In the warmth and he
lay back with half -assumed indolence,
Intently studying Urt's face through
the curling wisps of smoke. It was
a powerful face, but its strength
was of that peculiar sort which
stands girt In and unrelated. The
seams were deep-graven, more like
scars, while the stern features were
In no way softened by hints of
sympathy or humor. Under prominent
bushy brows the eyes shone cold and
gray. The cheekbones, high and for
bidding, were undermined by deep hol
, lows. The chin and. Jaw displayed a
steadiness of purpose which the narrow
. forehead advertised as single, and, if
, needs be, pitiless. Everything was
' harsh, the nose, the lips, the voice, the
lines about the mouth. It was the face

"Ever hear of. the Dead Horse
Trail?"
He rlanced up meditatively and For- -

at the.delay..- : .
"Sometimes there are meetings under

low voice and very slowly,. '.'and I met
a man under such circumstances on the
Dead Horse TraiL Freighting an out
fit over the tVhlte Pass In '97 broke
many a man's heart, for there waa a*
world of reason when they rave that
trail its name. The horses died, like
mosquitoes in the first frost, and from
Bkagway to Bennett they- rotted in
heaps. They died at the Rocks, they
were poisoned at the summit and they
starved at the Lakes: they fell off the.
trail, what. there was of It, or they
went through it: in the river they .
drowned under their loads, or -were ,
smashed to pieces against the boulders;
they snapped their legs in the crevices
and broke their backs falling backward
with their packs: In the slourhs they
sank from sight or smothered in the -
slime, and they were disemboweled, in
the bogs- where the corduroy log*
turned end up in the mud; men shot
them, worked them to death, and whan
they were gone went back to the beach
and bought more. Some did not bother Â¦
to shoot them, stripping the saddles off
and the shoe* and leaving them where
they fell. Their hearts turned to atone
âthose which did not breakâ and they
became beasts, the men of Dead Horse
Trail. ,'/./.-Â¦
"It was there I met a man with the
heart of a Christ and the patience. And* â¢
he was honest. When he rested at mid
day be took the packs from the horses
so that they, too, might rest.' He paid -
$50 a hundredweight for their (odder,
and more. He used his own bed to
blanket their backs when they rubbed
raw. Other men let the saddles eat
holes the six* of water buckets. Other
men, when the shoes rave out, let
them wear their hoofs' down to tne
bleeding stumps. He spent his last dol
lar for horseshoe nails. I know this,
because we slept in the one bed and
ate from the one*' pot, and became blood
brothers where men lost their grip of
trilnrs and died blaspheming God. He
was never too tired to ease a strap or
tighten a cinch, and often there was
tears In his eyes when he looked on all
that waste of misery. At a passage In
the rocks, where the brutes upreared
bindlerred and- stretched their forelegs
upward like cats to clear the wall, the
way was piled with carcasses where
they had toppled back. And here he
stood, in the stench of hell, with a
cheery word and a hand on the rump
at the right time, till the string passed
by. And when one bogged he blocked
the trail till It was clear again; nor did
the man live who crowded him at such
time. ,'

had killed fifty horses wanted to buy,

MAN WHO GOT WELL,
ANYHOW.
PEOPLE WHO BLOCK THE WAY
yOU are hurrying along a narrow
street, Intent on some errand,
when suddenly a form looms up
big, bulky, unyielding. Right in
your path, it at once arrests your
progress. The man acts as if the
street belonged to him alone.- You
have to back and tack and' if finally,
after a long detour, you succeed in
getting around him you are delayed
quite a bit in your Journey and the
"blocker" gazes at you resentfully, as
he resumes his wonted position in the
middle of the way.
The big, obstinate man in the mid
dle of the narrow street is the type
of the individuals who make a point
of interposing objections and obsta
cles to every progressive step. Now
the radical needs the conservative
perhaps and the conservative needs
the radical. One acts as a wholesome
check upon th* other arid the world
gets on because of the action and In
teraction of these two great forces.
We must have a certain number of
careful watchdogs over against every
State or national treasury. But when
a man conceives of his position in the
church or the community to be sim
ply that! of a brakeman, to bring
things to a halt as often and as quick
ly as possible, he is something more
than a conservative. He becomes a
reactionary and he would better get
up in a. cab and ride with the engin

goshdlngmythrofiritis of the lnfernal
fibustofrangiphasteum â if there is
such a thing to be had in this country.
Ailman I was put wise to the fact
that he was in bad health by a circu
lar which came to him by mall from a
patent medicine factory. The circu
lar stated that nine out of every ten
persons had something the matter
with them which could be cured by
taking from one to six bottles of Com
pound Extract of Do-Fine.
On the back of the circular there
was a symptom blank which made It
very easy for a person to find out
whether he needed the remedy or not.
The questions, In part, were as fol
lows:
Q. Does eating affect your appe
tite? A. â
Q. Does hard work make you feel
tired? A. â /
Q. Do you feel the heat In summer?
A. â
Q. Does the loss of money make you
low-spirited? A. â
Q. Does spinning around make you
diszy? A. â
- Q. Do you yawn when you are
sleepy? A.â . â¢
Q. Do you feel that you are growing
old? A. â
If the answers were "Yes" the medi
cine should be taken . at once. If the
answers were "No" it should Â» be taken
anyhow.
While It was not absolutely neces
sary to fill out the blank and send It In
to the main office, it was advisable to
do so for the reason that Compound
Extract of Do-Fine always works 'bet
ter when the patient puts his troubles
down in writing. v

that he had swallowed a lizard while
drinking spring water and prescribed
for him some powders which amelled

departure Is said to have saved All

The invalid next stacked tip against
a remedy recommended by a friend
who claimed that It had cured several
persons who had been given up by doc
tors. But there was nothing doing in
the way of an Improvement in All
man's condition. No matter how hard
he tried to get on edge, he continued
to go to the bad.
Well, in time Ailman went broke,
and could not even raise the price of &

his eyeglasses and could read no more
circulars. Then he became deaf and
could not hear advice, so he promptly
became hale, fat and sassy.

explained everything. Ailman read

When- he had consumed the six bot

worry and losa flesh. He switched and
went up agaisst another advertised

In time It became noised around
Agueviile that Ailman was la a bail
way. When Widow ilullenleaf got
wind of It sbe sent him a pint of herb
tea which had been used by her family
for more than forty years. Ailman
started In on It, but before he had
taken one-half Deacon Sudraiser heard
of his sad plight and persuaded him to
try a prescription which his grand
father, who was a cracking good doc
tor, had used with wonderful results.
After trying it without success. All
man's friend, Erasmus Mudfudder, in
duced him to throw the concoction out
of the window and get well by using
his stand-by, which was an infusion
made of a root he 'had bought from an
old eauaw who kept the place of Its
growth a secret. It did him no good.
" 'I don't object to cards,' the old boy
went on, 'though I never play myself,
bein' a Presbyterian and a deacon, and
I've often lent my stone for a quiet
game of whist or casino-^but further
than that I don't go.'
"A cold breeze whispered through the
weeping willows around, and the poor
old gentleman shivered so he became a
mere blur.
" 'I wish I was a hunter, I do,' he
said when he had rectified his outlines,
'but I've no friends nor relatives living
and no home in consequence.' He sort
of choked here, and his ton. was so sor
rowful that even I could hardly keep
from weeping. It seemed a sad and
lenely thing.
"I hated to bother him in bis sorrow,
but I really wanted to know, so I asked
him if he was compelled to haunt only
relatives.

However,- the place seemed quiet and
peaceful enough. The gravestones
Â¦etanding out white In the moonlight
were the nearest to spectral forms
that I saw" until I reached the en
trance gate. Near that is an old-fash
ioned table stoneâ Â«lab- on four legs,
you knowâ and I tell. you, boys, the
chills played tag up and dow*h my
back when I saw sitting on It the fig
ure of anr old gentleman clad In a by-Â»
gone fashion and having a sort of white
cloak gathered around his shoulders.
"The flgure was translucent, with a
shimmery whiteness caused by the re
flected light from the stone beneath.
Curiously enough, I could read the in
scription on the stone right through it:
'Silas Stubbs, departed this life Decem
ber 2, 18<5/
"He was rather short, was Stubbs.
His legs were curled up and his arms
folded about him as though he were
chilly. Waves of cold were rippling
over him Just like wind over a wheat
field."

rooster crows In the dairy around the

to a large family vault as he spoke.
" 'Is that a club?' I asked. 'I thought
it belonged to the Grogginses.' Â¦
" 'It used to be, but the present Grog

"Certainly not," returned, Dapperly,
"but afterward I recalled how he look

DAPPERLY'S GHOST
BY T. B. 'WRIGHT
Seemingly the -road was clear.
Gerald almost doubted if Juana
had told the truth. But suddenly
the shadows were alive with men,
that sprang at the bridles of the
leaders, cutting the traces} from
all sides the hooting, yelling:,
drink-crazed Mexicans swarm
ed like wasps. There were
more of them than Juana
had said, and as Gerald
plunged into the thick
of It he made straight
for Caracas Johnny*. It
was too close work for
the rifles â a hand-to
hand duel with the
terrible knives. Short,
swift, indescribably
brutal, a bare five
minutes and 't was
over; but one of Ger-;
aid's best men would
ride no more, and
Gerald himself was
b le e d i n g profusely
from an ugly cut be

the bowie of Caracas
Johnny had searched
for his heart. Thanks
to the mescal Johnny's
Rim was bad, and John
ny would spend many daya
days at Santa Fe in conse
quence thereof.
Comanche Jake lay be
neath his pony a lifeless heap
from which Juana had nothing
to fear. But the guards were all
but hacked to death where they
had fought to protect . their treasure
bass. Gerald leaned against the black
pony, faint from loss of blood, but
fighting it off, while he saw that those
of the Mexicans that did not get away
were safely bound.
"With the last knot tied, the dead
and- wounded were to be disposed of.
It was gTay dawn when at last the
etajre was ready to go on to An-
CUilla.
Gerald had fancied that a smoth

when the fighting began. Since then -,:>
Jt had.been quiet inside, but^as heÂ« r :
tried to mount the pony he was
not surprised to hear a woman's

Â¦ Th* black pony 'sniffed the air sus

and as. the blanket slipped from her
'."shoulders : Gerald Baw .- that -it' was

-.the -distant ter>ee in the mesqulteâ
"Senor, if you let Jake come back, he
will know I told you; then God- and
Our Lady have mercy," and the squat
figure slipped away into the night.
He did not question the truth of the
woman's statement. The*re was work
for the Blue.- Star outfit at Antelope's
Run. It worried him, that this should
have come Just as they needed all their
best men for the big drive; but where
a woman's honor was at stalce, there
could be no question of cattle.
Ten minutes of hurried galloping to
and fro and Gerald led off his cattle
force, leaving a half dozen,' out the
gate. As they shot up the Santa Fe
trail his watch showed 11 o'clock by the
moon's rays.
The swift ponies laid down to their
:%vork, and the earth rolled back be
neath their hoofs, as they rode in the
quick, cavalry trot over miles of sage
grass and white sand, past prairie dog
towns, where the alert tenants whisk
ed out of sight like so many small
ghosts, past t-he dry arroyos like white
scars on the face of the plain. On and
on. Here a bunch of mesquite, gnome
like in the spectral light, clumps of
prickly pear and weird contortions of
the slant cactus â ten miles, fifteen,
and they began the ascent where the
plain rolls ur> toward the foothills.
They- could see the highway, where it
wound like a snake, seeking its lair
Jp the shadow of the trees that begin
at Antelope's Run.
Gerald pulled out his watch. The
stape was due at 3 o'clock, and they
had a little less than an hour to wait.
He turned to the men. "Boys, we
will ride on and meet them; then there
will be no chance of their getting us
mixed with the attacking force."
There was as yet no sign of Co
manche Jake and his men; but, as
Juana had said, "ley would be likely
to stay, with the mescal until the last
minute. Gerald and his men rode
slowly up the trail to a point about
three â¢ miles beyond the run. Then
t-hey drew rein and waited until they
heard the roll of wheels and the thud
of horses' feet, as the stage clattered
down 'the trail. There were two guards
on the outside with their rifles cock
ed across their l6iees. Gerald rode
out, and as he raised hi3 hand a bul-
"they are over thereâ half a dozen like
Jake, all mad with the mescalâ and
they go to rob the Anguilla stage when
it passes Antelope's Run. Senor, they
will kill â they'll kill me when they find
I've told; but Caracas Johnny came in
at nightfall from up above, and told
how he got a message, while at An
guilla, in cipher from a pal of his in
Santa Fe, and It said there was Gov
ernment gold a comin' through, and
that there was a woman, too, who was
rich and had money along with her.
They've got it all planned how to do
for the driver and the guards, and Ca
racas Johnny is to have the woman.
Penor. for the love of the mother that
bore you get out your men and save
"her, or kill her. Don't let that devil
get her. . It's twenty miles to Ante
lope's Run, but Jake and the boys
won't start till midnight, and they'll be
drunk with the mescal." â¢*Â¦"
"And how about you?" asked Gerald.
Juana gathered her blanket closer.

5and another selection, another reading
aloud of the fortunate names. Many

through "The Inflerno." But we will
follow the twice chosen and - selected
into a' large room, where - the Presi
dent's military staff are sauntering
about.- Then if you are lucky you go

the explanation that he Is bored and
perhaps consumed by his "curiosity to
know what will happen In. the' land
that he has reconstructed after his an
nounced eelf-effacement is accom
plished.' Some, of the, practical
aspects. of the political situation in our

-have eighty thousand fellow-citizens
and perhaps a thousand, million dollars
out on investment to look after, will
well repay, attention, and it would be
like picking money up in the street to
know .withpuf the peradventure of a
doubt w.ho Is going to take up the suc
cession, .whether the course is to be
the same or a new one,* which in Mex
ico, is. the old, leading to civil war and
bankruptcy. Two names alone are
mentioned, that of Llmantour, the able,
up-to-date financier', and Bernardo
Reyes, a general of somewhat anti
quated, if not positively reactionary,
ideas. .But for the present 1 would
have' you take a look at Diaz. It may
be. one of parting. ->V."
If you would see Diaz to best advan
tage I would say go to his office, the
little room in which all political wires
by means' of which he rules the coun
try converge. It Is in the somewhat
ungainly, not to say ugly, building that
is known as the National Palace, and
stands in the great' open square of
Mexico City above the ruins of an'Az
tec shrine. You must be very careful
what kind of a cab you take when
you drive to the palace. Pedestrians
stand no chance of. admission; and a
blue-colored cab. is distlngulsed, a red
one is only, respectable, while a yellow
one,* lowest in the category. iÂ« liable to
land you In the smallpox hospital and
not in the -presence of the despot. There
will let you go with a hand shake that
passes for "English" on the French
stage. But if you inspire Interest the
interview may prove very long; one
hour, two hours, and even three they
have been known to last, while the
other clients hungered and thirsted In
"The Inflerno." ' You may teach the
President many things or merely
prove to him that you are a chatter
box; but one thing is quite certain, he
will not talk himself except about the
sleeping cars in the United States. Less
than any other man I have ever met is
he given to making confidences. V"
It is hardly necessary to say any
thing about Jose I vea Llmantour, be
cause he is personally so well known
in New York. If he - becomes Presi
dent the ruler of our neighbors across
the Rio Grande will be a : habitue of
our best clubs and in close personal
touch with our leading.. Â«men. He
speaks English without an accent and
knows the United States like the palm
of his hand. You regard him' as more
than : half American until ' you meet
him in Paris,- when you would swear
that he had never left France in his
life. This adaptability, or. rather this
ability (which is given. to few Mex
icans) to pass for an American in New
York. and a Frenchman on the boule
vards, is a heavy political handicap to
the' suffrages â¢ of â¢ the Mexicans which
Llmantour could not hope to contend
against without the very decide* sup
port .of Diaz. -.
How long Limantour could maintain
himself in power is a question upon
.which those Â¦ expert . in Mexican oondl
, tions never can agree, and perhaps it
; ls wisest to await the course of events.
- He can never < become. President with
out the sanction of Diaz. Yet, doubt
less, . as long as aa he lives Dlas can
.keep his man or his ; puppet on the
throne. , Yet he must die some time;
even the Oaxaca Indians,. though famed
for Â¦ their longevity, in . the end â¢ go , the
.way. of all flesh. . The benevolent despot
is now at least 76 years old,' probably
older, and the question whether X4Â»
antour could stand alone is one that
may at any day become urgent.
It is, of course, perfectly possible
that he may develop qualities suited .to
the new conditions and prove as suo
cessful in politics as he has in finance.
A few year3 ago when he came to New
Â¦York everybody in Mexico as well as in
"Wall street said it would do him, good
âthat is, his healthâ but as for the
avowed purpose of his visit, the nego
tiation of a loan, he might as well
spare himself the pains of trying. Wall
street, it was asserted, had never yet
made a loan to a foreign government,
and was not likely to begin with Mex
ico. However, Llmantour secured the
loan, and he may be able to conjure
the want of confidence which the great
majority of Mexicans entertain toward
him in the same way that he succeed
ed in dispelling the suspicions of our
banking magnates. ' '
Even his friends admit that the ab
sence of Indian blood tells heavily
against Diaz's candidate in the scale
of popularity. He not "only wears a
coat with apparent comfort, but he
wears it like a foreigner, and It is hard
for the Mexicans of the lower class to
forgive him this. Of course, every for
eigner, whether resident or merely an
Investor, is interested in his taking up
the Diaz succession, an interest which
I have often thought is not helpful to
his ' chances. 1 ' It can be said that all
the' Americans and English, who are
conducting the great railway and min
ing enterprises; the Germans and
French, with their small trade which
at the end of the year bulks to large,
and the thrifty emigrants from North
Spain, the Catalans and the Basques
are for Llmantour to a man. And, of
course, there are a certain number of
enlightened Mexicans who recognize
that the prosperity of the country dur
ing the last few years is due In a large
measure to the commercial and in
dustrial invasion of foreigners, and
is a long stairway, of honor, with a
number of sentries, who will present
arms If they like the cut of your back
coat; then a long gallery, musical with
crystal chandeliers and stuffy with
heavy hangings. The place has no in
dividual note; It Is cosmopolitan. You
might be In the anteohamber of a Chi
nese mandarin or a Wail-street mag
nate, or merely strolling around the
corridor of. a somewhat flashy summer
hotel. This place Is called In ' Mexico
"The Inflerno," which I will not trans
late, because the word is not admitted,
In our composing room. Â¦ hy % ':
"The Inflerno" is crowded, â¢ always
crowded, and cosmopolitan. Americans,
Mexicans, Indians and Chinese crowd
there, for the President is an amiable
man and gives more audiences in a
day than he can possibly receive In a
month. All the clients stand around
and hobnob and gesticulate. "The Pres
ident has Just sent for me," says one
in his particular lingo. And Â¦ another
takes up the cry: "He sent for me last
year, but I've never seen him yet. I'm
caughf in the Inflerno."
â¢ Suddenly the conversation dies away
and you almost hear the palpitations
of many anxious hearts. A uniformed
officer Btriped and barred like an oriole
has.' appeared in the doorway. He
reads with a somewhat supercilious
smile the list of the chosen. Those who
are summoned pass with him beyond
the curtain, one step nearer the repub
lican throne. The disappointed; and
the disgusted remain behind in "The
Inflerno" until the rattle of the Presi
dent's carriage a.nd the clanking har
ness of his mounted guards tell them
that business is over L for. the day and
that the benevolent despot of : Mexico
has gone to take his ease at Chapul
tepec '\
However, Instead of finding them
selves in the presence of the President,
those who ; passed v the curtain, merely
enter a second " gallery, " locally" . "The
Purgatorio." Here there is another wait
It is not hard to understand why he
cares no longer to linger on the scene
from which one by one his contempora
ries have vanished, for Diaz la not of
our generation, but belongs to the class
of Titans who have gone, leaving be
hind them such spacious vacancies. He
began to make history about' the same
time that Bismarck did and Gladstone
"and Garibaldi. Grant and Pope Leo
were of his class. He came into* power
born of civil strife and foreign inva
sion. He has known what it was to
starve in New Orleans,' apparently a
discredited revolutionist, and to be
hunted like a lone wolf through the
lonely sierra by- the powers- that were.
He has been saved a score of times by
the mettle of his horse and by* the
strength of his swimming and by the
ascendency of his star, in which his
countrymen are not without reason for
believing, for in this way he escaped
from a filibustering vessel off Vera
Cruz, which' 6hortly afterward foun
dered and went down with all on board.
Since 1ES4, however, the life of the
"amiable despot" has been singularly
calm and unexciting, though not un
eventful. But the path of unalloyed
prosperity may have begun to pall

In a policy of practical exclusionâthat
Is, Mexico for the Mexicans.
*. Two years ago, when Reyes was ap
parently In high- favor, he was sud
denly dismissed from the Ministry of-
War and practically exiled to the re
mote State of Nuevo Leon. The Gov
ernorship of this place, which wu as
signed him. could not well hare been
more unimportant., and It was loon
noticed that even here whatever pow
er there was fell to tha subordinate
chiefs who nominally worked under
him. He waa a prisoner on parole
rather than a Governor. There can
be no doubt that much popular sym
pathy followed Reyes aa ha went to
his unimportant and Isolated place.
It was generally believed, and he cer
tainly did nothing to discredit the be
lief, that he had- fallen because he
opposed the further extension of for
eign Influence In the country. There
was another story to this affect: Dlajj
had offered him the succession pro
vided he would agree at the end of
one term In office to step aside In fa
vor of Porflrlo Dlas Jr., who' by this
time would have reached tha eligible
age. Reyes Is supposed to have an
swered - that the elections, tha ballots
of his fellow countrymen, must de-;
cide. Upon this followed his disgrace
and the elevation of Llmantour to the
position of heir apparent. â¢'â¢.
Slnoa that time Limantour. only
Minister of Finance In name, has not
confined his activity to fiscal matters.
More' and more he has been taken
Into the confidence of his chief, and
one by one the benevolent despot has
unloaded his burdens upon younger
shoulders. To-day, at the Instance of
Diaz himself, an amendment to the'
constitution is being railroaded
through the docile Legislature pro
viding for a Vice President, who Is
further permitted to hold another of
fice. It does not require tha sight
which penetrates millstones to recog
nize what Diaz has in view, though
whether he will carry It out is quits
a different matter.
At present his purpose Is apparently
to appoint Llmantour Vice President
and yet allow him to retain the Treas
ury portfolio. He Is to be, in fact, tf â¢
not in name, the Regent while Diaz is
away In Europe, this temporary ar
rangement to become permanent In
case It works well, or when tha tireless
brain of the. great Mexican politician
Is stilled in death. ;}\
The chances are. I think, in favor of
peace and an adjustment of political
rivalries and Presidential ambitions
within the law, especially should Dlas
long survive his withdrawal from pub
lic affairs. During the last twenty-'
five years in no country of the world
has the material prosperity of the peo
' pie Increased at sueh a rapid rate as In
Mexico, and In a large measure this
change is due to the fostering care and
the tireless activity of the Dictator. He
found them a people dependent upon
donkeys and mules for transportation
and confined as to their wants and
their activities to their respectiTe
pueblos. Under his direction and prin
cipally owing to his encouragement tea
thousand miles of extremely difficult
railways have been built, and to-day
the Mexican can and does buy large
ly In the markets of the world. This
In a sentence, is the story of Dlas?s
long term in the Presidential chair
from 1878 down to the present day. 'A*
new generation is growing up; the
young men of to-day are of the same
blood as were the tireless banditti gen
erals of the last generation. v Tha rav
ages of the revolutionary period*
though now remote, were so terrible
that it is. hard to believe that they
have been forgotten. To-day undoubt
edly the great, the very great, majori
ty of Mexicans want only peace, at
home and abroad. It remains to be
seen, however, whether, once the oun
nlng hand and the cool head that has
guided them, bo long Is removed, they
will be able to cope as successfully as
he has done with an unruly, lawless
minority.
Even Diaz's enlightened rule did not
reach the height which the mustering
out of the army would Indicate. But he
has done the next best thing to that,
and counterbalanced in a measure the
danger of/one army by having two. I
refer to the rurales, the mounted con
stabulary, who patrol Mexico from end
to end, who swear by Diaz and have
no love for the army proper, because
they frequently come in conflict with
its prerogatives. These men. If only
from enlightened self-interest, are apt
to oppose the narrow, exclusive policy
with which Reyes Is generally credited,
and to combat resolutely the Indian
supremacy of tha army. One thing,
however, is certain, should, aa some
prophesy, neither Reyes nor Llmantour
follow upon Diaz, but anarchy and con
fusion, owing to the presence of our
people In Mexico to the number of 75,
000 and owing to our Investments there,
which have been estimated as high as
11,000,000,000, we shall not be able to
stand aside as disinterestedly as we
surveyed the revolution of the *70*s, out
of which Diaz, the man of destiny,
emerged. Mexico has become not only
geographically, but In a deeper sense
of the word, our next door neighbor. No
radical change In the course of affairs
down there can leave us Indifferent.
Sonora and Chihuahua are practically
American to-day. Perhaps they, too,
are destined to follow the example of
Texas and New* Mexico and come un
der the flag. STEPHEN BONSAI*

ONE very cheering thought can be
adduced from the' holiday book
trade, and that is that standard
works upon the fine arts have had
a more ready acceptance than ever be
fore. Should this prove to be not a
passing fancy, but the beginnings of a
sincere regard for art. outside of the
charmed circle of the ultra esthetic and
an indication that in the "land of dol
lars" there Is to be a BOlld appreciation
of that which lifts the thoughts of men
to higher pianes, 6urely we have Just
cause for self-congratulation. As hap
py earnest of this seeming advance in
the esthetic appreciation of Americans
witness the wide popularity of "Ameri
can Sculpture,", by the eminent Ameri
can sculptor, Lorado Taft, and Lord
Balcarres' "Donatello." The-one a criU
iclsm of the great master of the Re
naissance and the other a history of
the upbuilding of a distinctly American'
cchool of plastic art, the two works may
be considered as handbooks upon two
widely different but equally distinctive
art epochs. ""''
Lorado Taft undertakes to trace from
its beginning the advance of the sculp
tor's art in this country, showing: the
various influences tending, to ; mold 1 its
course and the personal stamp left upon
it by those whose work. has been con
sidered representative. Though unstint
ing In hlB criticism of some 'of 'the slip
shod productions of earlier and even
more recent sculptors, Mr. Taft sounds
a very hopeful note of prophecy for the
future of American sculpture. He is
certain that we 1 now possess, an;- art
which attains to the dignity of a, mo
tional expression and which can take its
place along with the Italian and French
as a distinct school.
Reviewing in detail the works of Hoii
don, Cerrachl and WJlllam Rush, the
first native born American sculptor;
Taft passes on to give Hiram Powers
of the "Greek Slave" fame a careful
study. This man, who, of all the for
mer'American sculptors, dared, brave
the wrath of the blue stockings arid
produce a nude figure, holds the place
of father of true "plastic art in America,
according to Taft. ' - â¢< - â¢

A very good example of the political
novel is "The. Chasm," by Reginald
Wright Kauffmann ; and Edward
ChCds Carpenter. Though the" marks
of collaboration 'are often too evident â
the one making up* the situations and
thÂ« other doing the dialogue â the' Joint
efforts of the two authors have resulted
In a -very remarkable book.
The tale deals with the great love
of a man for tils eon and the- curdling
of .this hove Into gall by the action of
the son In allying himself with the
party which -Is. opposing his father In
politics. The father- is Larry O'Brien,
a' somewhat idealized political boss
whose kind -could hardly be encounter
ed outsi-de of book covers. ' For he re
fuses to . stuff a ballot-box when the
time for EtufSng seems fully ripe,, and
he Is the soul ofhanor-ln dealing even
with the â¢ machinations of the party
organized to oust him from, power.
Somewhat improbable as the charac
ter of Larry O'Brien aeems to be, the
Join.t authors have 'made him the cen
ter of a lively tale of love and ballots.
In fact, the love element is too strong;
it dominates the political thread to*
such an extent that the reader is really
more anxious over "the outcome of
O'Brien's affairs with Miss Van Drell
than that 0/ the State .election" The
impression â¢ one gains from "The

lation upon what political turn will
take place In our sister republic when
the present strong hand has been re
moved from the helm, and much Inter
est has attached itself of late to affairs
beyond the Rio Grande as a conse
quence. Particularly timely, therefore,
are the two "books upon Mexican na
tional life by Arthur Howard Noll. "A
Short History of Mexico" and "From
â¢Empire to Republic." The flrat of these
two will be recognized as a revision of
a former work by the same author,
made up to date and more suitable for
present-day reading; the latter is a
companion book, dealing more in detail
with the crucial periods of Mexico's
â¢struggle for good government.
Though much the same conditions of
birth and growth- surrounded the rise
of the Mexican state as those associated
.with the turbulent lives of some of the
minor states of Central and 1 South
America, the progress of Mexico toward
a firmly based nationality has not been
marked by so much of the opera bouffe
politics and black-legged tours de force
"which have made the names fof some
of Â¦ the' mosquito republics a byword
among the family- of nations. In deal
ing with .the life story of the cactus

vicissitudes Is aptly shown > by the au

In Tils first somewhat sketchy review
of the whole history of Mexico Noll
finds much of the romantic to narrate.
The story of the invasion of Mexico by
the Aztecs, the building of their curi
ous cities on the shores of Lake Tez

Lord Balcarres' appreciation of the
sculpture of Donatello, the great Flor
entine, Is more of an artist'B book than
a work for general reading. Himself
an expert critic and art antiquarian,
the author has devoted his work to a
complete survey of all the compositions
credited to Donatello, corroborating or
taking exception to established opinion
on these mooted points and furnishing
minute criticism upon all of the classic
pieces of statuary. So Intertwined are
the histories of all the great truth
painters and truth carvers of the Ren
aissance that Lord -Balcarres has, per
force, dwelt upon the work and Influ
ence of Michael Angelo and Leonardo
da Vlncl: 'ever Interesting reading to
those with an eye to the beautiful and
an appreciation of transcending genius.
Donatello's limitations in comparison
to Michael Angelo the author very free
ly [admits'. He says:
"Donatello was pledged to no system
nnd his only canon, If such existed, was
the canon of observation matured, by
technical' ability. We have no reason
to suppose that Donatello claimed to.be
a deep thinker. He did not spend his
time.. like Michael Angelo, In devising
theories to explain *the realms of art.
He was -without analytical pedantry,
and, like his character, his work was
nalve^ and. direct."
that time, through the earnest strivings
of such as Saint Gaudens, French, Mac-
Monnics and that vigorous pioneer into
new fields, Barnard, much has \ been
achieved. - So aptly, has Taft com
bined the elements of criticism and
narrative in his work that the artistic
proportions remain" :in "nice balance.
Over a hundred excellent half-tones il
lustrate the text in a very adequate
manner.
Another very readable book of mod
ern" life is "The Web," by Frederick
Trevor Hill. There are" few novels writ
ten around the law which have the
power to catch and hold Interest, but
"The Web" is assuredly one of these.
It presents in graphic style the fierce
strain of- competition existing in the
profession, and it has the further at
.tractlon of revealing to : the layman
some of . the methods which serve to
spin the web about the unfortunate
litigant who has had the temerity to
approach the bar -of Justice for redress.
Mr. Hill's story deals with the mach
inations of a powerful corporation in
its efforts to defraud a young woman
of her stock in the concern. A battle
of lawyers, the maligning of a woman's
fa4r name and a near approach to trag
edy are some of the features of this
forceful portrayal of the drama of mod
ern day life.

Mr. Noll inducea him to' attempt a
more scholarly review of the struggle
for a constitutional government on the
part of the people whose history he has
selected as his field. This volume seeks
to follow the growth of the Mexican
idea of nationality from the time of the
lifting of the Spanish yoke down to the
present so-called republican form of
government, which has its fountain
head in Porfirio Diaz.
Few -nations have experienced more
political calamities before attaining
unto a knowledge of principles of gov
ernment by the people than Mexico.
The oppressive rule of Spain and the
exactions of the inquisition so crushed
the energies of the Mexicans that
when they were free to govern them
selves the spirit of nationality â¢ was
twisted into a hundred various chan
nels playing at cross-purposes with
one another. Yet, too prolific and enter
prising to be destroyed by its own war
ring factions, Â¦ Mexico , succeeded in
learning through abuse the privileges
of self-government, and she is now in
the heyday of her political salvation.
The author devotes considerable at
tention to the kaleidoscopic changes of
government during the formative pe
riod of the Mexican state in order to
trace the underlying spirit of good gov
ernment and note the oross-currents of
charlatanism which found their brief
support from parties yet new to things
political. Considerable space is devoted
to the" present position of the orthodox
Catholic church In the southern state
and the antagonistic spirit existing be
tween church and state.

But there are some very painful drags
in the story, which detract greatly
fr.om its interest. The author allows
himself to dilate to such an extent on
a single subsidiary- Incident that the
thread of the story is resumed only
after an unbridged break in the narra
tive.
In his technical phraseology Spear
man falls into the same error which
Is so generally complained of by read
ers of Kipling. He takes It for granted
that his reader knows all about the
working parts of an engine, the stays
of a railroad bridge or the intricacies
of telegraphy, and rattles off his tech
nical terms so glibly that the unini

There Is no more unique- figure In
modern literature than Marie Corelll.
but of her personality the world knows
little. The task of portraying the wo
man as she is, of giving one a glimpse
behind the scenes of her life, has been
undertaken In a work recently pub
lished by George W. Jacobs & Co. of
Philadelphia, entitled "Marie Corelll.
the Writer and the. Woman," composed
by T. F. G. Coates and R. S. Warren.
BelL Miss Corelli, It appears, seta
"Ardath" above everything elsa she haa
written, and her biographers catalogue
it as "one of the author's finest effort*
to further the course of true religion."

wrote her a letter of commendation,
and the great Gladstone, after perusing
it, called upon her, and afterward
claimed her as a friend.
/'Richard Dallas."- whose detective
story, "A Master Hand," has been win
ning not a little ipralse, now stands re
vealed as Henry Wlnslow "Williams, a
prominent Baltimore lawyer. This ac
counts for the fact that the legal points
made In the book have an accuracy
that Is lacking In most fiction. The
Jaw is traditionally uncongenial to lit
erature, but fiction turns so frequently
on legal matters that a novelist might
do much worse than to get a working
knowledge of the law simply as a
preparation for his own profession,
while the recent examples of Mr. Wil
liams and Frederick Trevor Hill, au
thor of "The Minority" and "ThÂ«
Web," show that a busy lawyer can
turn his 'dally experience to good ac
count. Judge Robert Grant la another
example of the lawyer-novelist, but- he

his literature separate.

"^Certainly. .Mr. Howells*' persistent
plea for literature of life as It is. and.
rot as ."it used .to be three " hundred
years ago, is finding its answer in the
trend of the modern Â¦ novel. We . are
reading' stories about ourselves .nowâ
stories of business, of sociological con
ditions, of modern society. "The PiU"
"The ' .Relentless â¢ City,'.' "Brewster's
Millions," "Letters of "a S.elf-made
Merchant to HlÂ» Son" â these have tak
en the palm from the romantic stories
of two or three "years back, The few
tales of romance "which have found
.market ihls; year have 'been more or
.less failures. Despite the announce
ment of one of the- old line magazines
that they' would not have any "timely"
.articles for 1904. timeliness of.- spirit
â¢eems to be the feature of the leading
books of the day.
â¢That'the sea3on has been productive
of one. distinctive feature at least Is
.?h(twn by .the unquafified success which
has attended the fcubrcntloo of the
popularly styled politLcal novels. For
aver a year past several of the month
lies, nc-tably ' McClure's' with its work
by' Lincoln Ste ffens/ have' been arous
fpg.'-public interest In jthings pol.itlcal
to a " remarkable pitch. Following
.Closely upon this new* Idea came "The
Hops" by. Alfred Henry Lewis, and
.'The Mills of Men" by Philip Payne.,
These two novels, both written by
pejvspaper men who knew the game
from the ground up, have had an im
mense popularity and served -to point
the way. to- imitators of lesser lights.
The political novel will evidently have
a vogue. â¢ Â¦*.-..â¢-
Â¦ Be it not understood, however, that
any' disparagement is intended to be
cast at the sum total- of the year's
fiction. There have been" some excel
lent books written by stro. 3 authors;
there h*v*e also appeared to view some
npw â¢writers whose maiden efforts give
promise for. the â¢ future. New veins
have been developed and old' ones
Â¦touched in new manner. The season's
results have been distinctive but hard
ly epoch making.
As to what have been 'the *>est books,
that Is a question which admits of as
many, different answer's as there are
readers. '.The only approximation which
can be arrived at upon this -point IS
that : " suggested by ihe respective sales
of seme of the leading works 'of fictio'n.
John fox's "Little Shepherd of King
dom Come'* has .been among the lead
ers, sharing honors with Marion Craw
ford's "Heart' of Rome." Jack London's
remarkable story, "The 'Call of the
Wild." has received . a most flattering
Â¦weleome.and throughout East and West
has. been one of the best sellers of the
year. Qulller-Couch's "Hetty Wesley,"
Jatne? Lane Allen's "Mettle of the Pas
ture," Stanley Weyman'a "The Long
Night", afid Richard '-Whiting's "Yellow
Van". have, also been well .up in the lead
Â¦of the most popujar.. -fiction.
If se&ms to .have berti the character
istic of'*he book year that no' one work
.of fiction. has .stood forth prominently
as. the book of the year.'- It cannot be
sajd 'as In the past that Kipling's So

It was a momentary check to his sat
isfaction that he found as the train
was drawing toward Columbus that he .
had lost his puree. Columbu3 is no
place* for ja man who has -found his for
tune and lost his purse, and Prankerd
knew- it, and-he told "the condpetor that
he knew it. He. told him also that he
knew ihe general' superintendent, and
that this gentleman- would not be
pleased to hear ..that passengers on" his
train were -deprived of their parses.
Fortunately for the conductor the de
tective of the division was on the train
and he was immc-flia.tely advised of the
theft. ; â¢ . .
"How much .dough' was In that

recognizes among the. passengers any
known thieves. â¢ Izod began in the

recognized his old acquaintance, Peggie

times" were coming, when every one
would say in chorus that he believes
thfe price of real estate is going up, and ,
by' a flat of lies would Increase Its value
and make something out of nothing.;
.Lisle i Prankerd was one of those
whom the last , division of saving had
made happy. When he said that "good
times" * we're coming his words -were
bandied- from mouth to ~ mouth, and
every one who heard. them, instead of
being rationally sorry and ; tightening
his purse strings, was irrationally glad.
This cheerful unreason in a community
is called a spirit of business enterprise.
When it was known that h\ had bet
"good times" were coming and had
staked almost all he had realized on
his Interest In the Bank of the Occident
â that he had quietly bought options
on bits of town and. suburban property
for which there had hitherto been no
market â the , cheerful unreason became
more, cheerful and there. , was an In
stant disposition to 'back his bet.
WJiat checked their cheerfulness for
a moment at least was not that they
perceived Â¦ its unwisdom arid that back
ing .Prankerd's bet was precisely the
Vay to make him" win it and win It
from themselves, It was that Parlby
had made abet on the other side. He
had for a long time bought in what
'ever realty was offered at forced sale
in and about the city and had become
the largest holder "In the county. When
the "spirit of " business enterprise"
stood erect because of Prankerd's ln
' vestments Parlby reduced it at a stroke
to a state of limp dubiety and surmise;
he. began to offer his holdings for sale
at any. price, at whatever he could get.
Prankerd was admitted to be shrewd,
but it was Just possible he was "losing
his grip"; it was "quite certain Parlby
had "done" htm in! the matter of the
Bank of the. Occident.
Lisle Prankerd r did not want the
property which Parlby offered;, that
was why he bid it In. It was also why
Parlby offered more ' and yet more for
sale, and why Prankerd continued to
bid it in: until it became plain that if
the "good times" really did not come,
and that suddenly, the last man that
any one need. wish to become would be
Lisle. Prankerd.
When matters were in tjils posture a
card was brought one morning to
Prankerd at his office.
"Yes, It's me," said Peggie, entering;
"always on hand when I'm wanted,
and sometimes when I'm not. I've
come to 'talk business and you can send
away that ' young man If , you don't
want him yourself as a protection or a
witness; I want to place some 'dough';
to be understood that after a haaty
meeting of the directors Parlby was
held .to have overdrawn his personal
balance, and was in the trinlon of his
associates discredited. Parlby, the de
liberate opinion was, had been sacri
ficed. Justly enough because of his pri
vate, ventures, to 'save the bank. After
a* day -or 'two a definite account was
made public, but the account was too
"sensational" to obtain Immediate be
lief. What had happened In the Occi
dent was this:
On the morning of the day when the
panic had occurred a low. thick-set
man with shaggy whiskers and a hand
bag entered the Occident as if It be
longed to him and demanded to see the
president. The president's sanctum In
those days was a space apart, walled
off by slabs of plate glass a quarter of
an Inch thick and screened from vulgar
gaze by silk curtains in baby blue. The
visitor announced that he had business
of importance to both of them, and re-,
quested Mr. Parlby as they entered the
sanctum to give orders that they might
be uninterrupted. When this order had
been given and the door of the sane-*
turn was closed the visitor dropped his
handbag in front of his chair and with
one hand covered ParLby with a re
volver in excellent condition and with
the other produced a pint flask.
"I guess I've got the drop oa you.
pard. all right; don't move, 'causa I'm
kind o' nervous in m' fingers, and this
here gun's got a blamed, easy pull Be
sides, this flask's full o' nitro-glycerl-t
ine an' I might drop It, an' you an' me
an' the bank 'ud all make our bow In
hell -together. Sit down, careful like,
bo's not to set off no electric buttons,
nor alarms; there's no knowln' how
little "ud make me lose my hold on the
bottle. There, now, that's real homt
. like and comfortable â remind* me o*
mother. Suppose we talk."- ;\ V.
Parlby was not a coward; he said so
afterward, but he remembered, that he
was president of the bank and a citizen
of value in the community, to say noth
ing of his being engaged at the moment
to marry Miss Ansted of the San'Fran
cisco Ansteds. It was ; Parlby's steady
practice In life to say nothing of pri
vate motives when public motives could
honestly, be put "forward; and tht man
certainly did look as if he meant busi
ness, and nitro-glycerl-i-ine Is not to
be despised.
"It's up to you to do the talking,"
said Parlby, putting up a creditable
front. "As far as I see, you've' made
an ass of yourself, whoever you are. All
I've got to do is Just to sit quiet; you
can't get out of the bank; you couldn't
win clear In the street if you did get
out of the bank; you'll go to the pen
for this morning's Joke.. If there's any
thing to be said, it's you can say it."
"Sure! I'll say It fast enough. But
you can come oft your perch Just the
same. If I was leary of. the pen I
shouldn't be here, an' you know It. I'll
talk business with you, if that's what
you -want. I'm on my uppersâ see?
Either I get the dough I want or I
croak, 1 an' if you don't give me what I
want we croak together. You're my
last card, an' I'll play you, by God!
"What you say o* Just sittin' still 's
tommyrot. You make out a check pay
able to yourself for the sum I .name an'
have the- stuff brought In here an*
stowed away in that bag. /Or you've
seen your luck an' we'll both of uÂ»
know what's what." Â¦
Parlby's visitor had been speaking
with a fierce lntentness that was con
vincing. Parly thought him mad. Per
hape that was why he attempted to
reason with him.
"Even if I - got you the stuff and
stowed it away In that bag you
couldn't get away with It. You'd bet
ter talk sense. If you've got any. I'm
not to be bullied In my own office, with
forty clerks In call, armed as well as
you. That's the last word I have to
say, and be damned- to you."
"Mr. Parlby, you will take up. that
pen and write what I tell you. I take
my chances of getting away, .once the
stuff is in my hands. You won't give
an alarm till I've sot clear of the bank.
I can throw a flask on the floor outside
as well as here, an' you're much too
careful qf your skin to take any risks.
; You put up a bluff that I'm â¢ bug
house. Well. I'm not so bughouse but
I can see you're so scared of me you
can't sit in that chair without holdln*
on. You take up that pen an* write
what I tell you, an* be quick about it.
I'm kind o 1 nervous, as I said, an* this
gun's got a blamed easy pull an" the
outside o* this flask's kind o* slippery."
Parlby shrugged- his ; shoulders,
dropped his eyesâ and searched for a
pen. â¢ ' *Â¦
â¢ â¢ ' â¢ â¢
It is said that the special officer of
the bank and half a dozen. clerks start
ed in pursuit before the man with the
handbag:, had fairly reached the pave
ment. There must have been two men
with handbags; such coincidences hap
pen. , Possibly the coincidence wu not
accidental. At all events they assailed
a man with a handbag and so quickly
did the police patrol respond to the
private alarm from Parlby's office that
the man was not yet overpowered
when the wagon arrived. "When he was
taken into custody he proved to be the
wrong man, and the handbag proved
to' be the wrong handbag. It â¢ la possi
ble that this mistake might not have
been made if Parlby had personally
superintended the chase, bu$ he re
mained in his office; he was accurately
acquainted with the properties of nltro
glycerf-i-ine, which* Is quite as effec
tive in a paved street as in a marble
floored building, and though he may
have. had no regard for his own life -he
had other things than himself to think
of. lie thought of them.
The next day there wasfound In an
alleyway at the rear of the bank a suit
of clothes, a revolver and*a. flask, all
Identified by Parlby as belonging to the
robber. The flask was* found to con
tain sweet ell. "In the minds of some of
Parity's fellow citizens this discovery
confirmed the notion' that he had him
self contrived the robbery; In the
minds of others it served simply . to
make him ildlculous; in the minds of
all it still further discredited him. The
directors began to suspect they had
been mistaken in. their idea that Parlby
was Just the man they had long wanted
for president. Certainly, as it" after
ward turned out, he^had made a great
blunder in parting; with his real 'estate.
"'Peggie was. never again heard to* say
that she* would get even with' Parlby.
In' the" city of Blank there was little
of anything that she was again heard
to say; she soon closed out her inter
ests'there at a great ' profit , and : teft
the place, disappearing: Into the' be
yond,'where she still ' remains! f ..' '.
.It is Just possible that she feels she
has got even with Parlby, though It Is
Questionable whether she 'would hold
her hand if the chance should offer it
self, to get even with him again. All
things considered.. it is doubtful wheth
er Peggie's ruling trait Is gentleness.

The diningr-room in a colonial home
was one of its most attractive features,
and the housewife of to-day thaf can
boast of a sideboard and table fash
ioned years ago has something that Is
truly worth while. â¢
(Everything was built on a generous
scale, and the board that did- not
measure twenty-four Inches In depth
by seventy-two In length was not a
very good one. Hie top was plain, ab
solutely eo, and did not boast a mirror.
Of drawers there were three of goodly
size, two small ones and a large one in
the center, and the remainder of the
space I was taken up in compartments
built to correspond with the size of the
drawers. The dividing line between the
compartments was fashioned in post
style, which were slightly, carved; but,
with the exception of a fanciful scroll
on the top- of the board and a sugges
tion on the claw feet, the piece. stood
severe and simple, Its chief charm
being its great simplicity. \
The tables of long ago were every
bit as fetching. To be sure, there was
none of that dainty, cozy apartment
look about them, but they stood firmly
on four great legs that looked as
though they might be braced together
to hold up the load of good things that
the good old housewives used to take
such pleasure in preparing. Oftentimes
a. great square post, say a foot square,
formed the main brace, and the four
legs that joined on to the solid slab' of
wood were fanciful In shape, in order
to break up a too solid appearance, for
the underpart, or footrest, was nearly
always made/ of a . heavy piece of the
wood, which added to its weight. '
Probably the one relic of bygone days
that Is at all common is the great hall

swiftly 'passing away.' And how proud

from our factories.
mixed up in a dqzen rourh and ready
pillow fights a day.
The most charming and perhaps the
most useful of all the heirlooms is
what was and still Is called the "high
boy." In plainer words it is nothing
more or less than a chest of drawers,
originally intended for linen, and it de
rived its name from the fact that the
drawers were built as high as one could
conveniently reach.
That may be one thing that the mod
ern manufacturer has improve*! upon,
but the fact remains, nevertheless, that
he borrows his ideas from the time of
Waship^ton. The modern "high boy"
is tall but not as broad as one might
expect. Instead of opening drawer
fashion, it has double doors that lock
in the center and that give it a look
somewhat like the wardrobe. Inside
there are rows of drawers of various
sizes and shapes. There is a spacious
box that will easily hold two hats and
right next to it are small drawers that
are built Into compartments for gloves.
â¢X y OW is the time to delve head
/\ I first into the attic and store
\ y.rbom and bring forth In trl-
V. ."umph all. the relics of our
'grandparents' good old days. For you
all love them,- you know. Instead, of
leaving the. quaint old pieces as they
were, originally intended, they, were
spilt forth in great glee to maJke room
for the spindle-legged, uncomfortable
gilt affairs that are scarcely one thing
nor yet another, yet withal cost a prica
that flattened- thÂ» family wallet not a
little.
Cut, in turn, they are back to the
attic. Some v.ise old soul said If one
only k-ept things long enough they
would be the height of fashion, and so
it seems with furniture. One generation
you see it and the next you don't, but
it's in the house iust the same.
'And when one thinks of it, does it
not seem the height of folly to relegate
the. quant little rocking-chair that is
digr.ified with the name of Mayflower
to -the darkest corner that can be found
because, forsooth, Dame Fashion sol
emnly, swears and declares that
.svea'thered oaks or walnuts are to be
quite the proper caper?
Yet these little old rockers are perfect
treasures in themselves. In the first
place they are what hosts of our new
chairs are trot â comfortable. Generally
ih*y are low and broad, with a gener
ously curved back that is a decided joy
to weary he.a.ds. It only requires one
look "at them to picture a sweet-faced
woman in all the glory of hoops and
stlCiy starched beruffled skirts, rock
ing and industriously plying her busy
needle;.
And the -most graceful little table
?rer.erc.Hy finds Us way to the chair.
In fact, ore- fcarcely seems complete
yVithout the other. When dignified with
its own ram"e it is called the "candle"
table." as it bo often sat In the hall
covered with brass candlesticks ready
to b^ "lighted at dusk. In fact, just
at pre?ertf one may hear "at early can
dle lishtinjr," and the old time custom
of ' lishttnp: and handing a lady her
bedroom candle Is now one of the latest
pallantries of the day. This same little
tabJf fs .to be found freighted down
with a wealth jo-i candlesticks and it Is
a pretty- old fashion revived to go
twinkttns; uu the stairs like a small
torchlight procession.
As often as not the slender, fragile
lo.oking tab'.e sat by the rocker and
loaned its merry twinkle to its occu
pant ar.d. served as a work table and
*, general catch-all at the same time.
â¢ In the first place. It Is light in weight
tndso can be moved "about easily. And
it's small. Ridiculously eo. nine-tenths
of the women who work one day and
pla'y the next three would say, but
for. the one who never sits down and
idly folds her hands it is plenty large
enough. There is ample room for nap
kins that are to .be hemmed in odd mo
ments: for. the bit of embroidery that
Is to grace the table; for the trim little
collars thaf proclaim her the "soul of
neatness. And there's plenty of room
for a book or two a-nd. her work basket
never seems to be crowded out.
In short these two pieces of furniture
are a -ioy forever, tucked away in a
r'ory corner of the living room. And
that is Just where they belong, for
Vnen the family are sitting and chat
ting the little Mayflower rocks and
creaks sociably and the candle flickers
and announces to all within sight that
the 'corner is not inhabited by drones.
Of course it Is ever so much nicer If all
the furnishings of the room blend and
match to a nicety, for the color scheme
makes -or mars a room. But. unfortun
ately, tbe majority of us are not per-,
inltted to throw out what we don't like
and sally forth and invest in new if
the attic has not generously responded
.to the call for help.
But thanks be, this Is not the chief
-Importance, as good color effects may
be had at comparatively small expense
and we at least have one thing to be
grateful for. Artistic results, do not re
quire a lavish outlay of money and the
articles that cost a few pennies may
be spod shar>es and designs.
; Harmonious color effects depend al
most entirely on good taste and judg
ment, combined, to be sure, with some
email knowledge of the fundamental
â¢â¢principles of color schemes. And theor
ies. And that is one thing that a bar
rel of^ sold neyer could buy, for it is
not a matter of income but of refine
ment and education. The gold is not
to be despised by any manner of means,'
but charming and effective results may
be had on what most people would
call a mere bagratelle.
The good old davenports of yore are
vrorth a" dozen carved and fancifully
upholstered ones of to-day. They are
eo spacious and roomy and Inviting.
Generally they are almost severely
plain with gracefully curved arms to
relieve their unbending look, but they
are solid and substantial and will stand
any amount of .thrilling runaways and
not be the worse for wear if they get
bean ty. The backs, as a rule, are
quaintly interwrought, but are slender
looking, as, in fact, -Is the entire chair.
The : brocaded "covering may be Just
what one fancies the .most, but it
should be something dainty, for above
all things else this chair looks as
though its one idea was to grace a
drawing or a reception room.
What our grandfather used as his
own chair at the head of the table has
been brought down, rubbed- up and
given a hew seat and, lo and beholt*. it
puts some of the parlor chairs to
shame. . Mahogany Is always mahog
any, and in this day of its craze there
ft scarcely a stick of furniture that is
not fit to grace our best rooms. These
dining chairs are simple, without even
a hint of carving, and the back, which
Is rather broad, is a shining panel of
exquisitely polished wood. Under the

dsiiin Â¦ iimuaS ily along the , wids
range, sang Â° aloud
for very Joy of Iight-heartedr.ess. Out
here, away from cities and crowds, how
good life was. . -^.C:
The train was in, and Atherley hur
ried around the corner, then halted sud
denly, dazzled by the vision which con
fronted him. On the lower steps of
a car near the middle of the train-stood
a girl, her fair hair blowing in the wind,
her hands full of pink roses, her eyes
gazing straight into his. For a second'
neither moved. Then, as a voice from
within called "Marion." the girl, with,
a quick flush, turned up the steps, and
Atherley, stricken with the conscious
ness of his dusty "chaps," huge spurs
and sombrero, slipped back. He had
quite forgotten his letter. The engine*
gave a preliminary snort, the conduc
tor yelled "All aboard!" but Atherley
still stood motionless, his eyes fixed
on the car wherein she had disappeared:
As the slow length of train began te
move the girl slipped back to the plat
form for a moment, and on the ground,
almost at Atherley's feet, fell a pink
rose. To spring forward, seize ' the
flower, then swing aboard the last car
as It passed Â»was to Atherley but the
work of another moment. Before, he
had fairly realized it be was on the
train and speeding: eastward as fast as
steam could carry him.
Practical thoughts forced a way, and
his first act. was to take account of
stock-
"Jlm will take the horse back." he.
reasoned. "It's all risrht. Luckily I
have Just about enough for my ticket
to New York." Somehow he had .de
cided that she lived in New York. "And
as for meals. "Well, who knows what
ma> turn-up?" with cheerful optimism.
At the next stop he sneaked forward
to the smokins car and sat down to
think things over. She was certainly
a mighty pretty girl! Atherley. feel
ing for the rose hidden in his breast
pocket, concluded that he would prob
ably, not regret his action.
â¢â¢But I've got to get busy on the food
question."
There were three or four other men
in the car, the younger ones chatting
together, and another, rather older,
reading in a corner. All eyed him
curiously, and Atherley had an Inspi
ration. If he wocked th*m j right,
amused them, told them queer experi
ences, they might supply him with
food and drink, and as .for cigars, well*
he must husband those he had . care
fully. In pursuance of this idea, he
moved nearer, and soon neld , the group,
enthralled with bis breezy frankness:
'.'So you really Just Jumped on the"
train and came," asked an older man at
length, when Billy had grown aweary
of his task and moved away, "and for
no other reason than that you^wanted
to see the world?" Atherton laughed
rather shamefacedly. -- 1 .-
â¢That's what I told those fallows.
But I don't mind telling you the truth.
It wasâ it was on account of a girl,'!
he said haltingly. The older man's
lips twitched.
"A girl! How so?" -'^y'
"I saw- her on the car stepr,** con
fessed Atherley. "Andâ and I liked
her," he ended lamely, not- even tb
himself did he care to mention tKe
rose. "I wonder If you have seen
her," he added eagerly. "She had on.
some kind of a blue skirt with a white
waist and carried some roses. â¢They
called her 'Marion.' "
The older man started.
"Marion," he exclaimed, "why, that's
my daughter," unthinkingly. Then hjÂ»
stopped, rather annoyed. A -yoimg.
ranchman, no matter how charming
and gentlemanly, was hardly a person
to be presented to the carefully guard
ed Marion. But Atherley was too ab
sorbed to notice the hesitation.
"Your daughter," he cried. "Raalrjr.
your daughter, oh, I say, what luck!
That will save me an awful lot of Urns
and trouble. 1 expected the deucÂ« of
a Job In locating her. Though I knew
that I should do It In the end," ha.
added confidently. "Do you mind tell-,
ing me your, name?"
"My name," divided between Lndlj
natldn and mirth. "I am James Ar
buthnot," he declared rather pompous
ly. But Atherley was clearly, unim
pressed.
"Better and better," he, cried. "I
always was a lucky devil," Joyously.
The elder man leaned back and stared
at him.
"My dear young man," began he In,
hla most formal manner. "I think we
must understand' each other. I cer
tainly fail to see where the luck comes
in." Atherley, staring in his turn, be
came suddenly enlightened.
5'Of course. You mean that you don't
know me." he cried. "Oh, that's all
right," easily. "I've heard dad speak
of you hundreds of times. I'm Billy
Atherley, and I've Just been out look
ing up some properties In the "West."
The older man's brow cleared some
how.
"Not William H. Atherley's son?" â¢
Atherley nodded. : .
"The same. So now won't you in-*
troduce me to your dausrhter?'* wist
fully. "It would save such a lot of
time." :
Arbuthnot, his gray eyes twinkling:,
looked at the young fellow quizzically.
' "If vou ore much like your father,,

hardly aot to wait Ions for my ser
vices," be remarked Jocosely. .'."Come
along, then. All I ask of you is please

stern, but young Atherley laughed hap
pily.
"I make no promises,", he declared,
with gay defiance. '. "Oh, here.hcJd on
a moment," as a sudden recollection of
his unmailed letter recurred ,to ') him.
Pulling out the envelope, he 'tore it
into fragments, letting the pieces float
out of the open window.

THE GOOD OLD DAYS OF

10HISTORIC SCENES IN THE BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS
â¢Jk yOTHING is more significant of
f\ I the inauguration of good feeling
t N- and mutual understanding be-
V. tweefc Great Britain and Ireland
than the almost universal esteem in
which the present Lord Lieutenant of
Irelandâ Earl Dudleyâ is held. Out of
the great number of . titled nobodies
â¢who have been sent over from Eng
land and Scotland to govern Ireland
you oouia count on the. fingers of one
hand these Vho made themselves popu
lar with- the Irish masses. Most of
.them did not make a ripple on the sur
face.' They enjoyed for a short time
the honeymoon of high official life in
Dublin, surrounded by pomp and dis
play and military honors. They gave
receptions and -balls and held military
reviews. They -delivered addresses be
fore â¢ agricultural societies, in which
â¢thÂ«y tried to. show how the country
..wes progressing* while history shows It
was, at the time, on the toboggan slide.
Of a truth they neither knew nor cared
a. brass farthing about tne economic
or. social conditions of the country.
.Their knowledge of the Irish peasant

a few. years ago as the "most distress

old sj-Etem is doomed, however, and the
official vampires must go.
The British statesman, Joe Chamber
lain,, twenty years ago, well described
the condition of affairs then existing in
By j: J.'Tobin
Ireland. "The system," said he, "by
which this free nation attempts to rule
the sister country is as completely cen
tralized and bureaucratic as that with
which Russia governs Poland or as that
which prevailed in Venice under the
Austrian rule. An Irishman at this
moment cannot move a step, he cannot
lift a finger in any parochial, municipal
or educational work without being con
fronted with, interfered with, controlled
by an English official, appointed by a
foreign Government and without a
shade or shadow of representative au
thority. I say the time has come to
reform altogether the absurd and ir
ritating anachronism which is known
as Dublin Castle." Since these words
were spoken the wings of this "an
achronism" have been clipped by the
local government act, which gives the
people the right to elect their county
officers, but the administration of many
Important departments of the Govern
ment is still in the hands of Dublin
Castle. As no great statesmanâ be he
Tory or Liberalâcan now defend the
system, another one more democratic
and up-to-date must soon be found.
Spain sent her governors general and
swarms of minor officials to fatten on
the Cubans and Filipinos and continued
the system until the worms upon which
she trampled turned and stung her. As

When King Edward and Queen Alex
andra visited Ireland recently the Lord
Lieutenant, Earl Dudley, piloted them
around the country. He is only 36
years of age and comes of a very old
English noble stock, but there Is noth
ing of the cad or snob. about him, al
though he Is a Tory- When the offi
cials of Dublin Castle tried their old

Mulgrave, who was appointed Lord
Lieutenant in 1835, was deservedly pop
ular. Daniel O'Connell said of him,
"He is filling the office of King's rep
resentative in a manner in which an
Irish Chief Governor never filled it
before."
Lord Carnarvon, "who was appointed
to the same office in 1S85 by Premier
Salisbury, was a statesman of great
ability and world-wide experionce. He
became convinced that the only solu-
.intimate inenas, wno Decame very pop

of his avowed sympathy with their
national aspirations and his zealous ef
forts to promote their Industrial inter
ests. The Countess, his wife, heartily
co-operated with him and her labors
bore great fruit in the patronage and
support given to certain line*? cf manu
facture which formerly flourished in
Ireland. Irish poplins, Irish lace, Irish
embroideries, found ready sale among
the ladies of high degree. When Lord
of Lord Carnarvon, the Tory Irish Gov
ernors regarded the massesâ the mere
Irish â as not. worthy! of their notice.
As a prominent Irish' member of Par
liament put it, "They hated us and we
hated them in return." Under the new
departure the Tories, to quote a say-
Ins of Disraeli, "found the Liberals in
bathing and stole their Â¦- clothes.'.' In
copsequenee the name of Tory no long
er conjures up tales of grinding land
lord oppression, of coercion laws and
ruthless extermination. Acts of jus-
game of shutting him up In their pre
serves he resisted, and said: "I am
going among the people and will find
out things for myself. I am going
through Ireland on my automobile."
"Alone?" cried the officials. "It is mad
ness, my lord; you will be assassi
nated." "No, not alone; Lady Dudley
is going with me." The' automobile
trip was a triumphant success. Often
they would stop at .a peasant's cot
tage, ask for a glass of milk and chat
with the family. They did not go to
the big country houses, the seat of this
or that nobleman, but put up *at coun
try inns and partook of the humblo
fare provided. Lord Dudley would
drink 'an Irish whisky punch at the
parochial residence and chat with ths
priest about the condition of affairs In
the surrounding country. *When he re
turned to Dublin he had/ made hosts
of friends everywhere and there was
hardly a phase of Irish life with which
he was unfamiliar. He la now the own
er of a beautff ul country * home at
Boyle, almost in the heart of Ireland,
and- there dispenses hospitality- of
"cead mille faltha" proportions. It is
not uncommon to see Lord and Lady
Dudley in the streets of Dublin arm
in arm, without police or military es
cort, like ordinary plain people, shop
ping or visiting bazaars and places
where they can do some practical good.
When the Wyndham- land bill was un

In Its passage, would be frequently ob

Dudley owes- much of his success to
his wife. She is a beautiful woman
and fills also the requirement of Solo

est daughter of Charles Gurney, the
great Quaker banker. Like her pre
decessor in the viceregal residence.
Lady Aberdeen, she believes in cor
dially co-operating with her husband
in, making his administration popular
and successful. "It Is not right," said
Lady Dudley, "that we should draw
large revenues from the poor and never
trouble ourselves about how they live
and how they get tha money which
they pay us." She has spent a great
deal of time and money helping chil
dren's hospitals and orphanages. | She
has given great financial aid to differ

many poor country districts by Sir

their sincerity and disinterestedness.

in rum 50 to CO per cent. In the above
tables the quantities of spirits are all
reduced to a common standard of 50
per cent of alcohol, and the figures are
strictly comparable. â¢ Wine contains

from 6 to as much as 25 per cent. The

Some few years ago the late Mr. Mul

be only approximate, and he only used
It for purposes of comparison. It is in
teresting to compare the consumptlbn
of alcohol per head with this estimate
-of Income, which comparison Is made
in the. same diagram, where the blank

between the two, the most notable ex
'ceptions being in the cases of Norway

as to the strength of English and Ger

bility not a great difference between"
them. The figuTes for the consumption

In order to estimate the quantity of

this, as has been sta'tcd. Is. exactly cor

for the reason mentioned above In
speaking about the wine consumed in

estimate may cause the .consumption

Â¦wh.ile .the consumption of wine remains
almost stationary. The increase from

is for snirits.7 tier cent an<3 for beer
nearly- 10 per cent. Thus, contrary to
an opinion, which is frequently held,
the consumption of beer is increasing

Lrss Drunkenness, but More Drinking.
The decrease of drunkenness, which
Mx. Booth remarks is not perhaps so
great 'a benefit to the nation as a dim
inution in the amount of liauor con
sumed would be, for the physical harm
done by alcohol is frequently quite in
dependent "of any visible state of in
toxication. It is the man whe "niDS,"
â¢ but is never drunk, who finally suc
cumbs, to cirrhosis or other forms of
alcoholic poisoning.
. It will be e'vident from these consid
erations that the actual amount of alco
h6l'consumed by a nation is *no guide
to the amount of drunkenness preva
lent, and in fact some nations whose
consumption, of alcohol per head is high
are .distinguished for their sobriety.
Th'e ' following diagram shows the
quantities- of -spirits, beer and wine con
sumed- per head in the chief countries
of Europe and in the United States.
The diagram is based on the figures of
the most recent available year, usually

fact that where- there is much shading
there is, .as a rule, very little left white,

swiftly down the floor, take his seat.
He had, however, come to stay, and
meant to deliver "a carefully prepared
speech. As he stood and shouted the
beginning of sentences, the crowded
house, now in for a lark, persistently
bellowed. This was the . occasion
when, as was written at the time, the
late Cavendish Bentlnck "went out be
hind the Speaker's chair and crowed
thrice." Certainly cock crowing was
added to other more familiar parlia

THE first time I chanced, to be

waters of the House of Com

years ago. Mr. Gladstone was In the
course of his first premiership, and
the historic Parliament elected in 186S
was slowly dying. On what should
have been a quiet Tuesday sitting Sir
Charles Dllke rose to move for an In
quiry into the civil list, the extrava
gance of wn'.ch he had a short time
earlier denounced at a public meeting.
Sir Charles, standing at the corner
seat of the front bench below the
gangway, since occupied by him under
varied crcumstances, got along well
enough. He at least managed to
make himself heard. But what he
said got the back up of a loyal ma
jority, and when Mr". Auberon Her-^
bert rose to second the motion he was
greeted with persistent cries of '"vide,
'vide, 'vide." *- " â¢ '
Three years- later, having succeeded
to the Premiership, Mr. Disraeli
found himself confronted with a
scene even more dramatic than that
which distressed Mr. Gladstone in
1872. August was at hand, and the
usual statement of bills thrown over
board was made. Among them was
the merchant shipping bill, in charge
of Mr. Plimsoll. -In those days it was
open to an aggrieved member to dis
lodge ordered business and arbitra
rily occupy the time of the House by
moving the adjournment Mr.-Plim
soll availed himself of this privilege,
beseeching the Premier, in a voice
choked , with emotion, not to consign
some thousands of men to death. The
merchant shipping bill was designed
to check the . practices of a class of
men whom Mr." Plimsoll as
"ship knackers," who bought at a low
price unworthy ships, insured them,
sent them to sea, and when they foun
dered, I as they usually . did, .. pocketed
the spoil. Mr. Plimsoll's excited de
meanor, his scarcely veiled accusation
of a particular member, wrought the
House to a high pitch of excitement.
The Speaker repeatedly calling him to
order, Mr. Pl'msoll darted forward,
waving aloft , a Â¦ piece of paper, and
standing In the middle of the floor' he
had continued some ten minutes, a
member jealous of thej reputation of
the House, spied strangers. The gal

business of the day was the moving of
a new batch of standing orders de
signed to clip the wings of obstruction.
Mr. Gladstone rising to move the first
resolution found himself faced by Mr.
Dillon, who refused to resume his seat
when called upon by the Speaker. He
was forthwith named, and ordered to
withdraw. This he refused to do un
til a posse of messengers under com
mand of the sergeant-at-arma ap
proached. Thereupon he surrendered.
On his withdrawal Mr. Parnell moved
that Mr. Gladstone be not heard. A
scene of indescribable tumult fol

refusing, the reserves were again
called out. Four venerable messen

11having been allowed to chaperon any
children through the ways of sorrow
and milk bills before the advent of
Alfred, they didn't know how many
other fond parents had made the mis
take of concluding that the only thing
necessary to set the feet of intelligent
human beings on the right road is to
point it out to him. If this were all of
life it would be so simple a matter that
most of the fun would be eliminated.
The joy of living in this world comes
principally from the opportunities that
are given us to prove to our friendly
advisers that they don't know what
they are talking about. The simple
fact that disagreeable advice turns out
to be correct ninety-nine times out of
a hundred has nothing to do with the
case. The pleasure comes from bet
ting that our case Is going to be the
hundredth.
In order 'that Alfred might not get
mixed on the points of the moral com
pass his parents went into executive
cession at an early stage and voted
unanimously to make a prompt and
regular' attendance at church twice a
day on Sundays a sine qua non, with
a little dose of s Sunday-school and mid
week prayer-meeting for a diversion.
Thus it appears that Alfred was
doomed to an early death or a subse
quent hanging from the beginning of
his life. Statistics show that at 'least
ninety per cenj of the murderers of
this country, including Brooklyn and
Pi ttsburg, were sent to church regu
larly In their early youth.
Another idea that they evolved out
of their subliminal consciousness,
wherever that is, was that the boy who
was always well dressed was Immune
from a great many different kinds of
sin to which the more shabby portions
of the community were subject. The
logical conclusion from this sort of rea
soning would make the dressmaker and
the .tailor more potent forces in the
purifying and uplifting of mankind at
largeâ and keeping it at largeâ than
all the preachers from the first Elijah
to the late John Alexander. However,
reason "has very little to do with the
training of one's own children;, men
and women who could do wonders with
the lawless offspring of other people if
they could only get a whack at them
fall down flat when It comes to con
trolling their own Infant industries.
ONCE upon a time there were a
â¢couple of lineal descendants of
Adam and " Eve who had been
favored with a sample of Jiu

.to which they had attached the al
luring label- of- Alfred, In order that
he might. -live a respectable life and

It Is a well known psychological fact
that 'men named Alfred are' seldom dis
covered .straying outside the narrow
path that leads Ho the realms of the

to penetrate that favorite stamping'
ground of the great unwashed Ameri
can democracy, the pride of our states
men, and the subject on which our
orators shout themselves hoarse when
ever they run out of other subjectsâ
the public school. Alfred could go only
to the most select Institution, patron
ized by the very best people, at so
much per patronize. Measured by the
price, their idea was a good one, but.
alas ! the things that cost the most are
not always the most worth having.
The only exception to the above rule Is
In the case of experience; the more
that costs the more valuable it Is, and
It's about the only valuable that all
men can afford. '.
But we must return to Alfred before
he grows up and leaves us. At 10 years
of age he held the record as all around
model child of the block and was the
Bpedal detestation of all the other kids
for,- a radius of a half a mile around.
He was unable to walk â¢ abroad dur
ing the snowball season without a po
lice escort, and even brickbats were
sometimes drawn to him in a most un
accountable manner. In fact, he could
give the late John Philip Orpheus
points as the great human magnet. He
represented the family at church and
Sunday school regularly and his high,
pale intellectual brow was one of the
principal sights of interest In Dr. Cram
men's select shop for the manicuring of
the youthful mind.
From this time on, however, a change
comes over the fond but foolish dream
of- Alfred's parents. In spite of the
many pious injunctions that he had
received not to associate with any chll-
Captain "Harry** Leonard. has like
wise beheld the front of war. and In. its
sternest aspects. He took active part
before he was twenty-fire years of age
In three warÂ»â In Cuba, In the Philip
pines and In China. . During the Tien
tsin campaign he risked his life by go-
Ing to the rescue of a wounded com
rade, carrying him to safety on his
back across a fire swept field, and list
his left arm as a penalty for his
achievement. If he had been en Eng
lishman the Victoria Cross, prized be
yond all other decorations of the sol
dier, would have been bestowed upon
him.
Tbe other officers as social aids at the
White House are Captain Thomas Jef
ferson Lewis of the Second Cavalry;
Lieutenant Orenvllle Roland .Fortescue,
of the Fourth. Cavalry; Lieutenant
Clarence O. Sherrill, of the Engineers.
and Lieutenant Ernest D. Peek, of the
Engineers. Lieutenant Fortescue. it
might be mentioned, is a cousin of the
President, and much liked - by the
Roosevelt family-
There was a time when one or two
military aids at the White House were
all that were required. But nowadays
it Is different. The social business of
the President has grown' enormously,
and more people are needed to transact
It. At public receptions somebody must
Introduce the people to Mr. Roosevelt,
and that duty, absorbs the attention of
Colonel Symons, but the efforts of a
number of subordinate officers are suit
ably and usefully employed In keeping
In order the line of oncoming and im
patient guests. However, a very Im
portant part of their work Is to lend,
with their gold-laced uniforms, decora
tive effect to what would be called on
the stage the mis-en-scene.
But, as a matter of course, the White
House aids are supposed to be avail
able for any kind of social duty. As an
almost invariable rule they are bach
elors, and .In that capacity are useful
as sauires of dames. Whenever young
men are wanted as dinner partners for
young lady guests they are always at
hand. It is Impossible for them to get
away. As a matter of military disci
pline they must be ready to â¢ break
bread gracefully, utter agreeable flat
teries, and even dance like the prover
bial moonbeam on a frogpond. If there
be demand for such terpsichorean ex
ercise.
Two officers of the Marine Corps hav*
been selected as aids at the executive
mansion for the social seasonâ Major
Charles McCawley and Captain Henry
M. Leonard. Both are Washington men.
The former has been conspicuous In
the society of the capital for more than
a dozen years, and during the Bantiago
campaign In Cuba proved himself a
brave and capable soldier. He Is hand
some and accomplished, very popular
and an athlete. If It be added that he
Is one of the best dressed men In .Wash-,
ington his description will bÂ« fairly
complete.
The social aids for the winter at the
White House are greatly prized, the
work Involved being nothing more than
to helo the President in the- business
of entertaining the publlo.
The origin of the custom of assign
ing officers to duty of this kind at the
White House Is somewhat obscure, but
nothing, obviously, could be more prop
er than that thÂ« President, as com
mander In chief of the national forces,
should be helped at the* publlo recep
tions and on other Important occasions
by military aids. â¢

Therefore, the proud parents who were
responsible for Alfred's presence in the
world were not bothered with logical
conclusions in the handling of their
particular entry and decked him out in
r a Lord Fauntleroy suit that was cal
culated to embitter permanently the
heart of any right-minded child.
' Another theory to which they clung
with a pertinacity worthy of a better
causeâ or boy â was' that no Belf-re
specting parents can be too careful of
the children with whom their contribu
tion to the sum total of human suffer
ing associates. No vulgar street gam
ins for their Alfred; he might fore
gather only with the representatives of
families of culture and Incomes similar
to their own. Nor must he be allowed
dren whose fathers did not have In
comes of at least five figures and cul
ture on draft in proportion, drtad ru
mors began to come to their ears from
people who had heard other people say
that thev had seen the little Alfred,
he of the glassy fashion and the moldy
form, playing In the street with vulgar
children whose Immediate ancestors
were probably in trade or JaJJ.or some
thing equally lacking in gentility. He
began to rebel also at the Lord Fauntle-'
roy outfit in which tney persisted In
confining him: a pair oU>lue overalls
and a calico shirt were more In keep
ing with his frame of mind. It was
even rumored that he had played
hookey from school to go In swimming
off the dock and when he came home
from Sunday school with his lace collar
looking as though he had bought it at
a bargain counter their hearts were
more or less filled with woe. _
At last. In desperation, they sent him
to a boarding-school for boys, where
he would be spared any contact with,
the hol polloi or anything that looked
like it. This was the finish of Alfred.
The first vacation that found him again
In the home of his fathers, likewise his
'mothers, demonstrated to his loving
parents that they had put their money
'on the wrong horse, or else the race
was being pulled in a most distressing
Â¦manner. His fingers were stained to a
beautiful brown with difficult experi
ments in the chemical laboratory, he.
| Informed his parents; and what he
'didn't know about the wickedness of
jthls world wasn't taught at the school
that he attended. However, they held
>on yet a little longer in the hope that
â¢ there might be a reversion of form.
They even sent him to college that hs
might be separated from some o{ his
rnost painful habits, but all In vain.
.The last that was heard of the sainted
'Alfred was .on the occasion of his being
united In the holy bonds of matrimony
to an accomplished young lady who
presided over the cashier's desk in a
lunch room next door to the institution
of polite learning where Alfred was
sojourning for the time being. It Is
rumored that he Is now the general
'manager of the Information bureau at
;tho railroad station In the same place â
[a position for which his peculiar train
ring and left-footed education fit -him
admirably. \
! There Is a general consensus of. opin
ion among the observers of Alfred's ca
.reer that those who desire to start a
â¢boy In the way be should go .will do
'-well to ' conceal their intentions from
â¢the boy; also that It is not always wise
to pick the smoothest roads. ,

takes good care that no one. around
her shall escape the overweening hap
piness she finds in misery.
Of course, the man blessed with
such a blessing thinks it his inalien
able right to manage her, but I re
peat that a man who undertakes to
manage a woman who does not want
to be managed is about as reckless as
the fellow who sits on a keg of dyna
mite and smokes a pipe. Maybe he
thinks there will be no explosion, but
the chances are that he will be blown
Into such smithereens that there will
not be enough of him left to do duty
as a respectable corpse.
THE woman wno Has t>een wooect
and won baa been to the man In
the case a" dead easy proposition,
but if he thinks he can manage
her later on he will find himself
up aeaiirst a snarl that will perforce
teach him that he is still at the foot
of the kindergarten class' of human
nature. Â¦ .
. â¢ If a^ly man ever succeeded in manag
ing a woman who did not want to be
.managed he must have served a long
apprenticeship in taming- all sorts of
wild samples of the. feline variety in
the Zoo; because the minute a woman
scents the fact that a descent is being
made en her- personal and private rights
and- privileges, and that the husband
tbjijks he should 1 ' control a certain cor
ner, of the "back fence, that minute the
lady.of the story' begins, like the felines
of the Zoo, to show her various claws
and sharp little teeth and -does a lot
of spitting: and snarling: on her own ac
count, whereon -somebody gets hurt,
and it is not" the. lady.
Now, a -woman wants to be tbe one
â¢cpler possessor of the exclusive rights
to the time, place, occupation and af
fection of the man! whom she' calls
husband', and if. she really loves him
she will not- stand for any filibustering
on the. Dart or outsiders.
.' But the -.man who Â¦. attempts to do
the. managing must be a colossus of
strength, tact and in-geniousness' that
will teach him to sidestep quickly when
â¢he finds himself trespassing on dan
fenjus pfround..
â¢ Tbe woman* wh,o may not care a rap
about woman's rights as far as suf
frage and other- meddieserrne propen
sities or exhibitions of- herself are con
cerned will be : an- awlul stickler for
matrini6nial and homestead rights, the
maintaining' ,of which she .will insist
upoo even," .If 'she has to- accent the
proposition with a club, a cowhide or
an q!d fashioned broom handle. .
New. the. -mas who enters' the mat
rimonial holies of holies .should do so
with- a proper appreciation as well as
reverential jiwefiue the situation. He
Ehould be *s wise and slick and silent
as 'a Eerpent, wilh something of the
dogCke fidelity, the hcrrselike sagacity
and .the catlike porrins: affection, if he
woujd wisely .rule. The 'minute â¢ he as-
Eumfes the .bear or the boar role he
will find- h.ixriselt opposed by . catlike
agility and cunning that will more than
offset acy .straggle recklessly entered
upon. " Â¦
Of course, a- man always thinks him
self the superior, and the tactful woman
never awakens him from the pipe
dream, but wiiile we know the man Is
right, yet ?or the Bake of domestic
peace . 'tis better to let the wife think
that hie mental pendulum swings way
beyond the offside when compared with
her.
â¢Always tell her that she looks well.
There is where a man-should be sure
to lie in self-defense. The man who
Bays. "My dear, you 'look like a full
blown chrysanthemum." or, "My love,
you look charming and are the hand
eomest woman in the bunch,", or, "My
dear, 1 do not know any woman who
can compare with you," insures a per
ennial house warming and lays up a
cinch when he wants to go duck
shooting with the boys. While the
man who brutally contemplates his
Â¦wife's fading charms and sneers, "You
get uglier* every day . you live," or,
"You wrinkled old" crpw, do you think
I am ceing to be your escort?" kindles
a few bonfires of wrath which; if they
do not scorch : hlm a bit, will emit
euch "it beastly . unpleasant lot of
6moke aÂ» he "will be In no small hurry
to escape. - " . - ' â¢
There are women who grow more
beautiful in maturity, other* become
so cgly thit they would make good
old fashioned cornfield scarecrows,
but a man contemplating the awful
ness and the; dire uncertainties of mat
rimony should make op his mind to
a martyf-llke patience and await
time's' development of his spouse.
, The' man who loves, beauty, in a
woman 'should take an inventory of
the /family showing of the previous
generation. The girl whose mother
still retains her good looks is apt to
inherit the like charm, while the girl
whose mother has transformed into
an ugly oid parchment product is sure
to follow in the same wake.
In these days when old ladles are
decidedly out of reckoning, when
dames of 60 wear picture hats and
refuse to grow old, the man who
wants his wife to be up-to-date should
carefully select such a woman as,
Judging from her mother, will stand
the wear and tear of matrimony with
the insidious little tricks of time scat
tered along the road.
So tell a woman that she is pretty
and sweet' even if you do not mean it;
It may have the pleasing tendency of
making her so. Anyhow, it will be
less brutal than the truth and she will
be more docile under the treatment.
If she wants to do anything, if you do
not incline the earns way, convince her
gently and diplomatically that she re
ally does not want anything of the
kind. It may take some little lying
and astute generalship to accomplish,
but a husband who is not a strategist
is a dead, rank, blank failure.
' Never deny her anything. Put her
off persuasively if you must, tell her
you forgot it, or that the dearest wish
of your heart is to go "broke," bank
rupt or anything on the calamity sched
ule. In gratifying her whims.
. Never say that you cannot afford Itâ
a woman hates pauperismâ but just
tell her 6he will have to wait a little
while. Of course she will wait and
keep on waiting, but as long as she
really believes you she will be more
amiable.
Always be pleasant, and if you want
to Bwear, why swear at the other fel
low â it will afford you Just as much
relief and she will not feel so sore. Of
course a gentleman never swears at
his wife, but men who think themselves
gentlemen forget once in a while.
When you come home at night full â
of (balloon juice, or) worry or any
other old thing, or if your corns have
a'Jumplng toothache, don't mind a lit
tle thing like that, but smile (or take
a smile) serenely and tell her what a
bore it Is to have to meet the fellows
at the club and absent yourself from
home and her. If you say it with the
proper emphasis she will really believe
you.
Always do everything she asks of
you. even if it be to saw wood, and
the man who won't saw wood for his
wife does not deserve her.
Be sure to tell her that her hats are
prettier and more tasteful .than .any
woman's you know. The man who
praises another woman to his wife is
ripe for lunatlco- inqulrendo proceed
incs. or is a perfect brute.
Always concur in whatever she may
say or do. It lubricates the wheels of
the domestic machinery.
The really successful husband, If he
has not cultivated tact and a few other
virtues, should take a course of instruc
tions.
The most successful husband in the
world is the really amiat>le liar. \ He
does not start out to lie, but he finds
that it pleases a wife to have her own
way always, consequently he gets into
the habit of saying nice things rather
than ruffle her temper, or hurt her feel
ings, .and there he stays. . â¢â¢ . '-'
Now, every one knows there
are many women whom no man on
earth. could please; women, who, if
they nad the whole earth, would cry
for half a dozen moons for toy bal
loons, and would even envy Miss Sat
urn of her belts. They were cut on
the bias in the beginning, and all the
pulling and fixing in creation would
never jerk them out on a straight,
even line.
A man must study such a woman.
I don't envy him his job, yet if he will
get married he. must bear it like a
little man.
Some women are about as com
fortable to live with as would We walk
ing on broken bottles. They are dis
pensations of Providence that no one
can figure out why they were dispen
sated, unless it be to either make us
ripe for heaven, or overripe for the
other place. If a man finds himself
entangled in that kind of dragnet he
should not be blamed if he escapes, if
he can, but unfortunately . such a
woman is generally endowed with a
glutinous sort of grim determination
that hangs on, no matter how strenu
ously a man may kick.
jjj It is your spiteful, jealous, disagree
able woman who will not get rid of a
man either to please him or to please
herself. She enjoys the misery with
such a sense of satisfaction that she

Every child should have. a playroom
Â¦oi some. kind. It may be only a corner
In; the sewtaB-room for the baby; a
corner in the garret'for the older child;
a room th the barn or basement for the
boy; but there should be some place
which the child can call his own. Many
parents, will spend much time and
money to provide a suitable place for a
.h&rse, a. dog or even the birds of the
ajr, yet never consider that their own
dear children have no place in which
. they, can be perfectly free. The re

with whom he plays are such as will
aid him in developing influences and
feelings along right lines, rather than
in the opposite direction.
Because of the great Influence of
playmates, parents should be guided by
this consideration in the selection of a
residence. They should also consider
carefully the \ selection of a place for
the child's education and the selection
of the school. This important matter
should also be considered in the selec
tion of servants. In very many cases
the parent can have but little to say
concerning these matters. However,
this is no reason why attention should
nqt be called to the importance of the
subject. Where the parent can possibly
do so he should take great Interest in
seeing that the school which this child
attends is taught by a teacher whose
influence is what it should be. Next to
the parents there Is no one person who
will ' probably exert such a, lasting In
fluence, upon most developing charac
ters as do the teachers and compan
ions.

'^hey should be such that their In

truths of right living. If they are such
as to give the Impression that luck is
more apt to determine success than
careful playing, or that dishonest play
is the best way to secure the desired
end, a false idea is likely to be im
pressed and stick to them the rest of
their lives. By such' games endless
numbers of bright young men have
early been trained for dishonest lives.
Nearly every child will have some
playmates, either good or bad. Which
It shall be will be determined by
chance, partly by the wish of the child,
chairs and discarded - toys by others.
No parent Is too poor to provide such
as would be greatly appreciated by his
own children. Is it not worth think
ing about?
Every boy and girl should find more
amusement at home In the evening
than in any other place. The home
games for. the young- and the old should
be more interesting than those which
can be found elsewhere. Many a girl
and many more boys would have
been saved from lives of shame had
some effort been made by the parents
to provide suitable home amusement.
Parents should remember that chil
dren are sure to have amusements; if
not those selected by the parents, then
those selected by themselves or by
their companions, whose Judgment it is
frequently not safe to trust. The ques
tion to decide is, whether it is better
to help them select amusements which
are beneficial, or. leave . them entirely
free to select their own , amusements,
which are likely to be injurious. To
ask the Question- is to answer it..
As before indicated, the character of
a child's amusements is very import-'
ant What they shall be is for 'each'
parent to help decide In the light j of
what he thinks best. â¢ However, It may
be well to" call attention to a few, of the
characteristics which It is well for'
them to possess. ? . â¢
They should be Interesting. If they
are not It will be impossible for the
children to find much- pleasure in" them.'
They should be as instructive as it is
possible for the chlldrenof the particu
lar age to enjoy. A great many aocial
games may be selected for the . reason
that they Involve a large amount of In
formation and intellectual training.
and, it is hopedi largely by the parent
Not excepting the influence of the par
ent and teacher, none Is more powerful
for the development of the child than
the influence of his' companions.
Though the parent' and teacher do all
they can to help, in developing high
and noble characters, nearly all they
have accomplished i may be undone by
jone or two companions whose Influence
'has a v blighting effect upon tho develop
ing character of the child.
.Though this Is the case, it is not good
for children "'to be alone/ Such -as are
cannot develop as they should. Neither
Is It well for thern^ to be much with
nurses or those much older than them
selves. This results in unnatural and
injurious precocity. If there are a^
There are many things which a child
can learn much better from children of
about the same age than from adults.
There are Influences -and, impulses
which he feels and develops" only when
In company with those of the same age.
Therefor* , lÂ»t , it ever be remembered
number of children In the family they
should learn to play together: In the
proper spirit. This ia not always easy
as it may seem, but it is important for
many reasons.
The utter folly of depriving a child
of playmates should be apparent , to
most parents. The child Js being pre
pared for life; for companionship with
others. Childhood Is the time for him
to learn to bear and forbear; to sympa
thize with the afflicted: to develop that
loving kindness which will make , him
beloved in after years; to avoid the
wrong and select the right; to develop
habits of self-control and self-denial;
to discover that he Is only one of the
many, and not the only one to be con
sidered. In short, to learn all those
things which will prepare him for
true living. ,
Since this Is so, none but the foolish
parent will strive to keep children
away â¢ from others, j There are many
forms of evil which they should know
nothing of. Yet there are many evils
which all must. know. The important
lesson to be learned is to avoid the
wrong, because it is wrong, and to do
right, because It is right. The child
who learns well thl3 lesson will surely)
develop a noble character. v There Is lit
tle hope for the- one who falls to learn
it. No- wonder that the child \ most
closely guarded quickly succumbs to
all forms of evil temptation when the
time comes for him to leave the secure
home fortress. -. ; ....
Some parents insist that they* should
leave the selection of a boy's or girl's
companions to the boy or girl. When it
is too late they will probably discover
their mistake. Surely, those who fail
to appreciate the importance of doing
all they can In the selection of proper
companions, neglect one of the most
powerful agencies In the training of
their precious children. It Is very much
to be doubted if the Influence resulting:
from such neglect can be counteracted
by anything else the parent may do on
behalf of the child.
Parents, then, shoulc! ever be mindful
of the fact that, next to themselves, the
companions of their children will most
largely mold them. God has given chil
dren such sensitive natures that, uncon
sciously, they are Influenced by all
those with whom they come in contact
They will imitate their playmates' lan
guage, their walk arid their actions.
They will acquire the same tastes; their
minds will run in the same grooves.
They will laugh or cry with them. They
will feel noble, kind, earnest or h3ve
the oposlte feeling with them. We must
not forget that as a mirror they will
reflect the peculiarities, both good and
bad, of those with whom they associate.
one is exerting upon his child. Only In
this' way can any parent properly per
form the duty which devolves upon him
in the training of his child. This can^
not be done, unless the house is open to
these compsnlons. and, unless there Is
a "sympathetic ear for all the child may
have to say consuming those with whom
he la prone to, play. Knowing the char
acteristics of each companion, the par
ent may easily encourage "play with
some and Insist upon the avoidance of
others.

indulgence are the greatest causes of
dyspepsia in women; in reality the
trouble is caused by too much shop

they find themselves utterly worn out.
When this exhaustion occurs, instead
of lying down for an hour's complete
rest before eating anything, they sit
down to a meal more or less hearty,
in order to rest themselves, as they
think. The tired-out stomach is too
weak to care for the load of food that
is thrust upon it.

have added that each religion Is a force

sobriety, for integrity, for unselfishness
and for truth. Indeed there was never
a religion since the beginning of the
world that was not better for the world
As humanity has left behind the cave
dweller, the fisherman in his dugout
canoe ana the warrior who made a
drinking cup of his enemy's skull; as
It has come to the use of wheeled ve

and has called into being slaves with
fingers of steel and lungs of steam; as
It has climbed out of the swamps'up

out of the wayside shadows a gloomy
presence which has croaked to human

for to-morrow you die."

the "million chorded lyre of thought"

thought moves forward from the dark
ness of Ignorance int ffthe light of prog
ress, as surely as the world of matter
rushes onward through space under the
lash "of the centripetal force. Science
has cleared away much. of the rubbish
that ignorance and fanaticism piled
around the altars of Christianity, and
the altars are none the worse for the

Â¦whether the passage of the Red Sea

whether or not tho world ceased to

Accept the doctrine that man Is a

there is an end of moral accountability
and there ought to be an end of ac

preached charity and honesty and love.
The priests of If is and Osiris besought
their followers 'to be merciful as well

Vulcan and Minerva, was a better

Â¦ The Protestant preacher constantly
Impresses upon the members of his
congregation the duties of honesty,
truthfulness, sobriety and obedience to
law. The Catholic priest never ceases
to enjoin upon his flock the necessity
of righteousness of. lire. He says to
the clerk/"Keep your? fingers out of

Every clergyman of whatever denom

It is many years since I had occasion

Materialistic philosophers may sneer
at the errors and conflicts of theology,
but their creed of eternal death Is a
creed that makes criminals. Belief In
God and belief in an after life consti
tute a great reserved vigilant, though
unseen, armed guard, which ever lays
arresting hands upon the selfish and
savage impulses of man. and which
ever aids to keep society in order. No

In saying that "all religions are equally
incredible to the philosopher and equal

saying, to the effect that rt all material

society.'"' Anaxagoras said "the- first

is to be so." Tet unless there Is value
in "being" honest there can be'no value
in "seeming" so. The pseudo scientists
who assert that faith in divine justice
and divine mercy is a folly, that belief
In an after life is a delusion, that there
is no God, and who denounce religion
and propose to elevate "a tawdry and
bedizened Goddess of Reason upon her
desecrated: altars, are engaged in o.JiHa
chievous work. Every advocate of this
false philosophy is a moral lunatic

, One reason why polemical discussion
is usually profitless 13 because it Is thÂ»
spiritual sense of man that perceives
his spiritual life. It is related of Tyn
dall that with a- companion he ones
passed a night on *he summit of the
Alps In order to obtain a 'View there of
sunrise. When the rays of the morn
ing sun lit crystal domes and plnnarets
with prismatic rays. Tyndall's com
panion said to him: "Now, Professor,
don't you feel that there is a God?"
Tea," replied the great materialist, "If
you don't try to prove it- to me."
> Happily the greater part of mankind
are born with the spiritual sense. Oc
casionally there Is a moral malforma
tion who comes into the world without
it. Tou cannot reach such, ' You may
Instruct in many things one who Is bora
blind. Ton may instruct him In math

borne in upon each of us by the testi
mony of his own soul and thought Is a

Discussion between the orthodox and
the unorthodox Is usually profitless, for
on such a subject men will reason in a
circle, and I am not sure that such idle
discussion may not best be terminated
as it was once ended by an old Baptist
divine. There wa3 a conference meet

When a government goes , to the
trouble of bringing up its citizens'
children in a. municipal hospital it
seems too bad that any one should be
dissatisfied, but the benevolent prac

of affairs in Amsterdam.. Holland.
Several . months ago a father sent his
infant son to the hospital to be reared
by incubator. "When he subsequently
visited the institution to see his child
the authorities produced a female
child,- assuring the citizen it was his
own. The sturdy Dutchman at once
invoked the aid of the law and. in
spite. of-. the hospital's defense thac the
citizen brought them a girl, the court
decided that the authorities had pro
duced the wrong o.ne and ordered the
real son to be surrendered. A pro

Much has been written on the sub

and her remarkable record as a pheas

depth and extent of her zoological ac

on natural history, and is a member of
the Zoological Society. The Duchess is

are against school, and the Duke was
educated at home, but afterward
joined the Grenadier Guards. He has
the square face, high forehead * and
blue eyes of his race and rejoices in a

Mrs. Lizzie Myers, was the Santa Claus,
and she was kept busy for an hour dis
tributing gifts to the little ones from
the heavily laden tree, and If once in
awhile she gave a female gift to a male
child it was because the demands upon
her by the impatient children were
greater than she could respond to.
After the little ones had been attended
to there was dancing for the adults for
two hours. Those who attended to the
carrying out of the details of this func
tion were Mary Nunan, Mrs. R. Kemp

dramatic schools have contributed to

"Yes, of course. But it is simply a

doubt if there are any more actors â
that is, in comparison with the In
creased population, than there used
to be in my early days."
"Oh, I think not." Mrs. Whiffen
said, thoughtfully. "There Is always

been nothing like the hardship among
actors for twenty-five years that there
has been this year. Play after play

I interrupted: "Joe Hart ascribes it

"I think he is," Mrs. Whiffen nodded
wisely, "but I hardly think it was the

"And doing quite nicely now," his

"Certainly," Mrs. Whiffen replied,
"but not at the expense of the play.

Just by so much they are a mistake.

to see the higher social regard in
which the profession is held."
"Mr. Whiffen was an actor? I have
heard much 'about him," I ventured
then. '
"Well," Mrs. Whiffen said, with a
sober, little head-shake, "not quite. I
think' audiences are too. much given
to confusing the trappings of the play
with the play. I hear things like this
all the time in New York: One aska
'How did you like the play?' the an

fcult that we prefer millinery to meat
â that's what they give us largely?"
"Yes, the plays Built 'nowadays are
not of the kind that liveâ in the ma
jority of cases," the actress decided.
"And think of the actors. We used
to play everything in "turn. Now, in
the traveling companies, with one of
these light plays as material, you may
have perhaps five lines to say, for per
haps a three years' engagement.. How
can one Improve under such regime?
You are worse at the end of the tour
than you were at the beginning, be
cause it. is humanly impossible to pre
serve your own interest in a part tor
such a length of time. Imagine if you
had to criticize the same play every
night for three years!" -
"Of course, there is a, mechanical
perfection to be obtained in this
wayâ"
"And more njoney to be made," Mrs.
Whiffen quietly supplemented. "I think
the stage was hardly so much of a
money-making business in the old
days. They thought less then of the
reward. It is ' difficult to serve two
masters."
... "You approve of the perfecting of
the trappings?" I reverted then.
"With every reason," Mrs. Whiffen
said. "In the standard plays, Shake
speare, and so^on, they could have
corrected your smallest mistake â and
did frequently," she laughingly, added.
"The pit was a power then. They paid
only their shillings and sixpences, but
they knew the plays just as well as
you, and they would be quite happy in
telling you so. It was ah audience of
critics and. lr you passed muster with
it, things were certainly we'll-, with
you."
"You would hardly say that to
day?" * -, . Â¦ .' "
'Mrs. -Whiffen thought a moment
and then Bald: "Here is where the
big difference comes in, I think. Now,
if you make a small success in a part,
you are immediately designed for a
Btar. and the first thing you know
there is a piece Written 'round you.
In those days we were suposed to
make a success. If we didn't, we next
went 'way back â " no, she won't, I
wagered, breathlessly, as the slang
seemed imminent. And she didn't.
The sentence ended, "went 'way back
to the bottom of the class. We did
whatever we could get to do, thank
fully, and for well-doing the regard
was certain. When the manager found
you could please the audience â the
audience was our great school thenâ
with your, 'The carriage waits, my
lord,' you were trusted a little further.
And so on, and on. Nowadays a pupil
will come from a dramatic- school,
schooled thoroughly in one or V two
parts, and, when expected to play
others, having, ho furtner experience
to fall back upon, fails. And wonders
why."
"There is where your unemployed
army is recruited ?" I suggested.
"Surely. And where the superior
value of the old stock company as a
school is so amply demonstrated.".
"You , spoke of the old . audience as
a school a moment ago?"
And I suppose the gentle, refined
face is not pretty, by traditional rule
and line. It is so much better.
"So I thought it over," she con
tinued, quiet amusement tn her heavy
lidded, clear gray eyes, " and became
an old woman. I played Mercy Kirke
in that first production 486 times in
New York, the longest run of my ex
perience, and have been playing old
women ever since. At any rate, I
started off at a run!" â the dear lady's
tiny joke; "may I end at a walk!"
- "We got quite away from your early
stage days," I suggested then, "the
difference between then and now."
"Yes, and it came about curiously.
Dr. Mallory, who was interested in
the Madison Square Theater, that my
husband opened with 'Hazel Kirke,'
believed that a wife should always
bear her husband's name â he was a
clergyman, you know. I didn't care
very much either way â though, of
course, losing my name was losing a
kind of trademarkâ so I have been
Mrs. Thomas Whiffen ever since. Then
was when I began to play old women
parts, by the way."
; "I've often wondered how it is first
intimated to an actress that she should
put on gray hair," I ventured. '
"I'll tell you how it cams to me."
Mrs. Whiffen promised, smilingly.
"There did not seem to be anything
else open for me at the Madison
Square Theater when we went there.
My husband, of course, wished me to
be in the company and the manage
ment asked what line of work I
wanted. Then my husband came to
me and said: 'My dear, I'm going to
say a funny thing to you. If I were
you I would go in as the old woman.
I know you're not old enough, butâ '
then he said nice things about the old
women I had played and how he
wanted me in the company. Well, I
wasn't a pretty woman, never was â "
Mrs. Whlffen's dimples deepened as I
looked a protest. "Look at my nose!
'What a funny little nose Mrs. Whif
fen's got,' a lady once said, and it was
quite true."
"That was before I was Mrs.Thomas
Whiffen on the bills, though my hus
band and I were married a month
before we left London," she ex
plained. "I was Blanche Galton to
the public then."
"Isn't it rather unusual to change
your stage name?"

Henry W. Savage's English Grand
Opera Company received a stirring
welcome last Monday evening at the
West End Theater, New York, where
a five weeks' season began with the
first English performance of Verdi's
masterpiece, "Otello." in New York.
During the season two operas will be
given every w'eek. each with a com
plete equipment of scenery and cos
tumes. There are thr-ee separate sets
of principals in thi3 organization, to-,
gether with an enormous chorus of
fresh American voices and a large
orchestra that is engaged for the en
tire season. In this way e^ery rendi
tion, no matter where given, is com
plete in all its details.
The United States Circuit Court's
decision that Frank Moulan cannot
act for any other manager than Henry
W. Savage for the next year and a
half has caused consternation among
those actors and actresses who have
no respect for their contracts. Moulan
undertook to "jump" Mr. Savage In
the middle, of his engagement and was
permanently enjoined.
Oza Waldron. the clever little in
genue of the Alcazar Company of last

In explaining his production of the
play in German, Mr. Conried stated
that had secured it from the trans
lator who turned the play from
French into German. "I do not know
whether he had the rights to sell." Mr.
Conried said to a reporter of the New
York Sun. "but I am confident that my
action Is warranted." Notwithstanding
Mr. Conried's statement, the German
production is made without the sanc
tion or authority of Mr. Maeterlinck,
who Is the author and sole owner of
"Monna Vanna." Through no fault of
Mr. Maeterlinck, the American copy
right of "Monna Vanna" Is invalid. Mr.
Fiske, knowing this fact, instead of
seizing the play, desired not only to
have the authorization to produce
"Monna Vanna" from Its author on
principle, but to secure Mr. Maeter
linck's full sanction to the further end
that the drama might be represented
in this country by Mrs. Fiske in full
accordance with the author's ideas.
Thus Mr. Fiske entered into negotia
tions and completed contracts for
"Monna Vanna," the sole moral rights
to which he holds from Mr. Maeterlinck,
to whom he has agreed to pay liberal
royalties. It is believed in this case,
as It happened In the cases of "Cyrano
de Bergerac" and other noted plays, the
copyright of which was lacking or de
fective, that the public will protect the
rights of the author as they are repre
sented by the manager who has re
spected those rights, pays for them and
purposes to interpret the author's work
faithfully.
The English translation of "Monna
Vanna" is now being made for Mr.
Fiske, and it will be a faithful render-
Ing of the work. Orders for the cos
tume designs have been placed abroad,
while the scenes for the production by
Mr. Fiske will be painted in conform
ity with sketches approved by Mr.
Maeterlinck.

That It will be paid goes without say

that the privilege will be worth the

diva's encores, with which she is said
to be not ungenerous, will be in equal
ly satisfying key.

to find her saying, with a small, pa
tient sniff: "You know it is very dif
ficult to get rid of a cold while travel
ing. One arrives at the hotels fre
<jue.ntly in the dead of night, generally
ih a cold room, after riding in
draughty cars all day. Tou are afraid
cf the tired feeling getting over the
footlights, too."
, .1 hastened to assure 'her that every
Â¦one hsd colds just now, and we got
<julte chummy â heavens, what have I
paid? â of course, I mean confidential.
Mr. Printer â on the subject cf reme
dies. Then I wondered just why we
all agree to call this charming gentle
woman "dear old Mrs. Whiffen." Her
hair, under its dainty, motherly bon
net, has only a few gray threads
among its plentiful brown, her face is
etill only gently lined, her trim little
figure what one would call "spry" if
It were not Mrs. Whiff en's. Yet the
name fits. Possibly it is because the
actress has so long been enjoying and
â¢playing. old women's parts, beginning
wi.th the nurse in "Romeo and Juliet"
before she was 20. Perhaps again it
jnay be by. reason of the irresistible
â¢motherliness that beams from her
kind face. Again it may be because,
alas! she is really no longer young,
]hpr even of middle age â though
stfrere's a matter of only a year or so
between her and Bernhardt. And
fancy calling the divine Sarah "dear
/Old Mrs. Bernhardt!" Yet, as she sat
there in her quiet, black gown, quietly
cmart from her frankly elderly bonnet
to her trimly shod toes. Mrs. Whiffen
'might have stepped out of any one of
â¢ the comedies she has graced with her
sweet old ladies, to bow becomingly to
"the affectionate "dear old Mrs. Whif
fen." â¢
We met in the foyer of ihe Colum
bia, Mrs. Whiffen graciously recalling
me â I had met her" with Mary Man
nering last year. She as graciously
acknowledged the introduction of the
artist. We made our way then to the
email, mysterious cavern whence issue
the "ap'ra glasses, two-bits a pair."
and where, if they be friendly, three
'may sit 'round a, tiny green-baize
covered table. Mrs. Whiffen submitted
with gentle cheerfulness to being
placed where the light fell most
Fhrewdly upon her kind face, and we
began on the weather. Not our
breather. Mrs. Whiffen had brought
â¢with her an unmistakable cold, with
Insinuations ' against other weather
than ours as the exciting cause.
â¢"This is the third, my dear, since
>-e left New York, five weeks ago.
And I haven't had a cold for years
â¢before that stayed. I'm afraid," and
the sweet, old face shadowed a little
lipre, "I'm afraid I really must be get
ting old."
. What profession offers a longer
period of well-rewarded usefulness to
TComen than the stage? So it came to
me to wonder last Monday evening.
'when "dear old Mrs. Whiffen" made
h'er pretty bow to the audience that
flapped warm palms to her Â¦welcome,
. in Mr. Fitch's latest effort, "The Girl
Â¦With the Green Eyes." And I won
dered what Mrs. Whiffen would have
to say about it and, being by way of
being able to gratify my wonderings, I
went to see her.

â¢ Miss Amy Gunn's tea in honor of Miss
Elsie Dorr was ajvery smart affair;
The Gunn home is especially well
adapted to the purposes of entertaining,
the living room overlooking the bay
being ideal for such functions.
New Year's day was one of jubilation.
There were teas and receptions galore,
among which were those of Mrs. H.
E. Huntington, In honor of her de
butante daughter, Miss Marian; Miss
Amy Gunri's affair, at which Miss Elsie
Dorr was the- honored guest: Mrs.
George Martin's eggnog party, and
Mrs. , Gertrude Dutton's tea.
The function at. the Huntington home
was the most formal of the day, over
700 invitations having been issued, and
it : would seem, . judging from ' the
streams of callers, that at least 1000 re
sponded.
The drawing-rooms, halls and stair
ways were' graced with fragrant firs,
while between the apartments huge
bells wrought in Christmas berries were
suspended by bands of ruby ribbon.

and their daughter in receiving were

What a week of teas, receptions and
functions of all sorts! Jollity is the
"note of the hour and fun is king.. Long
may he reign. Stupidity has all too
long been monarch. But by that is not
meant that we must resort to the
simian performances of our Gotham
prototypes in order to maintain Jollity.
Let us have sincerity. There and there
only is the true Jollityâ the real Jubila
tion. Let us try to cultivate it, for
in it lies good fellowship. l
Who, alas, was the traitor to the hu
man heart who tried to make one like
unto another? Why wo.uld'he not as
logically try to cultivate the came hair
and features as individualized his fel
low?
Then, how about our "knocking"?
Of course, it is true that a woman of
temperament â and one is a confirmed
criminal without one nowadays â can
rot like, love, or even endure every
Â¦woman whom she chances to meet.
But can she not at least show courtesy
to the innocently offending female?
'Cod never meant, in my humble in
terpretation, that we should "love one
another" as we interpret love, wild and
unreasoning. But we can at least de
eist from canvassing her delinquencies.
Kow; let's try.
The next sin of society is the sin of
ostentation. Now, the true basis of
society is character. Character is. It
Is true, a tremendously broad term, but
â¢we use it now in the sense of mental,
moral and social development. There

hie, Mammon â that I will no longer
Â¦worship at the shrine of gold with its
'alluring glitter. That is. I will 'admit,
a rather rash promise, but remember
our brain cells develop along such lines
as we think, and who knows but
before our "passing," we may begin to
think aright. That rightly interpreted
really is. "doing our duty as we un
derstand* it," but alas! for our frailty,
.for we would fain forget our duty when
"opportunity" lures us aloft.
Then, as a culmination of all our
duties, there comes our attitude to
those we love. Love is in this sense
used in its finest, broadest application,
including the dearest ones Â»ve know â
our husbands, mothers, brothers, sis
ters and our blessed babies. Have we,
as wives, sisters and mothers, fulfilled
the duties and enjoyed the privileges â
(there, there is the "joy of living") â of
our existences? If not let us try.
There, in the secret recesses of our
heartsâ and incidentally of our heads
lies the key to our resolution box. If
we ask aright we shall do aright. But
howaboutthe board bill of the lawyer?
Can he live with three per day under
our Utopian. conditions? Well, let us
try. It will at least lessen the per
plexity of the judges who have to dis
eect the alimony question and the vex
ations of the interlocutory decree.
More strength to good resolutions!
â¢Long may they stand! And falling,
â¢may they have courage to rise again.
â¢ ** 'Tis better to resolve than never
to. have resolved at all." Tour pardon,
saintly poet, to have thus paraphased
thee. but 'tis true. We grow only
through retrospection, and retrospec
tion Is the proper caper at this par
ticular juncture. It Is the proper
caper socially, ethically, financially
and domestically. Aha! How many
tragedies of the coming year may be
averted by the proper resolutions â if
they be kept. But the point is, kept or
not kept, 'tis better that they be made,
for in the making, the tissues of the
brain grow â then, laâ proportion, our
acts improve. There, indeed, lies the
hope of the world. So let's make
resolutions. And since the honored
Gisdpie, St. Paul, tells that "the just
man falls seven times a day," let
those of us who trip up begin again
â¢with renewed vigor. That is what we
might call "moral culture," as opposed
to physical culture.
There are various phases of moral
culture that all of us who constitute
.'"society" in its broad sense might look
into. First and primarily, is our con
duct at the hearthstone. Do we â and
1 am talking to ihe women especially
â realize the strain and struggle that
brings to our itching palms the
shekels we crave for this gew-gaw or
that? Do we know Â¦what shutting off
of the conscience-valves our inordi
nate craving causes? Let us find It
out while yet the year is young. Are
there many among us who would wit
tingly let our men-folk damn their
souls â and incidentally damn their
minds â to satisfy our silly whims?
My women friends, let us think â and
when you think, go "into the silence,"
as the faddists tell us; but, none the
less, it is helpful, even If It be "fad
distic."

FOREIGN MINISTER.
WASHINGTON,' Jan. 2.â It is learned from an official *
source that Japan, in her last note to the Russian Government, an- j
nounced that the minimum proposition which ' she could accept
from -Russia were rights in Korea equal to those claimed by Rus- '
sia in Manchuria. In return, it is said, Japan agreed to recog
nize the supremacy of Russia in Manchuria. '
To this proposition the Russian Government will not give its
â¢ approval, feeling that Japan should content herself with modifica- ';
tions in the form. of concessions in Korea for her commerce. The I
Russian Government has not abandoned hope of a diplomatic ;
settlement of the question, in view of the powerful pressure which'
Great Britain and France are bringing to bear upon Japan to con
sent to a continuance of the negotiations, but it is emphatically
stated that Russia will never admit the parallel between her posi
, tion in Manchuria and that of Japan in Korea.
Count Cassini, the Russian Embassador, believes the Far
; Eastern situation "gloomy, but not without hope of salvation."
At the Japanese legation to-night it was intimated that if the
Russian reply did not give definite assurance that, in general, the
concessions asked for by Japan in Korea would be granted, the
Tokio Government will be impelled to abandon diplomacy for
force. The Japanese Minister does not believe that, after the :
manner in which he claims his people have acted throughout the
negotiations, they will forfeit any sympathy which they have in
this country by striking first.

The excellent horsemanship of Miss
Tobin won universal praise. Her splen
did mount never faltered once at the
high jumps and she was among the
first at the finish. The only others
who reached , the finish were Carolan
and Maurice Raoul-Duval, together
with Huntsman Jerry Keating and the
two whips.
The accidents*- were caused Â¦Â«* by- the
falling of their mounts in both cases
while attempting high Jumps. The
fences lo-day were from four to five
feet In height. The paddock fences at
the Orossways â¢ farm were utilized for
jumps among' others, and it was at the
first of these that Duval's mishap oc
curred. The horse struck the fence win
his fore feet and fell, throwing the
rider heavily to the ground several feet
away, stunned and bleeding. R. Â»L To

injured man, who was conveyed to the
clubhouse and at last accounts was
resting comfortably.
Lawson's hurt was more serious, he
being a man of powerful frame and
great strength. He had made about
fifteen Jumps when, In vaulting over
the last, of the paddock fences, his
horse struck it in a manner similar to
the other animal. Lawson shot over
the animal's head, but had no sooner
struck the ground 'than he made a
quidk move to rise as though uninjured.
As he did so the struggling horse
struck him on the head with a Â¦ hoof
and he fell back unconscious and
bleeding profusely from the wound. He
also was taken to the clubhouse and
cared for. ft was stated this evening
that he had regained consciousness
and no serious results were feared,

After her arrest to-night she stated

On this subject the girl's mind seems

ama this morning because of the re
port that the Colombian warship Gen
eral Plnzon had been sunk by an
American gunboat off the coast of San
Bias. The only details given were that
the Pinzon was in Panama waters when
she was hailed by the American vessel.
The Pinzon, it is said, fired the first
shot, and was then quickly blown to
pieces. The first rumors did not men
tion the name of the American war
ship, but later stories supplied the
name of the Castine, alleging thlit the
latter was on her way back to Colon,
carrying the survivors of the General
Pinzon.
A thorough investigation failed to re
veal an authentic origin for the strange
gossip. Naval officers, who were the
last to hear the report, gave it no cre
dence. It was assumed that the ru
mor followed in the natural sequence
the news of the taking from San Bias
by the Pinzon of the Indian chief In
anaqulna. The Castine was sent to
investigate the Inanaqulna affair for the
navy.

Chicago Iroquols Theater when a
shrill cry of "Fire" rang through the

that several policemen were standing
in the lobby at the moment and met
the emergency with strong measures
checked the wild, unreasoning frenzy
of the audience in its desire to escape
from the building by the . main en
trance. Clubs and fists met the rush
the moment it began, the' police and
the employes of the theater breasting
the crowd and literally lifting the
leaders from their feet and forcing
them into seats.
The attack of the police from the
front was as sudden as had been the
false fire alarm and served in a mo
ment to quiet the crowd and avert
what could not have failed to ; have
been a murderous stampede.

TACOMA, Jan. 2.â Northern Pacific
train No. 4, running from Portland to
Tacoma, was signaled this morning one
mile west of Rainier, in Thurston
County, about thirty- miles from Taco
ma, by three men, who were thought by
the train men to be robbers. Investiga
tion proved that they were young men
of the neighborhood returning from a
dance. They, were, it is said, partially
intoxicated, and signaled the train as a
practical Joke.
The train was running at rapid speed
and rounding a curve, and the engineer
did not bring it to a stop until he had
run 300 yards past the place where the
men were standing. Several of the train
men ran back, and as they neared the
supposed robbers the latter mounted
their horses and rode away.

Drops Dead While Dressins.
SAN DIEGO,- Jan. 2.â Rupert Rei

act of dressing. He -was about 45
years of age. Death probably was
due to heart disease.
GLOBE, Ariz., Jan. 2.â A posse con
sisting of Under Sheriff Pollurd Pear
son and Deputies J. C. Chilson and Ben
Picatt. with Zack and John Booth in
custody, arrived from Pay&on at 6
o'clock this evening, covering the hun
dred miles since yesterday morning.
There was some apprehension that the
relatives "of the prisoners might attempt
a' rescue, but no unusual Incident oc
curred during the journey.
At the Coroner's inquest Zack Booth
admitted killing Wiley Berry and the
Mexican boy, Vigil, and exonerated his
brother. John .Booth. The stcry was
reiterated at the preliminary hearing
before Justice J. p. Hill at Payson, who
bound Zack Booth over 'without bail by
order of District Attorney George R.
Hill. *
The examination of John Booth was
deferred until the bodies of the victims
could be exhumed and careful examina
tion of wounds made to determine if
Berrv and Vigil were shot by bullets
of the same caliber. This r had an im
portant bearing as the Booths carried
guns of different caliber, shooting bul
lets not alike. The conclusion arrived
at after' re-examination .of the bodies
was that they had been shot from one
weapon. Nevertheless John Booth was
present at the killing and accessory to
it and he was also held without bail
for the Grand Jury.
Wiley Berry is the son of W. W.
Berry of St. Johns, a large sheeo owner
and former Sheriff of Apache County.
Youne Berry was shot . twice in the
breast, and the body was left lying In
the camp fire where it had fallen. Vigil,
the Mexican, was shot in the back as
he was running and the assassin then
shot him twice in the body and once
in the neck. '
-The feeling in northern GHa County
is bitter against the. Booths., who are
not cattlemen but: own goats. .Cattle
men especially are incensÂ«"l at the
Booth's,, as statements have been made
alleging that hostility of cattlemen
toward . sheepmen , for invading the
range was back of the killing.- This -is
erroneous, . as cattlemen are peaceful
and" anxious to avoid trouble. The
Booth brothers will be, held in the
County Jail here until the district court
meets next June.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 2.â Warden
Archibald Yell to-day restored to his
position as turnkey at the Folsom pris
on George E. Lamphrey, and thus ends
one of the most interesting episodes
connected with the management of the
penitentiary. By the late Warden
Charles Aull, Lamphrey was regarded
as a valuable officer of the prison. He
retained his place when upon the death
of Aull Warden Thomas Wilkinson as
sumed charge, but it was not long be
fore he earned the. enmity of George
Raymond, a convict. â.};â¢;'
â¢ Raymond, it Is declared, sent word
to Warden Wilkinson that Lamphrey
had designs on the superintendency of
the.prison. Wilkinson dropped Lamph
rey from the roll of. employes. Great
influence was brought to bear upon him
to restore Lamphrey, but the warden
would not be shaken in his determina
tion.
Wilkinson now has been retired, Ray
mond is a simple convict again and
Lamphrey has been given a position of
even greater Importance than that from
which he was dismissed when Wilkin
son assumed charge.
In order to make a place for Lamph
rey, H. J. Kipp has been dismissed as
lieutenant of the guard and P.J. Coch
rane. turnkey, has been "appointeri in
his place, leaving the latter* s place open
for Lamphrey.

LINCOLN, Neb., Jan. 2.â In an in

Democrats ask all the faithful to a ban
quet January 18. After telling of the
honors conferred on Mr. Bryan abroad,
the call declares: -\Â»r .
"Loyal Democrats therefore deem it
only fit and proper that this splendid
American citizen and great Democrat
be honored by his fellow Democrats
upon his return home, and to that end
are arranging a 'dollar dinner' to be
held at the Lindell Hotel, Lincoln, on
January 18. 1904. - *.
"It is to be a Democratic banquet in
fact as well as in name, given by Dem
ocrats who not only refuse to apolo
gize for remaining true to the princi
ples of Democracy as enunciated In the
Chicago and Kansas City platforms, but
deny with emphasis that they owe an
apology to Democrats who deserted the
party during those campaigns and lent
their aid and comfort to the enemy.
While standing ready at all times to
welcome the wandering and erring. ones
back to the Democratic fold, upon suffi
cient, evidence that In the future they
purpose supporting the Democratic
ticket, the Democrats who are arrang
ing for this banquet to Democracy's
gallant leader decline to step aside to
make room at the family table for
those who betrayed the household of
the faithful. While it is true that the
departing tribes of Israel marched
forth with the gaudiest banners and
the loudest sounds of timbrel and lyre,
it is equally true that the ark of the
covenant remained with the tribe â¢ of
Judah. The ark of Democratic cove
nant remains in the household of the
faithful and they are "cordially invited
to gather on the evening of January 18,
to again renew their faith in Demo
cratic principles and gain strength for
the forthcoming struggle for control of
this republic's affairs.
"L. D. WORRALL,
"Chairman Banquet Committee."
Acting Commissioner Clements, who
is head of the commission in the ab
sence of Chairman Knapp, who is in
New York, said he did not regard the
situation as startling, and that he did
not believe any wrongful conduct would
be found, but that it was the unani
mous opinion of the commission that
the rumors should be inquired into by
experts to ascertain the exact facts.
WASHINGTON, JW 2.â Treasury
Department experts to-day instituted
an investigation of the accounts of the
Interstate Commerce Commission. The
action is taken at the instance of Act
ing Chairman Clements of the commis
sion, as, a result of persistent rumors
of Irregularities In the drawing of
vouchers, etc. When the expert ac
countants, Nathaniel L. Ambrose and
Richard H. Taylor, and James Lti
Chase, the latter of the office of the
auditor for the State .and other depart
ments, reached the commission to-day,
they sealed the safe and examined Sec
retary Edward A. Mosley, H. S. Mil
stead, the cashier, and other employes.
Milstead has not been suspended.
Acting Commissioner Clements stated
to-day that he did not know that any
thing was wrong, but that the rumors
had become so persistent that they
could no longer be ignored and the
Treasury Department therefore was
asked to take charge of accounts.
Moseley is under $25,000 bonds as dis
bursing officer.
It Is understood that the rumors in
clude allegations of payments made for
service at one place while the payee was
engaged elsewhere, with similar irregu
lar methods. The investigation will be
thorough and every phase of the ac
countins work of the commission will
be overhauled.
The commission handles about $127.
000 annually, the bulk of It being for
salaries, traveling expenses, etc. The
payments are by warrants drawn on
the treasury. H. S. Milstead performs
the duties of cashier, but Edward A.
Moseley, the secretary of the commis
sion, is in charge of all the accounting
work.

Simply select the book you need.
It is my experience as a specialist of thirty years. In the book I tell how at
last I found a. way to reach difficult, deep-seated diseases. Thirty years of earn-
est, .ardent toil in hospitals and at 'bedsides made it possible for me to write
these books. >;V* :
The books tell how I perfected my prescription^ â Dr. Shoop's Restorative.
How by scientific experiment I traced out the causes that bring on chronic dis-
eases.
I found invariably that where there was a weakness the . inside nerves were
weak. Where there Was a lack of vitality the vital nerves lacked power. Where
weak organs were found. I always found weak nerves. Not the nerves common-
ly thought of, but the vital organs' nerves. The inside â the invisible nerves.
This was a revelation. Then my real success began. ' Then I combined In-
gredients that would strengthen, that would vitalize, these nerves.
That prescription I called 'a restorative. It is known the world over now as
Dr. Shoop's Restorative. After that I did not fall to cure, one case in each hun-
dred. In the extremely difficult cases, my failures for five years were one in
each forty treated. I found cancer incurable. Cancer is for surgery, not medi-
cine. ?
Then how to get this prescription to the sick ones everywhere ~- was my
thought. I must announce it in the public press. But, thought I, will they
realize the real truth of my discovery, the real power of Dr. Shoop's Restora-
tive? Then a way came to me â like an inspiration. "I will offer it to the sick
on trial. Then they will know I am sincereâ that my prescription is unusual."
I wrote a reliable druggist In each city and village in America, They agreed to
co-operate with me. Now by any sick one'

LONDON, Jan. 2.â The fight for ths
possession of the original manuscript
of -Milton's "Paradise Lost" is be
coming quite an international question.
A report that an American Is prepared
to offer S250.000 for it has created
something akin to alarm. Many are
the indignant correspondents who
â¢write to the * papers in alarm at the
nation allowing the manuscript to go
to America. It is suggested that, fail
ing in everything else, a national sub
scription of sixpences be raised' to re
tain this interesting relic in the old
country and make it the property of
the nation, beyond the reach of for
eign" curio hunters. . â¢

was shot in the left arm and three
others received wounds. The first man
shot was taken to Belt Wednesday and
yesterday arrived in this city and is
now being looked for by the police;
the other three men wounded are sup
posed to be in hiding and Sheriff.Ben
ner and a couple of deputies are close
on their trail.
Ball for Reeves has not been fixed
and he will be held in the county Jail
until Monday, when he will be taken
to Belt for a preliminary hearing. The
only remark made by him when ar
rested was to the effect that Gould had
managed to gather in both his wife
and his farm. and he now desired to
make the Job complete. ;
It is alleged that Reeves took excep
tion to the marriage of Gould with his
former wife and that a number of the
neighbors were asked to Join a white
capping party for the purpose of tar
and feathering Gould. Some of those
approached told Gould of the proposed
outrage, Wednesday night last being
fixed as the time. That night Gould
took a Winchester and a box of cart
ridges and stationed himself in a pile
of logs in front of his. home to await
the coming.
Shortly, after 12 o'clock a crowd of
about twenty-five whitecappers ap
peared and approached the house, and
when hailed by Gould ordered him to
come out or be killed. Gould replied
by emptying his gun into the crowd,
tilling it and emptying It again, firing
thirty-two shots in all.
I The uhitecapperB were all masked
and apparently armed, but evidently
did not expect the shooting, as they
fled in all directions without shooting
back. .In tne first shooting one man
divorce in this town a couple of weeks
ago on a cruelty charge. George
Gould. : a prosperous young farmer,
owned the adjoining farm to Reeves,
and when the wife of the latter se
cured a divorce Gould at once secured
a marriage license and ten days ago
the* couple were wed in Benton.
â¢â¢ A warrant was secured from Police
Judge Cabaniss yesterday for the ar
rest of Patrick Quinn.a saloonkeeper
at Twelfth and Folaom streets, on a
charge of threats to kill. The com
plaining witness is his wife, Ellen
Quinn, who alleges that on 'New
Tear's eve he grabbed her by the
throat and choked her, at the same
time saying he would kill her yet.

PARIS, Jan. 2.â The total value of
exhibits at the automobile show is
estimated at 20,000,000 francs. - This
does, not include the sum represented
in the outlay for decorations, illumina
tions and advertising. Nor is the mat
ter of great account compared with
the money brought to hotels and other
enterprises in Paris by the visitor!.
Of the 20.000.000 francs fully 50 per
cent represents skilled labor, so it may
be said that the articles at the auto
mobile show indicate that 10,000,000
francs has been paid in wages and sal
aries.

NEW'YORK. Jan. 2. â The Finan
cier says: The notable features of. the
official, statement of the New York
Associated Banks last week waa, as
was the case in the previous week, an
important increase in .loans. The
gain in this week was $16,307,700,
against $13,522,500 in the week ending
December 26, 1903, making the total
increase for the fortnight $29,830,300.
This expansion was doubtless largely
due to loans upon corporation account
and such operations may be expected
to continue in the near future. Most
likely the increase In loans to some
extent represented temporary lending
by the banks of the funds deposited by
railroad and other concerns prepar
atory to the disbursement of January
interest and dividends. The cash re
serve of the banks was increased $2,
032 300 net. specie being decreased
$475,000. while legal tenders were
augmented $2,608,300. This net gain
in cash was less by $1,334,300 than
that which was estimated from the
traceable movements of money during
the week. The discrepancy can, how
ever, easily be accounted for by. the
fact that the bank statement included
Thursday's movements, which were
-not embraced in the estimate*. The
deposits increased $20,260,200, which
is greater by $1,920,200 than the sum
of the Increase in the loans and of the
net *ain in cash; the statement is
therefore technically oat of proof. The
reserve requirements were $5,065,050,
and deducting therefrom the net grain
in cash, leaves $3,032,750 and the de
crease in surplus reserves to $9,540.
8*5. computed upon the basis of de
posits less those of $36,767,300 pub
lic funds, the surplus is $18.73S.725.
Circulation decreased $379,000 and the
excess of loans over the deooslts was
$22,391,600. against $16,344,100 in the
previous week. The average daily
clearings t or five days was $228,000,
: 000, or $27,000,000 greater than in thÂ«
previous week. >

When the> inquest is resumed Monday
employes of the Montana Ore Purchas
ing *Company will be questioned as to
their. side of the alleged underground
dynamite battle. All the evidence ad
duced at to-day's hearing would seem
to place the blame entirely on the men
employed by the Rarus Company.
H. V. Winchell, head geologist for
the Amalgamated Copper Company, to
day testified that he had discovered
vast amounts of hay in the "raise" just
above the place where the Amalga
mated miners were working, and this,
he declared/was burned, the stifling
smoke being forced in on the Amalga
mated men to prevent them from, car
rying out the orders of the United
States court in making an examina
tion of the Michael Davitt mine to de
termine how much ore hAS-been ille
gally extracted from . the mine. )
At one stage of the proceedings Coun
ty Attorney Peter Breen and L. O.
Evans, attorney for the Helnze inter
ests, engaged in a dispute which threat
ened to develop into a free fight.
According to the testimony of Super
intendent Adams of the Boston and
Montana Company and Foreman Moul
trop of the Pennsylvania mine, on the
day of the explosion the carpenters
built a heavy door to prevent /access to
tne Pennsylvania from the Rarus, and
the two men who were killed were fin
ishing the Job by calking up the cracks
in and. around this door to keep out
the smoke.
Miners who worked with Dievel and
Oleson testified that from the time the
first hole was j blasted into . the old
workings of the Michael Davitt mine
they were continually obstructed by
men from above, .who threw rocks and
other heavy material down the hole,
besides setting off powder and blank
fuses to scare them from their work.
Many times, they testified, they were
compelled to leave their work on ac
count of the smoke sent down from
above, which blinded and choked them.

ining fourteen witnesses this afternoon
Coroner Egan continued until Monday
the inquest over the .bodies of Samuel

Wunderlich, a sister-in-law of Mrs.
Fred - F. Connor, wife of the City
Trustee; her 10-year-old child, Helen
Wunderlich, .and her father, Harry
Danner, were among the victims of
the Chicago disaster. Mrs. Connor
received word yesterday from her
brother, Harry Wunderlich, that he
had recovered the bodies of his wife
and child and father-in-law from the
wreck. This was the first information
Mrs. Connor had received of the fate
of her relatives, as their names did
not appear among the list of dead in
her paper*
The Wunderlichs were residents of
Chicago, where Mr. Wunderlich is
connected with a large piano concern,
and Mr. Danner was visiting them
during the holidays, having come from
his home in Burlington. None of
them had ever been hr California, but
intended to visit it next summer-
MOURNING IN BERKELEY.
Taking with them lanterns, the offi
cers went to the building and explained
their mission to Dr. William E. Har
per, secretary of the dental school. Dr.
Harper assured them that he had
searched the entire building to make
sure that no bodies or lost property re
mained, but to satisfy the police he
personally conducted them from attic
to cellar, opening doors to dark and
long passages and making the search
a thorough one. The only bodies found
were those in the dissecting-room,
which the police carefully examined
and decided that they were not those
of victims of the flre.
CHICAGO, Jan. 2.â Assistant Chief of
Police Schuettler received word late
this afternoon that the bodies of sev
eral victims of the Iroquois Theater flre
which had been carried into the North
western University building had been
taken by students and secreted. The
fact that many persons have been re
ported missing whose bodies have not
been found by friends after a most
careful search through the morgues

mentioned as a possible cause of the
curtain's failure to reach the stage, was
proved to have been out of the way of
the curtain as It descended.
On either side of the proscenium arch
In the theater was a metallic reflector,
concave In form, twenty feet long and
studded throughout its entire length
with incandescent lamps. Normally
these lights littad into niches in the
masonry, but when In use they were
swung out. In order that the lights
might be thrown upon the performers
on the stage. Their greatest width,
when open, was fourteen Inches. When
both reflectors were in place the fire
curtain had no impediment In Its
course, but with either swung outward
the descending curtain could not get
below the reflector'3 top. Carelessness
of some employe, whose identity it will
be the effort of the police to ascertain
to-morrow, resulted In the combination
of the open reflector and falling curtain
After issuing his sweeping order,
Mayor Harrison said:
"I do not wish to assume responsi
bility for these theaters. The order
was issued to make it certain that no
precaution to insure the safety of au
diences had been neglected.
"It is quite probable that the owners
of the theaters will sustain serious
financial loss; but, in view of the condi
tion of the playhouses, we cannot take*
any risk, and if the law had been fully
complied with in the first place there
would have been no question of clos
ing them now. The Auditorium, which*
is the only theater left open in Chi
cago, has a steel roll curtain, and as
this seems to be the only curtain that
affords absolute protection against fire,
I have determined as far as possible
to see that the other playhouses are
similarly provided."
PROPRIETORS ARE ARRESTED.
Will J. Davis and Harry Powers,
proprietors of the Iroquois Theater,
and Building Commissioner Williams
are under arrest, charged with man
slaughter. They have been released
on J 10,000 bonds and their hearing ia
set for January 12. The warrants for
their arrest were sworn out by Arthur
E. Hull, who lost his wife and three
children in the fire. Hull explained
that his action was not inspired by
any- motive of vengeance, but simply
to make it certain that the owners of
the theater should not escape any
chance of punishment that was right
fully theirs while stage employes and
electricians were compelled to suffer.
It Is a noteworthy fact that Build
ing Commissioner Williams, who is
now charged with manslaughter in
connection with the greatest fire hor
ror the country has ever experienced,
owes his appointment to a tragedy of
a similar nature, but of much less ex
tent, which occurred two years ago.
Williams' predecessor vacated his of
fice after the burning of St. Luke's
Sanitarium at Twentieth street and
Wabash avenue. This was the insti
tution in which a score of men suf
fering from delirium tremens were
burned to death while strapped to
their beds. Williams was selected in
the belief that he was the proper man
to see that no such catastrophe could
again occur.
FINDS CAUSE OF HOLOCAUST.
Fire Inspector Fulkerson to-night
announced that he had finally dis
covered the secret of the flre. The as
bestos curtain, upon which the safety
of the audience depended, was, ac
cording to Fulkerson, blocked in its
descent by a reflector carelessly left
open by a stage employe. While one
end of the curtain got within five feet
of the stage the other was suspended
twenty feet above it and beneath It
swept the flood of Game that carried
death to so many hundreds.
The first step toward a definite con
clusion as to the cause of the flre was
made when William McMullen, opera
tor of the "spot" light, threw the blame
upon another electric light near i by.
The task was. completed when Fulker
son followed up a clew given by John
A. Mazzoni, a stage employe, and dis
covered the deadly reflector, still open,
in the ruins of the theater.
The wire used in thÂ© "aerial ballet,"
MUST OBEY THE LAW.
_ The seventeen places of amusement
which were shut last night were closed
for the one reason that they were not
provided with an asbestos curtain. The
further action taken to-day is in con
sequence of violations of other sections
of the ordinances regulating theaters.
There was a rush of theater managers
to the office of Mayor Harrison in the
effort to obtain the withdrawal, or, at
least, a postponement of the order, but
their reception was of an exceedingly
frosty nature. They were informed by
the irayor that the inspectors had re
ported . in the case of every one of
them which had violated the law and
he determined that It should not be
said hereafter that the city had neg
lected anything which could prevent
a repetition of the horror of last
"Wednesday.
The fact that the asbestos curtain in
the Iroquois Theater was so badly
wrecked by the fire that charred por
tions of it have been carried away by
the various investigating committees
caused thf committee to decide that
asbestos curtains could not be relied
upon to afford the most complete pro
tection. It was announced that every
theater in the city must hereafter
comply with the following provisions
before they will be allowed to open:
Steel roll curtains, wide exits, no com
bustibles of any kind in the house fur-
nishlngs, fireproof ed scenery, no cal
cium or "spot" lights to be used on
the stage; skylights above the stage
provided with automatic lids to permit
the egress of smoke, flre and gas;
separate stairwaysâ each exit having
Its own stairs leading to the Btreet.
The order compelling the theaters to
close was issued this afternoon by
Mayor Harrison after a conference
with Corporation Counsel Tolman, who
assured the Mayor that ample legal
ground existed for his action.
Seventeen theaters and museums
were closed last night and the sweep
ing order of the Mayor to-day shut the
doors of sixteen more. The latter are
the leading theaters in the business sec
tion'of the city, namely:
The Studebaker, Grand Opera-house.
McVicker's, La Salle, Garrick, Illinois,
Powers, Bush Temple, Calumet, Cleve
land, Great Northern, Haymarket. Hop
kins, Peoples 1 Institute, Trocadero
and Columbus. The Illinois and Pow
ers are owned and controlled by Pow
ers and Davis, the managers of the ill
fated Iroquois. The Garrick Theater
closed to-day ls~not to be confounded
with the Garrick closed yesterday, It
being one of the largest playhouses
in the city, while the one concerning
which action was taken yesterday is
a much smaller house in the northwest
ern portion of the city.
MANAGERS BESIEGE MAYOR. .
CHICAGO, Jan. 2.â Every, theater in
the city of Chicago was in darkness to
night, its doors locked. Not one of
them will be open to the. public until
their managers -shall have complied in
the fullest manner with every / section
of the ordinances regulating play
houses.
Cause of Failure to
Lower Certain Is
Discovered.
CHICAGO, Jan. 2.-The
total number of dead
in the Iroquois The
ater flre has been definite
ly .established at 587i.of
which but twelve remain
unidentified. To one man's
carelessness, it was to
day learned, can the enor
mous loss of life be attrib
uted. It was found,
through information sup
plied by a stage employe,
Â¦that the lowering; of the
asbestos curtain was pre
vented by a projecting re
flector, which caught one
end of the curtain, leav
ing an opening through
which a wave of flame
poured out upon the audi
ence. The man whose
duty it was to swing the
reflector out of the way of
the curtain had failed to
do so, and the holocaust
resulted. Every theater
in Chicago has been closed
by the Mayor's orders
pending the proper observ
ance of the city's regula
tions insuring protection
against flre. Scores of fu
nerals were held in the
stricken city to-day. Be
ginning at the noon
hour every church bell in
Chicago joined in tolling
a dirge of an hour's dura
tion.

CHICAGO'S THEATER HORROR
DUE TO ONE CARELESS MAN
CHICAGO, Jan. 2.â Church bells toll
ing at, noon, business activity checked,
manv celebrations postponed and long
lines of funerals making their way to
the outlying districts, where the ceme
teries are situatedâ these circumstances
to-day evidenced ; Chicago*s outward
grief for the victims of the Iroquois
Theater disaster. Priests and minis
ters of the gospel went from funeral
to funeral'to-day, as they will to-rhor
row and Monday. The unidentified
dead will be kept as long as possible
at the morgues. If no one then comes
to lay claim to the bodies they will be
burled at the city's expense. By com
mon assent of the clergy/ "Lead, Kindly
Light," the hymn written by Cardinal
Newman, is being sung at all the fu
nerals.
The City Hall, except absolutely nec
essary departments, was closed to-day.
The Board of Trade closed an hour
earlier than usual, and a number of
mercantile and manufacturing estab
lishments also closed early.
Â« Thirty-four teachers in the public
schools are known to have lost their
lives in the fire, and the schools will
be closed on Monday in .their memory.
The tollinjj of bells at noon for. an
hour was in response to an expressed
wish of* Mayor Harrison. At 12 o'clock
the chimes of a North' Side church
tolled a dirge and the northeast wind
carried it over the city. "" Before the
first notes had died away another chime
farther south sounded a mournful in
.Jonation. . Then a hundred bells broke
forth in a mighty diapason, whose iron
moans seemed to reach the gray clouds
and echoed b?ck again in solemn con
cord. As the tones, of the city's dirge
in the scattered towers spread over the
city more persons paused and listened
in sorrow and awe than on any occa
sion in the, minds of the people. Many
stood with bared heads, as on the day
of the burial of President McKinley.
Among the hundreds of funerals to
day perhaps none had so many dis
tressing features as those wherein were
burled â¢ three out of four generations
of the family of Benjamin â¢ Moore, a
grocer. There had been a familv re
union in the Moore household, and Ben
jamin Moore was surrounded by his
children, his grandchildren and ; 'his
great-grandchildren. Nine members of
the family went to the Iroquois Theater
to see VMr. Bluebeard."/ Seats were
purchased in the last row of the'sec
ond balcony near the aisle farthest
away . from the main entrance. ' When
the fire and smoke came all but one
of the party sat still and were killed.
The eight bodies were among those in
terred to-day. Â¦â¢ ....-Â¦

PERMITS FOR BURIALS.
"When I reached the bridge I could
see the sparks drifting under the cur
tain toward the audience. When I
looked again a few seconds later a great
sheet of flame was darting under the
curtain and into the faces of the peo
ple. I stuck to the work c-f trying to
fet the curtain down until embers and
pieces of scenery began falling upon me
and burning me, and then I ran across
the stage and into the alley. I stayed
at the door and helped everybody out
until all had escaped who came that
way."
Inspector Fulkerson, taking witnesses
with him, at once went to the theater,
where he found that, although the
flames had whipped the asbestos cur
tain Into shreds, the reflector which
had blocked its descent was still In the
position stated by Mazzoni. .
"I stood near the switchboard from
which the flre started," said Mazzoni,
"when- 1 saw the flames shooting up
from the drapery near the lamps. The
fire curtain . was coming down as I
looked up and.almost at the same time
I saw that one end was lower than the
other, and as I looked close I could
see that it was caught. I ran up on
the bridge on the ncrth side to try to
get the curtain free. The bridge is
twelve feet high and, although I climb-,
ed upon the rail, I could hardly touch
the bottom of the curtain.
which cost approximately 600 lives.
Mazzoni. who was employed as a
scene shifter, was one of the first of
the stage employes to be placed under
arrest. After his release this afternoon
on bonds of $5000 he disclosed the truth
of the misrjlaced reflector to Fire In
spector Fulkerson.

ments and are continually devising means and ways for getting them Into the

Sudden Death of C. O. Perry.
" In the great holocaust which took
place on December 8, 1863, at Santlgo,
in Chile, where 3000 women were
burned to death, one witness of that
awful affair, Colonel Andrews, presides
here in San Francisco.- On that
memorable night he happened to be
passing the church in company with
Harry Melggs. The sacred edifice,
known as the Church of La Compagne,
was crowded to suffocation. It was
the great day of the church, the last
day of the celebration of the festival
known as the Conception of tha Virgin
Mary.
Everybody present was devoutly
kneeling in prayer, when suddenly the
decorations at the back of the altar,
which were illuminated with 20,000
camphorlne lamps, suddenly burst into
flames.
Chaos reigned. The thirty-three
priests who were officiating at the, ser
vice did their utmost to control the*
great throng' of worshipers, but there
was at once a mad rush for. the great
portals of the church. The result was
an awful crush. The doorways were
Jammed by- the seething mass and not
one soul escaped to tell the tale. The
bodies of the unfortunates were buried
on the spot in -which they expired. -For
one year after the catastrophe no pub
lic festivities of any sort were indulged
in by the people of that province.

poleon Princess Mathilde managed his
house and dispensed the honors, retir
ing gracefully to her personal studies
when Louis Napoleon married. During
that epoch she was regarded as one
of the most beautiful women in France,
combining as she did the French type
of beauty with Italian vivacity. Since
the fall of the empire Princess Mathilde
had maintained a salon in Paris which
was frequented by celebrated people of
the art, literary and military worlds
and by diplomatists and foreign
Princes. Until her last illness the
Princess was deeply Interested in pol
itics, and it is said that after Joseph
Reinach's' defense of former Captain
Dreyfus she Bent to Relnach her card
initialed P. P. C. (Pour Prendre Conge),
a punishment she meted out to all who
displeased her.

PARIS. Jan. 2.â Princess Mathllde.
the only daughter of Prince Jerome
Bonaparte, died here at 7 o'clock to
night. Shortly before the Princess ex
pired ex-Empress Eugenie and Princess
Clothile visited the bedside. The death
of Princess Mathilde has caused sorrow
throughout France, not only because
she was one of the last of the Napole
ons, but because' she was always known
as "the good Princess."
Count Felury once told this story of
her: "A little cousin of the Princess
asked her, 'Do you know that through
Queen Catherine you are related to al
most all of -the reigning houses of Eu
rope?' The Princess answered: ' 'Tls
good, 'tis good; but what is that beside
being the niece of Napoleon?' "
Prince Jerome Bonaparte arranged a
marriage between his daughter and
Louis Napoleon, but without success.
While they were in St. Petersburg Em
peror Nicholas conceived a great affec
tion for the Princess and gave her a
decree of divorce when sho was no
longer abla to live with her husband.

He commanded the right wing of the
Army of Northern Virginia at the bat
tle of Gettysburg and tried to dissuade
Lee from ordering the disastrous
charge oa the third day. When Lee
retreated to Virginia, Longstreet. with
five brigades, was transferred to the
Army of Tennessee under Brag-.gr. and
at the battle of Chlckamauea held the
left wing of the Confederate army.
He was then detached to capture
Knoxville, but found it too strongly for
tified to be taken by assault. Early in
1S64 he rejoined Lee and was wounded
by the fire of his own troops in the bat
tle of the Wilderness. He commanded
the First Army Corps of the Army of
Northern Virginia, was in all the oper*
ations in 1864 and was Included In the
surrender at Appomattox, April 9, 1865.
He was known in the army as "Old
Pete" and was considered the hardest
fighter in the Confederate service. He
had the unbounded confidence of his
troops, who were devoted to him, and
the whole army felt better when in the
presence of the enemy if it was passed
along the line that "Old Pete was up."
After the war General Longstreet es
tablished his residence in New Orleans,
where he engaged in commercial busi
ness in the firm of Longstreet, Owens

a brigade on the right of the Confed
erate line, where he kept a large force
of the national army from operating in
support of McDowell's flank attack.
On General Joseph E. Johnston f s re
treat before McClellan at Torktown
Longstreet commanded the rear guard,
having been made a major general.
On May 5, 1862. he made a stand at
\v illiamsbunr. and was at once at
tacked by Heintzelman, Hooker and
Kearny. H e held his ground until hia
opponents were reinforced by Hancock
when he was driven back into his
works. He took part in the seven days 1
battles around Richmond, and at the
second battle of Bull Run. when, in
command of the. First Corps of the
Army of Northern Virginia, came to
the relief of Jackson, when that gen
eral was hard pressed by Pope's army,
and by a determined charge in flank
decided the fortunes of the day. At
Fredericksburg he held the Confeder
ate left. In 1S63 he was detached with
two of his divisions for service south
of the James River. On Hooker's
movement, which led to the battle of
Chancellorsvllle, Longstreet was or
dered to rejoin the army of Lee, but
did not arrive in time to participate in
the battle. ' -
James Lonsrstreet was born in Edge
fleld district, S. C, on January 8, 1821.

The wearer appeared at last in the
person of pretty Miss Rugge-Price, and
a sigh of relief went up when, on the
opening of the carriage door, a little
foot, clad in emerald-green silk, be
came visible.
Reverting to the rhyme, the "some
thing old" was the lovely old English
point on the bride's wedding gown,
which itself carried out the "something
new" by being composed of rich bro
cade velvet, the latest fashionable at
tire for brides.
"Something borrowed" was difficult
to notice, but the "something blue"
might have been seen in the exquisite
nosegay of orchids which she held.
"Something blue." too, was worn by
many of the guests at the church, and

The old rhyme was carried out to the

marriage to Sir Patrick Playfair at* St.
Paul's Knightbridge, recently, will
long be remembered in the annals of
society weddings, as one of the pret
tiest mixtures of old-world superstition
and up-to-date smartness.
"Green stockings for luck," was an
other quaint idea carried out at the
wedding. -According to tradition the
wearer must be one bridesmaid out of
six, and must be older than the bride
herself. It was a small matter to ex
cite so much interest, and yet the
crowd of watchers outside the church
door included many smartly-dressed
women, whose single motive was to
catch a glimpse of the green stockings.

following sales:
SAMPLE DECEMBER SALES.
Emma A. Harrington has sold the
property on the west line of Larkin
street, 27:6 feet south of Turk, to
George G. Burnett for $21,500.
Two transactions of some size were
recorded on Friday last. These were
the sale of the northeast corner of Mc-
Allister and Octavia streets by the es
titte of Isaac Selig to Robert G. Kelson
for $20,000, and the sale by Annie A.
Barton and others to the J. Cuneo
Company of the southwest corner of
Pacific and Stockton streets for $22,600.
Thomas Magee & Sons and Bovee,
Toy & Co. were the brokers who made
the deal by which the southwest cor
ner of Beale and Mission streets, 137 :6x
137:6, was sold for $150,000. The pur
chaser is the W. P. Fuller Company.
If any proof were needed of the solid
ity of Ban Francisco realty as an in
vestment It would be supplied by the
figures of the total transactions In real
ty in this city during the twelve
months that ended December 31, 1903.
The statistics concerning the deals of
the year 1903 were published in The
Call yesterday.
Attention is called to the figures rela
tive to sales and mortgages. The total
sales were $47,710,157. The mortgages
were In total $32,818,821. That shows
that there was an actual investment of
capital by purchasers of at least $15,
000,000 of their own money, and that
the banks and others loaned twice that
amount on the properties that changed
hands. The banks, in other words,
stood back of their belief in the fu.ture
of San Francisco with the readiness to
loan $32,000,000 on it in one year â twice
the sum the buyers invested in cash.
The last week of 1903 closed with few
sales to record. There are deals of
some size that will probably come to a
conclusion during: the present month
and start the new year off handsomely.
The realty brokers are still looking for
ward for a prosperous year in 1504.
Through the agency of G. H. Umbsen
& Co. 45x67:6 feet and improvements
on Bush street, 675 and 677, between
Stockton and Powell streets, has been
sold for $45,000. The lot runs through
to Ankeny plac?. The purchaser is a
client of G. H. Umbsen & Co.
John Roeenfeld's Sons are the pur
chasers of the old Lachman & Jacobi
property, at Second and Bryant streets.
The price paid was approximately $250,
000. The deal went through some time
ago, but the deed has only Just been
recorded.

DENVER, ; Jan. 2. â John j W.
Springer, president of the National
Live Stock' Association, left this city
to-day for Portland, Ore., going by
way of California, to attend the. as
sociation's annual convention v next
week.
"Reports indicate that more-stock
men are going than were ever at a
previous convention," said Mr. Spring
er. "One,of4he principal topics on
the tongues of all who are going Is,
How tot fight the beef trust We cer
talnly.wlll take~up that subject. Then
there are: big questions of politics, of
railroads and the packing interests,
and all of them will come up for vital
consideration."
STOCKMEX PREPARE TO
FIGHT BEEP TRUST
NEW YORK, Jan. 2.â To-day's vio
lent break in prices of stocks was sud
den and unexpected and the grounds
for the heavy liquidation of the day
are not clear even now, although it is
evident that an acute apprehension
of the effects of the coming outbreak
of war between Russia and Japan was
the Impelling cause. The news of the
day was rather more hopeless of the
possibility of avoiding war. but "Wall
street has accepted war as the as
sured outcome of the situation for
some time and has viewed that out
come with apparent equanimity with
out selling to discount a war scare, as
is the invariab*- custom of specula
tive markets in face of a coming
event. The cumulative force of the
alarmed 6elllng movement to-day
therefore gave rise to fears that some
thing was known in the interior cir
cles of great capitalists of ulterior
complications threatening to Involve
other powers in the coming struggle.
ARJIY MAX'S VIEWS.
The published expressions of opin
ion of a general involvement uttered
by an American military authority
and intimations that an outbreak of
war would involve a delicate situation
for all the great powers, including the
United Stages, were seized upon to
feed the prevalent alarm. The effect
upon the market lost nothing In force
from the fact that the considerable
speculative commitments have been
made in expectation of a January de
mand for securities, which may be
checked by the course of events which
is feared. Other considerations seem
ed to be wholly ignored and the bank
statement offered nothing to counter
act the disposition to get out of stocks.
The first of the year Is expected to in
volve large changes in banking items,
but to-day's $16,000,000 loan expan
sion, following that of over $12,000,
000 last week.* is indicative of other
demands than year-end payments
and causes the fear that last win
ter's enormous corporation borrow
ings after January 1 are to be dupli
cated this year. The market closed
active and weak, in spite of spasmod
ic rallies in spots, and losses on the
day range from 1 to 4 points on the
principal stocks.
The advance of the last few weeks
in prices of stocks showed some hesl-
Governor Appoints a Commissioner.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 2. â Governor
Pardee to-day appointed A. S. Lyon
pf Placerrille commissioner of the
Lake Tahoe road, to fill the unexpired
term of J. s. Baker, who died some
time aeo.
Outlook in the Far East
Has a- Depressing: Effect
on General Stock Market
TALK OF WAR
IS DISTURBING
rowing was beginning earlier than us
ual without waiting for the actual re
lease of funds' after. the January dis
bursements. Last year the loan con
traction continued up to the end of the
year, but from December 25, 1902, to
February 21.-1903, the loans of the New
York banks expanded to the extent of
nearly $76,000,000, bringing the total of
that Item to $950,000,000. the high record.
REACTION NOT ACUTE.
While the tightening ofthe money
market has checked the activity and
the advance in the market, the reac
tion has not become acute and the
profit taking by professional operators
has been well taken. The action of
the market has fostered the impres
sion that powerful support has been
at hand .to conserve the purposes of
the advance. The opinion is general
that an important element of these
purposes lg to Improve the showing in
investments held by great financial
corporations in yearly balance sheets
to stimulate the market for taking
new bond offerings to better advan
tage, and also to some extent to make
a higher level of prices on which to
meet the demand of the general out
side public, which is hoped for with
the January relaxation of the money
markets. The freedom from any pres
sure upon the market in face of the
tation this week and came to a halt
when admonished by the stiffening of
the rate for call loans, which gave
warning of the need impending for the
use of funds recently accumulated In
banking reserves. These funds have
been placed on call pending the demand
for their employment in paying off the
year end obligations for which they
were accumulated. The amount of the
dividends and interest to be paid in
January are variously estimated at
from 5130,000.000 to J150.000.000. By skill
ful management it is possible to ar
range for the transfer of the greatest
part of this by bookkeepinsr accounts
and by not disturbing the aggregate
bank deposits. But the'banks are ac
customed to take account of the pos
sibility of the simultaneous presenta
tion of the checks sent out for this year
end payments and to arrange their re
serves accordingly. The further en
gagements of gold in Lâidon for im
port this week have been viewed there
fore with satisfaction and have been
a material factor in moderating the in
fluence of the higher money rate. The
course of the loan item of the banks
in the next few weeks is another factor
to be keenly watched. Large railroad
bond issues are known to be impending
and last week's heavy loan expansion
gave warning that the corporation bor-
advance has been an encouraging fac
tqr in itself and sentiment over the
business outlook has grown less pessi
mistic.
' STEEL OUTLOOK.
This is notably true regarding the
iron and steel outlook. Reports froin
railroad traffic officials of a pressure of
business sufficient to threaten car
shortage in some directions were not
without effect upon sentiment. The
wild speculation in the cotton market
has been a disturbing factor rather
than otherwise, but this has been re
stricted.
Factors in the background which
have not lost heir force are the unset
tling: influences of a national political
campaign, the decision in the North
ern Securities case to come and the
shaping of consumptive demand for
products during 1 the coming year.
The bond market has reflected only
a light investment demand and prices
have moved Irregularly.
United States new fours, registered,
have declined Y<, the threes 1% and
the old fours 2 per' cent on the call
durins the week.
The body was placed in the crpyt of
the church. The cadets at the "West
Point Military Academy, of which
Father Deshon was a graduate and
classmate of General. Grant, sent A
wreath of immortelles.
SAYS MOUMOX CHURCH
IS NOT AGAJXST LABOR
Proidrncy Makes Emphatic Denial
That Influence lias Been Used
Against Unions.
SALT LAKE, Jan. 2. â The first
presidency of the Mormon church to-
Oay sent a telegram to President
Gompers of the American Federation
of Labor denying the charge that the
church had taken a stand ag'ainst or
ganized labor. The message, which is
signed by President Joseph H. Smith
'and his advisers in the first presi
dency. John R. Winder and Anton H.
Lund, is as follows:
' "A report having been circulated
that the Mormon church has used its
influence against organized labor and
has endeavored to fill the places of
â¢union strikers with non-union men.
â¢we hereby emphatically deny that the
church over which we preside has
Â¦taken any such step or issued any in
structions on this matter. The whole
'story originated in a false newspaper
report."
The charges referred to arose from
the reading at the regular tabernacle
services last Sunday of a notice by
President George Q. Cannon of the
Salt Lake Stake that men were want
ed In the Utah coal mines to fill the
places of strikers. President Cannon
Bays the notice was handed him by a
coal company official and read with
other notices, as is the custom. No
Question of church Influence, he says,
was directly or indirectly connected
with the reading of the notice.
Much interest ls being manifested in
the coming: series of lectures by Burton
Holmes, the renowned traveler and
speaker. The sale of reserved seats
will open this morning at the music
store of Sherman, Clay & Co. The first
of the rerics is to be given on Tuesday
rvening. January 12, at Lyric Hall, on
Eddy street.
The Holmes talks have alwavs been
popular with the people of this city
and have always received favorable
criticism, not only here, but all over
the United States. Mr. Holmes has a
fascinating way of addressing an au
dience, and he never fails to hold the
attention of his listeners.
The firsj. lecture will be on the Yo-
Femite Valley. This. beautiful spot of
nature has always been a favorite with
â¢Mr. Hclmes. During the course of his
Ueture? Mr. Holmes will also speak
on the Klondike, and devote his efforts
to describing places of interest of Eu
rope and the Orient. The lectures vill
be illustrated by hundreds of beautiful
Ftereopticon viewp.

Honor to Yale.
Governor Taf t's departure from the
Philippines, terminating his Governor
ship over those islands, ends a coinci
dence unique in the annals of Yale uni
versity, and very unlikely ever to be
repeated In that or any other American
educational institution.
The coincidence Is that for the last
month or. more Tale, represented by
her sons, has held at one and the same
time the Governorships of the three
so-called colonial territories of the
United States and also that of Alaska.
With the Incumbency of Governor
Taft Yale has governed at Manila; with
that'of Governor Hunt, in Porto Rico;
with that of Governor Garter, in Ha
waii, and with that of Governor Brady,
in Alaska. Governors Taft, Hunt, Car
ter and Brady are all Yale alumni. Al

which Yale can point to with pride â

Science has given the human" race,
only a limited span of existence. This
was one of the prospects which dis

many other sensitive minds. Some

the .-average estimate. The discovery
of radium naturally led to the ques-
SUPPRESSING ECHOESâ C. B.,
City. An echo audience rdtom is a sub
ject for a scientific architect. If a
room is without gallery it Is quite like
ly that the addition of such would
greatly improve it as an audience room.
Well padded carpets, cushions, prop
erly hung chandeliers and the like help
to destroy the echoes. A large canopy
a few feet above the head of the place
to be occupied by the speaker. It Is said,
will make a marked change for the bet
ter.
ATTENTION was directed by The Call, some time
since, to the work of improvement in towns and
cities of the Sacramento Valley to which the
women's clubs of Sacramento and other communities
have pledged their support. It is now to be noted that
equally good work is being done by the women of other
localities.
In San Mateo County the tendency in the counsels
of the women is toward civic betterment. There is an
Auxiliary Civic Club at San Mateo and the San Mateo
Times tells of this club's work. It has recently raised
$100 for a library improvement fund, another $100 to as
sist in the purchase of a chemical engine, and also has
contributed toward the promotion of the athletic club
Committees have been appointed by Mrs. A. B. Ford, the
president of the Women's Auxiliary Club, to attend to
the betterment of the library, the providing of greater
protection against fire and to the promotion of the
prosperity of the club. There is no doubt" the commit
tees will zealously attend to the work set before them.
The; Los .Angeles Herald reviews the work of the
women's clubs of Los Angeles during the past year.. It
will be observed that the California women in the south
are active in adding to the welfare of the State. They
have marked the site of old Fort Moore with a flagstaff
to call attention to the historic interest of that place.
Arbor day.: has engaged their attention and work was
planned by the women, to 'promote outdoor art and park
improvement. The establishment of a home of detention
in Connection with the juvenile court work has been
considered. They have waged war against the smoking
of cigarettes by boys and have taken part in the college
settlement work in destitute localities.
Two. thousand women are banded together in clubs in
Los Angeles, and several other: communities, in propor
tion to their population)' r- ' an equally good showing.
In short, there are scorej of clubs organized by Cali
fornia women, that are fulfilling their mission of improve
ment well and worthily and deserve fullcredit for their
work. ' . V " .
WOMEN'S CLUBS' WORK.
WASHINGTON-G. J. R, City.
George Washington was known by
other nicknames than "Father of His
Country." He was called the Ameri
can Fabius in allusion to the fact that
he pursued a cautious policy; the
Atlas of America, the Cincinnatus of
the West (a name given him by
Byron); the Deliverer of America; the
Stepfather of his Country; the Flower
of the Forest (a name given him by
the Indians), and Lovely Georglus (a
name given him by the British soldiers
engaged in war).
That very general longing to make a martyr of any
one who has to suffer for the sake of a newly enunciated
principle has led a part of the Eastern press to rally
to the support of this anarchist from England and attack
the law which has detained him. They say that this law
is a tyrannical infringement of the rights of man; that
it gives into the keeping of an arbitrary committee of
officials the life happiness of any innocent individual;
that it is little better than the famous "lettres de cachet"
of the old regime v in France. How, say they, are the
officials to determine upon the heterodoxy of belief in
a thousand and one unwashed immigrants? Where are
they to draw the line between anarchy and mere lack
THE arrest and pending deportation of John
Turner, a noted English anarchist, under the oper
ation of the Congressional act of March 3, 1903,
decreeing deportation for all immigrants of known
anarchistic beliefs, has brought the legality of the meas
ure before the courts. Turner has appealed to the Fed
eral tribunal in New York and the decision upon his
case is still pending. Should an adverse decision be
rendered by Circuit Judge Lacombc the Supreme Court,
according to the assertions of the prisoner's counsel,
will be called upon to decide whether or not the law of
Congress is contrary to the spirit of the United States
constitution.
The enactment of Congress under which Turner was
arrested provides that no person who disbelieves in or
ganized government or who is affiliated with any group
of individuals or society which holds to the tenets of
radical anarchy shall be permitted an abiding place in
the United States. ' A board of three immigration, offi
cers passes upon the merits of every case, and
their opinion gains finality by the indorsement of the
Secretary of Commerce. This measure is the direct re
sult of the assassination of the late President McKinley,
the many anarchistic disturbances at Paterson, New
Tersey. and the general feeling of disquietude which has
been engendered during two years past by the growing
boldness -of all members of that fanatical sect in this
country.
The High Priest of Odin, clothed in
white, next stepped forth, and while
electric lights formed -a dazzling nim
bus round him' more music was sung.
At the close the High Priest handed
the .godmother a horn, at the sound of
which the kitten was to emerge from
its basket, thus to symbolize it* awak
ening to life. After the invocation of
Odin the High Priest baptized pussy
by the name of Belkis, which means
"pretty girl." Some appropriate lines
by Pierre Loti were then recited; and
the ceremony being at an end the com
pany adjourned to the buffet
Mail advices from the East contain a
description of a curious ceremony re
cently organized by the distinguished
writer Pierre Loti at Constantinople.
The author of "Madame Chrysan
theme" is the commander of the French
guardship Vautour, and in the early
days of December a kitten was born on
the man-of-war.
Pierre Loti decided to celebrate the
auspicious event In solemn fashion, and
a grand festival was organized In honor
of the kitten's baptism. The captain's
private apartments were beautifully
decorated with flowers, and at the hour
fixed for the ceremony numerous boats
put off from the shore with members
of the distinguished party invited for
the occasion. Among thoso present
were the Consul General of France, the
commanders of the British and Rus
sian warships, the Russian Naval At
tache and M. Coauelin, cadet. v. {
The kitten's distinguished godfather
was Vicomte de Salignac-Fenelon, and
the godmother was Mme. Roux, wife
of the commander of the Mouette, the
French dispatch vessel. A procession
was formed, and the company proceed
ed to one of the rooms, where an altar
dedicated to Odin had been erected.
Then Pierre Loti and his fellow-officers
opened the ceremony by a burlesque
symphony executed in admirable style.

York State, the chief oi the Continental
fortifications of the Hudson River Val

lished in 1802. At first provision was
made for only ten cadets.
The startling fact has been made public that more than
one hundred and thirty thousand tons of hemp are ex
ported , annually from the Philippines. The appalling
records of daily crime in the United States indicate very
clearly that we are not patronizing our island posses
sions for at least one of the commodities of which they
have an abundance and we a need.
After all has been said and done and explanations
have been given every color possible to the imagination,
it looks as if it is up to Japan to fight. The Russian is
irresistible in his fatalistic unconcern. He has given his
answer and the chip, which the little brown men have
balanced so long on their shoulders, is on the ground.
Nor from my torch, the gleam,
But from the stars above;
Not from our hearts, life's crystal

But from the depths of Love.
â Henry Van Dyke, in the January At

Not to the swift, the race;
Not to the strong, the flght;
Not to the righteous, perfect grace;
Not to the wise, the light.
But often faltering feet
Come surest to the goal,
And they who walk in darkness meet
The sunrise of the soul.

The Syrian hosts have died;
A thousand times the vanquished right
Has risen glorified*

Perhaps the most impressive of all
the abandoned channels which drain
ed vast floods southward in the gla
cial period is that of the great outlet
leading from the Red River Valley
of the North into the Minnesota
through Lake Traverse and Big Stone
Lake over the site of Browns Valley.
Here is a continuous channel a mile
or more in width from the northern
drainage basin (whose waters now
flow northward) into the southern,
Â¦with clearly defined banks and every
indication of its having been occupied
by an enormous current of water.
Upon surveying the country to the
north it was found that the vast wheat
region of the Red River Valley, ex
tending from the headwaters of the
river In Minnesota and far down into
Manitoba is simply the silted-up bot
tom of the temporary glacial lake
which poured its waters through
Browns Valley. Warren Upham has
traced the shore lines of this lake far
down into British America on both
s'des, proving that at one time It cov
ered an area of fully 100,000 square
miles, "which is several times that of
our present great lakes. This great
temporary body of water has been ap
propriately named Lake Agassiz. Mr.
Upham well remarks: "As we stand
upon the bluffs overlooking Browns
Valley and the long, narrow lakes on
either side *\ â¢ ? we have nearly
the picture thai was presented when
the melting ice sheet of British Amer
ica was pouring its floods along this
hollow. Then the entire extent of the
valley from one to one and a half
miles wide was doubtless filled every
summer by a river which covered all
the present areas of flood-plain."
Surely truth is stranger than fiction.

Herbert Spencer, while by no means
an unlikable man, far less unsocial, had
always about him a great deal of the
theorizing philosopher. Some who
knew him well would even say that he
was a pedant. The direct Influence upon
him of his father's strong character
was very great. The parent was a
teacher in the school of a Mrs. Turner,
In Nottingham, and that lady used to
speak of his talent for teaching in
most enthusiastic terms. While Spen
cer as a young man was working at
engineering his close friend and com
panion was Robert Thomson, who was
engaged In the same profession, and
was a man of striking mental power.
He predicted the fame of Spencer, and
used to give very graphic accounts of
his friend's excessive love for accuracy.
Spencer would* begin a sentence, pro
ceed some way, then interrupt himself
and say: "No; I will express what I
mean better in this way." choosing
then another form of words. An amus
ing instance of Spencer's tendency to
theorize on all occasions dwells in the
memory of one who witnessed It. The
company at the breakfast table had
had their letters brought to them, and
after a time Spencer remarked to the
hostess that he considered the social
custom of not opening letters before
others a senseless one. "Eut, Mr Spen
cer," said the lady, "everybody has
opened their letters but you." â London

Anecdote of Spencer.
BY the validating of the initiative and referendum
amendment to the State constitution Oregon has
practically abolished the Legislature and destroyed
representative government. Even the deliberation here
tofore considered in amending tÂ»he State constitution is
abolished and the fundamental law can be changed or
done away with by processes that require only four
months in their operation. This is the widest departure
from the principles of representative government yet
made by any American community. It constitutes that
method of direct government which students of civics
have said would be a failure even if every citizen were as
wise as Sir Isaac Newton. .
Representative government is conceived in a spirit of
deliberation, of patient examination of measures, bringing
them to the judgment of those qualified to rationalize
them, and to -protect the rights of minorities as well as
of majorities. Mr. Jefferson understood this when he said
that "the rule of the, majority, to be right, must be reas
onable." Representative republican government has been
believed to be reasonable government, while there is a
grave doubt whether non-representative government, or
government by direct action of a majority, will long ob
serve the limitations of reason, or will long respect the
rights of a minority.
If the example of Oregon spread, it is easily conceiv
able that what has been done there, in a. State, may be
done by a majority of the States in respect to the Fed
eral Government itself. Then stability will cease. When
a constitution, the fundamental law, can be changed with
out deliberation, at the polls, without the change having
been considered by a representative body, every change
in popular opinion will be impressed upon the constitu
tion. Heretofore party control of States and of the
Union has very infrequently caused changes in the funda
mental law of either. Such changes, when made, have
recorded the deliberate purpose of the people to impress
that law with some great principle always vital and al
ways necessary. But under direct government such
changes may represent only the passion and partisanship
of the hour.
The Oregon experiment will be watched with keen
interest. That it begins in the midst of lively apprehen
sions of the result is shown in the remark of a citizen
of that State, that "the only safety for the minority "now
rests in the good (sense of the majority, and the excel
lent, facilities for transportation out of the State."
RADICALISM IN OREGON.
She could not have been a day over
20 years of age, and she was zemark
ably good looking. In fact, so regular
were her features, so trim her figure
and so fetching her carriage, that she
she attracted attention even on Market
street on a matinee day. Th* eyes of a
cigar store masher lit upon her as she
tripped daintily by his "stand," and she
looked so good to him that he needs
must wish to become acquainted. Ac
cordingly he adjusted his hat. rubbed
a crease out of his gloves, buttoned his
coat and throwing out his chest, started
in her wake. At the corner of O'Farrell
and Market he passed her. At a con
cenvlent cigar store he stopped, posed,
and as she came opposite' him, smiled
his sweetest smile and winked a stereo
typed wink.
But he got only a haughty look in
return. Nothing daunted, he followed
the trim figure. Again he passed her;
once more he posed at a convenient
point, and repeated the smile and wink.

Throughout the Southern States the
railroads have done as effective work
as th Â»y have done in the far West The
Southern Railway, the Atlantic Coast
Line, the Louisville and Nashville, the
Seaboard Air Line, and two or three
other Mnos have actually created a new
industrial South. Wherever a fair
chance has offered to establish a fac
tory, a cotton mill, a sugar or fruit
plantation, a mining enterprise or a
tannery, the railroad men have done
tbCTr part without urging. Railroad
money has bought sites for new manu
factories, and It has often guaranteed
the cost of building the factory.
Branch roads and short spurs have
been built in every direction to give
At least a score of American rail
roads have had industrial and immi
grant agencies abroad for several years
past. Often colonization plans are
completed before the colonizers leave
their homes In the old country. The
Bite for the proposed settlement on the
line of a certain railroad is selected,
terms of purchase are agreed upon,
rates' of fare and various incidental
concessions and inducements put in
Tvritingr. The newcomers are received
upon landing here by an agent of the
particular railroad that has indnced
them to come and conveyed to their
prospective township or village with
"neatness and dispatch."
Then begins the task of establishing
a permanent, self-supporting commu
nity. The railroad company has no
thought of leaving Its colonizers to
shift for themselves. Co-operation be
comes the order of the day. It is the
railroad company that forwards build
ing materials, makes cash advances
â¢when necessary to stimulate the work
of construction and promotes industrial
development by giving remunerative
employment to the carpenters, the ma
chinists and the blacksmith. First the
railroad builds a station and hires local
help, next the railroad helps to build a
town hall, a church and perhaps a
ecnoolhouse. The village store is a
natural evolution, and for quite a while
the railroad company purposely throws
trade in its way. Bulletins are issued
periodically by the industrial bureau of
the railroad, telling of the steady
growth of the new village and detail
ing Its needs and advantages. These
bulletins are circulated systematically
in such a way as to keep Sweden Four
Corners, or whatever the name of the
place may be, in constant commercial
touch with other trade centers.
In recent years the industrial depart
ment has become a very important ad
junct of a great railroad system. Elab
orate industrial and commercial
projects are worked out by railroad
men in order to create business for
their roads, and the aggregate result
of their labors in this direction is an
enormous contribution to the country's
growth by the upbuilding of new com
munities. Almost every railroad in the
West offers special inducements to
farmers and mechanics to locate homes
along their respective routes. Only
recently E. H. Harrlman, the head of
the Union Pacific system, Instructed
his subordinates to follow a liberal as
well as an alert policy in dealing with
settlers. Purchasers of farm lands are
to have the easiest of terms, and such
inducements are to be offered to man
ufacturers, tradesmen and mechanics
as will practically insure them an ad
vantageous start. The Union Pacific
Company still lias several hundred
thousands of acres of its grant lands to
dispose of. and the power and influence
of the railroad are to be exerted to
populate these acres.
The present financial prosperity of
the Great Northern Railway is largely
due to its systematic work in planting
settlements all along its line from St.
Paul to the Pacific Coast. Considera
bly more than half of these settlements
were established entirely through the
efforts of the railroad company. In very
few instances was there any spontane
ous growth. These settlements were
"Induced" by active, watchful and in
genious industrial agents, working not
only in this country, but in England,
Germany, Sweden, Italy and France.

President Roosevelt has bravely shown that the quite
comprehensive laws we have can be .enforced. He was
instrumental in the legislation that provided the New
Department of Commerce and gave it jurisdiction over
trusts and corporations. It is required to make them file
statements such as should Be made public. All have
complied except the Standard Oil Company, which re
fuses. Here is Mr. Hitchcock's chance. Let him go at
once for the' bald eagle of the trusts, John D. Rockefeller,
and make him put in that statement. If he try to hide be
hind, the constitutional provision that persons and pa
pers shall not be subjected, to unreasonable search or
seizure, it will be necessary to show that the demand of
the Government for proper publicity is not unreasonable.
So if Mr. Hitchcock does not find work, it is because he
is hunting for it only at Jackson dinners.
The principal talk seems to have been emitted by Mr.
Hitchcock, member of Congress and Mr. Bryan's former
newspaper associate in the Omaha World-Herald. He
dwelt on the growing necessity for government regula
tion of aggregated wealth. His speech was barren of
any plan for legislation to that end, but it was lurid in its
statement of the case, and the necessity for law that
would not be laggard. He took a back sight and saw the
evil growing for the past forty years. If nothing has
been done in that time, the country is fortunate in having
Mr. Hitchcock in Congress to do something now, right
away. He will be back in his seat in the House on the
4th inst., and surely he will not delay a moment in
flinging his legislative lasso around the horns of aggre
gated wealth.
That aggregation, either physical or financial, implies
the power of organization, is self-evident. That such
power is apt to be misused is confirmed by the history ? of
mankind. All power, .including that of a man over what
is his own, is subject to misuse, and therein is the reason
why we have a. system of laws, representing the consen
sus of the opinion of society, for the regulation and con
firmation and protection of rights, and the limitation of
power.
Mr. Hitchcock is mistaken in his assumption that noth
ing has been done in the last forty years to curb the
power of aggregated wealth. The shape in which such
aggregation first became formidable was in the transition
of transportation from its primitive form to railways and
steam. This required the use of money beyond the
power of one individual, or a few only, to supply, so the
railway corporation appeared, with its issue of commer
cial paper in the form of bonds and stocks. If Mr.
Hitchcock will look into the statistics and decisions,
State* and national, he will discover an immense body of
law grown up in the last forty years, to hedge in that
form of aggregated wealth, until railroads have to main
tain a staff of the ablest lawyers to tell them what they
may do and what omit legally, in the transaction of their
vast business.
Turning to the more modern form of wealth which
scares him, the trusts, he will find a copious addition to
the other statutes and decisions, curbing trusts, and he
will be pleased to discover that in the last three years
these laws have been rigidly enforced, resulting in the
building up of a line of judicial decisions which point the
way to further curative, preventive and protective legis-.
lation. He will find most of the trusts floored by the law
and on their backs yelling for mercy.
Now is the time for him to get in. The legal literature
of the subject has been enriched by the law briefs of the
ablest attorneys in the United States. The field is invit
ing; it is white for the harvest, and if Mr. Hitchcock will
take his sickle out of his mouth and put in his hand and
get at work he has the chance to do something. He is
a very rich man himself, and therefore we advise him not
to load his legislative gun to hit if it's a deer and miss if
it's a calf. If his own investments run into some of these
offensive aggregations, he must not be afraid to shoot
himself in the pocket, if that be necesary, in order to in
flict wholesome discipline.
THE Democratic Jackson Club of Nebraska has met
and fed in advance of Jackson day. Though both
the gold and silver wings flopped together at table,

by the presence of their separate brethren.

Intention of "hitching up," and the

his bearings, wandered into the Police
Court and applied to the clerk for the
license. The clerk was somewhat of
a practical joker, and he looked grave,
asked the usual questions and proceed
ed to draw up the paper. He put the
document in a large envelope, with the
applicant's name written thereon, and
smilingly refused to accept the fee
which was proffered.
The prospective groom left In a happy
frame of mind, with the document
stowed safely away in his pocket, and
on the following day he and the bride
to-be sought a minister. When the
clergyman was about to perform the
ceremony he asked for the license. The
groom handed him the envelope still
unopened. The reverend gentleman
opened the envelope, and after scruti
nizing the document he turned to the
groom and remarked In a horrified tone,
""Well, this is an Irregular Instrument!"
The envelope contained a warrant for
the arrest of Jane Doe.

The Wrong Document.
THE NEBRASKA CLANS FEED.
Since the establishment of industrial
bureaus by the Pennsylvania, the Erie,
the Lacka wanna and Â¦ other Eastern
trunk lines there has been a marked
increase in suburban development. A
large amount of new capital has been
interested in the construction of ho
tels and cottages, and in many places
in Pennsylvania and New York farm
lands have been transformed into flour
ishing villas or manufacturing towns.
A common method followed ly the rail
roads in the development of new su
burban resorts is to buy a tract of well
wooded land, build and equip a neat
hotel and then put up cottages for sale
on the Installment plan to suit such de
mand as may be aroused by judicious
and persistent advertising.
One of the most interesting features
of railroad helpfulness in agricultural
communities is the Illinois Central's
school of instruction in roadmaking.
Some years ago an observing and sa
gacious officer of the Illinois Central
ascertained that the bad condition of
the country roads interfered with ship
ments of farm products on the rail
road and minimized passenger traffic.
Expert attention was at once given to
this subject and a stirring campaign
in behalf of good roads was started
throughout the entire southern region
traversed by the Illinois Central Rail
road. An intelligent interest was awak
ened among the farmers, and clubs
were formed to receive instruction in
the art of making good roads. The
railroad company paid the cost of this
instruction and aided the country peo
ple in other ways in improving the con
dition of the public highways. This
work is pushed energetically each year
and already the Illinois Central feels
its good effects in a large increase in
local freight and passenger traffic. The
Illinois Central management is now
giving scientific attention to the subject
of forestry. Chiefly with a view of pro
viding timber for future use in the
making of ties, etc., this company is
planting scores of thousands of trees
on its own lands.

"taken into custody. Yesterday morn
ing he was examined and the physi
cians decided to hold him for observa
tion. Wulff insists that his wife and
four sons, Henry, John, William and
Frank, are conspiring to have him
railroaded to an asylum with the ulti
mate intention of securing control of
his property. The estate consists of a
ranch in Sacramento County and prop
erty in' the Richmond district.
â¢ Attorney Thompson claims his atten
tion was called to the case by mer
chants with whom Wulff had done busi
ness for a number, of years. They were
impressed with Wulff's story, and as
cases of sane men being shipped to In
sane asylums are by no means rare,
desired that the case be carefully in
vestigated.
The members of Wulff's family claim
that their sole desire in causing his ar
rest is to prevent him from ending his
life. They say there is no mercenary
motive back of the complaint, as in
that case they would have applied for
guardianship . papers.

Last evening there was a reunion
of worshipful masters who recently re
tired from nineteen local lodges, of re
cently installed masters and of junior
and senior wardens of these lodges in
one of the leading rotlsseries. There
was discussed an account of the work
that the board has done during the
last year. The report read showed that
there was expended for the relief of
Masons in the jurisdiction of California
$1869, of Masons in other Jurisdictions
in the United States $5672, of foreign
jurisdictions $4703. It was also shown
that the disbursement for charities by
the board since 1856, when it was or
ganized, amounts In the aggregate to
$431,329. During 1903 the board attended
to last rites in the cases of sixteen
members of the fraternity. At the re
union the matter of the proposed hos
pital was discussed, and those present
were interested in the matter with a
view that steps shall soon be taken to
bring about the desired result.
After the supper there was presented
to Edwin W. Tucker a token of appre
ciation of the service he had rendered
the board in the shape of a valuable
clock of the grandfather pattern, after
which a number of those who were as
sociated with him, in appreciation of
the work he had done to advance the
movement for the proposed hospital,
presented him with a large silver lov
ing-cup, on which appears engraved a
fac simile of the signature of the don
ors. These are H. M. Owen of Califor
nia Lodge. A. Hugenfn of La Parfalte
Union, J. A. Snook and C. E. Landis of

cisco, A. C. Bauer of Doric, W. P. Fil
mer and G. W. Lake*bf King Solomon,
J. A. Bright of Starr King and J. H.
Boyd of Presidio Lodge. These were all
present at the reunion, and in addition
there were C. Schlessinger," J. A. Wright,
H. J. Gerhardt, D. S. Hirshberg, C. H.
Penwell, J. A. Watson, C. T. Cleve and
R. G. Mantel.
After the various propositions brought
up had been discussed there was an
hour of toasts and speechmaking. '
The attention of the Masonic frater
nity in this city has for some time been
alive to the necessity of greeting a Ma
sonic hospital in this State, to be an
adjunct to the Masonic Home at De
coto. In this movement Edwin W.
Tucker, chairman, and E. C. Hare, sec
retary of the Masonic board of relief,
have been very active. In 'a circular
addressed to every lodge in the State
the officers named say:
At the present time every lodge In this
State is compelled to send Its aged and in
flrm brethren to the different hospitals in their
respective cities, because they are refused ad
mittance to the home, as there are no accom
modations for them, and for which the lodges
would gladly pay the same aa they do at the
hospitals, knowing full well that their breth
ren would receive every care and attention.
We believe that It is absolutely necessary
that this step shQuld be taken, and that each
and every Mason In the State of California
will have a better and higher appreciation of
the beauties of our great fraternity when
this work has been accomplished. This will
entail an expense of about $50,000, and It will
be necessary to devise ways and means to
raise this amount, and it has been suggested
that we give a fair, to be held entirely under
the auspices of the Masonic fraternity, and
to that end we submit this proposition to the
different lodges, asking each and every one to
thoroughly dlacuss the matter and send us
their views.

The holiday vacation for the enlisted
men at the Presidio came to an end
yesterday and the regular routine work
of the post will again be taken up. For
the past ten days, beginning with field
day, as is always the custom at this
post, drills have entirely been done
away with, and only the work neces
sary to post duties has been indulged
in. Baseball and other outdoor sports
have been the order of the day, and
into these all the troops have entered
with great gusto and enthusiasm.
Now they will have a chance to enter
into their regular drills with renewed
force and vigor after their respite from
work.
Drill call for field artillery and caval
ry will be at 8:05 every morning, ex
cept Saturday and Sunday, and coast
artillei'y on the same days at 8:50.
Guard mount every day in the year
will be at 11 a. m. The band will par
ticipate each day and at the conclusion
will play three selections.
The Twenty-eighth Infantry, which
is coming home on the transport Sheri
dan, is due here about the 14th inst.
The Sheridan is expected to arrive at
Honolulu about the 5th.
William Ryan, an employe in the
quartermaster's department at the
Presidio, got mixed up in the New
Year's celebration at Harbor View
Park, and in the general hilarity of
the occasion, managed to get shot in
the arm. Exactly how it happened he
is not able to say. The wound, while
painful, is not serious and he will soon
be as good as new.

YOU WELL BE ALIi

Forget Your Stomach and You'll
Have a Santa Clans Face.
HOW TO DO IT.
If there Is one thing more than all
others that will give a man a forlorn
and friendless appearance and make
him morbid and "cranky" and dis-
agreeable that thing is dyspepsia. It
makes one forget his friends and be-
come morose and irritable. He is so
wrapped up in his own misery that
he is inconsiderate of every one .else.
Relieved of this terrible and depressing
ailment, he again becomes a good fel-
low and a man among men.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are be-
yond Question the most effective and
popular remedy ever offered to the suf-
ferers of this terrible disease. The thou-
sands and thousands of cures they have
brought about and the enormous in-
crease of their sales fully attest the
truth of this statement.
They are, above all, a natural rem-
edy. They possess exactly the same
properties that the gastric juices and
other digestive fluids of the stomach
possess and they actually do the diges-
tive wqrk of the stomach and enable
that organ to rest and recuperate and
become sound and well. They act in
a mild, natural manner and cause no
disturbance in the digestive organs.
They prevent any fermentation of the
food, which causes sour stomach. In
fact, under their influence the subject
forgets that he has a stomach and his
resulting cheerfulness presents a great
contrast to his former dejection.
Millions .of boxes of Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets are sold annually and they
are but Jn the dawn of their popularity.
Every mail brings letters of thanksgiv-
ing from grateful ones who have been
cured of this terrible disease. The fol-
lowing is one of hundreds received each
week:
. Rev. J. R. Hoae of Wymore, Neb.,
writes: "For six years I have been
troubled with dyspepsia. Last fall I
became very much alarmed at some
symptoms of heart trouble and came
to believe there was a sympathetic re-
lation between the two diseases, or
rather that the stomach trouble was the
cause of the heart disturbances. I hit
upon Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets for a
remedy and Invested a dollar and a
half for three boxes, wnich lasted me
three months, and I can eat any kind
of food I want and have a good, vig-
orous appetite. Although I am 77 years
old, I now feel perfectly well and, with-
out being requested by any one, I make
this statement as a compliment to thÂ«S
virtues of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets."

BEER BOTTLERS' ORGANIZATION.
To Secure the Return of Their Bottles.
â¢An organization has just been perfect

protect its members in the matter of
securing the return of empty bottles.
Commencing this morning all patrons of
beer bottlers in San Francisco will be
required -to, pay a deposit on each and
every bottle, of , beer delivered to them,
said deposlt'being security for the safe
return to beer bottlers of their patent
stoppers -attached' to their beer bottles,
and said patrons will further be required
to return the empty bottles bearing the
registered trade marks and trade names
of the beer bottler. The organization is
composed of all-the,beer bottlers in San
Francisco. \ without exception, and â¢ in
consequence', it will have sufficient
strength to carry out its objects. It does

A train is never missed till . it's

The Supreme Court yesterday denied
a rehearing to Charles .Wardrjp, who
Is under sentence of death for murder
ing Hugh Duffy two years ago in Sac
ramento while attempting to burglar
ize his victim's house. In the destruc
tion of the criminal's last chance of
escape from the gallows the court de
clares that the law compelling a Judge
to charge the Jury to regard the testi
mony of an accomplice, with distrust is
unconstitutional.
Wardrlp had a boy hb his companion
in the commission of the crime j for
which he must die. The youth was cap
tured on the spot. Wardrip was taken
several weeks later in Salt Lake City.
When he was brought back to Sac
ramento for trial the boy testified
against him. The attorneys for the
defense wished to have the court rule
that the youngster's statements should
be taken with a grain- of salt. , Thus
was the matter â¢ bro.ught to the . atten
tion of the State's highest tribunal. In
settlement of the question the Supreme
Court says:
"In denying a rehearing In this case
it Is proper to add>that upon the ques
tion bs to the constitutionality of : our
statue providing thai j the jury is on
all proper occasions to. be Instructed
that the testimony of an accomplice
ought to be viewed with distrust, and
the evidence of the oral admission of
a party with caution, which question
was fully argued both in the briefs
herein and orally, we are of the opin
ion that so far as the statute requires
such an instruction ever to be given
It is unconstitutional, for the reason
that such an Instruction would be In
violation of the constitutional Injunc
tion against Judges charging as to mat
ters of fact.
"It has frequently been said by this
court that the civlng of such an" In
struction will not be reversible error
where by it the jury is instructed as
to commonplace matters within their
general 'knowledge, "but t\ r e'a\re satis
fled that judgment should never be re
versed for the. refusal on the - Dart of
the court to Instruct upon matters of
fact."

Not only will the men have to work
on each drill night, but the commis
sioned officers will have to study up in
order to be- able to impart the neces
sary knowledge to the men. Many of
those who in the past have held com
misions in order that they might sport
uniforms and shine at social functions
will find under the new order of things
that they will have to become proficient
in the art of war or their commissions
will- be in danger.
The inspections on behalf of the
United States "War Department, in or
der that the authorities may know the
exact standing and condition of the va
rious organizations in this State, will
commence this nymth, and such will be
closer than they have ever been. Upon
the report to be furnished will depend
much of the help that the United States
Government will extend to the National
Guard of this State. If it is found care
less, negligent and Indifferent but little
assistance will be rendered, but if there
is evidence of a desire to make the
State soldiery anything like what it is
thought it ought to be, then material
aid will be given.
The oilicers and men will hava to do
their level best to create a first-class
deputation unless thcr desire to suffer
greatly by comparisons, for thls-yc-ar
the National Guard will go into camp
with the. regulars, for two reasons â
first, that they learn something about
camp life . by observing how the regu
lars conduct a camp, and, second, to
give the inspectors an opportunity to
ete how much or how little they know
of camp duties.
The course that has been mapped out
is along the lines suggested by Colonel
Wilhelm, United States army inspector,
at * various times in the past four
months. This will include thorough in
struction in the- setting-up exercises,
so that the men in uniform will look
like soldiers, and not - like an army of
stoop-shouldered, round-backed men,
whose appearance is not creditable on
parade or at drill; also instruction in
the manual of arms, and to this strict
attention will have to be paid, as the
men . have' been * provided with Krag-
Jorgensens, which must be * handled
with much more care than the old
Springfields. Not only will the men be
instructed in the handling of the, to
them, new arm, but they will be in
structed in the care of the same. Then
there will be instruction in cadence of
step, and it is expected that in time
the men will be taught to walk at the
regulation step and keep distance, so
that in marching there will not be an
interm.'ssion of ten minutes after one
organization has passed before the oth
er appears. This will be embraced in
the preliminary work, to be followed
by complete instruction in squad, com
pany, regimental and brigade move
ments.
Commencing to-morrow there will be,
it is expected, a radical reform in the
National Guard of California, for or
ders have gone forth that there must
be more attention in the rank and file
to military duties than there has been
in the past. These orders have been
issued in the hope that black marks
that have been scored against the ef
ficiency of the guard may be effaced.

ing an overcharge of $2844 60, which
demands were approved by former
County Clerk Deane, former Auditor
Wells and ex-Treasurer Brooks. The
demands, however, were not approved
by the Board of Â¦ Supervisors. Lane
advises that the city has redresa
against Wells and Brook?, who should
not have paid the demands since they
were not approved by the Supervisors.
Lane, however, is of the opinion that
the County Clerk can only be held
liable in case the demands were so
grossly excessive n.s to necessarily im
ply a breach of duty and carelessne3s
amounting to official misconduct In
approving the same.

Immediately after suspending
"Walsh the Mayor notified Chief Dep
uty Zemansky and Deputy Registrar
Gordon that he would hold each of
them personally responsible for the
safety of the ballots, which are now
in the Registrar's vault at the City
Hall.
Mayor Schmitz said that arrange
ments should be made to ship the
ballots so that the legal custodian
thereof could be in constant posses
sion of them, and this will be done.
The ballots weigh 1100 pounds and
the Mayor ascertained that when
Walsh arranged to ship them to
Washington on his own responsibility
last Thursday Wells, Fargo & Co. sent
a wagon to take them to the train,
but the wagon was too light and the
company's representative promised to
send a heavier wagon the next day.
The Mayor thought there was no need
for haste, as the Congressional investi
gation will not begin until January 14.

The only previous action taken by
the Election Commission was at a

Chief Deputy Zemansky was directed
to take charge of the department of
elections in the absence of Registrar
Walsh in case he i3 subpenaed to ap

The Election Commission met in the
afternoon and Commissioner Boyle
announced that Walsh had agreed to
accompany in person the ballots to
Washington and Mayor Schmitz had
revoked his order suspending Walsh.
The communication from the Mayor
revoking Walsh's suspension was
read, as follows:
"The Board of Election Commission

of Voters and secretary of the Board
of Election Commissioners, who was

secretary, was formerly the Washing

that friends. of Senator Hanna, noting
the widespread popularity c-f.the Ohio
man, are very active In his behalf, not
withstanding the repeated declarations
of the Senator that he would not be
a candidate for > President. It is said
by Hanna's intimate friends that the
Senator Recently declared, somewhat
regretfully, that he had already writ
ten more than 1000 letters positively de
clining to be a candidate and he did
not, see how he could now gracefully
accept a nomination if it were tendered
him. Th's declaration induces friends
of the Senator - to . believe that If the
widespread;popular sentiment In favor
of his nomination crystallized in the
national' convention Hanna could be
prevailed, upon to accept the nomina

officially ventured as to who would in
the future control the affairs of the
company. Burt himself will remain
nominally in charge of affairs, but ex
pects to begin at once the preparation
for h!s departure.
Burt's resignation, It is learned, has
l>cen in the hands of the directors for
Borne time, although the fact was not
made public' until to-day. It is be
lieved that the board will accept It, as
Burt has been very explicit in his ex
pression of his desire to retire from the
company's services.
President Burt has nothing to add to
the announcement already made of his
resignation beyond saying that he ex
pected to rr.ake his future and perma
nent home in Omaha. He said that he
had no plans beyond his intention of
traveling lor some tim%.
OMAHA, Jan. 2.â Horace G. Burt,
president of the Union Pacific Railroad,
has handed his resignation to the di
rectors. At Burt's office it was said
that he would take an extended trip
with Mrs. Burt to obtain a needed rest.
His active railroad service has extend
ed over thirty-five years.
President Burt was appointed to his
present position in February, 189S,
shortly after the receivership of the
read was dissolved. y\. large number of
changes and improvements have been
rjirried through by him. one of the
greater of which has been the expendi
ture o* more? than Sl.090,000 in the con
struction of new shops at Omaha-
Previous to his appointment as presi
dent of the Union Pacific system Burt
was oonneced with the Chicago and
Northwestern road for nearly thirty
years. He served in tne capacity of
: hief engineer and general manager of
the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri
Valley Railroad, now part of the North
western system, and was later made
vice president of the latter road, in
which capacity he was serving when
he came to the Union Pacific.
Tickets for the benefit have been
placed on sale and hundreds have been
disposed of. They can be secured by
applying to Mr. Stanley, in the Pioneer
building.
Preparations for the coming concert
for the benefit of the McKinnon memo
rial fund, which will take place at tha
Mechanics' Pavilion on the evenings of
January 21, are now well under way.
The committee in charge announces
that the services of the famous "fight
ing band" of the deceased chaplain's
regiment will be heard in conection
with other noted musical organizations.
The "fighting: band" is the band that
was with the First California Regiment
at Manila, and earned its title through
the bravery of its members during the
campaign. Most of its members are
San Francisco boys, and when the war
was over they returned to their homes.
Father McKinnon was very popular
with the band boys, and when the ben
efit for a monument to be erected to
his memory was planned the boys at
once volunteered their services for thÂ»j
good cause. The band consists of thir
ty-two pieces, under the direction of
George W. Hollister, and has taken
several prises at different public con
certs.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 2.â A whirlwind
of indignation is raging about the ears
of the Rev. W. W. Case, pastor of the
Sixth-street Methodist Church, because
of his attack on the Tuesday Literary
Club's grand ball to be given at Turner
Hall next Thursday night.
The Rev. Mr. Case declares he is un
shaken in bis opposition to the dance
on moral and ethical grounds, and that
at his church to-morrow night he will
elaborate his twenty-five reasons, why
the Tuesday Club should abandon the
society dance, which Governor Pardee
and wife have been invited to lead.
The Tuesday Club is the largest and
most influential literary organization
in Northern California. It includes in
its membersmp several hundred of the
representative women of Sacramento,
including al} the leaders of society. It
has undertaken to build for itself a
handsome home, and in furtherance of
this plan has arranged for a series of
social events. The nrst of these, given
a month ago, was a "poster party" at
the home of Mrs. William Beckman,
and it was a brilliant success. The sec
ond event is to be a full dress ball next
Thursday night.
While preparations for the dance
were at their height the Rev. Mr. Case,
pastor of the leading Methodist church
congregation in the city, appealed to
the women to abandon the project,
at the same time calling upon the Gov
ernor to decline to join hands with the
"devotees of the dance, whose upper
stratum includes the splendid Tuesday
Club of Sacramento, but whose lower
stratum is found in all the dives of our
cities."
To The Call correspondent to-night
Mrs. William Beckman, one of the lead
ing members' of the Tuesday Club and
the hostess at the "poster party." said
she had talked with many members of
the Tuesday Club, and they regarded
the Rey. Mr. Case's remarks as un
called for.
"I am sure," said Mrs. Beckman,
"that our dance will be on a much high
er and on a more moral plane than the
average church fair, where nothing is
thought of lotteries and grab-bags, and
sometimes, if I must say it, cheating. I
permitted nothing of the sort at my
'poster party.' There was one admission
fee and that was all. I permitted no
devices whatever toâ¢xtort money. I do
not believe all church fairs can say as
much."
Mrs. Beckman said she had no desire
to enter into any controversy on the
subject, but she felt that the Tuesday
Club had been unjustly criticized.
It has developed that, notwithstand
ing the Indignation expressed against
the Rev. Mr. Case by members- of the
Tuesday Club, there is an undercurrent
of opposition to the dance on,' the paÂ»t
of not a few members of the- club. Mrs.
A. A. â¢ Goddard, the president of the
club, said she personally had not ad
vised the feature, and she looked upon
the club as a great influence, with far
higher purposes than the giving of
balls, but as the event was proposed in
aid of the building fund she had not
opposed it.
FIRST CALIFORNIA'S BAND
MASTER. WHO WILL AS
SIST AT THE BENEFIT.
John P. Coghlan. as third assistant,

held that position for two terms under
Mr. Lane. He has been practicing law
for five years past and in addition act
ing as court reporter for an evening

Dorn as fourth assistant. He is a grad
uate of Albany College, Oregon, and
has been practicing law since 1895. He
was for one term Assistant District At

became associated with Major C. L. Til
den, with whom he has since been en
gaged ' in the practice of the law.
Though Mr. Nourse's appointment will
take effect at once he will not assume
his office for a few weeks, as Richard
Sims, whom he will succeed, is engaged
in the trial of several cases which
Judge Long wishes him to conclude be
fore giving away to Mr. Nourse.
William H. Smith Jr.. whom Judge
Long has named as clerk, is a young
lawyer of ability. He has been prac

civil and probate > litigation. He will
succeed Harry R. White, who has been
in the office since the beginning of Mr/

fession, particularly in probate and
municipal law. Among recent cases in
which he has had a prominent part
were the contest over the Cogswell es
tate and the settlement of the Baird
estate. Mr. Partridge was chairman of
the late Republican Municipal Conven
tion and of the Republican Judicial
Convention of last year. The position
which he will hold under Judge Long
is- now filled by George W. Lane, a
brother of Franklin K. Lane.
William I. â¢ Brobeck, who will be re
tained by Judge Long, has been in the
City Attorney's office eleven years.
During that time he has handled some
of ; the most ' Important litigation in
;\fhich the city was interested. At pres

Supreme Court, and of the Bank of
California and the San Mateo railroad
assessment cases, now awaiting a hear

was affiliated with the United Republi
can League at the last election. He has
been associated with J..M. Rothschild

is also a practicing attorney.
Governor Pardee yesterday appointed
Isidore Golden to be Justice of the
Peace to succeed Percy V.' Long, who
resigned to assume the office of City
Attorney, to which he was elected Ia3i
November. Long filed notice with the
Board of Supervisors and Mayor
Schmitz that he had filed his resigna
tion with the Secretary of State, and
the Mayor at once appointed Walter
Gallagher to the vacancy. His Honor
claims that he has the right of ap
pointment under article 4. chapter 1,
section 4 of the charter. The conflict of
authority in the matter will probably
have to be settled by the courts.\
Gdlden at once took the oath of of
fice before Notary Public Hess and filed
the attested document with the Regis
trar.
"Sir: . You are hereby officially not
ified tÂ»f the foregoing order of suspen
sion, \ind that you have been and are
suspeided from the office of secretary
''Dated January 2, 1904."
the Mayor then issued the follow
ing notice, to Walsh as secretary of
the Board of Election Commissioners
and Registrar of Voters: .
"Whereas, Sjuch delivery to such un
authorized persons is against law and
establishes a precedent dangerous to
the safety and purity of our election
system; and
"Whereas. Said Thomas J. Walsh de
clares that he will at once leave the
State of California without applying to
the Mayor for permission so to do
(contrary to the provisions of the
charter) and that he will cause the
said ballots to be taken out of the
State without the authority or consent
of or consultation with the Board of
Election Commissioners of the city
and county of San Francisco; and
"Whereas, Further, the term of of
flpe of said Thomas J. Walsh as such
Registrar and secretary of the Board
of Election Commissioners will expire
on January 8, 1904. and said ballots,
if in the custody of said Walsh after
said date, will not be in the custody of
a public official, nor in official control,
but will be outside of the State of Cali
fornia, and outside of the jurisdiction
of the city and county of San Fran
cisco and of any of its officials; and.
"Whereas, Ample time would under
the subpena (issued by the Commit
tee on Elections No. 1 of the House
of Representatives and dated Decem
ber 24, 1903,) be allowed the successor
of said Thomas J. Walsh as Registrar
Voters and secretary of the Board of
Election Commissioners (to which
successor the subpena of said commit
tee of t.he House of Representatives is
also directed) to comply with its di
rections and to appear before the said
committee on the day fixed in said su
pena. to-wlt, January 14, 1904.
"Nov.-, Therefore, by virtue of the
power vested in me by the charter of

and for the causes and reasons above
set forth, I do hereby suspend the said
Thomas J. Walsh from the office of
secretary of the Board of Election
Commissioners and Registrar of Voters
of the city and county of San Fran
tisco pending further investigation
into the- mutters hereinbefore re
ftrred to. E. E. SCHMITZ,
"Mayor of the City and County of San
', Francisco.
"Whereas, The said Thomas J.
Walsh has taken said ballots from the
official vault in which they have been
kept and placed them in trunks or
wooden boxes, and has attempted and
is about to deliver the same to such
unauthorized persons; and
DELIVERY* IS ILLEGAIj.
"I do," replied the Mayor, who there
upon issued the following order sus
pending Walsh: /
"Whereas, Thomas J. Walsh, Regis
trar of Voters of the city and county
of San Francisco and secretary of the
Board of Election Commissioners of
( said city and county, declares his In
tention, and has made preparation to
deliver the ballots cast in the Fourth
Congressional District of the State of
California at the election held Novem
ber 4, 1902, to a person or persons not
officials of the city and county of San
Francisco, and not legally, or at all,
entitled to the custody thereof; and
"Do you"* mean to say that in the
presence of these witnesses?" said
Walsh.
"Well." said Walsh, " "I don't know
about that. In fact, I da not think it
Is necessary, as the box in which they
will be sent will be pealed by me. I will
go on any train I please." "
"Then you propose to leave the State
Â¦without first obtaining permission from
your superiors in office?" asked the
Mayor.
"Well, I do not think that is neces
sary." replied Walsh.
'Well, I give you notice," said the
Mayor, "that I suspend you from your
office." */?
In answer to the Mayor's question,
Walsh replied that he intended leaving
for Washington on Sunday.
"Have you applied to the Election
Commissioners for a leave of absence
to go beyond the limits of the State?"
asked the Mayor.
"No." said Walsh. "The citation from
Washington is the only order upon
which I. am acting."
"Will you be upon the same train
upon which the ballots are sent?" in
quired the Mayor.
"Mr. Walsh's term of office will ex
pire on January S, and should he go to
Washington to be present at the Con
gressional investigation on January 14
he will no longer be Registrar and the
ballots will be in the possession of one
not legally empowered to be their cus
todian."
The Mayor explained that Walsh had
announced his determination to proceed
to Washington on a citation issued by
the United States Government, saying:
WALSH'S TER3I EXPIRES.
The Mayor had issued a call for 11
o'clock for a conference in his office of
the Election Commissioners and mother
interested parties, with the expressed
intention of arriving at some amicable
adjustment of the difficulty. Attorney
Dibble was also present at the confer
ence to look out for ex-Congressman
Kahn's interests.
Mayor Schmitz yesterday morning
suspended Registrar of Voters Thomas,
J. Walsh as the result of the contro
versy over Walsh's announced intention
to accompany the ballots of the Fourth
Congressional District, which have
been ordered to Washington, D. C., in
the Congressional contest of Kahn ver
sus Livernash. Within four hours after
ward the Mayor revoked his order sus
pending Walsh, who immediately filed
his resignation as Registrar with the
Board of Election Commissioners, to
take effect at 12 o'clock to-morrow.
George P. Adams was at once appoint
ed Registrar of Voters by the Election
Commission to succeed Walsh, who was
then appointed a special deputy regis
trar to serve until he returns from
Washington with the ballots, which
have been entrusted to his care.

The mile selling selection was far
from being a true run race. Constel

nearly all the big fellows unloaded at
7 to 10. Tommy Burns hustled the
Keating horse along too much early in
the game, and found his mount shy
of speed the last eighth. Bell rode a
perfect race on Pat Morrissey, winning
well in hand from El Oriente, another
outsider.
Possibly on paper Mountebank looked

Because of having Tommy Burns on
his back. Capable held the honors of
favoritism, but quite evidently belongs
to the false alarm species.
There was another large attendance
at Ingleside track yesterday, although
the crowd looked small when compared
with the vast holiday throng of the
preceding day.
The card was an ordinary one, with
a six-furlong handicap as the feature
event. Harry Stover's pet bird Kenil
worth, with 124 pounds and Tommy
Burns up, went to the post favorite at
5 to 2, after opening an 8 to 5 choice.
The brown horse was in grand fettle
and simply ran big rings around his
field, winning under restraint from
Martinmas in 1:13W.. Dolly Hayman
did not have clear sailing until the last
eighth of a mile, and then disposed of
Misty's Pride for show honors. Arabo
resigned from the service after a short
spell on the firing line.
A review of the racing will illustrate
the fact that the favorites showed to
poor advantage, Kenilworth and Ax
minster being the only coin gatherers.

More than half of the trials yesterday
extended over one minute, while a num
ber lasted two minutes. Of the grey
hounds which remain In Glaucua, Con
roy, Sofala, Texas Betty and Doc Burns
look to have the best chance. The re
sults of yesterday's running with Judge
Thomas Tierney's official scores follow:
The fortunes of coursies will have
a strong bearing on the outcome^of
the open stake to-day at Ingleside
Park. It Is a lottery as to whether the
hares will be strong or weak. If a
greyhound has the speed necessary, to
make his trials short he stands a chance
of working his way down to where the
prizes are worth while. If. however,
he starts in pursuit of a filer his
chances for the stake are settled then
and there.
The annual meeting of the San Fran
cisco Golf Club was held yesterday aft-:
ernoon in the clubhouse adjacent to
the United States military reservation.
The reports of the officers showed that

After a rest of several weeks the
players of the Golden Gate Tennis Club
will again indulge In tournament play.
There will be a handicap doubles event
on the park courts to-day. The Baker
brothers are the holders of â¢ the cups
and will be the most heavily handi
capped team. Other teams that have
won them are R.Whitney and J. Brady.
W. Allen and G. M. Smith. H. Routh
and C. Dunlap, Clinch and McKay and
the Hotchkiss brothers. .
The drawing resulted as follows:
The finals of the handicap doubles
tennis tournament, commenced on
Christmas day, were played yesterday
afternoon on the California Club
courts. The opposing teams were Will
Allen and Dr. H. P. Hill and Herbert
Schmidt and Harry Rolfe. "With odds
of "owe 3-6" the latter team won a
rather tame and uninteresting match.
Both teams played a defensive game.
Rolfe and Schmidt won the first two
sets handily, and should have taken the
third easily. With a lead of 5â 2 they
let up somewhat and became careless.
Allen and Hill took advantage of the
respite and the score soon read 5 â 5.
After this the youngsters found it dif
ficult to get back to their game and
just pulled out, 10â S.
A victroy for Allen and Hill would
have given them a lead for the cups.
They won the first tournament, the
Smith brothers the second and Rolfe
and Schmidt the third. Hereafter Rolfe
and Schmidt will play on the same
mark as Allen and Hill. The score was
6â3, Câ 4, 10â 8.
The New Year's tourney will be com
pleted at the club courts to-day. The
feature will be the finals of the second
class. The contestants will be Herbert
Schmidt and Sidney Salisbury. Schmidt
has been considered a "coming man"
for so many years that many have de
spaired of his ever becoming an expert.
However, the game he put up on Fri
'day and yesterday shows he is of
championship caliber. If he plays up to
form he should beat Salisbury, despite
the fact the latter played a great game
on Friday. It will undoubtedly be a
close and exciting match.
The third class match should prove
equally as good. Alex Beyfuss and
Herbert Long fought it out several
times while at Lowell High School.
Beyfuss always beat his opponent, but
the latter has put in more time prac
ticing and has improved rapidly. Bey
fuss is a strong finisher. This match
will be played at 1 p. m.
The fourth class will be completed in
the morning. In the upper half Doug
lass Grant and Will Volkmann will
meet in the semi-finals. In the lower
half Alden AmeS will play the winner
of the Dr. Lovegrove-Glenn Cogwill
match.

NATIVE, SONS.
The annual- Christmas party given
by Stanford Parlor of the Native Sons
in it3 hall on the last Thursday In
December was one of the most enjoy
able affairs of the kind this parlor has
ever held. There was an immense
tree, profusely decorated, and Walter
H. Marston. a newly Initiated member,
assumed the part of Santa Claus In a
manner that was most acceptable and
showed that he was no novice in the
art of distributing gifts to those who
were entitled to them. There was a
present for each member, all, of
course, of the "Josh" order, but cal
culated to raise a laugh as each re
cipient opened his parcel. The dis
tribution was followed by an excellent
luncheon, songs and stories.

tertainment of the adults and the dis
tribution of pretty presents by Santa

The project of transferring the fran
chise of the Sacramento club to Ta-I
coma was then discussed. After hear- j
ing all the plans of Fisher the mag
nates voted to make the change. This!
means the Capital City will have no;
more big league baseball and that Ta- â¢
coma will become a member of the}
Pacific Coast League, with Mike Fisher !
as owner and manager of the team. j
It has been rumored for Â»ome time j
that the change would be made and the j
magnates had all but made up their:
minds to see the new deal through be
fore the meeting was called. Fisher
claims he lost money at Sacramento
last season and that he saw a good
opening in Tacoma and decided to
make the change should the other mag
nates be willing. /
There is a lot of business before the
league at the present time and it is :
very probable several other meetings '
will be held before everything has been Â¦
formally settled. The advisability of
entering the national agreement will
probably be discussed and the outcome
will be watched with interest all over
the country.
The election of officers was first pro
ceeded with. James F. Moran, the vet
eran baseball representative, who has
acted in that capacity for so many
years, requested that his name be with
drawn, as he felt the duties were too
much for him, and also that a recent
death in his family compelled him to
seek seclusion.
The magnates heard this news with
regret. The name of Eugene F. Bert,
former vice president of the league,
was placed before the meeting and he
was chosen to succeed Moran. The
following officers were also chosen:
Vice president, L. C. Cohen of Seattle;
secretary, James Anderson of San
Francisco; treasurer, Theodore F.
Goodman of San Francisco; directors,
James Moriey of Los Angeles, Henry
Harris of San Francisco, C. F. Sweigert
of Portland, J. Cal Ewlng of Oakland
and L. C. Cohen of Seattle.
Representatives from each city in
the league were on hand. Henry Har
ris and Theodore Goodman looked after
San Francisco's interests at the meet
ing. Mike Fisher represented Sacra
mento and Tacoma. J. Cal Ewing was
there for Oakland. James F. Morley
appeared for Los Angeles. Parke Wil
son and L. C. Cohen represented Seat
tle and Fred Ely and C. F. Sweigert
looked after Portland's interests. Sec
retary James Anderson and Eugene F.
Bert were' also among those on hand.
The first meeting of the baseball
magnates of the Pacific Coast Baseball
League was held last evening in the
offices of Eugene Bert on California
street. After a brief discussion, it was
unanimously agreed that the franchise
of the Sacramento club be transferred
to Tacoma. Officers were chosen for
the ensuing year and the magnates
then adjourned to meet again this aft
ernoon at 1 o'clock.

with a big cargo and nearly 200 pas

With the assistance of confederates
a=hore or the he!:Â» of some civilian f<?l
low ras^enffer. C E. Hobbs, one of
thirty United States marines who left
Seattle for this nort on the steamship
1'matilla. deserted during the vessels
stay At Victoria. The marines had been
on duty at Bremerton. T.'ncle Sam has
plenty of work at present for this arm
of his fijrhling forces, and the utmost
care was taken at Victoria to prevent
any shrinkage at the foreign port of
the Bremerton detachment. Four armed
puards were stationed at the gangplank
and other sentries natroled the deck on
the shore Â«ide. In* spite of these pre
cautions, however. Hobbs walked
ashore clad in civilian parb, which he
obtained from nobody knows where.
The deserter was formerly In the Cana
dian mounted police. His absence was
discovered the following day, when
Purser Sargent tried to find an owner
for the can and white ploves the run
away marine had left behind him. One
of the guards remembers having seen
a passenger bearing a close resem
blance to Hobbs walk ashore, but on
account of his civilian clothes thought
the likeness only a coincidence until
Hobbs failed to answer to his name at
roll call.

"POINTING."
In pursuance of its policy of furnishing its readers not. only all the
features tnat its contemporaries contain, but something more, The Call,
ever on the alert, has secured a series of art pictures of sporting and hunt-
ing scenes and will reproduce them as supplements of its Sunday Edition.
"Pointing" is from the brush of Osthaus, the justly famed painter
of sporting scenes, and this picture is a. most faithful portrayal of an
ideal pointer.
This subject had for its model the famous "Oddsides," a prize-winner
in over fifty bench shows in England and America.
rf The experts who have seen it, and dog fanciers are indeed critical,
pronounce "POINTING" to be a gem. Senter tersely describes "Oddsides"
. as one of the most strikingly beautiful dogs ever shown in this country, of
orange and white, having a beautifully shaped, strong, rugged, masculine
head, long, clear neck, deep chest and powerful back; loin and quarters
perfect, and legs and feet that were simply models.
The study in oil brings out every detail of a field scene with a good
dog pointing. ,
The open field and the exquisite coloring of the principal object make
this a picture that possesses merit of a high degree.

Police Officer Joseph Feld, who is un
der arrest on a charge of murdering his
father-in-law and who Is being sued
for divorce by Alice- Feld,, will have to
pay her alimony. Judge Sloss has made
an order allowing her $25 a month.
Judge Sloss* also madft'an- order al
lowing T. Maybelle Dum $50 a month
alimony and $50 counsel fees. She Is
suing George Dum for divorce. It is a
contested case.
Charlotte M. Kavanjvgh, who in a
cross-complaint for divorce filed by Po
lice Officer James H. Kavanagh to her
suit for divorce is accused of being a
cruel wife, has petitioned for an order
compelling her husband to supply her
counsel fees. N
The young couple reached Berlin in
proper time and Rosenberg commenced
his musical studies. On the 1st of Sep
tember he received the promised $50
from Mrs. Goldberg, and again on Octo
ber 1 he received a check for a similar
amount from her. That was all he did
receive, he now complains, and he al
leges that because of Mrs. Goldberg's
failure to provide him with means he
was compelled to stoop to all sorts of
work to earn sustenance for himself
and wife and to pay the cost of his
musical- education.
He took his wffe to her parents' home
in Warsaw and left her there, and re
turned to this country. He told his
parents of his marriage, and they im
mediately filed a suit to have it an
nulled on the ground that as at the
time it was performed their son was a
minor and had not obtained their con
sent it was not binding. The suit was
bitterly fought by the young wife, but
the young musician proved his case
and was by Judge Seawell restored to
the status of a single person.
M. Rosenberg, a young musician of
some" local fame and who recently ac
quired notoriety by reason of his suc
cessful appeal to the courts to have his
marriage to Bertha Rotenberg an
nulled, is again to the fore with a suit.
Now he wants damages in the sum of
551,300 from Emily Goldberg, who he
claims is responsible for his unhappy
matrimonial experience and consequent
mental suffering. He filed the suit yes
terday.
In his complaint young Rosenberg
alleges that he never would have
thought of taking unto himself a wife
but for Mrs. Goldberg. He says that
when he was but little more than 19
years of age she promised him that in
the event of his marriage to Miss Ro
tenberg, her niece, she would send him
to Europe to complete his musical edu
cation; would, once he was married,
pay him $50 a month for a period of
seven yt^rs and would make him her
heir. She is a woman of means, says
the plaintiff, and he placed so much
reliance on her word that he agreed to
become a benedict and make Miss Ro
tenberg his wife. The marriage took
place at San Jose. August 21, 1900, and
the next day Rosenberg and his young
wife started for Germany. Mrs. Gold
berg supplied the means to pay their
passage, and also gave him a $100 bill
to defray the cost of incidentals on the
trip.
As was published yesterday, Mrs.
Colt's departure for the East was
secretly arranged. She even took the
precaution to conceal her plans from
her most intimate friends and even
the attaches of the Palace were not
certain yesterday that she had left this
city. Early in. the day a detective
called at Mrs. Colt's apartments, where
a maid had been left in charge, and
was informed by the latter that her
mistress was still too ill to see any one.'
The detective, however, insisted that
he was there to confirm the report
that Mrs. Coit had left the city and
finally the maid admitted that her mis
tress was not in. Later this maid sud
denly departed and then It became
known that Mrs. Coit was awaiting her
at Reno.
In preparing to leave the city Mrs.
Coit was careful to conceal her des
tination by buying a local ticket to
Reno. Her maid was instructed to
purchase through tickets and follow
h,er mistress eastward, which she did
yesterday. Â¦ Â¦ .
Assistant District Attorney Ferral
objected to so long a continuance, as It
was of the utmost importance that the
case be set for trial as speedily as pos
sible so as to get the witnesses within
the jurisdiction of the court. The Judge
finally continued the case until to-mor
row, when it is expected an attorney
will be appointed by the Judge to rep
resent the defendant during the ar
raignment.
â¢ In speaking of Mrs. Hitchcock-Coit'e
disappearance. District Attorney By
ington said:
"She testified in the Police Court
arid signed the recognizance, thereby
binding herself in $500 bonds to ap
pear as a witness at the trial in the
Superior Court. Of course, that is only
a personal bond. We were led to be
lieve implicitly that she .would be
present at the trial and if she is on
her way to Paris I cannot understand
why she should be guilty of such an
act of deception. We could not, of
course, bring her back unless we could
charge her with some crime. That is
a matter for after consideration. Her
evidence given at the preliminary ex
amination in the Police Court can, of
course, be read at the trial, but we
want her here if possible."
CONCEALS HER PLANS.
CASE IS CONTINUED.
The question that worries the District
Attorney and police is her ultimate des
tination. If she is on her way to Paris
there can be no hope of her appearing
as a witness at the trial of Alexander
K. Gornett, charged with the murder of
Major J. W. McClung in her apartments
at the Talace Hotel. There is a glim
mer of hope entertained by the District
Attorney that as she has some prop
erty interests in the Southern States
she may go there, with the intention
of returning in time for the trial.
Garnett's case was called in Judge
Lawlor's court yesterday for the ar
raignment o'f the defendant. He was
not represented by counsel, and he
asked the Judge to postpone his ar
raignment for one week, as he expected
an attorney from the East to look after
his interests' at the trial.
The disappearance of Mrs. Lillian
Hitchcock-Coit, as told exclusively in
yesterday's Call, caused consternation
in the District Attorney's oftlce and in
l-olict; circles. District Attorney Byingr
tcn consulted with Captain Martin, who
ck-tailcd Detective Rvan to make an in
vestigation. Ryan soon discovered that
Mrs. Coit had left on Friday morning's
overland train for New York.

SUPERFLUOUS HAIR
28-29. with the electric needle without pain w
scar; permanency guaranteÂ»U;hours 1 to 4 p.m-The truest homes are often in
houses not especially well kept, where
the comfort and happiness of the in
mates, rather than extreme tidiness
and the preservation of the furniture,
are first consulted. The object, of the
home is to be the center, the pivot on
which the family life turns. The first
requisite is to make it so attractive
that none of its members shall care
to linger long outside its limits. All
legitimate means should be employed
to this end and no effort spared that
cÂ«n contribute to this purpose. There
are many houses called homes, kept
with such waxy neatness by pains
taking, anxious women, that are so
oppressive In their nicety as to ex
cludo all home feeling: from their
spotless precincts. The very name of
home is synonymous with personal
freedom and relaxation trom care;
solid comfort.
But neither of these can be felt
where such a mania for external
cleanliness pervades the household as
to render everything subservient
thereto. Many housewives, if they
see a speck on the floor or wall, or a
bit of thread or paper on the floor,
rush at it as 1 if' It were the seed of
pestilence, which must be removed on
the" instant. Their temper depends
upon their maintenance of N perfect
purity and order. If there be any
failure on their part or any combina
tion of circumstances against them
they fall into a pathetic despair and
can hardly be lifted out. They do not
see that cheerfulness is more needed
at home than all the spotlessness that
ever shone. Neatness is one thing and
a state of perpetual housecleaning quite
another.
Out of this grows by degrees the
feeling that certain things and apart
ments are too Erood for daily use.
Hence chairs and sofas are covered
and rooms shut up, save for special
occasions, when they are permitted to
reveal their violated sacredness In a

FLOW OF CALIFORNIA RIVERS
Home Is not a name, nor a form,
nor a routine. It is a spirit, a pres
ence, a principle. Material and meth
od will not and cannot make it. It
must get its light and sweetness from
those who inhabit it, from flowers and
sunshine, from the sympathetic na
tures which, in their exercise of sym
pathy, can lay aside the tyranny of
the broom and the awful duty of end
less scrubbing.
manner that mars every pretense of
hospitality. Nothing should be
bought which is considered too fine
for the fullest domestic appropria
tion. Far better is the plainest fur
niture, on which the children can
climb, than satin and damask, which
must be viewed with reverence.
When anything is reserved or se
cluded Â¦ to disguise the fact is ex
tremely difficult. A chilly air wraps
it round and the repulsion of strange
ness is experienced by the most insen
sible.
Charles Landau, a saloon-keeper on
Pacific street, lost some of his "glad
rags" on the opening night of the new
year. Policeman Joy found Al Des
teral coming from Landau's room with
a sunset shirt, a waistcoat that looked
like an explosion in a paint shop and
a pair of trousers that added another
hue unto the rainbow. Before Judge
John Collins is a man with a wooden
leg-, who makes his condition a means
of getting a livelihood by begging. ' In
addition to the "bum pin" Collins pos
sesses a terrible temper. When he
accosts a passerby and is refused alms
he clings to him like a pup to a bone
and uses expressions that are entirely
barred in clubdom. To-morrow Judge
Mogan will send him to the County
Jail, where they will take his wooden
leg away from him when he attempts
rough work.
Henry Rice, however, was so over
come with the fighting spirit that he
used a tin horn in one hand and a
balloon in the other.. That was where
the fun stopped.^ He walked up to
Policeman Wheltoh on the corner of
Market and Powell streets and forgot
what hand he was dealing out. He
hit the policeman on . the nose with
a tin horn and was promptly dragged
to the gutter, bundled into a patrol
wagon and sent to jail. It was rather
fortunate that he did not make his
mistake with some of the laughing
women on Market street or he might
have decorated an electric light pole.
Judge Mogan, who likes fun but
abhors "strong arm" work, took the
case under advisement. On Monday
he will deliver his opinion as to
whether it was really meant for a
right hand or a left hand blow.
Only one case of battery as a re
sult of the New Year carnival appear
ed in the Police courts. Legally there
must have been about eighteen mil
lion in a small way, because a shoe
firm got out a new device which look
ed formidable, but was really so
harmless that the roisterers on the
street did not hesitate to slap the
face of every pretty woman they met
with it.
Ah I>e is a Chinese' cigar merchant,
and his ways are peculiar but not
vain. He hired two little boys of Ital
ian origin, who were witnesses against
him on the charge of receiving stolen
property. They told Judge Mogan yes
terday that Ah Lee had induced them
to steal a large quantity of twine from
the Van Laak Manufacturing Com
pany, on Mission street. The China
man claims to be a graduate of Yale
and speaks excellent English. Judge
Mogan held him to appear before the
Superior Court in bail of $1000 on the
charge of receiving stolen property.
Thomas Lanigan tried to help a
friend out Saturday night and fell into
the path of trouble. friend had
dined at a restaurant at 1205 Stockton
street. The napkin had a stain on it,
and the friend made a rough house.
Subsequently he found Lanigan and
tcld htm his troubles. Gallant Lanigan
went to the restaurant to make a Rus
sian settlement of the difficulty. He
was met by Ben Widrom, a waiter, and
received certain attentions from him in
the way of being battered on the head
with a disused chair leg.
Widrom, the waiter, was before Judge
Cabaniss yesterday and the case was
fully discussed. It was finally contin
ued until to-morrow, when a dismissal
probably will be ordered.
Every attempt on the part of the de-,
fense was met with a parry, and in the
end Miss Naylor. was held in $1000 bonds
to appear before the Superior Court.
Nels Larsen is one of the most posi
tive witnesses that ever made a turn in
the road. He has been prosecuting
Agnes Naylor in Judge Cabaniss' court
on the charge of attempted robbery.
In addition he charged Frank West
with the.same crime. West proved an
alibi, which Sammy "Weller suggested
as the best means for defense to Mr.
Pickwick.
Three witnesses were ordered into
custody by Judge Mogan yesterday in
connection with the stabbing Friday
night at the Sailor's Home, when
Thomas Turner attempted to cut the
spareribs out of a fellow boarder. The
court received word that . the victim
would probably not survive his in
juries. The witnesses were sailors and
the paths of the seas are wide, so as
a matter of protection to justice the
men who saw the occurrence were
held securely, in order that a murder
charge may' not lack evidence.
Hugo. Schlam was dismissed on the
charge of felony embezzlement by
Judge Mogan yesterday. Originally
he was arrested on the complaint of
School Director Roncovleri. The
School Director claimed that in a mo
ment of melody he had indited cer
tain strenuous measures in the way
of a march, which he entitled "Pro
Patria." The result of his efforts put
Wagner in the 2:36 class.
After he had evolved this last pro
duction he claims he turned the score
over to Schlam for transposition.
Schlam, he said, held out the tuneful
melody and claimed it for his own.
There was ample testimony before the
court that the defendant had aided in
the wonderful' production, which was
valued at 5250. This should bar the
common expression that something
"sold for a songr."
Judge Mogan ordered his bailiff to
make a careful search of the court
room for a piano in order to deter
mine with his trained ear whether the
march was Italian or German, but
they failed to find one. . Bailiff Hick
ey even went so far as to examine the
vest pockets of a "hop fiend" in his
quest for the desired instrument.
There could be no determination
made of the question of ownership in
a police court, so the court wearily
advised the complainant to search for
a remedy in the civil courts. In the
meantime he ordered that the forty
eight sheets of exquisite and stirring
music be held in the possession of the
property clerk until a determination
was made. Property Clerk Bill Din
an may take up the study of music
on the strength of his new posses
sion.
Fritz yesterday Desteral told that he
was formerly a soldier and had passed
almost all of his enlistment as a
prisoner on Alcatraz Island. He was
charged with burglary and given one
week to secure counsel and prepare hi3
defense. .

"Christmas will be celebrated In Rus
sia on Thursday next, the 25th of De
cember falling in that country on the
7th of January. Russia is thirteen days
behind such countries as America and
England as regards the calendar and
a few centuries behind as regards civil
ization.
"Some years ago Russia introduced a
national institution under the name of
'progron,' a word which implies a de
sire to destroy like a thunder storm.
The obiect of the 'progron' is to ter
rorize the Jews. Dramatically consid
ered, a perfect 'progron' Is a tragedy in
five acts. Anti-Semitic propaganda,
some incidents as a pretext, boys
throwing stones as a feeler, and then
the mob passing from breaking furni
ture to murder and violence. The Eas
ter horrors of the Kishenev programme
in April last have thrilled the civilized
world. The old damnable He that the
Jews had murdered for ritual purposes
furnished the pretext for 'shedding the
blood of war In peace/
''It was chiefly Jewish industry and
intelligence that made Kishenev pros
perous, and now that the Jews have
built up the place Russian justice seeks
to get rid of them. Hampered as they
are by cruel laws, feeling themselves
to be objects of direst hatred for re
ligious and social and economic rea
sons, without a friendly hand to pro
tect'them, with the bitter memory of
'their terrible experience during the last
'progron/ the Jews in Kishenev are
naturally stricken at the approach of
Christmas, notwithstanding that this
season is supposed to bring a message
of 'peace and good will/
"It is possible that the threatening
danger will be averted by the timely
expression of American sentiment
reaching .the conscience of the Czar.
But a solemn duty devolves especially
upon the Anglo-Saxon portion of Chris
tendom to petition the Czar and the
Pope to educate their respective adher
ents not to give credence to the outrag
eous calumny that the Jews require hu
man blood for ritual purposes. They
will thus lessen the chances of vile fa
natics bringing disgrace upon Christ
tlanity by 'shedding the blood of war
In peace/ " ' t
"Christmas in Kishenev" was the
subject of a sermon delivered yester
day in the Bush-street Synagogue by
Rabbi Isidore Myers. The rabbi took
for his text the words of King David,
"And he shed the blood of war in
peace" (I Kings xi:5). In part he said:

"The upper Kern basin differs from
the other large canyons of the Sierra
Nevada Mountains in its meridian
trend and its remarkably straight
course. This canyon dissects a high
valley which has an area of about 100
square miles, and it is situated at an
average altitude of 2500 feet above the
bottom of the canyon. This high valley
was evolved at a time when the Sierra
Nevadas were much lower than now.
About 2500 feet above this high valley
Is still another high valley, which rep
'resents an earlier stage in the evolution
of the mountains, when the Sierra Ne
vadas were not more than 3000 feet
above sea level at . the highest point.
The remnants of this old mountain sur
face are still found in the summits' of
Mount Whitney and Sheep and Table
mountains, at an altitude of 4000 feet
or more.
DEVELOPMENT OF MOUNTAINS.
"In the recognition of these high val
leys we have a record of the develop
ment of the Sierra Nevada Mountains
by uplift and dissection in very distinct
stages. Since the Sierra Nevadas re
ceived their present general inflgura
tlon they have been glaciated. The
glaciation has very materially modified
the geomorphic characters of the moun
tains, partly in the direction of reduc
ing the crests by the sapping of glacial
cirques. These cirques are great am-
BERKELEY, Jan. 2.â Three Interest
ing papers were read to-day at the sec
ond session of the Cordilleran section
of the Geological Society of America,
meeting annually for the fifth time. The
papers described certain areas of the
earth whose phenomena present mate
rial for absorbing geological study.
That by Professor Andrew C. Lawson
of the University of California on "The
Geomorpnogeny of the Upper Kern
Basin" was, of course, interesting lo
cally, but the papers of Professor W.
G. Tight, president of the University
of New Mexico, on the glaciation in
South America, and R. S. H,olway on
the' cold air currents of the Pacific
Coast were no less engaging.
In describing the upper Kern basin
Professor Lawson used illustrations
and maps to assist the auditors in com
prehending more readily the features
of that wonderful region. In part he
said:
Members From All Over Central
California Will Take Part in
Convention.
The Salvation Army of this city will
hold its midwinter congress here from
January 6 to the 8th. Salvation Army
workers from all over Central Califor
nia will participate. The purposes of
the congress, which is held semi-an
nually. is to get the various workers
together and talk over the plans for
the work for the comine year.
The new Central building on Mission
street is to be dedicated as a "Consul
Booth-Tucker memorial" in honor of
the great work done by the late Mrs.
Booth-Tucker among women. The
building is to be used for the provin
cial headquarters for the entire coast
and also as a Women's Training Col
lege for evangelical work. A boarding
house for the young women of the
army who work in the daytime In
stores and offices will also be connected
with the new building:.
F. ,M. Anderson of the geological de
partment of the Southern Pacific Rail
road was elected president of the so
ciety. ;
Mr. Holway's paper was technically
descriptive of the Pacific air currents,
dealing particularly with those of that
coast of the United States.
The paper of Professor Tight was de
voted to a description of the hitherto
unstudied region of the Bolivian Andes
of- South America. The chief results of
a cursory examination by Dr. Tight
show that three distinct periods of gla
ciation are to be found In these moun
tains. These periods of glaciation are
separated by periods of deglaclation
and erosion. He also recognized an im
mense extinct lake, perhaps the largest
lake anywhere in the world, which was
co-existent with the time of maximum
glaciation. This lake is 500 or 600 miles
long, and its abandoned shore lines are
beautifully marked in terraces on the
banks of the mountain surrounding the
plateau. There have evidently, Dr.
Tight said, been very widespread and
very important climatic changes in that
region in recent time.
"The study of this upper Kern basin
affords us a basis for the subdivision of
quaternary time and also enlarges our
ideas of the length of that division of
the geological time scale. A minor fea
ture of the region Is the existence of
very well preserved volcanoes of recent
date in some of the high valleys de
scribed."
RECENT VOLCANOES.
"The high Sierras in the vicinity of
the upper Kern basin present perhaps
the finest Illustration of this process of
mountain reduction to be found any
where. The peculiarly straight charac
ter of the upper Kern Canyon finds its
explanation in the fact that It follows a
line of rifting In the earth's crust. Such
rift valleys are rare, the best illustra
tions being the valley of the Dead Sea
in Palestine and the prolongation of
that valley through the lake region of
Africa, as described by J. W. Gregory.
phitheaters which have been eaten into
the hearta of the mountains, and where
these amphitheaters encroach upon one
another the intersection of their walls
has the effect of greatly reducing or
obliterating the higher crests of the
mountains.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 2. â Congressman
Victor H. Metcalf has forwarded to
City Clerk James W. Glllogly copies of
the communications that passed be
tween himself. Colonel W. H. Heuer, in
charge of the improvement work on
Oakland harbor 1 , and General G. L.
Gillesple, chief of engineers of the
United States army, with reference. to
the request that Alameda be permitted
to utilize a narrow strip of land on the
south side of the tidal canal as part
of a water park and also with respect
to the petition from private parties
asking f o be allowed to construct a
wharf In the big ditch near Park street.
Mr. Metcalf states that he sees no
prospect at present of any person or
company securing permission to build
a landing in the canal. He is of the
opinion, however, that the Government
will be willing to allow the city to make
use of the strip of land as part of a
park site, but that it will not convey \
the reality to the municipality.
Major Heuer in his report to Gen
eral Gillisple says In part:
"The tidal canal was not construct
ed for navigation or commercial pur
poses, but solely with a view. to carry
ing water from San Leandro Bay to
Oakland harbor for flushing and main
taining depths in the latter. Three
drawbridges were placed across the
canal in order to permit dredges to pass
through in case redredging of the canal
should become necessary. Hence, un
less and until Congress decides that
the tidal canal may be used for navi
gation and commercial purposes and
provides funds for the operation and
maintenance of the same, I believe it
would be injudicious to grant any per
mits for the establishment of any
wharves or landing places within the
canal. If permission be granted to the
City of Alameda to erect even a small
wharf or landing place In said canal
it might be claimed that this was a
recognition on the part of the Gov
ernment that the tidal canal was a pub
lic waterway, and applications for
wharf or landing place in said canal
thereafter be consistently refused. I
see no objection to authorizing the
City of Alameda to plant trees and
shrubs along the very narrow strip of
land adjacent to the canal, provided
the Government does not relinquish Its
control or ownership of said strip. Many
applications are now on file at this of
fice for positions as bridge tenders on
the various bridges across the tidal
canal. If it became necessary to oper
ate and maintain these bridges it is es
timated that the annual expense to the
Government would exceed $20,000, and
this expense would have to be Incurred
If the canal were declared a public nav
l igable waterway.

A runaway horse dashed Into one of
the carriages of a funeral prucesslon at
Thirteenth and "Washington streets thi3
afternoon, endangering the lives of sev
eral persons and demolishing the buggy
to which it was harnessed. The car
riage was not- damaged and after a
short delay the driver proceeded on his
way to the cemetery.
The funeral was that of James FujoL
and the hearse and carriages had 'Just
left Albert Brown's undertaking par
lors, where the services were held. As
the procession reached the corner of
Thirteenth and Washington streets, the
frightened horse, hitched to a light
buggy, turned the corner of Broadway
and came tearing toward the line of
carriages. All turned safely out of the
runaway's path except the last, the
driver of which was unable to turn
his team In time to escape, and the
front wheel of the buggy struck tho
hub of the rear wheel. The shock over
turned the buggy and the horse freed
himself from the wreck and ran on.
Beyond a few scratches the back was
not damaged.
The runaway Is owned toy Dr. 31. M.

On November 17 the Morgan house
was ransacked by burglars while the
family was absent and many valuable
things taken. The excitement attend
ing this episode and the talk of the fam
ily had its effect on the boy's already
weakened mind and a week later he
reported {hat he had encountered a
burglar in the upstairs hallway while
the house was full of people. The next
day the boy repbrted another burglar,
who had, he said, come into the house
while the family was at dinner.
Marshal Kerns investigated the Mor
gan premises, but could find no trace
of a burglar's ingress or egress. The
boy said he saw a burglar climbing
up the front porch at his second visit,
but this was shown to "have been an
impossibility. It was then that the
condition of the boy's mind was no
ticed and physicians summoned to at
tend him.
There was some doubt for awhile
among the physicians as to whether
the boy really died from a brain affec
tion or from ptomaine poison through
eating the leaves of a passion vine three
weeks ago. It was found, however, that
the passion vine leaves had not affect
ed the boy's health. '.'â¢". 'Â¦Â¦'-
The Morgan family has been pur
sued by a hard fate during the last
year. About nine months ago Eddie
Morgan, aged 8 years, fell from a local
train upon his head, the injury result
ing: In almost complete loss of eyesight.
The father of the boy. who is now su
ing the Southern Pacific Company for
$20,000 for the injury to the child, is
himself an invalid. These accidents,
coupled with the death of Robert and
the robbery of their home, make a sad
chapter of misfortunes.
The funeral of tha boy will be held
from his late residence at 2 o'clock to
morrow afternoon. r -'\:;:
The boy received the fatal blow on
the head while playing with, some com
panions. For awhile afterwards he act*
ed rationally, but in a month or more
began to show symptoms of failing eye
sight. The physicians who were called
attributed this affection to the blow
the lad had received, the brain being
injured. He complained of pains in
the head often and suffered severe
headaches.
A blow from a baseball bat received
five months ago brought death to-day
to Robert Archibald Morgan, aged It
years, the son of Mr. and Mrs. George
W. Morgan of 2330 College avenue. He
was the boy who, a month ago, twice
encountered a burglar In his home, a
burglar that now. In view of the man
ner of the boy's death, the doctors be
lieve was only the vagary of a diseased
mind.

LOS ANGELES. Jan. 2-â A. E. Hurst,
a wealthy citizen of Wtiittler. was the
victim this afternoon of one of the
boldest daylight robberies that has ever
been committed in this section of the
Jltate. In the crowded corridor of the
Security Savings Bank, at Second and
Main streets, he was robbed of $2140
which had jUFt been handed to him by
the paying teller. He did not get out
of the building before a professional
pickpocket had secured the money and
made his escape.
Hurst drew the money in order to
make a final payment on a piece of
property which he had purchased, and
when he presented his check at the
bank there was gome slight delay about
cashing it. and during the short wait a
number of persons, supposedly custom
ers of the bank, crowded around him.
The money was paid over and Hurst
left the window. He had not walked
a dozen feet before two well dressed
men Jostled him in the crowd. They
Â»t once offered profuse apologies and
left him hurriedly. As soon as Hurst
reached the sidewalk he felt for his
money, but It was gone. He at
<ince returned to the bank and re
ported the robbery, but the two men
who had Jostled against him had
disappeared.
It is supposed that they got his
money. Several persons who were In
the crowd reported having seen one
man quickly pass a roll of bills to
another man and then leave the build
ing.
That there is a gang of profes
sional pickpockets in this city is
now known. Yesterday's tournament
nf roses netted this gang several
thousand dollars In money and dia
monds. To-day seven additional
robberies were reported to the police
by victims of their operations in Pasa
dena and on the crowded cars going
to that city.

the legal delays incident to incorpora

The Bacon Society is collecting a
valuable library of Bacon literature,
records of all of Bacon's manuscripts,
dates of publication, charts -showing
the doings of men known to have been
associated with Bacon, and a list of lir
braries, institutions and houses where^
It is possible valuable documents may
be found. One piece of work which
will tako years of patient effort' will
probably be begun in a short while â
an -extended compilation" of coinci
dences in the vocabularies of Bacon
and Shakespeare.
2 SUNDAY FOREIGN 2
A representative of the society said
yesterday: "It is of paramount Im
portance at this juncture that every
statement made in the pamphlets or
lectures be undeniably authenticated.
Nothing will tend Inspire greater
confidence in our work than an un
broken record for truth and modera.
tion in every statement which ema
nates from or is recognized by the so
ciety. If the impression can be estab
lished that the members are a band
of seekers after truth, desirous of
being corrected when in error, but
determined, at all cost, to arrive at
a definite solution of the problem, and
not a coterie of enthusiasts bent on
having a theory accepted, regardless
of the difficulties which surround it,
the suggested propaganda will meet
with a sympathetic hearing."
COLLECTING BACON MATTER.
LONDON. Jan. 2. â Let William
Shakespeare tremble in his grave
before the altar of the beautiful
old church in Stratford-on-Avon! No
more wjll flocking Americans en
rich 1 the town of his birth by their
pilgrimages; and no more will they
travel over to Shottery and make eyes
at the two pretty girls who have in
their veins the same blood as Anne
Hathaway, and who now show visitors
over the picturesque cottage in which
the alleged bard's sweetheart lived!
Or, at any rate, if the actor-manager
who somehow got the credit for writ
ing the mighty Bacon's plays is not
shorn of his borrowed glory instantly,
it will be only because the newly in
corporated Bacon Society of London
has been unexpectedly hampered by
facts or by lack of facts.
I find, from interviews with various
members of this organization, that
plans are now in preparation for a
concerted Anglo-American attack on
Shakespeare that will be of greater
force and effectiveness than anything
conceived by Ignatius Donnelly or
even Mrs. Gallup. Armed with cipher
indications that Bacon wrote Shake
speare; with circumstantial evidence
from the life and acknowledged writ
ings of Bacon, and from what little is
known of the life of Shakespeare, the
society is now raising- capital in' Lon
don to pay for a minute search in
libraries, institutions and private
houses where, it is possible further
documents may ; be found throwing
direct light on Bacon's side of the
case. Lord Verulam of the family of
Grimston and the present holder of
Lord Bacon's baronial title, has at
last consented to allow Gorhambury,
Bacon's seat near St. Albans, to be
searched. The Bacon Society firmly
believes that the data "exists which
will prove finally that Shakespeare's
fame has been one of grand chimera.
GREAT SCHOLAR ENGAGED.
The second scheme is the presenta
tion of the beliefs of the Bacon So
ciety to the world, with the facts on
which these beliefs rest. The plans
for propaganda are enterprising. The
society' has taken permanent" rooms
near the British Museum, and Curator
Emlle Weiderlich. distinguished as a
Bacon scholar, has been* secured to
give all his time to the work. The
society considers that until now the
world has never had an opportunity
of, hearing the Baconian argument
properly presented.
To the end that it may now hear,
a band of lecturers on Shakespeare-
Bacon questions is being obtained. All
lectures are to be submitted to the
Bacon Society before engagements are
made, in order that there be no in
accuracies or repetitions. Each mem
ber of the Bacon f Society has been
written to with a view to enlisting
active personal co-operation. The
names and addresses of sympathizers
with the aÂ«ms of the society are being
secured in order to increase the mem
bership. Until now its ranks have been
composed of the scholarly few whose
personal inclinations have drawn them
together. Steps will be taken to bring
the objects of the society before liter
ary and educational institutions
throughout the world. It 1Â« probable
that hereafter a series of Bacon So
ciety pamphlets, one each month, will
be published on the authorship of the
Shakespeare plays.

STOCK MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. 2. â War news was the chief
topic of conversation before the session opened
and when the bell rang for the opening of
business there was a rush of buying orders In
the wheat pit. No sellers were to be found.
howe\>er. As a result, initial sales showed a
range of an even 2c on May wheat, the price
being MÂ»iÂ«^f>6 8 4C which was an advance of
y t c to 2i 4 c over Thursday's close. Shorts were
active buyers and the price rose rapidly. At
87%c there was considerable liquidation and
the price settled back to 87c. The demand con
tinued gocd at all times, however, and the
market rallied on all small recessions. The
feature of trading was a lack of offerings. On
account of mourning for victims of the Iro
quols fire, the board closed an hour earlier
than is U5ual on Saturday. The shortened ses

87 1 ic a gain of 3c over Thursday's close. The
July option also showed good gains, and after
ranfdng between 8Oc and 82>Â£c, closed with a
gain of 3Q3>^c at 82%682%c.
The corn market was influenced by the
same conditions that governed wheat and
prices showed sharp advances. Shorts covered
freely and there was also a good Investment
demand, while offerings were extremely light.
May opened %c to Y*&%c higher at 45%Â©4Gc

Perk led the provision list in a sensational
advance and at on<Â» time Â¦was 75c higher for
May over the low point of the day. The war
scare and total absence of deliveries on Jan
uary contracts were the Influences that caused
the higher prices. Offerings were light through
out the entire session. Buying by shorts was
the chief factor. May pork closed 57%c high
