YENTAI, Sunday, Sept. 4.â The.Rus-
Bians evacuated their positions around
Liaoyang during the night of Septem
ber 3, crossing the Taitse River and
burning the bridges behind them. In
the meantime a strong force was hold-
Ing General Kuroki b^ck from Yentai.
During the combined attack on Liao
yang, which commenced on August 30,
.with Oku attacking from the southeast
and General Nodzu from the southwest,
the shell fire was terrific, in one in
stance fifty-six shells bursting at the
same tlm?.' The Japanese made a fine
infantry attack. They succeeded in
reaching the Russian trenches, but
were repulsed with heavy loss. The
Japanese shrapnel, as a rule, burst too
high. On the whole the day went well
for the Russians. The Japanese were
driven from th% villages along the rail
road.
On August 31 the shelling commenced
at daylight from all sides, but the Rus
sian infantry pressed forward. Late
that afternoon the news came that
Kuroki was threatening the railroad
at Yentai and the Russians commenced
to retire, enabling the Japanese, to
bring up two batteries and enfilade the
Russian force along the railroad. Dur
ing the night the transport moved into
Liaoyang.
'.;On 'September 1 the Russians' re
treatedfrom their main position, which
â¢formed a; circle around the city, while
the transport crossed the river. At -2
o'clock the Japanese succeeded in. plac
ing two guns iri"position and shelled
the railroad station, resulting in 'many
casualties; At the same time the Japa
nese infantry attacked the inner Rus
sian position, but was repulsed. In the
evening the Japanese brought up heavy
guns and used Shlmose powder to shell
the Russian town. , The Russians held
the position untllthe night of Septem
ber 3, when they retired across the
river.
On September 2 a strong Russian
force was moved east from Yentai to
hold Kuroki back. Kuroki attacked It
and was repulsed, being driven from
his positions on the left. The Japa
nese poured In a terrific shrapnel fire,
one. shell annihilating two Russian
companies. In the evening the Rus
sian artillery, which had been rein
forced, shelled the Japanese position.
Kuroki pushed his right forward and
got within twelve miles of the railroad
at Yentai. Later he -was driven back
to his original position.

ST. PETERSBURG, Sept.. 6, Â»:20 a,
m.â It Is impossible at this hour to ob
tain any statement from the authori
ties regarding the reported prepara
tions for the abandonment of Mukden.
This is the first intimation that such a
course ls'contemplated. If the report be
true it means' the abandonment of the
whole of Southern Manchuria and the
winding up t of the present campaign.
In fact, should Mukden be evacuated
there would be no point for ' wintering
the army of a quarter of a million men,
with its many wounded, short of Har
bin. ' .
On the other hand, the evacuation of
Mukden would give Field Marshal
Oyama commodious winter quarters
and the practical control of two lines
of railway. The .Kinchou-Singmlntin
line, tapping rich Chinese territory,
stops a little short of Mukden, with
which it la connected by a Â¦ good wagdn
road.
The report of the prospective evacu
ation of Mukden, if well founded, would
indicate that the crippling effect of the
Liaoyang 'fighting on Kuropatkin's
army Is more serious than .has yet been
intimated.-

REPORT OF KUROPATKIX.
Tokio was illuminated again to-night

where a' series of lantern processions
took place, Â¦ were thronged.
TOKIO. Sept. 5.â A mass of official
reports on the battle of Liaoyang
reached the imperial headquarters to
day, but they will not be given out
until it is possible to put them in order
and make from them a. connected and
detailed story. In the meantime head
quarters is refraining from giving any
thing to the public.
It . is generally known that General
Kuropatkin succeeded, by means of a
desperate rearguard action and strong
and well handled flank movements.Mn
withdrawing the great 'bulk of the
Russian army and that he cut bridges
to hamper the Japanese pursuit: â¢>.*â¢â¢*'
Critical interest centers in the opera
tions of the Japanese right wing late
Friday night and early Saturday morn
ing. General Kuroki then swung to
the westward, his movement being de
signed to flank the remainder: of the
Russians left at. Liaoyang itself. It is
believed here that General Kuropatkin
is bound to lose many prisoners to the
Japanese. It is possible, however, that
the topographical difficulties and the
overwhelming: opposition of the Rus
sians may check this movement on the
part of General- Kuroki.
Among the Japanese officers reported
killed in the battle of Liaoyang are
Lieutenant Teraouchi, son of Lieuten
ant General Teraouchi, Minister of
War, and Fukushima and
Muratta, both sons of Japanese gen
erals.
Official figures of the Japanese losses
and a list of the trophies captured are
expected to reach Toklo to-morrow.
'It Is believed here that General Kuro
patkin's next stand will be made at
Mukden, although there is defensible
ground south of there.
Field Marshal Yamagata, chief of
the general staff, and Lieutenant Gen
eral Teraouchi were the hosts at a ban
quet given to-night In honor of the
Liaoyang victory. The guests included
the Imperial Princes, the members -of
the Cabinet and the Elder Statesmen,
the staff officers of the army and navy

Toklo Believes Kuropatkin Will Again
Turn Upon His Pursuers.
EXPECTS BATTLE AT 3IUKDEX.
BERLIN, Sept. 5.â Colonel Gaedke,
the war correspondent of the Tage
blatt, writing from Liaoyang under
date of August 9, declared that it was
not the Intention' of General Kuropat
kin to defend Liaoyang to the utter
most, but to retreat to the next' posi
tipn, which was said to be Tieling,
about sixty miles north of Mukden,
which had been strongly fortified.
â¢ "The peculiarity of all these posi
tions â Haiqheng,- Anshanshan, .Liao
yang and Tieling," writes Colonel
Gaedke, "is that naturally they are of
the strongest,, but very weak when
fortified and an army sits down, pas
sively within them.";
. Colonel Gaedke says it is . possible
that- the Russians - may retreat even
further than Tieling. He writes -in
the bitterest terms of Viceroy "Alex
left,* He says that the arrival of the
Imperatively needed troops had been
suspended for three weeks, by which
General Kuropatkin had been de
prived of at least 75,000 men, which
might turn the scale in his favor.

BLAMES VICEROY ALEXIEFF.
The Times believes it is Impossible
that "the heroic rear guard," which
defended Liaoyang, "has -had, time to
rejoin 'Kuropatkin, whose long' and
dangerous ; retreat" It believes to be
seriously menaced.
- The military critic of the Times be-v
Heves' that Kuropatkin' must* sacrifice
his rear- guard if be hopes to get the
"Once across this serious obstacle,
the Russian forces will be In sufficient
safety, though the passage of the river
may be made a'terribly expensive oper
ation," It says. "If the Russian army
gets to Mukden in any â¢ considerable
force, Japan will have reached the
limit of her advantages and,, although
we are convinced that she will main
tain what she has conquered,; she will
have to face the utmost test ' In a de
fensive struggle before the truce of ex
haustion is . forced upon the combat
ants."
The Daily Telegraph, after declaring
that Kuropatkin's operations and the
defense of Port Arthur "stand out as
two fine achievements, which have done
the most to maintain the prestige of
Russian arms throughout a campaign
which otherwise has formed a story of
unfathomable incompetence and unin
terrupted disaster," adds that the
critical moment of the retreat is likely
to be reached only when General Kuro
patkin arrives at the Hun River, some
miles south of Mukden.
LAST BAR TO SAFETY.
"If Kuropatkin ' can" move his army
over the thirty -miles that separate
Yentai and Mukden," Wilkinson says,
"he will- break the record for such
performances. The Japanese columns
will have little difficulty in coming up
with his rear guard arid" engaging it
whenever they please." '
The Standard says:' "For the first
time In centuries'. Europe has gone
down before 'Asia and Oriental troops
have vanquished In fair fighting a
wostern army." ,
Yet the paper goes on to reiterate
that the crowning triumph for the mo
ment Is denied" the 'Japanese, though
Kuropatkin, despite his "extraordinary
achievement," is still exposed to dis
aster.
General praise is again accorded the
Russian commander for his temporary
extrication and to the Russian troops
for their splendid discipline In defeat.
The military authorities say that if
the genius of Kuropatkin and the mor
ale of his men had not been strik
ingly brought out in the recent dis
patches there would be scarcely an
English paper to-day that would not
declare the fate of General Kuropat
kin's entire force already sealed.
Spencer Wilkinson, in the Morning
Post, points out that if General Kuro
patkin endeavored to retreat, in single
column his transport and force would
be so large that his first army corps
would have been marching three days
before the second could sart to follow
it. The railroad is of little use to him,
Wilkinson asserts, and he says that
Kuropatkin must be retreating in a
series of parallel columns, each not
larger than one army corps, and be
hind these the rear guard.
MUST WORK A MARVEL.
Here it is almost taken for granted
that a Japanese occupation of Mukden
must quickly ensue. No serious Eng
lish critic supposes' that Kuropatkin
will dream of making, such another at
tempt to stem the Japanese advance
as he did at Liaoyang. >. V '
HEAVY FIGHTING LOOKED FOK.
If the Russians can reach Harbin
they will, according to English opinion,
be lucky. Before that becomes a ques
tion of moment, however, it is ex
pected that desperate engagements
must be fought and the Japanese are
expected to risk even heavier casual
ties than they sustained at Liaoyang
in the final endeavor to annihilate Gen
eral Kuropatkin, either on the way to
Mukden or in the neighborhood of
Mukden itself. The fate of General
Kuropatkin's force depends, say the
English observers of the struggle, In
which they are so vitally interested,
upon the Russian general's ability to
confine these efforts to rear guard
actions. *
LONDON, Sept. 6.â The race of Gen
eral Kuropatkin for Mukden enthralls
the British press and public and mili
tary and other critics scarcely dare
venture a brief surmise as to Its re*
suit. The best opinion inclines to the
belief that Kuropatkin will get through
with a respectable remnant of his great
army, tfcus robbing the Japanese of
the complete fruits of their victory,
but it is realized that the Russians will
not be "out of the woods" for several
days.
The latest report is that General
Kuropatkin is once more in danger of
being cut off, and it is believed here
to be likely that this report will be
repeated several times before the issue
of the sanguinary struggle Is decided.
English military critics base such opin
ions as they have upon the immense to
pographical difficulties General Kuroki
must overcome before intercepting
Kuropatkin, who, they hold, has shown
ability to take advantage of every
phase in the strategy of retreat. If
Kuroki now succeeds after failing in
the initial attempt he will have accom
plished, in the English view, an almost
superhuman achievement.
"There was a lull in the fighting on
August 31. General Marosovsky, who
was on the firing line the whole time,
sat down with a Cossack picket in the
shelter of the trees for a cup of tea and
a biscuit. The Japanese artillery sud
denly swept the woods with their fire
and a shell burst, wounding the general
in the leg and tearing off his orderly's
arm." :SV; :..-, .... .:-.*w. '. . .',
"In many of the companies all of the
officers were killed or wounded and the
men fought under non-commissioned
officers. Many of the Japanese wounded
fell into the Russian trenches and

the retreat commenced, and had to be

by censor).â A Russian correspondent
who has arrived here from Liaoyang
gives some details of the final assaults
on that place. He says: /:â¢
"At the Untie of the Japanese bom
bardment of the railway station the
ambulances were in the rear of the sta
tion, from which it was. Impossible to
move them. A shrapnel shell which
burst over the station wounded two
nurses, one of whom has since died.
% ".The hottest fighting was on August
SO and 31, when the repeated assaults of
the enemy were all repulsed. The Thir
ty-fourth and Thirty-fifth regiments of
the Ninth Division and the Twenty
third Regiment of the Eastern Divi
sion were particularly hard pressed and
were several times reinforced. Ammu
nition could not be brought quickly
enough, and the men at times actually
stoned their assailants.
ST. PETERSBURG. Sept. 6.-/Ac
cording to the military authorities, all
Kuropatkin's hopes and plans for vic
tory were dashed by the wonderful
celerity with 'which Oyama's right
pushed forward - after crossing the
Taitse River. " Here Kuropatkin's in
formation* evidently was faulty in be
lieving that he had before him. the
whole of the \ Japanese forces which
had crossed over to the .right bank.
He had already completed a prelimin
ary bombardment of Kuroki's force on
Friday and was about to strike him
when he discovered that another Jap
anese column had crossed the river
farther up stream.- This column was
marching with great rapidity westward
to 'cut the railroad and close the door
on the Russian retreat to- Mukden.
Just at this point there is a; hiatus
in the reports. .Whether Kuropatkin
actually attempted ' to deliver a blow
against Kuroki' is not clear. At all
events, if he did he was compelled to
desist upon the discovery of the north
erly Japanese column. The latter took
him by surprise.
General Orloff's division, which suf
fered severely, had just arrived from
European Russia. Although this divi
sion was thrown Into confusion and
lost a frightful number of men, the
temporary check it was able to give
the Japanese probably saved the rail
road for Kuropatkin. In the mean
time Kuroki, freed from Kuropatkin.
marched hastily westward to intercept
General Stakelberg, who was crossing
the. river from the left bank. g It was
then that Kuropatkin thought Stakel
berg's corps was* lost and so' reported
to the War Office. But Kuroki was too
late. Stakelberg not only succeeded in
getting his corps across, but marched
at high speed thirty miles to Yentai,
actually arriving in time to come to
the support of hard-pressed Orloff. â¢

ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 5.â A dispatch from Kuropatkin, forwarded yesterday evening, indicates
that General Kuropatkin 's army and Kuroki's army are racing for Mukden and that the result is in

The forces 'of Kuropatkin and Oyama are racing for Mukden. This much stands out in the "news of
Monday and is indicated in a report forwarded by Kuropatkin, who says that his retreat is beinj? con
ducted hi. perfect order, though th e Japanese on Sunday repeatedly attacked his rear and continued the
attack until Monday. The result of the race is in doubt. The united Russian forces are. now north of Yen
tai, a station on the railway about ten miles northeast. of Liaoyang. They are pushing on to Mukden to
which the bulk of Japanese forces is marching direct, after having swarmed across the Taitse River.' A
strong Japanese flanking column is about thirty miles northeast- of Liaoyang and is trying to get between
the Russian forces and Mukden. With this race in pi-ogress there comes a brief dispatch from Mukden
saying that preparations for the evacuation of .that : place are proceeding. This report, if well founded,'
would mean the abandonment of the whole of Southern Manchuria and . the winding up of the present

The State Department all. along has

ernment There are no recent develop
ments in the case of the two steam
ships mentioned, and in view of the in
decision of the Russian commission en
gaged in examining the question of
contraband immediate action is not ex
pected. The disposition of the high
Russian officials, as viewed in Wash-

of foodstuffs as being contraband from
the- standpoint of N policy rather than
from the well-defined rules of interna
tional law.

pressed by Embassador McCormick
for .-in answer to the representations
of the United States in regard to the
cargoes of the Portland and Asiatic
line steamship Arabia and the British
BteaiDShip Calchas. both captured by
the Vladivostok squadron. It is un
derstood that the United States now
goes to the extent of asking for the
r.elease of the cargoes.
The Foreign Office, however, is un
able to give a definite response to the
representations made pending the de
cision of the commission which is ex
amining the nuestion of contraband
of war. The commission is not mak
ing much progress, owing to the posi
tion taken by Grand Duke Alexander

of Mercantile Marine and brother-in
law of the Emperor, and Grand Duke
Alexis, the high admiral and uncle of
his Majesty, who are standing out
against the American and British
view of foodstuffs as conditional con
traband, on the ground that if the
contention were allowed it would be
idle to attempt to stop contraband
bound for Japan.

Department confirmation is obtained of
the statement in the St. Petersburg dis
patch that America has asked for the
release of the cargoes of the steamships

Kuropatkin estimates his losses up to
and including September 4 at 16,000.
This is considered to be a very conser
\ative figure. The loss to the Japanese
probably will be double this number,
owing to their position as attaAers.
Kurnpatkin says nothing regarding
the k es of guns, but it is probable that
some of the heavier emplaced guns at
Liaoyang had to be abandoned.
There is* no truth in the report that
Kuropatkin has been wounded or that
Lieutenant General Linevitch is mov
ing to hi? support. General Linevitch
is still at Vladivostok.
The Japanese have thrown a strong
flanking column across the Taitse River
at Benitzu. about thirty miles north
east of Liaoyang. This column is hur
rying to the northeast and endeavoring
t-Â« got in between the Russian army
and Mukden. It is against this move
ment that KuropatkJn has dispatched
J^utonant General Rennenkampf with
s Cossack division, which it is believed
is already blocking the eastern high
road.
Kuropatkin has three roads over
which he is marching toward Mukden,
besides the double-tracked railroad.
The latter is chiefly occupied in the
transportation of gun? and of equip
ment, of which there is a great quan
tity. The Fnldiers are marching in light
order, and most of the wounded have
already been dispatched north by rail.
General Kuropatkin in a telegram to
the general staff filed at 1 p. m. on
Feptember 5 north of Yentai says the
Japanese on Sunday engaged his rear
fruard south of Yentai. the fight con
tinuing until Monday. The telegram
details the precautions taken to check
mate the Japanese flankers.
A strong flanking column on the east
is pushing rapidly northward in the
effort to head off the Russians. Against
this column General Kuropatkin has
ecnt a strong cavalry division to the
northeast, which it is believed is al
ready in position to check the Japanese
Hankers, while to the westward Kuro
patkin is moving a division toward
{?insrr.intin. thirty miles west of Muk
dtn, to meet any interference that may
be attempted from the direction of
Vinkow or Xev.chwang.
Oyama's advance is reported to be
engaging the Russian rear, bu.t it is not
expected to develop anything more se
rious than a Keries of rear guard ac

"Raffles" is significant, one more
straw in. the .direction of the. unre
spectable hero. He has been long out
moded, Â¦ but the Dick Turpins and
Georgie Barnwells were long the dar
lings of the people. Possibly Robin
Hood, gallant scamp, was the first to
reappear in polite society. We had
him at the Tivoli a few weeks ago.

Nancy 'of '"In the Bishop's Carriage"
will soon.be seen "picking and steal

early chance to expound her "profes
sion."",; But we have here already a
"Raffles," which is our present busi
ness.' "â¢ J
. Perhaps . "society melodrama" best
describes the play. As every one knows
it .hinges, upon the theft of a diamond
necklace by Raffles, a man of apparent
wealth,- moving in the "best" society,
and , without seeming motive for
theft:.- .In . fact his motive is left
in the air. so far as the play goes. He
himself .'alleges "sport" as his reason,
but confesses also to an overwhelming
desire- to. steal. Kleptomania Is sug
gested'but not proved. Raffles mor
alizes; at. length upon his "soft spUt,"
as. Jo3e|ph Conrad calls it. making,
therefore,- a not altogether convincing

Integral part of the play. , .
; r Mr.-Eellew has the part of Raffles, as

steals- 6riTy from the rich, but unlike
iRoblrt ''Hdod he steals mostly ' from his
friends. -'It Ms not therefore easy wholly
to with him. Â¦ Still, in a
hunt '.'ohe'Â«s sympathies i run to the

White Whittlesey was complimented
by the Alcazar audience last evening
with several recalls for his impersona
tion of Robert Emmet. It was not a
thrilling impersonation of the Irish pa
triot by any- means, possibly because
the playwright did not supply the op*
portunitles that are requisite to make
up a real star part. George Osbourne
made a more interesting role of Michael
Dwyer than Whittlesey did of Emmet.
Barring the tendency of Whittlesey to
talk about "me country" In his oration
in the courtroom when he was sentenced
to death, he was as picturesque as could
be expected. His love scenes with Eu
genie Thais Lawton were not bad, but
condensed into small compass. Miss
Lawton has little to "do in the play.
Marie Howe as the servant did her cus
tomary stunt well. The story carries
its own interest, intrigue, improbabili
ties and Innate pathos of the historical
situation, and it runs briskly along on
the diffusion plan, with little interrup
tion. There is a good stage scene rep
resenting a pass in the Wicklow Moun
tain"'. The stock company gives a very
good account of 'itself, on the whole,
but the court scene could easily bÂ«
made less wooden.

furniture at 1138 Howard street, thinks
hoVsustalned-$2000 damage by the wet
ting of his stock: "The* furniture in Mrs.
Ferguson's lodging-house at 1136 How
ard street was deluged with water, and
her lodgers left , her. She estimates -her
damage, at $2000. Many of the lodgers
in the rooming-houses damaged by the
flre; lost practically . all their effects
either through water or fire.' Â¦ ' '.
To add to the interest of the occasion.
Chief of Police Wittman came upon
the scene and made some stinging com
ments on the conduct of the depart
ment's representatives at the fire.
By fortuitous circumstances no fatal
ities occurred. Hardly a more danger
ous locality could have been selected
tor the ravages of disastrous flames.
Most of the buildings were of three
stories, built of wood and occupied by
working people. Altogether there were
seventeen needy families that lost all
their household goods, either from
water or fire. The tarpaulins ' of the
Underwriters' Patrol prevented much
1 damage, but the salvage is incohsider
! able compared to the monetary loss.
According to the best information the
t flre started in the basement of Marcus
fKruger, a bottle dealer at 1136 Howard
street. He employed Chinamen to pack
bottles in his basement. Kruger thinks
that one of the employes dropped a
cigarette in a pile of packing straw,
which was the beginning of the blaze.
From Kruger's place the fire rapidly
spread to the adjoining flats fronting
on' Howard and Natoma streets. So
great was their headway when the Fire
Department arrived that the back por
) tions of fourteen fla^s were burned to
i. charcoal. An immense amount of water
j was turned in by the Fire Department
I to stay the flames. This saved the
block and perhaps a disastrous* con
! flagration for the city, but It was bad
I for the furniture owned by the occu
[ pants of the flats.
I Before the tenants of the flats real
| ized that a fire was raging in their
homes the flames were reaching sky
ward; Women rushed into Natoma and
Howard streets, carrying' their children
in their arms and screaming for help
for their household goods.-- .
Mrs. Mills, a lodger in the second floor
of the flat at 11 38' Folsom street', tried
to Jump from the window ' of her
apartments, but was restrained by a
man who avoided notoriety for a heroic
deed by refusing to give his name. Mrs.
i Mills had been singed around the head
i and face by the flames. Little 8-year
j old Ida McMahon, left by a widowed
mother to care for an 18-month3-old
baby, grabbed her charge and walked
with her sister into the flames. Fire
men from Engine No. 8 carried the two
children back to the Howard-street exit
and safety and then resumed the work
of directing streams and treading
shaky porches.
The police arrangements for the fire
were the limit of culpability. Crowds
of unauthorized persons gathered dur
1ns the first half hour and until Ser
geant Green of the Southern Station
| arrived on the scene and took charge
of the crowd the firemen were badly
impeded in their work. Lieutenant
Colby had preceded Sergeant Green,
but he appeared unable to master the
crowd. .
Chief of Police Wittman happened
along at the right time, as usual, and
he gave Lieutenant Colby a tongue
lashing before the crowd that few men
would stand: for. He told the lieuten
ant, that he acted like -- old woman
In- officer's uniform and that he was
thojpughly incapable of handling a
crowd. Chief Wittman pointed out- that
the Â»flre lines had been made in such
shape as practically to cut off one half
of the effective force of jthe Fire De
| partment. Lieutenant Colby took his
I rebuke meekly and thereafter did his
best to keep the crowds under control.
During the conflagration $75,000 worth
of property was destroyed. Among the
losers are: . / . ' .

and a large number, of poor people

Does the reader recognize this anec
dote? Two months ago it was told
as a new story, a personal experience
to a Bostonian, who gains his bread
by. story writing. It was, new to him
and seeing possibilities in it he dressed
It in two shapes and sent one to New
York and one to London. \ His New
York editor returned the manuscript
with the footnote, "Old â had it." His
London editor, a friend in the house
of Harmsworth, wrote, "Quite sure
I've seen the horse-reins-umbrella
story." But mark the sequel:
In the same 'week, when, if it had
had good luck, the Boston version
would have appeared in a London
publication, a different version was
printed as original In the People's
Friend of Dundee, Scotland^ and a
fourth version, patched with purple
fragments of fine writing, appeared in
the Times of Cardiff, Wales.
Before either of these periodicals
could have reached this country two
other versions, presented as original,
illumintjS the pages of a Boston and a
St. Louis daily. The story had been
"In the air," as it were, over 5000 miles
of land and sea and five different writ
ers perceived It at substantially 5 the
same moment, brought it to earth, told
it in as many different ways and sever
ally congratulated .themselves on a
clever and original performance.
Writers have been doing this sort of
thing In good faith ever since the world
began. Only a year or two ago a story
of a faithful dog that ran after a stick
of dynamite and zealously fetched it to
his master was told, almost simultane
ously, by four men in as many maga
zines. The tragic-comic conception is
simple enough; very likely In essen
tials the tale dates back to Aristo
phanes, but how did it "happen ! to
occur" at the same time to the four?
May there not be something in- the
whimsical theory another literary man
propoundsâ that the Intensity â¢ with
which an author dwells upon his i^ea,
before and during the period of 'exploi
tation, "impresses it on the spiritual at
mosphere," bo that the wonder would
be if "sensitive, seeking minds" did not
seize upon It? Horrid possibilities are
latent in telepathy. The day may dawn
when a man who cherishes an in
genious plot will have to surround him
self with non-conductorsâ cigarette
fiends, perhaps, and girls who chew,
gum.â Boston Transcript.

Yesterday Secretary Shaw" viewed thÂ«
labor parade from the Palace Hotel.
Afterward he was the guest of W. B.
Hamilton. Deputy Collector of the Port,
at the Family club. Then he was the
guest of General Stone on a three
hours' trip to the Cliff House. This
morning Secretary Shaw will see the
Templars' parade, and at noon will" go
to Berkeley, where he will be the guest
of President Benjamin Ide Wheeler. At
3:30 o'clock this afternoon he will speak
to the students of the university "at the
Harmon Gymnasium.
There was more talk,- equally favor
able to the coast, made by Benjamin
Ide Wheeler, president of the Univer
sity of California: Fred Holman of the
Portland Commercial Club and Ad
miral Henry Glass of the. Pacific squad
ron. Admiral Glass has been In the
Asiatic ports and observed-the-oppor
tunities for the extension of American
commerce. .
But the dinner was not altogether a
national proposition. Mr. Stratton had
something to say about the business of
the port of San Francisco and the pros
perity of the Pacific slope. He dis
cussed the relations of this commercial
empire with the Orient. He set forth
that the entire imports of the United
States In 1903 aggregated $84,000,000, out
of which San Francisco had 137.000,000.
The exports of this republic, said Mr.
Stratton. in the last fiscal year were
$72,000,000, and $39,000,000 went out of
the Golden Gate. â¢ .
The . Secretary of the Treasury was
listened to and applauded. His ideas
met with the approval of men of af
fairs, who give keen Judgment to every
thing affecting commercial and finan
cial progress. Â¦ '?.+ -,
CAUGHT TÂ»IE IJSTEXERS.
I desire to go on record as being opposed
to the Issuance of any currency that the Gov
ernment does not guarantee, and I am equally
opposed to the Government guaranteeing bank
currency without being first amply secured.
But one- fourth of 1 per cent Interest on the
currency Issued, under conditions such as I
have described, would pay the fnsurance. Any
insurance company would be glad to take the
risk at that rate. The tax on this credit cur
rency should be kept sacred to the redemp
tion of the currency of any failed bank.
The only othtr plan that seems to me at all
feasible would be permission to Issue a small
volume of heavily taxed currency baÂ«;d upon
bonds other than Government bonds. I am not
certain, however, that this would prove as
clastic as some of the friends of the plan con
tend It Feems to me that the banks, when
their surplus is running low. can hardly be
expected tr> purchase any kind of bonds as a
basic of circulation.
While thts weakness in our system is quite
universally recognized, there is a great diver
sity of ODinion a* to the best remedy. I am
well aware of a deep-seated prejndlce against
atset or credit currency. I. do not join in this
apprehension, however. Permit me to suggest
a plan. I do not suggest it as the only plan,
and I do not suggest it coupled with a recom
mendation that it be adopted. There may be
something better. I am simply suggesting the
desirability of adding the element of elasticity
to our system, and if it Is to be added some
plan must be devised. This Is one: Suppose
the national banks are granted permltaion to
Issue a certain volume of currency, either
based upon the capital of the bank or upon the
amount of bond secured currency, and are
charged not less than 5 per cent interest dur
ing the time this currency Is out. Certainly
the currency will spring into existence when
ever money Is scarce, and if the banks are
compelled to pay 5 Der cent â¢ Interest thereon
they will retire It as soon as the pinch Is over.
It can be retired by a deposit of an equal vol
ume of money at any of the subtreasurle*. It
will not be necessary t<> redeem each individual
bill. The volume of money would be contract
ed by the deposit as well as by the actual de
struction of the bank bills issued. The Gov
ernment can afford to guarantee the redemp
tion of this credit currency. The Interest
charged would vastly more than cover all pos
sible less.
This %iuch I have said preliminary to the
suggestion of a possible Improvement. Our
rurrency system Is not elastic. I By elasticity
I do not mean an elastic dollar, but an elastic
volume of dollars. In practice there Is a
slight elasticity In our system, but it works
adversely to our need, Whenever the reserve
In the banks runs low there Is an Induce
ment to retire circulation for the purpo.Â«e of
Belling the bonds, thus increasing the reserve.
Whenever rates of interest are high it Is un
profitable to maintain national bank circula
tion. Therefore, when money Is scarce there
is another Inducement to Its retirement. Cer
tainly, banks whose reserve has run low will
rot exhaust thin reserve In the purchase of
Government bonds as a basis of circulation
which Is not available as reserve. Therefore,
when money is scarce and interest ratrs high
there is a tendency to contract national bank
circulation. 'Whenever money Is plenty and a
drug on the market there is an Inducement to
increase circulation, for under such conditions
national bank circulation is maintained at a
profit. , -
The farme r needs mere grain sacks at har
vest time than in seeding time, and it Is
equally true that the country needs more
money In harvest time than In seeding time.
Here on the coast the farmer retires his. grain
sacks when he disposes of hi* crop: but the.
banks ara unable to contract their medlurn of
exchange witlj . the disposition of the crop.
Railroads retire their unneeded medium of ex
change, freight cars, during the growing sea
eon by placing them on sidetracks. If a
freight car could be reissued as cheaply aa a
bank note the railroads would burn their cars
in the spring and rebuild in the fall. Banks
might retire their unneeded money during the
summer, but there is no Inducement so to
do. 'As a result, during the summer money
reeks Investment at very low rates of Interest
and when needed in the fall It is occupied.' .
REMEDIES NOT APPARENT.
In speaking to the business men 6f
the West Mr. Shaw was not backward
in setting forth his ideas of finance.
His address follows: ?
In every line of builnees equipment Is of
prime Importance. The United States nan
taken first * place In the commercial world
and I believe it has the best financial sys
tem In the world. I am not here to eay that
cur financial system Is perfect, but as neither
political pÂ»rty Is proposing any change In
the frystrm I thlnk.it will not be deemed in
appropriate if I express the opinion that It
is the best system, all in all, in existence.
First, it is stable. Every dollar Is actually
exchangeable for gold. It is true that we nave
over $300,000,000 of straight flat money, but
it is expressly redeemable In gold, and a gold
reserve of $150,000,000 ia especially set asidu
fcr this purpose. It is true that the metallic
value of our silver Is more than $300,000,000
lees than its current value, but it Is made
the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to
maintain the parity of all forms of money
coined or issued by the Government. This can
mean nothing else than that silver at least,
if not Bthrar certificates, are to be redeemed
in sold whenever presented.- The national
bank note is redeemable In lawful money and
secured by a deposit of Government bonds.
We therefore have the largest volume of cir
culating medium in the world, and its re
demption or exchangeability for gold practi
cally guaranteed by the Government. So safe
and secure is cur system at every point that
no one thinks of examining the character of
the money that may b* tendered. He only
Inquires as to Us genuineness, if genuine
he knows that It is as good as gold.
At a dinner tendered to Hon.' Leslie
M. Shaw last night in the quarters of
the Pacific-Union . Club there were
gathered seventy-four representatives
of San Francisco's highest financial
and commercial institutions, regardless
of politics. The feast was tendered by
the Commercial Club and the invita
tions were non-partisan and directed to
those most interested in hearing the
views of the Secretary of the National
Treasury. Frank J. Symmes presided.
F. S. Stratton, Collector of the Port,
was the head and front of the affair,
and he did himself proud in setting
forth the proper place of San Francisco
in the commerce of the Far East. ..'Â¦:.:Â¦Â¦
rality of 31,000 (given to Stickney for
Governor in, 1900) to a flsrure* which
would indicate a significant , gain in
Democratic strength and as pointing
to a national Democratic victory. A
Republican plurality under 25,000
would be regarded by the Democrats
as a victory. The Republican leaders
expect at least 25,000.

of the letter, .white the remainder is
made up of ,th*e usual roundabout, and

United States Consul Peter' Strick

rail has been laid oh the road which
now connects the river Senegal with
the Niger. Trains on schedule time will
soon be running over it When this
road i3 in operation a vast region with
great resources for development. will be
open for those who are well situated to
profit thereby. Unfortunately, for lack
of steamers engaged in the foreign
trade, Americans cannot be considered
among these. . French steamers of 1500
tons nowâ hr the rainy season and for
some time afterâ can ascend the Sene
gal with their cargoes as far as Kayes
(about 1 600 * miles as the river runs),
whence there Is a railroad in operation
to Bafoulabe, on ; the same river. The
extension 'of this": line through a dis
trict which produces , rubber, and gold

secure for dominion ports the Canadian
trade of the British West Indies. In

SACRAMENTO, Sept. 5. â The labor
unions of Sacramento observed Labor
day with a celebration at Oak Park.
There was no parade. Business houses
were closed during the day. The

this afternoon orations were delivered
by citizens of the city.
One of the greatest throngs that ever
entered the doors of the Palace Hotel
filled the great court of the hostelry

being the several receptions given
there. The streets outside the hotel
were blockaded and the great court in

throngs.
Those who. had the fortitude to re

the order predominating. Everything
possible was done to make the guests
comfortable. Inside the spacious rooms
many old ties of friendship were re

In the evening the members of the

show In the theater. Though the night
was a trifle chilly hundreds remained
until the show was over. Then dancing
in the upper floor of the pavilion con
cluded what the council unanimously
votes "the pleasantest Labor day that
they have ever known."
Society iÂ« on organism and Its ran* are*
constantly assuming new relations that bring
to the foreground new duties. There Is a
charge made against the trade unionists which
no fane man would attempt to deny â that their
mistakes have been grievous and many, and
because they have made mistakes there is a
sentiment expressed by some unthinking per
sons that the trades unions should be, de
stroyed. Shall they be discarded because they
have erred? Shall they be disrupted becau&e
they an not perfect? If this be the pro
gramme of Eociety no form of human organt
zaiun could remain Intact â cay, not an ln
dlridual could survive the application and
operation cf this rule. Â¦ The honest man in
society will not advocate the destruction of
the workers' organizations because of recog
nized errors. Aa well attempt to destroy the
church organizations cr the honorable pro
fession of law because all Christians are not
kind and all lawyers not honest. There are
acknowledged evils in the system of popular
government under which we live, and for this
should wa strive to cause the .downfall of the
republic?
The labor question is the question of the
hour. As every lake, every river and every
pool reflects the light of the sun, so do we
find the reflection of the labor movement in
every newspaper, in the speech of every, states
man and in the sermon from every pulpit.
This widespread discussion and publicity
makes possible the progress of the people . and
advances the Interests of industrial justice. As
every American citizen reveres the memory of
tho Pilgrim fathers and those who laid the
foundations of this Government, so do' thosa
who have an Intimate knowledge of the labor
movement held dear In memory those who
were foremost in bringing about these labor
crganizations, wlJoh mean eo much for . the
workers and for the social advancement of
cur people. With the progress of their Â¦ work
and a Just appreciation of their powers and
opportunities, the ends sought by the trades
unions will be accomplished with wisdom aad
diligence. It Is the hope of the members of
the trades unions and* of all reasonable citi
zens of this republic that the hour may not
be long deferred when happiness, will be a
synonym of prosperity , and when wealth Is
recognized oaly fcr the good It can and doea
accomplish.
SOME MISTAKES MADE.
The most Interesting thing In connection
with the trades union Is the study of Its ef
fects and the marklne of its results In rela
tion to the people of this country. There are a
great many otherwise wise men and women
who look upon the trades union movement as a
very new thing. ; As a matter of fact." the prin
ciples which underlie the trades uplon move
ment <aÂ» well aÂ« the forminsr of workers Into
organizations) bear the marks of remote an
tiquity. In reality the only new thing in re
gard to the workingmen and their organiza
tions of to-day is that they are confronted with
a new set of antasonlsts, well equipped to
carry on a vigorous opposition to the desires
of the producers.
Is there a fair-minded person in any quarter
of the globe who questions that "the working
people have solid grounds for claiming: better
conditions?" Is there a person who believes
the end sought by the trades organization has
been accomullebed? The ethics of our people
generally a*ree with our economic conditions.
Where eoierty Is present we seek (without
hope for disappointment) for vice, crime and
iniquity: where Â©overt y is in civilization to
day there morality is least likely to be found.
So long as the evils exist of which the trade
unionists comolaic so long will poverty exist,
and while it exists the trade unionists will not
have completed their work. '

Grand Marshal McCarthy and his aids.
Behind him marched the thousands of
sturdy toilers that form the Building
Trades Council.
The following unions were In line:
THOUSANDS IN PARADE.
The two great , labor organizations,
the Building Trades Council and the
San Francisco Labor Council, cele
brated Labor day yesterday with all
the pomp and enthusiasm befitting the
occasion.
The Building Trades Council parad
ed in full force in the morning, and in
the afternoon- thronged Shell Mound
Park In company with the Building
Trades Council of Alameda.
The San Francisco Labor. Council
cheered their brethren" of the building
trades as they tramped along the
streets. In the afternoon the unions
affiliated with the Labor Council held
literary exercises at the Chutes. In
the evening they> watched the vaude
ville show and after that the floor was
cleared for dancing.
It was a great day for organized la
bor. The thousands ' who toil with
their hands crowded the streets and
sidewalks. All wore some insignia de
noting their trade. .
The parade of the Building Trades
Council wound from Fourth and Mar
ket streets far up Van Ness avenue.
The tardy arrival of the council's
float delayed the procession, which
was to have started at 9, until 10.
â¢The float represented the three
stages of a building in the course of
construction. On it were seated rep
resentatives from every union affiliat
ed with the organization. Another
float that excited considerable admir
ation was the model battleship built
by the Ship-builders' and Boiler-makÂ».
ers' Union. It was so. large .^that? a
heavy truck was required to carry it.'
On the miniature man-of-war was a
crew of little sailors composed of the
children of the builders.
A mounted guard of honor headed
the procession. The guard was made
up of the following: M. Collins. A.
E. Fields, M. J. Kirwan. J. M. Decker,
W. A. Griflln, Felix Scheerer, C. P.
St. John, E. J. Deaver, J. A. de Vec
mon. Eugene Clancy and Ralph Mc-
Laren.
Union Men March in
an Extensive
Parade.
Chicago wheat prices are abnormal
and the usual proportion between
Liverpool and Chicago prices has been
obliterated. Liverpool prices no longer
govern the Chicago market, with the re
sult that with existing rates fixed by
shipowners of England, France and
Germany, dealers cannot afford to sell
wheat for export at present and the In
terior markets of this country fix the
prices that the growers of the Colum
bia basin receive for their product.
The combination of sailing shipown
ers above referred to. has fixed a rate
t*t TTs 6d from Portland and 26s 3d from
Tacoma. Friday export wheat. The
ratÂ© was made last year 15s to 17s 6d.

.At the opening performance last
evening, the big theater was packed
with the strangers within the city's
gates. The interest they manifested
ihthe curtain-raiser, a melodrama
dealing with a brace of true lovers, a
scheming, heavy father,: a group of
banditti and the inevitable wise judge,
\vas intense. Â£ The fighting, of which
there was . a great deal, won thun
derous plaudits, and even when the
action dragged â which it frequently
didâ there was* 'a running patter, of
handclaps. When the curtain cameâ
after.the dough-faced heroine, a gen
tleman of wondrous dexterity with a
spear, had killed all the objectionable
personagesâ there was a recall Uiat
fairly shook the "house, and all. the
pi incipal players bowed low in
acknowledgment of the unwonted tri
bute to their' art.
When the curtain rose again, after
an; overture by ! union musicians, the
women of the audience uttered a pro
lenged admiring "O-o-h!" -.For there
stood about twoYdozen-little 'maidens
from the. Chinese Public School, attired
in thejvari-colored garb of, their race;
and, under", the Invisible prompting of
their teacher, Miss A. C. Griffith, they;
sang- pretty little, songs â¢ In ../_Â¦ English;
They., came the boy pupi^-^more of
them . than -.there . was . stageroom . f or
when 1 they .stood ,' in single ' fileâ andj
marshaled;' .by . Professor. ; George S.
Miehling, they, performed calisthenics
and played ; school 'games. After that
all the boys and:glrls assembled and
scng ". "America," ; , and the - audience
stood up while, they..." sang .-it. â¢ *'â¢
-Another -'drama rounded, out. the

rat find anywhere else in America â
a Chinese theater without an atmos

the nonce the stage that has been
strutted by Caucasia's greatest dra
matic and musical artists is in pos
session Â¦ of a company of mummers
from the Celestial quarter, and they
have transformed it into an exact fac
simile of the stage they left behind

PROGRAMME
OF EVENTS
FOR TO-DAY
Chief of Staff Is
â¢ .sues Final
Orders.
The Los Angeles Knights Templar
made the pilgrimage to San Francisco
in a special train of ten Pullman sleep
ers, that left the Arcade depot Sunday.
The train was resewed for the Sir
Knights and their families, but so
unanimous was the desire of the Los
Angeles members to participate in the
festivities incident to the Triennfal
Conclave that their special train could
not accommodate all who desired to
come. The members who could not ob
tain accommodations on the train have
come on the regular trains, some of
them several days ago, and If a poll
were taken of the Los Angeles members
in San Francisco it would reveal the
presence of fully 80 per cent of the total
membership In that city.
I A committee has been left at home to
look after belated Eastern command
eries, of 'Â¦ which there are a number due
to pass through Los Angeles to-day.
They will 'stay In Los Angeles only a
few hours, however, and later most of
the members of the committee will go
north.
' Every train that left Los Angeles
yesterday was run in two or, three sec
tions' ; and there were several special
trains besides. Since last Wednesday
the Los Angeles members have been !
entertain Itig visiting Knights and at j
no .time, has the Masonic Temple .been :
closed. - This entertainment v/ill be con- i
tinued after the conclave, for It Is ex
pected ' that several thousand . i Sir
Knights: who reached Ean Francisco
by northern routes wiir visit Southern^
California on their way home.
.Elaborate ,Â¦Â¦, preparations ~ have been
made' for the reception the Los Anee-'
The escorts of Knights from the sev
eral local commanderles and the Grand
Commandery of California have been
the recipients ,of praise , for their fine
appearance. Oakland Commandery No.
11, which has been doing its share of
the escort work,. is proud of the com
mendation bestowed upon it as being
one of the crack infantry escort compa
nies of the conclave. Its services be
gan Saturday and will, end this morn
ing. The members forming this escort
company leave their homes at 5:30 a.
m., the company crosses the bay from
Oakland to San Francisco on the first
boat and remairis on duty until the
last commandery has been properly
taken care of.
"While thousands of the city's visitors
filled the sidewalks yesterday and over
flowed into the streets, commanderies
from all parts of the country still
poured their numbers into San Fran
cisco. All morning the trains were ar
riving, parties of visiting Knights were
being taken in charge by the escorts,
their baggage looked to and all their
needs answered.
Yesterday morning a special train on
the Union Pacific pulled in with six
Pullman cars filled with the Nebraska
Grand Commandery, under charge of
Assistant General Passenger Agent
Garrett Ford. Among the officers of the
commandery were Grand Command
er William J. Turner, Deputy Grand,
Commander Carroll D. Evans. Grand*
Captain General E. W. Beghtol, acting
Grand. Generalissimo Oscar Allen and
Past Grand Commanders F. E. White,
Charles B. Finch, G. W. LJnneger and

DR. PIERCE'S TTBTMKIH tTJt- .
HOW TO WIN A HUSBAND.
Woman's sphere in this aoth century is
not limited any more than is man's. She
can occupy almost any business position
or profession, and yet the popular view cf
womanhood is that she best fits the posi-
tion of wife and mother and head of tho
household. Every girl should know her
heart and also know that her womanly
system is equal to the strain of marriajre.
If a girt is nervous and irritable ten chances
to one it is due to some trouble peculiar to
womanhood.
Cupid has bo place in a girl's, heart if
she is nervous and irritable, feels dragged
down, worn out for no reason that she can
think cf. The weak back, dizzy spells and
black circles about the eyes are only symp-
toms. Go to the source of the trouble and
correct the irregularity. Stop the drains
en the womanly system- ana the other
symptoms will ' disappear. This can be
done easily rod ' intelligently. So sore of
it is the World's Dispensary Medical Asso-
ciation, the proprietors of Dr. Pierce's Fa-
vorite Prescription,* that . they offer $500
reward for women who cannot be cured of
leucorrhea, female weakness, prolapsus, or
falling of the womb. All they ask is a fair
and reasonable trial of their means of cure.
"Your 'Favorite Prescription' cored me of
ulceration aad inflammation, from which I suf-
fered for many years," writes Mrs. Oelpoia
Wheaton, President Santa Barbara Lawn Ten-
nis Club, Arlington Hotel, Santa Barbara. Calif.
"Health was completely broken down when I
began its use and I was in dreadful pain mast
of the time, but ten bottles cured me."

parade in the morning, when they all
turned out and marched to strains of
martial music; there was a barbecue
after that at Idora Park, where every
body ate, drank and was merry; there
were literary exercises, when prominent j
labor unionists told the others about j
their hopes and expectations for union
labor; there were games still later In
the afternoon, when labor union con
tested with labor union in friendly riv
alry; and to cap the day's enjoyment,
there was a dance in the evening.
TUCSON, Ariz.. Sept. 5. â A feud of
two years' standing resulted last night
in the death of Jose M. Aguirre. who
belongs to the best known Mexican
family in Tucson.
Ill feeling over the branding of cat
tle has existed for a long time be
tween the Aguirres, who have a ranch
on the San Pedro, and Carmen Es
cobedo, foreman of Albert Steinfeld's
Anvil ranch.
Sunday both men came to Tucson
to witness the Labor day celebration.
They were brought together by friends
and were having dinner together in
a restaurant in the Mexican quarter
when they renewed their old quarrel,
exchanging some hot words, and Es
cobedo shot Agairre dead. Escobedo
surrendered to officers attracted by
the shooting. He claims Aguirre used
a knife, although none was found
near the tody.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Ca!i
A number of visiting Knights Tem
plar have been victimized. Robberies
and pickpocket* cases have been of
frequent occurrence, but the latest
graft that has come to the notice of
the police is the selling of tickets for
trips through Chinatown which call
for a licensed guide. Last night seven
teen of the visitors reported to Lieu
tenant Shaw that they had purchased
tickets from Herman Lichtenfeld, a
Grant-avenue tailor, at Jl apiece.
When the Knights called at Lich
t^nfeld's place on Grant avenue they
were given in charge of an ex-
Chinatown guide named W. Ward,
whose license was some time ago re
voked by the Police Commissioners
for an alleged assault. Ward took hi3
party around the street3 in the Chi
nese quarter for about fifteen minutes
and then told them that he had shown
them all that he could. The people
called at the police station and branded
Lichtenfeld and Ward as grafters.
Captain Martin was notified and a de
tective was sent with the party to the
tailor's place of business. Lichtenfeld
was compelled to refund the money
he had taken from the seventeen
Knights and was warned under the
penalty of arrest to desist, from sell
ing any more of his tickets. The peo
ple- who were temporarily victimized
by Lichtenfeld and Ward claim that at
least 250 of their fellow Knights pur
chased tickets of Lichtenfeld and saw
nothing for their dollar.

r.or the dead boy's parents believe that
thÂ« shooting was anything but an ac
cident, and they see nothing to be
gained by arraigning Arvenon on a
criminal charge. The authorities at
tirst thought the shooting' followed
I laytul threats from Arvenon to fire
at Nelson, but this both Arvenon and
the other member of the hunting trio,
James Kelly, positively denied. In the
lace cf this denial the police were
Juried to accept Arvenon's statement
that the rifle went off while he was
Tampering 1 with the trigger mechun
iMti. Arvenon has been released, as
ihfre was no charge against him.
The physicians who treated Nelson
marvel that he lived so long: after re
t-eivinÂ£ a bullet full in the brain. Dr.
J. Edson KeJsey said the boy could
not live an hour after he was shot,
but he lingered for eijrht hours, then
died in a convulsion. The inquest will
Le held at 10 o'clock on Saturday next.
AliTIK ABVEXOX OBTAINS
FREEDOM FROM PROSECUTION"
The appearance of the man was so
sudden and his attack so violent that
neither Mrs. Longwell nor her guests
could give much of a description of th^
fellow except that he wore a dark suit
of clothes and wore his hat pulled low
over his eyes.
Mrs. Longwell is the wife of Sarn
LongweU, inspector of the Oakland
Transit Company.
Mrs. S. O. Longwell. residing at 2819
Grove street, was savagely attacked
last night In her own home b;* an un
known man and but for the presence
of two ladies, sisters of her husband,
who were visiting her. and a man. who
had accompanied them, the attack
might have ended in a tragedy.
Mrs. Longwell and her guests were
seated in the dining-room Just after
supper when the bell rang. Mrs. Long
well went to the front door, carrying
her baby with her. As she released
the latch the door was forced violently
open and a man sprang into the hall,
attempting as he did so to grasp Mrs.
Longwell by the throat. The terrified
woman turned and ran screaming Into
the dining-room, closely pursued by the
Intruder. As Mrs. Longwell reached
the room where her guests were seated
she fell in a faint and the unknown
man. seeing three other people present,
turned and ran from the house.

Kesolved. That the San Leandro Board of
Trade most strongly condemns the action of
several members of the Alameda County Ad
vancement Association for opposing the con
struction of the aforesaid road.
Whereas. The San Leandro Board of Trade
particularly urged the construction of the
foothill boulevard from High street to Hay
wards; now. therefore.
Whereas, It was clearly understood that
the purpose of Mid organization was to ad
vance the Interests of Alameda County: and
whirls Interests can best be subserved by the
cocslructio.1 and beautifying of our racdi and
thereby opening avenues for immigration and
settlement In our county; and.
The San Leandro Board of Trade, believing
in tbe representations made, heartily indorsed
the organization of the Alameda County Ad
vancement Association: and
Board of Trustees of the town of Haywards
C. W. Heyer. President; C. M. Reese. Town
Clerk.
The San Leandro Board of Trade has
adopted the following resolutions:
We are unanirro-js in the opinion that the
said boulevard, when completed, will be of
inestimable value to the trtm "and vicinity,
and alfc > to Alair.eda County generally.
We further consider that the abandonment
of the project at this time would be a serious
error and would result in definite injury to
this county and this town, in view of the
steps already taken, and the injurious adver
tUtag it would give us.
In full faith that you will do your utmost
to bring this magnificent project to a success
ful conclusion, we beg to subscribe ourselves.
Very faithfully.
To the Hcnorable Board of Supervisors of
Alair.eda Ccunty: We. the Trustees In *nd
for the town of Haywards. having the beÂ»t
interests of this town and vicinity at heart,
and having carefully considered all the steps
taken in the matter, hereby most respectfully
and earnestly petition and urge your honor
able body to purh to its completion the pro
rosed irm!c boulevard from the city of Oak
land to th!F tcÂ»wn.
The town of Haywards was so much
interested in the matter that the Town
Trustees have addressed the following
official communication to the Super
visors:

The delay brought forth all kinds of
support for the boulevard from the
other organizations of Alameda Coun
ty. This was started by Haywards,
which town will be the southern ter
minus of the road. Haywards was sup
ported by the Board of Trade of Oak
land, the Merchants' Exchange of Oak
land and the Board of Trade of San
Leandro. Committees from all of the
organizations Interested will be pres
ent at this meeting and there will be
many arguments made before the Su
pervisors. The largest delegation will
be that from Haywards. which will be
composed of the following citizens:
The Board of Supervisors will next
Wednesday listen to the arguments
over the route- of the foothill boule
vard and will decide whether they will
proceed with the work along the lines
projected. The delay in the carrying
mit of the work was caused by a pro
test sent to the board by the Alameda
County Association and the members
of this organization will present their
case at the coming meeting. The pro
test presented last week gave no argu
ments.

Mayor Oln**y has under preparation
a draft cf proposed chanpes in .thÂ«
munitipaJ charter of Oakland. This is
preliminary to the submission of his
ideas to ihe City Council, with the view
of presenting proposed amendments to
& vote of the people.
To reconstruct the Board of Public
\YÂ»rhs and the Hoard of Police and
Fire Commissioner* in such a way that
the police nnd lire departments shall
be removed from political influences
is the Mayor's principal aim. His
Honor believes that ihÂ« offices of City
Attorney and City Engineer should
be independent of the boards of which
both oJMcials, with the Mayor, are
members. The Mayor would create a
Uonrd of Public Works whose mem
bers should be piven full control over
expenditures independently of other of
licts. lie favors such a new assign
ment in the police and fire boards that
responsibility lor their conduct shall
iÂ»e placed under direction of a commis
sion which would be out of politics and
would not be compelled to electioneer
lor positions.

Investigation Falls to Corroborate
Statement That Patrolman
Robbed and Clubbed Him.
The police, after making a thor
ough investigation, have come to the
conclusion that the story told by T.
P. Grisnell of Wadsworth, Nev., of
having been robbed and clubbed by a
policeman early Saturday morning, is
without foundation. Grisnell's two,
brothers and his brother-in-law called
upon Captain Martin yesterday and
said that Grisnell was irresponsible
when under the influence of liquor.
He had said nothing to them of be
ing robbed by a policeman until af
ter it appeared in the newspapers.
The .fact that the alleged robbery
occurred on Spear street, near Mar
ket, instead of on Pillmore street, near
Market, as he positively asserted,
shows of itself that Grisnell had a
hazy recollection of what happened
to him. Policeman J. S. Barrett was on
duty on Spear street Saturday morn
ing, and he declared 'that he did not
see Grisnell nor did he hear of any one
being robbed and clubbed. * Grisnell
had a look at Barrett and said he was
not the man. He saw all the men of
that watch, with a like result.

TO ARRIVE.
Weather Bureau Tells of Conditions In
Berlin, Paris, Lisbon. London,
Honolulu and Manila.
San Francisco received reports yes
terday of the weather conditions from
two-thirds of the world. Of the 360
degrees of longitude the local branch
of the Weather Bureau heard from
240. -This is the first time that the
meteorologists have accomplished the
feat. Of all the cities from which
weather reports came San Francisco
was the most favored, all things con
sidered. Professor McAdie sent word
last evening to the visiting Knights
Templar trom England what the
weather was in London.
In San Francisco the weather was
clear and the temperature was 62 de
grees. In Ireland there was rain. In
Paris the temperature was 64 degrees.
In Honolulu the weather was cloudy
and the temperature was 78 degrees-
In Hamburg and Berlin the weather
was clear. In Lisbon it was cloudy.
The people of Scotland, with the Fili
pinos as well, had cloudy weather. In
London it did not rain, but as usual
there was plenty of fog.
Â¦ .The Weather Bureau expects to re
ceive these reports daily henceforth,
so that visitors from all parts of the
world may hear of the conditions in
their home cities.
HEARS REPORTS FROM s â¢
TWO-THIRDS OF WORLD
The women managers of the Old Peo
ple's Home, corner of Pine and Pierce
streets, are serving "a fine luncheon
daily between the hours of 11 a. m.
and 2 p. m. at 207 Grant avenue for the
benefit of the institution. A fire recent
ly did, damage to the building amount
ing "to $45,000.' It is for the purpose of
raising funds to help meet the loss that
the puncheon is being given.
Many society" members availed them
selves of the opportunity to aid the
cause .yesterday. The lunch place is
beautifully decorated and nothing is
left undone to merit the satisfaction of
those who patronize this worthy cause.
1 A false impression has gone forth that
the institution is 'endowed and needs
no financial assistance from outside
sources. This is an error. The women
managers are seriously crippled finan
cially since the fire, as the insurance
only partly met the great loss caused
thereby..
. The luncheon will be continued at the
hours mentioned both to-day and to
morrow. The ladies having the affair
in charge- and who personally attend
to the comfort of guests are the follow
ing named: Mesdames W. Willis,
George A. Knight, A. W. Scott. J. Mar
tel, Louis Deane, W. Dick, W. Matson,
A. Watt, C. C. Wadsworth, D. E. Friele.
W. Brown. E. A. Bresse and F. Mc-
Williams.
The (og that within a comparatively
few boon has caused the stranding In
and near this port of the big British
Ehip Drumburton. the schooner James
A. GarJIeM and the steamers Xewburg j
and Maggie, ivas responsible for a col
lision off Point Reyes early yesterday
morning between the passenger-laden
euaixuer Pomona and the steam schoon
er Wtstport. Both vessels were dam
aged, but reached port in safety and
without any loss of life, although the
Â¦ Pomona's passengers received a bad
scare.
The Pomona was bound for this port
from Eureka with 160 passengers. The
"Westport, in ballast, left here Sunday
for "Westport. The vessels met at a;
print about seventeen miles northwest
of Point Reyes at 1 o'clock yesterday
morning.
The Fea was calm, but a heavy fog
hung over the water. According to the
Ftories told yesterday, the watch on
Â«ach boat was aware of the other ves
sel's approach. Whistles were blown,
danger signals sounded,, voices rang out
in the night and then came the crash.
The Westport, head on, struck the Po
mona amidships, and only the steam
er's stout guard prevented the schooner
from cutting through her plates. As it
was, the Westport got the worst of it.
Her whole stem was driven in and some
of her planking damaged. A forward
bulkhead saved her from sinking.
Before the Westport's stem caved in
it had cut through the Pomona's guard,
bent three or four of her plates and
smashed an awning stanchion on the
upper deck. The denting of the plates,
blight as it seemed from the outside,
cracked one of the Pomona's ribs and
so twisted the Joinery of one of the
staterooms that two women passengers,
awakened and scared half to death by
the jar, found the door of their room
tightly jammed. In the confusion that
followed the collision their screams
were not noticed, and by the time the
Pomona's crew had broken down the
jammed doors the women were in a
state of collapse. They soon recovered.
however, but refused to return to their
t-tateroom.
CONFLICTING STORIES.
The stories told by Captain Smith
Â¦ .of the Westport and by Captain Swan
isoa Â«Â«f the Pomona differ in many ma
â¢tfrtal points, and not until all con
Â¦cerned have told their tales to the
United States inspectors will it be pos
*" EiMe to place the responsibility.
According to Captain Smith, the
â¢\Vostport was backing at full speed
when the vessels collided. If this
t-'i'ty is true the Pomona must have
been traveling sideways at a high rate
ot speed. But Captain Swanson of the
â¢ ".Pomona declares that to escape the
danger that threntened he was going
'full speed ahead. In this event, say
tht- marine surveyors, the Westport's
stem should have been twisted side
*ways and the Pomona's side raked
n:id ripped for half its length. The
Eolles and Bulger sypiem of question
ing:, however, can be depended upon to
' eliminate inconsistencies and out of
the confusion to bring a plain, un
varnished tale.
The Pomona stood by the Westport
until it was ascertained that the
sfam schooner was not leaking seri
ously and was in condition to take
care of herself. The Westport re
turned here for repairs. The Po
mona is owned by the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company and the Pollard j
Steamship Company owns the West- j
port.
MAGGIE IS FLOATKD.
The little schooner Maggie, whose
skipper tried to make port Sunday
night by steering a course across
Golden Gate Park, was towed off the \
beach below the Cliff House yesterday
afternoon by the tugs Relief and
Dauntless.
The Maggie draws little water and
between where she lay wedged in the
sand and deep water was a wide
stretch of shoal. In trying to save
the Maggie the tugs Defiance and
Dauntless got into difficulties them
selves. Each towboat got a line in
her wheel and both drifted ashore.
The tangle in the Dauntless' propeller
was quickly cleared, however, and her
vheel once free it was the work of a
few minutes for the Dauntless to work
herself into deep water, where she
toon pulled the Defiance after her.
She towed the Defiance to her berth
at PacSc-street wharf and returned
' with the relief to the work of drag
ging the Maggie from the beach. This
v.as accomplished about an hour be
fore high tide and within a few days
the Maggie will be able to resume her j
journeying between here and Half- i
moon Bay. j
Hope of saving the Drumburton has i
been abandoned. The stranded ship
will be stripped of everything mov
' able and her skeleton left for the win
ter storms to bury in the sand. Cap
Â¦ tain John Metcalfe, representing
â¢Lloyds', and Captain Albert F. Pills
bury, surveyor of the Board of Marine j
Underwriters, visited the wreck yes
terday In company with Captain John
Barneson. the managing owner.
They found the vessel solidly plant
ed on the rocks with four huge holes
â¢ in her bottom. Captain Barneson for
mally turned over the wreck to the
representatives of the underwriters
a.nd thev see no chance to save her.
On the Atlantic and at some Euro
pean ports are maintained wrecking
plants capable of saving the Drum
burton. but- there is nothing of the
sort on this coast and a $40,000 ship,
standing In her grnve proudly as ever
*he bore herself afloat, must be aban
doned.
. Captain Thomas, his officers and
;>.':rt of the crew are still on board i

We are surprised to learn that Emperor William objected to

A society of temperance workers in Connecticut recently sent
an unavailing protest to the Navy Department against the breaking
of the proverbial cold bottle at the christening of the battleship de
signed to bear the name of their State. They may at least take com
fort in the reflection that this good wine, so sensibly spilled over a
battleship's prow, will be paid for by the builders of the vessel.

SUMMER FRECKLES,
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS â
Subscriber, City. Congress was given
power to determine when the States
should choose eTectors and appoint a
day on which these electors should
cast their votes.. The constitution
stipulates only that the day shall be
the same in all the States. Under this
power Congress fixed a date in 1792
when elections should be held, but in
1845, January 23, the law was amend
ed and the time fixed as the first
Tuesday after the flr3t Monday In
November on which to hold a general
election.
If his Imperial Majesty Nicholas, Czar of all the Russias, grants
a constitution and "liberates political prisoners to signalize the birth
of an heir, who can gauge the measure of his magnanimity when he
will celebrate the cutting of the Czarevitch's first tooth? He may
even grant to the Mikado the privilege of retiring from the war with
an honorable peace. f^-;". * y ~\
FOURTH OP JULYâ Subscriber,
City. While It is true that July 4, In
dependence day. Is celebrated in every
State of the American Union, in the
District of" Columbia and in ail the
Territories, also In the insular posses
sions, it is net. In the strict sense, a
national holiday, for the reason that
Congress has not declared it such.
There are no legal holidays In the
United States.

TURNING TO BLOODâ Constant
Reader, City. There Is nothing in the
Bible that refers to the sun turning to
blood on the last day. You probably
want to know about what appears in
Revelation. vl:12: "And I beheld when
he had opened the sixth seal, and lo.
there was a great earthquake;" and the

very .refreshing in this, age of dress extravagance..
"When that brother of mine gives a gown honorable mention,' 1
the girl was saying. "I always feel very sure of myself .whenever I
wear it. That's why I take solid comfort in this outfit.
"I rode downtown with Joe the other morning and he astonished
me by saying all sorts cf nice things about my cloXhes. The funny
part of it is that he is always such a stickler for buying swell things
at high-priced shops that I got oft two stations out of my way for fear
I'd tell him the whole story and humiliate him by letting him,- know, how
he had been fooled into praising my little inexpensive home-made gown.
"Yes, I made it myself and it was only 9 cents a. yard at that. It's
fine chambray, too, and such a pretty soft blue, don't you think?
"Then I had the piece of nice linen insertion I had years ago on
something else, and it was just the thing for the front of my shirt waist.
The turnover collar and cuffs I made of a scrap of linen scrim.. Scrim
is cheap, anyway, and half a yard makes stacks of collars and cuffs,
so they cost next to nothing â call it 5 cents a set. ;
"There's 95 cents for the gown AVith collars and cuffs. Oh, of course,
I had to buy a pattern to make It by. .That was 20 cents; so there's
?1 15. ." . ! - â¢
"My hat I picfted up on a bargain qounter the other day. There
was a pile of "them, and by taking the trouble to hunt, a little I
found just the shape I wanted in this rough black strav/â all for 25 cents.
. â¢ "At the ribbon counter they made me the big black taffeta bow
four yards, at 19 cents a yard, which is all the trimming the hat needs
âso there's my millinery for $1 01. - .'
"My belt is a 50-cent one. A yard and a half of neck ribbon was 25
cents. So there you are, exactly $3 66 for the entire'rig r of hat, gown
and accessories. I feel comfortably . proud of the style'" that at that

"I should think you would," replied the girl's companion. "If I had
been in your place. I would have gloried in telling him how cheaply,; I
had done, it -all. They do say, you know, that the reason so many, men
stay, single nowadays is because we girls are so extravagant. Now,
perhaps, we ought to let them into the secret of how little pretty'clothes
cost sometimes. It would be a sort of encouragement for - them to
marry."
- "Not much!", replied the girl in the scrim and chambray. . "In that

T""* HE visit of the Secretary of the Treasury to the Coast has had
I a wholesome effect upon politics. This is not because any
*Â¦ thing was needed to insure the West for President Roosevelt,
for that is settled already. But the Secretary of the Treasury, being
the fiscal officer of the Government, and the one best able to speak
for its revenue policy, can speak for the administration of which he is
a part, to the people who want to hear.
The typically American career of Secretary Shaw has put him
in touch with all of his fellow citizens. He knows how public poli
cies aft'ect the farmer, the mechanic, the laborer, the manufacturer,
the merchant and the banker. He knows, also, that a right policy
synchronizes all of these interests, equally distributing the benefits
and the burdens of government.
This is his first campaigning in California, though not his first
visit. He was here to meet and greet the Fifty-first Iowa, as Gov
ernor, on its return from the Philippines in 1899. The Call has had
frequent occasion to commend his speeches and addresses in the
East on political and financial subjects. He has succeeded in reach
ing the business men of the country with the conviction that the
policy which secures such a domestic and foreign market as affords
constant and well paid employment to American labor is the best
policy for the country. As a champion of the business policy. of his
part}' he is strong and clear, and his visit is highly appreciated by
the whole Coast. This appreciation is not confined to party lines,
for thousands, in the nominal opposition, are actual supporters of the
side of which Secret an r Shaw is such a clear and excellent exponent.

SECRETARY SHAW'S VISIT.
To Man She May Marry Smart Girl
Doesn't Reveal Secret of Little Cost
of Her Pretty Home-Made Clothes
Here is the description of a particu
larly pretty linen gown which was
noticeable for some distinctive features
as regards construction. It was car
ried out in natural colored voile of the
openwork etamlne weave and of quite
a lightweight quality and the short
little jacket* vvps handsomely trimmed
with a very heavy make of ecru lace
of openwork design, the pattern being
picked out in white thread. As to the
jupe it was quite a complicated affair
and well worthy of description. It was
quite short, as is always the invariable
rule with the linen gowns of to-day,
and reached to about four Inches above
the.waist line, describing thereby what
is known as a corslet skirt, and the
upper part was adorned with rows and
rows of gathers, which were introduced
in reality on a species of yoke. Below
this the skirt formed Itself into deep
pleats on either side, which were
stitched securely down half way.
PRETTY' LINEN DRESS.
The newest automobile suits are of
leather- â that is, those costumes have
been recently imported from Paris. A
leather suit certainly seems more sen
sible for the purpose than anything
else yet thought of, for not only .will
leather keep out the sharp wind, but
it is also absolutely dustprbof.
Most of these leather costumes are
lined with heavy flannel or cloth, or
again of silk or satin warmly inter
lined with chamois or flannel. For
the summer, however, a silk lining
would be all sufficient.
The coats are long, or coming just a^
trifle below the hips. Many are made
with the full box back and loose front,
but the rather tight-fitting Norfolk
jacket, belted in at the waist, is per
haps more sensible. ' Whatever style is
followed, the collar is 'always buttoned
tightly at the throat, and the sleeves
should be fastened with a cuff at the
wrist For the Norfolk jacket straps
of leather are used just as the cloth
straps on a coat of that material.
FOR THE JOUSEWIFEi
The waxed lining paper to cracker
boxes is excellent to wrap around
small cakes and loaves of bread. 1 It is

Experiments, the world over, show that land requires about
three feet of water during the growing season to produce a crop.
This is averaging all absorptive conditions of the soil and all rates
of evaporation. Italy, in the valley of the Po. has long^established
a scientific irrigation, and the average duty of water is one cubic
foot per second to about sixty-six acres, in continuous flow. But
Italv on the same land has a rainfall of between thirty-five and forty
inches, of which twenty-two inches falls in the season of growing
crops. So the irrigated land of Italy gets about 130 inches of irri
gation water and twenty-two inches of rain, or a little over tv.elve
feet in the season of crop growth.
Oi coarse we Lake Mr. Lippincott in his Yuma illustration to
mean that a miner's inch in twenty-four hours is distributed over a
crop season of ninety days, or 86,400 cubic feet in three months, or
fifteen inches to produce a crop. We refer to the subject again
because many practical irrigators, who are aware that the world has
passed the experimental stage in which many Government engineers
seem to linger, take the view herein expressed, and its publication
may enable explanations that will set them right, if they are wrong.
As a word of caution, we have to say that it will be far wiser
and safer for the Government engineers to underestimate the duty
of water than to overestimate it. Federal irrigation is a large and
serious experiment. It is in politics with the approval of both par
ties, and the failures and disappointments likely to attend it will be
mitigated by moderation now.
MOVED by a desire to dispel illusions before their indulgence
causes loss and disappointment, we recently deprecated cer
tain harmful fancies in irrigation, indulged in by some of
the responsible people in authority in the Federal irrigation enter
prise.
One of these fancies related to the service, or duty, of water, the
quantity allotted to a given area of irrigable land. It had been stated
by one* of the engineers in charge of the Federal work in Nevada
that a miner's inch would irrigate 500 acres o_f land. We regarded
this as an unsound position and gave our reasons. Mr. Lippincott,
another Federal engineer, supported our position, but doubted, in
the absence of proof, that such a statement had been made. But it
was made. It was not advanced as a mere theory, put forward in
an academic discussion, nor was it expressed as a hope, or used
for illustrative purposes to illuminate an hypothesis. It was sworn
to as a fact, stated under oath.
As Nevada was the scene of the litigation during which this
occurred, the matter is invested with some interest, because the
engineer who made the statement under oath is in charge of the
Truckee River project for the Government in that State. The "Big
Meadows" around Lovelocks, in Nevada, were brought under irri
gation and fine production, by using the water of the Humboldt
River. Others settled in above these first irrigators, and proposed,
by building a dam, to take all the water of the river,, denying any
right thereto by the prior appropriators at Lovelocks. But the prior
appropriators fought for the fertility of their fields, and in the ar
duous litigation that followed this engineer was the expert employed
by those who proposed to despoil them. He sought to show that
the first appropriators were using more water than their land re
quired. Basing his testimony upon his own observations at Fresno,
Cal., he testified that in the hot and dry climate of Fresno
and on sandy land one miner's inch efficiently irrigated 500 acres of
land. When similar litigation arose in Churchill County, Nevada,
testifying against the rights of the prior appropriators there, he
made the same statements.
These things are remembered in Nevada, and by the attorneys in
the cases, some of whom are in San Francisco. The prior appro
priators won their cases in the Federal courts. But the testimony of
the expert engineer that one miner's inch serves 500 'acres of land
became the inspiration of theoretical irrigators, and their case was
strengthened when the engineer who verified by his oath such an
extraordinary service 'of water was put. in charge of the Govern
ment work. This is the origin of the entirely inflated expectation of
the amount of land that will be irrigated in the arid region by the
available water supply.
A leisurely examination of the estimates' made by Mr. Lippin
cott. in his letter to The Call, seems to reveal in him a leaning toward
the side of undue expectations about the service of water. He quotes
conditions at Yuma and in. the Klamath district. His allowance for
Yuma, if we understand him correctly, is 680 cubic feet of water per
acre, which is not quite three-sixteenths of an inch per acre. That
is a very thin sheet of water to spread upon land, in a region where
the evaporation is twelve or fifteen feet per year. We doubt very
much whether it will sustain growing crops. If he mean that a
miner's inch flowing constantly for ninety days will suffice for an
acre and a half we have this result: In an acre and a half are 65,340
square feet, which a miner's inch in ninety days would cover about
fifteen inches. He allows eighteen inches at Klamath for^the crop
season, against fifteen inches at Yuma. But the record of thirty
six years' rainfall at Yuma shows an average annual precipitation
of three and four-tenths inches only, while at Klamath it is thirty
six to fifty inches.

It was announced from Constanti
nople, September 2, that a fierce fight
between Armenian insurgents and
Turkish troops had occurred at Van
August 31, in which more than a score
were killed. â¢ About one hundred and
fifty Armenians raided the town, cap
tured four houses and barricaded them
selves. Troops attacked the houses and
in the fight which followed two soldiers
and twenty other persons were killed.
The authorities set fire to a number of
adjoining houses . so -. that the troops
might be- better enabled to besiege the
'insurgents. It was said by the author
ities that other "Armenian bands were
preparing to cross the Persian frontier.
Mrs. Foxen was busy In the kitchen
of her home when the accident oc
curred. No one knows exactly how
the shot was fired, the boy being so
prostrated that he could give no mora
than an Incoherent account of what
happened. It la generally supposed
that the youngster was cleaning his
rifle when it was discharged.
Mrs. Foxen was removed to the Cot
tage Hospital and after two hours
breathed her last without having re
covered consciousness. It was found
that the bullet, 44-callber, had en
tered the left side and passed through
the liver.
SANTA BARBARA, Sept. 5. â One
of the saddest accidents that ever oc
curred in this city happened shortly
before noon to-day, when Epifanio
Foxen, a boy of 10 years, shot his
mother, death following in about two
hours.

It was reported that of the 52500 needed

$1600 had been raised. Of the $3200
wanted for the Girls' Rescue Home

In the government the only â¢ Idea of the
official, big or little, ie graft. From the high
est civil officer In Peking down to the lowest
tax collector in eome faraway district, the-
Idea is to squeeze money cut of the common
people. But it Is the common people who are
turning to Christianity. They learn that there
Is liberty and security In the faith of ChriK
and it is their only hope here and in the world
to come.
TfcÂ« social and political past of > Chin* Is
bejted en the devil. The Chinaman know* no
spirit except a devilish one, and everything In
the whole empire seems to be' along* these - di
abolical lines. The gods - they worship " are
of the under world and their prayers are for
the purpese of propitiating- the spirits of dark
ness. If a rich man dies his money Is used,
to buy Immunity from punishment in the abode
cf darkness and to build temples to the devil
gods on earth. It is stated in- China that it
cost Ld Huns Chang, the greatest grafter In
all the Flowery Kingdom, a sum- equal to a
quarter of a million to get on the good eide
of the. chief flend In hell. The practical natur
al religion of the Chinese is eatanle worship,
pure and simple. Bven the boasted venera
tion of dead ancestors is for the purpose of
pleasing the spirits of the departed and mak-.
ing them useful advocates at the court of the
Great DeviL .. . . .
There were two interesting minis
ters' meetings on Monday â that of the
Occidental Board of the Presbyterians
and that of the West Side Christians
at their church on Bush and Deyisa

The meeting of the West Eiders was
made particularly interesting by an en
tertaining paper by Rev. I* O. Fergu
son of Fresno cm the imperative, need
of doctrinal teaching and by. an-ad

MORGAN QUITS
BANQUET HALL
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 5.â The Im
perial ukase extending the rights of
! residence and to engage in industrial
| and commercial pursuits to the higher
j class of educated Jews meets with favor
both in the pro and anti Jewish press.
The Novosti, as spokesman for the
Jews, hails It, together with the speech
of Prince John Obolensky, Governor
General of Finland, declaring that It is
the purpose of Russia, not to destroy
Finnish rights, as meeting in a tran
quillizing sDirit the two burning ques
tionsâthe treatment of the Jews and
the frontier problem. It says the ukase
ends the intricate and vexatious re
strictions against the Jews -introduced
by .General IgnatiefC when Minister of
. the Interior in 1882, and concludes with
expressing the hope that It will be fol
i lowed by the removal of the restric
1 tions which have cut off the Jews from
higher education. ,
The Novoe Vremya, anti-Jewish, in
calling attention to the opening words
of the ukase â "having found it just to
Introduce certain changes prior to a
general revision of the laws affecting
Jews"â says it shows the privileges
now conferred are but the commence
ment v of the removal of various re
strictions on .the Jewish -race, and ex
presses the hope: that the Jews in. their
turn will demonstrate thejr, ability, to
gradually assimilate Â¦ themselves with
the native- population, and not make
the privileges conferred i on them .the
means of oppressing j the common peo
ple, adding:" "Persons who enjoy au
thority among the Jews should exert
all their influence'j'ln converting their
coreligionists into worthy citizens."
PARIS, Sept. 5.â A dispatch to the
Temps from Constantinople, by way of
Sofia, says that an official report which
haÂ» reached one of the foreign Consuls
there states that Armenian insurgents
at. Van, Asiatic Turkey, are success
fully resisting the Turkish troops,
which until yesterday had been unable
to reduce or disperse them. The Ar
menians advanced, to within about four
hundred-yards of the French consulate.
The population of Van is seeking
refuge in the schools and convents. It
is expected that Turkey will mobilize
the Fourth Army Corps and draw
troops from Asia Minor in order to sup
press the uprising.

When Mildred Hopper, a comely sirl
- of 18 years, took her awn life by swal
lowing an ounce of carbolic acid early
yesterday morning: the secret of her
trouble with th<? world, or Its fractions,
died vrith her.
Shortly after midnight Mildred re
turned from & party. This was the
etcry ehe told her mother. There was
a eharj> word of rebuke and the girl
retired to her room. At about 5 o'clock
In the morning Mrs. Hopper heard her
daughter calling "Mother! Mother!"
The eound Earns from a she I In the
back yard. Mrs. Hopper hurried to the
rear door of the house and called: "Is
that you, Mildred?** The answer came,
"Tea, mother; I un dying; I have
taken poison." One hour later the girl
was dead,
Mrs. Hopper cays that tvhen her
' daughter came home Bhe met her at
the front door and reprimanded her
for etaylng out late. This was not the
f-rst time the parent had had to call
her daughter's attention to the impro
priety of remaining out till midnight,
Â¦but as Mildred explained that she had
been to a party in the neighborhood.
Mrs. Hcpper thought no more of the
matter.
The young woman had left her home
at 1221 Mission street early on Sunday
evening, saying that she had an en
gagement with friends to go down town
to 6ee the electric illuminations. About
1 o'clock In the morning she returned
and "was met by her mother, who had
become anxious because of her ab
sence.
John Hopper, father of the girl, is
a chemist, and on a shelf in a rear
â¢ room he keeps a number of drugs,
among which is a large bottle of car
- bolic add. Mildred must have swal
lowed a mouthful of the poison from
"the bottle and then gone into the shed
to die. Her actions must have been
on the spur of the moment, for the
girl's throat and neck were badly
burned by the acid, showing that she
had hurriedly taken the poison, spilling
much of it in her haste.
Medical assistance was summoned by
Mr?. Hopper, but antidotes failed to
pave the foolish prirl and she died at
â¢ â¬:25 a. m. Undertaker H. F. Suhr was
Furr.moncd and shortly afterward the
Coroner â¢was notified and the body re
moved from the undertaking parlors on
Mission and Eighth streets to the
Morgue.
Mrs. Hooper when questioned about
the case said: "I do not think that
there is any reason to believe that my
daughter was crossed in love. She was
a srirl of peculiar disposition and in
clined to be morose at times. I did not
Â¦ sneak harshly to her, but simply told
ber that I wanted her to keep better
hours. I think that she committed the
fash deed in a moment of temporary
ir.F.inity."
Tho Morgue officials were unable to
"l^arn that any party had been given in
the neighborhood of the Hopper home
on Sunday evening.

The husband of an Ohio woman
brought home some packages of Grape-
N'uts one evening and there was much
iifcuEsicn, but let her tell the story.
â¢'Two years ago I was thin and sickly
and suffered 6o from indigestion, was
very nervous, and could not sleep at
iMgrh't. I was not able physically or
mentally to perform my duties and
was constantly under the care of our
Â¦ physician. I had tried plain living and
ail the different remedies recommended
by friends, but got no better.
"One day my husband brought home
two yellow boxes and said. "The grocer
wants us to try this food and report
how we like it; he thinks it will help
you.' I read all It said on the boxes
about Grape-Nuts and I remember how
I laughed at it, for I thought it fool-
'.rh to think food could help me. But
the next meal we all ate some with
cream, We liked It and enjoyed the
deliciously crisp and new flavor, so we
kÂ«?pt on usir.g Grape-Nuts, not because
we theusret it would cure me, but be-
cause we liked it.
"At that time we had no idea what
the rc-suJts would be. but now I am anx-
ious to have the world know that to-
day I am a well and strong woman
rhys'.cally and mentally. I gained over
20 pounds, do not suffer from any of
the old ails, and I know that It is to
<; rape- Nuts alone that I owe my re-
stored health. They call me 'Grape-
Nuts' here in the home and all of my
friends have asked me the cause of
.'t all. I have persuaded several of
â¢them to use Grape-Nuts and every one
"rf them who has done eo has been
bÂ« nefited and I wish it were in my
pov.-rr to induce every one who is sick
to f:\t- this wonderful food a trial.

Rev. T. S. Lcland, pastor of the Victor
Methodist Church, who was arrested
a week ago and charged with assault
to murder, conspiracy to murder and
assault with a. deadly weapon, has
been released on bonds. Rev. Mr. Le
land immediately started by the first
train to Pueblo to attend the anuual
Methodist Conference. A message
from Pueblo "states that he has been
received most cordially by all the
brethren at the conference.
It was at Leland's house that two
men, resisting intrusion, shot several
times at Sheriff Bell and deputies.
Minister J.cland Leaves Jail to Attend
Methodist Conference.
RELEASED OX BONDS.
It was admitted to-night by Sec
retary Tracoy of the Allied Trades
Council c-f the unions on strike that a
message opening up such negotiations'
had been delivered to-day to represent
atives of the packing firms by W. E. !
Skinner, general agent of the Union
Stockyards and Traction Company,
acting as a middleman.
According to the plans to-night, an
answer is to be submitted to-morrc-w

ported at a special mreting of the Al
lied Trades Council. This meeting has
been called for early in the forenoon.
Special meetings for all the local unions
involved in the strike have been called
for to-mc-rrow. If the packers give
assurances to the strikers, messengers
will be sent at once to the gatherings
of the local bodies. The unions, it is
said, will then vote on discontinuing
the strike and their referendum vote
will be reported at once to the meeting
of the Allied Trades Council.
CHICAGO. Sept. 5.â The indications
to-day are that the stockyards strike,
began over tv.o months ago, will be
called off within twenty-four hours.
Through the medium of a middleman
negotiations were begun in an effort to

as a basis of abandoning the strike to
morrow. ' . '

Young in Great Form.
Play was resumed in the coast cham
pionship tournaments at San Rafael
yesterday. Matches In both singles and
doubles were played, and many of them
were close and Interesting. The match
in which most Interest centered was a
doubles, in which Miss May Sutton,
the national champion, played -with
Miss Mynta Seymour and against Miss
Florence Sutton and Miss Dobbins.
The champion* and her partner .-were
beaten* two sets out of three. Miss Sut
ton and Miss Seymour won the first
set, but in the next'two their opponents
by playing a majority of the balls to
Miss Seymour won out. The little
champion tried hard to ward off defeat,
but the support accorded her. by her
partner was . hardly good enough to
beat two such clever players as Miss
Florence Sutton and Miss Dobbins. Miss
Seymour played a good game, but had
too much to 'dol
. In the women's singles there was a
surprise in store for both spectators
and players. This- was the defeat of
Miss Dobbins, the strongest- player from
the south aside from, the Suttons, who
was beaten by Miss Ethel Ratcliffe of
Berkeley. After winning the first set by
an 11-9 score. Miss Dobbins became
tired and went down to defeat before
the steady game of Miss Ratcliffe. Miss
Dobbins outstroked Miss -Ratcliffe, but
the latter got everything back and
made no errors. Steadiness undoubt
edly won for Miss Ratcliffe.
In the men's doubles there was also
a surprise. Trowbrldge . Hendrick and
Simpson Sinsabaugh, the Southern Cal
ifornia champions, were beaten In a
five-set .match by Robert Variel and
Claude Wayne, also of the south. At
the end of the first set, which Hen
drick and Sinsabaugh won rather eas
ily, Sinsabaugh fell heavily and injured
his ankle and wrist. He was hardly
able to hold his racket after this, but
finished out the match. But for this
accident the losers. would probably
have won, although Wayne and Variel
certainly played great tennis.
Sinsabaugh -had his arm in a plaster
of paris cast In the afternoon and had
to default toBozart In v the singles. He
looked to have a good chance In both
singles and doubles, but seems to be
out of luck when he visits. San Rafael.
Two years ago he was sick throughout
the tournament.
Two " matches were commenced in
doubles late in the afternoon and both
stood two sets all when darkness set in.
In one Whitney and Grlffln were op
posed to Foley and 1 Dunlap, and In the
other Varlet and Wayne were opposed

The Chicago lad was fighting at Buch
close Quarters as to place the Mexican
at a disadvantage. Though Herrera re
peatedly crossed his right on Nelson,
his blows lacked their former force and
seemed to only sting the clever Chicago
man into greater activity and fierce
ness. The capacity of Nelson to take
punishment was marvelous, and ! his
tenacity in pushing the issue with his
swarthy opponent following- a rain of
blows from the Bakersfleld lad called
forth prolonged applause.
-. In the twentieth round Herrera went
after Nelson In. 'a wild {; manner, ' his
blows being cleverly blocked by the
Chicago lad, who sent. in his left and
right to the Mexican's body with'tell
ing effect. The men fought for a purse
of $3500. 60 per cent for the winner and
40 for the loser. â¢â¢
Nelson carried the flght to Herrera
almost without cessation throughout
the twenty rounds. Herrera scored the
only knockdown of the fight, sending
the Chicago lad to. the floor witha hard
right on the jaw,.. and Nelson r took the
count to nine. Under the. rules Herrera
was obliged to return to his corner, and
before he could get at Nelson again the
latter had recovered partially from his
dazed, condition and' was able to block
the rain of blows the Mexican' waJs"
swinging wildly at'hlnv *
, Herrera in his frantic efforts to .land
a knockout, dropped his guard and Nel
son, with a right "swing, caught I the
Mexican on the side of the jaw, stag
gering him. A rush by 'Nelson then
sent the Mexican up against' the. ropes,
and Nelson, although groggy himself,
appeared to have the dark-skinned
fighter dizzy. The gong saved a knock
out, though honors were" even, both
men retiring to their corners with an
unsteady gait. â¢ \- i. -."'"'
BUTTE, Sent. 5.â -After twenty
rounds of the fiercest milling ever wit
nessed in this city, Battling Nelson of
Chicago before 10,000 persons was this
afternoon given the decision over Au
relio Herrera, the Mexican.. From the
tap of the bell for the opening round
the two feather-weights waded into
each other hammer and tongs.

speedy filly, Tokalpn, won the Twen
tieth Century handicap at Harlem to
day in 'a gallopj, beating Huzzahisix
lengths. Miss Crawford was third. ..
The stake was worth $6820 to the
winner, having a given value of $7820.
The time of 1:58 2-5 is within- a second
of the world's Â¦ record. Tokalon's race
was a brilliant performance. She took
command at the first quarter and led
by^ three and a half-lengths down -the
back .stretch. At the first six furlongs,
which Tokalon , covered in 1 :12 3-5, the
filly had a lead of six lengths. As she
swung into the stretch from where the
field had started, she led by four
lengths," having run the mile in 1:38 2-5,
Huzzah, apparently hopelessly beaten
off the first mile, 'closed with . a mar
velous burst of speed and got up in
the final stride in time to get the place

Graham and Schmidt were the men
behind the curves. Each had every
thing that a pitcher needs to buffalo
batsmen. Then faultless support helped
some and good- batting at the right
time did much to bring in runs nearly
every time the Commuters placed men
on the packs.
A fairly good crowd gathered within
the gates of the Eighth-street lot when
the teams faced each other in the sec
ond contest. Oakland got two runs
right off the reel and then lingered for
efven innings ore they started the do
ings once more. Aside from these dis
astrous periods Iberg handed out â¢ the
g-oods in a mystifying manner.
Frar.cks ushered the game in for the
Commuters with a bingle to right field.
Ganley was passed and Dunleavy sac
rificed and they both advanced. When
Sehlafley clouted a torrid bingler
that nearly took Raymond's pins on
the run both Francks and Ganley hot
footed to the pan. The umpire called
Ganley safe, but it was awful close and
uould have worked either way.
The Brownies played good bush
league baseball, but a rotten big league
article. Twice the first man up led
off with a hit and each time he was
fielded out on a double play, Schlafley
to Francks to Streib. Again in the
seventh Nadeau was anchored on first,
but insisted on posing bo long that
Schmidt copped him off the bag a foot.
Ste-elroan immediately followed with a
double and therefore another run was
tossed off and possibly the game itself.
After Schlafley had singled in the
eighth and advanced to second on JCru
ger's out. Doc Moskiman took Streib's
place and brought in the last run with
a swell two-cushion wallop away. out
to the flagpole. San Francisco will en

returns _from the State election in
Arkansas indicate the re-election of
Governor Jefferson Davis, the Demo
cratic incumbent, over Harry Myers.
Republican, by tthe usual large Demo
cratic majority. The Democrats easily
elected their entire State ticket and the
â¢interest centered in the vote in large
towns, where the .regular Democrats
were opposed in many instances by
independents^ . -
LITTLE ROCK. Ark., Sept. 5.â Late
returns from to-day's election show
that Myers. Republican, for Governor,
probably has carried Lafayette and
Little River counties by small plural
ities. Davis, the Democratic candidate,
is running behind in. some of the towns
and cities, but is making large gains
in the country precincts.
John H. Page, secretary of the Demo
cratic State Central Committee, esti
mates that Governor Davis* plurality
will be 6n,000. Chairman Remmel of the
Republican State Central Committee
claims Republican gains in a number
of nrecincts, and if the same ratio of
increase continues he expects Myers,
for Governor, will have a small plural
ity.
After the excitement the people
reached the shore, crawling over the

before. Only in the instance of the
broken pier at Ocean Park was there
any danger. There were hundreds of

not fall all the way to the water, but

Officer Greggains is a native son of
the Golden West and on a California
stock ranch 1 learned to round up and
rope cattle â his training as a life saver
with a riata.
As Warner appeared on the surface
of the water drifting out it was seen
that he was not swimming with his
former vigor.: and Captain Varney
sprang ioto the surf to his rescue. It
was then that .Officer Greggains rode
down on the beach and,, seeing the two
men struggling in the breakers, spurred
into the water/swinging his< riata over
his head. The breakers splashed around
the horse, frightening the animal, but
Greggains' throw was i true, and the
rope settled over the Â¦ swimmer's
ehoulders. Taking a turn of the life
line around the horn of his saddle, he
dragged the well-nigh exhausted
Warner over the swell toward the
beach. The lifeboat's captain, who was
well out from the land, caught- hold of
thp rope â¢ and both men were hauled
ashore.
Michael J. Greggains of the park
police squad is the officer who spurred
h\t horse into the water and threw his
riata out over the breaker as it rolled
in on the beach and over the shoul
ders of the sailor as he floundered
around in the surf.
Warner was much under the in
fluence of liquor and in a reckless
mood persisted, in plunging into the
surf to swim out to where the steam
schooner Maggie lay aground. He had
been up all Sunday night in the life
boat around the wreck and had made
many Monday morning visits to the
beach saloons. Although. Captain
Varney of the lifeboat ordered him
away from the scene of the wreck,
Warner plunged into the breakers and
was soon beyond the reach of the cap
tain's detaining hand. The boat was
high and dry upon the sand, no ves
sel except the stranded Maggie" was
near and the swimmer had that por
tion, of the Pacific Ocean all to him
self. He took the first line of surf
with a neat dive and bobbed up to the
surface outside of the swell. He did
not get under the next line of rolling
water with the same skill,, but was
thrown back toward the . shore and
ccughtby the undertow.
As the man could swim, he succeeded
in pulling up to the surface .again
and prepared to. tackle the third long
wave. He swam for it,' but fared no
better and was hurled over the comber
to disappear . in the..white smother of
foam that marked the break of the
wave.

volve upon the Governor. There are
several applicants already 7 in the field,
and among the most active is J. Cal
Ewing of Oakland, the secretary of the
commission. It is gossip in the political
camp's that leading representatives of
the Republican party will earnestly re
quest the Governor to recognize some
other county than Alameda in making
the appointment. As the board now
stands two of the Commissioners are
from Los . Angeles, and the other two,
together with the secretary, hail from
Oakland. San Francisco is without a
representative, on the commission, .al
though four-fifths of the banking busi
ness of the State is transacted In this
city.
- The managers of the Republican cam
paign are so profoundly impressed with
Secretary Shaw's ability as an advocate
of Republican principles and policies
that they have requested him to speak
in Nevada on his way home. The Sec
retary has consented to address the
Nevadans at Reno on next Friday even
ing.
. A number of years ago; Scanlan
.owned real estate and improvements
at 813 Filbert street valued at that time
at about $17,000, but he lc-3t it about
ten years ago. Since that time he had
been leading; a Micawber existence.
Among his effects is the following letter
from General John A. Logan:
CHICAGO 111.. Oct. 21, 1S79-
To Whom. It May Concern: 1 have known
C. H.' Scanlan personally and hope he may re
ceive the : employment he no Justly deserves
and by which he would be able to turn his
splendid talents to good account. Respectfully,
JOHN A. I-/3GAN.-
The following from the widow of
General Logan reveals the fact that
she herself had been overlooked and
disappointed in a political way: -'...
EN ROUTE TO CITY OF MEXICO.
Jan. 31. 1S0S.
Dear Sir: 1 am very sorry not to comply
with your request- and for reasons that It is
unnecessary to state. I have refrained from
commending any one to -this administration
after the ungracious treatn*>nt of my ron. I
coukJ not 'offend by repeattnK requests for my
friends. Trusting you may be successful, I
am very sincerely.- '
MRS. JOHN A. LOGAN.
Scanlan has relatives in Ballirialoe.
Ireland, one of whom is a Roman Cath
olic priest. Â¦ t ;' â¢
Papers . found in the pockets of
Charles H. Scanlan, who died in the
Central Emergency Hospital yesterday
morning, reveal the 'salient points in
the career of a good man who fought
and. suffered for his country and who
lost a, fortune and died poor and friend
less/ Up to a late 'hoiur^yesterday his
body lay in the Morgue unclaimed. Yet
he had numbered among 'Â¦ his personal
friends General Phil Sheridan, General
John A. Logan and others of equal
standing in the dark days of the coun
try's history, and had letters of recom
mendation from Senator George C.
Perkins, Congressman Julius Kahn,
General John H. : Dickinson and- others
living and dead of more or less local
celebrity.
Scanlan was more than 75 years old.
Age and wounds received in the war of
the rebellion had made serious inroads
upon his vitality. On September 1 he
was struck by a Hayes street car and
knocked J down at the intersection" of
Ma,son and Market streets, receiving
the injuries which resulted in Â¦ his
death.
On the" other "liand the attorneys for
the Chinese charge that the bureau is
autocratic and unfair in its methods
and that because of its unreasoning:
rigidity many Chinese who are legally
entitled to land have been debarred.
The attorneys for the applicant con
tended that, inasmuch as . the immi
grant commissioner is "not clothed with
full judicial powers in". that he has no
authority to compel the, attendance of
â¢wit nesses or punish them for contempt,
the applicant cannot obtain a full and
fair hearing: before the bureau.
United States Attorney Woodworth
said- yesterday:
The Attorney Genera! of the Unlte0 States
hat directs thin office to take exceptions
In every Chinese case that comes up and pro
poic-s to.ado;n vigorous methods to extirpate
the system "f ' fraudulent entries of coolies
tnder the habeas corpus act. My knowledge
of these cases ha* led me to the conclusion,
that not more than one applicant in a hun
dred of these native oases is a. genuine native
of the United States.
â¢ United States District Judge de
Haven yesterday decided that on the
hearing of a habeas corpus matter in
which the applicant is of the Chinese
race and claims to be a native Amer
ican the applicant may introduce what
rver competent and material evidence
he may have to offer, without reference
to the testimony previously introduced
by him before .the immigrant commis
sioner. The case before the court was
that of Quan Bok Him. United States
District Attorney Woodworth objected
at the hearing before Commissioner
Heacock to the introduction of certain
evidence that had not been presented
to the Chinese bureau at the time the
application of Quan to land was being
considered. The contention was made
or. the part of the Government that
the United States Commissioner was
limited to the evidence taken before
the bureau.
