disabled.
CHEFU, Dec IS.â A portion of the Japanese fleet has left for Slnga
lPÂ°*e to Intercept tlie Baltic fleet. A number of Japanese merchantmen have
â¢boca Uchtly armed to maintain the blockade of Port Arthur. As soon as
' the remainder of the fleet has finished needed repairs It will sail In the di
trcction of Singapore. -
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec 18. â General Stoessel's latest dispatches from
Port Arthur were published to-day, but, as given out, do not carry the
etory of the garrison's stubborn defense beyond December 10, thus leav
ing a gap of at least five days between the official word of the military
commander and the unofficial story of Commander Mizzeneoff, which
was given out at Chefu. It is not pretended that the dispatches are .pub
lished In fulL They contain much that is of stragretic interest and mat
ter -which it is obviously Impossible to disclose to * the public. The dis
patches have been in the hands of Emperor Nicholas three days, but their
contents were known to few besides his Majesty and his personal aides,
Pricce Orloff and Count Heyden. who deciphered the dispatches.
The story of the operations, as far as It has been given out, is In
tensely interesting and shows that there was an almost uninterrupted as
sault of the most desperate character from November 20 to December 10.
when the Japanese, aXter losing more than 22,000 men, captured 203-Meter
Hill and were able from that position to shell the squadron in the Port
roadstead.
There the official account ends, but it Is explained that the Japanese do
not occupy the top of the hilL, which is still exposed to a deadly fire from
the Russian artillery. The Japanese are using a plunging fire , from very
heavy guns from behind the crest of the hill, but that this fire is efficient
ly directed is shown by the damage suffered by the Russian squadron. The
Japanese are credited with using 11- inch and 16-inch "mortar and Howitz
ers. The effect of these must be most deadly when turned upon the neigh
boring forts
The public reception of General Stcessel's dispatches as* a whole is not
I bad. Every voice is loud in praise o f General Stoessel's defense of Port Ar
thur, while the authorities assert that the main line of forts has not yet
been broken. The Japanese so far have used every device of, engineering
fkill in making approaches, but, with enormous sacrifices, have been able
0 take only the outer line of defenses.
It is declared the garrison prybably will be able to hold out a consider
able time yet.
A matter of much speculation is why the order to take out and sink the
squadron in deep water was not carried out. The only explanation offered
5s that the crews and guns were drafted ashore and that at the. last mo
ment it was impossible to move the ships under the heavy Japanese fire.
HILL STREWN
WITH BODIES
Japanese Fig tit
With Frenzy â¢
of Madmen.
CHEFU. Dec. 18.â For ferocity and
sustained desperation on both sides,
the struggle for the possession of High
Hill was probably the most remarkable
In the historv of the siege of Port
Arthur â a siese noted for slaughter.
This statement is bared on an interview
â with Commander Mizzeneoff, executive
officer of the battleship Poltava up to
tbe time that vessel was disarmed.
Mizzeneoff, as already told, headed the
party of seven Russians who left Port
Arthur in a sailboat on December 15
and. after extreme suffering ivhile
crossing in a driving snowstorm, ar
rived here on December Lfi, bearing dis
patches which were turned over to the
Russian Consul for transmission to St.
Petersburg. These dispatches, it is un
derstood, consist partly of a statisti
cal report of the effect of the Japanese
bombardments and there is nothing in
them to Indicate that General Stoessel
is without hope that the fortress will
be able to hold out. Commander Miz
zeneoff, who was wounded In the leg
during the battle of High Hill, said:
"Since the Japanese on the 2Sth be
gan their attack on High Hill, which
they call 203- Meter Hill, the fighting
has been continuous. The steep and
tandy slopes of the hill were streaked
and dotted with snow when the Jap
anese began the battle, which was des
tined to fufnish so many deeds of
heroism that they became common
place. There was so much slaughter
that even Port Arthur's war-hardened
\-eterans shuddered at the sight.
"The Japanese were compelled to
clamber up the slopes of the hill, In I
many cases without firing, in the face 1
of one of the most murderous deluges- 1
ever poured from rifles and machine
guns. I was there, and it seemed to me
that flesh ar.d blood would be unable
to stand our fire for a minute. .
ENTIRE COMPANIES FALI*
"The enemy went down in squads
and companies, but always there were
others grimly coming forward. Their
bravery was beyond praise, as was that
of our men. Sometimes the fighting
was hand-to-hand, with the muzzles
of the rifle* at the breasts of the com
batants, the bayonets being used as
swords.
""The sides of the hill were , strewn
with bodies and the snow was crlm- j
soned with the blood of the wounded, ,
some of whom had crawled into it,
seeking In its coldness surcease from
their dying agonies.
"Eventually, as in similar instances
which were to follow, we retired. leav

neighboring forts, notably those of
Liaoti Mountain.

Stoessel Reports
Twelve Days'
Battle.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. IS.âGen
eral Stoessel's dispatches to the Em
peror, which were received on Friday
night, were given out to-day. The first
is dated November 25 and is as follows:
"I am happy to inform your Majesty
that on November 20, after an increased
bombardment, the Japanese attacked
one of the forts on the northeastern
front and leaped with a portion of the
forces on the parapet. They were an
nihilated by rifle fire and the bayonet
and thrown back into the trenches.
Their reserves were scattered by shrap
nel. â¢
".From November 21 '.*** November 23
the enemy violently bombarded the
fort, and in spite of great losses ef
fected by their perseverance a passage
between two forts on the northeastern
front.
"At 5:30 o'clock in the evening of No
vember 23. after heavy firing, the Japa
nese suddenly hurled themselves
against several works on this front and
seized a portion of the trenches, but
they were thrown back by the reserves
after a fierce bayonet struggle.
"They returned to the assault at mid.
night and again occupied a part of the
trenches, but were annihilated by our
bayonets. At 2 o'clock in the morning
all was over, and your Majesty's heroic
troops were able to rest and started re
pairing the damage caused by the bom
bardment.
HEAVY JAPANESE 3X)SS.
"From the 20th to the 24th the Japa
nese lost more than 2000 men. All of
our troops behaved as heroes. The fol
lowing especially distinguished them
selves: Generals Kongdr.-.tenko. Nlkl
tin (commander of the artillery) and
Gorbatowsky. and Lieutenant Colonel
Naoumenko.
[A dozen other officers In lower
grades are mentioned in the dispatch.]
"Bombardment of the town and har
bor continues daily. A number of
buildings have been destroyed and the
harbor has sustained some damage. The
garrison is In ekcellent spirits." <
In another dispatch, dated November
28, General Stoessel said:
'â¢The 26th and 27th were the bloodiest
days In the assaults on Port Arthur.
The attacks began on the night of the
25th against our left flank, near Pigeon
Bay. The first was repulsed with great'
loss to the Japanese. The same night j
the enemy attacked a detachment on |
Panlung Mountain, but were repulsed, .'
as also was their attack on Visokaia
(203-Meter Hill). -
"On the 26th the Japanese began to
bombard and attack fiercely the forts
on the north front and advanced
trenches. The trenches repeatedly
changed hands. .Nevertheless, on the
night of the 26th we threw back : the
Japanese at the point of the bayonet. '
"The enemy succeeded in blowing up
the parapet of one of the forts and be

other fort on the same night they laid

BIG RIOTS
IN STREETS
OF MOSCOW
Many Are Injured in
Revolutionary
Outbreak,
Crowds Clash With Police
From Noon Until . .
Evening.
Great Mobs Move Through the City
tinging and Shouting "Long
Live Freedom."
MOSCOW, Dec. 18. â This city was
the scene of a revolutionary demon
stration to-day from noon till nearly
evening. Probably 5000 persons act
ually participated. Fortunately the
agitators did not succeed in drawing
the worklngmen from the factories
into the disturbance and after many
collisions the police firing blank vol
leys and charging with their sabers,
the crowds finally were dispersed.
Many were wounded and more were
arrested. As far as known, none of
the rioters was killed. One police
man Is reported fatally injured. Many
on both sides were roughly, handled.
. The authorities knew in advance
that trouble was impending and many
houses along Tverskaia street ; 'were
specially guarded. Several squadrons
of mounted gendarmes were concealed
In' thjj; courtyards of houses ready* for
an emergency. The crowds^-began'td'
collect at midday in Tverskaia street,
students, young men and women mix-
Ing with the general public. .The thor
oughfare was soon congested with a
mass of humanity which converged Â£0
Strastnla Square. There 3000 persona
assembled, many armed with clubs
and carrying flags. The crowd, sing
ing, moved toward the palace of
Grand Duke Sergius, the Governor
General of Moscow.
BREAK INTO GROUPS.
The police attempted to block the
street, whereupon the trouble began
in earnest. The crowd broke through
the cordon and one policeman was
knocked down and, it is thought, fa
tally hurt. Battalions of police were
brought up at double quick to rein
force their comrades. Sticks and
stones were freely used by the mob,
and the police, under orders of their
chief, flred several blank volleys, while
mounted men charged, using the flats
of their swords. The mob fought
stubbornly, but finally broke and
sought shelter in the side streets.
Many of the demonstrators paraded
on side streets in smaller groups, wav
ing flags and singing. A crowd of 500
collected in front of the theater,
where revolutionary flags were hois'ted
amid shouts of "Long live Freedom!"
The police were not prepared at this
point and the crowd, gathering. in
volume, moved from the square to
NegHna street and Koominestki
bridge, the chief street of Moscow,
where the police met them. Another
stubborn fight ensued, ending with
three blank volleys and saber charges.
The disturbance continued at Isolat
ed spots throughout the afternoon.
Many shops were turned Into hospi
tals, where the wounded were tempo
rarily cared for.
The workmen held aloof from the
demonstration, . employers having giv
en them warning that any who parti
cipated would be dismissed. ,.
DEMANDS FOR REFORMS.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 18. â The
disturbances were to-day confined to
Moscow. The Socialistic revolutionary
party in St. Petersburg has decided to
abstain from further demonstrations,
many of their leaders having been ar
rested or wounded on December 11
and no further trouble is likely unless
mobilization of reserves is proclaimed
for this city or In the event of the fall
of Port Arthur. Meanwhile a group
of lawyers is collecting evidence upon
which they purpose to institute pro
ceedings against the police for the al
leged ill treatment of prisoners in the
affair of December 11.
A meeting of 404 undergraduate
girls of the medical institute, to-day
passed resolutions of sympathy with
Sasonieff, under sentence to imprison
ment for the murder of Minister von
Plehve. Another resolution adopted
demands liberal reforms. The meet
ing wound up with shouts of "Down
with. autocracy" and "Long live free
dom!" .
At a banquet of engineers to-night
resolutions similar to those adopted by
the Zenistvoists were passed.

PORTLAND, Dec. 18.â A United
States Senator hurrying to Portland as
fast as steam will bear him in order to
prevent his indictment by the Federal
Grand Jury, a Congressman who from
now on will momentarily expect to
learn that he has been indicted, a

to-morrow morning.
In pursuance of an order of Federal
Judge C. B. Bellinger, E issued at â¢ the
time the second land fraud trial v.as
postponed till- next March, the Grand
Jury will convene to-morrow to-con
sMer a vast amount of evidence which
the Government inspectors have been
slowly gathering during the .last two
years. When that, jury is adjourned it

conspiracy, to defraud. the\Unite'd States
of a portion' of the public domain. ' : /
According to Mitchell's announced in
tention, he left Washington to-night for
the ostensible purpose of giving testi
mony before the jury. It is -said: that
there are those who have been convict
ed of conspiracy to defraud who are not
at all satisfied with the prospect of
playing the scapegoat. It is said that
these men have talked to the Govern
ment representatives in an effort .to
save themselves from the terms in
prison that are staring them in the
face.
It is known that at the last session* of
the Grand Jury an indictment of Her
mann was seriously, considered, but the
evidence, was not sufficient to warrant
the action. It is true that Hermann
was not asked to come back to testify
before the Grand Jury, but there is
strong reason to believe that he will be
a subject of discussion in the Grand
Jury room this . week. Irvin Rltten
house, at one time Hermann's private
secretary, is in the city and Is in com
munication with representatives of the
Government. .
In. connection with Hermann is re
vived the story. of the, missing records
which could not be found after Her
mann went out of office. Forty-one
books, or parts of them, in which was
the correspondence of the office, can
not be found. There Is a story that
some time before Hermann went out of
office he directed a clerk to cut certain
volumes in half and that the stubs be
returned to him. The stubs, it is said
were later destroyed. '

ever might have been, done by all of

Atrocious Murder oi
, Young Girl in
Colorado.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Dec*. 18. â
The body of a girl who is believed
to have been murdered, has been
found on Mount Cutler by two resi
dents of this city,, who were survey
ing there. The body was lying face
downward across a log. An attempt
to destroy the features and prevent
Identification by burning had been
rnade. Near the body were found a
few hairpins and an empty bottle that
had contained gasoline, but every
stitch of clothing had been removed.
The woman had light brown hair,
was about 30. years of age, about five
feet six inches. In height and weighed
about 140 pounds. From the appear
ance of the body death occurred about
a week or ten days ago.
The body has been placed in the
hands of Coroner. Law, who will em
panel a jury to-morrow. Detectives
are at work on the case.
The body is that of a girl about 18
years of gae, five feet In height and
weighing about 125 pounds. It bears
every indication of refinement. The
fingers have martys of rings having
been worn, but no jewelry was found.
The head, shoulders and portions of
the breast were badly burned, but the
hair had burned so slightly that.lt was
only partially destroyed. That which
is left is of a , light-brown color and
would indicate that the deceased was a
blonde. The left upper cuspid tooth,
being the third from the center, wears
a gold crown. There is every indication
that the young woman died of poison.
The theory most favored by the officers
is ,that the girl was a visitor, prob
ably, from the East;, that she was in
duced by some man to accompany him
for an outing, and that he killed her by
means of a poisoned luncheon.
A reward for the recovery of . the
girl's clothing or any part that will
lead to' her identification has been of
fered ' by the authorities. A post
mortem examination will be made to
morrow.
Telegrams were sent out to-nlsrht to
the Chiefs of Police of Phlladelohia. St
Louis and other cities, giving a de
scription of the dead girl. Thev were
sent upon. the; theory that the girl was
killed by some person who found that
she stood in the way of valuable prop
erty,or an' inheritance. , .
Near the point where, the body was
found the . officers discovered a card
bearing the name and address of a St.
Louis man . and a prescription blank
bearing the name of Dr. F. Kline

phia; and "the name of Comp. drucrKlst.

Princess of Troubetskoy, arrived ia

but a part of yesterday she availed her

from a seat in a motor car and finished

the city. â
"San Francisco is indeed an interest

tured in my mind," remarked this
bright-eyed critic and writer as sha
reclined in a chair in the lobby of the
St. Francis Hotel last evening? and re
cited her experiences of the day. "Do
you know that it reminds one a bit of
Paris, though your hills quickly dispel
an idea that one is traveling over tha
flat roadways of the French metropolis.
The strongest resemblance to Paris is
found in your business part of town,"
and with this peculiar style of Intro
duction Miss Rives permitted the con
versation to quickly turn to the real
purposes of her presence in the Far
West. " 7, .'Â«-
"I am very eager to find a typical
Western character for- my new story,
which will be a romance of love. I
have got ' the general run of the story
pretty well mapped out in my mind,
but possibly it may be materially
changed before I have finished my trip
over the coast. I had thought that I
might find my character In the person
or persons of several Western farmers,
but when I had visited Butte, Mont.,
and other big Western mining centers
I was not slow in realizing that my
search 'should thereafter be pursued

slender, but with a good pair of shoul
ders, suggestive of ruggedness of the
Western adventurer, who has lived by
his own work- Not a man, mind you.
who Is booted with coarse leather and
slovenly attire, .but a fellow who is
careful of his appearance in so far as
the rough conditions will permit, and
is possessed of knowledge gained by
experience in the field of labor In
which he is employed. In other words
a plain but sensible fellow."
Miss Rives has traveled a great deal
during her short life, and has undoubt
edly made a close study of the men
she has met, for she made some rather
cutting remarks regarding some of
them during her Interview last even-
Ing. Her opinion is decidedly settled
on the point that the wearing of tha
hair long and carelessly arranged does
not always suggest genius, and she la
also firm in her belief that the fop
pishly dressed man is not the gentle
man that many foolish girls are in
clined to suppose.
A CONFUSION* OF NAMES.
Of her most recent production, "The
Castaway," in which Lord Byron la
selected as her leading character â a
story that has received most flattering
criticisms â Miss Rives said that her re
gret was that the public had. for some
unexplained reason, multiplied her
hero and persistently referred'to the
title of the book as "The Castaways."
"I have been frequently annoyed by
hearing the story referred to as "The
Castaways,'" said Miss Rives, "and
have tried In vain to discover how thi.9
mistake had become so general. Never
theless, I have had a high ambition
partly realized in the success of thÂ»
book and have entered upon the task
of writing another story with a great
deal of enthusiasm."
It Is the Intention of the authoress
to remain in San Francisco for several
weeks and then proceed south to Los
Angeles, visiting the various pretty
places of Southern California en route.
She has only recently returned from
an extended trip abroad, where sha
visited all the principal capitals and
gave as much of her time, as possible
to the gathering of impressions of the
people and acqulrinc Inspiration for
future literary work.

Mary C. Bennett, an Omaha woman,
wants to be a widow with the aid of
the law in order to obtain a pension

XO QUARTER GIVEX
"The second and third assaults were
replicas of the first, although the sec
Â«*d was the most ferocious, being near
ly all hand-to-hand fighting, in which
quarter was neiiher asked nor given.
"A remarkable incident occurred in
the third assault- As the Russians,
fctill facing: the enemy, retreated a Jap
anese standard-bearer, holding his flag
aloft, climbed the pinnacle and v fell
dead, clutching the colors. In his
tracks another arose with the colors,
only to- fall instantly with a dozen
wounds in his body. Six others follow
ed and met the same fate. At last,
when the ninth man appeared, a Rus
t^San officer exclaimed:
" *Don"t shoot that fellow with the
flag â it will be planted anyhow?* .
"'The Japanese adopted a curious ex
pedient, which assisted them greatly in
the third assault. They had prepared
huge piles of wood, coal and cornstalks,
which they ignited, the wind being in
the faces qf the Russians. The result
ant lire was immense and the flames
and srucrke compelled the Russians to
retire.
VVOlXDliD BClttED WJTil DEAD.
"The red glare from this fire dis
t Iospq a ghastly picture, more infernal
than ever dreamed by Dante. The as
jEtudts thus far had cost the Japanese
easiiy 12,000 men, while our own losses
â were under 2000. The 6ides of the hill
wore litc-ra!ly covered by dead and
wounded. The trenches were rivulets
cif biood and every visible spot was
dyed ctixasoiL
â¢ 'We might retake the hill,' said
General Stoessel, 'but the hill is not
(if sufficient importance to us to justify
further sacrifice.*
'Since then numerous smaller en
â¦-ngagements have been waged, but the
respectability for keeping the Japanese
ircm occupying the hill in force or
from mounting guns thereon has been
left mair.ly to the shrapnel fire from
other forts. Even the Japanese who
sinsiy use the hill to observe the har
bor do so at great periL
"Following the third assault an
armistice of five hours was agreed
upon to bury the dead. In this task
gieat speed was necessary. The Japa
nese undoubtedly made many awful
mistakes and beyond doubt heaps of
bodies containing helpless wounded
were shoveled in masses into the pits
and trenches- The Japanese could not,
owing to the darkness and their fever
ish haste, distinguish between the dead
and the wounded. -' â¢ :
"Scarcely an officer participating in
the battle of High Hill escaped unhurt
and the proportion of young officers
killed was very high."
A Japanese camp follower who saw a
portion of the fighting at 203-Meter
Hill and who arrived here from Dalny
to-day says that Commander Miz
reneoft's description of the fighting is
not exaggerated. He believes, how
ever, that the Russian losses were
heavier than stated by Commander
Mizzeneoff, as the Russians repeatedly
brought up re-enforcements until it
seemed that the entire garrison must
have been Sn that section. The Russian
dead, he says, were indiscriminately
mingled with the heaps of Japanese
dead. The slope of 203-Meter Hill be
ing very steep and smooth, the Japa
nese prepared for their advance by
shelling the hillside. The sheUs in ex
ploding hollowed out foothold?. In
some instances the Japanese found
1/roteetion behind the heaps of their

"Since November 27 the Japanese !

that your Majesty's heroic troops alone

THIRD PACIFIC SQUADRON.
Work on Russian Vessels In the Baltic

LIBAU, Dec. 18.â Work is beine hur

ral Birileff, who has gone to Llbau to

in a letter to the press ha# administered
a rebuke to tfyose naval .officers who
have been engaged in a newspaper con
troversy relative to the auestion
whether Vice Admiral Rojestvensky's
squadron is strong enough to cope with
the ships of Vice Admiral Toko, with-,
out reinforcements. Admiral Birileff ex-'
presses the affirmative opinion on this
point, declaring that beyond question
the Japanese ships have suffered se
verely, as evidenced by the fact that
the Japanese have ordered one hundred
and dght armor plates, fourteen, for
the battleship Mikasa alone. Neverthe
less, he considers it to be absolutely
vital to prepare a third sauadrpn.
should It prove necessary to support, or
replace the second squadron. ' '
The admiral says every day's/ delay
is a misdemeanor and every, week's'de
lay a crime. The business of naval,offi
cers, therefore, he remarks, is to lay
aside their pens until the war is over
and attend to business. There is no'
time now to try to locate the blame
for the fact that Russia's navy was no
better prepared. *
"As a matter of fact," Admiral Biri
leff says, "we are all guilty. If . our
heads are still on our shoulders it is
due to the forbearance of my lone-suf
fering Emperor."

FIGURES COST
OF THE CANAL
Wallace, the Chief Engineer,
Finds That Sea Level Is
Most Expensive * Project
FOUR PLANS POSSIBLE
Estimates Call for Between
Two Hundred and Three
Hundred Million Dollars
WASHINGTON, Dec. 18.â John F.
Wallace, chief engineer of the Isthmian
Canal, has given the House Committee
on Interstate and Foreign Commerce
the benefit of his investigations so far
made regarding the engineering tasks
to be performed in the construction of
the big ditch. Wallace made this ex
planation of the general problem:
To determine the most feasible plan' for the
construction or the canal will require a most
caietul and comprehensive examination,, not
only of. surface conditions, but the sub-surface
must be exolored.
Alter following the valley of the Chagrcs
to Gainboa, the line of the canal follows a
tributary called the Oblepo up the summit of
Culebra. and thence tollows the valley of the
Rio Grande into the Bay of Panama. The sum
mit at CulobravWas originally about three hun
urfad teet above the sea level, and is' the lowest
point in the divide along the entire length of
the Isthmus of Panama. The plan of the
former commission provided for a dam of prac
tically 100 feet in height above sea level, at
Bahia, with a water level of ninety fact -above
Kfu. level. This place was selected oa account
of the fact that at that point the hills on
either njde of the Chagreti come comparatively
close together, being about fifteen hundred feet
apart, and from the surface indications It
seemed a favorable place fox the construction
of a dam. But the indications . are that this
locality would be an unfavorable and expensive
one tor the construction of a high dam.
The first. plan to be â¢ considered, the one es
timated upon by the iormer commission, is the
possibility and probability of a high dam or
proper | foundation for a high dam at Bahla,
upon which depends the advisability of con
structing a high level, canal, with the surface
of the water ninety feet above sea level.
The" second plan under consideration Is a
summit level of sixty feet above sea' level.
Constructing a canal on this plan admits of
two different methods of treatment: First, the
construction of a dam elxty feet above sea
level at Bahia, with two locks of thirty feet,
there being two locks on the western slope;
second, the construction of a dam sixty teet
above sea level at Gatun. eight miles from
Colon, with two thirty-foot locks in the same
vicinity. The adoption of a sixty- foot level
also will render it necessary to construct a
dam at Gamboa, In order tfi provide a reservoir
to accumulate water enough during the wet
reason to furnish water for the summit level
of the canal.
OTHER LEVELS POSSIBLE.
The construction of a dam at Gamboa in
this connection would also control the Chagrea
Hlver, except that it would be necessary tu
provide a safety sptaway by the construction
of a tunnel some eight miles In length through
the divide, discharging -thÂ« surplus waters of.
the Chagres into the headwater* of the Juan
Diaz, or the alternative plan oi constructing
a tunnel four, miles long through the divide,
separating the Chagres basin t rom the head
wiitcis oi the Gatuncillo, a stream that enters
into the Chagres Valley at Gatun. Should this
mtter course be adopted it would be necessary
to â  construct - an auxiliary channel for the
Chagres from Gatun to the aea in order to'dl-
vert Its flood waters into the bay westward of
Colon. . V
The third general plan under consideration
would be the construction of a canal with a>
30-foot level above the sea with a single lock
at Hlraflores, and a single lock at Bahla, or in
the immediate vicinity; the construction of the
Gamboa dam to be required In this instance
the same as In the 60- foot level plan. â  .
The fourth plan would be the construction
of a sea. level canal with a tidal lock at Mira
flores. In this connection It is necessary to
explain that while the mean sea level of the
Pacific and the Caribbean are the same,; high
tide In the Bay of Panama rises ten .. feet
above mean sea l*vel and falls ten feet 'below;
wherea*. ; ! the- flnfWation-.or^ the .. tide, otajthe
Caribbean at ColunMs less than two feeCVTh*
construction of a dam at Gamboa with the
necessary spillways as noted In the previous
Â»'.en would be the same under the sea level
plan as under the 30 or 60 foot level. ~
The construction of the Gamboa dam > would
provide the water supply for the entire line
of the canal, Including the cities of Panama
and* Colon. It also would provide a power
plant ; f6r the generation of electric power suf
ficient to; furnish ample power for the oper
ation of -the Panama Railroad and for the op
eration of any machinery that might be used
In the construction of the canal. It would
require two years to construct this dam and,
roughly estimated. Its cost. Including spill
ways, would be between $15,000,000 and $15,
000,000, not .Including the power 'plant.
GREAT SUMS INVOLVED.
; Asked, by members of the commis
sion for an estimate of the cost of the
various .plans, -Wallace said the best
estimate that could be made at pres
enCwould'be based on the estimate of
the/V former commission of 5200,000,000
forTa, ninety-foot' level canal. Figuring:
with,' this as a basis, the sixty-foot
level- canal would cost $225,000,000, could
be open, for traffic in ten years, and ful
ly completed In. twelve years; the .thir
ty-foot i. level would cost $250,000,000,
open '.for traffic-! in- twelve years and
.completed in fifteen years: the sea
level .canal J would' . cost $300,000,000,
could.be open for traffic in fifteen years
, aridr'cbmpleted in twenty years.
:â¢; The estimate of time- is based on a

MORE FREEDOM
FOR PEASANTS
Witte Iiecommends New
Laws, Which the Czar Ap-
HAILED WITH DELIGHT
Disabilities to Be Removed
and People to Be Given
Opportunity to Advance
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec 18.â M.
Witte, to whom as chairman of the spe
cial committee appointed in 1902 to in
vestigate the question of the better
ment of the conditions of rural enter
prise and to revise the peasant lawS,
was given the task of sifting the enor
mous mass of evidence collected. In
cluding the opinions of 11,000 of the best
qualified peasants, landlords, merchants
and manufacturers, which filled several
thousand volumes, has completed a gi
gantic task. His conclusions, which
have just been published, are in line
with the most enlightened opinionTfor
ameliorating ttie ? *peasants" condition.
These conclusions, which' are under
stood to have the indorsement of Em
peror Nicholas and Minister of the In
terior Sviatopolk-Mirsky, are expected
to be adopted by the commission as the
basis of the new. laws. .
The press hails the memorandum not
only as a signal victory in the' direction
of real national progress, but as mark
ing a definite shelving of the plan de
veloped by the late Minister of the In
terior von Plehwe for extending the
powers of local officers over the peas
ants and increasing, rather than de
creasing, the tutelage exercised over
them. Von PI eh we' s purpose was to
rush through a-Uaw before the commis
sion could complete its labors.
In all points Wltte's * recommenda
tions aim. for the completion 'of the
emancipation act of 1861 by ending tna
treatment of peasants as a class apart,
giving them a method to free them
selves forever from the soil, placing
them on an equality with all other
classes of the population and removing
the restrictions upon initiative enter
prise, which have heretofore crushed
out all their ambition. In order to ac
complish this he proposes to abolish
practically the whole system of laws'
applicable to peasants alone. At the
same time the backward condition of
the vast majority of the peasants and
the fact that If placed on a complete
equality, in the 'matter of the holding
and disposition of property they would
soon become the prey of the shrewder
among them as 'well as of merchants,
who would like to possess their lands
and keep them In a state of perpetual
debt, is fully recognized.
Witte therefore recommends the pres
ervation of'certain laws designed solely
for the peasants' protection, such as
the inalienability of communal lands
and Institutions. For the management
of the one and the, freedom of the other
from debt special laws will be recom
mended, supplemented by methods
whereby peasants may leave, their com
munes under .safeguarded conditions.
or delimit lands for individual owner
ship. There also is in contemplation
the organization of a system of land
credit and a scheme for. the settlement
of state lands by peasants who want
larger opportunities. ,
The Russ remarks: "Like a golden
thread through It all runs considera
tion for the peasant as a citizen of the
empire, and no longer as a patriarch."
The memorandum Is in sharp contrast
with the draft prepared by Von
Plehwe's assistant, Stisklnsky, which
disregarded entirely the opinions so
laboriously collected by the commission.

TO BROWN'S ASSASSIN
Search for Patrolman s Slayer a Blind One
Detectives Believe Him to Be Footpad Who Has Been Hold
ing Up Oaklanders â "Babe" Curtin Arrested.
OAKLAND, Dec. IS.â Mounted Po
liceman George W. Brown, who
v.-as killed last night by a man at
Twenty-sixth street and Broadway,
was the victim of a murderous thug ;
has been operating for a week in
ihls city as a masked footpad. This is
the theory adopted by Chief of Police
Hodgkins and all the detectives who
have been investigating the mystery,
Blnce Brown was shot to death and
died without being able to say a word
that might helrÂ» his brother officers iu
their hunt for the murderer.
The police to-day covered every de
tail of the case as far as the meager
ness of circumstances permitted. The
possibilities of murder for revenge and
of accidental shooting were eliminated
bs being untenable in the light of the
conditions and of the character of the
Victim.
Chief Hodgkins declares that the man
tvho killed Brown was in his opinion
the footpad who held up and robbed M.
C. Hersey at Twentieth and Harrison
etreets a short time before the shoot
ing. This robber, Hersey told the de
tectives, disappeared in the general di
rection of where Brown was killed. The
footpad answers the description of the
highwayman who began his single
handed holdups .by stopping R. H.
Bailey at Nineteenth and Harrison
streets early in the evening of Decem
ber 10. following that night by attack
ing and robbing W. H. Britton at Thir
teenth and West streets. Early
Sunday afternoon J. B. Duarte repelled
a. footpad's assault in East Oakland.
Thursday night Milton Bulkeley was
accosted by a robber at Twenty-ejghth
etreet and Telegraph avenue. Then
came Hersey's encounter last evening.
In at least four out of these five cases
the descriptions given of the prowling
thug by his victims are sufficiently close
to satisfy the police that one man was
responsible for the robberies.
HUXTIXG FOR THE FOOTPAD.
After twenty-four hours of hard dig-
King the Brown murder has resolved
It6elf into a blind, almost hopeless,
hunt for this robber. Every effort of
the department Is bent on this mission.
But there is little evidence at hai.J
that will help. Not a person has been
found that can give a clear description
of the man who was seen to run down
Broadway and v.-est on Twenty-sixth
street after the shooting. H. M. San
born, the florist; Frank Smith, the
etable boy; Donald McClure, the mes
senger boy; J. H. McKay, the shingler,
all of whom saw the fleeing murderer,
can only cay they saw a man's figure.
Half a dozen other witnesses to. the
pistol's flashes were examined to-day,
nut nothing but indefl"<VÂ» str'?.Â«nÂ»r*Â«
were procured from them. The de
tectives are looking for a heavy-aet

JSCEXE AND VICTIM OF SENSA
TIONAL MURDER IN OAKLAND
ON SATURDAY NIGHT.
man of medium height who might be
wearing dark clothes and a slouch hat.
That is the extent of their knowledge
concerning the murderer of Patrolman
Brown.
So far as the police are now informed
the last person to talk to Brown be
fore he was murdered was J. H. Mc-
Kay, a shingler. who lives at, 1059 Clay
street. He was hurrying on his bi
cycle to the Providence Hospital
across the street from where the shots
were fired. McKay detailed to-day to
Detective George Kyte the circum
stances^ as follows:
I was rtdlnp fast en the Ftdewalk when
Brown, whe was mounted on his horse stand
in? at the curb, hailed me. asking me to stop.
I replied that I hoped he would excuse me this
time, as I was In a great hurry., to get to the
hospital, where a friend of mine lay very III.
Drown said I ought to know better than to vio
late the ordinance.
Ky that time I had dismounted and was
crossing toward the hospital entrance with my
wheel. Drown had turned away from me and
I was up on Uie entrance steps when I heard
three pistol shots In very rapid succession. I
raw Brown whÂ«el around and throw out his
right arm as If to grab somebody. I ran over
to where he was reeling, but some one else had
got there and was holding him.
Shortly before McKay was accosted
by Brown Miss May Sullivan and Miss
Flora Alvarez, nurses at the Provi
dence Hospital, walked out of the
building. On their way down Broad
way they met the patrolman, who was
on horseback, talking to a man. Com
ing toward them on Broadway the
young women observed a light/ Miss
Sullivan remarked that It must be a
small automobile. They met a man a
little later riding a bicycle.
CHIEF HODGKINS' VIEW.'
, Detectives v are trying to learn the
identity of .the man whom the nurses
saw talking to Brown. Chief Hodgkins,
after receiving reports to-night from
Detectives Kyte, Quigley, Shorey and
Holland, besides policemen who were
specially detailed, said:
This ie a cold-blooded ' murder of a police
man in the discharge of his duty while trying
to arrest or examine a suspicious -character.
The man who has been holding up citizen*
this last week Is the man who killed Brown.
Brown wa* not a man to make personal or of
ficial enemies. He was particularly quiet and
unobtrusive. In many respects he : was as
sentle aa a woman. Polite and Inoffensive,
he could not have - made an enemy had he
tried.
Unfortunately we are handicapped at pres-
N - '- â  i - â â -â .â â  . â  â  ,
THE , SAN .CALL, - DECEMBER 19, 1904:
ent in the lack of anything definite as to th>
fugitive's identity. There â  is a bare possibll
lty that one faint clew may work out. .but thl:
is not likely from indications to-nlgnt. *
I -As sustaining the footpad-murder
theory,- the evidence of the ; autopsy
performed byv Dr. O. D.Hamlin shows
that the bullet in the lung was fired
by a man standing within several feet
of Brown and took a downward course.
This would indicate that Brown was
standing in the street, on a level below
the murderer who was on the sidewalk.
The ball through the arm Inflicted only
a flesh wound.
Brown had been on the police force
since June, 1901. Before that he was a
conductor on the lines of the Oakland
Traction Consolidated. His home was
with his young wife, his baby" and his
mother at 534 Twenty-seventh street.
The chief obstacle In the way of a
solution of the murder Is the absence
of any statement from the victim.-
Brown's cry of "Murder, murder, I'm
shot," was the only utterance from
him. By the time help was at hanc
the mortally wounded man was unable
to speak. It Is surmised that Brown
had seen a man at the place where thÂ«
shooting occurred because he dis
mounted. A few moments before that
Brown was on his horse, as described
by McKay. But it is only a matter of
conjecture. What prompted the police
man to cross the street after McKay
left him cannot be known.
Captain of Police W. J. Petersen and
Detective George Kyte; made a critical
examination of the scene to-night at
the same hour as the shooting â¢ oc
curred In order to get a clear idea as
to the view that Brown might. have
had of the west side of Broadway when
he stood on the east side with 'his
horse. The conditions tended to verify
the theory the police have adopted.
** Brown's funeral will be held-Wednes
day morning at 10 o'clock from : St. :
Francis de Sales Church. .The ; police
department .will be represented by a
large delegation.
CURTIX ARRESTED OX SUSPICION '.
: There is a strong suspicion in police
circles in San Francisco that the foot
pad who shot and killed Mounted; Po
liceman Brown was Anthony, Curtin,
better known as "Babe'' Curtin, who !
was arrested last.evenlng at the Hall j
of Justice in that city. -It is known that
he was in Oakland on Saturday night

Little to Be Done During
the Week and Adjournment
Will Be Taken Wednesday
HOLIDAY RECESS IS NEAR
Question of Place for the
Inaugural Ball, the Only
Matter to Be Discussed
WASHINGTON, Dec. 18.â The Senata
will adjourn on Wednesday for the
Christmas holidays tihd no business
will be attempted previous to that time.
A large nuraberof the Senators already
have left for their homes to spend the
holidays, and there is an understanding
that immediately after being called to
order on Monday the Senate will ad
journ. until ."Wednesday and that
Wednesday's proceedings will be con
fined ,to the mere formalities.
â  Soon after the ; Senate reconvenes in
January the Committee on Appropria
tions will report the legislative appro
priation bill. | It will be the policy of
the Senate ;to take it, up as soon as
possible and ~,v.to.v have other supply
measures follow speedily-
The.exodus'of members of the House
from the city since the adjournment
Friday indicates that the lower branch
of Congr.ess will be without a quorum
when it meets 'to-morrow. Should this
be the case, and should any member
make the. point on the , floor of the
chamber, the only thing that can be
done is to adjourn from day to day un
til Wednesday, when the Christmas
holiday recess until January 4 begins.
The question of where the . inaugural
ball shall be held is the only matter
of legislation in sight in the House for
the week.. This will come up under
suspension of the rules on a motion
from Representative Morrell of Penn
sylvania. The Senate has proposed the
Pension Office, and the House the Con
gressional Library. There are indica
tions that a deadlock has been reached
on the matter and that when it Is dis
cussed again the Capitol building will
be proposed as a compromise.

MOTHER'S KISS
DOOMS BABES
Expert. Asserts That Thus
Are. the Deadly Germs of
. Consumption Transmitted
DISEASE NOT INHERITED
Generation After Generation
Dies Because It Occupies
the Same Surroundings
Special Dispatch to The CalL
CHICAGO, Dec. 8. â Dr. William E.
Quine said to-day that "if - one-tenth
of the money annually expended upon
the .consumptives of Illinois -were
spent in preventing the disease '- It
would - soon be eradicated. He added
that the next State Legislature would
be petitioned to donate enough money
to place Illinois in the front rank.
.."Consumption la not inherited,", he
said. "Generation after generation
dies of consumption, because- it occu
pies the same surroundings. For in
stance, a woman is ill of consumption
and becomes. a mother. That child Is
not .born' with. consumption..,. But the
mother picks it up'and fondles it. The
germs are upon her lips as she kisses
the child: The germs are transmitted
from lip to lip. That child becomes
contaminated. Consumption was born
in that kiss. --.
"You have seen a mother taste the
food of an infant. She places in her
mouth the spoon which later will be
used by the child.. In this.. manner
also germs are carried, to the child.
â "You have seen a man delivering
Ice in large quantities drag It over
the stone pavement. Perhaps he
dragged, it over. the floor. There was
expectoration upon the pavement and
upon the floor. Later meat was
placed upon that ice. Cold never kills
the germs of consumption. The germs
were transferred to the meat. The
meat was prepared for food and eaten,
and consumption followed.
"Fresh air and sunlight are the
best remedies that I know of. Many
persons seem opposed to these, how
ever. Many go to the trouble of plac
ing cotton in the cracks of windows,
that no fresh air may find its way
into their sleeping apartments.' Many
insist upon having storm doors to
keep out the wind. They are fostering
consumption."

PRETTY WELL
THOTYOU!
That's What We Did Saturday
and Day Before â But
Twelve Others.
The Twelve Not Sold Is What
Is Bothering: Usâ What
Shall We Do?
Give Them Away? No! Not
Can't Do .That, But We'll
Split 'Em in Two.
How can we get rid of six "Weber"
pianos, one "Wheelock" and five "Stuy-
vesant" pianos, the quickest, without
losing moneyâ that la, without lostng
much money?
We have promised to get rid of tniJ
entire "Weber line" before our competi-
tor (who now has the agency for
"Weber," with shipments on the way)
gets his stock in, and we have got to
turn things upside down to accomplish
It -within the next few days, or be
caught napping.
We have six fine and costly Webera,
one Wheelock, . and five Stuyvesant
pianos (all. brand new) to sell within
the next three or four days, and we
have simply GOT to selL We want
cost for themâ factory costâ if we can
get it, but a" few dollars either way
won't hurt much on these few, and we
propose to deliver the goods.
, Just give us a chance, and if you are
in the market for something real fineâ
a "topnotcher"â at_about the price of
a medium grade, then get our cost fig-
ures on a "Weber," for when an aver-
age of J208 is knocked oft the regular
price of Webers, what's the use chas-
ing around after a conglomerate mixed
lot of low-grade new, and second-
hand "Whatnots," ambiguously com-
piled, and described like job lotsâ
what's. the use?
Our Webers. Wheelocks, and Stuyve-
sants â all from the "Weber concern,"
and from whom no inferior instruments
ever comeâ are for sale (fine, fresh and
new) more than $200 below their rank
and class. They can be had on terms
of $50 down, and 515 per month, on the
few that cost us over $300. and all oth-
ers costing us less than that, shall go
at $25 down, and $10 monthly.
.We have in addition to these, four
superb "Schaeffer" pianos (the new
scale) than which there are few finer
made; to sacrifice â yes sacrificeâ to-
morrow, and cost price of either of
these fine Schaeffers will place them
down so lowâ considering their fine
class and grade â that no one can afford
to buy anything in a piano below $300
without first seeing the "Schaeffer."
The Schaeffers sell from $375 to $500â
Just watch us come near splitting them
in two, and in some cases even worse
than that.
Another good make with all modern
improvements, fresh and new (no old
"comebacks." or second-hand pianos
called "slightly used." but new) for $165
on terms of $10 monthlyâ And still oth-
ers on down to $106 â factory cost.
These latter two makes retail always
for. more than twice the prices herrc
quoted â We must unload, that's ali.
and if frankness, fairness and a square
deal mean anything to those looking
for a piano, then you'll find things
right, at 126 Geary â opposite the City
of Paris dry goods store.

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
PROFESSOR HOWISON SAYS
THERE IS A HEREAFTER
Distlnauistiefl Proflessor of Ptiilosoptiu Wonders
Whu Ann Christian Doutits It.
Expounds His Theories and Gives StriRing.. Illustrate
i i T T seems remarkable that a layman should be called upon to make confession of belief
Â£ in immortality in an orthodox church. 1 sincerely do believe in the immortality of
the soul. I do not see how any Christian can doubt it. I speak now as a Christian
believer, though not as a believer who accepts all the historical doctrines of Christianity.
The doctrine of creation I naturally regard as a myth. It is not literally true, nor is that
of regeneration. It>iS not possible to be made good â that is not even within the scope of
divine power." â From Professor Howison's address. \
BERKELEY. Dec. 18.â The announce- {
ment that Professor George H. Howi- j
6on, head of the philosophy department
of tht University of California, would
discuss the "Immortality of the Soul"
before a body of orthodox Christians in
an orthodox church drew an audience j
which packed the auditorium of the ;
First Congregational Church this after- i
noon. So large was the crowd that Pro- j
fessor Howlson said his original plan of I
addressing what he supposed would be
a Bible class and of asking members of
the class to put their perplexities in the
form of questions, which he would an
swer, had to be changed to suit the sit
uation. â¢
For seventy-five minutes Professor
Howison held the attention of the audi
ence, despite the jarring interruptions
occasioned by bursts of Sunday-school
song through a thin partition rrom the
adjoining room. The distinguished phil
osopher asserted his belier in the im
mortality of the soul, chided some sec
tions of the Christian church for failure
to emphasize the tenet and incidentally
declared the story of the creation and
the doctrine of regeneration to be myths
â beautiful symbols, nothing more. He
epoke in part as follows:
1 do not go tu church and cannot say au- <
ihciitaUvely what le the state of mind of the 1
church concerning thr doctrine of the immoc- j
taltty of the soul, but frunt reading journals
which purport to describe church opinion I
chould tay that general faith in immortality
Is weak. ;
OnÂ« whole group of Christians â the so-called !
liberal group â has ceased to believe it. They |
<!o not object. I understand to any member ;
of their body cherishing the belier. but It Is
BOt of their formal tenets of faith. I don't I
know how far tt* tendency to doubt invades
the orthodox church, but 1 suspect largely.
It seems remarkable that a layman shouM
he railed upon to make confession of beli-tt in
immortality la an urthodoik church. 1 stn
t-erelr do believe in the immortality of the
boul. I do not aee bew any Christian can
doubt it. I cpeak now as a Christian believer,
though not c.Â« a believer who accepts all the
hiÂ«oricai doctrines of Christianity. There is
a certain kind of ClirtotLan truth which can
i* stated simply, and which It is time Chris
tians understood to be th'lr faith. That faith
â¢â¢mbraces three features, which are these :
Belief in Ood â an unchangeable and perfect
God.
'Ill* moral rrepcriEibility of each soul, with
freedem and power accordingly.
The immortality of the soul.
CHARACTERISTICS OF BELIEF.
These three things are characteristic of the
Christian religion, and not of any other. AH
<*her religions omit one or mort of these three
things, either doubt the existence of a perfect
and unchangeable God, the freedom of the
will or the immortality of the soul. The union
of these three faiths in one is charactertiztio
of Christianity.
Originally it was my plan to discuxs ques
tions here this afternoon that might be ral*ea
by perplexed or doubting persons. One such
'iu-Fiun has be* n handed to me. It is worded
taus: *
"1 do not know any life phenomena which
are not associated with the performance of
X>hycical work. In the absence, therefore, of
ratisfactory evidence that the ability to per
lorm physical work continues after the death
of the body. 1 find It difficult to believe in
the immortality of the individual human be
ing. Moreover, the Irreversible character of
many physical processes indicates a gradual
approach of the universe to a uniform state
of t*ir,peraxure. In which case the amount of
work performed In any cycle would be zero."
This query. I should say. is not to' the
point. We do not suppose that immortality is
connected with the existence of the physical.
That has nothing to do with immortality, if
Immortality means another world than this.
The question I hav* read savors of science â
the science which attempts to deal with Im
mortality when It has no right to discuss the
tnatter^t-Bcientlfic men should know the limits
of ecienfe. and If they do they will know that
the soul is not an object for scientific consid
eration. .V .:'-.â¢â¢..
In this connection it may be said that not
many understand how extenElve our body 1*.
Our body doesn't stop with our skin. Our bodv
iÂ» commeneurate with thÂ» entire unlverte. fs
in commen with all other bodies. To illustrate,
our bodies are merely doorways or closets
through which each enters Into the ecsmos of
the univer**. All operations of eating and
drinking include the taking In of that cosmos.
Every soul has the whole of nature for Its
body. Thus perception of the universe iÂ» pos
sible â thus it Is that we see the stars, and
thus it Is that there is no Mar so remote that
w# cannot *ee It, If not with the naked eye.
then tie can call In the Intelligent eoul to arm
the naked eye â  â  . -
PROOFS ARE LEGION".
The proofs that our body Is cosmos are le
gion. And so scientific objections to the doc
trine Â«f Immortality are really unscientific â all
rretenee. Science has no richt to go lr.to the
realm of ] spiritual truth. The < province o*
science is to touch thingr that are tangible.
to see things that -are visible and to hear
things thfft are audible.
The msteriallefB Inquiry at this point is.
perhaps, like thlÂ»: "filnce my consclouBneÂ»s
is of the cownle body, if the cosmic body Is
perishable, what becomes of my perceptive fac
ulties, and if that U my soul, what - become*
of me?"
This materialistic view of the matter is not
unnatural. It raises the Question: "Does
consclouÂ«nÂ»>*s depend on the bodyT' It makes
the material world first, the spiritual second:
The Christian should have pasted thl* stage
when he was baptized. I fear, though â  that
much baptism Is merely the baptism of 'water
and Â«pt of the â¢ Â«pirtt. ' Too many Christians,
*o-ealle<!. Â«r* etlll in the bonds of natural
materiallFtn. fearing that we have no existence
bat that founded on the body â founded on the
cossr.os.
What It the Christian's arrument for immor
tality, then? Perhaps It Is in the surrender Ot

Your Nerves
Are the life, the vitality, the energy of
your body.
It is the nerves that cause the heart to
pulsate, the lungs to Inhale* the oxygen,
the brain to direct the motion of every
organ of the body, the stomach to digest
food, the liver to secrete the bile the
kidneys to filter the blood, and the. bowel*
i to carry off the waste. 4
When the nerves of the stomach be-

Professor Jowett, that brilliant doubter, says

Emerson. In his "Essay on ., Immortality,"
which 1 ence heard him read, is confusing-, and
at times disheartening, as one who alms first
at one goal and then at another, now high In
certitude, now low in do&bt, confusing, almost
destructive, finding -that "perhaps our desire
to be with Go4 may be responsible . for belief
In Immortality."
Others, as Comte. have set up humanity as
an object of worship, declaring that, though all
Individuals fall and are extinct, humanity
wins. Whose humanity? If there are to be
no eternal Individuals, how about an eternal
God? What significance ia it for God to live
alone?

THE SAN' FRANCISCO GALL, MONDAY. DECEMBER 19, 1904:
this pointâ the lack of significance in the ex
istence of a solitary Godâ to an audience which
doubtless ,han been taught to believe In the
value and Figniflcance of a God who once was
solitary before creating man. To you, then,
the - significance may; be that he did not stay
solitary-
The doctrine of creation I naturally regard
as a myth. It is not literally true, nor iÂ» that
of regeneration. It is not possible to be made
good â that is not even within the scope of di
vine power. Goodness cannot be created. â  I
accept the tradition or myth of regeneration as
a beautiful symbol. Intended to show the part
divine existence has had in the matterâ as if
God had mad* me over. We are made anew,
are changed by gazing into that image -of
goodness,, from splendor to splendor. â : % > â  . â¢:
'And so in the /same way is creation a'myth,
Intended as a beautiful metaphor by which we
see how we depend for our existence upon God.
In the name way we know that a spirit cannot

being members of a changeless reality of .which
t-uoh realities as bodies are merely conse

â  Nature exisU because we all do exist i, There
Is in the physl:al world something independent

we may say. we know the mountains are older
and firmer than we, but that Is merely because
my solitary existence is inadequate to explain
nature and not because humanity,, of which' I
am a part, is not thus adequate. This . con

We know that we belong in a world of spirits,

ELECTRIC ROADS
ARE BUILDING
Contra <Costa County Get
â ; t ing Needed Iniprp veiiients
in Transportation Lines
CONNECT WITH OAKLAND
franchises Asked For Over
Important Routes Through
Rich and Growing Sections
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
, . ,{ : â¢ 1016 Broadway, Dec. ,18.
Contra Costa. County will Boon be
connected with Oakland by a complete
electric railway system thajt will reach
every portion of that rich and rapidly
growing county. Who is behind- this
electric railway system .is not stated,
but the work- is actually under way
upon franchises that have been ob
tained, while still other .franchises are
being asked for. Up to the present time
the only piece of.electric railroad in all
of Contra Costa County has been a few
miles in operation at Point Richmond.
The work of building the connection
between Point Richmond and Oakland
is already under way. The material is
on the ground,- gangs of men are "grad
ing and laying the rails and it is an
nounced that inside of six- months the
cars will be running through.
At the time work was begun on the
Oakland connection R. H. Latimer, ,"one
of the leading lawyers of Martinez,
filed an application for an electric rail
road franchise to run from Mulr sta-,
tion," on the Santa Fe Railroad in Al
hambra Vajley,* to Martinez, to Pache
co, Concord. Walnut Creek and then
toward Oakland over what is knownias
the 'Fish ranch road, passing through
Lafayette and ending at the Alameda
County line at the tunnel. .
. Whether this is all part of a general
plan, and who Mr. Latimer represents,
he declines to. say. .Who is behind the
railroad construction between Oakland
and Point \ Richmond is another mys
tery. Mr. Latimer merely says he rep
resents people who will go to work at
once. W. S. Rheem, who is the super
intendent of the Point Richmond line
that , is connecting up with Oakland,
says' merely that his road is to be built
to the Alameda County line and to con
nect with the San Pablo avenue line of
the Oakland Traction Company and the
Key Route. Mr. Rheem is the superin
tendent of the Standard Oil Company's
works at' Point' "Richmond, and this
may "furnish some clew as to whom he
represents in the railroad deal. Mr.
Rheem also says it will not be long be
fore. Point Richmond is connected with
Martinez -by electric road. So it would
seem that Contra Costa County is
about to experience a season of rail
road. building such as it, has never
known before. - ; â¢
These lines will- open up a country
that is rich in both. products of the soil
and products' of the mills., They will
connect. the great manufacturing water
front with, the \ rich interior and- will
vastly ..aid >;:the<^.-development ;of ) the
county.- The. growth of;, Contra CoÂ£ta
County has been very great, and. where
once -.were onlysmall landings are now
cities. Richmond has in the . neighbor
hood of r.ooo population, and Black Dia
mond, which was once bid â ; New York
Landing." is now a thriving town. The
Contra Costa Gazette is already agi
tating the advertising of Its water front
and asking for Federal aid : for its de
velopment, and Secretary, Metcalf of
the Department of Commerce and La
bor has called attention to the fact that
Contra Costa County ' Is already the
second manufacturing â  county in the
State. What the county has needed has
been better railroad service, and ap
parently it is at last to have this!

PRISON HOLDS
BOLD BURGLAR
Patrolman Lloyd Bravely
Struggles With Two and
Brings One of Them to Jail
CAUGHT AT THE CRIME
Overtaken fn Meat Market
AV r hile ftoftbing PlacÂ£ Into
â¢ Which Tltey Had Broken
Patrolman E..E. Llovd captured a
burglar last evening In, the meat mar
ket of A. Geantlt at 935 Montgomery
avenue. The . man, whose name, is
James Dillon, alias Brady, was rob
bing the place with; an unknown ac
complice when the policeman came up
on them and interrupted their work.
Lloyd had a desperate struggle with
the men when they tried to make their
escape. One got away, but he clubbed
theother one into submission with the
butt ejid of his revolver.
Lloyd was patrolling his beat when
he discovered that the Yale lock on
the \ side, door had been, wrenched off.
Suspecting that ' a." crime had been
committed tbe policeman entered and
searched tire.' place with his electric
lamp. At this time he was unable to
discover any trace of the burglars, but
when he reached to turn on the gas
and light it, two human forms sud
denly sprang from behind /a counter
and started for the door.
â Lloyd seized each man by the coat
collar and was dragged along by them
through the doorway and into" the
street. Both ' of - the robbers then
showed fight and the policeman did
everything In his j power to subdue
them. Finally one of the men turned
his coat back and caused the officer's
grip to slip. He then dashed down
-Montgomery avenue, but Dillon con
tinued to give his captor battle. Lloyd
drew his revolver and clubbed the
burglar on the head. When the latter
begged' for 'mercy and gave up the
fight he was handcuffed and taken to
the City Prison. In the market were
found a hatchet and a chisel used in
prying off ..the lock, also three large
rocks tied up in sacks which were to
have been used as weapons.
The police have been unable to learn
much concerning Dillon. He attributes
his presence in the place to the fact
that *he was drunk. It is said, how
ever, that he is an ex-convict and
has done time under the name of
Brady. He refuses to reveal the name
of his partner.
Later in the evening Llovd, in com
pany with Policeman Jack Stelzner, ar
rested Thomas Sbarbaro on suspicion
of being the second man implicated In
the burglary. Sbarbaro answers the
description, and it Is probable that he
will be charged.

NEW YORK, Dec. 18.â Protests have
been received by the city officials for
the last few days against a "proposed
city ordinance" requiring all disorderly
women to wear stuffed birds. or feath
ers on their hats. This culminated
when a letter reached the City Hall
from Mrs. Francis W. Graham of Lock

New York. . . . : .â¢
Mrs. Graham's letter said her or

Graham, also said that a fine would be
imposed by the ordinance upon all
women coming within -its provisions
who failed to live up to them.
' "While I doubt the truth "of these
statements," .wrote Mrs. Graham, "as
president of the Woman's Christian
Temperance Union of this Statel write
to inquire if what the "circular states is
correct, and if so to protest against the
enactment of such an ordinance, or of
any proposal to recognize, tolerate or

1016 Broadway, Dec. 18.
-The usual holiday depression in the
Alameda County real estate market
has been but little in evidence during
the past week, nearly all the . local
dealers reporting a fairly brisk busi
ness, in spite of the fact that every
one is preparingforthe celebration of
Christmas. It is expected that, the
coming week will be quiet, as real es
tate dealers are not among the busi
ness men who aÂ»c benefited by the rush
of holiday trade, the heaviest volume
of which generally comes during the
week before Christmas.
The work of the various improve
ment clubs and civic organizations of
Oakland has contributed much to the
prosperity of the year, and to these
bodies is due much of the credit for
the increased sales of real estate in
this city and its suburbs. | At the head
of. the list of the organizations which
have contributed to the prosperity of
the city is the Oakland Board of Trade,
which has been the means of inducing
several large manufacturers to locate
in Oakland during the year. ' Another
of the civic bodies which has been
largely instrumental in bringing about
the general prosperity of the communi
ty is the Independence Square â¢ District
Improvement Club of East Oakland.
Through the efforts of this club ten
blocks of streets have been graded,
curbed and macadamized and more
than 3250 feet of cement sidewalks have
been laid in the last twelve months.
NEW OFFICERS.
At the last meeting of the club the
following officers were elected for the
ensuing term: President, Charles P.
Welch; first 'vice vice president, J- C.

THE WORD'S ' CONDITION*
Dr. H. II. Bell Takes" Optimistic View
of Men and Nations of , â¢ - .
T-~ To-Day.
"The world Is In a great deal better
condition to-day than it ever was."
said the Rev. H. H. Bell; D. t>..' at
the First United Presbyterian Church,
Golden Gate avenue and Polk street,
last night. Dr. Bell's sermon " was
founded on the theme. . "The 'Pre-emi
nent One," in which -he showed the
influence of Jesus Christ on : alt man
kind.
The progress ' of the ages step by
step was due to his influence and the
great charity bestowed year by year
â¢was all the result of the divine â¢ pre
cept and teaching of the Savior. The
same influence was responsible for the
more charitable understanding be
tween Christian nations and even. for
the humane methods followed In pa
gan lands.
Dr. Bell showed how in Jauan tHe
higher ideals exist. There,, he said.
$1,000,000 is expended â¢ annually for
the Red Cross Society. He cited the
better protection of women and 'chil
dren than in former generations when
their toiling was a matter of custom.
The laws had grown kinder and the
relation between man . and man -had
vastly improved in. every -way.

61OPrincÂ«SuN.Y^OLD BRIG TANNER ARRIVES
AFTER A HARD TRIP.
Battered by the Elements, She
Finally Reaches Port.
The old brig Tanner, after the many
vicissitudes that have followed her for
the last fifty year*, once more hobbled
into port yesterday, storm beaten and
practically dismantled. She left Port
Angeles on December 2 and had barely
got into the Pacific when she ran into
b. tremendous hurricane. She was
knocked about and buffeted in all kinds
of gales until December 6. Here she
ran into a southwest gale which tossed
her about like a cockle shell. Two of
her staysails were blown away, as well
as her Jib.
la the midst of the storm ebe sprung
a leak. Great seas washed over her
from stem to stern and a big wave
e truck her windmill and carried it
away.
The captain sounded the pumps and
found that there were five feet of water
in the hold. The ship at this time was
practically at the mercy of the ele
ments, the storm was raging furiously
and the captain was almost at his wit's
end to know what to do. The crew wag
beginning to get belligerent. They went
aft to the captain's quarters and de
manded that he turn the vessel about
and fro back to the port from which
they started. This took place Just off
C&pe Flatttny. Captain Holstrom re
fused to act on his crew's demands and
c-rdered the vessel kept on her course
to this port. Heavy seas kept swash
ing over the decks, flooding her with
water. A tremendous gale from the
southeast was blowing all the time.
She finally succeeded in making port.
She brings lumber and shingles to J.
TV. Carey. The Tanner is the oldest
vessel now in commission on this coast.
She was built in 1S55 at Smithtown,
New. York. During her career she has
been in all kinds of mishaps. She was
humped up on the rocks of this coast
dozens of times, but has alvavg man
aged to get off with slight injury.
Has Terrible Fall.
AJwc OlMon had a terrible fail on the Brit-
Uh ehip Grenada yeaterday. He nu point:
down the ladder from the main deck to c*t a
bucket or water, when he missed his footing
Â«LUd clipped. He fell * distance of over thirty
reet, landing la the bottom of the hold -with
* terrible ibud. Why he vu not killed in
stantly Is a mvettry- Those on board Imme
diately rushed to the rescue. They lound him
a broken, bleeding mass. They picked him up
Â«.nd carried him on fleck and carefully laid
him out on a hatch, lie was unconscious and
the crew expected that he would die a.t ajiy
instant. They eent word on ebor* to Crow-
JÂ«y'e boat house to brinÂ« out a launch and
Crowley himself came out and brought the
man ashore. H<? was immediately taken to
the Harbor Emergency Hoepitat. Here it
was found that Oleson had suffered a com
pound fracture of the right thigh, a fracture
o? the right elbow and a dislocation of the
\f't elbow. ThÂ» entire right side of his face
wae almost srr.fushed to a pulp, while the left
side of his face was so bruised that it was
beyond recognition. Dr. Pinkham. who at
tended to the patient, said that notwithstand
ing the terrible Injuries he had received he
could not find any internal injuries. Later
on the man was removed to St. Mary's Hos
pital.
Crowds on Water Front.
A creat crowd thronged the water front
yesterday, and every iaum-h in the bay from
tfc? different boathouses was kept busy taking
crowd* out to the battleship Ohio and the
treat steamer Minnesota. About the gang
ways cf the Minnesota hovered a big fleet of
launch*-.* which came from every part of the
bay. The Gclden Gate brought on a number
of army officers from Angel Island and pri
vate tugs brought out a number of prominent
people in social and financial circles. The
niErr.moth steamer was thronged with visitors,
who cezkI in amazement at the proportions of
thÂ» greatest carrier that ever floated on the
Pacific. When the captain explained to a
number of his friends in the main drawlng
â¢rocm of the ship that the Minnesota, if she
were to b* stood up on her end, would be
twice as high as The Ca!l building, they could
harfily believe it. but It Is a fact <ust the
same. They aJso thought that when the cap
tain eald she could carry 25.000 tons of gen
eral frright that he was talking In generali
ties. She can do this, nevertheless. She can
carry 2S.000 tons of dead weight freight. She
will eall for Seattle to-day.

"BILLIONAIRE"
IS PLEASING
Possibilities of Fun Are
Xot Fully Developed, but
There Is Enough to Cheer
ORPHEUM BILL CLEVER
Variety Adds to Interest
and Audience Is Pleased.
California Draws Crowds
Harry B. Smith has done better things
and worse â not seriously worse â than
the book of "The Billionaire," which
made its first appearance . here last
night at the Columbia Theater. "The
Billionaire" is programmed as a "mu
sical farce," with Gus Kerker at- the
music. The title is ambitious. The
piece has not plot enough for farce, nor
music enough to be musical. The cen
tral idea, however, is quite funny,
though developed only slightly com
pared with its possibilities. There is a
billionaire as chief character, and his
attempts to spend some of the un
earned increment buying steamship
lines, theaters and such like trifles fur
nishes such story as there is. However,
the billionaire has only a comparatively
modest share of the interest. A man
aging American mamma, with a pen
chant- for French malapropisms, her
two rebellious daughters and- an unim
portant son and spouse take up much
time. There is also a waiter with a
plumful part, and a Hungarian Count
and a soubrette who figure largely in
the cast.
The feature of the piece is the setting
of the last act, the stage and audito
rium, with upper boxes and all the ap
pointments of a handsome theater. The
stage within the stage is cleverly used
for the specialties introduced, and the
novelty will doubtless attract many to
the performance. Audiences, the woman
with the large hatâ extinct here, hap
pilyâthe matinee matron, the matinee
man, the gentleman that amuses him
self falling over his neighbor's feet, and
so on, furnish some good fun here. The
stage burlesques are not startling.
Possibly in Jerome Sykes' hands the
billionaire. John Doe, was funnier than
Thomas Q. Seabrooke makes him. Mr.
Seabrooke's farce is of a particularly
mild brew. He seems rather to be say

to, but that he Intends to 'wait until to
morrow. You haven't Quite shown him
why he should, and he won't. He has
all the air, too, of the taken-for-grant

situation is your fault. Occasionally,
however, Mr. Seabrooke seems to for

approaching fun. His songs are very
Clearly sung, and the one, "The Little

was warmly welcomed, i
Of the other men Harry Macdonough
gives an amusing sketch of the waiter,
Baptlste. and Walter Percival is a
splendiferous gold-lace Hungarian as
Lieutenant Ladislas. He also owns a
voice and sings rather nicely.
Josle Intropidi as the managing mam
ma, in cerise locks and; canned com
plexion, is a very lively person. She
certainly does her best to; fill the Marie

modically amusing. Of the daughters
Miss Helen Dexter shows an unusually
pretty voiceâ a pure, clear, high so
prano. She has apparently, only just

dances delightfully. Shf also has a
pretty voice, and shoulc take serious
note of the fact. (

Rose Melville, in "Sis Hopkins," bÂ«
gan her second week at ; the California
last night to the usual large house. Just
before the curtain went up Louis Mor
rell. who plays the heavy, was taken
suddenly ill. and the part was played
by Herbert Farjeon, the Capable young
stage manager of the Alcazar stock.
Considering the fact that Mr. Farjeon
had no chance to rehearse and was
compelled to read the part, he acquitted
himself exceptionally well. "Sis Hop

rell will be well enough to resume his
part to-night. VSfM
The Orpheum bill this week has
something on it that is biJund to please
everybody. One can thoroughly enjoy
the various numbers ranging from the
soprano's sweet notes to the marvelous
performances of a bunch 7 of cockatoos
and parrots. Aida Hemmi, the soprano,
easily won a high place with her clear,
sweet notes. She rendered a few favor
ite selections and the audience was
loth to see her leave the stage. Lucy
and Viate are a pair of dainty young
women who can do almost any kind of
a trick on a slack wire. Albertina Mel
ich and her performing parrots and
cockatoos came in for their share of the
applause/ This is an original actâ one
that is both instructive and' amusing.
Alfred Farland. the great banjolst: the
Dillon Brothers, Ford Sisters and Herr
mann all had something welcome to of
fer and their efforts were, as usual, met
with merited applause.

encourage thrifty and industrious peo

best colored people of the South will
leave if , conditions continue as they
have for the last four or five years- It
is,my purpose to place them where they
can , best earn a livelihood, educate
their children, enjoy their franchise
and when they are so unfortunate as
to have to go before the courts they
will feel that justice will be meted out
to them."

first two or three days the course of the New York stock market
monopolized the attention of the country, but when it was'; seen" that
the vast financial interests of the metropolis had united to support
the harried market and had said to the frenzied Boston, speculator,
"Thus far shalt thou go and no farther!" the financial pool quieted
down again and all business directly connected with the Wall-street
market resumed its normal condition.
With the combined support of the moneyed interests under its
foundations the stock list ceased to decline and quotations began to
recover, and during the last half of the week the course was upward.
Money continued easy, averaging about 3 per cent for call loans,
and the volume of trading on the Exchange steadily decreased. The
conservative interests, which after all control conditions when they
run to extremes, are not in favor of a market which records daily
sales of from 1, 500,000 to. 2,000.000 shares, and would rather, see
the record under than over 1,00,000 per day, as being healthier and
more normal. From now on, for the present at least, we shall prob
ably have a steadier market. The frenzied Bostonian may bceak out
of his cage again and run amuck, but if he does he will undoubtedly,
be called down with sufficient sternness. There are too many
A leading Xew York financier says of the recent stock panic:
"This break is not likely to have any deterrent effect upon legitimate
business. If it checks the rampant spirit of speculation that was rapid
ly developing it will prove a blessing in disguise. Our farmers will
be none the less prosperous because stocks have broken several points;
our manufacturers will produce and sell none the less, and there will
be no fall in wages or any decrease in the number of hands employed
ifi consequence. There are just as many mouths to feed and bodies to
shelter, and the many activities of our industrial and business life will
go on about as usual. A few schemes may be held in abeyance, espe
cially those which depend upon deluded public buying; but in the
main the latest Wall-street shakeup will have little effect upon gen
eral business. The situation is vastly different from the panic .of
1903. when our whole financial and industrial fabric was weakened
by the mass of indigestible industrials thrown upon an overtaxed
market.*' WÂ£s& I
General trade continues exceptionally brisk for the closing
month of the year. The bank clearings still show a remarkable in
crease over last year, the gain for the week being 49.5 per cent, with
Cleveland the only city out of the first seventeen on the list to short*
a loss, and the aggregate clearings running away up to $3,175,000,000,
or 55 P er cent over the normal of S.Â»,goo,ooo,ooo. The gain at New
York was 74.2. per cent, at Pittsburg. the iron and steel center, 254
per cent: at Minneapolis, the Four center, 31 per cent, and so on.
These figures tell the story of the current expansion in general
business. The failures for the week were 276, against 329 last year.
The staples continue to exhibit excellent conditions. The iron
and steel industry is showing a steady improvement. The propor
tion of idle machinery is growing smaller and labor is fully employed
at maintained wages. Lumber and building operations are quieter,
but the restrictions come from cold weather rather than from any.
real decrease in building. But this same cold weather has stimu
lated the demand for winter goods all over the country and made
the hoiiriay trade .brisk. The only reports of>-inactivity are now
from the Pacific Coast, -which has not yet felt the wave of expansion
crossing the country from east to west. But_ there is_ no actual
dullness here. Our produce, as already mentioned, has about all
passed out of producers' hand?, and at fine prices, and during the
past week large orders for hay. barley, oats and flour have been
placed in San Francisco for Oriental account, supposedly for either
the Russians or Japanese. As for our crop conditions, they are
brilliant and could not well be otherwise, considering jthe ideal fall
we have had.
It will be difficult to find a year better than 1904, taking the
country on the whole. The first half, as already pointed out, was* quiet
and showed some recession, but the noteworthy activity of the last
half has more than offset the quietude of the spring and early sum
mer. With bumper crops of corn and cotton, enormous supplies
of money and an unusually large and widely distributed demand for
all sorts of merchandise, we shall probably pass put of 1904 and into
1905 with our commercial banners* waving merrily in the breeze of
prosperity.
SOME CENSUS RETURNS.
*"p*HE United States Census Bulletin which has just been issued
I deals, of-coursc, with facts rather than with speculative causes."
At the same time it is only by the patient study of accumulated
facts that any light can be thrown upon the mysterious laws which
govern population, and which become increasingly interesting and
increasingly important. The persisting excess of males over females
is. for example, very curious, an excess which is to be found in every
part of the world of which statistics are available, except Europe,
but which is greater in the United States than in any other country.
If such an excess were universal the problem would perhaps be less
perplexing, but that Europe should be the one known exception is
an added factor which provokes theory and investigation.
That the cities of the United States as well as those of Western
Europe should show a large preponderance of females is of course
<Jue to the" enlarged opportunities for the employment of women
which are now to be found in the centers of civilization, and the
same cause will accountior the preponderance of men in the country
districts. An obvious explanation is also to be found for the fact
that among the Chinese said to have been born in the United States
nearly three-fourths are males. The desire of the Celestial to avoid
the exclusion laws is, of course, an irresistible temptation to a false
return. That the death rate of males should be generally higher
than that of females may not seem to be remarkable in view. of
the fact that the great burdens and risks of life usually devolve
upon the man. But this by no means explains why this higher death
rate should apply to male children under three years of age, as is
the incontestable fact not only in the United States but also hi
Europe.
Even a census return is not without its delicate touch of humor.
A cold study of the figures seems to show that between the ages of
sixteen and twenty-five there are more women than men. This, how
ever, is due, according to the Census Bulletin, and for which we ac
cept no responsibility, to tbe greater number of women who claim
"erroneously" to belong to that age period.

Genuine Courtship Should FinD
Best Expression in Church Life
BY DOROTHY FENIMORE.
COVE is not to-day, a pagan god,
who comes to earth merely that
he may sport with human hearts,
although one might so infer from
the numerous metaphors taken from
mythology which are still In common
use. As suggested in an article pub
lished recently that affection between
man and maid which is the basis of
our family and social life *ls next ot
kin to the spiritual love which is rec
ognized as the greatest thing in the
world.
The attitude which a Rev. Dr. Wil
liams, ' who was quoted, took "on the
question was a wise one. To begin
with,, he gave an exact value to, the
terms he used. He drew a distinction
between flirtation and courtship, two
kinds of lovemaking which are. as dif
ferent from each other as gilt Is from
gold.
j Flirtation. is what a witty French
[ man defined it â "attention without In
tention," and it is nothing more. Like
; many another form of trifline', it has
j its place in bur scheme of tilings. '_ It
â¢serves as a. training ivnool of love,
i wherein girls learn graces that attract
men, and men learn accomplishments
j which overcome the feminine fancy.
Each gains a polish pi personality and
a nicety of judgment concerning the
other sex which it would be difficult
for either to acquire so well in any
other way., / -
Yet, using flirtation, in this sense,
which is certainly its correct meaning,
the church is not the proper place for
its cultivation. The drawing room or
the ballroom is decidedly more appro
priate. Flirtation is a, role which,
played upon the mimic stage, of life,
presupposes certain sta^e properties.
A suitable background is necessary â
palms, moonlight, stars shining softly
upon quiet waters; or the luxuries
which were bought by papa, an incon
spicuous personage in . the cast, but
nevertheless important. Good clothes,
the best that the players can afford,
is another essential; they form both
part of the background and of the ac
tor's makeup.
. But genuine courtship, or even that
sweet companionship between the sexes
wnlch implies itself merely, and the
interchange of gentle courtesies, ought
to find its best expression In church
life, ffo lo^e-making of this kind the
church offers a suitable trysting place.
In such surroundings a girl can make
new acquaintances more safely than in
any other place outside of her own
home, and can also become â intimate
in a pleasant and profitable way with
friends whom she already has.' And
here, as well, a young man, coming to
a great city as a stranger, can meet
nice girls and good women, who will
keep his ideals of womanhood pure and
high. .'-â â¢ ,, .
In order to fulfill ks mission a church
ought to be a second home to its mem
bers,' whether they are old or young.
Religion and life should be a combina
tion of noble motives and conscientious
practice for everyday use. And love is
MARKING WEDDING GFITS.
Among other of the good old-fash
ioned notions coming into vogue again
is one which concerns the marking of
wedding gifts of silver. Leading jewel
era of New York are now marking
solid-silver wedding presents with the
initials of the family name of^both
bride and groom, coupled by, the char
acter "&." In modern times it has
been the custom to mark such gifts
with the. initial of the bride's surname
only. Whether this was intended as
a special compliment to her, or
whether it was Intended to signify that
the gifts, both of her own and of the
bridegroom's family and friends, be
longed to her alone, is conjectural- In
some instances this custom has given
rise to discord, for in many cases the
bridegroom's friends felt that, as the
bride was to take his name, the -silver
gifts, being family property, obviously
should bear his initial, to indicate the
family name. However, the revival of
the former custom of utjlizingÂ»the sur
name initials both of bride and groom
will obviate future difficulties, and,'In
cidentally, make the silver markings
more aristic. The sudden popularity
of the revival of this "old: fashion" is
therefore easily explained.â Leslie's

possession of it -makes her willing to

her by her elders, which single life
would not involve.
"Love, home and children, these are
the heart words of life," says H. G.
Wells, turning from study of men of
Mars and the moon to that of a peo
ple and a planet nearer at hand. "The
toil of a man's daily life is rarely for
himself alone; . it goes to feed, to
clothe, -to- educate those cardinal con
sequences of his- being, his children.
Even more obviously is this the case
with his wife.' Even in rest and-recrea
tion life still manifests its quality. Tha
books the ordinary man reads turn
enormously on love-making, his theater
has scarcely -ever a play that has not
primarily a 'strong love interest, his
art rises to its most consummate tri
umph* In Venus and Madonna," and his
music la saturated in love suggestions."

THE RIGHTS
OF CHILDREN
"We must interpret the laws for
the protection of the young against
cruelty, oppression and Injustice," says
Henry Van Dyke. in Everybody's Maga
alne for December, "as evidence of the
world's growing sense of justice. Be
ginning; with the factory act of- 1833
and the mines and -collieries act of
1842 in -.England,; there has., been a
steadily increasing effort to diminish
and prevent the" degradation of the
race by the enslavement of childhood
to- labor. Even the parents' right of
control, says the modern world, must
be held in harmony : with the child's
right to life and growth, mental,
moral and physical. The law itself
must recognize the injustice of dealing
w-th young- delinquents as if they were
old and /hardened criminals. No more

courts' and probation officers, asylums
and reformatories, an intelligent and

life before it has fallen into hopeless
bondage to crime- â this is the spirit of
civilized legislation to-day. In 1903
no less than .ten of the American
State? enacted special statutes with
this end in view." â¢â.:.
PACE THAT KILLS.
In Xew . York and most of the large
centers of wealth there has been an
alarming increase of death from or
ganic heart trouble and Bright's dis
ease. . '. â . â  . .
This need not worry the comparative
ly poor. to any great extent, saya the
Bridgeport Post, for these are aristo
cratic 1 ailments. Bright's disease' comes
along with a rapid existence and late
hours and rich feeding and wineU.
In 1871 in New York City, the two
diseases mentioned killed 17.68 persons
out of every 10,000 of the population.
New York was a little slow thirty-three
years ago. It had only begun to learn
how to burn up money. The rich did
the best they knew how then, and were
willing to learn more.
The pace quickened, and so did the
death rate. You can't fool the Old Man
with . the Scythe. You cannot sneak
late hours and highballs and thousand
dollar dinners in on him. and so in 1SS3
the rfeaths had jumped to 2888 from
heart disease and Bright's disease, or
21.91 persons in every 10,000. In 1903 the
total deaths from the causes named
were -5947, and the number of persons
per 10,000, 27.20. ;;' : :/V
The remedy is sane living. That
doesn't mean that one can begin living
sanely after he has sowed wild oats for
a 1 quarter of a century. The crops put
in must be harvested. It means sane
living from childhood up. A look at the
vital statistics quoted ought to make
the average poor man who has robust
health fairly well satisfied with his
condition.

The Value of Cheerfulness
-^HEERFULNESS is to a certain
CO extent a matter of temperament.
Some are constitutionally sanguine
and always fix their eyes on the
bright side. .They cao.see cause for
'lappiness even in times of trial and
misfortune. "How unfortunate you
are!" said a friend to a poor man who
had lost a limb by a railway accident.
"It might have been much worse," re
plied the maimed mr.n cheerfully.
'Sow 'worse?'. 1 "I might have lost both
legs." Philosophy does not often go so
far as this. Undoubtedly the possession
of it adds much to the happiness of
any on% biessed with it. His bright
views of life are> contagious and con
tribute to .make those around him
cheerful. A household is blessed which
contains within it one of these apostles
of good cheer. On the other hand, a
melancholy person depresses all v.ithin
thejsphere of his influence. The psalmist
speaks of advanced age, with its at
tendant Infirmities, as bringing days in
which man can take little pleasure, but
to the young or those in vigorous mid
dle age there is no excuse for regarding
the earth as "a vale of tears." Even ad
vanced old age need not, be gloomy*
Few human lives flow altogether
smoothly. Uninterrupted happiness and
prosperity are rare. It is the' touch of
which this enrichment was bestowed.

adversity, the approach of trial, that

To endure reverses with manly cheer
fulness marks a nature inwardly noble.
It may be prudent to scent misfortune
from afar and groan over the prospect,

happiness. The seamstress, who stitches

YOUNG WOMAN'S
PITIFUL STORY
Mrs. Minnie Davis Seeks lle
fugre in the City Prison
for Herself and Baby Boy
ASKS FATHER FOR HELP
Says Her. Husband Made Her
Earn Living for Family
as Dance Hall Waitress
Mrs. Minnie Davis, a. comely looking
young woman, and., her baby boy
about 17 months old are lodgers at the
City Prison. Mrs. Davis' father is
John R. Stine of 3108 Vinton street,
Omaha, Neb., head of . the . Mystic
Shrlners of that city, and she has wired
to him for money to take her back to
her home, as she Is destitute. .
Yesterday Mrs. Davis called upon
Captain Duke at the Central Police
Station- She exolained that she had
been informed that he was a Mystic
Shriner and she asked him to help her.
She told a pitiful story and at once en
listed the sympathies of the captain.
She said she was married to Clyde
Davis in Omaha about three years ago.
Davis was then in the service of the
Federal Government. They lived hap
pily for a year or so, and then her hus
band began to neglect her. He lost
his position and three months
ago they came to this city. Their
funds were soon exhausted, and as her
husband did not obtain employment
she procured a position in the Empo
rium. Her income was not sufficient
to keep them and she said iier husband
made her get employment in the Cape
Nome Dance Hall at 525 Pacific street
as a waitress, . with the consequent
degradation that attaches to Buch a
position. Her husband remained at
home in their room at 644 Sacramento
street most of the time and looked aft
er the baby.
Captain Duke and Policeman Engel
went to the room at 644 Sacramento
street, where they found Davis. The
captain denounced him for his conduct
and he whiningly said: "Do I look like
a man" that would do such a thing?"
After Mrs. Davis had gathered togeth
er her few personal effects she and her
baby were sent to the City Prison and
Duke sent the dispatch to her father In
her name. Davis, she said, had torn
up their marriage certificate, but she
picked up the pieces and handed them
to Attorney Joseph Cognet, who lives
in the same house.
man, Daniel O'Connell, Miss O'Connell,
Mr. and Mrs. Louis Kelly and Mr. and
Mrs. William H. Powers.
The tea given yesterday afternoon
from 4 to 6 o'clock by Mrs. E. Dinkelspiel
at the Hotel St. Francis was one of the
largest given this winter. The large red
parlors on the mezzanine floor were
utilized, and pretty decorations of cut
flowers and ferns made the rooms most
attractive. Three hundred Invitations
were Issued, and a delicious crush was
seen in the rooms at the busy hour,
most of the men calling after 5 o'clock.

the feast, in truth.
Tickets for the breakfast may be ob

to the large club membership- . . . .

If there's a more earnest worker in
clubdom at ' the present holiday hour
than Mrs. Sidney Smith Palmer of the
California Club I haven't met her. As
a, member of the Social Science section,
she has planned an active canvass for
the erection in California. of a hospital
for tubercular patients. The section
bears the enthusiastic support" of the
club, and goes out to every organiza-'
tion of influence in the State. The fol
lowing are the facts set forth In the
circular letter:
One person out of every nine In the United
States â¢ dt*e of tuberculosis. Twenty-flve years
ago it I was supoosed to be due to hereditary
taint and preventive measures ,were wanting.
To-day it Ms known that tuberculosis is com
municable, - preventable and, in Its earlier
stages, . curable. Thousands afflicted with- tu
berculosis are Ignorant of these facts and
thousands are indifferent to its dangers. They
are, nevertheless, a menace, not only to the
health of their own households, but to that of
thP community at larte.
It Is, therefore, the duty of the people Of
this State to do all in their power to prevent
and to eradicate this disease. The most suc
cessful results are â  obtained In . sanitorta es
tablished for the specific purpose of treating
tuberculosis only, t In Germany this method
has reduced the percentage of deaths in the
flirt and second stages of tuberculosis to prac
tically nothing.
Fresh air, proper exercise, nourishing food
and hygienic treatment are important elements
in the cure. , A sanatorium should be specially
designed to supply these features. Many East
ern States are building sanatoria for thÂ« treat
ment and cure of tuberculosis, based upon the
experience of private institutions of that char
acter. The economic gain to the community
by the prevention /and cure of this dread dis
ease Is -enormous.
Whereas, it is the sense of the California
Club that State and municipal laws should be
enacted whereby the spread of tuberculosis. In
all its forms, may be prevented and whereby
there shall be inaugurated a systematic edu
cation of the public In the care, treatment and
piwention of the disease, and whereby State
sanatoria ?haU be established for the scientific
treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis; end,
whÂ»rens, the California Club is preparing; un
der the best legal and . medical advice, & bill
carrying a reasonable appropriation for thÂ«
above named purposes, to be introduced In the
coming legislature of this State; therefore,
be it ' â  y -
Resolved, in view of these facts, That the
California Club does hereby call : upon the
people of this State to do all in their powÂ«r to
secure .the passage of this bill and to make
personal appeals to the legislators for prompt
and favorable action In Its behalf.
'â¢ Inclosed with this appeal is a blank,
to be filled out by each lady addressed
and returned to the club, stating its at
titude in the matter. .
Now, tuberculosis isn't a pleasant
topic to dwell upon, but a cheery
thing" of reflection at this yuletide pe
riod, but it is an issue that 'we, as an
intelligent people,^ are called upon to
meet. Then let's do it. '
SOCIALISM AND ITS
. , . -RELATION TO "SCABS"
Interesting Lecture by Jack London
to a Large Audience at the ,
Alhambra.
Last night at. the Alhambra "Jack"
London explained the merits of his
political belief and "the demerits of a
system that accumulates and does not
distribute. From his standpoint
socialism does not mean what the unÂ»
tutored in the teachings of that party
think it does, but it is a development
of political and domestic ideas that
will eventually lead to the betterment
of- universal conditions.- commercial
and otherwise.
The announcement that the clever
but erratic novelist would talk on
"scabs'' attracted a large audience to
the theater. None seemed disap
pointed, for the speaker's . discourse
was instructive, although , it . may not
have been strictly in accordance with
the views of all of his hearers. He
spoke of the "scab" as the result ot
certain environments that are not
necessarily the outcome of a strike or
a movement against the closed shop.
The "scab" is evolved, according to
London's ideas, from an overindul
gence in too many easy coming things
in life and <he is bred as naturally as
a mosquito in a swamp. He is a social
evil springing from the accumulation
of. too much wealth r and is not con%
fined to any particular class of man.
Capital Is merely the surplus' that
labor has not received and labor is
'chiefly* instrumental in creating
capital. . -â â â¢ â "':'â . ' â â¢_â â â¢
..To avoid' the inevitable results of
too much . capitalization, , and conse*
qtiently the inadvertent fostering of
the "scab," certain restrictions are
necessary, and : these . the Socialist
party .is best adapted to provide.
Socialism is only in its infancy, yet it
is strorfg. and waxes stronger , as it ls>
better, understood. A â  thorough un
derstanding between the factions that
combine to make a world, is the prin
ciple of true socialism.
- The speaker was weir received and
frequently interrupted by applause.

WORK PLANNED
State Commissioner of Pub
lic Works Ryan Tells of
Result of Recent Surveys
$16,QQO,gop IS REQUIRED
Eastern Engineers Outline
I Scheme to Prevent Floods
in the Sacramento .y alley
Special Dispatch .to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 18.â Frank D.
Ryan," State Commissioner of. Public
Works, returned to-day from Sioux
City, Iowa, where* 1 he"" attended . the
meetings Qf the Eastern engineers, Ma
jor Dabney, Major" Richardson and Ma
jor Chittenden, who have; studied the
reclamation and drainage /problems in
California and have formulated. an ex
tensive - report for the improvement â¢ of
the present conditions, which will be
submitted to the Legislature. ; The .re
port -was not completed when Commis
sioner Ryan left Sioux City, although
the? plan it_ would propose was outlined.
Concerning the .report Ryan said:
It embraces a ''comprehensive plan for the
improvement of the Sacramento River and the
reclamation of the swamplands. ; The main fea
ture-will be to provide' a sufficient cross sec
tion area to, carry all the. water between prop
erly constructed levees, and the work to be un
dertaken will .bo <Wth this end: in view. Es
cape, ways and wiers will only be permitted
temporarily until sufficient embankments* are
constructed i or .channel,-, area , provided. . This
treatment has been successful with the Missis
sippi TUver and.no doubt .will - be successful
with the Sacramento."
The j report will probably not- suggest / any
treatment for the San Joaquln River, as it" is
believed that river can take care of Itself if the
Sacramento | is properly Improved.
I believe the engineers will recommend that
the construction and control of these levees
be placed with some central authority In or
der to insure the uniformity of the whole sys
tem., It will require future legislation to carry
the recommendations of the report Into effect.
Attorneys | selected; by the . River Improvement
and Drainage Association are now considering
bills. In line the engineer" â  recommenda
tions. ; ..-'!" ,.- . ' ,
We will appeal to the Federal Government
for aid in carrying out this plan. I under
stand one-third of the cost of the work on
the Mississippi has been contributed by ; the
Government, and- we ought to get as much.
The rest should come from the land', owners
and the State. â 
It is estimated' the work outlined will
cost 516,000,000.
CHRISTMAS GIFT
FOND FOR "NAN"
Attendants in the Tombs
to Biiy; Present for the
Former "Florodora" Girl
Special Disoatch to .The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 18.â So confident
is "Nan" Patterson of acquittal that
her belief has spread . to the prison at
tendants, who;, are subscribing to a
fund Vith which to buy a present to
give to her when she Is discharged.
They also will give her a Christmas'
present. -â 'â 
"Nan" spent a cheerful and hopeful
day In the Tombs. She was in a more
normal mental state than on Satur
day, when she was nervous and some
what low spirited. She several times
remarked to the attendants that she
was glad it. was her "last" Sunday in
prison. To-day she" joked and* laughed
with several of the women
to whom she had taken a fancy. She
remarked to the matron that she was
anxious to v go oni the stand and was
positive she would be acquitted.
The prisoner's father called to see
her in the morning, but she acted on
the advice given to her on Saturday
by her. counsel and sent word to him
that she could not see him or anybody
else. Patterson then j sent a note to
her and received a long written mes
sage in reply. Several futile attempts
were made by women, evidently friends
of Miss Patterson, but who refused to
give their names, to see her to-day. ,
"The trial will be resumed to-morrow
morning .when it will be announced by
her counsel whether she is to go v on
the stand. â¢.

BRITT USES EXTREME CAUTION
ON EVE OF HIS COMING BATTLE
Welson Throws Discretion to tne Winds in a Bout
Boxes Fiercely With
â  Santry for Two
Rounds.
â¢There was no rough -work for Jimmy
3rttt yesterday at his Ocean Beach
gymnasium. It is too close to the crisis
'and the pride of California does not
>vant to hurt his hands except* on the
physiogomy or the anatomy of tfce
"iron-visaged. steel-ribbed Nelson. A
little meander by the sad sea waves
and a few rapid rounds with little
Johnny Roach, the 15-year-old 100
â¢r*ucd phenom, made up- the day's
v.ork.
There Â«u a clamoring multitude
.about the Seal Rock House, but most
'<<t them 'had to remain outside. The
'gymnasium, which holds orÂ£y forty,
had about 200 in it all afternoon. Ad
mirers sardir.ed themselves into every
.nook and corner.
. Although it is the eve of the battle
James Edward shows no furrows of
Â«.ar? on his alabaster brovr. In the
bout wiih little Roach he passed out
.the jests in rapid succession. Jimmy
feels he is net due for a beating to
morrow night and retains the Britt
confidence in himself.
Spider Greenway Kelly, head strate
gist for Britt. was also full of confi
dence. The Spider feels his charge is
in the best condition of his career. He
paced around with the glad m'itt"ex
tended and echoed the feeling of con
fidence that hangs over Camp Britt.
Frank Rafael looks as though he had
t>een w orking. He seems - glad the
roughing is over. Britt will take only
light exercise to-day and- to-morrow in
order to keep within the weight, which
he expects to make easily. . .
â¢The largest crowd of sporting men
that has visited -Larkspur for many
â¢moons crowded ' Smiling ' Metzner's
tavern yesterday to watch Battling
kelson work for his coming battle
with Britt.
From early morning untH late in'the
afternoon the crowd kept gathering
and by the time Battling was ready
to work, rafter room was at a pre
mium. The Eagle Drum Corps was on
hand, and the quartet rendered several
selections. The fair sex was well rep
resented and all enjoyed the show.
Although the v. eat her was -wintry on
the outside the gym was stifling. Bat
went through his usual stunts, and
donned the mitt? with Rawhide Kelly
for a round. Kelly made quite a hit
with the ladies, although he merely hit
tfce carpet. Eddie Santry came next
and he find the Battling one went at
it hammer and tongs for two rounds.
Eddie could have gone a few more, but
was tvillingr to quit. Bat then did his
jumping; rope specialty and was
heartily applauded by the spectators.
After a selection by the drum corps
quartet Bat retired to his dressing
room amid the cheers of his admirers.
In the morning Bat took a short sprint
as en eye-opener. He is well down to
weight and seems in the pink of con
dition. .i,r-
Nelson's sÂ«Â»<r>nds nn thejnight of the
â Tight will be Ted Murphy. Eddie San
try. Rawhide Kelly and Smiling Metz
ner.
Brisk betting is expected to-day on
the fight. The odds were 10 to 8 with
Britt favorite when wagering closed on
Saturday. The price is expected to go
10 to 7 and possibly lower. Consider
able betting is expected on the num
ber of rounds the fight will last. ,
While it is* known no boxer ever en
tered the ring who was proof against
a properly directed knockout blow,
each of these men thinks the other
oannot put him out. On this account
they may t&k* chances which they
would avoid otherwise.
Th.^ boxers are in condition for a
long strucprle and it remains to be
seen which will give wav first.

RACKETS SWING
ON THE COURTS
Many Matches Are Played
on the Club Courts and
â¢ in Golden Gate Park
On the California tennis courts yes
terday several continuous tournament
matches were played, while at the pub-,
lie courts in Golden: Gate Park the
fourth-class tournament was completed
down to the finals. The latter event
was started several weeks age, but has
been postponed several times . on ac
count of the wet weather. Only eight
players were left to compete yesterday,
but owing to delay occasioned by wait
ing for a player who did not appear
the game was not finished. N. P. Mar
tin and W. A. Peck reached the finals,
which will be played next Sunday.
In the continuous tournament three
first-class matches were played, with
the result that George Janes remains
in third place and Carl Gardner goes up
one number. In the Janes-Will Collier
match the latter was the challenger
and lost three sets out of four. By mu
tual agreement the match was made
three sets out of five instead of two out
of three. All four sets were close, but
Janes clearly outplayed his opponent.
He won the first two sets and Collier
took the third. Janes led at 5-1 in the
fourth and won out when Collier got as
far us 4-5.
Carl Gardner went up only one peg,
but he beat two good. men. In the first
match he beat S. H. Adams two sets
out of three. Gardner was No. 12 and
Adams No. 13. Gardner next took on
Frank Mitchell, who was No. 11, and
won three seta out of four. Gardner
won the first, second and fourth sets
easily. The third Mitchell took by a
small margin.

AGGIE W RUNS
IN FINE FORM
Til lent Makes Her Short End
Throughout the Day and
She Captures the Stake
T. Burke's Aggie W proved a stum
bling block for the talent yesterday at
Union Coursing Park. They laid odds
against her in all her trials and she
romped home with the reserve stake
in clever style. She beat In succes
sion Miss Lucille at 2 to 1, Sunny
brook at 3 to 1, Medea at 3 to 1, Bob
R at 5 to 2, Renegade Apache at 3
to 1 and Racing Auto at 5 to 4.
In the deciding course Racing Auto
dropped dead after running more than
two minutes. Aggie W showed to be
the faster, as she led and won the
course easily. She coursed after the
hare four minutes and twenty-four
seconds before the relief dog killed the
jack.
Quita won the flag from Carlow
Boy in the final of the class stake.
Carlow Boy was on the short end at
5 to 2 and led the favorite six lengths
to the hare, but tired badly. The
favorite then came on and won easily.
The coursing throughout the day
was first class and the hares tested
the dogs to the limit. The betting
was unusually even on account of the
large number of speculators who were
willing to back. their choices. Follow

BRILLIANT PLAY
ON POLO FIELD
The Reds, Captained by Walter Hobart,
Defeat Whites by One Goal.
The clever poloiets of the Burllngame
Country Club played a brilliant game
on the club field yesterday, the* Reds,
captained by Walter S. Hobart, win
ning by a score of 4 to 3. The Reds
were picked to win by the expert* on
the ground, but to the surprise of the
spectators, the Whites played on the
aggressive from the start, dashing Tom
Driscoll scoring the first two goals
cleverly. The Whites maintained their
lead until the sixth period "when the
Reds scored first a goal that made them
a tie with their opponents, and then
Cyril Tobin scored the winning point.
The teams lined up:
Reds â Charles Dunphy, C. A. Tobin,
W. S. Hobart and John Lawson.
Whitesâ R. M. Tobin, T. A. Driscoll,
J. O. .Tpbin and Lawrence McCreery.
The referee was Joseph S. Tobin.
The honors in the scoring of goals
were about equally distributed, Mr.
Driscoll making two, Cyril Tobin two,
Walter Hobart two and R. M. Tobin
one. The gallery which witnessed the
"game was one of the largest of the sea
son, many of the fashionable set watch
ing the contest from the sidelines in
their automobiles and smart equipages.
When the ball was thrown in at the
, opening of the first period the Whites
assumed the aggressive at once and
soon had the ball around their adver
sary's goal. When it seemed they must
score the ball was driven outside. The
field was uneven and the ball did not
bound truly. Sometimes it settled in
the uneven places, from which it was
hard to extricate it. Walter Hobart
missed a shot at. the goal just before
the period ended. One of the features

Vto-day, Avhich consists of over 1500 words. In it I tell you to
play certain horses to win, only if certain jockeys ride, and I
also point out instances where my second choice is a better

It is not the number of first choices that win, that counts t
in a complete racing message, but THE NUMBER OF
WINNING BETS ADVISED. For instance, on Friday I
gave Glendenning to win and W. R. Condon for place, and I
B advised A PLUNGE FOR THE LIMIT on Condon for
place. Condon won at 10 to 1 straight and 4 to 1 place. II

of the play was the tantalizing manner
in which Charley Dunphy rode Law
rence McCreery off the ball, thus reduc
ing his effectiveness. The period ended
without either side scoring.
In the second -period Tom DrisctHl
was in his best form, scoring two goals
and barely missing a third.
Cyril Tobin sent the ball between ths
posts for the Reds early in the third
period, after it had been placed by
Charley Dunphy. This period was bit
terly contested from first to last, the
players having out' their best ponies..
Neither side was able to score in the
fourth period. Lawrence McCreery
was mounted on a gray ghost of a
pony which seemed to outfoot the
others at every stage of the play. C
In the fifth period the Whites again
assumed the lead. R. M. Tobin scoring
after Tom Driscol! had placed the ball.
A claim was made that Mr. Tobin was
off side, but this was not allowed.
Walter Hcbart tied the score in tha
sixth period, nursing the ball nearly
the length of the field with easy but
sure strokes. Joe Tobin had the hard
luck to hit one of the goal posts with
! the ball, which bounced outside, thus
j depriving the Whites of another goal.
Cyril Tobin scored the winning goal for
the Reds near the end of the period.
He had the ball in his possession some
time and was applauded by the spec
tators when he finally shot it between
the posts. With the game won, tha
Reds played for time, acting entirely on
the defensive and keeping the ball
away from the center of the field as
much as possible. Joe Tobin Jr., who
played some of F. J. Mackey's ponies,
was the most brilliant performer on the
neld.

"With the solemn rites of the Roman

church was blockaded with members of
the congregation and their friends, who \
stood in the chilling breeze and watch

iJrc-priate psalms and sprinkling holy
water, made the round c/f the. building.
The procession included some of the
best known priests in the city/ as it
moved from point to point around the
splendid building which stands a mon

priest of the parish, Father CVttle.
The ceremonies outside being con
cluded, the doors were thrown open and
a solemn pontifical high mass was sung.'
Special music was furnished by the,
regular choir of St. Brlgid's. augmented
