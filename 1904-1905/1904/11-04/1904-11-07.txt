Senator Chaurcev M. Depew 6aid: "The tilt between Judge Parker
and President Roosevelt will not change ten votes in the country. It came
too late in the campaign, viewed purely as a political bomb. The people's
minds were already made up. Even if there were those who may have
had any doubts about President Roosevelt's position with the trusts, the
President's vigorous and emphatic denial has fixed that matter straight.
The little fight at the finish of the campaign was unique. I have been in
twelve Presidential campaigns and I have never known one candidate to
accuse another, holding office, of acts which would, if the accusation were
true, make him personally unfit for high office. On the other hand, I have
never known a man holding the office of President to come right out in
meeting and call another candidate a liar. But that's Roosevelt's way and
the people like It. I read Roosevelt's retort yesterday In several speeches
up the State and It was cheered, loudly everywhere."
John D*Â»Witt Warner said: "The only thing peculiar about Judge Par
kers position is that it was so tardily taken. The only peculiarity of
President Roosevelt's position was that he so promptly appreciated and.
from his view, corralled the trusts in his own behalf. The only effect of
what they have been saying is to convince voters that Parker detests such
methods and. if elected, will do what he can to stop trust rule, but that
Roosevelt, though he has tjie good taste to be angry when exposed in this
business, intends, while denying it, t o get the benefit of it."
Perry Belmont says: "The President has not denied that contributions
from corporations have been made to the Republican campaign fund. As
pointed out by Judge Parker, euch contributions are, in fact, contributions
oÂ£ stockholders, made without their knowledge or consent and in violation
.. iaw. Judge Parker declares that, | n the event of hiB election, he will
employ every power that legally and constitutionally inheres to the great
office of President to check this evil. We have no such promise from
Roosevelt." .
Oscar S. Straus said: "Judge Parker's insinuating charge that Presi
dent Roosevelt had conspired with Cortelyou In order to squeeze money
out of the trusts was monstrous. If anything is firmly established in the
rainds of th<Â» American people it is that Roosevelt's character is invul
nerable. The charee is so monstrous that fair-minded men will resent it
who othewiF* 5 would have voted for Parker. The claws of the management
of the Hill campaign have come out from under the Judicial ermine and
people are disgusted with that kind of tactics. The President's answer
was mar.lv. unequivocal and directly met the charge."
Judge Parker is reproached and rebuked by leading Republicans for
Intimating that Roosevelt has been capable of acts which would render
him personally unfit to hold the high office of President of the United
States. President Roosevelt is ridiculed by leading Democrats for making
a reply to Judge Parker, conspicuous for its display of anger and failure
to deny that the trusts have contributed to the Republican campaign
fund.
NEW TORK. Nov. 6.â Interviews with men prominent in politics show
that the tilt between President Roosevelt and Judge Parker in the closing
hours of the campaign has struck fire in both great parties and brought
them to the battle front with heartier zest than was dreamed of in the
earlier davs of the campaign.

Notes left by the physician told of his
deliberate preparations for death. He
wrote that in order to remove the pos
sibility of failure he Intended to adopt
three certain methods of ending his life.
When found he was not quite dead, but
died an hour later at the hospital to
which he was hurriedly removed.
Dr. Gagen was 46 years of age and is
paid to have been a man of considerable
wealth. The husband of the woman at
whose house the couple were rooming
committed suicide two years ago in the
same room In an almost identical man
ner, except that he did not use chloro
form.
Dr. and Mrs- Gagen came to Los An
geles a month ago from Oregon for
the former's health and secured rooms
at 723 South Hope street. The doctor
was afflicted with an incurable disease
of the heart and although he knew that
his days were numbered he 'gave no
indication of ending his life.
A week ago yesterday, accompanied
by their landlady, the doctor and his
wife went to a Turkish bath establish
ment intending to remain all night. At
the entrance to the ladles' department
he bade his wife good-night, saying he
would caU for her In the morning. The
next morning when the women sent
wora by an attendant that they were
waiting for the doctor they were in
formed that he had left the place im
mediately after they had entered the
female department.
Hurrying home they found the house
filled with illuminating gas. It was al
most impossible for them to remain in
the hallway, but divining what had
happened Mrs. Gagen. despite the gas.
rushed to her husbands room. She
found him upon the floor near the bed.
Across his mouth was a towel, on
which a pint of chloroform had been
poured. A hypodermic syringe was near
his hand, and every burner of a gas
stove in the room was turned on.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 6.â Dr. Edward
Thomas Gagen. for years a prominent
physician of Baker City, Ore., commit
ted suicide by the most elaborately
planned process ever recorded Tin thin
city a week ago. He used gas, chloro
form and morphine, together . to. make
sure of death. ' Prof essional . courtesy
due to one physician from another and
the tearful pleadings of the heart
broken w-idow are the reasons now
given by the Coroner for keeping the
matter secret. The facts came to light

OWINGSVILLE, Ky., Nov. 6.â After
a man hunt extending over the greater
part of the Menifee County mountains,
two officers whose names. have not yet
.been learned entrapped Lipton Day,
one of the mo6t desperate outlaws in
the Kentucky mountiijns^andiA battle
with"" rifles' took placed Day . killed, -the
two officers, but lost" his own life in the
fight.
. The battle occurred on Indian Creek,
in Menifee County. The officers had
been chasing Day, and from the ap
pearance of the men's bodies when
found the three evidently" had fallen at
almost the same moment. Their weap
ons were lying near them. .
Day had long terrorized that section
of the mountains. A reward of $800 was
offered for his capture for the killing
of Howard Wilson, United States Mar
shal, three years ago.
The battle in which Wilson was killed
took place in ; August, 1901.. Day was
wanted for making moonshine whisky,
and Wilson, with a posse of officers,
went to Menifee County after him. Day
was with several companions when
found and was ordered to surrender.
He and his companions opened fire on
the officers. Howard Wilson and one of
Day's companions were killed, and .Wil
liam Stamper, a member of Wilson's
posse,' shot Day five times, badly
wounding him.
Day was placed in jail at French
burg, from which he was later rescued
by his followers. Day was a fugitive
and lived* in a cabin between two high
mountains.' He maintained a line of
guards for several miles from his moun
tain retreat, who kept strangers from
approaching i him. â¢ He wore a coat of
mall under his clothing to prevent as
sassination. Although only 24 years
old, he had killed eight men.

EVIDENCE OF CONSPIRACY.
In these facts the Police Department
sees evidence of a conspiracy that De
tective Coleman thinks originated in
Chicago, where, according to his
theory, the; brothers, seeing that
they . could not get possession of
the money Mrs. Bowers held In trust,
decided to lure the woman to Califor
nia and here compel her to give it
them either by peaceful or foul means.
Coleman holds that it is another Soe
der case, but. this theory is ' not very
well borne out by statements made by-
Mrs. Bowers. Nor is there other than
the. testimony of the landlord and land
lady at 216 Kearny street, where the
Bowerses roomed during the first two
days spent in this city, to substantiate
the story that Harley and Robert Bow
ers fled with all of the wife's property.
However, the nolice are inclined to
place confidence In their deductions
and have discovered evidence that in a
measure bears them out.
"When my husband, his brother
and myself arrived in San Francisco."
said Mrs. Bowers yesterday, "we rented
a room at 215 Kearny street- I did
not like the locality and we decided to
move. ' \i'."
Eleven years ago Harley Bowers of
Chicago married Miss Butts of Carbon
dale, 111., and last Saturday' afternoon,
two days after the arrival of the couple
in San Francisco from the . Middle
West, the man suddenly disappeared,
taking with. htm all of the family coin
and personal, property, leaving his
wife penniless and sick in a community
,of_ strangers. This is the -brief intro
duction to a story- that contains much
"of pathos and mystery. The deserted
woman furnishes the 'pathos, theÂ»police
detectives supply the mystery.
Wednesday morning Harley Bowers
and his wife reached this city on the
Central Overland train. Accompanying
the pair was Robert Bowers, a brother
of the woman's husband. The object ot
the trip of the brothers was ostensibly
to acquire some sort of business on the
coast, where they had decided to taKe
up their residence. Before leaving Chi
cago Mrs. Bowers, who at the time of
her marriage was considered a wealthy
woman, drew from the business of her
brother, William A. Butts, of Carbon
dale $3600, with which she intended to
assist her husband in the purchase of
such business as he might see fit to en
ter. Saturday morning Bowers had his
wife give him all the money that was
leftâ 53000â saying that he was going
to place it in a savings bank.
But Bowers did not stop at the ap
prppriating of the $3000. He took all or
Mrs. Bowers' dresses, her jewelry, her
little trinkets, such as women treasure
â her manicure sets, silverware 1 â in
short, everything that had a commer
cial value, leaving on the floor of their
rooming place a few soiled pieces or
linen after he had separated his own
apparel from the family, clothes bag.
Sick and despondent, the poor woman
is cared for by Mrs. Gunn, the landlady
of a flat at 176 Fell street, where the
Bowerses had come to live. Even the
small change that was in the sick wo
man's purse was taken.

The-re is a distinct feeling of disappointment among Washington
Democrats at the final outcome of the passage at arms between Mr. Roose
velt and Judge Parker. They do not attempt to conceal â¢ their feeline that
Judge Parker came out of it very much damaged, because he had no proofs
to produce and in his speech simply reiterated his first charges.
The President stood readv last night to make a reply to Judcrr Parker,
had he attempted to produce proofs in his Brooklyn speech. He waited
until midnight and received press dispatches giving the substance of what
Judge Parker said. When it was announced by Secretary Loeb that the
President would not make further reply, it was accepted that the personal
controversy between Republican and Democratic candidates' for the presi
dency was at an end and that nothing further would be forthcoming from
the White House. - Â¦â¢â¢Â¦-- i-**ixÂ»- -.- â ::....- â¢ ..-Â¦â¢
CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON, WASHINGTON, Nov. 6.âPresi
dent Roosevelt will make no rejoinder to Judge Parker's Brooklyn speech
of last night. Neither Mr. Roosevelt nor his friends think that any reply
if required. The President's position is that his own statement of Friday
night could be answered only by an attempt to offer proof substantiating
the Democratic charges of the last two weeks, and, since Judge Parker did
not do this, no further White House statement is expected.
Neither will the President make any reply to the statement issued bv
the Democratic National Committee to-night, to the effect that the Republi
cans have a J5.000.o00 trust fund. Whatever is said in answer to this is
likely to come from national headauarters in New York.
The President was not giving much attention to the Democratic
charges to-night, but ppent the entire evening with his family and received
no news. Secretary Loeb was not at his office to-night, and it was an
nounced at his house that he had retired at 9 o'clock.

We stated that from the information we were
able to obtain, and we had taken special
pains to feel assured of Its correctness, the
parties named should be cited to appear before
.the Election Commission that they might as
certain if they were properly enrolled. We did
not demand tbe dlsfranchisement of any per
son who was entitled to vote, nor did we sug
gest that our statements should be considered
final or conclusive of illegal registration.
Doubtless such names are found by your of
fice before every election and stricken from the
rolls without great public comment.
Our information concerning the lists which
we have sent you seemed to us to Justify the
request which' we made, and the facts have
proved the wisdom of our suggestion. From,
the lists of about 382 . names submitted (not
lncludlns Chinese nor the last list of 2u3
names sent. you on the 5th inst.) you have re
ported but thirty-nine as properly entitled to
be registered. Prom the list which we sub
mitted as registered . from the City and County
Hospital, numbering fifty-nine, you have re
ported but twenty-six as properly on the reg
ister. Surely you cannot Justly Impugn our
motive or good faith when we now call your
attention to the remaining number of S43 who
have apparently, been found not entitled Â¦ to a
place upon the 'great register.
Our misinformation regarding . the five fire
men registered - from the engine-house at 673
Howard street came from ' the fact that tha
open doors of the engine-house obscured the
number, and the adjoining house, which was
being torn down, gave our representative tha
impression that the parties registering from
676 Howard street, which would come at
about this 'spot, had occupied the house which
was being torn down and had moved there
from'and thus lost their right of registration
from that number. We much regret this er
ror. We would" call your attention, and
theirs, to the fact that we have never, in any
communication to you or to the press, desig
nated as "ballot box' stuff ers". any parties who
might be Illegally registered, for It doubtless
occurs from error, as well as from . intent, but
if the names remain upon the register after
the parties have left their residences. It opens
up an opportunity for the' would-be stufter to
use: the names, which act we feel it our duty
to prevent. If the case Â¦ comes â¢ within our
knowledge: and It Is not only the duty of the
Election Commissioners to prevent every pos
sible-case of. illegal voting or registration, but
to Investigate every suspicious case submitted
without questioning" the motives of the-indi

CHICAGO. Nov. 6. â At the wind
up of the State campaign the Repub
lican managers claim a plurality of
at least 120.000 for Charles Dineen.
the Republican candidate for Gover
nor. â¢ This estimate allows him 40,-000
In Cook County and . 80,000 outside.
In reaching these figures the State
leaders have discounted reports they
received from organizations down the
State. A poll of precincts outside of
Chicago has shown figures which
the men at headquarters have not
been able to believe. Allowing a large
discount for enthusiasm and "hopes,"
they place Dineen's figures outside of
Chicago at Â£0,000.
The poll of the State, which gave
larger figures, was the most thorough
ever undertaken in Illinois, with one
exception. It was made through as
complete an organization as the State
ever had. Outside of Chicago this poll
Ehows a vote of 124,320 for, Dineen
and Roosevelt. These figures indicate
an Increase of 6% per cent for the
Republican ticket and a decrease of
more than 9 per cent for the Demo
cratic ticket.
When the polltakers in the various
precincts have been taxed with be
ing too enthusiastic and not suffi
ciently careful, they have come back
at the men at headquarters with a re
iteration of their flgrures and the as
sertion that they were absolutely cor
rect.
One county rtiow.ed an increase of
60 .ppr cent in the Republican vote,
and stoutly defended Its figures when
they were challenged.
The State managers, however. In
making estimates, shade these poll re
fiults. They cut more than 40.000 off
the result predicted outside of Cook
County.

plies to one accusation:
The statement contained in yesterday's Ex

with having stated during the railway strike
of 1895 that the strikers should be killed. Is
an Infamous falsehood. I never uttered such

ningly devised falsehoods. Invented for politi
cal purpbaes. I regret that Mr. Bontz could
have found it In his heart to so grossly mis
represent me, particularly when during the

never received anything but-- kindness. WÂ«

tickets. - ''; -...-. â¢Â¦Â¦; ;
The Vice Presidential candidacy of
Senator Charles W. Fairbanks, the co
incident candidacy for re-election of
Senator Albert J. Beveridge and the
possibility "of the election of the Re
publican national ticket have injected
into the political situation in this State
a peculiar and unusual â¢ contingency.
The possible necessity for the election
of the two United States Senators has
been the incentive for the Democratic
State Committee to concentrate its.ef
forts on the legislative ticket. Many
prominent Democrats believe their
party. will make serious inroads upon
Republican strength" in the legislative
districts. On the other hand, Repub

suspicious partisan service.
GROVER CLEVELAND.
The laft place his friends or the friends of
civil service reform wtmld have thought of as
<n<Â» he could appropriately occupy was that of
chairman of the Republican National Commit
tee, and the laÂ« thing they could have ex-
I.Ttod him to do was to resign his well earned
Â»nd befitting Cabinet position to take such a
place-.
Mr. Cortniyou. before his selection as the
li'-ad of th>> partisan national committee, with
Â¦ II it Implies, was pre-eminentljr the best illus
tration the country afforded of the useful and
beneficial o}>erat;on of the civil service reform.
Avithout iniiurnce or powerful friends he earned
an hur. LK place in the public service through
civil service exairinati*!. He rose step by step
through his own merits to positions of the most
delicate and confidential character, and when
he was put 'at the head of an important and
nÂ«>w department of the Government and took a
I>l3e* among the members of the President's
Cabinet, I iÂ«liÂ«>ve there was not a right think

vaÂ» gratified by the opportunity afforded to
point to so convincing a Justification of the re
form.
From this arises my condemnation of the
â¢â¢lion cf Mr. Roosevelt In putting him at the
hmt ot the Republican National Committee,
and this has nothing to do with the question
as to wheiliT or not Mr. Cortelyou has or has
not improperly or otherwite importuned or ob

But why did the trusts contribute to the Re
publican canvass? "They were asked," says
tbe outspoken former Secretary. .
Did they think they were buying a Presi
dency, or were they content with the assur
ance from the Republican candidate of "a
square deal?" In either case, upon their own
testimony, thÂ« Republican candidate stands
to-day before his fellow countrymen as one
willing .and eager to accept for himself a
Presidency that has cost protected monopolies
the great' sum of $5,000,000.
Can $5,000,000 of trust money buy a Presi
dency? Can this sum, great as It is, contrib
uted In the hope of favors to be returned and
gratefully accepted as a necessary means- for
the gratification of personal ambition, suffice
to thwart the will of the American people?
We cannot, will not bow. before It. More
over, we have the cheering Intelligence to
convey to all Democratic, independent and pa
triotic citizens, that the most recent and
thorough canvasses of the doubtful States are
absolutely convincing that Judge Parker will
be elected."
FMlly appreciating the fact that within
forty-elrht hours the actual result will be
known, and keenly sensible of the responsibil
ity we assume, we declare our positive belief
that the Democratic candidates will receive
at least 270 votes in the electoral college.
We appeal to all patriotic citizen* to do
their duty to their country and participate In
the triumph of an unpurehasable people. ;: ,;
Five million dollars is the rum. More
could have been had If needed, but under the
present chairman's more careful direction it
was deemed sufficient / -
The only question remaining was how much
had been considered necessary. Fortunately,
even this Information was forthcoming. Simul
taneously with the preparation of the most ex
traordinary temperamental document, indica
tive of the keenest desperation, which has ever
emanated from th# White House, the candi
date's most intimate and trusted adviser, the
former Secretary of War, Just returned from
Washington, waa uttering another and more
detailed "defense" of his chief, in this city.
"The mere fact of contribution" he held to be
Inoffensive. His chief pride was In 'the'grewt
work acconipll&hed ' for so amall 'an expendi
ture. "Th<Â» fact is," he proudly declared, "that
it Is the smallest fund we have had for twelve
years â about one- half the Republican 'fund
when McKinley waa elected in 1890." -That
fund, it is well known, was, approximately, ten
million dollars. . Accepting these figures as
correct, therefore, "the Republican chairman
has had only about five million dollars at his
disposal. -Â¦â¢Â¦:.â¢â¢' - "Â¦ :
The chain is completeâ the trust contribu
tions not denied by either the candidate or
the chairman, unequivocally admitted, and the
amount plainly stated by the former Secretary
of War.
Neither he nor his chairman denied that con
tributions r.ad been accepted from the trusts,
for the simple fact waa undeniable and each
knew that it was susceptible of overwhelming
proof. The payments were "voluntary." not
forced; such, and such alone, was the burden of
denials, which were virtual admissions.
The sourcÂ« of supply of this great Republican
campaign fund Is no longer a matter of suspi
cion. The Republican candidate declared with
great vehemence that he had promised nothing
more than he may be pleased to consider "a
square deal" in return for campaign contribu
tion*. Tbe Republican chairman, he Ylgorous
ly asserted, had assured him more than once
that therÂ« had been no necessity for making di
rect pledge?; that it had been found possible
to obtain aU the money needed up to that
time, at any rate, without doing f Â«â¢.
The Democratic candidate. If elected, will be
absolutely free from obligation, direct or Im
plied, to any person or group of persons, other
than tha whole people, who shall have en
trusted to htm the maintenance of the welfare
of the republic. ...
This committee asks for Itself only so much
credit as such conduct of a canvass may merit,
but it does feel that both the party and
the country are to be' congratulated upon the
fact thai out of discordance and weakness has
twtn wrought a union of strength. The diffi
culties attendant upon this achievement are
well understood. At every turn, by every con
ceivable method, In every doubtful district of
every doubtful Stats the efforts which we main
tain to have been at least patriotic and know
to have been creditable to both the Â° candidate
and this committee have been met by an ava
lanche -of money. i
This committee has conducted a national
canvass in a manner. It believes, befitting the
dignity and integrity of the American people.
It his advanced no imaginative claims respect
ing results and has not accepted for use In the
campaign a single dollar from the tariff-bred
truvu, whose exactions have so greatly in
creased the cost of every necessary of life and
which are now contributing from their gains
great sums of money to perpetuate Republican
rule.

For his stand In this matter In behalf
of California Hayes was yesterday at
tacked by the Examiner. A local vision
ary by the name of Henning presented
to the Mercury In October an article
on the cured fruit industry, in which
he proposed to force the transconti
nental railroads to make the, freight
rates on dried fruit In boxes and bags'
when sent East the same. He then
claimed that Eastern dealers In fruits
would buy all their prunes in sacks and
pack them in boxes in^the East, since
with' the freight rates the same they
would not pay freight on the boxes,
paper lining or paper cartons, and the
increase in weight in processing, but
would take the prunes from the trays
after drying direct. East. The prunes
would then be packed In the East, and
all that labor which should be done in
California would be ' performed else
where. It was claimed that great good
would result to the growers, because
the dealer In the . East would be en
couraged to buy prunes In bags and
pack them there under his own brand.
In his letter published and approved
by the examiner Henning charged
that the prune market was confined to
six packers on the coast, 'that the
principal packing houses of the Santa
Clara Valley are on land owned by the
Southern Pacific and that there was
a combination between the railroad Â¦
and the packing houses to keep the'
freight rate on fruit In bags higher
than that on fruit In boxes, bo that
all the 'fruit would move in the latter
state. Henning closed his appeal by
suggesting that the growers strike
against the so called discriminating
rate in favor of boxed prunes.
The article was referred to E. A.
Hayes, who has a large interest in the
Mercury, and is one of the oldest and
largest prune growers In the valley.
The Examiner in its campaign of filth
against E.' A. Hayes published yester
day an article that has set the Santa
Clara" Valley buzzing with interest.
Were the ideas in the article as pub
lished and approved by the Examiner
carried out the greatest Industry em
ploying labor in the Santa Clara Valley
would be wiped out. With it would go
allied industries. Every town south of
Palo Alto to Holllster, including San
Jose and Santa Clara, would suffer ir
reparable damage. Every merchant and
every merchant's employes, property
owners and business men In general
would suffer, directly or' Indirectly.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars in
vested In packing-houses and packing
house machinery would be a total loss.
The thousands of working men and
women employed in packing fruit
would be thrown out of work. Yet the
Examiner approves of this, and thus
shows the utter sham and hollow insin
cerity of Its claim that it is the friend
of the workingmen.
To create a nonsensical argument to
influence the fruit growers against
Hayes it is willing to paralyze the
greatest labor employing industry in
California, one that exists In every val
ley In the State and is the chief sup
port of many of our most thriving cit
ies. With its disregard for the protec
tion of home labor that has marked
every step of Its free trade career. It
advocates the election of Wynn over
Hayes because the latter insists that
California grown fruit, for the benefit
of working men* and women and fruit
growers alike, must be packed In Cali

people ' in California packing-houses

izer in the Fifth. ' Dovener, Republi
can, is expected to win over Barnes in
the Wheeling district, the normal Re
publican majority being between 4000

a great effort to capture the Legisla

disaffection is aiding them materially.
DEMOCRATS HOWL "FRAUD."
Prunes go in -carload lots from Santa
Clara Valley to a thousand points in
the East. It would be impossible to
have a thousand packing houses there
to do the work that forty-five do here.
As a result tbe dealers in one or two
carloads would be at the mercy of the
dealer in large centers like New York
and Chicago who had packing houses.
Now he has the same freight rates
from San Jose as the larger dealer, but
under the Henning plan he would have
to pay anywhere from 51 to $10. per ton
additional local and handle the large
dealer's brand, which would tend to
discourage him in handling. It is In
comprehensible what folly has prompt
ed the Examiner to try to destrov thÂ«
prune-packing Industry of Santa Clara,
Sonoma, San Joaquin and* Sacramento
valleys; the ralsln-packing industry of
Fresno, the box-making' Industry of
the Sierra Nevadas and the'machinery
making of San Jose and San Francisco.
Hayes is firmly against this scheme of
destruction to promote the candidacy
of his opponent.
Further, he concluded that California
prunes and Santa Clara Valley prunes
would lose their individuality because
the dealers in the East packing them
under their own brands could mix
them as thev pleased. The strongest
argument against Henning's project, in
Hayes' mind, aside from the Inconceiv
able folly of destroying our packing in
dustry, was that the grower would be
at the mercy of tKe Eastern man, his
fruit would be much delayed- in mar
keting and his prunes would have to
pay heavy local freight rates in the
East.
AT MERCY OF EASTERNERS.
He investigated and found that in
stead of six packing houses there were
in the Santa Clara Valley alone fifty
cured fruit packing houses; that only
seven of these were on ground belong
ing to the railroad and these were not
the largest; that the packing houses
included those belonging to the
Mountain View Co-operative Associa
tion, the Sunnyvale Co-operative As
sociation, the Santa Clara County
Fruit Exchange, representing over 600
growers; the Campbell Fruit Growers"
Union, the Cupertino Association, the
Berryesaa Growers' Union, thÂ« East.
Side Growers' Union and the West
Side Growers' Association, represent
ing a very large proportion^ of the or
chard acreage of the valley. He found
I that many other packers were grow
ers as well as packers. He also de
cided that to ship Santa Clara Valley
prunes to the East In bags altogether
would gravely increase the danger of
loss from worms, since prunes, must
be processed with hot water to makÂ«
them proof against insect germination.
Instead of printing it to gain any
thoughtless votes as the Examiner has
done. Hayes gave it study, calling on
his fund of practical knowledge in the
fruit business. He decided that the
ideas advanced were impracticable,
and for the most part meretricious.

had some trouble with her husband :
about four years ago. He fell in love
with a woman named Eloise Parker of
Chicago, but his wife persuaded him to '
give her up. He was proprietor of a i
machinery plant and was a successful
workman. The wife says Bowers was
a money-maker and always command- I
ed a good salary. She thinks that if he
has really left her he has gone to Port
land, where he is acquainted.
There is a chance of there being a
woman in the case. The disappearance
of Mrs. Bowers' new clothing seems to
bear out this theory. Detective Cole
man, however, says he sees in the de
velopments a conspiracy that had its
birth in Chicago. The relatives of Mrs.
Bowers were opposed to Harley Bowers
and urged his wife to leave him. Thev
were the custodians of a few thousands
that remained of her fortune, and re- %
fused to allow the husband to handle
the money.
"I think that it is another Soeder
case," said Coleman. â¢ "When Bowers
found that he could not get the money
by peaceful means it was his intention
to kill her. Her kinsmen had her
money when she was in Chicago and
they would not! give It to him. so he i
put up a job to get her to come to'
California. I think the brothers are on
their way to Portland and will be cap- i
tured."

party for 150 "raw food babies" was
given in Harlem yesterday by Mr. and
Mrs. John H. Carroll to celebrate the
eleventh anniversary of the bhÂ«.a of
their daughter Irene, who was reared
on the physical culture plan.
There was no cake at this birthday
party â only raw wheat, raw vegetables,
nuts and a smack of apple juice to let
the little ones know the joys of life.
There were no frivolous pastimes,
such as clap in and clap out, postofflce
and droo the handkerchief. Instead,
the children amused one another with
feats of strength and exhibitions of
muscular* skill. There werÂ§_ "jiu jltsu
babies" and "natural system babies"
and "apparatus system babies," babies
representing all of the dozen other sys
tems of physical culture. Not one had
ever tasted of cooked food and all
turned up their noses at candy.

Behind all other explanations of the
Innst>ruck affair there is the racial
hatred between Italians and Austro-
Germans in the Italian provinces sub
ject to Austria, the latter element hav
ing vainly tried for five centuries to
Germanize the provinces. Austria's
refusal to establish art Italian faculty
in the University of Trieste has.. been
attributed to the fear that it would re
sult in the university becoming the cen
ter of an anti-Austrian propaganda.
The disturbances, it is alleged here,
were provoked by aggressions on the
part of the Germans.
The Cabinets of Vienna and Rome
are doing what they can to smooth over
the difficulty.
MIIiAN* SCENE OF CLASH.
MILAN, Nov. 6. â About 500 students
to-day gathered in the center of the
city crying "Down with Austria!" and
called to the balcony of his hotel the
Innsbruck correspondent of II Corriere
Delia Sera, who had just arrived from
that place after having been severely
maltreated by Germans. Subsequently
four Germans who were sitting in a
cafe began singing "The Watch on the
Rhine." Requests that they cease met
with further Insults and further decla
rations that the Italians were cowards.
A fight with sticks ensued and a num
ber were injured. The police restored
order.
AUSTRIAN' PRIME MINISTER
WHO IS DEALING WITH THE
DISORDERS AT INNSBRUCK.
Frank H. Cranford and his wife lived
at 335 Tenth avenue and left for the
East ten days ago. As they had only
resided In that locality a short time the
neighbors knew very little about them.
Cranford was a carpenter by occupa
tion.
VIENNA, Nov. 6.â Prime Minister
von Koeber this afternoon had a
stormy interview with Herr Erler.
vice burgomaster of Innsbruck, and
Herr Denschatte, leader of the Peo
ple's party. The Premier firmly" de
clined to close the Italian faculty of
the University of Innsbruck.
INNSBRUCK,, Nov. 6.â Disorders
were renewed late this evening. A
mob paraded the streets, whistling and
catcalling and throwing fireworks
under the feet of the horses of the
gendarmes, who were attempting to
disperse them. Reinforcements for the
gendarmes finally arrived, scattered
the rioters and closed the road to the
Imperial Palace to all traffic.
The body of the artist. Prezzey. who
was stabbed through the heart with a
bayonet during the rioting here the
night of November 3, was buried this
afternoon^ Perfect order was main
tained. A" strong force of gendarmes,
kept the route clear and large detach
ments of troops were held in reserve.
The City Council had decided that the
funeral should be at the public ex
pense and black nags were hung on all
public buildings. The coffin was fol
lowed to the cemetery by the burgo
master, members of the City Council,
the rector of the university, members
of the Academic Senate and students'
clubs carrying flags. After the funeral
crowds promenaded the streets sing
ing German patriotic songs.
ROME BLAMES GERMANS.
ROME, Nov. 6. â When Premier Gio
litti came into power a year ago he
found the relations between Italy and
Austria in a very disturbed condition
in consequence of the fact that anti-
Austrian demonstrations 1 had been tol
erated by Signor Zanardellu, his prede
cessor, who it is alleged winked at the
propaganda for the union with Italy of
the Italian provinces that are still sub
ject to Austria,
Signor Giolitti changed all this and
assured Austria she had nothing to fear
from Italy. This was publicly empha
sized by the meeting at Abazzia in
April last of Signor Tlttoni,* the Italian
Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Count
Goluchowski. the Austrian Chancellor.
However, Austria's denial of the re
quest of her Italian subjects for a na
tional university at Trieste led up to
the troubles at Innsbruck, which have
endangered the good relations between
the two governments. -
BANGOR, Me., Nov. 6.â There was
joy in the home of Richard S. Davis,
in the town of Brewer last night when
his daughter, Stella, now Mrs. Frank
Cranford of San Francisco, crossed her
father's threshold for the first time
since she was mysteriously kidnaped in
1869, then a 3-year-old girl.
At the time she disappeared the Da
vis family lived in Bangor. The kid
naping created great excitement at the
time. Mrs- Cranford was so young
when she was stolen that she has no
recollection of the circumstance. She
grew up with a family on the Pacific
Coast, with which she was left.
A long time after she was taken from
her home, a relative of the family ac
cidentally discovered a clew which
eventually led to the identification of
the lost child then grown â¢ up. She
married Frank Cranford of San Fran
cisco, who came East with his wife to
visit her home and relatives.
AIRSHIPS WILL
COMPETE TO-DAY
j ROME, Nov. 6.â The general election
j for members of the Chamber of Depu
ties took place to-day* and up to mid
night no serious incident had been re
ported. Results ascertained from about
I three-fifths of the constituencies show
| that the power of the extreme parties
â¢.has been diminished without, how
i ever, materially augmenting the num
j her of Ministerial followers, as most of
i the new recruits are Conservatives, who
' may be expected to soon abandon' Pre
\ mier Giolitti, a Liberal.
| Sonnino, the leader of the constitu
tional opposition, has lost some of his
followers, owing to the fact that Milan,
which formerly was represented by Ex
tremists, has elected two Conservatives,
one Clerical and two Socialist Econo
mists, one of whom, Turatl, was sup
ported even by non-Socialists. As Tu
rati, though a leader of the Social Econ
omists, condemned the general strike,
his election is regarded as a reply to
that strike.
Genoa, where the strike was most vio
*lent, overthrew the extremists.
Ferri, the Socialist leader, in most of
the forty constituencies gathered only
a few votes. The Clericals voted almost
everywhere for Conservative candi
dates. Further returns and second baf
lotings next Sunday may considerably
change the situation.

Since he gave us that brightly writ
ten musical comedy, "Three Little
Maids," Paul Rubens has been heard
from only as the author of certain "ad
ditional numbers" for works from other
pens. In collaboration with Colonel
Newnham-Davis, however, he has been
working on a new piece, which is now
finished and about to be produced by
George Edwardes. It is called "The
Mischief Maker," and will be given at
the Prince of Wales Theater- Colonel
Newnham-Davis, known heretofore
chiefly as an amusing writer about res
taurants and their patrons, is the lat
est son of Mars to turn his attention
to the stage, thus following in the
footsteps of Captain Marshall and Cap
tain Basil Hood.
MORE GLOOM FROM GORKI.
Maxim Gorki's new play, "Summer
Visitors," which the Russian drama
tist has just been reading to his
friends, may be given in London
eventually by some courageous soul,
but it Is not likely. For although
across Jhe North Sea they seem to en
joy somber plays, English folk do not
and Gorki's newest piece is even gloom
ier than his other works. The "Sum
mer Visitors" are the better classes of
Russian society, who, says the play
wright, are like holiday makers in the
country, always on the lookout for
fresh fields and new excitements. Gorki
declares that the life lived" in these
circles is like a bog which smothers all
the living strength of the rising gener
ation.
Unlike those in Gorki's other pieces,
the people of this one are all society
folk. The heroine is a young girl who
tries to reform her friends, but who
succumbs in the struggle which she has
undertaken. There is a typical Gorki
scene, in which, from her dying bed,
this girl gives a sort of lecture to her
relatives on the "canker gnawing at
Russian society." and Implores them
to renounce their fast life. The piece
will be given at the St. Petersburg
Dramatic Theater. Gorki's friends are
said to have been much impressed with
Its power.
CHARGES FOR AUTOGRAPH.
Paderewski has begun to charge
money for his autograph. The pianist
is new In Australia, but he writes to
a friend here that "the percentage of
autograph hunters is larger in the An
tipodes than in any other part of thÂ©
world." So, not long ago, he deter
mined to charge his Australian admir
ers half a crown, or sixty cents, apiece
for his autograph and he says that he
means to devote the proceeds to the
Chopin memorial fund at Warsaw.
"Le Grillon du Foyer" is a long way
from suggesting Dickens to the non
linguistic Anglo-Saxon, but that is the
title under which an adaptation of "The
Cricket On the Hearth" is being given
at the Paris Odeon. This Dickens play,
in which Toole made one of 'his greatest
successes and which Arthur Bourchier
revived in London last winter, is at thi3
writing delighting crowded houses at
the Latin quarter theater. Janvier plays
Caleb Plummer and Mile. Sylvie Is little
Dot. Both* are capital, and incidental
music by Massonet adds greatly to the
success of the piece.
One of Arthur Paterson's novels, "ThÂ»
King's Agent." has just been drama
tized by Edward Rose, whose play will
be given in London soon after Christ
mas.

The approach of the election furnish
ed a theme yesterday for many ser
vices In leading pulpits. Well-known
clergymen of divers denominations
pleaded with eloquence and force for
the patriotic observance of the duties
of good citizenship and inveighed
against bribery and other crimes
against the ballot.
The Rev. Francis M. Larkin. Ph.D..
spoke at the Grace Methodist Church
last night on "A National Civic Crime."
He said In part:
The battlefield to-day of Christian civiliza
tion 1b In the cities of our land. A few gen
erations ago it was in the ccuntry and on the
frontier. Hut the little red sehoolhouse and the
< hurch have won the victory in the rural dis
tricts. Changed industrial conditions have
made the modern city, with its great wealth
end great poverty; thÂ»y have produced the idle
classes ;a the plum end in the suburb. The
criminal, the vicious and the unfortunate flee
no more to the frontier, but to the city. Here
every crime seeks to flourish, in secret or with
thÂ» connivance of the officials.
The enemies of righteousness find their great
est ally in bribery. Thin is no ordinary crime.
It Is treason more vicious than the treason of
Benedict Arnold. K* betrayed one government
in another. But this civic crime barters every
thing dear to homÂ« and country in the interest
cf vice and crime. It means a regime of In
famy and threatens the destruction of cur
democracy. Thiscrimeis prevalent In all the city
joveraments of our land. Minneapolis and St.
l/v:!s have been stirred to action by the reve
iations of the last two years. San Francisco
hat had one revelation after another, yet our
ehaxne is Â«o great that there has b*en no gen
eral uprising of the people to purge our city.
Scandal after scandal has come to light, but
the people sleep on, and no one is sent to San
CJuemln. This is not k> much the fault of
those In polities as those out of politics.
The eplrit of bribery Influences us in cur
fcnsinese and cocial relations. We are bribed
by business success to leave politics alone.
TVÂ« are bribed hy our desire for social peace to
IK things run. We say. "Hush!" "What's
the use?" "We can't do anything." And our
Interests are bartered away by the worst ele
ments of t^ie city. The ancients hired men to
play the fool for them: we play the fool our
relres. It Ss time for San Francisco to awak*
to the enormity of the situation. When a
Mayor ceeks tlie election cf Superior Judges,
apparently in the interest of his own adminis
?ratlc!i. it i* time fcr the people to arouse
themselves.
A SACKED DUTY.
"The American Voter and His Rela
tion to the Saloon on Election Day"
â¢w~as the subject of a sermon preached
by the Rev. A. C. Bane at Howard-
FtreÂ»t Methodist Episcopal Church last
night. Among other things he said:
It is a great privilege to live in a republic
and to have a voice in the affairs of govern
ment. It is a sacred duty for every American
Citizen to be registered and to vote. The best
people should take the oeepÂ»?st interest in pol
itics from the caucus to the polls, and not
leave it to th* cyrrupt forces. The veil being
of the people and the will of God should mold
your political opinions. Moral questions
*hi>uld b* held to be of thÂ» first importance.
You should nfver neglct at the bailot to honor
God and to hit sin. Go<l observes your ballot.
The greatest moral issu*- before the Ameri
can p* r> l'ie to-day is the lega!lrÂ»d li<juor traf
fic. It is on outlawed business, but it has
more power tn politics than the church has.
What have we r-oir* tn. whÂ»n th? v.nrM busi
ness has the most power? It has intimidated
the pulpit, the nr"5s, -the politician and the
jfoople. It is Euch a demoralizing business
that it is forced t'Â» closf on election day. If
the Ealo^n t-hould close while we vote it ought
to <:l"sÂ« while we worship.
I call on you to vote for Judges ftnd lecis
lp.tor* vrh*Â» arÂ» not dominated by the saloon
nor by the political boss who is allied ""Ith
the saloon.
Th<-re is but one political party that has
dared to oppose the liquor traffic â the Prohi
bitinn rarty. It has a natiors.1 ticket in the
field, tivine each Oirimian a chance to vote
a<-eordins to a Christian conscierii-e. Chris
tians often pray. tnlk. resolve and wii=h arsinst
the RiUoon and then when thfy have an oppor
tunity to vote against the saloon. | Vie consist
ent. The saloon makff the tnnr important
issue in American politics. IV>n't fee afraid of
'hrowir- away your vote. Lincoln said. "An
honest vote is n>=ver thrown away, even if your
man is not elected."
I would not say a word against our Fple-ndid
Prri<i<*nt. who is a candidate for re-election,
nor agalnrt that other F;,!endid man who is
his chief opponent, but I would advise Chris
tum men to cast th"ir votes in the way that
Â¦will Ftrtko thÂ» hardest Mow to that mnjt cor
rupt. dÂ»bauchir.g and <1--:=tnictivÂ» institution
5n America â thÂ» organized liquor traffic â for
eo they win most jrtorify God.
THE UETTEU CITY.
The Rev. E. L. Walz, jiastor of the
Fourth Congregational Church, sooke
lapt nifrht on "The Better City." He
said in part:
Too lonj hsve we been patiently submissive
to Â«vil and to men who are not willing to
firht against that which diÂ«irracy>s a city and
hams its inhabitants r.f nil a^f-s and condi
tions. ThÂ« time is ripe for ac(rreBfiive action.
The right sort of man aro voluntfrinc. The
crrurch Is awjkfninr. Practical reforms are
certain to corns soon. Men, and women, too,
can do their part in this grand movement
Nothing is impossible If it ought to be done.
Strength Is promised to all who shall dare and
do. Let us remember that the Builder and
Maker of every "better city" is God, who,
filling men's hearts' with goodness, sincerity
and zeal. Is <\tn now working In the midst
of us. Every vote cast for the , best men
and measures is a stone In the foundation of
the "better city."
The Rev. George A. Hough, pastor of
the California Street Methodist Epis
copal Church, speaking of the duty of
citizenship, last night, said:
The need of the hour is not more agitation,
but a deepening sense of the dignity of citi
zenship and of the importance of an honest
I and intelligent exercise of its privilege. .The
ballot should not be a mere means for the
obtaining of a Job for ourselves or for some
friend, but should be the deliberate declara
tion of a conviction as to the policy of gov
ernment. It should be an honest and fear-
S less expression of an opinion.
j The salvation of the country is not in party
j fealty, but In honest ar.d independent vot
| ing. Truth Is often with the minority. We
. thould never endorse a pernicious principle,
though it be the watchword of our favorite
party. We should never vote for a man for
public office whom we would not be willing
to trust with our own private affairs.
i THE CHURCH IX POLITICS.
The Rev. F. A. Keast, in his sermon
to a large congregation at Epworth
Methodist Episcopal Church last nieht.
I said among other things:
' It Is not the province of the church to tell
you to whit party you should belong, cr for
whom you should vote. But the Christian
voter should be actuated by certain principles.
As the ballot touches the life threads cf the
republic, the Christian should by all means
exercise his powers of citizenship. Because
of the prevalence of corruption! In politics
many good people have washed their hands
cf all things political.
This is what the saloonkeeper and corrupt
politician desire. When the churches threat
ened to use thtir influence against those Su
pervisors who voted for the opening of Ingle
j side one cf them said: "The mlniFters would
! not influence their people politically." They
j would have us washing our hands of these
I things and leave the government to them.
I When they do what Is right we will applaud
them. When they do what Is wrong we will
condemn them. The church must become a
terror to evil doers.
"Political Parties and Their Poli
cies" was the subject of the sermon
given at Simpson Memorial Methodist
Church last night by the Rev. James
H. N. Williams, who said in part:
In the early days of party growth, while
campaigns were bitterly fought out, and some
times on the lines of prejudice, accusation
and abuse, patriotism still had a prominent
place, exerting its strong and beneficent In
fluence.
The "boss" was not yet born â it would have
been a good thing for the country had he. as
the Scotch say, "died a-bornin'." and the
spoil* system had not yet come into being. The
country's good was the highest actuating mo
tive. TherÂ» were to grafters in office such as
control San Francisco to-day.
Had our Mayor lived in these times he
would never have dropped his musical baton
nor been invited to awsume the executive
headship of a city.
On Tuesday the American ballot-box will
VwÂ» open. Every American citizen should take
his place there with his conscience untram
m^led and his purpose firmly set to serve his
country. guides by his best jmJjrment without
regard to other considerations. The man who
tloes that may not vote my ticket, but he is a
true man. Swallcw and Carroll are my party
candidates, but doubtless Theodore Roonevelt
will be our next President, an<i may God bless
him with health, strength and wisdom.

DECORAH, Iowa, Nov. 6. â Profes
sor T. I. GIfford is under arrest here
and a charge of murder in the first
de.gree has been filed against him on
account of the death of H. A. Blge

showed that O'Brien had not walked
over the cliff, but had fallen over the j
edge. The fall probably broke his neck j
and fractured the skull. The Coron

O'Brien for a footpad and shot at him !
and that O'Brien, running, away, j
stumbled at the edge of the canyon and
fell to his death.

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 6. â "Los An

national ticket a plurality of more
than 15,000 next Tuesday, and.lt may
exceed this figure by 2000. We pro
pose to keep the Republican banner
which we won two years ago by cast
ing the vote which made Pardee Gov
ernor." This is the statement made
to-day by Chairman Bradner W. Lee
of the Republican County Central
Committee.
There is reason for the statement.
For two years the Republican clubs
of Los Anjreles County have kept up
active organization. Meetings were
held at regular intervals and in a quiet
but effective way some careful polit
ical work has been done. A close
watch has been kept and advantage
taken of everything which would
strengthen the Republican cause, and
the result of that work will be shown
next Tuesday. The one aim of the
party, workers has been to break all
previous records, and so certain is it
that the result will be that the Dem
ocrats have conducted only a half
hearted campaign.

ALAMEDA, Nov. 6.â Chief F. K.
Krauth's plan for the disbanding of the
three remaining volunteer hose compa
nies of the fire department and their
reorganization upon a paid basis will
come before the City Trustees to-mor
row night for action. It is recommend
ed by the Chief that the hose compa
nies, which now consist of fifteen or
more men and which are allowed $35 a
month by the city, hereafter consist of
four men, one to be designated as fore
man. Each foreman will be allowed $6
for responding to alarms within his
district and $3 for responding to alarms
without his district. The men of the
companies will be paid $5 each for re
sponding to alarms within their dis
trict and one-half of that amount for
outside alarms. Nothing will be al
lowed for responding to false alarms.
Chief Krauth also suggests that the
two present district engineers be abol
ished and that the foreman of one of
the hose companies stationed east of
Grand street be authorized to act as
assistant engineer when necessary, and
the foreman of one of the compa
nies located west of Grand street be
similarly empowered.
Chief Krauth's plan of reorganization
provides for a department of thirty-six
men, as follows: One chief engineer,
one engineer of steam fire engine, seven
drivers, three chemical extra men, six
teen hosemen and eight truckmen.

C. Z. Reed, formerly a well-known
real estate dealer of Minneapolis,
Minn., has Just bought out the firm of
Bhoeam & Campbell, whose place or
business was at 468 Eleventh street.
Mr. Reed will occupy the same offices.
BERKELEY, Nov. 6. â Joseph J. Ma
son, a prominent real estate broker of
Berkeley, reports that within the last
thirty davs he has sold thirty lots in
the Fairview tract, which was recently
opened.
I believe, however, that the coming winter
will see more and larger deals in Oakland real
estate than have ever before been Known In
this city.
Our business has been confined for the last
three weeks to sales of small residence proper
ties, but I think that after the result of the
election is known business will at once pick up.
Prospective purchasers of business property
seem inclined to wait until after the election
before closing large deals and I now have one
or two Important transactions on hand which I
will not bo able to complete for a couple of
weeks.
There Is little doubt that the campaign has
caused a marked lull In the real estate market.
This will" probably continue until after next
week. As soon as the Presidential question is
settled I believe the market will resume Its
wonted activity, and present conditions Indi
cate that all kinds of property, both for busi
ness and residences, will find ready sale at ex
cellent prices.
During the last few months there has been a
considerable Increase In the demand for East
Oakland property. That* section,- which has
been practically dead for several years, has
apparently begun to move again. I have at
present several large transactions on hand,
which I expect to close immediately after the
election.
E. J. Stewart of E. J. Stewart & Co.
said:
Real estate dealers generally expect
that business will Increase immediately
after election. E. P. Vandercook, pres
ident of the E. P. Vandercook Com
pany, In discussing the present condi
tion of the market said:
Representatives of Oakland real es
tate firms have recently been making
Inquiries from the railway companies
as to the number of visitors expected in
California during tho coming winter,
as indicated by the inquiry for and
sale of tickets in the East. It has been
learned that the passenger depart
ments expect heavier traffic during the
winter than ever before. Real estate
dealers expect that many of these vis
itors will decide to locate permanently
in California, and -no. doubt a large
number of the newcomers will choose
Oakland as the place In which to es
tablish homes, both on account of its
natural advantages, climatic and
otherwise, and also on account of its
proximity to San Francisco, the busi
ness center of the State.
With the exception of what dealers
term small business, such as the sale of
the cheaper residence properties and
the usual renting business, there has
been little activity in the local real es
tate market during the week, the ap
proaching Presidential election having
caused a lull in larger transactions.
Several real estate men report large
transactions pending, which will not be
completed until after the election. The
influence of the political campaign on
the realty market has not been felt to
any extent in building circles, and con
struction work has been begun recent
ly on several new buildings, notably a
large apartment house at Nineteenth
and Franklin streets and another at
San Pablo avenue and Nineteenth
street. The construction of houses and
cottages in all parts of the city con
tinues with unabated activity, and
while nearly all the contractors are
hastening their work as much as possi
ble before the steady rains set in. many
have begun the erection of small
houses within the week.
These houses are being built for new
comers to Oakland, who have been un
able to find suitable houses for rent
and have decided to purchase property
and build at once rather than spend
the winter in hotels or apartment
houses. There are practically no
houses to be had in desirable locations
at less than 535 a month. Those that
rent for $15 to $25 In most cases are at
a considerable distance from street car
and railway lines. Much land has re
cently been purchased by speculators,
who intend to build homes, for the pur
pose of selling or renting.
Plans have Just been completed for a
large three-story apartment house at
Telegraph avenue and Twentieth
street on the property owned by Dr. W.
D. Huntlngton. The excavating for the
foundation will begin as soon as the
rainy season ends. The new building
will be erected bv a corporation of
which Dr. Huntington is one of the
members.

BERKELEY, Nov. 6.â President Ben
jamin Ide Wheeler, who styled the re
cent rebellion of students against the
order Issued by Captain J. T. Nance,
military Instructor, requiring them to
march in schoolboy fashion into his
classroom, as something less than an
"ebullition,'' ' practically ignoring the
riot on the campus attending the order,
is now called upon by the Occident
Magazine, the conservative and in
fluential student publication of the
university, to make a move in the
affair, even at this late day, in order to
preserve senior class control.
The riot in question, when Professor
Setchell was pelted with clods of grass
and mud while trying to au'ell it,
stirred the college, the town and many
parts of the State, but Professor
Wheeler apparently deemed it best to
Ignore the affair.
He will be informed, to-morrow in an
Occident editorial dealing exhaus
tively with the matter that if "senior
control," ' supposed to be a favorite
measure of the university president, is
to endure, then the president must in
terpose and checkmate the obnoxious
order issued by the military instructor.
To-morrqw the university magazine
will say in its leading editorial:
Fredrick lives with his parents on
Fruitvale avenue, near the Southern
Pacific Company's station. He and
Miller were arrested last week for
smashing signs and damaging proper
ty in Fruitvale. They had been held
on charges of malicious mischief.
Newell, 14 years old. and Brewis, 17
years -old. are waiting examination in
the Juvenile Court on charges of bur
glary. They were arrested for the
theft of articles from Gember & Hill's
second-hand store, 447 San Pablo ave
nue, on October 18. It is charged that
the pair hid in the place until it was
closed for the (night and then ransack
ed the shop.
The plank, opened window and bent
bars told the story. Fredrick's cell
mate? were sent into another section
of the jail and deputies were sent out
to hunt the runaway. The escape oc

evening.
stole toward the front of the Jail. There
he let himself down to the ground by
sliding along a series of telephone
wires. He was light enough to lower
himself on this frail support without
tearing the lines away from their fas
tenings. Meantime, those left behind
had discovered that the opening in the
bars was not big enough for them.
They had not time to pry the rods to
make a wider aperture before the ab
sence of Fredrick was noticed and the
flight disclosed to the jailers.
OAKLAND, Nov. (5.â With coolness
and a deliberation that would have done
credit to an older head, Arthur Fred
erick. 12 years of age, escaped last
right from the County Jail in a manner
daring enough to delight the boldest
kind of a prison bird.
To be sure. Arthur had help when he
made his flight for freedom, but the
accomplices were youngster?, all about
his own age. There were four in the
plot, but young Fredrick was the only
one who got away. His confederates
were Raymond Miller, Fred Newell and
Harry Brewis.
The boys were confined in the
women's department of the jail, a large
room on the upper floor. Jailer Harry
<"lark had bunched them there in the
absence of women prisoners. Taking
advantage of the eituation, Fredrick
plotted with his companions to break
out. The four broke a plank off a cell
partition and pried apart bars on one
of the windows that fare the rear of
the jail. After bending the sc-ft iron
upripnts. they cut or tore away a wire
screen from its fastenings. Arthur
managed to crowd his slender body
through the bars. Then he climbed up
the Iron braces that held the wooden
shutters around the windows, but away
from them far enough to leave space
for him to raise himself to- the gutter
s round the roof eaves.

Prospective Purchasers Show

Close of the Campaign
Last Wednesday an order was enforced to
make tho seniors in military 2A form in sec
tions with monitors, outside North Hall, and
march double file to their classroom. All that
was needed to supply the general kindergarten
effect was a teacher to tap a bell, and for this
some wag substituted a youngster. The whole
affair appealed to the college as so ridiculous
that the carrying out of the order could not
be taken seriously. Xo one need ever hop* to
see the order taken seriously.
If the order had merely been taken aa tho
huge Joke it Is, no one could object. If there
bad been nothing beyond harmless Joshing of
the seniors so formed in line and no Interfer
ence with the continuance of a recitation, the
resnlts of the affair would have donÂ© no in
jury bexond a decided blow at senior control,
which President Wheeler and Professor Cory,
in the light of past statements, must consider
as most gravely hurtful. But this was not all
that happened. Many lower classmen lost
control of themselves, acted as rowdies and
proved that we have among us not a few cow
ards who lurk in obscurity on the outskirts of
a crowd to Jeer and sling mud with a coward Â»
bravery As to the evil of the order, it means
the death of senior control, since that move
ment depends wholly upon the dignity of the
senior men and herein the seniors are held up
to the gibes of those they are to guide. It
means that military 2A will create a spirit of
antagonism between Instructor and student,
which is bound to exist, believing as we do
that the present action Is Justified. It means
that Captain Nance, whether he issued the
order himself or followed dictates from
Washington, will be disliked by col lege men
and that the military department will not re
ceive student support.
his influence. We believe neither thÂ» students
to be wholly right nor the military depart
ment. But each should gladly give in to re
store amicable relations. There must be a
right way. The present way la certainly a
wrong way.

The captain Is unable to estimate the
strength of the garrison, but he says
that everybody at Vladivostok seems to
be either an officer or an ordinary

If the Japanese make an attempt

are obliged, however, to maintain a

ropatkin breaking through their line
and carrying the war to their rear.
There is considerable evidence to in
dicate that the Japanese will make
every effort to force the Russians out
of Mukden, not only for the moral ef
fect on Europe but on the Chinese as
well. Mukden is extremely important
to them as winter quarters.
The Japanese continue to ' receive
reinforcements and it' is believed by
Russian military men that their ad
vancing awaits only the arrival of suf
ficient men.
St. Petersburg Believes Last Battle of
Year Has Been Fought.
ST PETERSBURG, Nov. 6. â The
army organ to-day publishes a long
list of new commanders in the Far
East, including the appointments of
Generals Linevitch and Kaulbars to the
First and Third armies respectively.
Generals Kutnevich and Selivanoff will
command the Twenty-second and Thir
ty-seventh divisions of the First Corps,
whose chief. General Meyendorff, Is re
signing on account of ill health. Gen
eral Slouchevesky, commander of the
Tenth Corps, also has resigned and it
is expected that he will be succeeded
by General Jzerpitsky.
The sweeping character of these
changes may imply that there is no
intention on General Kuropatkin's part
to assume the offensive during this
year's campaign, unless an exceedingly
favorable opportunity offer. Indeed, It
begins to look like a deadlock below
Mukden for the winter unless Port
Arthur fall or the Japanese abandon
the idea of renewing the assault upon
the fortress there and settle down to
a regular siege, either of which would
release enough troops to give the pre
ponderance necessary to try to force
the Russians out of Mukden. In fact,
the latest dispatches from the front in
dicate that some such move is prepar
ing, though the best opinion at the
War Office holds to the view that there
is not likely to be another big battle
this year, one of the indications point
ed out being the departure of many
military attaches for the winter.
General Orloff, whom General Kuro
patkin blamed for the Russian reverse
at Liaoyangr, declares in the course of
an interview published in the Xovoe
Vremya to-day that he obeyed General
Stakelberg's orders in making the
much criticized attack, in which his
division was decimated and he himself
wounded. General Kuropatkin appar
ently is convinced that Orloff was not
to blame, and the order detaching him

LONDON, Nov. 7. â Special dispatches
from Chefu and Tientsin report that
the defenders of Port Arthur have re
tired to the Liaoti Hills fort, where
they are holding out desperately, en
trenched and with ten guns of large
caliber. Many Russians, the corre
spondents assert, are deserting and
surrendering. The Japanese, it is add
ed, are advancing with irresistible
energy.
More reliable reports do not confirm
these statements, but the Tokio report
of the capture of Wantai Hill, a domi
nating fort within two miles of the
railway terminus, shows that the Jap
anese are making ra_pid strides.
Bennett Burleigh, the Daily Tele
graph's correspondent, reports from
Chefu that there was no fighting on
the nisht of November 5. The troops
of the Mikado, he says, have frequently
stolen into the native town of Port Ar
thur after dark, but invariably were
driven out at daylight with heavy
losses. The Japanese have four large
forts facing the Russian works on Rih
lung Mountain and Shanshu Mountain,
where thev are mounting naval guns
on stone foundations.
Mukden dispatches to Berlin state
that the Russian commanders are pre
paring their men to hear of the fall of
Port Arthur.

GRANTS PASS. Ore., Nov. 6.â News
was brought to this city this morning
of a shooting affray at Williams, Ore.,
eighteen miles south of here, last night.
W. D. Shoemake, TO years of age, shot
and instantly killed his son-in-law,
Oliver Sargent.
The old man has been living with his
son-in-law for several years and the
two have frequently quarreled. Last
night they disputed over a mining
claim and Shoemake grew infuriated
and getting a shotgun sent the con
tents of both barrels of the weapon
into the younger man's back. Mrs.
Sargent and her children fled and
alarmed the neighbors, but the old man
barred the doors and windows and kept
every one away at the point of his
gun.
To-day Sheriff Lewis and several
deputies went out and. after some little
skirmishing, succeeded in taking the
old man into custody.

Infuriated Old Man Slays
His Daughter's Husband
by Shooting Him in Back
The whaling bark Belvedere came
into port late Saturday evening, twen
ty-three days from Fox Island, with
5IIS0 pounds of bone, her season's
catch in the northern seas. The Bel
vedere, her nams associated with the
ideal of Â«.LiÂ£sic symmetry, is the pret
tiest -whale vessel that haunts the Arc
tic. Her iofty, tapering spars, spring
ing from a graceful hull, she presents
the picture of a dainty little clipper.
She can spread a volume of sail, but
supplied with her strong engines she
ii doubly fitted tot reaching into the
farther north fur the oil-bearing
quarry.
However, luck has been against the
Apollo Belvedere of a bark. The pro
peller tried to grind into a cake of ice
:n Bering Sea during the first of the
season, and, not succeeding, parted
company with the shaft. Captain Til
ton, knowing the sailing qualities of
his vessel, hauled fires, put the useless
engines out of commission and set sail
for the Arctic. It seemed that with
that propeller vent fair weather, and
the Belvedere began a fight with the
elements that lasted With short inter
missions till she had cut out the final
piece of bone and cleaned up for home.
Head winds and all degrees of unfa
vorable winds, high seas and all kinds
of disagreeable seas assaulted the
eteamer that could not steam, but
she never lost a spar nor a sail. Be
fore the propeller dropped down to
the bottom of Bering Sea the bark had
taken one whale. After she had brave
ly tackled the Arctic under sail she
took another and these two prizes
netted her 5" SO pounds of bone.
About the middle of October the
bark sailed for Sa.n Francisco and the
v.inds that had worried her in the
north followed her down the latitudes.
She failed over the spot where the
propeller was lying in its muddy bed.
with a gale trying to rip the canvas
rTi the yards. A huge sea came over
the starboard rail one day and caught
the cook, Jackson E. Townsend, as he
vaÂ« go:r.Â£ forward to heave overboard
a pan of potato peelings. The luckless
man was f.ur.g against the port bul
warks, heaved back to the starboard
with the roll of the bark and thrown
a grain across the deck and jammed un
der a heavy spar, where he la"y help
less. The succeeding waves that
hoarded the vessel and passed in turn
over the side would have carried him
into the sea for all time, but he was
fastened under the spare mast that
lay along the deck. No one could help
h:rn then, as all hands were busy hold
tng on and fighting the boarding seas.
Finally Townsend was with diffi
culty extracted from under the timber
ar.d carried below, where it was found
that his left leg was broken at the
ankle. Captain Tllton had him taken
to the cabin, and, with the assistance
cf the injured cook, who is evidently a
nervy fellow, the skipper set the frac
tured bones, splinted up the limb,
bandaged the foot in place, and so has
proved himself to be not only a thor
ough seaman, saving his disabled ship
in a continuous gale, but also a first
rlass emergency surgeon, saving the
unfortunate man's leg. He did not
have four years in a medical college
nor four years in a naval academy,
but he is a handy man for a' that.
For fourteen days the skipper has at
tended to his disabled cook stretched
out in the cabin and navigated over
stormy seas safely toward port the
steamer that could not steam.
As the Belvedere was making port
Saturday nijrht under sail she became
becalmed off Point Bonita. A boat
was lowered and sent into the harbor
Â»r.d a tug summoned. The Reliance of
the Spreckels Company responded and
the bark was towed into the bay.

this from what he saw at a baptism of

"so that to immerse the candidates
they were obliged to cut away the ice.
It happened that when one of the fe
male converts was dipped back into the
water the cold made her squirm about
and in a moment she had slipped from
the preacher's hands and was down the
stream under the ice. The preacher,
however, was not disconcerted. Look

THE DEPARTED SISTER
The Democrats should have waged
this campaign, so far as the tariff is
concerned, against the abuses, nof
against the policy of protection. It
was a big, bad blunder to declare that
"protection Is robbery." It cut the
party loose from any bond of sympathy
with Republican tariff revisionists and
it declared a doctrine that is foreign
to the views and feelings of a ma
jority of Democrats. All the conser
vative utterances that . followed the
"robbery" declaration in the' text of
the platform and in Judge Parker's
frank deliverances cannot antidote that
outburst of passion â Washington Post.

Of course our Eastern friends are wont to become somewhat
peevish when they huddle about the big Franklin stove and read
of Ophir roses and surf bathing out here on our coast. In the in
tervals between damming up burst water pipes they ejaculate
somewhat testily that they are getting tired of all this land-of
sunshine talk and they turn to face the frightened mercury in the
tube with countenances stamped with patriotic resignation to the
vagaries of their own climate.
Remember, though, we do not urge a visit to California in the
winter : we only suggest. The matter is too obvious for discussion. If
one would rather shovel tons of hard coal into a stove for fdur
months than eat strawberries under a rose tree, that is his privilege.
We only very modestly point to sapphire skies, billowy green hills
and riotous acres of vivid wild flowers with the heartily spoken as-
Eurance that there is enough for all and to spare.

Such is the trade situation this fall. It could hardly be better.
There are no disquieting signs anywhere. In finance, stock and bond
investments, railway earnings, manufacturing returns, farm prod
ucts, general merchandising, crop prospects, collections and failure
records we find the same cheerful reports. Business is in excellent
condition, and bids fair to continue so.
LAST week was remarkable from a business standpoint. With a
Presidential election only a few days off the record for the week
was in almost all respects ahead of that for the corresponding
week last year. There was an increase in the volume of business,
according to the bank clearings, of 5.2 per cent, the failures were
only 239 against 246 last year, 10,000 Eastern cotton-mill hands re
sumed work, some iron and steel products were advanced in price,
an improvement in collections was reported by the mercantile agen
cies, while the October railway earnings showed an increase of 7.6
per cent and the foreign exports from New York gained $789,276 and
the imports fell off $297,752. *
For the week immediately preceding a Presidential election it
was a record-breaker. The usual apathy of an ante-election week
was nowhere visisible. Instead there was a feeling of buoyancy all
over the country. Of the seventeen most prominent cities only four
â Cincinnati, Kansas City, Cleveland and New Orleans â showed a
rjecrease in bank clearings, and they were all small, the largest being
6.1 per cent at Milwaukee. The clearings themselves were record
figures, mounting up to an aggregate of $2,854,750,000. When it is
considered that for some years past $2,000,000,000 has been a good
average volume for these clearings, the gain in business last week
becomes apparent. For months during the early part of this year
they stood along in the neighborhood of $1,800,000,000. Here, then,
is an apparent gain of 50 per cent this fall over the spring and sum
mer months. Of course, considerable of this gain is to be credited
to the greatly enlarged trading on the New York Stock Exchange, but
it must also be remembered that this increased trading in the stock
market has been based wholly on the improved business conditions
throughout the country, so the increase on the Exchange was merely
a consequence of the expansion in general business. Had business
not made its marked improvement there would have been no in
creased trading in the stock market. One proves the other.
A survey of the business field in detail is corroborative of the
statements above. Pittsburg, with a gain in bank clearings of 284
per cent, affirms the reports of a pronounced improvement in the
iron and steel trades. Philadelphia, with a gain of 244 per cent,
testifies to increased activity in the textile industries. Minneapolis,
with a gain of 15.6 per cent, shows an improved movement in wheat
and flour over last year. Baltimore, with an increase of 17.7 per
cent, indicates just so much expansion in exports of general mer
chandise. San Francisco, with a small increase of 34 per cent, saves
her distance, and that is about all. Still, it places our city on the
right side of the exhibit. New York shows an increase of 30 per
cent. And so it runs all along the line.
Pursuing the detail further we find an active market for hides
end leather, with prices higher than a month ago; a brisk movement
in raw wool, which has been passing out of raisers' hands at a rapid
pace ; large crops of corn and cotton, with an excellent demand for
both at good prices ; high quotations for wheat, which is bringing the
growers large retiyrns; general expansion in many lines of manu
factured goods ; labor fully employed everywhere, except where the
workmen have struck for better terms for themselves, and an abun
dance of money, which has permitted the movement of the crops
without Governmental assistance, and with no strain whatever upon
the banks. In brief, not for years has the financial and commercial
situation been better at this time of the year, and as far as the
movement of crops is concerned it has not been as encouraging as it
has this fall. A decline in European exchange during the past week
shows that the balance of foreign trade is again running in our
favor. Almost every line of business in the country shows an expan
sion, and the only prominent exception is provisions, which are quiet
throughout the West.
REMARKABLE ANTE-ELECTION WEEK.
I "The tendency of civilization seems
to be toward comparatively late and
few marriages. One can almost Judge
Â«f the advancement (!) of a people as
a whole by the number ' of single
women. Females among savage races,
as in the animal kingdom, are not al
lowed to remain unmated. It is an
unusual thing in these days for a well
bred girl to marry under 20. In our
mothers' day such a course was emi
nently proper and in our grandmothers'
time girls married at 15 or 16.
"These figures would seem to confirm
the worst fears of those who, forty
years ago, opposed the admission of
women to college. It is difficult to
make comparisons, because so many
circumstances enter into the question
of marriage. College women come from
all sections of the country and from
most diverse social and pecuniary en
vironment. The rate here given is un
doubtedly less than that for the whole
female population of the country, but
perhaps not less than might be ex
pected for a specialized and highly ed
ucated class."
It will be seen that the writer Is put
on her defense even when the statis
tics are stretched to 60 per cent. But
the statistics for thirty years lie be
tween 42 and 53 per cent. None the less
the following arguments will be found
satisfactory:
Miss Abbott comments as follows:
"Of graduates of the first ten classes,
whose average age now would be from
50 to 60, 56 per cent have never mar
ried. It Is quite possible that some of
the living members may marry yet, but
making allowance for sporadic cases, 60
per cent would probably include the
complete marriage record of graduates
of this period.
"Such are the facts as to matrimony,
namely, that of the 700 women who- left
Vassar previous to 1886 and who would
now show a minimum age average of
40 years, only a few. over one-half are
now married, and of those who are
married the average family Is less than
two children."
- "During the thirty years from 1867 to
1896. 1302 women have graduated from
Vassar. Of these, Including 118 since
deceased, 541 were or had been mar
ried in 1900. being 41% per cent. That
means that less than half 'adopted
matrimony as a profession." Taking
only twenty years, all the graduates of
which may be assumed to have reach
ed marriageable years (they would
average from 36 to 56), one finds that
out of 701, 272 were married, a pro
portion of 53 per cent. This is still
only a little over one-half.
"The number of children from these
372 marriages of full-grown graduates
was 656 in 1900. an average of less than
two per family. But ''since 131 of these
children were born in twenty-eight
families (an average of over four), the
average for the bulk of the graduates
was only one and a half child per mar
riage.
says:
"The statistics for 18S7-1896. which
show only twenty-eight marriages per
100 graduates, with an average of less
than one child per marriage, are 'ob
vioWy incomplete* because half the
members were under 30 in 1900.
rHAT less than half the young
women who' graduate from Vas
sar College marry is shown by
Frances M. Abbott in a recent article
in the Popular Monthly. Miss Abbott

"The Prison of the Ten Thousand
is the name given by the wancJerinx
Arabs of the district across Jordan to
the fortress monastery of Mar Saba,
on the Dead Sea. Not many years ago
there were actually ten thousand
monks living in this grim retreat, and
even to-day there are more than a
thousand left. The monastery is one
of the oldest in the world, havinsr beea
founded about thirteen hundred year*
ago by Eutheymius.
The Empress Eudoxla formed a ro
mantic attachment for this stern old
anchorite, and built near by a tower,
which still exists, from which she
could watch him at a distance. True
to his vow, Euthymius utterly refused
to see or hear the voice of a woman.
Now the tower is Inhabited by a
watchman, who keeps guard against
the incursions of prowling Arabs.
Twice during the last year the place
has been raided by hordes from the
desert. The monks who live there to
'. day are the most rigorous of any rn
the Greek church. They pass their
lives In everlasting penance, without
; hope of pleasure or cheerful Incident.
Many of them go mad from the horror
and desolation of their surroundinars.
No woman is permitted %p come within

When Montana City burned some
strange facts concerning its inhabitants
came to light. The town, which held
at the time about five thousand Inhabi
tants, was occupied only by less than
a hundred Chinamen, who lived bv
working the tailings of a once valuable
mine. Small wonder that the fire raead
for days till the town was reduced to
ashes. It Is said that for years no
woman had been seen in that once
prosperous town. %
Another Far "Western settlement

too, was. once a mining town and has
many fine buildings, but the ore rave

became a resort for escaped criminals
and outlaws, who ara practically all
men. There are said to have been
three hundred of them in all. murder
ers and desperadoes every one. But as
there Is. no port or railway anywhere
near, they are entirely isolated and
practically prisoners.

afternoon when he visited the elephant
house and stood in front of the stalls,
talking in loud tones. His remarks
were apparently addressed to the ani

Ely frightened a little girl by trying
to hurl her under the feet of one of
the elephants. The fence in front of
the stalls prevented him from carry

ENGAGEMENTS.
Brown eased the. inquirer's appre
hensions about the supply by assuring
him that taking out all the large
acreage that would be reclaimed there
would still remain something like a
million acres of rich tule producing
land yielding a crop every spring.
A few days ago the Chicago man
reappeared jit the San Joaquin booth,
carrying a quantity of soft fiber. It
was the tules after going through the
decorticating process. The fiber looked
like a dark grade of. flax.
"There's many a fortune in these
tules if you have enough of them." he
said. "I can make rope and twine
good enough for most any purpose
from them at a cost below what inanu
facturers of such grades of goods now
pay for their raw ' material. In the
same factory, from these tules could be
made common grades of mattinff. wood
pulp paper of the best quality and
covers for wine bottles. The only
question is, have you enough of the
tules?"
Brown described the tule as best he
could and then remembered that some
of the bottles holding exhibit wine
were incased in tule jackets. He hand
ed one of these to the Chicago man.
who said it contained good fiber. At
his request Brown sent for, some of the
full length tule. It was forwarded by
Fred West of Stockton to the manu
facturer.
CALL BUREAU, PRESS BUILD
ING, ST. LOUIS. Nov. 6.â A Chicago
manufacturer ' has made a discovery
that may give a market value to the
tules that cover many thousand acres
of unreclaimable land from the southern
end of San Joaquin to the southern
border of Sutter County in California-
He has found that the tule fiber will
make a good quality of rope and twine
and that paper of commercial value
may be manufactured from its pulp.
He may establish a factory as an ex
periment.
The manufacturer in question entered
the San Joaquin County pavilion in
the Palace of Agriculture last July and
asked Colvin Brown, who is in charge
of the exhibit, if he could tell him
something of the nature of the tule
that he had heard so much about as
growing along the rivers in California.
He wanted to know especially whether
it had any of the qualities of the reed
from which the Egyptian papyrus was
made.

FACTOEY MAY BE BUILT
The leading events in clubdom dur
ir.g the week were the annual meeting
of the local Council of Women at
Golden Gate Hall on Saturday and the
gathering of the clans from the San
Francisco district at Palo Alto on the
tome day, when a host of 150 dele
gates, alternates and friends fore
gatliered In the academic town for
the annual comparing of notes.
There was good fun at that conven
tion at Palo Altoâ fun that grew from
Rood fellowship and a sincerity of
heart end purpose, each visitor con
scious of the earnestness of the other,
tolerant and attentive and not hyper
critical â the latter the besetting sin
of our well meaning but somewhat un
developed sisterhood. And when the
day conies to us that hypercritlclsm
and intolerance are looked upon as
evidences of bad form and 111 breed
ing â the two axe not to-day synon
ymous â then shall we have reached
our highest development â and heaven
hasten the day!
The same general spirit character
ized the deliberations of the Council
of Women, where in generous spirit
action was deferred in regard to the
eiatues of Callfornlans In the Hall of
I'ame at vrashington. And herein lies
a tale.
Some time ago the Pioneer Women
decided to proceed in the matter of
honoring two sons of California by
placing their silent images in Statu
Â¦ ry Hall â which, by the way, is often
regarded as not such an imposing
honor, many preferring the populari
ty of Mrs. Jarley*s wax works, but
that's not the question at issue.
-When the Pioneer Women had their
l.ule scheme in full sail, and had a
circular to the Legislature all ready
lor signatures, along came the Native
daughters with apparently authenti
cated proofs of priority. Then came
the patriotic Daughters of California
Pioneers with a third petition on the
eame subject. And behold, good
friends, the Council of Women being
tempted to take up the already well
appropriated issue, but the temptation
died aborning, and the matter was
laid on the table â and wisely.
Here is a worthy movement, an ac
tion recommended to each State by the
Federal Government. It is a token of
appreciation of public service and an
inspiration of good citizenship to grow
ing children, and therefore is it a vital
Issue. Now, good, contesting friendsâ
J'ioneer Women. Native Daughters. Pio
lieer Daughters and wise Council of
Women â are ye each seeking solely to
Fee California thus honor her sons, and
therein do honor unto herself? If that
l>e your high purpose, ladies, then why
not come together in friendly spirit,
join your forces and your efforts, issue
a Joint petition to the Legislature set
ting forth your desires and ask jointly
lor the appropriation for the statues?
Then will you meet with some meed of
euccess, but should you continue to
Vork along separate lines then you may
count upon failure, for in Legislatures,
as elsewhere in the world, it is the con
certed movement that wins.
Is it not high time that this axiom
were driven home to us Callfornians
and that personal ambitions and preju
dices were submerged in a great public
tnovement?
It is this inability of Californians to
amalgamate that has in times past cost
the State dear. Now, women cf the pe
titioning clubs, let it be your proud
province to set a noble exampleâ the
Â¦waiving of rights, the Joining of hands
and the welding of your strength to
gether. And thus, hand in hand, in
pure patriotic spirit, will the movement
be carried on to success, without which
your efforts will be but as chaff before
the wind. Then here's to a unity of ef
'ort in behalf of the California statues,
tis in all public movements, and let le
diable deal with the obstructionists!

luded to BELOW shown at offices^
"DEAF MUTES"â Several recently made to
hear and SPEAK what' they heard. Numer-
ous witnesses, one being Mr. Butler, well-
known S. F. CHRONICLE representative
"TOTAL DEAFNESS" Rexradio finds . to be
a mere BAGATELLE; nearly every case
"begins" to hear "whispered" words after
3 eeconds* treatment. (Deaf mutes the same.)
"OSSIFIED" LADY, Mrs. Knowles, 379 Bart-
lett by (one) treatment had her locked AN-
CHYLOSED Joints made freely "movable
several weeks ago; no "relapse," but still
further progress to date.
"BLINDNESS" seemed Imminent: within 3
days Rexradio restored good sltht.
"LEAPING" CRIPPLE! paralysis; dragged
foot, limb .nearly "powerless"; 10 seconds'
treatment and I LEAPED before audience."
"LONG DISTANCE" HEARING. My ear' to-
tally deaf from childhood: by 1 treatment
heard (whisper) at 70 feet." . "Â¦' .-
"FEMALE WEAKNESS"â My trouble was
quickly removed' by Rexradio.
"CANCER" disappeared in - one hour after
Rexradio's (one) treatment.
"UP IN THE AIR" In elevator with man
having "crooked" arm (rheumatism). Couldn't
stralKhten it. Rexradio \tas there, too, and
by "moment's" touch straightened it be'ore
descending elevator stopped. Editor of TOWN
TALK was present. Witnessed by me â
WILLIAM ORMSBY.
"BEDRIDDEN" â I saw Rexradio treat man
for years "helpless" in bed, had to be
"lifted" In and out of bed; instantly rose
(unaided) from bed. Other similar cases.
"REXRADIO'P" (one) treatment straightened
my "bent" t limb (rheumatism).
"TYPHOID FEVER" overcome by only 2

"REXRADIO'S" 1 treatment entirely removed
my "dropsy" and straightened limb.
"SUICIDE" avoided: protracted disease ren-
dered life a burden; often thought of sui-
cide, after spending largely, vainly, for re-
lief; then R*xradlo made quick, complete
cure, months ago; no RELAPSE.

REAL ESTATE TKAN'SACTIOXS.
Snakes' eyes are never closed. Sleep
ing or waking, alive or dead, they are
always wide open. This is because
they have no eyelids.
Burke's peerage has no record of tha
title claimed by Moir, nor of any auch
estate.
Having lost his small fortune in Scot
land, it is said Molr left Liverpool early
this year for New York. He visited
a friend in Philadelphia, going thence
to Toronto and later came to Puget
Bound. When his funds ran low he se
cured odd jobs and later became watch
man of a building being erected in
Seattle. Last Wednesday, he says, he
received a cablegram announcing the
death of MacPherson and stating that
a solicitor has left Glasgow with the
details of his good fortune. He will
return to Glasgow with the lawyer.
TACOMA, Nov. 6.â From poverty to
plenty and a seat in the English House
of Lords Is the good fortune befalling
W. D. Moir during the past week, ac
cording to Molr. He says that by the
death of Donald R. MacPherson. who
held the estate but not the title, ha
becomes Lord Corrienony of'Glenmor
rison, Inverness, Scotland, with the
privilege of taking a seat in the House
of Lords. The estates, says Molr, have
a revenue of Â£40,000 sterling yearly.
Molr claims he gets the title through
his mother's family- Her name ' was
Grant.'

The Independents won from the Oak
land Hornets and the Vampires beat
the Pickwicks in the second day's
matches played yesterday for the 1904
1905 championship of the California
Association Football League. The ball
was kicked off at 2:50 p. m. at Free
man's Park, Golden Gate, in the Inde
pendent-Hornet match. The Hornets
were much weakened by the absence
from their eleven of McKenzie. their
captain, who has been suspended for
one month for rough play in the match
of Sunday.- October, 30; of Taylor, their
vice captain. Chamers and Duncan.
The team was weak in combination
and was" beaten J easilv by a score of
f ou r goal s to one.
The first goal was secured after the
ball had been five minutes in play;' but,
though the Independents had several
more shots during the first period, the
score at half time stood: Independents,
one goal ; ' Hornets, nothing.
In the second , half Holland, J. Mc-
Gregor, R. Disher, and Glllchrest ren
dered good service, Â¦ but , the team was
unable to score more Â¦ than one goal,
while the Independents added three
more to their account. The three Fay
brothers and Duncanson played % a
strong game. ";J.D. Robertson' was ref
eree. The match : was marked bv good
feeling â¢ and - an absence of foul play.
day the Vampires will play a practice
game, to which all players are wel
come.
In a swift, clean game the Occiden
tals lowered the colors of . the Albions
at the Ninth and Bryant street grounds
by a score of 3 to 1. It- was neck and
neck in the first half, each side scor
ing a point. In the second half the
Occidentals began with a spurt that
was irresistible. By clever blocking
and clever kicking they landed the ball
between the Albions' goal posts in less
than ten minutes. Allen on the Occi
dentals* forward line picked the leather
from between a pair of the Albions
and - landed it squarely for a score.
Grade, the swift and clear-headed back
of the Occidentals, made the other two
goals. The teams lined up as fol

The Vampires had no difficulty in
beating the Pickwicks on the grounds
at Alameda. Henry Roberta was ref
eree and crave general satisfaction.
Robertson scored one goal for the
Vampires and Peterson made a second
from a penalty kick. The Pickwicks
did not score at all, the Vampire goal
keeper enjoying a sinecure. Had W. T.
Bowcock not kept goal â¢ efficiently for
the Pickwicks the Vampire score would
have been much greater. The winners
scored two goals, the losers nothing.

ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL TEAMS MEET
Both games did not draw a corpor
al's guard. In fact, it was the meas
liest looking bunch of fans that has
shown at the Eighth street lot on a
Sunday afternoon this season. There
was no interest and those who did
drop in came possibly out of curiosi
ty. The only lively feature was a talk
ing match In the first inning for which
Nadeau and Beck were banished to
the bench.
The Brownies started off with two
in the first spasm and might have won
had not Beck and Nadeau waxed too
strong in their argument with Mr.
Brown about Irwin's long hit to left
field which scored Hlldebrand. They
both contended the ball was foul, but
The Brownies in second twice
yesterday when "they hooked up with
the Seals. In the morning, they were
outhlt in a contest of the bats and
finished 11 to 5. In the afternoon
they played baseball that' was a shade
worse than that handed out by the
trailing Seals, the score on that occa
sion beine 5 to 2.

kibroad. If Xeil and Bowker, the Eng
lish champion, are not matched in
this country they have agreed to fight
on' Derby night, June 17, in the Al

Neil told the English referee that
he thought his son should at least
have had a draw. He had a lead in
the first ten rounds, and was strong
at the end of the fight. Â¦?
The referee explained his decision
Ingenuously, saying: "Your boy

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 6. â The close
ness of the league race and the fact
that Tacoma and Los Angeles were
tied with Oakland for the lead at
tracted the greatest crowd to-day that
ever witnessed a ball game in this city.
Approximately 9000 people crowded
the stands and overran the field. The
game was one of the hardest fought
contests of the season and went to Ta
coma by the score of 3 to 2. Overall
and Mason both pitched "great ball and
their support was gilt-edged. Captain
Flood, who was on the bench, saw
fit to protest against Perine's decision
In calling Smith out at first, when to
all appearances he was safe. Perine
ordered the captain off the grounds.
Timely intervention by Manager Mor
ley and some of the players prevented
a possible fight on the diamond be
tween the captain and the umpire.
Doyle's catch of Chance's drive to deep
left center in the eighth saved the
game for Tacoma. It was one of the
best bits of fielding seen here during
the present series. Score:

Both sides did some scoring in the
sixth, Seattle getting two and Oakland
three. Delehanty and I Freeman each
found the ball for one, scoring Delmas
and Van Haltren and tying the score.
Oakland, batted in three. runs in the
last half of the same inning. Francks
hit for two. Schlafiey also drove out
a two-bagger, scoring Francks. Kru
ger made a hit allowing Francks to
score, and a moment later scored him
self on a hit by Streib. Scores:
Seattle â ' Oakland â
Seattle drained the bitter cup of de
feat to the dregs yesterday, being beat
en in both the morning and afternoon
games by the Commuters at Idora
Park. Oakland thus ended the series
with the Northerners with an unbrok
en string of victories and, incidentally,
landed in first place in the race for the
baseball pennant.
The things that Lohman'a buarh did
to Hall, who twirled for Seattle in the
morning game, were almost criminal.
They batted him out of the box and
all over the lot. The slaughter ended
with Oakland six to the good, while
Seattle was forced to swallow a large,
round goose egg. The trouble started
In the v. fourth, when the home team
suddenly fell upon Hall's offerings
without mercy- Before the inning was
over four Commuters had crossed the
rubber.
The Commuters won the afternoon
gnme by bunching their hits at the
right time. They landed one run in the
first, when Dunleavy scored on a wild
pitch, and another came in the third.
Byrnes hit to left for two bags. He
was followed by Schlafley, who sacri
ficed, advancing Byrnes to third. Gan
ley swatted the sphei^i for three sta
tions, allowing Byrnes to score with
ease.

Brown* said fair, and refused to be
moved by the eloquence of the two
tossers. They were sldwly removed
and a corps of pitchers had to be
thrown In to fill the vacancies.
The contest -was a rank one after
that. The Seals Jumped on Thielman
for a run in the third and four more
were enticed over in the fourth. The
Brownies had no more playing spirit
nor courage left and never seemed to
try to score after the initial period.
Gochnauer was hit in the face by
Drennan's grounder in the first inning
and may play no more ball for a week.

Just in time to prevent being sent

Early in the second period Cyril To
bln scored for the reds, followed by
one for the whites made by Driscoll.
This was not allowed, because the
player was eft side. The third period
was barren of results, the playing be
ing so even that neither side could
eccre. During this period Mr. Drtscoll
lost h'.s stick and attempted to recover
it without dismounting. He would have
performed the feat gracefully had not
ene of his epurs touched his pony at a
critical moment, causing the animal to
rear. This threw the rider to the
ground. A scream from the Clark tally

OAKLAND, Nov. 6. â Mrs. Maria
Hayes, 70 years old, was struck at
Seventh and Castro streets at 12:40
o'clock this afternoon by a west bound
Seventh street local train and hurled
twenty feet into the air by the force
of the impact. The aged woman died
two hours later at the Receiving hos
pital. Her death was caused by shock
and injury to her lungs by the pene
tration of ribs which were fractured.
According to Thomas .Worth, a wit
ness,- Mrs. Hayes paid .no attention to
the shrill whistling from the locomo
tive and walked directly in front of
the approaching train. Engineer Bert
Smith' had seen the woman as she
started to cross Seventh street at Cas
tro, and sounded the danger signal.
Supposing that she would heed the
warning he did not ehut off steam
until it was too late. to avoid striking
the woman.* Â¦ -
The injured woman was taken to
the Receiving Hospital. Dr. O. D.
Hamlin was summoned, but after ex
amination he pronounced the patient's
condition hopeless. Mrs. Hayes ex

Rosetti Hicks, a cook employed at
a restaurant on Mission and Twenty
ninth streets, was the victim of a bru
tal assault at the hands of Charles
Jackson, who, with his wife, resides
In the same house with Mrs. Hicks.
The trouble which sent the Hicks
woman to the Emergency Hospital for
treatment for a broken nose and a
fractured skull had its inception over
a new hat that Mrs. Jackson accused
Mrs. Hicks of taking. When Mrs.
Jackson's husband returned to his
home his wife told her side of the
trouble. Jackson at once forced his
way into the room, where Mrs. Hicks
lay in bed and without assigning any
cause for his abrupt entry he seized
her by the feet and pulled her from
her bed to the floor, where he kicked
her head and face.
His blows broke her nose' and frac
tured her skull. She was sent to the
Emergency Hospital by Police Officer
J. A. Ryan, where Dr. Pawlicki dress
ed her nose and placed her in charge
of the matron pending observations.
Jackson was arrested and brought to
the hospital, where he was Identified
by the abused woman. He was sub
sequently booked at the City Hall sta
tion on the charge of an assault with
intent to do irrievous bodily harm.

The party had been visiting with
Dr. and Mrs. Collinge at their home,
1194 Ninth street, during the day, and^
shortly before 6 o'clock they started
to return to San Francisco. They
were accompanied by Dr. and Mrs.
Collinge, Miss Luella and Mr. Percy
Collins and Mrs. Rockel of Oakland
to Encinal Park station. The party
reached the station Just as the train
they had intended to take for San
Francisco pulled out and having miss
ed connections they gathered in a lit
tle crowd and crossed the track be
hind the disappearing train. Just as
they stepped on the other track an
east bound train bore down upon
them, and. before any one except Dr.
Collinge could act the oncoming train
had torn its. way through the little
party, leaving death in its track. Dr.
Collinge alone saw the approaching
train and was. able. to. drag his.daugh-:
ter from her perilous position.
The two trains meet and paes at En
cinal Park station. The -little party
paid little attention to what was hap
pening on the other track and before
they knew it the eastbound train was
upon them. Why the. party ..failed .to
see the oncoming train or why the en
gineer failed to stop when he saw
them on the track are questions that
.will have to be unraveled at the Cor
oner's inquest. When the- train . had
passed Mrs. Esseen and Mrs. Matheson
were dead, Percy Collinge had been
hurled across the street, fortunately
sustaining only a few cuts and. bruises;
Mrs. Collinge had escaped without in-
Jury and Dr. Collinge had drawn his
daughter from the track Just as the
locomotive struck her heel.
The two women who were killed' are
not known in Alameda. Mrs. .Esseen
is a widow, who resided in Los Angeles,
where she has two. children, and Mrs.
Matheson was a spiritualistic medium,'
living at 114 McAllister street, San
Francisco. Dr. Collinge is; a psycholo
gist. The party had been spending the
afternoon at his house. '
As soon as the accident happened Dr.
Collinge went . to San , Francisco to no
tify the family of. Mrs. Matheson and
he had nothing to say except that the
train that caused the. two deaths bore
down upon the little ' crowd without
warning.
Mrs. Collinge , was prostrated ; by, the
shock and Mrs. 'Rockel, who escaped
without injury, said that the whole
thing was" too horrible to ,be described.
The train was - In , charge . of i Conduc
tor E. Fielding and Engineer Dan
Quill. They refused to make any state
ment, buf thev 'will.', claim ,-that: the
passing train; hid the party from ' view
Incidental to the disaster Dr. J. E.
Collinge heroically saved the life of
his daughter, Luella. dragging her
from near the wheels of the locomo
tive.
ALAMEDA. Nov. 6. â A Southern
Pacific train of the narrow gauge
plowed into a party of people at the
corner of Ninth street and Central
avenue to-night and two women were
killed and one young man slightly in
jured. The killed are:
MRS. M. B. ESSEEN of Los An
geles. : -'J ';'<:.
MRS. M. MATHESON of 114 McAl
lister street, San Francisco.'
The young man who .was injured
is Percy Collinge of Alameda.
and that the unfortunate women
walked upon the track directly In
front of the train.
When the train plowed its way
through the little crowd it was run
ning very slowly. Mrs. Esseen and
Mrs. Matheson were in the front of the
party and were struck by the buffer of,
the locomotive. They were thrown i
across the street, their bodies being
crushed and their skulls fractured.' In'
neither case did the wheels of the train i
dismember the bodies. Deputy Coroner I
Fowler took charge of the remains and |
Coroner Mehrmann will make an in- I
vestlgation to-morrow. '

. F.vE. Wertz was very severely in
jured. He suffered a compound frac
ture of the tibia, , besides a smashed
ankle and several deep cuts and
wounds above the leg. He was re
moved to the Park Emergency Hos
pital,, where his bones were set and
his wounds dressed. He ' suffered in
tense pain. Later in the evening he
was removed to the French Hospital.
He said. that when the explosion took
place he was standing on the back
platform. In the panic that followed
he was knocked on* ' the car by r , the
crowd and jumped upon.
Demetreus Ruboekes, after being
treated : at the Park Emergency . Hos
pital,;, was taken" to his home, 925^4
Howard street.
WERTZ'S INJURIES.
Miss Mary Richards, who also lives
at 1101 Adeline street and was with j
Miss^ Davis at the time of the accident,
added that the moment the names
burst out the people in the car seemed '
to go crazy. Pandemonium reigned j
for the time and the crowd Jumped off j
the car right and left. She was hurled
off the car In the excitement, but
escaped without injury.
Misa Delia Davis, who was thrown i
from the car, told the story of the ac- j
cldent as follows:
I was returning from a. trip to the park. I
The car stopped at Hayes street. Suddenly j
there was an explosion on the front part '
of the car, Immediately followed by a burst !
of flames which reached to the roof. I thought '
the car was on fire. A panic ensued and j
those Inside the car stampeded to gtt out. j
In- the general excitement- soma one shoved i
me to thÂ» street; I fell to the ground wlthffl
croat force and people who . followed Jumped'
on me. I fainted and the Aiext thins I knew
I was being: carried by soniÂ« mÂ«i to the side
walk. Later I was removed to the office of
Dr. C. W. Card, who bandaged my foot and
did everything In his power to relieve . my
suffering. I am at present living at 1101
Adeline Street, Oakland. My home Is In
Needles, Cal.. where my father owns a large
farm. I expect It will be a long time before '
I shall be able to walk'. '
MISS, DAVIS' STORY.
Manager George F. Chapman gave
his personal attention to the case. There
was little to explain. The blowing out
of fuses Is not unusual. The fuse is a
safeguard against the dangers of a sud
den addition to the customary voltage
used to operate the line, and when one
blows out its effect is startling, but not
fraught with any danger to crew or
passengers. Had the panic been avert
ed no one would have been Injured.
When the frightened passengers had
recovered their presence of mind Miss
Davis was lying in a faint in the street,
Wertz was groaning and calling for
help as he crawled toward the curb
stone dragging his broken leg after
him, and Ruboekes "was rising to his
feet with a stream of blood dripping
from his wounded arm. He staggered
toward the grocery at the corner, where
he fell. He was picked up by bystand
ers and hurried to the office of Dr. C.
W. Card, at 502 Devisadero street. Dr.
Card took several stitches in the cut
before he could stop the flow of blood.
Miss Davis was also brought into Dr.
Card's office, where she received care
ful attention from both the doctor and
his wife. Wertz was sent to the Park
Hospital, where his injuries were treat
ed by Dr. Stevens. He was afterward
removed to the French Hospital. The
injured man is a chef at the Palace
Hotel.
In an instant there was a struggle in
the interior of the car as men and
women attempted to crush toward the
doors. Ruboekes attempted to get
through a window and punctured his
arm with a sharp piece of glass. Wertz
Jumped from the step of the car and
fifteen or twenty frantic men and wom
en fell on top of him, kicking and
struggling to clear themselves of what
all seemed to believe would be a second
explosion. Car windows were smashed
and pieces of glass were scattered all
over the street.
RESUI/T OF PAXTC.
Before the car reached the turn at
Devisadero street many of the pas
sengers got off, but there were still
about sixty on board. In accordance
with the rules of the United Railroads
a stop was made at Hayes street be
fore crossing the tracks of the cable
road. The blowing out of the fuse oc
curred when the motorman turned his
controller after getting the signal to
go ahead from the conductor. The car
had not started to move when the flash
and sharp report as If of an explosion
caused a panic among the passengers.
The glare of the fuse and the sound
of breaking glass were terrifyinjr but
not necessarily dangerous. Had the
passengers kept their seats no harm
could have come to them, but several
women who were sitting on the for
ward part of the dummy, among whom
were Miss Delia Davis and her com
panion, Miss Mary Richards, lost their
heads, screamed and made a jump for
the street.
STOPS AT CROSSING.
It was car No. 704, one of the old
Folsom street cars, transferred to the
Ellis street division on account of the
heavy Sunday traffic, that came to
grief. The big crowd from the nark
filled the car at the western terminus
of the line and it started eastward with
as many people aboard as could be ac
commodated. The motorman and con
ductor were powerless to prevent the
overcrowding. Remonstrance would
be useless with such a homeward
bound crush of passengers as that
which gathered at the park entrance
awaiting transportation toward the
city.
Four persons were Injured In a panic
that followed the blowing out of a fuse
on one of the electric cars of the Devi
sadero and Ellis streets line at Devisa
dero and Hayes streets yesterday after
noon at about 6:45 o'clock. Two of the
injured ones w^fe severely hurt and
two were slightly bruised.
Demetreus Ruboekes received a deeD
cut in the left, arm that severed an
artery and caused him nearly to, bleed
to death. F. E. Wertz of 504 Stockton
street suffered a compound fracture of
the right leg. Miss Delia Davis of 1101
Adeline street, Oakland, was slightly
bruised about the body and her ankle
was sprained. An unknown man was*
cut slightly about the hands by broken
glass, but he left the scene of the ac
cident without reporting to any of the
railroadmen. . >a.V

A performance of "The County
Chairman" will be given at the Colum
bia Theater to-night for the benefit of
the Girls' Club. It is expected that
the affair will be largely attended. The
patronesses are: Mrs. Leon Sloss, Mrs.
Paola de Vecchi, Mrs. I. W. Hellman
Jr., Mrs. A. Stern, Mrs. Eugene C.
Gallois. Mrs. Charles Durbrow and
Mrs. W. Lllienthal. These ladies have
worked hard to make the affair a suc
cess.
Benefit for Girls' Club.
"Sweet Clover" was played at the
California Theater last night, with Otis
B. Thayer as Jerome Holcombe and
Miss Gertrude Bondhill as L/ois Hol
combe. It is a strong play, with ten
der sentiment and broad, old-fash
ioned humor running close together.
Otis Thayer's role is a natural old
man of the rugged Yankee type, and
Miss Bondhill is first the charming
ingenue and afterward the woman,
strong In adherence to her wifely
vows. John Maurice. Sullivan made an
excellent Edredge Grosvenor and Clara
Tapsfleld was good in her role of
Abigail Holcombe. "Sweet Clover"
will continue this week.
"Pretty Peggy" entered upon Its sec
ond and last week at the Grand Opera
house last night before a crowded
house. The play was well received by
those present. Miss Jane Corcoran,
who appeared in the title role, was
warmly welcomed and scored a great
hit by the clever way in which she por
trayed the traits of the great actress.
One of the best bills offered by the
Orpheum in months opened yesterday
afternoon and will continue through
| out the week. Every number received
. deserved applause. John T. Kelly and
company are foremost in amusement.
Kelly holds the center of the stage
and his work is that of a first-class
comedian. He has a much better op
portunity than when he appeared last
in this city with the Weber & Fields
â¢ combinations and .he takes advantage
j of every trick. He appears in an
! original sketch, "Senator McPhee,"
and is assisted by Florence Veldran,
j Hermann Lieb and Louis G. Christy.
Twelve young ladies appear in a
1 musical act, "The Navajo Girls." The
1 novelty comprises instrumental solos,
j vocal solos and dancing. All are ex
Â¦ cellent musicians. Reed and Shaw do
. marvelous muscular work. Both are
j strong men of a high order and intro
duce many new features in their line.
Wee Jeanle Fletcher appears as. the
i "Scottish nightingale." Her ballads
are heartily applauded and her voice is
. good.
Canfleld and Carlton furnish an
' abundance of fun in their original
absurdity, "The Hoodoo," and Wat
son, Hutchlngs, Edwards and com
pany present "The Vaudeville Ex
; change." The scheme of the act is
' complete and the combination pleases.
: Halley and Meehan open the pro
' gramme as blackface comedians with
many new specialties. Their songs and
' witticisms win them favor and they
work well , together. Owing to the
length of the programme the biograph
pictures were cut out, but the show
J is worth seeing and is sure to enjoy a
large patronage.
Gio\annoni was induced to take a
few drinks and one of the trio stole
the sack containing the $450 from his
pocket. Giovannoni protested and he
was handed a J!0 Confederate bill and
told to get out. He reported the case
to the police.
It is thought that De Graccia had
left the city. When searched a card
of a hotel at Bakersfield was found in
his pockets, also $6i> worth of Confed
erate bill?- Ryan and Taylor believe
that De Grarcia was one of four men
Â¦who swindled Giovanni Rossi out of
$200 during a card game near a ceme
tery on October 31. Rossi was induced
to go with them, as they offered to sell
him a vegetable garden. They got him
Into a saloon and introduced him to the
card game. Rossi will be asked to
have a look at De Graccia-
Ever since December 14 last Ryan
and Taylor have been searching for De
Graccia, who is said to be a clever
bur.ko mar- On that day it is alleged
he met Giovannoni on Broadway and
told him he knew of a vegetable garden
Xor sale. Giovannoni procured 5450 in
gold which he put in a sack and ac
companied De Graccia to the Mission
r-^ad. They went into a saloon and
were joined by two other Italians who
wtre introduced to Giovannoni as the
owners of the parden.
