to her her true condition. Of course,
you have no discretion in the matter.
|f she should present herself before
you can speak to her and if you think
she does so in ignorance, then you
can speak to her afterward. There is
no. reason in this case to make - any

FIERCE STORM SWEEPS FROM
ROCKIES TO THE LAKES.
Vast Area Suffers Great Dam
age From the. Blizzard.
Cyclonic Wind in Chicago.
~\\Â£ire and Train
â¢ 'Almost Paralyzed.
-CHICAGO, Dec. 27. â One of -the se
verest storms of recent years, has raged
throughout the territory lying between
the Rocky Mountains and "the Great
Lakes since early this morning and has
caused much^ trouble to street cars,
railroads and telegraph companies. The
telegraph .companies were the greatest
sufferers from the blizzard, which has
swept -through the West and North
west during the last twenty-four hours
and which was preceded by a heavy
fog and drizzlingrairi: which made the
wires' almost unworkable. The intense
cold and i terrific gale . that followed
close --upon the fog coated, the wires
with ice and later in the day threw
poles to the ground, crippling the com
panies badly. Railroad trains were
bafily delayed all through the West,
some of them being twenty- four hours
late. Street-car traffic in all the cities
of the West and Northwest was prac
tically at a standstill at some time dur
ing the- day;
COVERS A WIDE AREA.
"In its extent the storm was the most
widespread of any' during the last fif
teen years. Counting the fog as a com
ponent part of the storm, it stretched
from the Rocky Mountains to New York
and from ,Winnipeg -to New Orleans.
The only fatalities due to the storm in
this city were:
Alexander Stelner, a teamster, killed
while unloading coal. A chute Was
blown from its fastenings, and, strik
ing Steiner on the head, killed him in
stantly.
Thomas Walsh, a laborer, . struck by
a heavy board while entering a new
building on Green street and Washing
ton bouievard. The board almost cut
his head off.
At 10 o'clock to-night the storm was
reported as subsiding at Kansas City
and other points in a north and south
line from that city, but it will be sev
eral days before normal conditions are
restored throughout the entire section.
CENTER NEAR CHICAGO.
At Chicago and east of here the storm
was still raging at midnight with
great violence. The center of . the
storm is between Chicago and Cleve
land. - -'
Reports from Kansas City early In
the day were that the storm extended
from the middle of Missouri as far
south as Indian Territory. It was ac
companied throughout Its entire extent
by heavy winds and snow.' The snow

the .cities of. Nebraska, Kansas and
Western Missouri street car traffic was
at a standstill by noon.
', The storm by noori had reached East
ern Missouri and â¢ the temperature in
St. Louis went down twenty degrees in
two hours, while the wind, â¢ blowing
forty miles an hour, piled the snow up
in the streets in great drifts. It was
found possible to keep the street cars
running, although great havoc was
wrought with the telegraph and tele
phone wires.
. RAGES IX NORTHAVEST.
At Omaha and Des Moines conditions
similar to those in Kansas City were
reported and both places were in bad
shape early in the day.
. All over the Western States the storm
increased in violence throughout . the
morning and at noon. was raging with
great fury. All trains in this section
were reported from one.toÂ«Bix hours
late, arid constantly losing. time. .
In the Northwest the storm was even
more violent than throughout Missouri
and Iowa. In St. Paul the snow com
menced falling early last night and
grew heavier all through the night,
while the wind increased until it was
blowing at fifty miles an hour. The
storm traveled westward from St. Paul
until It covered almost; the entire
Northwest. â¢â
From the Dakotas, Eastern Montana,
Wyoming, Northern Michigan and Wis
consin came stortes of damage by the
storm. The wires in all directions were
down, Â« the snow filled the streets and
street cars were for the most part com
pelled to stop. running and all trains
were far behind time.
HEAVY WINDS IN SOUTH.
In the South conditions were some
what better, the enow In many places
being changed into a heavy rainfall,
preceded by thunder and lightning and
followed by heavy winds. Nashville,
Louisville, New Orleans, Montgomery
and' Memphis, reported exceedingly
heavy rains, a rapidly falling ther
mometer and terrific winds.
In the Ohio River Vajley the first
heavy rain in. five months commenced
falling early in the day and continued
throughout the night. The storm was
appreciated by the Doatmen along the
Ohio and its tributaries, for the stage
of water in those streams has of late
been very low and navigation was dif
ficult In many places. â¢ -

PORTLAND, Dec. 27.â The Federal
Grand /Jury to-day returned seven in
dictments in connection with the land
fraud^cases now under investigation.
The j large number In the batch and
tlie prominence of three of. the num
ber, with the two mysterious. "John
Doe" indictments, made, the day the
most sensational since the jury recon
vened in its present sessions. The most
Important is the indictment against Dr.
William H. Davis, Mayor of Albany,
Or. Second to this and of hardly less
Importance are those of Salmon^ P.
Ormsby, formerly a Government agent,
and , Clark E. Loomis," at one time
Forest Superintendent. Henry.. A.
Young and George Sorenson are not
so well known. The indictment states
that there are two others, John Doe
and Richard Roe, implicated, whose
true names the jury does not know.
In the indictment Just returned Wil
liam H. Davis, 'Mayor pf Albanv and
chairman of the Republican County
Central Committee of Linn County, is
the central figure. The Government
will attempt to prove by the evidence
against the Albany man that he went
into the alleged conspiracy to defraud
the Government knowingly and a year
after he had abandoned him claim as
the result of an- alleged correspondence
with the Land Office at -Washington.
In 1901 C. E. Loomis came to Albany
to, make a report on the claim of Davis,
and about forty-five other claims held
up by the department. The. Govern
ment asserts, that Davis, became un
easy about this time and wrote to Bin
ger Hermann, then commissioner of
the General Land Office asking his ad
.ylce. in regard to his filing. He also
asked Loomis, according to the Gov
ernment, to write to the departmenfin
regard to his claim. Under date of
March 11, 1901, it is alleged, Loomis
wrote a personal letter to Hermann
| asking his advice in relation to the
claim. The letter closed, so the Gov
ernment asserts, with the statement
that Loomis would be glad to gain any
information which might be of use to
"some very good friends" of Hermann's
in, Lynn County.
; f United States Senator John H. Mit
chell has not as yet been allowed to
appear before the Federal Grand Jury
to, hear what charges it is alleged have
been, or will be. brought against him.
'This morning he appeared at the door

FRANKLIN'S
ARREST IS
DEMANDED
Mrs. Charles E. Nelson De
clares Her Sister's Life
Was Frequently Threaten
ed by Traveling Companion
NO DOUBT OF; DEAD
WOMAN'S IDENTITY
Relatives Are Convinced
That'the .Victim of the
Cutler Mountain Murder
Was Mrs; Bessie Bouton
Escclal Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, Dec. 27.â After
having been shown a detailed descrip
tion of the woman murdered on Cutler
Mountain In Colorado, Mrs. Charles
Nelson, the sister of Mrs. Bessie Bou
ton, said to-day that there was no
room to doubt that Mrs. bouton was
the victim. Mrs. Nelson reiterated her
statement that,' in her opinion, Milton
Franklin, who visited this coast under
the name of George Bouton with the
girl, should be arrested. \, Franklin is
a gambler. Mrs. Nelson alleges that
he threatened the life- of Mrs. Bouton
on" several occasions.
Mrs. Nelson Is anxious to go to Colo
rado Springs to identify the body, but
claims that she has not sufficient
means to do so. She has telegraphed
to the chief of police of that city that
if he will forward her a ticket she will
leave at once.
Last August Mrs. Bessie Bouton, ac
companied by â¢ a man claiming to be
Milton Franklin, came here from Den
ver for a visit with the Nelsons. Mrs.
Bouton Informed her sister that she
and Franklin were engaged to be mar
ried, although no date had been set
for the ceremony. 'Franklin's health
was poor and he claimed to be travel
ins for its benefit and taking a rest
from his regular occupation of a trav
elins salesman. Those who met him
during his stay here remember that
he was a very excitable and Irascible
man, and that he always carried a
couple of revolvers. It is said that be
fore he had been here long it became
apparent that he was a professional
gambler.
CLEARING THE MYSTERY.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Dec.
27. â The theory that the woman mur
dered on Cutler. Mountain, near this
city, was Mrs. Bessie Kempter Bouton,
formerly of Syracuse, N. Y., Is still
regarded by the police here as the
strongest yet advanced. The Butte,
Mont., clew that the woman may have
been Mrs. W. J. Bodno of that place
Is discredited by the statement that
Mrs. Bodno had had her dental work
done very, recently, , The dental, .work
in the mouth of the dead woman
showed considerable wear, this fact
being regarded Â« by -the dental experts
who have examined, the work as Indi
cating that the dead woman yras not
younger than 25 years of age.
The police to-day have been inter
viewing the local i drug-store proprie
tors and hair dressers and have found
abundant evidence that Mrs. Bouton
was in this city for several days about
October 1, and that during her stay
here she was In the capacity of a rep
resentative of Dr. J. A. Parker Pray,
manufacturing chemist, of 12 East
Twenty-third street. New Tone
There is not a circumstance yet
brought to light, however, that gives a
clew to where Mrs. Bouton went, if
anywhere, from this city.
The mystery surrounding the mur
der is believed here to be yielding to
the/ efforts of the officers, who believe
that they are now on the right track.
HUSBAND BEARS GOOD NAME.
SYRACUSE. N. Y., Dec 27.â Mrs. C.
H. Kempter, mother of Mrs. Bessie
Bouton, ' is thoroughly convinced that
the victim of the Cutler Hill murder is
her daughter. The last letter she-re
ceived from the girl was written at the
Albany Hotel, Denver. â¢ She would not
disclose the contents. She said the
â¢rlrl's name was Doske, but that she
was known as Bessie. The woman's
husband lives here. He is a mechanic
of good reputation. The couple lived
together only: a short time, and he has

BY SAIXY SHARP.
'TIs omcially decided â 10 o"clock's
ihe correct hour to put in appearance
at a ball. Ten. remember â dinner or
no dinner. That's not the question.
That was the hour most of the
smart maids and matrons of the As
sembly stepped from their carriages
last nitfht into the warmth of the
Pa!acÂ« court.
At half after the ball was in full
sway.
Loads of nice men 'were available
early, and "all was gay as a marriage
bell" â all save the vulnerable collars
of the dancing: men, which, alas', and
alack! behaved 6hockingly. But most
of the men of forethought had a re
lay of linen in their top coats' cav
erns. This saved the honor of thÂ»
hour, and the men were not ouu
ehone by the maids in sweet and crisp
attire. And such are the rewards ot
forethought!
The ballroom ttcls fair to look upon
last night, with its pungent pines and
firs standing sentinels at every pillar.
The music came from a latticed
bower, palm-hidden, and was alluring
enough to tempt the chaperones to tap
their dear little toes on the maple.

Eleanor Martin, Mrs. W". A. McKit

much regretted, though Mrs. Coolidge
graciously consented to assist in Mrs.
Voorhies' absence.

LONDON SUBWAY

Pierpont Morgan to Make
-Another Attempt to Put
l^is Plans Into Effect
Special Dlsnatch to Ths CalL
LONDON, Dec, 27.â J; Pierpont Mor
gan's sixteen-mile' electric underground
railway scheme, which is to connect
London' with the counties of Essex and
Herts, is not , going . to be abandoned,
as it was supposed. Parliamentary
notices will be served at the beginning
of the new year and Parliament, when
It meets in February, will be asked to
grant the necessary powers to construct
the proposed line.
The scheme will meet with thÂ» most
determined opposition from existing
railway companies whose train service
touches the particular districts which
the new "tube" â as they always call
such railways here â would cover, but
as most of the region is inhabited by
the working classes it la believed that
the government will agree that such a
railway is a public necessity.
The promoters of the scheme fear
the opposition of the London County
Council most. This' body, which gov
erns-municipal London, proposes to
construct a system of electric street
car lines through the same region, and
it does not want Morgan's competi
tion. But the views of the different
public men in the districts affec.ted
have been canvassed by the ' Morgan
people, who claim to have indications
that the "tube" would be welcomed.
All the material collected in this way
â¢ will be r>laced before the Parliamen
tary committee,, with which rests the
fate of the scheme. . . -
The r>!an was thrown out before
chiefly on the ground that it was over
capitalized, the capital is to be re
duced this time to' $35,000,000. There- is
a rumor that Sir Thomas Lipton is in
terested in the deal, but this cannot
be confirmed.

Sign, of Interference in
'the Senatorial Contest
Governor George C.Pardee came in
from Sacramento last evening and will
leave the city tn-day for San JosÂ« to
attend the educational convention.
Frank P. Flint of Los Angeles, on* of
the leading candidates for . United
States Senator, arrived from the south
yesterday and will remain here to ex
change views with statesmen and oth
ers, until next Saturday or Sunday,
when he will leave for Sacramento.
Leo Youngwood and Dr. Balch are with
Mr. Flint, ji Eight or ten progressive
citizens of the southland will arrive in
San Francisco to-morrow* and proceed
immediately to the agreeable duty of
sounding. 'the praises of the Los Ange
les aspirant for Senatorial honors.
AH signs point to a remarkably act
ive campaign in Sacramento in behalf
of. Mr. Flint. The aspirant himself
seems confident of success. When asked
last evening for an estimate of his
strength he replied:
I expect forty-six votes on tht first ballot.
Independent of , any support from the organ
ization. If tha strength of ihe organization
torr.es to me on the tint ballot I will be
elected, i If It goes to scm$ other candidate
the, contest will be prolonged.'
*In the Bard camp there seems to be
growing, confidence that the Senator
will be re-elected. The claim is ad
vanced, that Bard will get at least for-*
.ty-two votes on the first ballot. E. O.
Gerberding, who is paying attention teÂ»
the political interests of Senator Bard,
Will be here to-morrow. . There Is an
impression that the Senator will be In
.Sacramento early next week, but at
last accounts Mr. Gerberding had not
.received, definite . information on this
point.
Estimates as to the strength of^Henry
T. Oxhard and George A. Knight vary.
There Is gossip to the effect that'Ox
nard'wlH get twenty "votes at the out
set.. It is said that George Knight will
register a >oting strength of at least
eight on the first ballot. Politicians
would not be surprised if the figure
reached fourteen.
I " The .sentiment is widespread In Re-
I publican, camps that the Senatorship
I belongs to the south,. not on geograph

party politics. The stalvrart adhesion
ot southern Republicans to the party

marked .that the other United States!
Senator; George C. Perkins, the Cabi- j

Governor, Secretary of State, Con

Northern-" California, hence it .Is faic j
and just^lllat "Senator Bard's succless'or j

Congress, and from the Governor of the
State and other Republican " leaders.
i TheS6Uthern Pacific's political bureau

communicating with the ship.
Hidden in a black fog and pounded
by fierce seas rolling from the south
east, the steamship to-night was in im

her captain and crew of thirty-two men
are still on the ship, they face almost
certain death in the heavy surf break

The captain would not let the life
savers take off his crew yesterday
when the seas were not running so
high and to-day it was too late to help
them. No lifeboat in the world could
be launched in the teeth of the gale
that was blowing up ana down the

The fog was so thick that the strand

sent to the vessel last night, but as no
report was received from 'them to-day
it is thought they may hare left her

1016 Broadway. Dec 27.
â¢ Mrs. Emily Tyson of Niles, who
charges "Doctor" William S. Proctor
with swindling her, after Inducing her
to promise to marry him, says that not
only did Proctor ask her to become his
wife, but even made plans for the wed
ding. Mr*. Tyson said that after an
acquaintance of but one day the de
fendant broached the subject of, mar
riage, and she said, "Yes." L-it*r she
â  discovered that she had been the vic
tim of a schemer.
Mrs. Tyson told her Btory at the pre
liminary examination of Proctor and
his stepson, Roy Asberry, which be
gan at Centerville to-day.
Mrs. Tyson said she was 11 years of
age. She first met Proctor on Decem
ber 16. On the following day he called
at her house and sold her a pair of
eyeglasses. Mrs. Tyson said:
Proctor made overtures of marriage. I told
him I would not marry unless he had mocsy
enough to take care of me and that I would
not marry any man who was not a gentle
man. Proctor said he neither drank, smoked
nor swore, and told me he wanted to marry
â¢ome one he could love. He bad been a
widower for fifteen years and was 69 years old.
He called again and said I was just the woman
he had been looking for. At 5 o'clock Sunday
evening he called again, aocompasltd by As
berry, who passed as a eon. He tent the
voung man back to Nlles with the buggy and
came Into the house and began to talk of
marriage.
He held my hand and told me he had fallen
In love with me at first sight and I consented
Later be told me that his borne In Oakland
was not quite ready to live la, and said that
he wished to purchase another place. He said
he had $550 In the bank, but needed Just $108
more to make the purchase.
The witness said that before the
"doctor" left she introduced him to
her son. -to Mrs. Goforth and to Miss
Emellne Tyson, her granddaughter.
Continuing, the old lady said:
Proctor told xae he wished to rive r=e an
engagement ring and wanted to get the siza
of my finger, so I got my Jewelry box and
laid several rings out on the bed.
The "doctor" took two of them and put one
on his finger. He held the other In his hand
and said be would return them on the fol
lowing Thursday. Before I could protest he
jumped Into bis buggy and drove away. The
next - time I saw the rings was after Proctor
and Asberry had been arrested. â  The arrest
was made by my toes. David. Benjamin and
Henry.
At the conclusion of Mrs. . Tyson's
story Judge Sandholdt continued the
preliminary examination until Thurs
day, December 29.
Since the arrest of Proctor- and As
berry Judge Sandholdt has received
several letters from people in differ
ent, parts of the State, all of .which
give Proctor an unsavory reputation.
One of these letters is signed by Alex
ander. Beck, the Watsonville repre
sentative of the New York Life Insur
ance Company. Beck says Proctor is
sued a fraudulent policy for $3000 to
a widow and kept half the commis
sion. He say the San Francisco of

Proposition to Furnish
Oakland New Water Supply
SATISFACTORY SHOWING
City Council Will Take Up
Matter Thursday at Its
Regular Weekly Meeting
OAKL_\NT>, Dec 27.â The Bay Cities
Water Company's proposition to fur
nish a municipal water supply to the
i city of Oakland has been reported upon
favorably by the Board of Engineers
appointed to examine the project on be
half of the city and the company. That
board, which is composed of City Engi
neer F. C, Turner, A. M. Hunt and J.
M. Howells, filed Ita report to-night
with the City Council.
According to the report, which is
unanimous, the board finds that the
water sheds are ample to furnish the
required 20,000,000 gallons of water
daily, that the water will be satisfac
tory in quality, and, the engineering
features are easily overcome.
With the report were filed plans and
specifications of dams, reservoirs, pipe
lines, etc., which will be considered
with the report in committee . of the
whole at Thursday night* s meeting. At
the same time the following resolution,
introduced by Councilman McAdam,
wlll^be discussed:
Resolved. That the Contra. Costa "Water
Company be and It is hereby requested to fur
nish to this Council a valuation of Its plant
for the purpose of presenting the same to the
voters of the city of Oakland for thÂ«lr accept
ance or rejection; provided that the same shall
not be submitted if the valuation of the plant
of eald company shall be deemed excessive by
this Council
McAdam said he had been requested
'by residents of the First "Ward and
other persons to introduce the resolu
tion.
The engineer's report recites that the
board visited the water sheds, tunnel
site, dam sites, reservoir sites and fol
lowed the pipe line from the intake to
the open country through the Arroyo
Valle nearly to Pleasanton. The engi
neers found, they say, elaborate and
most excellent records of stream flow
and' rainfall, which have been made for
two years in the Mount Hamilton
region by the Bay Cities "Water Com
pany. All this, together with maps,
drawings, calculations and other data
have been placed at the board's dis
posal. Public records were used, and
many engineering reports that had
bearing upon this region or upon the
questions Involved were carefully read
and considered.

hardly less important are the guaran

Gillett Takes Prominent Part in Swayne
Case and Bard Stands Against
Uniting Territories.
â  CAUL. BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON. Dec 27.â Nathaniel C.
Ray of Mariposa. County has spent a
toqd deal of time and energy in Wash
ington in the interest of the bill chang
ing from the Jurisdiction of "icsemite
Park to that of the Sierra. Forest Re
serve that large section wherein are
contained private holdings, including a
great number of valuable mines. Sen
ator Perkins took advantage of an op
portune moment the other day to se
cure its passage by the Senate .and
since then it passed the House. Ray
iays a hundred mines now idle will be
at work at once and other industries
dependent upon them revived. The
great expense and inconvenience at
tendent upon the operation of the mines
under the restrictions that apply to a
national park have caused them to shut
.4own. As a part of a forest reserve,
toads may be built, electric power de
veloped from the streams and the mines
made profitable.
Representative Gillett of California
was the principal champion of Judge
Swayne, whose impeachment will be
one of the notable incidents of the his
tory of the Fifty-eighth Congress. He
was one of the special committee that
â went to Florida, the Judge's bailiwick,
and heard the story at first hand upon
which the charges were framed. Gil
lttt championed the Judge against all
the original charges of discrimination
aJid persecution in the administration
of hiE office, and in the minority re
port of the committee which he wrote
*t.t the close of the hearing last session
he -argued in the Judge's behalf. But
'then came testimony taken during the
iecess upon a charge upon which little
stress was laid beforeâ that of falsify
ing his expense accounts.
The Judge had presented claims for
expenses in traveling over his circuit in
the uniform sum of $10 a day. These he
had sworn to. Witnesses testified as
to the rates at the hotels at which he
had stopped, and the railroad rates.
The Judge, though given an opportun
ity, made no effort to explain the dis
crt'p.ancy.
â¢This left us not one thing to do."
said Gillett. "There was the law that
made it a crime to so filch from the
Gdrtminent. I don't think there was a
man, toward the last, on the commit
tee, that desired to impeach him on the
other charges. *but this little detail of a
false oathâ that was different. They
say It is the custom for Judges to make
the uniform fate of JlO.a day for ex
penses. If so they are simply violating
the law. But this was the one case
before us and we did the only thing
inhere was to do."
The trial will take place before the
Senate after the recess.
A. . H. Hebtx, president of the Im

As a result of the fight occupying all

offer 'of $2,000,000, and this, after
stime delay, was accepted. The Gov

the plan being to incorporate it in the

exhaustive inquiry and examination is
being made, until the conclusion of

this matter â that there will be no
split, no admission of one and ex
clusion of the other. The East stands
against admitting any more States shy
on population.
Senator Bard, however, presents a
strong and peculiar circumstance In
his argument- In the act creating the
Territory of Arizona the provision
contained in every other such act,
from the time of Wisconsin, reserving
to Congress the right to attach "any
portion of said territory to any other
State or Territory," is conspicuously
absent. Such provision is contained
in the acts creating the Territories of
Wisconsin, Oregon, Minnesota, Utah,
New Mexico, Washington, Kansas,
Colorado and Dakota.
The Arizona act provides that Con
gress may divide or change its boun
daries, but nothing is said of the right
to attach to it any other State or Terri
tory. On the contrary, it distinctly
says that the Government then created
shall continue until such time as the
people residing therein "shall, with con
sent of Congress, form a State gov
ernment and apply for and obtain ad
mission into the Union as a State on
I an equal footing with the original
States." This time, says Senator Bard,
has not come. The people have not
applied for admission on the terms
presented. This fact should in this
country stand against all other argu
ments, he says. The people are not
passively assenting; they are act
! ively and energetically protesting.
The bill Just introduced by Senator
J Kearns of Utah that would cut off
from fVrizona all that portion lying
north of the Colorado and attach it to
Utah is in response to a resolution of
the Legislature of that State framed as
long ago as February, 1S93. The me
morial sets forth that the region re
ferred to is inaccessible to the south
ern and more populous portion of Ari
zona, and is, therefore, a rendezvous
for criminals from Utah, it being very
difficult to administer the law there.
To get extradition papers a journey
south to Los Angeles and thence to
Phoenix, then a return by the same
long route, is necessary. The tax col
lector is set at defiance, too. The flocks
and herds that graze over the land â
the onlv use to which it Is put â are
made to cross the line when the man
from Arizona is after the revenue they
should yield the Government; but let
the collector from Utah trv to . come
xiown upon them and they are back
in Arizona. However, the bill and
this plausible reasoning behind it will
hardly divert the course of the state
hood bill at this late day.

CARRIES FIGHT
TO THE ENEMY
Board of Works Wants Grand
Jury to Investigate Super
visors as to Paving Bills
PHASE OF OLD FIGHT
Send Communication to Fore
man T. P. Andrews â Bran
denstein Eager for Inquiry
The friction between the Board of
Public Works and the Board c-f Super
visors is to be aired before the Grand
Jury. The Commissioners want an in
vestigation of charges they prefer that
the Supervisors in their animus and
political machinations to discredit the
Schmitz administration are placing ob
stacles in the way of the Department of
Public Works in a highly, unwarranted
manner and seriously- subverting public
welfare. The Supervisors declare that
an investigation would be welcomed
and assert that they will have enough
complaints to offer against the Public
Works Commissioners to tax the zeal
of the mc-st energetic grand juror. The
fur is expected to fly. .
The Public Works Commissioners
yesterday sent a communication to
Foreman Andrews asking mat he di
rect the attention of the inquisitorial
body to the conduct of the Supervisors
particularly in reference to the street
department. It is set fortii that in the
annual budget the niggardly sum of
$40,000 was set apart fur the repair of
pavements during the year, and it is
alleged that the purpose of the Super
visors was to handicap the present ad
ministration and place it in bad odor
with people who are interested in hav
ing pood thoroughfares.
Again, the action of the Supervisors
in blocking payment of the bills of F.
M. Yorke & Co.. which has the con
tract for repair of pavements. Is
deemed a proper subject ro-r the Grand
Jury probe. The communication recites
that Yorke's bills for work are reason
able and the rates no higher than those
that have obtained for several years.
The care of the public thoroughfares as
a result has been hampered to an ex
asperating degree, and it is pleaded
that a halt should be called on the
board that is grossly abusing its func
tions in refusing to allow a proper ad
ministration of the streets.
The typewritten document from the
Commissioners states plainly that the
Supervisors are actuated by the un
worthy motives of the scheming politi
cian. It is contended that they are
manipulating their powers of supervis
ing the expenditure of the public
moneys so as to make it appear that
the Board of Public Works is unworthy
of its trust They are charged with a
purpose of preventing the repair of
streets that It may appear that the
Schmitz regime 1 has failed in its duty
and gives the public the poorest of
service. In short, the Supervisors are
accused of doing "cheap politics." with
a view to accomplish the downfall of
Schmitz and his administration.
When Foreman Andrews received the
communication he sent for Supervisor
Brandensteln, and a conference of half
an hour \tfas lie'ia in: the Grand Jury
rooms in the Mills building. Branden
stein was -not disposed to discourage
the idea of an investigation. He an
nounced that he would be pleased to
have a go with the Public Works offi
cials before the Grand Jury. Then he
quoted from Shakespeare and in dra
matic fashion deciaimed, "Lay on,
MacDuff; and damned be him who
first cries, hold, enough."
TO SELL PART
OF BOND ISSUE
Board Invites Proposals on
March 6. 1905, to Carry Out
Most Urgent Improvements
The Beard of Supervisors yesterday
passed to print an ordinance inviting
proposals on March 6, 1S05, for the pur
chase of $2,573,800 of the municipal
bond issue for public Improvements still
remaining unsold. The portion to be
sold includes hospital bonds, $250,000;
sewer bonds, $724,800; school bonds, $1,
077,600; street improvement bonds, $243,
000; County Jail and Hall of Justice
extension bonds, $278,400.
It . is proposed to have the Board of
Public Works pass resolutions of inten
tion for. the .most urgent street and
sewer work. | It will be necessary to
purchase some land for the carrying
out of the school, jail and Hall of Jus
tice improvements.
An offer was. made by F. M. Burge on
behalf of ah Eastern concern to pur
chase the entire bond issue remaining
unsold. Burge produced a letter from
W. Mason, treasurer and manager of
the Beaver Creek Coal Company of
Philadelphia, stating he was authorized
to bid par or face value on the issue of
$17,000,000. The finance committee was
much impressed with the confidence
shown in the bonds by Eastern parties
and thought.it should encourage . local
financiers to Aid. While Burge's offer
was not formally accepted he was
urged to put In a bid for the issue of
$2,573,800 proposed to be sold on March
6, 1905. '
Preliminary steps were taken by the
finance committee which will ulti
mately result in the widening of Mis
sion street, from Tenth street to the
bay, and also its sewering from Second
street to the bay.
Herbert E. Law informed the com
mittee that the property owners on the
street were ready. to purchase sufficient
bonds on condition that assurance be
Klven that the improvement 'will be
carried out. The bonds to be sold for
the purpose aggregate $200,000, of which
$125,000 is for the sewer and $75,000 for
widening and repaving. The commit
tee regarded the . Improvement as nec
essary and agreed to order It done In
the event that bonds in the amount
named are bought.

CEMETERY LAW
BEING TESTED
Demurrer to the Complaint
Against Laurel Hill Ar
gued Before Judge Hunt
Defendant's demurrer to the com
plaint in the suit of Bessie Hume vs.
Laurel Hill Cemetery and the Mayor,
Supervisors and Board of Health of
San Francisct was argued and sub
mitted yesterday to United States
Circuit Judge Hunt. The complain
ant alleges that she is a granddaugh
ter of the late Robert Macbeth, who Is
interred in Laurel Hill Cemetery. A
year ago his wife, Sarah, died and the
cemetery authorities refused to per
mit the body to be buried in the fam
ily plat for the reason that a city
ordinance prohibited any further in
terments. The complainant asks that
the ordinance be declared unconstitu
tional, in that it takes, private prop
erty without due process of law.
On behalf of the city and county.
Assistant City and County Attorney
John S. Partridge argued that the act^
of the Legislature approved In 1869
and under which the cemetery asso
ciation had incorporated provided that
the title to a cemetery lot should be
inalienable forever and should descend
to all hejrs at law. Mr. Partridge con
tended that such act was unconsti
tutional and created a perpetuity. He
contended also that the ordinace pro
hibiting further burials was entirely
within the police power of the mu
nicipality, which was conferred upon
the Supervisors by the constitution
and the charter. He added that the
Supreme Court of California had held
that the ordinance was valid, and It
was ' proper that the United States
courts should follow, the State In
terpretation of the State statutes. The
ordinance was reasonable,, he argued,
as it had been proved that 'the main
tenance of cemeteries In. densely pop
ulated districts was detrimental to the
public health. . /â â  , .'
William S. Wood for the complain
ant denied that a. cemetery was of
itself a nuisance. The courts could
not take judicial. notice that such was
a fact. As to whether any particular
cemetery in a particular locality was
a nuisance was a matter, he satd, for
proof. The speaker attacked the
validity of the "ordinance upon many
grounds, one being that it takes in
the entire city and county, whereas It
should prescribe certain limits within
the boundaries of the city and county.
Superior Judge Makes Error.
- The Supreme Court, decided . yester
day that ! t the Superior Judge of San
Bernardino County had erred In ren
dering Judgment in favor of the plain
tiff in a civil suit because the defend
ant refused to advance one-half of
the reporter's fee. Henry D. Meach
am wanted to recover a piece of real
estate which he alleged was wrong
fully in the possession of the Bear
Valley Irrigation Company. The court
ordered both parties ,to advance the
reporter's pay and the defendant re
fused to do so. The Supreme Court
says the plaintiff should have paid' the
entire amount and had the defendant
lost the suit'- the' reporter's fee might
have been charged : to - the costs ac
count. - â â ."â¢;â â â  '
DEFERS ACTION
UNTIL FEBRUARY
Supervisors' Committee Post
. pones Selection of a Site
for New Public Library
The Supervisors' Joint . Committee
on Finance and Public Utilities yester
day decided to defer action on the se
lection^ of a - public library site until
on or about February 15, 1905. It
is expected that Civic Architect D. H.
Burnham, who Is' evolving plans for
the adornment of San Francisco and
for the creation of a civic center, will
return on the date narried. ' t â¢ a -
The. committee discussed at further
length the two sites already under
consideration, one being block 73,
bounded by Van Ness avgnue, Frank
lin, Hayes and Fell streets, favored
by the Public Library Trustees, and
the other. block 67, bounded by Van
Ness avenue. Polk, Grove and Fulton
streets.
Architect Cahill pleaded for . post
ponement of final action until Burn
ham's return, when his exact views re
garing a civic center could be ascer
tained. William Magee said block 73
could be purchased for $647,000 or
leas.

against ' the selection of block 73.
Hooker & Lent estimated the cost of
block 67 at $575,000. Trustee O'Con
nor submitted a sketch whereby block
73 can be made to conform to the
plan of a civic center and argued that
this selection" would not Interfere with
a panhandle scheme wherever located.
Supervisor Braunhart thought it In
advisable at this time to determine
the establishment of a civic center and
connecting it with the park panhandle
by way of Fulton street and Alamo
Square as suggested by Civic- Architect
Burnham. He said the project would
cost $12,000,000, for which bonds
would have to be issued, which would
endanger the proposed acquisition of
a municipal water supply system,
which would cost at least $30,000,000.
Braunhart favored the immediate se
lection of one of the blocks under
consideration.
The debate was resumed before the
entire board at Its regular meeting 1 and
the postponement of a selection was
thereupon unanimously agreed upon.
A. B. Maguire, on behalf of property
owners in the vicinity of the two pro
posed sites, filed a protest against the
location of a library on. Van Nes3 ave

finish. At one time Condon .was
half a dozen lengths to the good. Back
ing up perceptibly in the stretch, he
lasted Just long enough to down G. W.

neck farther away.
TRACK \nTTC
After investigating the races run by
W. R. Condon at Oakland track, the
stewards of the New California Jockey
Club at the meeting held last night
Jailed to discover any evidence of
fraud. Louis EzeU, owner of W. R.
Condon, stated that on the occasion
â when his horse was beaten when start
ing a favorite, he had wired a friend
at Hot Springs to play him and ex
hibited a letter in reply, substantiating
puch statement. It is a well known
fact that W. R. Condon was attacked
with a cold after reaching Oakland
and was * coughing for a number of
days. Elmer Helgeson also appeared
before the stewards. The Jockey
tlaimej he had exerted his best ef
forts to win with Sol Lichtensteln In
the race won by W. R. Condon on De
cember 24. and there was nothing about
the betting to Indicate otherwise.
Lee Blasingame lost Salable, which
finished second in the opening race.

JOHNSON SIGNS
TO MEET HART
Heavy- Weights to Exchange
Blows at -Woodward's Pa
vilion Late Next Month
GREGGAINS TO REFEREE
Winner of the Contest Is
in Line to Box Jeffries
for Championship Honors
The sporting fraternity is now as
sured of a heavyweight battle next
month. Last night, Jack Johnson, the
colored heavyweight champion of the
world, affixed his signature to a set of
articles calling for a twenty-round go
with Marvin Hart, the pride of the
Elue Grass State. Both men weigh
over 200 po'unds, but Johnson will prob
ably tip the beam a bit heavier than
his opponent.
The meeting took place in Alec Greg
gains' place and the principals came to
terms without much ceremony. Johnson
signed for himself, while Jack Mc-
Ccrmick wielded the pen for Hart. The
men are to do battle on January 27
under the auspices of the San Francisco
Athletic Club, and are to divide half the
receipts â 65 per cent to the winner and
35 to the loser. .
The match should create much inter
est, as the winner is almost sure to be
pitted against Jeffries for the cham
pionship of the world. Johnson has
boxed many times in this city, but
never with a man who was able to give
him a hard light. For this reason, he
has lacked popularity to a certain ex
tent.
In Hart, Johnson will meet a strong
young fellow who is willing and able to
take and return a punch. Hart has
never battjed in this city and for that
reason the bout should be a good draw
ing card. Hart has been an in and
outer since his advent into pugilistic
circles some years ago, but he has
shown his best form lately and bis
friends say he is Jc-hnson's master in
the ring.
Both men agreed to Alec Greggains
as referee. They will fight straight
Marquis of Queensberry rules. The
bout wlil be pulled off at Woodward's
Pavilion, where all the San Francisco
Club's mills take place.
PATCH UP ALL 1HFFI1KEXCES.
Battling Nelson Will Get the lion's
Share uf $9001.
Battling Nelson and his manager,
Ted Murphy, made up in Police Judge
Cabaniss' court yesterday morning.
When the case was railed the boxer
said he would not press the charge
against his manager and agreed to
settle the matter out of court. Be
fore the fighting one left the court
room the Judge administered some
sound advice and Chen bade him fare
well. â¢ â¢ â¢
Manager "Murphy agreed to make
many concessions in 'order to be a
friend of the", 'battling Dane once
again. Murphy settled with Ihe boxer
by agreeing to let him have $6901 of
the $9001 and kÂ»*ep $2100 himself. A
few days ago Murphy said he owned
all the coin, with the exception of
$3700, which was Nelson's share. But
Nelson wanted a larger cut than that
and it was necessary for Murphy to
come to the Dane's terms before peAco
was restored.
The pair will probably leave this
city in a few days. Murphy is anxious
to get Battling away from the glare
of the tenderloin and settle him down
in Hedgewick, where he can rest and
get ready for his next engagement.
Murphy said his charge might meet
Corbett in this city next month, but
nothing definite has been done in the
matter. Nelson has several offers in
view, but it is likely that he will rest
for a month before he enters the ring
to do battle again.
YOUNG CORBETT MAKES
. AN APOLOGY TO GRANEY
Little Boxer Takes Back All the 3Iean
Tilings He Said About Little
Blacksmith.
A bombshell was exploded in
pugilistic -circles last night when
Young Corbett and Eddie Graney
came strolling down the line arm In
arm. The little boxer, who has said
such harsh things about the referee,
now comes out with a signed state
ment in which he admits having done
the latter a wrong and makes an hum
ble apology for all he has said; he also
avers that Graney is an honest man.
.In his statement Corbett boldly says
h<? wants Graney to referee his next
fight, for he considers . him the best
judge of a fistic encounter in the busi
ness. Corbett says he was prejudiced
against Graney mainly through the
stories told him by untrue friends. He
is still of the opinion that , the little
blacksmith gave a wrong decision
when he declared Britt a winner in
that memorable battle last March, but
he is now willing to let bygones be by
gones. Following is a copy of Cor
bett's apology:
To the Editor of The Call â Sir: I deslr*
to do an act of common i justice to a man
who up to the time of his decision in my
encounter with Mr. Britt wib considered by
me to ha th<" greatest referee Th the tvjsine:-*.
Immediately after that unfortunate afT;;lr eouie
of my mlsRuided friends, in -an endeavor to
aÂ»&uage the wound of defeat, lied to me about
the motives of the referee in making' the de
cision and I am tree to say that I Â»ai in
a. . mood to believe such stories and that I
unjustly stated that I had been robbed of
the decision. My investigations since I have
returred to this city have proven to me that
I wag imposed upon, not j by Mr. Graney. but
by my misguided friends, and I therefore d^-
Bire to publicly apologize to Mr. Graney lor
the reflections I have cast upon his honesty:
and while I am still of the opinion that I
an. a better man than Mr. Britt and that Mr.
Orkney's decision wan 'wrong. I desire the
pullic to accept my apology to h'lm as an ac
knowledgment of my own mistake in charg
ing him with anythlns else' than an error uf
Judgment. In -conclusion I want to say that
if I ghall engage in any further boxing matches
that my first suggestion for a referee will bÂ«
Mr. Graney. for I know that he possesses
more knowledge of the art of self-defense
than any man who haa ever officiated in a
like position. I trust you will give to this
communication the same publicity that you
grave to the charge for which I offer this an
a retraction. Yours respectfully, .
â  v v "W. H. ROTHY/ELL, (Young Corbett).

row instead of joy for six-year-old

Feebly asking for the presents
which Santa Claus brought him, the
little boy was 'discovered by his mother
in one corner of the room almost un
conscious. He was removed to the
Hospital, where his condition was pro
nounced serious and his case diag
nosed as heart failure. He lies at the
point of death.

SPEEDY FILLY EQUALS
TIME MADE BY DIVINA
Two Horses Tumble in the
Steeplechase, but Crowd
Enjoys Sport.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 27.â Two rec
ords were equaled at Ascot track to
day. Gold Rose going a mile In 1:38%.
wiiich Is equal to the California record
made by Dlvina at San Francisco, and
Needful galloping the Brooks course, 73
yards leas than a mile and a quarter.
In 2:03. Besides these two features,
there was a steeplechase, in which two
horses fell, and a crowd of 7000 inside
the grounds.
The fourth race was the big feature.
It was a mile and had as starters Gold
Rose, "Waswlft, Bragg, Sheriff Bell and
Ralph Reese. Gold Rose's five straight
victories made her a red hot favorite
at 7 to 5 and an immense play went In
at these figures. Waswift was
second choice, Bragg third and Bell
fourth in the betting.
Gold Rose went to the front from the
start and set a pace that made the
others dizzy. Waswift and Ralph Reese
were the only ones that could get any
where near the chestnut two-year-old
and they finished two, three. Waswift
five lengths back of Rose and the same
distance ahead of Reese. Bragg and
Bell were outrun all the way.
The steeplechase was popular with
the crowd, but had little of the element
of uncertainty after the first two or
three jumps Allegiance, the favorite,
went to the front, jumped clean and won
in a canter. Gray Morn was second.
Ballantyne fell at the third jump and
Flea at the fourth. A stable boy
mounted Flea and rode her to the finish
for third money. Favorites had a good
day, four of them finishing first.

THOMAS MARIO. A DRILLER
"Kill Him, What Is the Difference?"
In Remark, in Answer to Plea
for Mercy.
Not content with taking from him
all his money, two footpads unmerci
fully beat Thomas Mario last night
and left him for dead. Mario was
found on the sidewalk at Sansorae
street and Broadway in a helpless con
dition by a. citizen. He was removed
to the Harbor Emergency Hospital
and treated for bruises about the head
and body and a fractured jaw.
Mario is employed as a driller in
Daden and came to the city yester
day to have a good time. He had $25
on his person. As he passed the cor
ner mentioned shortly before 11
o'clock two men suddenly attacked
him. One of them struck him with a
sandbag, felling him to the ground.
Iioth then kicked him. Mario begged
the thugs to have mercy on him, as
he would give them all hiR money.
While one searched him the other
continued the kicking. Mario again
pleaded for mercy and one of the
thugs replied. "Oh, kill him, what is
the difference."
Mario does not remember anything
further of the incident, as he lost his
senses. He cannot give a good de
scription of his assailant*.

DECLARE WIDOW
IS A SUBSTITUTE
Evidence That Lum Quoia
Was Brought From China
Under Name of Another
The last complexity has been added
to the Chinese puzzle over the estate
of Chew Bine Quota, and, after the
arguments, which may be made to
day, the problem will go up to Judge
Coff ey for solution. It developed in
the examination yesterday that a na
tive born daughter of Chinatown waa
taken to China by her mother and left
there and that another girl was sub
stituted and brought here under the
native girl's name and registered. The
substituted maiden, it is declared, was
none other than Lum Quoia, * the
woman who says she 1b the widow of
the labor contractor and who (testified
that she was born in California and
had never been to China. f
It was testified yesterday that Kg*
Sui Ling, who was one of Quoia's
secondary wives, went to Cliina
with her little daughter, ( Chew
Mee Ho. Their departure cer
tificate was offered in evidence.
Ho, it ls~:said, was left in the
Flowery Kingdom, grew up and was
married. . The mother in 1893 re
turned, with Lum Quoia, who had been
purchased as a slave for the - con
tractor; the girl was passed as Mee
Ho. and In February, 1894, got a resi
dence certificate under that name, Ng
Sui Ling getting her certificate at the
same time. Copies of these cer
tificates were brought from Washing
ton and offered In evidence. ".-.,â¢;
Witnesses testified to having been
present at the departure, of the two
from China and others to having been
present at the arrival here and the
identity of the alleged widow and the
substituted girl was sworn in.
Other evidence was offered in re
buttal ol the testimony of Low Boon,
brother of the alleged widow in
China, and the case was closed.
Horse Too Weak to Walk.
W. S. Morse, a plumber at 1801
Market street, was 'arrested yesterday
morning on Kearny street by Police
man W. T. Hooper on a charge of cru
elty to animals. Morse was driving a'
wagon. along Kearny street and at the
corner of. Bush the horse fell. Hoop
er happened' to be â  passing, arrested
Morse and locked him up in the 'City
Prison. The' horse was so weak that
it could . not have walked any farther.
POWDER TRUST
MEETS DEFEAT
Order Restraining Sale of
Chemical Company Stock
Is Dissolved by Kerrigan
INJUNCTION IS DENIED
No Proof That Assessment
; of Peyton "Shares Was
Illegal or Fraudulent
Either an assessment of $30,000 on Its
3000 shares in the Peyton Chemical
Company must be paid tÂ»y the powder
trust, or the stock will be sold for the
delinquency. Yesterday Judge Kerri
gan dissolved the. temporary order
granted by him on December 10, re
straining the sale of the stock, and de
nied the application for an Injunction.
The foundation of the suit of the
trust, otherwise the I. E. du Pont de
Nemours' Powder Company was based
upon the allegation that the Peyton
Chemical Company would not permit
an inspection of ,the books by R. S.
Pennlman.to whom a power of attorney
had been given and who had been au
thorized to have fifty of the chemical
company's shares transferred to his
name. It was therefore pleaded by the
trust that it, as a stocknolder, did not
know whether to protect its shares or
let them be sold. The affidavits .on
both sides were voluminous and the
arguments protracted, but Judge Kerri
gan did not consider the numberless
complexities raised in issue. He de
eided that it had not been charged or
proved that the assessment was fraud
ulent and therefore it was not the place
of a court of equity to, grant the in
junction demanded. The proper pro
ceeding would have been in mandamus
to compel permission for an inspection
of the books and had this been resorted
to, says the Judge, the plaintiff would
doubtless have gained its point.
In its affidavits 'defending the suit
the Peyton Company charged that the
trust and its subsidiary corporations
had conspired to wreck the local con
cern which was prepared to become a
competitor in the manufacture of
smokeless powder. The chemical com
pany owes $113,000 to the Du Ponts,
which must be paid on December 31 or
$293,000 worth of collateral would be
sacrificed. Included in the security for
the debt are 1600 shares of Peyton's
stock in his company and if this were
lost the trust would get control of its
competitor. To meet the debt the as
sessment was levied and the failure of
the Du Ponts to pay. and the subse
quent litigation, it was charged, wnM
part of the plan to crush or control Â»Tie
Peyton company.
MINERAL LANDS
ARE IN DANGER
State 3Iiiiiiig- Bureau Says
So to President and to
Governor of California
The attention of President Roose
velt has been called by the trustees of
the State Mining Bureau and the
State Mineralogist to an abuse in the
entry' of -lands in California. In a
memorial thev have set forth tKat in
the large area of land recently re
leased by the Government Zrom the
forestry reserves in California there
are 1,097,120 acres in the Redding,
Susanville, Sacramento, Stockton and
Vlsalia land districts, the greater part
of which having been surveyed, by
contract, many years ago by i:Â»en en
tirely unacquainted with geological
conditions, has never been properly
divided.' It is therefore urged that
the United States Geological Survey
should determine, before lands are
restored to entry, whether they are
mineral in character, otherwise they
will be lost to miners.
Yesterday the report of the Min
ing Bureau trustees and of State Min
eralogist Aubury to the Governor was
Issued' from the State Printing Office.
This is published in pamphlet form.
Therein Mineralogist Aubury returns
to the attack upon those who are
standing ready to get possession of
mineral lands under misleading desig
nations. He sets forth for the en
lightenment of the Governor and the
Legislature that it is imperative that
action should be taken to protect the
mineral lands from scrippers and
from all except mineral entries. "This
department is in possession," so al
leges Aubury, "of evidence, that par
ticularly in the Marysville and Susan
ville districts there are tracts of min
eral lan<Js affected by the order re
storing lands to entry."
Appointments Xot Valid.
Judge Sloss yesterday dismissed the
application for a writ of mandate and
ordered judgment, for the respondent
in the suit of Paul Bellemans against
Auditor Harry Baehr to compel the
auditing of Bellemans' September sal
ary warrant for $66 66 as extra deputy
In the Recorder's office. Bellemans
and four others were appointed in
September at salaries of $100 a month,
but their warrants were turned down
on the contention that their appoint
ments had not been submitted by the
Supervisors to the Mayor in accord
ance with the provisions of the char
ter. The contention that the appoint
ments were therefore invalid is sus
tained by the ruling of Judge Slosa.
i SI. A. Newell, the marine insurance under
writer, received a message by wire from Seat
tle last evening saying that Captain J. H.
Kinder, formerly of the steamship Mongolia*,
has b#en 'app61nted master of the new steam
ship Minnesota of the Hill ;llne of Oriental
vessels. Captain' Rlnder has been In the em
ploy of the Occidental and Oriental and Pacific
Mail lineo of steamers for many years, and ho
is well â  known to tlwse who travel the trans
pacific route.

CONTROL OF TRUSTS.
THERE is really nothing- new in the discovery that some of the
plans submitted by corporation Commissioner Garfield had
been proposed before. The suggestion that, corporations en
gaged in interstate commerce, as the trusts are, should be subjected
to a Federal charter, or franchise, is certainly not new, and there is
"no evidence that the Commissioner intended to disclose it as a dis
covery. The practice of such corporations seeking a New Jersey or
a, West Virginia or Kentucky charter; is no strange thing in the
present condition of the law. The Federal Government can nullify
all such charters by imposing a taxAipon' them, just as the State
banks were extirpated by a Federal tax on their business to make
room for the national banks operating under a Federal franchise.
As the country has undoubtedly reached the beginning of a pol
icy, of Federal regulation and control of interstate commerce in all
its forms, it is well to become familiar with an issue that will enter
largely into the politics of the future. The Supreme Court, in its'
affirmation of the constitutionality of the interstate commerce law,
has deposited ample power with Congress, and the expediency of its
use is demonstrated. The method will be the subject of discussion.
The power of the Federal Government over franchises and charters
haslhe advantages of the possibility of simplicity and oneness. One
State may warrant powers under a franchise that another does not.
There is evidence that the States have competed with each other
in the liberality of these franchise laws, and corporations now seek
charters where the obligation imposed is the lightest and the re
strictions are the least. A Federal charter obsbletes all of this, and
can dictate the conditions of the business which it authorizes. It
can exact a royalty from that- business if it choose, just as it takes
certain taxes out of the national banks in return for {he privileges
which they enjoy. It can do-more than this. It can restore com
petition in trade wherever that element has been destroyed by
'trust . policy.
â¢ â¢ Under the law of California if a transportation . corporation
lower its rates at a given point, to meet or prevent competition, that
â¢rate cannot be raised again except by consent of the State, granted
through its Railroad Commission. This is a long and suggestive
Step in the processes that now interest the Federal Government.
The President's message has put the whole subject before Congress
ajid the country, and methods are now being thrashed out. It is
.entirely competent for a Federal franchise, to require that when a
trust dealing in the necessaries of life, engaged in interstate com
merce, shall lower its price at a given point to meet or destroy com
petition, it. shall sell at the. same rate wherever it is in the market,
and shall not raise its price anywhere without the consent of pub
lic authority.
â  In all that has been printed about the Standard Oil Company
there threads a tragic element in the history of its destruction of
competition. The power to do this concentrated all the vast profits
of the business in the hands of Mr. Rockefeller/ and gave him con
trol of sums so large that he can easily invade and control the whole
transportation system of the country, or seize any other branch of
business and monopolize it. So it has come to pass that newspaper
readers almost daily learn of the Rockefeller invasion of this or that
line of trade, and there has risen the specter of Rockefeller, the
billionaire, owning all of the enterprises of the country, dictating
their methods and controlling at will the measures of their profits
by his control of prices, grasped by the destruction of competition.
If the franchises under which he operates are outlawed by the Fed
eral Government, to be replaced by Federal charter, in which metes
and bounds are set around the power of his wealth, competition will
spring up everywhere and his absorption of so great a portion of
the country's substance will cease. The profit that he takes now as
an annual accretion of his power and wealth will be divided among
many, and there will come a more natural and, therefore, a more
wholesome commercial condition. - -
'. T.o make such a plan operative even .the Federal franchise is
hot necessary. It is a constitutional feature proper in a statute reg
ulatijig interstate commerce. The power to lower prices at a com
peting.point until competition is destroyed is the same
power now secretly employed by such railroads as give rebates.
The rebate is for the purpose of destroying competition. The ship
per who enjoys rebates will soon have all of the business. The
President has said "Rebates must cease/' That means that as far
as competition has been destroyedby rebates it shall be restored to
life again. If the law compel universality of the price fixed at one
point to destroy competition, the operation of such a system becomes
automatic. The price cannot be lowered secretly. It must be pub
lic in" the nature of things, and every buyer everywhere will have
notice, and can move to enforce the penalty if not permitted the
same privilege in price that is enjoyed at the point of competition.
.'The President's remedy for rebates is legal and not socialistic.
So is the suggested remedy for the monopoly that is produced by
destroying competition. These remedies are conservative of prop
erty. ; Socialism is destruction of property. The two systems arc
submitted to the judgment of the people.' It is a contest between
reason and unreason; between the conservative and destructive!
forces of societv. I
THE GRAND JURY'S WORK.
THE Grand Jury is at work upon the charges of wholesale bood
ling in Chinatown which have been brought -against the Police
Department in general and specifically against several officials
in the city government. The members of the inquisitorial body arc
neithejr' betraying their hand nor allowing one iota of evidence which
rtl^y/nay have gathered to escape and disrupt their plans. The hope
or the people of San Francisco is lodged in this" quasi-judicial tri
bunal, which is expected to be a safeguard for the people's interests,
and is counted upon to act independently and without fear or favor.
The Grand Jury has a hard task set for it. The collection of
hush-money from the gambling-houses of Chinatown is no new fea
ture, of official perquisites; other investigations have been of more
or less avail in the past. Through all the maze of perjury on the
part of the Celestials themselves and of evasion on the' part of
those who are supposed to "pass the sack up higher," there must be
some valiant and strenuous -winnowing of the chaff, if the kernel
of responsibility for the alleged frauds is to be found. It is sincerely
to be hoped that the present Grand Jury may have the persistency
and the moral conviction to push* their investigation to that end, no
matter what shadow of officialdom may fall athwart the course.
Whether the efforts of the Grand Jury avail or not, there re
mains to the honest voters of San Franciscothe comforting reflection
that next fall will bring .with it a chance to change the administra
tion of the city. One way to lessen the number of investigations
and probings into the admistration of the city's business is to make
certain the integrity of that administration. .
IS THE' CZAR INSANE?
*T"* HE information about the mental condition of the Czar, given
I out by Dr. Jordan, is of world-wide interest. The insanity of
' . the young r autocrat would 'â¢ account '' for some features of his
reign that have heretofore been mysteries. No reason has been
given out from St. Petersburg for the Czar's violation of the rights
of Finland. Those rights were solemnly guaranteed in perpetuitv
.in 1808, and were safeguarded in the coronation oath of the Czars,
jast as the rights of Scotland are part of the coronation oath of the
sovereigns of Great Britain..
. . The Finns are Scandinavians attached to the Lutheran church,
and were guaranteed a large measure* of self-government when
their- country became a\Russian Grand Duchy. ..The Czar is the

autocrat of all the Russias, but by solemn treaty he was only Grand
Duke of Finland. The Finns prospered' under self-government.
Their institutions of' learning were' among the best in the world.
Their loyalty to Russia was 1 often manifested. Their scholars and
warriors added luster to the crown of^thcCzar. They, had done
nothing to deserve slavery. But their example ofÂ« peace,- prosperity
and-freedom was in great contrast to the condition pi ignorance and
degradation jn Russia proper. ' 'â â â â .â â â¢...:
Without cause, pretext, or provocation the little. Czar violated
his coronation bath, violated the compact, of Borgo, destroyed the
liberty of Finland, its religious* freedom, its system of education, its
free press and the happiness of its people. Where once was a con
tented and prosperous t population now is a forlorn* herd i of slaves.-
Surely it was the act of a* madman, arid is to be accounted* for only
on the theory of the ICzar.'s.. insanity.;.. : : . . ; _ .-^, â --.: ; ,ju; : ;â â <-.. V.Y
cle. The affair is a: huge joke. The
cynic before you, who plainly Imagines
himself to be his majesty, is in reality
but a royal jester, whose chief distinc
tion from others of the motley Is that
he wears his cap and bells with a "dif
ference. .". " : ; . ; â '. ' - - â¢ ,..."â " .
Confirmed cynicism invariably is a
pose or a profession. In. the beginning
it undoubtedly was sincere, especially
if love was Its occasion; once it. was a
mood of pain, or of Insulted strength,
which sought to give .back blow for
blow. But afterwardâ why, afterward
it found Its performance took with the
multitude, and, yielding to a human
weakness, it 'allowed itself to "become
a demagogue; pandering to a general
prejudice for bitterness. ' .
Few men at heart are thorough
cynics about loye.and the high estate of
womanhood, even when, frtfm sheer
perversity or for. personal â¢aggrandize
ment, they go out of their way to make
the world believe so. In some niche of
their souls there is enshrined* a Lady
of, Holy Love to whom they bow the
knee..
Occasional cynicism is just a grown
up way of 'â¢making believe" for the
sake of an acute sensation. . Most
adults are like children in needing a
gootl cry now and then, and In trying to
pry the flood gates open by an Ima
gined sorrow. In ten cases out of
twelve, when you see a woman weep
ing, you may safely take it for grant
ed that" she . is weeping comfortably.
And cynicism Is : for man what tears
are for a . woman. : Both are means
which nature has provided to satisfy
a crying need.
The healthy attitude toward love has,
of course, a grain or two of cynicism
In It. Any man who stands firm on
his own feet laughs " at the pretty,
plausible 'lies which sentimental sages
offer to him daintily upon a gilded
salver. A flne ; boy"s attitude toward
love i% similar. 'He knows that he is
"soft"- ' when-,, he . : gets "dead stuck" on
a glrl^and;, liter, if disillusioned, he'is
honest enough, to confess without put
ting on airsr-tbat he la "soured."
This Is -the attitude of a philosopher
who mentally takes note of a mirror's
silvered back â¢ when gazing upon its
shining face. This was , the cynicism
of that Maine school boy who, after
reading In the Aeneid of the Carthn . -
nlan queen's. futile death upon the fu
neral pyre; wrote on a slip of paper
for the delectation of the girls:
"Pass It On.

when Paxton came up, and gave him
her hand.
"So you did come, after all? And
late as usual." .... â¢â¢
The old general rambled away
toward the nearest tea table, and. they
were alone under the holly star.
"How did Viola Arnold come here?"
Mrs. Dunderdale's eyebrows lifted
prettily: as . she laughed. A woman
may still be pretty and charming at
fifty-two, when she is a study In soft
grays and delicate pinks, with brown
eyes.
"Now please don't scold me here,
pp.xton," she said soothingly. "You
always were a fussy sort of a boy.
Isn't she a dear? Come over here in
the. smilax bower and I'll tell you a
little about her." Not all. though; just
enough so that you won't look at
me as* if I had been stealing candy
from a baby. Do you know- her?
"Know. her? Of course I know her,"
cried Paxton. "And the . last time I
saw her; was in July in her father's
palace in Florence, the old Cellini
palace, it. is. She sang then, too, but
it was to please us. her guests. And
old Scalli. yonder was one of Arnold's
beggar geniuses, living on his bounty.
I want to know what his daughter Is
doing here like this?"
"Like this?" Mrs. Dunderdale shook
her head at him' reproachfully, "Pres
' ton. that lovely child came to me only
; two weeks ago almost penniless. You
i know what Bruce Arnold was. He
i lived up. to every cent of his income,
! and ran a little beyond it. Last Au
gust * he died suddenly. Didn't you
hear of it?"
. "I came back home by way of
Japan and stayed on in Tokio a little
' while." said Paxton. "I haven't heard
a word of it." '
â¢ "Well, that's all. You can imagine
/the rest. .There are no relatives, no
one at all for her to- go to; and the
old â¢ palace : was robbed,. literally rob

inquired his wife.
. "Now, that's what puzzles me; but I

prob'ly half of 'em that think they
are better than the other half." Still,
it's sorter rough to refer to 'em as â

It was very quiet across the hall.
Paxton passed through the library
and the smoking den and hesitated at
the half-open door of the music-room.
She was alone, standing at the old
Japanese music rack In the corner.
The pale yellow light from the cluster
of opalescent electric bulbs above her
head shone softly on her dark hair,
where the â¢ red and green of a holly
sprig showed.
As the door opened she raised her
head.
"I found the quaintest old carol. Slg
nor,. 'The Holy Star/ Mrs. Dunderale
sent me to look for it. She called me
that to-night, her holly starâ Paxton!"
Paxton closed the door behind him.
He wished ehe would not look so white
and scared and altogether frightened.
It had been his fault, that night back
in -Florence, when she had looked at
him like that, and had w told him to go
away and leave her forever.
"I heard you sing," he said. "Mrs.
Dunderdale told me after you were
here."
"Why did you come after me?"
"I should never have gone away," an
swered Paxton unsteadily. "It was all
my fault. Won't you say 'Merry Christ

The door opened softly arid Signor
ScalU's bushy* bead was inserted In

figures it was withdrawn and the door
closed noiselessly.

* Last evening His [ Imperial! Highness
Prince Fushimi of Japan again partook
of the hospitality, .of. the West. He was
the guest of honor at a dinner at the
Pacific Union Club tendered by ft. P.
Schwerln. and so skillfully was the af
fair carried out that the distinguished
visitor had little opportunity to- regret
his Inability to speak the English
tongue. The toasts were short and
there were few of them; the hours not
pleasantly occupied in discussing the
elaborate menu were filled In with mu
sic and vaudeville. "With rare tact the
Prince was royally entertained and ap
parently appreciated the feeling of good
will toward his country that was mani
fest on every hand. ' : .
The dinner was given in the red
room of the club. The decorations were
beautiful and in keeping with the.na
tionality of the guest of honor, at the
same time befitting the spirit of the
season honored by all Christendom. The
color scheme was red. Red Japanese
lanterns, festooned with evergreens,
shed a soft light over the tables, which
were burdened with flaming poirisettias
and Christmas berries. In the center
of the main table was a dwarfed oak,
characteristic of Jsippon, that sparkled
with mimic snow. Around the . walls
Christmas trees were arranged to com
plete the decorative scheme that well
served its purpose â to knit the artistic
and festal sentiments of the two lands
that were Joined in friendship at the
board. V* 'â¢>:."' s\'r^ 7
TOASTS ARE DRUXK.
Prince Fushimi was accompanied by
members of his suite. Shortly after'his
arrival at the club the host called his
guests to the banquet laoard. Prince
Fushimi was seated at Mr. Schwerin's
right and General MacArthur at his
left. An hour or two passed before the
cigars were passed around and then
Mr. Schwerin spoke of the pleasure it
gave him to add in a measure tc/ the
entertainment of the country's distin
guished visitor.
Prince Fushimi, through- his in
terpreter, then ottered a toast to the
President c-f the United States, which
was drank amid cries of "bravo."
Mr. Schwerin then called upon Gen
erar MacArthur to offer a toast to the
Emperor of Japan. Rising from his
seat General MacArthur said: ,
â¢â¢Gentlemen, I ask you to join me in
a toast to the health of his Imperial,
Majesty, the Emperor of Japan." This
toast was heartily greeted and then Mr.
Schwerin said:
"Fifty years ago. In 1855, the United
States' of < America extended the hand
of good fellowship to Japan. Let us
hope that the grasp of good fellowship
Commodore Perry extended to Japan
will always be extended by America
and that the happy relations existing,
between these countries shall always'
continue. And with this sentiment in
mind I now ask you to join me in a
toast to our guest, a member of the
imperial household of Japan, Prince
â¢Fushimi."
VAUDEVILLE ENTERTAINS.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,., WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 28, 1904.
'ed. . A toast to the health of the host
was then proposed' by Consul Uyerio.
This 'was drunk and then the vaude
ville was on. The orchestra that had
rendered selections during the discus
sion of the menu was called upcm to
accompany the artists that had been
secured to enteVtain the banqueters.
Upon the boards of a stage at the
north end of the red room the enter
tainers held forth for an hour, . and
though there were songs and Instru
mental selections that would win ap
plause on any stage, it was the mov
ing pictures that pleased the imperial
guest the. most. A picture of the Em
peror of Japan was first thrown on the
screen; then a picture of President
Roosevelt. These were warmly applaud
ed, but the one that was greeted with
the : most spontaneous outburst was
that of the martyred McKlnley.
Other pictures were shown, another
sonpr was sung and then the banqueters
engaged in an informal discussion until
the guest of honor, accompanied by
the members of his suite, departed. Mr.
Schwerin's dinner is the last function
Prince Fushimi will enjoy on this visit
to the United States, for he sails to
day for his home on . the steamship
Mongolia, and. It Is said, by members
of his suite, carrying with him naught
but pleasant recollections.

GAY FUNCTION
OF CALIFORNIA
CLUB MEMBERS
BY LAURA BRIDE POWERS.
That was a gay affair â for some â that
given by the California Club
yesterday at Pioneer Hall, and pleas
ant for all, even for the four lone men
presentâ the sweet singers from Alo
ha-land.
Assuredly the heroic woman who
sought to seat 175 fellow club women
of divergent political and social faiths
amicablyâ aye, even happilyâ verily, I
say unto you, she ,1s a wonder! And
when she succeeds, as did TArs: A. W.
Scott, she has proven herself a diplo
mat and a symbol of mystic wisdom.
The luncheon was served in the ban
quet hall of the Pioneer building, .where
a flr forest had sprung up in a single
night. Woodwardla lent its sweet
graces and toyon berries their glow.
The table whereat the founders of
the club were seated was further
graced with broad bands of scarlet rib
bon, while the board of . the president
of the State Federation, Mrs. George
Law Smith, was graced with ferns and
berries. The other tables bore pretty
red name cards and sprays of berries.*
Assuredly was it a Yuletide function.
'Twas given out that all set toasts
were taboo. So they were, and t'was
noised, about that, nobody was .sad
dened by .the dearth\ The only speech
was one of welcome by the president,-
Mrs. Aylett R. Cotton, which . was
short, reminiscent and congratulatory.
Music there- was in plentyâ those
sweet, soul-haunting melodies of the
Hawaiians. Two clever monologues by
.a clever little"; maid, Miss Irish, were
well received,, as was a pithy satire on
the club, written by Dr. Dorothea
Moore and given by Miss Merle Mad
dern. This pretty maid gives promise
of a clever dramatic career, practicing
â¢well, for one so young, -the divine- art
of repression. 4 .

Upon the adjournment of the meeting
the regents present . adjourned to the
St. Francis Hotel, where they partook
of luncheon as the. guests of Regent
Dohrmann. During the luncheon the
regents discussed the question of legis
lation to be sought- at the coming ses
sion of the Legislature.
The only extraordinary appropriation
to be asked is that for the construc
tion of. the proposed College of Agri
culture building. All other sums de
sired pertain to the ordinary^ expenses
of the. university. ,, The discussion \on
this question was .merely preliminary
and it ,is. the, .purpose of the. board, to
meet again some time during" this week
to definitely determine. /what action
shall be " taken to procure the [ heeded
legislative 'action.
Regret lor the mistakes of our youth

TEXAS WANTS TO BENEFIT
BY THE ARID LAND ACT
Land Owners Agree With People of
" New Mexico on Joint Use '
of Water.
EL PASO, Dec. 27.â El Paso Valley
land owners to-day formed a water
users' association and pledged 6000
acres to the Elephant Butte dam proj
ect of the reclamation service, agree
ing to work jointly with the New
Mexico land owners for the dam. The
dam will afford all the water needed
to reclaim a great portion of the arid
land in both New Mexico and Texas.
Congress must first extend the privi
lege, to Texas, however, as it is not
one of the States to which the arid
land act applies.
The action to-day ends a long and
bitter fight .between Texas and New
Mexico for the water rights of the Rio
Grande River, and assures the recla
mation of 180.000 acres.'

YOUNG GIRL
JUMPS TO
HER DEATH
Hurls Herself .From Third
Story Window of a House
in New York Under
Mysterious Circumstances
JOCKEY JOHN H0AE
INVOLVED IN CASE
Wearing Apparel of Well
Known Rider Found in
the Room From Which
Woman Leaped to Street
NEW YORK, Dec. 27.â A young
woman known as Cecil Hall, but whose
right name is Cecilia Moss, killed her
self to-day by jumping from the third
story window of a house near Broad
way in West Forty-sixth street- From
articles found in the room from which
she jumped it is believed that with her
before she hurled herself to the street
was John Hoar, a jockey, who had re
cently returned to this country .from
Russia. It is believed the woman and
Hoar cam* to this city from Washing
ton, D. C.
Her act created a commotion In the
neighborhood, where It was declared
that the girl was screaming for help
after she was seen to fling herself
from the window.
Coroner Scholer took charge of thÂ«
case to-day and gave it as his opinion
that the girl had been detained against
her will and was attempting to es
cape. The woman's clothing was
found scattered about the room from
which she leaped. y-
She had been at the house only a
few hours before her death.
The suit case found in the room
contained women's and men's clothing.
The police believe that the marks on
the man's clothing show that it was
bought in Warsaw, Poland. A man's
overcoat bore the name of "Hoar."
Other articles of men's clothing bore
the mark "J. H." The Initials found
on the clothing and on silver-backed
hairbrushes found -in the suitcases
correspond with those of the jockey.
The tailor whose name appears on
the overcoat found at the Forty-sixth
street house said to-night that he
made the coat for J. Hoar, the jockey.
Among the woman's effects was a
newspaper clipping which said that
Jockey Hoar headed the winning list
of jockeys on Russian mounts and
spoke in complimentary terms of him.
Hoar was located in Hoboken by
detectives, who are trying to find out
what he knows about the dead woman.
Hoar informed the police to-night
that the woman was in his company
yesterday afternoon and that he went
with her to the door of her house.
There he left her, he said, and about
an hour later he called her up by tele
phone. She appeared to be in good

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. Deo. 27. â Inspired bjj a good de
mand wheat opened strong, with May up Hffi
ftc to %&%c at fl 12*i<S>113ft. fie weather
map reported cold weather as prevailing . In
the Â»;orthwest and rapidly spreading across the
whole countrj'. The cold wave male the prob
ability of reduced deliveries of wheat by
farmers much more certain than had been
previously apparent. Another factor Influential
in produclnx a bulge was a cablegram from a
Chicago crop expert In Argentina. The tele
gram stated that much of the wheat crop In
Argentina had been ripened prematurely by
frost. From the first tap of the bell lively
demand was In evidence from commission
houses, but sellers were few. In consequence
the market Bteadily sained In strenKUi, not
withstanding reports indicating that the long
drought In the winter wheat territory had been
broken by rain or snow. Demand for cash
wheat, both in the Northwest and Southwest,
was greatly Improved and this helped to cre
ate ' a more- bullish sentiment In speculative
trading. Primary -receipts also were much
smaller than for the corresponding day a year
ago. but owing to wire trouble these statistics
were incomplete. During the latter part of tho
session a leader of the bull crowd was a free
seller. Increased offerings found ready buyers,
however, and prices continued to .mount. The
market closed at the highest point of the ses
sion. May being quoted at |1 14ft@l 14%.
The corn market held firm throughout the
session. May closed at 45%@45%c.
The oats market waa influenced by Btrength
In other grains and by the anticipated Increase
In consumption that would result from zero
weather- May closed at 31 %c.
Provisions started strong on smaller receipts
of hogs, but at the advance offerings were
larger than the buying orders could absorb.
May pork closed at $12 87ft; May lard at $7 20
and May ribs at $6 72ft@Â«Â».

Wheat and Otlicr Grains.
WHEAT FREIGHTSâ Spot rate* continue
nominal on the basis of the last reported char
ter, which was that of the French bark Max
at 16s 3d. The shipowners' combine, having
been unable to maintain their - rates fixed
seme months ago, are now making concessions
to get business. At the recent meeting in
Paris of the Sailing Shipowners' International
Union it was decided to make a slight change
in the minimum rates asked by placing the
rates on a ' 2500 ton capacity and allowing a
reduction of l>4d for every additional 250
tons, i This, on most of the grain vessels
which lead here, makes a reduction of 3d.
Meanwhile ships continue to leave - this port
in ballast, seeking business. The chartered
wheat fleet in port has a registered tonnage
of 14,390. against 16,200 tons on the same
de.tt> last year; disengaged. 36,371 tons, against
ui.270; on the way to tills port, 157,200 tons,
atrainst 193,000.
WHEAT â Prostrated -wires yesterday Inter

8S.000; Indian, 221,000- Australian, 23,000.

but with heavy realizing at the advance. This
market continued a weather one and was firm,

increase its facilities for handling the
fruit product of Northern California,
and J. S. Leeds, manager of the com
pany's refrigerating car service, who
arrived from Chicago several days
ago, is now rooking for suitable boats,
which he Intends to -charter ~f or river
traffic. Yesterday â¢ Manager -, Leeds
stated that the Santa Fe' Company
will soon award a contract to one of
the local ship-building firms for the
construction of a sternwheel river
boat, which will be hurried to com
pletion in order that it may-be ready
for service at the opening -of next
year's fruit-shipping season.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 2S. 1904.
THOMAS SHIRLEY VIOLENTLY
ASSAULTS SANTA CLAUS.
Tears Down Mrs. Maddox's
Christmas Tree.
Chinaman Uproots Telephone
BY JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
If her Tuletlde party had not been so
perfectly free from discord up to the
time of Thomas Shirley's belated ar
rival at her dwelling, 215 Tehama
street, Mrs. Maddox opined the shock
conveyed to all those present bv that
gentleman's outrageousâ she might say
blackguardly- â behavior would have
been less poignant. But she had
been repeatedly assured by her guests
that never in all their born days had
they been treated to such a thoroughly
good time, . and she was enjoying the
comfort that comes with the finding of
one's hospitality appreciated when
Thomas Shirley burst in and meta
morphosed the atmosphere.. Without
apparent provocation he uprooted
the Christmas tree' and hurled it
to the street, then he violently
assaulted the gentleman who, in
the guise of Kris ,Kringle, had
distributed the presents and at that
rhdhient was presiding over jthe punch
bowl. Neither the screams of affright
ed women nor the expostulations of in
dignant men served to stay the ruth
less hand of Thomas Shirley. He
plucked the cotton-batting beard from
the face of the masquerader and
slapped his cheeks with it, then rent
the artificial furcoat in vicious effort
to disrobe the! wearer of it. When the
hostess partly recovered from the semi
swoon into which the unlooked-for in
terruption of the festivity had cast
herâ and she felt certain that till her
dying day she would never entirely re
cover from its effectsâ she summoned
the police and ordered Thomas Shirley
into their, custody.
"What did you do it for?" Police
Judge Mogan asked the defendant.
"Aw, 'twasn't as much of .a rough
house as Mrs. Maddox says it was,"
he responded. "I wasn't de only dis
turber of de peace. Some of de odders
cut up ji3t as much as I done."
He will be sentenced to-day.

Mrs. O'Rarely was pricing the
Christmas foliage offered for .sale on
Sutter street by G. Rossi when James
Lossari, a rival seller of green goods,
offered to barter similar wares for less
money. Then the two "men clinched
and wrestled and clawed' and punched
while Mrs. O'Rarely shouted "Po-leece"
until they were arrested.' Judge Conlan
will hear more about the affair to-day.
"What do you say to this charge of
begging on the street?" Judge .Fritz
asked James Rogers,' and James at
tempted to respond, -but could 'get no
further than, "I ge-ge-ge-ge." owing
to vocal impediment. So the Judge re
marked that- with seventy-four cases
on the .calendar he could not afford to
waste time on a stutterer, and the case
was dismissed.' if- < "! ' ' : ; :
Frank Williams, a druggist, was ac

wife, the accuSer being his landlord,

were requested to move, but stood on
their putative rights/ 1 and then Mr.
Retsloff Insisted on enforcing his puta
tive authority, and "one word led to
another" until Mr. Retsloff invoked
the law's aid. Judge ! Mogan will per

Joseph Hawkins â¢ had been steadily
tippling for, about a month when the
Yuletide flood completed ".the gradual
submersion of his facultie's, and there
was no questioning his insanity as he

berated the court and everyone and
Everything connected with it. He was
sentenced to thirty days' deprivation of
alcoholic stimulants. 1 ,'
Miss Nellie Gilbert remembered hav
ing drunk one eggnog on Christmas,
morning, and she suspected the drink
was "doped," for it was news to her
that Patrolman Hurd had arrested her
for parading Powell street, near Mar

ture hat around her head and shouting
"MÂ«rry Chris'mus an' happy noo year"
in loud voice. Judge Conlan dismissed

. Manuel Saleki was among the strap
hangers in a Mission-street car early
Sunday . morning- and was greatly an
noyed by having his tenderest corn
pressed by the feet of other passengers
erery time the vehicle jolted and they
swung and staggered. So he vented his
mingled agony and rage by uttering
profane words and finally dashed his
fist through a window. ' He was arrest

Nee Toy Quong, about 18 years of
age, attired herself in a tailor-made
gown and white broadcloth coat, en
cased her tiny feet in patent leather
shoes with French heels, donned a
heavy black wig and picture hat, and
with skirts clutched a la kangaroo girl
strutted Montgomery avenue until Pa
trolman Minehan arrested her because
her inability to speak English prevent
ed him ascertaining by other means
whether she was a vagrant. When she
appeared before Judge Conlan her. al
mond eyes were crimson-fringed by
nocturnal weeping and her Caucasian
finery was rather bedraggled. In

who and what she is, and the case was
continued until he is ready to report.
John O'Hara said he came in from
Ocean View to spend Christmas with
some of his friends resident on lower
Commercial street, and while walking
down that thoroughfare stepped upon
a banana rind and slid into the open
doorway of a "wine joint," where he
was nursing a dislocated ankle when a
policeman picked him up and boked
him for vagrancy/ Then the polices
man proved that John's story was an
entire fabrication â that he was, in
fact, a professional vagabond â and
Judge Fritz sentenced him to ten
days' imprisonment.
Chung. Fow had decided to escort
his fiancee,. Suey Fat, to the Chinese
Theater last Sunday evening, and with
a view to notifying her of his inten
tion squandered several nickels in fu
tile effort to communicate with her by
telephone, his attentions to the young
lady being frowned upon by her
father, who had forbidden him calling
at her dwelling. It was not Suey
Fat's fault, but the miserable ineffi
ciency of . the special telephone ser^
vice. in the Celestial quarter that pre
vented Chung â  Fow communicating
with Sfley Fat by wire, and to the.
central station he went with determi
nation to get either the desired switch
or his wasted nickels refunded. The'
chief operator said he could . have
the switch by adding another five
cents to his -outlay, and Chug Fow
cheerily, subscribed the coin, because
he considered a meeting with Suey Fat
worth much more money than he had
already invested to accomplish that
end.
"You sittee down, dlop um nick an'
waitee," quoth the chief operator, and
Chung Fow obeyed. Pie waited, with
receiver placed to ear, while the chief
operator pulled out and Inserted plugs
and shouted until. theater time" loomed
nigh and still no word from Suey
Fat could he obtain. And the door
of- the playhouse was open and the
most desirable seats had been sold
when the chief operator finally re
linquished as hopeless his endeavor to
"raise" Suey Fat and turned to Chung
Fow and said:
"No dam usee. 'Phlonee bloke. Go
'way." T . ,
. Chung Fow did not go away, but
demanded restoration of the cash Â» he
had deposited in the corporation's
boxes, also pecuniary compensation
for his loss of time and temper. He
was laughed to scorn, and then he
plucked a telephone from its fasten
ings and hurled It through a window.

TWO POLICHMEN
CONFESS GUILT
Admit They Accepted Money
From Chinese Games and
Arrests May Follow Soon
GEAND JUKOES BALKED
Revelations Looked For Xot;
Forthcoming â Chan Che
ung Spirited From Home
The police committee of the Grand
Jury. had a conference last evening to
consider future plans for investigation
of the charges of corruption in China
town. They are working quietly and
may bring matters to a head by caus
ing arrests to-day.
Two policemen, Henry Heinz and R.
R. O'Brien, have admitted to the com
mittee that money was given them by
the agents of gambling games in
Chinatown. The Chinese are very in
sistent that patrolmen shall accept
gifts of cash in order to feel more as
sured that their unlawful â¢ operations
shall not be molested, and Heinz and
O'Brien were ' induced to take the
money. The contributions they re
ceived are believed to have come from
the collections of. $5 per table that were
made from the tan games. *
Further than these admissions of the
two policemen the committee has
gathered no important evidence.
Heinz and O'Brien implicated no
other policemen. They asserted
positively ,1rhat they were not
in league with any one. They testi
fied that they received no secret in
structions from Chief Wittman or from
Sergeant Ellis, who was immediately
in command of them, not to disturb
the games. The only Instructions they
knew of were those issued in written
form by the Chief. ;-â .,-/>
Every ether member of the China
town squad called before the commit
tee denied that he had ever accepted
a cent from the Chinese gamblers. Not
a bit of incriminating information was
gleaned from them. It transpires that
the information Sergeant Ellis gave
the Grand Jurors was of a vague char
acter, but in following it up the ad
missions were obtained from Heinz
and O'Brien.
Having definite evidence that money
is paid to policemen in Chinatown the
members of the committee hoped that
this would give them a lead to much
bigger revelations. Progress has been
very slow thus far, however. ,
Monday night Foreman Andrews and
his colleague, E. J. Rowes, proceeded
to Chinatown quietly and took Chan
Cheung, a well-to-do merchant, into
custody. They kept him in hiding all
day* yesterday and refused to divulge
his whereabouts to his frantic wife.
Chan Cheung's attorney, Frank V.
Bell, threatened habeas corpus pro
ceedings, but Foreman Andrews asked
him not to do anything till this morn
ins at 11 o'clock. The Chinaman is
supposed to have given the bribes to
the police. <
ELLIS NOT READY TO REPLY.
Says He Is Instructed by Grand Jury
Not to Answer Htitton'.s Charge.
Police Sergeant Thomas Ellis was
summoned before the Police Commis
sioners last night to answer" to the
charge preferred . by Commissioner
Hutton, that on the night of Novem
ber 19 Ellis notified certain Chinese,
gamblers that Hutton was to make a
visit to Chinatown on the 28th.
Ellis asked for a continuance on
the ground that the Grand Jury had
instructed him to make no answer to

this Hutton exclaimed, 'â¢Well, I'm
ready to go ahead with the' case."
Ellis replied that he had no attorney
to represent him and that Bowes and
Andrews of the Grand Jury and "Dis
trict Attorney Byington had instruct
ed him not to talk. Ellis was granted
a continuance of one week.
The. cases of Sergeants Fraher and
Brophy and Patrolmen Doran, Heinz,
O'Brien, McGrath and Munn, who are

he was ready to proceed, but changed
his mind when the counsel for Ser^

were ready to answer the charges.
Police Captain Duke submitted a

street and Grant avenue, showing that

sion reported that the petition for.
a renewal of the license would be con*
sidered provided the doors were re*

censes exoire in a short while.
Among them are the Bay State, New-

Thirteen retail liquor dealers in the
Italian quarter were refused permis
sion to hang' curtains before the

Germain Charged With Perjury.
Benjamin F. Germain, confessed
bigamist, will have to answer to a
charge of perjury. He pleaded guilty
in Judge Dunne's court a few days
ago to a charge of bigamy and was
sentenced to serve two and a half
yearp in > San Quentin. Yesterday Vir
ginia H. Barker of Santa Barbara,
who was married to Germain in this
