CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo., June 8.â
It was reported before the special
train left for Victor at* 2 o'clock this
afternoon, bearing the force under un
der General Bell, that the miners in
the hills about Dunnville numbered
250 men and that- it was their inten
tion to march into Victor to-night in
a body and make an attempt to liber

porary bullpen in Victor. That the
force actually consisted of but twenty
one men is the statement of one of
the number that was takencaptive.
The train proceeded to the imme
diate vicinity of Dunnville without un
usual incident. When about a quarter
of a mile distant from the Dunnville
temporary station' the officers could
see the camp of the miners. It,in
cluded one cabin and six or seven
tents. The officers left the train at
the command of General Bell and pre

the unionists: in regular skirmish or

Epecial Dispatch to The Call
Shortly after the news reached the
city by telephone a colored soldier,
greatly excited, rushed into the Occi
dental Hotel and hurriedly asked the
clerk for the address of Mrs. Edith
The beautiful flat at 1004 McAllister
street was deserted last night, save for
the presence of Mrs. Muir, the mother
of Mrs. Pittman. Mrs. Muir was ter
ribly shocked when she learned of the
death of Captain Wild, and at first re
fused to believe that he could have
taken his life. She said her daughter
had brought his picture to her while
she was living in Canada and asked
her what she thought of him. Mrs.
Muir replied that while she liked his
appearance as a man, she did not think
he tvould make a good husband. He
looked too severe. Mrs. Muir said Mrs.
Plttman was in Oakland and would not
be home until some time to-day.
The last seen of Captain Wild by his
army friends in this city was shortly
before midnight Wednesday, when in
company with a number of other offi
cers he was enjoying the Jinks that fol
lowed the meeting of the Military
Order of the Carabao at the Occidental
Hotel. If he was contemplating suicide
then his manner did not in any way
suggest the fact to his friends, who left
the hotel with him when the meeting
adjourned. On Montgomery street the
captain bade them good-n!ght and in
dicated that he purposed to return to
the island. This he evidently did some
time before morning. The first intima
tion his friends on this side of the bay
received of his death was late yester
day afternoon, when a telephone mes-"
sage from the island conveyed the in
formation that his body had been dis
covered, with a pistol lying by its side.
SOLDIER WITH MESSAGE.
A grand piano, a pianola, gorgeous
tapestries and everything that the en
vironment of wealth could give decor
ates the dainty flat. Some months
ago It Is reported that the captain
commenced to feel that he could not
keep up the strain and often in the
presence of his friends in the Bohe
mian Club he was wont to assert that
without money a man should not live.
While he assumed a Jovial air at the
club, it was apparent to all his friends,
and they were legion, that he was la
boring under a mental strain.
MRS. PITTMAN ABSENT.
Captain Wild's death has caused a
great sensation in army circles. From
what can be learned and from report*
undoubtedly authentic, it appears in
a direct way that a woman was at
the bottom and the cause of his
death. . Wh en Captain Wild came
home from the Philippines two years
ago he brought with him $4000.
Shortly after his arrival here he be
came acquainted with Mrs. Evelyn
Plttman. From that time until now
she has resided In a luxurious flat at
1004 McAllister street- Every acces
sory that elegance and refinement
could suggest Is there.
CAUSES SENSATION.
The body of Captain Wild was part
ly dressed,, plainly suggesting that he
had not retired during the night, and
facts later developed would support
thuÂ» theory. An examination of the
body revealed a wound in the chest,
where the bullet from his army re
volver had entered and penetrated his
heart.
Captain Frederick S. Wild, commis
sary officer of the Thirteenth U. S. In
fantry, ended his life some time after
5 o'clock yesterday morning in his

by a private soldier about 3 o'clock and
a few minutes later a pistol shot was
heard, but as these reports are fre
quently heard on the island no par

the day, between the hours of 12 and 1.

occasion to enter the officer's apart

Captain Wild was a native of New
York State, 41 years of age and un
married. He entered the army as a
private soldier In 1887, and ten years
later he was appointed from the ranks
to the position of first lieutenant. In
1S99 be was made a captain and was
eent to the Philippines with the Thir
teenth Infantry. He returned here
about two years ago, and later
was assigned to duty as regi
mental commissary at Fort McDowell,
Angel Island. Among the army folk
he was a very popular officer, and his
tragic death. was the last thing expect
ed by his many friends at the various
posts.
ROSE FROM THE RANKS.
Through the long hours of last
night, while a solitary soldier stood si-
Jently. by the bier of the dead officer
on Angel Island, the hastily penciled
note addressed by* Major Wild to Mrs.
Madden lay upon the table In her
apartments . at the Cumberland, on
Bush street, awaiting the return of the
woman, who, rumor said, had departed
earlier in the day on an automobile
Tide to Ban Jose. ;"' .â¢'.;â.
i It was said at the Cumberland last
night that she would return to-day.
Not until then will the last message of
Wild be known and then probably onjy
to the woman, who will share the se
crecy of Its contents with the dead.
Wild for many months entertained
an Infatuation for Mrs. Madden, a fact
that was no secret to many of his
friends. . He had often Visited her at
the Occidental Hotel and showered
upon her many attentions that did not
pass unnoticed by those that were
acquainted with the couple.
When her husband recently insti
tuted divorce proceedings against her
and involved the name of. Captain
Roblchon In his complaint. Captain
Wild suddenly appeared as Robichon'a
sponsor and later became the latter's
attorney before the court-martial that
convicted Robichon of conduct unbe
coming an officer. The conviction re
sulted in Robichon's dismissal from
the army.
May Madden, whose husband. Captain
John Madden, is now suing her for
divorce. The colored man said he had
just arrived from Angel Island and
told of, the suicide of Captain Wild,
who, he said, had intrusted to him a
note for Mrs. Madden Just before the
captain had gone to his quarters early
that morning. When Mrs. Madden's
address was given the messenger he
hurried off to deliver the note, but it
was learned Mrs. Madden was not at
home.

The Hodson strike was in progress
during a portion of their stay and one
of them was particularly vindictive
against the non-unionists, saying that
if he had his' way he would blow them
up. There were many conferences be

They paid their, bills, promptly and
seemed to have plenty of money. One
of them left the house in March and
told the landlady that he had a letter
from Denver summoning him there for

later engaged rooms in the lodging
house there and took their trunks and

remarks. They told her they were
miners -and used the explosives in
their business. On another occasion
she saw-a lot of fulminating caps. Her

Allison, who is a very powerful fel

made another dash for liberty. Dep
uty Sheriff Downey, who was armed,
happened along at that juncture and.
drawing a revolver on Allison,
marched him back to prison.
Marshall is awaiting trial on the
charge of attempted murder. He es
caped from prison several years ago,
went to Montana, killed a woman,
served five years and was brought

term. Allison Is about to serve twen
ty-four years for holding up a saloon.
It is supposed he is one of the men
who murdered Policeman Schenaman.
Marshall ran Into the Jailer's office,
where Deputy Sheriff Hogan was ly
ing on a couch. Hogan felled Mar
shall with a blow on the chin and
then pushed him into a cell usad for
special occasions yid slammed the
door. Allison, who came behind, at
tacked Hogan with a razor, and four
trusties went to the assistance of the
deputy. One of the trusties held Mar
shall in the cell while the fight was In
progress. Allison finally forced his
way through the trusties and ran into
the kitchen, where he knocked down
Deputy Hippe, who had gone to close
the outer door. According to the rules
of the prison, Hippe was unarmed.
When Allison ran out of the door into
the street Hippe gave chase. Picking
up a piece of rock he threw it at Al

stunned him for a moment. When
Allison recovered his senses Hippe was
on top of. him.

Marshall and Allison sawed the bars
of the. steel cage in which they wer*
confined and when Deputy Sheriff
Hippe was superintending the removal
of garbage from the cage to the kitch

without much trouble, as her skirts,
forming a buoy, kept her afloat.
Miss Colloway heard that her sweet
heart was to be married at 8 o'clock
'n the evening. She bought an alarm
clock, and a short time before that she
went to the dock, carefully set the
â¢.lock and sat down to wait tilf the

CHICAGO, June S.â James Cantant
of Melrose Park is searching for his
wife, his two little girls and his sav
ings, amounting to J1000., He declares
that Charles Yuknewich is responsible
for the disappearance of "wife, children
and money. He believeg they have
gone to San Francisco and the local
police have asked the California au
thorities to look out for them.
. "I am particularly desirous of find
ing the children and the $1000. As for
the others, I am not so particular,"
said Cantant, when he told" of the dis-"
appearance to the police.
According to Cantant, Yuknewich
went to Melrose Park some weeks ago
and. ehortly after his arrival, became
acquainted with Cantant's wife. The
man called at his house many times,
but he had not the slightest idea that
his wife had formed an attachment for
Yuknewich. The news was first bro
ken to him when he hied to his home
yesterday at noon and found no lunch
eon i prepared. Me then searched the
house for his wife and children, but
they*were missing. His hunt for the
money was as fruitless as was his
search for his family. He Immediately
told the police of the disappearance.
The children are girls and are 3 and
5 years old.

ST. PETERSBURG. June 8.â The
reports of the sorties from and at
tacks on Port Arthur coming In from
foreign sources arouse the liveliest
interest here. The general staff is be
coming more reticent and the public
is convinced that an important battle,
which may decide the fate of the cam
paign, is impending. The outpost en
gagements between the main armies
of Generals Kuropatkin and Kuroki
have suddenly ceased. Such a lull fre
quently occurs after two armies have
been for some- time in touch and just
before they are ready to strike. Ku
roki has not yet moved, according to
the latest advices, but is drawing in
his skirmishers, as if preparing to do
so. Kuropatkin has elaborately forti
fied his position at Liaoyang.
Kuropatkln and Kuroki Soon to Meet
. In Decisive Combat.
GREAT BATTLE IS XEARIXG.
No attention is paid in London to re
mors that the storming of the fort
resses has already begun, because It Is
known that at the battle of Klnchou
General Oku had exausted his ammu
nition and an insufficient period has
elapsed duftng which the stores of am
munition pould be renewed and siege
guns brought into position. It is con
sidered likely that Admiral Togo is not
averse to Port Arthur wasting its am
munition in constant encounters with
the gunboats. This may explain the
rumored bombardments^ while the fir
ing on the land side may be due to pre
liminary operations having for their
purpose driving In the Russian forces.
X.ONDON, June 8.â The sudden in
terruption of the cable between Korea
and Japan is considered significant of
the imminence of important operations
at Port Arthur, the Japanese having
taken precautions, as usual, to 'cut the
means of communication with the out
side world and thus enable their naval
and military forces to work with ab
solute secrecy.
Two regiments of Ural Cossacks, the
pride and hppe of the Russian cavalry,
have been ordered to the front.
-Transports, twenty-five in number,
with full munitions and store, are
awaiting the clearance, of mines from
TaUenwan. Â¦
Here military critics are thoroughly
nonplused at the situation and all
agree that no immediate move will be
made toward the rescue of Port Ar
thur and that the Japaneese retreat is
in the nature of a feint.
ST. PETERSBURG, June 8. â The
only news received to-day was that of
an, engagement at Wafandlen, the Jap
anese having 320 killed. They re
tired to Tsienchu, apparently believ
ing the Russians were advancing in
force. ';'-".
Special Cable to The Call and Xew York Her

ST. PETERSBURG.- June 8. â Over
and over agrain I have- heard anger
and ridicule expressed at the fantastic
reports sent from here suggesting that
General Kuropatkin'was being forced
Into a plan of campaign against his
judgment. On all sides these are de
scribed as totally untrue and invented
by those who wish to throw discredit
upon Russia.
A thousand carts are being em
ployed in removing stores from Xew
chwang to a point behind Mukden.
When this is completed he will deliver
a crushing blow to the enemy.
At one moment he contemplated
sacrificing Newchwang, but the value
of the war material there and the
shortage of the same at his head
quarters owing to the amount rushed
into Port Arthur at the last moment
made it of vital importance to hold
the place until the stores were saved.
This will explain much of Kuropat
kin's tactics that have hitherto been
somewhat inexplicable.
Kuroki's advance forces have made
several attempts to creep around the
Russian flank, but have been invari
ably repelled by the Cossacks. Simul
taneously cruisers and gunboats have
been bombarding the Kwantung coast.

n*u>hew. Both the men had the proper papers,
signed by Honolulu officials, which entitled
thorn to land, but ths lady had no papors
such as are required by law. or any papers
at all. In such matters the law leaves the
official without an}' discretion, and it dbes not
exempt any persons of the Chinese race from
Its requirements, no matter whether they are
married to Americans or not. The momeiV
that the steamship company notifies us that
Chinese or descendants of Chinese are on
board it la our duty to stop them until they
prove that they -are entitled to land. If we
did not do It we would be liable to prosecution.
Every courtesy was shown the lady and her
statement was taken, as required by the law.
I found her to be a lady or refinement and
culture.
The lady arrived with Toney C.
Afong and Chun Wing Sen Afong, her
brother and nephew, who came from.
Shanghai by the steamship Siberia
and stopped over at Honolulu to ac
company their sister hither. Dr. John
Endicott Gardiner, a Chinese inspec
tor, was at the gangplank and stopped
the party. The brother and nephew
exhibited papers, signed by the proper
officials at Honolulu, certifying that
they were American citizens under the
act annexing Hawaif to the United
States. Immediately upon the produc
tion of. the papers they were allowed
to land. Mrs. Carrie Riggs, however,
had no papers and Dr. Gardiner, who
is one of the most courteous officials
in the Federal service, informed her
that under the law and his instruc
tions he had no discretion, but would
have to report her arrival to his su
perior officer..
Mrs. Riggs was inclined to be in
dignant, but after the situation had
been . explained, she acknowledged
that, unpleasant as the episode had
proved to her, the inspector was sim r
ply doing his duty and in the least of
fensive way possible. Dr. Gardiner at
once communicated with Charles Me
han. Inspector in charge of the Chi
nese bureau, and Mr. Mehan directed
that the usual statement should be
taken from her as to her identity, age,
birthplace, etc. This was done and
when Immigrant Commissioner North
arrived at his office shortly after 9
a. m. Mr. Mehan laid the facts before
him, whereupon the Commissioner or?
dered that she be landed without fur
ther ceremony. An inspector was sent
to the steamer with the order and the
lady was released at once. /The steam
er arrived at the wharf at 7:45 a. m.
and Mrs. Riggs went ashore at
10:46 a. m.
Dr. Gardiner made the following
statement regarding the affair:
lire. Carrie Riggs, a young and
talented member of the Afong family,
was detained for three hours on board
the steamship Coptic yesterday-fore
noon by the exigencies of the Chinese
exclusion act.

The State Department has received
unofficial assurances through Gum

will accede to all of Raissoull's terms.

The Sultan in his letter appoints
Herid El Barrada to be Governor of
â¢ Tangier, which step was included
! among Ralssouli's demands. Barrada
was a member of the. Council of Mo
hammed El Torres, the representative
of the Sultan here, and formerly was
Governor of Masagan.
The authorities here assert that the
raid made yesterday by armed Anjera
tribesmen on the home of an English
man here, during which they obtained
Beveral rifles, was'onlya common rob
bery and had no political significance.
matic representations made in regard
to the kidnaping of Perdicaris and Var
ley arrived here this atternoon. It is
said by a person in the Sultan's con
fidence that the' Sultan has given or
ders to grant all of the conditions de
manded by Raissouli, the bandit leader,
in order to expedite the release of the
captives.
It is definitely learned that but $10
was secured in the hold-up. . This is
nccounted for by the fact that only
small sums of money are ever carried
by the train that was robbed.
! The scene, of the robbery was but
| 600 yards from the flow of the Grand
' River and it is believed that the rob
; bers had a boat hidden in the Grand
! and that they used this to cross the
â¢ river, destroying it after they had
j crossed.
J A posse under Deputy Sheriff Cohn
J of Grand Junction followed the course
< of the river until they reached Rifle,
'i There they discovered the trail of the
(robbers, indications showing that they
. v must have passed the point but a few
I hours before. It is believed that the
( bandits are heading for the "Hole-in
the-Wall" country in Wyoming.
Just at this point Brakeman Shel
lenbarger, who had been ordered to
remain with the passenger coaches,
two miles behind, came running up
the track, carrying a lantern. One
of the robbers shot at him. He was
wounded in the leg and is now in the
Sisters' Hospital at Grand Junction.
When the robbers saw that the train
crew was coming' they fled to the
mountains. One of them as he Jumped
from the express car grabbed one
sealed bag, which had been blown
clear out of the safe. This was the
only plunder which was taken.
The engineer and the others who
had been under the aim of the rob
bers went to the aid of Shellenbarger,
who had fallen where he was shot.
After the hold-up the engine, bag
gage and express cars were backed to
Parachute, where the alarm was given
to the railroad officials.

for they did not even demand of the
messenger to open the safe. They
knew that he did not have the com
bination. This safe can be opened
only in Denver and In Salt Lake.
A stick of dynamite was placed
against the lock of the safe. Here
again the robbers showed their disre
gard of dynamite. One^half of thÂ«
explosive used would have done the
work.

Although Grand Jury subpenaes
had be^n issued for J. Morgan Smith
<*nd other witnesses. District Attorney
Jerome said that the case of "Nan"
Patterson would not be taken up by
thÂ»Â» Grand Jury at this time.
Justice Clarke of the Supreme Court
to-day denied the writ of habeas cor
pus for the release of "Nan" Patterson,

on. Nominally she is held as a wit
ness under 55000 bail, but District At
torney Jerome has intended that, in
case of her release, either on bail or
by any other means, she will be re
arrested;
The case took a new turn to-day
when Algernon Meyer of Jacksonville,
Fla.. publicly announced that he was
a witness to the killing of Young and
stated that Young himself held the re
volver which fired the fatal shot. Mey
rr went to the District Attorney's of
fice and said he desired to make a for
mal statement in regard to the case.
Meyer met District Attorney Jerome
end Assistant District Attorney Rand
and was subjected to an extended ex
amination. His statement was taken
In full by an official stenographer.
MEYER'S STORY OF TRAGEDY.
According to Meyer, who says he
witnessed the scene, 'the shooting of
Young appeared to be accidental. Mrs.
Patterson was struggling with Young,
who had a revolver in his right hand
and his right arm was around her
neck. To Meyer it appeared as though
Mrs. Patterson was trying to push
Young away from her. or, perhaps, to
take the revolver away from him.
According to the policeman who first
reached the cab Mrs. Patterson sat at
th<* left of Young.
Meyer says there was another wit
ness to the tragedy. This was a man
fibout five fert eight inches tall, at
tirM In a dark suit Â«nd wearing a
etraw hat. He hid a small black mus
tache. This ijian. who was directly
opposite the <ab wlie n the pistol was
iired. according to the story told by
Meyer, jumped up on the step of the
cab and rode - short distance. Meyer
fays he believes the man talked to the
woman in the cab.
About this witness all manner of
mystery is thrown. Assistant District
Attorney Gaivan has had him closely
v. atehed by Detective Sergeant Price,
refusing to permit him To talk with
Any one. Notwithstanding the imporr
ance which is attached to his tes
timony, he has not boen subpenaed to
appear brfore the Grand Jury to-mor
row, but is being held in reserve by the
prosecution. Gaivan permitted it to be
understood that this witness is named
H. A. Katz. The directory docs not
disclose the identity of Katz.
Ancthtr eye witness to the shooting
has been found by the District Attor
ney in Carl Norlander. who has been
pervert with a subpoena. Norlander, it
is said, is now in the house of deten
tion, held as a witness. His testimony,
it is expected, will shatter the story
told by Mre. Patterson that Young
phot himself. Norlander was near the
cab when the shooting took place. He
Is supposed to be the pedestrian who
leaped upon >the step of the carriage
just after the shooting, according to
the witness Meyer.

OAKLAND, June S. â Social activity in the.
Oakland Club received a fresh impetus to-day
at the hou.vwarmins luncheon, and life In the
new and commodious headquarters began most
auspiciously. Maple Hall is vastly more con

both as to situation and space, and the club
wjll undoubtedly grew more rapidly than it
has in the past.
Â¦ As is unual when men or women get together
on eurh an ccasioi.," there waa murh speech
making, and, an beats a working club, to-day's
topics were mostly serious and handled in a

Whatever else Mrs. Hearst does, she
will not withdraw her support from
the anthropological department that
she has so liberally patronized. A
persistent rumor that Mrs. Hearst con
templated letting that branch of the
university's activities shift for itself
was denied to-day by Edward Clark,
manager of Mra. Hearst's business af
fairs, who defends his employer's re
cent act'on in refusing to give further
aid to some of. the benefactions she
founded.
Mrs. Hearst, so Mr. Clark says, will
continue to sive her support to the
anthropological department. Her
gifts to assist the work of searching
for the hidden relics of past ages have
amounted to at least $50,000 a year
for several vears. Her agents have
delved beneath the earth and among
the archives of foreign lands until
now . the University of California
boasts of one of the most vamable
collections in the world.
"Mrs. Hearat will continue to sup
port the archaeological department,"
said Manager Clark at his office in
San Francisco th,is morning. "It ia
true that the contracts with some of
the scientific men ! engaged to carry
on researches will soon expire and
probably will not be renewed. But
the work these men set out to tdo is
about completed and there is no fur
ther need for their services. . Her con
tract with Professor Otto Emerson, for
instance, will expire in "September.
Under Professor Emerson's direction
Mrs. Hearst has spent $30,000 this
last year upon Greek and Egyptian
researches alone. Sh'e has also sup
ported the work of Professor F. \V.
Putnam in America and Professor
Max Uhle in Peru, which have cost
great sums of money.
"It 'seems to me unkind to talk
about Mrs. Hearst withdrawing her
benefactions. I think I can say that
she does not intend to withdraw her
patronage of the university at all. She
has simply cut down on a few things
that did not justify continued expendi
tures of money.- The few she has
abandoned are nothing compared to
the many she is still assisting."

Whether the salaries of the thirty
or forty employes on the infirmary
pay roll can be paid out of the money
now remaining in the fund or at all Is
a question that is Interesting them.
Statutory fees can be paid out of any
available money or can be carried
over into next year, but the wages in
question are not provided _for by stat
ute and if the present month slips
through without their being paid it is
questionable whether they will be
paid at all. The money remaining in
the fund could be used for this pur
pose, but there are outstanding
against this fund bills long overdue,
which were on file before the salaries
accrued and it is believed they must
take precedence in the order of filing.
The butcher and baker, grocer and
coal man have large accounts and the
banks have refused to discount their
claims. The clanu r for money is be
ing heard throughout political circles
and wherever inttuence can be brought
to bear upon the Supervisors to pass
claims. The Grand Jury is still in ses
sion and Ls hampering the movements
of the board. It is believed that as
soon as this official body is out of ex
istence the Supervisors will take some
action looking to the relief of the sit
uation.

The County Infirmary pay roll has
been suspended and no bills have been'
allowed against this fund since May
9. The employes of the County In- |
firmary and Receiving Hospital have
not received their May salaries. The
question is asked how far the Bhortage
will extend. There Is at present to the ,
credit of the infirmary fund the sum
of $4471 58. Against this there are
bills now on file aggregating about
$1.4,000 and a month yet to run be
fore the next year's' money will be
available.
County Assessor Henry P. Dalton
must pay Alameda County ?1999 which
he collected from the city of Oakland
for furnishing the assessment rolls to
the city. In a decision handed down
to-day Judge Melvin decides that Dal
ton has no right to the money. Dalton
charged the city of Oakland $2650 for
preparing the assessment rolls. Of this
amount Judge Melvin found 5651 to be
actual expenses, and that the balance
should have been turned Into the
county treasury.
On the trial of the 'county's suit
against Dalton he claimed he had em
ployed II. H. Miller, one of his deputies,
to do the work and .promised him 5
cents a folio, this being/the amount the
city was willing to pay. Thirteen men
finished the work in ten days and but
two of them were paid, the others testl
fj'ing they never expected anything for
their services.
Judge Melvin said:
The Assessor is required to file with the Au
ditnr "a Â»worn statement showing the persons
to whom the amounts paid to each â¢ â¢ â¢ for
such aspe?Ement rolls." The very purpose of i
requiririK the sworn statement In, detail must
have been the furnishing of data which would
enable those Interested In the matter to deter
mine whether or not the Assessor had re
tained enly the actual cost of the work. There
fore It is clear that the contract with Mr.
Miller was void. That contract being of no
?"fleet, ttie Assessor must pay to the county the
difference between $2650 and the actual cost of
the work. It eeems frcra all the evidence that
a fair estimate of the value of their services,
countlnK overtime, for the days during which i
they worked upon the city's rolls, is $50 for
each man. or aii amount equal to the value of
fifteen days of the ordinary service of these
same men when working the usual number of
hours per day for the Assessor. It make rlo
difference that these men had afrreed to work
for Mr. Miller, their fellow employe, for less
money or for nothing or without any arrange
ment as to compensation. Whatever their re
lations with Mr. Miller might have been, which {
Induced them to reduce or waive comreneatlcn j
when working for him. these relations would
have no bearing upon their claim against fhe
Assessor for the reasonable value of their la
"bor.
From the foregoing it follows that plaintiff
should have judgment for the difference be
tween J2<2Â»'J and $C5l. that Is to say, for the
sum of $l't'.<ft, together with the costs of suit.
This is the third suit of the same
sort decided . against Dalton, and he
now has $2800 Just collected from th<;
city for the last assessment rolls which
will al*o be the subject of a suit.

William S. Kennedy, who was shot
by William O. Stewart at the Brings
ranch, near Alvarado, has made a
statement of the affray to Deputy
Sheriff J. H. Reilly, who was sent to
the raucJi by Sheriff Bishop. Ken
nedy denies Stewart's claim that he
< Kennedy) tried to stab Stewart. The
wounded man insists that he was shot
while trying to BavÂ« his young wife
from being killed.
It is a queer tale that Kennedy nar
rates. He declares that he became
natisfied that his wife, Edith, had be
eome enamored of Stewart when the
three lived at San Bernardino. Fol
lowing along his narrative. Kennedy
told Deputy Reilly that he invited
Stewart after meeting him in San
Francisco to go to the Briggs place,
and there, in Kennedy's hearing, ask
the woman whom she loved best.
"We went to the ranch," said Ken
nedy, "and Stewart called my wife out.
while I hid in some brush. Stewart
asked my wife to go with him and she
refused, starting back into the house
and declaring she would stay with me.
"With that Stewart pulled out a
pistol and commenced shooting. I
jumped out to my wife's rescue and
that was when I was shot. Stewart
ran away as I fell to thÂ« ground."
Kennedy declared he had left San
Bernardino with his wife In order to
get away from Stewart, but the man
had followed them to San Francisco.
The wounded man is in a critical con
dition. Stewart teas brought back
from San Jose to-day.

Each year S. N. Wood &. Co. have been com
pelled to make extensive alterations to ac
commodate their fast'growlng trade. A few
days ago they leased the store .next to them
at 742 Market. This will give a great deal more
space for window display and provide sales
floor of considerable width and depth.- The
hat department will move into the new store,
thus having more room and better facilities.
The clothing department will be extended by
occupying the space formerly devoted to hats.
A. L. Peyser, the manager of S. N*. Wood &.
Co., when asked to what he attributed the
rapid growth of his firm, said:
"People will buy where they can get the
most for their money. Just as water seeks Its
level, the public will look for and patronize
that store that gives them full value for their
money and treats them with just considera
tion. And that's the whole etory in a nut
shell. I recall Emer6on's word*, for they
apply exactly to our establishment: "If a man
write a better book, preach a better sermon
or maXe a better mousetrap than his neigh
bor, though he build his house in the woods,
the world will make a beaten path to his
door." "
Five years ago when S. N. Wood & Co.
leased the butldlng formerly occupied by tbt
Golden Rule Bazaar many merchants du
biously shook their heads, thinking that the
step was too great. True, it was quite an
undertaking for a clothing firm. But later
developments proved conclusively that the
move was a. good one.

Room Is Secured.

PROGRAMME FOR OUTING
A month ago they reached Constan
tinople. At this time the yourrg ladies
were evidently in a nervous condition
and told stories of an attempt to kid
nap them near the Pyramids and of
their having been pursued across the
Galilee by Bandit Sheik. On the ar
rival of the three sisters in Vienna
their nervousness became more
marked. They dismissed or evaded
the courier and moved from hotel to
hotel, declaring that they were pur
sued by masked men. This went on
for several days until finally the un
fortunate sisters accosted a policeman
on the Rinpstrasse and begged protec
tion. They were immediately taken
in charge and placed in ait asylum.
PARIS. June 8. â Friends of the
Misses Bondy of New York have re
ceived from Vienna news that the
young women are in a medical insti
tution in that city, having been taken
there for observation and treatment
while laboring under great excitement
or hysteria. '.
Six months ago the three young sis
ters left New York for Europe un
attended for a trin to the Mediterra
nean, Egypt and the Holy Land. Well
supplied with both letters of credit
and introduction, they sailed through
the Mediterranean and after visiting
the claFsic lands started for the Holy
I^ands and Syria, not, however, before
they had already had some unpleasant
experiences which- demonstrated that
traveling without a male escort or
chaperon in Eastern countries is
<juite different thing from what It
is in America.

As an exponent of business and club
life in this city, he Is exceptionally
popular, being accounted rarely good

Â¦ Mr. and Mrs. Williar will spend a few
weeks at Monterey, the Elysium of the
newly wed, and returning will take
up their abode in Mr. Williar's pictur
esque home on the hillside of Sausalito.
The season of 1904 has been replete
with smart weddings, but it remained
for the Huntsman-Willlar nuptials at
high noon yesterday to set the standard
of quiet elegance and delicacy of detail.
The ceremony uniting Miss Genevieve
Louise Huntsman and Harry R. Williar
Â¦was performed by the Rev. Dr. Clam
pett at the home of the bride, whtah
had been decorated with a profuslorr of
Hewers and ferns.
The bride, a statesque maid of superb
coloring, wore a white chiffon cloth
gown, hand made and 'trimmed with
rare old lace. She was attended by her
sister, Mrs. Kindleberger, as matron of
honor, and was given into the keeping
of the groom by her mother, Mrs.
George Huntsman.
Mr. Williar comes from an old Baltl
morean family of high repute, members
of which for a century have attained
distinction in professional and social
affairs.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: A year and
three months ago I was attacked with that
terrible disease, locomotor ataxia. Power to
balance, stand, or even sit down, entirely lost.
Two best doctors of San Francisco and Hot
Springs. Ark., failed to help me. My stom-
ach, bowels and kidneys failed to work. I had |
catarrh of stomach, head and bladder as a re- j
suit of the disease; these troubles becamo,
chronic. At times my heart would beat like a j
drum, my eyes grew weak, my memory bad. ,
my nerves wrtcked. Three months ago I went
to Tuscan Springs. What happened since was J
a pleasant surprise to me. Drank the waters, .
took the baths â after three weeks' treatment Â¦
stomach, bowels, bladder and kidneys In per- |
feet condition, eyesight perfect, nervousness >
gone, memory good. After three months' treat-
ment, .walked without a cane, with eyes closed
and up and down steep hills; am cured of this
dread disease, now walk with slight limp.
Have run stores in seventeen towns of the
State of Calitornia; am well known In down-
town districts of San Francisco; inquiry there
will prove truth of my helpless condition three
months ago. Further Information, address

TO ADJOURN CONGRESSâ Read
er, City. The power of the President
to adjourn Congress is found in article
ill, section 3 of the constitution, which
reads as follows: "He (the President)
shall from time to time give to dbn
gress information of the state of the
Union and recommend to their con
sideration such measures as he shall
judge necessary and expedient; he
may, on extraordinary occasions, con
vene both houses or either of them,
and. in case of disagreement between
them, with respect to the time of ad
journment, he may. adjourn them to
such time as he shall think proper."
THE Grand Jury, which was discharged on Monday
after five months of continuous work hi the inter
ests of the city, embodied in. its final report some
suggestions and counsel on matters pertaining to muni
cipal affairs that are deserving of marked attention.
Particularly instructive and suggestive of possible appli
cation are the projects, , {herein set forth, which have to
do with the establishment of a salt water supply to be
used as an auxiliary system in case of dangerous fires
and for sewer. flushing and street cleaning at all times!
"The need of . an auxiliary v salt water system for the
city is highly apparent," reads, the report of the Grand
Jury, "and immediate provision should be made for the
installation of this improvement. . The storage/ system'
recommended by the Board of Fire Commissioners, with
a reservoir at Twin Peaks, seems to be the most practical

Vegetable Caterpillars.
The so-called vegetable caterpillar of
New Zealand is attracting much atten
tion at present, says Nature, of Lon
don. Fungoid parasites are common in
all parts of the world, but not gener
ally conspicuous enough to be noticed
by any but naturalists. Many of the
largest apd most remarkable moths of
'the Australian region are known to be
Infested .by various parasite fungi,
which convert the whole substance of
the caterpillar into a woody substance
and then sprout from it to the height
of several inches. The caterpillars
(which are usually about four inches
long when fully grown) live until they
are ready to asume the pupa state,
when they bury themselves in the
ground, .die,, and the fungus * sprouts
upward,' generally from the neck of
the caterpillar, sometimes acquiring a
length of- nearly a foot, and sprouting
up from the' ground above the cater
pillar. Very rarely two or even three
of these filaments may sprout from a
single caterpillar. The New Zealander's
names for . this plant-caterpillar are
hotete and acuhe. ' The natives eat the
plants, which, ' when fresn, have the
flavor of a out, and also use them,
when /burnt, as coloring matter for
their tattooing, rubbing the- powder
Into the wounds, in which state It has
a strong animal smell. .
Ansivers to Queries.
' TOBACCOâ A. G. V. City. The yield
of tobacco In the Unltea States, ac
cording to the latest figures furnished

821.823,363 pounds during the year

THE great seal of the State of Oregon bears as its
sole legend "The Union." At the , time of the"a"d
, mission of Oregon as a State the bonds of the
Union had^een weakened in partisan controversy and
the paramount allegiance of millions of our countrymen
was unsettled. Oregpn, of her own act, set upon her
seal her great purpose to abide by the Union. Her voice
was uttered by her great Senator Baker and from her
position taken in that time of testing and trial she has
not swerved. Her election is'the first one of the year,
and she records her verdict for .the side represented by
Baker and Williams and stands steadfastly by the Re
publican party and President Roosevelt. " â¢
, The majority is sfgnificantly large.. Oregon is typical
of the -treat West. Within -her borders are nearly all
the industries that are peculiar to the country between
the -Pacific and the Missouri Valley. Her material inter
ests are common to all that territory, and the genius of
her people is kin to that' of the other twelve States in the
Western group. ".The political preference of her- people
is dictated by motives common to them all, and the re
sult of her election May be taken as an indication of
public sentiment in tnem all. The drift of the country
is Republican. Oregon votes first. Vermont and Maine
come next, and evidence of that drift will be as plain in
the result in the East as it is in the West.
The people see no reason for- a change now. No one
pretends that one party. must rule all the time, but the
people know. what the Republican party stands for. The
Democratic party'does not itself know what it stands
for or what it will do to get power. Even Democrats
who will .support their party again when it gets out. of
the insane asylum and ceases to see spooks and hide
from imaginary pursuers are' this year for Roosevelt and
the sane and vigorous Americanism for which he stands.
The votes of \uch Democrats ' have.. gone to ! swell the
Oregon majority and will be given to the same cause in
every- Northern ; State. .; :-. ... V .'Â¦ -. . ,-..

to Esopus, in the State of New York,
for the purpose of writing at close
range a character sketch of Judge Al
ton B. Parker, the overeager but silent
candidate for the Presidential nom
ination on the Democratic ticket.
The result of his observation waa
given in a recent number of a Wash
ington publication. In the course of
his narrative the writer makes the re
markable statement that the hair on
the back of Judge Parker's hands has
been "burnished a bright gold" by hav
ing eo long been kissed by the sun dur
ing the Judge's extended rambles over
his extensive farm. â¢
Another interesting and Important
statement is m3.de to the effect that
while Judge Parker's , hair and mus
tache are red, whether burnished or
not the author does not say, his eyes
are black.
The gamblers In Washington say
that such a combination as this Is sure
to win and Parker's stock has gone up
accordingly In political betting circles.
Among other things the journalist no
ticed was that the Judge's trousers
were much rumpled, a condition of
things which he ascribed to the candi
date's agility and vigorous movements.
with an only son 7 months old, who
enjoys the distinction of being by a
long way the youngest Marquis in
Great Britain. Blessed as she is with
youth and good looks, prophets of May
fair expect that the Marchioness will
make a second match of " great bril
liancy and say it will not again fake
the form of a wedding between May
tnd December.
She was Miss Gertrude Violet Twin-
Ing of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and an
orphan, when, in December, 1902, she
married the Marquis Â« of Donegal,
whose family motto, it is interesting to
note. Is "Honor follows though un
sought." She was 22 then and he was
verging on fcO. She was reputed to
have a snug little fortune. He was
thort of cash and his Irish estates
were much involved, but he was rich
in title?. In addition to . being the
Marquis of Donegal, he was hereditary
Lord High Admiral of Lough Neagh,
Governor of Carlckfergus Castle, Vls
;ount Chichester and Earl of Belfast,
which made him a lord several times
over. So, despite the disparity of fifty
eight years in their, ages, it was re
garded' as an eminently appropriate
end equable match in aristocratic cir
cles.

Soldiers' Banker.
Tour Uncle Samuel la becoming
quite a banker for the American sol
diers. For the year ended June 30,
1903, there was deposited by soldiers
$1,883,014. and it is understood that
the amount for the fiscal year which
will end the last of this month will
be much larger. The enlisted men of
the United States are allowed to leave
their money in the hands of paymas
ters, taking a certificate for It, and the
Government pays the men Interest at
the rate of 4 per cent a year.
Many soldiers largely increase their
earnings by leaving their money on
.deposit as long as possible, and it
Is really a very good savings bank for
thÂ»m. The year before the Spanish
war the amount deposited was less
than one-third of that deposited in
1903. The enlisted strength of the
army has been increased since then,
and is now about doub'le what it was
before the Spanish war, but the
amount left on deposit is three times
as great as It was when the army was
smaller. Possibly service in the Orient
and the establishment of large post.*
have been conducive to saving on the
part of troops. At all events, officers
of the. War Department look upon the
increase as being an indication of
thriftiness upon the part of the Amer
ican soldiers. On several occasions at
tempts have been made in Congress to
allow officers of the army the same
privilege of leaving their money on
deposit, but such a bill has been de
feated every time. â Washington Post.
MAKK TWAIN PROCEEDED TO
FAN THE COP WITH THE CAB
BAGE Leaf.
stepped Into the California Market and.
going up to a vegetable stall, he pluck
ed a large leaf from a head of cabbage.
When he arrived at the place where
the big. fat policeman was fast asleep
the humorist proceeded to fan him
with the cabbage loaf. This amusing
scene soon attracted a crowd, which
Inside of ten minutes had swelled into
hundreds and California street was
blocked to traffic.
To add to the excitement, some one
had run to the old City Hall and In
formed Captain Douglass that there
had been a robbery at Wells, Fargo &
Co.'s, as the place was surrounded by
armed men. Douglass summoned every
available cop on "his force, which at the
time counted less than a dozen, and
rushed to the place designated. After
brushing the crowd to one side, he en
tered the gateway and there found
.Clemens whirling the cabbage leaf as
though nothing unusual had occurred
about him'. To say that Captain Doug
lass was mortified would be but a mild
expression. The drowsy cop lost , his
star and Clemens enjoyed the joke.
OFFICIAL criticism of the manner in which
dairies have been conducted in San Mateo, San
Francisco and Marin counties has awakened
the men who supply milk to this city to the necessity
for the exercise of a greater degree of cleanliness and
more care in their work. No sane head of a family
would buy impure milk, for by it the lives of himself and
of those who* are his natural care would be endangered.
At the best, if milk that is open to suspicion is used,
there is realization that health. is imperiled unnecessarily
and that a good article is not given in return for good
money.
Little children suffer most, for milk is a great part
of their food. When suspicion concerning the supply is
entertained less milk is consumed and less
is purchased.- The dairyman has therefore an interest
in having the public believe that he is dealing fairly.
The opposite opinion, generally held, is^ certain to in
terfere with dairy income.
There is full appreciation of what popular disfavor
means from the purely .business point of view. The
Marin County Tocsin makes some suggestions for the
benefit* of Marin County dairymen that are applicable
to the methods of all parties concerned as milk pro
ducers rind milk handlers.
The Tocsin combats every statement that matters are
not, on the whole, satisfactory among the dairies. of
Marin, but comes to the conclusion that it is wiser,
admitting that there are some cases for which no excuse
is possible, to have abuses attended to at home. Follow
ing this up, it is recommended that the Marin County
Board of. Supervisors adopt an ordinance regulating not
only the conduct of dairies engaged in the production
and shipping of milk for. the market, but of all others.
A certain standard of cleanliness, including a proper
supply of pure water for the stock, ought to be main
tained by ordinance. - To accomplish this a system of
inspection by some competent person is necessary.
The advantage of having it known, of all the counties
from which milk dromes into San Francisco as an article
of diet, that> proper precautions are enforced locally to
restrict marketing to the product that is fit to be con
sumed, is evident.
The Tocsin says it would be satisfactory to have it
understood that those parties who have brought re
proach upon the dairy industry must reform or go out
of business. The Board of Health of San Francisco
must maintain its^ interest in what is goii?g on relating
to the food supply originating in surrounding counties.
It is the duty of the members of this board to know
all that can- be learned concerning such supply. Vigil
ance ought never to be relaxed. The local authorities
in the neighboring counties have also a duty to perform.
The, sooner responsibility in the premises is understood
and the best possible methods are applied by all duly
qualified persons, the better it will be.

the wind carried his remark to the

see if it had reached the other girl.
Apparently It had not. That young
person was clinging to a strap In total
unconsciousness that she was a sub

At the next corner a festive maiden,
elaborately costumed, entered, and the
first man bounded from his seat, which
the new-comer graciously accepted.
This ,lef t the second man at something;
of a disadvantage. He arose* also and
proffered his place to the girl who had

him coldly.

Mark Twain's Joke.
Before Mark Twain made his name
famous in his first production of "The
Innocents Abroad" he was attached to
the staff of the old Alta California. It
Â¦was while thera that he perpetrated
one of his jokes, which at that time
had no more' significance than that of
an ordinary wag who enjoyed a little
fun at another's expense. But since
Mark has made his name known to the
reading world the joke will bear-re
peating.
It was one of those hot summer flays
that occasionally visit San Francisco
that Mr. Woodward, one of the propri
etors of the Alta, stepped into the ed
itorial room and there found Clemens
drawing on the end of a brier root pipe.
Woodward mopped his brow and when
he cooled down he began to deliver^
himself forcibly.
."I'm disgusted." said Woodward, "at
what I Ju/t saw on the street as I
passed by the carriage way leading
Into Wells, Fargo & Co.'s yard down at
California and Montgomery. Sitting
on a chicken coop, either drunk or
knocked out by the heat of the sun, is

*-[-Â» HERE is much pessimistic talk about corporations
I in this country and their influence in legislation.
A It is all used as water on the wheels of the advo
cates o\f public ownership and operation of public utili
ties. It has been so often said that if the Government
does not assume ownership of the property of corpora
tions the corporations will own the Government that
shallow thinkers have come to assume it to be true.
It is time to call for a bill of particulars. What great
acts of legislation, Federal or State, have the corpora
tions secured that have been of permanent injury to the
people? The beginning of the kind of legislation com
plained of was the Credit Mobilier act of Congress. In
the original Pacific Railroad bill the (j Government re
tained a first mortgage lien upon the bonds which it
issued for the construction of the roads. The Credit Mo-
bilier secured legislation to convert that first lien into a
second mortgage, freeing the credit of the roads so that
they borrowed private 'capital secured by a Hen senior
to that of the Government.
When the roads were finished and the country was
getting the benefit of them this matter became a politi
cal issue. It drove. Oakes Ames, James Brook* and
Colfax out of public life. It entered into two Presiden
tial campaigns. It was threshed out on the stump and
in the press. But in the end the United States got back
every dollar of its loan with good interest. The second
mortgage bonds of the United States to the Central pa
cific road amounted to $25,000,000. To get the money
for construction that issue was sold by the corporation
for $18,000,000. But the Government was finally paid
$67,000,000 for its issue of $25,000,000, and the corpora
tion paid back $49,000,000 more than it got for the
bonds.
Did the people suffer any loss in that transaction?
The corporation lost heavily. Had it borrowed $18,000,
oco of private capital at the high rate of interest which it
paid the Government in 1863-4 it could have refunded
the debt at a much reduced rate. But it had to stand
the loss of $7,000,000 discount on the bonds and pay high
interest on $25,000,000. It was a losing investment for
the corporation but a good one for the treasury of the
United States. So it came about that in the first trans
action which politicians said proved that a corporation
owned the Government the Government made money
and the corporation lost.
Since then there has been no law of Congress that can
be' honestly said to have put the Government in the
power of corporations or worked to the disadvantage of
the people. On the other hand we have the interstate
commerce law, which is the broadest assertion of the
command of transportation corporations by the Govern
ment; and the Sherman anti-trust law, which extends
the same principle to all manufactures and commerce.
The courts have responded clearly and closely to the
spirit of such legislation, and we have the highest ju
dicial decisions in every case brought by direction of
President Roosevelt up to'.that which dissolves the rail
road merger. â¢ " - . â¢â¢ . _â¢ . .
So, as far as the Federal. Government is concerned,
there is a total lack of evidence that the corporations
control it. The pessimists and advocates of public
ownership are therefore driven back upon State legis
lation for proof of their jeremiads. Where is it?
Take our own State, for example. The great ques
tion that for years kept our politics in a stew was the
issue of taxation of the railroads. The Federal decision
in the San Mateo.case vitiated the assessment of rail
road property. Every clear-headed layman, to say
nothing of lawyers, knew the assessment was legally
void. The railroad did just as individuals'do when sub
ject to illegal assessment. It fought payment in the
courts and won. Then of its own motion it asked the
Legislature to give the necessary authority for a .retro
active assessment and openly introduced its own bill for
that purpose. Immediately this was denounced as a
railroad measure and a bill representing the anti-corpo
ration party was substituted for it and passed. When
the assessment was made under it the discovery resulted
that the road would have paid a much larger sum in
taxes under its own bill than it did under the anti-rail
road substitute. So that incident closed. But while it
was a vital issue it was put in evidence to prove that
the corporation owned the State. The fact is that our
Legislatures have shown more vigor than wisdom in
demonstrating their virtue and independence of corpo
rate control..
â¢> No- one questions that corporations have to resist mere
cinch bills and use what in England was called a Parlia
mentary fund in doing it. Under the English system,
however, has arisen a method superior to any so far
reached here. The great financiers, railroad builders
and owners and other representatives of corporations
are members of Parliament. If they want legislation
they must ask for it. frame it and give reasons for it. It
will be seen that this secures the greatest publicity for
such legislation, and its purpose. Here our methods "of
party management practically outlaw the presidents of
corporations from public. life. The only instance which
we recall in which one has been sent to Congress- was
the election of Governor Stanford to the Senate while
he was president 'of the Southern, Pacific.
It is quite worth while to give some study to the sug
gestion that this decree of outlawry be rescinded, and
that men at the head of great interests be permitted to
appear as legislators. It might take all the strain out
of the relation of corporations to the public. If Gould,
Harriman, Ripley or Rockefeller had to stand. up in the
House .or Senate and give reasons for or against legis
lation they would be brought face to face with the
people, instead of being suspected of. staying in the back
ground and inspiring a covert advocacy or opposition in
regard to proposed legislation.
direct line would be retained and many
were the congratulations he. and the
Marchioness received when a son was
born to them. The history of the peer
age in recent years furnishes only one
parallel case. The late Viscount Bol
ingbroke had no heir until he was 76
years of age. He married when he was
73 years old a daughter of Mr. Robert
Howard." and the . present Viscount,
who is now 8 years of age, was born
three years later.
In other respects his marriage to the
Canadian girl was a fortunate one for
the old Marquis. Besides other things
that be Jacked, she has a -head for
business and took the management of
his property into her own hands. He
was on the point of selling the bulk of
it to his tenants, through the agency
of the Irish Land Court, but she fixed
up the troubles over the rent with the
result that the property has been re
tained along with the ancient family
residence, Chichester jCastle. It is un
derstood that when the conventional
period of mourning expires the young
Marchioness will take 'a town house
and enter society, in which, with her
youth, vivacity, ambition good
looks, she is likely to make something
of a stir.

plan, as it would afford a high pressure to all parts of the
city." Continuing, the report declares that "the saltwater
could be used for domestic purposes and for otHeT muni
cipal uses, such as flushing sewers, etc. It would render
our city safe from such calamities as have befallen Chi
cago, Boston and Baltimore."
This confirmation of the eminently practical scheme of
the Board of Fire Commissioners should give weight to
the consideration of the project and lead the Supervi
sors to make investigations as to the practicability of its
details. Although instances are few in the records of the
Fire Department, of late years at least, where a lack of
an adequate water supply stultified the efforts of the fire
fighters, we cannot err too far on the side of safety in the
matter of such emergencies. To be foref ended against
possible disaster-'in this matter is to enjoy by just that
degree freedom from constant, uneasiness.
San Francisco is a city of wood. Probably there is
not another one of the large cities of the country so
generally constructed of wood as our- own. Balti
more, whose main streets of steel-framed buildings were
gutted by the great fire of February, would have seemed
not half so ready a victim for the flames as our own city,
built on the hills and wind swept every day in the year.
Now, after disaster has] visited Baltimore, plans are being
made there for the utilization of salt water after the same
manner as that recommended by the Board of Fire Com
missioners and seconded by the. Grand Jury here. We
of San Francisco, seemingly immune as we may be with
our excellent fire department and its* very efficient equip
ment, cannot tell the day nor the hour when a Balti
more or a Rochester disaster will strike on the city by
the Golden Gate. The establishment of an auxiliary salt
water reserve supply would be a very valuable means of
prevention. " . '

order whose duty it shall be to super
vise the laws and examine the by
laws of all the lodges to see that they
are In conformity with the constitu
tion and the general laws of the or
ganization.
In the evening there was an exem
plification of the initiatory work and
the installation of the new officers,
after which the supreme body ad
journed for one year.
It was decided that hereafter the
supreme president shall select a team
from the lodges for the purpose of
exemplifying the work of the order
before the supreme body immediately
before the installation of the new of
ficers.
The recommendations of Supreme
President Lillie A. Dygert that the of
ficers of the several lodges memorize
the initiatory work of the order; that
the floor work be presented in a uni
form manner, and that a fine be im
posed on members of the executive
board who fail to attend meetings or
go on official visits, except excused for
absence from the city or illness, were
adopted.
A proposition to prevent the use of
wines or liquors at any lodge meeting
or entertainment or function given in
tl*e name of the order was defeated.
A proposition to appoint a supreme
district deputy for all the lodges of
the order was defeated on the ground
that the lodges prefer a deputy for
each lodge.
At the afternoon session the action
of the previous day, which was to the
effect that none but a past president
of a subordinate lodge selected as a
delegate to the supreme body should
be eligible to the office of supreme
president, was rescinded and as in the
past any delegate will be eligible to the
office.

Some Recommendations of
Supreme President Are
Favorably Acted Upon
ATTACKED IN HIS E00M
O. Alison was accused before, Judge
Cabaniss yesterday of stealing the
American flag and selling lÂ£. The
charge was reduced from treason to
petty larceny. Wrapped up in the flag
were f carpenter's square and plane,
all of j which he was accused of taking
unlawfully from the schooner Alice
Klmball. now anchored at Alameda
Point. Charles S. Martin, owner pf the
schooner, was "the complaining wit
ness. Alison claimed that the property
was his, having been purchased by him
when he was captain of the Alice Klm
ball two years ago. Evidence was
lacking to controvert this claim and
the defendant was^ discharged. The
prosecution said that a new complaint
The People's Laundry, located on Ed
dy street, near Fillmore, washed some
of Its dirty linen in Judge Mogan's
court yesterday. Joseph Toomey com
plained that Charles Elchelberger, one
of the proprietors, had battered him
painfully and without cause. Toomey
had at one time been employed as a
driver by the laundry, but had been 1
discharged.
At the time of the alleged, assault
he was passing airy persiflage with one
of the blanchisseuresâ In the People's
Laundry they call them washerwomen
which was contrary to the rules of
the Institution. More In Borrow than
In anger, Eichelberger grabbe'd Too
mey by the neck and the south end
of his trousers and cast him forth. He
found a resting place In an ash barrel
at the foot of twenty-three stairs and
then he sought Justice.
Eichelberger'a strenuous action dis
pleased the rest of the employes and
they went on a strike." In addition,
Toomey swore out a warrant for bat
tery against Eichelberger and all the
employes' of the laundry were on hand
to testify to the occurrence. When the
prosecution had concluded. Judge Mo
gan continued ' the case until to-day,
when the defense will Introduce testi
mony to show that the propelling of
Toomey was justifiable. .; â¢â¢â
He was in Judge Fritz's court yes
terday on a charge of petty larceny.
Two basketsful of fire plugs were in
troduced as evidence. These he had
disposed of to a junk dealer for six
cents a pound. Among the plunder
were four plugs, stolen from the new
fire house In course of construction In
the Mission. The defense secured a
continuance until to-day in order to
secure some further witnesses.
Fred Pierce is an elderly and enter
taining thief. He had a penchant for
collecting brass plugs from standpipes
that afford a water supply to high
buildings for use in case of flre. Not
being of a selfish disposition, he dis
tributes his collection when it has at
tained a volume sufficient to bring him
a few dollars.
Richard Price lapped up! entirely too
much booze for one man on Tuesday
night and his predatory instincts were
aroused. His quest was in search of
big game. First he "hefted" the dwell
ing of J. J. McCarthy, at 210 Morton
avenue, but was finally obliged to ad
mit that he was unable to lift the
house from its foundations and carry
it away. He then turned his attention
to a gas rAeter In the residence, weigh
ing 200 pounds. He managed to shoul
der this and was staggering away with
It when he was detected. To Judge
Fritz yesterday he explained that he
was terribly "soused" and did not know
what he was doing. He was banished
for thirty days to the County Jail as a
memory cure.
"I'll have to find you guilty of bat
tery, Mr. Brennan." said the Judge and
you will appear for sentence to-mor
row.
had a little argument in an Easi-street
saloon on Tuesday night regarding the
v.henceness of the why, and if s.o,
wherefore? When the interested spec
tators dug them- out of the sawdust
Sarsfield's face was swelling like a
dead horse In the sun. Brennan was
taken to Jail and yesterday morning
O'Brien appeared against him as com
plaining witness on a charge of bat
tery. In order to get O'Brien's face
into Judge Mogan's courtroom It was
necessary to open both doci-s.
"You are accused of walloping this
complainant â wallop is the correct
term, I believe?" said Judge Mogan,
turning to O'Brien.
"Ye're right. JedgÂ«," said the com
plainant. "Wallop is the word. . I'm
willing to swear to that. I was among
those present." Then he reached out
as far as he could and fondled his ex
huberent countenance.
"We Just got in a little mix, Yanner,"
said Brennan, "and I stood on his face
for a few minutes. That was all dere
was to It."
fused to^swear to a complaint against
her and sbe was discharged.
Immediately afterward George D.
Collins, attorney for Jean Pon, the os
tensible lessee of the premises, applied
for warrants for the arrest of Hutton
and the two policemen who made the
arrest under his direction. The charge
against them was false imprisonment.
Judge Cabaniss postponed the matter
until to-day in order to consult his as
sociate Police Judges. Police Judges
Cabaniss, Mogan and Fritz will sit en
bane and determine whether or not the
warrants shall be issued.
Superior Judge Cook Is out of the
city, but on his return an application
will be made to cite Hutton and the
two arresting officers for contempt, on
the ground that they have violated the
injunction.

Before Judge Cabaniss yesterday
Mary Duren, one of the inmates, was
charged with vagrancy. She had been
arrested as she was coming from the
premises by Policemen Barry and.Fen
nell, who were detailed for that par
ticular purpose by Police Commissioner
Hutton. Both of the policemen re-
Once again Police Commissioner
Harry. Hutton, "Special Chief of Po
lice" for the vicinity of 1129 Dupont
street, must answer for having directed
two policemen to violate the Injunction
issued by Superior Judge Cook against
interfering with the premises in ques
tion or any of its inmates.
William TakowskI is not a plumber,
but he said he was. He contracted to
"plumb" the house of James O'Rourke
on Howard street and the Job was a
bad one. Not only did his work have
boulders in it, but he used a lot of
second-hand stuff that was full of blow
holes. He was arrested for practicing
the eminent and lucrative profession
of plumbing without a license. Judge
Mogan heard the testimony and took
the case under advisement.
Yakowski will be remembered as the
Russian who first put the police on the
trail of the real murderers of the Web
ber family In Sacramento in the year
1895. They were Russian refugees from
Saghalien and on YakOwskl's testi
mony one of them, KoveleVby name,
was hanged. \
"Dr." W. J. Sylvester, a patent heal
er, who is tinged to the color of an old
saddle, was convicted yesterday in
Judge Mogan's court of practicing
medicine without a license. He de
manded a Jury trial and he got itâ
somewhere about the carotid artery.
He will be sentenced on Saturday.

"Kid" Nash, who promised a few
days since to go to Chicago if, he were
granted his freedom on a couple of
misdemeanor charge's, did not keep his
word. He started all right but drop
ped off the train at its first stop and
returned to the city. He was before
Judge Mogan yesterday on a charge
of burglary at the Hotel Rex on Turk
street. If the police manage to make
a case against Nash what he will get
will be plenty for three men.
Mrs. Carroll, trembling with age and
excitement, promised to be good in the
future and to find new lodgings'within
a reasonable time. "With this under
standing she was dismissed.
"Stop! stop!" he commanded; "I am
old and hardened and might bear such
language, but there are a number of
young and tender reporters here whose
thin-gilt souls might tÂ»e hopelessly
stained to hear more of this kind at
thing."
Mrs. Brown repeated some choice ex
cerpts from the conversation pf Mrs.
Carroll and as she proceeded the Judge
buried his face in his hands and shud
dered.
Mrs. Annie Carroll !s seventy years
of age and pays her rent promptly, but
she has a ffow of language that would
peel the hide from a, fourteen-year-old
mule. She is the tenant of Mrs. Mary
Brown at No. 2 Shipley street and her
landlady had her arrested because of
her vigorous language.
"In order that I may arrive at an
understanding of the case," said Judge
Cabaniss to Mrs. , Brown, "you must

tenants."

TWO STAKES WILL BE RUN
AT UNION PARK ON SUNDAY
CHICAGO, June 8. â Dr. Knudson,
â¢who operated . on Starter # Richard
Dwyer for appendicitis late "Saturday
night, reiterated his statement to-day
that Dwyer would certainly be able to
send the <horses away in the American
Derby at Washington Park on the 18 th
inst. Dwyer is making- much better
progress than had been anticipated
and not the slightest cause for alarm
is felt by Dr. Knudson or by the con
sulting physicians. It is only a ques
tion.'of a few days before Dwyer will
be out and around as strong as ever.
Dick Dwyer Recovers Rapidly.
Non-union freight handlers are rapidly load
ing the cars at the Townsend street depot.
The company has managed to secure 300 men
to take the places of the men who struck Sun
day night for an Increase of pay. When the
green hands went to work they could not keep
the sheds clear of goods coming In for ship
ment, but they are rapidly catching up and
the foremen in charge of the .gangs say the
new hands are improving daily.
Checking clerks were to have held a meet
ing at noon yesterday to finally settle the
question of whether they would Join the
strikers or remain at work. Without going
through the formality of a regular meeting
the decks decided to remain at work.
That action was a great drawback to the
freight handlers', for with the clerks out of the
sheds there would be better chances of the
company considering the demands of the men.
Disappointment was freely expressed by the
strikers when they learned of the action taken
by the clerks. No demonstrations have been
made by the men thus far, and they say there
will be none.

GRAVESEXD, June 8. â When Bar
dolph. a HO to 1 shot, beat out the
odds-on favorite. Ascension, in to
day's opening event, the betting ring
contained a jovial lot of bookmakers.
When a horne is Quoted at 50 to 1 it
moans he is practically unbacked and
when a favorite runs second at odds
on there is but little money to pay
out for a place. So the race practi
cally meant a clean sheet for nearly
all the layers.
There was. however, an awful reck
oning during the' remainder of the*
afternoon. Four heavily backed fa
vorites and a third choice landed, so,
notwithstanding the balance on the
ripht side of the ledger that Bar
dolph's victory gave the layers, the
bookmakers quit big losers on the day.
â¢â¢Joe" Yeager was a busy, man dur
ing the afternoon. He tried to make
a killing with Morris Kayraan's Or
t%>dox and backed him heavily from
six down to one. He failed, however.
N*cxt he plunged on Chrysitis in the
Clover stakes. Teager was making
l>ook to-day, but he laid "no price
against Chrypitis. While he was busy
laying against Czaraphine, Incantation
nnd - Simplicity, his commissioners
were betting on Pierre Lorillard's filly
around 3 to 1.
The victory of Chrysitis only netted
Teager about J 20.000 in bets, but his
book had practically a clean sheet and
it is estimated his total winning* were
clsse to $35,000. Summaries:

The Commuters were also there. Gan
ley got a tap on the shirt and Francks
sacrificed him along the line. Schlafley
ewung through with a long double to
left field and the run was easy. In
round three Hlldebrand bit off a -triple
which bounded .off the house in left
field and it looked good for a run with
but one out. Waldron tore a torrid
skipper at Schlafley and he neatly
fielded Hilde out at the pan.
Both teams laid up against the ball
occasionally till the seventh, but the
hits did no damage. Devereaux start
ed the seventh * for Oakland with a
drive to left and Mosklman sacrificed.
Julie Streib made his first timely hit
in weeks, a two-baser, to the score
board, that decided the Issue. Oak
land sot another in the eighth though
It was not needed. Miller erred on
Schlafley's grounder and Reitz failed
to cover second when Leahy winged
the ball on an attempted steal, so
Schlafley pulled up at third. Kruger
partook of a pass and tore for second.
Schlafley was nailed en a bluff throw
and thereby lost a run, for Devereaux
followed with a single, bringing Kruger
in. The score: .

For a long time the contest at
Recreation Park yesterday was in
the gloomiest kind of doubt, and
no one had a line on what was due to
happen. Both teams were occasionally
tearing off a bingle and fielding for
fair. The Commuters just barely
squeezed a tally through in the sev
enth. Every one knew that was enough
to hold Henry and 'his for a while.
Score 3 to 1.
No fan could cdrnplalrr"6'f the variety
of ball passed out. Hitting there was
In plenty, with lots of bright fielding
and good pegging to bases by the
catchers. Buchanan was the steadier
pitcher with men on bases. He never
wavered, and when he did walk Irwin
in the ninth round the umpire gave him
a shade the worst of it. .
It started off like one of those ancient
battles of the bats where runs just
came streaming in. When two were
faded in the first round, Waldron land
ed one for two bags out to the score
board and Meany got a shot in the ribs.
Captain Irwin had a little hit stored
away which he produced at the right
moment, bringing Wally in.

(Pacific Coast League.)
BUCHANAX IS EFFECTIVE
One squint into the gymnasium this
morning would dissipate any idea one
might possess of , the champion's
lack of condition. For three or four
days, owing to Joe Kennedy's lame
wrist, he had not donned the gloves,
but this* morning -he -got the carpet
sweeper- out- and gave both Brother
Jack and Kennedy a thorough sweep
ing. The night before, while playing
on the opposing ball team, both of his
sparring partners incurred the dislike
of Jeff by their kicking tactics and he
promised them an enjoyable outing
next time out in the gym. He put each
through a fast four-round bout and a
horse clipper could not have performed
its work with more neatness nor dis
patch. *
Jack Jeffries had a square inch of
skin tissue removed from over one eye
and Kennedy looked as if he might
have got in range of the Japanese siege
guns planted on the heights command
ing the approaches to Port Arthur.
John Marcovich, a great friend of the
champion, dropped in from Calistoga
at this stage of the proceedings and
Jeff cut the balance of his work short.
After skipping the rope nearly 600
times, he quit and started for the
plunge. Before dinner a run down the
road completed his training for the
day.
After dinner Jeff officiated in a pig
sticking contest down at the pens. As
a result there were two porkers less
and to-morrow's guests will play
against roast pork and apple sauce,
straight, place and show.
The champion's face is beginning to
show the effects of his labor and he
says that now he must be careful and
not overdo things. After his fast
eight rounds with the gloves he scarce
ly took a long breath. Arrangements
have been made by the Jeffries camp
to leave for Oakland next Tuesday and
then the public can judge for itself
whether or not big Jim ia In condition.
HARBIN SPRINGS, June i.â If the
city sports fell for the yarn that Jim
Jeffries was in no shape and had
quietly asked for a postponement of
his contest with Jack Munroe, set
for the Mechanics' Pavilion on the
17th inst., it is the fault of no one at
this end of the line. Gullible people
can be found the wqrld over and may
be the ghost of P. T. Barnum has en
gaged in the boxing game, i
. When' 'Dick Adams, the Eddy-street
tavern-keeper and promoter, left here
last Saturday for San Francisco it
was to float his latest project. , Dick
claims to have discovered a well of
natural hot air in a huge cavern up
back of the training quarters and saw
millions in sight if it could be piped
to the city. Adams took along with
him several quicksilver flasks filled
with his discovery and his last words
as he climbed on the stage were,
'Watch me!" Dick gained some fame
as the composer of the war-time bal
lads, "When the Smoke Rolls Away,"
"Papa . Came Home Half Shot,"
"Matches, Matches, Matches," "Charge
of the Baltimore House Pipers," "Keep
My Gun in Good Repair," etc. Adams
was always a sensationalist and when
Jeff laughingly spoke of the. scare the
report ,had caused below he said, "I
wish I had a-hold of that sucker, what
a duckin' in the pond he'd get,"
Last summer, when the big fellow
was conditioning himself for his match
with Jim Corbett, there was a chance
then for a postponement. While fool
ing: with Brownie, the bear, the little
fellow sank his teeth in one of Jeff's
shins, and for a time it looked as If
there would be no. fight. This trip,
though, the bollermaker has not even
been run over by a freight train, kicked
in the face by a mule, lost an arm
monkeying around a buzz saw, blown
the shingles off his roof while out
shooting or been held up by female
road agents. In fact, he has enjoyed
a phenomenal run of luck.'.-

Jack Munroe proved . himself a
wicked puncher yesterday afternoon
in his work at the Beach Gymnasium
and it was the opinion of the spec
tators that if he exchanges blows with
Jeffries the people in Mechanics' Pa
vilion on the 17th instant will see the
greatest championship contest ever de
cided here.
Trainer in Chief Tim McGrath had
a string of aspiring heavy-weights to
be tried out yesterday and the man
from Butte went down the line in
short order. On the previous day
Manasso, the man who looks like
Jeffries, was given some love taps
which satisfied him that hewvas not
to be the successor of Je/TrTes. He
did not return yesterday. It is ex
pected there will be some more ab
sentees when the roll is called this
afternoon. Olin Sullivan was the first
victim. He started at a fast clip, but
Munroe soon took all the fight out of
him. Ivan McDonald was next on the
list and lasted less than a minute when
Tim McGrath called time. Joe Long
went down from a slight blow on the
body which showed Munroe's great
strength. Jack Sullivan. Andy Galla
gher and Frank Rafael also had on
the gloves. Gallagher and Rafael
took Munroe a fast boxing clip, but
he was ready for anything they had.
Munroe shows marked improvement
in his style of boxing. He blocks well,
hits a true blow and seems never off
his balance. . He 1b always set and can
hit from any position. He is built very
much on the lines of Young Corbett
and his muscles are not prominent.
He' never let up .in his gymnasium
work, going from the punching bag to
the swinging bag and then down the
line of the boxers without a rest. He
perspires freely and his flesh has a
ruddy, Kealthy appearance. His nose
is badly skinned as the result of some
rough work. As he will not. box for
three days before the tight, these slight
wounds will heal readily.
Owing to the crush of visitors at the
training quarters, an admission fee of
50 cents is exacted. This has not had
a deterring effect on the attendance,
the gymnasium being packed to its ca
pacity each afternoon.
Harry Pollock. Munroe's manager,

TEACHES MEN WHO HANG
JURIES A SHARP UESSON
Judge Gesford Marks His Displeasure
In a Way That Will Bring
Them to Time.
"Mr. Sheriff, you will see that those
men are properly cared for during the
night and if they are ready to bring
in a verdict by 10 o'clock to-morrow
morning I shall be prepared to receive
it. Counsel is excused till the same
time." . )
Judge Gesf ord Â¦ of Napa, who Is sit
ting in Judge Cook's court, gave these
orders at 5 o'clock yesterday after
noon, when it was made plain to him
that the jury In the case of John Pry
or. charged with burglary, was in
clined to disagree. The case was tried
yesterday and the Jury retired about
3 o'clock to consider the verdict, but
had not come to an agreement at 5
o'clock. Pryor is charged with enter
ing' the room of Ross Varnum at 18
Ellis street by means of the window
on the morning of January 1.
The Judge's action was caused by
the failure of the Jury in the case of
Henry Peterson, tried for burglary on
Tuesday, to agree, although it was
shown that the proprietor of the res
taurant entered had caught Peterson
in the act and had been knocked
senseless by a blow from an iron bar.
Under Sheriff Secures Witnesses.
Under Sheriff William D. Hynes re
turned yesterday from Quartz Valley,
â¢where he went to bring back Mr. and
Mrs. Rose Barnum to testify as wit
nesses in the trial of John Pryor, who
is charged with burglary in having en
tered the room of the couple at 18 Ellis
street last December. The presence
of the Bamums was necessary to in
sure Pryor's conviction. Hynes had
to travel over forty miles of rocky
roads' to serve the summons on the
Barnums and was glad to get back.

There Are Too Many Knockers at
the University of Michigan.
ANN ARBOR. Mich., June 8. â The
University of Michigan will be minus
one star athleto when the time comes

Rose, the phenomenon of the year In

gives every reason of being.
"I will not come back to Michigan
next year." Rose stated. "There are
too many knockers around. I have
been talking with Stanford men who
were- at Chicago and I know what to
expect at the Palo Alto school. It Is
good enough .for me. If I come East
next year. It will be as a member of
the Stanford team."

to be the Antelope, Captain Cuthrell, out three
days from Coquille River. The tug Sea Rover,
which waa dispatched to her assistance, towed
the disabled schooner Into port early yesterday
morning. Captain Cuthreil reports that June 6
at 10 a m.. when fifteen miles north of the
Farallones, the Antelope, was caught in a
northwest gale, during which she sprung a leak
over which the pumps had no control. She waa
loaded with lumber and could not sink. To add
to the woeÂ« of those on board, however the
rudder was carried away and the vessel be
came unmanageable. Part of her deck load
washed away and for thirty hours the crew'a
plight was perilous In the extreme. The loos
ened and ever dwindling deck, load increased
the difficulties of the situation, but all hands
stayed with the fight until help arrived. The
Rover took off the cold, tired and hungry aall

battered, craft safely to port, where It is now

The Coptic brought more passengers
than any c-f the smaller oriental liners
coming this way has carried in some
time. Homeward bound vessels will
be crowded, it Is said, for some time,
many business men coming home to es
cape the heat. When the Coptic left
Hongkong the demand for accommoda
tions was In excess of the available
space.
The Coptic's passengers Included the
following named:
Viscount T. Torii of Japan was a
passenger as far as Honolulu. He will
visit this country before returning to
Japan. Among the passengers who
arrived here yesterday was Mrs. Fred
Ringer of Nagasaki. Mrs. Ringer's
husband is a member of the firm cf
Holme, Ringer & Co. She is going to
Europe, making the trip for her health.
Captain Forteath and Captain R.
Kilbee-Stuart. both of the British
army, were passengers on th.e liner.
They .have been on duty in the Far
East and are returning to England on
leave of absence. There were several
missionaries among the Coptic's pas
sengers, which fact, according to the
sailors, accounted for the head winds
encountered coming up from Hono
lulu. |
The Occidental and Oriental Steam
ship Company's liner Co-ptk-, Captain
Armstrong, which arrived from the
Orient late Tuesday night, passed quar
antine after sunrise yesterday morn
ing and was alongside the Pacific Mail
wharf by 7 o'clock. The Coptic brought
about 80 cabin passengers, "27 steerage
and a large number of Japanese in
the Asiatic steerage. She brought 2201
tons of freight, which Included Japan
ese gold yen valued at $3,000,000. This
is said to- be the second largest single
shipment of gold ever sent out of
Yokohama. Her cargo included 5010
boxes of tea, 2467 bales of hemp. 641
bales of gunnies, 192 bales of raw silk.
143 bales silk soods and 100 bags of
coffee. Fine weather prevailed be
tween Hongkong and Honolulu. From
the island port to Fan Francisco the
Coptic bucked strong head winds.
Gold and silver medals were presented yes
terday to the otflcers and crtw who were on
the eteam^'hip Queen February 27, and who on
that date saved the vessel and the lives of
those on board from destruction by fire.' In
presenting these tokens the Pacific Coast
gteamihlp Company made oiflcistl recognition
of the gallant service rendered by sixty-setfen
biave men. The (Tnedals, handsome as they
ar, are not Intended as Intrinsic return for
value received, but as u permanent token of
the company's appreciation, and as such every
man that yesterday received one is to-day
wearing It with prld*. The insurance com
panies will probably follow In the company's
footstep? before the new Queen has made
many trips.

The Algoa is at Grecnwleh-Ktreet wharf, being
discharged under full pressure. The City of
Peking is unloading coffee at the seawall. At
the Mall dock the Siberia and Newport are br
ing made ready tu go to sea on Saturday.
Much of the cargo to be carried by the Siberia
consiFtfi cf heavy pieces of railroad equipment,
and the service* of an army of men are neces
sary to the placing of them on board without
damaging the veseel or injuring, the freight.
On top of all this the Coptic docked yesterday
with ir.ur â¢ than -'Â«j" tons of miscellaneous
freight. If the Â»h!ps were all at one dock the
problem wuuld be Hufficlently difficult, but

proves your character so that you will reach
the highest possible development In mental

FROM ALL SECTIONS THEY COME TO
WITNESS THE WONDERFUL DEMON-
STRATIONS of the NOTED LIVINGSTONE.
Kor a reliable and intelligent clairvoyant
reading go to LIVINGSTONE, 428 Eddy st.
lie asks you no questions, but tells you
what you wish to know.
He *does not mention all the Ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facGi In your case. Let PROFESSOR
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, find the cause of trouble and
sussest the remedy.
He is as conspicuous for his wonderful oc-
cult analysis as he is for his original ex-
pression and vivid truthfulness.
Would it not be a relief to know how you
will succeed, to be relieved of the matters that
arn troubling you <ind of the schemes of your
enemies, that you may meet with better success?
A test reading- is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full life reading for $1. A test
Is of little value; when the mind Is troubled
you need more substantial aid and advice.

WE DID THE WORK.
The freight handlers' strike Is ov*r> â almost
before It was begun.
A more Ill-advised affair it would be hard
to conceive.
At a time when a large number of men arÂ«
walking the streets looking for work these
men saw fit to attempt to cinch the Southern
Pacific R. R. Co., and as a result now find
themselves out of Jobs while other and wiser
men hold their positions, and other hands will
receive the pay checks.
In the short space of three days wÂ« supplied
the R. Tt. Co. with 533 men. and could have
doubled the number If necessary.
In our "Labor Problem" we declarÂ«d our
conviction that the police of this city werÂ«
willing to do their duty if allowed to. and ths
events of the last few days have proven our
conviction to be correct. To Chief Wittman.
to Captain Splllane and the men under them
In the disturbed district, we wish to return
thanks for the protection which they afforded
OS while engaged in sending men there^ A
large number of strikers were gathered
around our offices and the railroad yards, yet
not a tingle case, of assault has occurred.
This irmaikable fact Is evidence enough of the
splendid protection, afforded by the police oC
San Francisco.
In conclusion we v wish to state that we har-
bcr no 1H feellnsr toward thÂ» unfortunate
strikers and, as we know no distinction be-
tween^ man and man, cur services in securing
other positions for them are at their disposal,
should they see fit to avail themselves of them.

With the spread of education dead
languages and foreign tongues are no
longer mysteries soluble only by the
cultured few. The famous Eton boy
who rendered "splendid mendax"' as
"lying Jn state" is but a pioneer. Quite
recently a pupil teacher, fairly well ad
vanced in her teens, who at a teachers'
center is still learning to read French
with a furious Cockney accent, and to
decipher it, was taken to lunch at a
French restaurant in Soho. Scanning
the menu with a show of Interest which
a healthy appetite alone could hardly
have excited, she was overheard to
murmur: "Canard sauvage aux pctits
pols" ("Theduck Is savage at the few
peas").â London Daily Chronicle.

A Duke's â¢ Treasures.
In illustration of the lavishness with
which Chatsworth House is endowed
with art treasures and of the distant
element which Is supposed to be a fea
ture of the Duke of Devonshire's mind
an amusing story went the round of
the French press at the time of the
last Paris exhibition. The 'Duke, it was
said, was strolling through the loan
section of the English exhibits with a
friend and . stopped to look with ad
miration at a porphyry table of match
less beauty. He examined it long with
the eye of a connoisseur and j at last
exclaimed: "I wonder who is the owner
of such a splendid specimen of work
manship. I almost feel inclined to envy
him." His companion, who had con
culted the catalogue,' handed it to him
with a smile. It contained the infor
mation that the table came from
Chatsworth House and was lent by the
Duke of Devonshire.â- London Chron-Â»

NEW YORK. June 8. â Tuesday's upward
, moidnmt of prices was carried over into to
| <3a> s market and. with some show cf energy
j on the part of rrcf entjona 1 operators, a re
spectafcle and quite repreaentative showing of
gains were established during th? cours*? of
he trading There was nothing doing in the
loan part of the market. The market became
cxtren.ely languid at the higher level, and thÂ«
buying gav* evidence o f quick exhaustion. It
1 is not important to discover the causes for so
iasigninrant a movement. But so far as gen
eral cause* op-rated a distinctly hopeful feel-
Ing over thÂ« progress in the making of the
crupÂ« waÂ« perceptible. The- day' B weather
news withstood this feeling and prepared the
speculative mind to discount to nome extent
any favorable fears of the Government's
monthly report of grain condition on June 1
Some effect was produced by reports of an
unexpectedly large volume of pa**en*er traf
fic as a reFUlt of travel to the St. Louis ex
position and extended to the Kast Â£<->me at
tention was paid also to a published story
that a pl*n for the settlement out of ccmrt
of the Hill-Harriman dispute over the distri
bution of Northern firruritlÂ»>Â« assets was under
discussion, although thÂ» story was denied. ThÂ»
Hoftn.ss of thÂ«- I/ondon discount market, which
yielded to below 2 per cent for open market,
dlbcounts gave ground for an expectation that
th* Bank of England would reduce it* mini
mum rate of discount to-morrow below 3 per
cent. This would tend to avert any movement
of gold from New York to London, and \fould
indicate tl>ai the supplyof capital has reached
repletion at London as well as Paris. The
WfftÂ«rn Union's statement of net earnings
for the June quarter were studied with inter
est, although the current month's earnings are
only estimated. The decline of 7 per cent !n
the earnings indicated, compared with the cor
responding quarter of last year, la regarded
as throwing light on the relative volume of
general business activity. Recoveries in a
number of low-priced railroad stocks which
have beÂ«n under pressure recently, presumably
due to covering by shorts, made up an. im
portant showing In the day's advances.
Bonds were Irregular. Total sales, par
value, were $2,335,000.
United States 2s and the old 4s advanced
'i. and the new 4s declined % per cent on call.

WHEATâ The foreign markets continued
quiet at about previous prices. A Calcutta
cable said that the Government's final esti
mate gave the Indian crop at 9,388,000 tons,
against 7,775,000 tons last year.
Wires from Chicago to Mitchell, Mulcahy & j
Co. reported fine weather throughout the West
and the cash situation slow. Snow, the statis
tician, estimates the condition of winter Wheat
June 1 at 76.3. against 74.5 May 1 and 82.2
as "given by the Government a year ago. The
condition of spring Wheat Is placed at 90.9.
against 93.7 last year, this lower condition
being mainly due to cold weather. The acreage
Is about the same as last year, or 20,11)0,000
acres. The tone of the market Is heavy, with
a dragging tendency.
The local market is firm as to cash grain,
but futures are lower again.

BARLEY â Futures were lower, partly in
sympathy with the decline In Wheat futures,
but mainly due to the discovery that the recent
drying winds have changed the character of
the grain this year. According to H. A.
Wright of the firm of Yates & Wright a good
deal of grain which would have been Brewing
was caught in the milk by the winds and
turned into Feed. This change will Increase
the quantity of Feed to about 65 or 70 per
cent of the crop and cut down the proportion [
of Brewing to correspond. This makes Feed
weak and would make Brewing strong if there
were any demand for It.

Hay and Feedstuff s.
The millers continue to quote a firm tor\p to
Feedstuffs, with more call tor Bran, as the
dairymen are now beginning to feed It. Prices
Ctand the same.
Somers & Co. quote the Hay market as fol
lows In their circular:
"Total receipts of Hay for the week just
ended amount to 2100 tons, or 300 tons less than
for the week preceding. Although we are well
past the 1st of June, yet very little of the ar
rivals Is new crop Hay. Two or three cars
of new wheat have arrived, but as yet none of
them have been offered on the- market. Two
or three cars daily of new Volunteer have been
offered for sale, and. although an occasional
car shows up straight and clean, yet most
everything is mixed more or less with clover
and grass. The range at present Is from $7 to
$S per ton here.
"The old crop seems to hold out well, and
from all reports it would seem that there Is
enough to carry us well past the 1st of July.
The local demand I. very quiet, for most cus
tomers believe that by waiting they will be
able to stock up at considerably lower prires.
A careful Investigation shows that the Hay
crop is somewhat heavier than last year, and,
as we still have quite a supply of old Hay, it
Is very reasonable to believe that prices will
rule at considerably below last summer's range.
We do not expect extremely low prices, but
no one seems to be prepared to go out and pay
what they dM last season.
"It Is somewhat of a disappointment to
have to report that the Government order for
about 4000 tons, bids for which were received
on the 4th inst.. may not be left In San
Francisco. We have no assurance as to this,
but it Is unofficially stated that the north
will be favored with this order in spite of the
fact thaf' their prices were above ours.
"As to our local market we have to report
that the principal trade Js with the retailers,
and wn therefore find that the strictly gllt
edgc grades of Hay are selling fairly well."

came In and received a bid of $5 75 per ton,

I EASTERN MARKETS. !
Fluctuations.
Another Inactive Day, With Few
Early In the day sentiment In corn was
firm. Weakness of wheat. . however, soon
brought out a number t>r sales.' 'â¢ TTie*clOse was
at the low point. July opened at -OV-jc to
i'.iKc and closed at 48%@iS%c. . .,
Oats were the strongest of the grains and
showed enly a slight loss. July ranged be
tween 31 %c and 4te and closed at 39%c.
An advance of 10Q15c tn the price of hogs
caused a strong tone in provisions early, but
during the latter part of the session the gain
was lost on profit taking. At the close Sep
tember pork was down 12^c, lard wan off
2 '/4c and ribs were 5Â®7%c lower.
CHICAGO, June S. â Under the influence of
weather conditions and indifferent cables the
wheat market opened weak, the July delivery
being off {i@%c at S7?ic to 8734c. Sentiment
was quite bearish, in spite of a considerable
decrease of receipts In the Northwest. Private
cablegrams from India confirmed previous an
nouncements of a record breaking crop. Ad
vices from the Southwest stated that favorable
progress was being made In harvesting. News
from the Northwest regarding spring wheat
showed that the crop was In excellent condi
tion. A report of a local statistician claimed
that within the past month the condition of
wheat had Improved nbout 2 per cent. Lack of
business, coupled with the large number of
bear rises, seemingly disheartened small trad
ers. . The result was liberal. The - market
closed weak. After selling at 66%c July closed
at 86V,Â©t<7c.

The Latter Will Govern Business
This Year.
Henrv OentÂ« says In his New York circular:
"Gold export* have been renewed upon a mod
erate scale, the ec&rclty of commercial bi'.ls
rauflr.g a frrsh advance in sterling. Had bars
been available more gold would have gone;
but coin Is the only form in which gold can
now be exported, and this Is Us* profitable.
Additional arrival* from Japan facilitated the
outward movement, and the probability | s that
further shipments will be made during the
next few w<.*ks. At present, howevtr. there
is no occation for anxiety regarding the for
eign demand* upon our P>"Â«ld Â«apply. which is
ample and v/ill soon be replenished by arrivals
from the Klondike to say nothing of our own
production and further imrorts from Japan.
For>-ipn requirements, moreover, will eoon be
Â»atis!xd. M that the prospect of any further
lÂ«iÂ»;e s+.iprnenis are somewhat remote, espe
cially as future cotu-n and grain bills will
eooa be available. The nioM unsatisfactory
featutt in the money market as affecting the
pnld movement is the redundancy of our bank
note currency, which it a very potent Influence
In sitmulatin? pold shipments. Our bank-note
i . jrrerwy ba* already bÂ«en expanded about
% y3Ht.oro.ooo during the last seven years, and in
tbf last twelve months the new circulation
taken out was nearly $4rt,0f*MÂ«<>0 â at a time
â¢when money was already abundant. This is
by the present price of Government
bond*, admitting of circulation being put out
at Â« profit. Had we a really sound, or in
other words an elastic <uirrenc-y system, the
fui ;>ly would contract when redundant and
exjand when scarce. As it is. we are obliged
to wrijrple along under a system which con
nantly threatens embarrassment and work*
In defiance of all sound and natural influences.
In I his connection it is worthy of note that
Government receipts are decreasing and ex
penses tncreaeirut ; so that this year we are
facing a Treasury deficit. Naval expenditures
and pensions are chiefly responsible for In
creased expenses, the Panama payment being
e special ilem, while receipts have been di
minished by a falling off in customs. Were
It not that we now possess a handsome sur

INFLl'KNCE OF THE CROPP.
-One favorable feature Is the increase in
exports of manufactures from the 1'nlted
Ftates. <iur manufactured iron exports during
the last ten months amounting to $$3,000,000.
or nearly $lÂ«.tÂ«XÂ«.000 more than during the
>Â¦ Â¦- Â¦ time last year. This demonstrates that
reour*rative influÂ»Â»nees are at work which will
in due season jÂ»rÂ»pare the war for a fresh re
covery. The decline of cottcn to more normal
level is also a reassuring feature. Crop jfl-os
j-f^ets thus far have tv*>n fax-orable as a whole.
Wheat condition is improving; ccrn planting is
makir.g favorable r r Â°Eress. and cotton, which
shows a record-breaking acreage, has made a
better ttart than iast year. This year unusual
reliant will bÂ« placed upon the crops; for
t Â¦ â¢ y more than any other factor will govern
Jkide industry and finance of the country for
,w balance of this year. The elections are
naturally an influence of some uncertainty:
but less *"> than is usually the <-ase during
J'retideni.ial years. The tariff appears to be
the only disturbing l*sue, and indirations are
that talk on that subject will b* vastly more
threatening than action. All probabilities point
to a quiet campaiirn. In financial circles there
It & confident undertone owing to belief that
liquidation has run its course e^id that price*
of erxvi securities are ready to respond to good
Influence* as soon as these appear with any
real force; but the bis leaders wera dlsposÂ«*d
to wait until it is seen what the next two

Philip Eastwick Jr., cashier for the
International Banking Corporation,
testified as to the conversation at the
cashier's window when Jacob Eppin
ger was negotiating the loan with Col
onel Beck. He stated that the defend
ant wished to borrow $25,000 or $30,000.
Colonel Beck was willing to loan the
money, but asked 6 per cent Interest.
Eppinger said this was too high and a
compromise was finally made at 5%
per cent. Attorney Dunne subjected
the witness to a rigid cross-examina
tion, but was unable to shake his tes
timony.
The case will be resumed at 9:30 this
morning, when the cross-examination
of McFaul will be resumed.
W. C. Ledeme, receiving teller for the
London. Paris and American Bank,
testified as to having received the
check for $9800 issued by the Interna
tional Banking Corporation on April
14. He Identified the check and It was
admitted in evidence.
The defense then proceeded along the
line of the financing of the prosecution,
seeking to find now much money had
been raised to defray the expenses of
the trial, from what sources and in
what manner It .was expended.
Colonel Beck testified that the money
had been raised partially under his di
rection by a committee and had been
disbursed by him with the approval of
the committee. A portion of the mon
ey,- he said, was paid to J. C. Camp
bell to act as special prosecutor and
the remainder was turned over to
Wells, Fargo & Co. This money was
raised not only to prosecute Jacob Ep
pinger, but all persons who might be
connected with ' the failure. Attorney
Dunne attempted to learn from the
witness Just how much money had been
raised, but in line with a previous rul
ing Judge Liawlor sustained the pros
ecution's objection to the question.

action. The defense on the other hand
argued that the greater the amount
Involved the more animus was likely
to be shown by the witness and the
more activity by the prosecution. After
listening to the arguments Judge Law
lor, quoting from a Supreme Conrt de
cision, ruled that the question was not
a fair one.
The case wilj_be called again , this
morning at m o'clock. Oakland Is'rep
resented by Mayor Warren Olney, City
Attorney John E. McElroy. R. M. Fitz
gerald and W. R. Davis.
Heney said there w,as no reason why
the affidavits should not be admitted
unless Oakland expected to win on
technicalities. Furthermore, it was im
possible to gather the data contained
in the affidavits in time. to furnish the
defendants a copy, but that copies
would be furnished by -this morning.
The matter was argued for over an
hour, but at thw finish Judge Gilbert
said he would allow the affidavits to be
admitted owing, to the serious nature
of the suit and the great questions in
volved. Attorney Heney proceeded
with the reading of. Adams' affidavit
and then offered additional ones from
George T. Lafiesche. William Alvord,
G. W. Kline. I. W.Hellman. George A.
Moore. Jacob Brith. P. McK. Duperu
and Henry S. Gore.
WHAT OAKIiAXD WANTS.
Garret W. McEnerney, who is asso
ciated with Heney and John Garber,
took exception to the statement made
by Mayor Olney regarding the under
standing about the. filing of affidavits.
He saia it had been understood that
the city of. Oakland through its attor
neys intended to file affidavits and as
the attorneys for plaintiffs could not
anticipate the nature of those docu
ments the affidavits offered by the
company could, not be served on the
defendants at the time the complaint
â¢was filed.
Olney claimed that the suit was
brought in reality to take away the
power of the city to regulate water
rates and that the company simply
wanted to put ' the affidavits into the
case to strengthen Its position.
Heney replied, saying the sole ques
tion before the court was not whether
the plaintiff had established a case,
but whether a temporary Injunction
should be granted to prevent the de
fendants from putting arbitrary, rates
Into effect. The admission of supple
mentary affidavits would simply pro
vide additional Information to aid the
court to determine the question of de
nying or granting the injunction
prayed for. Under the law the rates
should have been fixed in February,
but they were not fixed until May 31
and then arbitrarily. The affidavits
would -'show -those 'facts and should be
admitted. -â¢.'- r- â¢'.â¢'-â¢
Attorney Francis J. Heney opened
the case for the company by explaining
to the court the nature of the action.
His contention was that the rates the
city proposes to put into effect on July
1 will not give the company more than
6 per cent on its Investment and that
amount would leave the company in
debt to the amount of 510,000 at the end
of each year the rates are In" effect.
The actu U value of the plant, accord-
Ing to the company's figures, is $7,500,
000. and the additional value of the
franchise Is $1,000,000. The com
pany has a bonded Indebtedness of
$3." n 0,000. upon which It has to pay In
terest at the rate of 5 per cent i.er
annum, but this will be an impossibil
ity if the rates fixed by. the Council
are allowed to stand.
In order to establish his contention
Attorney Heney offered an affidavit
signed by Arthur L. Adams, an expert
engineer, and former manager of the
company. Heney started to read the
document, but Mayor Warren Olney of
Oakland, who is the leading counsel
for the city, objected that under the
rules of the court affidavits were not
admissible. He argued that the case
before the court was one Involving
the rights of every municipality in the
State and that unless the court up
held its time-honored rule the rights
of all legislative bodies would be in
Jeopardy.
RIGHTS INVOLVED.
The legal battle between the Contra
Coeta Water Company and the city of

gives promise of being a long fight.
The company asks for an injunction to
restrain the city from putting into ef
fect on July 1 the rates established by
the City Council May 31. Under the
contract w,ith the company the. city
sets the rates to be collected from con
sumers of water and in fixing those
rates the valuation of the plant is
taken as a basis. The Council set the
valuation this year. at $4,700,000. but
the company contends their plant is
worth JR. 500. 000. The company wants
that amount taken as the basis for
fixing the rates, hence the application
for an injunction.
When the case was called the com
pany secured an order from the court
to compel the defendant to furnish to
the plaintiff all the data that was used
to arrive at the rates fixed by ' the
Council in May. In the afternoon it
gained another point by securing the
admission of affidavits supplementary
to the bill of complaint.

I know of no Institution which does Â«o
much good without doing: any Injury In the
community. Seven hundred boys were ad- !

number In the history of the institution. The
people of this city may attest their feeling
of gratitude by attending the excursion next
Saturday, when they may enjoy a delightful
outtnjr and also aid the causÂ» of trus Christian
charity.
The first annual excursion and pic

MORTGAGE C.\' 1'AIRMONT
An attempt was made t r obtain from
the witness a statement regarding the
amount of money paid Mr. Campbell as
special prosecutor, in order to show
animus of the witness. The jury was
dismissed and the question argued at
length. The prosecution contended
that the mere fact that a special prose
cutor was employed was sufficient evi
dence of the Interest of the witness in
the case and that the sum of money
paid him for his services was In no
sense a point for the Jury to consider,
but rather a private business trans-
At the opening of the morning ses
elon, Colonel. Beck, manager of the In
ternational Banking Corporation, re
sumed the stand. He testified as to
the number of: years he had been In
the banking business and as to his
business relations with the firm of Ep
pinger & Co. On cross-examination by
Attorney Ach the witness stated that
he had solicited business from the Ep
pingers, as he thought they would be
good customers. He had made them
one loan prior to that made In April
and the amount had been paid. Dur
ing the course of the examination At
torney Ach was rebuked by the court
for the manner in which he was con
ducting the examination. He ex
plained that there was no intent to
take up the time of the court and the
purport of his questions would develop
later.
ATTORNEY IS REBUKED.
The prosecution in the case of Jacob
Eppinger, charged with obtaining
money on worthless warehouse receipts,
dug into the meat of the case late yes
terday afternoon when the work of
tracing the. course of the receipts and
the disposition of the grain was begun.
W. B. Cutter of the firm of Cutter &
Moseley testified *that he had on De
cember 2, 1902," purchased warehouse
receipts Nos. 706, 707, 708 and 709 from
M. Blum & Co. -n December 4 he sent
these receipts to Eppinger & Co. with
the following letter:
Enclosed find warehouse receipts covering
lots 700. 707. 708 and 709. which please tele
phone to Port Costa to deliver on the French
bark Pierre Lotl. Your immediate attention
will oblige, as we would like to get started
early this morning so as to get finished. Ke
spectfully, CUTTER & MOSEL.EY.
Two of the lots mentioned are those
which the indictment charges Jacob
Eppinger with having borrowed upon
in April of 1903. In order to follow up
the transaction, Hugh McFaul, a
weigher employed In the warehouse at
Crockett, testified that he had weighed
the grain mentioned In the hypothecat
ed receipts and seen it loaded on the
bark Pierre Loti during the month of
December, 1902.* He also jaw the ves
sel sail away with the grain in her
hold. .vV Â¦Â¦*.Â¦.;?â¢'â¢â¢Â¦. . : - 'Â¦Â¦'-:
The board approved the map of Â¦ the
assessment district for changes of
grades on Greenwich street, between
Hyde and Larkin.
City Engineer Woodward reported
that the cost of grading all cross
streets between Twenty-sixth and
Army streets, from Alabama street to
San Bruno road, Is far in excess of
one-half of the assessed value of prop
erty liable therefor and that the work
cannot be done und$r public contract.
The Civil Service Commission sent a
request that general information be
furnished by the board regarding the
qualifications of civil service eligibles
for street sweepers, with a view to hold-
Ing an examination therefor. * The
Merchants' Association asked that the
present sweepers have an equal chance
In the preparation of the eligible list.
The commission also asked to be ad
vised how many superintendents,
assistant superintendents, inspectors
and foremen will be needed for the
municipal street cleaning plant. Presi
dent Schmitz was authorized to confer
with the commission.
M. L. Schmitt ug/ped that a uniform
width for brick walls in buildings.be
adopted. Schmitt wanted the width
fixed at thirteen inches, which, he said.
was acceptable to the Fire Depart
ment^ He was instructed to file a peti
tion on the subject, so that the build-
Ing ordinance may be amended by the
Supervisors.
The board approved the specifica
tions for water works for the new
pesthouse and asked the Supervisors
for authority to enter into a contract
therefor.
City Engineer Woodward reported
that Thirty-second avenue South, from
d street to the water, line,' about 350
feet, is private property and that a
fence thereon is not an obstruction.
Contracts were awarded yesterday
by the Board of Public Works to
Frank McSheehy for additions to the
Dudley Stone School building at $12,
492, and for additions to the Lowell
High School building at $2240.
Bids were opened for making cer
tain additions to the Richmond School
building. Fred C. Jones' bid was $21,
450 and- the Deneen Building Com
pany's $18,000. The contract will be
awarded to the latter after the Board
of Education has passed on the mat
ter.
