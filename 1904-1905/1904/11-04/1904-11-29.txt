COPENHAGEN, Nov. 28.â Herr
Cludestadt, a well known banker, and
other prominent Jews have formed an
organization to assist the Russian
Jews in emigrating to America
through Danish ports. Funds are be
ing collected to facilitate their passage
and to give the emigrants a start in
life on their -arrival at their destina

of these emigrants left Denmark dur
ing the present year. The traffic is
becoming so large at Scandinavian
ports that the Hamburg-American
Steamship Company Is . arranging a
new service to Copenhagen, Gothen
burg, Christlania and the westei-n
coast of Norway, supplementary to its
regular service to America.

"It is believed about headquarters
that the Japanese will make extraor

befor<#the arrival of the Russian sec

"Severe measures have been taken
against marauders. Twelve Cossacks
of one regiment were sentenced to
death. One was shot in front of the
brigade, while the sentences of the re
maining eleven were commuted to
penal servitude. Discipline generally
is good. Patriarchal relations exist
between the officers and men and the
former are doing everything possible
for the latter."

SEOUL, Nov. 28. â Japanese prepa
rations against possible contingencies
and the determination of Japan to
prevent the Russians obtaining a
foothold on Korean sofl are evidenced
by a report from the Governor of
Quelpart, an Island off the southwest

load of Japanese workmen, with tools
and machinery, were landed and im
mediately began the construction of
fortifications.
The Korean Foreign Office an
nounces that Quelpart is closed to
alien residence, according to treaty
stipulations, and therefore it re

mbre% importance.; " Both charges . are
Â¦trlviar to .Weber, -judging by^ his con
duct since his arrest. He has been as
cool as an. iceberg, at all times, even
when the pistol which he was supposed
to have used in his - awful crime was
suddenly placed before him; cool even
x w hen, he '.was told .the money he was
supposed to have stolen from, the '.bank
was foundon the property of his father,
near where the bloody pistol that dealt
death to Julius, Mary, Bertha and Earl
Weber was found. : , r " Â«
- Sheriff Â¦ Keena- was ; therefore not
greatly- surprised when he en
tered the youth's cell and learned from
him that he, considered the bank rob
bery a "trivial matter-" But : young
Weber will -learn ; that -it-is not such a
trivial matter, for his carelessly, uttered
vords have | given the . Sheriff : a new
theory to w6rk upon.
.-"I "did It to see how far I could go."

( many ;â¢ since j the, arrest of Weber and

i AUBURN, Nov. 28.â "I know, nothing
abqut^'this bank robbery. It is U>e-in^
significant to about. If I did rob
the bank I did it just to see how far
I could go.: By this I do not- mean to
say that I committed the- robbery."
.These are the words of young Adolph
Weber, who rests under the charge
Weber has, a habit of answering a
question, by /asking another. 'To-day
Under Sheriff May asked him if he ever
owned a pistol. Weber replied "No."
' ."Did:. vou ./ever see this one?" asked
May, .exhibiting the weapon the bank
robber left behind.
; "I never did," was the reply.
"How. much did you pay for It, any
way, Adolph?" said May.
"How much; did you pay. for it,
Billy?" was the quick retort. .

This idea will be worked on by Sher

already convinced of Weber's guilt, but
they are still working, to proVide a
motive. Everything advanced will be
well threshed out before it is dropped.

ST. PETERSBURG, &ov. 28.â Russia
has accepted the invitation of the
j United States to conclude an arbitra
tion treaty on the lines of the Amer
ican-French treaty.
The American proposal was sub
mitted to Russia in the form of a note
from Secretary Hay, which was pre
sented personally to Foreign Secretary
Lamsddrff by Charge d'Affaires Eddy
on November 21.' This afternoon Count
Lamsdorff replied, accepting in prin
ciple in behalf of the Imperial Govern
ment the text of the treaty, but indi
xating that Russia would propose some
slight modifications. These are ex
pected to be drafted in a few days and
the final consummation of the new
rapprochement with Russia will not
long be delayed.
Although it was known that the
American Government was desirous of
negotiating arbitration treaties with all
the principal powers, the fact that Rus
sia had already been approached with
a direct proposition did not leak out
until Count Lamsdorff had accepted it.
The rapprochement is expected to have
a splendid effect on Russian-American
relations, especially as It marks Rus
sia'B first adherence to an arbitration
treaty with a foreign power.

TOKIO, Nov. 29. â Opinion ' as to
the action of the British In supplying
coal to vessels of the Russian fleet haÂ«
not been formed, because the facts
and details are not yet known. No
comment has yet been made by the
prera.' It is understood that the
question has not yet been raised dip
lomatically. The formal ..opening -of
the Diet will take place to-morrow.
Innumerable attempts, news of which
has been withheld by the railway au
thorities, have been made to wreck dif
ferent trains, but the watchout has
been so sharp that many of these have
been frustrated. For weeks when the
disasters have been at their highest
every bridge on the western line was
watched, the railway companies fearing
that they would be "blown up. Bank
hold-ups have been extraordinarily nu
merous during the past two months,
and these are all attributed to the men
who tried by threats to blackmail two
great Canadian railroads.
The first of these took place on Sep
tember 1, when the train conveying
Lord Minto, the late Governor General
of Canada, and party, was wrecked.
Five persons were killed outright and
many others were 'injured.
On September ,ll_the. Canadian Pa
cific transcontinental train was held up
by armed men at Mission Junction, B.
C, and booty to the extent of several
thousands of dollar's was taken. This
was the first train hold-up In the his
tory Â«f the Canadian railroads.
Greater efforts than before were made
to run down the gang, but although
these have been continued ever since
nothing has been effected, and wrecks
and hold-ups of an endless number,
some involving loss of life, but others
not so serious, have been committed
under th'e very noses of the detectives.
FIVE KILLED IX WRECK.
Another conference between-the offi
cials of both railways resulted, and it
was again decided to Ignore the men's
requests, and make an even more
searching Investigation into the mat
ter. In the latter part of August a third
letter was received.
"We have written you orice before on
this matter, but it seems that you are
ignoring, us. It seems that you are not
aware of the fact that you are dealing
with men who know their business, and
as we take you to be a business man
you will readily see our supremacy in
this matter, and unless you agree to
our terms trains will be interfered
with."
On receipt of the letters the executive
agents of the two railways held a joint
meeting. After a short discussion it
was decided not to take any notice of
the demand. However, extra â¢ precau
tions were taken and special- service
men were sent out with each train and
a vigilant eye was kept on the tracks
On August 17 both railway officials
again received similar communications.
They read as follows:
EXTRA PRECAUTIONS TAKEN.
"We are in need of $100,000 and have
decided , to hold ufc,< thelC;" P,* and "' C." N.
to the tune of $50,000 each. â¢ If. you de
cide, to. treat with us. you -will place'on
your 'south' train white markers instead
of. green." "
WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Nov. 28.â
Foiled in an attempt to secure 5100,000
by blackmailing the Canadian Pacific
and Canadian Northern railways, an
organized gang of desperadoes is now
fulfilling threats to blow up the various
lines at different points throughout the
Canadian Northwest. The police au
thorities also attribute several hold-ups
and similar outrages which have been
committed during the past two months
to these men. So successful have they
been and so completely have they hid
den all trace of their identity that travl
eling by rail has now become danger
ous, and the country is in a state of
terror as to what desperate detNi will
next be attempted.
On August 4 G. J. Bury, general su
perintendent of the Canadian Pacific
Railway, and E. A. James, general
manager of the Canadian Northern
Railway here, both received the follow
ing letter. The words were printed In
ink and the postmark was Winnipeg.: It

The Southeastern lines started the
quarrel several years ago by demand

believed they were entitled to. During
the last two vears three meetings have
been called in the hope that the diffi

agreement reached which would be
satisfacory to all persons concerned.
The last meeting was held in Chi

agree. The breaking off of connections
comes as a result.
"The. transcontinental lines have ben
drawn into this against their wishes,"
said an official of one of the big sys

Evidence describing the manner of
apprehension and arrest of Puter and
Mrs. Watson by the United States
secret service was Introduced and court
adjourned until to-morrow.
PORTLAND, Nov. 28.â William A.
Richards, Commissioner of the General
Land Office, arrived here to-day to tes
tjfy In the land frauds case of the Gov
ernment against S. A. D. Puter, Horace
G- MeKinley.and others. Richards de
clined to be interviewed; upon the pur
pose' of his visit here. 'It is expected
he will .go on the witness stand to
morrow. '-'â¢-
Miss Ella Wyman, the proprietor of
a small hotel on Dearborn avenue in
Chicago, testified; that Puter and Mrs.
W&tson came to her hotel' March" 30
and asked for rooms. "I asked them
for references," continued the "witness,
"and they said they had Just reached
the city and could not give any. They
gave their names as Mr. and MrsJ Pot
ter and he said he was in the mining
business."
J. H. Booth of Roseburg, Receiver of
the Roseburg Land Office, was next
called. He identified papers submitted
by the prosecution as an application
of George A. Howe for selection of lieu
land from base in township 11 south of
range 7. These papers were also iden
tified by Speciallnspector A. R. Green
and H. J. Coleman and George R.
Ogden, land office clerks.
The court admitted the evidence. The
prosecution then introduced a deed
from George A. Howe to Horace G.
McKinley, which was witnessed -*by
Dan W. Tarpley and transferred a part
of the land acquired under the preced
ing transaction.
Upon the objection of the defense
Hall stated that he wished to show by
the introduction of "the deeds from the
seven homesteaders whose patents had
just been offered in evidence that the
claims had all been transferred to
Howe, who was a fictitious person.
"By this testimony," said Hall, "I
will show these conspirators under an
other name."
A. S. Dresser, Register of the Oregon
City land office, produced the original
patents issued in the cases of Mattie
S. Lowell, William McLaughlin, A. O.
Austin, -JT. R. Foster, James Wakefleld,
Christie E. Langham and James A.
Taylor and a certified copy of a deed
to George A. Howe from William Mc-
Laughlin.
Then came the reading of the report
in regard to Frank Wolgamot, detail
ing how he had erected a house of
8xl'O feet, with a woodshed; how he
cleared five acres of land and beauti
fied the premises with a small garden.
The evidence then reverted to the let
ter written by United States Senator
Mitchell and accompanying some affi
davits of Puter and Mrs. Watson to
the General Land Office. Ogden identi
fied these. Cross-examination develop
ed no new features and the witness was
dismissed.
When court opened to-day the Gov
ernment recalled George R. Ogden, a
clerk in the General Land Office, who
identified the report submitted by C. E.
Loomis, with reference to the home-
EU-ad of Thomas Wilkin.
PORTLAND, Nov. 28.â To-day devel
oped a surprise in the trial of the" land
fraud ca?es. There was brought* into
the cage the name -of George A. Howe,
to whom was deeded seven of the" al
leged bogus homestead titles. Further
documentary evidence brought to light
that Howe had in turn deeded to Hor
ace G. McKinley a tract of land in
section 15 south, range 1 east. District
Attorney Hall announced to the court
that the Government would prove that
Howe is in reality one of the conspira
tors under another name.

up by two masked men and robbed of
all his money. Geiser was crossing
the street at Twenty-third and K
streets when a man suddenly stepped
out from behind a tree and, covering
him with a revolver, ordered him to
hold up his hands. At the same time
another man came up behind him
and pressed the muzzle of a pistol
against his neck.
This is the second hold-up within
a year that has occurred at the same
spot. At Twenty-third and K streets
there are no lights and the large
trees in the vicinity make the spot a
particularly dangerous one at night.

"The belief is general that Port Ar

be delayed. Much is expected from the
second Pacific squadron.
"General Kuropatkin is not talkative.
The only reference he made to the war
in conversation with me was, 'It is pro
gressing as' I wish.' The general still
lives in a railway car, and the light In
his office is burning night and day. It
Is commonly stated that he never
sleeps, and his officers are not surprised
when they are called into conference at
any hour of the night.
"The general's only relaxation is at
dinner time, when he always. has sev
eral officers as guestsâ sometimes a
score of them. "Wine Is plentiful, but
General Kuropatkin drinks only min
eral water. Every officer seems to have
unlimited money, the Government be
ing lavish in this respect.
"My opinion is that Kuropatkin will
never retreat to Mukden unless defeat
ed decisively, and I think that the next
battle will end in a Russian victory."
"The Russians are imDroving in the
handling of their artillery, while*- the
Japanese artillery seems to be less ef
fective. Originally the Russians, did riot
conceal their artillery, which the Japa
nese quickly disabled. Now they handle
and conceal their guns in aÂ» scientific
manner.
CHEFU, Nov. 28.â General. Kuropat-.
kin Is the possessor of a new twenty
horsepower automobile, with"' which he
is able to rush at high speed from one
part to another of a line twenty- five
miles long, according to Â¦ a Frenchman
{ interested in the manufacture and sale
of automobiles who has just reached
Chefu from Mukden. This gentleman
spent three weeks with General Kuro
patkin, who wished to procure twenty
automobiles specially constructed to
carry ammunition speedily in emergen
cies. These will be used only In winter,
Avhen the Manchurian roads are gener
ally in excellent condition. On his first
trip in the automobile General Kuro
patkin's only comment was: '_
"I have an advantage over General
Shatter."
The Chinese now regard the Russian
commander in his machine- with super
stitious awe, believing the automobile
to be an atrociously powerful specimen
of the "foreign devil." The French in
formant continued:
"The two armies lie facing each oth
er, each having three fortified lines.
The soldiers of both armies live mostly
in caves behind- the trenches, which
when covered with snow present the
appearance of a great host of polar
bears waiting to spring at each other.
These caves are warm, even ' when
without fires. The Russian soldiers are
in the best of spirits and have unlim
ited confidence in their leaders' They
expect t*hat General Kuropatkin will at
tack during the winter. The Russian
force now numbers 300,000 men.
"The cavalrymen from the Don dis
trict are superior to their Siberian com
rades. They are intelligent, brave and
active and are mounted on fine and
powerful horses.
"There are only a few hundred wound
ed at Mukden, but there are 30,000 at
Harbin. -
"I came out on the Siberian Railroad,
which seemed to be doing a tremendous '
work smoothly. Along" the railroad be- }
tween Mukden and Harbin there are j
lines of warehouses full of supplies, and j
these supplies remain almost untouched, J
as up to the present the army has sub- j
sisted chiefly on the country. j
SCARES CHINESE
It Is to be observed, further, that while there
is no finding of . fact in this case unon which
the order of the commission can be based, the
evidence itself is not believed to be sufficient
to support the order. The evidence before â¢ the
court, on the contrary appears to tjp sufficient
to support a finding that the Kearney 'rate in
and Â£ of Itself wei and Is reasonable. But* In
view - of what has been said â¢ It will not be
necessary to review the evidence UDon tha$
question. ; Nor will it be necessary to con
sider the objection that the order of the com
mission seeks to fix and establish rates, a
legislative power the commission does not pos
sess under the statute. , Interstate Commerce
Commission vs. Alabama Midland Ry. Co.; 108
U. iÂ». 144. 161. Its. Neither will It be neces
sary to discuss the question whether the Union
Pacific Railroad Company , is bound by tho
order of the commission by reason of the fact
that.lt was not originally a party to the com
plaint i before the commission. The conclusion
reached Is that the bill has not been sustained,
for the reason stated, and should be dismissed.
It iÂ» so ordered. . -
It follows that unless the greater charge for
the shorter haul Is In and of Itself unreason
able, and the lesser rote charged for the longer
haul Is voluntary, the prohibition of the third
tfctir.n of the act doea ndt apply: It Is true
that tn this court It in contended that the
rate to Kearney Is unreasonable per se, and in
support of this contention It Is urged that the
unreasonableness of the Kearney rate appears
from the fac; that, although the traffic Is de
livered at Kenrney direct, the Kearney rate
is made ud of thn rate for the haul through
Kearney and 160 miles beyond to Lincoln, a
competitive point, nlus the local rate of 27
cents per 100 pounds from Lincoln back, to
Kearney, and that the Kearney, rate embraces
charges for tv.-o hauls .aggregating 300 miles
not In fact made. The attention of 'the court
Is also called to a statement or the average
castbeund rate per ton per mile maintained
by the Union Pacific Railroad Company on
Pacific Coast business for a number of years,
from which it appears that the local rate of
27 cente per 100 pounds from Lincoln to Kear
ney la In excess of such average rate. But
after it has been determined that Omaha is
an active competitive point, and the rate to
that point has been reduced by competition,
this argument does not supply the place of a
finding by the commission upon evidence be
fore it that the rate of 77 cents per 100 pounds
from Â¦ San Francinco Â¦ to Kearney Is in and of
Itself unreasonable. -This was the defect in
the proceedings before the commission In the
case of Interatate Commission vs. Louisville,
etc.. R. R. Co., 190 U. S. 273. where the
Supreme Court pointed out that there was
nothing In the proceeding to sustain the view
that the commission had adjudged that the
higher rates for the shorter hauls were In and
of themselves unreasonable. Irrespective of the
competitive conditions prevailing at a. point
on the longer haul where a lesser charge had
been established by force of competitive con
ditions, -r .. -
Judge Morrow, after quoting the
cases of Texas and Pacific Rail
way vs. Interstate Commerce Commis
sion and East Tennessee Railway
Company vs. Interstate Commerce
Commission, says:';.
On December 9, IS90, A. J. Gustin, a
resident of Kearney, Nebr., filed a pe
tition with the Interstate Commerce
Commission alleging that the South
ern Pacific Company, Union Pacific
Railway Company and its successor,
the Union Pacific Railroad Company,
had violated the interstate commerce
act, in that they had charged a rate
of 77 cents per 100 pounds on sugar in
carload lots from San Francisco over
their joint through line to Kearney,
Nebr, while at the same time charging
50 cents per 100 pounds on the same
freight for the longer haul through
Kearney to Omaha. On March 3, 1900,
the commission found the charges com
plained of to be in violation of the act
and ordered that the defendants desist
from making them.
It is alleged in the. present suit that
the defendants willfully violated this
order of the commission. The commis
sion asked for a writ of injunction or
other process restraining defendants
from further disobedience to the order
and requiring them to pay the costs
and counsel fees. The defendant rail
way companies filed answers admit
ting that they had charged the rate
mentioned, but- denying, that it was in
violation of 'law, ' alleging that the
lower rate t to Omaha (tHan to Kearney,
was forced 1 ; upon them. by competitive
conditions beyond , their control, name
ly, water and rail; rates through the
Dominion of Canada and water com
petition-to and from the Atlantic and
gulf ports. : r< '
Judge Morrow said that while the
commission had determined that
Omaha was a competitive point In the
transportation of" sugar, and, that the
defendants were forced to make the
rate of 50 cents per 100 pounds from
*San Francisco to that point,, it did
not determine that the rate of 77 cents
per 100 pounds to Kearney was unrea
sonable per ee, but that it was only
relatively so. In other words, by com
paring the rate of 77 cents per 100
pounds from Han Francisco to Kear
ney, the shorter distance, with the rate
of 1 50 cents per 100 pounds from San
Francisco to Omaha, the longer dis
tance; the commission reached the con
clusion that the greater charge for
the shorter distance was relatively un
reasonable. The question had been
submitted to the court whether this
difference of 27 cents per 100 pounds
between the rates to Kearney and
Omaha was unreasonable. ; >fe';
The famous sugar rate case, which
had been pending in the Federal
courts for . several years, was dis
missed yesterday by United States
"Circuit Judge Morrow! In his
opinion Judge â¢ Morrow exhaustively
discusses the ense and decides that
the Interstate Commerce, Commission
is not vested with legislative ;. powers
to' establish- rates and that it had not
been shown that* thV rate complained
of on sugar from San Francisco ;to
Kearney, Nebr.,. was unreasonable per
se. The suit, was; entitled The Inter
state Commerce I Commission vs.- the
Southern Pacific Company, the" Union
Pacific Railway Company and S. H.
B. Clark, Oliver \W.) Mink, E. .^EUery
Anderson. John W. Doane and Freder
ick R. Coudert, as receiver of. the
Union. Pacific Railway Company, and
the Union Pacific Railroad 'Â¦ Company
as successor, of the Union Pacific"Rail
way Company. 1 ; ,. ; ;
This was a suit in equity to restrain
the defendants from collecting certain
freight charges on sugar in violation
of the. order of the Interstate Com
merce Commission." The facts of the
case, as found by Judge Morrow, are
as follows: .
The Japanese attack on Tsinkha
cheri was checked by our artillery fire
and the fighting ceased at 6 o'clock in
the evening of November 27. At no
point did the enemy advance nearer
than vithin 600 paces of our positions.
A later dispatch fnwi General Kuro
patkin reports that the night of No
vember*'^ passed quietly at Tsinkha
chen, but that the Japanese resumed
the offensive at 7 o'clock this morning
on the Russian left flank.
General Sakharoff to-day telegraphed
djs follows:
General Kuropatkin, under yester
days date, reported that the Japanese
offensive movement, which was begun
en November 24, near the village of
Tsinkhaohen. on the front of the left
Hank, was of an indecisive character
uj) to 4 o'clock on November 26, and
was checked by the Russian fire. Al
though the fighting had then lasted
three days the Russian troops were in
Â«-^:ceIlent spirits.
ATTACK IS RESUMED.
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 28.âGen
eral Kuropatkin reports that there has
been active skirmishing on the left
flank for three days. The opinion is
uow expressed by the general staff
that the Japanese intend taking the
offensive, as -hey cannot afford to wait
till the Russians are further reinforced.
It is held that the fighting to the east
ward is doubtless with the purpose of
feeling out the Russian positions, pre
paratory to an advance in that! direc
tion, but as there are about 7000 Rus
sian troops southwest of Sintsintin,
where fighting occurred on November
26, and probably twice as many more
in the mountains between Bentziaputze
and Sintsintin a Japanese move from
this quarter would entaii serious fight
ing.
LONDON, Nov. 29. â Generals Kuro
patkin and Sakharoff are sending daily
long detailed accounts of apparently
rather unimportant fighting which
may, however, possibly turn out to be
the beginning of another great battle
deciding the fate of Mukden. ' Japan
ese in London decline to believe that
there will be a cessation of hostilities
till spring.
ODESSA, Nov. 28.â General Kaul
bars, commander of the Third Man
churian army, left Odessa , to-day for
Mukden, where he expects to arrive on
December 14.
MUKDEN, Nov. 28.â Undue import
ance is attached to the three days'
fight between the Japanese and Gen
eral Rennenkampf's men. It was in
reality an advance guard affair, in
which the Japanese were repulsed with
a loss of 100 men. This advance of
the Japanese against Pa Pass need not
be regarded as a big flanking move
ment toward Tie Pass, which so many
imagine is the route the. Japanese" in
tend to take- Both the Japanese armies
are united near Mukden and as here
tofore are simply awaiting develop
ments.
WITH THE RUSSIAN FORCES AT
SHENKINQ, Nov. 28.â The attack by
the Japanese upon General Rennen
kampf's position on November 24 re
sulted in three days' fighting at Tslnk
hachen. near Da Pass. Though the
Japanese have been repulsed the fight
ing continues. The Japanese have suc
ceeded in placing several big siege guns
in position, with which they will be
able to seriously harass the Russians.
NOT A GENERAL ENGAGEMENT.
In the midst of the battle a blinding
snowstorm caused a suspension of hos
tilities and when the weather cleared
at 3 o'clock in the afternoon a turning
movement against our right flank was
observed."

SCOTTS EMULSION.
HAD TO HIDE IT
. A mother wrote us recently
that she had to keep Scott's
Emulsion under lock and key
â her children used to drink
it whenever her back was
turned. Strange that children
should like something that is
so good for them. It's usu-
ally the other way. Scott's
Emulsion makes children
comfortable, makes them fat
and rosy-cheeked. Perhaps
that's why they like it so
much â they know it mjtkes
them feel good.

"It is very gratifying to the people
of Mississippi to know that they have

telegram from President Francis of

last trip she expressed a desire to
well-known citizen's -of Milwaukee to
paint a picture of President Roosevelt
for the White House, or to be hung
in one of theother Government build
ings at Washington. She was directed
to seek an audience through one of
the Wisconsin Senators or Congress
men.
Miss Herndl was released at the po
lice station after having been ques
tioned at length and satisfying the au
thorities that she meant r!o harm to
the President. To-night she stated
that she has a painting of George
Washington displayed in the Varied
Industries Pavilion and was very anx
ious that it be viewed by President
Roosevelt. When he failed to. see ft

VARDAMAN TAKES ANOTHER
FLING AT THE PRESIDENT
The first attempt was made on the
second section of No. 5, known as the
California Limited. This was not re
ported to headquarters Saturday
jiight, as the train crew thought the
shots fired into the cab came from
gruns in the hands of persons who
wished to be revenged on the railroad
for either a fancied or real cause.
Some of the trainmen ftlll cling to the
revenge theory, but others hold that
a gang of train robbers is operating in
Chaffee County.
Of the two shots fired at No. 5 one
plowed its way through the cap of
Fireman Arthur and tore a tuft of
hair away.

SAN JOSE, Nov. 28.â Sixty em
ployes of the livery stables In this city
walked out this morning at 9 o'clock.
The trouble { Is due to the wage scale.
The men have been paid $2 a day for
the last two years. A short time ago
the employers formed an association
and notified the men that during the
winter months they would have to cut
wages from $60 to $50 per month.
This was to go Into effect December 1
and continue until May 1. The Stable
men's Union refused; to accept this
and to-day ordered their men on
strike. Every stable but one in the
city was effected.
Stable owners stated this afternoon
that they have had no trouble filling
the places of the strikers and that
they have been obliged to turn away
many applicants for work.

They seem to be less conscious of self,

LONG BEACH. Nov. 28.â The resi
dence of A. M. Goodhue, manager of
tÂ£<? San Pedro Lumber Company, was
looted by burglars last night in so cora
plet* a manner that the place will prac-
Uc&ily have to be refurnished. Almost
everything which two men could move
was taken, and the tbooty includes in
addition to many valuable trinkets all
the bedding, table and other linen,
dreeses, clothing, articles of furniture,
table cutleryâ In short, practically all
that a discriminating thief who desires
to furnish a house would take.
The burglars used a wagon to haul
away their plunder, and although the
vehicle was seen on the streets before
daylight this morning no trace of it
can now be found by the officers. The
Coodhue family was away from home.
The thieves therefore had the entire
right In which to work.
The residence adjoins that of Fire
Chief Shrewsbury, but he heard no
noise during the night.
The home of Mrs. J. B. Webster, a
short distance away, was also looted In
an almost identical manner, the thieves
taking even the mattresses from the
beds.
This makes seven such burglaries
here within three weeks, the burglars
In each case selecting a house from
which the family was absent.

DOAN'S YYVL&.
A GREATJRUTH.
How It Eas Spread From Home to
Home in San Francisco.
In every part of San Francisco, in ;
the homes of the wealthy, in the i
humble abode of the man of toil, 'tis i
now a well-known fact â a great truth i
â that Doan's Kidney Pills have ;
brought more comfort to backache !
sufferers and cured more sick kidneys j
than any medicine of modern time.
John Lewis, tailor, rear of 721 j
Bush street, says: "An attack of ma- 1
laria, as in the majority of instances,
was followed by inactivity of the kid-
neys and a lameness and soreness â¢
across the small of v\y back. Sitting, 'Â¦
as I am compelled to do, partially
stooped, strained the muscles of the :
loins, and aching ensued, and when I ;
straightened I could only describe the !
twinges which shot through the small j
of my back as excruciating. With
the passing of time the pain increased j
until I was compelled to stop work.
I knew something had to be done or :
my case might become serious, and I i
commenced taking standard remedies â¢
guaranteed to cure kidney complaint j
in any of its various forms. The re- i
suits obtained from the medicines '
ceased the moment I stopped their use,
and, ever on the outlook for some-
thing to bring relief, I at last tried
Doan's Kidney PiHs. I knew after
a dose or two they were acting di-
rectly upon the kidneys, and a con-
tinuation of the treatment absolutely
stopped the last attack. I have told
a great many of my friends and ac-
quaintances about the benefit I have
received from the use of Doan's Kid-
ney Pills."

Want to Save $200, and ;
Have Got the 3ioney:
For this great "sacrifice sale of Web-
er pianos for spot cash" closes at 10:30
to-morrow night, and you've no tixna
to lose. â¢ *;
Having cut the "Weber down an aver- \
age of more than 5200 each below their
retail price, we have gone the limit,
and are at a loss to know what to say
â But there is one thing we do know,
and that la. that it will be many a
long day. if ever, before the good peo-
ple of this city will again face a likÂ»
opportunity to buy a strictly first-class
piano without lining up some dealer's
pocket with a profit.
"Vye know another thingâ That thosa
who may be holding back in hopes ofi
a further cut in price, are waiting ia
vain, for we are at the -oottom, abso-* j
lutely at the bottom, there's nothing â¢
more to cut. }
If discounting J200 from the regular
price of such a piano as the celebrated,
Weberâ a piano known throughout tho
civilized world as one of the "four great
American leaders* 1 â putting it down to
the price of a piano more than $200 be-
neath Its class, won't sell the remaining j
few fine "Webers by to-morrow night,
we'll have something good left over to
sell at a profit, which won't be so ba3 i
after all.â But if you think business,
think fast, for Webers will be a pretty
expensive article after this sale Is over.
Don't waste time telephoning but grab
your check or. pocket book, and meet
us face to face, and you may hear
sweet sounds at home to-night.

The large stores will sell only a lim
ited amount of meat to each individ
ual. Throughout the district precau
tions are being taken . to prevent the
breaking out of scurvy. ' Hunters- are
making small -fortunes , by shooting
ptarmigan and -other wild game. These
are abundant in the hills, not far dis
tant, and sell readily at $1 50 a pound.
.The hunters will make more this win
ter than the majority of miners.
Cariboo and moose meat will be plen
tiful, It is expected, before the winter
ends. Many of the cattle, slaughtered
at Fairbanks near the close of the sea
son were shipped In. byway of Lynn
canal down the Yukon ,to Circle, City,
and thence driven acrO6s .to Fair
banks. Some of the cattle were driven
in from Valdez, and the first cattle to
reach Tanana next year will be driven
in over that route.
: TAC0MA, Nov. 28.â Meat is so scarce
in the Tanana mining district that
along a majority of the creeks miners
are eating meat only once per week.
When navigation closed nearly two
months ago the entire carnp had for its
winter supply only four hundred' beef
carcasses, some pork and some canned
meat. A large quantity of meat failed
to arrive, from both Dawson and- St.

CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTO^N,
WASHINGTON, Nov. 28.â President
Roosevelt on his. return from St. Louis
to-morrow will find himself confronted
by opposition from influential members
of Congress to' revision of" the tariff, so
formidable that it can be overcome, only
by a determined executive and.prob
ably after a long campaign. ',
Speaker Cannon, whose views are'ex
pected to have great effect on the ac
tion of the President, arrived here to
day and made It' clear that he Is op
posed to tariff revision. The position of
the. Speaker has been progressive. Lika
.the President, he desired to wait until
after the election before making a pro
gramme.'' More Jhan a week ago he
caused it to 'become known â¢ that â¢ he
did' not favor the Idea of an extra.ses
sion . for the purpose of tariff revision.
Now he opposes tariff revision, wheth
er at an extra session or at the regular
session.' He has progressed to 'an atti
tude opposite to" that of Mr. Roosevelt,
who wants some schedules changed.
. Senator Hale of Maine gave out an
interview to-day in which he declared
that he would oppose vigorously all re
vision of the tariff,- and accepted the
challenge of the men &ho wanted low
er schedules. He even went so far as to
say that any persistent demand for re
vision wbuld be likely to make a dan
gerous break in the Republican party.
The canvass of. the votes In Denver
and Pueblo counties has not -yet been
completed, but from the unofficial re
turns it : appears that the Democrats
will control the Senate by a majority of
two or three unless the State . Canvass
ing i Board throws out two . or more of
the Democrats who arÂ« apparently
elected.
DENVER, Nov. 28.â Mrs. Rosa Sny
der was arrested to-day on warrants
charging her with having bought votes
at the late election. Lizzie Cummlngs
and other women have made affidavits
that Mrs. Snyder gave them %&Â¦ each
to vote the Republican ticket Mrs.
Snyder Is a complainant' in one of the
cases against Democrats arrested on
warrants Issued by United States Com
missioner Capron charging conspiracy
to intimidate voters, in violation of
Federal statutes. These cases came up
ln'Commissloner Capron's court to-day,,
but were continued,' although George
Allen Smith, attorney for the defend
ants, demanded an immediate trial, de
claring that "these suits were brought
simply for political purposes and -not
for purposes of justice."
Governor-elect Alva Adams came to
Denver from his home in Pueblo to-day
and will remain until after the banquet
to be given in his. honor to-morrow
night. Â¦ He .does not take the threat of
the Republicans to prevent his acces
sion to the Governorship seriously, and
has rented a house here for the two
years of his term. Adams expressed
the opinion to-day that Governor Pea
body after an investigation of the elec
tion returns would reach the conclu
sion that he was not the people's choice
for Governor and would gracefully re
tire. I
It is announced that Governor Pea
body will appoint the two additional
Justices of the Supreme Oourt. Under
the constitutional amendment adopted
at the recent election the Court of Ap
peals and the Supreme Court will, be
consolidated on April 5 next, and two
of the seven Judges are to be named
by the Governor. Governor Peabody
will .make the appointments, and the
Senate if Republican will confirm them.
Should the Democrats control the'Sen
ate.. Governor Peabody's appointments
will be rejected and Governor Adams
will appoint the two Judges.

An unofficial peril of the discharged

were for "Nan" Patterson's acquittal.
NEW YORK. Nov. 28.â The jury in
the Nan Patterson- murder trial was
discharged' to-day and at the same
time District Attorney Jerome sfrved
notice on Nan Patterson's . counsel
that a new Jury would be selected and
a retrial begun at the term of court
whieh will open onÂ© week from to^
day.
The illness of Edward Dressier, a
juror, who was stricken with apoplexy
last week, was the cause of to-day's
action. The report of his physicians,
which was made at the opening of
court to-da3\ that the Juror was in no
condition to return to his duties left
Justice Davis no alternative but to
discharge the Jury.
Miss Patterson appeared very much
dejected as etie was led. back to the
Tombs to await the beginning of the
new trial. She is said to be on the
verge of nervous collapse. When the
adjournment was ordered she ex
pressed keen i disappointment. She
had been confident, she- Said, that the
jury would discharge her, and she was
satisfied that a few days more. would

BERLIN, Nov. 28.â^The publication
on the eve of the opening of the
Reichstag, which will convene this
afternoon, of the Government's pro
posals to Increase the peace footing of
the army by 10,000 men, and for defi
nite legislative enactment providing
for two years' service with the colors
in all branches of the army except
cavalry and field artillery, rounds out
a programme which the imperial rep
resentatives are not likely to dispose
of before ; the Christmas adjournment,
even "without discussion of commercial
treaties,' v hich the Government is not
ready to submit.
4 The substance of the military pro
posals !ls:so well known, and the pro
posed; increase of the army is so slight
compared with the increase of popu
lation', : that the newspapers print the
text Â¦ of the proposed law with little
save, explanatory comment. The same
is true of the bill definitely committing
the/ Government to the two years' ser
vice plan after- eleven years of experi
ence. T>r more comment is evoked
by the growing yearly increase of the
national debt, as shown by the budget
proposals.
Germain had been "boozing." In an
endeavor to give^ his muddied brain a
purer atmosphere he attempted to open
the window overlooking the street. For
a few moments he struggled with the
obstinate sash and, .his arm went
through, the glass.sending a shower of
the broken pane on the heads of pedes
trians. A crowd' attracted by the noise
gathered and. stared a't the man and
the window. While they gazed.Ger
main's efforts were' rewarded by the
giving way . of the window. With a
crash both sash.and man fell forty feet
to the" pavement- below. ThÂ» crowd
held its breath in horror. -
The nimble Frenchman, only dazed
by the impact, rose to his feet in time
to receive his frantic wife in his arms.
The situation was too much for Frank
and the two rolled over amid a volume
of s French phrases. . Then Germain
went out of "business.
The ambulance 'came: Dr.. Hill treat
ed the injured man at the Central
Emergency Hospital and found him
very little injured. The diagnosis was
"possible, internal- injuries." Germain,
jag and injuries were put to bed. Last
night the man lay "awake figuring out

peculiar 'effects. .' ..

Johnson took up the testimony of
witness that" whenever Miss Dolbeer
was out of the city they corresponded
with each other. But the answer was
brought forth that only one letter,
which had been introduced in evidence
Bertha Marion Dolbeer for Mis3 Etta
Marion Warrer. that when she had
grown to womanhood she adopted the
name of Marion out of sentiment for
the woman who had been mother and
sister to her. Redick McKee Duperu,
who gave this testimony yesterday,
said that the testatrix had also told
him she was indebted to Miss Warren
more than could ever be repaid, and
the witness expressed the opinion that
the will in which the bulk of the es
tate was bequeathed to the person who
held such strong affection was in itself
proof of soundness of mind. Duperu
declared that "a saner girl never lived."
The day had gone peacefully, gentle
ness and gallantry marking the con
duct of the attorneys in drawing out
the testimony of the fair belles of so
ciety who knew Bertha Dolbeer in her
lifetime and were positive she was
sane, until Duperu was called, and the
finish just as- court adjourned was
electric
Duperu had been a lifelong friend
of the testatrix. They were children
together. During the direct examina
tion he voluntarily interjected the
opinion that one of his strongest rea
sons for believing Miss Dolbeer sane
was the sanity and thoughtfulness in
dicated by the will itself. The state
ment was made with much emphasis
and in tone of voice that was nettling
to counsel for contestant. It could
be seen that a storm was brewing for
the cross-examination and came.
"I would not know what to do with
out Miss Warren," she had exclaimed.
Miss Hager' explained how proficient
Miss Dolbeer was 'at golf," which she
The cross-examination' of j Miss Mary
Josselyn was concluded yesterday morn
ing.' She said she had never, noticed
any signs of depression . In Miss Dol
beer. Miss Genevieve " King ' followed
with testimony to the effect thatthe
testatrix enjoyed her -last -sojourn in
Paris very much, the , witness being
there at the time. Miss King described
the visit of a party, of which Miss Dol
beer was one, to the Arc de Triomphe.
MrsJ Gertrude -Brarider. . Miss Lily
Spreckels, Miss Alice Hager, 'William
P. Horn. John H. Mee and Henry M.
Holbrook testified as to the social'ac
tivities in which Miss Dolbeer Â¦partici
pated up to the' time she left San Fran
cisco, and^all were, positive : her. mind
was sound. To Holbrook, Miss; Dolbeer
had said Miss Warren was her best and
dearest friend, and expressed the hope
that some day she could repay all the
kindnesses her companion had shown
her.'
The attorney's voice had an added
note of sternness as he again put the
question. Duperu would make no va
riation in response other than by tone
of voice, which showed rising anger.
Johnson finally won out and the wit
ness hotly shouted "No," adding that
he had already told the fact of the
matter. The lawyer, instant in conflict,
declared that the witness would have to
answer questions. Both were in high
voice and nettled manner.
Attorney Pillsbury was at last moved
to fake a hand, but his thrust was at
Judge Coffey. "lsn:t it about time we
had a Judge here?" he demanded.
Johnson was quick to suggest rebuke
for such a reflection on thn; court. "I
would not dare to make such a com
ment, but coming from the other side
itâ" . â¢
- ."Seems to be. different," Judge Coffey
interposed smilingly.
The mood of the court was right and
everybody escaped a, lambasting. The
humor of. the" situation appealed to
JudRi? Coffey, and he entertainingly
explained that in comparison with him
self Job was entitled merely to honor
able mention for the highly prized vir
tue of patience.
Johnson will go on -.with the cross
examination of Duperu this morning, it
being' but- barely begun yesterday, and
lively proceedings are expected. - -
OWED MUCH TO MISS WAR R EN.
"Are you %ure that is the only letter
she wrote to you?" Johnson repeated
in the demand for a. specific answer.
The answer of the witness was a
repetition of the former, only in a
higher key.
Johnson wanted to emphasise the fact
that she formerly wrote often when
away from San Francisco, but on her
last trip wrote only once.
"Are you sure that is the only letter
she wrote to you?" he asked.
Â£ "I told Â»you I received one letter,"
was the Impatient answer.

PARIS, Nov. 2?.â The Chamber of
Deputies to-day began the debate on
Finance Minister Rouvier's bill for an
incom.e tax. The measure, which makes
sweeping changes in the fiscal system
and is due largely to the growing
strength of the Socialists, but has the
approval of the Government, suppresses
the present taxes on doors, windovrs
and other personal property, amount
ing to a total of I tO, 000,000. The new
plan contemplates raising $26,400,000 by
taxing individual incomes and 512.000.000
by taxing rentals of real estate. The
tax on incomes. is graduated. Incomes
under $500 be exempted: over $500 the

rate belryy .about 2 per cent on Incomes

she left for Europe and at the -ferry,
where many were on hand to bid her
good-by, she spoke enthusiastically of
the trip and was in hig^i spirits.

WITH PANAMA OFFICIALS
The Board of Supervisors, on the ad
vii-r of the committee, allowed 51100 out
of the urgent necessity fund to pur

compel the Auditor to pay their salaries
as health employes.

the return to the German Bank of 514,-
C02 ol protested taxes for schools and a
hospital.
The Finance Committee rejected two
demands of B. Hayes for $500 and $330
on the cround that his charges for
hauling voting machines are excessive.
"I tell you, Missouri is surely all
right. Gentlemen, I want you to feel
that I very deeply appreciate the re
sponsibilities put upon me by such a
vote as that of November S, three
weeks asro. and so far as in me lies, 1

special train stopped at the station In

Foulke and Miss Foulke, wife and
daughter of former Civil Service Com
missioner Foulke, entered the Presi

Roosevelt chatted with them animat
edly for a couple of minutes. Then,
from the rear platform, President
Roosevelt addressed the considerable
crowd assembled as follows:
"Ladies and Gentlemen: I am very
glad lo see you. I know Richmond of
old. I have always thought highly of
Indiana, ; but during the last three
weeks have had cause to think even
more highly of it.".'
Voice in crowd: "How about Mis
souri?"
Only one stop was made by the Pres
ident's fDecial train between Dennison,
Ohio, and this city.
At Dennison the President was
greeted by a great crowd. The train
pulled into the station shortly before
half -past 4 o'clock, and scores of school
children were in the throng. On the
journey to St. Louis the President was
presented with a raccoon, which is be
ing taken back to Washington. In
some remarks at Dennison the Presi
dent referred to the gift. He said:
"I want to tel! you all good evening
and sav how pleased I am to see you
again and to tell you that the coon is
getting along well. He feeds on every
thing ar.d shows a little inclination to
feed on every man, too. The fair was
a most beautiful and wonderful scene,
and I . am very glad I went. I was
glad to see the fair, but I am still
gladder to see all of you here, the peo
ple of these States and Missouri. I
wish you good night and good luck,
especially' the little folks."

train bearing President Roosavelt to
Washington from St. Louis arrived in

ten minutes later. A large and enthu
siastic crowd was present at the Union

the chief executive when he .appeared
on the platform of the rear car. The
President said:
"I, am pleased to again get to Pitts
burg after an absence of a little over
eighty hours. I have been to St. Louis
to see the fair * and thoroughly en
joyed myself. I have also had the
privilege of greeting American citizens
in the States of Pennsylvania, . Ohio,
Indiana, Illinois and Missouri, which I
appreciated."
A large squad of police and detectives
were lined up on either side of the
train during its stay, and every pre
caution was taken for the President's
safety.

In 1901 the company gave % Wemp!e
a note for $S6.679, with the land as
eccurity for that and other advances
not to exceed $35,000. Six notes cover
in the la\ter sum were given between
September, 1901, and March, 1902.
The plaintiff alleges that three of the
directors in the oil company wÂ«Â»re in
terested in the notes and that their ac
tions were without authority. He also
contends that the directors cannot be
induced to bring a suit to >top the
forecloeure because they are under the
control of Wemple.
A suit to set aside a mortgage on
twenty acres of land in Kern County,
belonging to the Mercedes Oil and De
velopment Company, was begun in the
Superior Court yesterday by A. R.
Tartvater, one of the oil company's
Etockholders. He represents -that the
property is worth about $100,000 and
that the notes secured by it amount
to $170,000, but he questions the au
thority of those who gave â¢ the mort
gage. The action is directed against
the oil company, the Continental In
vestment Company, to which the
mortgage was assigned, E. L. Wemple,
T. f P. Sniers, Matthew Arnold and
Homer Wilson.

Peerless Industrial Company of Wash

resents seven contract holders and it
is alleged that there are more than
2000 contracts outstanding, upon
which the company has received more
than $60,000. It is charged that about
$30,000 of the Bum has been wrongful

Two more get-rich-quick concerns
w"ere yesterday made the objects of
attack by H. F. Hobson. who has
heretofore haled a number of others
into the Superior Court. Representing
twenty-one contract holders, he sues
for the recovery of $45,000. collected
on about 1500 contracts by the Bene
ficial Bond and Security Company. He
also asks for the appointment of a
receiver for the company's assets,
books and records. He alleges that
the business is illegal and fraudulent
and that a large amount of the funds
collected has been misappropriated
by the officers of the concern for their
personal use.
Among other things we are working' for bet

and for snorter hours of labor, because we
want the workingman to 'enjoy come of the

aspire. We do not defend this course, but we
do affirm, with President Hadley of Yale, that
strikes and boycots do good by reminding capi

to be considered in these labor questions.

. News has been received of the death
in Switzerland of Henry Frederick
Teschemacher, whose name is closely
linked with the early history of San
Francisco. In the old days he held the
office first as president of the Board of
Supervisors, and when the consolida
tion act went into effect in 1S62 was
elected the first Mayor of San Fran
cisco. *
Henry F. Teschemacher came to Cal
ifornia on one of his father's vessels in
July, 1S42, when 20 years of age. He was
naturally enthusiastic and soon forced
his way to the front. His abilities were
recognized by all, and after serving
faithfully as president of the Board of
Supervisors he was chosen Mdyor in
1862, being known as the "war Mayor,"
as he held office during the Civil War.
Mr. Teschemacher was the oldest
member of the Paeiflc-Union^Club and
was a charter member of the old Union
Club, formed in 1856. He -was also a
member of Oriental Lodge No. 144, F.
and A. M., and of the California His
torical Sdciety. For many years Mr.
Teschemacher and his wife resided in
Europe. Mrs. Teschemacher died in
Switzerland about a year ago. One son,
Hubert, who was with his father at the
time of his death, survives them.-

The Occident Magazine, a conserva
tive weekly publication edited by sen
iors, prints to-day a leading editorial
advocating the placing of students on
the faculty students" affairs committee,
so that the present "strained rela
tions" which, the magazine says, exist
between the student body and the fac
ulty may be changed for more cordial
feelings. It was the students' affairs
committee that recommended the dis
missal from college of Editor Hale. The
Occident intimates that the commit
tee's action is resented by the students
and has caused "strained relations."
The editorial in question is, in part, as
follows: \
If we had a committee chosen from the stu
dent body to represent it, working in co-op
eration with the students' affairs committee,
there could never be any danger that the lat
ter would act without a full understanding
and sympathy for undergraduate ideas and
ideals. We do not say that this committee has
ever acted :n such a way. but It cannot be
denied that the student body has frequently
expressed antagonism toward those judging It.
This antagonism is unfortunate, for, as was
said in our ftm Jrsue this term. It "weakens
the university." Everything should be Â¦ done
to kill it. -That' would strengthen the univer
sity.
We ar- convinced that if the undergrad
uates felt that they had a share in judging
their cwn acts, that the Judges were subject
to their own Judgment, then such antagonism
would be stamped out and the present strained
relations Bucceeded by the bond of amity that
can come enly through co-operation. There
fore this proposal to have a unity between fac
ulty and students should be considered. It Is
part and parcel of senior control. We believe
that the one will make the other effective and
both will obtain beneficial rerults which neither
could offer alone.

Engineer Hunt, the company's rep

from the United States Naval Acad
emy at Annapolis. After s'ervice in
the navy he came to San Francisco
twelve years ago. He laid out the
Midwinter Fair grounds, reconstructed
the Los Angeles street railway sys
tem, was constructing engineer of the
Independent Electric Light Company's
plant in San Francisco and has had
charge of the. construction of a num
ber of power plants in the Sierra Ne
vada Mountains. General Manager
Beal informed the Council that Engi
neer Hunt is not and never has been
in the employ of the Bay Cities Com
pany.
On motion of Councilman John L.
Howard this amendment was unani
mously accepted b>\ the Council.
The Bay Cities Water Company an
nounced to-night to the City Council
that it had chosen A. M. Hunt, a civil
engineer of San Francisco, to repre
sent the company on the board of, en
gineers that will examine the prop
erties of the corporation with rela
tion to its proposal to install a munici
pal water supply for Oakland. City
Engineer F. C. Turner has been named
for the city. These engineers will con
fer at once to name a third member
of the board and it is expected the trio
will begin its investigations very
soon. Attorney R. M. Fitzgerald, rep
resenting the Bay Cities Water Com
pany, submitted to the Council an
amendment to the original proposi
tion, which, he explained, succinctly
covers the matter of the engineers' re
port.
The revised tender, a communica
tion signed by C. N. Beal, the com
pany's general manager, provides that
a favorable report by the engineers
does not necessarily bind the city to
submit a bonding scheme to the voters.
But if the reDort shall be favorable
and the city does not call a bond elec
tion the city must pay all of the ex
penses of the commission. If the report
be unfavorable the Bay Cities Company
shall pay the expenses. If the report
be favorable and an election shall be
called the expenses shall be divided
equally between the city and the com
pany.

The three machines rented from Gray
Brothers were used In the district east
of Twelfth street and south of Market,
and If they dre withdrawn It Is likely
that many of the streets In that district
will go unswept. To do the work of the
machines by hand would necessitate
the employment of a large force of men
and It Is said there are not sufficient
funds available to pay for having the
work done. by a broom gang. The only
way President Schmitz can see out of
the difficulty Is a settlement with the
contracting firm, as he says It is doing
the work for about one-fourth the
amount It would cost to have it done
by hand.
As the result of a communication re
ceived from Gray Brothers yesterday
afternoon the Board of Public Works
finds itself confronted with a serious
problem, to which at present there
seems to be no solution. The board has
for some time been renting three street
sweeping machines from the firm at a
rate of $12 per day. There was no con
tract, but merely a month to month
agreement. The Board of Supervisors
considered this figure exorbitant, and
the bills of the firm were accordingly
held up. As a result President Schmltz
of the Board of Works yesterday re
ceived the following communication
from Gray Bros.:
In view of thÂ« fact that thÂ« Bupervigorf *n
holding up our jtreet- sweeping bill*, amount
ing to I2S12 00. for the hire of Â¦treet-Bweeplng

. The letter to his sister indicates that
he had been in the habit of embezzling
stamps, but that his shortage would
not exceed $20. It reads as follows:
At the park, Monday a. m.. Nov. 23.
G. W. Gagan, postal money order
clerk at Station C, shot and killed
himself yesterday in the bushes near
the museum in Golden Gate Park. Let
ters found on his person show that the
desperate deed was prompted by sick
ness and despondency. A paragraph
in one of the letters indicated that he
had been embezzling stamps, but that
the shortage might be small. Post
master Fisk, as soon as he was ap
prised of the tragedy, ordered an in
vestigation of the books and accounts
of the dead man.
" Three pistol shots were heard at 11:30
a; m. by Policeman John Shea near the
museum. He started in the direction
of the sounds- and -when within one
hundred feet of the clump of bushes he
heard a fourth shot. Hastening to the
spot he saw the dead body of the post
office clerk lying on its back, the head
bloody and a foot or so away a cheap
revolver which contained four recently
exploded shells. On Gagan's person
were found a letter addressed to the
Coroner and two others sealed in
stamped envelopes, one addressed tt>
his wife and the other to Mrs. Poulte
ney, his sister.
The letter to the Coroner reads as
follows:
District Attorney Byington argued
that the section of the Penal Code re
ferred to criminal prosecutions in the
courts, and not to proceedings before
the Grand Jury, which were simply in
the form of an Investigation.
After considerable argument the Judge
denied this motion. A further one, that
the proceedings be stopped as the court
had lost jurisdiction, was also denied.
The defendant then pleaded not guilty
and the trial was set for December 12,
the same day on which the trial of
Charles Wyman, charged with fraudu
lent voting, has been set.
Attorney Newburgh obtained thirty
days to prepare exceptions to the Su
preme Court. Newburgh then moved
that the action be dismissed on the
ground that the defendant having tes
tified before the Grand Jury on the
charge for which he was Indicted there
could be no further prosecution against
him under section 64 of the Penal Code.
He contended that the taking of the
testimony before the Grand Jury was
to all intents and purposes a criminal
prosecution under the meaning of the
statute.
Joseph Rebstock, inspector at the re
cent primary election, who Is charged
with violating the. election law by re
fusing to administer the oath to a voter
whose vote was challenged, is using
every technicality known to the law to
save himself from' being put on trial.
Yesterday morning Judge Lawlor dis
allowed the demurrer to the indictment,
saying that the most serious point
raised by the defendant was the ab
sence of the term â¢'qualified** from the
pleading. He thought that point could
be tested during the trial by the de
fendant urging that he was a public
officer at the time and was therefore
not qualified to act as an election of
ficer. The court would take the general
view, however, that no individual would
be permitted to urge his disability as a
defense in the commission of an unlaw
ful act.
Ordinances were finally passed au
thorizing the return of protested taxes
for schools and hospitals to a number
of taxpayers who had obtained Judg
ments against the city and ordering
street and sewer work in blocks on
Sacramento, Castro, H streets. Cres
cent and Eleventh avenues.. Army,
Hugo, Clement. Miguel. Matex\ Laid
ley, Arlington and adjacent streets.
The roadways of Dulores street be
tween Twenty-second and Twenty
third and Castro street between Jersey
and Twenty-fifth were accepted. -Street
work was ordered in blocks on Chenery,
Palmer. Fairmount, Nineteenth avenue.
Second and Third avenues.
The board passed to print an ordi
nance prohibiting the shaking of dice
for money or "chips" in public places.
The measure is an old ordinance re
enacted and is de'signed to prevent
bunko men from fleecing the unwary.
Permission was granted the Pacific
Oil Transportation Company to lay a
six-inch steel pipe line for the-trans
portation of crude petroleum from King
street on and along Second street about
two hundred feet to its foot.
Emil Pohli urged an amendment that
would permit redwood shingles to ba
used in repairs, but Supervisor Lun
.stedt said a compromise measure had
been decided upon that was deemed
fair both to the insurance men and to
the lumber dealers. The vote was:
Ayesâ Alpers. Bent, Boo^h. Branden
stein, Braunhart. Comte. Connor. D'An
cona, Eggers. Hocks. Lunstedt. Payot,
Rea. McClellan â 14. Noes â Boxton.
Finn, Sanderson â 3. â¢
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
passed to print the ordinance designat
ing a district within which fireproof
materials only must be used in repair
ing all roofs totally destroyed by fire.
The district, as defined by the second
section of the ordinance, begins at the
bay line end of Van Ness avenue, run
ning to Green street, to Baker, to
Geary, to Broderick. to South Brod
erick, to Thirteenth, to Division, to
Channel to Bay and to the point of
beginning.

nrHE circumstances so far developed in the murder of the Weber
I family at Auburn, preceded several months by the bold daylight
robbery of the Auburn bank, both crimes being ascribed to the
same person, make a case without parallel in our criminal annals.
The horror inspired by the crimes of parricide and fratricide is al
most lost in the study which the case offers to the criminologist and
psychologist. '<
The circumstances and the evidence all point to the guilt of a
twenty-year-old boy, who stands accused of entering a bank masked,
in broad daylight, and successfully escaping with a- spoil of $5000
or more in gold coin. He seized a horse and ca/fand escaped. Leav
ing the horse and f vehic!e in the road'to run away, he took to the
brush in a canyon, made a detour and returned to the road, where he
met the pursuing officers and went his way unsuspected. The dis
covery last Wednesday of the money buried under a cowshed on the
place of- his murdered parents finishes a chain of circumstantial evi
dence, in which the other links are furnished by handwriting ex
perts, and resemblance in stature and action to the robber during the
brief time afforded for observation while he was in the bank.
Now come speculations as to the motive for the murder of
every member of his family, with which he stands charged by the
Coroner's jury and the committing magistrate. His demeanor has
been curious in the extreme. Without emotion in the presence "of the
charred dead of his family and during the preliminary examination
maintaining an attitude of interest such as would become a disin
terested spectator, if innocent he is the most singular and unfortu
nate of men, and if guilty he is the most remarkable criminal in all
history. Apparently of weakly physique, in bad health, his nutri
tion deficient, yet his will is of steel and his cunning of an acute
type. He seems to have made no slight study of criminal law, he
apparently understands the necessity that his prosecutors prove an
adequate motive for the murder of his family. When the warrant
charging him with the bank robbery was served he merely said : "Is ]
that all? I supposed you had found a motive for the murders." This
shows that h/r had studied his case with considerable profundity, and
is far from being ignorant of his technical legal defense.
Lawyers and students of the criminal and abnormal will find
in his case something entirely new. Experience has exhausted the
incidents of erotic crime. In the Durrant case we had an example
of that which went to the limit of that field. But here we have a
case in which psychopathy cuts no figure, in which robbery of a bank
was not induced by any physical necessity, and parricide and frat
ricide are charged, lacking all of the ordinary motives for murder.
The officials of Placer County, in handling this icase and presenting
the evidence, arc furnishing to the school of LaTmbroso and Nordau
material ftfr digestionfand arrangement that will add an entirely new
chapter to their researches on the subject of degeneracy and abnor-

A COMMONPLACE LIFE.
SUNNY SIDE OF LIFE
"A commonplace life," we say and we
sigh.
But why should we sigh as we say?
The commonplace sun in the common

Makes up the commonplace day.
The moon and the stars are commonplace
things.
And the flower that blooms, and the bird
that sings.
But dark were the world, and sad our
lot.
If the flowers should fail and the sun
shine not â
And Ood, who studies each separate
soul.
Out of commonplace lives makes his
beautiful whole.

As I sat down something at my feet
caught my eye. I picked it, up. It was
a heart-shaped locket set with rubles.
It flew open in my hand, disclosing two
scraps of cloth, but clothâ I examined
the pieces with some interest, especially
as I noticed that my monogram graced
the upper one. They were two corners
from one of my handkerchiefs evident
ly; anyway it was my monogram.
When my eyes fell on the other piece a
bewildering lot of thoughts chased
through my brain; for that piece bore
my profile, traced cleverly in purple
ink. Florine's amuletâ a "pioture of a
man she liked!" No more letting a pal
try fortune stand between us If she
really cares â and it must be she cares,
orâ
When I got this far I jumped up and
started Joyfully for Florine's presence.
Then another idea assailed me. Sup-
It was clearly a. dare, and I took it. I
went to the summer house. Around the
summer house are trees and flowers; in
front is a miniature lake, a beautiful
place, but a dangerous one when a man
has no right to tell what sometimes
dims his eyes and impedes his speech.
Perhaps there was less danger In walk
ing. ,
"But I'm going to have another call
er," she demurred.
"Did you see him in your tea cup?" I
asked.
"No, I see him at the gate," she
laughed, "although he may be coming
to see mammaâ he is very fond of
mamma. Possibly I shall be at the
summer house soon."
Rivers are land builders. The Mississippi in its primitive state
was a land builder. The silt that it carried built all the land from
far above Xew Orleans to the present shore of the Gulf of Mexico.
Rivers where there is no mining alternately fill up their own chan
nels and raise their banks with the silt they carry, until finally they
jump oft the ridge formed by their own action and flow through
lower land to build it up in turn. The mining slickens carried into
the California rivers was an artificial acceleration oT the process off
land building, and it inflicted such injury upon the permanent in
terests of agriculture as to justify the legal steps taken to force its
discontinuance.
But there were floods before slickens, and there will be floods
after the deposit is taken from the channels. To say, therefore, that
such removal will end the trouble is to be optimistic in the face of
facts older than hydraulic mining. If the engineers determine to
clear the channel by raising the banks, it should not be left to the
slow process of scouring. Pump dredges can transfer the slickens
from the channel to the banks, converting it into a levee, that will
require the use of no other material. Or the pump dredges can
take the slickens from the channel and spread it upon the low land,
b'uilding it up at a distance from the river. This process is fa
miliar to all who have seen the filling of the salt marshes around
the bay with material pumped from its bottom.
Some plan of that sort would raise the banks more cheaply than
can be done by taking the material from the dry land, as had to be
done in the case of the great levees on Feather River.* But, as for
the main question, the cause of the floods, and the whole cause or
collection of causes, must be considered and known before they can
be removed, and it may prove a futile conclusion if hydraulic mining
is accused of the whole trouble. That it is to be blamed for some
of it is notorious, but when that part of the trouble is corrected there
will remain a large sized problem, bequeathed maybe to the pro
fessional successors of the present engineers.
There are two engineering opinions as to the efficacy of raising
the banks of a stream to compel it to cleanse its channel. There are
engineers who contend that the bottom of the Mississippi River
has steadily risen with its banks, and that these have to be con
tinually raised higher to restrain the water. In spite of all that
can be done that river defies control by levees, and from the Sny
levee to Vicksburg it breaches its confining walls and makes havoc
on millions of acres of tilled land. We are glad that something is
doing for our rivers, and the whole or partial plans reached by the
commission will be supported, we know by public sentiment, and we
hope by adequate appropriations, Federal and State.
THERE is a preliminary outgiving by one of the official engi
neers now attending the final ' conference at Sioux City to the
effect that hydraulic mining caused the floods in Californfa
rivers, and that rectification requires the raising of artificial banks
to compel the exertion of the whole scouring foroe of the streams
upon the deposit of slickens in the channels. The cost of this work
is put at $10,000,000 to $12,000,000. It is not time to fully comment
on any plan proposed until the engineers have published their report,
but it is probable that this preliminary statement expresses the con
clusion that will be reached. It is probable because most of the en
gineers have been employed on the levee work of the Mississippi
River, and are familiar with that plan of river control.
The statement of the cause of our California floods promises toÂ»
renew in some form the contention between the miners and the
valley landholders. To many the foreshadowed conclusion will be
a disappointment, since it will put the issue upon a single and a
narrow basis. If, however, the rivers formerly carried all the floods
in their channels and between their banks, before hydraulic mining
sent down slickens the cause stated may be accepted as correct and
the solution of the trouble will require merely the deepening of the
channels to their former depths.
But is it true that there were no floods before hydraulic mining?
If so, our hydrography is indeed remarkable. There is no disagree
ment that mining 1 aggravated the floods, by raising the bottom of
the channel. Volumes of water that the rivers carried between
their banks in their primitive condition overtaxed their capacity when
the channels were raised, compelling the corresponding raising o{
the banks by the levees along the Bear, Yuba, Feather and Sacra
mento. But, did Ae rivers formerly carry within their banks such
floods as that of last spring is the question. We think they did
not. nor do we think they will when their channels are scoured to
their primitive depth. Such scouring will increase their carrying
capacity and will take care of freshets that now spill over, but there
is no river draining a considerable watershed that holds all the flood
water that comes. '' i

Picture â ah!' To ba sure, I wasn't an
Adonis, neither was I afraid of break
ing the camera, but for one reasojn or
another I had faced a photographer.
Picture, was it? Was she the girl, I
wondered.
"It wasn't bone, metal, stone, paper
nor wood," she went on. "And she
didn't wear it as a protection against
anything. She Just wore it because she
liked itâ because she liked the man
whose picture was in It."
"It wasn't an amulet, then," I said,
setting down my cup.

out being fortified with disagreeable
speeohes. Otherwise I should have been
guilty of proposing to her. Considering
that her monthly inoom* was quite
equal to my annual one* a proposal of
marriage from me would hava been
palpably absurd. I sighed, and my sigh
aroused Florine. <
"Oh, I'm glad it's you," she said
brightly. "I saw a visitor in my tea
cup."
I frowned and took a chair on the
other side of the table.
"I wish you wouldn't," I said.
"Wouldn't what? Give you a cup of
tea? Are you afraid It will hurt your
complexion?"
Her tone was bantering, but her eyea
had a hint of coneera in their violet
depths. I looked away as I answered:
"The other night at 'Pit* you turned
your chair around three times, and then
when you lost you attributed it to the
misplacing of your rabbit foot."
"I did make a mistake," she said
gravely. "It wasn't the rabbit footâ it
was the day. Wednesday is my un;
lucky day."
"If you keep on folks will think you
are weak-minded." I continued, keeping
my gaze carefully from the dangerous
charm of her face. "I have actually
heard it said that you wear an amulet."
Florine was silent so long that I was
compelled to glance at her. She was re
garding ma with what might ba termed
a complex look. Her mouth was dim
pled with smiles, her lifted brows were
derisive, but her eyes were troubled. I
ignored the eyes.
"This superstition business detracts
from your real worth," I went on re
lentlessly. "It Is the flaw in the dia

"Fly In the ointment?" she suggested
politely.
"To hava It told around that you wear
an amulet I" I reiterated in fine scorn.
Then Florine laughed. When Florine

"You poor old dear!" she exclaimed
as soon as she was able. "I don't be

"Oh, don't!" she choked. "You are too

other gale of laughter.
"I don't see where the absurdity
comes,- in." I retorted. "If that isn't an

"How about a walk?" I intesrupted.
I couldn't even pretend to be disagree
able any longer; neither could I muster
up determination enough to leave. herâ
lovely, laughing sprite that she was.
"It waa an amulet," contradicted
Florine. "Unimaglnary folks get their
definitions out of the dictionary. Other
people â "
"Oh, the princess said, 1 have lost
my amulet, and I can never see happi
ness without It: so, methinks, I will
publish a decree that to him who flnd
eth It will I give his heart's desire.' "
"Describe the amulet. O princess."
"The decree should state that the
amulet is Inclosed within a case of gold
shaped like my loving heart and set
around with rubles like drops of my
own heart's blood; that the amulet is
of fine linen, marked with purple; that
each separate line stands for love,
trust, happiness; that all the lines to
gether form the lineaments of â of â "
Fiorina's dark lashes rested upon very
pink cheeks. She hesitated.
"I go to search for the amulet," I an
nounced, rising.
She looked at me approvingly. I
peered under the step, made two short
detours in the direction of the lake,
then discovered it under a small flr
tree.
Florine clapped her little hands.
"How beautifully the story proceeds!"
she cried, as sat down again to tell
her my heart's desire.
"I am wondering, though," she mused
a very long time afterward, "how the
man. came to find the amulet under a
flr tree when the princess lost it in the
summer house." (Copyright, 1904, by
Ina Wright Hanson.)
She smiled
. "Why?"
"I don't know what tha princess did
after allâ after that," I sighed, although
looking at Florine hopefully. .
"He had a mighty purpose"."
Florine giggled. I looked at her sus
piciously, but she made another dab at
her eyes, so I went on:
"For all his harsh words he repented
in sackcloth and ashes, and when the
day of hia repentance was over he knelt
on the ground at her feet â "
"Oh, no!" corrected Florine.- "He
might have taken rheumatism or some
thing."
Were ever eyes so blue- or lips so
sweet? I plunged ahead recklessly.
"He took her little hand in his," suit
ing action^to the word, "and put his
arm around her so and kissed her like
thisâ"
"How dare you?" said Florine very
softly.
"I don't dare," I answered meekly.
"I was only showing you what the man
did who belonged in the court- of the
princess."
"Well, go on," she commanded.
"I can't." *
pose Florine should think that my find
ing the amulet Influenced my declara
tionâthat It was an affair of honor, bo
to speak? I laid the locket carefully
under a small flr and went back to the
summer-house. I was scarcely seated
when Florine came flying down the
i path, her flimsy gown floating like a
I lovely white cloud around her. i
"You can laugh, or you can scold; I
don't care!" she asserted tearfully. T
did wear an amulet, but now it's gone!
She sat down by me and dabbed at
her pretty eyes with a square inch of
lace-edged linen.
I neither laughed nor scolded- I &*
gan telling her a story.
"Once upon a time there lived a beau
tiful princess, adored by every one. In
her court was a man, neither rich nor
overwlse, but loving her. he thought,
best of all. She accused him of having
no imagination, and maybe had
none; but he saw in the sunset gold of
the princess' hair, in every blue flower
hue of her eyes, In every purling
streamlet the music of her laughter.
Often he criticised ' the princess, al
though to him she was perfectâ"
"What did he do it for. then?" cried
Florine. Â£&$!!Â£

Columbia,
Last night Maxlne Elliott began the
second week of her engagement In
"Her Own Way" at the Columbia.
That the clever company of the Ma
jestic found "In Mizzoura" a congen
ial play and gave it such an Interpre
tation as Augustus Thomas had in
mind when he created that gem of
drama was admitted last night by a
highly gratified audience. Frank
MacVicars was certainly a happy se
lection for the role of the blacksmith,
Joe Vernon. He looiced the part and
spoke it with a delicious dialect. Too
much praise cannot be given J. H. Gil
mour for his excellent impersonation
of Jim Radburn, the hero Sheriff.
Adele Block, the heroine, did not have
more than half an opportunity as
Kate Vernon, but she embraced It-

interpretation of the role of Mrs. Ver

Mr. Elton belongs the proud distinction
of having made the Shah laugh. But
the gentleman's testimonials are in

that Elton is not funny enough to make
anything with a mouth laugh. Still

is in favor of Miss le Roy's having
hailed from the New Orleans French
Opera Company, whence she has been
heralded. She has chic, taste, piquancy
and eminently good . training, with a
voice, however, hardly heavj? enough
for the Orpheum. But like her method
it is of the prettiest, and it would be
wise for her not to attempt to force it
beyond its limits. " Her songs were

Several new and attractive features
were shown at Fischer's last night, in

ins vessels and two steamboats, have
been seized by the Canadian fisheries
protection cruiser Curlew and fined for
Illegal flshing in the Canadian waters
of a' tributary of Pasaamaquoddy Bay,

F To be a successful wife, to retain the love Â¦
and admiration of her husband should be a
woman's constant study. Mrs. Brown and
Mrs. Potts tell their stories for the benefit
of all wives and mothers.
"Dear Mrs. Pixkham :â Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound will make eTery mother well, strong, healthy and happy. I dragged
through nine ye3rs of miserable existence, worn out with pain and weariness.
1 then noticed a statement of a woman troubled as I was, and the wonderful
result* 6he had had from your Vegetable Compound, and decided to try what
it would do for me, and used it for three months. At the end of that time I
was a different woman, the neighbors remarked it, and my husband fell in
lore with me all over again. It seemed like a new existence. I had been suf-
fering with inflammation and falling of the womb, but your medicine cured
that and built up my entire system, till I was indeed like a new woman. â
Sineerel' yours, Mbs. Chas. F. Bbows, PI Cedar Terrace, Hot Springs, Ark.,
Vice President Mothers' Club." ft *â¢
Suffering women should not fail to profit by Mrs. Brown's ex-
periences ; just as surely as she was cured of the troubles enumer-
ated in her letter, just so surely will Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound cure other women who suffer from womb troubles,
inflammation of the ovaries, kidney troubles, nervous excitability,
and nervous prostration. Read the story of Mrs. Potts to all
mothers: â
m agn*^. " DeJlb Mrs. PnrxHAM : â During the early
part of my married life I was very delicate
in health. I had two miscarriages, and both

anxious to have children. A neighbor who

There's Only One Way to
Get the Best of Whisky
And that is th let it alone. If you try]
any other way it will get the best ofl
you. If you can't let It alone you needl
Dr. McKanna's treatment. Dr. McKan-
na cures tbe Uquor habit by destroying
the desire for liquor and putting tho
system in its natural condition, where
liquor is not needed to help the machin-
ery Â¦ of the body to do its work. Dr.
McKanna effects a complete cure in three
days without the use of dangerous hy-
podermics, annoying confinement or bad
after effects. Dr. McKanna's treatment
is absolutely safe and cannot harm the
most delicate constitution. Why waste
time and money in drinking whisky
when- you can be cured of the liquor
habit in three days with no chance of
failure, no risk and no unpleasantness?
Think it over and call or write Dr. Mc-
Kanna for full information. Address H

was knocked down four times in the

land an effective blow. Neary managed
to even matters in the next, five rounds,
although his tactics at times were'of a
rough character. In the last round Fitz
gerald tried for a knockout. He landed
two" right * swings on â¢Neary's jaw, ' ; but
the latter, although dizzy and stagger

TEXX1S PLAYERS TO i M EET
IX CONTINUOUS TOURXEY
"Smiling Mickey" McLaughlin, with
the leg up on H. L. Frank, a 17 to 20
favorite, delivered the merchandise in
the closing' sprint. The speedy sprin
ter jumped away in the lead and, al
though groggy at the finish, he dis
posed of Magrane by a length. Stand
ard, at odds of 100 to 1, fell heir to the*
show. /
Another pronounced favorite bit the
dust in the mile selling number. Moun
tebank, also piloted by Sullivan, had
his odds hammered down from S to 2
to evens, and finished a poor third.
Bronze Wing early took the lead from
the first choice, and the latter was
seized with an awful attack of the
bowwows when two-thirds of the
route had been traversed. . Less than a
furlong from the wire Bronze Wing
ran short of "coal, â¢ and "Big Bill"
Knapp, with the 7 to 1 chance Isabel
lita, crossed the line first by nearly a
length.
MOUNTEBANK IS THIRD.
W. Davis on the 15 to 1 outsider Edu
cate made a cathop of the introductory
six-furlong sprint. The mare revels in
slop and won going away from Ishtar
and Yo No Se. Mocorito, the favorite,
did not cause much disturbance, run
ning as if she did not fancy mud.
Old Morengd, which has seen all sorts
of service, from hauling the sample
trunks of Commercial Traveler Eddie
O'Brien through the small toyvns of
Oregon to being the star at a Portland
paper chase, was installed favorite for
the mile selling affair, which followed.
With Helgesen in the pilot-house, he
trudged along through the slush as if
his gum boots leaked, never figuring as
a contender. Frank Sullivan rode a
well-judged race on the third choice,
Estado, breasting the tape not, quite
two lengths before Follow Me, a 20 to 1
outsider. Willie Holmes astride Chick
adee picked up the show.
Meada, the black filly from the stable
of Bianchi &. Co., caused deep sorrow
in the camp of her followers by finish
ing third in the Futurity course sprint
for two-vear-olds. She was a 3 to 5
chance in the betting. After getting
away none too well, Sullivan got
pocketed on (the rail and it was too
late when he finally did get through.
Davis took no such chances with Ara,
the second choice, and In a driving fin
ish-downed the 60 to 1 shot Edna Sul
livan half a length. The first choice
lost the place by only a nose.
EDUCATE AX EASY WINNER,
The track at Oakland yesterday was
muddy, and after four favorites had
played havoc with the talent's time
table Sir Brillar made it five straight.
Charley Henshall's crack made one of
half a dozen starters in the five and a
half furlong purse run - for two-year
olds, and was introduced among others
to The Mist and Hooligan. So highly
had he been touted that the ring made
him an even money, chance. ,
Although the Eastern colt finished
third, it is nothing to his discredit. Nat
urally a slow beginner, he closed strong,
and had the distance been six furlongs
would have won. "Smiling Mickey"
McLaughlin rode a close race on The
Mist, and in a severe drive earned the
verdict over Hooligan by less than a
length. Sir Brillar came with such a
rush that he only lost the place by a
nose.

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 28.âEvery
thing started well with the form play
ers at Ascot Park to-day, the first
three races poing to heavily played
short-priced horses. In the last three,
however, favorites were bowled off
and there were two surprises. Two
more books drew in to-day, making
thirteen and two field books doing
business.
After taking the testimony of Mc-
Carthy and McDonald, both of whom
umpired this game, and on the admis
sion of McCarthy that he had made a
technical error in not allowing Los An
geles to score a ran which would hava
made the final score of the game 5 to 5,
President Bert made his decision.
"All protests and other matters," ha
said, "are usually taken up at the an
nual meeting, which is held December
15, but as this is an unusual instance,
where my decision has effect on thÂ«
championship, I am obliged to make
my ruling: now, while the players are
on the ground. The teams will have to
play a series of games for the cham
pionship of the second half. If Los An
geles wins then there will be a post
season series for the pennant, as Taco
ma won the first half. If Tacoma wins,
then that ends it.
Manager Fisher says that Tacoma
has won the. championship by winning
the first half and tying Los Angeles for
the second. He says he has agreed to
play Los Angeles a series of eleven
games just to show the public he has
the best team. The first game will be
played to-morrow at Recreation Park.
Following Is the protest:
SEATTLE; Wash., Aug. 23. 1904.
Mr. Ensen* F. Bert, president Pacifla Coast
League. San Francisco. Cal.
Dear Sir â I have protested the game playÂ«d
In Portland August 22. 1904. through a deci
sion made by Umpire McCarthy.
With two men out. we had a man on first
base and second base. Baum hit a ball to
left field, which trot by Xadeau and Baum went
to third base. In passing sÂ«cond base Baum
failed to touch the bag. Umpire McDonald
and one of the Portland players saw Baum
cut second base and when the ball was fielded
back to the lnfleld It was thrown to second
base and Umpire McDonald called Baum out.
In the meantime botii Ross and Eager had
crossed the home plate and the score should
have been tied. But Umplra McCarthy failed
to allow Eager's run to count. His reason
was that Eager was not at tha home plats
when Baum cut second base. But he had
crossed home plate and was sitting on the
bench when the ball was' returned to secwid
base and Baum was called out. Now what I
want to state ts that Kacer'3 run should havÂ»
counted, for Baum could not have been called
out until hÂ» was touched with the ball whil*
standing on third b.ise. or the ball thrown bacic
to second base, the bag which was missed by
the runner.
I immediately notified Umpire McCarthy that
I wouli protest th* game, which I think thÂ«
Los Angeles team is entitled to.
Trusting that you will give this your closest
attention. I remain, very truly yours.
TIM FLOOD.

President Bert ot the Pacific Coast
League has allowed the protest of Man
ager Morley or" the Los Angeles team,
and has thrown out the same In dis

ond half of the season.

It is Corbett's marked class that ap

withstanding Nelson's performances it
seems to Ptand out more strongly de
fined than usual. Corbett is fairly
Young Corbett arid Battling Nelson
are pror.ouncr-u fit and ready for their
meeting to-night in Woodward's Pa
vilion. Corbett is a strong 1 to 2 choice
in the betting, a position he has oc
cupied every time he has started in
this city. The betting is even money
he will stop Nelson inside of eighteen
rounds.
Santry and Cordell will weigh in at
Harry Corbett's at 3 o'clock this after
noon. Young Corbett and Nelson will
weigh at the same place at 6 o'clock.
Nelson has never posed as a fancy
boxer. He goes in. with dogged deter
mination and takes a lot of punish
ment. He is a slow beginner and when
his opponent begins to tire he takes up
the running and puts up a fast finish.
He has supreme confidence in his abil
ity to defeat Corbett.
Corbett's weight was given out yes
terday morning as being: 133% pounds.
He went on the road twice and expect
c3 to finish the day half a pound over
weight- The rest will be easy to-day.
He is satisfied with ,his condition, hav
ing done a lot of hard work during the
past ten days.
Nelson is half a pound under weight.
He is trained to the minute and with
his apparently inexhaustible vitality
will take a bad beating before he loses
the effective sting he carries in his
gloves. Although neither he nor his
trainers have given expression to it
there seems a feeiing among them that
Corbett will fight himself out in ten
rounds or so and will then fall easy
prey to the man from Chicago.
The only noticeable improvement In
Nelson's style of boxing since his last
appearance here is in his left hand. He
can use this cleverly, and mav worry
Cnrbett with it. Discussing his chances
yesterday he said:
"I was never in better condition for
a fight than I am now. I have trained
long and faithfully for this battle, and
think I will be declared a winner in
about fourteen or eishteen rounds. I
don't see where Corbett has it on me
any. If I lose I will offer no excuses.
Corbett has the reputation of angering
his opponents with taunting remarks.
You wllJ hear none of that this time,
as he will be too busy to do any talk
ing."
fighting for his life this time. Victory
means other and more remunerative
matches and a return of prosperity,
while defeat means little less, than
pugilistic oblivion. .The Denver bo^er
-vill take no unnecessary chances and
will probably flght a more heady bat
tle than any he has shown here.
Kls friends point out that he is a
better boxer than Kelson, a harder and
a surer hitter and :a cleverer ring gen
oral, and they do not see how he can
lose.

'When a child I had a very severe at*

ing fatal. Upon recovery the glands of tho
neck were very much enlarged, and after
the free use of iodine, the right one was
reduced to its normal size, but the left
one continued to growâ very slowly at
first, until it was about the size of a goose
egg, which began to. press on the wind-
pipe, causing difficult breathing, and be-
came very painful. An incision was made
and a large quantity of pus discharged.
The gland was removed, or as much as

years I wore alittle piece of cloth about an

open.- During this time I had to have it
cut open by the doctor every time I took

The magnitude of the suits and sen

have attracted much attention.
CLEVELAND, Nov. 23. â Herbert B.
Newton, the Brookline, Mass., capital
ist who has sued Mrs. Cassie Chadwick
for over $190,000, which he loaned her
or. notes, filed a motion in the Common
Pleas Court to-day asking for the ap
pointment of a receiver of the alleged
securities belonging to Airs. Chadwick,
said to be ln the custody of Ira Rey
nolds at the Wade Park Bank. -
"Following another conference with
Mrs. Chadwick's counsel last
we decided to bring a suit in equity
for the recovery of the money and have
obtained injunctions restraining Rey
nolds from putting the securities out
of his possession and also to prevent
Mrs. Chadwick from disposing of
them."

NEW YORK. Xov. 28. â A sensation
has been caused here by the bringing
of a suit by Herbert D. Newton of
Urookline, Mass., against Mrs. Cassie
Chadwick, a society woman of Cleve
land, Ohio, for $190,800 for money
loaned. Mrs. Chadwick is the wife of
a Cleveland physician. In addition to
Newton's suit several banks have taken
legal action to recover various amounts,
which bring the total sum to $267,800.
Newton alleges that Mrs. Chadwick
told him she had 55.C00.00O in bonds and
securities placed in trust by Ira Rey
nolds, secretary and treasurer of the
Wade Park Banking Company of
Cleveland, and that she had a note for
$500,000 which she could negotiate at
any time \for the purpose of paying
Newton. He loaned her $190,800.-
P. W. Carver of Boston, attorney for
Newton, in a statement for his client,

PITTSBURG. Nov. 28.â A bank in
Wooster went to the wall several day*
ago and the officers of the "Wayne
Coupty National Bank of that place
were somewhat worried, fearing a
"run." Almost before they had their
breakfasts on Friday morning a tele
phone message came from H. C. Frick
asking what the situation was and
whether they needed any money ln
case a "run" were started.
The answer did not appear to be just
what Frick had hoped for, so the multi
millionaire gathered up two large grips
filled with bills and in his automobile
started for Ohio. Frick reached Woos
ter early and sent out word that all
paper which the holders did not. like
should be brought ln. He settled many
notes and on Saturday morning smil
ingly took his place in the Wayne
County Bank and told every one to
"bring on the run." The result was
that there was no "run" on the bank.

The Board of Supervisors yesterday
accepted the bid of the syndicate of
San Francisco banks for a portion of
the new bond issue for public improve
ments aggregating $2,099,800. The se
curities purchased are the library
bonds, $739,800; children's playground
bonds, $740,000; Golden Gate Park and
Presidio extension bonds, 5328,000, and

The resolution on the subject recites
that the bid 'of the syndicate is the best
offered and provides that the bonds are
to be delivered on and after January
15, upon five days' notice being given
by the purchasers.
The bid of the State Board of Ex
aminers for $250,000 of the children's
playground bonds was rejected in view
of the acceptance of the syndicate's
bid- Immediate steps will be taken by
the' board to 'sell the rest of the bond

school and hospital sites and for a
sewer system. One contractor has
made an offer to the Board of Educa
tion toÂ» build one of the schoolhouses
and take his pay in bonds.
The Board of Works was authorized
to invite bids for the construction of
oil-burning plants in the City Hall
and Hall of Justice at a cost of 52400
and for a public safety station at Mar
ket street, opposite Powell, to cost 5750.
The board passed to print an ordi
nance ordering street work on San
Jose,. San Bruno, Corbett, Ocean View
and Point Lobos avenues and improv
ing the streets and sidewalks surround
ing Alamo Square at a total estimated
cost of $16,750, provision for the work
having been made in the last budget.
The City Attorney was directed to
waive an appeal in the suit of John
Center against the city involving title
to portions of Channel a*nd Alabama
streets.
The City Attorney was asked for. an
opinion whether the board has the
power to close Beach street between
Laguna and Buchanan.

Butter, Cheese and* E<Â»es.
The week opened with a better market for
Butter. Stocks showed a perceptible diminu
tion and, although there was still plenty on
hand. It was evident to even a cftsual ob
server that the market was cleaning up. In j
fact, several houses were disposed to quote ]
higher - prices, while the majority were op- 1
Â¦ posed to any advance until the market became ;
sufficiently cleaned up to allow them to raise i
the quotations with safety. The opinion was ]
I general, however, that improved quotations
might be expected very shortly. Â¦
There was no change in Cheese. :
Eggs were lower again, and. though some j
houses still hung out for previous prices, the !
majority were letting go at the quotations
below. There was no scarcity In fresh ranch.
Receipts werÂ» 33,000 lbs Butter, 514 cases

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits. I
, Trade In fresh fruits was of small volume.
aa local wants were light and there was noth- j
ing doing in the shipping line. Four carloads
of Oranges were received and five cars of Ap- !
pies came In from Oregon and Washington. |
Both descriptions were very weak and It was. 1
difficult to obtain over $2 per box for thÂ«
fanciest offerings of well-colored Navel Or- *
angea. Seedlings, Tangerines and Mexican
Limes were quoted lower. A feature of the
Citrus market was the marketing of 1100
boxes of Mandarins from Japan. The fruit
was packed in different sized boxes, $1 50
being asked for the small and $1 75 for the
larger boxes. Grapes were In light but suffi
cient supply and met with very slow sale.

chests of the ' Cheney variety, and choice offer
! Ings met with prompt sale at the quotations.

no signs of abatement, receipts to.day being

When' seen at the jail Selby would
say little. "There is no use discussing
the matter," he said. "Everybody
knows why. I did this.. I know that I
aid right to try to kill that man. I
am sorry that I made a bungle of it.
I suppose I -was nervous and that
made' my hand unsteady. If there is
another chance there will be a y differ
ent storv to tell."
After Selby was removed Judge Heb-
Kase and O'Brien turned Selby over
to Policeman Silver, in whose custody
Selby was taken to the City Prison and
charged with assault to commit mur
der.
Bracing himself against the door,
Selby raised the weapon and fired at
the Judge. The bullet whizzed past
the Judge's ear, tore thrpush the
heavy cushions of the chair and
lodged in the hardwood back. There
was much excitement until the man
was disarmed.
Selby was hurried from the court
room by Kase and O'Brien. As they
rushed him along the corridor he
called back to Judge Hebbard, "I told
you that I would do this, and I did
it"
The Judge was leaning back in his
chr>ir. Srlby came through the door
with a quick, stealthy tread. In one
hand concealed under his coat the ex
minister clutched a revolver. He hur
ried to the door of Judge Hebbard's
chambers, which is directly in front
of the bench and about six yards
away from it.
While Superior Judge James C. B.
Hebbard was holding court yesterday
morning Isaac Selby, a former minis
ter, fired point blank at him with a
revolver.
The bullet missed the Judge's head
by a fraction of an inch. With rare
courage Judge Hebbard rushed down
from his chair and assisted in dis
arming his assailant.
The courtroom was crowded. Law
yers and hangers-on about the hall
huddled into a corner as Selby flour
ished the pirtol ready for another
shot. Judg-e Hebbard was the coolest
nan in the room."
When the bullet crashed into his
chair he shook his head slightly.
"Don't let that man escape," he cried,
and ran to where the ex-clergyman
v.-as holding Bailiff John O'Brien at
bay.
The Judg-e sprang at Selby. struck
up his arm and jammed his assailant
forcibly against the wall. With the
assistance of O'Brien and Attorney
Thomas R. Kase the frenzied man was
disarmed. Kase tore the r>istol from
Selby's gra^p.
Selby was angered at the Judge be
cause of adverse decision he had re
ceived on January 6 in Hebbard's
â¢court. Selby's wife sued him for a
<Slvorc*Â» and was granted a separation
and the custody of the children. Sel
by acted as his own attorney and
thought he vras unfairly treated.
Since that time he has attempted
to annoy Judge Hebbard in many
' ways. One of his methods was to
eend the Judge screeds he had written
for Australian papers condemning San
Francisco Judges and Hebbard in par
ticular.
I>ast month Selby -svas again in
court. He brought suit against Don
ald McRae for $25,000 for alienating
his wife's efTectktns. Judge SlO3s,
\rho tried the case, decided against
Selby. The ex-minister seemed to
blame this to Judge Hebbard. r He
met Hebbard !n the City Hall shortly
afterward. â¢
"I'll do the. next best thing that I
am advised to do," said ; Selby, but.
Judge Hebbard paid no attention to
the implied threat- / > J '
The exciting episode occurred short-,
ly after 10 o'clock yesterday. Judge,
Hehbafd was hearing, the case of the
Crescent Feather Company against
the' tlpholsterers' Union. Leonard H.
McCrosky ot the union was on the
sfahd.
His wife, . Theresa Beatrice Selby,
filed her suit for divorce on* July 13,
1903, six days after. Selby had begun
his suit against Donald McRae '.for
alienating her affections. Mrs. Selby
alleged that her husband was a scholar
and teacher of high attainments and
should have been able to support her
and their three children, but would not;
that he forced her to desert him by
traducing and tormenting her. The di
vorce was granted by Judge Hebbard
on January 6- On June 4, two days
before the time for appeal had elapsed,
Selby filed a motion to set aside the
judgment, which Judge Hebbard de
nied. In his affidavit the man said the
verdict would forever exclude him from
the Christian ministry in the English
speaking world, anfl if he waa , wel
comed back to Australia it would be
because "the Australians believed it to
bo an immoral verdfet given in a dis
credited American court." He cited the
fuc'.. that Robert kouis Stevensoft was
a man of high attainments when destf

WIFE FILES SUIT.
Selby showed no inclination to stop
heaping slanders on the head of the
woman from whom he had been judi
cially separated, and -only when the
bailiff forced him into his seat did he
stop talking.
This infuriated Selby, who arose and
abused his wife, accusing her of mis
conduct with Donald McRae and criti
cizing the court for the decision ren
dered. He had spoken but a few mo
ments when Judge Hebbard interrupt
ed him, saying: "That will do from
you, sir. I* consider you less of a man
now than I did five minutes ago. If I
hear any more from you I will send you
to jaU for five days. Take your- seat."
Judge Sloss is congratulating him
self that Selby did not take a shot at
him. Ever since Sloss decided against
Sfclby, three weeks ago, he has been
-annoyed frequently by him. . Â¦
Once Selby was a prosperous.clergy
man of Australia. He ran for the Aus
tralian Parliament, but was defeated.
He alleged that his wife's refusal to
live with him caused his defeat.
Selby's litigation in the
Court has been spectacular and novel;
twice he acted as his own attorney and
was twice defeated. In both trials he
displayed intelligence and shrewdness.
On the 6th of January of this year Sel
by created a scene in Judge He'ubard'a
court and barely escaped being sent to
Jail for contempt of court. After it had
been shown conclusively that he had
not contributed a penny toward the
support of his wife for more than a
year Judge Hebbard granted Mrs. Sel
by a divorce and the custody of the
children.
bard ordered a recess and then wanted
to proceed with the case. But the at
torneys on both sides asked for a con
tinuance and the case was held over.
Scores of attorneys and employes of the
City Hall went to the courtroom to
congratulate the Judge on his escape.
"Oh,' I wasn't born to be killed by a
man like that," he said. '"Once I had
almost as narrow an escape up north.
A man jammed a pistol against my
abdomen but he did not fire."

The gratitude of the "Spider" was

hauled them for selling carbolic acid
to a woman, and then their lack of
qualification for the trade was discov
ered and led to their arrest. Judge
Fritz lined them $50 apiece for violat
ing the pharmacy law, and hereafter
their business will be performed by a
duly certificated clerk.
John Roselli was sauntering down
Pacific street last Saturday evening,
when rain began to fall upon him, and,
as his footgear was leaky, he helped
himself to a pair of rubber boots that
dangled In front of A. Somner's store
at No. 503. The theft was witnessed by
a young woman, who shrilled an
alarm, and John ran, plunder in hand,
untilhe was captured after a long and
exciting chase. He offered no defense
before- Judge Qonlan, and his sentence
for petty larceny is to be pronounced
this morning.

Harm Shirata, a dainty Japanese
miss, was accompanied by her paternal
relative" when she appeared before
Judge Slogan and stated that she
would like to have Fernando Marzo*
compelled to pay for the surgical ser
vices, necessitated by his horse step
ping upon her ribs as she was cross
ing Dupont street, near Pine, to pur
chase beer for her family's vesper
meal.
"Me cross strit," she explained, "wit"
pitcha fo* be', an' hoss it *im stip on
reeb. Me en bed one wik."
Her father gave corroborative testi
mony, and Mr. Marzo was given until
to-day to pay the doctor's bill.
Judge Cabaniss dismissed the larceny
charge which Amos Hicks had filed
against Miss" Bessie Craig, because the
young woman proved. conclusively that
the articles she was accused of stealing
from the complainant's apartments
were given by him to her as love
tokens and that his prosecution of her
was prompted by desire to prevent her
threatened transfer of affection from
him to a better-looking wooer. .
James Murray, a morphine slave, ar
rested for vagrancy, declared tha: he
did not care how long a term of im
prisonment might be prescribed for
him as his life was a failure anyway
a^nd might as well.be spent in jail as
anywhere! else. .Judge Conlan gave the
unfortunate fellow six months and was
politely thanked for the sentence.
Joseph Smith, who shot and killed
Joseph McGowan last Saturday, was
charged with murder and instructed as
to his rights before Judge Mogan. On
motion of the defendant's attorneys,
ex-Judge D. J. Murphy arid John J.
Gllfoil, the formal arraignment was
continued till next Monday, by which
time the Coroner's jury will have been
heard from. Smith looked rather
worried as he sat with his counsel and
listened to the Judge's instructions.
Miss Irene Curry gave a birthday
party last Saturday evening at her
apartments in 104 Turk street and those
present were Miss Lillie Thomas,
Thomas J. Curry and B. Castro. The
quartet unanimously informed Judge
Fritz that the landlady's intrusion was
unwarranted, as no more noise was
made than is usually produced at social
functions of that kind and that she
provoked the hurling of the mattress
at her by the way in which she talked
to the merrymakers. The landlady,
however, averred that if the party had
been deliberately trying to "make
rough-house" the uproar could not have
been greater and that it *vas to pre
serve her furniture from menacing
demolition that she invaded the cham
ber and commanded that the festivities
cease. The mattress came to her so
suddenly that she could not state which
of the defendants hurled it, but she be
lieved that- it was projected by more
thanone pair of hands. Case continued
one week.- :
Dejected of sDlritanddeprived of com

Judge Fritz's court and awaited the

The San Franciaco building has attracted
widespread Interest and the methods employed
have been thorough and effective. It gives me
great pleasure, I assure you, to express the
appreciation of the exposition management for
the manner in which the multifold tJvantages
of San Francisco city and county and the
State of California have been presented in
the lectures delivered by J. W. Erwin. - His
equipment was perhaps the best .on the grounds
and his' lectures have been highly interesting,
instructing and entertaining throughout. I
have spent many pleasant half hours in the
building and have always enjoyed his dis
courses. At every lecture 1 have attended the
assembly-room has been crowded and the com
ments and congratulations extended to the
lecturer must be gratifying, indeed, both to
him and to your committee. The results can
not be otherwise than highly beneficial for
some time to come.
Charles M. Reeves, chief of the de
partment of domestic exploitation of
the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, has
sent the following communication to
Frank J. Symmes, chairman of the gen
eral committee having in charge the
San Francisco exhibit at the. St. Louis
fair:
Ido not feel that I should allow the Louisi
ana Purchase Exposition to close without con
gratulatipg you and the committee In charge
of the Soil Francisco building and exhibit, and
through you the people of San Francisco, on
the excellent showing made at the world's
greatest fair by the city and county.
While the fund at your disposal was com

sults and the commercial advantages of thÂ«
city and county, I am pleased to say that their
natural, commercial and educational Interests
have been as well Illustrated and presented as
those cf any other city or State represented
here, if not, indeed, better illustrated.
That murder most sanguinary had
been attempted was the . impression
flashed to Patrolman Murphy's mind
by his first glimpse of Ah Fat, for the
Chinaman was prostrate and inert and
from one side of his head apparently
exuded a gelatinous substance of crim
son hue, while his blue blouse was
thickly blotched with the same stuff.
"It looks like highbinders," muttered
the officer as he bent over the fallen
Asiaticâ to discover that the imagined
clotted gore was really tomato pulp.
Little boys did it. . Three of them
were in a wagon laden with vegetables
and fruit when An Fat sauntered past
the vehicle at Bush and Larkin streets,
and with malice and reckless extrava
gance they pelted him with ripe to
matoes until their ammunition was ex
hausted. So accurate was their aim
evidently acquired by baseball practice
âthat Ah Fat found it impossible to
dodge the missiles, so he jay down and
wept and blew shrill- blasts of the
whistle that all" discreet Chinese carry.
The distress signals were heard by
Patrolman Murphy and instantly re
sponded to, but neither the wagon nor
any Â¦ of its passengers was" in sight
when he reached the spot. Ah Fat's
description of the vehicle, however, re
sulted in the speedy capture of little
Sammie Laubenbersi, who occupied the
driver's seat. The other two lads
eluded arrest.

again, might not the Judge, himself

with mercy and reward an apology
with a dismissal? Solacing thought!
Thus was Sir. "Welsh kept In canker

was cleared and his Honor arose 4 to

iously awaited summons came.

the court, "but your insistent trying to

GAME NEAR DYING
From an Awful Skin Humour*
Scratched Till Blood Ran.
Wasted to Skeleton.
CURED BYCUT1CURA
One Application Soothed Him to
Sleep. Cure Speedy
and Permanent.
" When my little boy was aboot three
months old his bead broke out with a
rash, which was very Itchy and ran con-
siderable watery fluid. We tried every-
thing we could, but he got worse all the
time till It spread to his arms, legs, and
then to his entire body, and he got so
bad that he came near dying. The rash
would itch so that he would scratch till
the blood ran, and a thin yellowish stuff
would be all over his pillow in the morn-
ing. I had to put mittens on his hands
to keep him from tearing his skin around
his wrists. He got so weak and run
down that he took fainting spells like
we would think him dying. He was al-
most a skeleton and bis little hands
were thin like claws. *
"He was bad about eight months
when we tried Cuticara Remedies. I
had not laid him down in his cradle In
the daytime for a long time. He had
got so that he just slept in our arms all
the time. I washed him vr'ith Cuticura
Soap and put on one application of
Catlcura Ointment and he was so
soothed that I pat him in the cradle.
You don't know how glad I felt when ho
felt better. It took one box of Cuticura
Ointment, pretty near one cake of Cuti-
cura Soap, and about half a bottle of
Outlcura Resolvent, to cure. I think
our little boy would have died only for
the Cuticura Remedies, and I shall al-
ways remain a firm friend of them."
Mns. M. C. M AITLAND, Jasper,
Ontario.
No return in 14 years. Mrs. Maitland
writes, under date of Feb. 24, 1903, that
the cure is permanent.
" It affords me much pleasure to In-
form yon that it is fourteen years since
my boy was cured of the terrible skin
disease from which he suffered.

Is hearty and strong." ,
