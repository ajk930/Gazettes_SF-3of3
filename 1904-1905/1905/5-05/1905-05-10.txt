NEW YORK
DENVER, May 9.â There will be a
bitter fight over the estate of Mrs.
Eieanor Chambers, who ; died in San
Francisco, leaving property worth $250,
000 to Clarence Graves, a Jockey. T. O.
Morris of 1451 Gilpin street, Denver, a
brother of the deceased, is authority for
the statement. Mrs. Chambers owned
ir.uch real estate in Indianapolis, and
Â£or this reason the contest will be
Etarted there, on May 22.
Clarence Graves, ten years ago, was
a resident of Boulder, where he married
Miss Belle Morgan. About a year after
his marriage he deserted his young
wife, went to San Francisco and be
came a stable boy at the race tracks,
'which occupation he changed shortly
afterward' for a position as. waiter in a
hotel. In this capacity he' met Mrs.
Eleanor Chambers, who. 'with; her in
valid father. General' T. A." Morris, was
Etopping there. ; ,
Mrs. Chambers needed some, one to
help her care for her father, who* was
entirely helpless, and she became
favorably impressed with the; bright
face and deft manners of the- waiter.
Â« Hhe,Â«jjiployed Graves, ..who \ became her
lather's valet and "her = jockeyâ f or- she
purchased several race horses, largely
because of his Interest in ho roes. V**' "s \u0084,;
In March. > 1903, General \u25a0Morris, died
in San Francisco, leaving" his immense
fortune to his daughter. After this
Graves was kept busy \u25a0 waiting .upon
Mrs. Chambers, and until -her. death
in the autumn after her father's de
cease, he continued in the capacity of
right-hand man. Broken . with sorrow.
Mrs. Chambers was unable to - depend
upon herself, and all her affairs were
intrusted to the management of Graves.
WTien her relatives learned the pro
visions of her will, they* were thunder
struck. They knew Graves had strong
influence over her, but did not believe
ehe would leave him all she had. Mor
ris, who ie a prominent civil engineer.
Is investigating the record of Graves.
He does not believe the will is genuine.

MANY NARROW ESCAPES.
There were many narrow ' escapes
from death. lone Saileen. the infant
It was not until 8 o'clock this
morning that physicians an 3 sur
geons began arriving from sur
rounding' towns. In the mean
time dozens of willing hands set
to work to clear away the debris and
extricate the dead and injured.. The
Swedish Lutheran parsonage and sev
eral private residences were turned
into temporary hospitals, while the
dead were taken to the storerooms of
Oiaf . Olson and . laid out in rows,
awaiting identification.'
Just before daybreak a representa
tive of the press made the rounds of
the different places. In one room in
the Lutheran parsonage he found six
injured, and in an adjoining . room
were five corpses. , In half a dozen
other houses similar scenes were
found. Dr. Lund, the Lutheran
pastor, was passing about among -""the
suffering, ministering to their com
fort, while two score, other persons,
working under his direction, cared
for the injured at other points. *
In several cases entire families have
been killed. A man named Switzer. a
night watchman at the railroad yards,
lost his three children, j ~N. P.- Nelson,
his wife and three children were found
dead. Two other children were not at
home and escaped injury.*
When the missing In Marquette had
been pretty thoroughly accounted for.
the- searchers directed tbfelr attention
to" the surrounding country. Soon half
a dozen wagonloads of dead and In
jured had been brought to the town
from the district adjoining it on the
south. - -- \u25a0'\u25a0â¢..â¢

MARQUETTE. Kans., May 9. â
Twenty-nine persons were killed and
forty-five injured in a tornado, the
most disastrous in the history of Cen
tral Kansas, which swer>t orer this
portion of the State at midnight. One
larg* section of Marquette, where the
principal loss of life occurred, was en
tirely wiped out. Reports from the
surrounding country show that the de
struction to life and property wag
videspread and the list of dead and
injured is growing constantly. A store
room was converted into a temporary
morgue. Following: the storm the ut
most confusion prevailed and it was
sometime before the actual extent of
the storm was known. Thirty-five of
the injured may die.
The dead: Gus Anderson, Tillie El
lersun. A. V. Anderson and wife, Mrs.
Elmer Huttgren. Blanche Switzer,

When daylight broke over the town
the entire population was in a state
of panic. Business was entirely sus-^
tended and every one who escaped
injury turned his attention toward
aiding the wounded. i
The tornado formed three miles :
south of Marquette and did not enend
it* force until it had passed many
miles north of the town.
In Marquette the residence portion
\u25a0west of the main street suffered the
erestest damage. The houses in the
c-oursp of the tornado were, with two
or three exceptions, â¢ completely
wrecked. In thle section there were
a number. of modern . residences. The
Swedish Lutheran and Methodist
eliurches xvere among the first build
inÂ£i? struck, and they, together with
the partonage adjoining the Metho
dist church, were completely demol
ished. . . .
Yesterday afternoon was hot and
oppressive, the atmosphere loaded
with electricity. Late in the evening
a. terrific rainstorm broke over the
town. The rain continued to fall , in
torrents until 11:55 o'clock last night,
when the tornado struck. In less
than five minutes it had wrought its
terrible work and passed on. Tele
graph and telephone wires were car
rted down, and it was several hours
before the outside world could be ap
prised of the plight of the city. .
The Social Democrats are straining
every effort to make the proposed dem
onstrations cm the Russian May day a
success.
LONDON, May 10.â A dispatch to a
news agency from Odessa saj's it is re
ported there that thirteen Jews have
been killed in riots at Melitopol in the
Government of Taurida, Russia.
ST. PETERSBURG, May 9.â The re
port in circulation here last night that
there had been a massacre of Jews
at Zhitomir, Government of Volhynia,
Southwestern Russia, is confirmed in a
dispatch to the Novostl, which says
the rioting wag begun on. May 7 and
continued for forty-eight hours. Ortho
dox Christians fell upon the Jews in
the streets. The Jews .were armed and
fought their assailants," many being
killed or wounded on either side. .
Private dispatches from Zhitomir at-.
tribute the attack upon the, Jews to
articles jn Kroushevan's paper. Twelve
persons were killed and fifty were
wounded. On Sunday the Jews tele-/
graphed to friends in St. Petersburg to
ask the authc-rities to take .strong
measures for their protection and or
ders, to that effect were sent. â¢, A re
newal of the fighting was expected.
Commenting upon this news, the No
vosti remarka upon the coincidence that
Kroushevan (the former editor of the
Bessarabyetz of Kishenev, held to be
responsible for the massacre of 1903 at
that place), had hardly gone to Zhito
mir aftd started, the publication of ' a^
new. paper, the Friend, before Jewish
massacres commenced in the neighbor
hood.

WASHINGTON. May 9. â The Govern
ment'will reply to the inquiry of the

ask certain questions about Panama
rates^ by'saying that the policy of,. the
President .will be to advocate the re

the Government to a loss.
"According to dispatches, a report Is

Jennings,'. W.'J. ; Dutton -and W^'" R.'*
Wheeler. ; It will be. read to the Presi

{of .transshipping goods via Panaroa.
and asks 'for inf.ormatipn .regarding
rates. It is shown thar-there la t loss^
by breakage, and because of the "time*
consumed Â«* material reduction of*
rates 'would be necessary, to offset this.
The: Government's departments^will,
find that "there is not 'a great deal of>
loss by-breakage and: that the average
shipment of goods via^Panama Is "made
, of material that cannot very . well ' bÂ«*
Injured by delay in shipment. Th?
percentage of saving by 'shipment 1 via
the isthmus over "shipment by rail
roads has not' been -more than * 5 8 ".per ,
cent, sometimes much less. Und^r the
Government plans it is possible, to'
make the saving at least 20 per cent on
non-perishable goods. : Non-perishable;
I goods,; however, are sometimes affected**
by fluctuations of the markets and -the'

Leona Brooks, the woman with whom
Tax Collector Edward J. Smith' fled
after robbing the city of nearly $100,000,
arrived in San Francisco yesterday.
She maintained at first .that she had
not left with Smith,' .but had met him
in St. Louis by appointment. Later she
admitted that ehe was with the . de
faulter during his flight ; until . they ar
rived in New York. '*
There the woman; read an account of
Smith's crime In a newspaper and
learned, she asserts,- for the first -time
that he was a criminal. She became
alarmed and almost created a scene in
the' hotel where they were staying, but
Smith soothed. her. .':She 'left him,, how
ever, and went to" Hot"- Springs. \u25a0; Later
Smith telegraphed her to meet him in
St. i Louis, and detectives who ; traced
her *fromÂ» Hot ..Springs . found him
through following his 'paramour. : â¢
She is not the " brazen type of the
fallen woman with whom the defaulter
was lnfatuated.v She seemed worn â¢ and
tired from the effects of her experience,*
but; even in that state \u25a0 her " claims ? to
attractiveness^could ! not be .'disputed. - %

her in the Chiefs; office, "are 'both cer-,

a spender,", she ; said. "- ,"When , I asked
him \u25a0In New. -York \ what he had done
with 'the money he said 'I don't know;'
it just went.'" , .
. "How ; much , money did he have?"r
was the' pertinent question asked, her.

I J. Harry Scott, the newly appointed
Tax Collector, is of the opinion that
the affairs of % the license office have
not been properly conducted in the
past and he proposes to effect a reor
ganization of the office. To that, end
he will have the license office trans
ferred from its present location in the
City Hall to the main office/ where the
taxes are collected. * '. -
Scott proposes to have but one cash
ier to handle the moneys received for
both licenses and', taxes. He' has: ap- ;
pomi ed J his brother-in-law, Oscar Cur-, j
tn.v, to j the position, and C'irtaz will'

much divided responsibility,! and ; he j
means to effect a reform in the man- <
ncr of transactiong the -A city's busi- ]

Scott yesterday brought nearly all
the clerks of the license office over to
the tax office for the purpose of pre
paring the delinquent tax roll. He ex
pects to have the list ready by next
Saturday evening, as it will go to the
printer next week. Scott does not con
template making any removals in the
office now. George B. Benham has
assumed his duties .as Chief Deputy I
Tax : Collector. Scott said that he
knew of Deputy. James W. McCabe's
alleged shortcomings arid he. did not
Intend, to remove him. .- ~ . *
"McCabe is a good clerk," Ysaid
Scott, "and when he returns he will be
permitted to resume his duties. He
! will draw ' salary only for.' the , time ; he
has worked this month.v His retention |
of- the place will depend on his good'
conduct in the future." -

3IAY FIND INDICTMENTS^
The Grand Jury will meet in Judge
Lawlor's court to-day to take definite
action on the investigations made into
the affairs of the Treasurer's office. . It
is expected that one or more indict
ments will be found. It is certain that
the jury will also call to account some'
one in the license office. _ '
Foreman Andrews has announced
that section 424 of the Penal Code has
been violated in the Treasurer's office,
but he declines to say what action may
be taken by the jury ; in regard to it.
Graft has been rampant in the license
office, but the foreman refuses to say
who was proved guilty by the investi
gations. "The Grand Jury will do its
duty," he said. "The results of tJy? in
vestigations will be laid before the jury
to-morrow and it will be up to them.
WELL MAKE SHORTAGE GOOD.
City Treasurer McDougald yesterday
issued a public statement, in which he
announces that the personal check of
defaulting ex-Tax Collector Smith for
515,590 08 which Chief Deputy Devoto
cashed will be taken up. McDougald
desires to inform the public that the
rumors prevailing that he would not
make good the check in the event that
the Grand Jury should return indict
ments against him or Devoto are with
out foundation. The statement follows:
Treasurer'a Office, City Hall. May 9. . 1905.
In the matter of ths shortage in my office,
resulting from the action of E. J. Smith, Tax
Collector. I wish to\ announce that I will cover
the oarne. No action that can or will be taken
In thÂ« premises will deter me, from returning
to the treasury the money represented by the
check cashed by my deputy for the Tax Col
lector. This statement is made to set at rest
many conflicting, rumors and to Inform . my"
friends and the public "of my intentions,
J. E. McDOUGAkD,
Treasurer city and county of San Francisco.
McDougald has already received afi
surances from a number of friends:
which will enable him to gather the
funds to take up the check. Some of
those who wish to aid McDougald in
his trouble are indignant at the delay
of the Grand Jury in taking whatever
! action it may. see fit in the premises.
McDougald hopes ;to have all the
money subscribed in two or three days.

OtruCKEE, May 9.â lt is beHfeved
that ;the ' work of boring the big tun
nel of the ' Southern); Pacific ; through
the summit of the Sierra' Mountains at
a rjoint . one and- a half - miles from â¢
here will: 'soon be ;â¢' commenced;
Charles Erickson of the firm of Erick

be bored. J .: . *
: It has been announced ,that *, the
Southern Pacific Company, has award
ed the contract for! this 'great work to
this 5 firm and . that it will commence
preliminary work some time 'during

Heretofore the citizens Â» of i Truckee
have . been loth to believe : the: â¢ many
stories that have been i published ; con
cerning jthe boring of j this tunnel, but
since learning that Gould' has ; with
drawn from the Harriman crowd and
will build the.. Western: Pacific:: from
Salt Lake to Oakland, they believe the
Southern Pacific will be'ready to, meet
the time of their "competitors .when
the Goulds complete their line v, from
coast to coast. By beginning: the work
at once the Southern Pacific can : have
the tunnel^ ; bored, .by; the time the
Western Pacific -is driving j V the . last

In reference to your Insinuation that "if
when you discovered gome months ago the
Irregularities of the Tax Collector's office you
had been equally ready to notify me thereof
instead of concealing the same from me. so
that Mayor Schmltz might not have the op
portunity of appointing his successor, the city
would have been saved a very large sum of
money and the community would not have
been plunged into the shocking horror of
learning by his flight the extent and character
of the misconduct of a trusted public servant.
long theretofore known to you to have been
false to his trust," permit me to state that
this statement is also false. I take It for
rranted that It emanate* from one of, your
confidential agents whose business career, per
â¢onality and character Is known to many and
of which I presume you are personally ac
quainted or otherwise I am cure he would not
be in your emDloy. ' \u25a0_
And furthermore, the Grand Jury, and par
ticularly ita foreman, has never been In poa
cession of any facts or irrfromation of the
Irregularities of the Tax Collector's office, ex
cept that which has been published from tima
to time In the newspapers.
The Grand Jury has been for come months
and is now investigating the so-called "dum
mies" ui>on the payroll of the Tax Collector's
office, running as far back as 1902. It is a
ta6lc consuming much time and involving con
eiderable labor, and hae been submitted to
Mr. Kytka. the handwriting expert, some clx
Â«-eekÂ« ago. for his opinion and report. Mr.
Kytka. is still working en the matter, assisted
by Detective Thomas Gibson.
TEII>S OF INVESTIGATION'S.
ThÂ« Grand Jury also investigated the in
junction euit of I. Silver, preventing* Tax Col
lector Smith from dismissing him as an em
ploye from his office. -* This suit apparently wu ;
a. mutual one between Smith and Silver, and
Smith undoubtedly intended to let It go by
default. The Grand Jury, after consultation
\u25a0with the City Attorney's office. Mr. Brobeck
acting, forced Mr. Smith Into submitting hit
eaÂ»Â» to that office, to that It could be properly
pretectti and contested before Judge Sloss.
In the meantime investigation upon the part
ef the Civil Service Commission and the Grand
Jury developed the fact that I. Silver's exam
ination papers were crooked, resulting In the
dropping of his name from the civil servlea
list and the suit from the calendar.
It is a source of much pleasure and gratifi
cation to me to note and accept your marked
,Â»Ti<s sincere appreciation of ~ "my kindneas in
publicly calling attention to Mr. McCabe's |n- a
tcxicatlon." Mr. McCabe being your temporary
appointee, pending the appointment of a suc
cessor to Mr. & J. Smith, Tax Collector, re
moved.

SAYS STATEMENT IS FALSE.
Foreman Andrews sharply denied
yesterday that he knew of Defaulter
Edward J. Smith's crookedness before
the former Tax Collector flÂ«d the town
and that the news was told him by the
Mayor. The allegation made by the
Mayor that be knew that McCabe had
made the annual accounting is branded
as an absolute falsehood by Foreman
Andrews. Following is the juror's let
ter In full:
EAN FRANCISCO. May 9. 1905.
Hon. E. E. Echmitz. Mayor of the Clty
Â«_Ed County of San Francisco â Dear Blr: Your
co2-.mur.lca.tion of May 6. which, according
to notation en the back of the envelope, was
left under tbÂ« door of the Grand Jury rooms,
aii".:Â« building, on Saturday evening-. May 6,
1905, at Â£:30 o'clock, did not reach me until
11:15 a. ay . May S. 19C5.
I take decided Issue with you In your state
ment: "I bee to advise you this moralnr,
loss prior to the transmission of your letter.
a proper accounting was made. T. E. Atkin
son, expert accountant, by my direction, as
â¢iitlns therein."
This statement is absolutely false. Mr. At
ktnaon did not assist In the settlement to
be filed with the Auditor and the Treasurer.
Such 1b the testimony of all who participated
In the preparation of the official figures. The
settlement was not made "in the morning
long prior to the transmission of my letter to
you." In fact the settlement was not made
until 3:30 o'clock or later. Saturday afternoon. '
Tour offlce apparently knew absolutely noth
ing of the vettlement to be made until John
R. Smith, the cashier of the Tax Collector's
office, acting in conjunction with Douglas
Young the Grand Juries expert, called It to
the attention of Mr. Reane. your secretary,
at about 11 o'clock on Saturday morning.
Mr. Keane evidently realized the Importance
of the notification for he stated that he did
not know where you were, but would use
every possible means to communicate with
you. It seemg exceptionally etrange to me
that "a settlement to your satisfaction early
on Saturday morning" was effected, when as
a matter of fact the clerks were not detailed
to make up this report until about 10 o'clock.
PomÂ« of them were compelled to go without
their luncheon in order to finish Bald settle
ment for proper presentation to the Auditor j
before the close of office hours. j

FRESNO. May 9.â United States
Commissioner of Internal Revenue
John W. Terkes, in company with Rev
enue Agent J. W. Sinsel of New York
and Revenue Agent B. M. Thomas' of
San Francisco, visited several large
wineries in this county to-day. To
morrow other wineries will be visited.
"I have found that the California
wineries are woefully lax in their ob
servance of the revenue laws," said the
Commissioner to-nigrht, "not with
fraudulent intent, however. The lack
of observance has been partly due to a
lack of knowledge of the laws and
partly from a general looseness. As a
result of my visit here there will be a
reformation in regard to the keeping
of regulations."
CHICAGO, May 9.â The Interstate
Commerce Commission during . its
"corn products investigation" to-day
heard representatives of California
milling interests who protested
against a reduction of the 10 per
cent differential existing on corn meal
rates over rates on corn from Ne
braska to Pacific Coast points.
W. C. Keller/president of the
Globe Grain and Milling Company of
San Francisco, testified that even the â¢
10 per cent differential rate is so low
as to greatly injure the business of the
California millers. ' ' T
"The cost of manufacturing corn
meai," declared Keller, "is so ' great
: to,, us that , if the differential were
lower 'we ' could in no way ] compete
with the Nebraska men. If it is'low
ered we will simply have to go out of
business in ; California. It should be,
to be fair, at least 20 cents instead of
10 cents."
W": M. Smith and C. S. Laumeister,'
other San Francisco cereal manufac
â¢ turers, made similar statements.
Chairman Clements then 'announced
that the corn investigation would rest
.for the Dresent and that the commis
sion would proceed with an investiga
tion into woodenware rates.
Silas Pullard, attorney \ for the
Menasha (Wis.) Woodenware Com
pany, entered a complaint that certain
transcontinental railways are charging
more for transporting woodenware
from "Wisconsin to Pacific' Coast points
than from the Pacific Coast to Chi
cago and other cities of the Central
States. The Northern Pacific and the
Chicago, Burlington and Quincy rail
ways were the roads specified.
James B. Kerr appeared as the rep
resentative of ' the Northern - Pacific
Interest, .while J. P. Dawes represent
ed the Chicago, Burlington and Quin
cy Railroad. ,
Henry N. Mann of Chicago, who was
; formerly president -of the Two Rivers
Manufacturing Company, Two Rivers,
Wis., .testified that his company had
been .driven out of the. State by the
excessive rate, charged by the railways
for shipments by "Western manufactur
ers of woodenware. The \u25a0witness - de
clared that when relief was asked "for
the railway men arrested the 'request
j with the statement that the packers
! dictated the rate of 55 cents given the
Western people.
"The- high rate -charged us for ship
ments to the Pacific Coast," said Mann,
"drove us , out -of the State of 'Wash
' ington, and the low rate given the coast
manufacturers practically killed J our
trade in the Missouri River : ; district." >\u25a0
; J. M. Hannaford, second vice presi
dent of the Northern Pacific- lines/ at
this point in the hearing took the stand
and explained: the situation from' the
railway point of view. . Hannaford de
; clared that it was ; he -who made the
1 rate to the woodenware factory own
! era in Tacoma and that the rate was
j not made at the dictation of the pack
1 ers. -
j "The Pacific Coast people," said Han
naford, "consulted us concerning a
better rate which would enable .them ;
to ship to the Missouri, and we made a
rate . of .$1 05/- This . proved . too .' high
and the rate was \u25a0 gradually reduced
until finally, it was made 65 cents. If
an equal rate existed we could not hold
this Western business and we cannot
afford'to lose it."- ,â¢ /
"Your, own " business Interests, howr*
ever," said Commissioner Prouty, "con
stitute one thing and an act of justice
to , all : shippers is another thing. The
two must be merged, don't you think?"
"Very â¢ true," was : the . reply, '.'but we
maintain -that both: rates are Just."
;* J. W.- Brokaw ot r. Tacoma .testified
that a, higher 7 rate .than -65 cents given
' the Western points would' kill the. busl-
I ness to. Missouri River points. "

Young: Capitalist Is a : Ward Eleven
Years Beyond the Time He Should
Have -Been..
Though Walter S. Hobart, the
young capitalist, .became of age on
April 26, x 1594, . more than eleven
years ago, he was in . fact under the
charge of a guardian until , yesterday.
When young Hobart's father died
Edward J. McCutchen was appointed
his guardian to care for his interests
during the period of the settlement of
the estate, the letters to remain . in
force until Hobart reached the age of
21 years.
Hobart reached his majority long
abo, but for some reason not ex
plained in . the. petition the. guardian
was not discharged at that, time, and
the letters stood on the records unre
voked and"- in full effect. . Yesterday
afternoon, however. McCiitchen \u25a0â¢ pre
sented a petition asking that lhÂ» be
discharged as guardian. The petition
was accompanied by a request from
Hobart that the guardian be not com
pelled to file an account of his re
ceipts and expenditures as guardian.
Hobart's request was granted, and
Judge 5*5 * Kerrigan" signed ; the order dis
charging McCutchen as prayed. Thus
Hobart is cast upon his own resources.

FOUR MORMOX CHTLDREX
DEXEED A IjAXDIXG
Immigrant Officials Believe That Xew
Comers Are ' Liable to Become
Charges on the Public.
Four Mormon children came all the
way from Xew Zealand to this port on
the steamship Sierra en route to
Utah and have been denied a landing
by the United States immigrant offi
cials. Their . names ; are Emma J.
Harding, aged .11 years; Charles G.
Harding, aged 9; Robert G., aged 7,
and William G-, aged 5. Their case
was investigated by United States Im
migrant Inspector D. J. Griffiths. He
found that their mother' was dead,
their father a carpenter in the Gov
ernment service in New Zealand, and
that all the money, they had was 21
cents. A Mormon missionary, named
J. H. W. Goff, who had been stationed
in Xew Zealand two years ago, pre
sented himself to take charge of the
children and stated he had 550 where
with to pay their expenses to Utah.
Goff stated that he was acting for an
other Mormon missionary, named Ste
phens, who was to care for the chil
dren in Utah, and that they would be
sent to public schools in that State.
The special board of inquiry decided
that the immigrants were liableto be
come public charges, < and - therefore
denied them a landing-. .

! The opinion of Collins himself on. this

laughed, as if passing upon: his own

said: "A prominent judicial officer, of
this city has expressed' the opinion that
the charge would lie only in the place
where the alleged second ; marriage is
contracted. I: am inclined to "think -he
is right and that the statutes are to be
so construed." '

If we were to assemble all
those who have, been cured of
heart disease by Dr. Miles'
Heart Cure, and who would
tCHday be in their graves had'
riot Dr. Miles' â¢\u25a0been successful
in perfecting this wonderful'
heart specific, they would pop-
ulate a large city.
What a remarkable recordâ
a jbreathing, thinking, moving
rryonument; composed of human
lives, â that for which every
other, earthly possession is sac-
rificed. \
The Miles Medical Co. re-
ceive thousands of letters from
these people like the following :
"I feel Indebted to the ,r>r. Mfl<Â«'
Heart Cure for my life. I desire to call
the attention, of , others suffering, as I
<51d to this remarkable remedy for the
heart." For a long time I had suffered
from shortness of breath after any â¢
little exertion, palpitation of, the heart;
and at times terrible pain in the region -
of the: heart, so serious that I feared
that I would some.tlme drop dead upon
the street. One day I read one of your
circulars, and immediately - went; to >
my drugnsist and purchased two bot- '
. ties of the Heart Cure, and itook it
. according -to directions, with the -
result that I an entirely cured.- Since â¢\u25a0-
"\u25a0\u25a0 then I never miss \u25a0 an ' opportunity ;. to ) â¢
, recommend this remedy to my friends â¢
who have heart trouble: In fact Â» l am
a traveling- advertisment, for I am'
\u25a0widely known 1 in this locality." h.

i BFJKKELETST, Hay &.â Students of the
' unlver*fty have to-day 'spent what time
\u25a0 they ha d to spare from examinations
in considering the fall " import "of the
: revolationary measure successf ally put :
thrcrnsrh by the executive committee of
| the Associated Students, whereby the
committee is ;to absolutely ', Control | all
student activities in the future,' par
ticularly with reference to diversions
enjoyed at the colleges. '/\u25a0
It was expected that a strong-pro
test would be made In * certain : quar
tern that hitherto have un
restricted, facilities for out
j their plans for amusement, but- the
news of the executive committee's sur
prising plan has apparently stunned
most of the undergraduates. Their
talk of it to-day was ot that ' sort
which w>t>m* to v tmt- partly appreciate
the significance of the movement r -:- Only
the freshmen and sophomores really
walled. The others are "considering."
Joseph P. Loeb, editor iof the Call
fornian. advocated such a measure In
thÂ« ; college daily a week ago, .but It
was not known then that .; the .execu
tive ccrrnmittee seriously considered fol
lowing out his recommendations and
making them into concrete statutes.
That . has occurred, however.
The executive committee made It
plain to-day that certain time-honored
class and college activities will -be' con
aldered as entitled to place on the list
of permissible functions. : This list In
clndes such, affairs: aa the freshman
glee, the freshman reception, the soph
omore hop, the junior promenade,',; the
sÂ«nJ&r bail, the senior assemblies, the
colonial ball, the eenior banquet, ban
quets by colleges, etc. Diversions for
women must receive the -approval of
the Associated Women, Students.'/,
The poor success of some dramatic
performances recently conducted under
the auspices of the university helped
to convince the " influential students
that pruning was ' necessary. ',-, V.
It will hereafter be impossible for an
ambitious "co-ed" or clique of "co-eds"
to 4a4 a club or; "frat,"^prepare
! an' entertainment; r and then ; calKupon
â¢ college people' to ; support* and - "show
their college spirit"* In -the^ act. â¢'* V? t Â«.; '->>.
The freshman and sophomore classes
particularly will feel' the bridle, aa'the
list of functions they will be - permitted'
to engage in is limited, to traditional
affairs. .. - \u25a0 ' '',';..;:\u25a0\u25a0â¢ '-:V \u25a0-'
It is from the sophomore and fresh
man classes that the wail arises to-day.
The sophomores particularly, resent the
cutting out of the " sophomore bur
lesque, a feature that was successfully
carried out at the Macdonough Theater,
In Oakland this year. The freshmen,
bein? limited absolutely .to their one
glee, and reception, regard themselves
an hardly used, and it in possible that
a ' memorial from the class, in /relation
to the matter, will be presented to the
university authorities during the next
few days.

Electrical Workers' Union, Local Xo.
6, has at last taken action to punish its
defaulting treasurer, E. F. Allender.
Yesterday George F. Keetley, presi
dent of the union, obtained a warrant
from Police Judge Cabaniss for Al
lender's arrest on a charge of felony
embezzlement. The amount alleged In
the complaint Is $1518 30. :
Some -weeks ago suspicion was
aroused that all was not right with the
treasurer's accounts and it was dis
covered that there was a shortage of
$1518 30. At the next meeting of the
union on April 28 a demand was made
upon Allender for the amount and he
promised* to make it good. He has
not kept his promise and it Is believed
that he has fled 'the' city.
Allender is a married man.\ It Is
said ' that he squandered the funds of
the union in playing the races. It was
the knowledge . of his making large
bets ' that led to the suspicion of the
funds being tampered with.

Taking lesson from the battles he
saw waged over ponderous and am
biguous wills, Ezra E. Washburn, late
bailiff of the Supreme Court, prepared
the smallest testament ever filed in
the Probate Court of this county.. ThÂ«Â»
will is written on an ordinary calling
card; both sides .being utilized. On
one side of the card the following is
written:
"SAX FRANCISCO, July 9, 1902.
"I give all my property to
Emma Hauk; appoint her executor
without bonds; request Mr. Gray, un
dertaker, to take charge of remains.
Xo funeral. Have body cremated."
On the reverse side of the card is
written:
"Leave Lloyd (5) five dollars and
desire Emma to do the best she can
for him with what I leave her, all my
personal property and two life insur
ance policies.
"EZRA E. WASHBURN."
Miss Hauk was housekeeper for the
testator at his home, at 324 Ellis street.
Lloyd, referred to in the will, is a de
mented son of the deceased, aged 29
years, who has been an inmate of the
Xapa Asylum for ten years. The
estate of the deceased. is estimated to
be worth $3000.
Attorney George E. Bates, who filed
the will, said it was as valid as though ;
drawn in full size and in the most con
ventional form and has the advantage
of offering no ground of attack on
technicalities should a claimant ap-_
pear.

The celebrations of the German-
American citizens in commemoration
of the hundredth anniversary of the
roet Schiller's death came to an end
â¢with a large indoor celebration at the
Alhambra Theater last night. The the-
V ater was handsomely decorated with
flags and greenery, and every seat was
taken.
The programme began with Beeth
oven's overture, "Egmont." by the
large orchestra under the capable
leadership of Frederick Zech ,Jr-
Following this Professor -Hugo K.
Schilling srave the oratioji. He con
fined his remarks principally to the
circumstances of Schiller's death and
described Goethe's affection for SchU
lcr. .
Professor Schilling then introduced
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler, who
told of the claim Schiller had on the
hearts of all nations. He told of the
continual attempts of circumstances to
force Schiller into a trade or a profes
sion until at last the poet triumphed ;
'\u25a0over conditions and became his own;
master. He closed by saying thafri
through Schiller Germany had wid- â¢
ened the scope of her spiritual domin- i
ion. Professor Julius Goebel also
spoke.
Following the speeches came a I
mixed chorus of 250 voices of men j
*>nd women from the various singing 1
societies. They sang Mendelssohn's i
"Die Kunstler" and a solo and chorus I
of Schiller's "Bell" by Romberg. Fol- i
lowing this came ; a musical pro- i
gramme of solos and duets and a reci- |
â¢ tation of Goethe's "Epilogue." !
The evening's entertainment closed ]
with a representation of Schiller's ;
"Wallenstein's Lager" by members of i
the various vereins in costume. The \
entire entertainment was received
with applause and the various com- !
mittees deserve the highest praise for
Â§ their untiring efforts to make a sue- !
cess of the Sunday and last night's
programmes.

president of ,the university. Mr.; Earl
presided, but did. not request the news
paper reporters*" to remain at the
executive session, as former Governor
Budd did on one occasion to the utter
astonishment of the Regent - body. '
The budget \u25a0 was reviewed V and
adopted in secret session. To-morrow
afternoon at Berkeley â¢'.; certain -facts
connected with the allowances to* the
various departments of ; the educa
tional institution will be imparted to
the press : of San ; Francisco. ' Request
; for the information was : made imme;
! diately after the board adjournedyes
i terday afternoon, but it was not com
plied with on the ground that it
shocked the professors ' to" receive
through - the press the first intelligence
touching the amount of ! their respec
tive salaries. The Regents therefore
voted that time should be given to the
secretary to enable/ him Ito > convey to
'each professor in ; a style of delicate .
felicity a brief resume of th^ board's
action on the budget.
The budget estimate of the income
for the ensuing year is $923,916 50. It
is contemplated that the sum of $934,"
069 25 must be disbursed. Income
slightly in excess of the amount esti
mated is expected. Of the sum al
lowed salaries to professors and other
| instructors and attaches will absorb
$477,262 79. It is figured that the run
j ning expenses will foot up $456,806 20.
: The sources of income are thus
i enumerated: . '
Two-cent State tax. $295,000; State bonds,
iLterest. $49,845; mortgages/ $102,561 ; Bear
Gulch water, $4100; stock*. $2435; Johnson and
i First street buildings $45,500; . rents, $39,030;
; fee*. $34,797; United States Government,'s4o,
| 000; agricultural products. $2700; medical. de-
I partment, $21,000; various State appropriations,
$284,000; Mrs. Hearst. $8500; Carnegie, $4000;
annual gifts. $9207; prises, $2000.
The board allows $25,000 for baths for
men in Harmon Gymnasium and $8700
for baths for women in Hearst Hall.
SIGX PETITION. I
On the recommendation of the finance
committee the" Regents voted to sign
the petition to permit the Sutter street
railroad to put up overhead , wires ; on
Sutter street. The university owns the
Johnson building and land on Sutter
street, and the Regents therefore elgn
as property owners. Yet the property,
by reason of public ownership, Â«s ex
empt from taxation. '
The new law relating to the registra
tion of nurses is to be administ^rei un
dei the auspices of the Regents of the
State University. The nurses will not
be paraded, looked over and ! passed on
separately by the Regents at \u25a0 Mark
j Hopkins Institute of Art, but their fit
ness to perform nursing duty will "be
vouched for in . a . sense by the regent
body. Each nurse registered- must pay
a fee of $5. The. secretary of the Board
; of Regents is to be * the custodian of the
'\u25a0. money. On behalf of the; Regents, Dr.
i George F. Reinhardt; and' Dr. A. E.
1 S paid ing are .to act ' as : examiners.
i Genevieve Cook, Elizabeth : Ash and
i Helen Chriswell will act: as examiners
! for the Calif orjkia" Nurses' Association.
! Regent YorJfe fancied that the board
I was surrendering too much power to
the association. \u25a0\u25a0 , " '.
!' Judge Waymire thought ; that the
! work of examining nurses was foreign
to the duties of the Board of Regents.
Regent Budd said:"The law puts
this work on us, and we must take our
' medicine." *
Regent Waymire said: "I am not sure
that the law can put this burden on us.
Such work is not contemplated by the
organic act." - . .
Regent Yorke . advised the ' board to
proceed with caution. .He suggested a
reference of the subject to the attorney
of the board. :
President Wheeler reminded the Re
gents that . the law ; required the â¢ first
examination to take place in July, 1905.
The subject was referred to Charles
E. Snook, attorney:of the, board,, with
instructions to report at the meeting in
"Berkeley next Tuesday. , ; ; , ;
The following reappbintments 'rec
ommended by President Wheeler were
approved: :.. Dr. George A. Reisner,
Hearst lecturer in Egyptology; Dr.
Max Uhle, Hearst lecturer in Peru
vian archaeology; Mrs.' Zelia Nuttall,
field director of : the Crocker- Reid re
search in Mexico.- .
The president also recommended
that the. resignation be accepted -. of
Dr. R.H. Curtlss as. Carnegie assistant
at the! Lick Observatory. ; Dr. . Curtiss
has been appointed : : assistant astron
omer in the Allegheny; Observatory.
Adopted^ That the resignation be , a^r
cepted of Charles Mills Bakewell,'; pro

south to some of the low. lands of San

DISPOSING OF CITY'S SEWAGE
To the Editor of The Call:
I notice that there is a good deal of
discussion as to. the best mode of dis- !
posing of 'the Sari Francisco "sewage..
Surely the city will find a better
method than dumping it any lgnger
into, the bay or ocean; That method
has been the | ciirse of .most ,7 European'
cities. - You go to-day to; the large
commercial cities in England;or,Scot

T~r* NTERPRISE in a unique form has been rewarded by thetvic
r^ tory California vegetable growers and canners have achieved
4â ' over the destructive parasite, asparagus rust, which had
threatened by its injury to the crop to stop the development of a
comparatively new California industry. This victory was aided by i
the investigations of the experiment station of the University of j
California College of Agriculture. .The circumstances under which V
the ' fight against the rust was undertakenâ the methods of. orig-'
inating the good work, are without precedent, and are most noteT
worthy for the determination shown to overcome difficulties' and for
the success achieved. . . -
Canning of asparagus on a commercial basis has been practiced '
for only , a few years in California. - The - business promised to be 4
very profitable to both producer and canner. We now have 7000!
acres devoted to it, and the product averages 5000 pounds. of mer-'j
chantable asparagus per acre. Our prospects in the industry were
greatly increased by the appearance of the rust disease^ in other
parts of the country,. principally New Jersey ,'and ! Long Island, which
crippled their canning operations and started a big demand for; the |
California goods.- Then the rust began to ruin the ; crops here. The i
asparagus interests . took alarm and r sought the aid of the [College !
of Agriculture. To give efficient aid the college^ Required special
funds. They had no men - available forthe purpose. An attempt to
get the Legislature to -pass an^ acttornake the ; work ; possible failed/

to count tearfully, the days '.'until T the

After "school and on Saturdays he
planned expeditions and excursions,' but
Graham refused to go unless Ethel was
to be one of the party. And'Roscoe
did not dare to sulk. i
The three ', weeks ' were almost at an

the direction of Roscoe any more. Not
even the tempting ; off er of chocolate

her allegiance. ., But Roscoe counted
that in three days Graham would be
gone. ,One morning there' came a let

"Graham had- lived >in -Europe,"*, he
told her, "and now he is going to; live

West, and shoot
Indians, and be a

And Ethel had
bobbed her golden

through the tangle.
And Roscoe sold
his pearl penknife
for 5 ( cents with

Graham did not
have to wait long.
Ethel came home
from school with

THE CALL recently reviewed the decision of-the United States
Supreme Court, by which the ten hour labor law; of New York
was invalidated. The attention given to that decision by the
press of the country justifies the statement in Justice Harlan's dis
senting opinion, that it is the most important decision ever rendered
by the court. Justice Harlan, however, did* not reason but his
dissent. He did not tell why the majority opinion was wrong as a
construction of the constitution. As the case went up solely upon
the constitutional question involved, and could have reached the
court upon no other issue, we are left in the dark by Justice Harlan,
whose dissent may have been based upon his belief that a constitu
tional question was .lacking in the issue. ;
j But his colleague, Mr. Justice Holmes, who also dissented, has
not left us in the dark upon the subject. He admits the presence
of a constitutional question, but attacks the construction put upon
the fundamental law by the majority of the court. Justice Holmes
is a son of- Oliver Wendell Holmes, who was a great -literary char
acter, full of the poetic imagination. Reading the son's dissenting
opinion, one is led to believe that he has inherited the imagination
of his father and feels justified in taking poetic license with* the
\u25a0 fundamental law. In his brief dissent he says : ; "A constitution
is not intended to embody^a particular economic theory, whether df
paternalism and the organic relation of the citizen to the state, or of
laissez faire."' He denies the propriety of strict construction, 'and
contends that new theories may be read into the constitution
whether they agree with its letter or not '/.,^
It must* be' confessed that he has some\vhat t distinguished pre
cedent for this view. The legal tender decision of that court, re
versing its former decision written by Chief Justice Chase, con
fessedly did not rest upon the constitution at all, but declared that
the. United States, being a sovereignty, had the right to impose its
promise to pay upon its citizens as a legal tender in their personal
transactions. By that decision a contract made in gold became
payable in the depreciated legal tender greenback currency issued
l>y the Government. In other words, it invaded the right of con
tract. What that decision meant is still fresh enough in the public
mind to make men wince. Taking the ground that the United States
could impair a contract and compel its execution in a depreciated
money because other sovereignties had done the same thing/ the
court relit the fast dying fires of the unsound money cult, and, in
the years that followed up to 1897, kept the Treasury on the point
of collapse, and cost the country hundreds of millions of dollars.
Xot keeping in view these sorry consequences of a more than
latitudinarian construction of the constitution, Justice Holmes now
contends that the court need not pretend to construe the consti
tution at all, but may read into it a prohibition of the freedonvof
contract in order "to keep up with the spirit of progress."
This is the most dangerous doctrine that ever came from an
American court. It means that the sentimental view of a majority
of the Supreme Court may not only amend the constitution, but may
suspend or annul it, and may read into it that which lis in exact
contradiction of its spirit and letter. If a majority of the court
can tamper with the fourteenth amendment as Justice Holmes does,
it may do likewise with any part of the constitution/ The four
teenth amendment was adopted for the avowed purpose of securing
life. liberty and property, and all of the rights necessary to their
enjoyment. If the court can set aside the fourteenth amendment
and destroy the right of contract, without which liberty is impos
sible and the right to live is denied, it can just as easily read out.
of the constitution the thirteenth amendment and restore chattel
slavery. There is no more difficulty in doing the one than the!
other. \u25a0 . .'
Indeed, we declare it is probable that the negro would be less
injured by a judicial return to chattel slavery than whites and
negroes are jointly injured by being deprived of freedom of con
tract upon which depends their enjoyment of liberty and life. We
put it no stronger than the nature of the issue demands when we
say that the declaration of Justice Holmes that the court can deny
the right of individual contract means that the court claims the
right to deny the right of any man to live at all. If a man has no
right to make an individual contract for his work, he has no assert
ablc right to work, and without work he cannot sustain 'life and
must perforce surrender it.
We presume that Justice Holmes would recoil from that logical
projection , of his opinion to its inevitable consequence. /. But he
cannot deny the logic and propriety of that projection. Except one
royal decree in France, the right of individual contract, is 'written
nowhere except in the constitution of the United States. It is
everywhere recognized as a primordial right, inherent" in the en
'dovvment of man with wants which only his labor ; can satisfy.
Therefore the right to labor and to safeguard it by contract is a nat
ural right, and its protection in the constitution simply puts that in
strument in line with the law of nature.
There has always been debate between the strict construction
ists and the latitudinarians. But the latter only claimed the free
dom of construction in line with the spirit and letter of the con
stitution. Justice Holmes asserts the monstrous doctrine that the
court can drop construction entirely, and read into the instrument
principles antagonistic to its obvious meaning and destructive of its
purpose. Truly it was important that the court repudiate this doc
trine, as it did in its decision of the case. , '

Evidently the Knnisel Quartet has
b een remembered from its former visits
here. Evidently the quartet has been
as favorably remembered as it deserves
to \u25a0 be. Lyric Hall last night for the
first of the Kneisel concerts was hand
somely filled with 1 as finely musical an
audience as San Francisco counts. â¢
\ The Beethoven quartet in F. major
(Russian) was the chief work given
last evening, two movements of a new
quartet by a new Frenchman, C. A.
Debussy, being the novelty of the pro
gramme.* It was in the Beethoven that
one a little missed; the last bigness,
the last freedom. . But it was air very
charming, very classic, very graceful.
It is impossible to imagine anything
more limpidly clear than the staccati
in the allegretto, more gravely distin
guished than the adagio. ; The Debussy
quartet is a distinct acquisition, to
quartet It Is pre-eminently
of the new French school, something
of the Gc-dard quality, but distinctly
characteristic. The first movement;
' andantlno doucement expressif," has
a distinct flavor- of Wagner in V the
tonality, in .the' breadth and freedom
of the themes. It is broad and flowing
in movement and most musical. Grieg,
one feelsthe influence of, in 'the sec
ond movement, . "assez vIU et blen
rhythme." Here one gets the salt north
ern feel m . the Â« harmony, and a
Griegish . grotesqueness in the humor.
The movement is , truly picturesque,
dramatic. Both, were played with mas
terly sympathy. y ,
The Haydn quartet in D, a favorite
of the Kopta Quartet, closed the pro
gramme, -and the Kneieels; were - pos
sibly at their best therein. They will
be heard again at the St. Francis, on"
Thursday evening and at Lyric Hall
on Friday, and a rare feast is assured
to any music lover. : -

MADE DOCTORS

The California Club festival at the
Palace, billed for Thursday night, Fri
day night, . Saturday afternoon and
night, promises to make the New York
Federation festival at the Waldorf-
Astoria look pale and anemic.
There's something in the way San
Franciscans get at things that makes
them "go." Perhaps it's the tang of
the salt sea air, or the breath from the
Sierras, but, whatever the stimulant.
It puts an amazing amount of ginger
into things. And that's the quality
that will make the undertaJcing of the
California Club a thing to tell your
children about.
The ballroom, the marble, maple and
conservatory rooms are in the hands of
the erstwhile enemies of order â the car
penters, electricians, decorators and a
vhole herd of workersâ but wait Wait
till Thursday night, and you'll find a
corner from every interesting nation on
the globe. And "Buch an army of pretty
women as will serve silently â but dis
creetly â in the seraglios of Turkey,
burn incense and dance the sinuous
dances of the temples of Egypt, and â
oh, do load," of interesting things that
I've been wrorn.hand and foot not to
tell. And I won't â Just to prove that
â¢women can keep a secret, even if it is
en awful wrench.
The Music Section, under Mrs. John
D. Slbley, Is furnishing the general
programme to be given in the ballroom
on the three evenings and at the Sat
urday matinee, and it will give to San
Franciscans as fine a musical feast as
they have listened to in many moons.
List ye to the people who will sing,,
and you'll know. Here are the pro
grammes:
Thursday evening â "Cha.n*on \u25a0 Provencal! 1 "
<iv.) \u25a0 Aqua), Mrs. Thomas Kusan; flute solo.
â¢Caprice Mllitaire" (Verscbak); "Lo. the Gen

: ? Yesterday, the; board' of directors of
the Clubhouse Association met in sol
emn, conclave, and the above deduction
was the.outcome-ramid a lot of well
balanced enthusiasm.

of the architectural joys of thelcity,

courts, with alluring palms to refresh
the eye.' '" : '">. *;â¢\u25a0;'' \u25a0\u25a0 '
; -That 'there is' a * demand for a big

Now : that phase'; has been
ItUs decided that a splendid. big build
ing,, like ! the club^bulldlngs : in; New

Francisco is growing, and like the little
boy wlio -buys his ; clothes too "big, so
"he'll grow into them," the clubhouse
must be built to flt future conditions.

Not an Angel was permitted to pass i
through the scorer's gate by the Com- !
muters in the game at Idora, Park yes- j
terday afternoon, and in the course of j
nine innings three of Motley's cherubs j
were banished from the 'diamond for !
questioning the ruling? of Lord High !
Dictator Bull Perrine. The Oaks regis
tered seven times and gleaned eleven
hits, while the southrons gathered in
eleven safe Dingles with their goose
eggs. Thirteen players from Morley's
stable were in the going at various
stages of the . battle, and so numerous
were the shifts and make-up of the
Angels that the scorer had , to sign a
boy to assist him in keeoing track of I
the changes.
Iberg floated them over for the local
aggregation, and when he had the
game put away in pickle withdrew in
the eighth inning because of a pain in j
his side. Moskiman twirled the contest
out. . Left-winger Harry Goodwin was
on the firing mound for the men from
Los Angeles, and his offerings pleased
the Oaks mightily, for they soaked him
for nine safeties in six innings, when
he retired in favor of Torren.
Five hits and two runs were made :
off Goodjvin , in the fifth period. Two
other tallies , were captured by Van,,
Haltren's minions in the third "frame
and another in the seventh spasm.
Captain Dillon was expelled from the
battle in the fifth inning, and Smith
and Flood were commanded to take a
back seat with their boss in the seventh
inning. Before Flood went to the bench
he shook. hands with Umpire : Perrine
and congratulated the latter that it
was no worse. With Dillon, Flood and
Smith out' of action the Angels lost
heart and played carelessly. Score:
Los Angeles â Oaklandâ

taken to the Harbor Emergency Hospital,
vher* Dr. Herzog pumped out' his stomach,

He e^vÂ« Â«s a . reason for his rash act that
he was in love with a beautiful girl who &\<l
tiot reciprocate hia attentions. Even after the
poison was removed from "his system, he said
he wanted to die. "Life," b* declared, "has
no charrni* f oj- mÂ« unless my inamorata is by
try side." He demanded another deadly po
tioTi. Dr. \u25a0 Herxog handed him a harmless
colored concoction, which he told the would-be
ruiclde would do the business and carry him
away to the "maspiens of the blert." Kunze
at this point decided that he wanted to re
main on earth, and spurned the "pink tinted
Â«cpe." Later in the day he fully recovered
end walked cut cf the hospital with a jaunty,

â¢/Special "^Dispatch to^Th* CalL
The schooner Carmencita, aocord-
Ing to Information received in this
city,- is jsaillng north toward the seal
ing: grounds. Under what commls
eion or under what flag she sails no
one knows.
When the. vessel left Victoria three
months agro the authorities there
gave her a provisional 'register. .'This
register vras granted to her on the
express understanding of her com
mander, Captain Alec . McLean, that
she was going to Acapulco. Captain
McLean, it is reported, stated to the
British authorities that it was his in
tention ' when he arrived at Acapulco
to change the name of the Carmen
cita to Acapulco and reregister her at
that. port. Renamed and reregistered
Â«he would be. under the laws, allowed
to go into the sealing grounds and
th>re .work at her own free will.
Captnin McLean never took the
Carmencita to Acapulco. 5 He did not
go near Acapulco. Instead, he ran
" Into Drakes Bay. where he came to a
safe anchorage. His next move was
to take on board a complete sealing
outfit; including several sealing guns.
His crew was quietly signed In San
Francisco and taken over to I Drakes
Bay. where they boarded her. The
schooner was well provisioned with
food. together with a - large
quantity of whisky. The Carmen
cita had no sooner started north on
her pelagic sealing . expedition than
trouble arose oh board. The crew.
made an . onslaught on the whisky,
and fights were the order of the. day.
Finally the vessel reached Cloyo
quat, near Vancouver Island, where
three members of, the crew deserted
hfr. At that time she was bound
, *irai?rht for the sealing grounds.
Under whet flag she Is flying at the
present moment no one knows. She
railed away from British Columbia
\u25a0nith the British flag flying at her
mainmast. If she should ever ven
ture to return to British Columbia
again Captain McLean will have a
hard time trying to explain his ex
traordinary movements.

The latest development in ,thÂ«
liquidaUon of the debts of the Pacific
Coast Savings and Loan Society waÂ»
the filing yesterday of an attachment
for $160,000 on the property of C 8.
Benedict of the Hastings Clothin*
Company, of -which heis president.'
Shortly after the collapse of thÂ«
savings society. Benedict and his wlf â¢
were asphyxiated at their home and
the wife's death ensued. . "When be re
covered Benedict immediately^ de
parted for Honolulu, where he has
since remained. ; . â¢ \u0084 ..
It* Is with the view of bringing him
within the Jurisdiction of . the Califor
nia courts that yesterday's attachment
was levied, the hope of the attorneys
being that Benedict will be forced to
return to California to defend the ac
tion .brought against him. HÂ« wu
vice president of , the Pacific Coast So
ciety, of which "Wendell Easton vu
the president.
Benedict. Easton and ; Harry Francis)
were removed from the' board of trus
tees at the instance of a suit brought
by the State Attorney General and thÂ»
action filed yesterday was a . move of
the new. .board of trustees, of .which,
Barclay Henley is president. Benedict
being the wealthiest of the former
trustees, was one of the reasons of
the attachment being filed against him,'
but the laws of the State are that each
of the trustees is responsible for. ths
management 'ff the society.
It is said that the estate of George
Easton, a former trustee, valued at
about $100,000. Is liable for action.
The present board of trustees \u25a0Is now
managing \u25a0 the affair of ' collecting ami
paying off the" funds. *

â¢ Charles K. Mclntosh, cashier of the
First National Bank, swore out a war
rant, for the arrest of .William Bar
* rett before Police Judge Cabaniss yes
terday afternoon on a charge of grand
larceny. Barrett Is the man who stole
the sack containing $20,000 from the
bank on September VI and dropped it
In the Brooklyn Hotel. He made his
escape, but is now \u25a0 under arrest in
Portland and -will be brought here for

The retiring officer, prior to coming
to this city to accept the place with
the North Shore Company, was for five
years general passenger agent of the
Rio Grande Western Railroad, and is
regarded as one of the brightest young
traffic men in the railroad world, a
fact that was mainly responsible for
his selection for the position he will
coon assume. The smelting company
is the second largest in this country
and has interests in nearly every min
ing section in the United States, which
insures Heintz a wide territory in
which to operate and a magnificent
salary. â¢
- It was stated yesterday at the gen
eral offices of the North Shore Road
that Heintz's retirement is deeply re
gretted by President Foster and
other officials of the company, who
fully appreciated, his services as a
freight and passenger traffic man.
~^+
Warrant Out for Barrett.
George W. Helnti. for two years as
sistant general freight and passenger
agent of the Xorth Shore Railroad
Company, has resigned his position and
will leave for Salt Lake in about two
weeks to enter upon the duties of traf
fic manager for one of the big smelt
ing and mining concerns of the East.
His resignation was handed to Presi
dent A. XV. Foster of the North Shore
road two days ago and will take ef
fect on June 1. As yet no one has been
eelected \o fill the vacancy. -
In December, y 1904. \u25a0 there were nineteen
marriage Hcer.ssa issued that have not been
recorded. In January. 1905, there were thirty.
nlnÂ« of such licenses, and in February the
number Jumped to forty-nine. This plainly
shows that some persons are violating the law
in not presenting the marriage licensee of
parties who -have been Joined \u25a0 in wedlock "to
th<Â» recorder within thirty daye after the mar
riage ceremony, ily construction of the law is
that the marriage -iÂ« not legal until the license
Is recorded. Just as in the case of a deedfor
the conveyance of property. Of course it i*
possible that a few, but very few, marriage
licensee are not used, but - the number 'is %
small. that- ft cannot be taken Into consider^
tion. A minister brought us a license T= fn
record which had been Issued seven yea?s ago
and had been slumbering ever since. I nro
poie to take steps to compel complianc* with
the law. although the taÂ«k will bÂ» a disVgTee
able ooe to me. . . - c .
The punishment is imprisonment for
not less than three months nor more
than one year and . a fine of not less
than $100 nor more than $1000.
In December .Recorder Godchaux ar
ranged with County Clerk Greif to have
the marriage licenses numbered con
secutively in order that it could be
determined whether any marriage; li
censes were missing in the book of rec
ords. The Recorder said yesterday: *'\u25a0\u25a0
The last session of the Legislature
passed an amendment to section 360
of the Political Code which was - ap
proved by the Governor on March 21,
1905, aa follows:
360. Every person authorized â¢ to eolemnlzc
any marriage, who solemnizes such marriage
without first being preeented . with the mar
riage license, as required by section seventy^
two of the Civil Code or. this State, or who
willfully makes a false return of any mar-,
rlage or pretended marriage to the recorder;
or who, having solemnized a marriage, fails
for more than thirty days to file with such
recorder the/ marriage license with the cer
tificate Indorsed thereon, as required by sec
tions seventy-three and teventy-f our .of the
Civil Code of this State; and every person who
willfully makes a false record of any mar
riage return, is punishable as provided in the
preceding eection. . â¢ .Â».. ,
The law requiring marriage licenses
to be recorded is continually disre
garded notwithstanding the severe pen
alty for violation. â¢
